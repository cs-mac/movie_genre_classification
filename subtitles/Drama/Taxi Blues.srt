1
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,317
Harry, answer that.

2
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:35,906
So, what do you want to hack for, Bickle?

3
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,741
I can't sleep nights.

4
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,953
- There's porno theaters for that.
- I know. I tried that.

5
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,876
So what do you do now?

6
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:52,089
Ride around nights mostly.
Subways, buses.

7
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:55,175
Figured if I'm gonna do that,
I might as well get paid for it.

8
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:57,719
Wanna work uptown nights,
South Bronx, Harlem?

9
00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:01,139
- I'll work anytime, anywhere.
- Will you work Jewish holidays?

10
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,016
Anytime, anywhere.

11
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:05,269
Let me see your chauffeur's license.

12
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,648
<i>- Give me one cab.</i>
- How's your driving record?

13
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:12,860
It's clean, real clean, like my conscience.

14
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,444
Are you gonna break my chops?

15
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:17,072
Got trouble with guys like you
breaking my chops.

16
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:20,826
If you're gonna break my chops,
you can take it on the arches. Understand?

17
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,870
Sorry, sir. I didn't mean that.

18
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,748
- Physical?
- Clean.

19
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:28,417
- Age?
- Twenty-six.

20
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,002
Education?

21
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,004
Some.

22
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,882
Here, there, you know.

23
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,633
<i>Hey, Horowitz!</i>

24
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,595
Military record?

25
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:41,972
Honorable discharge...

26
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:44,391
May 1973.

27
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,269
- Were you in the army?
- Marines.

28
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:51,106
I was in the Marines, too.

29
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:56,945
So what is it? You need an extra job?

30
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,741
Are you moonlighting?

31
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:05,579
I just want to work long hours.
What's moonlighting?

32
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:11,001
Look, just fill out these forms and
check back tomorrow when the shift breaks.

33
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,587
<i>O'Brien, please step up.</i>

34
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:17,925
Take the car out to 58th Street, please,
'cause it's crowded on 57th.

35
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:30,812
All right, I'm coming down there.

36
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:32,314
Let's go.

37
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:14,982
<i>May 10.</i>

38
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:18,068
<i>Thank God for the rain</i>
<i>which has helped wash away...</i>

39
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:21,029
<i>the garbage and trash off the sidewalks.</i>

40
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:24,366
<i>I'm working long hours now.</i>

41
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,577
<i>6:00 in the afternoon</i>
<i>to 6:00 in the morning...</i>

42
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,412
<i>sometimes even 8:00 in the morning.</i>

43
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:31,373
<i>Six days a week,</i>
<i>sometimes seven days a week.</i>

44
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,710
<i>It's a long hustle, but it keeps me real busy.</i>

45
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,337
<i>I can take in $300, $350 a week...</i>

46
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:39,965
<i>sometimes even more</i>
<i>when I do it off the meter.</i>

47
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,867
<i>All the animals come out at night.</i>

48
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:12,706
<i>Whores, skunk pussies, buggers,</i>
<i>queens, fairies, dopers, junkies.</i>

49
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:15,751
<i>Sick, venal.</i>

50
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:22,925
<i>Someday a real rain'll come</i>
<i>and wash this scum off the streets.</i>

51
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:35,395
<i>I go all over. I take people to the Bronx,</i>
<i>Brooklyn, I take them to Harlem.</i>

52
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:39,066
<i>I don't care. Don't make no difference to me.</i>

53
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:42,402
<i>It does to some.</i>
<i>Some won't even take spooks.</i>

54
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:44,071
<i>Don't make no difference to me.</i>

55
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:46,114
Driver, 48th and 6th please.

56
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:49,326
Man, you're a gorgeous, brown,
beautiful little girl.

57
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,751
- I can't afford to get stopped anywhere.
- No, we wouldn't want that to happen.

58
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:01,713
There'll be a big tip in it for you,
if you do the right things.

59
00:07:01,964 --> 00:07:03,423
You got a way.

60
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:07,886
Yeah, now you're talking.

61
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,431
Driver, hurry up, will you?

62
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:14,268
Yeah, it's gonna be fine.

63
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:51,638
<i>Each night when I return the cab</i>
<i>to the garage...</i>

64
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:54,224
<i>I have to clean the come off the back seat.</i>

65
00:07:59,021 --> 00:08:01,440
<i>Some nights I clean out the blood.</i>

66
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:36,350
Can I help you?

67
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:38,393
Yeah, what's your name?

68
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:42,564
- My name is Travis.
- That's nice. What can I do for you?

69
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,402
I'd like to know what your name is.
What's your name?

70
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:49,738
Give me a break.

71
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:53,617
You can tell me what your name is.
I'm not gonna do anything.

72
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:57,538
- Do you want me to call the manager?
- You don't have to, I'm just asking...

73
00:08:57,621 --> 00:08:59,998
- Troy!
- All right, okay.

74
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:05,212
Can I have a chuckles there?

75
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:11,009
You have any jujubes? They last longer.
I'd like to get some.

76
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:13,637
What you see is what we got.

77
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:23,981
I'll take these.

78
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:27,776
Coca-Cola.

79
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:31,280
We don't have Coca-Cola.
Royal Crown Cola is all we got.

80
00:09:33,115 --> 00:09:35,158
$1.85.

81
00:09:57,306 --> 00:10:00,434
<i>Twelve hours of work, and I still can't sleep.</i>

82
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:02,603
<i>Damn!</i>

83
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,105
<i>The days go on and on.</i>

84
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:07,107
<i>They don't end.</i>

85
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:11,778
<i>All my life needed</i>
<i>was a sense of some place to go.</i>

86
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:16,700
<i>I don't believe that one should devote</i>
<i>his life to morbid self-attention.</i>

87
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:20,454
<i>I believe that someone should become</i>
<i>a person like other people.</i>

88
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:27,544
<i>I first saw her at Palantine Campaign</i>
<i>Headquarters at 63rd and Broadway.</i>

89
00:10:28,504 --> 00:10:30,672
<i>She was wearing a white dress.</i>

90
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:33,675
<i>She appeared like an angel.</i>

91
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:36,678
<i>Out of this filthy mess...</i>

92
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:39,014
<i>she is alone.</i>

93
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:43,310
<i>They cannot...</i>

94
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:47,105
<i>touch her.</i>

95
00:10:59,243 --> 00:11:00,994
Yes, well...

96
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:05,332
you delivered two boxes.
I think it's a total of 5,000 campaign buttons.

97
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:10,087
Now, on all the ones we had before,
our slogan is "We are the people"...

98
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:13,841
and "are" is underlined.
These new buttons have "we" underlined.

99
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,510
That reads "We are the people."

100
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:19,346
Well, I think there's a difference.

101
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:22,975
"We are the people" is not the same as
"We are the people."

102
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:25,060
Let's not fight.

103
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:28,605
Look, we'll make it real simple.

104
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:33,360
We don't pay for the buttons.
We throw the buttons away, all right?

105
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:34,987
Come here a minute.

106
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:38,156
What?

107
00:11:45,998 --> 00:11:50,335
This canvas report is ready. If Andy okays it,
send copies to headquarters...

108
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:53,547
I got to get that <i>New York Times</i>
article Xeroxed. That has to be...

109
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,175
- Don't forget the new photos.
- I didn't forget. Look...

110
00:11:56,258 --> 00:11:58,886
We have to emphasize
the Mandatory Welfare Program.

111
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:02,598
- That's the issue that should be pushed.
- First push the man, then the issue.

112
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:07,394
Sen. Palantine is a dynamic man.
An intelligent, interesting, fresh...

113
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,647
- You forgot sexy.
- I did not forget sexy.

114
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:13,692
Listen to yourself.
You sound like you're selling mouthwash.

115
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:16,403
- We are selling mouthwash.
- Are we authorized to do that?

116
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:17,571
Very funny.

117
00:12:17,613 --> 00:12:20,949
We can get in trouble selling
pharmaceuticals in a campaign office.

118
00:12:21,033 --> 00:12:23,202
My uncle's in jail because of that.

119
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:28,040
It's not really jail.
Living with his wife, anything would be jail.

120
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:30,209
- Look over there.
- I love you.

121
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:32,920
- Notice anything?
- No.

122
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:35,964
- Put your glasses on.
- Okay. Just a minute.

123
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:39,593
- All right.
- That taxi driver's been staring at us.

124
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:52,648
- What taxi driver?
- That one. The one that's sitting there.

125
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:56,735
- How long has he been there?
- I don't know, but it feels like a long time.

126
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:58,862
- Does he bother you?
- No.

127
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:01,615
You really mean yes,
and you're being sarcastic.

128
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:04,993
- You're quick. You're really quick.
- I try to be real quick.

129
00:13:05,077 --> 00:13:07,663
Tell you what.
I'll play the male in this relationship.

130
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:09,581
- I'll go out...
- Good luck.

131
00:13:09,665 --> 00:13:11,208
And tell him to move.

132
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:15,754
- And I don't need good luck. Thank you.
- Yes, you do. You just think you don't.

133
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:27,975
You're blocking our doorway.
You think you might wanna move the cab?

134
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:11,203
You know, eye shadow, mascara...

135
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,080
lipstick, rouge.

136
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:15,624
Not rouge. "Blush-on" they call it.

137
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:19,920
- The kind with the brush.
- Yeah. It's blush-on.

138
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:24,758
- Travis!
- Wiz.

139
00:15:24,842 --> 00:15:27,386
That's blush-on. My wife uses it.

140
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:30,013
Ask Travis. He's a ladies' man.

141
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:32,474
A cup of coffee, please.

142
00:15:32,516 --> 00:15:35,561
Anyway, whatever the fuck it is,
she uses a lot of it, you know.

143
00:15:35,644 --> 00:15:37,855
Then perfume, the spray kind.

144
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:40,774
Get this.
In the middle of the Triborough bridge...

145
00:15:40,858 --> 00:15:44,027
and this woman is beautiful,
she changes her pantyhose.

146
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:45,696
- No.
- Oh, yeah.

147
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:48,699
- What did you do?
- I threw the meter, you know.

148
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:53,412
I jump in the backseat, whip it out,
and I say, "You know what this is?"

149
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:58,208
She says, "It's love." I'm gonna
fuck her brains out. She goes wild.

150
00:15:58,417 --> 00:16:01,628
And she said, "It's the greatest
single experience of my life."

151
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:05,424
She gave me a $200 tip
and her phone number in Acapulco.

152
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:09,136
Travis, you know Doughboy, Charlie T?

153
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:12,681
Hey, Travis, got change for a nickel?

154
00:16:13,182 --> 00:16:16,310
We call him Doughboy
'cause he'll do anything for a buck.

155
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:19,938
So, how's it hanging?

156
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:25,485
What's that?

157
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:32,701
I just heard on the radio some fleet driver
from Bell just got all cut up.

158
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:36,455
- Stickup?
- No, he got cut up by some crazy fucker.

159
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:38,457
- Cut half his ear off.
- Where?

160
00:16:38,874 --> 00:16:40,792
They said 122nd Street.

161
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:44,713
Fucking Mau Mau land.

162
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:49,760
You run all over town, don't you?

163
00:16:51,762 --> 00:16:53,013
Travis?

164
00:16:59,895 --> 00:17:02,439
- You run all over town, don't you?
- Yeah.

165
00:17:02,523 --> 00:17:05,359
I mean,
you handled some pretty rough customers.

166
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,027
Yeah, I have.

167
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:10,405
- You carry a piece?
- No.

168
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:12,366
- You need one?
- No.

169
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:16,495
If you ever need one, I know a fellow
who can get you a real nice deal.

170
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:18,038
Lots of shit around.

171
00:17:18,497 --> 00:17:20,999
I never use mine. I'm conservative.

172
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:25,003
But it's a good thing to have just as a threat.

173
00:17:35,973 --> 00:17:37,891
I'm gonna go do my dirt.

174
00:17:39,643 --> 00:17:40,686
Travis.

175
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:43,856
Look.

176
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:47,234
A piece of Errol Flynn's bathtub.

177
00:17:47,776 --> 00:17:49,444
Dig the symbols.

178
00:17:49,528 --> 00:17:53,198
"F- 4-0-5-4-3-4"

179
00:17:54,533 --> 00:17:55,742
The watermark.

180
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:58,120
There's one person.

181
00:17:58,495 --> 00:18:01,999
There's two persons,
and there's three persons.

182
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:04,376
I got this at his estate, The Pines.

183
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:08,547
Why don't you take it? If you can sell it,
you give me half of what you got.

184
00:18:08,964 --> 00:18:10,340
I don't want it.

185
00:18:11,175 --> 00:18:13,594
I'm gonna get in my cab and boogie.

186
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:31,945
- I'm terribly sorry.
- What now?

187
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:34,781
- Nothing!
- That's very cute. Thank you.

188
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:37,451
Hey, you want to see something?

189
00:18:37,868 --> 00:18:40,913
Wait. I just typed,
"You want to see something?"

190
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:44,499
- What?
- lf you had...

191
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:49,129
these three fingers missing on this hand
and that hand missing on that hand...

192
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:51,715
how would you light a match?

193
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:54,968
- I wouldn't light a match.
- Go ahead, give it a try.

194
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,097
Well, I don't think I could do it.

195
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:00,474
No?

196
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:03,894
It's gonna be difficult. I'll give it a try.

197
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:15,197
I got my thumb back for a second.
Thank God.

198
00:19:16,615 --> 00:19:18,575
Just a minute.

199
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:27,292
I can't do it.

200
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:31,338
- The guy at the newsstand can do it.
- I don't work at a newsstand.

201
00:19:33,048 --> 00:19:34,967
- He's probably Italian.
- No.

202
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,760
- You sure he's not Italian?
- He's black.

203
00:19:36,844 --> 00:19:39,179
If he had been Italian,
he might have been a thief.

204
00:19:39,221 --> 00:19:41,515
They do that.
The mob does that a lot of times.

205
00:19:41,557 --> 00:19:44,434
If a thief screws up on the job,
they'll blow his fingers off.

206
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:47,271
I'll tell you something else.
It's like a joke, but true.

207
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:50,315
If they kill a stool pigeon,
they leave a canary on the body.

208
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:53,861
- Apparently it's symbolic.
- Why not a pigeon instead of a canary?

209
00:19:53,944 --> 00:19:56,780
I don't know why not a pigeon.
Wait a minute.

210
00:19:56,864 --> 00:20:00,033
You got to catch a pigeon.
A canary, you can walk into a pet store.

211
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:01,493
As long as you pay for it, boom.

212
00:20:01,577 --> 00:20:04,997
Kill it right there. Put it on anyone you want.
Doesn't matter.

213
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:34,359
- Hi. I'd like to volunteer.
- Great. I'll take you over here.

214
00:20:34,443 --> 00:20:37,154
I'd rather volunteer to her, if you don't mind.

215
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:43,327
Why do you feel that
you have to volunteer to me?

216
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:46,914
Because I think you are
the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.

217
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:53,045
Thanks. But what do you think of Palantine?

218
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:02,846
Charles Palantine, the man you're
volunteering to help elect President.

219
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:07,226
I'm sure he'll make a good president.
I don't know his policies...

220
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:09,436
but I'm sure he'll make a good one.

221
00:21:10,854 --> 00:21:12,940
- You want to canvass?
- I'll canvass.

222
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:16,235
How do you feel about
the Senator's stand on welfare?

223
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:20,405
I don't know the Senator's stand on welfare,
but I'm sure it's a good stand.

224
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:23,575
- Are you sure of that?
- Yeah.

225
00:21:26,745 --> 00:21:29,122
We all work together here full-time,
day and night.

226
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:32,543
If you would step over there,
I'm sure the gentleman will sign you up.

227
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:36,004
I drive a taxi at night, so it's hard for me...

228
00:21:36,797 --> 00:21:38,298
to work in the day.

229
00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:42,386
Then what exactly do you want?

230
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:45,514
Would you like to come
have some coffee and pie with me?

231
00:21:45,597 --> 00:21:47,015
Why?

232
00:21:47,099 --> 00:21:49,601
Why? I'll tell you why.

233
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:52,938
I think you're a lonely person.

234
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:55,315
I drive by this place a lot,
and I see you here.

235
00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:57,150
I see a lot of people around you...

236
00:21:57,234 --> 00:22:00,362
and I see all these phones
and stuff on your desk.

237
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:01,947
That means nothing.

238
00:22:02,614 --> 00:22:04,825
Then I came inside and met you...

239
00:22:04,908 --> 00:22:07,828
I saw in your eyes,
I saw the way you carried yourself...

240
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:10,289
that you're not a happy person.

241
00:22:10,706 --> 00:22:12,583
I think you need something.

242
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:15,878
If you want to call it a friend,
you can call it a friend.

243
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:19,256
- You're gonna be my friend?
- Yeah.

244
00:22:27,806 --> 00:22:29,183
What do you say?

245
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:36,648
It's a little hard standing here
and asking you, so...

246
00:22:41,403 --> 00:22:45,032
Five minutes. That's all.
Just outside, right around here.

247
00:22:45,115 --> 00:22:46,909
I'm there to protect you.

248
00:22:52,956 --> 00:22:55,042
Come on. Just take a little break.

249
00:22:58,212 --> 00:23:00,797
I have a break at 4:00, and if you're here...

250
00:23:00,881 --> 00:23:02,674
- 4:00 today?
- Yes.

251
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:05,260
- I'll be here.
- I'm sure you will.

252
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:09,056
- All right. 4:00 p. m?
- Right.

253
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,391
- Outside, in the front?
- Yes.

254
00:23:11,475 --> 00:23:14,937
Okay. My name is Travis. Betsy?

255
00:23:16,271 --> 00:23:17,564
- Travis.
- Yeah.

256
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,734
I appreciate this, Betsy.

257
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:37,960
<i>May 26, 4:00 p.m.</i>

258
00:23:38,043 --> 00:23:41,296
<i>I took Betsy to Child's Coffee Shop</i>
<i>on Columbus Circle.</i>

259
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:47,094
<i>I had black coffee and apple pie</i>
<i>with a slice of melted yellow cheese.</i>

260
00:23:47,636 --> 00:23:50,055
<i>I think that was a good selection.</i>

261
00:23:50,138 --> 00:23:54,518
<i>Betsy had coffee and a fruit salad dish.</i>
<i>But she could've had anything she wanted.</i>

262
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:57,771
15,000 volunteers in New York alone
is not bad...

263
00:23:57,855 --> 00:24:00,858
but, Christ, the organizational problems.

264
00:24:01,608 --> 00:24:04,278
I know what you mean.
I got the same problems.

265
00:24:04,778 --> 00:24:06,154
I got to get organized.

266
00:24:06,238 --> 00:24:09,491
You know, little things
like my apartment, my possessions.

267
00:24:10,659 --> 00:24:14,705
I should get a sign saying,
"One of these days I'll get organezized."

268
00:24:14,788 --> 00:24:17,958
- You mean organized?
- "Organeziezd."

269
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:21,086
Organeziezd. It's a joke.

270
00:24:22,045 --> 00:24:24,840
O-R-G-A-N-E-Z-I-E-Z-D.

271
00:24:24,923 --> 00:24:29,428
You mean organezized
like those office signs that say "thimk."

272
00:24:35,392 --> 00:24:37,519
Do you like the place you work in?

273
00:24:38,187 --> 00:24:40,355
We've got some good people
working for us...

274
00:24:40,439 --> 00:24:42,941
and I think Palantine's got a good chance.

275
00:24:46,195 --> 00:24:48,322
You know, you have beautiful eyes.

276
00:24:54,953 --> 00:24:58,165
- Do you like the guy you work with?
- He's okay.

277
00:25:00,751 --> 00:25:02,503
Yeah, but do you like him?

278
00:25:02,878 --> 00:25:05,547
He's funny, and he's very good at his job.
He's okay.

279
00:25:05,631 --> 00:25:09,843
- Though he does have a few problems.
- I would say he has quite a few problems.

280
00:25:11,261 --> 00:25:13,931
His energy seems to go in the wrong places.

281
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:17,559
When I walked in
and saw you two sitting there...

282
00:25:17,643 --> 00:25:22,064
I could tell by the way you both related
there was no connection whatsoever.

283
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:25,984
And I felt when I walked in
that there was something between us.

284
00:25:26,068 --> 00:25:28,904
There was an impulse
that we were both following.

285
00:25:28,987 --> 00:25:31,532
So that gave me the right
to come in and talk to you.

286
00:25:31,615 --> 00:25:34,826
Otherwise, I never would have felt
I had the right to talk to you...

287
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:36,078
or say anything to you.

288
00:25:36,161 --> 00:25:38,997
I never would have had the courage
to talk to you.

289
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:42,376
With him, I felt there was nothing,
and I could sense it.

290
00:25:42,459 --> 00:25:45,838
When I walked in, I knew I was right.
Did you feel that way?

291
00:25:49,091 --> 00:25:51,260
I wouldn't be here if I didn't.

292
00:25:53,762 --> 00:25:56,765
- Where are you from?
- Upstate.

293
00:26:00,477 --> 00:26:02,896
That fellow you work with, I don't like him.

294
00:26:02,938 --> 00:26:05,941
Not that I don't like him.
I just think he's silly.

295
00:26:08,026 --> 00:26:09,945
I don't think he respects you.

296
00:26:11,446 --> 00:26:14,533
I don't believe I've ever met anyone
quite like you.

297
00:26:25,794 --> 00:26:29,673
You wanna go to a movie with me?

298
00:26:31,049 --> 00:26:34,595
- I have to go back to work.
- I don't mean now. Like another time?

299
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,770
Sure. You know what you remind me of?

300
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:47,399
- What?
- That song.

301
00:26:48,692 --> 00:26:51,945
By Kris Kristofferson.

302
00:26:54,406 --> 00:26:56,909
- Who's that?
- The songwriter.

303
00:26:57,492 --> 00:27:00,871
He's a prophet and a pusher.

304
00:27:01,163 --> 00:27:05,083
Partly truth, partly fiction.
A walking contradiction.

305
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,672
- You saying that about me?
- Who else would I be talking about?

306
00:27:10,756 --> 00:27:13,175
I'm no pusher. I never have pushed.

307
00:27:14,009 --> 00:27:17,804
No, just the part about the contradictions.
You are that.

308
00:27:48,877 --> 00:27:51,213
<i>I called Betsy again at her office,</i>
<i>and she said...</i>

309
00:27:51,296 --> 00:27:54,883
<i>maybe we'd go to a movie</i>
<i>after she gets off work tomorrow.</i>

310
00:27:54,967 --> 00:27:57,469
<i>That's my day off. At first she hesitated.</i>

311
00:27:57,553 --> 00:28:00,722
<i>But I called her again and then she agreed.</i>

312
00:28:01,849 --> 00:28:06,562
<i>Betsy. No, Betsy what?</i>
<i>I forgot to ask her last name again.</i>

313
00:28:06,645 --> 00:28:09,857
<i>Damn. I got to remember stuff like that.</i>

314
00:28:21,034 --> 00:28:22,786
I don't think we have to worry about
anybody here committing themselves...

315
00:28:22,828 --> 00:28:24,538
I don't think we have to worry about
anybody here committing themselves...

316
00:28:24,621 --> 00:28:26,999
until things start coming in from California.

317
00:28:27,082 --> 00:28:30,252
This is just making me nervous.
We should have waited for the limo.

318
00:28:30,335 --> 00:28:34,339
I don't mind taking a cab, but I mind going
to California without preparing right.

319
00:28:34,423 --> 00:28:38,760
- That's gonna get us in trouble.
- Are you Charles Palantine, the candidate?

320
00:28:39,887 --> 00:28:41,096
Yes, I am.

321
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:44,725
I'm one of your biggest supporters.

322
00:28:44,766 --> 00:28:48,353
I tell everybody that comes in this taxi
that they have to vote for you.

323
00:28:48,437 --> 00:28:50,480
Why, thank you...

324
00:28:51,732 --> 00:28:52,774
Travis.

325
00:28:52,858 --> 00:28:56,236
I'm sure you're gonna win, sir.
Everybody I know is gonna vote for you.

326
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,906
In fact, I was gonna put one
of your stickers in my taxi.

327
00:28:58,989 --> 00:29:02,659
But the company said it was against
their policy, they don't know anything.

328
00:29:02,743 --> 00:29:05,245
- They're a bunch of jerks.
- Let me tell you something...

329
00:29:05,329 --> 00:29:08,332
I have learned more about America
from riding in taxi cabs...

330
00:29:08,415 --> 00:29:10,751
than in all the limos in the country.

331
00:29:12,044 --> 00:29:14,213
- Yeah?
- That's true.

332
00:29:15,339 --> 00:29:17,716
- Can I ask you something, Travis?
- Sure.

333
00:29:18,133 --> 00:29:21,762
What is the one thing about this country
that bugs you the most?

334
00:29:22,971 --> 00:29:27,017
Well, I don't know.
I don't follow political issues that closely.

335
00:29:28,352 --> 00:29:30,270
There must be something.

336
00:29:32,814 --> 00:29:35,275
Whatever it is,
you should clean up this city here...

337
00:29:35,317 --> 00:29:39,780
because this city is like an open sewer,
it's full of filth and scum.

338
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:42,032
Sometimes I can hardly take it.

339
00:29:42,115 --> 00:29:45,327
Whoever becomes the President
should just...

340
00:29:45,827 --> 00:29:48,121
really clean it up, know what I mean?

341
00:29:48,163 --> 00:29:51,708
Sometimes I go out and I smell it.
I get headaches, it's so bad.

342
00:29:51,792 --> 00:29:55,170
It's like, they just never go away, you know.

343
00:29:56,213 --> 00:29:59,466
The President should just
clean up this whole mess here.

344
00:29:59,508 --> 00:30:02,678
He should flush it right down
the fucking toilet.

345
00:30:10,769 --> 00:30:13,021
I think I know what you mean, Travis.

346
00:30:13,522 --> 00:30:15,691
But it's not gonna be easy.

347
00:30:15,774 --> 00:30:18,819
- We'll have to make some radical changes.
- Damn straight.

348
00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:23,991
- Here you go, Travis. Keep the change.
- Thank you.

349
00:30:27,536 --> 00:30:30,205
- Nice talking to you, Travis.
- Nice talking to you, sir.

350
00:30:30,289 --> 00:30:32,541
You're a good man.
I know you're gonna win.

351
00:30:32,624 --> 00:30:34,501
Thank you.

352
00:30:57,065 --> 00:30:59,943
Come on, man. Get me out of here, all right?

353
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,364
Come on!

354
00:31:05,324 --> 00:31:09,661
Come on, baby. This is a real drag.
Don't make no scene.

355
00:31:11,747 --> 00:31:15,209
You wanna get busted?
What's up, bitch, be cool!

356
00:31:23,509 --> 00:31:25,385
Don't start no trouble.

357
00:31:26,887 --> 00:31:30,516
Cabbie, forget about this. It's nothing.
Be cool, bitch.

358
00:32:24,403 --> 00:32:26,405
Get your ass out of here.

359
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:37,100
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

360
00:33:38,644 --> 00:33:41,438
- Did you have a nice day today?
- Not particularly.

361
00:33:41,522 --> 00:33:43,273
Got a present for you.

362
00:33:47,486 --> 00:33:50,489
Now back to Gene Krupa's
syncopated style shortly.

363
00:33:59,331 --> 00:34:00,916
Why'd you do that?

364
00:34:00,999 --> 00:34:03,293
What else am I gonna do with my money?

365
00:34:04,044 --> 00:34:06,296
I wish you would've listened to this.

366
00:34:06,713 --> 00:34:09,675
I would've, except my record player
doesn't work now.

367
00:34:10,092 --> 00:34:14,054
Your stereo's broken? How can you
stand it? I couldn't live without music.

368
00:34:14,096 --> 00:34:17,891
I don't follow music too much.
But I would really like to. I really would.

369
00:34:17,933 --> 00:34:20,769
- Then you haven't heard this record yet.
- No.

370
00:34:22,229 --> 00:34:26,275
But I was thinking, maybe we could listen
to it on your record player.

371
00:34:27,234 --> 00:34:30,779
Now going back to 40 years of Chick Webb.

372
00:34:47,171 --> 00:34:50,007
- You've got to be kidding.
- Why?

373
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:52,050
This is a dirty movie.

374
00:34:52,676 --> 00:34:55,429
No, this is a movie that...

375
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:58,557
a lot of couples come to,
all kinds of couples go here.

376
00:34:59,183 --> 00:35:02,769
- You sure about that?
- Yeah, I see them all the time.

377
00:35:06,982 --> 00:35:08,233
Come on.

378
00:35:47,231 --> 00:35:48,857
Excuse me!

379
00:35:48,941 --> 00:35:50,442
Shut the fuck up.

380
00:35:50,859 --> 00:35:52,903
- Where are you going?
- I have to leave now.

381
00:35:52,986 --> 00:35:53,987
Why?

382
00:35:54,071 --> 00:35:57,324
I don't know why I came in here.
I don't like these movies.

383
00:35:57,991 --> 00:36:01,078
I didn't know you'd feel that way
about this movie.

384
00:36:01,161 --> 00:36:04,248
- I don't know much about movies...
- This the only kind you go to?

385
00:36:04,331 --> 00:36:07,251
Yeah, I come. This is not so bad.

386
00:36:07,376 --> 00:36:11,421
Taking me to this place is about
as exciting as you saying, "Let's fuck."

387
00:36:15,676 --> 00:36:19,012
There are other places,
plenty of other movies I can take you to.

388
00:36:19,096 --> 00:36:22,140
I don't know much about them,
but I can take you to other places.

389
00:36:22,224 --> 00:36:23,725
We're just different.

390
00:36:24,142 --> 00:36:26,520
- Wait a second.
- I have to go.

391
00:36:26,854 --> 00:36:29,815
- I've got to go now.
- I wanna talk to you.

392
00:36:29,898 --> 00:36:31,817
- I have to go.
- Wait a second.

393
00:36:32,234 --> 00:36:33,318
Taxi!

394
00:36:33,569 --> 00:36:37,364
Can't I talk to you at least?
Won't you talk to me? I didn't know...

395
00:36:38,115 --> 00:36:40,826
- Look, won't you take the record?
- I've already got it.

396
00:36:40,909 --> 00:36:43,704
But, please. I bought it for you, Betsy.

397
00:36:43,745 --> 00:36:45,914
Thanks. Now I've got two. Let's go.

398
00:36:46,248 --> 00:36:47,541
Can I call you?

399
00:36:49,209 --> 00:36:51,003
Jesus Christ. I got a taxi.

400
00:36:57,259 --> 00:36:59,761
Hello, Betsy. Hi, it's Travis.

401
00:37:02,598 --> 00:37:06,018
How you doing?
Listen, I'm sorry about the other night.

402
00:37:06,101 --> 00:37:08,604
I didn't know that's how you felt about it.

403
00:37:11,356 --> 00:37:15,611
I didn't know that was the way you felt.
I would've taken you somewhere else.

404
00:37:17,029 --> 00:37:18,947
Are you feeling better or...

405
00:37:19,948 --> 00:37:23,327
Maybe you had a virus or something,
24-hour virus.

406
00:37:23,869 --> 00:37:25,370
It can happen. Yeah.

407
00:37:31,126 --> 00:37:33,837
You've been working hard.
I know it's... Yeah...

408
00:37:34,463 --> 00:37:35,506
Okay.

409
00:37:37,508 --> 00:37:40,219
Would you like to have
some dinner with me...

410
00:37:41,136 --> 00:37:43,263
in the next few days or something?

411
00:37:46,683 --> 00:37:48,519
How about just a cup of coffee?

412
00:37:48,602 --> 00:37:51,522
I could come by the headquarters.
We could...

413
00:37:53,857 --> 00:37:55,025
Okay.

414
00:37:58,028 --> 00:38:00,155
Did you get my flowers in the...

415
00:38:02,658 --> 00:38:05,827
You didn't get them? I sent some flowers...

416
00:38:10,666 --> 00:38:13,460
Yeah, okay.

417
00:38:13,502 --> 00:38:16,922
Can I call you again tomorrow
or the next day?

418
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:20,968
Okay. No, I'm gonna... Yeah, sure, okay.

419
00:38:21,844 --> 00:38:22,928
So long.

420
00:38:25,514 --> 00:38:28,559
<i>I tried several times to call her,</i>
<i>but after the first call...</i>

421
00:38:28,642 --> 00:38:31,103
<i>she wouldn't come to the phone any longer.</i>

422
00:38:31,895 --> 00:38:34,189
<i>I also sent flowers, but with no luck.</i>

423
00:38:34,565 --> 00:38:37,150
<i>The smell of the flowers</i>
<i>only made me sicker.</i>

424
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:40,779
<i>The headaches got worse.</i>
<i>I think I got stomach cancer.</i>

425
00:38:42,489 --> 00:38:44,366
<i>I shouldn't complain, though.</i>

426
00:38:45,075 --> 00:38:46,827
<i>You're only as healthy...</i>

427
00:38:47,953 --> 00:38:50,122
<i>You're only as healthy as you feel.</i>

428
00:38:51,707 --> 00:38:54,376
<i>You're only as healthy...</i>

429
00:38:55,335 --> 00:38:59,173
<i>as you feel.</i>

430
00:39:06,054 --> 00:39:07,514
Thank you very much.

431
00:39:10,475 --> 00:39:12,144
Let's not have any trouble, okay?

432
00:39:12,227 --> 00:39:15,689
What? Why won't you talk to me,
or answer my calls when I call?

433
00:39:15,772 --> 00:39:18,609
- You think I don't know you're here?
- Let's not have trouble.

434
00:39:18,692 --> 00:39:20,360
- Please leave.
- Get your hands off me.

435
00:39:20,444 --> 00:39:22,362
- Okay, then leave.
- Know that I know.

436
00:39:22,446 --> 00:39:25,991
Let's not have any trouble. Please.
This is no place to do this.

437
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:28,785
- Get your hands off me!
- Okay, just leave.

438
00:39:28,869 --> 00:39:31,747
- Take them off!
- All right! Just leave now. Come on.

439
00:39:32,206 --> 00:39:35,792
You're in a hell, and you're gonna die
in a hell like the rest of them!

440
00:39:35,876 --> 00:39:38,378
- There's a cop across the street.
- You're like them.

441
00:39:38,462 --> 00:39:40,422
I'm calling the cop. Officer!

442
00:39:46,678 --> 00:39:49,890
Look. Don't come around here
because I'll call the police!

443
00:39:50,974 --> 00:39:54,311
<i>I realize now how much</i>
<i>she's just like the others.</i>

444
00:39:54,436 --> 00:39:57,731
<i>Cold and distant.</i>
<i>And many people are like that.</i>

445
00:39:58,106 --> 00:40:00,901
<i>Women for sure. They're like a union.</i>

446
00:40:02,653 --> 00:40:03,695
Cab!

447
00:40:11,954 --> 00:40:15,082
Pull over to the curb over there.

448
00:40:17,876 --> 00:40:19,711
No, don't...

449
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:22,714
The fucking meter. What are you doing?

450
00:40:22,798 --> 00:40:24,758
What are you doing with the meter?

451
00:40:24,842 --> 00:40:27,594
Did I tell you to do that with the meter?

452
00:40:28,303 --> 00:40:30,806
Put the meter back, let the numbers go on.

453
00:40:30,848 --> 00:40:33,809
I don't care what I have to pay.
I'm not getting out.

454
00:40:33,976 --> 00:40:35,602
Put the meter back on.

455
00:40:36,186 --> 00:40:37,354
Put it down.

456
00:40:38,689 --> 00:40:40,983
That's right. Put it down.

457
00:40:45,654 --> 00:40:47,114
Why are you writing?

458
00:40:47,322 --> 00:40:50,117
Don't write! Put the thing down. Just sit.

459
00:40:53,328 --> 00:40:56,582
I didn't tell you to write.
I just said, "Pull over to the curb."

460
00:40:56,665 --> 00:40:59,626
We've pulled over to the curb.
We're gonna sit here.

461
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:02,546
We're gonna sit.

462
00:41:21,356 --> 00:41:24,735
Cabbie, you see that light up there?
The window?

463
00:41:26,945 --> 00:41:29,823
The light, the window
up there on the second floor.

464
00:41:32,576 --> 00:41:35,454
The one that's closest
to the edge of the building.

465
00:41:36,955 --> 00:41:39,625
The light up in the window, second story.

466
00:41:42,085 --> 00:41:43,879
What, are you blind?

467
00:41:43,962 --> 00:41:45,464
Do you see the light?

468
00:41:46,548 --> 00:41:48,592
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you see it. Good.

469
00:41:51,637 --> 00:41:53,472
See the woman in the window?

470
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:57,809
Do you see the woman in the window?

471
00:42:00,145 --> 00:42:01,146
Yeah.

472
00:42:01,396 --> 00:42:03,065
You see the woman. Good.

473
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,360
I want you to see that woman
because that's my wife.

474
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:10,656
But that's not my apartment.

475
00:42:13,575 --> 00:42:16,328
It's not my apartment.
You know who lives there?

476
00:42:17,412 --> 00:42:21,500
You wouldn't know. I'm just saying...
But you know who lives there?

477
00:42:22,251 --> 00:42:24,753
A nigger lives there. How do you like that?

478
00:42:33,053 --> 00:42:34,513
I'm gonna kill her.

479
00:42:37,516 --> 00:42:41,937
There's nothing else. I'm just gonna kill her.
What do you think of that?

480
00:42:44,147 --> 00:42:46,275
I said, what do you think of that?

481
00:42:46,942 --> 00:42:48,193
Don't answer.

482
00:42:48,652 --> 00:42:50,863
You don't have to answer everything.

483
00:42:54,825 --> 00:42:57,369
I'm gonna kill her with a.44 magnum pistol.

484
00:42:58,412 --> 00:43:01,874
I have a.44 magnum pistol.
I'm gonna kill her with that gun.

485
00:43:02,958 --> 00:43:06,753
Did you ever see what a.44 magnum
would do to a woman's face?

486
00:43:07,087 --> 00:43:09,923
It'll fucking destroy it.
Just blow it right apart.

487
00:43:10,799 --> 00:43:12,926
That's what it can do to her face.

488
00:43:13,343 --> 00:43:17,014
Did you see what it can do
to a woman's pussy? That you should see.

489
00:43:17,973 --> 00:43:21,351
You should see what a.44 magnum's
gonna do to a woman's pussy.

490
00:43:28,817 --> 00:43:29,943
What's that?

491
00:43:30,277 --> 00:43:32,237
I know you must think I'm...

492
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,158
You must think I'm pretty sick or something.

493
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:39,995
Right? You think I'm pretty sick?

494
00:43:44,625 --> 00:43:46,960
Right? I bet you really think I'm sick.

495
00:43:47,503 --> 00:43:48,962
You think I'm sick?

496
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:03,018
You don't have to answer that.
I'm paying for the ride.

497
00:44:05,187 --> 00:44:08,315
I picked up this midget.
He was very well dressed.

498
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:12,611
Italian suit. Good-looking.
Had a beautiful tall blonde.

499
00:44:12,694 --> 00:44:13,946
A lady midget?

500
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:16,823
No, the guy was a midget.
The blonde was the lady.

501
00:44:16,907 --> 00:44:19,576
- I got it.
- Those midgets are funny.

502
00:44:21,537 --> 00:44:23,664
- Sometimes I like to hold a midget.
- Yeah?

503
00:44:23,705 --> 00:44:26,875
They're funny. They always want
to sit in the front seat.

504
00:44:28,377 --> 00:44:31,839
Then I pick up these two fags.
They're going downtown.

505
00:44:34,049 --> 00:44:37,594
They're wearing these rhinestone t-shirts.
They start arguing.

506
00:44:37,678 --> 00:44:39,805
They start yelling.
The other says, "You bitch!"

507
00:44:39,888 --> 00:44:41,598
And starts beating him on the head.

508
00:44:41,682 --> 00:44:45,352
I say, "Look, I don't care what you do
in the privacy of your own home...

509
00:44:45,435 --> 00:44:46,687
"behind closed doors.

510
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:50,649
"This is an American free country.
We've got a pursuit of happiness thing.

511
00:44:50,732 --> 00:44:52,776
"You're consenting. You're adult.

512
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:56,363
"But in my fucking cab...

513
00:44:56,572 --> 00:44:58,782
"don't go busting heads."
You know what I mean?

514
00:44:58,866 --> 00:45:00,492
"God loves you. Do what you want."

515
00:45:00,576 --> 00:45:01,910
Tell them to go to California.

516
00:45:01,994 --> 00:45:06,123
In California, when two fags split up,
one's got to pay the other alimony.

517
00:45:08,375 --> 00:45:12,212
Not bad. They're way ahead out there.
You know what I mean? California.

518
00:45:13,046 --> 00:45:15,257
I tell them to get out of the fucking cab.

519
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:19,219
One time I saw a cop chasing this guy
with one leg. He was on crutches.

520
00:45:20,095 --> 00:45:21,096
The cop?

521
00:45:21,346 --> 00:45:24,975
No, the dude that he was chasing.
Fucking cops, they chase anything.

522
00:45:25,058 --> 00:45:27,519
Hey, Travis. You got that five you owe me?

523
00:45:30,189 --> 00:45:33,192
The man is loaded.

524
00:45:34,401 --> 00:45:38,488
I'd be broke tonight if I hadn't caught me
some people from Ohio at Kennedy.

525
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:42,492
I took them into Manhattan by way
of Long Beach. Tipped me $5.

526
00:45:43,285 --> 00:45:44,995
Where's the action around?

527
00:45:45,954 --> 00:45:47,331
It's pretty slow.

528
00:45:48,332 --> 00:45:49,625
I'm shoving on.

529
00:45:50,792 --> 00:45:52,252
Wait.

530
00:45:52,961 --> 00:45:54,922
Can I talk to you for a second?

531
00:45:55,047 --> 00:45:56,173
Bye, killer.

532
00:45:59,801 --> 00:46:00,969
Ninety-nine.

533
00:46:17,486 --> 00:46:19,238
You can have all you want.

534
00:46:19,488 --> 00:46:21,448
Don't be hitting on me!

535
00:46:22,866 --> 00:46:24,993
You better take your ass out, boy!

536
00:46:31,166 --> 00:46:33,836
- Yeah?
- I know you and I ain't talked too much.

537
00:46:34,837 --> 00:46:37,798
But I figured you've been around a lot.
So you could...

538
00:46:37,881 --> 00:46:40,425
Shoot, that's why they call me the "Wizard."

539
00:46:42,594 --> 00:46:44,304
It's just that I got a...

540
00:46:45,347 --> 00:46:47,975
- I got a...
- Things got you down?

541
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:50,936
- Yeah.
- It happens to the best of us.

542
00:46:52,271 --> 00:46:54,189
Yeah, it got me real down.

543
00:47:00,529 --> 00:47:05,284
I just want to go out
and really do something.

544
00:47:08,412 --> 00:47:09,913
Taxi life, you mean?

545
00:47:11,874 --> 00:47:13,333
Yeah, well...

546
00:47:14,209 --> 00:47:15,460
No, it's...

547
00:47:17,254 --> 00:47:18,505
I don't know.

548
00:47:20,757 --> 00:47:22,301
I just wanna go out...

549
00:47:23,677 --> 00:47:24,970
and really...

550
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,015
I really wanna...

551
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:31,018
I got some bad ideas in my head. I just...

552
00:47:33,687 --> 00:47:35,439
Look at it this way.

553
00:47:36,899 --> 00:47:39,818
A man takes a job, you know.

554
00:47:41,278 --> 00:47:42,654
And that job...

555
00:47:43,113 --> 00:47:44,615
I mean, like that...

556
00:47:45,073 --> 00:47:46,783
That becomes what he is.

557
00:47:47,784 --> 00:47:48,869
Like...

558
00:47:51,246 --> 00:47:53,290
you do a thing and that's what you are.

559
00:47:53,373 --> 00:47:56,877
Like, I've been a cabbie for 17 years.

560
00:47:57,544 --> 00:47:58,962
Ten years at night.

561
00:47:59,046 --> 00:48:01,507
I still don't own my own cab.
You know why?

562
00:48:02,674 --> 00:48:05,969
Because I don't want to.
That must be what I want.

563
00:48:07,054 --> 00:48:10,015
To be on the night shift
driving somebody else's cab.

564
00:48:10,432 --> 00:48:11,725
You understand?

565
00:48:12,059 --> 00:48:15,521
I mean, you get a job, you become the job.

566
00:48:16,271 --> 00:48:19,900
One guy lives in Brooklyn.
One guy lives in Sutton Place.

567
00:48:19,983 --> 00:48:22,486
You got a lawyer. Another guy's a doctor.

568
00:48:22,778 --> 00:48:25,239
Another guy dies. Another guy gets well.

569
00:48:26,114 --> 00:48:27,491
People are born.

570
00:48:27,908 --> 00:48:29,535
I envy you, your youth.

571
00:48:31,411 --> 00:48:32,746
Go on, get laid.

572
00:48:33,038 --> 00:48:34,748
Get drunk. Do anything.

573
00:48:37,501 --> 00:48:40,796
Because you got no choice, anyway.
I mean, we're all fucked.

574
00:48:42,214 --> 00:48:43,423
More or less.

575
00:48:48,303 --> 00:48:51,557
I don't know. That's about
the dumbest thing I ever heard.

576
00:48:54,142 --> 00:48:57,145
It's not Bertrand Russell.
What do you want? I'm a cabbie.

577
00:48:57,229 --> 00:48:58,647
What do I know?

578
00:48:58,814 --> 00:49:01,608
I don't even know
what the fuck you're talking about.

579
00:49:01,692 --> 00:49:03,443
Maybe I don't know either.

580
00:49:05,445 --> 00:49:07,114
Don't worry so much.

581
00:49:07,906 --> 00:49:10,242
Relax, killer. You're gonna be all right.

582
00:49:10,325 --> 00:49:12,786
I know. I've seen a lot of people, and...

583
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:15,372
- I know.
- Okay.

584
00:49:16,999 --> 00:49:18,125
Thanks, man.

585
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,086
I guess...

586
00:49:23,881 --> 00:49:26,008
Yeah, you're all right.

587
00:49:45,194 --> 00:49:49,364
<i>What do you think of your opponent's</i>
<i>chances in the up and coming primary?</i>

588
00:49:49,907 --> 00:49:51,617
<i>Mr. Goodwin is a fine man.</i>

589
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:54,995
<i>I would certainly,</i>
<i>if it came to it, prefer him...</i>

590
00:49:55,370 --> 00:49:57,873
<i>to our opponent in the other party.</i>

591
00:49:57,956 --> 00:50:01,543
<i>I think that my programs</i>
<i>are better defined than his.</i>

592
00:50:01,877 --> 00:50:05,547
<i>They're more imaginative,</i>
<i>and I have a better chance of winning.</i>

593
00:50:05,714 --> 00:50:09,760
<i>I think it's academic, though, because</i>
<i>he's not gonna win the primary. I am.</i>

594
00:50:11,178 --> 00:50:14,348
<i>One more thing I'd like to ask,</i>
<i>and that's about your campaign.</i>

595
00:50:14,389 --> 00:50:16,683
<i>How do you feel your campaign's going?</i>

596
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:20,062
<i>When we came up with our slogan,</i>
<i>"We are the people"...</i>

597
00:50:20,145 --> 00:50:22,397
<i>when I said, "Let the people rule"...</i>

598
00:50:23,232 --> 00:50:25,692
<i>I felt I was being</i>
<i>somewhat overly optimistic.</i>

599
00:50:25,776 --> 00:50:29,530
<i>I must tell you that I'm more optimistic</i>
<i>now than ever before.</i>

600
00:50:29,571 --> 00:50:33,200
<i>The people are rising to the demands</i>
<i>that I have made on them.</i>

601
00:50:33,659 --> 00:50:36,203
<i>The people are beginning to rule.</i>

602
00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:38,205
<i>I feel it as the crowds swell.</i>

603
00:50:38,288 --> 00:50:42,417
<i>I know it will continue through the primary,</i>
<i>it will continue in Miami...</i>

604
00:50:42,543 --> 00:50:47,422
<i>and I know it will rise</i>
<i>to an unprecedented swell in November.</i>

605
00:52:14,843 --> 00:52:18,472
Bitch, goddamn! I'll blow her face off!
I'll kill her, god damn it!

606
00:52:18,555 --> 00:52:22,559
Damn! If I get my hands on her,
I'll kill her! Goddamn motherfucker!

607
00:52:22,726 --> 00:52:25,479
I swear I'll kill that fucking bitch!

608
00:52:26,146 --> 00:52:28,190
If I get my hands on her, I'll kill her!

609
00:52:28,273 --> 00:52:29,441
Hey, Sport.

610
00:52:29,942 --> 00:52:32,069
I'll kill her! Damn it!

611
00:52:32,194 --> 00:52:34,655
- This guy keeps following.
- Don't look at him.

612
00:52:51,463 --> 00:52:52,840
Hey, guys.

613
00:52:55,843 --> 00:52:57,761
- You wanna take a walk?
- Yeah.

614
00:53:10,566 --> 00:53:13,735
<i>Loneliness has followed me</i>
<i>my whole life, everywhere.</i>

615
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:16,238
<i>In bars, in cars.</i>

616
00:53:17,239 --> 00:53:19,950
<i>Sidewalks, stores, everywhere.</i>

617
00:53:20,951 --> 00:53:22,369
<i>There's no escape.</i>

618
00:53:22,953 --> 00:53:24,580
<i>I'm God's lonely man.</i>

619
00:53:29,334 --> 00:53:30,836
<i>June 8.</i>

620
00:53:31,461 --> 00:53:33,714
<i>My life has taken another turn again.</i>

621
00:53:34,173 --> 00:53:37,217
<i>The days move along with regularity,</i>
<i>over and over.</i>

622
00:53:37,801 --> 00:53:40,220
<i>One day indistinguishable from the next.</i>

623
00:53:40,637 --> 00:53:42,639
<i>A long continuous chain.</i>

624
00:53:43,307 --> 00:53:44,683
<i>Then suddenly...</i>

625
00:53:45,350 --> 00:53:46,768
<i>there is change.</i>

626
00:54:02,117 --> 00:54:05,037
Hey, Travis, this here's Easy Andy.
He's a traveling salesman.

627
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:06,705
How you doing, Travis?

628
00:54:29,937 --> 00:54:32,773
- You got a.44 magnum?
- It's an expensive weapon.

629
00:54:32,856 --> 00:54:34,775
That's all right. I got money.

630
00:54:35,025 --> 00:54:36,527
It's a real monster.

631
00:54:37,736 --> 00:54:41,949
It will stop a car at 100 yards.
Put a round right through the engine block.

632
00:54:52,835 --> 00:54:53,961
Here you go.

633
00:54:54,837 --> 00:54:57,005
It's a premium, high-resale weapon.

634
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:02,970
Look at that.

635
00:55:04,555 --> 00:55:05,931
That's a beauty.

636
00:55:11,228 --> 00:55:14,606
I could sell this gun
to some jungle bunny in Harlem for $500.

637
00:55:15,649 --> 00:55:18,485
But I deal high quality goods
to the right people.

638
00:55:20,195 --> 00:55:21,488
How about that?

639
00:55:22,406 --> 00:55:25,075
This might be a little too big
for practical purposes.

640
00:55:25,158 --> 00:55:27,494
In which case for you, I'd recommend...

641
00:55:28,412 --> 00:55:29,746
.38 snub-nose.

642
00:55:31,582 --> 00:55:32,833
Look at this.

643
00:55:35,335 --> 00:55:37,713
Look at that. That's a beautiful little gun.

644
00:55:37,796 --> 00:55:39,715
It's nickel-plated, snub-nose.

645
00:55:40,424 --> 00:55:42,843
Otherwise the same as a service revolver.

646
00:55:42,885 --> 00:55:44,970
That'll stop anything that moves.

647
00:55:45,387 --> 00:55:48,515
A magnum, they use that in Africa
for killing elephants.

648
00:55:49,099 --> 00:55:51,268
That.38, that's a fine gun.

649
00:55:57,274 --> 00:55:59,359
Some of these guns are like toys.

650
00:55:59,693 --> 00:56:00,777
That.38...

651
00:56:01,111 --> 00:56:03,113
you go and hammer nails with it all day...

652
00:56:03,197 --> 00:56:06,450
come back and it'll cut dead center
on target every time.

653
00:56:06,742 --> 00:56:10,037
It's got a really nice action to it
and a heck of a wallop.

654
00:56:13,123 --> 00:56:15,125
You interested in an automatic?

655
00:56:15,751 --> 00:56:18,629
It's a colt.25 automatic. It's a nice little gun.

656
00:56:19,546 --> 00:56:23,675
It's a beautiful little gun. Holds six shots
in the clip, one shot in the chamber.

657
00:56:23,759 --> 00:56:26,637
That's if you're dumb enough
to put a round in the chamber.

658
00:56:27,346 --> 00:56:30,807
Here, look at this. A.380 Walther.

659
00:56:31,683 --> 00:56:33,602
Holds eight shots in the clip.

660
00:56:35,062 --> 00:56:36,438
That's a nice gun.

661
00:56:37,147 --> 00:56:39,691
That's a beautiful little gun. Look at that.

662
00:56:43,111 --> 00:56:46,532
During World War II,
they used this gun to replace the P-38.

663
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,993
Just given out to officers.

664
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:57,960
Isn't that a little honey?

665
00:57:07,261 --> 00:57:09,972
- How much for everything?
- All together.

666
00:57:10,597 --> 00:57:14,393
Only a jackass would carry that cannon
in the streets like that. Here.

667
00:57:15,310 --> 00:57:18,772
Here's a beautiful handmade holster
I had made in Mexico.

668
00:57:19,189 --> 00:57:20,232
$40.

669
00:57:21,733 --> 00:57:24,736
$350 for the magnum, $250 for the.38...

670
00:57:25,028 --> 00:57:28,657
$125 for the.25, $150 for the.380.

671
00:57:28,991 --> 00:57:31,952
You take this and wait here.
I'll walk down with you.

672
00:57:32,870 --> 00:57:35,831
How about dope? Grass, hash, coke...

673
00:57:35,998 --> 00:57:39,585
mescaline, downers, Nembutal,
toluol, chloral hydrates?

674
00:57:40,085 --> 00:57:43,755
- How about uppers, amphetamines?
- I'm not interested in that stuff.

675
00:57:43,881 --> 00:57:46,425
I can get you crystal meth, nitrous oxide.

676
00:57:46,884 --> 00:57:50,971
I can get you a brand-new Cadillac
with a pink slip for $2,000.

677
00:57:59,897 --> 00:58:01,023
<i>June 29.</i>

678
00:58:02,482 --> 00:58:05,444
<i>I got to get in shape now.</i>
<i>Too much sitting has ruined my body.</i>

679
00:58:05,527 --> 00:58:07,905
<i>Too much abuse has gone on for too long.</i>

680
00:58:08,363 --> 00:58:12,701
<i>From now on it'll be 50 pushups</i>
<i>each morning, 50 pull-ups.</i>

681
00:58:12,951 --> 00:58:17,664
<i>There will be no more pills, no more</i>
<i>bad food, no more destroyers of my body.</i>

682
00:58:19,082 --> 00:58:22,836
<i>From now on it'll be total organization.</i>
<i>Every muscle must be tight.</i>

683
00:58:40,145 --> 00:58:43,941
<i>Look at the size of that. Oh, yeah.</i>

684
00:58:45,108 --> 00:58:46,568
<i>It looks so good.</i>

685
00:58:52,574 --> 00:58:56,161
<i>It's getting harder and harder.</i>
<i>It's throbbing now.</i>

686
00:58:58,497 --> 00:59:01,583
<i>The idea had been growing in my brain</i>
<i>for some time.</i>

687
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:08,924
<i>True force. All the king's men</i>
<i>cannot put it back together again.</i>

688
01:01:10,546 --> 01:01:11,755
Where do get more of these?

689
01:01:11,839 --> 01:01:14,591
Where do you think?
Back at the headquarters.

690
01:01:14,675 --> 01:01:16,510
Go all the way back there to get to town.

691
01:01:16,718 --> 01:01:18,345
- Come on.
- All right. It'll work.

692
01:01:18,428 --> 01:01:21,265
- Maybe it's the speakers.
- It's not. I've done this 100 times.

693
01:01:21,348 --> 01:01:23,559
- You've done this before?
- Yes. Don't worry.

694
01:01:23,642 --> 01:01:26,562
- When was the last time?
- I've never done this before.

695
01:01:26,728 --> 01:01:27,771
Betsy?

696
01:01:30,023 --> 01:01:31,024
What?

697
01:01:31,525 --> 01:01:33,694
Betsy. Come here.

698
01:02:32,753 --> 01:02:35,130
You're a Secret Service man, aren't you?

699
01:02:37,466 --> 01:02:39,343
Just waiting for the Senator.

700
01:02:40,385 --> 01:02:42,387
You're waiting for the Senator?

701
01:02:46,391 --> 01:02:48,101
That's a very good answer.

702
01:02:48,977 --> 01:02:50,062
Shit, man.

703
01:02:51,980 --> 01:02:54,066
I'm waiting for the sun to shine.

704
01:02:54,149 --> 01:02:55,192
Yeah.

705
01:02:56,068 --> 01:02:59,988
No. The reason I asked
if you were a Secret Service man...

706
01:03:00,072 --> 01:03:02,574
I won't say anything, because I...

707
01:03:07,329 --> 01:03:09,831
I saw some suspicious looking people
over there.

708
01:03:09,915 --> 01:03:12,167
- You did?
- They were right over there.

709
01:03:17,756 --> 01:03:19,466
They were just here. I...

710
01:03:23,220 --> 01:03:25,222
They were very, very...

711
01:03:25,597 --> 01:03:27,140
- Suspicious?
- Yeah.

712
01:03:30,352 --> 01:03:31,770
Where'd they go?

713
01:03:33,313 --> 01:03:35,983
Is it hard to get to be in the Secret Service?

714
01:03:36,275 --> 01:03:37,276
Why?

715
01:03:37,401 --> 01:03:40,237
I was just curious,
'cause I think I'd be good at it.

716
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:41,780
I'm very observant.

717
01:03:42,656 --> 01:03:44,366
I was in the Marine Corps.

718
01:03:45,701 --> 01:03:47,202
I'm good with crowds.

719
01:03:49,955 --> 01:03:53,667
I notice there's a little pin there.
That's like a signal, isn't it?

720
01:03:54,168 --> 01:03:55,586
- Sort of.
- Signal.

721
01:03:56,003 --> 01:03:58,380
A secret signal for the Secret Service.

722
01:04:02,509 --> 01:04:04,595
What kind of guns you guys carry?

723
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:08,182
.38s?.45s?.357 magnums?

724
01:04:08,390 --> 01:04:10,017
Something bigger maybe?

725
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:14,313
Look, if you're really interested,
if you give me your name and address...

726
01:04:15,022 --> 01:04:18,483
we'll send you all the information
on how to apply. How's that?

727
01:04:21,028 --> 01:04:22,362
- You will?
- Sure.

728
01:04:22,487 --> 01:04:23,488
Okay.

729
01:04:24,364 --> 01:04:25,365
Why not?

730
01:04:29,369 --> 01:04:30,954
My name is Henry...

731
01:04:32,706 --> 01:04:34,791
Krinkle. K-R-I-N-K-L-E.

732
01:04:38,795 --> 01:04:41,423
154 Hopper Avenue.

733
01:04:43,175 --> 01:04:44,426
- Hopper.
- Yeah.

734
01:04:47,471 --> 01:04:49,473
Like a rabbit. Hip, hop.

735
01:04:53,185 --> 01:04:54,686
Fairlawn, New Jersey.

736
01:04:58,023 --> 01:05:01,235
- Is there a zip code with that, Henry?
- Yeah. 610452.

737
01:05:04,696 --> 01:05:06,573
- Okay.
- That's six digits.

738
01:05:09,326 --> 01:05:11,161
61045.

739
01:05:12,955 --> 01:05:13,956
Okay.

740
01:05:14,998 --> 01:05:17,292
I was thinking of my telephone number.

741
01:05:18,210 --> 01:05:21,797
I've got it all, Henry,
we'll get all the stuff right out to you.

742
01:05:22,548 --> 01:05:25,676
Thanks a lot. Great. Hell. Jesus.

743
01:05:26,218 --> 01:05:28,220
- Be careful today.
- Right. Will do.

744
01:05:28,303 --> 01:05:31,098
You have to be careful
living around a place like this.

745
01:05:31,181 --> 01:05:32,224
Bye.

746
01:05:40,274 --> 01:05:41,233
Damn it.

747
01:06:09,845 --> 01:06:12,347
Faster than you, you fucking son of a...

748
01:06:13,432 --> 01:06:17,144
I saw you coming, you fucking shit-heel.

749
01:06:21,565 --> 01:06:23,817
I'm standing here. You make the move.

750
01:06:26,570 --> 01:06:27,863
It's your move.

751
01:06:31,408 --> 01:06:33,035
Don't try it, you fuck.

752
01:06:40,042 --> 01:06:41,460
You talking to me?

753
01:06:52,095 --> 01:06:55,516
Then who the hell else are you talking to?
You talking to me?

754
01:06:56,016 --> 01:06:57,601
I'm the only one here.

755
01:06:59,853 --> 01:07:02,397
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?

756
01:07:03,524 --> 01:07:04,525
Oh, yeah?

757
01:07:07,361 --> 01:07:08,362
Okay.

758
01:07:16,078 --> 01:07:18,539
<i>Listen, you fuckers, you screw-heads.</i>

759
01:07:18,747 --> 01:07:21,375
<i>Here is a man</i>
<i>who would not take it anymore.</i>

760
01:07:21,625 --> 01:07:23,335
<i>Who would not let...</i>

761
01:07:23,919 --> 01:07:27,005
<i>Listen, you fuckers, you screw-heads.</i>

762
01:07:27,381 --> 01:07:30,634
<i>Here is a man</i>
<i>who would not take it anymore.</i>

763
01:07:30,717 --> 01:07:35,514
<i>A man who stood up against the scum,</i>
<i>the cunts, the dogs, the filth, the shit.</i>

764
01:07:35,556 --> 01:07:37,432
<i>Here is someone who stood up.</i>

765
01:07:39,518 --> 01:07:40,602
<i>Here is...</i>

766
01:07:45,899 --> 01:07:47,067
You're dead.

767
01:08:28,692 --> 01:08:29,776
Yeah, man?

768
01:08:29,902 --> 01:08:33,363
Shut your mouth. Give me the cash
out of the drawer. Come on.

769
01:08:34,364 --> 01:08:35,949
Let's go. Give me the goddamn cash.

770
01:08:36,033 --> 01:08:39,328
- Don't shoot. I'm getting it.
- Stop taking so long. Come on.

771
01:08:39,745 --> 01:08:41,955
Let me have it. Give me the bread.

772
01:08:42,372 --> 01:08:44,333
- This all you got? Get the rest.
- That's it.

773
01:08:44,416 --> 01:08:46,919
- I don't have any more.
- Give me the rest of the cash.

774
01:08:47,002 --> 01:08:48,670
- That's all I got.
- Give me more.

775
01:08:48,754 --> 01:08:51,423
- I got no money.
- Reach in your sock. You got more bread.

776
01:08:51,507 --> 01:08:54,676
- That's it, man.
- Give me the rest of the fucking bread.

777
01:08:59,515 --> 01:09:01,934
- Did you get him?
- Yeah, I got him.

778
01:09:06,647 --> 01:09:08,273
Shit, man.

779
01:09:10,943 --> 01:09:14,029
- Is he dead?
- I don't know. His eyes are moving.

780
01:09:19,701 --> 01:09:23,997
Listen, I ain't got a permit for this thing.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

781
01:09:27,709 --> 01:09:29,795
Don't worry about it. I'll take care of it.

782
01:09:29,837 --> 01:09:32,339
- Can I give you some money?
- No. Just get out of here.

783
01:09:32,381 --> 01:09:34,800
No, man. I'll take care of it. Go ahead.

784
01:09:39,012 --> 01:09:43,058
That's the fifth motherfucker this year.
You wanna buy that little dope?

785
01:11:27,496 --> 01:11:30,332
<i>Walt Whitman, that great American poet...</i>

786
01:11:30,624 --> 01:11:32,668
<i>spoke for all of us when he said:</i>

787
01:11:32,751 --> 01:11:36,964
<i>"I am the man. I suffered. I was there."</i>

788
01:11:37,297 --> 01:11:40,676
<i>Today I say to you, we are the people.</i>

789
01:11:41,385 --> 01:11:44,054
<i>We suffered. We were there.</i>

790
01:11:47,266 --> 01:11:50,060
<i>We, the people, suffered in Vietnam.</i>

791
01:11:51,186 --> 01:11:55,482
<i>We, the people, suffered,</i>
<i>we still suffer from unemployment...</i>

792
01:11:55,774 --> 01:11:59,194
<i>inflation, crime and corruption.</i>

803
01:12:33,103 --> 01:12:34,813

Come on, let's go. Move it.

811

821
01:13:36,917 --> 01:13:40,379

<i>Our marriage?</i>

828
01:14:14,288 --> 01:14:16,623
<i>You've got to know</i>
<i>that our marriage wasn't legal.</i>

829
01:14:16,665 --> 01:14:18,834
<i>In the eyes of God, we are married.</i>

830
01:14:21,962 --> 01:14:26,133
<i>Brock, please don't do this to me.</i>

831

<i>I love him...</i>

832
01:14:38,896 --> 01:14:39,980
Damn!

833
01:14:41,940 --> 01:14:43,150
Goddamn!

834
01:15:18,685 --> 01:15:21,021
Are you trying to get rid of me?

835
01:15:24,775 --> 01:15:27,277
- You looking for some action?
- Yeah.

836
01:15:30,614 --> 01:15:33,367
- You see that guy over there?
- Yeah.

837
01:15:33,408 --> 01:15:36,495
All right. You go talk to him.
His name is Matthew.

838
01:15:36,537 --> 01:15:39,373
- I'll be over there waiting for you.
- Okay.

839
01:15:43,710 --> 01:15:46,964
Is your name Matthew? I want some action.

840
01:15:47,548 --> 01:15:48,924
Officer...

841
01:15:50,175 --> 01:15:53,887
I swear I'm clean.
I'm just waiting here for a friend.

842
01:15:54,179 --> 01:15:56,598
You gonna bust me for nothing, man?

843
01:15:56,765 --> 01:15:58,308
I'm not a cop.

844
01:15:59,142 --> 01:16:02,104
- I ain't no cop.
- Then why ask me for action?

845
01:16:04,147 --> 01:16:06,149
Because she sent me over.

846
01:16:08,569 --> 01:16:11,405
I suppose that ain't a.38
you got in your sock.

847
01:16:11,446 --> 01:16:13,574
.38? No.

848
01:16:14,783 --> 01:16:16,326
I'm clean, man.

849
01:16:17,619 --> 01:16:20,205
- Shit. You're a real cowboy?
- Yeah.

850
01:16:20,664 --> 01:16:22,082
That's nice.

851
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:27,754
It's all right.
$15, 15 minutes. $25, half an hour.

852
01:16:29,548 --> 01:16:30,632
Shit.

853
01:16:31,592 --> 01:16:32,968
Cowboy, huh?

854
01:16:34,511 --> 01:16:38,557
I once had a horse in Coney Island.
She got hit by a car.

855
01:16:41,310 --> 01:16:43,103
Take it or leave it.

856
01:16:43,312 --> 01:16:46,648
If you wanna save yourself some money,
don't fuck her.

857
01:16:46,732 --> 01:16:48,609
'Cause you'll be back every night
for more.

858
01:16:48,692 --> 01:16:52,863
She's twelve-and-a-half years old.
You ain't never had no pussy like that.

859
01:16:53,322 --> 01:16:54,865
You can do anything with her...

860
01:16:54,948 --> 01:16:58,660
come on her, fuck her in the mouth,
fuck her in the ass, come on her face.

861
01:16:58,744 --> 01:17:01,747
She'll get your cock so hard,
she'll make it explode.

862
01:17:04,166 --> 01:17:06,627
But no rough stuff. All right?

863
01:17:12,299 --> 01:17:14,259
All right, I'll take it.

864
01:17:14,468 --> 01:17:17,137
Hey, man! Take out no money over here.

865
01:17:18,138 --> 01:17:19,389
You gonna fuck me?

866
01:17:19,473 --> 01:17:22,518
You're gonna fuck her.
You give her the money.

867
01:17:24,061 --> 01:17:26,021
Catch you later, copper.

868
01:17:26,939 --> 01:17:29,733
- What did you say?
- See you later, copper.

869
01:17:31,527 --> 01:17:33,111
I'm no cop, man.

870
01:17:34,321 --> 01:17:36,865
If you are, it's entrapment already.

871
01:17:40,827 --> 01:17:42,037
I'm hip.

872
01:17:42,955 --> 01:17:44,957
Buddy, you don't look hip.

873
01:17:48,877 --> 01:17:51,421
Go ahead, have yourself a good time.

874
01:18:00,389 --> 01:18:02,140
You're a funny guy.

875
01:18:05,352 --> 01:18:07,479
But looks aren't everything.

876
01:18:07,896 --> 01:18:09,982
Go ahead, have a good time.

877
01:18:15,153 --> 01:18:16,864
You're a funny guy.

878
01:18:59,156 --> 01:19:01,241
The room will cost you $10.

879
01:19:14,213 --> 01:19:16,006
I'm timing you, too.

880
01:19:35,108 --> 01:19:36,360
Come on.

881
01:19:46,203 --> 01:19:48,622
Are you really twelve-and-a-half?

882
01:19:50,207 --> 01:19:53,919
Listen, mister, it's your time.
Fifteen minutes ain't long.

883
01:19:56,505 --> 01:19:59,591
When that cigarette burns out,
your time is up.

884
01:20:03,762 --> 01:20:05,347
How old are you?

885
01:20:07,266 --> 01:20:09,226
You don't want to tell me?

886
01:20:09,351 --> 01:20:12,145
- What's your name?
- Easy.

887
01:20:12,729 --> 01:20:15,816
- That's not any kind of name.
- It's easy to remember.

888
01:20:15,899 --> 01:20:17,901
But what's your real name?

889
01:20:18,610 --> 01:20:20,112
I don't like my real name.

890
01:20:20,195 --> 01:20:22,072
What's your real name?

891
01:20:26,159 --> 01:20:27,244
Iris.

892
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:30,581
What's wrong with that? That's a nice name.

893
01:20:30,664 --> 01:20:32,541
That's what you think.

894
01:20:39,423 --> 01:20:42,926
No, don't do that. Don't you remember me?

895
01:20:43,677 --> 01:20:47,139
Remember when you got into a taxi?
It was a checker taxi.

896
01:20:47,222 --> 01:20:51,977
You got in and that guy Matthew came by
and he said he wanted to take you away.

897
01:20:52,186 --> 01:20:53,979
He pulled you away.

898
01:20:55,397 --> 01:20:57,441
No, I don't remember that.

899
01:20:58,233 --> 01:21:00,777
- You don't remember any of that?
- No.

900
01:21:02,154 --> 01:21:04,489
That's all right.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

901
01:21:04,573 --> 01:21:07,910
We better make it or Sport will get mad.
How do you wanna make it?

902
01:21:07,993 --> 01:21:09,953
I don't want to make it. Who's Sport?

903
01:21:10,037 --> 01:21:12,456
That's Matthew. I call him Sport.

904
01:21:17,753 --> 01:21:19,796
Want to make it like this?

905
01:21:25,844 --> 01:21:29,181
Listen, I...
Can't you understand something?

906
01:21:29,264 --> 01:21:32,809
You're the one who came into my cab.
You wanted to get out of here.

907
01:21:32,893 --> 01:21:34,895
I must have been stoned.

908
01:21:34,978 --> 01:21:36,688
What do you mean? They drug you?

909
01:21:36,730 --> 01:21:38,357
Come off it, man.

910
01:21:39,858 --> 01:21:41,610
What are you doing?

911
01:21:41,985 --> 01:21:43,946
Don't you wanna make it?

912
01:21:47,282 --> 01:21:50,035
No, I don't wanna make it. I wanna help you.

913
01:21:50,327 --> 01:21:52,162
Well, I can help you.

914
01:21:56,542 --> 01:21:59,920
Damn, man! Goddamn it!

915
01:22:04,383 --> 01:22:07,427
Shit, man!
What the hell's the matter with you?

916
01:22:08,637 --> 01:22:10,305
You don't have to make it, mister.

917
01:22:10,389 --> 01:22:13,100
Goddamn it!
Don't you wanna get out of here?

918
01:22:15,060 --> 01:22:17,604
Can't you understand why I came here?

919
01:22:18,188 --> 01:22:20,315
I think I understand.

920
01:22:22,234 --> 01:22:26,572
I tried to get into your cab one night,
and now you wanna take me away.

921
01:22:27,906 --> 01:22:29,199
Is that it?

922
01:22:29,241 --> 01:22:31,577
Yeah, but don't you want to go?

923
01:22:31,743 --> 01:22:33,412
I can leave anytime I want to.

924
01:22:33,495 --> 01:22:35,789
Then what about that one night?

925
01:22:37,666 --> 01:22:39,418
Look, I was stoned.

926
01:22:42,087 --> 01:22:44,214
That's why they stopped me.

927
01:22:46,133 --> 01:22:49,219
When I'm not stoned,
I got no place else to go.

928
01:22:50,429 --> 01:22:54,725
So they just protect me from myself.

929
01:23:00,898 --> 01:23:03,275
No. I don't know.

930
01:23:06,445 --> 01:23:08,572
I don't know. Okay, I tried.

931
01:23:09,615 --> 01:23:11,700
Look, I understand.

932
01:23:12,242 --> 01:23:14,536
And it means something, really.

933
01:23:17,915 --> 01:23:19,750
Look, can I see you again?

934
01:23:19,791 --> 01:23:22,294
- That's not hard to do.
- I don't mean like that.

935
01:23:22,336 --> 01:23:26,298
I mean, you know, regularly.
This is nothing for a person to do.

936
01:23:26,798 --> 01:23:28,926
All right. How about breakfast tomorrow?

937
01:23:28,967 --> 01:23:31,720
- Tomorrow, when?
- I get up at about 1:00.

938
01:23:35,891 --> 01:23:38,101
Well, I got a thing...

939
01:23:38,143 --> 01:23:39,645
Come on, do you want to or not?

940
01:23:39,728 --> 01:23:42,856
Yeah, I want... Okay, all right. 1:00.

941
01:23:44,816 --> 01:23:46,443
See you tomorrow.

942
01:23:47,569 --> 01:23:50,614
Iris, my name is Travis.

943
01:23:51,657 --> 01:23:53,492
Thanks a lot, Travis.

944
01:23:55,577 --> 01:23:58,288
So long, Iris. See you tomorrow.

945
01:24:00,123 --> 01:24:01,500
Sweet Iris.

946
01:24:26,108 --> 01:24:27,609
This is yours.

947
01:24:28,193 --> 01:24:29,736
Spend it right.

948
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:38,662
- Come back anytime, cowboy.
- I will.

949
01:24:57,681 --> 01:25:00,601
Why do you want me
to go back to my parents?

950
01:25:00,934 --> 01:25:04,730
I mean, they hate me.
Why do you think I split in the first place?

951
01:25:04,813 --> 01:25:06,190
There ain't nothing there.

952
01:25:06,273 --> 01:25:09,443
Yeah, but you can't live like this. It's a hell.

953
01:25:09,818 --> 01:25:11,904
A girl should live at home.

954
01:25:12,696 --> 01:25:14,740
Didn't you ever hear of women's lib?

955
01:25:14,823 --> 01:25:16,533
What do you mean, women's lib?

956
01:25:16,617 --> 01:25:19,536
You're a young girl.
You should be home now.

957
01:25:19,703 --> 01:25:23,790
You should be dressed up,
going out with boys, going to school.

958
01:25:23,874 --> 01:25:27,169
- You know, that kind of stuff.
- God, are you square.

959
01:25:27,586 --> 01:25:29,880
Hey, I'm not square.
You're the one that's square.

960
01:25:29,922 --> 01:25:31,882
You're full of shit, man.

961
01:25:31,965 --> 01:25:35,219
What are you talking about?
You walk out with those fucking creeps...

962
01:25:35,302 --> 01:25:40,224
lowlifes and degenerates out on the street
and you sell your little pussy for nothing...

963
01:25:40,682 --> 01:25:44,228
for some lowlife pimp
who stands in a hole?

964
01:25:46,230 --> 01:25:49,191
I'm square?
You're the one that's square, man.

965
01:25:49,483 --> 01:25:53,487
I don't screw and fuck with a bunch
of killers and junkies the way you do.

966
01:25:53,737 --> 01:25:55,697
You call that being hip?

967
01:25:56,573 --> 01:25:58,367
What world you from?

968
01:26:03,413 --> 01:26:06,917
- Who's a killer?
- Sport's a killer, that's who's a killer.

969
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,169
- Sport never killed nobody.
- He killed somebody.

970
01:26:09,253 --> 01:26:11,255
- He's a Libra.
- He's a what?

971
01:26:11,338 --> 01:26:14,216
I'm a Libra, too.
That's why we get along so well.

972
01:26:17,135 --> 01:26:19,388
He looks like a killer to me.

973
01:26:20,097 --> 01:26:23,267
I think that Cancers make the best lovers...

974
01:26:23,350 --> 01:26:25,978
but, God, my whole family are earth signs.

975
01:26:26,061 --> 01:26:28,063
He's also a dope shooter.

976
01:26:28,522 --> 01:26:32,067
What makes you so high and mighty?
Will you tell me that?

977
01:26:32,150 --> 01:26:35,737
Didn't you ever try looking
at your own eyeballs in the mirror?

978
01:26:41,034 --> 01:26:43,745
So what are you gonna do
about Sport and that old bastard?

979
01:26:43,787 --> 01:26:45,664
- When?
- When you leave.

980
01:26:49,293 --> 01:26:51,920
- I don't know. Just leave them.
- You're just gonna leave?

981
01:26:52,004 --> 01:26:56,466
- They've got plenty of other girls.
- You just can't do that. What will you do?

982
01:26:58,802 --> 01:27:02,973
- What do you want me to do, call the cops?
- Cops don't do nothing. You know that.

983
01:27:03,473 --> 01:27:04,933
Sport never treated me bad.

984
01:27:04,975 --> 01:27:07,311
He didn't beat me up
or anything like that once.

985
01:27:07,394 --> 01:27:10,480
But you can't allow him
to do the same to other girls.

986
01:27:10,981 --> 01:27:13,025
You can't allow him to do that.

987
01:27:13,108 --> 01:27:15,360
He's the lowest kind of person in the world.

988
01:27:15,444 --> 01:27:19,031
Somebody's got to do something to him.
He's the scum of the earth.

989
01:27:19,114 --> 01:27:22,826
He's the worst sucking scum...

990
01:27:22,868 --> 01:27:24,703
I have ever seen.

991
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:29,583
You know what he told me about you?

992
01:27:31,877 --> 01:27:35,506
He's calling you names.
He called you a little piece of chicken.

993
01:27:37,299 --> 01:27:39,468
He doesn't mean that.

994
01:27:42,137 --> 01:27:45,390
I'll move up to one
of them communes in Vermont.

995
01:27:50,187 --> 01:27:53,357
I never seen a commune before,
but I don't know, you know?

996
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:54,691
I saw...

997
01:27:55,943 --> 01:27:59,404
some pictures once in a magazine.
It didn't look very clean.

998
01:27:59,488 --> 01:28:01,782
Why don't you come
to the commune with me?

999
01:28:01,865 --> 01:28:04,743
What, come to the commune with you? No.

1000
01:28:05,536 --> 01:28:06,745
Why not?

1001
01:28:08,705 --> 01:28:11,041
I don't go to places like that.

1002
01:28:11,917 --> 01:28:15,379
- Come on, why not?
- I don't get along with people like that.

1003
01:28:15,420 --> 01:28:17,506
- Are you a Scorpion?
- What?

1004
01:28:17,589 --> 01:28:20,551
That's it, you're a Scorpion.
I can tell every time.

1005
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:23,887
Besides, I got to stay here.

1006
01:28:24,346 --> 01:28:27,349
- Come on, why?
- I got something very important to do.

1007
01:28:27,391 --> 01:28:29,184
What's so important?

1008
01:28:30,644 --> 01:28:32,813
Doing something for the government.

1009
01:28:33,730 --> 01:28:36,066
The cab thing is just part-time.

1010
01:28:37,192 --> 01:28:38,694
Are you a narc?

1011
01:28:41,321 --> 01:28:44,074
- Do I look like a narc?
- Yeah.

1012
01:28:45,617 --> 01:28:47,077
I am a narc.

1013
01:28:48,412 --> 01:28:51,582
God! I don't know who's weirder, you or me.

1014
01:28:58,046 --> 01:28:59,590
Sure you don't wanna come with me?

1015
01:28:59,673 --> 01:29:02,885
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna give you the money to go.

1016
01:29:02,926 --> 01:29:05,679
- No, you don't have to do that.
- No, I want you to take it.

1017
01:29:05,762 --> 01:29:08,348
I don't want you to take anything from them.

1018
01:29:08,724 --> 01:29:10,434
And I wanna do it.

1019
01:29:10,767 --> 01:29:13,896
I don't have anything better to do
with my money.

1020
01:29:15,105 --> 01:29:17,608
I might be going away for a while.

1021
01:29:43,217 --> 01:29:45,511
You're just a little tense, that's all.

1022
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:49,223
I don't like what I'm doing, Sport.

1023
01:29:49,598 --> 01:29:52,601
Baby, I never wanted you
to like what you're doing.

1024
01:29:52,684 --> 01:29:56,647
If you ever liked what you were doing,
you wouldn't be my woman.

1025
01:29:58,357 --> 01:30:00,943
You never spend any time with me anymore.

1026
01:30:00,984 --> 01:30:03,612
I've got to attend to business, baby.

1027
01:30:05,155 --> 01:30:07,324
You miss your man, don't you?

1028
01:30:08,992 --> 01:30:11,828
I don't like to be away from you, either.

1029
01:30:12,663 --> 01:30:14,873
You know how I feel about you.

1030
01:30:16,208 --> 01:30:17,793
I depend on you.

1031
01:30:20,546 --> 01:30:22,506
I'd be lost without you.

1032
01:30:23,465 --> 01:30:25,551
Don't you ever forget that.

1033
01:30:35,143 --> 01:30:36,895
How much I need you.

1034
01:30:39,606 --> 01:30:41,233
Come to me, baby.

1035
01:30:51,535 --> 01:30:53,120
Let me hold you.

1036
01:31:00,043 --> 01:31:03,630
When you're close to me like this,
I feel so good.

1037
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:12,890
I only wish every man could know
what it's like to be loved by you.

1038
01:31:18,312 --> 01:31:20,564
That every woman everywhere...

1039
01:31:22,941 --> 01:31:25,736
had a man that loves her like I love you.

1040
01:31:29,907 --> 01:31:32,743
God, it's good so close.

1041
01:31:45,297 --> 01:31:49,885
You know, at times like this,
I know I'm a lucky man.

1042
01:31:53,388 --> 01:31:56,225
Touching a woman
who wants me and needs me.

1043
01:32:02,439 --> 01:32:05,359
Yeah, it's only you that keeps me together.

1044
01:33:38,202 --> 01:33:42,164
<i>Now I see it clearly.</i>
<i>My whole life is pointed in one direction.</i>

1045
01:33:42,539 --> 01:33:44,082
<i>I see that now.</i>

1046
01:33:45,167 --> 01:33:47,878
<i>There never has been any choice for me.</i>

1047
01:34:23,413 --> 01:34:26,875
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>the next president of the United States...</i>

1048
01:34:26,959 --> 01:34:29,044
<i>Senator Charles Palantine.</i>

1049
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:36,593
<i>Thank you, Tom.</i>

1050
01:34:37,803 --> 01:34:39,429
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

1051
01:34:39,638 --> 01:34:43,725
<i>we are met today at a crossroads:</i>
<i>Columbus Circle.</i>

1052
01:34:44,476 --> 01:34:46,520
<i>This is no ordinary place.</i>

1053
01:34:46,895 --> 01:34:49,314
<i>It is a place where many roads...</i>

1054
01:34:49,815 --> 01:34:51,859
<i>and many lives intersect.</i>

1055
01:34:52,776 --> 01:34:55,696
<i>It is appropriate that we meet here today...</i>

1056
01:34:55,779 --> 01:34:58,407
<i>because these are not ordinary times.</i>

1057
01:34:59,241 --> 01:35:02,703
<i>We meet at a crossroads in history.</i>

1058
01:35:03,745 --> 01:35:06,957
<i>For far too long,</i>
<i>the wrong roads have been taken.</i>

1059
01:35:07,749 --> 01:35:10,460
<i>The wrong roads have led us into war...</i>

1060
01:35:10,878 --> 01:35:14,923
<i>into poverty, into unemployment</i>
<i>and inflation.</i>

1061
01:35:16,049 --> 01:35:19,469
<i>Today I say to you,</i>
<i>we have reached the turning point.</i>

1062
01:35:23,473 --> 01:35:27,603
<i>No longer will we, the people,</i>
<i>suffer for the few.</i>

1063
01:35:35,986 --> 01:35:40,365
<i>Now, I would lie to you if I told you</i>
<i>the new roads would be easy.</i>

1064
01:35:40,908 --> 01:35:42,784
<i>They will not be easy.</i>

1065
01:35:43,285 --> 01:35:46,997
<i>Nothing that is right and good</i>
<i>has ever been easy.</i>

1066
01:35:47,039 --> 01:35:49,082
<i>We, the people, know that.</i>

1067
01:35:52,961 --> 01:35:57,299
<i>And we, the people,</i>
<i>know the right roads and the good.</i>

1068
01:35:58,300 --> 01:36:02,596
<i>Today I say to you,</i>
<i>we are the people, you and I...</i>

1069
01:36:02,679 --> 01:36:05,891
<i>and it is time to let the people rule.</i>

1070
01:36:05,974 --> 01:36:07,309
<i>Thank you.</i>

1071
01:36:23,575 --> 01:36:25,619
All right, let him go, pull back.

1072
01:36:30,832 --> 01:36:32,167
Palantine!

1073
01:36:40,759 --> 01:36:42,094
Thank you.

1074
01:36:47,266 --> 01:36:49,268
Over there. Get that man.

1075
01:36:50,936 --> 01:36:52,563
Give him some air!

1076
01:36:53,063 --> 01:36:55,190
Give him some air, will you?

1077
01:36:55,524 --> 01:36:57,860
- I never saw him.
- I saw him run.

1078
01:36:58,235 --> 01:36:59,736
Where was he?

1079
01:37:25,929 --> 01:37:27,514
- What's happening?
- How you doing?

1080
01:37:27,598 --> 01:37:29,057
Got the money?

1081
01:37:40,152 --> 01:37:42,112
- Iris in her room?
- Yeah.

1082
01:38:18,690 --> 01:38:20,734
Hey, Sport, how you doing?

1083
01:38:20,817 --> 01:38:22,861
Okay, my man. How are you?

1084
01:38:24,404 --> 01:38:27,115
- Where do I know you from?
- I don't know.

1085
01:38:27,658 --> 01:38:30,285
How's everything in the pimp business?

1086
01:38:30,994 --> 01:38:34,206
- Do I know you?
- No. Do I know you?

1087
01:38:35,207 --> 01:38:38,502
- Get out of here. Come on, get lost.
- Do I know you?

1088
01:38:41,004 --> 01:38:42,381
How's Iris?

1089
01:38:42,673 --> 01:38:44,049
You know, Iris.

1090
01:38:44,383 --> 01:38:46,677
I don't know nobody named Iris.

1091
01:38:47,219 --> 01:38:49,805
Iris. Come on, get out of here, man.

1092
01:38:49,847 --> 01:38:52,099
You don't know anybody
by the name of Iris?

1093
01:38:52,182 --> 01:38:54,476
I don't know nobody named Iris.

1094
01:38:55,143 --> 01:38:56,144
No?

1095
01:38:56,228 --> 01:38:58,814
Get back to your fucking tribe
before you get hurt.

1096
01:38:58,897 --> 01:39:01,859
Do me a favor.
I don't want no trouble, okay?

1097
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:04,820
You got a gun?

1098
01:39:06,321 --> 01:39:09,366
Get the fuck out of here, man.
Get out of here.

1099
01:39:09,658 --> 01:39:11,159
Suck on this.

1100
01:40:25,317 --> 01:40:27,611
You crazy son of a bitch!

1101
01:40:27,861 --> 01:40:31,490
Fucking son of a bitch, you! I'll kill you!

1102
01:40:35,536 --> 01:40:37,746
I'll fucking kill you!

1103
01:40:37,788 --> 01:40:40,332
Crazy son of a bitch! I'll kill you!

1104
01:40:58,851 --> 01:41:01,728
You fucking bastard! I'll kill you!

1105
01:41:02,479 --> 01:41:05,899
You crazy son of a bitch! I'll kill you!

1106
01:41:12,823 --> 01:41:13,907
Stop!

1107
01:41:26,753 --> 01:41:28,672
No! Don't shoot him!

1108
01:46:07,826 --> 01:46:09,453
<i>"Dear Mr. Bickle...</i>

1109
01:46:09,536 --> 01:46:13,373
<i>"I can't say how happy</i>
<i>Mrs. Steensma and I were...</i>

1110
01:46:13,457 --> 01:46:16,376
<i>to hear that you are well and recuperating.</i>

1111
01:46:17,044 --> 01:46:19,838
<i>"We tried to visit you at the hospital...</i>

1112
01:46:20,130 --> 01:46:22,966
<i>"when we were in New York to pick up Iris.</i>

1113
01:46:23,133 --> 01:46:25,344
<i>"But you were still in a coma.</i>

1114
01:46:25,969 --> 01:46:30,849
<i>"There is no way we can repay you</i>
<i>for returning our Iris to us.</i>

1115
01:46:31,558 --> 01:46:36,313
<i>"We thought we had lost her,</i>
<i>and now our lives are full again.</i>

1116
01:46:37,064 --> 01:46:38,607
<i>"Needless to say...</i>

1117
01:46:38,649 --> 01:46:42,611
<i>"you are something of a hero</i>
<i>around this household.</i>

1118
01:46:43,904 --> 01:46:47,407
<i>"I'm sure you want to know about Iris.</i>

1119
01:46:47,658 --> 01:46:51,078
<i>"She's back in school and working hard.</i>

1120
01:46:51,662 --> 01:46:56,333
<i>"The transition has been very hard for her,</i>
<i>as you can well imagine.</i>

1121
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,336
<i>"But we have taken steps to see...</i>

1122
01:46:59,378 --> 01:47:02,714
<i>"she has never cause to run away again."</i>

1123
01:47:04,174 --> 01:47:07,719
<i>"In conclusion, Mrs. Steensma and I...</i>

1124
01:47:07,845 --> 01:47:11,640
<i>"would like to again thank you</i>

1125

1126

1127
01:47:21,024 --> 01:47:24,027
<i>"But if you should ever come</i>

1128
01:47:24,194 --> 01:47:28,156
<i>"you would find yourself</i>

1129
01:47:28,949 --> 01:47:30,701
<i>"Our deepest thanks.</i>

1130
01:47:31,243 --> 01:47:33,203
<i>"Burt and Ivy Steensma."</i>

1131
01:47:35,455 --> 01:47:38,125
This guy Eddie, the owner-operator,
comes up and says:

1132
01:47:38,208 --> 01:47:41,628
"I want to swap tires."
I said, "These are new tires."

1133
01:47:41,712 --> 01:47:44,715
"Why don't you throw in something else,
like your wife?"

1134
01:47:44,798 --> 01:47:46,842
His wife was Miss New Jersey 1957.

1135
01:47:46,884 --> 01:47:49,094
That's why the fleet has no spares.

1136
01:47:49,178 --> 01:47:51,180
Doughboy, wizard, killer.

1137
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:53,891
- Charlie T.
- What's happening?

1138
01:47:54,641 --> 01:47:56,560
Travis, you got a fare.

1139
01:47:58,103 --> 01:47:59,188
Shit.

1140
01:48:00,647 --> 01:48:02,983
- See you later.
- See you, Travis.

1141
01:48:24,588 --> 01:48:26,048
Hello, Travis.

1142
01:48:27,799 --> 01:48:28,967
Hello.

1143
01:48:49,863 --> 01:48:52,407
I hear Palantine got the nomination.

1144
01:48:53,825 --> 01:48:56,954
Yeah. Won't be long now. Seventeen days.

1145
01:48:58,205 --> 01:48:59,748
I hope he wins.

1146
01:49:13,595 --> 01:49:17,015
I read about you in the papers.
How are you?

1147
01:49:19,518 --> 01:49:22,271
It was nothing, really. I got over that.

1148
01:49:24,815 --> 01:49:27,276
Papers always blow these things up.

1149
01:49:29,111 --> 01:49:31,989
Just a little stiffness, that's all.

1150
01:50:16,325 --> 01:50:17,910
How much was it?

1151
01:50:27,127 --> 01:50:28,337
So long.
