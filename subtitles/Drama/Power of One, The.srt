1
00:02:28,032 --> 00:02:30,156
Varel industries always trying...

2
00:02:30,544 --> 00:02:34,933
that it should take the video games
world beyond than 3-d technology.

3
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:40,973
Did you ever think when you send
some data from one phone to another,

4
00:02:41,196 --> 00:02:44,588
then how did it reach to across
the corner of the world.

5
00:02:45,386 --> 00:02:47,968
In the world of satellite, mobiles
and internet...

6
00:02:48,088 --> 00:02:52,688
so many rays and frequencies lives
around us,

7
00:02:56,655 --> 00:03:01,044
they have surrounded in our world like
a virtual world.

8
00:03:01,467 --> 00:03:04,542
And this world always surrounding us.

9
00:03:05,275 --> 00:03:09,102
Everywhere...
in shopping malls, houses...

10
00:03:09,865 --> 00:03:12,940
on the streets in fact right now
in this conference room,

11
00:03:18,204 --> 00:03:22,911
and as you know because of these
rays entire digital world travels...

12
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,324
because mr. Barel couldn't come
to meet you,

13
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,080
that's why he sent me his
welcome photo.

14
00:03:31,553 --> 00:03:32,961
Now the matter is that...

15
00:03:33,337 --> 00:03:40,191
can i bring this photo to this room
without any computer...

16
00:03:44,404 --> 00:03:46,716
because our technology is about that.

17
00:04:20,878 --> 00:04:24,728
It's not some magic, projection
or 3-d techonology.

18
00:04:24,986 --> 00:04:29,154
It has been made from those rays what
are always surroundings by you,

19
00:04:29,483 --> 00:04:31,114
but you can't see them,

20
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:37,581
but with our techonology you can see
that and touch as well.

21
00:04:42,352 --> 00:04:47,751
What can remove the difference between
the real and virtual world.

22
00:05:27,858 --> 00:05:30,886
That night was so beautiful.

23
00:05:31,701 --> 00:05:33,203
And that girl too,

24
00:05:36,968 --> 00:05:40,433
night was waiting for the dawn,
and the girl was waiting for me,

25
00:05:42,649 --> 00:05:43,381
waiting for me.

26
00:05:44,517 --> 00:05:47,250
I am lucifer.

27
00:05:50,834 --> 00:05:54,346
Sometimes you have to take life to
save life.

28
00:05:55,116 --> 00:06:00,777
And the most three bruce lee's friend
was ready to get killed.

29
00:06:08,054 --> 00:06:09,265
Then the fight was...

30
00:06:10,462 --> 00:06:11,936
from the big daddy.

31
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,997
He was the only one who could
fight with me,

32
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:18,884
not a hero but villain,

33
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:31,802
what should i do?

34
00:07:32,624 --> 00:07:34,473
Every girl likes me,

35
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:51,665
i don't like unexpectable guests...

36
00:07:52,313 --> 00:07:55,355
bad time always come unexpected,
do you know who am i?

37
00:07:56,116 --> 00:07:58,210
I just killed spiderman,

38
00:07:59,142 --> 00:08:01,743
from baygon spray.
What kind of insect you are?

39
00:08:02,072 --> 00:08:03,752
You always make punch lines...

40
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:06,795
or punch too?
Both of them!

41
00:08:07,283 --> 00:08:08,588
People applause on one,

42
00:08:09,019 --> 00:08:11,376
and it only screw up on other one.

43
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,846
Be carefull!

44
00:08:16,343 --> 00:08:17,911
Don't worry my desi girl.

45
00:08:18,637 --> 00:08:21,247
Let me handle him then
how about dinner.

46
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:24,496
Sure! But where?
Wherever you say,

47
00:08:24,946 --> 00:08:26,862
not only chinese,
i just had it,

48
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:32,087
if your story is ever,

49
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:33,655
then shall we start the fight,

50
00:09:00,266 --> 00:09:02,370
he have such a big gun,

51
00:10:13,115 --> 00:10:14,364
you guys have started again,

52
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:16,961
get up!

53
00:11:11,305 --> 00:11:13,174
But i can't talk on phone,

54
00:11:15,718 --> 00:11:19,666
don't talk to me on phone and drive
your car with concentration,

55
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,273
what's happening in office today?

56
00:12:47,847 --> 00:12:51,153
I am not fond of to see your faces
in the morning,

57
00:12:51,866 --> 00:12:56,535
i just want to tell you that our
company got a contract of game,

58
00:12:56,655 --> 00:12:59,286
and this game will be release
in india,

59
00:12:59,406 --> 00:13:01,728
but this department's previous
two games...

60
00:13:01,848 --> 00:13:04,392
were totally flopped,
and if this game will be flop...

61
00:13:04,512 --> 00:13:06,260
then i will have to shut this
department down,

62
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,321
i won't suspend anyone,

63
00:13:11,744 --> 00:13:13,874
because i am about to open
a restaurant here,

64
00:13:15,508 --> 00:13:18,118
you and you will become waiter.

65
00:13:24,093 --> 00:13:27,586
And i will make you main cook.

66
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:32,676
Because you will serve
marathi dishes here.

67
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,742
Does anyone have any problem?

68
00:13:45,359 --> 00:13:46,242
I have a problem,

69
00:13:46,899 --> 00:13:48,721
and what's your problem?

70
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,321
I can't make idaly.

71
00:13:57,507 --> 00:13:59,273
Dosa?
I can make dosa.

72
00:14:40,557 --> 00:14:41,806
You are working really hard,

73
00:14:48,962 --> 00:14:50,305
i know you are not taking
me seriously.

74
00:14:51,525 --> 00:14:54,023
But when my book will be in
best seller's list.

75
00:14:54,549 --> 00:14:55,263
Then you will see...

76
00:14:55,383 --> 00:14:58,117
you don't know these thesis are
really important for me,

77
00:14:59,557 --> 00:15:01,275
how necessary is for india,

78
00:15:01,669 --> 00:15:03,745
how necessary is for every
indian girl.

79
00:15:05,228 --> 00:15:07,538
You are sonia subhramaniam not
sonia gandhi,

80
00:15:10,434 --> 00:15:12,124
why every abuse is like that in india.

81
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:18,359
When my thesis will be over,

82
00:15:18,847 --> 00:15:23,086
then every indian woman...

83
00:15:23,396 --> 00:15:24,589
you are crossing the limits.

84
00:15:25,603 --> 00:15:26,664
Will proudly say...

85
00:15:34,598 --> 00:15:37,162
why the song is so loud?
I am not singing,

86
00:15:37,282 --> 00:15:38,965
i am just saying that...
not you.

87
00:15:46,537 --> 00:15:47,824
Can't you lower the volume?

88
00:15:50,237 --> 00:15:51,627
Ofcourse it could be lower,

89
00:16:20,138 --> 00:16:21,800
tell us about your new
video game,

90
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:37,225
it's totally a new game and it
has a new hero.

91
00:16:42,314 --> 00:16:44,605
Heroes are boring either they
are new or old.

92
00:16:44,869 --> 00:16:47,320
You don't like heroes then who
do you like? Villain?

93
00:16:49,423 --> 00:16:52,155
They have no rules,
all they have to win,

94
00:16:52,275 --> 00:16:55,085
and if anyone comes to their
way then just bang.

95
00:17:00,163 --> 00:17:02,736
Make a game where villain
never lose.

96
00:17:05,215 --> 00:17:06,267
Hero always wins.

97
00:17:08,173 --> 00:17:10,295
Truth always wins.

98
00:18:21,964 --> 00:18:23,766
I will show you to become a dad.

99
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,471
Mom! What are you doing?
Come fast we have to go school.

100
00:18:29,325 --> 00:18:30,546
Today your dad will drop
you to school.

101
00:18:31,845 --> 00:18:34,023
If dad will drive then we will
reach to school after 2 days.

102
00:19:33,993 --> 00:19:35,598
But i wanted to tell you one thing,

103
00:19:35,889 --> 00:19:37,382
you like villains.

104
00:19:37,589 --> 00:19:42,143
Then i will make a video game where
villain is powerful than hero.

105
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:44,612
Where villain will never lose.

106
00:19:48,463 --> 00:19:49,984
Always remember one thing...

107
00:20:21,776 --> 00:20:23,419
what is lucifer?

108
00:20:24,226 --> 00:20:27,344
Whenever i uses this computer and
play any video game,

109
00:20:27,464 --> 00:20:28,703
my name is always lucifer,

110
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:43,550
i mean miss. Boel's computer can
be connected with our computers.

111
00:20:50,594 --> 00:20:54,679
Miss. Boel will ask the permission
to connect from our computer.

112
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,284
We all will say no,

113
00:20:56,404 --> 00:20:59,392
but only one fatso will say yes.

114
00:21:39,311 --> 00:21:41,800
I have such a great idea for
our new video game,

115
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:45,156
we will make the most dangerous...

116
00:21:45,276 --> 00:21:47,212
hero.
Villain!

117
00:21:49,372 --> 00:21:52,837
Why villain?
Because villains are kick ass.

118
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:58,833
All for prateek,

119
00:23:15,884 --> 00:23:17,799
what will be our villain's name?

120
00:23:18,882 --> 00:23:22,074
How long we will call him
random access version one,

121
00:23:28,753 --> 00:23:31,184
it's front of your eyes.
Where?

122
00:23:52,457 --> 00:23:53,838
And what's our hero's name?

123
00:25:40,466 --> 00:25:43,555
What are you doing?
I need hero's face.

124
00:26:03,879 --> 00:26:06,668
Very good and this smile
is amazing,

125
00:26:09,788 --> 00:26:13,300
i didn't put this smile in programme,
you didn't put it.

126
00:26:15,554 --> 00:26:17,976
Why ra one is smiling in game,

127
00:26:19,066 --> 00:26:21,798
this programme is not learning
things by itself.

128
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,083
Everyone look carefully.

129
00:26:36,459 --> 00:26:39,435
This is the main part of
our game.

130
00:26:47,902 --> 00:26:48,897
This heart is not an heart.

131
00:26:52,843 --> 00:26:56,505
It will have the strength of
every player.

132
00:27:02,207 --> 00:27:05,710
After winning every level this
heart's strength will increase.

133
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:08,179
And it will become more blue.

134
00:27:12,911 --> 00:27:16,921
Until this heart doesn't attached with
g one and ra one's system,

135
00:27:18,538 --> 00:27:21,693
till then you can't kill
both of them,

136
00:27:24,895 --> 00:27:28,266
and to break the heart these
both won't die.

137
00:27:39,268 --> 00:27:42,648
Perhaps they won't die to
hit their bodies.

138
00:27:43,183 --> 00:27:48,263
When their hearts will be attached
with their bodies so you can kill them,

139
00:27:49,394 --> 00:27:51,948
but how they will die?

140
00:27:54,155 --> 00:27:56,859
Here they will get an anti heart gun.

141
00:27:57,065 --> 00:27:59,169
Which will have only one bullet.

142
00:27:59,522 --> 00:28:01,945
Amongst both of them whoever will
shoot the aim first,

143
00:28:02,424 --> 00:28:04,011
he will won the game,

144
00:28:06,593 --> 00:28:11,375
whoever will miss his aim he
will be die.

145
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:16,408
So this heart is their strength
and their weakness as well.

146
00:28:51,762 --> 00:28:54,757
See! In this film villain lost again.

147
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,558
That's why thos movie was a flop.

148
00:28:58,393 --> 00:29:01,539
Did you see villain was so cool,
he wasn't cool but bloody fool.

149
00:29:01,659 --> 00:29:04,525
He was smoking ciggarettes and
ciggarette kills...

150
00:29:05,836 --> 00:29:07,169
this kid is smoking,

151
00:29:07,289 --> 00:29:09,470
let's go.
No! I will talk to him,

152
00:29:11,423 --> 00:29:13,075
does your mom knows you smoke?

153
00:29:41,991 --> 00:29:44,752
What else you have?
I gave you everything.

154
00:29:48,982 --> 00:29:50,222
You didn't see me okay?

155
00:42:12,098 --> 00:42:13,572
I am heading to level 3.

156
00:42:17,082 --> 00:42:19,082
Nobody can beat ra one.

157
00:42:24,454 --> 00:42:28,548
Otherwise i will come to your world
and kill you.

158
00:42:35,714 --> 00:42:37,724
Nobody can beat ra one.

159
00:42:46,479 --> 00:42:47,840
This game will be over...

160
00:42:48,967 --> 00:42:51,146
when i will finish you.

161
00:43:32,785 --> 00:43:36,146
I will have to stay in lab.
There is some problem in the game.

162
00:44:21,204 --> 00:44:23,167
Today you have done amazing job,

163
00:45:30,248 --> 00:45:32,494
you really like the game,
yeah!

164
00:45:33,133 --> 00:45:35,471
You really like that game that you
hug your dad,

165
00:45:37,171 --> 00:45:39,725
i just wanted to say that game
was really amazing.

166
00:45:39,956 --> 00:45:42,238
So why you didn't said it?
We live in a same house.

167
00:45:42,829 --> 00:45:44,097
I can say it tomorrow.

168
00:45:56,235 --> 00:45:58,189
Aakashi is saying that...

169
00:52:30,798 --> 00:52:32,075
please pick up the phone.

170
00:53:17,265 --> 00:53:19,406
Out from the game,

171
00:53:20,166 --> 00:53:22,673
i want lucifer,

172
00:53:27,194 --> 00:53:29,166
i will finish him,

173
00:53:32,950 --> 00:53:34,246
are you lucifer?

174
00:53:38,987 --> 00:53:40,875
Are you lucifer?

175
00:53:45,459 --> 00:53:46,567
I am lucifer!

176
00:53:56,826 --> 00:53:58,911
You are lying,

177
00:57:23,547 --> 00:57:24,777
what happen?

178
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,106
Dad didn't met an accident,

179
00:57:29,653 --> 00:57:31,033
ra one killed him,

180
00:57:35,165 --> 00:57:36,235
game's villain!

181
00:57:37,239 --> 00:57:38,676
What are you saying?

182
00:58:13,252 --> 00:58:15,777
I said i am not going to india.
Listen to me,

183
00:58:15,897 --> 00:58:17,918
i have to find out what happened
with dad,

184
00:58:18,144 --> 00:58:19,496
your dad met an accident,

185
00:58:20,569 --> 00:58:21,856
we are going to india tonight,

186
00:58:23,302 --> 00:58:24,213
i am not going,

187
00:59:43,281 --> 00:59:44,398
you were right,

188
00:59:45,046 --> 00:59:47,497
my god! How did it happen?

189
00:59:47,929 --> 00:59:49,234
Ra one said it...

190
00:59:49,637 --> 00:59:51,872
that i will come out from the game
and find you,

191
00:59:57,406 --> 01:00:00,524
this is the first control suit for you.

192
01:00:01,162 --> 01:00:04,073
I have made a ra one like
you wanted.

193
01:00:04,461 --> 01:00:05,597
But remember...

194
01:00:05,842 --> 01:00:07,982
if ra one has made from a
devil thought...

195
01:00:09,015 --> 01:00:10,931
then g one has been made
from my heart.

196
01:00:31,738 --> 01:00:34,001
And if you will be stuck in
the game...

197
01:00:34,255 --> 01:00:35,766
then my g one will show you
the right way.

198
01:01:35,011 --> 01:01:37,340
It means ra one has become aakashi,

199
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:40,986
thanks for the help.

200
01:01:54,458 --> 01:01:57,266
Where are you?
Ra one has killed my dad.

201
01:01:57,717 --> 01:01:59,745
Ra one has become aakashi,
what are you saying?

202
01:02:00,043 --> 01:02:02,540
Where are you? It's flight time.
I am in the dad's office.

203
01:02:02,860 --> 01:02:04,456
You stay there i am coming.

204
01:02:14,376 --> 01:02:17,165
I will try to connect again and
you try to log in,

205
01:02:23,201 --> 01:02:25,285
now upload the ra one's
back up programme.

206
01:02:26,187 --> 01:02:27,605
It doesn't have ra one's programme.

207
01:02:30,555 --> 01:02:33,410
We have to intercept this programme
otherwise how we will stop ra one.

208
01:02:43,174 --> 01:02:45,737
If ra one can come out then
g one as well...

209
01:02:51,082 --> 01:02:53,636
we can try to follow up those steps
and take the g one out.

210
01:02:54,491 --> 01:02:55,786
Load this programme.
Okay!

211
01:03:33,292 --> 01:03:35,583
I just saw aakashi was going
upstairs...

212
01:03:36,203 --> 01:03:37,151
what happen?

213
01:03:38,362 --> 01:03:41,151
It was sonia's phone call,
ra one is coming upstairs...

214
01:03:41,790 --> 01:03:43,245
you go from here,
no! I will must have to try it.

215
01:03:43,365 --> 01:03:45,945
I will must have to take g one out.

216
01:03:46,065 --> 01:03:47,635
Ra one is coming after you.

217
01:03:47,945 --> 01:03:50,208
I will try because he doesn't
know me.

218
01:13:04,716 --> 01:13:07,368
Why he is coming with us?
Mom! G one saved us.

219
01:13:07,488 --> 01:13:10,408
Mom! G one saved us...
okay bye...

220
01:13:19,326 --> 01:13:21,228
that's what i am saying.
He can't come anyway...

221
01:13:22,401 --> 01:13:24,479
you will have to cover up.
I will have to cover up.

222
01:13:27,698 --> 01:13:29,306
What are you doing?

223
01:13:40,450 --> 01:13:43,678
I don't understand anything,
please try to understand...

224
01:13:45,673 --> 01:13:47,164
i will understand it later.

225
01:13:47,633 --> 01:13:48,936
First you tell me that...

226
01:13:49,056 --> 01:13:52,070
how we will pass this thing from
that metal detector.

227
01:13:53,397 --> 01:13:56,566
Try to understand he can't
come with us.

228
01:14:03,303 --> 01:14:04,923
G one!
Can you do it...

229
01:14:22,212 --> 01:14:23,597
what are you doing?

230
01:14:23,832 --> 01:14:26,097
Act like ra one...

231
01:14:27,741 --> 01:14:30,921
i can't do it like ra one.

232
01:14:31,396 --> 01:14:33,122
Because i am not powerfull like ra one.

233
01:14:38,943 --> 01:14:40,281
Shall i take off my pent?

234
01:16:24,851 --> 01:16:26,201
Who made you taxi driver?

235
01:16:26,447 --> 01:16:28,454
You and your taxi both will go,

236
01:16:28,574 --> 01:16:30,156
do you know the rules?

237
01:16:37,748 --> 01:16:39,732
Will you come with me?
What nonsense?

238
01:16:44,030 --> 01:16:45,391
I will take you,

239
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:53,689
what are you doing?
He will die.

240
01:16:53,924 --> 01:16:56,659
Then i will reset him again and
press the play button,

241
01:16:57,342 --> 01:17:00,276
he is human not a tape recorder.
Shut up!

242
01:17:00,734 --> 01:17:03,293
It's not a game if someone dies
here once

243
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:05,100
then he never come back,

244
01:17:05,934 --> 01:17:08,304
he can come like human changes
his clothes...

245
01:17:08,621 --> 01:17:10,358
soul can change the body and
came back,

246
01:17:13,562 --> 01:17:15,627
which page?
47.

247
01:17:16,836 --> 01:17:18,327
Tell him to leave him,

248
01:17:18,644 --> 01:17:20,698
g one!
Leave him,

249
01:19:32,094 --> 01:19:34,406
you can't touch me here,
so! Where i can touch you?

250
01:19:35,008 --> 01:19:37,215
You can't touch me anywhere.
So! How would i save you?

251
01:19:37,461 --> 01:19:39,104
You don't need to save me,

252
01:19:43,071 --> 01:19:44,621
g one!
Help!

253
01:19:49,766 --> 01:19:52,501
Why did you stop? Do something!
I will have to touch you,

254
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:54,496
then touch me,

255
01:20:02,247 --> 01:20:03,374
hit the punch,

256
01:24:11,093 --> 01:24:13,617
listen! You are my dad and he is
dad's friend, say hi.

257
01:24:25,436 --> 01:24:26,539
You did it,
no!

258
01:25:08,509 --> 01:25:09,506
What did you say?

259
01:25:10,574 --> 01:25:12,628
I have shekhar's folder in
my programme,

260
01:25:13,180 --> 01:25:14,694
which has many lines like that,

261
01:25:15,621 --> 01:25:16,431
do you have more?

262
01:25:16,803 --> 01:25:18,587
"Who says my size is bigger than
everyone"

263
01:25:19,444 --> 01:25:21,486
have you ever spend a night
with a mosquito"

264
01:25:36,433 --> 01:25:38,311
if you don't understand this folder,

265
01:25:38,639 --> 01:25:40,670
then i can delete it,

266
01:25:45,298 --> 01:25:46,589
never delete it,

267
01:26:09,911 --> 01:26:11,613
g one is on stand by,

268
01:26:11,733 --> 01:26:13,350
go somewhere else.

269
01:26:21,872 --> 01:26:24,984
When everything will be settle down
then i will have to do something,

270
01:26:25,876 --> 01:26:28,787
he can't stay with us,
not at all...

271
01:26:29,045 --> 01:26:31,956
he is not a tv who be placed
in a corner,

272
01:26:32,602 --> 01:26:36,311
he talks like humans,
and he looks like dad,

273
01:26:42,206 --> 01:26:44,894
do you think g one was right
about geeta.

274
01:26:46,361 --> 01:26:50,211
It's also possible that dad has become
g one and came to protect us,

275
01:26:54,408 --> 01:26:57,647
do you remember whenever we were in
trouble what dad always said...

276
01:27:18,818 --> 01:27:20,790
i have charged inverter you want
to charge something else.

277
01:27:20,910 --> 01:27:22,293
Yes!
Mom's mood...

278
01:27:30,179 --> 01:27:32,550
don't you ashame talking like that
in front of kid.

279
01:27:32,773 --> 01:27:34,921
Go to sleep.
I don't sleep.

280
01:27:35,343 --> 01:27:37,444
I do run...
do whatever you want,

281
01:27:44,832 --> 01:27:47,390
now i know what i have to do
with him,

282
01:27:47,510 --> 01:27:50,067
we will send him to assylum,
he is totally crazy,

283
01:38:54,363 --> 01:38:57,203
why do we pray?
So god could protect us,

284
01:38:57,508 --> 01:38:59,527
so god came out from there
and protect us,

285
01:38:59,647 --> 01:39:01,319
no! He send his angels...

286
01:39:03,678 --> 01:39:06,296
do you believe in angels?
Shut up and pray.

287
01:39:40,024 --> 01:39:41,280
Who are you?

288
01:39:44,038 --> 01:39:45,364
How did you enter inside?

289
01:40:19,878 --> 01:40:21,450
I want lucifer.

290
01:40:23,387 --> 01:40:26,779
Prateek subhramaniam,
shekhar's son.

291
01:40:27,108 --> 01:40:31,040
He have my heart and i am incomplete
without my heart,

292
01:40:38,479 --> 01:40:40,204
they are gone and...

293
01:40:40,709 --> 01:40:43,103
their address is not in record,

294
01:40:45,951 --> 01:40:46,819
what are you doing?

295
01:40:49,202 --> 01:40:52,735
I am helping you to remind,
you don't need to do it,

296
01:40:58,337 --> 01:41:00,942
i can read your mind,

297
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:05,109
i can change it and i can
even control it,

298
01:41:38,959 --> 01:41:41,553
wife prays for her husband's life.

299
01:41:44,757 --> 01:41:46,893
We have good memories from
this house,

300
01:41:49,622 --> 01:41:51,019
that's why i wanted to come here,

301
01:41:51,887 --> 01:41:52,838
but sonia...

302
01:41:53,378 --> 01:41:55,138
we can't stay on single place longer,

303
01:41:56,112 --> 01:41:59,328
we will have to leave this house,
ra one can come here anytime,

304
01:42:00,485 --> 01:42:02,140
until we have ra one's heart,

305
01:42:04,288 --> 01:42:05,720
he can find prateek,

306
01:42:08,150 --> 01:42:11,706
if we will destroy ra one's heart he
still won't following us,

307
01:42:12,610 --> 01:42:14,558
we will always keep escaping
from him,

308
01:42:15,899 --> 01:42:18,916
and if don't destroy the heart so we
will have to face ra one,

309
01:42:25,688 --> 01:42:27,085
this is an emotional decision,

310
01:42:30,570 --> 01:42:32,190
you will have to take this decision,

311
01:42:35,512 --> 01:42:37,566
finally i have this thing left,

312
01:42:38,070 --> 01:42:41,345
this house, prateek and
shekhar's memories,

313
01:42:42,303 --> 01:42:43,829
i won't leave this house,

314
01:42:45,542 --> 01:42:48,758
i won't escape anymore,
shekhar trusted in humanity,

315
01:43:04,094 --> 01:43:05,796
you won't let anything happen
to my prateek,

316
01:43:34,996 --> 01:43:36,663
it's not in my programme.

317
01:43:46,160 --> 01:43:47,874
But those have all these things
in their programme,

318
01:43:48,742 --> 01:43:50,139
they don't do anything for others,

319
01:43:50,879 --> 01:43:52,651
as much you have done for us,

320
01:45:27,037 --> 01:45:28,223
what's all this?

321
01:45:28,622 --> 01:45:30,429
Can't you see they are burning raavan,

322
01:45:35,330 --> 01:45:37,583
why?
It's dasera!

323
01:45:37,888 --> 01:45:40,459
It means raavan finish,

324
01:45:40,693 --> 01:45:42,325
people burn it every year,

325
01:45:43,088 --> 01:45:45,306
you burn raavan every year,

326
01:45:45,787 --> 01:45:48,134
because you know he never dies,

327
01:46:01,095 --> 01:46:02,433
who dies once,

328
01:46:02,844 --> 01:46:04,675
you don't need to kill him over
and over again,

329
01:46:31,873 --> 01:46:33,716
you are looking good in
dad's clothes.

330
01:46:33,836 --> 01:46:37,143
Shekhar and mr. Lyer celebrates their
kid's birthday together

331
01:46:40,316 --> 01:46:43,145
everyone knows shekhar here,
please! Don't make any trouble.

332
01:46:52,256 --> 01:46:54,967
Shekhar built this game for prateek,

333
01:46:57,173 --> 01:46:59,263
he said he will present him
on his birthday,

334
01:47:01,270 --> 01:47:03,218
if you will present this game
to prateek,

335
01:47:04,124 --> 01:47:05,462
from his dad's behalf,

336
01:47:06,331 --> 01:47:08,983
then he will be very happy,
and what about you?

337
01:47:11,777 --> 01:47:13,420
I will also like it,

338
02:02:13,857 --> 02:02:15,488
prateek!
Nothing will happen to him.

339
02:14:03,884 --> 02:14:06,598
You said this plan will work.
You can't die g one.

340
02:14:11,433 --> 02:14:13,255
You also prepare to die.

341
02:14:24,442 --> 02:14:25,409
We are ready.

342
02:14:32,455 --> 02:14:33,592
You forgot...

343
02:14:33,789 --> 02:14:36,653
until our hearts are not connected
from our system,

344
02:14:36,925 --> 02:14:38,530
we both can't die.

345
02:14:42,045 --> 02:14:44,750
I didn't forgot but lucifer forgot,

346
02:14:45,191 --> 02:14:47,473
he needed a villain whom you
never killed,

347
02:15:01,971 --> 02:15:03,793
and if you didn't choose the
real ra one...

348
02:15:05,887 --> 02:15:08,018
whose the real one amongst them?
I didn't play this game yet,

349
02:15:42,153 --> 02:15:43,674
no! It's not possible.

350
02:15:43,883 --> 02:15:45,611
Dad will never let evil win,

351
02:15:50,277 --> 02:15:52,437
there must be something in this game,
dad must have left something,

352
02:15:55,921 --> 02:15:58,522
i have a folder,
check in the folder,

353
02:16:10,564 --> 02:16:12,649
real ra one has a shadow,

354
02:18:03,784 --> 02:18:05,107
now i will have to go,

355
02:18:07,176 --> 02:18:09,955
it wasn't the plan,
it was always the plan,

356
02:18:11,138 --> 02:18:12,781
it's the plan and this plan
will remain,

357
02:18:13,429 --> 02:18:15,467
if we have to kill the ra one forever,

358
02:18:16,556 --> 02:18:19,595
then i will have to take ra one
and go back to that world...

359
02:18:20,806 --> 02:18:22,158
where we both came from,

360
02:18:25,088 --> 02:18:26,985
please! Don't leave me,

361
02:18:27,307 --> 02:18:29,195
i can't lose my dad again,

362
02:18:29,974 --> 02:18:33,138
no! You will never lose your dad,

363
02:18:34,556 --> 02:18:36,368
until you have humanity
in your heart,

364
02:18:37,636 --> 02:18:39,710
you dad will always with you,

365
02:18:42,085 --> 02:18:43,606
good people died,

366
02:18:45,494 --> 02:18:47,193
but their humanity always remain alive,

367
02:19:30,474 --> 02:19:31,667
and tell sonia...

368
02:19:32,534 --> 02:19:36,093
we both killed ra one...

369
02:20:59,525 --> 02:21:01,385
you know i am really happy that
you came back,

370
02:21:02,361 --> 02:21:03,375
are you alright?

371
02:21:04,915 --> 02:21:05,957
How is prateek?

372
02:21:06,077 --> 02:21:07,577
He is busy on computer all day long,

373
02:21:08,037 --> 02:21:09,924
he says he will revive
g one's heart,

374
02:21:27,453 --> 02:21:28,654
don't snatch his hope from him,

375
02:21:30,016 --> 02:21:31,490
by the way where is my lucifer?
