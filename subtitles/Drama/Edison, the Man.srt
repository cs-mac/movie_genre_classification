00:00:17,077 --> 00:00:21,927
EDISON, THE MAN

2
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,720
The true test of civilization of
a country is not in its census

3
00:01:28,243 --> 00:01:31,703
or the size of their cities
or the size of their crops,

4
00:01:32,109 --> 00:01:35,639
but in the kind of men it produces.

00:01:37,408 --> 00:01:40,228
FIFTY ANNIVERSARY OF LIGHT

6
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:54,905
Mr. Parks.

7
00:01:56,415 --> 00:01:58,395
Mr. Edison has not left the house, sir.

8
00:01:59,165 --> 00:02:01,745
- Any idea what's wrong?
- No sir, I do not.

9
00:02:02,392 --> 00:02:04,502
- Better watch and tells me.
- Yes sir. We wait.

10
00:02:04,743 --> 00:02:07,773
- Go personally, fast.
- Yes sir.

11
00:02:13,071 --> 00:02:19,361
"To a very pretty girl." Thomas A. Edison.

12
00:02:27,536 --> 00:02:28,596
Thank you.

13
00:02:30,365 --> 00:02:32,585
You know fountain pens are a mystery to me?

14
00:02:32,835 --> 00:02:34,684
Can I publish it in the
school newspaper, Mr. Edison?

15
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:36,688
Nancy, please, that's a stupid question.

16
00:02:37,059 --> 00:02:40,159
- Tell me, Mr. Edison!
- Nancy, is your name?

17
00:02:40,366 --> 00:02:41,556
Yes, Nancy Gray.

18
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,140
It's a nice name.

19
00:02:45,626 --> 00:02:48,846
- I always liked the name.
- Was the name of your mother, right?

20
00:02:51,763 --> 00:02:53,193
Maybe that's why I like it.

21
00:02:53,835 --> 00:02:56,425
Tell me, Mr. Edison, what
is the formula for success?

22
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:59,010
We know the formula, do not you remember?

23
00:02:59,214 --> 00:03:03,794
Success is 1% inspiration and 99%
perspiration, is not it, Mr. Edison?

24
00:03:06,546 --> 00:03:09,886
Sure 1% inspiration is
very important, you know?

25
00:03:09,928 --> 00:03:12,058
You have to have it, you can not invent.

26
00:03:12,097 --> 00:03:14,357
- You also learn at school.
- How?

27
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:16,624
- That not learn in school.
- Do not.

28
00:03:17,584 --> 00:03:19,144
No, I think not.

29
00:03:20,373 --> 00:03:22,376
Although I have not gone
to school almost anything.

30
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,350
Do not? Who taught you then?

31
00:03:24,676 --> 00:03:28,296
- A teacher.
- But he said it was not the school.

32
00:03:28,337 --> 00:03:30,287
Nancy, my mother.

33
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:33,121
What do you think was
the greatest invention?

34
00:03:33,363 --> 00:03:35,953
Does the press, electricity, radio?

35
00:03:35,993 --> 00:03:37,783
- The greatest invention?
- Yes sir.

36
00:03:40,336 --> 00:03:43,996
- A blade of grass.
- But that's not an invention.

37
00:03:44,037 --> 00:03:47,697
Oh, yes it is, it is an
invention of nature.

38
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:51,556
Did you ever stop to think why
it grows, why is it green?

39
00:03:52,928 --> 00:03:54,038
No sir.

40
00:03:55,358 --> 00:03:58,698
Mr. Edison, what would you say is the
most valuable thing in the world?

41
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,085
That is easy.

42
00:04:00,738 --> 00:04:03,398
- Time.
- Time?

43
00:04:04,165 --> 00:04:07,535
For all the money in the world
you can not buy a minute of it.

44
00:04:14,883 --> 00:04:17,593
Are you ready to go to the meeting?

45
00:04:17,912 --> 00:04:21,782
Oh, the meeting, I forgot the time.
Never use clock.

46
00:04:22,813 --> 00:04:25,643
- Never wear a watch, is important.
- Yes, it's interesting.

47
00:04:25,677 --> 00:04:28,357
- Nancy Goodbye, good luck.
- Goodbye.

48
00:04:28,392 --> 00:04:31,132
- Goodbye Mr. Edison, thanks.
- Nothing, nothing.

49
00:04:52,061 --> 00:04:53,851
I did not remember the meeting.

50
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:59,300
Here we celebrate the golden
jubilee of electricity.

51
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:03,772
In this replica of Independence Hall.

52
00:05:04,055 --> 00:05:07,995
I think with Mr. Randry Ford, who built it,

53
00:05:08,239 --> 00:05:11,789
Thomas Edison who, through their work,

54
00:05:11,825 --> 00:05:15,405
He has devised a new kind of
declaration of independence.

55
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:23,099
He said with his work and with
a force greater than any man.

56
00:05:23,341 --> 00:05:25,531
The liberation of the human mind.

57
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:30,902
The world's people are
witnesses, and we are here to

58
00:05:31,509 --> 00:05:33,539
honor him on behalf of all.

59
00:05:34,219 --> 00:05:37,479
But there was a time that had no witnesses.

60
00:05:38,363 --> 00:05:41,233
And I had to walk slowly, against all,

61
00:05:41,267 --> 00:05:44,127
ignorance, doubt, envy and greed.

62
00:05:45,057 --> 00:05:51,107
Years ago in Port Loran, Mr.
Edison worked as a telegrapher.

63
00:05:51,353 --> 00:05:55,383
In silence, he is studying
the use of a new force.

64
00:05:55,656 --> 00:05:56,656
Electricity.

65
00:05:57,171 --> 00:06:02,641
In 1869, he left the
west and went to Boston.

66
00:06:02,669 --> 00:06:08,119
Where his first invention, a counter
unit of votes, was rejected.

67
00:06:09,722 --> 00:06:13,702
He came to the city of New York.

68
00:06:22,553 --> 00:06:23,553
Thank you.

69
00:06:28,132 --> 00:06:30,322
- Who is that?
- I do not know.

70
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,350
Hey, you.

71
00:06:44,867 --> 00:06:45,867
You.

72
00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:56,499
What are you doing there?

73
00:06:56,981 --> 00:06:58,691
Get out of there.

74
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:05,545
- Why he has not stopped?
- Stop me?

75
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,373
I have heard, I have called three times.

76
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:10,480
- Sorry, I have hearing problems.
- What's there?

77
00:07:10,808 --> 00:07:12,518
Let's open.

78
00:07:15,311 --> 00:07:17,021
Oh, books.

79
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:20,534
- What is going on here?
- I think I've been rude.

80
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,235
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

81
00:07:23,917 --> 00:07:27,147
I am looking for a telegraph
operator named Cabbot, But Cabbot.

82
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,420
He said he would find
here in this building.

83
00:07:29,451 --> 00:07:31,731
- His name is Thomas Edison?
- Yes sir.

84
00:07:31,762 --> 00:07:33,082
I am the uncle But Cabbot.

85
00:07:33,521 --> 00:07:35,911
- ¡The number is me!
- ¿Oh, como estas Mr. The?

86
00:07:35,946 --> 00:07:36,946
Come with me.

87
00:07:37,705 --> 00:07:40,205
- Have you been to Boston?
- Yes, sir.

88
00:07:40,249 --> 00:07:42,719
- Have you been to New York before?
- Do not.

89
00:07:43,084 --> 00:07:43,854
Are you planning to stay?

90
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:46,471
I think so, Bunt promised me get a job.

91
00:07:47,148 --> 00:07:51,128
¡But! Aquí está Thomas Edison.

92
00:07:53,444 --> 00:07:58,984
- How are you?
- How old are you my friend?

93
00:07:59,018 --> 00:08:00,208
As ever in my life.

94
00:08:01,015 --> 00:08:03,685
Good. What are you doing?
Are you coming or going?

95
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,720
Well, I'm leaving.

96
00:08:04,761 --> 00:08:06,801
You can not do that, I just got here.

97
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:10,983
It is suggested Uncle Ben said
he could stay if he worked.

98
00:08:11,012 --> 00:08:12,882
Look at what you want it to work.

99
00:08:13,288 --> 00:08:17,058
I am telegrapher. A man
has to set some limits.

100
00:08:17,352 --> 00:08:21,542
- And the job you promised me?
- You should not work in New York,

101
00:08:21,571 --> 00:08:23,221
This city is not good for you.

102
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,280
Skyscrapers haunt the spirit and soul.

103
00:08:26,876 --> 00:08:28,586
How are you going to torment my soul?

104
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:32,609
I always wanted to come to New York.
I am here and I will stay.

105
00:08:35,204 --> 00:08:41,024
- Has anyone died? What does it smell like?
- Oh, that's, that's...

106
00:08:41,778 --> 00:08:46,518
- Is your vote count device.
- I did not know it was that bad.

107
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:52,979
All is not bad, they did not accept the
project but used it with great success,

108
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:56,800
- It is good for aging whiskey.
- Aging whiskey?

109
00:08:57,478 --> 00:09:00,188
It seems that is frying eggs.

110
00:09:00,228 --> 00:09:06,908
Just pass electricity through him and
in 10 minutes you whiskey 10 years.

111
00:09:08,436 --> 00:09:12,016
That's all over, it was my
first and last invention.

112
00:09:12,057 --> 00:09:13,537
You're not serious, Tom.

113
00:09:13,576 --> 00:09:16,396
That'll teach me not to invent
what people do not want.

114
00:09:16,645 --> 00:09:20,545
- Do not worry, get out of here.
- No, I want to stay in New York.

115
00:09:20,584 --> 00:09:23,104
You are not ready to settle down.

116
00:09:23,135 --> 00:09:24,845
You're the best telegrapher country.

117
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:27,650
Almost. You can get a job anywhere.

118
00:09:27,682 --> 00:09:31,032
- Then there's the phone.
- Even the telegraph needed.

119
00:09:31,064 --> 00:09:33,854
Take my advice and stay well.

120
00:09:34,297 --> 00:09:38,637
- Well, maybe...
- Your place is in San Francisco.

121
00:09:38,675 --> 00:09:40,855
San Francisco you need.

122
00:09:41,111 --> 00:09:45,461
- Here's a ticket.
- Thank you for the advice.

123
00:09:45,494 --> 00:09:48,474
Well, goodbye, Uncle Ben. If I
happen something you'll regret.

124
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,459
Well, you do not have any money?

125
00:09:55,575 --> 00:09:58,235
Help yourself.

126
00:09:58,603 --> 00:10:02,353
- I'll take the five.
- Are you sure you will not need more?

127
00:10:02,384 --> 00:10:06,454
No, this will suffice. Well, goodbye Tom.

128
00:10:06,493 --> 00:10:10,193
I leave you with Uncle Ben. You can
follow my steps, you'll be fine.

129
00:10:10,229 --> 00:10:13,899
Uncle Ben, if you hold that
whiskey, you can stay with him.

130
00:10:14,184 --> 00:10:15,904
Goodbye gentlemen, the world is beautiful

131
00:10:15,937 --> 00:10:18,077
we will find to enjoy it.

132
00:10:21,834 --> 00:10:27,214
- Take a friend, flee from me.
- No, not you, of that broom.

133
00:10:27,248 --> 00:10:28,358
¿Y entonces Mr. The?

134
00:10:28,648 --> 00:10:33,468
- I start where you left Bunt?
- You can help if you want.

135
00:10:33,868 --> 00:10:38,288
I offer bed and board, for a while.
Until you find work.

136
00:10:38,326 --> 00:10:39,836
Okay, thank you very much.

137
00:10:40,164 --> 00:10:43,914
Do you mind if I do a couple
of experiments while I'm here?

138
00:10:43,944 --> 00:10:46,464
- In the hours of rest.
- Yes, if you are careful.

139
00:10:46,858 --> 00:10:50,198
Come, we have much work. You know use that?

140
00:10:50,238 --> 00:10:53,548
Yes, I have invented - Then I disconnect.

141
00:11:04,391 --> 00:11:08,651
- This is the office of Mr. Taggart.
- Business is done here?

142
00:11:08,689 --> 00:11:11,839
I'm tired, let's get some rest.

143
00:11:12,201 --> 00:11:13,201
According.

144
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:22,053
- What is this thing?
- Than?

145
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:25,353
- What is this?
- Oh, that's a transmitter.

146
00:11:25,749 --> 00:11:28,259
Get gold prices and sent

147
00:11:28,299 --> 00:11:31,959
by this machine there to the
headquarters of shares.

148
00:11:32,244 --> 00:11:35,794
- Is not that wonderful?
- It's wonderful to work.

149
00:11:35,825 --> 00:11:37,895
I'd like Mr. Taggart.

150
00:11:38,141 --> 00:11:42,841
- When Mr. Taggart? To talk to him?
- Yes, why not?

151
00:11:42,878 --> 00:11:45,298
That's good to know Mr. Taggart.

152
00:11:45,513 --> 00:11:47,893
Anda, vamos a comer.

153
00:12:00,176 --> 00:12:01,646
How are you, Mr. Taggart?

154
00:12:04,081 --> 00:12:05,831
Do you look what you made me do?

155
00:12:06,552 --> 00:12:10,172
Mr. Taggart, nice to meet you!
A real pleasure.

156
00:12:11,095 --> 00:12:14,875
I will be brief, I know you do not
have much time and I did not.

157
00:12:14,915 --> 00:12:16,145
Coja un cigarro, Sr. Taggart.

158
00:12:19,303 --> 00:12:22,653
- If you do not mind smoke.
- Sit down please.

159
00:12:23,646 --> 00:12:25,996
So, Mr. Taggart, you have money and ideas.

160
00:12:26,032 --> 00:12:28,462
Together we form a great team.

161
00:12:28,787 --> 00:12:31,937
Sounds good boy, how much do you need?

162
00:12:31,969 --> 00:12:33,649
Well, not much, Mr. Taggart.

163
00:12:34,126 --> 00:12:40,176
Well, I'm a little low now.
How about $ 2 million?

164
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,680
- I removed it from my mouth.
- Enfold you or you send them?

165
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:49,419
Enough of this nonsense,
enough of this nonsense.

166
00:12:50,782 --> 00:12:55,322
I think I'll lie down a bit,
I'm not feeling very well.

167
00:12:56,082 --> 00:12:58,872
At this hour of the night
I start to be exhausted.

168
00:12:59,309 --> 00:13:01,939
Why not get some sleep? I
will clean the office.

169
00:13:02,258 --> 00:13:05,758
- You can eat a little.
- But it's your dinner.

170
00:13:05,793 --> 00:13:09,263
I'm not hungry. I am concerned with Bunt.

171
00:13:11,941 --> 00:13:14,571
I think I will not sleep tonight.

172
00:13:14,611 --> 00:13:17,041
Mr Els, you can not do two things at once.

173
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,180
If you want to sleep, sleep.
If you worry, stay awake.

174
00:13:27,003 --> 00:13:31,623
Listen, Mr. Els, Faraday
experiments with electricity.

175
00:13:32,223 --> 00:13:36,523
The aim of my research was the
turn magnetism into electricity.

176
00:13:36,805 --> 00:13:41,375
When I cut the current, I
got sparks among the coals.

177
00:13:41,746 --> 00:13:45,086
Now I have the embryo of electricity.

178
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:51,351
Rather discover new facts about
electromagnetic induction.

179
00:13:51,987 --> 00:13:55,457
That extol the importance
of those already obtained.

180
00:13:55,494 --> 00:13:58,394
With certain new discoveries in the future.

181
00:14:00,753 --> 00:14:02,983
In the future.

182
00:14:03,264 --> 00:14:04,614
That is now.

183
00:14:16,094 --> 00:14:18,324
- Have you seen the spark?
- Why do you think I jumped?

184
00:14:18,366 --> 00:14:20,076
It works, as the book said.

185
00:14:20,119 --> 00:14:22,469
You will burn the building
before you know it.

186
00:14:22,709 --> 00:14:25,339
No, Mr Els, is an experiment
with electricity.

187
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:28,439
¿Electricity? That's dangerous,
stop playing with it.

188
00:14:28,726 --> 00:14:32,226
How I will discover something if
it does not. He said he could.

189
00:14:32,267 --> 00:14:34,497
I will lose my job, do you want me fired?

190
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:40,591
No, Mr. Els, preferred to walk
the streets, rather than see it.

191
00:14:47,574 --> 00:14:50,494
It has been good to me. I'll go right away.

192
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:53,952
Wait. I did not say anything
that you need to go.

193
00:14:54,308 --> 00:14:57,618
I prefer leave before having him worried.

194
00:14:57,655 --> 00:15:00,045
No problem, but be careful. It's just that.

195
00:15:00,086 --> 00:15:04,026
Thank you. If this succeeds
everyone can use it.

196
00:15:04,065 --> 00:15:05,065
Worldwide.

197
00:15:05,385 --> 00:15:06,065
What is?

198
00:15:06,102 --> 00:15:09,082
A new form of light, something
that has never been seen before.

199
00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:11,329
Are you going to go crazy again?

200
00:15:11,362 --> 00:15:15,262
No sir. Of course I need
money for experiments.

201
00:15:15,626 --> 00:15:19,326
- Why not invent money?
- I want to get Mr. Taggart.

202
00:15:19,366 --> 00:15:22,616
I'm going to sell the idea
of ​​a new Notifier quotes.

203
00:15:22,651 --> 00:15:25,871
That will give me money to
continue my research on light.

204
00:15:25,901 --> 00:15:27,771
You know you can not see Mr. Taggart.

205
00:15:28,217 --> 00:15:31,477
You can see anyone if you try hard enough.

206
00:15:55,074 --> 00:15:57,504
- Yes, what do you want?
- You know that.

207
00:15:57,864 --> 00:16:01,324
The same as yesterday and before
yesterday, I see Mr. Taggart.

208
00:16:02,366 --> 00:16:05,146
You have to know you are
very busy to see you.

209
00:16:07,228 --> 00:16:10,168
Go and say Mr. Taggart I want to see it.

210
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,860
Close the door, I do not
want to be bothered.

211
00:16:21,891 --> 00:16:25,161
Sorry, but that Edison is crazy about him.

212
00:16:25,398 --> 00:16:27,468
I can not see anyone today called Edison.

213
00:16:27,505 --> 00:16:28,825
It is important, Mr. Taggart.

214
00:16:28,865 --> 00:16:30,925
See you next Christmas. Close the door.

215
00:16:36,157 --> 00:16:41,007
The next Christmas, Mr. Edison.

216
00:16:41,616 --> 00:16:43,096
Do you mind if I wait here?

217
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:47,310
The dollar has fallen more.
Midpoint and close more business.

218
00:16:50,023 --> 00:16:51,933
It is down another half point.

219
00:16:52,892 --> 00:16:57,232
- What time's dinner?
- Do not leave. They bring dinner.

220
00:17:03,332 --> 00:17:04,812
What is happening?

221
00:17:11,979 --> 00:17:16,119
- Give us the price!
- It has stopped.

222
00:17:16,482 --> 00:17:18,232
We're finished.

223
00:17:18,873 --> 00:17:20,223
What does it say?

224
00:17:20,466 --> 00:17:24,046
- Is jammed.
- Do something. I fix it.

225
00:17:31,265 --> 00:17:32,545
- Stay away.
- Over here please.

226
00:17:36,923 --> 00:17:39,553
- We are offline.
- I can fix it.

227
00:17:39,587 --> 00:17:42,177
- Get out of here.
- It's very simple. Very easy.

228
00:17:44,056 --> 00:17:46,876
Okay, Set it, but hurry and be careful.

229
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,890
How long will it take?

230
00:18:07,964 --> 00:18:11,504
- The spring was released pinion.
- What your name?

231
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:14,080
- Edison.
- Can you keep it running?

232
00:18:14,115 --> 00:18:16,485
- Yeah.
- What's his job, $ 300 per month.

233
00:18:16,526 --> 00:18:17,996
- How much?
- Is not that enough?

234
00:18:19,081 --> 00:18:22,381
If you win that money would
not have the courage to quit.

235
00:18:22,628 --> 00:18:23,738
What do you want?

236
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:26,772
I just want five minutes of your time.

237
00:18:32,828 --> 00:18:35,098
- Go to my office.
- Yes sir.

238
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:38,610
Wow, general.

239
00:18:38,646 --> 00:18:40,516
- Good afternoon.
- What agitation had?

240
00:18:40,758 --> 00:18:43,708
This man managed the indicator.
General Powell, Mr...

241
00:18:43,742 --> 00:18:44,742
Edison.

242
00:18:44,982 --> 00:18:47,722
¿El General Powell, presidente
de la Western Union?

243
00:18:48,807 --> 00:18:51,877
- I also wanted to see you.
- I have no objections.

244
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:53,670
We are the owners of that indicator.

245
00:18:59,486 --> 00:19:01,146
Merry Christmas.

246
00:19:06,698 --> 00:19:07,698
Thank you.

247
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:11,360
What kind of indicator
actions have in mind?

248
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:15,139
One to give gold prices
and the whole market.

249
00:19:15,345 --> 00:19:16,465
You think you can do that?

250
00:19:16,501 --> 00:19:18,451
Yes, I think I can, if I get the chance.

251
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:22,120
- A good cigar, you know?
- What kind of opportunity do you want?

252
00:19:22,478 --> 00:19:25,458
- The experiment.
- No time for that.

253
00:19:25,984 --> 00:19:30,044
Not with electricians, we have no
guarantee that their ideas work.

254
00:19:30,607 --> 00:19:33,317
Electricity is still a lot of theory.

255
00:19:33,356 --> 00:19:35,936
That's the problem, come to the
point, what use is electricity?

256
00:19:36,982 --> 00:19:39,282
What good is a newborn baby?

257
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,700
- Mr. Edison, you are wasting my time.
- As such, I will lose mine.

258
00:19:46,984 --> 00:19:48,774
Sit, wait a bit.

259
00:19:49,016 --> 00:19:52,876
Not progress putting anything
nervous and rushed us.

260
00:19:53,638 --> 00:19:54,638
Sit.

261
00:19:57,782 --> 00:20:00,412
You may want to use your
imagination, Taggart.

262
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:04,310
And you should have more patience and tact.

263
00:20:04,755 --> 00:20:08,615
Mr. Edison, I'm interested in
your thoughts on the indicator.

264
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:12,840
If you want to work, I will give
an opportunity to our workshop.

265
00:20:13,044 --> 00:20:17,344
- I'll buy whatever new and practical.
- Great, general.

266
00:20:17,905 --> 00:20:21,465
I just need a place to
work, tools and some men.

267
00:20:21,504 --> 00:20:25,044
Will all that, our clerk
will give you a letter.

268
00:20:25,396 --> 00:20:28,136
- Thank you very much sir.
- You are welcome.

269
00:20:52,173 --> 00:20:55,073
Sorry, I had not seen.

270
00:20:55,401 --> 00:20:57,111
It was nothing, have you hurt?

271
00:20:57,473 --> 00:21:01,013
Why these things are not easier to open?

272
00:21:01,314 --> 00:21:01,814
Excuse me.

273
00:21:01,816 --> 00:21:04,156
Why these things are not easier to open?

274
00:21:04,486 --> 00:21:07,146
- Maybe I can help.
- Thank you.

275
00:21:08,032 --> 00:21:09,862
- Do you work here?
- Yes, on the top floor.

276
00:21:10,264 --> 00:21:14,094
- I start down here today.
- What do you do?

277
00:21:14,124 --> 00:21:15,264
I am an inventor.

278
00:21:15,295 --> 00:21:16,395
Really?

279
00:21:17,835 --> 00:21:19,935
- But no invention umbrella.
- Anyone could see it.

280
00:21:44,771 --> 00:21:46,041
Damn.

281
00:21:52,502 --> 00:21:53,662
- Mr. Johnson?
- Yes.

282
00:21:53,692 --> 00:21:54,692
Soy Tom Edison.

283
00:21:59,754 --> 00:22:01,994
- The General Paul said...
- Charging explains it well.

284
00:22:04,057 --> 00:22:05,057
This way.

285
00:22:11,349 --> 00:22:14,249
It will work here, all
you need is available.

286
00:22:14,617 --> 00:22:15,647
Thank you, Mr. Johnson.

287
00:22:16,171 --> 00:22:18,201
We need to know the address of all staff.

288
00:22:18,482 --> 00:22:19,712
Where are you running?

289
00:22:20,076 --> 00:22:21,186
Right here.

290
00:22:21,391 --> 00:22:23,821
I mean, where is sleeping.

291
00:22:24,021 --> 00:22:26,571
Well, I'll sleep here for now.

292
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,110
Very good.

293
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:34,350
General Powell says he will be
paid the day of collection.

294
00:22:34,779 --> 00:22:37,049
He is very friendly, when we charge?

295
00:22:37,529 --> 00:22:38,879
Next Saturday.

296
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,660
- I'm Michael Simon.
- I'm Edison.

297
00:22:54,504 --> 00:22:57,254
- One is Mr. Ashton.
- How is it going?

298
00:22:57,288 --> 00:22:58,288
How is it going?

299
00:22:59,963 --> 00:23:03,233
What work do here, Mr. Edison?

300
00:23:03,389 --> 00:23:05,609
The first thing I will do
is to fix an umbrella.

301
00:23:33,753 --> 00:23:34,903
Excuse me, miss.

302
00:23:38,176 --> 00:23:39,516
Here's your umbrella.

303
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:41,320
Oh, it's you.

304
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,780
He has managed. It has been very good.

305
00:23:45,428 --> 00:23:46,538
Thank you.

306
00:23:47,102 --> 00:23:48,732
- Thank you.
- You are welcome.

307
00:23:53,118 --> 00:23:55,418
Drums well.

308
00:23:56,027 --> 00:23:59,167
- It's my job sir...
- Edison, Tom Edison.

309
00:24:01,725 --> 00:24:04,145
Mine is Mary Stillwell.

310
00:24:07,742 --> 00:24:11,042
- Lunchtime, I have hunger.
- Excuse me?

311
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:13,668
I'm hungry.

312
00:24:14,915 --> 00:24:17,695
- No he desayunado.
- Ni yo.

313
00:24:18,581 --> 00:24:21,011
I have much work to do before eating.

314
00:24:21,489 --> 00:24:23,599
- Goodbye, Miss Stillwell..
- Goodbye, Mr. Edison.

315
00:24:37,827 --> 00:24:40,937
How much is an apple pie
and a glass of milk?

316
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:43,240
- 10 cents.
- One such time.

317
00:25:04,325 --> 00:25:08,135
- I think we will eat together.
- Very good.

318
00:25:10,302 --> 00:25:12,972
When I returned to work I found that...

319
00:25:14,207 --> 00:25:16,947
- Will not you sit?
- Thank you.

320
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:23,889
I'll take the 35-cent menu.

321
00:25:27,875 --> 00:25:30,305
Come soon to be a big man.

322
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:32,490
Yes, that's right.

323
00:25:41,343 --> 00:25:45,453
- No Please.
- It's a pleasure Miss.

324
00:25:55,688 --> 00:25:59,668
This account of 45 cents, would
pagársela in a couple of days?

325
00:26:02,701 --> 00:26:04,211
No.

326
00:26:04,574 --> 00:26:07,164
Maybe you could come back later and pay?

327
00:26:07,881 --> 00:26:08,991
No.

328
00:26:11,985 --> 00:26:13,775
Sr. Edison.

329
00:26:14,017 --> 00:26:17,997
- You dropped something.
- Oh thanks.

330
00:26:22,266 --> 00:26:24,566
Funny, huh?

331
00:26:32,267 --> 00:26:36,637
- I heard not drop the dollar.
- I heard something, I looked and saw.

332
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:39,919
It's great to have someone around
like you to these situations.

333
00:26:39,953 --> 00:26:41,553
- Take cover from the rain.
- Yes Lady.

334
00:26:41,586 --> 00:26:45,926
He has earned his share of the umbrella.

335
00:26:58,885 --> 00:27:01,185
- Here's your money.
- Thank you.

336
00:27:03,866 --> 00:27:07,086
Mr. Simon, the money I owe
you, thank you very much.

337
00:27:07,128 --> 00:27:08,128
It is a pleasure.

338
00:27:08,369 --> 00:27:11,079
- Thanks, Bob.
- You are welcome.

339
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:16,940
- I'm ready for that now.
- How many machines will do?

340
00:27:16,971 --> 00:27:19,441
- Just one.
- There are sketches for a dozen.

341
00:27:19,486 --> 00:27:21,116
If it works, I'll be satisfied.

342
00:27:21,154 --> 00:27:22,124
I will give some men.

343
00:27:22,156 --> 00:27:24,706
Mr. Johnson, if you do not mind
I'd like to pick them myself.

344
00:27:25,025 --> 00:27:26,165
Of course.

345
00:27:35,425 --> 00:27:37,685
I think Mr. Simon is not very original.

346
00:27:37,935 --> 00:27:39,645
I think that is right.

347
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:41,546
Very good.

348
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:54,308
It's too hard.

349
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:56,540
Maybe I can do better.

350
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:00,400
Anyone can recognize a rotten
egg without having put.

351
00:28:06,147 --> 00:28:08,177
I think he's right.

352
00:28:09,255 --> 00:28:12,595
Graham, Lingstrom, Bigelow,
preséntense al Sr. Edison.

353
00:28:14,395 --> 00:28:18,255
I would like to make some models
of these sketches. Try this.

354
00:28:18,579 --> 00:28:19,579
Of course.

355
00:28:19,934 --> 00:28:21,494
Do you think he'll like?

356
00:28:21,807 --> 00:28:25,097
I think that will get an incorrigible
womanizer not out overnight.

357
00:28:25,433 --> 00:28:26,993
To work, boys.

358
00:28:29,258 --> 00:28:31,318
Want to try it?

359
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:34,319
Thank you, I prefer to
work for the company.

360
00:28:34,637 --> 00:28:37,627
All right. I think I'll try it myself.

361
00:28:37,666 --> 00:28:40,446
Simon, sorry but you'll have to do without.

362
00:28:46,273 --> 00:28:47,903
Do you have any other job?

363
00:28:48,345 --> 00:28:49,345
No.

364
00:28:50,297 --> 00:28:52,957
I'm sure you can do this.

365
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:58,311
I will do what I can.

366
00:28:58,466 --> 00:29:01,216
Do you care to stay and
work awhile tonight?

367
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:03,360
I have a very important thing to do.

368
00:29:03,566 --> 00:29:05,826
- No, I did not care.
- Thank you.

369
00:29:32,375 --> 00:29:33,375
What are you doing?

370
00:29:33,412 --> 00:29:35,552
I am inviting a lady to dinner with me.

371
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:47,830
- What did you say?
- You would love. Want to try?

372
00:29:52,339 --> 00:29:55,919
It's been a wonderful night.
Dinner, the concert...

373
00:29:56,363 --> 00:29:59,473
- I did not know you liked music.
- If it is simple, yes.

374
00:30:00,747 --> 00:30:02,967
Look what a nice sofa.

375
00:30:03,536 --> 00:30:07,676
If he could see better.
When illuminated windows

376
00:30:07,715 --> 00:30:09,170
with electric lamps themselves
that you can see well.

377
00:30:09,194 --> 00:30:13,464
I What is electricity? One year
work she does not know what is.

378
00:30:13,936 --> 00:30:15,486
Nobody knows.

379
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:18,789
A friend told me it was like a dachshund,

380
00:30:19,036 --> 00:30:21,826
long enough to reach from
Edinburgh to London.

381
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,810
Edinburgh tail and barks in London.

382
00:30:24,615 --> 00:30:27,125
Nobody knows what goes through
the dog and into the cable.

383
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,070
There are also people electricity.

384
00:30:29,436 --> 00:30:32,616
Sometimes I have so much in
hair can not comb my hair.

385
00:30:32,903 --> 00:30:35,963
Really? Well, it does not look at him.

386
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:39,750
Perhaps you are a human drummer,
we're going to do some tests.

387
00:30:41,988 --> 00:30:45,928
- It's what you are, a human battery.
- Have I given current?

388
00:30:46,132 --> 00:30:54,102
Not exactly, give me your hand. You
are full of electricity. I noticed.

389
00:30:55,138 --> 00:30:56,898
You better get going.

390
00:30:56,931 --> 00:31:00,551
This is a scientific experiment.
Theoretically, electricity

391
00:31:00,588 --> 00:31:04,178
always travels in the same direction,
from positive to negative.

392
00:31:04,781 --> 00:31:07,291
Positive negative.

393
00:31:09,562 --> 00:31:11,282
There is a fault somewhere.

394
00:31:11,316 --> 00:31:14,256
- You are the positive, right?
- Very positive.

395
00:31:14,503 --> 00:31:18,403
- Does that make me be negative?
- I hope not.

396
00:31:21,476 --> 00:31:24,816
Someone always interferes with science.

397
00:31:30,721 --> 00:31:31,881
Really the machine work?

398
00:31:31,916 --> 00:31:35,886
At least work at 4 in the
morning when I left.

399
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:38,930
And he had ten weeks. Now you'll see.

400
00:31:40,683 --> 00:31:42,753
Come, come. I'll show you.

401
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:48,409
Observador.

402
00:31:56,861 --> 00:31:58,371
Wait, wait.

403
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,630
Sr. Edison.

404
00:32:04,153 --> 00:32:05,153
Sr. Edison.

405
00:32:05,308 --> 00:32:08,288
- I do not know, is not working.
- It does not work?

406
00:32:08,536 --> 00:32:10,986
Strange, it should work.

407
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:20,929
- Congratulations. Good job.
- All right, Tom.

408
00:32:20,968 --> 00:32:24,348
- We did not think I would get it.
- What does it mean to us?

409
00:32:24,594 --> 00:32:27,304
Mr. Edison, an excellent job.

410
00:32:27,339 --> 00:32:28,699
Thank you. What time is it?

411
00:32:28,977 --> 00:32:29,577
The seven.

412
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:32,325
God, I must be in New York at 9.

413
00:32:32,364 --> 00:32:35,207
- We have time.
- Somebody put my hat.

414
00:32:35,208 --> 00:32:35,708
Of course.

415
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:38,650
Here we go guys.

416
00:32:48,702 --> 00:32:49,702
Tom.

417
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:54,310
- Do you think they'll like?
- Sure you will like.

418
00:32:55,276 --> 00:32:58,096
- How do you think I should ask?
- How much do you think it?

419
00:32:58,663 --> 00:33:01,413
I do not know. I would
take two thousand dollars.

420
00:33:01,971 --> 00:33:04,641
Let me make you an offer
before saying anything.

421
00:33:04,675 --> 00:33:05,675
Good idea.

422
00:33:06,912 --> 00:33:09,862
You think you're nothing
but wood metal and glass.

423
00:33:10,338 --> 00:33:14,158
Not so, you're dreams, hard work and faith.

424
00:33:14,602 --> 00:33:18,222
- Do not let us down.
- Thanks for telling us.

425
00:33:20,021 --> 00:33:22,401
Good luck, Tom.

426
00:33:28,389 --> 00:33:30,059
Tom.

427
00:33:44,328 --> 00:33:46,748
- What do you think?
- He did it.

428
00:33:47,037 --> 00:33:48,667
It works.

429
00:33:49,827 --> 00:33:51,137
It looks like it is.

430
00:33:53,373 --> 00:33:56,273
Are you interested in running a
factory to build these devices?

431
00:33:56,561 --> 00:33:58,541
No, sir, would sell.

432
00:33:58,832 --> 00:34:01,782
- There are other things I want to do.
- What are those things?

433
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:05,840
Well, I teach is the
General when it sees fit.

434
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:10,424
- I like to smoke cigars here.
- I'm associated with the General,

435
00:34:10,707 --> 00:34:12,357
- So let's talk business.
- I'm ready.

436
00:34:12,394 --> 00:34:14,014
How much you want to machine the bag?

437
00:34:17,162 --> 00:34:20,622
How think it would be fair?

438
00:34:20,947 --> 00:34:23,807
What do you think $ 20,000?

439
00:34:27,323 --> 00:34:30,353
- How much?
- I said $ 20,000.

440
00:34:31,507 --> 00:34:33,487
$ 20,000...

441
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:38,075
Well, I... 20.000, I...

442
00:34:38,121 --> 00:34:43,621
Perhaps a reasonable price to be $ 30,000.

443
00:34:45,453 --> 00:34:48,513
- 30,000?
- Yes, 30,000.

444
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:53,410
- Well, I...
- That are 40,000.

445
00:34:53,861 --> 00:34:57,731
With rights and everything,
I think it's fair.

446
00:34:58,164 --> 00:35:01,704
Yes, General, I think it's fair.

447
00:35:02,747 --> 00:35:07,447
General, before making the
check, you beat me some money.

448
00:35:07,484 --> 00:35:09,274
$ 215 in cash.

449
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:15,290
106.23 in material, that
adds $ 321 and 23 cents.

450
00:35:16,095 --> 00:35:18,115
Are you sure that's right?

451
00:35:18,526 --> 00:35:20,396
Yes sir. I am.

452
00:35:20,837 --> 00:35:22,057
Very good.

453
00:35:22,869 --> 00:35:24,539
Well, forget it.

454
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,810
Thank you sir.

455
00:35:27,093 --> 00:35:30,913
- What will I do with all that money?
- I'll tell you what I will do.

456
00:35:31,197 --> 00:35:34,417
- I will not buy shares in gas.
- Well, there are worse things.

457
00:35:34,704 --> 00:35:36,774
I doubt it, Mr. Taggart.

458
00:35:37,015 --> 00:35:40,875
Here are the papers of the patent.
Now is yours.

459
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:44,809
- Thank you.
- You are welcome bye.

460
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:49,250
Wait, do not be too cheerful.

461
00:35:49,288 --> 00:35:56,098
You may want to know that we
were willing to go to $ 60,000.

462
00:35:57,496 --> 00:36:00,836
- Really?
- Yes.

463
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:05,780
Perhaps you may be wondering who
was willing to sell it for 2,000.

464
00:36:15,428 --> 00:36:18,808
Mr Edison, how has it gone? - Calm
down, I'll tell you everything later.

465
00:36:35,192 --> 00:36:36,742
What he has been sold.

466
00:36:42,284 --> 00:36:44,474
$ 40,000.

467
00:36:52,645 --> 00:36:55,195
He says "will you marry me?".

468
00:36:57,904 --> 00:37:01,174
She says, "Yes, Tom."

469
00:37:07,069 --> 00:37:09,699
He says, "low right now."

470
00:37:15,517 --> 00:37:17,937
She says, "right now".

471
00:37:19,501 --> 00:37:23,161
- Congratulations!
- Be happy!

472
00:37:23,247 --> 00:37:26,747
Mr. Edison, I would like
to work with you anywhere.

473
00:37:26,789 --> 00:37:27,789
Of course, of course.

474
00:37:35,958 --> 00:37:40,018
Congratulations...

475
00:37:48,988 --> 00:37:51,098
Well, what are you waiting for?

476
00:37:52,734 --> 00:37:55,444
Well, what are we waiting for?

477
00:39:29,243 --> 00:39:32,153
- Congratulations, Mr. Edison.
- A boy.

478
00:39:32,187 --> 00:39:33,187
All right, Tom.

479
00:39:33,387 --> 00:39:37,367
- First a girl, now a child.
- One of two things had to be.

480
00:39:37,651 --> 00:39:39,561
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

481
00:39:41,436 --> 00:39:42,826
Thank you.

482
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:47,530
- Do not smoke cigars?
- Yes, but I'll save it for another day.

483
00:39:49,406 --> 00:39:52,826
Take another Monday. There is more to each.

484
00:39:53,072 --> 00:39:54,672
- Thanks again.
- Thanks, Tom.

485
00:39:54,705 --> 00:39:56,345
It is not known when it can happen again.

486
00:39:56,578 --> 00:39:59,798
It may not be until next year.

487
00:40:02,276 --> 00:40:06,016
- More? You eat a lot.
- Tom, are almost nine.

488
00:40:06,057 --> 00:40:09,087
- Really?
- You're spoiling the child.

489
00:40:09,125 --> 00:40:10,965
What parent does not pamper his child?

490
00:40:11,003 --> 00:40:13,403
You late to the workshop three
times what your people think?

491
00:40:13,553 --> 00:40:17,823
Have patience with me. True?
It is not like this?

492
00:40:19,809 --> 00:40:24,069
They will take it in stride. Dad
has to work to buy more soup.

493
00:40:24,108 --> 00:40:26,188
I'll have to rush you.

494
00:40:26,224 --> 00:40:29,174
It has been a pleasure to see.
Visit us when you pass by.

495
00:40:29,208 --> 00:40:31,598
Here, you eat alone.

496
00:40:31,883 --> 00:40:34,553
- Bye sweetheart.
- Goodbye.

497
00:40:36,146 --> 00:40:40,996
Goodbye, Tom. Say goodbye.
Say goodbye. Well.

498
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,870
Go Mr Els, But, how are you?

499
00:40:46,148 --> 00:40:49,128
- Are and seven o'clock?
- Well, it was seven.

500
00:40:49,296 --> 00:40:51,996
Yes, two days ago. What kind
of entrepreneur are you?

501
00:40:52,205 --> 00:40:54,705
- What have you been doing?
- I was feeding the baby.

502
00:40:55,034 --> 00:41:00,094
The wheels of industry
have to stop for a baby.

503
00:41:00,294 --> 00:41:04,244
- They are not stops. You can hear them.
- Refers to yours,

504
00:41:04,273 --> 00:41:05,273
Is not that right, But?

505
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:11,200
- It's no use. I'm broke.
- But you look so good.

506
00:41:11,411 --> 00:41:12,441
Did you say broke?

507
00:41:12,686 --> 00:41:14,706
- Really?
- Practically.

508
00:41:14,758 --> 00:41:18,438
It can not be, you are an
important businessman.

509
00:41:18,473 --> 00:41:22,123
You have a laboratory, wife
and children, all that.

510
00:41:22,767 --> 00:41:24,827
I just need five dollars.

511
00:41:25,078 --> 00:41:28,028
See if you can get ten and give me five.

512
00:41:28,585 --> 00:41:32,005
But at least you could
have let me finish hello.

513
00:41:33,765 --> 00:41:36,825
There must be a leak in your company.
Problem of accounting.

514
00:41:37,072 --> 00:41:38,862
There are the books.

515
00:41:39,543 --> 00:41:42,173
- Books, I see none.
- There you have.

516
00:41:42,531 --> 00:41:46,801
I owe bills, invoices to
be me, or vice versa.

517
00:41:46,835 --> 00:41:50,055
- But that's it in a nutshell.
- In a nutshell.

518
00:41:50,097 --> 00:41:51,287
Come here and take a look.

519
00:41:52,095 --> 00:41:57,145
- No wonder you are insolvent.
- Insolvent? Better than ruined.

520
00:41:57,354 --> 00:41:59,914
But it means the same thing, right?

521
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:11,260
It has a nice home here, Tom.

522
00:42:12,098 --> 00:42:14,918
I just wanted to show you
where the money I invest.

523
00:42:17,477 --> 00:42:19,077
- Good morning, Michael.
- Good Morning.

524
00:42:20,067 --> 00:42:21,937
This the Jack, any progress?

525
00:42:22,259 --> 00:42:24,639
I have it. This time I have.

526
00:42:25,048 --> 00:42:26,208
I just need some more days.

527
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:28,673
Well, all right, I knew you
could do it, continues as well.

528
00:42:29,272 --> 00:42:32,492
Wonderful, I never thought I'd get.

529
00:42:32,738 --> 00:42:35,268
- What has been achieved?
- Of course, that's what he said.

530
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,974
He has not achieved anything but I
like to hear you talk like that.

531
00:42:37,998 --> 00:42:40,418
Tom, here comes the sheriff.

532
00:42:43,776 --> 00:42:46,516
The sheriff in person.
I'd better evaporate.

533
00:42:51,825 --> 00:42:54,045
Busco a Thomas Edison.

534
00:43:08,362 --> 00:43:11,072
- Who here is Tom Edison?
- Can I help you?

535
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:14,050
Of course yes, Mr. Edison,
here I have an auto claim.

536
00:43:14,339 --> 00:43:15,459
What does that mean?

537
00:43:15,494 --> 00:43:18,564
It is a lawsuit to recover
a property held illegally.

538
00:43:18,802 --> 00:43:21,782
- Like what?
- As this machinery unpaid.

539
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:24,820
Do not worry about it, sheriff.

540
00:43:24,858 --> 00:43:26,998
I'll take care of these
things earlier this month.

541
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:29,480
He has not dealt with
them, there's the rub.

542
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:32,339
I will have missed some details.

543
00:43:32,589 --> 00:43:35,729
- This is a garnishment order.
- Oh, that's another story.

544
00:43:35,976 --> 00:43:39,166
You have one week to pay

545
00:43:39,203 --> 00:43:40,483
all this machinery or be seized.

546
00:43:40,638 --> 00:43:42,478
I understand, did a paper anymore?

547
00:43:42,511 --> 00:43:47,171
A summons to justify why
have not executed yet.

548
00:43:47,332 --> 00:43:50,002
That does not work. It has given the claim.

549
00:43:50,161 --> 00:43:53,111
No, this garnishment
overrides everything else.

550
00:43:53,269 --> 00:43:57,289
- I understand, and is it true?
- Should, how would I know?

551
00:43:57,413 --> 00:44:00,603
Maybe you need a habeas-corpus.
Everything else has.

552
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,510
- You drink?
- Yes, but I'm sober now.

553
00:44:03,669 --> 00:44:08,199
I also go somewhere where
I can invite a drink.

554
00:44:08,411 --> 00:44:13,621
Yes, that's a good idea. I never
discuss anything without a drink.

555
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:16,340
Nothing like a drink to clear his mind.

556
00:44:17,297 --> 00:44:20,237
Mr. Edison I've also
done a little invention.

557
00:44:20,445 --> 00:44:23,735
- Magnificent, is it child?
- No, I do not mean that.

558
00:44:41,723 --> 00:44:45,153
Tom, Tom, the sheriff is gone.

559
00:44:47,541 --> 00:44:49,331
I am an ostrich.

560
00:44:49,533 --> 00:44:52,203
Whenever I have problems
I put my head here.

561
00:44:54,833 --> 00:44:56,543
I do not know why I laugh.

562
00:44:57,224 --> 00:44:58,894
We have problems.

563
00:44:59,096 --> 00:45:03,706
Incidentally, the sheriff said
you have one week to pay.

564
00:45:03,918 --> 00:45:04,978
One week.

565
00:45:05,392 --> 00:45:06,582
One week.

566
00:45:06,867 --> 00:45:10,727
In a week it can destroy what
it took five years to build.

567
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:15,110
It's a shame, you must have a
fortune invested in the laboratory.

568
00:45:15,354 --> 00:45:19,134
No matter the money, but
the lives involved in it.

569
00:45:19,657 --> 00:45:23,557
That's all I swore to do in life
and the weekly pay of my men.

570
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:27,460
Means, house, shelter, clothing,
food for many families.

571
00:45:28,583 --> 00:45:31,133
A week can not destroy everything.

572
00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:35,670
Uncle Ben, I have to do something.
And I accept suggestions.

573
00:45:36,592 --> 00:45:39,782
- Are you kidding, Tom?
- I would be.

574
00:45:40,099 --> 00:45:44,439
- I had never asked for advice.
- Then you must have many.

575
00:45:45,757 --> 00:45:51,447
Well, if I were you, with
inventor and all that,

576
00:45:53,169 --> 00:45:55,119
then he invents something.

577
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:59,890
Invent something quick? So all of a sudden?

578
00:46:00,102 --> 00:46:03,532
- Yes, and the sooner the better.
- Can I suggest something?

579
00:46:04,047 --> 00:46:06,907
What about the light you
were always talking about?

580
00:46:07,075 --> 00:46:09,895
That running on electricity, you remember?

581
00:46:10,064 --> 00:46:11,254
If I remember.

582
00:46:11,459 --> 00:46:15,359
I think it's time that invent.

583
00:46:15,563 --> 00:46:21,733
But always says nonsense, but when he
speaks of that light, it seems reasonable.

584
00:46:22,058 --> 00:46:25,078
Do not give more laps, Tom.
If you could invent that.

585
00:46:25,285 --> 00:46:27,465
Yes, if I could invent that.

586
00:46:31,462 --> 00:46:34,442
- Uncle Ben, would you do something for me?
- Of course, Tom.

587
00:46:35,446 --> 00:46:37,886
Can you tell my wife did not dine at home?

588
00:46:37,926 --> 00:46:40,336
And maybe I will not be
home for breakfast coffee.

589
00:46:41,344 --> 00:46:44,534
I'll stay here and work in that light.

590
00:47:19,437 --> 00:47:20,707
¡Tom!

591
00:47:28,204 --> 00:47:30,504
- Hola, Mary.
- Tom, mírate.

592
00:47:31,113 --> 00:47:34,303
- If you took it over, it would be great.
- Do not you think you should rest?

593
00:47:34,539 --> 00:47:38,159
- I can not stop now.
- You've been locked up four days.

594
00:47:38,843 --> 00:47:41,673
Children do not even ask about you.

595
00:47:41,871 --> 00:47:44,381
You have to rest and eat.

596
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:48,320
I took some milk and apple pie.

597
00:47:48,645 --> 00:47:50,755
- It was yesterday.
- I have to work.

598
00:47:50,792 --> 00:47:52,342
That may not be so important.

599
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:55,690
It is more important to me
than anything in the world.

600
00:47:57,571 --> 00:48:01,391
Nothing is more important than
health, you are destroying.

601
00:48:02,392 --> 00:48:04,342
Come home with me.

602
00:48:04,704 --> 00:48:06,454
- Please.
- Leave me alone.

603
00:48:06,855 --> 00:48:09,165
Leave me alone, I'm working,
you're interrupting me.

604
00:48:09,201 --> 00:48:10,961
Do I need your permission to do my job?

605
00:48:10,994 --> 00:48:12,354
You're not working,
you're killing yourself.

606
00:48:12,357 --> 00:48:12,857
According.

607
00:48:12,859 --> 00:48:15,419
- Please leave me alone.
- All right, Tom.

608
00:48:28,134 --> 00:48:29,284
Come in.

609
00:48:32,716 --> 00:48:34,506
- Tom.
- Yes?

610
00:48:34,549 --> 00:48:37,499
I do not understand these specifications.

611
00:48:37,856 --> 00:48:40,436
This clay, what kind of clay is?

612
00:48:40,805 --> 00:48:43,145
White, ordinary clay. Wrap the wire in it.

613
00:48:43,435 --> 00:48:46,015
- Okay, now I see.
- Michael.

614
00:48:48,097 --> 00:48:52,627
Suppose that the workshop should
become another, would it matter?

615
00:48:52,918 --> 00:48:55,498
Not for us, as long as you follow with us.

616
00:48:56,943 --> 00:48:59,163
Suppose I admit to General
Powell as a partner.

617
00:48:59,493 --> 00:49:01,723
And of course, Mr. Taggart.

618
00:49:02,442 --> 00:49:04,152
Good.

619
00:49:04,793 --> 00:49:06,943
If you have to do that...

620
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:10,250
It seems to me well.

621
00:49:11,089 --> 00:49:12,749
That's it, Michael.

622
00:49:20,333 --> 00:49:23,873
- Only 1 minute or 2, please.
- I did not know it was so.

623
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:26,379
Is very sick.

624
00:49:39,141 --> 00:49:41,491
- Hi Tom!
- Hello, General.

625
00:49:42,488 --> 00:49:46,388
- I'm glad you came.
- It would have been before you know it.

626
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:49,810
Why the secrecy? Why do not
you want your friends know?

627
00:49:50,059 --> 00:49:53,159
- Everything is alright?
- All right.

628
00:49:54,203 --> 00:49:57,503
- Really?
- Really. Everything goes smoothly.

629
00:49:57,749 --> 00:50:00,209
Money grows like a grain
of corn on the cob.

630
00:50:00,658 --> 00:50:03,158
Taggart saw the other day.

631
00:50:03,766 --> 00:50:07,586
He said something about helping.

632
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:10,130
Help me? No need for help.

633
00:50:11,377 --> 00:50:14,667
Do not rely too much on Taggart.

634
00:50:15,003 --> 00:50:18,063
Do not worry about that,
generally, and get good soon.

635
00:50:19,665 --> 00:50:21,735
I'm doing what I can, Tom.

636
00:50:21,777 --> 00:50:25,277
I want to be here when
he invented the light.

637
00:50:27,874 --> 00:50:30,904
- That light.
- It will be, General.

638
00:50:39,868 --> 00:50:44,758
It seems that General Powell
will take time to recover.

639
00:50:45,327 --> 00:50:49,747
Anyway, I can not wait that long.
I need the money immediately.

640
00:50:49,989 --> 00:50:52,809
Okay, Mr. Edison. How
much money do you need?

641
00:50:53,575 --> 00:50:59,025
- It is a considerable sum.
- No matter, no matter at all.

642
00:50:59,313 --> 00:51:01,703
General Powell believes that
you are a man with a future.

643
00:51:01,739 --> 00:51:03,999
If the general believe in a person, me too.

644
00:51:04,214 --> 00:51:05,484
What's your number?

645
00:51:05,848 --> 00:51:10,108
$ 50,000.

646
00:51:11,347 --> 00:51:13,407
Bucks? 50,000.

647
00:51:15,053 --> 00:51:18,483
Suppose I give you $ 100,000.

648
00:51:18,918 --> 00:51:21,138
- 100,000?
- That's.

649
00:51:21,587 --> 00:51:26,637
- I do not need much.
- Do not know what the future will bring.

650
00:51:27,086 --> 00:51:31,376
At the moment I am able to give
you a check for $ 100,000.

651
00:51:32,266 --> 00:51:35,286
That's great, wonderful.

652
00:51:35,454 --> 00:51:37,294
I would like to express how happy I am.

653
00:51:37,322 --> 00:51:38,562
Is nothing. Is nothing.

654
00:51:38,761 --> 00:51:43,061
I can do experiments for
3 years without worry.

655
00:51:43,344 --> 00:51:48,014
Of course, if you pay the money,
I hope to have some authority

656
00:51:48,041 --> 00:51:51,191
to decide the type of work that
has to be done in Meldo Park.

657
00:51:53,106 --> 00:51:54,546
Not that.

658
00:51:54,581 --> 00:51:58,401
Do not misunderstand me,
I just want the right to

659
00:51:58,645 --> 00:52:02,615
make sure that everything
is made profitable.

660
00:52:02,909 --> 00:52:06,379
It is a small step in securing
my money, if you please.

661
00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:07,410
Well, I do care.

662
00:52:08,009 --> 00:52:11,359
I am an inventor, you can not tell me
what I should do. I do what I want.

663
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:13,741
Working ideas, visionary realities.

664
00:52:13,986 --> 00:52:16,746
I do not even know how useful
or profitable they can be

665
00:52:16,786 --> 00:52:19,516
if any been able to implement my way.

666
00:52:21,199 --> 00:52:24,779
It is not in a position to
demand do things his way.

667
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:27,490
Yes it's correct.

668
00:52:28,172 --> 00:52:31,472
And you want to take advantage of it.
He wants to chain.

669
00:52:33,033 --> 00:52:35,063
Piénselo bien, Sr. Edison.

670
00:52:35,145 --> 00:52:38,565
No, it will not be necessary, I do
not want your money at this price.

671
00:52:39,249 --> 00:52:42,939
I prefer to wait until General
Powell is able to speak.

672
00:52:43,314 --> 00:52:44,664
Very good.

673
00:52:50,366 --> 00:52:52,996
Mr. Edison, General Paul is dead.

674
00:53:19,495 --> 00:53:22,865
This could be a good time
to sit down and mourn.

675
00:53:23,878 --> 00:53:26,428
But we will not because
that would get us nowhere.

676
00:53:26,866 --> 00:53:30,206
I know we've had problems before but

677
00:53:30,851 --> 00:53:35,111
at the last moment always it appeared
something that allowed us to continue.

678
00:53:36,509 --> 00:53:40,089
Do you remember the chemical telegraph?
It was a fluke.

679
00:53:40,494 --> 00:53:43,874
And the quadruplex and electric pen?

680
00:53:44,279 --> 00:53:48,179
These things were when we most needed.

681
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:51,840
But this time nothing happened.

682
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:57,267
Maybe I've been waiting for a miracle.
In any case, it has not happened.

683
00:53:58,266 --> 00:54:01,166
And I have more time.

684
00:54:01,533 --> 00:54:03,763
We are left penniless.

685
00:54:04,721 --> 00:54:06,071
Y...

686
00:54:06,275 --> 00:54:09,375
Forgive me for saying so, but.

687
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:11,500
You're fired.

688
00:54:11,535 --> 00:54:15,275
Wait a few days, Tom, I know what
will solve the new telegraph.

689
00:54:15,315 --> 00:54:16,985
Thank you, Jack, but we can not wait.

690
00:54:17,352 --> 00:54:19,942
You need money to live and I also.

691
00:54:20,182 --> 00:54:27,032
And we have nothing, except
that I have to indemnizaros.

692
00:54:27,394 --> 00:54:30,664
- Tom, I can say only one word?
- Do not.

693
00:54:31,897 --> 00:54:33,957
The less said the better.

694
00:54:35,044 --> 00:54:40,104
Boys, I want to thank you for
everything you did for me.

695
00:54:42,217 --> 00:54:44,037
Pay them. That is all.

696
00:55:16,286 --> 00:55:18,186
Santa has arrived.

697
00:55:44,617 --> 00:55:45,837
Hi Tom.

698
00:55:51,830 --> 00:55:52,830
Hi Tom.

699
00:55:53,583 --> 00:55:55,173
Hello Mary.

700
00:55:57,966 --> 00:56:00,706
I think I need not say I'm sorry, right?

701
00:56:01,712 --> 00:56:03,262
I do not know.

702
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:06,210
You can try.

703
00:56:08,326 --> 00:56:10,666
Do you mind if I try it tomorrow?

704
00:56:10,996 --> 00:56:13,336
I'm tired.

705
00:56:14,742 --> 00:56:17,652
- Tom, we have something to discuss.
- Not now, dear.

706
00:56:17,685 --> 00:56:18,835
Yes, right now, Tom.

707
00:56:20,519 --> 00:56:23,339
I know what it means to you that light.

708
00:56:23,667 --> 00:56:28,197
I want the truth, do you have anything
real or are too stubborn to give up?

709
00:56:28,568 --> 00:56:31,748
- It is very real to me, Mary.
- But you're right?

710
00:56:32,195 --> 00:56:34,495
Is the rest of the world is wrong?

711
00:56:34,785 --> 00:56:37,805
Is there any possibility
that you get to discover?

712
00:56:39,805 --> 00:56:42,625
Can we talk about it in the morning, Mary?

713
00:56:43,631 --> 00:56:45,741
Okay, Tom.

714
00:56:46,181 --> 00:56:47,371
In the morning.

715
00:57:06,104 --> 00:57:07,104
Tom.

716
00:57:19,214 --> 00:57:21,324
Well, I've fallen asleep.

717
00:57:23,438 --> 00:57:25,548
Have I slept here all night?

718
00:57:29,494 --> 00:57:32,004
¿Me has tapado?

719
00:57:32,403 --> 00:57:34,633
I could not let you resfriaras, Tom.

720
00:57:37,145 --> 00:57:41,485
- Now let's talk about it.
- Why? I had a nice dream.

721
00:57:42,564 --> 00:57:44,834
He was dreaming of winter.

722
00:57:45,194 --> 00:57:48,064
It was so cold that the
trees were not moving.

723
00:57:48,342 --> 00:57:51,562
And the dawn quickly
froze while trying dawn.

724
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:56,711
Yes, all the frozen universe.

725
00:57:57,348 --> 00:58:01,718
He doubted between following warm in
bed or out to see what was happening.

726
00:58:02,647 --> 00:58:06,907
I get up. I saw that the earth was
frozen and no longer spinning.

727
00:58:07,588 --> 00:58:09,298
Everything was dark.

728
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:15,240
The sun was trapped
between two walls of ice.

729
00:58:15,837 --> 00:58:20,177
He struggled to free his
own sweat froze both.

730
00:58:22,172 --> 00:58:26,272
I started to walk the earth and see
what could be done and found a bear.

731
00:58:26,874 --> 00:58:30,434
I told him what had
happened and began to jump

732
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:34,080
so hard it began to sweat
hot oil over his head.

733
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:40,529
Then I grabbed the bear and
placed on the axis of the earth.

734
00:58:40,781 --> 00:58:43,411
And I left the hot oil
to slide on the shaft.

735
00:58:43,849 --> 00:58:49,819
Then I kicked the pinion of
the land and got rid the sun.

736
00:58:50,224 --> 00:58:55,204
The earth groaned and began to
move and the sun began to shine.

737
00:59:01,661 --> 00:59:06,161
I lit my pipe with fire,
I split a piece for me.

738
00:59:07,917 --> 00:59:11,607
And I went walking home
with sunshine in my pocket.

739
00:59:12,698 --> 00:59:15,158
Oh, Tom, that's nice.

740
00:59:15,727 --> 00:59:20,067
Continue your work, go
ahead with your light.

741
00:59:20,349 --> 00:59:23,609
Do not listen to anyone
who tries to stop you.

742
00:59:23,815 --> 00:59:27,075
I do not even listen to
me if I blame something.

743
00:59:27,521 --> 00:59:32,341
Nothing will happen to us while
you're able to dream like.

744
00:59:36,288 --> 00:59:40,268
Well, Mary, perhaps he
has not dreamed exactly.

745
00:59:41,268 --> 00:59:46,198
Perhaps I remembered an old
story my mother told me.

746
00:59:46,409 --> 00:59:51,309
I prefer to be a dream. Let it remain so.

747
00:59:51,708 --> 00:59:53,898
Okay, if you feel better as well.

748
00:59:56,689 --> 00:59:57,689
Thank you.

749
00:59:59,239 --> 01:00:01,949
I think I always carry
two heads of advantage.

750
01:01:36,346 --> 01:01:38,856
I said you need a harder spring,
how much I have to repeat

751
01:01:38,892 --> 01:01:40,212
so that you can understand me?

752
01:01:47,862 --> 01:01:49,732
Any progress with the telegraph repeat?

753
01:01:49,934 --> 01:01:51,414
Not yet, but we will.

754
01:01:54,756 --> 01:01:55,896
¡Tom!

755
01:02:07,148 --> 01:02:08,778
Hey, do not mess with that.

756
01:02:11,213 --> 01:02:13,723
- Sorry, Tom.
- Does not matter.

757
01:02:19,660 --> 01:02:21,450
Since then he has assembled quite a stir.

758
01:02:22,011 --> 01:02:23,841
I never heard a noise like that.

759
01:02:29,502 --> 01:02:32,852
There seems a clang. It seems
that comes from the disk.

760
01:02:33,168 --> 01:02:34,678
Very strange.

761
01:03:10,545 --> 01:03:14,205
Michael, I'll be in the office,
I have to do some sketches.

762
01:03:34,134 --> 01:03:36,124
Prepare this ASAP.

763
01:03:36,366 --> 01:03:38,076
Really? Is it something to light?

764
01:03:38,119 --> 01:03:41,339
No, I hope it's something the sheriff away.

765
01:04:57,932 --> 01:05:00,642
Hello Hello hello.

766
01:05:01,638 --> 01:05:04,508
Mary had a Little Lamb!

767
01:05:04,746 --> 01:05:06,806
Their skin...

768
01:05:33,994 --> 01:05:36,944
Hello Hello hello.

769
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:40,050
Mary had a Little Lamb!

770
01:05:40,329 --> 01:05:42,879
Her skin was white as snow.

771
01:05:43,159 --> 01:05:48,339
And where Mary went, the
lamb was also going.

772
01:06:19,858 --> 01:06:23,308
Hello Hello hello.

773
01:06:24,958 --> 01:06:27,378
Mary had a Little Lamb!

774
01:06:27,867 --> 01:06:30,207
Her skin was white as snow.

775
01:06:30,816 --> 01:06:35,916
And where Mary went, the
lamb was also going.

776
01:06:42,052 --> 01:06:47,982
- It's fantastic.
- It is a marvelous invention.

777
01:06:48,587 --> 01:06:53,597
It is not an invention.
It has always been there.

778
01:06:53,887 --> 01:06:57,497
- You mean what is an accident?
- No, no, nothing is accidental.

779
01:07:00,063 --> 01:07:04,883
Invention of the speaking machine,
read all about a talking machine!

780
01:07:05,363 --> 01:07:09,233
- Read all of a respect!
- What you should and you must.

781
01:07:09,467 --> 01:07:13,967
This is again about earlier, this
machine speaker is a gold mine.

782
01:07:16,281 --> 01:07:17,431
Mira, Dash.

783
01:07:18,433 --> 01:07:23,013
This is what I want to do. I want
your voice to the highest pitch.

784
01:07:23,653 --> 01:07:28,433
Here we go, before your mother comes,
he's a good kid and crying really hard.

785
01:07:28,469 --> 01:07:30,019
Not enough and screams?

786
01:07:30,307 --> 01:07:36,677
Dash go there, crying.
Look Dash, Dash, the bug.

787
01:07:37,001 --> 01:07:38,511
Dash, Dash.

788
01:07:39,432 --> 01:07:43,052
Look, look, Dash.

789
01:07:44,493 --> 01:07:50,663
Dash, please cry. Dash, look.

790
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:06,010
Well, I must say...

791
01:08:06,608 --> 01:08:10,468
I wanted to cry a little, but just laughs.

792
01:08:10,672 --> 01:08:16,762
It is not surprising,
seeing you to kid you both.

793
01:08:19,917 --> 01:08:24,847
- Some journalists want to see.
- About what? I'm busy.

794
01:08:25,097 --> 01:08:28,387
They want to know how far
you've come with electricity.

795
01:08:28,683 --> 01:08:30,833
I would like to know why.
But, talk to them.

796
01:08:31,074 --> 01:08:33,904
Tell them to grant an interview when
you have something more concrete.

797
01:08:34,381 --> 01:08:36,891
I understand. You are in
darkness over the light.

798
01:08:38,406 --> 01:08:39,796
You better hide.

799
01:08:44,542 --> 01:08:49,922
- No, no, one at a time.
- Tell us about the bulb.

800
01:08:49,956 --> 01:08:51,746
We heard that he was working on the bulb.

801
01:08:51,789 --> 01:08:53,389
Mr. Edison can not see anyone now.

802
01:08:53,826 --> 01:08:57,486
- If there's anything I can do?
- Who are you?

803
01:08:57,731 --> 01:09:01,761
I was his partner and
friend for many years.

804
01:09:02,114 --> 01:09:04,184
Maybe you Edison invented, right?

805
01:09:05,262 --> 01:09:07,532
That boy does not have grace.

806
01:09:07,773 --> 01:09:13,593
We worked together as
telegraph, I can say clear

807
01:09:14,069 --> 01:09:17,049
that everything he knows about
what I taught telegraphy.

808
01:09:17,336 --> 01:09:19,766
I was always a good instructor.

809
01:09:19,807 --> 01:09:23,067
I worked in the Western
Telegraph Station, just

810
01:09:23,353 --> 01:09:26,813
I had to catch a rattlesnake as a pet.

811
01:09:27,059 --> 01:09:28,879
I called Pete.

812
01:09:29,091 --> 01:09:36,541
During the long winter
evenings I taught Pete Morse.

813
01:09:38,415 --> 01:09:40,715
Then the snake escaped.

814
01:09:41,045 --> 01:09:44,035
One day I was hunting alone.

815
01:09:44,073 --> 01:09:47,183
I found a snake in the bush.
I pointed my shotgun.

816
01:09:47,216 --> 01:09:49,206
And when he went to shoot,
can you believe it?

817
01:09:50,568 --> 01:09:55,068
I hear the bells says "Stop,
But, do not shoot, I'm Pete."

818
01:09:55,988 --> 01:09:59,678
- Just a minute, Mr...
- Cabbott.

819
01:10:00,132 --> 01:10:04,392
- James J. Cabbot, But known.
- Charmed.

820
01:10:04,634 --> 01:10:06,234
Mr. Cabbot, we did not come

821
01:10:06,268 --> 01:10:09,618
to hear their stories of snakes
but to interview Mr. Edison.

822
01:10:09,650 --> 01:10:11,410
Mr. Edison is locked in his laboratory.

823
01:10:12,126 --> 01:10:16,386
- On the verge of a discovery.
- What is it about?

824
01:10:16,668 --> 01:10:19,728
- Gentlemen, I can not speak.
- Is it about the light bulb?

825
01:10:20,215 --> 01:10:24,395
- That should ask him.
- Why does not tell us?

826
01:10:24,877 --> 01:10:27,307
First I think it does not have
the bulb and will not think.

827
01:10:27,342 --> 01:10:29,942
- Yea, no, huh?
- No, I do not think so and more

828
01:10:29,977 --> 01:10:32,527
I think of no value to confess.
Castles behind him.

829
01:10:33,165 --> 01:10:36,985
Listen to me, he's in there because
it already has that light.

830
01:10:37,025 --> 01:10:39,015
- You mean he has discovered?
- Yes.

831
01:10:39,057 --> 01:10:40,268
- Do you already have the light bulb?
- Yes.

832
01:10:40,292 --> 01:10:41,182
Why not advertised?

833
01:10:41,214 --> 01:10:43,576
One thing at a time. Just finished
with the talking machine.

834
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:45,950
It's not a matter of piling
all these great inventions.

835
01:10:46,274 --> 01:10:50,544
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

836
01:10:51,694 --> 01:10:53,284
Stubborn.

837
01:10:53,606 --> 01:10:55,786
I think I have dispatched to taste.

838
01:10:57,511 --> 01:10:58,511
I think so.

839
01:11:00,022 --> 01:11:02,402
Edison says the electric lamp is a success.

840
01:11:02,811 --> 01:11:05,921
The genius of Menlo Park
declares that being refined.

841
01:11:09,665 --> 01:11:11,885
I'm usually a quiet guy.

842
01:11:12,613 --> 01:11:13,773
But I got so mad...

843
01:11:13,809 --> 01:11:15,849
I did not know that light.
I am far from having it.

844
01:11:16,757 --> 01:11:19,997
- I did not imagine they would believe me.
- Who reads the newspapers believe it.

845
01:11:20,025 --> 01:11:22,725
Less scientists, who will skin me alive.

846
01:11:24,249 --> 01:11:27,939
Well, I esfumaré a season.

847
01:11:33,095 --> 01:11:34,915
If I had money, he disappeared.

848
01:11:35,605 --> 01:11:37,665
Can you lend me $ 20?

849
01:11:45,487 --> 01:11:47,667
Here are the 10 that I owe you.

850
01:11:48,236 --> 01:11:50,186
Like clear the accounts?

851
01:11:50,986 --> 01:11:52,926
Well, take care.

852
01:11:53,217 --> 01:11:54,407
Of course.

853
01:11:55,010 --> 01:11:59,350
I'm sorry I screwed well.
Tell them it's my fault.

854
01:11:59,752 --> 01:12:02,622
No, do not worry, But.

855
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:05,010
I am glad that it is over.

856
01:12:05,371 --> 01:12:07,641
Now I have to get to the bulb.

857
01:12:12,902 --> 01:12:15,492
Gas shares have fallen another whole.

858
01:12:15,731 --> 01:12:19,041
Knights please calm. There is no bulb.

859
01:12:19,073 --> 01:12:20,793
- How do you know?
- It is my duty to know.

860
01:12:20,951 --> 01:12:24,771
No light bulb and will not. It is
impossible as perpetual motion.

861
01:12:24,975 --> 01:12:28,475
- Then you have to unmask.
- I will not move a finger.

862
01:12:28,517 --> 01:12:30,131
It is not necessary. It has put the noose.

863
01:12:30,155 --> 01:12:32,275
He said something that is
not true and never will be.

864
01:12:32,546 --> 01:12:35,096
In the field of science that
is equivalent to suicide.

865
01:12:35,131 --> 01:12:37,051
It is true. It has sought their undoing.

866
01:12:37,687 --> 01:12:42,577
The light bulb is a fake
ad, it's fairy tale.

867
01:12:42,867 --> 01:12:47,077
He knows or should know that it is
impossible as perpetual motion.

868
01:12:47,330 --> 01:12:51,510
All these claims on an electric light.

869
01:12:51,832 --> 01:12:55,892
They lack any scientific
foundation, ladies and gentlemen.

870
01:12:56,136 --> 01:12:59,876
Mr. Edison refuses to
show his mysterious bulb.

871
01:13:00,439 --> 01:13:05,779
We can assume for his refusal
that there is this bulb.

872
01:13:13,748 --> 01:13:15,888
It has burned all the gas.

873
01:13:16,258 --> 01:13:18,318
Well, it will not function.

874
01:13:18,490 --> 01:13:20,520
- We have to try something else.
- What?

875
01:13:20,881 --> 01:13:25,941
We've tried dozens of metals, lead,
copper, iron, aluminum, tin.

876
01:13:25,976 --> 01:13:28,756
We have to test hundreds
more, perhaps thousands.

877
01:13:29,488 --> 01:13:31,328
But I know that somewhere in this universe.

878
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:33,660
There is a substance that
will work and we will find.

879
01:14:18,101 --> 01:14:22,201
We need more light for its
size or not progress at all.

880
01:14:22,643 --> 01:14:25,103
If platinum does not give us, I
do not know what we can give.

881
01:14:25,791 --> 01:14:27,661
- We connect?
- Yes.

882
01:14:39,140 --> 01:14:41,490
Well, it should work, but not working.

883
01:14:43,404 --> 01:14:45,994
There must be some reason
which we have not thought of.

884
01:14:47,628 --> 01:14:50,208
We may not have the right stuff.

885
01:14:56,274 --> 01:14:58,224
We've tried everything but that.

886
01:15:04,443 --> 01:15:06,713
Come on, son, crying. Cries.

887
01:15:12,293 --> 01:15:14,753
Cry, cry, child. Cries.

888
01:15:18,270 --> 01:15:19,990
- Do you ever cry?
- Very often.

889
01:15:20,023 --> 01:15:23,803
Never when I'm here, I try
since I was 9 months.

890
01:15:25,084 --> 01:15:29,984
Come son, crying, please. Cry, cry baby.

891
01:15:31,698 --> 01:15:34,448
- Tom, that's terrible.
- What it is terrible?

892
01:15:34,488 --> 01:15:37,948
Listen to that, "When asked his
opinion about Mr. Edison, Professor."

893
01:15:37,989 --> 01:15:41,489
He said that in the world of science
there is no place for a charlatan."

894
01:15:42,178 --> 01:15:45,318
- Tom.
- You see, did you hear that?

895
01:15:45,605 --> 01:15:49,655
Everyone says that your father
is an impostor. Do not listen.

896
01:15:51,662 --> 01:15:55,612
He does not care. Discredited
and he sat there quietly.

897
01:15:56,523 --> 01:15:59,093
Léeselo back slowly to understand.

898
01:15:59,122 --> 01:16:01,652
I hope I never see that again But Cabbot.

899
01:16:01,902 --> 01:16:04,532
No, do not be hard on him. We've
had some good times together.

900
01:16:04,731 --> 01:16:07,111
I would shake his head until
his brain unraveling.

901
01:16:07,401 --> 01:16:09,001
Come on, son crying, please.

902
01:16:09,035 --> 01:16:11,375
Although I do not think I have brain.

903
01:16:11,625 --> 01:16:13,965
No, only a vacuum.

904
01:16:14,773 --> 01:16:16,883
Well, even the vacuum can
sometimes be useful.

905
01:16:16,918 --> 01:16:18,988
I remember when I was an
old dog perdiguera...

906
01:16:19,674 --> 01:16:20,864
Empty...

907
01:16:21,188 --> 01:16:22,738
Empty.

908
01:16:24,097 --> 01:16:25,287
I already have it.

909
01:16:26,767 --> 01:16:28,117
Tom, what ...?

910
01:16:31,230 --> 01:16:35,600
Simon, we need an empty, that's
what we were looking for.

911
01:16:35,932 --> 01:16:39,992
It burns because the cable
is in contact with air.

912
01:16:40,155 --> 01:16:44,735
Much oxygen. We will place the cable
in a glass globe and we get the air.

913
01:16:44,773 --> 01:16:46,413
We will put current and see what happens.

914
01:16:47,168 --> 01:16:48,988
No, tonight.

915
01:17:01,593 --> 01:17:03,973
- Is it worth it?
- It is sufficient for now.

916
01:17:05,418 --> 01:17:07,078
- Thank you.
- Connect the power.

917
01:17:10,678 --> 01:17:12,978
Now it gives more shine.

918
01:17:13,228 --> 01:17:16,408
Not enough, we need to improve the vacuum.

919
01:17:16,775 --> 01:17:20,355
But Tom, we've already reduced to one
hundred thousandth of atmosphere.

920
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:23,820
- It has to be better than that.
- We can not with that bomb.

921
01:17:25,382 --> 01:17:27,342
There is a pump mercury
in Princeton could serve.

922
01:17:27,369 --> 01:17:28,999
Maybe they give us.

923
01:17:36,937 --> 01:17:38,887
Do we have enough empty, Mike?

924
01:17:39,647 --> 01:17:41,987
More will be impossible.

925
01:17:42,635 --> 01:17:44,535
Okay, connect the current.

926
01:17:46,779 --> 01:17:48,809
Let's go there.

927
01:18:05,786 --> 01:18:07,736
Well, we have failed again.

928
01:18:08,695 --> 01:18:11,825
This is the conclusion
of 9,000 experiments.

929
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:14,670
Terrible Tom.

930
01:18:14,872 --> 01:18:19,692
We know you've worked. Sorry
much as you do not get results.

931
01:18:19,892 --> 01:18:23,952
Results? I have many results,
9,000 things not working.

932
01:18:28,260 --> 01:18:29,260
It's a shame.

933
01:18:43,482 --> 01:18:45,552
I would like to see Mr. Edison, please.

934
01:18:45,589 --> 01:18:46,589
What for?

935
01:18:46,709 --> 01:18:48,979
I would like to study to be an inventor.

936
01:18:52,407 --> 01:18:53,517
Oh yeah?

937
01:18:53,762 --> 01:18:54,912
Why?

938
01:18:55,675 --> 01:19:00,365
Because the inventors create things
and I like to create things.

939
01:19:00,935 --> 01:19:02,675
What.

940
01:19:04,322 --> 01:19:05,552
See this?

941
01:19:06,752 --> 01:19:10,052
- Do you see how well it works?
- Show me again.

942
01:19:12,729 --> 01:19:13,949
Very good.

943
01:19:14,164 --> 01:19:17,074
I made myself, I always broke the nail.

944
01:19:18,428 --> 01:19:20,218
Can you make me one?

945
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:22,050
I do not know.

946
01:19:22,213 --> 01:19:23,403
Perhaps.

947
01:19:24,006 --> 01:19:27,666
- Not worth much as a knife, right?
- It'll be when the fix.

948
01:19:27,911 --> 01:19:30,621
- Tom, where were you?
- Mr Els,

949
01:19:30,820 --> 01:19:33,450
this young man would like to be
an inventor. What is your name?

950
01:19:33,485 --> 01:19:34,235
Jimmy Price.

951
01:19:34,287 --> 01:19:36,687
Well, Jimmy, this is Mr. Els,
Jimmy will be working with us.

952
01:19:36,837 --> 01:19:39,177
Where do you live? Where do you sleep?

953
01:19:39,387 --> 01:19:43,887
Well, for now I'll have to sleep here.

954
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:49,940
Take him to the guesthouse.
Give him food and bed.

955
01:19:54,051 --> 01:19:55,201
What happens to you?

956
01:19:55,605 --> 01:19:57,185
God...

957
01:19:57,597 --> 01:19:58,917
Are you Thomas Edison's?

958
01:19:58,952 --> 01:20:02,172
I think so, Jimmy, but
sometimes I am not clear.

959
01:20:03,295 --> 01:20:05,995
You start work at eight o'clock

960
01:20:08,834 --> 01:20:11,744
Edison failed experiment with light.
The inventor is wrong.

961
01:20:11,902 --> 01:20:15,402
It is known that research to
create light with electric current.

962
01:20:15,648 --> 01:20:16,868
It has proved fruitless.

963
01:20:24,613 --> 01:20:25,613
Good morning, Tom.

964
01:20:25,849 --> 01:20:28,269
Good morning, boys, to work.

965
01:20:32,304 --> 01:20:34,684
Why light?

966
01:20:35,890 --> 01:20:38,470
Let's use carbon filament
instead of a metal.

967
01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:41,859
- Filament? I do not know the word.
- Neither I just invented.

968
01:20:42,624 --> 01:20:46,494
It is a sewing thread. Put
it in the oven for one hour.

969
01:20:46,728 --> 01:20:49,678
But before imprégnala carbon.

970
01:20:49,956 --> 01:20:51,746
Then we will prove in the bulb.

971
01:20:51,789 --> 01:20:53,899
But the thread is very delicate.
It will break.

972
01:20:54,180 --> 01:20:55,340
Anyway we will try.

973
01:20:55,375 --> 01:20:57,825
- We have already proven carbon.
- No carbonized thread.

974
01:20:58,045 --> 01:20:59,296
That's not very scientific, Tom.

975
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:01,510
I said we have to put aside science.
Come on, do it.

976
01:21:52,157 --> 01:21:53,947
Be careful, do not go
to break the filament.

977
01:21:54,110 --> 01:21:55,660
It is the 65th.

978
01:21:56,381 --> 01:21:59,027
- Has broken? Is everything alright?
- Yes, everything will go well.

979
01:21:59,051 --> 01:22:00,761
Look, he's holding.

980
01:22:14,989 --> 01:22:17,889
Jimmy, bring it to Mr.
Edison, but carefully.

981
01:22:19,811 --> 01:22:21,131
I'll be right.

982
01:22:35,511 --> 01:22:37,871
For the love of God, Jimmy, do
not you know how to keep up?

983
01:22:42,962 --> 01:22:44,752
Here's a full day's work.

984
01:23:00,734 --> 01:23:01,804
Jimmy.

985
01:23:02,726 --> 01:23:03,726
¡Jimmy!

986
01:23:03,961 --> 01:23:05,281
Yes.

987
01:23:20,099 --> 01:23:21,809
Watch out for this one, remains hot.

988
01:23:24,363 --> 01:23:26,633
Take it, let Jimmy, we're losing time.

989
01:23:32,452 --> 01:23:33,452
Come on.

990
01:24:12,618 --> 01:24:15,328
The good thing is that
errors are not forever.

991
01:24:15,805 --> 01:24:17,785
I should have learned it as a boy.

992
01:24:22,141 --> 01:24:24,171
A filament

993
01:24:24,851 --> 01:24:28,151
cotton yarn horseshoe-shaped,

994
01:24:29,114 --> 01:24:32,184
impregnated carbon.

995
01:24:32,780 --> 01:24:36,480
And enclosed vacuum.

996
01:24:40,829 --> 01:24:42,859
Well, we will test duration.

997
01:24:44,734 --> 01:24:46,724
I'm almost afraid to connect.

998
01:24:48,998 --> 01:24:50,188
Let's go there!

999
01:25:34,543 --> 01:25:36,813
It seems that this will last.

1000
01:25:47,493 --> 01:25:49,003
Continues on.

1001
01:25:49,844 --> 01:25:53,224
- Well, it should be 7:00.
- Yes, maybe more.

1002
01:25:53,271 --> 01:25:54,301
How about coffee?

1003
01:25:54,626 --> 01:25:56,726
No, I want a glass of milk.

1004
01:25:56,977 --> 01:25:59,157
- And bring him another Jimmy.
- Clear.

1005
01:25:59,447 --> 01:26:01,317
And a piece of cake.

1006
01:26:01,679 --> 01:26:04,139
Go home and get some sleep.

1007
01:26:05,345 --> 01:26:08,125
He's been here all day.

1008
01:26:12,836 --> 01:26:15,136
I will not fall out of bed, Mom.

1009
01:27:17,667 --> 01:27:18,887
Above.

1010
01:27:20,058 --> 01:27:24,598
Do you like my shoes? Am I
pretty with my pink dress?

1011
01:27:24,635 --> 01:27:25,635
If these.

1012
01:28:41,505 --> 01:28:43,295
More current.

1013
01:28:50,311 --> 01:28:51,941
The maximum.

1014
01:29:00,472 --> 01:29:02,022
Open the gas.

1015
01:29:05,373 --> 01:29:07,723
- 40 hours.
- Well, well.

1016
01:29:08,641 --> 01:29:11,461
If you have endured 40
hours, it will hold 400.

1017
01:29:20,794 --> 01:29:22,784
Put this filament under a microscope.

1018
01:29:23,105 --> 01:29:25,655
- What day is today?
- October 21.

1019
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:42,260
It is calling newspapers.

1020
01:29:48,169 --> 01:29:50,089
He says he will illuminate
the city of New York.

1021
01:29:50,281 --> 01:29:52,911
Well, I'm going to bed.

1022
01:29:56,338 --> 01:29:58,208
Edison invented the incandescent lamp.

1023
01:30:00,721 --> 01:30:03,621
Edison requested a concession to
illuminate the city of New York.

1024
01:30:04,267 --> 01:30:06,687
Edison asked the council
to inspect the new system

1025
01:30:07,056 --> 01:30:08,876
eléctrico de Menlo Park.

1026
01:30:10,005 --> 01:30:13,105
Calm down, Jim, concerns
cause me indigestion.

1027
01:30:13,591 --> 01:30:16,221
If Edison gets permission
to light the city.

1028
01:30:16,250 --> 01:30:18,840
I can go and making a
bonfire of my actions gas.

1029
01:30:19,090 --> 01:30:22,000
Let him do it. The bulb
probably not going to work.

1030
01:30:22,034 --> 01:30:23,394
This is the problem, it will work.

1031
01:30:23,593 --> 01:30:27,653
It invents everything works and works well.
I know perfectly.

1032
01:30:28,096 --> 01:30:29,376
What do you want me to do?

1033
01:30:29,411 --> 01:30:31,521
Prevents you get the concession.

1034
01:30:31,722 --> 01:30:36,782
I see no reason why Mr. Edison
did not have a concession

1035
01:30:36,817 --> 01:30:39,967
seeking to electrically
illuminate a district...

1036
01:30:40,209 --> 01:30:43,819
Mr. President, your enthusiasm is
not shared by us, not even close.

1037
01:30:44,274 --> 01:30:48,624
We are asked to allow that New
York is used as a testing ground.

1038
01:30:48,652 --> 01:30:50,952
The electricity has already
been tested thoroughly.

1039
01:30:50,980 --> 01:30:53,240
The risk of fire is much
lower than the gas.

1040
01:30:53,274 --> 01:30:53,834
Wait a moment.

1041
01:30:54,195 --> 01:30:55,855
The gas is not at issue.

1042
01:30:55,909 --> 01:30:58,489
No, but apparently, the
light bulb itself is.

1043
01:30:59,216 --> 01:31:02,476
I said to them that we are
willing to bury cables

1044
01:31:02,518 --> 01:31:04,158
to avoid overloading the telephone poles.

1045
01:31:04,994 --> 01:31:08,074
I guarantee you that we will
take all necessary precautions.

1046
01:31:08,102 --> 01:31:10,708
I still say the risk is too great
for those impossible advantages.

1047
01:31:10,732 --> 01:31:12,562
But they are not impossible.

1048
01:31:12,764 --> 01:31:15,594
Even if it were, my partners
and I run the risk.

1049
01:31:15,628 --> 01:31:18,138
We do not ask financial
assistance to taxpayers.

1050
01:31:18,821 --> 01:31:21,811
We are only asking for permission
to install our equipment, our

1051
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:24,790
own risk, own coasts, and if
we fail, we will lose only.

1052
01:31:25,117 --> 01:31:29,617
- It seems fair. Can we vote?
- Mr. Edison!

1053
01:31:29,898 --> 01:31:34,178
One more thing if I may. He knows
that no existing dynamo is capable

1054
01:31:34,216 --> 01:31:38,456
to produce enough current
to power your light system.

1055
01:31:38,744 --> 01:31:43,044
- If that is true.
- How will you do this miracle?

1056
01:31:43,486 --> 01:31:46,706
I build a dynamo. Big enough

1057
01:31:46,749 --> 01:31:47,429
to do the job.

1058
01:31:47,670 --> 01:31:50,540
Let me speak, please, I
insist on being heard.

1059
01:31:50,574 --> 01:31:51,294
Sr. Taggart,

1060
01:31:51,575 --> 01:31:53,275
this is an intolerable insolence.

1061
01:31:53,318 --> 01:31:54,988
Let him talk, it is a taxpayer.

1062
01:31:56,277 --> 01:31:58,737
- Be brief, Mr. Taggart.
- Thank you.

1063
01:32:02,573 --> 01:32:05,523
I draw attention to this
advice about the law requiring

1064
01:32:05,552 --> 01:32:08,462
a limit for all contracts execution time.

1065
01:32:09,108 --> 01:32:12,808
Mr. Edison's project must be
completed on a given day.

1066
01:32:12,848 --> 01:32:14,078
This is the law.

1067
01:32:14,168 --> 01:32:18,268
Mr. Edison, how long will your experiment?

1068
01:32:18,591 --> 01:32:21,781
- It will not be an experiment.
- Let's stop quibbling.

1069
01:32:21,814 --> 01:32:22,574
How long will that take?

1070
01:32:22,815 --> 01:32:24,365
It will take a year, maybe two.

1071
01:32:24,409 --> 01:32:26,759
There it is, gentlemen, a year, maybe two.

1072
01:32:27,079 --> 01:32:28,909
That means that for two years the streets.

1073
01:32:28,947 --> 01:32:30,657
City of New York will be a chaos.

1074
01:32:30,864 --> 01:32:35,484
The traffic paralyzed.
As a taxpayer I protest.

1075
01:32:35,765 --> 01:32:38,075
Protest with all our strength.

1076
01:32:38,111 --> 01:32:39,471
What do you suggest then?

1077
01:32:41,424 --> 01:32:45,164
I suggest that he be granted
a period of three months.

1078
01:32:45,368 --> 01:32:47,638
Can you do it in three months, Mr. Edison?

1079
01:32:48,038 --> 01:32:49,828
No sir.

1080
01:32:50,270 --> 01:32:53,730
And I doubt that Mr. Taggart gas
pipelines installing it at the time.

1081
01:32:53,936 --> 01:32:57,476
The gas is there, Mr.
Edison, working for profit

1082
01:32:57,517 --> 01:32:59,187
of thousands of grateful taxpayers.

1083
01:32:59,514 --> 01:33:04,024
Those taxpayers have rights
that must protect this advice.

1084
01:33:04,052 --> 01:33:05,052
Sr. Presidente.

1085
01:33:05,133 --> 01:33:07,403
Sr. Edison.

1086
01:33:07,723 --> 01:33:11,223
I have not come to deprive
taxpayers of any rights.

1087
01:33:11,707 --> 01:33:14,377
I invite the Council to enable
them to make use of a discovery

1088
01:33:14,412 --> 01:33:16,252
that is not hazardous or impair anyone

1089
01:33:16,688 --> 01:33:20,028
except those who fear competition
from their monopolies.

1090
01:33:20,195 --> 01:33:22,935
Its specialists have found
that electricity is practical.

1091
01:33:23,382 --> 01:33:27,002
His detractors know that
will be cheaper than gas.

1092
01:33:27,208 --> 01:33:29,268
And this is the reason for attack.

1093
01:33:29,758 --> 01:33:31,978
But this is not why I'm struggling here.

1094
01:33:32,826 --> 01:33:34,736
I have not sought for years

1095
01:33:34,779 --> 01:33:36,809
because there was money
at the end of the search.

1096
01:33:39,122 --> 01:33:42,822
But because I have always known
that if he found a light flameless

1097
01:33:43,226 --> 01:33:45,536
and I could install in homes where men

1098
01:33:45,577 --> 01:33:49,477
and women view under oil
lamps and gas left,

1099
01:33:49,841 --> 01:33:54,221
where surgeons operate, where
scientists work with microscopes,

1100
01:33:54,423 --> 01:33:57,373
even in the coal mines, people everywhere.

1101
01:33:57,531 --> 01:34:00,351
They could have a clearer or safe light.

1102
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:05,410
Then I would be doing something for their
welfare, both making money or not.

1103
01:34:06,258 --> 01:34:08,838
Well, that light has
already been discovered.

1104
01:34:10,123 --> 01:34:11,993
What are you going to do about it?

1105
01:34:12,992 --> 01:34:15,972
You could install gas pipelines
in six months, Mr. Taggart?

1106
01:34:17,495 --> 01:34:18,555
Easily.

1107
01:34:22,356 --> 01:34:24,906
Okay, then, say six months.
What do you think?

1108
01:34:25,145 --> 01:34:27,335
- Can we vote, gentlemen?
- Yes.

1109
01:34:27,377 --> 01:34:29,757
Those in favor of giving the concession.

1110
01:34:29,967 --> 01:34:32,117
- Yeah.
- Against?

1111
01:34:32,158 --> 01:34:34,978
- No.
- The concession is granted.

1112
01:34:35,187 --> 01:34:38,287
I congratulate you, Mr.
Edison. - 6 months!

1113
01:34:39,052 --> 01:34:43,192
That amounts to 4 September.

1114
01:34:43,634 --> 01:34:44,824
Thank you very much sir.

1115
01:35:30,853 --> 01:35:32,203
- Tom.
- Oh thanks.

1116
01:35:36,591 --> 01:35:39,221
- How do we, boys?
- It is the world's largest.

1117
01:35:39,818 --> 01:35:42,768
- The call Jumbo.
- I baptize Jumbo.

1118
01:35:44,321 --> 01:35:45,911
Just it is kidding, Tom.

1119
01:35:47,230 --> 01:35:49,730
New York is looking forward
to testing electricity.

1120
01:35:50,099 --> 01:35:52,599
Edison struggle to meet the deadline.

1121
01:35:53,127 --> 01:35:55,707
It's two o'clock. We have five hours.

1122
01:35:56,435 --> 01:35:58,295
We will load test.

1123
01:35:58,586 --> 01:36:00,966
Preparations for the maximum load test.

1124
01:36:05,121 --> 01:36:06,711
Number 1.

1125
01:36:13,529 --> 01:36:15,349
Okay, number 2.

1126
01:36:24,686 --> 01:36:26,506
Another parallel.

1127
01:37:02,581 --> 01:37:04,171
More speed.

1128
01:37:09,753 --> 01:37:11,263
Faster, faster.

1129
01:37:11,706 --> 01:37:13,686
More speed.

1130
01:37:14,774 --> 01:37:18,204
More, now, more, more.

1131
01:37:19,276 --> 01:37:22,296
Stop, stop!

1132
01:37:37,885 --> 01:37:38,885
No va a funcionar.

1133
01:37:40,515 --> 01:37:42,175
You have any problem.

1134
01:37:42,906 --> 01:37:45,656
The engine did not revolve at
the same speed, a dynamo pushed

1135
01:37:45,690 --> 01:37:46,860
other.

1136
01:37:46,890 --> 01:37:49,190
The fault is in the regulators.

1137
01:37:50,756 --> 01:37:53,626
We need to connect these
pads together with a shaft.

1138
01:37:53,659 --> 01:37:55,929
We can not do, Tom, is too much work.

1139
01:37:57,131 --> 01:38:00,471
Send someone to fetch 5m.
Steel shaft of an inch.

1140
01:38:00,797 --> 01:38:03,267
Five hours is enough, Tom. We have no time.

1141
01:38:03,302 --> 01:38:05,172
You miss not talking. Do it.

1142
01:38:06,415 --> 01:38:08,565
Come on guys. Ensure damage.

1143
01:38:08,602 --> 01:38:09,602
Let's do it.

1144
01:38:12,711 --> 01:38:14,741
Why not play more upbeat music?

1145
01:38:15,301 --> 01:38:17,771
- Mr. Taggart.
- Not now. Go.

1146
01:38:17,807 --> 01:38:18,847
Mr. Taggart, let him hear.

1147
01:38:24,865 --> 01:38:28,075
- Very interesting, very interesting.
- I figured you would like to know.

1148
01:38:28,371 --> 01:38:32,401
Thank you. Knights just
received great news.

1149
01:38:32,431 --> 01:38:32,941
What is it about?

1150
01:38:33,033 --> 01:38:37,023
Our friend Edison has problems.
A last minute miscalculation.

1151
01:38:37,053 --> 01:38:38,133
Your dynamos were damaged.

1152
01:38:45,107 --> 01:38:47,607
What a beautiful music.

1153
01:38:52,399 --> 01:38:53,709
Okay, I conectadlo.

1154
01:38:55,706 --> 01:38:57,656
Give her back.

1155
01:39:00,408 --> 01:39:01,678
Do you catch right?

1156
01:39:02,440 --> 01:39:04,470
19 to 4.

1157
01:39:04,791 --> 01:39:07,251
Very good. Put the belt.

1158
01:39:07,461 --> 01:39:11,681
- Tom, what happened?
- Jumbo trouble breaking.

1159
01:39:12,004 --> 01:39:15,464
Look how pants. Your new blue suit.

1160
01:39:16,546 --> 01:39:18,566
How did he been?

1161
01:39:22,683 --> 01:39:25,143
I'll never get fixed.

1162
01:39:28,580 --> 01:39:30,010
What dear?

1163
01:39:30,253 --> 01:39:32,053
- I'm worried.
- Why the dynamos?

1164
01:39:32,081 --> 01:39:33,411
Suppose fallen.

1165
01:39:33,441 --> 01:39:35,471
- They will not fail.
- You should have been.

1166
01:39:35,792 --> 01:39:37,622
I wish I had your confidence.

1167
01:39:38,422 --> 01:39:40,562
I wish I had yours.

1168
01:39:41,092 --> 01:39:44,082
- Tom, for 1 minute.
- Well, we are in time.

1169
01:39:44,115 --> 01:39:47,065
Remind me a kiss and a hug afterwards.

1170
01:39:47,104 --> 01:39:48,704
No estorbes.

1171
01:39:48,982 --> 01:39:50,462
- Ready, boys?
- Yes, ready.

1172
01:39:50,491 --> 01:39:52,511
Later, Mick.

1173
01:39:52,540 --> 01:39:54,490
Let's see, number 1.

1174
01:39:54,520 --> 01:39:56,660
Calm, slowly now.

1175
01:40:04,243 --> 01:40:05,753
Number 2.

1176
01:40:20,540 --> 01:40:22,600
Well, Molex connectors in parallel.

1177
01:40:25,521 --> 01:40:26,791
Forward.

1178
01:40:34,447 --> 01:40:35,997
Watch feeders.

WEALTH

1197
01:42:06,733 --> 01:42:10,083
And yet, it would have been a great man

1198
01:42:10,319 --> 01:42:13,139
although it had not invented anything.

1199
01:42:13,387 --> 01:42:18,327
Caballeras and gentlemen,
here's to a man who will remain

1200
01:42:18,363 --> 01:42:19,393
eternally full of life

1201
01:42:19,842 --> 01:42:22,272
and vibrant inspiration.

1202
01:42:22,791 --> 01:42:25,501
Thomas Alva Edison.

1203
01:42:39,487 --> 01:42:41,597
Mr. host...

1204
01:42:47,934 --> 01:42:49,684
Mr. Toastmaster.

1205
01:42:50,126 --> 01:42:52,066
Ladies and Gentlemen,

1206
01:42:52,955 --> 01:42:56,455
To be told by the outstanding
men and women of our time

1207
01:42:57,458 --> 01:43:02,518
that you have contributed a
great deal to human betterman.

1208
01:43:02,553 --> 01:43:03,953
Very pleasant. Very pleasant.

1209
01:43:04,790 --> 01:43:10,160
I'd hardly be humeed if my heart did not
feel from such magnificent compliment.

1210
01:43:12,360 --> 01:43:16,740
But somehow I have not
achieved the success I want.

1211
01:43:18,298 --> 01:43:23,268
Early this evening, I talked
with two school children.

1212
01:43:24,514 --> 01:43:28,214
Tomorrow, the world will be theirs.

1213
01:43:28,419 --> 01:43:32,709
A troubled world, full of
doubt and uncertainties.

1214
01:43:33,798 --> 01:43:37,138
You say that the we men of
science have been helping it.

1215
01:43:38,181 --> 01:43:44,871
Are those children and their children
going to approve of what we have done?

1216
01:43:46,629 --> 01:43:52,839
Or you discover too late that they
have relied too heavily on science

1217
01:43:53,921 --> 01:43:56,951
and that this has become a monster

1218
01:43:57,587 --> 01:44:02,247
whose final triumph is man own destruction.

1219
01:44:04,640 --> 01:44:08,700
Some of us have already
beginning to feel that danger.

1220
01:44:09,700 --> 01:44:12,570
But it can be avoided.

1221
01:44:13,366 --> 01:44:16,186
I had once two dynamos.

1222
01:44:17,112 --> 01:44:19,332
They needed regulating.

1223
01:44:19,901 --> 01:44:23,961
It was a problem of balance and adjustment.

1224
01:44:25,639 --> 01:44:29,539
And I feel that the confusion
in the world today,

1225
01:44:29,943 --> 01:44:33,053
presents much the same problem.

1226
01:44:34,326 --> 01:44:39,426
But dynamo of man's God given ingenuity

1227
01:44:40,143 --> 01:44:46,963
is running away with the dowel of
his equally God given humanity.

1228
01:44:49,627 --> 01:44:54,957
I'm too old now to do
much more than to say.

1229
01:44:55,285 --> 01:44:58,815
Put those dynamos in balance.

1230
01:44:59,868 --> 01:45:03,288
Make them work in harmony

1231
01:45:03,653 --> 01:45:07,713
as the great designer intended they should.

1232
01:45:09,032 --> 01:45:14,802
It can be done. What man's mind can see

1233
01:45:15,488 --> 01:45:18,828
man's character can control.

1234
01:45:21,106 --> 01:45:23,966
Man must learn that.

1235
01:45:24,214 --> 01:45:28,434
And then we won't need to
be afraid of tomorrow.

1236
01:45:29,155 --> 01:45:32,895
And man will go forward,

1237
01:45:33,220 --> 01:45:37,720
toward more light.
