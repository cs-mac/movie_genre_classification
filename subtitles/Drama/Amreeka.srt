1
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,250
Sorry.

2
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:15,924
See you tomorrow.

3
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:07,904
She never told me.

4
00:10:01,952 --> 00:10:02,935
Ihab Abdulla.

5
00:16:36,391 --> 00:16:37,974
- I love you.
- I love you.

6
00:17:35,033 --> 00:17:36,046
Citizenship?

7
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:38,335
We don't have.

8
00:17:39,137 --> 00:17:40,297
You don't have citizenship?

9
00:17:41,442 --> 00:17:42,912
As in, you don't
have a country.

10
00:17:43,453 --> 00:17:44,562
That's right.

11
00:17:45,425 --> 00:17:46,645
Where are you from?

12
00:17:47,472 --> 00:17:49,241
- Israel?
- No, no.

13
00:17:49,473 --> 00:17:51,555
It's the Palestinian territory.

14
00:17:58,450 --> 00:17:59,318
Your occupation?

15
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:00,750
Yes.

16
00:18:00,751 --> 00:18:03,244
It is occupied
for forty years.

17
00:18:03,946 --> 00:18:06,717
No. What is your occupation?

18
00:18:08,674 --> 00:18:10,376
What--What do you do
for a living, ma'am?

19
00:18:10,742 --> 00:18:13,397
Oh yes, I was working
in banking.

20
00:18:16,198 --> 00:18:17,153
Is this your son?

21
00:18:17,794 --> 00:18:19,173
Yes. Fadi.

22
00:18:21,172 --> 00:18:22,616
Your husband
travelling with you?

23
00:18:22,617 --> 00:18:24,803
No. We have divorced.

24
00:18:25,055 --> 00:18:27,203
My husband--
He's not a good man.

25
00:18:46,487 --> 00:18:46,917
Ma'am?

26
00:18:55,141 --> 00:18:55,715
Ma'am?

27
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:57,570
Yes?

28
00:18:58,222 --> 00:19:00,246
Has anyone asked you to bring
anything into the country?

29
00:19:00,498 --> 00:19:02,033
Only my mother.

30
00:19:02,415 --> 00:19:04,459
Are you carrying
any firearms?

31
00:19:04,851 --> 00:19:05,885
Repeat please.

32
00:19:06,156 --> 00:19:08,775
Are you carrying
any firearms?

33
00:19:08,977 --> 00:19:11,459
- Guns, weapons.
- No, no. No.

34
00:19:12,994 --> 00:19:13,587
What's in this?

35
00:19:13,838 --> 00:19:15,435
Cheese and...
I don't know.

36
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:18,280
Meat by-products are prohibited
from entry in the United States.

37
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,336
Oh... Mama?

38
00:19:20,337 --> 00:19:21,702
Can you move it
a little bit?

39
00:19:21,978 --> 00:19:22,867
Mama?

40
00:19:27,474 --> 00:19:28,194
Fine.

41
00:19:28,399 --> 00:19:29,182
Narcotics?

42
00:19:29,927 --> 00:19:31,199
- Sorry?
- Heroin.

43
00:19:31,531 --> 00:19:35,473
- Cocaine, marijuana.
- No! No, no, of course not!

44
00:20:10,802 --> 00:20:11,593
Fadi!

45
00:20:20,234 --> 00:20:21,551
- How are you?
- Good.

46
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:23,908
- Hi, Aunty.
- Hello.

47
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:35,171
- Welcome to America!
- Thank you.

48
00:21:29,133 --> 00:21:30,507
It's a big country, Aunty.

49
00:22:10,488 --> 00:22:12,691
Mum says everyone
in America is fat.

50
00:22:12,972 --> 00:22:14,431
So maybe
you could fit in.

51
00:23:22,242 --> 00:23:24,231
This is my present.
Michel Arona.

52
00:23:29,319 --> 00:23:30,221
Zatar...

53
00:23:45,825 --> 00:23:47,877
Fadi... Fadi!

54
00:24:15,457 --> 00:24:16,801
Okay, get some sleep,
<i>habib.</i>

55
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,869
Fadi... Fadi!

56
00:25:00,015 --> 00:25:02,273
So, is there anything else
you can do?

57
00:25:03,237 --> 00:25:05,567
<i>You can file a report,
but that's about it.</i>

58
00:25:05,568 --> 00:25:07,706
<i>You can try back in
a few days if you want to.</i>

59
00:25:08,227 --> 00:25:08,959
Thanks.

60
00:25:57,115 --> 00:25:58,109
Mom...

61
00:26:49,267 --> 00:26:52,831
- <i>It's my room, too.</i>
- <i>No, it's not. Go away.</i>

62
00:27:44,252 --> 00:27:45,948
You have to take
an appointment.

63
00:28:35,514 --> 00:28:36,799
$23.24

64
00:28:51,803 --> 00:28:52,419
Thanks.

65
00:28:52,992 --> 00:28:53,808
Thank you.

66
00:29:10,655 --> 00:29:12,681
Kind of ugly,
but fine.

67
00:29:13,314 --> 00:29:15,789
Oh my God!
Definitely not!

68
00:29:17,611 --> 00:29:18,725
What you're doing?

69
00:29:19,518 --> 00:29:20,851
She's telling me
what to wear.

70
00:29:21,498 --> 00:29:23,763
Why? You don't know
what to wear?

71
00:29:24,285 --> 00:29:26,997
No, Aunty, because
he can't wear things like this.

72
00:29:27,743 --> 00:29:29,427
Why?
Just buy this for him.

73
00:29:29,724 --> 00:29:31,075
Aunty, they're pleaded.

74
00:29:36,177 --> 00:29:39,176
Do you know what will happen
if you wear this to school?

75
00:29:39,227 --> 00:29:39,788
What?

76
00:29:39,985 --> 00:29:41,692
He'll look like an FOB.

77
00:29:42,035 --> 00:29:43,995
- A what?
- Fresh of the boat.

78
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,803
What's that mean?

79
00:29:47,162 --> 00:29:48,840
What boat, <i>habiti</i>?

80
00:29:48,982 --> 00:29:50,641
It means he won't have
any friends.

81
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:53,447
What friends have to do
with his clothes?

82
00:29:53,658 --> 00:29:55,347
Only everything.

83
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,531
Arabic, English and French?

84
00:30:45,105 --> 00:30:47,115
Well, my French
isn't that good, but--

85
00:30:47,116 --> 00:30:49,073
<i>Him parler francais très bien.</i>
(He speaks French very well)

86
00:30:49,364 --> 00:30:50,497
Me too.

87
00:30:50,498 --> 00:30:52,764
We speak three language
and a half.

88
00:30:52,764 --> 00:30:55,034
Mom, I only know
the numbers in Hebrew.

89
00:30:55,035 --> 00:30:56,335
This is what
I said I have.

90
00:30:56,673 --> 00:30:59,733
<i>Mr. Novatski, the boys are writing
on the bathroom walls again.</i>

91
00:31:00,046 --> 00:31:01,804
Yeah, I'll--
I'll be there in a minute.

92
00:31:02,439 --> 00:31:04,183
Now, it says here
you went to private school.

93
00:31:04,218 --> 00:31:07,366
- Yeah, I did. It was--
- Yeah, it was so expensive.

94
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:08,725
But I manage.

95
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,268
I work in a bank
for ten years.

96
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,249
Well, his record
is very impressive.

97
00:31:14,329 --> 00:31:16,063
So you did something right.

98
00:31:16,561 --> 00:31:18,168
- Thank you.
- I have to say that he has

99
00:31:18,257 --> 00:31:20,123
more credits than
most of our graduates.

100
00:31:20,608 --> 00:31:23,339
Now, I assume that you're
planning on going to college.

101
00:31:23,374 --> 00:31:25,010
Yeah, I do.
I like arts

102
00:31:25,045 --> 00:31:27,075
so I thought of going
to some art college or like--

103
00:31:27,165 --> 00:31:29,022
No, no.
He will be a doctor.

104
00:31:29,273 --> 00:31:31,819
Like my sister-husband.
He's too smart.

105
00:31:33,128 --> 00:31:35,147
Right, well. Um...

106
00:31:35,182 --> 00:31:38,560
I see no reason
why Fadi shouldn't be able to

107
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,184
enter his junior year here.
We're lucky to have him.

108
00:31:41,219 --> 00:31:42,447
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

109
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:43,537
Thank you!

110
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,580
<i>Habibi!</i>

111
00:31:51,032 --> 00:31:52,903
Come on, people.
Who read the assignment?

112
00:31:52,904 --> 00:31:54,712
They targetted aliens
with ties--

113
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:57,923
C-- Come in.

114
00:32:06,184 --> 00:32:08,068
Fatty Farrah?

115
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:10,024
It's Fadi.

116
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:12,836
Isn't that what I said?

117
00:32:13,841 --> 00:32:15,176
I take it
that's your mom.

118
00:32:17,265 --> 00:32:18,694
Dude, check it out.

119
00:32:18,865 --> 00:32:19,949
Have a seat.

120
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:22,526
Welcome to Current World Issues.
I'm Mr. Jones.

121
00:32:23,836 --> 00:32:25,028
Where you joining us from?

122
00:32:25,499 --> 00:32:28,414
- Louis Bank.
- He's my cousin.

123
00:32:30,227 --> 00:32:32,093
So what's your take
on what's going on over there?

124
00:32:34,651 --> 00:32:37,497
Well, there needs to be an end to
the occupation first of all and--

125
00:32:37,532 --> 00:32:39,030
We want to hear
what Fatty thinks.

126
00:32:39,151 --> 00:32:40,284
Yeah... Fatty.

127
00:32:41,795 --> 00:32:44,630
Well, I guess I agree
with Sanma.

128
00:32:51,416 --> 00:32:54,962
- Muna Farrah.
- Yeah. I'm she.

129
00:32:55,042 --> 00:32:57,095
- Hi. Hi.
- Hello. Right this way.

130
00:32:57,096 --> 00:32:57,717
Thank you.

131
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,489
Please.

132
00:33:05,235 --> 00:33:06,383
So what can I help you
with today?

133
00:33:06,755 --> 00:33:07,972
I came here for a job.

134
00:33:08,857 --> 00:33:10,521
- Excuse me?
- A job.

135
00:33:10,754 --> 00:33:11,710
I would like a job.

136
00:33:12,621 --> 00:33:15,152
I-I'm sorry. I thought
you wanted to open an account.

137
00:33:15,833 --> 00:33:17,629
I came from Palestine.

138
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:18,702
You know her?

139
00:33:19,175 --> 00:33:20,902
- Who?
- Palestine!

140
00:33:20,903 --> 00:33:22,879
Is that
a Jewish-speaking country?

141
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,597
No. Arabic.
I'm an Arab.

142
00:33:24,632 --> 00:33:26,937
Oh... don't blow the place up.

143
00:33:28,201 --> 00:33:29,456
I'm just kidding.

144
00:33:29,568 --> 00:33:32,160
Actually, we're not really
hiring at this time.

145
00:33:32,195 --> 00:33:36,497
I have a long experience.
You can see from my resume.

146
00:33:36,881 --> 00:33:37,639
Here. Please.

147
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:40,769
Great, we'll certainly
keep this on file.

148
00:33:40,804 --> 00:33:42,955
And also I came here
because my sister--

149
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:44,437
She had account
with you.

150
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:49,315
I promise if you give me a job,
I will open my account also here.

151
00:33:49,416 --> 00:33:50,900
We'll keep that in mind.

152
00:33:53,653 --> 00:33:54,796
Thank you.

153
00:34:08,779 --> 00:34:11,663
<i>Thank you for calling...
How can I help you?</i>

154
00:34:11,698 --> 00:34:14,378
Hi. You look for, uh...
a book-keeper?

155
00:34:15,218 --> 00:34:16,207
<i>You're looking for who?</i>

156
00:34:16,378 --> 00:34:18,911
I'm interested
in a book-keeper job.

157
00:34:20,115 --> 00:34:22,519
It's written here
in the newspaper.

158
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:24,462
<i>That position's been filled.</i>

159
00:34:25,315 --> 00:34:27,667
Hmm... Thank you.

160
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:07,006
No fair. Your parts are
much bigger than mine.

161
00:37:07,217 --> 00:37:09,077
I'm older, so live with it.

162
00:37:11,309 --> 00:37:14,317
Aunty, Lamis won't let me
leave this part of the room.

163
00:37:14,637 --> 00:37:16,237
I can't even get to the door!

164
00:37:16,238 --> 00:37:17,733
Is it true, Lamis?

165
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:20,452
- No, I was just kidding. God!
- No, she's not.

166
00:37:20,453 --> 00:37:22,555
She's gonna put the tape
back there when you leave.

167
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:24,459
No, she won't.
She's a good girl.

168
00:37:30,726 --> 00:37:32,140
Tattle-tail.

169
00:38:17,732 --> 00:38:19,048
Mama...

170
00:38:19,759 --> 00:38:20,618
Mom!

171
00:38:22,586 --> 00:38:24,288
Can I have
lunch money, please?

172
00:38:25,905 --> 00:38:27,209
Lunch money?

173
00:38:59,232 --> 00:39:02,918
<i>American marines have dragged
the iconic statue of Saddam Hussein</i>

174
00:39:02,953 --> 00:39:05,232
- <i>off its pedestal...</i>
- So what does this mean? Is it over?

175
00:39:05,464 --> 00:39:07,669
Are you kidding?
It's just the beginning.

176
00:39:08,142 --> 00:39:09,886
The Americans
are going to get in there

177
00:39:09,921 --> 00:39:11,649
and destabilize
the whole region.

178
00:39:13,056 --> 00:39:14,926
Mom, this is disgusting.

179
00:39:15,867 --> 00:39:16,848
Mom, I love it!

180
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:19,810
Just push the cauliflower aside.
That's what I do.

181
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:21,207
It all tastes so good.

182
00:39:21,498 --> 00:39:22,644
You're too thin.

183
00:39:23,087 --> 00:39:24,406
Where's my mom,
by the way?

184
00:39:25,687 --> 00:39:27,959
So what-- Are the Iraqis happy
that Saddam is gone?

185
00:39:28,263 --> 00:39:31,259
I'll give you some particular advice
if you don't like the way it was done.

186
00:39:31,294 --> 00:39:32,297
Can I get up?

187
00:39:35,115 --> 00:39:36,319
I can't hear!

188
00:39:46,464 --> 00:39:47,771
I got a job.

189
00:39:53,541 --> 00:39:57,141
- Where, Aunty?
- In the United Alliance Bank.

190
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,597
What will you be doing?

191
00:39:59,607 --> 00:40:02,646
Working in office.
Administration.

192
00:40:03,477 --> 00:40:04,611
When do you start, Mom?

193
00:40:04,897 --> 00:40:05,895
When you start--

194
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:36,109
- Then bye.
- Bye.

195
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:56,522
Hi. Can I help you?

196
00:40:57,015 --> 00:40:57,929
I wish.

197
00:41:19,016 --> 00:41:19,982
Good morning.

198
00:41:21,798 --> 00:41:23,454
It's my first day.

199
00:41:23,585 --> 00:41:26,252
- Wait-- You work here?
- Yes.

200
00:41:27,045 --> 00:41:27,929
I'm Muna.

201
00:41:28,654 --> 00:41:29,478
Matt.

202
00:41:30,027 --> 00:41:32,652
Matt?
Your name is Matt?

203
00:41:35,383 --> 00:41:37,870
Do you know
what it means in Arabic?

204
00:41:39,055 --> 00:41:41,655
I know it's not "God is great"
but it's what I am.

205
00:41:41,904 --> 00:41:45,023
It means dead.
You are dead.

206
00:41:46,821 --> 00:41:47,664
Cool.

207
00:41:48,378 --> 00:41:51,764
Imagine that someone
invaded America, alright?

208
00:41:51,799 --> 00:41:53,402
And then
the people resisted...

209
00:41:53,493 --> 00:41:54,501
Would we be terrorists?

210
00:41:54,536 --> 00:41:56,315
No. See that's completely
different, though.

211
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:57,614
- No, it's not.
- It is because

212
00:41:57,665 --> 00:41:59,824
we wouldn't blow ourselves up
killing innocent people.

213
00:41:59,859 --> 00:42:01,067
Because you wouldn't have to.

214
00:42:01,156 --> 00:42:03,405
Alright, because you have
fighter jets in your backyard.

215
00:42:03,275 --> 00:42:05,963
We didn't invade them.
We were over there trying to help them.

216
00:42:05,998 --> 00:42:06,723
How?

217
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:08,662
By starving them?
By killing them?

218
00:42:08,744 --> 00:42:10,781
My brother is over there
trying to give them a chance

219
00:42:10,832 --> 00:42:12,390
- at freedom.
- If you believe that,

220
00:42:12,425 --> 00:42:13,917
I seriously feel sorry
for you.

221
00:42:14,168 --> 00:42:15,692
- You seriously feel--
- Okay. Okay.

222
00:42:15,727 --> 00:42:17,664
Let's open this up.
What do the rest of you think?

223
00:42:18,127 --> 00:42:20,104
What are the reasons
behind terrorism?

224
00:42:20,525 --> 00:42:23,447
Political injustice
and resistance to occupation.

225
00:42:23,482 --> 00:42:25,495
Just give someone else
a chance, okay?

226
00:42:31,099 --> 00:42:31,709
Fadi.

227
00:42:33,564 --> 00:42:36,428
- You would ask him.
- I'm sorry.

228
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:38,044
What? What was that?

229
00:42:41,244 --> 00:42:44,307
It seems Salma would rather
I refrain from questioning Fadi.

230
00:42:44,308 --> 00:42:45,902
Probably cause he's got
something to hide.

231
00:42:45,937 --> 00:42:48,043
Yeah, well, maybe he's planning
to blow the school up.

232
00:42:48,961 --> 00:42:51,465
- Hey, that's enough.
- That's so racist.

233
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:54,039
What, so you think they taught him
to build bombs in the second grade?

234
00:42:54,074 --> 00:42:55,585
Yeah, you people
are clueless.

235
00:42:55,917 --> 00:42:57,812
- Really?
- Okay, okay, that's enough.

236
00:42:58,418 --> 00:42:59,902
Let's get back on track.

237
00:43:00,722 --> 00:43:02,011
Somebody else.
Come on.

238
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:05,352
Welcome to the White Castle.

239
00:43:05,495 --> 00:43:07,857
Would you like
a case of graving?

240
00:43:09,773 --> 00:43:12,946
No, it's... "Would you like
to try our crave case?"

241
00:43:14,483 --> 00:43:16,009
This what I say.

242
00:43:17,907 --> 00:43:20,186
- You're such a fat pig!
- Fuck off!

243
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:21,977
Why they aren't at school?

244
00:43:23,181 --> 00:43:25,228
Let's just stick with
"Welcome to White Castle."

245
00:43:44,673 --> 00:43:47,356
I'm sorry, there's no one
here named Muna.

246
00:43:47,357 --> 00:43:49,404
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

247
00:43:49,505 --> 00:43:50,979
I mean, if you want,
I can ask.

248
00:43:51,014 --> 00:43:52,949
- But I'm pretty positive.
- Yes, please.

249
00:43:53,168 --> 00:43:54,770
- What's your name?
- Raghda.

250
00:43:54,981 --> 00:43:57,198
- I beg your pardon.
- Ra-ghda.

251
00:43:57,571 --> 00:43:58,914
Rag-dha?

252
00:43:58,983 --> 00:44:01,269
- Yes, Ragdha, yes.
- I'm sorry I'm late.

253
00:44:01,318 --> 00:44:03,373
- Muna.
- I was in the store

254
00:44:03,433 --> 00:44:06,116
to buy some medicine.
I have a headache.

255
00:44:06,606 --> 00:44:08,224
Maybe too much thinking.

256
00:44:08,225 --> 00:44:12,115
- You were here this morning.
- Yes. Muna, my name is Muna.

257
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:15,895
See you tomorrow.

258
00:44:16,078 --> 00:44:17,024
Thank you.

259
00:45:30,501 --> 00:45:31,742
I don't care.

260
00:45:44,335 --> 00:45:46,239
But you don't listen.

261
00:46:16,008 --> 00:46:16,883
You know that.

262
00:46:39,111 --> 00:46:41,347
Nabeel. Nabeel!

263
00:47:30,356 --> 00:47:31,859
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Momma?

264
00:47:31,894 --> 00:47:32,694
<i>Muna!</i>

265
00:48:19,046 --> 00:48:20,774
Nice!

266
00:48:24,875 --> 00:48:26,320
They couldn't even
spell it right.

267
00:48:47,193 --> 00:48:48,023
Nelson...

268
00:48:49,115 --> 00:48:50,852
I make more than this.

269
00:48:51,137 --> 00:48:52,015
Taxes, Muna.

270
00:48:52,799 --> 00:48:54,820
That much for taxes?

271
00:48:58,122 --> 00:48:59,455
I see hungry people.

272
00:49:00,769 --> 00:49:02,115
One minute, please.

273
00:49:03,169 --> 00:49:05,719
Listen, it's a big problem
for me.

274
00:49:06,027 --> 00:49:07,492
I need the money now!

275
00:49:08,455 --> 00:49:10,114
Maybe I can take
an advance.

276
00:49:13,682 --> 00:49:14,783
Nelson...

277
00:49:15,091 --> 00:49:16,761
We should really teach
the guy a lesson, then.

278
00:49:17,033 --> 00:49:18,086
We should kick his ass.

279
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,259
Being anti-warrior,
you're kinda violent.

280
00:49:29,317 --> 00:49:31,288
But yeah,
we should definitely kick his ass.

281
00:49:32,083 --> 00:49:33,383
- What do you say?
- No.

282
00:49:33,418 --> 00:49:35,094
It only make
Mike more pissed off.

283
00:49:35,450 --> 00:49:37,809
I think we should give him
a dose of his own medicine, you know?

284
00:49:37,844 --> 00:49:39,579
Yeah, man.
You gotta stop being so nice.

285
00:49:39,979 --> 00:49:41,185
Toughen up, you know.

286
00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:44,212
Show those guys
who's boss.

287
00:49:44,247 --> 00:49:45,255
How?

288
00:49:55,509 --> 00:49:56,514
You okay?

289
00:49:57,584 --> 00:49:58,583
You were good enough.

290
00:49:58,618 --> 00:50:00,043
First learn
how to smoke a joint.

291
00:50:00,134 --> 00:50:03,165
I smoked one...
one before. Sort of.

292
00:50:03,770 --> 00:50:06,244
Okay, not really.
But I thought about it.

293
00:50:06,645 --> 00:50:08,271
Dude, you need
some major help.

294
00:50:08,621 --> 00:50:09,724
Take off that jacket.

295
00:50:09,725 --> 00:50:10,991
- Why?
- Just take it off.

296
00:50:11,026 --> 00:50:12,257
You look horrible.
Just take it off.

297
00:50:13,525 --> 00:50:14,897
Untuck your shirt.

298
00:50:15,034 --> 00:50:16,282
Yeah.
Oh, I got something!

299
00:50:16,283 --> 00:50:17,055
I got something.

300
00:50:17,687 --> 00:50:19,412
You gotta wear your shit
loose, you know?

301
00:50:19,447 --> 00:50:20,218
Okay.

302
00:50:20,219 --> 00:50:21,270
Like you don't
give a shit.

303
00:50:21,271 --> 00:50:22,887
Okay. Try this one.

304
00:50:26,094 --> 00:50:27,388
I like that.

305
00:50:27,555 --> 00:50:28,356
- Yeah.
- It's nice?

306
00:50:28,391 --> 00:50:29,600
It's alright.

307
00:50:30,253 --> 00:50:31,358
Try that, though.

308
00:50:34,025 --> 00:50:35,700
- Nice!
- That's perfect.

309
00:50:36,107 --> 00:50:37,317
It's perfect.

310
00:50:37,688 --> 00:50:40,197
- Yeah? Hardcore, like this.
- Yeah.

311
00:50:40,896 --> 00:50:42,609
Yeah, like you know shit.

312
00:50:43,856 --> 00:50:48,387
- Go, Fadi. Go, Fadi.
- Go, Fadi. Oh, yeah.

313
00:51:04,724 --> 00:51:06,665
I'm keeping one
beside the door.

314
00:51:07,016 --> 00:51:08,449
And one beside my bed.

315
00:51:12,603 --> 00:51:13,885
Who plays baseball?

316
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:25,860
Mom...

317
00:51:26,242 --> 00:51:28,486
Does Dad live
in the basement now?

318
00:51:34,036 --> 00:51:36,283
Well, please stop laughing.

319
00:51:36,756 --> 00:51:39,981
- I'm not the one laughing.
- You're the one laughing!

320
00:51:40,016 --> 00:51:41,892
She steals
all the covers in bed.

321
00:51:42,254 --> 00:51:45,318
She's like Godzilla in the...
in the bedroom.

322
00:51:45,778 --> 00:51:48,823
Moms-- they have
some love in their...

323
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:51,592
- Yeah.
- ...their hearts.

324
00:51:51,995 --> 00:51:53,831
Dude, man,
I'm messed up.

325
00:51:53,852 --> 00:51:57,776
You say "dude" too much, man.
You're all American and shit.

326
00:52:00,911 --> 00:52:03,881
Dude, you sleep
with your mom?

327
00:52:03,882 --> 00:52:05,702
Yeah, I've been...

328
00:52:06,004 --> 00:52:09,247
- It's not cool.
- Cause that shit will mess you up.

329
00:52:09,282 --> 00:52:11,227
- Seriously. Dude, I'm just saying.
- Why do you always care about sex?

330
00:52:11,228 --> 00:52:13,174
- It will mess you up.
- What do you think about in your head?

331
00:52:13,209 --> 00:52:14,309
Or what
do you care about?

332
00:52:14,672 --> 00:52:16,429
Number one, sex,
number one...

333
00:52:16,819 --> 00:52:18,573
Cheeseburgers,
number two.

334
00:52:19,597 --> 00:52:21,233
Double with bacon...

335
00:52:21,815 --> 00:52:23,581
Hey! You came from sex.

336
00:52:24,830 --> 00:52:26,968
Dude, I don't wanna have it in me.
I don't wanna have it.

337
00:52:26,969 --> 00:52:29,156
Yo, guys.
Check who's here?

338
00:52:29,368 --> 00:52:31,009
- Who's here?
- Mike.

339
00:52:31,491 --> 00:52:33,006
Oh, shit.
Are you serious?

340
00:52:36,063 --> 00:52:39,191
- Okay.
- I hate that guy.

341
00:52:39,192 --> 00:52:40,365
- Seriously.
- Yeah, me too.

342
00:52:43,382 --> 00:52:44,687
Do you guys
wanna have some fun?

343
00:52:58,695 --> 00:53:00,090
I feel I don't think
it's a good idea.

344
00:53:01,105 --> 00:53:02,189
What if someone
sees us?

345
00:53:02,190 --> 00:53:03,211
Who cares?

346
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:09,083
Hurry up,
someone's coming.

347
00:53:09,605 --> 00:53:10,436
Run!

348
00:53:14,184 --> 00:53:15,884
Go, go, go, go, go!

349
00:53:29,243 --> 00:53:31,863
You're dead now.
You're dead now, you fuck.

350
00:53:45,530 --> 00:53:47,115
"Opportunity"...

351
00:53:49,105 --> 00:53:50,468
"Click here to show"...

352
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:54,901
<i>Work from home.</i>

353
00:53:55,012 --> 00:53:58,978
<i>Achieve your dreams!
Lose weight... earn a living.</i>

354
00:53:59,475 --> 00:54:01,069
<i>The herbalist respect.</i>

355
00:54:17,370 --> 00:54:19,224
Oh so um...
my mom heard me

356
00:54:19,259 --> 00:54:21,946
talking to James on the phone
and she like, totally fucked up.

357
00:54:21,981 --> 00:54:23,511
So don't even mention
his name, alright?

358
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:35,439
Where have you been?

359
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,350
Oh my God. Jesus!

360
00:54:37,724 --> 00:54:39,107
Mom, what are you doing?

361
00:54:39,427 --> 00:54:42,438
Where have you been, Aunty?
We're so worried.

362
00:54:42,716 --> 00:54:44,095
Oh, we just went
to a movie.

363
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:46,732
Who went with you?

364
00:54:47,676 --> 00:54:49,292
No one.
It was just us two.

365
00:54:49,293 --> 00:54:51,269
With James.
He wasn't there?

366
00:54:53,854 --> 00:54:56,421
You are grounded one month.

367
00:54:56,837 --> 00:54:58,435
What?!
This is ridiculous!

368
00:54:58,470 --> 00:55:00,438
Aunty, Jim is
a friend of mine.

369
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:06,113
Drinking with drugs,
or God knows what.

370
00:55:06,148 --> 00:55:08,106
God, is that all you think
that people do here?

371
00:55:08,141 --> 00:55:09,839
- Yes.
- Well, here's a shocker, Mom.

372
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,910
We live in America.
We're American!

373
00:55:13,164 --> 00:55:16,136
As long as you live in this house,
you live in Palestine!

374
00:55:16,137 --> 00:55:17,266
You're delusional!

375
00:55:40,797 --> 00:55:41,576
Fadi...

376
00:55:44,275 --> 00:55:45,239
Then don't.

377
00:55:55,465 --> 00:55:57,137
Because you snore.

378
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,322
Then go sleep
and get out of my grill.

379
00:56:16,196 --> 00:56:17,278
Since now.

380
00:56:53,288 --> 00:56:54,837
I'm homeless.

381
00:56:57,697 --> 00:57:00,633
- It's your home.
- It's Mum and Dad's home.

382
00:57:00,684 --> 00:57:02,610
I have no control
over it.

383
00:57:05,431 --> 00:57:06,997
Lamis doesn't want me
in her room

384
00:57:07,068 --> 00:57:09,666
and I'm sick of living with someone
who doesn't want me.

385
00:57:11,524 --> 00:57:15,036
- She wishes I was never born.
- No, no, it's not true.

386
00:57:16,903 --> 00:57:19,491
Why don't you come back
with me to your room?

387
00:57:19,699 --> 00:57:21,250
It's your room now.

388
00:57:21,362 --> 00:57:22,697
We can share it.

389
00:57:23,477 --> 00:57:25,524
Fadi's just sleeping
at the couch.

390
00:57:28,956 --> 00:57:29,755
Come on.

391
00:57:52,514 --> 00:57:55,056
Welcome to White Castle.
How can I help you?

392
00:57:55,418 --> 00:57:59,306
I'll have the... number four
with chicken wings.

393
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:02,052
And diet coke.

394
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:06,215
You like to lose weight?

395
00:58:07,525 --> 00:58:08,519
Excuse me?

396
00:58:08,998 --> 00:58:11,654
You like me...
We're fat in the middle.

397
00:58:12,442 --> 00:58:15,563
You need this...
Herbal Lose.

398
00:58:16,115 --> 00:58:18,135
You know, we need help
at the grill.

399
00:58:25,561 --> 00:58:27,222
You gotta pay
for what you did, bro.

400
00:58:27,257 --> 00:58:28,406
I don't need this.

401
00:58:29,901 --> 00:58:31,515
- Man, I don't want to fight with you, okay?
- You want to fight with me?

402
00:58:31,516 --> 00:58:33,301
Well, you should have thought of it
before you messed with my truck!

403
00:58:33,336 --> 00:58:34,524
I didn't mess
with your truck!

404
00:58:47,816 --> 00:58:49,382
Hey, Muna.
There's someone here for you.

405
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:52,306
I'm sorry to bother you.

406
00:58:52,307 --> 00:58:53,801
Your sister's at the bank.

407
00:58:53,932 --> 00:58:56,369
- Yes?
- I told here you were out to lunch.

408
00:58:56,822 --> 00:58:57,884
I hope that's okay.

409
00:58:58,148 --> 00:59:00,403
She said your son got into
some trouble at school.

410
00:59:02,743 --> 00:59:03,994
One minute, okay?

411
00:59:26,673 --> 00:59:27,570
What happened?

412
00:59:27,892 --> 00:59:29,216
Well, he got into a fight.

413
00:59:29,548 --> 00:59:32,792
There's some... bruising
but I don't think it's too bad.

414
00:59:38,917 --> 00:59:39,904
Some asshole.

415
00:59:39,905 --> 00:59:41,203
Why did
they beat you in?

416
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:42,707
Up, Mom, up!

417
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:44,252
Up, in...

418
00:59:46,268 --> 00:59:48,867
Just... don't worry about it.
It's my problem.

419
00:59:49,088 --> 00:59:50,526
And you are
my problem.

420
00:59:50,561 --> 00:59:52,491
I don't want to be
your fucking problem.

421
00:59:52,526 --> 00:59:54,410
Fadi, have some respect.

422
00:59:58,758 --> 01:00:00,771
Nothing. Just...
don't want to be here.

423
01:00:02,075 --> 01:00:02,778
Home.

424
01:00:03,169 --> 01:00:05,692
Just somewhere where people
aren't stupid enough to think

425
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:06,832
I'll blow myself up.

426
01:00:10,572 --> 01:00:11,969
Who said that?

427
01:00:14,037 --> 01:00:15,447
Can I go to class now?

428
01:00:17,002 --> 01:00:18,218
Yeah, sure.

429
01:00:35,902 --> 01:00:37,715
You're alright?
You need a ride?

430
01:00:38,161 --> 01:00:40,883
No, thank you.
I'm looking for my sister.

431
01:00:41,121 --> 01:00:43,761
She said she have
to pick up the dry-cleaning.

432
01:00:44,866 --> 01:00:47,696
And I'm too late for work.

433
01:00:47,833 --> 01:00:49,238
Well, my car is right here.

434
01:00:49,970 --> 01:00:51,511
No, no. Thank you, no.

435
01:00:51,546 --> 01:00:52,716
Why don't you let me
drive you?

436
01:00:53,076 --> 01:00:55,645
- It's no trouble.
- No, no. I'll wait...

437
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:58,404
Please. Come on,
I'd be happy to. Come on.

438
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:01,039
Thank you.

439
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:03,904
Got a whole mess in there.

440
01:01:05,053 --> 01:01:06,268
Don't worry.

441
01:01:14,636 --> 01:01:17,288
You know... I think
you're seeing the worst of it,

442
01:01:17,323 --> 01:01:19,090
Mrs. Farrah, I really do.

443
01:01:19,191 --> 01:01:20,854
Kids just don't know
any better.

444
01:01:22,639 --> 01:01:25,367
You know, they hear about
one Muslim extremist...

445
01:01:25,402 --> 01:01:28,917
Suddenly, all Muslims
are extremists.

446
01:01:28,918 --> 01:01:30,912
- But they are not.
- Of course, they're not.

447
01:01:35,059 --> 01:01:36,980
We are not Muslim even.

448
01:01:38,514 --> 01:01:40,864
I'm sorry.
I-- I just assumed.

449
01:01:40,924 --> 01:01:42,926
It doesn't matter.

450
01:01:42,927 --> 01:01:45,746
We are a minority here
and a minority there.

451
01:01:48,129 --> 01:01:49,254
I can relate.

452
01:01:49,947 --> 01:01:52,118
Not many Polish-Jews
around here.

453
01:01:55,118 --> 01:01:56,624
You are a Jewish?

454
01:01:59,568 --> 01:02:02,318
- You came from Poland?
- Well, not me.

455
01:02:02,690 --> 01:02:04,939
My grandparents.
I was born here.

456
01:02:22,202 --> 01:02:24,925
So... you play chess?

457
01:02:25,757 --> 01:02:27,337
Yeah.
Every now and then.

458
01:02:27,372 --> 01:02:29,681
I was on the chess team
in college.

459
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:32,815
You know
we invent the chess?

460
01:02:33,729 --> 01:02:35,672
- "We?" Who's "we?"
- The Arab.

461
01:02:35,994 --> 01:02:37,430
- Really?
- Yeah.

462
01:02:37,465 --> 01:02:38,770
No, I had no idea.

463
01:02:38,930 --> 01:02:44,065
Yes, Oni said, "Checkmate--
It comes from the Arabic."

464
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:48,028
<i>Sheikh matt.</i>
Which means the king is dead.

465
01:02:49,496 --> 01:02:51,559
- Is that right?
- Yes.

466
01:02:51,761 --> 01:02:53,537
I never heard that before.

467
01:02:55,112 --> 01:02:56,298
<i>Sheikh matt.</i>

468
01:02:56,758 --> 01:02:59,448
- <i>Sheikh matt.</i>
- <i>Sheikh matt.</i>

469
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:02,574
So you speak the Arabic
without knowing that.

470
01:03:05,219 --> 01:03:06,804
Thank you so much.

471
01:03:06,805 --> 01:03:09,717
Oh, you tell Fadi
to hang in there.

472
01:03:10,289 --> 01:03:11,302
He will.

473
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:14,227
He's lucky to have you,
you know.

474
01:03:15,692 --> 01:03:18,954
You tell him this
before God this day.

475
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:21,102
Thank you.

476
01:04:00,404 --> 01:04:02,578
They make
a good hamburger here.

477
01:04:03,472 --> 01:04:04,648
You know why?

478
01:04:06,587 --> 01:04:09,643
They cook it on
top of the onion.

479
01:04:10,626 --> 01:04:13,549
- It's delicious.
- I can bring you more!

480
01:04:13,584 --> 01:04:15,226
Oh, no, no, no.
Thanks. This is plenty.

481
01:04:15,227 --> 01:04:18,188
No, no, it's okay.
You can take it for your family.

482
01:04:18,189 --> 01:04:20,568
No. I live alone.
I'm divorced.

483
01:04:21,824 --> 01:04:22,849
Yeah, me too.

484
01:04:23,189 --> 01:04:25,372
I was married for eleven years.

485
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:30,341
And my husband--
All what he brings me is a headache.

486
01:04:36,795 --> 01:04:37,900
Would you like some?

487
01:04:39,498 --> 01:04:43,536
No, no, no. No, it's okay.
I just started my diet today.

488
01:04:43,777 --> 01:04:46,384
I take Herbal Loss.
It's good!

489
01:04:47,237 --> 01:04:51,613
- Do you like it?
- Yeah, it's-- It's good.

490
01:04:53,018 --> 01:04:54,401
You can have more.

491
01:04:55,375 --> 01:04:58,151
- I sell it.
- I'd love to buy some.

492
01:04:58,818 --> 01:05:00,224
- Really?
- Yeah!

493
01:05:00,225 --> 01:05:02,073
I mean, I could stand
to lose a few pounds.

494
01:05:02,284 --> 01:05:03,680
You can buy it all!

495
01:05:12,158 --> 01:05:16,620
So... what happened
to your marriage?

496
01:05:19,138 --> 01:05:22,378
Well, he just
found another woman.

497
01:05:23,761 --> 01:05:24,678
I am gone.

498
01:05:25,149 --> 01:05:27,291
He look like this.

499
01:05:29,645 --> 01:05:31,784
She made me look
so fat.

500
01:05:33,983 --> 01:05:35,602
You're not at all fat.

501
01:05:37,883 --> 01:05:39,000
Thank you.

502
01:05:43,673 --> 01:05:44,632
L-- Listen.

503
01:05:45,476 --> 01:05:48,834
I wish you don't say
anything to my family

504
01:05:48,904 --> 01:05:50,104
you see me here.

505
01:05:51,007 --> 01:05:52,312
I won't say a word.

506
01:05:52,642 --> 01:05:54,233
They will not like it.

507
01:05:55,101 --> 01:05:56,706
I don't like it too.

508
01:05:57,227 --> 01:06:00,862
I have two degrees
in ten years experience

509
01:06:01,354 --> 01:06:03,129
and in this country,

510
01:06:03,823 --> 01:06:07,110
all this get me is...
a hamburger.

511
01:06:28,313 --> 01:06:30,342
Everything okay
with your son?

512
01:06:31,537 --> 01:06:33,383
Oh, yeah. Okay.

513
01:06:34,526 --> 01:06:36,291
They gave him a black eye.

514
01:06:37,707 --> 01:06:39,262
I'm sorry to hear that.

515
01:06:40,908 --> 01:06:43,584
I wanted to let you know
I looked into a credit card for you,

516
01:06:43,619 --> 01:06:45,300
- like you asked.
- You did?

517
01:06:45,778 --> 01:06:49,538
I found one that you qualify for,
but the APR is kind of high.

518
01:06:50,050 --> 01:06:52,469
- It's okay.
- Well, great!

519
01:06:52,867 --> 01:06:55,415
Come on back and we'll see
if we can get you approved.

520
01:06:55,878 --> 01:06:56,737
Thank you.

521
01:07:16,551 --> 01:07:17,387
Please...

522
01:07:18,591 --> 01:07:20,701
I don't speak much
these days.

523
01:07:21,849 --> 01:07:22,989
Please don't...

524
01:07:49,538 --> 01:07:51,124
Accidental bombing...

525
01:08:26,104 --> 01:08:27,626
We have to live our life.

526
01:08:29,101 --> 01:08:31,208
I start to believe
Raghda was right.

527
01:08:34,814 --> 01:08:36,100
To go where?

528
01:08:42,142 --> 01:08:43,241
It was successful.

529
01:08:53,583 --> 01:08:55,018
<i>Yani</i>, don't worry.

530
01:08:58,199 --> 01:08:59,534
I will help you with that.

531
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:15,339
But I need you
to do something for me.

532
01:09:47,922 --> 01:09:48,505
Sorry.

533
01:10:01,780 --> 01:10:02,623
Okay...

534
01:10:02,955 --> 01:10:06,146
- We put a little bit tahini.
- Come on!

535
01:10:08,855 --> 01:10:10,800
Next time, I will make it
with Arabic salad.

536
01:10:10,835 --> 01:10:13,910
- Okay.
- Tomato... cucumber...

537
01:10:19,602 --> 01:10:20,577
Yeah, yeah.

538
01:10:20,869 --> 01:10:23,498
- This is good stuff.
- I told you.

539
01:10:24,070 --> 01:10:25,794
Seriously though,
you can add something here.

540
01:10:25,829 --> 01:10:26,493
Must be like...

541
01:10:27,526 --> 01:10:29,623
White Castle's
New Falafel Burger!

542
01:10:29,789 --> 01:10:30,969
- Oh yeah.
- Yeah.

543
01:10:31,004 --> 01:10:33,484
- For vegetarian, why not?
- Yeah.

544
01:10:34,349 --> 01:10:38,147
So, how you say 'delicious'
in Arabic?

545
01:10:41,313 --> 01:10:43,802
- <i>Zaki.</i>
- <i>Zaaki?</i>

546
01:10:45,086 --> 01:10:48,817
Well, that is so <i>zaaki.</i>

547
01:10:52,502 --> 01:10:53,654
Cheers!

548
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:08,427
Why you do like this?

549
01:11:10,827 --> 01:11:11,853
Why, you don't like it?

550
01:11:12,982 --> 01:11:14,493
No, I like it.

551
01:11:17,710 --> 01:11:19,461
I don't know. I guess
I think it's cool.

552
01:11:19,943 --> 01:11:20,950
Makes me different.

553
01:11:23,147 --> 01:11:24,548
You like to be different?

554
01:11:25,030 --> 01:11:27,910
Well, yeah. Like why would I want to be
just like everybody else, you know?

555
01:11:27,911 --> 01:11:29,514
It's what I hated
about high school.

556
01:11:29,549 --> 01:11:32,983
It's that... you're punished
if you don't fit in. It's stupid.

557
01:11:33,201 --> 01:11:34,191
It's why I dropped out.

558
01:11:35,404 --> 01:11:36,789
You dropped from school?

559
01:11:37,643 --> 01:11:38,887
Yeah, it's not
a big deal though, like,

560
01:11:38,887 --> 01:11:40,081
I'm still gonna
get my GED.

561
01:11:40,082 --> 01:11:41,511
It's-- I don't want
to go to high school.

562
01:11:41,580 --> 01:11:42,710
It's too much of bullshit.

563
01:11:47,932 --> 01:11:49,004
Don't-- Don't fuck me like that.

564
01:11:49,055 --> 01:11:50,414
I can't go to my uncle--

565
01:12:02,523 --> 01:12:03,814
Two cheeseburgers...

566
01:12:07,921 --> 01:12:11,055
Hey. Hey, um...
How's your son?

567
01:12:11,928 --> 01:12:12,800
You know my son?

568
01:12:12,801 --> 01:12:15,357
Yeah, I know-- Yeah, I know
everybody knows Osama.

569
01:12:16,974 --> 01:12:19,889
- Nice one!
- $8.99.

570
01:12:33,709 --> 01:12:35,224
Tell your son
that I said hi.

571
01:12:35,816 --> 01:12:37,227
Take your food and go away.

572
01:12:39,636 --> 01:12:42,633
This is a free country.
I don't have to go anywhere.

573
01:12:42,683 --> 01:12:45,344
- Why don't you get out of here?
- Go back where you came from, okay?

574
01:12:45,379 --> 01:12:46,106
You guys just go.

575
01:12:46,141 --> 01:12:47,700
You shut the hell up, faggot.

576
01:12:47,735 --> 01:12:49,091
Shame on you.
Have some respect.

577
01:12:49,453 --> 01:12:51,666
Go away from here.
I will call the police now.

578
01:12:51,854 --> 01:12:53,271
Go away! Go!

579
01:12:53,790 --> 01:12:54,379
Go!

580
01:13:03,396 --> 01:13:04,287
I said go!

581
01:13:12,826 --> 01:13:15,153
Jesus! Are you okay?
Muna?

582
01:13:21,671 --> 01:13:23,851
Okay, I see a van.
Does he drive a van?

583
01:13:24,245 --> 01:13:26,741
- Yeah.
- Okay. Yeah, here, here.

584
01:13:36,605 --> 01:13:37,837
Why didn't you call
the ambulance?

585
01:13:37,888 --> 01:13:39,100
I tried.
She wouldn't let me.

586
01:13:39,101 --> 01:13:40,593
It's okay.
I don't have any...

587
01:13:42,388 --> 01:13:45,199
No, no, no, no!
Just relax and stay where you are.

588
01:13:45,669 --> 01:13:47,301
I'm going to check
a few things.

589
01:13:47,572 --> 01:13:48,255
Okay.

590
01:13:54,109 --> 01:13:57,041
They said
they know my son.

591
01:13:57,222 --> 01:13:59,248
- You have any tingling?
- No.

592
01:13:59,759 --> 01:14:01,221
- How about now?
- No.

593
01:14:04,149 --> 01:14:05,791
<i>Wallahi,</i>
it's not a big deal.

594
01:14:05,792 --> 01:14:07,751
I don't know.
I'm stupid, <i>tayyib.</i>

595
01:14:07,786 --> 01:14:09,855
Mama, you're not stupid!
Don't say that.

596
01:14:10,430 --> 01:14:13,002
<i>Tayib,</i> it doesn't sound like
you have anything to do with this.

597
01:14:13,461 --> 01:14:15,864
- Can you turn on your side?
- Yeah, okay.

598
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:23,057
Okay.

599
01:14:28,368 --> 01:14:29,904
Does this hurt?

600
01:14:34,284 --> 01:14:35,429
This might hurt.

601
01:14:37,739 --> 01:14:39,432
The muscles on the side
of your spine

602
01:14:39,523 --> 01:14:41,131
are in spasm...

603
01:14:42,384 --> 01:14:43,968
Where should we take her
to the hospital?

604
01:14:44,049 --> 01:14:44,699
It's okay.

605
01:14:49,914 --> 01:14:51,456
If it's not better
in the morning,

606
01:14:51,491 --> 01:14:53,439
I'll take you to the hospital
for an X-ray.

607
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:54,276
Okay.

608
01:14:57,140 --> 01:14:59,152
Muna, let's get you
out of here.

609
01:15:04,821 --> 01:15:05,704
Nice and slow.

610
01:15:10,316 --> 01:15:11,884
Okay.

611
01:15:14,438 --> 01:15:14,934
<i>Yallah.</i>

612
01:15:15,615 --> 01:15:16,874
- Okay.
- Thank you.

613
01:15:16,875 --> 01:15:17,827
- Yeah.
- Thank you, Matt.

614
01:15:17,862 --> 01:15:18,786
No problem.

615
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:21,901
Matt.

616
01:15:27,381 --> 01:15:28,588
- Good night, Muna.
- Bye!

617
01:15:28,623 --> 01:15:29,284
You feel better.

618
01:15:29,597 --> 01:15:30,409
Thank you.

619
01:15:49,789 --> 01:15:50,813
Easy, easy.

620
01:15:51,115 --> 01:15:52,487
Don't worry,
you'll be okay.

621
01:15:54,298 --> 01:15:56,566
Keep the ice full.
Ten minutes, <i>tayyib?</i>

622
01:15:56,627 --> 01:15:57,602
Okay.

623
01:16:26,989 --> 01:16:29,202
- Good night.
- Good night.

624
01:16:37,899 --> 01:16:40,076
Aunty, do you really work
at White Castle?

625
01:16:44,050 --> 01:16:46,150
Could have at least
chosen Wendy's.

626
01:16:50,818 --> 01:16:52,598
- Night.
- Good night.

627
01:17:03,464 --> 01:17:04,956
Can you take me somewhere?

628
01:17:33,405 --> 01:17:35,510
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, what are you gonna do?

629
01:17:35,570 --> 01:17:36,420
I don't know.

630
01:17:56,542 --> 01:17:57,542
Is Mike here?

631
01:18:01,740 --> 01:18:02,437
Mike.

632
01:18:12,114 --> 01:18:13,788
Why did you hit
my mom?

633
01:18:13,823 --> 01:18:15,225
I don't know
what you're talking about.

634
01:18:16,203 --> 01:18:17,783
What did I ever
do to you?

635
01:18:17,784 --> 01:18:19,690
- Fadi! Fadi!
- My mom can't walk because of you.

636
01:18:20,291 --> 01:18:23,316
My brother could've died
because of you, you stupid...

637
01:18:23,317 --> 01:18:25,267
You're an idiot! You know that?
You're dumb.

638
01:18:25,302 --> 01:18:26,346
What the hell
are you talking about?

639
01:18:26,426 --> 01:18:27,318
Whose a terrorist?

640
01:18:28,330 --> 01:18:29,330
You're the one
who barged in...

641
01:18:31,404 --> 01:18:32,399
Get off him!

642
01:18:33,382 --> 01:18:35,329
- You're an idiot!
- I'm calling cops.

643
01:18:35,330 --> 01:18:36,248
Asshole!

644
01:18:49,191 --> 01:18:49,962
Aunty...

645
01:18:51,257 --> 01:18:52,846
Aunty, Aunty, Aunty,
Aunty, Aunty...

646
01:18:53,314 --> 01:18:55,300
Aunty, Fadi was arrested.

647
01:18:56,994 --> 01:18:58,475
No, no, he's okay.
He went to...

648
01:18:59,854 --> 01:19:00,951
He went to Mike's house.

649
01:19:01,735 --> 01:19:03,822
And, um, they called the cops.
It wasn't his vehicle.

650
01:19:04,925 --> 01:19:06,952
He was the guy
who was at White House earlier.

651
01:19:09,165 --> 01:19:10,237
Look, Aunty, okay...

652
01:19:10,272 --> 01:19:12,320
You can't tell
Mom and Dad, okay?

653
01:19:12,510 --> 01:19:14,544
Cause if they find out I snuck out,
they're gonna kill me.

654
01:19:14,579 --> 01:19:15,787
What do you want
me to do?

655
01:19:20,025 --> 01:19:20,850
Careful, Aunty.

656
01:19:21,578 --> 01:19:23,049
- Allah.
- You okay?

657
01:19:50,546 --> 01:19:51,661
So I've got some news.

658
01:19:53,763 --> 01:19:55,842
They decided to drop
the charges against your son.

659
01:19:56,651 --> 01:19:57,715
Where is he?

660
01:19:57,750 --> 01:19:58,771
We can't
release him yet.

661
01:19:58,806 --> 01:20:00,006
We still need to hold him
for questioning.

662
01:20:00,041 --> 01:20:02,059
- Why?
- It's procedure.

663
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:03,776
Can I see him?

664
01:20:03,998 --> 01:20:05,027
No, not right now.

665
01:20:05,767 --> 01:20:07,164
Well, how long
is he gonna be?

666
01:20:07,646 --> 01:20:08,882
I really couldn't say.

667
01:20:08,971 --> 01:20:10,291
Maybe you can try back again
in the morning.

668
01:20:10,671 --> 01:20:11,614
- In the--
- In the morning?!

669
01:20:11,915 --> 01:20:13,230
I'm sorry.
It's out of my hands.

670
01:20:13,901 --> 01:20:15,218
Ya Allah!

671
01:20:16,768 --> 01:20:18,341
We have to call
your parents.

672
01:20:18,342 --> 01:20:20,066
What? No, no, no.
Okay, listen...

673
01:20:20,439 --> 01:20:21,784
They're not listening
to us, alright?

674
01:20:21,834 --> 01:20:23,746
There's no way that they're
gonna listen to Mom and Dad.

675
01:20:23,747 --> 01:20:26,082
We have to get some help here,
Aunty, okay?

676
01:20:26,482 --> 01:20:28,064
I can't leave my son here.

677
01:20:45,416 --> 01:20:47,701
- I'm sorry if I bothered you.
- No, no.

678
01:20:47,736 --> 01:20:49,323
No, no bother.
Don't worry, we'll--

679
01:20:49,358 --> 01:20:50,676
We'll get this
straightened out.

680
01:20:50,711 --> 01:20:52,369
- You alright?
- Yeah, thank you.

681
01:20:52,370 --> 01:20:52,833
Okay.

682
01:20:58,616 --> 01:20:59,840
Mr. Novatski.

683
01:21:00,361 --> 01:21:01,464
What's going on?

684
01:21:02,310 --> 01:21:05,302
This woman's son was brought in
a few hours ago on assault charges.

685
01:21:05,337 --> 01:21:07,403
Right, and the charges
were dropped.

686
01:21:07,438 --> 01:21:08,493
Not exactly.

687
01:21:08,813 --> 01:21:10,505
Because of the nature
of the complaint,

688
01:21:10,624 --> 01:21:13,051
- we have to investigate further.
- So investigate,

689
01:21:13,101 --> 01:21:15,040
but why my son
have to stay here?

690
01:21:15,054 --> 01:21:16,791
Look, I know
these boys very well.

691
01:21:16,952 --> 01:21:20,476
- I'm sure you do, Mr. Novatski.
- Just they're having a hard time

692
01:21:20,511 --> 01:21:22,572
getting along with each other,
but that's it.

693
01:21:22,713 --> 01:21:25,410
It's nothing that requires
any further investigation.

694
01:21:25,445 --> 01:21:27,239
We're dealing with some
serious accusations, sir.

695
01:21:27,274 --> 01:21:30,263
No, they're not accusations.
They're just-- They're silly rumours

696
01:21:30,298 --> 01:21:32,481
started by kids who have no idea
what they're saying.

697
01:21:32,516 --> 01:21:33,857
We'd love to take
your word for it,

698
01:21:33,858 --> 01:21:36,581
but we take this sort of thing
extremely seriously.

699
01:21:37,499 --> 01:21:39,819
I mean, I don't have to tell you
what's going on in the world.

700
01:21:40,083 --> 01:21:40,907
I understand that,

701
01:21:40,942 --> 01:21:42,467
but you're making
a big mistake here.

702
01:21:42,502 --> 01:21:45,622
This is a 16-year old boy.
I mean, he's harmless.

703
01:21:45,657 --> 01:21:47,941
Like I said, this is
a special circumstance.

704
01:21:47,976 --> 01:21:49,026
Cut the crap!

705
01:21:51,396 --> 01:21:52,832
This is no special circumstance.

706
01:21:52,882 --> 01:21:55,169
This is a boy trying
to defend his mother.

707
01:21:55,852 --> 01:21:57,776
He presents no threat
to anybody.

708
01:21:59,185 --> 01:22:01,041
If I'm--
If I'm wrong,

709
01:22:02,352 --> 01:22:04,520
you... you can hold me
personally responsible.

710
01:22:46,210 --> 01:22:47,274
Salma.

711
01:24:43,336 --> 01:24:44,709
This-- This just sucks.

712
01:25:09,873 --> 01:25:10,780
Sorry, Mom.

713
01:25:31,573 --> 01:25:32,185
Hello.

714
01:26:44,030 --> 01:26:45,333
<i>Welcome to the White Castle.</i>

715
01:26:45,395 --> 01:26:46,860
What are you craving?

716
01:26:59,372 --> 01:27:01,269
Don't look at me.
I don't want any of this.

717
01:27:01,392 --> 01:27:02,556
I just want a cheeseburger.

718
01:27:02,798 --> 01:27:04,094
- Me too!
- I'll have one too, Mom.

719
01:27:04,455 --> 01:27:07,283
- Not before dinner!
- Yeah, Raghda, you are so strict.

720
01:27:11,544 --> 01:27:13,518
They are not.
You will see.

721
01:27:16,025 --> 01:27:17,300
- Hi!
- Hi.

722
01:27:34,816 --> 01:27:35,802
You work today.

723
01:27:36,103 --> 01:27:37,063
Thank you.

724
01:27:38,696 --> 01:27:41,216
Ah, very good!
You are getting better.

725
01:27:42,252 --> 01:27:44,303
- Hello.
- Oh, Mr. Novatski.

726
01:27:44,304 --> 01:27:45,429
Please, call me Stan.

727
01:27:45,509 --> 01:27:47,839
I just, uh... I'm just here
to pick up some food.

728
01:27:47,874 --> 01:27:50,814
Stan, it's too bad
I can't sit with you.

729
01:27:50,815 --> 01:27:53,029
- We are going to eat.
- Oh, well.

730
01:27:53,030 --> 01:27:54,393
- Have a good time.
- Thank you!

731
01:27:55,647 --> 01:27:56,827
Why don't you
come with us?

732
01:27:57,150 --> 01:27:58,967
No, no,
I-- I couldn't.

733
01:27:59,002 --> 01:28:01,491
It's better than the White Castle.
Come on!

734
01:28:02,304 --> 01:28:04,182
Oh, you will like it.
Come on!

735
01:28:04,217 --> 01:28:05,185
It's very kind of you.

736
01:28:05,383 --> 01:28:07,365
I'm just gonna come
and say hello.

737
01:28:07,435 --> 01:28:08,850
- No, it's okay.
- That's fine.

738
01:28:09,825 --> 01:28:11,895
- Hi, I'm Mr. Novatski.
- Hi! Hi.

739
01:28:12,005 --> 01:28:14,035
- Nice to see you.
- Yeah. Nice to see you.

740
01:28:14,070 --> 01:28:16,046
Please come and eat with us.
Arabic food--

741
01:28:16,081 --> 01:28:17,560
- It's the best in the world.
- No, I can't.

742
01:28:17,595 --> 01:28:20,195
- I-- The best in the world.
- <i>Yalla, yalla.</i>

743
01:28:21,323 --> 01:28:23,824
- You sure there's room?
- Yes, yes. Welcome.

744
01:28:24,206 --> 01:28:24,763
All right.

745
01:28:28,269 --> 01:28:30,537
But why are they
all eating cheeseburgers?

746
01:28:39,763 --> 01:28:41,706
Do you like Arabic music?

747
01:28:41,927 --> 01:28:42,712
I like this.

748
01:28:43,091 --> 01:28:44,798
If you like it,
you have a good taste.

749
01:29:05,213 --> 01:29:05,989
Okay.

750
01:29:09,904 --> 01:29:11,798
What happened
to your diet, Aunty?

751
01:29:19,438 --> 01:29:20,774
You gotta stay strong.

752
01:29:54,714 --> 01:29:56,950
- No, no, eat it.
- I will. I will.

753
01:29:58,685 --> 01:29:59,547
How is it?

754
01:30:06,590 --> 01:30:08,302
See... Herbal here.

755
01:30:10,621 --> 01:30:12,891
Um, just inhale.

756
01:30:15,408 --> 01:30:16,903
Yes, yes, yes.

757
01:30:17,730 --> 01:30:19,477
Keep it, keep it, keep it...

758
01:30:19,512 --> 01:30:21,240
Where did it go?

759
01:36:30,089 --> 01:36:35,889
