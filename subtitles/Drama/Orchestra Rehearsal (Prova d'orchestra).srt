1
00:00:18,442 --> 00:00:22,640
ORCHESTRA REHEARSAL

2
00:01:37,554 --> 00:01:40,352
Ooooh! Go on...

3
00:01:41,224 --> 00:01:42,316
...try it out

4
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,325
The acoustics
are marvelous

5
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:47,824
It was an ancient oratory

6
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:52,393
Along there, are the tombs
of3 popes

7
00:01:52,769 --> 00:01:53,895
...and 7 bishops

8
00:01:55,906 --> 00:01:57,498
It's a graveyard in here

9
00:02:00,577 --> 00:02:02,545
In 1871...

10
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,579
...this oratory became
a true auditorium

11
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,616
...for both vocal
and instrumental concerts

12
00:02:10,153 --> 00:02:12,519
All the courts of Europe
envied us for it

13
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,681
For its acoustics

14
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,092
Ooooh, hear it?

15
00:02:19,596 --> 00:02:22,258
The sound is limpid,
without echo

16
00:02:22,633 --> 00:02:24,498
Ideal for listening
to music

17
00:02:25,335 --> 00:02:27,326
Without any reverberation

18
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,670
That podium was...

19
00:02:31,408 --> 00:02:34,206
...for the world's
great conductors...

20
00:02:34,411 --> 00:02:35,639
...a mark of achievement

21
00:02:36,913 --> 00:02:38,073
What musicians!

22
00:02:38,515 --> 00:02:40,540
And the people!

23
00:02:40,917 --> 00:02:44,216
There were ministers,
ambassadors, clergy

24
00:02:44,454 --> 00:02:46,081
They'd bring their
own score...

25
00:02:46,556 --> 00:02:49,047
...to follow the music

26
00:02:50,694 --> 00:02:53,424
And what beautiful
ladies... elegant

27
00:02:53,864 --> 00:02:54,853
...audacious

28
00:02:55,999 --> 00:02:56,966
Playing tricks again?

29
00:02:59,002 --> 00:03:00,401
And the air was perfumed!

30
00:03:01,338 --> 00:03:02,771
...there was another
atmosphere...

31
00:03:03,507 --> 00:03:05,065
The public today is
no longer the same

32
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:07,973
I must be boring you
with this chatter

33
00:03:14,051 --> 00:03:15,245
Everything is in place

34
00:03:17,421 --> 00:03:18,388
Beautiful, eh?

35
00:03:23,727 --> 00:03:26,958
But I'm only the copyist,
second fiddle to everyone

36
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:27,992
Another year...

37
00:03:29,332 --> 00:03:31,061
... and off into retirement

38
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:34,400
I'll return...

39
00:03:34,671 --> 00:03:36,332
...only to attend concerts

40
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:38,337
That yes!

41
00:03:39,476 --> 00:03:40,841
I couldn't live
without music

42
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:10,673
Good morning to one
and all!

43
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:13,601
I heard some TV people
are coming to do...

44
00:04:13,777 --> 00:04:17,042
...a documentary about our
orchestra. This beautiful...

45
00:04:17,247 --> 00:04:20,478
...auditorium was once
a church

46
00:04:20,684 --> 00:04:22,379
...of the 13th century,
as you must know

47
00:04:22,652 --> 00:04:26,418
There, you can see
ancient tombs and...

48
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,387
I already told them

49
00:04:29,359 --> 00:04:30,951
Oh, I'm the first violinist

50
00:04:31,495 --> 00:04:34,623
Good morning, Mirella

51
00:04:36,299 --> 00:04:38,859
Can somebody help with this
cover? It weighs a ton

52
00:04:39,069 --> 00:04:42,800
Here, let me

53
00:04:44,174 --> 00:04:47,200
Don't say anything.
TV people are here

54
00:04:51,314 --> 00:04:53,805
I'd like to know what
they do with these chairs!

55
00:04:54,951 --> 00:04:57,818
Dirty Filthy!

56
00:05:12,235 --> 00:05:12,758
They'll break!

57
00:05:15,405 --> 00:05:15,871
...Break wind!

58
00:05:17,674 --> 00:05:19,437
I'm having a sauna at 4,
no matter what

59
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:23,102
...a snake, a lion... about
thirty positions in all

60
00:05:23,313 --> 00:05:26,510
...but it's all
a mental approach

61
00:05:26,817 --> 00:05:28,148
There's no hurry...

62
00:05:28,852 --> 00:05:30,046
...You're doing wonderfully

63
00:05:31,054 --> 00:05:33,284
To me he looks worse
than the last time

64
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:37,358
Oh, Professor,
with us again!

65
00:05:38,295 --> 00:05:40,286
I'll bet the Professor
here...

66
00:05:40,697 --> 00:05:42,289
...that within 4 months...

67
00:05:42,632 --> 00:05:44,793
Professor, my
Uncle Quintilio...

68
00:05:45,268 --> 00:05:47,566
...ravished them all
for sixty years straight

69
00:05:47,871 --> 00:05:50,567
Big eater. Drinker.
Exceptional stud

70
00:05:51,575 --> 00:05:53,941
Everyone said:
he can't last

71
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:56,476
Well, let me tell you,
he's 93

72
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,646
...and still going strong

73
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:03,918
"One of Werther's sons?"

74
00:06:04,421 --> 00:06:05,581
...begins with G

75
00:06:05,689 --> 00:06:08,157
What rotten people
you run into...

76
00:06:09,192 --> 00:06:11,660
...the light turned green

77
00:06:12,229 --> 00:06:14,197
...but he just stood there

78
00:06:14,898 --> 00:06:17,924
I tapped the horn and said
I was late for a rehearsal

79
00:06:18,368 --> 00:06:21,030
Then, as if eyeing a turd,
he says:

80
00:06:21,338 --> 00:06:23,568
"What's there to rehearse?
It's obvious..."

81
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,332
"...you'll never learn"

82
00:06:29,646 --> 00:06:32,342
You're listening to the
soccer game? Not me...

83
00:06:32,549 --> 00:06:33,846
...I'm too nervous

84
00:06:34,451 --> 00:06:35,748
Your barometer?

85
00:06:36,019 --> 00:06:39,682
Let's see what old
faithful says

86
00:06:39,856 --> 00:06:41,983
Oh, it's gone up
another 15%%%

87
00:06:42,292 --> 00:06:45,386
...the prospects aren't
too good for my violin

88
00:06:45,829 --> 00:06:47,387
How's the octopus?

89
00:06:47,564 --> 00:06:50,226
Ah, it's a battle!
The thing's always there...

90
00:06:50,767 --> 00:06:52,200
...lying in ambush

91
00:06:52,402 --> 00:06:53,300
What a bitch!

92
00:06:53,837 --> 00:06:57,136
Go ahead keep up this shit
about my nightmares

93
00:06:57,974 --> 00:07:00,272
Don't get pissed, Professor,
it's bad for you

94
00:07:00,977 --> 00:07:04,140
Our neurosis is the
that's strangling us

95
00:07:09,019 --> 00:07:11,681
We paid a fortune for him,
but wasn't it worth it?

96
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:14,056
What's that?

97
00:07:14,724 --> 00:07:17,158
A depressant

98
00:07:17,727 --> 00:07:19,285
I've tried them all,
no improvement

99
00:07:20,563 --> 00:07:21,791
...perhaps worse

100
00:07:25,502 --> 00:07:27,834
Why doesn't it play?
- look...

101
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,053
Assholes!

102
00:07:45,288 --> 00:07:48,382
"8 and a Half" is a psycho-
analytical film? Get with it

103
00:07:48,591 --> 00:07:51,219
Brush up! What's with you?

104
00:07:51,528 --> 00:07:53,120
How can I play?
Hey, barometer...

105
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:56,624
...put the chair where it
belongs so I can play

106
00:07:58,068 --> 00:07:59,968
No, sorry...
It's too close to the stand.

107
00:08:00,103 --> 00:08:02,162
I must sit there

108
00:08:02,605 --> 00:08:05,802
I must. Be courteous
I forgot...

109
00:08:05,976 --> 00:08:08,240
...my glasses

110
00:08:08,645 --> 00:08:11,705
I'm not here for courtesies,
but to play!

111
00:08:12,248 --> 00:08:13,715
I, here!

112
00:08:14,317 --> 00:08:15,147
I, there!

113
00:08:15,785 --> 00:08:17,218
This is my place

114
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,520
You're offensive... THERE!

115
00:08:19,756 --> 00:08:20,313
...HERE!

116
00:08:21,024 --> 00:08:23,185
You sick in the head?...
Stop it!

117
00:08:23,393 --> 00:08:24,587
You stop!

118
00:08:42,379 --> 00:08:43,710
...your attention please

119
00:08:45,181 --> 00:08:46,944
A distinguished guest:

120
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:48,446
...Television

121
00:08:49,119 --> 00:08:50,347
With technicians

122
00:08:50,987 --> 00:08:52,887
...and director,
for coverage

123
00:08:53,023 --> 00:08:54,183
...of our orchestra
rehearsal

124
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:57,386
...And interviews

125
00:08:58,061 --> 00:09:00,052
You're better off if we're
not interviewed

126
00:09:00,597 --> 00:09:01,359
otherwise I'll tell

127
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:03,491
Tell what?

128
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,431
That you get a kickback

129
00:09:06,302 --> 00:09:08,566
For your participation

130
00:09:08,705 --> 00:09:10,195
...and your union
representative agrees...

131
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,500
Compensation: nix

132
00:09:12,442 --> 00:09:14,342
No one made any agreement

133
00:09:15,545 --> 00:09:18,776
It's a special job!
For special rates!

134
00:09:19,249 --> 00:09:20,614
It's not special

135
00:09:20,917 --> 00:09:22,282
No, nothing doing!

136
00:09:23,319 --> 00:09:24,786
We're not in agreement

137
00:09:25,422 --> 00:09:27,481
Theoretically, we could
even accept

138
00:09:27,724 --> 00:09:29,351
...but not the Union

139
00:09:30,126 --> 00:09:31,991
It's the usual hedging
with State Television

140
00:09:32,162 --> 00:09:33,356
that's never solved

141
00:09:33,797 --> 00:09:35,731
Let your representative
tell you

142
00:09:36,266 --> 00:09:38,097
Calm down, people...

143
00:09:38,401 --> 00:09:40,631
We're already poorly paid...

144
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:41,996
...but TV wants us
for nothing

145
00:09:42,205 --> 00:09:50,840
The public loves music
and the ones who play it.

146
00:09:51,481 --> 00:09:53,472
...but the minute it
becomes a program...

147
00:09:53,883 --> 00:09:55,817
For filming us, at least
a token

148
00:09:56,052 --> 00:09:56,814
...a gift

149
00:09:57,554 --> 00:09:59,021
No one is obliged

150
00:09:59,222 --> 00:10:01,622
...whoever grants
the interview

151
00:10:01,825 --> 00:10:03,486
...grants it. Who doesn't
want, doesn't grant

152
00:10:03,626 --> 00:10:04,149
How silly! Numbskulls!

153
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,624
Allow me to turn your
attention to something...

154
00:10:06,796 --> 00:10:08,889
What kind of
representative are you?

155
00:10:15,271 --> 00:10:17,535
What an insult! Dumb heads!

156
00:10:21,244 --> 00:10:24,042
I dreamt there was a horse
in my room

157
00:10:24,447 --> 00:10:25,539
That's not good

158
00:10:26,049 --> 00:10:29,143
...Though it depends
on the horse's color

159
00:10:29,352 --> 00:10:30,046
Shitheads!

160
00:10:37,427 --> 00:10:39,019
You want to interview me?

161
00:10:40,463 --> 00:10:42,658
I prepared it

162
00:10:43,266 --> 00:10:44,824
...he helped me with it
through

163
00:10:46,236 --> 00:10:49,000
"The piano is like
a king on a throne"

164
00:10:49,272 --> 00:10:51,502
"Immobile. One must go to it"

165
00:10:51,741 --> 00:10:54,972
"Bow down. Near
the stool to it"

166
00:10:55,612 --> 00:10:58,604
"It's like a mythological
creature"... his doing

167
00:10:59,415 --> 00:11:04,546
"A room with a piano
becomes its room"

168
00:11:05,889 --> 00:11:07,948
"It's an instrument
of royal courts"

169
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:10,589
What was that, Sir?

170
00:11:12,195 --> 00:11:14,755
I said I once played at court

171
00:11:15,131 --> 00:11:17,691
Before Victor Emanuel III

172
00:11:18,001 --> 00:11:19,434
And you weren't shot?

173
00:11:22,705 --> 00:11:26,232
I don't want a piano,
I mean I have one but...

174
00:11:26,442 --> 00:11:28,376
...it needn't be mine

175
00:11:28,711 --> 00:11:31,043
All the pianos of the world
are that piano

176
00:11:31,514 --> 00:11:33,573
To play mine alone...

177
00:11:33,917 --> 00:11:36,010
...would be limiting...
would be restrictive

178
00:11:36,586 --> 00:11:38,076
I think...

179
00:11:38,988 --> 00:11:42,014
...that to realize
one's self, one must...

180
00:11:42,358 --> 00:11:43,154
...be aware

181
00:11:44,594 --> 00:11:46,459
...that is, be more aware
of people

182
00:11:46,663 --> 00:11:49,325
...have more acquaintances

183
00:11:49,699 --> 00:11:52,327
Okay! I'm from
Marina di Pisa

184
00:11:53,069 --> 00:11:54,764
...but I took up the flute
in California

185
00:11:55,505 --> 00:11:57,302
...Where's it's played
sweeter, less violently

186
00:11:57,607 --> 00:12:00,007
The flute is a
delicate instrument

187
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:03,008
The most similar to
the human voice

188
00:12:03,179 --> 00:12:06,637
Even if they say that
about the cello

189
00:12:06,816 --> 00:12:08,579
...and saxophone

190
00:12:08,751 --> 00:12:10,616
...and probably the drum!

191
00:12:12,855 --> 00:12:15,289
It's funny because
choral groups say...

192
00:12:15,425 --> 00:12:18,519
...they sound like an
instrument! But really...

193
00:12:18,695 --> 00:12:20,856
...only the flute has
that human quality

194
00:12:21,431 --> 00:12:24,628
What a mysterious sound...
supernatural!

195
00:12:25,201 --> 00:12:27,726
It even tames wild beasts

196
00:12:27,971 --> 00:12:30,405
Didn't Apollo use the flute
to awaken the dead?

197
00:12:31,341 --> 00:12:35,835
It's the instrument of magic
spells, both solar and lunar

198
00:12:36,045 --> 00:12:38,843
...why flutists are all
so batty

199
00:12:39,415 --> 00:12:42,350
It's true.
That's what they say

200
00:12:42,752 --> 00:12:44,913
Maybe because they blow
and blow...

201
00:12:45,255 --> 00:12:48,884
...and all that wind goes
to their heads, right?

202
00:12:49,659 --> 00:12:52,253
Everyone expects us to...

203
00:12:52,428 --> 00:12:54,521
...do something strange,
who knows why?

204
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:02,433
The trombone is a
unique instrument

205
00:13:03,339 --> 00:13:06,206
...with a grave voice, that
admonishes with kindness

206
00:13:06,643 --> 00:13:10,374
And also very comical,
accompanying clowns

207
00:13:10,546 --> 00:13:12,377
...as they squirt water
and take falls

208
00:13:12,582 --> 00:13:14,243
It's the instrument
of angels!

209
00:13:14,417 --> 00:13:18,183
That's true, in Renaissance
paintings you'll see...

210
00:13:18,354 --> 00:13:19,412
...angels with trombones

211
00:13:19,622 --> 00:13:21,681
Received by the Lord
to trombone music...

212
00:13:21,858 --> 00:13:23,883
...fantastic

213
00:13:24,093 --> 00:13:25,754
The trombone
is the voice...

214
00:13:25,895 --> 00:13:27,362
...of a solitary being

215
00:13:28,064 --> 00:13:30,430
I love to listen to it
along the beach

216
00:13:30,633 --> 00:13:32,726
...in wintertime

217
00:13:56,893 --> 00:14:00,260
I have nothing to say,
really

218
00:14:00,496 --> 00:14:03,465
I was looking at that
hanging cobweb

219
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:06,301
5 or 6 yards long,
isn't it?

220
00:14:06,569 --> 00:14:09,060
With the trombones blowing...

221
00:14:09,205 --> 00:14:11,867
...it swayed back and forth.
Look, look, see it?

222
00:14:12,075 --> 00:14:14,475
...the spider, up there?

223
00:14:14,677 --> 00:14:15,837
...hanging from the thread?

224
00:14:16,145 --> 00:14:18,773
See it?

225
00:14:19,816 --> 00:14:21,579
Isn't it wonderful
that we're here to make...

226
00:14:21,751 --> 00:14:24,117
...a spider go on a swing

227
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,182
Take a look at it

228
00:14:27,523 --> 00:14:29,457
That little spider...

229
00:14:29,592 --> 00:14:31,389
...while the trombones
played...

230
00:14:35,264 --> 00:14:36,925
Can you spare a minute?

231
00:14:37,633 --> 00:14:38,827
...for a frivolous
question?

232
00:14:39,836 --> 00:14:42,066
Is it true there are likes
and dislikes

233
00:14:42,271 --> 00:14:43,829
between instruments?

234
00:14:44,507 --> 00:14:46,270
Absolutely, definite likes
and dislikes

235
00:14:46,442 --> 00:14:50,276
We get along with the bass

236
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,948
...because it keeps time,
tight and even

237
00:14:53,116 --> 00:14:57,280
Without flourishes, trills
or "arpeggios"

238
00:14:57,487 --> 00:14:59,387
The piano is a chatterbox

239
00:14:59,622 --> 00:15:01,817
And violins bleed

240
00:15:01,991 --> 00:15:04,050
In Italy they concentrate
less on rhythm

241
00:15:04,827 --> 00:15:08,285
More on singing. Neapolitans
have a good sense of rhythm

242
00:15:08,498 --> 00:15:10,227
They're the best drummers

243
00:15:10,867 --> 00:15:12,528
Who invented the Tarantella?
The Neapolitans

244
00:15:12,902 --> 00:15:16,599
I'd say the rhythm
instruments...

245
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:17,970
...are liked

246
00:15:18,007 --> 00:15:20,305
...they got humor.
Yeah, they're friendly

247
00:15:20,843 --> 00:15:22,606
What he says is true

248
00:15:22,745 --> 00:15:24,804
That air of sufficiency...

249
00:15:25,348 --> 00:15:26,747
The condescending tone...

250
00:15:27,617 --> 00:15:30,017
The haughtiness... of
a violin, or a flute

251
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,318
...as it takes its place,
just doesn't exist with us

252
00:15:34,257 --> 00:15:35,918
Let a Neapolitan in
an orchestra...

253
00:15:36,092 --> 00:15:38,822
and what's he become?
The tympanist, the drummer

254
00:15:38,995 --> 00:15:41,691
...it makes him feel happy

255
00:15:41,931 --> 00:15:45,594
A little rhythm even helps
the Maestro...

256
00:15:45,768 --> 00:15:48,168
to get unwound.
Even the oboe

257
00:15:48,337 --> 00:15:50,168
forgets that it's gloomy,
and begins smiling

258
00:15:53,643 --> 00:15:56,168
I don't want to be
interviewed, or photographed

259
00:15:56,345 --> 00:15:59,178
I don't want to be mistaken
for someone else

260
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,617
Try asking him

261
00:16:04,086 --> 00:16:04,745
Professor...

262
00:16:05,922 --> 00:16:07,685
Would you mind answering?

263
00:16:07,924 --> 00:16:09,516
Actually, you don't
deserve it

264
00:16:09,859 --> 00:16:12,020
Without compensation, I
shouldn't bother. However...

265
00:16:12,195 --> 00:16:14,129
...go ahead

266
00:16:14,497 --> 00:16:16,897
Let's see... Tell me
about your cello

267
00:16:17,133 --> 00:16:21,035
It's one of the essential
instruments of an orchestra

268
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:23,830
You might say that
the violin and cello...

269
00:16:24,006 --> 00:16:26,474
...are the foundations

270
00:16:26,642 --> 00:16:30,442
...upon which all symphonic
concerts are built

271
00:16:30,613 --> 00:16:32,843
The pillars. Am I wrong?
- Yes...

272
00:16:34,217 --> 00:16:35,343
I'll explain the violin...

273
00:16:36,953 --> 00:16:40,150
The 1st violin is the brain,
the heart of the orchestra

274
00:16:40,423 --> 00:16:42,152
And the clarinet
is the cock!

275
00:16:46,362 --> 00:16:50,696
Look, I'd say the cello
comes close...

276
00:16:50,867 --> 00:16:52,892
...to being the
"ideal friend". It's...

277
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:56,495
...the true friend
...discreet, faithful.

278
00:16:56,873 --> 00:16:58,135
Not like the violin

279
00:16:58,641 --> 00:17:00,734
The violin is seductive,
fascinating

280
00:17:01,511 --> 00:17:02,535
...but deceiving

281
00:17:02,845 --> 00:17:03,504
It's female

282
00:17:04,413 --> 00:17:05,710
Oh, what horseshit!

283
00:17:06,182 --> 00:17:07,843
You don't agree?

284
00:17:08,684 --> 00:17:13,018
No, I don't agree,
because for us the violin...

285
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:16,215
...is the most virile
instrument in the orchestra

286
00:17:16,626 --> 00:17:18,594
It's female!

287
00:17:18,861 --> 00:17:20,453
Isn't "she" always seducing?

288
00:17:20,863 --> 00:17:23,593
Well, if we want
to play games...

289
00:17:23,766 --> 00:17:26,030
...it's totally masculine

290
00:17:26,502 --> 00:17:28,436
...it's penetrating, phallic!

291
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:31,534
I agree with my gentle
colleague

292
00:17:32,275 --> 00:17:34,869
It's not at all feminine,
there's nothing...

293
00:17:35,044 --> 00:17:38,138
...languid about it. It's
vibrant and always modern

294
00:17:38,314 --> 00:17:41,909
In the Conservatories it is
still the preferred...

295
00:17:42,084 --> 00:17:43,676
...instrument

296
00:17:46,022 --> 00:17:48,252
The cello is chronically sad

297
00:17:48,457 --> 00:17:51,051
The violin is the true diva
of the orchestra

298
00:17:51,394 --> 00:17:53,385
I was saying that
the first violin...

299
00:17:53,596 --> 00:17:55,257
...is the star
of the orchestra

300
00:17:56,465 --> 00:18:01,368
When unfortunately we have a
conductor who doesn't keep...

301
00:18:01,537 --> 00:18:02,936
...the tempo, and misses
his cues

302
00:18:03,306 --> 00:18:04,432
...one who lacks authority

303
00:18:05,174 --> 00:18:07,335
...and we can tell
immediately

304
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,205
as soon as he reaches
the podium

305
00:18:09,378 --> 00:18:10,640
...and raises the baton

306
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:15,139
It's the first violin...
...who controls the situation

307
00:18:15,318 --> 00:18:17,411
...and guides the orchestra

308
00:18:17,787 --> 00:18:20,881
...literally substituting...
...the conductor

309
00:18:21,424 --> 00:18:23,483
Whose hand does
the conductor shake

310
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,385
...when the applause comes?

311
00:18:26,596 --> 00:18:28,086
The first violinist's

312
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:30,462
I once told a conductor:

313
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,428
"You're in love with brass"

314
00:18:33,703 --> 00:18:34,635
"That's your speed:
bandmaster!"

315
00:18:36,238 --> 00:18:38,172
How does that fit in?

316
00:18:39,008 --> 00:18:42,205
Getting back to the cello,
it's certainly

317
00:18:42,378 --> 00:18:45,142
...an instrument that will
never betray you

318
00:18:45,514 --> 00:18:49,109
Once it has chosen you
it remains faithful

319
00:18:50,786 --> 00:18:51,252
The bassoon...

320
00:18:52,221 --> 00:18:53,984
good for clowns

321
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:56,158
I owe everything to
the violin.

322
00:18:56,759 --> 00:18:58,920
It helped me take wing
ahead of time

323
00:18:59,629 --> 00:19:00,857
In what sense?

324
00:19:01,931 --> 00:19:04,456
It helped me discover
where dissonances lie

325
00:19:07,303 --> 00:19:10,033
You're interviewing me?
Then I'll go there

326
00:19:10,506 --> 00:19:12,736
That's my place

327
00:19:13,042 --> 00:19:15,875
Comb your hair before the
red light goes on, Curly

328
00:19:16,212 --> 00:19:16,678
Yes, certainly...

329
00:19:18,514 --> 00:19:19,572
The clarinet?

330
00:19:20,082 --> 00:19:23,415
It led me out
of the fog of my hometown.

331
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,648
A village...
...in the Po Valley: Gazoldo

332
00:19:26,689 --> 00:19:30,022
From August to April of
the following year...

333
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:31,621
...it's invisible

334
00:19:31,927 --> 00:19:34,987
The bell tower vanishes,
the school vanishes... and

335
00:19:35,064 --> 00:19:37,589
Let me explain: thanks
to the clarinet...

336
00:19:37,767 --> 00:19:40,827
...I traveled the world.
And even met...

337
00:19:41,003 --> 00:19:43,597
...the great Toscanini,
who told me:

338
00:19:44,073 --> 00:19:46,337
"Bravo, young fellow,
finally..."

339
00:19:46,509 --> 00:19:50,411
"I hear a nice clarinet
sound." His words

340
00:19:51,213 --> 00:19:54,512
"Finally, I hear a nice
clarinet sound!"

341
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,719
And you said?
- What could I say

342
00:19:58,054 --> 00:20:00,113
to a Toscanini
who tells you:

343
00:20:00,256 --> 00:20:03,123
"Bravo, finally I hear
a nice clarinet sound"

344
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:04,883
What did he say?

345
00:20:05,928 --> 00:20:08,453
Didn't you hear?
"Bravo, young fellow..."

346
00:20:08,631 --> 00:20:11,191
"finally I hear a nice
clarinet sound"

347
00:20:11,767 --> 00:20:13,098
Who was playing?

348
00:20:13,369 --> 00:20:13,994
I was!

349
00:20:16,706 --> 00:20:18,640
...a truly fantastic
instrument

350
00:20:19,075 --> 00:20:22,135
...engaging. Not only
for its miraculous

351
00:20:22,311 --> 00:20:24,211
...possibilities.
With a trumpet...

352
00:20:25,014 --> 00:20:27,278
...you can venture into
incredible music acrobatics..

353
00:20:27,616 --> 00:20:28,640
No! What's extraordinary...

354
00:20:29,518 --> 00:20:31,543
...is that it allows you
to express what's inside you

355
00:20:31,754 --> 00:20:35,656
...joy, sadness...
even silence

356
00:20:35,925 --> 00:20:40,828
Claudio, you better talk
to this guy

357
00:20:41,831 --> 00:20:44,595
Pipe down, I'm being
interviewed here!

358
00:20:45,634 --> 00:20:47,534
A mistake... it happens

359
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:50,195
The trumpet is
a passport to...

360
00:20:50,906 --> 00:20:52,237
a greater dimension

361
00:20:53,008 --> 00:20:54,805
Who plays it, understands

362
00:20:55,511 --> 00:20:56,705
A dimension of fullness

363
00:20:57,747 --> 00:20:59,408
Everything is more intense,
more sublime

364
00:21:00,216 --> 00:21:02,684
Ask any trumpet player...
we're quite a few

365
00:21:03,652 --> 00:21:06,917
Tell him how we trumpets
study harder than anyone

366
00:21:07,089 --> 00:21:08,283
What was that?

367
00:21:08,424 --> 00:21:10,915
It's true

368
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:15,028
We spend hours making
our lips supple

369
00:21:15,197 --> 00:21:16,562
...before we begin playing

370
00:21:17,733 --> 00:21:19,894
The margin of error allowed
to other instruments

371
00:21:20,236 --> 00:21:21,760
...isn't tolerated for
the trumpet

372
00:21:22,338 --> 00:21:25,205
Aren't the strings just
as demanding?

373
00:21:25,474 --> 00:21:28,841
A clinker on a trumpet
is death

374
00:21:29,478 --> 00:21:31,275
...it has become a mania...
I can't sleep...

375
00:21:31,647 --> 00:21:34,582
...I'm a sleepwalker...

376
00:21:34,784 --> 00:21:36,843
They found me wandering
outside in pajamas

377
00:21:37,019 --> 00:21:38,919
...playing the trumpet

378
00:21:40,222 --> 00:21:43,089
I'm always terrified
of going sour

379
00:21:43,292 --> 00:21:44,782
You've worked quite a lot...

380
00:21:46,295 --> 00:21:49,059
Hey, "paragraph 9"! You've
had it with me

381
00:21:49,231 --> 00:21:51,461
You can go play
in a jukebox

382
00:21:52,001 --> 00:21:54,299
There's no muzzling in

383
00:21:54,436 --> 00:21:56,802
without getting cleared
through personnel

384
00:21:56,972 --> 00:21:57,563
You understand?

385
00:22:12,288 --> 00:22:14,449
Yes, I'm the Union
Representative

386
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:15,989
for this category
Glad to answer you.

387
00:22:17,593 --> 00:22:19,083
We've freed musicians...

388
00:22:19,295 --> 00:22:20,956
...from a state of
intolerable servility

389
00:22:21,463 --> 00:22:23,294
The music worker today
has reestablished

390
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:25,061
...his dignity

391
00:22:25,467 --> 00:22:27,628
He's not a minstrel,
or the puppet

392
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:29,132
...of conductors and agents

393
00:22:29,672 --> 00:22:32,163
But an integrated worker,
conscious of his contribution

394
00:22:32,341 --> 00:22:33,399
...to mass culture

395
00:22:34,076 --> 00:22:36,544
How did we achieve this?

396
00:22:36,679 --> 00:22:39,512
By safeguarding his prestige
as a professional

397
00:22:39,682 --> 00:22:41,741
...through union struggles

398
00:22:42,284 --> 00:22:46,914
From equitable salary
demands to...

399
00:22:47,089 --> 00:22:48,351
...the elimination
of mediators!

400
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:49,923
Keep quiet!

401
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:52,884
From reconstructing
the organic whole...

402
00:22:53,062 --> 00:22:54,654
of the orchestra

403
00:22:55,264 --> 00:22:57,323
...to the shifting
of progressive objectives...

404
00:23:00,469 --> 00:23:02,596
I thought we agreed... What
will I do with him...

405
00:23:02,671 --> 00:23:03,194
A mouse!

406
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,300
There! Behind the painting

407
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:10,840
It's behind there.
- It's huge!

408
00:23:11,647 --> 00:23:15,105
There it is!

409
00:23:16,352 --> 00:23:17,284
Don't kill it!

410
00:23:24,026 --> 00:23:25,789
They're opening
all the sewers

411
00:23:25,928 --> 00:23:26,860
with their reconstructions

412
00:23:27,796 --> 00:23:29,320
Burn it! You gotta burn it!

413
00:23:32,001 --> 00:23:32,626
Let's fry it

414
00:23:33,702 --> 00:23:34,828
Careful! Catch it

415
00:23:35,371 --> 00:23:38,670
It won't die. It bites

416
00:23:40,476 --> 00:23:42,910
I don't want to see it!

417
00:23:43,946 --> 00:23:46,312
Let's stew it
All right, throw it out.

418
00:23:47,082 --> 00:23:48,913
You're disgusting

419
00:23:48,984 --> 00:23:50,417
Hey! Are we insured
against rats!

420
00:23:50,552 --> 00:23:52,315
To your places!

421
00:23:55,224 --> 00:23:56,782
In place!
The Maestro's here

422
00:24:09,939 --> 00:24:11,372
Our respects, Maestro

423
00:24:17,346 --> 00:24:19,246
How terrible! Please,
no time now

424
00:24:19,415 --> 00:24:23,146
Put out dat light.
Ja, I know...

425
00:24:23,385 --> 00:24:24,818
...you from TV, but
I'm against it

426
00:24:26,488 --> 00:24:27,079
Oboe!...

427
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:29,088
My feet are freezing

428
00:24:31,894 --> 00:24:34,590
I forgot my wool booties
at home

429
00:24:35,264 --> 00:24:37,357
Why you interested
in rehearsals?

430
00:24:37,633 --> 00:24:39,897
This is a workshop.
Or it should be

431
00:24:40,035 --> 00:24:42,367
...where we try to put
something together

432
00:24:42,538 --> 00:24:45,006
What are we doing now?

433
00:24:46,208 --> 00:24:48,005
...trying to construct
something

434
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:50,505
Exactly for what purpose,
I've...

435
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:52,909
...never understood.
You excuse me now

436
00:24:53,882 --> 00:24:55,941
We will talk after

437
00:24:58,253 --> 00:24:59,550
That light, please

438
00:25:03,025 --> 00:25:04,151
The strings, only strings

439
00:25:17,506 --> 00:25:19,838
Violins, what's wrong,
had an argument?

440
00:25:20,209 --> 00:25:22,473
Everyone is playing...

441
00:25:22,644 --> 00:25:24,669
...for himself.
Maybe because

442
00:25:24,813 --> 00:25:25,939
...you belong
to different parties?

443
00:25:26,949 --> 00:25:28,177
Why bother answering him?

444
00:25:28,517 --> 00:25:29,677
Attention...

445
00:25:44,099 --> 00:25:45,498
Stop! Stop!

446
00:25:46,702 --> 00:25:49,102
With finesse! We're not
in Amusement Park

447
00:25:49,238 --> 00:25:52,230
Sentiment, but with elegance.
You're violins

448
00:25:52,408 --> 00:25:53,432
...not trumpets!

449
00:25:55,711 --> 00:25:58,407
Flute, it's an E-flat

450
00:25:58,781 --> 00:25:59,543
...not natural

451
00:26:00,482 --> 00:26:02,074
Here it says E natural

452
00:26:02,751 --> 00:26:03,513
It's an E-flat

453
00:26:04,153 --> 00:26:07,179
It's E natural

454
00:26:07,556 --> 00:26:08,352
Correct it...

455
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:11,783
For you it's always
the copyist's fault!

456
00:26:12,394 --> 00:26:16,956
Clarinet, not... uhaaa!

457
00:26:17,299 --> 00:26:19,631
...more delicate, poetic

458
00:26:19,802 --> 00:26:20,791
Why laughing?

459
00:26:21,503 --> 00:26:22,731
...not comic

460
00:26:23,272 --> 00:26:25,502
Maestro, the whole phrase
is hilarious

461
00:26:25,874 --> 00:26:28,138
Composer's intention
was not hilarity

462
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,777
You laugh uselessly

463
00:26:29,945 --> 00:26:31,742
Listen...

464
00:26:36,285 --> 00:26:37,809
Even he's laughing

465
00:26:39,655 --> 00:26:40,781
It's very funny

466
00:26:41,523 --> 00:26:43,184
You're funnier
than the music

467
00:26:48,297 --> 00:26:49,696
I'm sending you 4 clarinets

468
00:26:50,432 --> 00:26:52,866
Even if you need 1,
you gotta take 4

469
00:27:01,009 --> 00:27:02,408
After, I'll tell you later

470
00:27:19,361 --> 00:27:21,352
Why didn't I stay
in California?

471
00:28:11,146 --> 00:28:12,579
Where are we?

472
00:28:13,882 --> 00:28:15,110
...on a soccer field?

473
00:28:15,784 --> 00:28:17,308
Take me for an umpire?

474
00:28:18,453 --> 00:28:20,318
Too strong! Too penetrating!

475
00:28:20,556 --> 00:28:21,853
Castrate yourselves

476
00:28:22,758 --> 00:28:25,454
He's right... the brass
was too loud

477
00:28:29,064 --> 00:28:30,725
He's a riot!

478
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:36,530
Put the sheets back, go on

479
00:28:38,574 --> 00:28:40,565
I'm also sending a certain
Ciccio Calamida

480
00:28:41,577 --> 00:28:44,102
He plays nothing, but
you gotta take him

481
00:28:44,379 --> 00:28:45,505
because the undersecretary...

482
00:28:45,914 --> 00:28:47,245
Why did he do that?

483
00:28:48,383 --> 00:28:50,112
To give us a little break?

484
00:28:50,953 --> 00:28:52,181
...many thanks

485
00:28:53,288 --> 00:28:54,755
Remember the one who threw
his watch at me?

486
00:28:55,257 --> 00:28:58,852
Tomorrow, though. If it's
400 I'll give you 20%%%

487
00:28:59,494 --> 00:29:02,429
Sunday at the beach
and bring the kid

488
00:29:04,199 --> 00:29:05,860
Let's try the "Gallopade"

489
00:29:06,768 --> 00:29:07,632
...from no. 15

490
00:29:29,658 --> 00:29:32,126
Alt! You got fear of strings?

491
00:29:32,294 --> 00:29:34,421
Or low blood pressure?
Da capo!

492
00:29:59,021 --> 00:30:01,182
Alt! Oboe, too invading!

493
00:30:02,758 --> 00:30:05,022
...give room to the others.
Da capo!

494
00:30:30,152 --> 00:30:32,347
You tickle the strings

495
00:30:32,554 --> 00:30:35,421
...you must slice! Saw!

496
00:30:35,857 --> 00:30:37,381
May I ask a question?

497
00:30:37,893 --> 00:30:39,884
Do you know what you're
here for?

498
00:30:40,062 --> 00:30:44,021
I want compact sound.
Da capo!

499
00:31:09,624 --> 00:31:11,182
That's it! Like that

500
00:31:11,793 --> 00:31:12,623
Go on!

501
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,621
I don't hear! More life

502
00:31:46,962 --> 00:31:48,054
Let me hear the bass!

503
00:31:50,532 --> 00:31:52,363
Don't fall behind!
Weiter!

504
00:32:18,393 --> 00:32:20,486
Genauso! Break through!

505
00:32:20,796 --> 00:32:21,763
...ACHTUNG!

506
00:33:02,804 --> 00:33:05,932
Toscanini clarinet,
please be so kind...

507
00:33:06,107 --> 00:33:08,473
...to repeat alone
last four bars

508
00:33:08,643 --> 00:33:09,837
...from no. 82

509
00:33:11,179 --> 00:33:14,842
No, I played it once then
twice. The third time...

510
00:33:15,016 --> 00:33:16,950
...by myself is against
union regulations

511
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:20,716
The passage must be executed
by the entire orchestra

512
00:33:21,022 --> 00:33:23,115
What's he running,
a school?

513
00:33:23,425 --> 00:33:27,122
I'd think less about unions
and more...

514
00:33:27,295 --> 00:33:28,785
...about music

515
00:33:31,466 --> 00:33:33,263
And yet I insist

516
00:33:33,435 --> 00:33:36,871
If Wagner had to worry about

517
00:33:37,038 --> 00:33:38,164
...unions and strikes

518
00:33:38,807 --> 00:33:40,365
...nix music and operas

519
00:33:40,742 --> 00:33:44,007
It's not the union's fault
if he wrote lousy music

520
00:33:44,513 --> 00:33:45,980
Ja... there's no peace

521
00:33:46,615 --> 00:33:47,877
...no calm, no silence

522
00:33:49,384 --> 00:33:50,715
It's a shit life

523
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,647
Smear that shit on
your baton and then

524
00:33:53,822 --> 00:33:54,516
...give it a lick

525
00:33:58,326 --> 00:33:59,623
From 5-3-0

526
00:34:00,061 --> 00:34:00,959
The saxhorn, please

527
00:34:03,365 --> 00:34:04,059
What was that?

528
00:34:04,266 --> 00:34:04,630
Saxhorn?

529
00:34:06,334 --> 00:34:09,633
Not here

530
00:34:09,938 --> 00:34:10,996
Meaning what?

531
00:34:11,806 --> 00:34:13,296
I don't know. He's not here

532
00:34:13,475 --> 00:34:17,809
He "couldn't" come,
why is that?

533
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:20,070
You asking me?

534
00:34:20,315 --> 00:34:22,681
I'll restate it

535
00:34:22,817 --> 00:34:24,842
Not he "couldn't", but
he "wouldn't" come...

536
00:34:25,086 --> 00:34:26,110
...in protest

537
00:34:26,855 --> 00:34:28,755
With the Union's approval

538
00:34:28,924 --> 00:34:30,789
So who plays,
somebody's sister?

539
00:34:31,493 --> 00:34:34,155
Leave our sisters alone

540
00:34:34,396 --> 00:34:35,886
...let's keep
the families out

541
00:34:36,197 --> 00:34:38,631
You said,
"somebody's sister"

542
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:39,696
I only meant a...

543
00:34:40,802 --> 00:34:43,236
...hypothetical
saxhorn sister

544
00:34:43,505 --> 00:34:45,029
I don't grasp such subtle
humor

545
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,409
You just worry about
your baton

546
00:34:48,643 --> 00:34:50,941
...and we'll take care
of our relatives

547
00:34:56,751 --> 00:34:58,309
All right then, from 5-2-0

548
00:34:58,753 --> 00:35:01,779
Not now

549
00:35:02,223 --> 00:35:03,622
The orchestra is upset

550
00:35:04,459 --> 00:35:06,393
...I doubt they can
continue rehearsing

551
00:35:09,664 --> 00:35:12,462
What the devil do you want
from me?

552
00:35:12,968 --> 00:35:15,596
See me lose my mind,
you want?

553
00:35:15,837 --> 00:35:17,361
You want my ass?

554
00:35:17,906 --> 00:35:19,464
Here, you got it!

555
00:35:24,579 --> 00:35:26,740
The orchestra will take
a double break

556
00:35:27,048 --> 00:35:27,776
...20 minutes

557
00:35:54,776 --> 00:35:57,040
The conductor? He's not
too bad

558
00:35:57,445 --> 00:35:58,639
Bit hysterical, but
within reason

559
00:35:58,847 --> 00:36:00,906
There's no need for
conductors like that

560
00:36:01,082 --> 00:36:03,380
A metronome's better

561
00:36:05,387 --> 00:36:07,821
The public should sit
in with us

562
00:36:07,989 --> 00:36:10,014
They'd hear the orchestra
as if watching a...

563
00:36:10,191 --> 00:36:12,489
...battle in a movie

564
00:36:12,861 --> 00:36:14,624
...or watching a real battle

565
00:36:15,363 --> 00:36:17,558
Ascetic. Tormented.
Authoritative

566
00:36:18,433 --> 00:36:21,596
Magnetic... the identity
of a great conductor!

567
00:36:21,836 --> 00:36:23,633
Then there are the mystics,
the priest-like

568
00:36:23,805 --> 00:36:24,794
The acrobatic

569
00:36:25,573 --> 00:36:27,905
How 'bout that lion tamer?

570
00:36:28,176 --> 00:36:31,339
He'd turn into a harp,
a violin, the drum

571
00:36:31,713 --> 00:36:34,181
...a kettledrum, even
the bassoon, what a riot!

572
00:36:34,382 --> 00:36:35,849
When there's a TV camera...

573
00:36:36,184 --> 00:36:37,412
... you can't shut up

574
00:36:38,319 --> 00:36:40,446
My Maestro up there
has to look at me

575
00:36:40,622 --> 00:36:42,146
...otherwise I'm jealous

576
00:36:47,395 --> 00:36:49,329
I'm on camera?

577
00:36:49,464 --> 00:36:51,830
"We're the lilies
of the valley"

578
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,195
"We're pure Romans"

579
00:36:54,703 --> 00:36:56,967
...who's got friends?
Who sees anybody?

580
00:36:57,872 --> 00:37:00,204
You come in, punch a card

581
00:37:00,442 --> 00:37:01,739
...and pick it up later

582
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:02,535
It's a factory

583
00:37:03,545 --> 00:37:04,011
Me?

584
00:37:05,013 --> 00:37:07,106
I thought I'd tour
the world with this

585
00:37:07,982 --> 00:37:08,971
...but I'm always here

586
00:37:10,418 --> 00:37:11,851
I'm sick of it...

587
00:37:12,387 --> 00:37:13,911
...this ridiculous
fart horn...

588
00:37:14,956 --> 00:37:17,220
It makes me feel useless,
it should be eliminated

589
00:37:17,992 --> 00:37:19,357
What's it good for?

590
00:37:19,961 --> 00:37:21,792
It can even be dangerous

591
00:37:21,963 --> 00:37:24,557
I give my all to shape
a sound

592
00:37:24,733 --> 00:37:27,793
...and out comes
another fart

593
00:37:29,404 --> 00:37:30,871
I think...

594
00:37:31,473 --> 00:37:33,998
...it's the very symbol
of obtuseness

595
00:37:34,242 --> 00:37:35,971
...of a stolid mentality

596
00:37:36,111 --> 00:37:38,477
Of those relationships...

597
00:37:39,114 --> 00:37:40,741
...in an orchestra,
that inhibit

598
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:43,342
...any sort of contact

599
00:37:46,221 --> 00:37:48,189
I wanted to say that many
of us are from the provinces

600
00:37:48,623 --> 00:37:49,555
What province?...

601
00:37:50,492 --> 00:37:52,255
I'm from Naples:
"vaffanculo"

602
00:37:53,561 --> 00:37:55,290
The actual truth though

603
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:57,193
...is that we're limited

604
00:37:57,999 --> 00:37:59,193
...culturally

605
00:38:00,068 --> 00:38:02,468
We've no real interests
in anything

606
00:38:02,604 --> 00:38:05,300
We spend our lives with
a piece of wood or tin

607
00:38:05,473 --> 00:38:07,839
...blowing away, or plucking

608
00:38:08,009 --> 00:38:10,807
Blow your philosophy
someplace else

609
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,176
Anyway...

610
00:38:14,015 --> 00:38:15,141
All your gabbing about

611
00:38:16,151 --> 00:38:18,949
...Unions, the organic whole,
politics

612
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,083
...brass section, strings

613
00:38:21,222 --> 00:38:23,213
...this or that conductor

614
00:38:23,391 --> 00:38:25,052
...couldn't interest me less

615
00:38:25,727 --> 00:38:29,390
Because I can't get it up
anymore

616
00:38:30,398 --> 00:38:31,228
That's the real tragedy

617
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:48,408
Drink, drink, it's great
for the liver and the brain

618
00:38:49,584 --> 00:38:50,573
Just a drop of wine...

619
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:52,518
...picks me up

620
00:38:52,854 --> 00:38:54,515
A little drop can't hurt

621
00:38:54,889 --> 00:38:58,825
It's whiskey, I saw it

622
00:38:59,027 --> 00:39:01,689
...and I even smell it

623
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:06,328
Each to his own vices.
Better to drink...

624
00:39:06,534 --> 00:39:07,899
...than go molesting
little girls

625
00:39:08,837 --> 00:39:12,295
They'll catch you one day.
That's worse...

626
00:39:12,473 --> 00:39:12,962
...than whiskey

627
00:39:15,076 --> 00:39:16,839
I didn't choose the tuba

628
00:39:17,545 --> 00:39:18,842
...it chose me

629
00:39:19,981 --> 00:39:23,075
I loved the trumpet.
It gave me goose pimples

630
00:39:23,484 --> 00:39:25,179
You remember in the army...

631
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,751
...when they played taps

632
00:39:36,531 --> 00:39:38,328
I'd get a lump in my throat

633
00:39:38,566 --> 00:39:40,659
...and then go AWOL.

634
00:39:40,902 --> 00:39:42,062
I'm very sensitive

635
00:39:42,637 --> 00:39:43,865
All art makes me cry

636
00:39:45,306 --> 00:39:46,330
And that's not all...

637
00:39:47,709 --> 00:39:49,267
At times I could die

638
00:39:49,811 --> 00:39:50,641
Why?

639
00:39:50,812 --> 00:39:54,077
The world is evil

640
00:39:54,983 --> 00:39:56,245
Now I miss my father!

641
00:39:57,051 --> 00:39:58,416
What the fuck you saying?

642
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:01,011
Let's talk about
the instrument

643
00:40:01,422 --> 00:40:03,447
The fact that everybody
refused it, moved me

644
00:40:04,292 --> 00:40:06,123
Poor tuba... like a stray dog

645
00:40:06,494 --> 00:40:09,793
I felt akin to it

646
00:40:10,498 --> 00:40:11,465
...sad, and solitary...

647
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,897
It's awkward like me

648
00:40:14,068 --> 00:40:16,696
We had to get together

649
00:40:17,272 --> 00:40:20,298
And we did. I did well,
it was destiny!

650
00:40:21,376 --> 00:40:22,673
...I'm attached to it

651
00:40:23,745 --> 00:40:24,734
...we're true friends

652
00:40:27,515 --> 00:40:29,983
When things are down
we go by the window

653
00:40:30,218 --> 00:40:32,152
...look up at the moon

654
00:40:33,421 --> 00:40:35,321
...and play a little solo
from Verdi

655
00:40:35,657 --> 00:40:37,887
Like to hear it? Eh?

656
00:40:38,993 --> 00:40:40,392
A little piece, why not

657
00:41:03,184 --> 00:41:05,744
People react and interpret
sounds, each in their own way

658
00:41:06,454 --> 00:41:07,785
It's a personal thing

659
00:41:08,156 --> 00:41:11,523
An F-sharp, or a B-flat

660
00:41:11,693 --> 00:41:13,320
...can make some
people swoon

661
00:41:14,362 --> 00:41:16,455
...and others vomit. That's
the way the ball bounces

662
00:41:17,131 --> 00:41:19,031
Yes, true

663
00:41:19,534 --> 00:41:21,502
What a magnificent
instrument the oboe is

664
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:23,701
It's the oldest of all

665
00:41:24,472 --> 00:41:25,939
...invented by the Chinese

666
00:41:27,375 --> 00:41:28,307
The most difficult

667
00:41:29,277 --> 00:41:30,039
The most delicate

668
00:41:31,512 --> 00:41:32,444
...and most alone

669
00:41:33,247 --> 00:41:34,680
We oboists are isolated

670
00:41:35,249 --> 00:41:37,376
Envied, even disliked

671
00:41:39,087 --> 00:41:42,523
The orchestra has to reckon
with the oboe

672
00:41:43,725 --> 00:41:45,886
The oboe sets down the laws

673
00:41:46,127 --> 00:41:49,221
The oboe established
the diapason

674
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:50,963
...between the highest pitch

675
00:41:51,733 --> 00:41:53,394
...and the lowest

676
00:41:54,335 --> 00:41:56,132
It's owing to this privilege

677
00:41:56,537 --> 00:41:58,164
...that the violin hates
the oboe

678
00:41:58,873 --> 00:42:02,741
...and the oboe the violin

679
00:42:03,444 --> 00:42:05,469
It's an instrument

680
00:42:08,616 --> 00:42:11,312
...of great spirituality

681
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:14,617
He who plays it,
develops...

682
00:42:15,723 --> 00:42:17,418
...a sort of special power

683
00:42:19,994 --> 00:42:21,894
An interior vision

684
00:42:22,363 --> 00:42:23,625
...which permits him

685
00:42:24,365 --> 00:42:26,265
...to perceive the color
of sound

686
00:42:27,568 --> 00:42:28,330
I play...

687
00:42:29,437 --> 00:42:30,096
...and see

688
00:42:31,305 --> 00:42:33,000
...an aura of gold

689
00:42:33,608 --> 00:42:34,905
...luminous

690
00:42:35,143 --> 00:42:36,508
...the color of sunlight...

691
00:42:38,546 --> 00:42:40,639
like a spreading reflection
It's true...

692
00:42:41,182 --> 00:42:43,412
I once saw a thing...

693
00:42:43,684 --> 00:42:45,515
...like a long streamer

694
00:42:47,121 --> 00:42:49,783
A supernatural experience!

695
00:42:50,525 --> 00:42:53,016
Let him hear.
You care to hear?

696
00:42:53,227 --> 00:42:55,718
Certainly, if you're
not bored

697
00:43:05,907 --> 00:43:06,999
Maestro?... Excuse me

698
00:43:10,478 --> 00:43:11,445
Another minute...

699
00:43:12,213 --> 00:43:13,202
...he's taking a shower

700
00:43:15,616 --> 00:43:18,346
With the permanent conductor
they once had...

701
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:21,011
...the musicians didn't
carry on like this

702
00:43:22,623 --> 00:43:24,113
Everyone wore a tie!

703
00:43:24,759 --> 00:43:26,852
You were in trouble
if you didn't

704
00:43:28,162 --> 00:43:31,825
Now I wouldn't be surprised
if they soaked their feet...

705
00:43:31,999 --> 00:43:34,058
...while playing.
We had a strict rule

706
00:43:34,235 --> 00:43:37,398
Whoever went flat
or missed his cue

707
00:43:37,972 --> 00:43:40,031
...had to play standing

708
00:43:40,475 --> 00:43:42,636
For the length of
the entire concert

709
00:43:43,044 --> 00:43:44,136
...as punishment

710
00:43:45,613 --> 00:43:48,548
What? Sessions? Hour shifts?

711
00:43:48,716 --> 00:43:50,149
...you worked all night

712
00:43:51,185 --> 00:43:53,483
Ah, how often I had to wait
till dawn

713
00:43:54,455 --> 00:43:56,855
And the musicians, at dawn,
dead tired...

714
00:43:57,825 --> 00:43:59,156
...would applaud
the conductor

715
00:43:59,827 --> 00:44:00,953
...and thank him

716
00:44:02,396 --> 00:44:03,886
Oh, he was phenomenal

717
00:44:04,999 --> 00:44:07,729
...he conducted with eyes
closed, as if in a trance

718
00:44:08,035 --> 00:44:10,196
...and yet saw everything.
How?...

719
00:44:13,541 --> 00:44:16,704
When he had to give a player
a calling down

720
00:44:17,378 --> 00:44:20,779
...he could find words
that would skin him alive

721
00:44:21,582 --> 00:44:23,550
And make him ill for a month

722
00:44:25,019 --> 00:44:27,510
And with his baton?
Such lashings...

723
00:44:27,688 --> 00:44:29,121
...on the hands and fingers
of those players

724
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:30,814
who made a mistake

725
00:44:31,459 --> 00:44:33,427
It would hiss!

726
00:44:34,061 --> 00:44:37,428
Yet, you know something?
They were happy

727
00:44:38,166 --> 00:44:40,691
...for those hand raps

728
00:44:42,069 --> 00:44:44,128
They'd come up like
school children

729
00:44:45,106 --> 00:44:46,835
...hands held out and say:

730
00:44:47,275 --> 00:44:49,038
"My fault"

731
00:44:49,377 --> 00:44:51,436
"Hit me too... Me too,
I was wrong"

732
00:44:51,979 --> 00:44:53,844
Those were the days!

733
00:44:55,683 --> 00:44:57,548
You see what he's doing?

734
00:44:58,252 --> 00:44:59,913
TAKE YOUR STICK AND
CONDUCT MY PRICK

735
00:45:01,756 --> 00:45:02,723
You think that's right?

736
00:45:03,391 --> 00:45:04,858
Maybe now it's right

737
00:45:05,826 --> 00:45:06,952
No one knows anymore

738
00:45:15,436 --> 00:45:16,425
Maestro, there are...

739
00:45:17,305 --> 00:45:18,670
What else you want to know?

740
00:45:19,941 --> 00:45:22,466
I ask you: does music exist?
No?

741
00:45:22,910 --> 00:45:25,936
Then the world doesn't exist.
Only our habits do

742
00:45:26,113 --> 00:45:27,239
You may go...

743
00:45:30,218 --> 00:45:32,015
What meaning
has music today?

744
00:45:33,387 --> 00:45:36,322
You think people know
what music is?

745
00:45:37,491 --> 00:45:39,982
They consider themselves
intelligent because they feel

746
00:45:40,161 --> 00:45:42,755
...emotion in the gut.
They're participating

747
00:45:43,364 --> 00:45:46,197
Beethoven makes them feel
like knights in armor

748
00:45:48,336 --> 00:45:50,770
Some seem to be jumping out
of their seats

749
00:45:55,576 --> 00:45:57,567
When I'm conducting, I'm
always feeling ridiculous

750
00:45:59,947 --> 00:46:01,881
As if dead. I feel
like a ghost

751
00:46:02,583 --> 00:46:05,279
Better I don't say these
things. Cancel it!

752
00:46:06,187 --> 00:46:08,246
Today nothing is forgiven.
One must be...

753
00:46:08,556 --> 00:46:10,183
...always intelligent

754
00:46:11,225 --> 00:46:14,991
So let us say: music is...
...the world

755
00:46:15,463 --> 00:46:18,261
When I conduct I own
the world.

756
00:46:18,399 --> 00:46:19,627
I am a king

757
00:46:20,601 --> 00:46:23,161
You want to know really
how I feel?

758
00:46:24,372 --> 00:46:27,830
Like a sergeant who
must go kicking...

759
00:46:28,009 --> 00:46:28,634
...everybody in the ass

760
00:46:29,844 --> 00:46:31,971
But absurd laws forbid me...

761
00:46:32,146 --> 00:46:33,374
...to be a sergeant

762
00:46:35,349 --> 00:46:37,044
Certainly we have taken
advantage of

763
00:46:37,218 --> 00:46:38,515
our privileged positions

764
00:46:38,753 --> 00:46:39,720
Excuse me...

765
00:46:41,555 --> 00:46:42,681
Ach, warm as usual

766
00:46:43,224 --> 00:46:44,452
...no ice

767
00:46:46,794 --> 00:46:49,490
Talent is the child of whims
and eccentricity

768
00:46:51,799 --> 00:46:54,597
I once asked a musician
to remove his ring

769
00:46:54,769 --> 00:46:57,431
...the twinkling of the stone
bothered me

770
00:46:58,773 --> 00:47:02,038
And this seemed a caprice,
the whim of a divo

771
00:47:02,443 --> 00:47:03,410
That may even be

772
00:47:04,745 --> 00:47:07,339
But an exuberant character
for an artist

773
00:47:07,548 --> 00:47:10,073
...is a vital charge

774
00:47:10,251 --> 00:47:12,082
...for leading others,
for interpreting symphonies

775
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:13,443
Prosit

776
00:47:17,992 --> 00:47:20,085
But now this unique charge
of the conductor

777
00:47:20,261 --> 00:47:21,023
is being contested

778
00:47:22,396 --> 00:47:23,192
The musicians?...

779
00:47:24,498 --> 00:47:26,125
...don't look at them,
don't see them

780
00:47:27,535 --> 00:47:29,901
Sometimes they have
unbearable face

781
00:47:32,139 --> 00:47:33,163
I'd put...

782
00:47:33,374 --> 00:47:35,842
...a screen in front
of some of them

783
00:47:37,011 --> 00:47:38,137
They're like wild dogs

784
00:47:39,213 --> 00:47:40,737
With wild eyes... No!

785
00:47:41,582 --> 00:47:42,606
Better cancel that too

786
00:47:44,118 --> 00:47:45,107
...or they shoot my legs

787
00:47:47,421 --> 00:47:49,412
The time of greatness
is "Kaputt"

788
00:47:52,493 --> 00:47:55,553
I remember the first time
I took my place at the podium

789
00:47:56,130 --> 00:47:58,724
My first, great impression
was...

790
00:47:58,966 --> 00:48:01,400
...the enormous silence
that fell before me

791
00:48:03,604 --> 00:48:04,969
As I signaled to begin...

792
00:48:05,973 --> 00:48:07,338
...I suddenly realized,
with great emotion,

793
00:48:07,742 --> 00:48:09,175
that my conductor's baton

794
00:48:10,077 --> 00:48:11,908
...was tied to the sound
of the orchestra

795
00:48:12,747 --> 00:48:14,214
Its voice came from within
my hand

796
00:48:15,516 --> 00:48:17,746
It would pull the orchestra
out of silence

797
00:48:18,152 --> 00:48:20,211
...and to silence make
it return

798
00:48:21,922 --> 00:48:24,322
This voice would rise...

799
00:48:24,492 --> 00:48:26,892
...like a sea wave
together with my arm

800
00:48:27,027 --> 00:48:29,757
...moving through the air
like a bird's wing

801
00:48:31,132 --> 00:48:34,499
And when my arm lowered,
this harmonic voice...

802
00:48:35,336 --> 00:48:36,428
...would fade again into
silence

803
00:48:39,039 --> 00:48:41,633
But now everyone is equal,
and I should resemble...

804
00:48:41,842 --> 00:48:43,969
...the first violinist
with his butcher's hands

805
00:48:45,379 --> 00:48:47,142
So I have fits of rage

806
00:48:48,182 --> 00:48:48,978
And buy houses

807
00:48:53,187 --> 00:48:53,915
Two in America

808
00:48:55,356 --> 00:48:57,347
One in Tokyo, in London,
and Berlin...

809
00:48:58,826 --> 00:49:01,124
In Paris, no houses.
That's because...

810
00:49:01,295 --> 00:49:04,355
I do not go along with
the music of France

811
00:49:05,266 --> 00:49:07,757
That's why, maybe,
the Customs at Orly...

812
00:49:08,302 --> 00:49:10,031
...is always frisking me

813
00:49:10,204 --> 00:49:12,468
...from head to foot

814
00:49:15,476 --> 00:49:17,535
You have your interview?
That's enough

815
00:49:19,647 --> 00:49:23,606
You say "the conductor"
but this word...

816
00:49:23,984 --> 00:49:24,814
...has no meaning anymore

817
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:28,154
A true conductor is like
a priest

818
00:49:29,423 --> 00:49:30,947
He must have a church...
with believers

819
00:49:31,459 --> 00:49:35,486
...but when the faithful
all become

820
00:49:35,663 --> 00:49:36,561
...atheists...

821
00:49:37,898 --> 00:49:40,867
I remember Koplensky
my great maestro

822
00:49:41,836 --> 00:49:43,599
...I was first violinist

823
00:49:44,371 --> 00:49:46,498
When he took the podium,
everything was silence

824
00:49:47,274 --> 00:49:48,673
He would only look around...

825
00:49:49,376 --> 00:49:52,345
...distractedly.
But he already knew

826
00:49:52,513 --> 00:49:54,743
...every line of the score
in front of him

827
00:49:56,350 --> 00:49:58,011
He was music personified

828
00:49:59,019 --> 00:50:03,649
And we followed him happily,
with absolute reverence

829
00:50:03,824 --> 00:50:05,291
To enact the rite
of transubstantiation

830
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:07,622
...to change the wine
into blood...

831
00:50:08,696 --> 00:50:09,628
...the bread into flesh...

832
00:50:10,764 --> 00:50:11,628
You laugh?

833
00:50:12,633 --> 00:50:13,361
...I hope not

834
00:50:14,969 --> 00:50:15,958
Music is always sacred

835
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:18,665
Every concert is a Mass

836
00:50:20,908 --> 00:50:22,569
We were enthralled,
and we...

837
00:50:24,378 --> 00:50:26,403
...would forget
all worries...

838
00:50:26,647 --> 00:50:29,309
...at the first sign
of his baton

839
00:50:29,517 --> 00:50:32,350
...We were but one breath,
we and our instruments

840
00:50:32,653 --> 00:50:34,644
...a single vital force

841
00:50:35,956 --> 00:50:37,253
He would begin!

842
00:50:39,026 --> 00:50:40,618
Nothing was more beautiful
than his authority

843
00:50:42,796 --> 00:50:43,888
We trembled...

844
00:50:45,132 --> 00:50:45,860
...at the thought

845
00:50:47,434 --> 00:50:49,959
...of a mistake
in performing this rite

846
00:50:51,539 --> 00:50:53,029
An overwhelming emotion

847
00:50:53,874 --> 00:50:55,432
...an immense happiness

848
00:50:56,310 --> 00:50:58,369
We could feel...

849
00:50:58,646 --> 00:51:01,615
...our joy transmitting
itself

850
00:51:02,082 --> 00:51:05,051
...to the audience, which was
immobile, holding its breath

851
00:51:05,753 --> 00:51:08,415
We didn't watch the conductor
it wasn't necessary

852
00:51:09,356 --> 00:51:11,153
He was there, and we knew it

853
00:51:11,559 --> 00:51:12,890
...we felt it

854
00:51:16,997 --> 00:51:19,022
He was... within us

855
00:51:20,801 --> 00:51:22,701
...so much love passed
between him and us

856
00:51:24,738 --> 00:51:26,296
A love which you can see...

857
00:51:27,141 --> 00:51:28,165
...is now lost

858
00:51:30,844 --> 00:51:33,836
I and my musicians only feel
diffidence for each other

859
00:51:34,949 --> 00:51:36,644
The doubting...

860
00:51:36,884 --> 00:51:37,976
...which destroys belief

861
00:51:38,953 --> 00:51:41,547
And then there's a lack
of respect

862
00:51:41,689 --> 00:51:43,816
There's resentment. Because
something has been lost

863
00:51:43,991 --> 00:51:45,583
...never to be found

864
00:51:49,229 --> 00:51:50,423
That's how we play together

865
00:51:52,566 --> 00:51:55,091
United by a mutual hatred

866
00:51:57,204 --> 00:51:58,671
...like a family in ruin

867
00:52:24,031 --> 00:52:26,591
Maestro, the lights have
gone out

868
00:52:26,967 --> 00:52:27,592
I know

869
00:52:28,435 --> 00:52:29,197
What now?

870
00:52:30,404 --> 00:52:32,235
The break is over,
we rehearse!

871
00:52:38,078 --> 00:52:41,104
Go ahead, walk.
Light my way

872
00:52:51,959 --> 00:52:53,085
"Conductor, conductor..."

873
00:52:53,694 --> 00:52:54,888
"Conductor, no more!"

874
00:52:56,063 --> 00:52:57,894
"You'll only conduct us
Bowed to the floor"

875
00:53:22,156 --> 00:53:24,647
Claudio... you gotta
do something

876
00:53:30,698 --> 00:53:31,596
Now, the other eye!

877
00:53:32,099 --> 00:53:33,623
Boys, what are you doing?

878
00:53:35,169 --> 00:53:36,261
...listen

879
00:53:36,837 --> 00:53:38,498
"Conductor, conductor...
Conductor, no more"

880
00:53:39,173 --> 00:53:41,607
"You'll only conduct us
Bowed to the floor"

881
00:53:56,990 --> 00:53:59,618
Conductor no more!
No conducting allowed!

882
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:04,688
We were idiots...

883
00:54:05,332 --> 00:54:06,390
...to study

884
00:54:07,568 --> 00:54:08,762
...to spend a lifetime
in a Conservatory

885
00:54:09,336 --> 00:54:10,360
That's right!

886
00:54:11,638 --> 00:54:13,697
We don't need conductors,
don't need music

887
00:54:14,108 --> 00:54:16,736
Nothing. Just a ring...

888
00:54:16,977 --> 00:54:18,274
...in our nose like savages

889
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:22,074
Music is a public service.
It belongs to everyone

890
00:54:22,249 --> 00:54:23,841
Without class distinction

891
00:54:26,019 --> 00:54:27,213
Maestro...

892
00:54:27,955 --> 00:54:28,922
...how did this happen?

893
00:54:29,723 --> 00:54:31,281
"Conductor, conductor..."

894
00:54:31,925 --> 00:54:33,222
"Conductor no more"

895
00:54:34,294 --> 00:54:36,489
"You'll only conduct us
Bowed to the floor"

896
00:54:48,342 --> 00:54:50,276
What are you doing?

897
00:54:51,612 --> 00:54:52,601
You're crazy!

898
00:54:55,015 --> 00:54:55,481
How nice...

899
00:54:56,750 --> 00:54:57,546
...you're all sweated...

900
00:55:03,991 --> 00:55:05,686
"Conductor, Conductor..."

901
00:55:06,994 --> 00:55:08,120
What's falling here?

902
00:55:09,196 --> 00:55:12,188
What's happening?
- Worse yet, you're shifty,

903
00:55:12,232 --> 00:55:13,290
and corrupt. You've
been bought

904
00:55:13,333 --> 00:55:14,925
You signed too

905
00:55:15,169 --> 00:55:17,797
I'm reporting you the
Association. Immediately

906
00:55:18,105 --> 00:55:19,629
Down with music power!

907
00:55:20,274 --> 00:55:21,639
Down with assembly line
music!

908
00:55:22,376 --> 00:55:23,707
It's gotta stop!

909
00:55:24,578 --> 00:55:26,512
Stop!

910
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:34,351
Take a look, what's
on my head?

911
00:55:36,223 --> 00:55:37,383
Let me taste

912
00:55:40,093 --> 00:55:41,617
What is it you want?

913
00:55:42,996 --> 00:55:44,486
Moron, it's raining!

914
00:55:44,865 --> 00:55:46,730
I'll not be insulted!

915
00:55:52,139 --> 00:55:53,106
What's he doing?

916
00:55:55,075 --> 00:55:57,100
Look at how one can
ruin his life...

917
00:56:00,614 --> 00:56:01,273
Again...

918
00:56:02,883 --> 00:56:03,372
Another?

919
00:56:08,322 --> 00:56:09,653
Down with the baton!

920
00:56:09,957 --> 00:56:11,390
Music belongs to us!

921
00:56:12,292 --> 00:56:14,726
You don't exist! Who is he?

922
00:56:14,995 --> 00:56:16,724
I ask you, who is he?

923
00:56:17,464 --> 00:56:20,331
He doesn't exist. And if
he does, he shouldn't!

924
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:29,267
There's blood. Wretches!
Madmen!

925
00:56:29,476 --> 00:56:31,171
"You're fucked,
you're through"

926
00:56:31,345 --> 00:56:32,812
"It's all over for you"

927
00:56:34,147 --> 00:56:36,172
May I sit down for
the interview?

928
00:56:43,957 --> 00:56:45,481
I was first aware
of the harp...

929
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:47,989
...in a dream.
I was very little

930
00:56:48,495 --> 00:56:51,328
I didn't know what
to think...

931
00:56:51,498 --> 00:56:53,796
...of that small gold cage

932
00:56:56,637 --> 00:56:58,195
One day, in a book...

933
00:56:58,272 --> 00:56:59,796
...I saw Nero, and Rome
that was burning

934
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:02,975
...and the instrument
I had dreamt

935
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:07,480
And then in a perfumed
calendar there was...

936
00:57:07,648 --> 00:57:10,640
...an angel flying and
he played the same harp...

937
00:57:10,951 --> 00:57:12,350
...of my dreams

938
00:57:13,387 --> 00:57:14,149
The harp!

939
00:57:14,588 --> 00:57:16,488
For me it's a human presence

940
00:57:17,157 --> 00:57:20,752
I couldn't live in a house
without a 60 harp

941
00:57:21,762 --> 00:57:23,821
I'd never fall asleep
if I didn't know...

942
00:57:24,865 --> 00:57:27,129
...it was nearby in
the next room

943
00:57:28,735 --> 00:57:30,999
At times hands seem
to run across it

944
00:57:31,972 --> 00:57:32,700
I hear it play

945
00:57:33,974 --> 00:57:34,770
...it could be the wind

946
00:57:43,550 --> 00:57:45,245
The harp is my very life

947
00:57:46,687 --> 00:57:48,450
Not only for what
I have earned

948
00:57:49,323 --> 00:57:50,756
...but it's my refuge

949
00:57:51,658 --> 00:57:52,454
...my friend

950
00:57:53,994 --> 00:57:56,792
I've always lived alone.
No men

951
00:57:57,731 --> 00:57:58,663
No one

952
00:57:59,399 --> 00:58:00,093
...only the harp

953
00:58:01,068 --> 00:58:02,660
We confide, we talk...

954
00:58:03,337 --> 00:58:05,532
...it answers me,
I receive sensations

955
00:58:05,973 --> 00:58:09,204
...fantasies... an
overwhelming sense of joy

956
00:58:09,876 --> 00:58:11,002
...and of sadness

957
00:58:12,145 --> 00:58:15,137
Mostly, it gives one...

958
00:58:15,415 --> 00:58:16,040
...faith

959
00:58:16,984 --> 00:58:17,973
You become aware...

960
00:58:18,151 --> 00:58:20,142
...that other
dimensions exist

961
00:58:25,058 --> 00:58:26,286
A child once asked:

962
00:58:26,493 --> 00:58:28,358
"Where does music go
when it's over?"

963
00:58:29,696 --> 00:58:31,323
...only a child could
ask that

964
00:58:33,033 --> 00:58:35,661
"Orchestra - terror
Conductor - death"

965
00:58:36,069 --> 00:58:38,970
"Orchestra - terror
Conductor - death"

966
00:58:39,539 --> 00:58:42,474
"Orchestra - terror
Who plays is a traitor"

967
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:08,700
Here's our new conductor!

968
00:59:18,311 --> 00:59:19,938
Long live the Metronome!

969
00:59:21,615 --> 00:59:24,448
"Metronome metronomous...
Musicians - autonomous"

970
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:49,704
"Musicians at last
freed from the past"

971
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:55,273
Down with the metronome.
We'll establish...

972
00:59:55,415 --> 00:59:57,440
...the tempo, the rhythm,
the cadence

973
00:59:57,617 --> 01:00:01,314
We've had enough
of their music

974
01:00:01,555 --> 01:00:06,822
...it's degrading!
We play it, we'll create it,

975
01:00:06,993 --> 01:00:07,687
we'll manage it

976
01:00:08,562 --> 01:00:09,722
I'll not...

977
01:00:10,330 --> 01:00:11,797
...be directed by anyone!

978
01:00:11,998 --> 01:00:13,898
Death!

979
01:00:14,067 --> 01:00:14,897
...to the metronome!

980
01:01:09,656 --> 01:01:11,351
Idiot! Give me that gun

981
01:01:11,725 --> 01:01:12,521
...gimme

982
01:01:15,862 --> 01:01:18,353
You're hurting me.
I have a permit

983
01:01:19,166 --> 01:01:20,793
Look in my wallet

984
01:01:21,868 --> 01:01:23,233
All right let's see it

985
01:01:27,541 --> 01:01:28,701
...in his name

986
01:01:29,676 --> 01:01:32,907
A regular firearm permit

987
01:01:34,114 --> 01:01:34,808
Get up...

988
01:01:39,352 --> 01:01:40,114
A Smith & Wesson!

989
01:02:00,207 --> 01:02:02,767
Look up there... up there!

990
01:02:08,715 --> 01:02:09,409
Look!

991
01:02:17,290 --> 01:02:18,814
Everything's...

992
01:02:18,992 --> 01:02:19,890
...crumbling!

993
01:02:25,665 --> 01:02:26,529
Help me...

994
01:03:04,804 --> 01:03:05,566
Help me...

995
01:03:26,092 --> 01:03:26,786
Oh, why?

996
01:03:36,636 --> 01:03:37,500
...you are here...

997
01:03:39,139 --> 01:03:39,901
...and I'm here...

998
01:04:04,130 --> 01:04:06,598
Everyone must give undivided
attention to his instrument

999
01:04:08,735 --> 01:04:11,033
...that is all we can do now

1000
01:04:12,906 --> 01:04:14,305
Somebody can help me?

1001
01:04:15,008 --> 01:04:15,599
...please

1002
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:28,310
The notes are saving us

1003
01:04:31,124 --> 01:04:32,022
Music saves us

1004
01:04:33,226 --> 01:04:34,352
Hang on to the notes

1005
01:04:37,430 --> 01:04:38,454
Follow the notes

1006
01:04:41,301 --> 01:04:42,290
...one after the other...

1007
01:04:43,970 --> 01:04:45,301
In the way my hand...

1008
01:04:46,673 --> 01:04:47,605
...can indicate

1009
01:04:49,909 --> 01:04:51,274
We are musicians...

1010
01:04:53,380 --> 01:04:55,075
You are musicians...

1011
01:05:07,026 --> 01:05:07,788
...and we're here

1012
01:05:08,728 --> 01:05:09,251
...to rehearse

1013
01:05:20,573 --> 01:05:22,632
Have no fear.
The rehearsal continues

1014
01:05:23,710 --> 01:05:24,642
To your places!

1015
01:05:25,512 --> 01:05:26,376
In place, please

1016
01:05:30,950 --> 01:05:31,644
...thank you...

1017
01:08:18,885 --> 01:08:21,183
You must do less coloring
with sounds

1018
01:08:21,588 --> 01:08:23,852
Noise is not music

1019
01:08:24,424 --> 01:08:26,085
Not a trolley car,
I heard pots and pans

1020
01:08:26,426 --> 01:08:28,223
Where are we?

1021
01:08:29,062 --> 01:08:32,225
...one a soccer field?
You think I'm an umpire?

1022
01:08:33,333 --> 01:08:35,062
And where has
the brass gone?

1023
01:08:35,435 --> 01:08:37,300
What's happened to
your little lungs?

1024
01:08:38,605 --> 01:08:39,936
Where is all your breath?

1025
01:08:40,773 --> 01:08:42,263
...used it for
stupid chatter?

1026
01:08:43,209 --> 01:08:44,267
Sustain the notes!

1027
01:08:57,290 --> 01:08:58,951
Gentlemen... DA CAPO!
