1
00:00:01,618 --> 00:00:04,118
We really should prep for 
your Katie Couric interview.

2
00:00:08,619 --> 00:00:10,037
Fine.

3
00:00:11,364 --> 00:00:13,074
I wrote a brief synopsis
on the collapse

4
00:00:13,115 --> 00:00:15,701
of Lehman Brothers
and the financial crisis.

5
00:00:15,743 --> 00:00:17,077
If you internalize this document

6
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:20,455
you should be able to field basic
questions about the bail-out.

7
00:00:31,549 --> 00:00:33,551
Governor...

8
00:00:33,551 --> 00:00:35,928
The Dow just dropped 500 points.

9
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,055
Lehman is collapsing.

10
00:00:38,096 --> 00:00:40,015
The world economyisis on
the brink of collapse.

11
00:00:40,057 --> 00:00:42,934
I am pretty sure the bail-out
is going to come up.

12
00:00:47,397 --> 00:00:49,690
Okay. Um...

13
00:00:53,903 --> 00:00:56,613
Why don't we come back to it
after we've warmed up a bit?

14
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,202
I've put together a list of the questions

15
00:01:02,202 --> 00:01:04,746
that Katie's most likely to ask.

16
00:01:04,746 --> 00:01:07,415
I used to work with Katie, and I
know she'll ask about abortion.

17
00:01:07,457 --> 00:01:09,009
Did Steve do the Alaska poll yet?

18
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:12,170
- I think it's being done as we speak.
- Bet he didn't even do it.

19
00:01:17,841 --> 00:01:20,886
Can we try and get through
just a few questions?

20
00:01:26,441 --> 00:01:29,193
I know you're upset, Governor.

21
00:01:29,735 --> 00:01:31,445
So why don't you get a good night's sleep

22
00:01:31,487 --> 00:01:33,197
and I will come back
first thing in the morning

23
00:01:33,238 --> 00:01:34,940
to prep you when you're feeling better?

24
00:01:42,831 --> 00:01:45,458
I'm gonna leave this for you to...

25
00:01:46,459 --> 00:01:48,753
...look over.

26
00:01:51,722 --> 00:01:54,925
It's the worst financial crisis
facing the American people

27
00:01:54,967 --> 00:01:57,761
since the great depression
of the 1920s and 30s.

28
00:01:57,761 --> 00:01:59,847
The president's massive
financial rescue plan

29
00:01:59,888 --> 00:02:01,848
under fire from the left and right.

30
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,475
Good evening from the Ford Center

31
00:02:03,517 --> 00:02:05,852
at the University of Mississippi at Oxford.

32
00:02:05,894 --> 00:02:07,896
We're here for the first of three debates

33
00:02:07,937 --> 00:02:09,272
between Senator Barack Obama

34
00:02:09,314 --> 00:02:11,232
Steve, Steve, let's not
worry about that crap.

35
00:02:11,274 --> 00:02:12,858
It's all bullshit.

36
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,743
I'm here at the podium.

37
00:02:14,785 --> 00:02:17,204
Let's do the fucking debate.

38
00:02:18,072 --> 00:02:19,698
Hey, John. Sorry to interrupt.

39
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,451
I just spoke to our guy at Treasury.

40
00:02:22,451 --> 00:02:25,245
The bill does not have
enough Republican votes.

41
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:26,496
God damn it.

42
00:02:26,538 --> 00:02:28,456
Paulson thinks the entire world economy

43
00:02:28,498 --> 00:02:31,292
is on the brink of falling
off the cliff, so...

44
00:02:31,334 --> 00:02:34,545
We're checkmated.
If the bail-out doesn't pass,

45
00:02:34,587 --> 00:02:36,630
we're screwed because Bush, and thus you,

46
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,298
will be blamed for it.

47
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,968
- If you pass the bail-out
- The Republicans will despise me

48
00:02:41,009 --> 00:02:43,303
- for supporting a bail-out.
-  That's it.

49
00:02:44,854 --> 00:02:46,522
This is it, guys.

50
00:02:46,564 --> 00:02:48,641
I mean, this is the whole fucking election.

51
00:02:48,683 --> 00:02:51,561
Now, we think you should
suspend the campaign

52
00:02:51,561 --> 00:02:53,980
postpone the debates, go to Washington

53
00:02:54,021 --> 00:02:57,566
and try to negotiate
a bi-partisan compromise.

54
00:02:58,066 --> 00:03:00,360
You need to make a bold move, John.

55
00:03:02,395 --> 00:03:04,314
This is a big risk.

56
00:03:04,656 --> 00:03:06,541
I mean, that's a big gamble.

57
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:09,952
We gotta do something.

58
00:03:09,994 --> 00:03:12,497
Nothing can fuck me more than this.

59
00:03:13,539 --> 00:03:16,998
Governor, have you had a chance to
go over the briefing materials on the bail-out?

60
00:03:19,845 --> 00:03:21,638
I really think we need
to try and nail down

61
00:03:21,638 --> 00:03:23,973
a simple two-sentence response
to the economic crisis.

62
00:03:24,015 --> 00:03:26,768
- It's gotta be supportive of the concept...
- That's enough powder.

63
00:03:26,768 --> 00:03:29,437
...of the bail-out, but also
disappointed that we're at this point

64
00:03:29,478 --> 00:03:32,773
making it clear that changes
need to be made to the bill.

65
00:03:34,149 --> 00:03:35,567
Oh, you need it a little higher?

66
00:03:35,609 --> 00:03:37,861
I can do that. I can do that for you.

67
00:03:39,196 --> 00:03:41,489
That jacket looks fantastic
on you, by the way.

68
00:03:41,231 --> 00:03:43,150
It's too open.

69
00:03:43,491 --> 00:03:45,860
- Don't you think so
- Yeah, it looks wonderful.

70
00:03:45,902 --> 00:03:47,320
Really great, really nice.

71
00:03:47,362 --> 00:03:49,197
It's a great color.

72
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,354
Do you want me to read the paper to you?

73
00:04:02,634 --> 00:04:06,046
Senator John McCain has requested of
his opponent, Senator Barack Obama,

74
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,339
a postponement of the upcoming debate

75
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:10,842
so that both Senators
may return to Capitol Hill

76
00:04:10,842 --> 00:04:13,552
to address the needs of the
country in this crucial time.

77
00:04:13,552 --> 00:04:15,346
Senator Obama has said...

78
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:22,936
I hate this make-up. I hate it.

79
00:04:23,578 --> 00:04:25,572
I don't like my hair this way.
I like my hair up.

80
00:04:25,613 --> 00:04:27,198
Governor, you look amazing.

81
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,077
I look fat. I'm sick of looking fat.

82
00:04:31,118 --> 00:04:34,121
- You don't look fat.
- Can I get some more tape?

83
00:04:37,339 --> 00:04:38,166
Yeah.

84
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:40,043
I don't know if we should do Couric.

85
00:04:40,085 --> 00:04:41,628
She's having a mini-meltdown.

86
00:04:41,628 --> 00:04:43,838
Well, we can't have McCain
cancel the debate

87
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,674
and Palin cancel Katie Couric
in the same week.

88
00:04:46,716 --> 00:04:47,901
I know.

89
00:04:48,042 --> 00:04:49,544
But I'm really worried about her.

90
00:04:49,885 --> 00:04:52,388
She won't respond to anything I say.

91
00:04:52,429 --> 00:04:54,723
Maybe we should bring McCain
in and see what he thinks.

92
00:04:54,723 --> 00:04:56,250
He doesn't want to deal with her.

93
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,719
I haven't even told him
that she doesn't know anything.

94
00:04:59,019 --> 00:05:00,846
You haven't told him?

95
00:05:01,388 --> 00:05:03,473
Look, he doesn't want to know.

96
00:05:03,515 --> 00:05:05,517
The world economy is on the brink of collapse.

97
00:05:05,558 --> 00:05:09,062
Can you just...
prep her in the car ride over?

98
00:05:09,103 --> 00:05:12,648
Uh, I can try.

99
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:16,860
Okay, good. Try. Thanks.

100
00:05:17,202 --> 00:05:20,554
Knowing Katie, I'm sure she's going to ask
about your stance on feminism.

101
00:05:20,814 --> 00:05:22,607
- Did you get the numbers?
- The what?

102
00:05:22,807 --> 00:05:24,852
My approval rating in Alaska?

103
00:05:25,593 --> 00:05:26,554
They're not in yet.

104
00:05:27,695 --> 00:05:29,322
I am trying to trust you people,

105
00:05:29,363 --> 00:05:31,607
but you're making it really hard for me.

106
00:05:32,149 --> 00:05:34,401
I'm sorry, Governor.

107
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:35,953
I'll call Steve right away about it.

108
00:05:36,095 --> 00:05:37,671
Yeah, like that'll do anything.

109
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:43,585
What are you working on, Governor?

110
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:47,956
It's a questionnaire from the Matsu
Valley Frontiersman in Wasilla.

111
00:05:48,297 --> 00:05:50,174
You know, an Alaska paper.

112
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:53,676
Don't you think we should prepare
for your national Couric interview first?

113
00:05:53,844 --> 00:05:56,930
No, Nicolle, I don't. This is my priority.

114
00:05:57,072 --> 00:06:02,027
I am not going to ignore
the people of Alaska any more.

115
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,572
You've cited Alaska's proximity to Russia

116
00:06:14,713 --> 00:06:16,524
as part of your foreign policy experience.

117
00:06:16,624 --> 00:06:17,833
What did you mean by that?

118
00:06:18,275 --> 00:06:21,461
That Alaska has a very
narrow maritime border

119
00:06:21,503 --> 00:06:24,965
between a foreign country,
Russia, and on our other side,

120
00:06:25,006 --> 00:06:28,968
the land boundary that we have with Canada.

121
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:31,471
It's funny that a comment like that

122
00:06:31,512 --> 00:06:35,891
was kind of made to...

123
00:06:35,933 --> 00:06:37,893
I don't know. You know, reporters.

124
00:06:38,034 --> 00:06:39,019
Mocked?

125
00:06:39,061 --> 00:06:40,437
Yeah, mocked. I guess that's the word, yeah.

126
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,898
Well, explain to me why that enhances

127
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:44,816
your foreign policy credentials.

128
00:06:44,858 --> 00:06:48,528
Well, it certainly does because our

129
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:50,947
our next-door neighbors
are foreign countries.

130
00:06:51,288 --> 00:06:55,125
They're in the state
that I am the executive of.

131
00:06:55,167 --> 00:06:57,711
Have you ever been involved
with any negotiations

132
00:06:57,753 --> 00:06:59,546
for example, with the Russians?

133
00:06:59,588 --> 00:07:01,464
We have trade missions back and forth.

134
00:07:01,506 --> 00:07:03,174
We do. It's very important

135
00:07:03,216 --> 00:07:06,386
when you consider even national
security issues with Russia,

136
00:07:06,727 --> 00:07:09,764
as Putin rears his head
and comes into the airspace

137
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:11,849
of the United States of America,

138
00:07:11,891 --> 00:07:13,642
where do they go?

139
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:16,478
It's Alaska. It's just
right over the border.

140
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,814
And when it comes to
establishing your world-view,

141
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,817
I was curious, what
newspapers and magazines

142
00:07:22,017 --> 00:07:25,804
did you regularly read before
you were tapped for this

143
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,114
to stay informed and to understand...

144
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,917
I've read most of them,
again with a great appreciation

145
00:07:31,058 --> 00:07:32,802
for the press, for the media.

146
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:35,579
What ones specifically? I'm curious.

147
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,164
Name one fucking paper.

148
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:38,957
All of 'em. Any of 'em.

149
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:42,043
..that have been in front of me
over all these years.

150
00:07:42,785 --> 00:07:44,879
Oh, my God. What have we done?

151
00:07:44,921 --> 00:07:47,465
If John McCain wins, this woman will be

152
00:07:47,507 --> 00:07:50,134
one 72-year-old's heartbeat away

153
00:07:50,134 --> 00:07:52,720
from President of the United States.

154
00:07:52,761 --> 00:07:55,097
And if that doesn't scare
the hell out of you, it should.

155
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:57,182
In fairness, probably most people

156
00:07:57,224 --> 00:07:59,426
can't name a Supreme Court case.

157
00:07:59,526 --> 00:08:01,945
But most people are not campaigning

158
00:08:02,187 --> 00:08:03,730
- to be Vice President.
- Right, right.

159
00:08:03,772 --> 00:08:06,357
It's not that she doesn't
know the right answer.

160
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:09,360
It's that she clearly does not
understand the question.

161
00:08:09,402 --> 00:08:12,780
This is way beyond anything we have ever seen

162
00:08:12,822 --> 00:08:14,573
from a national candidate.

163
00:08:19,036 --> 00:08:20,370
Why did you make me do Katie Couric?

164
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:23,331
Did you see the coverage? Did you?

165
00:08:23,573 --> 00:08:25,375
Are you there? Are you listening to me?

166
00:08:25,575 --> 00:08:27,418
Yes, Governor. I'm here.

167
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,836
Katie was a logical choice.

168
00:08:28,878 --> 00:08:30,796
She's been very fair to us
this entire campaign.

169
00:08:30,838 --> 00:08:32,131
You call that interview fair?

170
00:08:32,131 --> 00:08:33,716
Yes, Governor, I do.

171
00:08:33,757 --> 00:08:36,293
I certainly don't.
She was out to get me from the get-go.

172
00:08:36,393 --> 00:08:37,770
No, she wasn't.

173
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,346
The interview sucked
because you didn't try.

174
00:08:39,688 --> 00:08:41,097
What do you mean, I didn't try?

175
00:08:41,139 --> 00:08:42,474
You didn't fight back like you did

176
00:08:42,515 --> 00:08:43,558
in the Charlie Gibson interview.

177
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,726
When you didn't know the answers,

178
00:08:44,767 --> 00:08:46,436
you clawed your way back
and it went fine.

179
00:08:46,436 --> 00:08:47,562
You just gave up.

180
00:08:47,804 --> 00:08:49,555
Nicolle, it wasn't my fault.

181
00:08:49,755 --> 00:08:51,390
I wasn't properly prepped.

182
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:54,652
You weren't properly prepped
because you wouldn't listen to us.

183
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,695
You never listen to your advisors.

184
00:08:56,737 --> 00:08:58,613
Because you're overwhelming me

185
00:08:58,655 --> 00:09:00,490
with too much information.

186
00:09:00,532 --> 00:09:02,409
I don't want to do these interviews.

187
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,594
I want to do what I want to do.

188
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,663
We're just trying to help you
get through this, Governor.

189
00:09:07,705 --> 00:09:09,498
All we want is for you to succeed.

190
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,417
Yeah, well, you're not helping.

191
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:13,210
You're just screwing me up.

192
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:16,296
You're telling me what to say,
what to wear, how to talk.

193
00:09:16,296 --> 00:09:18,256
I am not your puppet!

194
00:09:18,298 --> 00:09:19,758
Now I understand what Hillary meant

195
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,343
when she said she had
to find her own voice.

196
00:09:22,384 --> 00:09:24,971
Yeah, 'cause you're just like Hillary.

197
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:29,183
You have ruined me.

198
00:09:29,225 --> 00:09:31,394
You have ruined my reputation.

199
00:09:31,435 --> 00:09:34,521
I am ruined in Alaska!

200
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:46,157
This is Steve Schmidt. Leave a message.

201
00:09:46,199 --> 00:09:47,992
Steve, it's Nicolle.

202
00:09:48,034 --> 00:09:50,228
I will gladly resign if you
want to blame me for Couric.

203
00:09:50,528 --> 00:09:53,205
But if you want me to stay, then
I'm back on McCain's bus tomorrow

204
00:09:53,247 --> 00:09:55,833
as I never want to deal
with that woman ever again.

205
00:09:57,609 --> 00:09:59,787
What lessons have you learned from Iraq

206
00:10:00,087 --> 00:10:03,623
and how specifically would
you spread democracy abroad?

207
00:10:03,923 --> 00:10:06,543
Specifically, we would make
every effort possible

208
00:10:06,843 --> 00:10:09,128
to spread democracy abroad
to those who want it.

209
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:15,801
Yes, but specifically, what would you do?

210
00:10:16,101 --> 00:10:17,720
We're gonna promote freedom,

211
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,347
Usher in democratic values and ideals,

212
00:10:20,689 --> 00:10:23,100
and fight terror-loving terrorists.

213
00:10:25,985 --> 00:10:28,688
But again, and not to belabor the point,

214
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,606
one specific thing.

215
00:10:39,747 --> 00:10:41,908
Katie, I'd like to use one of my lifelines.

216
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:52,368
-  I'm sorry?
-  I want to phone a friend.

217
00:10:54,611 --> 00:10:56,230
Friday's debate should proceed.

218
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:58,032
We've been working around the clock

219
00:10:58,273 --> 00:11:00,642
and presidents are going
to have to deal with

220
00:11:01,184 --> 00:11:02,803
more than one thing at a time.

221
00:11:03,144 --> 00:11:04,804
A new CNN/Time opinion research poll

222
00:11:05,104 --> 00:11:08,183
- show Obama surging in key battleground states.
- Son of a bitch.

223
00:11:08,524 --> 00:11:10,309
like Pennsylvania where he
is now up by nine points.

224
00:11:10,651 --> 00:11:12,645
Governor, I just want you to know

225
00:11:12,987 --> 00:11:14,730
I got your Alaskan poll numbers in,

226
00:11:15,072 --> 00:11:16,690
and you'll be pleased to know

227
00:11:17,032 --> 00:11:19,818
- that you're in the low 70s.
-  Fine.

228
00:11:27,917 --> 00:11:30,328
- Why are they fucking me like this?
- Who?

229
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:33,456
The press! They used to love me.

230
00:11:33,797 --> 00:11:36,917
Now all they want to do
in life is fuck me over.

231
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:39,211
I can't believe Katie did that to me.

232
00:11:39,553 --> 00:11:41,755
And did you hear what Olbermann
said about me last night?

233
00:11:42,097 --> 00:11:45,300
Sir, you've got to stop
watching Keith Olbermann.

234
00:11:45,642 --> 00:11:48,553
Or Fox, for that matter.
It's all just bullshit.

235
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,932
Now, sir, you should have a beer

236
00:11:53,274 --> 00:11:54,809
and watch ESPN, okay?

237
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,227
And while you're watching it,

238
00:11:56,568 --> 00:11:58,520
think about what
the people who watch ESPN

239
00:11:58,862 --> 00:12:00,439
really need in their lives right now.

240
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,065
I thought Katie liked me.

241
00:12:02,407 --> 00:12:05,151
She does. And the questions were fair.

242
00:12:05,493 --> 00:12:08,905
It was Governor Palin
who gave a terrible interview.

243
00:12:09,205 --> 00:12:10,573
That poor girl.

244
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,784
She wasn't ready for this.

245
00:12:14,126 --> 00:12:16,954
Yeah, I'm afraid you're right, sir.

246
00:12:17,254 --> 00:12:21,250
And YouTube is making it
exponentially worse.

247
00:12:21,591 --> 00:12:23,543
People are watching
Katie Couric and Tina Fey

248
00:12:23,885 --> 00:12:25,003
over and over again.

249
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:27,547
It's playing like
an infinite loop on the web.

250
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:30,667
No presidential campaign has ever
had to deal with this before.

251
00:12:31,008 --> 00:12:34,545
But she's gonna do a good job
in the debate, right?

252
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:37,389
Yes, sir. She'll be great.

253
00:12:37,689 --> 00:12:39,892
'Cause if it goes like Couric,
I don't think we can recover.

254
00:12:40,133 --> 00:12:43,170
I agree, and I promise she'll be great.

255
00:12:43,611 --> 00:12:45,105
I hope you're right.

256
00:12:46,989 --> 00:12:49,192
I hope you're right, Steve.

257
00:12:49,592 --> 00:12:51,194
It's gonna be fine.

258
00:12:59,918 --> 00:13:03,080
Okay, this one came up
in the '96 debate.

259
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,789
Is there a magic bullet

260
00:13:05,089 --> 00:13:06,875
to solve the problem
of public education?

261
00:13:07,216 --> 00:13:09,836
If not, what is the best solution?

262
00:13:13,347 --> 00:13:15,341
Governor?

263
00:13:22,063 --> 00:13:24,349
Governor, would you like
something to eat?

264
00:13:27,068 --> 00:13:30,646
Yeah, I think you should
eat something, Governor.

265
00:13:30,946 --> 00:13:32,398
How about a diet Dr Pepper?

266
00:13:32,698 --> 00:13:34,108
Would you like--
could you?

267
00:13:37,327 --> 00:13:39,071
Governor?

268
00:13:40,956 --> 00:13:43,867
I miss my baby.
I miss sleeping with my baby.

269
00:13:46,127 --> 00:13:48,496
She constantly slips
into these catatonic stupors.

270
00:13:48,838 --> 00:13:50,331
And then when we do
finally get her to work,

271
00:13:50,673 --> 00:13:52,124
she writes all the information down on notecards

272
00:13:52,424 --> 00:13:54,085
but she can't remember any of it.

273
00:13:55,677 --> 00:13:58,804
Steve, did you do an approval poll in Alaska?
She keeps bringing it up.

274
00:13:59,046 --> 00:13:59,856
What the fuck?

275
00:14:00,098 --> 00:14:02,134
I did that stupid fucking poll a week ago.

276
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:03,844
I told her she's in the 70s.

277
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:05,362
Yeah, well, I don't think
she believes you.

278
00:14:05,462 --> 00:14:06,663
She says you made those numbers up.

279
00:14:08,856 --> 00:14:11,893
- She is becoming completely irrational.
- Becoming?

280
00:14:14,611 --> 00:14:15,813
I don't even like to say this,

281
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:17,481
but has it occurred to you guys

282
00:14:17,781 --> 00:14:19,358
that she might be mentally unstable?

283
00:14:22,952 --> 00:14:25,780
Mark, look, the debate is in five days.

284
00:14:26,122 --> 00:14:27,657
What do you think?

285
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:33,329
I think this debate will
be a debacle of historic

286
00:14:33,629 --> 00:14:35,873
and epic proportions.

287
00:14:38,517 --> 00:14:40,352
Well, that's encouraging.

288
00:14:56,608 --> 00:14:58,519
What would you say best qualifies you

289
00:14:58,819 --> 00:15:00,896
to be John McCain's running mate?

290
00:15:02,739 --> 00:15:06,276
John McCain has that streak
of Independence in him

291
00:15:06,576 --> 00:15:09,904
that I think is very, very
important in our leadership today.

292
00:15:10,246 --> 00:15:11,697
I have that within me also.

293
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:13,866
And that's why John McCain tapped me

294
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:15,784
to be a team of mavericks

295
00:15:16,126 --> 00:15:18,871
of Independence, as a team member

296
00:15:19,212 --> 00:15:21,623
on this, um--
in this new team.

297
00:15:21,965 --> 00:15:23,959
Um, I'm gonna do
that one over again.

298
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,377
- Yeah, sure.
-  John?

299
00:15:25,718 --> 00:15:28,046
Governor, important to remember

300
00:15:28,387 --> 00:15:30,882
that you don't need
to say anything specific.

301
00:15:31,223 --> 00:15:33,551
Okay. If you don't know
the answer to the question

302
00:15:34,092 --> 00:15:36,528
just bring it back to the general
theme of reforming America

303
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,381
or pivot to one of your
stronger suits, like energy.

304
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:42,017
Yeah, 'cause that's where
I'm most comfortable.

305
00:15:42,259 --> 00:15:44,002
That's pretty clear.

306
00:15:44,502 --> 00:15:45,912
Let's try another question.

307
00:15:46,454 --> 00:15:47,313
Global warming.

308
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:48,898
Governor Palin, do you believe

309
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,067
that global warming is man-made?

310
00:15:56,029 --> 00:15:57,906
I think all this talk and gibber-gabber

311
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:01,285
about where global warming
comes from defeats

312
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:04,162
defeats, you know, the point
that it's getting hotter

313
00:16:04,462 --> 00:16:08,208
and that we all need to be
very concerned about heat.

314
00:16:08,508 --> 00:16:10,334
And, um...

315
00:16:10,634 --> 00:16:11,752
That, um...

316
00:16:12,094 --> 00:16:13,838
I...

317
00:16:14,138 --> 00:16:15,456
forgot it and it's not in this--

318
00:16:15,597 --> 00:16:18,467
Mark, all the cards are
supposed to be in this pile.

319
00:16:18,809 --> 00:16:20,219
It's not in this pile.

320
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,763
I think we need to take a break.

321
00:16:23,104 --> 00:16:24,806
Can you all leave us
alone for a minute?

322
00:16:36,325 --> 00:16:37,860
The debate is in four days,

323
00:16:38,201 --> 00:16:40,237
and this isn't working, Governor.

324
00:16:40,837 --> 00:16:42,239
I know.

325
00:16:46,084 --> 00:16:49,746
I think you should get off
this no-carb diet immediately.

326
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:53,040
This goofy diet is bad for you

327
00:16:53,382 --> 00:16:55,084
and I'm alarmed by your weight loss.

328
00:16:57,094 --> 00:17:00,547
Governor, the Katie Couric
interview didn't go well.

329
00:17:01,289 --> 00:17:04,001
And it wasn't Nicolle Wallace's fault.

330
00:17:04,442 --> 00:17:05,811
It wasn't Katie Couric's fault.

331
00:17:06,352 --> 00:17:08,096
It wasn't the liberal media's fault.

332
00:17:08,437 --> 00:17:11,307
It was your fault,
because you didn't prepare.

333
00:17:11,607 --> 00:17:13,392
And there can never be another instance

334
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:16,529
of something not going well
because you didn't prepare.

335
00:17:27,789 --> 00:17:29,824
Hey.

336
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:31,542
Hey, hey, hey.

337
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,244
Look, you had a bad interview.

338
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:36,539
It's okay, it happens.

339
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:41,335
You know what Ronald Reagan
said caused pollution?

340
00:17:42,886 --> 00:17:44,296
Trees.

341
00:17:49,141 --> 00:17:51,511
- Reagan said that?
- He did.

342
00:17:51,852 --> 00:17:53,929
He said trees cause pollution.

343
00:17:54,829 --> 00:17:57,057
And he not only won the election,

344
00:17:57,199 --> 00:17:59,818
he went on to be
a great president.

345
00:18:03,621 --> 00:18:07,609
I just-- I don't want
to let John down.

346
00:18:17,167 --> 00:18:18,452
Stevie boy.

347
00:18:18,752 --> 00:18:20,787
We have a problem, sir.

348
00:18:21,772 --> 00:18:23,599
What? What's going on?

349
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,167
It's, uh, Palin.

350
00:18:26,767 --> 00:18:29,921
She could be on the verge of a
complete nervous breakdown.

351
00:18:32,056 --> 00:18:34,884
I don't know what to do.

352
00:18:35,525 --> 00:18:38,345
We threw her into the deep end
without a life preserver.

353
00:18:38,587 --> 00:18:39,955
Yeah, and we're drowning
with her, sir.

354
00:18:42,649 --> 00:18:44,100
We need to get her back
with her family.

355
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,145
She needs to be surrounded by

356
00:18:47,645 --> 00:18:49,731
by people who love her.

357
00:18:51,157 --> 00:18:53,609
Hey, let's get 'em all out to Sedona.

358
00:18:53,951 --> 00:18:55,444
Out in the open air.

359
00:18:55,786 --> 00:18:57,196
My neighbor's a doctor,

360
00:18:57,496 --> 00:19:00,490
and Cindy can invite him over
for a barbeque or something

361
00:19:00,832 --> 00:19:02,159
and he can observe her

362
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,369
and see if it's truly serious.

363
00:19:04,711 --> 00:19:06,079
But let's just get 'em to Sedona.

364
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:08,414
It'll do wonders for her,
I know it.

365
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:10,408
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

366
00:19:46,874 --> 00:19:48,701
I missed you guys so much.

367
00:19:49,001 --> 00:19:52,562
- Hi! Mommy!
- Oh, my goodness!

368
00:19:53,614 --> 00:19:54,707
Got someone who wants to say hi.

369
00:20:00,137 --> 00:20:02,005
-  What's up, doc?
- Hey, how you doing?

370
00:20:02,747 --> 00:20:05,508
That depends. How's she look?

371
00:20:05,808 --> 00:20:07,760
For a woman who's just had a baby,

372
00:20:08,102 --> 00:20:10,763
has a pregnant teen daughter
and a son in Iraq,

373
00:20:11,105 --> 00:20:13,516
I'd say not half bad.

374
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,353
You, however, look like shit.

375
00:20:20,155 --> 00:20:21,732
They keep piling all this stuff on me,

376
00:20:22,032 --> 00:20:23,692
and I just can't remember everything.

377
00:20:23,992 --> 00:20:26,403
- Are you getting some of it?
- Yeah.

378
00:20:26,744 --> 00:20:28,196
Some, but I have to talk

379
00:20:28,538 --> 00:20:31,282
for like 90 minutes up there.

380
00:20:31,624 --> 00:20:33,534
Do you remember when you debated Halcro?

381
00:20:34,752 --> 00:20:36,328
He had no notes, no papers,

382
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:39,623
and he could spout off
all these facts and figures?

383
00:20:39,965 --> 00:20:42,042
You were so intimidated...

384
00:20:43,426 --> 00:20:44,628
Until you looked out at the audience.

385
00:20:45,128 --> 00:20:46,254
What'd you realize?

386
00:20:46,596 --> 00:20:48,715
That none of what he said mattered,

387
00:20:49,015 --> 00:20:50,842
because no one knew
what he was talking about.

388
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:54,011
It's the same thing here, baby.
It's just more people.

389
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:56,388
You're getting yourself in trouble

390
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:57,890
because they're trying to turn you

391
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,892
into something that you're not.

392
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:02,436
You gotta do what you do.

393
00:21:02,777 --> 00:21:05,480
Just talk to people
the way you talk to them.

394
00:21:05,822 --> 00:21:07,649
And they'll love you.

395
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,651
They always have.

396
00:21:10,951 --> 00:21:13,779
I love you first, dude.

397
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:15,823
I love you, too.

398
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:18,951
Mrs. Vice President.

399
00:21:51,238 --> 00:21:52,356
Steve, what's up?

400
00:21:52,698 --> 00:21:55,025
How many questions does Sarah Palin
have to answer in the debate?

401
00:21:55,367 --> 00:21:57,987
22 to 25.

402
00:21:58,328 --> 00:21:59,947
And how long is each answer?

403
00:22:00,488 --> 00:22:01,940
Two minutes with pivots.

404
00:22:02,082 --> 00:22:03,450
So if all we have to do

405
00:22:03,792 --> 00:22:06,161
is get the best actress
in American politics

406
00:22:06,502 --> 00:22:09,247
to memorize 45 minutes' worth of answers.

407
00:22:09,589 --> 00:22:11,374
Then why did we waste five days

408
00:22:11,674 --> 00:22:15,086
trying to get her to understand
what any of this shit means?

409
00:22:18,305 --> 00:22:20,048
Governor, I didn't know
you were going for a jog.

410
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:22,968
- I have a different strategy.
- I need to clear my head for a bit.

411
00:22:23,309 --> 00:22:25,170
Well, we really need to prepare--

412
00:22:25,311 --> 00:22:27,013
I really need to go running, Steve,

413
00:22:27,355 --> 00:22:28,723
'cause it's gonna make me feel better.

414
00:22:29,065 --> 00:22:30,141
Can you understand that?

415
00:22:30,741 --> 00:22:32,201
Of course, Governor.

416
00:22:45,922 --> 00:22:48,449
I think we need to get rid
of these notecards.

417
00:22:48,791 --> 00:22:51,744
- They're not helping.
- Okay.

418
00:22:52,286 --> 00:22:53,946
I hate those flippin' cards anyway.

419
00:22:55,188 --> 00:22:57,116
Now, what we need you to do

420
00:22:57,257 --> 00:23:00,794
is to memorize 25 answers and 4 attack lines.

421
00:23:01,136 --> 00:23:03,755
Do you think you can do that?

422
00:23:04,055 --> 00:23:05,256
Yeah, I can do that.

423
00:23:07,475 --> 00:23:09,344
And you're gonna be great.

424
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:30,238
And we are to be that
shining city on a hill

425
00:23:30,579 --> 00:23:33,240
as President Reagan
so beautifully said

426
00:23:33,582 --> 00:23:35,743
that we are a beacon of hope

427
00:23:36,043 --> 00:23:38,537
and that we are unapologetic here.

428
00:23:38,879 --> 00:23:39,913
Governor Palin

429
00:23:40,855 --> 00:23:43,583
nuclear Iran is one of our gravest threats.

430
00:23:43,925 --> 00:23:46,753
What would a McCain
administration do to stop it?

431
00:23:47,095 --> 00:23:49,255
On the subject of "nucular" Iran

432
00:23:49,597 --> 00:23:51,716
Senator O'Biden and I
are most likely in agreement.

433
00:23:52,057 --> 00:23:53,759
They cannot be allowed

434
00:23:54,101 --> 00:23:57,388
to acquire "nucular" weapons, period.

435
00:23:57,729 --> 00:23:59,515
Israel is in jeopardy, of course,

436
00:23:59,856 --> 00:24:01,183
when dealing
with Ahmadinejad

437
00:24:01,483 --> 00:24:03,685
as a leader of Iran.

438
00:24:04,027 --> 00:24:06,312
It was Ronald Reagan
who said that freedom

439
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:09,399
is always just one generation
away from extinction.

440
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:12,685
We don't pass it to our
children in the bloodstream,

441
00:24:13,026 --> 00:24:15,562
we have to fight for it and protect it

442
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:16,822
and then hand it to them

443
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:19,116
so that they shall do the same.

444
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:20,867
We will fight for it.

445
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:23,370
And there is only
one man in this race

446
00:24:23,711 --> 00:24:26,998
who has really ever fought for you

447
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,042
and that's Senator John McCain.

448
00:24:31,794 --> 00:24:32,912
Yeah, she's back!

449
00:24:33,953 --> 00:24:37,198
Sarah Palin is back,
ladies and gentlemen.

450
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,760
- Great job, Governor.
- It was pretty good, huh?

451
00:24:40,101 --> 00:24:41,261
Pretty good? It was amazing.

452
00:24:41,903 --> 00:24:43,813
There's just one slight
adjustment I want to give you.

453
00:24:44,055 --> 00:24:45,757
You need to call him Senator Biden

454
00:24:45,898 --> 00:24:48,434
- not Senator O'Biden.
- That's what I called him, Senator O'Biden.

455
00:24:48,834 --> 00:24:50,119
- You just said it again.
- Said what?

456
00:24:50,361 --> 00:24:52,355
- O'Biden.
- Right. Senator Biden.

457
00:24:52,696 --> 00:24:55,149
- That's it.
- Oh. Biden.

458
00:24:55,449 --> 00:24:58,235
- No, there's no "O."
- No, I meant "oh" as in "Oh, I get it"

459
00:24:58,577 --> 00:24:59,820
not "O" as in O'Biden.

460
00:25:00,762 --> 00:25:01,688
Oh.

461
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:03,949
Okay, well, let's practice it.

462
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:06,868
Governor, do you agree
with Senator Biden's

463
00:25:07,168 --> 00:25:08,328
position on the bail-out?

464
00:25:08,628 --> 00:25:10,079
- Senator O'Biden...
- Biden!

465
00:25:10,421 --> 00:25:11,539
Dog-gone it!

466
00:25:24,976 --> 00:25:27,053
- This is Sarah.
-  Hey, Mom.

467
00:25:27,395 --> 00:25:29,055
Hey, honey. How are ya?

468
00:25:29,397 --> 00:25:30,390
I'm good. I'm--

469
00:25:30,831 --> 00:25:32,767
- I'm good, Mom.
- Where are ya?

470
00:25:33,108 --> 00:25:35,019
Um, I'm not really allowed to say.

471
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,062
Okay, sweetie, but you're safe?

472
00:25:37,362 --> 00:25:39,106
Yeah, no, I'm fine, I'm fine.

473
00:25:39,448 --> 00:25:40,857
I just wanted to wish you a good debate.

474
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:42,843
Thank you.

475
00:25:43,684 --> 00:25:46,004
- Did you study?
- I did.

476
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:47,589
A lot.

477
00:25:47,989 --> 00:25:49,407
I'll be praying for you.

478
00:25:49,707 --> 00:25:50,783
Please, I'll need it.

479
00:25:51,125 --> 00:25:52,743
Come on, Mom, you're gonna do great.

480
00:25:54,503 --> 00:25:55,621
I love you.

481
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:57,706
I love you so much, Track.

482
00:25:58,048 --> 00:26:01,376
-  Fall in!
- I gotta go, Mom.

483
00:26:01,718 --> 00:26:03,503
No, no, no. Just...
just another minute.

484
00:26:03,803 --> 00:26:05,046
No, I'm really sorry,
but I really gotta go.

485
00:26:05,546 --> 00:26:06,873
You're gonna do
great tonight, okay?

486
00:26:07,014 --> 00:26:09,384
Thank you, thank you, but,
sweetie-- sweetie, you be safe.

487
00:26:10,684 --> 00:26:12,236
I will.

488
00:26:12,678 --> 00:26:14,129
Bye.

489
00:26:21,052 --> 00:26:22,337
You okay?

490
00:26:23,738 --> 00:26:25,282
My son is safe.

491
00:26:27,158 --> 00:26:28,368
My son is safe.

492
00:26:39,811 --> 00:26:41,638
What we are going to see

493
00:26:41,838 --> 00:26:43,999
is probably the most anticipated

494
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,709
vice presidential debate

495
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:48,336
that I have covered ever.

496
00:26:48,678 --> 00:26:50,630
A lot, a lot of pressure on Sarah Palin.

497
00:26:50,971 --> 00:26:52,506
As for Joe Biden, it's sort of a,

498
00:26:52,848 --> 00:26:54,759
first of all, do-no-harm night for him.

499
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:58,012
No one has questioned
that he is qualified

500
00:26:58,353 --> 00:26:59,388
to be vice president.

501
00:26:59,729 --> 00:27:00,931
He needs to, both of them,

502
00:27:01,273 --> 00:27:02,808
need to talk about the top of their tickets.

503
00:27:03,149 --> 00:27:05,602
After all, this isn't
a race to be vice president

504
00:27:05,944 --> 00:27:08,229
so much as it is to be number two

505
00:27:08,571 --> 00:27:10,148
to the top people on the ticket.

506
00:27:10,489 --> 00:27:12,775
On the Joe Biden side, you will see

507
00:27:13,117 --> 00:27:15,694
an effort to say, "Look, Sarah Palin..."

508
00:27:16,636 --> 00:27:18,530
Hurry.

509
00:27:19,172 --> 00:27:20,324
Pray with me.

510
00:27:20,665 --> 00:27:22,075
What should we pray for?

511
00:27:22,417 --> 00:27:24,619
Just pray that we win the debate.

512
00:27:24,961 --> 00:27:27,205
Mom, that would be cheating.

513
00:27:32,051 --> 00:27:33,753
Okay.

514
00:27:38,932 --> 00:27:40,175
We want to welcome our viewers

515
00:27:40,475 --> 00:27:41,718
in the United States
and around the world.

516
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:45,013
I'm Wolf Blitzer, together with the best...

517
00:27:45,355 --> 00:27:48,224
We've been waiting for this
night for a long time...

518
00:27:51,735 --> 00:27:54,688
I did this same walk for
Geraldine Ferraro in 1984.

519
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:56,106
Holy jeez, that's cool.

520
00:27:56,448 --> 00:27:57,691
This is your toe mark.

521
00:27:57,991 --> 00:27:59,359
Okay.

522
00:28:01,111 --> 00:28:02,229
30 seconds.

523
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:04,364
Two, pull back wide
on her entrance, please.

524
00:28:04,706 --> 00:28:07,575
Ready, two.
And take two.

525
00:28:10,378 --> 00:28:12,246
Good evening from
Washington University

526
00:28:12,588 --> 00:28:13,664
in St. Louis, Missouri.

527
00:28:14,006 --> 00:28:15,416
I'm Gwen Ifill of the News Hour

528
00:28:15,758 --> 00:28:17,626
and Washington Week on PBS.

529
00:28:17,968 --> 00:28:20,462
Welcome to the first
and the only 2008

530
00:28:20,804 --> 00:28:21,922
vice presidential debate

531
00:28:22,263 --> 00:28:23,507
between the Republican nominee

532
00:28:23,848 --> 00:28:25,634
Governor Sarah Palin of Alaska

533
00:28:25,975 --> 00:28:28,720
and the Democratic nominee,
Joe Biden of Delaware.

534
00:28:29,061 --> 00:28:31,806
Tonight's discussion will cover
a wide range of topics

535
00:28:32,148 --> 00:28:35,101
including domestic
and foreign policy matters.

536
00:28:35,442 --> 00:28:36,977
Each candidate will have 90 seconds

537
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:39,313
to respond to a direct question

538
00:28:39,654 --> 00:28:40,897
and then an additional two minutes

539
00:28:41,239 --> 00:28:42,691
for rebuttal and follow-up.

540
00:28:42,991 --> 00:28:45,902
The specific subjects and
questions were chosen by me

541
00:28:46,202 --> 00:28:48,112
and have not been shared or cleared

542
00:28:48,454 --> 00:28:50,531
with anyone on the campaigns
or on the commission.

543
00:28:51,031 --> 00:28:52,650
The audience here in the hall

544
00:28:52,791 --> 00:28:54,952
has promised to remain very polite.

545
00:28:55,294 --> 00:28:58,664
No cheers, applause,
no untoward outbursts...

546
00:28:59,005 --> 00:29:00,958
Except right at this minute

547
00:29:01,258 --> 00:29:04,461
as we welcome Governor Palin
and senator Biden.

548
00:29:12,393 --> 00:29:14,512
Nice to meet you.
Hey, can I call you Joe?

549
00:29:15,153 --> 00:29:17,306
You can call me Joe.

550
00:29:17,648 --> 00:29:18,933
Why, why is the mic on?

551
00:29:19,275 --> 00:29:21,293
No, no, no, it's cool.
They're gonna think it's some kind

552
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:24,062
of Machiavellian Jedi power-play.

553
00:29:24,604 --> 00:29:26,306
From your lips, Steve.

554
00:29:26,647 --> 00:29:27,765
Welcome to you both.

555
00:29:27,907 --> 00:29:29,984
The House of representatives
this week passed a bill,

556
00:29:30,326 --> 00:29:31,444
a big bail-out bill

557
00:29:31,786 --> 00:29:32,862
or didn't pass it, I should say.

558
00:29:33,203 --> 00:29:34,530
The senate decided to pass it

559
00:29:34,872 --> 00:29:36,407
and the house is wrestling
with it still tonight.

560
00:29:36,707 --> 00:29:39,618
Was this the worst of Washington
or the best of Washington

561
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,078
that we saw play out?

562
00:29:41,378 --> 00:29:43,246
Thank you, Gwen, and I thank
the commission also.

563
00:29:43,588 --> 00:29:45,332
I appreciate this privilege
of being able to be here

564
00:29:45,632 --> 00:29:46,750
and speak with Americans.

565
00:29:47,091 --> 00:29:49,002
Please, God, be kind.

566
00:29:49,302 --> 00:29:50,795
You know, I think a good barometer here

567
00:29:51,137 --> 00:29:53,214
when we're trying to figure out
has this been a good time

568
00:29:53,555 --> 00:29:56,759
or a bad time
in America's economy is...

569
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,886
Go to a kids' soccer game on Saturday

570
00:29:59,227 --> 00:30:01,763
and turn to any parent there
on the sideline and ask them

571
00:30:02,105 --> 00:30:03,598
"How are you feeling about the economy?"

572
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,141
And I'll betcha you're gonna hear

573
00:30:05,483 --> 00:30:07,435
some fear in that parent's voice.

574
00:30:07,777 --> 00:30:09,729
She's doing great.

575
00:30:10,371 --> 00:30:11,781
We've got 88 more minutes.

576
00:30:15,034 --> 00:30:17,986
There is something to be said
also for man's activities

577
00:30:18,328 --> 00:30:21,573
but also for the cyclical
temperature changes on our planet.

578
00:30:21,873 --> 00:30:24,492
Senator, what is true and
what is false about the causes?

579
00:30:24,792 --> 00:30:27,537
If you don't understand
what the cause is

580
00:30:27,879 --> 00:30:29,914
it's virtually impossible
to come up with a solution.

581
00:30:30,256 --> 00:30:32,792
The chant is "Drill, baby, drill."

582
00:30:33,133 --> 00:30:35,461
And that's what we hear
all across this country

583
00:30:35,803 --> 00:30:38,130
in our rallies, because people are so hungry

584
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:40,507
for those domestic sources of energy

585
00:30:40,807 --> 00:30:42,426
to be tapped into.

586
00:30:42,767 --> 00:30:44,010
We will end this war.

587
00:30:44,352 --> 00:30:45,428
For John McCain

588
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:48,431
there is no end in sight to end this war.

589
00:30:48,773 --> 00:30:50,641
We will end this war.

590
00:30:50,983 --> 00:30:52,643
Governor...

591
00:30:52,985 --> 00:30:55,980
Um... your plan...

592
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:58,315
is a white flag of surrender

593
00:30:58,657 --> 00:30:59,983
- in Iraq.
-  Whoo! Yes!

594
00:31:01,701 --> 00:31:02,986
Governor, please, did you want to respond

595
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:04,821
to Senator McCain's
comments about healthcare?

596
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:06,406
Pivot. Pivot!

597
00:31:06,748 --> 00:31:09,158
I'd like to respond about
the tax increases and...

598
00:31:09,458 --> 00:31:10,993
-  Yes!

599
00:31:11,635 --> 00:31:13,454
Darn right, we need tax relief

600
00:31:13,796 --> 00:31:15,706
for Americans so that jobs
can be created here.

601
00:31:16,048 --> 00:31:17,624
Barack Obama and Senator O'Biden

602
00:31:17,966 --> 00:31:19,543
you said no to everything...

603
00:31:19,885 --> 00:31:21,211
She just said O'Biden.

604
00:31:21,553 --> 00:31:22,754
We're probably the
only ones that heard it.

605
00:31:23,096 --> 00:31:24,839
It was Ronald Reagan who said

606
00:31:25,181 --> 00:31:27,634
that freedom is always
just one generation away

607
00:31:27,975 --> 00:31:28,885
from extinction.

608
00:31:29,827 --> 00:31:32,722
We don't pass it to our
children in the bloodstream.

609
00:31:33,363 --> 00:31:36,350
We have to fight for it
and protect it,

610
00:31:36,692 --> 00:31:37,893
and then hand it to them

611
00:31:38,235 --> 00:31:40,270
so that they will do the same.

612
00:31:40,912 --> 00:31:42,330
We will fight for it.

613
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:44,649
And there is only one man in this race

614
00:31:44,991 --> 00:31:46,818
who has really ever fought for you.

615
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,162
And that's Senator John McCain.

616
00:31:55,334 --> 00:31:56,910
Okay, here we go.

617
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:58,996
CBS instant poll says undecideds

618
00:31:59,337 --> 00:32:02,874
give the debate to Biden 46%, Palin, 21.

619
00:32:03,174 --> 00:32:05,085
Fuck CBS and fuck their instant poll.

620
00:32:05,426 --> 00:32:06,669
This is the greatest debate victory

621
00:32:07,011 --> 00:32:08,004
in the history of the republic.

622
00:32:08,346 --> 00:32:09,922
Okay!

623
00:32:15,185 --> 00:32:18,472
You see? You just had to be you.

624
00:32:20,524 --> 00:32:21,975
I'm gonna grab a beer.

625
00:32:22,675 --> 00:32:24,594
- Want one?
- No.

626
00:32:25,536 --> 00:32:28,306
Senator McCain wanted me to congratulate you

627
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:29,816
on a fantastic debate.

628
00:32:29,957 --> 00:32:32,368
- You really did a great job.
- Thanks.

629
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:36,155
Tell John I want to bring up
Bill Ayers and Reverend Wright.

630
00:32:36,497 --> 00:32:38,407
I think it's time to go for the jugular.

631
00:32:39,149 --> 00:32:42,060
Uh, you'll have to discuss
that with your running mate.

632
00:32:42,202 --> 00:32:44,871
He made it very clear that he
doesn't want to touch Wright.

633
00:32:45,471 --> 00:32:47,207
I'll talk to him about it.

634
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,083
We have to win this thing.

635
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:51,461
I so don't want to go back to Alaska.

636
00:32:58,249 --> 00:32:59,843
Stevie.

637
00:33:00,185 --> 00:33:02,512
You know, I think the worst
of this thing might be over.

638
00:33:02,854 --> 00:33:03,889
All she's got left are speeches.

639
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:06,349
There's no more debates,
no major interviews.

640
00:33:06,691 --> 00:33:09,143
Yeah. We're doing great.

641
00:33:11,862 --> 00:33:14,940
This was an unbelievable win for Sarah Palin.

642
00:33:15,282 --> 00:33:19,069
In fact, I think that
it unveiled a level of skill

643
00:33:19,411 --> 00:33:21,822
in communication that
I really have not seen

644
00:33:22,163 --> 00:33:23,740
since Ronald Reagan.

645
00:33:24,082 --> 00:33:25,825
She is a superstar.

646
00:33:26,125 --> 00:33:27,452
Her ability to by...

647
00:33:27,794 --> 00:33:29,370
And she sure is a breath of fresh air.

648
00:33:29,712 --> 00:33:30,747
I mean, I think people want

649
00:33:31,088 --> 00:33:32,206
someone from outside of Washington.

650
00:33:32,548 --> 00:33:33,708
She sounded like the future.

651
00:33:34,049 --> 00:33:35,084
Oh, come on, honey.

652
00:33:35,426 --> 00:33:36,502
Why don't you get some sleep?

653
00:33:36,843 --> 00:33:38,295
One sec, okay?

654
00:33:38,637 --> 00:33:40,297
...Turned around.
I think she has done it

655
00:33:40,639 --> 00:33:43,133
in the sense that of the
four debaters we've seen,

656
00:33:43,475 --> 00:33:46,136
she was the most interesting,
attractive of them all.

657
00:33:46,477 --> 00:33:48,721
- She is personable...
- I can still win this thing.

658
00:33:49,063 --> 00:33:50,223
She's got a sense of humor.

659
00:33:57,529 --> 00:34:00,107
This map is now lopsided
in favor of Barack Obama.

660
00:34:00,448 --> 00:34:01,733
John McCain pulling out of Michigan.

661
00:34:02,033 --> 00:34:03,985
The first domino
in an economic debate

662
00:34:04,285 --> 00:34:06,154
that if John McCain
does not turn around soon,

663
00:34:06,496 --> 00:34:07,780
many see more blue on this map

664
00:34:08,122 --> 00:34:09,282
and more trouble for John McCain.

665
00:34:09,624 --> 00:34:10,908
Yesterday, it was
announced that the campaign

666
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:12,702
is going to leave Michigan
to Obama to win.

667
00:34:13,002 --> 00:34:14,829
- What's going on there?
- I read that this morning also,

668
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:16,247
and I fired off a quick e-mail

669
00:34:16,588 --> 00:34:18,123
and I said, "Oh, come on! Do we have to?"

670
00:34:18,465 --> 00:34:19,791
Do we have to call it there?

671
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:22,502
I want to go back to Michigan,
and I want to try.

672
00:34:22,844 --> 00:34:24,379
What the fuck?

673
00:34:24,721 --> 00:34:26,089
McCain had hoped to
just score a pick-up.

674
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:28,424
We made the decision to pull
the ads out of Michigan

675
00:34:28,766 --> 00:34:29,842
because we can't win there.

676
00:34:30,184 --> 00:34:31,177
We need the money in Pennsylvania

677
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:34,346
- and Ohio.
- You're making a big mistake.

678
00:34:34,688 --> 00:34:36,432
You know, I know I'm not
an expert like yourself,

679
00:34:37,073 --> 00:34:38,851
but seeing as we're seven points out,

680
00:34:39,192 --> 00:34:40,852
I don't see why
the vice presidential campaign

681
00:34:41,194 --> 00:34:42,312
can't make a quick stop there

682
00:34:42,654 --> 00:34:43,688
in the middle of the night.

683
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:44,981
And who are you gonna meet with?

684
00:34:45,323 --> 00:34:46,441
Your press corps doesn't want

685
00:34:46,783 --> 00:34:48,693
to hear you speak at 3:00 in the morning.

686
00:34:49,035 --> 00:34:51,487
And there's no such thing as
a vice presidential campaign.

687
00:34:51,829 --> 00:34:53,364
This is John McCain's campaign,

688
00:34:53,664 --> 00:34:56,075
and this is the decision
that John McCain has made.

689
00:34:56,375 --> 00:34:58,786
You must stick to the script, Governor.

690
00:34:59,127 --> 00:35:01,496
And what script is that, Steve?

691
00:35:01,796 --> 00:35:02,956
'Cause I haven't seen anything resembling

692
00:35:03,298 --> 00:35:07,168
a script this entire flippin' campaign.

693
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:09,545
When you publicly
contradict John McCain,

694
00:35:09,887 --> 00:35:11,088
you hurt John McCain.

695
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:14,383
I know what I know what I know.

696
00:35:18,353 --> 00:35:19,805
And there you have it.

697
00:35:22,715 --> 00:35:24,059
Afternoon, governor.

698
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,286
This is a pro-stem cell ad?

699
00:35:26,486 --> 00:35:28,479
Yes, Governor.
That's the Senator's position.

700
00:35:28,779 --> 00:35:31,232
Yeah, it's not my position.
I'm not saying it.

701
00:35:31,774 --> 00:35:32,567
I thought that--

702
00:35:32,867 --> 00:35:34,819
You guys should have shown
me the script ahead of time.

703
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,271
This is a waste of my time.

704
00:35:40,457 --> 00:35:41,908
Why wasn't I informed that Jeb Bradley

705
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:43,451
is appearing with me at the rally?

706
00:35:43,793 --> 00:35:45,203
I don't think we foresaw
that being a problem.

707
00:35:45,545 --> 00:35:47,705
I just Googled him. He's pro-choice.

708
00:35:48,347 --> 00:35:52,460
There's no way I'm going onstage
with anyone who's pro-choice.

709
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,962
Bradley's gone or I'm gone, period.

710
00:35:55,304 --> 00:35:56,213
Yes, Governor.

711
00:35:56,555 --> 00:35:59,883
The RNC spent a stunning $150,000

712
00:36:00,225 --> 00:36:02,719
on clothes for Governor
Sarah Palin and her family

713
00:36:03,061 --> 00:36:05,305
according to the federal
election commission reports.

714
00:36:05,647 --> 00:36:07,223
The revelation that so much money

715
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:09,058
was spent at fancy clothing stores

716
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,227
like Neiman Marcus
and Saks Fifth Avenue

717
00:36:11,527 --> 00:36:13,396
could be a huge blow
to the governor's image

718
00:36:13,737 --> 00:36:15,856
as an everyday, average American.

719
00:36:16,498 --> 00:36:17,750
Several Republican donors

720
00:36:17,991 --> 00:36:19,443
have publicly expressed outrage...

721
00:36:19,785 --> 00:36:22,112
- You watching this?
-  Yeah, I'm watching.

722
00:36:22,412 --> 00:36:23,613
Un-fucking-believable.

723
00:36:23,955 --> 00:36:25,365
Why didn't you people tell me

724
00:36:25,707 --> 00:36:26,874
these clothes cost this much?

725
00:36:26,916 --> 00:36:28,284
It wasn't just
your clothes, Governor.

726
00:36:28,626 --> 00:36:30,745
It was also for the kids,
Todd and your parents.

727
00:36:31,087 --> 00:36:32,330
I want 'em gone.

728
00:36:32,671 --> 00:36:34,457
Get 'em out of here.

729
00:36:34,798 --> 00:36:37,293
You know, I buy my clothes
at consignment shops.

730
00:36:37,634 --> 00:36:40,837
I never wanted this fancy crap
in the first place.

731
00:36:41,137 --> 00:36:42,464
Hey, thanks for coming out.

732
00:36:42,806 --> 00:36:44,299
Hey. Hi, nice to meet you.

733
00:36:44,641 --> 00:36:46,760
- How are you? Hey, hi.
-  Governor Palin,

734
00:36:47,101 --> 00:36:48,261
What's your response to the findings

735
00:36:48,603 --> 00:36:49,887
that the Alaska state
legislature's report

736
00:36:50,187 --> 00:36:51,556
on your involvement
in the troopergate scandal?

737
00:36:51,897 --> 00:36:53,683
I was thrilled to be
cleared of all wrongdoing.

738
00:36:54,424 --> 00:36:55,709
You know you're not
supposed to be here.

739
00:36:55,809 --> 00:36:58,011
Go back to the press risers, please.
Thank you.

740
00:36:58,153 --> 00:37:00,564
You can't say you were
cleared of all wrongdoing.

741
00:37:00,906 --> 00:37:02,649
- Why not?
- Because you weren't.

742
00:37:02,949 --> 00:37:05,402
The report stated that
you abused your power.

743
00:37:05,743 --> 00:37:07,946
That is the opposite of being
cleared of all wrongdoing.

744
00:37:08,287 --> 00:37:10,323
- Then why was I told otherwise?
- You weren't told otherwise.

745
00:37:10,664 --> 00:37:11,657
And why haven't you
released a statement

746
00:37:11,957 --> 00:37:13,075
saying that Todd
was never a member

747
00:37:13,417 --> 00:37:14,326
of the Alaska Independence Party?

748
00:37:14,668 --> 00:37:17,496
Because that would be untrue.
He was a member.

749
00:37:17,838 --> 00:37:19,248
He checked the wrong box.

750
00:37:19,589 --> 00:37:20,749
He registered by accident,

751
00:37:21,091 --> 00:37:22,709
and rectified the error immediately.

752
00:37:23,051 --> 00:37:24,461
He was a member for seven years!

753
00:37:24,802 --> 00:37:26,838
I'm sorry, Governor, but...

754
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,840
There is only a few weeks
left in this campaign.

755
00:37:29,181 --> 00:37:30,925
You have got to stop
saying things to the press

756
00:37:31,267 --> 00:37:32,260
that are blatantly untrue.

757
00:37:32,601 --> 00:37:34,804
That is not the kind of campaign
that we are running here.

758
00:37:35,145 --> 00:37:37,890
"Campaign." Is that what
you're calling this now?

759
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:40,934
Governor, I admit that this
is a dysfunctional campaign

760
00:37:41,276 --> 00:37:42,352
but that is what I inherited

761
00:37:42,652 --> 00:37:45,188
and I am doing my level best
to help us win this election.

762
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:46,689
And that's what I'm trying to do, too

763
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:48,233
and all you're doing is screwing me up.

764
00:37:48,574 --> 00:37:51,027
That's all you've done this
entire time, is get in my way.

765
00:37:53,454 --> 00:37:55,990
And I am raising millions of
dollars for this campaign.

766
00:37:56,331 --> 00:37:57,741
Hundreds of thousands
of people are coming

767
00:37:58,083 --> 00:37:59,701
to see me speak, not John
McCain, God bless him.

768
00:38:00,043 --> 00:38:01,036
They are coming to see me.

769
00:38:01,378 --> 00:38:05,165
So if I am single-handedly
carrying this campaign

770
00:38:05,506 --> 00:38:07,333
I'm gonna do what I want.

771
00:38:28,168 --> 00:38:30,646
Several McCain advisors
tell CNN they're annoyed

772
00:38:30,988 --> 00:38:33,733
by what one aide called
"Palin going rogue."

773
00:38:34,074 --> 00:38:35,818
God damn it.

774
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,528
I hate it when there's
leaking and backstabbing

775
00:38:37,828 --> 00:38:40,572
after a campaign, let alone
before it's fucking over.

776
00:38:40,914 --> 00:38:43,450
I need you to step in
and talk to her.

777
00:38:44,292 --> 00:38:46,619
I don't know, Stevie boy.
I don't know.

778
00:38:47,861 --> 00:38:49,330
Sir...

779
00:38:49,872 --> 00:38:51,624
I can't control her any more.

780
00:38:54,802 --> 00:38:56,670
I don't know if she's
getting on a campaign plane

781
00:38:57,012 --> 00:38:58,714
in the morning or what
she's gonna say at night.

782
00:38:59,056 --> 00:39:01,591
We need to finish this campaign

783
00:39:01,933 --> 00:39:03,468
with as much dignity as possible,

784
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:05,136
and the only way that can happen

785
00:39:05,478 --> 00:39:06,971
is if you get her in line.

786
00:39:10,391 --> 00:39:12,034
That's not gonna do it, Steve.

787
00:39:12,276 --> 00:39:14,478
She might start turning on me.

788
00:39:26,247 --> 00:39:28,116
Most of these polls have us trailing

789
00:39:28,457 --> 00:39:30,076
5 to 8 points.

790
00:39:30,376 --> 00:39:32,328
- So what now?
- John...

791
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:34,288
I mean, these numbers do show it.

792
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:36,874
We've got to make this about Obama.

793
00:39:37,215 --> 00:39:38,375
We've got to get tough

794
00:39:38,717 --> 00:39:40,210
and we've got to get negative.

795
00:39:40,552 --> 00:39:42,170
If we go this way,

796
00:39:42,512 --> 00:39:45,924
Reverend Wright is still
the best play we have.

797
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:49,844
Any of you ever been accused

798
00:39:50,186 --> 00:39:54,056
of having a negro child out of wedlock

799
00:39:54,398 --> 00:39:57,601
because your adopted daughter
was born in Bangladesh?

800
00:39:58,777 --> 00:40:00,062
And then when she was 16

801
00:40:00,403 --> 00:40:03,273
and Googled her name,
I had to explain to her

802
00:40:03,573 --> 00:40:06,818
why President Bush's henchmen
called her a bastard

803
00:40:07,118 --> 00:40:09,278
when she was 10 years old.

804
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:12,406
Yeah, listen, South Carolina,
that was an ugly primary

805
00:40:12,748 --> 00:40:13,908
but this isn't the same thing.

806
00:40:14,249 --> 00:40:16,285
I mean, Reverend Wright
really did say those things.

807
00:40:16,627 --> 00:40:18,704
That may be true.

808
00:40:19,046 --> 00:40:22,082
But there is a dark side
to American populism.

809
00:40:22,424 --> 00:40:25,293
Some people win elections
by tapping into it.

810
00:40:27,261 --> 00:40:29,630
I'm not one of those people.

811
00:40:30,972 --> 00:40:33,843
Okay. So what about Bill Ayers?

812
00:40:34,143 --> 00:40:35,761
Obama began his career

813
00:40:36,061 --> 00:40:37,846
in the living roomof a domestic terrorist.

814
00:40:38,188 --> 00:40:41,475
Domestic terrorist. Nothing to do with race.

815
00:40:46,821 --> 00:40:48,815
Yeah, okay.

816
00:40:49,156 --> 00:40:51,150
Ayers is fair.

817
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:53,569
Okay. Who should do this?

818
00:40:53,911 --> 00:40:56,113
And Barack held one of the first meetings

819
00:40:56,455 --> 00:41:00,033
of his political career in Bill Ayers' living room.

820
00:41:02,502 --> 00:41:04,996
Pallin' around with terrorists.

821
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:08,333
He's not a Christian!

822
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:10,918
And I am just so fearful

823
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,212
that this is not a man

824
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:15,714
who sees America

825
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:20,135
- the way that you and I see America.
-  He's a socialist!

826
00:41:20,477 --> 00:41:25,932
As the greatest source
for good in this world.

827
00:41:28,901 --> 00:41:30,853
USA! USA!

828
00:41:34,022 --> 00:41:36,275
What does Barack
Obama plan for America?

829
00:41:36,617 --> 00:41:38,402
Nothing!

830
00:41:39,644 --> 00:41:41,780
In short, who is
the real Barack Obama?

831
00:41:42,322 --> 00:41:44,524
A terrorist!

832
00:41:45,124 --> 00:41:46,576
We believe that the best of America

833
00:41:46,918 --> 00:41:49,996
is not all in Washington, D.C.

834
00:41:54,949 --> 00:41:56,877
We believe that the best of America

835
00:41:57,219 --> 00:41:59,796
is in these small towns that we get to visit

836
00:42:00,138 --> 00:42:02,132
and in these wonderful little pockets

837
00:42:02,474 --> 00:42:04,384
of what I call the real America.

838
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:18,664
For a man who's written two memoirs

839
00:42:18,864 --> 00:42:19,982
he's no open book.

840
00:42:20,323 --> 00:42:22,442
You got that right.

841
00:42:22,742 --> 00:42:24,861
What does Barack Obama
see for America?

842
00:42:25,461 --> 00:42:26,479
He's a Muslim!

843
00:42:26,621 --> 00:42:27,780
He's a socialist!

844
00:42:28,122 --> 00:42:30,074
- He doesn't represent us!
-  He doesn't belong here!

845
00:42:30,416 --> 00:42:32,326
He hangs out with people
who hate our country.

846
00:42:32,668 --> 00:42:35,079
-  He's not American!
-  Kill him!

847
00:42:35,421 --> 00:42:38,540
Send him back to Africa!

848
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,292
Let me read to you, Tara,

849
00:42:40,634 --> 00:42:43,086
what congressman John Lewis,
the civil rights icon,

850
00:42:43,386 --> 00:42:45,422
said on Saturday in a statement.

851
00:42:45,763 --> 00:42:47,924
He said, "as one who was
a victim of violence"

852
00:42:48,266 --> 00:42:50,093
and hate during the height
of the civil rights movement,

853
00:42:50,434 --> 00:42:52,136
I am deeply disturbed
by the negative tone

854
00:42:52,436 --> 00:42:54,055
of the McCain-Palin campaign.

855
00:42:54,396 --> 00:42:56,015
Senator McCain and Governor Palin"...

856
00:42:56,315 --> 00:42:57,725
We gotta tone the rhetoric down.

857
00:42:58,066 --> 00:42:59,601
It's gotten out of control.

858
00:43:00,243 --> 00:43:03,146
We can't even mention
Obama's name any more.

859
00:43:03,446 --> 00:43:05,065
The crowd gets too hot.

860
00:43:08,201 --> 00:43:10,862
This isn't the campaign I wanted to run.

861
00:43:12,538 --> 00:43:14,448
I can't trust Obama.

862
00:43:14,748 --> 00:43:16,617
I've read about him, and he's not a--

863
00:43:16,959 --> 00:43:18,952
he's a... He's an Arab.

864
00:43:19,294 --> 00:43:20,495
He's not an Amer--

865
00:43:20,837 --> 00:43:22,789
no, ma'am.

866
00:43:23,131 --> 00:43:24,165
No, ma'am.

867
00:43:24,507 --> 00:43:27,127
He's a decent family-man citizen

868
00:43:27,468 --> 00:43:29,212
who I just happen to have
disagreements with

869
00:43:29,553 --> 00:43:31,464
on certain fundamental issues.

870
00:43:31,764 --> 00:43:34,467
And that's what this
campaign is all about.

871
00:43:34,808 --> 00:43:37,136
He's not. Thank you.

872
00:43:38,887 --> 00:43:40,088
Cutting through the bull tonight,

873
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:41,348
on the Eve of the election,

874
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:43,975
the campaigns are relying
on their lucky charms.

875
00:43:44,275 --> 00:43:47,312
- Vodka rocks, lime.
-  You got it.

876
00:43:47,853 --> 00:43:48,971
How's he doing?

877
00:43:49,113 --> 00:43:52,108
He's the most depressed I've
seen him the entire campaign.

878
00:43:52,408 --> 00:43:55,110
I can't get him to stop watching MSNBC

879
00:43:55,452 --> 00:43:57,363
which only makes him more miserable.

880
00:43:58,955 --> 00:44:02,325
I'm amazed that someone
who has been in politics

881
00:44:02,625 --> 00:44:04,953
this long takes
all the petty stuff

882
00:44:05,295 --> 00:44:06,413
so personally.

883
00:44:06,754 --> 00:44:09,082
And that's why they are who they are.

884
00:44:09,382 --> 00:44:10,833
Reagan, Bush, Clinton--

885
00:44:11,175 --> 00:44:13,085
all they want is to be loved.

886
00:44:13,427 --> 00:44:15,671
The ones that don't
pathologically need to be loved,

887
00:44:16,013 --> 00:44:17,298
they don't get the nomination.

888
00:44:17,598 --> 00:44:18,841
They don't get to be president.

889
00:44:19,182 --> 00:44:20,342
If you'd understood that fact

890
00:44:20,684 --> 00:44:23,136
you might have been able to better
handle our Alaskan moose hunter.

891
00:44:25,021 --> 00:44:27,307
God, it was a tough campaign.

892
00:44:27,648 --> 00:44:30,226
It wasn't a campaign,
it was a bad reality show.

893
00:44:30,968 --> 00:44:32,311
She didn't cost us the election.

894
00:44:32,653 --> 00:44:35,147
That was Bush. That was the economy.

895
00:44:35,447 --> 00:44:37,358
That was just the cold hand of fate.

896
00:44:37,699 --> 00:44:39,401
We didn't have a chance.

897
00:44:39,701 --> 00:44:41,111
And if we did win,

898
00:44:41,411 --> 00:44:44,614
would you feel comfortable
with president Palin?

899
00:44:44,956 --> 00:44:46,449
Why not? Then we would have won.

900
00:44:48,584 --> 00:44:49,577
Come on, guys, listen.

901
00:44:49,919 --> 00:44:52,038
I, too, wish that
the American people

902
00:44:52,379 --> 00:44:54,165
would choose the future Abraham Lincoln

903
00:44:54,506 --> 00:44:56,458
or Thomas Jefferson, but unfortunately,

904
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,168
that's not the way it works any more.

905
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:01,171
Now it takes movie star charisma

906
00:45:01,513 --> 00:45:03,131
to get elected president.

907
00:45:03,473 --> 00:45:06,968
And Obama and Palin, that's
what they are. They're stars.

908
00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:08,761
Primary difference being

909
00:45:09,103 --> 00:45:11,681
Sarah Palin can't name
a Supreme Court decision

910
00:45:12,022 --> 00:45:13,808
whereas Barack Obama

911
00:45:14,108 --> 00:45:15,768
was a constitutional law professor.

912
00:45:16,668 --> 00:45:17,694
Fuck you.

913
00:45:22,449 --> 00:45:23,650
You know what Dick Cheney said

914
00:45:23,992 --> 00:45:25,944
- when he found out we picked her?
- What?

915
00:45:26,285 --> 00:45:29,155
He said we made a reckless choice.

916
00:45:30,555 --> 00:45:33,326
When you lose the moral
high ground to Dick Cheney,

917
00:45:33,667 --> 00:45:35,953
it's time to re-think your entire life.

918
00:45:36,295 --> 00:45:37,830
Enough Cheney cracks, okay?

919
00:45:38,171 --> 00:45:40,165
I mean, he's very misunderstood.

920
00:45:40,465 --> 00:45:41,583
How does he eat when he's wearing

921
00:45:41,925 --> 00:45:43,418
Darth Vader's helmet, anyway?

922
00:45:45,094 --> 00:45:46,129
There we go.

923
00:45:46,471 --> 00:45:48,590
Gentlemen, let's wish each other good luck.

924
00:45:48,931 --> 00:45:50,716
Who knows, we could have another

925
00:45:51,058 --> 00:45:52,593
Dewey-Truman situation here.

926
00:45:52,935 --> 00:45:54,220
Always room for an upset.

927
00:45:54,561 --> 00:45:57,014
Yeah, maybe I'll wake up
with a full head of hair.

928
00:46:00,859 --> 00:46:03,061
You know, if we had just
asked for policy questions

929
00:46:03,403 --> 00:46:05,855
in the briefing, then we would have known.

930
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:08,616
I thought Culvahouse was gonna
grill her during the vet.

931
00:46:08,958 --> 00:46:11,160
Culvahouse thought
we were gonna grill her.

932
00:46:12,453 --> 00:46:14,447
It haunts me.

933
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:20,444
After a hard-fought battle,

934
00:46:20,644 --> 00:46:23,121
the nation's longest-running
presidential race

935
00:46:23,421 --> 00:46:25,623
comes down to this day. Election day.

936
00:46:26,265 --> 00:46:29,127
Voting is now underway
in all the lower 48 states

937
00:46:29,427 --> 00:46:31,504
as we approach the end
of this historic election.

938
00:46:32,146 --> 00:46:35,439
People lined up across the country
by the millions today.

939
00:46:35,849 --> 00:46:38,085
Turnout looks to be
the highest in decades.

940
00:46:38,226 --> 00:46:41,513
John McCain will carry Kentucky
once again, as expected.

941
00:46:42,213 --> 00:46:44,724
8 electoral votes, not a huge surprise.

942
00:46:45,066 --> 00:46:47,101
We are not able to make a projection

943
00:46:47,401 --> 00:46:49,062
in the 4 other states...

944
00:46:49,403 --> 00:46:51,272
...that are closing all their polls

945
00:46:51,614 --> 00:46:52,940
at this hour right now.

946
00:46:53,282 --> 00:46:54,942
and some of them are battleground states.

947
00:46:55,284 --> 00:46:58,112
Georgia, Indiana,
South Carolina and Virginia.

948
00:46:58,453 --> 00:47:01,156
It doesn't necessarily mean that
it's gonna be close or not...

949
00:47:03,498 --> 00:47:04,442
Where's Virginia?

950
00:47:04,742 --> 00:47:08,196
Negative five. And Ohio's gone.

951
00:47:08,337 --> 00:47:09,831
- Got it.
- I'll keep you posted.

952
00:47:10,172 --> 00:47:11,466
Call you in 10.

953
00:47:13,308 --> 00:47:14,468
What's going on?

954
00:47:14,810 --> 00:47:16,887
We're gonna lose Pennsylvania.

955
00:47:17,029 --> 00:47:18,689
And Ohio.

956
00:47:20,765 --> 00:47:22,092
Steve...

957
00:47:23,334 --> 00:47:25,929
There's something I have to tell you.

958
00:47:26,429 --> 00:47:27,965
What's wrong?

959
00:47:29,106 --> 00:47:30,767
I didn't vote.

960
00:47:31,408 --> 00:47:33,485
I couldn't do it.

961
00:47:33,827 --> 00:47:35,488
I didn't vote.

962
00:47:38,824 --> 00:47:39,942
I couldn't do it.

963
00:47:40,483 --> 00:47:42,060
It's okay.

964
00:47:43,145 --> 00:47:44,847
We'll take you right to the voter analysis...

965
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:49,325
How we doing, Stevie boy?

966
00:47:52,878 --> 00:47:55,456
We lost Pennsylvania and Ohio, sir.

967
00:48:13,564 --> 00:48:15,975
When my grandfather

968
00:48:16,316 --> 00:48:20,604
found out that the Japanese had surrendered

969
00:48:21,346 --> 00:48:22,614
he was lost.

970
00:48:22,655 --> 00:48:25,650
He didn't know what to do with himself.

971
00:48:25,950 --> 00:48:28,152
He came home

972
00:48:28,494 --> 00:48:30,571
dropped dead the very next day.

973
00:48:33,457 --> 00:48:36,785
Fought his war, then he died.

974
00:48:38,503 --> 00:48:39,872
And my dad,

975
00:48:40,613 --> 00:48:43,458
when he retired from the Navy,

976
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,877
he fell into a sense of despair

977
00:48:46,219 --> 00:48:48,171
for the rest of his life.

978
00:48:54,977 --> 00:48:57,179
I'm never gonna quit, Steve.

979
00:48:58,855 --> 00:49:00,182
I can't.

980
00:49:03,776 --> 00:49:05,353
I don't know how to just fade away.

981
00:49:09,073 --> 00:49:10,650
Senator, I--

982
00:49:10,991 --> 00:49:12,610
I just want to say--

983
00:49:18,999 --> 00:49:20,534
What?

984
00:49:23,128 --> 00:49:25,121
I'm s-- I'm s--

985
00:49:25,463 --> 00:49:27,415
I'm so sorry that I...

986
00:49:28,633 --> 00:49:30,877
Suggested her.

987
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:34,839
Don't be.

988
00:49:36,557 --> 00:49:37,883
Fuck 'em.

989
00:49:39,684 --> 00:49:42,095
What were we supposed to do?

990
00:49:43,237 --> 00:49:45,231
A truly historic night here in the United States.

991
00:49:45,573 --> 00:49:46,566
Barack Obama will become

992
00:49:46,607 --> 00:49:48,393
the 44th president of the United States.

993
00:49:49,134 --> 00:49:50,511
Sorry, Mom.

994
00:49:50,611 --> 00:49:52,104
Oh, thanks, kiddo.

995
00:49:53,104 --> 00:49:54,832
I'm really sorry, Mom.

996
00:49:55,074 --> 00:49:56,400
Sweetheart.

997
00:49:57,042 --> 00:49:58,819
You did great. You know that, right?

998
00:50:00,837 --> 00:50:02,205
Come here, baby.

999
00:50:02,547 --> 00:50:05,583
It's all right. We're okay. Yeah.

1000
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:10,671
I'll take the stress
very literally here.

1001
00:50:10,713 --> 00:50:12,498
Just one quick-- you think?

1002
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:15,292
And on this next part, would
you make sure you bold that?

1003
00:50:15,634 --> 00:50:18,337
Oh, Chris, I need you to load
this in the teleprompter for me.

1004
00:50:18,678 --> 00:50:20,247
Steve Schmidt told me
you weren't making a speech.

1005
00:50:20,888 --> 00:50:23,775
No. I am making a speech.

1006
00:50:23,975 --> 00:50:25,176
Scully cleared it with Rick Davis.

1007
00:50:25,518 --> 00:50:26,970
So just go ahead and load it, okay?

1008
00:50:27,811 --> 00:50:28,846
Okay.

1009
00:50:31,857 --> 00:50:35,728
Okay, so, on the stress
on this one, I'll take it.

1010
00:50:36,469 --> 00:50:37,813
- Jesus!
- Hey, sorry.

1011
00:50:38,155 --> 00:50:39,857
Steve, I'm getting a bunch
of mixed messages here.

1012
00:50:40,198 --> 00:50:41,817
Is the governor giving
a concession speech or not?

1013
00:50:42,158 --> 00:50:44,319
I've already said this
five times already.

1014
00:50:44,661 --> 00:50:46,029
She is not giving a speech.

1015
00:50:46,371 --> 00:50:47,614
Well, she seems to think otherwise.

1016
00:50:47,955 --> 00:50:49,574
Well, she's not.

1017
00:50:49,874 --> 00:50:51,075
What do you want me to tell her?

1018
00:50:51,417 --> 00:50:53,744
Tell her she's not fucking speaking!

1019
00:50:54,086 --> 00:50:55,412
Okay, well, you both seem pretty certain

1020
00:50:55,754 --> 00:50:58,040
Well, let my certainty
supersede her certainty.

1021
00:50:58,682 --> 00:50:59,841
Goddamn it!

1022
00:51:04,137 --> 00:51:05,338
Steve.

1023
00:51:05,638 --> 00:51:07,257
You want to see me?

1024
00:51:07,598 --> 00:51:09,050
Yes. This way.

1025
00:51:16,857 --> 00:51:18,684
Excuse us a moment.

1026
00:51:26,032 --> 00:51:28,776
I understand you've prepared a speech.
Is that correct?

1027
00:51:29,376 --> 00:51:30,862
Yes, I have.
I want to salute John

1028
00:51:31,203 --> 00:51:32,780
for everything he's done
for this country.

1029
00:51:33,422 --> 00:51:36,492
It's not going to happen.
You're not giving a speech.

1030
00:51:36,833 --> 00:51:38,202
And why is that, Steve?

1031
00:51:38,543 --> 00:51:39,536
You're not giving a speech

1032
00:51:39,878 --> 00:51:41,455
because the vice presidential candidate

1033
00:51:41,755 --> 00:51:45,250
has never given a concession
speech on election night.

1034
00:51:45,591 --> 00:51:47,043
It's not about you.

1035
00:51:47,385 --> 00:51:49,337
It's about the country.

1036
00:51:49,637 --> 00:51:52,173
Yeah, well, there's a lot of
things never been done before.

1037
00:51:54,433 --> 00:51:55,676
Governor...

1038
00:51:56,018 --> 00:51:57,428
This country has just elected

1039
00:51:57,728 --> 00:51:59,846
the first African-
American president

1040
00:52:00,188 --> 00:52:01,682
in the history of its existence.

1041
00:52:02,023 --> 00:52:03,558
And it is the concession speech

1042
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:05,226
that will legitimize his succession

1043
00:52:05,568 --> 00:52:07,270
as commander in chief.

1044
00:52:07,612 --> 00:52:09,689
It is a serious and solemn occasion

1045
00:52:10,031 --> 00:52:12,066
and John McCain, and only John McCain

1046
00:52:12,408 --> 00:52:14,944
will be giving this sacred speech.

1047
00:52:15,485 --> 00:52:16,645
This is how it has been done

1048
00:52:16,787 --> 00:52:18,322
in every presidential election

1049
00:52:18,663 --> 00:52:20,073
since the dawn of the republic

1050
00:52:20,415 --> 00:52:21,825
and you, Sarah Palin,

1051
00:52:22,167 --> 00:52:23,660
will not change the importance

1052
00:52:24,002 --> 00:52:27,539
of this proud American tradition.

1053
00:52:39,341 --> 00:52:42,344
We fought, we fought as hard as we could.

1054
00:52:42,685 --> 00:52:43,970
And though we feel short,

1055
00:52:44,270 --> 00:52:46,056
the fail, the failure is mine.

1056
00:52:47,197 --> 00:52:48,341
Oh, jeez, no..

1057
00:52:48,741 --> 00:52:50,109
I don't feel that short, Mark.

1058
00:52:50,809 --> 00:52:51,994
"Fell short," boss.

1059
00:52:52,236 --> 00:52:54,355
- Yeah, thanks.
- "Fell short." It's a typo.

1060
00:52:55,555 --> 00:52:58,267
- John.
- Hi, Sarah.

1061
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:02,896
Well, we fought the good fight.

1062
00:53:03,037 --> 00:53:05,240
Mm-hmm, we did.

1063
00:53:05,781 --> 00:53:08,451
Now I'm just gonna get out
there and thank America.

1064
00:53:08,751 --> 00:53:10,870
I can't wait to get
out there and thank you.

1065
00:53:11,212 --> 00:53:14,623
I have a speech written
that is a real tribute to ya.

1066
00:53:15,565 --> 00:53:18,419
No, I think these guys
have that covered.

1067
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:19,911
Right, Steve?

1068
00:53:20,011 --> 00:53:21,129
Yes, sir. We have it covered.

1069
00:53:22,371 --> 00:53:24,332
I just wanted people to know
what a great man you are.

1070
00:53:24,774 --> 00:53:26,017
I appreciate that,

1071
00:53:26,159 --> 00:53:28,027
but these guys got it all worked out.

1072
00:53:28,469 --> 00:53:31,806
Yeah, you know, we probably
should get going now, sir, so...

1073
00:53:32,106 --> 00:53:33,432
All right. Good.

1074
00:53:35,943 --> 00:53:38,771
- Okay. We'll see you afterwards.
- I'll see you out there.

1075
00:53:50,631 --> 00:53:53,534
You're one of the leaders
of the party now, Sarah.

1076
00:53:54,376 --> 00:53:57,988
Don't get co-opted by Limbaugh
and the other extremists.

1077
00:53:58,230 --> 00:54:00,932
They'll destroy the party if you let them.

1078
00:54:02,133 --> 00:54:03,919
Remember, you're a hockey mom.

1079
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:05,962
You just wanted
to make a difference,

1080
00:54:06,304 --> 00:54:07,839
and you did.

1081
00:54:08,181 --> 00:54:09,173
A big, huge difference.

1082
00:54:09,915 --> 00:54:11,992
I'll always be grateful.
Thank you.

1083
00:54:12,234 --> 00:54:13,936
- We should go, sir.
- Thank you, John.

1084
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:27,732
My friends, we have

1085
00:54:28,074 --> 00:54:29,984
We have come to the end
of a long journey.

1086
00:54:32,578 --> 00:54:34,905
The American people have spoken,

1087
00:54:35,247 --> 00:54:37,199
and they have spoken clearly.

1088
00:54:37,641 --> 00:54:39,134
A little while ago,
I had the honor

1089
00:54:39,376 --> 00:54:41,078
of calling Senator Barack Obama...

1090
00:54:42,119 --> 00:54:43,279
To congrat--

1091
00:54:43,379 --> 00:54:45,081
Please.

1092
00:54:45,381 --> 00:54:47,000
To congratulate him on being elected

1093
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:49,293
the next president
of the country we both love.

1094
00:54:54,147 --> 00:54:56,634
Whatever our differences,

1095
00:54:56,934 --> 00:54:58,719
we are fellow Americans.

1096
00:55:02,438 --> 00:55:04,549
I am so deeply grateful to all of you

1097
00:55:04,991 --> 00:55:06,509
for the great honor of your support

1098
00:55:06,851 --> 00:55:08,386
and all you have done for me.

1099
00:55:10,738 --> 00:55:12,189
I am also, of course,

1100
00:55:12,531 --> 00:55:14,900
very thankful to Governor Sarah Palin,

1101
00:55:15,242 --> 00:55:17,528
one of the best campaigners I have ever seen.

1102
00:55:22,465 --> 00:55:24,234
Still think she's fit for office?

1103
00:55:24,334 --> 00:55:25,460
Eh, who cares?

1104
00:55:25,501 --> 00:55:27,328
In 48 hours, no one will
even remember who she is.

1105
00:55:28,028 --> 00:55:29,864
We can all look forward
with great interest

1106
00:55:30,006 --> 00:55:31,624
to her future service to Alaska,

1107
00:55:32,466 --> 00:55:34,919
the Republican party, and our country.

1108
00:56:02,251 --> 00:56:05,113
There were numerous instances
of her saying things

1109
00:56:05,413 --> 00:56:06,489
that were not accurate

1110
00:56:06,831 --> 00:56:08,283
that opened the door to criticism

1111
00:56:08,624 --> 00:56:11,327
that she was being
untruthful and inaccurate.

1112
00:56:11,669 --> 00:56:15,247
And I think that is something
that continues to this day.

1113
00:56:15,589 --> 00:56:16,790
And you think that's fair criticism?

1114
00:56:17,132 --> 00:56:18,417
I think that's fair criticism.

1115
00:56:18,759 --> 00:56:20,085
Early on, though, you apparently said

1116
00:56:20,427 --> 00:56:21,545
she doesn't know anything.

1117
00:56:21,886 --> 00:56:24,256
In the immediate aftermath
of her selection,

1118
00:56:24,597 --> 00:56:27,800
it was clear to us that we...

1119
00:56:28,142 --> 00:56:29,594
had a lot of work to do.

1120
00:56:30,135 --> 00:56:32,671
For you, picking Sarah Palin
was about winning an election,

1121
00:56:32,813 --> 00:56:35,975
not necessarily about who's gonna
be best as vice president.

1122
00:56:36,675 --> 00:56:39,686
My job is to give political advice.

1123
00:56:40,028 --> 00:56:41,897
We needed to do something bold

1124
00:56:42,238 --> 00:56:43,773
to try to win the race.

1125
00:56:44,115 --> 00:56:45,817
If you had it to do over again,

1126
00:56:47,117 --> 00:56:48,819
would you have her on the ticket?

1127
00:56:52,289 --> 00:56:55,784
You don't get to go
back in time, Anderson,

1128
00:56:56,126 --> 00:57:00,247
and... and have do-overs in life.
