{1239}{1331}Johan became a multimillionaire|in his old age.
{1341}{1393}An old Danish aunt...
{1396}{1488}who had been a renowned|opera singer...
{1491}{1570}left him a fortune.
{1613}{1782}Once he became financially|independent, he left the university.
{1831}{1972}He bought his grandparents'|summer house.
{1989}{2113}A run-down chalet in an|isolated area near Orsa.
{2199}{2280}Johan and I|haven't had any contact
{2300}{2379}with each other|for many years.
{2426}{2557}Our daughters are far away,|even from me.
{2608}{2687}Martha lives in a home,
{2691}{2781}sinking in the isolation|of her illness.
{2784}{2880}I visit her now and then,|but she doesn't recognize me.
{2899}{3010}And Sarah... Sarah married|a successful lawyer...
{3014}{3175}and then moved to Australia where|they have very good jobs.
{3179}{3215}They don't have any children.
{3291}{3330}Me?
{3437}{3565}I still practice my profession,|but at the pace I choose.
{3568}{3681}Family quarrels and divorces mostly.
{3859}{3990}I've been thinking I|should visit Johan.
{4024}{4160}ONE|Marianne carries out her plan
{7948}{8085}I've been thinking...|I should visit Johan.
{8212}{8278}And now I'm here.
{8332}{8410}He's sitting there,|at the porch.
{8439}{8550}And I've been standing here,|watching him and...
{8559}{8655}waiting,|at least ten minutes.
{8714}{8881}Maybe I should have ignored|this irrational impulse.
{8891}{8947}This trip.
{8997}{9151}In fact,|I'm not an impulsive person at all.
{9177}{9234}But here I am...
{9308}{9361}And so I must decide:
{9364}{9540}Slowly return to my car...
{9591}{9675}or get close to him.
{9692}{9884}Of course, I could stay|here a while longer...
{9887}{9986}and let my confusion abate.
{9990}{10129}But not very long.|A minute more!
{10254}{10405}This minute is taking its time.
{10412}{10466}33 seconds...
{10591}{10655}47 seconds...
{10786}{10850}55 seconds...
{11359}{11390}No!
{11514}{11585}- Did I wake you?|- It's you, Marianne.
{11612}{11697}- Hi!|- No, don't get up.
{11752}{11856}- Typical, you were spying on me.|- That's not true.
{11890}{11986}We haven't seen each other in 30 years.|32 years!
{11989}{12100}- We simply lost track of|each other. - That's natural.
{12104}{12153}People start together,
{12157}{12222}then they separate|and talk by phone...
{12230}{12303}- and finally silence.|- So sad!
{12308}{12451}- ¿Was that a reproach?|- No, we had nothing to say to each other.
{12456}{12538}Then suddenly you call me|and tell me you want to visit.
{12572}{12701}- You didn't sound very keen.|- Keen? I said no.
{12705}{12861}I still say no. I don't want this.|No. But you don't care.
{12864}{12948}- I had to come.|- Why?
{12954}{13055}- I won't tell you.|- You're laughing.
{13074}{13122}Johan...
{13150}{13213}I've driven 340 km....
{13216}{13304}and managed to find your hideout...
{13307}{13359}in the middle of the jungle.
{13362}{13508}Now that I've seen and kissed you|and we've spoken I can leave.
{13512}{13627}That won't be enough.|Really?
{13638}{13730}- At least you can stay over|for dinner. - Why?
{13734}{13803}A week ago,|I told Mrs. Nilsson...
{13806}{13895}that my ex wife was coming|to visit.
{13899}{14053}I can't tell her suddenly that there'll|be no dinner. She'll go crazy.
{14073}{14166}- Who's Mrs. Nilsson?|- Agda. Agda Nilsson.
{14187}{14229}Are you and her a couple?
{14292}{14374}God forbid!
{14467}{14586}The two of you live all alone here|in the midst of a dark forest?
{14589}{14661}Mrs. Nilsson lives in|the village.
{14664}{14835}She cleans and cooks|and then goes home.
{14851}{14988}- She's religious and mean.|- There's no romance then.
{15026}{15136}To be honest,|I fear the hag.
{15152}{15306}I fear that she might want to marry me.|Anyway, stay for dinner.
{15314}{15376}She's made up the guest room,
{15385}{15453}so you have to stay|and spend the night.
{15525}{15584}I suppose I better accept.
{15608}{15716}It's so hard to get up from|this chair. No, don't help me.
{15782}{15853}What's wrong, Johan?
{15879}{15952}I'm trying to put|my arms around you.
{15955}{16013}Want to hug me?
{16239}{16289}Damn, Johan!
{16374}{16436}Old idiot!
{16441}{16576}- And how old are you?|- I don't know, and you?
{16582}{16691}- 86.|- No, not you, me!
{16714}{16776}Around 55.
{16824}{16958}- I'm 63.|- Really?  That many?
{17013}{17161}And I've had my uterus|and ovaries removed.
{17188}{17305}- Does that trouble you?|- Yes, sometimes.
{17336}{17376}Let's sit on the bench.
{17402}{17459}It's so beautiful!
{17464}{17575}When beauty is revealed...|in life, in creation...
{17592}{17699}Where is the source, the giver?|Beauty forever.
{17702}{17813}- I didn't know you knew some psalms.|- My grandmother taught me.
{17817}{17897}And my grandfather rewarded me|with little iron soldiers.
{18012}{18063}We can enjoy the view,
{18074}{18183}- hold hands...|- Are we going to hold hands?
{18186}{18279}- Didn't we used to do it?|- Yes, I believe so.
{18286}{18389}I haven't done it since...|I've stopped doing it.
{18540}{18604}You really have|a beautiful view.
{18629}{18703}Can you see the lake|house from here?
{18718}{18829}You can see the light reflected,|behind the rocks.
{18880}{18984}I drove by the lake house|coming here. It looks inhabited.
{18990}{19114}You could say that.|Henrik is there.
{19122}{19228}Yes, Henrik. Mi dear son.|The assistant professor.
{19249}{19353}- Are you on speaking terms?|- Not exactly.
{19364}{19487}I got a brief letter declaring that|he was planning on moving there.
{19509}{19588}He and his daughter Karin have|been there since late April.
{19625}{19716}You don't have much contact then.
{19723}{19816}Absolutely. A cordial conversation|if we run across each other.
{19842}{19966}- Fat boy Henrik!|He must be... - 61 !
{19984}{20079}- My God!|- You can say that again!
{20137}{20249}-  And his daughter Karin?|- Karin is 19.
{20267}{20342}Her mother died of|cancer two years ago.
{20399}{20463}- Anna...|- Tell me.
{20490}{20564}Anna and Henrik were|married for 20 years.
{20568}{20716}He couldn't take her death.|He retired before his time.
{20755}{20849}I heard they were happy|to get rid of him.
{20852}{20974}He felt mistreated there.
{20990}{21081}- Like you, at that age.|- Me? No...
{21084}{21207}Well, yes, I was a bit fed up|with the academic standards silliness.
{21249}{21321}My honorary doctorate|from the University of Michigan...
{21324}{21456}finished all that.|- We were talking about Henrik.
{21462}{21579}He directs an orchestra called|"Uppsala Chamber Soloists".
{21590}{21651}But he'll quit that also.
{21654}{21705}He must do something.
{21709}{21772}I think he's writing a book.
{21823}{21956}- What about the daughter? Karin?|- Karin also plays the cello.
{21962}{22027}She'll audition for the|conservatory in the fall.
{22033}{22083}Henrik is teaching her.
{22089}{22186}They sit in the house with|their cellos every day.
{22189}{22381}You could say she's beautiful.|Like her mother.
{22408}{22448}Yes.
{22600}{22697}So...I know nothing|about our daughters.
{22817}{22913}- Sarah is in Australia.|- Australia?!
{22940}{23062}- Yes, Australia. - Well, she|managed to get far away.
{23107}{23201}I get letters and|phone calls from her.
{23226}{23336}She's fine. A good|law firm. A good husband.
{23340}{23463}- Sarah's happy with her life.|- And poor Martha?
{23467}{23656}Martha's sinking further and further.|She didn't recognize me.
{23688}{23792}She's no longer aware, in|our sense, of the world.
{23799}{23832}I understand...
{23930}{24015}- And you?|- I can't complain.
{24035}{24104}Though sometimes, I see myself|in voluntary isolation...
{24107}{24164}and I think I'm in hell.
{24167}{24237}Like I'm dead,|but I don't know about it.
{24257}{24311}But I'm fine.
{24317}{24458}I've plagiarized my past now that|I have the page of answers.
{24477}{24524}Doesn't sound like fun.
{24529}{24609}That's it, Marianne.|It's not.
{24614}{24701}And who the hell said|that damnation would be fun?
{24730}{24867}- What does your "page of answers|say"? - Want to know?
{24874}{24992}- I asked the question, didn't I?|- It says my life was shit.
{25007}{25112}A stupid and totally senseless life.
{25141}{25231}Is our marriage part|of your hell?
{25288}{25387}- To be honest, yes.|- I'm sorry to hear that.
{25404}{25470}An old priest once told me:
{25474}{25561}"A good relationship has two elements:
{25567}{25657}a good friendship|and an unshakeable eroticism".
{25667}{25801}Nobody can say that|we weren't good friends.
{25840}{25914}- Good friends.|- Of course.
{25950}{26086}- You were unfaithful. - I...|- I was too.
{26099}{26157}- It's so sad.|- But it was long ago.
{26160}{26229}- It's still painful.|- Not for me.
{26249}{26311}No, I suppose not.
{26362}{26457}- Dearest Marianne.|- That's what you say.
{26473}{26624}Yes, it's what I say.|It's nice to be here with you.
{26638}{26737}Holding hands,|Watching the beautiful view.
{26750}{26916}- Without talking about painful things.|- You're holding my hand.
{26943}{27098}Dinner! Mrs. Nilsson|will be furious if we're late.
{27109}{27242}Johan, I need to wash up|and get my bag from the car.
{27553}{27584}This was a mistake!
{27618}{27764}TWO|Nearly a week has passed
{27914}{28017}Are you Karin? Do you want|to speak to your grandfather?
{28043}{28174}Your grandfather and Mrs. Nilsson|went to the dentist.
{28240}{28381}I'm Marianne. I was your granddad’s|wife. I'm visiting.
{28385}{28467}- I know.|- Come on, sit down.
{28615}{28707}If you want, you can help me|clean out these mushrooms.
{28724}{28766}Here's a knife.
{28884}{28989}If you want to talk, we'll talk.|If not, we can just be together.
{29023}{29086}You must know Henrik,|my dad.
{29100}{29212}Can't say I do. I've just greeted him,|but I don't know him.
{29236}{29311}- Mom is dead.|- I know.
{29327}{29464}- She died two years ago.|- Your granddad told me.
{29505}{29661}- Dad retired and is spending his time|with music now. - The cello, right?
{29673}{29746}He's writing about|St John's Passion.
{29750}{29882}- You also play the cello?|- I hope to get into the conservatory.
{29934}{30064}- Your father is the teacher|and you are the student. -Yes.
{30238}{30282}What's wrong?
{30324}{30424}Do you know Hindemith's|cello sonata, opus 25?
{30440}{30511}I don't know anything about music.
{30529}{30609}Dad wants me to play it|for the audition.
{30613}{30696}- It's too hard!|- And doesn't he think so?
{30700}{30762}How were you in the days|before your period?
{30836}{30891}A premenstrual monster.
{30916}{31091}I would go to sleep as an angel,|and wake up as a demon.
{31103}{31207}My mind gets shattered.|And it's very hard for me to get up.
{31210}{31309}Dad is a morning person.
{31327}{31382}And I yawned.
{31385}{31498}We were working on|the fourth movement.
{31530}{31629}That damned Hindemith wrote:
{31634}{31787}"Lebhafte Viertel ohne jeden|Audsdruck und stets Pianissimo"
{31807}{31887}- You know?|- It looks difficult anyhow.
{31911}{32033}So I sat there with my|shattered mind and I tried.
{32068}{32186}I begged him to let me off|the hook, to no avail.
{32192}{32309}He made me play the same part|at least twenty times!
{32312}{32441}Finally I said. quietly:|"I don't give a damn about this".
{32445}{32556}I said that it wasn't a class,|it was animal torture.
{32560}{32634}Henrik was also angry,|but he laughed and said that I should...
{32637}{32737}try from the beginning, where it says:
{32741}{32837}"Lebhaft, sehr markiert...|mit festen Bogenstrichen."
{32840}{32960}I was so angry that I couldn't.|He said I was doing it on purpose.
{32964}{33084}I said that he didn't have the|skills to teach: I was unfair.
{33087}{33252}Dad is the most patient, sensitive and|courteous teacher there is.
{33262}{33361}He said it had nothing to|do with the teaching,
{33365}{33434}but rather with willpower|and discipline...
{33437}{33533}and that I was lazy.|That I was lazy!
{33631}{33754}Then I got up and left the|cello because I was trembling.
{33784}{33929}I said that it was enough for the day|and that I was going out for a walk.
{34148}{34248}He turned pale.|I'd never seen him like that.
{34310}{34404}And he said:|"You're not leaving".
{34443}{34532}I put my boots on and|headed for the door.
{34578}{34708}I didn't hear him approach,|but he grabbed me by the shoulders...
{34711}{34759}You're not leaving!
{34857}{34936}You're not leaving!
{37662}{37739}I sat and cried.
{37763}{37904}And I said: "Never again,|never again,
{37934}{37979}...never again".
{38013}{38098}And kept crying|until I felt empty.
{38190}{38324}Then I thought of coming over to see|granddad and begging him to help me...
{38327}{38476}leave that lunatic.|It was too much for me.
{38480}{38659}Now the old man can take|care of his crazy son:
{38663}{38759}send him to the farm,|go to the police...
{38763}{38837}or kill him.
{39004}{39152}Then I became aware that|from now on, I know nothing.
{39212}{39382}I know nothing about my life,|what I'll do or become.
{39501}{39624}Then I realized|that mom is dead,
{39650}{39728}and I can't ask her anything.
{39766}{39927}I was overcome with sorrow for|myself and cried again.
{40176}{40342}You must think I'm a very|nervous person, but I'm not.
{40346}{40517}- Do you think Henrik is suicidal?|- If he'd kill himself?
{40520}{40655}In an extreme situation like|the one you're describing...
{40658}{40705}could he hurt himself?
{40708}{40856}You know, to be honest,|I don't know my father very well.
{40876}{41000}I only know that deep|inside he's... good.
{41015}{41064}If not, mom never...
{41108}{41229}Mom loved him, you know?|They loved each other.
{41243}{41392}And I suppose I was|out of that love.
{41415}{41550}That's what I think when I'm feeling sorry for|myself and I get tired of my boyfriends.
{41593}{41690}Why can't I feel love|like mom did?
{41791}{41916}Were you afraid your dad would|kill himself after her death?
{41920}{41998}I never gave his|tragedy much thought.
{42048}{42135}But I tried to take care of mom,|as much as he'd let me.
{42206}{42278}Mom was never very talkative.
{42361}{42439}But on one of her last days...
{42443}{42542}She was always drowsy|from the morphine...
{42599}{42754}On one of her last days,|I was sitting beside her,
{42775}{42850}she looked at me and said clearly:
{42908}{42973}"You know I love you".
{43024}{43100}"You know I love you, Karin".
{43238}{43314}My mother never spoke that way.
{43376}{43473}Dad once said as a joke,|this was a long time ago,
{43481}{43635}"Anna never says I love you, but|her actions are always full of love".
{43768}{43930}- What if grandfather comes back?|- It's OK, I've got another bottle.
{44282}{44400}- Were you really married to grandpa?|- Is that so strange?
{44428}{44555}It's hard to imagine it.|What kind of person is he?
{44584}{44629}Good question.
{44653}{44783}- Did you love him? - I've asked myself|the same question all my life.
{44786}{44943}- Was he so difficult?|- We were married for 16 years.
{44961}{45060}Then we got divorced.|He had met another woman,
{45064}{45126}an idiot named Paula.
{45150}{45285}I got married again to|a boring glider pilot.
{45303}{45405}One day, he just flew away.
{45415}{45512}They never found him.
{45593}{45699}For some reason, Johan and I|got together several times.
{45703}{45826}Then I found out|he was servicing...
{45829}{45942}another lady,|a real whore.
{45953}{46037}I was angry and hurt|and finished with him.
{46058}{46122}I suddenly realized,
{46126}{46262}that I was the most cheated on|wife and lover in the world.
{46283}{46423}Johan was remarkably and|compulsively unfaithful.
{46438}{46548}- You mean that my grand father|-...was a real liar.
{46566}{46738}And he used to write poems. A volume got|published, but it wasn't successful.
{46741}{46892}- My grandfather used to write verses?|- Yes, even love poems for me.
{46911}{46958}- Did you keep them?|- No.
{46963}{47001}But did you love him?
{47158}{47289}I was terribly naive.
{47300}{47440}Nowadays, I suppose it's just|not possible to be so, so childish...
{47444}{47542}and so know-it-all like I was.
{47663}{47840}I think I loved him.|Utterly.
{47857}{47957}- You never suspected?|- Not for an instant.
{48011}{48163}- What made you come here|suddenly? - I don't know.
{48225}{48332}You still love him!|Don't you?
{48363}{48485}If you had to be honest,|Marianne...
{48608}{48789}I hear people say Johan|is this or that,
{48793}{48862}not very kind things usually.
{48903}{49007}But I don't know the Johan|they're talking about.
{49050}{49213}I always thought he was a good man.|Very, very good.
{49238}{49376}It was so easy to hurt him,|he could never defend himself.
{49528}{49566}I believe that Johan...
{49632}{49693}is a moving person.
{49786}{49848}He's moving.
{49868}{49960}- Are you crying?|- Yes, a little.
{49993}{50066}Are you crying for granddad?
{50186}{50360}- I'm crying for Johan|and Marianne. - I understand.
{50474}{50530}This is strange.
{50810}{50852}Dear...
{50950}{51030}- What will you do?|- Return to Henrik.
{51050}{51155}- Is that intelligent?|- It has nothing to do with that.
{51183}{51282}I'll stay here a few more days.|Let me know what happens.
{51332}{51393}I will.
{51611}{51690}THREE|About Anna
{52106}{52153}It can't happen again.
{52184}{52250}- Never again.|- Never.
{52278}{52325}We must have a serious talk.
{52329}{52508}We both know how things are.|There's nothing to sort out.
{52511}{52565}I'm glad it's so simple!
{52635}{52680}I was scared to death.
{52683}{52782}There's no other way to put it:|I was scared to death.
{52791}{52935}- Do you understand? - I'm very|tired. I'm going to sleep.
{53091}{53165}- Are you asleep?|- No.
{53633}{53713}Once I had a similar|situation with Anna.
{53810}{53923}We weren't married yet,|but we lived together.
{53989}{54152}Maybe I was a little drunk.|I said nasty things about...
{54156}{54235}the damned university,
{54239}{54310}my colleagues,|our work environment.
{54313}{54443}And then about my father,|that old bastard.
{54489}{54599}Anna didn't say a word.|And that upset me even more.
{54661}{54723}I remember thinking...
{54754}{54865}"What's on Anna's mind,|while she's sewing that skirt?"
{54936}{55124}"What's she thinking? Maybe|that Henrik is unbearable".
{55163}{55228}And then she said it.
{55254}{55291}"When you're like this,
{55294}{55413}I start thinking that you're|not the man I planned to marry".
{55504}{55606}Then she went to the living|room and started to pack.
{55634}{55693}I tried to stop her.|She didn't move...
{55696}{55777}but a message got through|from her body to mine.
{55811}{55938}It said "I'm leaving...|I'm leaving you".
{55941}{56177}Then I said, with a voice that was|foreign to me: "Nobody leaves me".
{56239}{56306}"Nobody leaves me"
{56434}{56603}"Nobody turns his back on me|and leaves... ".
{56629}{56853}I sat on the floor and|thought: "It's over".
{57136}{57463}I shut my eyes and thought:|"Anna's leaving and she won't return".
{57581}{57673}But then I heard her|going around the kitchen.
{57704}{57758}She was making coffee.
{57841}{58027}But she didn't say a word.|Maybe she wanted to sober me up.
{58062}{58235}She didn't say anything for the rest|of the evening: just kept on sewing.
{58261}{58403}Anna was the silent type|anyway, she never spoke much.
{58466}{58587}But we didn't need to speak;|we always knew...
{58651}{58723}I begged her to forgive me.
{58726}{58828}Like a child to his mother:|"I won't do it again".
{58891}{59040}It's just what I want to say to you,|but it sounds ridiculous.
{59059}{59179}Anyone can say "I'm sorry",|but it's meaningless.
{59259}{59352}So no further words|were spoken that night.
{59402}{59583}It became a...|distant night.
{59689}{59849}Anna sunk into a deep sleep: I|stayed awake listening to her breathing.
{59891}{60028}I watched her, a street light|shone through the window.
{60066}{60207}I gazed at her for a long time and|wondered if she really knew...
{60211}{60337}how much I loved her.
{60514}{60653}Between Anna and me it was a question|of belonging, if you know what I mean.
{60691}{60878}An ownership that was...|a miracle. I know it sounds fatuous.
{60926}{61003}There's no better word.
{61103}{61207}I fell asleep as dawn approached,|and when the alarm clock rang,
{61224}{61318}we got up, had breakfast|and chatted as usual.
{61339}{61438}I went to a class|and Anna went to the library.
{61627}{61754}This is an explanation:|not an excuse.
{61757}{61816}I have no excuses.
{61929}{61978}If you leave me...
{62033}{62160}I’ll be ruined, or some other|word that doesn't exist.
{62186}{62272}In due time, you'll have your freedom.|You'll go to the conservatory...
{62275}{62385}With professional teachers|and a different life.
{62501}{62550}It'll be different for me also.
{62782}{62940}These months with you have|been "a state of grace".
{62984}{63063}For me, that is,|not for you.
{63104}{63183}It was kind of you|to return so soon.
{63229}{63353}I don't know what to say.|It's all so complicated.
{63376}{63426}We don't have to|speak about that.
{63709}{63824}Sometimes I feel a great|punishment awaits me.
{64470}{64513}FOUR
{64517}{64653}About a week later,|Henrik visits his father.
{64741}{64834}"Kierkegaard, S.|Or A Fragment of Life"
{65232}{65324}- Am I interrupting?|- Oh, so it's you.
{65370}{65407}It's been a long time.
{65504}{65655}- How are you?|- Well, thank you, and you?
{65691}{65804}At 60 there's 6 things wrong with you,|at 70, 7 and so on.
{65810}{65984}It's a good evaluation: Of course,|it depends on your priorities.
{66314}{66440}- I heard about your ex wife's unexpected visit.|- Typical Marianne.
{66454}{66543}She's always known I|hate improvisation.
{66585}{66676}- Maybe I can see her.|- She's gathering strawberries.
{66690}{66768}I don't know if you'll be|here when she returns.
{66817}{66931}- I don't mean to disturb you.|- Thanks for being considerate.
{67027}{67060}What do you want?
{67236}{67347}I need 890,000 kroner.|An advance on my inheritance.
{67350}{67450}- You need money again.|- I know, I owe you 200,000.
{67454}{67561}- That you haven't even begun to pay back.|- Don't worry, I'll pay it back.
{67565}{67663}I'm sure I'll never|see that money again.
{67677}{67759}It's funny to|consider it a "loan".
{67789}{67857}If humiliating me amuses you,|let's not forget...
{67861}{68025}I'm not paying rent|on the lake house.
{68059}{68211}We've been there for five months|and you haven't seen a cent.
{68215}{68254}But you were able|to buy a new car.
{68257}{68349}It's a loan.|The owner is away.
{68376}{68463}When he returns in October,|I'll be without a car.
{68565}{68663}- How's the book going?|- Well, thank you.
{68726}{68767}That's a thorough answer.
{68867}{68975}I've been here ten minutes,|letting you humiliate me.
{68990}{69105}If I didn't need the money,|I'd have left long ago.
{69109}{69144}You can leave now.
{69518}{69602}It's not for me.|It's for Karin.
{69659}{69788}I see...|Marianne told me you two argued.
{69802}{69860}Are you trying to make her stay?
{69866}{69925}Do you think she'll accept a bribe?
{69962}{70055}I wonder how Anna|was able to stand you.
{70059}{70113}Don't bring Anna into this.
{70155}{70241}Don't you dare mention|Anna with that mouth.
{70275}{70401}I like you more or dislike you|less when you use that tone.
{70420}{70541}There's a healthy dose of|hate in your banalities.
{70852}{70888}It's like this:
{70919}{71031}There's a cello I can buy Karin;|an 1815 Fagnola.
{71044}{71128}It's an excellent instrument,|almost like a Guarneri.
{71144}{71308}Karin has a special talent,|she could become a great musician.
{71327}{71386}I took care of her instruction,
{71389}{71523}but her talent calls for more.|Like her cello.
{71526}{71631}Her German cello is passable,
{71635}{71715}but she'll audition|for the conservatory.
{71719}{71788}Are you sure it's good?
{71817}{71913}It wouldn't be the first|time they fool you.
{71917}{71967}It has an authenticity certificate
{71970}{72107}- and the seller is decent.|- Is that why it's so cheap?
{72157}{72276}He's old and sick and can't|take care of it any more.
{72305}{72435}- He said it's perfect for her.|- How touching.
{72876}{73003}Dad, where does all this|hostility come from?
{73045}{73224}Speak for yourself. When you were|18 or 19 I tried to approach you.
{73245}{73385}You had been very ill and your|mother wanted us to talk.
{73389}{73569}I told you I knew I had been a bad father,|but I wanted to make it better.
{73601}{73691}And you screamed.|Yes, screamed:
{73715}{73818}Bad father?!|You never were a father!
{73840}{73943}Then you said you could|do without my help.
{73968}{74117}Honest hate must be respected;|I respect it.
{74130}{74266}But I couldn't care less if|you hate me. You hardly exist.
{74301}{74426}If it wasn't for Karin,|who thank God is like her mother,
{74430}{74524}you wouldn't exist at all for me.
{74569}{74658}There's no hostility here, I swear.
{74692}{74886}Give me the name and number|of the cello owner and I'll see.
{75392}{75454}- Here you are.|- Thank you.
{75715}{75839}- What's your answer?|- I'll let you know.
{75881}{75934}Can I go?
{76017}{76054}I'm leaving.
{76137}{76206}- Can I just say one thing?|- Only if you must.
{76365}{76531}That tale of an argument|fifty years ago in no excuse.
{76580}{76632}Poor Anna.
{76677}{76726}Will you hit me now?
{76887}{76963}FIVE
{79642}{79700}I hope I'm not interrupting.
{79738}{79849}No, I've just finished.|I practice in the mornings.
{79862}{79986}The organist is expecting:|I'm replacing her.
{79990}{80091}- I thought you played the cello.|- I have an organ diploma.
{80106}{80202}In my time,|it was smart to have one.
{80208}{80288}There were a lot of churches|and few orchestras.
{80302}{80336}What were you playing?
{80339}{80408}A Bach sonata for a trio.|First movement.
{80484}{80641}- It was beautiful.|- This is a unique organ from 1728.
{80682}{80776}Nobody knows how it ended up here,|in the middle of nothing.
{80852}{80929}A few weeks ago, Karin and I|played a concert here.
{80932}{80989}It was almost full.
{81001}{81066}- Will you be playing any more concerts?|- I don't have the time.
{81081}{81163}Karin has to prepare her audition|and I have to finish my book.
{81195}{81314}Yes, I'm writing a book about|Bach's Passion of St. John.
{81393}{81514}I met Karin.|They say she's talented.
{81517}{81619}She's considered exceptional,|and not only by her dad.
{81635}{81711}- Are you her teacher?|- That's the way it's turned out.
{81745}{81852}In the conservatory, she'll|have the best European teachers.
{81860}{81944}- Won't it be difficult to let her go?|- Yes.
{82077}{82125}You could say that.
{82143}{82208}- Do you love her a lot?|- Yes.
{82239}{82293}- I'm sorry.|- No, it's all right.
{82426}{82525}- Karin is like Anna.|- She doesn't look like her.
{82560}{82601}What's wrong?
{82717}{82829}Whenever I mention Anna,|I cry. That's the way it is.
{82877}{82916}I can't help it.
{82969}{83127}She's been dead for two years and|it still hurts just the same.
{83190}{83234}That's the way it is.
{83405}{83459}Life itself has become a ritual.
{83570}{83632}I don't know, I can't find|words to describe it.
{83688}{83739}I've become a handicapped person.
{83784}{83889}Just like that.|Handicapped.
{84027}{84085}Karin is everything that|lends sense into my life.
{84137}{84176}And so...
{84256}{84314}It wouldn't have much|sense without her.
{84578}{84661}I think a lot about|death these days.
{84703}{84735}I think:
{84817}{84902}One day I'll walk through|the forest to the river.
{84951}{85059}A foggy, windless autumn day.
{85096}{85156}Absolute silence.
{85232}{85354}Then I see someone|by the gate.
{85378}{85509}Coming towards me. She's|wearing a denim skirt...
{85527}{85574}A blue jacket...
{85632}{85756}She's barefoot and her hair|is tied up in a long pony tail.
{85782}{85832}And she's walking towards me.
{85912}{86054}Anna is walking towards me,|through the gate.
{86151}{86207}And then I realize I'm dead.
{86290}{86362}Then something strange happens.
{86383}{86464}I think: "Is it this easy?"
{86542}{86701}We spend life thinking about|death and what comes after.
{86718}{86769}And then it's so easy.
{86905}{87015}I can see a flickering light|in the music. Like Bach.
{87115}{87209}- I think I understand.|- Come for dinner tonight.
{87215}{87342}- We're good cooks.|- Thanks, I like that.
{87345}{87466}I have to go now,|we've got a class.
{87470}{87541}Karin gets angry|if I'm late.
{87545}{87681}- See you soon.|- Wait, I don't think I can go.
{87690}{87770}- I understand. The old man|would get mad... - No.
{87788}{87857}- Why did you come here?|- I don't know.
{88010}{88161}You're a lawyer, right?|Can I sue him?
{88177}{88350}- Why would you want to do that?|- He's got a fortune and won't die.
{88381}{88466}He's probably mummified|by his own evil.
{88516}{88631}I asked him for an advance on my|inheritance, but he humiliated me.
{88661}{88708}I'd love to sue him.
{88712}{88777}Not while he's|mentally competent.
{88781}{88901}- He's not ill in that sense.|- No, he's not ill.
{88920}{89067}Are you here to ask for money|for a poor abandoned wife?
{89080}{89179}Don't get angry.|Of course I ask myself.
{89182}{89239}You haven't had|contact for decades.
{89276}{89345}I'm not here to ask for money.
{89368}{89407}Are you fucking?
{89453}{89564}Do you hate him so much to|have to talk this way?
{89568}{89734}Forgive me for desecrating this|place and ruining our chat.
{89788}{89867}I hate him in all possible|dimensions of the word.
{89891}{90026}I hate him so much, I would like to|see him die from a horrible illness.
{90040}{90184}I'd visit him every day,|just to witness his torment.
{90262}{90382}Maybe I'm just a pathetic|soul. Theoretically.
{90445}{90532}I see surprise and displeasure|in your eyes.
{90544}{90630}As a lawyer,|you should be used to...
{90634}{90742}the stupidity and repulsiveness|in the world.
{90808}{90890}Goodbye, Marianne. It was nice|of you to listen to me.
{91007}{91189}Sometimes I think I'm insane.|I suffer all the time.
{93966}{94079}SIX|AN OFFER
{95966}{96020}- Karin!|- Hi, granddad.
{96120}{96253}- Well... this is my study.|- I haven't been here for years.
{96266}{96404}You and Anna would come sometimes,|when you were living at the lake house.
{96409}{96515}- You used to smoke then.|- Yes, you're right.
{96535}{96608}I stopped when I read|Freud's biography.
{96612}{96701}33 operations for a mouth cancer.
{96711}{96806}- And even then he couldn't stop smoking.|- Bur are you all right?
{96816}{96911}Unless you consider|aging an illness.
{96945}{97110}- That's a beautiful picture of mom.|- I found it by chance.
{97113}{97254}I had it blown up...|and there it is.
{97287}{97410}I think of mom every day.|And dream of her at night.
{97426}{97555}I thought the pain would subside.|But that's not happening.
{97566}{97715}But it doesn't hurt like in the|beginning, now it's here.
{97736}{97861}Like a part of me.|I wouldn't want to be without her.
{97883}{97990}I can say I miss her,|painfully.
{98021}{98120}We didn't see each other very often,|due to Henrik and I.
{98184}{98249}Anna tried and tried.
{98252}{98345}But Henrik and I never|managed... well, you know.
{98354}{98442}- You wanted to speak to me?|- Yes, sit down.
{98487}{98615}Last night, Mrs. Nilsson came|personally to deliver a letter.
{98618}{98664}Meaning that dad shouldn't...
{98668}{98724}That was all right.
{98728}{98802}He's in Uppsala with his orchestra.
{98805}{98959}I have here a letter that came a|few days ago, and it involves you.
{98980}{99129}- Have you heard of Ivan Chablov?|- Director in St. Petersburg.
{99193}{99282}He toured here recently with|the philharmonic. Fantastic!
{99302}{99480}I've known him since my years in|Leningrad. This letter is from him.
{99496}{99569}"Johan, my dear friend and brother".
{99595}{99725}"Sorry for writing in my|poor English and German"
{99746}{99810}"but my excellent secretary
{99820}{99914}has just had twins".
{99965}{100095}"It's very important that I|write you, my dear friend".
{100116}{100183}"For the following reason:"
{100213}{100321}"On a free night, I went to a|young musician's concert".
{100337}{100427}"I must say I was|surprised and happy".
{100478}{100569}"A young female cellist was playing...
{100585}{100688}"a Zoltan Kodaly solo piece."
{100706}{100838}"And I was surprised by that|young performer's talent."
{100846}{100978}-"Her maturity, her skill|and courage". - Well, I'll be!
{101077}{101127}"The school gave me her name...""
{101131}{101215}"and told me her father|was her teacher."
{101218}{101335}"I got in touch with him,|but he rejected me curtly,"
{101343}{101407}"maybe arrogantly is a better word."
{101452}{101539}"My dear Johan,|I know you're ..."
{101543}{101582}her grandfather.""
{101585}{101685}"And that's the reason why|I'm writing you."
{101716}{101838}"The young lady's technique is|risky, somewhat lacking:""
{101859}{101977}"which could result in|a future catastrophe".
{102033}{102162}"I'm a guest professor at|Helsinki's Sibelius Academy,""
{102185}{102242}"One of the best in Europe."
{102255}{102333}"I have a good rapport|with the president."
{102336}{102463}"And we could, after|the mandatory exam,""
{102471}{102625}"offer our young cellist|a quality education..
{102668}{102761}that her talent|obviously deserves."
{102833}{102982}Let me know your answer as soon|as possible. My embrace, Ivan.""
{103036}{103135}So, Karin, what do you say?|Maybe I should add...
{103139}{103275}that I'll take care of all your|expenses as long as you need it.
{103331}{103467}I've spoken to the cello seller:|I've made him a good offer.
{103471}{103520}More than he was asking for.
{103531}{103601}So if you want it, it's yours.
{103604}{103728}Assuming, of course, that you|accept Chablov's kind offer.
{103787}{103925}I don't know what to say.|It's overwhelming.
{103930}{104043}I understand this letter puts|you in an awkward situation.
{104058}{104169}- I'll write him and tell him|that you're... - Flattered.
{104179}{104270}But that your decision|affects others.
{104296}{104435}- Others?|- Your father, specifically.
{104456}{104510}I need to rest.|Goodbye, Karin.
{104527}{104567}Thanks for the chat.
{104684}{104780}Marianne used to say that I was|a terrible character judge.
{104784}{104992}That I didn't understand emotions.|But even I understand this:
{105018}{105082}Your mother lived|in this world...
{105091}{105151}to do the most unbearable chore.
{105156}{105205}Darkness got even darker...
{105209}{105286}and light faded away|when Anna died.
{105289}{105363}It's hard for Henrik. To live.|Despite everything.
{105367}{105438}You're like your mother.
{105458}{105540}And I'm fond of you, Katja.
{105572}{105663}- Goodbye, Karin.|- Goodbye, grandfather.
{107302}{107475}SEVEN|ANNA'S LETTER
{108754}{108915}- To Henrik from Anna?|- I found it in a book.
{109009}{109101}May 18. Anna...
{109105}{109177}wrote it one week|before dying.
{109181}{109216}I'd like you to read it.
{109336}{109451}I can't understand Anna's handwriting.|You'll have to read it to me.
{109491}{109630}I'll try.|Here, have some whisky.
{109806}{109865}Mom had found out a|few days before...
{109869}{109943}that she didn't have|much time left.
{109952}{110019}She wrote the letter because|Henrik had a cold...
{110022}{110065}and wasn't allowed to visit her.
{110131}{110160}It says:
{110254}{110332}"The fact that you can't|visit me is, perhaps,
{110336}{110390}a relief for both".
{110409}{110527}"We understand each other well.|You open the door."
{110556}{110635}"I make an effort.|You make an effort".
{110663}{110783}"But I still see in your|eyes how sick I am".
{110956}{111015}This is the difficult part.
{111063}{111176}- She writes about dad and me.|- Is that painful?
{111191}{111228}Yes.
{111283}{111355}When you were with|her at the hospital,
{111366}{111446}did you speak about|what she had written?
{111459}{111570}- No, never.|- What did she write?
{111811}{111980}"Dear Henrik, I have to tell you|something of which we've never spoken".
{112021}{112116}"I've wanted to talk|to you about Karin".
{112132}{112263}"But it was never necessary|because I was always there".
{112289}{112385}"Then I got sick|and I was there no longer".
{112414}{112568}"Of course I was there,|but you kept me apart".
{112612}{112786}"You and I love each other.|I was sure about our love".
{112831}{112906}"But no love is strong enough...
{112909}{113065}to stand a devastating|effect like my illness".
{113096}{113239}"I see that you love Karin, but that|you also tie her to you".
{113277}{113396}"It's good that you were her|teacher, but there's a limit".
{113441}{113540}"When I'm no longer there,|the limit will be unclear".
{113569}{113621}"I know that Karin loves you".
{113671}{113815}"But you mustn't use her love.|You'll hurt her".
{113863}{113940}"That could be a permanent wound".
{114007}{114140}"That's why I ask|you to let her go".
{114166}{114260}"You shouldn't take|advantage of her kinship".
{114269}{114432}"Don't take advantage of her because|you're her self-proclaimed teacher.
{114504}{114556}"Dearest Henrik".
{114586}{114728}"You're so sensitive,|so considerate, so kind".
{114762}{114884}"I know it, without a doubt,|after so many years together".
{114936}{115046}"But you must be careful|not to burden Karin...
{115056}{115191}with the orphaned love that will remain|when I'm no longer there".
{115264}{115385}There's more,|but I don't want to read any more.
{115406}{115501}I can't.|It hurts so much!
{115537}{115610}I can hear my mother's voice!
{115767}{115806}Karin...
{115845}{115943}Why did you reach out to me?
{115957}{116078}- You're very involved.|- You could say that.
{116094}{116195}- And you know about granddad’s|plans. - He told me.
{116216}{116364}I don't expect advise,|I need to hear my voice aloud.
{116369}{116468}I believe things will|clear up this way.
{116471}{116510}Go ahead, speak.
{116571}{116731}- Mom saw.|- Yes, I think so.
{116739}{116833}And everything she warned|about has happened.
{116862}{117016}- I can't accept grandfather's|offer. - Why not?
{117027}{117091}If I leave Henrik, he'll die!
{117141}{117260}If I leave him, he'll die...|I'm sure about it, Marianne...
{117264}{117360}He doesn't even have|his orchestra anymore!
{117372}{117494}He can go on with his music,|but the county is reorganizing...
{117504}{117702}and dad will not be part of|the administration: he'll resign.
{117717}{117859}I can't leave him.|I'm so tired of him sometimes!
{117863}{117963}I know all the things|I can do in the future.
{118012}{118110}But mom is dead, and Henrik|can't manage his own life.
{118147}{118321}How do you think I'd feel with the|guilt if something happened to him?
{118338}{118465}My future and Henrik's|are entwined for now.
{118503}{118686}- At least you say "for now".|- Only for consolation.
{118718}{118870}- I want you to know that I don't|feel the same as you. - I know.
{119157}{119319}- Anna's love...|- That letter is love.
{119339}{119386}Isn't it?
{119538}{119571}I don't know.
{119612}{119696}EIGHT
{119879}{119995}- Back already? - There wasn't|much to do in Uppsala.
{120004}{120066}- Hi, dad.|- Hi, little Katja.
{120217}{120264}What score is that?
{120292}{120387}Bach's suites for cello!|You're mad!
{120409}{120487}Listen, Anderberg suggested|that you and I...
{120490}{120593}play a concert in November.
{120614}{120713}- It's very hard for me.|- We'll play together.
{120730}{120861}- What do you mean together?|- Like a dialogue, facing each other.
{120865}{120960}You'll play the parts you can handle|and I'll play the difficult ones.
{120963}{121101}Especially the prelude.|It'll be great!
{121107}{121221}- Which parts can I play?|- The Sarabandes, for example.
{121233}{121390}- It takes a lifetime to tame them.|- We have three months.
{121411}{121501}- And my audition?|- It's almost ready.
{121506}{121578}And students get permission|to play concerts.
{121581}{121644}I've spoken to Börtz.
{121660}{121838}It'll be good for the both of us,|now that I don't have the orchestra.
{121909}{122018}I won't even be the first|violin any longer.
{122022}{122157}- Dad! You must be furious!|- Perhaps.
{122163}{122238}But now I'll have|more time for you.
{122242}{122351}- I can help you better.|- Yes, of course.
{122454}{122521}That doesn't sound|very encouraging.
{122587}{122671}Hello, Katja, darling.
{123017}{123106}I have a feeling an|argument is coming.
{123262}{123321}- What's wrong, Katja?|- I don't know.
{123434}{123554}That is, I think I know,|but I don't know how to...
{124347}{124406}I know you've talked|to your grandfather.
{124457}{124568}- And with the bitch, I mean Marianne.|- Yes.
{124607}{124779}- I see. You did it beautifully.|- I must decide.
{124792}{124868}- I thought you had already done that.|- No, you did it.
{124889}{125035}Really? I mean,|is that what you've been thinking?
{125038}{125138}Dad...|I haven't bothered to think.
{125146}{125303}I thought, "Dad knows|what's best for me".
{125494}{125618}Perhaps you've already made|up your mind, haven't you?
{125645}{125719}Will you accept your|grandfather's offer?
{125947}{126003}- Have you read this?|- I have.
{126072}{126183}- You read the letter that mom|wrote me? - It speaks about me.
{126187}{126279}But it was for me!|And you read it. Just like that.
{126305}{126456}Do you think that's all right|because it speaks about you?
{126459}{126571}If you're going to get so upset,|it's no use talking about it.
{126590}{126645}I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
{126662}{126761}- I said I'm sorry, damn it!|- Why do you say you're sorry?!
{126781}{126894}Shall we get to work?|Or is there something else?
{127098}{127133}Dad...
{127165}{127214}It'll be painful.
{127219}{127264}For you or for me?
{127268}{127354}It may sound stupid,|but your tone frightens me.
{127358}{127504}I've made up my mind. For the first|time in my life it's my decision.
{127510}{127610}- But are you sad?|- Yes, I'm sad.
{127704}{127793}If you had told me you|had that letter from mom...
{127830}{127961}If you had let me read it,|maybe we could have...
{128019}{128133}You never told me...|You should have...
{128292}{128379}- Well, that's the way it is.|- How?
{128489}{128584}Next week, I'm going|to Hamburg with Emma.
{128609}{128713}She and I will be going to a school|for young orchestra musicians.
{128754}{128884}Claudio Abbado will come in|October and we'll go to Munich.
{129030}{129177}It's for young people from all over Europe.|You can't be older than 22.
{129206}{129336}Abbado will work with us for six weeks|and we'll play four concerts.
{129364}{129533}Emma recorded a video. She sent it|to the admission committee, as a joke...
{129537}{129582}We played Brahms.
{129604}{129659}Emma and I|got a letter...
{129670}{129811}which says the school accepts us.
{129819}{129867}That we're welcome.
{129904}{129934}And that...
{130020}{130116}That's exactly|what I want to do.
{130155}{130226}And it's exactly what|I've decided to do.
{130285}{130333}And the conservatory?
{130559}{130694}- How long is the Hamburg course?|- Two years.
{130730}{130839}Then there's a paid internship in|an Austrian or German orchestra
{130862}{130889}Three years.
{130960}{131064}- How will you pay for it?|- I have my inheritance.
{131147}{131242}- You've been thinking a lot.|- I told Emma it was useless.
{131247}{131331}That you had already decided.
{131494}{131531}God...
{131588}{131671}Oh God...
{131780}{131921}But dad, I don't want to...|I don't consider myself a soloist.
{131937}{132083}I want to play in an orchestra,|be part of a team effort.
{132087}{132210}Not sit down in a stage,|alone and exposed.
{132214}{132359}I don't want strangers to say|that I'm not good enough.
{132363}{132495}I want to decide my own future.|I want a simple life
{132513}{132654}I want to be... home.|To live a normal life.
{132665}{132727}Not a poor substitute for mom...
{132730}{132839}who gets your praise|for something I'm not.
{132869}{132921}It has to end.
{132969}{133022}And now it's ended.
{133195}{133258}At least,|give it the perfect ending.
{133282}{133316}What are you talking about?
{133547}{133661}Wouldn't you like to|play the fifth Sarabande?
{133672}{133756}- Right now?|- Yes, please.
{135592}{135678}NINE|CRUCIAL MOMENT
{135697}{135757}He's here.
{135832}{135859}Thank you.
{135936}{136019}- Can I ask who it was?|- From the hospital.
{136040}{136141}Henrik tried to commit suicide.|With pills.
{136146}{136247}Then he cut his arms|and neck with a knife.
{136255}{136306}He's in intensive care.
{136309}{136419}Call this number and|ask for nurse Ingegerd.
{136423}{136556}- God. - They found him|at the last moment.
{136564}{136632}A certain Mrs. Berg|was walking by the house...
{136635}{136759}- and saw a naked person|on the floor. - God.
{136786}{136859}The door was unlocked.
{136862}{136952}She tried to wake him up,|but he was unconscious.
{136979}{137116}And bleeding. The ambulance|took 20 minutes. - My God.
{137138}{137263}I should call Karin,|but she's on her way to Hamburg.
{137298}{137463}Henrik systematically fails at everything.|He can't even kill himself.
{137495}{137614}- Say something, for God's sake.|- You want me to answer that?
{137617}{137766}- Whatever. Say something spontaneous|for once. - You can't.
{137789}{137869}Sometimes you act like|a forgotten character...
{137873}{137944}in some stupid old movie.
{137948}{138019}- You're not real.|- You don't say.
{138082}{138207}- Right now... no, let's leave it.|- No, go on.
{138230}{138313}Where did you gather|all this disdain?
{138330}{138369}I didn't remember you like this.
{138373}{138434}- Disdain?|- Yes!
{138437}{138545}I don't know. Any disdain|I have is for myself.
{138561}{138641}I don't know.|I never thought of it this way.
{138716}{138817}- And the poor boy?|- Boy?
{138843}{138979}Ah, Henrik. Maybe he realized|he was a lot like me.
{138989}{139131}I was never like him. So ridiculous|all the time. Obese and submissive.
{139148}{139287}He surrounded me with a sticky love.|I admit I ignored that love.
{139316}{139528}He was as dedicated as a dog.|I wanted to kick him, metaphorically.
{139623}{139709}- What will happen now?|- How will this affect Karin?
{139735}{139892}- She'll blame herself.|- She should have thought about it.
{139904}{140056}- Do you think she'll return home?|- I don't know.
{140090}{140196}- You'll speak to her, won't you?|- If we find her.
{140200}{140304}I'll hire you as my agent.|How much do you charge?
{140307}{140361}Money is no problem.
{140364}{140451}As long as you put her|guilt in a safe.
{140455}{140592}What if she comes?|She loves that bastard.
{140595}{140704}- That would be disastrous!|- Yes, I believe so.
{140910}{140991}What can I say?
{141035}{141087}I was so close to Anna.
{141137}{141232}It was terrible when she left.|For me also.
{141253}{141392}Even though I was on the|outskirts of the catastrophe.
{141463}{141534}It's incomprehensible that Henrik...
{141538}{141597}had the privilege|of loving Anna.
{141633}{141686}And that she loved him.
{141772}{141865}- You're smiling ironically.|- No.
{141910}{142032}I'm not smiling.|I'm trying not to cry.
{142065}{142102}There's no reason for you to cry.
{142105}{142242}There is, but I won't|give any explanations.
{142318}{142421}TEN|THE HOUR BEFORE THE DAWN
{144805}{144842}Marianne.
{144868}{144953}Marianne!|Sorry to wake you up.
{144985}{145069}It's all right.|I'll go back to sleep.
{145111}{145219}- What's wrong? Johan?|- I don't know.
{145266}{145464}- I think it's anguish.|- Anguish? What do you mean?
{145495}{145587}- I see! You're sad!|- I'm not sad...
{145613}{145754}It's worse. It's an anguish|from hell. It's bigger than me.
{145774}{145855}It's trying to make way through|every orifice in my body;
{145858}{146072}my eyes, my ass. It's like a huge|mental diarrhea!
{146186}{146261}I'm too small for this anxiety.
{146266}{146309}Are you afraid of death, Johan?
{146313}{146387}More than anything,|I'd like to scream.
{146393}{146523}What can you do with a baby|that won't be comforted?
{146533}{146635}- Come, lay by my side.|- There's no room.
{146668}{146778}- We've slept in smaller beds.|- We won't be able to sleep.
{146790}{146901}It doesn't matter. Not in|the last days of our lives.
{146904}{147034}I have to take off my shirt.|It's damp from my diarrhea.
{147039}{147078}Come on.
{147223}{147293}You take it off too.
{147305}{147337}Yes
{148114}{148188}Come on, Johan.|Come here.
{148341}{148433}There... lie down.
{148728}{148810}- Good night, Marianne.|- Good night.
{149233}{149328}Could you explain why|you turned up here?
{149338}{149441}- I thought you were calling me.|- I never called anyone.
{149445}{149560}- I had it in my head.|- How strange.
{149568}{149659}I understand your not understanding.
{149693}{149818}- How long will you stay?|- I have a case on the 27th.
{149829}{149894}- November?|- October.
{150015}{150085}- Good night, again.|- Good night.
{150208}{150272}Perhaps you're asking|yourself how it came out.
{150306}{150394}I stayed with Johan|until early October.
{150423}{150526}Our time together|was relaxingly pleasant.
{150529}{150644}We almost never talked about|sensitive subjects.
{150673}{150733}The last night we celebrated.
{150740}{150814}Nothing out of this world,|but good enough.
{150840}{150932}We promised to remain in touch.
{150936}{151020}I think we even fantasized|about a trip to Florence...
{151023}{151080}the next spring.
{151084}{151153}That trip never|happened, of course.
{151162}{151295}But we used to speak on|the phone on Sundays.
{151343}{151437}Then, one day Mrs. Nilsson|answered the phone.
{151456}{151567}She said that Johan|couldn't take any calls,
{151570}{151635}but that he would write.
{151641}{151765}I asked if he was all right;|she said yes, as far as she could tell.
{151768}{151863}That he was just tired and|that he would be writing.
{151883}{151960}I never got a letter, of course.
{151963}{152059}I wrote him, but never got an answer.
{152068}{152139}That's all I know.
{152153}{152229}Things are always all|right with me. In order.
{152241}{152383}Everything in its place. Maybe I'm a|bit lonely, but I don't know.
{152488}{152590}Sometimes... I think of Anna.
{152636}{152772}I wonder how she|managed her life.
{152918}{152987}How she spoke...
{153063}{153097}How she moved...
{153181}{153228}Her look...
{153265}{153370}That almost surreal smile.
{153486}{153542}Anna's feelings.
{153631}{153685}Anna's love.
{153894}{153939}Well...
{153995}{154183}Something happened to me that|perhaps is related to this.
{154231}{154368}When I came back, I visited|my daughter Martha at the sanatorium.
{156565}{156698}But I thought about|the enigma...
{156766}{156937}that for the first|time in our lives...
{156986}{157071}I realized...|I felt...
{157143}{157211}that I was touching my daughter.
{157280}{157315}My baby.
