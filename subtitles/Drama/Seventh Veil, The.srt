1
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,480
- Hello.
- Hello.

2
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,520
Say, I was wondering...

3
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,480
What?

4
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,800
Sorry. I was wondering
if you'd like to dance.

5
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,360
Why not?

6
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,160
Kitty, who was the young man
you were dancing with last night?

7
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,720
Which one?

8
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,200
Quiet, serious-looking one.

9
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,520
Oh, him.

10
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,960
- I suppose you invited him, mother.
- I don't know who you're talking about.

11
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,200
I invited him.

12
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,600
His name is Fane and he's a doctor.
He manages a government laboratory...

13
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,560
...in Shanghai.
- A civil servant?

14
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,440
In any case.
He called around last Sunday.

15
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,320
We had a long chat.
I told him to come back anytime.

16
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,640
It's not often that you like
any of my young men.

17
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,440
Well, do you like him?

18
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,600
- Not really.
- What's wrong with him?

19
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,040
- Is he in love with you?
- I don't know.

20
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,480
I thought by now you'd know
when a young man was in love with you.

21
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,240
The point is whether I'm in love with him,
and I'm not.

22
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,640
You'd better be careful, young lady.
Time can run out, you know.

23
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,120
Oh, stop it, mother. Honestly.

24
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,520
The very idea that a woman
should marry any Tom, Dick, or Harry...

25
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:18,440
...regardless of her own feelings
is simply prehistoric.

26
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,840
How much longer do you expect
your father to go on supporting you?

27
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,200
- Hello.
- Hello. l...

28
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,560
I was... I was just coming...

29
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,800
Your father invited me.

30
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,600
I'm going out.

31
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,840
May I join you?

32
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,600
Right on time.

33
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,840
What is it exactly that you do?

34
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,960
I'm a bacteriologist.

35
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,680
That must be fascinating.

36
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,040
You have no idea what that is, do you?

37
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,800
No, I'm afraid not.

38
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,400
No. There's no reason you should.

39
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,240
I study the microorganisms
that carry disease.

40
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,440
Charming.

41
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,760
No, it's not, actually. It's the opposite.

42
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,080
Shall we step inside?

43
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,440
Do you like flowers?

44
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,000
Not particularly, no.

45
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,920
Well, I mean, yes. But we don't really
have them around the house.

46
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,840
Mother says, "Why purchase something
you can grow for free?"

47
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,480
Then, we don't really grow them either.

48
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,640
Does seem silly, really.
To put all that effort into...

49
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,200
...something that's just going to die.

50
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,880
I'd like to say something to you.

51
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,800
I came to see you
to ask you if you'll marry me.

52
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,160
You could knock me down
with a feather.

53
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,320
Could you not tell
that I'm in love with you?

54
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,880
You never showed it.

55
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,200
Oh, I...

56
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,960
Well, I wanted to. It's difficult. I...

57
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,040
But there it is.

58
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,960
Right.

59
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,040
I'm not sure that's very well put.

60
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:07,280
No, it's not. You see how clumsy I am.
I... I'm terrible at these sorts of things.

61
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,320
But the thing is, I've got to get
back to China very soon.

62
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,120
I don't have time to be cautious.

63
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,720
I've never thought of you in that way.

64
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,360
- I improve greatly upon acquaintance.
- I'm sure you do...

65
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:21,480
I'd do anything in my power
to make you happy.

66
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,080
Anything at all.

67
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,920
I think you'd like Shanghai.

68
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,680
It's quite exciting, it is.

69
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,080
Lots of dancing.

70
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,040
Surely you're not expecting me
to answer this second.

71
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,360
I don't know you at all.

72
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:49,320
Yes. Ye...
Well, we had the highest of hopes...

73
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:53,520
...but no expectation
that he'd ask her so soon.

74
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,960
Yes. A lovely late autumn wedding.

75
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,640
Oh, she's done very well for herself,
has my Doris.

76
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,560
At least one of them's made a success.

77
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,120
No, I gave up on Kitty ages ago.

78
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,640
Yes.

79
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,720
Yes. Well, I know you understand.

80
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,600
Yes.

81
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,240
Well?

82
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,480
Is it smaller than you imagined?

83
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,200
I'm not sure what I imagined.

84
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,080
Don't you have a piano?

85
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,120
No. I don't play the piano.

86
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,840
- Who is it?
- It's I.

87
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,040
Come in.

88
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,240
Just wanted to see
if you were all settled.

89
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,440
So, then, you're comfortable, then?
Do you need anything?

90
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,920
No. I'm fine. Thank you.

91
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,200
Good. Good.

92
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,400
I am so happy you're here.

93
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,560
- Shall I shut the lamp?
- What for?

94
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,080
I must shut the lamp.

95
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,600
It's raining cats and dogs.

96
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,760
I said, it's raining cats and dogs.

97
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,480
Yes, I heard you.

98
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,600
- You might have answered.
- I'm sorry.

99
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,800
l... I've gotten used to not speaking
unless I have something to say.

100
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,840
If nobody spoke unless
they had something to say...

101
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,680
...the human race would
soon lose the power of speech.

102
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,000
Walter.

103
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,680
I'm sorry.

104
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,560
You're right. What...?

105
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,920
What shall we do? Shall we?

106
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,360
Shall we play a game?

107
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,080
You don't like the games I play.
They bore you.

108
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,520
Nonsense. Let's play cards.

109
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,360
Do you think you'd enjoy a night out?

110
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,360
We have an invitation for Saturday night.

111
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,480
- From whom?
- The Townsends.

112
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,760
Dorothy Townsend.

113
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,560
Do you not like her?

114
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,200
I've only met her once, but there's
no reason for her to put on such airs.

115
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,280
- Does she?
- Yes. I have no idea why.

116
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,160
Because she was, what,
married to a vice consul?

117
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,400
Honestly, they're absurd,
this Shanghai set.

118
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,240
Mother wouldn't dream
of asking half of them to dinner.

119
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,960
I'm taking that black five.

120
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,680
Well, it's all right.
I thought you might enjoy it...

121
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:57,040
...but we certainly don't have to go.

122
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,680
I don't care either way.

123
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,000
Go where?

124
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,320
- Kitty Fane?
- Hello, Dorothy.

125
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,160
- I'm so glad you could come.
- This is Walter.

126
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,800
- I'm pleased to meet you.
- This is my husband.

127
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,640
Charlie, stop talking
and greet our guests.

128
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,320
- You know Mr. Fane.
- Charlie.

129
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,600
- It's Dr. Fane, darling.
- Oh, dear.

130
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,120
- I do beg your pardon, Dr. Fane.
- Not at all.

131
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,280
- And this is Dr. Fane's wife, Kitty.
- Mrs. Fane.

132
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,000
- Mr. Townsend.
- I do apologize, Dr. Fane.

133
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,840
I assumed you worked with Charlie.

134
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,840
Oh, no. Nothing so glamorous.
I'm at the Civil Laboratory.

135
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,840
Oh, the government lab?
How fascinating.

136
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,040
Are you enjoying it?

137
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,080
I've never seen anything like it.

138
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,360
Every gesture has a meaning.

139
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,560
See how she covers her face
with the cloth?

140
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,240
She is mourning her misfortune.

141
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,520
What happened to her?

142
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,400
She was sold into slavery.

143
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,440
Condemned to a life
of drudgery and despair...

144
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,640
...in a strange land far from home.

145
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,320
See the chains?

146
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,480
They represent the heavy bondage
of her poor trapped soul...

147
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,000
...from which there is no escape.

148
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,480
And so she weeps.

149
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,560
She weeps for the lively,
vivacious girl she once was...

150
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,640
...the lonely woman she has become...

151
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,520
...and most of all, she weeps
for the love she'll never feel...

152
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,560
...for the love she'll never give.

153
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,720
Is that really what she's saying?

154
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,320
Actually, I haven't a clue
what she's on about.

155
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,800
I don't speak Chinese.

156
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,800
What was that?

157
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,760
Perhaps it was the amah...

158
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,320
They've gone.

159
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,560
- He heard us.
- Who?

160
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,600
Walter.

161
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,000
Walter. What if it was?

162
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,000
- For all he knows, you were taking a nap.
- With my doors locked?

163
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,800
Kitty, dear, you need a drink.

164
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,720
Even if it was,
my impression is he'll do nothing.

165
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,000
That's flattering.

166
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,840
He knows as well as anyone there's
nothing to be gained by making a scandal.

167
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,360
Has it occurred to you
that my husband is in love with me?

168
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,960
I have a feeling you're about
to say something awful.

169
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:55,960
It's just that women are
often under the impression...

170
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,440
...that men are much more
in love with them than they really are.

171
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,880
I wouldn't delude myself for a second
that you were in love with me.

172
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,120
Now there you're wrong.

173
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,760
Do you like your present?

174
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,720
It's good enough.

175
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,640
Charlie?

176
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,720
Do I make you as happy
as you make me?

177
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,720
Of course you do, darling.

178
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,680
- Hassan?
- Yes?

179
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:22,560
- Who brought this package around?
- Dr. Fane.

180
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:27,360
- When?
- While you sleeping.

181
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,960
It's nearly midday.

182
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,840
We could stop up here under the trees...

183
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,440
...but I'd like to press on
if it's all right with you.

184
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,040
Certainly my comfort's
of no concern to you.

185
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,680
Right. Then we'll continue.

186
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,080
Charlie Townsend, please.

187
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,480
Charles Townsend.

188
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,160
I need to see you.

189
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,840
Kitty, I can't possibly see you.
I've got a meeting in an hour at the club.

190
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,200
What is it?

191
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,400
I have to go.

192
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,440
What are you doing home?

193
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,840
I'm sorry, there's something
I need to speak with you about.

194
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,480
Actually, I was just about
to take my bath.

195
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:15,200
I'm afraid it's rather important, darling.
Can't wait.

196
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,920
Sit down.

197
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,120
Do you know a place called Mei-tan-fu?

198
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,760
No.

199
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,160
Well, it... It was in the papers
the other day.

200
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:44,960
It's a small town on a tributary
of the Yangtze River, in the interior.

201
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,480
They've had an outbreak
of cholera there.

202
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,040
It's the worst epidemic
anyone's seen in a long time.

203
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,760
The Chinese medical officer has died.

204
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,680
There's a convent of French nuns
trying to run the hospital.

205
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,920
They're doing the best they can,
but people are dropping like flies.

206
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,680
I have volunteered to go
and to take charge.

207
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,400
- Why?
- Because they need a doctor.

208
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,800
But you're not a doctor.
You're a bacteriologist.

209
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,960
I'm an M.D.
The fact that I'm foremost a scientist...

210
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,120
...is actually all to the good in this case.

211
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,360
Won't it be awfully dangerous?

212
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,720
I suppose it might, yes.

213
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,680
Now, Mei-tan-fu is a 10-day journey.
You can go by rail for the first part.

214
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,120
But after that it's carriage, and then
we'll have to take a sedan chair.

215
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,480
Who's we?

216
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:37,040
- Why, you and I, of course.
- You're not expecting me to come too.

217
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,560
I hoped that if I was going,
you would want to go.

218
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,840
Surely it's no place for a woman.
It would be madness for me to go.

219
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:47,440
- Why should I?
- To cheer and comfort me?

220
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,440
No. No, I won't go.

221
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,640
In fact, it's monstrous of you
to even ask me.

222
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,080
Fine. Then I shall file
my petition for divorce tomorrow.

223
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,160
I'm afraid that you have thought me
a bigger fool than I am.

224
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

225
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,760
Don't you?

226
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,440
I am divorcing you for adultery.

227
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,520
I am naming Charles Townsend
as your lover.

228
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,880
I'm sorry, Walter.
I realize this is very unpleasant.

229
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,680
But, please, let's not make this
uglier than it needs to be.

230
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,480
By all means. What is it that
you propose that we should do?

231
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,920
You could let me divorce you quietly.

232
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,840
You divorce me?

233
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,960
- On what grounds?
- That's what a gentleman would do.

234
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:50,320
Give me one reason to put myself
to an inconvenience on your account.

235
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,760
Please, Walter, don't be so hateful.

236
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,960
We didn't mean to hurt anyone.

237
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,200
But Charlie and I have fallen in love.

238
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,960
- He wants to marry me.
- Really?

239
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,200
I knew that you weren't
the cleverest girl...

240
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,360
...but I didn't know
you were actually a fool.

241
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,600
Yes. Well, if it makes you feel better
to hurt me, then go ahead.

242
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,720
But you might as well get used to it.
We love each other.

243
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,880
And we're sick to death of the secrecy
and compromise and the rest.

244
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,960
Now you curse the day
that you ever met me.

245
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,440
Stop mocking me.

246
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,880
There's no other response for
such pathetic behavior.

247
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,920
It's comic.

248
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,880
When I think about how hard
I have tried to make you happy.

249
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,600
Debasing myself, acting as though I was
as thrilled as you by the latest gossip.

250
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,160
- I don't have to listen to this.
- And as ignorant of the world as you are...

251
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,200
If you interrupt me again,
I'll strangle you.

252
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,080
Sit down.

253
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:45,760
I knew when I married you
that you were selfish and spoiled.

254
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,760
But I loved you.

255
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:53,840
I knew that you married me only to get
as far away from your mother as possible...

256
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:58,160
...and I hoped that one day
there'd be something more.

257
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,640
I was wrong.

258
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,200
You don't have it in you.

259
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,600
If a man hasn't what's necessary
to make a woman love him...

260
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,800
...then it's his fault, not hers.

261
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,640
Either way.

262
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,840
Tomorrow morning we are to leave
for Mei-tan-fu, or I shall file my petition.

263
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,400
You can't be serious about taking me
into the middle of a cholera epidemic.

264
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,200
Do you think that I'm not?

265
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,120
My God.

266
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,760
That's what you want, isn't it?

267
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,040
Do you really think
Charlie will let you do this?

268
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,840
I don't think Charlie has
very much to say about it.

269
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,880
Everything you said is true.

270
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,200
Everything.

271
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,200
I married you
even though I didn't love you.

272
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,640
But you knew that.

273
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,680
Aren't you as much to blame
for what's happened as I?

274
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,880
All right.

275
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,240
Here's what I'll do.

276
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,800
Gentlemen, we all have assets
to protect here.

277
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,920
Unfortunately, Mr. Nagata's actions
have created a rather urgent situation.

278
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,680
It was an unfortunate
but unavoidable incident.

279
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,520
- Your foreman shot a worker.
- He was an agitator.

280
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,800
He was a Chinese.

281
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,360
You may have suppressed
a very small strike...

282
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,920
...but in doing so, you have started
a very large demonstration.

283
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,480
I need to use your pen, please.

284
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,600
- Here you are, miss.
- Thank you.

285
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,440
What about support from Chiang Kai-shek?
Where does he stand?

286
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,760
He's a nationalist.
He will stand on the side of the Chinese.

287
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,880
That's why they
call themselves nationalists.

288
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,560
Excuse me.

289
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,760
Mr. Townsend.

290
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,680
I think you underestimated the situation.

291
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,640
I have three of my mills shut down
because of walkouts.

292
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,120
- There is talk about boycotts.
- What do you propose?

293
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,880
A handful of municipal soldiers is
hardly a show of force.

294
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,520
If you'll excuse me.

295
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,560
Mrs. Fane. What a pleasant surprise.

296
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,080
You've rescued me
from a pack of wild bores.

297
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,600
I wouldn't have come
if it wasn't necessary.

298
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,680
Are you all right?

299
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,520
I needed to see you. I'm sorry.

300
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,040
Kitty, this is not the most
opportune time for me to...

301
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,720
Charlie. He knows.

302
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,720
Right.

303
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,920
After you, Mrs. Fane.

304
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,040
- Hello, Charlie.
- Hello, George.

305
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:15,000
- Hello, Townsend.
- Pardon.

306
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,800
He wants a divorce.

307
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,120
You didn't commit yourself, did you?

308
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,600
- Acknowledge anything?
- No.

309
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,400
- Are you sure?
- Quite sure.

310
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,600
Well, this is a bloody scrape we're in.

311
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,600
He says he has proof.

312
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,760
We deny it. He can't prove anything.

313
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,320
Besides, it wouldn't do him any good
to create a scandal.

314
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,480
But there isn't going to be a scandal.

315
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,320
Walter's agreed to
let me divorce him quietly.

316
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,360
That's not so terrible, is it?

317
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,040
- Will you hold me?
- Of course I will.

318
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,360
Oh, God.

319
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,680
Charlie?

320
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:21,200
His offer comes with a condition.

321
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:29,040
- I'm not a rich man.
- He doesn't want your money.

322
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:33,360
He's agreed to let me divorce him
if Dorothy will agree to divorce you.

323
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:36,400
And if...

324
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,840
What?

325
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,960
If you'll promise to marry me.

326
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:51,280
You know, darling, whatever happens,
we must try to keep Dorothy out of it.

327
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,120
What do you mean?

328
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,360
We can't only think of ourselves.

329
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:02,160
I know Dorothy. Nothing in the world
will induce her to divorce me.

330
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,680
You don't want to divorce her.

331
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,280
- It's not a question of my marriage.
- Then what is it?

332
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,480
Do you have any idea of the importance
of my station here? If I were...

333
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,800
Why are you laughing?

334
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,000
I don't think Walter intended
for one minute to divorce me.

335
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,600
He knew you'd let me down.

336
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,160
- Try to understand.
- I understand, all right.

337
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:33,800
Kitty. Kitty, please.
We'll work this out, I promise.

338
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:58,080
- I'm coming with you.
- Good. I thought you might.

339
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,960
I suppose I needn't take more than
a few summer things? And a shroud?

340
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,680
I've told Hassan what you'll need.
She's packing already.

341
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:04,080
I wouldn't touch that if I was you.

342
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,840
They may have died in that bed.

343
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,200
This can be your room.

344
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,080
You must be the doctor's wife.

345
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,720
I've just met your husband
and invited myself to dinner.

346
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,680
I've kept the Watsons' cook for you.
She's not bad.

347
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,560
She'll have to do as your amah as well.

348
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,800
We're a little short-handed here.

349
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,840
Sorry, my name is Waddington.

350
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,360
Oh, yes, of course. Kitty Fane.

351
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,960
- I'm the deputy commissioner.
- Please.

352
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:52,680
I believe you're one of our neighbors.

353
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,400
Only neighbor, I'm afraid.
Last one standing.

354
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,760
And Watson was the missionary
living here?

355
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,680
Yes. Nice fellow. American.
Lovely family.

356
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,000
I'll show you their graves tomorrow,
if you like.

357
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,040
How kind of you.

358
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,000
I hope your journey wasn't too arduous.

359
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,800
We've been traveling for two weeks.

360
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,520
Two weeks?

361
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,160
- What did you do, swim?
- No, we didn't come upriver.

362
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,800
- Came overland.
- Whatever for?

363
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,440
Well, we wanted to take in
a bit of the countryside.

364
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,160
Get a bit of sun. Didn't we, darling?

365
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,960
Anyone for a cocktail?

366
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,240
Here's luck.

367
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,440
I was told I might get some help
from the local army officer.

368
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,920
Colonel Yu, is it?

369
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,880
Good luck with him.
He's not fond of us British.

370
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:54,720
Listen, I'll warn you,
things are pretty dicey even out here.

371
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,800
I'm afraid that if the cholera doesn't get us,
the nationalists might.

372
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,880
Tried to get those nuns to go
but they refused.

373
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,800
They all want to be martyrs, damn them.

374
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,360
Well, why have you stayed?

375
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,640
I was posted here. Simple as that.

376
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,800
I was shocked to hear you'd volunteered.

377
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,680
Opportunity for research.

378
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,040
I couldn't pass it up.

379
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,480
Yes. And you?

380
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,840
I don't suppose you've come
to Mei-tan-fu for the research.

381
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,240
My husband's the scientist.

382
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,440
Indeed.

383
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,560
Did you have any reaction
to the inoculation?

384
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:34,480
- You have been inoculated?
- Yes, of course.

385
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,840
No guarantee.
The Watsons were inoculated...

386
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
...and it didn't do them much good.

387
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:43,000
Oh, have you brought
any gramophone records?

388
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:47,080
- No, unfortunately not.
- Pity.

389
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,440
I'm sick of all mine.

390
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,320
Listen. What's all that?

391
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:01,680
Across the river.
Trying to frighten off the spirit of death.

392
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,240
I'm going to town in the morning,
have a look around.

393
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,960
I expect you'll want to rest.
I can inoculate you in the evening.

394
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:18,760
- Will you be doing yourself?
- No, I don't think so.

395
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,080
- You needn't bother with me, then.
- Suit yourself.

396
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,240
Tell me, Walter...

397
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,240
...is it a long, drawn-out affair,
dying of cholera?

398
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,400
No. All of the fluid goes out of you
in the first 36 hours.

399
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:37,640
You die of dehydration, actually.
So it's messy and very painful.

400
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,320
But it is relatively quick.

401
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,480
Good night.

402
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,760
It's rather unfortunate.

403
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,800
I thought perhaps that you
and your wife...

404
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:15,280
...you'd like to take precautions
in case you'd have to leave this place.

405
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,320
Do you think all this is really necessary?

406
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,720
You can see the picture.

407
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:25,520
I thought you'd like to put your wife's
mind at rest from this situation.

408
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:30,240
This is Colonel Yu.
He's the KMT's man.

409
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,880
He's posting one of his men here
at the house.

410
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,400
Am I a prisoner?

411
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,200
No. It was Mr. Waddington's idea,
actually.

412
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,560
- He feels we should take precautions.
- Precautions against what?

413
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,720
A few days ago,
British troops opened fire...

414
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,480
...on a group of Chinese workers
who were demonstrating in Shanghai.

415
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,840
Eleven were killed.

416
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,560
We've only just heard.

417
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,040
Those were plastered around the town
last night.

418
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,120
I shouldn't worry too much.

419
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,840
Even the nationalists are
afraid of cholera.

420
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,520
Do they take that water from the well?

421
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,080
Can I see where they get
their drinking water?

422
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:19,320
Well, for starters, we've got to
stop people from using this well...

423
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,960
...until I can test it.

424
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,880
Do you understand?

425
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,560
Yes, I understand, Dr. Fane.

426
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,920
I received my military training
in Moscow.

427
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,280
If you don't like English,
we can speak Russian.

428
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,000
English will be fine. Thank you.

429
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:58,560
Here. You have seen cholera before,
yes, doctor?

430
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,520
- At the laboratory, of course.
- No, I mean in a patient.

431
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,840
No. I haven't had the chance, actually.

432
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:10,720
Well, I'm not a clinician.
Did they not tell you?

433
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,080
I'm an infectious-disease specialist.

434
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:19,120
- Shall we?
- After you, doctor.

435
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,440
No, it's all right. I'm all right.

436
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,680
All right, let's go.

437
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,600
I don't need you.

438
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,640
Go back.

439
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,520
Mr. Waddington?

440
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:01,640
I'm looking for Mr. Waddington.

441
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:16,920
Wait here. All right?

442
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,400
Hello?

443
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,720
Mr. Waddington?

444
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:35,960
Mrs. Fane?

445
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:38,520
Good morning.

446
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,560
What can I do for you, Mrs. Fane?

447
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:48,520
I found a record for you.

448
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:53,720
Stravinsky. Very modern. Thank you.

449
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:58,360
Was there something else?

450
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:02,360
Yes. I was wondering if you could tell me
when the post comes through.

451
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:03,560
It's for Shanghai.

452
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,400
Unfortunately, since the cholera...

453
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:08,120
...the cowards won't venture
past the river port.

454
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,640
But leave it with me.

455
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:12,720
A local trader I know is making
the trip on Friday.

456
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:14,720
Townsend.

457
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,040
- Charlie Townsend?
- Yes.

458
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,160
He's an acquaintance of my husband.

459
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,200
- Do you know him?
- Years ago.

460
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:25,280
We were both assigned to
the consulate in Shanghai.

461
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:26,920
Charming wife.

462
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,600
Yes. They're very popular, aren't they?

463
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,960
He'd made a science of popularity.

464
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,680
- So you know his family?
- Well, well enough.

465
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:35,960
I like Dorothy.

466
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:40,320
Yes, I understand they're quite
the devoted couple.

467
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,560
Oh, he had his little flirtations.

468
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,240
Nothing serious.

469
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,720
I once heard her say
she found it most unflattering...

470
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:53,360
...that the women who fell for her husband
were so consistently second-rate.

471
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:02,160
Well, enjoy the record.

472
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,360
Mrs. Fane?

473
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:07,600
The letter.

474
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,000
Right.

475
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:13,280
Yes, it suddenly occurred to me
that Friday's much too late.

476
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,880
Thanks all the same.

477
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,600
Can you pass the salt, please?

478
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:46,960
I'm sorry, did you say something?

479
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,120
Could you pass the salt?

480
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,520
Thank you.

481
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:12,600
So this is how it's going to be.

482
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:16,600
Passing her evenings in silence.

483
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,240
Walter.

484
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,560
Walter.

485
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,640
I wonder if you haven't gone insane.

486
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,000
- She's not cooking it.
- Leave it.

487
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:43,360
Leave it.

488
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,560
Thank you.

489
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,440
Are you looking to kill yourself?

490
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,520
Town well's contaminated.

491
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,200
This is dirty. It's dirty.

492
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:26,000
What?

493
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,600
Mr. Waddington?

494
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:31,760
Mrs. Fane? Mrs. Fane?

495
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,880
Mrs. Fane?

496
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:38,520
Come away. Come away.

497
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:59,440
What's the matter with Te-Ming?

498
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,480
You have the dead man on you.

499
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,560
They're very superstitious, aren't they?

500
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:09,720
She's lost three children and a husband
to the cholera.

501
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:12,520
So you can hardly blame her.

502
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:33,480
You know, this is no place for a woman.

503
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:44,440
When they telegraphed me that
you were coming out, I was astonished.

504
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:49,360
I imagined you might be
a grim-visaged old nurse...

505
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:51,960
...with thick legs and a moustache.

506
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:56,880
I came into the bungalow
and there you were...

507
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:03,000
...frail and tired and very unhappy.

508
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,000
It was a long journey.

509
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,680
But you're unhappy now.

510
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:14,040
And it occurred to me that you
and your husband might be madly in love...

511
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:17,120
...and you'd simply refused
to stay behind.

512
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:20,320
- That's a reasonable explanation.
- Yes.

513
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,520
But it's not the right one.

514
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:26,920
Do you know what I find strange?

515
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,440
That your husband should never
look at you.

516
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:35,480
He looks at the walls, the floor,
his shoes.

517
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:39,560
He has a great deal on his mind.

518
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,440
Yes, I'm sure of it.

519
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:47,080
Dr. Fane?

520
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,040
Dr. Fane?

521
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,160
Oh, God.

522
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:55,200
All right.

523
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:26,560
What are you doing?

524
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:31,600
Martini?

525
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,320
Yes?

526
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:50,720
I'm the bearer of a message
from the Mother Superior.

527
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:55,680
Who?

528
00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:00,920
The nun who supervises
the orphanage and the hospital.

529
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,840
I didn't know she was aware
of my existence.

530
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:10,400
Well, apparently,
Mr. Waddington has spoken of you.

531
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:15,320
She would very much like to meet
the loving, loyal wife...

532
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,240
...of the compassionate Dr. Fane.

533
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:20,840
Right. Then I must prepare myself
for the charade.

534
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:24,160
She does understand if you...

535
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:27,720
...don't want to venture into
the center of the epidemic.

536
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:30,040
If you're not afraid, why should I be?

537
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:31,760
I forgot.

538
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,880
Walter? Oh, my God.

539
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:39,880
You're drunk.

540
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:37,520
Don't expect anything grand.
They're miserably poor.

541
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:58,040
Hello.

542
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:00,360
It is a great pleasure to make
the acquaintance...

543
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:02,960
...of the wife of
our good and brave doctor.

544
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:04,640
Lovely to meet you too.

545
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,000
Mr. Waddington.

546
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:09,640
You must eat the madeleine.

547
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,520
Sister St. Joseph made them for you
herself this morning.

548
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:21,240
So tell me, Mrs. Fane...

549
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:24,320
...to which faith do you subscribe?

550
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,400
Excuse me.

551
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:35,640
We attended services.
Not religiously... Regularly.

552
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:38,800
You could say I'm a member
of the Church of England.

553
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:41,920
Which is an inoffensive way of saying...

554
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:44,600
...you don't quite believe
in anything much.

555
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,880
You're very pretty.

556
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:49,760
And very young.

557
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:53,320
I assure you I'm not. I feel ancient.

558
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:00,840
If Mrs. Fane would like to see over
the convent and orphanage...

559
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,760
...I shall be glad to show her.

560
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:05,560
Alone.

561
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:22,640
We keep the older girls busy with sewing.
It keeps them occupied.

562
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,640
And earns money for the convent.

563
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:32,240
That one won't allow us to baptize her.

564
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:42,640
Our music room.

565
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:46,120
Sister Maryse.

566
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:09,480
Sister Dominique was our pianist.

567
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:13,520
She died last week. Cholera.

568
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:20,640
Through there is the infirmary.

569
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:25,160
It is not a sight one would wish to see.

570
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:28,960
Shall I call Dr. Fane out to see you?

571
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:31,720
No. You needn't disturb him.

572
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:36,840
Now, with the epidemic,
we have even more to care for.

573
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:40,080
This baby was brought in this morning.

574
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:41,680
Another orphan.

575
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:50,160
She says Dr. Fane loves babies.

576
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:55,000
He spends as much time as he can
helping them out in the nursery.

577
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:03,440
Mrs. Fane?

578
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,720
Mrs. Fane?

579
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,560
You all right?

580
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:10,160
Yes.

581
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:15,200
It's nothing, only foolishness.

582
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:12,840
What do you want?

583
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:15,360
Sorry.

584
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:19,840
- I brought you your supper.
- All right. Just leave it there.

585
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,080
Is there something else?

586
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:29,720
What's that you're doing?

587
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:37,480
I am testing the nitrate levels
of a local tomato.

588
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:39,800
Why?

589
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:41,920
Why?

590
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,480
Can't possibly interest you.

591
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:50,840
Well, enjoy your supper.

592
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:00,440
Walter.

593
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:05,880
What do you propose we should do
if we get through the epidemic?

594
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:07,600
I have no idea.

595
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:11,480
But I don't think any good will come of
talking about a situation we should forget.

596
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:14,360
- But you don't forget.
- Please. I really must work.

597
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:16,400
Won't you listen to what I have to say?

598
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:18,880
All right. If you insist.

599
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,720
It's just, today...

600
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:29,680
...having been at the convent,
with those nuns.

601
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:31,600
What have they done, converted you?

602
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:35,440
No. They spoke of you.

603
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,440
- And it made me feel...
- What?

604
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:39,840
It made you feel what?

605
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,280
- I think I've been afraid of you.
- Well, you should have been.

606
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,120
Excuse me.

607
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:49,520
If I can't work, I'm going to bed.

608
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:02,760
I know you're angry at me.

609
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:05,160
But if we could just try and talk about...

610
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:07,680
Honestly, I don't understand you.

611
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:09,320
What is it that you want from me?

612
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:12,480
Perhaps I just want us to be
a little less unhappy.

613
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:14,120
You're mistaken in thinking I am.

614
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:16,560
I have too much to do
to think of you very much.

615
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:19,720
That's exactly what I'm trying to say.
I feel useless.

616
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:21,680
What do you propose that I do
about that?

617
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:23,680
For God sakes,
will you stop punishing me?

618
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:28,800
Do you absolutely despise me?

619
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,240
- No. I despise myself.
- Why?

620
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:36,000
For allowing myself to love you once.

621
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:47,200
Hello.

622
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:52,360
I'm very well. And you?

623
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:56,840
For you. And you.

624
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:24,640
I hope I haven't come
at an inconvenient time.

625
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:27,400
Sister Maryse died last night.

626
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:29,960
I've just written to inform her parents.

627
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:31,160
I'm so sorry.

628
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:35,480
But it is sinful of me to grieve...

629
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:39,560
...when I know that her good and
simple soul has flown straight to heaven.

630
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:42,800
How can I help you?

631
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:47,520
Well, I'm sure that
with the sister's death...

632
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:50,120
...you must be even more short-handed.

633
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:55,280
You see, I was wondering if I could
come to the convent...

634
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:59,280
...and do anything, just...
Just to help out.

635
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:01,880
My dear child, don't you think
you've done enough...

636
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:03,560
...coming here with your husband?

637
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:05,720
I've been here a month...

638
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:09,000
...and, believe me, I have nothing to do
from morning till night.

639
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:12,360
Perhaps I could help with the sisters
in the hospital.

640
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:14,240
That is impossible.

641
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:16,320
Cholera is a terrible thing to see.

642
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:18,680
Besides, what would happen
if you should fall ill?

643
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:20,760
I'd be happy to scrub the floors.

644
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:24,720
Anything. Just something to feel useful.

645
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,840
That will not be necessary.

646
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,400
The orphans scrub the floors.

647
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:33,400
No, no, it is our business
and our privilege to do such things.

648
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:39,720
But there is always more to do each day.

649
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:43,280
Have you spoken to your husband
of your wish?

650
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:45,320
Yes.

651
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:58,480
I don't know what you're saying.

652
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:10,240
I also found traces in the river,
downstream from the burial grounds.

653
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:13,240
- You've checked these results?
- I tested it three times.

654
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:18,040
Well, that's it, then.

655
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:21,760
I would recommend barricading
the bathing area.

656
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:23,680
Cut off all access to the river.

657
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:26,120
How far do you expect people to walk
for water?

658
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:31,080
I've no idea. Upriver, at least a half-mile
above the burial ground.

659
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:33,840
- That's too far.
- Nevertheless.

660
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:38,040
I agree with Dr. Fane. It's necessary.

661
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:41,080
Also, I thought we'd agreed
to post a directive...

662
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:43,200
...to dispose of the corpses immediately.

663
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:44,520
We've done that already.

664
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:46,840
If you don't enforce it,
then it doesn't matter.

665
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:48,600
Families are hiding bodies for days.

666
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:51,240
- They bury them too close to the river.
- I understand.

667
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,000
You don't have to explain it twice.

668
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,960
Colonel, I respectfully request...

669
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:00,960
...that you order your soldiers
to enter these people's homes...

670
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:03,600
...and remove the bodies by force
if necessary.

671
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:10,640
It's all right.

672
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:37,000
Hello.

673
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:55,080
I understand.

674
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:58,080
The spirits need access to the water.
I understand that.

675
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:01,280
I just want to move a few of these
so they don't live in the water.

676
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:10,120
He said they're under the protection
of their warlord.

677
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:13,600
If he wants to move the bodies,
he will send his own soldiers.

678
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:26,520
It isn't the best time for a Western woman
to explore a Chinese town by herself.

679
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:29,040
Oh, do be quiet.

680
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:32,520
As if you care whether I'm killed
by nationalists or boredom.

681
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:35,760
Besides, I wasn't alone.

682
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:39,080
I was with my gallant protector,
Sung Ching.

683
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:45,000
By the way,
you might be happy to know...

684
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:48,560
...that I am just as useless to the nuns
as I am to you.

685
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:53,880
I shut off the town's
only water supply today.

686
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:58,680
What will you do?

687
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,760
I have no idea.

688
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,280
Then I suppose we're both useless.

689
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:16,640
At last, something in common.

690
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:36,480
Dr. Fane. We've both been
caught out in the weather.

691
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:37,840
Not now, sorry.

692
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:40,120
I beg your pardon?

693
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:42,800
- Counting.
- Counting?

694
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:00,760
We'll camp here tonight.

695
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:09,800
What makes you think
this warlord will cooperate?

696
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:12,320
I don't think he will.

697
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:14,680
So, what do you plan to say
to persuade him?

698
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:16,280
I don't know.

699
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:24,000
These men are like animals.
They have no vision.

700
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:27,040
They only have hunger and strength.

701
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:32,920
Men like this have held the real power
in China since I was young.

702
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:36,160
But that time is coming to an end.

703
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:39,720
There's no place for them
in the new China.

704
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:44,280
I don't think you like my being here
very much either, do you?

705
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:48,040
I think China belongs
to Chinese people...

706
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:51,120
...but the rest of the world
seems to disagree.

707
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:53,680
Yes, but that's got
nothing to do with me.

708
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:58,080
I didn't come here with a gun, you know.
I came with a microscope.

709
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:00,240
I believe you.

710
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:05,400
But it would be nice
to do this work together...

711
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:08,760
...without your country's guns
pointing at our people.

712
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Our plan is to divert
the water to the town...

713
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:20,880
...from the fields upriver,
above the burial grounds.

714
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:23,840
With your permission
and the assistance of your troops...

715
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,160
...the graves will be moved away
from the water...

716
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:29,920
...and Colonel Yu and his men will
enforce the prompt burial of the dead.

717
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:32,280
Maintaining the integrity
of the water sources...

718
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:34,920
...and enforcing proper sanitation
over the next weeks...

719
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:38,480
...will make a difference between
a few more deaths and possibly thousands.

720
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:07,880
He said no.

721
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:13,280
He doesn't speak any English, does he?

722
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:22,880
Tell him that's the most ridiculous suit
that I've ever seen.

723
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:41,120
I'm sorry.

724
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:46,880
Do not stop on my account
if Dr. Fane is enjoying himself.

725
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:48,600
No. No, not at all.

726
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:51,280
No, l... It's very nice.
I just... I was passing.

727
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:53,240
- No. Stay.
- I should go.

728
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:54,480
I insist.

729
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:02,560
- All right, if you like.
- Continue, Mrs. Fane.

730
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:07,400
But perhaps something
a little more soothing.

731
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:09,160
Yes, of course.

732
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:28,240
They brought in a new baby today.

733
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:33,120
The girls named her Zan Xien.
It means "brand-new."

734
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:37,760
The nuns are going to call it Katherine,
which, of course...

735
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:40,200
...none of the girls will be able to say.

736
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:46,800
Thank goodness for those nuns.
They do so much for so little in return.

737
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:49,800
I suppose you could look at it that way.

738
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:51,800
You suppose?

739
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:55,920
I think it might be
a bit more complicated than that.

740
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:59,720
They take in desperate children
and give them a chance at life.

741
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:01,720
What could be so complicated about that?

742
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:05,320
They also go to young mothers
in their homes.

743
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:07,960
They ask them to give their babies
to the convent.

744
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:12,400
They offer them money to support
their families to persuade them to do it.

745
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:15,240
They're not just here
to run an orphanage, your nuns.

746
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:17,720
They're turning those children
into little Catholics.

747
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:22,480
None of us are in China without a reason.

748
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:24,040
Still, on the whole...

749
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:28,040
...I think that what they're doing
is a pretty good deed, don't you?

750
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:29,360
I'm here to study bacteria.

751
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:31,920
I don't feel a need
to have an opinion about the rest.

752
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:34,080
Well, I do, and I admire them.

753
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:38,800
I don't think it has to be
so complicated and gloomy.

754
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:48,720
And I think what you're doing,
for instance, is incredibly noble.

755
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:51,920
You used to feel contempt for me.
Don't you still?

756
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:55,080
Walter. I can't believe that you,
with all your cleverness...

757
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:57,680
...should have
such little sense of proportion.

758
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:02,560
We humans are more complex
than your silly little microbes.

759
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:06,480
We're unpredictable.
We make mistakes and we disappoint.

760
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:09,320
- Yes, we certainly do.
- I'm sorry.

761
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:13,480
I'm sorry I'm not the perfect young woman
that you want me to be.

762
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:16,000
I'm just ordinary.

763
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:20,480
I never tried to pretend
that I was anything else.

764
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:29,120
No, you certainly didn't.

765
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:34,760
I like the theater, and dancing...

766
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:39,240
...and playing tennis. I like games.
I like men who play games.

767
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:41,720
God forgive me,
that's the way I was brought up.

768
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:43,560
I play a pretty fierce hand of bridge.

769
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:46,640
Oh, well, that's bloody exciting.

770
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:53,480
And you, you dragged me around
all those interminable galleries in Venice...

771
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:56,480
...blathering on about
the miracle of the canals...

772
01:19:56,640 --> 01:20:00,960
...and the flushing of the lagoon system,
or some such nonsense.

773
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:04,160
Honestly, I'd have been much happier
playing golf at Sandwich.

774
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:12,800
I suppose you're right.

775
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:17,680
It was silly of us to look for qualities
in each other that we never had.

776
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:20,480
Yes.

777
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:22,960
Yes, it was.

778
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:28,960
Walter?

779
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:36,520
Why didn't you break down that door
when you knew I was in there with Charlie?

780
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:41,120
You might have at least
tried to thrash him.

781
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:43,760
He wasn't worth it.

782
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:49,760
Or maybe I'm just too proud to fight.

783
01:20:51,320 --> 01:20:53,400
I don't know about that.

784
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:23,040
I've told Mother Superior
to keep her sisters inside the convent.

785
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:24,800
I put a guard outside the gate.

786
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:29,400
- I'd advise any Westerners to stay indoors.
- All right.

787
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,240
Sister, has Mrs. Fane
been at the convent today?

788
01:21:40,360 --> 01:21:44,200
Oui, doctor.
But she has left a few minutes ago.

789
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:11,440
Sung Ching.

790
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,280
Let's go. Let's go!

791
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:18,400
Let's go!

792
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:23,760
Stop it!

793
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:51,360
Sung Ching! Where's Mrs. Fane?
Where's Mrs. Fane?

794
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:08,160
I don't know what you're saying!

795
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:09,560
Get away from her.

796
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:12,480
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

797
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:29,440
Come on.

798
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,200
We're out of whiskey.

799
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:28,640
Dr. Fane.

800
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:30,960
Could I trouble you for a drink?

801
01:24:57,480 --> 01:24:59,280
Hello, darling.

802
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:19,320
I was stationed at Hankow
during the revolution...

803
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:22,120
...when they were massacring
all the Manchus.

804
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:27,520
I was able to help a particular family.
New documents, that sort of thing.

805
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:30,960
She was the youngest of the daughters.

806
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:35,680
I didn't pay her
too much attention at first.

807
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:39,760
Well, more than I should have, I suppose.

808
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:43,960
When I left Hankow, she followed me.

809
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:51,640
I sent her back two, three times,
but she kept coming back.

810
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:59,760
I didn't realize you had
so much affection for her.

811
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:02,120
What makes you think I do?

812
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:06,800
I can see it in your eyes.

813
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:12,280
Men are incalculable.

814
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:15,560
I thought you were
just like everybody else...

815
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:18,320
...and now I feel I don't know
the first thing about you.

816
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:25,680
I wonder what she sees in you.

817
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:28,280
Wan Xi.

818
01:26:37,720 --> 01:26:40,880
She says I'm a good man.

819
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:53,200
As if a woman ever loved a man
for his virtue.

820
01:30:28,440 --> 01:30:29,880
Morning.

821
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:39,520
Morning.

822
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:47,000
I should think it best
to stay away from town today.

823
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:48,400
All right.

824
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:11,040
I'm going for a walk.

825
01:31:16,280 --> 01:31:17,720
Come on, then.

826
01:31:59,640 --> 01:32:01,880
What on earth are you doing
all the way out here?

827
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,320
Walking off a crippling hangover.

828
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:06,120
What are you doing?

829
01:32:06,280 --> 01:32:08,920
Well, I've been attempting to purchase
a stalk of bamboo...

830
01:32:09,080 --> 01:32:12,360
...off this fine gentleman here,
but his price is exorbitant.

831
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:15,880
My head is too shattered to negotiate.

832
01:32:22,240 --> 01:32:25,840
- So would you like a ride home?
- On what?

833
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:27,800
The buffalo?

834
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:17,520
You see, we're diverting it
from these fields temporarily...

835
01:33:17,680 --> 01:33:20,800
...sending it into the center of town,
where they can get at it easily.

836
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:23,920
It's over a half-mile.
It gave us a devil of a time in some places.

837
01:34:54,920 --> 01:34:56,000
Oh, Mother.

838
01:34:58,360 --> 01:34:59,800
Am I going to die?

839
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:03,040
Come, come. You mustn't be so silly.

840
01:35:03,480 --> 01:35:06,800
Listen, ma chre.
Is it possible you are with child?

841
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:12,840
- No.
- Oh, yes.

842
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:14,040
- No.
- Yes.

843
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:16,680
I mean...

844
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:22,880
I suppose it's possible.

845
01:35:23,080 --> 01:35:26,840
- There is no doubt about it.
- Yes. Sister St. Joseph knew at once.

846
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:31,600
She comes from a large family,
so she has experience in these matters.

847
01:35:31,720 --> 01:35:32,920
I can't believe it.

848
01:35:33,280 --> 01:35:37,680
Why can't you believe it?
Having a child is so natural.

849
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:40,160
Yes.

850
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:43,120
Think how happy your husband will be.

851
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:04,440
And what's happened here?

852
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:06,280
- I'm all right.
- They said you fainted.

853
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:08,080
- I'm fine.
- Let me look at you.

854
01:36:08,200 --> 01:36:09,160
It's not cholera.

855
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:12,120
No. I don't think so.

856
01:36:12,280 --> 01:36:14,080
Did you feel nauseous? Or just faint?

857
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:17,720
Walter, stop.

858
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,240
I'm pregnant.

859
01:36:22,240 --> 01:36:23,600
A baby?

860
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:28,600
You're quite certain?

861
01:36:29,160 --> 01:36:30,160
Yes.

862
01:36:33,560 --> 01:36:35,320
Well, that's wonderful.

863
01:36:40,600 --> 01:36:43,040
How long do you think
you've been like this?

864
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:47,000
Two months.

865
01:36:48,200 --> 01:36:49,440
Maybe longer.

866
01:37:06,720 --> 01:37:08,000
Kitty.

867
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:12,840
Am I the father?

868
01:37:17,480 --> 01:37:19,720
I honestly don't know.

869
01:37:22,120 --> 01:37:23,640
I'm sorry.

870
01:37:30,360 --> 01:37:31,720
Well...

871
01:37:36,640 --> 01:37:39,000
...it doesn't matter now...

872
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:41,000
...does it?

873
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:43,240
No.

874
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:46,840
No, it doesn't.

875
01:38:46,440 --> 01:38:47,800
Dr. Fane?

876
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:49,920
Come with me.

877
01:39:05,560 --> 01:39:09,600
- What is this? Where are they coming from?
- The cholera spread south along the river.

878
01:39:09,800 --> 01:39:11,760
They have no doctors or facilities there.

879
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:14,800
They'll contaminate everything.
We've got to keep them outside town.

880
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:16,800
Dr. Fane.

881
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:30,440
Dr. Fane!

882
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:44,640
Stop. Stop. Stop.

883
01:39:47,640 --> 01:39:49,120
Stop here. We can help you here.

884
01:39:50,240 --> 01:39:52,840
Colonel, tell them not to go into town!
We'll help here!

885
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:22,240
Mrs. Fane.
Gather all the children in the music room.

886
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:25,040
Wait here.

887
01:40:26,640 --> 01:40:28,080
Let's go.

888
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:07,440
That boy, bring him here. Bring him in.

889
01:43:14,640 --> 01:43:18,240
I don't understand.
Why didn't he wake me?

890
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:22,480
He made an early start,
and you needed the rest.

891
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:28,920
- How far is the refugee camp?
- Just outside the town, in the foothills.

892
01:43:32,080 --> 01:43:36,000
Dr. Fane told me he wanted you to leave,
but you would not.

893
01:43:36,640 --> 01:43:38,720
I didn't want to leave you.

894
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:41,720
Yes, and we appreciate it, dear child.

895
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:44,360
But I think you did not want
to leave him either.

896
01:43:45,040 --> 01:43:47,800
Well, it's my duty.

897
01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:51,280
Duty is only washing your hands
when they are dirty.

898
01:43:55,160 --> 01:43:59,720
I fell in love when I was 17, with God.

899
01:43:59,880 --> 01:44:05,800
A foolish girl with romantic notions
about the life of a religious.

900
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:08,560
But my love was passionate.

901
01:44:10,760 --> 01:44:13,560
Over the years my feelings have changed.

902
01:44:14,240 --> 01:44:17,800
He's disappointed me. Ignored me.

903
01:44:18,400 --> 01:44:24,280
We've settled into a relationship
of peaceful indifference.

904
01:44:24,400 --> 01:44:29,480
The old husband and wife who sit
side by side on the sofa, but rarely speak.

905
01:44:31,160 --> 01:44:35,320
He knows I will never leave him.
This is my duty.

906
01:44:36,040 --> 01:44:41,880
But when love and duty are one,
then grace is within you.

907
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:50,320
Your soldier is waiting to take you back.

908
01:44:50,840 --> 01:44:53,600
- I'd rather stay.
- No.

909
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:10,720
What? What is it?

910
01:45:11,960 --> 01:45:12,920
What?

911
01:45:13,080 --> 01:45:14,120
Mrs. Fane?

912
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:16,800
Mr. Waddington?

913
01:45:17,920 --> 01:45:19,080
It's your husband.

914
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:20,640
What? What is it?

915
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:22,440
He's been taken ill.

916
01:45:42,200 --> 01:45:43,760
Where is he?

917
01:45:46,760 --> 01:45:48,320
Mrs. Fane.

918
01:45:55,800 --> 01:45:58,200
- Walter.
- Oh, no. She can't be here. It's not safe.

919
01:45:58,360 --> 01:46:01,200
- Waddington.
- I'm afraid I've got no say in the matter.

920
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:14,480
I don't want an audience.

921
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:16,960
You have to go.

922
01:46:17,680 --> 01:46:20,720
- Your baby.
- Please, you must go.

923
01:46:27,240 --> 01:46:29,800
Walter, tell me what I should do.

924
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:32,480
Slow that drip down.
It's running too fast.

925
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:33,960
Good, good.

926
01:46:34,160 --> 01:46:36,520
Kitty? Kitty.

927
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:42,720
It's going to get much worse
before it breaks.

928
01:46:43,880 --> 01:46:46,280
Are you prepared for this?

929
01:46:47,320 --> 01:46:48,800
Yes.

930
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:37,600
What is it?

931
01:47:41,360 --> 01:47:42,640
Can you send for more?

932
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:25,960
Kitty.

933
01:48:29,560 --> 01:48:31,120
Kitty.

934
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:35,880
Are you awake?

935
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:40,840
Are you feeling better?

936
01:49:03,280 --> 01:49:04,840
Forgive me.

937
01:49:08,360 --> 01:49:09,880
Forgive you?

938
01:49:15,840 --> 01:49:18,360
There's nothing to forgive.

939
01:49:39,320 --> 01:49:40,880
Walter...

940
01:49:42,720 --> 01:49:44,080
...l'm sorry.

941
01:50:13,280 --> 01:50:14,640
I'm so sorry.

942
01:50:16,640 --> 01:50:18,160
Mrs. Fane?

943
01:50:21,280 --> 01:50:24,160
Dr. Fane would want
to be buried immediately.

944
01:50:27,360 --> 01:50:28,400
Yes, of course.

945
01:51:41,080 --> 01:51:42,760
What are you doing?

946
01:53:22,520 --> 01:53:24,440
It's silly, really.

947
01:53:24,920 --> 01:53:26,640
They'll die in a week.

948
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:28,880
It's hardly worth the cost.

949
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:32,760
- What do you think?
- I think they're quite nice.

950
01:53:33,280 --> 01:53:34,200
Really?

951
01:53:35,800 --> 01:53:37,760
I think you're right.

952
01:53:39,480 --> 01:53:40,680
Come on.

953
01:53:43,240 --> 01:53:46,520
We better hurry. Grandfather's waiting.

954
01:53:49,480 --> 01:53:50,440
Kitty Fane?

955
01:53:54,160 --> 01:53:55,960
As I live and breathe.

956
01:53:56,120 --> 01:53:57,480
Hello, Charlie.

957
01:53:57,800 --> 01:53:59,880
What are you doing in London?

958
01:54:02,240 --> 01:54:04,720
I know it's been a long time.

959
01:54:05,760 --> 01:54:06,520
I should have written.

960
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,360
Who's this fine chap? Hello, young man.

961
01:54:12,520 --> 01:54:14,440
- What's your name?
- Walter.

962
01:54:14,600 --> 01:54:18,000
Hello, Walter. I'm Charlie Townsend.

963
01:54:19,440 --> 01:54:21,720
- How old are you?
- Five.

964
01:54:21,960 --> 01:54:23,120
- Five?
- Come on, darling.

965
01:54:23,640 --> 01:54:25,160
We should really press on.

966
01:54:25,320 --> 01:54:28,960
Yes, of course. Well, it's...

967
01:54:29,120 --> 01:54:30,320
...lovely seeing you again.

968
01:54:31,080 --> 01:54:32,120
And you.

969
01:54:33,320 --> 01:54:35,480
- Goodbye, Walter.
- Goodbye.

970
01:54:39,880 --> 01:54:41,200
Kitty.

971
01:54:42,280 --> 01:54:44,680
I'm in London for three weeks.
Perhaps we could...

972
01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:46,200
Goodbye, Mr. Townsend.

973
01:54:47,720 --> 01:54:48,880
Goodbye, Mrs. Fane.

974
01:54:52,600 --> 01:54:54,000
Who was that, Mommy?

975
01:54:54,960 --> 01:54:57,320
No one important, darling.
