1
00:04:56,776 --> 00:05:01,486
If we look at the base of a brain
which has just been removed from a skull,

2
00:05:01,576 --> 00:05:05,535
there's very little of the midbrain
that we can actually see.

3
00:05:05,616 --> 00:05:08,767
Yet, as I demonstrated
in my lecture last week,

4
00:05:08,856 --> 00:05:14,726
if the under aspects of the temporal lobes
are gently pulled apart,

5
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:19,404
the upper portion of the stem
of the brain can be seen.

6
00:05:20,096 --> 00:05:24,692
This so-called brainstem
consists of the midbrain,

7
00:05:26,096 --> 00:05:29,975
a rounded protrusion called the pons,

8
00:05:31,016 --> 00:05:35,009
and a stalk tapering downwards
called the medulla oblongata

9
00:05:35,096 --> 00:05:38,725
which passes out of the skull
through the foramen magnum

10
00:05:38,816 --> 00:05:41,808
and becomes, of course, the spinal cord.

11
00:05:42,496 --> 00:05:45,090
Are there any questions before we proceed?

12
00:05:45,176 --> 00:05:47,406
I have one question, Dr Frankenstein.

13
00:05:50,096 --> 00:05:52,212
That's Fronkonsteen.

14
00:05:52,296 --> 00:05:54,173
I beg your pardon?

15
00:05:54,496 --> 00:05:57,966
My name. It's pronounced "Fronkonsteen".

16
00:05:58,056 --> 00:06:01,731
But aren't you the grandson
of the famous Dr Victor Frankenstein,

17
00:06:01,816 --> 00:06:06,606
who dug up freshly buried corpses
and transformed dead components into...

18
00:06:06,696 --> 00:06:08,288
Yes, yes.

19
00:06:08,376 --> 00:06:09,445
Yes.

20
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,527
We all know what he did.

21
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:16,967
But I'd rather be remembered
for my own small contributions to science

22
00:06:17,856 --> 00:06:21,212
and not because of my accidental
relationship

23
00:06:21,296 --> 00:06:24,527
to a famous... cuckoo.

24
00:06:28,336 --> 00:06:30,930
Now, if you don't mind,
can we have your question?

25
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:34,611
Well, sir, I'm not sure
I understand the distinction between

26
00:06:34,696 --> 00:06:37,256
reflexive and voluntary nerve impulses.

27
00:06:37,336 --> 00:06:41,409
Good. Since our lab work today
is a demonstration of just that distinction,

28
00:06:41,496 --> 00:06:43,885
why don't we proceed?

29
00:06:52,816 --> 00:06:56,047
Mr Hilltop here,
with whom I have never worked

30
00:06:56,136 --> 00:06:58,855
or given any prior instructions to,

31
00:06:58,936 --> 00:07:02,770
has graciously offered his services
for today's demonstration.

32
00:07:03,376 --> 00:07:07,608
Mr Hilltop, would you hop up on your feet
and stand beside this table?

33
00:07:17,016 --> 00:07:19,007
Nice hopping.

34
00:07:21,056 --> 00:07:23,047
Mr Hilltop,

35
00:07:23,456 --> 00:07:28,086
would you raise your left knee, please?

36
00:07:30,976 --> 00:07:34,173
You have just witnessed
a voluntary nerve impulse.

37
00:07:34,256 --> 00:07:37,214
It begins as a stimulus
from the cerebral cortex,

38
00:07:37,296 --> 00:07:40,652
passes through the brainstem
and to the muscles involved.

39
00:07:40,736 --> 00:07:42,966
Mr Hilltop, you may lower your knee.

40
00:07:43,056 --> 00:07:48,084
Reflex movements are those
which are made independently of the will,

41
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,326
but are carried out along pathways

42
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:54,728
which pass between the peripheral nervous
system and the central nervous system.

43
00:07:54,816 --> 00:07:57,933
You filthy, rotten, yellow son of a bitch.

44
00:07:58,016 --> 00:08:00,689
We are not aware of these impulses.

45
00:08:00,776 --> 00:08:04,530
Neither do we intend them
to carry out our contraction of muscles.

46
00:08:04,616 --> 00:08:07,005
Yet, as you can see, they work by themselves.

47
00:08:07,096 --> 00:08:11,248
But what if we block the nerve impulse
by simply applying local pressure,

48
00:08:11,336 --> 00:08:14,248
which can be done
with any ordinary metal clamp

49
00:08:14,336 --> 00:08:18,648
just at the swelling
on the posterior nerve roots

50
00:08:19,936 --> 00:08:23,451
for, say... five or six seconds?

51
00:08:28,136 --> 00:08:30,366
Why, you mother-grabbing bastard.

52
00:08:31,496 --> 00:08:34,408
As you can see,
all communication is shut off.

53
00:08:37,616 --> 00:08:40,449
In spite of our mechanical magnificence,

54
00:08:41,096 --> 00:08:45,931
if it were not for this continuous stream
of motor impulses,

55
00:08:46,016 --> 00:08:48,007
we would collapse

56
00:08:48,096 --> 00:08:51,293
like a bunch of broccoli.

57
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:58,725
In conclusion, it should be noted...

58
00:08:59,296 --> 00:09:02,129
- Give him an extra dollar.
- Extra dollar. Yes, sir.

59
00:09:02,216 --> 00:09:05,014
..that any more than common injury

60
00:09:05,096 --> 00:09:07,769
to the nerve root is always serious.

61
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:11,533
Because once a nerve fibre is severed,

62
00:09:11,616 --> 00:09:14,972
there is no way, in heaven or on earth,

63
00:09:15,936 --> 00:09:18,689
to regenerate life back into it.

64
00:09:18,776 --> 00:09:21,609
Are there any last questions before we leave?

65
00:09:21,696 --> 00:09:23,607
Dr Frank...

66
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:26,005
- Fronkonsteen...
- Yes?

67
00:09:26,096 --> 00:09:30,294
Isn't it true that Darwin preserved
a piece of vermicelli in a glass case

68
00:09:30,376 --> 00:09:32,571
until, by some extraordinary means,

69
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:36,126
it actually began to move
with a voluntary motion?

70
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:40,405
Are you speaking of the worm
or the spaghetti?

71
00:09:41,736 --> 00:09:43,727
Why, the worm, sir.

72
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:48,207
Yes. It seems to me I did read something
of that incident when I was a student.

73
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:51,766
But you have to remember that a worm,
with very few exceptions,

74
00:09:51,856 --> 00:09:54,734
is not a human being.

75
00:09:55,496 --> 00:09:58,647
But wasn't that the basis
of your grandfather's work, sir?

76
00:09:58,736 --> 00:10:00,727
The reanimation of dead tissue?

77
00:10:00,816 --> 00:10:04,286
My grandfather was a very sick man.

78
00:10:04,376 --> 00:10:08,449
But as a Fronkonsteen,
aren't you the least bit curious about it?

79
00:10:08,536 --> 00:10:12,768
Doesn't bringing back to life what was
once dead hold any intrigue for you?

80
00:10:12,856 --> 00:10:19,204
You are talking about the nonsensical ravings
of a lunatic mind. Dead is dead.

81
00:10:19,296 --> 00:10:22,015
But look at what has been done
with hearts and kidneys.

82
00:10:22,096 --> 00:10:27,409
Hearts and kidneys are Tinker toys.
I'm talking about the central nervous system.

83
00:10:27,496 --> 00:10:30,693
- But, sir...
- I am a scientist, not a philosopher!

84
00:10:30,776 --> 00:10:33,495
You have more chance
of reanimating this scalpel

85
00:10:33,576 --> 00:10:35,771
than of mending a broken nervous system.

86
00:10:35,856 --> 00:10:40,611
- But what about your grandfather's work?
- My grandfather's work was doo-doo!

87
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:44,452
I am not interested in death.

88
00:10:44,536 --> 00:10:48,131
The only thing that concerns me
is the preservation of life!

89
00:10:55,736 --> 00:10:57,567
Class...

90
00:10:57,656 --> 00:10:59,294
..is...

91
00:10:59,376 --> 00:11:01,367
..dismissed.

92
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:11,927
Dr Frankenstein...

93
00:11:13,216 --> 00:11:15,411
That's Fronkonsteen.

94
00:11:18,776 --> 00:11:21,131
My name is Gerhart Falkstein.

95
00:11:21,216 --> 00:11:26,415
I have travelled 5,000 miles to bring you
the will of your great-grandfather.

96
00:11:26,496 --> 00:11:31,047
Baron Beaufort von Frankenstein.

97
00:11:44,376 --> 00:11:46,367
Oh, my sweet darling.

98
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:50,335
Oh, my dearest love.
I'll count the hours that you're away.

99
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:54,204
- Oh, darling, so will l.
- Not on the lips.

100
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:58,528
I'm going to that party at Nanna and Nicky's.
I don't wanna smear my lipstick.

101
00:11:58,616 --> 00:12:00,254
- You understand.
- Of course.

102
00:12:00,336 --> 00:12:01,815
All aboard!

103
00:12:02,536 --> 00:12:05,369
- Oh, dear.
- Well, I guess this is it.

104
00:12:05,456 --> 00:12:07,367
Freddy, darling.

105
00:12:07,456 --> 00:12:11,574
Oh, how can I say in a few minutes
what it's taken me a lifetime to understand?

106
00:12:11,656 --> 00:12:13,647
- Won't you try?
- All right.

107
00:12:14,536 --> 00:12:16,527
You've got it, mister.

108
00:12:17,096 --> 00:12:20,452
I'm yours. All of me. What else can I say?

109
00:12:20,536 --> 00:12:23,608
- My sweet love...
- The hair. Just been set.

110
00:12:23,696 --> 00:12:25,607
Sorry.

111
00:12:26,256 --> 00:12:30,647
- I hope you like old-fashioned weddings.
- I prefer old-fashioned wedding nights.

112
00:12:30,736 --> 00:12:34,251
- You're incorrigible.
- Does that mean...

113
00:12:36,016 --> 00:12:39,133
- ..you love me?
- You bet your boots it does.

114
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:42,731
- Oh, my only love.
- Taffeta, darling.

115
00:12:43,136 --> 00:12:45,013
Taffeta, sweetheart.

116
00:12:45,096 --> 00:12:49,487
No, the dress is taffeta. It wrinkles so easily.

117
00:12:49,576 --> 00:12:51,009
All aboard!

118
00:12:51,096 --> 00:12:53,246
There's that horrid man again.

119
00:12:53,336 --> 00:12:56,134
Well, hurry now,
before I make a fool of myself.

120
00:12:56,216 --> 00:12:58,207
Oh, my nails!

121
00:12:58,296 --> 00:13:00,287
Sorry.

122
00:13:07,456 --> 00:13:09,890
- Goodbye, darling.
- Goodbye, Freddy.

123
00:13:15,296 --> 00:13:16,729
Darling.

124
00:13:39,096 --> 00:13:42,452
- Harry, he was at it again.
- So what do you want me to do about it?

125
00:13:42,536 --> 00:13:43,935
Every day.

126
00:13:44,016 --> 00:13:45,768
Let him. Let him.

127
00:13:45,856 --> 00:13:49,531
New York next. Everybody out for New York.

128
00:14:15,296 --> 00:14:18,413
Pardon me, boy.
Is this the Transylvania Station?

129
00:14:19,536 --> 00:14:21,686
Ja, ja. Track 29.

130
00:14:23,136 --> 00:14:25,127
Oh, can I give you a shine?

131
00:14:26,576 --> 00:14:28,567
No, thanks.

132
00:14:54,776 --> 00:14:56,767
Dr Frankenstein?

133
00:15:01,816 --> 00:15:03,249
Fronkonsteen.

134
00:15:05,096 --> 00:15:07,087
You're putting me on.

135
00:15:07,176 --> 00:15:09,406
No. It's pronounced Fronkonsteen.

136
00:15:10,296 --> 00:15:12,605
Do you also say Frodorick?

137
00:15:12,696 --> 00:15:14,687
No. Frederick.

138
00:15:14,776 --> 00:15:17,848
Well, why isn't it Frodorick Fronkonsteen?

139
00:15:17,936 --> 00:15:20,450
It isn't. It's Frederick Fronkonsteen.

140
00:15:20,536 --> 00:15:22,731
I see.

141
00:15:22,816 --> 00:15:26,206
- You must be Igor.
- No. It's pronounced I-gor.

142
00:15:27,616 --> 00:15:31,655
- But they told me it was Igor.
- Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?

143
00:15:32,616 --> 00:15:35,050
You were sent by Herr Falkstein, weren't you?

144
00:15:35,136 --> 00:15:38,970
Yes. My grandfather
used to work for your grandfather.

145
00:15:41,776 --> 00:15:44,734
- How nice.
- Of course, the rates have gone up.

146
00:15:44,816 --> 00:15:48,411
Of course. I'm sure we'll get along splendidly.

147
00:15:49,856 --> 00:15:52,416
Sorry. I...

148
00:15:53,136 --> 00:15:57,175
You know, I don't mean to embarrass you,
but I'm a rather brilliant surgeon.

149
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:59,690
Perhaps I could help you with that hump.

150
00:15:59,776 --> 00:16:01,767
What hump?

151
00:16:06,176 --> 00:16:08,053
Let's go.

152
00:16:08,136 --> 00:16:11,208
Allow me, master.

153
00:16:11,296 --> 00:16:13,287
Thanks very much.

154
00:16:16,936 --> 00:16:19,370
Walk this way.

155
00:16:21,096 --> 00:16:23,087
This way.

156
00:16:39,896 --> 00:16:43,093
I think you'll be more comfortable in the rear.

157
00:16:48,736 --> 00:16:51,489
- What was that?
- That'll be lnga.

158
00:16:51,576 --> 00:16:55,728
Herr Falkstein thought you might need
a laboratory assistant temporarily.

159
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:03,326
Hello.
Would you like to have a roll in the hay?

160
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:06,248
It's fun.

161
00:17:06,336 --> 00:17:09,726
Roll, roll, roll in the hay

162
00:17:31,816 --> 00:17:34,250
Sometimes I am afraid ofthe lightning.

163
00:17:34,336 --> 00:17:36,645
It's just an atmospheric discharge.

164
00:17:36,736 --> 00:17:38,727
Nothing to be afraid of.

165
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,887
Werewolf.

166
00:17:45,976 --> 00:17:47,967
Werewolf?

167
00:17:48,056 --> 00:17:50,047
- There.
- What?

168
00:17:50,856 --> 00:17:52,847
There wolf.

169
00:17:52,936 --> 00:17:54,927
There castle.

170
00:17:55,016 --> 00:17:57,007
Why are you talking that way?

171
00:17:57,096 --> 00:17:59,929
- I thought you wanted to.
- No, I don't want to.

172
00:18:00,816 --> 00:18:02,807
Suit yourself. I'm easy.

173
00:18:05,936 --> 00:18:07,415
Well...

174
00:18:07,496 --> 00:18:09,214
There it is.

175
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:11,287
Home.

176
00:18:42,376 --> 00:18:44,492
What knockers.

177
00:18:45,576 --> 00:18:47,532
Thank you, Doctor.

178
00:18:47,616 --> 00:18:50,005
Oh, that's all right.

179
00:18:50,936 --> 00:18:52,688
There we are.

180
00:19:04,976 --> 00:19:07,490
I am Frau Blucher.

181
00:19:11,576 --> 00:19:13,567
Steady!

182
00:19:15,056 --> 00:19:17,650
How do you do? I am Dr Fronkonsteen.

183
00:19:17,736 --> 00:19:21,251
This is my assistant.
Inga, may I present Frau Blucher?

184
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:27,335
I wonder what's got into them.

185
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:31,887
Your rooms have been prepared, HerrDoktor.

186
00:19:31,976 --> 00:19:34,536
Ifyou will follow me.

187
00:19:34,616 --> 00:19:37,608
I-gor. Would you bring the bags
as soon as you're finished, please?

188
00:19:37,696 --> 00:19:39,129
Yes, master.

189
00:19:39,216 --> 00:19:41,605
After you, Frau Blucher.

190
00:19:55,936 --> 00:19:58,086
Blucher!

191
00:20:14,096 --> 00:20:16,610
Follow me, please.

192
00:20:36,776 --> 00:20:38,767
Stay close to the candles.

193
00:20:38,856 --> 00:20:42,326
The staircase can be treacherous.

194
00:20:50,496 --> 00:20:54,887
Undthis is your room.
It was your grandfather Victor's room.

195
00:20:54,976 --> 00:20:56,967
I see.

196
00:20:58,136 --> 00:21:00,206
Well. Seem to be quite a few books.

197
00:21:00,336 --> 00:21:02,327
This was Victor's...

198
00:21:02,896 --> 00:21:05,774
..the Baron's medical library.

199
00:21:05,856 --> 00:21:09,929
- Where is my grandfather's private library?
- I don't know what you mean, sir.

200
00:21:10,016 --> 00:21:14,009
Well, these books are very general.
Any doctor might have them in his study.

201
00:21:14,096 --> 00:21:18,089
This is the only library I know of,
Dr Frankenstone.

202
00:21:18,936 --> 00:21:21,291
- Fronkonsteen.
- Fronkonsteen.

203
00:21:22,016 --> 00:21:24,405
Well, we'll see.

204
00:21:25,256 --> 00:21:27,247
Good night.

205
00:21:29,456 --> 00:21:32,812
Would the doctor care for
a brandy before retiring?

206
00:21:33,736 --> 00:21:36,330
No. Thank you.

207
00:21:38,376 --> 00:21:40,367
Some warm milk...

208
00:21:41,336 --> 00:21:43,133
..perhaps?

209
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:46,609
No, thank you very much.

210
00:21:46,696 --> 00:21:48,732
No, thanks.

211
00:21:48,816 --> 00:21:50,807
Ovaltine?

212
00:21:54,976 --> 00:21:56,728
Nothing.

213
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,568
Thank you.

214
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:00,965
I'm a little tired.

215
00:22:03,736 --> 00:22:05,806
Then I will say... good night.

216
00:22:05,896 --> 00:22:07,887
Good night!

217
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:26,249
Good night, darling.

218
00:22:29,536 --> 00:22:31,606
Good night, HerrDoktor.

219
00:22:31,696 --> 00:22:34,005
Good night, Frau Blucher.

220
00:22:54,696 --> 00:22:56,687
No, no, no...

221
00:22:58,096 --> 00:23:00,485
No, no, no...

222
00:23:04,696 --> 00:23:07,005
I'm not a Frankenstein.

223
00:23:08,176 --> 00:23:10,371
I am not a Frankenstein.

224
00:23:11,736 --> 00:23:13,727
I'm a Fronkonsteen.

225
00:23:14,456 --> 00:23:16,447
Don't gimme that!

226
00:23:16,536 --> 00:23:19,175
I don't believe in fate.

227
00:23:19,896 --> 00:23:21,887
And I won't say it.

228
00:23:23,216 --> 00:23:25,684
All right, you win. I give.

229
00:23:25,816 --> 00:23:28,284
I'll say it. I'll say it, I'll say it.

230
00:23:30,216 --> 00:23:32,332
Destiny. Destiny.

231
00:23:32,896 --> 00:23:35,205
No escaping that for me.

232
00:23:35,296 --> 00:23:37,366
Destiny. Destiny.

233
00:23:37,456 --> 00:23:39,731
No escaping that for me.

234
00:23:39,816 --> 00:23:41,932
Destiny. Destiny...

235
00:23:42,016 --> 00:23:44,007
No escaping...

236
00:23:45,616 --> 00:23:48,130
Dr Fronkonsteen. Wake up.

237
00:23:48,856 --> 00:23:52,485
- What is it?
- You were having a nightmare.

238
00:23:54,376 --> 00:23:57,288
- What's that strange music?
- I have no idea.

239
00:23:58,536 --> 00:24:00,527
But it seems to be coming

240
00:24:01,616 --> 00:24:03,971
from behind the bookcase.

241
00:24:05,456 --> 00:24:07,970
Behind the bookcase...

242
00:24:09,536 --> 00:24:11,686
Hand me that robe, would you, dear?

243
00:24:16,296 --> 00:24:19,413
You were right.
It's coming from behind this wall.

244
00:24:20,296 --> 00:24:21,729
Where is it?

245
00:24:21,816 --> 00:24:23,693
- Where is it?
- What?

246
00:24:23,776 --> 00:24:27,735
There's always a device.
If I can just spot the triggering mechanism...

247
00:24:27,816 --> 00:24:29,807
Hello.

248
00:24:39,776 --> 00:24:43,769
It seems louder over here.
Hand me that candle, will you?

249
00:24:47,976 --> 00:24:51,127
Put the candle back.

250
00:24:57,056 --> 00:25:01,015
All right. I think I have it figured out now.

251
00:25:01,096 --> 00:25:06,295
Take out the candle
and I'll block the bookcase with my body.

252
00:25:16,296 --> 00:25:18,935
Listen to me very carefully.

253
00:25:19,016 --> 00:25:22,167
Don't put the candle back.

254
00:25:22,696 --> 00:25:24,607
With all ofyour might,

255
00:25:24,696 --> 00:25:28,371
shove against the other side
ofthe bookcase.

256
00:25:28,816 --> 00:25:31,330
Is that perfectly clear?

257
00:25:32,496 --> 00:25:34,487
I think so.

258
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:44,647
Good girl.

259
00:25:45,696 --> 00:25:48,654
Put the candle back.

260
00:25:55,736 --> 00:25:58,170
Oh, look, Doctor. A passageway.

261
00:25:58,256 --> 00:26:01,214
Whatever that music is,
it's coming from down there.

262
00:26:01,296 --> 00:26:04,811
- I'd better take a look.
- Oh, let me come with you, Doctor, please.

263
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,887
I don't wanna stay up here alone.

264
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:09,888
All right, then.
Close your robe and follow me.

265
00:26:09,976 --> 00:26:11,967
Oh, Doctor. The candle...

266
00:26:12,736 --> 00:26:15,330
Good thinking. Let's try this one.

267
00:26:16,536 --> 00:26:18,527
Stand back!

268
00:26:50,456 --> 00:26:52,845
Don't be frightened, dear. Just a rat.

269
00:26:53,576 --> 00:26:55,931
A filthy, slimy rat.

270
00:27:30,456 --> 00:27:32,447
Good Lord!

271
00:27:51,176 --> 00:27:52,814
I-l-l-l-l-l

272
00:27:52,896 --> 00:27:55,205
Ain't got nobody

273
00:27:55,296 --> 00:27:58,606
And nobody cares for me

274
00:27:59,976 --> 00:28:01,455
- I-gor.
- Frodorick.

275
00:28:01,536 --> 00:28:03,527
How did you get here?

276
00:28:05,056 --> 00:28:08,890
Through the dumbwaiter. I heard
strange music from the upstairs kitchen

277
00:28:08,976 --> 00:28:11,206
and I just followed it down.

278
00:28:11,296 --> 00:28:14,254
Call it... a hunch.

279
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:18,735
- There must have been someone else here.
- It would seem that way.

280
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:21,569
And there's the only other door.

281
00:28:21,656 --> 00:28:23,647
Wait, master.

282
00:28:23,736 --> 00:28:25,727
It might be dangerous.

283
00:28:26,536 --> 00:28:28,527
You go first.

284
00:28:39,416 --> 00:28:41,805
Aren't there any lights in this place?

285
00:28:42,816 --> 00:28:47,287
Two nasty-looking switches over here,
but I'm not going to be the first.

286
00:28:52,216 --> 00:28:54,207
Damn your eyes.

287
00:28:54,296 --> 00:28:56,287
Too late.

288
00:29:08,576 --> 00:29:11,568
So this is where it all happened.

289
00:29:22,216 --> 00:29:26,846
Just think. A deadbrain
ready to live again in a newbody.

290
00:29:27,416 --> 00:29:30,294
Look. No blood, no decomposition.

291
00:29:30,376 --> 00:29:32,367
Justa fewsutures.

292
00:29:32,456 --> 00:29:35,050
- Throw the main switch.
- Yes, master.

293
00:29:41,576 --> 00:29:43,851
What a filthy mess.

294
00:29:43,936 --> 00:29:47,611
I dunno. A little paint, a few flowers,
couple ofthrow pillows...

295
00:29:51,496 --> 00:29:56,047
Well, it seems as if our mysterious violinist
has disa...p...

296
00:29:56,136 --> 00:29:58,809
- Disa... what?
- ..peared.

297
00:29:58,896 --> 00:30:02,491
There is a light
coming from behind that door.

298
00:30:04,776 --> 00:30:06,767
Follow me.

299
00:30:33,416 --> 00:30:35,407
Doctor, look!

300
00:30:37,176 --> 00:30:40,691
Well... This explains the music.

301
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:44,087
It's still warm.

302
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:46,087
But who was playing it?

303
00:30:46,176 --> 00:30:47,689
I don't know.

304
00:30:47,776 --> 00:30:51,451
But whoever it was just barely finished
putting out his cigar.

305
00:30:51,536 --> 00:30:54,096
Such strange goings-on.

306
00:30:56,456 --> 00:30:58,447
What is this place?

307
00:30:58,536 --> 00:31:00,925
Music room?

308
00:31:01,016 --> 00:31:03,928
But there's nothing here
but books and papers.

309
00:31:04,416 --> 00:31:06,407
Books and papers?

310
00:31:07,216 --> 00:31:08,615
It is!

311
00:31:08,696 --> 00:31:11,972
This is my grandfather's private library.
I feel it.

312
00:31:13,336 --> 00:31:15,327
Look! Look at this.

313
00:31:29,136 --> 00:31:33,971
"..until, from the midst ofthis
darkness, a sudden light broke in upon me."

314
00:31:34,936 --> 00:31:39,214
"A light so brilliant and wondrous,
and yet so simple."

315
00:31:40,296 --> 00:31:42,730
"Change the poles from plus to minus

316
00:31:43,736 --> 00:31:46,569
and from minus to plus."

317
00:31:50,136 --> 00:31:54,254
"I alone succeeded in discovering
the secret of bestowing life."

318
00:31:54,896 --> 00:31:56,727
"Nay, even more..."

319
00:31:56,816 --> 00:32:01,890
"I myself became capable
of bestowing animation

320
00:32:02,696 --> 00:32:05,005
upon lifeless matter."

321
00:32:11,896 --> 00:32:15,013
It could work.

322
00:32:31,976 --> 00:32:34,490
- Kipper?
- Thank you, Doctor.

323
00:32:39,896 --> 00:32:43,093
"As the minuteness ofthe parts
formed a hindrance to my speed,

324
00:32:43,176 --> 00:32:48,614
I resolved therefore
to make the creature of a gigantic stature."

325
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:52,808
Of course.

326
00:32:52,896 --> 00:32:54,966
That would simplify everything.

327
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,614
In other words,

328
00:32:56,696 --> 00:33:01,372
his veins, his feet, his hands, his organs
would all have to be increased in size.

329
00:33:01,456 --> 00:33:03,367
Exactly.

330
00:33:04,176 --> 00:33:06,815
He would have an enormous Schwanzstuck.

331
00:33:12,536 --> 00:33:14,686
That goes without saying.

332
00:33:14,776 --> 00:33:16,175
Woof.

333
00:33:17,136 --> 00:33:19,570
He's gonna be very popular.

334
00:33:20,376 --> 00:33:25,655
So then. What we're aiming for is a being
approximately seven feet in height,

335
00:33:25,736 --> 00:33:30,526
with all features either congenitally
or artificially proportionate in size.

336
00:33:30,616 --> 00:33:32,413
Something like...

337
00:33:32,856 --> 00:33:34,892
..this?

338
00:33:38,936 --> 00:33:40,688
Hello...

339
00:33:40,776 --> 00:33:42,767
You've caught something there.

340
00:33:42,856 --> 00:33:46,326
Crude, yes, primitive, yes,
perhaps even grotesque,

341
00:33:46,416 --> 00:33:49,089
yet something inexplicable tells me

342
00:33:49,896 --> 00:33:54,048
that this might be our man.

343
00:34:09,496 --> 00:34:11,487
All right, all right.

344
00:34:11,576 --> 00:34:14,010
That's good enough for the likes of 'im.

345
00:34:30,336 --> 00:34:32,327
Get down, you fool.

346
00:34:40,376 --> 00:34:42,367
Now.

347
00:35:10,176 --> 00:35:12,167
What a filthyjob.

348
00:35:12,616 --> 00:35:14,846
- Could be worse.
- How?

349
00:35:14,936 --> 00:35:16,927
Could be raining.

350
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:04,371
Quick.

351
00:36:08,536 --> 00:36:10,413
Need a hand?

352
00:36:10,496 --> 00:36:13,966
No, thanks. I have one.
Thanks very much all the same.

353
00:36:14,056 --> 00:36:15,694
Just a moment, sir.

354
00:36:15,776 --> 00:36:19,485
I know everyone around here,
but I've never seen your face before.

355
00:36:19,576 --> 00:36:21,567
Can you account for yourself?

356
00:36:21,656 --> 00:36:25,649
Yes. I am Dr Frederick Fronkonsteen,
newly arrived from America.

357
00:36:25,736 --> 00:36:28,330
Oh, yes, sir. I was told you were here.

358
00:36:28,416 --> 00:36:31,567
Well, I'm Constable Henry, sir.
Pleased to meet you.

359
00:36:33,216 --> 00:36:35,525
How very nice to meet you, Constable.

360
00:36:35,616 --> 00:36:38,528
Why, you're chilled to the bone, sir.

361
00:36:38,616 --> 00:36:41,528
A nice, warm fire would be the thing for you.

362
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:44,892
A little nip from the old bottle
wouldn't be too bad either, sir.

363
00:36:44,976 --> 00:36:47,171
That's the ticket, yes.

364
00:36:47,256 --> 00:36:50,692
Well, ifyou have everything in hand, sir,
I'll say good night.

365
00:36:50,776 --> 00:36:52,767
Thank you very much, Constable.

366
00:36:52,856 --> 00:36:55,768
At your service, sir, always.

367
00:36:57,576 --> 00:37:00,249
- Good night, Constable.
- Good night, sir.

368
00:37:16,936 --> 00:37:19,689
Oh, what an awesome sight.

369
00:37:21,016 --> 00:37:24,611
What a profound and reverend night is this.

370
00:37:25,856 --> 00:37:28,131
With such a specimen for a body,

371
00:37:28,696 --> 00:37:32,894
all we need now is
an equally magnificent brain.

372
00:37:34,816 --> 00:37:37,649
- You know what to do?
- I have a pretty good idea.

373
00:37:37,736 --> 00:37:39,727
Good man.

374
00:37:40,376 --> 00:37:43,607
Didn't you... Didn't you use to have that
on the other side?

375
00:37:43,696 --> 00:37:45,687
- What?
- Your...

376
00:37:46,576 --> 00:37:48,567
Never mind.

377
00:37:52,096 --> 00:37:55,611
- Do you have that name I gave you?
- I have it written down.

378
00:37:56,736 --> 00:38:00,934
- H Delbruck.
- Hans Delbruck.

379
00:39:49,016 --> 00:39:52,645
- He is hideous.
- He's beautiful.

380
00:39:53,736 --> 00:39:57,092
And he is mine.

381
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:07,489
Hurry now.
We're fighting time and the elements.

382
00:40:07,576 --> 00:40:11,489
- Are you ready?
- Are you sure this is how they did it?

383
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:14,090
Yes. It's all written down in the notes.

384
00:40:14,176 --> 00:40:17,168
Now tie offthe kites
and hurry down as fast as you can.

385
00:40:17,256 --> 00:40:18,689
What's the hurry?

386
00:40:18,776 --> 00:40:22,564
There's a possibility of electrocution.
Do you understand?

387
00:40:26,216 --> 00:40:29,970
I say: "There's a possibility of electrocution."

388
00:40:30,496 --> 00:40:32,851
Do you understand?

389
00:40:32,936 --> 00:40:35,848
I understand, I understand.
Why are you shouting?

390
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,568
Did you...

391
00:40:39,496 --> 00:40:42,294
- Did you tie offthe kites?
- Of course.

392
00:40:43,576 --> 00:40:45,567
All right. Good.

393
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:50,455
- Check the generator.
- Yes, master.

394
00:40:57,896 --> 00:40:59,124
I-gor,

395
00:40:59,216 --> 00:41:02,526
- release the safety valve on the main wheel.
- Yes, master.

396
00:41:08,336 --> 00:41:12,693
Can you imagine the brain
of Hans Delbruck in this body?

397
00:41:12,776 --> 00:41:14,687
Oh, Frederick.

398
00:41:15,176 --> 00:41:17,167
This is the moment.

399
00:41:18,096 --> 00:41:20,087
Well, dear...

400
00:41:20,176 --> 00:41:22,167
Are you ready?

401
00:41:22,256 --> 00:41:24,247
Yes, Doctor.

402
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:27,607
Elevate me.

403
00:41:28,296 --> 00:41:30,287
Now? Right here?

404
00:41:32,016 --> 00:41:35,691
- Yes, yes. Raise the platform.
- Oh, the platform.

405
00:41:35,776 --> 00:41:37,971
Oh, that. Ja... yes.

406
00:41:56,336 --> 00:42:00,693
From that fateful day
when stinking bits of slime

407
00:42:00,776 --> 00:42:05,292
first crawled from the sea
and shouted to the cold stars:

408
00:42:05,896 --> 00:42:08,456
"I am man",

409
00:42:09,736 --> 00:42:14,287
our greatest dread has always been
the knowledge of our own mortality.

410
00:42:15,016 --> 00:42:17,007
But tonight

411
00:42:17,096 --> 00:42:19,769
we shall hurl the gauntlet of science

412
00:42:19,856 --> 00:42:23,326
into the frightful face of death itself.

413
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:27,567
Tonight,

414
00:42:27,776 --> 00:42:31,564
we shall ascend into the heavens.

415
00:42:32,136 --> 00:42:34,969
We shall mock the earthquake.

416
00:42:35,616 --> 00:42:38,084
We shall command the thunders

417
00:42:38,856 --> 00:42:40,847
and penetrate

418
00:42:40,936 --> 00:42:47,330
into the very womb
of impervious nature herself.

419
00:42:55,256 --> 00:42:58,885
When I give the word,
throw the first switch.

420
00:42:59,376 --> 00:43:01,367
You've got it, master.

421
00:43:05,296 --> 00:43:07,287
Get ready.

422
00:43:10,056 --> 00:43:11,933
Get set.

423
00:43:12,016 --> 00:43:13,768
Go!

424
00:43:19,496 --> 00:43:21,691
Throw the second switch.

425
00:43:26,056 --> 00:43:28,570
Throw the third switch.

426
00:43:28,656 --> 00:43:31,011
Not the third switch?

427
00:43:31,096 --> 00:43:34,054
Throw it, I say. Throw it!

428
00:43:45,576 --> 00:43:47,567
Life.

429
00:43:47,656 --> 00:43:50,170
Life, do you hear me?

430
00:43:50,256 --> 00:43:52,247
Give my creation

431
00:43:52,936 --> 00:43:55,325
Iife!

432
00:44:16,536 --> 00:44:18,970
Turn everything off and bring me down.

433
00:45:26,136 --> 00:45:28,127
Nothing.

434
00:45:28,536 --> 00:45:30,970
- Oh, Doctor. I'm sorry...
- No, no.

435
00:45:31,736 --> 00:45:34,455
Be of good cheer.

436
00:45:34,536 --> 00:45:37,334
If science teaches us anything,

437
00:45:37,416 --> 00:45:40,852
it teaches us to accept our failures

438
00:45:40,936 --> 00:45:43,370
as well as our successes

439
00:45:44,016 --> 00:45:47,292
with quiet dignity

440
00:45:48,736 --> 00:45:50,966
and grace.

441
00:46:00,736 --> 00:46:03,204
Son of a bitch, bastard. I'll get you for this.

442
00:46:03,296 --> 00:46:05,287
What did you do to me?

443
00:46:05,376 --> 00:46:08,971
- What did you do to me?
- Doctor, stop it!

444
00:46:09,056 --> 00:46:10,887
You'll kill him!

445
00:46:12,216 --> 00:46:13,808
I don't wanna live.

446
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:17,127
I do not want to live.

447
00:46:19,296 --> 00:46:21,890
Quiet dignity and grace.

448
00:46:22,816 --> 00:46:24,852
Mama!

449
00:46:26,216 --> 00:46:29,765
Oh, tosh! This man is different, I tell you.

450
00:46:29,856 --> 00:46:33,485
You can see that after you've
talked to him for five minutes.

451
00:46:35,416 --> 00:46:36,974
Yes?

452
00:46:38,456 --> 00:46:40,447
He's a Frankenstein!

453
00:46:40,536 --> 00:46:43,653
And they're all alike.

454
00:46:44,336 --> 00:46:46,770
It's in their blood. They can't 'elp it.

455
00:46:47,256 --> 00:46:49,850
All those scientists, they're all alike.

456
00:46:50,536 --> 00:46:52,527
They say they're working for us.

457
00:46:52,816 --> 00:46:56,695
What they really want is to rule the world.

458
00:47:02,976 --> 00:47:07,174
That's enough now. I will not have
this meeting become a free-for-all.

459
00:47:07,256 --> 00:47:10,009
These are very serious charges
you're making,

460
00:47:10,096 --> 00:47:14,965
and all the more painful to us, your elders,
because we still have nightmares

461
00:47:15,056 --> 00:47:17,650
from five times before.

462
00:47:18,376 --> 00:47:24,326
Now, we haven't heard from the one man
most qualified to judge the situation fairly.

463
00:47:25,856 --> 00:47:27,847
Inspector Kemp.

464
00:47:28,896 --> 00:47:31,205
Will you talk to us, please?

465
00:47:57,816 --> 00:48:01,286
A riot is an ugly thing

466
00:48:01,376 --> 00:48:05,608
undonce you get one started

467
00:48:05,696 --> 00:48:08,654
there is little chance of stopping it

468
00:48:09,416 --> 00:48:11,805
short of bloodshed.

469
00:48:12,696 --> 00:48:17,724
I think before we go around killing people,

470
00:48:17,856 --> 00:48:23,249
we had better make damn sure
of our evidence.

471
00:48:24,656 --> 00:48:26,647
Und...

472
00:48:30,776 --> 00:48:34,086
..we had better confirm the fact

473
00:48:34,176 --> 00:48:38,055
that young Frankenstein is indeed

474
00:48:38,136 --> 00:48:41,208
vollowing in his grandfather's vootstaps.

475
00:48:41,296 --> 00:48:42,411
What?

476
00:48:42,496 --> 00:48:45,374
Vollowing in his grandfather's vootstaps.
Vootstaps.

477
00:48:45,456 --> 00:48:46,889
Oh, footsteps.

478
00:48:46,976 --> 00:48:48,967
I think

479
00:48:49,056 --> 00:48:51,286
what is in order

480
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:57,886
is for me to pay a little visit
on the good doctor

481
00:48:58,456 --> 00:49:03,974
undto have a nice, quiet chat.

00:49:13,776 --> 00:49:16,973
Oh, Doctor. You mustn't do this to yourself.

485
00:49:18,056 --> 00:49:20,365
You've got to stop thinking about it.

486
00:49:20,976 --> 00:49:23,888
Why, look.
You haven't even touched your food.

487
00:49:25,856 --> 00:49:27,209
There.

488
00:49:28,456 --> 00:49:30,811
Now I've touched it. Happy?

489
00:49:32,456 --> 00:49:35,448
You know... I'll never forget my old dad.

490
00:49:36,376 --> 00:49:41,052
When these things would happen to him...
the things he'd say to me.

491
00:49:42,536 --> 00:49:44,492
What did he say?

492
00:49:44,576 --> 00:49:47,534
What the hell are you doin'
in the bathroom day and night?

493
00:49:47,616 --> 00:49:51,086
Why don't you get outta there
and give someone else a chance?

494
00:49:57,176 --> 00:50:00,168
Oh, maybe it's better this way.

495
00:50:00,256 --> 00:50:02,690
The poor lifeless hulk.

496
00:50:02,776 --> 00:50:05,688
Maybe it is better off dead.

497
00:50:23,936 --> 00:50:25,654
What is this?

498
00:50:25,736 --> 00:50:27,727
SchwarzwalderKirschtorte.

499
00:50:30,096 --> 00:50:34,726
Do you like it? I'm not partial to
desserts myself, but this is excellent.

500
00:50:34,816 --> 00:50:37,205
Who are you talking to?

501
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:41,808
To you. You just made a yummy sound,
so I thought you liked the dessert.

502
00:50:41,896 --> 00:50:44,933
I didn't make a yummy sound.
I just asked you what it is.

503
00:50:45,016 --> 00:50:48,133
- But you did. I just heard it.
- It wasn't me.

504
00:50:48,216 --> 00:50:50,207
It wasn't me.

505
00:50:50,296 --> 00:50:53,891
Well, now, look here.
If it wasn't you and it wasn't you...

506
00:51:15,456 --> 00:51:18,687
Alive. It's alive.

507
00:51:19,416 --> 00:51:22,010
It's alive!

508
00:51:24,496 --> 00:51:26,726
Stand back.

509
00:51:33,816 --> 00:51:36,376
Hello, there.

510
00:51:36,456 --> 00:51:39,414
I'm going to set you free.

511
00:51:41,616 --> 00:51:44,176
- Is the sedative ready?
- Yes, Doctor.

512
00:51:58,016 --> 00:52:00,007
I want you

513
00:52:00,736 --> 00:52:03,534
to sit up.

514
00:52:17,256 --> 00:52:21,044
Stand on your feet.

515
00:52:25,216 --> 00:52:27,446
You can do it.

516
00:52:36,576 --> 00:52:39,488
Now walk.

517
00:52:46,296 --> 00:52:48,571
Doctor, I'm frightened.

518
00:52:48,656 --> 00:52:50,726
Don't worry.

519
00:52:53,256 --> 00:52:55,247
Good.

520
00:52:57,016 --> 00:52:59,007
Good.

521
00:53:00,536 --> 00:53:02,811
What is it? What's the matter?

522
00:53:02,896 --> 00:53:05,410
Quick. Give him the...

523
00:53:05,496 --> 00:53:06,849
Quick. Give him the...

524
00:53:06,936 --> 00:53:09,131
What? Give him the what?

525
00:53:09,816 --> 00:53:13,206
Three syllables.
First syllable - sounds like...

526
00:53:13,296 --> 00:53:15,571
Head. Sounds like head.

527
00:53:15,936 --> 00:53:17,927
Bed... Said...

528
00:53:18,336 --> 00:53:19,769
Said.

529
00:53:19,856 --> 00:53:21,289
- Said.
- Said.

530
00:53:21,376 --> 00:53:23,332
Second syllable - Iittle word.

531
00:53:23,416 --> 00:53:25,008
This, that, the...

532
00:53:25,096 --> 00:53:26,768
A...

533
00:53:27,256 --> 00:53:29,247
- Said a...
- Said a...

534
00:53:29,776 --> 00:53:31,767
Dirty word. He said a dirty word.

535
00:53:32,496 --> 00:53:34,487
Sounds like...

536
00:53:34,576 --> 00:53:36,567
To give. Give.

537
00:53:36,776 --> 00:53:39,529
Said... Said a give... Give him a said a give.

538
00:53:40,256 --> 00:53:43,009
Oh, tive... tive... Sedative.

539
00:53:43,096 --> 00:53:45,087
On the nosey.

540
00:54:04,016 --> 00:54:06,007
Said a give?

541
00:54:13,736 --> 00:54:16,330
Oh, Frederick. Are you all right?

542
00:54:16,416 --> 00:54:18,532
Yes.

543
00:54:19,216 --> 00:54:23,050
- Would you excuse me for one minute, dear?
- Of course, Doctor.

544
00:54:23,576 --> 00:54:25,567
I-gor...

545
00:54:26,456 --> 00:54:29,209
- May I speak to you for a moment?
- Of course.

546
00:54:29,296 --> 00:54:31,366
- Sit down, won't you?
- Thank you.

547
00:54:34,576 --> 00:54:36,373
No, no. Up here.

548
00:54:36,936 --> 00:54:38,733
Thank you.

549
00:54:42,776 --> 00:54:45,734
Now, that brain that you gave me...

550
00:54:46,576 --> 00:54:49,215
Was it Hans Delbruck's?

551
00:54:51,136 --> 00:54:53,570
- No.
- Good.

552
00:54:55,576 --> 00:54:57,089
Would you mind telling me...

553
00:54:58,976 --> 00:55:02,935
..whose brain I did put in?

554
00:55:03,016 --> 00:55:07,612
- Then you won't be angry?
- I will not be angry.

555
00:55:08,376 --> 00:55:10,367
Abby someone.

556
00:55:10,976 --> 00:55:13,126
Abby someone...

557
00:55:13,216 --> 00:55:15,776
- Abby who?
- Abby Normal.

558
00:55:18,376 --> 00:55:20,571
Abby Normal...

559
00:55:20,976 --> 00:55:23,046
I'm almost sure that was the name.

560
00:55:26,936 --> 00:55:31,373
Are you saying that I put an abnormal brain

561
00:55:32,296 --> 00:55:35,606
into a seven-and-a-half-foot long,

562
00:55:36,656 --> 00:55:39,728
54-inch wide

563
00:55:41,496 --> 00:55:43,487
gorilla?

564
00:55:44,056 --> 00:55:46,729
Is that what you're telling me?

565
00:55:47,136 --> 00:55:49,047
Quick, quick. Give him the...

566
00:55:49,136 --> 00:55:50,967
What?

567
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:53,047
Three syllables, yes.

568
00:55:54,336 --> 00:55:56,406
I wonder who that could be at this hour.

569
00:56:02,576 --> 00:56:05,773
Inga, quick. See who that is.

570
00:56:05,976 --> 00:56:10,606
You... put that thing
back on the operating table.

571
00:56:11,576 --> 00:56:14,773
And strap him down tightly.

572
00:56:16,096 --> 00:56:19,088
- Where are you going?
- To wash up. I've got to look normal.

573
00:56:19,176 --> 00:56:21,451
We've all of us got to behave normally.

574
00:56:24,456 --> 00:56:26,094
Monsters!

575
00:56:30,936 --> 00:56:32,847
Excellent shot.

576
00:56:32,936 --> 00:56:37,373
This is the 20th century, Kemp.
Monsters are passe like ghosts and goblins.

577
00:56:37,456 --> 00:56:41,608
Not to the good people
ofthis village, HerrDoktor.

578
00:56:43,136 --> 00:56:44,615
To them

579
00:56:44,696 --> 00:56:47,574
he is a very real thing.

580
00:56:48,456 --> 00:56:53,894
Especially when...
there is a Frankenstein residing in this house.

581
00:57:08,176 --> 00:57:10,212
Nice grouping.

582
00:57:10,296 --> 00:57:12,287
Thank you.

583
00:57:14,616 --> 00:57:20,293
I wouldn't think an intelligent fellow like you
would fall for all this superstitious rot.

584
00:57:21,216 --> 00:57:25,812
It is not superstition that worries me,
HerrDoktor, but genes und

585
00:57:26,216 --> 00:57:27,854
chromosomes.

586
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:31,853
- Rubbish.
- Well, you might say, but this is

587
00:57:32,376 --> 00:57:33,889
Transylvania.

588
00:57:36,016 --> 00:57:37,893
Undyou are a

589
00:57:37,976 --> 00:57:39,329
Frankenstein.

590
00:57:42,096 --> 00:57:47,124
You... seem unusually upset
by this discussion.

591
00:57:47,216 --> 00:57:49,207
Not in the least.

592
00:57:49,976 --> 00:57:52,126
I find it extremely amusing, that's all.

593
00:57:54,856 --> 00:57:56,608
Well, this was fun.

594
00:57:56,696 --> 00:57:59,449
Now, ifyou don't mind, lnspector,
I'm a little tired.

595
00:57:59,536 --> 00:58:00,685
Then

596
00:58:00,776 --> 00:58:04,052
I may give the villagers
your complete assurance

597
00:58:04,656 --> 00:58:10,128
that you have no interest whatsoever
in carrying on your grandfather's work?

598
00:58:13,096 --> 00:58:15,087
May I take that for a yes?

599
00:58:16,736 --> 00:58:18,408
Very well.

600
00:58:18,496 --> 00:58:21,533
- You can find the way out by yourself?
- Of course.

601
00:58:22,696 --> 00:58:27,053
Until we meet again... HerrBaron.

602
00:58:27,136 --> 00:58:29,650
Yes. Drop by any time. We are always open.

603
00:59:10,936 --> 00:59:12,927
Oh, Victor.

604
00:59:13,536 --> 00:59:15,174
Victor...

605
00:59:15,256 --> 00:59:17,611
We have done it.

606
00:59:20,856 --> 00:59:23,245
I'm going to set you free.

607
00:59:23,336 --> 00:59:26,373
Would you like that, meine Seuchekopf?.

608
00:59:35,776 --> 00:59:37,767
They wanted to hurt you.

609
00:59:38,736 --> 00:59:40,727
But I'm going to help you.

610
00:59:42,256 --> 00:59:44,247
Thank heavens that's over with.

611
00:59:45,176 --> 00:59:47,167
Frau Blucher.

612
00:59:48,936 --> 00:59:51,404
Stop. Don't come closer.

613
00:59:51,496 --> 00:59:54,488
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to set him free.

614
00:59:54,576 --> 00:59:56,567
No. No, you mustn't.

615
00:59:56,656 --> 00:59:57,975
Yes.

616
00:59:58,936 --> 01:00:01,211
Are you insane? He'll kill you.

617
01:00:02,496 --> 01:00:04,851
No, he won't. Not this one.

618
01:00:04,936 --> 01:00:07,928
He is as gentle as a lamb.

619
01:00:08,016 --> 01:00:12,134
Stand back. Stand back.
For the love of God, he has a rotten brain.

620
01:00:12,696 --> 01:00:14,926
It's not rotten. It's a good brain.

621
01:00:15,016 --> 01:00:17,894
It's rotten, I tell you. Rotten.

622
01:00:18,776 --> 01:00:21,768
Ixnay on the ottenray.

623
01:00:21,856 --> 01:00:25,451
I'm not afraid. I know what he likes.

624
01:00:40,176 --> 01:00:42,167
That music.

625
01:00:42,256 --> 01:00:47,888
Yes. It's in your blood.
It's in the blood of all Frankensteins.

626
01:00:47,976 --> 01:00:51,889
It reaches the soul when words are useless.

627
01:00:51,976 --> 01:00:55,491
Your grandfather used to play it
to the creature he was making.

628
01:00:55,576 --> 01:00:58,090
- Then it was you all the time.
- Yes.

629
01:00:58,176 --> 01:01:01,088
- You played that music in the night.
- Yes.

630
01:01:01,176 --> 01:01:03,849
- To get us into the laboratory.
- Yes.

631
01:01:03,936 --> 01:01:07,406
- That was your cigar in the ashtray.
- Yes.

632
01:01:07,496 --> 01:01:10,772
And it was you who left
my grandfather's book out for me to find.

633
01:01:10,856 --> 01:01:12,084
Yes.

634
01:01:12,176 --> 01:01:13,848
- So that I would...
- Yes.

635
01:01:13,936 --> 01:01:16,496
- Then you and Victor were...
- Yes.

636
01:01:16,576 --> 01:01:18,771
Yes! Say it!

637
01:01:18,856 --> 01:01:22,565
He was my boyfriend.

638
01:01:33,936 --> 01:01:35,927
You will never catch him now.

639
01:01:36,016 --> 01:01:39,247
He's free. Do you hear?

640
01:01:39,336 --> 01:01:41,611
Free.

641
01:01:54,656 --> 01:01:56,055
Gone.

642
01:01:56,576 --> 01:01:57,929
Gone!

643
01:01:58,016 --> 01:02:00,450
We've got to find him, do you understand?

644
01:02:00,536 --> 01:02:03,369
We've got to find him
before he kills someone.

645
01:02:04,056 --> 01:02:06,047
What have I done?

646
01:02:06,456 --> 01:02:08,651
Oh, God in heaven.

647
01:02:09,656 --> 01:02:11,647
What have I done?

648
01:02:17,816 --> 01:02:21,092
Oh, I love my pretty little flower

649
01:02:21,496 --> 01:02:24,886
Oh, I love my pretty little flower

650
01:02:24,976 --> 01:02:27,809
Oh, I love my flower

651
01:02:33,856 --> 01:02:35,847
That monster is loose...

652
01:02:36,856 --> 01:02:39,575
Boards must be tight.

653
01:02:41,496 --> 01:02:43,487
There.

654
01:02:45,056 --> 01:02:47,047
Thank God you put Helga to bed.

655
01:02:47,136 --> 01:02:51,254
With all this monster business,
I take no chances. I remember the last time.

656
01:02:51,336 --> 01:02:56,251
But, Papa. I told you that I was turning
the Rostbraten, don't you remember?

657
01:02:56,336 --> 01:02:58,327
I asked you to put Helga to...

658
01:02:58,936 --> 01:03:00,255
You...

659
01:03:04,336 --> 01:03:07,055
Now throw a kiss and say bye-bye.

660
01:03:14,896 --> 01:03:17,205
Oh, dear. Nothing left.

661
01:03:17,296 --> 01:03:19,810
What shall we throw in now?

662
01:03:24,136 --> 01:03:26,570
Maybe she was in the bathroom
when you looked.

663
01:03:26,656 --> 01:03:29,807
But I didn't even look upstairs.
I thought you did.

664
01:03:31,976 --> 01:03:33,967
You didn't look upstairs?

665
01:03:35,616 --> 01:03:37,607
Sit down.

666
01:03:38,696 --> 01:03:40,049
Sit down!

667
01:04:25,896 --> 01:04:28,535
A visitor is all I ask.

668
01:04:28,616 --> 01:04:33,087
A temporary companion to help me
pass a few short hours in my lonely life.

669
01:04:36,936 --> 01:04:40,087
Thank you, Lord. Thank you.

670
01:04:49,416 --> 01:04:52,408
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't speak. Don't say a word.

671
01:04:52,936 --> 01:04:56,008
Oh, myjoy and my prize from heaven.

672
01:04:56,816 --> 01:04:59,888
Oh, you must have been
the tallest one in your class.

673
01:04:59,976 --> 01:05:03,491
My name is Harold and I live here all alone.

674
01:05:03,576 --> 01:05:05,328
What is your name?

675
01:05:05,416 --> 01:05:07,532
I didn't get that.

676
01:05:08,456 --> 01:05:10,128
No...

677
01:05:10,736 --> 01:05:12,454
Forgive me.

678
01:05:12,536 --> 01:05:15,414
I didn't realise you were a mute.

679
01:05:15,496 --> 01:05:17,487
You see how heaven plans.

680
01:05:17,576 --> 01:05:20,852
Me, a poor blind man, and you a mute.

681
01:05:22,856 --> 01:05:25,211
An incredibly big mute.

682
01:05:25,296 --> 01:05:27,526
But your hand is frozen, my child.

683
01:05:27,616 --> 01:05:30,176
How does a nice bowl of soup sound, huh?

684
01:05:40,096 --> 01:05:43,805
Well, I know what it means
to be cold and hungry.

685
01:05:43,896 --> 01:05:44,931
Yes...

686
01:05:45,016 --> 01:05:48,565
And how much it means to have
a little kindness from a stranger.

687
01:05:48,656 --> 01:05:51,295
Are you ready for your soup?

688
01:05:52,936 --> 01:05:55,689
Hold out your bowl, then.

689
01:05:57,256 --> 01:05:59,167
Oh, my friend...

690
01:05:59,256 --> 01:06:01,724
You don't know what your visit means to me.

691
01:06:01,816 --> 01:06:05,331
How long I've waited for the pleasure
of another human being.

692
01:06:05,416 --> 01:06:09,045
Sometimes in our preoccupation
with worldly matters,

693
01:06:10,776 --> 01:06:14,530
we tend to forget the simple pleasures

694
01:06:14,616 --> 01:06:17,733
that are the basis for true happiness.

695
01:06:19,176 --> 01:06:22,054
And now a little wine with your soup?

696
01:06:23,816 --> 01:06:25,807
Good, good.

697
01:06:34,496 --> 01:06:37,090
Huh? Good. Yes.

698
01:06:41,256 --> 01:06:43,531
Wait!

699
01:06:43,616 --> 01:06:45,925
A toast.

700
01:06:46,016 --> 01:06:49,565
A toast to long friendship.

701
01:06:55,696 --> 01:06:57,687
How hungry you must have been.

702
01:06:57,776 --> 01:07:00,165
Now for a little surprise.

703
01:07:00,256 --> 01:07:02,895
For a special occasion, I've been saving...

704
01:07:07,936 --> 01:07:09,892
..cigars.

705
01:07:11,416 --> 01:07:13,168
Take one.

706
01:07:16,656 --> 01:07:17,452
What?

707
01:07:17,536 --> 01:07:19,527
No, no, no.

708
01:07:20,136 --> 01:07:22,047
Fire is good.

709
01:07:22,136 --> 01:07:25,526
Fire is good. Yes, fire is our friend.

710
01:07:25,616 --> 01:07:27,846
Yes. I'll show you.

711
01:07:36,096 --> 01:07:38,087
You see?

712
01:07:38,696 --> 01:07:40,414
You have your cigar?

713
01:07:40,496 --> 01:07:42,487
Let me see. Let me see.

714
01:07:42,576 --> 01:07:44,134
All right.

715
01:07:44,216 --> 01:07:46,207
Now, now, now...

716
01:07:46,816 --> 01:07:49,091
Just hold it right there. Now,

717
01:07:49,776 --> 01:07:52,848
don't inhale until the tip glows.

718
01:08:10,456 --> 01:08:12,447
Wait.

719
01:08:14,376 --> 01:08:15,855
Wait.

720
01:08:15,936 --> 01:08:17,927
Where are you going?

721
01:08:18,456 --> 01:08:21,812
I was gonna make espresso.

722
01:09:03,536 --> 01:09:04,605
Now!

723
01:09:09,096 --> 01:09:11,087
Quick. Give him the sedative.

724
01:09:27,776 --> 01:09:29,767
He's out.

725
01:09:30,816 --> 01:09:32,408
I know.

726
01:09:40,856 --> 01:09:45,088
I'm going in there. Bring me that candle.

727
01:09:45,176 --> 01:09:47,167
- No.
- Yes.

728
01:09:51,616 --> 01:09:53,527
Love

729
01:09:53,616 --> 01:09:56,892
is the only thing
that can save this poor creature.

730
01:09:57,576 --> 01:10:00,568
And I am going to convince him
that he is loved

731
01:10:01,696 --> 01:10:04,608
even at the cost of my own life.

732
01:10:06,536 --> 01:10:10,734
No matter what you hear in there,
no matter how cruelly I beg you,

733
01:10:11,336 --> 01:10:14,169
no matter how terribly I may scream,

734
01:10:15,056 --> 01:10:19,288
do not open this door,
or you will undo everything I've worked for.

735
01:10:19,376 --> 01:10:20,889
Do you understand?

736
01:10:20,976 --> 01:10:24,013
Do not open this door.

737
01:10:24,096 --> 01:10:25,495
Yes, Doctor.

738
01:10:27,696 --> 01:10:29,687
Nice working with you.

739
01:11:00,536 --> 01:11:03,608
Let me out. Let me out of here.
Get me the hell out of here.

740
01:11:04,296 --> 01:11:06,969
What's the matter with you people?
I was joking.

741
01:11:07,056 --> 01:11:09,206
Don't you know ajoke when you hear one?

742
01:11:12,696 --> 01:11:15,927
Jesus Christ. Get me outta here!

743
01:11:18,256 --> 01:11:21,805
Open this goddamn door
or I'll kick your rotten heads in.

744
01:11:21,896 --> 01:11:23,409
Mommy!

745
01:11:31,376 --> 01:11:33,173
Obviously...

746
01:11:37,096 --> 01:11:39,405
Hello, handsome.

747
01:11:42,256 --> 01:11:44,565
You're a good-looking fellow, you know?

748
01:11:44,656 --> 01:11:47,090
People laugh at you.

749
01:11:47,176 --> 01:11:49,849
People hate you, but why do they hate you?

750
01:11:49,936 --> 01:11:53,645
Because they are jealous.

751
01:11:54,816 --> 01:11:57,410
Look at that boyish face.

752
01:11:59,256 --> 01:12:01,247
Look at that sweet smile.

753
01:12:02,896 --> 01:12:05,854
Do you wanna talk about physical strength?

754
01:12:05,936 --> 01:12:09,133
Do you want to talk about sheer muscle?

755
01:12:10,536 --> 01:12:13,608
Do you want to talk
about the Olympian ideal?

756
01:12:13,696 --> 01:12:16,256
You are a god!

757
01:12:17,176 --> 01:12:19,167
And listen to me...

758
01:12:20,016 --> 01:12:22,484
You are not evil.

759
01:12:23,856 --> 01:12:27,974
You are good!

760
01:12:35,776 --> 01:12:38,688
This is a nice boy.

761
01:12:39,376 --> 01:12:41,367
This is a good boy.

762
01:12:42,256 --> 01:12:44,565
This is a mother's angel.

763
01:12:45,336 --> 01:12:47,930
And I want the world to know,

764
01:12:48,736 --> 01:12:52,206
once and for all and without any shame,

765
01:12:53,816 --> 01:12:56,489
that we love him.

766
01:13:00,256 --> 01:13:02,770
I'm going to teach you.

767
01:13:02,856 --> 01:13:07,566
I'm gonna show you how to walk,
how to speak, how to move, how to think.

768
01:13:08,576 --> 01:13:10,134
Together,

769
01:13:10,216 --> 01:13:12,172
you and I

770
01:13:12,256 --> 01:13:18,047
are going to make
the greatest single contribution to science

771
01:13:18,856 --> 01:13:21,495
since the creation offire!

772
01:13:22,056 --> 01:13:25,412
Dr Fronkonsteen. Are you all right?

773
01:13:25,496 --> 01:13:27,487
My name...

774
01:13:28,256 --> 01:13:31,373
..is Frankenstein!

775
01:14:22,816 --> 01:14:26,172
Distinguished colleagues,
ladies and gentlemen.

776
01:14:26,256 --> 01:14:28,326
Tonight it is my great privilege

777
01:14:28,416 --> 01:14:32,568
of introducing to you a man
whose family name was once both

778
01:14:32,656 --> 01:14:34,612
famous

779
01:14:34,696 --> 01:14:36,891
and infamous.

780
01:14:37,416 --> 01:14:43,651
And now may I present to you
DoktorBaron Friedrich von Frankenstein.

781
01:14:51,936 --> 01:14:54,086
My fellow scienti...

782
01:14:55,256 --> 01:15:00,011
..tists... and neurosurgeons,
ladies and gentlemen.

783
01:15:00,816 --> 01:15:03,489
A few short weeks ago,
coming from a background,

784
01:15:03,576 --> 01:15:08,570
believe me, as conservative and traditionally
grounded in scientific fact as any ofyou,

785
01:15:08,656 --> 01:15:13,446
I began an experiment in,
incredulous as it may sound,

786
01:15:14,536 --> 01:15:17,004
the reanimation of dead tissue.

787
01:15:20,056 --> 01:15:24,368
What I have to offer you might possibly be

788
01:15:24,456 --> 01:15:27,209
the gateway to immortality.

789
01:15:32,216 --> 01:15:37,893
Ladies and gentlemen, may I present for
your intellectual and philosophical pleasure

790
01:15:39,656 --> 01:15:41,647
the Creature.

791
01:15:47,776 --> 01:15:49,846
Remain in your seats, I beg you.

792
01:15:49,936 --> 01:15:53,167
We are not children here. We are scientists.

793
01:15:54,056 --> 01:15:56,365
I assure you there is nothing to fear.

794
01:15:59,816 --> 01:16:03,445
First may I offer for your consideration

795
01:16:03,536 --> 01:16:08,007
a neurological demonstration
ofthe primary cerebellar functions.

796
01:16:08,896 --> 01:16:11,888
Balance and coordination.

797
01:16:14,136 --> 01:16:17,014
Walk heel to toe.

798
01:16:30,056 --> 01:16:32,047
Backwards.

799
01:16:47,616 --> 01:16:51,973
Ladies and gentlemen, you've seen
the Creature perform simple motor activity,

800
01:16:52,056 --> 01:16:56,766
but for what you will see next
we must enter quietly

801
01:16:56,856 --> 01:16:59,893
into the realm of genius.

802
01:17:02,576 --> 01:17:04,567
Ladies and gentlemen,

803
01:17:08,216 --> 01:17:12,573
from what was once
an inarticulate mass of lifeless tissues,

804
01:17:12,656 --> 01:17:16,535
may I now present
a cultured, sophisticated

805
01:17:17,896 --> 01:17:19,648
man about town.

806
01:17:23,576 --> 01:17:24,804
Hit it.

807
01:19:05,176 --> 01:19:07,167
Nothing. Nothing, I tell you.

808
01:19:07,976 --> 01:19:09,614
Five, six, seven, eight...

809
01:19:12,816 --> 01:19:15,853
Come on. Are you trying
to make me look like a fool?

810
01:19:20,696 --> 01:19:22,049
Please. I beg you.

811
01:19:22,136 --> 01:19:24,775
For safety's sake, don't humiliate him.

812
01:19:27,896 --> 01:19:31,775
Come back. Do you hear me?
I will not let you destroy my work.

813
01:19:31,856 --> 01:19:34,450
As your creator
I command you to come back.

814
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:27,574
Chained.

815
01:20:27,656 --> 01:20:30,216
Chained like a beast in a cage.

816
01:20:31,136 --> 01:20:33,525
Oh, Doctor. I feel so terrible.

817
01:20:33,616 --> 01:20:35,607
There's only one answer.

818
01:20:35,696 --> 01:20:40,247
If I could find a way to equalise
the imbalance in his cerebral-spinal fluid,

819
01:20:40,336 --> 01:20:43,089
why, he'd be as right as rain.

820
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:45,368
But how?

821
01:20:45,456 --> 01:20:47,651
How, before it's too late?

822
01:20:48,816 --> 01:20:50,488
Oh, Frederick...

823
01:20:50,576 --> 01:20:52,646
If only there was some way I could...

824
01:20:53,696 --> 01:20:56,290
..relieve this torture you are going through.

825
01:20:58,376 --> 01:21:00,367
Ifthere was some way I could help to...

826
01:21:02,096 --> 01:21:07,454
..relieve the tension. Ifthere was just
some way I could give you a little peace.

827
01:21:15,056 --> 01:21:17,047
Doctor, I have...

828
01:21:17,136 --> 01:21:18,933
Doctor?

829
01:21:19,936 --> 01:21:21,927
What is it?

830
01:21:24,296 --> 01:21:26,093
Doctor...

831
01:21:26,176 --> 01:21:28,326
Where are you?

832
01:21:40,976 --> 01:21:44,412
I'm sorry, Doctor.
This cable came while you were gone.

833
01:21:44,496 --> 01:21:49,172
I thought I told you never to
interrupt me while I'm working.

834
01:21:50,456 --> 01:21:54,005
I'm sorry, Doctor.
I thought this was an emergency.

835
01:21:54,096 --> 01:21:57,884
You see, your fiancee
will be arriving any second.

836
01:21:57,976 --> 01:22:00,490
What? Elizabeth here tonight?

837
01:22:00,576 --> 01:22:03,773
Yes. I will go prepare a room at once.

838
01:22:05,336 --> 01:22:07,611
I suggest you put on a tie.

839
01:22:26,816 --> 01:22:28,886
Darling.

840
01:22:28,976 --> 01:22:31,012
Darling.

841
01:22:31,096 --> 01:22:32,575
- Surprised?
- Surprised.

842
01:22:32,656 --> 01:22:34,647
- Love me?
- Love you?

843
01:22:35,576 --> 01:22:37,567
Well...

844
01:22:38,296 --> 01:22:40,856
- Let's turn in.
- Darling.

845
01:22:40,936 --> 01:22:45,373
It's been a long day. I'm sure you're very tired.
I'll just pay the driver.

846
01:22:46,216 --> 01:22:48,810
- Darling.
- What?

847
01:22:49,336 --> 01:22:51,770
- Surprised?
- Yes.

848
01:22:51,856 --> 01:22:53,847
- Love me?
- Well...

849
01:22:53,936 --> 01:22:56,131
Well, let's turn in.

850
01:22:56,216 --> 01:22:57,729
- Darling.
- Yes.

851
01:22:57,816 --> 01:22:59,454
Say nothing, act casual.

852
01:22:59,536 --> 01:23:02,130
- Ready?
- Yes. I think...

853
01:23:02,776 --> 01:23:04,448
Yes.

854
01:23:04,536 --> 01:23:06,527
I am a bit tired after all.

855
01:23:08,616 --> 01:23:11,688
I'd like you to meet
my assistants, lnga and l-gor.

856
01:23:11,776 --> 01:23:13,767
How do you do?

857
01:23:14,616 --> 01:23:15,605
How do you do?

858
01:23:15,696 --> 01:23:19,814
- This is my financier Elizabeth.
- I'm so happy to meet you at last.

859
01:23:19,896 --> 01:23:20,885
Financee.

860
01:23:20,976 --> 01:23:26,096
Excuse me, darling.
What is it exactly that you... do do?

861
01:23:28,736 --> 01:23:32,615
Well, I assist Dr Fronkonsteen
in the laboratory.

862
01:23:33,056 --> 01:23:35,365
We have intellectual discussions undwe...

863
01:23:35,456 --> 01:23:37,731
As a matter offact, we were just having one...

864
01:23:37,816 --> 01:23:39,169
- May l...?
- What?

865
01:23:39,256 --> 01:23:40,848
Wait a minute...

866
01:23:40,936 --> 01:23:43,575
I-gor, would you give me
a hand with the bags?

867
01:23:43,656 --> 01:23:47,968
Certainly, you take the blonde
and I'll take the one in the turban.

868
01:23:52,576 --> 01:23:55,170
Stop that. I'm talking about the luggage.

869
01:23:55,256 --> 01:23:56,848
Yes, master.

870
01:23:57,456 --> 01:23:59,447
Ladies, this way.

871
01:24:01,096 --> 01:24:04,691
It'll be a long night.
Ifyou need any help with the girls...

872
01:24:11,816 --> 01:24:14,011
You settle down now.

873
01:24:14,096 --> 01:24:17,168
Cos we gonna be pals.

874
01:24:18,416 --> 01:24:19,610
Right?

875
01:24:22,056 --> 01:24:24,047
Nice and cosy.

876
01:24:24,136 --> 01:24:27,094
Just like old friends.

877
01:24:35,816 --> 01:24:39,695
What's the matter?
You're afraid ofthis little fire?

878
01:24:39,776 --> 01:24:41,573
This can't hurt you.

879
01:24:41,656 --> 01:24:43,647
See?

880
01:24:44,856 --> 01:24:46,653
Some monster you are.

881
01:24:46,736 --> 01:24:48,806
See, Mama was right.

882
01:24:48,896 --> 01:24:52,252
Little boys ain't supposed to play with fire.

883
01:24:53,416 --> 01:24:55,976
Is they? Cos they might get hurt.

884
01:25:22,976 --> 01:25:24,489
Halt!

885
01:25:24,576 --> 01:25:26,214
Up.

886
01:25:26,296 --> 01:25:28,856
A riot is an ugly thing.

887
01:25:29,856 --> 01:25:33,895
Und I think that it is just about time
that we had one.

888
01:25:36,216 --> 01:25:37,695
Kill the monster.

889
01:25:38,056 --> 01:25:41,093
As heaven is my witness... Up.

890
01:25:41,176 --> 01:25:44,691
..he will curse the day

891
01:25:44,776 --> 01:25:48,451
that he was burn a Frankenstein.

892
01:25:49,376 --> 01:25:50,365
What?

893
01:25:51,296 --> 01:25:55,847
I said: "He will curse the day
that he was born a Frankenstein."

894
01:26:11,576 --> 01:26:15,091
Loose. He's broken loose.

895
01:26:15,176 --> 01:26:17,406
Do you know what that means?

896
01:26:17,496 --> 01:26:20,090
Darling, you mustn't worry so.

897
01:26:22,416 --> 01:26:24,327
I suppose you're right.

898
01:26:24,416 --> 01:26:26,247
Of course I am.

899
01:26:26,336 --> 01:26:28,327
Now come along like a good boy.

900
01:26:28,816 --> 01:26:30,693
What would I do without you?

901
01:26:30,776 --> 01:26:35,247
Is your room just down the hall
in case I get the frights during the night?

902
01:26:35,776 --> 01:26:40,486
Well, yes, but I thought perhaps tonight,
under the circumstances, I might

903
01:26:41,136 --> 01:26:43,092
stay here with you.

904
01:26:43,176 --> 01:26:45,690
Would you want me like this now?

905
01:26:45,776 --> 01:26:49,371
So soon before our wedding,
so near we can almost touch it?

906
01:26:52,016 --> 01:26:54,211
- Yes!
- Whoa, boy.

907
01:26:55,136 --> 01:26:57,127
Or

908
01:26:57,216 --> 01:27:02,768
to waitjust a little while longer when
I can give myselfto you without hesitation,

909
01:27:02,856 --> 01:27:06,610
when I can be totally
and unashamedly and legally yours?

910
01:27:10,576 --> 01:27:13,090
That's a tough choice.

911
01:27:13,176 --> 01:27:15,371
You're a tough guy.

912
01:27:17,936 --> 01:27:19,733
I suppose you're right.

913
01:27:19,816 --> 01:27:21,807
Of course I am. I always am.

914
01:27:22,896 --> 01:27:25,364
Now give me a kiss and say good night.

915
01:27:28,496 --> 01:27:30,487
No tongues.

916
01:27:37,256 --> 01:27:39,690
Good night, darling.

917
01:27:39,816 --> 01:27:42,091
Good night, sweetheart.

918
01:27:42,176 --> 01:27:44,326
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

919
01:27:44,416 --> 01:27:48,204
You love me? I love you, honey.

920
01:27:48,296 --> 01:27:50,605
- Sweet dreams, darling.
- Sweet dreams.

921
01:27:50,696 --> 01:27:53,893
Good night, don't let the bedbugs bite.

922
01:27:59,776 --> 01:28:05,646
He has loosed the fateful lightning
of his terrible swift sword

923
01:28:06,056 --> 01:28:09,128
His truth is marching on

924
01:28:11,176 --> 01:28:15,294
Glory, glory, hallelujah...

925
01:29:08,136 --> 01:29:10,127
Where am l?

926
01:29:12,336 --> 01:29:14,850
Who are you? What are you?

927
01:29:14,936 --> 01:29:17,609
What do you want?
What are you going to do to me?

928
01:29:18,536 --> 01:29:20,413
Calm down.

929
01:29:20,496 --> 01:29:22,293
I'm not afraid ofyou.

930
01:29:22,376 --> 01:29:26,289
My father is very rich.
You'd have the world at your fingertips.

931
01:29:26,376 --> 01:29:32,485
Listen. I have to be back by 11.30.
I'm expecting a very important call.

932
01:29:33,376 --> 01:29:35,571
Speak! Why don't you speak?

933
01:29:35,656 --> 01:29:37,647
What are you doing?

934
01:29:37,736 --> 01:29:39,931
Oh, no, you can't be serious.

935
01:29:42,136 --> 01:29:44,127
I'm af...

936
01:29:44,856 --> 01:29:46,767
Oh, my God.

937
01:29:46,856 --> 01:29:47,845
Woof.

938
01:29:51,136 --> 01:29:52,728
I'm engaged.

939
01:29:52,816 --> 01:29:55,410
And once he... But I didn't... It was never...

940
01:30:01,776 --> 01:30:03,971
Sweet mystery of life

941
01:30:04,056 --> 01:30:06,934
At last I found you

942
01:30:07,496 --> 01:30:12,889
At last I know the secret of it all

943
01:30:43,376 --> 01:30:45,844
Penny for your thoughts.

944
01:30:47,856 --> 01:30:50,654
You're incorrigible, aren't you?

945
01:30:51,016 --> 01:30:53,484
You little zipper-neck.

946
01:30:56,616 --> 01:30:58,015
All right.

947
01:30:58,096 --> 01:31:00,690
Seven has always been my lucky number.

948
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:04,655
Come over here, you hot monster.

949
01:31:07,976 --> 01:31:10,729
What is it? What's the matter?

950
01:31:11,776 --> 01:31:13,892
Is it that music?

951
01:31:13,976 --> 01:31:17,651
It's probably from some nearby cottage.
Nothing to worry about.

952
01:31:17,736 --> 01:31:19,727
Where are you going? Where...

953
01:31:20,056 --> 01:31:21,967
You men are all alike.

954
01:31:22,056 --> 01:31:24,934
Seven or eight quick ones
and you're offwith the boys.

955
01:31:25,016 --> 01:31:28,531
To boast and brag.
You better keep your mouth shut.

956
01:31:29,016 --> 01:31:31,689
Oh, I think I love him.

957
01:32:16,536 --> 01:32:19,892
Look, he's coming back.
Look, the music...

958
01:32:20,496 --> 01:32:22,452
Keep playing. It's the music.

959
01:32:22,536 --> 01:32:25,414
It's the music that's bringing him back.

960
01:32:28,096 --> 01:32:29,768
Come on.

961
01:32:37,416 --> 01:32:39,134
Come on. Come.

962
01:32:44,056 --> 01:32:46,206
Come on. You can do it.

963
01:32:51,776 --> 01:32:54,336
Come on. You can do it.

964
01:33:00,336 --> 01:33:04,124
Don't touch him!
He wants to do it by himself.

965
01:33:04,736 --> 01:33:07,614
You can do it. You can do it.

966
01:33:08,376 --> 01:33:10,810
Please, my creation.

967
01:33:20,696 --> 01:33:22,687
Quick. Catch him.

968
01:33:27,456 --> 01:33:30,846
Have all the preparations
been made for the transference?

969
01:33:30,936 --> 01:33:32,369
Yes, Doctor.

970
01:33:32,456 --> 01:33:34,890
Are you sure you want
to go through with this?

971
01:33:34,976 --> 01:33:37,365
It's the only thing that can save him now.

972
01:33:37,936 --> 01:33:40,928
You realise you're risking both your lives?

973
01:33:43,256 --> 01:33:45,247
Yes.

974
01:33:57,416 --> 01:33:59,407
Switching off.

975
01:34:18,496 --> 01:34:20,691
How will I know when they are done?

976
01:34:20,776 --> 01:34:23,006
The doctor said to allow 15 minutes.

977
01:34:23,656 --> 01:34:25,772
Not one second more

978
01:34:25,856 --> 01:34:27,608
or less.

979
01:34:35,856 --> 01:34:37,494
How long now?

980
01:34:37,576 --> 01:34:39,168
Two minutes.

981
01:35:00,656 --> 01:35:02,647
- What's that noise?
- I don't know.

982
01:35:02,736 --> 01:35:04,966
- What time is it?
- Almost time.

983
01:35:09,376 --> 01:35:12,174
Oh, my God. It's the villagers.

984
01:35:14,296 --> 01:35:16,491
No! No! Please.

985
01:35:16,576 --> 01:35:18,771
Just another seven seconds.

986
01:35:21,896 --> 01:35:23,887
No! No!

987
01:35:25,416 --> 01:35:27,407
No! No! No!

988
01:35:28,056 --> 01:35:30,729
- Put that man down.
- It's the monster.

989
01:35:30,816 --> 01:35:32,534
- No, it can't be.
- It is.

990
01:35:32,616 --> 01:35:35,210
I said: "Put that man down."

991
01:35:44,136 --> 01:35:46,696
Undjust who do you think you are

992
01:35:46,776 --> 01:35:49,609
that you order these people about?

993
01:35:49,696 --> 01:35:51,687
I am the monster.

994
01:35:53,656 --> 01:35:56,329
Ja. I see that you are the monster.

995
01:35:56,416 --> 01:35:58,976
For as long as I can remember

996
01:35:59,056 --> 01:36:01,490
people have hated me.

997
01:36:01,736 --> 01:36:04,808
They looked at my face and my body

998
01:36:04,896 --> 01:36:06,887
and they ran away in horror.

999
01:36:06,976 --> 01:36:13,449
In my loneliness, I decided that if I could not
inspire love, which was my deepest hope,

1000
01:36:13,536 --> 01:36:15,652
I would instead cause fear.

1001
01:36:17,696 --> 01:36:19,687
I live,

1002
01:36:20,896 --> 01:36:25,970
because this poor, half-crazed
genius has given me life.

1003
01:36:26,496 --> 01:36:28,487
He alone held an image of me

1004
01:36:28,576 --> 01:36:30,885
as something beautiful.

1005
01:36:31,256 --> 01:36:33,087
And then,

1006
01:36:33,176 --> 01:36:36,885
when it would have been easy enough
to stay out of danger,

1007
01:36:37,336 --> 01:36:40,294
he used his own body as a guinea pig

1008
01:36:40,376 --> 01:36:42,936
to give me a calmer brain

1009
01:36:43,976 --> 01:36:50,006
and a somewhat more
sophisticated way of expressing myself.

1010
01:36:50,096 --> 01:36:54,726
Well, this is, of course,
an entirely different situation.

1011
01:36:55,376 --> 01:36:57,970
As the leader ofthis community,

1012
01:36:58,056 --> 01:37:01,651
may I be the first to offer you my hand

1013
01:37:02,336 --> 01:37:04,327
in friendship.

1014
01:37:10,096 --> 01:37:12,405
- Thank you.
- You are entirely welcome.

1015
01:37:12,496 --> 01:37:17,251
Und now let us all go to my house
for a little sponge cake unda little wine...

1016
01:37:18,496 --> 01:37:20,487
..undshit!

1017
01:37:22,896 --> 01:37:24,887
To the lumberyard!

1018
01:37:47,696 --> 01:37:50,210
Hello, Mrs Frankenstein.

1019
01:37:50,896 --> 01:37:54,047
Mrs Frankenstein. What a beautiful name.

1020
01:37:54,136 --> 01:37:55,774
Oh, darling.

1021
01:37:55,856 --> 01:37:57,847
Hold on to your hat.

1022
01:37:59,216 --> 01:38:00,126
What?

1023
01:38:00,216 --> 01:38:03,128
I'll be right back.

1024
01:38:16,776 --> 01:38:19,290
I'm holding on to it, darling.

1025
01:38:20,256 --> 01:38:22,645
Just a few more seconds.

1026
01:39:01,136 --> 01:39:05,129
Honey, I hope you didn't find
Daddy's little party too boring.

1027
01:39:05,216 --> 01:39:08,526
He did itjust for you
and he meant so well. Say you liked it.

1028
01:39:09,776 --> 01:39:11,767
Honey, did you see?

1029
01:39:11,856 --> 01:39:15,212
I put a special hamper in the bathroom
just for your shirts

1030
01:39:15,296 --> 01:39:18,288
and the other one is just for socks
and poo-poo undies.

1031
01:39:18,376 --> 01:39:20,014
Here I come.

1032
01:39:47,936 --> 01:39:50,370
The feeling is mutual.

1033
01:39:52,536 --> 01:39:54,527
You know, it's a puzzlement.

1034
01:39:54,616 --> 01:39:58,928
There's something I've always wanted
to ask you about that operation.

1035
01:39:59,016 --> 01:40:01,132
You know in the transference part,

1036
01:40:01,216 --> 01:40:06,495
the monster got part ofyour wonderful brain,
but what did you ever get from him?

1037
01:40:15,816 --> 01:40:18,694
No. I don't believe...

1038
01:40:22,736 --> 01:40:24,886
Sweet mystery of life

1039
01:40:24,976 --> 01:40:27,649
At last I found you

1040
01:41:13,376 --> 01:41:15,367
