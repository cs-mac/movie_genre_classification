1
00:00:28,896 --> 00:00:31,432
<i>Laughter is a sin around here.</i>

2
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:35,003
<i>You know why? Because laughter
can mean happiness</i>

3
00:00:35,103 --> 00:00:37,839
<i>and I want you boys to always know</i>

4
00:00:37,939 --> 00:00:42,968
<i>happiness don't exist for you.</i>

5
00:00:44,012 --> 00:00:47,106
<i>It exists for the privileged,
for the loved.</i>

6
00:00:48,417 --> 00:00:52,479
<i>The world outside don't care about you!</i>

7
00:00:53,388 --> 00:00:55,557
<i>So laughing is just pretending.</i>

8
00:00:55,657 --> 00:00:57,792
<i>And if they make believe over here, uh-uh.</i>

9
00:00:57,892 --> 00:01:02,516
<i>This here is a home for the wayward,
for the orphaned, for the discarded.</i>

10
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:07,727
<i>I am setting you up to succeed.</i>

11
00:01:09,204 --> 00:01:11,540
<i>Because y'all too stupid
to know the truth.</i>

12
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,843
<i>And you'll thank me for this
when you get old enough, okay?</i>

13
00:01:14,943 --> 00:01:19,314
<i>Believe me, you'll thank me
for telling you the truth.</i>

14
00:01:24,653 --> 00:01:28,959
My hates have a tendency
to move around, you know?

15
00:01:29,059 --> 00:01:33,196
I hate that I'm losing this game of cards.
I hate you asking me questions.

16
00:01:33,296 --> 00:01:35,531
Frank Stone?

17
00:01:35,631 --> 00:01:38,101
I neither hate him nor like him.

18
00:01:38,201 --> 00:01:40,937
I'm a professional headmaster.

19
00:01:41,037 --> 00:01:42,438
I'm objective.

20
00:01:42,538 --> 00:01:45,841
I'm not a homosexual. I'm a pedophile.

21
00:01:45,941 --> 00:01:49,579
It's different, okay?

22
00:01:49,679 --> 00:01:52,306
I teach them boys who they are.

23
00:01:52,982 --> 00:01:55,576
So society wants to kill it.

24
00:01:57,287 --> 00:02:01,524
These boys up here, who do they got?
Ain't nobody, just each other, just boys.

25
00:02:01,624 --> 00:02:05,428
They gotta learn how to love each other.
So I teach 'em how.

26
00:02:06,663 --> 00:02:10,091
I don't mess with old men. I'm married.

27
00:02:11,335 --> 00:02:13,637
It's degenerate.

28
00:02:13,737 --> 00:02:16,161
Outside the bounds.
He's on the other side of the street.

29
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:20,311
I'm walking down the street, right?
Right street. He's across the street.

30
00:02:20,411 --> 00:02:22,503
Always has been.

31
00:02:29,686 --> 00:02:32,373
Working for the mob.
Who does he think he is, Al Capone?

32
00:04:13,393 --> 00:04:15,820
No, no!

33
00:04:17,397 --> 00:04:19,866
No, no!

34
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:22,302
Knock it off.

35
00:04:22,702 --> 00:04:25,070
I said knock it off.

36
00:04:29,909 --> 00:04:32,203
I got it open.

37
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,075
Get the merchandise.

38
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:55,470
Slow down.

39
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:58,497
You can get the cops on a day off.

40
00:05:12,487 --> 00:05:14,670
Listen to me, you stupid jerk-off.

41
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:17,876
You're not my boss,
so don't talk to me like that.

42
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:21,864
If I want to get some action off some
broad, I will, okay? That's my business.

43
00:05:21,964 --> 00:05:26,268
I thought you acted inappropriately.
Were you tryin' to get us popped for rape?

44
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:29,226
- Next time, I'll just fuckin' kill...
- Whoa!

45
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,529
You should have kept
a better class of friend.

46
00:06:20,957 --> 00:06:22,959
<i>I see the frustration of sin!</i>

47
00:06:23,059 --> 00:06:27,497
<i>I feel the frustration of sin.</i>

48
00:06:27,897 --> 00:06:30,568
<i>Let me tell you,
if you don't already know.</i>

49
00:06:30,668 --> 00:06:33,971
<i>Sin is the apple that's put
in front of the horse.</i>

50
00:06:34,071 --> 00:06:38,241
<i>It was the apple presented to Eve
in the garden of Eden.</i>

51
00:06:38,341 --> 00:06:43,414
<i>And it's the apple of my eye when I see
that nice little rump on all of you.</i>

52
00:06:43,514 --> 00:06:45,949
<i>It's mine to take!</i>

53
00:06:46,049 --> 00:06:50,120
<i>I'm headmaster. That's, like, God.</i>

54
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:54,158
<i>That's, like, the final say, okay?</i>

55
00:06:54,992 --> 00:06:59,663
<i>I take, I give, my surrender.</i>

56
00:06:59,963 --> 00:07:02,333
<i>But make no mistake!</i>

57
00:07:02,633 --> 00:07:05,803
<i>It's still me and not you.</i>

58
00:07:05,903 --> 00:07:08,840
<i>None of you have a claim or say.</i>

59
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,376
<i>I am the last word.</i>

60
00:07:11,476 --> 00:07:13,369
<i>Okay?</i>

61
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,150
- <i>Hey, Frank?</i>
- Yeah.

62
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:53,810
<i>The boss wants
to see you tomorrow. Understand?</i>

63
00:08:23,049 --> 00:08:25,551
- Let's not talk about it.
- Hooked on that shit?

64
00:08:25,651 --> 00:08:29,222
- It's in their veins.
- That's like that energy drink, right?

65
00:08:29,322 --> 00:08:31,992
It's their methedrine, their methedrine.

66
00:08:32,092 --> 00:08:35,529
- The first energy drink ever.
- Their first guy's talking shit all the time.

67
00:08:35,629 --> 00:08:38,465
- Hey, bud, are you in?
- Hey, Frank, how're you doing?

68
00:08:38,565 --> 00:08:40,967
Sit down, sit down.

69
00:08:41,067 --> 00:08:43,161
What do you have for me?

70
00:08:46,907 --> 00:08:49,134
A pretty nice haul.

71
00:08:49,576 --> 00:08:51,436
Whoa!

72
00:08:58,551 --> 00:09:00,246
Nice.

73
00:09:00,788 --> 00:09:02,748
Real nice.

74
00:09:03,374 --> 00:09:04,992
Clean job as always?

75
00:09:05,092 --> 00:09:09,063
A couple of bumps on the road,
but I paved them over, as always.

76
00:09:09,163 --> 00:09:13,267
Yeah, I heard. You know, you're one
coldhearted son of a bitch, Frank.

77
00:09:13,367 --> 00:09:15,169
Took out his own guy.

78
00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:18,742
You know, you remind me of this...

79
00:09:18,842 --> 00:09:23,210
this bedtime story that my father,
God bless his soul,

80
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:24,779
that he used to read to me as a kid.

81
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:29,083
It was about an evil bastard,
just like Frank. I'm tellin' ya.

82
00:09:29,183 --> 00:09:31,986
Frank, did your father ever used
to read you bedtime stories?

83
00:09:35,222 --> 00:09:37,860
I never knew my ol' man, Tony.

84
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:41,496
Oh, I'm sorry, Frank, I didn't know.
I didn't know, Frank.

85
00:09:41,596 --> 00:09:43,790
Give him his money.

86
00:09:45,367 --> 00:09:47,427
The money!

87
00:09:48,036 --> 00:09:51,575
Okay, Frank, here's your money.

88
00:09:52,908 --> 00:09:54,376
Thanks, Tony.

89
00:09:54,476 --> 00:09:56,544
Hey, Frank, I got a question for you.

90
00:09:56,644 --> 00:09:59,347
Now that you got all those
fazool's in your pocket,

91
00:09:59,447 --> 00:10:02,750
which one of your broad's
you gonna take out?

92
00:10:04,486 --> 00:10:06,889
Maybe take a shower...

93
00:10:07,889 --> 00:10:10,547
Take her to Paris,
some place more high end, romantic

94
00:10:10,647 --> 00:10:13,354
like Coney Island for a hot date.

95
00:10:15,599 --> 00:10:18,267
Did you need anything else, Tony?

96
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:21,968
No, that's it. Thanks, Frank.
Good work, good work.

97
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,825
- Have a nice day, fellas.
- Yeah, take it easy, handsome.

98
00:10:29,513 --> 00:10:32,081
What you guys break his balls for?
He's a fern.

99
00:10:32,181 --> 00:10:35,218
Alright, come on, let's play cards.
Come on, come on, come on.

100
00:11:27,204 --> 00:11:29,941
Long, long time ago...

101
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:32,803
Long time ago!

102
00:11:33,912 --> 00:11:36,848
You know, man figured out...

103
00:11:37,348 --> 00:11:41,519
Animal skin, beneficial to 'em.

104
00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:43,421
Good thing.

105
00:11:43,521 --> 00:11:49,360
Now, like this here,
keep ya warm in the winter.

106
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:52,230
Dry in the summer. My happy thing.

107
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:54,424
Animal skin.

108
00:11:58,069 --> 00:12:00,372
Like this belt here, see?

109
00:12:00,772 --> 00:12:02,941
It's leather, animal skin.

110
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:06,483
But there's many different functions.
There's holding my pants, you know?

111
00:12:08,413 --> 00:12:10,941
Tie a woman down and shoot.

112
00:12:11,818 --> 00:12:15,611
Be a good thing, too, sometimes.
Depends on the girl.

113
00:12:15,711 --> 00:12:18,190
Those women are hard to...

114
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:22,419
hard to figure them out
sometimes, you know?

115
00:12:23,662 --> 00:12:25,623
It's romantic.

116
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,036
Hit 'em for the punishment and...

117
00:12:30,136 --> 00:12:34,146
You know, wrap it around your hand
like this or on your fist like this.

118
00:12:35,174 --> 00:12:38,778
Bam! No more problem.

119
00:12:38,878 --> 00:12:41,213
That man go down.

120
00:12:41,613 --> 00:12:43,840
It's going down!

121
00:12:51,274 --> 00:12:53,510
Turn around, now.

122
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:55,670
Turn around!

123
00:13:01,618 --> 00:13:03,878
Grab your ankles.

124
00:13:07,457 --> 00:13:09,693
But you don't listen.

125
00:13:09,793 --> 00:13:13,997
Now I'm gonna fix your radio,
I'll teach ya.

126
00:13:14,297 --> 00:13:17,401
I'm using this belt as... alright?

127
00:13:17,701 --> 00:13:20,429
And this is a romantic use for it.

128
00:13:41,826 --> 00:13:44,432
Some place this was.

129
00:13:45,013 --> 00:13:47,349
It's a good thing they closed it.

130
00:13:47,999 --> 00:13:50,293
It was horribly run.

131
00:13:53,137 --> 00:13:56,975
Those poor boys,
they use them like punching bags.

132
00:13:57,075 --> 00:14:00,135
That's what... that's what I heard.

133
00:14:02,648 --> 00:14:04,750
It's a good thing we didn't go there, huh?

134
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:44,458
Hey, you better hurry up.
Class starts in a few minutes.

135
00:14:45,058 --> 00:14:46,860
What?

136
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:51,222
Oh, I thought you were
in my creative writing class.

137
00:14:53,116 --> 00:14:54,810
Sorry.

138
00:15:06,596 --> 00:15:08,181
Dominic was loaded, as usual.

139
00:15:08,281 --> 00:15:11,751
He loved to drink, which was a good thing
because at this point, he had to drink.

140
00:15:11,851 --> 00:15:14,641
If he didn't start his day by rolling out
of bed and crawling to the freezer

141
00:15:14,741 --> 00:15:17,823
for a few shots of vodka, his hands
would shake and he'd start to feel sick.

142
00:15:17,923 --> 00:15:19,761
And he'd become as manic
as a mental patient.

143
00:15:19,861 --> 00:15:22,895
But what are you gonna do?
Everybody's got their cross...

144
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:32,840
Dominic was a drunk and would always
be a drunk, but he was okay with that.

145
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,577
He was the heartbreakingly tragic figure
he always wanted to be,

146
00:15:35,677 --> 00:15:39,543
but with an abdominal sense of human that
made him borderline heroic in his own mind.

147
00:15:39,643 --> 00:15:43,517
He was destined to crash and burn. But
it was gonna be epic, if not entertaining.

148
00:15:43,617 --> 00:15:45,552
He had already come
close to cashing in once.

149
00:15:45,652 --> 00:15:49,055
Couple of winters back, he was found passed
out in his boxer shorts in the boulevard

150
00:15:49,155 --> 00:15:51,225
during a failed attempt
to get to a liquor store.

151
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,627
He spent the next 5 weeks
in the hospital.

152
00:15:53,727 --> 00:15:57,465
Initially, the doctors didn't give him much
of a chance. Dominic's liver was shot.

153
00:15:57,565 --> 00:16:00,599
He was completely yellow with jaundice.
His skin was yellow.

154
00:16:00,699 --> 00:16:04,106
The whites of his eyes were yellow, if he
had been wearing a top hat and a monocle,

155
00:16:04,206 --> 00:16:07,009
he could've passed for Mr. Peanut,
but somehow he survived.

156
00:16:07,109 --> 00:16:10,212
Supposedly, the liver is a highly
regenerative organ, or so they told him.

157
00:16:10,312 --> 00:16:13,522
The doctors lectured Dominic about how
he was being given a second chance to live

158
00:16:13,622 --> 00:16:15,433
and how he needed to make
some serious lifestyle changes...

159
00:16:15,533 --> 00:16:18,454
Alright, thank you, thank you, Bradford.

160
00:16:19,121 --> 00:16:23,025
Anybody have any questions
for Bradford, class?

161
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:27,162
- Yes, Ackley?
- It didn't do anything for me.

162
00:16:27,262 --> 00:16:30,398
- Okay, okay...
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

163
00:16:30,498 --> 00:16:34,403
- If that's what you felt, that's okay.
- Didn't do, yeah, I'm sorry.

164
00:16:34,503 --> 00:16:36,872
- Okay, no, if that's how you felt...
- Just...

165
00:16:36,972 --> 00:16:41,969
Yeah, I just feel like
it just lacked emotion.

166
00:16:42,778 --> 00:16:45,245
- Yes, Jackie?
- I have something, Mr. Benson.

167
00:16:45,345 --> 00:16:48,985
- Okay, Jackie, go ahead.
- Okay.

168
00:16:49,785 --> 00:16:51,679
Alright.

169
00:16:53,022 --> 00:16:58,307
- Alright, Jackie, go ahead.
- Okay, okay. Sorry, okay.

170
00:16:59,495 --> 00:17:03,232
He never stayed long. Never.
He liked Rosemary's company,

171
00:17:03,332 --> 00:17:06,832
but always seemed to be in a hurry,
like if he had a duel life or something.

172
00:17:06,932 --> 00:17:09,638
But Rosemary didn't mind. She was lonely.

173
00:17:09,738 --> 00:17:13,377
And lonely women cry at night.
Rosemary got sick of it.

174
00:17:13,477 --> 00:17:17,247
That's why she wore her fancy bottle
of perfume and best dress.

175
00:17:17,347 --> 00:17:19,949
She wanted him to caress her
like a mink coat.

176
00:17:20,049 --> 00:17:24,388
But it didn't happen this time.
Rosemary wept after he left.

177
00:17:24,488 --> 00:17:28,358
She thought about swallowing that whole
bottle of pills, but decided not to.

178
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:32,228
She didn't want any man thinking
someone killed themselves for him.

179
00:17:32,328 --> 00:17:35,535
Rosemary, instead, painted
a horizon on a canvas.

180
00:17:35,865 --> 00:17:38,860
It seemed brighter than her future.

181
00:17:41,438 --> 00:17:46,194
- You alright, Jackie?
- Yeah, no, I just get nervous sometimes.

182
00:17:46,294 --> 00:17:48,812
Okay, what do you call this story?

183
00:17:48,912 --> 00:17:53,577
Oh, God. I guess I would call it...

184
00:17:54,477 --> 00:17:57,022
"The girl in apartment 3J".

185
00:17:57,122 --> 00:18:00,983
Alright, does anybody have
any questions for Jackie?

186
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,396
- Yes, Ackley?
- Yes, I was wondering how long

187
00:18:05,496 --> 00:18:08,899
we're gonna have to hear about
these desperate characters of yours.

188
00:18:08,999 --> 00:18:12,570
The same characters from
the last story that you brought in.

189
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:15,673
I mean, when are we gonna hear
something good for a change, something...

190
00:18:15,773 --> 00:18:18,409
- What?
- ...with more levels.

191
00:18:18,509 --> 00:18:20,979
More... I want more... I want more.

192
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:23,248
I'm so sorry, Mr. Herman Melville.

193
00:18:23,348 --> 00:18:26,251
I wouldn't be caught dead
reading Melville.

194
00:18:26,351 --> 00:18:29,955
Excuse me, Ackley?
Ackley, we could do without that.

195
00:18:30,055 --> 00:18:33,959
Well, the whole function
of this creative writing class

196
00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:38,597
is to learn and experience and to grow.

197
00:18:38,697 --> 00:18:40,099
I... yeah, I...

198
00:18:40,199 --> 00:18:44,570
We do not need to criticize
to the extent that you take it to.

199
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:46,901
- Oh...
- Jackie? What do you...

200
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:51,010
What were you feeling when you wrote
this particular passage to your story?

201
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:55,547
"The lonely girl in apartment 3F."

202
00:18:55,647 --> 00:19:00,319
No, it was "The girl in apartment 3J".

203
00:19:00,819 --> 00:19:05,058
But I like that.
"The lonely girl in apartment 3F."

204
00:19:05,158 --> 00:19:08,928
But, she's afraid of being an old maid

205
00:19:09,028 --> 00:19:11,231
and all her friends are wondering...

206
00:19:11,331 --> 00:19:13,666
Okay, Jackie, thank you, thank you.

207
00:19:13,766 --> 00:19:17,504
Does anybody else have
anything they'd like to read?

208
00:19:17,604 --> 00:19:19,363
No?

209
00:19:19,772 --> 00:19:21,200
- I would like to read...
- Yes, Ackley?

210
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,710
I would like to read
my piece for the class.

211
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:26,946
- Can you make it quick?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure.

212
00:19:27,046 --> 00:19:31,385
So, this is an ongoing...
this is part of a trilogy.

213
00:19:31,485 --> 00:19:34,387
I'm... you speak of one and...

214
00:19:34,687 --> 00:19:38,032
Okay, alright, class dismissed!

215
00:19:55,076 --> 00:19:57,111
<i>Frank!</i>

216
00:19:58,011 --> 00:20:00,080
<i>Frank!</i>

217
00:20:01,394 --> 00:20:03,851
<i>Frank! You listening to me?</i>

218
00:20:03,951 --> 00:20:06,087
<i>I know you hear me.</i>

219
00:20:06,187 --> 00:20:08,522
<i>I know you hear me.</i>

220
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:14,290
There are certain things in life.

221
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:17,760
There are certain things that are
passed down in life, you know?

222
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,387
Like father and son.

223
00:21:21,397 --> 00:21:23,724
In our case...

224
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:29,196
headmaster to a...

225
00:21:34,527 --> 00:21:36,353
Orphan.

226
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:40,412
Like...

227
00:21:41,446 --> 00:21:45,622
Like... the love of huntin'.
Yeah, killin'!

228
00:21:46,122 --> 00:21:48,985
That was a good one. That was a good one.

229
00:21:50,561 --> 00:21:54,888
Fishin'? Fishin'? Yeah, fishin' will work.

230
00:21:56,233 --> 00:22:00,704
Yep, today, though,
I'm gonna do some new tradition.

231
00:22:00,804 --> 00:22:05,342
From a long line of traditions
between a headmaster and orphan.

232
00:22:05,442 --> 00:22:08,779
That's called sharing a bottle of bourbon.

233
00:22:08,879 --> 00:22:13,041
It's good. Good for ya.

234
00:22:14,017 --> 00:22:16,020
It's good, you know, I mean...

235
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,923
Take your mind off of things that...

236
00:22:19,223 --> 00:22:23,265
You know, get your mind
off of things that...

237
00:22:23,865 --> 00:22:25,710
bother ya.

238
00:22:26,564 --> 00:22:28,733
About yourself and stuff.

239
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:31,160
Purify your soul!

240
00:22:32,337 --> 00:22:34,463
Got one.

241
00:22:34,806 --> 00:22:38,819
What do you think them priests be doing
in church with their wine? Drunk.

242
00:22:44,782 --> 00:22:46,851
Want a taste?

243
00:22:46,951 --> 00:22:49,779
Here, here, have a taste.

244
00:22:51,456 --> 00:22:55,419
I said to... to have a taste.

245
00:22:56,395 --> 00:22:58,258
Here...

246
00:22:58,358 --> 00:23:00,203
go on.

247
00:23:02,835 --> 00:23:06,439
There you go. Not too strong, huh?

248
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:10,643
Too strong?
Whoa, hey, that's enough there.

249
00:23:10,743 --> 00:23:12,945
Come on, give it back.

250
00:23:13,045 --> 00:23:17,500
Give it back, it's mine.
It's mine, give it back!

251
00:23:20,686 --> 00:23:23,021
It's a gift.

252
00:23:23,121 --> 00:23:26,316
It's a gift to you, it's mine.

253
00:23:39,022 --> 00:23:41,458
Take your pants off.

254
00:24:04,129 --> 00:24:06,232
Yes, may I help you?

255
00:24:06,332 --> 00:24:09,514
I would like to take
your creative writing class.

256
00:24:10,738 --> 00:24:12,540
Great.

257
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,699
Have a seat.

258
00:24:17,111 --> 00:24:18,838
Thanks.

259
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,414
Is there any particular reason you'd like
to join my creative writing class?

260
00:24:23,514 --> 00:24:25,052
No.

261
00:24:25,152 --> 00:24:28,289
- Have you ever written anything before?
- No.

262
00:24:28,389 --> 00:24:32,618
Nothing? No poetry or news articles?

263
00:24:34,562 --> 00:24:37,557
Okay, name?

264
00:24:40,535 --> 00:24:42,202
Oscar.

265
00:24:42,302 --> 00:24:44,004
Oscar.

266
00:24:44,104 --> 00:24:46,975
- Kissel.
- Okay.

267
00:24:47,075 --> 00:24:48,902
Oscar.

268
00:24:50,579 --> 00:24:53,429
A lot of people have come
in here like yourself that...

269
00:24:53,529 --> 00:24:56,585
they have a lot to express
and they don't know how.

270
00:24:56,685 --> 00:24:59,522
Creative writing will help you
with all of that.

271
00:25:00,522 --> 00:25:03,460
I'm gonna give you an assignment.
I want you to go home...

272
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:07,261
and write about something
you know or like,

273
00:25:07,361 --> 00:25:09,819
but make it fictitious.

274
00:25:10,698 --> 00:25:14,936
If you like flying on planes,
write a story about an airline pilot.

275
00:25:15,036 --> 00:25:18,273
Or if you like walking
in the park on Sundays,

276
00:25:18,373 --> 00:25:22,711
write a story about a softball player
that does well in that park on Sundays.

277
00:25:22,811 --> 00:25:27,417
Whatever it is, do it thoroughly.
Get into details.

278
00:25:27,517 --> 00:25:31,521
I want you to make our class believe
in your character, that it's real.

279
00:25:31,621 --> 00:25:35,516
And then we'll feel for them
in their problems, okay?

280
00:25:36,859 --> 00:25:38,361
Softball player?

281
00:26:27,244 --> 00:26:28,980
<i>Goddammit, Frank!</i>

282
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,527
<i>Didn't that sweet ass you got
for a creative writing teacher</i>

283
00:26:32,627 --> 00:26:35,018
<i>tell you to write about stuff you know?</i>

284
00:26:35,118 --> 00:26:40,224
<i>Well, you know about
the darker things in life, don't ya?</i>

285
00:26:40,324 --> 00:26:42,818
<i>So write about that!</i>

286
00:26:45,296 --> 00:26:47,098
<i>Now get back on that typewriter.</i>

287
00:26:47,198 --> 00:26:51,127
<i>And write about that,
you mangy looking bastard.</i>

288
00:26:53,272 --> 00:26:56,608
<i>Come on, I learned you better than that!</i>

289
00:26:57,208 --> 00:26:59,035
<i>Go.</i>

290
00:27:42,655 --> 00:27:46,126
The night never knew
a shade darker than his soul.

291
00:27:46,726 --> 00:27:49,829
That's what everybody used
to say about Frank Stone.

292
00:27:49,929 --> 00:27:53,666
Like a clap of thunder,
he was brought into the world,

293
00:27:53,766 --> 00:27:57,462
and like a flash of lightning, he lived.

294
00:27:58,538 --> 00:28:02,150
And that was pulling off jewelry jobs.

295
00:28:03,409 --> 00:28:07,889
It was his vice.
It gave him comfort, control.

296
00:28:09,382 --> 00:28:12,839
And he would stop at nothing
to get it done.

297
00:28:13,386 --> 00:28:18,301
Nothing. He was as serious
as a heart attack.

298
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:43,382
But how can one live when laughter
can't sooth their soul?

299
00:28:44,251 --> 00:28:47,980
Frank knew he was dead inside, born dead.

300
00:28:50,424 --> 00:28:52,927
Didn't understand why.

301
00:28:53,027 --> 00:28:55,129
Only certain things made sense to him.

302
00:28:55,229 --> 00:28:57,398
Like being found in a dumpster
on Christmas Eve,

303
00:28:57,498 --> 00:29:00,521
with the umbilical cord
wrapped around his neck.

304
00:29:00,935 --> 00:29:02,761
No.

305
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:05,598
That can't be good.

306
00:29:07,241 --> 00:29:12,139
That was clear. That's exactly
what the syndicate looks for, too.

307
00:29:12,314 --> 00:29:13,982
Men with rage.

308
00:29:14,082 --> 00:29:17,069
Frank was the most comfortable
in this kind of environment.

309
00:29:17,169 --> 00:29:19,922
So was his boss, Tough Tony Forte.

310
00:29:20,022 --> 00:29:22,758
A local punk gangster with a long arm...

311
00:29:22,858 --> 00:29:27,162
Who always gave Frank work...
whenever the need would arise.

312
00:29:27,262 --> 00:29:31,399
And fortunately for Frank, that need
came about on a regular basis.

313
00:29:31,499 --> 00:29:33,869
He couldn't wait to get that call.

314
00:29:33,969 --> 00:29:37,205
It's the only time
Frank seemed to come alive.

315
00:29:37,305 --> 00:29:42,409
That was just the way things
were in his world. Hard, cold.

316
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:44,880
That was Frank Stone.

317
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:47,382
That's all I got so far.

318
00:29:47,482 --> 00:29:50,244
Thank you, Oscar, that was interesting.

319
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:55,683
Does anybody here
have any questions for Oscar?

320
00:29:57,994 --> 00:29:59,763
Yes, Ackley?

321
00:29:59,863 --> 00:30:02,465
I'm sorry, but that sounded like a...

322
00:30:02,565 --> 00:30:05,702
gangster movie
from the 1940's or something.

323
00:30:05,802 --> 00:30:08,772
You know,
it was like just so totally fake.

324
00:30:08,872 --> 00:30:12,341
And, like, no one in real life
sounds like Frank Stone.

325
00:30:12,441 --> 00:30:15,044
Except, since World War II or something.

326
00:30:15,144 --> 00:30:20,483
Philip... Ackley, once again,
we are not here to judge.

327
00:30:20,583 --> 00:30:23,677
We're here to analyze and interpret.

328
00:30:25,688 --> 00:30:28,726
Does anybody else
have any questions for Oscar?

329
00:30:28,826 --> 00:30:30,985
Yes, Jackie.

330
00:30:31,461 --> 00:30:36,091
Well, I thought it was good.
I really liked it.

331
00:30:36,901 --> 00:30:39,536
It reminded me of one
of those crime novels.

332
00:30:39,636 --> 00:30:42,506
You know what I'm talking about?
Like they sell in the bus depots.

333
00:30:42,606 --> 00:30:46,621
You know, those things that they're
supposed to take your mind off the journey

334
00:30:46,721 --> 00:30:49,613
you're about to go on... you know.

335
00:30:49,713 --> 00:30:54,618
I love those things. I was once on this
bus trip from Virginia to New Mexico...

336
00:30:54,718 --> 00:30:57,888
Yes, yeah, thank you. Thank you, Jackie.

337
00:30:57,988 --> 00:31:00,916
Does anybody else
have any questions for Oscar?

338
00:31:02,392 --> 00:31:05,488
Okay, if... well, class dismissed.

339
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:24,950
- <i>Hey, Frank?
</i>- Yeah?

340
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,944
<i>You can go ahead with that operation.</i>

341
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:36,661
The Grobe brothers.
Vic and Ronnie, I presume.

342
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:39,931
We're here. Start talking.

343
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:43,727
I like your manners. Sit down.

344
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:51,678
This job we're gonna pull
is in the diamond district.

345
00:31:52,178 --> 00:31:55,481
This place is an upstairs distribution.

346
00:31:55,781 --> 00:31:58,885
The way it works,
you guys got to "go-between".

347
00:31:58,985 --> 00:32:01,453
He carries the diamonds down
in a little briefcase.

348
00:32:01,553 --> 00:32:04,423
He doesn't take the elevator,
he uses the stairs.

349
00:32:04,523 --> 00:32:08,227
It's Bonafide, I checked it out.
That's what will make it happen.

350
00:32:08,627 --> 00:32:12,629
- How many stones will he be carrying?
- 150K, minimum.

351
00:32:13,565 --> 00:32:18,195
- What's our cut?
- It's a flat rate. 25 grand each.

352
00:32:19,505 --> 00:32:21,741
25?

353
00:32:21,841 --> 00:32:24,274
What are you, crazy or something?

354
00:32:24,544 --> 00:32:27,514
We split it 3 ways
or we ain't interested.

355
00:32:27,614 --> 00:32:29,983
Look, these diamonds, they're rare.

356
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:32,452
No fence in New York
is gonna deal with them.

357
00:32:32,552 --> 00:32:35,806
All you need to know is
it's gonna take time and money.

358
00:32:35,906 --> 00:32:39,434
And that's the rate, 25k.

359
00:32:42,429 --> 00:32:44,164
Nah.

360
00:32:44,264 --> 00:32:46,233
Split it three ways or nothing.

361
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:48,602
Nothing it is.

362
00:32:49,002 --> 00:32:51,839
You know, I was told
you guys were professionals.

363
00:32:51,939 --> 00:32:54,532
I guess I was told wrong.

364
00:32:57,578 --> 00:32:59,372
Sit.

365
00:33:08,389 --> 00:33:11,826
- Does that mean you're in?
- Yeah.

366
00:33:11,926 --> 00:33:15,529
- Alright, you got any other questions?
- Yeah, I got one question.

367
00:33:15,629 --> 00:33:18,232
Me and my brother, we heard
a couple of things about you.

368
00:33:18,332 --> 00:33:20,969
We need you to clear it up for us.

369
00:33:21,069 --> 00:33:25,574
- You heard some things like what?
- That whoever works these jobs of yours...

370
00:33:26,174 --> 00:33:28,734
they never get seen again.

371
00:33:30,044 --> 00:33:32,613
Let me tell you something, fellas.

372
00:33:32,713 --> 00:33:37,252
People talk all the time,
they talk for a lot of reasons.

373
00:33:37,352 --> 00:33:40,956
Envy, jealousy, greed.

374
00:33:41,056 --> 00:33:45,761
All you need to know is if you're square
with me, I'll be square with you.

375
00:33:46,261 --> 00:33:48,555
I'll be in touch.

376
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,483
- Hi!
- How you doing?

377
00:34:08,583 --> 00:34:11,821
You're new here. I'm Jackie.

378
00:34:12,721 --> 00:34:15,225
Well, actually,
we met the other day, kind of.

379
00:34:15,325 --> 00:34:17,961
Yeah, what's yours again?

380
00:34:18,061 --> 00:34:21,156
- What?
- Your name, dumb-dumb.

381
00:34:22,532 --> 00:34:25,702
Oscar. Oscar Kissell.

382
00:34:26,169 --> 00:34:30,206
So, like, what are you hoping to be?
A mystery writer or something?

383
00:34:30,806 --> 00:34:32,809
I don't know.

384
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:35,545
Oh, my God, is that typed?

385
00:34:35,645 --> 00:34:37,380
Do you...

386
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:41,017
You used the typewriter. I didn't
even know they were around anymore.

387
00:34:41,117 --> 00:34:45,456
- I like typewriters. I mean, I like things...
- Hey, what's that? Oh!

388
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:49,593
Gotcha.

389
00:34:50,093 --> 00:34:53,764
Okay, class, everybody take their seats.

390
00:34:53,864 --> 00:34:55,957
We're gonna start.

391
00:35:00,604 --> 00:35:03,089
<i>Monday, late afternoon.</i>

392
00:35:04,675 --> 00:35:06,710
<i>Diamond district.</i>

393
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:10,639
<i>And Frank Stone gets ready.</i>

394
00:35:14,818 --> 00:35:17,479
<i>A large Romanian man...</i>

395
00:35:17,579 --> 00:35:19,810
<i>comes out of an office...</i>

396
00:35:20,524 --> 00:35:25,129
with a briefcase full of bling.

397
00:35:25,229 --> 00:35:28,817
<i>But, today, that large Romanian...</i>

398
00:35:28,917 --> 00:35:32,091
<i>gonna be in for a surprise.</i>

399
00:35:40,545 --> 00:35:42,981
You two midgets think you can rob me?

400
00:35:43,081 --> 00:35:45,208
Try it.

401
00:35:57,061 --> 00:35:59,998
- Jesus Christ, there's a fortune in here!
- Nice!

402
00:36:00,098 --> 00:36:02,792
Grab the bag, let's get out of here.

403
00:36:06,438 --> 00:36:08,674
I think there's only enough
for me and my brother.

404
00:36:08,774 --> 00:36:11,502
- What?
- You heard me, you dirty double...

405
00:36:13,779 --> 00:36:16,549
<i>It's called the double-cross.</i>

406
00:36:16,649 --> 00:36:19,243
<i>Or the dirty double-cross.</i>

407
00:36:19,885 --> 00:36:25,058
Someone turning on you is one of the
unfortunate hazards in this line of work.

408
00:36:25,158 --> 00:36:29,629
Luckily for Frank,
he's always expecting it.

409
00:36:30,029 --> 00:36:32,522
Wow, that's interesting.

410
00:36:33,532 --> 00:36:38,929
It really is getting more and more
cohesive, Oscar. Keep it up.

411
00:36:52,118 --> 00:36:55,747
Hey! Hey, Oscar!

412
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,483
Hey!

413
00:37:02,062 --> 00:37:05,657
Well, I was just wondering
if you wanted to get a coffee?

414
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:11,630
So, I just wanted to know
what goes on in that head of yours.

415
00:37:13,173 --> 00:37:14,541
What do you mean?

416
00:37:14,641 --> 00:37:19,015
Well, how do you get
your stuff to sound so real?

417
00:37:19,115 --> 00:37:23,050
Like... I don't know, I just...

418
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:27,147
I feel like I'm in the same world
as your characters.

419
00:37:27,247 --> 00:37:30,225
Like... It's...

420
00:37:30,325 --> 00:37:34,386
I don't know. I just write
whatever comes into my head.

421
00:37:36,764 --> 00:37:41,761
Wow, I mean, Frank Stone is so cold.

422
00:37:42,261 --> 00:37:44,605
Well, I mean...

423
00:37:44,705 --> 00:37:48,000
He has a lot of demons in his past.

424
00:37:49,043 --> 00:37:52,104
They're gonna stay there
until he gets rid of 'em.

425
00:37:53,798 --> 00:37:55,991
He doesn't trust anyone.

426
00:37:57,218 --> 00:37:59,645
That's how he survives.

427
00:38:02,324 --> 00:38:05,779
Have you always had
this kind of imagination?

428
00:38:05,879 --> 00:38:08,964
Did you read those recommended books
the teacher told us about?

429
00:38:09,064 --> 00:38:11,433
I didn't read anything.

430
00:38:11,833 --> 00:38:13,969
You're so serious!

431
00:38:14,069 --> 00:38:18,465
But you're modest, too.
Can you pass me the sugar?

432
00:38:21,109 --> 00:38:22,569
Boo!

433
00:38:23,912 --> 00:38:26,206
Oh, sorry.

434
00:38:35,424 --> 00:38:38,585
Thanks for giving me a ride home, Oscar.

435
00:38:39,362 --> 00:38:41,689
That was nice.

436
00:38:43,132 --> 00:38:44,926
Well...

437
00:38:46,102 --> 00:38:51,598
When did you start dressing
like a little tugboat captain?

438
00:38:55,011 --> 00:38:58,673
You know, do you like the open sea?

439
00:39:01,984 --> 00:39:03,553
Hello?

440
00:39:03,653 --> 00:39:07,289
Yeah, you... you don't give that much.

441
00:39:07,389 --> 00:39:10,017
You really don't talk that much.

442
00:39:19,937 --> 00:39:21,071
Are you hungry?

443
00:39:21,171 --> 00:39:25,125
Why don't you come upstairs and let me
make you a fluffernutter sandwich.

444
00:39:25,976 --> 00:39:27,645
Have you ever had one?

445
00:39:27,745 --> 00:39:32,080
I can tell you haven't had one, cause
your eyes didn't light up when I said it.

446
00:39:33,984 --> 00:39:35,911
You're missing out.

447
00:39:39,289 --> 00:39:41,158
Do you want a beer?

448
00:39:41,258 --> 00:39:44,127
No thanks. I don't drink.

449
00:39:44,227 --> 00:39:46,488
You don't drink?

450
00:39:49,032 --> 00:39:52,803
What are you, a boy scout or something?
How about a glass of milk?

451
00:39:52,903 --> 00:39:55,131
That sounds good.

452
00:40:03,214 --> 00:40:05,271
Here you go.

453
00:40:10,054 --> 00:40:12,524
What's the matter, Oscar?

454
00:40:12,924 --> 00:40:17,061
I don't know.
Something strange just happened.

455
00:40:17,161 --> 00:40:18,964
What?

456
00:40:19,464 --> 00:40:21,600
The horse on the glass here...

457
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:25,761
reminded me of something that
happened to me when I was a kid.

458
00:40:26,971 --> 00:40:30,242
You know, I was raised in an orphanage.

459
00:40:30,842 --> 00:40:34,447
And one day, me and all the other boys

460
00:40:34,547 --> 00:40:37,450
we were all taken on a field trip.

461
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:40,375
But when the bus got there...

462
00:40:40,475 --> 00:40:42,988
the first thing that I saw...

463
00:40:43,088 --> 00:40:46,326
was this beautiful gray horse.

464
00:40:46,826 --> 00:40:49,061
So I approached the horse really slowly

465
00:40:49,161 --> 00:40:54,758
and I was talking to him softly,
the way a kid would.

466
00:40:55,401 --> 00:40:58,170
And all of a sudden,
the horse, he went nuts.

467
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:00,272
I mean, he went totally haywire.

468
00:41:00,372 --> 00:41:03,947
Started jumping up on his hind legs...

469
00:41:04,047 --> 00:41:05,395
kicking.

470
00:41:05,495 --> 00:41:09,921
He broke free from the chain
and he started to scare the other horses.

471
00:41:10,021 --> 00:41:13,954
Well, horses do weird things
like that sometimes.

472
00:41:14,254 --> 00:41:17,658
Yeah, well, the headmaster,
he got so angry...

473
00:41:17,758 --> 00:41:20,761
that he grabbed me
and he started to beat me publicly,

474
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:23,079
right in front of the other boys.

475
00:41:23,179 --> 00:41:26,082
That headmaster sounds like such a jerk!

476
00:41:26,332 --> 00:41:29,907
And after that, all the kids,
they laughed at me.

477
00:41:30,236 --> 00:41:34,340
They humiliated me, mocked me.

478
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,977
And I'll tell you that headmaster...

479
00:41:37,577 --> 00:41:39,580
after that,
he never missed an opportunity...

480
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:43,279
Let's change the subject,
talk about something else.

481
00:41:57,164 --> 00:41:59,166
Hey, Oscar?

482
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:06,474
- Isn't it funny?
- I'm leaving.

483
00:42:06,574 --> 00:42:08,776
Oh, come on. What's the matter with you?

484
00:42:08,876 --> 00:42:14,213
Listen, you may think everything is a joke.
But me, I take everything seriously.

485
00:42:14,313 --> 00:42:18,319
- And I don't appreciate you mocking me.
- I wasn't mocking you.

486
00:42:18,419 --> 00:42:22,148
What's the matter with you? I...

487
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:35,696
Oh, look who it is!

488
00:42:37,405 --> 00:42:40,242
It's Mr. Personality!

489
00:42:40,342 --> 00:42:43,779
He came here to brighten up
everybody's day, now didn't ya?

490
00:42:43,879 --> 00:42:46,449
I got a question for you, scumbag.

491
00:42:46,549 --> 00:42:51,545
How come you make everybody sick
at the very sight of you?

492
00:42:53,989 --> 00:42:57,259
You got the personality of a cobra
and I've had it up to here with that.

493
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:59,762
Come on, Vinny, knock it off.

494
00:42:59,862 --> 00:43:01,864
Sit down!

495
00:43:01,964 --> 00:43:04,993
You have to excuse Vinny, Frank.

496
00:43:06,102 --> 00:43:08,938
Anyway, how are you doing today, Frank?

497
00:43:09,038 --> 00:43:12,008
- Doing good, Tony.
- Can I get you anything to eat?

498
00:43:12,108 --> 00:43:14,944
You don't have to be shy, we have
plenty of food. More coming out.

499
00:43:15,044 --> 00:43:16,846
No thanks, I'm not hungry.

500
00:43:17,346 --> 00:43:19,215
No?

501
00:43:19,315 --> 00:43:22,347
Give him his freakin' money,
let him get out of here.

502
00:43:29,192 --> 00:43:32,428
- Thanks.
- Frankie, Frankie.

503
00:43:32,528 --> 00:43:36,900
You know, not for nothing,
but we offer you food all the time.

504
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,271
And never once... once,
do you ever sit down and eat with us.

505
00:43:41,371 --> 00:43:46,335
What's the matter? My gesture of
friendship doesn't agree with you?

506
00:43:47,878 --> 00:43:51,714
Look at me
when I'm talking to you, Frankie.

507
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:56,487
Now I want to know why you
think you're too good for us.

508
00:43:56,587 --> 00:44:01,859
It's not that, Tony. It's just, you know,
I got some place I got to be in a hurry.

509
00:44:01,959 --> 00:44:05,830
Hurry? Where you got to be, Frankie?

510
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:08,065
- Somewhere.
- Frank...

511
00:44:08,165 --> 00:44:11,702
the only place you should ever be
in a hurry to get to is home.

512
00:44:11,802 --> 00:44:15,005
Cause home is where the family is.
Here, look, let me show this.

513
00:44:15,105 --> 00:44:17,574
This is my family, alright?

514
00:44:17,674 --> 00:44:21,847
This is my wife, my kids when
they were younger, my grandkids.

515
00:44:21,947 --> 00:44:25,597
And this... this is the most
cherished picture I have of my father,

516
00:44:25,697 --> 00:44:28,025
God rest his soul.

517
00:44:29,354 --> 00:44:33,555
You know, I loved him more
than any son ever loved a father.

518
00:44:35,493 --> 00:44:37,095
What about you, Frankie?

519
00:44:37,195 --> 00:44:41,874
Do you have any pictures
of loved ones you'd like to show us?

520
00:44:43,034 --> 00:44:45,704
No? Why not?

521
00:44:45,804 --> 00:44:50,072
You're always in such a hurry,
I would think that you had hundreds,

522
00:44:50,172 --> 00:44:53,069
hundreds of pictures to show us.

523
00:44:56,181 --> 00:45:00,755
Now the next time that I ask you
to sit down and eat with us...

524
00:45:00,855 --> 00:45:03,028
make sure you have the time.

525
00:45:03,128 --> 00:45:05,858
Alright, now get the hell out of here.

526
00:45:05,958 --> 00:45:08,795
- Thanks, Tony.
- What did you say?

527
00:45:08,895 --> 00:45:11,355
What did you just mumble?

528
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:14,157
I said thanks, Tony.

529
00:45:16,468 --> 00:45:19,063
So, anyway, about this weekend...

530
00:45:36,289 --> 00:45:39,893
<i>There's nothing more frustrating than
a man who just can't express himself.</i>

531
00:45:39,993 --> 00:45:43,088
You know, tell you how he feels.

532
00:45:43,864 --> 00:45:46,704
That makes him no different than a...

533
00:45:47,551 --> 00:45:51,538
lamp. Or a clay pigeon.

534
00:45:51,938 --> 00:45:55,932
Yeah, clay pigeon,
waiting to get blown up into pieces.

535
00:45:57,710 --> 00:46:02,370
Maybe that's why. Maybe that's
the root behind Frank Stone's...

536
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:04,380
rage.

537
00:46:05,953 --> 00:46:09,657
<i>He just lives, second to second.</i>

538
00:46:10,057 --> 00:46:13,453
<i>Minute to minute. Murder to murder.</i>

539
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:17,065
<i>Like an alcoholic.</i>

540
00:46:17,365 --> 00:46:19,926
Just one day at a time.

541
00:46:23,337 --> 00:46:25,564
That's my boy.

542
00:46:29,644 --> 00:46:32,686
<i>Bright eyes and colors</i>

543
00:46:32,786 --> 00:46:36,417
<i>Are blind again</i>

544
00:46:36,517 --> 00:46:40,418
<i>Haven't seen my love in</i>

545
00:46:40,518 --> 00:46:42,980
<i>God knows when</i>

546
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:45,972
<i>He went away</i>

547
00:46:46,072 --> 00:46:50,197
<i>Now I'm all by myself</i>

548
00:46:50,297 --> 00:46:52,826
<i>All of this heart aching</i>

549
00:46:52,926 --> 00:46:56,509
<i>Is affecting my head</i>

550
00:46:56,809 --> 00:46:59,199
<i>Oh, no</i>

551
00:47:03,145 --> 00:47:06,492
<i>I've been so alone</i>

552
00:47:06,592 --> 00:47:12,142
<i>Waiting for you to get back home</i>

553
00:47:17,559 --> 00:47:20,766
<i>No more good mornings</i>

554
00:47:20,866 --> 00:47:24,500
<i>Or I love you</i>

555
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:27,636
<i>Never thought my nightmares</i>

556
00:47:27,737 --> 00:47:31,285
<i>Would be so true...</i>

557
00:47:32,585 --> 00:47:37,880
<i>All this seems to fight for me</i>

558
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:40,800
<i>But all I ever wanted</i>

559
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:47,481
<i>Was for us to be alone</i>

560
00:47:51,027 --> 00:47:56,399
<i>I've been so alone, yeah, waiting for you</i>

561
00:47:56,499 --> 00:48:00,729
<i>I waited for you to come back home</i>

562
00:48:04,507 --> 00:48:07,985
<i>Yeah, I'm so alone</i>

563
00:48:08,085 --> 00:48:10,641
<i>I waited for you</i>

564
00:48:10,741 --> 00:48:15,311
<i>But now you're gone</i>

565
00:48:32,136 --> 00:48:36,373
Wasn't she great? Chelsea, let's give
it up for Chelsea. Great girl, nice act.

566
00:48:36,473 --> 00:48:41,837
And now, next, he's your favorite
ventriloquist, Mr. John Peasy.

567
00:48:43,781 --> 00:48:46,418
Hey, folks, my name is John Peasy,
this is my friend Smokey.

568
00:48:46,518 --> 00:48:50,222
Holy shit, they're all white! Okay,
we have a great crowd of people here.

569
00:48:50,322 --> 00:48:52,991
Yeah, they look good, this look good,
I like it. Yeah, we got a good crowd.

570
00:48:53,091 --> 00:48:56,528
I'm the only black guy here.
It looks like my trial.

571
00:48:56,928 --> 00:48:59,931
Looking good, looking good, looking good,
looking good! I like this crowd, yeah, yeah.

572
00:49:00,031 --> 00:49:03,335
If you like white people, yeah.
Hate them white men shit.

573
00:49:03,435 --> 00:49:06,738
Oh, yeah, now...
Hold up, where you going, brother?

574
00:49:06,838 --> 00:49:08,790
Sit the hell down,
where the hell you going?

575
00:49:08,890 --> 00:49:11,042
I hate when a white guy gets up
in the middle of a show like that.

576
00:49:11,142 --> 00:49:15,647
Sit the hell down, cracker ass. Sit the hell
down. I'm in the middle of my working here.

577
00:49:15,747 --> 00:49:17,911
Don't sit there and get up in the middle.
I'm working here.

578
00:49:18,011 --> 00:49:19,985
Don't pick on the guy.
He's a mean-looking guy.

579
00:49:20,085 --> 00:49:21,998
- What do you mean?
- He looks like a killer.

580
00:49:22,098 --> 00:49:25,949
Yeah, killer, I'll kick his ass.
Homo, sit the hell down.

581
00:49:26,759 --> 00:49:29,029
- Don't pick on the guy.
- I don't give a shit! I see you staring.

582
00:49:29,129 --> 00:49:31,464
Let's have a staring contest, go.

583
00:49:31,564 --> 00:49:35,334
This is comedy. You don't just get up
and walk out in the middle of a show.

584
00:49:35,434 --> 00:49:36,769
Alright, that's enough, that's enough.

585
00:49:36,869 --> 00:49:38,772
Why don't you say something to the guy
that would make him feel good?

586
00:49:38,872 --> 00:49:42,165
The way he looks,
attention K-Mart shopper.

587
00:49:42,475 --> 00:49:45,845
He's a loser,
I can't stand his white cracker ass.

588
00:49:46,445 --> 00:49:49,415
That's right, folks, you can laugh
all you want. I'll kick his ass right now.

589
00:49:49,515 --> 00:49:51,884
Loser, loser, loser.

590
00:49:51,984 --> 00:49:54,378
And you're white, cracker ass.

591
00:50:00,059 --> 00:50:04,398
Hey! This was just a joke, man,
I was only kiddin' ya!

592
00:50:04,498 --> 00:50:06,291
No, no!

593
00:50:14,341 --> 00:50:17,844
This week, Olivia's mailbox
wasn't empty as usual.

594
00:50:17,944 --> 00:50:20,880
This week, it contained
one of those lovely pink slips

595
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:24,183
that indicated she had a package
at the front desk.

596
00:50:24,283 --> 00:50:28,455
The clerk was so excited for her.
Olivia, you have mail today!

597
00:50:28,555 --> 00:50:30,978
Politely, she smiled and took the package.

598
00:50:31,078 --> 00:50:33,627
It was a 5 dollar flat rate box.

599
00:50:33,727 --> 00:50:38,299
Olivia was reminded of how much
her mother loved sending flat rate boxes.

600
00:50:38,399 --> 00:50:41,747
Each week in college, Olivia would receive
one of these packages,

601
00:50:41,847 --> 00:50:45,978
a veritable treavure...
treasure trove of candy, costume,

602
00:50:46,078 --> 00:50:50,511
jewelry, school supplies,
anything a college girl could desire.

603
00:50:50,611 --> 00:50:54,315
The package that she was handed today
was considerately different.

604
00:50:54,415 --> 00:50:57,752
On the outside, it looked like a standard
5 dollar flat rate box.

605
00:50:57,852 --> 00:51:00,588
But the contents had a macabre difference.

606
00:51:00,688 --> 00:51:03,950
This package contained her mother's ashes.

607
00:51:08,763 --> 00:51:11,699
You really have tapped
into something very personal.

608
00:51:11,799 --> 00:51:15,437
Now, class, what we can
take from Mario's story

609
00:51:15,537 --> 00:51:17,873
is don't be afraid to be deeply personal.

610
00:51:17,973 --> 00:51:20,934
Oscar, please come on time!

611
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:26,916
Okay, Jackie, you had something
you wanted to read?

612
00:51:27,416 --> 00:51:29,209
Yeah.

613
00:51:33,089 --> 00:51:34,981
Alright.

614
00:51:35,991 --> 00:51:40,329
Rosemary thought she was different.
She was always told that.

615
00:51:40,429 --> 00:51:45,334
By her father, by her mother,
by her classmates.

616
00:51:45,434 --> 00:51:48,838
She grew up thinking bad about herself.

617
00:51:48,938 --> 00:51:52,675
That's why she tried to slit
her wrists many times.

618
00:51:52,775 --> 00:51:56,079
But she always managed to find
a way to get through it.

619
00:51:56,179 --> 00:51:59,816
She thought she had met someone
who could relate to her.

620
00:51:59,916 --> 00:52:02,152
Another tortured soul.

621
00:52:02,252 --> 00:52:05,122
But this person was more
than a tortured soul.

622
00:52:05,222 --> 00:52:09,159
He also felt the need
to be hateful and cruel.

623
00:52:09,259 --> 00:52:12,929
He didn't want to change himself
or discover who he really was.

624
00:52:13,029 --> 00:52:15,598
He didn't want to move on
from a dark past.

625
00:52:15,698 --> 00:52:20,137
He wanted to relive it every day.
He was pure nasty.

626
00:52:20,237 --> 00:52:23,165
I hate him, I hate him.

627
00:52:26,675 --> 00:52:32,299
I... Jackie, I must say you've really
tapped into something very personal

628
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:34,810
to get this latest work.

629
00:52:37,488 --> 00:52:39,982
Anybody have any questions?

630
00:52:40,791 --> 00:52:42,626
Ackley?

631
00:52:42,726 --> 00:52:44,929
I have to say, I thought...

632
00:52:45,029 --> 00:52:46,889
Oscar!

633
00:52:48,266 --> 00:52:51,034
Oscar, please wait outside.

634
00:52:51,134 --> 00:52:52,895
Alright.

635
00:53:01,145 --> 00:53:03,038
Okay.

636
00:53:05,783 --> 00:53:07,743
That was weird.

637
00:53:09,121 --> 00:53:12,049
Alright, go to Jimmy's on 10th street.
You know the way.

638
00:53:15,894 --> 00:53:19,970
What the hell is that banana head
doing over there? Pull over, pull over.

639
00:53:24,603 --> 00:53:26,462
Stop.

640
00:53:32,344 --> 00:53:35,672
What the hell is Frank Stone
doing in this neighborhood?

641
00:53:47,527 --> 00:53:50,401
Wait up a second, I want to talk to you.

642
00:53:52,998 --> 00:53:55,735
Look, I'm sorry that I spoke
to you that way.

643
00:53:55,835 --> 00:53:58,838
Alright, I made a mistake.
I thought you were making fun of me.

644
00:53:59,238 --> 00:54:01,766
What do you want, Oscar?

645
00:54:02,258 --> 00:54:04,927
There's something I gotta tell you.

646
00:54:05,177 --> 00:54:07,647
Alright, my name isn't Oscar.

647
00:54:07,747 --> 00:54:10,040
It's Frank Stone.

648
00:54:11,183 --> 00:54:13,453
Your character?

649
00:54:13,553 --> 00:54:16,088
And I work for Anthony Forte.

650
00:54:16,188 --> 00:54:18,157
Tough Tony is real?

651
00:54:18,257 --> 00:54:22,710
It's all for real, alright?
That's what I am, I'm a hood.

652
00:54:25,031 --> 00:54:27,734
- Why are you telling me this?
- I don't know.

653
00:54:27,834 --> 00:54:31,697
I just feel like my head's
gonna explode if I don't tell you.

654
00:54:39,446 --> 00:54:43,184
Just please, just leave me alone.

655
00:54:43,284 --> 00:54:46,712
Please, I'm sorry.

656
00:54:47,138 --> 00:54:50,231
- I'm sorry.
- Please just stay away from me.

657
00:55:03,505 --> 00:55:05,965
What the hell was that all about?

658
00:55:07,942 --> 00:55:10,037
Wait here, I want to go see
what's going on.

659
00:55:30,031 --> 00:55:32,867
Did I almost get a smile out of you?

660
00:55:32,967 --> 00:55:34,827
Almost.

661
00:55:38,372 --> 00:55:41,134
Frank, how come you never smile?

662
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:48,651
Can I ask you something? You never
once told me anything about yourself.

663
00:55:48,751 --> 00:55:53,203
Well, you know everything about me,
but I don't know anything about you.

664
00:55:55,624 --> 00:55:58,594
I'm just not that open about myself.

665
00:55:58,694 --> 00:56:02,265
- My private self, that is.
- Yeah?

666
00:56:02,965 --> 00:56:05,568
Is that why you joke around so much?

667
00:56:05,668 --> 00:56:08,337
To hide that private self?

668
00:56:08,437 --> 00:56:11,499
No, that's not why.

669
00:56:14,577 --> 00:56:18,359
You know, if you don't want
to talk about it, it's okay.

670
00:56:21,785 --> 00:56:23,475
Well, I...

671
00:56:23,575 --> 00:56:29,509
I married this really rich guy
that I didn't even love.

672
00:56:29,859 --> 00:56:33,888
But I figured I'd have everything.

673
00:56:35,732 --> 00:56:37,502
But...

674
00:56:38,384 --> 00:56:42,359
it wasn't really enough.

675
00:56:42,459 --> 00:56:45,509
But then we had a beautiful daughter.

676
00:56:45,609 --> 00:56:48,445
Beautiful, beautiful daughter.

677
00:56:48,545 --> 00:56:50,374
And...

678
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:56,088
my husband left me and...

679
00:56:58,389 --> 00:57:01,493
He got full custody of her...

680
00:57:01,593 --> 00:57:04,680
and I can't even visit her.

681
00:57:06,564 --> 00:57:11,336
So you see,
all I want to do is just call her.

682
00:57:11,436 --> 00:57:15,765
Tell her I'm sorry and that I love her.

683
00:57:20,144 --> 00:57:23,888
- But I can't.
- You listen to me.

684
00:57:25,015 --> 00:57:27,552
I got to go right now.

685
00:57:27,652 --> 00:57:31,255
- Where are you going?
- I got to go.

686
00:57:31,355 --> 00:57:33,881
But when I get back...

687
00:57:34,281 --> 00:57:38,449
you and me, I'm gonna take you
to see your daughter.

688
00:57:39,598 --> 00:57:41,700
But she doesn't even know me.

689
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:45,604
- She doesn't know me at all anymore.
- She knows who you are.

690
00:57:45,704 --> 00:57:50,242
And believe me, there's no time
like the present to get reacquainted.

691
00:57:50,342 --> 00:57:53,311
Everything's gonna be all right, Jackie.

692
00:57:53,411 --> 00:57:57,908
You'll see. I'll be back in a few hours.

693
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:17,069
Hey, there he is!

694
00:58:17,169 --> 00:58:19,763
- Frankie!
- Frank!

695
00:58:20,206 --> 00:58:22,842
- Hey, Frank, have a seat.
- How you doing, Frank?

696
00:58:22,942 --> 00:58:24,977
How you doing, fellas?

697
00:58:25,077 --> 00:58:27,780
Today is your lucky day, Frank.

698
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:31,684
We got a call from our boys out in Vegas
and they need someone from back east

699
00:58:31,784 --> 00:58:33,951
to run the security at the casino

700
00:58:34,051 --> 00:58:38,290
and to oversee all the used jewelry
business they got out there.

701
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:41,494
And I couldn't think
of anybody but you, Frank.

702
00:58:41,594 --> 00:58:44,821
- Me?
- Yeah.

703
00:58:45,264 --> 00:58:48,769
Well, for how long?

704
00:58:49,069 --> 00:58:51,339
How long? For as long as it takes, Frank.

705
00:58:51,439 --> 00:58:55,096
You're gonna be making
a cool 200 grand there.

706
00:58:55,543 --> 00:58:58,771
- 200,000 dollars?
- Yeah.

707
00:59:01,448 --> 00:59:05,786
- That's a lot of money, Tony.
- Yeah, you go out there, you work hard,

708
00:59:05,886 --> 00:59:08,489
you find one of those
show girls, you know...

709
00:59:08,589 --> 00:59:10,423
settle down with her a little bit

710
00:59:10,523 --> 00:59:13,861
and be happy for once in your life,
you miserable bastard!

711
00:59:13,961 --> 00:59:17,490
You know, I mean 200 grand
make anybody happy, right?

712
00:59:21,468 --> 00:59:23,895
When am I supposed to leave?

713
00:59:24,637 --> 00:59:27,233
First flight tomorrow.

714
00:59:31,179 --> 00:59:34,282
Hey, what's the matter?
You seem disinterested, Frank.

715
00:59:34,382 --> 00:59:36,949
No, that's not it. It's just that...

716
00:59:37,049 --> 00:59:40,955
you know, I got a little something
I gotta take care of with someone.

717
00:59:41,055 --> 00:59:45,247
You know, I'll definitely
make the flight, Tony.

718
00:59:46,427 --> 00:59:49,197
- Okay.
- Is there anything else?

719
00:59:49,497 --> 00:59:52,533
Yeah, just one more little thing.

720
00:59:52,633 --> 00:59:56,173
When you get out there,
I was just wondering...

721
00:59:56,273 --> 01:00:00,103
if you're gonna write any more stories
about me and my operation.

722
01:00:02,811 --> 01:00:05,385
Kill that rat bastard!

723
01:00:20,162 --> 01:00:23,766
No, no, no, Vinny, wait a minute, wait
a minute. Maybe we shouldn't do it here.

724
01:00:23,866 --> 01:00:27,847
You know what? Just take him down
to the warehouse and chop him up.

725
01:00:51,895 --> 01:00:54,422
Come on, let's go chop him up.

726
01:00:57,934 --> 01:00:59,893
Pop the trunk.

727
01:00:59,993 --> 01:01:02,695
- Who's this?
- Who's that?

728
01:01:03,206 --> 01:01:05,032
Hey, fellas.

729
01:01:05,375 --> 01:01:08,912
Can you tell me how to get
to the 59 street bridge?

730
01:01:09,012 --> 01:01:12,215
You keep going straight. If you hit
the water, it means you missed the bridge.

731
01:01:12,315 --> 01:01:14,585
Hey, man, your humor flows like molasses.

732
01:01:14,685 --> 01:01:17,553
And if you keep going straight
and you hit water,

733
01:01:17,653 --> 01:01:20,024
it means you missed the bridge.

734
01:01:20,925 --> 01:01:23,151
Call for backup.

735
01:01:24,061 --> 01:01:26,154
Tell him in Italian.

736
01:01:30,768 --> 01:01:33,671
Hey, why don't you keep smoking?
Or burn out.

737
01:01:33,771 --> 01:01:37,041
Central B5 requesting an additional unit.

738
01:01:55,927 --> 01:01:59,381
- Alright, call it in.
- 20 boy central, requesting one addition.

739
01:01:59,481 --> 01:02:01,397
<i>5 boy 4 by on there?</i>

740
01:02:04,336 --> 01:02:08,632
<i>Paging Dr. Bender.
Paging Dr. Bender, please.</i>

741
01:02:16,648 --> 01:02:19,877
<i>Dr. Bender to the mental ward, please.</i>

742
01:02:35,267 --> 01:02:37,704
How you doing, Frank?

743
01:02:38,104 --> 01:02:40,764
Mind if we talk to you for a minute?

744
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:50,416
I don't think he heard us.

745
01:02:50,516 --> 01:02:53,077
Hey, Frank, can you hear us?

746
01:02:55,121 --> 01:02:59,417
How you feeling, Frank?
Been in a coma for a few weeks.

747
01:03:01,660 --> 01:03:04,430
I'm Detective Manteiga,
this Detective Maas.

748
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:06,750
We're from the organized crime unit.

749
01:03:06,850 --> 01:03:09,746
We'd like to ask you
a couple of questions.

750
01:03:11,170 --> 01:03:14,734
Would you mind explaining to us how you
ended up in the trunk of Vinny Gallino's car?

751
01:03:16,476 --> 01:03:19,747
Yeah, Vinny Gallino.
He works for Tony Forte.

752
01:03:19,847 --> 01:03:22,507
Did you owe him and his boss some money?

753
01:03:25,385 --> 01:03:27,922
Come on, you know who we're talking about.

754
01:03:28,022 --> 01:03:30,557
Tony Forte, aka "Tough Tony".

755
01:03:30,657 --> 01:03:33,084
Did you owe them money?

756
01:03:37,998 --> 01:03:41,902
Come on, Frank.
Don't play dumb shit with us, alright?

757
01:03:42,302 --> 01:03:44,972
We're not rookies,
we've been around a long time.

758
01:03:45,072 --> 01:03:48,607
You obviously must have done
something to piss them off.

759
01:03:50,177 --> 01:03:54,369
What was it? Did you get caught
skimming off the top, or what?

760
01:04:03,224 --> 01:04:05,785
You mind telling us what's so funny?

761
01:04:11,666 --> 01:04:13,859
This guy's bananas.

762
01:04:19,807 --> 01:04:22,243
<i>Paging Dr. Statement,
Dr. Statement please.</i>

763
01:04:22,343 --> 01:04:24,245
So he's not crazy?

764
01:04:24,345 --> 01:04:27,849
Well, his head has no structural damage.

765
01:04:27,949 --> 01:04:32,088
But it's hard to say at this point
without doing any further tests.

766
01:04:32,188 --> 01:04:35,225
You think maybe you're trying
to put one over on us?

767
01:04:36,125 --> 01:04:38,528
I don't think so.

768
01:04:38,828 --> 01:04:41,263
Unbelievable.
The one guy we find and he's nuts.

769
01:04:41,363 --> 01:04:44,033
Anything he says is not gonna
hold up in court. You know that?

770
01:04:44,133 --> 01:04:47,536
Yeah. But I'm not buying it.

771
01:04:47,636 --> 01:04:49,663
Thanks, doc.

772
01:04:53,242 --> 01:04:57,279
You know, I came into this world
full of piss and vinegar.

773
01:04:57,379 --> 01:05:00,216
You know, I started making
my bones by running numbers

774
01:05:00,316 --> 01:05:03,285
for Hunchback Charlie
and the 9th Avenue boys?

775
01:05:03,385 --> 01:05:06,488
And I was still in junior
high school when I did that.

776
01:05:06,588 --> 01:05:10,226
I ran porn theater,
strip clubs, I had a stable,

777
01:05:10,326 --> 01:05:12,796
20 girls working for me.

778
01:05:12,896 --> 01:05:15,132
I started putting some money
out into the street,

779
01:05:15,232 --> 01:05:18,293
charging a vague that no one
could compete with.

780
01:05:20,670 --> 01:05:25,053
I made a lot of money for those fellas.
I made some serious scratch.

781
01:05:25,153 --> 01:05:27,369
You know, but then...

782
01:05:28,545 --> 01:05:30,705
The Babania...

783
01:05:30,805 --> 01:05:33,525
shooting up 4 times a day.

784
01:05:33,850 --> 01:05:36,354
Lost everything I had.

785
01:05:37,254 --> 01:05:41,358
Wound up doing 10 years
in jail for armed robbery.

786
01:05:41,458 --> 01:05:43,527
Ten years.

787
01:05:43,627 --> 01:05:46,164
You know, when I got out, I was clean.

788
01:05:46,264 --> 01:05:48,933
And I wanted to get back
into the business, you know?

789
01:05:49,033 --> 01:05:50,815
So I had a...

790
01:05:50,915 --> 01:05:54,505
an uncle vouch for me.

791
01:05:54,605 --> 01:05:57,400
And I went back into action.

792
01:05:58,209 --> 01:06:01,959
And, now, it's taken me 30 years,

793
01:06:02,059 --> 01:06:06,450
30 years to get my reputation
back and I'll be damned...

794
01:06:06,550 --> 01:06:11,389
if I let some muck like
Frank Stone bring me down.

795
01:06:11,489 --> 01:06:13,891
Now I want that son
of a bitch taken care of.

796
01:06:13,991 --> 01:06:18,355
I want him put on ice.
And I want that done, now.

797
01:06:20,564 --> 01:06:24,688
Hate to be the one who told you so,
Tony, but I told you so.

798
01:06:42,521 --> 01:06:45,257
<i>Dr. Forest, dial 118, please.</i>

799
01:06:45,357 --> 01:06:49,286
<i>Dr. Forest, please dial 1-1-8.</i>

800
01:07:14,837 --> 01:07:17,908
<i>No matter where you roam</i>

801
01:07:27,967 --> 01:07:31,971
<i>They call it the blues</i>

802
01:07:40,081 --> 01:07:42,749
I have to sit next to you now.

803
01:07:42,949 --> 01:07:45,352
I gotta sit next to you!

804
01:07:45,652 --> 01:07:49,523
What's so funny, man?
What's so goddamn funny?

805
01:07:49,623 --> 01:07:53,352
Come on, white boy,
share with me the joke.

806
01:07:54,528 --> 01:08:00,467
See, last week this time,
I had a job, I had a car.

807
01:08:00,567 --> 01:08:02,703
I had a woman.

808
01:08:02,803 --> 01:08:07,609
A woman! I had a woman, white boy.

809
01:08:08,209 --> 01:08:11,645
I was making good money, Arizona.

810
01:08:11,745 --> 01:08:16,651
The place to be to work
for the right to make a living.

811
01:08:16,951 --> 01:08:20,322
I used to play in the band,
a band like rock 'n' roll.

812
01:08:20,422 --> 01:08:25,360
Stupid camisoles in the 80's,
that's where I met my girl.

813
01:08:25,860 --> 01:08:27,921
Well, my ex girl.

814
01:08:28,896 --> 01:08:31,357
She left me, white boy.

815
01:08:31,966 --> 01:08:33,868
She left me for...

816
01:08:33,968 --> 01:08:36,004
You're laughing!

817
01:08:36,104 --> 01:08:39,791
She left me for a short order cook...

818
01:08:39,891 --> 01:08:43,275
and goddamn Mexican!

819
01:08:46,181 --> 01:08:49,309
A goddamn Mexican!

820
01:08:51,153 --> 01:08:54,757
Dude... dude, that's just wrong, man.

821
01:08:54,857 --> 01:09:00,096
- My life sucks, white boy.
- What's your name, brother?

822
01:09:00,596 --> 01:09:02,523
John.

823
01:09:05,033 --> 01:09:08,871
But you can call me Cricket.
Everybody calls me Cricket.

824
01:09:08,971 --> 01:09:11,207
Cricket, Cricket, Cricket, like a cricket.

825
01:09:11,307 --> 01:09:13,109
- Cricket.
- That jumps around.

826
01:09:13,209 --> 01:09:17,012
- I jump around like a cricket.
- Oh, Cricket, baby.

827
01:09:17,112 --> 01:09:20,750
I love you, white boy,
you're the best, man.

828
01:09:21,250 --> 01:09:23,525
- I have a tattoo.
- Yeah?

829
01:09:23,625 --> 01:09:26,707
Tattoo of a cricket. Look, look, look.

830
01:09:26,807 --> 01:09:29,749
- Look at that!
- It's a cricket.

831
01:09:30,025 --> 01:09:32,028
Listen, you know, brother?

832
01:09:32,128 --> 01:09:35,399
I really appreciate you
opening up to me like this, brother.

833
01:09:35,499 --> 01:09:37,734
I mean, really, I do, you know?

834
01:09:37,834 --> 01:09:39,936
- I mean, from the heart.
- The heart?

835
01:09:40,036 --> 01:09:43,340
You know what I'm saying?
From the heart, brother.

836
01:09:44,441 --> 01:09:46,768
Holy shit, man!

837
01:09:47,311 --> 01:09:48,812
Oh, man!

838
01:09:48,912 --> 01:09:51,848
Dammit! Goddammit!

839
01:09:56,152 --> 01:09:59,038
Alright, guys,
finish your drink and get out.

840
01:09:59,138 --> 01:10:00,857
Wait a minute.

841
01:10:00,957 --> 01:10:03,827
Wait, you throwing me out of here
for laughing? Is that...

842
01:10:03,927 --> 01:10:06,496
I mean, what is wrong with this place?

843
01:10:06,596 --> 01:10:09,366
Hey! This place sucks!

844
01:10:09,466 --> 01:10:13,504
Hit the door, pal.
I want you out of here, now.

845
01:10:13,604 --> 01:10:17,633
Alright, alright, alright.
Look, no hard feelings.

846
01:10:19,910 --> 01:10:22,213
Alright, I'm going, okay?

847
01:10:22,313 --> 01:10:26,216
I'm going. Hey, what's that on your nose?

848
01:10:29,154 --> 01:10:31,380
Crazy, man!

849
01:10:31,956 --> 01:10:34,392
- Goddammit!
- Hey, Cricket.

850
01:10:34,492 --> 01:10:36,819
Goddammit, man!

851
01:10:39,697 --> 01:10:41,499
Hi.

852
01:10:42,433 --> 01:10:44,034
Hello?

853
01:10:44,134 --> 01:10:47,810
Hey, listen, I've had a hell of a day.
I just broke out of a hospital.

854
01:10:48,907 --> 01:10:51,588
What the hell you laughing at, it's true!

855
01:10:52,461 --> 01:10:55,597
These fuckin' guys tried to kill me.

856
01:10:56,047 --> 01:10:58,184
They did! They took guns,
they were shooting at me,

857
01:10:58,284 --> 01:11:01,812
they shot up the place,
they shot up my pillow.

858
01:11:03,389 --> 01:11:07,284
Well, I needed something to wear,
so I borrowed these.

859
01:11:08,494 --> 01:11:12,656
The guy next to me was dying of TB,
I figured he didn't need 'em.

860
01:11:13,565 --> 01:11:16,134
You're kind of a fun audience.

861
01:11:16,234 --> 01:11:18,330
You, you, I love you.

862
01:11:18,430 --> 01:11:20,722
Oh, my God, you!

863
01:11:26,946 --> 01:11:30,116
I had eight dollars stashed in my socks.

864
01:11:30,216 --> 01:11:32,852
And I dug it out and stuck it in my pocket

865
01:11:32,952 --> 01:11:36,656
as I walked up Broadway
towards 137 Street.

866
01:11:36,756 --> 01:11:40,226
I saw Flockle standing in front
of the subway entrance.

867
01:11:40,326 --> 01:11:43,188
"What's happening", I said. Not much.

868
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:03,542
Yo, what are you doing?

869
01:12:05,419 --> 01:12:07,312
No!

870
01:12:07,688 --> 01:12:09,425
No!

871
01:12:10,223 --> 01:12:12,517
What are you doing?

872
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:35,816
<i>Dear Jackie, it's your friend, Frank.</i>

873
01:12:35,916 --> 01:12:40,579
<i>I've been meaning to call you for some
time now, but thought this note would do.</i>

874
01:12:43,725 --> 01:12:46,595
<i>Something happened that changed my life.</i>

875
01:12:46,695 --> 01:12:51,343
<i>I'm still not sure what exactly,
but all I know is that I'm happy.</i>

876
01:12:51,443 --> 01:12:54,536
<i>Truly happy for the first time.</i>

877
01:12:54,636 --> 01:12:56,971
<i>And I want you to be happy.</i>

878
01:12:57,071 --> 01:13:01,090
<i>So I suggest we see your daughter
together as originally planned</i>

879
01:13:01,190 --> 01:13:03,912
<i>so you can tell her that you love her.</i>

880
01:13:04,012 --> 01:13:06,715
<i>Meet me at the coffee shop
tomorrow at three o'clock.</i>

881
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:08,850
<i>And we'll leave together.</i>

882
01:13:08,950 --> 01:13:11,820
<i>I can't wait to look
at your inspiring presence</i>

883
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:14,689
<i>and your beautiful face once again.</i>

884
01:13:14,789 --> 01:13:18,995
<i>Thank you very, very much for taking
the time to understand me.</i>

885
01:13:19,895 --> 01:13:22,990
<i>Your friend, always, Frank.</i>

886
01:13:30,172 --> 01:13:31,674
Frank?

887
01:13:31,774 --> 01:13:34,076
How the hell did you get in here?

888
01:13:34,176 --> 01:13:38,773
That letter you wrote me
was so beautiful, I cried like a baby.

889
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:41,942
Like a baby, huh?

890
01:13:43,118 --> 01:13:45,145
Look at me.

891
01:13:49,191 --> 01:13:51,494
I want to ask you one question.
One question.

892
01:13:51,594 --> 01:13:55,756
If I don't like the answer,
we're gonna bash your face in.

893
01:13:58,502 --> 01:14:02,063
Frank take you to Coney Island, huh?

894
01:14:03,039 --> 01:14:05,509
Did he do this to you, huh?

895
01:14:06,009 --> 01:14:08,303
Did he do this to you?

896
01:14:08,945 --> 01:14:11,582
I'm gonna ask you one question.

897
01:14:12,182 --> 01:14:14,542
Where is Frank Stone?

898
01:14:17,554 --> 01:14:20,624
- I swear I don't know.
- Answer him.

899
01:14:21,024 --> 01:14:23,167
One more time...

900
01:14:23,267 --> 01:14:25,860
where is Frank Stone?

901
01:14:27,030 --> 01:14:29,891
I swear I don't know!

902
01:14:33,870 --> 01:14:36,441
Where is Frank Stone?

903
01:14:36,541 --> 01:14:38,676
I swear I don't know.

904
01:14:38,776 --> 01:14:41,804
I'd tell you if I did, I swear,
but I don't know.

905
01:14:46,584 --> 01:14:48,810
Finish her off.

906
01:15:16,481 --> 01:15:19,535
Oh, if it isn't Cocky and Snowwinkle?

907
01:15:19,635 --> 01:15:20,986
What's up, Frank?

908
01:15:21,086 --> 01:15:24,623
Paper time's over, pajama boy.
Enough of the clown routine.

909
01:15:25,223 --> 01:15:27,526
Catch any bad guys lately, coppers?

910
01:15:27,626 --> 01:15:32,198
Cut the bullshit, Frank, alright?
We want you to testify against Tough Tony.

911
01:15:32,598 --> 01:15:36,267
I don't wanna, you know?
I'm having so much fun,

912
01:15:36,367 --> 01:15:38,904
just hanging out and being happy.

913
01:15:39,104 --> 01:15:41,740
Why are you protecting this piece
of garbage? He tried to have you killed.

914
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:46,036
So did my mother, but I don't
hold that against her, huh?

915
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:50,115
Yeah, well, I can understand
why your mother hated you.

916
01:15:50,215 --> 01:15:52,822
I know you 5 seconds
and I can't stand you.

917
01:15:53,052 --> 01:15:57,557
Detective, you should really try
a more refreshing breath mint.

918
01:15:59,057 --> 01:16:02,662
You think you're crazy, huh, Frank?
Look at that.

919
01:16:02,762 --> 01:16:05,231
But I'm the one who's crazy around here.

920
01:16:05,331 --> 01:16:09,435
I'm from east New York. Brooklyn, kid.
We used to throw people off rooftops.

921
01:16:09,535 --> 01:16:14,173
Stick up gangsters. Rob drug dealers,
then we'd sell it back to them.

922
01:16:14,623 --> 01:16:18,086
So don't sit here and think
you're the only one that's crazy.

923
01:16:19,545 --> 01:16:21,548
Let me tell you something.

924
01:16:21,648 --> 01:16:25,543
If I didn't have this badge,
I'd forget that I'm a cop.

925
01:16:28,288 --> 01:16:30,557
I'd really listen to that, Frank.

926
01:16:30,657 --> 01:16:33,419
What are you gonna do?
You gonna throw me off a rooftop?

927
01:16:42,570 --> 01:16:44,829
Then keep laughing.

928
01:16:46,073 --> 01:16:49,101
Aren't you supposed to meet
that girl that you like?

929
01:16:50,678 --> 01:16:52,771
Jackie, right?

930
01:16:54,849 --> 01:16:58,410
I got something for you.
You're gonna like this.

931
01:17:03,357 --> 01:17:05,480
She's waiting for you at this address.

932
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:07,921
Now that's funny.

933
01:17:14,736 --> 01:17:16,463
Is Jackie Mott here?

934
01:17:23,011 --> 01:17:25,070
Oh, no.

935
01:18:15,697 --> 01:18:16,966
Where'd you take us?

936
01:18:17,066 --> 01:18:20,169
I told you, this is the best rub
and tub joint in the city, bar none.

937
01:18:20,269 --> 01:18:22,371
- See, this is what I'm talking about.
- She's nice.

938
01:18:22,471 --> 01:18:26,309
- Hello. Follow me, please.
- Sure, anywhere.

939
01:19:42,687 --> 01:19:45,182
Come on, I want to win tonight.

940
01:22:04,499 --> 01:22:06,569
Yeah, it's me.

941
01:22:06,669 --> 01:22:09,672
I have a problem that needs fixing.

942
01:22:11,174 --> 01:22:14,878
I found this rat in my kitchen

943
01:22:14,978 --> 01:22:17,831
and it needs to be
exterminated right away.

944
01:22:20,950 --> 01:22:25,559
I want you to get the best exterminator
that money can buy, that's what I want.

945
01:22:29,658 --> 01:22:31,681
He's the best?

946
01:22:33,396 --> 01:22:35,673
Alright, set up a meeting.

947
01:22:57,154 --> 01:22:59,682
Now I want to hire you...

948
01:22:59,782 --> 01:23:03,427
'cause word got around to me
that you're the best.

949
01:23:03,527 --> 01:23:05,529
I know what people call you by reputation.

950
01:23:05,629 --> 01:23:09,524
What should I call you?
What do you call yourself?

951
01:23:20,577 --> 01:23:22,071
Lucifer.

952
01:23:23,380 --> 01:23:25,240
Lucifer.

953
01:23:26,017 --> 01:23:29,420
I'm gonna give you a chance
to live up to that name.

954
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:33,380
Because this isn't business...

955
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:36,205
this is personal.

956
01:23:36,361 --> 01:23:40,684
I want you to cause Frank Stone...

957
01:23:40,784 --> 01:23:46,437
more pain and suffering
than humanly possible.

958
01:23:46,537 --> 01:23:48,839
I want you to cause him
more pain and suffering

959
01:23:48,939 --> 01:23:52,535
than you ever caused anybody, ever.

960
01:23:55,180 --> 01:23:57,874
Do... do we understand each other?

961
01:24:20,206 --> 01:24:22,533
Frank, open up.

962
01:24:24,243 --> 01:24:26,737
We have a search warrant.

963
01:24:29,381 --> 01:24:31,317
Frank, open up.

964
01:24:31,417 --> 01:24:33,644
You think he's in there?

965
01:24:37,223 --> 01:24:40,621
Come on, Frank,
or we're gonna bust down the door.

966
01:24:42,795 --> 01:24:45,089
Frank, open up.

967
01:27:12,549 --> 01:27:13,709
Well?

968
01:27:16,537 --> 01:27:18,730
Did you get him?

969
01:27:20,557 --> 01:27:23,084
I asked you a question.

970
01:27:29,049 --> 01:27:33,007
Did you kill him?
Did you kill Frank Stone?

971
01:27:36,340 --> 01:27:38,267
What's the matter with you?

972
01:27:53,658 --> 01:27:55,718
Bye, Dad.

973
01:27:58,730 --> 01:28:01,090
You're Sarah, right?

974
01:28:01,999 --> 01:28:03,968
My name is Frank.

975
01:28:04,068 --> 01:28:06,463
I was a friend of your mom's.

976
01:28:07,405 --> 01:28:10,362
She wanted me to tell you something.

977
01:28:12,043 --> 01:28:15,347
She wanted me to tell you
that she loved ya.

978
01:28:15,447 --> 01:28:18,408
That she always loved you.

979
01:28:58,023 --> 01:29:00,417
How you doin', Tony?

980
01:29:02,327 --> 01:29:04,154
Alright.

981
01:29:04,563 --> 01:29:06,833
Alright, Frank.

982
01:29:06,933 --> 01:29:08,335
You got me.

983
01:29:08,435 --> 01:29:12,338
So just do what you got to do.
Alright, I just made peace with my maker.

984
01:29:12,438 --> 01:29:15,074
I don't care about dying.
Go ahead, do what you got to do.

985
01:29:15,174 --> 01:29:17,903
Do you really think a one minute prayer...

986
01:29:18,003 --> 01:29:20,914
is going to straighten things out
with the big guy upstairs, Tony?

987
01:29:21,014 --> 01:29:25,785
Yeah, I do. He knows
what I did was out of necessity.

988
01:29:25,885 --> 01:29:27,745
Necessity?

989
01:29:31,891 --> 01:29:33,684
Frank!

990
01:29:36,630 --> 01:29:38,832
You feel it, Tony?

991
01:29:38,932 --> 01:29:43,284
That's the feeling of pain and agony
that you cause people out of necessity.

992
01:29:43,854 --> 01:29:46,106
I'm an avenging angel, Tony.

993
01:29:46,206 --> 01:29:49,034
This time you hurt the wrong person.

994
01:30:04,723 --> 01:30:08,666
Yeah, I feel better.
I used to be a bit of a partier.

995
01:30:08,766 --> 01:30:11,066
I used to drink too much.
A lot of people say to me

996
01:30:11,166 --> 01:30:14,669
"Art, what's a wild night of drinking to you?
You look like you've had a few." And I have.

997
01:30:14,769 --> 01:30:18,539
A wild night of drinking to me is when you
drink too much and eventually you pass out.

998
01:30:18,639 --> 01:30:21,810
And when you wake up, you're naked
in a police car with two cops.

999
01:30:21,910 --> 01:30:25,005
But the weird part is, you're driving.

1000
01:30:26,147 --> 01:30:27,916
That'll be a wild night of drinking!

1001
01:30:28,016 --> 01:30:30,985
Not for you, man.
That's like a Tuesday night for you.

1002
01:30:32,020 --> 01:30:34,690
I did a lot of drugs, as well.

1003
01:30:34,890 --> 01:30:38,293
The reason I did drugs was, I think, the
anti-drug slogans when I was a kid were bad.

1004
01:30:38,393 --> 01:30:41,930
Like, remember "hugs are better
than drugs". That didn't work for me.

1005
01:30:42,030 --> 01:30:44,265
My mother used to scream
that at me as I left the house.

1006
01:30:44,365 --> 01:30:47,068
"Remember, hugs are better than drugs."
And I believed her.

1007
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:50,972
I believed everything my mother said
until the first time I got high at a party.

1008
01:30:51,072 --> 01:30:53,074
I leaned back and I was like "wow."

1009
01:30:53,174 --> 01:30:56,412
"This is way better
than when my mother hugs me."

1010
01:30:56,512 --> 01:30:59,049
"What else has she been
lying to me about?"

1011
01:30:59,149 --> 01:31:02,285
Do I not have great bone structure?

1012
01:31:02,885 --> 01:31:06,289
Am I not the best looking boy
in New Jersey?

1013
01:31:06,589 --> 01:31:08,324
Hugs are great, but better than drugs?

1014
01:31:08,424 --> 01:31:11,961
Come on, let's not lie to the kids.
Let me put it to you this way.

1015
01:31:12,061 --> 01:31:15,899
I never drove to Harlem at 4 am
to get somebody to hug me.

1016
01:31:17,099 --> 01:31:20,993
Hey, Carlos, here's 20 bucks,
just put your arms around me.

1017
01:31:22,539 --> 01:31:24,240
I grew up with a domineering mother.

1018
01:31:24,340 --> 01:31:26,876
She would say stuff at the top of her lungs,
screaming at me.

1019
01:31:26,976 --> 01:31:29,846
Some bad, some good, it was confusing.
I didn't know what to do.

1020
01:31:29,946 --> 01:31:33,049
She would say stuff like "I hate you!"
"I never want to see you again."

1021
01:31:33,149 --> 01:31:35,452
"Are you hungry?"

1022
01:31:35,552 --> 01:31:37,621
"Get out of this house
and never come back."

1023
01:31:37,721 --> 01:31:40,858
"There are chicken goblets
in the refrigerator."

1024
01:31:40,958 --> 01:31:44,194
And since then, I gained some weight.
I'm not gonna lie, I've had weight issues.

1025
01:31:44,294 --> 01:31:47,498
I try to lose weight. Someone said "You wanna
lose weight?" "You should go swimming."

1026
01:31:47,598 --> 01:31:49,667
I've never been swimming
before in my life.

1027
01:31:49,767 --> 01:31:53,558
And that's because it has never been more
than a half an hour since I last ate.

1028
01:31:54,004 --> 01:31:56,367
You know what I'm talking about?

1029
01:32:15,994 --> 01:32:17,962
<i>Any questions?</i>

1030
01:32:18,062 --> 01:32:19,855
<i>No?</i>

1031
01:32:19,964 --> 01:32:22,659
<i>Alright then, well, let's move on.</i>

1032
01:32:24,603 --> 01:32:28,740
<i>From nothingness came I,
and it is where I shall go.</i>

1033
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:32,043
<i>Well, at least that's
what I used to think.</i>

1034
01:32:32,143 --> 01:32:35,016
<i>During those lonely days
and sleepless nights,</i>

1035
01:32:35,116 --> 01:32:38,216
<i>to pacify my soul,
I would say these words.</i>

1036
01:32:38,316 --> 01:32:41,452
<i>They made me, somehow,
understand my existence</i>

1037
01:32:41,552 --> 01:32:44,289
<i>until I had to live
another day of coldness.</i>

1038
01:32:44,989 --> 01:32:47,926
<i>And I lived those days and wept.</i>

1039
01:32:48,026 --> 01:32:51,295
<i>Like all men who contemplate their agony.</i>

1040
01:32:51,395 --> 01:32:54,566
<i>Then, like a ray of sun
peaking through the clouds,</i>

1041
01:32:54,666 --> 01:32:56,946
<i>you came shining on to me.</i>

1042
01:32:57,169 --> 01:33:00,840
<i>With a radiance only the birds
of paradise could understand.</i>

1043
01:33:00,940 --> 01:33:03,475
<i>Bringing forth wisdom and beauty,</i>

1044
01:33:03,575 --> 01:33:06,145
<i>compassion and understanding.</i>

1045
01:33:06,245 --> 01:33:07,352
<i>Mercy.</i>

1046
01:33:09,949 --> 01:33:12,417
<i>Then, without warning,
you left this world.</i>

1047
01:33:12,517 --> 01:33:16,442
<i>But not without teaching me
who I am and what I should be.</i>

1048
01:33:16,542 --> 01:33:18,391
<i>And where I should go.</i>

1049
01:33:18,591 --> 01:33:21,835
<i>And it is that
which I am most grateful for.</i>

1050
01:33:21,935 --> 01:33:25,054
<i>That you taught me to see the light.</i>

1051
01:33:32,038 --> 01:33:35,032
Have a good night, Tony,
I'll see you tomorrow.

1052
01:34:00,734 --> 01:34:02,468
Hey, Tony?

1053
01:34:02,568 --> 01:34:04,830
I changed my mind.

1054
01:34:26,093 --> 01:34:28,963
I'm a person who knew Frank Stone, okay?

1055
01:34:29,063 --> 01:34:31,566
When he was a little, little boy.

1056
01:34:32,166 --> 01:34:35,703
Before he had a chance
to turn his rage on the world.

1057
01:34:36,403 --> 01:34:38,263
Okay?

1058
01:34:40,975 --> 01:34:43,001
Who are you?

1059
01:34:43,444 --> 01:34:46,839
And if you know, you'd be
the first person I ever met that did.

1060
01:34:49,684 --> 01:34:51,544
Okay?

1061
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:54,815
I got nothing else to say to you.

1062
01:34:56,558 --> 01:35:00,663
Now many men don't mean this
when they say it, but I do.

1063
01:35:00,763 --> 01:35:04,132
If you don't leave here right now,
I'm gonna kill you.

1064
01:35:04,232 --> 01:35:06,178
Okay?
