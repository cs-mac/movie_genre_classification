2
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,660
Scalpel.

3
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,720
6 milimeters of epinephrine!

4
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,880
What are you doing Dcotor Jang?

5
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:51,310
Uou always say you're condifent.

6
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:53,530
But don't you think I know the alternate procedure!

7
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:56,830
You don't think I'm your kind,so let's do it in my way.

8
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:57,850
Are you pulling my leg?

9
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,150
He did humilliate himself.

10
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:04,610
Should I transfer him out,if things get out of hand to appease you?

11
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:06,610
Do you have someone in mind?

12
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:08,330
Is this really necessary?

13
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:10,410
You're already a renowned surgeon.

14
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:12,650
I don't understand why you're so consumed to get that position.

15
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:16,940
We have a different perspective in life.

16
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,790
I can't believe you.

17
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:25,340
-Can you hear me, out? I told you to let go.

18
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,570
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,020
Sorry I was imprudent.Please forgive me.

20
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:42,560
Hello, Dr. Lee.

21
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:47,720
Dr. Jang come to see me.

22
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,660
He volunteered go to our branch hospital.

23
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,320
I know we can't send him for our hospital's sake, but he insists.

24
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:03,460
If he made that decision I believe we should respect it.

25
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:08,400
I see. I guess we should do that.

26
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,200
I know it was a difficult decision.Thanks for volunteering.

27
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,290
Please set up the branch hospital for us.

28

<i>Episode 3</i>

29
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,460
Chief, it's time to make your rounds.

30
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,080
Okay, let's go.

31
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,600
Did something good happen to you?

32
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,250
No, it's nothing.

33
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,420
How are things with you, Dr. Hong?

34
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,980
What are you talking about?

35
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:28,920
Although I haven't expressed my thoughts, I know you're working hard.

36
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,100
You're too kind. I have much to learn.

37
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,250
I haven't taught you much.

38
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:40,890
You taught us through your actions. We have much to learn from you.

39
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:45,560
Thank you for your consideration. I should take better of you.

40
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:50,670
You'll receive plenty of opportunities by being patient and working hard.

41
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:53,210
Thank you. I'll do my best, Chief.

42
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:55,800
- Let's make our rounds.
- Yes, Sir.

43
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:22,230
- What happened?
- It just happened.

44
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:27,060
Why didn't you discuss an important matter like that to me?

45
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,660
I'm sorry.

46
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:32,300
Weren't you adamant about not going?

47
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,370
Why aren't you saying anything?

48
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:42,740
All I can say is that I'm sorry.

49
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:35,070
He's definitely worth being assistant director.

50
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:39,740
It's not funny, father. If we don't do anything, my career is over!

51
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:44,310
You're not as smart as I thought you were.

52
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:48,370
Then why did you operate on the assistant director's patient?

53
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:53,070
I did because her case was rare.

54
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:56,490
That's why I like you.

55
00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:04,150
You need that kind of passion to become chief of surgery.

56
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:08,590
I'll take care of it, so don't worry.

57
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:13,980
I can get you out of this mess in no time.

58
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:17,090
What is it, Father?

59
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,590
There's a way.

60
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:29,850
Let's just say, it'll be a good opportunity to test our friendship.

61
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:36,160
Let's have dinner tonight. You'll find out about them.

62
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:43,290
Anyhow, how much did you pay for the painting?

63
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:50,330
It was originally $30,000, but I got a 10% discount.

64
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:59,520
Woo Yong Kil, painting is $27,000.

65
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:05,160
It's a nice painting, but oh well...

66
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,460
Can't you just accept it?

67
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:11,690
I don't think it's right.

68
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:17,960
As you know, he doesn't like to hear he receives bribes.

69
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,780
That wasn't our intention, it was just a small gift.

70
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:29,800
Tell me about it. He needs to be more flexible.

71
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:36,610
But he's so conservative, it's hard on me sometimes.

72
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:40,270
I'll temporarily hold onto it.

73
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:44,430
Tell me when he's no longer upset.

74
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,270
Okay, I will.

75
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:51,060
What did Dr. Jang do to upset my husband?

76
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:56,380
It just makes our relationship uneasy. You should give him a hard time about it!

77
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,510
I will!

78
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:01,180
Why did Dr. Jang make such a sudden change of decision?

79
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:04,020
I don't know since he didn't tell me.

80
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:07,580
I thought something happened between you two.

81
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:11,470
Pardon? Nothing happened between us.

82
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,850
- I'm only kidding.
- I see.

83
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:18,570
He volunteered on his own accord.

84
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:22,510
However, I'm just a bit concerned.

85
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:28,080
I don't want people to make assumptions that I coerced him.

86
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,980
You were worried about that. I'll alleviate that for you.

87
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:36,120
I'll explain to the other board of directors.

88
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,660
I would appreciate that.

89
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:47,760
- The patient is recovering well.
- That's good.

90
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,100
Can I move to a regular room?

91
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:55,340
I'm bored, and I feel like I'm burdening everyone.

92
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:58,240
Let's stay for one more day.

93
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,260
Thank you for taking good care of her.

94
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,490
Let's all have dinner today.

95
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,490
I think it's better to have dinner after next week's seminar.

96
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:11,530
Okay.

97
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:16,020
Let's just have dinner today.

98
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,140
Yes, Sir.

99
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:24,180
If you're butting heads with someone powerful, just find someone stronger.

100
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:28,000
There's no absolute authority. Everyone has a nemesis.

101
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,350
- Yes, nemesis.
- Hello.

102
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:33,320
I told you not to wear your hospital gown!

103
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:44,090
- Dr. Yoo!
- Dr. Min!

104
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:45,620
You should've waited for me inside.

105
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:49,220
I wanted to finish listening to this.

106
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:52,550
Come here. Let's go in.

107
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,070
Is everyone here?

108
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:00,550
Everyone's here except for the people in surgery and on duty.

109
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:03,190
Dr. Jang isn't here for personal reasons.

110
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:07,400
He'll be busy because he'll be transfering to our branch hospital.

111
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,910
Let's have a drink.

112
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:22,690
I want to clarify that this is just a temporary transfer.

113
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:29,930
Dr. Jang will return once I retire.

114
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,620
Yes.

115
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:35,410
Be sure there aren't any problems with the transition.

116
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:36,980
Yes.

117
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:09,840
- Where did you hike today?
- Mt. Bukhan.

118
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:13,990
I walked along the mountain ridges.

119
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:16,240
It almost took me 10 hours to complete.

120
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,410
- Do I stink?
- Not really.

121
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,900
You're so amazing.

122
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:26,160
I'm planning on going to Himalaya next year.

123
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,800
Wow.

124
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,650
Oh, this is my son-in-law.

125
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:34,130
Say hello to the chair of the medical association.

126
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:37,830
He's also the President of the Myongin University Medical Alumni Association.

127
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,910
My name is Jang Joon Hyuk.

128
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:43,580
I heard much about you.

129
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:49,200
We're drinking until we're drunk, okay?

130
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,470
I have a higher tolerance now that I hike.

131
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:54,360
You can't leave me hanging, okay?

132
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,350
Oh no, we're dead.

133
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,180
It's Yongkil.

134
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:08,280
Isn't he the assistant director at your hospital?

135
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,260
Hi Yongkil!

136
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:14,570
I didn't have any reception in the mountain.

137
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:16,140
What's up?

138
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,360
What? Really?

139
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:23,840
If you keep this up, I'm not going to help you from now on.

140
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:31,220
Of course, you need to be good to me.

141
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,260
Tomorrow?

142
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:36,680
I'm meeting someone from the Public Health Association.

143
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:40,080
He should've said something after he took the shot.

144
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:44,100
I can't distinguish if we drank or not.

145
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:50,310
Although temporary, isn't it odd to transfer Dr. Jang?

146
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:53,570
It's definitely strange.

147
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:57,610
Does that mean all we have to do is brown-nose him?

148
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,780
What do you mean? He's retiring soon.

149
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:07,550
That's right. Then I'll have to brown-nose you.

150
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,970
Be careful of what you say.

151
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:13,510
You scared me. You should've made some noise.

152
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:16,960
It's only a joke.

153
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:23,150
- Dr Jang.
- Yes, Sir.

154
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:27,750
Keep this in mind. We're at war now.

155
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,750
- Yes, Sir.
- I'll support you.

156
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:34,140
You have to keep your head on straight.

157
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,640
I'll keep that in mind.

158
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:42,270
I'm grateful to know you. Don't you agree?

159
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,540
Here you go. Bottoms up. And I want to hear you sing.

160
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,080
Sorry?

161
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:59,590
Yeah, sing a song for us.

162
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,730
Yes.

163
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,550
Nice.

164
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:32,540
He's a really good singer.

165
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:36,090
Where did you learn how to sing?

166
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:38,450
- Thank you.
- Hang on.

167
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:47,030
You should have this.

168
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:49,250
I'm giving you because you sang well.

169
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:52,160
- Take it.
- Dr. Yoo...

170
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,520
My hands are going to fall off.

171
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,770
Yes... thank you.

172
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:00,860
This is expensive. Hold on to it well.

173
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,540
You should put it on.

174
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,730
Don't worry.

175
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:11,890
I'm the only one that can push Yongkil around.

176
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:15,230
- Got that?
- Of course.

177
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,270
Who's going to take me home?

178
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:21,150
My car's right here. Let's go.

179
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,420
Goodbye, Sir

180
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:25,360
Bye.

181
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,230
Bye.

182
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,900
What's up?

183
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,050
The light was on.

184
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:23,040
Did you have a drink?

185
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:31,190
Why is life so tough?

186
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,860
It's because you're spreading yourself thin.

187
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:41,330
If you focus on being a doctor, it won't be as tough.

188
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:46,340
- I can't live like that.
- Life will be tougher for you.

189
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,720
I think I'm bothering you.

190
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:47,060
Try to sleep. You'll feel much better.

191
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,600
Honey, where are you?

192
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,740
Are you back? How was the surgery?

193
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,910
Good. Wrap that painting up.

194
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:28,990
- I'm going to give it back.
- Really?

195
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:33,080
I'll wrap it up, but don't ask me to deliver it.

196
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:36,510
- Do you know how embarrassing it was?
- I'm sorry.

197
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:40,110
You should do better, so I can lift my head high.

198
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:46,090
- Okay, don't cringe. 
- It hurts.

199
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,470
What's this?

200
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:51,250
It's a long story.

201
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:54,550
What is it? Where did you get such a tacky watch?

202
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:55,990
Take it off this once.

203
00:19:55,990 --> 00:20:01,040
Even though it's tacky, my life depends on it.

204
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,650
Why weren't you at the dinner last night?

205
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:08,270
I had to take care of something.

206
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:11,240
We might not have time to throw you a farewell party.

207
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,850
It's okay, I'll be here often.

208
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:16,780
Is your wife accompanying you?

209
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:19,480
I haven't told her yet, so I'm not sure.

210
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,400
If you're going alone, you should stay at the staff residence.

211
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:28,360
All you have to do is pay $100 per month and come up every weekend.

212
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,630
Yes...

213
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:36,160
- Hi Dr. Yoo!
- What brings you here?

214
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,910
I came here because I missed you.

215
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:41,340
This is the Medical Association Chair, Dr. Yoo Pil Sang.

216
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:46,130
This is the chief of surgery Dr. Lee Joo Wan, and this is Dr. Jang Jun Hyuk.

217
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:49,910
Dr. Jang?

218
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:54,660
What an honor

219
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,160
to meet such a wonderful surgeon!

220
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,310
You're too kind.

221
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,470
Chief, haven't we met before?

222
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:08,620
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

223
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:13,530
Isn't Dr. Jang the next chief of surgery?

224
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:16,940
- No, I'm not.
- What do you mean?

225
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:21,470
The chief will support you, and so will the assistant director.

226
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:23,720
In addition, our alumni association will support you.

227
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,240
You're definitely the next successor.

228
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:28,540
- Don't you agree?
- Well...

229
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,180
What are you talking about?

230
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:37,040
We have to wait until we tally up the votes at the board of directors' meeting.

231
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,760
I know.

232
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:44,090
I'm just saying Dr. Jang should win fair and square.

233
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:46,170
If not, that's completely unfair!

234
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,460
Don't you agree?

235
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:52,020
Pardon? You're right.

236
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:55,100
Stop talking nonsense. Why did you come here?

237
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,390
See? I'm already booked.

238
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:01,540
Why would I come in person and ask you a difficult favor?

239
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,470
I already confirmed I'm going.

240
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:06,390
I already told them you're lecturing too.

241
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:09,610
Do you want me to cancel the pharmaceutical seminar for you?

242
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:13,360
It's okay, I'll do it myself.

243
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,640
You're my best friend.

244
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:26,390
Honestly, you're the best in geriatrics... You quack.

245
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:32,490
The Medical Association Chair seems pretentious.

246
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:35,580
He seems to be a humorous and nice man.

247
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:40,800
Don't be bothered. Everyone's different.

248
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:46,080
I'll prepare transitioning my role.

249
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:03,370
If Dr. Jang is eliminated, then who is the next chief of surgery?

250
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:07,440
Do you think we'll recruit someone?

251
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,690
- Hello.
- Hello.

252
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,360
How was my farewell party yesterday?

253
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,470
Sorry?

254
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:19,010
- Yesterday was just a dinner.
- Really?

255
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:21,490
I'm glad you had a good dinner.

256
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:25,520
- Can I talk to you, Gun Ha?
- Yes.

257
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:42,940
I can't believe my career of 20 years went down the drain like this.

258
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,990
It's completely unfair.

259
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:53,420
What's done is done, but I'm frustrated you might get hurt as well.

260
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:59,270
I was planning on promoting you to assistant professor...

261
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:02,180
I can't promise you anything now.

262
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,210
Dr. Jang!

263
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:11,040
I'll do my best with the other doctors to overturn the decision.

264
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:16,480
No, don't do that. What if something happens to you?

265
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,800
I'll be wise about it and take the lead.

266
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:26,670
What if something does happen to you?

267
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:30,370
That won't ever happen.

268
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:36,650
Then I'll put you in charge. Thank you.

269
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:38,420
Don't worry.

270
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:44,360
I don't know what the chief is up to, but justice will prevail.

271
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:52,540
I wonder who it is... He must be an alma matter of the chief.

272
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:56,140
Ah, that's what it was!

273
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,640
What?

274
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,890
A few days ago, I saw something that the chief printed out.

275
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:02,930
It was a resume.

276
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:06,620
As I look back, I think they were resumes of the candidates for the next chief.

277
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,260
What?

278
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,130
Who were they?

279
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:12,680
He took them away from me before I could take a look.

280
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,360
Really?

281
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:23,030
Why are you being stubborn?

282
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:27,490
Nurse, can you tell her for me?

283
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:28,700
You should listen to your mother.

284
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:32,720
You'll feel uncomfortable if you move to another room.

285
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,770
The nurses take really good care of me.

286
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:39,710
It's not like I'm recovering faster because you're here.

287
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:44,440
I won't nurse you, so just stay here.

288
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:48,400
- No, I don't want to.
- People will talk behind our backs!

289
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,330
Your father is the chief of surgery

290
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:56,520
How could you be so selfish?

291
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:00,830
I'm a patient. Shouldn't I do what I want?

292
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:03,570
Don't you agree?

293
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:12,600
I transferred them from pediatrics to the department of surgery.

294
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,450
Is it because of the surgery?

295
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:16,330
The chief of pediatrics tranferred me because

296
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:22,890
he said she could receive surgery as soon as the chemotherapy reduces the tumor.

297
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:26,990
I hope things go well this time.

298
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:29,840
Jin Joo, show me a magic trick.

299
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,420
Don't lose hope.

300
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,760
Just once... please?

301
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,360
Jin Joo's happy and optimistic.

302
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,690
A patient's perspective is very crucial when it comes to fighting off a disease.

303
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:43,550
Wow, that's so cool. You're so great.

304
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:49,040
- Dr. Choi!
- Hi, Yu Jin!

305
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,710
- Hello, Madame.
- Hi.

306
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:53,240
- I didn't know you're here.
- Yes.

307
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,080
She should be at the special room.

308
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,400
But she doesn't care about her father's reputation.

309
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,690
It's okay to be around other people. You made a good decision.

310
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:02,760
Thanks.

311
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:08,070
You'll have fun being next to a kid magician.

312
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:11,270
Jin Joo, say hi. This is Yu Jin.

313
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:14,930
Hi. Are you a magician?

314
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:19,070
- Can you show me?
- Are you nice?

315
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:22,340
What? Why?

316
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:26,220
She only shows her magic to nice people.

317
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:29,110
She's nice, show her.

318
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:33,460
- Wow.
- This is a regular rope.

319
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:36,440
Watch carefully.

320
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,810
- Wow!
- Wow, that's amazing!

321
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:47,740
That was wonderful!

322
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,480
I know Chairman Yoo Pil Sang very well.

323
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,470
He's a very close friend of the assistant director.

324
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:54,480
I didn't know he was so pretentious.

325
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,440
But without him, Dr. Woo couldn't have become the assistant director.

326
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,800
Is that so?

327
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:04,580
He's a very influential person in the medical world.

328
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:10,170
He used his influence to elect someone with all the votes.

329
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:15,200
I guess everyone has their special talents.

330
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,270
I have to go now.

331
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:21,220
Okay, I'll see you at the wine bar later.

332
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,720
Hello, chief Yoo.

333
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:31,580
- I brought you the budget for...
- I have to go to the restroom.

334
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:45,590
I'm already nervous.

335
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,190
I feel like you're going to tell me something that

336
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:49,230
you can't mention here at the hospital.

337
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,520
It's not a big deal.

338
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:55,080
I just wanted to buy you a drink out of gratitude.

339
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,190
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

340
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:23,050
Where are you going?

341
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:25,240
I'm going home to get some clothes.

342
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:28,970
Don't you know nursing isn't necessary at our hospital?

343
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:32,750
But I should. People are watching.

344
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:35,190
Don't push yourself too hard.

345
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:38,810
I don't know. I'll do it for one more day.

346
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:41,720
- Bye.
- Okay.

347
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:20,000
<i>Resume</i>

348
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:59,810
- What's going on?
- The door was locked.

349
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:02,480
- Did you lock it?
- Why would I?

350
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,870
That's strange.

351
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,950
This is the budget for Dr. Koh's 77th birthday reception.

352
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:13,340
What about the invitation?

353
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:16,780
I haven't gotten to that yet. i'll get that to you as soon as possible.

354
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:19,550
Goodbye.

355
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:20,390
<i>Dr. Roh Min Kook's resume</i>

356
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:31,020
Think of it as cultivating cancer cells

357
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:34,130
to find the appropriate chemotherapy for the patient.

358
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:40,300
Dr. Choi is an expert in cultivating cancer cells.

359
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:45,050
I'm sorry, but can you do another presentation for our board of directors?

360
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:48,710
Of course, anytime.

361
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:52,880
Can you tell the managers to come to the conference room?

362
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,480
Yes.

363
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:04,130
Come to think of it, you've been the chief of thoracic surgery for the past 6 years.

364
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:09,680
You helped me a lot. I am who I am, thank you.

365
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:13,630
Stop saying that. We're good friends.

366
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:16,000
But I'm telling the truth.

367
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,080
But sometimes I wonder

368
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:23,560
if the cooperation will be as strong when I leave.

369
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:29,030
I'm not too sure about Dr. Jang.

370
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:35,840
I understand. He may be a good doctor, but he's not humanistic.

371
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,540
That concerns me the most, now that I'm retiring.

372
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:43,120
You're a wonderful person to feel responsibility for that.

373
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,710
I want him to be the next successor

374
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:50,700
but for the sake of our hospital, my conscience won't allow me.

375
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,870
What would you do if you were in my shoes?

376
00:33:53,870 --> 00:34:00,330
Well, I would've thought of an alternative plan.

377
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:06,570
If that's what you thought, can I tell you my opinion?

378
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:10,350
When I was contemplating about the issue

379
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:12,440
someone recommended me a candidate.

380
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:16,280
Who is it? It's my turn to help you.

381
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:21,140
I'll nominate the candidate at the board of the directors' meeting.

382
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:25,290
Is that so? I feel like I'm on top of the world.

383
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:29,040
I don't know if you heard of him but...

384
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,190
What are you discussing about?

385
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:47,060
Isn't Yun Jin having a fast recovery if she moved to a regular room?

386
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:49,360
Yeah. Aren't you going to come and visit?

387
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:53,370
I will. I bet she's upset.

388
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:56,800
Isn't she unique?

389
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,760
I can't believe she goes on strikes with that kind of patients.

390
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,380
She seems to live life to the fullest.

391
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:08,400
I think she has a lot in common with you because you both are rigid.

392
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:13,990
I can't believe I have so many boring people around me.

393
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:18,660
I agree. The stew looks great.

394
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:32,480
From the looks of you drinking, I guess you met your match.

395
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,910
Guess who it'll be out of the two.

396
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:38,820
I don't have to look.

397
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:41,630
It'll be Dr. Roh Min Kook who graduated from John Hopkins.

398
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:43,730
He's the best liver transplant surgeon from brain-dead donors.

399
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:47,150
His works have been on SCI 73 times.

400
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:51,560
- How did you know?
- Chief Lee told me.

401
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,290
He must've come by.

402
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:58,700
I'm upset. Why did he make me eavesdrop on an important issue like that and make me spy?

403
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,850
Who did he come with?

404
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:04,100
The chief of thoracic surgery.

405
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:07,470
They watch over each other's backs.

406
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:11,320
Are you confident to beat Dr. Roh?

407
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:16,400
Dr. Roh... he's the only one I consider a bigshot in my field.

408
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:22,250
Stop. Mention the replies from liver transplant patients.

409
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:23,700
Next.

410
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,130
Stop.

411
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:30,280
Mention the 90% success rate.

412
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,270
Next. Okay.

413
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:34,910
This will end my report on the 100 case study of dividing the liver

414
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:38,460
and transplanting them to two recipients.

415
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:40,420
Turn on the lights.

416
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:49,500
- The editing seems great.
- Are there any questions?

417
00:36:56,410 --> 00:37:02,380
What are the risks of the procedure?

418
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:17,160
Just like any other liver transplant procedures

419
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,920
your liver may malfunction or have an adverse reaction.

420
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,640
Do you consider that a question?

421
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,440
Doctors are coming from around the world.

422
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,510
Who would ask such a pathetic question?

423
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:34,040
Dr. Jang, I think you've been too negligent.

424
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,520
Shouldn't you do the best until the very end?

425
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:39,240
I'm sorry.

426
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:42,920
Due to the time constraint, let's end this here.

427
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:47,480
Before lunch, I want 3 questions from each of you.

428
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:02,910
I want you guys to stay.

429
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:17,410
- How could he still haze in this day and age?
- I don't think that's the case.

430
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:23,330
What do you mean? Everyone knows the department of surgery is the strictest.

431
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:27,130
If something were to happen, I wouldn't have honorary retirement.

432
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:31,780
- I'll make sure that won't happen.
- Do a good job.

433
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,390
Chief!

434
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:44,460
Can you give me the list of the guests for the symposium?

435
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:46,900
I don't have one.

436
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:54,690
The chief resident told me you printed out resumes of our special guests.

437
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,510
- He said Dr. Roh and...
- Oh, that.

438
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:04,400
It's not for the symposium.

439
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:09,700
The surgical association needed it to make a handbook.

440
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,710
I see. Why would you do that in person?

441
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:13,720
I can do that for you.

442
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:17,340
No, it's okay. I already sent it.

443
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:19,320
Keep up the good work.

444
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,330
Did everything go well yesterday?

445
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:37,250
Yes. I had positive responses.

446
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:41,300
- I hope everything works out.
- Me too.

447
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:52,320
Tell him we'll have to think about it.

448
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,040
Didn't you want to do this?

449
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:03,600
That's before I knew his relationship with Dr. Woo Yong Kil.

450
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,970
I've observed Dr. Choi for the past 10 years.

451
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:08,170
And he's a wonderful doctor!

452
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:13,690
I know, but it won't be wise to upset Dr. Woo.

453
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:16,200
Let's disregard his proposal.

454
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:26,940
Hi Dr. Oh.

455
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:31,020
- Do you have a meeting?
- I have a seminar.

456
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:37,040
Everyone will appreciate it because you're such a good speaker.

457
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,560
Oh, stop it.

458
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:45,490
It seems like many good researches cannot be done due to the tight budget.

459
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:51,890
I know you're busy, but can you choose the best projects?

460
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:53,340
Is that so?

461
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:57,640
Isn't that what the assistant director is for?

462
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:00,810
Goodbye.

463
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,550
- Dr Yoo!
- Hello.

464
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:11,940
I'm sorry I'm late.

465
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:14,620
Let's go in. He's doing his seminar.

466
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:23,870
Did you see my watch at the room salon?

467
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:29,450
I forgot I was holding onto it.

468
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:33,920
Thank you. I thought I lost it.

469
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,310
I'm sorry I was wearing it. I didn't want to lose it.

470
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:38,330
No, it's okay. Let's go in.

471
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:42,680
<i>Understanding Gerontology</i>
 Gerontology is the study of aging.

472
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,300
It can be divided into

473
00:41:44,300 --> 00:42:07,710
Biological Gerontology, Social Gerontology, and Geriatric Medicine.

474
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:10,410
Today

475
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:19,160
I'll be covering geriatrics along with social gerontology

476
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:28,860
to emphasize the importance of this field.

477
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:32,030
Generally speaking

478
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:34,730
a person over the age 65 should consult with a Geriatrician.

479
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:39,980
However, a geriatrician should be consulted

480
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:47,070
when an older person has considerable impairment and frailty.

481
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:50,170
Come on in.

482
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:57,230
I was impressed by your seminar.

483
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:02,030
Let me introduce you to Dr. Min.

484
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:06,110
He's the vice chair of the medical association and also Dr. Jang's father in law.

485
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:10,620
- I see.
- My name is Min Choong Sik.

486
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:14,340
No wonder Dr. Jang came.

487
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:19,440
He said he was busy and went back to the hospital.

488
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:24,740
He said he couldn't miss this seminar for the world.

489
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:26,430
Really?

490
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:34,910
I'm sorry for burdening you.

491
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:36,540
Oh...

492
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:44,260
This is the stipend for the seminar.

493
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:47,150
It's only the amount for gas.

494
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:49,090
Thank you.

495
00:43:49,090 --> 00:43:51,900
I want to give you more, but it's a fixed fee.

496
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:55,310
Instead I'll buy you a wonderful dinner.

497
00:43:55,310 --> 00:43:56,250
Let's go.

498
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:57,540
Okay.

499
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:00,070
Let's go.

500
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:34,800
- You should've waited inside.
- Because I was nervous.

501
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:39,390
- How's everything?
- It's not easy.

502
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:42,320
I didn't bring money because he didn't want me to.

503
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:45,370
- Father.
- Okay.

504
00:44:45,370 --> 00:44:50,400
Let's just trust Dr. Yoo since he's very suave.

505
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:06,770
Should I order more alcohol?

506
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:08,540
It's okay, have a seat.

507
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:11,700
- I was out of line.
- No, it's okay.

508
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:14,800
Good friends tend to fight.

509
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:20,310
Of course, I'm jealous of your friendship.

510
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,270
Here.

511
00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:27,680
Come in!

512
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:46,210
Would you like to give him a shot? He must be thirsty.

513
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:51,140
- Let's have a drink.
- Yes.

514
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:03,000
Dr. Jang, you need to serve Dr. Woo well.

515
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,150
- Yes, I will.
- Do your best.

516
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:15,780
If you're going to help him, help him all the way.

517
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:19,050
Fine, fine.

518
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:24,060
- Let's work together.
- Thank you.

519
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:55,680
The construction progress is pretty fast.

520
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:59,170
Yes it is. It's looking good.

521
00:46:59,170 --> 00:47:01,520
Is the director's office at the top?

522
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:05,120
- I suppose.
- You have to be the next director.

523
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:07,330
We'll have to see.

524
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,890
By the way, I've made my decision on the transfer.

525
00:47:11,890 --> 00:47:14,430
Is that so?

526
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:18,820
But we'll be sending Dr. Moon instead of Dr. Jang in your department.

527
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:20,450
Pardon?

528
00:47:20,450 --> 00:47:23,510
I think there will be more losses than gains.

529
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:26,680
Everyone was against sending him.

530
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:33,640
- What's wrong?
- I feel dizzy.

531
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:36,820
I see.

532
00:47:39,950 --> 00:47:43,470
It's a relief. I was about to write a petition.

533
00:47:43,470 --> 00:47:46,800
Really? Did the interns obey you?

534
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:51,080
They said they would since I was leading.

535
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:54,070
- Thank you.
- No problem.

536
00:47:54,070 --> 00:47:58,780
I need to print Dr. Koh's invitations out. Who should I say is hosting it?

537
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:00,350
What are you talking about?

538
00:48:00,350 --> 00:48:03,950
The chief should be the host since Dr. Koh is from our department

539
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:07,000
but not many people will show up.

540
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:12,020
If the assistant director is the host, it'll be a success, but he's an internist.

541
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:15,740
Yes. Besides, the chief is not in a good mood right now.

542
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:20,940
- If the assistant director is the host...
- We shouldn't do that.

543
00:48:24,290 --> 00:48:27,420
Let's have the chief as the host. We shouldn't upset him.

544
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:29,450
Okay.

545
00:48:29,450 --> 00:48:32,900
- Let's follow the rules.
- Yes.

546
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:39,930
- I understand.
- The president was very grateful.

547
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:43,190
He really wanted to invest in your research.

548
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:49,020
So I was wondering if we could buy you a new machine

549
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:53,820
since you used a lot of our pharmaceutical products in your research.

550
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:54,860
No thanks.

551
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:59,630
The president and I both think that you shouldn't stop this valuable research.

552
00:48:59,630 --> 00:49:03,950
I could buy you a cell growth chamber

553
00:49:03,950 --> 00:49:12,130
and we'll provide all the reagents and experimental mice you need

554
00:49:12,130 --> 00:49:14,700
The president already approved it.

555
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:18,330
If things settle down, we'll officially sponsor it.

556
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:22,440
Can you temporarily continue the research like this?

557
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:29,100
Thank you. Please send my thanks to your president.

558
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:30,580
Yes.

559
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:34,380
There are no such things as secrets in life.

560
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:38,890
Besides, my research cannot be secretively done.

561
00:49:38,890 --> 00:49:44,040
Please mention to your president

562
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:47,190
I would wait until he can officially sponsor my research.

563
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:52,220
Honestly, everyone does this under the table.

564
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:54,780
Let's be the ones who play it by the rules.

565
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,430
Thank you.

566
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:14,400
It's such a nice painting. I'm so happy.

567
00:50:15,570 --> 00:50:19,850
The painting looks better here in my house.

568
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:24,750
- It looks more graceful.
- You hung it at your house.

569
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:29,710
Sorry? For a while...

570
00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:33,780
- I'm sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

571
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:37,440
I can't believe we're our husbands' puppets.

572
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:41,050
That's why they say a woman's fate depends on her husband.

573
00:50:41,050 --> 00:50:43,000
What?

574
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:47,410
I can't believe you're saying that in this day and age.

575
00:50:47,410 --> 00:50:51,010
Sorry? Isn't it so?

576
00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:55,200
I guess it's somewhat true.

577
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:01,110
Do you want to go shopping to make us feel better?

578
00:51:01,110 --> 00:51:03,710
- Pardon?
- Let's go, I'll buy you a purse.

579
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:06,390
That isn't necessary.

580
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:12,490
- I know you want one.
- Of course, I do!

581
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:19,450
- It's a big problem.
- I think you jumped the gun.

582
00:51:19,450 --> 00:51:22,130
Just because the assistant director made

583
00:51:22,130 --> 00:51:24,180
that decision doesn't mean he's partnering up with Dr. Jang.

584
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:26,510
He probably had his reasons not to transfer him.

585
00:51:26,510 --> 00:51:32,370
No, we've had coffee together before, and they were pretty close.

586
00:51:32,370 --> 00:51:35,860
I should've known then. What if...

587
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:40,210
Don't overreact. If so, there's always another way.

588
00:51:40,210 --> 00:51:41,980
What is it?

589
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:44,150
If they grabbed hands with the assistant director

590
00:51:44,150 --> 00:51:48,830
we'll have to work with Dr. Oh.

591
00:51:48,830 --> 00:51:53,170
He's the most revered person in the medical field, so he's very influential.

592
00:51:53,170 --> 00:51:57,730
Also, he doesn't like people like Dr. Jang.

593
00:51:57,730 --> 00:52:00,390
That's right, he doesn't.

594
00:52:00,390 --> 00:52:05,680
Leave Dr. Oh to me. I'll be sure to persuade him.

595
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:11,660
Okay, I'll rely on you, but we need to do this immediately.

596
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,860
In 2000, Dr. Lee Seung Kyu and

597
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:18,110
his surgically team at the Asan Medical Center successfully transplanted livers

598
00:52:18,110 --> 00:52:20,430
from 2 people into one patient for the first time in history.

599
00:52:20,430 --> 00:52:27,910
There were many participants due to the family-oriented Korean society.

600
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:32,730
Our hospital has also performed this procedure

601
00:52:32,730 --> 00:52:38,300
150 times and has a 95% success rate.

602
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:44,740
Do you have any questions?

603
00:52:49,130 --> 00:52:52,020
Please go ahead.

604
00:52:57,730 --> 00:53:00,600
Congratulations on an amazing success rate.

605
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:05,230
I was wondering if two partial organs were transplanted in

606
00:53:05,230 --> 00:53:13,670
wouldn't they sink below and as a result cause poor blood circulation.

607
00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:16,380
... place of an original size liver...

608
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:18,730
That's a wonderful question.

609
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:20,710
In order to prevent that from happening

610
00:53:20,710 --> 00:53:26,810
we insert a tissue extender to fill in the empty space.

611
00:53:26,810 --> 00:53:28,990
However, wouldn't the extender enlarge

612
00:53:28,990 --> 00:53:31,680
the partial liver and become a hindrance?

613
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:35,330
It may if you were to leave in its original state.

614
00:53:35,330 --> 00:53:38,850
We will monitor the organ growth

615
00:53:38,850 --> 00:53:43,220
through a CT scan and remove water when necessary.

616
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:46,040
Then you would have to remove the tissue extender

617
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:49,090
once the organ has growed to its full size.

618
00:53:49,090 --> 00:53:50,650
Yes, that's correct.

619
00:53:50,650 --> 00:54:00,120
The timing of the surgery will vary depending on the recipient's condition.

620
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:04,590
Yes, thanks for answering my question.

621
00:54:04,590 --> 00:54:07,990
Can you tell me who you are?

622
00:54:07,990 --> 00:54:09,990
I'm sorry I didn't introduce myself.

623
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:14,080
My name is Roh Min Kook, and I'm from Johns Hopkins.

624
00:54:43,270 --> 00:54:46,720
Let me introduce you to Dr. Jang Jun Hyuk.

625
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:50,280
I'm Roh Min Kook, I always wanted to meet you.

626
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:54,460
I too wanted to meet you.

627
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:58,550
I was impressed by your article on the Lancet.

628
00:54:58,550 --> 00:54:59,830
Thank you.

629
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:03,170
I also read up on all your articles that you release.

630
00:55:03,170 --> 00:55:06,570
Thank you. Let's discuss about our research.

631
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:09,240
Aren't you busy, Dr. Jang?

632
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:13,800
He's busy wrapping things up. You should go now.

633
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:25,350
By the way, who's the host for Dr. Koh's 77th birthday reception?

634
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:33,830
It's the assistant director, Dr. Woo Yong Kil.

635
00:55:40,050 --> 00:55:43,410
When did my name change to this?

636
00:55:43,410 --> 00:55:46,210
This reception isn't necessarily for the medical staff.

637
00:55:46,210 --> 00:55:50,980
It'll be more effective if the assistant director hosts it

638
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:54,580
because we'll have more guests and receive more donations.

639
00:55:54,580 --> 00:56:00,390
That may be so, but it'll seem pretentious if we receive donations.

640
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:04,900
Change the host to me, even if we have to reduce the budget.

641
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:06,490
I think that'll be difficult to do.

642
00:56:06,490 --> 00:56:07,510
Difficult?

643
00:56:07,510 --> 00:56:13,120
I've already sent out the invitations to confirm the RSVPS.

644
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:14,510
It'll arrive...

645
00:56:14,510 --> 00:56:18,820
You say you discuss matters with me, but you always do things on your own.

646
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:22,010
- I was trying to rapidly...
- Forget it.

647
00:56:22,010 --> 00:56:24,620
That's what bothers me about you the most.

648
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:30,340
I warned you many times, but you never changed.

649
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:33,140
You'll have to fill in my shoes when I retire.

650
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:36,490
If you keep this up, even if I recommend you

651
00:56:36,490 --> 00:56:39,150
people will oppose of you.

652
00:56:39,150 --> 00:56:41,470
Along with being a good surgeon

653
00:56:41,470 --> 00:56:44,170
you have to be insightful and have a good personality to be a good doctor.

654
00:56:44,170 --> 00:56:48,890
I'm trying to change according to your constructive feedback.

655
00:56:48,890 --> 00:56:51,860
But you haven't at all!

656
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:09,910
If you keep this up

657
00:57:09,910 --> 00:57:15,350
I maybe not be able to recommend you as chief of surgery even if I want to.

658
00:57:15,350 --> 00:57:18,710
What if that happens to you?

659
00:57:18,710 --> 00:57:21,900
I highly doubt that would happen.

660
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:27,310
If that were to happen,

661
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:34,800
I won't stay put.
