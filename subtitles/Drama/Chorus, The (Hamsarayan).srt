1
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,100
Come in, please.

2
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,700
Pierre, it's a call from France,
it's urgent.

3
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,100
After the concert.

4
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,500
It's about your mother.

5
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,500
Yes?

6
00:01:17,501 --> 00:01:23,501
Chorists

7
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,700
Do you recognise me?

8
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:08,200
" Pond Bottom", " my father will pick me up on Saturday".

9
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,100
Pepinot

10
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,900
But of course.

11
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,000
Pepinot! How long has it been?

12
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,600
Only 50 years.

13
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,200
"Pond Bottom".

14
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,300
There you are, the short one in the first row.

15
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,000
And this is you.

16
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,200
And the prefect, what was his name?

17
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,100
Clement Mathieu

18
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,800
Clement Mathieu

19
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,200
What became of him?

20
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,800
Open it.

21
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,300
"Pond Bottom" -- year 1949

22
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:58,800
This is the diary kept by Mathieu,
about his days at "Pond Bottom".

23
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,700
About his story, and ours too.

24
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,800
He wanted you to have it.

25
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,900
I'd prefer to give it to you
under happier circumstances but...

26
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,200
1949, Jan. 15th.

27
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,900
After a few years of failure,

28
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,700
I was certain the worst was yet to come.

29
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,900
It was a boarding school for difficult children.

30
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,800
At least that's what the ad said.

31
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,100
"Pond Bottom"

32
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,400
The school seemed to be named just for me.

33
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,200
Good morning.

34
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,200
You are alone?

35
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,600
What are you doing here?

36
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,700
I'm waiting for Saturday.

37
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,600
Why?

38
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,400
Because my father will come and fetch me.

39
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,200
But today is not Saturday.

40
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,300
Pepinot!

41
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,300
I'm Clement Mathieu, the new prefect.

42
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,400
Is this your first prefect position?

43
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,100
I once taught in a private school.

44
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,400
-What did you teach?
-Music.

45
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,600
-You will get on well with Mr. Rachin

46
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,800
The Headmaster. He used to play the trumpet.

47
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,400
Really?

48
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,100
These are his daughters, he lives here.

49
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,800
-Have you met him before?
-Not yet, I got the job through Mme Boissement.

50
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,100
Really?

51
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,600
That was Uncle Maxence

52
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,900
He proceeded to explain that he was in charge of...

53
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,900
security, first aid,
store room, and window repair.

54
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,300
What is he doing?

55
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,600
Student punished by Mr Rachin.

56
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,300
15 days of community service... Maid work

57
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,200
What are the kids like?

58
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,900
Didn't they tell you?

59
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,000
No.

60
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,300
This is the infirmary.
Later I will show you my little vegetable patch.

61
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,700
With pleasure.

62
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,500
-What have they done this time?
-Let's me help you...

63
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,500
Are you Clement Mathieu?

64
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,400
The Headmaster.

65
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,300
Rachin, Headmaster.

66
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,800
Ah, Headmaster, I am sorry.

67
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,200
Yes, you are late.

68
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,500
-I was given the wrong bus timetable.
-Keeping on time is a basic principle here.

69
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,100
Very well.

70
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,600
Headmaster.

71
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,900
Very well, headmaster.

72
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,100
Ok, follow me.

73
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:27,100
I first suggest you learn our regulations.
You will supervise study after 4pm.

74
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,500
What's the matter! Answer!

75
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,600
-Take this

76
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,300
Another trap.
Our pupils' lovely disposition.

77
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,400
Let's sit him down there.

78
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,900
I can't see.

79
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,300
Don't overdo it, let me take a look.

80
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,000
Not so good.

81
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:51,100
-You, go ring the bell, call everyone.
-Shouldn't we call a doctor first?

82
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,500
You know how much they cost?
What did I tell you, go ring the bell.

83
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,100
Where is the bell?

84
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,900
Open the door, you'll see it.

85
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,700
Everyone here!

86
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,500
Everyone here!

87
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,000
Does this kind of incident often happen?

88
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,200
Ring, just ring the bell.

89
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,800
Everyone in the yard!

90
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,700
Quickly, keep quiet.

91
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:41,200
- Egg head!
- Quiet!

92
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,300
-Bullet head!
-Quiet!

93
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,700
Keep quiet.

94
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,000
-I didn't say anything!
-Quiet!

95
00:07:54,700 --> 00:08:00,700
I've called you out because Uncle Maxence
has just been wounded in a cowardly attack.

96
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:04,400
According to our "action-reaction" principle,
the one responsible shall be severely punished.

97
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:08,600
If the guilty one does not turn himself in
within 3 seconds,

98
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,700
You will all take turns in jail, 6 hours each.

99
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:18,200
Until he turns himself in or is denounced.

100
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,500
One two three

101
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,900
No one? Naturally.

102
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,900
Come here.

103
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,200
You, Mathieu

104
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,000
Me?

105
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,700
Come here.

106
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:36,500
Mr. Chabert, give me the record book, thank you

107
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,500
Mr. Mathieu, the new prefect,
is fortunate not to know you yet.

108
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,600
Egg head!

109
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,600
Be quiet.

110
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,600
He will therefore decide impartially
who will be punished first.

111
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,700
Be quiet!

112
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,700
Pick a name.

113
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,200
At random?

114
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,400
If I may...

115
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,800
Leave him. Go ahead

116
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,700
Boniface

117
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,400
Unlucky. Chabert, bring Boniface out.

118
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,400
But, I didn't do anything!

119
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,200
Shut up!

120
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,000
It's unfair!
Shut your mouth! Let's go.

121
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,300
I won't go!
I'll kick your ass if I have to!

122
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,400
Quiet!

123
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:24,900
In addition, as long as the criminal is at large,
recess is canceled,

124
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,300
And visits are forbidden.

125
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,800
I invite you to denounce him as fast as possible.

126
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,500
This only encourages denouncing.

127
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:36,700
Like all new-comers, you have generous illusions.
Let's talk again in a week.

128
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:41,000
Until then have Mr Regent show you your quarters.
You're taking over from him.

129
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,700
Clean sheets.

130
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,200
Thanks.

131
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,800
Why are you leaving?

132
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,700
10 stitches

133
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,200
Scissors.

134
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,300
All this because I confiscated Mouton's cigarettes.

135
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,200
Mouton?

136
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,500
A kid. His name is Mouton.

137
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:10,600
Is he still here, this Mouton?

138
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,200
For your info, Le Querrec is the one who set the trap
on Maxence's door.


139
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,300
I overheard him talking about it.

140
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,500
Why did you keep silent?

141
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,900
I don't want to miss the bus.

142
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,600
Maxence punished him for breaking some window panes.

143
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:26,100
It's a revenge. Just his style.

144
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,700
Le Querrec, you have remember this name.

145
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,800
And "Morange", yes, "Morange"

146
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,100
He speaks little, but you have to keep an eye on him.

147
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,500
Angel face, but possessed by the devil.

148
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,500
Action/reaction, that's all they understand.

149
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,700
I'm leaving. Good luck!

150
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,200
Thank you.

151
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,800
Our benefactor.

152
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,900
This is the class schedule.

153
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,100
Classes were split between the headmaster,
doing history and French,

154
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,900
while the rest was taught by a certain
Mr Langlois.

155
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,500
Mr. Langlois, let me introduce our new prefect.

156
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,800
My name is Clement Mathieu

157
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,600
A prefect at your age?

158
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,900
Yes, I was once a teacher.

159
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,500
That is perfect.

160
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,900
He's the funniest of the lot.

161
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,100
Go to the study room now - You are late.

162
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,300
No need to show you the way...

163
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,900
Gentlemen.

164
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:15,100
Smoking is forbidden in class, everyone, even you, sir.

165
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,300
Give it back to me, quiet!

166
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,100
Give it back to me.

167
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,600
Good start!

168
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,500
Congratulations. Mathieu

169
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,200
Be seated.

170
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,100
Naturally. You, always you.

171
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,100
What did he do?

172
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,700
Nothing. Headmaster

173
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,700
What do you mean, nothing.

174
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,300
Didn't you want to punish him just now?

175
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:57,900
I was asking him to the blackboard,
and requesting silence when you came in.

176
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:03,500
Indeed you needed silence.
Don't let me have to come back.

177
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,900
Go to the corner.

178
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:18,500
All right. Now that you know me better,
we need to set a few things straight.

179
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,900
Right now, one of your fellow pupils is in jail.

180
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,700
For nothing.

181
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:28,500
I may not look smart,
but I was not born yesterday.

182
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,500
I know who did it.

183
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,700
I give him 15 seconds to confess.

184
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,500
I am waiting.

185
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,100
Too bad. Only 5 seconds left.

186
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,900
Too late.

187
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,600
Le Querrec, who is Le Querrec

188
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,000
Me , sir

189
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,800
What a coincidence.

190
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,900
So, it is you who wounded Mr. Maxence.

191
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,200
No. not me.

192
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,100
I am not asking you. I am telling you.

193
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,000
I did nothing.

194
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,700
Who do you think the headmaster will believe,
you or me?

195
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,100
While I am out, I would like someone serious
to watch over the class.

196
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,000
If I believe my trusted intuition,

197
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,600
this serious person is Mr Morange.

198
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,500
Be quiet, who is Morange?

199
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,800
Me, sir.

200
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,800
So, you are the angel face

201
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,700
Go to the blackboard.
You watch the class while I am out.

202
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,800
Let's go!

203
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,400
Nice attire.

204
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,800
Pull your shirt out further,
it's more proper.

205
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:49,700
Black sheep are said to have authority over their peers.
Prove it to me.


206
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,300
Let's go. To the headmaster.

207
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,400
Have mercy, sir.

208
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,300
Mercy?

209
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,200
Did you show mercy on the classmate
who is in jail instead of you?

210
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,000
How about Uncle Maxence?

211
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,300
I didn't want to harm him. It was just a joke.

212
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,000
A joke?

213
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It's enough. Do you hear,
You'll get a good beating in my office.

214
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,400
Who is that?

215
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,500
It's Leclerc, he ran away for the third time.

216
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,900
He will be sent to jail.

217
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,800
This way you'll have a companion. Let's go.

218
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,400
No.

219
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,600
Listen. Maybe we can make a deal.

220
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,100
You wounded uncle Maxence badly. Really bad.

221
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,800
I will not bring you to the headmaster,
but I'll punish you.

222
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:43,700
From now on, during recess,
you'll work in the infirmary.

223
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:48,500
You will look after Uncle Maxence,
until he is recovered.

224
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,900
Do you agree?

225
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,100
Not bad, ah?

226
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,600
I believe I can do better. Show me your profile.

227
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,200
Profile.

228
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,400
I give you a little smile for a change.

229
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,000
There you go. Have a look.

230
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,400
Ah, I forget.

231
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,300
A little spot of colour.

232
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,900
Does it look better? Go back to you seat.

233
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,500
All right, in order to know you better,

234
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:56,000
Please write down your name, age and what you want to do
when you grow up.

235
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,100
To my surprise,

236
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,100
all the pupils did as they were asked.

237
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,000
Everybody, expect one.

238
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,100
Aren't you writing?

239
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,100
How long have you been here?

240
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,900
A long time?

241
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,800
I don't know.

242
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,900
Come on, write, little boy.

243
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,300
An exhausting first day.

244
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,500
I don't know why I am here.

245
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,800
Rachin scares me. This place scares me.

246
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,200
Even the kids scare me.

247
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:01,900
I feel they may run into my room at any time
and do me in.

248
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,200
My blanket.

249
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,100
Give me a puff.
Shut up. Go to sleep.

250
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,100
I read what the pupils wrote.

251
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,000
They were all dreaming of fabulous carreers.

252
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,200
Two firemen, three cowboys, one tiger-tamer,
one fighter pilot

253
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,900
two spies, a general under Napoleon.

254
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,300
one hot air balloon pilot, three soldiers.
No prefect.

255
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,700
It's very kind to volunteer to take care of me.

256
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:49,800
See, doctor, the new prefect asked for a volunteer.

257
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,300
And he responded. Spontaneously.

258
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,200
This shows miracles do happen.

259
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,800
Please come in.

260
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,700
This is Mr. Mathieu, our new prefect.

261
00:19:01,301 --> 00:19:02,301
How are you
How are you

262
00:19:02,402 --> 00:19:03,202
How is he?

263
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:09,600
It's quite a bad gash.
If now they come after you, hope is lost.

264
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,800
You have such infinite patience towards them.

265
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,500
I'm hard headed.

266
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,100
The poor kids have it way worse than me here.

267
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,000
One of them died here.

268
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,200
One died?

269
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,400
His name was Mouton.
Jumped from the rooftop.

270
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,200
Fortunately, he was an orphan.

271
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,400
Like him, everyone says nothing can be done.
But that's not true.

272
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,700
He's a good boy.
You just need to know him.

273
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,800
Uncle Maxence is kind, isn't he?

274
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,300
Le Querrec, I am talking to you.

275
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,800
Uncle Maxence is kind, isn't he?

276
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,100
Yes.

277
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,100
I can't hear you.

278
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,800
Leave him alone. He is shy, just like me.

279
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,500
Yes?

280
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,600
I need to talk to you. Headmaster.

281
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,200
You already want to leave?
No, I just want to do an experiment.

282
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,900
About uncle Maxence's accident.

283
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,400
That was no accident.

284
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,300
Sure. I would like you to grant me three things.

285
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,600
What?

286
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,500
First, lift the collective punishment.

287
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,900
Second, allow me to punish the guilty one.

288
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,900
Third, please allow me to keep his name to myself.

289
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,000
Provided you have the name.

290
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,100
Of course, only provided I have it.

291
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,000
You are arrogant, man.

292
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,300
So, you believe you can find him just like that.

293
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,600
Alright. If you succeed,
I'll lift the punishment.

294
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,800
You'll never find the guilty party,
or I am the king of imbeciles.

295
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,200
I know who did it, sir.

296
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,000
Is that so. Who is it?

297
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,000
You allowed me to keep his name a secret.

298
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,900
Good, very good.

299
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,500
But your methods irritate me.

300
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,300
Don't let me find anything wrong with your class.

301
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,600
I feel I already have them well under control.

302
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,400
You speak too soon.

303
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,600
These are not naughty pictures.

304
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,400
I never said they were naughty pictures.

305
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,300
What's written on yours?

306
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,100
Ave Maria, Soprano, by Clement Mathieu

307
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:35,200
Mine says cord quatuor, by Clement Mathieu

308
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,900
This looks like music sheets.

309
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
How do you know?

310
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,100
Maybe it's morse code?

311
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,300
Secret codes?

312
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,800
Maybe he's a spy.

313
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,500
Yes, possibly a spy disguised as a prefect.

314
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,700
Quick! Egghead is coming.

315
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,900
Give it back to me.

316
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,100
What is it, sir.

317
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,400
None of your business.

318
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,000
Any problem, Mathieu?

319
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,000
No, nothing.

320
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,700
These are music sheets.

321
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,900
What for?

322
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,000
A choir

323
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:16,300
In the toilet...

324
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,300
Choir, out you go.

325
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,800
None of this here, Mathieu
None of what?

326
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,600
Don't pretend you don't know what
I am talking about.

327
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,500
Certainly you don't believe...

328
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,600
I'll close one eye this time.

329
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,500
You really see evil everywhere.
Here? Yes.

330
00:22:53,299 --> 00:22:55,699
Bullet head you're finished.

331
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,500
You won't make the rules here.

332
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,500
You won't make the rules here.

333
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,500
You won't make the rules here.

334
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,600
You won't make the rules here.

335
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,900
Hey, guys, are you chicken or what?

336
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,300
Your name is Corbin, right?

337
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,500
Sir, I did nothing.

338
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,700
Yes, you are singing.

339
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,800
Sir, I swear.

340
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,000
You are singing, besides, off-key.

341
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,800
You don't even know.

342
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:26,500
Come on, sing again, I am listening.

343
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,000
Maybe you want to sing in the principal's office.

344
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,200
Come on, sing: Bullet head you're finished.

345
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,100
Bullet head you're finished.

346
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,800
You won't make the rules here.

347
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,000
You won't make the rules here.

348
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,800
No one ever told you that you sing really bad...

349
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,800
Is it true you have music in your briefcase, sir?

350
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,900
Mind your own business.

351
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,200
Which reminds me.

352
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:56,800
The next one I catch going through my things,
it will cost him dearly.

353
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:01,000
Now, silence.
Go to sleep. Finished.

354
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,600
Sleep.

355
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,300
I have this tune stuck in my head.

356
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,300
They don't sing very well, but they sing.

357
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:45,200
I even spotted a few good voices.

358
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,600
Is there really nothing we can do with these kids?

359
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,400
Me who swore never to touch my music sheets again.

360
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,800
Never say never.

361
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,000
There's always something to try.

362
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,800
January 23, one week after the accident.

363
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,400
uncle Maxence's takes a turn for the worse.

364
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,300
The doctor has him sent to the hospital.

365
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,300
Will he die?

366
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,900
No, they will save him.

367
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,300
That same day, Pepinot got in trouble.

368
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,600
Mr. Pepinot, you are hopeless.

369
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,800
Last question, last one

370
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,000
How did Marshall Ney die?

371
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,700
I am waiting.

372
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,400
Hunting?

373
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,800
Zero.

374
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,800
You'll write a 100 times for tomorrow:
Marshall Ney was executed.

375
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,200
Dismissed

376
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,300
Boniface

377
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,500
Come here boy.

378
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,800
Boniface

379
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,200
Here. It's a reward for your composition

380
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,800
You take this to madam Marie, she will give you a biscuit.

381
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,200
You did know that Marshall Ney was shot?

382
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,900
Yes, sir, just like Napoleon.

383
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,500
Get out.

384
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,400
Wait, Mr. Morange

385
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,500
I saw you taking notes during my class.

386
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,100
I must say such studiousness surprises me.

387
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,600
Bring me your notebook.

388
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,400
Charming.

389
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:11,400
There. Read it. Admire the spelling.

390
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,000
Mr. Rachin eats shit by the crate.

391
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,600
Did he write 'Mr.'?

392
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,600
Err, no

393
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:27,500
Mr. Mathieu, action and reaction, put him in jail.

394
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,200
Let's go

395
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,500
Gentlemen, good appetite.

396
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,700
Are you hungry Pepinot?

397
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,500
There, you can eat now.

398
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,000
Pepinot is an orphan.

399
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,000
His parents died during the war.

400
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,200
How did they die?
Don't know.

401
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:20,600
The kid got it in his head that
his father will come pick him up on Saturday.

402
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,700
Every Saturday, nobody comes.

403
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,200
We tell him it's for next week, and so on.

404
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,000
Wouldn't it be better to tell him the truth?

405
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:32,900
We told him a 100 times that his dad and mum are both dead.
Nothing doing.

406
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:37,100
Now, we let him wait by  the gate,
it makes him happy.

407
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,800
Be quiet.

408
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,400
You see? Action and reaction.

409
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,500
What do you mean?

410
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,400
Action? Reaction!

411
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,200
Someone is asking for the Morange boy.

412
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,800
Morange? He is in jail.

413
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,600
No visit for the punished ones. You know the rules

414
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,900
You go tell the visitor yourself.

415
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,700
How are you, madam.

416
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,100
How are you.

417
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,000
I am the new prefect.

418
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I am Pierre Morange's mother.

419
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,500
Clement Mathieu

420
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:37,500
I know it's not visiting day today,
but it's the only free time...

421
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,700
That's not it...

422
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,400
He is punished again?

423
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,200
No, no, he is not punished.

424
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,400
But he is not here.

425
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,000
Why?

426
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,400
He was sent to the dentist an hour ago.
Tooth ache.

427
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,900
Tooth ache.

428
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,300
Yes tooth ache. But nothing serious.

429
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,400
He will be back in the evening.

430
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:01,500
I can't wait. My shift starts at 5pm.

431
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,000
Can I pass you something for him?

432
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,200
Of course.

433
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,500
Her name is Violette, Violette Morange

434
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,700
Single mother. Despairing over her son's attitude.

435
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:20,500
Prone to stealing, introvert.
Expelled from a few schools for running away.

436
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,400
When Pierre was sent to Pond Bottom
against his mother's will,

437
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:29,700
She told the judge: at least,
he'll have two warm meals a day.

438
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,800
Jan. 30, the experiment begins.

439
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,600
They wear round hats, long live the Bretons

440
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,500
They wear round hats, long live Britanny

441
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:44,200
They wear round hats, long live the Bretons

442
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,000
Soprano - Left side.

443
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,600
Leclerc

444
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:55,800
God's child is born, Let's all sing his coming.

445
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,200
Almost in tune.
Alto, stand left.

446
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,000
Delaire

447
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:05,700
Three kilometers on foot,
it's tough, it's tough

448
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,900
Three kilometers on foot,
it's tough on the shoes.

449
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Sing from the beginning.

450
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,100
Four kilometers on foot,
it's tough, it's tough

451
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,900
Four kilometers on foot,
it's tough on the shoes.

452
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,800
Like I thought, Bass, right.

453
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,400
Ricoeur

454
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,600
There's good tobacco in my snuffbox

455
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,000
There's good tobacco, but you won't get any.

456
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,600
Smoking is not allowed.

457
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,800
Alto, left

458
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,400
Ilouse

459
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,000
Love is like a Bohemian child,

460
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,600
It has never ever known any laws.

461
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:46,400
Tenor, of course. stand left.

462
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,300
Pepinot

463
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,100
I don't know any song .

464
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,700
Never mind, I'll teach you.

465
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:03,200
In the mean time, I nominate you
Choir assistant director.

466
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,600
Boniface

467
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,900
Marshall, here we are !

468
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,200
Who taught you this song?

469
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,800
My grandfather.

470
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,300
A bit out of fashion. Go left.

471
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,700
Clement

472
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:29,200
Take arms, citizens. Form your battalions.

473
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,900
Right

474
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:35,500
Prefects are the worst kind,
Smoking, drinking, never working.

475
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,600
Left

476
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:39,300
Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo

477
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,600
Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo

478
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,400
Very well, alto

479
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,800
Show me, Corbin?

480
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:23,500
Sorry, this note does not exist. Come here

481
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,400
Mr. Pepinot, give me the music score.

482
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,100
Thank you very much.

483
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,000
Open your hands

484
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,400
Present them like this.

485
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,900
I nominate you music stand.

486
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:40,100
Mr. Pepinot, baton, thanks a lot.

487
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,800
Attention. Follow me.

488
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,800
There you have it!

489
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,200
One two three four

490
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,200
The headmaster eats stale bread.

491
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,100
Lerlec is not very smart

492
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:07,700
Every night, I make them practice a simple tune
I compose.

493
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:12,600
We are from Pond Bottom.
That is rather disconcerting

494
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:16,300
We are from Pond Bottom.
That is what is bothering us

495
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:20,200
We are from Pond Bottom.
That is rather disconcerting

496
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:24,700
We are from Pond Bottom.
That is what is bothering us.

497
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,400
Not bad.

498
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,200
It was rather basic, but I had their attention.

499
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,500
To move things along, I needed support
from my hierarchy.

500
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,300
What?

501
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,700
A choir?

502
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,000
Yes

503
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:43,200
Poor Mathieu, you have gone off your rocker.

504
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:47,100
A choir? They will never sing a note, 
or I am the king of...

505
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,600
Please sir. Do not tell me king of what.

506
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,100
Why?

507
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,700
Because they are already singing.

508
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,300
Really?
A little.

509
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:59,000
So why do you come ask me for an authorisation
since you've already gone ahead.

510
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,900
I don't like your methods, you hear me?

511
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,900
Sir

512
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,400
You are bothering me.

513
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,300
I have other problems to deal with.

514
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:11,000
All right. I too want to have a laugh.
Make them sing.

515
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:15,200
But if things go wrong, you'll lose your job.
Go

516
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,800
Thank you for your kind words of encouragement, sir.

517
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:29,700
Feb. 8, first rehearsals.
Rachin is relentless on Morange

518
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:35,200
After jail, he makes an example out of him:
one month of community service.

519
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,600
Hey, maid, don't forget to make my bed!

520
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,600
Feb. 15

521
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:39,400
A visit from Dr. Dervaux. He is a psychologist

522
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,100
He brought us a little present.

523
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:46,000
We decided to bring this boy from St Fereol's juvenile detention centre.

524
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:51,200
To study his capacity to adapt to a more liberal environment.

525
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,900
Unlike most of his classmates,
Mondain is starting to read and write.

526
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,800
In any case, he can talk

527
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,400
More or less normally.

528
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,700
We submitted his intellect
to the Binet-Simon test

529
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,500
Ah, the Binet-Simon test!

530
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,400
We also gave him Rorchar's test

531
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,800
Good.

532
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,300
The test, as you know,
divides children's intelligent into 7 categories.

533
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:17,200
Normal, adequate, borderline,
Slightly retarded, medium, severely retarded

534
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,400
And finally, imbeciles

535
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,200
Mondain is in the borderline zone.

536
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,100
He is therefore not demented. I must however warn you.

537
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:31,800
He exhibit gregarious-instinct pervert tendencies.

538
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,500
Bad enough.

539
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,400
What exactly does that mean?

540
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:40,600
Doctor?

541
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:45,800
Prone to cruelty, parasitism and destruction. Above all,

542
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,300
Mythomania
There you have it.

543
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,000
We already have lots like that here.

544
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,200
Except here kids have access to maistream teaching.

545
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:57,000
It will be interesting to see how Mondain
can integrate

546
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,700
Least we can do.

547
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:02,300
We will all try to meet your scientific expectations.

548
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,400
Gentlemen, kindly take charge of this boy.

549
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,600
May I keep you for lunch?
With pleasure.

550
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,000
As for him, give him all the necessary attention.

551
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,600
Action and reaction.

552
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,700
No smoking here.

553
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:25,500
To start the experiment on a good footing,
I first have to establish my authority.

554
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,700
You really look like a jerk.

555
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,800
You better lie low, or there will be trouble.

556
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,400
Ok.

557
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,300
There will be trouble.

558
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,200
Surely you know at least one song?

559
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,500
Yes, but...

560
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:58,900
But what?

561
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,900
You will not like it.

562
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,900
Let's have it. Come on.

563
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,300
Come on

564
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,800
I am listening.

565
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,500
(Dirty song)

566
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,900
Stop

567
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,300
enough.

568
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,500
I told you.

569
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:29,900
Not bad, needs practice.
But you have quite a good baritone voice.

570
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,500
What voice?

571
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:35,800
baritone, it is not an insult.
Describes singers with a deep voice.

572
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,000
Go to the back, with the basses.

573
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:41,900
Bitch.

574
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:44,100
Let the bitch rest.

575
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,900
The next one who laughs gets my fist in his face.

576
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,100
Whenever you wish, Mondain

577
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,200
Isolation over

578
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:56,500
I brought Pepinot back. You forgot him by the gate.

579
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:59,700
Pepinot, it's not Saturday today.

580
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:04,900
By the way, in the letters to your parents

581
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,800
I don't have any parents.

582
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,200
Of course, to those who have parents

583
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:12,900
Remind them that they can visit you on 
the first or third Thursday of the month.

584
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,400
Morange, you are already distracted.
What did I just say?

585
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:18,700
I don't know.

586
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,700
I just said, you can write to your mother

587
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,300
To visit you on the first or third Thursday every month.

588
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,800
Or on both days, got it?

589
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:30,100
But punished pupils cannot get visits so be careful.
I don't feel like seeing my parents.

590
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,400
But Morange may want to see his mother.

591
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,300
Maybe he's not the only one.

592
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:39,600
See, Morange, we have a real choir now.

593
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,100
I don't care.

594
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,700
What do you mean you don't care?

595
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,200
What kind of voice do you have? Do a scale.

596
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,800
"Do"... Come on.

597
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,000
Do you want to go back to jail? Come on, quick.

598
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,500
Rudeness does not look good on you, my boy.

599
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:01,400
Not everyone can be like Mondain.

600
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,900
Let's start again.

601
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:06,600
Where are you going?

602
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:09,900
I've had enough, I am going to the toilet.
Mondain, wait.

603
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,300
Come,Corbin
Can I also go to the toilet,sir?

604
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,200
All right, everybody out.

605
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,200
Quiet, quiet

606
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,500
You sing well, pretty girl.

607
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,500
You want some?

608
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:01,500
They left you all alone? I will protect you.

609
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:06,200
Wait for me. We are alike.

610
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,900
My parents are assholes.

611
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,900
Your mother is the same way.

612
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,500
She leaves you here to have peace.

613
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,300
No, she has to work

614
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,300
-Ah, so what the others say is true.
-What?

615
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,800
She is a whore

616
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,500
Get in!

617
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,200
You're a dead man!

618
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,700
Am I?

619
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:47,300
That day, Morange was missing at the
3pm roll call.

620
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:28,300
No one ever knew where he went,
but he came back.

621
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,200
That's what mattered.

622
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:34,900
Why are you here?

623
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:42,600
I'm not allowed to go upstairs

624
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,400
What do you mean?

625
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,000
Why?

626
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,200
Because I have no money

627
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:53,700
You have no money, so you can't sleep?
What is this all about?

628
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:59,300
It's Mondain.
If I don't give him money, he won't let me upstairs.

629
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:05,800
We must be careful

630
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,900
Where I was before I was
caught by the prefect.

631
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:14,100
So I had to let him have it.

632
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,200
How?

633
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:19,300
Stabbed him with a bayonet. He bled well.

634
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,800
-Did you kill him?
-You bet

635
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:24,800
It's the same here.
Egg head better leave me alone.

636
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:26,300
Mathieu is not the worst.

637
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,800
Are you kidding?
Singing you a lullaby,

638
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:33,000
Then when you sleep he will come and touch you.
This type must all be killed.

639
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,500
Good evening, gentlemen

640
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:43,000
-Have a good appetite!
-I swear I didn't do anything, sir!

641
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:46,300
I see you have high-class friends, Corbin

642
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:49,500
Get out!

643
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:00,200
This feast I just witnessed will be our secret.

644
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,600
Gift to you.

645
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,100
But I warn you,

646
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:07,300
Don't speak to Pepinot, don't approach him

647
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:10,600
Don't even look at him, is that clear?

648
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:17,100
A single look towards him and I'll turn
your life into a nightmare

649
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:55,600
-What are you doing here, Morange?
-Nothing, sir

650
00:45:56,500 --> 00:46:00,200
I must have heard voices - I must be tired.

651
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:06,600
Article 8 of school regulations:
students are not allowed into classrooms alone

652
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,700
If it were Mr. Rachin, you would have to
write it a 100 times for tomorrow.

653
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,700
Plus what he would tell your mother.

654
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:14,500
I don't care about my mother

655
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:17,000
-What did she do, tell me!
-I have nothing to tell you

656
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,400
Wait! I'm not finished.
You won't get off that easily.

657
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:22,400
Nothing is free here, ask Pepinot

658
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:27,000
Your problem, Morange, is
that you do things that are unlike you.

659
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:29,900
Run away, get into fights, play truant

660
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:32,000
It may amuse the others, but not me.

661
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:37,800
I won't play your little game.
From tomorrow, compulsory choir practice.

662
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:40,000
And daily music class.

663
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:41,700
Go, go to sleep

664
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:43,600
Go

665
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,700
March 3

666
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,100
He cannot know, but I am sure of it.

667
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:50,900
His voice is a miracle

668
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:53,400
The rare promise of an exceptional musical gift.

669
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:56,100
You can go now, keep quiet

670
00:46:58,100 --> 00:46:59,900
Keep quiet!

671
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:02,800
Gradually, as my choir gets better

672
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:05,300
I domesticate my new student.

673
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:28,100
Ok, take your calculus notebooks

674
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:35,400
You are the one who makes the children sing?

675
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:38,000
Yes, isr
Are you complaining?

676
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:41,000
Oh, no, on the contrary
I love music,

677
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:44,200
-I sometimes myself croon
-Do you?

678
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:56,000
Have a nice day!

679
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,100
Same to you, my dear colleague

680
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:01,900
Algebra book, page 27

681
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:36,400
Hello, madam

682
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:39,300
Pierre will come soon

683
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:41,900
-What happened?
-Everything is fine

684
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,000
How about his tooth?

685
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:45,500
It got better

686
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:48,100
Did you tell him I dropped by?

687
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:51,300
-No
-Why?

688
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,300
I preferred not to tell him.

689
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:57,300
As you know, Pierre is a sensitive child,
and talented.

690
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,600
a talent for mischief.

691
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:01,600
Not only that,

692
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:05,500
I must talk to you about it

693
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,600
Singing?  Nobody taught him?

694
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:11,300
He has a gift. It's obvious.
Something must be done.

695
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,500
Hello

696
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:17,000
I'll leave the two of you.

697
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,300
Don't hesitate to come and see me.

698
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:26,900
I didn't tell your mother you were punished,
I told here you were at the dentist. No betrayal.

699
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:52,300
-I'm told that you sing well?
-Yes

700
00:50:56,300 --> 00:51:00,500
The gentleman seems happy with you, is he kind to you?

701
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:02,900
Not bad

702
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:10,700
I brought you clean clothes,
and I made your favourite chocolate cake.

703
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,100
Are you happy?

704
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:26,200
April, the children inspire me.

705
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,600
I knew the day would come when 
my music would be played.

706
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:35,400
I'm Clement Mathieu, musician,
every night, I compose for them.

707
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:20,800
It was not good, sir?

708
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:23,800
Yes, good, it was very good.

709
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,600
You bastard!  Go!

710
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,000
What did he do?

711
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:34,200
He stole my watch.
Caught him in my bedroom.

712
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,000
Bringing him to see Rachin. "Action-Reaction"

713
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:39,600
-Where are you taking him?
-Jail! 15 days!

714
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:43,100
-Wait!
-Wait for what?

715
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,500
He is my only barytone

716
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:50,800
Mathieu!

717
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,200
-What's the matter, sir?
-I found graffiti in the...

718
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,000
Sorry, sir, just a loose shot

719
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,400
Stand aside!

720
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,300
Mathieu, Chabert,

721
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:11,200
With me

722
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:16,900
As the weeks pass, I score
new victories.

723
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:29,800
Leclerc, we are still good friends, ain't we?

724
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,700
Of course, why do you ask this?

725
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:33,900
-5 plus 3?
-53

726
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:35,800
-Are you sure?
-Of course

727
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:36,700
Thanks!

728
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:58,100
Maybe it's only an illusion, but

729
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:01,600
It seems that even our headmaster is changing

730
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:50,700
Look, Uncle Maxence

731
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:02,700
Attention, don't move

732
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:04,300
Smile

733
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:13,500
Come on, come out, Mondain!

734
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:25,100
It's finished, child

735
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:35,200
Come on!

736
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,300
Chabert, I just met Mr Rachin

737
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:46,800
To tell him that Mathieu's choir is fantastic

738
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:49,300
-I'm tired
-But you are alawys so tired, alright 29!

739
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:50,900
And what was his answer?

740
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:53,300
Get the hell out is what he told me.

741
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:56,300
Where is Mondain?

742
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:00,400
Didn't you notice he was missing before the run?

743
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,200
He was at roll call this morning, Headmaster

744
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:03,700
After that, he...

745
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:06,000
Good, in this case, I forbid
all outside walks until the end of the year.

746
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,800
-Did he take much money?
-All the money, around 200 thousands francs

747
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:12,300
How do I pay suppliers now? How?

748
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,100
I should never have accepted him in here.

749
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:16,300
All this for a damn experiment !

750
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:19,200
Just like you, with your music

751
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:27,000
I needed coal delivered for hot water, it will be next week.
I call the police.

752
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:32,800
What's the matter?

753
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:50,300
I observe that singing makes them smarter, Mathieu

754
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,000
They make great progress

755
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:54,700
Headmaster, children have had 
no warm water for three weeks

756
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:57,400
Cold water is good for blood circulation.

757
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:01,400
By the way, Mathieu

758
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:03,300
No more choir.

759
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:07,500
-But, Headmaster
-Thanks, Mr. Mathieu

760
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Police station, please

761
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,700
I don't know yet about the choir

762
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:22,100
But for the kids, we can use wood.

763
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:24,300
We have no firewood at all!

764
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:32,900
Headmaster's personal storage

765
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,600
Chabert,"Action"-"Reaction"

766
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,100
Chabert surprised me

767
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:40,300
I thought he was Rachin's clone

768
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:46,600
He actually is a nice man, who believes sports and music
are the cements of our society.

769
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:51,800
With his help, I organize resistance

770
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:54,200
Our choir becomes a clandestine affair.

771
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:19,900
No, you always let up at the end of the sentence

772
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:24,000
I'm asking one last time to detach
every note clearly.

773
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:26,600
It's late, we'll work on this tomorrow

774
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:28,500
We are not doing the second part, sir?

775
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:30,100
I didn't teach you the solo part

776
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:31,900
But I learnt it.

777
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:34,200
You did?

778
00:59:35,201 --> 00:59:38,201
Ok, let's begin

779
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:21,300
Come on, come out

780
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:26,400
May 13th, 3pm, Mondain is back

781
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:41,400
-Where is the money?
-I don't know

782
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:44,200
-Who stole it?
-I don't know, not me

783
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:48,800
What's happening?

784
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:50,400
He is beating him?

785
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:51,800
For half an hour

786
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:53,200
Is he mad?

787
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:55,300
He is wasting his time, the child
won't say anything at all

788
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:02,400
Ok, let's start from the beginning

789
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:05,800
Where is the money?

790
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:07,500
Tell me!

791
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:11,400
Where is the money?

792
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:15,900
Let go!

793
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:18,300
Let go!

794
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:22,500
Calm down!

795
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:24,400
Calm down!

796
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:28,500
The child has just confessed,
I'll call back the police.

797
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:34,400
You will get to know another residence, with
other wardens and bars.

798
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:58,600
To avoid depressing the children,
we did not tell them about the Mondain affair.

799
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:04,000
We told them he was sent back to his original school.
End of story.

800
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
A hen

801
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:10,100
Lays 84 eggs

802
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:15,000
every year

803
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:22,100
Well fed, with good housing,

804
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:27,400
Ventilation and sanitation,

805
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:32,400
It will lay 150 eggs

806
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:38,500
How many more eggs can a farm girl obtain

807
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:44,800
if she owns 9 hens?

808
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:00,700
Nice day?

809
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:04,900
It's good to have a bit of sun.

810
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:07,300
Summer days are coming.

811
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:12,400
You know, Pierre surprises me everyday a bit more

812
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:14,400
Anyway, I..

813
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:16,500
I wanted to thank you for what you do for him.

814
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:19,200
I do it for you as well

815
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:23,200
I mean, if Pierre is good,
so will you be...

816
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:29,700
-Let me wipe it
-It's ok, it's ok

817
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:34,600
-Just ink, nevermind
-You are too much!  Idiot!

818
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:38,500
What's the matter?   Oh!

819
01:03:39,100 --> 01:03:41,200
Why do you beat him?

820
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:43,600
Tell me, Bebert

821
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:46,200
Because he threw ink at you

822
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Can't you shut up?

823
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:52,400
Pierre, I'm ashamed of you.

824
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:59,200
Wait! It's ok!

825
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:02,600
You have to understand,
It's because he is proud of you and you are pretty

826
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:04,000
Pretty?

827
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:07,000
I mean, you are unusual comparing with
other children's mother

828
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:09,000
Do you mean that I'm alone?

829
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:10,900
Me too.

830
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:13,200
-But you have no children
-No

831
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:15,200
I have sixty

832
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:18,400
But when they see you, they see the
lady of their dreams

833
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:21,600
I mean, the mother they all dreamt about

834
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:24,500
It's not a dream for Pierre, you are his mother

835
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:27,200
Like all other children,
he doesn't want to share with others

836
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:30,500
We must get him out of this boarding school where he's 
wasting his time and send him to music school.

837
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:33,600
I'd like him to have a real job.

838
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:35,400
Music is a true career

839
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:38,700
Provided one has solid grounding.
He could go to Lyons Institute of Music,

840
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,900
I'd keep an eye on him so he does not stray.

841
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:44,500
Even there, you can get a bad teacher

842
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:49,800
-And then?
-Then, he will become whatever he must.

843
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:52,100
Alone we can't do anything.

844
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:55,000
Pierre is an exception. I will do everything in my power
so that his talent can bloom.

845
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:59,700
- But it need your help, too
- I see, thanks

846
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,900
No, no! What's the matter, today? Are you all sleepy?

847
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:30,000
And you, Boniface, how do you stand?

848
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:32,500
Do you think we can sing like this?
Stand straight!

849
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:36,400
Ok, again, start from "So gentle..."

850
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:11,700
Where is my solo?

851
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:12,900
What solo?

852
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,200
My solo!

853
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:16,600
Ah, yes, your solo, no, no solo any more

854
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:19,100
You have a decent voice,
but no one is indispensible.

855
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:21,100
You sing or not.  It does not matter to me.

856
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,900
We can do without you. Listen.

857
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:26,700
Listen, we start...

858
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:31,500
We start from "Oh, night"

859
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:53,600
Mathieu!

860
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:57,100
-You're gonna get a scolding...
-I thought he had gone to town?

861
01:06:57,300 --> 01:06:59,800
Dismissed. Go play outside.

862
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:10,200
You are a pain, do you know that?

863
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:13,000
Headmaster, I promise you,
homework is finished

864
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,500
Our charity committee heard of your choir

865
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:18,300
The countess herself writes to me

866
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:21,200
She and her friends are visiting next sunday
They want to listen

867
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:22,600
It's great!

868
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:24,100
I mean, it's good

869
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:28,700
I already see the scene. Simpering,
music, why not petit fours since we're at it!

870
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:31,900
You give me extra work with all these silly
things of yours!

871
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:34,900
But, Headmaster, you will notice

872
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,800
that Music has not relaxed discipline.

873
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,500
We have had less problems for quite some time.

874
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:39,500
Coincidence

875
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:41,200
I don't believe in coincidences, Headmaster

876
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:45,200
It looks that way. Who apart from you
would tell the foundation about the choir?

877
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:46,500
It's me

878
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:50,800
Do you know how to write?

879
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:54,000
-Uncle Maxence probably thought he was doing a good thing.
-Spare me your explanations

880
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:55,800
I don't like your ways, Mathieu

881
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
I think you don't like much, Headmaster

882
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:00,500
Mr. Rachin, someone for you 
in the guest room!

883
01:08:02,900 --> 01:08:05,100
Let's talk about this later

884
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:09,200
It's for you

885
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:13,400
Sometimes I think we should have let
Mondain strangle him.

886
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:19,900
Violette was thanking me for what I was doing for her son.

887
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,600
She wanted to talk to me about it privately

888
01:08:21,700 --> 01:08:24,100
And tell me something important.

889
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:28,000
Rendez-vous at Square Cafe, 20th, 4pm

890
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,900
I wrote a letter to the Lyons Institute of Music

891
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:32,500
I know the principal there

892
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:34,200
He kindly answered

893
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:37,800
he would be glad to audition your son,
and in case he is admitted,

894
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:41,600
He would help him get a scolarship.

895
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:45,800
-Things will be easier on that front from now on.
-Is that so?

896
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:49,000
After I met you,

897
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:53,300
My...my life...

898
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:55,800
How to say?

899
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:59,300
-Change totally?
-Exactly!

900
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:02,100
It's all thanks to you

901
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:03,700
I could not imagine...

902
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:06,300
Same here. I had lost hope...

903
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:10,800
I'm thinking, maybe I'm wrong to go too fast.

904
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:13,400
Ah, no, trust me, no problem

905
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,500
It's true that you brought me luck.

906
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:18,400
Luck?

907
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:24,400
I met someone,

908
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:28,100
He is an eningeer from Lyons

909
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:30,800
I met him at the cafe.

910
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:33,500
He works around here on a bridge project.

911
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,400
Are you ok?

912
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:43,400
Fine

913
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:47,600
It's a great opportunity, for you and Pierre.

914
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:51,500
Don't get upset. I have to run.

915
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:54,300
I'm love for the three of us to have
lunch together one of these days.

916
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:58,400
You will tell him about Pierre? Please?

917
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:01,100
Why not

918
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:05,000
Ok, goodbye

919
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:06,700
Goodbye

920
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:12,900
Thanks for all you've done

921
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:18,400
Oh, not a word to Pierre for the time being.

922
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:34,800
Sorry, may I take the chair?

923
01:10:34,900 --> 01:10:37,700
-Of course
-Thanks

924
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:02,200
Countess, I... glad... flowers.

925
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:05,700
I did not catch everything,
but I get the intention.

926
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,200
Thank you, my child

927
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:11,500
Countess, please allow me to introduce you to Mr. Mathieu,

928
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:14,700
Our prefect, who makes our dear children sing.

929
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,400
Countess

930
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:18,100
Please accept my compliments, sir,

931
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:22,400
We follow with great interest the humane and sensitive
teaching methods of Mr Rachin.

932
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:25,000
We thank you for your contribution
to these methods.

933
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:28,300
By the way, who came up with the idea for the choir?...

934
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:32,400
-Well...
-Mine, Countess, my idea

935
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:37,000
It is a great pleasure, Countess, to help
such an understanding director.

936
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:39,600
Alright. Make them sing.

937
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:45,500
-Mr. Rachin is modest, he doesn't like praise
-That's right

938
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:49,300
What will you sing, then?

939
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:51,200
La Nuit, by Rameau, Countess

940
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:53,600
That must be beautiful

941
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:00,300
Excuse me, who is the boy standing aside?

942
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:02,000
Is he being punished?

943
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:06,100
That boy?  He is an exception

944
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:08,400
May I begin?

945
01:15:37,401 --> 01:15:40,401
And in the eyes of Morange,
who was following my rythm so well,

946
01:15:40,402 --> 01:15:45,602
I read many things. Pride,
happiness to be forgiven

947
01:15:45,603 --> 01:15:50,603
but also something new for him,
gratefulness.

948
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:54,300
First day of summer

949
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:56,300
Our choir welcomes a new member

950
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:02,900
Sorry, I missed the link. My mistake.

951
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:06,200
Go ahead.

952
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:01,300
Come here, it's important

953
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:05,800
I was scrubbing the toilet walls to
remove graffitis.

954
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,700
I lifted a tile and found this

955
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:11,900
-It's Corbin's harmonica
-And this

956
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:14,400
At least 200 thousands francs inside

957
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:25,500
No one knew where your cache was.

958
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:29,400
Don't tell me you don't know how
the money got there.

959
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:32,900
Do you know Mondain was expelled
because he was accused of the theft?

960
01:17:33,700 --> 01:17:35,700
I didn't know

961
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,700
It's true - You did not know.

962
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,600
Now I've told you

963
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:42,900
What got into you?
What were you gonna do with the money?

964
01:17:43,900 --> 01:17:46,400
If I tell you, you won't repeat?

965
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:48,200
No

966
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:49,800
I swear

967
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:54,000
I wanted to buy...

968
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:56,200
Buy what?

969
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:58,600
A hot air balloon

970
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,500
We don't know who stole the money,
but it proves that Mondain is innocent

971
01:18:02,700 --> 01:18:04,900
He would never have left without the money.
That's obvious.

972
01:18:05,100 --> 01:18:06,900
We will look into it in 2 days time, after I come back.

973
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:09,500
Mathieu, don't worry too much.

974
01:18:09,700 --> 01:18:11,700
If Mondain is not guilty this time, he would
have been another time anyway.

975
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:13,800
Nothing can be done for such people, nothing.

976
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,800
-How about justice?
-He's in the hands of justice now.

977
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,500
Headmaster, wait for me!

978
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:20,800
-Wait for me!
-Are you leaving too?

979
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,400
I am catching a ride.
I am spending my vacation at my sister's.

980
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:29,000
There is a piano there

981
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,100
Do you know why Rachin goes to Lyons?

982
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:43,300
I think he needs to discuss the budget with the committee.

983
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:46,400
-Doesn't he?
-Yes

984
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:50,300
But actually, his main purpose is to kiss ass
for promotion and a medal.

985
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:52,900
Do you think he will succeed?

986
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:57,300
Crafty as he is?
He will present an idyllic picture of the school,

987
01:18:57,500 --> 01:19:03,400
Hide the terrible things you know,
and take credit for the choir's success.

988
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:07,600
-Success?
-I've heard it, it's very good.

989
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:11,200
Sir, is it true Langlois and the principal
left together?

990
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:15,200
Yes, Chabert and Carpentier took two weeks,
We are masters of the place.

991
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:17,400
Then there is no course today?

992
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:19,500
No

993
01:19:19,700 --> 01:19:22,500
-What shall we do?
-Take a nap

994
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:26,000
No, I have a better idea

995
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,500
Excuse me, you...

996
01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:36,900
-Your medal?
-Yes

997
01:19:37,900 --> 01:19:40,000
The bird is in the nest, Mr. Rachin

998
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,100
I don't know how to thank you

999
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:49,900
Headmaster, call for you...

1000
01:19:54,900 --> 01:19:56,600
Excuse me, I...

1001
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:20,100
The fire started from the roof.

1002
01:20:20,300 --> 01:20:24,700
The blaze was eating up the sleeping quarters,
where the kids were last seen.

1003
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:28,300
Sixty children killed, trapped like rats.

1004
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:29,500
To Rachin

1005
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:33,400
His promotion and medal are going up in flames
right in front of him.

1006
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:35,400
But suddenly...

1007
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:26,100
After lunch, we got out by the back door
near the vegetable garden.

1008
01:21:26,300 --> 01:21:29,000
So that Mary and the villagers would not see us, then

1009
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:31,200
We went to the Lignon forest

1010
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:34,200
Why did you go there?

1011
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:36,900
We did an orientation game.
The kids loved it.

1012
01:21:40,700 --> 01:21:43,500
Suffice to say, uncle Maxence,
I'm extremely disappointed by your behaviour.

1013
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:47,600
Headmaster, I assume the entire responsibility for this escapade.

1014
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:50,400
Uncle Maxence never stopped trying to talk me out of it.

1015
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,600
That's what I call a lack of conviction.

1016
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:56,300
On the other hand, one could say we saved the children's lives.

1017
01:21:56,500 --> 01:21:59,700
Well, if you had not left the school unattended,
there would have been no fire!

1018
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:03,400
I don't know why I'm still listening to you.

1019
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:05,800
Ok, uncle Maxence, considering your seniority,

1020
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,400
you will only suffer a suspension.

1021
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:10,900
As for you, Mr. Mathieu, you are fired

1022
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:12,900
for breaking the school rules.

1023
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:15,300
If that's what you want, then fire me too!

1024
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:17,100
It's not for you to decide.

1025
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:20,900
Mr. Maxence, thanks for your kindness
But I believe children need you very much

1026
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:25,600
Think about the children,
since this gentleman never does.

1027
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:29,800
This is your due, here you are

1028
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,500
You leave immediately by the 6pm bus.

1029
01:22:32,700 --> 01:22:36,500
-I forbid you to see a single one of you pupils.
-What do you mean?

1030
01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:39,900
Uncle Maxence, make sure of it.

1031
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:49,600
Headmaster, before we part,
let me tell you what I think of you

1032
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:51,100
I know, Mathieu

1033
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:54,600
-You are incompetent, cruel.
-What about them

1034
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:56,800
-They didn't choose to be here
-Neither did I

1035
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
I never wanted to be an educator.

1036
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:01,400
And don't tell me you were dreaming
of burying yourself in this god forsaken place.

1037
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:02,900
You had other ambitions. Me too.

1038
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:07,500
-You should not take out your failure on the children.
-You think I enjoy playing prison warden?

1039
01:23:07,700 --> 01:23:09,300
Someone must do it.

1040
01:23:09,300 --> 01:23:11,200
But go ahead, go to Paris

1041
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:13,000
Go knock on the minister's door

1042
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:16,300
Hello!  I'm Mathieu, we must use true educators
not half wits.

1043
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:21,000
Get in, fight, since you have faith!
Mathieu! Saint Mathieu!

1044
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:24,300
You're a failed musician, a prefect

1045
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,600
Just a small prefect,

1046
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:30,600
What do you do in life, Mr Mathieu? I'm a prefect, 
prefect, prefect, prefect, prefect!

1047
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:35,100
You are a madman

1048
01:23:35,300 --> 01:23:38,400
I'm so tired, go to hell

1049
01:23:38,900 --> 01:23:41,400
On the contrary, I'm leaving it

1050
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:58,100
I had hoped some children would brave the interdiction
and come say goodbye, but nothing.

1051
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:03,200
These children's wisdom resembled indifference.

1052
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,500
And Morange, anyway...

1053
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:41,400
On the first piece of paper,
I see Boniface exquisite handwriting

1054
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:44,700
And the one with wrong spelling, should be Pepinot's

1055
01:24:44,900 --> 01:24:48,700
And the one with music notes, that's Morange.

1056
01:24:49,100 --> 01:24:53,000
And this one, that one

1057
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:17,600
Make them stop!

1058
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:20,000
-They've  locked the door

1059
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:26,500
At that time, I felt a surge of happiness
and optimism.

1060
01:25:26,700 --> 01:25:29,200
I wanted to tell the whole world.

1061
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:31,100
But who would have listened?

1062
01:25:31,300 --> 01:25:33,800
No one knows who I am

1063
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:37,400
The great artist would soon crash back to earth.

1064
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:43,100
I'm Clement Mathieu, a failed musician,
unemployed prefect

1065
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:49,300
I'm Clement Mathieu, a failed musician,
unemployed prefect

1066
01:26:02,700 --> 01:26:04,300
After that?

1067
01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:07,500
He never got around to writing it.

1068
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:13,100
But I, I can tell you

1069
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:19,400
And Pepinot told me.
The next day, on my road back to school

1070
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:23,000
My childhood memories came back to me.

1071
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,600
After Mathieu was fired, my mother took me back.

1072
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:30,900
We went to Lyons, where I was admitted to the Music School.

1073
01:26:31,900 --> 01:26:35,000
Engineer wanted me to be a boarder again,
My mother refused

1074
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:37,200
And he left us

1075
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:40,800
Chabert, Langlois and uncle Maxence united

1076
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,300
And denounced Rachin's abusive methods towards the students

1077
01:26:43,900 --> 01:26:47,400
Children were questioned, Rachin fired.

1078
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:55,900
Clement Mathieu continued to teach music
untill he passed away

1079
01:26:56,300 --> 01:26:58,500
He never tried to be famous

1080
01:26:58,700 --> 01:27:02,200
All he did, he kept to himself.

1081
01:27:02,700 --> 01:27:05,900
To him? No, not entirely

1082
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:12,500
Mr. Mathieu!

1083
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:16,000
Wait for me

1084
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,500
Mr. Mathieu!

1085
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:26,800
Why are you here?

1086
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,600
Could you please take me with you?

1087
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:32,000
Oh, I can't do that

1088
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:34,500
You must go back to school,
otherwise you will be punished

1089
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:36,400
-Please
-Shall we go?

1090
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:38,100
Be right back

1091
01:27:38,300 --> 01:27:41,100
I cannot take you away

1092
01:27:41,300 --> 01:27:42,600
Go back

1093
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:44,100
Go

1094
01:27:44,500 --> 01:27:46,100
Go

1095
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:12,700
Pepinot was right to believe in it.

1096
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:16,700
The day Mathieu was fired was a Saturday

1097
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:21,200
To Violette
