00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,830
<i>Timing and Subtitles Created by The Royal Minions @ Viki </i>

2
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:21,140
Run!

3
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:13,830
<i> I first met him at age 12. </i>

4
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:18,660
<i> He was by himself. </i>

5
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:23,320
<i>- Who are you? <br>- I am Wang Rin, the third son of Susagong, who lives in Jeongseungdong.</i>

6
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,990
<i>Jeongseungdong?</i>

7
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,070
Yes.

8
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,240
<i>Are there common folk there?</i>

9
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:53,370
This is the Nam Dae area. It's also the largest marketplace around.

10
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:54,850
Oh I know.

11
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:56,810
Have you been here before?

12
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:59,580
I've heard of it before.

13
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,970
Look over there,

14
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,860
<i>That's taffy, right? </i>

15
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,520
- Should I buy you it? <br> - Buy it?

16
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,550
If you want to eat it, you have to buy it.

17
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:19,050
I will do it.

18
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:25,810
I like you following me. You can call me by my name and be informal.

19
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:28,620
My name is Won.

20
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,430
Your Highness.

21
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:32,010
<i>From now on, you are now my friend.</i>

22
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:35,470
<i>Treat me as a friend. It is a command.</i>

23
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,680
<i>He is a lonely person. Treat him as a friend.</i>

24
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,920
Yes.

25
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,850
<i>But... don't try to become a friend.</i>

26
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,630
<i>The Crown Prince is to become King, who cannot have friends.</i>

27
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:58,220
<i> I didn't understand my father's words back then. </i>

28
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:05,370
<i>How could one give just a portion of their heart?</i>

29
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:26,090
<i>♫ You are living and breathing within me ♫</i>

30
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:28,550
Your highness.

31
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:32,040
Are you okay?

32
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,360
Let's go together.

33
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:44,090
<i>♫ Walk towards me ♫</i>

34
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,710
So he hid the wine up there?

35
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,200
Yes.

36
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,290
So that he could drink it sparingly?

37
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:51,820
Just like that.

38
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:56,130
Your teacher is not in the right mind.

39
00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:00,060
That, I agree with.

40
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:18,400
<i>♫ I miss you ♫</i>

41
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:49,480
It's just one cup. Just one cup.

42
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,910
Mhm.

43
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:54,370
Go ahead inside. Let's get out of the rain first.

44
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:04,250
Go inside first. I'll find stuff to light a fire.

45
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,500
Do you really not know that kid?

46
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,220
I'm not sure.

47
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:12,990
You you remember when Minister Eun's Madam was attacked?

48
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:13,770
Yes.

49
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:17,860
She is the handmaid we met in that house.

50
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:22,850
I guess it's weird to actually remember and recognize a handmaid from a short meeting 7 years ago.

51
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:26,710
My memory is unnecessarily sharp.

52
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:29,630
- I'll be going inside first. <br> - Yes.

53
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:04,280
<i>Stay here. I'll go in and look around inside first.</i>

54
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:09,170
<i>Dong Bae Ajussi!</i>

55
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:12,870
<i>Man Ho Ajussi...</i>

56
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:18,540
<i>Bo Sung Ajussi and Jae Chan Ajussi...</i>

57
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:23,820
I'm not hurt at all.

58
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:30,290
Since you guys risked your lives for me, I'm not scratched anywhere.

59
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:41,150
Thank you.

60
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:45,070
I'm sorry.

61
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,420
Rest in peace.

62
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:57,590
<i> I saw her first. The kid was crying. </i>

63
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:15,370
<i>You're that handmaid, the one who was the only one to survive alongside the daughter.</i>

64
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,940
<i>Tell me.</i>

65
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:21,090
<i>What were you doing there?</i>

66
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,950
<i>The mother said this,</i>

67
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,880
<i>"Do not hate anyone.</i>

68
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,580
<i>Always smile, as you always do, and live your life running.</i>

69
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,780
<i>That is your mother's wish."</i>

70
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:47,220
<i>I saw her first.</i>

71
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:51,920
<i>I wanted to hold her hand first.</i>

72
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,990
Geez...

73
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:08,860
Were you born dumb, or did you become dumb over time

74
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:13,180
and find it too hard to tell men apart after spending a lot of time with men?

75
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:16,220
How can you not recognize me?

76
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:19,620
Gosh, what are you talking about?

77
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,580
You lived in Janghadong in the capital 7 years ago, right?

78
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:25,960
Wow! He has so much wine stored up here!

79
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,230
How did he even move this up here?

80
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:32,160
Moon Bae wine, Arabian wine,

81
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:36,880
Hey! I found it, it's the Snow Dew wine!

82
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,240
Just this one pot ful?

83
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,060
I guess so, just the one.

84
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:48,890
It makes sense that he was so devastated at the loss, I guess.

85
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:50,730
Gosh, it's so cold.

86
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,320
You're frozen blue there. Are you okay?

87
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,830
Don't speak to me because heat will escape.

88
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,120
Are you alright?

89
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:06,120
I'm just about to freeze to death, just about to.

90
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,220
Come now,

91
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:18,690
we're all cold. You don't have to–

92
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,470
Will the wood catch fire when its all wet?

93
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,270
The rain st-

94
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,570
...stopped.

95
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:36,870
I tried to collect drier wood so if we try to light it well...

96
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:41,650
Let's open up that pot of Arabian wine. We have to heat up our bodies somehow.

97
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:44,090
Is it okay when it's the teacher's wine?

98
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:51,760
He'll have a harder time cleaning our dead bodies after we freeze to death. It's better for him that we just drink up that one pot.

99
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:32,610
How is it? Is your body feeling hot?

100
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,630
It's incredible.

101
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:40,540
It doesn't taste like the alcohol we're familiar with. Try it.

102
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,650
Hey, you two.

103
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:55,990
- Two what?<br>- Your relationship is a tad different from just friendship the way I see it...

104
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:59,500
- It's not what you think!<br>- Not what?

105
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:04,440
- What is this child saying right now?<br>- What are you trying to say?

106
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:10,380
No matter how I see it, you two... seem strangely...

107
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:14,640
Don't even think about it. We're not.

108
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,430
I'm hungry.

109
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,990
For some reason, I feel like I'm doing a disloyal deed.

110
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,780
I agree.

111
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:40,030
As far as I know, His Highness' food was left behind with his horse,

112
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:43,000
and the woman's bag fell off the cliff.

113
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,170
- Then don't tell me...<br>- They're probably starving right now.

114
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:51,000
Do you really have an appetite knowing that?

115
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:55,470
- I guess I do.<br>- Disloyalty.<br>- Indeed.

116
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:02,910
Wh-what?

117
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:14,240
The Crown Prince went to see Teacher Lee Seung Hyoo?

118
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,810
It would be a shame just knowing that myself.

119
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:22,210
If it's Teacher Lee Seung Hyoo, you mean the man that loves alcohol?

120
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:26,280
He's a sly fox who wishes to take the appearance of a drunkard.

121
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,140
I heard that he was in exile for angering the King.

122
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:32,550
It wasn't that he merely angered him.

123
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:42,720
So I've heard. The King was so mad that he threw his wooden pillow at him

124
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:48,520
and even with blood dripping from an open wound on his forehead - he continued to call out the King's faults?

125
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:53,290
Even as he was being dragged out by armed men, "my King your foolishness is this"

126
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:59,450
"my King your reign is like that" on and on.

127
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:04,410
Why would the Crown Prince want to go see a man like him?

128
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:07,690
The Crown Prince's intent in going there is not important .

129
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:14,290
Those who will predict his intent, and talk about his intent will begin thinking long and hard.

130
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:23,150
What are you standing so far away?

131
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:26,740
- I miss you.<br>- Then come closer.

132
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,900
I want to savor every moment.

133
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:45,490
How do you stand it?

134
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:50,560
The overflowing foolishness of the people of this world,

135
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:56,440
even those who call themselves...royalty.

136
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:02,160
Hush...I see you're dangerous.

137
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:20,390
Seven days last month,, nine days the one before, and 14 days the one before that...

138
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:25,990
this is the number of days the Crown Prince was absent from his quarters you say?

139
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,030
I'm sorry to bear this news.

140
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:32,700
The Crown Prince is someone who will take the throne one day and reign over Goryeo's people-

141
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:36,980
I know what the Crown Prince is.

142
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:41,740
I, Minister Song, dare to make a plea.

143
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:45,520
- Go ahead.<br>- For great Goryeo,

144
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:49,060
dethrone the Crown Prince.

145
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:58,720
If the grandson of great Yuan becomes the king of Goryeo, what exactly comes of Goryeo?

146
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:04,840
What if the Crown Prince simply handed over Goryeo to Yuan - what then?

147
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,890
Minister! You go too far!

148
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:11,510
Look here! Those are not my words! This is what the people are saying!

149
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:18,540
Words of the people are most dangerous when the listener only hears what they wish to hear!

150
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,620
- Therefore,<br>- Therefore?

151
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,040
What have you heard then?

152
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:28,220
The Crown Prince has always enjoyed wandering out undercover,

153
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:32,280
and as far as I know it was purely to better understand the lives of the people.

154
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,560
- Also,<br>- Also?

155
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:39,500
After he has learned about the people, he wishes to preach at his ignorant father?

156
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:45,270
- Your Highness!<br>- You yourself have seen it too. The way the Prince seeks to teach me.

157
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:51,830
He's even said this before. "How is it Father,

158
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:56,690
that you distance yourself from your servants who offer loyal advice, and only keep close the sycophants?"

159
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,820
Let's see here. Who are the loyal servants and who are the disloyal servants among you?

160
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:06,630
Please withdraw your words your highness!

161
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:09,390
Should I ask the Crown Prince directly?

162
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:11,360
Okay then, bring him in.

163
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,500
Your Highness...I apologize for bearing this news,

164
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:22,760
Since yesterday, His Highness... has been missing.

165
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:31,400
Bring the Crown Prince to me.

166
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,060
Immediately!

167
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:36,820
The King has even called together armed men.

168
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:42,760
Is he going to hunt at this hour?

169
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,670
I think it is because of the Crown Prince!

170
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:52,550
I hear that in the court meeting, they discussed the Prince's dethronement yet again.

171
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:58,460
Therefore, the King summoned the Crown Prince..but he wasn't in his quarters.

172
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:05,260
The servants of the quarters reported to the King that the Prince went out undercover to the Nam Dae area.

173
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:19,650
Your highness, you've arrived!

174
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,620
Where is the Crown Prince?

175
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,060
He left undercover for the Nam Dae area,

176
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:01,090
If he indeed went to the Nam Dae area it is within the protection of the palace men,

177
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:05,580
there is no way he would have sent armed men.

178
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,030
Where is the Prince?

179
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:13,550
He went to the Doo Ta mountains.

180
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:27,890
At the Doo Ta mountains there is the Moo Ryeng valley

181
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:32,490
but he left all that behind and went to the School of the Dragon Eye?

182
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:33,960
Yes, he did.

183
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,890
Why would that be?

184
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,520
By Lee Seung Hyo...

185
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:53,350
you mean official that was dismissed for speaking his mind in front of the King?

186
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:59,060
The one who because of his words to the king, is being praised and treasured by the people?

187
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:06,390
He must think that if he bring Lee Seung Hyo to his side, the scholars who follow Lee would all take his side too.

188
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:08,840
The Crown Prince meet someone like him?

189
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,890
Discreetly at that?

190
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:19,070
Not the Moo Reung Valley or the Fifty Rivers...

191
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:25,400
The Crown Prince must

192
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:29,820
be in Lee Seung Hyoo's house.

193
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:38,560
If it becomes known that the Crown Prince met with Lee Sung Hyo, he will be accused of treason.

194
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:48,540
Use all means. You can light Lee Seung Hyo's house on fire, and you can tie the Prince up and drag him here.

195
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:51,590
Bring back the Crown Prince.

196
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,220
From THAT house.

197
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:58,370
Use all means to get their before the King's men.

198
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:02,670
We must make it so the Prince never set foot in the Doo Ta mountains.

199
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:10,560
Look at her, after drinking a whole jar of alcohol away.

200
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:26,720
She wouldn't know if someone piggybacked her away.

201
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:44,850
But is she naive or bold?

202
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:49,330
How could she sleep with two men around?

203
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:54,360
- Are you sure she's really sleeping?<br>- I'm sure, look.

204
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:59,160

208
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,380
Her face is cold.

209
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:24,260
It's not your hand that's warm?

210
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:27,720
It's cold. Would it be okay for her to sleep like this?

211
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:35,230
Falling asleep with a lowered body temperature is not a good thing.

Okay.

219
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:15,790
Closer!

220
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:22,330

Sorry?

224
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:35,630
She still looks strange.

227
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,060
There she is!

228
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,820
What took you so long?!

229
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,160
Brother, I knew you would wait for me.

230
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,260
You really did it! I knew you could do it!

231
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:32,790
Let's hurry go in. And who are you guys?

232
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:37,020
They wanted to offer a glass to him too. I owe them as well.

233
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,510
That won't do.

234
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:40,170
What?

235
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:44,460
He only receives one cup, never two.

236
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:55,840
It's because I'm not in a place where I can come back. I beg you. Just this once...

237
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,530
Sister!

238
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:01,800
I must go to Gaegyeong (the capital).

239
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,770
The anniversary of Madam's death is not too far away.

240
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:07,410
But what about the Gyeokgoo games?

241
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:09,750
I'm off to Gaegyeong.

242
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:13,870
Make yourself comfortable and enjoy the rest of the Gyeokgoo games.

243
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,910
What are you doing?

244
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,930
There must be a reason for your generosity.

245
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,660
- The Master's breakfast is getting cold. <br>- I'll compensate you!

246
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:30,230
Fix that habit of yours! Stop putting a price on everything.

247
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:33,330
It's because I feel uncomfortable...

248
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:47,650
In the Nam Dae area of the capital, there is a tavern run by Maid Ahn.

249
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:52,010
That place has the best Arabian wine. On me?

250
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:21,130
Stop!

251
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,570
I will ask my question.

252
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,880
Go for it.

253
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:45,270
My family raises a flock of sheep with the help of some sheep dogs.

254
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:50,160
But one day, a wolf came and had a cub with one of the sheep dogs.

255
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,390
A wolf-dog then huh?

256
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:56,830
Will the wolf-dog follow the the shepherd dog's footsteps and be a good shepherd dog?

257
00:25:56,830 --> 00:26:02,060
How would I know? It's up to the wolf-dog to choose.

258
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:05,470
- There is a problem.<br>- A problem?

259
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:07,620
The flock of sheep are scared of the wolf-dog.

260
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,610
Of course they are.

261
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:12,660
What should be done to the wolf-dog?

262
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:15,580
Kick it out?

263
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,340
Or...due to the fear of the future...

264
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,420
kill it?

265
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:40,180
This way.

266
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:45,190
We were told to escort the Prince out immediately.

267
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:54,510
There's a problem sister!

268
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,660
Tell us who you're looking for first.

269
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:08,050
We're here on the King's orders. Step aside.

270
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:11,960
You said your name was Han Cheon?

271
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:14,170
Yes.

272
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:18,640
In front of that name...do you perhaps add the character "un" for "speech"?<br> (Un = 言)

273
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:25,720
The origin of the Khans. Yuan (阮)

274
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,460
Yuan meaning "endless" (遠)

275
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:34,280
You must be thinking further than you should be.

276
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:37,430
You wish to boast to me that you used an analogy

277
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:40,130
to try and predict the political trend of the future?

278
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:45,540
I've seen you before, a long time ago.

279
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,230
You still you the same, but you've grown up well.

280
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:13,480
Have you been well your highness.

281
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:31,290
He's not here.

282
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:33,780
Excuse me!

283
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:39,690
Are you perhaps looking for people that came to see the teacher?

284
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:42,070
I heard they came from Gaegyeong.

285
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,920
Where are they?

286
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,860
This way.

287
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,400
He's here sharing a discreet discussion with our teacher.

288
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:03,630
They won't let anyone join in. Just them two...

289
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:25,000
What a scare! Who are you guys?

290
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,830
The Crown Pr-

291
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:43,880
The Crown Prince!

292
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:47,620
Open the door.

293
00:29:56,770 --> 00:30:00,670
Father

294
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:06,000
I heard your summons and ran over.

295
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:12,250
I called for you yesterday.

296
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:17,210
And yet...you show up late afternoon the next day?

297
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:20,660
Who knew the sun rises so early?

298
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:24,170
Alright. What have you been doing?

299
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:26,630
You son,

300
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:31,720
was out undercover to better understand

301
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:37,660
the hardship of the people. Undercover.

302
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:04,640
You who can't even sit up straight in broad daylight because you're drunk,

303
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,470
go undercover into the city?

304
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:08,910
Well...

305
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:13,290
Forgive me, Father.

306
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,590
If you were less smarter,

307
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,700
if you were even a tiny bit dull,

308
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:36,780
you would have died.

309
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:41,370
My...son.

310
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:49,540
Escort the Prince away. Open the windows and air out the stench of the alcohol.

311
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:52,360
Yes, Your Majesty.

312
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:57,670
Your Highness.

313
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:36,300
How dare you take the Crown Prince there?

314
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:40,050
You don't think I know your true intentions?

315
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:42,870
You probably hoped the Crown Prince would be captured there.

316
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:48,510
And your father would be the first one to jump in and say that the Crown Prince is plotting a rebellion, and that he should be dethroned?

317
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:52,870
I know your family is eyeing the Crown Prince's seat thirstily.

318
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:56,130
Well then? Are they planning on your older brother to take the Prince's place? Or is it you?!

319
00:32:56,130 --> 00:33:03,740
You...you are so enamored with the thought of becoming the Crown Prince that you hover around the Prince and charm him.

320
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:23,820
If you hurt my son, the Crown Prince, even in the slightest bit,

321
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:28,780
I will make sure to kill you first.

322
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:59,910
He's waiting.

323
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,100
Lin?

324
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:10,680
Here.

325
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,410
Have a seat.

326
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,760
What is this?

327
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,230
Put it on. Here.

328
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,490
It's not bad enough to need medicine.

329
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:23,660
Then at least pretend you're using it, for my sake.

330
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:27,860
I forced the best medicine from the royal physician himself.

331
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:33,160
Hand it over.

332
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,210
It's okay.

333
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:38,670
You don't even know where you were hurt? So clumsy.

334
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:41,660
You know my mother has no kind words to share. Why were you even standing there?

335
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:44,720
She appeared out of nowhere.

336
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:50,490
Please understand. My mother is very sensitive to you and your brother.

337
00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:52,960
It's understandable.

338
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,820
My brother's been wanting your seat for a long time.

339
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:59,770
It's not even fun being the Crown Prince.

340
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:02,530
I should've just given it to him.

341
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:08,570
Your brother will be the Crown Prince and I'll be the Tiara Prince or the Hairpin Prince!

342
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:11,040
That wasn't a funny joke.

343
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,430
Not funny huh?

344
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:16,880
I guess she didn't laugh either. Despite all my attempts at jokes.

345
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,320
Who?

346
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,330
We came here by horse.

347
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:23,200
And that punk went by foot, so she's probably still walking, right?

348
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:27,190
So who is walking?

349
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:36,470
It seems like that kid was kicked out from home when she was young.

350
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:39,790
Saying that she wasn't able to protect her Madam...

351
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:44,860
Wandering here and there...

352
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:48,050
And ended up in the forest somehow.

353
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:51,120
Then...

354
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:55,790
was spotted by the teacher before being starved to death and became his student.

355
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:59,130
You've been thinking of the handmaid all this time? Constantly?

356
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:03,160
I almost killed her...along with everyone else that died.

357
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:10,220
I didn't ask for help just because I wanted to have a watch,

358
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:13,420
so many people died.

359
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:18,740
It seems you have forgotten all about it...but not me.

360
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:27,410
I couldn't confess that it was me.

361
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:33,190
Since this is expensive,

362
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:36,140
I'll use it well.

363
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:38,220
Go ahead.

364
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,290
Jang Ee.

365
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:49,430
Teacher Lee's student, So Ah.

366
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:50,220
Yes.

367
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:53,280
The Crown Prince wants to meet her again.

368
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,700
- I need to find out what kind of person she is.<br>- I'll find out.

369
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:59,070
- Report back promptly.<br>- I'll send some men.

370
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:03,430
No. I'll go see her...

371
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:05,960
myself.

372
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,360
That mixed breed Prince, I don't even want to look at him.

373
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:39,920
<i>It's dangerous.</i>

374
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:46,960
<i>Hyungnim.</i>

375
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:52,950
<i>Tell the Master that the girl ran away.</i>

376
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:54,350
<i>Yes, Sir.</i>

377
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:04,860
<i>One of the thieve clearly said,</i>

378
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:10,360
<i>"tell the Master. And that Master, is you."</i>

379
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,490
<i>- Be quiet.<br>- What are you doing?</i>

380
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:18,420
<i>Were you with the Crown Prince?</i>

381
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:23,200
<i>While all those people were dying, what was the Crown Prince doing? And what about you?</i>

382
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,990
<i>I was out there risking my life!</i>

383
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:29,160
<i>We were... We were...!</i>

384
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:35,110
<i>I heard it's His Highness's hobby to enjoy watching the poor and the starving.</i>

385
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:37,140
<i>Is that true?</i>

386
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:41,690
<i>Don't be ridiculous.</i>

387
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:45,420
<i>I'll pretend like you nor the Crown Prince was ever there.</i>

388
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:49,350
<i>He's hated by everyone in the land already.</i>

389
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:53,820
<i>So you, be quiet.</i>

390
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:01,990
So Ah, the woman has arrived in the Jang Dan province.

391
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:03,350
Okay.

392
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:05,070
But...

393
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,920
the Prince has also made orders of his own.

394
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,660
I've received word that she just arrived in Jang Dan province.

395
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:13,260
If she's on her way to the capital...where would her next stop be?

396
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,570
She's probably on her way to the Jang Pae gates.

397
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:17,980
- By herself?<br> - Yes.

398
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,550
Walking such a long distance...

399
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:24,120
Should we keep following her? Or capture her?

400
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:27,860
- Why?<br>- Pardon?<br>- Capture her to do what?

401
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:37,850
Your highness, have some food. The Queen sent it over.

402
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,430
Your Highness!

403
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:22,510
Excuse me!

404
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,480
Is there a well somewhere around here?

405
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:30,370
Could you tell me where...

406
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:43,610
Do you sell this water? I'm short on money...

407
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,070
Who are you?

408
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,280
Anybody there?

409
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:45,940
How much are the dumplings?

410
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:51,410
How many can I eat with this?

411
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,260
But this is too much!

412
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:15,890
For real, Ansan's house has the best Arabian wine!

413
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:19,720
"Where was Ansan's house again?"

414
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:22,290
Where was Ansan's house again?

415
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:24,170
How can you not know?

416
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:27,960
It's at Namsan Village...

417
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,370
You know, right at the entrance.

418
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:33,490
- Oh, that's where it is!<br>- You can't miss it!

419
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:37,630
You can smell the alcohol from a hundred feet away.

420
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:40,240
That's right!

421
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,160
- Don't you want to go?<br>- Yeah...

422
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:25,500
It's my first time seeing a woman eat so well.

423
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:30,570
I don't think her teacher fed her too well.

424
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:33,420
This won't do.

425
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:36,680
I think I need to set up another food stand on her way.

426
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:40,960
What about a food stand with steamed meat?

427
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:47,390
I'm on it.

428
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:19,080
It's a relief... that you're still living well.

429
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:23,320
And for meeting each other again.

430
00:45:03,770 --> 00:45:06,290
<i>When you meet Teacher Lee, hand him this letter.</i>

431
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:09,560
<i>Won't you go with me, Father?</i>

432
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:12,020
<i> Goo Hyeong will take you there.</i>

433
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:15,380
<i>- When can I go back home?<br>- Never is for the best.</i>

434
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:18,580
<i>Do you like seeing me cry?</i>

435
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:22,160
<i>San.</i>

436
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:28,570
<i>Now people will think Bi Yeon with her scar is you.</i>

437
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:33,180
<i>But if you're besides her, that secret will be revealed. </i>

438
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:38,420
<i>I won't let it be revealed. I'm good at keeping promises!</i>

439
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:42,990
<i>Someone is</i>

440
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:45,720
<i>targeting our household AND you.</i>

441
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:50,370
<i>One false move and we could be framed for treason.</i>

442
00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:55,140
<i>I'll never call you father. I won't even breathe!</i>

443
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:58,150
<i>Please let me stay with you!</i>

444
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:08,420
<i>You could be sent to Yuan as tribute.</i>

445
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:13,290
<i>I ask... for your understanding.</i>

446
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:19,790
<i>I'm sending you off, to protect you.</i>

447
00:46:20,850 --> 00:46:22,640
<i>My child...</i>

448
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,720
<i>San.</i>

449
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:31,300
<i>From now on, your name is So Ah.</i>

450
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:37,600
<i> Like a small wild flower in a vast meadow, live a quiet life.</i>

451
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:50,250
Miss!

452
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:54,830
Miss!

453
00:46:54,830 --> 00:46:56,900
You're going to cry again?

454
00:46:57,430 --> 00:46:59,250
You are!

455
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:06,960
What should I do with this crybaby?

456
00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:10,970
Dad's healthy and strong I assume?

457
00:47:10,970 --> 00:47:16,330
He just got back from Yuan on a business journey.

458
00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:20,620
- I think I need to go searching for a virtuous widow.<br>- Miss!

459
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:23,420
Someone that can nag at him and look over his health.

460
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:26,360
- But you know...<br>- What?

461
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:32,420
So he does! There's a widow he's meeting!

462
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:36,160
Not a widow, but suspicious people keep coming.

463
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:39,980
- Suspicious?<br>- It seems Master keeps turning them away though.

464
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:43,920
- Who?<br>- I don't know, that's why it's suspicious.

465
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,260
I guess it wasn't a widow.

466
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:50,870
A family must be offering him a virgin's hand in marriage!

467
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:53,530
That girl must be around our age.

468
00:47:53,530 --> 00:47:56,460
That's why dad feels like he's in an awkward situation and turns them away.

469
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:58,820
Give it a rest!

470
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:02,130
I should tell mother to keep her guard up.

471
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:03,790
You're going to see her?

472
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:05,580
I should, when there are no eyes watching.

473
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:07,720
Leave your bag here.

474
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:10,200
- I'm not sleeping here.<br>- Why not?

475
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:13,070
People are watching. I'm going to sleep in the servants quarters.

476
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:15,360
Miss!

477
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:23,160
You must have caught a cold. So sleep here for tonight-

478
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:32,040
I want to eat them all.

479
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:59,110
<i>Lady Sook of Ansan Kim Clan's Memorial Tablet.</i>

480
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:46,290
Have you been well?

481
00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:48,940
You're taller every time I see you.

482
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:53,140
I've been all grown for quite some time already.

483
00:50:58,110 --> 00:51:00,600
How are your hands so rough?

484
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:04,460
Are the senior boys still telling you to chop wood and do laundry?

485
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:07,330
There's a bunch of kids I manage that are so good, you know.

486
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:09,650
These days, I don't even need to tell them with words.

487
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:12,500
They figure out just what to do by a look from me.

488
00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:20,300
But a rascal like that still cries so easily?

489
00:51:22,730 --> 00:51:25,110
You've aged a lot, My Lord.

490
00:51:25,110 --> 00:51:27,070
Hey!

491
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:32,850
Everyday, I missed you.

492
00:51:32,850 --> 00:51:37,930
Yes. I have as well.

493
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:34,490
You eat well.

494
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:38,190
I have a friend, you see.

495
00:52:38,190 --> 00:52:40,850
He would've nagged again if he saw me.

496
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:45,650
How is it that you set an appointment without a date or time?

497
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:48,010
Snickering away.

498
00:52:48,810 --> 00:52:53,490
I did good by coming here without telling him, right?

499
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:08,370
You should say hello first thing when you come.

500
00:54:11,830 --> 00:54:14,460
When people eat other people's food, they usually

501
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:19,340
say 'I'll eat it well' and also 'thank you'.

502
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:21,980
- What crime did you commit? <br>- A crime?

503
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:25,030
If it required the guard command from the palace to come after,

504
00:54:25,030 --> 00:54:27,190
I believe it wouldn't be an ordinary crime.

505
00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:30,710
Then you helped a criminal escape?

506
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:33,950
Regard it as me paying my debt back to you.

507
00:54:33,950 --> 00:54:35,660
What debt?

508
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:48,950
Resent no one and always live life smiling like that.

509
00:54:48,950 --> 00:54:50,850
My Agassi.

510
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:53,490
You!

511
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:56,980
Thanks to you relaying the late Madam's last words.

512
00:54:56,980 --> 00:54:59,790
You remembered me?

513
00:54:59,790 --> 00:55:04,530
Always remembering and grateful, I have been.

514
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:11,120
Then why did you feign ignorance of me?

515
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:16,640
Helping you escape today was for the repayment and the snow dew wine this morning was the interest payment on it.

516
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:19,220
With those, the calculations are cleared between us.

517
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:21,250
You mean . . .

518
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:24,150
I am living in hiding right now.

519
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:28,910
So that no one ever knows I was the maid that day.

520
00:55:29,710 --> 00:55:32,140
But then you showed up.

521
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,670
You mean, let's not meet again?

522
00:55:34,670 --> 00:55:36,360
Yup!

523
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:38,770
I came to tell you that.

524
00:55:38,770 --> 00:55:43,600
If you ever try to find me again or I hear about you clamor about me . . .

525
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,440
If so?

526
00:55:46,530 --> 00:55:48,310
Perhaps then,

527
00:55:51,770 --> 00:55:53,990
I will need to kill you.

528
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:15,060
<i>Timing and Subtitles Created by The Royal Minions @ Viki </i>

529
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:32,750
My very birth was a crime.

530
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:38,960
If you will kill me, there should be so many people who will shed tears of joy.

531
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:45,370
I always kept these thoughts.

532
00:56:45,370 --> 00:56:50,410
If it's for them, wouldn't my dying be a best?

533
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:57,630
If I die, there is only one person in the entire land who would cry for me.

534
00:56:57,630 --> 00:57:00,390
The friend you were with?

535
00:57:01,130 --> 00:57:02,650
Yes.

536
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:08,900
I haven't been able to die, fearing he might cry.

537
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:18,260
But when the time comes that I made the judgement that I really must die, I will seek your favor on it.

538
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:20,100
What are you talking about?

539
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:24,810
Since I don't believe I'd be too mad if I died by your hand.

540
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:33,710
The authority to kill me whenever. I now give you that.

541
00:57:36,330 --> 00:57:38,340
In that case,

542
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:45,990
for that, I will need to continue seeing you.
