00:10:47,211 --> 00:10:49,546
Got smoked.
Went by "Boot"?

162
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:52,181
Coke, heavyweight?

163
00:10:55,886 --> 00:10:57,554
Hey.
Hey, Jamal...

164
00:11:17,975 --> 00:11:20,543
You know I tossed you a bone
letting you slide in the past.

165
00:11:20,578 --> 00:11:21,645
And I do appreciate it.

166
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:23,079
<i>I know they're working for you.</i>

167
00:11:23,113 --> 00:11:25,715
But if I ever get proof that
they're your dope boys,

168
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,183
I'm runnin' you in, okay?

169
00:11:29,987 --> 00:11:33,623
It's straight,
Jamal. Go.

170
00:11:33,658 --> 00:11:37,126
I ain't gonna say the what's,
when's, and why's of nothin'.

171
00:11:37,161 --> 00:11:39,596
Somebody slangin' some 'caine.

172
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:42,599
I guess it's from
Lowdown's crew.

173
00:11:42,633 --> 00:11:44,934
Lowdown?

174
00:11:44,968 --> 00:11:46,936
I dunno, I ain't said nothin'.

175
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:49,071
But I guess there
was some weight.

176
00:11:49,106 --> 00:11:51,441
Smack talk about some
robbery or somethin'.

177
00:11:51,475 --> 00:11:53,610
Smoked somebody's ass,
but I don't know.

178
00:11:53,644 --> 00:11:55,612
Okay.

179
00:11:57,948 --> 00:11:59,081
Okay.

180
00:11:59,116 --> 00:12:01,117
Good.

181
00:12:05,523 --> 00:12:08,191
Baby? Baby?

182
00:12:09,293 --> 00:12:10,993
What?

183
00:12:14,198 --> 00:12:15,365
This is crazy.

184
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:17,500
I'll call my buddy Fats.
He'll take it.

185
00:12:19,637 --> 00:12:21,070
Okay.

186
00:12:24,542 --> 00:12:27,377
I just...
I can't believe I did all this.

187
00:12:27,411 --> 00:12:28,911
You didn't do all this.

188
00:12:28,946 --> 00:12:31,748
Really?

189
00:12:31,782 --> 00:12:35,151
Nobody else was shootin' their
load to make the decisions.

190
00:12:35,185 --> 00:12:38,120
You kept things goin'.

191
00:12:38,155 --> 00:12:40,223
No.

192
00:12:42,326 --> 00:12:43,793
We were right.

193
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:49,065
Things just moved too quick.

194
00:12:49,099 --> 00:12:52,101
We shoulda been,
shit, ten steps ahead.

195
00:12:52,135 --> 00:12:53,837
Well, we will be.

196
00:12:53,871 --> 00:12:56,138
From now on.

197
00:12:58,175 --> 00:13:00,777
'Cause things are probably gonna
get worse before they get better.

198
00:13:04,047 --> 00:13:06,315
<i>( music plays within )</i>

199
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,984

200
00:13:08,018 --> 00:13:10,286
<i>( dog barking )</i>

201
00:13:13,858 --> 00:13:16,158
Isaiah around?

202
00:13:23,967 --> 00:13:25,568
How'd you jack up your hand?

203
00:13:25,603 --> 00:13:28,505
A-K's pecker's
too big.

204
00:13:28,539 --> 00:13:31,574
That's not what the
Woodward honeys are saying.

205
00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:36,846
Isaiah:
<i>Well, God and damn.</i>

206
00:13:36,881 --> 00:13:40,249
A real Homicide detective
as I live and breathe.

207
00:13:40,284 --> 00:13:41,418
Keeping us safe?

208
00:13:41,452 --> 00:13:45,054
- Good to see ya, Frank.
- You too, Isaiah.

209
00:13:45,088 --> 00:13:47,891
- 'Round here, it's Reverend.
- You know, I'm not a religious man,

210
00:13:47,925 --> 00:13:51,160
but even I think a title like that
oughta have some kind of plausibility.

211
00:13:51,194 --> 00:13:54,230
Does to those who
entrust me with it.

212
00:13:55,265 --> 00:13:56,766
Would you take a walk?

213
00:14:04,107 --> 00:14:07,243
He's a big boy.
He don't need your help.

214
00:14:14,318 --> 00:14:15,952
We know what's up.

215
00:14:15,986 --> 00:14:17,253
What's that?

216
00:14:17,287 --> 00:14:20,924
No games.
We know.

217
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,926
"Boot" here got smoked
in a trap house.

218
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,061
Suddenly one of your guys
is pushing weight.

219
00:14:25,095 --> 00:14:28,765
I don't know
what you're talking about.

220
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:31,200
Well, you need to know
what I'm talking about.

221
00:14:31,234 --> 00:14:34,170
Because we think he
killed Brendan McCann.

222
00:14:34,204 --> 00:14:36,906
Whoever killed him,
is also involved,

223
00:14:36,941 --> 00:14:39,375
you know what I'm saying?

224
00:14:39,409 --> 00:14:43,613
This ain't no B-on-B
crime that's gonna go away.

225
00:14:43,647 --> 00:14:46,683
Now, I'm coming with respect.

226
00:14:47,785 --> 00:14:49,752
I know a lot of guys
looking to find out

227
00:14:49,787 --> 00:14:52,121
whoever's involved
in McCann's murder.

228
00:14:52,155 --> 00:14:56,860
I may not be able to come with
so much respect next time, see?

229
00:14:56,894 --> 00:15:00,396
Drop a name.
Any heat on you drops with it.

230
00:15:03,066 --> 00:15:06,002
You got a lot
of crabgrass there, Nate.

231
00:15:06,036 --> 00:15:10,306
They got the good stuff on sale
at the corner-- clear that right up.

232
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,808
I'll get some today.
Thank you.

233
00:15:14,344 --> 00:15:16,078
Truth is,

234
00:15:16,113 --> 00:15:19,482
I don't know anything about
McCann or some drug dealer who's slippin'.

235
00:15:19,517 --> 00:15:22,685
Both of 'em shoulda been
more careful, I guess.

236
00:15:25,222 --> 00:15:28,691
Let me disseminate,
see what shakes loose.

237
00:15:28,726 --> 00:15:31,160
( car engine starts )

238
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:39,101
Any of you punk-ass
hood rats

239
00:15:39,136 --> 00:15:42,104
know why a Homicide detective
is rollin' up on <i>me?</i>

240
00:15:48,646 --> 00:15:51,514
Belongs to these two.
That guy was driving.

241
00:15:51,549 --> 00:15:54,517
Does look like a Challenger,
doesn't it?

242
00:15:54,552 --> 00:15:59,022
Oh, Dani Kahlil.
Check-plus smiley-face.

243
00:16:00,591 --> 00:16:01,724
Frank know?

244
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,660
Frank know what?

245
00:16:03,694 --> 00:16:06,663
I found a homeless person in the
neighborhood where Billy was killed.

246
00:16:06,697 --> 00:16:09,999
She saw a Challenger parked
outside the trap house.

247
00:16:10,034 --> 00:16:12,201
No kidding.
A plate?

248
00:16:12,235 --> 00:16:16,706
No, but I found a Challenger
parked outside Abusauan's store

249
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,842
<i>around the corner that morning.</i>

250
00:16:19,877 --> 00:16:22,244
- This look like my boy, you stupid bitch?
- Excuse me?

251
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:24,146
You came to my house,
acting like y'all care.

252
00:16:24,181 --> 00:16:26,649
Then you saying he a killer?
A cop killer?

253
00:16:26,684 --> 00:16:28,685
- Miss--
- Uh-uh. You too.

254
00:16:28,719 --> 00:16:31,554
There with your girl. How you feel
if somebody call her a killer?

255
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:33,389
Okay.

256
00:16:33,423 --> 00:16:34,757
You sayin' that my boy
was with a camel and killed a cop?

257
00:16:34,792 --> 00:16:36,258
That's what you tellin' me?

258
00:16:36,293 --> 00:16:39,195
<i>He hated Chaldeans.</i>
<i>He could barely tolerate whitey.</i>

259
00:16:39,229 --> 00:16:42,665
Kahlil: <i>I am sorry what
happened to your son,</i>

260
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,933
<i>but this is not</i>
<i>how you deal with this.</i>

261
00:16:43,968 --> 00:16:45,267
Shut your mouth.

262
00:16:45,302 --> 00:16:47,169
Kahlil: <i>Your son is a
person of interest.</i>

263
00:16:47,204 --> 00:16:49,973
Rosyln:
<i>Person of interest, my ass.</i>

264
00:17:01,112 --> 00:17:04,647
Just give me a sec, huh?

265
00:17:07,518 --> 00:17:11,154
So Frank was real smooth
sneakin' outta there like that, huh?

266
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:12,389
That's one way of putting it.

267
00:17:12,423 --> 00:17:14,824
How ya been?

268
00:17:14,858 --> 00:17:17,160
Fine.

269
00:17:17,195 --> 00:17:19,796
I mean, you and Frank.

270
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,364
Me and Frank?

271
00:17:21,399 --> 00:17:23,433
C'mon.

272
00:17:23,468 --> 00:17:26,236
I am a detective, D.
I see how he looks at you.

273
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:28,105
You guys hang after the fight?

274
00:17:28,139 --> 00:17:31,074
No.
There's nothing's going on there.

275
00:17:31,109 --> 00:17:33,610
Make sure everyone else
knows that too, please.

276
00:17:33,644 --> 00:17:34,911
Sewing circle around here.

277
00:17:34,945 --> 00:17:36,246
Come on, we all do it.

278
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,048
I hit LC, who hit Hernandez,
who hit Shana,

279
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:42,352
who I think hit the boss.

280
00:17:42,386 --> 00:17:44,354
It's what we do.
Share it all.

281
00:17:44,388 --> 00:17:46,423
Including STD's.

282
00:17:46,457 --> 00:17:47,924
Well, you know what they say,

283
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:51,828
incest is okay
as long as you keep it in the family.

284
00:17:55,399 --> 00:17:57,334
So, who's Frank hooked up with?

285
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:02,739
That is a good question.

286
00:18:02,773 --> 00:18:05,708
My man keeps
his biz on lockdown.

287
00:18:09,947 --> 00:18:11,148
Did you catch a nickname,
anything?

288
00:18:11,182 --> 00:18:12,549
Clerk:
<i>I told you, nothing.</i>

The idiot was bitching about
the price of Pall Malls.

290
00:18:23,494 --> 00:18:25,462
Hey, Habib.

291
00:18:25,496 --> 00:18:28,865
You remember if the cheap son of a
bitch's buddy pawed these mags?

292
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:32,068
I dunno, they all do.
And they don't even buy 'em.

293
00:18:32,102 --> 00:18:35,805
Great. So you won't mind if we take
'em for fingerprints then, will ya?

294
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:39,019
Just be cool,
we'll return 'em to you...

295
00:18:40,678 --> 00:18:42,668
at some point.

296
00:18:54,024 --> 00:18:55,792

00:19:14,245 --> 00:19:16,446
Hey, man, what's up?
Is Michael home?

299
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,248
No, I thought he was with you.

300
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:22,352
Nah, nah, he hooked up with this
DTF black chick last night.

301
00:19:22,386 --> 00:19:26,223
He was totally sprung.
They left together.

302
00:19:26,257 --> 00:19:27,857
It's all right.
I'll just keep callin' him.

303
00:19:27,891 --> 00:19:29,526
He does this all the time.
Thanks, man.

304
00:19:33,531 --> 00:19:35,798
( tires screech )

305
00:19:37,335 --> 00:19:39,836
You got us there.
I closed it.

306
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,738
It's what partners do.

307
00:19:41,772 --> 00:19:43,440
We're partners, huh?

308
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:47,810
Better you than some rook with
a hot dog hangin' out his ass.

309
00:19:47,845 --> 00:19:49,779
Thanks.

310
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:53,049
Oh, I figure you got a year,
eighteen months left.

311
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:56,586
Everybody knows
this is just a pit stop for you.

312
00:19:56,621 --> 00:19:58,121
So, whatcha thinking?

313
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:00,223
FBI? CIA?

314
00:20:00,258 --> 00:20:02,225
Maybe get yourself a
decent pay over there.

315
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,893
Now I'm confused.

316
00:20:03,927 --> 00:20:06,630
Are you trying to sleep
with me or get rid of me?

317
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:11,234
I'm just saying I'm glad you're
here for McCann's murder.

318
00:20:11,269 --> 00:20:15,071
Well, technically
I'm on Billy's murder.

319
00:20:15,105 --> 00:20:17,140
And it's not making sense.

320
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:19,008
Why?

321
00:20:19,042 --> 00:20:21,311
So...

322
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:25,148
Billy and the other guy from the
sketch killed Anton and McCann?

323
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:28,551
Yeah.
Mr. X in the sketch is the key.

324
00:20:28,586 --> 00:20:30,019
And then Mr. X
killed Billy?

325
00:20:30,053 --> 00:20:34,056
Well, he won't be Mr. X
once we lift these prints.

326
00:20:34,091 --> 00:20:38,561
So if Mr. X killed two people
with Billy, dumped the bodies,

327
00:20:38,596 --> 00:20:40,563
then what the hell's he doing
hanging at a liquor store

328
00:20:40,598 --> 00:20:43,700
with another white guy before
he goes back to kill Billy?

329
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:49,372
I dunno. Maybe there were
three people involved.

330
00:20:49,407 --> 00:20:52,175
Maybe Mr. X is a
sociopath who can

331
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:56,746
stroll up for some beef jerky
after he's already killed two brothers.

332
00:20:56,781 --> 00:20:59,749
All I'm saying is I seen some
straight crazy over the years

333
00:20:59,784 --> 00:21:02,185
that you just can't explain.

334
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,621
That's why we follow
the evidence.

335
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,369
How'd it go?

336
00:21:25,476 --> 00:21:27,744
( sobs )

337
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:43,960
And buy cheap ones.

338
00:21:43,994 --> 00:21:47,597
Tampon too good,
absorb natural fluid.

339
00:21:47,631 --> 00:21:49,799
Get toxic shock.

340
00:21:49,834 --> 00:21:51,701
And get cigarettes.

341
00:21:51,736 --> 00:21:55,271
And pot pies-- beef.
And come right back.

342
00:21:55,305 --> 00:21:56,406
Okay.

343

How are you?

350
00:23:05,643 --> 00:23:07,610
Okay.

351
00:23:07,645 --> 00:23:09,211
What you doing here?

352
00:23:09,246 --> 00:23:11,815
After I saw you
like that last night, I...

353
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:13,983
Like what?

354
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:15,351
Scared.

355
00:23:15,385 --> 00:23:18,020
I wasn't scared.
It was my computer.

356
00:23:18,055 --> 00:23:21,491
Look, I know what happened
the night Joe took you to Windsor.

357
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:24,026
You don't need
to be afraid anymore.

358
00:23:24,061 --> 00:23:27,296
Okay?
I'm gonna fix it.

359
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:31,067
How did you end up here?

360
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:35,738
I don't know.
This where I work now.

361
00:23:35,773 --> 00:23:37,974
Why didn't you call me?
Did you get my messages?

362
00:23:38,008 --> 00:23:40,209
They took my phone.

363
00:23:40,243 --> 00:23:42,311
But you could've called me
from anywhere.

364
00:23:42,346 --> 00:23:43,346
I don't know.

365
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:48,317
I left Detroit and...

366
00:23:48,352 --> 00:23:49,819
I didn't know what to say.

367
00:23:49,854 --> 00:23:53,255
Well...

368
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:56,192
it's okay now.

369
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:57,527
Your friend can say
you ran off,

370
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:59,161
gone without a trace.
Nobody's the wiser.

371
00:23:59,196 --> 00:24:02,365
- Then what?
- Huh? Then what?

372
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:03,833
Yes, then what?

373
00:24:03,868 --> 00:24:07,770
Then it's just us.

374
00:24:07,805 --> 00:24:10,940
What's that mean?

375
00:24:10,975 --> 00:24:14,844
Mean we move
into your house together?

376
00:24:14,879 --> 00:24:19,115
Go on dates,
with your cop friends?

377
00:24:19,149 --> 00:24:22,385
What? No, no...

378
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:25,688
I'm not going back to Detroit.

379
00:24:25,723 --> 00:24:27,123
I have to go.
I'm sorry.

380
00:24:27,157 --> 00:24:28,290
- Katia--
- Stop.

381
00:24:28,325 --> 00:24:29,893
We talked about this.

382
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:33,129
Whatever debt you
have with whoever, I can fix it.

383
00:24:33,163 --> 00:24:35,131
Everything's gonna
be okay, I promise.

384
00:24:35,165 --> 00:24:37,634
- Please, go home.
- Look, you don't need to be scared.

385
00:24:37,668 --> 00:24:39,235
I can keep you safe.

386
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:41,571
That's not it.

387
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:46,576
Then what is it?

388
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:50,647
You're a good man, Frank.

389
00:24:50,681 --> 00:24:52,415
But you were a trick.

390
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:54,050
What?

391
00:24:54,084 --> 00:24:57,654
I'm sorry.
It's my job.

392
00:24:57,688 --> 00:25:00,924
To make you feel good.

393
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:04,160
You know how many men say
they run away with me?

394
00:25:04,194 --> 00:25:05,762
This isn't like that.

395
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:08,297
Name one thing I like.

396
00:25:08,331 --> 00:25:11,133
Come on, Katia,

397
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:15,438
you like...
you like lots of things.

398
00:25:18,275 --> 00:25:21,110

400
00:25:46,315 --> 00:25:50,285
Missed ya last time. The phone
number you gave me was disconnected.

401
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:53,321
Ahem.
Sorry-- sorry about that.

402
00:25:53,356 --> 00:25:57,359
Do you have access
to a phone regularly?

on the phone.

406
00:26:04,767 --> 00:26:07,335
Okay.

407
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:09,938

00:26:16,812 --> 00:26:18,113
I don't know.

411
00:26:18,147 --> 00:26:19,681
Have you been
taking it regularly?

412
00:26:19,715 --> 00:26:21,950
<i>Sometimes.</i>

413
00:26:21,984 --> 00:26:25,787

diligent about that, okay?</i>

415
00:26:33,762 --> 00:26:35,097

Hey, look, you found me.

I just needed to clear my head.

Everything.

I, uh...
I'm sorry about the other night.

453
00:32:29,105 --> 00:32:31,439
It's fine.
You didn't do anything wrong.

454
00:32:31,474 --> 00:32:33,675
I shouldn't have
behaved like that. I...

455
00:32:33,709 --> 00:32:36,979
I mean, I've been
thinking about it.

456

I've been thinking about you...

Frank, you're not
in great shape.

Don't worry.

460
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:35,637
I'll call ya.

461
00:33:46,415 --> 00:33:48,550
It was the smart play.

462
00:33:48,584 --> 00:33:51,586
But it had to be done,
right, baby?

463
00:33:52,588 --> 00:33:55,523
Yeah, baby.
It had to be done.

466
00:34:23,486 --> 00:34:26,621
Why'd you really come over
here last night, Frank?

467
00:34:28,091 --> 00:34:30,192
Was it just to get some?

468
00:34:32,428 --> 00:34:35,463
If it is, it's okay.

469
00:34:35,498 --> 00:34:38,300
It's what we do, right?

<i>( footsteps fading )</i>

471
00:34:55,351 --> 00:34:58,686
I'd get to my purpose fast.

472
00:35:00,656 --> 00:35:05,560
I shot Billy and I used your
drugs to open the blind pig.

473
00:35:05,594 --> 00:35:08,696
Is that all?

474
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:10,966
Lowdown's coming after me.

475
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,601
Now, why would he do that?

476
00:35:13,636 --> 00:35:16,238
Because they robbed me

477
00:35:16,272 --> 00:35:18,040
and they stole your drugs.

478
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:20,175
And they killed Michael.

479
00:35:20,209 --> 00:35:23,812
So we hit back.

480
00:35:23,846 --> 00:35:26,448
It's unfortunate when something
you worked hard to attain

481
00:35:26,482 --> 00:35:28,317
is taken from you, isn't it?

482
00:35:28,351 --> 00:35:29,451
Yes.

483
00:35:29,485 --> 00:35:32,487
Did you see your friend die?

484
00:35:32,521 --> 00:35:36,091
Were you there
when it happened?

485
00:35:36,125 --> 00:35:37,592
Yeah.

486
00:35:37,626 --> 00:35:40,929
Now you need me--
to protect you?

487
00:35:40,964 --> 00:35:42,797
After your transgressions.

488
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:51,506
I'll give you double the
taxes on the International.

489
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:54,876
Plus I'll help you
get your drugs back.

490
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:59,514
That's of no interest to me.

491
00:35:59,548 --> 00:36:01,783
You already got
the cops thinking...

492
00:36:01,817 --> 00:36:04,186
you already got the cops
thinking that I killed McCann.

493
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:06,488
Aren't we even now?

494
00:36:06,522 --> 00:36:10,625
You really thought I didn't know
what you were up to, Damon?

495
00:36:10,659 --> 00:36:14,496
You thought you were
better at this than me?

496
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:17,932
You're only up on two feet because
your old man knew his place.

497
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:19,401
But now...

498
00:36:19,435 --> 00:36:22,404
looks like we have
a situation, don't we?

499
00:36:27,743 --> 00:36:30,212
I know where you dumped
the guy from UAW.

500
00:36:33,616 --> 00:36:35,517
And his buddy, too.

501
00:36:35,551 --> 00:36:37,285
People would look
at that Ty Cobb statue

502
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,087
a lot differently
if they knew, wouldn't they?

503
00:36:42,425 --> 00:36:46,261
Yeah, others know too.

504
00:36:46,295 --> 00:36:49,631
So if anything
happens to me or Maya,

505
00:36:51,934 --> 00:36:55,570
your decrepit old ass
will die in a cell.

506
00:37:23,966 --> 00:37:26,068
Hey, bad news.

507
00:37:26,102 --> 00:37:28,002
No usable prints
from the magazines.

508
00:37:29,305 --> 00:37:31,573
Mm-hm.

509
00:37:35,778 --> 00:37:38,480
Where were you?

510
00:37:38,514 --> 00:37:40,148
What, are you writing a book?

511
00:37:40,183 --> 00:37:42,717
Geddes: <i>Just like to know why you
vanished for a day and a half.</i>

512
00:37:42,751 --> 00:37:46,221
When you sign my checks,
I'll tell you.

513
00:37:58,101 --> 00:37:59,734
Skelos:
<i>It took a lot of guts,</i>

514
00:37:59,768 --> 00:38:02,770
demanding to meet
in public like that.

515
00:38:02,805 --> 00:38:04,606
And why?

516
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,409
The reason for all this?

517
00:38:07,443 --> 00:38:12,414
To avenge a perceived slight
against Dad.

518
00:38:12,448 --> 00:38:16,151
Oh, how beautiful,

519
00:38:16,185 --> 00:38:18,686
how poetic.

520
00:38:18,721 --> 00:38:22,023
It's the stuff of Aeschylus.

521
00:38:22,057 --> 00:38:24,559
The irony though,

522
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:29,464
Damon's ambitions are more reflective
of myself than his father.

523
00:38:29,499 --> 00:38:32,100
I mean, his father
was a hard worker--

524
00:38:32,135 --> 00:38:34,936
Till you scraped everything and he had
nothin' left but a bloated liver, right?

525
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:36,171
Skelos: <i>He at least he
knew where he belonged.</i>

526
00:38:36,205 --> 00:38:39,707
You, on the other hand,
strive for more.

527
00:38:39,742 --> 00:38:44,379
Which got your dumb ass
in a whole heap of trouble.

528
00:38:44,413 --> 00:38:46,348
Damon: <i>I'm fine with
having beef with you.</i>

529
00:38:46,382 --> 00:38:49,184
Poppa T got
what he had coming to him.

530
00:38:49,218 --> 00:38:50,852
Which I will never forget.

531
00:38:50,886 --> 00:38:52,254
Damon:
<i>Don't.</i>

532
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:55,524
Skelos: <i>Well, the
way I view things,</i>

533
00:38:55,558 --> 00:38:59,227
there's no real protection
for anyone without peace.

534
00:38:59,262 --> 00:39:01,496
We taking the pig.

535
00:39:01,531 --> 00:39:04,932
The big screens, the fryers,
the whole nice set-up.

536
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:07,769
Skelos'll keep supplying--
knowingly, this time.

537
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:11,373
That's fine. Screw it.
Take the pig.

538
00:39:11,407 --> 00:39:12,940
Suits your kind
better anyway, right?

539
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:17,145
I will take over the
International as well.

540
00:39:20,115 --> 00:39:23,084
I'm sorry.

541
00:39:23,118 --> 00:39:26,488
I know it was your
family's business.

542
00:39:26,522 --> 00:39:28,623
Yeah.

543
00:39:28,658 --> 00:39:31,926
This could be one of
those game day spots.

544
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,495
Am I right?

545
00:39:33,529 --> 00:39:38,200
Get some jerseys, some ferns,
all that kind of nonsense.

546
00:39:38,234 --> 00:39:40,034
Make some bank.

547
00:39:40,069 --> 00:39:42,036
- I like that.
- Mm...

548
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:54,997
Lemme do that.

549
00:39:55,031 --> 00:39:56,331
I got it, Ma.

550
00:39:56,366 --> 00:39:59,869
April, get your butt in here
and start setting the table.

551
00:39:59,903 --> 00:40:02,371
They don't waste
any time, do they?

552
00:40:02,406 --> 00:40:04,607
So, how was it today?

553
00:40:04,641 --> 00:40:07,443
- All right.
- Hey, don't leave that out.

554
00:40:07,477 --> 00:40:09,077
Well, what is it?
Dishes or this?

555
00:40:09,112 --> 00:40:11,179
It'll be your ass
if you keep mouthing off.

556
00:40:11,214 --> 00:40:13,582
Well, did you make
any friends yet?

557
00:40:13,617 --> 00:40:15,651
- They're kinda nerdy. - Why? 'Cause
they're not throwing gang signs?

558
00:40:15,685 --> 00:40:19,054
Please. They give you communion
or confession dates yet?

559
00:40:19,088 --> 00:40:21,256
Gotta pass some
stupid prayer thing first.

560
00:40:21,291 --> 00:40:23,091
- I will quiz you.
- <i>Yay.</i>

561
00:40:23,126 --> 00:40:25,260
You know what?
You just go through the motions,

562
00:40:25,295 --> 00:40:27,296
but don't become
no damn Catholic.

563
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:30,098
Ma, she'll decide
what she wants.

564
00:40:30,133 --> 00:40:31,967
Still don't know how
you got to afford it.

565
00:40:32,001 --> 00:40:33,536
<i>That's because my boy</i>
<i>saves his pennies.</i>

566
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:37,239
Something your mama never did.

567
00:40:37,273 --> 00:40:40,042
At least you won't
have to deal with Sister Agnes.

568
00:40:40,076 --> 00:40:43,011
Made my life hell,
pun intended.

569
00:40:43,046 --> 00:40:46,749
Agnes? She teaches civics, she's
like a hundred and twelve.

570
00:40:46,783 --> 00:40:51,019
Jesus, don't nobody
leave that place?

571
00:40:59,395 --> 00:41:01,797
What up, dawg?

572
00:41:01,832 --> 00:41:03,632
What you got for me?

573
00:41:05,401 --> 00:41:07,703
Help yourself.

574
00:41:09,372 --> 00:41:11,774
So what you got?

575
00:41:11,808 --> 00:41:14,477
Got somebody you might wanna
look into about this.

576
00:41:17,681 --> 00:41:19,314
This from you or Lowdown?

577
00:41:19,349 --> 00:41:21,617
A-K just
a messenger.

578
00:41:24,888 --> 00:41:27,022
Well, who is it?

579
00:41:27,056 --> 00:41:30,158
You want some coffee?
Maybe some pop?

580
00:41:30,193 --> 00:41:31,827
I know it's late,
but--

581
00:41:31,862 --> 00:41:33,696
I'm fine, thanks.

582
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:36,164
And thanks again for
allowing me to come over.

583
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:38,400
I don't know what
else to tell ya.

584
00:41:38,434 --> 00:41:40,870
They're runnin' that sketch
pretty hard, aren't they?

585
00:41:40,904 --> 00:41:42,471
Yeah.

586
00:41:42,506 --> 00:41:44,607
Find anything?

587
00:41:44,641 --> 00:41:48,377
Well, that depends.

588
00:41:48,411 --> 00:41:50,746
What you described...

589
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:53,883
is that what you saw?

590
00:41:53,917 --> 00:41:55,050
Well, at this point,

591
00:41:55,084 --> 00:41:56,318
to tell you the truth...

592
00:41:56,352 --> 00:41:59,421
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>what the hell I saw.</i>

593
00:42:00,423 --> 00:42:02,758
<i>Looked like two men.</i>

594
00:42:02,792 --> 00:42:04,627
<i>One dark, one light--</i>

595
00:42:04,661 --> 00:42:09,331
<i>not sure about ethnicities</i>
<i>or none of that.</i>

596
00:42:09,365 --> 00:42:11,500
<i>They put a body in that car...</i>

597
00:42:12,702 --> 00:42:15,638
<i>and they put that car</i>
<i>in the river.</i>

598
00:42:15,672 --> 00:42:18,206
<i>By the time I was done</i>
<i>talking in that interview,</i>

599
00:42:18,241 --> 00:42:19,575
<i>I didn't know which end was up.</i>

600
00:42:23,647 --> 00:42:26,181
( beeps )

601
00:42:26,215 --> 00:42:27,983
<i>It never really</i>
<i>came across to me</i>

602
00:42:28,018 --> 00:42:31,554
<i>like it was</i>
<i>a Middle Eastern guy, though.</i>

603
00:42:31,588 --> 00:42:34,289
<i>Could be anybody, I guess.</i>

604
00:42:34,323 --> 00:42:36,291
