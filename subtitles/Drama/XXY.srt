1
00:03:23,157 --> 00:03:27,287
- Female.
- They're on their way.

2
00:03:28,662 --> 00:03:32,689
You go. I'll pick up Alex
and meet you at home.

3
00:04:05,165 --> 00:04:07,656
- Hello.
- Hello.

4
00:04:10,938 --> 00:04:12,200
You haven't changed.

5
00:04:12,339 --> 00:04:14,136
Hello Ramiro.

6
00:04:15,642 --> 00:04:17,075
Hello.

7
00:04:17,845 --> 00:04:19,813
Look at you, all grown up.

8
00:04:40,067 --> 00:04:44,731
- Okay. Did you get everything?
- Yes, Ramiro's reading the book.

9
00:04:44,838 --> 00:04:47,204
- I haven't spoken with Kraken.
- Why not?

10
00:04:47,307 --> 00:04:50,003
I'll find the time today.

11
00:04:50,377 --> 00:04:52,572
Ramiro didn't tell anybody, did he?

12
00:04:53,147 --> 00:04:55,877
No, he didn't. Don't worry.
He's discreet.

13
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:57,973
Look at this place. It's paradise!

14
00:05:58,111 --> 00:05:59,874
Álvaro!

15
00:06:03,517 --> 00:06:04,745
See how big he is.

16
00:06:04,852 --> 00:06:06,217
- Hello.
- Hi.

17
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,687
You don't remember me.
- He was too young. Come on.

18
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:12,258
Hello, how are you?

19
00:06:12,726 --> 00:06:14,125
Welcome.

20
00:06:15,762 --> 00:06:17,855
- Let me get that.
- Thanks.

21
00:06:44,725 --> 00:06:47,250
Álvaro, come, it's here.

22
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:53,496
Alex likes to take a nap
on this couch. It's cool here.

23
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,502
You'll share the bathroom.
To give your parents some privacy.

24
00:06:58,238 --> 00:07:00,638
- What's this?
- Homeopathy.

25
00:07:00,807 --> 00:07:04,072
That one is for people
who're afraid of being hurt...

26
00:07:04,211 --> 00:07:05,872
The fear of getting hurt.

27
00:07:26,266 --> 00:07:27,756
Hi.

28
00:07:29,136 --> 00:07:30,626
Hi.

29
00:07:31,538 --> 00:07:33,733
- You just had a wank.
- What?

30
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,241
- There in your room.
- How do you know?

31
00:07:37,411 --> 00:07:41,848
- I can tell.
- Do you jerk off too?

32
00:07:41,949 --> 00:07:44,144
Every day.

33
00:07:50,223 --> 00:07:52,555
I'd never been to Uruguay.

34
00:07:52,793 --> 00:07:56,024
We're talking about jerking off,
not Uruguay?

35
00:08:02,502 --> 00:08:05,903
- How old are you?
- Fifteen.

36
00:08:12,012 --> 00:08:15,072
I've never fucked anybody.
Would you like too?

37
00:08:15,215 --> 00:08:18,013
- With whom?
- With me.

38
00:08:18,185 --> 00:08:20,050
With you?

39
00:08:40,607 --> 00:08:42,939
- Alvaro, you want some?
- No, I'm vegetarian.

40
00:08:43,043 --> 00:08:45,910
- Are you serious?
- He won't touch a thing.

41
00:08:46,146 --> 00:08:48,614
I don't like trying anything new.

42
00:08:49,282 --> 00:08:50,681
Hi honey!

43
00:08:50,917 --> 00:08:52,009
Hi.

44
00:08:52,152 --> 00:08:54,518
This is Alex. Erica...

45
00:08:54,621 --> 00:08:56,179
Hello?

46
00:08:56,723 --> 00:08:59,248
- Ramiro.
- Hello.

47
00:09:02,763 --> 00:09:05,755
- You two have met, right?
- No.

48
00:09:06,033 --> 00:09:08,263
Álvaro, Alex.

49
00:09:08,468 --> 00:09:11,801
Your mum used to say
she'd have four daughters.

50
00:09:11,972 --> 00:09:13,803
We'd call her a
'Desperate Housewife'.

51
00:09:15,175 --> 00:09:18,576
So the desperate housewife
got scared along the way..

52
00:09:22,849 --> 00:09:24,908
- Do you go to school?
- I used to.

53
00:09:25,018 --> 00:09:28,613
- What do you mean 'used to'?
- I'm getting expelled on Monday.

54
00:09:28,722 --> 00:09:33,216
- What happened?
- I punched Vando. I broke his nose.

55
00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:37,588
Why what happened?

56
00:09:50,077 --> 00:09:53,535
- Who is Vando?
- Her best friend.

57
00:09:53,847 --> 00:09:57,374
Friend or boyfriend?
You don't do that to a friend.

58
00:10:55,275 --> 00:11:00,679
- When will she speak to him?
- She said tomorrow.

59
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,006
"In all vertebrates,
including the human being...

60
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:42,844
the female sex is dominant in an
evolutionary and embryological sense."

61
00:13:14,414 --> 00:13:17,713
We should arrange to meet
Vando's parents.

62
00:13:18,084 --> 00:13:19,813
To apologize.

63
00:13:19,953 --> 00:13:23,855
To apologize? Us?
For breaking that asshole's nose?

64
00:13:23,957 --> 00:13:26,482
It's them who should apologize.

65
00:13:27,861 --> 00:13:31,126
- He's Alex best friend.
- Was.

66
00:13:50,016 --> 00:13:52,348
Why didn't you tell me
he's a surgeon?

67
00:13:52,485 --> 00:13:55,545
- He's the best.
- Says who? him?

68
00:13:55,689 --> 00:13:59,125
- No, I did some research.
- Research?

69
00:13:59,426 --> 00:14:01,189
Since when?

70
00:14:01,361 --> 00:14:02,953
- I'm not the enemy.
- No?

71
00:14:03,063 --> 00:14:04,587
No.

72
00:14:10,003 --> 00:14:13,166
She's not taking them anymore.
Did you know?

73
00:14:14,441 --> 00:14:16,534
No, I didn't.

74
00:14:48,274 --> 00:14:50,265
- Do you like it?
- What?

75
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:52,307
My house.

76
00:14:53,046 --> 00:14:54,377
Yes.

77
00:14:59,652 --> 00:15:01,677
Don't lie to me.

78
00:15:22,709 --> 00:15:25,371
Do you like cutting people up?

79
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,846
It's my job.

80
00:15:35,355 --> 00:15:37,016
<i>Alex.</i>

81
00:15:37,524 --> 00:15:40,459
Hurry up!

82
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,891
<i>Do you read me, Kraken</i>

83
00:15:42,028 --> 00:15:45,486
<i>They're taking the turtles to the port.</i>

84
00:15:45,598 --> 00:15:47,725
<i>- Where are they?
- 10 miles offshore.</i>

85
00:15:47,834 --> 00:15:48,528
I'm on my way.

86
00:16:07,487 --> 00:16:09,421
- Can I come?
- Climb in.

87
00:16:52,165 --> 00:16:54,395
One of them lost a front flipper.

88
00:16:59,205 --> 00:17:01,571
- Where did they show up?
- 10 miles offshore.

89
00:17:01,674 --> 00:17:03,699
They were following
a shoal of sprats.

90
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:05,641
They were in the water
for 20 hours...

91
00:17:05,778 --> 00:17:07,006
caught in a net.

92
00:17:07,147 --> 00:17:08,671
Poor things.

93
00:17:08,815 --> 00:17:10,373
- Can you identify them??
- Yes.

94
00:17:24,898 --> 00:17:28,959
- Where are the others?
- My son said there were.

95
00:17:30,103 --> 00:17:32,537
Where are they?

96
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:39,778
You have something for me, Esteban?

97
00:17:40,613 --> 00:17:41,910
Nothing.

98
00:17:42,048 --> 00:17:45,711
- Are you sure?
- Are you a biologist or a cop?

99
00:17:45,818 --> 00:17:49,151
You should come with an apology
rather than an attitude.

100
00:17:49,289 --> 00:17:52,725
My son was spitting blood.
She broke his nose..

101
00:17:52,825 --> 00:17:54,986
My wife wants to report it.

102
00:17:55,094 --> 00:17:58,063
She'd better not come round here again.

103
00:18:06,773 --> 00:18:07,967
<i>Wait, Alex.</i>

104
00:18:08,107 --> 00:18:09,165
Alex.

105
00:18:09,275 --> 00:18:12,369
What are you looking at?

106
00:18:12,512 --> 00:18:15,208
Enough already.

107
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:19,544
<i>That's it, take her away.</i>

108
00:18:19,686 --> 00:18:23,486
Too many endagered species as it is.

109
00:18:34,167 --> 00:18:36,533
Your son is afraid of my daughter?

110
00:18:36,903 --> 00:18:38,336
- Your son is a traitor.
- Dad.

111
00:18:38,438 --> 00:18:41,032
- I won't allow...
- You won't allow what?

112
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:44,234
She's capable of breaking
his nose again!

113
00:18:44,377 --> 00:18:45,742
She's just like me!

114
00:18:45,878 --> 00:18:48,039
<i>She's capable of doing it! </i>

115
00:19:10,703 --> 00:19:14,400
- Who did you tell?
- Just Vando.

116
00:19:22,749 --> 00:19:26,207
If I'm so special
why can't I talk about it?

117
00:19:55,381 --> 00:19:58,179
In the end, our fathers
are in the same business.

118
00:20:00,353 --> 00:20:05,347
- Will it live?
- Yes, but it'll never go back to ocean.

119
00:20:08,127 --> 00:20:11,790
- How many boob-jobs has your dad done?
- I don't know.

120
00:20:12,665 --> 00:20:15,930
- You're a freak.
- So are you.

121
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:19,903
- I bet he's done thousands.
- yes.

122
00:20:20,006 --> 00:20:21,940
- Have you ever been?
- Where?

123
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:24,236
To surgery. To see
the butchering.

124
00:20:24,344 --> 00:20:26,972
He doesn't butcher people,
he fixes them.

125
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:31,449
He does tits and noses for money
but he prefers the other stuff.

126
00:20:31,584 --> 00:20:34,747
- Such as?
- I don't know, deformities...

127
00:20:34,854 --> 00:20:36,583
Guys born with eleven fingers.

128
00:20:36,689 --> 00:20:39,920
- My dad takes off the extra one.
- And eats it.

129
00:20:40,026 --> 00:20:42,017
I'm serious. It's not a joke.

130
00:20:42,128 --> 00:20:45,359
You said he didn't butcher bodies.

131
00:20:45,465 --> 00:20:47,592
Nevermind. You don't get it.

132
00:21:31,043 --> 00:21:33,341
Do you like your parents?

133
00:21:34,514 --> 00:21:36,414
They're my parents.

134
00:21:36,716 --> 00:21:39,514
So? Do you like them?

135
00:21:40,153 --> 00:21:42,348
I guess so.

136
00:21:45,024 --> 00:21:46,855
Thanks.

137
00:21:50,096 --> 00:21:53,623
I feel sorry for mine.
They're always waiting.

138
00:21:59,539 --> 00:22:03,805
- Why did you hit him?
- He had it coming.

139
00:22:06,712 --> 00:22:09,613
- Do you take Argentine pesos?
- Yes.

140
00:22:09,715 --> 00:22:12,684
- How much is it?
- 7 pesos.

141
00:22:12,785 --> 00:22:14,252
He pays.

142
00:22:25,465 --> 00:22:27,126
Here you are.

143
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:32,995
- Enjoy it.
- Thanks.

144
00:22:57,697 --> 00:22:59,688
When you listen to music in the street..

145
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:00,493
What?

146
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,068
Everyone seems to be listening
to the same tune.

147
00:24:46,639 --> 00:24:49,267
- Whats up?
- Here's a present.

148
00:24:49,442 --> 00:24:51,410
- For me?
- Yes.

149
00:24:53,512 --> 00:24:58,882
Look. It's a tag they put
on the turtles.

150
00:24:59,018 --> 00:25:03,011
- I've got one too.
- What is it for?

151
00:25:03,122 --> 00:25:05,147
To follow their migratory routes.

152
00:25:05,257 --> 00:25:08,192
These two are from the same family.

153
00:25:08,294 --> 00:25:11,491
- Where's this one from?
- África.

154
00:25:11,864 --> 00:25:16,597
Cool. It's cool. Thanks.

155
00:25:17,236 --> 00:25:21,696
- You're not wearing it?
- Maybe later.

156
00:25:21,841 --> 00:25:24,435
You don't like it?

157
00:25:25,578 --> 00:25:29,275
Well, I'm not sure. I'll see.

158
00:25:38,357 --> 00:25:40,848
- Careful with that.
- What is it?

159
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,124
Corticoid.
So I don't grow a beard.

160
00:25:59,311 --> 00:26:02,212
- Good morning.

161
00:26:04,617 --> 00:26:08,109
- Perhaps I can help you.
- With what?

162
00:26:08,287 --> 00:26:10,016
To speak with him.

163
00:26:10,523 --> 00:26:13,014
To explain what we'do to her..

164
00:26:16,095 --> 00:26:18,962
- Shall we go?

165
00:26:21,133 --> 00:26:22,930
We'll be right back.

166
00:27:12,718 --> 00:27:16,415
- What is it?
- A rare species. Don't touch it.

167
00:27:27,066 --> 00:27:29,899
What do you know about
the species in my house?

168
00:27:42,181 --> 00:27:43,773
Stop the car.

169
00:27:50,389 --> 00:27:52,289
I'm sure this was the spot.

170
00:27:53,559 --> 00:27:55,925
This is where I got pregnant
with Alex.

171
00:27:58,397 --> 00:28:01,059
We still lived in Buenos Aires.

172
00:28:54,053 --> 00:28:57,079
I was afraid
somebody would see us.

173
00:28:57,590 --> 00:29:00,684
I was worried somebody
would drive by and see us.

174
00:29:10,035 --> 00:29:13,801
- It's ridiculous.
- What is?

175
00:29:15,174 --> 00:29:18,575
Being worried about
what other people think.

176
00:29:21,013 --> 00:29:23,675
They'd ask:
'Is it a boy or a girl'.

177
00:29:23,782 --> 00:29:27,445
It's the first thing
they ask in the clinic.

178
00:29:29,922 --> 00:29:32,516
When did she stop
the corticoid?

179
00:29:35,594 --> 00:29:38,222
Two weeks ago.

180
00:29:39,899 --> 00:29:42,834
You know what will happen?

181
00:29:47,606 --> 00:29:50,905
- What?
- She'll masculinize.

182
00:29:52,044 --> 00:29:54,638
Everything will change.
Her body, her cycles.

183
00:29:55,414 --> 00:29:58,144
She'll stop developing as a woman.

184
00:30:01,854 --> 00:30:03,048
That's enough.

185
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:23,540
- Have you thought about what I said?
- I'm not having sex with you.

186
00:30:23,676 --> 00:30:26,577
- Why not?
- Because you're too young.

187
00:30:26,679 --> 00:30:30,581
- So what?
- And we've only just met.

188
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:34,042
That's why I'll never fell
for somebody like you.

189
00:30:34,153 --> 00:30:36,053
Not I for you.

190
00:30:39,024 --> 00:30:41,458
You say you're older than me
but you repeat every word I say...

191
00:30:45,397 --> 00:30:49,766
You're not normal.
You're different and you know it.

192
00:30:49,935 --> 00:30:52,062
Why do people stare at you?

193
00:30:53,973 --> 00:30:56,498
Why? What's wrong with you?

194
00:32:00,939 --> 00:32:03,032
Stay.

195
00:32:05,911 --> 00:32:08,141
Come here.

196
00:32:37,076 --> 00:32:40,011
- I don't have anything.
- I like it.

197
00:36:20,799 --> 00:36:24,098
Sex Change For Boy Authorised

198
00:36:24,269 --> 00:36:28,467
At 18, Scherer Starts the Journey
From Woman to Man

199
00:36:30,609 --> 00:36:32,941
We can start if you want.

200
00:36:34,613 --> 00:36:36,547
What about the children?

201
00:36:39,084 --> 00:36:40,949
Álvaro?

202
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:43,144
He must be with Alex.

203
00:36:43,455 --> 00:36:45,013
Alex.

204
00:36:46,425 --> 00:36:48,359
Sweetheart.

205
00:37:32,871 --> 00:37:37,308
- Here he is. What happened?
- It's pouring.

206
00:37:37,409 --> 00:37:39,434
Poor darling.

207
00:37:42,714 --> 00:37:45,080
Get changed and come eat.

208
00:38:20,419 --> 00:38:22,580
- What's wrong?
- Nothin'.

209
00:38:22,687 --> 00:38:24,621
Give me your plate?

210
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:27,918
Nothin'? What's nothin'?

211
00:38:28,093 --> 00:38:31,654
- Leave him alone.
- I want to know what's wrong.

212
00:38:32,631 --> 00:38:34,292
Sorry I'm late.

213
00:38:43,542 --> 00:38:47,069
- Alex?
- She's not feeling well.

214
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:55,652
- Anything wrong?
- Nothing.

215
00:38:57,489 --> 00:38:59,889
- Can I see?
- Yes.

216
00:39:02,427 --> 00:39:06,329
- See how well my son drows.

217
00:39:14,206 --> 00:39:17,505
I don't drink.
Tonight you will. You're old enough.

218
00:39:17,609 --> 00:39:19,509
Ramiro!

219
00:39:21,813 --> 00:39:24,008
It wont hurt him

220
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:29,752
Drink up

221
00:39:29,855 --> 00:39:31,846
Don't drink, if you don't want to.

222
00:39:31,957 --> 00:39:33,117
- It's not a big deal.

223
00:39:33,225 --> 00:39:35,420
- Yes, it is a big deal.

224
00:39:35,527 --> 00:39:38,724
- It's not.
- Yes it is.

225
00:39:38,864 --> 00:39:42,664
We moved to be away from
certain kinds of people.

226
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:48,367
And now we're all sitting
round the same table.

227
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:13,725
O yes... Give it to me baby.
Take this and this.

228
00:40:15,967 --> 00:40:18,435
Again, again.

229
00:40:18,537 --> 00:40:23,236
- You've done it already.
- How d'you know?

230
00:40:23,341 --> 00:40:25,434
I can tell.

231
00:40:29,047 --> 00:40:30,514
With my cousin.

232
00:40:30,682 --> 00:40:32,309
Five times.

233
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:34,145
I didn't want to at first.

234
00:40:34,252 --> 00:40:36,186
I didn't like it.

235
00:40:36,354 --> 00:40:39,915
He said we weren't going all the way.
Just half way.

236
00:40:40,058 --> 00:40:42,390
We ended up going all the way

237
00:40:42,627 --> 00:40:44,254
It didn't hurt much.

238
00:40:51,536 --> 00:40:53,333
Put this on Alex.

239
00:41:08,353 --> 00:41:12,517
I'll put the spare matress here.
On the floor.

240
00:41:12,657 --> 00:41:14,648
Or Alex goes home.

241
00:41:18,363 --> 00:41:20,524
Go to sleep, it's late.

242
00:41:23,568 --> 00:41:25,433
Give it to me baby...

243
00:41:33,445 --> 00:41:35,936
I have a special bottle of liquor.

244
00:41:36,982 --> 00:41:38,711
I'm going to bed.

245
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,319
We're all going to bed.

246
00:41:43,421 --> 00:41:45,218
Don't. I'll be right back.

247
00:41:56,267 --> 00:41:59,759
- What's the matter?
- I found them together.

248
00:41:59,871 --> 00:42:03,568
- Who?
- Alex and Álvaro.

249
00:42:03,742 --> 00:42:07,610
- What do you mean?
- Together.

250
00:42:07,846 --> 00:42:12,749
- Doing what?
- Don't know, I walked away... On top

251
00:42:12,917 --> 00:42:15,283
- What?
- She was on top.

252
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:16,478
I don't understand.

253
00:42:16,588 --> 00:42:21,150
She was fucking the boy up the ass.
Clear enough?

254
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:33,365
It was bound to happen.

255
00:42:33,471 --> 00:42:35,530
That's enough, Kraken.

256
00:42:41,513 --> 00:42:43,913
We knew this would happen.

257
00:42:46,284 --> 00:42:48,718
She can't stay a woman.

258
00:42:53,191 --> 00:42:54,556
What do you mean 'normal'?

259
00:42:54,693 --> 00:42:56,092
- What?
- You said normal.

260
00:42:56,194 --> 00:42:58,321
I didn't say anything.

261
00:43:01,533 --> 00:43:03,763
Don't build your hopes up.

262
00:43:06,171 --> 00:43:08,765
She'll never be a woman,

263
00:43:09,674 --> 00:43:12,700
even if a surgeon cuts off
what she doesn't need.

264
00:43:14,312 --> 00:43:18,009
When did you tell them?
That's why they're here?

265
00:43:18,116 --> 00:43:21,449
I just wanted them to meet her.

266
00:43:21,653 --> 00:43:23,883
I'm not crazy.

267
00:43:25,623 --> 00:43:28,023
You talk to him.

268
00:43:34,165 --> 00:43:36,429
What if she wants to?

269
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:23,761
Sorry.

270
00:47:00,738 --> 00:47:05,004
- What do you want? Are you a doctor?
- No.

271
00:47:05,109 --> 00:47:07,009
A journalist?

272
00:47:10,481 --> 00:47:14,941
I have a daughter. A son...

273
00:47:20,471 --> 00:47:24,703
I've seen you before.
You've been here before, right?

274
00:47:25,209 --> 00:47:26,608
Yes.

275
00:47:37,655 --> 00:47:42,115
I don't usually drink but
it will do us both good.

276
00:47:50,301 --> 00:47:52,496
Your son?

277
00:47:55,473 --> 00:47:57,873
Adopted.

278
00:47:58,676 --> 00:48:01,770
We're doing the paperwork
to adopt a girl.

279
00:48:01,912 --> 00:48:03,812
The perfect family.

280
00:48:10,655 --> 00:48:13,954
- How old is Alex?
- 15.

281
00:48:17,094 --> 00:48:19,722
Want to see me at her age?

282
00:48:23,868 --> 00:48:25,927
If you don't mind...

283
00:48:52,997 --> 00:48:56,330
That's me at 12.

284
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:00,794
Keep it.

285
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:03,133
Give it to Alex.

286
00:49:08,813 --> 00:49:13,147
- Did you always know?
- That I wasn't a woman?

287
00:49:15,252 --> 00:49:20,280
I still wonder how my life
would've been without the operation.

288
00:49:20,891 --> 00:49:25,885
How was your transformation
from man to woman ?

289
00:49:27,498 --> 00:49:32,993
When I was 16 I started
taking testosterone

290
00:49:33,104 --> 00:49:34,435
At 17 I had surgery.

291
00:49:34,538 --> 00:49:38,440
That same year I changed my name...

292
00:49:38,542 --> 00:49:41,511
I met my wife six months later.

293
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:45,708
The rest of my life
is sleeping in that bed.

294
00:49:52,323 --> 00:49:54,791
What if I got it all wrong?

295
00:49:54,925 --> 00:49:57,223
By letting her choose?

296
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:02,758
Do you know what my
earliest memories are?

297
00:50:02,933 --> 00:50:05,493
Medical examinations.

298
00:50:05,970 --> 00:50:10,236
I thought I was so horrible
when I was born

299
00:50:10,374 --> 00:50:15,107
that I had to have five operations
before my first birthday.

300
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:18,771
That's what they call 'normalization'.

301
00:50:18,916 --> 00:50:22,977
It's not surgery. It's castration.

302
00:50:27,424 --> 00:50:30,552
Making her afraid of her own body..

303
00:50:30,661 --> 00:50:33,129
is the worst thing
you can do to your child.

304
00:51:13,604 --> 00:51:15,731
What are you doing?

305
00:54:20,124 --> 00:54:25,528
- You're looking at me differently.
- You're older.

306
00:54:35,172 --> 00:54:39,108
Then you could've told me
why these people came to visit.

307
00:54:39,243 --> 00:54:41,734
I didn't know.

308
00:54:56,160 --> 00:55:00,290
- Are you coming with me?
- No, I want to walk for a while.

309
00:57:05,022 --> 00:57:06,387
<i>Alex!</i>

310
00:57:21,138 --> 00:57:22,799
Alex.

311
00:57:25,175 --> 00:57:27,473
I don't understand.

312
00:57:29,046 --> 00:57:32,277
- You're not?
- I'm both.

313
00:57:34,952 --> 00:57:36,613
But that's impossible.

314
00:57:36,753 --> 00:57:40,450
You tell me what is and isn't possible?

315
00:57:42,059 --> 00:57:45,460
But do you like boys or girls?

316
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:48,598
I don't know.

317
00:58:01,511 --> 00:58:03,843
Sorry about what I did to you.

318
00:58:04,848 --> 00:58:14,553
You didn't do anything.
I'm not upset... I liked it.

319
00:58:14,758 --> 00:58:19,286
- Really?
- Yes.

320
00:58:20,697 --> 00:58:25,225
- So did I.
- You did?

321
00:58:30,274 --> 00:58:34,404
- Then let's finish it.
- Never with you!

322
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:37,344
- Why?
- I want something else.

323
00:58:37,948 --> 00:58:42,715
- I want something else too.
- Oh, yeah? What do you want?

324
00:58:44,655 --> 00:58:46,885
What do you want?

325
00:58:49,593 --> 00:58:52,084
- Alex, it'll be our secret.
- Liar.

326
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:53,958
- I wont tell anybody.
- Get off.

327
00:58:54,064 --> 00:58:57,056
Go tell everybody I'm a monster!

328
00:58:57,434 --> 00:58:58,696
<i>Alex!</i>

329
00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:32,126
Where's Alex?

330
00:59:32,269 --> 00:59:34,635
What are you doing here?
I told you not to come here.

331
00:59:34,738 --> 00:59:37,605
- Where is she?
- Beat it, Vando.

332
00:59:37,741 --> 00:59:40,437
Your father's in real trouble.

333
00:59:58,929 --> 01:00:05,129


334
01:00:16,947 --> 01:00:18,437
Alex!

335
01:00:18,582 --> 01:00:20,345
<i>Alex!</i>

336
01:00:22,352 --> 01:00:25,879
<i>Wait up</i>

337
01:00:30,894 --> 01:00:33,158
Wait, wait.

338
01:00:33,764 --> 01:00:35,595
Come on

339
01:00:38,335 --> 01:00:40,599
Come on over here.

340
01:00:42,706 --> 01:00:45,038
Don't worry.

341
01:00:45,776 --> 01:00:48,609
Calm down.

342
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:51,905
We're not going to hurt you.

343
01:01:02,526 --> 01:01:03,458
Take it easy.

344
01:01:06,363 --> 01:01:07,762
Please!

345
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:14,599
Quiet. We're not gonna hurt you.

346
01:01:14,704 --> 01:01:16,729
Calm down

347
01:01:20,243 --> 01:01:22,370
Let me go! Please!

348
01:01:29,219 --> 01:01:31,312
Bitch!

349
01:01:32,456 --> 01:01:36,825
Take it easy, stay still!

350
01:01:38,995 --> 01:01:40,826
Take it easy.

351
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:47,936
- Please let me go.
- It's alright, I just want to see.

352
01:01:48,238 --> 01:01:49,535
Let me see.

353
01:01:50,841 --> 01:01:54,868
Let me see what you've got
down there

354
01:01:55,278 --> 01:01:59,510
What have you got?

355
01:02:05,922 --> 01:02:08,390
We're not hurting you

356
01:02:11,962 --> 01:02:13,361
It's a prick.

357
01:02:13,497 --> 01:02:16,398
- No way.
- She's got both!

358
01:02:22,205 --> 01:02:24,196
She's got both.

359
01:02:24,341 --> 01:02:27,242
- It's gross.
- No way, it's great.

360
01:02:27,377 --> 01:02:29,709
Do you get hard?
Let me see.

361
01:02:29,813 --> 01:02:31,303
Do you get hard?

362
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:38,216
Answer him. Do you get hard?

363
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:42,588
I want to see if it works.

364
01:02:42,859 --> 01:02:44,520
Let go of her!

365
01:02:44,694 --> 01:02:47,162
Get out of here, asshole!

366
01:02:47,564 --> 01:02:50,397
- We didn't do anything.
- Beat it!

367
01:02:52,702 --> 01:02:54,863
Beat it!

368
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:45,918
- Does it hurt?
- No.

369
01:03:46,089 --> 01:03:49,456
- Did they hurt you elsewhere?
- No!

370
01:03:49,593 --> 01:03:52,460
- I'll take her to the hospital.
- I don't want anyone to touch her.

371
01:03:52,562 --> 01:03:56,089
- Calm down. It'll be alright.
- It won't be alright?

372
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:14,207
Come here.
Let me go!

373
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:17,279
Stay away from my daughter?

374
01:05:18,081 --> 01:05:21,710
- Enough. You'll kill him.
- Enough? You say it's enough?

375
01:05:21,885 --> 01:05:24,285
You're just like them. Worse!

376
01:05:24,421 --> 01:05:26,889
Stay away from my son...

377
01:06:05,161 --> 01:06:08,392
Just agree to the surgery.
It's not too late.

378
01:06:08,531 --> 01:06:11,728
You can't hide her
for the rest of her life.

379
01:06:12,068 --> 01:06:14,161
Hide her?

380
01:06:17,774 --> 01:06:21,266
- You think she's a freak?
- No!

381
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:34,484
We came here to stop hearing
every idiot's opinion.

382
01:06:57,814 --> 01:06:59,714
I've had enough.

383
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:02,818
I've had enough pills...

384
01:07:02,919 --> 01:07:05,888
enough operations.

385
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:08,547
I want things to stay the same.

386
01:08:35,078 --> 01:08:37,808
She was diagnosed 2 months
before being born.

387
01:08:38,281 --> 01:08:41,375
They wanted to film the birth.

388
01:08:42,185 --> 01:08:47,122
For 'medical interest', and to present
the case to the ethics council.

389
01:08:47,357 --> 01:08:49,587
We said no, to all of it.

390
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:52,050
Alex was born blue...

391
01:08:52,195 --> 01:08:54,857
She took 40 seconds to start breathing.

392
01:08:57,734 --> 01:08:59,702
Then, they wanted to operate.

393
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:02,293
they said the only after-effect...

394
01:09:02,438 --> 01:09:04,906
would be the scar.

395
01:09:08,111 --> 01:09:10,409
Suli was scarred.

396
01:09:11,714 --> 01:09:14,740
I convinced her not to do anything.

397
01:09:15,051 --> 01:09:17,178
She was perfect...

398
01:09:18,688 --> 01:09:21,088
From the moment I set eyes on her.

399
01:09:22,125 --> 01:09:24,116
Perfect.

400
01:11:20,777 --> 01:11:25,510
Forget her.
She's too much for you.

401
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:13,085
I can't leave yet.

402
01:12:19,035 --> 01:12:20,764
I want to speak to him.

403
01:12:23,573 --> 01:12:25,336
We have to leave.

404
01:12:26,843 --> 01:12:29,334
Go fetch your son.

405
01:13:00,877 --> 01:13:03,107
You'll catch a cold.

406
01:13:10,353 --> 01:13:13,481
- May I?
- Yes.

407
01:13:24,033 --> 01:13:28,970
- I thought you didn't drink?
- You told me I have to drink.

408
01:13:40,850 --> 01:13:46,152
- Do you like me?
- You're my son.

409
01:13:46,455 --> 01:13:49,618
Let's cut the crap
and talk seriously.

410
01:13:53,129 --> 01:13:55,222
Kind of.

411
01:14:02,405 --> 01:14:04,737
What about me? Do you like me?

412
01:14:06,475 --> 01:14:08,466
Do you like what I do?

413
01:14:08,578 --> 01:14:11,979
I'd give anything
to have your talent.

414
01:14:21,224 --> 01:14:24,193
And.. Me.. am I talented?

415
01:14:27,496 --> 01:14:29,293
No.

416
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:32,895
Maybe...

417
01:14:33,069 --> 01:14:37,563
Do you think one day?

418
01:14:37,673 --> 01:14:42,736
Do you think that I...
No, I don't.

419
01:14:44,046 --> 01:14:49,575
I don't get it.
It wasn't always this way.

420
01:14:49,752 --> 01:14:54,883
- What way?
- When did I stop interesting you?

421
01:14:58,261 --> 01:15:00,729
It was a bad idea to come.

422
01:15:01,464 --> 01:15:03,295
Your mother is right.
We're leaving

423
01:15:03,399 --> 01:15:06,027
- When?
- Now. At dawn.

424
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:10,696
- No. I can't leave yet.
- Why not?

425
01:15:13,276 --> 01:15:15,904
Do you like Alex?

426
01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:19,644
Finally good news.

427
01:15:21,217 --> 01:15:23,742
I was afraid you were a fag.

428
01:15:57,053 --> 01:15:59,317
What are you doing?

429
01:16:01,457 --> 01:16:03,516
Looking after you.

430
01:16:06,929 --> 01:16:09,921
You can't look after me for ever.

431
01:16:14,036 --> 01:16:16,436
Until you can choose.

432
01:16:16,839 --> 01:16:20,605
- What?
- Whatever you want.

433
01:16:39,161 --> 01:16:41,789
What if there isn't
a decision to make?

434
01:17:00,116 --> 01:17:02,141
I've finished it.

435
01:17:15,731 --> 01:17:21,499
- Did they hurt you?
- No.

436
01:17:35,284 --> 01:17:38,253
Did you go to the police?

437
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:45,222
No, that's your decision.

438
01:17:45,728 --> 01:17:52,793
We'll press charges if you want,
but it's your decision.

439
01:18:04,613 --> 01:18:07,844
Everybody'll find out.

440
01:18:13,856 --> 01:18:16,620
Let them.

441
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:14,006
- Have a good trip.
- Thanks.

442
01:20:18,447 --> 01:20:20,312
I'll be right back.

443
01:20:58,554 --> 01:21:01,318
Will I see you again?

444
01:21:02,024 --> 01:21:04,356
I don't think so.

445
01:21:08,764 --> 01:21:10,356
Look.

446
01:21:24,747 --> 01:21:28,683
I never imagined I'd fall
for someone like you.

447
01:21:29,485 --> 01:21:31,612
But it happened.

448
01:21:34,923 --> 01:21:39,257
- Me too.
- No.

449
01:21:39,495 --> 01:21:41,486
No?

450
01:21:43,098 --> 01:21:45,794
You're after something else.

451
01:21:46,802 --> 01:21:48,827
No.

452
01:21:58,747 --> 01:22:00,374
What do you regret the most?

453
01:22:00,516 --> 01:22:02,984
Not seeing me again
or not having seen it?

454
01:22:03,118 --> 01:22:05,143
<i>Álvaro!</i>

455
01:22:17,232 --> 01:22:19,166
Do you want to see?

456
01:22:36,251 --> 01:22:38,310
<i>Álvaro!</i>

457
01:22:44,993 --> 01:22:47,928
Hurry up, we'll miss the boat.
