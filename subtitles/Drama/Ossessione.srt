1
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:34,121
Gas! I need gas!

2
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:57,879
Signor Bregana, I need gas!

3
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:14,695
My truck's engine is busted

4
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,269
and nobody wants to stop and take a look.

5
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:21,306
Are you in that much of hurry ?

6
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:23,841
I wake up in the morning and here we are.

7
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:25,672
The night before, I go to bed--

8
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:28,645
toot, toot, toot... and now here you are.

9
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:31,546
And this one ?
Who is he ?

10
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:35,052
Hey, you, get down!

11
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:43,691
It must be uncomfortable traveling in the back.

12
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:46,560
Maybe we should set up a mattress for bums.

13
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:47,860
Let's go. Hurry up.

14
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:52,097
You have to be careful.
Those guys could rob you naked.

15
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:58,238
- What do you want ?
- Fill it up.

16
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:03,874
Hey, Bregana.

17
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:25,198
- Hey, Bregana.
- No, not here yet.

18
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:27,933
Stay ! Sit !

19
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:40,981
. . .three, four, six, four, six.

20
00:03:57,837 --> 00:04:00,499
Do you serve food here ?

21
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:07,804
I'm asking if you serve food here.

22
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:14,679
- Look, I'll pay for it.
- Okay, but in the other room.

23
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:17,346
Wait, I'll bring it to you in the other room.

24
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:21,316
it's good.

25
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,622
Do you have anything to do with that potbelly outside ?

26
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,721
He's my husband.

27
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:29,768
He's lucky to have a woman like you,

28
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:32,133
one that cooks so well.

29
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:34,672
You're exaggerating.

30
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:38,906
I am not a cook.

31
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,882
Wait for me there.

32
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:54,688
It's hot in here, by the stove.

33
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:57,456
You're built like a horse.

34
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:03,395
What's a little heat to you ?

35
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:06,267
Giovanna ?

36
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:12,709
We've caught a chicken thief hiding on a truck.

37
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:16,509
He must still be around here.

38
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:18,982
You never know what those guys are up to.

39
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:21,451
Why have you stopped eating ?

40
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:24,785
He may try something.
You hear so many things these days.

41
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:30,659
Here, it's even in the paper.

42
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:32,822
I hope...

43
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:35,230
Just the one I was looking for.

44
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,496
Who told you could come into the kitchen ?

45
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:41,471
Are you crazy ?
He could even steal the dishes.

46
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:45,401
Let's go, boy.

47
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:49,606
Thank goodness my brain still works.

48
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:06,992
Well, princess, you do your nails every day

49
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,331
and let my house go.

50
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:12,836
Don't get mad at me.
You're really smart.

51
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:14,736
You talk and talk and let him go without paying.

52
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:17,173
- Without paying ?
- Yes. Without paying.

53
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:19,767
- Why didn't you say so before ?
- Because--

54
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,744
I'll take care of him.

55
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:28,810
Hey ! You !
Wait a minute !

56
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:35,154
I told you, nobody can fool me.

57
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:36,922
Where you come from, do you eat without paying ?

58
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:39,122
- What are you saying ?
- Don't play dumb.

59
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,099
You didn't pay. The wife said so.

60
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:46,331
- Your wife told you that ?
- Yes.

61
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,202
That's a good story.

62
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:53,677
No need to repeat myself. Go ahead.
Move it. Empty those pockets.

63
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,543
What's this, then ?

64
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:58,344
- I haven't got a penny left.
- Think I'm gullible ?

65
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:00,783
You ate and you've got to pay one way or another.

66
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:04,379
- Then I'll give you my stuff.
- What would I do with it ?

67
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,720
if that's how you feel,

68
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:09,420
we'll find something else.

69
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:12,498
What do you want to find ?
Come on. Pay up.

70
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:15,032
- I heard your truck broke down.
- So, what's that to you ?

71
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:17,227
- I'm a mechanic.
- So ?

72
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:18,894
So, let's go take a look.

73
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:22,634
You think you can cheat me ?
If so, you'll pay for it.

74
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:24,869
It's written on your face that you're a good man.

75
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:27,377
What were you doing on that truck ?
Where did you want to go ?

76
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,143
- I'm out of work.
- You're not really a bum, are you ?

77
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,845
I like to travel. Rich people travel by train.

78
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:38,788
- l get by.
- You get by ?

79
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:47,122
- Hey, Bregana, you're late today.
- You can see I'm busy.

80
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,497
Then we'll take care of it ourselves.

81
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:09,643
Here are the chickens.
Always picking at my tires.

82
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:15,521
You also like working in the dark, don't you ?

83
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:21,428
Come on.

84
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:24,560
Let's go. Here it is.

85
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,865
Now let's see what you can do.

86
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:29,168
We need to run it to hear how it sounds.

87
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:31,573
Okay, let's do it.

88
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:43,216
Are you dropping parts as you go ?
No wonder it runs bad.

89
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:48,419
We need a new rotor.
Is there a place nearby to get it ?

90
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,190
The closest place is in Codigoro.

91
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:54,289
I could go by myself if l knew my way around here.

92
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:59,201
Not a chance! I'll call.
It's one hour away by bicycle.

93
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:03,605
Also, the pump sticks a little.

94
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:07,372
You know, it's hard getting a mechanic just for that.

95
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,971
- Since you're already here...
- Yes, I'll take care of it.

96
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:12,312
- Half a day and it will be running.
- Yes ?

97
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:15,353
Then take the tools and let's go.

98
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:20,619
- Hey, were you a bersagliere ?
- Sure. in the Sixth Regiment.

99
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,998
Me, too. I spent 18 months as bersagliere.

100
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:31,627
You too7 What a coincidence.
Sixth Regiment ?

101
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,705
That's the one for the best.

102
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:36,934
Actually, Riva the Marshal used to say the Fourth was the best.

103
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:39,409
You mean Sergeant Riva.
You met him too ?

104
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:44,916
''Study war tactics and you'll reap the reward.''

105
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:47,576
- Hello, Father Remigio.
- Good morning, Bregana.

106
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:49,746
Do you want to arm wrestle again ?

107
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:52,153
No, some other time.

108
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:58,128
If Santa Lucia guides my aim,
I want to pepper a dozen ducks.

109
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,631
- Hey, Giovanna, I'm off to Codigoro.
- Codigoro ?

110
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:04,464
Yes. Something urgent.

111
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:21,849
Hello, hello. . .
Is this the shop ?

112
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,479
I need a rotor.

113
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:29,027
Could you send it right away ?
To Bregana at the Dogana.

114
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,686
Are you hungry now ?

115
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:36,063
Then it's impossible for tonight.
Can't you find someone to bring it ?

116
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:40,263
Yes, but I'm out of money.
I can't pay you.

117
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:42,898
I understand. That's fine.

118
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:47,973
Come, Ferruccio, would you like to go
pick up a part for my truck ?

119
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,447
- I'm sorry, I can't go.
- Come with me. We'll go together.

120
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,950
Very well. Give me five minutes.

121
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:57,420
Giovanna, bring my coat and hat.

122
00:10:57,523 --> 00:10:59,889
It was good of you to drop by.

123
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:03,450
At least I'll be able to give you news
you'll be interested in.

124
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:07,123
Is that right ?
Well.

125
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:09,565
I'll be back in an hour.

126
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:13,537
- Bring me the bicycle.
- Doesn't he go too ?

127
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:16,107
He's the mechanic.
He's going to fix the truck.

128
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:17,835
A mechanic ?

129
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:23,609
Yes, what's so strange about that ?
He looked and knew right away.

130
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:26,378
Why do you always
do things your own way ?

131
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:30,148
It's my house. I'm the boss.
Understand ?

132
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:32,383
- Good morning, Signora Giovanna.
- Let's go, Father.

133
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:34,482
- Where are you from ?
- Senigallia.

134
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:37,460
Ah, Senigallia.
Half saints, half crooks.

135
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:43,167
In the meantime, work on that pump.

136
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:45,430
- I'll expect you to be done.
- Don't worry.

137
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,701
- Let's go, Father.
- Let's go.

138
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:37,136
But you really don't know the news ?

139
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:39,143
- I'm telling you.
- Come now, l know you.

140
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:44,080
I'm going to tell you.
Those fellows are serious.

141
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:47,949
They caught a 10-pound yellow eel.
They will put it in the paper.

142
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:51,113
Unreal! Why didn't you say so before ?

143
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,714
10 pounds!

144
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:56,795
- Where did they cast the net ?
- l don't know.

145
00:14:56,896 --> 00:15:00,263
I meant to ask you.
That's why l stopped by at the store.

146
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:03,130
Let's go first to set things up
for tomorrow morning.

147
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,931
Let's see if there's any good hunting in the marsh.

148
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:08,131
And the part for the truck ?

149
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,765
I'll pick it up on the way back.
First I want to find out. . .

150
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:13,106
oh-- here comes the ferry.

151
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:37,063
Really ? 10 pounds ?

152
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:40,468
I'll bet you they caught it in the Eden Valley.

153
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,683
When did you notice I liked you ?

154
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,186
Right away.

155
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,552
When I asked for something to eat...

156
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,888
and you didn't answer.

157
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:12,768
Now you'll never leave me, right ?

158
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:21,804
Not even to go back on the road ?

159
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:31,016
No.

160
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:35,890
Perhaps I was wrong about you.

161
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,623
You'll go boasting to everybody.

162
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:41,359
Some things I keep inside.

163
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:47,363
You're the first woman I've been with in a long time.

164
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:52,273
I didn't have much of a social life in the last few months--

165
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:57,247
longshoreman in Trieste, mechanic when I found work.

166
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:02,549
So who could I tell about this ?

167
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:06,522
I don't know anybody around here.

168
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,594
Then...

169
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,129
We'll get along.

170
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:19,832
How come he's not back yet ?

171
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:28,913
He's always like this.
He always says he'll be right back.

172
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:33,041
Maybe he is with the priest.

173
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:39,380
Why did you marry the old man ?
You never told me.

174
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:48,099
I don't even know myself.
I was foolish.

175
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:59,238
When I met him all proper-looking,

176
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:01,778
I didn't have a job.

177
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,077
I was letting people ask me out.
People just passing by.

178
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:12,055
You don't know what it's like being without any money, on the street--

179
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:15,285
not knowing what to do.

180
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:17,294
And then... ?

181
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:21,958
Do you understand ?
It means being asked out by men.

182
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:31,840
Yes, I understand.

183
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,845
I thought I could be safe with him,

184
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,415
but it's worse than before.

185
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:44,385
It's impossible, you see ?
To live like this-- dirty, fake.

186
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,015
What do I care about his money,

187
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:51,996
If I have to work here in the kitchen ?

188
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:04,673
Do I look like a cook to you ?

189
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:08,678
You deserve to be a lady.

190
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:17,788
You understand, don't you ?

191
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,484
With you I don't need to lie.

192
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:26,461
You're young.

193
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:46,080
You can't know what it's like with an old man.

194
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,710
No, but I can guess.

195
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,182
No-- you can't understand...

196
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:57,421
what it's like for a woman...

197
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:00,896
to live with an old man.

198
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,169
Each time he touches me

199
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:07,830
with those hands of his...

200
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,602
I would like to scream.

201
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,140
I'm no lady.

202
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:21,951
I am just miserable.

203
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,545
I can't stand it anymore.

204
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,536
Listen--

205
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:41,731
What do you say we go away ?
You and me together.

206
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,967
But where ?

207
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,544
Who cares where ?
Wherever we want.

208
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:49,906
No.

209
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:55,282
For me it would mean being propositioned again.

210
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,449
For you, it's different,

211
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:06,862
but for me...
I wish I had at least

212
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:10,162
a place where I could go and live.

213
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,464
No.

214
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:15,335
I'll stay here.

215
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,204
I'll continue to take it.

216
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:23,977
Until...

217
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:27,683
Until ?

218
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,220
Until I don't know when.

219
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:53,574
Tell me--
will you love me... always ?

220
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,376
Yes, Giovanna, I believe so.

221
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:02,519
Enough...

222
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:05,749
not to want anything else ?

223
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:08,257
Yes, Giovanna.

224
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:13,058
Then... something needs to happen...

225
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,099
for us.

226
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:28,112
But you must love me very much.

227
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:29,874
Gino.

228
00:23:06,184 --> 00:23:08,084
Gino ?

229
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:13,647
Hey, Gino.

230
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:15,954
That was a long time.

231
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,222
Here's the part.

232
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,355
Did you fix the pump ?

233
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:23,832
Yes. it works.

234
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:26,733
Now you can fix it ?

235
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,564
Here, it's done.

236
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:38,747
It runs real well !

237
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:41,978
You did a good job !

238
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:45,181
Now where are you going ?

239
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:48,258
- Listen, Signor Bregana--
- What is it ?

240
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,227
I did the job, now we're even.

241
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:54,787
But now, I would like to ask for something.

242
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:59,132
I have no place to go.
If you need something else done. . .

243
00:23:59,237 --> 00:24:01,467
That is, if you could put me up for a few more days.

244
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:03,871
Huh ! Got tired of wandering around ?

245
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:05,670
I won't give you any trouble.

246
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:08,678
Actually, I don't need any help.

247
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:12,477
But if we don't help each other, between us ex-bersaglieri. . .

248
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:17,146
hey, I'll give you food and drink, then we'll see what happens.

249
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:18,119
Okay.

250
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:21,715
Now, you can borrow my razor and clean up your face.

251
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:30,290
Giovanna ?

252
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:32,427
Giovanna.

253
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:37,399
Oh, you're here.

254
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:39,602
Why didn't you answer ?

255
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,207
Give me a kiss.

256
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,580
Can't you see someone is looking ?

257
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:48,983
Don't act like this in front of strangers.

258
00:24:50,088 --> 00:24:51,646
He's not a kid.

259
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:54,315
He knows what goes on between a man and his wife.

260
00:24:56,194 --> 00:24:59,823
Besides, he's no stranger.
It's Gino.

261
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:02,422
Didn't I tell you ?
He'll stay here a few days.

262
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:05,264
With us ?

263
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,429
Yes, with us.

264
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:13,136
It's a pity for a mechanic like him to wear out his shoes on the road.

265
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:19,776
Here, Gino.
Go shave yourself.

266
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:25,118
Go ahead. Help me dry out.

267
00:25:25,223 --> 00:25:27,714
It's hot today.

268
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:30,556
There is a storm in the air.

269
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:32,687
It would be good if it rained.

270
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:36,729
Did you get the chickens inside ?

271
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,967
How hot it is.

272
00:25:43,141 --> 00:25:46,941
Harder.

273
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:50,481
Good. Scratch there a little bit.

274
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:54,382
See, Gino ?
These are the pleasures of being married.

275
00:25:54,486 --> 00:26:00,220
There is no other way.
You have to get married.

276
00:26:01,126 --> 00:26:05,495
- You made up your mind a little late.
- A little late, but I'm not sorry.

277
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:08,623
You only think of yourself-- as if I didn't exist.

278
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:12,169
Don't worry, I've taken care of you too.

279
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,500
I have a document in here. . .

280
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:18,440
When the time is right, it will take care of you.

281
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:20,773
That's all. I know what I'm doing.

282
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:23,507
A document ?

283
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:29,685
Who knows what kind of mess you've gotten into.

284
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:32,018
A "mess", she calls it !

285
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:34,557
As they say...

286
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:40,559
"The wise person makes the relatives happy."

287
00:26:40,665 --> 00:26:43,099
Meanwhile, let's make sure everything is ready.

288
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:45,169
Tomorrow at sunrise I'm going fishing.

289
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:48,569
Do you want to come along ?

290
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:53,201
I'd rather stay here.
I don't like fishing.

291
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:55,836
Your loss !

292
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:18,334
That cat sounds like it's being tortured.

293
00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:22,805
Because the storm is coming.
It'll break overnight.

294
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:25,034
Let's hope.
I can't breathe.

295
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:27,168
Why don't you take off your shirt ?

296
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:29,678
Because he's here.

297
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:31,180
Where did he go ?

298
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:33,773
I don't know.
I'm not watching over him.

299
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,949
So, you're still mad at him.

300
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:43,960
- It is the heat. it gets to me.
- The heat. That's it.

301
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:47,723
Gino ?

302
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:50,232
Gino !

303
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:54,734
Gino !

304
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:57,501
Gino !

305
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:08,045
I'm here.

306
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,745
What are you doing ?
Here, get something to eat.

307
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:22,729
It is going to rain soon.

308
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:28,702
What have you done ?
There's a ton of pepper in it.

309
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:32,038
Just what we need with this heat.
You did this on purpose, didn't you ?

310
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:34,043
Idiot.

311
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:36,807
You ought to thank God someone is here just now.

312
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:39,179
Here ! I'm coming !

313
00:28:49,694 --> 00:28:53,289
Look, I'm giving you this charm.
Keep it.

314
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:56,595
This way, with the three of us here, it can't go on.

315
00:28:56,701 --> 00:29:01,070
You're telling me.
I feel the same.

316
00:29:01,172 --> 00:29:04,005
Listen, Giovanna-- leave, with me.

317
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:07,940
That was a truck from Rovigo.

318
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:11,447
The driver was telling me

319
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:14,450
They killed poor Sarfi.

320
00:29:14,552 --> 00:29:16,986
They say it was of one of his workers.

321
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:19,579
Because of his wife.

322
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:24,122
- Did they catch him ?
- No, but they'll find him for sure.

323
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,429
How was he killed ?

324
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:32,299
Shot from behind.
They just found him there.

325
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:34,667
Sometimes you can lose your mind.

326
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:40,173
There go those cats again.

327
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,278
We must close the windows.

328
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:47,942
The wind will blow everything tonight.

329
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,251
Didn't you hear me ?

330
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:54,382
It's all right. I'll take care of the cats.

331
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:54,074
Gino.

332
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:59,248
Wait a moment.

333
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,587
Wait.

334
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:04,992
I can't take it anymore.
I can't continue.

335
00:31:05,096 --> 00:31:08,725
You're tired.
We'll wait for a truck that can take us to the train station.

336
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:13,202
I'm not tired, but I can't continue.

337
00:31:13,304 --> 00:31:15,397
Last night, you made up your mind.

338
00:31:15,506 --> 00:31:17,770
Now we can't go back.

339
00:31:32,757 --> 00:31:35,487
Why can't we go back now ?

340
00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:39,085
He is fishing.
He didn't notice anything.

341
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:42,963
You're out of your mind.
We have to get to the station.

342
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,557
And then ?

343
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:47,502
Then ?
Then we get on the train.

344
00:31:47,605 --> 00:31:49,903
No. it's impossible.

345
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:54,809
I know how these things end up.
I can't tramp around like you.

346
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:58,872
We'll spend the night in a hotel,
and tomorrow we'll look for work.

347
00:31:58,983 --> 00:32:03,443
Didn't you say that anything would be better than being with him ?

348
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:06,284
I was wrong.

349
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:10,318
Giovanna... ?

350
00:32:12,196 --> 00:32:15,097
Come back with me, Gino.

351
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:19,262
With your husband always around ?

352
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:21,861
Come back with me, Gino !

353
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:23,440
Gino !

354
00:32:26,644 --> 00:32:29,545
Gino, think about it.

355
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:50,289
Tickets ! Your tickets, please.

356
00:32:57,108 --> 00:32:59,099
Tickets, ladies and gentlemen.

357
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:06,917
Tickets please, gentlemen.

358
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:11,778
- I don't have a ticket.
- Where are you going ?

359
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:16,953
I don't have a ticket.
And I have no money.

360
00:33:18,963 --> 00:33:20,954
What do you mean ?

361
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:23,727
I don't have a ticket or money to buy one with.

362
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,700
If you want, I can get off at the first station coming up.

363
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:28,966
Don't worry, at the next station I'll get you off this train.

364
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:34,101
What is this ? Why throw an honest person off the train ?

365
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:36,373
You stay out of it.
This is none of your business.

366
00:33:36,481 --> 00:33:40,815
Stop being a bully.
Tell me how much it costs.

367
00:33:40,918 --> 00:33:43,910
I'll pay for his ticket.

368
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:47,253
You'll pay ?
To Ancona, it is over 100 lire, with the fine.

369
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,053
Is that so ?

370
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,960
So it's illegal to pay for a friend ?

371
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:58,699
As you wish.
it is 120 and 50.

372
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:06,237
I don't get paid to make distinctions.

373
00:34:08,846 --> 00:34:10,871
Tickets, gentlemen.

374
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:12,745
Thank you.

375
00:34:24,262 --> 00:34:28,426
Don't worry about it.
We must help each other.

376
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:34,332
How far is Ancona ?

377
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:39,105
Four stops... or five.

378
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:44,504
Ancona has a harbor, doesn't it ?

379
00:34:44,615 --> 00:34:46,207
Do you want to board a ship ?

380
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:49,218
I don't know.

381
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,652
For now, I'll take a look around.

382
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:56,320
And you ?
Why are you going ?

383
00:34:56,427 --> 00:35:01,296
I am an artist.
One day here, one there,

384
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:04,197
wherever I go there is work.

385
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:06,031
I'm coming from Trieste.

386
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:10,665
They call me "Spagnolo".
I worked for a long time in Spain.

387
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:21,108
If you want, you can join me.

388
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:24,017
Two people can do a lot of things together.

389
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:37,157
Why not ?

390
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:51,740
- What are we doing now ?
- Going to look for a room.

391
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:56,082
Tomorrow we'll look for work.

392
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:03,520
Heads-- we'll go left toward the harbor.

393
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:11,762
The room usually costs eight.
With two of you it will be 12.

394
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:23,741
We'll pay tomorrow morning.

395
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,078
Tomorrow ? No way.
Pay now or no room.

396
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,981
Let's not worry about this.

397
00:36:28,085 --> 00:36:30,451
You're a good man.
What about him ?

398
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:33,991
Here's your money.

399
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:46,659
You see, Gino, money can't stand still.

400
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:51,037
In your pockets it gets moldy.

401
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:54,475
Instead, you take a piece, pass it on,

402
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:56,342
and someone else can make a living.

403
00:36:56,447 --> 00:36:59,678
It's the same way all over the country.

404
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:02,514
Don't leave your shoes on, okay ?

405
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,713
Only dead people wear their shoes to bed.

406
00:37:04,822 --> 00:37:07,450
Don't worry.
We aren't going to ruin your sheets.

407
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:09,287
Okay, okay.

408
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:14,359
Are you hungry ?

409
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:19,459
No. Usually when I travel
I don't get hungry.

410
00:37:24,475 --> 00:37:27,638
Besides, these last few days

411
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:30,441
I've been eating regularly.

412
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:42,684
What do you do, sell women's apparel ?

413
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:45,193
Leave that alone.

414
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:47,161
Stay out of my business.

415
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:50,200
Your expression has changed.

416
00:37:57,642 --> 00:38:00,509
- I didn't know you were so involved.
- You talk too much.

417
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:04,980
I'm not talking too much.
Why did you want to beat me up ?

418
00:38:05,082 --> 00:38:08,176
You're right. I'm sorry.

419
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:14,020
I've never met a woman like her before.

420
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:21,498
If you stay with me, I'll show you the streets aren't just for making love.

421
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,591
That would be useless.

422
00:38:25,736 --> 00:38:28,170
I understand what you say--

423
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:31,400
you have so many ideas--

424
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:34,672
things I couldn't even repeat.

425
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,713
You say we need to help each other.

426
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:43,820
You pay the train fare for someone without any money.

427
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:49,554
l only know that without her...

428
00:38:51,195 --> 00:38:53,959
I'll never be happy.

429
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:56,727
Why didn't you bring her with you ?

430
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:59,302
- She didn't want to come.
- That means she doesn't love you.

431
00:38:59,403 --> 00:39:03,134
Yes, she does love me...

432
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:07,209
but she isn't like us.

433
00:39:09,213 --> 00:39:12,341
What do you mean, "not like us" ?

434
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:17,954
She has courage, but not enough to leave everything...

435
00:39:18,055 --> 00:39:21,957
her house... and her husband.

436
00:39:32,603 --> 00:39:35,128
She's afraid of being poor.

437
00:39:38,642 --> 00:39:41,634
You've got to get away, Gino.

438
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:44,340
Go as far as you can.

439
00:39:44,448 --> 00:39:47,440
Leave ?

440
00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:53,446
I need to forget her first.

441
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:04,590
And yet, I know that I want her...

442
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:06,966
no matter what it costs.

443
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:09,801
And if I were to go back,

444
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:14,776
I could not resist her... as I did before.

445
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:22,179
Listen to me. Get on a ship.

446
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:41,561
The sea breeze will clear your mind of these ideas.

447
00:40:41,672 --> 00:40:44,197
You'll feel free again.

448
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:47,602
Free ?

449
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:53,111
Free.

450
00:42:33,918 --> 00:42:36,512
Did you miss your boat ?

451
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:41,252
There will be others.

452
00:43:21,198 --> 00:43:23,325
Shall we go ?

453
00:44:42,913 --> 00:44:46,747
An umbrella turned around like this jumps up and down, flies like a plane.

454
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:50,286
For 50 cents, I'll tell your fortune.

455
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:59,591
Green. A nice color.

456
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:02,666
A strong color, the color of hope.

457
00:45:03,934 --> 00:45:07,734
You're lucky. You'll be a sailor.

458
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:11,001
50 cents. Only 50 cents.

459
00:45:13,077 --> 00:45:16,012
Excuse me. Excuse me.

460
00:45:18,182 --> 00:45:21,640
Not like ones you buy at the store.

461
00:45:21,752 --> 00:45:26,212
It's waterproof.
Look. Take a look. No leaks.

462
00:45:26,323 --> 00:45:29,690
Hold this for me a moment, sir.

463
00:45:29,793 --> 00:45:32,455
Look at the one that you'd buy at the store.

464
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:36,556
Here is the water test. Pour it in.

465
00:45:37,968 --> 00:45:40,698
You see how it comes through ?

466
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:47,639
Look at mine, instead.
Made of steel and horn.

467
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:54,082
And it's yours, not for 50
or even 40, but only 20 lire.

468
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:58,418
Who doesn't have 20 lire nowadays ?

469
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:03,359
I'll be damned !
Excuse me.

470
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:06,156
Excuse me. Thank you.

471
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:11,394
Look who's here !
What a way to leave us.

472
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:14,096
If you weren't happy with us, you could have said so.

473
00:46:14,204 --> 00:46:17,332
What are you doing ?
What's this ?

474
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:19,705
You know, the truck broke down again.

475
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:22,472
I had to take it apart and call a mechanic from Ferrara.

476
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:25,070
If you had been there-- tell him, Giovanna.

477
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:26,877
Tell him what a mess it was.

478
00:46:26,984 --> 00:46:29,418
How are you, Signora Bregana ?

479
00:46:31,355 --> 00:46:33,914
Look at the job you got here in town !

480
00:46:34,024 --> 00:46:37,050
It's tied in the back.

481
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:41,659
Somebody did a real good job.

482
00:46:41,765 --> 00:46:43,426
I'll help you get it off.

483
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:46,901
He deserves to leave it on for life.

484
00:46:47,004 --> 00:46:49,234
You were stupid to leave a place

485
00:46:49,339 --> 00:46:54,299
Where you had food to eat and a bed to sleep in to slave away in town.

486
00:46:54,411 --> 00:46:57,710
Wait a minute.
I'll take care of it by myself.

487
00:46:57,815 --> 00:46:59,146
Balloons. Balloons.

488
00:47:03,387 --> 00:47:06,584
...even the old proverb says so...

489
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:14,523
Please. Take this poster off for a minute.

490
00:47:14,631 --> 00:47:16,792
I need to say hello to a friend.

491
00:47:18,802 --> 00:47:21,464
- A friend ?
- Yes, yes, a friend.

492
00:47:21,572 --> 00:47:24,234
Don't ask questions now.

493
00:47:27,044 --> 00:47:29,569
Hey, wait a minute.

494
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:33,377
Take this.

495
00:47:42,726 --> 00:47:45,752
50 cents! 50 cents!

496
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:49,230
50 cents to tell your fortune!

497
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:07,676
- ...and the store at home.
- We closed for two days.

498
00:48:07,784 --> 00:48:11,083
It did Giovanna some good, too.
She was getting unsettled.

499
00:48:11,188 --> 00:48:17,354
Here we are-- Amici's Bar.
This is where I will sing.

500
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:21,397
The Best Voice Contest.
I'm going to win.

501
00:48:57,134 --> 00:49:00,194
- Hey you-- where are you going ?
- I'm going to sing.

502
00:49:00,304 --> 00:49:02,397
Hurry up, you're late.

503
00:49:17,587 --> 00:49:19,817
I'm Giuseppe Bregana.

504
00:49:19,923 --> 00:49:21,948
I'm singing an aria from "La Traviata".

505
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:24,755
Here you go. Hurry up !

506
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:25,484
You didn't go too far.

507
00:50:27,424 --> 00:50:29,688
If I scared you so much...

508
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:34,122
Why didn't you go farther away ?

509
00:50:41,905 --> 00:50:44,635
Let's not talk about it, Giovanna.

510
00:50:44,741 --> 00:50:47,266
Tell me--

511
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:49,709
did you think about me sometimes ?

512
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:31,243
Why do you want to know ?

513
00:51:31,354 --> 00:51:33,481
Giovanna...

514
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:36,423
I tried to forget you.

515
00:51:36,526 --> 00:51:39,188
But I couldn't do it.

516
00:51:39,296 --> 00:51:42,356
I can't live without you.

517
00:51:43,967 --> 00:51:46,936
Before, the world looked immense.

518
00:51:47,037 --> 00:51:51,167
Now, there is only your store.

519
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:54,300
I've been seeing you in my mind

520
00:51:54,411 --> 00:51:57,346
since you sent me away, alone.

521
00:51:59,149 --> 00:52:04,052
I would have never thought it possible to depend so much on someone.

522
00:52:06,223 --> 00:52:08,623
If that's the problem...

523
00:52:08,725 --> 00:52:11,193
soon you'll be free again.

524
00:52:13,063 --> 00:52:16,430
I'll go back home with him.

525
00:52:16,533 --> 00:52:19,900
In time, you'll forget me.

526
00:52:20,003 --> 00:52:21,800
Giovanna !

527
00:52:21,905 --> 00:52:24,305
- You must come with me.
- You know that's impossible.

528
00:52:26,943 --> 00:52:31,073
Then I'll come back to the store.
Is that what you want ?

529
00:53:01,978 --> 00:53:04,879
- Have you seen Gino ?
- No, I haven't see him.

530
00:53:09,219 --> 00:53:11,346
Have you seen Gino ?

531
00:53:11,454 --> 00:53:14,446
He's probably with some woman.

532
00:54:08,845 --> 00:54:12,212
Bravo! Bravo!

533
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:21,815
It went well, didn't it ?

534
00:54:25,996 --> 00:54:30,262
Be careful. You'll get sick. You're all sweaty.

535
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:37,601
We have to celebrate your success.
We too are from Ferrara.

536
00:54:37,707 --> 00:54:39,971
Yes, but I have company, my wife and a friend.

537
00:54:40,076 --> 00:54:43,671
Have a drink with us too.
The champagne is very good.

538
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:46,044
Okay, let's go, let's go.

539
00:55:33,129 --> 00:55:34,858
Cheers !

540
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:25,503
When there's free food and drinks, Gino's always first.

541
00:56:25,648 --> 00:56:30,813
Remember when he first came and didn't want to pay ?

542
00:56:33,123 --> 00:56:38,390
And those guys, they invited us.

543
00:56:38,495 --> 00:56:41,862
And who paid ?
Bregana !

544
00:56:41,965 --> 00:56:46,095
Someday they'll come to the store and I'll get my money back.

545
00:56:46,202 --> 00:56:52,903
What's important is working, and someone to leave the money to.

546
00:56:53,009 --> 00:56:55,307
Am I right ?

547
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:58,939
Well, Giovanna, when are we going to have a baby ?

548
00:56:59,048 --> 00:57:01,915
It's something to think about it. And you really have to commit.

549
00:57:02,018 --> 00:57:06,717
Tell her, Gino. But women want to keep their figure.

550
00:57:06,823 --> 00:57:10,418
It would be too bad to lose a voice like mine.  Let's go.

551
00:57:30,747 --> 00:57:35,411
You know what I'm thinking now ?

552
00:57:35,518 --> 00:57:37,713
Try to guess.

553
00:57:37,821 --> 00:57:41,450
Beniamino.

554
00:57:41,558 --> 00:57:43,526
That's what we'll call him.

555
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:47,494
Like the great tenor, Gigli. Then he'll be famous like him.

556
00:57:47,597 --> 00:57:50,088
That's a good one, isn't it ?

557
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,464
Come on !

558
00:57:52,569 --> 00:57:54,935
- Hurry up !
- I'm coming.

559
00:58:05,181 --> 00:58:08,344
Hurry up. We have a long way to go.

560
00:58:31,875 --> 00:58:34,708
Right away. Understand ?

561
00:58:36,546 --> 00:58:39,276
Right away.

562
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:57,026
Be careful. What are you doing ?

563
00:58:57,133 --> 00:59:00,034
Don't worry. I have a good grip.

564
00:59:03,139 --> 00:59:06,666
- Let him drive.
- Him ?

565
00:59:06,776 --> 00:59:09,176
Why ?

566
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:15,545
Oh, boy, I'm sick. Really sick.

567
00:59:15,652 --> 00:59:18,951
Get out, get some air. It'll do you good.

568
00:59:43,212 --> 00:59:46,204
Get behind the wheel-- now!

569
00:59:46,316 --> 00:59:48,910
Are we close to the river7

570
00:59:49,018 --> 00:59:52,545
It's probably 600 yards away.

571
01:00:05,034 --> 01:00:08,333
Well, now I feel better.

572
01:00:11,007 --> 01:00:12,634
What are you doing, getting out ?

573
01:00:12,742 --> 01:00:16,178
He's going to drive. You get some rest.

574
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:18,873
Let's go.

575
01:01:22,979 --> 01:01:27,814
Signor Bregana had too much to drink. At some point he got sick.

576
01:01:27,917 --> 01:01:31,216
You should have been driving. You're the mechanic, aren't you ?

577
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:34,380
Yes, but he was saying I didn't know the way.

578
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:36,321
You had been drinking too ?

579
01:01:36,426 --> 01:01:41,227
We were all together, but he had been drinking the most.

580
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:44,629
All right, go on.

581
01:01:44,734 --> 01:01:48,033
After stopping because he was feeling sick,

582
01:01:48,137 --> 01:01:51,800
he got back behind the wheel and drove three-quarters of a mile.

583
01:01:51,908 --> 01:01:55,469
Why did you leave the main road to get on the country road ?

584
01:01:57,213 --> 01:02:01,547
He wanted to get home faster. He took a shortcut.

585
01:02:01,651 --> 01:02:05,746
Maybe he didn't know the way well and missed the curve.

586
01:02:05,855 --> 01:02:09,484
He lost control of the car.

587
01:02:09,592 --> 01:02:13,289
I don't know what happened next.

588
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:15,330
It happened in an instant.

589
01:02:15,431 --> 01:02:18,730
When I opened my eyes I saw a lot of blood.

590
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:29,234
How do you suppose it was that your boss died instantly ?

591
01:02:29,345 --> 01:02:33,304
Perhaps he was pinned down between the steering wheel and the car.

592
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:35,941
The impact crushed his head.

593
01:02:36,052 --> 01:02:38,577
And why do you think Signora Bregana was unhurt ?

594
01:02:38,688 --> 01:02:41,987
I told you already, I had no time to look.

595
01:02:42,091 --> 01:02:47,688
She was by the door. Maybe she managed to jump out.

596
01:02:47,797 --> 01:02:50,265
She jumped with her purse and her hat ?

597
01:02:50,366 --> 01:02:55,770
With her purse and hat ?
What do you mean ?

598
01:02:55,872 --> 01:02:59,433
The first truck driver who saw Signora Bregana calling for help

599
01:02:59,542 --> 01:03:02,033
says she was holding onto her purse

600
01:03:02,145 --> 01:03:04,636
without showing any trace of being in an accident.

601
01:03:11,053 --> 01:03:14,853
I found them on the ground.
I took them to clean off the blood.

602
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:17,448
You jumped from the car before it rolled over ?

603
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:22,190
Yes. I saw it coming. I opened the door and jumped.

604
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:27,133
I asked my husband to let him drive, but he didn't want him to.

605
01:03:27,236 --> 01:03:29,067
And he was going faster than usual.

606
01:03:29,172 --> 01:03:31,663
What did you do after that ?

607
01:03:31,774 --> 01:03:35,266
I came back to the truck. I opened the door...

608
01:03:35,378 --> 01:03:38,211
and my husband wasn't answering.

609
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:41,283
Then he got out.

610
01:03:41,384 --> 01:03:44,148
Didn't he faint ?

611
01:03:44,253 --> 01:03:48,417
Yes. That's why I flagged the truck.

612
01:03:48,524 --> 01:03:52,585
When the drivers arrived, he was already moving on his own.

613
01:03:55,598 --> 01:03:58,362
Had you been with Signor Bregana for a long time ?

614
01:03:58,467 --> 01:04:01,334
The first time, I was there a few days.

615
01:04:01,437 --> 01:04:05,567
But I didn't like being tied down in one place and left.

616
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:09,338
Then, we met in Ancona and he insisted I come back.

617
01:04:09,445 --> 01:04:12,972
So you were traveling around and decided to settle down ?

618
01:04:13,082 --> 01:04:14,845
Yes, just like that.

619
01:04:14,951 --> 01:04:17,852
- Do you have anything else to say ?
- No.

620
01:04:17,954 --> 01:04:20,787
Let's go sign the report.

621
01:04:25,895 --> 01:04:29,695
"Death by accident", Superintendent ?

622
01:04:33,603 --> 01:04:37,061
"By accident".
Let's write it that way.

623
01:04:37,173 --> 01:04:39,937
Let's go back into town now.

624
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:03,392
In here is everything he had on him.

625
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:11,328
These are the papers to release the body from the morgue.

626
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:33,516
Thank you, Superintendent.

627
01:06:33,622 --> 01:06:35,988
Goodbye, Signora.

628
01:06:44,767 --> 01:06:47,702
We'll need to get a few more details...

629
01:06:47,803 --> 01:06:51,500
before closing the investigation.
We'll let you know.

630
01:08:09,718 --> 01:08:12,585
It's hot. Do you want a drink ?

631
01:08:32,842 --> 01:08:37,142
What is it ? Aren't you happy to be back ?

632
01:08:37,246 --> 01:08:40,409
I had envisioned it differently, coming back here.

633
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:53,625
We have to get used to it.

634
01:08:53,729 --> 01:08:56,630
When the store opens again

635
01:08:56,732 --> 01:09:01,635
and there are people around, it'll be easier.

636
01:09:03,172 --> 01:09:06,335
- We're reopening the store ?
- Of course.

637
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:17,949
What are you thinking ?

638
01:09:22,291 --> 01:09:24,452
Nothing.

639
01:09:34,703 --> 01:09:37,194
I'm happy.

640
01:09:38,607 --> 01:09:43,544
I still can't believe I'm here...

641
01:09:43,646 --> 01:09:46,046
alone with you.

642
01:09:48,117 --> 01:09:52,178
Gino--
isn't this what we wanted ?

643
01:09:53,956 --> 01:09:57,653
Yes. This is what we wanted.

644
01:10:00,696 --> 01:10:05,190
When I think back to the days I spent behind this counter--

645
01:10:05,301 --> 01:10:09,135
crying... alone.

646
01:10:09,238 --> 01:10:11,797
I wouldn't want to go back.

647
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:16,401
Who's talking about going back ?

648
01:10:21,083 --> 01:10:23,142
What's done is done.

649
01:10:37,833 --> 01:10:40,563
We must love each other very much.

650
01:10:40,669 --> 01:10:45,504
Otherwise, it was all for nothing.

651
01:10:45,608 --> 01:10:48,167
Listen, Giovanna, we have to go away.

652
01:10:48,277 --> 01:10:49,869
Why ?

653
01:10:49,979 --> 01:10:53,039
Because as long as we stay here, I'll always see him.

654
01:11:01,624 --> 01:11:04,115
I'll never forget him.

655
01:11:05,661 --> 01:11:08,960
I still see him behind that counter.
I still hear his voice.

656
01:11:09,064 --> 01:11:10,861
Look, Giovanna,

657
01:11:10,966 --> 01:11:12,558
let's sell the store and move away--

658
01:11:12,668 --> 01:11:15,831
away from here.

659
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:19,374
If you saw how silly you looked,

660
01:11:19,475 --> 01:11:22,273
talking so loudly here in the store.

661
01:11:27,583 --> 01:11:30,552
Somebody will hear you.

662
01:11:53,776 --> 01:11:56,142
Don't drink so much.

663
01:11:57,613 --> 01:12:00,639
- Someone's out there.
- Let them go.

664
01:12:00,749 --> 01:12:02,080
We can't. They saw us come in.

665
01:12:02,184 --> 01:12:04,118
- Then you go.
- I can't, dressed like this.

666
01:12:06,588 --> 01:12:09,557
I'll go upstairs.

667
01:12:12,027 --> 01:12:16,020
You know what to do. The drinks are all there.

668
01:12:17,633 --> 01:12:19,726
Open up !

669
01:12:51,433 --> 01:12:54,425
- Are you closed ?
- No. What do you want ?

670
01:12:54,536 --> 01:12:58,529
I knocked, but didn't see anybody.
I'd like something to drink.

671
01:13:19,762 --> 01:13:21,787
It's hard to work with only one arm.

672
01:13:31,273 --> 01:13:34,071
- Are you the owner ?
- The owner is inside.

673
01:13:34,176 --> 01:13:38,169
I'm sorry. Sometimes I feel like chatting.

674
01:13:39,815 --> 01:13:43,808
I'm new around here and I don't know anybody.

675
01:13:43,919 --> 01:13:46,478
I'm looking for work.

676
01:13:49,691 --> 01:13:52,421
- How much is it ?
- One lira.

677
01:13:52,528 --> 01:13:55,292
That's cheap. In town, they want 50.

678
01:13:55,397 --> 01:13:57,729
Pay me whatever you want.

679
01:14:01,670 --> 01:14:04,662
You must be knew at this.

680
01:14:04,773 --> 01:14:08,607
You're lucky I'm honest.

681
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:34,228
Who was it ?

682
01:14:34,336 --> 01:14:37,635
Someone looking for work.
He was asking questions.

683
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:45,671
I don't like people that pry into other people's business.

684
01:14:47,216 --> 01:14:49,741
I don't like people asking questions.

685
01:14:53,856 --> 01:14:57,758
What are you afraid of ?

686
01:14:57,860 --> 01:15:00,090
You're worrying about nothing.

687
01:15:02,764 --> 01:15:04,755
- What were you doing there ?
- Nothing.

688
01:15:04,867 --> 01:15:07,893
- Let me see ?
- What do you care7

689
01:15:08,003 --> 01:15:09,368
- I want to see.
- No.

690
01:15:10,472 --> 01:15:12,599
- Give it to me, Giovanna.
- No, Gino !

691
01:15:15,611 --> 01:15:17,636
Let go of me.

692
01:15:32,895 --> 01:15:37,229
Good shot. And on the fly.

693
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:41,166
Bregana wouldn't have spent so much money in one evening.

694
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:44,262
Of course, he wants to be comfortable.

695
01:15:44,373 --> 01:15:46,671
Say what you want, they aren't happy.

696
01:15:46,775 --> 01:15:48,868
Not at all.

697
01:15:48,977 --> 01:15:51,878
There she is, the lady boss, with Father Remigio.

698
01:16:10,732 --> 01:16:13,098
Father Remigio is here.

699
01:16:13,201 --> 01:16:16,193
I stopped to talk with him after mass to ask his opinion,

700
01:16:16,305 --> 01:16:18,830
then I asked him to come by.

701
01:16:18,941 --> 01:16:22,308
it was a long time since he last came by to play bocce.

702
01:16:22,411 --> 01:16:27,678
It wasn't up to me.
I had to give up the game.

703
01:16:29,217 --> 01:16:31,651
Good morning, Costa.

704
01:16:33,488 --> 01:16:35,479
Have you been drinking again ?

705
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:39,083
I have nothing else to do to pass the time.

706
01:16:39,194 --> 01:16:41,992
Today it's because you have nothing to do.

707
01:16:42,097 --> 01:16:44,725
Tomorrow it'll be because someone invited you.

708
01:16:44,833 --> 01:16:47,700
You always have an excuse to get drunk like this.

709
01:16:47,803 --> 01:16:49,293
Because there is never anything happening.

710
01:16:49,404 --> 01:16:54,899
Calm down, my dear Costa. You know drinking is bad for you.

711
01:16:55,010 --> 01:16:57,444
After what happened to poor Bregana...

712
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:03,282
It was such a terrible tragedy.
We can't get over it.

713
01:17:03,385 --> 01:17:05,410
Let's not talk about it anymore.

714
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:09,047
Peace to his soul.

715
01:17:09,157 --> 01:17:10,886
Would you like a Strega, Father ?

716
01:17:10,993 --> 01:17:14,019
No, you don't have to.

717
01:17:14,129 --> 01:17:17,860
But if it helps to break the ice with this good young man...

718
01:17:22,270 --> 01:17:26,331
You see, you should put an end to this arrangement of yours.

719
01:17:26,441 --> 01:17:30,707
That's exactly why I came to see you today.

720
01:17:32,681 --> 01:17:34,706
Cheers.

721
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:43,721
If we-- how would you say-- resolved this situation right away ?

722
01:17:43,825 --> 01:17:49,320
No, no. Not right away. It would not quiet down the rumors.

723
01:17:49,431 --> 01:17:52,958
We aren't doing anything wrong.

724
01:17:53,068 --> 01:17:56,629
Thank you. People always say that.

725
01:17:56,738 --> 01:18:00,037
But you're hurting yourselves.

726
01:18:00,142 --> 01:18:04,806
My feeling is that he... could find himself another place.

727
01:18:04,913 --> 01:18:08,508
Maybe around here.

728
01:18:08,617 --> 01:18:11,711
I also said from the beginning that it would have been better to go away.

729
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:13,378
I'm not afraid of rumors.

730
01:18:13,488 --> 01:18:16,252
It's not the rumors, Signora Bregana.

731
01:18:16,358 --> 01:18:20,488
We mustn't forget God and our duties.

732
01:18:20,595 --> 01:18:26,329
Listen to me. Work alone. Maybe only for a while.

733
01:18:26,435 --> 01:18:29,029
Perhaps we shouldn't continue talking about this now.

734
01:18:29,137 --> 01:18:33,301
I'll stop by the church with him in a few days.

735
01:18:33,408 --> 01:18:37,242
As you wish. But don't forget what I've told you.

736
01:18:37,345 --> 01:18:39,745
We have to bring this to an end.

737
01:18:39,848 --> 01:18:42,646
- Good morning.
- Here come the musicians.

738
01:18:42,751 --> 01:18:45,413
- It is the group from Polesella.
- Good, very good.

739
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:48,114
Take care, then.

740
01:18:48,223 --> 01:18:51,192
Since they are here, I'll go play some bocce.

741
01:18:51,293 --> 01:18:54,057
- Good day, Father.
- Good day.

742
01:18:54,162 --> 01:18:55,026
Good day.

743
01:18:55,130 --> 01:18:58,395
- Would you like a glass of wine ?
- Yes, please.

744
01:19:15,450 --> 01:19:17,611
Who said anything about marriage ?

745
01:19:19,254 --> 01:19:21,950
Do you think l want to spend my entire life here ?

746
01:19:23,225 --> 01:19:25,921
You heard. Even the priest says we have to go away.

747
01:19:26,027 --> 01:19:28,757
Don't talk like this in front of others.

748
01:19:57,392 --> 01:20:00,759
Do you hear what I'm saying ?
I feel like screaming--

749
01:20:00,862 --> 01:20:03,956
telling everybody what's happening, to put an end to it all.

750
01:20:04,065 --> 01:20:06,932
You seem afraid to marry me.

751
01:20:07,035 --> 01:20:10,129
Maybe you don't love me anymore.

752
01:20:10,238 --> 01:20:15,369
It was only last month
when we met in Ancona,

753
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:18,640
and you were saying you couldn't live without me.

754
01:20:18,747 --> 01:20:21,807
That's true...

755
01:20:21,917 --> 01:20:24,010
but each day I hate this house more.

756
01:20:24,119 --> 01:20:27,384
We cannot leave now. We'd become destitute.

757
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:31,823
Nobody would ever forgive us. We have to stay.

758
01:20:31,927 --> 01:20:34,418
We have to. Do you understand ?

759
01:20:38,567 --> 01:20:41,934
I know-- you've always feared uncertainty.

760
01:20:43,238 --> 01:20:45,706
But you see...

761
01:20:45,807 --> 01:20:48,275
I was thinking we could sell this place,

762
01:20:48,376 --> 01:20:53,336
take the money and go anywhere we want.

763
01:20:53,448 --> 01:20:56,383
Then we could truly start all over.

764
01:20:56,484 --> 01:21:01,353
Let's wait a while. Not now, I told you.

765
01:21:01,456 --> 01:21:06,120
How could we leave everything like this, all of a sudden ?

766
01:21:06,228 --> 01:21:08,059
But I can't handle it.

767
01:21:08,163 --> 01:21:12,532
I can't get used to it-- sleeping in his bed, eating at his table.

768
01:21:12,634 --> 01:21:15,467
That's silly.

769
01:21:15,570 --> 01:21:19,836
We must face people... without fear.

770
01:21:19,941 --> 01:21:22,967
So that's why you want people here,

771
01:21:23,078 --> 01:21:26,309
and the music, to get attention.

772
01:21:26,414 --> 01:21:30,680
What are you thinking ?
We have to run the business.

773
01:21:30,785 --> 01:21:34,448
Take care of it then, if you like parties.

774
01:21:34,556 --> 01:21:39,118
You've learned how to do so many other jobs, you can learn this one, too.

775
01:21:39,227 --> 01:21:41,092
This is not a job...

776
01:21:41,196 --> 01:21:45,360
keeping guard on a dead man's house.

777
01:21:45,467 --> 01:21:49,267
- Signora Giovanna ?
- I'm coming.

778
01:22:13,595 --> 01:22:15,825
Signora Giovanna ?

779
01:22:16,998 --> 01:22:19,694
- Signora Giovanna.
- I'm coming.

780
01:22:27,075 --> 01:22:29,737
Good day.

781
01:22:29,844 --> 01:22:32,210
What can I get you ?

782
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,338
How did you find me here ?

783
01:24:41,443 --> 01:24:45,243
What a question. Everybody's talking about you.

784
01:24:46,448 --> 01:24:48,939
No. Let's go this way.

785
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:56,413
What do you do with all your smart ideas ?

786
01:24:56,524 --> 01:24:59,618
l carry them with me. Why ?

787
01:24:59,727 --> 01:25:02,252
You had your chance.

788
01:25:02,363 --> 01:25:06,356
What do you need with them ? You've played your hand.

789
01:25:06,468 --> 01:25:11,030
You're doing pretty well here.

790
01:25:11,139 --> 01:25:13,869
You've lost the taste for travel, haven't you ?

791
01:25:13,975 --> 01:25:16,136
You can't wander around all your life.

792
01:25:16,244 --> 01:25:19,907
You'll see, sooner or later it'll be the same for you.

793
01:25:32,627 --> 01:25:35,721
No.

794
01:25:35,830 --> 01:25:38,822
You should know better. People like me will never stop.

795
01:25:38,933 --> 01:25:42,266
- Why do you say that ?
- You've acted badly, Gino.

796
01:25:42,370 --> 01:25:44,429
What's wrong with loving a woman ?

797
01:25:44,539 --> 01:25:47,565
- it's not about the woman.
- Then l don't know what you mean.

798
01:26:02,891 --> 01:26:07,055
You know, Gino, I'm leaving now.

799
01:26:07,162 --> 01:26:10,188
It's a good time of year.

800
01:26:10,298 --> 01:26:13,699
I came by thinking maybe you would come with me.

801
01:26:13,801 --> 01:26:17,669
If it were like before, you would have said yes.

802
01:26:19,874 --> 01:26:21,842
I wanted to go to Sicily.

803
01:26:21,943 --> 01:26:26,403
Sicily is beautiful, you know.

804
01:26:26,514 --> 01:26:30,211
Then again, lots of places are nice-- Naples, Genoa.

805
01:26:30,318 --> 01:26:33,082
Have you ever been to Genoa ?

806
01:26:33,188 --> 01:26:38,251
In Genoa you can walk for hours by the docks.

807
01:26:38,359 --> 01:26:42,352
It's like a main street. You meet a lot of friends,

808
01:26:42,463 --> 01:26:45,899
because everybody goes to Genoa.

809
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:50,835
I know they're building a road. It's easy to find work.

810
01:26:50,939 --> 01:26:54,705
You'll spend the day blasting your way through the mountains.

811
01:27:07,722 --> 01:27:10,623
I can't stand it any longer.

812
01:27:17,298 --> 01:27:19,857
I don't like hanging around anymore.

813
01:27:19,968 --> 01:27:21,560
What's become of you ?

814
01:27:21,669 --> 01:27:24,297
I don't like it anymore !

815
01:27:28,276 --> 01:27:30,870
I don't like to travel anymore.

816
01:27:30,979 --> 01:27:32,844
And stop playing like you know everything.

817
01:27:32,947 --> 01:27:36,178
All this talk-- because I don't want to be a bum anymore.

818
01:27:36,284 --> 01:27:40,482
A bum ? You say that in so harshly.

819
01:27:40,588 --> 01:27:43,819
I was wrong. I thought I could talk to you like one of us.

820
01:27:43,925 --> 01:27:47,417
But you don't want to understand. Certain things you pay for.

821
01:27:47,528 --> 01:27:50,395
- Shut up.
- Yes, I'll shut up.

822
01:27:50,498 --> 01:27:52,762
Don't worry, I'm not going to tell on you.

823
01:27:52,867 --> 01:27:55,199
- Don't worry.
- Shut up !

824
01:27:55,303 --> 01:27:58,295
Stay here if you want, with that woman you got by--

825
01:27:58,406 --> 01:28:00,169
Shut up !

826
01:28:05,146 --> 01:28:09,515
Before, you only threatened me. Now you've got more courage.

827
01:28:09,617 --> 01:28:11,585
Can I help you ?

828
01:28:18,159 --> 01:28:22,892
- But you hurt yourself.
- Thank you. I'll take care of myself.

829
01:28:22,997 --> 01:28:26,057
Your temper is too hot, my boy. Punching him right away, even if--

830
01:28:26,167 --> 01:28:28,260
It's our business.

831
01:28:33,074 --> 01:28:35,474
I'll walk with you for awhile.

832
01:28:35,576 --> 01:28:39,273
No, I'll go alone. I don't need anybody.

833
01:28:39,380 --> 01:28:41,541
Go away, boys. Go on.

834
01:29:01,502 --> 01:29:04,403
Spagnolo ?
Spagnolo... ?

835
01:29:10,945 --> 01:29:12,139
Spagnolo !

836
01:29:21,823 --> 01:29:26,988
I'm warning you for your own good.

837
01:29:27,095 --> 01:29:32,829
He has a hot temper. He punches hard.

838
01:29:32,934 --> 01:29:35,368
He could be dangerous.

839
01:29:38,506 --> 01:29:40,736
Signora Giovanna ?
Signora Giovanna ?

840
01:29:40,842 --> 01:29:42,776
I'm coming.

841
01:29:55,022 --> 01:29:56,580
Hello ?

842
01:30:09,804 --> 01:30:12,204
How do you do ?

843
01:30:16,577 --> 01:30:19,102
Signor Giuseppe, you are known as "Spagnolo" ?

844
01:30:19,213 --> 01:30:20,544
Yes, sir.

845
01:31:29,050 --> 01:31:31,484
Let's go home, it's late.

846
01:31:36,123 --> 01:31:41,117
We made l80 lire today.

847
01:31:41,229 --> 01:31:44,392
It was a good idea to hire the musicians.

848
01:31:44,499 --> 01:31:49,368
Why can't they leave us alone ? It seems everyone knows.

849
01:31:49,470 --> 01:31:52,405
What are you saying ?

850
01:31:57,879 --> 01:32:04,307
This time, one year ago... I was in the Apuane Mountains.

851
01:32:05,419 --> 01:32:07,751
I was working in the mines.

852
01:32:19,700 --> 01:32:22,396
You talk as if I wasn't here.

853
01:32:52,733 --> 01:32:55,600
Aren't you going to eat ?

854
01:32:55,703 --> 01:32:58,103
I'm not hungry.

855
01:35:23,350 --> 01:35:26,114
What are you doing ? Give me my ball of wool.

856
01:35:32,727 --> 01:35:34,661
Thanks.

857
01:35:34,762 --> 01:35:36,855
Are the boys misbehaving ? Are they bothering you ?

858
01:35:36,964 --> 01:35:39,558
No. They just do it for fun.

859
01:35:49,810 --> 01:35:53,371
Ice cream.

860
01:35:57,218 --> 01:35:59,743
Ice cream.

861
01:36:02,923 --> 01:36:05,187
Ice cream for you, sir ?

862
01:36:13,701 --> 01:36:17,296
- Here you go.
- Would you like one, too ?

863
01:36:17,404 --> 01:36:19,133
Another one.

864
01:36:25,746 --> 01:36:27,714
Thank you.

865
01:36:31,452 --> 01:36:33,352
Ice cream.

866
01:36:33,454 --> 01:36:35,183
- It's what you need with this heat.
- Why are you smiling ?

867
01:36:35,289 --> 01:36:37,757
No reason, I just feel happy.

868
01:36:37,858 --> 01:36:41,259
That means you don't have any worries.

869
01:36:41,362 --> 01:36:46,163
I have worries, all right. Maybe it was meeting you.

870
01:36:46,267 --> 01:36:48,826
Or maybe it was the ice cream.

871
01:36:48,936 --> 01:36:51,200
You are a big flirt, aren't you ?

872
01:36:51,305 --> 01:36:54,240
It depends, if I like someone.

873
01:36:54,341 --> 01:36:56,241
Then you like me ?

874
01:36:56,343 --> 01:36:58,834
Why are you asking ? Do you have something in mind ?

875
01:36:58,946 --> 01:37:01,505
Maybe.

876
01:37:02,616 --> 01:37:06,143
- Are you from around here ?
- No, I'm leaving soon.

877
01:37:06,253 --> 01:37:09,313
- You're not from Ferrara ?
- No.

878
01:37:09,423 --> 01:37:11,914
Then you'll be going back home.

879
01:37:12,026 --> 01:37:13,891
I can't go back home.

880
01:37:17,565 --> 01:37:19,465
Where are you going, then ?

881
01:37:19,567 --> 01:37:22,434
I'm on tour. I'm a dancer. Next we'll go to Como.

882
01:37:22,536 --> 01:37:27,997
I'm in the company. I'm in the second row, left side.

883
01:37:28,108 --> 01:37:30,338
You can come see me, if you want. At Cinema Teatro Verdi.

884
01:37:31,445 --> 01:37:34,278
You're a great girl.

885
01:37:34,381 --> 01:37:36,906
I'm glad I met you.

886
01:37:37,017 --> 01:37:40,282
Keep me company. I'm due back at the theater for rehearsal.

887
01:37:40,387 --> 01:37:42,617
I can't. I'm waiting for someone.

888
01:37:44,992 --> 01:37:47,324
Thanks for the ice cream. It was very kind of you.

889
01:37:47,428 --> 01:37:49,828
There aren't enough people who are very kind.

890
01:38:25,733 --> 01:38:27,598
Do you like her ?

891
01:38:27,701 --> 01:38:30,397
The dancers all stay at Number 15 in Via Saraceno.

892
01:38:30,504 --> 01:38:32,563
There are even better-looking ones.

893
01:38:32,673 --> 01:38:34,937
Gino ? Gino.

894
01:38:39,647 --> 01:38:42,343
Do you want to know something ?

895
01:38:42,449 --> 01:38:44,940
Bregana had a life insurance policy.

896
01:38:51,091 --> 01:38:54,754
They'll pay me, but they asked a lot of questions.

897
01:38:54,862 --> 01:38:58,889
At times it was worse than being with the police.

898
01:38:58,999 --> 01:39:01,024
But everything went all right.

899
01:39:01,135 --> 01:39:04,571
I'll get 50,000 lire. We can expand the store.

900
01:39:04,672 --> 01:39:08,574
A life insurance policy ?

901
01:39:08,676 --> 01:39:13,170
And you got paid money for it ?

902
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:17,649
Yes, that's the way these things work.

903
01:39:24,825 --> 01:39:27,384
What good fortune for you!

904
01:39:27,494 --> 01:39:30,019
But Gino, the money is yours too.

905
01:39:30,130 --> 01:39:32,860
What are you thinking ?

906
01:39:37,404 --> 01:39:39,702
I don't want any of it !

907
01:39:39,807 --> 01:39:42,332
Why are you telling me this now ?

908
01:39:42,443 --> 01:39:44,707
How could I have told you before ?

909
01:39:44,812 --> 01:39:46,837
Before I got the letter.

910
01:39:46,947 --> 01:39:49,142
Stop playing with me.

911
01:39:49,249 --> 01:39:53,310
How stupid I was. I didn't understand.

912
01:39:57,358 --> 01:40:03,558
When we met you wanted to get rid of me.

913
01:40:08,335 --> 01:40:11,566
Now I know why you didn't want to come away with me.

914
01:40:11,672 --> 01:40:13,299
It was this money--

915
01:40:13,407 --> 01:40:16,342
No, Gino. You're not thinking straight.

916
01:40:16,443 --> 01:40:18,411
I'm not ?

917
01:40:18,512 --> 01:40:23,142
Now l know that you used me.
You needed someone to help you.

918
01:40:23,250 --> 01:40:27,653
If it had been only for the money, I could have found someone else--

919
01:40:27,755 --> 01:40:30,451
- With more courage than you !
- You don't need any courage.

920
01:40:33,060 --> 01:40:34,891
- I wouldn't do it again.
- Gino!

921
01:40:34,995 --> 01:40:37,520
I'm sick of you.

922
01:40:37,631 --> 01:40:39,792
I can't bear to look at you anymore.

923
01:40:39,900 --> 01:40:41,891
Watch what you say.

924
01:40:42,002 --> 01:40:43,401
Are you going to blackmail me now ?

925
01:40:43,504 --> 01:40:45,199
I'll show you I'm capable of leaving you.

926
01:40:45,305 --> 01:40:49,241
- Gino!
- I don't want to see you.

927
01:41:49,870 --> 01:41:51,337
Is there a girl living here ?

928
01:41:51,438 --> 01:41:53,997
- Her name is Anita.
- Yes. She is out now.

929
01:41:54,108 --> 01:41:56,372
If you want to wait, that's her room.

930
01:41:56,477 --> 01:41:58,001
Thank you.

931
01:43:33,407 --> 01:43:35,238
Now you behave yourself !

932
01:43:35,342 --> 01:43:37,367
First you say yes, then no. What do I do now ?

933
01:43:37,477 --> 01:43:40,036
Go back to Rosina!

934
01:43:42,282 --> 01:43:44,944
I wasn't expecting you to visit me.

935
01:43:48,555 --> 01:43:53,754
I was in the neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by.

936
01:44:01,235 --> 01:44:03,203
Then that means that you like me.

937
01:44:15,082 --> 01:44:18,017
I'm glad you came by.

938
01:44:31,365 --> 01:44:34,630
You're different from other men.

939
01:44:34,735 --> 01:44:38,796
I don't know why I feel this way.

940
01:45:03,063 --> 01:45:07,124
Why did you come here ?

941
01:45:29,389 --> 01:45:32,119
Now I'm going to eat.

942
01:45:35,962 --> 01:45:38,556
Do you want some ?
Are you hungry ?

943
01:46:06,860 --> 01:46:11,320
Listen, let's eat together. I'll go out and get something.

944
01:46:11,431 --> 01:46:14,730
Wait. I'm coming with you.

945
01:47:24,204 --> 01:47:26,968
Where are you going ?

946
01:47:27,073 --> 01:47:30,338
Now I understand why you were so worried about the insurance money.

947
01:47:30,444 --> 01:47:31,843
Come.

948
01:47:31,945 --> 01:47:33,742
Do you think I'm going to leave you with her ?

949
01:47:33,847 --> 01:47:36,611
- After all I did for you ?
- For me ?

950
01:47:36,716 --> 01:47:41,210
We love each other. That's why we did what we did.

951
01:47:41,321 --> 01:47:44,415
Enough. She knows nothing about me.

952
01:47:44,524 --> 01:47:47,652
Are you concerned about her ?

953
01:47:47,761 --> 01:47:49,695
Gino !

954
01:47:52,299 --> 01:47:55,894
Quiet ! Don't say anything.

955
01:48:05,378 --> 01:48:10,315
Listen, Gino, forget about what I said a minute ago.

956
01:48:10,417 --> 01:48:14,717
It wasn't fair. But I'm at the end of my rope.

957
01:48:14,821 --> 01:48:19,087
You wanted me, Gino, and now you don't care about me.

958
01:48:19,192 --> 01:48:22,025
Let's go back home. You'll calm down.

959
01:48:22,128 --> 01:48:26,565
You'll think straight again. You'll stop treating me like this.

960
01:48:26,666 --> 01:48:30,397
No. Leave me alone.

961
01:48:33,540 --> 01:48:35,701
Look out, Gino.

962
01:48:37,978 --> 01:48:41,141
- Look out ? Why ?
- You know.

963
01:48:42,415 --> 01:48:46,784
I only have to speak up and they'll be after you.

964
01:48:49,089 --> 01:48:51,683
Your choice. Come with me or...

965
01:48:51,791 --> 01:48:54,760
Or what ?

966
01:49:23,156 --> 01:49:26,182
I'm sorry about what happened on the street.

967
01:49:28,862 --> 01:49:32,263
I've already eaten, but you can make yourself at home.

968
01:49:42,375 --> 01:49:44,275
I'll tell you who she is.

969
01:49:44,377 --> 01:49:46,971
I don't need to know.

970
01:50:00,427 --> 01:50:05,126
- Why are you acting differently now ?
- It's not important.

971
01:50:44,804 --> 01:50:50,140
Do you realize that your delay could impede justice ?

972
01:50:50,243 --> 01:50:52,234
Superintendent, we have to work.

973
01:50:52,345 --> 01:50:55,246
One day we work here, another day we go elsewhere.

974
01:50:55,348 --> 01:50:59,614
Now you called us and we came. We told you all we knew.

975
01:50:59,719 --> 01:51:02,950
Could you swear you saw both the man and the woman

976
01:51:03,056 --> 01:51:06,958
climb up the levee as the car was rolling down ?

977
01:51:07,060 --> 01:51:09,722
Yes, it made an impression.

978
01:51:09,829 --> 01:51:14,061
I know the road very well and it seemed strange to me.

979
01:51:14,167 --> 01:51:17,261
We were the first to help, but we had to go.

980
01:51:17,370 --> 01:51:20,362
Other people came and we felt we couldn't do much more.

981
01:51:20,473 --> 01:51:22,737
Yes, they already told me they were in a hurry

982
01:51:22,842 --> 01:51:25,208
because they had to be in Milan before noon.

983
01:51:25,311 --> 01:51:28,974
All right. Sign here on the report.

984
01:51:29,082 --> 01:51:31,482
Come over here.

985
01:51:31,584 --> 01:51:33,677
What about that man, Costa ?

986
01:51:33,787 --> 01:51:37,223
Don't worry, Superintendent. We kept an eye on him.

987
01:51:37,323 --> 01:51:41,851
Today he's here in town, but he has a two-way ticket.

988
01:51:41,961 --> 01:51:44,953
Let's stop him before he goes.

989
01:51:45,065 --> 01:51:47,556
I want to question him.

990
01:51:47,667 --> 01:51:51,660
Sure, Superintendent. I'll take care of it.

991
01:51:55,542 --> 01:52:00,844
I keep hearing it.

992
01:52:00,947 --> 01:52:04,644
He tried to get up--

993
01:52:08,021 --> 01:52:10,888
then I saw him...

994
01:52:10,990 --> 01:52:14,050
fall again.

995
01:52:14,160 --> 01:52:16,890
She was looking at me...

996
01:52:16,996 --> 01:52:19,487
looking at me.

997
01:52:19,599 --> 01:52:22,124
Then I acted...

998
01:52:22,235 --> 01:52:24,465
without realizing what I was doing.

999
01:52:29,142 --> 01:52:33,237
She had been so unhappy.

1000
01:52:33,346 --> 01:52:35,041
Tell me...

1001
01:52:35,148 --> 01:52:38,606
- Do you despise me now ?
- No.

1002
01:52:38,718 --> 01:52:42,381
To me you are still the same person.

1003
01:52:42,489 --> 01:52:46,425
I'll never be able to be what I was before.

1004
01:52:46,526 --> 01:52:51,395
Now I'm bound to her forever.

1005
01:52:54,901 --> 01:52:57,495
I'm a police officer.

1006
01:53:01,574 --> 01:53:03,701
Coffee.

1007
01:53:33,273 --> 01:53:35,764
Now I understand-- that man. . .

1008
01:53:35,875 --> 01:53:38,673
has been following me for a month.

1009
01:53:38,778 --> 01:53:42,441
He's a policeman. She's reported me.

1010
01:53:43,550 --> 01:53:49,716
I must get out of here no matter what, Anita.

1011
01:53:49,823 --> 01:53:52,485
What can you do ? Think for a moment.

1012
01:53:52,592 --> 01:53:55,390
If you go back to her you'll never be safe again.

1013
01:53:55,495 --> 01:53:59,898
You can help me. Go downstairs.

1014
01:53:59,999 --> 01:54:04,493
There's a man out there. Come, I'll show you.

1015
01:54:14,447 --> 01:54:16,347
Did you see him ?

1016
01:54:16,449 --> 01:54:18,610
Would you be able to recognize him ?

1017
01:54:18,718 --> 01:54:21,243
Yes.

1018
01:54:21,354 --> 01:54:24,653
You must distract him until I get out of here.

1019
01:54:24,757 --> 01:54:26,782
Tell him...

1020
01:54:26,893 --> 01:54:29,794
you saw him looking up here.

1021
01:54:29,896 --> 01:54:33,388
You know who he is looking for.
Tell him I left an hour ago.

1022
01:54:33,499 --> 01:54:38,334
Yes, tell him that. "He was here but left an hour ago".

1023
01:54:38,438 --> 01:54:41,339
What if he doesn't believe me ?

1024
01:54:41,441 --> 01:54:45,138
What else can we say ?

1025
01:54:49,182 --> 01:54:53,881
I'll tell him I'm angry with you...

1026
01:54:53,987 --> 01:54:56,922
because you didn't pay me.

1027
01:55:16,676 --> 01:55:18,644
I'll go now.

1028
01:59:50,683 --> 01:59:52,844
Giovanna, open the door.

1029
01:59:58,758 --> 02:00:00,726
Open up, Giovanna.

1030
02:00:04,497 --> 02:00:06,965
Open the door, Giovanna.

1031
02:00:08,968 --> 02:00:11,596
Open up !

1032
02:00:15,708 --> 02:00:18,370
Open ! Giovanna !

1033
02:00:20,580 --> 02:00:22,605
Open !

1034
02:00:26,485 --> 02:00:28,510
Here I am.

1035
02:00:28,621 --> 02:00:31,317
Now you can kill me if you like.

1036
02:00:35,761 --> 02:00:37,388
You kept your promise, didn't you ?

1037
02:00:37,496 --> 02:00:39,760
I don't care about anything anymore.

1038
02:00:39,865 --> 02:00:43,596
I know what you're capable of. I'm not afraid.

1039
02:00:43,703 --> 02:00:46,797
- You're not afraid, eh ?
- I don't care about anything.

1040
02:00:46,906 --> 02:00:50,205
You're not afraid ?
Then why did you report me ?

1041
02:00:50,309 --> 02:00:54,006
It was only a threat.

1042
02:00:54,113 --> 02:00:56,946
It was only to keep you here.

1043
02:00:57,049 --> 02:01:00,280
But now, if you want to go, go.

1044
02:01:00,386 --> 02:01:03,184
I'm not afraid to be alone anymore.

1045
02:01:03,289 --> 02:01:06,383
I always knew that for you I was the same as any other man.

1046
02:01:06,492 --> 02:01:09,518
No, Gino.

1047
02:01:09,629 --> 02:01:11,995
Don't you understand ?

1048
02:01:12,098 --> 02:01:13,895
Don't make up something else.

1049
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:17,163
You're glad you reported me. They'll catch me,

1050
02:01:17,270 --> 02:01:19,738
and you'll have your revenge, isn't that so ?

1051
02:01:19,839 --> 02:01:23,297
I didn't report you. I felt like doing it...

1052
02:01:23,409 --> 02:01:27,243
when I saw that girl come between us.

1053
02:01:27,346 --> 02:01:33,410
Only because of that-- but I controlled myself.

1054
02:01:33,519 --> 02:01:38,513
I should've known that sooner or later you'd go.

1055
02:01:38,624 --> 02:01:43,391
These last few days I was afraid you'd go.

1056
02:01:43,496 --> 02:01:46,829
You can't bear staying in one place too long !

1057
02:01:54,974 --> 02:01:58,410
I remember...

1058
02:01:58,511 --> 02:02:01,810
the first time you came here.

1059
02:02:03,516 --> 02:02:06,178
You didn't even have socks on your feet.

1060
02:02:10,956 --> 02:02:15,051
I understand why I loved you so much right away--

1061
02:02:15,161 --> 02:02:18,187
and why I hated him so much.

1062
02:02:19,965 --> 02:02:22,593
Now I couldn't hurt you even if I wanted to.

1063
02:02:22,702 --> 02:02:25,637
Not even to stop you from leaving if that's what you want.

1064
02:02:25,738 --> 02:02:28,639
Because...

1065
02:02:28,741 --> 02:02:32,700
now I'm having a baby. It's your baby, Gino.

1066
02:02:37,116 --> 02:02:39,084
What are you saying ?

1067
02:02:39,185 --> 02:02:43,315
Yes. I suspected.

1068
02:02:43,422 --> 02:02:46,084
Now I'm sure.

1069
02:02:46,192 --> 02:02:51,892
I wanted to tell you about this.

1070
02:02:51,997 --> 02:02:55,228
Before, everything was confused,

1071
02:02:55,334 --> 02:02:57,768
but now I see clearly.

1072
02:03:00,506 --> 02:03:03,634
I've thought about it a lot--

1073
02:03:03,743 --> 02:03:08,112
about us, the baby.

1074
02:03:11,584 --> 02:03:16,647
We have taken one life away,

1075
02:03:16,756 --> 02:03:19,691
we can create another one.

1076
02:03:19,792 --> 02:03:23,193
That's why I'm not afraid anymore.

1077
02:03:23,295 --> 02:03:25,854
I have no resentment toward you.

1078
02:03:25,965 --> 02:03:29,867
l know l love you, Gino,

1079
02:03:29,969 --> 02:03:33,132
and I can't hurt you.

1080
02:03:38,811 --> 02:03:44,477
But you, how can you stop from taking it out on me ?

1081
02:03:49,522 --> 02:03:52,650
Now, if you want, you can do it.

1082
02:03:52,758 --> 02:03:55,352
I've told you everything.

1083
02:03:55,461 --> 02:03:58,089
I'm here.

1084
02:04:15,514 --> 02:04:19,951
Do you think I'm a bad man ?

1085
02:04:20,052 --> 02:04:22,816
No.

1086
02:04:58,891 --> 02:05:00,620
Gino !

1087
02:05:00,693 --> 02:05:02,923
Gino !

1088
02:05:09,468 --> 02:05:11,333
I've looked for you all night.

1089
02:05:11,437 --> 02:05:13,837
You're all wet.

1090
02:05:42,701 --> 02:05:46,102
- Did you run ?
- Yes, but I don't mind.

1091
02:05:46,205 --> 02:05:49,038
Forgive me, Giovanna.

1092
02:05:49,141 --> 02:05:52,440
It would have been terrible if I'd hurt you.

1093
02:05:52,545 --> 02:05:57,608
This night was liberating for me.

1094
02:05:57,716 --> 02:06:00,617
It's like I've become a new man.

1095
02:06:02,855 --> 02:06:06,416
Before, something was keeping me away from you.

1096
02:06:06,525 --> 02:06:09,255
I had no peace.

1097
02:06:46,665 --> 02:06:49,964
Now I feel certain, Giovanna.

1098
02:06:52,771 --> 02:06:55,604
But we have to leave--

1099
02:06:55,708 --> 02:06:59,041
for good, right away.

1100
02:06:59,144 --> 02:07:01,806
We will go away.

1101
02:07:01,914 --> 02:07:05,042
It was impossible not to go wrong.

1102
02:07:05,150 --> 02:07:08,278
With everything we lived through, we should have left.

1103
02:07:08,387 --> 02:07:13,290
From now on, don't listen to me. You were right.

1104
02:07:14,960 --> 02:07:17,155
Don't say anything more.

1105
02:07:17,262 --> 02:07:20,060
Didn't I say everything has changed now ?

1106
02:08:09,048 --> 02:08:10,811
Gino... ?

1107
02:08:10,916 --> 02:08:13,350
Gino.

1108
02:08:13,452 --> 02:08:17,013
Last night, why did you say I had reported you ?

1109
02:08:17,122 --> 02:08:19,955
I don't know. That man...

1110
02:08:20,059 --> 02:08:23,028
What man ?

1111
02:08:23,128 --> 02:08:27,326
That man at the station. He must still be after me !

1112
02:08:44,817 --> 02:08:47,012
Giovanna ?

1113
02:09:12,111 --> 02:09:14,636
Lean against me. On my shoulder.

1114
02:09:14,747 --> 02:09:18,274
- Are you all right like this ?
- Yes, I'm fine.

1115
02:09:18,383 --> 02:09:21,216
You don't know what it's like.

1116
02:09:21,320 --> 02:09:24,812
It's not just having the baby, it's what you feel.

1117
02:09:24,923 --> 02:09:28,222
Soon I'll have a big belly.

1118
02:09:28,327 --> 02:09:31,023
I don't care if I look ugly.

1119
02:09:31,130 --> 02:09:34,361
Just the opposite. I want everybody to see.

1120
02:09:34,466 --> 02:09:37,367
- This is life, Gino.
- Yes.

1121
02:09:37,469 --> 02:09:40,438
This is life, finally.

1122
02:09:40,539 --> 02:09:43,303
Far away from that house.

1123
02:09:45,944 --> 02:09:50,643
They'll be there by now. They'll search every room.

1124
02:09:50,749 --> 02:09:53,650
If they catch us ?

1125
02:09:53,752 --> 02:09:56,721
You couldn't be with me anymore, Gino.

1126
02:09:56,822 --> 02:09:58,983
Don't worry about it.

1127
02:09:59,091 --> 02:10:01,525
You'll see. Everything will be all right.

1128
02:10:01,627 --> 02:10:03,424
Good luck will be with us.

1129
02:10:03,529 --> 02:10:06,521
It will not abandon the two of us, waiting a baby.

1130
02:10:06,632 --> 02:10:10,159
Don't worry. From now on, I'll take care of everything.

1131
02:10:17,376 --> 02:10:20,504
Where did the boss go ?

1132
02:10:20,612 --> 02:10:22,375
To Scatovari.

1133
02:10:22,481 --> 02:10:24,415
Scatovari ?

1134
02:10:24,516 --> 02:10:26,677
- Did they take the car ?
- Yes.

1135
02:10:26,785 --> 02:10:29,879
Let's go. Let's not waste any time.

1136
02:11:09,027 --> 02:11:11,791
We have to take our time behind this truck.

1137
02:11:11,897 --> 02:11:15,731
Try to pass. The fumes make me sick.

1138
02:11:15,834 --> 02:11:17,893
Close the window.

1139
02:11:25,744 --> 02:11:29,805
You know, from now on you'll have to take special care.

1140
02:11:29,915 --> 02:11:32,509
I've heard of women that had problems...

1141
02:11:32,618 --> 02:11:35,815
because they exerted themselves.

1142
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:39,000
But nothing will happen to me !

1143
02:11:39,200 --> 02:11:45,500
Why worry about getting bigger each day ?

1144
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,500
Right, Gino ?

1145
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:54,500
Stop !

1146
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:05,500
Bring the car !

1147
02:13:39,500 --> 02:13:42,000
Gino Costa...

1148
02:13:43,700 --> 02:13:46,000
let's go.
