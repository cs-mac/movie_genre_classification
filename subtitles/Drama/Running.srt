00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,600
(Gunshot)

2
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,240
Come on... Come on, kid!

3
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,120
Don 't...

4
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,560
We're gonna make it. Fuck!

5
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,000
Come on, Oleg. Stay with me!

6
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,240
Come on!

7
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,080
We're gonna make it.

8
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,320
We're gonna crash!

9
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,080
(Gunshot)

10
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,360
We're good.

11
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,560
It's all looking very good.

12
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,880
Nobody fucking moves!
Get down on the ground.

13
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,680
- Get down.
- Now, you cocksuckers!

14
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,960
You heard him! Get down!

15
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,880
You're making the biggest mistake...

16
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,520
Shut up! Down, motherfuckers!

17
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,320
Everybody! Eat the fucking floor!

18
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,680
Now, very fucking carefully

19
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,240
reach into your jackets and take out
whatever you're packing

20
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,280
and slide it under the bed.

21
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,640
<i>Come on! All of you! Move it!</i>

22
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,720
Come on, fuckheads! Keep it moving. Now!

23
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,840
You better spend it real quick, shit bags.

24
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,880
<i>You ain 't long for this fucking world</i>

25
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,680
Yeah, right,
I'll be sure to have a Mai Tai on you.

26
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,760
On all you goombah fucks.

27
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,800
Ja, man. I'll have one on you too.

28
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,120
- Go, go, go! Come on!
- Move! Move! Move!

29
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,640
Hurry up! Get going! Move!

30
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,480
<i>Let's go! Let's go!</i>

31
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,120
<i>Come on</i>

32
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,440
<i>Come on Now!</i>

33
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,120
(Screams)

34
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,200
Motherfucker!

35
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,640
No, man.

36
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,480
We don 't give a fuck about these niggers.

37
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,200
Now, you spill Perello blood,
you're deep six invested.

38
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,280
Walk clean.

39
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,240
Piss on Perello blood. Fuck him!

40
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,680
I don 't think so.

41
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,320
Son of a bitch!

42
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,640
(Shouting and screaming)

43
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,000
<i>I don 't give up you fuck!</i>

44
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,960
What? Where you going, you fuck?
We can work this out. Let's talk.

45
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,920
Fuck you!

46
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,920
Shut... the fuck up!

47
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,440
Where the fuck you reaching? Huh?

48
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,520
Please...

49
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,080
Tell you what, have a Mai Tai on me, huh?

50
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,640
(Shoots)

51
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,840
Fuck me. He's a cop!

52
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,080
<i>A fucking cop!</i>

53
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,040
<i>Motherfucker!</i>

54
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,080
Get the shit and let's go. Now!

55
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,400
Hurry the fuck up!

56
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,240
(Police siren wails)

57
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,960
<i>Fucking dirty mooks</i>

58
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,320
Is there one fucking honest cop
in this fucking city?

59
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,400
Joey.

60
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,640
Give me your gun.

61
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,440
Take this shit and get rid of it,
and do me a favour.

62
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,480
Don 't fuck it up.

63
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,600
M ovo!

64
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,400
Novo r, d ckwad!

65
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,320
Sorry. Are you OK?

66
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,480
Oh, shit. I didn 't mean to do that.

67
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,720
Hey, boss.

68
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,640
You whacking off to the E channel again? Huh?

69
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,400
(Door buzzer)

70
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,160
Just wanna smell you. Just like that.

71
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,840
You didn 't call, you son of a bitch.

72
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,640
Let me guess.
My pearls you've been promising?

73
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,640
It's nothing, just a little recycling.

74
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,760
Joey, come on.

75
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,240
If Tommy ever found out about that...

76
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,480
Ssh.

77
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,480
Just remember,
it's just our little insurance policy, all right?

78
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,640
Cos there's no way in hell I'm gonna be
thinking about getting some of this...

79
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,680
Iooking at you through some glass window.
There's no fuckin ' way.

80
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,800
Now Joey, come o n No, n o, n o, n o

81
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,640
No. No!

82
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,480
Come on, baby. Baby, look at me.

83
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,960
- What?
- Nicky's around.

84
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,480
Nicky's busy.
I'll be quick and real quiet, come on.

85
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,000
Quiet? I don 't think so. Quick, I can believe.

86
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,440
- You know something, Mrs G?
- What?

87
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,440
You're bad.

88
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

89
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,960
- I've got a rep.
- Yeah? You got a rep?

90
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,480
You got a cruisey rep?

91
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,560
I heard she likes to make it
on washing machines.

92
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,560
On select occasions. What else?

93
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,680
Oh, no, no, no. My sauce!

94
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,160
- My sauce is burning!
- Wait, that's how I like it!

95
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,600
Yeah.

96
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,240
- "Fuck! Come on!"
- Hey!

97
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,080
You use language like that,
you ain 't getting no after-dinner dessert.

98
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,720
Go find Nicky.
I think he's up in the bedroom with Oleg.

99
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,560
Why's he always with that Russky kid?
Don 't he have no other friends?

100
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,720
Joey, you know, they get along. It's fine.
What do you want?

101
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,560
I don 't want him going over there no more.
That's what I want.

102
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,600
I know. He knows.

103
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,680
He knows.

104
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,440
I'll go get him.

105
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,720
Yo, Nick. Dinner.

106
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,640
(Clatter)
- Oh, shit.

107
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,320
Come on.

108
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,960
Get down.

109
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,480
(Clears throat) Dinner.

110
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,560
Can Oleg stay?

111
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,000
It's already been three times this week.

112
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,120
I'm sure his mom would like to have him home.

113
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,600
It's OK. I'm not even hungry.

114
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,160
I'll see you tomorrow. Go Razors.

115
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,200
You, go wash up. Those hands are scary.

116
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,720
Good night, Oleg.

117
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,200
Good night, Mrs Gazelle.

118
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,160
He's not even up there.

119
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,200
They turned the basement
into a sports complex again.

120
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:18,000
- How many times am I supposed to tell him?
- What do you want? They're just boys.

121
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,360
Dad, I won 't do it again, I swear.

122
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,160
Don 't you expect me to make book on that.

123
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,160
Now, go get your grandfather.

124
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,200
I just washed my hands.

125
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,120
All right.

126
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,160
Hey, Nick.

127
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,480
Razors and Blues Friday night. 120 yellow, pal.

128
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,520
No way!

129
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,880
It's gonna be a death match
between Chester and Erlich!

130
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,560
They're going home in body bags!

131
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,600
Red ice!

132
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,320
Hey, can Oleg come?

133
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,280
He's never been to one game, and he's...

134
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,840
Not this time.
Sal could only score me a pair of tickets.

135
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,520
Maybe next time, though.

136
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,880
Go get your grandfather.

137
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,160
<i>Come on Get up</i>

138
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,560
<i>Come on</i>

139
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,960
<i>(Gunshot)</i>

140
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,720
Come on, man. Make it different this time.

141
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,760
<i>(Gunshots)</i>

142
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,040
Get up.

143
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,960
Get up.

144
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,160
I said, get up!

145
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,320
What is this?

146
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,320
Wolfgang Puck. It's your favourite.

147
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,360
It's thick crust, you damn blyad.

148
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,120
I cut off crust for you. It will be better.

149
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,800
Bring me out a Moskova.

150
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,160
Hey. Hey.

151
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,280
Come here.

152
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,320
<i>Come here</i>

153
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,960
<i>Come</i>

154
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,360
Watch this.

155
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,840
John Wayne in The Cowboys.

156
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,600
I don 't like cowboys.

157
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,640
Come on.

158
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,680
It's the Duke.

159
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,520
Come, sit.

160
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,600
When I was growing up in Kishinev

161
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,680
we had no VHS, no DVD back then.

162
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,440
I remember...

163
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,720
I did a job for this friend of my father.

164
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,360
I pick-pocketed a key off this apparatchik.

165
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:22,880
The man gave me as a reward
this children 's projector.

166
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,920
It came with three films.

167
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:30,920
Speedy Gonzales, Tarzan Of The Apes,
John Wayne in The Cowboys.

168
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,320
I watched that thing a thousand times.

169
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,120
Anzor, it's getting cold.

170
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,320
I was nine years old.

171
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,560
I didn 't know how long movies
were supposed to be.

172
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:56,360
My version of The Cowboys,
it was only 10 minutes long.

173
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,000
No John Wayne getting shot.

174
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,280
Because it was for kids, they left that part out.

175
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:10,480
I didn 't know this... until I arrive in America

176
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,840
and see it on TV for the first time.

177
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,720
I hate it. I want my 8mm back.

178
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,320
Because on that one, the Duke lives.

179
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,920
Some things were better in the old place.

180
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,760
Not too many. Some things.

181
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,000
Let me show you from the beginning.

182
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,920
No, no, no. Not forward.

183
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,240
This part's better.

184
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,360
Without the Duke?

185
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,640
Where are you going?

186
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,680
You don 't walk out on the Duke!

187
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,200
Govnyak!

188
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,880
She said he's always distracted
and he never finishes his work,

189
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,920
and she wants to get him tested.

190
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,440
She wants to get him tested? Tested for what?

191
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,760
I think maybe er... attention disorder
or something.

192
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,360
I'm not fucking ADD.

193
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,760
Hey! You don 't use that word
in front of your mother.

194
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,680
- What's wrong with ADD?
- The other one, smartass.

195
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,200
He don 't use that word, period.

196
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,040
I don 't wanna be on medication.
You can 't make me take it.

197
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:41,000
Don 't even worry about it. There's no way in hell
anybody's gonna put you on meds, OK?

198
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,160
Tell that teacher to come to the rink
and watch him wax that puck.

199
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,800
- That's perfect concentration every time.
- That's different, Joe.

200
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,800
We're just trying to find out
what's going on with you.

201
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,560
She said some great things too.

202
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,800
She said that he's very bright,
that he's very creative.

203
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,240
You left that part out before. I like that part.

204
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,280
I got potential.

205
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,680
You taking a collection down there?

206
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,960
He must eat.

207
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,400
The little prick insults the Duke...

208
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,280
...he don 't eat in this house.

209
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,600
You hear me, you little snot face?

210
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,320
Stay in your room!

211
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,360
Jerk off to your fucking Razors!

212
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,640
<i>Faggot!</i>

213
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,360
He's a growing boy.

214
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,040
What did I fucking say, sukka?

215
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,840
He has to eat, Anzor.

216
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,360
Please.

217
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,440
Who puts food on this fucking table?

218
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,920
Not you, blyad.

219
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,800
I'm the big man of this house.

220
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,800
When I say the little shit don 't eat, he don 't eat.

221
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,840
Anzor.

222
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,360
John Wayne was a faggot.

223
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,320
So Vicki Gilleto told me she saw you walking
hand in hand with Jeannie's daughter.

224
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,360
- The fat one?
(Gunshot)

225
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,120
Sounded like a gun.

226
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,080
Hey, Nick, throw me some bread.

227
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,480
Oh, shit, get down! Get down!

228
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,880
Are you OK? You OK?

229
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,320
Jesus, Joe. What the hell?

230
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,120
Stay here. Motherfucker.

231
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,880
- Motherfucker! I'll kill that fucking piece of shit.
- Where are you going?

232
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,840
You Russian piece of shit!

233
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,720
Fucking cunt.

234
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,040
Shoot my fucking house.
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

235
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,360
Dad, wait!

236
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,880
Get back in the house.
Get back in the house!

237
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,480
Get back in now! Go!

238
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,520
(Gunshot)

239
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,040
Don 't you move.

240
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,200
You piece of shit.

241
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,840
- I'm gonna fucking kill you!
- Nick, get inside.

242
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,960
Joe. Joe! What's the matter with you?

243
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,240
I just called 911. Leave it for the cops!

244
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,400
There's a kid in here! Get back in the...

245
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,040
I'm gonna kill you! Open the fucking door!

246
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,080
- Oleg's my friend!
- Get inside.

247
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,400
- Open the door.
- Joey, don 't be a damn hero!

248
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,240
Open up! It's Joey Gazelle from next door!
Open up!

249
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,280
Open up.

250
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,440
Get back. You get back.

251
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,520
Where is he? Is he upstairs?

252
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,960
- His room.
- What?

253
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,000
- His room.
- Get down.

254
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,160
What the fuck?

255
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,600
Where's the kid? Huh?

256
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,920
- Where's the kid?
- Fuck him. I'm the one who's shot.

257
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,960
Who is it? Is he still in the house?

258
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,720
The little snotfuck ran out back.

259
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,920
Oleg?

260
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,440
Oleg? What are you trying to say?
Oleg shot you?

261
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,480
What are you?

262
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,520
A fucking idiot?

263
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,560
I didn 't do this to myself.

264
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,240
The little prick would've done me too.

265
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,200
Look at him.

266
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,600
(Soundless)

267
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,560
(Gunshot)

268
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,560
(Shot)

269
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,120
Jesus, it's a fucking miracle.

270
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,680
Where'd he get the fucking piece?

271
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,840
- Fuck should I know?
- What, it wasn 't yours?

272
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,880
No! No way!

273
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,040
I got a.357 in the safe out back.

274
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,880
He had some fucking snub-nose thing.

275
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,040
Silver. Chrome.

276
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,360
Bullshit! Now you tell me.
I'm not playing around.

277
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,120
We saw where you put the gun
but he didn 't take anything.

278
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,560
- Not with me.
- Well, he went back, Nicky.

279
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,000
I didn 't know. I swear I didn 't know.

280
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,480
Come here. Listen to me. Listen to me.

281
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,600
That piece? That's not just any hot piece.

282
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,600
- Tommy used it to burn a dirty cop.
- Oh, no. Joe...

283
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,520
Yeah. Listen.
On top of it, that kid's out there right now.

284
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:17,360
The cops are on their way. If they find the gun,
or they find the kid and he talks, I'm dead.

285
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,360
- Fuck!
- Calm down. Calm down.

286
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,160
Calm down. We can get to him.

287
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,160
- You can get to the gun before the cops do.
- Oh, shit.

288
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,200
(Sirens)

289
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,640
Hey.

290
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,480
- Where are you gonna take him?
- Memorial.

291
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,960
Hey, Mila, you should go with him.

292
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:47,120
I'm gonna look for Oleg.
Me and Nicky are gonna go find him, OK?

293
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,640
I'll get Teresa to stay here
in case he comes back.

294
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,200
- You should go.
- Thanks, Joey.

295
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,920
- Yeah, no problem.
- I'm sorry.

296
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,440
We're gonna find him. Don 't worry about it.

297
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,480
(Police sirens)

298
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,120
Motherfuck.

299
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,600
(Car doors slam)

300
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,640
Come on.

301
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,040
(Door opens)

302
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,640
Police officers. Sir, do you live here?

303
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,680
No. No, actually I live next door.

304
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,280
I heard gunshots,
so I came to see what's going on.

305
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,040
- What did you see?
- Er...

306
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,440
I saw Anzor, my neighbour, in the kitchen.
He'd been shot.

307
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,280
- See who did it?
- No, he was screaming in Russian.

308
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,000
His wife asked me to stick around for the kid.

309
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,040
- You don 't know who shot him?
- No.

310
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,720
I'm gonna need to take a statement outside.

311
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,840
I can 't have you messing up the scene.

312
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,880
Hey, check it out.

313
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,560
I don 't see nothing inside.
Maybe all the way back.

314
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,920
Forget it. Leave it for Forensics.

315
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,400
Sir, I need for you to wait outside.

316
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,320
All right. No problem.

317
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,120
I'm fucking having a heart attack.

318
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:17,360
- Breathe.
- I gotta find this kid. I gotta find this kid tonight.

319
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,640
Nick, I need to know places.
Ineed to know hideouts.

320
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,400
Go to your room and make a list.
Nick, make a list!

321
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,520
- OK.
- I'm not fucking around, Nick.

322
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,680
Joe, just take it easy.

323
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,040
There's no fucking time!

324
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,920
I want you to wait next door.

325
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,960
The second he shows up, call me.

326
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,280
I can 't have to keep fucking talking to the cops.

327
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,920
You understand me?
The fucking gun is on the street.

328
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,360
This whole fucking thing's about to blow up.

329
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,920
<i>If Tommy or any of those fucking guys</i>
<i>find out about it I'm a dead man</i>

330
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,960
<i>You gotta fucking help me</i>

331
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,640
Yeah, if I fucking have to.

332
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,920
Grab your jacket. We're going for a ride.

333
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,800
All right, Nick.
I want you to stay in the car, all right?

334
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,560
Don 't get out for anything.

335
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,680
If I'm not back in one hour, call your mother.
She'll come and get you, OK?

336
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,760
Excuse me.

337
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,640
Who's in the other room?
Is that Yugorsky, gunshot victim?

338
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,880
Teenager. DUI car wreck.
I think they just lost a GSW in 3.

339
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,160
Lost?

340
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,120
- He's dead?
- Yeah.

341
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,240
No, wait, he took a bullet right here.

342
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,160
No, major trauma to chest.
He's been in surgery all day.

343
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,040
The guy was a cop.

344
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,560
Oh, wait. Yeah, they did bring someone in
about 40 minutes ago.

345
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,760
OR number 2. He's gone upstairs already.

346
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,920
That's this way?

347
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,480
Can I help you, Dr Donaldson?

348
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,440
Yeah, the cops are waiting outside.

349
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,840
They need to run a match on this bullet asap.

350
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,560
I'll make sure they get it right away.

351
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,360
Excuse me.

352
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,520
You looking for this? Yugorsky? GSW shoulder?

353
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,560
You gotta help me find him, Nick.

354
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,200
- What are you gonna do to him?
- I'm not gonna do nothing.

355
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,920
I just need to get my gun back
and bring him home.

356
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,000
You sure?

357
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,600
Talk to me, Nick.

358
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,200
<i>There's this old abandoned rec centre</i>
<i>in the park</i>

359
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:51,360
"Me and" O"leg would hang out there sometimes"
<i>read comics</i>

360
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,280
<i>He might be there</i>

361
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,240
Nice gun.

362
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,600
Detective Rydell, Narcotics.

363
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,440
I already made a statement.

364
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,560
Fucking niggers all look the same.

365
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,080
Yeah. Anzor Yugorsky.

366
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,120
Any relation to lvan Yugorsky?

367
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,640
My uncle.

368
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,080
The Czar of Brighton Beach.
I've been to his club a couple of times.

369
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,480
Nice joint.

370
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,520
He even sang a few songs.

371
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,720
He sings like a fucking toad.

372
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:57,440
Well, Sinatra he's not,
but he's a man with a serious reputation.

373
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,520
- He has a lot of enemies.
- Bullshit.

374
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,040
I told you it was just some fucking crackhead.

375
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,720
Yeah. Well, I spoke to the officers on the scene.

376
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,720
There was no sign of forced entry.

377
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,360
But they did find some interesting shit out back.

378
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,600
Six cases of NyQuil,
and it ain 't even cold season.

379
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,960
What do you think a search warrant's
gonna turn up?

380
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,680
- Come on. Where?
- It's this way.

381
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,400
Let's go. Come on.

382
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,800
Come on.

383
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,360
Go, go, go.

384
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,840
This way.

385
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:04,880
(Man whispers)
Be cool. And let me do all the talking.

386
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,480
I'm gonna get you out of here.

387
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,680
- Help you?
- Yeah.

388
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,040
How much you got?

389
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,440
Oh, I got a lot.

390
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,960
Yes.

391
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,920
Oleg, it's Nicky. Are you in there?

392
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,600
- This the spot?
- Mm.

393
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,080
Hey, where's the stash?

394
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,120
Last stall, motherfucker.

395
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,800
Find the stash. Find it.

396
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,000
Go on. Find it.

397
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,000
(Shouts) Find it!

398
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,560
We're gonna search this entire park.
He might still be around.

399
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,280
What the fuck do you think you're doin ',
white boy?

400
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,720
All right, drop it, or I'll fucking waste the midget.
Come on!

401
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:28,400
Go ahead. He's just a tag-along.

402
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,440
Plug 'em, Dell. Fuck it, man! Fuck 'em up.

403
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,880
(Confused shouting)

404
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,600
(Multiple gunshots)

405
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,360
All right, stay right by me.

406
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,120
Right here. Against the wall.

407
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,320
Don 't you move. Stay right there.

408
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,200
I didn 't do nothing, Officer. I just came to...

409
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,680
Put your fucking head
against the fucking stall.

410
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,600
Put your fucking head there!

411
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,600
Oleg.

412
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,120
I told you to stay outside.

413
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,800
- Did you find him?
- Get the fuck outside! Get out of here!

414
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,280
I'm talking to you! What did you see?

415
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,440
Find a gun? You find a silver gun?
Did you find a fucking silver gun?

416
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,760
I-I-I got no gun.

417
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,960
(Snarls)

418
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,080
(Barking)

419
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,520
You wanna study for the GED? Here.

420
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,800
Look what you done to my fucking ride, bitch.

421
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,440
Jesus, please, baby. Please.

422
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:02,640
I've only been taking one class.
One class two hours a week.

423
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,760
I still got time to be pulling tricks.

424
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,880
Three Gs I fronted you
for these fucking airbags.

425
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,400
And what do I get in return?

426
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,280
- Fucking night school?
- I'll quit!

427
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,760
I'm super proud of you
for showing some initiative.

428
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,080
Maybe I'll even come to your graduation.

429
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:21,320
But first you're gonna give me back
my fucking property.

430
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,040
(Gun cocks)

431
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,400
You learn how to use that
watching Sesame Street?

432
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,840
You ain 't even holding it right.

433
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,400
What's the matter, kid? You got the shakes?

434
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,400
(Clicks)

435
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Whoops.

436
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,320
Now I'm gonna put a smile on your face, boy.

437
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,680
Cheek to cheek.

438
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,160
You're gonna be the happiest little brat
in school.

439
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,720
Say cheese.

440
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:03,160
Who's laughing now, you fucking grey meat
limp-dick motherfucker?

441
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,440
M ac Daddy!

442
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,560
You got some cojones, kid.

443
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,400
(Drops pipe)

444
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,120
(Coughs)

445
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,160
(Gasps for breath)

446
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,360
Let me see your fingers, son.

447
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,920
Is this... Hey! Is this your son?

448
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,360
I'm taking care of him tonight, OK?

449
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,520
Unless you have the number of his doctor
and I can get a prescription over the phone,

450
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,280
you'll have to take him to Emergency.

451
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:47,440
- If you want me to call you a cab...
- I don 't need no fucking cab!

452
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,040
Ineed some spray shit for him!

453
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:52,680
That spray shit is a controlled substance,
ma'am, so what can I tell you?

454
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:57,520
- Keep the change.
- I can 't... This is stupid. I can 't do this.

455
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,680
Listen, why don 't we go in the back
and talk about it, OK?

456
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,160
- Look, lady...
- I'll take care of you.

457
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,240
- There's nothing I can do, lady.
- There's nothing you can do?

458
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,600
- Take him to Emergency.
- OK.

459
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,920
OK.

460
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,360
Nothing you can fucking do?

461
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:17,200
Get what he needs. Now.

462
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,920
- It's Beclovent.
- Yeah, I know.

463
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,040
Beclovent, bitch!

464
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,200
Come on, let's just go back.

465
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,600
No.

466
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,720
If he turns up, your mom's gonna call.

467
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,480
(Phone rings)

468
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,720
Tee.

469
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,360
Sal.

470
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,360
Yeah.

471
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:45,440
- Do girls really get naked in there?
- You'll find out when you're 21.

472
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,920
I've seen Mom naked. It's no big deal.

473
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,720
Trust me on this one. It's always a big deal.

474
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,480
Stay here.

475
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,760
What?

476
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,960
It's taken care of.

477
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,000
Oh. It's taken care of. Lucky us.

478
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,600
RYDELL: "Guys sit down Have a seat"

479
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,640
Don 't be shy.

480
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:45,880
They make a good Mai Tai for a twat bar,
but seriously overpriced.

481
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,480
Two million dollars for a round of drinks.

482
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,520
And the pussy ain 't even that hot.

483
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:55,480
Jody, I'm doin ' business here.
Jody! Come on, get the fuck out of here.

484
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,080
Two million dollars.

485
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,880
Suck a dick, you prick bastard.
You don 't have shit on us.

486
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,800
What do you think of this?

487
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:05,560
Cops never found these at the scene.
Just two dead narcs and three dead Jamaicans.

488
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,440
Ballistics is gonna reveal the slugs
that killed my partners

489
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,440
didn 't come from the Jamaicans.

490
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,520
So there were others involved.

491
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,440
As for myself... erm... I was never there.

492
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,360
Well...

493
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,520
dead guys tell no tales.

494
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,920
Yeah. Why don 't you ask your pal here?

495
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,520
What the fuck you talkin ' about?

496
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,320
You blew my partner Stevie's balls off
with a.38 snub nose.

497
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,320
A real distinctive piece.

498
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,200
Stainless. Polished up like a spic's hubcap.

499
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,600
Now, let me take a wild guess here.

500
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,680
<i>I think you gave him the gun</i>
<i>to dump in the river</i>

501
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:45,000
<i>Now I'm assuming that he never</i>
<i>got around to it because two hours ago</i>

502
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,480
<i>his next-door neighbour</i>
<i>took a slug in the shoulder</i>

503
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:50,360
The shooter was the guy's 10-year-old stepson.

504
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,800
Who was over at Gazelle's house
two hours earlier.

505
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,040
What the fuck you tryin ' to do here? Huh?

506
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,440
You tryin ' to fuckin ' play us?

507
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,760
You're wasting your time, and this is bullshit.

508
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,800
Bullshit? Bullshit, huh?

509
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,640
This punk, Anzor Yugorsky?

510
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:06,200
He describes the gun to me in vivid detail.

511
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:10,040
Makes mention it's a snub nose
with a serious shine to it.

512
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:14,400
- The fuck is this guy talkin ' about?
- He's talkin ' about a fuckin ' shiny gun.

513
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,200
Big deal. There's a thousand on the street.
It ain 't the piece.

514
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,880
Oh, yeah? What were you doing at the hospital
when they brought Yugorsky in? Huh?

515
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,120
<i>Sniffing around Emergency</i>

516
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,520
<i>You know what I figure?</i>

517
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,720
<i>I figure you were there to pull a switch</i>
<i>on the slug they took out of him</i>

518
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,720
My wife asked me to go to the hospital.

519
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,000
She was concerned, in a neighbourly way.
She wanted me...

520
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:37,360
All right, you know what? Enough bullshit.
I expect to find a bag...

521
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,000
in this locker at Down Neck Station by midnight.

522
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,840
If the bag is not there one minute after,

523
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,320
I'm taking you all down any fuckin ' way I can.

524
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,440
<i>Even if I have to manufacture the case</i>

525
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,160
And you know I will.
Cos I got the toughest mob in the world.

526
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,200
I'm the law.

527
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,360
(Roar of car engine)

528
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,120
(Screech of tyres)

529
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,000
Right, stay put. I'm gonna grab you a burger.

530
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:15,640
- I'm not hungry.
- You didn 't finish dinner, I'll grab you something.

531
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,680
Stay here.

532
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,400
Dad?

533
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,760
Don 't go in there. Let's just go home.

534
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,680
It's gonna be all right.

535
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,840
No, it's not.

536
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,400
- Hey, Frankie. How you doing?
- Hey. How are ya?

537
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,440
- It's good to see you.
- Sit, Joe.

538
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,080
- How you doin,' guys?
- Hi, Joey.

539
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,000
How you doing?

540
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,400
- You want some coffee, or somethin ' to eat?
- Nah, I'm good.

541
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,120
But I got my boy waiting out in the car.

542
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,640
- I wanna get him a burger.
- Tony, take care of that.

543
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,880
Yeah, Tony, get him some fries
and a strawberry shake.

544
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,040
Don 't scare him. He don 't know you're coming.

545
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,240
<i>So Joe</i>

546
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,160
I got off the phone with lvan
about this thing with his nephew.

547
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,680
I told you, it's not the fuckin ' piece.

548
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:09,200
Look, everybody knows the nephew
is a brain -fried reprobate.

549
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,160
Yeah, whatever. He's a tweaker piece of shit.

550
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,440
And he's cooking meth in his backyard.

551
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,360
It's just a matter of time
before he blows up the neighbourhood.

552
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:19,800
We know this.
But it's a sensitive issue with me, Joe.

553
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,560
I'm in bed with Yugorsky on this gasoline deal.

554
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,400
Hey.

555
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,640
It's a good deal.

556
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,160
- I don 't wanna rock the boat.
- Oh, fuck that.

557
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,320
Fuck those Russian cunts. Huh?

558
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,600
Pop, it's the fuckin ' narc
that's got his dick in our ass.

559
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,600
Hey.

560
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,880
<i>Calm down Tommy</i>

561
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,840
You see, Joe, the tweaker's got it in his head

562
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,920
that maybe you were looking to knock him
out of the cooking business

563
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,920
and helped the boy out.

564
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,480
Made a piece available to him.

565
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,520
I would never use a kid to do something like that.

566
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,320
Never.

567
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,360
All right, all right, look.

568
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:01,200
Made a po rsso n a roassssu ra n co to Yugo rssky

569
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,400
that I will have my entire crew in the street
out looking for that kid.

570
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,600
Now, in the interest of professional harmony...

571
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,040
...I think we all wanna get our story straight.

572
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,080
<i>You agree don 't you Joe?</i>

573
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,720
One hamburger and you're out of my life.
That's it.

574
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,640
Oleg.

575
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,880
Oh shit!

576
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,440
Hey, kid.

577
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,680
How you doing?
Your old man sent this stuff out for you.

578
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,200
Thanks.

579
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:38,240
Ain 't it a little late for you to be out?
I have twins your age. They're in bed by now.

580
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,720
What are you, like, nine?

581
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,480
Ten.

582
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,760
And a half.

583
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,200
I gotta go to the bathroom.

584
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,520
Hey, Joey.

585
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,880
Looks like your kid don 't listen too well.

586
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,960
Must run in the family.

587
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,600
Hey, Nicky. Get over here.

588
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,640
<i>Get over here</i>

589
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,160
What you doing? I told you to wait in the car.

590
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,760
- I had to go to the bathroom.
- How you doing, Nicky?

591
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,840
Want some Gummy Bears?

592
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,800
Hey, Nicky.

593
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,640
You wouldn 't by chance...

594
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,760
<i>know where your friend got that gun?</i>

595
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,320
Would ya?

596
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,160
No.

597
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,760
I have to go to the bathroom.

598
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,800
- OK
- Nick, you go to the bathroom.

599
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,680
Have you decided yet?

600
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,440
I have a bus to catch and... Oh, no!

601
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:49,040
I'll have a cheeseburger and a Coke.

602
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,520
I gotta go to the bathroom.

603
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,680
Don 't worry, we're gonna take care of the cop.

604
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,720
- I know.
- OK.

605
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,840
NICK: Where is it?

606
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,800
Hey, Nick.

607
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,360
- Where the hell are you?
- Almost done.

608
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,880
Razors with razors.

609
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,920
(Toilet flushes)

610
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,080
Come on, wash your hands.
We gotta get out of here. Come on.

611
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,200
Fuck!

612
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,360
Hey, sweetie. How you doing?

613
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,720
All right, Nick, listen to me.

614
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,160
I want you to think about
where your friend might be,

615
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,840
because the others are looking for him
and if they find him...

616
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:03,120
- They won 't find the gun.
- What did you say?

617
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,360
What did you say?

618
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,720
Don 't mess with me.
I want you to fuckin ' talk to me now.

619
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,920
- Promise me you won 't hurt him.
- I don 't have time for this shit.

620
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,720
- Now fuckin ' tell me.
- Promise.

621
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,800
Promise you what? What? I promise.
I swear to God!

622
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,040
I'm not gonna hurt your friend!
Come on. Tell me.

623
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,120
Just tell me what you know.

624
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,160
(Tyres screech)

625
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,240
(Whispers) Come on.

626
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,760
(Low moaning)

627
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:54,520
This one here?

628
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,560
(Man coughs)

629
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,560
(Man exhales heavily)

00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:10,880
(Toilet flushes)

631
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,720
Where is it?
I thought you said you put it in there.

632
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,640
- I did. I put it right...
- Then where is it?

633
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:42,360
- I thought you said you put it in the tank.
- I put it in here!

634
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:43,600
Oh, shit.

635
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,120
Which one did you put it in, Nick? Huh?

636
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,160
Which one did you put it in?

637
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,920
Goddamn it, Nicky.

638
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,240
Why did you lie to me? Why did you lie to me?

639
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:58,720
I didn 't.

640
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,760
- Why did you lie to me?
- I'm not...

641
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:03,720
- Why did you lie to me?
- I'm not fucking lying! I put it in there!

642
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:06,560
You just fuckin ' killed me, Nick.

643
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,600
You just fuckin ' killed me!

644
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,480
I want you to keep an eye open.

645
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:57,400
If you see anybody coming,
I want you to cough really loud, all right?

646
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:05,760
(Voices, Nick coughs)

647
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,680
- You're like a broken record.
- I'm telling you, you gotta see this thing.

648
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,720
You better not be jerking my chain.

649
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:17,000
- What are you doin ' here, kid?
- I was looking for the bathroom.

650
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:20,400
- Even the kid thinks it's a shithole back here.
- Shut up, Ralphie.

651
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,760
All right, listen.

652
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,240
You go on out through that door,

653
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:25,240
turn left, go all the way down to the end,

654
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:27,080
turn left again, and you're there.

655
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:28,320
You got it?

656
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:34,320
- Come on.
- Er... which door?

657
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,440
CHEF: Come here, kid. Come here.

658
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,920
Hey, Yolanda. Wait up!

659
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:47,680
- "Where you going with my cheesecake?"
- "It's for paying customers Not you"

660
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,720
I've got your number, fucker.

661
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:10,320
Forget it. I ain 't dragging your butt
across no state lines.

662
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,040
(Sighs)

663
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:16,040
Look, baba, why don 't you just go home?

664
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:18,960
I bet you things are not as bad
as you think they are.

665
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:27,320
(Sighs) Come on, baba.

666
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,000
(Police siren)

667
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:32,800
Oh, mother...

668
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,320
- Hands where we can see 'em!
- (She cries out)

669
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:36,960
Over here.

670
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,000
PROSTITUTE: Run! Run, little man! Run!

671
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:45,240
Hey.

672
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:49,040
Get off! Get off!

673
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:09,560
(Rap playing on stereo)

674
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:13,080
Do you know these guys?

675
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,720
(Cellphone rings)

676
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:23,200
- Yeah.
- Babe?

677
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,960
- Where the hell are you?
- "I'm takin ' care of things"

678
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:30,840
Forget about it - they picked up Oleg
at a bus station with a hooker.

679
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:33,080
Who picked him up?

680
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:34,960
- The cops?
- Yeah.

681
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,240
Jesus Christ, this is fuckin ' bullshit.

682
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:38,760
- Hey.
- "Fuck!"

683
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:40,600
Hey! You got Nicky with you?

684
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:41,960
Yeah, he's right here.

685
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:44,400
Then stop using your mouth around him!

686
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,840
And bring my son home! Now!

687
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:50,320
Yeah. That's what I'm doing.
I'm bringing him home right now.

688
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,000
(Tyres screech)

689
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:55,080
(Drink fizzes)

690
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:02,040
Ah. Do you mind?

691
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:04,080
I'm feeling kind of parched.

692
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:08,160
Big game Friday night.

693
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:09,880
I bet you're excited about that, huh?

694
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:13,280
It's gonna be red ice,
and plenty of blue shirt body bags.

695
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:15,320
Am I right?

696
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,080
Look... I could help you, kid.

697
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:21,840
You and your mom, if need be.

698
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,320
Now I could get that prick out of your life.

699
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:27,160
Lock him up. I could do that, I'm a cop.

700
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,720
All you have to do
is tell me where you found the gun.

701
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,760
And where you stashed it.

702
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,480
That's it.

703
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:38,520
What do you say?

704
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,560
You'll let me help you.

705
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,120
Get out of here, Mila.

706
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,760
You know? Go to a shelter.

707
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:50,800
I can get you an address.

708
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:54,080
You don 't understand.

709
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,600
I belong to him.

710
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,360
No. No.

711
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,400
No, no, I don 't understand.

712
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:08,800
I was prostitute in Moscow.

713
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:17,760
Yugorsky Escort Service offered to
bring girls over with promise of big bucks.

714
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,960
We would owe 50 thousand dollars.
You know, pay back through work.

715
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,720
I take offer.

716
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:29,760
Not tell them I'm pregnant.

717
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,240
When they find out...

718
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:37,080
...they insist I have an abortion.

719
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:40,080
I tell them no.

720
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,360
They send Anzor to kill me.

721
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,360
Anzor's not a killer.

722
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:53,040
He's not... a hard man like big Yugorsky.

723
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:58,080
(Sighs) He thinks...

724
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:01,520
...he thinks he's John Wayne.

725
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:06,800
Wants to do right thing.

726
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,880
He goes against his uncle, and tells
big man Yugorsky he will pay off my debt.

727
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,200
His uncle refuses...

728
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,040
...and tells him...

729
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:22,080
he will send others to kill me.

730
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,000
Set example.

731
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,760
So Anzor make me wife.

732
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,640
Big man Yugorsky can 't kill his nephew's wife.

733
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:41,560
But he... tells Anzor to leave Little Odessa.

734
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:45,560
He's no longer working for Yugorsky family.

735
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,480
I'm gonna get you the name of a shelter.

736
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:55,520
(Car approaching, tyres screech)

737
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:03,320
(Tyres screech)

738
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,960
You OK?

739
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:10,440
This ain 't right, Joe.
He don 't need to be put through this.

740
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:13,480
Hey, Nick, I'm proud of you.
You done good, all right?

741
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:24,280
I'm gonna head up to Community Hills.

742
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:28,600
Cops don 't got the gun yet but I may have
a line on it so I'm gonna go over there.

743
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:30,880
I'm scared, Joe.

744
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:34,120
I am pissed at you, and I am scared!

745
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,160
Equal measures.

746
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:43,880
Be careful.

747
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,960
- Hey.
- Hey.

748
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:57,920
Just got word. The cops picked up the kid.

749
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,400
- "Anything you still wanna tell us?"
- Tell you what? There's nothing to tell.

750
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:04,720
- Where you headed, Joe?
- Erm...

751
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,760
I was supposed to head to the store
and pick up some milk and eggs.

752
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:10,240
In all the excitement I forgot to do it, so...

753
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:12,560
TOMM Y: Hm.

754
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,400
Yugorsky's gonna call us
when he talks to the kid.

755
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,760
<i>Don 't go too far</i>

756
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:22,080
- Later, Joe.
- Yeah, see ya.

757
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:27,320
Hey, Tee. Looking fucking good.

758
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,360
He keeps giving me this bullshit story
about finding the gun

759
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:40,720
in some abandoned locker in school.

760
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:42,280
What do you want me to do?

761
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:45,080
The little fucker shot me.
He ain 't gonna spill dick to me.

762
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:48,120
You know,
I don 't think I'm being clear enough here.

763
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:50,160
You know what I mean?

764
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:53,200
Let me be crystal clear.

765
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:58,760
You get the boy to give up Gazelle
or I'm closing shop on your tweaker ass

766
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,920
and I'm taking you down fucking hard.

767
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,600
Understand me?

768
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:04,640
(Door opens)

769
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,360
Hey, cowboy.

770
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,160
Wanna go get some ice cream?

771
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,360
(Car approaching)

772
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:35,760
Get the fuck away from my car.

773
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,960
(Angry shouting)

774
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,120
(Baby crying)

775
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,680
- Hey. Hey, I'm looking for Manny Perez.
- He's not here.

776
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:49,080
No! Oh, my God! I've never seen him.

777
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:51,360
- Manny? Where the fuck is he?
- He's not here!

778
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:54,080
- Where is he? Where is he?
- He's not here!

779
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,560
Better not fuckin ' lie to me!

780
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:57,520
- Argh!
- Where the fuck is he?

781
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:59,240
- Where is he?
- OK, OK!

782
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:01,200
- Where is he?
- He play cards at Armando's.

783
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:02,320
- Armando's?
- Uh-huh.

784
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,080
He's at Armando's. Yeah.

785
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:06,840
Get the hell out of the way! Just stay right there.

786
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:09,760
(Woman speaks rapidly in Spanish)

787
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:11,720
- (Baby wails)
JOEY: "What's your name?"

788
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:13,280
What's your name?

789
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:15,320
- Conchita.
- Conchita.

790
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:18,440
Now you listen to me, Conchita.
You listen to me real good.

791
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:20,000
- I don 't wanna hurt Manny.
- OK.

792
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:22,920
I don 't wanna hurt him,
but he has something that belongs to me.

793
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,400
- A gun. Do you know anything about a gun?
- No, no.

794
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:27,920
It's block 5, number 602. That's where he is.

795
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,320
OK. Now listen to me.

OK. You don 't call Manny.

799
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:37,720
You don 't tell Manny I'm coming.

800
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:40,960
You don 't warn him for anything,
cos if you do, I'm gonna come back here!

801
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:51,920
I can be an asshole.

802
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:56,040
You made your point.

803
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:59,200
You showed some balls.

804

You tell me... what I want to know.

Edele, I think we've picked up a stray.

- Manny, no.

Isn 't this cool, huh?
Yeah, come on. Look back in the camera.

What about you, Oleg?
You wanna be in the film as well, don 't you?

- Hurry up, though. You're missing out.
- Mm.

Do you see any... any bottles?

Some puta whose forwarding address

All of them, dumpsters.

01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:25,720
(Both laugh)

954
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:29,280
I got you covered by tomorrow night.

955
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:32,160
Hey, check this out.

956
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:36,440
Is that sweet or what? Hey!
A royal flush put her in my pocket.

957
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:39,840
- Three hundred cold puts her in mine.
- No, man. She's a beauty.

958
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:41,880
Think I'm gonna hold on to her.

959
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:44,960
Five hundred.

960
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:49,200
Al won 't miss them. Not until Cinco de Mayo.

961
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:03,280
Oh, Joe! Shit!

962
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:08,720
I'm under a lot of stress tonight,
so whatever I say don 't count.

963
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:13,840
Do I still have to go to school tomorrow?

964
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:15,880
I don 't know. We'll see.

965
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:34,160
- Remember me?
- Who the fuck are you?

966
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:37,280
You got something that belongs to me.
Snub nose.38.

967
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:39,800
You scored it off of Manny in a card game.
Ineed it back.

968
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:45,240
JOEY: Fuck!

969
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:47,480
I want my fucking gun!

970
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:49,520
<i>Who the fuck are you huh?</i>

971
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:52,280
JOEY: Don 't be fucking stupid!

972
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:54,320
Fuck!

973
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:57,600
(Curses in Spanish)

974
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:17,240
You fuck! You fuck! Where's my fucking gun?

975
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:19,240
Help me! I'm burning!

976
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:21,720
Where's my gun?
You gonna tell me where my gun is now?

977
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:25,880
If you don 't tell me where I can find it you'll have
third-degree burns. Know what that means?

978
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:28,760
No cock, asshole!
You'll have a fucking melted dick!

979
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:30,560
- I sold it to a pimp. Lester!
- A pimp?

980
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:32,600
Shit! What you waiting on for?

981
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:34,560
Where can I find him?
Where can I find him?

982
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:38,720
- I need to fucking know now!
- He booked a cab! Union Fleet. Ask them!

983
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:48,440
Stay here. Do not move.

984
01:08:58,160 --> 01:09:01,440
OLEG: I'm not touching it.
Get away from me. Fuck you!

985
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:03,720
DEZ: Ow, you little shit! Just bit me!

986
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:10,000
(Doorbell)

987
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:15,280
DEZ: Who the hell is that?
EDELE: I'll go see. Throw me my robe.

988
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:16,760
Take the kids into the bedroom.

989
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:39,160
- May I help you?
- I'm looking for Oleg.

990
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:42,400
- Oleg. You must have the wrong address.
- No. He's a ten -year-old boy.

991
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:44,640
He's pale. He never smiles.

992
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:47,640
He's my neighbour's kid.
He called me from this apartment.

993
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:49,880
Owens Park Lane, apartment 303.

994
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:52,160
Well, he must have given you
the wrong address.

995
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:54,360
Or maybe you heard wrong. There's no Oleg.

996
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:56,760
He said that he was being held against his will.

997
01:09:56,840 --> 01:10:00,560
That's ridiculous. There's only my husband
and my two children inside.

998
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:03,040
- No-one else. And it's late.
- Well...

999
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:05,720
I would like to take a look inside
to satisfy my curiosity.

1000
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:08,160
This is absurd.
Are you suggesting I kidnapped Oleg?

1001
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:12,680
You know what? I'm gonna call the police.
I'm gonna stand here waiting for them to arrive.

1002
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:14,920
When all's you gotta do is just let me in.

1003
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:18,400
If you must.

1004
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:35,880
- Do you mind?
- Go right ahead.

1005
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:41,400
The children 's room is on the right.

1006
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:43,240
They are asleep.

1007
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:45,280
Please go right in.

1008
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:49,680
(Exhales heavily)

1009
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:58,440
- Hello.
- Don 't ask, it's too ridiculous.

1010
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:00,480
Sorry, I'm really embarrassed.

1011
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:04,720
Excuse me,
but I seriously doubt he's hiding in there.

1012
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,960
(Dez mouths)

1013
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:19,920
- What's through here?
- Playroom.

1014
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:24,960
Whoa.

1015
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:27,080
Wow.

1016
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:29,280
You guys got your own little Disneyland in here.

1017
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:33,560
Well, it's all about the children.
And as you can see, there's no Oleg.

1018
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:46,280
I really hope that you find him.

1019
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:48,480
You hear too many stories these days.

1020
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:52,960
- God only knows if it were our children.
- If it were your children... photographs.

1021
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:55,000
- Excuse me!
- Photographs.

1022
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:58,280
No photographs.

1023
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:01,800
If they were your children, you would have...

1024
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:04,600
at least one photograph
somewhere in this apartment.

1025
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:08,120
This is ridiculous! We only moved
into this place. Everything's in storage.

1026
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:11,560
Now I really must ask you to leave! I insist!

1027
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:14,680
Oleg?

1028
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:19,280
(Dez and Edele whispering)

1029
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:31,880
Oh, man. This is too much.

1030
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:34,440
It's too much.

1031
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:37,040
- It's like some kind of a lure.
- You're making a mistake.

1032
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:38,480
Tell her to leave, Dez.

1033
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:41,560
Ma'am, if you don 't leave right now,
I'm calling the police.

1034
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:45,360
Call them. Call them. And mention you've got
two abducted children in the next room.

1035
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:49,080
Two children who don 't appear
in any photographs in this house.

1036
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:51,520
- Where is Oleg?
- How dare you suggest that we...

1037
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,040
Oh...

1038
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:55,080
Where's the boy?

1039
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:58,040
(Screams) Where is he?

1040
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:13,960
Oh, my God. Oh...

1041
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:16,000
You better pray he's not dead.

1042
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:24,600
Back off, you sick fuck!

1043
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:28,800
Jesus. Oh, God, help me.

1044
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:31,600
Come on, come on, come on.

1045
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:39,040
I said back the fuck up!

1046
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:41,920
You sick, twisted, motherfucking cunt!

1047
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,560
Oh...

1048
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:47,680
- Oh, wake up.
- (Coughs)

1049
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:50,320
That's right. That's right.
Breathe. You're gonna be OK.

1050
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:53,000
You can breathe, Oleg. I'm right here.

1051
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:54,840
I'm right here, just breathe.

1052
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:56,880
- "That's right"
- (Oleg coughs)

1053
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:08,080
Back off!

1054
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:10,400
I said back off!

1055
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:12,440
I will blow you away!

1056
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:17,400
OK. Can you get up?

1057
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:22,360
OK. Go to the bedroom. Get the two kids.
Bring them downstairs. Nicky's there.

1058
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:25,360
All right? Wait with him. OK? Move over.

1059
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,960
Get out of his way.

1060
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:38,000
<i>I've got a safe in the bedroom</i>
<i>There's 100000 cash in there and diamonds</i>

1061
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:40,520
All you gotta do is take the boy and walk away.

1062
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:43,520
(Exhales)

1063
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:55,680
Oh, my God. Oh...

1064
01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:58,600
Oh, God.

1065
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:01,440
Oh...

1066
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:04,880
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1067
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:08,280
Oh, my God.

1068
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:11,680
Oh, you sick fucks.

1069
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:13,280
You're right. We're sick.

1070
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:16,160
<i>We are We're sick</i>
<i>This is really great This is gonna help us</i>

1071
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:18,000
- Give me your phone.
- Please, yeah.

1072
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:19,560
- What are you doing?
- She wants...

1073
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:20,960
Who are you calling?

1074
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:26,000
(Ringing tone)

1075
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:28,880
<i>911 What is the nature of your emergency?</i>

1076
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:32,920
I just heard shooting across the hall.
1456, Owens Park Lane.

1077
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
<i>What is your name ma'am?</i>

1078
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:37,720
You're not serious.

1079
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:43,240
(Thudding)

1080
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:46,120
OK.

1081
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:52,280
(Police siren)

1082
01:15:56,160 --> 01:16:00,600
Hey. Hey, listen, one of your cabs
just picked up my brother at Al's Automotive.

1083
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:02,200
Yeah, well, listen to me.

1084
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:05,240
I was supposed to pick him up,
but there's been a family emergency.

1085
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:09,560
So, what I need you to do is I need you
to find out where the cab dropped him off at.

1086
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:13,160
Yeah, call me back.
My phone number's 555-7556.

1087
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:17,360
(Cellphone rings)

1088
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:19,400
Hello? Yeah.

1089
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:22,960
Hey, wait, wait, wait. Hey, calm down.

1090
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:38,320
- What happened to your face?
- It's nothing.

1091
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:40,000
- I need to talk to you, Joe.
- Later.

1092
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:41,200
No, n ow!

1093
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:43,680
Why couldn 't you have just taken the kid
and left?

1094
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:45,760
Why couldn 't you have taken the kid and left?

1095
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:49,240
I have never seen evil before tonight, Joe.

1096
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:51,400
Real fucking evil.

1097
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:52,880
OK?

1098
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:56,800
And I know that's not what I see
when I look in your eyes.

1099
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:58,480
Thanks a lot, Tee.

1100
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:03,040
- I'm trying to make a point here.
- I know what point you're trying to make!

1101
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:06,120
I did not marry an evil man, OK?

1102
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:08,240
I did not marry an evil man.

1103
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:11,360
Shady, sleazy,
mixed up with the wrong kind of people.

1104
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:13,400
But definitely not evil.

1105
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:16,320
I know what you're trying to say, Tee.

1106
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:18,320
Do you?

1107
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:23,920
I hope so. I have turned my back
on a lot of things since we've been married.

1108
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,480
M y oyoss a ro wide opo n o n t hiss o n o

1109
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:32,120
(Blows)

1110
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:37,440
Nicky, go home with your mom.

1111
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:39,480
Oleg, let's go take a ride.

1112
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:55,120
What kind of music you listen to?

1113
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:56,640
Huh?

1114
01:17:56,720 --> 01:17:58,360
You listen to that techno shit?

1115
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:02,400
You listen to rap music? You like rap music?

1116
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:04,640
They don 't have what I listen to on the radio.

1117
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:06,040
Yeah, what's that?

1118
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:09,600
Kvasha. It's my mother's tape from Russia.

1119
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:11,360
What the fuck?

1120
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:12,560
Kvassha?

1121
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:17,160
You're American, not Russian.
Why listen to that shit?

1122
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:22,360
My mother said I started in her belly in Russia,
so I'm Russian.

1123
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:26,040
You're not a Russian, you're an American,
cos you were born in the USA.

1124
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:27,720
You're an American. An American.

1125
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:29,400
Say, "I'm an American." You say it.

1126
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:32,360
Say, "I'm an American."
Say, "I'm an American."

1127
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:34,000
- I'm an American.
- American.

1128
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:37,120
You were born in the fucking USA.
That makes you an American.

1129
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:39,960
Listen to this.

1130
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:41,760
I Don 't Want To Go Home

1131
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:44,720
He'll warm up the back seat for you
when you're ready to get laid.

1132
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:46,760
<i>You mark my words</i>

1133
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:51,240
Fucking Kvasha.

1134
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:54,920
Christ! You put me through the ringer tonight.
You know that, don 't you?

1135
01:18:57,160 --> 01:18:58,920
- Hm?
- I won 't say nothing.

1136
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,520
Yeah, what'd you say to the cops?

1137
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:04,680
- What'd you say to the cops?
- I got the gun from Stevie Monroe's locker.

1138
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:06,600
He doesn 't go there no more.

1139
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:08,240
Nicky told me to say that.

1140
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:10,000
Nicky told you to say that?

1141
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:11,440
Smart kid.

1142
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:14,040
He's my best friend.
We're gonna play for the Razors.

1143
01:19:14,120 --> 01:19:15,960
(Cellphone rings)
- Yeah?

1144
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:17,000
Hello?

1145
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:19,000
Yeah, that was me.

1146
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:20,800
The Royal Towers? How long ago?

1147
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:22,880
All right, thanks.

1148
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:26,080
Hold on. We're gonna go reclaim
some stolen property.

1149
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:28,120
(Engine growls)

1150
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:34,520
(Rap music in background)

1151
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:51,080
Don 't worry about it.
We're just gonna sit tight for a while.

1152
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:53,360
You know...

1153
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:58,120
...I used to know this kid.

1154
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:02,640
His old man was a real fucking piece of shit.

1155
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:07,680
Always drunk.

1156
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:10,680
Always smacking him and his mom around.

1157
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:18,560
This kid, he takes his licks...
and waits this old fucking prick out.

1158
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:23,160
On the morning of his 14th birthday,

1159
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:27,080
he walks into his old man 's room
with a baseball bat.

1160
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:33,280
Then he Mark McGwire's
the fucking living shit out of him.

1161
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:41,280
After that, the old man,
he can 't even hold a spoon without shaking.

1162
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:46,560
He don 't remember things too good either.

1163
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:48,600
He's neutralised.

1164
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:53,440
Which is a good thing.

1165
01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:57,040
Four more years max.

1166
01:20:57,120 --> 01:21:00,480
Maybe three if you get some size early on.
You just gotta hang in there.

1167
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:05,320
- (Faint conversation)
LESTER: It's more money.

1168
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:07,160
<i>It's lonely at the top</i>

1169
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:09,720
Running these corporations...

1170
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:13,080
Get your hands off Lester's property.
That's my property.

1171
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:15,280
WOMAN: "I'm sorry"

1172
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:17,600
JOEY: "You stay right there Don 't you move"

1173
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:20,760
Stay just like that.

1174
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:22,520
What the fuck?

1175
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:27,960
Jesus Christ, not now.

1176
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:32,280
Let's get in the cab.

1177
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:36,840
- I can hide it for you.
- No, give it to me!

1178
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:40,080
They're gonna think you got the.38
and frisk you.

1179
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:43,880
Come on. Give me the fucking gun.

1180
01:21:53,320 --> 01:21:56,400
Yo, Joe. What you got there?

1181
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:03,960
He's a Christmas elf.
I found him hitching a ride on Broad Street.

1182
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:05,840
(Chuckles)

1183
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:07,880
Joey's a funny fucking guy, huh?

1184
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:10,080
Let me take a guess, Joey.

1185
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:12,240
You were just about to call us.

1186
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:15,520
That's pretty good. You must have telepathy.

1187
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:17,160
I must.

1188
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:18,960
Give me your piece.

1189
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,680
Think I'm fucking around?

1190
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:25,640
How about that, huh?

1191
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:27,360
Cocked and ready to go.

1192
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:29,520
What are you, fucking nervous, tough guy?

1193
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:34,200
You're gonna follow us, Joey.

1194
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:37,240
<i>The kid'll ride with us</i>

1195
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:55,240
Stay the fuck in the car.

1196
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:03,680
(Cellphone rings)

1197
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:06,800
Yeah? Nah, nah, I'm with him right now.

1198
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:10,400
Are you 100 per cent?

1199
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:14,120
You're a fucking idiot.

1200
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:19,200
Nah, don 't worry about it.
I'm gonna take care of this motherfucker now.

1201
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:27,680
Come on, what the fuck?

1202
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:29,320
You're gonna fucking whack me?

1203
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:33,840
Come on, man! I told you.
You got any doubts, I'll tell you.

1204
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:37,080
Shut your mouth.
Shut your fucking mouth... now.

1205
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:39,800
You see, my old man.

1206
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:42,880
He says to me, "Nobody...

1207
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:45,440
knows n obody"

1208
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:48,120
Would you fucking put that piece of shit away?

1209
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:51,240
- I fucking told you on my fucking family's...
- Fucking family?

1210
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:53,680
When I leave here,
I'm gonna fuck Teresa in the ass.

1211
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:55,920
That's how much I give a fuck about your family.

1212
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,640
On my fucking family, it ain 't the fucking piece!

1213
01:23:58,720 --> 01:24:02,040
How fucking far do we go back?
How fucking long have we known each other?

1214
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:04,080
Come on, what the fuck?

1215
01:24:04,160 --> 01:24:06,440
- This is bullshit!
- Like I said...

1216
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:09,560
"Nobody knows nobody."

1217
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:13,080
You fucking take this...

1218
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:17,440
- Not in front of the fucking kid.
- What kid?

1219
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:20,400
Listen, you knock this fucking gun
out of my hand one more time,

1220
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:23,400
I'm gonna blow your fucking brains
all over this fucking place.

1221
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:26,920
And I'll fuck that kid up right in front of you!
You got that, nigger?

1222
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,600
Nopody knows nobody! You got that?

1223
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:37,080
Shit! What the fuck?

1224
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:39,120
(Tommy chuckles)

1225
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:40,640
Oh, shit.

1226
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:42,680
You see, Pop...

1227
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:45,520
reached out to a friend of ours
in the department.

1228
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:48,160
Had him pull the paper on Rydell's recent busts.

1229
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:52,760
Turns out our friend Sal here
was running his own little thing on the side.

1230
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:54,360
Hey, Sal!

1231
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:55,920
How's fucking business?

1232
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,080
Huh?

1233
01:24:57,840 --> 01:25:01,840
A few weeks back,
Sal gets bagged by Rydell and his partners.

1234
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:07,080
They let him walk as a situated informant.

1235
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:10,560
We just got confirmation ten minutes ago.

1236
01:25:10,640 --> 01:25:13,600
Hey, hey! Hey, hey! Get the fuck up.

1237
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:15,600
(Cellphone rings)
- Get the fuck up.

1238
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:17,960
Yeah.

1239
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:19,400
Yeah?

1240
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:21,240
Oh, he's alone?

1241
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:24,280
Go ahead. Give me the fucking number.

1242
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:34,360
Have a Mai Tai on me, guys.

1243
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:39,840
One Nike gym bag, 60 bucks.

1244
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,760
(Laughs)

1245
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:56,360
You motherfucking guinea, cocksucking...

1246
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:01,120
One Nokia cellphone... 100 bucks.

1247
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:03,160
(Cellphone rings)

1248
01:26:05,640 --> 01:26:08,240
You have just fucked yourselves!

1249
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:10,320
One ounce of Semtex...

1250
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:12,080
(Beeping)
- "500 bucks"

1251
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:17,960
Getting rid of a dirty cop... (Chuckles)

1252
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:21,120
...fucking priceless.

1253
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:26,320
Now... the jury's still out on you, pal.
So do me a favour.

1254
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:29,160
Get your ass in that car and follow me.
And hey! Hey!

1255
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:31,720
Don 't get lost.

1256
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:33,880
I'm not fucking gonna.

1257
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:14,440
(Players grunt violently)

1258
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:28,640
Come on down. Come on down.

1259
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:37,120
How you doing?

1260
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:43,880
So...

1261
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:46,400
You wanna see something really cool?

1262
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:47,840
Mm?

1263
01:27:53,320 --> 01:27:55,240
It's called Jet Ice.

1264
01:27:55,320 --> 01:27:57,360
Black light paint.

1265
01:27:57,440 --> 01:28:00,320
<i>You gotta do crazy shit like this to fill the seats</i>

1266
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:09,440
Now Oeg

1267
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:12,560
<i>this is very serious matter</i>

1268
01:28:13,320 --> 01:28:14,960
This man.

1269
01:28:15,680 --> 01:28:19,000
He give you the gun to shoot Anzor?

1270
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:20,600
ANZOR: "Bullshit"

1271
01:28:20,680 --> 01:28:23,480
He gave it to you! He told you to whack me!

1272
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:27,960
- Stop fucking protecting him!
- You shut the fuck up.

1273
01:28:29,080 --> 01:28:30,720
(Tommy laughs)

1274
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:33,160
O"leg You listen to me"

1275
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:34,760
Where did you get gun?

1276
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:38,680
At school. I found it in a locker.

1277
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:41,880
Don 't you fucking touch him! Don 't touch him!

1278
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:45,560
- "Touch him and I'll fucking kill you!"
- You shut the fuck up!

1279
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:48,440
- "Your turn is coming"
- Yeah? Well, fucking eat me!

1280
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:51,240
You fucking Vor cocksucking bitch, fuck you!

1281
01:28:52,240 --> 01:28:55,440
- What did you call me?
- You heard me. Fuck you, you fucking bitch.

1282
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:58,640
I'm impressed. You know Vors.

1283
01:29:00,720 --> 01:29:04,760
Vor v zakonye, the Brotherhood.

1284
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:06,800
If you were smart man,

1285
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:09,600
you would learn to fear this symbol.

1286
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:12,280
Fuck you and fuck your brotherhood Vors.

1287
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:14,840
Cos I don 't fucking answer to you. Fuck you!

1288
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:18,320
Gonna let him muscle me around?

1289
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:21,200
We're just trying to establish
some truth here, Joe.

1290
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:24,320
To be honest, I think the man 's
got some grounds for inquiry.

1291
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:27,880
That's fucking bullshit! I told you,
I didn 't give the kid the fucking piece!

1292
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:29,080
Come on, Frankie!

1293
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:32,920
Come on, what the fuck, Frankie?
I told you! I didn 't give him the fucking piece.

1294
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:36,080
Don 't let him hurt the kid, Anzor.
Don 't you fucking hurt the kid!

1295
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:39,720
You fuck! You fucking motherfuckers!

1296
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:42,360
I'm gonna fucking kill you! Oh, shit!

1297
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:48,000
(Groans) Fuck you, Tommy!

1298
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:50,600
Don 't you do this, Frankie.

1299
01:29:50,680 --> 01:29:52,120
Don 't you do it!

1300
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:55,200
- "Don 't you fucking let him do this!"

1301
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:57,240
I'm not fucking lying!

1302
01:29:57,720 --> 01:29:59,240
I'm not fucking lying!

1303
01:29:59,320 --> 01:30:00,840
Fuck!

<i>Jesus tell them what they wanna know!</i>

1305
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,920
Fuck, I told you I didn 't know anything, Frankie!

1306
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,080
Fuck!

1307
01:30:12,640 --> 01:30:14,200
A fucking human hockey puck.

1308
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:15,680
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

1309
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:18,960
TOMM Y: O"h you 're gonna kill me?"
<i>You 're gonna fucking kill me?</i>

1310
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:20,040
(Roars)

1311
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:23,400
- Give Anzor the gun. Kill the kid.
- "Frankie don 't let him do this!"

1312
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:29,520
JOEY: "I'm gonna fucking kill you!"

1313
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:32,640
(Tommy cackles)

1314
01:30:34,640 --> 01:30:36,000
JOEY: "Don 't let them do this"

1315
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:38,960
FRANKIE: "What do you want me to do?"
<i>You brought it on yourself</i>

1316
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:41,400
No, don 't!

1317
01:30:41,480 --> 01:30:43,600
Don 't do it! Don 't!

1318
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:45,240
I'll fucking talk!

1319
01:30:45,320 --> 01:30:48,040
I'll fucking tell you
whatever you wanna fucking hear!

1320
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:51,000
No, my friend!
First you will see that I am serious.

1321
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:53,960
Then afterwards, believe me, you will talk!

1322
01:30:54,040 --> 01:30:56,920
Oh, come on! Jesus Christ, I fucking told you!

1323
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:01,760
I fucking told you, I'll tell you whatever
you wanna hear, you fucking motherfucker.

1324
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:03,480
Finish it! Do it right this time.

1325
01:31:04,240 --> 01:31:08,240
No, Anzor! Anzor, look at me! Don 't fucking do it!

1326
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:09,400
Shut up!

1327
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:12,680
I said finish it.

1328
01:31:13,400 --> 01:31:14,560
He's not your blood!

1329

JOEY: "Don 't fucking do it!"

1330
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:19,320
If you do it, I swear to God
you better swallow a bullet!

1331
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:21,880
There's no way you'd be able
to live with yourself!

1332
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:24,160
Trust me, Anzor! Don 't do it!

1333
01:31:24,240 --> 01:31:26,240
Say something bad about the Duke.

1334
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:29,800
Let me hear you call him a faggot.

1335
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:31,080
Come on!

1336
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:36,040

What are you fucking doing?

1340
01:32:08,040 --> 01:32:10,000
<i>Pick up the fucking gun</i>

Pick it up and use it!

1347
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:34,840
Pick it up and do it.

1348
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:39,960
Pick it up and do it!

Fuck you, Frankie!

Twassh 't ssu ppossod to go down t hiss way!

1358

1359
01:33:30,200 --> 01:33:32,800
Vor, whatever the fuck you are!

1360
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:35,680
Fucking didn 't like it, did you, your nephew was...

1361
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:38,280
was cooking and dealing in the neighbourhood.

1362
01:33:38,360 --> 01:33:39,880
That's what he said.

1363
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:42,160
He said, "Oleg, send him a message!"

1364
01:33:42,240 --> 01:33:44,440
<i>Said "Let's use the kid"</i>

<i>Yugi</i>

1366
01:33:45,640 --> 01:33:49,880
Would I put our thing in jeopardy
for some two-bit fucking meth lab?

1367
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:52,160
Think about it, OK? That's number one.

1368
01:33:52,240 --> 01:33:53,680
Number two.

1369
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:57,760
I don 't even live in that fucking neighbourhood!
What do I care if it blows up?

1370
01:33:57,840 --> 01:33:59,400
The gun.

1371
01:34:00,440 --> 01:34:03,080
It was Tommy's! You fuck!

1372
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:08,800
Tommy! Tommy, don 't get involved
in a goddamn jock fight. It's all bullshit!

1373
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:10,880
He fucking put it in my right hand.

1374
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:15,200
A fucking snub nose.38, stainless steel.
It was Tommy's gun!

1375
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:19,200
You motherfucker.
I told you to get rid of that fucking piece.

1376
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:21,240
Yeah, well, not to my fucking recollection!

1377
01:34:21,320 --> 01:34:25,040
He said, "Interest the tweaker's kid in the piece."

1378
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:28,920
That's what he said.
"Interest the tweaker's kid in the piece."

1379
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:30,120
Ask the kid!

1380
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:33,080
Ask the kid.

1381
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:35,600
Mr Gazelle, he gave me the gun.

1382
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:41,400
He said I'd get to go to the game if...
if I shot Anzor.

1383
01:34:41,480 --> 01:34:43,240
It would make his friends happy.

1384
01:34:43,320 --> 01:34:45,320
I'm sorry, kid.

1385
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:48,360
OK. OK. Fuck this bullshit.

1386
01:34:49,080 --> 01:34:50,880
Fuck you, Joey, you fucking bastard!

1387

- You're dying, motherfucker!

1394
01:35:34,280 --> 01:35:36,480
Where's the fucking gun?

1395
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:04,080
Mr Gazelle!

1396
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:23,920

1397
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,960
Fuck you.

1401
01:37:11,080 --> 01:37:13,000
Get off him, you fuck!

1402
01:37:13,080 --> 01:37:16,400
Do you know you got my son killed,
you fucking scumbag?

1403
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:18,040
Oh, Frankie.

1404
01:37:18,120 --> 01:37:20,640
I'm glad it's you
cos there's something I've been...

1405
01:37:20,720 --> 01:37:22,720
I've really been meaning to get off my chest.

1406
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:26,600
You rat cocksucker! All of this fucking time!

1407
01:37:26,680 --> 01:37:28,440
Yeah, this whole fucking time!

1408
01:37:28,520 --> 01:37:30,520
This whole fucking time!

1409
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:34,320
But we don 't have your finger on the trigger,
so do me! It's one more nail in your coffin!

1410
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:36,480
Oh, you got all that, do you?

1411
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:39,640
How come it took you so long, then,
huh, tough guy? Huh?

1412
01:37:39,720 --> 01:37:42,040
How come? So fucking long! Tell me!

1413
01:37:42,120 --> 01:37:44,440
You had to climb into bed with Yugorsky,
didn 't you?

1414
01:37:44,520 --> 01:37:48,040
I was all but out and you had to go and mix it up
with the fucking Russians.

1415
01:37:48,120 --> 01:37:51,360
12 years undercover
and my own wife don 't even fucking know.

1416
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:53,840
Oh, you cocksucker. You don 't have to worry.

1417
01:37:55,120 --> 01:37:57,800
She ain 't never gonna hear it
from your fucking lips anyhow!

1418
01:37:57,880 --> 01:37:59,840
You fucking scumbag!

1419
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:04,320
I'll tell her all about it
while she sucks my fucking dick!

1420
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:06,280
(Gun clicks)

1421
01:38:10,600 --> 01:38:12,480
(Laughs softly)

1422
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:15,120
Come on. Come on!

1423
01:38:15,200 --> 01:38:17,400
<i>Are you fucking kidding me?</i>

1424
01:38:20,920 --> 01:38:22,800
<i>What are you gonna do with that little boy?</i>

1425
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:25,000
You know that I had a little boy? My Tommy.

1426
01:38:25,080 --> 01:38:27,480
<i>At one time he was your age</i>

1427
01:38:27,560 --> 01:38:30,480
What are you gonna do with that, kid?
What are you gonna do?

1428
01:38:30,560 --> 01:38:34,400
What are you gonna do with that,
you Cheerio-bred, little motherfucker!

1429
01:38:39,240 --> 01:38:40,200
(Gunshot)

1430
01:38:55,240 --> 01:38:57,200
Let's go home.

1431
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:03,480
(Pistol clinks on ice)

1432
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:19,800
(Helicopter whirring)

1433
01:39:22,720 --> 01:39:24,680
(Sirens)

1434
01:39:28,440 --> 01:39:30,400
(Police cock guns)

1435
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:32,000
COP: In position!

1436
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:34,520
All right. On the other side. Let's go!

1437
01:39:42,920 --> 01:39:45,080
Jesus Christ, Joey, we got shorted out.

1438
01:39:45,160 --> 01:39:46,640
We lost you back in Newark.

1439
01:39:46,720 --> 01:39:48,440
You were headed for Little Odessa.

1440
01:39:48,520 --> 01:39:50,360
Air support finally made your Mustang.

1441
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:53,320
I'm taking the kid home to his mom.

1442
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:56,200
Joey, where are you going?

1443
01:39:56,280 --> 01:39:58,400
You're hurt. We gotta get you to a hospital.

1444
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:02,160
I'm going home.

1445
01:40:15,040 --> 01:40:16,920
What are you thinking?

1446
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:18,800
I don 't wanna go home.

1447
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:23,000
Well, I'm next door to you, remember,
and I'm gonna be keeping my eye on you.

1448
01:40:29,680 --> 01:40:33,440
Why don 't we get breakfast before we have to
start making with the heavy explaining?

1449
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:35,680
Get ourselves cleaned up a bit.

1450
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:02,560
Hey, listen.

1451
01:41:02,640 --> 01:41:05,400
I'm taking Nick to the game on Friday night.

1452
01:41:06,520 --> 01:41:08,320
Maybe we could find another ticket.

1453
01:41:11,360 --> 01:41:13,680
If you would like to go, that is.

1454
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:27,520
All right, that's good.

1455
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:30,200
You want some more orange juice?

1456
01:41:38,080 --> 01:41:39,760
All right.

1457
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:42,960
Well, er...

1458
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:45,000
What do you say, we get out of here?

1459
01:41:58,040 --> 01:41:59,840
Well, lookie, lookie.

1460
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:02,200
If it ain 't little Charlie Bronson.

1461
01:42:04,440 --> 01:42:07,840
One thing about Lester.
He always makes good on a promise.

1462
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:09,200
Hey, asshole!

1463
01:42:11,360 --> 01:42:14,720
- (Groans)
WOMAN: What the fuck are you doing?

1464
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:17,600
- (Woman keeps shouting)
- You fucking piece of shit!

1465
01:42:17,680 --> 01:42:21,080
- You big fucking... (Groans)
- Cocksucker!

1466
01:42:21,160 --> 01:42:24,960
- (Shouting and grunting)
WOMAN: In your face, motherfucker!

1467
01:42:30,280 --> 01:42:32,360
Say hello to my little friend.

1468
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:36,800
That's real fucking original.
What are you? A fucking cartoon?

1469
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:39,760
I'm a Mac Daddy pimp. You know that.

1470
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:42,080
<i>And now I'm gonna cap your ass</i>

1471
01:42:42,160 --> 01:42:45,600
<i>When I'm finished with you</i>
<i>I'm gonna take your little punk friend</i>

1472
01:42:45,680 --> 01:42:48,040
and I'm gonna put him in my posse.

1473
01:42:48,120 --> 01:42:50,360
And I'm gonna pimp him out
for a couple of months!

1474
01:42:50,440 --> 01:42:53,720
And then I'm gonna take your knife
and cut him from ear to ear!

1475
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:56,120
Just like I should have done yesterday, you fuck!

1476
01:42:56,200 --> 01:42:58,760
I'm sure that sounds great to you
in your pimp world.

1477
01:42:58,840 --> 01:43:01,920
But, listen.
That's not the fucking thing you wanna do!

1478
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,760
You wanna put down that fucking gun
and walk away.

1479
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:08,360
Cos I swear to fucking God, I'll fucking kill you!
Stupid fucking pimp bitch!

1480
01:43:08,440 --> 01:43:09,760
Wrong!

1481
01:43:09,840 --> 01:43:12,760
Only one of us is walking out of here.
Guess who.

1482
01:43:12,840 --> 01:43:14,680
Oleg, get behind me.

1483
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:18,680
Oleg, get behind me!

1484
01:43:20,920 --> 01:43:23,480
(Chuckles)

1485
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:28,080
(Gunshot)

1486
01:43:38,520 --> 01:43:39,840
<i>Come on!</i>

1487
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:43,160
O"leg talk to me Come on! Talk to me!"

1488
01:43:43,240 --> 01:43:44,960
<i>You 're gonna make it</i>

1489
01:43:45,040 --> 01:43:47,240
<i>Joey please You 're bleeding</i>

1490
01:43:48,080 --> 01:43:49,720
Fuck, fuck!

1491
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:53,840
OLEG: Look out! Look out!

1492
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:13,280
Mr Gazelle! Stop the car.
We need to get some help.

1493
01:44:13,360 --> 01:44:14,560
Tee...

1494
01:44:14,640 --> 01:44:16,760
- "Please Mr Gazelle!"
- Tee... l'm coming home.

1495
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:19,800
(Speaks softly in Russian)

1496
01:44:20,840 --> 01:44:22,800

Mr Gazelle, please! Stop the car.
We need to get some help.

1499
01:44:36,040 --> 01:44:38,560
- I've gotta tell her.
- You're hurt!

1500
01:44:38,640 --> 01:44:40,720
<i>I'm gonna make it home</i>

Oh, my God.

1507
01:45:09,400 --> 01:45:10,840
- (Tyres screech)

1508
01:45:10,920 --> 01:45:14,080
Joey, please! Stop!

1509
01:45:14,160 --> 01:45:16,360

Nicky! Call 911!

1523

Don 't do this to me, Joe.

1524
01:45:56,320 --> 01:45:58,640
- Don 't fucking do this to me.
- Oh, sweetheart.

1525
01:45:58,720 --> 01:46:00,160
I loved you.

OK?

1527

Just remember.

1528
01:46:02,360 --> 01:46:03,880
I was always the real Joey.

1529
01:46:03,960 --> 01:46:05,680
OK? I wasn 't a liar.

1530
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:07,640
Shut up. Shut up. Look at me.

1531
01:46:07,720 --> 01:46:09,560
Look at me. Baby, look at me in the eye.

1532
01:46:09,640 --> 01:46:13,000
Joey, look at me in the eyes.
I don 't care, OK? It doesn 't matter.

1533
01:46:13,080 --> 01:46:15,120
I'm gonna kick your ass over it later.

1534
01:46:15,200 --> 01:46:16,800
Stay with me, Joey! Stay! Look at me!

- "They're on their way"
- OK.

1540
01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:29,840
We're still going to the game Friday, Dad?

1541
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:32,920
- I love you, Nick!
- It's OK.

1542
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,240
- He wants to go to the game, baby.
- Yeah.

1543

We're gonna go to the game.

- And fucking kick their asses, right, Mom?
- They are going down big fucking time!

1545
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:43,920
You have a bad mouth.

You have a... You have a bad mouth.

1547

- Joe?
(Siren wails)

1552
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:06,120
Joe?

1553
01:47:06,200 --> 01:47:07,920
Joe? Oh, God, no, no!

1554
01:47:11,480 --> 01:47:12,800
Oh, God, no!

1555
01:47:12,880 --> 01:47:15,160
Oh, God, Joe!

1556
01:47:21,560 --> 01:47:24,120
Get the kid outside!
I don 't want him going in there!

1557
01:48:16,120 --> 01:48:18,080
(Dog barking)

1558

Luis!

1559
01:48:22,520 --> 01:48:24,680
Hey, Luis.

1560
01:48:29,560 --> 01:48:31,280
Hey. George?

1561
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:33,880
- The alternator's in the car.
- All right.

1562
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:41,720
Don 't ever ask me to bury you again, Joe.

1563
01:48:59,200 --> 01:49:01,440
- What did they put in that coffin really?
- What?

1564
01:49:01,520 --> 01:49:03,680
- What did they put in the coffin?
- In the coffin?

1565
01:49:03,760 --> 01:49:05,600
- (Laughs) Yeah.
- Why? Did it seem heavy?

1566
01:49:05,680 --> 01:49:06,760
Yeah!

1567
01:49:06,840 --> 01:49:10,120
I don 't know.
I'm thinking, probably a couple of blue shirts.

1568
01:49:10,200 --> 01:49:12,920
Must have been Lashon and McCall.

1569
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
- Does that sound good?
- And Kaimen.

1570
01:49:15,080 --> 01:49:17,240
- You want some of this too?
- For sure, Marishka.

1571
01:49:17,320 --> 01:49:18,880
Marishka, you want some of this too?

1572
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:21,920
I'll take the both of you right now.
How about that?

1573
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,160
Razors. (Laughs)

1574
