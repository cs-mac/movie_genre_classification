1
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,592
Corn's up 3 cents. You sold
for less last week, didn't you?

2
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:42,971
We shouldn't be doing this,
it's not right.

3
00:03:43,131 --> 00:03:44,302
Not right?

4
00:03:44,465 --> 00:03:46,465
Let me remind you
what Dad always says:

5
00:03:46,634 --> 00:03:49,805
"When a man stops wanting,
a man stops living."

6
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:52,346
When your brother Grant
gets here next week,

7
00:03:52,514 --> 00:03:54,809
he'll be ABC'ing,
"always be closing."

8
00:03:55,893 --> 00:03:58,860
You know he used to keep his suit
in his gym locker

9
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,362
in case a funeral needed
a trumpet player?

10
00:04:01,522 --> 00:04:04,897
Actually I did know that because
we went to the same high school.

11
00:04:05,067 --> 00:04:07,943
You're too dark, son.
That's always been your problem.

12
00:04:08,111 --> 00:04:11,282
People like winners,
people with good attitudes.

13
00:04:15,452 --> 00:04:17,544
Okay, here we come.

14
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:28,425
Dean. These people are bereaved and
they need condolences from a family.

15
00:04:28,588 --> 00:04:31,885
Family is you and me.
I don't wanna be a part of this family.

16
00:04:32,051 --> 00:04:34,597
I'd love to talk about that
at some later date,

17
00:04:34,761 --> 00:04:36,477
but I want you to get out,

18
00:04:36,637 --> 00:04:40,104
we're gonna go over and you're
gonna shake this family's hand.

19
00:04:40,766 --> 00:04:41,982
Let's go.

20
00:04:55,612 --> 00:04:57,204
<i>On behalf of David's family,</i>

21
00:04:57,364 --> 00:05:00,206
<i>I'd like to thank you
for attending this service</i>

22
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:04,210
<i>of respect and dedication
for their beloved father and farmer.</i>

23
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:07,956
Death, in a number of ways,
unites us all,

24
00:05:08,124 --> 00:05:12,296
and David's demands that
each of us put aside our toil

25
00:05:12,462 --> 00:05:14,303
to unite ourselves in his honor.

26
00:05:14,464 --> 00:05:18,680
Today we share the bond of
love and friendship for David.

27
00:05:19,092 --> 00:05:24,638
The farmer, who depends directly
on rain and sunshine and climate,

28
00:05:24,805 --> 00:05:26,646
must be a person of faith.

29
00:05:26,808 --> 00:05:30,684
He has faith in the Creator
every time he plants a seed.

30
00:05:30,852 --> 00:05:33,478
Sorry for your loss.
Mr. Pritchard.

31
00:05:33,647 --> 00:05:35,067
Elizabeth.

32
00:05:35,232 --> 00:05:37,403
I'm Henry Whipple.
This is my son, Dean.

33
00:05:37,567 --> 00:05:39,238
Henry. Dean.
Thanks for coming.

34
00:05:39,403 --> 00:05:41,620
Dean and myself,
really our whole family,

35
00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:44,325
we wanna extend our
sympathies to your family.

36
00:05:44,491 --> 00:05:47,082
Did you know Dad?
Oh, surely I knew of him.

37
00:05:47,243 --> 00:05:49,664
We belonged to the same co-op.

38
00:05:49,829 --> 00:05:54,330
And I know your dad owned
200 acres that he rented out.

39
00:05:54,498 --> 00:05:55,749
What are you getting at?

40
00:05:55,917 --> 00:05:59,008
Seeing as how you live down
in the big city of St. Louis,

41
00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:02,340
it's gonna be a hassle
for you to oversee that property.

42
00:06:02,506 --> 00:06:04,802
And I just wanted to
let you know

43
00:06:04,967 --> 00:06:07,137
I'm prepared
to take it off your hands.

44
00:06:07,301 --> 00:06:09,518
Get out of here.
Don't decide now.

45
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,430
When the time is right,
you can talk it over...

46
00:06:12,598 --> 00:06:15,269
I said go away.
You're sick.

47
00:06:16,102 --> 00:06:21,024
All right. I know that you're in
grief, sir, but you do have my card.

48
00:06:23,025 --> 00:06:24,900
I'm sorry.

49
00:06:26,694 --> 00:06:29,285
What? Sharks.

50
00:06:29,447 --> 00:06:33,573
I've been renting and farming
Pritchard's land for 10 years.

51
00:06:33,743 --> 00:06:35,368
Stay away from it, hoss.

52
00:06:36,077 --> 00:06:37,702
Okay.

53
00:06:46,086 --> 00:06:49,586
Grant would've closed it. ABC, right?
That's not funny.

54
00:06:49,757 --> 00:06:52,849
That land was gonna be
his "welcome home" gift.

55
00:06:54,635 --> 00:06:57,852
Sir, I am so sorry...
I can't stand you kind of people.

56
00:06:58,014 --> 00:07:02,015
But Elizabeth can't deal with this and
I don't ever wanna come back to Iowa.

57
00:07:02,185 --> 00:07:05,651
Going price is 8000 an acre.
Where do we sign?

58
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:19,657
Oh. The cool kids have graced
us with their presence.

59
00:07:21,451 --> 00:07:23,951
Rolling out the "welcome
home" carpet for Grant.

60
00:07:24,119 --> 00:07:25,960
Are these enough cookies?

61
00:07:26,539 --> 00:07:28,880
No. More.

62
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:38,430
You again.
Why do you always eat standing up?

63
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:42,597
Because, Cadence,
who does time wait for?

64
00:07:43,888 --> 00:07:45,559
I don't know.

65
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:49,140
No man. Time waits for no man.

66
00:07:53,605 --> 00:07:56,446
Oh, no, no.
I wouldn't wanna trouble you.

67
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:02,827
Grant's gonna flip when
he sees the 200 acres I got him.

68
00:08:22,257 --> 00:08:25,507
He's finally coming home.
Yes, he is.

69
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:36,146
Expand or die, gentlemen.

70
00:08:36,311 --> 00:08:37,436
Get big,

71
00:08:38,271 --> 00:08:39,646
or get out.

72
00:08:39,813 --> 00:08:44,655
We all know this is what it takes
to make it in modern agriculture.

73
00:08:44,818 --> 00:08:46,864
Grain prices
are at an all-time high

74
00:08:47,028 --> 00:08:50,655
and traders are betting on corn
like it's the new gold.

75
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:54,574
<i>Corn alone is a 2 trillion-dollar
market, gentlemen,</i>

76
00:08:54,744 --> 00:08:59,085
and you, you are responsible
for that money.

77
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:02,623
I've got a PhD in microbiology
and I've been working closely

78
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:06,794
with farmers from your community,
like the Liberty Seed salesman

79
00:09:06,962 --> 00:09:08,554
Jim Johnson and Sons. Jim.

80
00:09:09,047 --> 00:09:11,264
Thanks very much.
Heh-heh-heh.

81
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:13,926
We've had a chance to
sit down and talk about

82
00:09:14,094 --> 00:09:19,391
how AgriWarrior can create
a nutrient explosion in your soil.

83
00:09:19,557 --> 00:09:23,603
If your soil is like most, you've got
an abundance of insoluble nutrients...

84
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:27,815
We should just rotate our crops
and avoid the effects of glyphosate.

85
00:09:27,982 --> 00:09:29,607
How'd you know that?

86
00:09:29,775 --> 00:09:31,696
I've been on the farm
my whole life.

87
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:36,201
Kind of picked a few things up.
He's right. Rotating never hurts.

88
00:09:36,363 --> 00:09:39,705
Hey, where are you going?
I'm going to the bathroom.

89
00:09:40,618 --> 00:09:44,369
Iron is up over 54 percent.
University tests...

90
00:09:44,579 --> 00:09:47,017
Bringing a whole
other tractor into the field.

91
00:09:47,124 --> 00:09:49,715
About gave us a heart attack,
but it was exciting.

92
00:09:49,918 --> 00:09:51,509
Hey.

93
00:09:52,128 --> 00:09:54,094
Don't these look like
bloody fingers?

94
00:09:54,255 --> 00:09:56,096
Sounds appetizing.
Let's go.

95
00:09:56,257 --> 00:09:59,757
Hi, Mr. Richardson. How are you?
Saw your race last weekend.

96
00:09:59,927 --> 00:10:03,644
That foot is made of lead.
It's gonna get you to NASCAR.

97
00:10:03,804 --> 00:10:04,804
Thank you.

98
00:10:04,972 --> 00:10:07,848
I said the same thing
to Chuck Young back in '88.

99
00:10:08,017 --> 00:10:10,608
Have I told you that story?
Yes, sir, you did.

100
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:13,611
Actually, we just gotta get going.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on, son.

101
00:10:13,772 --> 00:10:16,148
You and Chuck Young
are not the same.

102
00:10:16,316 --> 00:10:18,237
You use your head.

103
00:10:18,402 --> 00:10:22,119
And Chuck, I'm sorry to say,
wasn't long on brainpower.

104
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,951
Thank you very much. We gotta get going.
Thank you.

105
00:10:25,115 --> 00:10:27,411
Very nice sitting next to you.
Thank you.

106
00:10:27,576 --> 00:10:29,668
Dean, the whole town's
behind you.

107
00:10:29,828 --> 00:10:31,374
Thank you, sir.

108
00:10:31,579 --> 00:10:34,671
Oh, come on! I thought
it was just me and you tonight.

109
00:10:34,832 --> 00:10:36,832
Torgeson, we can
still hold hands.

110
00:10:37,001 --> 00:10:38,718
Fuck, no.

111
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,546
What's up, brother?
Let's do it.

112
00:10:55,309 --> 00:10:57,059
Dude, you're not listening to me.

113
00:10:57,227 --> 00:11:00,774
You are figure-eight point leader,
two years running.

114
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:05,315
Figure eight's amateur hour, dude.
I gotta move up to asphalt tracks, man.

115
00:11:05,484 --> 00:11:07,701
Asphalt is for getting
to the dirt tracks.

116
00:11:07,862 --> 00:11:10,237
ARCA's got that
big sponsorship money, man.

117
00:11:10,406 --> 00:11:11,782
That big money. Big money.

118
00:11:11,949 --> 00:11:15,667
You're gonna have to make some
big changes to make it to ARCA.

119
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:19,625
I'm doing ARCA.
It's the next step to NASCAR.

120
00:11:19,999 --> 00:11:21,795
You got your 9 mill in here?

121
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:23,755
Hell, yeah, man. All day.

122
00:11:24,377 --> 00:11:27,878
It's for the thugs.
It's a pretty little bitch, ain't it?

123
00:11:29,091 --> 00:11:31,932
- Drive to Rippey.
- Ain't nothing in Rippey

124
00:11:32,093 --> 00:11:35,264
but ditch water and herpes.
It's like two hours away.

125
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:38,430
What else were you gonna do
with two hours in Iowa?

126
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:40,144
Let's go.

127
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,237
I gotta ask you something.
I need a job.

128
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:50,149
Uh-oh. What about
your seed cleaning business?

129
00:11:50,318 --> 00:11:53,989
After 42 years,
I have to close my doors.

130
00:11:54,572 --> 00:11:57,788
Nobody uses natural seeds
anymore, look around.

131
00:11:57,949 --> 00:11:59,995
Ninety percent
are genetically modified.

132
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,831
Ninety-three percent
GMOs and rising.

133
00:12:02,995 --> 00:12:04,870
Yeah, well, whatever.

134
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,507
That place of yours, that's gotta
be worth at least 3 million.

135
00:12:08,667 --> 00:12:11,213
Well, that's tied up
in equipment mostly.

136
00:12:11,378 --> 00:12:14,345
And besides, what if
we have another dust bowl?

137
00:12:14,506 --> 00:12:18,097
That's a mighty disappointing
thing to say to a friend.

138
00:12:18,259 --> 00:12:21,601
Especially after the not-so-legal
job I did for you in the past.

139
00:12:21,763 --> 00:12:23,263
Hey. Whoa. Huh.

140
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,311
Will you keep your voice down?

141
00:12:29,686 --> 00:12:32,027
I paid you then, remember?

142
00:12:32,188 --> 00:12:35,906
I'm just reminding you,
that's all. That's all.

143
00:12:36,108 --> 00:12:38,450
Well, I don't like it.

144
00:12:39,444 --> 00:12:43,490
All I'm saying, begging.

145
00:12:43,656 --> 00:12:47,828
Is even one or two days a week
of honest work would help me.

146
00:12:47,994 --> 00:12:50,665
I'm sorry,
buddy, I can't give you a job.

147
00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:53,249
I hope it doesn't come between us.

148
00:12:56,001 --> 00:12:58,672
Congratulations on a fine talk.
Thanks very much.

149
00:12:58,837 --> 00:12:59,962
Henry Whipple.
Yeah.

150
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:02,971
You've heard of me. Number
one Liberty Seed salesman

151
00:13:03,133 --> 00:13:05,304
in seven counties
of southwestern Iowa,

152
00:13:05,467 --> 00:13:08,218
including Greene,
Union, Ringgold, Decatur...

153
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:10,229
Is that right? Ha-ha-ha.
Sure is. Ha, ha.

154
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:12,981
And I have a nice-sized farm
up in Churdan,

155
00:13:13,141 --> 00:13:14,982
family-owned for four generations.

156
00:13:15,143 --> 00:13:17,893
Three thousand seven hundred
acres, as of today.

157
00:13:18,062 --> 00:13:21,233
Now, if I could be personally
certain of your product,

158
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,492
give it the Whipple seal
of approval,

159
00:13:24,818 --> 00:13:28,160
maybe there's something
that I could do to help you.

160
00:13:28,322 --> 00:13:30,163
Are you asking for free samples?

161
00:13:30,323 --> 00:13:35,744
Sir, I never ask anything from a man
other than respect, trust and loyalty.

162
00:13:35,912 --> 00:13:39,584
Jim. Jim. Thank you so much
for letting me use your name.

163
00:13:39,748 --> 00:13:43,466
No. My pleasure. What you said about
glyphosate locking up nutrients

164
00:13:43,627 --> 00:13:45,843
like manganese and iron
struck a chord.

165
00:13:46,003 --> 00:13:48,470
We'll spread the word.
Count on it.

166
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:51,845
Henry.
Jim.

167
00:13:52,008 --> 00:13:54,429
Everything good?
Hunky-dory.

168
00:13:58,723 --> 00:14:00,519
I can see that you're all tied up.

169
00:14:00,684 --> 00:14:02,730
We'll talk later. Um...
Yes.

170
00:14:02,894 --> 00:14:05,861
Just remember,
I am number one in seven counties,

171
00:14:06,062 --> 00:14:08,188
including Boone, Garrison,
Decatur...

172
00:14:08,357 --> 00:14:10,733
Dad's got Decatur.
Brad.

173
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:14,994
What are you talking about?
Sorry, Henry.

174
00:14:15,155 --> 00:14:18,908
There's no apologies needed. I know
Brad's kidding about Decatur, right?

175
00:14:19,075 --> 00:14:21,292
No. Dad took it last week.

176
00:14:21,453 --> 00:14:24,203
We're number one
in 24 counties now.

177
00:14:24,371 --> 00:14:25,622
"Took" is a strong word.

178
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:28,836
- You know, if this is a bad time?
- No. Not at all, Roger.

179
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:33,048
Just a meeting of the minds, a couple of
Liberty men. That's all. Right, Henry?

180
00:14:33,212 --> 00:14:35,463
So, what customer did you take?

181
00:14:35,631 --> 00:14:38,052
Just some people.
Some people?

182
00:14:38,218 --> 00:14:41,593
Wanted to try a new tactic
on their farms, that's all.

183
00:14:41,762 --> 00:14:44,138
I'm sure they'll be back with you next year.
Oh.

184
00:14:44,307 --> 00:14:47,773
If you'll excuse me, I wanted
to introduce Roger to the boys here.

185
00:14:47,935 --> 00:14:50,811
My oldest, Brad. You met him.
Good to see you again.

186
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:54,026
- My goodness, it's been years.
- My second son, Brett.

187
00:14:54,191 --> 00:14:55,987
How are you? Pleasure.
Look at you.

188
00:15:02,947 --> 00:15:07,494
What the hell are you acting like some
cyborg assassin for all of a sudden?

189
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,206
I'm making some changes.

190
00:15:09,371 --> 00:15:13,167
Guns are for thugs, not farmers.

191
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:20,676
Oh!

192
00:15:21,714 --> 00:15:25,056
Fucking A! Jesus Christ!

193
00:15:25,219 --> 00:15:27,265
Crap! Whore!

194
00:15:27,428 --> 00:15:30,053
Whorey whore!

195
00:15:30,223 --> 00:15:34,474
Holy shit! A Vortech supercharger!
You're gonna fly with this thing!

196
00:15:34,644 --> 00:15:35,894
Oh, my God!

197
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:38,562
- You are insane!
- Oh, my God!

198
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:42,022
You are fucking insane!
Look. I got you an air freshener.

199
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,070
Let's go.

200
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:48,365
Ow! Hoo-hoo!

201
00:16:11,969 --> 00:16:14,810
You're weren't kidding
when you said you finish first.

202
00:16:14,972 --> 00:16:18,269
I should have gotten you
out of my system a long time ago.

203
00:16:32,945 --> 00:16:35,446
What am I gonna tell Dad?

204
00:16:35,613 --> 00:16:37,080
About what?

205
00:16:37,241 --> 00:16:39,582
About Decatur, the county.

206
00:16:39,742 --> 00:16:42,118
It's gone. Harvested away.

207
00:16:42,287 --> 00:16:47,413
Jim Johnson, that shark, he
passes half his sales commissions

208
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:50,959
under the table in cash
to bribe my customers.

209
00:16:51,588 --> 00:16:54,259
Sounds like the mafia.
Ugh.

210
00:16:59,176 --> 00:17:01,552
Dad gave me everything.

211
00:17:02,471 --> 00:17:06,222
Granddad before him.
I can't let them down.

212
00:17:50,473 --> 00:17:52,473
In here, somebody
who wants to see you.

213
00:17:52,642 --> 00:17:54,893
Hey, Dad.
George Naylor's here.

214
00:17:55,061 --> 00:17:57,278
Hey, Cliff. It's been a while.
Yeah.

215
00:17:57,437 --> 00:18:00,984
You know it's Customer Appreciation
Day and not the Fourth of July?

216
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:03,616
It's called marketing, Dad.

217
00:18:03,777 --> 00:18:07,653
And you're the first invitee, George.
End of summer. Be there.

218
00:18:07,821 --> 00:18:11,617
You lose any more counties, there
won't be any customers to appreciate.

219
00:18:11,784 --> 00:18:13,126
We got it covered.

220
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:41,979
What I'll do, I'm gonna load you
up with a tote of Liberty 780R seeds,

221
00:18:42,144 --> 00:18:43,269
see how that does.

222
00:18:43,437 --> 00:18:46,153
Knock-knock. I brought
barbecue sands and some pop.

223
00:18:46,314 --> 00:18:48,905
From Tater's?
You betcha. No time to make them.

224
00:18:49,317 --> 00:18:52,988
And I know you like extra bacon,
so I got an extra side for you.

225
00:18:53,153 --> 00:18:56,995
Now you're talking. Slaw in there?
Yeah. Slaw.

226
00:18:57,533 --> 00:18:59,283
There's that.

227
00:18:59,535 --> 00:19:01,035
Oh, yeah.

228
00:19:02,995 --> 00:19:04,246
What is it, honey?

229
00:19:06,874 --> 00:19:08,294
"Dear Morn and Dad:

230
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:12,300
Greetings from Mount Aconcagua
in the Andes, ahem,

231
00:19:12,463 --> 00:19:14,589
tallest mountain in South America.

232
00:19:14,756 --> 00:19:17,848
Guess what. I'm going to climb it.

233
00:19:18,052 --> 00:19:20,268
The people here are so friendly.

234
00:19:20,428 --> 00:19:25,180
Hope this postcard finds you in time.
Say hi to Dean. Love, Grant."

235
00:19:25,558 --> 00:19:28,775
It looks romantic.
That's a bunch of hogwash.

236
00:19:28,936 --> 00:19:32,153
That kid's so off the grid
he doesn't even bother to call.

237
00:19:32,313 --> 00:19:35,484
Henry, make yourself useful,
take me out of here.

238
00:19:35,942 --> 00:19:39,533
I think I gotta get going too.
Well, hold on there now, George.

239
00:19:39,695 --> 00:19:42,071
We haven't even had
a chance to talk turkey

240
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,161
or barbecue, as it were. Heh, heh. I
mean, am I losing a customer here?

241
00:19:46,326 --> 00:19:49,327
Of course not, Henry.
Then sit down, take a load off.

242
00:19:49,495 --> 00:19:54,213
Oh, cut the bull. First Decatur
and now Grant. You lost him, Henry.

243
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:56,250
You never should have let him go.

244
00:20:10,474 --> 00:20:11,599
Yo, yo, yo!

245
00:20:28,323 --> 00:20:31,994
Come on. Come here.
No. No, I can't drive.

246
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:33,876
Yes, you can. Yes, you can.
No.

247
00:20:35,789 --> 00:20:38,881
Aah!
There you go. Straighten out. Whoo!

248
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:50,549
I like the sound your car makes
with its new part.

249
00:20:50,718 --> 00:20:54,309
Don't point that at people.
It's dangerous.

250
00:21:18,535 --> 00:21:21,661
Promise not to do what you did
at the auto shop again.

251
00:21:22,496 --> 00:21:24,088
Yeah.

252
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:28,417
Okay.

253
00:21:31,546 --> 00:21:34,047
Because I kind of really
like you.

254
00:21:47,476 --> 00:21:49,817
Oh, congratulations.
You must be proud.

255
00:21:49,979 --> 00:21:52,275
Thanks. What for?

256
00:21:52,439 --> 00:21:54,985
Your son's a real-life hero.

257
00:21:56,652 --> 00:21:59,653
"Grant Whipple to climb
tallest mountain in Americas."

258
00:21:59,821 --> 00:22:01,913
Jeez.

259
00:22:02,073 --> 00:22:03,823
The whole county
already knows.

260
00:22:03,992 --> 00:22:06,789
Relax, Henry.
You're gonna sprain something.

261
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:10,833
Why are my own children
sabotaging me?

262
00:22:10,998 --> 00:22:14,750
Does Grant not care one iota
about the 200 acres I got him?

263
00:22:14,918 --> 00:22:17,794
And Dean?
Oh, he's a lost cause.

264
00:22:17,962 --> 00:22:21,133
Why does he consistently
disrespect me?

265
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:23,470
Every man wants something
to call his own.

266
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,594
What's wrong with the farm?

267
00:22:27,762 --> 00:22:30,512
That's yours.
No. It's the family's.

268
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:33,774
Same difference.
Maybe not to Dean.

269
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,728
Breathe out.

270
00:23:07,256 --> 00:23:08,551
Dean.

271
00:23:10,717 --> 00:23:12,888
Hey! Dean Whipple!

272
00:23:14,262 --> 00:23:17,103
Do you mind
taking that off for a minute?

273
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:24,186
Thank you.
So my eyes have been opened.

274
00:23:24,355 --> 00:23:26,481
You know what I saw
when I looked around?

275
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:30,277
Corn?
No. I saw you.

276
00:23:30,612 --> 00:23:34,737
I now know that every man
wants something to call his own.

277
00:23:34,907 --> 00:23:36,158
And with that in mind,

278
00:23:36,325 --> 00:23:40,201
I'm gonna give you the 200 acres
we got from the Pritchards.

279
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:42,916
It'll be your own stake
in the family farm.

280
00:23:43,081 --> 00:23:45,628
One of these days,
your kids'll farm that land.

281
00:23:45,792 --> 00:23:47,463
Thought you got that for Grant.

282
00:23:47,627 --> 00:23:50,628
Well, Grant is out getting
God knows what kind of STDs

283
00:23:50,797 --> 00:23:53,673
from Argentinean girls.
You're here.

284
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,306
I'm not staying here, Dad.
I'm racing cars.

285
00:23:59,637 --> 00:24:02,387
Racing cars is a great hobby.
You don't sponsor me.

286
00:24:02,555 --> 00:24:04,022
You sponsor Arthur Link.

287
00:24:04,182 --> 00:24:07,774
The Links have been buying
seeds from me for 1O years.

288
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:10,561
You can't make money racing.
You can make money.

289
00:24:10,729 --> 00:24:11,775
Racing ARCA.

290
00:24:13,732 --> 00:24:16,858
Nick Elliott's recruiter
is coming to my next race.

291
00:24:17,027 --> 00:24:19,868
What?
Nick Elliott's coming to see you?

292
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,701
Yeah. Me.

293
00:24:22,281 --> 00:24:24,327
When they hand out
that big check,

294
00:24:24,492 --> 00:24:27,993
guess whose name
is gonna be on it. Mine.

295
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:32,667
You won't make it in the big leagues.
Just take the land. It's in your blood.

296
00:24:32,833 --> 00:24:35,674
Sooner you understand, the better.
I can't hear you.

297
00:24:35,836 --> 00:24:38,712
Gotta get this grain
to the elevator before they close.

298
00:24:56,812 --> 00:25:01,314
Honey, I'm paying a visit
to the Decatur traitors.

299
00:25:01,484 --> 00:25:03,325
Oh, Henry.

300
00:25:04,446 --> 00:25:06,946
Why don't you ask Cadence
to join you?

301
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,911
Because she's a feral child.
She's a good kid and Dean likes her.

302
00:25:13,077 --> 00:25:15,953
Besides,
she could use a father figure.

303
00:25:19,332 --> 00:25:20,708
<i>Hm.</i>

304
00:25:27,923 --> 00:25:31,094
Do your parents care that
you lounge around here all day?

305
00:25:31,761 --> 00:25:33,352
Mom makes meth in Jefferson,

306
00:25:33,512 --> 00:25:36,729
my dad will be out
in 10 to 20. They're busy.

307
00:25:37,308 --> 00:25:39,024
Well, okay.

308
00:25:39,769 --> 00:25:42,440
Do you wanna come
sell seeds with me?

309
00:25:44,605 --> 00:25:48,151
Why don't you ask Dean?
I'm not asking Dean.

310
00:25:48,317 --> 00:25:52,568
I'm offering you an opportunity
to do something worthwhile.

311
00:25:53,362 --> 00:25:57,613
So put some clothes on, for God's
sakes, and I will see you in the car.

312
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:08,674
This business is teeming
with life lessons

313
00:26:08,835 --> 00:26:12,132
for the next generation of Iowa,
Cadence.

314
00:26:12,297 --> 00:26:15,843
First lesson, loyalty.

315
00:26:16,008 --> 00:26:18,054
I have customers
in the seed business

316
00:26:18,219 --> 00:26:21,311
been with me since Dad was in charge.
And you know why?

317
00:26:21,471 --> 00:26:23,393
Because they're loyal.

318
00:26:23,556 --> 00:26:25,602
And I listen.

319
00:26:26,976 --> 00:26:32,694
Listening is another
great life lesson, Cadence.

320
00:26:32,857 --> 00:26:35,404
I listen to what my customers
have to say

321
00:26:35,568 --> 00:26:39,068
and in the end,
we'll find a solution

322
00:26:39,239 --> 00:26:41,785
for their next planting season.

323
00:26:42,199 --> 00:26:44,450
And this paves the road to success.

324
00:26:44,618 --> 00:26:47,118
And who doesn't wanna
be successful?

325
00:26:47,287 --> 00:26:49,162
So you have three L's:

326
00:26:49,331 --> 00:26:54,423
Loyalty, listening, equals solution.

327
00:26:54,585 --> 00:26:56,256
It's the key to happiness.

328
00:26:57,295 --> 00:26:59,716
So, what am I supposed
to do today?

329
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,506
Your job is to sit back and learn.

330
00:27:03,343 --> 00:27:06,469
There's another L for you, see?

331
00:27:09,306 --> 00:27:11,352
Hey, have you had
your breakfast today?

332
00:27:11,517 --> 00:27:13,517
Most important meal of the day.

333
00:27:13,686 --> 00:27:15,857
Thanks, Henry.

334
00:27:20,608 --> 00:27:23,700
Is Kevin around?
Yup. He's out on the field.

335
00:27:23,861 --> 00:27:26,577
Because I wanted to talk to him
about his yields.

336
00:27:26,738 --> 00:27:29,363
You know, growing strong,
living long.

337
00:27:29,532 --> 00:27:32,158
Maybe, uh, talk about some
purchases for next season.

338
00:27:32,327 --> 00:27:35,044
That's not necessary.
I know it's not necessary,

339
00:27:35,203 --> 00:27:37,670
but it's just something
that I like to do.

340
00:27:37,875 --> 00:27:43,127
<i># I think I'll
make it Sooner or later #</i>

341
00:27:44,172 --> 00:27:48,889
<i># We all might make it
When I'm older ##"</i>

342
00:27:49,302 --> 00:27:52,723
I gotta break it to you, we're
going with Jim Johnson and Sons.

343
00:27:52,887 --> 00:27:57,638
Right, but I thought maybe
if I could just talk to Kevin in person...

344
00:27:57,808 --> 00:28:00,150
But he's out in the field.
Say hi to Irene.

345
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:03,982
And we read about Grant in the paper.
The mountain thing.

346
00:28:04,147 --> 00:28:07,114
The mountain thing, that boy
is a real adventure seeker.

347
00:28:07,275 --> 00:28:10,401
We're really proud of him.
So are we. Bye, now.

348
00:28:10,569 --> 00:28:12,570
You have a good day.

349
00:28:17,992 --> 00:28:20,493
You in the mood for a Butter-finger?

350
00:28:21,204 --> 00:28:22,920
Give me one.

351
00:28:24,123 --> 00:28:27,590
Well, I'm glad you're happy
because I wanted to come over here,

352
00:28:27,751 --> 00:28:29,797
I wanted to check in with you.

353
00:28:29,961 --> 00:28:33,087
It seems there's been
some sort of switcheroo

354
00:28:33,256 --> 00:28:34,757
over here in Decatur.

355
00:28:34,965 --> 00:28:37,557
Yeah. I switched.
People say you're losing it.

356
00:28:37,718 --> 00:28:41,184
Actually, Henry's bringing bad
news, didn't know how to break it.

357
00:28:41,347 --> 00:28:43,848
Oh, yeah?
Oh, yeah?

358
00:28:44,015 --> 00:28:47,562
You see, farms in this area have
had some switches in temperature

359
00:28:47,727 --> 00:28:51,023
and Henry wanted to walk
the fields with you to make sure

360
00:28:51,189 --> 00:28:53,189
everything was okay
with your crops.

361
00:28:53,357 --> 00:28:54,403
Who's this?

362
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:56,784
I'm his intern. Cadence Farrow.

363
00:28:56,945 --> 00:29:00,070
Jim Johnson and Sons aren't here
walking the crops with you?

364
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:02,740
Is that any way to treat
a customer?

365
00:29:03,449 --> 00:29:05,075
No, Cadence. It isn't.

366
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:07,960
Well, sister, around here
we don't walk the crops,

367
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:10,212
we ride them. Troy,

368
00:29:10,372 --> 00:29:12,247
get the mud hogs.

369
00:29:31,058 --> 00:29:34,401
You were good today, Cadence.

370
00:29:34,561 --> 00:29:36,312
Your job is like a game.

371
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,856
You know, I used to think like
that too when I was starting out.

372
00:29:41,609 --> 00:29:45,281
Oh, can you actually drop me off
at 3rd Street? I'm meeting Dean.

373
00:29:48,324 --> 00:29:52,620
I guess he's got a lot going on
right now with his racing.

374
00:29:58,584 --> 00:29:59,959
What?

375
00:30:00,334 --> 00:30:03,585
Aren't you gonna ask me
to help you save Decatur again?

376
00:30:03,754 --> 00:30:06,505
Well, I thought
you already signed up.

377
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,890
Hee-hoo.

378
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,151
Cyclones star quarterback
Henry Whipple

379
00:30:26,317 --> 00:30:29,318
up against head cheerleader
Meredith Crown.

380
00:30:29,486 --> 00:30:32,032
He takes the ball.
Looks left, he fakes right,

381
00:30:32,196 --> 00:30:35,618
and then he scores a touchdown
right up the middle. Ha-ha-ha.

382
00:30:35,783 --> 00:30:38,203
Stoli O. That's my favorite.
Mm.

383
00:30:38,368 --> 00:30:41,665
We need to go back in and celebrate
the demise of Jim Johnson.

384
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:43,580
I need two more customers

385
00:30:43,749 --> 00:30:45,749
and then Decatur will be mine.

386
00:30:45,917 --> 00:30:48,292
Oh, not so fast.
We have some negotiations.

387
00:30:48,461 --> 00:30:50,133
Oh, yeah, fast.
Heh, heh.

388
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,300
Let's get some ice.
Okay.

389
00:30:54,925 --> 00:30:58,017
<i>Wide Parisian
boulevards lead to famous landmarks.</i>

390
00:30:58,179 --> 00:31:00,145
<i>The Pantheon.</i>

391
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,931
<i>The Old Opera.</i>

392
00:31:02,098 --> 00:31:03,723
<i>And the Arc de Triomphe.</i>

393
00:31:03,892 --> 00:31:05,688
Evening, honey.

394
00:31:06,477 --> 00:31:10,478
Wouldn't it be nice to finally see Paris?
We could visit the wine vineyards.

395
00:31:10,647 --> 00:31:13,443
Maybe we should take a
vacation, just you and me.

396
00:31:13,608 --> 00:31:17,451
That would be nice.
We can't. Work calls.

397
00:31:18,863 --> 00:31:21,455
We could go during
the slow part of the season.

398
00:31:21,615 --> 00:31:23,707
Uh, something might happen.
It usually does.

399
00:31:23,867 --> 00:31:25,583
I'm going to bed.

400
00:31:27,871 --> 00:31:30,372
But you have time
to take off work for Meredith.

401
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:36,006
I know you've been
sleeping with her.

402
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,421
I don't know
who's been telling you what,

403
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:41,431
but that is an out-and-out lie.

404
00:31:41,592 --> 00:31:45,218
And it's probably by people
who are jealous of us.

405
00:31:45,804 --> 00:31:47,975
I love you, Henry.

406
00:31:49,057 --> 00:31:52,775
And you make me feel
like an idiot for it every day.

407
00:32:17,206 --> 00:32:18,832
<i># Come on #</i>

00:32:43,856 --> 00:32:45,652
Brian.

415
00:32:45,817 --> 00:32:48,318
- Donna, how are you?
- Fine, how are you?

416
00:32:48,485 --> 00:32:50,952
You got the whole family
out today?

417
00:32:51,113 --> 00:32:53,784
You having a good time?
What are you eating, a dog?

418
00:32:53,948 --> 00:32:56,949
We need you to come out
because it's that time of year:

419
00:32:57,119 --> 00:32:58,790
Customer Appreciation Day

420
00:32:58,952 --> 00:33:01,453
for being a great customer.
Bring the family.

421
00:33:01,622 --> 00:33:03,668
Yeah.
All our family will be there.

422
00:33:03,832 --> 00:33:06,299
- The more the merrier.
- It's good to see you.

423
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:11,256
- Thanks for being a great customer.
- Have fun. Root for number 25.

424
00:33:11,881 --> 00:33:14,598
Good luck, man, I'll see you out there.
Thank you.

425
00:33:16,051 --> 00:33:19,722
Sorry to bother you. Would you mind
getting a photo with my brother?

426
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:22,397
- No. Come here, buddy.
- He's a little shy.

427
00:33:22,558 --> 00:33:23,899
What's your name?
Keith.

428
00:33:24,058 --> 00:33:25,309
Keith, I'm Dean.
Hey.

429
00:33:25,477 --> 00:33:28,102
Really, he's like obsessed
with you.

430
00:33:28,354 --> 00:33:29,570
Um...

431
00:33:34,318 --> 00:33:37,410
Um... Got it.

432
00:33:37,571 --> 00:33:39,242
Thank you.
And good luck today.

433
00:33:39,406 --> 00:33:42,327
- Yeah. Nice to meet you, buddy.
- Come on, Keith.

434
00:33:45,161 --> 00:33:46,412
Henry.

435
00:33:46,579 --> 00:33:49,796
Oh, hi, Jim.
I got a surprise call this morning

436
00:33:49,957 --> 00:33:52,173
from Alex Murphy in Decatur.
Oh.

437
00:33:52,334 --> 00:33:55,426
Told me that he wanted to switch
back to buying the seeds from you.

438
00:33:55,587 --> 00:33:58,463
Well, "switch back"
is a strong word, Jim.

439
00:33:58,631 --> 00:34:02,598
He just wanted to try a little
different strategy in his fields.

440
00:34:03,928 --> 00:34:07,519
Have to get paperwork approved from
the manager for purchase switch.

441
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,647
Oh, worry not,
for approval I shall get.

442
00:34:10,808 --> 00:34:13,604
Now, if you'll pardon me, fine sir.

443
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,816
Have a good day.

444
00:34:16,313 --> 00:34:18,484
Dean, Kyle. Recruiter
for Elliott Racing.

445
00:34:18,649 --> 00:34:19,865
Thanks for coming, man.

446
00:34:20,025 --> 00:34:22,525
You're figure-eight champion,
two years running.

447
00:34:22,694 --> 00:34:26,161
If I like what I see today, we'll
give you one and only one shot.

448
00:34:26,323 --> 00:34:27,323
Interesting.

449
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:28,741
Race at the end of the month,

450
00:34:28,908 --> 00:34:30,783
and it'll cost you $15,000.

451
00:34:30,952 --> 00:34:32,577
- $15,000, huh?
- Oh, yeah, boy.

452
00:34:32,744 --> 00:34:34,585
I'm talking 10-person pit crew,

453
00:34:34,746 --> 00:34:36,712
trailers, tires, entrance fees

454
00:34:36,874 --> 00:34:39,250
and a whole mess of pussy.
Good luck.

455
00:34:39,418 --> 00:34:40,963
I'll be watching you.
Thanks.

456
00:34:41,127 --> 00:34:43,002
Come on, let's
grab some beers.

457
00:34:44,046 --> 00:34:47,047
You wanna indulge me as to
how you're gonna get $15,000?

458
00:34:47,216 --> 00:34:49,012
I got that saved in prize money.

459
00:34:49,176 --> 00:34:54,348
Dean, that is beer, beer and
abortion money, you know it.

460
00:34:54,515 --> 00:34:55,730
Sorry, Cadence.

461
00:34:55,890 --> 00:34:58,641
Ladies and
gentlemen, rise and remove your hats

462
00:34:58,809 --> 00:35:02,310
for the singing
of the national anthem.

463
00:35:02,646 --> 00:35:07,522
# O, say, can you see #

464
00:35:07,693 --> 00:35:11,819
# By the dawn's early light #

465
00:35:11,988 --> 00:35:16,581
# What so proudly we hailed #

466
00:35:16,742 --> 00:35:21,163
# At the twilight's last gleaming #

467
00:35:21,413 --> 00:35:26,164
# Whose broad stripes and bright stars #

468
00:35:26,334 --> 00:35:30,551
# Through the perilous fight #

469
00:35:30,714 --> 00:35:35,590
# O'er the ramparts we watched #

470
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:40,181
# Were so gallantly streaming #

471
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:43,974
# And the rocket's red glare #

472
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:49,228
# The bombs bursting in air #

473
00:35:49,396 --> 00:35:53,148
# Gave proof through the night #

474
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:58,618
# That our flag was still there #

475
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:04,774
# O, say does that
Star-spangled banner #

476
00:36:05,494 --> 00:36:07,460
# Yet wave #

477
00:36:08,623 --> 00:36:14,250
# O'er the land of the free #

478
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:20,414
<i># And the home of the brave #</i>

479
00:36:24,387 --> 00:36:26,183
Whoo!

480
00:36:29,016 --> 00:36:30,982
Let's get started.

481
00:36:31,143 --> 00:36:34,394
Let's give our drivers
a round of applause.

482
00:36:41,902 --> 00:36:44,994
Let's keep our eyes open for 25,
Dean Whipple, today.

483
00:36:45,155 --> 00:36:48,577
He's been dominating
on this track all season.

484
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:59,882
Whoa, whoa!
Jeez, Dean! This is insanity, Irene.

485
00:37:00,043 --> 00:37:02,590
Nobody would come watch
if there wasn't a crash.

486
00:37:04,506 --> 00:37:06,632
Brad Johnson, number 12,

487
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,801
pulls ahead of number 25.
They've had a rivalry all season.

488
00:37:12,764 --> 00:37:14,560
These boys are going
neck and neck.

489
00:37:19,812 --> 00:37:20,937
Ooh! That's a rough one!

490
00:37:21,105 --> 00:37:24,526
Did you see that? Did you see that?
I saw it.

491
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:25,690
The kid's a driver.

492
00:37:25,858 --> 00:37:28,904
I know.
He really is a driver.

493
00:37:30,987 --> 00:37:35,113
Brad Johnson is pulling up.
That's no love tap!

494
00:37:39,453 --> 00:37:41,329
Brad Johnson gets an inside line.

495
00:37:41,497 --> 00:37:44,374
You're going down, you fucking shit!
Hey, fuck you!

496
00:37:51,588 --> 00:37:54,260
Number 12 takes a
tumble as Whipple pulls ahead.

497
00:37:54,758 --> 00:37:57,509
Hope that Johnson boy
is all right in there.

498
00:37:58,137 --> 00:38:03,059
Ha-ha-ha. Did you see that?
What a move! Ha, ha!

499
00:38:03,683 --> 00:38:07,684
Dean Whipple straightens
out and sails through the final lap.

500
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:13,401
It's no surprise here, fans.
The winner is Dean Whipple!

501
00:38:13,775 --> 00:38:15,572
It's official.

502
00:38:18,779 --> 00:38:21,030
Yeah!
Number one, baby!

503
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:24,666
Brad's up and walking. It
doesn't look like he's a happy camper.

504
00:38:24,828 --> 00:38:26,294
Where is that motherfucker?

505
00:38:26,454 --> 00:38:29,671
Hey, what the fuck, man?
Look at that shit!

506
00:38:29,832 --> 00:38:32,332
Go flip your car over.
Unjust shit you pulled!

507
00:38:32,501 --> 00:38:35,092
The fuck's your problem?
Fuck's your problem?

508
00:38:35,253 --> 00:38:37,879
What the fuck?
You piece of shit.

509
00:38:38,089 --> 00:38:39,886
Fuck you!

510
00:38:44,262 --> 00:38:46,638
Get him, Dean! Come on.
Hey, hey, hey.

511
00:38:50,309 --> 00:38:53,276
Fucking asshole, fuck
you, you piece of shit!

512
00:38:53,687 --> 00:38:56,733
- The Whipples are a bunch of pussies!
- Fuck you!

513
00:38:56,899 --> 00:38:59,274
Come on. Come on, man.

514
00:38:59,443 --> 00:39:01,569
Piece of shit. It's my track!

515
00:39:01,736 --> 00:39:05,612
We know who won. We know
who won. We know who won.

516
00:39:05,782 --> 00:39:08,033
<i>- Number one!
- Dean, Dean!</i>

517
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,791
<i>Dean, Dean, Dean!
Yeah!</i>

518
00:39:10,994 --> 00:39:12,915
All right!

519
00:39:13,663 --> 00:39:16,459
Number one, baby!
Number one!

520
00:39:16,625 --> 00:39:20,217
Congratulations, Dean Whipple!

521
00:39:20,419 --> 00:39:23,011
Thank you, I appreciate that.
Ride with us.

522
00:39:23,172 --> 00:39:24,968
I want to, man,
count me in.

523
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:28,553
- Garage sale, some great finds.
- I can try, man.

524
00:39:28,718 --> 00:39:30,969
My sister was your
high school teacher.

525
00:39:31,137 --> 00:39:33,433
Was she? Yeah, I remember.
Thank you, ma'am.

526
00:39:33,598 --> 00:39:35,644
That was impressive
on the track today.

527
00:39:35,808 --> 00:39:37,979
Henry Whipple's son?
Don't remind me.

528
00:39:38,143 --> 00:39:40,643
I'm Meredith.
And I'm his girlfriend.

529
00:39:40,812 --> 00:39:43,529
Hi. We're gonna meet people
at Slipper's for drinks.

530
00:39:43,689 --> 00:39:46,031
Do you wanna join us?
Oh, how old are you?

531
00:39:46,193 --> 00:39:49,114
Actually, don't tell me.
I don't wanna feel old.

532
00:39:50,238 --> 00:39:53,409
You wouldn't wanna leave
your girl alone on this big night.

533
00:39:53,782 --> 00:39:55,704
All right.
Another time.

534
00:39:55,867 --> 00:39:57,459
Come on.

535
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:59,040
Good night.

536
00:40:02,373 --> 00:40:04,294
She was pretty.

537
00:40:04,626 --> 00:40:06,592
I didn't notice.

538
00:40:06,752 --> 00:40:08,093
There he is.
Yep.

539
00:40:08,254 --> 00:40:09,505
Hey.

540
00:40:09,672 --> 00:40:14,173
Dean. Hey, Dean, that was amazing.
Just amazing! Wow!

541
00:40:14,342 --> 00:40:17,013
Ah, it's no big deal.
Ha, ha. No big deal?

542
00:40:17,178 --> 00:40:20,349
Hey, get changed and
let's all go out and celebrate.

543
00:40:20,515 --> 00:40:22,231
Oh, thanks. I got plans.

544
00:40:22,391 --> 00:40:26,267
Well, break them.
Heck, this is important.

545
00:40:26,435 --> 00:40:27,856
Dad, I can't.

546
00:40:28,021 --> 00:40:31,067
I get these every weekend.
Here, you can have this one.

547
00:40:31,733 --> 00:40:33,950
Bye, Mom.
Bye. Good job.

548
00:40:34,111 --> 00:40:35,452
Hey, Dean.

549
00:40:38,446 --> 00:40:40,742
I was proud of you out there.

550
00:40:42,325 --> 00:40:43,826
Thanks, Dad.

551
00:40:43,994 --> 00:40:46,915
Whoo! Going to ARCA, baby!
Ha-ha-ha.

552
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,830
Come on, Henry.

553
00:40:48,998 --> 00:40:51,294
Dean, congratulations.

554
00:40:51,458 --> 00:40:53,379
Look at that.

555
00:40:53,585 --> 00:40:55,756
Dean, hey, here, here.

556
00:40:57,214 --> 00:40:58,509
Cheers, fellas.
Cheers.

557
00:42:05,568 --> 00:42:10,569
Would you ever cheat on your wife?
No. No, ma'am.

558
00:42:11,822 --> 00:42:14,572
I don't think
I'm glamorous enough for Dean.

559
00:42:16,494 --> 00:42:20,245
Sometimes guys get distracted
by girls with big...

560
00:42:20,413 --> 00:42:23,880
Racks?
Personalities.

561
00:42:24,043 --> 00:42:25,839
Jeez.

562
00:42:26,628 --> 00:42:28,879
Do you think
that's what Dean wants?

563
00:42:29,631 --> 00:42:31,927
No. That car...

564
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:35,134
it was behind us last time.

565
00:42:56,446 --> 00:42:57,571
Good afternoon.

566
00:42:57,738 --> 00:43:01,365
I couldn't help notice that you fine
gentlemen have been tailing me.

567
00:43:01,534 --> 00:43:05,251
Henry Whipple?
That's me. Don't wear it out. Ha-ha-ha.

568
00:43:05,412 --> 00:43:07,083
By purchasing Liberty seeds,

569
00:43:07,247 --> 00:43:11,089
you signed an agreement that gives
us the right to inspect your crops.

570
00:43:11,251 --> 00:43:13,922
What's this all about?
Let's cut to the chase.

571
00:43:14,086 --> 00:43:17,053
We've been investigating you
on their behalf.

572
00:43:17,549 --> 00:43:19,345
What?
And we got a tip

573
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:22,596
that you've been cleaning
and reusing their seeds.

574
00:43:22,761 --> 00:43:24,477
Well, who gave you this tip?

575
00:43:24,638 --> 00:43:26,855
We need to visit your fields,
take samples.

576
00:43:27,015 --> 00:43:28,357
When would be a good time?

577
00:43:29,767 --> 00:43:31,438
No time's a good time.

578
00:43:31,602 --> 00:43:35,944
You gave up that right, Mr. Whipple.
Now, when would be a good time?

579
00:43:38,567 --> 00:43:40,067
Um...

580
00:43:43,071 --> 00:43:44,742
Saturday?

581
00:43:44,948 --> 00:43:46,163
Saturday it is.

582
00:43:46,323 --> 00:43:48,369
You make sure you're there.

583
00:44:05,466 --> 00:44:08,467
Didn't know Publishers Clearing
House wanted to find you.

584
00:44:08,635 --> 00:44:11,476
How much did you win?
Not now, Cadence.

585
00:44:12,013 --> 00:44:13,809
What is it?

586
00:44:17,602 --> 00:44:20,399
Here's another life
lesson for you.

587
00:44:20,812 --> 00:44:26,234
Farmers used to save and clean
natural seeds after each harvest

588
00:44:26,401 --> 00:44:30,152
and then they'd plant them
again the next season.

589
00:44:30,322 --> 00:44:32,038
So?

590
00:44:32,198 --> 00:44:37,824
Well, uh, it's illegal to do that with
genetically-modified seeds like Liberty.

591
00:44:37,994 --> 00:44:40,835
You have to buy
new seeds each year.

592
00:44:40,997 --> 00:44:42,589
Why?

593
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:46,966
Because companies like Liberty
pay scientists big money

594
00:44:47,128 --> 00:44:49,676
to develop these GMOs

595
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:53,965
to make them stronger
so they'll produce bigger yields,

596
00:44:54,135 --> 00:44:56,431
and Liberty
has patented these seeds.

597
00:44:57,721 --> 00:45:00,722
So kind of like
bootlegging DVDs?

598
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:05,016
Yes. But there's a lot more money
at stake here.

599
00:45:05,604 --> 00:45:09,776
These guys didn't just copyright
movies, they copyrighted life.

600
00:45:15,530 --> 00:45:18,031
And you reused Liberty seeds,
didn't you?

601
00:45:39,717 --> 00:45:41,342
- Hey, Janet.
- Hey, Henry.

602
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:43,556
Byron around?
He's over there.

603
00:45:50,601 --> 00:45:54,319
If they find out,
I'll lose everything.

604
00:45:54,479 --> 00:45:59,605
You said you had two ways to go:
Stay the same or get bigger.

605
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:03,866
You needed cash
to buy more land,

606
00:46:04,613 --> 00:46:08,205
and reselling GMO seeds
was your only option.

607
00:46:09,952 --> 00:46:15,124
You didn't talk, did you?
Of course not. I'm in this with you.

608
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,592
Byron.

609
00:46:18,877 --> 00:46:22,923
I cleaned natural seeds
for your father on this machine

610
00:46:23,089 --> 00:46:26,260
that I built with my own hands.

611
00:46:26,885 --> 00:46:30,011
I was at your high school
football games, Henry.

612
00:46:30,179 --> 00:46:32,271
And your sons' too.

613
00:46:32,431 --> 00:46:34,272
I know.

614
00:46:35,350 --> 00:46:38,100
I'm sorry. I just...

615
00:46:40,229 --> 00:46:42,525
Who could have done this?

616
00:46:50,948 --> 00:46:54,369
You didn't reuse seeds
in your own fields, did you?

617
00:46:56,036 --> 00:46:58,081
Do I look like a fool?

618
00:46:58,244 --> 00:47:01,745
And the agents are only
checking your fields, right?

619
00:47:02,333 --> 00:47:03,879
Right.

620
00:47:05,168 --> 00:47:08,465
So they won't find
anything there.

621
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:10,630
You'll be fine.

622
00:47:10,798 --> 00:47:13,639
It'll blow over
like most storms.

623
00:47:15,094 --> 00:47:17,514
Yeah. Come on.

624
00:47:52,752 --> 00:47:55,504
What's this?
It's for you.

625
00:48:01,928 --> 00:48:06,725
Fifteen thousand dollars to
Nick Elliott Racing? Mom, no.

626
00:48:06,890 --> 00:48:09,141
From my account,
Dad doesn't have to know.

627
00:48:09,309 --> 00:48:12,776
Mom, what are you doing?
It'll be our secret.

628
00:48:13,313 --> 00:48:15,734
Fifteen thousand dollars.
Ha-ha-ha.

629
00:48:15,898 --> 00:48:18,399
Thanks, Morn.
Thank you.

630
00:48:57,894 --> 00:48:59,735
Set it up right.

631
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:18,331
This track is seven-eighths of a mile,
the compound banking makes it fast.

632
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:22,043
Now, that's the safety barrier,
but I promise you it's gonna hurt

633
00:49:22,207 --> 00:49:25,924
when you hit that 180 miles an hour.
So keep it straight, all right?

634
00:49:26,086 --> 00:49:28,257
Pay attention to your pit boards.
Right.

635
00:49:28,422 --> 00:49:30,138
Look for me
on warm-up laps,

636
00:49:30,298 --> 00:49:32,424
hit your mark every stop.
I'm serious.

637
00:49:32,593 --> 00:49:35,059
Screw up in the pits,
kiss your chance goodbye.

638
00:49:35,219 --> 00:49:37,185
This ain't no
figure-eight race, boy.

639
00:49:41,475 --> 00:49:44,941
Okay. That finishes that.
What did you get from that side?

640
00:49:45,103 --> 00:49:47,024
- Twelve.
- Twelve. From this side?

641
00:49:47,188 --> 00:49:49,530
- Eight.
- Enough? Are those the last'?

642
00:49:49,691 --> 00:49:53,032
- Yeah, should be.
- Are you done over there?

643
00:49:53,193 --> 00:49:57,365
That's it. Let's go. Wrap it up,
we're done. You two, let's go.

644
00:49:57,698 --> 00:49:59,494
Oh, and, uh, Mr. Whipple?

645
00:50:00,032 --> 00:50:01,874
- Yeah.
- There's one other thing.

646
00:50:02,034 --> 00:50:04,330
We broadened this case
to the possibility

647
00:50:04,495 --> 00:50:08,246
of you reselling Liberty seeds.
We need to access your invoices

648
00:50:08,416 --> 00:50:11,838
for the past three years.
Okay.

649
00:50:12,503 --> 00:50:15,629
My wife does the books.
You're gonna have to give us time

650
00:50:15,797 --> 00:50:19,388
to get that together. How about...?
Next week.

651
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:21,721
Oh, and good luck to your son.

652
00:50:22,053 --> 00:50:24,303
I understand he's quite
the driver.

653
00:50:27,516 --> 00:50:29,188
Starting in the 26th position

654
00:50:29,684 --> 00:50:32,605
in the black number 11
for Fast-Track Racing,

655
00:50:32,770 --> 00:50:36,862
from southern Iowa,
Dean Whipple!

656
00:50:38,692 --> 00:50:40,818
Have a good race.
Thank you.

657
00:50:44,531 --> 00:50:46,873
Thank you.
Thanks for driving with us.

658
00:50:47,033 --> 00:50:48,329
Thank you, sir.

659
00:51:26,611 --> 00:51:28,407
Let's go, son!
Go, Dean!

660
00:51:36,494 --> 00:51:39,210
Oh, hey. There he is.
Hey.

661
00:51:39,456 --> 00:51:41,127
Hey!

662
00:51:42,876 --> 00:51:44,296
Hee-hoo.

663
00:51:45,545 --> 00:51:48,012
Go get him.
You can do it, son.

664
00:52:06,563 --> 00:52:08,905
Gentlemen, start your engines!

665
00:52:22,410 --> 00:52:26,582
<i>Whoa'. Come on'. Get 'n, sow.
Ha-ha-ha.</i>

666
00:52:32,921 --> 00:52:34,717
Look at him!

667
00:52:35,756 --> 00:52:37,597
Go, son! Whoo!

668
00:52:37,757 --> 00:52:39,258
You can do it. Come on.

669
00:52:39,426 --> 00:52:42,472
All right, you're looking good, kid.
Just hit your marks.

670
00:52:59,944 --> 00:53:02,616
Dean! Push him out of the way.
Come on.

671
00:53:13,623 --> 00:53:16,373
<i>- What's up with this guy?
- Goddamn it, kid, focus!</i>

672
00:53:16,543 --> 00:53:20,385
You knock the fender off that thing,
you're gonna have a bad day.

673
00:53:21,171 --> 00:53:22,387
What the fuck, man?

674
00:53:22,548 --> 00:53:25,594
Did you see that? Did you see that?

675
00:53:32,056 --> 00:53:33,601
Come on, man! Come on!

676
00:53:39,897 --> 00:53:41,397
You gotta pick it up. Now!

677
00:54:13,218 --> 00:54:15,059
Goddamn you, kid!

678
00:54:45,122 --> 00:54:46,997
Hey, son.

679
00:54:47,165 --> 00:54:48,586
Hey.

680
00:54:48,876 --> 00:54:51,001
You should be proud.
You ran a good race.

681
00:54:51,169 --> 00:54:52,841
Don't say that.
Held your own.

682
00:54:53,004 --> 00:54:54,596
I'll get on the phone...
Dad!

683
00:54:54,797 --> 00:54:58,889
What are you trying to do? Come back
into my life now because I lose?

684
00:54:59,843 --> 00:55:03,014
I put myself in those cars
so I don't have to talk to you.

685
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:06,022
Grant's lucky. He left because
he couldn't stand you.

686
00:55:06,182 --> 00:55:09,809
Shut up, shut up. Not true.
Why do you think he's on a mountain?

687
00:55:09,977 --> 00:55:12,193
And never calls?
Dean.

688
00:55:17,610 --> 00:55:19,235
Forget it.
Yeah. Forget it.

689
00:55:19,402 --> 00:55:21,368
It's not worth it.

690
00:55:24,824 --> 00:55:26,870
Don't you have your own family?

691
00:55:34,792 --> 00:55:37,793
Hey, fuck it, man. Right?

692
00:55:38,211 --> 00:55:40,007
Let's kick rocks.

693
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:47,429
Irene. How long
were you gonna wait

694
00:55:47,843 --> 00:55:51,014
before you told me
about the $15,000?

695
00:55:52,807 --> 00:55:56,354
Cadence, this is addressed to Dean.
Will you run and give it to him?

696
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:58,110
Not sure he wants
any company.

697
00:55:58,270 --> 00:56:01,362
I'm sure he does.
He's out at the second farm.

698
00:56:04,025 --> 00:56:07,901
My son has always wanted to be a race
car driver and that was my money.

699
00:56:08,070 --> 00:56:10,741
That was family money.
No, it's mine.

700
00:56:10,906 --> 00:56:14,453
From my personal account,
so I used it for him.

701
00:56:20,290 --> 00:56:23,461
Why can't you be happy with
what's right in front of you?

702
00:56:48,566 --> 00:56:50,658
Need a hand?
No, kid.

703
00:56:50,817 --> 00:56:53,613
I gotta do this myself.

704
00:56:55,404 --> 00:56:58,030
All right, well, urn,
see you later.

705
00:56:58,199 --> 00:57:00,244
See you later.

706
00:57:26,683 --> 00:57:27,854
Aw.

707
00:58:51,342 --> 00:58:54,512
Oh, my God. Ha-ha-ha.

708
00:58:56,097 --> 00:58:58,314
I lost my shoe.

709
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,750
<i>Hi, Dean, from base camp.
Headed for the summit.</i>

710
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:20,511
<i>Freezing winds and tons of snow.
Wish me luck.</i>

711
01:00:20,672 --> 01:00:22,547
<i>Hope you're tearing up the tracks.</i>

712
01:00:22,716 --> 01:00:25,308
<i>We'll race for beers at Archie's
when I get back.</i>

713
01:00:25,468 --> 01:00:26,810
<i>Love you.</i>

714
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:28,936
<i>Grant.</i>

715
01:01:58,427 --> 01:02:02,428
Cadence brought these flowers.
Don't they look pretty?

716
01:02:02,596 --> 01:02:04,813
Can you ask her
not to come anymore?

717
01:02:06,017 --> 01:02:07,437
You're just tired.

718
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:10,192
I'm not tired, I'm thinking.

719
01:02:14,315 --> 01:02:16,281
You need anything?

720
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:34,206
You wanna explain to me
what's going on?

721
01:02:34,708 --> 01:02:36,879
I don't know
where I went wrong with Dean.

722
01:02:37,044 --> 01:02:41,170
No, no, no, not Dean. Dean's a kid.
He'll bounce back.

723
01:02:41,339 --> 01:02:43,305
I'm talking about the farm.

724
01:02:44,759 --> 01:02:46,431
What about it?

725
01:02:46,595 --> 01:02:50,141
I don't know what shit you're
trodding through with these agents,

726
01:02:50,306 --> 01:02:55,148
but you better get out of it.
Don't you lose what my daddy started.

727
01:02:55,310 --> 01:02:59,061
Dad, do you remember
when we had chickens and cattle?

728
01:02:59,230 --> 01:03:01,572
No.
Oh, come on.

729
01:03:01,733 --> 01:03:03,949
During the harvest,
kids would come over

730
01:03:04,109 --> 01:03:07,531
and we'd bale hay on wagons.
Yes. Of course I remember.

731
01:03:07,696 --> 01:03:10,868
I remember it was backbreaking work.

732
01:03:11,033 --> 01:03:13,500
Things like this
wouldn't happen back then.

733
01:03:14,703 --> 01:03:17,795
Those times, they were so simple.

734
01:03:17,956 --> 01:03:20,126
Let me tell you what simple is.

735
01:03:20,291 --> 01:03:23,042
It's a 48 row planter,
with air conditioning

736
01:03:23,211 --> 01:03:25,507
that drives itself with GPS.

737
01:03:25,671 --> 01:03:28,888
Oh, yeah, things are better now.

738
01:03:29,050 --> 01:03:33,051
And how you got into this mess
is beyond me.

739
01:03:33,221 --> 01:03:37,097
You better get off your ass
and make things right.

740
01:03:37,265 --> 01:03:39,560
Do you hear me?

741
01:03:41,937 --> 01:03:43,733
Yes, sir.

742
01:05:15,686 --> 01:05:19,812
Welcome home, son. Found this baby
parked in the driveway this morning.

743
01:05:19,982 --> 01:05:21,357
It's got your name on it.

744
01:05:22,108 --> 01:05:24,325
The Dean Whipple
red mean machine.

745
01:05:26,403 --> 01:05:30,449
Torgeson helped me find this thing.
It's got a 421 Chevy engine in it.

746
01:05:30,616 --> 01:05:32,787
It's got a 350 turbo transmission.

747
01:05:32,951 --> 01:05:34,951
It's got a Ford 9-inch
rear-end

748
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:38,791
and a whole bunch of other stuff I
don't even know anything about.

749
01:05:39,374 --> 01:05:41,794
What do you think? You like it?

750
01:05:43,252 --> 01:05:44,923
Thanks, Dad.

751
01:05:46,422 --> 01:05:48,514
Could you take it back?
Take it back?

752
01:05:48,672 --> 01:05:51,549
I thought that you and I
could work on this together.

753
01:05:51,968 --> 01:05:53,469
No, I'm not racing anymore.

754
01:05:54,845 --> 01:05:58,472
When you fall off a horse,
the best thing you do is get back on it.

755
01:05:58,682 --> 01:06:01,273
Look, I politely asked you,
please take it back.

756
01:06:20,286 --> 01:06:23,457
Hey.

757
01:06:24,498 --> 01:06:26,294
Thanks, Morn.

758
01:06:26,458 --> 01:06:28,584
You need anything else?

759
01:06:29,043 --> 01:06:30,589
No, I'm good.

760
01:06:31,504 --> 01:06:33,630
Those the guys
Granddad talked about?

761
01:06:33,799 --> 01:06:34,845
I don't know.

762
01:06:35,008 --> 01:06:38,100
Are you kidding me?
Hey, hey, let Dad handle it.

763
01:06:47,894 --> 01:06:50,269
Hey, there. I wasn't
expecting you guys today.

764
01:06:50,437 --> 01:06:52,029
- Surprise.
- What do you want'?

765
01:06:52,190 --> 01:06:54,315
Dean, just go back inside.
Who is this?

766
01:06:54,483 --> 01:06:56,825
Who am I?
Who the hell are you, asshole?

767
01:06:56,986 --> 01:06:58,282
- Watch your mouth.
- Hey.

768
01:06:58,444 --> 01:07:01,036
You pushing us around?
We'll examine your invoices.

769
01:07:01,197 --> 01:07:03,947
Have a warrant?
Mr. Whipple is aware of our rights.

770
01:07:04,117 --> 01:07:06,117
We'll go inside
and we'll handle this...

771
01:07:06,286 --> 01:07:10,207
They don't have a warrant. Fuck them.
Whipple, ask this person to leave.

772
01:07:10,373 --> 01:07:15,169
Dean, that's enough. Dean, go in...
Hey! Dean! Dean! Stop it!

773
01:07:15,335 --> 01:07:16,710
Stop it!
This person

774
01:07:16,877 --> 01:07:20,253
is telling you to take a hike.
What is wrong with you?

775
01:07:20,424 --> 01:07:23,095
We can handle this
another time. Give me a call.

776
01:07:23,259 --> 01:07:24,679
Handle it with no trouble.

777
01:07:24,844 --> 01:07:28,345
- There's an easier way to do this.
- I haven't done anything wrong.

778
01:07:28,514 --> 01:07:32,060
I don't know why we keep bending
over backwards for these assholes.

779
01:07:32,766 --> 01:07:35,517
Will you just calm down?
I'll handle this.

780
01:07:35,687 --> 01:07:38,857
You can't do
things like that, Dean.

781
01:09:05,809 --> 01:09:07,606
Come on.

782
01:09:08,353 --> 01:09:10,024
Why?

783
01:09:10,270 --> 01:09:13,316
I don't know, it's fun.
All right.

784
01:09:15,693 --> 01:09:17,988
Shit.
Shit. Go, go, go.

785
01:09:20,197 --> 01:09:22,243
Hey, come here.

786
01:09:23,032 --> 01:09:25,158
Hey. You're a real gem,
you know that?

787
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:28,624
I'm gonna get the cops on you so
you can join your dad in jail.

788
01:09:28,788 --> 01:09:32,288
Find your own boyfriend, old whore.
Cadence, come on.

789
01:09:55,062 --> 01:09:57,232
I told him never
to come here.

790
01:09:59,691 --> 01:10:03,737
Why am I getting calls from Meredith
saying you're tearing up her house?

791
01:10:03,945 --> 01:10:07,866
I don't know. Ask her.
I want this to work out. I do.

792
01:10:08,031 --> 01:10:10,531
If Meredith...
If she's telling you to fuck her

793
01:10:10,701 --> 01:10:12,202
in a cornfield somewhere.

794
01:10:14,996 --> 01:10:17,338
I don't want this to work out.

795
01:10:17,497 --> 01:10:21,839
I don't need anybody to take care
of me or ask me where I am at night.

796
01:10:23,086 --> 01:10:25,178
I'm not sad about it.

797
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:30,173
I don't think it's good anymore.
I didn't do anything wrong.

798
01:10:30,343 --> 01:10:32,934
I got bigger holes in my shoes
to be dealing with.

799
01:10:33,095 --> 01:10:35,061
Go fix your holes, then.

800
01:10:35,597 --> 01:10:37,939
Wait. Do you even know
what's happening now?

801
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:41,646
Dad won't get a lawyer.
He's guilty of cleaning those seeds.

802
01:10:41,811 --> 01:10:45,278
He didn't wanna tell you before your race.
Wait, what? Sorry, what?

803
01:10:48,192 --> 01:10:50,942
He didn't wanna tell you
before your big race.

804
01:10:53,698 --> 01:10:55,539
We'll lose everything.

805
01:10:56,325 --> 01:11:00,042
I've got coffee in the microwave.
It's getting cold.

806
01:11:01,036 --> 01:11:03,002
Cadence, wait.

807
01:11:04,206 --> 01:11:06,172
It's Byron, isn't it?

808
01:11:06,958 --> 01:11:08,958
Go help your dad out.

809
01:11:09,878 --> 01:11:11,753
He loves you a lot.

810
01:11:34,525 --> 01:11:37,321
Hi, Dean. What's up?
Call the agents off.

811
01:11:37,486 --> 01:11:39,486
Hey.
Right now. You hear me?

812
01:11:39,655 --> 01:11:42,747
Look, let's go talk
in the barn.

813
01:11:43,158 --> 01:11:46,034
It's okay, dear.
Everything's all right.

814
01:11:46,203 --> 01:11:48,498
Call Liberty,
tell them you made a mistake.

815
01:11:48,663 --> 01:11:50,334
<i>But I didn't...</i>

816
01:11:50,498 --> 01:11:55,750
Henry and I are both guilty.
If I reported him, I'd be in trouble too.

817
01:11:55,919 --> 01:11:58,295
Well, who reported us'?
I don't know.

818
01:11:58,922 --> 01:12:00,797
Who was it?
I don't know.

819
01:12:00,965 --> 01:12:03,091
Tell me who it was!

820
01:12:03,260 --> 01:12:06,931
Big farmers are very aggressive,
and your dad made a lot of enemies.

821
01:12:07,096 --> 01:12:10,017
And there's this guy...
Jim Johnson.

822
01:12:10,473 --> 01:12:12,768
It was Jim Johnson,
wasn't it?

823
01:12:41,752 --> 01:12:43,502
What is it?

824
01:12:44,255 --> 01:12:48,222
Dean knows. He just left my place.
Did he say where he was going?

825
01:12:48,383 --> 01:12:50,679
Henry.
Oh, goddamn, Dean.

826
01:12:50,844 --> 01:12:53,515
I know what he's going through.
If Grant was here...

827
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:56,271
Will you shut up about Grant!

828
01:12:56,808 --> 01:12:58,979
Those days are gone.

829
01:13:00,144 --> 01:13:02,065
I'm the one to blame.

830
01:13:06,065 --> 01:13:08,485
It was me, Henry.

831
01:13:22,913 --> 01:13:26,755
I've been a seed cleaner
my whole life.

832
01:13:26,918 --> 01:13:28,759
Now my kids
have to send me money

833
01:13:28,919 --> 01:13:31,045
so I can make it
through each month.

834
01:13:31,213 --> 01:13:33,259
Well, why didn't you ask me?

835
01:13:34,966 --> 01:13:36,841
I did.

836
01:13:37,509 --> 01:13:39,306
I asked you for work, remember?

837
01:13:40,512 --> 01:13:42,434
You wouldn't listen.

838
01:13:42,598 --> 01:13:45,724
So you went and made a deal
with Liberty Seeds, is that it?

839
01:13:45,934 --> 01:13:47,105
No.

840
01:13:47,978 --> 01:13:49,479
I didn't report you.

841
01:13:49,979 --> 01:13:51,150
Well, you just said...

842
01:13:51,314 --> 01:13:56,031
Some guy came snooping around a few
weeks back and got to talking.

843
01:13:56,985 --> 01:13:58,735
About you.

844
01:13:58,904 --> 01:14:00,825
He offered me money.

845
01:14:00,990 --> 01:14:03,411
Who?

846
01:14:03,992 --> 01:14:06,664
Who was it? I just couldn't refuse.

847
01:14:10,666 --> 01:14:12,086
Larry Brown.

848
01:14:51,576 --> 01:14:53,372
What do you want, man?

849
01:14:54,996 --> 01:14:58,713
Tell your dad to call off
the agents. Call them off!

850
01:14:59,167 --> 01:15:00,883
What's your problem?

851
01:15:07,424 --> 01:15:09,221
Call them off!

852
01:15:21,270 --> 01:15:22,737
Come on!

853
01:15:40,661 --> 01:15:43,333
Is that what it felt like
to lose ARCA, pussy?

854
01:15:45,125 --> 01:15:47,251
Is that what it felt like
to lose?

855
01:15:58,471 --> 01:16:00,597
Come on, get up! Get up!

856
01:16:06,811 --> 01:16:08,482
Come on!

857
01:16:56,897 --> 01:16:59,488
- Afternoon.
- Hi.

858
01:16:59,650 --> 01:17:03,651
Heat getting to you?
Doing all right, thanks.

859
01:17:04,695 --> 01:17:06,367
Hi, there.

860
01:17:06,906 --> 01:17:08,452
Are you Larry Brown?

861
01:17:08,616 --> 01:17:11,867
I thought I'd be too small for
a shark like you to remember.

862
01:17:12,035 --> 01:17:14,161
Oh, I don't know
about that.

863
01:17:14,330 --> 01:17:17,171
I'm Henry Whipple.
I know who you are.

864
01:17:17,332 --> 01:17:19,128
"Whipple wants you."

865
01:17:19,417 --> 01:17:22,668
Impossible not to smell
your shit from a mile away.

866
01:17:24,088 --> 01:17:26,714
Uh, look, uh...

867
01:17:26,882 --> 01:17:30,429
I just came over here
to talk things over with you.

868
01:17:30,594 --> 01:17:32,185
You're in trouble,
aren't you?

869
01:17:32,345 --> 01:17:36,596
Listen, Larry.
Uh, Mr. Brown. Mr. Brown.

870
01:17:39,017 --> 01:17:42,644
I need you to call off
those Liberty agents.

871
01:17:43,020 --> 01:17:44,487
You ruined me.

872
01:17:44,648 --> 01:17:47,319
I don't even know
what I've done to you.

873
01:17:47,483 --> 01:17:49,233
Well, let me
refresh your memory.

874
01:17:49,402 --> 01:17:51,903
You bought my land
at the Pritchard's funeral.

875
01:17:52,071 --> 01:17:54,197
I'd been renting that land
for 10 years.

876
01:17:54,364 --> 01:17:56,535
Me. Larry Brown.

877
01:17:56,701 --> 01:17:59,918
And you took it away
from me and my family.

878
01:18:02,372 --> 01:18:05,714
Well, I bought that land
fair and square.

879
01:18:05,876 --> 01:18:07,751
Legally.

880
01:18:08,334 --> 01:18:10,801
- And you've got...
- I've got nothing!

881
01:18:10,964 --> 01:18:14,555
I had 480 acres
and you took 200 of them.

882
01:18:14,967 --> 01:18:17,387
You're smart enough
to know what you've done.

883
01:18:17,552 --> 01:18:19,769
You put me out of business.

884
01:18:20,513 --> 01:18:23,014
"Expand or die," they say.

885
01:18:23,182 --> 01:18:25,683
Well, you killed me off good.

886
01:18:26,561 --> 01:18:30,403
But I still own this land
you're standing on,

887
01:18:30,982 --> 01:18:33,607
and I suggest you leave.

888
01:18:37,237 --> 01:18:39,487
Good afternoon, ma'am.

889
01:18:44,494 --> 01:18:46,244
Hey, buddy.

890
01:19:12,226 --> 01:19:13,727
Hello.

891
01:19:15,228 --> 01:19:16,774
Dean?

892
01:19:18,148 --> 01:19:19,615
What?

893
01:19:21,401 --> 01:19:23,117
Where are you?

894
01:19:41,586 --> 01:19:43,302
Dean!

895
01:19:45,547 --> 01:19:47,343
Dean!

896
01:19:50,386 --> 01:19:51,807
Dean!

897
01:19:56,224 --> 01:19:58,349
Dean, God.

898
01:19:59,351 --> 01:20:01,727
Dean, you all right?

899
01:20:03,563 --> 01:20:05,484
What happened?

900
01:20:43,975 --> 01:20:45,021
Is he dead?

901
01:20:56,193 --> 01:20:57,694
It was an accident.

902
01:23:13,860 --> 01:23:15,360
Ah.

903
01:23:47,639 --> 01:23:51,231
Have you noticed Dad's been out
three mornings in a row?

904
01:23:51,393 --> 01:23:52,518
No, I didn't notice.

905
01:24:32,096 --> 01:24:33,267
Henry.

906
01:24:36,517 --> 01:24:38,018
Hi.

907
01:24:38,185 --> 01:24:41,186
I'm leaving, Whipple.
Going out west.

908
01:24:41,813 --> 01:24:44,189
I might put you as a reference
if that's okay.

909
01:24:44,358 --> 01:24:47,075
So be expecting some calls.
Of course.

910
01:24:47,237 --> 01:24:50,204
Give them my number.
I'll sing your praises.

911
01:24:51,571 --> 01:24:53,117
Henry...

912
01:24:54,033 --> 01:24:55,284
Um...

913
01:24:55,451 --> 01:24:57,702
I just wanna thank you.

914
01:24:58,204 --> 01:25:00,579
While it was fun, I had fun,
you know?

915
01:25:10,006 --> 01:25:12,052
Oh, and make sure
and get Decatur back.

916
01:25:12,216 --> 01:25:15,387
You still have a month before
Customer Appreciation Day.

917
01:25:19,222 --> 01:25:25,216
In times of despair and
confusion, it is important to have hope.

918
01:25:26,895 --> 01:25:29,271
As lost sheep
in the eyes of our Lord,

919
01:25:29,439 --> 01:25:31,189
we need guidance

920
01:25:31,399 --> 01:25:36,741
in the face of the unknown
and uncertain future.

921
01:25:36,904 --> 01:25:39,325
Let us not become weary
in doing good,

922
01:25:39,490 --> 01:25:45,484
for at the proper time we will reap
a harvest if we do not give up.

923
01:25:46,162 --> 01:25:47,629
Galatians 6:9.

924
01:25:47,789 --> 01:25:51,039
The agents have examined
and cleared my invoices,

925
01:25:51,209 --> 01:25:53,551
and they say
that it's all up to you.

926
01:25:53,712 --> 01:25:57,338
This contract has everything
that you asked for.

927
01:25:57,506 --> 01:26:01,757
You can rent and work the land
free of charge, as a tenant.

928
01:26:01,927 --> 01:26:03,677
For life.

929
01:26:05,555 --> 01:26:08,305
Now, will you call off the agents?

930
01:26:23,446 --> 01:26:25,572
God may not answer immediately,

931
01:26:25,740 --> 01:26:30,287
but we will all be given that which
we are due in the eyes of the Lord.

932
01:26:31,786 --> 01:26:34,287
<i>For better or for worse.</i>

933
01:26:34,455 --> 01:26:38,456
<i>But when the time is right,
God will act.</i>

934
01:26:39,044 --> 01:26:42,670
<i>He will hold his hand out to you.</i>

935
01:26:42,838 --> 01:26:43,963
<i>So keep hope...</i>

936
01:26:44,131 --> 01:26:47,132
<i>Is he all right?
Close to your heart.</i>

937
01:26:47,926 --> 01:26:52,018
<i>And now please, rise and join me
in the Lord's Prayer.</i>

938
01:26:53,181 --> 01:26:55,523
<i>Our Father, who art in heaven,</i>

939
01:26:55,682 --> 01:27:01,184
hallowed be thy name,
thy kingdom come, thy will be done,

940
01:27:01,355 --> 01:27:03,821
on earth as it is in heaven.

941
01:27:04,483 --> 01:27:07,609
<i>Give us this day our daily bread,</i>

942
01:27:07,777 --> 01:27:09,823
<i>and forgive us our trespasses...</i>

943
01:27:09,987 --> 01:27:11,078
Brad!

944
01:27:11,238 --> 01:27:14,330
<i>As we forgive those
who trespass against us.</i>

945
01:27:15,701 --> 01:27:18,826
<i>And lead us not into temptation,</i>

946
01:27:19,329 --> 01:27:21,329
<i>but deliver us from evil.</i>

947
01:27:22,122 --> 01:27:27,715
For thine is the kingdom
and the power and the glory,

948
01:27:27,878 --> 01:27:31,424
<i>forever and ever. Amen.</i>

949
01:27:35,719 --> 01:27:38,390
This is Iowa. Right here
you can see Green County.

950
01:27:38,555 --> 01:27:41,055
And this right here,
you recognize this?

951
01:27:41,224 --> 01:27:43,224
That's your property.
That's your farm.

952
01:27:43,393 --> 01:27:46,065
Zoom in. Right here,
your soil temperatures.

953
01:27:46,562 --> 01:27:51,064
Very specific. Up to the minute.
Very cutting-edge. Over your property.

954
01:27:51,233 --> 01:27:53,825
This is right now,
as we stand here.

955
01:27:55,277 --> 01:27:58,244
This is us right here.

956
01:28:04,204 --> 01:28:05,795
Jim.

957
01:28:07,998 --> 01:28:09,623
Jim.

958
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,375
I am so sorry.

959
01:28:14,921 --> 01:28:16,762
I, uh...

960
01:28:18,174 --> 01:28:20,174
I want to tell you something.

961
01:28:20,342 --> 01:28:23,467
No. There's nothing to say,
Henry.

962
01:28:24,389 --> 01:28:26,514
We're still hopeful.

963
01:28:27,307 --> 01:28:31,682
But I know that with each day
that goes by, it's less likely that...

964
01:28:35,148 --> 01:28:37,819
When he was little,
I would tell him,

965
01:28:38,401 --> 01:28:40,696
as long as I was alive,

966
01:28:40,861 --> 01:28:43,203
nothing could happen to him.

967
01:28:53,622 --> 01:28:56,088
Jim, we're so sorry
to hear about your son.

968
01:28:56,249 --> 01:28:58,716
That's very
kind of you, Bobbie.

969
01:28:59,753 --> 01:29:02,674
You're in our prayers, Jim.
Okay.

970
01:29:07,092 --> 01:29:10,218
I wanna say that, um...

971
01:29:14,015 --> 01:29:19,358
What I wanna say is that I just
got back from Decatur with Dean.

972
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:23,111
And he took an order
for next season

973
01:29:23,273 --> 01:29:26,649
from a customer of yours,
Wilbur Bastian.

974
01:29:26,819 --> 01:29:28,569
Oh, well...

975
01:29:28,737 --> 01:29:32,704
Right, Wilbur.
He's called me a couple of times.

976
01:29:32,865 --> 01:29:35,206
I just haven't been able
to get down there.

977
01:29:35,367 --> 01:29:38,834
It means that Decatur
is my territory again.

978
01:29:41,372 --> 01:29:44,123
And I want to apologize.

979
01:29:46,628 --> 01:29:50,970
I'm gonna make sure that
Dean transfers that sale to you.

980
01:29:51,132 --> 01:29:54,883
Why, Henry?
Business is business.

981
01:29:57,387 --> 01:30:01,853
No, Dean's done right.
You should be proud of him.

982
01:30:14,945 --> 01:30:16,537
Jim.

983
01:30:17,279 --> 01:30:19,325
Isn't there something more?

984
01:30:22,576 --> 01:30:25,826
I'll see you at the next
Liberty meeting, Henry.

985
01:31:24,007 --> 01:31:25,803
Henry, did you eat?

986
01:31:25,967 --> 01:31:28,592
I left your dinner in the fridge.

987
01:31:31,597 --> 01:31:33,348
Henry?

988
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:42,146
It's Brad Johnson, isn't it?

989
01:31:49,613 --> 01:31:51,659
Did Dean do it?

990
01:31:55,285 --> 01:31:56,876
No.

991
01:32:00,456 --> 01:32:02,252
It was me.

992
01:32:04,709 --> 01:32:06,710
It, uh...

993
01:32:08,962 --> 01:32:11,463
it was an accident.

994
01:32:16,219 --> 01:32:21,311
I... I didn't know what to do. I...

995
01:32:24,644 --> 01:32:27,394
I don't know what to do.

996
01:33:16,107 --> 01:33:18,107
We're a team.

997
01:33:23,113 --> 01:33:25,034
We're a team.

998
01:33:29,118 --> 01:33:34,744
And you and I are gonna pick
ourselves up by our bootstraps.

999
01:33:36,333 --> 01:33:39,504
We're gonna keep
a smile on our face.

1000
01:33:41,338 --> 01:33:44,509
We're gonna work real hard.

1001
01:33:46,677 --> 01:33:50,769
In less than a month,
it's Customer Appreciation Day.

1002
01:33:52,640 --> 01:33:55,356
And after that's the harvest.

1003
01:33:58,603 --> 01:34:01,353
It's gonna be a great harvest.

1004
01:35:18,257 --> 01:35:21,633
<i>Dear Mom and Dad,
I made it to the top.</i>

1005
01:35:21,803 --> 01:35:25,680
<i>The sky is so clear,
I can see all the way to Iowa.</i>

1006
01:35:26,389 --> 01:35:29,606
<i>I wonder if this is how God feels.</i>

1007
01:35:29,769 --> 01:35:32,519
<i>Inside are some earrings
for you, Mom.</i>

1008
01:35:32,687 --> 01:35:35,483
<i>You always looked beautiful
in this color.</i>

1009
01:35:37,274 --> 01:35:40,366
<i>Dad, I hope you'll be proud of me.</i>

1010
01:35:40,820 --> 01:35:42,320
<i>I'll be home soon.</i>

1011
01:35:43,072 --> 01:35:46,198
<i>Love, Grant.</i>

1012
01:35:59,670 --> 01:36:02,216
Thank you, sir.
I think that one's cooked.

1013
01:36:02,380 --> 01:36:03,756
How you doing,
sweetheart?

1014
01:36:03,966 --> 01:36:06,591
Yeah, of course. Thanks
for coming out, guys. Hi.

1015
01:36:07,635 --> 01:36:09,931
Is he still up?

1016
01:36:12,849 --> 01:36:14,849
Oh, that's wonderful.

1017
01:36:17,144 --> 01:36:20,315
You're making your family
very proud, sonny boy.

1018
01:36:20,479 --> 01:36:22,445
What I'm supposed to do.
Damn right.

1019
01:36:22,606 --> 01:36:23,777
All right.

1020
01:36:23,941 --> 01:36:26,112
Keep it up.
Thanks.

1021
01:36:26,694 --> 01:36:28,740
- Hello, everybody.
- Hello.

1022
01:36:28,903 --> 01:36:33,745
And welcome to Whipple's 12th
Annual Customer Appreciation Day.

1023
01:36:36,661 --> 01:36:40,333
I hope everybody here is enjoying
the Hickory Park barbecue

1024
01:36:40,498 --> 01:36:42,294
and the Picket Fence ice cream.

1025
01:36:42,458 --> 01:36:46,335
Some of us love it a little bit
more than others. Hee-hoo.

1026
01:36:48,339 --> 01:36:51,089
Now, this summer,
we won back Decatur,

1027
01:36:51,259 --> 01:36:55,226
making us number one
in seven counties again.

1028
01:36:58,973 --> 01:37:01,099
But more importantly,

1029
01:37:01,684 --> 01:37:05,980
I got a son to inherit
the family farm.

1030
01:37:08,106 --> 01:37:10,106
It's what I always wanted.

1031
01:37:12,778 --> 01:37:16,278
So am I a happy man?
Yeah.

1032
01:37:17,197 --> 01:37:20,073
- Am I a happy man?
- Yeah.

1033
01:37:20,785 --> 01:37:23,001
How could I not be?

1034
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:28,831
But today, I choose to value you.

1035
01:37:29,001 --> 01:37:31,501
Each and every one of you.

1036
01:37:32,085 --> 01:37:33,711
Thank you.

1037
01:37:33,880 --> 01:37:36,471
And happy
Customer Appreciation Day.

1038
01:37:36,633 --> 01:37:37,929
Yeah.

1039
01:37:38,424 --> 01:37:40,891
Now I'd like to get my son up here.

1040
01:37:41,054 --> 01:37:43,304
The future of Whipple & Sons,

1041
01:37:43,471 --> 01:37:46,597
Dean Whipple.
Dean, come on up here.

1042
01:37:50,268 --> 01:37:52,144
Thank you, Dad.

1043
01:38:00,153 --> 01:38:04,245
So we mentioned Decatur
and winning.

1044
01:38:04,907 --> 01:38:08,283
In my years as a racer,
before I was injured,

1045
01:38:08,451 --> 01:38:11,998
I won just about every trophy
figure-eight racing had to offer.

1046
01:38:12,164 --> 01:38:15,835
I know what it takes to be number one.
That is the level of success

1047
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:19,126
that I will bring to each
and every one of your fields.
