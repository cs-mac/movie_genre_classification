167
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:41,143
l mean my boss and yours--Taha.

168
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,915
Taha can go fuck himself.

169
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,960
What the fuck is wrong
with everyone today?

170
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:53,784
Get in there.

171
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:04,431
Hey, K2.
ls she me birthday present?

172
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:05,663
Well, l'd love a piece of her.

173
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,968
She looks just my size.

174
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,371
- Feck off.
- Watch your hands.

175
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:11,033
Hey, we got to search her, huh?

176
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,577
We already did.
She's clean.

177
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:14,977
Come on. Share the wealth.
Leave us her panties.

178
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:16,275
When l come back,
l'll bite your balls off.

179
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:17,747
l got other plans
for your mouth.

180
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:19,681
You'll like it a lot more, huh?

181
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,447
That's for openers, slimeball.

182
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:25,479
Hands off her.
l said she's with Taha.

183
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:26,956
And you cut that shit out, OK?

184
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,628
lt's me.

185
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:43,869
As you can see,
it's a real bargain.

186
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,002
lt's simple to use and erotic...

187
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:48,069
K2 is here.

188
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:49,478
You can't beat it.

189
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:52,214
l know your face.
Show me the girl.

190
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,079
OK. Bring her up here.

191
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:58,783
Make sure he knows
we got his sister.

192
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:00,381
Spread the news.

193
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:03,486
Say, l wish l could see
the cocksucker...

194
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:04,688
when they tell him
what happened.

195
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:07,893
You're not gonna ever know...

196
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,594
you son of a bitch.

197
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:11,431
Why don't l cut you open now...
and that'll be the end of it?

198
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:12,993
Cut me and there's
a pack of wild dogs...

199
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:14,300
that are going to be
without a master...

200
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:15,806
and they might not be too cool.

201
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:16,966
What are you after?

202
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:17,974
You see, Taha,
that's the difference...

203
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:18,975
between the two of us.

204
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:20,136
You never know
what's in my head...

205
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:22,146
but l know all the shit
that's going on in yours.

206
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:23,476
l'm always one step
ahead of you...

207
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:24,675
because l know
what you're thinking.

208
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,548
Hold it, K2.
lt's OK.

209
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,417
Stay nice and calm.
We're just talking.

210
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,513
Yeah. Just talking.

211
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,387
Look, tell me
what the fuck you want...

212
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:35,518
and stop busting my balls
and let's get this over with.

213
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:37,186
Two things.

214
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:38,354
Yeah? Go on.

215
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:39,522
You leave my building alone.

216
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:41,225
No dealer for
500 meters around it.

217
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,765
Yeah. OK.
What else?

218
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,169
That's easy.
Your life for my sister's.

219
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:50,371
l let you go,
l walk outside with her...

220
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:51,875
and if none of you guys move,
we got a deal.

221
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:53,411
You know you should've
gone into business?

222
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:54,503
Yes or no?

223
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,740
OK. lt's a deal.

224
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:57,076
l got your word?

225
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:58,776
She ain't enough for you?

226
00:16:58,851 --> 00:16:59,977
Give the order.

227
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:01,519
Yeah, K2, let her go.
You heard me?

228
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:03,214
Wait downstairs.

229
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:04,755
K2, you stop
your fuckin' thinking...

230
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:07,223
and do what l'm telling you to do.

231
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:08,953
Get down now,
or you'll never get up again.

232
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:18,266
Look. l kept my word.
She's free...

233
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:19,395
so now let go of me.

234
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:20,563
Patience, Taha.

235
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:26,910
You think you're going
to get out of here in one piece?

236
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:28,571
You think everyone here's
your buddy?

237
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:33,182
Listen. l got a deal
with this guy, OK?

238
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:35,550
l said that he
and his sister could go...

239
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:36,747
and so make sure nobody moves...

240
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:38,084
and everything'll be cool.

241
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:52,963
Hey, you.

242
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:04,408
Open your mouth.

243
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:10,314
Chew it, pig.

244
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:13,817
She's my kind of girl.

245
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:15,689
You can't have her.
Go on.

246
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:27,872
Let's go!
Move it! Let's go!

247
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:03,708
Get out of the way!
Come on! Move it!

248
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:05,436
This way! Faster!

249
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:13,915
Let's get out of here.

250
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,476
- Over here.
- Come on, man.

251
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:16,714
Right.

252
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:19,586
Hey, get that--
rid of that fucking thing. Hurry.

253
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:20,750
Come on. Move it!

254
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,657
Stop your vehicle.

255
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:28,199
Stop your vehicle!

256
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:33,230
OK, hold it. Take it easy.

257
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:34,602
We brought you a customer.

258
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:40,874
We want the inspector!

259
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:45,776
Make way for us.
We're coming in.

260
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:04,702
Son of a bitch.

261
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:07,102
Hey, can't you settle
your score someplace else?

262
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:08,400
'Cause we're closing up here.

263
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:10,168
lt's Taha.
Taha Ben-Mahmoud.

264
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:11,436
Doesn't that name
mean something to you?

265
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,568
l know him, but l told you.

266
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:14,703
We're closing up by orders
of the government.

267
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,941
So if you can't show me
some proof, l can't do anything.

268
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,685
Five kilos of heroin...

269
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:22,617
taken from his desk
with two witnesses.

270
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:23,655
How's that?

271
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,097
There are too many
of them outside.

272
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:40,331
Grab them.

273
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:43,897
OK, OK.
Since you insist.

274
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:45,568
But first, your weapons.
Hand 'em over.

275
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:47,509
And you, men,
keep your eye on Taha.

276
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:50,073
l bet you really think...

277
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:51,410
it's going to change something, don't you?

278
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:53,451
Maybe not much,
but you got to start somewhere.

279
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,854
Now we're going to eliminate
the paperwork, OK?

280
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,253
You go into the cell...

281
00:20:58,323 --> 00:20:59,620
and you pick up
your dope and clear out.

282
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:01,522
Don't do that,
for Christ's sake.

283
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,026
lf you let him go,
it'll be worse than before.

284
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,494
lt won't be worse,
'cause we're getting out.

285
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:05,996
When the shit falls,
we'll be far away.

286
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:07,929
You won't be here,
but it's still going to go on...

287
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,831
and you're the ones
who are supposed to stop it.

288
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:11,129
l'll bet that you
still believe that.

289
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:13,501
The barbed wire and the walls.
Did you forget all that?

290
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:14,561
They're going to put
a lid on it...

291
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,766
and blow it all up.

292
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:17,638
That's what they'll do
to make the shit disappear.

293
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:18,937
As for you,
be grateful you're here...

294
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:20,103
because there are
some guys outside...

295
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:22,146
ready to make
dead meat out of you.

296
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:23,545
Why the hell are you still here?

297
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:24,912
Like you said, there are
a lot of guys out there...

298
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:26,280
who are ready to do
what l tell 'em to.

299
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:28,578
Stop that shit, Taha.

300
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:29,746
You're free.
You've got your dope.

301
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:31,948
What the hell more do you want?

302
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:33,116
The bitch.

303
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:35,056
No!

304
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,287
No!

305
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:39,455
Now get out.

306
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:40,964
No!

307
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:42,500
l'm warning you.
Touch me and you're--

308
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:45,425
Lola! Lola!

309
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:47,631
Don't worry.
l'll take good care of her.

310
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:50,535
Gentlemen,
it's always a pleasure...

311
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:52,577
to do business with you.

312
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:54,168
So long.

313
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:56,840
No! No!

314
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:09,457
Take her to my office,
tie her up...

315
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:10,688
and give her two grams.

316
00:22:10,762 --> 00:22:12,059
That'll calm her down.

317
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,464
OK, OK.
Let's get back to work now.

318
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,407
l didn't have any choice, kid...

319
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:27,444
l've been in this area
for fifteen years.

320
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:30,039
l'm retired as of tonight...

321
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:31,446
and l'd like
to take advantage of it.

322
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:34,118
lt was her or me.

323
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:36,254
l'm sorry.

324
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:40,957
You should've chosen my sister.
You're already dead.

325
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,577
Digame, Pedro, huh?

326
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:00,736
What you got against my car?

327
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:01,904
My name's not Pedro.

328
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,413
Who gives a fuck
your name's not Pedro?

329
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:05,416
l'm talking about
my car, cojone.

330
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:06,644
What if l crashed your head...

331
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:09,380
every time l wanted you
to keep quiet?

332
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:11,388
Hey, it's only a car.

333
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:13,117
No, it's not only a car.

334
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:15,022
lt's my car, maricon.

335
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:17,425
l just had it overhauled
and it cost me a fortune.

336
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:18,588
So l suggest you show...

337
00:23:18,663 --> 00:23:20,494
some fucking respect
for my car...

338
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:23,432
or you'll find yourself
under the wheels.

339
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:24,764
Comprende?

340
00:23:24,836 --> 00:23:26,394
Forget it, Carlos.
He didn't do it on purpose.

341
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:27,563
- Come on.
- What the fuck's...

342
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:29,266
the matter with that guy, huh?

343
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:30,433
l'm sick of these kids.

344
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:31,942
They don't respect anything.

345
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,978
Anybody can close a door
without slamming it.

346
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:35,307
lt's OK.
He's going to take...

347
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,642
good care of your car
from now on.

348
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:38,910
- Right, Pedro?
- My name is not Pedro.

349
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:41,111
Once more,
that door's got a squeak.

350
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:42,448
The garage takes a fortune...

351
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:45,217
and gives me back the car
with a squeaky fucking door.

352
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,053
l'll get rid of
the squeaking, Carlos.

353
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:48,422
l-l promise you.

354
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,056
We got to recruit better, Benito.

355
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,256
lt's getting bad.

356
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:54,889
Remind me to talk to Frank.

357
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:56,456
- OK.
- Tired of getting all these...

358
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:58,833
Portuguese guys.
Soldiers today.

359
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:00,166
Campesinos.

360
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:01,830
l'll talk to Frank
about it. Don't worry.

361
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:05,070
l want men with
an education, damn it.

362
00:24:05,143 --> 00:24:07,976
Hire good prospects as soon
as they get out of school.

363
00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:09,308
Guys who want
to use their brains...

364
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:10,905
instead of hanging out all day.

365
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:13,746
Benito, there are
six million unemployed...

366
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:15,081
in this fucking country.

367
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:17,417
Two or three shouldn't be
so fucking hard to find, huh?

368
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:20,151
Yeah. Frank'll get us
some good men, that's for sure.

369
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:21,852
Well, what are you staring at?

370
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:25,427
There we go.

371
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:43,137
Place your bets.

372
00:24:45,383 --> 00:24:47,510
- Twenty-seven.
- Don't forget me, Carlos.

373
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:49,281
Hey, no problem, Yeti.

374
00:24:49,354 --> 00:24:50,616
l know you won't.

375
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:52,486
End of the week, as usual, huh?

376
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:55,117
Hey, puta...

377
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:57,457
cajones...

378
00:24:57,529 --> 00:24:58,826
reminded me about a kickback...

379
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:00,091
with all the money he owes us.

380
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:03,794
No education nowadays,
huh, Benito?

381
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:06,831
Downstairs.

382
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:18,275
Everything's OK, Samy?

383
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,681
No. Things are pretty terrible.

384
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:21,878
Oh, yeah. What's wrong now?

385
00:25:24,122 --> 00:25:25,111
Everyone you see is a cop?

386
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,418
One there. Two there.

387
00:25:26,491 --> 00:25:27,753
They've already spent an hour...

388
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:29,293
chasing a can of corn.

389
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,293
Ah. They're perverts.

390
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:31,454
Perverts?
What are they doing...

391
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,622
in the food section?

392
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:34,426
Nada. They're just waiting
for 2 a.m...

393
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:36,296
when the hookers use
the coffee machine there. See?

394
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:38,728
You got here at 1 :10...

395
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:41,897
and outside,
look what's happening now.

396
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:45,474
- What's that?
- Perverts...

397
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:46,841
and l don't think
they're going to spend...

398
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:48,209
hours looking for corn.

399
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,577
Anything else suspicious?

400
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:50,706
Yeah. Most of
our regular players...

401
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:51,874
didn't show up tonight.

402
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:53,440
lt just happens
to be the one day...

403
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:54,815
we transfer our money.

404
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:56,376
Yeah? So you're saying?

405
00:25:56,454 --> 00:25:58,888
That a real big transfer
can be very tempting.

406
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:00,948
All you have to do
is put the cops onto the deal...

407
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:02,618
and you get ten percent
of the money with no risk.

408
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:03,956
How do you know that, anyway?

409
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:05,496
'Cause l've already
been offered it.

410
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:06,656
You must have been tempted.

411
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:07,823
How can you be sure...

412
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,127
it was a real cop
who approached you?

413
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,828
Uh-huh.
You're pretty clever, huh?

414
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,427
lt's the only way to stay alive.

415
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:15,700
That's for sure.
You went to school, right?

416
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:17,469
Economics.
Bachelor's degree.

417
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:20,636
Yeah, l was right.
You see the difference, huh?

418
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:26,245
So, somebody's trying
to rob us, huh?

419
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:29,544
And rob us big time, too.

420
00:26:41,566 --> 00:26:44,626
Didn't l tell you that Pedro guy
was pretty fuckin' weird?

421
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:46,933
- He and the puta.
- His name wasn't--

422
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:48,097
Oh, who cares what his name was?

423
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:49,606
l ain't putting up
any monument, huh?

424
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:51,972
OK. Grab the money.
Let's go.

425
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:54,773
No one's going anywhere.
Sacks down, hands up, huh?

426
00:26:54,846 --> 00:26:55,870
Benito, what are you doing?

427
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:58,472
l'm not Benito anymore.
The name's Damien.

428
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,177
First attack division.
Carlos Montoya...

429
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:01,878
you are under arrest.
Get it?

430
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,352
Benito, you gotta be--

431
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:05,616
You have the right
to remain silent.

432
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,783
Whatever you say
can be used against you.

433
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:09,349
Any threatening gesture
or false movement...

434
00:27:09,427 --> 00:27:11,019
will be considered as
a refusal to cooperate...

435
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:12,188
thus putting my agents...

436
00:27:12,263 --> 00:27:14,094
in a position of self-defense. Clear?

437
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:15,427
What does all that shit mean?

438
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,626
lt means one false move...

439
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:18,134
and l'll paint
the place red. Capito?

440
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:19,670
Yeah, yeah.
And how do you think...

441
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:21,205
you're going to get
out of here in one piece?

442
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:23,536
We're going to stick
around here some more.

443
00:27:23,608 --> 00:27:25,633
Samy, you and your friends,
clear out.

444
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,550
Why the hell
did you let them go?

445
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:41,715
Because you're the big one.

446
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:42,919
Chameleon in place.
Are you guys all set?

447
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:44,859
We are, Chameleon.
Here it comes.

448
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:51,265
What do we do now?

449
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,531
- What are you asking me for?
- You went to school.

450
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:54,697
Come on. Enough of that.

451
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:05,409
What's going on?

452
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:12,914
You OK?
Nothing broken?

453
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:14,788
- No, no. l'm OK.
- Good.

454
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,363
Chameleon to carrier.
The delivery's ready.

455
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:23,867
Commencing operation.

456
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:31,331
OK. Come on out of there, sir, please.

457
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:43,851
What now, Einstein?

458
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,463
Hurry up!
Things are getting hot here.

459
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:12,073
The wire, for fuck's sake.

460
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:22,182
Hey, you better send me
some ammo, quick!

461
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:48,975
They didn't take the money!
We'll split it!

462
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:50,350
Go on! Shut the door!

463
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:25,969
Go on. They're waiting for you.

464
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,278
What a great sense of timing
you guys got.

465
00:32:38,022 --> 00:32:38,954
OK, guys, go!

466
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:40,115
Go, go, go, come on!

467
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:42,659
This way.
This way, please, everyone.

468
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:46,894
Come on, come on, man.
Come on, you two.

469
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,432
Good job, man.

470
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:50,967
Calling all units.
Operation terminated.

471
00:32:53,237 --> 00:32:54,704
Captain!

472
00:32:54,772 --> 00:32:56,330
You're the fucking biggest
son of a bitch...

473
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:58,034
l ever met, you scumbag!

474
00:32:58,109 --> 00:33:00,407
That's the first compliment
l've had all day.

475
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:01,968
When l think that
l trusted you like a brother.

476
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:04,810
A brother? You mean
like shining your car for 6 months...

477
00:33:04,882 --> 00:33:06,213
before giving me
a real job?

478
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:08,582
Oh, that door of yours,
the one that squeaks...

479
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:23,597
Doesn't squeak anymore.

480
00:33:24,969 --> 00:33:26,163
Captain Commissar,
Colonel.

481
00:33:26,237 --> 00:33:27,431
Thank you. Show him in.

482
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:32,002
Hello, Damien.

483
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:34,044
l'd have much preferred
simply to congratulate you...

484
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:35,374
for last night's operation.

485
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:36,879
Unfortunately, however,
we have a real emergency.

486
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:38,040
Sit down.

487
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:40,107
l'd rather stand
if it's OK with you, sir.

488
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:41,208
As you like.

489
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:43,344
You know Mr. Kruger,
the Secretary of State...

490
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:45,946
for the Defense,
and Mr. Corsini, his assistant?

491
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,355
They need a man of courage...

492
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:49,256
for an extremely
delicate mission.

493
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:52,125
Mr. Kruger, l'll let you
explain the situation.

494
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:53,288
lt happened yesterday.

495
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:54,592
ln the afternoon,
we were transferring...

496
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:56,428
material in an armored vehicle...

497
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:59,698
when we had
what you might call a little incident.

498
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:02,672
No, no, no. l don't want
your dirty sponge.

499
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,207
lt'll scratch the window.

500
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:05,640
Shit.

501
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:10,341
One day l'll get them for that.

502
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:19,848
The good news
is that the vehicle...

503
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:21,016
had a lot of tracers in it...

504
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:22,559
so we know exactly
where it's located...

505
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:24,254
and we're asking you
to get it back.

506
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:25,625
Where is it?

507
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:40,574
What's inside the truck?

508
00:34:44,982 --> 00:34:47,109
What is this shit, anyway?

509
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:48,277
An experimental
scatter-type bomb...

510
00:34:48,352 --> 00:34:49,979
sometimes known as
a clean bomb.

511
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:52,852
lt's a prototype based
on neutron technology.

512
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,516
Medium range
about 8 kilometers.

513
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,889
The waves are
of short duration.

514
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,450
They're absorbed very fast.

515
00:34:57,528 --> 00:34:58,620
The risk of polluting
the atmosphere...

516
00:34:58,696 --> 00:34:59,628
is close to zero.

517
00:34:59,697 --> 00:35:01,187
You're worried they'll move the bomb.
ls that it?

518
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:07,303
lt wouldn't be so clean
in the center of town, would it?

519
00:35:07,371 --> 00:35:09,339
Yes, and that's one
of our primary concerns.

520
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:10,499
What's more,
the bomb is equipped...

521
00:35:10,575 --> 00:35:13,203
with a timing mechanism
set for 24 hours.

522
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:14,972
Unfortunately, it was
triggered accidentally...

523
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:16,707
and that was exactly
one hour ago.

524
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,043
You mean in 23 hours, it'll--

525
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,947
lt'll explode.

526
00:35:20,017 --> 00:35:21,177
K2.

527
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:22,184
Yeah?

528
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:23,720
You got exactly 23 hours
to sell this mother.

529
00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:29,224
Can't be done. Too short.

530
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:31,318
Captain, we're not asking
for your advice on this.

531
00:35:31,395 --> 00:35:33,192
We're trying to explain
your mission to you.

532
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:34,754
Colonel, you know
the way l function.

533
00:35:34,832 --> 00:35:36,197
l study the terrain
for weeks and weeks...

534
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:37,529
then it takes me months to infiltrate.

535
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:39,593
Damien, there are 2 million people
living out there...

536
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,069
and maybe half of them
are scum of the earth...

537
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,004
but the other half
are entitled to our assistance.

538
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:44,735
So you're gonna change
the way you operate...

539
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,299
unless you don't care anymore about
saving innocent people.

540
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:48,072
But accepting a mission
that's a lost cause...

541
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,443
is totally crazy.

542
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:51,106
You want me to defuse a bomb
in the worst barrio...

543
00:35:51,182 --> 00:35:52,615
where l've never even been.

544
00:35:52,683 --> 00:35:53,775
Couldn't be more attractive.

545
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:55,716
As far as the site goes,
we found you a local guide.

546
00:35:55,786 --> 00:35:57,811
Plus l've got
to work with someone?

547
00:35:57,889 --> 00:35:59,982
He's a young man
who was born there.

548
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:01,149
He knows the barrio
like a book.

549
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:02,487
So he'll save you
a lot of precious time.

550
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,084
And this guy,
did you force him to do it...

551
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,857
- or is he a volunteer?
- He doesn't know yet.

552
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:07,022
We're counting on you
to convince him.

553
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,580
- Where to?
- Shut up.

554
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:55,039
Let go of me!

555
00:36:55,112 --> 00:36:56,875
Let go of me, for fuck's sake.

556
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:05,986
Come on, get up.

557
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:15,829
Prisoner 7 1 3 in the van!

558
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:19,761
He fuckin' bit me,
the asshole.

559
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:35,881
You OK?

560
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:37,147
Never better.

561
00:37:37,221 --> 00:37:38,711
The fucker thought l let him
kick the shit out of me...

562
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:40,586
without doing anything.

563
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:42,250
Well, l'm getting out of here.

564
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:45,253
You think playing around
with the lock...

565
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:46,591
is really gonna
open the door?

566
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:48,495
You say that because
you don't know who l am yet.

567
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:49,692
The name's Phantom Man.

568
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,166
And Phantom Man doesn't plan...

569
00:37:51,235 --> 00:37:52,327
spending eight years locked up.

570
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:54,098
What did they get you for?

571
00:37:54,171 --> 00:37:56,264
Blew away five guys.

572
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,807
They weren't the right ones.

573
00:37:57,875 --> 00:37:59,604
The guy l wanted got away.

574
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:00,905
What you want him for?

575
00:38:03,514 --> 00:38:05,539
He murdered my father
and my two brothers.

576
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:07,743
And it hurts to know
this guy's still breathing.

577
00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:08,910
So soon as l'm out of here...

578
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:09,975
l head for the Barrio 1 3...

579
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:12,113
and finish the bastard off
for good.

580
00:38:12,189 --> 00:38:13,281
Does he live there?

581
00:38:13,357 --> 00:38:15,291
Yeah, and he's gonna die there.

582
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:18,653
What's the guy's name?

583
00:38:18,729 --> 00:38:20,128
Taha. You know him?

584
00:38:21,365 --> 00:38:23,196
You're not missing much.

585
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:24,427
l made the big mistake
of trying to do...

586
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:25,833
some business with the guy.

587
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:27,336
He lives in a kind of hangar...

588
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:28,963
with an army protecting him.

589
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,905
And he struts
around the place...

590
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:33,000
him and his human vegetable.

591
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:34,442
What human vegetable?

592
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:36,412
A junkie. He keeps her on a leash...

593
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,708
like a dog or something.

594
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:39,647
l never saw anyone
so doped up.

595
00:38:40,851 --> 00:38:42,079
Lola's her name,
l think.

596
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,854
l'll be back in two minutes flat, OK?

597
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:05,770
Hey, there's a space
here in front.

598
00:39:11,615 --> 00:39:13,515
Can l drop you somewhere?

599
00:39:13,584 --> 00:39:15,313
Barrio 1 3 will be fine.

600
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:16,546
You got it.

601
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:17,917
Damien.

602
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,399
OK.

603
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:32,561
They've left the prison.

604
00:39:32,636 --> 00:39:33,728
The plan's going
according to schedule.

605
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:34,964
Are they still together?

606
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,199
Yes. They're in front of the van.

607
00:39:36,273 --> 00:39:37,570
Shouldn't be hard
to spot them.

608
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:38,733
Excellent.

609
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:39,867
Congratulations, Colonel.

610
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:41,468
l wouldn't claim victory so quickly.

611
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:42,773
lt's much easier
to get out of prison...

612
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:44,439
than it is to enter Barrio 1 3.

613
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:45,914
And that's when we're gonna see
how good a guide...

614
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:48,878
Damien's gonna be
out of luck.

615
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:51,080
Your captain
can take care of himself.

616
00:40:05,803 --> 00:40:07,600
l'm gonna need your help,
'cause l don't know the way.

617
00:40:07,671 --> 00:40:09,730
Any idea how we can sneak in discreetly?

618
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:10,933
Yeah, go straight.

619
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:13,474
Hey, cut the shit out.
What are you doing?

620
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:15,535
l won't lose you this way.

621
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:18,013
Take those fucking things off me.

622
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,413
You want to get inside?

623
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:20,575
Yeah.

624
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:22,084
Then from now on, asshole,
l'm Phantom Man...

625
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:23,347
and you're gonna do
whatever l want.

626
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:24,445
Now floor it, huh?

627
00:40:26,857 --> 00:40:28,119
And what the fuck we do now?

628
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:29,420
Go on, straight ahead.

629
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,280
OK, turn right now.

630
00:40:55,886 --> 00:40:56,978
Turn right, l said!

631
00:40:57,054 --> 00:41:00,114
Hey, l heard you the first time,
but the wheels won't turn.

632
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:01,715
OK, stop the car.

633
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:03,384
The brakes are gone, too!

634
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:10,457
Then stop it
against another car...

635
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:11,626
but go easy.

636
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:18,502
l didn't say
to smash the car.

637
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:20,510
OK, sorry.
Did the best l could.

638
00:41:20,578 --> 00:41:22,876
But no one's stopping you
from getting a new driver.

639
00:41:22,947 --> 00:41:24,141
Now let me go.

640
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:26,410
What's wrong?
Should feel at home, man.

641
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:27,576
What are you talking about?

642
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:28,709
You're a cop.

643
00:41:28,786 --> 00:41:30,481
And a cop who thinks
l'm an idiot doesn't live long.

644
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:33,514
This is where you wanted me
to take you.

645
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:35,183
OK, so you're here.

646
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:36,487
Now take out
your police manual...

647
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,084
and look at the page that says
''l'm up shit creek.''

648
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:41,656
lt's true. Let me go,
for fuck's sake.

649
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:42,858
lt's thanks to me
you're out of jail.

650
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:44,400
Yeah, l wonder why
you did that.

651
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:46,095
Somebody needs me
to be set free.

652
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,660
But whatever the reason,
whatever the deal...

653
00:41:47,738 --> 00:41:48,932
count me out.

654
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:51,566
Even if it's
to save your sister?

655
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:53,735
She doesn't need anyone
except her brother.

656
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:00,176
Fuck!

657
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:22,996
Hey, you know that's my car
you just fucking wrecked.

658
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:25,439
Sorry, man. l broke out
of jail an hour ago.

659
00:42:25,509 --> 00:42:26,806
This piece of shit
didn't have any brakes...

660
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:28,310
so l was coming here
for a little shelter.

661
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:31,280
For shelter?
Ha ha ha!

662
00:42:31,348 --> 00:42:33,077
You got
some bad directions, man...

663
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,208
'cause this ain't Monaco.

664
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:35,377
lt's Baghdad.

665
00:43:16,727 --> 00:43:18,126
Tell 'em to calm down.

666
00:43:18,195 --> 00:43:19,822
Cool it.

667
00:43:19,897 --> 00:43:21,091
Easy.

668
00:43:21,165 --> 00:43:23,190
Sorry about your car,
but in exchange, take mine.

669
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,564
How's that for a deal?

670
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:47,648
Well, did you sell
the bomb or not?

671
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:49,283
lt ain't about that, Taha.

672
00:43:51,228 --> 00:43:52,695
He broke out an hour ago.

673
00:43:54,498 --> 00:43:55,829
lt won't be long
before he starts...

674
00:43:55,899 --> 00:43:57,366
banging the door down.

675
00:44:01,538 --> 00:44:02,869
Hey, wake up.

676
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:05,568
Your brother's on his way
to rescue you.

677
00:44:09,513 --> 00:44:10,571
Be careful.

678
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,240
OK.

679
00:44:31,635 --> 00:44:32,897
First of all, how did you know
l was a cop?

680
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:34,062
The way you move.

681
00:44:34,138 --> 00:44:35,901
Nobody around here
moves or fights like that.

682
00:44:35,973 --> 00:44:37,167
lt looks too clean.

683
00:44:37,241 --> 00:44:38,606
When you come from the streets,
you got one thing more.

684
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:40,610
- Oh, yeah? What?
- Hate.

685
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:41,770
Right. Sorry to disappoint you.

686
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:43,540
Hate wasn't part
of my education, like you.

687
00:44:43,614 --> 00:44:46,048
They taught me liberty,
equality, fraternity.

688
00:44:46,116 --> 00:44:47,344
Water, gas, electricity.

689
00:44:47,418 --> 00:44:49,283
You don't give a shit
about laws, do you, wiseass?

690
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:51,787
Sure, l do, but l want them
to be the same for everybody.

691
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:53,948
But they are, and l'm here
to make sure that they're obeyed.

692
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:56,117
No, no, you're just a pit bull
who bites for his master.

693
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:57,922
Yeah, when laws aren't obeyed,
that's what l do.

694
00:44:59,663 --> 00:45:00,994
This is where l was born.

695
00:45:01,065 --> 00:45:02,930
lt was already
pretty bad news.

696
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,366
Then they built a wall around this
when l was 18 years old.

697
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:07,063
Did l do anything
to deserve that punishment?

698
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:09,731
No. l respected
every fucking law to the letter.

699
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:12,105
And l didn't quit school
in ninth grade to sell crack.

700
00:45:12,176 --> 00:45:14,303
lt's because they closed
the school down.

701
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:16,642
The only thing l ever did wrong
was getting born here.

702
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:19,239
And what the hell is burning
people's cars gonna change?

703
00:45:19,316 --> 00:45:21,079
You know any other way
for us to get heard?

704
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:23,085
Not immediately, no.

705
00:45:24,621 --> 00:45:26,748
Want me to tell you
what's going on...

706
00:45:26,824 --> 00:45:28,086
and why l sprung you?

707
00:45:28,158 --> 00:45:29,750
For a good cause l imagine,
am l right?

708
00:45:29,827 --> 00:45:30,759
Yeah, for a good cause.

709
00:45:30,828 --> 00:45:33,092
There's a bomb here
in this goddamn shithole of a barrio...

710
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:35,028
and if l don't defuse it
in two hours...

711
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:37,192
Barrio 1 3's population
will be zero.

712
00:45:37,267 --> 00:45:39,462
So if l--if l think
the way you do...

713
00:45:39,536 --> 00:45:41,731
l could say to myself,
''What the fuck do l care...

714
00:45:41,805 --> 00:45:42,897
''if two million losers
get snuffed?''

715
00:45:42,973 --> 00:45:44,600
But no, there's always
an asshole who's willing...

716
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:46,472
to fight for the idea
that laws are made...

717
00:45:46,543 --> 00:45:47,771
for everybody.

718
00:45:47,845 --> 00:45:49,676
And now you help me
to locate that bomb...

719
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,305
or you protect
your own precious ass...

720
00:45:51,381 --> 00:45:54,145
like all the bourgeoisie
you criticize.

721
00:45:54,218 --> 00:45:55,617
There's really
a bomb around here?

722
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,945
l don't even want to know
why it turned up here.

723
00:45:59,022 --> 00:46:01,115
- Who's got it? Taha?
- That's right.

724
00:46:01,191 --> 00:46:02,283
He's got your sister
and my bomb.

725
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:03,849
That's two good reasons
to work together.

726
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,655
lf you're lying again,
you're a dead man.

727
00:46:09,666 --> 00:46:10,826
Deal.

728
00:46:13,704 --> 00:46:15,194
So what's your plan?

729
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:17,103
Tell me exactly
what Taha's place is like.

730
00:46:17,174 --> 00:46:18,266
l'll figure out how to sneak in.

731
00:46:18,342 --> 00:46:20,003
l find the bomb,
and once it's defused...

732
00:46:20,077 --> 00:46:21,169
we go after your sister.

733
00:46:21,245 --> 00:46:22,337
Will l drink tea?

734
00:46:22,412 --> 00:46:24,277
No, you got
to create a diversion.

735
00:46:24,348 --> 00:46:26,680
Taha's gonna make you
his priority.

736
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:28,274
That way l'm sure
not to be disturbed.

737
00:46:28,352 --> 00:46:29,717
You think it'll work?

738
00:46:30,988 --> 00:46:32,922
- You got a telephone?
- Yeah.

739
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:34,252
Hand it over.

740
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:38,992
That's not Phantom Man.
lt's James Bond.

741
00:46:39,062 --> 00:46:41,030
Oh, very funny.

742
00:46:49,106 --> 00:46:50,505
Yeah.

743
00:46:52,776 --> 00:46:54,107
How'd you get my number?

744
00:46:54,178 --> 00:46:55,839
You can buy anything in jail.

745
00:46:55,913 --> 00:46:57,175
Yeah, l heard you were out.

746
00:46:57,247 --> 00:46:59,647
l'm over
at the factory opposite.

747
00:46:59,716 --> 00:47:02,184
Hey, wait.
Who are you talking to?

748
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:06,221
Well, what do you want?

749
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:09,054
Listen, l'm with a cop.
He's got a deal for you.

750
00:47:09,126 --> 00:47:11,060
l'll send K2 to get you.

751
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:15,654
What, are you out
of your fucking mind?

752
00:47:15,732 --> 00:47:17,199
The plan was to sneak in,
for Christ's sake...

753
00:47:17,267 --> 00:47:19,201
not to advertise
that we're coming.

754
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:21,134
Discreet in through
the back door...

755
00:47:21,205 --> 00:47:23,571
meaning never in their face,
playing it cooler than cool.

756
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,267
Forget your police manual.

757
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:27,640
You're in Barrio 1 3.
lt's different here...

758
00:47:27,711 --> 00:47:29,372
and l know Taha by heart.

759
00:47:29,446 --> 00:47:30,845
Trust me, it's our only chance.

760
00:47:30,914 --> 00:47:32,814
So what's your plan?
We fight his 200 goons...

761
00:47:32,883 --> 00:47:34,077
and the winner's
whoever's not dead?

762
00:47:34,151 --> 00:47:35,345
No. No one's gonna die.

763
00:47:35,419 --> 00:47:36,784
There's only one thing
that works with Taha...

764
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:38,253
and if we use it,
it will give us time.

765
00:47:38,322 --> 00:47:39,949
- What's that?
- His curiosity.

766
00:47:41,558 --> 00:47:43,025
Who's this cop
he's talking about?

767
00:47:43,093 --> 00:47:44,424
Mm-mmm.

768
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:45,722
What is this?
Whenever l ask a question...

769
00:47:45,796 --> 00:47:47,525
l get a ''Mm-mmm.''

770
00:47:47,598 --> 00:47:48,895
Hell of a vocabulary.

771
00:47:48,966 --> 00:47:50,194
OK, find out everything
about that guy.

772
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:51,495
l mean everything.

773
00:47:51,568 --> 00:47:53,798
And l want him here,
not at the morgue.

774
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:55,338
l'll be right back.

775
00:47:57,641 --> 00:47:59,905
Count me out. Too risky.

776
00:47:59,977 --> 00:48:01,239
You're dead
if you do it alone.

777
00:48:01,311 --> 00:48:02,744
l've always worked alone,
and l'm still around...

778
00:48:02,813 --> 00:48:04,838
so fuck off, Jack.

779
00:48:04,915 --> 00:48:06,712
l know Taha's place
like the back of my hand...

780
00:48:06,783 --> 00:48:08,751
all the exits, even the one l dug out myself.

781
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:10,912
Dude, l'm very happy for you.
l hope your hands didn't hurt.

782
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:12,649
l know where the bomb is!

783
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:13,985
You'll never find it
without me.

784
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:16,183
A couple of minutes ago,
you didn't even know...

785
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,386
there was a bomb.

786
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:18,826
What is this bullshit?

787
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:20,693
Taha's got a safety vault
for valuable things...

788
00:48:20,764 --> 00:48:21,924
and l know how to get in.

789
00:48:21,999 --> 00:48:23,296
How do you know
he put it in there?

790
00:48:23,367 --> 00:48:24,834
Where's he gonna put it,
in the kitchen?

791
00:48:26,503 --> 00:48:27,731
OK, here's the deal.

792
00:48:27,804 --> 00:48:30,102
l set you free, and you shut up
and do what l say, OK?

793
00:48:30,173 --> 00:48:31,640
No, l've got another deal.

794
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:33,198
You shut up,
pray my sister's alive.

795
00:48:33,277 --> 00:48:35,142
lf you behave,
l'll get your bomb.

796
00:48:35,212 --> 00:48:37,407
Now uncuff me
before we're in deep shit up to our necks.

797
00:48:41,118 --> 00:48:42,176
Deal.

798
00:48:47,224 --> 00:48:48,316
ls this guy the cop?

799
00:48:48,392 --> 00:48:50,189
Wow, what a sense
of deduction, K2. l'm impressed.

800
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,352
That's very funny.

801
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:54,261
lf Taha doesn't finish you off,
the pleasure will be all mine.

802
00:48:54,331 --> 00:48:55,628
Come on, let's go.
Follow us.

803
00:48:55,699 --> 00:48:58,065
And no bullshit.
We're the nervous kind.

804
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:14,544
Hey!

805
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:16,051
Guard duty isn't for sleeping.

806
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:17,450
Sorry, but l dozed off.

807
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:19,148
- Where is he?
- ln the back.

808
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:27,991
Did you feed him?

809
00:49:28,065 --> 00:49:29,430
He eats all the time.

810
00:49:35,005 --> 00:49:38,065
l got some work for you,
so you can stretch your legs a bit.

811
00:49:46,283 --> 00:49:48,513
They could wipe out a city
with all this shit.

812
00:49:53,423 --> 00:49:55,653
That's the van they transported
the bomb in it.

813
00:49:55,726 --> 00:49:57,193
At least we're sure it's here.

814
00:50:05,235 --> 00:50:07,169
Stay here, l'll pick you up on the way out.

815
00:50:07,237 --> 00:50:08,602
Very funny.

816
00:50:25,088 --> 00:50:26,885
Seems you got a new pal,
a fucking cop.

817
00:50:26,957 --> 00:50:28,618
He's no friend of mine.

818
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:29,886
He's the only one
that can defuse...

819
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:32,019
- the bomb you stole.
- The only one?

820
00:50:32,095 --> 00:50:34,222
When the countdown ends,
everything goes within 8 kilometers.

821
00:50:34,297 --> 00:50:35,855
And you, of course,
have come here to save us.

822
00:50:35,932 --> 00:50:37,194
There's a code
that will stop the timer.

823
00:50:37,267 --> 00:50:39,360
lt will save more than
two million people.

824
00:50:39,436 --> 00:50:40,698
The state sends us
a brave cop...

825
00:50:40,771 --> 00:50:42,204
to save us from a nasty bomb...

826
00:50:42,272 --> 00:50:44,536
that without our pal here
is gonna go boom.

827
00:50:44,608 --> 00:50:46,769
Great story.
Thanks, Superman.

828
00:50:46,843 --> 00:50:48,310
But let me be honest with you.

829
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:51,370
You see, we weren't planning
on hanging onto your bomb.

830
00:50:51,448 --> 00:50:52,437
So you want it back?

831
00:50:52,516 --> 00:50:54,074
Yeah.

832
00:50:54,151 --> 00:50:55,482
How much?

833
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:58,881
lf l don't punch in the code
within an hour...

834
00:50:58,955 --> 00:51:00,047
the bomb will explode.

835
00:51:00,123 --> 00:51:01,215
l know it will explode.
So what?

836
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:02,383
lt's no concern of mine...

837
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:03,790
as long as it's not where l live.

838
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:05,350
But if you don't want it
to blow up where you live...

839
00:51:05,429 --> 00:51:07,090
well, like they say,
you better cough up a little--

840
00:51:07,164 --> 00:51:08,859
lt'll kill millions
of innocent lives.

841
00:51:08,932 --> 00:51:10,991
Ah, but they should have
thought of that before...

842
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:13,434
when they made it,
for example, huh?

843
00:51:13,503 --> 00:51:14,629
So, how much?

844
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:21,105
A million.
Euros.

845
00:51:21,178 --> 00:51:23,806
l have a million on my right
for openers.

846
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,507
Do l hear a higher offer? K2?

847
00:51:27,651 --> 00:51:29,881
Two million. l have
a two million bid on my left.

848
00:51:29,953 --> 00:51:31,011
So, who will double that?

849
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:35,589
- Here.
- Nice kid. Four million.

850
00:51:35,659 --> 00:51:36,887
Four million.
Four million on my right.

851
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,018
How far you gonna go?

852
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:39,995
When you think our lives
aren't worth the price...

853
00:51:40,063 --> 00:51:42,293
tell me,
and l'll stop bidding.

854
00:51:45,402 --> 00:51:47,427
Ten? Ten million on my left.

855
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:49,665
Good. Now things
are getting a little lively.

856
00:51:51,007 --> 00:51:52,975
Well, Blues Brothers, ten million.

857
00:51:53,043 --> 00:51:55,273
There's only one of its kind.
You want it or not?

858
00:51:57,347 --> 00:51:59,679
Well, since you got
no more to fork up...

859
00:51:59,749 --> 00:52:00,977
ten million's the price.

860
00:52:01,051 --> 00:52:03,485
Ten million going once.

861
00:52:03,553 --> 00:52:04,781
Ten million going twice.

862
00:52:09,226 --> 00:52:11,217
- Twenty.
- Whoa.

863
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:13,558
Handsome bid--
in the eleventh hour, too.

864
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:15,924
K2? Hmm?

865
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:18,467
No, that's good.
He can have it.

866
00:52:18,535 --> 00:52:21,868
Twenty million. Wrap it up.

867
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:24,502
Twenty million
for two million victims.

868
00:52:24,574 --> 00:52:26,007
That's about ten Euros a head.

869
00:52:26,076 --> 00:52:27,634
Price of a couple of burgers.

870
00:52:29,446 --> 00:52:30,572
Cash or what?

871
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:32,911
Transfer. Forget cash.

872
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:34,917
There's not time to go
to the bank and come back.

873
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,646
The bomb will explode before.

874
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:40,747
Jamel, give him
our account number in the Bahamas.

875
00:52:46,429 --> 00:52:47,521
First let me see the bomb.

876
00:52:47,597 --> 00:52:50,361
Oh, that's funny. l was sure
you were gonna ask me that.

877
00:52:50,433 --> 00:52:51,695
Help yourself.

878
00:52:57,807 --> 00:52:59,399
Your bomb didn't have a launcher.

879
00:52:59,476 --> 00:53:01,774
lt's lucky l always keep
some equipment around here.

880
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:03,710
We found a Russian launcher.
We sort of modified it.

881
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:05,338
Your baby's ready to go.

882
00:53:05,415 --> 00:53:08,179
As for the direction l decide
to point it, l'll let you guess.

883
00:53:25,168 --> 00:53:27,568
You satisfied?
You've seen your bomb?

884
00:53:27,637 --> 00:53:30,037
Now make the transfer.

885
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:41,047
Now it's me
who's one step ahead.

886
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:52,862
Get me Kruger. lt's urgent.

887
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:42,207
8-4-7-3-5.

888
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:44,873
Zulu, Zulu, Fox, Delta, Charlie.

889
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:46,279
How much has to be transferred?

890
00:54:46,349 --> 00:54:47,873
Twenty million Euros.

891
00:54:48,918 --> 00:54:51,409
Are you sure the bomb is there?

892
00:54:51,488 --> 00:54:53,388
lt's right in front of me.

893
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:55,390
l can even read
the 48 minutes left on the screen.

894
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:58,890
Captain, we don't have
that kind of budget.

895
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:00,361
You've got to manage otherwise.

896
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:01,727
l'm sorry.

897
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:11,399
OK, l'll hold.

898
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:14,136
They're doing the transfer.

899
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:15,507
OK, thank you, Colonel.

900
00:55:16,846 --> 00:55:17,938
lt's done.

901
00:55:18,014 --> 00:55:19,504
Twenty million Euros
are in your account.

902
00:55:19,582 --> 00:55:22,073
l'll get started on the bomb.

903
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:23,813
Our deal's not quite finished.

904
00:55:23,887 --> 00:55:25,855
Jamel, call the Bahamas,
make sure the money's arrived.

905
00:55:25,922 --> 00:55:27,219
That's what l'm doing.

906
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:36,696
The bank doesn't open
for a half an hour.

907
00:55:36,766 --> 00:55:38,461
Let's hope it opens on time.

908
00:55:38,535 --> 00:55:40,560
lf you two don't mind,
go wait in the next room.

909
00:55:42,105 --> 00:55:43,902
Get over there. On your knees.

910
00:55:43,973 --> 00:55:45,600
Face the wall.
Hands behind your head.

911
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:52,046
Yoyo, watch these two
until you hear from me.

912
00:55:57,821 --> 00:55:59,118
What do we do now?

913
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:01,020
Hey, don't forget
we did what you wanted.

914
00:56:01,091 --> 00:56:03,355
lf we'd have played it cool,
we wouldn't be here.

915
00:56:03,426 --> 00:56:05,257
Yeah, and if your buddies
made the transfer...

916
00:56:05,328 --> 00:56:06,352
we'd already be out of here.

917
00:56:06,429 --> 00:56:08,090
Already dead, you mean.

918
00:56:08,164 --> 00:56:10,632
You don't suppose Taha
would've let us out of here.

919
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:12,998
We'll never know,
since your pals refused to pay up.

920
00:56:14,504 --> 00:56:17,098
Now at least you know
how much your life is worth.

921
00:56:17,173 --> 00:56:18,401
Huh! Joking.

922
00:56:18,475 --> 00:56:20,306
To them, l'm not worth anything at all.

923
00:56:25,949 --> 00:56:27,712
Damien.

924
00:56:27,784 --> 00:56:29,217
There's something not right
about this whole thing.

925
00:56:29,285 --> 00:56:30,377
What do you mean?

926
00:56:30,453 --> 00:56:32,478
Something, l don't know what.

927
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:34,750
They lose a bomb
like we lose our keys.

928
00:56:34,824 --> 00:56:36,451
They want to get it back,
but they don't want to pay.

929
00:56:36,526 --> 00:56:37,618
Look, when it comes
to blackmail...

930
00:56:37,694 --> 00:56:38,752
they're very particular.

931
00:56:38,828 --> 00:56:41,194
Hey, Supercop,
why are you defending them?

932
00:56:41,264 --> 00:56:42,697
l'm not, but there are values...

933
00:56:42,766 --> 00:56:44,631
real values.

934
00:56:44,701 --> 00:56:46,999
The same ones l thought
you defended, too.

935
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:05,577
How much time we got?

936
00:57:10,693 --> 00:57:13,025
37 minutes.

937
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:14,290
Wouldn't hurt
to have an idea.

938
00:57:14,364 --> 00:57:16,389
Yeah, it wouldn't hurt.

939
00:57:16,466 --> 00:57:19,026
Well, l think l've got one.

940
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:21,400
Well?

941
00:57:21,471 --> 00:57:23,166
Remember the tunnel
l told you about?

942
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:24,331
The one that you dug out
with your teeth?

943
00:57:24,407 --> 00:57:25,999
That's right.

944
00:57:26,075 --> 00:57:27,269
lt starts in the toilet...

945
00:57:27,343 --> 00:57:28,435
it's a left at the elevator.

946
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:34,511
And Yoyo, of course,
is going to let us piss together.

947
00:57:34,584 --> 00:57:35,676
No, but if you think
of a good reason...

948
00:57:35,752 --> 00:57:37,014
to go and see Taha...

949
00:57:37,086 --> 00:57:38,553
he'll take us to the elevator.

950
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:41,355
OK.

951
00:57:41,424 --> 00:57:43,119
And once we're at the elevator?

952
00:57:43,193 --> 00:57:44,285
We improvise.

953
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:45,793
l've heard better plans, you know.

954
00:57:45,862 --> 00:57:47,159
Got another one?

955
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:48,322
No.

956
00:57:48,398 --> 00:57:50,127
Then move it.

957
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:53,326
Get down right now.

958
00:57:53,403 --> 00:57:54,995
We gotta see Taha.
lt's mega-urgent.

959
00:57:55,071 --> 00:57:56,163
lt is, huh?

960
00:57:56,239 --> 00:57:57,934
Well, for now you're going
to mega-get down...

961
00:57:58,007 --> 00:57:59,531
and mega-keep your mouth shut...

962
00:57:59,609 --> 00:58:00,667
got that?

963
00:58:00,743 --> 00:58:01,835
You must be a mega-dickhead.

964
00:58:01,911 --> 00:58:03,811
- What's your name again?
- What the fuck do you care?

965
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:04,972
lt's for Taha.

966
00:58:05,048 --> 00:58:06,140
When he asks whose fault it was...

967
00:58:06,216 --> 00:58:07,740
that he lost
twenty million Euros...

968
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:09,250
l don't want to get
the name wrong.

969
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:11,378
Listen, if you're fucking with me...

970
00:58:11,454 --> 00:58:12,751
we're going to have to snuff you.

971
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:14,153
Deal.

972
00:58:14,224 --> 00:58:15,316
You three, come with me.

973
00:58:15,391 --> 00:58:16,858
The rest of you, cover us.

974
00:58:19,362 --> 00:58:20,659
l wish l knew what we were doing.

975
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:22,425
Stay loose
and just let it happen.

976
00:58:33,576 --> 00:58:34,508
Get ready to go.

977
00:58:34,577 --> 00:58:35,669
- Hey?
- Now!

978
00:59:01,604 --> 00:59:02,571
lt's down there!

979
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:04,607
That's the way out?
Through there? Great!

980
00:59:15,685 --> 00:59:17,516
Jesus!
You should have been a cop!

981
00:59:17,587 --> 00:59:18,781
- They'd have loved you!
- Follow me!

982
00:59:22,792 --> 00:59:25,022
What's going on down there?!
What's happening?

983
00:59:25,094 --> 00:59:26,686
Why don't you answer
when l call you?

984
00:59:26,763 --> 00:59:28,424
Uh, we were in a tunnel.

985
00:59:28,498 --> 00:59:30,261
l would like to know what the fuck
you're talking about!

986
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:32,528
Well, it was because
of those two assholes...

987
00:59:32,602 --> 00:59:33,728
that got away through the tunnel.

988
00:59:33,803 --> 00:59:35,065
We tried to catch up
with them...

989
00:59:35,138 --> 00:59:36,605
- but then the walkie-talkies--
- Hold on a second.

990
00:59:36,673 --> 00:59:37,833
Repeat that once more.

991
00:59:50,219 --> 00:59:53,313
Jamel!
What about the transfer?

992
00:59:58,261 --> 00:59:59,489
We got problems, Taha.

993
00:59:59,562 --> 01:00:01,291
- He was bluffing.
- Yeah.

994
01:00:01,364 --> 01:00:02,592
You know,
l should have known!

995
01:00:02,665 --> 01:00:04,599
You can't trust a cop never...

996
01:00:04,667 --> 01:00:06,396
even with a gun to his head.

997
01:00:06,469 --> 01:00:08,699
But he'll pay for this, the bastard!

998
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:10,033
l'm going to detonate the bomb!

999
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:12,472
Taha--Taha,
l think you had better sit down.

1000
01:00:16,412 --> 01:00:18,004
They used the Bahamas
account number to move in...

1001
01:00:18,081 --> 01:00:20,049
on all of the numbered
bank accounts, and...

1002
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:21,947
they cleaned them all out.

1003
01:00:22,018 --> 01:00:23,144
What's our...

1004
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:26,388
Bahamas, Riyadh, Karachi...

1005
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:27,548
all of them, even London.

1006
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:29,524
- Nothing. Zero.
- What?

1007
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:33,887
But how's that possible?

1008
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:36,397
lf l ever learn that,
l'll be the king of the world.

1009
01:00:38,434 --> 01:00:39,401
ln the meantime...

1010
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:40,663
this dumb little accountant...

1011
01:00:40,737 --> 01:00:42,500
is going back home.

1012
01:00:47,276 --> 01:00:49,005
Excuse me.

1013
01:00:57,086 --> 01:00:58,417
Hey, Taha, if you're broke...

1014
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:00,012
then how the fuck
are you going to pay us this week?

1015
01:01:13,036 --> 01:01:14,765
l got cash in the safe
downstairs.

1016
01:01:14,837 --> 01:01:16,202
No one's about
to rip that off.

1017
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:18,864
K2, your piece.
Hand it over.

1018
01:01:23,746 --> 01:01:24,838
K2, give it to me, huh?

1019
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:41,023
You are a bunch
of fucking shitheads.

1020
01:02:06,456 --> 01:02:08,048
What do we do now, K2?

1021
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:20,703
OK, move out, everyone.

1022
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:23,425
We better separate!

1023
01:04:56,759 --> 01:04:58,056
Out of the way! Move!

1024
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:02,324
Police!

1025
01:05:48,144 --> 01:05:50,339
How long
before this bomb goes off?

1026
01:05:50,413 --> 01:05:51,505
Ten minutes.

1027
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:53,104
And you're sure
you can defuse it.

1028
01:05:53,182 --> 01:05:54,615
Yeah. What's more,
l'm the only one.

1029
01:05:58,287 --> 01:05:59,652
No, l need him
to come with me.

1030
01:05:59,722 --> 01:06:00,780
No can do.

1031
01:06:03,059 --> 01:06:04,390
and you defuse the bomb.
How's that?

1032
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:06,121
You better go.
You've only got nine minutes.

1033
01:06:10,099 --> 01:06:11,657
OK, you both go.

1034
01:06:11,734 --> 01:06:13,031
l'll wait for you down below.

1035
01:06:13,102 --> 01:06:14,865
You gotta come down
sooner or later, huh?

1036
01:06:14,937 --> 01:06:15,904
lf l do the job,
l bet even you...

1037
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:17,303
will be glad to see a cop's face.

1038
01:06:17,373 --> 01:06:18,431
Hmm.

1039
01:06:48,137 --> 01:06:50,264
What the hell is that?

1040
01:06:50,339 --> 01:06:51,465
A present from Taha.

1041
01:06:53,142 --> 01:06:54,769
Let me handle this.
l love presents.

1042
01:07:46,195 --> 01:07:47,560
Hey, Mongo! You ready now...

1043
01:07:47,630 --> 01:07:48,858
for me to teach you
a thing or two?

1044
01:08:26,669 --> 01:08:28,296
Hey! He's all yours.

1045
01:08:41,283 --> 01:08:43,717
Nice going!
Where did you learn that?

1046
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:44,946
ln a cookbook or official manual...

1047
01:08:45,021 --> 01:08:46,249
l don't remember.

1048
01:09:13,716 --> 01:09:16,048
lt's all over, Lola, lt's all over.

1049
01:09:18,721 --> 01:09:20,689
No, sorry,
but it's far from over.

1050
01:09:24,126 --> 01:09:25,593
Fuck it,
l can't get through.

1051
01:09:29,398 --> 01:09:31,229
OK, got it.

1052
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:32,790
Don't worry.
He's an expert at the cuffs.

1053
01:09:32,868 --> 01:09:33,994
He'll get them off you.

1054
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:39,298
- Hello?
- Captain Tomaso.

1055
01:09:39,375 --> 01:09:41,070
l've got the bomb in front of me.
l need the code.

1056
01:09:41,143 --> 01:09:42,269
Where are you now?

1057
01:09:42,344 --> 01:09:44,107
The bomb's in front of me
with 3 1/2 minutes left.

1058
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:45,511
Give me the code,
and we'll talk later.

1059
01:09:45,581 --> 01:09:46,775
Where are you? The exact spot.

1060
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:49,409
On the roof of a building
in Barrio 1 3.

1061
01:09:49,485 --> 01:09:50,611
Do you want
the weather forecast as well?!

1062
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:52,950
Good work, Tomaso.
We're all very proud of you.

1063
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:54,284
Thanks, but time's running out.

1064
01:09:54,356 --> 01:09:56,586
9-2-9-3...

1065
01:09:56,659 --> 01:09:58,058
9-2-9-3...

1066
01:09:58,127 --> 01:10:00,493
3-7-0-9-B-1 3.

1067
01:10:00,563 --> 01:10:01,791
7-0-9-B-1 3.

1068
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:03,491
l'll call you back
if l'm still alive.

1069
01:10:11,841 --> 01:10:13,775
B-1 3? Like Barrio 1 3?

1070
01:10:13,843 --> 01:10:15,538
- Yeah.
- Doesn't it seem strange...

1071
01:10:15,611 --> 01:10:17,010
that the bomb's code is Barrio 1 3...

1072
01:10:17,079 --> 01:10:19,240
92, 93, the two zones we're in?

1073
01:10:19,315 --> 01:10:21,613
Just coincidence.

1074
01:10:21,684 --> 01:10:23,117
Damien, wait! Hold on.

1075
01:10:23,185 --> 01:10:24,277
lf the bomb wasn't scheduled
to come here...

1076
01:10:24,353 --> 01:10:26,014
why the hell does it have
the same number as this barrio?

1077
01:10:26,088 --> 01:10:28,784
Look, whatever it is,
l've got to stop it, OK?

1078
01:10:28,858 --> 01:10:30,450
Damien, listen.
What if it's the reverse?

1079
01:10:30,526 --> 01:10:31,458
The reverse of what?

1080
01:10:31,527 --> 01:10:33,461
You detonate the bomb
with the code instead.

1081
01:10:33,529 --> 01:10:35,156
Why send me, then,
if they wanted the fucking thing...

1082
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:37,028
to explode in the first place?
Explain that!

1083
01:10:37,099 --> 01:10:38,566
So it blows up right here
where they want...

1084
01:10:38,634 --> 01:10:39,931
the center of Barrio 1 3.

1085
01:10:40,002 --> 01:10:41,196
''Give me the exact spot.''

1086
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:42,999
Wasn't that what
your boss asked?

1087
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:44,733
Yeah, but that's
a security measure!

1088
01:10:44,807 --> 01:10:46,001
lt's a trap, Damien,
l'm sure!

1089
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:47,667
Get off my back
and let me work!

1090
01:10:54,717 --> 01:10:56,309
l've already saved your life once,
so trust me!

1091
01:10:56,385 --> 01:10:58,649
l'm a soldier!
l've got a mission to do!

1092
01:11:44,533 --> 01:11:45,591
ln one minute,
we're all going to--

1093
01:11:45,668 --> 01:11:46,726
Open your eyes, Damien!

1094
01:11:46,802 --> 01:11:48,235
Nobody gives a shit
about this barrio.

1095
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:49,896
Twenty years, and they can't
solve the problem.

1096
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:51,064
They built a wall around us...

1097
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:52,869
now they're going
to clean it out for good.

1098
01:11:52,942 --> 01:11:54,409
How come there are
no civil servants here?

1099
01:11:54,476 --> 01:11:56,376
No post office or schools,
and just by chance...

1100
01:11:56,445 --> 01:11:57,776
the police station
was shut down.

1101
01:11:59,782 --> 01:12:01,841
Oh, yeah, the bomb was attacked
by some bad guys, right?

1102
01:12:01,917 --> 01:12:03,817
Yeah.

1103
01:12:03,886 --> 01:12:04,875
That's the story
they told you, huh?

1104
01:12:04,954 --> 01:12:06,046
- Yeah.
- Then tell me why...

1105
01:12:06,121 --> 01:12:07,986
just before we saw the van,
it was intact.

1106
01:12:08,057 --> 01:12:09,354
Where were the signs
of an explosion...

1107
01:12:09,425 --> 01:12:10,915
of a smashed-in door?

1108
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:11,960
Maybe it was a different one.

1109
01:12:12,027 --> 01:12:13,551
lt was the same,
and you know damn well.

1110
01:12:13,629 --> 01:12:14,721
And once they were sure...

1111
01:12:14,797 --> 01:12:16,264
the bomb was on
the inside of Barrio 1 3...

1112
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:17,731
and that it wasn't
going anywhere...

1113
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:19,563
they got their best pit bull
to set it in motion.

1114
01:12:19,635 --> 01:12:21,262
And you really accomplished that mission.

1115
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:22,395
You stopped Taha
from dumping it...

1116
01:12:22,471 --> 01:12:23,563
so it's all for us.

1117
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:47,325
You don't kill
two million people...

1118
01:12:47,396 --> 01:12:48,454
'cause you can't
solve their problems!

1119
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:49,622
No? They murdered six million...

1120
01:12:49,698 --> 01:12:51,666
because none of them
were blond with blue eyes!

1121
01:13:25,901 --> 01:13:27,300
Sorry.

1122
01:13:27,369 --> 01:13:28,393
Get off me!

1123
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:30,529
l prefer dying for my brother's dumb ideas
than for yours.

1124
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:03,401
lt's over?

1125
01:14:03,472 --> 01:14:05,201
This time it really is over.

1126
01:14:10,179 --> 01:14:11,942
lt's not over.

1127
01:14:28,831 --> 01:14:30,560
l told you that even you...

1128
01:14:30,632 --> 01:14:31,860
would be glad to see my face.

1129
01:14:33,102 --> 01:14:34,592
You got five minutes
to leave here.

1130
01:14:34,670 --> 01:14:36,638
Can l take a souvenir?

1131
01:14:37,906 --> 01:14:39,464
Yeah, be my guest.

1132
01:14:48,450 --> 01:14:50,918
Uh-huh.

1133
01:14:52,421 --> 01:14:54,218
Thank you. Nothing yet.

1134
01:14:54,289 --> 01:14:56,655
Jesus Christ, it's well over an hour
that we've been waiting.

1135
01:14:56,725 --> 01:14:58,056
And if by tonight nothing happens,
then what?

1136
01:14:58,127 --> 01:14:59,526
l've no idea, Corsini.
For Christ's sake...

1137
01:14:59,595 --> 01:15:01,927
it's supposed to explode
and that's that.

1138
01:15:01,997 --> 01:15:03,089
What's going on?

1139
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:04,393
Sounds like a fight.

1140
01:15:04,466 --> 01:15:05,433
Go and have a look!

1141
01:15:19,481 --> 01:15:20,778
There.
Mission accomplished.

1142
01:15:20,849 --> 01:15:22,840
Well, not quite.
At the last minute...

1143
01:15:22,918 --> 01:15:24,476
we couldn't remember the code.

1144
01:15:24,553 --> 01:15:25,918
- But we both tried, didn't we?
- Mm-hmm.

1145
01:15:25,988 --> 01:15:27,080
But it's my fault, totally.

1146
01:15:27,156 --> 01:15:28,555
lt was me
who forgot the numbers.

1147
01:15:28,624 --> 01:15:30,285
- You remember yours, right?
- Oh, yeah.

1148
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:31,451
Hey, he's incredible.

1149
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:33,688
We made an absolutely
fantastic team, you know?

1150
01:15:35,864 --> 01:15:37,354
OK, let's have it.

1151
01:15:37,433 --> 01:15:40,493
92, 93.

1152
01:15:40,569 --> 01:15:42,696
- Wow, like the two zone numbers.
- Yeah.

1153
01:15:42,771 --> 01:15:44,329
That's wild, eh?

1154
01:15:44,406 --> 01:15:46,203
A coincidence.

1155
01:15:46,275 --> 01:15:47,503
Now, we got 7-0-9.

1156
01:15:47,576 --> 01:15:49,601
Easy to remember,
that's today's date.

1157
01:15:49,678 --> 01:15:52,909
7-0-9. September 7...

1158
01:15:52,981 --> 01:15:54,312
end of the summer holidays.

1159
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:55,975
Practical, eh?
A bomb explodes on the day...

1160
01:15:56,051 --> 01:15:57,712
you know everyone's
around for sure...

1161
01:15:57,786 --> 01:16:00,220
and you get rid of
all the scum in one shot.

1162
01:16:00,289 --> 01:16:01,688
lf l'm mistaken, please stop me.

1163
01:16:01,757 --> 01:16:04,783
Now then, the code.

1164
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:07,385
l think that l've got the rest of it.

1165
01:16:07,463 --> 01:16:10,660
B1 3. Like Barrio 1 3.

1166
01:16:10,732 --> 01:16:13,667
How could l forget?

1167
01:16:13,735 --> 01:16:14,997
Why don't l give you
the honor of finishing?

1168
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:17,334
Are you telling me you plan
on blowing up this bomb here in Paris?!

1169
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:19,840
l'm sorry, but l thought the code was
to defuse the bomb.

1170
01:16:19,908 --> 01:16:21,808
You mean that if l punch it in,
it'll do the opposite--

1171
01:16:21,877 --> 01:16:24,038
Stop playing the fool, Tomaso!
You know perfectly well!

1172
01:16:24,112 --> 01:16:25,841
No, l don't. Explain it to me.
l want to know why--

1173
01:16:25,914 --> 01:16:28,041
Barrio 1 3 is uncontrollable.
lt costs a fortune to the state.

1174
01:16:28,116 --> 01:16:29,174
The taxpayers are worried.

1175
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:31,811
Worried, frightened, and fed up
with paying for such scum!

1176
01:16:31,887 --> 01:16:33,650
So we clean it out with a bomb?

1177
01:16:33,722 --> 01:16:36,350
Yes. lt's not very democratic,
but it solves all the problems.

1178
01:16:36,425 --> 01:16:38,325
Except one. Yours, sir.

1179
01:16:39,628 --> 01:16:40,652
No, l beg of you! Please!

1180
01:16:40,729 --> 01:16:41,821
Look, why don't we clean up everything?

1181
01:16:41,897 --> 01:16:42,989
Do you want us all killed?!

1182
01:16:43,065 --> 01:16:45,590
You should have thought
of that when you built it!

1183
01:16:45,667 --> 01:16:47,362
No!

1184
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:02,076
You really thought l was going
to go through with it.

1185
01:17:02,150 --> 01:17:03,674
Why? For revenge?

1186
01:17:03,752 --> 01:17:06,880
No, you don't always need
violence to solve problems.

1187
01:17:06,955 --> 01:17:08,684
There are
more democratic ways.

1188
01:17:10,058 --> 01:17:11,923
Look out of the window,
and smile.

1189
01:17:14,930 --> 01:17:16,420
Was the sound OK?

1190
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:19,931
What are you plotting, Tomaso?

1191
01:17:20,002 --> 01:17:22,562
l'm doing my job, sir.
You know what my job is?

1192
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:25,334
l see that laws are obeyed.
Obeyed by everyone.

1193
01:17:25,407 --> 01:17:26,874
l make sure
that no one forgets that.

1194
01:17:26,942 --> 01:17:28,739
That's my job--
no more, no less.

1195
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:32,143
Now, if you still
don't understand...

1196
01:17:32,214 --> 01:17:34,045
you can see it all on network TV.

1197
01:17:34,116 --> 01:17:36,050
As well as internet reservations.

1198
01:17:36,118 --> 01:17:37,244
You can also purchase
your ticket...

1199
01:17:37,319 --> 01:17:40,049
on the train from a conductor.

1200
01:17:40,122 --> 01:17:42,716
No tickets are as yet available
at ticket windows

1201
01:17:42,791 --> 01:17:44,884
and this may continue for some time.

1202
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:47,394
For rail companies,
it's impossible to estimate...

1203
01:17:47,462 --> 01:17:49,760
when the computer breakdown
will be repaired.

1204
01:17:49,831 --> 01:17:52,698
As you know,
it has now been twenty-four hours--

1205
01:17:52,768 --> 01:17:55,066
Barrio 1 3 is uncontrollable.
lt costs a fortune to the state.

1206
01:17:55,137 --> 01:17:57,162
The taxpayers are worried.
Worried, frightened...

1207
01:17:57,239 --> 01:17:58,797
and fed up with paying
for such scum!

1208
01:17:58,874 --> 01:18:01,399
So we clean it out
with a bomb?

1209
01:18:01,476 --> 01:18:04,001
Yes. lt's not very democratic,
but it solves all the problems.

1210
01:18:04,079 --> 01:18:06,707
Barrio 1 3 is uncontrollable.
lt costs a fortune to the state.

1211
01:18:06,782 --> 01:18:08,875
The taxpayers are worried.
Worried, frightened...

1212
01:18:08,951 --> 01:18:11,078
and fed up with paying
for such scum!

1213
01:18:11,153 --> 01:18:13,121
So we clean it out
with a bomb?

1214
01:18:13,188 --> 01:18:16,089
Yes. lt's not very democratic,
but it solves all the problems.

1215
01:18:16,158 --> 01:18:18,285
Except one. Yours, sir.

1216
01:18:41,783 --> 01:18:43,648
You sure you don't want
to stay on this side?

1217
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:45,186
With the reward
you're going to get...

1218
01:18:45,253 --> 01:18:46,777
you could buy a real nice place.

1219
01:18:46,855 --> 01:18:48,322
l got a nice place.

1220
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:49,880
Besides, this is where l live.

1221
01:18:49,958 --> 01:18:51,482
l was born here.

1222
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:53,460
Now all l want to do
is live here in peace.

1223
01:18:55,364 --> 01:18:57,423
demolishing the wall
next week.

1224
01:18:57,499 --> 01:18:58,591
The police, the post office...

1225
01:18:58,667 --> 01:19:01,295
and the school
all open next month.

1226
01:19:01,370 --> 01:19:04,032
You know
it's down to you, all of that.

1227
01:19:04,106 --> 01:19:06,040
Older brother,
you're the greatest!

1228
01:19:06,108 --> 01:19:07,473
l've been saying that for years!

1229
01:19:07,542 --> 01:19:11,171
Come on, smile.
Lighten up.

1230
01:19:11,246 --> 01:19:12,873
l hope things don't get
messed up on the way...

1231
01:19:12,948 --> 01:19:14,176
and that they keep their promises.

1232
01:19:14,249 --> 01:19:15,307
Hey, these things aren't words.

1233
01:19:15,384 --> 01:19:17,011
They were voted on.

1234
01:19:17,085 --> 01:19:18,416
And government decrees
have to be applied.

1235
01:19:18,487 --> 01:19:19,579
lt's the law.

1236
01:19:19,655 --> 01:19:21,020
And there's always
an asshole like me around...

1237
01:19:21,089 --> 01:19:22,579
to see that laws are obeyed.

1238
01:19:25,761 --> 01:19:26,750
Take care of yourself.

1239
01:19:26,828 --> 01:19:29,160
You make it sound as if
l live in the barrio like you.

1240
01:19:29,231 --> 01:19:31,722
Your neighborhood's
more dangerous than mine.

1241
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:33,358
l'm not so sure.

1242
01:19:36,538 --> 01:19:37,664
Come and see us?

1243
01:19:37,739 --> 01:19:40,867
l can't promise.

1244
01:19:48,016 --> 01:19:49,210
He'll come, yeah.

1245
01:19:54,022 --> 01:19:55,319
Hello.

1246
01:19:56,692 --> 01:19:57,989
Thank you.

1247
01:20:01,496 --> 01:20:02,622
Go on.

1248
01:20:02,023 --> 01:20:09,323
