Jay was gonna take her away from me.

- That you were a slut.

- Who's the father?
- I thought it didn't matter.

We can't tell her it's not me.

She adores you. It would break her heart.

Be careful. Easy.

170
00:10:24,066 --> 00:10:26,676
- All right.
- You have to help us.

171
00:10:26,711 --> 00:10:27,903
They're gonna kill us.

172
00:10:27,969 --> 00:10:30,472
Come on.

173
00:10:30,539 --> 00:10:32,908
EVE: Connor?

174
00:10:32,974 --> 00:10:34,910
Connor?

175
00:10:41,983 --> 00:10:48,357
The boy can go, but you
two need to come with us.

176

[suspenseful music]

177
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,955
Where are we going?

178
00:10:56,795 --> 00:10:58,229
I found him.

179
00:10:59,633 --> 00:11:02,403
Mrs. Raven?

180
00:11:02,469 --> 00:11:05,673
He's so soft.

181
00:11:10,978 --> 00:11:13,948
Dad, we have to go back for Eve and Alex.

182
00:11:13,983 --> 00:11:16,570
- They're gonna kill them.
- He's so beautiful.

183
00:11:16,605 --> 00:11:18,786
Nature can be so cruel.

184
00:11:20,921 --> 00:11:23,624
Dad?

185
00:11:23,691 --> 00:11:26,193
We can't leave them behind.

186
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,395
We have to.

187
00:11:28,462 --> 00:11:30,364
You'll understand.

188
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:32,533
Understand what?

189
00:11:32,599 --> 00:11:34,902
Just trust me.

190
00:11:34,969 --> 00:11:36,737
Come, Benedict.

191
00:11:41,842 --> 00:11:43,978
Where are we going?

192
00:11:46,113 --> 00:11:47,581
It's okay, son.

193
00:11:47,648 --> 00:11:51,085
Everything is going to be okay now.

194
00:11:51,151 --> 00:11:52,619
Come.

195
00:12:05,032 --> 00:12:07,001
Do you know what's happening out there?

196
00:12:07,067 --> 00:12:09,136
It's the Black Spring.

197
00:12:09,203 --> 00:12:11,672
Black Spring? What's that?

198
00:12:11,739 --> 00:12:14,241
I'll show you.

199
00:12:14,308 --> 00:12:15,609
Show me what?

200
00:12:15,676 --> 00:12:17,287
How to survive it.

201
00:12:17,342 --> 00:12:19,728
We should go back, get Eve and Alex.

202
00:12:19,775 --> 00:12:22,883
Dad, we should help them.

203
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:24,623
We can't.

204
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:26,086
Why?

205
00:12:26,153 --> 00:12:27,988
CONNOR: We just can't.

206
00:12:28,055 --> 00:12:30,324
You're gonna have to trust me.

207
00:12:30,391 --> 00:12:33,594
Do you trust me?

208
00:12:35,663 --> 00:12:38,299
Yeah, of course.

209
00:12:38,365 --> 00:12:40,367
I love you.

210
00:12:40,434 --> 00:12:42,102
You know that?

211
00:12:44,605 --> 00:12:45,973
Yeah.

212
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,275
And I am so proud of you.

You are the best thing
that ever happened to me.

Dad, what's going on?

215
00:12:54,181 --> 00:12:56,050
You need to come here now.

216
00:12:56,116 --> 00:12:58,319
You trust me, right?

217
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:04,826
What are we doing?

218
00:13:08,462 --> 00:13:11,865
I, um, I can't explain it.

219
00:13:11,932 --> 00:13:14,234
It'll sound weird.

220
00:13:14,301 --> 00:13:17,071
You just have to trust me.

221
00:13:17,137 --> 00:13:19,173
You're very brave.

222
00:13:19,239 --> 00:13:21,208
Dad?

223
00:13:25,913 --> 00:13:28,148
I'm sorry.

224
00:13:28,215 --> 00:13:30,250
I am so sorry.

225
00:13:30,317 --> 00:13:32,553
I made you.

226
00:13:32,619 --> 00:13:35,316
What? What are you talking about?

227
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:37,925
It's not your fault.

228
00:13:37,992 --> 00:13:40,094
It's not your fault. It's not your fault.

229
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,762
What's she doing?

230
00:13:41,895 --> 00:13:44,164
No. Dad, no.

231
00:13:44,231 --> 00:13:48,669
No! No, Dad.

232
00:13:48,736 --> 00:13:50,537

00:13:50,604 --> 00:13:52,206
Dad, let me in!

Dad, what are you doing?

00:13:57,311 --> 00:13:59,377
I'm your son! What are you doing?

Let me in!

It's still there.

239
00:14:37,685 --> 00:14:39,453
It will disappear.

240
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,423
He may still be alive.

241
00:14:42,489 --> 00:14:44,625
It may not have taken him yet.

242
00:14:44,692 --> 00:14:46,894
Come.

244

Losing someone you love
can be so beautiful.

I'm so proud of you.

It'll be over soon.

It will all be over.

- KYLE: We have to.

We're just making sure

253
00:15:58,136 --> 00:16:00,170
this is a safe space for everyone to be

254
00:16:00,205 --> 00:16:02,883
- while we wait this out.
- You're insane.

We haven't hurt anyone.

256

We kept to ourselves.

- Tell that to Shelley.
- I didn't do anything.

258
00:16:08,954 --> 00:16:10,796
- I saw you.
- That's a lie.

259
00:16:10,859 --> 00:16:12,113
And how do we trust you?

260
00:16:12,175 --> 00:16:14,848
Shelley saw you making out with
the boy you accused of rape.

261
00:16:14,882 --> 00:16:16,818
- Maybe she didn't...
- What?

262
00:16:16,853 --> 00:16:18,062
Maybe she didn't what?

263
00:16:18,097 --> 00:16:19,353
Didn't mean it?

264
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:23,622
Is that why you lied about
surviving in the mist?

265
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:26,060
You know what? Maybe Shelley was right.

266
00:16:26,126 --> 00:16:29,632
Maybe you are a part of it.
That's why you killed her.

267
00:16:29,687 --> 00:16:30,722
We don't have to stand for this.

268
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:32,561
- We're not your prisoners.
- Stop.

269
00:16:32,596 --> 00:16:35,269
I have fought too many assholes like you

270
00:16:35,336 --> 00:16:38,041
to give up that power freely. Come on.

271
00:16:38,104 --> 00:16:40,074
- Aah!
- Oh! Oh!

272
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:46,947
We have the right to defend ourselves.

273
00:16:49,183 --> 00:16:51,552
Anybody else disagree?

274
00:16:53,287 --> 00:16:56,390
Yeah, I thought so.

How could you do it?

277

How could you do that to her?

00:17:40,401 --> 00:17:42,827
Uh! No!

00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:43,871

No.

I know where they are.

I know where they're keeping Eve and Alex.

286
00:18:06,593 --> 00:18:08,462
We need to go.

287
00:18:08,529 --> 00:18:10,527
I can't.

288
00:18:10,597 --> 00:18:12,032
Sir, we have to.

- I can't leave my friends.
- What friends?

290
00:18:15,102 --> 00:18:18,172
The people I met who helped me get here.

291
00:18:18,238 --> 00:18:19,448
None of that matters now.

292
00:18:19,503 --> 00:18:20,874
It matters to me.

293
00:18:20,941 --> 00:18:23,490
These are people you've
known for five days.

294
00:18:23,563 --> 00:18:25,391
I've known you for eight years.

295

You have no idea, do you?

296
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,686
You have no idea who you are.

297
00:18:35,089 --> 00:18:37,746
Don't you want to know who you are?

298
00:18:37,824 --> 00:18:39,293
- Tell me.
- Come with me.

299
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,894
- I need to bring them.
- You can't.

300
00:18:40,961 --> 00:18:42,563
They can never know. You understand?

301
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:45,165
If you care for them, they can never know.

302
00:18:45,232 --> 00:18:47,534
Jonah?

303
00:18:47,601 --> 00:18:49,570
Where have you been?

304

I, um...

Who's this?

306
00:18:54,942 --> 00:18:57,177
I'm a friend of Jonah's.

Kevin's here.

309
00:19:10,591 --> 00:19:14,428
He's alive and he needs our help.

310
00:19:14,495 --> 00:19:16,336
Wow, um...

311
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:18,065
WES: Jonah.

JONAH: This guy can help
me find out who I am.

313
00:19:22,136 --> 00:19:23,737
I need to go.

314
00:19:23,837 --> 00:19:25,324
Wait. Go where?

315
00:19:25,402 --> 00:19:27,839
I'm sorry.

00:19:27,841 --> 00:19:31,597
What do you mean? Jonah, go where?

317
00:19:31,632 --> 00:19:32,880
I have to go with him.

318
00:19:32,946 --> 00:19:35,616
What the fuck are you talking about?

319
00:19:35,683 --> 00:19:36,848
You have to go.

320
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:38,523
Please.

321
00:19:39,853 --> 00:19:42,643
But we... Let's just help him.

322
00:19:42,678 --> 00:19:44,258
Then we can all go together.

323
00:19:44,325 --> 00:19:46,193
I'm afraid that's not possible.

324

- JONAH: I'll find you.
- Jonah, please.

00:19:50,431 --> 00:19:52,533
We have to go, sir.

Please.

Don't leave me.

I'm sorry.

329
00:20:20,561 --> 00:20:23,130
She didn't do anything.

330
00:20:23,197 --> 00:20:24,996
Meaning you have?

331
00:20:25,031 --> 00:20:26,066
No.

332
00:20:26,133 --> 00:20:27,635
You killed her.

333
00:20:27,701 --> 00:20:29,057
Part of your rules as well?

334
00:20:29,092 --> 00:20:30,838
She was going to break the rules,

335
00:20:30,904 --> 00:20:32,382
and the rules are clear.

336
00:20:32,453 --> 00:20:34,174
Whoever endangers the group
