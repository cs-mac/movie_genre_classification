1
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,169
- Aren't you tired?
- No. There's so much of it.

2
00:01:43,252 --> 00:01:46,502
- D'you think we'll live here all the time, Pop?
- Want to?

3
00:01:46,586 --> 00:01:50,087
Sure. I like it.
Why did we always live in California?

4
00:01:50,171 --> 00:01:54,046
Well, I was born there, got married there.
Just went on living there.

5
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:57,131
- Did Mother come with you to New York?
- No.

6
00:01:57,214 --> 00:01:59,757
I was here by myself once for three days.

7
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:06,551
- Do you still think of her, Tommy?
- Sort of. Not all the time. Just sometimes.

8
00:02:06,634 --> 00:02:10,386
- How old was I when she died, Pop?
- You were four years old.

9
00:02:11,094 --> 00:02:13,679
- A long time.
- Yeah.

10
00:02:13,761 --> 00:02:17,095
- You ever gonna get married again?
- Oh, maybe.

11
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:21,264
- You want me to?
- I don't care. I like it fine this way.

12
00:02:21,347 --> 00:02:25,891
But Grandma says you're getting tougher
and tougher to have around the house.

13
00:02:25,974 --> 00:02:28,932
She does, does she?
Any more complaints from Grandma?

14
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:31,517
She says you're too picky and choosy.

15
00:02:33,185 --> 00:02:36,186
- Where are we going?
- To meet Grandma at Saks.

16
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,314
Hey, Pop, look at that!

17
00:02:52,983 --> 00:02:55,941
- What's he supposed to be doing?
- That's Atlas.

18
00:02:56,025 --> 00:02:59,568
- He's carrying the world on his shoulders.
- No kidding!

19
00:02:59,651 --> 00:03:03,487
That's what Grandma says you're doing.
She wishes you'd leave it alone.

20
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:07,321
Oh, yeah? Looks like
I'm gonna have to slug Grandma.

21
00:03:08,572 --> 00:03:11,822
Hey, we're late.
Grandma's gonna slug us. Come on.

22
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:25,743
I just love waiting for people. There's nothing
more fun than waiting for people who are late.

23
00:03:25,826 --> 00:03:29,078
We're late, Ma, because
I'm carrying the world on my shoulders.

24
00:03:29,161 --> 00:03:31,204
It's heavy. You can't walk too fast.

25
00:03:31,287 --> 00:03:34,080
Put it down and give me money
for your son's shoes.

26
00:03:34,163 --> 00:03:36,247
Tommy, keep your mouth shut.

27
00:03:36,331 --> 00:03:39,372
I told Pop he was tougher
to have around the house too.

28
00:03:39,456 --> 00:03:42,290
- How much are shoes in New York?
- Give her ten bucks.

29
00:03:42,373 --> 00:03:44,833
Wish me luck, Ma. I'm going to the magazine.

30
00:03:44,917 --> 00:03:47,834
Good luck. I hope it's something
you want and not far away.

31
00:03:47,918 --> 00:03:50,919
It'll be here, or Minify
wouldn't have got us the apartment.

32
00:03:51,002 --> 00:03:54,711
Does he always tell you what to write?
Don't you ever think it up yourself?

33
00:03:54,795 --> 00:03:59,088
Well, yeah, I think sometimes for myself.
Well, I'm late. Have fun.

34
00:03:59,171 --> 00:04:01,506
- Boys' shoes?
- Fourth floor.

35
00:04:01,589 --> 00:04:04,340
- Toy department, please?
- Second floor.

36
00:04:12,675 --> 00:04:17,469
- {y: I}Smith's Weekly, please?
- Reception room, sixth floor. Right in there.

37
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:27,514
- Miss, I did have an appointment.
- I'm sorry. I have no record of it.

38
00:04:27,597 --> 00:04:30,932
I spoke with his secretary.
She said to come in this morning.

39
00:04:31,015 --> 00:04:34,265
He'll be in himself in a half-hour.
I'll try again then.

40
00:04:34,516 --> 00:04:37,558
- Yes, please?
- I have an appointment with Mr Minify.

41
00:04:37,642 --> 00:04:39,518
- Name?
- Schuyler Green.

42
00:04:39,601 --> 00:04:43,520
- Telegram for Mr Pendleton.
- Through the door, second office to the right.

43
00:04:43,603 --> 00:04:48,771
- Thank you.
- Schuyler Green to see Mr Minify. Thank you.

44
00:04:48,854 --> 00:04:51,188
- He's expecting you.
- Mr Herman will call.

45
00:04:51,271 --> 00:04:54,106
Janet. For Mr Minify.

46
00:04:54,189 --> 00:04:56,273
- Follow me, please.
- Thanks.

47
00:04:57,066 --> 00:04:59,149
- Yes?
- Miss Dettrey's expecting me.

48
00:04:59,233 --> 00:05:01,316
Just a moment, please.

49
00:05:16,196 --> 00:05:18,072
- Mr Green.
- Oh, Mr Green.

50
00:05:18,155 --> 00:05:21,824
Mr Minify's on the long distance.
He won't be long. Won't you sit down?

51
00:05:21,907 --> 00:05:24,866
- Have you seen the last issue?
- No. Thank you.

52
00:05:29,701 --> 00:05:32,077
- {y: I}Mr Green out there yet?
- Yes.

53
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,244
<i>Good, I'll be right out,</i>

54
00:05:37,412 --> 00:05:39,746
Come in, come in. Glad you're here, Green.

55
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:44,956
This is all right now, Miss Miller. Get it off
airmail special. Glad to see you. Come on in.

56
00:05:46,373 --> 00:05:48,457
Sit down.

57
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:51,458
- Finding your way around?
- Almost.

58
00:05:51,542 --> 00:05:55,127
- Good. Mother and kid like New York?
- Fine. And the apartment too.

59
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:58,877
Probably the last apartment
left in Manhattan. Meeting people?

60
00:05:58,961 --> 00:06:01,253
Not yet. I'm always slow about that.

61
00:06:01,336 --> 00:06:05,879
Fix that up right away. How about tonight
at my place? Having some people.

62
00:06:05,963 --> 00:06:07,630
Thanks. Some other time.

63
00:06:07,714 --> 00:06:10,922
Nonsense. I won't ask you another time.
Here's the address.

64
00:06:11,006 --> 00:06:16,049
Miss Miller, don't disturb me for anything.
Tell Mrs Minify Mr Green's coming to dinner.

65
00:06:16,133 --> 00:06:18,217
Now, get good and comfortable.

66
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:24,386
There. Because I'm going to talk to you...

67
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:26,553
...for about an hour.

68
00:06:27,761 --> 00:06:29,887
Maybe two.

69
00:06:29,971 --> 00:06:31,847
I've had an idea.

70
00:06:49,769 --> 00:06:52,644
- Do go into the bar, won't you?
- I'd love a martini.

71
00:06:53,353 --> 00:06:55,438
Jessie!

72
00:06:58,647 --> 00:07:02,357
- Schuyler Green I told you about. My wife.
- Oh, John. I know Mr Green.

73
00:07:02,441 --> 00:07:06,149
I've read everything he wrote.
You never stop talking. Get him a drink.

74
00:07:06,232 --> 00:07:08,525
- What'll you have?
- A martini.

75
00:07:09,109 --> 00:07:12,360
Kathy, this is Mr Green.
My niece Miss Lacey, and Bill Lacey.

76
00:07:12,444 --> 00:07:15,737
- How do you do?
- You better clear things up now.

77
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:19,404
- Well, Kathy and Bill...
- They've been divorced for two years.

78
00:07:19,487 --> 00:07:24,614
Calls herself Miss Lacey and confuses
everybody. Very friendly, civilised and dumb.

79
00:07:24,697 --> 00:07:27,115
- Likes your stuff, though.
- Please sit down.

80
00:07:27,198 --> 00:07:29,407
- Bill, would you?
- Way it was before OK?

81
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:34,450
Just right. I haven't read everything
you've written, but what I have has been...

82
00:07:34,533 --> 00:07:35,367
Thanks.

83
00:07:35,451 --> 00:07:37,868
- What do people call a Schuyler?
- Phil.

84
00:07:37,951 --> 00:07:42,412
Good. I don't have to say Green. Too hearty,
last names. And Schuyler is impossible.

85
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:45,079
- That bad?
- I wouldn't call a dog Schuyler.

86
00:07:45,163 --> 00:07:46,663
John!

87
00:07:47,497 --> 00:07:49,622
It's my mother's name.

88
00:07:49,705 --> 00:07:55,333
My middle one. I signed my stuff "Schuyler
Green" on the college paper at Stanford.

89
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:58,250
Sounded better to me, I guess, than Philip.

90
00:07:58,751 --> 00:08:04,294
Like Somerset Maugham instead of William,
Sinclair Lewis instead of Harry.

91
00:08:04,376 --> 00:08:08,503
Somerset, Sinclair, Schuyler - all S's.
Maybe that means something.

92
00:08:08,587 --> 00:08:12,130
- Yes.
- Do you mind telling me what you're writing?

93
00:08:13,297 --> 00:08:15,256
No, not at all.

94
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:19,757
Well, I'm...
I'm not writing anything just now...

95
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,758
...but, uh...
- Let me tell her.

96
00:08:21,841 --> 00:08:24,884
I've asked him to do
a series on anti-Semitism.

97
00:08:24,967 --> 00:08:27,469
- Always wanted to do it.
- Do I get a credit line?

98
00:08:27,552 --> 00:08:29,094
You? For what?

99
00:08:29,178 --> 00:08:32,011
Don't you remember, oh,
back around Christmas...

100
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:34,304
...that Jewish teacher resigning? I was...

101
00:08:34,386 --> 00:08:37,180
I knew somebody was after me. I forgot who.

102
00:08:37,263 --> 00:08:41,431
- John, the Jacksons are here.
- Right. I always steal ideas without realising.

103
00:08:41,514 --> 00:08:44,224
That's what keeps the magazine original!

104
00:08:49,226 --> 00:08:52,018
Funny {y: I}your suggesting the series.

105
00:08:52,101 --> 00:08:54,810
Is it? Why?

106
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:59,187
Oh...

107
00:09:00,729 --> 00:09:02,688
Lots of reasons.

108
00:09:02,771 --> 00:09:06,856
You make up your mind too quickly
about people, Mr Green. Women, anyway.

109
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:11,149
- I saw you do it when you sat down.
- {y: I}(chuckles) As apparent as all that?

110
00:09:11,232 --> 00:09:16,651
You cross-filed and indexed me.
A little too well-bred, self-confident...

111
00:09:17,568 --> 00:09:19,818
Artificial, a trifle absurd.

112
00:09:20,069 --> 00:09:22,612
- Typical New York.
- No. I didn't have time.

113
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:27,196
Yes, you did! I even left out a few things.
Faintly irritating upper-class manner...

114
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:31,989
...over-bright voice...
- All right, all right. I give up. You win.

115
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:36,574
I'm sorry. I couldn't resist it.
Because it's only partly true.

116
00:09:37,116 --> 00:09:39,408
Is this your first trip east?

117
00:09:39,491 --> 00:09:42,618
No. Every other time I've been here, though...

118
00:09:42,701 --> 00:09:46,911
...l've had a plane or railroad
or a boat ticket for tomorrow.

119
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:50,538
- Are you going to stay?
- I think so.

120
00:09:52,995 --> 00:09:56,413
You're getting a pretty complete
story on me. Now it's your turn.

121
00:09:56,497 --> 00:09:59,082
Well, you know I'm divorced.

122
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:02,999
Um, I help run a nursery school.
I'm called Miss Lacey.

123
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,042
Do you wantjust anything?

124
00:10:09,626 --> 00:10:12,127
- Just anything.
- Dinner.

125
00:10:13,586 --> 00:10:15,462
Dinner?

126
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,462
- No reading comics at the table. Put it away.
- Oh, let me finish. I'm right at the end.

127
00:10:27,545 --> 00:10:30,881
- No making mysteries at the table, Phil.
- Mysteries?

128
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:33,547
- You haven't mentioned your assignment.
- Oh.

129
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:36,674
He wants me to do a series on anti-Semitism.

130
00:10:36,758 --> 00:10:39,885
- You don't sound very enthusiastic.
- I'm not.

131
00:10:40,969 --> 00:10:45,263
- Will he insist on your doing it?
- Oh, no. He's not that kind of an editor.

132
00:10:45,346 --> 00:10:48,848
Ma, what do you do to just eggs
to make them taste this way?

133
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:51,766
Pray over them.

134
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,061
- Have a good time last night?
- Yeah.

135
00:10:58,479 --> 00:11:01,688
You know, you need new people
as much as you need new places.

136
00:11:01,772 --> 00:11:04,148
I mean, everybody does, notjust you.

137
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:07,859
It was a good bunch to start on.
The funny thing: It was a girl...

138
00:11:07,942 --> 00:11:11,611
...Minify's niece, who suggested
that series on anti-Semitism.

139
00:11:12,111 --> 00:11:15,571
You don't say!
Why, women'll be thinking next, Phil.

140
00:11:15,654 --> 00:11:17,572
- What's anti-Semitism?
- Hm?

141
00:11:17,655 --> 00:11:19,740
What's anti-Semitism?

142
00:11:20,616 --> 00:11:25,118
Oh, that's where some people don't like
other people just because they're Jews.

143
00:11:25,452 --> 00:11:28,495
Oh. Why? Are they bad?

144
00:11:28,578 --> 00:11:32,163
Some are, sure. Some aren't.
It's like everybody else.

145
00:11:32,747 --> 00:11:36,083
What are Jews, anyway? I mean exactly.

146
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:41,294
Well, remember last week when
you asked me about that church...

147
00:11:41,377 --> 00:11:44,045
...and I said there were different churches?
- Yeah.

148
00:11:44,128 --> 00:11:48,672
Well, the people who go to that
particular church are called Catholics, see?

149
00:11:48,756 --> 00:11:52,549
There are people who go to other churches
and they're called Protestants.

150
00:11:52,633 --> 00:11:56,676
Then there are others who go to
still different ones, and they're Jews...

151
00:11:56,759 --> 00:12:00,095
...only they call their churches
synagogues or temples.

152
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:02,889
And why don't some people like those?

153
00:12:05,598 --> 00:12:08,892
That's kind of a tough one to explain, Tom.

154
00:12:08,975 --> 00:12:11,685
Some people hate Catholics, some hate Jews.

155
00:12:12,102 --> 00:12:14,311
And no one hates us cos we're Americans!

156
00:12:14,395 --> 00:12:16,313
<i>(clears throat)</i>

157
00:12:16,397 --> 00:12:20,564
Well, no. No, that's...
That's another thing again.

158
00:12:20,648 --> 00:12:24,234
You can be American and a Catholic
or American and a Protestant...

159
00:12:24,317 --> 00:12:26,652
...or American and a Jew.

160
00:12:26,735 --> 00:12:29,695
Look, Tom. It's like this.

161
00:12:29,778 --> 00:12:34,614
One thing's your country, like America
or France or Germany - all the countries.

162
00:12:35,074 --> 00:12:38,448
The flag is different,
the uniform is different and the language.

163
00:12:38,532 --> 00:12:41,576
- And the airplanes are marked different?
- That's right.

164
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:46,162
But the other thing is religion, like the
Jewish, Catholic or Protestant religion, see?

165
00:12:46,246 --> 00:12:50,665
That hasn't anything to do with the flag
or the uniform or the planes. You got it?

166
00:12:50,748 --> 00:12:52,623
- Yup.
- Don't get mixed up on it.

167
00:12:52,707 --> 00:12:56,042
- I got it.
- Some people are mixed up.

168
00:12:56,126 --> 00:12:57,710
Why?

169
00:12:57,793 --> 00:13:01,212
- It's 8.30, Tommy. You better get going.
- Yeah, you'll be late.

170
00:13:01,295 --> 00:13:03,381
Finish your milk.

171
00:13:07,924 --> 00:13:10,009
Thanks, Grandma. Bye.

172
00:13:11,426 --> 00:13:13,302
Phew!

173
00:13:13,969 --> 00:13:18,722
- That's all right, Phil. You're good with him.
- That kid's gonna wreck me yet!

174
00:13:18,972 --> 00:13:22,557
- Did you and Dad go through this with me?
- Course we did.

175
00:13:26,476 --> 00:13:30,394
- Are you very disappointed, Phil?
- Yes, I am.

176
00:13:30,478 --> 00:13:34,354
I was almost sure he'd hand me
the Stassen story. Or Washington.

177
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:39,691
I wasn't looking for an easy one, Ma. But
I did want something I could make good on.

178
00:13:39,775 --> 00:13:43,360
I'd so like the first one here
to be a natural, something they'd read.

179
00:13:43,444 --> 00:13:46,863
So there's enough anti-Semitism in life
without reading about it?

180
00:13:46,945 --> 00:13:50,363
No. But this one's doomed before I've started.

181
00:13:51,072 --> 00:13:54,116
What could I possibly say
that hasn't been said before?

182
00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:56,284
I don't know.

183
00:13:57,492 --> 00:13:59,578
Maybe it hasn't been said well enough.

184
00:13:59,661 --> 00:14:04,621
If it had, you wouldn't have had to explain it
to Tommy just now, your father and I to you.

185
00:14:04,705 --> 00:14:09,333
It would be nice sometime not to
have to explain it to someone like Tommy.

186
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,709
Kids are so decent to start with.

187
00:14:14,169 --> 00:14:16,461
- Home for lunch?
- No.

188
00:14:18,129 --> 00:14:20,213
Think I'll take a walk.

189
00:14:22,965 --> 00:14:25,050
You're quite a girl, Ma.

190
00:15:00,818 --> 00:15:02,778
You seem surprised. Why?

191
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:05,946
I didn't think you'd do it.
You've a bad poker face, Phil.

192
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:09,699
You were disappointed in the assignment
the minute I mentioned it.

193
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:12,074
- What changed your mind?
- A couple of things.

194
00:15:12,157 --> 00:15:15,202
I may put my niece under contract.
Inspiration department.

195
00:15:15,285 --> 00:15:18,371
No, it wasn't that. It was my kid.

196
00:15:18,454 --> 00:15:21,830
I had to explain it to him this morning.
It was kind of tough.

197
00:15:21,914 --> 00:15:27,042
It's really each house, each family, that
decides it. Anyway, I wanna do it very much.

198
00:15:27,124 --> 00:15:30,834
- I couldn't be more pleased.
- I'll have to get some facts and figures.

199
00:15:30,918 --> 00:15:34,379
- What?!
- I said I'll have to get facts and figures.

200
00:15:34,462 --> 00:15:37,714
Wait a minute. Hold on.
I've got 18 hacks on this magazine...

201
00:15:37,798 --> 00:15:41,383
...who can do this series
with their hands full of facts and figures.

202
00:15:41,466 --> 00:15:45,385
I don't need you for that. What do you
think I brought you here for, facts?

203
00:15:45,468 --> 00:15:47,636
Use your head. Go right to the source.

204
00:15:47,719 --> 00:15:50,180
I want some angle, some compelling lead.

205
00:15:50,263 --> 00:15:53,180
Some dramatic device
to humanise it so it gets read.

206
00:15:53,263 --> 00:15:56,057
- You don't want much, just the moon!
- With parsley.

207
00:15:56,140 --> 00:16:00,935
Suggestion: There's a bigger thing to do than
to go after the crackpot story. It's been done.

208
00:16:01,018 --> 00:16:03,186
It's the wider spread that I want.

209
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:08,815
The people that'd never go to an anti-Semitic
meeting or send a dime to Gerald LK Smith.

210
00:16:10,606 --> 00:16:12,691
All right.

211
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,567
I'll knock it around.

212
00:16:15,651 --> 00:16:20,029
Give my best to
the research department. So long.

213
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:22,487
You don't happen
to want my niece's number?

214
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:26,073
Regent 70493. We're having dinner together.

215
00:16:26,782 --> 00:16:29,075
I always like to go right to the source.

216
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:35,703
- Fresh coffee, sir.
- Oh, thank you.

217
00:16:39,956 --> 00:16:42,708
- You're a flattering listener.
- I'm interested.

218
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:47,460
No, it's more than that. Your face takes sides,
as if you were voting for and against.

219
00:16:47,877 --> 00:16:51,629
When I told you about my longing
to have a nice home, you looked happy.

220
00:16:51,713 --> 00:16:56,841
When I told you about Uncle John offering
to send me to Vassar, you looked bleak.

221
00:16:57,549 --> 00:16:59,800
How'd your parents take it...

222
00:16:59,884 --> 00:17:05,053
...about Mr Minify giving you an allowance
and pretty clothes and all the rest?

223
00:17:05,345 --> 00:17:10,639
Oh, they said they wanted Jane, my sister,
and me to have things that'd make us happy.

224
00:17:12,473 --> 00:17:15,310
- And did they?
- Yes, I think so.

225
00:17:16,267 --> 00:17:18,435
I quit being envious.

226
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:21,937
And... snobbish.

227
00:17:22,896 --> 00:17:25,607
I felt right and easy.

228
00:17:26,398 --> 00:17:28,859
Now you're looking all dubious again.

229
00:17:28,942 --> 00:17:34,235
Oh, please, don't think that I'm just
sitting here approving and disapproving.

230
00:17:36,236 --> 00:17:39,363
It's not that. It's... It's just that...

231
00:17:41,741 --> 00:17:43,825
Well, I...

232
00:17:45,241 --> 00:17:48,160
We've certainly covered a lot of ground.

233
00:17:49,785 --> 00:17:52,330
Are you engaged to anybody now?

234
00:17:52,412 --> 00:17:54,371
Or in love or anything?

235
00:17:54,455 --> 00:17:56,540
Not especially.

236
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:59,874
Are you?

237
00:18:00,667 --> 00:18:02,918
Not anything.

238
00:18:05,878 --> 00:18:07,754
Dance?

239
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:11,048
Oh, by the way...

240
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:15,841
...why was your ex-husband asked
up to the Minifys' when you were there?

241
00:18:16,008 --> 00:18:18,718
- They trying to bring you together?
- Could be.

242
00:18:18,843 --> 00:18:21,470
Aunt Jessie does it every once in a while.

243
00:18:23,012 --> 00:18:25,097
Did you ask me to dance?

244
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,066
He'll be right here.

245
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:21,941
He's still at it.

246
00:19:23,193 --> 00:19:27,781
Hi! How's the big outside world?
Still there? Everybody having fun?

247
00:19:27,865 --> 00:19:31,867
No, no, I'm fine.
Just wish I were dead, that's all.

248
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:35,410
Thanks. I'm in my stubborn streak now.
If it won't budge, I won't.

249
00:19:35,827 --> 00:19:39,830
Great. At the rate it's going,
do you think you'd like me with white hair?

250
00:19:39,913 --> 00:19:44,876
Yeah, I think you'd look dandy with
white hair. I'll be right here still trying.

251
00:19:44,959 --> 00:19:49,588
No, do. If you don't call, I wonder why,
so it works out as an interruption either way.

252
00:19:49,671 --> 00:19:53,090
Well, I work myself.
How many interruptions a day do you want?

253
00:19:53,341 --> 00:19:58,678
Oh, I'll thank you to call me five or six times
a day. It's your fault I'm in this jam anyway.

254
00:19:58,762 --> 00:20:01,057
OK. Bye.

255
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,726
Why not take some time off?
You've been at it for a week.

256
00:20:06,809 --> 00:20:10,730
Oh, you know me, Ma.
I'd be no fun for Kathy or anybody else.

257
00:20:10,813 --> 00:20:13,189
I'm certainly no fun for myself.

258
00:20:13,272 --> 00:20:15,858
- No ideas at all yet?
- Sure, plenty...

259
00:20:15,942 --> 00:20:19,945
...but they all explode in my face
after an hour. They don't stand up.

260
00:20:20,028 --> 00:20:23,279
When you get the right one
a click happens inside of you.

261
00:20:23,363 --> 00:20:26,033
It hasn't happened yet,
and doesn't look like it will.

262
00:20:26,116 --> 00:20:30,911
I'm bored with the whole thing.
Bored with myself, as a matter of fact.

263
00:20:30,994 --> 00:20:35,748
Hey, Ma, do you think I'm losing my grip?
Writers do. Maybe it's my turn.

264
00:20:35,831 --> 00:20:38,500
You better not.
You couldn't make it at anything else.

265
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:42,087
Well, thanks, you can go now.
That's a big help!

266
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:44,463
Bring those things in with you, will you?

267
00:20:44,546 --> 00:20:47,423
Isn't it always tough at the start, Phil?

268
00:20:47,507 --> 00:20:49,717
Never like this.

269
00:20:49,801 --> 00:20:51,885
Never. I've tried everything.

270
00:20:51,969 --> 00:20:56,806
Anti-Semitism in business, professions.
It's all there, but I can't make it give.

271
00:20:56,889 --> 00:21:01,934
I've tried it separately and together. Each time
I think I'm on the edge of something good...

272
00:21:02,017 --> 00:21:06,480
...it turns into the same old drool
of statistics and protest.

273
00:21:06,562 --> 00:21:09,983
It's like beating your head
against a concrete wall.

274
00:21:11,732 --> 00:21:13,985
Gee, I wish Dave were here.

275
00:21:14,068 --> 00:21:15,945
- Dave Goldman?
- Yeah.

276
00:21:16,028 --> 00:21:19,407
- He'd be the guy to talk it over with.
- Yes. Still overseas?

277
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:23,867
Yeah. Looks like he's stuck there too.
He'd be just the one, though.

278
00:21:24,452 --> 00:21:27,120
Hey. Hey, Ma, maybe that's a new tack.

279
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:32,165
So far I've been digging into facts
and evidence. I've sort of ignored feelings.

280
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:36,378
- How must a fellow like Dave feel about this?
- That's good, Phil.

281
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:40,713
Over and above what we feel about it,
what must a Jew feel about this thing?

282
00:21:40,796 --> 00:21:44,258
Dave! Can I think my way into Dave's mind?

283
00:21:44,341 --> 00:21:46,634
He's the kind of fellow I'd be if I were a Jew.

284
00:21:46,718 --> 00:21:50,972
We grew up together, lived in the same
kind of homes, did everything together.

285
00:21:51,055 --> 00:21:55,515
Whatever Dave feels now:
Indifference, outrage, contempt...

286
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:00,937
...would be the feelings of Dave not only as a
Jew, but the way I feel as a man, an American.

287
00:22:01,021 --> 00:22:03,439
- Is that right, Ma?
- Write him a letter.

288
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:08,026
- Maybe I've broken this log jam. This is it.
- Put it down like you just said it to me.

289
00:22:16,491 --> 00:22:18,575
Now what do I say?

290
00:22:21,827 --> 00:22:26,498
What do I say? "Dear Dave, how do you feel
when you hear Rankin calling people kikes?"

291
00:22:26,582 --> 00:22:31,377
"Or when you hear about Jewish kids getting
their teeth kicked out by Jew-haters here?"

292
00:22:31,461 --> 00:22:34,464
Could you write that kind of a letter, Ma?

293
00:22:34,547 --> 00:22:38,548
No, that's no good, all of it.
It wouldn't be any good if I could write it.

294
00:22:38,632 --> 00:22:42,968
There isn't any way you can tear open the
secret heart of another human being, Ma.

295
00:22:43,053 --> 00:22:47,263
Yes, I guess you're right,
but there must be some way. There must!

296
00:22:47,347 --> 00:22:51,600
Hey, don't you get started.
I don't wanna depress the whole family.

297
00:22:51,683 --> 00:22:53,353
You look tired. Go to bed.

298
00:22:53,436 --> 00:22:57,940
One good thing came out of this anyway.
Reminded me I owe Dave a letter.

299
00:22:58,023 --> 00:23:01,358
And I'd like more sympathy
now that you see how tough it is.

300
00:23:01,441 --> 00:23:03,817
Sympathy? Oh, no.

301
00:23:03,901 --> 00:23:08,280
- I think it's worth it, if it's any consolation.
- It's mighty small, Ma...

302
00:23:08,364 --> 00:23:10,864
...but I'm in no position to dicker.

303
00:23:10,949 --> 00:23:13,034
Good night, baby.

304
00:23:37,677 --> 00:23:39,762
<i>(moaning)</i>

305
00:23:53,022 --> 00:23:54,898
Tommy?

306
00:23:55,691 --> 00:23:57,776
<i>(gasping)</i>

307
00:24:01,653 --> 00:24:03,530
Ma!

308
00:24:04,947 --> 00:24:08,409
- Is it your heart? Does it seem like the heart?
- Wait.

309
00:24:13,287 --> 00:24:15,371
You all right? Seem any easier?

310
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:22,961
- Passing.
- Well, I'll get a doctor. I'll phone Kathy.

311
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:24,713
- No.
- She'll know one.

312
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,672
Wait.

313
00:24:28,506 --> 00:24:30,383
Oh...

314
00:24:33,218 --> 00:24:38,431
I never... realised pain could be so... sharp.

315
00:24:38,514 --> 00:24:41,850
You let me phone Kathy.
She'll know a heart man.

316
00:24:43,309 --> 00:24:47,186
- What time is it?
- Oh, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.

317
00:24:49,732 --> 00:24:51,816
Come on.

318
00:24:53,984 --> 00:24:56,694
- Come back and hold my hand.
- Sure, sure.

319
00:25:18,794 --> 00:25:21,881
Will she die, Pop? Will she?

320
00:25:21,964 --> 00:25:26,467
Well, she'll die some day, Tom.
Just like you or me or anybody.

321
00:25:26,551 --> 00:25:29,719
The doctor said she might
be fine for years if she's careful.

322
00:25:29,802 --> 00:25:34,514
Your grandma's not young, Tom, and all
that packing and unpacking tired her out.

323
00:25:34,598 --> 00:25:38,017
- I'll bet we can run this place between us.
- Sure.

324
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,768
Pop, what are we...

325
00:25:39,852 --> 00:25:41,938
It's scary, Tom. I know.

326
00:25:42,021 --> 00:25:44,940
I was scared last night myself, plenty.

327
00:25:45,023 --> 00:25:49,067
We'll take care of her and she might be fine
until you're married and have kids.

328
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:51,027
- {y: I}(buzzer)
- That's the doctor.

329
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:53,695
- Will you make brea{y: I}kfast and go to school?
- Sure.

330
00:25:53,779 --> 00:25:56,949
We'll run this place just fine.
You get going now.

331
00:26:15,963 --> 00:26:21,466
I told your mother the truth: People with
hearts outlive everyone else, if they take care.

332
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:25,719
This may prove to be what we call
"false angina", instead of the true angina.

333
00:26:25,803 --> 00:26:27,972
You keep her in bed for a few days...

334
00:26:28,055 --> 00:26:30,890
...then we'll get her
to the office and really see.

335
00:26:30,974 --> 00:26:33,350
No use getting too technical until we know.

336
00:26:33,433 --> 00:26:36,937
- Doctor, are you sure?
- I never minimise at a time like this.

337
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,355
I don't frighten, but I don't minimise.

338
00:26:39,438 --> 00:26:42,607
- Right now it's nothing to worry about.
- {y: I}(Mrs Green) Phil.

339
00:26:42,691 --> 00:26:46,443
Go ahead. I know the way out.
I'll keep dropping in for the next few days.

340
00:26:46,527 --> 00:26:48,612
Thank you.

341
00:26:52,031 --> 00:26:56,410
- Everything OK?
- No need to look like Hamlet. I feel great.

342
00:26:56,743 --> 00:27:00,413
Well, don't crowd things. Feel like talking?

343
00:27:00,496 --> 00:27:03,039
Ever know me when I didn't?
Except last night.

344
00:27:03,123 --> 00:27:06,750
<i>(chuckles) Now I really believe
the doctor for the first time.</i>

345
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:08,587
Good. So do I.

346
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:13,089
- Tommy get off all right?
- Sure he did. Fixed his own brea{y: I}kfast too.

347
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:14,965
- I'll be up tomorrow.
- You won't.

348
00:27:15,048 --> 00:27:16,967
- Yes, I will.
- No, you won't.

349
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:19,510
- Get any sleep?
- Sure.

350
00:27:19,594 --> 00:27:21,679
Eyes like poached eggs.

351
00:27:22,388 --> 00:27:25,140
Get some sleep today.
Don't try to work, please.

352
00:27:25,223 --> 00:27:30,268
Well, you don't need to worry about that, Ma.
I've decided. I'm gonna phone Minify.

353
00:27:30,351 --> 00:27:36,023
There's a virtue in knowing when you're
licked. I'm licked and I might as well accept it.

354
00:27:36,106 --> 00:27:38,692
- I decided last night.
- When?

355
00:27:38,775 --> 00:27:41,944
- When I was with you, waiting for the doctor.
- Why?

356
00:27:42,611 --> 00:27:45,404
Well, I was scared, Ma.

357
00:27:45,488 --> 00:27:51,202
Like I used to be when I'd get to wondering
what I'd do if anything ever happened to you.

358
00:27:51,285 --> 00:27:54,077
It all came back.
I was a kid again and my ma was sick.

359
00:27:54,161 --> 00:27:55,663
Now, Phil.

360
00:27:55,747 --> 00:27:58,372
I wanted to ask
"Is it awful? Are you afraid?"

361
00:27:58,456 --> 00:28:04,252
But... there are some questions nobody
can ask, and they can't be answered.

362
00:28:04,336 --> 00:28:08,172
I'll know the answer to those two
when I feel it myself, when {y: I}I'm lying there.

363
00:28:08,255 --> 00:28:13,468
And that's the way it is with the series, Ma.
I can't really write it.

364
00:28:13,635 --> 00:28:18,722
But you got the answers before. Every article
you wrote, the right answers got in somehow.

365
00:28:18,889 --> 00:28:23,808
Yeah, but I didn't ask for them. When I wanted
to find out about a scared guy in ajalopy...

366
00:28:23,892 --> 00:28:28,521
...I didn't stand on Route 66 and
stop him so I could ask a lot of questions.

367
00:28:28,604 --> 00:28:33,441
I bought myself some old clothes and a
broken-down car and took Route 66 myself.

368
00:28:33,526 --> 00:28:36,235
I lived in their camps, ate what they ate.

369
00:28:36,317 --> 00:28:39,445
I found the answers in my own guts,
not somebody else's.

370
00:28:39,695 --> 00:28:45,116
I didn't say "What does it feel like to be an
Okie?" I {y: I}was an Okie. That's the difference.

371
00:28:45,534 --> 00:28:49,620
On the coal-mine series, I didn't sit in
my bedroom and do a lot of research, did I?

372
00:28:49,703 --> 00:28:53,581
I didn't go tap some poor, grimy guy
on the shoulder and make him talk.

373
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:57,376
I got myself ajob. I went down
in the dark. I slept in a shack.

374
00:28:57,459 --> 00:29:01,838
I didn't try to dig into
a coal miner's heart. I {y: I}was a miner.

375
00:29:07,049 --> 00:29:08,926
Ma...

376
00:29:09,593 --> 00:29:11,678
<i>(whispers) Maybe...</i>

377
00:29:11,761 --> 00:29:13,847
Hey, maybe...

378
00:29:16,223 --> 00:29:17,891
I got it!

379
00:29:17,974 --> 00:29:21,853
A lead, the idea, the angle.
This is the way! It's the {y: I}only way.

380
00:29:21,936 --> 00:29:24,437
I'll... I'll be Jewish!

381
00:29:25,021 --> 00:29:30,234
I'll... Well, all I gotta do is say it. Nobody
knows me around here. I can just say it.

382
00:29:30,317 --> 00:29:34,195
I can live it myself for six weeks,
eight weeks, no matter how long it takes.

383
00:29:34,279 --> 00:29:38,073
- Ma, it's right this time!
- It must be. Always is when you're this sure.

384
00:29:38,157 --> 00:29:42,286
Listen, I even got the title:
"I Was Jewish for Six Months."

385
00:29:43,035 --> 00:29:45,120
It's right, Phil.

386
00:29:45,245 --> 00:29:47,038
Ma...

387
00:29:47,122 --> 00:29:49,206
This is it.

388
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:52,376
That clickjust happened inside of me.

389
00:29:53,042 --> 00:29:58,338
It won't be the same, sure, but it'll be close.
I can just say I am and see what happens.

390
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:01,257
It'll work. It'll work fine, Phil.

391
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:06,178
Dark hair, dark eyes. Sure, so has Dave.
So have a lot of guys who aren't Jewish.

392
00:30:06,261 --> 00:30:09,180
No accent, no mannerisms. Neither has Dave.

393
00:30:11,557 --> 00:30:13,224
Name: Phil Green.

394
00:30:13,308 --> 00:30:16,143
Skip the Schuyler. Might be anything.

395
00:30:16,226 --> 00:30:18,478
Phil Green!

396
00:30:18,561 --> 00:30:23,023
- Ma, it's a cinch.
- This is the best medicine I could have had.

397
00:30:23,106 --> 00:30:26,943
Will you keep my secret if you meet people?
It has to be without exceptions.

398
00:30:27,027 --> 00:30:30,279
- If you're Jewish, I am too.
- Take it easy, don't get excited.

399
00:30:30,362 --> 00:30:32,447
I gotta phone right away.

400
00:30:34,741 --> 00:30:37,534
Why don't you have Kathy come over here?

401
00:30:37,618 --> 00:30:40,913
- How'd you know I wouldn't phone Minify?
- Dope.

402
00:30:40,996 --> 00:30:44,790
Nobody phones a magazine editor
with that look on his face.

403
00:30:47,584 --> 00:30:53,506
- Oh, Phil, it's nice. It's attractive.
- It's not done yet. The packages are pictures.

404
00:30:53,589 --> 00:30:55,256
- A fireplace.
- Works too.

405
00:30:55,339 --> 00:30:59,009
Mine's fake. How's your mother?
Dr Craigie said she'd be fine.

406
00:30:59,092 --> 00:31:01,219
Oh, she's all right.

407
00:31:01,302 --> 00:31:04,721
- What's the angle? Tell me fast!
- I will. I'll just check up on Ma.

408
00:31:04,805 --> 00:31:06,890
Good. Give her my love.

409
00:31:28,114 --> 00:31:31,201
- She's sleeping like a baby.
- Good. Don't worry about her.

410
00:31:31,283 --> 00:31:34,245
- Let's have a drink. Some sherry?
- All right.

411
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:41,415
- You're still not telling me.
- Funny. I thought I'd spill it out immediately.

412
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:43,668
- You sounded so excited.
- I am.

413
00:31:43,751 --> 00:31:47,755
- Must be really something.
- There'll be stumbling blocks but I don't care.

414
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:50,005
I'll lick them...

415
00:31:50,089 --> 00:31:52,173
I'll lick them when I get to them.

416
00:32:00,556 --> 00:32:02,433
Kathy!

417
00:32:03,474 --> 00:32:05,350
Phil!

418
00:32:20,863 --> 00:32:22,947
Phil, wait now.

419
00:32:25,783 --> 00:32:28,117
You go over there
and let me sit here a minute.

420
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,120
What is it, Kathy?

421
00:32:30,203 --> 00:32:31,745
Nothing.

422
00:32:32,704 --> 00:32:34,789
I was just thinking.

423
00:32:37,541 --> 00:32:41,878
Marriage can be such
a good way to live, Kathy.

424
00:32:41,961 --> 00:32:44,506
All these years I've kept hoping.

425
00:32:44,881 --> 00:32:47,465
I've kept hoping too.

426
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:50,885
But when you've made
a mistake once, you're afraid.

427
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:55,221
You're not afraid now?

428
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,141
No, Phil.

429
00:32:58,224 --> 00:33:00,100
Darling...

430
00:33:01,933 --> 00:33:06,188
- What are you smiling at? No secrets.
- I was just thinking.

431
00:33:07,064 --> 00:33:12,360
I was just playing that old game -
all women do it. Trying out the name.

432
00:33:12,444 --> 00:33:14,527
Say it out loud.

433
00:33:18,697 --> 00:33:20,991
Mrs Schuyler Green.

434
00:33:23,117 --> 00:33:25,202
How does it sound?

435
00:33:26,579 --> 00:33:28,662
It sounds just fine.

436
00:33:30,289 --> 00:33:32,583
How does it look on me?

437
00:33:32,666 --> 00:33:34,752
I like it.

438
00:33:35,293 --> 00:33:37,378
Kathy...

439
00:33:37,462 --> 00:33:40,297
...you're not sorry about... Tom?

440
00:33:41,091 --> 00:33:47,594
I'm glad. It's as if my marriage hadn't been
wasted, as if I'd had a son growing up for me.

441
00:34:00,687 --> 00:34:03,898
I knew you'd get it. Can you get away with it?

442
00:34:03,981 --> 00:34:07,902
If you and Kathy and Mrs Minify
won't give me away. I haven't told Kathy yet.

443
00:34:07,985 --> 00:34:11,195
- I'll tell Mrs Minify. When do you start?
- What about now?

444
00:34:11,278 --> 00:34:15,615
Fine. I'll get you an office and a secretary.
But the secretary would have to know.

445
00:34:15,698 --> 00:34:21,578
Yeah... Well, why? Supposing I were Jewish.
What difference would it make to her?

446
00:34:21,662 --> 00:34:24,872
You're right, Phil.
I'm excited. They'll read this.

447
00:34:24,955 --> 00:34:28,332
- Mr Minify, Mr Weisman is waiting.
- Yes.

448
00:34:28,417 --> 00:34:33,003
What about lunch? Chance to meet the whole
staff. Irving Weisman is lunching with us.

449
00:34:33,087 --> 00:34:36,840
- Yeah. He's the big industrialist.
- Yes. He's a colourful fellow.

450
00:34:36,923 --> 00:34:39,633
Old friend of mine. I know you'll like him.

451
00:34:46,347 --> 00:34:48,974
Sorry we're late. Very sorry, Irving.

452
00:34:49,058 --> 00:34:52,058
- Mr Phil Green. Mr Irving Weisman.
- Mr Weisman.

453
00:34:52,142 --> 00:34:57,188
Lew Jordan, our personnel manager.
Joe Tingler, our demon photographer.

454
00:34:57,272 --> 00:35:00,566
Bert McAnny, best layout man
this side of the Mexican border.

455
00:35:00,649 --> 00:35:04,194
And last, as a kind of dessert,
Anne Dettrey, our fashion editor.

456
00:35:04,278 --> 00:35:07,154
- Clever and dangerous. Eats men alive!
- Thank you.

457
00:35:07,237 --> 00:35:09,656
Sit down beside her.

458
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:12,451
- Isn't it Schuyler Green?
- That's my writing name.

459
00:35:12,534 --> 00:35:17,037
- Mr Green will do a series on anti-Semitism.
- Really?

460
00:35:17,121 --> 00:35:18,580
Again?

461
00:35:18,663 --> 00:35:22,750
Not again. For the first time.
We're going to split it wide open.

462
00:35:22,833 --> 00:35:26,919
Do you mind my saying, as an old friend,
I think it a very bad idea, John?

463
00:35:27,003 --> 00:35:32,340
- It's the most harmful thing you can do now.
- Not at all. Why is it a harmful idea?

464
00:35:32,549 --> 00:35:35,926
Because it'll only stir it up more,
that's why. Let it alone.

465
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:38,469
- We'll handle it in our way.
- The hush-hush way?

466
00:35:38,552 --> 00:35:41,264
I don't care what you call it. Let it alone.

467
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:43,765
You can't write it out of existence.

468
00:35:43,848 --> 00:35:47,976
We've fought it for years.
We know the less talk about it, the better.

469
00:35:48,143 --> 00:35:53,355
Sure. Pretend it doesn't exist and add to
the conspiracy of silence. I should say not.

470
00:35:53,438 --> 00:35:58,525
Keep silent and let Bilbo and
Gerald LK Smith do all the talking? No, sir.

471
00:35:58,609 --> 00:36:04,197
Irving, you and your let's-be-quiet-about-it
committees have gotjust exactly no place.

472
00:36:04,281 --> 00:36:08,617
We're going to call a spade a dirty spade.
I think it's high time and a fine idea.

473
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,119
So do I. I couldn't agree with Mr Minify more.

474
00:36:11,203 --> 00:36:15,039
- You sound pretty hot about it.
- Well, I feel pretty hot about it.

475
00:36:15,122 --> 00:36:19,959
And I don't think it has anything
to do with the fact that I'm Jewish myself.

476
00:36:32,968 --> 00:36:35,845
- Right office?
- Mr Green? Yes, sir, this is your office.

477
00:36:35,929 --> 00:36:38,807
I'm your secretary, Miss Wales. Elaine Wales.

478
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:40,975
How do you do?

479
00:36:49,231 --> 00:36:51,941
- Mind if we get right to work?
- Not at all.

480
00:37:03,741 --> 00:37:06,369
- You know about the series I'm doing?
- Yes, sir.

481
00:37:06,452 --> 00:37:10,788
Good. I wanna start a file. I want you
to write form letters to clubs, resorts...

482
00:37:10,871 --> 00:37:16,502
...interviews forjobs, apartments for lease,
applications for medical schools and so forth.

483
00:37:16,585 --> 00:37:19,546
- I got a whole list here somewhere.
- Yes, sir.

484
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:24,174
Write all the letters on blank stationery
and send two to each address.

485
00:37:24,258 --> 00:37:28,844
One I wanna sign "Schuyler Green" and the
other "Philip Greenberg". See what I mean?

486
00:37:28,927 --> 00:37:32,597
- Yes, sir.
- Have the replies sent to my home address.

487
00:37:32,681 --> 00:37:34,265
Yes, sir.

488
00:37:34,348 --> 00:37:38,560
Course you know it will be "yes"
to the Greens and "no" to the Greenbergs.

489
00:37:38,643 --> 00:37:41,061
Sure, but I want it for the record.

490
00:37:41,145 --> 00:37:46,692
Now, if your name was Saul Green or Irving,
you wouldn't have to go to all this bother.

491
00:37:46,775 --> 00:37:51,154
- I changed mine. Did you?
- Wales? No, Green's always been my name.

492
00:37:51,237 --> 00:37:54,404
- What's yours?
- Walovsky. Estelle Walovsky.

493
00:37:54,487 --> 00:37:57,532
And I just couldn't take it.
About applications, I mean.

494
00:37:57,615 --> 00:38:02,661
So one day I wrote the same firm two letters.
Same as you're doing now.

495
00:38:02,911 --> 00:38:08,081
I sent the Elaine Wales one {y: I}after they'd said
there were no openings to my first one.

496
00:38:08,165 --> 00:38:10,417
I got the job all right.

497
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,585
Do you know what firm that was?

498
00:38:13,252 --> 00:38:15,339
<i>Smith's Weekly,</i>

499
00:38:16,589 --> 00:38:19,550
- No!
- {y: I}(laughs) Yes, Mr Green.

500
00:38:19,633 --> 00:38:24,345
A great liberal magazine
that fights injustice on all sides.

501
00:38:24,428 --> 00:38:26,721
It slays me. I love it.

502
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:31,808
- Mr Minify know about it?
- He wouldn't bother thinking about small fry.

503
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:34,685
That's Mr Jordan's department,
hiring and firing.

504
00:38:34,769 --> 00:38:39,898
But if anybody snitched, you know there'd be
some excuse for throwing them out.

505
00:38:41,607 --> 00:38:45,860
So anyway, I thought maybe
you had changed yours sometime.

506
00:38:46,653 --> 00:38:48,987
I mean, when I heard you were Jewish.

507
00:38:50,322 --> 00:38:52,616
You heard it?

508
00:38:52,699 --> 00:38:54,784
Why, sure.

509
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:58,496
- Is this the list?
- Yeah.

510
00:38:59,913 --> 00:39:01,998
When?

511
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:08,211
Well, when you finished luncheon
and went back to Mr Minify's office...

512
00:39:09,879 --> 00:39:12,173
...it kind of got around.

513
00:39:21,513 --> 00:39:23,972
She'll be up and about day after tomorrow.

514
00:39:24,056 --> 00:39:26,850
You wouldn't mind
if I had her see an internist?

515
00:39:26,934 --> 00:39:29,435
No. I'll make an appointment if you wish.

516
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:33,188
I use Mason Van Dick or James Kent.
Or if you've someone you'd like?

517
00:39:33,271 --> 00:39:38,651
One of the editors at the magazine
recommended someone. Dr... Dr Abrahams.

518
00:39:38,734 --> 00:39:40,111
Abrahams?

519
00:39:40,194 --> 00:39:43,612
Yes. JE Abrahams, Mount Sinai Hospital,
Beth Israel, or both.

520
00:39:44,028 --> 00:39:50,076
Yes, of course. If you decide to have your
mother see Van Dick or Kent, I'll arrange it.

521
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:55,288
- Why? Isn't this Abrahams fellow any good?
- No, nothing like that. Good man.

522
00:39:55,372 --> 00:39:58,956
Not given to overcharging
and stringing visits out...

523
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:01,334
...the way {y: I}some do.

524
00:40:01,793 --> 00:40:06,839
You mean the way some doctors do, or do
you mean the way some Jewish doctors do?

525
00:40:06,922 --> 00:40:11,633
<i>(laughs) I suppose you're right.
I suppose some of us do it too.</i>

526
00:40:11,717 --> 00:40:14,385
Not just the chosen people.

527
00:40:14,468 --> 00:40:17,846
If Abrahams doesn't impress me,
I'll try Van Dick or Kent.

528
00:40:17,929 --> 00:40:22,933
I've no special loyalty to Jewish doctors
simply because I'm Jewish myself.

529
00:40:23,935 --> 00:40:28,229
No, of course not. Good man's a good man.

530
00:40:28,313 --> 00:40:30,981
- I don't believe in prejudice.
- I see.

531
00:40:31,064 --> 00:40:33,358
Well, uh...

532
00:40:33,443 --> 00:40:35,527
...good evening.

533
00:40:46,242 --> 00:40:48,871
- Evening, Mr Green.
- Evening, Mr Olsen.

534
00:41:15,766 --> 00:41:21,895
Say, Mr Green, why not fill out one of them
cards at the post office, or tell the mailman?

535
00:41:21,978 --> 00:41:25,230
- What's the matter with this way?
- It's the rules.

536
00:41:26,065 --> 00:41:27,982
Leave that alone.

537
00:41:28,066 --> 00:41:30,402
It's nothing I can help. It's the rules.

538
00:41:30,486 --> 00:41:34,488
The renting agent should have explained.
That is, excuse me, if you are...

539
00:41:34,571 --> 00:41:39,407
Excuse me, nothing! This is my place
for two years, and don't touch that card.

540
00:41:53,418 --> 00:41:56,963
- You don't mean we're having dinner here?
- I do indeed.

541
00:41:58,297 --> 00:42:00,174
- So we can talk.
- Talk, huh?

542
00:42:00,257 --> 00:42:04,094
You sit there. I'm not going
to let you get going on another thing.

543
00:42:04,177 --> 00:42:08,471
You don't eat until you tell me the angle.
I've been trying to guess it all day long.

544
00:42:08,554 --> 00:42:10,306
- Have you really?
- Yes, I have.

545
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:14,810
I kept thinking "Suppose I were he
and I had to find an angle, what would I do?"

546
00:42:14,893 --> 00:42:18,437
- Well, what would you do?
- Well, I gotjust no place.

547
00:42:18,521 --> 00:42:22,482
Some ideas you told me were excellent,
but you threw them out and kept hunting.

548
00:42:22,565 --> 00:42:25,318
Now you'll see why, just as soon as I tell you.

549
00:42:25,735 --> 00:42:28,195
Phil, tell me.

550
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:31,196
All right. Here it is.

551
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:35,450
- I'm gonna let everybody know I'm Jewish.
- Jewish?

552
00:42:35,534 --> 00:42:39,578
But you're not, Phil, are you?
Not that it would make any difference to me.

553
00:42:39,662 --> 00:42:43,958
But you said "let everybody know"
as if you hadn't before and would now.

554
00:42:44,041 --> 00:42:47,750
So I just wondered. Not that it would
matter to me, one way or the other.

555
00:42:48,126 --> 00:42:51,753
- Phil, you're annoyed.
- No. I... I was just thinking.

556
00:42:51,838 --> 00:42:54,923
Don't be so serious about it.
You know where {y: I}I stand.

557
00:42:55,007 --> 00:42:59,010
- Oh, I do.
- It's just that you caught me off guard.

558
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:03,930
You know, not knowing much about you
because you make me talk about myself...

559
00:43:04,014 --> 00:43:07,850
...so that for a minute there
I wasn't very bright on the uptake.

560
00:43:07,933 --> 00:43:11,854
- Anyway, you don't think much of my angle?
- Oh, I do.

561
00:43:11,937 --> 00:43:13,604
It's...

562
00:43:13,687 --> 00:43:15,981
- It's what?
- It's just that I...

563
00:43:16,982 --> 00:43:21,152
I think it'll mix everybody up.
People won't know what you are.

564
00:43:22,403 --> 00:43:26,739
Of course, after the series is finished
they'll know, but it'll keep cropping up.

565
00:43:26,822 --> 00:43:28,906
All right.

566
00:43:30,157 --> 00:43:31,993
Let it.

567
00:43:32,076 --> 00:43:35,622
I must be out of my head.
"Let it" is right. Who cares?

568
00:43:35,705 --> 00:43:38,623
I was just being too practical about things.

569
00:43:39,581 --> 00:43:42,833
That's what comes
from being a schoolteacher.

570
00:43:42,917 --> 00:43:45,003
Now tell me more.

571
00:43:45,754 --> 00:43:51,716
Well, to begin with, you and the Minifys'll
have to promise not to give me away.

572
00:43:51,799 --> 00:43:54,968
- No exceptions for anything. OK?
- OK.

573
00:43:55,052 --> 00:43:59,431
- What about the people at Smith's?
- They're not in on it. Only Minify.

574
00:43:59,513 --> 00:44:03,558
- They think you're Jewish?
- Look, Kathy, I don't think you understand.

575
00:44:03,642 --> 00:44:09,271
If this is to work, the only chance is to go
whole hog. It's got to go through everything.

576
00:44:13,441 --> 00:44:15,651
Of course.

577
00:44:15,734 --> 00:44:18,236
I hadn't really seen it before.

578
00:44:20,738 --> 00:44:24,157
I didn't mean to be so sharp. I'm... I'm sorry.

579
00:44:28,369 --> 00:44:30,245
Dinner?

580
00:44:31,038 --> 00:44:32,539
Yeah, fine.

581
00:44:32,623 --> 00:44:35,500
You sit there. I'm doing the serving myself.

582
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:02,270
More coffee? Only take a minute to heat it.

583
00:45:02,353 --> 00:45:04,437
No, thanks.

584
00:45:12,193 --> 00:45:15,320
Oh, I... I think I'd better be getting along.

585
00:45:17,989 --> 00:45:20,240
So soon?

586
00:45:20,323 --> 00:45:23,994
Well, I should look in at Ma
before she gets to sleep.

587
00:45:24,077 --> 00:45:26,162
Of course.

588
00:45:28,956 --> 00:45:32,375
You have to get to the school
pretty early, don't you?

589
00:45:34,293 --> 00:45:36,170
Yes.

590
00:45:37,045 --> 00:45:41,216
I had a pretty full day at the magazine too.

591
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:44,175
Yes.

592
00:45:48,595 --> 00:45:50,848
It was a mighty fine dinner.

593
00:45:50,931 --> 00:45:55,143
I'm glad you liked it.
My car's downstairs. Let me run you home.

594
00:45:55,226 --> 00:45:58,144
Well, thanks. I think I'll walk.

595
00:45:58,811 --> 00:46:00,897
It's a lovely night.

596
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:06,984
Yes, it is.

597
00:46:08,276 --> 00:46:10,362
It's lovely.

598
00:46:15,032 --> 00:46:17,116
I'd better be getting off.

599
00:46:17,993 --> 00:46:21,745
- Oh, don't bother. I know where my hat is.
- It's no bother.

600
00:46:34,631 --> 00:46:37,759
- I'll call you sometime tomorrow.
- All right.

601
00:46:39,426 --> 00:46:41,927
- Good night.
- Good night, Phil.

602
00:46:58,439 --> 00:47:03,652
Mary said it'd be all right to bring you.
She's cooked a big dinner, so there's plenty...

603
00:47:22,166 --> 00:47:24,251
I forgot something.

604
00:47:30,172 --> 00:47:33,217
- Darling!
- Kathy, what am I doing to us?

605
00:47:33,299 --> 00:47:36,842
It's my fault. I'm always
weighing and judging. I'm such a fool.

606
00:47:36,926 --> 00:47:40,888
No, I should have said the angle was fine.
And it is. It's wonderful!

607
00:47:40,972 --> 00:47:44,684
I don't know what happened.
It started when you spoke. I felt insulted.

608
00:47:44,767 --> 00:47:48,978
If I were Jewish, that's how
I would've felt and I couldn't let you off.

609
00:47:49,061 --> 00:47:52,981
All through dinner I tried to reach you,
tell you I was sorry and I couldn't.

610
00:47:53,064 --> 00:47:58,026
I don't know what happened to me when you
told me, except that our evening was spoiled.

611
00:47:58,110 --> 00:48:00,612
- I wanted you to come back.
- Darling!

612
00:48:04,614 --> 00:48:10,244
But really, Mr Minify, I never make it a policy
just to hire... It's a question of personality.

613
00:48:10,327 --> 00:48:15,039
Please understand, Mr Minify. If a girl's
personality is the type that fits in...

614
00:48:15,123 --> 00:48:21,294
It's by chance that we haven't one secretary
named Finkelstein or Cohen? In New York?

615
00:48:21,377 --> 00:48:22,962
Come off it, Jordan!

616
00:48:23,045 --> 00:48:25,630
Miss Miller, take a "help wanted" ad.

617
00:48:25,714 --> 00:48:29,259
"Expert secretary for editorial department,
national magazine."

618
00:48:29,342 --> 00:48:33,469
"Exacting work. Religion is a matter
of indifference to this office." Got that?

619
00:48:33,553 --> 00:48:36,804
- Yes, Mr Minify.
- In any other ad you run, use that last line.

620
00:48:36,888 --> 00:48:40,349
That's all, Miss Miller.
Good afternoon, Jordan.

621
00:48:42,186 --> 00:48:47,147
By the way, if you should have to fire Miss
Wales for any reason whatever, at any time...

622
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:50,148
...remember I'd like to
review the case myself first.

623
00:48:50,231 --> 00:48:52,318
Good afternoon, Mr Minify.

624
00:48:56,530 --> 00:49:01,450
I'm ashamed of myself and the magazine. The
notion that everybody's doing bigger things.

625
00:49:01,533 --> 00:49:06,454
Well, nothing's bigger than beating down the
complacence of decent people on prejudice.

626
00:49:06,537 --> 00:49:09,788
Yes, sir, I'm ashamed of myself.
Go on back to work.

627
00:49:16,877 --> 00:49:20,714
I believe that I've given
an accurate picture of my qualifications...

628
00:49:20,797 --> 00:49:24,675
...and I would very much appreciate...

629
00:49:24,759 --> 00:49:28,260
...your immediate consideration and reply.
Sincerely yours.

630
00:49:28,344 --> 00:49:30,804
Ask for an immediate reply on all of them.

631
00:49:30,888 --> 00:49:34,725
Don't bother to do it today. It's too late.
Tomorrow'll be all right.

632
00:49:34,808 --> 00:49:39,604
Mr Green, when will you start dictating the
series itself? I'd like to get the decks cleared.

633
00:49:39,687 --> 00:49:45,315
I think I'll type it out myself to start with.
I'm not much good on dictating actual copy.

634
00:49:45,398 --> 00:49:49,152
Well, that'll be all, Miss Wales.
You'd better get along home.

635
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:51,320
All right.

636
00:49:51,987 --> 00:49:53,906
Mr Green...

637
00:49:53,989 --> 00:49:57,449
- Is it true about Mr Jordan?
- Is what true about Mr Jordan?

638
00:49:57,533 --> 00:50:03,539
Well, he's telling everybody about Mr Minify's
ad. He thinks it's a wonderful thing. He {y: I}says,

639
00:50:03,621 --> 00:50:05,164
He does, huh?

640
00:50:05,247 --> 00:50:08,501
I thought I'd ask you if it's true
that the ad says right out...

641
00:50:08,583 --> 00:50:13,379
Right straight out, Miss Wales.
It's gonna be in all the papers tomorrow.

642
00:50:13,462 --> 00:50:16,589
Practically inviting any type at all to apply?

643
00:50:16,673 --> 00:50:19,132
Any type? What do you mean?

644
00:50:19,216 --> 00:50:22,845
Mr Green, you don't want things
changed around here, do you?

645
00:50:23,135 --> 00:50:26,179
Although you are a writer.
And it's different for writers.

646
00:50:26,263 --> 00:50:28,348
Different for writers how?

647
00:50:28,431 --> 00:50:33,269
Well, I mean, just let them get one wrong one
in here and it'll come out of us.

648
00:50:33,352 --> 00:50:36,688
It's no fun being the fall guy
for the kikey ones.

649
00:50:37,563 --> 00:50:40,149
Now, look, Miss Wales...

650
00:50:40,232 --> 00:50:43,569
...we've gotta be frank.
You have a right to know right now...

651
00:50:43,652 --> 00:50:49,030
...that words like yid and kike and kikey
and nigger and coon make me kind of sick...

652
00:50:49,114 --> 00:50:52,533
...no matter who says them.
- But I only said it for a type.

653
00:50:52,616 --> 00:50:55,409
Yeah, but we're talking about a word first.

654
00:50:56,411 --> 00:50:59,580
But, Mr Green, that doesn't mean a thing.

655
00:50:59,663 --> 00:51:02,541
Sometimes I even say it to myself -
about me, I mean.

656
00:51:02,624 --> 00:51:09,044
Like if I'm about to do something and I know
I shouldn't, I say "Don't be such a little kike."

657
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:13,507
- But let one objectionable one get in...
- What do you mean by objectionable?

658
00:51:13,591 --> 00:51:15,550
Loud and too much rouge and...

659
00:51:15,633 --> 00:51:19,927
They don't hire any loud, vulgar girls here.
What makes you think they'll start?

660
00:51:20,137 --> 00:51:23,930
It's not only that.
Mr Green, you're sort of heckling me.

661
00:51:24,014 --> 00:51:30,354
You know the sort that starts trouble and
the sort that doesn't. So why pin me down?

662
00:51:30,562 --> 00:51:33,979
You mean because we don't look
especially Jewish? We're OK Jews?

663
00:51:34,062 --> 00:51:36,983
Because with us
it can be kept nice and quiet?

664
00:51:37,066 --> 00:51:40,403
- I didn't say...
- Listen, Miss Wales, I hate anti-Semitism.

665
00:51:40,736 --> 00:51:46,032
I hate it when it comes from you or any Jew,
as much as when it comes from a Gentile.

666
00:51:46,115 --> 00:51:48,032
Me? Why, Mr Green...

667
00:51:48,115 --> 00:51:50,410
See you tomorrow, Miss Wales.

668
00:51:51,076 --> 00:51:53,162
Good night.

669
00:52:06,379 --> 00:52:09,257
- Why don't you go home?
- I'm slowly going crazy!

670
00:52:09,341 --> 00:52:12,426
- Hi, there!
- Hello, Miss Dettrey.

671
00:52:12,510 --> 00:52:17,387
How can you stride down the hall with such
energy at the end of the day? I'm bushed.

672
00:52:17,471 --> 00:52:21,141
- Getting the book to bed is a nightmare.
- I didn't know you called it that.

673
00:52:21,225 --> 00:52:24,852
Oh, we do. We're sophisticated
New Yorkers, Mr Green.

674
00:52:24,936 --> 00:52:28,896
- Do you happen to be thirsty?
- I do, and I wanna hear the story of your life.

675
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:31,232
Why, Mr Green!

676
00:52:31,315 --> 00:52:34,234
I think it can be arranged.
If you play your cards right.

677
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:38,112
- Do you know a nice bar?
- This couldn't happen to a nicer girl.

678
00:52:39,071 --> 00:52:41,908
He liked it, and that's how
I got to be fashion editor.

679
00:52:41,991 --> 00:52:45,535
- Hello, Jim. How are you?
- Don't look now, but we've got visitors.

680
00:52:45,617 --> 00:52:47,828
Just when I was getting to the tender part.

681
00:52:47,911 --> 00:52:51,080
- Mind if I sit with you charming people?
- No. Sit down, Bert.

682
00:52:51,163 --> 00:52:55,459
Only got a minute. You two seemed
to be having such fun, I couldn't resist it.

683
00:52:55,543 --> 00:53:00,963
We love to spread merriment. Our hearts are
God's garden, with just an occasional weed.

684
00:53:01,046 --> 00:53:05,049
Well, Anne, another issue gone to press.
I don't see how we do it every week.

685
00:53:05,133 --> 00:53:10,886
We're just brilliant. Every day I ask the mirror
"Who is the most brilliant of them all?"

686
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:15,641
- And what does the mirror say?
- That mirror ain't no gentleman, Mr Green.

687
00:53:15,723 --> 00:53:20,186
- How's the series coming?
- I'm still gathering stuff. Plenty of it around.

688
00:53:20,270 --> 00:53:24,062
When I was stationed at Guam
our CO used to talk to us about it.

689
00:53:24,146 --> 00:53:26,065
Quite a liberal, that fellow.

690
00:53:26,149 --> 00:53:28,942
You were in public relations, weren't you?

691
00:53:30,277 --> 00:53:33,487
- What makes you say that?
- I don't know.

692
00:53:33,571 --> 00:53:37,074
You just seem like a clever sort of a guy.

693
00:53:38,449 --> 00:53:41,785
- What makes you think I wasn't a GI?
- Huh?

694
00:53:43,578 --> 00:53:47,873
Now, for goodness sake, Green, don't
get me wrong. Some of my best friends...

695
00:53:47,956 --> 00:53:51,792
I know, and your other best friends
are Methodists, but you never say it.

696
00:53:51,876 --> 00:53:54,462
- Now, look, Anne...
- Skip it.

697
00:53:54,545 --> 00:53:56,880
Flag the waiter, Phil, and be a dear.

698
00:53:58,632 --> 00:54:01,592
Well, if you'll excuse me, I've got to run.

699
00:54:01,675 --> 00:54:03,761
I'll be seeing you.

700
00:54:08,222 --> 00:54:10,182
Little drip.

701
00:54:10,265 --> 00:54:13,935
"Now, for goodness sake, Green,
don't get me wrong!"

702
00:54:14,019 --> 00:54:15,894
Really believes it too.

703
00:54:15,977 --> 00:54:21,439
Disapproves of the poll tax and Bilbo. Comes
right out and says so brave as anything.

704
00:54:21,522 --> 00:54:25,942
- He's just a drip, let's face it.
- That imitation was wonderful.

705
00:54:26,026 --> 00:54:28,279
Got a million. Well, we're back to laughs.

706
00:54:28,362 --> 00:54:32,325
Say, I'm having a flock of people up
tomorrow night. What about coming?

707
00:54:32,408 --> 00:54:36,284
- Sure, I'd like it fine. Can I bring my girl?
- Of course!

708
00:54:37,702 --> 00:54:40,370
- What'll you have, sir?
- More of the same.

709
00:54:51,254 --> 00:54:53,798
Wait here, will you? I'll be right back.

710
00:55:08,601 --> 00:55:11,019
- Surprise!
- Now that's what I call timing.

711
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:14,064
I saw your cab drive up. I just couldn't wait.

712
00:55:14,147 --> 00:55:16,231
<i>(appreciative whistle)</i>

713
00:55:17,732 --> 00:55:19,608
Oh, brother!

714
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:23,028
It's nothing. A lady comes in
twice a week and puts them up for me.

715
00:55:23,112 --> 00:55:26,114
Been with the family for generations.
Look at you!

716
00:55:26,197 --> 00:55:29,741
First time I've seen you in dinner clothes.
Good enough to eat.

717
00:55:29,825 --> 00:55:31,492
Come on, dear, let's go.

718
00:55:31,575 --> 00:55:33,869
Oh. I told Ma today all about us.

719
00:55:33,953 --> 00:55:38,081
- Phil, was she pleased?
- She was delighted. She got very emotional.

720
00:55:38,164 --> 00:55:41,209
She dropped and broke her best dish
and blamed it on Tommy!

721
00:55:41,292 --> 00:55:46,087
I called my sister Jane this morning,
blurted it out and she squealed "Kathy!"

722
00:55:46,170 --> 00:55:49,339
As if she'd given up hope
that anyone would ask me again.

723
00:55:49,423 --> 00:55:54,510
Oh, darling, she's aching to meet you. In fact,
they're giving a party for us next Saturday.

724
00:55:54,593 --> 00:55:57,845
- Won't we have to let Jane in on it?
- I hadn't thought.

725
00:55:57,928 --> 00:56:01,557
I hadn't either, until now.
But won't we? Your mother knows.

726
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:05,310
She had to. Jane and her husband don't.
If you wanna keep a secret...

727
00:56:05,394 --> 00:56:11,147
Wouldn't it be sort of exaggerated with
my own sister? Your sister-in-law almost?

728
00:56:11,230 --> 00:56:14,692
Darling, I do think
it would be inflexible of you.

729
00:56:14,775 --> 00:56:17,026
Well, I suppose it would.

730
00:56:17,110 --> 00:56:18,946
Inside the family.

731
00:56:19,029 --> 00:56:23,032
- They won't tell anybody else, will they?
- Oh, they'd never breathe it.

732
00:56:23,116 --> 00:56:26,993
They wanna fight this awful thing
as much as you and I do.

733
00:56:27,076 --> 00:56:29,911
Darling, I'll be the proudest girl on the block.

734
00:56:29,995 --> 00:56:34,207
I don't have to kiss you in public.
I've got a nice dark taxi outside.

735
00:56:34,291 --> 00:56:37,627
Well, what are we waiting for? Come on.

736
00:56:37,711 --> 00:56:39,710
Don't just stand there.

737
00:56:57,767 --> 00:57:00,185
- She is attractive.
- She looks beautiful.

738
00:57:00,268 --> 00:57:03,062
She certainly does. And she likes you a lot.

739
00:57:05,064 --> 00:57:09,149
- I'll scratch her eyes out if she goes after you.
- That's the way to talk.

740
00:57:09,232 --> 00:57:11,735
You haven't got a thing to worry about.

741
00:57:12,818 --> 00:57:13,944
Hello, Anne.

742
00:57:14,028 --> 00:57:18,073
Can I get you something? Food, drinks,
some spending money, an emerald?

743
00:57:18,156 --> 00:57:20,825
- Lovely party, Anne.
- Be better when it thins out.

744
00:57:20,909 --> 00:57:24,369
I think I can get Sascha to play
and Ethel to sing. Stick around.

745
00:57:24,453 --> 00:57:28,331
Professor Lieberman's here.
Would you and Kathy like to meet him?

746
00:57:28,414 --> 00:57:30,500
- I should say so.
- I'm scared.

747
00:57:30,583 --> 00:57:36,045
- What does one say to a famous physicist?
- Just "Hello, toots." He's a wonderful guy.

748
00:57:42,592 --> 00:57:46,178
I'm not happy till I'm out in my boat.
I bought myself a new one.

749
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:49,180
You ought to join me one day.
You look tired and drawn.

750
00:57:49,263 --> 00:57:50,722
- Say when.
- Well...

751
00:57:50,806 --> 00:57:54,059
Professor, two people wanna meet you,
but are scared.

752
00:57:54,142 --> 00:57:58,437
They'll introduce themselves. That'll
make them talk. You're on your own, kids.

753
00:57:58,521 --> 00:58:01,773
- Fine friend!
- Come on, Fred. I want them to be alone.

754
00:58:01,856 --> 00:58:04,649
- This is my fiance, Kathy Lacey.
- How do you do?

755
00:58:04,732 --> 00:58:08,361
I'm Phil Green. John Minify
has been wanting to get us together.

756
00:58:08,444 --> 00:58:09,903
Oh, yes, yes...

757
00:58:09,987 --> 00:58:12,657
- Yes! He told me he did.
- How do you do?

758
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:16,158
- I'm doing a series for him on anti-Semitism.
- For or against?

759
00:58:16,408 --> 00:58:19,537
Well, he thought that
we might hash over some ideas.

760
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:22,706
- What sort of ideas?
- Palestine. For instance, Zionism.

761
00:58:22,789 --> 00:58:28,126
Which? Palestine as a refuge or Zionism
as a movement for a Jewish state?

762
00:58:28,209 --> 00:58:32,295
- The confusion between the two.
- If we agree there's confusion, we can talk.

763
00:58:32,379 --> 00:58:37,633
We scientists love confusion. But right now
I'm starting on a new crusade of my own.

764
00:58:37,717 --> 00:58:41,303
You see, I have no religion,
so I'm not Jewish by religion.

765
00:58:41,386 --> 00:58:45,847
Further, I'm a scientist, so I must rely on
science that tells me I'm not Jewish by race...

766
00:58:45,930 --> 00:58:51,560
...since there's no such thing as a distinct
Jewish race. There's not even a Jewish type.

767
00:58:51,643 --> 00:58:57,690
Well, my crusade will have a certain charm.
I will simply go forth and state I'm not a Jew.

768
00:58:57,773 --> 00:59:02,819
With my face, that becomes not an evasion,
but a new principle. A scientific principle.

769
00:59:02,902 --> 00:59:05,028
- For a scientific age.
- Precisely.

770
00:59:05,404 --> 00:59:10,033
There must be millions of people nowadays
who are religious only in the vaguest sense.

771
00:59:10,116 --> 00:59:16,246
I've often wondered why the Jewish ones
among them still call themselves Jews.

772
00:59:16,329 --> 00:59:19,581
- Can you guess why, Mr Green?
- No, but I'd like to know.

773
00:59:19,665 --> 00:59:24,126
Because the world still makes it
an advantage not to be one.

774
00:59:24,209 --> 00:59:28,837
Thus, for many of us, it becomes a matter
of pride to go on calling ourselves Jews.

775
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:33,299
So, you see, I will have to abandon
my crusade before it begins.

776
00:59:33,382 --> 00:59:37,053
Only if there were no anti-Semites
could I go on with it.

777
00:59:37,136 --> 00:59:41,222
And now I would like to try
another little scientific experiment.

778
00:59:41,306 --> 00:59:45,559
I wonder whether you would leave me alone
with your very beautiful fiance...

779
00:59:45,642 --> 00:59:48,103
...while you got me a plate of food.
- Well...

780
00:59:48,186 --> 00:59:52,022
- Both in the interests of science.
- Anything for science, Professor.

781
00:59:52,105 --> 00:59:54,316
I'm John Minify's niece, Kathy Lacey.

782
00:59:54,857 --> 00:59:56,858
And a little onion.

783
00:59:56,941 --> 00:59:59,695
- There. Now go play with that, Fred.
- Thank you.

784
00:59:59,779 --> 01:00:02,739
This is not my third trip round,
it's for Lieberman.

785
01:00:02,823 --> 01:00:06,409
- Who's counting? I'll fix him some caviar.
- Caviar?

786
01:00:06,493 --> 01:00:08,951
It's all deductible from my income tax, dear.

787
01:00:09,035 --> 01:00:11,745
I have to give parties
to see what women wear. Get it?

788
01:00:11,828 --> 01:00:14,039
- You old crook.
- Young crook, please!

789
01:00:14,122 --> 01:00:18,584
- OK. How do you like my girl?
- She's lovely.

790
01:00:18,667 --> 01:00:23,712
- Is it serious orjust the first rapture?
- It's serious. We'll be married any minute.

791
01:00:23,796 --> 01:00:28,092
My congratulations, you wilful,
headstrong fellow. When did this happen?

792
01:00:28,175 --> 01:00:31,886
First time we looked at each other, I guess.
Third day I came to New York.

793
01:00:31,969 --> 01:00:35,429
- Tall buildings and traffic didn't scare you?
- Not a bit.

794
01:00:35,513 --> 01:00:39,475
I brushed the hay and straw out of my hair
and fell in love with a city girl.

795
01:00:39,558 --> 01:00:42,852
<i>You could crawl right into
The Saturday Evening Post,</i>

796
01:00:42,936 --> 01:00:46,189
- Have you met her sister and the rest?
- Not yet. You know them?

797
01:00:46,272 --> 01:00:48,856
Slightly. You're gonna meet them soon?

798
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:53,610
- Next week, I think. Why?
- Oh, I'd like the newsreel rights, that's all.

799
01:00:53,694 --> 01:00:56,654
- Why? What's the matter with them?
- Nothing.

800
01:00:56,737 --> 01:01:02,742
I just think it's a fine idea to meet the family
first. It saves wear and tear afterwards.

801
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:20,422
- Nice party.
- It's even nicer here.

802
01:01:26,678 --> 01:01:32,431
I've been thinking maybe it would be better
if... if you didn't tell your sister after all, huh?

803
01:01:32,514 --> 01:01:35,976
- Not tell her? Why?
- Well, the whole business depends on...

804
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:39,270
...my not making loopholes
whenever it's convenient.

805
01:01:39,353 --> 01:01:41,480
I've already told her.

806
01:01:41,564 --> 01:01:44,275
- You did? When?
- Tonight. I called her from Anne's.

807
01:01:44,357 --> 01:01:47,525
Jane insisted I let her know
the minute you said you'd be free.

808
01:01:47,608 --> 01:01:51,404
You know it takes time
to make arrangements for a big party.

809
01:01:52,446 --> 01:01:56,533
- What'd she say when you told her?
- She thought it the cleverest thing on earth.

810
01:01:56,616 --> 01:01:59,785
You'll love her. And Harry too.
They're grand people.

811
01:01:59,869 --> 01:02:04,497
- But she promised?
- I wouldn't tell her until she had. And Harry.

812
01:02:04,581 --> 01:02:09,335
She just asked that you skip the whole thing
for the party, not bring it up. And I said...

813
01:02:09,418 --> 01:02:11,294
- You said no.
- What?

814
01:02:11,377 --> 01:02:15,296
- You said "No, he won't skip it for the party."
- No, I didn't.

815
01:02:16,005 --> 01:02:18,091
I said I'd ask you.

816
01:02:18,175 --> 01:02:21,134
I'd never say yes without asking you.

817
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:25,763
- You mean you think I should?
- Oh, darling...

818
01:02:25,846 --> 01:02:29,682
...why do you lose your sense of proportion
whenever the subject comes up?

819
01:02:29,766 --> 01:02:32,226
That's what was wonderful about Lieberman.

820
01:02:32,310 --> 01:02:36,897
He feels the problem as deeply as anyone
else, yet he had a sense of humour about it.

821
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:41,734
And besides, you know those suburban
groups - Connecticut, Darien, up there.

822
01:02:41,817 --> 01:02:44,736
It would start a mess
for Jane and Harry for nothing.

823
01:02:44,819 --> 01:02:47,112
And if it were a mess for something?

824
01:02:48,238 --> 01:02:53,409
But, Phil, you're not Jewish. It'd just ruin
the party for Jane if she had problems with it.

825
01:02:53,493 --> 01:02:57,828
Why can't I make you see that?
I know I promised. No exceptions.

826
01:02:57,912 --> 01:03:00,539
You were being reasonable
to stretch it to Jane.

827
01:03:00,623 --> 01:03:04,584
But itjust seems so silly to start a thing
for her up there when it's not true.

828
01:03:04,668 --> 01:03:08,003
Why not tell Jane just to call off the party?

829
01:03:08,087 --> 01:03:12,130
Well, it would seem so queer,
her only sister getting married.

830
01:03:12,214 --> 01:03:14,926
- And if you were, I'd manage.
- Thanks(!)

831
01:03:15,634 --> 01:03:18,803
Phil, I'm not asking you
to make loopholes where it counts -

832
01:03:18,886 --> 01:03:21,597
at the office and
meeting people like at Anne's.

833
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:26,768
But to go to Connecticut to a party, and if we
were to use my house... And Jane and Harry...

834
01:03:26,851 --> 01:03:29,353
- I thought you said they were grand.
- They are!

835
01:03:29,436 --> 01:03:33,189
But they can't help it if some
of their friends are... It would make a...

836
01:03:33,272 --> 01:03:35,899
- A mess, an inconvenience.
- Well, it would!

837
01:03:35,983 --> 01:03:41,237
- Just for Jane and Harry, or for you too?
- I'd be so tense, I wouldn't have fun either!

838
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:45,615
Oh, Phil, if everything's going
to be so tensed up and solemn, I...

839
01:03:48,659 --> 01:03:50,743
I think I'd better go now.

840
01:04:10,383 --> 01:04:14,971
- {y: I}(Mrs Green) Wake him up. Tell him to hurry.
- Don't worry, I'll get him!

841
01:04:18,557 --> 01:04:20,224
Pop!

842
01:04:20,724 --> 01:04:22,810
Pop, get up. It's for you.

843
01:04:25,103 --> 01:04:27,355
- Grandma said to wake you.
- {y: I}(groans)

844
01:04:27,439 --> 01:04:29,523
Hello. It's for you.

845
01:04:30,399 --> 01:04:33,401
- Telephone.
- OK.

846
01:04:35,027 --> 01:04:37,112
Get up!

847
01:04:38,238 --> 01:04:40,655
- Late, isn't it?
- Mm-hm.

848
01:04:40,739 --> 01:04:43,367
- Here's your bathrobe.
- I don't want it.

849
01:04:43,451 --> 01:04:45,952
I said put it on.

850
01:04:47,620 --> 01:04:49,704
Hey, Pop! Here are your slippers.

851
01:04:50,998 --> 01:04:53,082
Finally roused him.

852
01:04:57,086 --> 01:04:59,169
Hello.

853
01:04:59,336 --> 01:05:00,755
Dave?

854
01:05:00,838 --> 01:05:03,381
Dave! Where are you? When'd you get in?

855
01:05:03,465 --> 01:05:06,176
It's Dave! This is wonderful. Where are you?

856
01:05:06,259 --> 01:05:07,801
<i>(chuckles)</i>

857
01:05:07,885 --> 01:05:08,927
LaGuardia.

858
01:05:09,011 --> 01:05:12,847
Just now. I had a break
and got assigned to a plane with my CO.

859
01:05:12,930 --> 01:05:17,975
- And I haven't had brea{y: I}kfast. Get it?
- Well, grab a cab and get right over here.

860
01:05:18,644 --> 01:05:19,561
OK.

861
01:05:19,645 --> 01:05:22,520
Hey, Ma! Can you make
some of your famous hot cakes?

862
01:05:22,604 --> 01:05:26,358
- We used to eat a stack apiece.
- I guess the old magic still works.

863
01:05:26,441 --> 01:05:31,027
- Can I have some too, Grandma?
- How many brea{y: I}kfasts can you eat in a day?

864
01:05:31,110 --> 01:05:34,405
- OK. I never have any fun.
- You'll be late for school.

865
01:05:34,489 --> 01:05:37,449
I know what time school starts.
And I don't like fruit.

866
01:05:37,532 --> 01:05:41,661
- You like bananas, don't you?
- Well, bananas are different.

867
01:05:42,161 --> 01:05:44,245
<i>(shower running)</i>

868
01:05:45,121 --> 01:05:47,748
Say, Pop, are we Jewish?

869
01:05:49,249 --> 01:05:52,836
Jimmy Kelly said we were.
Our janitor told his janitor.

870
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:56,672
- What'd you say to Jimmy Kelly?
- I told him I'd ask you.

871
01:05:58,298 --> 01:06:01,300
- Remember that movie we saw with Kathy?
- Sure.

872
01:06:01,384 --> 01:06:05,513
- You asked if things like that happened.
- Kathy said they were pretending.

873
01:06:05,596 --> 01:06:09,222
Well, I'm pretending to be Jewish
for something I'm writing now.

874
01:06:09,306 --> 01:06:12,850
- Oh, you mean like a movie or a game.
- Something like that.

875
01:06:12,934 --> 01:06:16,896
Look, Tom. I'd like you to promise
not to tell anybody it's a game.

876
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:19,856
- OK, sure.
- What'll you tell Jimmy, Tom?

877
01:06:19,940 --> 01:06:23,609
- Oh, I'll say I haven't any information.
- Wait a minute.

878
01:06:23,693 --> 01:06:27,320
Maybe that's not such a good idea,
to say you haven't any information.

879
01:06:27,403 --> 01:06:31,573
Maybe you'd better say that you asked me
and I said I {y: I}was partly Jewish. OK?

880
01:06:31,657 --> 01:06:34,367
OK. But not tell him it's the movie part.

881
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:52,047
- Have some more, Dave?
- Doctor, please! You're hittin' a nerve.

882
01:06:52,131 --> 01:06:57,218
Good. I'll go do my marketing. You two hogs
can pile the dishes in the sink while I'm gone.

883
01:06:57,302 --> 01:07:01,597
Dave, it's wonderful. Might you really bring
Carol and the kids to live in New York?

884
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:04,388
- We could all be together.
- That's the plan.

885
01:07:04,471 --> 01:07:08,017
I can be eastern representative of the firm.
Best break I ever had.

886
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:10,270
All depends if I can find a place to live.

887
01:07:10,353 --> 01:07:14,815
I'll spend my terminal leave looking for
a place big enough for Carol and the kids.

888
01:07:14,898 --> 01:07:18,274
- We'll find you something.
- Meantime you'll stay here.

889
01:07:18,357 --> 01:07:20,402
Tommy can sleep in the living room.

890
01:07:20,485 --> 01:07:23,863
- Wait a minute.
- No arguments. You're talking to a civilian.

891
01:07:23,947 --> 01:07:28,491
You win. My CO had to move in with an uncle
he hasn't seen since the First World War.

892
01:07:28,575 --> 01:07:31,827
- I'll help with the cooking.
- Not while I'm conscious.

893
01:07:31,911 --> 01:07:36,914
Goodbye, boys. Don't settle all the problems
today. Save some for tomorrow.

894
01:07:39,291 --> 01:07:41,375
Boy, I'm loaded!

895
01:07:41,834 --> 01:07:44,545
You know, I used to dream
about doin' this, Phil.

896
01:07:44,629 --> 01:07:48,757
What about this series you're doin'?
I've talked about myself enough.

897
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:51,549
- Come on. Give.
- Oh, we'll get to it later.

898
01:07:55,261 --> 01:07:57,805
- What's eating you, Phil?
- Who, me?

899
01:07:58,723 --> 01:08:03,768
You expecting a call? You keep looking out
toward the phone every few minutes.

900
01:08:05,936 --> 01:08:08,021
It's that obvious?

901
01:08:08,438 --> 01:08:11,732
Oh, I... I had a scrap with my girl.

902
01:08:12,691 --> 01:08:15,318
I guess I wanted her to be the one to phone.

903
01:08:16,193 --> 01:08:18,153
That's another department.

904
01:08:18,237 --> 01:08:22,407
I'm doing a series on anti-Semitism.
With a special angle.

905
01:08:22,491 --> 01:08:24,575
- That's interesting.
- Interesting?

906
01:08:24,659 --> 01:08:27,785
Don't you want a good, stiff series
in a national magazine?

907
01:08:27,868 --> 01:08:30,621
- Me? Sure.
- You sound bored.

908
01:08:32,206 --> 01:08:34,290
Oh, I'm anything but.

909
01:08:34,374 --> 01:08:40,504
It's just that... well, I'm on the sidelines
in anti-Semitism. It's your fight, brother.

910
01:08:40,587 --> 01:08:42,671
OK. I get it.

911
01:08:42,754 --> 01:08:48,510
Listen, I don't care about the Jews as Jews.
It's the whole thing. Not the poor, poor Jews.

912
01:08:48,593 --> 01:08:51,679
You know what I mean.
Don't force me to use big words.

913
01:08:51,762 --> 01:08:54,931
Anyway, what's this
special angle you've got?

914
01:08:56,557 --> 01:08:58,642
I've been doing it for a while.

915
01:08:59,810 --> 01:09:03,312
I'm saying I'm Jewish. And it works.

916
01:09:04,437 --> 01:09:06,691
Why, you fool.

917
01:09:06,774 --> 01:09:08,858
You crazy fool!

918
01:09:10,484 --> 01:09:13,778
- And it's working?
- It works. It works too well.

919
01:09:13,861 --> 01:09:16,906
I've had my nose rubbed in it
and I don't like the smell.

920
01:09:16,990 --> 01:09:19,449
Yeah. I can guess.

921
01:09:20,451 --> 01:09:22,536
You're not insulated yet, Phil.

922
01:09:22,619 --> 01:09:27,539
It's new every time, so the impact
must be quite a business on you.

923
01:09:27,622 --> 01:09:29,541
You get indifferent to it in time?

924
01:09:29,624 --> 01:09:33,084
No, but you're concentrating
a lifetime thing into a few weeks.

925
01:09:33,167 --> 01:09:36,087
You make the thing happen
every day, go out to meet it.

926
01:09:36,170 --> 01:09:41,716
The facts are no different, Phil.
It just telescopes it. Makes it hurt more.

927
01:09:41,799 --> 01:09:43,886
<i>(phone)</i>

928
01:09:46,136 --> 01:09:48,222
Hello?

929
01:09:49,431 --> 01:09:51,514
No. Sorry.

930
01:09:59,980 --> 01:10:03,650
- Wrong number.
- You wanna talk about it?

931
01:10:03,734 --> 01:10:05,901
No. It's just one of those things.

932
01:10:05,984 --> 01:10:11,865
I'm probably wiser staying alone. After seven
years, you lose the instinct for marriage.

933
01:10:11,948 --> 01:10:14,033
Baloney!

934
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:18,036
Do you and Carol ever
get off on tangents much?

935
01:10:18,119 --> 01:10:21,997
Who doesn't?
Go on and call her, you big dope.

936
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:26,209
So you're right and she's wrong. So what?
So she has to telephone you first?

937
01:10:26,292 --> 01:10:28,710
Who makes such rules? The Supreme Court?

938
01:10:28,793 --> 01:10:32,172
Go on and call her
and stop lickin' your wounds.

939
01:10:32,255 --> 01:10:36,382
Listen. Meet me at the office
between 5.30 and 6. I'll phone her.

940
01:10:36,466 --> 01:10:39,593
I'll get Anne Dettrey from the office.
We'll celebrate!

941
01:10:39,676 --> 01:10:40,720
OK!

942
01:10:40,803 --> 01:10:45,264
Can you imagine? Me married again,
you and Carol here, all of us together?

943
01:10:45,349 --> 01:10:50,560
First I've gotta imagine a roof over Carol's
head. I'm gonna start lookin' right away.

944
01:10:57,106 --> 01:11:00,984
- How long do we have to wait?
- I'll tell you as soon as your table is ready.

945
01:11:01,068 --> 01:11:04,195
- Other people haven't had to wait.
- They had reservations.

946
01:11:04,278 --> 01:11:06,738
- Who do you have to know to get one?
- Me, madam.

947
01:11:06,821 --> 01:11:11,117
Oh, Captain, I'm expecting a call here.
Will you call me when it comes?

948
01:11:11,201 --> 01:11:12,619
- Your name, sir?
- Phil Green.

949
01:11:12,702 --> 01:11:14,619
- Yes, sir.
- Thanks.

950
01:11:15,245 --> 01:11:20,666
<i>(Dave) Ever been to Paris? There's a lovely
restaurant on the Boulevard Montparnasse...</i>

951
01:11:20,749 --> 01:11:24,336
...and we had delicious pressed duck.
- Anyone we know?

952
01:11:25,086 --> 01:11:28,337
Know what I'm having?
More fun than you can shake a stick at.

953
01:11:28,420 --> 01:11:31,382
You want me to have the waiter
bring a stick for a test?

954
01:11:31,465 --> 01:11:33,926
No, thanks. None of those things work for me.

955
01:11:34,009 --> 01:11:37,720
Once I tried to let a smile
be my umbrella. I got awful wet.

956
01:11:37,804 --> 01:11:42,348
Another time I kept a stiff upper lip
for a week. People thought I'd had a face-lift.

957
01:11:42,431 --> 01:11:46,601
Tell me, gentlemen. Why is it that every man
who seems attractive these days...

958
01:11:46,685 --> 01:11:49,522
...is either married or barred on a technicality?

959
01:11:49,605 --> 01:11:53,274
Your timing is rotten
but your instincts are just great.

960
01:11:54,317 --> 01:11:57,402
- Here's to my instincts!
- Pardon me.

961
01:11:57,902 --> 01:11:59,987
Oh, pardon me.

962
01:12:00,821 --> 01:12:04,157
You know, I don't like officers.

963
01:12:04,824 --> 01:12:07,870
Well, neither do I. I don't blame ya.

964
01:12:09,328 --> 01:12:13,831
- What's your name, bud?
- Dave. Dave Goldman. What's yours?

965
01:12:13,914 --> 01:12:17,710
Never mind what my name is.
I told you I don't like officers.

966
01:12:17,793 --> 01:12:20,335
I especially don't like them if they're yids.

967
01:12:26,799 --> 01:12:30,970
Sorry, sir. He's terrible when
he gets all tanked up. Sorry.

968
01:12:31,387 --> 01:12:34,054
What's the matter with you, anyway?

969
01:12:34,138 --> 01:12:36,224
Let's take a walk.

970
01:12:44,478 --> 01:12:46,564
Come on. Sit down.

971
01:12:46,898 --> 01:12:51,485
- Take it easy, boy.
- I'm so sorry, sir. He won't bother you again.

972
01:12:51,568 --> 01:12:55,946
I was just coming over to tell you there's
a call for you. Telephone, Mr Green. A lady.

973
01:12:56,030 --> 01:12:58,114
Oh. Thanks.

974
01:13:00,408 --> 01:13:02,493
Come on. Let's eat, Anne.

975
01:13:08,872 --> 01:13:10,540
You have a call for Mr Green?

976
01:13:10,624 --> 01:13:12,708
Yeah.

977
01:13:13,584 --> 01:13:16,128
Hello. Kathy? Where are you?

978
01:13:16,420 --> 01:13:20,547
I'm up at Jane's. I came up
to have it out with her.

979
01:13:20,631 --> 01:13:24,426
I couldn't call you until I'd fixed
things up. Darling, I was wonderful.

980
01:13:24,510 --> 01:13:28,513
I said all the things you'd have wanted me to.
You would have been proud of me.

981
01:13:28,596 --> 01:13:32,140
Why can I be clear to Jane and Harry
when it's you I want to be clear with?

982
01:13:32,516 --> 01:13:37,268
I told you, baby. Sometimes I can be such
a solemn fool, I'm hard to get along with.

983
01:13:37,352 --> 01:13:41,439
The party's tomorrow.
Will you take the three o'clock train?

984
01:13:41,523 --> 01:13:44,191
I'll be waiting for you at the station.

985
01:13:44,274 --> 01:13:47,610
Oh, darling, I can breathe again
now that I've talked with you.

986
01:13:47,693 --> 01:13:50,111
And I can scarcely wait until tomorrow.

987
01:13:50,195 --> 01:13:53,447
Good night, baby. Oh, Kathy...

988
01:13:53,531 --> 01:13:57,535
- I love you, darling.
- And I love you. More than ever.

989
01:13:58,451 --> 01:14:00,537
Goodbye.

990
01:14:18,883 --> 01:14:21,386
Welcome to Darien! How are you?

991
01:14:30,892 --> 01:14:33,769
Oh, hurry, Harris. We're all parched.

992
01:14:34,770 --> 01:14:37,189
Your mother must be
so proud of you, Mr Green.

993
01:14:37,273 --> 01:14:38,773
Well, I hope so.

994
01:14:38,857 --> 01:14:42,735
- Are you enjoying yourself, Phil?
- Oh, having a fine time. Uh, Jane...

995
01:14:42,819 --> 01:14:45,528
Does your motherjust adore
everything you write?

996
01:14:45,611 --> 01:14:49,698
- Not everything. No, not exactly.
- She must.

997
01:14:49,781 --> 01:14:52,492
- Some people have all the luck.
- Yes, he's... nice.

998
01:14:52,576 --> 01:14:58,996
If I thought there were any more I'd go up into
the hills and catch him with my bare hands.

999
01:14:59,079 --> 01:15:02,541
- He's divine. How long was he around loose?
- Oh, about three days.

1000
01:15:02,624 --> 01:15:04,125
Mind if I steal Kathy away?

1001
01:15:04,208 --> 01:15:06,378
- Jane, you look beautiful.
- So do you.

1002
01:15:06,462 --> 01:15:08,879
- Wonderful party.
- It's going beautifully.

1003
01:15:08,962 --> 01:15:11,423
- Where are the Bascoms?
- Oh, didn't I tell you?

1004
01:15:11,506 --> 01:15:16,302
Joe called and said he had that dreadful
arthritis of his. They said they were so sorry.

1005
01:15:16,385 --> 01:15:18,888
Are the Howards and
the Berlicks coming later?

1006
01:15:18,971 --> 01:15:23,933
Um, no. They all decided to go to Hot Springs
at the last moment. I thought I mentioned it.

1007
01:15:24,017 --> 01:15:28,019
Jane, dear, I'm in this just as deeply as Phil.
I feel as strongly as he does.

1008
01:15:28,102 --> 01:15:30,854
- Darling! What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.

1009
01:15:30,937 --> 01:15:34,065
Just a little careful screening?
Just the safe ones?

1010
01:15:34,149 --> 01:15:36,900
Darling, you're getting
hipped on this series too.

1011
01:15:36,983 --> 01:15:41,236
Mr Green, tell me. Do you get
your ideas first and then write?

1012
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:44,448
Or do you write first and then get your ideas?

1013
01:15:45,115 --> 01:15:48,285
Well, I'm afraid I don't quite
understand what you mean.

1014
01:15:48,368 --> 01:15:53,621
Excuse me. Darling, I'm afraid I have to
spirit you away. Will you excuse us?

1015
01:15:53,704 --> 01:15:57,166
Why, certainly, my dear.
You make such a charming couple.

1016
01:15:57,249 --> 01:15:59,959
- We all wish you great happiness.
- Thank you.

1017
01:16:00,043 --> 01:16:01,961
We'll be right back.

1018
01:16:04,713 --> 01:16:06,173
- Kathy!
- Jane.

1019
01:16:06,256 --> 01:16:11,051
- Kathy, wait a minute. Where are you going?
- Phil and I are disappearing for a minute.

1020
01:16:11,134 --> 01:16:14,513
I want to show him the house.
And we both need a breather.

1021
01:16:14,596 --> 01:16:17,807
Give us all a chance to talk
about Phil without whispering.

1022
01:16:17,890 --> 01:16:21,934
- He's won everyone. Has it been awful, Phil?
- No. I'm coming back for more.

1023
01:16:22,017 --> 01:16:25,813
Good boy! Harry says this sort of thing
is a kind of mental bankruptcy.

1024
01:16:25,896 --> 01:16:29,816
- But we women love it. Don't we, Kathy?
- We certainly do. Come on, darling.

1025
01:16:29,899 --> 01:16:31,983
- See you later.
- Goodbye.

1026
01:16:38,364 --> 01:16:41,990
I feel pretty much of a fool
over the fuss I kicked up beforehand.

1027
01:16:42,074 --> 01:16:47,454
Why did Jane ask me to lay off for the party?
They all asked about the series. It was fine.

1028
01:16:47,538 --> 01:16:50,039
Not one lifted eyebrow in the bunch.

1029
01:16:52,415 --> 01:16:58,753
- Hey, Miss Lacey, you're not even listening.
- I was thinking about how wonderful you are.

1030
01:16:58,837 --> 01:17:00,923
Darling, there it is.

1031
01:17:21,020 --> 01:17:24,190
Aren't you supposed to
carry me across the threshold?

1032
01:17:24,274 --> 01:17:29,653
That's only if you refuse to marry me,
in which case I take you and throw you in.

1033
01:18:41,456 --> 01:18:44,666
It's lovely. It has a...

1034
01:18:45,168 --> 01:18:47,585
...kind of quiet all its own.

1035
01:18:47,668 --> 01:18:50,797
- Did you do it all yourself?
- Every bit of it.

1036
01:19:01,846 --> 01:19:04,015
We can redo the nursery.

1037
01:19:04,099 --> 01:19:07,142
That was when Bill and I
hoped we'd have a child.

1038
01:19:07,226 --> 01:19:09,310
It could be Tom's room.

1039
01:19:09,894 --> 01:19:13,856
- Will he like the country, Phil?
- Oh, he'll be crazy about it.

1040
01:19:14,481 --> 01:19:18,944
- Did you and Bill live here long?
- Bill and I have never lived here.

1041
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:22,319
Never? Why not?

1042
01:19:22,403 --> 01:19:24,822
Well, it's hard to explain.

1043
01:19:24,905 --> 01:19:27,407
I love this house, deeply.

1044
01:19:28,617 --> 01:19:33,913
And I started to build it when things first
began to go wrong between Bill and me.

1045
01:19:33,996 --> 01:19:38,999
And... somehow it became
a symbol to me of many things.

1046
01:19:40,792 --> 01:19:46,004
When you're troubled and hurt, you pour
yourself into things that can't hurt back.

1047
01:19:47,673 --> 01:19:52,051
- Can you understand that?
- Sure. I've done it myself at work.

1048
01:19:52,968 --> 01:19:55,803
Well, I poured all my hopes into this place.

1049
01:19:56,637 --> 01:20:01,642
And when it was finished, I somehow
knew that Bill and I were finished.

1050
01:20:03,935 --> 01:20:08,230
I knew I couldn't live here
with someone I didn't really love.

1051
01:20:08,313 --> 01:20:11,566
It was always more than just
a house to me, a place I owned.

1052
01:20:11,649 --> 01:20:14,151
It meant everything I hoped for.

1053
01:20:16,278 --> 01:20:19,279
Marriage, children, good life.

1054
01:20:20,905 --> 01:20:24,783
I knew I couldn't live here alone.
I knew that for sure.

1055
01:20:24,867 --> 01:20:28,078
- And you never lived here at all?
- No, never. No one has.

1056
01:20:28,162 --> 01:20:33,123
I stay at Jane's and come down here and walk
through the house, poke the curtains a bit.

1057
01:20:33,206 --> 01:20:34,915
Sit out here.

1058
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:38,044
And for a long while I hated it. Really hated it.

1059
01:20:41,130 --> 01:20:43,214
But I could never let it go.

1060
01:20:46,175 --> 01:20:48,259
And now I know why.

1061
01:20:49,427 --> 01:20:55,266
I was right not to settle for second best, right
to keep hoping, because it's all come true.

1062
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:59,435
Darling, you and I
are going to be so happy here.

1063
01:21:01,478 --> 01:21:04,814
This house and I... we were waiting for you.

1064
01:21:06,815 --> 01:21:09,318
I was always waiting for you, I think.

1065
01:21:14,571 --> 01:21:16,530
Coffee, coffee, coffee!

1066
01:21:16,614 --> 01:21:19,241
Anne, will you bring
the cream? And the mints?

1067
01:21:19,325 --> 01:21:21,409
- Mints? Where?
- Right there.

1068
01:21:21,493 --> 01:21:24,287
- How do you want your coffee, Dave? Black?
- Fine.

1069
01:21:24,371 --> 01:21:27,705
Why don't you play that piece, dear?
Make it a perfect evening.

1070
01:21:27,789 --> 01:21:31,250
- She plays beautifully.
- Darling, you keep on thinking that.

1071
01:21:31,334 --> 01:21:33,211
Anne, would you put the radio on?

1072
01:21:33,294 --> 01:21:36,338
You know, Anne, these two act
like an old married couple.

1073
01:21:36,421 --> 01:21:39,882
- Two days before the wedding, it's indecent.
- And depressing.

1074
01:21:39,965 --> 01:21:42,133
Give a nervous flutter or two, Kathy...

1075
01:21:42,217 --> 01:21:45,303
...or the bellboys won'tjoke
as they carry up your bags.

1076
01:21:45,387 --> 01:21:47,846
- Is the honeymoon place a secret?
- Big secret.

1077
01:21:47,930 --> 01:21:50,933
- It's the White Mountains.
- Don't tell him. He's nosy.

1078
01:21:51,015 --> 01:21:54,810
Liable to turn up at odd hours,
pretending he's the house detective.

1079
01:21:54,893 --> 01:21:58,646
I'd love that. I've always wanted
to tell a house detective what for.

1080
01:21:58,729 --> 01:22:04,651
- We're going to Flume Inn. Do you know it?
- What? Flume Inn? On your honeymoon?

1081
01:22:04,734 --> 01:22:07,320
- You wouldn't. You're kidding.
- No, we're not.

1082
01:22:07,404 --> 01:22:12,115
- What's the matter with Flume Inn?
- It's restricted, that's all.

1083
01:22:12,198 --> 01:22:13,991
Restricted?

1084
01:22:14,075 --> 01:22:19,287
- Darling, I'm sorry. I didn't realise.
- That's all right, baby. It's not your fault.

1085
01:22:21,622 --> 01:22:25,165
- So that's how it is.
- Are you sure? Were you there recently?

1086
01:22:25,249 --> 01:22:28,919
- No. And I'm sure.
- But they confirmed the reservation.

1087
01:22:29,002 --> 01:22:32,839
- Darling, we can open the cottage.
- Oh, sure. You can always go somewhere.

1088
01:22:32,922 --> 01:22:35,799
- {y: I}(phone)
- Those nasty little snobs aren't worth it.

1089
01:22:35,882 --> 01:22:38,009
There must be something I can do.

1090
01:22:38,092 --> 01:22:43,179
You can't pin 'em down, Phil. They never
say straight out or put it in writing.

1091
01:22:43,263 --> 01:22:46,933
- They'll worm out of it one way or another.
- Phil.

1092
01:22:47,308 --> 01:22:50,269
It's Tom. He wants you. He sounds frightened.

1093
01:22:53,020 --> 01:22:55,106
Hello, Tom. What's up?

1094
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:57,315
What?

1095
01:22:57,898 --> 01:23:02,570
There's a bottle of medicine in the cabinet.
Give some to Grandma right away.

1096
01:23:02,653 --> 01:23:04,405
- I'll be right there.
- What is it?

1097
01:23:04,487 --> 01:23:09,159
- Sounds like a stroke.
- Look up Dr Abrahams. Ask him to get there.

1098
01:23:09,242 --> 01:23:10,617
JE Abrahams.

1099
01:23:10,701 --> 01:23:12,785
I'm going with you.

1100
01:23:18,915 --> 01:23:21,000
- Tsk, tsk, tsk...
- Hm?

1101
01:23:23,627 --> 01:23:28,423
She is magnificent. Never complains. Just
worries about my school if I'm here all day.

1102
01:23:28,506 --> 01:23:33,426
- Maybe we ought to hire a part-time maid.
- Dry dishes with your mouth shut. It's faster.

1103
01:23:33,509 --> 01:23:37,220
Cheer up. Postponing a wedding
isn't the worst thing in the world.

1104
01:23:37,305 --> 01:23:42,809
- Just a week, two at most, Abrahams said.
- I'm afraid I won't be here for it.

1105
01:23:42,892 --> 01:23:45,267
What?! Why, Dave, you've got to be.

1106
01:23:45,351 --> 01:23:48,604
- We couldn't get married without you.
- Why? What happened?

1107
01:23:48,687 --> 01:23:53,358
Nothing. That's just it. I can't abandon
my family. Or find a house or an apartment.

1108
01:23:53,441 --> 01:23:58,612
If it was just me, I'd sleep in the subway. But
I've got Carol and the kids. I've gotta go back.

1109
01:23:58,695 --> 01:24:00,780
No two ways about it. I'm licked.

1110
01:24:01,614 --> 01:24:05,158
Yeah, but... that means the job,
your whole future.

1111
01:24:05,241 --> 01:24:07,327
I'll live. I did before.

1112
01:24:07,410 --> 01:24:09,454
Why, Dave, that's terrible.

1113
01:24:09,537 --> 01:24:14,540
I called Carol last night. I told her I'd give it
one more day but I know there isn't a chance.

1114
01:24:14,623 --> 01:24:17,626
She's lonely too. I've gotta go back.

1115
01:24:18,292 --> 01:24:20,378
Big job or not.

1116
01:24:21,837 --> 01:24:23,923
What is it, Phil?

1117
01:24:25,215 --> 01:24:28,884
- Oh, nothing.
- Phil, let's get out of the house for a while.

1118
01:24:28,967 --> 01:24:33,096
Kathy won't mind, and you know Ma's
out of danger now. You need some air.

1119
01:24:33,179 --> 01:24:35,848
- I am going out. I'm going up to Flume Inn.
- What?

1120
01:24:35,932 --> 01:24:38,767
I'll use the plane tickets
we had for this afternoon.

1121
01:24:38,850 --> 01:24:40,519
- What for?
- It's a waste of time.

1122
01:24:40,602 --> 01:24:42,979
There must be a time once
when you fight back.

1123
01:24:43,061 --> 01:24:45,772
I wanna make 'em look me
in the eye and do it.

1124
01:24:45,855 --> 01:24:49,817
I want the satisfaction. I can't explain it,
but I wanna do it for myself.

1125
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:54,321
- Phil, they're nothing more than...
- Let him do it. You have to face 'em once.

1126
01:24:54,405 --> 01:24:58,949
- I did it once, at Monterey.
- They are more than nasty little snobs.

1127
01:24:59,032 --> 01:25:01,450
You call 'em that and you can dismiss 'em.

1128
01:25:01,534 --> 01:25:07,247
They're persistent little traitors to everything
this country stands for. You have to fight 'em.

1129
01:25:07,330 --> 01:25:12,792
Not just for the "poor, poor Jews", as Dave
says, but for all this country stands for.

1130
01:25:14,836 --> 01:25:16,920
Anyway, I'm going.

1131
01:25:20,132 --> 01:25:22,216
See you later.

1132
01:25:52,448 --> 01:25:55,157
- You'll find this room more comfortable.
- Thank you.

1133
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:58,744
I have a reservation, double room
and bath, today through Thursday.

1134
01:25:58,827 --> 01:26:00,912
- In what name?
- Green. Philip Green.

1135
01:26:00,996 --> 01:26:02,998
Yes, Mr Green.

1136
01:26:03,081 --> 01:26:05,707
- My wife will be here tomorrow.
- Oh, yes.

1137
01:26:08,542 --> 01:26:10,628
- Oh, one more thing.
- Yes?

1138
01:26:10,711 --> 01:26:13,005
Is your hotel restricted?

1139
01:26:15,089 --> 01:26:18,341
Well... I'd hardly say it was restricted.

1140
01:26:18,758 --> 01:26:21,053
Then it's {y: I}not restricted?

1141
01:26:22,637 --> 01:26:25,055
Would you excuse me a moment, please?

1142
01:26:42,485 --> 01:26:44,655
- How do you do, Mr Green?
- How do you do?

1143
01:26:44,738 --> 01:26:48,447
In answer to your question,
may I inquire, are {y: I}you,,,

1144
01:26:48,530 --> 01:26:54,161
Uh, that is, do you follow the Hebrew religion
yourself? Or do you just want to make sure?

1145
01:26:55,328 --> 01:26:58,580
I've asked a simple question.
I'd like a simple answer.

1146
01:26:58,664 --> 01:27:04,085
Well, you see, we do have a very high-class
clientele and... well, naturally.

1147
01:27:04,168 --> 01:27:06,836
Then you do restrict your guests to Gentiles?

1148
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:09,255
Well, I wouldn't say that, Mr Green.

1149
01:27:10,632 --> 01:27:15,927
In any event, there's been some mistake.
We don't have a free room in the entire hotel.

1150
01:27:16,010 --> 01:27:19,429
But perhaps I can fix you up
at the Brewster Hotel near the station.

1151
01:27:19,513 --> 01:27:21,806
I'm not staying at the Brewster.

1152
01:27:21,889 --> 01:27:25,309
Look, I'm Jewish and you don't take Jews.
That's it, isn't it?

1153
01:27:25,393 --> 01:27:28,270
- I never said that.
- If you don't accept Jews, say so.

1154
01:27:28,352 --> 01:27:31,813
Don't raise your voice to me,
Mr Green. Speak quietly, please.

1155
01:27:31,896 --> 01:27:33,899
Do you or don't you?

1156
01:27:33,983 --> 01:27:38,027
Mr Green, I'm a very busy man. If you
want me to phone the Brewster, I'll do so.

1157
01:27:38,111 --> 01:27:40,195
Otherwise...

1158
01:27:41,778 --> 01:27:43,864
Otherwise what?

1159
01:27:44,991 --> 01:27:47,075
<i>(strikes bell)</i>

1160
01:28:29,523 --> 01:28:32,026
- {y: I}(front door slams)
- Tommy?

1161
01:28:32,901 --> 01:28:35,613
Oh, Phil. Hello.

1162
01:28:39,699 --> 01:28:41,991
It was bad. I can tell by your face.

1163
01:28:43,492 --> 01:28:45,911
Dave was right. It was a waste of time.

1164
01:28:47,704 --> 01:28:51,915
- How's Ma?
- She's fine. She's asleep. Tom's out playing.

1165
01:28:51,998 --> 01:28:54,043
- Where's Dave?
- He's out with Anne.

1166
01:28:54,126 --> 01:28:59,172
He packed all afternoon. They're having a last
night on the town. They'll wind up here later.

1167
01:28:59,255 --> 01:29:02,173
- How about some coffee?
- No, thanks.

1168
01:29:07,093 --> 01:29:09,179
Tired, darling?

1169
01:29:10,596 --> 01:29:12,598
No. I'm...

1170
01:29:12,681 --> 01:29:14,767
I'm just thinking about Dave.

1171
01:29:17,310 --> 01:29:20,938
- You're thinking about the cottage.
- Yes, I did think about that.

1172
01:29:21,021 --> 01:29:24,607
So have I. You must know that.
And it wouldn't work, Phil.

1173
01:29:24,690 --> 01:29:29,027
It would be too uncomfortable for Dave
moving into one of those neighbourhoods.

1174
01:29:29,110 --> 01:29:33,447
Darling, don't you see that?
It's detestable, but that's the way it is.

1175
01:29:33,530 --> 01:29:38,076
It's even worse in New Canaan.
There nobody can sell or rent to a Jew.

1176
01:29:38,159 --> 01:29:43,247
Even in Darien, where Jane's house is and my
house is, there's a gentleman's agreement...

1177
01:29:43,330 --> 01:29:45,207
Gentleman's?

1178
01:29:45,290 --> 01:29:47,374
Kathy, you can't...

1179
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:54,546
You're not gonna fight it, Kathy.

1180
01:29:54,630 --> 01:29:59,550
You're just gonna give in, play along,
just let their idiotic rules stand.

1181
01:29:59,634 --> 01:30:02,468
I don't play along.
But what can one person do?

1182
01:30:02,551 --> 01:30:05,221
Tell 'em to go jump in the lake!
What can {y: I}they do?

1183
01:30:05,304 --> 01:30:07,890
Plenty! Ostracise him.

1184
01:30:07,974 --> 01:30:11,810
Some of the markets not deliver food.
Not even wait on him.

1185
01:30:11,893 --> 01:30:15,853
Phil, the series will be over
by the time we get there.

1186
01:30:15,937 --> 01:30:19,898
- Phil, face facts.
- You expect us to live in that cottage now?

1187
01:30:19,982 --> 01:30:22,442
You can't change the world.
I'm on Dave's side.

1188
01:30:22,526 --> 01:30:26,780
Well, I'm not on Dave's side or any side,
except against {y: I}their side.

1189
01:30:26,863 --> 01:30:31,241
Do you or don't you believe in this?
Because if you do, how can you talk about...

1190
01:30:32,616 --> 01:30:36,787
- Tom, please. Kathy and I are talking.
- But, Pop, I...

1191
01:30:41,249 --> 01:30:43,499
Tom, what is it? What's the matter?

1192
01:30:45,210 --> 01:30:48,587
Did you have a fight?
Argument with one of the guys?

1193
01:30:50,089 --> 01:30:52,172
They called me a dirty Jew!

1194
01:30:53,048 --> 01:30:55,051
And a stinking kike!

1195
01:30:55,135 --> 01:30:59,804
- And they all ran off and...
- Oh, darling, it's not true! It's not true.

1196
01:30:59,888 --> 01:31:02,930
You're no more Jewish than I am.
It's a horrible mistake.

1197
01:31:03,014 --> 01:31:05,100
Kathy!

1198
01:31:05,850 --> 01:31:09,020
Come with me, Tom.
We'll talk about it in here.

1199
01:31:16,649 --> 01:31:18,736
<i>(Tom sobs)</i>

1200
01:31:19,193 --> 01:31:21,278
Take it easy. Take it easy, son.

1201
01:31:37,125 --> 01:31:39,208
- Want some water?
- Yes.

1202
01:31:42,711 --> 01:31:44,879
Where'd it happen?

1203
01:31:44,962 --> 01:31:48,841
- Jimmy in it? Somebody sock somebody?
- No. They just yelled it.

1204
01:31:48,924 --> 01:31:53,093
It was at our corner.
One was a kid from school.

1205
01:31:53,177 --> 01:31:56,055
They were playing hop
and I asked could I play too.

1206
01:31:56,138 --> 01:32:00,391
Then the school one said
no dirty little Jew could play with them.

1207
01:32:00,475 --> 01:32:03,393
Then they all yelled those other things.

1208
01:32:03,477 --> 01:32:07,938
I started to speak, then they all yelled
"Your father has a long, curly beard"...

1209
01:32:08,021 --> 01:32:10,106
...and turned and ran.

1210
01:32:10,190 --> 01:32:13,276
Why did they, Pop? Why?

1211
01:32:18,072 --> 01:32:20,156
Come on. Drink some of this.

1212
01:32:24,242 --> 01:32:27,204
Did you wanna tell 'em
that you weren't really Jewish?

1213
01:32:27,287 --> 01:32:29,371
- No.
- That's good.

1214
01:32:29,454 --> 01:32:32,582
See, there's a lot of kids
just like you who are Jewish...

1215
01:32:32,666 --> 01:32:37,335
...and if you said it, it would be admitting
there {y: I}was something bad in being Jewish...

1216
01:32:37,418 --> 01:32:39,504
...and something swell in not.

1217
01:32:39,587 --> 01:32:41,798
They wouldn't fight. They just ran.

1218
01:32:42,673 --> 01:32:44,925
Yeah, I know.

1219
01:32:45,008 --> 01:32:47,926
There's a lot of grown-ups
just like that too, Tom.

1220
01:32:48,009 --> 01:32:52,180
Only, they do it with wisecracks
instead of yelling.

1221
01:33:00,563 --> 01:33:02,645
- OK?
- Sure.

1222
01:33:02,728 --> 01:33:04,815
Attaboy.

1223
01:33:04,898 --> 01:33:09,360
- Wanna go and read while I talk to Kathy?
- OK.

1224
01:33:10,111 --> 01:33:14,322
Oh, uh... Let's keep this
to ourselves till Grandma's well, huh?

1225
01:33:14,406 --> 01:33:16,281
OK.

1226
01:33:43,260 --> 01:33:45,428
Phil, I've got something to tell you.

1227
01:33:45,511 --> 01:33:51,475
I'm pretty tired of feeling wrong. Everything
I do or say is wrong about anything Jewish.

1228
01:33:51,559 --> 01:33:54,727
All I did just now was
to face facts about Dave and Darien.

1229
01:33:55,019 --> 01:33:57,937
- And to tell Tom just what you did...
- Notjust what.

1230
01:33:58,021 --> 01:34:01,858
You assured him he's a wonderful creature:
A white Christian American.

1231
01:34:01,941 --> 01:34:04,358
You gave him a taste of superiority...

1232
01:34:04,442 --> 01:34:07,570
...the poison that millions of parents
give their children.

1233
01:34:07,653 --> 01:34:09,780
- You do think I'm an anti-Semite.
- No.

1234
01:34:09,864 --> 01:34:13,199
You do. You've thought it
secretly for a long time.

1235
01:34:13,282 --> 01:34:16,035
No. But I see that lots of
nice people who aren't...

1236
01:34:16,118 --> 01:34:20,456
...people who despise it and deplore it
and protest their own innocence...

1237
01:34:20,539 --> 01:34:22,664
...help it along, then wonder why it grows.

1238
01:34:22,748 --> 01:34:25,083
People who'd never beat up a Jew.

1239
01:34:25,167 --> 01:34:31,296
People who think anti-Semitism is away off in
some crackpot place with low-class morons.

1240
01:34:31,922 --> 01:34:35,091
That's the biggest discovery I've made, Kathy.

1241
01:34:35,175 --> 01:34:38,260
The good people, the nice people.

1242
01:34:39,094 --> 01:34:42,305
You mean you're not going
to Darien this summer?

1243
01:34:42,388 --> 01:34:47,601
- Let's save that for another time.
- I hate everything about this horrible thing!

1244
01:34:47,683 --> 01:34:51,311
They make trouble for everybody.
They force people to take sides.

1245
01:34:51,395 --> 01:34:53,062
Quit it! Quit that.

1246
01:34:53,145 --> 01:34:57,525
They didn't suggest the series. They haven't
got a single thing to do with you and me!

1247
01:34:57,608 --> 01:35:01,152
Don't shout at me. I know
what you're thinking about marrying me.

1248
01:35:01,236 --> 01:35:03,863
I saw it on your face when I said that to Tom.

1249
01:35:03,947 --> 01:35:07,532
And don't treat me to any more lessons
of tolerance. I'm sick of it!

1250
01:35:07,615 --> 01:35:10,868
I'm not going to marry into
hothead shoutings and nerves...

1251
01:35:10,952 --> 01:35:13,203
...and you might as well know it now.

1252
01:35:18,958 --> 01:35:21,041
Kathy.

1253
01:35:22,876 --> 01:35:27,713
- I'm sorry I shouted. I hate it when I do it.
- It's notjust the shouting. It's everything.

1254
01:35:27,797 --> 01:35:32,134
You've changed since that first night
I met you at Uncle John's.

1255
01:35:32,218 --> 01:35:34,302
It's no use, Phil.

1256
01:35:35,177 --> 01:35:37,930
Now I know why I drew back
when you told me the angle.

1257
01:35:38,013 --> 01:35:40,265
You're doing an impossible thing.

1258
01:35:41,432 --> 01:35:44,935
You are what you are
for the one life you have.

1259
01:35:45,018 --> 01:35:50,480
You can't help it if you were born Christian
and not Jewish. It doesn't mean you're glad.

1260
01:35:50,564 --> 01:35:54,317
But I am glad. There, I've said it.

1261
01:35:54,401 --> 01:35:57,529
It'd be terrible. I'm glad I'm not.

1262
01:35:57,612 --> 01:36:01,990
I could never make {y: I}you understand that.
You could never understand that it's a fact.

1263
01:36:02,073 --> 01:36:06,952
Like being glad you're good-looking
instead of ugly, rich instead of poor...

1264
01:36:07,035 --> 01:36:10,371
...young instead of old,
healthy instead of sick.

1265
01:36:10,455 --> 01:36:13,331
You could never understand that.

1266
01:36:13,415 --> 01:36:17,209
It's just a practical fact,
not ajudgment that I'm superior.

1267
01:36:17,293 --> 01:36:21,130
But you could never see that.
You'd twist it into something horrible.

1268
01:36:21,212 --> 01:36:25,466
A conniving, an aiding and abetting,
a thing I loathe as much as you do.

1269
01:36:25,550 --> 01:36:29,136
It's better to finish it now.
Get it over with right now.

1270
01:36:30,178 --> 01:36:32,262
I...

1271
01:36:33,471 --> 01:36:35,557
I hate you for doing this.

1272
01:36:36,932 --> 01:36:41,769
We could have been so happy. We had
so much to enjoy and so much to share.

1273
01:36:41,853 --> 01:36:45,439
And I hate you for
taking it away from both of us.

1274
01:36:45,522 --> 01:36:47,607
I hate you for that.

1275
01:36:56,072 --> 01:36:57,865
<i>(knock on door)</i>

1276
01:36:59,949 --> 01:37:05,704

- On your last night? Let's wake him up.

1277
01:37:05,787 --> 01:37:09,082
- Let the poor guy alone.
- It's against my deepest principles.

1278
01:37:09,166 --> 01:37:11,500
Hey, Phil. Come on, wake up. It's us.

1279
01:37:12,125 --> 01:37:15,754
- Let the poor lug alone.
- I told you. I never let any man alone.

1280
01:37:18,589 --> 01:37:22,301
Hey! I thought we were expected,
sleepyhead. Where's Kathy?

1281
01:37:22,384 --> 01:37:25,761
- She left early.
- My, you look nice in pyjamas.

1282
01:37:25,844 --> 01:37:28,638
Get on a dressing gown. I'll close my eyes.

1283
01:37:28,721 --> 01:37:33,892
Go get the ice cubes so he can get dressed.
He wouldn't let a dame see his ratty bathrobe.

1284
01:37:33,975 --> 01:37:35,852
Go on. Don't trifle with your luck.

1285
01:37:35,936 --> 01:37:38,312
I don't think men should wear coats and ties.

1286
01:37:38,395 --> 01:37:42,357
They lookjust wonderful
in shirts and pants - and in pyjamas!

1287
01:37:47,778 --> 01:37:50,446
What's wrong, Phil?

1288
01:37:50,530 --> 01:37:52,950
Skip it.

1289
01:37:53,032 --> 01:37:54,907
Flume Inn?

1290
01:37:57,786 --> 01:38:03,123
Tommy got called "dirty Jew" and "kike"
by some kids down the street.

1291
01:38:03,748 --> 01:38:06,667
Came home pretty badly shaken up.

1292
01:38:08,126 --> 01:38:13,130
Now you know it all. That's the place
they really get at you: Your kids.

1293
01:38:14,381 --> 01:38:16,466
Now you even know that.

1294
01:38:17,884 --> 01:38:21,262
Well, you can quit being Jewish now.

1295
01:38:21,345 --> 01:38:23,428
There's nothing else.

1296
01:38:25,347 --> 01:38:29,058
My own kids got it without the names, Phil.

1297
01:38:29,142 --> 01:38:34,605
Just setting their hearts on a summer camp
their bunch were going to...

1298
01:38:34,689 --> 01:38:37,022
...and being kept out.

1299
01:38:39,316 --> 01:38:41,402
It wrecked them for a while.

1300
01:38:42,819 --> 01:38:46,322
The only other thing
that makes you wanna murder is...

1301
01:38:47,281 --> 01:38:49,866
There was a boy in our outfit.

1302
01:38:49,949 --> 01:38:52,159
Abe Schlussman.

1303
01:38:52,242 --> 01:38:54,995
Good soldier. Good engineer.

1304
01:38:57,121 --> 01:39:01,833
One night we...
we got bombed, and he caught it.

1305
01:39:01,916 --> 01:39:04,461
I was ten yards off.

1306
01:39:04,544 --> 01:39:08,714
Somebody said
"Gimme a hand with this sheeny."

1307
01:39:11,007 --> 01:39:14,302
Those were the last words he ever heard.

1308
01:39:39,445 --> 01:39:40,905
Good morning.

1309
01:39:41,156 --> 01:39:42,865
Good morning.

1310
01:39:42,948 --> 01:39:46,742
Miss Wales... here it is.
The first three instalments, ready to go.

1311
01:39:46,825 --> 01:39:50,536
Send every ten pages downstairs.
Have it set up in galley immediately.

1312
01:39:50,620 --> 01:39:52,830
Tell 'em I'm in a hurry. A big hurry.

1313
01:39:52,914 --> 01:39:57,459
- How long will that much take you?
- Under 10,000 words. I can finish by tonight.

1314
01:39:58,416 --> 01:40:00,503
I am pretty fast.

1315
01:40:02,420 --> 01:40:04,963
"I Was Jewish for Eight Weeks."

1316
01:40:07,091 --> 01:40:10,427
Why, Mr Green, you're a Christian!

1317
01:40:11,261 --> 01:40:13,887
- But I never...
- Well?

1318
01:40:13,970 --> 01:40:16,889
I've been around you more
than anybody and I never once...

1319
01:40:16,972 --> 01:40:19,851
What's so upsetting about that, Miss Wales?

1320
01:40:20,392 --> 01:40:24,020
You mean there is some difference
between Jews and Christians?

1321
01:40:24,104 --> 01:40:28,606
Look at me. Look at me hard. I'm the same
man I was yesterday. That's true, isn't it?

1322
01:40:28,689 --> 01:40:30,858
Why should you be so astonished?

1323
01:40:31,318 --> 01:40:36,030
You can't believe anybody would give up
the glory of being a Christian for eight weeks.

1324
01:40:36,114 --> 01:40:38,073
That's what's eating you, isn't it?

1325
01:40:38,156 --> 01:40:43,660
If I say that's anti-Semitism, your feeling that
being Christian is better than being Jewish...

1326
01:40:43,743 --> 01:40:47,788
...you'll tell me I'm heckling you
or I'm twisting your words around or...

1327
01:40:47,871 --> 01:40:51,833
...it's just facing facts,
as someone else said to me yesterday.

1328
01:40:51,916 --> 01:40:53,626
Face me, Miss Wales. Look at me.

1329
01:40:53,709 --> 01:40:57,169
Same face, same eyes, same nose,
same suit, same everything.

1330
01:40:57,253 --> 01:41:00,798
Here. Take my hand. Feel it!
Same flesh as yours, isn't it?

1331
01:41:00,881 --> 01:41:03,466
No different today than it was yesterday.

1332
01:41:03,550 --> 01:41:07,302
The only thing that's different
is the word "Christian".

1333
01:41:15,559 --> 01:41:18,187
Of course I'll see him. Send him right in.

1334
01:41:19,938 --> 01:41:22,314
- Good morning.
- Thanks for seeing me, John.

1335
01:41:22,398 --> 01:41:26,233
Sorry to break in on you. I gave
the first half to Miss Wales for typing.

1336
01:41:26,316 --> 01:41:28,527
- I'll finish by the end of the week.
- Good.

1337
01:41:28,610 --> 01:41:30,611
I want to clear out.

1338
01:41:30,695 --> 01:41:32,865
- Completely?
- Yeah, completely.

1339
01:41:32,948 --> 01:41:35,198
- Back to California?
- As soon as we pack.

1340
01:41:35,282 --> 01:41:39,368
- Will the office get me train tickets?
- Yes. What about future assignments?

1341
01:41:39,452 --> 01:41:41,788
- I'll... let you know.
- {y: I}(intercom)

1342
01:41:43,456 --> 01:41:46,167
I don't want to be disturbed for anything.

1343
01:41:47,876 --> 01:41:52,628
Sorry about you two. Kathy told my wife
this morning. She seemed pretty upset.

1344
01:41:52,712 --> 01:41:56,007
I'd have liked it to go on.
It seemed so right, you two.

1345
01:41:56,090 --> 01:41:58,966
Anything I can do? Can I be of any help?

1346
01:41:59,049 --> 01:42:02,428
Talk is useless, I know, but...
maybe someone who knew you both...

1347
01:42:02,511 --> 01:42:04,596
Thanks, John. Thanks a lot.

1348
01:42:06,848 --> 01:42:10,143
I'd better get back.
I'm clearing out of the office tonight.

1349
01:42:10,225 --> 01:42:15,855
I'll finish the last three instalments at home,
bring 'em in and we'll have one more session.

1350
01:42:26,029 --> 01:42:27,697
Hey, I'm lookin' for you.

1351
01:42:27,781 --> 01:42:31,574
It's the goldarnedest idea for a series
this magazine has ever run.

1352
01:42:31,657 --> 01:42:34,786
I couldn't put these ten pages down.
The place is buzzing.

1353
01:42:34,869 --> 01:42:38,330
About artwork.
Photographic treatment's my hunch.

1354
01:42:38,413 --> 01:42:42,166
OK. But no pictures of my kid
or me or my mother. Understand?

1355
01:42:42,249 --> 01:42:47,669
Stop pushin' me around. That's the trouble
with you Christians. Aggressive, loud, pushy.

1356
01:42:47,753 --> 01:42:50,798
Everybody's got a copy but me.
When's my turn to see it?

1357
01:42:50,881 --> 01:42:53,425
The place is in a frenzy
over the wonderful plot.

1358
01:42:53,509 --> 01:42:57,720
Though what plot there can be
to a series on anti-Semitism escapes me.

1359
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:08,019
This is something.

1360
01:43:08,103 --> 01:43:10,063
It's hot all right.

1361
01:43:10,146 --> 01:43:12,481
You fooled me, Phil, completely.

1362
01:43:12,564 --> 01:43:17,859
Though I did want to say, how have you lived
this long spending this much juice on it?

1363
01:43:18,944 --> 01:43:21,529
I get it now. Everything.

1364
01:43:23,197 --> 01:43:25,573
- This is dynamite.
- Read the rest of it.

1365
01:43:25,657 --> 01:43:29,326
If everybody'd act it outjust one day
of the year, it'd end overnight.

1366
01:43:29,410 --> 01:43:33,414
I gotta go. Minify ordered
everything stops for this. See you later.

1367
01:43:33,497 --> 01:43:36,749
It's a wonderful notion, Phil. Congratulations.

1368
01:43:37,583 --> 01:43:41,460
Hey, you look kind of beat. I worry about you.

1369
01:43:42,086 --> 01:43:44,421
- I'm fine.
- Uh-huh?

1370
01:43:44,504 --> 01:43:47,007
It's over with you and Kathy, isn't it?

1371
01:43:48,216 --> 01:43:51,594
Phil, I guessed it last night but I wasn't sure.

1372
01:43:52,386 --> 01:43:54,928
It is over, isn't it?

1373
01:43:55,011 --> 01:43:57,931
Everything's so rotten, Phil. For me too.

1374
01:43:58,848 --> 01:44:04,519
Look, if you're free tonight, come to my place
and listen to my troubles. How about it?

1375
01:44:04,602 --> 01:44:06,856
OK. Thanks.

1376
01:44:06,939 --> 01:44:09,022
We'll have dinner.

1377
01:44:27,037 --> 01:44:29,330
- Feeling better?
- Yeah.

1378
01:44:29,414 --> 01:44:31,290
Good.

1379
01:44:31,790 --> 01:44:33,876
You almost smiled a minute ago.

1380
01:44:35,169 --> 01:44:38,421
You take your coffee black,
don't you? And one lump.

1381
01:44:38,504 --> 01:44:40,588
I remember from the party.

1382
01:44:41,422 --> 01:44:43,508
You do?

1383
01:44:45,176 --> 01:44:48,637
You're quite a girl, Anne.
I don't think I told you that before.

1384
01:44:48,721 --> 01:44:50,803
Me? Sure. Everybody loves Anne.

1385
01:44:52,890 --> 01:44:56,266
You said you weren't very happy.
Do you want to talk about it?

1386
01:44:56,350 --> 01:44:58,644
Nothing bores a man like an unhappy female.

1387
01:44:58,728 --> 01:45:00,811
Now look, Anne.

1388
01:45:00,895 --> 01:45:06,483
We're good friends. Even in this short a time,
we've been through quite a bit together.

1389
01:45:06,566 --> 01:45:10,944
It's good for me to be able to be with you
tonight. I wish you would talk to me.

1390
01:45:13,614 --> 01:45:15,698
All right, I'll talk.

1391
01:45:17,242 --> 01:45:21,912
We've been skirting it all evening.
Let's bring it out and clear the air.

1392
01:45:23,245 --> 01:45:26,415
Do you mind if I say something
about you and Kathy?

1393
01:45:30,627 --> 01:45:35,546
- Let's don't.
- All right, Phil. Mind your manners.

1394
01:45:35,630 --> 01:45:38,633
Be a gentleman. Don't let
the flag touch the ground.

1395
01:45:38,716 --> 01:45:41,843
This sort of honourableness
gets me sick, Phil.

1396
01:45:43,595 --> 01:45:47,554
- I think you're pretty straight and she's...
- Anne, drop it!

1397
01:45:52,768 --> 01:45:56,354
OK. I'm a cat.

1398
01:45:56,437 --> 01:45:59,023
And this is dirty pool.

1399
01:45:59,106 --> 01:46:01,858
But I'm intolerant of hypocrites.

1400
01:46:01,942 --> 01:46:04,442
That's what I said, Phil: Hypocrites.

1401
01:46:04,526 --> 01:46:08,154
She'd rather let Dave lose thatjob
than risk a fuss up there.

1402
01:46:08,238 --> 01:46:11,408
That's it, isn't it? She's afraid.

1403
01:46:11,491 --> 01:46:15,410
The Kathys everywhere are afraid of
getting the gate from "nice people".

1404
01:46:15,494 --> 01:46:17,828
They make little clucks of disapproval.

1405
01:46:17,911 --> 01:46:22,290
But they want you and Uncle John to
stand up and yell and take sides and fight.

1406
01:46:22,374 --> 01:46:24,876
But do {y: I}they fight? Oh, no.

1407
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:27,336
Kathy and Harry and Jane and all of 'em.

1408
01:46:27,420 --> 01:46:33,423
They scold Bilbo twice a year and think
they've fought for democracy in this country.

1409
01:46:33,507 --> 01:46:37,509
They haven't got the guts to take
the step from talking to action.

1410
01:46:37,592 --> 01:46:40,263
One little action on one little front.

1411
01:46:40,346 --> 01:46:43,724
It's not the whole answer,
but it's gotta start somewhere.

1412
01:46:43,807 --> 01:46:48,394
And it's gotta be with action,
not pamphlets, not even with your series.

1413
01:46:48,477 --> 01:46:54,398
It's gotta be with people. Nice people, rich
people, poor people, big and little people.

1414
01:46:54,481 --> 01:46:57,190
And it's gotta be quick.

1415
01:46:57,274 --> 01:47:00,777
But not Kathy. She can't. She never will.

1416
01:47:01,819 --> 01:47:03,905
She doesn't rate you, Phil.

1417
01:47:17,291 --> 01:47:20,584
Phil... Do you hate me for saying this?

1418
01:47:21,669 --> 01:47:25,296
- No.
- I'd like to say one thing more.

1419
01:47:25,379 --> 01:47:27,340
There's time.

1420
01:47:27,423 --> 01:47:32,010
If two people are right for each other,
they usually discover it in time.

1421
01:47:33,802 --> 01:47:35,971
If I had a kid I loved...

1422
01:47:36,055 --> 01:47:41,892
...l'd want him to be brought up with people
who felt the way I did about the basic things.

1423
01:47:41,975 --> 01:47:44,477
Are you proposing, Anne?

1424
01:47:46,354 --> 01:47:48,438
Maybe.

1425
01:47:48,521 --> 01:47:50,399
Maybe I am.

1426
01:48:03,867 --> 01:48:05,910
Hello.

1427
01:48:05,992 --> 01:48:08,078
Oh, Dave. Hello.

1428
01:48:09,913 --> 01:48:13,165
Thank you for coming. It was good of you.

1429
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,669
- You know about Phil and me?
- Yes.

1430
01:48:19,795 --> 01:48:21,880
I want to ask you something.

1431
01:48:22,631 --> 01:48:25,758
- And I want you to answer me honestly.
- Go ahead.

1432
01:48:26,801 --> 01:48:28,886
Do you think I'm anti-Semitic?

1433
01:48:31,554 --> 01:48:33,722
- No, Kathy, I don't.
- Phil does.

1434
01:48:33,806 --> 01:48:36,099
- Does he?
- You know I'm not anti-Semitic.

1435
01:48:36,182 --> 01:48:41,228
You're a Jew and you know it. Why can I
make it clear to everybody but Phil?

1436
01:48:41,311 --> 01:48:44,314
I was the one who suggested the series.
Did you know that?

1437
01:48:44,397 --> 01:48:47,023
- No, I didn't.
- I hate this thing as much as he does.

1438
01:48:47,107 --> 01:48:49,609
Why can't he see it? Why?

1439
01:48:49,693 --> 01:48:54,155
Tonight at dinner a man told a vicious story
and I was sick with rage and shame.

1440
01:48:54,239 --> 01:48:57,031
- But Phil actually...
- What kind of story, Kathy?

1441
01:48:57,115 --> 01:49:00,993
- Just a story. It had nothing to...
- Suppose you tell me anyway.

1442
01:49:01,076 --> 01:49:05,413
Well, it was just a vulgar little joke.
It has nothing to do with this.

1443
01:49:05,496 --> 01:49:07,581
Take it easy, Kathy. Maybe it has.

1444
01:49:07,665 --> 01:49:10,792
What kind of ajoke?
I can take naughty words, you know.

1445
01:49:10,875 --> 01:49:12,836
But why?

1446
01:49:12,919 --> 01:49:16,169
Oh, all right. It was a man named Lockhardt...

1447
01:49:16,253 --> 01:49:20,424
...and he tried to get laughs with words
like "kike" and "coon", and...

1448
01:49:20,507 --> 01:49:25,469
...I despised him and everybody else there.
- What did you do? When he told the joke?

1449
01:49:25,553 --> 01:49:27,389
What do you mean?

1450
01:49:27,472 --> 01:49:30,389
I mean... what did you say when he finished?

1451
01:49:30,932 --> 01:49:33,267
I wanted to yell at him and get up and leave.

1452
01:49:33,350 --> 01:49:37,271
I wanted to say to everyone at that table:
Why do we sit here and take it...

1453
01:49:37,354 --> 01:49:41,399
...when he's attacking everything
we believe in? Why don't we call him on it?

1454
01:49:41,482 --> 01:49:45,944
- And what did you do?
- I just sat there. I felt ashamed.

1455
01:49:46,028 --> 01:49:48,111
We all just sat there.

1456
01:49:49,613 --> 01:49:51,197
Yeah.

1457
01:49:51,281 --> 01:49:54,867
And then you left and got me on the phone.

1458
01:49:55,035 --> 01:49:59,871
Later, after dinner was over, I said
I was ill and I am. I'm sick through.

1459
01:49:59,954 --> 01:50:05,417
I wonder if you'd feel so sick now,
Kathy, if you {y: I}had nailed him.

1460
01:50:05,500 --> 01:50:08,836
There's a funny kind of elation
about socking back.

1461
01:50:10,086 --> 01:50:12,171
I learned that a long time ago.

1462
01:50:13,255 --> 01:50:17,008
- Phil's learned it.
- And I haven't?

1463
01:50:17,091 --> 01:50:19,511
Lots of things are pretty rough, Kathy.

1464
01:50:19,594 --> 01:50:22,597
This is just a different kind of a war.

1465
01:50:24,639 --> 01:50:29,602
- And anybody who crawls away is a quitter...
- I didn't say that.

1466
01:50:30,018 --> 01:50:32,103
You did.

1467
01:50:32,520 --> 01:50:36,857
Somebody told a story. Sure,
a man at a dinner table told the story...

1468
01:50:36,941 --> 01:50:40,818
...and the nice people didn't laugh.
They even despised him for it.

1469
01:50:40,902 --> 01:50:42,736
But they let it pass.

1470
01:50:43,028 --> 01:50:47,239
And behind thatjoke is Flume Inn
and Darien and Tommy and those kids...

1471
01:50:47,323 --> 01:50:50,826
And if you don't stop
with thatjoke, where do you stop?

1472
01:50:53,577 --> 01:50:56,704
- Is that what you mean?
- That's right.

1473
01:50:56,788 --> 01:50:58,873
Where do you call a halt?

1474
01:51:00,166 --> 01:51:03,210
I got mad at Phil because
he expected me to fight this...

1475
01:51:03,293 --> 01:51:07,380
...instead of getting mad at the people
who help it along, like Lockhardt.

1476
01:51:07,463 --> 01:51:10,840
Not just old Lockhardt.
At least he's out in the open.

1477
01:51:10,924 --> 01:51:15,052
But what about the other dinner guests?
They're supposed to be on your side.

1478
01:51:15,135 --> 01:51:19,098
- And they didn't act or...
- No, they didn't. And I didn't.

1479
01:51:19,181 --> 01:51:21,682
That's the trouble: We never do.

1480
01:51:26,103 --> 01:51:28,187
It all links up, Dave.

1481
01:51:29,689 --> 01:51:33,649
Phil will fight. He can fight.
He always will fight.

1482
01:51:34,983 --> 01:51:43,115
And if I just sit by and... feel sick,
then I'm not a fit wife for him.

1483
01:51:45,952 --> 01:51:50,203
It was always on those deeper issues
that we had our quarrels.

1484
01:51:50,287 --> 01:51:52,414
Always.

1485
01:51:52,497 --> 01:51:55,625
- And I never knew it until now.
- Sure.

1486
01:51:58,543 --> 01:52:05,841
A man wants his wife to be more
than just a companion, Kathy.

1487
01:52:05,924 --> 01:52:08,633
More than his beloved girl.

1488
01:52:08,717 --> 01:52:11,470
More than even the mother of his children.

1489
01:52:11,553 --> 01:52:17,056
He wants a sidekick, a buddy,
to go through the rough spots with...

1490
01:52:17,140 --> 01:52:22,811
...and she has to feel that
the same things are the rough spots...

1491
01:52:22,894 --> 01:52:26,606
...or they're always out of line with each other.

1492
01:52:26,689 --> 01:52:29,525
You're not cast in bronze, sweetie.

1493
01:52:29,609 --> 01:52:33,236
You're nice and soft and pliable...

1494
01:52:33,320 --> 01:52:37,949
...and you can do anything you have to do,
or want to do, with yourself.

1495
01:52:42,535 --> 01:52:44,411
Can I?

1496
01:52:47,079 --> 01:52:48,956
Can I?

1497
01:52:53,335 --> 01:52:55,962
But it's got to be more than talk.

1498
01:53:02,425 --> 01:53:04,509
<i>(front door)</i>

1499
01:53:15,059 --> 01:53:16,644
Now don't scold, Phil.

1500
01:53:16,727 --> 01:53:22,440
I couldn't sleep so I sneaked into your room
and stole the first two instalments.

1501
01:53:22,523 --> 01:53:24,609
Come here.

1502
01:53:46,541 --> 01:53:52,213
Thanks, Ma. I think maybe I'd rather
have that than almost anything.

1503
01:53:52,296 --> 01:53:56,508
I wish your father could have
read this, Phil. He'd have liked it.

1504
01:53:58,175 --> 01:54:00,260
He'd have liked this.

1505
01:54:02,512 --> 01:54:05,557
"Leaving the inn,
I knew all about every man or woman...

1506
01:54:05,640 --> 01:54:09,308
...who'd been told the job
was filled when it wasn't."

1507
01:54:09,392 --> 01:54:14,062
"Every youngster who'd ever been turned
down by a college or a summer camp."

1508
01:54:14,145 --> 01:54:19,024
"I knew the rage that goes through you when
you see your own child shaken and dazed."

1509
01:54:19,108 --> 01:54:22,442
"From that moment I saw
an unending attack by adults...

1510
01:54:22,526 --> 01:54:25,821
...on kids of seven and eight
and ten and twelve...

1511
01:54:25,904 --> 01:54:31,950
...on adolescent boys and girls trying to get
a job or an education or into medical school."

1512
01:54:32,033 --> 01:54:34,995
"And I knew that they had
somehow known it too -

1513
01:54:35,160 --> 01:54:40,498
they: Those patient, stubborn men
who argued and wrote and fought...

1514
01:54:40,582 --> 01:54:44,127
...and came up with the Constitution
and the Bill of Rights."

1515
01:54:44,210 --> 01:54:49,297
"They knew that the tree is known by its fruit,
and that injustice corrupts a tree...

1516
01:54:49,380 --> 01:54:54,092
...that its fruit withers and shrivels and
falls at last to that dark ground of history...

1517
01:54:54,175 --> 01:54:57,220
...where other great hopes
have rotted and died...

1518
01:54:57,304 --> 01:55:02,807
...where equality and freedom remain still the
only choice for wholeness and soundness...

1519
01:55:02,891 --> 01:55:04,975
...in a man or in a nation."

1520
01:55:09,437 --> 01:55:13,940
- Your father would have liked you to say that.
- Not enough of us realise it, Ma.

1521
01:55:14,024 --> 01:55:16,108
Time's getting short.

1522
01:55:16,818 --> 01:55:19,777
Not enough people,
and the time's running out.

1523
01:55:21,447 --> 01:55:23,906
- You mean Kathy?
- Notjust Kathy.

1524
01:55:25,449 --> 01:55:29,453
All the Kathys. Everywhere.

1525
01:55:31,412 --> 01:55:33,829
You know something, Phil?

1526
01:55:33,913 --> 01:55:36,750
I suddenly want to live to be very old.

1527
01:55:36,833 --> 01:55:38,334
Very.

1528
01:55:38,417 --> 01:55:43,046
I want to be around to see what happens.
The world is stirring in very strange ways.

1529
01:55:43,129 --> 01:55:46,381
Maybe this is the century for it,
and that's why it's so troubled.

1530
01:55:46,465 --> 01:55:48,716
Other centuries had their driving forces.

1531
01:55:48,799 --> 01:55:53,262
What will ours have been
when men look far back to it one day?

1532
01:55:53,720 --> 01:55:59,433
Maybe it won't be the American century after
all. Or the Russian century or atomic century.

1533
01:55:59,517 --> 01:56:02,936
Wouldn't it be wonderful
if it was everybody's century...

1534
01:56:03,019 --> 01:56:07,940
...when people all over the world -
free people - found a way to live together?

1535
01:56:08,941 --> 01:56:13,735
I'd like to be around to see
some of that, even the beginning.

1536
01:56:14,861 --> 01:56:18,197
- I may stick around for quite a while.
- {y: I}(front door slams)

1537
01:56:18,864 --> 01:56:20,950
Hi, Dave.

1538
01:56:37,127 --> 01:56:40,839
Hello? Mr Case? Dave Goldman calling.

1539
01:56:40,922 --> 01:56:45,343
I'm sorry to call you at this late hour,
but I can take thatjob.

1540
01:56:45,425 --> 01:56:49,179
I'm bringing my family
from California immediately.

1541
01:56:49,263 --> 01:56:51,347
I've got a house.

1542
01:56:51,430 --> 01:56:53,516
Thanks. So am I.

1543
01:56:57,936 --> 01:57:00,728
She's gonna live up there
all summer at her sister's.

1544
01:57:00,812 --> 01:57:05,566
And if anybody dishes anything out,
she'll be right there to dish it back.

1545
01:57:09,694 --> 01:57:13,531
Yes, sir. I think I'll
stick around for a long time.

1546
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,084
Thanks, Dave.
