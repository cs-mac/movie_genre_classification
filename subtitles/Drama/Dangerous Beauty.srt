DOES SHOW...

496
00:34:19,518 --> 00:34:22,521
HER RAIMENT
AS THE MOON DOTH GLOW.

497
00:34:24,523 --> 00:34:26,525
HER WISDOM...

498
00:34:26,525 --> 00:34:29,027
HER WISDOM SHINES
BRIGHT AS...

499
00:34:29,027 --> 00:34:31,029
ENVIOUS DAY.

500
00:34:31,029 --> 00:34:32,531
HER WIVES,

501
00:34:32,531 --> 00:34:36,034
LIKE BOOTY ARE...

502
00:34:36,034 --> 00:34:38,537
LOCKED AWAY.

503
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:42,040
BRAVA, BRAVA!

504
00:35:10,777 --> 00:35:13,780
NEVER EVER
HIDE THAT FACE AGAIN.

505
00:36:52,796 --> 00:36:54,298
CHILDREN, MY DEAR,
ARE A DEFICIT.

506
00:36:54,298 --> 00:36:57,301
IT'S NOT INFALLIBLE,

507
00:36:57,301 --> 00:37:00,304
BUT IT'S MORE COMFORTABLE
THAN A TURTLE SHELL.

508
00:37:00,304 --> 00:37:02,806
MMM.

509
00:37:03,307 --> 00:37:05,309
OHH.

510
00:37:05,309 --> 00:37:06,310
MMM.

511
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:09,313
SO...

512
00:37:12,316 --> 00:37:14,318
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
EVERYTHING.

513
00:37:14,318 --> 00:37:16,320
HOW COULD I?

514
00:37:22,826 --> 00:37:25,329
THEY WON'T ALL
BE RAMBERTIS.

515
00:37:32,336 --> 00:37:34,463
WHO'S NEXT?

516
00:37:58,987 --> 00:38:00,989
HONOR US WITH A POEM,
SIGNORA VERONICA.

517
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:01,990
I WOULD BE TOO HUMBLED

518
00:38:02,491 --> 00:38:05,494
BEFORE SO ELOQUENT
A GATHERING OF MINDS.

519
00:38:05,494 --> 00:38:06,995
MAKE US LAUGH
AS YOU DID BEFORE.

520
00:38:07,496 --> 00:38:08,997
PERHAPS IF I AM
CLEVER NEXT TIME,

521
00:38:08,997 --> 00:38:10,499
I SHALL
MAKE YOU WEEP.

522
00:38:10,499 --> 00:38:11,500
YOU SHALL
MAKE ME WEEP

523
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,001
IF YOU DO NOT
GIVE ME LEAVE

524
00:38:13,001 --> 00:38:14,002
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

525
00:38:14,002 --> 00:38:15,003
THURSDAY?

526
00:38:15,003 --> 00:38:17,005
EVERY THURSDAY?

527
00:38:17,005 --> 00:38:20,008
I SHALL COUNT
THE HOURS IN BETWEEN.

528
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:23,011
SCRAPE ANY LOWER,

529
00:38:23,011 --> 00:38:25,514
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE SHOES
FOR EARRINGS.

530
00:38:25,514 --> 00:38:27,516
WHY, MARCO VENIER,

531
00:38:27,516 --> 00:38:29,518
I DO BELIEVE
YOU'RE JEALOUS.

532
00:38:29,518 --> 00:38:32,020
ONE CAN ONLY BE JEALOUS
OF WHAT ONE CANNOT HAVE.

533
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:34,022
AND YOU CANNOT HAVE ME.

534
00:38:34,022 --> 00:38:36,024
THERE'S NOT A WOMAN
IN VENICE I CAN'T HAVE.

535
00:38:36,024 --> 00:38:37,025
AND THERE'S NOT
A MAN IN VENICE

536
00:38:37,526 --> 00:38:39,027
THAT I CAN'T HAVE.

537
00:38:39,027 --> 00:38:41,530
WE ARE SO ALIKE,
YOU AND ME.

538
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:44,533
WE BOTH KNOW THAT LOVE
IS INCONVENIENT

539
00:38:44,533 --> 00:38:47,035
IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE.

540
00:38:47,035 --> 00:38:50,539
SO WHY NOT ENJOY
WHAT LITTLE WE'RE ALLOWED

541
00:38:50,539 --> 00:38:52,040
TOGETHER?

542
00:38:57,045 --> 00:38:59,047
I'M ALL BOOKED UP.

543
00:39:10,058 --> 00:39:12,060
WELL?

544
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:14,062
WELL, WHAT?

545
00:39:14,062 --> 00:39:15,564
AHH.

546
00:39:21,069 --> 00:39:23,572
WELL, I SEE THAT YOU'RE
ENJOYING YOURSELF.

547
00:39:23,572 --> 00:39:25,574
YES. THANK YOU,

549
00:39:26,575 --> 00:39:29,578
OTHERWISE YOU SHALL
MAKE ME FEEL VERY OLD.

550
00:39:29,578 --> 00:39:30,579
OH, LET ME HELP YOU.

551
00:39:30,579 --> 00:39:32,581
NO, NO, NO.
IT'S NOT A SIGHT

552
00:39:32,581 --> 00:39:34,583
FOR SUCH BEAUTIFUL EYES.

553
00:39:34,583 --> 00:39:37,085
I'M NOT AFRAID OF FLESH.

554

IT'S SAID HIS COLLECTION
OF PAINTINGS

561
00:40:23,006 --> 00:40:26,009
IS SURPASSED ONLY
BY HIS COLLECTION OF WOMEN.

562
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:27,511
SO MANY?

I TELL YOU NOW,
HE'S IN LOVE WITH YOU.

THOUGHT IT A DISEASE.

I WANT YOU FOR MYSELF.

00:40:43,443 --> 00:40:45,445
I WOULD NOT PRESUME.

PITY.

571
00:40:46,446 --> 00:40:47,447
I WAS FLATTERED

572
00:40:47,447 --> 00:40:49,908
TO THINK YOU MIGHT HARBOR
SUCH SUSPICIONS

573
00:40:49,908 --> 00:40:51,368
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

574
00:40:51,368 --> 00:40:53,370
I WOULD BE HAPPY

00:42:14,618 --> 00:42:15,619
LOOK AT THESE GOWNS.

00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:19,122
EACH IS A UNIQUE WORK
OF ART IN EVERY DETAIL.

I'VE SEEN BETTER.

593
00:43:14,136 --> 00:43:18,140
MUST BE INTERESTING,
BEING IN A ROOM FULL OF MEN,

594
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:20,142
MOST OF WHOM YOU'VE SEEN
WITH THEIR PANTS DOWN.

595
00:43:20,142 --> 00:43:23,145
PUTS IT ALL IN SOME
KIND OF PERSPECTIVE.

596
00:43:25,647 --> 00:43:29,151
I WAS WONDERING, UM...

597
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:32,154
I WOULD ENJOY IT
IF PERHAPS WE MIGHT

598
00:43:32,154 --> 00:43:36,158
EXCHANGE VERSE AGAIN...
SOME NIGHT...

WE'RE BOTH COURTIERS,

00:43:55,177 --> 00:43:56,178
OF COURSE.

WHAT WAS COUSIN MAFFIO
ON ABOUT?

WELL, THE HUNT
POSSESSES, DOESN'T IT,

607
00:44:27,209 --> 00:44:29,211
SUCH A CRUEL BEAUTY?

608
00:44:29,211 --> 00:44:31,713
MUCH LIKE YOUR OWN.

609
00:44:31,713 --> 00:44:33,215
IS MY BEAUTY CRUEL?

610
00:44:33,715 --> 00:44:35,217

TO THOSE
THAT YOU REFUSE, YES.

612

IT IS ONLY MY REFUSAL
THAT AROUSES YOUR LONGING.

SAY YES

616
00:44:47,729 --> 00:44:50,732
AND THEN SEE
IF YOU'RE RID OF ME.

617
00:44:50,732 --> 00:44:52,234
I HEARD "SEE."

618
00:44:52,234 --> 00:44:56,738
IF I'M RIGHT,
YOU'LL TIRE OF ME,

619
00:44:56,738 --> 00:44:59,741
AND IF YOU'RE RIGHT,
I'LL TIRE OF YOU.

MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST
STAY AS WE ARE.

I DO REGRET THE...

THAT I CAUSED YOU.

623
00:45:19,761 --> 00:45:21,763
YOU OWN MY HEART.

624
00:45:30,272 --> 00:45:31,773

IS HIGHER UP.

OF LOMBARDY,

IS THE POPE'S NIECE.

627

AN ALLIANCE WITH THIS FAMILY

MARCO, YOU WILL MARRY
GIULIA DE LEZZE.

629
00:45:49,833 --> 00:45:52,336
FOR VENICE,
IF FOR NO OTHER REASON.

630
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:04,765
IF I DIDN'T KNOW YOU
BETTER,

631
00:46:04,765 --> 00:46:07,267

GO ON, SON.
TELL THE TRUTH

633
00:46:14,274 --> 00:46:15,192
AND SHAME THE DEVIL.
