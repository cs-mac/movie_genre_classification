MILKA - A movie based on
Timo K. Mukka's novel TABU

4
00:01:12,098 --> 00:01:22,011
Directed by: Rauni Mollberg

5
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:27,005
God, grant me love

6
00:02:29,033 --> 00:02:33,095
Grant me what my heart 
yearns for

7
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:42,011
Grant me fruits 
to fill my soul's chalice

8
00:02:45,008 --> 00:02:49,003
Grant me flowers 
for the pleasure of my eyes

9
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:15,002
Grant me what I want

10
00:03:22,048 --> 00:03:29,040
But not that which might be 
a burden for my small hands;

11
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:32,095
Anguish for my heart;

12
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:41,005
Trouble for my mother.

13
00:04:36,073 --> 00:04:40,033
Ojanen will return to our place
with Milka.

14
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,042
Stay further back.

15
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:54,099
You'll lose your legs 
if you get in the way.

16
00:06:10,056 --> 00:06:15,095
- You're too big to frolic.
- I'm not a big girl.

17
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:53,050
Don't be sad, 'Christ'.

18
00:08:01,074 --> 00:08:03,098
Take this...

19
00:08:06,037 --> 00:08:09,004
Little Milka.

20
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:44,003
Milka...

21
00:09:44,012 --> 00:09:46,095
What are you holding?

22
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:05,099
Keep it.

23
00:10:10,016 --> 00:10:14,003
Keep it, if it's so dear to you.

24
00:10:56,016 --> 00:10:58,007
Dear God,

25
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,048
Suffering has penetrated my heart.

26
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:10,029
Come, God, and take it from me.

27
00:11:10,032 --> 00:11:13,003
Lead me not into temptation,

28
00:11:13,016 --> 00:11:16,052
But deliver me from evil.

29
00:11:16,054 --> 00:11:18,082
Protect your child,

30
00:11:19,008 --> 00:11:22,095
So she might not prove herself
guilty of sin and shame.

31
00:11:24,065 --> 00:11:28,095
And so she might not bring
sadness to her mother's chest.

32
00:11:32,075 --> 00:11:35,092
Grant me light;

33
00:11:35,098 --> 00:11:39,001
Grant me purity.

34
00:12:39,042 --> 00:12:41,049
MilkaÉ

35
00:12:43,016 --> 00:12:45,015
Come here.

36
00:13:18,074 --> 00:13:22,007
How miserable if it rains
every day in the summerÉ

37
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:31,019
It feels melancholy to have to wait
for winter after a summer like this.

38
00:14:12,097 --> 00:14:16,003
And yet, it is a good thing 
that it rains.

39
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:20,099
It flushes the earth,

40
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:25,094
It cleanses the earth.

41
00:14:31,052 --> 00:14:34,086
If we had no rain...

42
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:38,019
We'd have no sun either.

43
00:14:44,032 --> 00:14:48,095
One must have everything, 
little Milka.

44
00:15:20,072 --> 00:15:25,095
Milka, the rain isn't stopping
and the hay is going to go bad.

45
00:15:27,033 --> 00:15:31,053
You'd better run to Ojanen and ask

46
00:15:31,058 --> 00:15:35,008
What we should do with the hay.

47
00:15:39,046 --> 00:15:43,005
What would be... for the best.

48
00:16:07,012 --> 00:16:11,096
Put father's hat on Ð
otherwise your hair will get wet.

49
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:27,001
It's still a good hat.

50
00:16:31,012 --> 00:16:33,096
It hasn't been spoiled by mould.

51
00:17:22,048 --> 00:17:25,099
I came to dry my clothes.

52
00:17:47,065 --> 00:17:50,097
Why won't you fix the roof, 
'Christ'?

53
00:17:52,008 --> 00:17:55,005
No need to when it's not raining.

54
00:17:56,041 --> 00:18:01,011
- And when it's raining I can't.
- Yes you can.

55
00:18:05,008 --> 00:18:08,035
What shall we do with the hay?

56
00:18:08,038 --> 00:18:12,001
It'll get spoiled by the rain.

57
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:15,024
Nothing you can do about it.

58
00:18:15,024 --> 00:18:18,059
Can't move it inside 
when it's raining.

59
00:18:18,064 --> 00:18:23,022
You just have to 
wait for it to stop.

60
00:18:23,024 --> 00:18:26,099
Mother sent me.

61
00:18:41,052 --> 00:18:44,007
Did you have time to tell her...?

62
00:18:44,016 --> 00:18:47,032
I'm not a kid.

63
00:18:47,033 --> 00:18:53,028
Well I'm not a little girl,
but many boys' prick-tease.

64
00:18:56,096 --> 00:19:03,005
Tilulilu lilulilu tilulilu littuun.
Tilulilu lilulilu tilulilu lei.

65
00:19:06,084 --> 00:19:13,046
Can't I stay here until the rain stops
so I can go home without getting wet?

66
00:19:13,046 --> 00:19:16,098
No.

67
00:19:45,089 --> 00:19:50,008
I miss father.

68
00:19:58,073 --> 00:20:01,086
Father has been granted peace.

69
00:20:01,089 --> 00:20:05,006
He's in comfort.

70
00:20:06,002 --> 00:20:10,099
- We have no reason to be sad.
- I just miss him.

71
00:20:12,081 --> 00:20:15,098
Everyone must walk 
the path of death once.

72
00:20:23,008 --> 00:20:26,008
Deliver some butter to Laanila.

73
00:20:26,008 --> 00:20:29,007
I don't want to go there.

74
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:35,006
Fine, little Milka.

75
00:20:37,042 --> 00:20:41,002
I'll go by myself.

76
00:22:56,029 --> 00:23:03,041
Oh Jesus, the bliss of my life.

77
00:23:03,062 --> 00:23:10,062
With eternal mercy 
for your children.

78
00:23:10,067 --> 00:23:24,024
You died for me so that 
I could live.

79
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:31,006
When I get sinful thoughts,

80
00:23:31,008 --> 00:23:38,017
And they darken my spirit,

81
00:23:38,021 --> 00:23:45,020
Then let me be at the base 
of your cross

82
00:23:45,026 --> 00:23:51,088
To remember your death.

83
00:24:01,084 --> 00:24:05,071
Here's something for Milka.

84
00:24:05,086 --> 00:24:09,099
- Thanks.
- Though she'll soon be a big girl.

85
00:24:10,012 --> 00:24:15,007
How they grow up! Our Auno, too.

86
00:24:15,008 --> 00:24:18,005
He's a big man now.

87
00:24:21,024 --> 00:24:24,066
He just stays there and plays.

88
00:24:30,004 --> 00:24:36,002
You have that Ojanen 
as your field hand.

89
00:24:37,047 --> 00:24:40,044
What's he like?

90
00:24:40,051 --> 00:24:44,066
Everyone knows him, 
that 'Christ-Devil'.

91
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:48,000
A damned good labourer.

92
00:24:48,008 --> 00:24:50,003
Yes, he is.

93
00:25:24,042 --> 00:25:27,012
Come with me, Milka.

94
00:25:27,012 --> 00:25:30,009
There's a frog in the drying barn.

95
00:25:44,051 --> 00:25:48,011
Where is this frog?

96
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:58,056
Auno, kissing is sinful.

97
00:25:58,062 --> 00:26:02,098
You must think hard before 
doing such a thing.

98
00:27:57,031 --> 00:28:00,016
Come have a cup of coffee.

99
00:28:14,008 --> 00:28:18,011
I don't care for coffee. 
It's not healthy.

100
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:21,015
But you've had it before.

101
00:28:22,008 --> 00:28:24,077
Isn't it good 
if I don't drink it so much?

102
00:28:24,082 --> 00:28:27,098
It's expensive.

103
00:28:34,018 --> 00:28:36,097
Fine, Milka.

104
00:28:49,022 --> 00:28:51,028
Milka, what if

105
00:28:51,031 --> 00:28:54,094
Ojanen were to repair 
the cold bedroom?

106
00:28:55,008 --> 00:28:59,010
You could have it for yourself 
at some point.

107
00:29:00,059 --> 00:29:04,028
My husband 
would have finished it.

108
00:29:04,029 --> 00:29:07,011
He was a fine carpenter.

109
00:29:10,061 --> 00:29:14,095
But not as good as you.

110
00:29:15,004 --> 00:29:18,069
I'll have to think about it.

111
00:29:18,074 --> 00:29:22,009
Take your time.

112
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:28,005
Milka,

113
00:29:28,008 --> 00:29:32,064
Would you sleep in the 
cubby house tonight?

114
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:36,005
It will surely be a warm night.

115
00:30:49,046 --> 00:30:54,049
'Christ', wait up.
I'll be your wife.

116
00:30:56,025 --> 00:31:00,011
You're the only one I care about.

117
00:31:03,032 --> 00:31:06,010
Little Milka, you're so young.

118
00:31:06,068 --> 00:31:11,007
I want you, please.

119
00:31:15,078 --> 00:31:18,046
You can't get married 
for many years.

120
00:31:18,086 --> 00:31:21,058
By the time you can,
you'll have changed your mind.

121
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:24,099
You'll find some other fine man.

122
00:31:25,004 --> 00:31:28,096
You'll understand 
once you become a woman.

123
00:31:29,086 --> 00:31:32,078
Don't you care for me 
even a little bit?

124
00:31:32,081 --> 00:31:37,020
And even if you didn't change your
mind, I still wouldn't want you.

125
00:31:37,023 --> 00:31:39,069
I'll keep on living 
the same old way.

126
00:31:39,072 --> 00:31:43,007
It's what's best for me.

127
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:24,074
Dear God,

128
00:32:24,077 --> 00:32:29,010
There's a fire in my chest 
that won't go out,

129
00:32:31,053 --> 00:32:36,005
And I won't ask you to put it out.

130
00:32:39,052 --> 00:32:43,099
I want you to let it keep on burning.

131
00:32:45,081 --> 00:32:50,018
You'd grant me a heart 
full of goodness and luck.

132
00:32:53,055 --> 00:32:57,007
And you would grant him to me.

133
00:32:59,097 --> 00:33:03,093
I'd thank you for that, God Ð

134
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:09,094
Forever and ever.

135
00:35:04,065 --> 00:35:08,012
Take your clothes off, Milka.

136
00:35:30,004 --> 00:35:36,012
Little Milka, you've been quiet.
You're a woman now.

137
00:35:38,008 --> 00:35:44,009
Mother, you've never told me
how to become a woman.

138
00:35:48,097 --> 00:35:52,005
Now you know, little Milka.

139
00:36:10,012 --> 00:36:13,003
You're one beautiful girl.

140
00:36:16,016 --> 00:36:19,099
Not even a princess 
can match you.

141
00:36:20,081 --> 00:36:24,046
There's no match for you here...

142
00:36:24,051 --> 00:36:28,004
Though one shouldn't 
say it out loud.

143
00:36:28,008 --> 00:36:31,008
People can be so jealous.

144
00:36:34,058 --> 00:36:39,003
- You could stay here.
- I should go warm up the house.

145
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:30,092
I wish you were my girl, Milka.

146
00:37:30,096 --> 00:37:35,044
I'd make a cradle for you and 
rock you in it.

147
00:37:35,049 --> 00:37:39,004
I'm a big girl already.

148
00:38:03,012 --> 00:38:06,003
The bed is still too big for you, 
Milka.

149
00:38:06,012 --> 00:38:09,001
You'll grow still.

150
00:38:16,016 --> 00:38:25,007
It's the right of the bedmaker to sleep
in the new bed for the first night, right?

151
00:38:27,056 --> 00:38:30,099
That's right.

152
00:40:01,092 --> 00:40:06,022
Don't I still have... 
beautiful legs?

153
00:41:51,036 --> 00:41:54,003
I wish you knew, little Milka.

154
00:41:55,031 --> 00:41:58,091
I wish you knew 
what a great day it is today Ð

155
00:42:01,008 --> 00:42:04,010
How well I feel.

156
00:42:09,008 --> 00:42:14,005
Milka, deliver some butter 
to Laanila today.

157
00:42:30,003 --> 00:42:33,082
Ojanen may change his shirt.

158
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:37,002
It needs to be washed.

159
00:42:42,086 --> 00:42:46,015
I'll give you another one.

160
00:42:56,018 --> 00:43:00,095
You could bring all your dirty
clothes here to be washed.

161
00:43:02,078 --> 00:43:06,094
They could be washed with
the small amount we have.

162
00:44:19,016 --> 00:44:22,010
May God bring peace to this house.

163
00:44:23,016 --> 00:44:26,013
Good day, Cantor Malmstrm.

164
00:44:28,026 --> 00:44:31,006
Do you know Ojanen?

165
00:44:32,025 --> 00:44:35,092
He's made all kinds
of things for us...

166
00:44:35,096 --> 00:44:40,017
A new room, a new bed,

167
00:44:40,025 --> 00:44:43,084
A rocking chair...

168
00:44:43,092 --> 00:44:49,010
Oh, so he's a 
capable carpenter then?

169
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:15,009
A good shepherd says
'Tuku, tuku... tukuÉ'

170
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:53,028
Oh dearest Jesus, come swiftly Ð

171
00:45:53,034 --> 00:45:58,094
come into my heart.

172
00:45:59,002 --> 00:46:06,054
From me the sorrow and suffering take,

173
00:46:06,059 --> 00:46:12,019
And bring me comfort.

174
00:46:12,021 --> 00:46:17,095
You know best

175
00:46:18,004 --> 00:46:23,094
What I need here.

176
00:46:24,004 --> 00:46:30,052
Forgive me my sins,

177
00:46:30,058 --> 00:46:37,002
And give peace to the tormented.

178
00:46:54,008 --> 00:46:59,010
Go ahead and borrow a horse
whenever you need one.

179
00:47:06,083 --> 00:47:10,014
Merry Christmas.

180
00:47:10,018 --> 00:47:13,000
Merry Christmas.

181
00:48:05,016 --> 00:48:12,088
How brightly shines 
the morning star.

182
00:48:12,091 --> 00:48:29,096
He brought the light, grace
and truth to the skies.

183
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:38,057
You holy son of David Ð

184
00:48:38,073 --> 00:48:46,093
My king supreme Ð

185
00:48:47,008 --> 00:48:56,008
You won me over.

186
00:48:56,020 --> 00:49:03,069
Jesus, Jesus,

187
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:11,068
My only one, my beloved,

188
00:49:11,082 --> 00:49:17,080
The bringer of hope.

189
00:49:17,086 --> 00:49:30,004
I only yearn for you,
the shelter of solace.

190
00:49:36,012 --> 00:49:40,041
On this earth, sins are given
the most beautiful names:

191
00:49:40,046 --> 00:49:44,036
Pride is called honour;

192
00:49:44,043 --> 00:49:46,095
Adultery is called love;

193
00:49:47,008 --> 00:49:50,007
Greed is called frugality;

194
00:49:50,008 --> 00:49:53,099
And beauty is called the
protection of the body.

195
00:49:54,008 --> 00:49:58,093
But the curtains of Satan 
are elegant and soft.

196
00:49:58,098 --> 00:50:05,032
The worst enemy lives 
within a Christian's own flesh.

197
00:50:05,036 --> 00:50:10,037
Only Lord Jesus can 
but with a single word

198
00:50:10,042 --> 00:50:13,099
heal our hearts,

199
00:50:14,008 --> 00:50:16,048
cleanse our feelings

200
00:50:16,051 --> 00:50:22,011
and put an end to all bodily
and spiritual troubles.

201
00:50:23,038 --> 00:50:27,078
But God's love 
is like that of a mother's.

202
00:50:27,082 --> 00:50:32,081
It's like an inexhaustible 
ocean of love,

203
00:50:32,083 --> 00:50:38,011
bringing with it 
bliss and suffering.

204
00:50:38,018 --> 00:50:42,092
We're all on our way to eternity.

205
00:50:42,097 --> 00:50:48,038
Be with us, Lord Jesus,

206
00:50:48,042 --> 00:50:53,095
As evening has come
and the sun is going down.

207
00:51:15,032 --> 00:51:18,008
This is for you.

208
00:53:14,012 --> 00:53:18,001
'Christ', do you want to get dry?

209
00:53:24,076 --> 00:53:28,004
You're not a woman yet.

210
00:53:30,070 --> 00:53:34,046
I'm different from last summer.

211
00:53:34,053 --> 00:53:40,005
I know you're unlike 
all the other men.

212
00:53:43,021 --> 00:53:47,048
I can give you everything you want.

213
00:55:19,034 --> 00:55:21,099
Why didn't he come?

214
00:55:24,016 --> 00:55:28,003
He'll come, but not today.

215
00:55:37,057 --> 00:55:40,098
Has he been... offended?

216
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:48,095
Did he give you a reason?

217
00:55:49,023 --> 00:55:53,004
I don't know. Go and ask him.

218
00:55:59,030 --> 00:56:03,017
That's what I should do.

219
00:56:09,008 --> 00:56:11,099
Keep in mind that he's a good man.

220
00:56:13,058 --> 00:56:17,061
- There's no-one like him.
- I know.

221
00:56:17,066 --> 00:56:21,005
There isn't.

222
00:56:29,073 --> 00:56:34,012
This is for you, little Milka.

223
00:58:28,048 --> 00:58:32,005
May God bring peace to you, 
virgin Milka.

224
00:58:33,065 --> 00:58:36,030
Perhaps Ojanen ought to go home.

225
00:58:36,033 --> 00:58:41,007
I have something important
to discuss with this widow.

226
00:59:03,052 --> 00:59:07,040
I'm asking you, 
widow Anna Siekkiniemi:

227
00:59:07,045 --> 00:59:11,000
Would you become my spouse?

228
00:59:44,033 --> 00:59:51,006
Little Milka, what would you think
if I became your new father?

229
01:00:54,090 --> 01:00:57,095
Guess what he said...

230
01:00:59,029 --> 01:01:02,094
He wants to marry me.

231
01:01:10,072 --> 01:01:16,006
Where did he get the idea 
that I'd accept him Ð

232
01:01:16,008 --> 01:01:19,002
An old man?

233
01:01:29,088 --> 01:01:36,004
He doesn't need a wife, 
even for bodily needs.

234
01:01:44,064 --> 01:01:48,099
Would you want me to have him?

235
01:01:51,026 --> 01:01:54,006
No.

236
01:01:56,090 --> 01:02:00,072
I promised to answer 
in a month's time.

237
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:16,053
I hope Ojanen didn't get mad
at us because of the cantor.

238
01:02:18,034 --> 01:02:21,099
Can anyone work better 
than Ojanen?

239
01:02:22,064 --> 01:02:25,003
That's the thing.

240
01:02:27,090 --> 01:02:32,046
- There's no-one like him.
- I can go and get him back.

241
01:02:32,052 --> 01:02:36,037
Very well, Milka. Do that. 
Run after him.

242
01:02:36,043 --> 01:02:39,012
I'll talk to him.

243
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:41,094
Mother asked you to come.

244
01:05:02,097 --> 01:05:07,008
You can do to me
what you did on Christmas.

245
01:05:09,094 --> 01:05:13,024
I know you like it.

246
01:05:15,081 --> 01:05:19,003
I can take it.

247
01:05:56,032 --> 01:05:58,088
God,

248
01:05:58,091 --> 01:06:02,003
From heaven you explore my paths.

249
01:06:03,038 --> 01:06:07,011
You live within my heart, God.

250
01:06:12,008 --> 01:06:16,029
Grant joy to my mother's chest.

251
01:06:16,032 --> 01:06:19,093
Grant joy to my mother's eyes.

252
01:06:20,004 --> 01:06:23,013
Wipe away her tears.

253
01:06:24,072 --> 01:06:28,046
Grant her what she wants.

254
01:06:28,050 --> 01:06:32,052
Don't deny it from her.

255
01:06:32,058 --> 01:06:36,003
And grant me what I want.

256
01:06:37,047 --> 01:06:40,014
Let me sleep next to him;

257
01:06:40,016 --> 01:06:42,099
He whom my heart loves.

258
01:06:45,082 --> 01:06:49,065
Thank you for all the good days.

259
01:06:49,072 --> 01:06:52,099
Protect me from evil

260
01:06:54,044 --> 01:06:57,003
When you can.

261
01:06:57,012 --> 01:07:00,015
Everything happens 
according to your will.

262
01:07:02,085 --> 01:07:06,021
I love you 
from the bottom of my heart.

263
01:08:17,004 --> 01:08:20,095
In spring when women 
desire men the most.

264
01:08:22,008 --> 01:08:25,099
The men pursue 
a particular matter.

265
01:08:31,028 --> 01:08:33,020
Well...

266
01:08:34,084 --> 01:08:37,077
It's been over a month.

267
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:41,001
I'm waiting for your answer, widow.

268
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,020
My heart lacks 
that feeling for you

269
01:08:46,025 --> 01:08:49,003
That is required in marriage.

270
01:08:57,050 --> 01:09:02,008
Have you given it 
serious consideration?

271
01:09:02,070 --> 01:09:05,016
Yes.

272
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:13,003
Well then.

273
01:09:16,008 --> 01:09:18,011
Well then.

274
01:09:28,041 --> 01:09:31,015
Perhaps this is how 
I'll be rejected

275
01:09:31,020 --> 01:09:33,099
Just as I rejected 
that cantor.

276
01:09:36,002 --> 01:09:38,043
Well...

277
01:09:38,043 --> 01:09:43,001
Rejected the cantor... 
can't have the priestÉ

278
01:09:45,008 --> 01:09:49,004
I'll have someone far better, 
if I can.

279
01:09:51,032 --> 01:09:56,006
Perhaps you'll have a new
father soon, little Milka.

280
01:11:12,012 --> 01:11:15,016
'Christ', don't you 
care about me after all?

281
01:11:15,017 --> 01:11:17,098
Why are you rejecting me?

282
01:11:18,020 --> 01:11:22,058
I won't reject you, little Milka.

283
01:11:22,062 --> 01:11:24,027
What's happened?

284
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:27,030
You'll take mother 
as your wife anyway.

285
01:11:27,038 --> 01:11:30,005
Take me.

286
01:11:41,049 --> 01:11:44,020
Milka.

287
01:11:44,022 --> 01:11:48,011
Tell me, is blood still
coming out from within you?

288
01:11:51,034 --> 01:11:54,003
Not any more.

289
01:11:54,003 --> 01:11:57,017
Aren't you happy about that?

290
01:12:09,087 --> 01:12:13,007
Yes... I am.

291
01:12:32,086 --> 01:12:35,003
'Christ'.

292
01:12:39,012 --> 01:12:41,007
Come.

293
01:14:39,008 --> 01:14:44,053
- Do you still have that coin
I gave you in the summer? - Yes.

294
01:14:45,048 --> 01:14:49,013
Put it inside this ball.

295
01:14:49,013 --> 01:14:52,008
Seal it tight;

296
01:14:53,012 --> 01:14:55,099
It won't open any more.

297
01:16:03,056 --> 01:16:06,061
Did he promise to 
come and visit?

298
01:16:08,083 --> 01:16:11,065
He didn't say.

299
01:16:16,082 --> 01:16:21,005
I hope nothing's...
happened to him.

300
01:17:07,012 --> 01:17:09,065
What's inside?

301
01:17:09,069 --> 01:17:11,060
I don't know.

302
01:17:11,066 --> 01:17:13,099
It won't open.

303
01:17:19,085 --> 01:17:23,007
Perhaps he'll tell me.

304
01:17:25,034 --> 01:17:27,045
Probably.

305
01:17:36,076 --> 01:17:39,092
Anna Siekkinen doesn't 
come here very often.

306
01:17:39,096 --> 01:17:45,000
- Where's she going now?
- There's so much to do.

307
01:17:47,053 --> 01:17:50,022
We'll go visit Ojanen.

308
01:17:50,024 --> 01:17:52,099
It's probably a waste of time.

309
01:17:53,057 --> 01:17:57,015
He borrowed a horse and cart 
from us yesterday.

310
01:17:57,020 --> 01:18:01,021
Must've gone to village 
to sell his works.

311
01:18:01,041 --> 01:18:04,007
He's a capable man.

312
01:18:06,044 --> 01:18:10,054
He's been an essential help 
for us for many years.

313
01:18:12,050 --> 01:18:15,099
It would be great if you could ask 
him to come by when you see him.

314
01:18:16,051 --> 01:18:20,095
We won't do anything 
if he's late.

315
01:20:39,097 --> 01:20:42,065
Do you want anything to eat, 
mother?

316
01:21:11,004 --> 01:21:15,014
- How's everyone doing here?
- Well, thanks.

317
01:21:25,082 --> 01:21:30,002
I've been having a headache. 
I don't know why.

318
01:21:30,012 --> 01:21:32,038
Right.

319
01:21:32,038 --> 01:21:36,022
We haven't heard anything 
about the former field hand.

320
01:21:36,022 --> 01:21:38,076
We lost a horse and a cart.

321
01:21:38,078 --> 01:21:41,057
It doesn't matter much.

322
01:21:42,043 --> 01:21:44,097
Go, Milka. 
Make her a cup of coffee.

323
01:21:44,099 --> 01:21:47,084
Thanks.

324
01:21:47,088 --> 01:21:50,050
You don't have to.

325
01:22:02,019 --> 01:22:06,074
Auno ought to help you

326
01:22:06,074 --> 01:22:09,030
With the hayfield.

327
01:22:09,034 --> 01:22:13,099
And with other things...
if you need anything.

328
01:22:37,088 --> 01:22:42,046
- I came to help.
- We don't need help.

329
01:22:46,083 --> 01:22:49,095
Have you heard anything

330
01:22:50,002 --> 01:22:52,051
About 'Christ-Devil'?

331
01:22:54,044 --> 01:22:59,002
What about yourself? Have you?

332
01:23:03,071 --> 01:23:07,056
Perhaps your mother would
like to hear about him.

333
01:23:09,052 --> 01:23:12,056
Didn't she sleep with him 
at your place?

334
01:23:15,008 --> 01:23:18,050
Soon we'll catch 'Christ-Devil'.

335
01:23:19,048 --> 01:23:22,042
He'll end up in prison.

336
01:23:22,045 --> 01:23:28,001
Who told you about Christ-Devil 
and mother? Tell me.

337
01:23:28,008 --> 01:23:30,033
It's the talk of the town.

338
01:23:30,038 --> 01:23:35,000
I will bring to justice 
anyone who shames my mother.

339
01:23:38,070 --> 01:23:41,054
But it's true.

340
01:23:42,038 --> 01:23:44,058
Anyway,

341
01:23:45,082 --> 01:23:48,037
You know it.

342
01:23:49,092 --> 01:23:55,054
We don't need Laanila's help.
We'll get by on our own.

343
01:23:55,062 --> 01:23:58,059
But I won't...

344
01:24:16,061 --> 01:24:20,015
Why didn't you want Auno inside?

345
01:24:21,012 --> 01:24:24,053
You can see he's 
in love with you.

346
01:24:24,054 --> 01:24:27,058
I don't care for him.

347
01:24:44,033 --> 01:24:47,010
Good night, Milka.

348
01:25:25,090 --> 01:25:28,057
Milka...

349
01:25:28,064 --> 01:25:31,060
Milka...

350
01:25:35,001 --> 01:25:38,092
With whom have you been?

351
01:25:38,096 --> 01:25:42,000
What, mother?

352
01:25:59,016 --> 01:26:02,066
You've spread your legs!

353
01:26:10,090 --> 01:26:13,099
You've given yourself!

354
01:26:16,072 --> 01:26:19,076
You'll have a child.

355
01:26:19,082 --> 01:26:25,007
I didn't know.
I didn't know.

356
01:26:36,098 --> 01:26:39,058
With whom?

357
01:26:39,063 --> 01:26:42,062
Tell me, with whom?

358
01:26:46,072 --> 01:26:50,006
Say with Auno.

359
01:26:51,068 --> 01:26:55,071
Have you been with Auno?

360
01:26:55,076 --> 01:27:01,004
With nobody. I swear.

361
01:27:05,052 --> 01:27:10,004
Goddamnit... you're lying!

362
01:27:10,012 --> 01:27:12,061
With whom, then?

363
01:27:12,065 --> 01:27:15,030
- For the love of God, with whom?
- I didn't know.

364
01:27:15,032 --> 01:27:18,092
- With whom?
- I didn't know.

365
01:27:18,098 --> 01:27:22,053
I didn't know.

366
01:27:26,098 --> 01:27:31,014
Is that why 'Christ' 
left and abandoned us?

367
01:27:33,014 --> 01:27:35,098
Abandoned us in shame?

368
01:27:37,004 --> 01:27:40,009
Left me alone.

369
01:27:41,049 --> 01:27:44,064
Left me alone.

370
01:27:55,016 --> 01:27:58,005
I didn't know.

371
01:28:23,044 --> 01:28:26,036
Mother...

372
01:28:26,044 --> 01:28:29,056
Mother...

373
01:28:31,012 --> 01:28:34,045
I haven't sinned.

374
01:28:34,050 --> 01:28:37,068
I've committed no sin at all.

375
01:28:40,035 --> 01:28:43,055
Do you believe me, mother?

376
01:28:44,074 --> 01:28:47,069
I swear.

377
01:28:49,039 --> 01:28:51,097
Do you believe me, mother?

378
01:28:53,064 --> 01:28:56,070
I believe you,

379
01:28:57,036 --> 01:29:00,022
My child.

380
01:29:07,012 --> 01:29:09,040
God.

381
01:29:09,044 --> 01:29:14,002
You've concealed 
your secrets from me,

382
01:29:14,081 --> 01:29:19,073
You haven't given me 
your knowledge.

383
01:29:19,081 --> 01:29:23,074
Suffering has penetrated 
our chests.

384
01:29:23,077 --> 01:29:28,048
Sorrow has settled in our house.

385
01:29:28,052 --> 01:29:32,002
Laughter has vanished 
from our house.

386
01:29:37,076 --> 01:29:40,024
God...

387
01:29:40,028 --> 01:29:45,038
Why won't you let the sun 
shine into our souls?

388
01:29:45,044 --> 01:29:49,021
Why do you abandon us?

389
01:29:49,023 --> 01:29:53,002
Why do you forget your children?

390
01:30:40,090 --> 01:30:43,062
Milka,

391
01:30:49,012 --> 01:30:52,095
You'll give birth to 
a child of Christ-Devil,

392
01:30:53,004 --> 01:30:56,097
But I'll marry you.

393
01:30:58,069 --> 01:31:02,008
I don't care about you.

394
01:31:04,012 --> 01:31:07,020
You can make love to me.

395
01:31:07,023 --> 01:31:10,098
You can have me here.

396
01:32:38,078 --> 01:32:45,010
Virgin Milka, 
can I walk with you for a bit?

397
01:32:58,094 --> 01:33:03,022
The birth of a child is 
God's grace.

398
01:33:03,022 --> 01:33:06,094
A great gift.

399
01:33:06,097 --> 01:33:11,008
It was not granted to me.

400
01:33:50,069 --> 01:33:53,016
I wish you were my girl...

401
01:33:53,016 --> 01:33:57,005
You'd bring flowers to my grave.

402
01:33:58,043 --> 01:34:02,016
You can make love to me.

403
01:34:02,018 --> 01:34:05,072
You can have me here.

404
01:34:10,020 --> 01:34:12,082
I wouldn't dare!

405
01:34:12,091 --> 01:34:15,097
A pious manÉ

406
01:34:17,090 --> 01:34:21,018
But Milka hasn't been

407
01:34:21,024 --> 01:34:23,099
With anyone.

408
01:34:27,053 --> 01:34:30,021
But Milka hasn't been

409
01:34:30,025 --> 01:34:32,099
With anyone.

410
01:34:35,071 --> 01:34:39,066
But something has happened.

411
01:34:43,024 --> 01:34:46,057
But we can probably right it.

412
01:34:46,061 --> 01:34:50,013
The cantor is a good person, mother.

413
01:34:50,016 --> 01:34:53,062
He is a good person.

414
01:34:59,082 --> 01:35:02,086
Am I not good,

415
01:35:02,092 --> 01:35:06,006
Little Milka?

416
01:35:24,003 --> 01:35:28,059
You built this for me and Milka.

417
01:35:28,064 --> 01:35:32,059
There's none other like it.

418
01:35:32,064 --> 01:35:36,062
Sometimes I miss him.

419
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,037
Still...

420
01:35:43,045 --> 01:35:46,067
There's no hope.

421
01:35:55,016 --> 01:35:57,011
I wonder what's inside?

422
01:35:57,018 --> 01:36:03,042
He's hidden a secret in there.

423
01:36:03,050 --> 01:36:06,057
He was a beautiful man.

424
01:36:06,062 --> 01:36:10,062
Curiosity leads to punishment.

425
01:36:11,076 --> 01:36:15,095
...his guidance...

426
01:40:20,013 --> 01:40:22,017
Look, my boy.

427
01:40:22,021 --> 01:40:25,026
Don't cry.

428
01:40:25,031 --> 01:40:28,073
This is a table.

429
01:40:28,076 --> 01:40:32,051
Look, a table.

430
01:40:33,074 --> 01:40:37,017
Well, naturally 
he's ignorant of it.

431
01:40:37,023 --> 01:40:41,023
A table. That's right.

432
01:40:41,029 --> 01:40:46,005
He'll learn once he grows up.

433
01:40:51,058 --> 01:40:56,000
This here. It's a book.

434
01:40:56,092 --> 01:40:59,095
A book, indeed.

435
01:41:00,002 --> 01:41:02,057
He doesn't understand yet.

436
01:41:02,065 --> 01:41:06,019
Of course not.

437
01:41:06,025 --> 01:41:09,098
A beautiful child.

438
01:41:30,012 --> 01:41:33,032
Into pieces, God...

439
01:41:33,037 --> 01:41:36,050
Into pieces, 
they tore my heart...

440
01:41:36,056 --> 01:41:40,059
And sucked the blood 
out of my veins.

441
01:41:44,064 --> 01:41:49,023
But I passed by you 
with joy in my heart...

442
01:41:49,024 --> 01:41:51,036
Once the suffering had passed.

443
01:41:51,036 --> 01:41:56,056
And once again my heart was full,
as if it were full of milk.

444
01:42:02,053 --> 01:42:06,061
I took my heart in my own hand,

445
01:42:06,066 --> 01:42:10,015
I explored my paths 
with my own eyes,

446
01:42:11,076 --> 01:42:15,030
With my own lips 
I kissed my wounds,

447
01:42:15,034 --> 01:42:18,062
And healed my suffering.
