00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,200
I heard you have an attachment to this house?

10
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,890
When I was young, there was a time I've lived alone in this house for a few days.

11
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:56,980
At that time, I had the memories of happiness and warmth.

12
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:01,360
So even after becoming an adult and I'm in the house alone,

13
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,780
my heart feels at ease here.

14
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:08,150
Yes, so you are still living in this house alone?

15
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,920
Recently, some woman has started coming here.

16
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,930
After that woman flipped this house upside-down,

17
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:25,550
she ruined the innate meaning of the house.

18
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:30,370
After that woman came to this house,

19
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:33,520
I've come to be uncomfortable and dislike

20
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,830
being in this house alone.

21
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:37,290
Yes...

22
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,350
I've come to want to be together with that person.

23
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:50,790
<i> Episode 14 <br> Sorry for not being cool. </i>

24
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,700
<i> Episode 14 <br> Thanks for not being cool.</i>

25
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,630
Let's...

26
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:05,790
How about a cool relationship?

27
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,620
-What? <br> -Let's just do the dating.

28
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,040
Not the marriage.

29
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,950
Who are you?

30
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,190
I told you not to laugh.

31
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:29,470
I really want to be different this time.

32
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:34,480
Until now, with just the desire to be together,

33
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,140
I thought that was all it took and put everything into it.

34
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:41,020
Then, in the end, I messed everything up.

35
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:44,760
I even got a criminal record and was labeled a stalker.

36
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,780
That's because your partner was Lee Hoon Dong.

37
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,810
Yeah.

38
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,210
This time, it is Gong Gi Tae.

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,040
This time, I really don't want to mess things up.

40
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:03,750
Let's just keep our relationship secret for a while.

41
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,530
If our parents know, the house will flip over again.

42
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:13,430
I'm saying we shouldn't prematurely<br> let our parents find out and hurt them even more.

43
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:17,600
First, we should fix what we messed up.

44
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,030
We should put the hospital back in place,

45
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:23,600
and I should find my place, too.

46
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,950
Your mother, because of me staying by your side, thinks it

47
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:29,730
is because of the money.

48
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,960
We can resolve the misunderstanding.

49
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,680
No.

50
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,930
If I don't change, the misunderstanding will never get resolved.

51
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,460
When people know about the relationship between you and me,

52
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,920
I hate hearing them calling me Cinderella.

53
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,390
After earning money and becoming a dutiful daughter to my mom and dad,

54
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:50,460
I want to stand by your side proudly.

55
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,940
But you...

56
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,290
You're like kimchi stew.<br> <i>(Eating Kimchee Stew by yourself is an <br>expression that means getting ahead of yourself.)</i>

57
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:07,620
-Huh? <br> - Did someone say that they would marry you?

58
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:16,700
Even when a person's not thinking of that, you're already so hasty.

59
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,590
Here. Just start drinking wine.

60
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,220
Cheers.

61
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,930
I drank it all.

62
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,370
I have said everything I was going to say.

63
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:37,760
I'll go home.

64
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,550
Hey! Hey!

65
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:41,940
You're already leaving?

66
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,980
Why are you in such a hurry?

67
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,750
You, for that matter... Why are you in such a hurry?

68
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,300
I am leaving.

69
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,870
Hey! Hey! Wait a minute.

70
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:52,770
I'll escort you home.

71
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:57,160
Don't be clingy. I said we should date coolly.

72
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,720
I...

73
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,800
I have to hear that, not from just any person, but from you?

74
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,450
Bye.

75
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:19,310
♬<i> Your face flickers before me today </i>♬

76

79
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,460
Good morning!

80
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:39,040
Director. The client who posted badly about you deleted it.

81
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,710
- How did you do it? <br> - Oh that?

82
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:45,810
I had another scene maker that was <br>even better than the running scene maker.

83
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,820
-Excuse me? <br> -Nothing.

84
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:53,440
Anyway, I told you it was a transient breeze that you should coolly pass over.

85
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,430
How is the surgery schedule for today?

86
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:00,140
There is still no one yet.

87
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:04,230
I'm sure we'll recover soon.

88
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:08,380
Let's not lose confidence, but let's proceed in a cool way.

89
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,220
Fighting!

90
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:16,700
Drink the juice, Hyeon Hee.

91
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,030
Give me coffee.

92
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,400
You said to give you juice.

93
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,460
You said you read in a book that caffeine is bad for you.

94
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:32,820
In this book, I read it's worse to have stress from suppressing a desire to eat something.

95
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:38,370
You should study less. A smart woman has no charm.

96
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,560
There is no other blockhead like you!

97
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,460
-Mom. <br> -Mother-in-law.

98
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:48,100
Why did you follow him and then sit here?

99
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,030
You are occupying the best seat.

100
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:53,790
I'm lonely at home, and there are no customers in the restaurant.

101
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:57,070
The problem is that there are no customers. That is what I want to say.

102
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:00,880
I thought you would grow up after getting married, but you found someone just like you...

103
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,830
You two are playing well. Playing well.

104
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,270
In the future, fend for yourselves.

105
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:08,430
I am going to stop your allowances and start receiving the restaurant's rent, starting this month.

106
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,890
Between mother and son, we should calculate accurately.

107
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,150
Mom.

108
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:14,890
Hey Lee Hoon Dong, I am hungry.

109
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:17,150
Hello, Mother.

110
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:22,970
It's well into lunch time, and your only customers are your family and your friend?

111
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:27,670
I'm not sure if you're running a business <br>or running a neighborhood love house...

112
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:33,100
Oppa, I will leave as well.

113
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,600
Okay.

114
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,360
Go home safely.

115
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:41,640
-Call me when you get home. <br> -Okay.

116
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,870
Why are you like this?

117
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,640
-What? <br> -Is there something good?

118
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,630
Not really.

119
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,900
-Are you okay? <br> -Yeah.

120
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,260
I am okay.

121
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,450
What.

122
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:04,760
You can't see me.

123
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,070
What?

124
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,830
My wife left!

125
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,260
Come in.

126
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,490
Tada.

127
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:25,430
Wow, it is nice.

128
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,750
Yeo Reum.

129
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,840
Sit.

130
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,390
I have something to say to you.

131
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:44,330
I am seeing Gong Gi Tae.

132
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:48,970
-But...?<br>-If I have to keep seeing you, I thought I should tell you.

133
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:52,320
Did I ever ask you to date me? I asked to work with you.

134
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,810
Like always, so cool.

135
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:01,230
I haven't told Gong Gi Tae I am working with you yet.

136
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:04,120
If I tell him coolly, will he understand coolly?

137
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,180
We decided to coolly date.

138
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,370
- Coolly? <br> - Yeah.

139
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,260
In a cool way.

140
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:12,320
What can I do to be cool like that? Teach me.

141
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,670
Then end it.

142
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:17,330
-What? <br> -If you like him, how can you be cool about it?

143
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:19,580
Although you can act cool.

144
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:26,600
Don't worry. I am not acting cool now. I am really cool.

145
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,930
Because it has ended.

146
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:31,750
Look at this. You really are cool

147
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:35,560
if you can say that without feeling anything.

148
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,760
I need to learn. I will attend to you as my teacher.

149
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,480
Do you think anyone can do it if they learn how?

150
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,060
It's almost time for the investor to arrive.

151
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,510
The investor?

152
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,940
Oh, the one that was a secret?

153
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,450
- Unnie! <br> - Huh?

154
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:55,520
Hyeon Hee!

155
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:02,480
The investor hidden behind the veil was you?

156
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,560
I'm sorry I hid it from you. I had to keep it from Hoon Dong.

157
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,440
Why? You already got married.

158
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,180
It's because I'm married to him that I'm keeping this a secret.

159
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,800
He'll be upset if I fill up a different pocket.

160
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,470
Why do you need another pocket?

161
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,960
My husband's family money is <br>my husband's family's money. It isn't my money.

162
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,750
If I want it to become my money, I have to do emotional labor for the next 30 years and act all charming.

163
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,560
Before that happens I have to take care of myself.

164
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,420
That's how I can confidently give my mother an allowance.

165
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:30,620
Like usual, my Hyeon Hee is diligent.

166
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:34,140
I spent all the money I saved up before my marriage.

167
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,960
We <i>have</i> to be successful, Unnie.

168
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:44,720
Can't you two do this without me? And I could bow out?

169
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,350
Why?

170
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:50,090
-That...<br>-She's a little hesitant because of her boyfriend.

171
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:53,740
You've got a boyfriend? Who?

172
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:56,860
The one you're hesitant about...

173
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:01,180
By chance, is it Gong Gi Tae?

174
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,640
Your so diligent, too.

175
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,770
Really? That's good.

176
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:08,400
If you two were going to stick together, why go through all that fuss?

177
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,370
Keep this a secret from Gong Gi Tae.

178
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:15,010
If he knows, it's only a matter of time before Hoon Dong finds out and it becomes difficult for me too.

179
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:17,160
That doesn't make sense. How can I keep this from him?

180
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,070
Why not? I'm keeping it from my husband...

181
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:20,550
Even so...

182
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,660
The store sign came!

183
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,150
Lets go out, too.

184
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:32,800
Here it is.

185
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,830
Thank you.

186
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:38,330
What's this?

187
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:42,870
Since we first decided to start this business, we planned to include you in it.

188
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,000
Why are you two insisting on me...

189
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,580
Are you touched?

190
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:50,390
What kind of old-fashioned restaurant name is this?

191
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,230
So, who told you to have such an old-fashioned name?

192
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:57,030
I even put your name on the sign.Are you really not going to do it?

193
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:02,400
Please pass this on to Joo Jang Mi.

194
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,480
Everything on the Internet was deleted.

195
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,260
We should do what that child wants.

196
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,010
Jang Mi didn't have that motive.

197
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:10,420
Instead, she helped me.

198
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:13,060
When Jang Mi was convincing that woman,

199
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,560
that's what you saw and misunderstood.

200
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,830
Oh, so Jang Mi was trying to help you?

201
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:23,380
Are you two still meeting?

202
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:27,100
<i>The fact that we're meeting each other, lets keep it a secret for a little while.<i></i></i>

203
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,010
We're not meeting, but

204
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:31,860
I, alone, like her and am clinging onto her.

205
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,960
That man... is she still seeing him?

206
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:39,520
That man also... if you calculate it, she met him because of me.

207
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:44,560
How badly did I act for her to need someone to lean on?

208
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,010
Oh, our pitiful Gi Tae..

209
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:50,310
You lost your love and are regretful about your actions...

210
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:56,680
And the man kept cheerfully putting himself forward, with his smiling eyes, so Jang Mi just accepted it appropriately.

211
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,800
Those two are definitely not in a serious relationship.

212
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,900
That's right. Jang Mi isn't the type to spit on a smiling face.

213
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,960
Anyway, Jang Mi and I are not in a relationship,

214
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,090
so please rid yourselves of any misunderstandings <br>or bad feelings about her.

215
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:13,090
She's a person that helped me that I'm grateful for,

216
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:15,470
and she's really a good woman.

217
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,770
I'm like that, too.

218
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:25,520
I'm sorry. Please wait.

219
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:33,590
Then, let's talk later.

220
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,290
Should we have a drink?

221
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:55,720
Your mother let you live by yourself like you wanted.

222
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,060
In the end she called you, and sat you down,

223
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,460
and must have meddled in your life.

224
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:03,650
When she lived her whole life like that,

225
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:07,090
would she change so easily? <br> I understand you.

226
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:11,350
How you had your heart taken away <br>by a woman like Joo Jang Mi.

227
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,190
How suffocated must you have felt.

228
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:18,250
We need space in which to breathe.

229
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:23,200
It may not have been an advisable method,

230
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,210
but I looked for a realistic and reasonable alternative.

231
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:31,430
Anyway, love and marriage are completely separate issues.

232
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:36,190
Love requires unending change and trembling,

233
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:39,320
but marriage requires stability.

234
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:44,490
So, did you get stability from Mother? And from

235
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:47,640
that woman did you get change and trembling?

236
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:52,280
At your age I thought of it as <br>being something that didn't make sense, either.

237
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:58,100
But having lived it, life originally <br>is something that doesn't make sense.

238
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,450
They may be slightly sad lives,

239
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:04,680
but they aren't bad lives.

240
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,770
What do you really want to say?

241
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:15,690
Marry a woman like Kang Se Ah,

242
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:20,440
and keep Joo Jang Mi as a lover <br>so that your mother doesn't know.

243
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:38,230
At one point in time, I tried to understand you, Father.

244
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:41,150
How bad must it have been that he did it?

245
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:44,160
Even though you said that you had someone else you love,

246
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,940
why did Mother hold onto you and not let you go?

247
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,500
But now I see it.

248
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:57,680
The one who held on and didn't let go was you.

249
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,970
If I only thought about myself, I would have let her go.

250
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:06,940
But there is a responsibility associated with <br>our social class and position. And the heaviness of

251
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:11,620
that kind of burden... you know what it feels like.

252
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:17,180
So, that's why you made a fuss about living alone.

253
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,230
You're right.

254
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:24,660
I am your son and am selfish, like you.

255
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:33,090
It's such an embarrassing thing...

256
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:34,370
Today is the first time I realized it.

257
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:35,630
Gi Tae.

258
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:40,100
But, Jang Mi is different from that woman.

259
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,610
So don't treat them the same way.

260
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:11,360
Oh? You came?

261
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,920
What's this?

262
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,900
Oh, taste it and I'll request your evaluation.

263
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,800
They are my "Run for it, Joo Jang Mi" <br>toddling (first try sample) products.

264
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,090
You do such preposterous things so well.

265
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:25,140
When did you prepare this? Wow...

266
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,620
How is it?

267
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:36,010
It's delicious.

268
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:39,430
What a relief! I was worried about your reaction.

269
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:40,870
After this?

270
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:45,230
If it suits the taste of a picky eater like Gong Gi Tae, whose palate is tuned to the skills of the cooking goddess, Mrs. Shin,

271
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:49,980
it would fit a normal person's taste.

272
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,940
But you invented all these?

273
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,050
No, the chef did.

274
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:58,380
The chef? Who is the chef?

275
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,270
Han Yeo Reum.

276
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,820
Han Yeo Reum?

277
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,690
Han Yeo Reum and I

278
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:13,660
ended all emotions coolly, with certainty.

279
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,500
We decided to coolly date.

280
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:22,270
No... I didn't know this is what you meant by coolly dating.

281
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:25,850
In reality, you know all about my past, <br>and I know all about your past.

282
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:28,490
Now, instead of pretending not to know,

283
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:30,800
bringing out what happened in the past and acknowledging it...

284
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,360
Isn't that considered coolly dating?

285
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:39,050
I, too, will acknowledge you and Kang Se Ah being friends.

286
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,750
Please believe me.

287
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:46,100
If I still had any feeling for Han Yeo Reum

288
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:49,390
I wouldn't have been able to tell you truthfully.

289
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:52,450
If you tell me truthfully, do I have to understand everything?

290
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:54,770
I also thought it over a lot.

291
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:59,900
Since we became real, I thought about not working with Han Yeo Reum...

292
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,390
But, since my feelings for you have become real,

293
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:05,760
I need this work even more.

294
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,230
I told you that I don't like to be Cinderella.

295
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:12,930
I, too, want to be a supportive person.

296
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:19,650
If you are really uncomfortable, <br>I will cleanly put it out of my mind.

297
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:22,940
If you tell me not to, I won't do it.

298
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,620
<i>Please pass this on to Joo Jang Mi.</i>

299
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:32,430
<i>Marry someone like Kang Se Ah and just date Joo Jang Mi.</i>

300
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,030
Do it.

301
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:40,270
-Do it?<br>-I think I kind of understand what you're trying to say.

302
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:43,610
Your way of thinking...

303
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:45,700
I will support it.

304
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,770
As usual, Gong Gi Tae is so cool.

305
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,220
Oh, drink, drink, drink.

306
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,380
Instead, you have to make sure to be successful.

307
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,900
Here.

308
00:19:55,900 --> 00:20:01,070
To our cool dating.

309
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:03,560
Drink.

310
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:11,690
We are opening tomorrow, <br>so buy flowers and be sure to come by.

311
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:14,750
-Okay?<br>-Okay.

312
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:17,280
Eat this, too.

313
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,480
You came? What do you want to eat today?

314
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,150
-I don't really have an appetite. <br>-You were so excited that you were flying around,

315
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:33,400
and today you look like you're about to <br>dig yourself a grave and enter it.

316
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,700
What's making your mood swings so abrupt?

317
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,490
Is there a problem with your hospital?

318
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,190
Or... woman?

319
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:48,620
She isn't cool to anyone else but me. <br>What do you think about this?

320
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,100
So it's a woman. Is she pretty?

321
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,630
You'll be surprised if you see her.

322
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:58,310
Introduce me. If a woman tries to back out on you awkwardly,

323
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:01,250
you have to create witnesses for her actions, first and foremost.

324
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,810
Should I? Should I introduce her to you?

325
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:09,100
Let's see. How beautiful is this woman that <br>she has Gong Gi Tae held by her fingertips?

326
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:16,130
Welcome.

327
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:17,990
Congratulations on opening your business.

328
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:21,920
Ms. Joo Jang Mi and Ms. Nam Hyun Hee <br>made real trouble this time.

329
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,700
Please come this way.

330
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,890
This is the menu. Please look it over.

331
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:36,270
- What's the best dish here? <br>- Our kimchi quatro pancakes are good, <br>and the makgeolli (rice wine) is really good too.

332
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:38,380
Welcome.

333
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:43,210
-Welcome Hyung! <br> -Oh, hey, Congrats. You're pretty good and proper.

334
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:46,530
Chef-nim! You have to keep my working here <br>a secret from my oppa, okay?

335
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:49,880
Yes, I know. Zip!

336
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,430
- Let's go sit. <br> - Okay, lets go.

337
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:53,400
This one is good, too.

338
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,740
Oh, hello!

339
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:59,490
There aren't any seats available. Would you mind sitting together?

340
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:02,020
-Ah, this is our manager. <br>-This is Chef Uhm Dae Sik.

341
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:05,030
Hello.

342
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:07,150
I will bring the food right out.

343
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:30,850
Gong Gi Tae!

344
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:35,000
Lee Hoon Dong.

345
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,780
Oh, introduce yourself. Ah,

346
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:40,290
you guys have already met, right?

347
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:46,900
Ah, what's this? The woman you said <br>you were meeting was Joo Jang Mi?

348
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:50,360
Ah, I told you to keep this a secret. <br>Why did you bring Lee Hoon Dong here?

349
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,450
What? Why, why!? What are you hiding, <br>what are you hiding, huh?!

350
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:55,320
I would have been the first to congratulate you two <br>if you had told me you were dating.

351
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,310
- Let's go in. <br> - Wait!

352
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:59,920
We are not ready yet.

353
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,920
-But it's already full of customers inside... <br>-Oh, you're right. So, there aren't any seats available.

354
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,640
Oh, you came?

355
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:10,250
Oh, hey, Han Yeo Reum. Congratulations.

356
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:14,450
- Thank you.<br>- Hey Han Yeo Reum. How dare you betray us <br>and grab hold of Joo Jang Mi?!

357
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:16,530
Unnie! The wine-makgeolli...

358
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:21,520
Nam Hyun Hee, what are <i> you</i> doing here?!

359
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,350
Wait. So, one of the friends you said <br>you are opening the business with is...

360
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:27,830
Oppa...

361
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:32,560
Yah, seriously, where is the end to your plot twists!?

362
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,220
Oppa!

363
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,300
You guys had to come here and...

364
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,330
You should have told me.

365
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:44,060
-Come on in.<br>-Here. Congratulations.

366
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:46,430
Thanks.

367
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:48,690

-Han Yeo Reum. You don't need to be scared, man. <br>-About what?

381
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:01,460
I don't care <i>at all</i> that you're Jang Mi's business partner,

382
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:05,440
so you don't need to be worrying about <br>what I would think, or anything like that, at all.

383
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,860
- Yes. <br> - Instead, my Jang Mi

384
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:11,760
shouldn't be worked <i>too</i> hard. Alright? Hm?

385
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,610
Yes.

386
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,820
Alright, alright, alright.

387
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:27,430
Congratulations on the opening.

388
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:29,990
Se Ah, how did you know?

389
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:33,660
I called her. Se Ah's hospital is nearby. I'm actually full of connections,

390
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,990
and I will pull in <i>lots</i> of customers for you.

391
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:39,600
I heard you two are dating. Congratulations on that, too.

392
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,690
Yes.

393
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:45,170
Ah, sit here with Gong Gi Tae.

394
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:50,120
Please buy from us a <i>lot</i>, Se Ah!

395
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:55,650
Oh, I'm just <i>so</i> happy to see her!

396
00:25:55,650 --> 00:26:00,990
Ah, this is <i> so</i> pretty! Oops, how did I do this?

397
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:06,350
Oh my gosh, I'm just so thankful. <br>Eat a lot. Have a lot of food, okay?

398
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:11,040
Han Yeo Reum, let's see how well you cook, then.

399
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:14,040
I need to know if I can trust my Jang Mi to your cooking skills.

400
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:35,540
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by the Forget Dating, Give Me The Ring! Team</i>

401
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:42,900
You were really cool today. You were really <br>manly and awesome in front of Han Yeo Reum.

402
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:47,280
You, too. In front of Se Ah

403
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,660
you were so completely confident.

404
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:52,490
Was I? Ha ha.

405
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:57,920
Yeah, well.

406
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:06,960
<i>As we've begun real dating, we've tried to <br>care for each other sincerely</i>

407
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,310
<i>and become cool, </i>

408
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:14,640
<i>but sometimes our conversations become shorter and shorter than when we were fake dating.</i>

409
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,420
Let's go to your house.

410
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:31,990
My house? <br> Yeah, your house.

411
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:47,770
Then, I will wash up first.

412
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:51,490
Oh, okay. Okay, okay, okay. Here.

413
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:10,220
Gong Gi Tae, don't you have another toothbrush?

414
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:12,650
Toothbrush?

415
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,890
Here.

416
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:18,850
- Thank you. <br> - Is there anything else you need?

417
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,730
Try using this.

418
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:24,580
What's this?

419
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:31,830
Oh, it's nice on my skin.

420
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:38,250
But... until when are you going to stand there?

421
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,240
I'm about to take a shower.

422
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,730
Oh, right, right, right, right, right.

423
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:52,240
I'm refreshed. My skin feels so soft.

424
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:03,370
Oh, my legs.

425
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,200
Do your legs hurt?

426
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,480
I'm used to standing up all day, <br>thanks to my job at the department store.

Oh, they're swollen.

429

It's okay.

430
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:21,660

♬<i> Starting from tomorrow, we will live happily together </i>♬

471
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:28,650
It looks like there are some customers going in and out.

472
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,850
Look at Joo Jang Mi, laughing because she likes it.

473
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,380
And in front of Han Yeo Reum.

474
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:38,170
Hey, can Hyeon Hee be like that even when she's pregnant?

475
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:43,800
#$%^! <br>She pinky promised that <br>she was only going to work at the counter.

476
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:55,200
Those heavy things like that... Shouldn't Joo Jang Mi, <br>who is very strong, be carrying that stuff?

477
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,130
Hey, how is Joo Jang Mi strong?

478
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,600
You haven't been punched by Joo Jang Mi?

479
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:00,590
Aigo, aigo, have you been punched?

480
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:03,510
Have you been pounded on the street!?

481
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,400
I went through it! Is that something you even pay attention to?

482
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,640
Hey, hey, why would I not have doubts? <br> - What are you talking about?

483
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:11,620
You don't know what I'm going through!

484
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,140
We don't have any patients today, either?

485
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:35,010
No, Director.

486
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:52,680
Yes, please come in.

487
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,470
It's you.

488
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:12,170
You were waiting for patients, huh?

489
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,140
What do we do?

490
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:17,220
Should I get some filler injections?

491
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:21,110
Lets eat.

492
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:30,900
Joo Jang Mi is doing so amazingly well.

493
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,850
You have strength, too.

494
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:35,980
Take this opportunity to come over to our hospital.

495
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,600
For a long time, my father

496
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:42,040
has had his heart set on recruiting you. <br>You know it too, right?

497
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,460
This time, we're introducing skills with a 3D printer.

498
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:47,360
What do you think? Doesn't it tempt you a bit?

499
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:53,370
You're always responding with that scaredy-cat face <br>whenever I try to tempt you.

500
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:56,190
I'm not trying to tempt you as a woman, <br>so please stop being nervous.

501
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:58,300
As a friend, and as a doctor,

502
00:35:58,330 --> 00:36:00,530
I'm scouting you.

503
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,430
Whatever it's come to,

504
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:07,740
relying on you isn't good form.

505
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:11,160
I think it's definitely not the time for you to be acting so cool.

506
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:14,420
No matter what, you have to get back up.

507
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:25,280
What? Scout?

508
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:29,100
That's right. And Kang Se Ah's scouting, at that.

509
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,380
But why, when he's got his perfectly good hospital?

510
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,210
These days, Gi Tae's hospital isn't so good.

511
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:36,660
-He said that it had recovered. <br> - No.

512
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:41,290
It's such a sensitive neighborhood, when it comes to gossip, that it takes a little time once it falters.

513
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,880
Gi Tae will need something to break through that, too.

514
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,150
I didn't know that.

515
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:47,280
Why didn't he tell me?

516
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,760
Since you look like you're sprouting wings and flying, <br>his pride was probably hurt, and that's why.

517
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,700
Anyway, Jang Mi, what are you going to do?

518
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,510
Are you okay with Gi Tae going to Se Ah's hospital?

519
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:59,000
Of course! It's for Gong Gi Tae's future, <br>so I have to be cool and understand it.

520
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:02,050
Aigo, really. Joo Jang Mi is cool.

521
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:05,510
I'm not the me from before.

522
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:11,720
But Gong Gi Tae's plastic surgery practice... To have prepared it so well,

523
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:15,070
and to just give it up, is a bit wasteful.

524
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:20,390
Not Gong Gi Tae but the hospital, the hospital.

525
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:22,330
Hospital...

526
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:57,360
- Yeah? <br> - Oh...

527
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,180
It's me.

528
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,040
You know, umm.

529
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:03,050
I'm a bit busy now. Is it urgent?

530
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,780
Oh, no. If you're busy go back to work.

531
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,610
Sorry. I'll call you later.

532
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:11,300
What is there to be sorry about? <br>It's not like that. It's perfectly okay.

533
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,500
Yeah, okay.

534
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:22,120
Look, you can't do it.

535
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,170
It's not a cool face but a depressed one.

536
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:33,560
Gong Gi Tae understood my working with you,

537
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,120
so I have to understand, too.

538
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:38,490
Even though I am a little disappointed he didn't <br>tell me that he was having trouble at the hospital,

539
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:43,170
he'll probably have done that, thinking of me. <br>So, I guess I have to understand.

540
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:46,960
When I was going to school,

541
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:51,100
the teacher said, if you couldn't understand something, <br>just memorize it.

542
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,650
You look like you're just memorizing it.

543
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:55,850
This makes you look stupid.

544
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:58,500
Go see Gi Tae and talk to him, face-to-face.

545
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:02,120
We have to work. The customers will be crowding us soon.

546
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:13,800
Daepo Fusion Restaurant,

547
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:16,350
Run for it Joo Jang Mi?

548
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:21,040
Mom, Mom!

549
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,190
I found it. <br> How's she doing?

550
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:25,990
- She's set up a shop.<br>- What?

551
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:28,880
Big Gun Fusion. Run for it Joo Jang Mi.

552
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,160
Really?

553
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:35,500
Hey, Jang Mi's pancake making skills justify that.

554
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:38,640
She found her way properly.

555
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,790
But we guessed wrong.

556
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:43,080
Guessed wrong?

557
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,990
Do you know who was next to her?

558
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:47,900
Who was next to her?

559
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:49,510
You surprised me.

560
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:51,260
Welcome!

561
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:25,470
Mother-in-law...

562
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:40,480
Have some makgeolli.

563
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:05,050
It's delicious.

564
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:07,560
Thank you.

565
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,030
I'm sorry for misunderstanding you.

566
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:12,920
No, it's okay. It was normal to misunderstand that situation.

567
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,890
My meddlesomeness was the true culprit.

568
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,340
But...

569
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:21,770
…I can't say thank you for helping, though.

570
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:30,280
If you really do not have feelings for Gi Tae,

571
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:34,590
isn't it courtesy to keep a distance?

572
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,570
Yes.

573
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:38,470
One more makgeolli, over here please.

574
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:40,720
Yes, I'm coming.

575
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:45,790
Don't worry too much. I don't have any <br>thoughts of blocking Gong Gi Tae's way.

576
00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:48,250
As you can see, I'm busy living my own life.

577
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:51,990
It's the first time life is so exciting and happy.

578
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:56,550
This is all thanks to Gi Tae and you.

579
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:59,250
Then, enjoy your meal.

580
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:04,470
- Here you go. <br> - Thank you.

581
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:06,680
Eat, eat, eat.

582
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:26,340
Only Gi Tae is left looking pitiful.

583
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:40,120
I'm back.

584
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,220
You came?

585
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:49,110
What are you looking at?

586
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:50,990
Ah...

587
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:54,500
It's a very interesting technique for plastic surgery, <br>using this 3D printer.

588
00:42:54,500 --> 00:43:02,310
You see, by printing a frontal view of the patient, <br>we can do a much more precise surgery than before, and...

589
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:04,680
Ah...

590
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:07,320
Not interesting, right?

591
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:11,570
-You know… <br> -Yeah?

592
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:15,100
<i>If I ask him about hospital stuff, his pride will be hurt, right?</i>

593
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:17,330
What?

594
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:19,430
Let's have some drinks.

595
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:20,680
Drinks?

596
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:24,180
Ah…right now… I have to look at this.

597
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:25,920
Ah…right.

598
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,960
Alright then, we can drink it later.

599
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,210
I'll put them in the fridge.

600
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:31,490
-Ok, then. <br>-Oh, yeah.

601
00:43:55,630 --> 00:44:00,900
♬<i> When I see you, my heart pounds and my lips dry up </i>♬

608
00:44:39,350 --> 00:44:42,170
Gong Gi Tae, are you not going to sleep?

609
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:44,740
I'm sleepy.

610
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:49,240
You're sleepy again? Whenever you see me, you're always sleepy.

611
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:54,710
Alright, go in first and sleep.

612
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:56,420
Hmm?

613
00:45:55,210 --> 00:46:01,320
Actually, today your mother came by the restaurant.

614
00:46:02,590 --> 00:46:06,420
I didn't tell her I was meeting you.

615
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:11,530
No… I couldn't say it.

616
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:20,220
Being confident, next to you,

617
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:22,660
is really hard.

618
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:49,780
The pancakes have come out. The pancakes.

619
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:52,380
-Ah thank you, I'll enjoy it.<br>- I'll enjoy it, Jang Mi.

620
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:54,310
Yes.

621
00:46:54,310 --> 00:46:59,250
But..you two..what are you talking about?

622
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:01,380
Hey Richard.

623
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,020
Hi.

624
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:09,620
Hello.

625
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:12,500
He came to our hospital on medical missions, Richard Bernstein.

626
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:15,020
He's helping us with the 3D printing skills.

627
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:17,830
My pleasure to meet you Dr. Bernstein.

628
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:20,500
I've heard a lot about you from Se Ah.

629
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:29,690
Richard, it seems like Japan has success in creating artificial bones using 3D printers.

630
00:47:29,690 --> 00:47:30,880
Yes, indeed.

631
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,160
Plastic surgeons all over the world are currently taking notice of that case.

632
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:37,930
All types of artificial bones do not fuse with patients all that well,

633
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:41,480
and they're also known to be causing inflammation quite frequently.

634
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:47,500
The newly developed ones do not go under rapid...

635
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,230
A guest came.

636
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:51,450
-It's nothing, not anything much. <br> -What are they saying?

637
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:55,860
More clinical tests are required for applications to the masses.

638
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:58,300
What is this?

639
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:02,410
This is Sundae (blood sausage).

640
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:07,960
Very good.

641
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:10,180
-It's delicious. <br>-What is this?

642
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:12,450
Popular? <br> Oh.

643
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:24,340
We like each other.

644
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:28,330
Why do we slowly have less to talk about?

645
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,550
Nothing changed here.

646
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:43,130
I don't have to give you anything to drink, right?

647
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:45,280
Your unfriendliness is the same too.

648
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,210
Why did you come?

649
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:52,720
I'm thankful for the $5000.

650
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:56,300
You don't have to repay it, already. You are making a fuss because your business is doing well.

651
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:57,960
Does it look like fussing to you?

652
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:00,760
You don't see Joo Jang Mi overdoing it?

653
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:04,020
You don't see her being overly considerate, <br>trying not to let you come to any harm?

654
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:06,400
I'm also trying to be very considerate of her,

655
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,550
because Jang Mi said that she didn't want to lean on me, <br>but stand up by herself.

656
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:12,060
It's not that you didn't give her certainty?

657
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:14,320
-What? <br> -"I can lean on this man."

658
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:17,820
"Even if I lean a bit, he's not one who will <br>pull out and run, away like other men."

659
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:21,350
As a man, you can't even give her that kind of certainty?

660
00:49:21,350 --> 00:49:23,040
This punk, really.

661
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,820
What do you know about Jang Mi?

662
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:26,470
I know Joo Jang Mi the best.

663
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:28,850
I know that Joo Jang Mi wants to be with you.

664
00:49:28,850 --> 00:49:32,900
I also know that she's working with me <br>to try to stay next to you longer.

665
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:37,360
Right now, is it true that you're next to her?

666
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,670
You're overstepping your bounds a bit today.

667
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:41,160
Why do I need to hear this from you?

668
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:43,910
Because I like you.

669
00:49:43,910 --> 00:49:48,770
When you like a person there aren't only <br>feelings like between a man and a woman.

670
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,450
Acting cool...

671
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:21,550
Ah, it hurts.

672
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:51,670
<i>Joo Gyung Po</i>

673
00:51:04,110 --> 00:51:09,190
<i>Fool… Idiot… Dog poop.</i>

674
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:25,100
What postcard? Who sent it?

675
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:28,250
Your dad is this kind of person.

676
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:34,430
<i>Fool… Idiot… Dog poop.</i>

677
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:40,100
He's an enemy that doesn't even know his place.

678
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:43,650
You said that by being pen pals <br>you were fated to be together.

679
00:51:43,650 --> 00:51:46,710
I was fooled by that smooth talk, <br>and I completely messed up my entire life.

680
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:51,580
Now that it's like this, why don't you also write back, <br>while thinking about the old times?

681
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:53,670
Forget it.

682
00:51:53,670 --> 00:51:55,500
Exactly when was it?

683
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:57,720
When was it that you stopped talking to each other?

684
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:01,900
Why does it matter when it started or who started it?

685
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:03,140
I don't remember anything.

686
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:08,450
It's just, once I closed my mouth I couldn't open it again.

687
00:52:09,550 --> 00:52:12,080
Love is like that...

688
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:15,720
The moment you close your mouth, it's the end.

689
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,360
Let's go inside.

690
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:20,550
I'll be back. I have to go somewhere.

691
00:52:20,550 --> 00:52:22,400
Jang Mi!

692
00:52:30,490 --> 00:52:32,690
Joo Jang Mi!

693
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,970
<i>"I can depend on this man." It's not because <br>you didn't give her that assurance?</i>

694
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:08,300
<i>- Yeah?<br></i>- Where are you?

695
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:09,500
- I'm home.<br> - I'm heading there right now.

696
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:11,010
No!

697
00:53:11,010 --> 00:53:12,590
Coming here right now is a bit troubling...

698
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:13,880
Why can't I?

699
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:16,040
Ah, something important happened, so see you later.

700
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:20,680
No! I definitely have to see you, right now.

701
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:32,850
Gong Gi Tae!

702
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:45,500
<i>The door has been opened.</i>

703
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:47,170
I told you not to come!

704
00:53:47,170 --> 00:53:49,880
- Right now...<br>- Why? What is so important that's happening?

705
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:51,040
It's something I didn't want to show to you.

706
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:54,230
I told you everything honest about me and Han Yeo Reum.

707
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:57,730
But why aren't you telling me your story?

708
00:54:03,330 --> 00:54:05,650
Who's inside?

709
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:07,310
I have a customer, so later...

710
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:08,650
Stop hiding things from me.

711
00:54:08,650 --> 00:54:11,220
Because whatever you're doing—I know it all.

712
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:13,380
You... you know?

713
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:16,290
How did you know?

714
00:54:16,290 --> 00:54:18,940
You really went all out, didn't you?

715
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:22,800
I really didn't want to go this far.

716
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:42,480
What are you doing?

717
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,290
You said you already knew. They're conducting an interview.

718
00:54:44,290 --> 00:54:45,100
A magazine?

719
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:48,350
The employees kept saying <br>we should improve our hospital's image.

720
00:54:48,350 --> 00:54:49,770
But why did you hide that from me?

721
00:54:49,770 --> 00:54:51,860
I was embarrassed!

722
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:55,290
I should be recognized for my skills. Making a living <br>by selling the image of a handsome, eligible doctor

723
00:54:55,290 --> 00:54:57,480
is all Mother's way of doing things.

724
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:00,430
So that was it.

725
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:02,770
But you <i>are</i> a handsome bachelor?

726
00:55:02,770 --> 00:55:06,530
Of course I am. You didn't know?

727
00:55:08,690 --> 00:55:11,620
Is this your girlfriend?

728
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:13,660
Ah, no, no. I am...

729
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:16,360
Yes, she's my girlfriend.

730
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:19,350
A handsome bachelor doctor having a girlfriend is a minus.

731
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:22,590
What if Mother sees?

732
00:55:22,590 --> 00:55:25,790
Please keep that off the record.

733
00:55:27,410 --> 00:55:28,450
How far were we in the interview?

734
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:30,890
After that girl started coming to this house,

735
00:55:30,890 --> 00:55:36,970
you said it was uncomfortable, and <br>you didn't like to be alone in this house.

736
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:43,460
He said that he wanted to be together.

737
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:49,800
Then, let's keep it off the record.

738
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:06,360
Now that it's become real, it's harder.

739
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:11,200
When we were being fake, it was comfortable to be by your side.

740
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,190
I said whatever I wanted to say, too.

741
00:56:13,190 --> 00:56:15,940
Now that we're real,

742
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:20,170
there are lots of things we can't be found out about.

743
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:23,700
I guess you wanted to look really good in front of me?

744
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:27,270
You're too late. Let's just do it comfortably.

745
00:56:27,270 --> 00:56:30,720
I've already seen everything I should and shouldn't see.

746
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:34,680
You're right. Since we already started over,

747
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:39,120
we should say everything we wanted to say before now.

748
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:41,610
You...

749
00:56:41,610 --> 00:56:46,610
Why didn't you tell me working at the hospital was hard?

750
00:56:49,130 --> 00:56:52,100
You think it is only you <br>who wants to act strong in front of me?

751
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:53,370
I am the same, too.

752
00:56:53,370 --> 00:56:58,210
Why did I even endure doing <br>that magazine interview that sells my face?

753
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:02,920
Instead of Han Yeo Reum,

754
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:08,500
I would like it if you depended on me.

755
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:15,660
I was always depending on you. You didn't know?

756
00:57:16,490 --> 00:57:21,440
During that time, because I slept on your shoulder <br>and dreamed in such sweet sleep,

757
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:25,580
it gave me the strength to run around all day, <br> to flip the Korean pancakes,

758
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:28,750
and be able to serve makgeolli (alcoholic rice beverage).<br>Didn't you know?

759
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:31,730
Was that so?

760
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:35,980
What else? Say more of what you want to say.

761
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:43,700
I understand your friendship with Kang Se Ah.

762
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:46,130
But,

763
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:50,410
being scouted by Kang Se Ah's hospital, I don't like it.

764
00:57:51,610 --> 00:57:54,490
How did you know that? Aigo.

765
00:57:54,490 --> 00:57:58,170
If you knew earlier, you should have said so.

766
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:02,880
I'm going to keep and protect my hospital.

767
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:07,010
That's why I've been studying more and publicizing more.

768
00:58:07,010 --> 00:58:11,030
All I received from Se Ah was an introduction to Richard.

769
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:11,940
Was that it?

770
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:16,860
You wanting to work and earn money I fully understand, also.

771
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:19,090
However,

772
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:26,530
I wish you wouldn't smile at Han Yeo Reum, <br>saying how happy you are.

773
00:58:27,590 --> 00:58:31,670
The greatest coldness and prickly attitude,

774
00:58:31,670 --> 00:58:33,650
is what I wish for you to maintain.

775
00:58:34,490 --> 00:58:36,550
I get it.

776
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:50,050
Let's get rid of this cool relationship.

777
00:58:50,050 --> 00:58:54,650
Since we both can be as petty as we'd like, it's nice.

778
00:58:54,650 --> 00:58:58,380
Ah, and one more thing.

779
00:59:00,650 --> 00:59:06,200
You, I like it when you're sleeping comfortably by my side,

780
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:08,350
but...

781
00:59:12,330 --> 00:59:14,940
I don't like just sleeping.

782
00:59:22,050 --> 00:59:24,140
Tonight,

783
00:59:28,330 --> 00:59:32,400
stay next to me and don't sleep.

784
00:59:35,290 --> 00:59:37,930
