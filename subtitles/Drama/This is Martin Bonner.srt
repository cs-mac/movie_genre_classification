This is our
introductory pamphlet.

Do you mind if I ask
how much more time you have?

7
00:00:59,126 --> 00:01:01,727
Eighteen months
and six days.

Perfect.

9
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,964
Basically the program
works in three phases.

10
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:12,137
The first phase is to develop
personal thought processes
and moral filters.

11
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:15,240
Um, the second phase,
and this is important,

12

in real-life situations.

13
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:23,916

in work programs,

15
00:01:26,387 --> 00:01:28,620
and any money you make
gets put into a bank account...

16
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:32,057
which is available to you
when you're released.

You mean I get to earn
money outside?
Yeah.

that bridge when we come to it.

25

is reentry into society,

your mentor to make sure
that you don't end up back here.

911
01:05:39,202 --> 01:05:42,637
But I'm going to school
for my master's
of library science.

912
01:05:42,639 --> 01:05:46,508
So you're a librarian.
Well, studying
to be a librarian.

913
01:05:49,078 --> 01:05:51,112
Hmm.

914
01:05:51,114 --> 01:05:54,316
I didn't know you needed
a master's for that.

915
01:05:55,351 --> 01:05:57,285
[ Chuckles ]

916
01:05:57,287 --> 01:06:00,155
I mean, you always were good
at reading, I guess.

917
01:06:00,157 --> 01:06:02,490
You read a lot
of   <i>Baby-sitter's Clu</i>books.

918
01:06:02,492 --> 01:06:06,061
Well, my-- my taste is
a little different now.

919
01:06:06,063 --> 01:06:11,399
I remember you won
a lot of personal pan pizzas
for reading stuff at school.

920
01:06:12,835 --> 01:06:15,170
I don't even like pizza.

921
01:06:20,242 --> 01:06:23,178
Can I have
a sip of your water?

922
01:06:23,846 --> 01:06:25,714
Sure.

923
01:06:25,716 --> 01:06:28,350
You sure?
Go ahead.

924
01:06:33,189 --> 01:06:34,656
Thanks.

925
01:06:37,727 --> 01:06:39,527
[ Exhales ]

926
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:44,199
Are you married?
No.

927
01:06:45,701 --> 01:06:50,238
That's why I'm getting
into the library business--

928
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:51,706
for the men.

929
01:06:51,708 --> 01:06:53,441
[ Chuckles ]

930
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:56,745
You're funny.

931
01:07:02,251 --> 01:07:05,186
This is...
very hard, you know.

932
01:07:05,188 --> 01:07:07,555
[ Sighs ]
Yeah, I know.

933
01:07:07,557 --> 01:07:11,126
I mean, I'm--
I'm trying to be positive.

934
01:07:12,328 --> 01:07:16,297
I'm glad that you're out,
and, uh, I'm glad I came, but--

935
01:07:16,299 --> 01:07:17,932
Yeah.

936
01:07:17,934 --> 01:07:20,635
There's a reason
I didn't come visit you.

937
01:07:20,637 --> 01:07:22,303
I know.

938
01:07:24,373 --> 01:07:26,041
I don't--

939
01:07:27,109 --> 01:07:29,611
I ju-- I think this
might be a mistake.

940
01:07:29,613 --> 01:07:32,113
No. Wait. A mistake? Why?

941
01:07:32,115 --> 01:07:34,149
You asked me about Astin
and some random boy...

942
01:07:34,151 --> 01:07:35,817
before you even asked
how I was doing.

943
01:07:35,819 --> 01:07:38,319
Well, wait a minute.
I'm trying here.
I think that I should go.

944
01:07:38,321 --> 01:07:40,955
- No, no, no, no, Diana.
- Sorry about that.

945
01:07:40,957 --> 01:07:43,124
Phone call
took a little longer
than I expected.

946
01:07:45,928 --> 01:07:49,030
Where are the menus?
We ordered.

947
01:07:49,032 --> 01:07:51,266
Oh, never mind.
I'll have a coffee.

948
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:55,070
What did you guys get?

949
01:07:55,871 --> 01:07:58,773
Uh, turkey melt
and a soup.

950
01:07:58,775 --> 01:08:01,376
Ah, that's a good one.

951
01:08:01,378 --> 01:08:03,078
Superbird.

952
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:04,979
What's that,
a giant chicken?

953
01:08:04,981 --> 01:08:07,682
It's a, uh,
turkey sandwich.

954
01:08:07,684 --> 01:08:09,717
Ah, all right.

955
01:08:14,890 --> 01:08:18,393
Well, um, this
is kind of funny.

956
01:08:18,395 --> 01:08:21,162
Um, I mean, it seems
so silly now
that I see you,

957
01:08:21,164 --> 01:08:25,233
but, um, I brought
a picture of you with me
in case I didn't recognize you.

958
01:08:25,235 --> 01:08:28,369
But you look exactly
the same.

959
01:08:28,371 --> 01:08:31,439
I don't really know
what I thought was gonna
happen in 12 years,

960
01:08:31,441 --> 01:08:36,044
but I guess you don't
really change that much
when you're older.

961
01:08:36,046 --> 01:08:38,913
[ Chuckles ]
I wish.

962
01:08:38,915 --> 01:08:41,082
[ Chuckles ]

963
01:08:41,084 --> 01:08:43,184
Which picture?

964
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:49,124
Oh.

965
01:08:50,326 --> 01:08:52,694
Yeah, I don't remember
where this was taken.

966
01:08:52,696 --> 01:08:55,463
Your mother took it though.
Yeah, I know.

967
01:08:57,199 --> 01:08:59,234
The glory days.

968
01:08:59,236 --> 01:09:00,869
Hmm.

969
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:05,974
Well, you could have chose
a worse picture.

970
01:09:05,976 --> 01:09:08,877
You mean like...
this one?

971
01:09:11,514 --> 01:09:13,248
- Let me look at it.
- [ Travis ] No, no.

972
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:15,450
No, come on.
Come on. Come on.

973
01:09:17,853 --> 01:09:21,756
[ Chuckles ]
Very sharp.

974
01:09:22,525 --> 01:09:24,492
Burn this one.

975
01:09:27,329 --> 01:09:29,764
I don't have many pictures
of when I was a teenager.

976
01:09:29,766 --> 01:09:31,232
How come?
I don't know.

977
01:09:31,234 --> 01:09:33,101
We didn't own a camera.

978
01:09:33,103 --> 01:09:37,705
Um, but there--
Someone must have brought it
around because there were a few.

979
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:41,543
Did you grow up
in Australia?
Yeah, yeah. In Perth.

980
01:09:41,545 --> 01:09:43,111
Oh, really?
Yep.

981
01:09:43,113 --> 01:09:47,015
I've always wanted
to go to Australia.
Me too.

982
01:09:47,017 --> 01:09:48,816
Well, you should go.

983
01:09:48,818 --> 01:09:51,085
Did you need
a menu, hon?

984
01:09:51,087 --> 01:09:53,955
Uh, no, thank you.
Um, just a coffee.

985
01:09:53,957 --> 01:09:55,790
[ Woman ]
Milk and sugar?
Yep.

986
01:09:55,792 --> 01:09:57,792
[ Woman ] Um, your food
will be out in just a second.
Thanks.

987
01:09:57,794 --> 01:09:59,460
Mm-hmm.

988
01:10:02,798 --> 01:10:07,035
So this Kiwi walks into a bar
with a pig under his arm,

989
01:10:07,037 --> 01:10:11,706
and the barman
looks at him and he says,
"Where'd you get it?"

990
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:14,275
And the pig says,
"I won him in a raffle."

991
01:10:19,014 --> 01:10:21,916
Good one.
It's a bit lame though.

992
01:10:21,918 --> 01:10:24,219
You can use it
if you want to.

993
01:10:27,256 --> 01:10:29,591
[ Woman ]
Whenever you guys are ready.
Can I take these?

994
01:10:29,593 --> 01:10:31,459
Yes.
Thank you.

995
01:10:32,995 --> 01:10:35,063
- [ Travis ] No, no, no, no,
don't do that.
- Oh, it's fine.

996
01:10:35,065 --> 01:10:36,631
Yeah, please let me get it.

997
01:10:36,633 --> 01:10:38,633
Okay.

998
01:10:38,635 --> 01:10:40,835
Let me give you some money
for my coffee.
No, no, no.

999
01:10:40,837 --> 01:10:42,537
I've got it.

1000
01:10:42,539 --> 01:10:45,707
Okay. It's my treat
next time.

1001
01:10:49,411 --> 01:10:52,347
I mean,
the day after Christmas
I always work, you know,

1002
01:10:52,349 --> 01:10:55,750
because it's
the big sales and stuff.
Right.

1003
01:10:55,752 --> 01:11:00,121
If you need, like,
a DVD player, let me know.

1004
01:11:00,123 --> 01:11:03,091
Well, Diana,

1005
01:11:03,093 --> 01:11:05,560
it has been a pleasure
to meet you.
Nice to meet you too.

1006
01:11:05,562 --> 01:11:07,595
All right,
have a nice afternoon.
Have a good trip back.

1007
01:11:07,597 --> 01:11:10,198
Thanks.
Yeah, and I hope
to see you again soon.

1008
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:12,934
- Okay.
- All right. Travis.

1009
01:11:12,936 --> 01:11:16,504
Could you come
by the office this afternoon
when Diana is on the road?

1010
01:11:16,506 --> 01:11:18,072
Sure.

1011
01:11:18,074 --> 01:11:20,642
I need you to do me a favor.
Okay.

1012
01:11:20,644 --> 01:11:22,677
Okay. Duty calls.

1013
01:11:23,379 --> 01:11:24,879
Bye.

1014
01:11:26,849 --> 01:11:28,816
He's nice.
Yeah.

1015
01:11:28,818 --> 01:11:30,385
[ Engine Starts ]

1016
01:11:30,387 --> 01:11:33,721
It's cool what those people
are doing for you.

1017
01:11:33,723 --> 01:11:35,890
Yeah, it's cool.

1018
01:11:40,329 --> 01:11:42,597
I have to look
at an apartment later.

1019
01:11:42,599 --> 01:11:45,800
Do you wanna come,
or should I do it tomorrow?

1020
01:11:45,802 --> 01:11:48,703
Actually, I-- I think
I'm gonna head back to the bus.

1021
01:11:48,705 --> 01:11:52,407
What?
I got my return ticket
for the 3:00.

1022
01:11:52,409 --> 01:11:55,043
I thought you were
gonna take the 6:00.

1023
01:11:55,045 --> 01:11:56,811
I thought I might,
but I didn't.

1024
01:11:56,813 --> 01:12:00,148
I just-- I--
I didn't know what to expect.

1025
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:01,783
Can you change it?

1026
01:12:01,785 --> 01:12:03,651
I don't know.

1027
01:12:05,054 --> 01:12:07,221
Look, this was nice,

1028
01:12:07,223 --> 01:12:11,092
but let's just
take it slow, okay?

1029
01:12:11,094 --> 01:12:14,329
I mean, I know you
probably wanna make up
for lost time or whatever,

1030
01:12:14,331 --> 01:12:16,931
but I can't just
do it like that.

1031
01:12:16,933 --> 01:12:19,000
This is how I need to do it.

1032
01:12:21,937 --> 01:12:23,604
Okay.

1033
01:12:24,106 --> 01:12:25,773
Okay.

1034
01:12:27,609 --> 01:12:29,844
Can I give you money
for the bus?
No, no, no, you keep it.

1035
01:12:29,846 --> 01:12:31,479
I'm-- I'm all right.

1036
01:12:34,983 --> 01:12:36,684
So--

1037
01:12:52,768 --> 01:12:55,670
Okay, well,
let me know when you
get home safe, okay?

1038
01:12:55,672 --> 01:12:57,505
Okay. I will.

1039
01:12:57,940 --> 01:12:59,607
So--

1040
01:13:00,008 --> 01:13:01,709
Bye.

1041
01:13:42,117 --> 01:13:44,519
So there's
a closet over here.

1042
01:13:50,626 --> 01:13:54,028
Yeah. Over here
is a bathroom.

1043
01:14:26,228 --> 01:14:28,596
Listen, I prob--
Forget it.

1044
01:14:30,766 --> 01:14:32,934
Well, thanks
for coming back.

1045
01:14:36,505 --> 01:14:39,273
Hello, Jeff.
Hey, Mr. Bonner.

1046
01:14:39,275 --> 01:14:41,275
Jeff, this is
Travis Holloway.

1047
01:14:41,277 --> 01:14:42,810
Travis.
Hi.

1048
01:14:42,812 --> 01:14:45,179
This is Jeff.
He's our video guy.
Hi.

1049
01:14:45,181 --> 01:14:46,981
So, are you guys all set?

1050
01:14:46,983 --> 01:14:49,717
Yep. Just give him
a quick rundown on what
you're gonna ask, that's all.

1051
01:14:49,719 --> 01:14:51,986
Sure.
Well, you'll sit here,

1052
01:14:51,988 --> 01:14:54,856
and I'll just ask you
about how things have
been going in the program.

1053
01:14:54,858 --> 01:14:57,425
It's for prospective
volunteers and donors,

1054
01:14:57,427 --> 01:15:00,428
so hopefully
you can keep it
positive but truthful.

1055
01:15:00,430 --> 01:15:04,398
And, um, just answer
with experiences
you've had...

1056
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:05,933
now that you've
been released.

1057
01:15:05,935 --> 01:15:08,536
And you're
gonna be filming this?
Oh, yeah.

1058
01:15:08,538 --> 01:15:11,072
I'm not very comfortable
on camera.

1059
01:15:11,074 --> 01:15:14,141
[ Jeff ]
Oh, that's fine. That's fine.
You don't have to be Cary Grant.

1060
01:15:14,143 --> 01:15:16,477
Just answer
however you feel.

1061
01:15:16,479 --> 01:15:19,647
Okay.
All right, so--

1062
01:15:19,649 --> 01:15:23,217
