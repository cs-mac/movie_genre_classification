1
00:00:41,014 --> 00:00:47,020
Somewhere, a while ago already

2
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:09,542
Sir?

3
00:01:10,377 --> 00:01:12,962
Excuse me, sir?
Your seatbelt, please.

4
00:01:13,004 --> 00:01:14,089
Oh, sorry.

5
00:01:21,805 --> 00:01:23,556
God, I'm so sorry.

6
00:01:27,143 --> 00:01:31,314
<i>There I was, after 10 years-
well, 12, to be precise...</i>

7
00:01:33,233 --> 00:01:37,028
<i>So, after twelve years of absence</i>

8
00:01:37,487 --> 00:01:41,074
<i>and in spite of my fear,
I was going to visit them.</i>

9
00:01:43,284 --> 00:01:47,122
<i>In life there are
a number of motivations</i>

10
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:52,168
<i>that are no one's business,
that force you to leave,</i>

11
00:01:52,836 --> 00:01:54,796
<i>without looking back.</i>

12
00:01:55,338 --> 00:01:59,175
<i>And there are
just as many motivations</i>

13
00:01:59,217 --> 00:02:01,219
<i>that force you to return.</i>

14
00:02:03,263 --> 00:02:06,891
<i>So after all those years,</i>

15
00:02:07,434 --> 00:02:10,103
<i>I decided to retrace my steps.</i>

16
00:02:13,398 --> 00:02:15,191
<i>Take the journey...</i>

17
00:02:17,736 --> 00:02:19,904
<i>to announce my death.</i>

18
00:02:22,907 --> 00:02:24,826
<i>Announce it in person,</i>

19
00:02:24,868 --> 00:02:28,663
<i>and try to give the others,
and myself, one last time,</i>

20
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,584
<i>the illusion that I am,</i>

21
00:02:34,794 --> 00:02:36,755
<i>until its very end,</i>

22
00:02:42,052 --> 00:02:43,762
<i>the master of my life.</i>

23
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:48,850
<i>Let's see how that goes.</i>

24
00:03:24,386 --> 00:03:32,727
IT'S ONLY THE END OF THE WORLD

25
00:05:28,468 --> 00:05:30,971
Mom! Tony! He's here!

26
00:05:31,012 --> 00:05:34,265
- That twat took a cab!
- Shit, I'm not ready.

27
00:05:34,307 --> 00:05:36,101
You could've done that before!

28
00:05:36,142 --> 00:05:38,061
Before! That's rich!

29
00:05:38,103 --> 00:05:41,481
I was mixing baba ganoush
while you primped.

30
00:05:41,523 --> 00:05:44,484
You've been spiffing up for hours!

31
00:05:44,526 --> 00:05:48,196
Suzanne, stop! A mother
can smarten up for her son.

32
00:05:48,238 --> 00:05:51,366
Louis loves fashion and color.
All gay men do!

33
00:05:51,408 --> 00:05:54,619
- That explains the tranny look!
- Tranny? Thanks.

34
00:05:54,661 --> 00:05:58,415
I don't want to fight,
he's almost here!

35
00:05:58,456 --> 00:06:03,503
You always want the last word!
Think I'll give it to you?

36
00:06:03,545 --> 00:06:04,838
I don't care.

37
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:07,215
Exactly! "I don't care,
I don't care."

38
00:06:07,257 --> 00:06:08,675
That's Missy's motto!

39
00:07:03,521 --> 00:07:06,775
The cab must've cost you an arm.

40
00:07:06,816 --> 00:07:08,777
I said I'd pick you up.

41
00:07:08,818 --> 00:07:12,739
Louis! Love the hair!
I can't see, but looks nice.

42
00:07:12,781 --> 00:07:15,575
The cab must've cost you
a pretty penny!

43
00:07:15,617 --> 00:07:17,118
I just said that!

44
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:20,622
Louis, you don't know Catherine.

45
00:07:20,664 --> 00:07:21,706
No.

46
00:07:21,748 --> 00:07:24,000
Catherine, Louis.
Louis, Catherine.

47
00:07:24,376 --> 00:07:26,294
- Hi, Catherine.
- Hi.

48
00:07:27,045 --> 00:07:30,131
You must be crazy hot. Gimme that.

49
00:07:30,173 --> 00:07:31,883
Let him come inside!

50
00:07:31,925 --> 00:07:33,259
She's happy.

51
00:07:33,301 --> 00:07:35,762
- She's wagging like a poodle.
- Antoine!

52
00:07:35,804 --> 00:07:38,765
I'm coming, Louis!
Stupid nail polish.

53
00:07:38,807 --> 00:07:40,767
Hair dryer won't dry!

54
00:07:40,809 --> 00:07:42,644
I'm delighted, Catherine.

55
00:07:42,686 --> 00:07:45,480
Of course... I mean, me course...

56
00:07:45,522 --> 00:07:46,940
Uh, me too.

57
00:07:48,316 --> 00:07:50,944
I'm delighted too. Oh God!

58
00:07:51,945 --> 00:07:55,073
You shake hands?
Like you're presidents?

59
00:07:55,115 --> 00:07:56,241
Or strangers?

60
00:07:56,282 --> 00:07:57,826
They are strangers!

61
00:07:59,119 --> 00:08:00,704
She didn't know.

62
00:08:00,745 --> 00:08:02,622
Give her a kiss, Louis.

63
00:08:03,289 --> 00:08:05,125
Suzanne's right, kisses.

64
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:06,918
Charmed.

65
00:08:08,545 --> 00:08:10,797
Charmed? Why the heck "charmed"?

66
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:12,090
They've never met!

67
00:08:12,132 --> 00:08:13,967
They've never met, Mom!

68
00:08:14,801 --> 00:08:16,636
Stop screaming, crazy!

69
00:08:16,678 --> 00:08:18,930
Never?

70
00:08:18,972 --> 00:08:21,099
Why no, he wasn't there.

71
00:08:23,643 --> 00:08:25,312
You're batshit crazy!

72
00:08:27,355 --> 00:08:30,358
I forgot, that's all.
I didn't realize...

73
00:08:30,775 --> 00:08:34,946
Well, darn it!
We sure do live in strange times.

74
00:08:35,238 --> 00:08:36,364
Sweetie!

75
00:08:36,406 --> 00:08:37,407
No.

76
00:08:37,824 --> 00:08:38,825
Louis.

77
00:08:39,284 --> 00:08:40,744
You hate "sweetie."

78
00:08:42,787 --> 00:08:46,499
- You knew they'd never met.
- He wasn't at the wedding.

79
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:49,085
He couldn't make it.
Remember, Martine?

80
00:08:49,127 --> 00:08:53,548
I know, darling,
but it slipped my mind.

81
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:56,468
Since then
there's been no occasion...

82
00:08:56,509 --> 00:08:58,845
Catherine, she just
wants attention.

83
00:08:58,887 --> 00:09:01,056
Shut it, will you.

84
00:09:01,097 --> 00:09:02,849
A bummer about the cab.

85
00:09:02,891 --> 00:09:06,936
I'd have picked you up.
I got a car now.

86
00:09:06,978 --> 00:09:09,314
I said he'd do that, Mom.

87
00:09:09,731 --> 00:09:12,192
- How was the journey?
- I told you last night.

88
00:09:12,233 --> 00:09:13,276
I don't remember.

89
00:09:13,318 --> 00:09:16,279
- But I told you.
- Suzanne, who gives a shit?

90
00:09:16,321 --> 00:09:17,364
Antoine!

91
00:09:17,405 --> 00:09:18,865
So you travelled safe?

92
00:09:18,907 --> 00:09:22,494
Yes. But I wouldn't
call it travelling.

93
00:09:25,705 --> 00:09:27,082
Well, then...

94
00:09:27,874 --> 00:09:29,125
Let's.

95
00:09:39,719 --> 00:09:42,472
See, Catherine, like I said.
That's Louis.

96
00:09:42,514 --> 00:09:45,225
Kisses only Mom,
not even his brother...

97
00:09:45,266 --> 00:09:46,768
Drop it, will you?

98
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:48,812
Am I talking to you? Fuck off!

99
00:09:48,853 --> 00:09:50,230
Antoine!

100
00:09:52,983 --> 00:09:56,319
They're with their
other grandmother. My mom.

101
00:09:56,361 --> 00:09:57,946
Of course.

102
00:09:58,947 --> 00:10:02,409
We had no way of knowing.
It was so...

103
00:10:02,993 --> 00:10:07,747
She was expecting them.
She'd have made a scene...

104
00:10:08,081 --> 00:10:10,875
But they'd have loved to see you.

105
00:10:11,126 --> 00:10:13,086
And me too. I mean...

106
00:10:13,503 --> 00:10:16,798
Antoine and I would've
liked you to meet them.

107
00:10:17,465 --> 00:10:20,635
That's our oldest, she's 8.

108
00:10:20,677 --> 00:10:23,638
Everyone says she looks
just like Antoine.

109
00:10:24,973 --> 00:10:27,600
His spitting image.

110
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:32,731
But we say that of all children,
right? True or not.

111
00:10:33,148 --> 00:10:34,482
- We do.
- Don't we?

112
00:10:35,358 --> 00:10:38,653
Alrighty! Appetizers
in the living room, I guess?

113
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,283
Cold cuts from Célestin's
and chorizo for Louis...

114
00:10:43,325 --> 00:10:45,368
- Still a fan?
- Yes.

115
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,454
She's got her dad's temper!

116
00:10:47,495 --> 00:10:49,706
A stubborn little devil!
An Antoinette.

117
00:10:50,415 --> 00:10:51,624
Lucky us.

118
00:10:52,334 --> 00:10:55,587
Louis, you had send me a note...

119
00:10:55,628 --> 00:11:00,175
<i>sent! - sorry, sent me a note,
</i>and flowers.

120
00:11:02,218 --> 00:11:04,179
God were they pretty!

121
00:11:04,638 --> 00:11:09,017
I was really, really happy!
I sure liked them.

122
00:11:09,059 --> 00:11:11,019
And I, well...

123
00:11:11,061 --> 00:11:15,649
Antoine and I had sent you
a photo of her, and...

124
00:11:16,316 --> 00:11:21,696
It was ridiculous. Well...
She fit in Antoine's hand.

125
00:11:21,738 --> 00:11:24,658
She was so tiny.
A teeny-tiny baby.

126
00:11:24,699 --> 00:11:26,201
Remember, Antoine?

127
00:11:26,242 --> 00:11:30,205
No. I love forgetting the most
important things in my life.

128
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,755
Yeah.

129
00:11:39,714 --> 00:11:42,050
Actually, on this photo,

130
00:11:42,884 --> 00:11:45,011
the resemblance to Antoine...

131
00:11:45,387 --> 00:11:46,388
Zero.

132
00:11:46,846 --> 00:11:50,266
Zero, really.
Big, big fat zero.

133
00:11:51,643 --> 00:11:54,813
But we don't look like anyone
at that age.

134
00:11:55,563 --> 00:11:57,107
Anyway, she's grown up.

135
00:11:57,148 --> 00:12:01,152
Don't you think
you're boring him with that?

136
00:12:02,153 --> 00:12:03,154
You think so?

137
00:12:03,571 --> 00:12:04,572
Not at all!

138
00:12:05,115 --> 00:12:06,116
Why?

139
00:12:06,449 --> 00:12:07,409
Catherine, no.

140
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:08,451
No but...

141
00:12:09,536 --> 00:12:12,455
That's my thing.
I bore everybody with my kids.

142
00:12:12,872 --> 00:12:17,168
You think kids interest people.
But guess what? Nope.

143
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:19,045
No, Catherine.

144
00:12:20,255 --> 00:12:23,425
I don't know why he said that.
Why'd you say that?

145
00:12:23,967 --> 00:12:26,344
It's mean. Well, unpleasant.

146
00:12:26,386 --> 00:12:29,264
Yeah, Antoine. Be fucking decent.

147
00:12:29,306 --> 00:12:32,892
Like that dress?
"Nightmare in Tokyo"?

148
00:12:32,934 --> 00:12:36,438
Beats that jacket
and the "clueless dick" kit.

149
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:40,025
What about that paint on your face?

150
00:12:40,066 --> 00:12:42,027
- Fuck you!
- Enough, kids!

151
00:12:42,068 --> 00:12:43,445
He started it.

152
00:13:06,593 --> 00:13:07,594
Louis?

153
00:14:17,914 --> 00:14:19,749
I'm not bored, Catherine.

154
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:22,335
I love hearing about your kids.

155
00:14:23,003 --> 00:14:24,045
I'm glad.

156
00:14:24,087 --> 00:14:25,171
And, um...

157
00:14:25,714 --> 00:14:29,134
Don't you have a boy
who has my name?

158
00:14:31,261 --> 00:14:32,762
Yes.

159
00:14:34,097 --> 00:14:35,682
Yes. Sorry, yes.

160
00:14:35,724 --> 00:14:38,852
I'm happy. I'm touched.

161
00:14:39,185 --> 00:14:41,187
I mean, it touched me.

162
00:14:41,688 --> 00:14:43,523
Six years old now...

163
00:14:43,565 --> 00:14:47,360
Six. They're two years apart, and...

164
00:14:48,236 --> 00:14:49,612
I don't know

165
00:14:49,863 --> 00:14:51,906
if I should keep going or...

166
00:14:51,948 --> 00:14:54,576
Hey whoa, whoa! Don't blame me.

167
00:14:54,993 --> 00:14:56,619
If you want to talk, talk.

168
00:14:56,661 --> 00:15:00,415
Don't make me sound
like a bully muzzling you.

169
00:15:00,915 --> 00:15:02,208
You're nuts, Antoine.

170
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,293
You're nuts.

171
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:05,503
Tell him, please.
He's all ears.

172
00:15:05,962 --> 00:15:08,048
Go ahead.

173
00:15:08,089 --> 00:15:11,176
He loves it. Our children,
the children of the world...

174
00:15:11,593 --> 00:15:16,306
He's so fond of this topic!
The evolution of our offspring.

175
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:18,516
His favorite conversation.
So tell him!

176
00:15:18,558 --> 00:15:20,268
Chill the fuck out, Tony.

177
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:24,731
Oh God, okay, sorry.
I shouldn't have.

178
00:15:24,773 --> 00:15:26,608
I didn't mean to...

179
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:29,736
I'm sorry, darling. Go on.

180
00:15:29,778 --> 00:15:32,238
I'm embarrassed. Sorry, Catherine.

181
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:36,034
No offense, Antoine...
You're making me uncomfortable.

182
00:15:36,076 --> 00:15:38,328
I'm so sorry, really!

183
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:41,665
Big Bad Antoine
spoiled the lovely day!

184
00:15:41,706 --> 00:15:43,750
Shut up and let her talk!

185
00:15:43,792 --> 00:15:45,669
Go on, Catherine.
Ignore him.

186
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,212
Yeah, ignore me!

187
00:15:47,253 --> 00:15:50,632
There's my dip
and then jalapegno... <i>Peno ?</i>

188
00:15:50,674 --> 00:15:51,716
Peño.

189
00:15:51,758 --> 00:15:54,886
Anyhow, spicy.
And fry sauce of course.

190
00:15:54,928 --> 00:15:56,471
Catherine, do tell.

191
00:15:59,891 --> 00:16:00,892
No but...

192
00:16:02,435 --> 00:16:03,937
That's it, he just...

193
00:16:05,772 --> 00:16:09,025
He has your name, sir.
I mean, Louis.

194
00:16:09,859 --> 00:16:10,986
And, um...

195
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:17,117
What I think is interesting
is that, first and foremost,

196
00:16:17,158 --> 00:16:20,370
he has, if we go back,

197
00:16:21,162 --> 00:16:25,208
your father's name,
and so, needless to say...

198
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,043
Here we go, French kings...

199
00:16:27,085 --> 00:16:30,630
Look, Antoine,
I'll just shut up, alright?

200
00:16:31,089 --> 00:16:33,133
And you tell the story.

201
00:16:33,174 --> 00:16:34,968
Or no one does, and...

202
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:37,846
We just sit here choking
on fry sauce!

203
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,474
Choking on my dip,
little did I know.

204
00:16:41,516 --> 00:16:44,561
- Martine, I meant...
- Express yourself, doll.

205
00:16:44,602 --> 00:16:47,147
I was kidding, sweetheart.

206
00:16:49,107 --> 00:16:51,526
Tell Louis the story. Tell him.

207
00:16:55,363 --> 00:16:57,991
He's got your father's name.

208
00:16:59,701 --> 00:17:03,163
And I...
Well, <i>we thought it'd be great.</i>

209
00:17:04,414 --> 00:17:07,375
- In my family...
<i>- Oh, it's you, hon!</i>

210
00:17:07,792 --> 00:17:10,128
Well, there's a tradition

211
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:13,631
by which the parents' first name,

212
00:17:13,673 --> 00:17:17,218
or the first name
of the baby's grandfather...

213
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,679
Basically, the first son's name

214
00:17:20,597 --> 00:17:23,642
and the grandfather's name are...

215
00:17:24,392 --> 00:17:25,560
identical.

216
00:17:25,894 --> 00:17:30,732
I told Lori you're here. She said,
"Must be a cold day in hell!"

217
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:33,360
Dumb as ever, that one.

218
00:17:33,985 --> 00:17:36,071
So, Antoine's the eldest,

219
00:17:36,112 --> 00:17:40,075
but Antoine, to me, was a no.

220
00:17:40,575 --> 00:17:42,285
And Louis was a yes.

221
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:47,332
Antoine didn't want an Antoine,
said it'd be bad luck.

222
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:50,502
Since you people don't have kids,

223
00:17:50,543 --> 00:17:53,713
we weren't depriving you
of anything.

224
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:00,011
But...

225
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:06,559
I mean, we say that,
but of course you can...

226
00:18:06,977 --> 00:18:10,730
have children.
Everything's possible nowadays.

227
00:18:11,815 --> 00:18:15,652
You'll have some, I'm sure.
You're still young and...

228
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:17,487
Would you have named him Louis?

229
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:20,281
You still can. Right, Antoine?

230
00:18:20,323 --> 00:18:21,366
Mm-hmm.

231
00:18:21,408 --> 00:18:23,159
Okay, Catherine, I need a hand.

232
00:18:23,201 --> 00:18:25,829
- Are you hungry?
- Getting there.

233
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:28,289
Me too.
Louis, wanna see my room?

234
00:18:28,331 --> 00:18:29,374
Sure.

235
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:32,585
- What do I do? Jerk off?
<i>- Come hold my pots!</i>

236
00:18:33,753 --> 00:18:34,879
Antoine?

237
00:18:35,422 --> 00:18:37,173
- Antoine, d'you hear?
- Yeah!

238
00:18:37,507 --> 00:18:38,842
Jesus Christ!

239
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,470
I hardly remember you.

240
00:18:42,929 --> 00:18:45,515
I was young and...

241
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:49,144
I have zero memories.

242
00:18:49,477 --> 00:18:51,771
Only what people told me.

243
00:18:52,105 --> 00:18:53,857
Anyway, I'm just...

244
00:18:55,275 --> 00:18:56,526
Just rambling.

245
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,739
It sucks that you left.

246
00:19:03,992 --> 00:19:05,160
Sucks, uh...

247
00:19:05,869 --> 00:19:07,579
for me, for her,

248
00:19:08,621 --> 00:19:10,123
Antoine.

249
00:19:11,249 --> 00:19:13,126
For you too, right?

250
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:16,921
You don't have to answer.

251
00:19:16,963 --> 00:19:19,382
But maybe you regret it too?

252
00:19:21,092 --> 00:19:22,969
Maybe you needed us?

253
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,765
I... I'm sorry.

254
00:19:28,141 --> 00:19:29,893
That's why I'm here.

255
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:33,104
Partly.

256
00:19:33,813 --> 00:19:37,942
It's funny, 'cause before
I got your postcard or letter,

257
00:19:37,984 --> 00:19:41,696
I'd say to myself that...
we were due, y'know.

258
00:19:42,739 --> 00:19:44,407
That the time was right.

259
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:46,618
- Yeah.
- And...

260
00:19:47,285 --> 00:19:48,286
whenever...

261
00:19:49,412 --> 00:19:51,164
I'm the one who gets the mail.

262
00:19:52,874 --> 00:19:56,586
<i>And whenever I see a postcard
in the pile,</i>

263
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:59,464
<i>I try to put it picture side up.</i>

264
00:19:59,506 --> 00:20:04,594
<i>That way, I have something
to turn over. To discover.</i>

265
00:20:05,303 --> 00:20:07,472
Something I'm hoping for.

266
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:14,020
It's funny 'cause...
we're all following you,

267
00:20:14,062 --> 00:20:17,065
reading articles,
doing all that stuff and...

268
00:20:17,107 --> 00:20:20,193
You know, you can't not know that...

269
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:23,071
we feel, I mean...

270
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:28,326
We all feel a sort of...

271
00:20:29,911 --> 00:20:30,912
admiration.

272
00:20:31,788 --> 00:20:32,789
For you.

273
00:20:33,373 --> 00:20:34,749
Sounds silly, but...

274
00:20:35,917 --> 00:20:36,918
It's a gift.

275
00:20:37,168 --> 00:20:38,670
You have a gift.

276
00:20:41,756 --> 00:20:42,757
You're laughing?

277
00:20:43,466 --> 00:20:44,509
Yeah, I...

278
00:20:44,551 --> 00:20:48,179
Why? It's a gift, that's it.

279
00:20:48,221 --> 00:20:49,639
It's not funny.

280
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,683
I'm complimenting you.

281
00:20:52,183 --> 00:20:53,184
You got a gift.

282
00:20:53,768 --> 00:20:54,936
You're lucky.

283
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:59,941
Yeah 'cause...
You don't really use it with us.

284
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:02,527
It's for others.

285
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:05,030
Or maybe for no one.

286
00:21:07,073 --> 00:21:09,034
I don't know you.

287
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:13,538
I'm just saying that.
I'm not judging.

288
00:21:14,122 --> 00:21:17,042
Those are facts.
I'm thinking out loud.

289
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:22,047
Fucking kills me. I'm so itchy.

290
00:21:22,088 --> 00:21:23,131
What?

291
00:21:23,173 --> 00:21:24,799
I dunno, the makeup.

292
00:21:28,595 --> 00:21:31,014
I never use it, so it itches.

293
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:34,601
I just wanted... I dunno.
Know what I mean?

294
00:21:34,643 --> 00:21:37,812
And Mom's makeup is shit.

295
00:21:37,854 --> 00:21:40,774
It's red and gross,
so I bought this stuff.

296
00:21:45,153 --> 00:21:47,030
Don't you wanna sit down?

297
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:50,158
It's cozy.

298
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:52,077
I'm good.

299
00:22:11,638 --> 00:22:12,764
Those are all mine.

300
00:22:13,723 --> 00:22:17,102
<i>We just call them
your "elliptic bits."</i>

301
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:19,813
<i>Maybe "elliptic" is wrong.</i>

302
00:22:20,146 --> 00:22:21,147
<i>No.</i>

303
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:23,441
<i>I mean...</i>

304
00:22:23,483 --> 00:22:24,859
<i>I get it.</i>

305
00:22:24,901 --> 00:22:26,903
<i>We each have our collection.</i>

306
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:28,863
<i>Antoine.</i>

307
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:31,282
<i>Mom, obviously.</i>

308
00:22:31,324 --> 00:22:32,534
<i>And she's right.</i>

309
00:22:32,575 --> 00:22:36,329
<i>You've never forgotten the...
our birthdays.</i>

310
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:39,916
<i>The important days of our lives.</i>

311
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:43,253
<i>Always a postcard, always something.</i>

312
00:22:44,087 --> 00:22:46,256
Anyway, I dunno.

313
00:22:46,548 --> 00:22:49,718
I've stopped complaining 'cause...

314
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:54,472
She lectures us when we dare
say you're... not around.

315
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:59,060
"He does what he has to do.
He always has."

316
00:22:59,602 --> 00:23:00,854
She says that?

317
00:23:00,895 --> 00:23:03,857
Of course. I didn't make it up.

318
00:23:03,898 --> 00:23:07,819
But don't worry, I'm an adult, I...

319
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,821
No problem.

320
00:23:09,863 --> 00:23:11,031
No problemo.

321
00:23:11,406 --> 00:23:12,907
No!

322
00:23:14,034 --> 00:23:15,910
No problemo.

323
00:23:15,952 --> 00:23:17,996
Dunno why I said that.

324
00:23:18,621 --> 00:23:20,165
I hate that.

325
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:21,875
It's not me.

326
00:23:21,916 --> 00:23:24,878
I hate that expression,
it's ridiculous.

327
00:23:25,128 --> 00:23:26,713
So what is "you"?

328
00:23:26,755 --> 00:23:30,216
It's weird how you always
send postcards,

329
00:23:30,258 --> 00:23:32,302
as if you're on vacation,

330
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:34,888
and mailmen can see what you write.

331
00:23:35,221 --> 00:23:36,640
I dunno.

332
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:41,686
Do you let everyone see
the important things you write?

333
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:45,315
Well, what you write isn't...

334
00:23:46,775 --> 00:23:48,193
Okay, this is just...

335
00:23:48,443 --> 00:23:50,278
Pathetic. I'm pathetic.

336
00:23:51,571 --> 00:23:53,365
Everyone says so.

337
00:23:53,948 --> 00:23:55,450
Sorry.

338
00:23:56,868 --> 00:23:58,578
I didn't mean to...

339
00:23:59,496 --> 00:24:01,665
I'm sorry, Suzanne.

340
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:05,669
No, it's me.

341
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:08,797
I'm sorry.

342
00:24:14,886 --> 00:24:17,931
Friggin' heat wave
is driving us crazy.

343
00:24:18,348 --> 00:24:20,100
And here it's worse.

344
00:24:20,433 --> 00:24:22,352
Everything's worse here.

345
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:26,356
I wanted to leave but, I dunno...

346
00:24:27,107 --> 00:24:28,400
I'm good here.

347
00:24:28,441 --> 00:24:30,360
Got the basement,

348
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:32,779
my room, the storage.

349
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:35,407
That's the room behind you.

350
00:24:36,199 --> 00:24:39,869
Shit from the old house.
Yours, mostly.

351
00:24:39,911 --> 00:24:43,248
Mom's gonna ask
if you want any of it.

352
00:24:44,124 --> 00:24:45,417
Bet you don't.

353
00:25:19,242 --> 00:25:20,660
Louis?

354
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:22,746
Are you listening?

355
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:25,332
Yeah, stuff you bought yourself.

356
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:28,084
Did you buy the car?

357
00:25:29,419 --> 00:25:31,129
Antoine's old one.

358
00:25:32,589 --> 00:25:34,215
<i>Mom bought it.</i>

359
00:25:34,632 --> 00:25:36,343
<i>Mom doesn't drive.</i>

360
00:25:36,676 --> 00:25:40,430
<i>Mm-hmm, so guess
who's her slave driver?</i>

361
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:44,476
<i>But I can drive downtown,
see the girls.</i>

362
00:25:46,102 --> 00:25:47,979
<i>And I drive Mom for errands.</i>

363
00:25:48,438 --> 00:25:50,398
<i>We don't depend on anyone.</i>

364
00:25:51,775 --> 00:25:53,485
<i>We bother no one.</i>

365
00:25:54,361 --> 00:25:57,906
<i>And I like those little moments
with Mom.</i>

366
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:01,826
<i>She's fun.</i>

367
00:26:02,619 --> 00:26:04,496
<i>She's nuts, though.</i>

368
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:07,957
Anyway...

369
00:26:10,543 --> 00:26:12,128
No.

370
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:16,174
I knew you'd say no.
Smoking isn't very you.

371
00:26:17,634 --> 00:26:19,344
Are you completely high?

372
00:26:19,761 --> 00:26:21,221
No.

373
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,390
I hardly feel it anymore.

374
00:26:25,266 --> 00:26:27,852
In fact, it might do me good.

375
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:31,022
- I don't usually smoke, but...
- So?

376
00:26:31,064 --> 00:26:32,065
Why you here?

377
00:26:33,233 --> 00:26:35,527
Got someone to introduce?

378
00:26:35,944 --> 00:26:37,696
Are you pregnant?

379
00:26:39,572 --> 00:26:41,783
For you. For, uh...

380
00:26:43,994 --> 00:26:45,704
I don't know.

381
00:26:46,746 --> 00:26:49,249
I'd love to see our old house.

382
00:26:49,624 --> 00:26:50,917
Why?

383
00:26:50,959 --> 00:26:54,004
Why do you wanna go back
to that ugly place?

384
00:26:55,797 --> 00:26:58,174
I don't know. Out of nostalgia.

385
00:26:58,591 --> 00:27:00,552
Is it for a play?

386
00:27:00,593 --> 00:27:02,178
No.

387
00:27:04,431 --> 00:27:05,932
No.

388
00:27:06,308 --> 00:27:09,352
<i>Suzanne! Louis! Are you coming?</i>

389
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:10,645
Stop screaming!

390
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:13,106
<i>Well, get the hell up!</i>

391
00:27:14,649 --> 00:27:17,152
Check out the storage room
if you want.

392
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:19,612
And your old stuff.

393
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:22,073
Out of nostalgia.

394
00:27:28,455 --> 00:27:30,498
Reminds me of our Sundays!

395
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,459
- Ugh! Please!
- What?

396
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,712
She knows about Sundays.
Be honest, say it!

397
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:37,339
Let her talk, Antoine.

398
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:40,884
He's embarrassed.
His Majesty longed for adventure!

399
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:43,762
That's why he went
to China after college.

400
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:47,140
- You went to China?
- So?

401
00:27:47,724 --> 00:27:51,394
So, I was working,
my husband was working...

402
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:53,480
Bottom line, we both worked.

403
00:27:53,521 --> 00:27:55,023
There you are, sweetie!

404
00:27:55,065 --> 00:27:57,400
It's story time. Lucky you!

405
00:27:57,817 --> 00:27:59,819
- Our Sundays?
- Ha! See?

406
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:01,738
Even Louis, Mom!

407
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,323
Let us be, Antoine.

408
00:28:03,365 --> 00:28:04,741
Louis, red?

409
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:06,910
Louis's always white, dear.

410
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:10,246
- White, please.
- Only our family did that!

411
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:14,125
It was a family thing.
Our thing! Mine, too.

412
00:28:14,167 --> 00:28:15,669
It was a tradition.

413
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:17,295
Do you need a hand?

414
00:28:17,337 --> 00:28:20,131
Nah, calms me, just getting ahead.

415
00:28:20,173 --> 00:28:22,092
I wanna tell my story!

416
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:24,427
Go on, let's get it over with.

417
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:26,846
Sunday was our day off.

418
00:28:27,097 --> 00:28:31,810
So we went out for a ride.
Systematically.

419
00:28:31,851 --> 00:28:33,603
Systematically!

420
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:36,147
It was like... a ritual.

421
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,400
What are you doing?

422
00:28:38,441 --> 00:28:40,110
Nothing. I'm listening.

423
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:41,778
Stay, Antoine.

424
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,324
Forget him. Listen to me.
He loves to upset me.

425
00:28:46,741 --> 00:28:50,829
So, we'd go on an outing.
And we'd take the car.

426
00:28:51,413 --> 00:28:53,915
Their dad always owned a car.

427
00:28:53,957 --> 00:28:57,544
Here, back then, owning a car...

428
00:28:57,961 --> 00:28:59,587
But he worked.

429
00:28:59,629 --> 00:29:00,839
It was his car.

430
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,801
It was old, ugly and noisy,
but it was his.

431
00:29:05,218 --> 00:29:07,178
Sunday mornings,
he washed it.

432
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:09,889
Washed the hell out of it.

433
00:29:09,931 --> 00:29:13,226
And after lunch...
Hop! Off we went.

434
00:29:13,643 --> 00:29:15,437
Every Sunday! A tradition.

435
00:29:15,478 --> 00:29:17,731
No vacations, but every Sunday,

436
00:29:17,772 --> 00:29:19,232
come shine or rain...

437
00:29:19,274 --> 00:29:22,444
No! "Come rain or shine,
hell or high water."

438
00:29:22,485 --> 00:29:26,031
Rain or shine, hell or high water.
You're right!

439
00:29:26,906 --> 00:29:31,286
He had expressions like that
for every situation in life.

440
00:29:31,328 --> 00:29:32,954
- He did?
- Yes.

441
00:29:32,996 --> 00:29:36,416
"He did?" You shitting me?
You know all this!

442
00:29:36,458 --> 00:29:38,501
Why tell stories we already know?

443
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:41,129
We do that in life,
stop being so stiff!

444
00:29:41,171 --> 00:29:44,799
We recall and relive
the things we love.

445
00:29:44,841 --> 00:29:48,511
I know she knows,
but I enjoy telling her again.

446
00:29:48,762 --> 00:29:51,097
That's why we remember! For me!

447
00:29:51,139 --> 00:29:52,390
Happy?

448
00:29:52,432 --> 00:29:55,101
If you hate it so much,
cover your ears,

449
00:29:55,143 --> 00:29:58,730
beat it and stop cheesing us off!

450
00:29:59,189 --> 00:30:00,357
Cheese off?

451
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:04,277
Damn right! Means piss off!
Your brother's specialty.

452
00:30:05,612 --> 00:30:10,033
So, the first Sunday in May,
or after March 8th...

453
00:30:10,075 --> 00:30:11,868
My birthday, of course.

454
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:16,706
Or if the 8th was a Sunday
we hit the jackpot!

455
00:30:17,374 --> 00:30:22,128
That was the real deal.
We'd drive an hour or two.

456
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:26,508
Fields, forests, castles,
vineyards, sometimes.

457
00:30:26,967 --> 00:30:31,429
We'd stroll, eat on the grass,
take a nap...

458
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,390
On the plaid blanket.

459
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:36,351
Tuna salad, rice,
mayo, deviled eggs.

460
00:30:36,393 --> 00:30:38,853
Antoine still loves
that salad, right?

461
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:41,106
Always says "Make your salad!"

462
00:30:42,482 --> 00:30:43,608
He's sulking.

463
00:30:44,526 --> 00:30:46,069
And then, uh...

464
00:30:46,903 --> 00:30:51,074
Night came, and we'd be weary
from the drive,

465
00:30:51,366 --> 00:30:55,245
and we'd walk in and say,
"Home, sweet home!"

466
00:30:56,871 --> 00:31:00,083
Proof that all those
fancy trips to the beach,

467
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:03,253
airports, planes,
sassy attendants...

468
00:31:04,879 --> 00:31:06,339
Anyway...

469
00:31:08,758 --> 00:31:12,262
Then, well,
the boys got older and...

470
00:31:15,265 --> 00:31:17,434
Well, Suzanne arrived!

471
00:31:18,101 --> 00:31:21,980
The boys had their bikes,
went their separate ways.

472
00:31:22,022 --> 00:31:24,858
And we stopped
the Sunday outings, `cause,

473
00:31:24,899 --> 00:31:28,111
with only Suzanne,
it wasn't worth it.

474
00:31:29,696 --> 00:31:31,573
Our fault, again.

475
00:31:32,073 --> 00:31:33,658
Or mine, Antoine.

476
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:36,619
Heavens!

477
00:31:37,037 --> 00:31:39,581
Suzanne, I don't believe it!

478
00:31:39,622 --> 00:31:42,000
Yeah, drop it, Mom!

479
00:31:42,042 --> 00:31:43,168
But...

480
00:31:43,209 --> 00:31:45,128
I'm gonna kill myself!

481
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:48,631
That's our day?
Dumb memories and shit music?

482
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:51,468
- Fucking hell!
- It's our song, Suzanne.

483
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:54,804
- Drop it, Mom! Jeez!
- Our aerobics song!

484
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:57,807
- We're taking off.
- Suzanne, come!

485
00:31:57,849 --> 00:31:59,434
You outta your mind?

486
00:31:59,476 --> 00:32:02,270
You do aerobics?

487
00:32:02,312 --> 00:32:04,439
Piss your pants!

488
00:32:04,481 --> 00:32:06,650
I adore this song.
Suzanne, come!

489
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:08,443
I'm obsessed,
it's a real find!

490
00:32:08,485 --> 00:32:10,362
Everybody found it, Mom!

491
00:32:10,403 --> 00:32:13,657
- You just live in a parallel world.
- I googled it.

492
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:16,618
Translation said it's about
Picasso being in love,

493
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:20,372
or Picasso...
Anyway, it wasn't clear.

494
00:32:20,413 --> 00:32:22,248
Come on, now!

495
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:23,541
No!

496
00:32:23,583 --> 00:32:26,670
Make it a perfect day,
impress your brother!

497
00:32:27,671 --> 00:32:29,297
Don't embarrass her!

498
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:32,342
Suzanne, please!

499
00:32:32,384 --> 00:32:35,387
Suzanne, come on!

500
00:32:35,428 --> 00:32:37,138
Come show them!

501
00:32:38,014 --> 00:32:40,517
All your moves are wrong,
it's a disaster.

502
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:41,893
Well then come.

503
00:32:41,935 --> 00:32:45,355
Show your poor old mom how to do it.

504
00:32:45,397 --> 00:32:47,315
Alright, one, two...

505
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:53,905
God, Mom, you're terrible!

506
00:32:53,947 --> 00:32:56,658
Looks like you're having a stroke.

507
00:33:00,203 --> 00:33:03,039
Mom, focus instead of
hitting on the teacher!

508
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:05,500
In his dreams, maybe!

509
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:06,329
Yes?

510
00:35:07,622 --> 00:35:10,625
Where are you,
why does it say unknown?

511
00:35:13,086 --> 00:35:14,671
Oh, right.

512
00:35:19,175 --> 00:35:20,885
Not yet, no.

513
00:35:26,433 --> 00:35:29,227
I've been here for an hour,
I can't just...

514
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:32,272
shove it in their face.

515
00:35:35,191 --> 00:35:38,528
It was tough with my sister.

516
00:35:40,822 --> 00:35:42,324
I don't know her.

517
00:35:44,743 --> 00:35:46,369
She's so pretty.

518
00:35:47,871 --> 00:35:50,957
And so much older. It's nuts.
The others too.

519
00:35:50,999 --> 00:35:54,127
And I am too, of course.
I don't see myself.

520
00:36:00,759 --> 00:36:03,470
I don't know, after lunch maybe.

521
00:36:04,054 --> 00:36:06,931
Over coffee and dessert.
I don't know.

522
00:36:07,515 --> 00:36:09,809
When the moment is right.

523
00:36:13,521 --> 00:36:16,691
I don't think I'll stay
after telling them.

524
00:36:19,653 --> 00:36:21,780
I don't know how they'll react.

525
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:24,115
Maybe they won't even cry.

526
00:36:25,575 --> 00:36:28,953
Listen, this isn't the time.

527
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,790
I'll call you later.

528
00:36:32,374 --> 00:36:33,375
Yeah.

529
00:36:35,877 --> 00:36:37,337
I'm scared.

530
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:39,631
I'm scared of them.

531
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:43,259
Okay. Alright.

532
00:36:44,094 --> 00:36:45,887
Me too. Ciao.

533
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:58,149
Sorry.

534
00:36:59,818 --> 00:37:01,027
Sorry.

535
00:37:01,069 --> 00:37:03,488
No, it's... Excuse me, sorry.

536
00:37:08,743 --> 00:37:10,370
Are you alright?

537
00:37:10,954 --> 00:37:12,622
- Uh... me?
- Yes, you.

538
00:37:12,664 --> 00:37:14,833
Yes. Why?

539
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,085
I don't know.

540
00:37:17,127 --> 00:37:20,171
You haven't said much since earlier.

541
00:37:23,466 --> 00:37:25,343
No, that's just...

542
00:37:25,635 --> 00:37:27,345
That's me.

543
00:37:30,307 --> 00:37:31,766
I'm fine.

544
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:35,395
What do you want me to say?

545
00:37:35,812 --> 00:37:37,397
Nothing.

546
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:43,486
I'm sorry about earlier, in there.

547
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:47,282
Antoine saying your kids
don't interest me.

548
00:37:48,992 --> 00:37:51,119
No idea why he said that.

549
00:37:51,661 --> 00:37:54,998
He loves to think
I'm not interested.

550
00:37:55,415 --> 00:37:57,542
I assume he must've...

551
00:37:57,834 --> 00:38:00,211
tried to turn you against me.

552
00:38:04,924 --> 00:38:07,719
Anyway, I'm sorry about that.

553
00:38:08,178 --> 00:38:10,805
I'd already forgotten about it.

554
00:38:11,556 --> 00:38:13,350
I...

555
00:38:15,644 --> 00:38:17,103
I'm used to it.

556
00:38:23,276 --> 00:38:26,154
But why would you say...

557
00:38:26,196 --> 00:38:30,325
that he tried to turn me
against you?

558
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:33,620
Just a thought.

559
00:38:33,995 --> 00:38:35,497
I know Antoine.

560
00:38:36,706 --> 00:38:38,208
You do?

561
00:38:43,004 --> 00:38:44,714
Sorry, I'm...

562
00:38:45,382 --> 00:38:48,677
It's weird you'd say that, 'cause...

563
00:38:49,302 --> 00:38:50,303
he...

564
00:38:51,596 --> 00:38:53,848
doesn't talk about you...

565
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:55,517
often...

566
00:38:57,435 --> 00:38:59,312
Almost never, actually.

567
00:39:00,563 --> 00:39:02,565
And when he does...

568
00:39:04,025 --> 00:39:05,652
No.

569
00:39:09,447 --> 00:39:12,325
I didn't mean to judge.
You're right.

570
00:39:16,579 --> 00:39:18,206
He thinks that...

571
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:23,086
you don't care about his life.

572
00:39:23,878 --> 00:39:28,216
Or him, me, the kids,
his job and all.

573
00:39:29,592 --> 00:39:33,096
D'you know what he does?
For a living?

574
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,181
Do you know his...

575
00:39:36,057 --> 00:39:39,185
I'm not criticizing...

576
00:39:39,227 --> 00:39:42,105
Really, don't take it as...

577
00:39:43,064 --> 00:39:45,483
- I'm not criticizing.
- No.

578
00:39:45,817 --> 00:39:46,860
But...

579
00:39:47,444 --> 00:39:49,571
do you know his job?

580
00:39:57,787 --> 00:39:59,998
He makes tools.

581
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:03,376
In a small shop, not from here.

582
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:08,131
And, even myself, I don't...

583
00:40:08,923 --> 00:40:10,842
know, exactly.

584
00:40:11,801 --> 00:40:14,471
But anyway, he...

585
00:40:14,721 --> 00:40:18,099
thinks his life
doesn't interest you.

586
00:40:18,141 --> 00:40:21,227
So, he... Well, that is...

587
00:40:22,771 --> 00:40:24,981
He believes, I think,

588
00:40:25,982 --> 00:40:28,109
that what he does, uh...

589
00:40:29,778 --> 00:40:34,032
is... unlikely to interest you.

590
00:40:37,285 --> 00:40:41,539
And I think he probably isn't...
entirely mistaken.

591
00:40:43,667 --> 00:40:47,087
Unless I'm wrong.
I might be wrong.

592
00:40:49,756 --> 00:40:51,591
Maybe you are.

593
00:40:56,262 --> 00:40:57,722
But today I was hoping...

594
00:40:57,764 --> 00:40:59,599
No, no, no.

595
00:40:59,641 --> 00:41:00,850
Wait...

596
00:41:00,892 --> 00:41:02,769
Don't tell me.

597
00:41:03,061 --> 00:41:04,729
Alright? Please.

598
00:41:06,272 --> 00:41:08,817
I'd prefer you to tell him.

599
00:41:08,858 --> 00:41:10,068
Alright.

600
00:41:10,777 --> 00:41:12,737
If you tell me,

601
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:17,867
it won't change anything.
It isn't my role. Alright?

602
00:41:19,202 --> 00:41:22,205
I wasn't actually
saying anything, Catherine.

603
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,124
- We're talking.
- Yes, but...

604
00:41:24,165 --> 00:41:27,711
I'm not good at talking.
And they...

605
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:31,506
They're...

606
00:41:31,923 --> 00:41:33,508
waiting for this.

607
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,136
- See you in a bit?
- Yes.

608
00:41:37,053 --> 00:41:39,055
- You're coming?
- Yeah.

609
00:42:32,067 --> 00:42:33,276
Louis.

610
00:42:33,318 --> 00:42:34,569
C'mere!

611
00:43:08,603 --> 00:43:11,106
Shut the door.
Antoine will see me.

612
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:18,279
He'll rag on me, again.
I'm at 3 per day, max, so...

613
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:20,615
I quit quitting.
I felt too dumb.

614
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:26,997
Hanging in there?

615
00:43:28,373 --> 00:43:29,916
Yeah, I'm fine.

616
00:43:33,586 --> 00:43:34,921
Three words.

617
00:43:34,963 --> 00:43:36,756
Same old, right.

618
00:43:38,091 --> 00:43:39,467
Always these...

619
00:43:39,509 --> 00:43:41,761
two or three-word answers.

620
00:43:43,096 --> 00:43:44,806
Like on your postcards.

621
00:43:46,725 --> 00:43:49,227
Or that little smile.

622
00:43:49,269 --> 00:43:50,562
Stop it.

623
00:43:54,566 --> 00:43:56,401
Did they talk to you?

624
00:43:57,694 --> 00:43:59,612
Suzanne just did, right?

625
00:44:00,238 --> 00:44:02,991
They have things to say, of course.

626
00:44:03,783 --> 00:44:06,411
They'll make the most of it.

627
00:44:07,746 --> 00:44:10,999
They don't know when
they'll have another chance.

628
00:44:15,962 --> 00:44:17,213
Suzanne...

629
00:44:19,924 --> 00:44:22,218
She's clueless, poor girl.

630
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:25,221
She doesn't know you.
Doesn't know much.

631
00:44:25,263 --> 00:44:28,224
She's pictured you
from what she's heard.

632
00:44:28,725 --> 00:44:30,685
And Antoine...

633
00:44:31,728 --> 00:44:34,731
You know him.
"My way, or no way."

634
00:44:37,776 --> 00:44:39,569
Problem is...

635
00:44:41,237 --> 00:44:42,489
Well...

636
00:44:43,865 --> 00:44:45,867
We're afraid of time.

637
00:44:46,618 --> 00:44:48,328
The time you give us.

638
00:44:50,497 --> 00:44:51,748
And I don't...

639
00:44:52,582 --> 00:44:55,710
pretend to think
you'll stay long...

640
00:44:56,086 --> 00:44:58,088
And that's fine.

641
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:02,050
But now you're here.

642
00:45:02,801 --> 00:45:04,260
So...

643
00:45:05,095 --> 00:45:06,638
Forgive them.

644
00:45:07,472 --> 00:45:10,141
Forgive, because...
they'll be...

645
00:45:10,725 --> 00:45:12,143
What's the word?

646
00:45:14,145 --> 00:45:15,689
Abrupt?

647
00:45:16,106 --> 00:45:17,732
Or clumsy.

648
00:45:18,775 --> 00:45:20,151
It doesn't matter.

649
00:45:20,193 --> 00:45:23,530
God, I can see them!

650
00:45:24,781 --> 00:45:29,035
Asking things, and you...
Three words, a little smile...

651
00:45:29,077 --> 00:45:30,912
You being you.

652
00:45:31,955 --> 00:45:33,373
Poor them.

653
00:45:33,415 --> 00:45:37,127
What if I don't only
have words to answer?

654
00:45:37,168 --> 00:45:39,421
What if I have words to say?

655
00:45:39,462 --> 00:45:41,339
Lucky us!

656
00:45:42,298 --> 00:45:43,925
I'm kidding.

657
00:45:49,014 --> 00:45:51,099
But it won't be enough.

658
00:45:52,309 --> 00:45:55,228
For Suzanne, until next time.

659
00:45:55,270 --> 00:45:57,272
I won't even ask when.

660
00:46:00,692 --> 00:46:02,444
And Antoine, well...

661
00:46:03,903 --> 00:46:06,072
He'll be more bitter about you,

662
00:46:07,324 --> 00:46:09,492
even more lost.

663
00:46:11,953 --> 00:46:15,206
Suzanne wants to leave.
She told you.

664
00:46:16,583 --> 00:46:21,129
Go and live her life some place.
Far away, of course.

665
00:46:24,257 --> 00:46:26,968
Antoine... he'd like more freedom.

666
00:46:27,844 --> 00:46:29,471
I can feel it.

667
00:46:30,096 --> 00:46:32,557
Not to owe anything.

668
00:46:32,599 --> 00:46:35,477
To whom?
Everyone, I guess.

669
00:46:36,186 --> 00:46:39,689
Me, above all.
And Suzanne, too.

670
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:44,778
They want to confide this
in you, Louis!

671
00:46:44,819 --> 00:46:48,239
They need your approval.

672
00:46:48,948 --> 00:46:52,994
You never took responsibility,
and I'm not asking you to.

673
00:46:53,036 --> 00:46:54,663
I'm not the eldest, Martine.

674
00:46:55,038 --> 00:46:56,915
I'm not the surrogate father...

675
00:46:56,956 --> 00:46:58,667
Cut the crap, Louis!

676
00:46:59,501 --> 00:47:03,213
Don't play dumb.
Use your head a bit.

677
00:47:03,254 --> 00:47:05,757
Age has nothing to do with it.

678
00:47:06,341 --> 00:47:08,718
Doesn't make you
the man of the house.

679
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:11,346
I was, as a child!

680
00:47:12,055 --> 00:47:15,183
Status, salary, luck,

681
00:47:15,225 --> 00:47:17,435
beauty, gifts, courage!

682
00:47:17,727 --> 00:47:20,480
The things you're born with,
or without!

683
00:47:21,815 --> 00:47:24,067
Should I keep going?

684
00:47:24,109 --> 00:47:25,735
Who's the writer, here?

685
00:47:32,242 --> 00:47:34,452
I know you won't come back.

686
00:47:41,876 --> 00:47:43,753
Encourage them.

687
00:47:44,337 --> 00:47:45,964
No one ever did.

688
00:47:46,381 --> 00:47:50,593
I did, but I don't count,
my words don't matter.

689
00:47:50,844 --> 00:47:52,929
Encourage them, Louis.

690
00:47:54,222 --> 00:47:57,434
Give them your permission
to do this, or that.

691
00:47:57,475 --> 00:48:02,605
Tell Suzanne, even if it's just
hot air, an empty promise,

692
00:48:02,647 --> 00:48:07,402
"Suzanne, why don't you
come visit me?"

693
00:48:08,778 --> 00:48:10,488
Tell her she can.

694
00:48:10,905 --> 00:48:13,283
That she has the right.

695
00:48:23,668 --> 00:48:25,920
You're still in the homo ghetto?

696
00:48:29,466 --> 00:48:30,800
Yes or no?

697
00:48:30,842 --> 00:48:33,345
No. I've moved.

698
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:35,388
What?

699
00:48:36,056 --> 00:48:38,475
I still write there, dummy!

700
00:48:38,516 --> 00:48:41,144
Someone picks up the mail for me.

701
00:48:41,186 --> 00:48:43,980
Don't worry. I like it that way.

702
00:48:52,781 --> 00:48:55,700
You like your mother not knowing
where you live?

703
00:48:57,243 --> 00:48:58,870
Holy shit.

704
00:49:00,955 --> 00:49:02,374
That's funny.

705
00:49:02,415 --> 00:49:04,000
I mean...

706
00:49:04,793 --> 00:49:06,670
You're funny.

707
00:49:09,381 --> 00:49:11,633
You still don't get it.

708
00:49:13,301 --> 00:49:15,679
Think we don't love you?

709
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,347
Or understand you?

710
00:49:21,685 --> 00:49:23,395
You're right.

711
00:49:23,895 --> 00:49:25,730
I don't understand you.

712
00:49:27,607 --> 00:49:29,317
But I love you.

713
00:49:30,777 --> 00:49:32,404
I love you.

714
00:49:39,494 --> 00:49:42,622
No one will take that away from me.

715
00:49:48,503 --> 00:49:52,173
Write that one down,
for one of your plays.

716
00:50:02,726 --> 00:50:04,269
Why are you here?

717
00:50:07,272 --> 00:50:09,274
You can tell your mother.

718
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,737
You thought, "Heck!
It's been 12 years!

719
00:50:13,778 --> 00:50:15,739
Let's grab a bite on the patio!"

720
00:50:29,919 --> 00:50:32,255
Well, you look great, I'm glad.

721
00:50:33,882 --> 00:50:35,800
Damn it!

722
00:50:36,343 --> 00:50:38,595
Where's that thingy?

723
00:50:40,096 --> 00:50:41,890
How old are you now?

724
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:43,224
Me?

725
00:50:43,266 --> 00:50:44,893
No, the watering can!

726
00:50:46,728 --> 00:50:48,772
Saint-Anthony came around.

727
00:50:50,815 --> 00:50:54,235
For the kisses, for Antoine,
for the food,

728
00:50:55,403 --> 00:50:56,780
and for me.

729
00:50:58,365 --> 00:50:59,908
Here.

730
00:51:00,450 --> 00:51:04,287
Tell me if I should get it.
As a Christmas gift.

731
00:51:04,954 --> 00:51:06,456
To me, from me.

732
00:52:20,488 --> 00:52:22,407
I'm 34.

733
00:52:24,117 --> 00:52:25,910
Oh, my...

734
00:52:31,791 --> 00:52:34,294
It's been 34 years
for me too, then.

735
00:52:35,712 --> 00:52:37,172
Is that a long time?

736
00:52:37,505 --> 00:52:39,341
I can't tell anymore.

737
00:52:44,429 --> 00:52:47,390
Look, just do what
you have to do, Louis.

738
00:52:54,356 --> 00:52:56,232
Gosh, that's crazy.

739
00:53:01,029 --> 00:53:02,697
I just...

740
00:53:03,782 --> 00:53:06,409
I wish I could take a photo,
you've got...

741
00:53:07,827 --> 00:53:11,122
your father's eyes,
right here, right now.

742
00:53:18,254 --> 00:53:19,964
Well, anywho...

743
00:53:20,006 --> 00:53:24,219
There's no need for tears
or declarations today.

744
00:53:24,844 --> 00:53:26,888
I was saying that...

745
00:53:27,931 --> 00:53:29,349
for the future.

746
00:53:29,391 --> 00:53:31,142
Gotta think about it!

747
00:53:40,443 --> 00:53:43,822
But the day should end
as it started,

748
00:53:43,863 --> 00:53:46,825
without obligations,
without intention.

749
00:53:47,325 --> 00:53:51,246
And well, quite simply...
Just... well.

750
00:53:59,212 --> 00:54:00,922
Of course.

751
00:54:02,424 --> 00:54:05,260
That idiot called her hens Denise.

752
00:54:05,302 --> 00:54:07,554
She's mentally challenged.

753
00:54:07,595 --> 00:54:09,597
I walk in the hen house,

754
00:54:09,639 --> 00:54:11,850
hens running everywhere.

755
00:54:11,891 --> 00:54:15,020
I go "Look at your cute hens!"

756
00:54:15,061 --> 00:54:18,648
"What did you name 'em?"
"I named 'em Denise!"

757
00:54:20,108 --> 00:54:22,694
So I go "That's pretty.
Which one is Denise?"

758
00:54:22,736 --> 00:54:25,405
She goes "They're all named Denise!"

759
00:54:27,490 --> 00:54:29,826
I called all of them Denise.

760
00:54:34,748 --> 00:54:37,625
Will I go to hell
if I love that story?

761
00:54:37,667 --> 00:54:39,294
Why hell?

762
00:54:39,336 --> 00:54:42,672
Well, she's got Down's syndrome.

763
00:54:42,714 --> 00:54:45,508
Whatever syndrome,
a hell of a big one.

764
00:54:45,550 --> 00:54:49,054
Down, Up, Wide... She's got it.

765
00:54:49,429 --> 00:54:53,016
Someone could've told her,,
"Don't call them all Denise."

766
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:55,894
I don't like it much.

767
00:54:57,103 --> 00:54:58,897
I don't like it...

768
00:54:58,938 --> 00:55:01,691
I find it mean,
and unseemly.

769
00:55:01,941 --> 00:55:04,027
It's funny, c'mon!

770
00:55:07,989 --> 00:55:10,200
St. Catherine's among us.

771
00:55:10,450 --> 00:55:12,035
- You alright?
- Yeah.

772
00:55:12,577 --> 00:55:13,620
Why?

773
00:55:13,662 --> 00:55:15,372
I dunno. You wanna...

774
00:55:15,413 --> 00:55:18,083
Do something else,
go for a walk, or...

775
00:55:18,625 --> 00:55:21,795
- play games.
- You and your fucking games.

776
00:55:21,836 --> 00:55:23,630
Get off my friggin' back!

777
00:55:23,672 --> 00:55:26,174
I don't know about games but,

778
00:55:26,216 --> 00:55:28,468
actually, I would've loved...

779
00:55:32,013 --> 00:55:35,100
- Well...
- What? The old house?

780
00:55:35,141 --> 00:55:37,185
- Yes.
- What?

781
00:55:37,227 --> 00:55:39,813
He wants to see
the old house.

782
00:55:39,854 --> 00:55:42,357
I don't mind.
I can drive you.

783
00:55:42,399 --> 00:55:45,610
Why d'you wanna go there?
Are you daft?

784
00:55:45,902 --> 00:55:48,488
He's not daft, let him be.

785
00:55:48,530 --> 00:55:51,074
- You're daft!
- You're stupid!

786
00:55:51,116 --> 00:55:54,995
But Louis, really,
why d'you want to go there?

787
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:58,415
Did you forget something
in your room?

788
00:56:00,291 --> 00:56:02,043
No.

789
00:56:03,795 --> 00:56:05,880
I don't know, I just do.

790
00:56:06,673 --> 00:56:08,758
I'm curious to...

791
00:56:09,592 --> 00:56:11,594
see the surroundings,

792
00:56:12,012 --> 00:56:14,639
how they've evolved...

793
00:56:14,931 --> 00:56:17,976
How time has modified or...

794
00:56:18,393 --> 00:56:20,228
wrecked them.

795
00:56:21,438 --> 00:56:25,025
It's not even for sale.
You can't visit it.

796
00:56:25,066 --> 00:56:28,278
I drove by last week, and...

797
00:56:28,695 --> 00:56:30,613
it's completely abandoned.

798
00:56:31,865 --> 00:56:35,785
You wanna go back to that shithole,

799
00:56:36,411 --> 00:56:41,124
to see how time has wrecked,
modified it.

800
00:56:41,374 --> 00:56:44,794
Is that the most la-di-da
shit plan you got?

801
00:56:44,836 --> 00:56:45,962
Antoine.

802
00:56:46,004 --> 00:56:49,924
I meant no offense but...

803
00:56:49,966 --> 00:56:51,426
Of course not.

804
00:56:51,468 --> 00:56:54,721
It took us 20 years
to get outta there,

805
00:56:54,763 --> 00:56:59,142
and you want to go see
if the wind has wafted

806
00:56:59,184 --> 00:57:02,937
the autumn leaves
onto the rusted roof?

807
00:57:02,979 --> 00:57:05,440
What the fuck? Who cares?

808
00:57:05,482 --> 00:57:09,235
Leave him alone, he just
wants to go for a ride.

809
00:57:09,277 --> 00:57:10,695
I mean...

810
00:57:11,738 --> 00:57:14,658
I'll come with you,
Louis, if you want.

811
00:57:14,699 --> 00:57:16,284
Doesn't matter.

812
00:57:16,326 --> 00:57:18,995
- It was a bad idea.
- No shit!

813
00:57:19,037 --> 00:57:22,582
I'll beat off in Auschwitz,
jizz out a poem!

814
00:57:22,624 --> 00:57:24,959
Antoine! Bad taste!

815
00:57:25,001 --> 00:57:26,378
Alrighty, Louis!

816
00:57:27,462 --> 00:57:30,965
Give us some gossip!

817
00:57:31,007 --> 00:57:32,592
Let's dish!

818
00:57:33,677 --> 00:57:35,261
I don't know any.

819
00:57:35,303 --> 00:57:37,430
Well, make it up!

820
00:57:37,931 --> 00:57:40,266
You know, showbiz gossip!

821
00:57:40,308 --> 00:57:44,062
Who screwed who, who was screwed.

822
00:57:44,396 --> 00:57:46,022
Your fingers stink.
You smoked?

823
00:57:46,064 --> 00:57:47,107
Wine, Louis?

824
00:57:47,148 --> 00:57:48,942
- No thanks.
- You smoked.

825
00:57:51,319 --> 00:57:53,905
I don't know any gossip.
I don't go out.

826
00:57:57,325 --> 00:58:00,537
Coffee, Mr. Louis?
I was going to make a pot.

827
00:58:00,578 --> 00:58:04,082
What century d'you
Misses and Misters live in?

828
00:58:04,124 --> 00:58:06,710
What's it to you, dumbass?

829
00:58:06,751 --> 00:58:09,379
For fuck's sake,
am I talking to you?

830
00:58:09,421 --> 00:58:11,965
Stop fucking picking on me,

831
00:58:12,298 --> 00:58:14,134
telling me to shut up.

832
00:58:14,467 --> 00:58:16,386
Telling me I'm stupid.

833
00:58:16,428 --> 00:58:18,346
Stay the fuck outta this.

834
00:58:18,388 --> 00:58:20,849
Kids, no. Not this.

835
00:58:20,890 --> 00:58:23,351
Do you hear that?
What's that tone?

836
00:58:23,768 --> 00:58:25,645
It's well deserved.

837
00:58:30,150 --> 00:58:33,528
- You never talk to me like that.
- I'm starting!

838
00:58:33,570 --> 00:58:36,906
That's my tone when
you fucking annoy me!

839
00:58:41,995 --> 00:58:43,955
Never mind, I got it.

840
00:58:44,247 --> 00:58:47,042
That's too cute!
You're a cutie pie...

841
00:58:47,292 --> 00:58:48,668
Aren't you?

842
00:58:48,710 --> 00:58:53,381
Wanna look cool in front of
your bro? 'Cause he's here?

843
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:56,092
This is for you, Louis.

844
00:58:56,468 --> 00:58:59,679
Is it working?
Are you impressed, Loulou?

845
00:58:59,721 --> 00:59:01,765
Rou-lou-cou-lou-lou!

846
00:59:03,308 --> 00:59:05,226
Loulou! Yoohoo!

847
00:59:06,394 --> 00:59:10,523
This is a load of bullshit.
It's bullshit. Mom!

848
00:59:10,565 --> 00:59:12,442
Suzanne, the neighbors!

849
00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:16,446
You make no sense!

850
00:59:16,488 --> 00:59:18,740
This isn't about Louis!

851
00:59:18,782 --> 00:59:22,786
Why d'you always humiliate me?
Humiliate everyone!

852
00:59:23,161 --> 00:59:25,413
This day fucking sucks!

853
00:59:26,456 --> 00:59:28,249
Suzanne, come back!

854
00:59:28,291 --> 00:59:31,086
Gosh, and you just let her go!

855
00:59:31,503 --> 00:59:32,754
She'll be back.

856
00:59:34,381 --> 00:59:36,675
Lord. Such a shame.

857
00:59:42,347 --> 00:59:44,599
Catherine, I'd fancy
a cup of coffee.

858
00:59:44,641 --> 00:59:48,144
"Catherine, I'd fancy
a cup of coffee."

859
00:59:48,186 --> 00:59:49,229
Antoine.

860
00:59:49,270 --> 00:59:52,774
What? Antoine, Antoine!
Yes, Antoine! What?

861
00:59:52,816 --> 00:59:54,985
That's my goddamn name, yeah!

862
00:59:55,026 --> 00:59:57,988
All day long!
Fucking pain in the ass!

863
01:00:06,413 --> 01:00:07,414
Fine.

864
01:00:08,164 --> 01:00:10,417
I'll work on my timing!

865
01:00:10,458 --> 01:00:14,337
I was about to say
it's lovely being together.

866
01:00:17,632 --> 01:00:19,634
Later, maybe.

867
01:00:30,770 --> 01:00:32,439
Excuse me, Catherine.

868
01:00:32,814 --> 01:00:34,232
No worries.

869
01:00:53,335 --> 01:00:57,005
We're not complete boors.
What's wrong with you?

870
01:00:57,339 --> 01:00:59,924
Why are you being so hostile?

871
01:04:26,965 --> 01:04:28,133
Louis?

872
01:04:30,468 --> 01:04:32,429
- Sorry.
- Sorry!

873
01:04:33,888 --> 01:04:37,017
I'm... Martine's asking for you.

874
01:04:37,058 --> 01:04:41,146
Dessert will be ready in 30 or 40.
Would that be alright?

875
01:04:41,521 --> 01:04:43,148
I'll be right up.

876
01:04:43,189 --> 01:04:44,691
Alright.

877
01:04:45,358 --> 01:04:46,609
Sorry.

878
01:05:09,215 --> 01:05:10,842
How much time?

879
01:05:28,735 --> 01:05:30,737
How much time what?

880
01:05:35,158 --> 01:05:37,952
How much time...

881
01:05:42,248 --> 01:05:44,042
Will you, um...

882
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:48,963
Antoine's alone upstairs and...

883
01:05:50,298 --> 01:05:52,342
You could talk to him.

884
01:05:58,932 --> 01:06:00,725
I'm coming.

885
01:06:36,344 --> 01:06:37,887
So, um...

886
01:06:38,888 --> 01:06:40,515
I need a smoke.

887
01:06:41,474 --> 01:06:43,143
Gotta buy smokes.

888
01:06:43,184 --> 01:06:45,687
Well, you can... Never mind.

889
01:06:46,396 --> 01:06:47,689
Yeah, I know.

890
01:06:48,189 --> 01:06:51,151
Don't rat out Mom,
I hate her fancy cigs.

891
01:06:51,192 --> 01:06:53,528
I never smoke but when I smoke...

892
01:06:53,945 --> 01:06:55,280
I smoke.

893
01:06:57,198 --> 01:06:59,909
- And you need to smoke, right now.
- Mm-hmm.

894
01:07:02,954 --> 01:07:06,750
You coming? If you want,
in the car, we could...

895
01:07:07,417 --> 01:07:08,418
What?

896
01:07:08,918 --> 01:07:12,756
- Talk?
- No. I mean... I guess, yeah.

897
01:07:14,924 --> 01:07:16,134
Yeah.

898
01:07:17,260 --> 01:07:19,721
- I need some fresh air.
- Well, then.

899
01:07:20,722 --> 01:07:22,015
Done.

900
01:07:25,352 --> 01:07:28,480
I actually flew in early.
Traveled overnight.

901
01:07:29,022 --> 01:07:32,359
I wanted to see the sunrise
at the airport,

902
01:07:32,817 --> 01:07:34,778
eat at the small café.

903
01:07:36,154 --> 01:07:40,533
Thought I'd come
for breakfast, but...

904
01:07:41,826 --> 01:07:44,663
I waited for the proper moment.

905
01:07:45,830 --> 01:07:48,833
You're telling me this... because?

906
01:07:49,501 --> 01:07:51,836
What should I say?
Anything specific?

907
01:07:51,878 --> 01:07:55,965
No. I don't know,
just wanted you to know.

908
01:07:56,341 --> 01:07:57,884
It's not important.

909
01:07:58,677 --> 01:08:02,180
I told you 'cause it's true.
I wanted to tell you.

910
01:08:03,598 --> 01:08:05,016
Listen...

911
01:08:05,058 --> 01:08:06,685
Don't start, okay?

912
01:08:14,275 --> 01:08:15,777
Don't start what?

913
01:08:15,819 --> 01:08:17,737
This, Louis. This.

914
01:08:17,779 --> 01:08:21,491
Don't smother me
with airport stories...

915
01:08:21,533 --> 01:08:25,370
Should've come earlier, later...
I drown in that crap.

916
01:08:25,412 --> 01:08:26,621
Not in the mood.

917
01:08:31,584 --> 01:08:35,588
So you traveled last night?
How was it?

918
01:08:38,550 --> 01:08:40,218
Come on!

919
01:08:40,468 --> 01:08:44,139
It went fine, I guess.
It's a short trip.

920
01:08:44,556 --> 01:08:48,018
You guys think I live on
another planet.

921
01:08:48,059 --> 01:08:51,021
Coming here's not
the end of the world.

922
01:08:51,479 --> 01:08:54,149
But if you don't want to talk,
it's fine.

923
01:08:54,190 --> 01:08:55,608
Please!

924
01:08:55,942 --> 01:08:58,069
I'm listening, alright?

925
01:08:58,653 --> 01:09:01,072
Go on, tell me.

926
01:09:01,489 --> 01:09:03,700
I want you to. Come on!

927
01:09:03,742 --> 01:09:06,619
I want to know.
The airport, the café.

928
01:09:06,953 --> 01:09:09,289
The heat's driving us nuts, okay?

929
01:09:09,331 --> 01:09:11,624
No, you're right.
It's irrelevant.

930
01:09:13,460 --> 01:09:16,338
I just thought that...
I don't know.

931
01:09:17,130 --> 01:09:21,468
You'd be happy... or glad.
To know that, this morning

932
01:09:21,509 --> 01:09:25,096
I was at the airport café.
Remember the café?

933
01:09:25,555 --> 01:09:26,931
Waiting.

934
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:31,645
I couldn't show up at dawn
and scare them.

935
01:09:32,562 --> 01:09:36,983
I can see Suzanne
on the porch, with a shotgun.

936
01:09:38,109 --> 01:09:40,278
She's such a pothead.

937
01:09:40,737 --> 01:09:44,616
She'd grab it upside down,
blow a hole in her head!

938
01:09:46,826 --> 01:09:48,286
You done?

939
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:51,289
I was waiting,
thus I said to myself...

940
01:09:51,331 --> 01:09:52,415
Thus?

941
01:09:52,457 --> 01:09:53,583
Thus!

942
01:09:53,958 --> 01:09:55,126
Thus!

943
01:09:55,627 --> 01:09:58,004
- Thus...
- I was waiting, and...

944
01:09:58,296 --> 01:10:01,967
I thought I'd tell you about this.

945
01:10:02,008 --> 01:10:04,386
About being there, doing nothing.

946
01:10:04,636 --> 01:10:06,513
Thought you'd get it.

947
01:10:07,222 --> 01:10:10,809
So I'm telling you.
Only you, not them.

948
01:10:11,142 --> 01:10:15,814
They'd be upset that we could've
spent more time together.

949
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:20,276
Hanging out there felt good.

950
01:10:20,318 --> 01:10:23,655
- You know how...
- See, that's just... That's it!

951
01:10:24,572 --> 01:10:27,492
This is exactly what I meant. This.

952
01:10:27,534 --> 01:10:31,621
That crap I have to listen to.
What's true, what's not...

953
01:10:31,663 --> 01:10:33,873
I knew it, I'm not dumb.

954
01:10:37,335 --> 01:10:39,129
I didn't forget that.

955
01:10:39,170 --> 01:10:42,424
Your endless stories,
and words, words, words,

956
01:10:42,465 --> 01:10:46,136
to confuse us, and fuck us over!

957
01:10:46,469 --> 01:10:49,472
You get away with it,
and I'm lost!

958
01:10:50,515 --> 01:10:54,686
- You're sick, Antoine.
- I'm sick now? No, you're sick!

959
01:10:55,103 --> 01:10:58,940
I know your little story!
The airport, the café...

960
01:10:58,982 --> 01:11:02,569
And what else? All those details...

961
01:11:02,610 --> 01:11:08,074
A dude cooking fries, your clothes
soaking up the smell of grease...

962
01:11:08,116 --> 01:11:12,370
And you were alone, all alone
in the airport, weren't you?

963
01:11:12,954 --> 01:11:15,165
You could hear a pin drop.

964
01:11:15,665 --> 01:11:19,294
So, you're there.
Reading your paper?

965
01:11:19,336 --> 01:11:21,421
I bet you are!

966
01:11:21,463 --> 01:11:23,423
Or some money magazine,

967
01:11:23,465 --> 01:11:26,343
with the shiny paper
and the big red letters...

968
01:11:33,683 --> 01:11:37,687
And I don't know either
why you came, Louis.

969
01:11:38,146 --> 01:11:40,774
No one knows. No one understands.

970
01:11:40,815 --> 01:11:43,526
And you hate that,
'cause if we knew...

971
01:11:43,568 --> 01:11:45,987
Oh, it'd be easy!

972
01:11:46,029 --> 01:11:50,200
You'd have taken off already,
or wouldn't have come!

973
01:11:51,493 --> 01:11:53,286
But you think that matters?

974
01:11:53,328 --> 01:11:58,333
Think airports, cafés,
magazines matter to me?

975
01:11:58,667 --> 01:12:02,462
You're wrong, buddy!
It doesn't matter at all!

976
01:12:02,837 --> 01:12:04,964
It doesn't matter anymore!

977
01:12:06,675 --> 01:12:10,178
That's not what you thought
at the airport.

978
01:12:10,220 --> 01:12:12,764
Or you weren't going to tell me.

979
01:12:13,181 --> 01:12:16,977
You're saying that to fill
the void between us.

980
01:12:17,602 --> 01:12:21,231
Bam, I'm here!
So you're making shit up.

981
01:12:21,272 --> 01:12:24,567
You made all that up
to talk to me?

982
01:12:24,609 --> 01:12:27,612
So I'd feel special.

983
01:12:28,113 --> 01:12:29,572
Special?

984
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:34,077
To know you could've
spent more time with us?

985
01:12:35,829 --> 01:12:38,790
You didn't think that.
We're strangers.

986
01:12:38,832 --> 01:12:41,001
Strangers share nothing.

987
01:12:41,042 --> 01:12:44,587
We're strangers, Louis.
Haven't we always been?

988
01:12:45,296 --> 01:12:48,216
You thought "I'll take that angle,

989
01:12:48,258 --> 01:12:50,468
so I can handle him."

990
01:12:51,469 --> 01:12:52,554
You thought...

991
01:12:52,595 --> 01:12:57,309
"I've studied, lived, written...
I can handle him."

992
01:12:57,350 --> 01:13:00,103
Funny. People say that of me...

993
01:13:00,145 --> 01:13:02,564
He's hard to handle.

994
01:13:02,856 --> 01:13:05,317
"Handle Antoine with kid gloves!"

995
01:13:05,358 --> 01:13:08,862
Like an animal in a cage.

996
01:13:08,903 --> 01:13:11,406
That you pet. And kill.

997
01:13:11,448 --> 01:13:14,159
That's what you did
at the airport, Louis.

998
01:13:15,118 --> 01:13:19,497
You thought you had a technique
to grab me.

999
01:13:20,707 --> 01:13:22,917
But I'm not in the mood.

1000
01:13:23,168 --> 01:13:25,837
I'm not interested.

1001
01:13:26,379 --> 01:13:30,091
What are you doing here?
I don't wanna know!

1002
01:13:30,842 --> 01:13:32,218
I don't care.

1003
01:13:32,719 --> 01:13:35,555
You're here, you're not.
That's your problem.

1004
01:13:35,597 --> 01:13:40,143
You're home. You come,
you go, you stay. Fine.

1005
01:13:40,185 --> 01:13:42,896
Not everything's so great
in your small life.

1006
01:13:42,937 --> 01:13:45,482
- `Cause it is small.
- Antoine, slow down.

1007
01:13:45,523 --> 01:13:50,570
You were at the airport café,
thinking about sweet nothing!

1008
01:13:50,612 --> 01:13:53,365
The coffee's giving you the runs,

1009
01:13:53,406 --> 01:13:55,617
you're thinking about no one!

1010
01:13:55,659 --> 01:13:58,620
You're there,
living your fucking life,

1011
01:13:58,662 --> 01:14:01,539
so get the fuck over it already!

1012
01:15:13,778 --> 01:15:15,155
- Antoine?
- No.

1013
01:15:15,655 --> 01:15:19,367
I don't wanna be here.
And listen to you. Or talk.

1014
01:15:21,328 --> 01:15:22,912
I'm scared. You happy?

1015
01:15:27,375 --> 01:15:30,420
You guys always have to
tell me everything.

1016
01:15:30,462 --> 01:15:31,796
And I have to listen

1017
01:15:32,297 --> 01:15:34,799
I hate listening. I hate talking.

1018
01:15:39,095 --> 01:15:42,182
We think silent people
are good listeners.

1019
01:15:43,016 --> 01:15:46,144
But I shut up so people
leave me alone.

1020
01:15:47,145 --> 01:15:48,647
Do you get that?

1021
01:15:52,150 --> 01:15:53,401
Do you?

1022
01:15:54,944 --> 01:15:56,446
I do.

1023
01:15:57,947 --> 01:15:59,199
Amazing.

1024
01:16:07,082 --> 01:16:08,208
By the way...

1025
01:16:08,958 --> 01:16:11,127
Pierre died last week. Cancer.

1026
01:16:11,878 --> 01:16:13,004
Pierre?

1027
01:16:13,046 --> 01:16:14,881
Jolicoeur.

1028
01:16:16,633 --> 01:16:18,677
Pierre Jolicoeur, your Pierre.

1029
01:16:27,435 --> 01:16:30,522
I better help with dessert
or they'll gimme hell.

1030
01:17:00,385 --> 01:17:02,137
Antoine, is that you?

1031
01:17:04,556 --> 01:17:06,266
Where is everyone?

1032
01:17:06,766 --> 01:17:09,269
- What?
- Where are the others?

1033
01:17:09,311 --> 01:17:10,603
I dunno.

1034
01:17:10,645 --> 01:17:11,980
Here.

1035
01:17:12,022 --> 01:17:13,815
Hold this while I...

1036
01:17:16,943 --> 01:17:19,696
<i>I think I heard someone come in.</i>

1037
01:17:20,030 --> 01:17:24,034
<i>Shouldn't I go get everyone?
I think it was Antoine.</i>

1038
01:17:24,075 --> 01:17:26,328
<i>They'll come when they're ready.</i>

1039
01:17:26,369 --> 01:17:27,912
<i>Help me with this.</i>

1040
01:17:37,589 --> 01:17:38,882
I don't get it.

1041
01:17:38,923 --> 01:17:39,966
What?

1042
01:17:42,385 --> 01:17:43,803
Think you're alone?

1043
01:17:48,016 --> 01:17:49,809
You're handsome when you smile.

1044
01:17:53,396 --> 01:17:58,443
You think we're alone?
Think Mom gets any of this?

1045
01:18:02,030 --> 01:18:04,741
No one gets it.
Never did, never will.

1046
01:18:05,700 --> 01:18:07,952
That's the beauty of it, right?

1047
01:18:08,662 --> 01:18:11,247
<i>I think Antoine and Louis
had a fight.</i>

1048
01:18:11,289 --> 01:18:12,874
Get outta here.

1049
01:18:16,127 --> 01:18:16,961
Antoine!

1050
01:18:18,463 --> 01:18:20,215
Yeah, coming!

1051
01:18:22,592 --> 01:18:23,885
There was no drama...

1052
01:18:23,927 --> 01:18:26,972
I was young, I can't remember,
but there was no drama...

1053
01:18:27,013 --> 01:18:29,724
tragic stuff, or betrayals,

1054
01:18:30,308 --> 01:18:31,643
or murders.

1055
01:18:32,936 --> 01:18:34,980
Shit like that...
So he'd avoid us.

1056
01:18:35,021 --> 01:18:36,272
He doesn't care.

1057
01:18:38,274 --> 01:18:40,819
<i>He doesn't feel the need for "us".</i>

1058
01:18:41,319 --> 01:18:42,696
<i>He wants to be far.</i>

1059
01:18:42,737 --> 01:18:45,407
<i>He's almost farther
sitting on our couch.</i>

1060
01:18:46,241 --> 01:18:47,367
He's the sad one.

1061
01:18:47,409 --> 01:18:50,787
He missed all those years,
never saw you grow.

1062
01:18:51,663 --> 01:18:53,164
And life went on,

1063
01:18:53,665 --> 01:18:56,584
<i>as it does today, invariably.</i>

1064
01:18:56,626 --> 01:18:58,128
Just like in books.

1065
01:19:13,893 --> 01:19:17,147
<i>You're unhappy, but only
'cause it's convenient.</i>

1066
01:19:17,188 --> 01:19:20,567
<i>- So choose to be happy.
- Easy to say.</i>

1067
01:19:20,608 --> 01:19:22,485
Anyway, it's almost over.

1068
01:19:22,527 --> 01:19:24,696
Really? Why?

1069
01:20:08,031 --> 01:20:08,990
So...

1070
01:20:09,032 --> 01:20:10,700
Yep!

1071
01:20:10,992 --> 01:20:14,371
Appetizers, mains,
finger food... Nope.

1072
01:20:14,996 --> 01:20:18,208
But desserts?
I'm just unbeatable.

1073
01:20:25,090 --> 01:20:26,675
I...

1074
01:20:27,550 --> 01:20:29,636
I've got something to tell you.

1075
01:20:30,053 --> 01:20:31,554
Things, actually.

1076
01:20:36,643 --> 01:20:38,228
I'll come back.

1077
01:20:38,728 --> 01:20:40,313
And more often.

1078
01:20:42,607 --> 01:20:44,401
And write.

1079
01:20:45,652 --> 01:20:47,237
More often.

1080
01:20:47,612 --> 01:20:50,031
Not just two
or three words.

1081
01:20:51,616 --> 01:20:53,243
Because...

1082
01:20:56,037 --> 01:20:57,789
I regret it all.

1083
01:20:59,833 --> 01:21:03,086
The time we've wasted.
The time I've wasted.

1084
01:21:07,757 --> 01:21:11,344
Suzanne, if you want to visit,
you're welcome.

1085
01:21:11,386 --> 01:21:14,931
For a weekend, or longer,
as you wish. We'll set it...

1086
01:21:19,811 --> 01:21:21,771
And Antoine...

1087
01:21:22,063 --> 01:21:23,940
If we had dinner,

1088
01:21:23,982 --> 01:21:26,818
we could continue
the conversation we began,

1089
01:21:26,860 --> 01:21:28,611
calmly.

1090
01:21:29,154 --> 01:21:30,822
When I'm back. Or you come.

1091
01:21:30,864 --> 01:21:32,866
I can't. Too much work.

1092
01:21:32,907 --> 01:21:34,659
A weekend?

1093
01:21:36,536 --> 01:21:37,996
Just a weekend.

1094
01:21:38,413 --> 01:21:39,664
Weekends are just as...

1095
01:21:39,706 --> 01:21:42,459
Everyone can survive
a weekend, Antoine.

1096
01:21:44,961 --> 01:21:47,547
You can. You have the right to.

1097
01:21:51,009 --> 01:21:54,429
- You love the city.
- I love the city, now?

1098
01:21:58,892 --> 01:22:00,644
You always did.

1099
01:22:36,513 --> 01:22:38,431
Truth is, I have to go.

1100
01:22:43,395 --> 01:22:46,022
- What are you doing?
- What's wrong?

1101
01:22:46,064 --> 01:22:49,609
When all is well,
Antoine messes things up!

1102
01:22:49,651 --> 01:22:51,736
Or are you tidying up?

1103
01:22:52,070 --> 01:22:53,905
Don't hold your breath.

1104
01:22:56,199 --> 01:22:57,867
What's wrong with you two?

1105
01:22:57,909 --> 01:23:01,955
Are you drunk? Or high?
You guys got high?

1106
01:23:02,455 --> 01:23:03,832
He's used to it.

1107
01:23:07,252 --> 01:23:09,921
I'll drive you. No more cabs.

1108
01:23:10,338 --> 01:23:11,631
- What?
- Here.

1109
01:23:11,673 --> 01:23:14,092
Already, now?

1110
01:23:14,134 --> 01:23:16,136
Didn't he say that?

1111
01:23:16,177 --> 01:23:18,096
No.

1112
01:23:18,138 --> 01:23:19,889
Louis, you're
staying tonight?

1113
01:23:19,931 --> 01:23:22,183
My bad! In the car, didn't you say

1114
01:23:22,225 --> 01:23:24,894
you had a meeting tonight?

1115
01:23:24,936 --> 01:23:26,604
Tonight, right?

1116
01:23:26,646 --> 01:23:28,148
Are you insane, Antoine?

1117
01:23:28,189 --> 01:23:30,191
I'm not insane, I listen.

1118
01:23:30,233 --> 01:23:33,778
He has to go,
so I kindly offer my help.

1119
01:23:33,820 --> 01:23:36,781
Airport's 40 minutes
from your mom's, right?

1120
01:23:36,823 --> 01:23:38,658
That's right, honey.

1121
01:23:38,700 --> 01:23:41,244
I'll grab the kids on my way.

1122
01:23:41,286 --> 01:23:44,706
Excuse me, how long to
the airport? 40 minutes?

1123
01:23:44,748 --> 01:23:46,041
When d'you last go?

1124
01:23:46,082 --> 01:23:47,751
You've never been!

1125
01:23:47,792 --> 01:23:51,171
I go all the time, idiot,
Julien lives there!

1126
01:23:51,212 --> 01:23:53,381
So? What's the difference?

1127
01:23:53,423 --> 01:23:55,842
He's not taking another cab!

1128
01:23:55,884 --> 01:23:58,219
That isn't the point, Antoine!

1129
01:23:58,637 --> 01:24:00,305
It is not the point!

1130
01:24:05,685 --> 01:24:07,520
Louis...

1131
01:24:07,562 --> 01:24:08,813
You're going?

1132
01:24:09,189 --> 01:24:12,400
I can drive you,
tonight, or tomorrow.

1133
01:24:12,442 --> 01:24:13,526
You sleep over,

1134
01:24:13,568 --> 01:24:15,320
we have breakfast.

1135
01:24:17,155 --> 01:24:18,531
What's that meeting?

1136
01:24:18,573 --> 01:24:20,575
Yes, what's that meeting?

1137
01:24:20,617 --> 01:24:22,869
Is it that important?

1138
01:24:25,288 --> 01:24:26,790
It can't wait?

1139
01:24:28,458 --> 01:24:31,586
On a Sunday, I mean...

1140
01:24:33,546 --> 01:24:35,548
You said it was crucial.

1141
01:24:35,590 --> 01:24:37,092
Shut up!

1142
01:24:44,766 --> 01:24:46,685
What's the problem, here?

1143
01:24:47,769 --> 01:24:49,938
We were doing fine!

1144
01:24:50,814 --> 01:24:52,691
In a moment, pow!

1145
01:24:53,733 --> 01:24:55,568
Why, Louis?

1146
01:24:56,987 --> 01:24:57,988
Why?

1147
01:25:06,871 --> 01:25:08,623
Because.

1148
01:25:10,542 --> 01:25:11,960
I have a meeting.

1149
01:25:13,086 --> 01:25:14,796
Thank you. Let's go.

1150
01:25:14,838 --> 01:25:17,716
What the fuck, Antoine!
Don't touch him!

1151
01:25:31,229 --> 01:25:32,480
What's wrong?

1152
01:25:33,148 --> 01:25:35,900
- Antoine, I'm fine!
- Just helping...

1153
01:25:35,942 --> 01:25:40,030
What the hell's going on!
This is pure madness!

1154
01:25:40,071 --> 01:25:42,699
No! He'll miss his plane.

1155
01:25:42,741 --> 01:25:47,579
- We can at least kiss goodbye.
- Now! Kiss kiss, chop chop!

1156
01:25:47,620 --> 01:25:49,998
Only two seconds ago we were...

1157
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:51,750
eating nicely,

1158
01:25:51,791 --> 01:25:54,294
speaking happily, sharing a moment

1159
01:25:54,336 --> 01:25:56,254
and you just act up,

1160
01:25:56,296 --> 01:25:58,923
breaking, spoiling
every bit of it!

1161
01:25:58,965 --> 01:26:00,800
I'm warning you,

1162
01:26:00,842 --> 01:26:02,218
I won't forget this.

1163
01:26:02,719 --> 01:26:05,221
Your brother was trying...
I don't get it.

1164
01:26:05,263 --> 01:26:07,182
- It's okay, Mom.
- Kissy, kissy, come on!

1165
01:26:07,223 --> 01:26:08,600
- Antoine...
- Shut up!

1166
01:26:08,642 --> 01:26:12,270
Jesus! I'll drive him!
Louis, let me take you!

1167
01:26:12,312 --> 01:26:13,772
Suzanne, stop!

1168
01:26:13,813 --> 01:26:15,565
I'm driving him!

1169
01:26:15,607 --> 01:26:19,319
- We can't drive like a...
- Like what? Say it!

1170
01:26:20,612 --> 01:26:23,698
I'm driving him! The end!
I'll be back in an hour.

1171
01:26:23,740 --> 01:26:25,700
- You're so despicable!
- Me?

1172
01:26:25,742 --> 01:26:28,870
You don't hear yourself!
See yourself!

1173
01:26:28,912 --> 01:26:31,915
How you rush him!
How you talk to me!

1174
01:26:31,956 --> 01:26:33,500
And your wife!

1175
01:26:35,168 --> 01:26:36,670
You...

1176
01:26:36,711 --> 01:26:38,838
you little piece of shit.

1177
01:26:40,006 --> 01:26:43,426
- Come on, defend me!
- Of course she will!

1178
01:26:43,468 --> 01:26:45,095
Suzanne?

1179
01:26:46,304 --> 01:26:47,889
I don't get it.

1180
01:26:49,432 --> 01:26:51,017
So I'll come visit?

1181
01:26:58,441 --> 01:26:59,901
Let's go, Louis.

1182
01:27:00,443 --> 01:27:01,653
Louis!

1183
01:27:05,115 --> 01:27:06,116
See you soon.

1184
01:27:06,866 --> 01:27:09,494
Let him go, you fucking psycho!

1185
01:27:09,536 --> 01:27:10,829
What did I do?

1186
01:27:11,287 --> 01:27:12,789
What you do is,

1187
01:27:12,831 --> 01:27:17,210
you ruin our fucking lives
and our day with Louis

1188
01:27:17,252 --> 01:27:19,087
with your brutality!

1189
01:27:19,129 --> 01:27:21,339
Brutality? My... Me?

1190
01:27:21,756 --> 01:27:23,300
Yes, you!

1191
01:27:23,341 --> 01:27:25,927
- Antoine.
- Stop, I'm fine!

1192
01:27:25,969 --> 01:27:28,680
Calm down.
It's okay, just...

1193
01:27:28,722 --> 01:27:31,516
Calm us... Calm yourself.

1194
01:27:32,225 --> 01:27:33,935
Don't be so brutal.

1195
01:27:33,977 --> 01:27:37,188
Who's brutal? I'm trying to help!

1196
01:27:37,230 --> 01:27:39,441
You weren't brutal,
it's a misunder...

1197
01:27:39,482 --> 01:27:42,694
- You! Goodness incarnate...
- Brutal and stupid!

1198
01:27:45,655 --> 01:27:49,909
You understand shit!
You know shit!

1199
01:27:49,951 --> 01:27:51,828
So shut your mouth, bitch!

1200
01:27:51,870 --> 01:27:55,665
Don't ever talk to
your sister like that!

1201
01:27:55,707 --> 01:27:59,002
Fine! Y'know what?
You figure it out.

1202
01:27:59,044 --> 01:28:01,713
I screwed up, as usual.

1203
01:28:01,755 --> 01:28:04,424
So go for it, Louis.
Go for it!

1204
01:28:04,466 --> 01:28:05,717
Go!

1205
01:28:08,845 --> 01:28:13,266
He said "I must go."
Those very words!

1206
01:28:13,308 --> 01:28:17,062
Is it my fucking fault again?

1207
01:28:17,103 --> 01:28:18,438
Is it?

1208
01:28:19,856 --> 01:28:24,152
You guys think I'm an idiot!
And I've had it!

1209
01:28:24,527 --> 01:28:27,614
There was nothing bad
in what I did!

1210
01:28:27,864 --> 01:28:28,865
Let's go.

1211
01:28:31,910 --> 01:28:36,665
It's not fair! You treat me
like I'm a circus freak!

1212
01:28:38,041 --> 01:28:39,584
It's not fair.

1213
01:28:39,626 --> 01:28:44,798
You've no right! You can't always
win! You can't do that to me!

1214
01:28:47,342 --> 01:28:48,843
Don't cry, Antoine...

1215
01:28:48,885 --> 01:28:49,970
I'll kill you!

1216
01:28:50,011 --> 01:28:51,304
Antoine, no!

1217
01:28:57,018 --> 01:28:58,895
Don't touch him, Louis.

1218
01:29:00,772 --> 01:29:02,565
Come. Don't.

1219
01:29:02,899 --> 01:29:05,318
Stop it. Get away from him.

1220
01:29:09,739 --> 01:29:11,032
Antoine, it's over.

1221
01:29:12,492 --> 01:29:13,618
Come.

1222
01:29:19,666 --> 01:29:20,667
It's over.

1223
01:29:49,696 --> 01:29:52,282
We'll be better prepared
next time.

1224
