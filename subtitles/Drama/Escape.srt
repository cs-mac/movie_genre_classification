1
00:01:43,647 --> 00:01:45,184
Nurse...

2
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:47,822
Do you know what day it's to be?

3
00:01:48,014 --> 00:01:51,527
All I know is we got to get you
up and walking by next Saturday.

4
00:01:52,354 --> 00:01:53,640
Wake up!

5
00:01:59,683 --> 00:02:01,499
Eat your soup while it's hot.

6
00:02:02,954 --> 00:02:04,013
I can't.

7
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:08,334
- I'll feed you.
- No, no, please. They'll punish you.

8
00:02:09,725 --> 00:02:12,542
Even they have humor
enough not to try that.

9
00:02:25,581 --> 00:02:27,634
Who gave you permission to walk?

10
00:02:28,009 --> 00:02:31,982
I'm rehearsing.
Permit an actress the luxury.

11
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:35,628
Rehearsals are very important.

12
00:02:35,872 --> 00:02:38,396
I have to know the kind
of spectacle I am making.

13
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:40,775
Stop talking!
Get back into bed.

14
00:02:43,725 --> 00:02:45,622
Will my audience cry?

15
00:02:46,758 --> 00:02:51,183
Or will they yawn and say,
"Oh, this was a bad performance.

16
00:02:51,203 --> 00:02:54,269
Now, the day we burned the
synagogue was much more fun.

17
00:02:54,289 --> 00:02:56,914
And the day we threw the
Archbishop through the window,

18
00:02:56,934 --> 00:02:58,698
we had a better show."

19
00:02:59,703 --> 00:03:01,289
You may go now.

20
00:03:01,309 --> 00:03:04,868
- I'll shut her mouth for good.
- I said, go!

21
00:03:11,444 --> 00:03:12,543
Nurse!

22
00:03:13,888 --> 00:03:16,287
Put her in the next room for treatment.

23
00:03:27,436 --> 00:03:29,257
Don't do that sort of thing.

24
00:03:29,952 --> 00:03:32,058
You'll just get hurt needlessly.

25
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:33,766
You operated on me.

26
00:03:34,846 --> 00:03:37,710
You saved me to be hurt, didn't you?

27
00:03:38,042 --> 00:03:40,026
I operated in the line of duty.

28
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,915
Now you have a new duty?

29
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:47,237
To save me from being hurt by
anyone, but the executioner?

30
00:03:47,453 --> 00:03:49,462
I never imagined you would be...

31
00:03:49,997 --> 00:03:51,950
- as you are.
- What's that?

32
00:03:56,627 --> 00:04:00,662
I'm going to say something I've...
I've wanted to say.

33
00:04:01,558 --> 00:04:04,037
Long before you came here,
I knew all about you.

34
00:04:04,057 --> 00:04:07,853
That is why it was such a great shock
for me to go into the operating room...

35
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:10,723
and see that it was Emmy
Ritter I was to save.

36
00:04:12,067 --> 00:04:15,094
- And yet not save at all.
- Then why did you?

37
00:04:16,534 --> 00:04:19,371
When I was a boy, I
lived in the country.

38
00:04:19,971 --> 00:04:22,814
I never saw a theater or went anywhere.

39
00:04:23,256 --> 00:04:26,250
And one day my father
went to the city...

40
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:30,396
and brought back a theater program
with your photograph on it.

41
00:04:31,978 --> 00:04:35,697
I stole it.
I kept it hidden in a bureau drawer.

42
00:04:37,179 --> 00:04:39,688
Many young boys fell in love with me.

43
00:04:40,557 --> 00:04:43,189
Ooh, many old ones too.

44
00:04:43,842 --> 00:04:47,203
In the photograph you are
dressed as Saint Elizabeth...

45
00:04:47,395 --> 00:04:52,159
carrying a basket with loaves of
bread, and in your arms, roses.

46
00:04:52,179 --> 00:04:55,333
- I remember.
- That's why you were important to me.

47
00:04:56,501 --> 00:05:00,971
In my hungry empty world
you promised so much.

48
00:05:01,224 --> 00:05:07,613
Bread for the hunger and
roses for the emptiness.

49
00:05:08,989 --> 00:05:12,118
And now I suppose you have a new
picture in your bureau drawer.

50
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,889
A new saviour of your world.

51
00:05:16,072 --> 00:05:19,774
- But his arms are full of guns.
- Why not?

52
00:05:20,234 --> 00:05:21,792
Power is the only answer.

53
00:05:22,975 --> 00:05:24,797
It's the only chance of survival.

54
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,942
Guns and blood.

55
00:05:28,618 --> 00:05:31,942
A river of blood to
blot out all hopes...

56
00:05:32,214 --> 00:05:34,235
for a decent future.

57
00:05:36,188 --> 00:05:38,623
Is survival worth that price?

58
00:05:39,534 --> 00:05:42,570
Our children will thank us for the
world we are making for them.

59
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,255
Thank you?

60
00:05:46,311 --> 00:05:48,396
Thank you for what?

61
00:05:49,302 --> 00:05:52,579
For a world filled with
the seed of new hates?

62
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,960
For a world in ruins?

63
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:01,652
If that's what your new
saviour can bring...

64
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:07,443
No thank you. I don't want it
for myself or my children.

65
00:06:11,377 --> 00:06:12,776
My children...

66
00:06:33,035 --> 00:06:35,335
I've been wondering if you...

67
00:06:35,355 --> 00:06:38,228
if you would like to send
some word to your family.

68
00:06:41,846 --> 00:06:45,587
I'm asking you if you would like
to write a letter to your family?

69
00:06:49,697 --> 00:06:50,833
Yes.

70
00:06:57,389 --> 00:06:59,003
You, ah...

71
00:06:59,023 --> 00:07:02,544
You understand, of course, that I'll
only be able to send the letter...

72
00:07:04,159 --> 00:07:05,361
afterward.

73
00:07:18,098 --> 00:07:19,666
Your passports, please.

74
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:24,925
- Have you any money to declare?
- Yes, about 600 dollars.

75
00:07:24,963 --> 00:07:26,747
You'll permit me to examine it.

76
00:07:31,957 --> 00:07:33,582
Please, your passport.

77
00:07:35,932 --> 00:07:36,889
Understand.

78
00:07:36,909 --> 00:07:39,543
You can't take any more money out
of the country than you bring in.

79
00:07:39,563 --> 00:07:42,026
It's the law!
Heil Hitler!

80
00:07:47,024 --> 00:07:48,010
Thank you, sir.

81
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:50,687
Say, can you tell me if a certain person
was registered here about four weeks ago?

82
00:07:50,707 --> 00:07:52,637
Yes, certainly, sir.
What was the name, sir?

83
00:07:52,657 --> 00:07:54,066
Madame Ritter.
Emmy Ritter.

84
00:07:54,086 --> 00:07:56,817
Yes, sir. Madame Ritter.
Just a moment, please.

85
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:04,648
Yes, sir. A Madame Ritter was our guest
for four days last month. She...

86
00:08:06,078 --> 00:08:08,999
Well, where did she go from here?
What forwarding address did she leave?

87
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:11,299
We have no record of that, sir.

88
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:13,750
Look, here's a letter I addressed
to her in care of this hotel.

89
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:16,651
It came back stamped address unknown.
How do I find out where she went?

90
00:08:16,671 --> 00:08:20,138
We have no record of that.
I don't know how you could find out.

91
00:08:20,572 --> 00:08:22,150
Could I help you, sir?

92
00:08:29,903 --> 00:08:34,945
I told you on the telephone.
He's been very ill. He sees no one.

93
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,245
- I must see him.
- I'm sorry.

94
00:08:37,265 --> 00:08:38,905
Wait. Please listen to me.

95
00:08:38,925 --> 00:08:41,315
Tell him it's a client from America.

96
00:08:43,874 --> 00:08:45,093
America?

97
00:08:45,113 --> 00:08:48,719
Yes, I've traveled 3000 miles to see him.
At least tell him I'm here.

98
00:08:51,511 --> 00:08:54,328
- Come in.
- Thank you.

99
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:58,067
Good evening, sir.

100
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,875
I want to apologize for insisting
upon seeing you, but...

101
00:09:00,895 --> 00:09:02,828
believe me, it's most important.

102
00:09:03,587 --> 00:09:05,587
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

103
00:09:06,188 --> 00:09:09,235
It's just that I'm in trouble, or I
wouldn't have been so insistent.

104
00:09:09,255 --> 00:09:11,751
I'm used to people in trouble.

105
00:09:11,771 --> 00:09:14,156
You see, it's my mother, Emmy Ritter.

106
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,893
Emmy Ritter.

107
00:09:16,382 --> 00:09:17,691
You know her?

108
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:21,367
Slightly.
Many years ago.

109
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:24,363
Then perhaps you know she's been
living in America for a long time.

110
00:09:24,383 --> 00:09:26,635
My father died and my
mother needed money so...

111
00:09:26,655 --> 00:09:29,577
she came back here several months
ago, sold her house and...

112
00:09:29,597 --> 00:09:32,077
I believe got in some sort of
trouble over the transaction.

113
00:09:32,097 --> 00:09:35,047
She has been arrested?

114
00:09:35,748 --> 00:09:38,872
I'm not sure.
I can't seem to find out anything.

115
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,087
I don't even know where to start.

116
00:09:41,683 --> 00:09:44,340
This is the last address
she gave me, but...

117
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,275
all the letters came back
stamped address unknown.

118
00:09:51,156 --> 00:09:53,408
I thought perhaps you
could help me find out...

119
00:09:53,428 --> 00:09:55,006
Wait...

120
00:09:55,447 --> 00:09:59,278
Your mother, is she
an American citizen?

121
00:09:59,414 --> 00:10:02,190
No, sir. I am, and my sister is.
We were born in America...

122
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,375
but my mother,

123
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:05,694
well she always talked about
taking out citizenship papers

124
00:10:05,714 --> 00:10:08,093
but she kept putting it off, just
like she did everything else.

125
00:10:08,113 --> 00:10:11,888
In other words, she's still
a citizen of this country.

126
00:10:12,414 --> 00:10:14,620
And subject to our laws.

127
00:10:14,763 --> 00:10:17,365
Yes, sir, but whatever she did...

128
00:10:17,385 --> 00:10:20,229
Well, a woman doesn't understand
much about exchange laws...

129
00:10:20,249 --> 00:10:22,945
and all that sort of thing,
especially an actress like my mother.

130
00:10:23,595 --> 00:10:25,884
She was always forgetting
things, or losing things...

131
00:10:25,904 --> 00:10:27,134
Ya, ya...

132
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:32,511
She must have taken a small
token sum for her house...

133
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:39,073
and contrived to have the rest
deposited to her credit in New York.

134
00:10:40,117 --> 00:10:44,533
Oh, that's quite enough to be tried
before the people's court...

135
00:10:46,147 --> 00:10:48,542
- for treason.
- Treason?

136
00:10:48,562 --> 00:10:51,720
Ya...the word doesn't
mean much to you?

137
00:10:52,178 --> 00:10:55,108
I've seen it in history books, but
what's it got to do with my mother?

138
00:10:55,128 --> 00:10:57,239
A great deal, perhaps.

139
00:10:58,197 --> 00:11:01,127
There may be a death penalty.

140
00:11:03,057 --> 00:11:08,090
- For selling a house?
- I'm serious, young man.

141
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:12,872
The sentence is not
necessarily death...

142
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:17,823
and even if it is, it is not
necessarily carried out.

143
00:11:18,996 --> 00:11:22,424
But the possibility is always there...

144
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:27,376
- for death penalty.
- Stop saying that, will you.

145
00:11:29,742 --> 00:11:31,070
My mother...

146
00:11:32,696 --> 00:11:35,832
My mother... what's she got to do with death?
Why, she's life.

147
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:39,209
You say you knew her, once.
Remember, there's life in everything she does.

148
00:11:39,229 --> 00:11:42,411
The way she walks and talks, and
even when she's just standing still

149
00:11:42,431 --> 00:11:44,996
and just looking at you she's
the livest person in the world.

150
00:11:45,118 --> 00:11:46,996
What's she got to do with death?

151
00:11:53,288 --> 00:11:54,725
I'm sorry, I....

152
00:11:55,654 --> 00:11:59,169
I've been so worried about her, I
guess I'm a little goofy, that's all.

153
00:12:00,865 --> 00:12:03,869
Mr Henning, what can you do for me?

154
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:07,635
I?
I am a sick man.

155
00:12:08,187 --> 00:12:10,873
There is nothing I can do for you.

156
00:12:12,197 --> 00:12:20,067
Nothing, except to advise you to
return to America as soon as possible!

157
00:12:20,217 --> 00:12:23,382
Don't you understand yet?
This is my mother, I've got to do something.

158
00:12:23,402 --> 00:12:26,885
Yes, yes, I suppose so.
But in the end, you have to give up!

159
00:12:27,478 --> 00:12:30,238
But a good lawyer..
They said you were the best.

160
00:12:30,258 --> 00:12:35,125
Mr Preysing, this is
not the United States!

161
00:12:35,317 --> 00:12:42,785
How long do you suppose I'd be allowed to
go on living here if I handled such cases?

162
00:12:42,805 --> 00:12:45,545
Are you telling me there's
nothing I can do in a legal way?

163
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:49,113
Nothing.
Go back to America.

164
00:12:49,395 --> 00:12:51,589
But I've got to know something.
What her sentence is,

165
00:12:51,609 --> 00:12:53,833
where's she's being kept.
At least I've got to know that.

166
00:12:54,021 --> 00:12:56,410
- You know. You must...
- I know nothing.

167
00:12:56,903 --> 00:12:59,007
Those trials are secret.

168
00:12:59,274 --> 00:13:00,985
I'd know nothing.

169
00:13:01,005 --> 00:13:02,779
You do!
You're afraid to tell me.

170
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:05,166
- Well, you will tell me!
- Please!

171
00:13:09,512 --> 00:13:12,964
I had heard you were an
exceptionally courageous man.

172
00:13:13,895 --> 00:13:15,679
I'm sorry I troubled you.

173
00:13:17,444 --> 00:13:20,808
Mr Preysing!
Mr Preysing!

174
00:13:21,139 --> 00:13:23,083
Maybe you should go to...

175
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,566
to the Commissioner of Police.

176
00:13:46,383 --> 00:13:48,702
Did you hear him?

177
00:13:50,741 --> 00:14:00,187
"I heard you were an exceptionally
courageous man, Mr Henning."

178
00:14:05,951 --> 00:14:09,022
Mr Preysing, the Commissioner
will see you now.

179
00:14:18,378 --> 00:14:19,570
Come in.

180
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,360
Sit down.

181
00:14:29,924 --> 00:14:33,969
- My name is...
- Ah, yes, your name is Mark Preysing.

182
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:38,185
And you are an American citizen
and you are also a painter.

183
00:14:38,205 --> 00:14:41,334
A very promising one, I understand.

184
00:14:41,704 --> 00:14:43,859
You seem to know a lot
about me, Mr Commissioner.

185
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:47,653
I do hope you'll find time to do
some painting in our country.

186
00:14:48,198 --> 00:14:50,508
Art has many forms, has it not?

187
00:14:50,727 --> 00:14:52,567
For instance, the theater...

188
00:14:52,587 --> 00:14:54,501
It is one of my great regrets

189
00:14:54,521 --> 00:14:58,240
that I never saw your mother,
Madame Ritter, on the stage.

190
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,686
It's my mother I've come to you about.

191
00:15:00,838 --> 00:15:02,153
Ah, yes indeed.

192
00:15:03,533 --> 00:15:07,539
- Then she has been arrested.
- Your mother, Mr Preysing...

193
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:09,992
has a very sympathetic nature.

194
00:15:10,529 --> 00:15:14,016
I have here a record of her
activities in America.

195
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:19,728
She had a charming custom of harboring
renegade citizens of this country.

196
00:15:19,748 --> 00:15:23,102
She helped out people that she knew,
people who were in trouble... refugees...

197
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:26,801
We do not like the word refugee.
We prefer traitor.

198
00:15:27,158 --> 00:15:29,675
My mother knew nothing about
international politics.

199
00:15:29,787 --> 00:15:33,850
She has the mind of an artist. She sees people
as a general humanity, not as separate races.

200
00:15:34,154 --> 00:15:37,146
Mr Commissioner, believe me, my mother's
done no harm in her whole life.

201
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:39,037
And she's done more good
than most of us have.

202
00:15:39,057 --> 00:15:41,987
Good for whom?
For the enemies of our state?

203
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:44,096
State, state!
How about human beings?

204
00:15:44,116 --> 00:15:45,425
Mr Preysing!

205
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:51,974
I am not concerned with
your mother, believe me.

206
00:15:53,532 --> 00:15:55,504
I saw you for one reason...

207
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:58,134
and one reason alone.

208
00:15:58,782 --> 00:16:01,580
The fact that the woman was in trouble.
How did you find that out?

209
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,598
The trial was secret.

210
00:16:02,618 --> 00:16:03,847
Who gave you your information?

211
00:16:03,867 --> 00:16:05,383
I thought it was your
business to know everything.

212
00:16:05,403 --> 00:16:08,307
So, you do not choose to tell me.

213
00:16:08,327 --> 00:16:09,622
Very well...

214
00:16:10,044 --> 00:16:12,310
In the most friendly way, therefore,

215
00:16:12,789 --> 00:16:14,967
I must advise you to go home.

216
00:16:18,506 --> 00:16:21,727
Mr Commissioner, if you'd just
see my mother, talk to her...

217
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:25,154
you'd realize she couldn't possibly be a criminal.
She's just a simple ordinary woman.

218
00:16:25,304 --> 00:16:27,874
I'm afraid I must ask you to go now.

219
00:16:28,337 --> 00:16:30,891
If I can't see her, at
least let me write to her.

220
00:16:30,911 --> 00:16:35,374
Yes, yes, I shall have to
make the necessary inquiries.

221
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:37,928
-When?
- I don't know.

222
00:16:37,948 --> 00:16:41,646
Monday.
Yes, come next Monday.

223
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,752
No, perhaps Friday would be better.

224
00:16:43,977 --> 00:16:47,254
But that's such a long time to wait.
Couldn't I possibly...

225
00:17:06,341 --> 00:17:10,347
So, you are enjoying our town, sir.

226
00:17:10,498 --> 00:17:13,925
Yeah, sure. You really ought
to call it The Friendly City.

227
00:17:13,945 --> 00:17:14,986
Yes, sir.

228
00:17:15,381 --> 00:17:16,639
Mr Preysing?

229
00:17:16,892 --> 00:17:18,902
- Well?
- I didn't want to trouble you, sir...

230
00:17:18,922 --> 00:17:21,803
but I found out what you wanted to know.
This letter you gave me...

231
00:17:21,823 --> 00:17:25,402
The postmark, see?
The postman thinks it's from Felzenkirche.

232
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:29,542
- Where's that?
- Two hours by train. In the mountains.

233
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:34,844
- All right. Get me a ticket on the first train.
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

234
00:17:35,234 --> 00:17:38,962
Oh, Felzenkirche.
That's a beautiful place.

235
00:17:39,585 --> 00:17:41,857
They say it's still winter up there.

236
00:17:42,013 --> 00:17:43,613
Ice, snow...

237
00:17:44,515 --> 00:17:48,017
Wonderful view of the Alps
there, near the border.

238
00:17:50,459 --> 00:17:51,661
Border, eh?

239
00:17:52,355 --> 00:17:56,571
Any restricted areas?
Concentration camps?

240
00:17:58,046 --> 00:18:00,562
You shouldn't believe
everything you hear, sir.

241
00:18:00,891 --> 00:18:03,060
Or anything I see, either?

242
00:18:12,019 --> 00:18:13,565
Finish your drink, sir.

243
00:18:14,106 --> 00:18:18,010
No, thanks. I've had enough.
I've had plenty of everything.

244
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,767
I've had it up to here!

245
00:18:41,565 --> 00:18:42,559
What do you want?

246
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:44,027
- Are you Helda Keller?
- Yes.

247
00:18:44,047 --> 00:18:45,672
Where can I find your brother, Fritz?

248
00:18:45,692 --> 00:18:47,860
He is not in.
Why do you want to see him?

249
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,820
- We were friends in America.
- So?

250
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,068
Yes, Fritz was working for
my mother, Emmy Ritter.

251
00:18:52,088 --> 00:18:53,307
No, you better stay away from here.

252
00:18:53,327 --> 00:18:54,439
But wait, let me explain.

253
00:18:54,459 --> 00:18:56,565
No, you better get away from here!
Go away!

254
00:19:18,736 --> 00:19:19,731
Coffee.

255
00:19:21,229 --> 00:19:22,360
Yes, sir.

256
00:19:25,445 --> 00:19:27,802
Most Americans like our beer, sir.

257
00:19:27,999 --> 00:19:31,417
I'm collecting reasons why people
think I'm American. What's yours?

258
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,711
It's your coat, sir.

259
00:19:34,322 --> 00:19:36,514
We don't get such fine
woolens here anymore.

260
00:19:36,534 --> 00:19:40,664
Except for the Army and a few others.

261
00:19:40,937 --> 00:19:42,664
But, of course, that
is as it should be.

262
00:19:42,684 --> 00:19:44,086
Oh, sure, sure.

263
00:19:44,899 --> 00:19:45,885
Keep it.

264
00:19:47,744 --> 00:19:49,361
Thank you, sir.

265
00:19:50,762 --> 00:19:52,847
Fritz Keller is a fine
fellow, isn't he?

266
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:53,981
Fritz Keller?

267
00:19:54,001 --> 00:19:55,974
Yes, I used to know him in America.

268
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:57,568
I'm on my way to his house now.

269
00:19:57,588 --> 00:20:00,382
Oh, no, sir. You won't find
him home this hour of day.

270
00:20:00,402 --> 00:20:02,752
He hauls wood down from the mountain.

271
00:20:02,772 --> 00:20:04,905
Comes along the road
there every afternoon.

272
00:20:04,925 --> 00:20:06,759
You'll be sure to catch
him if you wait here.

273
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:08,245
Thanks, I will.

274
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:10,733
Thanks again, sir.

275
00:20:17,792 --> 00:20:20,102
- Watch us, Countess.
- Now you watch us.

276
00:20:37,752 --> 00:20:39,673
That was all I needed.

277
00:20:42,954 --> 00:20:45,771
Oh, I'm sorry.
You didn't hurt yourself, did you?

278
00:20:46,832 --> 00:20:48,400
Only my dignity.

279
00:20:49,656 --> 00:20:51,403
I couldn't help laughing.

280
00:20:51,506 --> 00:20:53,516
Don't apologize.
It was a pleasure.

281
00:20:53,536 --> 00:20:56,482
- Shall I do it again?
- Oh, no, no. No, please.

282
00:20:56,502 --> 00:21:00,362
Don't worry. I was only what
we Americans call kidding.

283
00:21:00,516 --> 00:21:05,151
- Oh, really? What do you call it?
- Kidding. Like if I say, I ah...

284
00:21:05,171 --> 00:21:08,403
I love your beautiful country.
I'm kidding.

285
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:10,547
I see.

286
00:21:11,147 --> 00:21:12,480
But, if I say...

287
00:21:12,931 --> 00:21:17,437
May I sit down? Because you seem
awfully nice and friendly...

288
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:19,315
and I'm not kidding.

289
00:21:24,425 --> 00:21:28,585
So you're an American.
Tell me, do you have Indian blood?

290
00:21:29,111 --> 00:21:31,392
- Indian blood?
- Or are you a cowboy?

291
00:21:31,412 --> 00:21:34,265
I love those cowboy songs.
Did you bring your ukulele?

292
00:21:34,428 --> 00:21:37,836
Look, lady, there are other people in
America besides Indians and cowboys.

293
00:21:37,856 --> 00:21:40,024
Oh, then you're a hillbilly.

294
00:21:40,044 --> 00:21:42,437
Yeah, that's right.
From 57th street.

295
00:21:42,457 --> 00:21:44,275
- West or east?
- West.

296
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,488
- Why?
- I was born on east 57.

297
00:21:50,268 --> 00:21:54,099
- Well, for the love of... honest?
- Cross my heart.

298
00:21:55,545 --> 00:21:58,109
But those girls called you countess.
Do you live around here?

299
00:21:58,129 --> 00:22:01,386
I've lived here for many years.
Ever since my husband died.

300
00:22:01,406 --> 00:22:03,399
- He was a native of this country?
- Yes.

301
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:05,324
Why don't you come back home?

302
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:08,375
Home?
This is my home.

303
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:10,936
Don't you want to go back?

304
00:22:11,077 --> 00:22:12,627
I did go back, but...

305
00:22:12,649 --> 00:22:16,138
all my relatives were scattered, and
my friends and I had grown apart.

306
00:22:16,696 --> 00:22:18,753
There was nothing there for me.

307
00:22:19,013 --> 00:22:21,173
Everything I care about is here.

308
00:22:22,018 --> 00:22:24,315
Look, Countess, maybe you can help me.

309
00:22:25,431 --> 00:22:27,336
Come on, let's get
something hot to drink.

310
00:22:27,356 --> 00:22:29,826
Oh, thank you, but I must
keep an eye on my girls.

311
00:22:31,037 --> 00:22:33,489
- Your girls?
- My pupils.

312
00:22:33,509 --> 00:22:34,408
Oh, I see.

313
00:22:34,428 --> 00:22:37,696
After my husband died, I turned our
house into a finishing school.

314
00:22:37,871 --> 00:22:39,363
My name is Mark Preysing.

315
00:22:39,383 --> 00:22:41,073
Preysing?
That's a familiar name over here.

316
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:42,895
Both my parents were
born in this country.

317
00:22:42,915 --> 00:22:45,486
My father's dead.
My mother is...

318
00:22:45,811 --> 00:22:47,726
- Emmy Ritter.
- The actress?

319
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,086
I saw her once in Vienna.
She was a very great artist.

320
00:22:51,106 --> 00:22:53,050
Has she come back here to live?

321
00:22:53,753 --> 00:22:56,289
I don't know.
Perhaps to die.

322
00:22:57,162 --> 00:22:58,730
I am sorry, but..

323
00:22:59,697 --> 00:23:02,075
But perhaps in this climate...

324
00:23:02,415 --> 00:23:05,213
I'd like so much to meet her.
Where is she staying?

325
00:23:05,457 --> 00:23:08,245
I'm afraid you'll have to
ask the political police.

326
00:23:08,468 --> 00:23:11,062
It's like a nightmare.
I can't find out anything.

327
00:23:11,322 --> 00:23:14,177
I came up here to meet an old servant
of my mother's. He sent me a letter.

328
00:23:14,197 --> 00:23:16,908
Please, Mr Preysing.
I'd rather you didn't go on.

329
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,700
What are you afraid of?

330
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,415
Believe me, you have my
deepest sympathy, but...

331
00:23:24,025 --> 00:23:25,800
But you don't want to listen.

332
00:23:26,117 --> 00:23:27,394
Nobody does.

333
00:23:28,521 --> 00:23:31,769
This place isn't a country.
It's a Coney Island madhouse.

334
00:23:31,789 --> 00:23:34,032
Everything looks like a door
until you try to go through it.

335
00:23:34,052 --> 00:23:36,122
Every person looks like a
human being until you try to

336
00:23:36,142 --> 00:23:38,287
talk to him, then something
squirts in your eye.

337
00:23:38,307 --> 00:23:43,321
It isn't that I don't want to listen,
but what can I do? How can I help?

338
00:23:43,649 --> 00:23:48,399
I'm nobody. I'm a schoolmistress, I live
a very retired life, I have no contacts.

339
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:52,701
- But I thought that being an American...
- I'm legally a citizen of this country.

340
00:23:53,212 --> 00:23:55,706
Legally, but not in your heart.

341
00:23:58,329 --> 00:24:01,662
If I may say so, Mr Preysing, you don't
know anything about this country,

342
00:24:01,682 --> 00:24:03,248
I know all I want to.

343
00:24:04,006 --> 00:24:06,739
Especially, you don't know how
I feel about this country.

344
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,044
If I may say so, Countess,

345
00:24:10,242 --> 00:24:12,975
I'm afraid you're just selling
yourself a bill of goods.

346
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:17,879
Shall we just leave that undecided?

347
00:24:19,415 --> 00:24:22,701
I really must go. My girls will
skate all night if I let them.

348
00:24:23,941 --> 00:24:24,766
I...

349
00:24:25,987 --> 00:24:29,847
I do hope that you find things
not as bad as you believe.

350
00:24:31,395 --> 00:24:35,132
Forgive me for being so rude, but
I've been terribly concerned.

351
00:24:35,385 --> 00:24:38,836
And if by any chance I have the
opportunity to inquire, I...

352
00:24:38,856 --> 00:24:39,880
Yes?

353
00:24:40,255 --> 00:24:41,119
My...

354
00:24:41,448 --> 00:24:44,424
My house is up there, near
the pass, the green one...

355
00:24:45,149 --> 00:24:46,191
I just remembered,

356
00:24:46,211 --> 00:24:48,848
- we're leaving for town tomorrow.
- Well, so am I.

357
00:24:48,989 --> 00:24:52,717
- Are you? Where are you staying?
- At the Excelsior.

358
00:24:53,572 --> 00:24:56,473
- Well, I'll call you.
- That'll be swell.

359
00:24:58,653 --> 00:25:00,914
It's been good having
someone to talk to.

360
00:25:01,027 --> 00:25:03,807
I'm sure you'll help me, if you can.

361
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:07,901
Goodbye.

362
00:25:08,239 --> 00:25:09,403
Goodbye.

363
00:25:17,761 --> 00:25:21,618
Ah, Mister!
Here comes Fritz Keller now.

364
00:25:28,865 --> 00:25:31,676
Fritz!
Fritz, wait a minute.

365
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:32,621
Fritz!

366
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:37,770
Frtiz!
Fritz, don't you know me?

367
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:43,002
Fritz, what's the matter with you?
I got the letter.

368
00:25:43,146 --> 00:25:46,402
Where is she? Just tell where she is.
I'll see you don't get in any trouble.

369
00:25:46,543 --> 00:25:49,407
I don't know what you
are talking about.

370
00:25:49,427 --> 00:25:51,548
Fritz, in heaven's name,
what are you up to?

371
00:25:51,568 --> 00:25:54,768
- You must want to help her.
- Get away from my horses.

372
00:25:54,872 --> 00:25:56,856
Fritz, listen. I'm going back
to town, the Hotel Excelsior.

373
00:25:56,876 --> 00:26:00,121
- If you find out anything...
- Get away from my horses!

374
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:14,727
I opened the door. I saw a long
table covered with food and wine.

375
00:26:14,747 --> 00:26:18,874
And there were 20 officers
sitting around it.

376
00:26:18,894 --> 00:26:19,950
The enemy!

377
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,680
But Excellency, what did you do?

378
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,309
Do? I said, I beg your
pardon, and shut the door.

379
00:26:30,857 --> 00:26:33,082
It doesn't seem to amuse you, Countess.

380
00:26:34,453 --> 00:26:36,118
I'm sorry, General.

381
00:26:36,138 --> 00:26:39,293
I don't blame you. You must have
heard it at least a dozen times.

382
00:26:40,567 --> 00:26:42,802
I could hear it a thousand times.

383
00:26:42,822 --> 00:26:46,795
- I could hear it a million times.
- But not tonight. And now to bed, girls.

384
00:26:46,815 --> 00:26:49,969
Oh, no. Countess, it's so early.
It's too early to sleep.

385
00:26:49,989 --> 00:26:50,976
Well, you'll have to try.

386
00:26:50,996 --> 00:26:53,173
Remember we must be back in
town before noon tomorrow.

387
00:26:53,193 --> 00:26:54,258
Now run along, girls.

388
00:26:54,278 --> 00:26:57,379
- Well, I must go too.
- Good night, General.

389
00:26:58,682 --> 00:27:01,313
- Good night, Your Excellency.
- Good night.

390
00:27:06,095 --> 00:27:08,311
Julie, my coat.

391
00:27:15,076 --> 00:27:17,630
- Good night, Countess.
- Good night, General.

392
00:27:19,639 --> 00:27:20,897
Thank you, Julie.

393
00:27:28,417 --> 00:27:29,891
There he goes.

394
00:27:32,744 --> 00:27:37,411
- He's a wonderful man.
- I think they're both wonderful.

395
00:27:37,552 --> 00:27:40,082
In love for years and years.

396
00:27:40,102 --> 00:27:43,426
I heard that he was the reason
why she came back from America.

397
00:27:43,446 --> 00:27:47,291
- Like something in a book.
- What kind of a book?

398
00:27:48,212 --> 00:27:52,458
- None they'd let us read.
- I don't think that's a bit funny.

399
00:27:53,286 --> 00:27:56,547
The only reason the General has
anything to do with her is...

400
00:27:56,887 --> 00:28:01,378
- is because he's lonely.
- Then why doesn't he join the Army?

401
00:28:02,103 --> 00:28:05,174
Oh, I hate you!
I hate all of you!

402
00:28:19,116 --> 00:28:21,337
Darling, it's been a long evening.

403
00:28:21,357 --> 00:28:24,436
Those children shouldn't be
allowed to stay up so late.

404
00:28:24,587 --> 00:28:25,944
Those children shouldn't be allowed to

405
00:28:25,964 --> 00:28:27,335
fall in love with a general who tells

406
00:28:27,355 --> 00:28:28,707
them such exciting stories.

407
00:28:28,727 --> 00:28:31,894
Oh, is that what you teach them?
That it is bad to fall in love with a general.

408
00:28:31,914 --> 00:28:35,675
- Of course, look at me.
- A horrible example indeed.

409
00:28:36,038 --> 00:28:38,207
I hope that the girls profit by it.

410
00:28:38,712 --> 00:28:41,039
They all have tremendous
crushes on you, Kurt.

411
00:28:41,059 --> 00:28:42,743
Why do you suppose that is?

412
00:28:43,213 --> 00:28:45,277
Perhaps because you
tell stories so well.

413
00:28:45,297 --> 00:28:47,938
So well that you have to turn
to your bookshelf for relief.

414
00:28:47,958 --> 00:28:51,929
Oh, while you were talking I just happened
to be reminded of some old memoirs.

415
00:28:51,949 --> 00:28:55,318
- Are my stories are so old as that?
- No.

416
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:01,376
- But I wonder if...
- The only memoirs that interest me began

417
00:29:01,396 --> 00:29:03,966
ten years ago in a certain
box at the opera.

418
00:29:03,986 --> 00:29:05,878
Perhaps you remember.

419
00:29:06,847 --> 00:29:10,077
- Tristan and Isolda.
- And you wore a red dress.

420
00:29:11,203 --> 00:29:13,963
Our memoirs should be
called Ten Years of Escape.

421
00:29:13,983 --> 00:29:15,534
- Escape?
- Yes...

422
00:29:16,229 --> 00:29:18,858
from an unbearably cruel
and miserable world.

423
00:29:19,825 --> 00:29:23,396
Kurt, I've been very lucky living
on my mountaintop above all that.

424
00:29:23,631 --> 00:29:26,626
Everyone should keep his
real self on a mountaintop.

425
00:29:28,509 --> 00:29:30,781
And yet there are those
who aren't so lucky.

426
00:29:31,072 --> 00:29:34,628
It isn't luck, my child.
It's the survival of the fittest.

427
00:29:35,126 --> 00:29:38,658
Kurt, are we so sure
who are the fittest?

428
00:29:40,024 --> 00:29:42,574
Can it be you don't
read our newspapers?

429
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:48,034
Fit or unfit?

430
00:29:51,988 --> 00:29:53,929
Emmy Ritter, yes.
I remember her.

431
00:29:53,949 --> 00:29:54,942
Bad tempered girl.

432
00:29:54,962 --> 00:29:55,660
Good legs.

433
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,111
Used to be very popular

434
00:29:57,131 --> 00:29:58,958
15 or 20 years ago.

435
00:29:58,978 --> 00:30:02,059
By the way, Stolbach is conducting
an all-Wagner concert Tuesday.

436
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:03,722
Kurt, do you know what became of her?

437
00:30:03,742 --> 00:30:08,127
Who? Oh, Emmy Ritter.
I think she went to America.

438
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:13,337
Darling, I'll take a box for the concert
if you think you can get a red dress.

439
00:30:14,249 --> 00:30:16,963
Somebody told me she was
somewhere here in this country.

440
00:30:17,282 --> 00:30:18,399
Is she?

441
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:20,652
Why should that interest us?

442
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:22,860
Kurt, won't you tell me what's
happened to Emmy Ritter?

443
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,272
- Why do you insist?
- I want to know.

444
00:30:25,766 --> 00:30:28,093
You're an unreasonable stubborn child,

445
00:30:28,113 --> 00:30:30,708
but if it amuses you to
indulge your curiosity...

446
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:35,114
Emmy Ritter's in a concentration
camp and is to be executed Saturday.

447
00:30:38,494 --> 00:30:40,041
Executed?

448
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:43,724
May we now consider the matter closed?

449
00:30:46,437 --> 00:30:50,221
- They're going to kill her? Why?
- I didn't say kill. I said execute.

450
00:30:50,241 --> 00:30:51,449
She's guilty of treason.

451
00:30:51,469 --> 00:30:53,281
Who found her guilty?
Those horrible people?

452
00:30:53,301 --> 00:30:54,474
That's enough!

453
00:30:57,334 --> 00:30:59,141
Kurt, you're defending them.

454
00:30:59,598 --> 00:31:00,669
You...

455
00:31:01,533 --> 00:31:05,129
A man with your name, your
honor, your integrity.

456
00:31:05,442 --> 00:31:07,560
I'm a soldier in the
service of the State.

457
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,698
And I tell you they have
found her guilty. Finished!

458
00:31:09,718 --> 00:31:12,591
They? You know what they are.
I know what you think of them.

459
00:31:13,477 --> 00:31:15,507
Or at least what you used
to think about them.

460
00:31:17,223 --> 00:31:20,255
But now I don't know.
You're becoming more like them and...

461
00:31:20,833 --> 00:31:22,959
I can't bear the change in you.

462
00:31:22,979 --> 00:31:26,476
I'm trying to tell you... I'm...
I'm trying to tell you...

463
00:31:27,171 --> 00:31:29,711
- Kurt, what is it?
- Nothing. Nothing.

464
00:31:29,981 --> 00:31:32,545
Kurt, please come sit down.

465
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:44,023
Oh, what a thoughtless fool I've been.
The doctor warned me that...
- Don't mind the doctor.

466
00:31:44,043 --> 00:31:45,576
- I'm all right.
- Are you sure?

467
00:31:45,596 --> 00:31:48,824
- Yes, I'm all right.
- I'm so sorry. I...

468
00:31:49,227 --> 00:31:51,193
I didn't mean to start all this.

469
00:31:51,213 --> 00:31:54,387
Poor Ruby.
How difficult it is for you.

470
00:31:54,706 --> 00:31:57,203
I wouldn't have told you if
I'd known this would happen.

471
00:31:57,223 --> 00:32:00,686
I know, Kurt, I know, I wish
you hadn't told me this...

472
00:32:01,733 --> 00:32:02,963
There's nothing I can do.

473
00:32:02,983 --> 00:32:05,198
- There's no use my knowing these things.
- No.

474
00:32:05,746 --> 00:32:11,885
No use, my poor little child.
Stay on your mountaintop.
We have so little time for happiness.

475
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:14,863
So little time and so much need.

476
00:32:19,681 --> 00:32:22,702
You take the tickets.
Section "N" in the reviewing stand.

477
00:32:22,722 --> 00:32:25,353
Hmm. Front row.
Of course, the General got them for us.

478
00:32:25,373 --> 00:32:27,574
It's a shame you have to miss
the biggest parade of the year.

479
00:32:27,594 --> 00:32:31,368
Oh, there will be other parades.
And a headache like mine
demands tea and quiet, not a parade.

480
00:32:31,388 --> 00:32:34,664
The sight of those goose stepping robots
is enough to give anybody a headache.

481
00:32:34,684 --> 00:32:39,518
Mary, it's silly of you to have a thought like that.
You mean it's very silly to express it out loud.

482
00:32:39,538 --> 00:32:42,269
- You say it out loud just once too often.
- Please, girls.

483
00:32:42,289 --> 00:32:44,860
If I feel better I'll join you later.
Otherwise you come back here.

484
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,628
- All right, yes.
- Goodbye.

485
00:32:53,651 --> 00:32:56,499
Are you sure there haven't
been any messages for me?

486
00:32:59,298 --> 00:33:00,453
Countess!

487
00:33:02,284 --> 00:33:05,567
Countess. I'm Mark Preysing.
Remember?

488
00:33:05,981 --> 00:33:07,386
Yes, of course.

489
00:33:08,121 --> 00:33:12,820
- Have you... Have you any news?
- I'm sorry.

490
00:33:13,067 --> 00:33:15,621
I knew you'd telephone me
if you found out anything.

491
00:33:15,753 --> 00:33:18,936
- Will you have some tea?
- I was just on my way to the parade.

492
00:33:18,956 --> 00:33:20,786
I would like to talk to you.

493
00:33:21,859 --> 00:33:25,272
You seem so sort of shocked at seeing
me, almost like you'd seen a ghost.

494
00:33:25,292 --> 00:33:27,825
Like I got dirt on my
face or something.

495
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:30,928
- I'd love some tea.
- Good.

496
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:41,954
- Doesn't seem to be any waiters around.
- It's a very important parade.

497
00:33:42,129 --> 00:33:44,970
One isn't supposed to
be interested in teas.

498
00:33:49,745 --> 00:33:51,604
Tell me what has happened.

499
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:55,452
I've been swinging like a pendulum
from one office to the next.

500
00:33:55,472 --> 00:33:57,869
American on the flying trapeze.

501
00:33:58,134 --> 00:34:01,899
One official catches me, gives me a little
twirl, then tosses me on to another.

502
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:04,996
Officials are the same all the world over.
It's heartbreaking.

503
00:34:05,016 --> 00:34:08,100
And I have that creepy feeling
of being continually watched.

504
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,332
I'm sure my room's been searched.

505
00:34:10,482 --> 00:34:15,631
It's like trying to fight shadows, or clutch
at water running through your fingers.

506
00:34:15,651 --> 00:34:17,603
I know.
I know.

507
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:23,695
It's such a relief sitting here,
talking to someone you can trust.

508
00:34:26,871 --> 00:34:29,829
I can sort of kid
myself that I'm happy.

509
00:34:30,893 --> 00:34:32,854
I know I oughtn't to, but...

510
00:34:32,874 --> 00:34:36,707
Nobody can be unhappy all the
time without a moment's relief.

511
00:34:37,081 --> 00:34:39,231
I remember I felt like you once.

512
00:34:39,522 --> 00:34:43,072
When my husband died and I was left
all alone in a strange country.

513
00:34:43,184 --> 00:34:46,422
Terribly young and wretched
with no one to turn to.

514
00:34:46,764 --> 00:34:49,131
But there were things, simple things...

515
00:34:49,632 --> 00:34:51,667
almost too small to speak of.

516
00:34:52,155 --> 00:34:55,015
A walk in our forest one
September evening...

517
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,456
a smile of a neighbor's child...

518
00:34:57,476 --> 00:34:59,082
firelight, music.

519
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:03,570
At times, I too had the illusion
of happiness and felt guilty.

520
00:35:06,905 --> 00:35:10,370
- But you're not listening.
- No, I was thinking.

521
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:15,572
You talk so simply and yet you're not simple.
There's a sort of mystery.

522
00:35:16,075 --> 00:35:18,601
A kind of unknown fear in your eyes.

523
00:35:19,389 --> 00:35:23,603
You talk as if you were doing it just to
kill time, in preparation for something.

524
00:35:24,133 --> 00:35:26,966
I'm not sure what
you're really thinking.

525
00:35:27,673 --> 00:35:29,175
I'm thinking that...

526
00:35:29,823 --> 00:35:32,512
if 12 years ago I had
not come to Europe,

527
00:35:32,532 --> 00:35:35,224
had stayed at home,
married an American,

528
00:35:35,864 --> 00:35:37,817
perhaps a boy like you,

529
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:40,703
you wouldn't find me
very extraordinary.

530
00:35:42,034 --> 00:35:44,522
I wish I had met you 12 years ago.

531
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:49,597
You know, there's a thing
of Kipling's that says...

532
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:53,453
We meet in an evil land,
near to the gates of hell...

533
00:35:55,157 --> 00:35:58,209
I wish I could get you out.
Out and away.

534
00:35:59,211 --> 00:36:01,530
Perhaps I don't want
to get out and away.

535
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:04,900
That's because you've forgotten
what it feels like to be free.

536
00:36:06,278 --> 00:36:08,677
I've forgotten so completely that...

537
00:36:09,475 --> 00:36:11,344
that I'd be almost afraid.

538
00:36:13,688 --> 00:36:15,106
I'd be with you.

539
00:36:18,454 --> 00:36:20,754
- Would you?
- Countess!

540
00:36:24,344 --> 00:36:26,860
- Countess!
- How do you do, Baron?

541
00:36:29,303 --> 00:36:32,853
Baron Von Reiber, may I present Mr Preysing.
How do you do?

542
00:36:33,103 --> 00:36:38,046
Will you be sure to give the General
my congratulations for a tremendous
success of today's parade.

543
00:36:38,066 --> 00:36:39,599
You're most kind, Baron.

544
00:36:39,619 --> 00:36:43,783
And don't forget, you and he are
dining with us on Thursday.

545
00:36:47,927 --> 00:36:51,719
The General... a relative?

546
00:36:51,739 --> 00:36:54,894
No, no, he's just a
friend of long standing.

547
00:36:55,016 --> 00:36:58,254
The Baron exaggerated his importance.

548
00:37:00,873 --> 00:37:05,088
Many army officers are not directly
connected with the political police and...

549
00:37:05,108 --> 00:37:06,608
even if they were, why...

550
00:37:08,408 --> 00:37:09,516
I see.

551
00:37:12,389 --> 00:37:15,906
After all I've lived here many years.
It's only natural that I'd have a few friends.

552
00:37:16,166 --> 00:37:18,337
Don't... it's all right.

553
00:37:18,357 --> 00:37:21,087
It's just that I'm an incurable fool.

554
00:37:24,797 --> 00:37:27,728
- I must be off, Mr Preysing.
- Just a minute.

555
00:37:28,189 --> 00:37:31,594
Since this General is such a trusty old
friend and I'm in such desperate trouble,

556
00:37:31,614 --> 00:37:34,345
why couldn't you have asked him for help?
That is, if you really wanted to help me.

557
00:37:34,365 --> 00:37:38,604
Mr Preysing, you must believe me.
I have not the slightest influence.

558
00:37:38,624 --> 00:37:42,285
- It would only make matters worse if I were to...
- Goodbye, Countess.

559
00:37:59,091 --> 00:38:02,603
Well, what did you think of the parade?
Wasn't it wonderful?

560
00:38:02,862 --> 00:38:08,730
- Everybody seemed very enthusiastic.
- They did indeed. I never heard such cheering.

561
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:10,728
The Marshall must have enjoyed it.

562
00:38:10,748 --> 00:38:13,752
Oh, well, he's a good fellow.
A little bit crude, of course,

563
00:38:13,978 --> 00:38:16,075
but he was certainly
very appreciative.

564
00:38:16,095 --> 00:38:18,710
Wants me to sit at his right
at the banquet tonight.

565
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:23,950
It means, of course, I shan't
be able to go to the concert.
I'm very, terribly sorry, my darling.

566
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:26,253
Oh, that's all right.

567
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:30,134
What's the matter, Ruby?

568
00:38:30,406 --> 00:38:35,039
This show today has been a
rather personal triumph for me.
I thought you'd be pleased.

569
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:39,752
Oh, Kurt, I am.
It's just that crowds always
give me a headache.

570
00:38:39,772 --> 00:38:42,092
I apologize for the crowds.

571
00:38:44,136 --> 00:38:45,657
Come, sit down.

572
00:38:46,305 --> 00:38:48,202
I like to have you beside me.

573
00:38:57,006 --> 00:39:01,109
Oh, do play something else, Kurt.
I thought Tristan was our favorite opera.

574
00:39:01,129 --> 00:39:04,121
Well, perhaps I've heard it too often.

575
00:39:06,034 --> 00:39:07,481
So...

576
00:39:12,134 --> 00:39:15,148
By the way, I have news of
the Emmy Ritter affair.

577
00:39:17,804 --> 00:39:20,725
I'll tell you tomorrow when
your head feels better.

578
00:39:22,549 --> 00:39:23,946
Have they pardoned her?

579
00:39:23,966 --> 00:39:26,718
No, no, no, of course not.
It's only about a son of hers.

580
00:39:26,738 --> 00:39:28,918
From America.
Did you know she had a son?

581
00:39:29,152 --> 00:39:32,632
Well, this boy has been going around
making an infernal nuisance of himself.

582
00:39:32,863 --> 00:39:34,450
So they tell me.

583
00:39:35,304 --> 00:39:37,360
- And?
- And...

584
00:39:37,589 --> 00:39:39,898
Oh, it's 6 o'clock. I must be off.
Dinner's at seven.

585
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:41,306
But you were telling me that...

586
00:39:41,326 --> 00:39:44,601
Oh, yes, about this boy.
Well, he's an American citizen...

587
00:39:44,621 --> 00:39:47,480
More's the pity, however, if
he goes on bothering us...

588
00:39:47,602 --> 00:39:50,640
- it can be taken care of.
- Taken care of?

589
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:52,164
Yes, taken care of.

590
00:39:52,896 --> 00:39:54,427
I see.

591
00:39:55,787 --> 00:40:02,842
I'm sorry, Ruby. It's just, you see,
there are moments that I cannot
resist the impulse to tease you.

592
00:40:02,862 --> 00:40:04,491
To hurt me, you mean.

593
00:40:04,511 --> 00:40:06,978
- It's not that I want to, it's just...
- No need to explain.

594
00:40:06,998 --> 00:40:08,214
You're tired.

595
00:40:08,694 --> 00:40:11,913
Be sure to have a rest before the concert.
Here are the tickets.

596
00:40:11,933 --> 00:40:14,033
Oh, I don't feel like going. I...

597
00:40:14,186 --> 00:40:15,321
I am very tired.

598
00:40:15,341 --> 00:40:16,730
Do you go to hear music?

599
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:19,379
Take one of the girls, or
telephone some friend.

600
00:40:21,852 --> 00:40:25,926
Yes, that might be an idea.

601
00:40:25,946 --> 00:40:27,598
Then good night, dear.

602
00:40:27,715 --> 00:40:29,189
Enjoy the concert.

603
00:41:02,709 --> 00:41:05,575
The concert's almost over.
I was afraid you weren't coming.

604
00:41:05,595 --> 00:41:08,709
Well, I was away from the hotel.
I didn't get your message until just now.

605
00:41:09,019 --> 00:41:11,469
I was awfully unfair
to you this afternoon.

606
00:41:11,873 --> 00:41:15,048
Someday I'm going to tell you how much
it meant to me getting this message.

607
00:41:15,068 --> 00:41:17,067
I should have known you'd
find some way to help me.

608
00:41:18,764 --> 00:41:22,381
- You're going to help me, aren't you?
- I have something to tell you.

609
00:41:23,003 --> 00:41:25,865
- I want to be your friend, believe me.
- What do you know?

610
00:41:25,885 --> 00:41:28,008
- Tell me!
- Keep your voice down.

611
00:41:28,028 --> 00:41:30,983
Then answer me.
My mother, if she's dead, say so.

612
00:41:31,003 --> 00:41:32,490
If she's alive, tell me
where I can find her.

613
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:33,860
Please, be quiet.

614
00:41:35,111 --> 00:41:36,843
It's dangerous for you here.

615
00:41:37,332 --> 00:41:38,600
What are you talking about?

616
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:40,961
- I don't care about myself.
- But I do.

617
00:41:40,981 --> 00:41:43,206
You must get away from here.
Go home.

618
00:41:43,226 --> 00:41:44,947
Go back to America at once.

619
00:41:46,972 --> 00:41:50,521
- You say that to me too?
- Quiet. It's the only thing that I can say.

620
00:41:50,723 --> 00:41:53,882
If you stay here you'll only get
into terrible trouble yourself.

621
00:41:56,887 --> 00:41:58,634
I've done all that I can.

622
00:41:59,019 --> 00:42:01,338
All that you've a right
to expect of me.

623
00:42:01,899 --> 00:42:06,114
Yes, you've been wonderful.
You've told me to go home,
to forget I have a mother.

624
00:42:06,294 --> 00:42:08,406
Why, you're worse than they are.

625
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:13,337
I was ready just now to tell you
that I'd found everything I ever
thought a woman should be.

626
00:42:13,357 --> 00:42:15,064
I was wrong.

627
00:42:15,084 --> 00:42:20,015
I haven't found anything except
a woman who wants to play safe
and hold on to what she's got.

628
00:42:20,035 --> 00:42:24,068
You're not only, not the woman I thought
you were, you're not even a human being!

629
00:42:24,088 --> 00:42:25,478
I could kill you.

630
00:42:37,552 --> 00:42:38,720
Countess!

631
00:42:39,062 --> 00:42:41,865
- Countess.
- Oh, Dr. Ditten.

632
00:42:42,621 --> 00:42:45,407
- It's good to see you again.
- It has been much too long.

633
00:42:45,427 --> 00:42:47,750
Tell me, have you been away in
the mountains all these weeks?

634
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:50,016
- Yes.
- How fortunate you are.

635
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:54,065
You know, all through the performance, I...
I couldn't take my eyes off you.

636
00:42:54,722 --> 00:42:57,056
If your friend doesn't object.

637
00:42:57,076 --> 00:43:00,661
Oh, that's right.
You haven't met, have you?

638
00:43:00,868 --> 00:43:02,634
- Dr. Ditten, may I introduce....
- Ruby!

639
00:43:02,906 --> 00:43:05,610
- Ruby, darling.
- Baroness, how nice.

640
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:07,725
- Countess.
- Good evening, Baron.

641
00:43:08,091 --> 00:43:11,161
Well, it looks as if we were all
caught in the rain, doesn't it?

642
00:43:11,181 --> 00:43:12,214
Yes.

643
00:43:12,234 --> 00:43:15,961
It's almost as if we have been
together throughout the day, isn't it?

644
00:43:17,228 --> 00:43:19,565
Would you mind dropping me, Edwige?

645
00:43:19,585 --> 00:43:21,322
It would save my friends
going out of their way.

646
00:43:21,342 --> 00:43:24,533
Darling, we would just love to
have you with us. Come along.

647
00:43:24,553 --> 00:43:28,010
Goodbye, Dr Ditten, you must
come and have tea with me soon.

648
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:29,696
Thank you, I will.

649
00:43:47,065 --> 00:43:50,370
Excuse me, but I have an umbrella.
May I share it with you?

650
00:43:50,679 --> 00:43:52,650
No, thanks, I haven't far to go.

651
00:43:52,848 --> 00:43:57,224
The evening is so young, I wonder if you would
do me the honor of having a drink with me.

652
00:43:58,304 --> 00:44:01,348
Yes, thanks.
I could do with a drink.

653
00:44:01,368 --> 00:44:02,741
That's fine.

654
00:44:26,933 --> 00:44:28,088
So...

655
00:44:31,289 --> 00:44:33,064
I like this place.

656
00:44:33,827 --> 00:44:38,719
It's like my pipe.
Very old, not very fashionable.

657
00:44:41,005 --> 00:44:42,104
Waiters!

658
00:44:44,792 --> 00:44:46,764
I should have worn my uniform.

659
00:44:47,534 --> 00:44:49,825
- Army?
- No.

660
00:44:50,927 --> 00:44:52,617
Hello.
Two, please.

661
00:44:58,274 --> 00:45:00,603
I have had a most unpleasant day.

662
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:06,319
Well, to life.
Good or bad, at least it is life.

663
00:45:12,808 --> 00:45:14,631
Have you known the Countess long?

664
00:45:14,845 --> 00:45:18,834
- Not in America.
- So, charming woman, the Countess.

665
00:45:20,212 --> 00:45:23,730
- A happy one?
- Happy? Yes, I think so.

666
00:45:24,046 --> 00:45:26,541
Her life is ordered and secure.

667
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:28,814
I see no reason why she
shouldn't be happy.

668
00:45:29,047 --> 00:45:30,537
No, I suppose not.

669
00:45:30,557 --> 00:45:34,709
When she first came to this country she and
I used to have long, passionate debates.

670
00:45:34,729 --> 00:45:40,340
She was full of your naive American
political theories about the rights of...

671
00:45:41,647 --> 00:45:42,697
No...

672
00:45:42,836 --> 00:45:45,799
No, I don't think we'll
talk about that.

673
00:45:47,634 --> 00:45:50,531
- Thanks, now I can enjoy my beer.
- Hmm, good.

674
00:45:51,084 --> 00:45:54,802
Maybe, this would be a
good moment to confess.

675
00:45:55,666 --> 00:45:56,962
Confess what?

676
00:45:57,529 --> 00:46:00,045
I had an ulterior motive
in asking you here.

677
00:46:00,224 --> 00:46:04,698
There are certain American medical journals
which are very, very difficult to obtain.

678
00:46:05,450 --> 00:46:10,765
I know we are strangers, but this is an
opportunity which may not happen again.

679
00:46:10,906 --> 00:46:12,728
- Would you do me...?
- Of course.

680
00:46:12,748 --> 00:46:13,975
What do you want and
where shall I send them?

681
00:46:13,995 --> 00:46:16,320
Oh, that's fine.
Very kind of you.

682
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:18,512
I'll write everything down.

683
00:46:22,053 --> 00:46:24,429
I hope my handwriting
doesn't confuse you.

684
00:46:27,645 --> 00:46:29,805
My name is Dr. Ditten.

685
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:32,030
Berthold Ditten.

686
00:46:32,752 --> 00:46:35,165
48 Linnenwey.

687
00:46:37,297 --> 00:46:38,824
Oh, my apologies.

688
00:46:39,079 --> 00:46:41,342
I just realized I
don't know your name.

689
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:45,376
- Preysing. Mark Preysing.
- So, Mark Prey...

690
00:46:47,938 --> 00:46:50,412
Did you say Mark Preysing?

691
00:46:51,548 --> 00:46:52,919
Yes, what's the matter?

692
00:46:54,739 --> 00:46:57,265
- That's very strange.
- Is it?

693
00:46:59,547 --> 00:47:02,455
Are you Madame Emmy Ritter's son?

694
00:47:03,535 --> 00:47:04,558
Yes.

695
00:47:08,962 --> 00:47:10,062
Well, ahh...

696
00:47:11,667 --> 00:47:12,910
...this is for you.

697
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:30,969
When did she give it to you?

698
00:47:31,135 --> 00:47:32,365
On Monday.

699
00:47:35,523 --> 00:47:37,992
- She's still alive.
- Yes.

700
00:47:40,613 --> 00:47:43,940
- Who are you?
- I'm a doctor.

701
00:47:44,133 --> 00:47:47,028
- At a concentration camp.
- Where is it?

702
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:49,372
I'm sorry.

703
00:47:50,205 --> 00:47:51,779
How much time has she?

704
00:47:52,108 --> 00:47:54,230
- Not much.
- How much?

705
00:47:54,822 --> 00:47:55,762
Tell me!

706
00:47:56,866 --> 00:47:59,265
Saturday.
Early in the morning.

707
00:48:00,516 --> 00:48:02,667
It's Thursday now.
What can I do?

708
00:48:02,687 --> 00:48:03,648
You better go now.

709
00:48:03,668 --> 00:48:05,001
No, answer me.
What can I do?

710
00:48:05,021 --> 00:48:06,562
Please keep your voice down.

711
00:48:06,582 --> 00:48:08,776
- Nothing you can do.
- But there must be something.

712
00:48:08,796 --> 00:48:11,169
- There's no chance of escape.
- I don't believe you.

713
00:48:11,189 --> 00:48:14,655
Please, Mr Preysing, believe me,
this is not a place to talk.

714
00:48:30,044 --> 00:48:33,486
- Mr Preysing, let me say this.
- Haven't you said enough already?

715
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:35,858
I'll try to make it easier for her.

716
00:48:37,770 --> 00:48:40,876
- I'm sorry. My nerves are all...
- I understand.

717
00:48:40,896 --> 00:48:43,702
Would you like to send her a message?

718
00:48:44,135 --> 00:48:45,449
I don't know.

719
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:49,106
- Yes, tell her I...
- I must go now.

720
00:48:49,126 --> 00:48:51,099
Would you come to my
flat tomorrow night?

721
00:48:51,313 --> 00:48:53,453
How I'm going to live
until tomorrow night?

722
00:48:53,473 --> 00:48:54,928
Until tomorrow then.

723
00:49:03,584 --> 00:49:05,603
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

724
00:49:16,564 --> 00:49:19,146
Hello, Mr Mark.

725
00:49:20,301 --> 00:49:21,578
So it's you.

726
00:49:25,543 --> 00:49:27,186
Leave me alone.

727
00:49:29,543 --> 00:49:31,515
Why should you blame me?

728
00:49:31,872 --> 00:49:35,149
I... I couldn't talk to you then.

729
00:49:35,356 --> 00:49:37,393
My helper would have
told me my sister...

730
00:49:37,413 --> 00:49:41,302
- and she would have turned me over like that!
- Stop talking so much!

731
00:49:41,749 --> 00:49:44,123
They're going to kill her!
Do you hear me? Kill her!

732
00:49:44,143 --> 00:49:45,805
Please, Mr Mark.

733
00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:55,036
I did what I could!

734
00:49:56,698 --> 00:50:00,923
The day before she was
arrested, I said to her...

735
00:50:01,055 --> 00:50:03,515
"Madame, you have your money.

736
00:50:03,535 --> 00:50:04,620
All right.

737
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:07,599
So take the next train and go!

738
00:50:07,619 --> 00:50:08,568
Go now!"

739
00:50:09,084 --> 00:50:11,856
But would she ever listen to me?

740
00:50:11,876 --> 00:50:15,509
- She's still alive.
- But after she was arrested...

741
00:50:15,828 --> 00:50:19,922
the trouble I had.
They took away my money...

742
00:50:20,166 --> 00:50:23,057
my job, and they took away everything.

743
00:50:23,987 --> 00:50:26,680
As if I was a criminal, not she.

744
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:29,093
Did you ever hear of such a thing?

745
00:50:30,098 --> 00:50:32,435
And then the trial.

746
00:50:33,787 --> 00:50:35,431
Would she keep quiet?

747
00:50:35,557 --> 00:50:40,570
Oh, no. Oh, no. You know her.
She had to make speeches.

748
00:50:40,590 --> 00:50:43,237
My tongue is my freedom, she said.

749
00:50:44,206 --> 00:50:46,685
Well, she used it too much.

750
00:50:46,948 --> 00:50:50,340
For years I have warned her, Mr Mark.

751
00:50:50,625 --> 00:50:53,684
Madame, don't, I said.
Please, don't.

752
00:50:53,704 --> 00:50:55,178
- Fritz!
- Mr Mark, what?

753
00:50:55,198 --> 00:50:56,896
You've gotta think of some
way of getting her out.

754
00:50:56,916 --> 00:50:59,447
When I was a kid Fritz, you
always helped me. Help me now!

755
00:50:59,467 --> 00:51:01,419
Please, Mr Mark, let go of me.

756
00:51:01,439 --> 00:51:02,982
But I've got money.
The money from the house.

757
00:51:03,002 --> 00:51:05,869
Use any part of it. All of it.
You've got to do something.

758
00:51:06,144 --> 00:51:10,136
- No.. No, I can do nothing.
- You've got to!

759
00:51:10,577 --> 00:51:12,624
Who else here can help me now but you?

760
00:51:15,174 --> 00:51:16,404
All right.
Shh.

761
00:51:16,424 --> 00:51:20,390
- Fritz!
- All right, all right, don't get excited.

762
00:51:20,774 --> 00:51:23,873
I think I can get her out.

763
00:51:25,293 --> 00:51:27,934
Yes, Mr Mark, yes.

764
00:51:27,954 --> 00:51:32,503
When it is over, they won't throw
her into any prison lime pit.

765
00:51:32,781 --> 00:51:36,011
- What are you talking about?
- I now, I know my duty.

766
00:51:37,191 --> 00:51:42,261
I'll claim the body, I'll
give her a decent burial...

767
00:51:42,655 --> 00:51:48,078
Yes, now you have money, I'll give her
a coffin with those...bronze handles.

768
00:51:48,098 --> 00:51:51,438
Fritz, are you crazy?
She's not dead yet. Not dead.

769
00:51:51,578 --> 00:51:55,573
- Mr Mark, please. When the police get me...
- You always think of yourself!

770
00:51:55,593 --> 00:51:56,822
Don't you ever think of her?

771
00:51:56,842 --> 00:52:00,349
I've lived through enough troubles.
I've got to go now.

772
00:52:00,369 --> 00:52:02,709
I have to go and sign papers.

773
00:52:03,592 --> 00:52:08,483
In this country you even can't
get buried without papers.

774
00:52:09,611 --> 00:52:13,358
Nurse! Nurse!

775
00:52:14,691 --> 00:52:17,207
My heart! Help me.

776
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:21,866
- Help!
- Oh, stop it!

777
00:52:30,968 --> 00:52:34,104
Dr. Ditten! Dr. Ditten!

778
00:52:34,442 --> 00:52:35,309
Come!

779
00:52:39,466 --> 00:52:40,902
Look at her.

780
00:52:46,225 --> 00:52:47,896
The stethoscope.

781
00:52:58,446 --> 00:52:59,496
Heart block.

782
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:01,713
- Well, It's not my fault.
- Quiet.

783
00:53:02,809 --> 00:53:06,576
Well, it looks as if you're going to
lose your star patient, Dr. Ditten.

784
00:53:07,053 --> 00:53:09,325
Maybe you think you can still save her.

785
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:13,926
Some of us overestimate our
abilities now and then, don't we?

786
00:53:14,471 --> 00:53:18,130
Yes. We gamble everything
on being right.

787
00:53:19,766 --> 00:53:21,683
Sometimes, of course, we lose.

788
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:26,984
Dr. Ditten, there's a Mr Preysing
waiting for you in the living-room.

789
00:53:29,976 --> 00:53:32,819
Ah, Hilda, I won't need
you any more tonight.

790
00:53:32,839 --> 00:53:34,098
Oh, thank you.

791
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:37,480
- Good evening, Mr Preysing.
- Good evening.

792
00:53:38,797 --> 00:53:40,740
I was worried you might not come.

793
00:53:40,956 --> 00:53:42,403
Have you seen her today?

794
00:53:43,632 --> 00:53:46,693
- Have you seen her today?!
- Yes, yes, I've seen her today.

795
00:53:51,569 --> 00:53:55,147
Tell me, your mother's
heart was always strong?

796
00:53:56,255 --> 00:53:57,755
Why do you ask that?

797
00:53:58,705 --> 00:54:02,311
Because today I did a criminal thing.

798
00:54:03,391 --> 00:54:04,895
- You killed her?
- Well, I...

799
00:54:04,915 --> 00:54:06,042
- You killed her!
- Please, Mr Preysing.

800
00:54:06,062 --> 00:54:08,551
- But you said you...
- Please, Mr Preysing, let me explain.

801
00:54:09,546 --> 00:54:11,348
Your mother was condemned
to die tomorrow.

802
00:54:11,368 --> 00:54:13,659
- What's that got to do with it?
- You listen to me!

803
00:54:15,207 --> 00:54:19,967
I gave your mother a certain drug which
produced a condition known as bradicardia.

804
00:54:20,399 --> 00:54:23,357
A coma-like state, you
see, apparently death.

805
00:54:23,770 --> 00:54:25,039
But she is not dead.

806
00:54:25,488 --> 00:54:28,681
They called me in, I signed
the certificate of death.

807
00:54:28,831 --> 00:54:30,224
But she is alive.

808
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:32,947
In a coma, yes, but alive.

809
00:54:34,045 --> 00:54:36,933
Well, why don't you say something?

810
00:54:38,134 --> 00:54:39,693
I don't understand.

811
00:54:39,928 --> 00:54:44,150
I deliberately drugged your mother,
pronounced her dead, but she is not dead.

812
00:54:46,161 --> 00:54:47,751
I can't believe that...

813
00:54:47,771 --> 00:54:49,475
Tomorrow you would have
accepted her death...

814
00:54:49,495 --> 00:54:52,495
I know that.
Today, why don't you accept her life?

815
00:54:53,038 --> 00:54:55,536
- I'm all mixed up. It's happened so quickly.
- I understand, but...

816
00:54:55,996 --> 00:54:58,935
now you've got your chance.
You must get her out of the camp.

817
00:54:59,893 --> 00:55:02,309
- The camp? How can I go there?
- Huh?

818
00:55:02,687 --> 00:55:06,413
I'm not even supposed to know where she is,
let alone that she's supposed to be dead.

819
00:55:06,433 --> 00:55:09,896
Even if I got her out, where would I
take her, where could I hide her?

820
00:55:09,916 --> 00:55:13,866
All I thought about was to save her.
Listen, Preysing...

821
00:55:14,126 --> 00:55:15,796
You must find someone to help you.

822
00:55:16,361 --> 00:55:18,571
You must get the coffin out of the camp.

823
00:55:20,229 --> 00:55:21,239
Coffin?

824
00:55:22,972 --> 00:55:25,874
- She'll suffocate.
- Oh, no, no, no.

825
00:55:26,343 --> 00:55:29,300
Those coffins are loosely made.
But if you delay...

826
00:55:29,901 --> 00:55:31,628
when you open it, she may be dead.

827
00:55:32,023 --> 00:55:33,561
You must act quickly.

828
00:55:36,304 --> 00:55:37,975
- Fritz.
- Fritz who?

829
00:55:38,450 --> 00:55:41,162
An old servant. I'd almost forgotten.

830
00:55:41,887 --> 00:55:43,980
He's already arranged to claim the body.

831
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:46,563
That's fine. The telephone.
Tell him its happened.

832
00:55:48,685 --> 00:55:51,079
Tell him to go to the camp
at once and meet you.

833
00:55:52,482 --> 00:55:56,506
Hello, operator.
Get me Fritz Keller in Felzenkirche.

834
00:55:57,918 --> 00:56:01,090
No, I don't know the number.
Just Felzenkirche.

835
00:56:01,730 --> 00:56:05,589
- Tell him to meet me where?
- At the White Swan Inn. It's close to the camp.

836
00:56:05,609 --> 00:56:06,752
You'll have to work quickly.

837
00:56:06,772 --> 00:56:07,849
Get her out of the coffin.

838
00:56:07,869 --> 00:56:09,089
Dress her warmly.

839
00:56:09,109 --> 00:56:10,949
Warmth is of the greatest importance.

840
00:56:11,061 --> 00:56:14,950
Yes, operator, I'm waiting.
Is there any medicine, any stimulant?

841
00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:19,002
No, no. The only thing is to get her to a
place where she can rest. Warmth and rest.

842
00:56:19,387 --> 00:56:20,968
Fritz will know where to...

843
00:56:21,709 --> 00:56:23,089
What's the matter?

844
00:56:23,869 --> 00:56:26,806
- What if he won't help me?
- You said he was your friend.

845
00:56:27,501 --> 00:56:30,064
I'm not sure.
He's so afraid of everything.

846
00:56:30,834 --> 00:56:34,817
Then don't tell him that she's alive.
No, your only worry is to get her
out and keep her warm.

847
00:56:34,837 --> 00:56:37,437
Blankets, yes, and a warm coat.

848
00:56:37,841 --> 00:56:40,535
Hello. Hello, is that you, Fritz?

849
00:56:40,555 --> 00:56:42,240
Yes, now listen.

850
00:56:42,522 --> 00:56:45,450
Mother... my mother just died at the camp.

851
00:56:45,470 --> 00:56:49,037
They're waiting for you...
Fritz, don't ask questions.

852
00:56:49,516 --> 00:56:50,397
What?

853
00:56:51,024 --> 00:56:52,686
They've already phoned him.

854
00:56:52,808 --> 00:56:57,136
Now, Fritz, wait. When you get the
coffin, meet me at the White Swan Inn.

855
00:56:57,156 --> 00:56:59,195
I want to be with you when you bury her.

856
00:56:59,748 --> 00:57:02,565
But Fritz, there's nothing to worry about.
It's all over.

857
00:57:02,921 --> 00:57:04,912
What's the difference if you are with me?

858
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:07,696
Don't argue, Fritz.
Get to the camp quickly.

859
00:57:07,716 --> 00:57:09,166
I'll meet you at the White Swan at...

860
00:57:09,973 --> 00:57:13,681
- Three hours.
- At eleven, Fritz. Do you hear me?

861
00:57:13,813 --> 00:57:15,456
At eleven. Goodbye.

862
00:57:17,774 --> 00:57:19,052
Come on.

863
00:57:19,831 --> 00:57:23,446
Steady. I think I had better
get back to the camp myself.

864
00:57:32,408 --> 00:57:34,369
Why are you doing all this for me?

865
00:57:34,389 --> 00:57:37,431
My friend, to know the answer...

866
00:57:37,959 --> 00:57:40,155
you would have to know my entire life..

867
00:57:40,175 --> 00:57:44,042
my parents' lives, the lives
of everyone I have ever met...

868
00:57:44,709 --> 00:57:47,169
you'd have to know every
word ever said to me...

869
00:57:47,189 --> 00:57:49,142
every word I have ever said...

870
00:57:49,782 --> 00:57:53,142
I've, seen, read, thought about...

871
00:57:53,643 --> 00:57:55,407
But to put it simply,

872
00:57:55,427 --> 00:58:00,529
say that for the moment I'm just like
a cat who chews green stuff so as
to purge himself of poison.

873
00:58:00,549 --> 00:58:05,117
I can't let it go like this. Suppose I bungle
the rest of it, what will happen to you?

874
00:58:05,586 --> 00:58:08,931
- I have to count on you, Mark Preysing.
- I'll see you again.

875
00:58:09,466 --> 00:58:12,066
I'm afraid not.
It would be too dangerous.

876
00:58:13,091 --> 00:58:14,691
My regards to America.

877
00:58:15,138 --> 00:58:16,258
Now hurry.

878
00:58:53,222 --> 00:58:54,254
Yes, sir.

879
00:58:54,274 --> 00:58:56,472
- Coffee, please.
- Yes, sir.

880
00:59:06,417 --> 00:59:08,408
- Get me some brandy, will you.
- Yes, sir.

881
00:59:08,428 --> 00:59:10,577
But I must serve them first.

882
00:59:13,777 --> 00:59:14,813
Yes, sir?

883
00:59:15,067 --> 00:59:16,324
- Beer.
- Beer.

884
00:59:16,344 --> 00:59:17,312
Yes, sir.

885
00:59:17,884 --> 00:59:19,494
- Waiter.
- Yes, sir?

886
00:59:20,321 --> 00:59:22,142
Have you got a pack of cards?

887
00:59:22,162 --> 00:59:25,235
Yes, sir, I will bring them to you.

888
01:00:26,985 --> 01:00:28,309
Thank you.

889
01:00:43,256 --> 01:00:44,674
Anything else?

890
01:00:49,562 --> 01:00:52,860
- Will there be anything later, sir?
- Why?

891
01:00:53,053 --> 01:00:55,272
We're closing in a half an hour.

892
01:00:55,484 --> 01:00:59,177
- Closing?
- They are very strict here because of...

893
01:01:01,182 --> 01:01:02,197
No.

894
01:01:25,918 --> 01:01:27,789
What is that game?

895
01:01:30,227 --> 01:01:32,673
- It's an American game.
- Oh.

896
01:01:32,693 --> 01:01:35,155
What are you doing here?

897
01:01:35,175 --> 01:01:39,654
What am I doing here? I might ask
what are you doing here at my table.

898
01:01:39,674 --> 01:01:41,598
Political Police.

899
01:01:41,618 --> 01:01:45,528
Oh, well, I'm an American.

900
01:01:45,548 --> 01:01:48,603
You have your passport?

901
01:01:48,623 --> 01:01:49,863
Certainly.

902
01:02:04,925 --> 01:02:06,813
And what are you doing here?

903
01:02:08,409 --> 01:02:09,994
I'm here to meet a friend.

904
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:11,735
What friend?

905
01:02:12,984 --> 01:02:15,899
Is it a usual custom of this
country to annoy visitors?

906
01:02:15,919 --> 01:02:18,112
You're required to answer all questions.

907
01:02:18,132 --> 01:02:20,354
Unless, of course, you
wish to be detained.

908
01:02:22,310 --> 01:02:24,734
Why are you so concerned with the time?

909
01:02:25,146 --> 01:02:27,014
I have an appointment.

910
01:02:33,597 --> 01:02:35,669
What's this?

911
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:40,895
Oh, a fur coat.

912
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:44,051
A woman's fur coat.

913
01:02:44,573 --> 01:02:46,338
What is this for?

914
01:02:46,488 --> 01:02:48,187
Maybe it is for his friend.

915
01:02:48,207 --> 01:02:51,459
Oh... that kind of appointment, huh?

916
01:02:51,879 --> 01:02:53,625
She's coming here?

917
01:02:55,259 --> 01:02:58,780
No, I'm not to meet her here.
That comes later.

918
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:00,818
I'm waiting here for a
man, a friend of mine.

919
01:03:00,838 --> 01:03:01,686
Who?

920
01:03:04,334 --> 01:03:07,423
- A man I know.
- You said that. What is his name?

921
01:03:09,474 --> 01:03:11,117
You're required to answer.

922
01:03:12,516 --> 01:03:16,064
- His name is Ditten.
- Why do you want to meet him here?

923
01:03:16,778 --> 01:03:19,051
Because he asked me to.
Isn't that a good enough reason?

924
01:03:19,311 --> 01:03:20,445
Where does he live?

925
01:03:21,624 --> 01:03:24,000
He's attached to a camp near here.
He's a doctor.

926
01:03:24,802 --> 01:03:28,506
Might also interest you to know that
he's a member of the Political Police.

927
01:03:28,783 --> 01:03:30,915
Why does he want you to meet him here?

928
01:03:31,093 --> 01:03:33,102
I told you he's a friend of mine.

929
01:03:33,122 --> 01:03:35,074
What time are you to meet him?

930
01:03:35,094 --> 01:03:39,228
At... eleven. Yes, at eleven.

931
01:03:39,248 --> 01:03:40,916
Then why is he not here?

932
01:03:43,066 --> 01:03:46,959
- I must have missed him. I was late.
- Do you expect to go on waiting here all night?

933
01:03:47,872 --> 01:03:50,027
Is there any reason why I shouldn't?

934
01:04:00,215 --> 01:04:02,951
Why are you so interested
in our military transports?

935
01:04:04,006 --> 01:04:05,850
I thought it might be the doctor.

936
01:04:12,698 --> 01:04:14,998
What did you say his name was?

937
01:04:17,611 --> 01:04:19,495
Ditten. Dr. Ditten.

938
01:04:20,255 --> 01:04:21,414
Ditten.

939
01:04:25,421 --> 01:04:26,604
Thank you.

940
01:04:37,404 --> 01:04:39,208
We are closing now.

941
01:04:46,177 --> 01:04:49,370
I am sorry, but we have to close now.

942
01:04:52,337 --> 01:04:56,994
- Couldn't I stay just a little while longer?
- It is the regulation.

943
01:05:23,357 --> 01:05:27,619
It's getting very cold.
I'm sorry to turn you out.

944
01:05:28,634 --> 01:05:32,073
- When is the next bus back to town?
- In about a half an hour.

945
01:05:32,233 --> 01:05:36,085
That's just enough time for you to go to
the camp and see if your friend is there.

946
01:05:36,105 --> 01:05:39,230
Oh, no thanks. I think I'll wait
for the bus and go back to town.

947
01:05:39,456 --> 01:05:40,143
Come.

948
01:05:42,231 --> 01:05:43,142
Come!

949
01:05:51,735 --> 01:05:54,448
We want to be sure you see your friend.

950
01:06:30,141 --> 01:06:31,855
Well, what is it?

951
01:06:32,873 --> 01:06:36,487
Commandant, I've picked up an
American down at the White Swan Caf.

952
01:06:36,507 --> 01:06:39,327
Said he was to meet a Dr.
Ditten there. An American?

953
01:06:39,347 --> 01:06:41,609
His name is Preysing. You know him?

954
01:06:41,956 --> 01:06:44,139
No. I knew he was lying.

955
01:06:44,322 --> 01:06:48,019
Snooping around like all... No, no...
You will excuse me, sir.

956
01:06:48,774 --> 01:06:53,516
There must be a mistake.
I had an appointment with Mr Preysing.

957
01:06:53,536 --> 01:06:56,108
I told him about his mother.
I mentioned your name.

958
01:06:56,128 --> 01:06:57,827
Speak when you're spoken to.

959
01:06:59,155 --> 01:07:01,573
I don't know your man. Send him away.

960
01:07:02,817 --> 01:07:03,906
Wait.

961
01:07:04,141 --> 01:07:07,010
Doctor, shouldn't he be
held for questioning?

962
01:07:07,527 --> 01:07:11,283
Yes, yes, I suppose so.
I'll talk to him myself.

963
01:07:16,405 --> 01:07:18,236
Here. The death certificate.

964
01:07:18,424 --> 01:07:19,675
Nurse!

965
01:07:22,723 --> 01:07:25,061
Help this man to get the body out of here.

966
01:07:31,339 --> 01:07:34,456
So you were lying to me.
He doesn't even know him.

967
01:07:34,681 --> 01:07:36,644
- You're under arrest.
- Wait.

968
01:07:36,757 --> 01:07:38,062
I'll handle this.

969
01:07:39,945 --> 01:07:42,734
Why did you tell these men you
had an appointment with me?

970
01:07:42,908 --> 01:07:45,014
Why didn't you tell them the truth?

971
01:07:45,034 --> 01:07:47,539
They were only doing their
duty questioning you.

972
01:07:47,952 --> 01:07:49,481
Why didn't you tell them...

973
01:07:49,501 --> 01:07:51,144
you came here about your mother?

974
01:07:52,475 --> 01:07:54,550
Yes, I should have.

975
01:07:57,049 --> 01:07:58,627
They're bringing her out.

976
01:08:45,092 --> 01:08:47,242
Stop! Put that down.

977
01:08:54,408 --> 01:08:56,699
What are you going to do with this?

978
01:08:57,488 --> 01:08:59,826
We're going to bury her.

979
01:09:00,117 --> 01:09:02,886
Do it here!
We've got a place at the back for it!

980
01:09:02,906 --> 01:09:05,525
But we have permission to
take her to bury her outside.

981
01:09:05,799 --> 01:09:07,085
Oh, have you?

982
01:09:07,414 --> 01:09:08,681
Yes, sir.

983
01:09:13,187 --> 01:09:15,431
Here. They say... I can read.

984
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,665
Would you mind hurrying, please?

985
01:09:24,630 --> 01:09:27,184
She's dead, isn't she?
Then what's the hurry?

986
01:09:29,318 --> 01:09:31,374
- And that is the coffin?
- Yes.

987
01:09:31,787 --> 01:09:33,496
I will have to see the body.

988
01:09:36,481 --> 01:09:37,946
Go on. Open it.

989
01:09:53,426 --> 01:09:55,933
- Is this Emmy Ritter?
- Yes.

990
01:10:02,649 --> 01:10:04,132
Wait a minute.

991
01:10:04,611 --> 01:10:07,624
- Why isn't this nailed down?
- He said he would do it himself.

992
01:10:07,644 --> 01:10:09,409
All right, then. Get to work.

993
01:10:10,251 --> 01:10:13,965
- Nail it down!
- We'll do it before we bury her.

994
01:10:14,138 --> 01:10:15,847
I'm not talking to you!

995
01:10:16,467 --> 01:10:18,428
Come on, nail it down!

996
01:10:45,362 --> 01:10:47,202
All right, get it out of here.

997
01:11:35,302 --> 01:11:36,963
- All right, Fritz, pull up.
- What for?

998
01:11:36,983 --> 01:11:38,673
I've got to get her out. She'll suffocate.

999
01:11:38,693 --> 01:11:42,240
Poor Mr Mark, you have had so much trouble.
Try not to think about it.

1000
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:44,279
Fritz, in heaven's name, stop the car.
She's alive!

1001
01:11:44,299 --> 01:11:46,982
- Mr Mark, such crazy talk.
- Fritz, stop the car!

1002
01:11:47,002 --> 01:11:48,204
No, Mr Mark.

1003
01:11:50,149 --> 01:11:51,134
Are you mad?

1004
01:11:51,154 --> 01:11:53,746
I'm going back with her.
As soon as I'm in, get going.

1005
01:13:39,895 --> 01:13:42,102
Mr Mark! Mr Mark!

1006
01:13:42,271 --> 01:13:44,308
The road ahead, it's blocked.

1007
01:13:54,401 --> 01:13:55,331
Mr Mark.

1008
01:13:56,477 --> 01:13:59,824
Mr Mark, the road ahead, it's blocked.

1009
01:14:01,390 --> 01:14:05,113
It doesn't matter, Fritz. She's dead.

1010
01:14:05,373 --> 01:14:08,066
Dead... What's the matter
with you, Mr Mark?

1011
01:14:08,086 --> 01:14:09,707
Of course she's dead!

1012
01:14:09,848 --> 01:14:12,374
Please, come out of there, Mr Mark.

1013
01:14:13,867 --> 01:14:15,679
She was alive, Fritz.

1014
01:14:16,684 --> 01:14:24,332
Oh, please, Mr Mark. You must try to
keep your mind away from what happened.

1015
01:14:24,352 --> 01:14:28,352
- Come on. I'll help you cover her over again.
- No, no. Leave her alone.

1016
01:14:28,372 --> 01:14:31,098
Please, Mr Mark, stop acting like a child!

1017
01:14:31,118 --> 01:14:34,648
Your mother was dead, she is dead.
And nothing you can do...

1018
01:14:37,392 --> 01:14:38,392
Mother!

1019
01:14:38,951 --> 01:14:44,051
Oh, madame! Oh, madame!

1020
01:14:44,071 --> 01:14:46,321
Don't just stand there, get the truck started.
We've got to get her to a house.

1021
01:14:46,425 --> 01:14:47,871
- Your sister's.
- But we...

1022
01:14:47,891 --> 01:14:50,020
- Go on, go on!
- But we can't go on.

1023
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:51,281
The slide blocked the road.

1024
01:14:51,301 --> 01:14:54,739
- All right, then we'll take the other way.
- But this is the only way there...

1025
01:14:54,759 --> 01:14:58,673
You're lying! You're afraid.
All right I don't need you.
I'll get it through myself. Now get out!

1026
01:14:58,693 --> 01:15:04,949
Please, Mr Mark, don't talk to me that way.
Sure I'm afraid. Why shouldn't I be afraid?

1027
01:15:04,969 --> 01:15:10,286
But she is alive and wherever
you go with her I'll go too.

1028
01:15:11,328 --> 01:15:18,309
- So please don't tell me to get out, Mr Mark.
- She'll die if we don't get her where it's warm.

1029
01:15:18,329 --> 01:15:20,687
Ya, Herr, but where?

1030
01:15:21,362 --> 01:15:25,869
- Fritz, where are we?
- In the park, near Felzenkirche.

1031
01:15:25,889 --> 01:15:28,405
- Felzenkirche. I know?
- Where?

1032
01:15:28,425 --> 01:15:30,063
- The Countess's house.
- But how do you...?

1033
01:15:30,083 --> 01:15:34,297
Don't ask questions. She'll have to let us in.
It's a green house just below the pass.
Now get started.

1034
01:15:34,317 --> 01:15:37,436
Green house just below the pass...

1035
01:15:38,108 --> 01:15:42,136
Green house below the pass...

1036
01:16:15,788 --> 01:16:16,614
Kurt.

1037
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:19,490
Why did you bother coming down?

1038
01:16:21,387 --> 01:16:23,496
Don't leave like this.

1039
01:16:24,097 --> 01:16:28,078
It's almost six. My skiing party
will be waiting for me at the Inn.

1040
01:16:28,728 --> 01:16:31,235
Kurt, don't be angry.

1041
01:16:32,711 --> 01:16:35,406
If I could tell you what's the
matter, I would. But I...

1042
01:16:35,753 --> 01:16:37,872
I can't seem to put it into words.

1043
01:16:38,385 --> 01:16:42,028
My dear, that stupid doctor you sent
me to warned me against two things.

1044
01:16:42,048 --> 01:16:45,791
One was violent exercise, like skiing,
the other was violent quarrels.

1045
01:16:45,811 --> 01:16:47,828
At the present I prefer skiing.

1046
01:16:48,134 --> 01:16:52,998
The doctor is an idiot, and so are you my dear.
But as usual, I forgive you. I'll see you tonight.

1047
01:17:40,129 --> 01:17:41,603
I've come to you for help.

1048
01:17:43,012 --> 01:17:45,772
What is it? My mother. Let me in.
I've no other place to take her.

1049
01:17:45,792 --> 01:17:49,403
- Oh, no. No, not here.
- But you must. She'll die.

1050
01:17:51,326 --> 01:17:54,076
No, please.
No, not in there.

1051
01:17:54,096 --> 01:17:56,293
- Where then?
- Let me see.

1052
01:17:56,547 --> 01:17:57,674
Upstairs.

1053
01:18:00,408 --> 01:18:02,023
Quiet, please.

1054
01:18:03,037 --> 01:18:04,967
The room at the end of the hall.

1055
01:18:16,434 --> 01:18:19,992
Those two in there,
they will never forget.

1056
01:18:20,012 --> 01:18:21,175
What happened?

1057
01:18:21,464 --> 01:18:27,368
They thought Madame Ritter died last night.
But we found she really was not dead.

1058
01:18:27,388 --> 01:18:32,988
So we got her out. Yes.
And that is how it was.

1059
01:18:33,833 --> 01:18:35,720
I don't think I believe you.

1060
01:18:36,393 --> 01:18:37,568
Well...

1061
01:18:38,021 --> 01:18:40,246
You know she can't stay in my house.

1062
01:18:41,394 --> 01:18:43,657
You must take her away
from here before tonight.

1063
01:18:43,677 --> 01:18:49,964
But not so soon, Countess.
Mr Mark is so tired. And she is so ill.

1064
01:18:50,396 --> 01:18:53,682
You must take her out of my house
or I'll have to notify the police.

1065
01:18:57,443 --> 01:19:00,213
Well, I do what I can.

1066
01:19:15,936 --> 01:19:17,212
Hello.

1067
01:19:17,383 --> 01:19:19,102
- Did I wake you?
- No!

1068
01:19:19,717 --> 01:19:24,515
As I left a car turned into your driveway.
A sort of a delivery truck.

1069
01:19:25,356 --> 01:19:26,266
Well?

1070
01:19:26,933 --> 01:19:30,233
Yes, I heard it, but it must
have turned around and gone on.

1071
01:19:30,402 --> 01:19:31,764
It didn't stop?

1072
01:19:32,596 --> 01:19:34,896
- No.
- Well that's all right then.

1073
01:19:34,916 --> 01:19:38,466
I was a little puzzled. It seemed so
strange, a delivery truck at that hour.

1074
01:19:39,243 --> 01:19:42,438
- You're sure everything's all right, hmm?
- Yes, of course.

1075
01:19:42,458 --> 01:19:46,766
- What are you doing now?
- Well, I was just going to get myself some coffee.

1076
01:19:47,055 --> 01:19:49,863
Good. Get some rest.
I'll see you tonight.

1077
01:19:50,419 --> 01:19:52,998
- All right.
- Goodbye, my dear.

1078
01:19:53,018 --> 01:19:54,342
Goodbye.

1079
01:20:03,778 --> 01:20:06,408
- The truck was seen coming in here.
- By...by whom?

1080
01:20:06,548 --> 01:20:10,455
I was just telephoned. You can't stay
here another instant. It's impossible.

1081
01:20:22,415 --> 01:20:23,299
Mother.

1082
01:20:25,586 --> 01:20:27,182
You're safe, mother.

1083
01:20:28,646 --> 01:20:30,606
There's nothing to worry about.

1084
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:32,787
Everything is all right.

1085
01:20:33,311 --> 01:20:34,778
You're going home.

1086
01:20:38,221 --> 01:20:40,643
- To Mark...
- Yes, Mother.

1087
01:20:44,622 --> 01:20:48,857
- You're in prison too?
- No, Mother, no, nobody's in the prison.

1088
01:20:52,164 --> 01:20:55,118
I never thought I'd see you again.

1089
01:20:59,779 --> 01:21:02,756
Now, now, just lie back down.

1090
01:21:26,738 --> 01:21:29,294
We'll keep the door locked.

1091
01:21:30,603 --> 01:21:34,610
- Did you say we?
- We must let her rest for a few hours.

1092
01:21:37,895 --> 01:21:39,653
You did say we.

1093
01:21:42,222 --> 01:21:43,385
Yes.

1094
01:21:46,733 --> 01:21:48,381
And now you must rest.

1095
01:21:48,401 --> 01:21:51,563
- I'm all right.
- Oh, you can't do everything yourself.

1096
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:54,571
- Who is the man who is helping you?
- Fritz.

1097
01:21:54,929 --> 01:21:57,005
He's arranging about the
funeral, the supposed funeral.

1098
01:21:57,025 --> 01:21:57,604
I see.

1099
01:21:57,624 --> 01:22:00,026
He also knows a man who
supplies forged passports.

1100
01:22:00,046 --> 01:22:00,910
Good.

1101
01:22:03,308 --> 01:22:05,534
We must get the girls out of the house.

1102
01:22:06,246 --> 01:22:09,579
Let me see now, I'll
send them skiing early.

1103
01:22:10,213 --> 01:22:13,443
And now you, please lie down
and try and get some sleep.

1104
01:22:23,339 --> 01:22:26,411
I just can't get it out
of my mind, madame.

1105
01:22:26,431 --> 01:22:30,725
There were all those strange noises.
My first thought was of the silver.

1106
01:22:30,745 --> 01:22:32,986
Julie, you read too many mystery novels.

1107
01:22:33,006 --> 01:22:36,156
But there was something, madame.
Somebody walking, as plain...

1108
01:22:36,176 --> 01:22:38,889
Julie, stop talking nonsense.

1109
01:22:39,607 --> 01:22:41,827
She's not talking nonsense.

1110
01:22:43,971 --> 01:22:47,229
There is something going on around here.
And I know what it is.

1111
01:22:49,209 --> 01:22:50,993
What are you talking about?

1112
01:22:51,988 --> 01:22:54,317
I'm talking about Maria.

1113
01:22:55,102 --> 01:22:59,891
Oh, yes, she has a cold, poor girl.
She won't be able to go skiing with the rest of you.

1114
01:23:00,796 --> 01:23:03,653
She's not sick.
She just doesnt want to go with us!

1115
01:23:04,344 --> 01:23:08,015
She was the one who was sneaking around
last night, down at the ice box!

1116
01:23:08,035 --> 01:23:10,654
That shows how sick she really is.

1117
01:23:12,298 --> 01:23:15,570
It's nothing to laugh about.
She doesn't belong here.

1118
01:23:15,590 --> 01:23:17,171
She doesn't think right!

1119
01:23:18,042 --> 01:23:20,641
Well, I hope she eats right.

1120
01:23:21,501 --> 01:23:24,409
- Julie, will you take this tray up to her?
- Yes, madame.

1121
01:23:24,545 --> 01:23:26,282
Didn't you hear me?

1122
01:23:26,517 --> 01:23:29,975
She was the one who was walking
around last night. I heard her!

1123
01:23:30,918 --> 01:23:32,691
Oh, please answer the door, dear.

1124
01:23:32,711 --> 01:23:35,894
Tell the driver you and the girls
will be ready to go in a few moments.

1125
01:23:36,140 --> 01:23:40,136
You won't listen to me.
You don't like me. You like her!

1126
01:23:40,156 --> 01:23:42,443
Ursula, don't talk nonsense.

1127
01:23:48,375 --> 01:23:51,752
- Hello, Ursula.
- Why, Your Excellency, come in.

1128
01:23:51,772 --> 01:23:53,005
Thank you.

1129
01:23:54,428 --> 01:23:56,882
Good afternoon, Your Excellency.

1130
01:23:56,902 --> 01:23:59,994
- What's this? Going away?
- Yes, we are. Isn't it wonderful?

1131
01:24:00,014 --> 01:24:02,839
- All the way up to the skiing lodge.
- So.

1132
01:24:02,952 --> 01:24:05,271
And we're going to stay
there all night too.

1133
01:24:05,684 --> 01:24:07,169
Ah, really?

1134
01:24:07,189 --> 01:24:12,261
- Look, Your Excellency. I have a new skiing jacket.
- Very nice. The Countess is going with you?

1135
01:24:13,324 --> 01:24:14,648
No, I'm not.

1136
01:24:16,103 --> 01:24:18,251
- Good afternoon, Countess.
- Good afternoon, General.

1137
01:24:19,758 --> 01:24:23,560
You'd better go finish your coffee, girls.
The driver ought to be here any moment.

1138
01:24:24,359 --> 01:24:28,153
- Won't you have some coffee with us, General?
- Yes, yes, I think I will.

1139
01:24:29,167 --> 01:24:31,617
So you are going to be quite alone, eh?

1140
01:24:33,009 --> 01:24:35,982
Well, girls, looking
forward to your skiing?

1141
01:24:36,002 --> 01:24:39,662
Why don't you come with us and teach
us how to really ski, Your Excellency?

1142
01:24:39,682 --> 01:24:43,142
I'm afraid His Excellency is much too
busy to become our skiing instructor.

1143
01:24:43,610 --> 01:24:45,542
But we should have a man with us.

1144
01:24:46,817 --> 01:24:47,764
Countess,

1145
01:24:47,862 --> 01:24:49,936
do you think there's any
chance of our running into

1146
01:24:49,956 --> 01:24:52,547
that handsome young American
in the mountains?

1147
01:24:53,149 --> 01:24:55,878
The American would look very
handsome in skiing clothes.

1148
01:24:56,661 --> 01:24:58,469
Don't you think so, Helene?

1149
01:25:00,871 --> 01:25:04,395
May I ask who is this young man?

1150
01:25:05,716 --> 01:25:07,681
Oh, no one of any importance.

1151
01:25:08,244 --> 01:25:10,216
You'd better get started now, girls.

1152
01:25:10,460 --> 01:25:12,330
The automobile isn't here yet.

1153
01:25:12,535 --> 01:25:13,709
Thank you.

1154
01:25:14,820 --> 01:25:18,647
You should have seen him up at the lake.
He's so handsome.

1155
01:25:19,049 --> 01:25:22,841
We girls just couldn't take our eyes off
him, while he was talking to the Countess.

1156
01:25:22,861 --> 01:25:23,796
Really?

1157
01:25:24,913 --> 01:25:29,212
Oh, yes, some friends told me you were at the
concert with a young man. Is it this one?

1158
01:25:29,655 --> 01:25:32,761
- Yes, I met him quite by accident.
- Do I know him?

1159
01:25:33,512 --> 01:25:35,802
I don't think so, no.
- His name?

1160
01:25:36,389 --> 01:25:38,873
Mr Preysing, I met him once in America.

1161
01:25:38,893 --> 01:25:43,111
- I think I know of a Mr Preysing.
- Emmy Ritter's son, hm?

1162
01:25:44,317 --> 01:25:45,935
I think so, yes.

1163
01:25:46,401 --> 01:25:50,617
- He has no friends here and...
- How kind of you to think of him.

1164
01:25:51,162 --> 01:25:53,550
No doubt he's lonely even now.

1165
01:25:53,977 --> 01:25:58,402
Wouldn't it be nice, girls, to have Mr
Preysing join us on a skiing party?

1166
01:25:59,711 --> 01:26:04,470
- You might even join us then, huh?
- I have no reason to see Mr Preysing again.

1167
01:26:05,199 --> 01:26:07,298
But have you any reason not to see him?

1168
01:26:07,318 --> 01:26:09,274
Why, I think it would be terribly amusing.

1169
01:26:09,294 --> 01:26:13,035
Well, there you are, your young ladies
would enjoy a younger man about.

1170
01:26:13,693 --> 01:26:16,701
And perhaps you would enjoy
a younger man yourself.

1171
01:26:18,743 --> 01:26:20,347
Come girls, it's getting quite late.

1172
01:26:20,367 --> 01:26:24,011
Oh, no, wait. You ought to
telephone the young man at once.

1173
01:26:25,234 --> 01:26:27,421
Don't you think this has gone far enough?

1174
01:26:27,441 --> 01:26:29,200
Where is Mr Preysing now?

1175
01:26:29,220 --> 01:26:32,115
- I don't know.
- That's easy enough to find out.

1176
01:26:32,495 --> 01:26:35,968
Ursula call the Hotel Excelsior in the
city or try the Inn in the village.

1177
01:26:35,988 --> 01:26:37,148
Yes, Your Excellency.

1178
01:26:37,345 --> 01:26:38,848
Ursula, wait.

1179
01:26:39,832 --> 01:26:41,653
Have you forgotten why he's here?

1180
01:26:41,762 --> 01:26:42,944
No.

1181
01:26:43,325 --> 01:26:45,550
But undoubtedly he has.

1182
01:26:46,248 --> 01:26:49,356
He needs to be reminded.
Ursula, telephone him.

1183
01:26:49,788 --> 01:26:50,952
All right.

1184
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:05,491
Operator, please get me the
Inn at the village. Yes.

1185
01:27:08,071 --> 01:27:11,986
Hello. Do you have a Mr
Preysing staying there?

1186
01:27:13,485 --> 01:27:16,480
You're sure? Thank you.

1187
01:27:18,606 --> 01:27:20,896
Operator. Operator!

1188
01:27:21,817 --> 01:27:24,577
Get me the Hotel Excelsior
in the city, please.

1189
01:27:25,173 --> 01:27:27,342
Yes, and hurry. Hurry, please.

1190
01:27:31,812 --> 01:27:35,996
Could you tell me if you have an American
by the name of Preysing staying there?

1191
01:27:36,888 --> 01:27:38,062
He's gone?

1192
01:27:38,442 --> 01:27:40,963
Oh, all right. Thank you.

1193
01:27:45,930 --> 01:27:47,715
Why, Mr Preysing!

1194
01:27:49,904 --> 01:27:52,359
- I was just trying to find you.
- Were you?

1195
01:27:52,379 --> 01:27:57,488
Oh, come in, come in. You certainly
picked the right time to visit us.

1196
01:27:57,671 --> 01:28:00,455
Look, I got him. Isn't that service?

1197
01:28:04,557 --> 01:28:08,067
- Mr Preysing.
- Just as I telephoned, he was coming in the door.

1198
01:28:08,731 --> 01:28:12,236
Yes, I didn't want to leave the
village without saying goodbye.

1199
01:28:12,656 --> 01:28:16,445
That's very kind of you.
Excellency, may I present Mr Preysing?

1200
01:28:17,786 --> 01:28:19,739
Mr Preysing, General Von Kolb.

1201
01:28:19,936 --> 01:28:21,354
How do you do.

1202
01:28:22,646 --> 01:28:26,721
This is really odd, Mr Preysing.
I was just talking about you.

1203
01:28:27,228 --> 01:28:31,161
- I wanted to meet you. Come in, Mr Preysing.
- Why, I'm sorry, I have an appointment.

1204
01:28:31,181 --> 01:28:35,341
Oh, no, no. The Countess'
invitations are not to be refused.

1205
01:28:35,925 --> 01:28:39,220
- Greta, take Mr Preysing's coat.
- I really can't stay.

1206
01:28:39,522 --> 01:28:41,738
Nonsense, we want you to.

1207
01:28:42,310 --> 01:28:44,808
- Don't we, Ruby?
- Yes, yes, of course.

1208
01:28:45,555 --> 01:28:47,790
Sit down, Mr Preysing, sit down.

1209
01:28:49,139 --> 01:28:52,510
Well, Ruby, aren't you going to
offer your friend some coffee?

1210
01:28:52,773 --> 01:28:53,981
No, thank you.

1211
01:28:54,176 --> 01:28:57,463
Something stronger, hm?
Some wine, Ruby.

1212
01:29:02,219 --> 01:29:06,162
Mr Preysing, has the purpose of
your visit been accomplished?

1213
01:29:06,496 --> 01:29:09,909
You did have a purpose in
visiting this country, I presume.

1214
01:29:10,768 --> 01:29:14,834
- Yes.
- No, no, no, put it here at my right, remember?

1215
01:29:29,762 --> 01:29:31,617
- There you are.
- No, thank you.

1216
01:29:31,941 --> 01:29:33,769
Now, that's a mistake.

1217
01:29:35,913 --> 01:29:38,434
Wine makes a man forget his troubles.

1218
01:29:38,617 --> 01:29:42,411
Or perhaps you have none.
Young and carefree, Mr Preysing?

1219
01:29:43,232 --> 01:29:45,117
You are carefree, aren't you?

1220
01:29:45,288 --> 01:29:46,659
Is anyone?

1221
01:29:47,260 --> 01:29:49,157
Ruby, where are my cigarettes?

1222
01:29:54,592 --> 01:29:58,329
My dear, you shouldn't wear that dress.
It washes you out. You look like a ghost.

1223
01:30:04,357 --> 01:30:06,188
Come now, it's only a spider.

1224
01:30:06,208 --> 01:30:07,784
Nothing to get excited about.

1225
01:30:07,804 --> 01:30:09,447
Spiders are not dangerous.

1226
01:30:09,915 --> 01:30:14,948
Mr Preysing, I once knew a lady
who had a tarantula as a pet.

1227
01:30:16,009 --> 01:30:18,956
I once new a tarantula who had a pet lady.

1228
01:30:19,582 --> 01:30:23,362
Mr Preysing, are you forgetting that
there are young ladies present?

1229
01:30:23,821 --> 01:30:26,909
Don't worry about the ladies.
They'll keep whatever pets they like.

1230
01:30:26,929 --> 01:30:30,325
Tarantulas or Pekinese, or even Generals.

1231
01:30:31,235 --> 01:30:32,568
What's that you say?

1232
01:30:32,588 --> 01:30:36,107
Who buys your uniform, your
gold braid, your saber?

1233
01:30:36,226 --> 01:30:38,751
Who pays for your motorcar
and your driver? Women.

1234
01:30:38,771 --> 01:30:41,541
They scrimp and save so
their men can pay taxes.

1235
01:30:41,879 --> 01:30:43,645
All over this country women are saving

1236
01:30:43,665 --> 01:30:46,859
carrot tops and potato peelings
just to keep a pet general.

1237
01:30:51,811 --> 01:30:57,155
Ruby, your friend has a
sense of humor. Yes.

1238
01:30:58,237 --> 01:30:59,542
Yes, get the whiskey.

1239
01:30:59,562 --> 01:31:01,015
We will drink a real toast

1240
01:31:01,035 --> 01:31:04,978
to Mr Preysing and his ingenious jokes.

1241
01:31:08,883 --> 01:31:13,006
Sit down, Mr Preysing.
We are enjoying your humor.

1242
01:31:13,175 --> 01:31:15,259
Sorry, I really must leave.

1243
01:31:15,954 --> 01:31:19,186
Ladies, if you'll excuse me, I'll
say goodbye to the Countess.

1244
01:31:24,334 --> 01:31:27,456
- I'm not going to leave you here.
- There's no time to talk about ourselves.

1245
01:31:27,476 --> 01:31:28,951
Tell me you'll come with us.

1246
01:31:29,236 --> 01:31:30,325
Say it!

1247
01:31:30,793 --> 01:31:33,762
- Say it.
- I'll be with you.

1248
01:31:37,572 --> 01:31:39,075
Ruby, have you forgotten the girls?

1249
01:31:39,095 --> 01:31:41,243
The car is here, they are
waiting to say goodbye.

1250
01:31:41,263 --> 01:31:43,263
Please excuse me, Mr Preysing.

1251
01:31:48,623 --> 01:31:50,595
I don't like you, Mr Preysing.

1252
01:31:51,047 --> 01:31:53,384
No?
Do you imagine I like you?

1253
01:31:53,404 --> 01:31:57,243
Unfortunately for you, I'm in a
position to enforce my dislikes.

1254
01:31:57,263 --> 01:32:00,672
- You must leave this country at once.
- How soon would you suggest?

1255
01:32:01,022 --> 01:32:02,308
Immediately.

1256
01:32:03,632 --> 01:32:05,199
I must try to do that.

1257
01:32:05,219 --> 01:32:07,279
You're not going to try.
You are going.

1258
01:32:09,177 --> 01:32:11,106
There's nothing more to keep you here.

1259
01:32:11,628 --> 01:32:14,037
This morning your mother was executed.

1260
01:32:14,635 --> 01:32:18,766
- You enjoy telling me that, don't you?
- And what are you going to do about it?

1261
01:32:20,046 --> 01:32:21,397
What can I do?

1262
01:32:21,417 --> 01:32:24,284
You take a great deal
from me, I wonder why?

1263
01:32:25,043 --> 01:32:29,475
I don't think I would take what you are
taking, not even in a strange country.

1264
01:32:30,582 --> 01:32:32,202
That's easy to say.

1265
01:32:34,602 --> 01:32:37,606
Come over to my backyard
some day and find out.

1266
01:32:42,423 --> 01:32:44,141
I shall, I promise.

1267
01:32:47,653 --> 01:32:49,793
- Goodbye, girls.
- Goodbye, Countess.

1268
01:32:49,813 --> 01:32:52,189
Julie, see that he doesn't
drive too fast, will you?

1269
01:32:52,209 --> 01:32:52,977
Yes, madame.

1270
01:32:52,997 --> 01:32:55,629
- Goodbye, madame.
- Goodbye, Countess.

1271
01:32:55,649 --> 01:32:58,786
- Goodbye, Mr Preysing.
- I'm sorry if I've caused you any trouble.

1272
01:33:01,168 --> 01:33:03,873
- Kurt.
- I'd rather not talk to you now.

1273
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:08,464
I might say something which
both of us would regret.

1274
01:33:21,136 --> 01:33:25,720
Not many turned out.
I'm glad Madame Ritter wasn't in that box.

1275
01:33:26,227 --> 01:33:31,295
She would be so angry to draw such a
small audience at her last appearance.

1276
01:33:45,030 --> 01:33:47,941
- Is everything all right?
- Oh, yes.

1277
01:33:48,626 --> 01:33:50,199
Where's Mr Preysing?

1278
01:33:50,748 --> 01:33:51,880
Mr Mark.

1279
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:56,161
Has he been here or phoned?

1280
01:33:56,660 --> 01:33:59,626
- No, that's why I'm worried.
- He mustn't find her in your house.

1281
01:33:59,646 --> 01:34:01,174
We've gotta get out of here, now.
All of us.

1282
01:34:01,194 --> 01:34:02,984
Fritz, you park the truck up at the side road.
We'll be upstairs.

1283
01:34:03,004 --> 01:34:04,584
You get your things packed.

1284
01:34:14,648 --> 01:34:15,622
Mother.

1285
01:34:16,300 --> 01:34:17,239
Mother.

1286
01:34:25,268 --> 01:34:26,056
Oh...

1287
01:34:27,492 --> 01:34:28,535
Mark.

1288
01:34:30,390 --> 01:34:31,385
Darling...

1289
01:34:32,493 --> 01:34:34,108
do you think you can get up?

1290
01:34:34,128 --> 01:34:36,174
Well, of course.

1291
01:34:40,714 --> 01:34:43,097
No more truck rides, I hope.

1292
01:34:43,117 --> 01:34:45,221
Mother, there's still a lot ahead of us.

1293
01:34:46,416 --> 01:34:50,444
- You mean crossing the border?
- No, that'll come later.

1294
01:34:50,819 --> 01:34:51,758
Later?

1295
01:34:52,823 --> 01:34:54,589
Couldn't get a passport.

1296
01:34:55,387 --> 01:34:57,810
- Then you can't leave the country.
- We'll go somewhere.

1297
01:34:58,121 --> 01:34:59,051
But where?

1298
01:34:59,163 --> 01:35:01,530
Don't you worry about that, now.
We've gotta get out of here.

1299
01:35:01,605 --> 01:35:04,336
But why? Why tonight?

1300
01:35:05,519 --> 01:35:09,519
Well, you see, mother, there's
someone who might cause us a little

1301
01:35:09,539 --> 01:35:10,353
Wait!

1302
01:35:11,913 --> 01:35:13,481
I'll get you a passport.

1303
01:35:24,423 --> 01:35:25,625
Marion.

1304
01:35:26,579 --> 01:35:28,029
Marion, please.

1305
01:35:28,521 --> 01:35:30,786
Oh, I'm so sorry to have to waken you.

1306
01:35:31,272 --> 01:35:34,323
- Can you understand what I say?
- Yes, madame.

1307
01:35:34,797 --> 01:35:37,186
- Do you feel better?
- Yes.

1308
01:35:37,482 --> 01:35:38,914
What is it, madame?

1309
01:35:39,141 --> 01:35:42,540
I have a great favor to ask of you.
I ask it because I must.

1310
01:35:43,460 --> 01:35:44,841
What is it?

1311
01:35:45,122 --> 01:35:47,154
I want you to lend me your passport.

1312
01:35:47,599 --> 01:35:49,214
- Passport?
- Yes.

1313
01:35:49,459 --> 01:35:50,734
But, madame, I...

1314
01:35:51,111 --> 01:35:53,856
My passport, if I give it up,
there'd be such trouble.

1315
01:35:53,876 --> 01:35:56,262
It's to help someone who
needs our help very much.

1316
01:35:56,282 --> 01:35:59,556
Someone who believes
as I think you do.

1317
01:36:01,583 --> 01:36:04,550
Is it something to do with the American?

1318
01:36:06,156 --> 01:36:07,283
Take it.

1319
01:36:26,737 --> 01:36:28,201
How do I look?

1320
01:36:29,663 --> 01:36:32,647
- It's really wonderful.
- That makes me feel good, madame.

1321
01:36:32,667 --> 01:36:34,696
We are back in show business.

1322
01:36:37,228 --> 01:36:38,806
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

1323
01:36:38,826 --> 01:36:41,740
- It's good, but is it good enough?
- Oh, listen to him!

1324
01:36:42,017 --> 01:36:43,960
He's as bad as a Philadelphia critic.

1325
01:36:43,980 --> 01:36:47,176
Your bad notices were in
Boston, not in Philadelphia.

1326
01:36:47,196 --> 01:36:48,917
Well, let's hope they
don't look too closely.

1327
01:36:48,937 --> 01:36:50,493
- You ready, Mother?
- Yes, yes, darling.

1328
01:36:50,513 --> 01:36:51,903
- Wait a minute!
- What is it?

1329
01:36:51,923 --> 01:36:52,823
Luggage.

1330
01:36:52,843 --> 01:36:55,421
No, no, yours will be enough in case
anyone at the airport gets suspicious.

1331
01:36:55,441 --> 01:36:56,464
Well, ah...

1332
01:36:56,484 --> 01:36:57,638
you better have more.

1333
01:36:57,658 --> 01:36:59,658
You'll find some suitcases in the
closet at the head of the stairs.

1334
01:36:59,678 --> 01:37:02,108
- Please be ready, both of you.
- Come on, Fritz.

1335
01:37:05,919 --> 01:37:09,257
- Your passport is in your bag.
- Oh, thank you.

1336
01:37:10,036 --> 01:37:11,040
All set.

1337
01:37:11,319 --> 01:37:14,014
It takes 15 minutes to get to the airport.
The plane leaves at 9 o'clock.

1338
01:37:14,034 --> 01:37:16,549
21 minutes of nine.
21 minutes to freedom.

1339
01:37:16,766 --> 01:37:18,221
You any small luggage?

1340
01:37:18,897 --> 01:37:21,053
If you please, Madame Ritter.

1341
01:37:22,224 --> 01:37:24,082
What happened?
Why aren't you ready to go?

1342
01:37:24,102 --> 01:37:26,604
- Mark, I've thought it over.
- No, no, you're going.

1343
01:37:26,624 --> 01:37:29,617
- I can't go. Not now.
- Do you love that man, is that it?

1344
01:37:29,637 --> 01:37:31,505
- I can't leave him.
- But you can.

1345
01:37:31,525 --> 01:37:34,166
He'd never rest until he uncovered
everybody connected with this.

1346
01:37:34,186 --> 01:37:37,355
- Oh, that doctor who helped me.
- Yes, and Fritz too, they'd be tortured.

1347
01:37:37,375 --> 01:37:39,943
He'd see to that.
He can be unbelievably cruel.

1348
01:37:41,064 --> 01:37:43,100
If you know that about him,
then you don't love him.

1349
01:37:43,120 --> 01:37:44,594
But there's so much else, Mark, it...

1350
01:37:45,421 --> 01:37:47,227
it isn't as simple as that.

1351
01:37:48,675 --> 01:37:50,253
What are you trying to say?

1352
01:37:50,619 --> 01:37:52,412
I'm trying to say...

1353
01:37:53,351 --> 01:37:55,013
I'm trying to tell you that...

1354
01:37:57,258 --> 01:37:59,361
- That you love me.
- Oh, Mark.

1355
01:37:59,610 --> 01:38:00,849
But you do.

1356
01:38:01,629 --> 01:38:05,130
- Hold me.
- No past, no regrets.

1357
01:38:06,248 --> 01:38:09,030
Just you and I beginning right now.

1358
01:38:11,410 --> 01:38:14,525
- If I can only come to you later.
- You can.

1359
01:38:14,545 --> 01:38:15,441
Mr Mark!

1360
01:38:15,461 --> 01:38:17,086
And now you must hurry.

1361
01:38:19,340 --> 01:38:22,993
- When will it be safe for you to leave?
- I don't know, Mark, but soon.

1362
01:38:23,368 --> 01:38:24,561
It had better be.

1363
01:38:24,581 --> 01:38:25,706
Mr Mark!

1364
01:38:28,250 --> 01:38:32,079
Mr Mark, there's a car coming
with two soldiers in front.

1365
01:38:37,503 --> 01:38:40,230
In here, quickly.
Go out the back door.

1366
01:38:40,427 --> 01:38:42,718
Stay close to the hedge
and you won't be seen.

1367
01:38:43,670 --> 01:38:47,114
- Hurry, you can just make it.
- I'll be waiting on 57th Street.

1368
01:38:47,134 --> 01:38:48,984
Yes, Mark, yes, hurry.

1369
01:39:00,072 --> 01:39:04,119
Why, Kurt, I didn't expect you so early.
I'm glad you came.

1370
01:39:10,071 --> 01:39:13,771
Kurt, it's been such a long day.
It isn't 9 yet and it seems like 24 hours...

1371
01:39:15,359 --> 01:39:18,981
Kurt, if you're worried about Mr Preysing,
he's gone, and he shan't return.

1372
01:39:20,567 --> 01:39:22,621
Oh, well, all right, Kurt.

1373
01:39:25,093 --> 01:39:28,201
Emmy Ritter died suddenly
in prison on Friday night.

1374
01:39:30,306 --> 01:39:31,818
Oh, how sad.

1375
01:39:31,838 --> 01:39:33,288
But not sad for her son, was it?

1376
01:39:33,308 --> 01:39:35,945
Or was it great sorrow which
brought him here yesterday?

1377
01:39:36,100 --> 01:39:39,245
- Well, perhaps he didn't know.
- He buried her himself.

1378
01:39:42,377 --> 01:39:44,874
Perhaps he thought she was better off.
After all she...

1379
01:39:44,894 --> 01:39:48,744
- Stop these lies, Ruby.
- Kurt, please don't talk to me like that.

1380
01:39:51,442 --> 01:39:55,639
How they have used you, Preysing, your friend
Dr Ditten, the old servant Fritz Keller.

1381
01:39:55,659 --> 01:40:01,007
- Ruby, Emmy Ritter's in this house, isn't she?
- In this house? Really, Kurt.

1382
01:40:01,174 --> 01:40:05,515
- I had no idea you had such an imagination.
- Don't, Ruby. It's quite useless, she's here.

1383
01:40:05,535 --> 01:40:06,461
Is she?

1384
01:40:06,819 --> 01:40:09,513
Then there's only one thing to do.
Search the house.

1385
01:40:09,983 --> 01:40:13,195
You fool. I don't want her found in this house.
I want to protect you.

1386
01:40:13,307 --> 01:40:15,223
Well then, Kurt. Search it yourself.

1387
01:40:18,676 --> 01:40:21,014
So, she isn't here. Good.

1388
01:40:22,305 --> 01:40:24,051
- What are you going to do?
- I'm going to call the police...

1389
01:40:24,071 --> 01:40:26,155
Every road, every station,
every airport must be watched.

1390
01:40:26,175 --> 01:40:27,834
Do you wanna be made ridiculous.

1391
01:40:27,854 --> 01:40:30,924
Do you want people to say well where is this
resurrected woman and then laugh at you?

1392
01:40:30,944 --> 01:40:33,405
- You don't like to be laughed at, Kurt.
- I'll risk that.

1393
01:40:33,425 --> 01:40:38,280
All right. You win. I'm not clever.
Not nearly as clever as you are.

1394
01:40:39,209 --> 01:40:42,593
What if you won?
The death of a woman?

1395
01:40:44,103 --> 01:40:46,470
You're strong, Kurt.
But this woman is weak. She...

1396
01:40:46,490 --> 01:40:48,236
She only has a few more years to live.

1397
01:40:48,256 --> 01:40:49,767
Why not let her have them?

1398
01:40:50,105 --> 01:40:52,790
Let her have sunshine
and happiness in life.

1399
01:40:52,900 --> 01:40:56,626
We've had it. Let's reach down this once
and share it with someone who needs it.

1400
01:40:56,815 --> 01:40:59,342
Your interest in his
mother is very touching.

1401
01:40:59,953 --> 01:41:03,125
But it would have come better before you
had tried to trick me and lied to me...

1402
01:41:03,145 --> 01:41:06,821
as you are lying now. You're not pleading for
the mother, you're pleading for the son.

1403
01:41:06,841 --> 01:41:09,726
Then, when they arrest me, what then?

1404
01:41:11,085 --> 01:41:14,794
- You're getting out of the country now.
- Oh, no, Kurt, no. I'm staying.

1405
01:41:15,681 --> 01:41:17,822
You will have to arrest me, won't you?

1406
01:41:19,033 --> 01:41:22,281
Yes, it will be my... my duty.

1407
01:41:27,463 --> 01:41:31,191
Of course. Nothing must
interfere with your duty.

1408
01:41:31,716 --> 01:41:36,400
You're a hero, Kurt. First you must kill
this woman, and then there'll be my trial.

1409
01:41:36,588 --> 01:41:39,518
Imagine what it will be like.
You and I and all of our friends watching.

1410
01:41:39,621 --> 01:41:43,638
How they'll stare at us, at me.
They'll say there's the woman who
betrayed him for the sake of another man.

1411
01:41:43,658 --> 01:41:45,291
- A young man!
- Stop!

1412
01:41:45,311 --> 01:41:48,071
Oh, you think I'm so shy and timid, don't you?
But I tell you won't be.

1413
01:41:48,353 --> 01:41:52,212
I'll say everything I can think of. I'll tell them
you're crazy and that you're accusing my friends...

1414
01:41:52,232 --> 01:41:56,906
because you're insane with jealousy. A half mad, sick
creature who should be in a hospital, not in the army.

1415
01:41:56,926 --> 01:41:59,191
I'll tell them I loathe their
country and everyone in it.

1416
01:41:59,211 --> 01:42:01,760
That I'd betray it over and
over if I had the chance.

1417
01:42:01,780 --> 01:42:05,903
I'll make them cruel to me, do fearful things to me
and you'll have to be there and watch them do it.

1418
01:42:06,494 --> 01:42:08,108
You'll do what you must.

1419
01:42:09,415 --> 01:42:11,630
I'll do what I must.

1420
01:42:11,650 --> 01:42:13,640
This is General Von Kolb.

1421
01:42:21,758 --> 01:42:22,800
Kurt.

1422
01:42:27,230 --> 01:42:27,997
Hello.

1423
01:42:28,977 --> 01:42:29,681
Hello.

1424
01:42:30,122 --> 01:42:30,875
Hello!

1425
01:42:31,897 --> 01:42:32,704
Hello.

1426
01:42:42,331 --> 01:42:43,993
I did what I had to.

1427
01:42:45,166 --> 01:42:46,284
Ruby...

1428
01:42:47,612 --> 01:42:52,088
- don't leave me now.
- No, Kurt.

1429
01:42:57,980 --> 01:43:00,263
I won't leave you now.
