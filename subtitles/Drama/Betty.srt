1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,000
Previously on ugly betty

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,820
Bradford thinks this wife
isn't really a monster.

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:06,820
Let's show him what she's capable of.

4
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,480
I can't believe she had this done to you.

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,020
That was just so horrible.

6
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,130
I'm divorcing Claire!

7
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,220
I heard you might be able
to help me with the problem.

8
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,660
I needed it eliminated.

9
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:16,780
I'm so sorry.

10
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:17,870
I love you.

11
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:19,820
He's my boyfriend.

12
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,870
You sleep with women to distract yourself 
from what's going on in your life.

13
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,090
This is little something
i found overseas.

14
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:26,670
Where did you get that jacket?

15
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,210
A new up-and-coming designer--Tavares.

16
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:31,900
And when we're alone,
you're straight,and I'm naked.

17
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,210
My father is being sent back
to Mexico to wait for his visa.

18
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,650
Okay!Everybody!They just called.

19
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,370
The taxi is gonna be
here in five minutes.

20
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:49,960
I'm okay!

21
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:53,580
This trip cannot be
happening at a worse time.

22
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,250
Doesn't anyone care that i am
understudying the lead-in "west side story"?

23
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:02,860
God forbid Joey Colano takes ill and I
don't know my finger snaps for the rumble.

24
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:06,210
Justin we'll only be in mexico
long enough for grandpa to get his visa.

25
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:07,780
You hardly will miss anything.

26
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:11,410
Beside we'll gonna meet all our
familly members and practice our spanish.

27
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,440
Ola Comi atu Sorina.

28
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,730
You just said "i ate your niece".

29
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,350
Come on, Justin,help me please.

30
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:22,300
Hilda! Valmu mus!

31
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:25,220
Hey don't forget to ask your
cousin about the reception hall.

32
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,550
No! Santos we talked about
this,you are in charge of that.

33
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,240
Look,I gotta go, okay? I love you

34
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,620
Ok, bye.

35
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,610
Thank god, man! I gave him one
job,he just pull all that upon on me.

36
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:40,710
Hey! maybe we can find you
a wedding dressin mexico

37
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,490
The dress! Where am i
gonna find the dress?

38
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:46,250
When am I going to find the time
to do all of this stuff!

39
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,350
Oh maybe it's about the cake.

40
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,120
No more calls, Hilda,we are late.

41
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,990
Hi Betty.

42
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:51,980
- It's Henry.
- Henry.

43
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:55,380
It's me, Henry,i know you are kind of nervous
about the flying for the first time.

44
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,110
- So pick it up
- No

45
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:01,630
you have a far greater risk of dying driving to the airport
than actually being on the plane.

46
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:05,560
If you are hearing this then you
haven't droven to the airport yet.

47
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,750
So nevermind, adios, have a good trip.

48
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,760
That is so sweet.

49
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,810
And so gigi. Why don't you pick up?

50
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:17,040
Because, Hilda, I'm done with henry.

51
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:21,660
He has a girl friend I know what's meant
to be and it wouldn't really be this hard.

52
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,440
Whatever.

53
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,270
Message deleted.

54
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,260
OK. What's the one market we
are still not have been into yet?

55
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:43,270
Anyone? Sigle... young... man.

56
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,820
Well,we are a fashion magzine.

57
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:48,560
Exactly! Guys don't give a damn about our
clothes. What are they really care about? Huh?

58
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,090
Beer? Girls? Right? Guys want girls.

59
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:55,770
Girls that are accessible,girls
they think they can get.

60
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:58,230
We need to get those kind
of girls in this magzine.

61
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:01,700
And listen,they don't
have to be ugly,nor fat,

62
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:06,540
*** very good-looking,hot,and wear
really nice clothes,too,You know what I mean?

63
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:13,510
Uh,What you are saying is we should put thin pretty
women wearing nice outfits in this fashion magzine?

64
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:16,230
Exactly! You know,there
was something else.

65
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:20,970
OK,well, while Deniel is trying to remember
what the hell he is talking about,let's move on to...

66
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:24,140
Don't do that to me. You are
not the only one in charge.

67
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,760
But I'm the one with pupils that
are not the size of the quarters.

68
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,290
OK,girls,Tuck 'em back in,
you are both big.

69
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:36,970
Now,let's talk about the fearless women
feature. We've managed to secure... Jordan Dunn

70
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:40,620
Jordan Dunn? No. No,no,no,no.
That's not a very good idea.

71
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,390
That's a fabulous idea.
She hang-glides,she ice-climbs,

72
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:48,090
she swam the English channel in
a leather bikini,we've already have the title--

73
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:49,840
"the Dare Devil Wears Prada".

74
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,730
I said "NO"!

75
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:56,670
You know what? This meeting is done.

76
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:59,710
Thanks to Deniel,we've gone way over.

77
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,960
That was a... little bizzare?

78
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,250
That was amazing.

79
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:11,310
See,Jordan Don was Alex's girl friend before he became
a "she". I'm guessing they haven't seen each other since.

80
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:15,420
Your boyfreind faked as death
and come back as a very big girl.

81
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,080
That really isn't a coward for that.

82
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:21,480
Do not cancel that meeting.
It's gonna be awesome.

83
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,400
Yes! High five! Come on! Come on.

84
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,800
We did not just high five him.

85
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:31,680
Willie,you are smiling,laugh lines.

86
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:38,760
Oh,OK. Today is a good day,the brothers are fighting,
and Bradford sent the divorce papers in a mail.

87
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,780
And that much close to be
coming the next... Ms. Meade.

88
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,160
You,really can't see
those lines,can you?

89
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,760
No. You know, it's deadly on the outside
as you are on the inside.

90
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,120
Deniel,I'm on the plane.

91
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,090
Thank you so much for the tickets.
First class totally rocks.

92
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:13,430
I've tried lobsters and I watched wild
hogs,I think John Travolta looks better on a plane.

93
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,930
So how is Temp working out?

94
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:18,730
Fine,I guess Amber wasn't available huh?

95
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:23,330
Deniel, Amber couldn't type,or use a
pen. And she got lost on the elevator.

96
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:25,150
yeah,but she was hot.

97
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,740
Ellen was Miss Subway 1949.

98
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,940
So how are you? Is everything OK?

99
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,870
- Betty,I'm good.
- Are you sure?

100
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:34,390
You know this call?
Costs like, 10 bucks a minute?

101
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:44,680
Yes,yes,no,

102
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,330
burn it,burn it and bury it. oh,oh,Oh.

103
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:50,750
Is it good or bad?

104
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,050
I don't know,she is never
using the triple "oh".

105
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:53,690
It's bad.

106
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:59,150
Tavers,I'm sure you thought putting coconut
shell buttons on this jacket was adventurous,

107
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,380
But you've just murdered a blazer.

108
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,440
Murderer.

109
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,510
I was going for
something new,you know--

110
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:07,910
well,don'T. I don't want any
embarrassments at your debut.

111
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:10,580
- Fix it by tomorrow night.
- Coconut shell buttons?

112
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,880
You might as well havepunched
her in the stomach.

113
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:17,020
Okay,did that go
well,or does she hate me?

114
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,350
Are you kidding me?

115
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:21,640
She's bringingall the new york
buyers to your studiotomorrow night.

116
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,620
You're gonna be a wilhel
mina slater discovery,

117
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,750
and because I hooked you up,you have
to make out with me in the ladies' room.

118
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,970
shh!I'm supposed to be a big 'mo.

119
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:32,450
I tried being straight in
thisbusiness,and it doesn't work.

120
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,350
So unfair.

121
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:37,370
I finally got a hot boyfriend.

122
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:40,530
I can't even use it to make all the
other slutsfeel bad about themselves.

123
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,830
Guess I'll just make
that upto you later then.

124
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:48,500
Hey,hey,hey,girlie bag. That
top is love.Missoni or cavalli?

125
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,670
Yeah,I'm not doing thatwith you.

126
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,650
Keep the cham-plane coming.

127
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,910
Yeah.

128
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:02,390
Thank you.

129
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,380
Oh,papi. Papi.

130
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:09,330
Tell 'em that you didn't getyour complimentary travel kit,'cause
if I get another,then I can use them as bridesmaids' gifts.

131
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:12,090
- Here.You can have mine.
- Oh,no,you keep yours.

132
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,620
- You're my maid of honor.
- Oh,thank you.

133
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:19,620
Um,okay,so fernando,your
cousin,married natalia,

134
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,200

135
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,920
- That's right.
- Yes!Okay.

136
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,900
God,I just hate it that there's
no oneon mom's side of the chart.

137
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,320
I can't help you there,sweetheart.

138
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:34,280
I never really knew
aboutanybody except your mother.

139
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,670
Well,what year did grandma die?

140
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,940
I don't know,betty.Sometime
after hilda was born.

141
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,230
Mom never eventalked about her.

142
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,700
I mean,there mustbe
somebody who knows--

143
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,670
betty,concentrateon
the people we do know.

144
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:50,640
Okay. I-I

145
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:53,380
dad,are you okay?

146
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,980
I'm sorry,mija.

147
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,180
I guess I might be a
littlenervous about going home.

148
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,890
I didn't exactly leaveunder
the best circumstances.

149
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:04,170
So they don't know you
killed mom's husband?

150
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:06,020
- Ow!
- what,are you crazy?

151
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,310
Somebody's gonna hear you.

152
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:11,460
Nobody knows anything exceptyou
girls and my sister mirta.

153
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:14,000
Now can we please
stoptalking about this?

154
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,120
Betty,you're missing an earring.

155
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,340
What?

156
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,680
Oh,no!

157
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,120
My "dias" from my
"buenos dias" earrings.

158
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,700
I knew I shouldn't
havebrought my good jewelry.

159
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:27,600
You know,I know thisis the worst thing
to mix withyour cholesterol medication,

160
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,720
but I think a celebrationis in order.

161
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,380
Willie,I havea confession to make.

162
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:36,070
You didn't sign the papers?

163
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:41,270
Are you forgetting she
hired thugs to beat me?

164
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,650
- That she's a murderer?
- Wilhelmina.

165
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:48,560
oh,sorry.It's just this injury.

166
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:51,180
They say I'll have to
learnto live with it.

167
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:54,530
Willie,I have been marriedto
claire for so many years.

168
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,850
How do you juststart your life over?

169
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:02,200
Claire was a very,very toxic woman. I
could understandhow you feel a bit drained.

170
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:07,000
When I met claire,I
was... brad meade--

171
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:10,830
young,ambitious,felt
I could do anything.

172
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:13,680
Well,you still can. You just
have to get outin the world again.

173
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,380
I'm gonna take you to a
party tomorrow,downtown.

174
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,300
Party? Oh,I don't know.

175
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,610
You just needto shake things up a bit.

176
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:23,680
Buy a new car.Get a new look.

177
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,290
Oh,trust me,I can help
youfind "brad" again.

178
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:43,350
luis y natalia.

179
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,550
Y... um,armando.

180
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,480
No.

181
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,200
- E... ernesto.
- No.

182
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,650
Oh. Yo soy,uh,muy embarazada.

183
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,710
You just told them you're pregnant.

184
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:54,800
Fantastico!

185
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,480
No. Baby?No.

186
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:01,650
I know exactlywhat I want my dress to look
like in my head,but I can't find it anywhere.

187
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,690
And you feel likeyou're
running out of time.

188
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:06,800
Yeah,it's crazy,right? I
mean,there's plenty of time.

189
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,730
No,there isn'T.It's gonna go by like
that,and you're gonna end upwith nothing.

190
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:14,610
Oh! don't cry,mirta.

191
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,230
Why shouldn't I cry?

192
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:20,930
I haven't seenmy little
brother in 30 years.

193
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:25,490
I would like to saythat you look the
same,but you look like an old man.

194
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:28,190
Well,that meansI'm old,too.

195
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,420
- Is that why you're crying?
- Yeah.

196
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:34,210
oh,look at my son.Isn't he handsome?

197
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,750
Did you meet his wife?

198
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,780
Oh,yes.She cannot have a baby.

199
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:44,380
a cyst on one of her ovaries.

200
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,390
Now,mirta,go easy.

201
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:50,400
You know how you talk
too much when you drink.

202
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,540
Don't you worry. I've never
told anyone  your secrets.

203
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:56,420
My god. You are gray.

204
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,840
How gray am I?Don't tell me.

205
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,340
Look at you!You're so skinny!

206
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,080
You're the third
personwho's told me that.

207
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,940
oh,my god. I love it here.

208
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:11,070
okay,who is that old
womanthat keeps staring at us?

209
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,770
Oh. Isabella.

210
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,130
I forgot who she's related
to,but she's a curandera.

211
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:17,670
What's a curandera?

212
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:20,680
She's a healer. Very powerful.

213
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,710
That woman knows things,and
she can do things.

214
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:27,180
My husband miguelhad a wart on his hand.

215
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,660
She touched it.The next day,it was gone.

216
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:32,630
Wow. Well,maybe she couldhelp
you with your ovaries.

217
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:35,710
Ay,when that mirta drinks,she'll
tell anybody anything. Mirta!

218
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,460
Tenemos que hablar!
(We have to talk!)

219
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:39,770
Oops.

220
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:42,940
Um,hello.

221
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:46,710
T?ser*s infeliz por el resto de tu vida.

222
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,480
Did she just sayI'm gonna be unhappy?

223
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,140
Yeah,for the rest of your life.

224
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,100
Por qu?
(Why?)

225
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:55,920
Nunca conoceras felicidad
por que est*s estancada.

226
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,790
I-I'm--I'm
sorry.I-I...

227
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:59,890
- es muy triste,pero...
- m-m-m*s r*pido.

228
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:01,980
- You just told herto talk faster.
- no!

229
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:03,750
No mas rapido!

230
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:06,030
Hilda,what--what
is she saying?

231
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,870
Uh,she's sayingthat--that--that
you're stuck,

232
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:10,570
and that you can't move
forwarduntil you look back.

233
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:12,710
- De un arbol.
- Uh,oh,but there's hope.

234
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:15,580
She--she
sees a tree.

235
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,530
- Un arbol grande.
- A tree?

236
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,820
Yeah,a treewith missing branches.

237
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,530
La solucio es detras del arbol.

238
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:26,210
Debe buscar detr*s del arbol.

239
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:28,810
And the answeris behind the tree.

240
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:31,170
Uh... what does that mean?

241
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:34,230
it means the woman's nuts. A
minute ago,she was eating a candle.

242
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,370
okay. Thank you.

243
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:39,500
Gracias. Good-bye,mrs.Crazy.

244
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,360
Adios.

245
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,230
It's not on the plane.

249
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,180
hilda,I knowwhat the curandera meant.

250
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:39,860
The tree--it--it's the family
tree,and the empty branches--

251
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:44,280
that's--that's mom's sideof the
family. It's,like,so obvious.

252
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:48,710
She wants me... to fill
inmom's side of the tree.

253
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,720
Or you could climb
itwith those toenails.

254
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,100
Good morning,betty.

255
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,540
that's,uh,that's a lot of metal.

256
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,310
you want some coffee?

257
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:06,040
Aunt mirta,you knew my mother,right?

258
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:09,410
Oh,you lookso much like her.

259
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,570
She and I were very close.

260
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:16,790
She used to call mefrom new york
city,and we would talkabout everything.

261
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:19,120
Then--then you must
knowabout her family.

262
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,760
D-do you think that maybeyou could help
me fill out her side of the family tree?

263
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,730
Oh,no,no,no,no,no.I don't
know nothing about that.

264
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,450
No,she never talked about
them.I'll get you coffee.

265
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:34,580
nick,I'm busy.Whatever
it is,it can wait.

266
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:37,740
I've already waitedtwo years.

267
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,610
Hello,alex.

268
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:41,990
Jordan.

269
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:45,310
You look... different. New haircut?

270
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,980
Oh,hey,sugar booger.

271
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,540
So we'll go to my placeright after
work,and that'll give usplenty of time to--

272
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:58,830
don't tell me you forgotwe were gonna rent "300"
and enjoy the mildlyhomophobic/homoerotic content.

273
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:01,370
I'm sorry.It's tavares' party.

274
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:03,320
Of course. Tavares.

275
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:07,860
Clearly,you've replaced mewith that african
queen. Looks likeI'm yester-gay's news.

276
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:11,210
Okay,you're hurt.I am hearing that.

277
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,940
Anyway,you wanna goto the party?

278
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,480
- why would i want to do that?
- There'll be cute boys there.

279
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,500
Okay,I'm a littlemore
interested. Work harder.

280
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,300
You have to come,and
this is not just for me.

281
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,400
You are having,like,the
best hair day ever.

282
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,180
well-played,but just so you
know,I'll be bringing my own hag.

283
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,490
Or should I say haggis?

284
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:34,430
Polish off your best kilt,C.
We're going to a party.

285
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:36,250
Oh,sod off.

286
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:41,370
still finding our rhythm.

287
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:47,230
If you thinkthis is awkward,I
almost worethe same outfit.

288
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,530
Wow.

289
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,590
That reallyis you in there.

290
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:56,010
- Jordan,I know you must hate me.
- I did.

291
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,610
I'm a tough girl.

292
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:01,150
I got over it,

293
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:05,960
and I guess that this explains
a lotabout our relationship,

294
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:09,530
like why you neverleft
the toilet seat up.

295
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,740
- I wanted to tell you.
- I know,

296
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:14,760
but that would meanyou'd
have to say good-bye, and...

297
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,180
that was never one
of your talents, alex.

298
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,810
I'm so sorry.

299
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,420
It's okay.

300
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,540
This is whoyou're supposed to be.

301
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,610
And by the way...

302
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:29,410
- the boobs are amazing.
- Thanks.

303
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,770
They're yours. I took a
pictureof you to the surgeon.

304
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:34,890
The nose is kate winslet'S.

305
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,620
Oh,yeah.

306
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:39,120
Wow.

307
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,720
You really got marriedin this?

308
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,960
Oh,and I felt likea fairy princess.

309
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,230
But what color was
leftfor the bridesmaids?

310
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,760
Oh,there was no wayshe could wear white.

311
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,310
You're on thin ice,lady.

312
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,460
wow. That'S... fancy.

313
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:00,840
You know,I was thinkingthat maybe I would
just go a little bitmore traditional,you know,

314
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,780
like,um,one--one
or two colors.

315
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,400
Okay,but it's a wedding,not a funeral.

316
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:08,750
Ay,come on. I have two more.

317
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,070
Oh. Two more. Fabulous.

318
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,980
Let's havesome of your ponche.

319
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:17,550
Oh.Oh,no,no,no. Betty,I
had too much last night.

320
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:20,860
Oh,but it's so good,and--and
we'restill celebrating.

321
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:23,160
That's true. Salud.

322
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,110
Drink up.

323
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,180
Jordan!

324
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,990
- Hey,beautiful!
- Hi,daniel.

325
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,150
energy.

326
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:38,660
You look amazing.Wait
till alexis sees you.

327
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:41,870
Uh,he... she already has.

328
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,770
That's hard to get used to.

329
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:45,660
Oh,was it bad?How bad was it?

330
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:49,050
It was... weird,but I
think it's gonna be okay.

331
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,440
Good. Great.

332
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,560
God,I haven'tseen you in forever. I wish that we
could hang out,but I'm doing a shootfor you guys--

333
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,150
bungee jumping off the
brooklyn bridge--kid stuff.

334
00:17:59,150 --> 00:17:59,770
Right.

335
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:01,760
- I want to see you later,okay?
- Okay.

336
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,120
Yeah. Hey.

337
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,700
I wanna come.I wanna jump with you.

338
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,200
- Really?
- Yeah.

339
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,090
I thoughtyour sport was women.

340
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:15,570
I like to get my kicksin other ways,too.

341
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,360
- Okay.Come.
- Great.

342
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:22,350
But I know howyou and alex are. Do you
think that thisis gonna bother him--her?

343
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,000
Probably.

344
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:32,460
All right then,mr.Meade,time to sell it.

345
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:36,040
Are you sure he wouldn'trather just wear a
suit? I have a lovely charcoal--ted baker...

346
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:40,120
no suits,and remember,we
love anything the old fart--

347
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,560
ring-a-ding-ding.

348
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,340
Who is that hottie?

349
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:47,670
I didn't think I couldwear
leather,but maybe I can.

350
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:50,950
Of course you can.It's just,um,fun.

351
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:53,790
Can I just do one thing?

352
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,990
Perfect.

353
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:03,380
Good. Now I've gotta run,but
I willsee you tonight.

354
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,430
You look terrific,brad.

355
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:12,390
So,mr.Meade,are we
happy with the outfit?

356
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:13,900
Yes,very.

357
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,820
Maybe it couldbe a little more fun,hmm?

358
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:23,810
Your auntie teresa--a
widow for two weeks,

359
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:26,400
and she's already gota
boyfriend half her age.

360
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,210
Oh.Well,half her real age.

361
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:35,940
What else?Oh,your cousin
marisol-- her chi-chis--fake!

362
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:37,880
Really?

363
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,360
That's so surprising.

364
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,120
Um,aunt mirta,what aboutmy
mother's side of the family?

365
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,990
Well,I only knowrosa's mother yolanda,

366
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:51,180
and forgive me for saying
this,but that woman is a bitch.

367
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,150
Wait. Did you just say "is"?

368
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:56,420
Well,I haven't seen
herin years,but I hear--

369
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,930
so wait,you're sayingthat
my grandma's alive?

370
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,890
Crap.

371
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,240
- grandma's alive?
- Yes.

372
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:09,380
Dad,you lied to us.

373
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:13,710
Why would you keep the one
connection we haveto mom away from us?

374
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:16,140
It was your mother's idea,betty.

375
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,240
Your grandmother hated me.

376
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,220
- Why?
- I was a cook.

377
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:25,850
It was better her daughter staywith a
husband who beat her than to be with me.

378
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:31,210
The night we left,your grandmother
said if rosa walkedout the door with me,

379
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,730
she was dead to her.

380
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:37,480
So they--they just never
spoketo each other again?

381
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,320
Your mother tried.

382
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:42,950
She sent letters,pictures of you girls.

383
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:46,140
They'd alwayscome back unopened.

384
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:52,560
Tio,we're gonna be late
for your appointment.

385
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,090
Go.Go. It's about your visa.

386
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:01,300
We'll talk about this later,okay?

387
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,390
I wanna meet her.

388
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:13,980
I don'T. She sounds like a monster.

389
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,820
Hilda,she's our grandmother.

390
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:18,950
Why do you want to meet someonewho
doesn't want to meet you?

391
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:27,070
You were amazing.You
weren't even scared.

392
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:29,430
The first time I bungeed,I
threw up in my hair.

393
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:32,000
I know,I know. You know,I
wanna do something else.

394
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Let's base jump off of the
topof this building,or skydive.

395
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,620
You are such a freak. I can't believe
how muchlike alex you've become.

396
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:41,890
Oh,I am much better than alex.

397
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:45,440
In fact,I have a confession to make.

398
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,720
The whole timeyou were dating
alex,I hada little crush on you.

399
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,130
You don't think I knew?

400
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:00,990
And the best part?You've
already met my parents.

401
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:09,880
Oh,tavares. uh,this is sebastian.

402
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,890
He's the buyer for barneys.

403
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:13,870
And this is his boyfriend,kenneth.

404
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:16,400
This is keith. Kenneth
and i broke up last spring.

405
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:19,980
I caught him making outwith a waiter
at the ready-to-wear showin paris.

406
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,790
Pret-a-poor
taste.

407
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:27,300
well,this is fun.

408
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:33,470
So far,I'm very impressed.

409
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:36,500
We're showing someof
tavares' best designs later.

410
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,800
They are,like,so good.

411
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,280
And the greasy pawsare on the prada.

412
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,030
Hey,you know what'd be
fun?Um,get me a drink.

413
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,070
- Oh,sure.
- Thank you.

414
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:54,090
you werejust dee-smissed.
Turns outhe's a mean gay.

415
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:56,290
So what?You're a mean gay,too.

416
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:57,840
Yes,but not to you.

417
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,200
Um,yesterday you told memy
head was too big for my neck.

418
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,530
That wasconstructive criticism.

419
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:05,220
- Well,what am I supposed to do about it?
- I don't know.

420
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,530
As a friend,my jobis
only to point things out.

421
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,850
oh,my god.

422
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:12,330
Oh,my god.

423
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:14,260
Oh,my god.

424
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:25,180
wow. Well,just wow.

425
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:28,410
It looks like"brad" is back.

426
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,530
any preference for how we
makeyour old man disappear?

427
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:43,180
I know your mother was
fondof cutting brake lines.

428
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:46,210
I don't want to knowany of the
details. I just want him gone.

429
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:50,510
Good,because once you get offthis
elevator,you never see me again.

430
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:02,370
I won't see youafter the lobby.

431
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:09,060
So how farto this outlet mall?

432
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:12,150
Clara saidit's about 2 miles north.

433
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:16,410
Well,I better finda wedding dress
there,because so farI have nothing.

434
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:20,600
Why is everythingwith this wedding so
hard? Sometimes I'm like,why even bother?

435
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,420
Hilda,come on.Everything's
gonna be okay.

436
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,500
Where did you geta quesadilla?

437
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,040
That guy in back.

438
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,510
Delicioso,ramon. Muy bueno.
(Delicious, Ramon, very good)

439
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:32,420
- I've had better.
- On a bus?

440
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,070
You got a point.

441
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,270
Henry?

442
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:47,020
Henry? Whatdo you mean "henry"?

443
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,040
It's nothing.I-I-I
was just seeing things.

444
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:53,020
Okay,I know that stuff with
momand her mother upset you.

445
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:56,250
I mean,honestly,that's why,when you
said,"let's goshopping," I said okay.

446
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,230
Oh,my god.

447
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,490
We're going tothat
woman's house,aren't we?

448
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:05,440
You know,you were a lot
smarterbefore you got engaged.

449
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:10,270
Amanda,baby,they love my stuff!

450
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:14,020
well,I'd hug you,but my greasy
pawsmight ruin your shirt.

451
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,190
Oh,I'm sorry about that.

452
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:19,160
It's just that it's sucha
big night for me,baby.

453
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:21,690
then lose this jacket.

454
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:24,290
What is thisstill doing here?

455
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:28,380
I like it.It's one of my best.
Coconut shell'sare the next big thing.

456
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:31,660
But wilhelmina hates
them.They make her eyes bleed.

457
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:35,890
Listen,if you wantto get ahead in
this business,you do not cross her.

458
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:38,440
What would I dowithout
you,huh? Come here.

459
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:48,350
really?

460
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,490
I think we're close.

461
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:56,440
Aunt mirta said she livedright outside
villanueva in a little blue house.

462
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,910
- I hope it's still blue.
- Well,I just want to go home.

463
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,580
And to be honest,that
quesadilla isn't sitting so well.

464
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:04,940
Oh,really? Because usually,when you buy
cheese cookedon a bus,it's pretty good.

465
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:07,360
Betty,what are you
hoping to get out of this?

466
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,060
Hilda,I don't know.

467
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,260
But afterwhat the curandera said
and--and us finding outabout grandma,

468
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,450
I just feel likeI'm
supposed to meet her.

469
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:19,180
Well,good luck,because I
don'tthink she wants to meet us.

470
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,010
- It is him.
- What?

471
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,180
Henry!

472
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,750
Betty--ow!

473
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,330
Wait!

474
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:32,690
Wait,henry! Henry,wait!

475
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,550
Betty!

476
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,480
What the hellis going on with you?

477
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,140
It was him,hilda. I saw it.It was henry.

478
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,210
Henry? Out here?

479
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:43,520
- Honey,you are hallucinating.
- Oh,no.

480
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,920
No,no!No,no,no,no,no!

481
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,440
Wait!

482
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:49,870
Wait up!Wait!

483
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:52,040
Ay,betty!

484
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,040
- What are we gonna do now?
- I don't know!

485
00:26:57,050 --> 00:27:01,100
I think that there was a townback
that way,just a few miles.

486
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,690
- Miles?!
- Ow!

487
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:08,480
We may need this.

488
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:12,690
I wantmy bridesmaid's gift back.

489
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:16,970
And I hope you know that I am not
throwingmy bouquet anywhere near you.

490
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:19,230
You know what?I hope
gina gambarro gets it.

491
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:21,520
And if she gets marriedbefore
you,won't you be sad?

492
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:27,180
excuse us,mr.Gossett,jr.

493
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:31,660
I saw you kissing tavares.You're
in love with a gay man.

494
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,630
It's like you and meall over again.

495
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:35,090
I was never in love with you.

496
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:36,710
Oh... are you kidding?

497
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,900
When we first met,you
couldn'tkeep your eyes off of me.

498
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:43,240
Okay,that was beforeyou got your veneers.
You had that dark tooth.I couldn't look away.

499
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,170
- Big head!
- Dark tooth!

500
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:45,970
- Nicole bitchie.
- Nelly ripa.

501
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:49,350
It's sad and pathetic,mandy.He's gay.

502
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:57,070
No,he's not.

503
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:58,580
What?

504
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:01,120
He's just pretending to be to
get ahead in the fashion world.

505
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,450
He's straight,and we
aretotally seeing each other.

506
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:08,070
O.M.G.,He's pretending to be gay?

507
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,450
Well,that's a new twist
on an old standard.

508
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:14,190
Marc,you cannottell anyone.

509
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:21,280
mandy,you're with another guywho's keeping
you a secret. It's like danielall over again.

510
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,810
No,this is not daniel.

511
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:25,010
You are fabulous,amanda.

512
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:28,370
Why do you think you
don'tdeserve a real relationship?

513
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:30,490
Come outof the closet,sweetie.

514
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,840
I promise,it's better.

515
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:36,350
It's okay.I know what I'm doing.

516
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,240
Daniel,what the hellare
you doing with jordan?

517
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,880
Well,so far,just making out,but
by later tonight I hope--

518
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,090
stay away from her.

519
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:49,410
Oh,I love this. you're jealous.

520
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,740
Finally,I get the one
thingyou can't have.

521
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:58,190
You know I guess you probablyshould have thought
of that before you gave awaythe family jewels.

522
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,300
Daniel. Daniel!

523
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:03,550
What is going onwith you?

524
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:05,900
You've neverseen me win before.

525
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,880
Alex,this is me winning.

526
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,850
I can't believeyou made me walk
all this way in these shoes.

527
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:16,560
My feet hurt,betty.

528
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:19,520
- There's gotta be a bus soon.
- Well,let's just forget it.

529
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,390
Let's just live here,get
jobs,watch our asses grow.

530
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,930
I think we're still near villanueva.

531
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,460
Excusar me. Hablas inglés?

532
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:30,140
Yes.

533
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:33,410
Do you know ofa small
blue house around here?

534
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:36,220
A-a woman lives in
it--yolanda salazar.

535
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,240
I'm sorry.

536
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,330
Betty,just give it up.

537
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:44,070
you know,I'm gonna go askthat man
over there selling dirty fruit.

538
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,850
- You want some fruit?
- No.

539
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:47,120
Yes.

540
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,820
You look like you could
usea shot of tequila.

541
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,490
Or two.

542
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,170
Hola.Um...

543
00:29:56,170 --> 00:30:01,110
Do you know if there is
a blue house near here?

544
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,030
excuse me.

545
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,480
- Henry!
- betty,where are you going?

546
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,510
Henry,wait!

547
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,000
Hey,handsome.

548
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,040
I'm giving you a ticket,'cause
you aresmokin' indoors.

549
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,550
Oh,my god. Mr.Meade.

550
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,240
I'm so sorry.I had no idea.

551
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,730
It's fine,marc.Thank you.

552
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:27,050
you owe me.

553
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:29,700
think of it as takinga
bullet for the team.

554
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:33,540
If he doesn't feel good abouthimself,he doesn't
move on. If he doesn't move on,I don't move up.

555
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:42,930
I'm sorry,I didn't mean to stare.

556
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:46,470
I think your earis oozing.

557
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,540
Oh... thank you.

558
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,560
henry!

559
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:22,450
missing branches...

560
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:26,570
the blue house.

561
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:36,080
hello?

562
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,750
Hi,um...

563
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:47,150
yolanda salazar?

564
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:53,750
Hola. Yo soy betty.

565
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,380
Rosa's daughter.

566
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:59,000
Your granddaugter.

567
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:05,200
you have no idea how
muchI've wanted to meet you.

568
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,930
Uh,mucho.

569
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:09,630
Uh,c-can you understand me?

570
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:12,900
Oh,uh... bueno.

571
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,910
She won't talk to you.

572
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:19,440
Her mind is...is no longer... I'm sorry.

573
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,100
He stepped out.

574
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:30,800
I was just going throughthe
proofs from the shoot--

575
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,030
I know what's going
onwith you and daniel.

576
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:37,460
Wow,that was fast. I don't
even knowwhat's going on yet.

577
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,540
You're gonnaget hurt,jordy.

578
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:43,360
Daniel's not in thisfor the right reasons.
He's angry and he's tryingto get back at me.

579
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,940
This is all about me.

580
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:47,940
Of course it's about you.

581
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:51,810
It has always beenabout you.

582
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:54,750
It's probably whyI'm
attracted to daniel.

583
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:58,440
He's the closestI'll ever
get to being with you.

584
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:02,100
What do you want me to do?

585
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:05,110
I want you to dowhat you
should have done two years ago--

586
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:08,890
have the gutsto say good-bye.

587
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,800
Good-bye,jordan.

588
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:36,640
hey,I,uh,thinkI'm gonna go.

589
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,990
What do you want me to do,walk you
to the door? Good night,girlina.

590
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:44,740
I think she's gota thing for you.

591
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:48,040
Yeah,she would sleep atthe
foot of my bed if I let her.

592
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:51,180
Sad little hags always
wantwhat they can't have.

593
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,670
Oh,really?

594
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:56,740
Well,apparently,that sad
little hag can have it and has,

595
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:59,890
in ways that are too
disgustingto even think about.

596
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:04,650
You could've had a realrelationship with
that woman,and you would havebeen lucky,

597
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:08,330
because she is one of the
nicest,easiest girls around.

598
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:11,290
- Marc...okay,maybe she's not nice.
- Shut up!

599
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:13,130
- What's the lesbiantalking about?
- I don't know.

600
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:15,680
Open your eyes,people.He's straight.

601
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:19,600
As straight as the
creaseon an old man's jeans.

602
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:25,270
well,this ismy very
first public "inning,"

603
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:28,250
and while it's interesting,I
don't see how it's relevant.

604
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:31,860
it isn'T. The one thing we are in
the fashion industryis tolerant.

605
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,570
If you look like that,you're in.

606
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:37,470
The only important thingis the design.

607
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:41,580
Well,then,should we startwith
some of his favorites?

608
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:01,340
I'm sorry to barge inlike this.
I didn't meanto disturb you.

609
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,610
Is it okayif I just...  s?

610
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:13,330
I just...I wanna say good-bye.

611
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:17,190
Rosa.

612
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:20,050
My daughter!You've come back.

613
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:21,800
no,no.

614
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,880
No,no,no,I'm not rosa.

615
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:27,050
Rosa...  perdóname...  ay,dios míO.

616
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:29,790
Forgive me for what I said last night.

617
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:33,160
You have always been in my heart.

618
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:37,930
You are my daughter and I love you.

619
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,660
Oh,thank God,for this second chance.

620
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:45,050
You left behind so many of your clothes.

621
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:46,680
What--what
is she doing?

622
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:49,600
She saysyou left some things behind.

623
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:53,480
Rosa,I was wrong.

624
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:56,060
Go with Ignacio.

625
00:35:56,260 --> 00:36:00,430
If you love someone you must
find a way to be with him.

626
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:04,260
Even if you have to leave your family

627
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:12,900
mirta told meyou were here.

628
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:17,070
Did you understandwhat she said?

629
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:25,270
You are brave,my Rosa.

630
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:28,480
fight for the man you love.

631
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:31,870
I will.

632
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,990
you should have stayed a littlewhile longer at
the party.It did geta little more interesting.

633
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:45,020
I'm sorry,willie.I couldn't do it.

634
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:48,180
I was a fool to think I
could ever bebrad meade again.

635
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:51,000
You know,I remember brad.

636
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:55,020
He ran this placewhen I started.

637
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,840
Plenty of women in
the buildingwanted him.

638
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,670
However,there was one
womanwho wasn't interested.

639
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:03,230
Me.

640
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:06,550
I thought bradwas a fool,

641
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:11,410
but bradgrew
into bradford--

642
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:17,200
a strong,wise,sexy
man--

643
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,060
a man who's ruinedall other men for me.

644
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,890
Here's to starting over.

645
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,870
Mm,that feels good.

646
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:50,790
But you aregonna wash your
hands,right? I mean,you do touch food.

647
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:54,790
This is the specialtyof the house.

648
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,060
You seem so stressed.

649
00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:00,750
Well,I don't knowwhy I wouldn't be.
I'm getting marriedin,like,a minute,

650
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:03,130
and everythingis so freaking hard.

651
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:05,890
I-I got no hall booked,I
can't find a wedding dress--

652
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:09,100
it seems like all the signs
aretelling you to not get married.

653
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,960
Well,I'm not really a
girlwho believes in signs.

654
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:15,700
Too bad,because there is a reason
why you cannot findthat dress.

655
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:18,920
There is a reason why
youwere brought here... to me.

656
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:23,220
I know what you're doing,antonio.

657
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,510
what?Who can blame me,eh?

658
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:29,130
But am I right?

659
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:33,150
Tell me,hilda,why is everything so hard?

660
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:35,310
Hilda!

661
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:37,650
- I found the house!
- You did?

662
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:40,430
Grandma gave me this.It was mom'S.

663
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:42,430
Oh,my god!

664
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:46,340
It's beautiful.It's the dress!

665
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:50,240
You see,antonio?I found my sign!

666
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:52,890
I'm getting married! Okay.

667
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:56,910
Oh,my god,tell me everything,but tell me in the
car. And grab my bag,cause I gotta get shoes.

668
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:00,070
gracias  for taking care of my daughter.

669
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:02,290
- Antonio barreiro.
- Ignacio suarez.

670
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,530
It is very good to
meet you,ignacio suarez.

671
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:08,380
Placer es mi?
(pleasure is mine)

672
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:18,760
You will never believe
who is back in Mexico.

673
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:22,640
Looks like you will
finally have your revenge.

674
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:33,530
hey,uh,I left my walletin
the bedroom. Just a second.

675
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:41,890
Hey,what
the--

676
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:46,790
- Okay,
- shut up.

677
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,620
- oh,sorry.
- Shh.We'll get caught.

678
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:54,390
Please,if anybody hears us,they'll just think it's christinastumbling
around blind drunk,crying and making out with a mannequin.

679
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:56,160
- Again.
- Okay,listen to me.

680
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,620
You havebeen through it tonight,woman,

681
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:01,780
and you deserve a treat.

682
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:04,000
- Mm,I do.
- And so do I.

683
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,780
The only action I got
tonightwas with old man meade.

684
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:09,830
And I'd say that's
worthsomething in a rare silk.

685
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:12,460
shoes. I wantthose peep-toe shoes.

686
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,900
peep-toe.

687
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:20,860
what?

688
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,410
oh,my god.

689
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:27,220
Fey sommers' secret room.

690
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:29,920
- The love dungeon?
- It's real.

691
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,120
I'm gonna fightfor henry.

692
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:50,790
If I don't,I'll regret
itfor the rest of my life.

693
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,740
I'm glad,mija.

694
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:56,380
I can't waitto get home.

695
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,170
Betty,I...

696
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:02,860
- I won't be going home with you.
- What?

697
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,710
Things didn't go so
wellat the consulate.

698
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:08,970
They denied my visa.

699
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:10,400
So what--what
does that mean?

700
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,420
It means I have to stay
here,for I don't know how long.

701
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:18,210
Okay,fine.Well,then,we'll all stay,

702
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:20,160
and we'll wait,and we'll figure it out.

703
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,060
Dad,I'm not going homewithout you.

704
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:24,610
No,no,you are going home,betty.

705
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:26,580
This is your future.

706
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:29,570
I leftmy family once,too.

707
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,130
Don't be afraid.

708
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:36,030
You're strong,mija,

709
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:40,650
just like your mother.
