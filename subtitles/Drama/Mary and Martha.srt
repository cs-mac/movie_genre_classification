I'm heading home,

Peter, this is Martha.

Oh, hello, Peter.
Very pleased to meet you.

No, I'll get it.
Oh, thanks, thanks.

To try to shift the needle

Iraq, Afghanistan--

1408

up too much of your time.

1458
01:22:19,902 --> 01:22:23,137
Um, so before I start,
I'll just say that

1459
01:22:23,139 --> 01:22:25,139
there's only a couple
of things I want to say,

1460
01:22:25,141 --> 01:22:28,375
and the first is
congratulations.

1461
01:22:28,377 --> 01:22:29,843
Thank you.

1462
01:22:29,845 --> 01:22:31,345
We do believe when
it comes to malaria

1463
01:22:31,347 --> 01:22:33,647
America leads
the world.

1464
01:22:33,649 --> 01:22:35,616
But as a country,
we still spend more

1465
01:22:35,618 --> 01:22:39,253
on the cure for baldness
than the cure for malaria.

1466
01:22:39,255 --> 01:22:41,555
[Laughter]

1467
01:22:41,557 --> 01:22:43,691
So my second point
and the purpose

1468
01:22:43,693 --> 01:22:49,596
of my submission is to
ask for more, please.

1469
01:22:49,598 --> 01:22:51,899
Right now.

1470
01:22:51,901 --> 01:22:53,667
Of course, Mrs. Morgan,
and if we lived

1471
01:22:53,669 --> 01:22:55,336
in an ideal world,
there'd be all the money

1472
01:22:55,338 --> 01:22:57,071
in the world
for malaria,

1473
01:22:57,073 --> 01:22:58,906
but a friend of mine
used to say,

1474
01:22:58,908 --> 01:23:00,341
"Politics is a pie.

1475
01:23:00,343 --> 01:23:02,810
It's just a question
of how you slice it."

1476
01:23:02,812 --> 01:23:05,512
What we do here in this
committee is look soberly

1477
01:23:05,514 --> 01:23:08,482
and seriously
with experts in the field

1478
01:23:08,484 --> 01:23:12,152
at how and if we can
increase that slice

1479
01:23:12,154 --> 01:23:14,922
or if, in the very hard
times for everyone,

1480
01:23:14,924 --> 01:23:17,324
it has to be a slightly
smaller portion.

1481
01:23:17,326 --> 01:23:21,595
Pardon me, but are you
saying that I'm not
an expert in the field?

1482
01:23:24,065 --> 01:23:29,203
Mrs. Morgan, we're all
aware of your personal
involvement in this area

1483
01:23:29,205 --> 01:23:32,139
and all admire your courage
in coming here today.

1484
01:23:32,141 --> 01:23:34,408
Well, since I'm not
an expert in the field,

1485
01:23:34,410 --> 01:23:36,477
perhaps you would
prefer that I focus

1486
01:23:36,479 --> 01:23:39,580
on my personal involvement.

1487
01:23:39,582 --> 01:23:40,814
Let me tell you
how it feels

1488
01:23:40,816 --> 01:23:45,753
to have a personal involvement
with malaria.

1489
01:23:45,755 --> 01:23:49,790
I miss my son every second
of every day.

1490
01:23:49,792 --> 01:23:56,430
I miss him
with every bite of food

1491
01:23:56,432 --> 01:23:58,298
and every
familiar object I hold.

1492
01:23:58,300 --> 01:23:59,967
and I think of that
movie, you know,

1493
01:23:59,969 --> 01:24:02,836
"Back to the Future,"
where that bastard McFly

1494
01:24:02,838 --> 01:24:07,474
can just go back in time
because that's my greatest wish,

1495
01:24:07,476 --> 01:24:09,643
that I could
just go back just once

1496
01:24:09,645 --> 01:24:11,945
and change that one thing.

1497
01:24:11,947 --> 01:24:15,616
I would give anything to
change that one thing,

1498
01:24:15,618 --> 01:24:19,186
and my point,
Madam Chair,

1499
01:24:19,188 --> 01:24:22,756
my point is that how
I feel is how the parent

1500
01:24:22,758 --> 01:24:26,760
of every single child lost
to malaria feels.

of one child,
