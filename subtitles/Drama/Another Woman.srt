2
00:00:24,537 --> 00:00:29,958

<i>fulfilment, personally and professionally.</i>

3
00:00:30,335 --> 00:00:33,289
<i>Beyond that, I would say</i>
<i>"I don't choose to delve. "

4
00:00:33,421 --> 00:00:37,370
<i>Not that I was afraid of uncovering</i>

<i>My husband is a very accomplished</i>
<i>physician, a cardiologist,</i>

10
00:00:58,031 --> 00:01:02,859
<i>who some years ago examined my heart,</i>
<i>liked what he saw and proposed.</i>

11
00:01:02,994 --> 00:01:07,406
<i>It's the second marriage for us both, and</i>
<i>he brought to it a 16-year-old daughter</i>

12
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:10,874
<i>who lives with his former wife</i>
<i>but visits us frequently.</i>

13
00:01:11,003 --> 00:01:14,372
<i>She's a sweet girl who can be</i>
<i>a little undisciplined at times,</i>

14
00:01:14,506 --> 00:01:17,957
<i>and I've tried to take her</i>
<i>under my wing as best I can.</i>

15
00:01:18,594 --> 00:01:21,001
<i>I also have a married brother.</i>

<i>normally I write at home</i>

18

<i>has become so terrible,</i>

19
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:37,358
<i>I subleased a one-room flat</i>
<i>downtown as an office.</i>

20
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:41,565
<i>A new book is always</i>
<i>a very demanding project</i>

21
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:44,572
<i>and it requires that I really shut myself off</i>

<i>(man)</i> Something about him
just got to a deeper thing in me.

26
00:03:08,293 --> 00:03:13,370
So this was my... my big experience
with another man. My first one.

27
00:03:14,925 --> 00:03:19,883
And I've never been able to get it out of
my mind. I still have fantasies about it,

28
00:03:20,598 --> 00:03:23,053
which are sort of bugging me.

<i>(psychiatrist)</i> What do
you mean, "fantasies"?

30
00:03:28,314 --> 00:03:32,726
<i>(man)</i> Well, sometimes when I'm
masturbating, or when I'm just...

31
00:03:34,487 --> 00:03:37,856
Well, sometimes when I'm...
when I'm working,

32
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:43,110
I find myself thinking about Giles.

33
00:03:43,747 --> 00:03:47,447
And, uh, it's not that I'm not
attracted to my wife any more.

34
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:53,207
I mean, I still am. I really am physically
moved by her, and other women, but...

<i>While eavesdropping on the intimate</i>

<i>I worked hard all day,</i>

<i>that I was totally arrested by its sadness.</i>

49
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,777
<i>(woman)</i> I just know that I woke up
during the middle of the night.

50

And time passed, and
there were strange shadows.

51
00:05:09,921 --> 00:05:13,206
I began having troubling
thoughts about my life.

52
00:05:14,926 --> 00:05:18,211
Like there was
something about it not real.

53
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:22,678
Full of deceptions.

54
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:25,348
That these... these deceptions

55
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:28,729
had become so... so many,

56
00:05:28,858 --> 00:05:31,728
and so much a part of me now,

57
00:05:31,861 --> 00:05:35,360
that I couldn't even tell who I really was.

58
00:05:37,116 --> 00:05:39,986
And suddenly I began to perspire.

59
00:05:41,204 --> 00:05:45,284
I sat up in bed with
my heart just pounding.

60
00:05:46,126 --> 00:05:49,210
And I looked at my husband next to me,

61
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,628
and it was as if he... he was a stranger.

62
00:05:55,219 --> 00:05:58,338
And I turned on the light
and I woke him up,

63
00:05:58,472 --> 00:06:01,426
and I asked him to hold me.

64
00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:03,385
<i>(sobs)</i>

65
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:08,314
And only after a long time
did I finally get my bearings.

66
00:06:09,901 --> 00:06:12,439
But for one moment, earlier,

67
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:16,069
it was as if a curtain had parted,

68
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:19,153
and I could see myself clearly.

69
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,990
But I was afraid of what I saw.

70
00:06:23,457 --> 00:06:25,117
<i>(sniffs)</i>

71
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:28,335
And what I had to look forward to.

72
00:06:29,338 --> 00:06:31,876
And I wondered...

73
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,085
I wondered about ending everything.

74
00:07:18,682 --> 00:07:20,342
Please, please.

75
00:07:20,475 --> 00:07:25,979
It is with a mixture of some joy,
but mostly paralysing anxiety,

76
00:07:27,858 --> 00:07:31,274
that I hereby plunge into the big five-o.

77
00:07:36,242 --> 00:07:39,243
I was, uh, I was fine till last week.

78
00:07:39,913 --> 00:07:44,658
Then my son said to me, "Gee, Dad,
don't your options begin running out?"

79
00:07:46,419 --> 00:07:48,791
He's very funny, my son.

80
00:07:53,302 --> 00:07:56,587
Marion, I was telling Lydia
about your little adventure today.

81
00:07:56,722 --> 00:07:59,723
- Oh, yes.
- Those new buildings are built so thin.

82
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:03,266
- No, this is an old brownstone.
- Well, there's no privacy left.

83
00:08:03,396 --> 00:08:07,228
Last week Lydia and I were at home.
It was a Sunday morning...

84
00:08:07,358 --> 00:08:10,524
- Mark...
- This is true. And we started kissing...

85
00:08:10,653 --> 00:08:14,152
- Mark!
- And next thing we were on the floor...

86
00:08:14,282 --> 00:08:17,485
- Are you crazy? He's drunk.
- I was having her on the kitchen floor.

87
00:08:17,619 --> 00:08:20,620
The living room floor,
the living room floor.

88
00:08:20,747 --> 00:08:24,365
- I gotta admit, it was a surprise.
- Did it not happen that way?

89
00:08:24,501 --> 00:08:29,459
So the door opens, and the
superintendent... he has the key...

90
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:33,208
- Oh, no.
- barges in. Some kind of plumbing leak.

91
00:08:33,344 --> 00:08:35,632
And we are <i>in flagrante delicto.</i>

92
00:08:35,763 --> 00:08:39,428
You know what he does? He gets up,
stark naked, and says "Mr Banducci,

93
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:42,809
this is not the pipe that needs fixing."

94
00:08:42,937 --> 00:08:46,851
That was quick, Ken. Could you have
come up with anything that quick?

95
00:08:46,983 --> 00:08:49,770
- No.
- That was grace under pressure.

96
00:08:49,903 --> 00:08:51,942
- Did he laugh?
- Oh, no.

97
00:08:52,072 --> 00:08:55,156
He turned very red
and he crossed himself.

98
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:58,945
Sad.

99
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:07,002
One good thing about becoming 50.
You don't have to do it again.

100
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:15,339
I know.

101
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:19,801
It's Laura. She had another fight with
her mother, wants to sleep at our place.

102
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:22,390
It's not fair to Kathy.

103
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:27,476
Well, you tell her, cos once again
I can't get through to my daughter.

104
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:30,313
I know. Just... hold on a minute.

105
00:09:30,446 --> 00:09:33,115
Will you talk to Marion? OK.

106
00:09:35,117 --> 00:09:37,904
Laura? This is not a good habit to get into.

107
00:09:38,037 --> 00:09:42,117
You know your mother's high-strung.
She's just gonna get frantic.

108
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:47,754
Well, it may not seem fair to you, but
it's up to you to deal with her moods.

109
00:09:49,549 --> 00:09:53,677
Well, if she can't, then you
just have to rise above it.

110
00:09:53,804 --> 00:09:57,386
OK? I'll see you at my father's tomorrow.

111
00:09:57,516 --> 00:10:00,303
We'll talk about it then. OK.

112
00:10:00,436 --> 00:10:01,811
Bye-bye.

113
00:10:01,937 --> 00:10:05,637
She listens to you cos she looks up
to you. Me, there's no communication.

114
00:10:05,775 --> 00:10:08,859
It's just... It's a terrible situation.

I don't know.

Hey, Ken, what are you doing

Hello, Lydia. Look,
you know my wife pretty good.

127

- Oh, my God. You know, you guys...

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,051
- I'm only teasing.
- That was really embarrassing before.

00:11:21,188 --> 00:11:24,272
But not unpleasant

Why, I hardly know you.

148
00:12:33,389 --> 00:12:36,093
Well... he wouldn't.

149
00:12:36,225 --> 00:12:39,012
Well, why not? He has before.

Marion,

don't you know how he feels about you?

152
00:12:43,983 --> 00:12:46,937
Sure. We've always been very close.

153
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:51,484
You're deluding yourself.

154
00:12:51,616 --> 00:12:54,700
Of course, in a way he idolises you, but...

155
00:12:55,746 --> 00:12:58,201
he also hates you.

156
00:13:01,126 --> 00:13:04,043
I'm sorry, I don't accept that.

157
00:13:04,713 --> 00:13:09,173
You're such a perceptive woman. How
can you not understand his feelings?

00:13:09,302 --> 00:13:11,757
Look, um, I'm late, and...

160
00:13:14,265 --> 00:13:19,721
to tell you the truth, I make it a practice
of never getting into these conversations.

161
00:13:19,854 --> 00:13:23,851
They're fruitless, and people say
things that they're sorry for later.

Why don't you just tell me how much you
need and I'll discuss it with Ken. OK?

You think at your age you can meet
someone and fall in love again?

One hopes at my age

- No, just, you know, now and then.

Someday he'll defraud somebody in

00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:50,683
<i>You were so good to us. I can still</i>
<i>taste the cookies you used to bake.</i>

297
00:23:50,811 --> 00:23:55,389
<i>You used to sit up with us when we had</i>
<i>those miserable colds. You were a saint.</i>

298
00:23:55,650 --> 00:24:00,691
<i>Oh, and here I am, older. I could go up</i>
<i>to the spare room and paint for hours.</i>

299
00:24:00,822 --> 00:24:03,739
<i>The time would just fly by</i>
<i>when I was doing a picture.</i>

300
00:24:04,033 --> 00:24:08,077
<i>And there I am with my friend Claire.</i>
<i>You know, she became an actress.</i>

301
00:24:08,205 --> 00:24:11,905
<i>We used to be so close,</i>
<i>but I haven't seen her in years.</i>

302
00:24:13,001 --> 00:24:17,544
<i>And there's my mother. She loved</i>
<i>strolling around the grounds.</i>

303
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:22,546
<i>She loved all beautiful things.</i>
<i>She loved nature, music, poetry.</i>

304
00:24:23,137 --> 00:24:26,007
<i>That was her whole existence.</i>

305
00:24:30,061 --> 00:24:34,308
- Paul? I'd like to discuss something.
- Yes, Dad?

306
00:24:34,441 --> 00:24:37,726
I've had a talk with my brother Ben.

307
00:24:37,861 --> 00:24:42,321
And he has promised me that he will find
a position for you next season in his firm.

308
00:24:42,449 --> 00:24:44,987
I don't wanna work
in a cardboard box factory.

309
00:24:45,118 --> 00:24:50,622
- It's paper products, Paul, not just boxes.
- But I tried it once. I go nuts.

310
00:24:50,749 --> 00:24:52,575
Paul...

311
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:56,495
There are some obligations
one must accept.

312
00:24:57,215 --> 00:24:59,753
This has not been a good year.

313
00:25:00,259 --> 00:25:04,043
Your mother is very ill, and I
have decided to take time off

314
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,849
to finish my study on
the Continental Congress.

315
00:25:06,975 --> 00:25:12,100
It's important that there is enough money
to see that Marion can go away to college.

316
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:15,930
I want her to take that scholarship.
She is such a brilliant girl.

317
00:25:16,068 --> 00:25:17,894
But I had other plans.

318
00:25:18,028 --> 00:25:22,072
I'm sure those plans included
card-playing and time-wasting.

319
00:25:22,199 --> 00:25:26,362
- That's not fair.
- Paul, your grades are mediocre.

320
00:25:26,495 --> 00:25:31,572
It's not because you're not smart enough,
it's simply that you don't apply yourself.

321
00:25:31,709 --> 00:25:34,247
I know. And Marion's a genius.

322
00:25:35,213 --> 00:25:38,416
She has the opportunity
to go to Bryn Mawr.

323
00:25:39,342 --> 00:25:42,212
- Do you want to prevent her?
- No.

324
00:25:42,929 --> 00:25:47,840
She's going to be something. She's got
what it takes. There are no limits for her.

325
00:25:49,103 --> 00:25:54,310
If only I could stop her daydreaming in
the woods with her beloved watercolours.

326
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:07,412
<i>(Marion)</i> Paul?

327
00:26:10,041 --> 00:26:11,369
What's wrong?

328
00:26:11,501 --> 00:26:15,119
He's making me go to work
in the paper box factory.

329
00:26:16,006 --> 00:26:18,841
- Well, what do you wanna do?
- I don't know.

330
00:26:18,967 --> 00:26:23,545
Move out of the house, travel,
find some interesting business,

331
00:26:23,681 --> 00:26:26,635
anything but work in a paper box factory.

332
00:26:27,435 --> 00:26:30,305
I hate him. Both of them.

333
00:26:31,022 --> 00:26:33,477
They live in their own world.

334
00:26:33,608 --> 00:26:35,018
<i>(# "Sonata for Cello and Piano No. 2")</i>

335
00:26:57,091 --> 00:27:00,460
- Is this close enough?
- Yeah, I'm meeting Scott right up here.

336
00:27:00,595 --> 00:27:05,340
Why don't you come? He'd love to meet
you, and I've told him a lot about you.

337
00:27:05,475 --> 00:27:08,678
Thank you, honey, but I'm really tired.

338
00:27:08,812 --> 00:27:11,516
- Can I take a rain check?
- Come on, just for one beer.

339
00:27:11,648 --> 00:27:14,933
It's really early, and Dad's
not gonna be home yet.

340
00:27:15,777 --> 00:27:17,935
Do you see someone?

341
00:27:18,071 --> 00:27:20,526
- I do.
- Who?

342
00:27:21,158 --> 00:27:26,116
It's just, uh... it's an acquaintance
of mine, it's a woman I know.

343
00:27:28,541 --> 00:27:32,040
All right, well, thanks a lot.
I had a terrific time.

344
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:34,743
- OK.
- OK. Bye.

345
00:28:54,506 --> 00:28:57,590
I forgot half of that speech tonight.

346
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,259
Marion. I...

347
00:29:01,389 --> 00:29:04,390
- Claire?
- It's you. It is you. It is.

348
00:29:04,517 --> 00:29:08,349
- Claire? I was just talking about you.
- Yes?

349
00:29:08,479 --> 00:29:13,935
I was going through old photos at my
father's house. What are you doing here?

350
00:29:14,069 --> 00:29:18,446
- I'm doing a play. And it's closing, but...
- You're in a show?

351
00:29:18,573 --> 00:29:21,739
Yes. I guess you don't read
the theatre section of the paper.

352
00:29:21,869 --> 00:29:24,905
Well, yes, I do, but I just had no idea.

353
00:29:26,832 --> 00:29:30,995
I'm sorry, what am I doing? I'm sorry.
This is my husband, this is Jack.

354
00:29:31,128 --> 00:29:33,286
- Marion Post.
- Nice to meet you.

355
00:29:33,422 --> 00:29:37,371
Oh, my goodness. Claire, I have
wondered about you so often.

356
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:42,006
- Well, we live in Monterey now.
- Really? Do you have time for a drink?

357
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:46,636
- Sorry, we're meeting some friends.
- No, we have time till our appointment.

358
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:49,771
- Do we?
- Oh, great. There must be a place here.

359
00:29:49,898 --> 00:29:53,432
- Come on, this way. Straight ahead.
- I just...

360
00:30:00,076 --> 00:30:04,619
<i>(Marion)</i> ..Amnesty International and
ACLU. Then they were on the same day.

361
00:30:04,747 --> 00:30:09,290
<i>(Jack)</i> Listen, you gotta be kidding me.
Are you saying that you are

362
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:13,666
a member of Amnesty International
<i>and</i> the American Civil Liberties Union?

363
00:30:13,798 --> 00:30:16,752
Marion always had the urge
to save humanity, didn't you?

364
00:30:16,885 --> 00:30:19,839
Just give me a flood or a famine. Ken too.

365
00:30:19,971 --> 00:30:23,505
- Where do you find the time?
- It doesn't work out all the time.

366
00:30:23,642 --> 00:30:26,892
And head of the philosophy
department. It's impossible.

367
00:30:27,021 --> 00:30:30,354
I took two years of philosophy,
University of Chicago.

368
00:30:30,483 --> 00:30:35,228
- They've got a great department.
- It was good, before they made me leave.

369
00:30:35,363 --> 00:30:38,779
And Claire, you never told me
about this chapter in your life.

370
00:30:38,908 --> 00:30:41,529
- I thought I had.
- We were so close.

371
00:30:41,661 --> 00:30:44,864
- It was clear she'd be a gifted actress.
- No...

372
00:30:44,998 --> 00:30:49,126
Don't you believe her.
This woman always had that flair.

373
00:30:49,252 --> 00:30:53,166
Do you get to the theatre much?
I guess not with your schedule.

374
00:30:53,298 --> 00:30:57,545
I do. My husband really prefers
the opera, but there's so little to see.

375
00:30:57,678 --> 00:31:01,545
- I used to be a devoted Brechtian.
- I staged some Brecht.

376
00:31:01,682 --> 00:31:03,888
- Did you?
- Yes. <i>Mother Courage.</i>

377
00:31:04,018 --> 00:31:07,221
- Not the one here?
- Yes, the one here. Did you see it?

378
00:31:07,355 --> 00:31:12,432
Sure I saw it. That's the most intelligent
rendering of that play I've ever seen.

379
00:31:12,569 --> 00:31:15,523
- That's sweet of you.
- I had problems with the translation.

380
00:31:15,655 --> 00:31:18,525
Some of the speeches
could have been a little better.

381
00:31:18,658 --> 00:31:23,569
- Exactly. The translation was awkward.
- But you did a terrific job. Really terrific.

382
00:31:23,705 --> 00:31:26,622
Hey, hey. Hey.

383
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:29,953
Look at me once in a while.
I'm your wife, not her.

384
00:31:30,087 --> 00:31:31,000
Huh?

385
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:34,333
You've been hanging on her
every word since we sat down.

386
00:31:34,467 --> 00:31:36,175
You're embarrassing me.

387
00:31:36,302 --> 00:31:40,251
Jack is very impressed by certain things
which I apparently cannot give him.

388
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:41,848
Claire, take it easy.

389
00:31:41,975 --> 00:31:46,387
Do you deny he's been looking
into your eyes for over an hour?

390
00:31:46,521 --> 00:31:50,601
- I don't think you heard one word I said.
- You're a little drunk.

391
00:31:50,734 --> 00:31:54,778
- If you'd rather be alone with her...
- Claire, stop it, this is foolish.

392
00:31:54,905 --> 00:31:58,819
- We're just having a nice chat.
- Don't. Don't play innocent with me.

393
00:31:58,951 --> 00:32:01,358
- This wouldn't be the first time.
- Stop this.

394
00:32:01,495 --> 00:32:04,199
- What does that mean?
- Let's go, Claire. Sorry, Marion.

395
00:32:04,332 --> 00:32:06,205
We've been in this situation before,

396
00:32:06,334 --> 00:32:10,794
where you so innocently wound up
causing me to doubt my whole life.

397
00:32:10,922 --> 00:32:13,923
Claire, you're being awfully theatrical.

398
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:16,291
I don't know what you're talking about.

399
00:32:16,428 --> 00:32:20,295
We didn't just drift apart,
Marion. I withdrew.

400
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:25,682
- You're not talking about David?
- Then you do know.

401
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,774
- I know I never had any interest in him.
- But you knew how much I cared for him.

402
00:32:30,901 --> 00:32:36,357
I had nothing to do with him. And I never
gave him a shred of encouragement.

403
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:37,984
That's not true.

404
00:32:38,117 --> 00:32:43,870
Your conversations were full of subtle
flirtations, full of meaningful little looks,

405
00:32:43,998 --> 00:32:49,585
and... little gambits designed to seduce.

406
00:32:50,505 --> 00:32:52,877
That's so untrue.

407
00:32:53,008 --> 00:32:55,047
And you've held that against me?

408
00:32:55,177 --> 00:32:59,126
He couldn't see anything except
how infatuated he was with you.

409
00:32:59,264 --> 00:33:03,213
We never spent a single moment alone.
I never had anything to do with him.

410
00:33:03,352 --> 00:33:09,022
And I say you seduced him. You just...
you turned it on whenever he was around.

411
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:11,819
Maybe you didn't even know
that you were doing it.

412
00:33:11,944 --> 00:33:14,861
Claire, let's get off the subject.

413
00:33:15,281 --> 00:33:17,772
I must have seemed
very bland to him after you.

414
00:33:17,909 --> 00:33:23,413
This is nonsense! To have backed off of
a close friendship because of a fantasy?

415
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:26,457
I'm sure I brought it on myself.
I was so proud of you.

416
00:33:26,585 --> 00:33:32,374
You were my best friend. You were so
witty and so quick, and I was so naive.

417
00:33:32,508 --> 00:33:36,208
Of course you would want David
to fall for you. He was exceptional.

418
00:33:36,345 --> 00:33:41,386
I refused his overtures. I told him he was
with you and it was out of the question.

419
00:33:41,517 --> 00:33:45,099
- By that time you had what you wanted.
- That's absurd.

420
00:33:45,855 --> 00:33:49,520
I really believe that you may not
have realised what you were doing.

421
00:33:49,651 --> 00:33:53,269
This is outrageous.
You should never drink.

422
00:33:53,405 --> 00:33:58,992
I swear to you, it was never in my mind.
Not consciously or subconsciously or...

423
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:03,994
Think about it. Just think about it
sometime. You should be the actress.

424
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:19,380
<i>When I got home Ken was asleep.</i>
<i>I was too shaken up to go to bed.</i>

425
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:23,558
<i>The incident with Claire had</i>
<i>left me edgy and uncomfortable.</i>

426
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:27,138
<i>I thought if I read for a while</i>
<i>it might relax me.</i>

427
00:34:27,274 --> 00:34:30,228
<i>I thumbed through</i>
<i>my mother's edition of Rilke.</i>

428
00:34:31,278 --> 00:34:35,821
<i>When I was 16 I had done a paper</i>
<i>on his poem about the panther,</i>

429
00:34:36,367 --> 00:34:41,076
<i>and on the image that the panther saw</i>
<i>as it stared out from its cage.</i>

430
00:34:41,205 --> 00:34:44,739
<i>And that image, I concluded,</i>
<i>could only be death.</i>

431
00:34:46,794 --> 00:34:49,664
<i>Then I saw my mother's favourite poem,</i>

432
00:34:50,507 --> 00:34:53,176
<i>"Archaic Torso of Apollo".</i>

433
00:34:55,095 --> 00:34:59,507
<i>There were stains on the page,</i>
<i>which I believe were her tears.</i>

434
00:35:01,602 --> 00:35:04,472
<i>They fell across the last line.</i>

435

<i>"For here there is no place</i>
<i>that does not see you. "

436
00:35:12,113 --> 00:35:15,030

438
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:23,581
<i>(Marion)</i> I ran into an old friend.

439
00:35:23,708 --> 00:35:27,919
Then I didn't sleep. I don't think
I closed my eyes for ten minutes.

00:35:28,046 --> 00:35:31,000
I don't know how you do it. I'd collapse.

We're going to the concert
with Mark and Lydia tonight.

442
00:35:34,219 --> 00:35:37,552
I'm good for today, it's tomorrow I'll feel it.

443
00:35:38,724 --> 00:35:42,306
Yeah, but tomorrow we're going
to Tom and Eleanor's for dinner.

444
00:35:42,436 --> 00:35:47,062
And Friday, Mark and Lydia are
taking us out for our anniversary.

445
00:35:47,191 --> 00:35:51,319
- Is it our anniversary already?
- Yeah. Goes quickly, doesn't it?

446
00:35:54,741 --> 00:35:56,780
What's the matter?

447

I don't know.

00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:02,369
What is it?

449
00:36:03,208 --> 00:36:06,493
Well, you know, shouldn't we
spend our anniversary alone?

450
00:36:06,629 --> 00:36:10,840
We could go to the restaurant where
we had our first night together.

451
00:36:10,967 --> 00:36:13,208

Did I seduce you away from your wife?

457
00:36:46,713 --> 00:36:49,583
No, I seduced you, don't you remember?

458
00:36:50,633 --> 00:36:55,378
Then I was worried in case you wouldn't
consider me because I was married.

459
00:36:57,516 --> 00:36:59,093
Well...

460

You know that kid idolises you.

Yeah.

462

I realised... that I disappointed you.

513
00:42:22,358 --> 00:42:27,233
And worse, I realised that I embarrass
you. How I live and who I marry, and...

514
00:42:28,948 --> 00:42:33,610
Of course, that's falling apart now,
so we don't have to worry about it.

have supported her and the kids properly.

517
00:42:47,968 --> 00:42:51,467
Well, would that be so awful?
Working for Andrew?

518

You used to say that.

00:43:07,114 --> 00:43:12,072
when I, uh, I showed you something I'd
written? You remember what you said?

523
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:16,998
No, I don't remember. I was
probably just trying to be truthful.

524
00:43:17,917 --> 00:43:22,828
Yes, I'm sure.
You said "This is overblown."

"It's so embarrassing."

528
00:43:35,101 --> 00:43:36,892
I said that?

529

Exactly your words.

586
00:48:19,485 --> 00:48:22,154
drawing to a close,

587
00:48:22,279 --> 00:48:24,817
I have only regrets.

588
00:48:25,825 --> 00:48:29,774
Regrets that the woman
I shared my life with

589
00:48:30,538 --> 00:48:33,622
is not the one I loved the most deeply.

590
00:48:34,751 --> 00:48:40,338
Regrets that there is no love between
my son and myself. That is my fault.

591
00:48:41,758 --> 00:48:46,467
Regrets that perhaps I've been
too severe with my daughter,

592
00:48:47,306 --> 00:48:52,810
too demanding, that I haven't
given her enough feeling.

593
00:48:54,647 --> 00:48:57,351
But I was so unhappy myself,

594
00:48:57,483 --> 00:49:03,070
so caught up in those stupid
studies of historical figures.

595
00:49:04,991 --> 00:49:09,569
Even though I have achieved
some eminence in my field,

596
00:49:10,622 --> 00:49:13,409
I asked too little of myself.

597
00:49:15,585 --> 00:49:21,208
<i>Suddenly the dream shifted and I found</i>
<i>myself on a street that was familiar.</i>

598
00:49:21,342 --> 00:49:26,087
<i>It seemed to be where I had run</i>
<i>into Claire, in front of the theatre.</i>

599
00:49:26,847 --> 00:49:29,931
<i>(# "Ecuatorial")</i>

600
00:49:39,569 --> 00:49:42,320
- What's going on?
- Come on in. It's OK.

601
00:49:44,032 --> 00:49:48,528
Would she like to observe the rehearsal?
Claire is such a good actress.

602
00:49:48,871 --> 00:49:51,658
She plays innumerable roles.

603
00:49:51,790 --> 00:49:55,123
Would you ever think of making love
to me on the living room floor?

604
00:49:55,252 --> 00:49:59,380
- Would you want me to?
- I don't know. Would you want to?

605
00:49:59,924 --> 00:50:03,127
Well, somehow I've never seen you
as the hardwood floor type.

606
00:50:03,261 --> 00:50:07,128
No. That's a pretty insulting thing to say.

607
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:12,551
It's you that's the type not to make love
anywhere but in bed with the lights out.

608
00:50:12,687 --> 00:50:17,064
- Now who's being insulting?
- I suppose you'll undress and go to bed.

609
00:50:17,192 --> 00:50:19,480
Well, it's 1am.

610
00:50:20,737 --> 00:50:26,277
Let's try being honest. There's not much
passion left in this marriage, is there?

611
00:50:27,328 --> 00:50:30,198
- Is there not? I haven't noticed.
- Don't be so aloof.

612
00:50:30,331 --> 00:50:34,031
I'm trying to tell you something.
It's not erotic any more.

613
00:50:34,168 --> 00:50:36,706
- Well, was it ever?
- Was it not?

614
00:50:37,505 --> 00:50:39,663
Marion, I'm tired.

615
00:50:39,799 --> 00:50:43,547
We rarely sleep together any more,
and when we do it's by the book.

616
00:50:43,678 --> 00:50:47,925
It's the same routine. I know what
you're going to do and in what order.

617
00:50:48,058 --> 00:50:53,479
Yeah, it's true, we are both creatures of
routine. Now can we go to sleep? It's late.

618
00:50:53,981 --> 00:50:58,607
And could you please try not
to toss and talk in your sleep?

619
00:50:59,445 --> 00:51:04,570
Last night you kept saying "Larry". I
assume you dreamed about Larry Lewis.

620
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:07,451
<i>At the mention of Larry Lewis's name,</i>

621
00:51:07,579 --> 00:51:12,122
<i>I experienced odd feelings</i>
<i>of melancholy and longing.</i>

622
00:51:13,168 --> 00:51:15,789
<i>I wanted to weep in the dream,</i>

623
00:51:15,921 --> 00:51:18,791
<i>but the tears wouldn't come.</i>

624
00:51:19,549 --> 00:51:23,677
- Are you married?
- Yes. You knew I got married.

625
00:51:25,514 --> 00:51:27,553
Oh yes.

626
00:51:28,434 --> 00:51:30,391
Yes, I had heard that.

627
00:51:30,519 --> 00:51:33,852
Larry wants us to move back
to New York, but I don't.

628
00:51:33,981 --> 00:51:36,650
We've had such a nice time in Santa Fe.

629
00:51:37,652 --> 00:51:40,606
- Are you happy?
- I'm happy.

630
00:51:41,489 --> 00:51:45,617
Why don't I leave you two?
I'm sure you have a lot to talk about.

631
00:51:50,582 --> 00:51:54,247
I see your by-line
now and then in magazines.

632
00:51:55,129 --> 00:51:57,501
Did you read my novel?

633
00:51:57,631 --> 00:52:02,008
I have it, but I am embarrassed
to say I haven't read it yet.

634
00:52:02,136 --> 00:52:04,923
You inspired one of the characters.

635
00:52:05,056 --> 00:52:07,095
Oh?

636
00:52:07,225 --> 00:52:12,468
- I hope you weren't too rough on me.
- No. I wrote of you with great love.

637
00:52:14,608 --> 00:52:16,600
Your wife is lovely.

638
00:52:16,735 --> 00:52:19,854
Yes. I met her right after
you said goodbye to me.

639
00:52:19,988 --> 00:52:23,487
Her name's Jennifer.
She's also quite a good writer.

640
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:27,532
- Do you have any children?
- Yes.

641
00:52:28,038 --> 00:52:30,114
We have a daughter.

642
00:52:30,249 --> 00:52:34,377
It's been the greatest,
most beautiful experience of my life.

643
00:52:44,764 --> 00:52:47,302
Do you ever think of me?

644
00:52:47,434 --> 00:52:50,518
<i>(Larry)</i> Do you ever think of me?

645
00:52:50,646 --> 00:52:52,887
Once in a while.

646
00:52:54,608 --> 00:52:57,312
I hope you're happy with Ken.

647
00:52:57,861 --> 00:53:02,321
I ran into him on the street not too
long ago. He must have told you.

648
00:53:02,450 --> 00:53:05,700
I think of you more than once in a while.

649
00:53:06,454 --> 00:53:11,116
But without regret. Please,
don't tell me you have any regret.

650
00:53:11,251 --> 00:53:16,376
<i>(Claire)</i> Darling, come here for a moment.
I want to show you a beautiful sunset.

651
00:53:16,923 --> 00:53:19,378
Which character
in your novel did I inspire?

652
00:53:19,509 --> 00:53:22,794
Hlenka. I gave you
a beautiful name. Hlenka.

653
00:53:23,764 --> 00:53:26,089
I described our times together.

654
00:53:26,225 --> 00:53:28,716
You'll recognise it.

655
00:53:28,852 --> 00:53:31,343
I have to go now.

656
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:34,018
My wife needs me.

657
00:53:41,699 --> 00:53:44,450
Marion, please, don't cry.

658
00:53:44,786 --> 00:53:47,621
Although I am glad to hear
our little scene is moving.

659
00:53:47,747 --> 00:53:51,329
- I'd like to go home.
- And you will.

660
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:55,540
I just thought you might like
to see our second act finale.

661
00:53:55,672 --> 00:53:58,756
Your first husband's suicide scene.

662
00:53:59,635 --> 00:54:01,876
It's touching.

663
00:54:02,012 --> 00:54:04,051
Sam was not a suicide.

664
00:54:04,181 --> 00:54:08,344
How do you know? It was
15 years after you divorced.

665
00:54:09,729 --> 00:54:13,643
He died in his sleep from
mixing pills and alcohol.

666
00:54:14,442 --> 00:54:16,565
I was at his funeral.

667
00:54:16,695 --> 00:54:19,731
<i>(Jack)</i> Well, you know,
that's always a grey area.

668
00:54:19,865 --> 00:54:21,857
Alone in a hotel room,

669
00:54:21,992 --> 00:54:24,317
depressed...

670
00:54:24,453 --> 00:54:27,122
<i>(Marion)</i> Sam was a wonderful man.

671
00:54:28,207 --> 00:54:31,291
We had such lovely times together.

672
00:54:32,878 --> 00:54:35,285
You taught me so much.

673
00:54:35,423 --> 00:54:40,583
You were a wonderful pupil. Certainly
the most interesting one in my class.

674
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,258
Still, the age difference...

675
00:54:43,765 --> 00:54:47,216
I shouldn't have seduced you.
Intellectually, that is.

676
00:54:47,352 --> 00:54:50,222
I should have resisted that temptation.

677
00:54:50,647 --> 00:54:54,691
I shouldn't have made you adore me,
but you were such a dazzling pupil,

678
00:54:54,818 --> 00:54:57,522
the temptation was too great.

679
00:54:57,654 --> 00:55:00,323
And so I paid the price.

680
00:55:00,449 --> 00:55:02,987
We both paid the price.

681
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:07,994
Inevitably there comes a time when
the pupil absorbs all that he or she can.

682
00:55:08,833 --> 00:55:12,782
And what seemed like constant joyous
imparting of knowledge and opinions

683
00:55:12,921 --> 00:55:15,376
becomes suffocation.

684
00:55:16,091 --> 00:55:19,424
Ironically, that's what they
wrote on my death certificate.

685
00:55:19,553 --> 00:55:21,592
"Suffocation."

686
00:55:22,431 --> 00:55:24,423
Oh, Sam.

687
00:55:24,558 --> 00:55:29,101
<i>(Jack)</i> Wait, there's another important
scene between you and Sam.

688
00:55:29,229 --> 00:55:31,221
No.

689
00:55:31,357 --> 00:55:33,396
No more.

690

<i>That night we had what was</i>
<i>supposed to be a charming dinner</i>

691
00:55:40,158 --> 00:55:43,075
<i>with Tom and Eleanor Banks.</i>
<i>Doctor Banks.</i>

692
00:55:43,828 --> 00:55:48,454
<i>Everyone was full of energy, and</i>
<i>I must have seemed drab in contrast.</i>

693
00:55:49,501 --> 00:55:53,961
<i>Not only was I tired but the dream</i>
<i>had put me in a foul mood.</i>

694
00:56:01,013 --> 00:56:02,886
Tom and Eleanor are funny.

695
00:56:03,015 --> 00:56:06,847
All that carrying-on about ESP
and parapsychology.

696
00:56:06,978 --> 00:56:09,516
You'd think they'd be more sensible.

697
00:56:09,647 --> 00:56:13,858
And then when you put it down so
unequivocally, I thought they'd die.

698
00:56:13,985 --> 00:56:16,523
You were a little cruel, however correct.

699
00:56:16,654 --> 00:56:21,399
I was so tired, I was in a stinking mood.
And who knows? Maybe they're right.

700
00:56:21,535 --> 00:56:25,319
Maybe there is more to life than meets
the eye. What the hell do I know?

701
00:56:25,455 --> 00:56:30,793
Their beliefs are one step ahead of Ouija
boards. And all that talk about Greece!

702
00:56:30,919 --> 00:56:34,038
You'd think no one had sailed
round the Greek islands before.

703
00:56:34,173 --> 00:56:37,838
If we're so contemptuous of Tom and
Eleanor, why do we go out with them?

704
00:56:37,969 --> 00:56:43,176
It's just when they get on to certain topics.
Next week it'll be flying saucers.

705
00:56:43,307 --> 00:56:48,811
Why do we have to see people every night
anyway? We never spend any time alone.

706
00:56:48,938 --> 00:56:52,354
- Well, that's not so.
- Yes, it is so. Every night it's friends.

707
00:56:52,484 --> 00:56:55,853
Yours, mine, people we hardly know.

708
00:56:55,988 --> 00:56:57,861
We've known Tom and Eleanor for years.

709
00:56:57,990 --> 00:57:00,315
- And you don't even enjoy him.
- Of course I do.

710
00:57:00,451 --> 00:57:04,283
You've spoken contemptuously many
times because he's a radiologist,

711
00:57:04,413 --> 00:57:06,868
- which you don't take seriously.
- I'm joking.

712
00:57:06,999 --> 00:57:10,747
No, you're not. You disguise it
as joking, but you're serious.

713
00:57:10,878 --> 00:57:15,706
- You're trying to provoke an argument.
- Why are we afraid to be alone together?

714
00:57:15,842 --> 00:57:19,674
- I didn't think we were.
- Because we've nothing to say any more?

715
00:57:19,804 --> 00:57:20,717
We talk.

716
00:57:20,847 --> 00:57:23,598
Why go out with Mark and Lydia
on our anniversary anyway?

717
00:57:23,725 --> 00:57:27,141
If that's all that's bothering you,
we won't go.

718
00:57:27,271 --> 00:57:31,767
But neither should we drive all the way
to the hotel where we had our first tryst.

719
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:35,980
Don't do that. Don't make
something romantic sound infantile.

720
00:57:36,113 --> 00:57:39,316
OK, but it's the same level
of maturity as sex on the floor.

721
00:57:39,450 --> 00:57:42,404
We might as well have it on the floor.
We don't have it in bed.

722
00:57:42,537 --> 00:57:46,404
- I don't believe we're discussing this.
- Why've you stopped sleeping with me?

723
00:57:46,541 --> 00:57:51,582
We are simply going through a less active
period, that's all. It's not uncommon.

724
00:57:51,713 --> 00:57:54,251
Why? I just wanna know why.

725
00:57:55,175 --> 00:57:57,214
Why don't we just go to bed?

726
00:57:57,344 --> 00:58:00,760
There was a time that
we were dying to be together.

727
00:58:02,558 --> 00:58:06,507
Marion, you're still the most
desirable woman I know.

728
00:58:06,645 --> 00:58:10,856
But we won't make love tonight
because there'll be some excuse.

729
00:58:13,861 --> 00:58:18,357
I hadn't realised how much of that
had slipped away until today.

730
00:58:19,117 --> 00:58:23,945
I'm really sorry. If I've done
anything wrong, forgive me.

731
00:58:24,748 --> 00:58:27,832
I accept your condemnation.

00:58:41,724 --> 00:58:43,882
<i>(Sam) You were a wonderful pupil.</i>

734
00:58:44,018 --> 00:58:49,439
<i>Certainly the most interesting one</i>
<i>in my class. Still, the age difference...</i>

735
00:58:55,071 --> 00:58:56,481
I love you.

736
00:58:57,115 --> 00:58:59,487
I love you too.

737
00:59:03,288 --> 00:59:05,909
- Happy birthday.
- I told you not to bother.

738
00:59:06,041 --> 00:59:08,995
Oh, I wanted to. Open it.

739
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:17,591
While you were out I read your paper.
It was quite brilliantly written.

740
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:22,216
It's your work that's brilliant.
And more important, it's original.

741
00:59:23,727 --> 00:59:26,681
- What is it? From a play or something?
- Yes.

742
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:30,182
It's an original from a French
production of <i>La Gioconda.</i>

743
00:59:30,317 --> 00:59:33,353
- I love it.
- I thought you'd like it.

744
00:59:33,487 --> 00:59:36,571
It was all I could afford
from that great store.

<i>The following morning I realised I'd</i>
<i>forgotten to get Ken an anniversary gift.</i>

747
01:00:06,730 --> 01:00:10,514
<i>I thought it would be a simple thing,</i>
<i>but it took surprisingly long.</i>

748
01:00:10,651 --> 01:00:14,269
<i>The truth was I couldn't really</i>
<i>think of what he might like.</i>

749
01:00:14,405 --> 01:00:18,817
<i>After window-shopping for an hour or so,</i>
<i>I came across an old antiques store.</i>

750
01:00:18,952 --> 01:00:22,321
<i>At first I didn't think there'd be</i>
<i>anything special for him there,</i>

751
01:00:22,455 --> 01:00:25,456
<i>but somehow I was drawn to look further.</i>

752
01:00:25,583 --> 01:00:30,411
<i>The place was empty and dusty,</i>
<i>and in the back a radio was playing.</i>

753
01:00:31,006 --> 01:00:36,083
<i>It was full of odd pieces, and I found</i>
<i>browsing in it quite fascinating.</i>

<i>(Marion)</i> Excuse me. Are you all right?

756
01:01:14,510 --> 01:01:17,214
Thank you. I'm OK.

757
01:01:21,392 --> 01:01:23,633
Can I help you?

758
01:01:25,313 --> 01:01:30,390
I'm sorry. I don't know why
I'm so emotional. I was...

759
01:01:30,527 --> 01:01:32,566
Thank you.

760
01:01:32,946 --> 01:01:37,738
Thank you. I was... I was just
looking at that picture there, and I...

761
01:01:37,868 --> 01:01:40,240
And I just felt so sad.

762
01:01:40,371 --> 01:01:43,158
Oh, but this is a very optimistic work.

763
01:01:43,290 --> 01:01:47,833
You know, I saw the original
of this once. In fact, its title is <i>Hope.</i>

764
01:01:49,005 --> 01:01:54,165
I think, of all the paintings Klimt did
in that period, this is the most positive.

765
01:01:55,178 --> 01:01:57,217
I'm sorry.

766
01:02:00,392 --> 01:02:02,218
Are you an artist?

767
01:02:02,352 --> 01:02:05,471
Yes. Well, I used to do some
painting when I was younger.

768
01:02:05,606 --> 01:02:08,690
I was absolutely in love
with this whole school.

769
01:02:11,570 --> 01:02:15,947
It's funny. Just this morning I was
thinking about... that I missed painting.

770
01:02:16,075 --> 01:02:19,491
- I'd like to get back into it.
- Really?

771
01:02:23,249 --> 01:02:26,119
I guess we all imagine
what might have been.

772
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:30,207
But that was a long time ago.

773
01:02:31,466 --> 01:02:33,838
Well, anyway...

774
01:02:36,555 --> 01:02:39,840
- Are you feeling better now?
- Yes, I just wanna get some air.

775
01:02:39,975 --> 01:02:44,269
- What kind of paintings did you do?
- Watercolours, mostly.

776
01:02:46,607 --> 01:02:49,062
<i>We left the store and walked together.</i>

777
01:02:49,193 --> 01:02:52,063
<i>I wanted to know her better</i>
<i>without seeming pushy.</i>

778
01:02:52,196 --> 01:02:56,110
<i>We talked about art, and the discussion</i>
<i>seemed to cheer her a little.</i>

779
01:02:56,993 --> 01:03:00,409
<i>We stopped at a gallery and spent</i>
<i>time marvelling at the pictures,</i>

780
01:03:00,539 --> 01:03:05,533
<i>and I took a chance and invited her to</i>
<i>lunch. I was excited when she accepted.</i>

781
01:03:05,669 --> 01:03:10,165
<i>She suggested a little out-of-the-way</i>
<i>place that was charming and private.</i>

782
01:03:10,299 --> 01:03:14,628
<i>We ordered a bottle of wine, although</i>
<i>she hardly touched it, being pregnant.</i>

783
01:03:14,762 --> 01:03:17,383
<i>The result was that I wound up</i>
<i>drinking most of it,</i>

784
01:03:17,515 --> 01:03:22,758
<i>and while I really wanted to find out about</i>
<i>her it was me who did most of the talking.</i>

785
01:03:23,479 --> 01:03:25,518
50.

786
01:03:26,524 --> 01:03:29,394
I didn't think anything of turning 30.

787
01:03:33,865 --> 01:03:36,272
Everybody said I would.

788
01:03:36,743 --> 01:03:39,827
Then they said I'd be crushed turning 40.

789
01:03:40,914 --> 01:03:44,662
But they were wrong. I didn't
give it a second's thought.

790
01:03:47,129 --> 01:03:51,257
Then they said that I'd be
traumatised when I hit 50.

791
01:03:53,177 --> 01:03:55,632
And they were right.

792
01:03:58,141 --> 01:04:00,679
I'll tell you the truth.

793
01:04:01,686 --> 01:04:05,434
I don't think I've ever recovered
my balance since turning 50.

794
01:04:05,565 --> 01:04:08,103
Aw, gee, 50's not so old.

795
01:04:09,111 --> 01:04:11,566
No, I know it isn't, but...

796
01:04:13,032 --> 01:04:16,317
you just suddenly look up
and see where you are.

797
01:04:16,619 --> 01:04:19,192
You're in a good spot, aren't you?

798
01:04:21,624 --> 01:04:24,079
Well, I thought I was.

799
01:04:26,129 --> 01:04:30,043
And then there's chances gone by
you can't have back again.

800
01:04:30,175 --> 01:04:32,630
Well, like what?

801
01:04:33,178 --> 01:04:35,217
I don't know.

802
01:04:39,601 --> 01:04:42,471
Maybe it would be nice to have a child.

803
01:04:46,650 --> 01:04:48,975
You really think that?

804
01:04:53,616 --> 01:04:55,442
I do.

805
01:04:56,828 --> 01:05:00,410
I've never said it before, but I do.

806
01:05:02,626 --> 01:05:05,995
<i>(Sam) How arrogant! How</i>
<i>self-centred and feelingless!</i>

807
01:05:06,129 --> 01:05:08,086
I told you I didn't want a baby!

808
01:05:08,215 --> 01:05:10,503
What do you mean, "didn't want a baby"?

809
01:05:10,634 --> 01:05:14,631
- It was partly mine!
- Except it's my life that gets derailed.

810
01:05:14,763 --> 01:05:17,467
- I'm just destroyed!
- You go on doing what you want,

811
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:21,847
- and I have to stop and bring it up.
- But we'd share the responsibility.

812
01:05:21,979 --> 01:05:25,395
- You know it would devolve down to me.
- I wanted this baby!

813
01:05:25,525 --> 01:05:29,605
- I told you, it was not part of my plan.
- But you did it without consulting me.

814
01:05:29,738 --> 01:05:31,777
Consulting you?! It's my baby!

815
01:05:31,906 --> 01:05:35,820
Do I have to consult you for every move
I make? It's only your ego that's hurt.

816
01:05:35,952 --> 01:05:38,787
- You said you wanted children.
- I do, but not now.

817
01:05:38,914 --> 01:05:42,330
I don't have the future stretched
out in front of me indefinitely.

818
01:05:42,459 --> 01:05:46,587
It's easy for you to say. You've done
your work. I'm just starting out,

819
01:05:46,714 --> 01:05:50,047
trying to make something of myself!
It's not fair to the child.

820
01:05:50,176 --> 01:05:54,256
But you could do it without asking me! Or
giving me a chance to argue you out of it!

821
01:05:54,388 --> 01:05:59,928
I didn't want to be argued out of it. We've
talked this to death! lt-lt was unwanted!

822
01:06:00,061 --> 01:06:04,141
Do you want to bring a child
into this world? Really?

823
01:06:04,274 --> 01:06:06,432
You're the one that hates it so much,

824
01:06:06,568 --> 01:06:09,853
forever lecturing me on the
pointlessness of existence.

825
01:06:09,988 --> 01:06:13,024
- I hate you so!
- Let me go! Stop it!

826
01:06:13,158 --> 01:06:16,242
I can't stand this any more! Let me go!

827
01:06:16,370 --> 01:06:19,324
To be capable of such a lack of feeling!

828
01:06:19,457 --> 01:06:21,615
Knowing how I felt!

829
01:06:21,751 --> 01:06:23,874
Caring only about how <i>you</i> felt!

830
01:06:24,003 --> 01:06:27,087
Your career. Your life of the mind.

831
01:07:14,890 --> 01:07:18,389
<i>(woman)</i> I feel... I feel a little depressed.

832
01:07:20,271 --> 01:07:23,058
I met a really sad woman today.

833
01:07:23,816 --> 01:07:26,354
A woman you'd think
would have everything,

834
01:07:26,486 --> 01:07:29,356
and she doesn't. She has nothing.

835
01:07:30,073 --> 01:07:32,824
And it made me feel frightened.

836
01:07:33,535 --> 01:07:35,492
Because I feel...

837
01:07:35,620 --> 01:07:38,621
I feel if I don't stop myself,

838
01:07:38,749 --> 01:07:43,245
as the years go by,
I'm gonna wind up that way.

839
01:07:45,547 --> 01:07:48,251
She can't allow herself to feel.

840
01:07:48,384 --> 01:07:51,800
So the result is she's led this...

841
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:57,638
cold cerebral life, and... and has
alienated everyone around her.

842
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:02,271
Well, you know, we've
talked about this before,

843
01:08:02,398 --> 01:08:06,230
how I... how I only... only
hear and see what I want to.

844
01:08:06,695 --> 01:08:09,861
That's exactly what she does. She...

845
01:08:09,990 --> 01:08:13,738
She's pretended for so long
that everything's fine,

846
01:08:13,869 --> 01:08:17,653
but you can see clearly
how... how lost she is.

847
01:08:20,209 --> 01:08:24,420
She had an abortion years ago,
which she regrets.

848
01:08:24,547 --> 01:08:26,954
She rationalises it in many ways,

849
01:08:27,091 --> 01:08:32,251
but I think the truth is she was afraid of
the feelings she would have for a baby.

850
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:36,641
And she's a very bright woman,
very accomplished.

851
01:08:37,269 --> 01:08:42,939
But like me, she... Well, you know
emotions have always embarrassed me.

852
01:08:44,443 --> 01:08:47,230
I've run away from men
who I felt threatened me

853
01:08:47,363 --> 01:08:51,360
because the intensity of their
passion just frightens me.

854
01:08:54,245 --> 01:08:59,239
I guess you can't keep deep feelings
closed out for ever, you know, so...

855
01:08:59,375 --> 01:09:04,713
I just don't want to look up when I'm
her age and find my life is empty.

I saw you and Lydia in the restaurant
today. You didn't notice me, but...

871
01:11:09,304 --> 01:11:11,842
I watched the two of you.

872
01:11:14,059 --> 01:11:18,222
Afterwards I went walking for
a few hours to calm myself down.

873

Actually, if I'd had any perception,

874
01:11:25,821 --> 01:11:28,905
I would have been
suspicious from the start.

Because you and I committed adultery for
months when you were married to Kathy.

That was a very different situation.

877
01:11:40,295 --> 01:11:42,620
I don't think it was.

878
01:11:48,428 --> 01:11:53,422
I guess it wouldn't mean much if
I said to you that, um, it's passing.

879
01:11:55,936 --> 01:11:58,605
It was never very serious.

01:11:59,398 --> 01:12:03,230
And it was, uh, utterly foolish
of Lydia and myself.

881
01:12:05,321 --> 01:12:11,442
I feel sorry for you, Ken, because in your
way you've been as lonely as I have.

882
01:12:15,374 --> 01:12:17,746
Have we been lonely?

883
01:12:20,838 --> 01:12:23,708
At least I've come to recognise it.

884
01:12:28,554 --> 01:12:31,887
<i>The following days,</i>
<i>I didn't get any work done.</i>

885
01:12:32,016 --> 01:12:35,467
<i>Mostly I walked the streets</i>
<i>and just thought about my life,</i>

886
01:12:35,603 --> 01:12:38,010
<i>trying to put everything in order.</i>

887
01:12:38,148 --> 01:12:40,603
<i>I felt the need to talk to my brother Paul,</i>

888
01:12:40,734 --> 01:12:44,778
<i>who had made an important</i>
<i>decision about his life too.</i>

889
01:12:45,822 --> 01:12:49,273
Strange. Lynn and I go through hell
and we're staying together,

890
01:12:49,409 --> 01:12:52,493
you and Ken never fight
and you're breaking up.

891
01:12:54,206 --> 01:12:58,120
- So will you move out? Or will he?
- Oh, no, I will.

892
01:12:59,378 --> 01:13:02,082
I really do want a clean start.

893
01:13:02,215 --> 01:13:05,299
I wanna do a lot of things differently.

894
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:09,342
And that does mean between us, too.

895
01:13:10,682 --> 01:13:14,181
I'd like to spend a lot more
time with you and Lynn.

896
01:13:14,728 --> 01:13:17,515
I'd like to get to know everyone.

897
01:13:19,149 --> 01:13:21,687
If that's OK with you.

898
01:13:37,085 --> 01:13:40,039
So was it Dad's fault?
Did he do anything wrong?

899
01:13:40,171 --> 01:13:42,875
Oh, we both did, you know?

900
01:13:43,008 --> 01:13:46,092
I mean, I'm just as much
to blame as anybody.

901
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:49,590
- Maybe more.
- Well, it's too bad, you know.

902
01:13:51,016 --> 01:13:55,808
I just wanted to make sure that the
shock of it didn't upset you too badly.

903
01:13:55,938 --> 01:13:59,104
Well, I... to tell you the truth, I'm really...

904
01:13:59,233 --> 01:14:03,562
I'm not shocked, I'm just
surprised, you know? I mean...

905
01:14:04,989 --> 01:14:10,030
If I can be honest, I always felt there was
something between you two that was...

906
01:14:10,161 --> 01:14:15,914
I don't know. Maybe too comfortable,
or... that's not the right word. I don't...

907
01:14:16,042 --> 01:14:18,912
Just something, you know?

908
01:14:20,172 --> 01:14:24,300
Well, I hope that this isn't
going to have any bearing on us.

909
01:14:24,426 --> 01:14:26,714
I really value your friendship.

910
01:14:26,845 --> 01:14:29,252
Yeah, and I value yours.

911
01:14:40,193 --> 01:14:43,396
- Yes?
- Hello. I'm your next-door neighbour,

912
01:14:43,530 --> 01:14:47,610
and I thought you should know that
through some acoustical oddness

913
01:14:47,742 --> 01:14:51,158
- I can hear all your patients quite clearly.
- Really?

914
01:14:51,288 --> 01:14:56,709
Well, thank you. I'll take care of it. I've had
the problem before. I know what to do.

915
01:14:56,835 --> 01:15:01,627
By the way, you have a young woman
that you see. The pregnant one?

916
01:15:01,757 --> 01:15:05,375
I wonder if you could tell me
how I could get in touch with her.

917
01:15:05,511 --> 01:15:08,381
Oh, yes. She's terminated her treatment.

918
01:15:10,183 --> 01:15:15,557
She's gone away. I don't have any way of
reaching her. I'm afraid I can't say more.

919
01:15:18,817 --> 01:15:21,272
<i>I resumed work. It went well,</i>

920
01:15:21,403 --> 01:15:24,404
<i>and I was undisturbed</i>
<i>by extraneous distractions.</i>

921
01:15:24,531 --> 01:15:28,113
<i>The writing seemed to flow</i>
<i>and I was full of energy.</i>

922
01:15:28,244 --> 01:15:31,079
<i>Once on a sunny morning</i>
<i>I paused for a break</i>

923
01:15:31,205 --> 01:15:36,080
<i>and I thought I would look through</i>
<i>Larry Lewis's novel, which I'd never read.</i>

924
01:15:36,210 --> 01:15:41,666
<i>I was curious about the character Hlenka,</i>
<i>which was rumoured to be based on me.</i>

925
01:15:41,799 --> 01:15:44,468
<i>I opened the book, leafed through,</i>

926
01:15:44,594 --> 01:15:48,294
<i>and sat down as my eye</i>
<i>was caught by her name.</i>

927
01:15:55,981 --> 01:15:59,397
<i>"Hlenka and I accidentally</i>
<i>ran into one another one day</i>

928
01:15:59,526 --> 01:16:02,776
<i>while we were both</i>
<i>buying tickets to a concert. "

929
01:16:02,905 --> 01:16:07,234
<i>"I knew her because she was the</i>
<i>lover of a man I knew quite well. "

930
01:16:07,368 --> 01:16:12,445
<i>"Recently they had decided to marry.</i>
<i>This was a catastrophe for me personally,</i>

931
01:16:12,582 --> 01:16:17,576
<i>because from the moment he introduced</i>
<i>me to her, I was in love with her. "

932
01:16:18,672 --> 01:16:21,756
<i>"I convinced her to have a drink with me. "

933
01:16:21,883 --> 01:16:26,177
<i>"It was the only time I'd ever been</i>
<i>alone with her since we met. "

934
01:16:26,305 --> 01:16:30,552
<i>"She was lovely, and I spoke</i>
<i>too much and too rapidly</i>

935
01:16:30,684 --> 01:16:33,685
<i>because I was embarrassed</i>
<i>over my feelings toward her,</i>

936
01:16:33,813 --> 01:16:36,683
<i>which I felt were painfully obvious. "

937
01:16:38,443 --> 01:16:42,939
<i>"We walked around in Central Park</i>
<i>and talked about lots of things. "

938
01:16:43,072 --> 01:16:48,493
<i>"I told her about a book I was planning</i>
<i>to write, and my wanting to live out west. "

939
01:16:48,620 --> 01:16:51,704
<i>"She spoke enthusiastically</i>
<i>about her upcoming marriage,</i>

940
01:16:51,832 --> 01:16:54,323
<i>but I thought it was too enthusiastic,</i>

941
01:16:54,459 --> 01:16:58,670
<i>as if she were trying to convince</i>
<i>herself rather than me. "

942
01:16:59,506 --> 01:17:02,044
<i>"Soon it began to rain. "

943
01:17:02,593 --> 01:17:06,507
<i>"We ducked into an underpass</i>
<i>to avoid the cloudburst. "

944
01:17:07,223 --> 01:17:10,140
<i>"I remember thinking</i>
<i>how wonderful she was,</i>

945
01:17:10,268 --> 01:17:13,767
<i>and how beautiful she</i>
<i>looked at that moment. "

946
01:17:13,897 --> 01:17:19,057
<i>"And I wanted to tell her so many things</i>
<i>because my feelings were swirling so. "

947
01:17:19,736 --> 01:17:23,780
<i>"And I think she knew everything,</i>
<i>and that frightened her. "

948
01:17:23,907 --> 01:17:28,533
<i>"And yet some instinct told me that</i>
<i>if I kissed her she would respond. "

949
01:17:32,249 --> 01:17:35,084
<i>"Her kiss was full of desire,</i>

950
01:17:35,211 --> 01:17:39,707
<i>and I knew I couldn't share</i>
<i>that feeling with anyone else. "

951
01:17:43,219 --> 01:17:47,466
<i>"And then a wall went up, and just</i>
<i>as quickly I was screened out. "

952
01:17:47,599 --> 01:17:52,806
<i>"But it was too late, because I now knew</i>
<i>that she was capable of intense passion</i>

953
01:17:52,938 --> 01:17:56,638
<i>if she would one day</i>
<i>just allow herself to feel. "

954
01:17:59,153 --> 01:18:04,657
<i>I closed the book, and felt a strange</i>
<i>mixture of wistfulness and hope.</i>

955
01:18:06,118 --> 01:18:11,076
<i>And I wondered if a memory is something</i>
<i>you have or something you've lost.</i>

956
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:16,247
<i>For the first time in</i>
<i>a long time, I felt at peace.</i>

957
01:19:07,516 --> 01:19:10,932
