- Hey. Bob, what's up?
- <i>Hi. Listen.</i>

3
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:20,436
<i>According to an unconfirmed
report, David Wallace is dead.</i>

4
00:01:20,438 --> 00:01:23,705
What? No. No, no, no.

5
00:01:23,707 --> 00:01:27,341
No, It must be some sort of a
college prank or something.

6
00:01:27,343 --> 00:01:32,412
<i>Well, I thought if anybody knew whether
it was true or not, it'd be you.</i>

7
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,619
<i>Now a remembrance of writer
David Foster Wallace.</i>

8
00:01:39,621 --> 00:01:44,022
<i>He was found dead, an apparent
suicide, on Friday night.</i>

9
00:01:44,024 --> 00:01:47,091
<i>Wallace's novel,</i> Infinite
Jest, <i>brought him fame...</i>

10
00:01:47,093 --> 00:01:48,392
and a wide audience.

11
00:01:48,394 --> 00:01:50,960
Writer David Lipsky
has this appreciation.

12
00:01:54,265 --> 00:01:58,566
"To read David Foster Wallace was
to feel your eyelids pulled open."

13
00:02:00,101 --> 00:02:03,903
<i>Some writers specialize in the
'away from home' experience.</i>

14
00:02:03,905 --> 00:02:08,006
<i>They have safaried, eaten
across Italy, covered a war.</i>

15
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:12,510
<i>Wallace offered his alive self,</i>

16
00:02:12,512 --> 00:02:14,512
<i>cutting through
our sleepy aquarium,</i>

17
00:02:14,514 --> 00:02:18,482
<i>our standard TV, stores,
political campaigns.</i>

18
00:02:20,751 --> 00:02:24,386
<i>Writers who can do this...
Like Salinger and Fitzgerald...</i>

19
00:02:24,388 --> 00:02:27,155
<i>Forge an unbreakable bond
with readers.</i>

20
00:02:27,157 --> 00:02:31,291
<i>You didn't slip into the books
looking for a story, information,</i>

21
00:02:31,293 --> 00:02:34,327
<i>but for a particular
experience...</i>

22
00:02:34,329 --> 00:02:37,496
<i>The sensation,
for a certain number of pages,</i>

23
00:02:37,498 --> 00:02:40,765
<i>"of being David Foster Wallace."</i>

24
00:02:45,169 --> 00:02:48,404
<i>If anything, there was
a conscious attempt...</i>

25
00:02:48,406 --> 00:02:50,973
<i>to not give overt direction,</i>

26
00:02:50,975 --> 00:02:53,575
<i>although, of course,
you end up becoming yourself.</i>

27
00:02:54,944 --> 00:02:56,911
<i>Did they want you
to be a writer or no?</i>

28
00:02:56,913 --> 00:02:59,179
<i>No. I was gonna be... The big
thing, when I was little...</i>

29
00:02:59,181 --> 00:03:01,748
<i>I was... I was, like, a
really serious jock. Really?</i>

30
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,816
<i>Yeah. I played
citywide football as a kid.</i>

31
00:03:03,818 --> 00:03:06,885
<i>I was really big,
really strong as a kid.</i>

32
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:10,255
<i>And then for four or five years, I was
gonna be, like, a pro tennis player.</i>

33
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:12,190
<i>That was my great dream.</i>

34
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,891
<i>Reading was just
this kind of fun,</i>

35
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:16,593
<i>sort of weird thing
that I did on the side.</i>

36
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:27,268
"I didn't understand SoHo..."

37
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:31,471
The warehouses, the old
buildings, the cobbled streets.

38
00:03:31,473 --> 00:03:35,407
It wasn't the Upper East Side,
and it was dirty.

39
00:03:36,976 --> 00:03:38,476
I felt marooned.

40
00:03:38,478 --> 00:03:42,213
Our mother had taken us off the track
of the nice life we'd been on.

41
00:03:42,215 --> 00:03:45,316
She'd moored us in a creepy cul-de-sac
with her art-world friends.

42
00:03:45,318 --> 00:03:48,018
<i>None of the kids in my school
had parents in the art world.</i>

43
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,919
<i>It made me feel different,</i>

44
00:03:49,921 --> 00:03:51,854
<i>"like there was something
I had to cover up."</i>

45
00:03:53,557 --> 00:03:55,490
It was great. Sorry I missed it.

46
00:03:55,492 --> 00:03:57,758
Don't worry about it.

47
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,026
Hey. I heard you got
that<i> Rolling Stone</i> job.

48
00:04:00,028 --> 00:04:03,029
We'll see. I'm sort of on probation.
Good luck.

49
00:04:03,031 --> 00:04:05,631
Did you see Kirn's review
in<i> New York</i> magazine?

50
00:04:05,633 --> 00:04:07,899
The guy's been
fuckin' canonized.

51
00:04:07,901 --> 00:04:09,133
Sorry. Who's this?

52
00:04:09,135 --> 00:04:11,135
David Foster Wallace.

53
00:04:11,137 --> 00:04:13,604
"Next year's book awards have been
decided." Can you believe this?

54
00:04:13,606 --> 00:04:17,107
"The plaques and citations can now be
put into escrow." It's unbelievable.

55
00:04:17,109 --> 00:04:19,509
"With<i> Infinite Jest,</i>
by David Foster Wallace,

56
00:04:19,511 --> 00:04:23,979
a plutonium-dense, satirical quiz-kid opus
that runs to almost a thousand"... What?

57
00:04:23,981 --> 00:04:27,015
"a thousand pages,
not including footnotes,"

58
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:28,816
the competition
has been obliterated.

59
00:04:28,818 --> 00:04:31,418
It's as though Paul Bunyan
had joined the NFL...

60
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,420
or Wittgenstein
had gone onto<i> Jeopardy!.</i>

61
00:04:33,422 --> 00:04:36,589
"The novel is that colossally disruptive
and that spectacularly good."

62
00:04:36,591 --> 00:04:38,958
That's the fucking
opening paragraph.

63
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,793
What if it actually
is that good?

64
00:04:42,795 --> 00:04:45,530
You might just have to read it.

65
00:04:56,808 --> 00:04:58,141
Shit.

66
00:04:58,143 --> 00:04:59,876
Good piece. Thanks a lot.

67
00:05:01,345 --> 00:05:03,079
Solid piece. I'm fine with it.

68
00:05:03,081 --> 00:05:05,180
But you gotta clear it
with Legal, okay?

69
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:10,117
How many times have we interviewed
a writer in the last 10 years?

70
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:12,953
Take a guess.

71
00:05:12,955 --> 00:05:14,287
Uh, how many?

72
00:05:14,289 --> 00:05:16,822
Zero. I checked.

73
00:05:16,824 --> 00:05:18,723
Maybe because<i> Rolling Stone</i>
doesn't interview writers.

74
00:05:19,925 --> 00:05:22,493
There hasn't been a writer
like this. Okay?

75
00:05:22,495 --> 00:05:25,896
Once in a generation maybe.
Hemingway, Pynchon.

76
00:05:25,898 --> 00:05:28,398
Let me have this story.
What story?

77
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,467
He's finishing up a book tour,
and I want to go with him.

78
00:05:31,469 --> 00:05:33,101
That's not a story.

79
00:05:33,103 --> 00:05:36,637
He teaches at some small state
university somewhere in Illinois.

80
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,605
Please, Bob. Send me there.

81
00:05:38,607 --> 00:05:42,575
This is the sort of stuff I should be
doing, not 500 words on boy bands.

82
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,144
Talk to Jann.

83
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:01,190
There better be a story there.

84
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,661
There will be. There better.

85
00:07:38,716 --> 00:07:41,750
David, hi. It's David Lipsky.
<i>Where are you?</i>

86
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:44,119
I think I may have made
a wrong turn somewhere.

87
00:07:44,121 --> 00:07:46,621
Let's see. I am on
County Highway 29...

88
00:07:46,623 --> 00:07:49,223
just across
from the Circus Video.

89
00:07:49,225 --> 00:07:51,158
<i>How'd you get this number?</i>

90
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,861
Your publicist sent it
in her e-mail, just in case.

91
00:07:54,863 --> 00:07:57,997
<i>You'd do me a favor
by losing it.</i>

92
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:52,147
Stay. Be calm. Be calm. Stay.

93
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:57,451
Hey. You made it. Yeah.

94
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,052
Dave. Dave Wallace.

95
00:08:59,054 --> 00:09:01,654
David Lipsky. Hi.
It's a pleasure.

96
00:09:01,656 --> 00:09:03,822
Likewise.

97
00:09:03,824 --> 00:09:06,257
Um, I'm sorry about
the, uh... the phone call.

98
00:09:06,259 --> 00:09:07,424
No, you're fine.

99
00:09:07,426 --> 00:09:11,327
It was 95% joke.
Right, right. Yeah.

100
00:09:11,329 --> 00:09:14,596
Sorry in advance about the dogs.
They'll be slobbering all over you.

101
00:09:14,598 --> 00:09:16,364
I don't mind at all.
I love dogs.

102
00:09:16,366 --> 00:09:19,500
Oh, yeah? You haven't met these guys yet.
No, I love 'em.

103
00:09:19,502 --> 00:09:22,903
Let's, uh... Oh, Jesus. Let's get inside.
It's cold.

104
00:09:22,905 --> 00:09:25,705
Boys. Get in there.
Thanks a lot.

105
00:09:25,707 --> 00:09:27,973
Ooh. Come on. Come on, buddy.

106
00:09:27,975 --> 00:09:30,108
Wait. I'm very glad to meet you too.
Good dog.

107
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:32,710
Who's that? Oh, that's Jeeves.

108
00:09:32,712 --> 00:09:35,345
Hi. Yeah, that's
the Jeeve-meister.

109
00:09:35,347 --> 00:09:37,680
I got him 'cause he was so ugly.
Nobody else wanted him.

110
00:09:37,682 --> 00:09:39,348
Now he's, like,
a cover girl dog.

111
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:41,683
And that's Drone.
That's my provisional dog.

112
00:09:41,685 --> 00:09:44,118
Why? Why provisional?

113
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,487
He just showed up one day while
Jeeves and I were out jogging.

114
00:09:46,489 --> 00:09:49,089
The rest is history.

115
00:09:49,091 --> 00:09:51,958
I feel like I should
offer you tea or something.

116
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,894
Yeah. Yeah, thanks. That'd be great.
Yeah? Okay.

117
00:10:12,477 --> 00:10:14,778
Nice view.

118
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,180
Thank you. I can't
take credit for it.

119
00:10:18,182 --> 00:10:20,048
Huh.

120
00:10:22,751 --> 00:10:26,320
So, um, have you
always been unlisted?

121
00:10:27,622 --> 00:10:30,657
I had to do that recently. It
was getting kind of crazy.

122
00:10:30,659 --> 00:10:33,126
Oh. Because of...
Because of fans.

123
00:10:33,128 --> 00:10:35,661
I don't know if "fan" is
exactly the right word.

124
00:10:35,663 --> 00:10:39,331
I think what happened was I had forgotten to
tell my parents not to give my number out.

125
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,900
So it was people who had
tracked my parents down.

126
00:10:41,902 --> 00:10:45,103
I have this terrible problem. I really
hate to hurt people's feelings.

127
00:10:45,105 --> 00:10:48,272
Mmm, right. So I did
somethin' kind of cowardly.

128
00:10:48,274 --> 00:10:52,309
No. I don't think unlisting your
number is cowardly. Kind of is.

129
00:10:52,311 --> 00:10:55,078
I changed my number so these
folks couldn't find me anymore.

130
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,312
Right.

131
00:10:56,314 --> 00:10:58,747
There was this computer
operator from Vancouver.

132
00:10:58,749 --> 00:11:00,281
He was living in a
basement or something.

133
00:11:00,283 --> 00:11:04,083
I found him very moving. He was
in terrible, terrible pain.

134
00:11:04,085 --> 00:11:06,018
What did he want from you?

135
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,987
It's unclear. And when I
would, sorta like, ask him,

136
00:11:08,989 --> 00:11:12,156
that's when he would get angry,
and then it got scary.

137
00:11:12,158 --> 00:11:15,525
Right. What-What is this?
Who's the artist?

138
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,428
That's my friend's daughter.
Calls me chicken head.

139
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,163
I call her chicken head.

140
00:11:21,165 --> 00:11:23,798
It's her latest salvo
in the war.

141
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,034
Um, that's funny.
Would you mind if I...

142
00:11:27,036 --> 00:11:29,569
No. Do what you gotta do.
Thank you.

143
00:11:36,743 --> 00:11:41,612
Listen, before we start putting stuff
on tape, I need to ask you something.

144
00:11:41,614 --> 00:11:45,215
I need to know that anything that I
say five minutes later not to put in,

145
00:11:45,217 --> 00:11:47,483
that you're not gonna put it in.

146
00:11:48,117 --> 00:11:50,118
Absolutely.

147
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,221
Just given my level of fatigue
and my fuckup quotient lately,

148
00:11:53,223 --> 00:11:56,591
it's the only way I can see doin'
it and not... not going crazy.

149
00:11:56,593 --> 00:11:58,559
No. I completely understand.

150
00:12:00,529 --> 00:12:02,561
It's right back on, huh? Mmm.

151
00:12:04,297 --> 00:12:06,931
Uh, you agreed to the interview.

152
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:15,104
So this is your road, huh?

153
00:12:15,106 --> 00:12:16,939
Yeah, this is my road.

154
00:12:16,941 --> 00:12:19,641
You're gonna have to tell me where to turn.
I'm used to a grid system.

155
00:12:19,643 --> 00:12:21,476
This is all new
territory for me.

156
00:12:21,478 --> 00:12:24,612
Fair enough. You just go
straight for about a mile.

157
00:12:24,614 --> 00:12:26,714
There'll be signs for the
school on the right.

158
00:12:26,716 --> 00:12:29,483
Got it. Do you like
teaching there?

159
00:12:29,485 --> 00:12:32,819
I do. Yeah, very much.
Which is what's so fucked.

160
00:12:32,821 --> 00:12:35,655
I feel so bad for these kids.
Why do you feel bad for them?

161
00:12:35,657 --> 00:12:38,157
They have the greatest writing
teacher in the world.

162
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:41,293
If I was there, maybe.
The whole fuss...

163
00:12:41,295 --> 00:12:42,861
It's taken me out of school
for the past two weeks.

164
00:12:42,863 --> 00:12:44,596
And we gotta leave
again tomorrow.

165
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:47,265
We gotta be up at the crack
of dawn to go to the airport.

166
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:50,368
Oh, shit. Do we really? That's
what you signed on for, man.

167
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,703
You're welcome to stick around and
write an article about my dogs.

168
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:56,039
No, that's just fine. Might be
more interesting. I promise you.

169
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:59,108
Do yourself a favor. Don't
expect any fireworks in there.

170
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:00,976
I'm sure you're gonna
be just fine.

171
00:13:00,978 --> 00:13:03,178
Campus-romance story.

172
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:06,147
Ah! I gotta tell you guys,

173
00:13:06,149 --> 00:13:09,283
the average citizen is not gonna
find it that interesting.

174
00:13:09,285 --> 00:13:11,885
The great dread of creative
writing professors?

175
00:13:11,887 --> 00:13:16,522
"Their eyes met over the keg."

176
00:13:16,524 --> 00:13:18,924
I just want my narrator to be
funny and smart, you know?

177
00:13:18,926 --> 00:13:20,392
I know, I know. I get it.

178
00:13:20,394 --> 00:13:22,694
You want your narrator
to be funny and smart.

179
00:13:22,696 --> 00:13:24,262
Here's a tip.

180
00:13:24,264 --> 00:13:27,164
Have him say funny, smart things
some of the time.

181
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:28,331
Thank you.

182
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:29,865
You did a good job. Thank you.

183
00:13:29,867 --> 00:13:32,801
Um, all right, who's next?
Melissa.

184
00:13:32,803 --> 00:13:35,170
I'm normally a much better
teacher than that, I swear.

185
00:13:35,172 --> 00:13:37,739
I thought you were great and
that they obviously love you.

186
00:13:37,741 --> 00:13:39,107
Oh, yeah? Do you think?

187
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:41,476
Yeah, come on, you know they do.

188
00:13:41,478 --> 00:13:43,077
You hungry?

189
00:13:46,381 --> 00:13:48,014
<i>And what can I get you to drink?</i>

190
00:13:48,016 --> 00:13:52,151
I'll just have, like, a
giant Diet Rite, please.

191
00:13:52,153 --> 00:13:54,086
You know what,
I'll have the same thing.

192
00:13:54,088 --> 00:13:56,221
I'll be right back with your pop.
Thanks, man.

193
00:13:58,758 --> 00:14:01,258
Oh. Uh, can I, uh...

194
00:14:03,127 --> 00:14:06,262
Do you mind if I... One second.

195
00:14:07,765 --> 00:14:11,265
Uh...

196
00:14:12,967 --> 00:14:15,101
You don't drink.

197
00:14:18,905 --> 00:14:20,705
Is that a question to me?

198
00:14:20,707 --> 00:14:22,973
No. No, it's an observation.

199
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:26,376
Ah, I see. No, I know.
No, I do not drink.

200
00:14:26,378 --> 00:14:28,611
You can order whatever you want though.
Go right ahead.

201
00:14:28,613 --> 00:14:30,012
No, no. That's fine.

202
00:14:30,014 --> 00:14:32,914
I have a lot of friends who have
been through the program, so...

203
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:35,283
They always tell me that
they're uncomfortable...

204
00:14:35,285 --> 00:14:37,718
with people drinking
right in front of them.

205
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,586
So I just... Ah.

206
00:14:40,988 --> 00:14:45,424
I mean, out of respect, I...
I got what you got.

207
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:49,894
I'm not any sort of authority
on any sort of program.

208
00:14:49,896 --> 00:14:52,363
From my very limited
outside understanding,

209
00:14:52,365 --> 00:14:54,365
for people who have been
in it a while,

210
00:14:54,367 --> 00:14:57,601
you could snort cocaine off the back
of your hand, they'd be all right.

211
00:14:57,603 --> 00:14:59,536
Right. Right. Right.

212
00:15:00,704 --> 00:15:02,705
You know what I would love to do, man?
What's that?

213
00:15:02,707 --> 00:15:06,341
I would love to do a profile on one of
you guys who's doin' a profile on me.

214
00:15:06,343 --> 00:15:08,643
That is interesting. Is
that too pomo and cute?

215
00:15:08,645 --> 00:15:10,144
Maybe for<i> Rolling Stone.</i>

216
00:15:10,146 --> 00:15:13,380
It would be interesting though.
You think?

217
00:15:13,382 --> 00:15:15,749
I'm sorry, man. What's wrong?

218
00:15:15,751 --> 00:15:19,018
It's just you're gonna go back to
New York and sit at your desk...

219
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,854
and shape this thing
however you want.

220
00:15:21,856 --> 00:15:24,022
To me, it's just
extremely disturbing.

221
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:25,857
Why is it disturbing?

222
00:15:25,859 --> 00:15:29,727
Because I think I would like to shape the
impression of me that's coming across.

223
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:32,162
I don't even know
if I like you yet.

224
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:34,564
I'm so nervous about
whether you like me.

225
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:36,132
Here you go.

226
00:15:36,134 --> 00:15:38,000
Your food will be out soon.
Can I get you anything else?

227
00:15:38,002 --> 00:15:40,469
No, we're fine. Thank you.
Thanks.

228
00:15:40,471 --> 00:15:42,404
Um...

229
00:15:42,406 --> 00:15:44,839
What's this story about
in your mind?

230
00:15:44,841 --> 00:15:46,841
What does Jann want?

231
00:15:46,843 --> 00:15:49,410
Just what it's like to be the most
talked about writer in the country...

232
00:15:49,412 --> 00:15:52,179
or that sort of thing. Right.

233
00:15:52,181 --> 00:15:54,447
Which makes it sound...

234
00:15:54,449 --> 00:15:56,382
How do you learn
to do this stuff?

235
00:15:56,384 --> 00:15:59,084
Do what? The interviewing.

236
00:15:59,086 --> 00:16:01,219
Does one go
to interviewing school?

237
00:16:01,221 --> 00:16:03,688
Yes, I went to eight years
of interviewing school.

238
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,222
So you got a master's? I did.

239
00:16:05,224 --> 00:16:09,726
Um, no. No, I'm... I'm a writer.

240
00:16:09,728 --> 00:16:11,828
Uh, okay. Great. Yeah.

241
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:14,197
I mean I write fiction
as well. I...

242
00:16:15,332 --> 00:16:16,999
I just had a novel
published actually.

243
00:16:17,001 --> 00:16:19,668
Great. Yeah.

244
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,269
What's... What's that called?

245
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:24,071
<i>The Art Fair. The Art Fair.
</i> Great.

246
00:16:26,641 --> 00:16:30,110
And I had a collection
published a few years ago, so...

247
00:16:30,112 --> 00:16:31,945
You're, like,
a nervous guy, huh?

248
00:16:31,947 --> 00:16:35,214
No, no. No, I'm okay. How are you?
I... 'Cos I'm terrified.

249
00:16:35,216 --> 00:16:37,115
Are you? Yes. You're
not alone in this.

250
00:16:37,117 --> 00:16:38,683
Okay. We'll do this together.

251
00:16:38,685 --> 00:16:41,318
No, I think it's gonna
be a lot of fun. Yeah.

252
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,820
The thing about the tour
is, yes,

253
00:16:43,822 --> 00:16:46,455
I would like to get laid
off of it a couple of times.

254
00:16:46,457 --> 00:16:48,990
People come up.
They kind of, like, slither up.

255
00:16:48,992 --> 00:16:51,158
And it seems like...
I don't know.

256
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,426
What I want is not to have
to take any action.

257
00:16:53,428 --> 00:16:56,629
What kind of action? I don't
want to have to say, like,

258
00:16:56,631 --> 00:16:58,397
"Do you want to come
back to the hotel?"

259
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,066
I want them to say, "I am
coming back to your hotel."

260
00:17:01,068 --> 00:17:04,602
"Where is your hotel?" That would
be easier for you, wouldn't it?

261
00:17:04,604 --> 00:17:07,638
I can't stand to look like I'm
actively trading off this sexually.

262
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,973
Which, of course,
I'd be happy to do.

263
00:17:09,975 --> 00:17:12,475
I think, in retrospect, I'm
probably very lucky that I didn't.

264
00:17:12,477 --> 00:17:14,176
Lucky? Why?

265
00:17:14,178 --> 00:17:16,745
It just would have made me feel lonely.
You know?

266
00:17:16,747 --> 00:17:18,213
Lonely? How so?

267
00:17:18,215 --> 00:17:20,248
It wouldn't have had
anything to do with me.

268
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,850
I think it would have
been... just...

269
00:17:22,852 --> 00:17:25,552
Your fame? Yeah. Whatever.

270
00:17:25,554 --> 00:17:27,086
Your fame. You can say it.
Fine, fine.

271
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:29,421
You're famous. Okay, whatever.

272
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:32,457
You are. Except, though, if they're
responding to your work...

273
00:17:32,459 --> 00:17:33,724
and your work
is really personal,

274
00:17:33,726 --> 00:17:36,093
then reading you is another
way of meeting you.

275
00:17:36,095 --> 00:17:37,994
Isn't that right?

276
00:17:37,996 --> 00:17:39,528
That's so good. Thank you.

277
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:41,863
This piece will be excellent
if it's mostly you.

278
00:17:41,865 --> 00:17:44,498
Talk all you want, man. Save
me a whole lot of trouble.

279
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:56,740
Wow! So this is what
a real car feels like.

280
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,776
The one I got is like riding
around on a power lawn mower.

281
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:01,811
You know?

282
00:18:01,813 --> 00:18:04,446
Do you think being handsome has
anything to do with your success?

283
00:18:05,981 --> 00:18:07,715
- What?
- No, you're photogenic.

284
00:18:07,717 --> 00:18:09,950
You look good in your author's photo.
Come on.

285
00:18:09,952 --> 00:18:14,187
You have to come put me down if
I even start thinking that way.

286
00:18:14,189 --> 00:18:16,689
Thinking what way? What,
about how books are sold?

287
00:18:16,691 --> 00:18:20,392
Like, "Do you want to do
a<i> Rolling Stone</i> interview?"

288
00:18:20,394 --> 00:18:23,161
Do you want to do X?
Do you want to do Y?

289
00:18:23,163 --> 00:18:27,532
It really worries me that what I'm
doing right now is like being a whore.

290
00:18:27,534 --> 00:18:29,767
A whore? Hey. Why?

291
00:18:29,769 --> 00:18:33,837
Cashing in somehow or like getting
some little celebrity for myself...

292
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:37,707
that will, from some bizarre set of
misunderstandings, sell more copies of the book.

293
00:18:37,709 --> 00:18:41,177
- Mmm, okay.
- You can quote that if you want.

294
00:18:41,179 --> 00:18:43,846
Preferably in a context where I
don't sound like a total dweeb.

295
00:18:43,848 --> 00:18:46,181
Don't worry about it.

296
00:18:46,183 --> 00:18:49,651
By the way, are they gonna send
Annie Leibovitz to take pictures?

297
00:18:49,653 --> 00:18:53,186
I'm not sure. Possibly.
See how the story turns out.

298
00:18:55,355 --> 00:18:57,589
I know. You're a really
good-looking guy.

299
00:18:57,591 --> 00:19:00,325
We should have 'em photograph
you, say you're me.

300
00:19:00,327 --> 00:19:03,294
Maybe I'll finally end up
getting laid.

301
00:19:10,335 --> 00:19:11,835
You're gonna drink all that?

302
00:19:11,837 --> 00:19:14,237
I don't want to have to come back.
I wish they had a case.

303
00:19:14,239 --> 00:19:17,473
Actually,
that's a good idea. Um...

304
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,910
Get the marshmallow one
too, please.

305
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:25,279
All right. One?

306
00:19:25,281 --> 00:19:26,980
Two. Two. Of course.

307
00:19:26,982 --> 00:19:28,815
Why would I get one?
One second. Okay.

308
00:19:28,817 --> 00:19:31,217
Okay, all right. I think that's enough.
Come on.

309
00:19:31,219 --> 00:19:34,587
Hey, Kim. Hi. We'll
take all of these.

310
00:19:34,589 --> 00:19:37,656
- Please, let me.
- No, you don't have to pay for my shit.

311
00:19:37,658 --> 00:19:40,492
No, no. It's not coming out of my pocket.
I have an expense account.

312
00:19:42,061 --> 00:19:43,761
If you insist, yeah. Yeah.

313
00:19:52,103 --> 00:19:54,036
If we ate like this
all the time... Yeah?

314
00:19:54,038 --> 00:19:56,505
What would be wrong with that?
What would be wrong?

315
00:19:56,507 --> 00:19:58,640
Besides your teeth falling out
and getting really fat?

316
00:19:58,642 --> 00:20:00,541
It's got none of the
nourishment of real food,

317
00:20:00,543 --> 00:20:03,844
but it is real pleasurable masticating
and swallowing this stuff.

318
00:20:03,846 --> 00:20:05,879
Yes, it is. It's like seductive
commercial entertainment.

319
00:20:05,881 --> 00:20:09,115
Mmm, but what saves us is that most
entertainment is not very good.

320
00:20:09,117 --> 00:20:12,485
But what about good seductive commercial
entertainment like... like<i> Die Hard?</i>

321
00:20:12,487 --> 00:20:14,954
First<i> Die Hard?</i> Great film.
No, it's a brilliant film.

322
00:20:14,956 --> 00:20:17,756
The best. So good. Absolutely.

323
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:20,625
I think, if the book
is about anything,

324
00:20:20,627 --> 00:20:23,594
it's about the question
of "Why?" Right.

325
00:20:23,596 --> 00:20:25,629
"Why am I watching
all this shit?"

326
00:20:25,631 --> 00:20:29,165
It's not about the shit. It's about me.
Right. Yeah.

327
00:20:29,167 --> 00:20:31,467
So why am I doing it?

328
00:20:31,469 --> 00:20:33,869
And what's so American
about what I'm doing?

329
00:20:35,838 --> 00:20:40,140
The minute I start talking about this
stuff, it sounds, number one, very vague,

330
00:20:40,142 --> 00:20:42,008
and number two,
really reductive.

331
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:44,443
I don't think you're being
vague or reductive at all.

332
00:20:44,445 --> 00:20:47,312
Okay, because I don't have
a diagnosis...

333
00:20:47,314 --> 00:20:50,548
or a system of prescriptions
as to why we...

334
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:53,183
When I say "we," I mean
people just like you and me...

335
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:55,084
Mostly white,
upper middle class,

336
00:20:55,086 --> 00:20:58,554
obscenely well educated,
doing really interesting jobs,

337
00:20:58,556 --> 00:21:01,823
sitting in really expensive
chairs watching the best,

338
00:21:01,825 --> 00:21:05,759
most sophisticated electronic
equipment money can buy.

339
00:21:05,761 --> 00:21:09,562
Why do we feel so empty
and unhappy?

340
00:21:09,564 --> 00:21:12,898
Right. It's kind of like Hamlet
except with channel surfing.

341
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,901
I'm not saying that watching TV
is bad or a waste of your time...

342
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:19,971
any more than, like, masturbation
is bad or a waste of your time.

343
00:21:19,973 --> 00:21:22,106
It's a pleasurable way
to spend a few minutes.

344
00:21:22,108 --> 00:21:23,941
But if you're doing it
20 times a day...

345
00:21:23,943 --> 00:21:26,843
If your primary sexual relationship
is with your own hand,

346
00:21:26,845 --> 00:21:27,743
something is wrong.

347
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:30,078
Except at least
with masturbation,

348
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,879
some action is being
performed, right?

349
00:21:31,881 --> 00:21:34,781
Isn't that... That's better.

350
00:21:34,783 --> 00:21:37,683
Okay, you could make me look like
a real dick if you print this.

351
00:21:37,685 --> 00:21:41,520
No, I'm not going to, but, if
you can, speak into the mike.

352
00:21:41,522 --> 00:21:45,223
Yes, you're performing muscular movements
with your hand as you're jerking off.

353
00:21:45,225 --> 00:21:47,225
But what you're really doing,
I think,

354
00:21:47,227 --> 00:21:49,894
is you're running a movie
in your head.

355
00:21:49,896 --> 00:21:53,430
You're having a fantasy relationship
with somebody who is not real...

356
00:21:53,432 --> 00:21:55,832
strictly to stimulate
a neurological response.

357
00:21:55,834 --> 00:21:59,302
So as the Internet grows
in the next 10, 15 years...

358
00:21:59,304 --> 00:22:03,105
and virtual reality pornography
becomes a reality,

359
00:22:03,107 --> 00:22:07,209
we're gonna have to develop some
real machinery inside our guts...

360
00:22:07,211 --> 00:22:09,211
to turn off
pure, unalloyed pleasure.

361
00:22:09,213 --> 00:22:13,114
Or, I don't know about you, I'm
gonna have to leave the planet.

362
00:22:13,116 --> 00:22:16,450
'Cause the technology is just
gonna get better and better.

363
00:22:16,452 --> 00:22:18,985
And it's gonna get
easier and easier...

364
00:22:18,987 --> 00:22:21,721
and more and more convenient
and more and more pleasurable...

365
00:22:21,723 --> 00:22:25,691
to sit alone
with images on a screen...

366
00:22:25,693 --> 00:22:28,393
given to us by people who do not
love us but want our money.

367
00:22:28,395 --> 00:22:31,429
And that's fine in low doses,

368
00:22:31,431 --> 00:22:33,931
but if it's the basic
main staple of your diet,

369
00:22:33,933 --> 00:22:35,532
you're gonna die.

370
00:22:36,367 --> 00:22:38,534
Well, come on.

371
00:22:38,536 --> 00:22:43,038
In a meaningful way,
you're going to die.

372
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:50,077
Hey. Can I try that actually?

373
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:53,913
Yeah. It takes some getting used to.
Go ahead.

374
00:22:53,915 --> 00:22:55,247
Thanks.

375
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:56,915
It goes right there.
Yeah, I know.

376
00:23:00,085 --> 00:23:02,552
Mmm. That's, um...

377
00:23:04,821 --> 00:23:07,088
Actually, can I... Can I use
your bathroom for a second?

378
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:08,789
I believe it's unoccupied.

379
00:23:17,531 --> 00:23:18,797
Mm!

380
00:23:59,137 --> 00:24:01,471
Hey. Hey.

381
00:24:02,739 --> 00:24:04,906
So, do you not
have a television?

382
00:24:04,908 --> 00:24:08,042
I do not have a TV, no.
How come?

383
00:24:08,044 --> 00:24:10,911
Because if I had a TV, I
would watch it all the time.

384
00:24:10,913 --> 00:24:13,313
Ah. I don't even know if I
would watch it all the time,

385
00:24:13,315 --> 00:24:15,181
but it would be on all the time.

386
00:24:15,183 --> 00:24:18,484
My version of a fireplace... some sort
of source of warmth and light...

387
00:24:18,486 --> 00:24:20,886
in the corner, I'd
occasionally get sucked into.

388
00:24:20,888 --> 00:24:23,922
Did you watch a lot of TV
when you were a kid?

389
00:24:23,924 --> 00:24:26,391
Yeah, a lot. You?

390
00:24:26,393 --> 00:24:30,061
I, uh... Me? Yeah.
No, I did. I did.

391
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:36,366
But I moved in with a woman, and
she grew up without a television.

392
00:24:36,368 --> 00:24:39,335
So living with her for the
first month was like torture.

393
00:24:39,337 --> 00:24:42,771
But then I realized it was
probably the best thing for me.

394
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:46,007
Did you guys stay together?
It was complicated.

395
00:24:46,009 --> 00:24:48,009
Why?

396
00:24:48,011 --> 00:24:51,212
Well, I was seeing this woman,
and she moved to LA,

397
00:24:51,214 --> 00:24:54,882
so we theoretically broke up.

398
00:24:54,884 --> 00:24:57,217
Then I started seeing
this other woman.

399
00:24:57,219 --> 00:25:00,153
But then I started seeing the first woman
again. We tried the bicoastal thing.

400
00:25:00,155 --> 00:25:03,723
And let's just say the second woman
didn't take to that very well.

401
00:25:03,725 --> 00:25:06,058
It's so much easier having dogs.

402
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,692
I'm sure it is.

403
00:25:07,694 --> 00:25:10,227
Yes, you don't get laid, but
you don't have that feeling...

404
00:25:10,229 --> 00:25:12,529
like you're hurting their
feelings all the time.

405
00:25:12,531 --> 00:25:13,696
Right, right, right.

406
00:25:13,698 --> 00:25:15,497
I'd like to emphasize...

407
00:25:15,499 --> 00:25:18,533
Strictly platonic relationship
with the dogs.

408
00:25:18,535 --> 00:25:21,736
I'll make sure to highlight
that in the article, sure.

409
00:25:21,738 --> 00:25:24,537
Uh, so, you're not
dating anybody then?

410
00:25:26,072 --> 00:25:28,306
Seriously dating?
No. I'm out of practice.

411
00:25:28,308 --> 00:25:29,974
I wouldn't even know
what to say.

412
00:25:32,143 --> 00:25:34,043
Do you want to have kids?

413
00:25:34,045 --> 00:25:37,413
I think someday I would.
You? Yeah.

414
00:25:37,415 --> 00:25:40,783
Yeah, I think, eventually. Yeah.

415
00:25:40,785 --> 00:25:44,386
I think that writing books is a
little bit like raising children.

416
00:25:44,388 --> 00:25:46,287
You have to be careful though.

417
00:25:46,289 --> 00:25:49,089
It's okay to take pride
in the work,

418
00:25:49,091 --> 00:25:53,026
but I think it's bad to want the
glory to reflect back on you.

419
00:25:53,028 --> 00:25:55,995
It sounds like you're worried
about having children.

420
00:25:58,231 --> 00:26:00,465
I don't know that I want to say
anything more about that.

421
00:26:00,467 --> 00:26:02,467
If that's okay. That's fine.

422
00:26:02,469 --> 00:26:05,470
It's fine for us to joke about
getting laid on tour and stuff,

423
00:26:05,472 --> 00:26:08,873
but that's... that's about it.

424
00:26:08,875 --> 00:26:11,809
I just thought it'd be nice
to have someone...

425
00:26:11,811 --> 00:26:13,710
to be sharing all this
wonderful stuff with.

426
00:26:13,712 --> 00:26:16,079
That's it. Yeah.

427
00:26:16,081 --> 00:26:20,015
I'd really wished that I was
married the past couple weeks.

428
00:26:20,017 --> 00:26:21,616
You have?

429
00:26:23,118 --> 00:26:26,053
Yeah. Nobody else
really gets it, you know?

430
00:26:26,055 --> 00:26:28,755
Your friends who aren't
in the writing biz are just...

431
00:26:28,757 --> 00:26:31,958
They're awed by
your picture in<i> Time.</i>

432
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,893
Your agent and editor
are good people,

433
00:26:33,895 --> 00:26:36,662
but they have their own agendas.

434
00:26:36,664 --> 00:26:40,399
It's fun talking to you about it,
but you've got your own agenda too.

435
00:26:40,401 --> 00:26:43,335
- That's true.
- Certainly a set of interests that diverge from mine.

436
00:26:43,337 --> 00:26:45,203
That's true.

437
00:26:45,205 --> 00:26:49,707
So, yeah, it would be nice to have
somebody that you shared a life with...

438
00:26:49,709 --> 00:26:54,110
and allowed yourself to be happy and...
confused with.

439
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:56,745
Somebody to call when you
get back to the hotel.

440
00:26:59,715 --> 00:27:03,017
I got a question.
Why aren't you married, at 30?

441
00:27:04,686 --> 00:27:07,154
Why aren't you married, at 34?

442
00:27:07,156 --> 00:27:08,655
You first. Okay.

443
00:27:08,657 --> 00:27:11,758
Uh... I don't know.

444
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,494
I just think it's hard to
cast that role, you know,

445
00:27:14,496 --> 00:27:18,965
to fill it when you know it's
gonna be like 30 to 40 years.

446
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,734
To find someone who, whatever
mental landscape you're in,

447
00:27:22,736 --> 00:27:24,402
they're gonna be in it too.

448
00:27:24,404 --> 00:27:28,305
You have to find someone who will
fit any landscape you can imagine.

449
00:27:28,307 --> 00:27:29,639
I don't know.

450
00:27:29,641 --> 00:27:32,008
I can't put it
as well as you can,

451
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:34,877
you know, about
these mental landscapes.

452
00:27:34,879 --> 00:27:37,880
I just... I know that
I'm hard to be around.

453
00:27:37,882 --> 00:27:40,349
- No, I don't think so.
- I am.

454
00:27:40,351 --> 00:27:42,083
Why do you say that?

455
00:27:44,653 --> 00:27:46,987
When I want to be alone,
like, to write,

456
00:27:46,989 --> 00:27:48,788
I really do want to be alone.

457
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:52,224
I think if you dedicate
yourself to anything,

458
00:27:52,226 --> 00:27:55,694
one facet of that is that it makes
you very, very self-conscious.

459
00:27:55,696 --> 00:27:58,329
And you end up using people...

460
00:27:58,331 --> 00:28:00,831
Wanting them around
when you want them around...

461
00:28:00,833 --> 00:28:02,098
and then sending them away.

462
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,233
But that comes
with the territory...

463
00:28:04,235 --> 00:28:07,402
If you're gonna be a writer...
That kind of self-consciousness.

464
00:28:07,404 --> 00:28:08,870
There's good self-consciousness.

465
00:28:08,872 --> 00:28:12,406
Then there's also
a toxic, paralyzing,

466
00:28:12,408 --> 00:28:16,009
"raped by psychic bedouins" kind
of self-consciousness. Right.

467
00:28:16,011 --> 00:28:18,644
That is scary.
Yeah, that sounds worse.

468
00:28:18,646 --> 00:28:21,847
Can you do me a favor? Could you tell
me about that poster over there?

469
00:28:23,349 --> 00:28:27,085
Alanis? Yeah.

470
00:28:27,087 --> 00:28:30,154
I don't know. I guess I'm susceptible
like everybody else. Why?

471
00:28:30,156 --> 00:28:33,857
I mean, she's pretty, but
it's the only thing in there.

472
00:28:33,859 --> 00:28:37,360
She's pretty in a very sloppy,
very human way.

473
00:28:37,362 --> 00:28:41,663
She's got this squeaky,
orgasmic quality to her voice.

474
00:28:42,531 --> 00:28:45,065
You know, here's what it is.

475
00:28:45,067 --> 00:28:48,401
A lot of women in magazines are
pretty in a way that is not erotic...

476
00:28:48,403 --> 00:28:50,936
because they don't look like
anybody that you know.

477
00:28:50,938 --> 00:28:52,537
That's true.

478
00:28:52,539 --> 00:28:55,840
You can't imagine them putting a
quarter in a parking meter...

479
00:28:55,842 --> 00:28:57,808
or, like, eating
a bologna sandwich.

480
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:59,843
Whereas, Alanis Morissette,

481
00:28:59,845 --> 00:29:04,681
I can and have imagined her just, like,
chowing down on a bologna sandwich.

482
00:29:04,683 --> 00:29:08,251
- I find her absolutely riveting.
- Nice. How did you get into her? How did you get into her music?

483
00:29:08,253 --> 00:29:11,053
I was listening to this
cheesy Bloomington radio,

484
00:29:11,055 --> 00:29:12,988
and "I Want to Tell You"
came on.

485
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:15,657
"You Oughta Know." But right.

486
00:29:15,659 --> 00:29:17,325
I don't know what that means.

487
00:29:17,327 --> 00:29:20,061
<i>I Want to Tell You</i> is a book
that O.J. Simpson wrote.

488
00:29:20,063 --> 00:29:23,664
Ah! That's a different thing.
Yeah.

489
00:29:23,666 --> 00:29:26,633
Although, wouldn't it be funny if O.J.
Simpson sang "You Oughta Know"...

490
00:29:26,635 --> 00:29:29,268
and Alanis Morissette wrote a book
about not killing two people?

491
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:32,204
Oh, man.

492
00:29:32,206 --> 00:29:34,639
I tell you, if this whole
fuss, whatever,

493
00:29:34,641 --> 00:29:37,908
could get me a five-minute
cup of tea with her...

494
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:40,243
Yo. Why don't you
put out feelers...

495
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:42,278
and see if she'd be
willing to meet you?

496
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,314
Are you serious? I would never do that.
Why not?

497
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:48,150
I would be terrified.
Why, would you do that?

498
00:29:48,152 --> 00:29:50,952
If I were you, yeah,
I would do that.

499
00:29:50,954 --> 00:29:53,788
A date with Alanis Morissette?
What would I say?

500
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:57,657
"Hello, Miss Morissette.
What is it like to be you?"

501
00:29:57,659 --> 00:29:59,291
"I don't know.

502
00:29:59,293 --> 00:30:01,693
Shut up and get
the fuck away from me."

503
00:30:01,695 --> 00:30:04,162
That's that beautiful squeaky voice
you like. That's right. And orgasmic.

504
00:30:04,164 --> 00:30:05,963
But you would go
if she called you.

505
00:30:05,965 --> 00:30:08,598
"Hey, Dave, I'm at the Drake
in Chicago. Let's have tea."

506
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,700
This is gonna look ridiculous.

507
00:30:10,702 --> 00:30:13,269
It's gonna look like
I'm using<i> Rolling Stone...</i>

508
00:30:13,271 --> 00:30:14,803
as a vehicle to, like...

509
00:30:14,805 --> 00:30:17,238
- It's been used for worse.
- Yes, I would do it.

510
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,940
Okay? I would do it in a heartbeat.
Good.

511
00:30:19,942 --> 00:30:23,376
Perspiring heavily
the whole way,

512
00:30:23,378 --> 00:30:25,845
the whole time shoving Certs
into my mouth. Exactly.

513
00:30:25,847 --> 00:30:29,114
Freaking out. It would cause me
a week of absolute trauma.

514
00:30:29,116 --> 00:30:31,883
And, yes, I would do it
in a... in a heartbeat.

515
00:30:31,885 --> 00:30:33,718
Okay? Are you happy?
We got that?

516
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,352
It's on the record. Okay.

517
00:30:35,354 --> 00:30:38,221
Um...

518
00:30:38,223 --> 00:30:39,822
I like... Eh.

519
00:30:43,159 --> 00:30:45,927
I like talking to you
about this stuff.

520
00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:48,195
But we should...
We gotta be up early.

521
00:30:48,197 --> 00:30:50,163
Really? What time is it?
It's, like, 10:00.

522
00:30:50,165 --> 00:30:52,798
I think it's, like, 11:30,
dick brain.

523
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:57,602
Oh, shit. Jesus. I am so sorry.

524
00:30:57,604 --> 00:30:59,170
I totally lost track of time.

525
00:30:59,172 --> 00:31:01,739
What time do you want me
to pick you up tomorrow?

526
00:31:01,741 --> 00:31:03,373
Where you going?

527
00:31:03,375 --> 00:31:05,341
There's a motel down the road.
I think it's a Days Inn.

528
00:31:05,343 --> 00:31:08,477
Oh, no, you don't want
to stay there. Trust me.

529
00:31:10,947 --> 00:31:14,382
I got a guest-roomish place
you could stay in.

530
00:31:14,384 --> 00:31:15,983
No, I don't want to impose.

531
00:31:15,985 --> 00:31:18,018
Don't thank me. It's not much.

532
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,853
Okay.

533
00:31:21,455 --> 00:31:23,656
No, it's great. Thank you.

534
00:31:23,658 --> 00:31:25,524
I should probably clean some
of that shit off the bed.

535
00:31:25,526 --> 00:31:27,325
Right. Maximum comfort.

536
00:31:27,327 --> 00:31:28,626
Thanks.

537
00:31:28,628 --> 00:31:30,894
Definitely want
to change that sheet.

538
00:31:30,896 --> 00:31:33,696
No, it's fine. Thank you.

539
00:31:33,698 --> 00:31:36,298
Just throw it wherever.
Okay. Here you go.

540
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,100
Grab one side of this.
All right, thanks.

541
00:31:39,102 --> 00:31:42,603
And you want to change the
pillows or just keep them?

542
00:31:42,605 --> 00:31:46,106
I don't think you're going
to catch anything incurable.

543
00:31:46,108 --> 00:31:49,375
That's all right.
I got penicillin.

544
00:31:49,377 --> 00:31:51,276
Okay. You're good? Yeah.

545
00:31:51,278 --> 00:31:53,811
Do me a favor. Leave the
door open for the dogs.

546
00:31:53,813 --> 00:31:55,512
They like to wander
from room to room at night.

547
00:31:55,514 --> 00:31:58,114
If the door's closed, they'll eat it
to get through it if they have to.

548
00:31:58,116 --> 00:32:00,216
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

549
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:03,886
Okay, yeah. Okay. Good night.

550
00:32:03,888 --> 00:32:05,888
Good night. Thanks. Cool.

551
00:32:43,658 --> 00:32:46,393
Oh. All right.

552
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:53,465
Hey, buddy. Okay. How are ya?

553
00:32:53,467 --> 00:32:56,835
Okay. Hey. Oh. All right.

554
00:32:56,837 --> 00:32:59,537
Psst! Okay.

555
00:33:01,707 --> 00:33:04,540
All right. Thanks. Okay.

556
00:33:06,075 --> 00:33:09,210
All right. Okay.
Have a good night.

557
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,413
Okay.

558
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:39,299
Oh. Hey.

559
00:33:40,901 --> 00:33:42,668
If you want any, there's coffee.

560
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:44,569
I don't need caffeine
to wake up.

561
00:33:45,971 --> 00:33:49,139
Oh, but, uh, cigarettes?

562
00:33:49,141 --> 00:33:51,039
Brothers of the lung. Mmm.

563
00:33:53,409 --> 00:33:56,043
Do you want to split this with me?
It's my last one.

564
00:33:57,478 --> 00:33:59,979
Uh, no, thanks.

565
00:34:06,485 --> 00:34:08,052
Just... Here.

566
00:34:09,754 --> 00:34:13,623
<i>Mi</i> Pop-Tart<i> es su</i> Pop-Tart.

567
00:34:13,625 --> 00:34:16,492
Thanks. Try it.

568
00:34:16,494 --> 00:34:18,026
It's delicious, right?

569
00:34:18,028 --> 00:34:21,095
It's really good.

570
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:41,113
There's a Mitsubishi plant.

571
00:34:41,115 --> 00:34:42,681
Then there's a lot
of farm support.

572
00:34:42,683 --> 00:34:45,417
There's Ro-Tech, Anderson Seeds.

573
00:34:45,419 --> 00:34:48,720
What are you doing here? I mean,
why are you not in New York?

574
00:34:48,722 --> 00:34:52,957
Every time I go to New York,
I get caught up in this...

575
00:34:52,959 --> 00:34:57,661
There's this enormous hiss of egos at
various states of inflation and deflation.

576
00:34:59,031 --> 00:35:03,099
Yeah. Hey, um, sorry.
I gotta do this.

577
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,201
Okay.

578
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:08,470
So, I gotta ask.
What is with the bandanna?

579
00:35:09,705 --> 00:35:11,539
What? What do you mean?

580
00:35:11,541 --> 00:35:15,975
No, people think it's your way of
connecting to a younger reading audience.

581
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:19,077
Is that what people think?

582
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:21,946
I don't see many Gen Xers
wearing them. Geez.

583
00:35:21,948 --> 00:35:24,014
I kinda wish you hadn't
brought this up, man.

584
00:35:24,016 --> 00:35:26,683
I'm sorry about that. Why?

585
00:35:26,685 --> 00:35:29,519
Because now I'm worried
it's going to seem intentional.

586
00:35:29,521 --> 00:35:31,587
Like, if I don't wear it,
am I not wearing it...

587
00:35:31,589 --> 00:35:34,656
because I'm bowing to other people's
perception that it's a commercial choice?

588
00:35:34,658 --> 00:35:37,492
Or do I do what I wanna do even though
it's perceived as a commercial choice?

589
00:35:37,494 --> 00:35:40,761
It's like a whole crazy circle
I gotta go around in now.

590
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:42,696
Come on. Sorry.

591
00:35:42,698 --> 00:35:45,331
When did you start wearing them?

592
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:47,933
In Tucson. It was, like,
a hundred degrees all the time.

593
00:35:47,935 --> 00:35:51,569
I would perspire so heavily, drip
into the electric typewriter.

594
00:35:51,571 --> 00:35:54,238
I was nervous I was gonna
give myself a shock.

595
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,375
And then, at some point, I realized
I felt better with them on.

596
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:02,878
I know that it's a security blanket
for me whenever I feel nervous...

597
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,314
or, like, I gotta
keep myself together.

598
00:36:06,316 --> 00:36:08,983
Makes me feel kind of creepy,
people view it as an affectation...

599
00:36:08,985 --> 00:36:10,217
or a trademark or something.

600
00:36:10,219 --> 00:36:12,085
It's more of a foible,

601
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:15,188
the recognition of a weakness that I'm
kind of afraid my head is gonna explode.

602
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:16,722
Right.

603
00:36:22,061 --> 00:36:24,228
Your parents are both academics.
Is that right?

604
00:36:25,096 --> 00:36:27,730
My dad, philosophy.
My mom, English.

605
00:36:27,732 --> 00:36:29,798
So. You?

606
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,400
Me? Yeah.

607
00:36:32,402 --> 00:36:36,137
My dad is in advertising,
and my mom's a painter.

608
00:36:36,139 --> 00:36:39,140
When they split up, I moved
in with her to SoHo,

609
00:36:39,142 --> 00:36:40,474
and my brother
moved in with my dad.

610
00:36:40,476 --> 00:36:42,776
Sounds like
there's a story there.

611
00:36:42,778 --> 00:36:45,578
Oh, there is.
I... I just wrote it.

612
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:49,348
What was it like, you know, growing
up in a house divided like that?

613
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:52,718
Hey. Who's interviewing who?

614
00:36:56,489 --> 00:36:59,390
How old were you when you
started writing fiction?

615
00:36:59,392 --> 00:37:01,058
Like, 21. Something like that.

616
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:02,893
Really? Never before?

617
00:37:02,895 --> 00:37:05,929
I think I started a World War
II novel when I was nine.

618
00:37:05,931 --> 00:37:08,364
Did you? That's very ambitious.
Thank you.

619
00:37:08,366 --> 00:37:11,533
It was so good, some of my best work.
Come on.

620
00:37:11,535 --> 00:37:14,202
It was about people with
hyperdeveloped skills and powers...

621
00:37:14,204 --> 00:37:16,437
going to invade Hitler's bunker.

622
00:37:16,439 --> 00:37:17,805
Very nice.

623
00:37:17,807 --> 00:37:21,241
Then, in college, I wrote a couple
of papers for other people.

624
00:37:21,243 --> 00:37:24,076
Really? People paid you to
write their papers for them?

625
00:37:25,378 --> 00:37:27,779
I wouldn't put it that coarsely.
How would you...

626
00:37:27,781 --> 00:37:30,948
There was a complicated
system of rewards. I see.

627
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:32,649
I would read two or three
of their papers...

628
00:37:32,651 --> 00:37:34,717
and get a sense of what
their music was like.

629
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:37,486
At some point, I realized
I'm really good at this.

630
00:37:37,488 --> 00:37:40,088
I'm like a strange kind
of forger.

631
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:42,123
I can sort of sound
like anybody.

632
00:37:42,125 --> 00:37:45,059
It's kind of scary. Um...

633
00:37:45,061 --> 00:37:47,694
Odds are I'm gonna want
to interview your parents.

634
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:52,665
What for? Just
biographical stuff.

635
00:37:52,667 --> 00:37:54,266
Right.

636
00:37:55,368 --> 00:37:57,635
I hereby request that you don't.

637
00:37:57,637 --> 00:38:00,471
Really? They're very
private people.

638
00:38:00,473 --> 00:38:03,841
And so I would have a problem with that.
Mmm, okay.

639
00:38:03,843 --> 00:38:06,043
So, no, you may not.

640
00:38:07,178 --> 00:38:09,779
Okay. I may not.

641
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:20,254
<i>Now boarding,
Flight 54 to Minneapolis.</i>

642
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:24,324
Ticket. Thank you.

643
00:38:29,529 --> 00:38:32,130
Crap jobs? Oh, man.

644
00:38:32,132 --> 00:38:36,300
I was a security guard at a software
company for three and a half months.

645
00:38:36,302 --> 00:38:40,470
Really? I walked around in
this polyester uniform...

646
00:38:40,472 --> 00:38:43,339
under these fluorescent
lights, twirling a baton,

647
00:38:43,341 --> 00:38:45,774
checking in on the walkie
every 10 minutes.

648
00:38:45,776 --> 00:38:47,542
"All clear at this cubicle."

649
00:38:47,544 --> 00:38:51,012
It was like every bad '60s novel
about meaningless authority.

650
00:38:51,014 --> 00:38:54,682
You're thinking, "My God, I had two books
come out in my early 20s, and here I am."

651
00:38:54,684 --> 00:38:58,419
No. No, as a matter of fact, one of
the things I liked about that job...

652
00:38:58,421 --> 00:39:00,821
is that I walked around not thinking.
Really?

653
00:39:00,823 --> 00:39:05,525
Mmm, in a very, like, "Huh. A
ceiling tile" sort of way.

654
00:39:05,527 --> 00:39:08,528
And what about after the security
guard thing? Was there anything else?

655
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:10,696
Oh, this is the worst. What?

656
00:39:10,698 --> 00:39:12,564
Get this down. I am.

657
00:39:12,566 --> 00:39:16,034
I was a towel boy at this chichi
health club. You were a towel boy?

658
00:39:16,036 --> 00:39:18,703
I was called something other than a towel
boy. I was, in effect, a towel boy.

659
00:39:18,705 --> 00:39:22,473
Occasionally trusted with checking
people in. "Show your ID."

660
00:39:22,475 --> 00:39:24,408
Anyway, one day
I'm sitting there.

661
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:26,743
Who should walk in to get
their towel but this guy,

662
00:39:26,745 --> 00:39:30,579
this writer that I knew who won a Whiting
writer's award the same year I had.

663
00:39:30,581 --> 00:39:32,080
Oh, God. Yeah.

664
00:39:32,082 --> 00:39:34,482
So there I am.
I'm sitting there.

665
00:39:34,484 --> 00:39:36,684
I'd been on a rostrum with
this guy... Holy shit.

666
00:39:36,686 --> 00:39:38,952
Having Eudora Welty
give us an award.

667
00:39:38,954 --> 00:39:41,020
Two years later,
I'm sitting there...

668
00:39:41,022 --> 00:39:44,256
It's the first time I remember ever
actively diving under something...

669
00:39:44,258 --> 00:39:45,757
to have somebody
avoid seeing me.

670
00:39:45,759 --> 00:39:47,592
You dove under a table?
Something like that.

671
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:51,262
Did you think you were done? I thought
life was over. I was pretty sure.

672
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:53,330
And was this after
your suicide watch?

673
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:00,035
Okay, how do you
know about that?

674
00:40:00,037 --> 00:40:02,637
I... I read about it somewhere.

675
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:05,906
This was McLean's, right?
How long were you there?

676
00:40:05,908 --> 00:40:09,442
I was there for eight days.
And why were you there?

677
00:40:09,444 --> 00:40:12,578
Because I was probably afraid
that I would do something stupid.

678
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:14,178
Okay.

679
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:19,816
I had a friend in high school
who tried to kill himself...

680
00:40:19,818 --> 00:40:22,185
by sitting in a garage
with the car running.

681
00:40:22,187 --> 00:40:23,986
And what it turned out was
he didn't die.

682
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:25,921
It just really
fucked up his brain.

683
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:27,889
And I, you know...

684
00:40:27,891 --> 00:40:31,559
I knew that if anyone was fated to
fuck up a suicide attempt, it was me.

685
00:40:31,561 --> 00:40:34,161
So there you are.
You're still in your 20s.

686
00:40:34,163 --> 00:40:36,329
My late 20s.
Okay, your late 20s.

687
00:40:36,331 --> 00:40:38,798
And you're in
some kind of pain...

688
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,734
about your desire to become some
sort of successful literary person.

689
00:40:41,736 --> 00:40:45,370
I think that the not very sophisticated
diagnosis is that I was depressed.

690
00:40:46,105 --> 00:40:47,872
Okay.

691
00:40:47,874 --> 00:40:52,342
Okay. At that point, my ego was
all tied up in my writing.

692
00:40:52,344 --> 00:40:55,111
It's the only thing
that I'd gotten any, like,

693
00:40:55,113 --> 00:40:57,713
food pellets
from the universe for.

694
00:40:57,715 --> 00:40:59,681
And I felt very trapped.

695
00:40:59,683 --> 00:41:02,350
"Oh, my five years are up
and I gotta move on.

696
00:41:02,352 --> 00:41:04,952
I don't want to move on."

697
00:41:04,954 --> 00:41:06,720
And I felt stuck.

698
00:41:08,489 --> 00:41:11,190
And it's not like I felt stuck
because I drank, okay?

699
00:41:11,192 --> 00:41:15,893
It was like I felt
my life was over at 28,

700
00:41:15,895 --> 00:41:17,895
and I felt really bad.

701
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:21,898
I did not want to feel that,
so I did all sorts of stuff.

702
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,966
I would drink real heavy.

703
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:26,969
I would... fuck strangers.

704
00:41:26,971 --> 00:41:29,838
Sometimes I would not drink at all,
not drink at all for two weeks.

705
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:33,974
Instead, I would run 10 miles
every morning in a desperate...

706
00:41:36,345 --> 00:41:39,012
Like, a very American...

707
00:41:39,014 --> 00:41:43,950
"I will fix this somehow by taking
radical action" sort of thing.

708
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:49,988
And here you are promoting
this acclaimed book.

709
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:51,756
That's not bad.

710
00:41:57,228 --> 00:42:00,263
David, this is nice.

711
00:42:00,265 --> 00:42:02,365
This is not real.

712
00:42:11,407 --> 00:42:13,408
By the way, an escort is
supposed to pick me up...

713
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:15,843
and escort me to the reading.

714
00:42:15,845 --> 00:42:19,413
Of course, when I hear "escort," I
picture, like, full geisha and hair...

715
00:42:19,415 --> 00:42:21,014
Of course, right.

716
00:42:21,016 --> 00:42:23,783
Take you to the bookstore and
take you back to the hotel,

717
00:42:23,785 --> 00:42:26,786
walk on your back and then
just fuck your eyeballs out.

718
00:42:26,788 --> 00:42:29,555
I think that's her.
Ah, just as I pictured.

719
00:42:29,557 --> 00:42:32,291
Mr. Wallace. Just "Dave."

720
00:42:32,293 --> 00:42:35,127
I recognize you from
your photograph. Okay.

721
00:42:35,129 --> 00:42:36,528
I'm Patty Gundersson.

722
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:38,596
And welcome to Minneapolis.

723
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:41,365
Thank you, Patty. Hi. I'm David Lipsky.
How are you?

724
00:42:41,367 --> 00:42:44,101
Hi. Okay. David and David.
That's easy.

725
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:46,603
- It's the Twin Cities, so...
- Hmm.

726
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:49,238
We only just met. He's
writing a piece on the tour.

727
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:53,508
- Should we get going?
- Yes. Come on. Come on. Great.

728
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:55,443
How's your morning, Patty?
Oh, it's good.

729
00:42:55,445 --> 00:42:57,545
How about you guys?
Was the flight all right?

730
00:43:04,152 --> 00:43:08,487
You would not believe the
famous people I've driven.

731
00:43:08,489 --> 00:43:11,289
Shirley MacLaine when she
was on her book tour.

732
00:43:11,291 --> 00:43:14,158
Ron Wood, you know,
of the Rolling Stones.

733
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,559
Of course. Yeah. Wow.

734
00:43:15,561 --> 00:43:18,595
Peter O'Toole. Oh, my gosh.

735
00:43:18,597 --> 00:43:20,530
Very thin, but delightful.

736
00:43:20,532 --> 00:43:22,398
Hey! Look, there's the
Mary Tyler Moore statue.

737
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,099
Yeah, there it is.

738
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,500
Did you want to stop?

739
00:43:25,502 --> 00:43:27,635
Oh. No, it's fine.

740
00:43:27,637 --> 00:43:29,403
Thank you. Are you sure?

741
00:43:29,405 --> 00:43:32,639
Everybody who comes here, that's
the first thing they want to see.

742
00:43:32,641 --> 00:43:35,942
"Where did Mary Tyler Moore
throw her hat up in the air?"

743
00:43:35,944 --> 00:43:37,643
It's really one of our
biggest attractions.

744
00:43:37,645 --> 00:43:39,544
Are you sure you don't
want me to stop?

745
00:43:39,546 --> 00:43:43,781
Definitely. No.
Thank you though.

746
00:43:43,783 --> 00:43:46,083
Trust me. This is about
as sexy as the tour gets.

747
00:43:47,319 --> 00:43:49,252
Mr.... Uh, Lipsky.

748
00:43:49,254 --> 00:43:52,154
L-I-P-S-K-Y.

749
00:43:52,156 --> 00:43:54,189
I've got you
in a standard double.

750
00:43:54,191 --> 00:43:56,724
And Mr. Wallace? Yes.

751
00:43:56,726 --> 00:43:58,726
You have a room with twins.

752
00:43:58,728 --> 00:44:02,028
Ah, yes. Anita and Consuela.

753
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:04,697
Excuse me?

754
00:44:09,001 --> 00:44:11,235
All right, man. I'll see you soon.
I'm gonna take a nap.

755
00:44:11,237 --> 00:44:13,704
Oh. Uh...

756
00:44:14,872 --> 00:44:16,272
Yeah.

757
00:44:16,274 --> 00:44:18,474
<i>What does he say
about the heroin rumors?</i>

758
00:44:18,476 --> 00:44:20,409
I haven't gotten to that.

759
00:44:20,411 --> 00:44:22,144
<i>What are you waiting for?</i>

760
00:44:22,146 --> 00:44:25,413
What am I supposed to say? "Is it
true you were a heroin addict?"

761
00:44:25,415 --> 00:44:27,515
<i>Yes. That's your story.</i>

762
00:44:27,517 --> 00:44:29,917
Okay, well, that's... It's hard.

763
00:44:29,919 --> 00:44:33,620
<i>Why, because you like him?
</i> Yeah. Yes.

764
00:44:33,622 --> 00:44:35,989
<i>David, you gotta press him.
</i> Okay.

765
00:44:35,991 --> 00:44:38,691
<i>Be a prick if you have to. You're
not his best buddy.</i> I know.

766
00:44:38,693 --> 00:44:40,559
<i>You're a reporter.</i>
All right. Bye.

767
00:44:51,735 --> 00:44:53,635
It's right up here.

768
00:44:56,338 --> 00:44:57,937
Ready?

769
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:03,541
- Ah!
- There he is.

770
00:45:03,543 --> 00:45:04,775
I can't believe
you guys actually came.

771
00:45:04,777 --> 00:45:07,077
Yeah, of course. Hi. Hi.

772
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,812
Wouldn't miss it. Hello.

773
00:45:08,814 --> 00:45:11,347
Gluttons for punishment, both of you.
I know.

774
00:45:11,349 --> 00:45:15,217
Uh, this is Dave Lipsky. He's a
reporter from<i> Rolling Stone.</i>

775
00:45:15,219 --> 00:45:17,052
Yes. Hi. Oh.

776
00:45:17,054 --> 00:45:19,120
This is Julie. Hi. Nice
to meet you, Julie.

777
00:45:19,122 --> 00:45:20,988
Great to meet you.

778
00:45:20,990 --> 00:45:22,589
And, uh... This is Betsy.

779
00:45:22,591 --> 00:45:24,424
Betsy and I went
to grad school together.

780
00:45:24,426 --> 00:45:26,392
How nice. Nice to
meet you, Betsy.

781
00:45:26,394 --> 00:45:28,127
And, Julie, how do you...

782
00:45:28,129 --> 00:45:30,662
Julie... Here, turn this on.
This is on, right?

783
00:45:30,664 --> 00:45:32,530
It is. Why? Go ahead.
Do you wanna...

784
00:45:32,532 --> 00:45:35,266
I'll do it. Julie wrote
me a fan letter.

785
00:45:35,268 --> 00:45:36,734
Really? Mm-hmm.

786
00:45:36,736 --> 00:45:39,169
I really did. I... Yeah.

787
00:45:39,171 --> 00:45:42,071
I was the books editor at<i> City
Pages,</i> and I wrote him a fan letter.

788
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:44,206
Julie's worked with
a whole lot of writers.

789
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:46,474
So I was very discriminating.

790
00:45:46,476 --> 00:45:49,243
And then it turned out that we
actually like each other as people.

791
00:45:49,245 --> 00:45:52,112
Indeed. That's actually what
happened with Jon Franzen and me.

792
00:45:52,114 --> 00:45:55,014
I wrote him a fan letter. Turns
out writers are real pushovers...

793
00:45:55,016 --> 00:45:56,715
when it comes to flattery.

794
00:45:56,717 --> 00:45:58,316
So you could try that sometime.

795
00:45:58,318 --> 00:46:00,551
I got it. Very subtle.

796
00:46:00,553 --> 00:46:03,954
Friends of friends who
have friends, as well,

797
00:46:03,956 --> 00:46:05,822
who actually know who... Cookies?

798
00:46:05,824 --> 00:46:08,391
Oh, no. Thanks a lot.
Oh, no. Thank you.

799
00:46:08,393 --> 00:46:09,792
Cookies?

800
00:46:09,794 --> 00:46:13,228
Really? Yes, and I've actually
been sworn to secrecy.

801
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:16,430
Are you sure I can't get
you something to drink?

802
00:46:17,432 --> 00:46:19,533
Do you have any artificial spit?

803
00:46:19,535 --> 00:46:22,702
I don't know why
you guys are laughing.

804
00:46:22,704 --> 00:46:24,804
It's an actual
pharmaceutical product.

805
00:46:24,806 --> 00:46:27,473
Called Xero-Lube. It's
like artificial saliva?

806
00:46:27,475 --> 00:46:29,141
That's right. That's right, David.
Really?

807
00:46:29,143 --> 00:46:31,776
Except it's better because
it actually lubricates.

808
00:46:31,778 --> 00:46:34,078
You don't get that, like...

809
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:35,946
I see. That clicky sound.

810
00:46:35,948 --> 00:46:38,148
Could you do that for<i> Rolling Stone?
</i> Here you go.

811
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:41,050
I'll have to remember that.

812
00:46:41,052 --> 00:46:43,886
It's all right. Next tour,
I'll bring myself a case.

813
00:46:43,888 --> 00:46:46,288
In the meantime,
what can I get you?

814
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:47,989
Just water with no ice, please.

815
00:46:47,991 --> 00:46:51,726
Are you a fiction wri... This
is off the record. Oh, good.

816
00:46:51,728 --> 00:46:54,061
Are you a fiction writer?
I'm a poet actually.

817
00:46:54,063 --> 00:46:57,230
Really? Could I have
seen anything of yours?

818
00:46:57,232 --> 00:46:59,665
I just had my first poem
published in<i> The Kenyon Review.</i>

819
00:46:59,667 --> 00:47:03,368
Really? Wow. Congratulations.
Yes. Thank you.

820
00:47:07,705 --> 00:47:09,972
I'm sorry. I don't mean
to be a prima donna,

821
00:47:09,974 --> 00:47:12,341
but do you mind if we
don't do a Q and A?

822
00:47:12,343 --> 00:47:15,410
Yeah, of course. Whatever makes
you feel most comfortable.

823
00:47:15,412 --> 00:47:16,944
Thank you. Sure.

824
00:47:16,946 --> 00:47:20,113
It's always questions like,
"Where do you get your ideas?"

825
00:47:20,115 --> 00:47:23,915
I don't know. From a Time-Life
subscription series for 17.95 a month.

826
00:47:23,917 --> 00:47:26,817
Okay. Now, it's show time. Okay.

827
00:47:28,286 --> 00:47:30,153
Here we go. Yeah.

828
00:47:30,155 --> 00:47:32,455
It's all downhill from here.
It's fine.

829
00:47:32,457 --> 00:47:35,991
This is the very last stop
on his book tour,

830
00:47:35,993 --> 00:47:38,259
and we're very lucky to get him.

831
00:47:38,261 --> 00:47:41,195
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to The Hungry Mind,

832
00:47:41,197 --> 00:47:43,130
David Foster Wallace.

833
00:47:51,639 --> 00:47:54,741
Hello. Hi. Hi.

834
00:47:54,743 --> 00:47:56,709
No, I never show
my mother anything.

835
00:47:56,711 --> 00:47:58,510
Now I feel embarrassed
that I said that.

836
00:47:58,512 --> 00:48:00,578
But that's very sweet.
It is, right?

837
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:02,613
What's that supposed
to be, a computer?

838
00:48:02,615 --> 00:48:05,782
No, that's a smiley face.
Oh. Right.

839
00:48:05,784 --> 00:48:07,517
I could put white-out
on it if you want.

840
00:48:07,519 --> 00:48:10,252
That's okay. It's your book.
Okay.

841
00:48:11,687 --> 00:48:14,789
Oh, man. This old thing.
Do you mind?

842
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:17,258
I don't mind, but the
new one's a lot better.

843
00:48:18,093 --> 00:48:19,226
Awesome.

844
00:48:19,228 --> 00:48:22,628
I just realized that they...
They want me to be good.

845
00:48:23,429 --> 00:48:25,229
You know what I mean?

846
00:48:25,231 --> 00:48:28,198
It's just something about,
like, giving back.

847
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,832
You know, in that way.

848
00:48:29,834 --> 00:48:32,634
That made me feel kind of
better about everything.

849
00:48:32,636 --> 00:48:35,470
Please, give us the... It's
not... There's no story.

850
00:48:35,472 --> 00:48:38,506
How did it happen then? Okay.

851
00:48:38,508 --> 00:48:40,140
I couldn't be regular
old Dave Wallace...

852
00:48:40,142 --> 00:48:42,242
'cause there were Dave
Wallaces all over the place.

853
00:48:42,244 --> 00:48:45,578
And David Rains Wallace wrote for the<i> New
Yorker.</i> I don't know if you remember.

854
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:47,947
So then, one day... It
was Fred Hill asked me,

855
00:48:47,949 --> 00:48:51,383
"What's your middle name?" Dave
Foster Wallace. That's it.

856
00:48:51,385 --> 00:48:53,251
That's your story? Yes.

857
00:48:53,253 --> 00:48:55,786
That is literally the worst superhero
origin story I've ever heard.

858
00:48:55,788 --> 00:48:58,421
I cannot claim that it
was an origin story.

859
00:48:58,423 --> 00:49:02,057
Dave, remember in Tucson that professor
you kind of locked horns with?

860
00:49:02,059 --> 00:49:05,293
Oh, man. My nemesis, who shall
remain nameless. Oh, come on.

861
00:49:05,295 --> 00:49:09,263
I was just kind of a prick. I think
he was too. I was unteachable.

862
00:49:09,265 --> 00:49:12,266
I don't think I was actively
unpleasant in class.

863
00:49:12,268 --> 00:49:14,334
You were pretty unpleasant.

864
00:49:14,336 --> 00:49:15,868
Okay, Betsy. Betsy. Really.

865
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:17,903
Oh, I loved it. I loved it.

866
00:49:17,905 --> 00:49:20,839
Betsy, this is... She loved it.

867
00:49:20,841 --> 00:49:22,807
He was pleasantly unpleasant.

868
00:49:22,809 --> 00:49:25,442
That's a great quote, if you
want to quote something.

869
00:49:25,444 --> 00:49:27,610
I'm gonna have to interview
the teacher as well though.

870
00:49:27,612 --> 00:49:30,579
Hmm.

871
00:49:30,581 --> 00:49:33,748
I have to be up unconscionably early
for this public radio interview,

872
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:34,882
so we should probably get going.

873
00:49:34,884 --> 00:49:36,650
That means I have
to get up early too.

874
00:49:36,652 --> 00:49:39,919
You can do whatever the fuck you want.
You know?

875
00:49:39,921 --> 00:49:42,554
You can sleep in if you want to.

876
00:49:42,556 --> 00:49:45,790
Well, we'll get you back
to the hotel then.

877
00:49:45,792 --> 00:49:47,591
Check. You know what,
I will get the check.

878
00:49:47,593 --> 00:49:50,660
I'll get it. Please,
this one is on me.

879
00:49:50,662 --> 00:49:52,828
Well, it's on Jann.
No, no. It's on me.

880
00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:54,563
Jann? Jann's his boss.

881
00:49:54,565 --> 00:49:57,332
No, this one is on me. It was
just so nice to meet you guys.

882
00:49:57,334 --> 00:49:59,167
Mr.<i> Rolling Stone.</i> Yeah.

883
00:50:23,655 --> 00:50:25,421
Can you close the window?
It's fucking freezing.

884
00:50:25,423 --> 00:50:29,791
No, sorry, I cannot. This is our
hypothermia smoking tour of the Midwest.

885
00:50:29,793 --> 00:50:33,361
Hypothermia smoking tour.
I love that.

886
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:36,230
- Oh, thank you.
- Sounds like something Dave would say.

887
00:50:36,232 --> 00:50:37,764
Doesn't it?

888
00:50:49,574 --> 00:50:51,941
Thanks, ladies. Yeah, sure.

889
00:50:51,943 --> 00:50:54,677
Yeah, thank you so much. Sure.
What are you doing tomorrow?

890
00:50:54,679 --> 00:50:57,679
Oh. I'm not sure yet.

891
00:50:58,747 --> 00:51:00,748
Well, give us a call if you want.
We're here.

892
00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:02,182
Okay. Will do.

893
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:04,184
Thanks again for coming.
Thank you so much.

894
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:05,952
Nice to meet you, Julie.

895
00:51:05,954 --> 00:51:08,120
Bye, Betsy. Bye. Bye, David.

896
00:51:16,828 --> 00:51:19,996
That was fun. Yeah, it was nice.

897
00:51:19,998 --> 00:51:21,897
All right, I'm hungry. Still?

898
00:51:23,366 --> 00:51:25,800
Yeah, it's terrifying
when it's happening.

899
00:51:25,802 --> 00:51:28,569
Really? How does it feel though?

900
00:51:28,571 --> 00:51:31,871
People fighting to get in. A big line
of people wanting to impress you.

901
00:51:33,406 --> 00:51:35,673
I tell you what. I think
that having an audience...

902
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:37,608
Like, really,
really pretty girls...

903
00:51:37,610 --> 00:51:41,445
Who are all paying attention to you
and kind of like what you're saying,

904
00:51:41,447 --> 00:51:46,616
that's gratifying on a fairly, I
think, just simple mammal level.

905
00:51:46,618 --> 00:51:49,485
I know. Why is that?

906
00:51:49,487 --> 00:51:52,788
I think pretty girls are what we most
dream and despair of ever having,

907
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:55,123
like, pay attention to us.

908
00:51:55,125 --> 00:51:58,926
There they are in the front
row making eyes at you.

909
00:51:58,928 --> 00:52:01,361
I think my girlfriend
is in love with you.

910
00:52:02,996 --> 00:52:05,297
Come on. No, she's not.
No, really.

911
00:52:05,299 --> 00:52:06,798
I think she is.

912
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:10,268
I think she likes your writing better
than mine. That's kind of annoying.

913
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:14,304
Let's get her on the phone.
Get her on the phone. What?

914
00:52:14,306 --> 00:52:15,872
No.

915
00:52:17,374 --> 00:52:20,075
No. I don't know. She's...

916
00:52:20,077 --> 00:52:22,710
She's probably sleeping anyway.

917
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:26,346
Please.

918
00:52:28,183 --> 00:52:29,882
<i>Hello?</i> Hi.

919
00:52:29,884 --> 00:52:33,118
<i>How's it going?</i> It's,
uh... Did I wake you up?

920
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:36,020
<i>No. I'm up reading</i>
Infinite Jest.

921
00:52:36,022 --> 00:52:38,322
<i>Pretty amazing.</i> Oh. Good.

922
00:52:38,324 --> 00:52:40,891
Listen, I'm here with somebody
who wants to talk to you.

923
00:52:40,893 --> 00:52:43,627
Can you hold on a second?
What's her name again?

924
00:52:43,629 --> 00:52:45,428
It's Sarah. Yeah. Sarah.

925
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:48,830
Sarah, hi. It's Dave Wallace.

926
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:50,131
<i>Nice to meet you telephonically.</i>

927
00:52:50,133 --> 00:52:52,032
It's nice to meet you
telephonically as well.

928
00:52:52,034 --> 00:52:55,668
<i>Is David behaving himself?</i>
Let me ask him.

929
00:52:55,670 --> 00:52:57,770
Are you behaving yourself?

930
00:52:57,772 --> 00:52:59,772
She's asking that?

931
00:53:01,876 --> 00:53:04,042
I'm reasonably sure that he is.

932
00:53:04,044 --> 00:53:06,344
I don't have eyes on him 24-7.

933
00:53:06,346 --> 00:53:07,978
Sarah? Okay.

934
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:10,046
What are you doin' tonight?
Don't ask her that.

935
00:53:10,048 --> 00:53:14,082
Oh, wow. You're kidding me. Oh, my gosh.
<i>Yes. It's awesome.</i>

936
00:53:14,084 --> 00:53:15,850
What part are you on?

937
00:53:15,852 --> 00:53:18,752
<i>369.</i> Wow, you're
really far along.

938
00:53:18,754 --> 00:53:21,020
<i>I know. I can't put it down.
</i> Oh, thank you.

939
00:53:21,022 --> 00:53:25,824
<i>Really, thank</i> you. I mean,
that's very flattering.

940
00:53:25,826 --> 00:53:28,026
What the fuck was that about?
<i>What?</i>

941
00:53:28,028 --> 00:53:29,761
You were on the phone with him
for half an hour.

942
00:53:29,763 --> 00:53:33,297
<i>It wasn't a half hour.</i> It was. It
was 25 minutes. Okay? I timed it.

943
00:53:33,299 --> 00:53:35,165
You were only supposed
to say hello.

944
00:53:52,182 --> 00:53:55,717
- David?
- David, we gotta go.

945
00:53:55,719 --> 00:53:58,219
Uh, the escort's waiting.

946
00:54:00,288 --> 00:54:02,622
Hey. Sorry.

947
00:54:02,624 --> 00:54:06,726
I got totally, like, sucked
in with this orgy of crap.

948
00:54:06,728 --> 00:54:10,896
There's a simultaneous broadcast of<i> Falcon
Crest, Magnum P.I.</i> and<i> Charlie's Angels.</i>

949
00:54:10,898 --> 00:54:13,031
Okay. A perfect storm of shit.

950
00:54:13,033 --> 00:54:15,099
I'll be out in a second, okay?
Okay.

951
00:54:29,045 --> 00:54:32,047
<i>[ INFOMERCIAL ]</i>

952
00:54:38,019 --> 00:54:40,587
<i>Call now to order and get
this free workout video...</i>

953
00:54:40,589 --> 00:54:43,890

00:54:43,892 --> 00:54:47,526
<i>Plus my 20-minute aerobic workout.

955
00:54:49,128 --> 00:54:50,728
Here, go in. Can you go around?

956
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:52,262
Yeah, yeah. Sure. Thanks.

957
00:54:57,768 --> 00:55:00,001
You're wearing that?

958
00:55:02,537 --> 00:55:05,872
For a radio interview? Uh, yes.

959
00:55:12,779 --> 00:55:15,980
Hi. Dave. Dave Wallace.

960
00:55:15,982 --> 00:55:18,782
I know who you are.

961
00:55:18,784 --> 00:55:21,251
My amanuensis... Mr. Boswell.

962
00:55:21,253 --> 00:55:23,519
- Mr. Boswell.
- Very clever. Hi.

963
00:55:23,521 --> 00:55:25,120
Right this way.

964
00:55:28,390 --> 00:55:31,325
We record digitally.
I hope that's okay.

965
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:34,828
So just yes or no answers?

966
00:55:34,830 --> 00:55:36,229
That's very funny. Hey.

967
00:55:36,231 --> 00:55:39,098
What? Hey. You do a really
mean job with this,

968
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:41,433
Yeah? I got, like, 20
years to get you back.

969
00:55:41,435 --> 00:55:42,834
You remember that.
You're gonna be fine.

970
00:55:42,836 --> 00:55:45,403
My guest today
is David Foster Wallace,

971
00:55:45,405 --> 00:55:48,038
who has burst on
the literary scene...

972
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:51,107
with his 1,079-page,

973
00:55:51,109 --> 00:55:54,709
three-pound, three-ounce novel,

974
00:55:54,711 --> 00:55:56,877
<i>Infinite Jest.</i>

975
00:55:56,879 --> 00:56:00,880
Jay McInerney called it "something
like a sleek Vonnegut chassis..."

976
00:56:00,882 --> 00:56:03,381
wrapped in layers
of post-millennial Zola."

977
00:56:04,850 --> 00:56:06,817
David Foster Wallace,
welcome to our show.

978
00:56:06,819 --> 00:56:08,752
Thank you. I'm glad to be here.

979
00:56:08,754 --> 00:56:13,322
All right. Now, you have said
you saw yourself as, quote,

980
00:56:13,324 --> 00:56:17,859
"a combination of being incredibly
shy and being an egomaniac too."

981
00:56:17,861 --> 00:56:20,828
I believe I said
"exhibitionist" also.

982
00:56:20,830 --> 00:56:22,596
Meaning?

983
00:56:22,598 --> 00:56:24,898
I think being shy basically
means being self-absorbed...

984
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:28,501
to the extent that it makes it
difficult to be around other people.

985
00:56:28,503 --> 00:56:30,503
Difficult for you or difficult
for the other people?

986
00:56:30,505 --> 00:56:34,073
Ah. I suppose
a little bit of both.

987
00:56:34,075 --> 00:56:36,508
That was wonderful. Oh, yeah?

988
00:56:36,510 --> 00:56:40,811
I listened to the whole show.
It was so interesting. Thanks.

989
00:56:40,813 --> 00:56:43,180
I may have to buy your
book and read it.

990
00:56:43,182 --> 00:56:45,382
- Uh, sorry about that.
- Oh, no!

991
00:56:45,384 --> 00:56:48,118
Wasn't he wonderful?
He was wonderful.

992
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:51,054
Oh, my gosh. So, you have
the rest of the day free.

993
00:56:51,056 --> 00:56:53,289
Where would you like to go?

994
00:56:53,291 --> 00:56:54,890
Yeah.

995
00:56:54,892 --> 00:56:57,158
Do you know where
the Mall of America is?

996
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:59,393
Yes, I do. Great.

997
00:56:59,395 --> 00:57:01,495
Yes, I do. Yeah.

998
00:57:08,403 --> 00:57:11,337
I wanted to write something
that had the sort of texture...

999
00:57:11,339 --> 00:57:13,272
of what American life
is like now.

1000
00:57:13,274 --> 00:57:15,641
- This tsunami of stuff just comin' at you.
- Right.

1001
00:57:15,643 --> 00:57:18,877
Also, it's not unfun, I don't think.
No. I don't think so either.

1002
00:57:18,879 --> 00:57:22,080
No. Not at all. I mean, although it
is, uh... it is sort of heavy though.

1003
00:57:22,082 --> 00:57:24,248
Right? Weight-wise at least.

1004
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:27,351
My friend said, when it hit his porch,
it sounded like a car bomb going off.

1005
00:57:27,353 --> 00:57:30,220
Right. Exactly. And... And who
do you think your readers are?

1006
00:57:30,222 --> 00:57:32,155
Are they, uh...
Are they college kids?

1007
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:35,224
The people who seem most
enthusiastic are young men.

1008
00:57:35,226 --> 00:57:37,993
Which I guess I understand.
It's a fairly male book.

1009
00:57:37,995 --> 00:57:41,162
It's a fairly nerdy book, too,
about loneliness.

1010
00:57:41,164 --> 00:57:44,031
You also can expect that someone who's
willing to read... and read hard...

1011
00:57:44,033 --> 00:57:47,100
A thousand-page book is gonna be
someone with some loneliness issues.

1012
00:57:47,102 --> 00:57:49,469
Right.

1013
00:57:50,737 --> 00:57:53,171
So, is that what you think
the book is about then?

1014
00:57:53,173 --> 00:57:55,306
About loneliness?

1015
00:57:58,410 --> 00:58:01,745
I think that if there's a sort
of sadness for people under 45,

1016
00:58:01,747 --> 00:58:06,049
it has something to do with pleasure
and achievement and entertainment.

1017
00:58:06,051 --> 00:58:09,252
Like a sort of emptiness at the heart
of what they thought was going on,

1018
00:58:09,254 --> 00:58:12,288
and maybe I can hope
that some parts of the book...

1019
00:58:12,290 --> 00:58:14,923
speak to their nerve endings
a little bit. Mm-hmm.

1020
00:58:14,925 --> 00:58:18,293
If you quote any of this, by the way,
you'd do me a great favor by saying...

1021
00:58:18,295 --> 00:58:20,061
this is what I hope
for the book, you know.

1022
00:58:20,063 --> 00:58:22,963
This is what the book is trying to achieve.
I don't pretend that it has.

1023
00:58:22,965 --> 00:58:25,865
That's... That's fine. Um...

1024
00:58:25,867 --> 00:58:28,934
So the Walter Kirn review in, uh,
<i>New York</i> magazine. Did you...

1025
00:58:28,936 --> 00:58:32,137
I heard about it. I didn't read it.
You didn't read it.

1026
00:58:32,139 --> 00:58:35,840
"Next year's book awards have been
decided." How do you feel about that?

1027
00:58:35,842 --> 00:58:38,843
How do I feel about it? I applaud
his taste and discernment.

1028
00:58:38,845 --> 00:58:41,478
What do you want me to say?
How would you feel about it?

1029
00:58:42,546 --> 00:58:45,047
How would I feel?

1030
00:58:45,049 --> 00:58:51,586
That something that I had known was really
good was now being validated by somebody else.

1031
00:58:51,588 --> 00:58:56,490
All I know is this is absolutely the
best I could do between 1992 and 1995.

1032
00:58:56,492 --> 00:58:58,625
If everybody had hated it,
I wouldn't have been thrilled.

1033
00:58:58,627 --> 00:59:02,128
I don't think I would have
been devastated either.

1034
00:59:02,130 --> 00:59:05,264
When you're used to doing heavy-duty
literary stuff that doesn't sell well,

1035
00:59:05,266 --> 00:59:09,467
being human animals with egos, you accommodate
that fact by the following equation.

1036
00:59:09,469 --> 00:59:12,303
If something sells really well,
gets a lot of attention,

1037
00:59:12,305 --> 00:59:14,505
it's gotta be shit, right?
Right. Of course.

1038
00:59:14,507 --> 00:59:16,773
The ultimate irony is, if your
thing starts selling well,

1039
00:59:16,775 --> 00:59:18,307
gets a lot of attention,

1040
00:59:18,309 --> 00:59:20,309
the very mechanism
you used to shore yourself up...

1041
00:59:20,311 --> 00:59:22,177
when your thing didn't sell
well... Doesn't work anymore.

1042
00:59:22,179 --> 00:59:25,680
It's now part of the darkness nexus when
it does, so you're totally screwed.

1043
00:59:25,682 --> 00:59:27,415
You know, you can't win.

1044
00:59:29,718 --> 00:59:31,919
I don't really see how they
could've gotten lost. Right.

1045
00:59:31,921 --> 00:59:35,923
I mean, it's a straight shot. Yeah. Of
course. Right, just past the food court.

1046
00:59:35,925 --> 00:59:39,326
Yeah. Through the amusement park.
Through the first lobster.

1047
00:59:39,328 --> 00:59:41,728
Yeah. Don't go to the aquarium.
Turn right.

1048
00:59:41,730 --> 00:59:45,130
Do not... If you see fudge,
you've gone too far.

1049
00:59:45,132 --> 00:59:47,866
Hey! Hello.

1050
00:59:47,868 --> 00:59:49,500
Aw. Hey!

1051
00:59:51,736 --> 00:59:54,404
- Hello.
- It's good to see you.

1052
00:59:54,406 --> 00:59:56,172
Nice to see you. Thanks
for driving up here.

1053
00:59:56,174 --> 00:59:57,506
Yes. You love it, I know it.

1054
00:59:57,508 --> 00:59:59,508
Nice to see you. Hello, Betsy.
Great. How are you?

1055
00:59:59,510 --> 01:00:01,776
What's<i> The Juror?</i>

1056
01:00:01,778 --> 01:00:05,712
Oh, that's a Demi Moore,
John Grisham movie. Yeah.

1057
01:00:05,714 --> 01:00:07,013
<i>Happy Gilmore?</i> No.

1058
01:00:07,015 --> 01:00:08,681
That's, uh, what? Adam Sandler.

1059
01:00:08,683 --> 01:00:10,849
Right. What about,
uh, <i>Broken Arrow?</i>

1060
01:00:10,851 --> 01:00:14,252
It's a dumb boy movie. Stuff blows up.
I've actually seen that.

1061
01:00:14,254 --> 01:00:15,786
You saw that already?
I did actually.

1062
01:00:15,788 --> 01:00:17,320
Wow, a man after my own heart.

1063
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:19,889
But I would be happy to see
it again if you want to.

1064
01:00:19,891 --> 01:00:21,690
Nah. We can really see anything.

1065
01:00:34,468 --> 01:00:36,702
Oh, man.

1066
01:00:57,022 --> 01:00:58,689
No.

1067
01:01:00,191 --> 01:01:01,257
Yes.

1068
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:11,866
It's fantastic.

1069
01:01:11,868 --> 01:01:14,235
- Horrible.
- You have got to be kidding me.

1070
01:01:14,237 --> 01:01:17,738
That was the worst... The end, when
Travolta got impaled by the thing?

1071
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:20,941
The worst movie I've ever seen.
He-He saved humanity, Betsy.

1072
01:01:20,943 --> 01:01:22,676
No, he did not. Have a heart.

1073
01:01:22,678 --> 01:01:24,310
He made it worse.
You've changed.

1074
01:01:24,312 --> 01:01:26,512
He made it worse.
What do we do now?

1075
01:01:26,514 --> 01:01:30,015
Do you have a TV? Uh-huh. I do.

1076
01:01:30,017 --> 01:01:32,650
<i>Oh, God. You know what I mean.
Who knows? Okay.</i>

1077
01:01:32,652 --> 01:01:34,918
<i>I guess, you know. Oh, gotta hand
you, that show the other day.</i>

1078
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:36,786
<i>With Sandra Bernhard?
Ah, Jesus Christ!</i>

1079
01:01:36,788 --> 01:01:38,487
I know that guy actually.

1080
01:01:38,489 --> 01:01:41,156
Wh-Which one? The one
playing Letterman.

1081
01:01:41,158 --> 01:01:42,557
Really? You do?

1082
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:44,592
How? We went to
Amherst together.

1083
01:01:44,594 --> 01:01:45,526
No. Yeah.

1084
01:01:45,528 --> 01:01:47,060
Was he a friend of yours?

1085
01:01:47,062 --> 01:01:48,761
I hated his guts so much.

1086
01:01:48,763 --> 01:01:50,262
Of course you did. Right.

1087
01:01:50,264 --> 01:01:52,330
Hey, wait. Does anyone
want drinks or anything?

1088
01:01:52,332 --> 01:01:54,065
No. No? Okay.

1089
01:01:54,067 --> 01:01:57,835
- But, um, there's also beer in the fridge.
- Soda's fine. Thank you.

1090
01:01:59,170 --> 01:02:02,238
- Why did you hate him?
- Pretty simple recipe.

1091
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:04,506
He was, like, very cool and popular.
Mm-hmm.

1092
01:02:04,508 --> 01:02:08,409
And I was not. That was the basic offense.
Look at him now.

1093
01:02:11,746 --> 01:02:13,513
Hey. Hey.

1094
01:02:13,515 --> 01:02:15,414
Ah, I brought you something.

1095
01:02:15,416 --> 01:02:17,048
You brought me something?

1096
01:02:17,050 --> 01:02:18,616
Yeah. What is this?

1097
01:02:18,618 --> 01:02:20,551
Oh, my God. This is the, uh...

1098
01:02:20,553 --> 01:02:22,486
This is the<i> Review,</i> where
you have your poem in it.

1099
01:02:22,488 --> 01:02:23,820
Somewhere in there.
That's amazing.

1100
01:02:24,354 --> 01:02:25,754
What's on next?

1101
01:02:25,756 --> 01:02:29,724
<i>Algiers,</i> starring Hedy Lamarr.
Have you seen that?

1102
01:02:29,726 --> 01:02:33,861
Um, no. It's one of the greats.
And Hedy Lamarr is fascinating.

1103
01:02:33,863 --> 01:02:36,697
She invented, uh... She
invented frequency hopping.

1104
01:02:37,365 --> 01:02:38,932
No, she didn't. Yeah.

1105
01:02:38,934 --> 01:02:40,533
I will. I definitely will.

1106
01:02:40,535 --> 01:02:41,800
Um...

1107
01:02:41,802 --> 01:02:43,935
Hey, I was wondering.
When I get back to New York,

1108
01:02:43,937 --> 01:02:46,837
if I have any questions about what Dave
was like in grad school or something,

1109
01:02:46,839 --> 01:02:50,407
can I e-mail you?
Sure, if it's okay with Dave.

1110
01:02:50,409 --> 01:02:52,041
I'm sure it's fine with Dave.

1111
01:02:52,043 --> 01:02:55,778
That's great. So can I take your
e-mail address then? Sure. Uh, yeah.

1112
01:02:56,646 --> 01:02:58,680
Oh, that'd be great. Thank you.

1113
01:02:58,682 --> 01:03:02,617
You could just write it
on your book.

1114
01:03:08,423 --> 01:03:10,090
Thank you so much.
Can you read that?

1115
01:03:10,092 --> 01:03:14,193
I can see that it is letters. But,
no, I'll be fine. Thank you so much.

1116
01:03:14,195 --> 01:03:15,794
Sure.

1117
01:03:19,998 --> 01:03:22,032
- So, do you drink out of the tap?
- Yes.

1118
01:03:22,034 --> 01:03:23,800
Okay, great.

1119
01:03:28,104 --> 01:03:30,071
What are you...
What are you doing?

1120
01:03:30,073 --> 01:03:31,539
What?

1121
01:03:31,541 --> 01:03:34,875
I saw you hitting on Betsy.

1122
01:03:34,877 --> 01:03:38,979
Hitting on... I was...
I was talking to her.

1123
01:03:38,981 --> 01:03:42,115
David. I saw you.

1124
01:03:42,117 --> 01:03:44,851
You got her to give you
her address.

1125
01:03:44,853 --> 01:03:48,120
No, no, no. I got her to
give me her e-mail address.

1126
01:03:48,122 --> 01:03:51,189
In case I had questions about the
piece that I am writing about you.

1127
01:03:51,191 --> 01:03:52,690
Really? Okay. Yeah, really.

1128
01:03:52,692 --> 01:03:55,492
Well, I'll tell you what. What?

1129
01:03:55,494 --> 01:03:57,060
I don't want her talking to you.

1130
01:03:57,062 --> 01:03:58,728
- I won't contact her.
- Look...

1131
01:03:58,730 --> 01:04:01,697
I told you that Betsy and I
dated during grad school.

1132
01:04:01,699 --> 01:04:04,665
The least... Look at me. The least
you could... No, you're not.

1133
01:04:06,768 --> 01:04:09,002
The least you could do
is show me the respect...

1134
01:04:09,004 --> 01:04:12,338
of not coming on to her
right in front of me.

1135
01:04:12,340 --> 01:04:17,342
Dave, I'm sorry if it looked that way.
That was not my intention.

1136
01:04:17,344 --> 01:04:20,878
And why would I want to get involved
with somebody who lives in Saint Paul?

1137
01:04:22,547 --> 01:04:26,916
I don't know. You're already involved
with somebody who lives in Los Angeles.

1138
01:04:29,052 --> 01:04:30,252
Okay.

1139
01:04:30,254 --> 01:04:32,354
Are you okay?

1140
01:04:32,356 --> 01:04:34,322
Yeah, everything's fine.
Thank you.

1141
01:04:34,324 --> 01:04:35,990
Okay.

1142
01:04:36,992 --> 01:04:39,492
Stay away from her, okay?

1143
01:04:41,728 --> 01:04:44,062
Be a good guy.

1144
01:04:48,967 --> 01:04:50,767
What'd I miss?

1145
01:04:50,769 --> 01:04:55,070
Everything. Nothing. Everything? That
seems like a gross exaggeration.

1146
01:05:15,055 --> 01:05:18,757
<i>No. No! No!</i>

1147
01:05:18,759 --> 01:05:22,526
<i>No! No! No!</i>

1148
01:05:23,628 --> 01:05:25,195
<i>No!</i>

1149
01:05:56,458 --> 01:05:58,959
9.50, please.

1150
01:05:58,961 --> 01:06:02,629
I got it. It's all right. My
expense account will pay for it.

1151
01:06:02,631 --> 01:06:05,498
Yeah, so will mine.
I said I got it.

1152
01:06:07,701 --> 01:06:09,435
Thank you.

1153
01:06:49,037 --> 01:06:51,104
Hey, um...

1154
01:06:52,272 --> 01:06:54,239
Good night.

1155
01:07:00,713 --> 01:07:02,547
<i>Were you flirting?</i> Sarah. Of
course I was not flirting.

1156
01:07:02,549 --> 01:07:04,382
He just... He went
completely crazy on me.

1157
01:07:04,384 --> 01:07:07,151
<i>Well, you do that, David, you know?
You're not even aware of it.</i>

1158
01:07:07,153 --> 01:07:09,987
Sorry, I do... What do I do?
<i>You're compulsively flirtatious.</i>

1159
01:07:09,989 --> 01:07:11,822
Okay. Well, now you're
taking his side.

1160
01:07:11,824 --> 01:07:15,392
<i>I am not.</i> Yes, you are.
Listen, I...

1161
01:07:15,394 --> 01:07:18,027
I think I'm just
really tired, okay?

1162
01:07:19,262 --> 01:07:21,129
I gotta go.

1163
01:07:21,131 --> 01:07:22,597
<i>David?</i>

1164
01:07:23,632 --> 01:07:25,633
<i>David?</i>

1165
01:07:35,810 --> 01:07:37,143
Good morning!

1166
01:07:37,145 --> 01:07:39,778
Hi. And how are we this morning?

1167
01:07:42,214 --> 01:07:43,847
Think I'll sit up front.

1168
01:07:43,849 --> 01:07:48,150
Oh. Okay. Let me just,
um, move my stuff.

1169
01:07:49,852 --> 01:07:51,652
There you go.

1170
01:09:43,124 --> 01:09:45,291
Okay.

1171
01:09:47,861 --> 01:09:50,028
What?

1172
01:09:50,030 --> 01:09:52,630
You didn't think to write
down where we parked the car?

1173
01:09:52,632 --> 01:09:55,032
No. I didn't. Okay?

1174
01:09:55,034 --> 01:09:57,567
Sorry. I fucked up. All right?
I'm a fuckup.

1175
01:09:57,569 --> 01:09:59,936
Not everybody can be
as brilliant as you.

1176
01:09:59,938 --> 01:10:02,905
What is with you? What
the fuck is with you?

1177
01:10:17,050 --> 01:10:19,651
I gotta say,
there's something...

1178
01:10:19,653 --> 01:10:22,686
basically false about
your approach here.

1179
01:10:24,021 --> 01:10:26,789
What do you mean "false"?
Yeah, I think it's, uh...

1180
01:10:26,791 --> 01:10:30,358
I think it's part of your
whole social strategy.

1181
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:32,960
In what way?

1182
01:10:32,962 --> 01:10:36,396
You still feel you're
smarter than other people.

1183
01:10:36,398 --> 01:10:37,964
Oh, really? Yeah, yeah.

1184
01:10:37,966 --> 01:10:40,199
But you act like you're
in a kids' softball game,

1185
01:10:40,201 --> 01:10:42,634
but holding back his power-hitting to
try and make it more competitive...

1186
01:10:42,636 --> 01:10:44,135
for the little ones, you know?

1187
01:10:44,137 --> 01:10:47,471
When? Here. Now. The
past three days.

1188
01:10:47,473 --> 01:10:49,840
It's part of your
social strategy.

1189
01:10:51,309 --> 01:10:53,677
You're a tough room, you know that?
It's so obvious,

1190
01:10:53,679 --> 01:10:57,713
the way you hold back your intelligence
to be with people who are, uh,

1191
01:10:57,715 --> 01:10:59,781
younger than you
or not as agile as you.

1192
01:10:59,783 --> 01:11:01,949
That would make me a real
asshole, wouldn't it? Well.

1193
01:11:03,418 --> 01:11:06,186
I don't think writers
are smarter than other people.

1194
01:11:06,188 --> 01:11:09,289
I think they may be more
compelling in their stupidity.

1195
01:11:09,291 --> 01:11:10,957
Or in their confusion.

1196
01:11:10,959 --> 01:11:13,225
But I think one of the real ways
I have gotten smarter...

1197
01:11:13,227 --> 01:11:15,460
is I don't think I'm that much
smarter than other people.

1198
01:11:15,462 --> 01:11:17,028
That's right.

1199
01:11:17,030 --> 01:11:19,563
There are ways in which other
people are a lot smarter than me.

1200
01:11:19,565 --> 01:11:22,232
And I gotta tell you, it...

1201
01:11:22,234 --> 01:11:24,434
It makes me feel kinda lonely.
What?

1202
01:11:24,436 --> 01:11:27,336
There's been certain stuff I've
told you that's been really true.

1203
01:11:27,338 --> 01:11:29,738
- I think it's been brave of me.
- No, no, no. Absolutely.

1204
01:11:29,740 --> 01:11:31,606
I've written enough
of these pieces to know...

1205
01:11:31,608 --> 01:11:34,141
you can write this up a hundred
different ways. You're right.

1206
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:37,144
Ninety of which I'm gonna come
across as a monumental asshole.

1207
01:11:37,146 --> 01:11:39,813
And now it seems to me
like your read on this is,

1208
01:11:39,815 --> 01:11:43,082
"Wow. What an interesting
persona Dave is adopting...

1209
01:11:43,084 --> 01:11:45,451
- "for the purposes of this interview."
- No, that's not what I'm saying.

1210
01:11:45,453 --> 01:11:50,121
If we had done this by the mail, if I had access
to my library, if I could look stuff up...

1211
01:11:50,123 --> 01:11:53,023
My dream for this would be for you
to write it up, send it to me...

1212
01:11:53,025 --> 01:11:54,491
- and let me rewrite all my quotes.
- Right.

1213
01:11:54,493 --> 01:11:56,926
Which, of course, you'll never do.
But if I'm in a room...

1214
01:11:56,928 --> 01:12:00,095
by myself, alone, and I have
time, I can be really smart.

1215
01:12:00,097 --> 01:12:03,831
Yes, I think I'm bright. I think I'm talented.
I'm not trying to sound disingenuous...

1216
01:12:03,833 --> 01:12:05,999
- Oh, no?
- I am not an idiot.

1217
01:12:06,001 --> 01:12:08,801
Yes, I can talk intelligently
with you about stuff,

1218
01:12:08,803 --> 01:12:11,136
but I can't quite
keep up with you.

1219
01:12:11,138 --> 01:12:12,937
- Okay. That is such bullshit.
- Oh, believe me.

1220
01:12:12,939 --> 01:12:16,140
I am not doing some
sorta like, "Aw, shucks."

1221
01:12:16,142 --> 01:12:18,242
I'm just in from the country.
I'm not a real writer.

1222
01:12:18,244 --> 01:12:20,744
"I'm a regular guy" thing. I'm not
trying to lay some shit on you.

1223
01:12:20,746 --> 01:12:24,380
But you did it again though. You flatter
me, but you're just patronizing.

1224
01:12:24,382 --> 01:12:26,315
I just think that to look
across the room...

1225
01:12:26,317 --> 01:12:29,384
and to automatically assume
that somebody is less aware...

1226
01:12:29,386 --> 01:12:33,554
or that their interior life is
somehow less rich and complicated...

1227
01:12:33,556 --> 01:12:37,858
- and acutely perceived as mine, makes me not as good a writer.
- Why?

1228
01:12:37,860 --> 01:12:40,460
Because it means I'm gonna be performing
for some faceless audience...

1229
01:12:40,462 --> 01:12:42,695
instead of trying to have a
conversation with a person.

1230
01:12:42,697 --> 01:12:46,231
If you think that's faux... You know what?
You think whatever you want.

1231
01:12:46,233 --> 01:12:49,767
I got a real, serious fear
of being a certain way.

1232
01:12:49,769 --> 01:12:53,670
And a set, I think, of real convictions
about why I'm continuing to do this.

1233
01:12:53,672 --> 01:12:56,773
Why it's worthwhile. Why it's not just
an exercise in getting my dick sucked.

1234
01:12:56,775 --> 01:12:58,474
Okay.

1235
01:12:58,476 --> 01:13:00,809
- This is such a clever tactic on your part.
- Tactic? What tactic?

1236
01:13:00,811 --> 01:13:03,311
That's right. Get me a little pissed
off, get me a little less guarded...

1237
01:13:03,313 --> 01:13:05,780
I'm gonna reveal more.
Yes, it's true.

1238
01:13:05,782 --> 01:13:08,082
- I treasure my regular guyness.
- Mm-hmm.

1239
01:13:08,084 --> 01:13:10,651
I've come to think that maybe it's
my biggest asset as a writer.

1240
01:13:10,653 --> 01:13:13,052
That I'm basically
just like everybody else.

1241
01:13:15,955 --> 01:13:19,724
You know what? I'm not doing any kind of faux
thing with you. And I'm not gonna say it again.

1242
01:13:19,726 --> 01:13:23,727
Okay. But that faux thing? What you just
said is an example of the faux thing.

1243
01:13:23,729 --> 01:13:26,228
You're not willing to risk
giving the full you.

1244
01:13:28,231 --> 01:13:31,900
I don't know if you're
a very nice man or not.

1245
01:13:31,902 --> 01:13:34,735
It's very clear you don't
believe a word that I've said.

1246
01:13:36,637 --> 01:13:39,805
All your protesting? You
know... I'm just a regular guy?

1247
01:13:41,207 --> 01:13:43,274
You don't crack open
a thousand-page book...

1248
01:13:43,276 --> 01:13:45,542
because you heard the author
is a regular guy.

1249
01:13:45,544 --> 01:13:50,078
You do it because he's brilliant,
because you want him to be brilliant.

1250
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:52,080
So, who the fuck
are you kidding?

1251
01:13:55,484 --> 01:13:58,619
I don't have the brain cells left to
play any kind of faux games with you.

1252
01:13:58,621 --> 01:14:00,020
Mm-hmm. It's fine. Yeah.

1253
01:14:00,022 --> 01:14:01,955
- Yeah, it's fine.

1254
01:15:00,646 --> 01:15:02,413
What are you thinking?

1255
01:15:04,282 --> 01:15:07,484
Tour's over. Yeah.
That just hit you.

1256
01:15:07,486 --> 01:15:10,854
Yeah. I'm gonna have to
kinda feel all of this now,

1257
01:15:10,856 --> 01:15:12,989
instead of just
sleepwalk through it.

1258
01:15:12,991 --> 01:15:15,825
What do you mean sleepwalking?

1259
01:15:17,027 --> 01:15:20,396
I've sort of unplugged myself
the past three weeks.

1260
01:15:20,398 --> 01:15:23,198
Meeting a whole lot of new
people and having to do stuff,

1261
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:26,568
you're in this constant
low-level state of anxiety.

1262
01:15:26,570 --> 01:15:29,570
This deep existential fear you feel
all the way down in your butt hole.

1263
01:15:30,672 --> 01:15:32,539
What are you afraid of? I mean...

1264
01:15:32,541 --> 01:15:35,141
What's the worst
that could possibly happen?

1265
01:15:35,143 --> 01:15:38,611
The worst? That I really get to like it.
That's the worst.

1266
01:15:38,613 --> 01:15:40,312
The attention? Yeah.

1267
01:15:43,716 --> 01:15:45,349
What would be so wrong
with that?

1268
01:15:45,351 --> 01:15:49,119
Become one
of these hideous, like...

1269
01:15:49,121 --> 01:15:52,088
"Yet another publication party.
Hey, there's Dave.

1270
01:15:52,090 --> 01:15:55,057
Stickin' his head
in the back of the photo."

1271
01:15:57,060 --> 01:16:00,896
- Rather be dead.
- Why?

1272
01:16:00,898 --> 01:16:04,999
I don't wanna be seen that way.
Why, would you?

1273
01:16:06,735 --> 01:16:11,004
Well, if you're deriving your satisfaction
from talking about your work...

1274
01:16:11,006 --> 01:16:14,340
instead of actually writing,
then yeah.

1275
01:16:14,342 --> 01:16:16,508
I mean, I guess you'd get
a lot less done.

1276
01:16:16,510 --> 01:16:19,377
Exactly. There's nothing more grotesque
than somebody going around saying,

1277
01:16:19,379 --> 01:16:22,079
"I'm a writer. I'm a writer.
I'm a writer."

1278
01:16:23,347 --> 01:16:25,348
I don't mind appearing
in<i> Rolling Stone.</i>

1279
01:16:25,350 --> 01:16:27,383
I don't want to appear
in<i> Rolling Stone...</i>

1280
01:16:27,385 --> 01:16:30,519
as somebody who wants to be
in<i> Rolling Stone.</i>

1281
01:16:30,521 --> 01:16:34,055
If you see me on a game show in the
next couple of years, I swear to God...

1282
01:16:36,591 --> 01:16:39,192
To have written a book
about how seductive image is,

1283
01:16:39,194 --> 01:16:42,762
how easy it is to get seduced
off of any meaningful path...

1284
01:16:42,764 --> 01:16:44,930
because of the way
our culture is now...

1285
01:16:44,932 --> 01:16:47,598
What if I become a parody
of that very thing?

1286
01:16:49,701 --> 01:16:52,002
You know, tomorrow,
you drive away.

1287
01:16:52,004 --> 01:16:55,472
And you get on a plane,
and this whole thing is over.

1288
01:16:55,474 --> 01:16:59,509
I go back to knowing, like,
20 people.

1289
01:16:59,511 --> 01:17:03,045
I'm gonna have to decompress from all this
attention, because it's like gettin'...

1290
01:17:03,047 --> 01:17:06,114
It's like gettin' heroin
injected into your cortex.

1291
01:17:06,116 --> 01:17:09,283
And where I'm gonna need
real balls, is to...

1292
01:17:10,151 --> 01:17:13,252
sit and go through that.

1293
01:17:14,354 --> 01:17:17,022
And try to remind myself
of what the reality is...

1294
01:17:17,024 --> 01:17:22,160
That I'm 34 years old and I'm alone
in a room with a piece of paper.

1295
01:17:42,347 --> 01:17:44,080
Hey. Here ya go.

1296
01:17:44,082 --> 01:17:47,683
I'll never leave you again.
I swear.

1297
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:53,487
All right. Shit check.

1298
01:17:55,423 --> 01:17:56,856
Look what you did.

1299
01:17:56,858 --> 01:17:58,657
Look what you did.

1300
01:17:58,659 --> 01:18:02,661
A little excremental work. Looks like
we won't need this anymore, huh?

1301
01:18:02,663 --> 01:18:05,430
It's all right. It happens
to the best of us. Huh, boy?

1302
01:18:05,432 --> 01:18:06,998
Never fails.

1303
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:10,735
They wait to do their thing until
after the dog sitter leaves.

1304
01:18:10,737 --> 01:18:13,403
Make sure your<i> Rolling Stone</i>
readers hear about that.

1305
01:18:25,548 --> 01:18:29,317
Hey, so I'm-I'm leaving
tomorrow and, uh...

1306
01:18:31,286 --> 01:18:35,355
I gotta ask you
about this rumor.

1307
01:18:35,357 --> 01:18:37,190
Is this the heroin thing? Yeah.

1308
01:18:37,192 --> 01:18:39,292
This is the heroin thing again?
Yeah.

1309
01:18:39,294 --> 01:18:42,528
It isn't true. What is so
hard for you to believe?

1310
01:18:42,530 --> 01:18:45,264
The reason it is so hard to believe
is because there is so much...

1311
01:18:45,266 --> 01:18:47,266
about drugs and
addiction in the book.

1312
01:18:47,268 --> 01:18:48,734
That doesn't mean that
it's autobiographical.

1313
01:18:48,736 --> 01:18:52,537
The book stuff is meant to
be a metaphor. What is...

1314
01:18:52,539 --> 01:18:55,106
You don't believe a fuckin' word
that I've said, do you?

1315
01:18:55,108 --> 01:18:56,974
I didn't say that.

1316
01:18:56,976 --> 01:18:59,910
I was not...
I never was a heroin addict.

1317
01:18:59,912 --> 01:19:04,547
Okay. The rumor I heard was that in the
late '80s, when you were at Harvard,

1318
01:19:04,549 --> 01:19:07,082
you got involved with drugs, and
you had some kind of breakdown.

1319
01:19:07,084 --> 01:19:09,451
I don't know if...

1320
01:19:09,453 --> 01:19:12,520
I don't know if I had a breakdown.
I got very, very depressed.

1321
01:19:12,522 --> 01:19:15,890
I told you that. It had
nothing to do with drugs.

1322
01:19:15,892 --> 01:19:19,426
I have spent most of my life in libraries.
I never lived that dangerous kind of life.

1323
01:19:19,428 --> 01:19:21,227
And I would never stick
a needle into my arm...

1324
01:19:21,229 --> 01:19:23,829
- Okay, so how do you think that rumor got started?
- I have no ide...

1325
01:19:23,831 --> 01:19:25,831
- I have no idea.
- All right. All right. Calm down.

1326
01:19:25,833 --> 01:19:30,635
And I'm telling you, if you were to
structure this as some sort of like,

1327
01:19:30,637 --> 01:19:34,138
"and then he spiraled into
terrible addiction" sort of thing,

1328
01:19:34,140 --> 01:19:36,340
it would be inaccurate.

1329
01:19:36,342 --> 01:19:40,077
It was much more that I got
more and more unhappy.

1330
01:19:40,079 --> 01:19:43,080
The more unhappy I got,
the more I would drink.

1331
01:19:43,082 --> 01:19:48,218
There was no joy in that drinking.
I used it for anesthesia.

1332
01:19:48,220 --> 01:19:50,787
Okay? Okay. What kind
of drinker were you?

1333
01:19:50,789 --> 01:19:53,890
Were you a kind of falling-down drinker?
Were you a "waking up in the curb" drinker?

1334
01:19:53,892 --> 01:19:56,259
No, I was not. Okay? All right.

1335
01:19:56,261 --> 01:19:59,295
A part of my reticence
about this whole thing...

1336
01:19:59,297 --> 01:20:02,665
is that it won't make
very good copy for you.

1337
01:20:02,667 --> 01:20:04,733
Because, no, I was not
like that at all.

1338
01:20:04,735 --> 01:20:07,335
You did agree to this interview.
I know that I did.

1339
01:20:07,337 --> 01:20:09,036
All right. I'm not gonna
push much further. Sorry.

1340
01:20:09,038 --> 01:20:12,773
I am also aware that some
addictions are sexier than others.

1341
01:20:12,775 --> 01:20:16,543
My primary addiction my entire
life has been to television.

1342
01:20:16,545 --> 01:20:19,112
I told you that.
Now television addiction...

1343
01:20:19,114 --> 01:20:24,116
is of far less interest to your
readers than something like heroin...

1344
01:20:24,118 --> 01:20:26,184
that confirms the mythos
of the writer.

1345
01:20:26,186 --> 01:20:27,952
Yeah, a myth I do not believe.
Okay? Right. No.

1346
01:20:27,954 --> 01:20:30,387
I know you don't believe that. I'm
also aware that one of the things...

1347
01:20:30,389 --> 01:20:33,223
that's swirlin' around here is you want to
have the best fuckin' article you can have.

1348
01:20:33,225 --> 01:20:35,858
See, you know what? Why don't you
write whatever the fuck you want.

1349
01:20:35,860 --> 01:20:40,161
I am telling you that this was not
a<i> Lost Weekend</i> sort of thing.

1350
01:20:40,163 --> 01:20:43,097
Nor was it some lurid, romantic,

1351
01:20:43,099 --> 01:20:45,032
"writer as alcoholic"
sort of thing.

1352
01:20:45,034 --> 01:20:47,634
What it was,
was a 28-year-old person...

1353
01:20:47,636 --> 01:20:51,070
who had really exhausted
a couple other ways to live,

1354
01:20:51,072 --> 01:20:53,138
had really taken them
to their conclusion.

1355
01:20:53,140 --> 01:20:57,375
Which for me was a pink room with a
drain in the center of the floor,

1356
01:20:57,377 --> 01:21:01,111
which is where they put me for an entire day
when they thought that I was gonna kill myself.

1357
01:21:02,746 --> 01:21:07,182
Where I got nothin' on. I got someone
observing me through a slot in the wall.

1358
01:21:08,517 --> 01:21:12,486
And when that happens to you,
you become tremendously,

1359
01:21:12,488 --> 01:21:15,622
just unprecedentedly willing...

1360
01:21:15,624 --> 01:21:18,825
to examine some other
alternatives for how to live.

1361
01:22:18,749 --> 01:22:20,349
You awake?

1362
01:22:21,551 --> 01:22:23,785
Yeah.

1363
01:22:24,887 --> 01:22:26,720
I was just thinking, um...

1364
01:22:29,690 --> 01:22:32,658
It wasn't a chemical imbalance,
and it wasn't drugs and alcohol.

1365
01:22:32,660 --> 01:22:34,259
I think, um...

1366
01:22:35,661 --> 01:22:39,864
It was much more that I had lived
an incredibly American life.

1367
01:22:39,866 --> 01:22:46,270
This idea that if I could just achieve X and
Y and Z, that everything would be okay.

1368
01:22:52,109 --> 01:22:57,446
There's a thing in the book about how when
somebody leaps from a burning skyscraper,

1369
01:22:57,448 --> 01:22:59,681
it's not that they're not afraid
of falling anymore.

1370
01:22:59,683 --> 01:23:03,618
It's that the alternative
is so awful.

1371
01:23:03,620 --> 01:23:07,221
And so then you're invited to
consider what could be so awful...

1372
01:23:07,223 --> 01:23:11,524
that leaping to your death would
seem like an escape from it.

1373
01:23:13,193 --> 01:23:16,361
I don't know if you have any
experience with this kind of thing.

1374
01:23:16,363 --> 01:23:18,863
But it's worse than any kind
of physical injury.

1375
01:23:21,566 --> 01:23:24,868
It may be in the old days what was
known as a spiritual crisis...

1376
01:23:28,706 --> 01:23:31,274
Feeling as though every axiom in
your life turned out to be false...

1377
01:23:31,276 --> 01:23:33,976
and there was actually nothing.

1378
01:23:35,244 --> 01:23:38,045
And that you were nothing.

1379
01:23:38,047 --> 01:23:42,382
And that it's all a delusion and you're
so much better than everybody...

1380
01:23:42,384 --> 01:23:44,684
'cause you can see
how this is just a delusion,

1381
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:48,020
and you're so much worse because
you can't fucking function.

1382
01:23:52,124 --> 01:23:54,291
It's really horrible.

1383
01:24:00,130 --> 01:24:02,831
I don't think
that we ever change.

1384
01:24:06,468 --> 01:24:09,503
I'm sure that I still have
those same parts of me.

1385
01:24:15,910 --> 01:24:19,412
Guess I'm trying really hard to
find a way not to let them drive.

1386
01:24:23,316 --> 01:24:24,983
You know?

1387
01:24:33,991 --> 01:24:37,760
Hey, um, okay. Good night.

1388
01:25:14,561 --> 01:25:17,062
Hi.

1389
01:25:17,064 --> 01:25:19,064
Okay. Hi.

1390
01:25:25,070 --> 01:25:28,405
Hey. Good morning. Good morning.

1391
01:25:44,286 --> 01:25:45,919
Mornin', man.

1392
01:25:55,295 --> 01:25:58,096
Come on, boys.
Let's go. Good boys.

1393
01:25:59,565 --> 01:26:01,399
Come on. What are you doing?

1394
01:26:09,340 --> 01:26:10,973
Jeeves!

1395
01:26:11,941 --> 01:26:13,574
Jeeves, come on, boy.

1396
01:26:22,316 --> 01:26:27,653
You get instantaneous production from the
Jeeve-meister. Drone's a much tougher nut.

1397
01:26:27,655 --> 01:26:31,223
- It is so beautiful out here.
- Yeah.

1398
01:26:31,225 --> 01:26:33,925
You should see it in the spring
when the wind blows.

1399
01:26:33,927 --> 01:26:37,261
You can see ripples.
It's like water.

1400
01:26:37,263 --> 01:26:40,464
- It's like the ocean, but real green.
- Mmm.

1401
01:26:40,466 --> 01:26:42,199
It really is.

1402
01:26:44,169 --> 01:26:46,802
It's kind of calm. Real pretty.

1403
01:26:48,805 --> 01:26:51,740
You hungry? Uh, yeah. Kind of.

1404
01:26:51,742 --> 01:26:55,743
But, um... God, I don't
think I want to go back.

1405
01:26:56,578 --> 01:26:58,211
Yeah, I know how you feel.

1406
01:27:02,615 --> 01:27:05,383
Should probably get going though.
Okay.

1407
01:27:05,385 --> 01:27:09,853
Hey, let me take you someplace
nice this time. It'll be on Jann.

1408
01:27:12,991 --> 01:27:14,824
Thanks for holding the bag, man.
Of course.

1409
01:27:14,826 --> 01:27:17,159
I gotta eat something. I'm,
like, suddenly starving. Mmm.

1410
01:27:22,397 --> 01:27:24,898
You don't like pickles.
Oh, come on.

1411
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:26,633
What? What, the whole
world needs to know...

1412
01:27:26,635 --> 01:27:28,701
what my mother's known for
years... I'm a picky eater?

1413
01:27:28,703 --> 01:27:30,436
Okay, I'm putting it away.
Thank you.

1414
01:27:30,438 --> 01:27:31,937
All right.

1415
01:27:31,939 --> 01:27:33,438
Can I give 'em a fry?

1416
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:34,739
No. Come on.

1417
01:27:34,741 --> 01:27:36,540
All right, go for it.
Hey, Jeeve-meister.

1418
01:27:36,542 --> 01:27:38,141
Hey!

1419
01:27:39,109 --> 01:27:40,375
Watch this. What?

1420
01:27:40,377 --> 01:27:43,378
Jeeves. Jeeves. Sit.

1421
01:27:43,380 --> 01:27:46,581
Jeeves, sit. Sit.

1422
01:27:46,583 --> 01:27:48,182
Sit. Perfect.

1423
01:27:48,184 --> 01:27:51,952
Sit. God. Drone gets super
obedient when food is around.

1424
01:27:51,954 --> 01:27:54,220
Jeeves is still
kind of a wild man.

1425
01:27:54,222 --> 01:27:57,189
Do not leave food out around him.
He will go for it.

1426
01:27:57,957 --> 01:27:59,958
Good boy.

1427
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:01,492
You're such a good...

1428
01:28:01,494 --> 01:28:04,094
You're not gonna make me look like
I'm one of those insane old women...

1429
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:06,196
who talks to their dogs, are you?
Um, no.

1430
01:28:06,198 --> 01:28:07,597
Don't worry about it.

1431
01:28:07,599 --> 01:28:09,966
I am worried about it. My
dogs are gonna be offended.

1432
01:28:09,968 --> 01:28:12,635
The dogs are not gonna
read this article.

1433
01:28:12,637 --> 01:28:14,837
I gotta tell you. Hmm?

1434
01:28:14,839 --> 01:28:17,639
They've never taken to a man
the way they've taken to you.

1435
01:28:17,641 --> 01:28:19,040
Really? Nah.

1436
01:28:19,042 --> 01:28:20,808
Except me, of course.
Yeah. Yeah.

1437
01:28:20,810 --> 01:28:23,210
Oh. Can you hold this?

1438
01:28:23,212 --> 01:28:25,145
Yeah, of course.

1439
01:28:31,317 --> 01:28:32,884
Hello?

1440
01:28:33,652 --> 01:28:35,986
Hey.

1441
01:28:36,854 --> 01:28:38,855
Yes, I would like to, um...

1442
01:28:38,857 --> 01:28:40,857
I can't right now.
I got this guy here.

1443
01:28:40,859 --> 01:28:42,592
<i>What guy?</i>

1444
01:28:45,428 --> 01:28:47,562
<i>Rolling Stone</i> guy, yeah.

1445
01:28:48,463 --> 01:28:50,664
You know, can I just
meet you there?

1446
01:28:51,732 --> 01:28:54,834
Okay. Great. Yeah, perfect.

1447
01:28:54,836 --> 01:28:56,836
I'll see you then. Bye.

1448
01:29:00,639 --> 01:29:02,239
All right. Well, I should...

1449
01:29:02,241 --> 01:29:05,008
I should probably get out of here,
let you get on with your life.

1450
01:29:05,010 --> 01:29:09,711
That's, no... It's... There's just
this dance that I like to go to.

1451
01:29:10,546 --> 01:29:12,346
Sorry. You dance?

1452
01:29:12,348 --> 01:29:14,014
Yeah.

1453
01:29:14,016 --> 01:29:16,416
It's something I've discovered over
the past couple years I really like.

1454
01:29:16,418 --> 01:29:17,884
Although I'm not that good
at it yet.

1455
01:29:17,886 --> 01:29:19,819
Wait, sorry.
What kind of dancing?

1456
01:29:20,754 --> 01:29:23,355
I tend to do, like,
the jerk, the swim.

1457
01:29:23,357 --> 01:29:26,057
You know, like,
cheesy '70s disco.

1458
01:29:26,059 --> 01:29:29,126
Really? Yeah. It's one of the
things about living in Bloomington.

1459
01:29:29,128 --> 01:29:31,661
It's like a time warp. You're
completely hip if you do that.

1460
01:29:31,663 --> 01:29:34,830
Yeah, right. So, where do you go?
To a club?

1461
01:29:35,798 --> 01:29:37,532
I go to this Baptist church.

1462
01:29:38,433 --> 01:29:39,966
Why... Why do you go there?

1463
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:42,200
Baptists can dance.

1464
01:29:42,202 --> 01:29:45,369
Wow. Dancing.

1465
01:29:45,371 --> 01:29:47,137
I will not vogue.

1466
01:29:47,139 --> 01:29:50,406
<i>That is where I put my foot
down. I do not vogue.</i>

1467
01:29:50,408 --> 01:29:53,475
<i>Yeah. It's really cool though.
Like a lot of people show up.</i>

1468
01:29:53,477 --> 01:29:55,743
<i>And they got their
dancin' shoes on.</i>

1469
01:29:55,745 --> 01:30:00,013
<i>It's good. It's nice. Everyone for the
most part just leaves each other alone.</i>

1470
01:30:04,717 --> 01:30:07,385
<i>I thought it might be nice
before you go, if...</i>

1471
01:30:07,387 --> 01:30:11,522
Uh, maybe we could exchange
address data or something?

1472
01:30:11,524 --> 01:30:13,156
Yeah. Absolutely.

1473
01:30:13,158 --> 01:30:16,492
<i>Yeah. I'll get my stuff together.
Great.</i>

1474
01:30:16,494 --> 01:30:20,562
<i>I'll start carving an ice sculpture out of
my car. It's like Antarctica out there.</i>

1475
01:30:43,284 --> 01:30:47,487
Uh, dog stuff. Throw toys. Chew toys.
Crap stains on carpet.

1476
01:30:47,489 --> 01:30:52,391
Uh, fireplace. American flag.
Shark doll on bookcase.

1477
01:30:52,393 --> 01:30:54,626
Alanis poster. Uh, soda cans.

1478
01:30:54,628 --> 01:30:57,028
Lots of them. There's Pepsi.
There's Mountain Dew.

1479
01:30:57,030 --> 01:31:00,898
Um, looks like a frat.
A kind of bookish frat.

1480
01:31:00,900 --> 01:31:03,600
Uh, there's a Botticelli
calendar... <i>Birth of Venus.</i>

1481
01:31:03,602 --> 01:31:07,703
Uh, wooden chess set.
Postcard of Updike.

1482
01:31:07,705 --> 01:31:12,673
Um, brain comparison...
Male, female, dog. Cartoon.

1483
01:31:14,075 --> 01:31:16,509
In the bedroom, there is a
Barney towel used as a curtain.

1484
01:31:16,511 --> 01:31:19,278
There is a tennis ball. There's
a dental floss on top of books.

1485
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:22,481
There's a photo collage of his family,
the kind kids put in their dorm rooms.

1486
01:31:22,483 --> 01:31:26,418
His sister is kind of pretty. She
looks like a female version of him.

1487
01:31:26,420 --> 01:31:30,521
There is, uh, stuff everywhere. Clothes
everywhere. Sneakers on the floor.

1488
01:31:30,523 --> 01:31:32,322
Clothes draped over stuff.

1489
01:31:34,158 --> 01:31:35,825
Uh...

1490
01:31:35,827 --> 01:31:39,094
Blue toilet-seat cover,
looks like a rug.

1491
01:31:39,096 --> 01:31:42,497
Postcards.
Clintons, um, baboons.

1492
01:31:42,499 --> 01:31:45,199
A Saint Ignatius quote.

1493
01:31:45,201 --> 01:31:48,202
"Lord, teach me to be generous. Teach
me to serve you as you deserve."

1494
01:31:48,204 --> 01:31:52,039
To give and not to count the cost.
To toil and not to seek for rest.

1495
01:31:52,041 --> 01:31:55,008
To labor and not to ask
for reward...

1496
01:31:55,010 --> 01:31:58,377
"save that of knowing
that I do your will."

1497
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:27,460
Hey.

1498
01:33:27,462 --> 01:33:30,362
Tell you what. Riding around
in that rental of yours.

1499
01:33:30,364 --> 01:33:33,498
That feeling of gliding? This thing
doesn't even have shock absorbers.

1500
01:33:33,500 --> 01:33:35,032
What... What is it?

1501
01:33:35,034 --> 01:33:36,633
It's just an old Civic.

1502
01:33:36,635 --> 01:33:39,736
I know it doesn't look like much.
But, man, this thing starts.

1503
01:33:39,738 --> 01:33:42,405
It's actually a problem.
Why is that a problem?

1504
01:33:42,407 --> 01:33:45,273
I gotta get a new one, but I
can't junk this. Why not?

1505
01:33:46,341 --> 01:33:47,574
It's my friend.

1506
01:33:47,576 --> 01:33:49,342
Ah.

1507
01:33:51,945 --> 01:33:53,512
Hey, David. I, uh...

1508
01:33:54,714 --> 01:33:56,548
Wow. Just happened
to have one on you, huh?

1509
01:33:56,550 --> 01:34:00,751
Yeah. I mean, I... I did debate
whether or not I should do this.

1510
01:34:00,753 --> 01:34:02,385
Why? I don't know.

1511
01:34:02,387 --> 01:34:06,155
Don't you think it's some kind of
kid-brother sort of thing to do?

1512
01:34:06,157 --> 01:34:09,391
No. Thank you. I look
forward to reading this.

1513
01:34:09,393 --> 01:34:13,661
Oh, you're welcome. I put my
address and e-mail on the flyleaf.

1514
01:34:13,663 --> 01:34:16,697
Oh. Okay. Cool.

1515
01:34:16,699 --> 01:34:20,967
I'll, uh... Yeah, I'll read it after I finish
the Heinlein, and I'll send you a note.

1516
01:34:20,969 --> 01:34:23,970
That's great. Thanks.

1517
01:34:23,972 --> 01:34:26,838
Be interesting to be inside
your head for a while.

1518
01:34:28,774 --> 01:34:31,642
I like your cover.
Yeah. Yeah, me too.

1519
01:34:31,644 --> 01:34:34,978
I actually had them use the same
art for the British edition.

1520
01:34:34,980 --> 01:34:37,313
Come on. You got
approval, and I d...

1521
01:34:42,418 --> 01:34:43,818
It's nice. It's very nice.

1522
01:34:43,820 --> 01:34:47,421
Don't worry about it. It was not
such a... not such a big success.

1523
01:35:06,340 --> 01:35:09,208
Hey, isn't it at all reassuring to
have a lot of people read you...

1524
01:35:09,210 --> 01:35:11,943
and, you know, say that you're
a really strong writer?

1525
01:35:14,279 --> 01:35:16,980
It'll be interesting to
talk to you in a few years.

1526
01:35:16,982 --> 01:35:18,815
Why do you say that?

1527
01:35:19,983 --> 01:35:22,918
My experience is that
that is not so.

1528
01:35:25,254 --> 01:35:27,388
The more people think
you're really great,

1529
01:35:27,390 --> 01:35:30,157
actually the bigger the fear
of being a fraud is, you know?

1530
01:35:30,159 --> 01:35:33,293
The worst thing about getting a
lot of attention paid to you...

1531
01:35:33,295 --> 01:35:35,261
is that you're afraid
of bad attention.

1532
01:35:35,263 --> 01:35:37,796
And if bad attention hurts you,

1533
01:35:37,798 --> 01:35:41,632
the caliber of the weapon
pointing at you has gone way up.

1534
01:35:41,634 --> 01:35:45,002
Like from a .22 to a .45. Mmm.

1535
01:35:45,004 --> 01:35:48,771
Look, there are parts of me that want a lot
of attention and think I'm really great...

1536
01:35:48,773 --> 01:35:51,306
and want other people to see it.

1537
01:35:53,342 --> 01:35:57,044
I think that's one of the ways you
and I are sort of alike, you know?

1538
01:35:58,479 --> 01:36:02,114
All right. Hey, uh... All right.

1539
01:36:08,020 --> 01:36:10,121
Fuck. David.

1540
01:36:14,325 --> 01:36:16,592
I'm not so sure
you want to be me.

1541
01:36:17,560 --> 01:36:19,027
I don't.

1542
01:36:19,995 --> 01:36:22,429
Give my best to Jann.

1543
01:38:22,848 --> 01:38:25,049
<i>"When I think of this trip,".</i>

1544
01:38:25,051 --> 01:38:29,185
<i>I see David and me
in the front seat of his car.</i>

1545
01:38:29,187 --> 01:38:31,987
<i>We are both so young.</i>

1546
01:38:31,989 --> 01:38:34,222
<i>He wants something better
than he has.</i>

1547
01:38:34,224 --> 01:38:37,792
<i>I want precisely
what he has already.</i>

1548
01:38:37,794 --> 01:38:41,428
Neither of us knows where
our lives are going to go.

1549
01:38:42,763 --> 01:38:45,131
It smells like chewing tobacco,

1550
01:38:45,133 --> 01:38:48,701
soda and smoke.

1551
01:38:48,703 --> 01:38:52,771
And the conversation is
the best one I ever had.

1552
01:38:57,943 --> 01:39:03,046
<i>David thought books existed
to stop you from feeling lonely.</i>

1553
01:39:03,048 --> 01:39:06,516
<i>If I could, I'd say to David that
living those days with him...</i>

1554
01:39:06,518 --> 01:39:08,384
<i>reminded me
of what life is like,</i>

1555
01:39:08,386 --> 01:39:12,287
instead of being
a relief from it.

1556
01:39:13,722 --> 01:39:17,324
"And I'd tell him it made
me feel much less alone."

1557
01:40:49,482 --> 01:40:51,149
I need to use your bathroom
for a second.

1558
01:40:51,151 --> 01:40:53,751
I believe it's unoccupied.

1559
01:41:07,462 --> 01:41:09,830
It's me talkin'
into the tape recorder.

1560
01:41:13,234 --> 01:41:17,036
And Drone's sittin' behind me
just chillin' out.

1561
01:41:17,038 --> 01:41:20,873
I'm smoking. Having just said I
wouldn't smoke, I'm smoking.

1562
01:41:23,910 --> 01:41:26,344
Just me and your tape recorder.

1563
01:41:26,368 --> 01:41:42,368
