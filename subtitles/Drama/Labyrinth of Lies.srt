1
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:47,985
<i>No land more beautiful in this time</i>

2
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:52,823
<i>Than ours here, whether far or near...</i>

3
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:57,025
Don't worry.

4
00:00:57,658 --> 00:01:00,229
Adenauer will handle it. He's the captain.

5
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:01,498
Am I right?

6
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:06,235
I have two troublemakers in 6b.

7
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,246
I've never seen anything like it.
Completely wild.

8
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:12,680
And the parents won't do anything.

9
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:15,012
That's the way it is nowadays.

10
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:20,014
Hi there, pal.

11
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:22,217
Need a light?

12
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,792
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

13
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:43,404
LABYRINTH OF LIES

14
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:54,556
Public Prosecutor's Office

15
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:55,716
<i>Your Honor,</i>

16
00:01:56,249 --> 00:02:00,220
according to paragraph 2,
section 2 of our Constitution,

17
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:02,890
human life is the highest
inalienable right.

18
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:05,931
<i>The prosecution is convinced</i>

19
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,268
that the accused
acted maliciously and on base motives,

20
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:12,569
the preconditions for
paragraph 211, murder.

21
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:18,683
<i>I cannot see a justification for
the defense's plea of acting under duress.</i>

22
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:22,242
Therefore, the prosecution
requests the maximum sentence,

23
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:24,286
life imprisonment.

24
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,815
- Morning, Radmann.
- Morning.

25
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,757
How have the first weeks been?

26
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:32,760
Very exciting.

27
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:35,160
I'm only dealing with traffic violations.

28
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:36,801
We all had to do it.

29
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,931
Give it one or two years
and you'll get to clothe proper stuff.

30
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,643
Great.

31
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,173
<i>...as it stands,
women are still only allowed to work</i>

32
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,510
<i>with their husband's permission.</i>

33
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:54,608
<i>And now, Vino Torriani.</i>

34
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:57,353
Always do the right thing
Your father

35
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,517
Mr. Prosecutor, how nice of you to drop by.

36
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:38,360
- I apologize.
- We've started without you.

37
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:42,227
The defendant, Marlene Wondrak,
admits the offense,

38
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:45,666
but cannot afford the fine
of 50 Deutschmarks.

39
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:50,241
It was my boss' car. She mustn't find out,
and I only have 30 marks.

40
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,737
- Mr. Radmann.
- Yes?

41
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:59,350
With the prosecution's consent, we will
reduce the fine to 25 Deutschmarks.

42
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,746
And you promise you'll use your pretty
little head to concentrate on traffic,

43
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,187
if you absolutely have to drive a car.

44
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:08,758
All agreed?

45
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:11,755
No.

46
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:13,857
Come again?

47
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:18,761
The law determines the amount of the fine.
There are no grounds for an exception.

48
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,598
But I told you I don't have it.

49
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,900
The law doesn't allow for this.

50
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:27,375
You stickler, you monster!
You want to send me to jail for three days?

51
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:29,207
No, but...

52
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:35,709
So, Mr. Prosecutor, what
are we going to do?

53
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:42,117
There, I've paid.
Can I go now or must I still go to jail?

54
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,058
Don't think I'm grateful to you.
You'll get it back.

55
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:46,754
When I have it.

56
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,763
What an impossible person!

57
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:51,266
Damn it, she's got some spunk.

58
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:05,575
It's a scandal, an outrageous scandal!

59
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:08,583
There's a murderer on the loose out there.

60
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:10,812
Mr. Kirsch here recognized the man.

61
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:14,925
We've tried three police stations,
but none of them were interested.

62
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:16,958
Good day, Mr. Gnielka.

63
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:22,426
Desperate to find a story
for the <i>Rundschau</i> again?

64
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:24,933
I already have the story, Chief Prosecutor.

65
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:26,764
There's a murderer out there,

66
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:29,168
A former member
of the Waffen-SS at Auschwitz.

67
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,503
He now teaches children. Interested?

68
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:36,273
You really are a magnificent hothead.

69
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:38,278
I want to leave now, Gnielka.

70
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:40,610
This is just pointless.

71
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:52,026
Alois Schulz, Unterscharführer
in the Waffen-SS,

72
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,631
now teaches at the Goethe School.
Interested?

73
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:57,033
You?

74
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,497
You?

75
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,531
Out!

76
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:11,047
Come on, Simon, let's go.
Before I have to puke.

77
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:15,645
Throw this away.

78
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:18,881
Show is over, gentlemen. Back to work.

79
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:44,413
- Where is the school board, Schmittchen?
- At the Römer.

80
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,073
I'm sensing something.

81
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,048
And I don't like it.

82
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:13,743
- Eintracht will win the league.
- If Egon stays fit.

83
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:18,906
I checked out the records on this Schulz.
The years from '39 to '45 are missing.

84
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:20,107
On who?

85
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,879
That teacher the journalist talked about.

86
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:27,116
Well, someones ambitious here.

87
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,625
After '45 the US confiscated
truckloads of documents.

88
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:34,061
The denazification by the Allies is a fact.

89
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,757
Gnielka has no loyalty to the fatherland.

90
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:40,229
Don't be fooled.

91
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:00,788
Excuse me, the document center?

92
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:02,949
- Second floor.
- Thank you.

93
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:08,790
Sorry, but the document center
isn't open to the public.

94
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:10,832
I'm researching this person's past.

95
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:14,097
He teaches children.
I need to know what he did in the war.

96
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:16,265
He was a Nazi.

97
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:18,102
You were all Nazis,

98
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:21,336
just like in the Eastern Sector,
suddenly you're all Communists.

99
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,344
Jeez, you Germans!

100
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:28,446
If little green men landed from Mars,
suddenly you'd all be little green men.

101
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:31,445
Kid, you're too young.

102
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:33,783
But your father was a Nazi.

103
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:37,156
What? No. He hated the Nazis.

104
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:41,788
Yeah, sure. Everyone became
a resistance fighter after '45.

105
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,826
And you are here by which authority?

106
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:49,539
Public Prosecutor's Office, Frankfurt.

107
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:35,714
Good morning.

108
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,921
Therefore I shall request
a three-year sentence.

109
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,889
Good work, Haller.

110
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:47,020
If you have nothing else, Attorney General,
I'll close this meeting.

111
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,098
Chief Prosecutor.

112
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:53,029
Yes, Mr. Radmann?

113
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:55,730
- This teacher, Mr. Schulz...
- Which Schulz?

114
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:57,431
Mr. Gnielka's matter.

115
00:09:58,031 --> 00:09:59,874
I beg your pardon?

116
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:03,537
I did some research.
Schulz was indeed in the Waffen-SS.

117
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:08,948
He didn't disclose this
when he was employed in 1947.

118
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:13,752
He's not allowed to work as a teacher.
I wrote a report.

119
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,587
Let's have a look.

120
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,406
Yes, interesting.

121
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:32,907
You know what? I'll forward this
to the Ministry of Education.

122
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:36,437
Gentlemen, same time next Wednesday.

123
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,922
Your mother left this for you.

124
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:50,993
- What? When?
- Just now.

125
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:54,655
She wanted to wait, but your father
outside was honking impatiently.

126
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:55,993
That's how men are!

127
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:59,433
That's not my father.

128
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:04,507
He's been missing since '45. Eastern front.

129
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,777
I'm sorry.

130
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:15,009
- He didn't really say that!
- Scout's honor.

131
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,620
Mr. Gnielka.

132
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:19,289
- Do you remember? You...
- I know who you are.

133
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:21,288
I took care of that Schulz matter.

134
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:23,358
The ministry has suspended him.

135
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,292
Suspended?

136
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,294
What do you accuse him of?
Who do you think he killed?

137
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:33,699
He was stationed at Auschwitz.
Don't you know what that means?

138
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,363
Wasn't it a protective custody camp?

139
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:41,035
Believe me, no one was protected there.
I can't believe this.

140
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:42,202
Watch this.

141
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,871
Ever heard of Auschwitz, darling?

142
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,642
- No.
- That is what's scandalous.

143
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:50,651
- Ever heard of Auschwitz?
- No, and I'm busy.

144
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:53,891
- How old are you?
- 20.

145
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,654
- And you've never heard of Auschwitz?
- No.

146
00:11:57,517 --> 00:12:02,023
Mankind's biggest atrocity
is simply denied and forgotten.

147
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:03,997
What are you talking about?

148
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:10,064
A German prosecutor not knowing
what happened at Auschwitz is a disgrace.

149
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:16,408
And if this Schulz has been suspended,
I'll eat my hat.

150
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:27,016
We don't have any guidebooks on Poland.

151
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,091
No one ever goes there.

152
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:30,728
And as to this...

153
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:33,022
- Auschwitz.
- That's it, Auschwitz.

154
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:35,359
There are two books on it.

155
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:38,525
One is out of print,
the other should be in Kassel.

156
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:40,193
- Shall I order it?
- Please.

157
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,362
It will take eight to ten weeks.

158
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:08,757
Yes, can I help you?

159
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:22,243
Chief Prosecutor, may I have a word?

160
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:25,645
Magnificent, I would like one of those.

161
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,474
What's up?

162
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,747
Schulz is still teaching.
I went to the Goethe School.

163
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:35,449
There was a shortage of teachers.
It's a matter for the ministry.

164
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:38,824
It's beyond my authority,
and definitely beyond yours.

165
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:41,090
But Schulz was stationed at Auschwitz.

166
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:44,258
They all had those camps.
The Americans, the Russians.

167
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:46,495
I myself spent a year in a French one.

168
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:50,300
Don't tell my wife,
but their cooking was better than hers.

169
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:56,838
I was forced
to watch a film about it after the war.

170
00:13:57,003 --> 00:14:00,007
It's all propaganda.
The victors get to make up stories.

171
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:04,315
That's what happens when you lose a war.
But why start digging now?

172
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:09,456
Hi there. You were right.

173
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:12,994
- What do you mean?
- That teacher is still teaching.

174
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:15,326
Well, what can you do?

175
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:21,699
That reporter was waiting for you
in your office.

176
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,534
What a funny guy.

177
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:43,493
"Young and ambitious prosecutor Radmann"

178
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:47,722
"researched the past
of senior teacher Schulz."

179
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:51,494
"The Ministry of Education
was already informed on March 25th"

180
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:55,332
"and has been ignoring his Waffen-SS
membership for six weeks."

181
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:57,668
And so on... "Outrageous scandal."

182
00:14:58,831 --> 00:14:59,832
Oh, boy.

183
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:03,545
I wouldn't want to be
in your shoes right now.

184
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,512
The Attorney General wants to see you.

185
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:11,712
Mr. Radmann, the article
contains internal information.

186
00:15:11,878 --> 00:15:13,050
Did you pass this on?

187
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:15,859
No.

188
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:25,528
- But why didn't the ministry take action?
- Don't be so naive.

189
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:30,538
Do you think all Nazis vanished
into thin air after Hitler's death?

190
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:33,233
I can assure you they did not.

191
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:41,377
They did not.

192
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,946
But he can't be allowed to teach children.

193
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:48,888
What we should do is put the man on trial.

194
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:55,054
But having been stationed at this camp is
no criminal offense according to our law.

195
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:56,723
Shameful as it is.

196
00:15:56,889 --> 00:16:00,132
And any crimes would have been
time-barred three years ago.

197
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,102
Except for murder.

198
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:05,232
But do we have one? An actual murder?

199
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:07,408
Is there an actual victim?

200
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,739
Open your eyes, Mr. Radmann.

201
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:13,941
The public sector is full of Nazis,
big ones as well as little ones.

202
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:16,612
And none of them has anything to fear.

203
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:26,760
Latest evening edition!

204
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:30,162
Evening edition!
Khrushchev renews ultimatum!

205
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:34,465
Report on the anniversary of Hiroshima!

206
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:39,106
Have you lost your mind?

207
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:40,335
The article was a hit.

208
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,674
- I'll sue you for stealing the file.
- I'm quaking in my boots.

209
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:47,010
You nearly had me fired.
You should be ashamed!

210
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:50,950
I'd be ashamed if I didn't make
this kind of story public.

211
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:55,690
I just don't get it.

212
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,452
How can all this be kept secret?

213
00:16:57,617 --> 00:17:00,962
How? Easy!
They all did the same thing Schulz did.

214
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,193
They came home, hung up their uniforms
and carried on as if nothing had happened.

215
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:08,362
No one asks questions
because no one wants to know.

216
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:11,703
Are you free tonight? I'm sorry.

217
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:15,209
Reporters sometimes bend the rules.
Not to worry.

218
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:16,972
Come by.

219
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:19,377
There'll be pretty girls, sausages, beer.

220
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,678
Not necessarily in that order.

221
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,202
Typical male. They need water.

222
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:49,676
I'm Inge. The beer is back there.

223
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:51,007
Thanks.

224
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:20,071
She has class, hasn't she?

225
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,046
Come, I'll introduce you.

226
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,438
I can do that myself.

227
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:30,952
Ladies and gents' friends and combatants,
I've discovered a rare specimen.

228
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:36,253
An attorney whose armored chest still
contains a delicate flicker of humanity.

229
00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:38,885
- So you're a poet after all.
- Thanks, Simon.

230
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:41,930
Please make him feel welcome
in our anarchic circle,

231
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:45,763
so that the flicker
may eventually become a raging flame.

232
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:10,920
That was theft, wasn't it?
Are you going to arrest me?

233
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:14,587
Petty larceny.
I'll put you behind bars for six weeks.

234
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:16,427
You wretched man.

235
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:18,296
Are you always like this?

236
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,267
Why don't you find out?

237
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,496
Maybe I will.

238
00:19:31,604 --> 00:19:33,277
You're suffocating.

239
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,505
- Someone needs to take Simon home.
- I'll drive.

240
00:20:29,662 --> 00:20:30,868
You're drunk.

241
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,407
I can drive.

242
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,838
Nice people, aren't they?

243
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:38,913
I saw it straightaway.

244
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,074
What do you mean?

245
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:47,188
She's a cutie, a dame,
a doll face, a sugar babe.

246
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:49,724
And Marlene likes you, Radmann.

247
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:59,267
And he was actually imprisoned there?

248
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:02,027
Yes, but he doesn't talk about it.

249
00:21:25,918 --> 00:21:27,591
<i>The Angel of Death.</i>

250
00:21:28,087 --> 00:21:30,966
The first painting he did after Auschwitz.

251
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:36,838
Would you believe it, he's entitled
to compensation, but he doesn't want it.

252
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:39,466
Because of that damned claim form.

253
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:42,476
Those idiots want proof
that he was at Auschwitz.

254
00:21:42,568 --> 00:21:44,275
Is there anything I can do?

255
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,844
Yes, give me a hand.

256
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:55,425
There must be something here.

257
00:21:56,582 --> 00:21:57,959
Nothing.

258
00:21:58,284 --> 00:21:59,627
Get this suitcase down.

259
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:01,458
But I can't just...

260
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,316
No, let me do that.

261
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:31,693
Jackpot.

262
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,803
What are you doing?

263
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:45,898
We're helping you.

264
00:22:45,998 --> 00:22:47,136
How dare you?

265
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:48,505
Simon.

266
00:22:48,634 --> 00:22:51,376
I don't want your help.

267
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:54,381
You have no right to go through my things.

268
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,848
- Simon...
- Out. Out!

269
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:57,810
Out!

270
00:22:58,177 --> 00:22:59,178
Out!

271
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:02,486
He's stubborn.

272
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,056
But maybe these contain something.

273
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:09,928
- So you learned something after all.
- I'll return them, of course.

274
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:13,336
Nothing in here.

275
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:14,894
Nothing in here either.

276
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:19,100
This one has an Auschwitz
concentration camp letterhead.

277
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:27,248
Have a look at this.

278
00:23:28,841 --> 00:23:31,117
"Shot while trying to escape."

279
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,245
So?

280
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:36,121
"Shot while trying to escape" means murder.

281
00:23:36,215 --> 00:23:39,253
And here it lists the
names of the murderers.

282
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:43,393
Order reigns supreme.
Unbelievable, isn't it?

283
00:23:45,224 --> 00:23:46,760
Come with me.

284
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:53,607
Sorry to disturb you,
but I think it's important.

285
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:58,575
These are official lists
of the Auschwitz camp administration.

286
00:23:58,704 --> 00:24:01,116
The names of SS men who shot prisoners.

287
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,753
Look, "Schmidt, Milde, Siebert..."

288
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:08,389
That's what you wanted.
This is proof, isn't it?

289
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:11,489
Come in.

290
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:27,576
Where did you get this?

291
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:31,105
From an Auschwitz survivor.

292
00:24:35,441 --> 00:24:36,749
Good.

293
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:41,087
It's a start.

294
00:24:42,081 --> 00:24:43,253
- How?
- What?

295
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:48,098
These are concrete criminal offenses,
perpetrators, victims, times.

296
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:50,290
The prosecutor can act on this.

297
00:24:50,456 --> 00:24:51,935
So we'll investigate them?

298
00:24:52,091 --> 00:24:55,334
Why investigate?
That's nitpicking. Here are the names.

299
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:57,770
These murderers must be arrested.

300
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,341
Don't be silly, Mr. Gnielka.

301
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,637
That alone won't be enough.

302
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:06,476
Attorney General, if at all possible,
I would like to be involved.

303
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:09,108
I would like to help.

304
00:25:09,308 --> 00:25:11,549
You won't help, Mr. Radmann.

305
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,792
You will lead the investigations.

306
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,999
And no more articles for the time being.

307
00:25:24,056 --> 00:25:26,195
Unless you want to warn the perpetrators.

308
00:25:27,126 --> 00:25:28,298
Agreed.

309
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:32,138
Gentlemen,

310
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:37,212
if we succeed in ultimately
charging these men in Germany,

311
00:25:37,803 --> 00:25:40,716
that would be quite extraordinary.

312
00:25:46,979 --> 00:25:48,083
Schmittchen!

313
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,092
- What is it?
- No more traffic violations.

314
00:25:56,255 --> 00:25:58,166
The start of a new life.

315
00:26:09,835 --> 00:26:13,078
- I don't know what you want.
- We took some documents from you.

316
00:26:13,672 --> 00:26:16,676
There was a list.
I need to know where you got it from.

317
00:26:16,842 --> 00:26:18,446
Was it in my suitcase?

318
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,182
I've no idea.

319
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:26,352
The liberation was chaotic,
we grabbed what we could.

320
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:28,122
Why do you want to know?

321
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:31,527
I'm investigating the crimes at Auschwitz.

322
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:35,604
You were there. Did you witness
criminal offenses during your stay?

323
00:26:36,295 --> 00:26:38,297
My "stay"?

324
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,444
What did this Schulz do?

325
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,875
He was a regular SS swine.

326
00:26:43,035 --> 00:26:45,037
But did you see him killing anyone?

327
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:48,384
No.

328
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:54,387
I need witnesses, Mr. Kirsch.
You need to give a statement.

329
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:55,786
What for?

330
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:57,450
Just look around.

331
00:26:57,883 --> 00:27:01,797
Petticoats in pink and baby blue.

332
00:27:02,321 --> 00:27:04,597
This country wants sugar-coating.

333
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:06,897
It doesn't want to know the truth.

334
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,904
Please let me get on with my work.

335
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:29,991
These are the names
of the suspects we are after, Officer.

336
00:27:30,082 --> 00:27:32,358
You must find out their whereabouts.

337
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:36,155
So, to summarize, they were at this camp
in Poland during the war,

338
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:39,598
and the police
should find them for killing people?

339
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:42,432
But they were soldiers?

340
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:44,767
Wasn't that their duty?

341
00:27:55,941 --> 00:27:57,284
I'll be in touch.

342
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:04,619
Good morning.

343
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:08,560
Who's going to prosecute
the parking offenders now, Radmann?

344
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:20,973
First: Addresses? Still alive?

345
00:28:36,315 --> 00:28:39,990
"You incur a speeding fine. Pay 100 marks."

346
00:28:40,152 --> 00:28:43,156
- Inge, lend your husband 100 marks.
- Serves you right.

347
00:28:43,322 --> 00:28:44,892
But I'm broke. Radmann.

348
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:46,161
Then you lose.

349
00:28:46,325 --> 00:28:47,998
The prosecutor shows no mercy.

350
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:51,505
- Some people must be punished.
- Sure, and all of them by you.

351
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:52,835
Only the ones I catch.

352
00:28:52,998 --> 00:28:55,103
Who hears my plea and lends me some cash?

353
00:28:55,267 --> 00:28:59,340
I'll build a house on Goethe Street
and open my own fashion studio.

354
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:03,008
Then I can stop sewing curtains
for Mrs. Brettschneider. Great!

355
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:05,018
Oh, no!

356
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:07,520
That's justice for you.

357
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,289
Everything's fine, children.

358
00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:33,548
Show yourselves, you dirty cowards!

359
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:35,378
You won't shut me up!

360
00:29:35,574 --> 00:29:38,885
- I write what I want about who I want!
- Thomas, are you crazy?

361
00:29:39,044 --> 00:29:40,614
Gnielka, please!

362
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,230
I told you the article was a hit.

363
00:29:50,389 --> 00:29:53,461
Do you understand now?
They're still everywhere.

364
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:10,814
I need the addresses of the survivors.
They are important witnesses.

365
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:15,322
You pay them compensation,
so you should have their addresses.

366
00:30:16,081 --> 00:30:19,028
No, we'll pick them up ourselves, then.

367
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:20,822
Yes. Goodbye.

368
00:30:23,255 --> 00:30:25,929
Schmittchen, take a dictation, please.

369
00:30:26,091 --> 00:30:29,834
Hermann Langbein leads
the association of Auschwitz survivors.

370
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:31,668
Please send him a telegram.

371
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:34,533
Dear Mr. Langbein...

372
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,683
- Mr. Langbein.
- Mr. Radmann.

373
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:45,448
Thanks for coming.

374
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:47,951
Where's the witness?

375
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:51,294
Mr. Bichinsky, what's keeping you?

376
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,291
Schmittchen, our first witness.

377
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:02,968
Mr. Bichinsky, you were detained
at Auschwitz for two years.

378
00:31:03,462 --> 00:31:06,966
Yes, I was there from August 1943

379
00:31:07,132 --> 00:31:10,238
until the Russians liberated us
in January 1945.

380
00:31:17,743 --> 00:31:19,552
Just carry on, please.

381
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:31,492
Do you recognize the names on this list?

382
00:31:37,162 --> 00:31:39,073
No.

383
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,743
- Not a single one? Are you sure?
- Yes.

384
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:52,018
Can you testify to the fact
that crimes were committed in the camp?

385
00:31:52,177 --> 00:31:53,247
Yes, I can.

386
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:58,517
Hundreds of thousands were killed there.

387
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:16,777
Well, we would need
the names of the victims.

388
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:23,946
Didn't you hear?

389
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:25,952
Hundreds of thousands, it was a factory.

390
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:28,557
How is he supposed to know the names?

391
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:31,655
All right.

392
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:36,962
Then we'll write "victims unknown."

393
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:42,630
My wife and my son were murdered there.

394
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:48,667
I'm sorry.

395
00:32:56,808 --> 00:33:01,348
Can you tell me the date
when this happened?

396
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,755
The SS didn't give us a calendar...

397
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:10,096
What do you think Auschwitz was like?

398
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:13,363
A little summer camp by a lake?

399
00:33:15,093 --> 00:33:17,767
Mr. Bauer, what kind of greenhorn is this?

400
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:25,470
Can I talk to you for a minute?

401
00:33:26,538 --> 00:33:29,542
Would you like some coffee?
Schmittchen, coffee, please.

402
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:31,449
We'll be back shortly.

403
00:33:36,448 --> 00:33:38,519
We can't investigate only that list.

404
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,629
What do you suggest?

405
00:33:42,621 --> 00:33:46,728
I'll ask Bichinsky what he has seen.
Actual crimes he can testify to.

406
00:33:46,992 --> 00:33:50,963
This means that all SS men
who served at Auschwitz are suspects.

407
00:33:52,464 --> 00:33:55,240
- All of them.
- I'm aware of that.

408
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,244
I want to know what happened there.

409
00:34:15,654 --> 00:34:17,224
Mr. Radmann...

410
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:19,927
This is a labyrinth.

411
00:34:20,025 --> 00:34:22,164
Don't lose yourself in it.

412
00:34:31,336 --> 00:34:35,216
Mr. Bichinsky, please tell me
everything you experienced.

413
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,377
Where should he start?

414
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:41,448
At the beginning.

415
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:38,637
What did he do?

416
00:35:39,004 --> 00:35:42,645
Hans Brandner hit my witness
with his whip until he passed out.

417
00:35:42,741 --> 00:35:44,414
My witness lost his right eye.

418
00:35:45,076 --> 00:35:47,147
And you know why Brandner did it?

419
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:52,253
Because my witness dared
to glance at him during roll call.

420
00:35:58,757 --> 00:36:01,169
- And now we'll arrest him.
- What? No.

421
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:03,272
- Why not?
- We have no charge.

422
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:04,999
- But...
- There was no murder.

423
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:07,440
Everything else is time-barred.

424
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:10,279
So what are we doing here?

425
00:36:10,435 --> 00:36:12,278
I must look at him.

426
00:36:13,438 --> 00:36:14,849
I must see what he's like.

427
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,781
- Thanks.
- You'll be as pretty as your mom.

428
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:20,445
You're a charmer, Mr. Brandner.

429
00:36:20,612 --> 00:36:22,114
I see.

430
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:25,790
Wait.

431
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:31,190
- Mr. Brandner?
- Yes?

432
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:33,860
I think we know each other.

433
00:36:34,793 --> 00:36:36,204
I can't remember.

434
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:37,965
I'm certain.

435
00:36:38,129 --> 00:36:39,472
I never forget a face.

436
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:43,979
I don't know.
You're not from around here, are you?

437
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:48,310
Try one of these. You
won't find any better.

438
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:51,485
I've got to start my delivery.

439
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,423
Come on.

440
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:12,672
Get my robe, Schmittchen, hurry!

441
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,604
Please stay seated.

442
00:37:19,037 --> 00:37:20,846
How do you expect this to work?

443
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:25,353
You want to fly in people from Poland,
Israel and God knows where.

444
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:28,583
We don't even have diplomatic ties
with these countries.

445
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:30,090
And what for?

446
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:34,355
To prove that someone did something
somewhere in Poland during the war.

447
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:38,365
These people are witnesses
to thousands of murder cases.

448
00:37:38,523 --> 00:37:41,868
Murder? Be realistic. Where is the intent?

449
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:46,099
We didn't have any choice.
Whoever refused was killed.

450
00:37:46,564 --> 00:37:49,943
Besides, all this was dealt with
at Nuremberg after the war.

451
00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:53,281
Only 150 men were convicted at Nuremberg.

452
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:58,880
By the Allies, not by the German
justice system. So this isn't settled yet.

453
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:03,788
I'm sorry, Chief Prosecutor, I thought
your court session was in the afternoon.

454
00:38:04,382 --> 00:38:05,884
It would be the first time

455
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:10,499
that a country charges its own soldiers
for their actions during a war.

456
00:38:10,889 --> 00:38:12,562
It's a non-starter.

457
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:17,467
You know what?

458
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:20,099
I love this country.

459
00:38:20,165 --> 00:38:21,838
I still do.

460
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,102
In spite of everything.

461
00:38:24,169 --> 00:38:26,342
It had to endure so much.

462
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:30,079
All you will achieve
is re-opening old wounds

463
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:32,485
that were just starting to heal.

464
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:40,919
Did you know that Bauer is a Jew?

465
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:43,698
He himself was in a camp in 1933.

466
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:46,161
He probably never got over that.

467
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,447
- Take it easy, Toni!
- Lenchen!

468
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,122
Toni, I told you to take it easy!

469
00:39:11,282 --> 00:39:12,955
No harm done.

470
00:39:16,788 --> 00:39:20,736
Daddy, this is Johann Radmann.
He took me home after the movies.

471
00:39:20,892 --> 00:39:23,031
Very pleased to meet you.

472
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:27,134
- Come on, I'll fix you dinner.
- Thanks, Lenchen.

473
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:43,491
- Debts are a matter of honor.
- No, this...

474
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:55,433
So, come again. What do you need?

475
00:39:56,094 --> 00:39:58,836
I'm investigating the Auschwitz camp.

476
00:40:00,098 --> 00:40:02,510
You're out of your mind.

477
00:40:02,667 --> 00:40:05,671
Nobody wants that. Not you, not us either.

478
00:40:05,937 --> 00:40:07,245
Just let things be.

479
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:09,079
Man, Hitler is gone.

480
00:40:09,674 --> 00:40:12,848
The Russians, they are the new enemy.

481
00:40:13,845 --> 00:40:17,349
I'll need the files of the SS men
who served at Auschwitz.

482
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:19,856
All of them.

483
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:31,306
10 million Nazis. Incredible, isn't it?

484
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:34,203
And those idiots wrote everything down.

485
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:38,213
If you believe you'll get
one of them in front of a court,

486
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:40,440
you might as well believe in Santa Claus.

487
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:42,881
I'm only interested in the Auschwitz ones.

488
00:40:43,041 --> 00:40:44,952
Did you bring a truck?

489
00:40:46,044 --> 00:40:48,115
There you go, 600,000 SS files.

490
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:50,818
About 8,000 of them served at Auschwitz.

491
00:40:51,716 --> 00:40:54,390
But you'll have to dig those out yourself.

492
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:31,031
Thank you.

493
00:41:48,773 --> 00:41:50,275
It was a machine.

494
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:51,852
What was?

495
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,216
Auschwitz.

496
00:41:53,378 --> 00:41:56,621
It was a murder machine
made up of 8,000 parts,

497
00:41:56,781 --> 00:42:00,388
small ones, big ones,
bureaucratic ones, sadistic ones...

498
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:05,964
Eight weeks ago, we had a list of 15,
now I've got 8,000 SS men serving there.

499
00:42:06,124 --> 00:42:09,037
That makes 8,000 suspects, Gnielka.

500
00:42:10,294 --> 00:42:13,036
My previous case
was driving without a license.

501
00:42:14,465 --> 00:42:17,969
Look at it this way,
more enemies, more honor.

502
00:42:18,136 --> 00:42:20,138
What are we drinking to?

503
00:42:22,673 --> 00:42:23,708
<i>Veritas.</i>

504
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:27,812
That was my fathers motto.

505
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:31,149
To the truth.

506
00:42:37,822 --> 00:42:39,995
8,000 Schulzes and Brandners.

507
00:42:40,425 --> 00:42:43,269
And I need witnesses for every one of them.

508
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:54,338
- Let us in.
- What do you want?

509
00:42:56,441 --> 00:42:57,511
You must testify.

510
00:42:57,708 --> 00:43:00,552
- To what?
- You are a witness, Mr. Kirsch.

511
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:02,850
I need your statement.

512
00:43:04,015 --> 00:43:07,019
- I won't talk about it.
- Simon, please.

513
00:43:07,185 --> 00:43:10,291
You must testify. You
owe it to the victims.

514
00:43:11,689 --> 00:43:13,191
What do I owe them?

515
00:43:13,357 --> 00:43:15,030
What do you want from me?

516
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:17,236
Haven't you had enough?

517
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:18,969
What do you want?

518
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:21,201
You want to investigate Auschwitz?

519
00:43:21,365 --> 00:43:23,743
You think that will change anything?

520
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:26,708
You have no idea.

521
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:28,913
No idea.

522
00:43:55,233 --> 00:43:56,610
Why?

523
00:43:58,569 --> 00:44:00,276
My girls.

524
00:44:02,507 --> 00:44:04,578
Ruth and Klara.

525
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:07,112
So young.

526
00:44:13,417 --> 00:44:18,264
We arrived in the middle of the night,
hundreds of us, thousands.

527
00:44:18,422 --> 00:44:20,698
We were cold and hungry. It was freezing.

528
00:44:20,858 --> 00:44:24,101
We were surrounded
by the SS with their dogs.

529
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:29,442
Everyone out, quick, quick, lining up.

530
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:33,514
My wife Hannah
was put on a truck straightaway.

531
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:36,813
Suddenly, there was this doctor.

532
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:41,112
He was wearing white gloves.

533
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:44,515
He looked like an angel.

534
00:44:46,284 --> 00:44:48,321
He was very calm.

535
00:44:49,453 --> 00:44:55,131
And then he knelt down
to look at Ruth and Klara.

536
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:03,738
He stroked Ruth's hair and smiled,
and then he said to me,

537
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:05,847
"Your twins are cute."

538
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:08,381
"I'll bring them to my ward."

539
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:11,149
And I thought, "He's a doctor."

540
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:17,652
"They'll be safe with him."

541
00:45:21,586 --> 00:45:25,591
Then the others told me
what Mengele did to twins.

542
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:35,675
That he tortures them with his experiments.

543
00:45:36,334 --> 00:45:40,373
That he injects them with viruses,
typhoid, TB, diphtheria.

544
00:45:40,538 --> 00:45:44,509
He cut them open without anesthetic.

545
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:47,053
He removed organs from their bodies.

546
00:45:47,211 --> 00:45:49,282
He stuck needles into their heads.

547
00:45:49,447 --> 00:45:51,859
He sewed twins together, little children,

548
00:45:52,016 --> 00:45:55,395
back to back, like Siamese twins.

549
00:45:57,521 --> 00:45:59,592
And I gave them to him.

550
00:46:12,036 --> 00:46:14,539
Why are they dead and I'm alive?

551
00:46:36,894 --> 00:46:39,272
We'll put this doctor on trial.

552
00:46:40,431 --> 00:46:41,910
I promise.

553
00:47:55,139 --> 00:47:57,585
There was a camp physician...

554
00:47:57,742 --> 00:47:59,983
Dr. Josef Mengele.

555
00:48:00,644 --> 00:48:02,248
So you know the stories?

556
00:48:04,982 --> 00:48:07,223
He's the one we must get, Dr.
Josef Mengele,

557
00:48:07,318 --> 00:48:09,821
he's the one, he is Auschwitz.

558
00:48:11,422 --> 00:48:13,663
All those who participated,

559
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:16,034
who didn't say no,

560
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:18,537
they are Auschwitz.

561
00:48:25,269 --> 00:48:27,215
How are you getting on?

562
00:48:29,874 --> 00:48:33,879
Calmly and matter-of-factly,
just say what you clearly remember.

563
00:48:36,113 --> 00:48:37,251
Mrs. Mandelbaum.

564
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:43,362
Please.

565
00:50:36,133 --> 00:50:37,976
All right, we will appeal.

566
00:50:38,135 --> 00:50:40,342
- You can do that, Haller.
- With pleasure.

567
00:50:40,504 --> 00:50:44,008
Chief Prosecutor, I request
support for my investigations.

568
00:50:44,742 --> 00:50:46,517
Have Mr. Haller join him.

569
00:50:46,677 --> 00:50:48,520
Attorney General, please.

570
00:50:48,679 --> 00:50:53,594
I can't do without Mr. Haller,
we're already stretched thin.

571
00:50:53,751 --> 00:50:56,493
This matter is of the highest priority.

572
00:50:56,654 --> 00:50:57,758
Please,

573
00:50:57,922 --> 00:51:00,596
even Chancellor Adenauer made it clear

574
00:51:00,691 --> 00:51:04,537
that we must draw a line
under this unfortunate chapter.

575
00:51:04,828 --> 00:51:06,330
A trial would be poison.

576
00:51:06,497 --> 00:51:07,999
On the contrary.

577
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:10,042
Hushing this up is poison.

578
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,874
Poison for our young democracy.

579
00:51:13,037 --> 00:51:17,349
And besides, I'm the one who decides
when to draw the line.

580
00:51:24,615 --> 00:51:25,855
This is my good suit.

581
00:51:26,016 --> 00:51:28,860
Right, you brief me,
then I'll develop a strategy,

582
00:51:29,019 --> 00:51:30,692
and you can then report to me.

583
00:51:30,854 --> 00:51:32,697
Don't worry, I won't bite.

584
00:51:32,856 --> 00:51:36,065
I'm in charge of the investigation,
on the General's orders.

585
00:51:36,226 --> 00:51:38,638
Well, well, look who's all grown up.

586
00:51:41,865 --> 00:51:43,037
Who are the suspects?

587
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,702
- Everyone.
- What do you mean?

588
00:51:44,868 --> 00:51:47,712
- Everyone who served there.
- That's ridiculous.

589
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:01,291
A small boy,

590
00:52:01,385 --> 00:52:05,128
about five years old, jumped off the truck.

591
00:52:05,422 --> 00:52:07,561
He was holding an apple.

592
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:09,764
Boger was standing at the door.

593
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:14,406
The boy stood next to the truck
and was so happy about the apple.

594
00:52:14,465 --> 00:52:17,446
Boger went up to the boy,
grabbed him by the feet

595
00:52:17,601 --> 00:52:20,445
and smashed his head against the wall.

596
00:52:20,504 --> 00:52:24,816
Boger then picked up the apple
and told me to clean up the wall.

597
00:52:25,109 --> 00:52:27,419
And then Boger ate the apple.

598
00:52:28,345 --> 00:52:31,019
Everyday life at Auschwitz.

599
00:52:31,181 --> 00:52:32,956
You find that ridiculous?

600
00:52:39,623 --> 00:52:41,694
How many of the addresses did you get?

601
00:52:41,792 --> 00:52:43,931
The authorities are stalling.

602
00:52:45,696 --> 00:52:48,142
- Get every phone book.
- Pardon me?

603
00:52:48,298 --> 00:52:51,802
I've had it!
Get every phone book in Germany.

604
00:52:51,969 --> 00:52:54,381
We'll look up the addresses ourselves.

605
00:53:50,928 --> 00:53:53,374
Mengele was the worst of all.

606
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:55,339
And you know why?

607
00:53:55,866 --> 00:53:57,038
He's like you and me.

608
00:53:57,201 --> 00:53:59,841
He had opportunities, became a doctor,

609
00:54:00,003 --> 00:54:03,007
took the Hippocratic oath,
loves opera, he's cultured.

610
00:54:03,173 --> 00:54:07,349
He's like us.
He was your age when he came to Auschwitz.

611
00:54:09,046 --> 00:54:11,048
I look at his photograph...

612
00:54:11,215 --> 00:54:14,025
Have you seen his photograph? He looks...

613
00:54:16,186 --> 00:54:18,188
He looks like a nice guy.

614
00:54:21,692 --> 00:54:25,799
If we let someone like him run free,
we are doomed, do you understand?

615
00:54:25,963 --> 00:54:28,409
Come on, Gnielka,
I want to dance with my hubby.

616
00:54:28,565 --> 00:54:30,374
- Come on, Johann.
- Just a second.

617
00:54:30,968 --> 00:54:32,709
Our hero is tired.

618
00:54:39,042 --> 00:54:41,921
You will nail this guy.
Don't worry about it.

619
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:45,758
Ladies, here I am.

620
00:55:01,265 --> 00:55:04,178
<i>Marching in spirit</i>

621
00:55:04,334 --> 00:55:07,281
<i>Within our ranks</i>

622
00:55:08,572 --> 00:55:12,611
<i>Our comrades shot by the Red From</i>

623
00:55:12,776 --> 00:55:14,949
What's going on there?

624
00:55:15,112 --> 00:55:17,092
It's my dad's war comrades.

625
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:19,955
They meet once a month to get drunk.
It's awful.

626
00:55:20,117 --> 00:55:24,088
Pioneer Battalion 221,
"Every shot downs a Russian."

627
00:55:27,257 --> 00:55:29,294
I can't handle this today.

628
00:55:32,763 --> 00:55:35,039
Let's go down to the river.

629
00:55:38,936 --> 00:55:41,712
No, take me to your place.

630
00:55:48,612 --> 00:55:50,785
My landlady has ears like a bat.

631
00:56:16,306 --> 00:56:18,377
Come on, I'll take you home.

632
00:57:28,912 --> 00:57:30,585
My darling.

633
00:57:55,238 --> 00:57:57,240
Life is beautiful.

634
00:58:43,453 --> 00:58:47,799
Can you tell me which country and city
has the area code 005411?

635
00:58:49,059 --> 00:58:50,504
Thanks, I'll wait.

636
00:58:51,128 --> 00:58:52,539
I know where Mengele is.

637
00:58:52,662 --> 00:58:53,902
What? Where?

638
00:58:54,064 --> 00:58:57,136
The long-distance calls
of the Mengele family in Günzburg.

639
00:58:57,567 --> 00:58:58,637
Thank you.

640
00:58:59,469 --> 00:59:01,176
Buenos Aires, Argentina.

641
00:59:01,338 --> 00:59:02,646
I'll go to the BKA.

642
00:59:02,806 --> 00:59:06,811
We have enough evidence against
this baker, Brandner. Issue a warrant.

643
00:59:06,977 --> 00:59:08,422
Yes, I will.

644
00:59:08,578 --> 00:59:10,683
Mengele is in Buenos Aires.

645
00:59:11,481 --> 00:59:14,655
This is his telephone number,
that should be sufficient.

646
00:59:14,818 --> 00:59:17,492
Here's the warrant for his arrest.

647
00:59:17,654 --> 00:59:19,861
Please have him brought to Germany.

648
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:22,692
Interesting theory.

649
00:59:25,328 --> 00:59:28,036
Unfortunately,
the Federal Police has limited means.

650
00:59:28,098 --> 00:59:30,942
And South America of all places.
It's so far away.

651
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:34,211
But I'll be happy to pass it on.

652
00:59:38,708 --> 00:59:40,449
I'll take you to the station.

653
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:43,618
- Don't worry.
- I insist. I'll drive you.

654
00:59:53,857 --> 00:59:55,564
Now we can talk.

655
00:59:57,961 --> 01:00:00,532
We knew that Mengele is in Buenos Aires.

656
01:00:00,697 --> 01:00:03,268
We have a thick file on him, but...

657
01:00:03,366 --> 01:00:04,606
But what?

658
01:00:05,869 --> 01:00:08,748
Those who fled after '45 are off-limits.

659
01:00:09,206 --> 01:00:11,413
An order from up high.

660
01:00:12,576 --> 01:00:14,578
Is there any way you can help me?

661
01:00:15,812 --> 01:00:18,588
We know he travels to Günzburg
to see his family.

662
01:00:18,748 --> 01:00:20,386
He comes back to Germany?

663
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:23,827
Regularly. He knows there
is hardly any risk.

664
01:00:27,491 --> 01:00:28,936
Thank you.

665
01:00:34,664 --> 01:00:38,271
I don't have time to take you to the
station. I just wanted to talk.

666
01:00:38,435 --> 01:00:40,073
I see. Of course.

667
01:00:43,573 --> 01:00:44,574
Thanks anyway.

668
01:00:52,582 --> 01:00:54,926
You've been to see the Federal Police.

669
01:00:55,685 --> 01:00:58,529
- How do you know?
- Have a seat.

670
01:01:04,261 --> 01:01:06,969
You're still not grasping
the extent of this.

671
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:11,101
Mengele, Eichmann and the rest
are protected by powerful friends.

672
01:01:11,268 --> 01:01:12,770
You can trust no one.

673
01:01:12,936 --> 01:01:14,313
No one at all.

674
01:01:14,471 --> 01:01:18,283
- But I know Mengele's whereabouts.
- I know, but you must let it rest.

675
01:01:18,441 --> 01:01:22,218
You obtained a warrant for his arrest,
just leave it at that.

676
01:01:24,948 --> 01:01:26,120
Attorney General...

677
01:01:26,283 --> 01:01:29,127
Concentrate on the other suspects

678
01:01:29,286 --> 01:01:31,960
and leave Mengele to me. Understood?

679
01:01:36,126 --> 01:01:37,799
You did say all of them.

680
01:01:38,962 --> 01:01:41,806
And we're to comb through
all of them for our suspects?

681
01:01:41,865 --> 01:01:42,866
Yes.

682
01:01:43,233 --> 01:01:44,974
I'm not carrying them.

683
01:01:46,169 --> 01:01:49,480
Your ideas always mean work for me.

684
01:02:07,157 --> 01:02:09,330
Mengele's father died.

685
01:02:09,492 --> 01:02:13,269
- Are your men at Günzburg?
- I told you what our position is.

686
01:02:14,197 --> 01:02:16,006
That's all I can do.

687
01:02:39,789 --> 01:02:41,132
Do you think he's inside?

688
01:02:41,291 --> 01:02:44,465
If Mengele ever comes to Germany, it's now.

689
01:02:47,697 --> 01:02:49,699
That stays there.

690
01:02:55,572 --> 01:02:57,574
PRIVATE FUNCTION TODAY

691
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:09,822
Can't you read? This is a private function.

692
01:03:09,986 --> 01:03:12,899
Johann Radmann,
Public Prosecutor's Office, Frankfurt.

693
01:03:13,056 --> 01:03:15,662
We are looking for Josef Mengele.

694
01:03:45,255 --> 01:03:47,098
You scared me.

695
01:03:47,624 --> 01:03:48,932
Thank you.

696
01:03:52,595 --> 01:03:54,768
Will you do something for me, too?

697
01:03:59,436 --> 01:04:01,609
Do you know where Mengele is?

698
01:04:02,205 --> 01:04:05,152
Everyone in Günzburg
works at the Mengeles' factory.

699
01:04:05,308 --> 01:04:06,946
They won't say anything.

700
01:04:09,779 --> 01:04:12,953
But my dad saw him at the cemetery today.

701
01:04:13,116 --> 01:04:14,618
He recognized him.

702
01:04:14,784 --> 01:04:17,162
But then he drove off.

703
01:04:18,321 --> 01:04:20,164
I've got to go back in.

704
01:04:20,957 --> 01:04:22,959
You hear a lot around here.

705
01:04:23,126 --> 01:04:26,073
I urge you to call me if he turns up again.

706
01:04:27,897 --> 01:04:30,537
- He did this to children.
- I don't want to see it.

707
01:04:30,633 --> 01:04:34,979
Take a good look.
This is what Josef Mengele did to children.

708
01:04:41,911 --> 01:04:44,016
I am certain he was at Günzburg today.

709
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:49,095
The Border Guard must check all passengers
to South America, flights and ships.

710
01:04:50,987 --> 01:04:52,694
No, not "Naegele", "Mengele."

711
01:04:52,856 --> 01:04:55,735
Mike, Echo, November,
Golf, Echo, Lima, Echo.

712
01:04:58,161 --> 01:05:03,270
Look again, he must be on the list.
There's a warrant out for him.

713
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:07,843
There's no time for a written request,
he'll be gone by then!

714
01:05:12,842 --> 01:05:14,685
I can't believe it!

715
01:05:27,223 --> 01:05:29,100
- Where have you been?
- Why?

716
01:05:29,192 --> 01:05:31,399
The baker, Brandner. He's disappeared.

717
01:05:31,861 --> 01:05:33,602
- What?
- He's disappeared, gone.

718
01:05:33,696 --> 01:05:36,768
Because you didn't issue
the warrant you promised.

719
01:05:37,066 --> 01:05:39,546
- You had to go play Zorro.
- You know that...

720
01:05:39,736 --> 01:05:40,908
I don't care!

721
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:45,617
We're public prosecutors.
Start acting like one.

722
01:05:46,376 --> 01:05:48,049
And stop drinking in my office.

723
01:05:51,881 --> 01:05:54,760
The Attorney General
wants to see you immediately.

724
01:05:54,918 --> 01:05:56,454
Goodbye.

725
01:06:02,225 --> 01:06:04,398
You've acted against my orders.

726
01:06:04,561 --> 01:06:07,599
Quiet. How could you let
this Brandner get away?

727
01:06:07,764 --> 01:06:10,745
You were busy
making a fool of yourself in Günzburg.

728
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:12,607
What were you thinking?

729
01:06:12,769 --> 01:06:14,305
He was at his father's funeral.

730
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:17,941
Why does he dare
come back to Germany? Why?

731
01:06:18,107 --> 01:06:19,984
Because he knows we'll let him go.

732
01:06:20,143 --> 01:06:24,114
You've been working on this case
for four months, Mr. Radmann.

733
01:06:24,247 --> 01:06:26,488
What have you got to show for it? Nothing.

734
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:28,822
We're running out of time.

735
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:32,125
For now, the Justice Minister
still supports me.

736
01:06:32,288 --> 01:06:35,098
But the state elections could change that.

737
01:06:35,625 --> 01:06:37,263
Then I'll be gone.

738
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:39,670
There won't be a trial anymore.

739
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:42,002
Without Mengele, the trial is pointless.

740
01:06:42,165 --> 01:06:44,941
Do you want to try a mere phantom?

741
01:06:47,136 --> 01:06:51,642
Your obsession with Mengele
jeopardizes the entire investigation.

742
01:06:51,808 --> 01:06:53,810
What about all the others?

743
01:06:53,977 --> 01:06:57,186
This Mulka, or Camp Commander Baer?

744
01:06:57,347 --> 01:07:01,295
These men are responsible
for hundreds of thousands of deaths.

745
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:03,729
Aren't they dramatic enough for you?

746
01:07:06,322 --> 01:07:07,801
Here.

747
01:07:11,661 --> 01:07:14,835
"If you carry on like this,
you'll be gassed, too."

748
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:19,206
"A traitor is the worst scum
in all the country."

749
01:07:22,805 --> 01:07:25,649
"Death or life, Jew?"
and so on and so forth.

750
01:07:26,342 --> 01:07:27,878
That's why we're doing this.

751
01:07:27,977 --> 01:07:31,481
The Germans must see
the crimes that were committed,

752
01:07:31,848 --> 01:07:35,990
not just by Hitler and Himmler,
but by completely ordinary people

753
01:07:36,152 --> 01:07:38,530
who did it voluntarily, out of conviction.

754
01:07:39,322 --> 01:07:41,199
They are the ones we're trying.

755
01:07:41,357 --> 01:07:43,030
One big trial.

756
01:07:43,192 --> 01:07:45,331
This is the way to do it.

757
01:07:45,495 --> 01:07:47,497
And this is your task.

758
01:08:02,211 --> 01:08:04,088
Mr. Mulka. Radmann, prosecutor.

759
01:08:04,247 --> 01:08:07,888
You couldn't answer our summons,
good to see you're well again.

760
01:08:08,051 --> 01:08:09,052
What do you want?

761
01:08:09,218 --> 01:08:12,256
You were Adjutant Camp Commander
at Auschwitz.

762
01:08:12,422 --> 01:08:15,028
- So?
- I'm investigating you.

763
01:08:15,224 --> 01:08:17,431
Listen, I was a soldier.

764
01:08:17,594 --> 01:08:19,870
I never set foot in that camp.

765
01:08:20,029 --> 01:08:21,872
I don't know what happened there.

766
01:08:22,031 --> 01:08:25,706
Who are you trying to fool?
You were the commanders right-hand man.

767
01:08:25,868 --> 01:08:27,279
I'll bring you to justice.

768
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:28,939
If you approach me again,

769
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:32,882
I'll cause you so much trouble
you won't know what hit you.

770
01:08:34,744 --> 01:08:37,088
- Let's call it a night.
- I'm carrying on.

771
01:08:38,982 --> 01:08:40,552
You know what, Radmann?

772
01:08:40,883 --> 01:08:42,885
You definitely are crazy.

773
01:08:43,753 --> 01:08:46,962
But you definitely aren't
a little green man.

774
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:50,763
Here, more photos of the ramp.

775
01:09:01,771 --> 01:09:03,773
Left, right,

776
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:05,248
left, right,

777
01:09:06,242 --> 01:09:07,414
left...

778
01:09:07,577 --> 01:09:09,750
Don't you know where left is, Anton?

779
01:09:09,912 --> 01:09:11,949
Right, left...

780
01:09:13,483 --> 01:09:15,656
Which of you rascals has misbehaved?

781
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:20,597
Alois Schulz, I'm arresting you for aiding
and abetting murder in hundreds of cases.

782
01:09:25,261 --> 01:09:27,263
I only did office work.

783
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:31,607
Here...

784
01:09:32,435 --> 01:09:33,937
That's you.

785
01:09:44,447 --> 01:09:45,448
Yes.

786
01:09:45,615 --> 01:09:48,824
Several witnesses testified
you made selections at the ramp.

787
01:09:48,985 --> 01:09:51,795
- You selected victims for the gas chambers.
- Yes, but...

788
01:09:51,954 --> 01:09:54,025
Mr. Schulz, please.

789
01:09:55,625 --> 01:09:57,298
It's like this.

790
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:00,136
You'll have to prove
that Mr. Schulz selected anyone.

791
01:10:00,963 --> 01:10:03,136
The picture is out of focus.

792
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:05,973
It seems this camp was a horrible place.

793
01:10:06,069 --> 01:10:10,074
I'm sure whoever arrived there,
after a grueling journey,

794
01:10:10,306 --> 01:10:11,910
was in a state of shock.

795
01:10:12,175 --> 01:10:17,523
I doubt very much that the testimonies
of those pitiable people are still valid

796
01:10:17,647 --> 01:10:19,490
after almost 20 years.

797
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:24,823
And assuming Mr. Schulz
did indeed select anyone,

798
01:10:25,088 --> 01:10:29,161
then the purpose was to prevent those
who were fit for work from being gassed.

799
01:10:29,525 --> 01:10:31,664
So he was in fact saving people's lives.

800
01:10:32,662 --> 01:10:34,369
You shut your mouth now!

801
01:10:40,403 --> 01:10:43,680
I disagree with your legal interpretation.

802
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:47,552
Mr. Schulz has stated
that he only followed orders,

803
01:10:47,777 --> 01:10:48,915
which was his duty.

804
01:10:49,011 --> 01:10:52,686
Mr. Lichter, your client is a murder
suspect and stays in custody.

805
01:11:01,057 --> 01:11:03,560
You should be gassed, you bastard.

806
01:11:06,863 --> 01:11:07,933
Gentlemen.

807
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:16,272
None of us were thinking.

808
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:20,083
All we had to do was open our eyes.

809
01:11:25,615 --> 01:11:26,992
Shit.

810
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,141
I've got one.

811
01:12:05,454 --> 01:12:07,263
- Hello.
- Oh, dear.

812
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:09,765
Wow.

813
01:12:09,926 --> 01:12:11,098
- I forgot.
- And?

814
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:14,764
- And what?
- This, you boor. I made it myself.

815
01:12:14,931 --> 01:12:16,672
- Yes, very nice.
- Respect.

816
01:12:16,766 --> 01:12:20,373
- Marlene, we're just...
- Come, we can't let the posh people wait.

817
01:12:20,603 --> 01:12:21,673
Off you go.

818
01:12:23,773 --> 01:12:24,843
Come on!

819
01:12:25,474 --> 01:12:27,283
The Americans had just let me go.

820
01:12:27,376 --> 01:12:31,188
I was 35 and had never worked as a lawyer.

821
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:33,858
And then my first client walked in,

822
01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:37,520
looking for a lawyer
to register a patent for him.

823
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:39,463
Free of charge, naturally.

824
01:12:40,489 --> 01:12:42,969
We've grown dramatically since then.

825
01:12:43,659 --> 01:12:46,469
- Why did they invite us?
- I don't know.

826
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:52,171
But I have a suspicion.

827
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:03,990
Boy, do they have potential.

828
01:13:04,146 --> 01:13:06,820
- I'm starving, Walter.
- Me, too.

829
01:13:07,149 --> 01:13:08,389
Shall we?

830
01:13:10,019 --> 01:13:12,556
I don't like to see
a good lawyer's talent wasted.

831
01:13:12,722 --> 01:13:14,395
Let me introduce you to Dr. Mertens.

832
01:13:16,726 --> 01:13:19,172
Excuse me. May I ask you something?

833
01:13:19,562 --> 01:13:23,374
Tell me, where in Frankfurt
can one find a dress like this?

834
01:13:23,532 --> 01:13:24,533
Oh, this...

835
01:13:24,734 --> 01:13:26,338
At her shop, of course.

836
01:13:26,836 --> 01:13:29,407
You have your own fashion studio?

837
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:33,547
I'm just starting out.

838
01:13:57,033 --> 01:13:59,570
Your fiancée? My compliments.

839
01:13:59,769 --> 01:14:01,442
But you're impressive, too.

840
01:14:01,737 --> 01:14:05,549
Honors degree,
assistant to Professor Rimmelsbacher.

841
01:14:05,708 --> 01:14:07,449
- That's correct, isn't it?
- Yes.

842
01:14:07,610 --> 01:14:11,888
You're exactly the kind of person I need,
young, enthusiastic.

843
01:14:12,048 --> 01:14:14,619
All that's required
is to channel that energy properly.

844
01:14:14,717 --> 01:14:17,095
- Thanks...
- I know.

845
01:14:18,621 --> 01:14:22,398
You don't have to decide now,
just bear it in mind.

846
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:25,064
You know where to find me now.

847
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:32,476
Four ladies ordered dresses from me.

848
01:14:32,635 --> 01:14:35,775
It's been a lovely evening, Johann.

849
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:49,922
This is Prosecutor Radmann.

850
01:14:50,786 --> 01:14:53,494
Mr. Radmann, this is Mr. Kleiner,

851
01:14:53,656 --> 01:14:56,432
German correspondent
of the Jerusalem Post.

852
01:14:56,592 --> 01:14:58,469
These two gentlemen are from Israel.

853
01:14:58,527 --> 01:14:59,835
Pleased to meet you.

854
01:14:59,929 --> 01:15:04,105
I asked Mr. Radmann to come because
he knows most about Josef Mengele,

855
01:15:04,266 --> 01:15:06,473
including his current location.

856
01:15:06,602 --> 01:15:11,210
We're cooperating to apprehend
Adolf Eichmann and Josef Mengele

857
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:14,353
in Argentina and bring them here.

858
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:17,787
Please share your information
with these gentlemen.

859
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:26,122
And you'll bring us Mengele?

860
01:15:27,023 --> 01:15:29,503
If anyone does it, it'll be us.

861
01:15:39,502 --> 01:15:42,210
Kleiner isn't just a journalist, is he?

862
01:15:42,304 --> 01:15:43,305
No.

863
01:15:48,010 --> 01:15:49,717
Can they be trusted?

864
01:15:49,879 --> 01:15:52,052
Who can you trust?

865
01:15:53,149 --> 01:15:56,756
I still live in exile,
only not in Sweden anymore.

866
01:15:56,852 --> 01:15:59,264
The moment I leave my office,

867
01:15:59,488 --> 01:16:01,934
I'm in enemy territory.

868
01:16:10,499 --> 01:16:12,501
I trust you.

869
01:16:28,384 --> 01:16:29,727
Watch out.

870
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:32,198
It's not dry yet.

871
01:16:33,722 --> 01:16:36,703
It's beautiful, Simon. Thank you.

872
01:16:36,859 --> 01:16:38,031
Johann!

873
01:16:44,733 --> 01:16:45,871
Now then...

874
01:16:47,937 --> 01:16:49,939
This is the big moment.

875
01:16:54,210 --> 01:16:57,054
- As good as new.
- I've always wanted one like this.

876
01:16:57,213 --> 01:16:58,283
To Marlene.

877
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:00,722
Cheers.

878
01:17:02,418 --> 01:17:05,092
"Dear housewife, your dream has come true."

879
01:17:05,254 --> 01:17:07,564
"The new Pfaff Automatic 230,"

880
01:17:07,723 --> 01:17:11,637
"the sewing machine with endless
possibilities, is yours."

881
01:17:12,728 --> 01:17:14,332
Great, isn't it?

882
01:17:14,430 --> 01:17:17,775
We're nearly there.
We'll put Mengele on trial in Frankfurt.

883
01:17:23,906 --> 01:17:25,817
"Make all your friends jealous"

884
01:17:25,975 --> 01:17:28,785
"and bring a smile to your husband's face."

885
01:17:36,418 --> 01:17:40,127
This is unbelievable,
falling asleep like this.

886
01:17:40,289 --> 01:17:44,465
Mr. Prosecutor can't get excited about
a sewing machine, even such a grand one.

887
01:17:44,627 --> 01:17:47,335
I was just closing my
eyes briefly because...

888
01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:52,809
Because I was blinded
by the beauty of your sewing machine.

889
01:17:52,868 --> 01:17:55,144
Careful, your nose is getting longer.

890
01:17:55,938 --> 01:17:59,181
A good businessman
keeps track of all transactions.

891
01:18:01,844 --> 01:18:03,323
Of course.

892
01:18:04,613 --> 01:18:06,286
You are wonderful.

893
01:18:11,453 --> 01:18:12,989
Thank you, Joseph.

894
01:18:13,155 --> 01:18:14,327
Mr. Mulka.

895
01:18:15,357 --> 01:18:17,303
This is a warrant for your arrest.

896
01:18:17,459 --> 01:18:18,961
What's all this?

897
01:18:19,128 --> 01:18:21,165
An accessory facilitates the offense.

898
01:18:21,330 --> 01:18:24,470
Here's an order for Zyklon B,
signed by Robert Mulka,

899
01:18:24,633 --> 01:18:26,806
Hauptsturmführer and adjutant.

900
01:18:27,670 --> 01:18:29,877
That was long ago, I don't remember it.

901
01:18:30,039 --> 01:18:32,485
You don't have to. This is enough.

902
01:18:32,641 --> 01:18:37,147
I'm arresting you for aiding
and abetting murder in thousands of cases.

903
01:18:39,882 --> 01:18:41,520
Come with us, please.

904
01:18:46,989 --> 01:18:49,333
Have a drink with us, Chief Prosecutor.

905
01:18:49,491 --> 01:18:52,734
You're getting younger every day,
how do you do it?

906
01:18:52,828 --> 01:18:54,102
Cheers!

907
01:18:55,864 --> 01:18:58,902
- Thai looks delicious.
- It's home-baked.

908
01:18:59,501 --> 01:19:02,744
Of course, the bakers
are all fleeing from Mr. Radmann.

909
01:19:04,506 --> 01:19:06,850
Where's your sheriff's badge?

910
01:19:07,009 --> 01:19:09,353
- What?
- Considering your cowboy methods,

911
01:19:09,578 --> 01:19:12,525
you should wear
a cowboy hat and a sheriff's badge.

912
01:19:14,016 --> 01:19:15,859
This is outrageous.

913
01:19:17,052 --> 01:19:18,531
I beg your pardon?

914
01:19:18,687 --> 01:19:20,689
Why do you ridicule our work?

915
01:19:20,856 --> 01:19:23,427
Because this show trial
is harmful, disgusting,

916
01:19:23,592 --> 01:19:25,401
and has nothing to do with the law.

917
01:19:27,229 --> 01:19:29,539
Of course, you would think that.

918
01:19:32,568 --> 01:19:34,570
Come on, say it.

919
01:19:34,737 --> 01:19:36,546
You think I was a Nazi, too.

920
01:19:36,705 --> 01:19:38,878
You're convinced of it, aren't you?

921
01:19:38,941 --> 01:19:41,080
For Mr. Radmann, everyone was a Nazi.

922
01:19:41,143 --> 01:19:43,384
Why don't you ask what I did in the war?

923
01:19:43,579 --> 01:19:45,957
I'll tell you if you're interested.

924
01:19:46,115 --> 01:19:48,755
Law studies at Heidelberg, then the Navy,

925
01:19:48,917 --> 01:19:51,625
lieutenant commander, 7th submarine fleet.

926
01:19:51,787 --> 01:19:54,734
After the war,
one year as a French prisoner of war.

927
01:19:54,923 --> 01:19:59,065
Released in August 1946, served with honor.

928
01:19:59,128 --> 01:20:02,769
And by the way,
I was never a member of the Party.

929
01:20:05,134 --> 01:20:07,080
Do you still want to arrest me?

930
01:20:07,236 --> 01:20:10,911
These men must pay for their crimes.
It's a question of justice.

931
01:20:11,073 --> 01:20:13,576
Of course, justice is
your exclusive domain.

932
01:20:13,742 --> 01:20:15,744
Parading around some small fish,

933
01:20:15,944 --> 01:20:18,584
while millions of others
are allowed to carry on.

934
01:20:18,747 --> 01:20:19,953
How is this justice?

935
01:20:20,082 --> 01:20:21,993
Your "small fish" are criminals.

936
01:20:22,151 --> 01:20:24,097
Are you aware of the consequences?

937
01:20:24,253 --> 01:20:28,167
Do you want every young German to ask
if their father was a murderer?

938
01:20:28,324 --> 01:20:30,270
Yes, that's exactly what I want.

939
01:20:30,426 --> 01:20:34,966
I want these lies and this silence to end.

940
01:21:16,472 --> 01:21:20,045
You are Richard Baer,
the last camp commander at Auschwitz.

941
01:21:21,377 --> 01:21:22,822
You're under arrest.

942
01:21:24,313 --> 01:21:25,553
You're under arrest.

943
01:21:25,714 --> 01:21:29,025
You pushed the prisoner's head down
until he drowned.

944
01:21:30,486 --> 01:21:34,866
You forced the group to spend the night
outside the barracks in winter.

945
01:21:35,023 --> 01:21:36,832
Two of them froze to death.

946
01:21:41,497 --> 01:21:42,840
Dr. Berger, come with us.

947
01:21:43,031 --> 01:21:45,910
You were involved
in the transport of prisoners.

948
01:21:53,575 --> 01:21:56,055
You kept kicking him with your boots

949
01:21:56,178 --> 01:21:58,351
until he lay dead on the ground.

950
01:21:59,515 --> 01:22:02,052
You shot the child being
held by its mother.

951
01:22:02,217 --> 01:22:03,423
Both died.

952
01:22:03,585 --> 01:22:04,859
Mr. Rinke.

953
01:22:06,054 --> 01:22:07,533
You're under arrest.

954
01:22:07,689 --> 01:22:10,363
You fed the Zyklon B into the apparatus.

955
01:22:13,228 --> 01:22:17,404
You used the clogs to chase the prisoner
into the electric fence.

956
01:22:22,204 --> 01:22:25,117
That wasn't an order,
it was your own initiative.

957
01:22:27,109 --> 01:22:29,282
Start telling the truth.

958
01:22:41,557 --> 01:22:45,232
The arrests of Richard Baer,
the last Auschwitz camp commander,

959
01:22:45,394 --> 01:22:49,900
and of Robert Mulka are the culmination
of our efforts at redressing these crimes.

960
01:22:50,065 --> 01:22:51,738
Chief Prosecutor, I have a question.

961
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:53,971
- What will the charges be?
- Murder.

962
01:22:54,069 --> 01:22:56,572
Kirsch had a heart attack,
he's in the hospital.

963
01:22:56,772 --> 01:22:58,274
It was very close.

964
01:23:08,250 --> 01:23:10,491
I never said the Kaddish.

965
01:23:13,822 --> 01:23:15,927
What do you mean?

966
01:23:16,091 --> 01:23:18,128
In the camp, God was...

967
01:23:20,295 --> 01:23:21,933
He wasn't there.

968
01:23:22,464 --> 01:23:26,970
When I lay on the floor, waiting for
the ambulance, all I could think of was

969
01:23:28,270 --> 01:23:33,276
that I never said the Kaddish
for Ruth and Klara, my girls.

970
01:23:35,978 --> 01:23:39,289
I won't make it anymore, I can't go there.

971
01:23:45,187 --> 01:23:47,861
Please, you do it for me.

972
01:23:48,524 --> 01:23:50,629
Go to Auschwitz and do this for me.

973
01:23:50,792 --> 01:23:52,328
Say the Kaddish for them.

974
01:23:52,494 --> 01:23:55,134
You'll do that yourself
when you're well again.

975
01:23:55,197 --> 01:23:58,303
Today I cheated death for the second time.

976
01:23:59,301 --> 01:24:00,974
You do it for me.

977
01:24:01,637 --> 01:24:04,174
No, I must conduct this trial first.

978
01:24:06,508 --> 01:24:07,680
Please.

979
01:24:07,809 --> 01:24:09,811
No, Simon, I don't have time for this.

980
01:24:09,878 --> 01:24:11,858
I must conduct this trial.

981
01:24:34,903 --> 01:24:37,509
Johann!

982
01:24:38,106 --> 01:24:39,346
Johann!

983
01:24:40,342 --> 01:24:43,846
- Look, they've abducted Eichmann to Israel.
- What? Incredible.

984
01:24:44,513 --> 01:24:46,550
That is incredible!

985
01:24:48,517 --> 01:24:49,689
Attorney General.

986
01:24:52,354 --> 01:24:54,027
This is great news.

987
01:24:55,223 --> 01:24:57,703
I would have preferred to have him here.

988
01:24:57,859 --> 01:25:01,363
But Bonn refused to file
an extradition request with Israel.

989
01:25:01,530 --> 01:25:05,034
So when will they bring us Mengele,
have they arrested him yet?

990
01:25:05,567 --> 01:25:07,478
He must come straight to Frankfurt.

991
01:25:07,569 --> 01:25:09,606
Mengele has left Argentina.

992
01:25:11,607 --> 01:25:12,881
What? Where is he?

993
01:25:13,041 --> 01:25:15,385
There are rumors he's in Paraguay.

994
01:25:15,544 --> 01:25:17,387
Then the Mossad must get him there.

995
01:25:17,546 --> 01:25:21,392
Please, Mr. Radmann, this isn't
a mail-order catalog to just choose from.

996
01:25:26,555 --> 01:25:28,899
It's a lot more complicated.

997
01:25:47,075 --> 01:25:49,817
You didn't want Eichmann,
so we're doing it.

998
01:25:49,911 --> 01:25:52,755
Good. But you must bring
Mengele to Germany,

999
01:25:52,948 --> 01:25:54,427
then we'll try him here.

1000
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:00,664
Imagine two deer standing in a clearing.

1001
01:26:00,822 --> 01:26:03,428
When you shoot one, the other one's gone.

1002
01:26:03,592 --> 01:26:04,764
What do you mean?

1003
01:26:04,926 --> 01:26:08,100
Mengele is gone.
He's not an issue for us at the moment.

1004
01:26:12,934 --> 01:26:14,106
But you promised...

1005
01:26:14,302 --> 01:26:17,511
Eichmann was always a priority for us.

1006
01:26:17,673 --> 01:26:19,277
For Bauer, too.

1007
01:26:19,941 --> 01:26:21,147
What?

1008
01:26:21,510 --> 01:26:24,514
Eichmann organized the "Final Solution."
Mengele...

1009
01:26:26,148 --> 01:26:28,628
Bring Mengele to Germany, I implore you.

1010
01:26:28,784 --> 01:26:31,958
The UN already gave us a hard time
because of Eichmann.

1011
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:37,035
We're a small country, a young country.
We can't afford to make any more enemies.

1012
01:26:37,192 --> 01:26:39,468
We're already surrounded by enemies.

1013
01:26:43,732 --> 01:26:46,542
Mengele is cunning. He could be anywhere.

1014
01:26:47,369 --> 01:26:49,474
I have to get him in Europe.

1015
01:26:50,505 --> 01:26:52,815
He must travel under a different name.

1016
01:26:52,974 --> 01:26:56,217
Otherwise I would have found him
after Günzburg.

1017
01:26:56,378 --> 01:26:58,551
I need that name, Mr. Fischer.

1018
01:27:00,348 --> 01:27:02,157
I was so close.

1019
01:27:03,185 --> 01:27:05,222
It's not my car's fault.

1020
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:27,448
Hello.

1021
01:27:30,011 --> 01:27:32,218
Kathi, isn't it? Please, have a seat.

1022
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:34,724
I don't have much time,
I have a train to catch.

1023
01:27:34,850 --> 01:27:36,591
Mengele has been to visit.

1024
01:27:36,685 --> 01:27:40,724
I heard his mother tell my boss.
He's flying back from Frankfurt today.

1025
01:27:41,423 --> 01:27:44,563
I wanted to call the police, but my boss...

1026
01:27:46,428 --> 01:27:47,566
Thank you.

1027
01:27:59,541 --> 01:28:01,077
I need to talk to Mr. Fischer.

1028
01:28:01,743 --> 01:28:03,950
Where is he? It's urgent.

1029
01:28:04,112 --> 01:28:06,217
Mr. Fischer has been suspended.

1030
01:28:07,883 --> 01:28:10,796
Your generation has no sense of loyalty.

1031
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:21,803
I need the name Mengele is traveling under.

1032
01:28:21,963 --> 01:28:23,909
Please tell me.

1033
01:28:41,449 --> 01:28:43,793
I warned you. It was leaking oil.

1034
01:28:43,952 --> 01:28:46,091
- Can you fix it?
- The engine's seized.

1035
01:28:46,588 --> 01:28:49,626
We don't even know what name he uses.
Why go to the airport?

1036
01:28:49,691 --> 01:28:52,535
I'll know Mengele when
I see him, believe me.

1037
01:29:00,468 --> 01:29:02,277
Damn it.

1038
01:29:15,884 --> 01:29:17,363
And?

1039
01:29:22,858 --> 01:29:24,303
Mr. Radmann,

1040
01:29:25,126 --> 01:29:26,628
who do you think you are?

1041
01:29:26,795 --> 01:29:28,331
Mr. Wisnievska was very upset.

1042
01:29:28,496 --> 01:29:33,138
I convinced him to testify about his
ordeal at Auschwitz and you stand us up.

1043
01:29:34,703 --> 01:29:36,979
Mr. Langbein, I'm doing what I can.

1044
01:29:50,852 --> 01:29:52,923
What are you doing in Frankfurt, Mother?

1045
01:29:53,021 --> 01:29:55,160
If you don't call me...

1046
01:29:55,357 --> 01:29:58,201
What's going on here,
are you moving offices?

1047
01:29:59,895 --> 01:30:01,499
Son, I need to talk to you.

1048
01:30:01,663 --> 01:30:02,663
I'm busy.

1049
01:30:02,697 --> 01:30:05,405
Don't be stubborn, Johann, it's important.

1050
01:30:06,334 --> 01:30:08,075
Please leave.

1051
01:30:10,505 --> 01:30:13,179
Gustav asked me to marry
him and I said yes.

1052
01:30:13,408 --> 01:30:14,910
You're already married.

1053
01:30:15,543 --> 01:30:17,580
No one comes back after 15 years.

1054
01:30:20,548 --> 01:30:23,358
I've requested that he be declared dead.

1055
01:30:27,889 --> 01:30:29,891
I want you at my wedding.

1056
01:30:30,058 --> 01:30:31,731
But I don't. Gustav was a Nazi.

1057
01:30:31,893 --> 01:30:33,736
How dare you?

1058
01:30:33,895 --> 01:30:37,206
You don't even know him.
Gustav was in the Party. They all were.

1059
01:30:37,365 --> 01:30:38,867
My father wasn't.

1060
01:30:39,034 --> 01:30:40,377
Of course he was!

1061
01:30:41,703 --> 01:30:42,704
What?

1062
01:30:43,238 --> 01:30:46,913
Dad was a member of the Party.
He had no choice, just like Gustav.

1063
01:30:48,276 --> 01:30:51,052
That's enough. You're lying. Get out.

1064
01:30:52,047 --> 01:30:54,618
You sully Dad's honor to
excuse this Gustav! Get out!

1065
01:30:54,783 --> 01:30:56,262
- Be reasonable.
- Get out!

1066
01:31:46,668 --> 01:31:47,669
Dad?

1067
01:32:16,731 --> 01:32:17,971
Don't do it.

1068
01:32:19,134 --> 01:32:21,011
I must know.

1069
01:32:22,003 --> 01:32:23,482
Don't do it.

1070
01:32:24,472 --> 01:32:26,008
Kurt Radmann,

1071
01:32:26,074 --> 01:32:28,714
born in Marburg in 1898.

1072
01:32:31,379 --> 01:32:34,019
Can you find out
if he was a member of the Party?

1073
01:32:45,994 --> 01:32:47,667
Wait in the lobby.

1074
01:33:30,872 --> 01:33:32,442
Marlene.

1075
01:33:32,740 --> 01:33:35,118
Johann, how nice. One second.

1076
01:33:45,553 --> 01:33:46,998
You're drunk.

1077
01:33:47,155 --> 01:33:49,101
How else can you cope?

1078
01:33:50,225 --> 01:33:52,967
I have one drunkard at home,
I don't need another one.

1079
01:33:54,429 --> 01:33:57,467
No, Miss Wondrak
runs with a better crowd now.

1080
01:34:00,135 --> 01:34:02,775
You forgot something there.

1081
01:34:03,938 --> 01:34:05,918
- Where's the swastika?
- What?

1082
01:34:05,974 --> 01:34:08,511
The dress is for the wife
of some Nazi criminal.

1083
01:34:08,776 --> 01:34:10,278
What? Are you crazy?

1084
01:34:10,445 --> 01:34:14,257
Martens, Lichter,
all these fine people are criminals.

1085
01:34:14,349 --> 01:34:15,828
How do I know that?

1086
01:34:15,950 --> 01:34:20,865
Because this is a nation of criminals
and they all act as if nothing happened.

1087
01:34:21,122 --> 01:34:25,434
All these colors.
We Germans should wear black forever.

1088
01:34:26,594 --> 01:34:27,937
Forever and ever.

1089
01:34:28,096 --> 01:34:29,439
And you're making this.

1090
01:34:30,598 --> 01:34:31,838
Careful!

1091
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,480
Are you crazy?
I need to deliver this tomorrow!

1092
01:34:34,636 --> 01:34:38,015
You've become unbearable.
You only see the bad. You're blind.

1093
01:34:38,173 --> 01:34:41,950
- Not everyone is bad!
- I'm blind? It's you who's blind.

1094
01:34:43,678 --> 01:34:46,181
Pioneer Battalion 221.

1095
01:34:47,515 --> 01:34:50,689
Your father was stationed in Poland,
I checked him out.

1096
01:34:50,852 --> 01:34:52,525
Do you know what they did?

1097
01:34:56,124 --> 01:34:58,661
Why don't you ask him why he drinks?

1098
01:35:09,304 --> 01:35:11,306
I don't believe it.

1099
01:35:13,708 --> 01:35:16,985
How dare you do this? Get out! Out!

1100
01:35:18,313 --> 01:35:20,657
I never want to see you again! Out!

1101
01:35:50,078 --> 01:35:51,352
Sheriff Radmann

1102
01:35:51,512 --> 01:35:54,925
and his loyal companion, Chief Sharp Quill.

1103
01:35:56,017 --> 01:36:00,022
They are outnumbered in their fight,
but in the end, the good prevails.

1104
01:36:00,755 --> 01:36:03,759
In the end, the bad guys hang.

1105
01:36:05,059 --> 01:36:07,437
Sheriff Radmann and Chief Sharp...

1106
01:36:16,871 --> 01:36:19,579
- How did you know what it meant?
- What?

1107
01:36:19,741 --> 01:36:22,779
What "shot while trying to escape" means.

1108
01:36:27,949 --> 01:36:30,122
Tell me, how did you know?

1109
01:36:30,585 --> 01:36:31,928
I was there.

1110
01:36:33,888 --> 01:36:35,424
I'm sorry?

1111
01:36:38,226 --> 01:36:40,103
At Auschwitz. I was there.

1112
01:36:48,136 --> 01:36:50,980
You were at Auschwitz? During the war?

1113
01:36:52,940 --> 01:36:54,476
- You're a liar.
- Stop it.

1114
01:36:54,642 --> 01:36:56,747
- You are.
- You don't know what...

1115
01:36:56,911 --> 01:37:00,256
I know way too much.
I know you're a liar and a hypocrite.

1116
01:37:00,415 --> 01:37:01,826
That's the worst of all.

1117
01:37:01,983 --> 01:37:05,089
Have you forgotten who I am, Johann?
Listen to me.

1118
01:37:05,253 --> 01:37:06,994
You want to know what I did?

1119
01:37:07,155 --> 01:37:08,657
I was 17.

1120
01:37:08,823 --> 01:37:12,430
They recruited all the boys in my class
and then sent us to Auschwitz.

1121
01:37:12,593 --> 01:37:15,267
Sure, you just followed orders,
the big excuse.

1122
01:37:15,430 --> 01:37:18,104
And in the end it was all
just Hitler's fault.

1123
01:37:18,966 --> 01:37:22,607
You wanted to know, didn't you?
Now listen to me, damn it!

1124
01:37:32,447 --> 01:37:34,620
We had to watch the inmates.

1125
01:37:35,616 --> 01:37:38,028
There was a Polish professor,

1126
01:37:38,186 --> 01:37:39,961
Tadeusz Rosenthal.

1127
01:37:40,988 --> 01:37:45,630
I secretly slipped him bread and
cigarettes, but then they found it on him.

1128
01:37:45,793 --> 01:37:49,639
To punish him, they stood him
next to the fence and threw his cap over.

1129
01:37:49,797 --> 01:37:52,676
Then they ordered him to fetch it.

1130
01:37:53,134 --> 01:37:55,136
And then they shot him in the back.

1131
01:37:55,803 --> 01:37:59,683
"Shot while trying to escape."
Do you understand, Johann?

1132
01:38:00,708 --> 01:38:03,052
Just like on those lists.

1133
01:38:08,349 --> 01:38:09,828
You disgust me.

1134
01:38:14,489 --> 01:38:16,491
You all disgust me.

1135
01:38:46,921 --> 01:38:48,025
He's drunk.

1136
01:38:48,189 --> 01:38:50,100
What did you do? Were you a Nazi?

1137
01:38:50,258 --> 01:38:52,260
- Were you one of them?
- Idiot!

1138
01:38:54,362 --> 01:38:55,363
You.

1139
01:38:55,863 --> 01:38:58,036
Why didn't you do anything?
Why did you join in?

1140
01:38:58,199 --> 01:38:59,200
Outrageous!

1141
01:38:59,367 --> 01:39:00,778
You bum!

1142
01:39:04,939 --> 01:39:06,782
You were all in on it.

1143
01:39:12,613 --> 01:39:14,388
You were a Nazi.

1144
01:39:14,549 --> 01:39:15,789
You were one...

1145
01:39:47,181 --> 01:39:48,751
Why me?

1146
01:39:51,085 --> 01:39:54,123
- What do you mean?
- This trial. The investigations.

1147
01:39:54,422 --> 01:39:55,799
Why me?

1148
01:39:56,457 --> 01:39:58,835
Because you were born in 1930.

1149
01:39:59,260 --> 01:40:01,604
- You're exonerated.
- No.

1150
01:40:02,163 --> 01:40:04,973
Because I was naive enough
to burn myself out for you.

1151
01:40:05,132 --> 01:40:07,510
By the way, my father was a Nazi, too.

1152
01:40:07,668 --> 01:40:09,511
What did you expect?

1153
01:40:09,604 --> 01:40:12,312
Almost all the lawyers
were members of the Party.

1154
01:40:14,275 --> 01:40:16,482
He was as guilty as the rest of them.

1155
01:40:16,644 --> 01:40:21,787
If you think this is about
who's guilty, partly guilty or innocent,

1156
01:40:21,849 --> 01:40:24,489
then you've learned
nothing, nothing at all.

1157
01:40:35,897 --> 01:40:37,501
I'm resigning.

1158
01:40:41,202 --> 01:40:42,203
Radmann.

1159
01:40:43,538 --> 01:40:45,540
You can't let us down.

1160
01:40:54,815 --> 01:40:56,488
I'm very pleased.

1161
01:40:56,884 --> 01:40:58,989
I think you made the right decision.

1162
01:40:59,854 --> 01:41:01,731
You'll start on Monday.

1163
01:41:22,243 --> 01:41:24,245
I already know.

1164
01:41:26,547 --> 01:41:27,787
Congratulations.

1165
01:41:40,428 --> 01:41:43,534
I wanted to thank you
for all your help, Schmittchen.

1166
01:41:45,700 --> 01:41:47,407
Save your breath.

1167
01:41:55,109 --> 01:41:57,111
Your... Our client is in the wrong.

1168
01:41:57,278 --> 01:41:59,417
He violated patent law. All we can...

1169
01:41:59,580 --> 01:42:04,086
Son, we can't pay for all this
if our clients are in the wrong.

1170
01:42:04,719 --> 01:42:05,925
Come in.

1171
01:42:06,587 --> 01:42:08,089
- Peter.
- Hans. Very good.

1172
01:42:08,289 --> 01:42:09,632
Mr. Lichter, Mr. Radmann.

1173
01:42:10,257 --> 01:42:13,898
I like to consult Mr. Lichter
if it gets a little dirty.

1174
01:42:14,061 --> 01:42:17,440
I'm simply brilliant
and I do anything for our clients. May I?

1175
01:42:17,498 --> 01:42:21,674
Gentlemen, work out a trial strategy.
Money is no object.

1176
01:42:23,971 --> 01:42:26,577
I'm pleased we're working together now.

1177
01:42:29,810 --> 01:42:31,084
Come on.

1178
01:42:32,446 --> 01:42:34,824
Man is not born to be a hero.

1179
01:42:34,982 --> 01:42:36,290
Right?

1180
01:42:47,261 --> 01:42:48,501
Mr. Radmann?

1181
01:43:25,032 --> 01:43:28,639
I was just as blind as everybody else.

1182
01:43:29,503 --> 01:43:31,642
What are you going to do now?

1183
01:43:31,806 --> 01:43:33,479
I don't know.

1184
01:43:36,310 --> 01:43:39,018
But there's one thing I don't get, Simon.

1185
01:43:39,180 --> 01:43:41,160
How can you still live here?

1186
01:43:41,482 --> 01:43:43,860
How can you still live in Germany?

1187
01:43:45,720 --> 01:43:46,892
Look.

1188
01:43:48,856 --> 01:43:52,668
I came from Vienna when I was 18.

1189
01:43:55,563 --> 01:43:57,668
I met my Hannah

1190
01:43:59,667 --> 01:44:03,376
in the hat section
of Schneider's department store.

1191
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:08,684
My children were born
at the university hospital.

1192
01:44:08,843 --> 01:44:12,017
I bought them their first ice cream
in the old town.

1193
01:44:13,180 --> 01:44:16,684
We fed the ducks at the Grueneburgpark.

1194
01:44:16,851 --> 01:44:19,422
One of them pecked Klara on the hand.

1195
01:44:22,022 --> 01:44:23,524
Now tell me.

1196
01:44:25,860 --> 01:44:28,101
Where else do I belong?

1197
01:44:36,036 --> 01:44:38,915
I want to go to Auschwitz
to say the Kaddish.

1198
01:44:41,075 --> 01:44:43,578
I would very much like to do that.

1199
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:48,060
Will you give me the book?

1200
01:44:58,392 --> 01:45:00,303
Gnielka must come with you.

1201
01:45:00,561 --> 01:45:01,904
No, I'll go on my own.

1202
01:45:02,062 --> 01:45:03,598
<i>Bubeleh...</i>

1203
01:45:09,570 --> 01:45:11,106
All right.

1204
01:46:47,568 --> 01:46:50,242
Why did you never talk about it?

1205
01:46:51,338 --> 01:46:53,511
Because I'm ashamed.

1206
01:46:54,541 --> 01:46:58,387
Because I just stood there
and watched, just watched.

1207
01:46:58,846 --> 01:47:00,348
Kept my mouth shut and watched.

1208
01:47:03,617 --> 01:47:05,619
What about the trial?

1209
01:47:05,786 --> 01:47:07,595
How can you give all that up?

1210
01:47:10,024 --> 01:47:13,096
I always wanted to fight
for the good cause.

1211
01:47:13,260 --> 01:47:15,365
But I don't know what that is anymore.

1212
01:47:15,562 --> 01:47:17,371
How can I try another person?

1213
01:47:18,866 --> 01:47:20,573
I had been there...

1214
01:47:27,374 --> 01:47:29,786
I don't know what I would have done.

1215
01:47:29,944 --> 01:47:32,220
You're missing the point, Johann.

1216
01:47:33,213 --> 01:47:35,557
Look around. What do you see?

1217
01:47:38,953 --> 01:47:40,125
Auschwitz.

1218
01:47:40,220 --> 01:47:42,666
No. You see a meadow.

1219
01:47:42,890 --> 01:47:45,734
Trees, barracks, a fence.

1220
01:47:46,226 --> 01:47:49,469
Auschwitz is the stories
that happened here and are buried here.

1221
01:47:49,563 --> 01:47:53,170
Without the trial,
these stories will be forgotten.

1222
01:47:53,467 --> 01:47:56,812
There is no appropriate punishment
for what happened here.

1223
01:47:56,971 --> 01:47:58,746
It's not about punishment.

1224
01:47:58,906 --> 01:48:01,785
It's about the victims,
about their stories.

1225
01:48:23,163 --> 01:48:24,972
What do we do now?

1226
01:48:27,935 --> 01:48:29,972
Simon wrote it down.

1227
01:49:53,387 --> 01:49:55,060
Why have you come back?

1228
01:49:57,524 --> 01:50:01,700
Because the only response to Auschwitz
is to do the right thing yourself.

1229
01:50:17,978 --> 01:50:19,457
Good morning.

1230
01:50:30,124 --> 01:50:31,762
You're back?

1231
01:50:34,895 --> 01:50:35,965
I'm sorry.

1232
01:50:36,130 --> 01:50:37,609
Forget it.

1233
01:50:37,798 --> 01:50:39,402
Nobody's perfect.

1234
01:50:39,600 --> 01:50:41,477
Apart from myself.

1235
01:50:55,449 --> 01:51:00,023
Thank you. Goodbye.
I will get it on Monday then.

1236
01:51:00,988 --> 01:51:03,264
Hello. Can I help you?

1237
01:51:03,423 --> 01:51:05,334
I have a repair job.

1238
01:51:05,926 --> 01:51:07,769
I'll deal with this customer.

1239
01:51:10,931 --> 01:51:12,171
How can I help?

1240
01:51:16,470 --> 01:51:19,007
Can this be patched up?

1241
01:51:21,341 --> 01:51:22,843
It's completely torn.

1242
01:51:23,010 --> 01:51:24,512
I know.

1243
01:51:26,113 --> 01:51:28,457
But it means the world to me.

1244
01:51:34,288 --> 01:51:37,462
No, the tear is too big.

1245
01:51:38,625 --> 01:51:40,366
It can't be saved.

1246
01:51:41,862 --> 01:51:44,172
I will spare no expense, whatever it takes.

1247
01:51:54,675 --> 01:51:57,155
Get yourself a new one.

1248
01:51:57,211 --> 01:51:59,657
And then take better care of it.

1249
01:52:05,352 --> 01:52:07,696
I guess I'll have to live with that.

1250
01:52:08,989 --> 01:52:10,866
Yes, you'll have to.

1251
01:52:48,228 --> 01:52:51,732
This is the life.
Good friends, cake and champagne.

1252
01:52:51,898 --> 01:52:53,878
What more could you want?

1253
01:52:57,537 --> 01:53:00,074
I didn't bring
my mom's cake back just for you.

1254
01:53:00,240 --> 01:53:02,743
Let the boy eat, he's still growing.

1255
01:53:11,385 --> 01:53:14,628
The trial date is set.
To the Prosecutor's Office, Frankfurt!

1256
01:53:14,788 --> 01:53:16,563
And to you, Johann.

1257
01:53:19,793 --> 01:53:21,295
<i>L'chaim.</i>

1258
01:53:22,229 --> 01:53:23,264
To life!

1259
01:53:23,430 --> 01:53:24,773
<i>L'chaim.</i>

1260
01:53:24,931 --> 01:53:26,239
To life!

1261
01:53:31,238 --> 01:53:32,581
That's all.

1262
01:53:39,579 --> 01:53:40,819
Johann.

1263
01:53:51,325 --> 01:53:53,271
I've brought your jacket.

1264
01:53:53,994 --> 01:53:56,270
I thought the tear couldn't be fixed.

1265
01:54:01,935 --> 01:54:03,676
It's not completely fixed.

1266
01:54:07,641 --> 01:54:09,621
The trial starts tomorrow.

1267
01:54:09,776 --> 01:54:11,949
I know. Good luck.

1268
01:54:42,142 --> 01:54:45,521
You'll give testimony on Friday.
Are you ready?

1269
01:54:46,513 --> 01:54:48,015
Greenhorn,

1270
01:54:49,483 --> 01:54:51,656
I've been ready for 20 years.

1271
01:55:10,504 --> 01:55:11,847
I'll go in now.

1272
01:55:19,246 --> 01:55:22,523
Gentlemen, today history is made.

1273
01:55:29,222 --> 01:55:31,065
I'm proud of you.

1274
01:56:03,457 --> 01:56:08,907
I declare the Jury Court
in Frankfurt now in session.

1275
01:56:11,465 --> 01:56:14,344
The Auschwitz trial started in 1963.

1276
01:56:14,434 --> 01:56:19,645
211 survivors of the concentration
and extermination camp gave testimony.

1277
01:56:20,574 --> 01:56:23,680
19 SS men who had sewed at Auschwitz
were charged

1278
01:56:23,777 --> 01:56:28,021
in the largest trial in the history
of the Federal Republic of Germany.

1279
01:56:29,115 --> 01:56:31,618
17 of them were found guilty.

1280
01:56:31,685 --> 01:56:37,294
Throughout the 20-month trial,
none of the defendants showed any remorse.
