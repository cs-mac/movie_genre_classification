All right, darlin',
I'm so glad to see you.

00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:23,242
You can read that book when we get home.
Come on, girl.

Sure, we're on tough
times here in Minden.

Tough times! That's right!

8
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:47,406
We are in such tough times I can say:

9
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:50,910
You know, I remember that song
<i>Things Aren't the Way They Used to Be.</i>

10
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:55,744
Well, ladies and gentlemen, things
aren't the way they used to be,

11
00:01:55,815 --> 00:02:00,184
and I got something to tell you. They
might never get back to where they were!

you do have. Hallelujah!

Team not lookin' that good this year.
Do they, Curtis?

26
00:02:58,244 --> 00:03:01,441
Heck, they ain't looked
good in the last 25 years.

27
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:05,610
Damn! I ain't need no lemon!
Look at it, look it.

One more cherry,
I'd have won this thing.

29
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:11,257
Are we playing a game
here or what, man?

30
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:15,784
I'm playin'! You hold it up,
pick 'em up. Thank you.

31
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:19,389
That mean a double. Double trouble.
In the bubble. Here we go.

Pow! Look out there, double four!

Hey, Curtis!

00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:25,835
Hey.

35
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,435
Man, you took your break
late today, huh?

36
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:32,103
Mm-mmm. Worked through it
so I can get to practice.

37
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:35,944
You know, if you want to help,
I can put in a word with coach.

38
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:39,280
I'm busy. Got too much on my plate.

39

- I don't have time, man. My first day.

42
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:51,930
Hey, why don't you come by this week
and get a real meal?

00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:53,863
- Who's cookin'?
- Val.

Sweetie, listen, I had to pick up
longer hours at the diner.

63
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:33,195
- I'm not gonna get home till late.
- So?

00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:36,394
- I don't want you here alone.
- But I can take care of myself.

00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:40,303
Honey, there are plenty of after-school
activities you could be doing.

66
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:42,568
- Like what?
- I don't know! Like drama.

67
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:47,375
Dance. Something.
Listen, I need for you to try.

About yesterday... I am really sorry.

72
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:09,267
I just got confused. I thought it
was yesterday, but we're going today.

73
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:13,533
So a bunch of us are hanging out
over there. You should come.

You comin'?

75
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:26,718
You crazy? I ain't tryin'
to think about that stuff.

76
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:30,278
- Yo, what's up?
- So, Jasmine,

77
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:34,588
we seem to have a little problem
with the girls' bathroom.

78
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:38,528
Uh, the toilets are clogged,
and since your name is Plummer and all,

79
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:42,796
we figured you'd
be the one to unclog them.

[all laughing]

81

hope there's no dookey in it.

Everyone hates me.

87
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,912
They think I'm an idiot.
Can I just stay home, please?

88
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:08,154
Please, Ma? I can take care of myself.

89
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:16,034
- Claire, I ain't seen him. OK?
- [scoffs]

90
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:19,196
So if you lookin' for that
child support or whatever,

91
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:23,971
- he don't contact me no more either.
- This is not about your brother.

92
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:27,809
- It's about your niece, Jasmine.
- What's wrong with her?

93
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,906
Curtis, I need somebody
to hang out with her in the afternoon

94
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:33,884
- until I get my hours changed.
- I ain't no babysitter!

95
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,148
Come on, you've been out of work
for months.

96
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:40,249
I know you don't expect me to
walk around here with some little girl.

97
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:43,818
I don't even like kids
and you know that.

98
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:47,992
Well, find somebody else.

99
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:51,298
So, what, you just gonna
walk away from me, Curtis?

100
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:53,596
Huh?

101
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:58,906
When your mama didn't have no place
to go, remember who took care of her?

102
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:04,649
You playin' dirty pool, Claire.

103
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:09,182
Bring my mama in this,
that ain't even fair.

104
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:10,244
[sighs]

105
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:14,692
Curtis, listen, man, all I'm asking you
to do is to pick her up from school,

106
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:18,355
keep an eye on her.
Just until I get home.

107
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,160
It's just a few hours a day.

108
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:25,763
- I give you five dollars an hour?
- Five dollars?

109
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:33,176
Just pick her up
from the school at 3:00.

110
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:37,243
Curtis, I don't have nowhere else to go.

111
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,425
Hey, girl.

112
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:57,868
Hey!

113
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,205
Hey!

114
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:05,635
So you gonna talk to me or what?

115
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,202
What you readin', anyway?
What does it say?

116
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,681
<i>- "Ma-geeky"?</i>
- It's a book,

117
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,617
and it's not <i>"Ma-geeky",</i>
it's <i>Magique.</i>

118
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:16,280
It's about a boy who
becomes a magical warrior,

119
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:19,722
so, if you don't mind,
I'm trying to read.

120
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:22,022
Hey, don't be getting smart now.

121
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:25,689
I'm only doing this for your mama.
All right?

122
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:28,700
I don't take no lip
from no little girls neither.

123
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:32,795
- 'Cause I got better things to do.
- Then go do 'em.

124
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:37,334
Where you? Jasmine!

125
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,868
Hey! Hey, girl! Jasmine!

126
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:47,245
Ain't worth no damn five dollars!
Hey, Jasmine! Come here!

127
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,584

[keys jingle, door opens]

129
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:58,455
- [Claire] Hey!
- Hey.

130
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:03,260
- So how did it go?
- All right.

131
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,362
So where's Jas?

132
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,700
- I don't know.
- [door opens]

133
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,436
- Jas?
- Hey, Mom.

134
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,843
Hey! So, did you have fun
with your Uncle Curtis?

135
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:17,348
Tons. What's for dinner?

136
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,219
- You didn't eat yet?
- No.

137
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,655
You didn't feed her?

138
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:29,786
You told me to watch her. You
didn't say nothing about feeding her.

139
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:32,228
That's because I thought
you had common sense.

140
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,789
Get somebody with
some common sense, all right?

141
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:38,428
'Cause I ain't got enough to deal
with that little girl. OK?

142
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:43,999
Get somebody else 'cause, to be honest,
she too weird and moody for me.

143
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:47,239
Curtis, she's not weird. She's shy.

144
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:50,282
She's still waiting
on her no-good daddy to show up.

145
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:53,011
She's wearing his watch 24 hours a day.

146
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,951
It wouldn't hurt you if you would
just be a little encouraging to her.

147
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:00,959
I ain't got no encouragement. None!

148
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:06,290
Go get Dr. Phil
or the Dog Whisperer or somebody.

149
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:10,631
- Not Curtis Plummer.
- Can you finish out the week?

150
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:12,068
Can I at least get paid?

151
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:15,806
You owe me 25 dollars.

152
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,503
Can you at least
feed her the next time?

153
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:25,279
So, what you gonna want to eat? Hmm?

154
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:28,843
For dinner? What you like?

155
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:32,916
Grilled cheese sandwiches? Huh?

156
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,087
What, you still not talking to me?

157
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:42,366
Why do you want to talk to me?
I'm too weird and moody.

158
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:45,727
You know I didn't mean that.

159
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,800
All right, I don't think you're weird.

160
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,975
I said I'm sorry.

161
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:58,647
All right, fine, we ain't gotta talk.

162
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:06,088
Why you carry that stupid football
around all the time?

163
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:10,185
- I don't carry this all the time.
- Yeah, you do.

164
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:12,253
So?

165
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:16,427
So... you're a grown man
carrying around a football.

166
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:19,232
Don't you think that's weird?

167
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:22,970
Not really.

168
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:28,876
And you stink, too. Always wearing
those same old dirty clothes.

169
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:32,042
Don't you know how to do laundry?
You should be embarrassed.

170
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,383
I'm embarrassed to even be with you.

171
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:39,857
You know what? Five dollars a hour ain't
worth dealing with a attitude like that!

172
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:42,689
Then don't. It's not
like I want you around anyway.

173
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:47,893
- It's not like I want to be around!
- Don't be! I don't need you!

174
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:52,563
Apparently, you do need me.
That's what your mama think.

175
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:56,574
Now I'm stuck with you! That's
'cause your father didn't want to be.

176
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:10,219
Man... Sorry! God!

177
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,985
Hey, Jasmine,
I didn't mean it like that!

178
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:15,950
Hey, slow down!

179
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:39,513
- Who are you here for?
- Hmm?

180
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:41,280
Who are you here for?

181
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:44,322
- Jasmine Plummer.
- Oh, great! Come right on in.

182
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,998
OK, class.

183
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,861
I would like to...

184
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:59,632
I would like to introduce Mr. Plummer.

185
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,299
What are you doing?

186
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:06,208
Would you like to come up here
and tell the kids what you do?

187
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,874
Oh, wait a minute. Hold on.

188
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:15,511
- Um, I'm her uncle, not her daddy.
- Oh.

189
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:20,992
It's OK. Nuclear family,
extended family. It's all family.

190
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,621
So would you still like to talk
to the kids, tell them what you do?

191
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,531
- Yeah, I can talk to them.
- OK.

192
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:29,966
Hold that.

193
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:33,402
- [kids giggling]
- OK.

194
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:35,372
- How y'all doin'?
- [all] Fine.

195
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:36,840
Um...

196
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:40,470
I do all kinda, like,
entrepreneurial endeavors.

197
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:44,848
Um... You know those
nutritional supplements?

198
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:46,179
OK.

199
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:48,743
- Yeah, I used to sell those.
- [kids snickering]

200
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:52,655
And, um, you know, I had people
all over the world, really,

201
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:56,991
all kinds of geographical locations.
I had a salesmen who, um,

202
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,758
would participate in network marketing.

203
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:01,265
[boy] Don't listen to him.

204
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,733
He tried to get my dad
to sell those vitamins.

205
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:07,431
- He said it's a pyramid scheme.
- It's not a pyramid scheme!

206
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:11,272
It's a, uh, multilevel, uh,
business opportunity.

207
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:13,311
That's a scam!
You're a scam artist!

208
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:15,506
- Your daddy's a punk.
- You a punk!

209
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:19,847
OK, Javy. Mr. Plummer. Can we say thank
you to Mr. Plummer, please? Class!

210
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,648
[all] Thank you, Mr. Plummer.

211
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,713
Thank you so much, Mr. Plummer,
for taking out the time with the kids.

212
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,691
[Curtis] I'm gonna see you
outside, Jasmine.

213
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,126
OK. Yeah, let's just...

214
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:35,394
You need to give him a F.

215
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:40,166
- I'll see you outside too.
- Thank you, Mr. Plummer.

216
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:41,866
Thank you, Mr. Plummer.

217
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,910
[kids snickering, whispering]

218
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,981
Jasmine! Jasmine!

219
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:05,821
Know what? I'm gonna meet you
down the block next time.

220
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:08,264
I ain't going nowhere near that school.

221
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:10,802
I didn't tell you to come
in the first place.

222
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:14,771
You're using them big words,
trying to make yourself sound important.

223
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:19,903
Mr. Entrepreneur. How come you
couldn't just say you were unemployed?

224
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,241
Why you didn't tell 'em?

225
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:25,309
I don't think my mom'd be cool
with me hanging out here.

226
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:29,787
I know she not gonna want you here.
That's why you ain't gonna tell her.

227
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:32,050
Curtis! Throw the ball here, boy!

228
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:35,287
Do you mind if I throw the ball
with the reverend a little bit?

229
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,053
Ah!

230
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:40,762
Knock yourself out.

231
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:45,236
So when am I gonna see
you back in church, boy?

232
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:48,762
I don't know, reverend.
I've been kinda preoccupied lately.

233
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,605
Preoccupied since your mama died.

234
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:55,135
It's been two years, Curtis.

235
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:57,614
It is time to move on, son.

236
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,481
Hey. Go long, brotha.

237
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:03,385
All right. Hit me.

238
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:04,820
Hit me, hit...

239
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:07,484
Oops.

240
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:12,927
Hey, girl.

241
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:15,524
Jasmine!

242
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,637
Jasmine, pick up that ball.

243
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,985
You ever play sports in school?

244
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,827
No, I don't like sports.

245
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:50,862
What do you mean,
you don't like sports?

246
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:55,771
- I want to be a model.
- A model?

247
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:57,866
[laughs]

248
00:17:57,943 --> 00:18:02,346
For real? You don't even
look like the model type.

249
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:06,180
- What, I'm ugly?
- No.

250
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,549
I didn't say you was ugly, did I?

251
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,680
Just you always got your nose
in a book or something.

252
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:15,523
I thought you wanted to be something
a little more intellectual.

253
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:18,529
<i>Next makeover candidate</i>
<i>deserves to feel like a queen.</i>

254
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:22,556
So you ain't never
threw the football before today?

255
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:26,593
No, now leave me alone.
I'm trying to watch <i>Tyra.</i>

256
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:30,540
It's hard to believe, though.
You throw pretty good.

257
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:33,311
Shh!

258
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:36,438
<i>Here is what Francesca looks like.</i>
<i>Come on out, goddess!</i>

259
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:39,416
[Curtis] Is this a <i>Tyra</i> marathon
or somethin'?

260
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:43,683
You know, might as well just go on
outside and throw the football around

261
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:48,089
- a little before your mama come back.
- Shh!

262
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,028
All right. I'm shhh, shhh, shhh.

263
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:55,696
- You're not gonna shut up, are you?
- Nope.

264
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:01,935
Here we go! Here we go!
Here we go, go, go! Come on.

265
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:05,342
Hey, you kinda slow.

266
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,605
You gotta put a little pep in that.

267
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:12,082
Right here you go, hit me with your
best shot. Come on, girl. Right here!

268
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:14,082
Right here.

269
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:18,047
No!

270
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:24,360
Throw it like you did at the park.
With a little more oomph on it.

271
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:27,522
Right here.

272
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:29,595
Ha!

273
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:31,967
That was better.

274
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:34,665
But look, when you throw the ball,

275
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,538
first of all,
you got to have your feet apart.

276
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:38,633
What are you doing?

277
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:42,111
Look, you cannot stand like this
and throw the ball.

278
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:45,548
You have to be sideways,
point it, deliver.

279
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:47,175
You really stink.

280
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:52,317
- Do you know what a down and out is?
- You.

281
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,528
Funny.

282
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:59,120
Go ten spaces... bam.

283
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:04,101
Go out, hit me with the ball before I
turn out. Right in the hands. All right?

284
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:05,295
Come on, call it out.

285
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,134
- What?
- Let's go!

286
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,175
Gotta call it out.

287
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:14,508
"Hut, hut, hike." You know, like
quarterbacks do. Come on, hit me.

288
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,980
- Hut, hut, hike.
- Better than that.

289
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,415
- Hut, hut, hike!
- There we go. Come on!

290
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:22,713
Hit me! Hit me!

291
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:24,281
Ooh!

292
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:26,119
- Yeah!
- [door creaks]

293
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:28,455
Hey, Jasmine!

294
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,969
"The family was important
in New England.

295
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:15,939
Puritan children, like their parents,
had to work hard

296
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:18,340
and follow strict ideas of discipline.

297
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:36,092
Still, many families were close
and devoted to each other.

298
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:39,028
Even the chores and religious duties..."

299
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:46,969
You like throwing the football?

300
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,734
Yeah, it's cool.

301
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:54,005
Want to learn how to throw
like a real quarterback?

302
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:56,138
- [whistle blows]
- Sure.

303
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:01,744
First thing I'm gonna do
is show you how to grip this football.

304
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,721
See these laces here?
You gotta get your fingers on them.

305
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:07,850
That gives the ball the spiral.
That makes it spin.

306
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:12,354
All right, you grab it. Find your grip.

307
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:14,831
Give it to me.

308
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:18,392
- That's how fast you gotta get.
- OK, throw it to me.

309
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,459
Now, you grab it.

310
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:21,330
- Got it?
- Got it.

311
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:22,737
- Like it?
- Like it.

312
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:24,799
That's how you hold the ball.
That's your grip.

313
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:28,073
Mr. Peppers, you got any
of that field paint around here?

314
00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:31,081
Yeah, I think there's some
in that back room there.

315
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:35,279
- Look under the dresser.
- Oh. Ah.

316
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:37,685
Got it. Thanks,
I'll bring it right back.

317
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:46,226
OK. Those your lines right here. I want
you to keep your foot in here, right?

318
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:49,756
See where my foot is starting?
Step out, bam, put it back.

319
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:52,895
Step out, bam, put it back.
Step out, bam, put it back.

320
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:54,302
Bam, put it back.

321
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:57,603
Good. Pretty good, you'll get better,
you'll get better.

322
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,768
Let's go throw some passes.

323
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,937
Step into it.

324
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:05,678
Give it to me. Deliver the ball.

325
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:10,211
Come on, deliver right here, to my
hands. Not here, not there, right here.

326
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:13,655
Step into it, remember
everything I told you, deliver.

327
00:23:15,293 --> 00:23:17,227
Damn, girl!

328
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:19,126
Girl, you got a arm on you.

329
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:32,438
Can't we just toss it around
like we did yesterday?

330
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:34,274
No! That's boring.

331
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:36,974
- [sighs]
- Look, you wanna be a quarterback,

332
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:39,516
you gotta learn how
to hit multiple receivers.

333
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:43,315
Right here,
receiver number one: Beyoncé.

334
00:23:43,388 --> 00:23:48,052
Over here, receiver number two:
Foxy Brown.

335
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:53,029
And my personal favorite,
receiver number three: Tyra Banks.

336
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,896
Don't forget
what I told you, set your feet.

337
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:59,425
Do it like we said, all right? Ready?

338
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:02,803
- Ready.
- OK. Load up. Load up.

339
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:04,705
Hit Beyoncé.

340
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:06,535
Bam!

341
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:10,248
That's what I'm talkin' about.
That's what I'm talkin' about.

342
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:13,284
All right, one more time.
Here we go. One more time. Come on.

343
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:15,342
Load up, load up.
Get ready, get ready.

344
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,285
Foxy Brown, hit her, hit her.

345
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:20,957
- Ouch!
- Whoo! Whoo!

346
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:24,359
- Man, right on.
- That girl's a phenom!

347
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:28,229
That's what I'm talkin' about.
Come on, load up, load up, load up.

348
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,666
Tyra. Hit her! Hit her.

349
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,795
- [gasps]
- [cheering]

350
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:35,430
Slayed that thing, girl!

351
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:37,441
I'm gonna go out for a pass, all right?

352
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:40,103
You gotta learn how
to hit a moving target, OK?

353
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:43,238
You ready to hit me now, all right?
Gotta go!

354
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:46,983
Beyoncé!

355
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,215
Whoo! Yeah!

356
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:52,915
That was sweet!

357
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:55,687
Curtis got himself
a pro player out there now!

358
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:00,197
That girl throw that ball! That's what
I'm talkin' about now, that's football.

359
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:02,961
- That's football!
- [Curtis] You're good, girl!

360
00:25:03,034 --> 00:25:06,197
You might be my niece after all.

361
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:08,898
So how have things
with Curtis and Jas been going?

362
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:12,239
Everything seems OK. I think they just
sit around and read books.

363
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:14,244
[both belch]

364
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:25,587
Man! I can't believe you live
in this place. It's so messy.

365
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:35,355
Is that my book? Man, I been
lookin' all over for this thing.

366
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:37,298
What's it doin' here?

367
00:25:39,337 --> 00:25:43,205
- Have you been reading this?
- Yeah.

368
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:48,612
I saw how much you was into it,
so I just gave it a shot.

369
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:55,018
- And?
- It's good. I like it.

370
00:25:56,755 --> 00:25:57,915
It's a good book.

371
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:04,254
Well, I read it two times.
You can have it.

372
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:08,656
Is this your yearbook?

373
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:10,859
Mm-hmm.

374
00:26:11,636 --> 00:26:13,467
Don't laugh.

375
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:18,334
[Jasmine laughs]

376
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:21,607
Is this you?
Man, you look so funny.

377
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:27,851
That's me,
and then that's your daddy.

378
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:37,122
All right, let's just close that.

379
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:40,589
I'll show you later.

380
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:45,329
[exhales]

381
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:48,098
I should be getting you home.

382
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:52,132
OK.

383
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:56,010
No! No, you don't throw the ball!

384
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:59,539
It's an option play, right?
Option means you keep the ball

385
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:02,951
or you run with the ball
or you pitch the ball.

386
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:06,149
The man's shoulders are up-field,
what do you do?

387
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:08,556
Yes, go, do it again!

388
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:11,926
- Honest to God!
- [boy] Hut, hut!

389
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:14,397
- [whistle blows]
- [boys grunting]

390
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:18,527
This is where you're supposed to pitch
the football! What is hard about that?

391
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:22,733
You know what, guys? I would like
to win one football game, just one!

392
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:25,605
But we can't win a game
if we can't pitch a football!

393
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:28,373
- No way!
- Why not?

394
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:32,849
'Cause I'm a girl,
and girls don't play football.

395
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:37,513
What you think we been doing for
the last couple of weeks, crocheting?

396
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:41,855
It's just you and me having fun
so we don't die of boredom.

397
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:45,555
It doesn't mean I want to try out
for some stupid football team.

398
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:47,723
But you're good at it.

399
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:51,758
Right? Now, you owe it to yourself if
you're good at something to pursue it.

400
00:27:58,643 --> 00:28:01,908
Let me show you somethin'.
Come on, let me show you somethin'.

401
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:06,110
These my conference MVP medals,

402
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,709
three years in a row.

403
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:14,152
These are cool.

404
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:18,389
Just picture a whole stadium
full of people cheering for you.

405
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:23,765
I just think it would be weird playing
football with a bunch of boys.

406
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:27,771
Look at Oprah...
being all rich and powerful.

407
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,807
You think she care about
the fact that she's not a guy?

408
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:34,106
But...

409
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:36,909
...I can't play football and be a model.

410
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:40,542
Yes, you can. I mean, look, Tyra Banks.

411
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:44,954
She's a model, talk-show host...

412
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,018
She even did a album.

413
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:51,324
Can't even sing, but she did it anyway.

414
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:55,093
I mean, you can do what you want to do.
I'll make you a deal.

415
00:28:57,702 --> 00:29:02,503
Try out for the team,
just to see how you like it...

416
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:06,476
...and I'll buy you some more
of those fashion magazines you like.

417
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:13,608
How about this:

418
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:17,519
If I go out for the football team,

419
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:20,786
you ask Ms. Macer out on a date.

420
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:22,690
Your teacher?

421
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:27,164
I saw the way she looked
at you in the classroom.

422
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:29,257
All right.

423
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:31,165
All right, I'll ask her.

424
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:35,134
But when you try out for the team,

425
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:39,040
all this "I'm a girl" stuff,
you throw that out the window.

426
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,704
'Cause when you hit the field,
you're not a girl.

427
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,272
You're a football player.

428
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:47,778
[coach] Huddle it up, let's go!

429
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:52,118
[boy] All right, come on, huddle it up!
Come on, no playing around, hurry up!

430
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,317
- [boy 2] Blue 22, blue 22!
- [boy] Go long!

431
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:57,156
- Hut, hut!
- [all groaning]

432
00:29:57,228 --> 00:30:00,391
Chrissakes, Feather, you're
not hikin' the ball to Yao Ming!

433
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:03,400
- Sorry.
- Turn around, let's go!

434
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:06,904
I think this team
is worse than last year's team.

435
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:10,031
We only won two games last year.

436
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:11,973
Hey, coach.

437
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:15,245
Curtis Plummer. Been a while.

438
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:18,407
- How's the team?
- Ah, not quite there yet.

439
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:22,544
What she supposed to be doin' here?
She tryin' out for cheerleader?

440
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,020
Yo, dookey girl!

441
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:29,085
I might have somethin'
that'll help get you there.

442
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:33,290
I wish.
You're a little too old, Curtis.

443
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:38,199
Not me, my niece. Jasmine, step up.

444
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:40,100
- Hi.
- Hi.

445
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:44,002
She's a girl. This is a boys' league.

446
00:30:44,075 --> 00:30:47,203
- Says who?
- Says everybody.

447
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:51,476
- What position does she play?
- She's a quarterback.

448
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:55,246
- She's a quarterback?
- We got a quarterback.

449
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,651
Javy Hall.

450
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:01,088
Come on!

451
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:04,026
What the hell?!
Are you kidding me?

452
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:07,660
He's pretty talented.

453
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:11,158
[clears throat] Curtis.

454
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:16,029
You know what? He's getting better.

455
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:20,936
You want to let your niece get
all busted up 'cause what?

456
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:23,412
You want to relive your glory days?

457
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:25,608
Come on, Curtis.

458
00:31:25,683 --> 00:31:27,844
I got a team to coach.

459
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,512
Do it again!

460
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:34,289
Jasmine.

461
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:38,788
- Where you goin'?
- I told you they wouldn't want me.

462
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:42,760
They gonna want you.

463
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:47,100
What I want you to do is give me
a three-step drop and hit me with it.

464
00:31:47,171 --> 00:31:49,731
Come on, three-step drop, come on.

465
00:31:59,784 --> 00:32:02,275
Go! Go.

466
00:32:03,621 --> 00:32:06,488
You gotta be kidding me!
Get the ball in your hands...

467
00:32:06,557 --> 00:32:08,525
All right, here we go, they lookin'.

468
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:11,687
[coach] Guys, it's a simple pass play!
OK, line it up.

469
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:13,128
Whoo!

470
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:17,266
Coach.

471
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:27,407
[Curtis] That's sweet!

472
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:33,443
Hmm.

473
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:39,183
All right, Manny, right side, let's go.

474
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:42,249
OK, we're gonna run a ten and in,
all right?

475
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:46,856
Relax, stay loose.

476
00:32:46,931 --> 00:32:49,866
- Three-step drop. Deliver the ball.
- [coach] OK, let's do this.

477
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:51,162
What's your problem?

478
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:53,897
I'm not letting her put
hands under my King Kongs.

479
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:56,566
- Your what?
- My King Kongs, the magic?

480
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:59,269
- She's not touchin' it.
- You mean Ping-Pongs?

481
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:02,006
Stop cryin' and hike the damn ball!
Let's go!

482
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,547
Hut, hut!

483
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:06,009
[all laughing]

484
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:08,211
[whistle blows]

485
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:09,583
[coach] Hey! Hey!

486
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,281
- That's OK, Jasmine.
- Zip it!

487
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:14,154
- Do it again.
- Secure the ball, OK?

488
00:33:14,225 --> 00:33:17,126
Secure the ball.

489
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:18,890
Comfortable.

490
00:33:18,963 --> 00:33:20,590
Hut, hut!

491
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:30,034
Someone's been teachin'
somebody some football.

492
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:32,636
Good job!

493
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:35,573
Let's do a buttonhook.

494
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:39,308
Beyoncé, buttonhook.

495
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:43,809
Hut, hut!

496
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:54,655
Who's laughing now?

497
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,234
- [coach] Go again. Let's go long.
- Hut, hut!

498
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:14,013
Very nice. All right, that's enough.

499
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:16,986
Let's go, guys, suit up, let's go.

500
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:20,590
She's got an arm, no question.

501
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:25,226
- Ball handling's kinda weak.
- I'll work with her.

502
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:29,357
She'll be better
than half the guys out here.

503
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:31,265
All right.

504
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:34,600
Thanks, coach, I appreciate it.
I know you didn't have to do that.

505
00:34:34,672 --> 00:34:37,300
Hey, hey, hey, hey. You made it.

506
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:39,707
You on the team.

507
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:42,337
You on the team!

508
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:46,474
What I tell you?
I knew you could do it.

509
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:50,783
- Curtis, are you crazy?
- But, Mom, I am pretty good,

510
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:54,188
and you did say you wanted me
to do some after-school activity.

511
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,658
You said something
about after school!

512
00:34:56,727 --> 00:34:59,321
Honey, are you serious?

513
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:01,024
Do you really want to do this?

514
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:05,092
Don't you think
I should at least... try?

515
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:10,302
<i>- [Javy] # Yeah, come on, y'all</i>
<i>- [boy] # Yeah</i>

516
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:12,843
# <i>Bring it, bring it</i>
<i>Bring it down now</i>

517
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,104
[boy 2] Whoo!

518
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:16,377
<i>[Javy]</i> # <i>Come on, yeah</i>

523
00:35:28,826 --> 00:35:32,557
- You nervous?
- No, I'm all right.

524
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,790
[boys chanting]

525
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:35,355
Go in here.

526
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:40,897
Let's go.

527
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:48,172
OK.

528
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:50,441
Let's see... get this.

529
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:53,539
Uh...

530
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:57,387
There, that's good. There you go.

531
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:01,950
- Be all right?
- Mmm... yeah.

532
00:36:02,026 --> 00:36:06,292
- OK. Uh, get your jersey.
- Coach...

533
00:36:08,032 --> 00:36:09,556
Um...

534
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:12,327
Can I have number 11?

535
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:16,272
I'll have a look.

536
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:26,742
[grunts]

537
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:29,817
[grunts]

538
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:40,691
[grunts]

539
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:44,300
Come on. Whoo!

540
00:36:50,508 --> 00:36:51,497
Eww!

541
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:56,773
OK.

542
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:17,100
Oh! Oh-oh!

543
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:22,205
Lookin' good there.
Don't jinx my old number now.

544
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:24,764
Come on, hustle up, let's go.

545
00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:29,242
[Javy] Blue 42, hut, hut!

546
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:31,709
[boy] Pass, pass.

547
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:34,279
[boy 2] Damon!

548
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:36,377
Gotta put that in his hands.

549
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:40,015
C, man, why don't you
come down here and join us?

550
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:43,322
I'm cool. When's Jasmine
gonna get some practice time?

551
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:45,362
Yeah! What you scared of?

552
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:48,398
She gonna make your boys
look like a bunch of pansies?

553
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,724
Dive, dive!

554
00:37:50,801 --> 00:37:53,793
- Ha! Too late for that.
- Mm-hmm.

555
00:37:53,871 --> 00:37:55,668
I'll do my best.

556
00:37:56,674 --> 00:37:58,369
One more time.

557
00:37:59,143 --> 00:38:01,737
Curtis is...

558
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:03,040
Watch the blitz!

559
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,378
- Go, come on.
- Go to line.

560
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:06,746
Cover two.

561
00:38:06,817 --> 00:38:09,547
- Coach!
- Move. Game two.

562
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:15,617
Javy! Bring it in.

563
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:17,593
Come on! Hustle up!

564
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,789
- [whistle blows]
- All right.

565
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:26,828
Let the backup run a few plays.

566
00:38:26,904 --> 00:38:28,599
Plummer.

567
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:33,642
You'll run a double-twin,
wide triangle.

568
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:37,613
Basically, you look for Damon
over the middle. Ten yards. OK?

569
00:38:37,682 --> 00:38:41,743
He's gonna cut down the middle. Go.
Hustle, get in there. Take control.

570
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:50,324
OK, so we're gonna go to double-twins,
wide-end triangle. Got it?

571
00:38:50,394 --> 00:38:52,225
- This is a joke.
- No way.

572
00:38:52,296 --> 00:38:54,730
Ready? Break.

573
00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:57,859
- [chatter]
- Shh! Shh!

574
00:39:00,538 --> 00:39:02,335
[boy] Watch the ends!

575
00:39:03,874 --> 00:39:07,071
Brown 19! Brown 19!

576
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:08,202
Hut, hut!

577
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:11,709
[Jasmine groans]

578
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:12,976
- [whistle blows]
- Oh!

579
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:16,315
Ooh! She's not much
of a scrambler, is she?

580
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:20,150
That's all right, Jasmine!
Shake it off!

581
00:39:20,224 --> 00:39:22,522
[boy] This is a man's game, baby!

582
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:26,821
Ooh! Her mama would of saw that hit...

583
00:39:26,897 --> 00:39:28,194
Ooh, ooh.

584
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:31,227
- Welcome to football.
- Back it up!

585
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:38,932
Red 37! Red 37! Hut, hut!

586
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:44,173
- [groans]
- [whistle blows]

587
00:39:44,248 --> 00:39:45,237
Hey!

588
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:49,675
Hey. They're doing it on purpose.

589
00:39:49,754 --> 00:39:51,221
Ain't even blockin'!

590
00:39:57,261 --> 00:40:00,059
This time I'm gonna knock her
outta her training bra.

591
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:07,368
Red 19! Red 19! Hut, hut!

592
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:13,642
- [groans]
- [whistle blows]

593
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:16,580
She ain't the only girl
on the team now.

594
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:19,207
[groaning]

595
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:27,657
That's right! They'll block now!
I wish I'd have thought of that.

596
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:30,788
- Medic?
- Man.

597
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:32,691
[Macer] Good night, Ray.

598
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:41,569
- Ms. Macer.
- Oh! Oh.

599
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:45,234
Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.
Uh...

600
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:49,643
I left something in there for Jasmine.
I was coming to pick it up.

601
00:40:49,713 --> 00:40:53,581
- Um, we just locked up.
- Oh, OK.

602
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:57,052
- All right, I guess I'll get it later.
- OK.

603
00:40:57,121 --> 00:41:01,683
- So I mean, can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

604
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:03,693
You like football?

605
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:07,663
As in watching or...
[laughs] or playing?

606
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:11,895
As in watching.
Actually, watching Jasmine.

607
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:14,437
- Your niece plays football?
- Yeah.

608
00:41:14,505 --> 00:41:19,101
She's the back-up quarterback for the
Minden Browns. First game's on Saturday.

609
00:41:19,176 --> 00:41:22,304
How'd your niece
end up playing football?

610
00:41:22,379 --> 00:41:24,472
It kinda runs in the family.

611
00:41:24,548 --> 00:41:26,175
Yeah.

612
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:29,617
- So do you like football?
- Um...

613
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:36,049
- I like football.
- Cool.

614
00:41:36,126 --> 00:41:38,890
- I could pick you up at noon.
- Wait. [stammers] Hold on.

615
00:41:38,963 --> 00:41:42,194
Um, so... so are you askin' me,
like... like, on a date?

616
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:47,302
Well, I mean, it's kinda like... Yeah.

617
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:52,741
I mean, we could just go hang out,
talk, figure out what's what.

618
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:56,177
But I'd like for it to be a date.

619
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:01,614
I... I guess I wouldn't mind.

620
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:04,449
Oh, yeah? Cool.

621
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:06,922
Last drill of the day.

622
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:09,084
I call this my grilled cheese special.

623
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:11,855
Why is it called
the grilled cheese special?

624
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:15,194
Because if you knock down
all three of those cans,

625
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:18,258
I'll buy you grilled cheese
and I won't cook dinner.

626
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:20,462
Hallelujah. Let's do it.

627
00:42:23,574 --> 00:42:26,543
Yeah! Yeah, one for one.

628
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:29,101
Let's see what you got.

629
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:30,168
Come on.

630
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:35,413
Pretty good. This time, I want you
to throw it through the can.

631
00:42:36,854 --> 00:42:40,517
- Not at the can, through the can.
- OK.

632
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,258
Too high!

633
00:42:49,533 --> 00:42:51,296
- You know those people?
- No.

634
00:42:51,368 --> 00:42:53,336
- Think they know your face?
- No.

635
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,565
Come on, come on, come on!

636
00:42:58,208 --> 00:43:00,335
Right here.

637
00:43:02,546 --> 00:43:04,980
Aren't those dirty?

638
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:07,279
I mean, this one right here,

639
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:11,344
I know I can get... two more days
out of that one.

640
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,956
She's my teacher, Uncle Curtis.

641
00:43:15,025 --> 00:43:16,925
Wear something nice.

642
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:20,994
It's just barbecue sauce.

643
00:43:21,065 --> 00:43:23,863
And when you're with her today,

644
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:26,664
- don't try so hard.
- What you mean?

645
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:33,708
I mean, tell her she looks nice and...

646
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:35,404
Listen to what she has to say.

647
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:40,148
[coach] All right, defensive back,
over here, let's go.

648
00:43:40,217 --> 00:43:43,152
- Thought there'd be more people.
- For a Pop Warner game?

649
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,915
People will start coming.

650
00:43:44,989 --> 00:43:49,358
Back in the day,
we used to have this place rockin'.

651
00:43:49,426 --> 00:43:51,257
Hi.

652
00:43:51,328 --> 00:43:53,228
What up, Curt?

653
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:57,600
Time to tape your wrists up, Jasmine.

654
00:44:00,404 --> 00:44:03,305
- Ditch this watch.
- Tape over it.

655
00:44:03,374 --> 00:44:06,002
- What?
- Tape over it.

656
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:11,405
OK.

657
00:44:16,086 --> 00:44:18,316
You look nice.

658
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:21,552
Thank you. And so do you.

659
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:25,288
- It's my favorite hat.
- [man] It's his only hat.

660
00:44:25,362 --> 00:44:27,626
- [Javy] Hut, hut!
- [cheerleaders chant]

661
00:44:27,698 --> 00:44:29,598
Run, run!

662
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:33,263
- [all grunt]
- [whistle blows]

663
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:37,235
Come on, Fisher,
mix it up a little bit!

664
00:44:37,307 --> 00:44:38,774
Spread 'em out!

665
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:40,969
Come on, coach!

666
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:44,503
Come on, man, play Jasmine!

667
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:46,572
Fisher! Number 11!

668
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,278
Play Jasmine!

669
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:53,280
Play number 11!

670
00:44:54,758 --> 00:44:56,453
Come on, man, play Jasmine.

671
00:45:07,304 --> 00:45:10,671
[Jasmine] This is a total waste of time
if I don't even get to play.

672
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:12,902
When is it gonna be my time?

673
00:45:12,976 --> 00:45:17,310
Probably when it's so bad,
they gotta use you.

674
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,246
Hold up. Wait a minute.

675
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:22,942
Remember when this factory was open?

676
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,715
- Remember that?
- No, not really.

677
00:45:24,788 --> 00:45:26,050
Uh-uh.

678
00:45:26,123 --> 00:45:31,220
Oh, man! It was a whole
different vibe around here.

679
00:45:38,168 --> 00:45:40,636
- Come on.
- [cheerleaders] Be aggressive!

680
00:45:40,704 --> 00:45:44,765
- [cheerleaders continue]
- [shouting]

681
00:45:45,843 --> 00:45:47,367
Set and hut!

682
00:45:47,444 --> 00:45:50,504
[cheerleaders] B-E aggressive!
B-E aggressive!

683
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:53,709
- B-E aggressive! Spell it!
- [whistle blows]

684
00:45:53,784 --> 00:45:55,809
Yes! Whoo!

685
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:58,612
[man] Good block! Just like that!

686
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:04,493
Man, if this is a fight, they'd have
stopped this. We lost this, man.

687
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:10,923
It's all right! Come on, let's go!
Have we completed a pass today?

688
00:46:11,335 --> 00:46:13,462
Hut, hut!

689
00:46:13,537 --> 00:46:15,334
- Please, God.
- [Curtis] Coach!

690
00:46:16,707 --> 00:46:17,731
Coach Fisher!

691
00:46:20,477 --> 00:46:21,466
Jerry!

692
00:46:22,846 --> 00:46:26,475
- Let Jasmine play.
- Go back to your seat, Curtis.

693
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:29,644
Come on, coach. Let her play.

694
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,347
Give her a shot.

695
00:46:31,421 --> 00:46:34,686
She don't score, you won't hear from me.
I won't say nothing.

696
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:40,191
I swear! Aren't you sick of me yelling?
Put Jasmine in! Put Jasmine in!

697
00:46:40,264 --> 00:46:41,856
Put her in!

698
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:46,194
- Time!
- [whistle blows]

699
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:47,965
Javy!

700
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:49,933
Plummer!

701
00:46:50,908 --> 00:46:52,808
Plummer! Let's go, you're in!

702
00:46:55,078 --> 00:46:57,672
Come on, let's go!
Get that helmet on. Hustle up!

703
00:46:57,748 --> 00:46:59,238
- Yeah!
- OK.

704
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:01,546
- It's about time!
- Yes!

705
00:47:01,618 --> 00:47:05,577
- Shotgun 50-wide motion. Let's go.
- All right. I got it.

706
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:10,286
That's right. That's right, Jasmine!
Let's go! Come on, girl!

707
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,294
Oh, my God!

708
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:14,455
Hey, you guys, check this out.

709
00:47:14,531 --> 00:47:17,295
- They got a girl playin' quarterback.
- [boys snicker]

710
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:20,598
Wait, wait, no. I'm confused.
I thought they already had a girl.

711
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:21,968
[laughter continues]

712
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:25,907
All right, you guys. We're gonna do
a shotgun 50 wide-motion. Got it?

713
00:47:25,976 --> 00:47:27,637
Oh, yeah. That's gonna work.

714
00:47:28,612 --> 00:47:32,275
Check scoreboards, Manny. Wanna keep
running what we've been running?

715
00:47:34,484 --> 00:47:38,853
Yeah, that's what I thought. All right,
you guys. Shotgun 50, wide-motion flag.

716
00:47:38,922 --> 00:47:41,516
- You got it? Ready.
- Break!

717
00:47:42,893 --> 00:47:44,827
[boy] All right. Here we go.

718
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:48,594
- [boy 2] Go.
- [boy 3] Let's go guys.

719
00:47:48,665 --> 00:47:53,466
- [boy 4] Got a lady on the field!
- [boy 5] We got several of those!

720
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:55,732
- [boy 6] I got him!
- Come on.

721
00:47:57,574 --> 00:47:59,940
- Hut, hut!
- Come on, baby.

722
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:01,136
Hut, hut!

723
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:04,605
[players shouting]

724
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:11,452
[boy 7] Pass, pass, pass.

725
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:16,154
Hit Beyoncé! Hit Beyoncé!

726
00:48:18,161 --> 00:48:20,026
[boy 8] Eighty-one!

727
00:48:23,133 --> 00:48:24,532
[cheering]

728
00:48:28,105 --> 00:48:30,198
- Yeah!
- We did it! We did it!

729
00:48:30,274 --> 00:48:32,674
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

730
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:34,904
- Yes! Yes!
- [crowd cheering, whistling]

731
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,341
[Curtis] That was sweet!

732
00:48:41,685 --> 00:48:43,812
Huh? Huh?

733
00:48:43,887 --> 00:48:45,650
That's what I'm saying.

734
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:51,058
- Good going, Jasmine!
- Jasmine! That was sweet!

735
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:03,336
Way to go, Jazzmatazz!

736
00:49:03,407 --> 00:49:07,241
If you actually played the whole game,
we'd probably have won.

737
00:49:07,311 --> 00:49:09,074
- Thanks.
- That was a good game.

738
00:49:14,718 --> 00:49:18,347
What up? Come check us out.
Support the team.

739
00:49:18,422 --> 00:49:22,324
Hands release. I want that going
through your mind every snap.

740
00:49:22,392 --> 00:49:25,327
Elbow up, drive through the ball. Yeah.

741
00:49:25,395 --> 00:49:27,989
Hey, hey!

742
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:32,060
Come check out my niece play football.

743
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:34,729
Young phenom playing quarterback.

744
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:39,435
- This football with a round ball?
- No, this is the real football.

745
00:49:39,509 --> 00:49:42,444
Real football with helmets.
Come on Saturday.

746
00:49:42,512 --> 00:49:43,911
Drive, drive, drive.

747
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:46,814
OK. Drive, drive, drive it!
Pull it, pull it!

748
00:49:47,851 --> 00:49:50,251
Ball up. Down.

749
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,686
When that ball come up,
are you ready to fire?

750
00:49:52,756 --> 00:49:56,317
- I'm ready.
- Like a gun cocking back.

751
00:49:56,393 --> 00:50:00,329
Ready to shoot. Ball up.
Ready to fire.

752
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:04,026
Down. Three things a quarterback
need to remember?

753
00:50:04,101 --> 00:50:06,535
Feet, hands, release.

754
00:50:06,603 --> 00:50:09,401
Ball up. Down.

755
00:50:10,741 --> 00:50:14,199
- Ball up. Ready to fire.
- I'm ready to fire.

756
00:50:14,277 --> 00:50:15,767
You look like a quarterback.

757
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,747
- [indistinct chatter]
- [whistle blows]

758
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:22,812
She cannot lose her first start.

759
00:50:22,886 --> 00:50:26,913
Tiger left, X special. OK?
You can do this! Get in there!

760
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:30,892
Where I come from, football is played
with a round ball and feet.

761
00:50:30,961 --> 00:50:34,988
Tiger left-end special!
Tiger the left-end special!

762
00:50:35,065 --> 00:50:37,226
Let's go, Browns! Let's go!

763
00:50:38,235 --> 00:50:40,726
Blue 32! Blue 32!

764
00:50:40,804 --> 00:50:41,828
- Come on.
- Hut, hut!

765
00:50:42,572 --> 00:50:44,301
[players shouting]

766
00:50:48,145 --> 00:50:49,772
[crowd chattering excitedly]

767
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:52,238
[man] Go, go, go!

768
00:50:53,683 --> 00:50:55,548
[crowd cheering]

769
00:50:56,586 --> 00:50:58,019
[all groan]

770
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:00,450
- Goal!
- Yes!

771
00:51:00,524 --> 00:51:03,118
Goal!

772
00:51:03,193 --> 00:51:06,526
- Goal!
- It's touchdown, man! Touchdown!

773
00:51:06,596 --> 00:51:08,689
- Touchdown!
- Touchdown!

774
00:51:08,765 --> 00:51:10,323
[crowd shouting, cheering]

775
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,868
That's what I'm talking about!

776
00:51:12,936 --> 00:51:16,201
- Yeah!
- Oh, yeah. Come on!

777
00:51:16,273 --> 00:51:18,366
- That's what I'm talkin'...
- Come on.

778
00:51:27,517 --> 00:51:30,714
I did it! I did it! I'm a quarterback!
I'm a quarterback!

779
00:51:30,787 --> 00:51:32,516
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

780
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:35,080
[humming]

[squeals]

784
00:51:57,647 --> 00:51:59,012
Sorry.

785
00:52:07,824 --> 00:52:08,984
Let's go!

786
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:11,721
[all cheering]

787
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:15,755
[man] Ya'll looking good!

788
00:52:21,238 --> 00:52:24,173
[crowd chants] Plummer, Plummer,
Plummer, Plummer!

789
00:52:24,241 --> 00:52:25,606
Come on, girl!

790
00:52:28,178 --> 00:52:29,509
Let's go! Let's go!

791
00:52:29,579 --> 00:52:32,605
[cheerleaders] Let's go Thunderbolts!

792
00:52:32,682 --> 00:52:35,173
- Let's go Thunderbolts!
- Hut, hut!

793
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:37,677
- [grunts]
- [whistle blows]

794
00:52:37,754 --> 00:52:38,778
[all gasp]

795
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:42,624
What's wrong?
Got a little dirt in your skirt?

796
00:52:42,692 --> 00:52:44,922
- Back off!
- [crowd boos]

797
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:47,694
- Come on, get up. kid.
- You OK?

798
00:52:47,764 --> 00:52:48,890
Let's go.

799
00:52:48,965 --> 00:52:50,227
She all right.

800
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:53,401
That's right, good job! Good job!

801
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:56,837
Blue 52! Hut, hut!

802
00:53:08,385 --> 00:53:09,875
[shouting]

803
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:15,449
Yeah, yeah!

804
00:53:17,928 --> 00:53:20,658
Yeah! Whoo!

805
00:53:22,566 --> 00:53:24,329
[all shout]

806
00:53:25,468 --> 00:53:29,063
What's the matter?
Got a little dirt in your skirt?

807
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:31,733
Ten, nine, eight,

808
00:53:31,808 --> 00:53:34,368
seven, six, five

809
00:53:34,444 --> 00:53:37,572
four, three, two, one!

810
00:53:48,925 --> 00:53:52,793
Yeah! Yeah! We did it! We did it!

811
00:53:52,862 --> 00:53:54,420
Yeah!

812
00:53:55,031 --> 00:53:58,694
When you juked that linebacker,
I don't know what that man saw first,

813
00:53:58,768 --> 00:54:02,067
the turf or Feather's ass
when he sat on the man!

814
00:54:04,874 --> 00:54:07,638
Hey. Congrats on the game, guys.

815
00:54:08,878 --> 00:54:12,279
- What's she doing here?
- What do you think? Part of the team.

816
00:54:12,349 --> 00:54:14,817
I wouldn't be caught dead
playing football.

817
00:54:14,884 --> 00:54:17,409
If you were playing football,
you would be dead!

818
00:54:18,622 --> 00:54:22,080
- Six feet under, baby!
- Yeah, right.

819
00:54:22,158 --> 00:54:25,559
Whatever. Just don't let me
catch you in the girls room again.

820
00:54:25,629 --> 00:54:27,597
OK, Jaz-man?

821
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:29,525
Let's go.

822
00:54:30,567 --> 00:54:32,558
Attitude.

823
00:54:32,636 --> 00:54:34,297
They're just jealous.

824
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:41,676
Yep. This is it.

825
00:54:41,745 --> 00:54:46,876
This curb right here did to me
what no defense in the state could do.

826
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:51,011
Tore my ACL,
ripped every ligament in my knee.

827
00:54:51,087 --> 00:54:53,988
- What did you do?
- [scoffs]

828
00:54:54,891 --> 00:54:56,756
Got a job at the factory.

829
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:03,526
Once that closed down,

830
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,000
out of work, like everybody else.

831
00:55:07,704 --> 00:55:09,831
Why didn't you leave?

832
00:55:11,608 --> 00:55:13,508
I should have left.

833
00:55:15,211 --> 00:55:17,406
I ended up getting stuck.

834
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:24,480
<i>You know, the history of sports</i>
<i>is really a history of firsts.</i>

835
00:55:24,554 --> 00:55:26,749
<i>The first pitcher</i>
<i>to pitch a perfect game.</i>

836
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:29,485
<i>The first NFL team to go undefeated.</i>

837
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:33,791
<i>And now the first female quarterback.</i>
<i>Impossible, you say?</i>

838
00:55:33,863 --> 00:55:37,355
<i>- You haven't met Jasmine Plummer.</i>
- Hey.

839
00:55:37,434 --> 00:55:41,200
- They're talking about Jasmine.
<i>...to five straight victories.</i>

840
00:55:41,271 --> 00:55:45,571
Nobody's prouder
of this football team than I am.

841
00:55:45,642 --> 00:55:49,100
But pride doesn't win football games.

842
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:52,239
Hard work wins football games.

843
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:58,181
Individuals have stepped up: Jasmine,

844
00:55:58,254 --> 00:55:59,915
Feather, Manny.

845
00:56:01,124 --> 00:56:03,615
Individuals.

846
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:09,654
But individuals don't win football
games. Team wins football games.

847
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:14,928
We've got two games left to play
to make the post-season.

848
00:56:15,004 --> 00:56:17,768
- What wins football games?
- Hard work!

849
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:22,367
- What wins football games?
- Team!

850
00:56:23,313 --> 00:56:25,611
- What wins football games?
- Hard work!

851
00:56:25,682 --> 00:56:28,014
- What wins football games?!
- Team!

852
00:56:28,084 --> 00:56:30,746
- What wins football games?!
- Team!

853
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:31,809
Bring it in!

854
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:39,620
Browns on three! One, two, three!

855
00:56:39,696 --> 00:56:41,095
[team] Browns!

856
00:56:43,533 --> 00:56:46,468
- Special teams.
- You got it.

857
00:56:59,616 --> 00:57:01,743
[exhales]

858
00:57:05,288 --> 00:57:06,516
Coach!

859
00:57:10,894 --> 00:57:13,021
Dad!

860
00:57:27,377 --> 00:57:28,969
[sighs]

861
00:57:30,013 --> 00:57:32,208
- Hi.
- Hi.

862
00:57:33,983 --> 00:57:37,919
- How's coach?
- He's doing OK.

863
00:57:37,987 --> 00:57:42,583
But doc says too much stress, you know.

864
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:47,619
So no more football for now.

865
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:49,890
Oh.

866
00:57:50,867 --> 00:57:52,334
Hmm.

867
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:58,136
Look, Jerry asked me
to coach the team.

868
00:58:00,076 --> 00:58:01,771
That's cool.

869
00:58:03,546 --> 00:58:06,014
Curtis, I can't do this alone, man.

870
00:58:08,184 --> 00:58:09,879
Sorry.

871
00:58:09,953 --> 00:58:12,888
I just think
I'm better off in the stands.

872
00:58:12,956 --> 00:58:15,925
I ain't been on the field, man,
since... since I played.

873
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:19,428
Come on, Curtis.

874
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:21,691
Look at what you've done with Jasmine.

875
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:26,264
I know. That's just one girl, though.
It's not a whole team.

876
00:58:28,071 --> 00:58:32,371
I just seriously think I'm
the wrong guy for the job.

877
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:36,239
All right.

878
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:42,011
Well, we play Harvey in three days.

879
00:58:43,753 --> 00:58:46,950
And they're still
the best in the league.

880
00:58:50,827 --> 00:58:52,795
You know I'll be there.

881
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:56,524
Right there in the stands,
rooting you on.

882
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:39,337
What you running from?

883
00:59:42,345 --> 00:59:46,179
- I ain't running.
- I know a runner when I see one.

884
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:51,118
You're too young
to be feelin' sorry for yourself.

885
00:59:51,187 --> 00:59:54,315
And too old to be this damn stupid.

886
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:57,359
You need to get yourself
out this park, boy.

887
00:59:59,062 --> 01:00:00,529
Go.

888
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:19,173
[coach] Come on, now! We're in the
playoffs now. You better act like it!

889
01:00:19,248 --> 01:00:20,237
Do I look like?

890
01:00:20,316 --> 01:00:23,808
All right. Everybody listen up!
Heads up!

891
01:00:24,554 --> 01:00:27,216
Coach Fisher's gonna be all right.

892
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:29,258
And so are we.

893
01:00:29,325 --> 01:00:32,886
He wants us to win on Saturday,
and that's what we gonna do.

894
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:39,393
Looks like I'm gonna need a whistle
before the day's over.

895
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:40,993
Well...

896
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:42,662
I'll see if I can dig one up.

897
01:00:44,741 --> 01:00:48,370
And stay down! Stay down.
Stop. Roll! Roll! Let me see!

898
01:00:48,444 --> 01:00:49,502
Roll, baby!

899
01:00:49,579 --> 01:00:54,016
Receiver should never
have false starts. Ever. Ever.

900
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:57,018
You gotta keep your eye on the ball.

901
01:00:57,086 --> 01:00:59,316
Ready? Hut! Hut!

902
01:01:04,894 --> 01:01:08,295
The game is won right here.
Line of scrimmage.

903
01:01:08,364 --> 01:01:13,324
Give it to him, and you fake to him.
Keep your eye on him.

904
01:01:16,039 --> 01:01:18,906
- Coach.
- Yeah?

905
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:21,136
I think you're gonna need
one of these.

906
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:23,235
- [chuckles]
- [team applauds]

907
01:01:23,312 --> 01:01:25,109
Looks good, huh?

908
01:01:28,551 --> 01:01:31,952
Are you serious?
Sometimes, you face opponents

909
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:34,683
that's bigger and stronger than us.

910
01:01:34,757 --> 01:01:38,454
It's like facing a brick wall. Believe
you can run through a brick wall?

911
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:40,018
- [all] Yes, sir!
- Let me hear you say,

912
01:01:40,096 --> 01:01:41,723
- "I believe!"
- [all] I believe!

913
01:01:41,798 --> 01:01:43,163
- I believe!
- I believe!

914
01:01:43,232 --> 01:01:45,223
- Who are we?
- [all] Minden Browns!

915
01:01:45,301 --> 01:01:47,098
- Who are we?
- [all] Minden Browns!

916
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:49,070
- What we do?
- [all] We get down!

917
01:01:49,138 --> 01:01:51,436
- What we do?
- [all] We get down!

918
01:01:52,341 --> 01:01:54,138
Yeah! Yeah!

919
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:55,871
That's what I'm talking about.

920
01:01:58,147 --> 01:02:00,138
- You love us.
- That's our team!

921
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:02,116
- Who are we?
- [all] Minden Browns!

922
01:02:02,185 --> 01:02:04,016
- Who are we?
- [all] Minden Browns!

923
01:02:04,087 --> 01:02:06,681
- What do we do?
- [all] We get down!

924
01:02:06,756 --> 01:02:07,745
Yeah! Take me home!

925
01:02:07,824 --> 01:02:12,352
If we're not committed to blocking
and tackling, not committed to winning.

926
01:02:15,164 --> 01:02:16,654
- Who are we?
- [all] Minden Browns!

927
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:18,860
- Who are we?
- [all] Minden Browns!

928
01:02:18,935 --> 01:02:20,903
- What do we do?
- [all] We get down!

929
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:22,870
- What do we do?
- [all] We get down!

930
01:02:22,939 --> 01:02:24,964
This is it.
We got time for one play.

931
01:02:25,041 --> 01:02:28,169
- Y'all remember we practiced on Friday?
- [all agree]

932
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:30,576
OK, Feather, it's on you. All right?

933
01:02:30,646 --> 01:02:32,841
Run it. Run it to perfection. Let's go.

Stay on your feet!
Stay on your feet!

- Let's go, team!

936
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:46,525
Watch the back!

937
01:02:54,871 --> 01:02:56,463
Motion!

938
01:02:58,508 --> 01:02:59,839
Shift, shift!

939
01:02:59,909 --> 01:03:03,037
Blue 32! Blue 32!

[players shouting]

Sweep! Sweep!

943
01:03:17,593 --> 01:03:19,322
Not the Rooskie.

944
01:03:19,395 --> 01:03:23,456
- The Roo... They got the...
- [man] Fumblerooskie! Take it home!

945
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:27,762
[cheering, shouting]

946
01:03:30,606 --> 01:03:34,906
Rooskie! They ran the Rooskie!
The Rooskie!

947
01:03:38,247 --> 01:03:39,544
Whoo!

948
01:03:43,152 --> 01:03:46,178
- Touchdown!
- Playoffs!

949
01:03:46,255 --> 01:03:49,782
- What's a Fumblerooskie?
- Fool, don't you know anything?

950
01:04:03,706 --> 01:04:05,674
Hey!

951
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:17,547
By now, the entire country has heard
about female quarterback phenomenon,

952
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:18,644
Jasmine Plummer.

953
01:04:18,721 --> 01:04:22,589
<i>She's carried the Browns to the playoffs</i>
<i>and they need one more win</i>

954
01:04:22,658 --> 01:04:26,116
<i>to reach Pop Warner's Mid-American</i>
<i>Super Bowl for the first time</i>

955
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:30,461
<i>in 20 years. Part of that delay may have</i>
<i>to do with the harsh times</i>

956
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:33,798
<i>that have hit Minden.</i>
<i>When the town's plant closed down,</i>

957
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:37,465
<i>jobs left, poverty and crime set in.</i>

958
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:41,476
<i>That is why Jasmine Plummer's rise</i>
<i>is so crucial to the town's</i>

959
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:44,138
<i>- struggling citizens.</i>
- Hey.

960
01:04:45,448 --> 01:04:49,145
Lookit here.
I don't know about the rest of you,

961
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:52,244
but that certainly
isn't the Minden I know.

962
01:04:53,656 --> 01:04:55,146
Look outside there.

963
01:04:55,224 --> 01:04:58,751
What do you see?
Main Street, right?

964
01:04:58,828 --> 01:05:00,693
But the people in the news,

965
01:05:00,763 --> 01:05:04,164
they are only gonna see
a rundown, dirty road.

966
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:06,098
- That's true.
- At the very least,

967
01:05:06,168 --> 01:05:08,898
we can fix up our main drag,
now, can't we?

968
01:05:08,971 --> 01:05:12,372
How we supposed to do that, rev?
This town ain't got no money.

969
01:05:12,441 --> 01:05:15,308
- Nothing.
- It ain't all about the money.

970
01:05:15,378 --> 01:05:18,176
Now lookit here.
The one thing we do know

971
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:21,683
is that here in Minden,
we got heart. Hey, lookit here.

972
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:26,381
Curtis and his team have shown us that.

973
01:05:26,489 --> 01:05:28,480
Come on, ya'll.

974
01:05:28,557 --> 01:05:32,118
Remember what I said in church
about if you only focus

975
01:05:32,194 --> 01:05:35,630
on what you don't have,
you gonna forget about what you do have?

976
01:05:35,698 --> 01:05:37,165
- Hmm.
- [quiet chatter]

977
01:05:37,266 --> 01:05:40,667
Well I have another saying
when I ain't in church.

978
01:05:40,736 --> 01:05:44,832
Sometimes, you just
got to wipe your own ass.

979
01:05:48,044 --> 01:05:49,033
Amen.

980
01:05:55,184 --> 01:05:59,587
- Shoot one over the side!
- You keep doing that, man, I tell you,

981
01:05:59,655 --> 01:06:03,113
- I'll slap you upside your head.
- Get that? Hold up, hold up.

982
01:06:03,192 --> 01:06:05,092
- Wait a minute.
- Man!

983
01:06:05,161 --> 01:06:07,493
Got no time to be lookin'
at no scratch-off.

984
01:06:10,499 --> 01:06:13,434
You can reach up better
with this roller.

985
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:18,030
Give me that!

986
01:06:22,044 --> 01:06:25,536
What took you so long?
I almost killed myself.

987
01:06:25,614 --> 01:06:27,013
Looking good, Kosowski.

988
01:06:29,518 --> 01:06:33,147
- Hi, guys. Everybody's working.
- [chatter]

989
01:06:33,222 --> 01:06:36,714
- [ladder rattling]
- Whoa, whoa! Hey!

990
01:06:36,792 --> 01:06:41,559
- Kosowski! Grab that for me.
- All right.

991
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:44,292
All right. See you later.

992
01:06:44,367 --> 01:06:47,336
- Hey, Minden's back!
- Whoa!

993
01:06:47,403 --> 01:06:48,392
Minden!

994
01:06:48,504 --> 01:06:52,497
I wanna take a little time right now
to acknowledge Feathers

995
01:06:52,575 --> 01:06:55,271
for scoring an amazing touchdown
this Saturday.

996
01:06:55,344 --> 01:06:59,644
Now, my favorite part is when
my man gets in the end zone,

997
01:06:59,715 --> 01:07:01,148
he do the dance.

998
01:07:01,217 --> 01:07:04,311
Man, you got to celebrate
all that hard work.

999
01:07:04,387 --> 01:07:07,356
Let me see that dance, Feathers.
I want everybody to step in

1000
01:07:07,423 --> 01:07:09,687
and do that little dance.
See what you got.

1001

[# Tag Team: <i>Whoomp! (There It Is)]</i>

Oh, my God!

What you got, pretty boy?
What you got?

Was you even alive when that came out?

Always a breakdancer.

1008
01:07:34,817 --> 01:07:38,378
You gotta work on that. Do ya'll wanna
see what I used to do on this field

1009
01:07:38,454 --> 01:07:40,684
- when I scored?
- Come on, show us, coach.

1010
01:07:40,756 --> 01:07:43,520
When I got in the end zone,
I had to go old school.

1011
01:07:43,592 --> 01:07:45,890
- Old school.
- Jasmine, you be the ref.

1012
01:07:45,961 --> 01:07:47,189
I used to clown the ref.

1013
01:07:47,263 --> 01:07:52,565
When I scored, when I got in the
end zone, I used to look at the ref,

1014
01:07:52,635 --> 01:07:55,468
and then I used to hand him the ball.

1015
01:07:55,538 --> 01:07:57,972
Act like I've been there before.

1016
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:02,477
And that's what we gonna do on this
team. We act like we been there before.

1017
01:08:02,545 --> 01:08:05,673
We gonna have some class,
we gonna have some sportsmanship.

- What you doin' here?
- What I'm doin'?

1036
01:09:38,374 --> 01:09:41,571
I came to see my kid
play a little pigskin, brotha.

1037
01:09:41,644 --> 01:09:44,772
Been seein' her all over the TV.

Look like the apple fell
under the tree, know what I'm sayin'?

Come on, now, fix your face
and give your brother...

1040

What's all that for?
What's the matter?

1041
01:09:58,093 --> 01:10:01,256
What's the matter? Do you know
what you did to that girl?

1042
01:10:01,330 --> 01:10:04,458
By leaving her like that?
Now you gonna show up here

1043
01:10:04,533 --> 01:10:06,933
out of the blue 'cause she on TV?

1044
01:10:07,002 --> 01:10:09,402
Look, a lot of things happened, man.

1045
01:10:11,106 --> 01:10:13,131
But I'm gonna make it up to Jasmine, OK?

1046
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:17,043
How? After five years?
How you gonna make it up, huh?

1047
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:21,338
What you gonna do, you gonna waltz in
and then waltz outta her life?

1048
01:10:21,417 --> 01:10:24,909
That's what you gonna do, Roy.
I know you, Roy.

1049
01:10:24,987 --> 01:10:29,924
Crawl back to whatever rock you done
came from under. We don't need you.

- Dad?
- Showing up like this a family...

1051

Jasmine?

1052
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:39,163
Is that my baby girl?

1053

Oh, my goodness!
Look how big you got.

1054
01:10:43,739 --> 01:10:46,867
- You were amazing out there.
- We made it to the Super Bowl.

You know, you lookin' like your daddy
out there, back in his day.

Let's go and celebrate.

1061
01:11:06,996 --> 01:11:08,987
- You wanna go get some ice cream?
- OK.

1062
01:11:09,064 --> 01:11:10,895
Come on.

1063
01:11:17,306 --> 01:11:19,501
I really love football.

1064
01:11:19,575 --> 01:11:22,135
Uncle Curtis is so great.
He's been teaching me.

1065
01:11:22,211 --> 01:11:24,577
You lookin' real good out there.

1066
01:11:24,647 --> 01:11:29,243
Actually, back when I played, I was
actually better than your Uncle Curtis.

1067
01:11:29,318 --> 01:11:31,513
- Really?
- I bet he didn't tell you that.

1068
01:11:31,587 --> 01:11:35,079
- He never told me.
- I taught that boy everything he knows.

1069
01:11:35,157 --> 01:11:38,320
How to throw the ball,
how to stay in the pocket,

1070
01:11:38,394 --> 01:11:41,227
- how to read the defense, everything.
- Wow.

1071
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:44,266
But that was back
when he was a little bit skinnier.

1072
01:11:45,901 --> 01:11:47,892
So you are going to the Super Bowl.

1073
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:50,199
Yeah.

1074
01:11:50,272 --> 01:11:53,400
Now that I'm back, I'm gonna be
in them stands hollering,

1075
01:11:53,475 --> 01:11:56,740

1079
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:07,751

01:12:07,823 --> 01:12:12,089
- I said I got it.
- All right.

1081
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:14,959
All right, Jasmine.
I got some things to do.

1082
01:12:15,030 --> 01:12:17,965
- OK.
- I'll see you at the Super Bowl.

1083
01:12:18,033 --> 01:12:21,491
- OK.
- Come give me some.

1084

I just got off the phone
with Pop Warner.

1090
01:12:48,997 --> 01:12:51,625
We gotta cover
our own costs for the Super Bowl:

1091
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:57,468
Travel, hotel, insurance,
food, everything.

1092
01:12:57,539 --> 01:13:00,565
We don't need nothin' fancy,
so shouldn't be a problem.

1093
01:13:00,642 --> 01:13:03,475
- We don't have it, Curtis.
- The other team,

01:13:03,545 --> 01:13:06,070
they come from towns
that have a lot of money.

1095

ain't quite got the pocketbook.

'Cause if we got heart,
we got everything we need.

1098
01:13:16,492 --> 01:13:19,550
[man] I feel like this is the day
I'm gonna hit. Feeling lucky.

1099
01:13:19,628 --> 01:13:21,186
[man 2] Mm-hmm.

1100
01:13:21,263 --> 01:13:24,664
Whoo! Come on, now, baby.
I need a new pair of shoes!

1101
01:13:24,733 --> 01:13:27,463
You need a new game, man.
I'm tired of beating you.

1102
01:13:27,536 --> 01:13:31,597
- What's this, 1,500 in a row?
- Hold up. I got cherries.

1103
01:13:31,673 --> 01:13:34,540
- Come on.
- You hear me? I got cherries.

1104

- No, no, brother. I got cherries!

- Jesus!
- That's right!

1106
01:13:40,682 --> 01:13:43,116
- We need to cash this in!
- What about the game?

1107
01:13:43,185 --> 01:13:44,482
- Forget that!
- Hold up!

1108
01:13:47,956 --> 01:13:52,359
My most prized possession.
It might be worth more than a few bucks.

1109
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:54,225
It's for the team.

1110
01:13:56,465 --> 01:13:57,932
Thank you, Edgar.

1111
01:13:59,802 --> 01:14:04,398

That's all I know.

- They got enough!
- Put that, put that down. Come on, man.

1117
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:26,389
Come on with the cherries.
Come on, come on!

1118
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:29,431
There you go. I feel you. Come on.

1119
01:14:29,498 --> 01:14:32,661

You act like it was your money.

1123
01:14:46,949 --> 01:14:49,918
you done heard me say
how much I wanted to leave Minden.

1124
01:14:49,985 --> 01:14:53,751
Ever since my first job at the factory,

1125
01:14:53,822 --> 01:14:56,347
that's what I've been
savin' up to do.

1126
01:14:56,425 --> 01:14:59,986
But forget all that.
I wanna go to the Super Bowl.

1127
01:15:00,062 --> 01:15:02,929
With this team and that quarterback.

1128
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:09,736
So... I know it ain't much,
but I hope it's enough.

1129

- Whoa!

1130

01:22:45,493 --> 01:22:46,926
<i>She's scrambling.</i>

1231
01:22:47,028 --> 01:22:50,964
- Go!
<i>- Plummer running out of room!</i>

1232
01:22:54,402 --> 01:22:56,267
- Damon, hit it!
<i>- She steps up to pass.</i>

1233
01:23:02,677 --> 01:23:04,406
- [whistle blows]
<i>- Incomplete!</i>

1234
01:23:04,479 --> 01:23:06,140
[all groaning]

1235
01:23:10,051 --> 01:23:14,044
<i>[announcer] That is the ball game,</i>
<i>and the Eagles win.</i>

1236
01:23:14,122 --> 01:23:17,683
<i>Second straight year</i>
<i>Pop Warner champions.</i>

1237
01:23:17,759 --> 01:23:20,319
<i>Love those Eagles.</i>

1238
01:23:24,866 --> 01:23:29,769
<i>Thank you for joining us in Miami for</i>
<i>the 43rd annual Pop Warner Super Bowl.</i>

1239
01:23:29,838 --> 01:23:33,467
<i>I'm John Hayes, along with my colleague</i>
<i>here in the booth, Shaun Parker,</i>

1240
01:23:33,541 --> 01:23:37,102
<i>thanks for joining us,</i>
<i>and we'll see you again next year.</i>

1241
01:23:47,422 --> 01:23:50,220
- [man] Excuse me, Coach Plummer?
- Mm-hmm.

1242
01:23:50,291 --> 01:23:51,918
Hey, how you doing?

1243
01:23:51,993 --> 01:23:54,962
We're officials
with the Miami Pop Warner League.

1244
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:57,965
We've real impressed
with what you've accomplished.

1245
01:23:58,033 --> 01:24:01,628
- Thanks.
- I've got an opening the best team.

1246
01:24:01,703 --> 01:24:04,672
- I'd love for you to be our man.
- If you haven't noticed,

1247
01:24:04,739 --> 01:24:06,673
Miami's not a bad place to live.

1248
01:24:08,009 --> 01:24:11,069
Got that right.
It's pretty nice around here.

1249
01:24:11,146 --> 01:24:13,614
It's Miami, man.

1250
01:24:17,519 --> 01:24:18,952
I'll give you a call.

1251
01:24:30,965 --> 01:24:32,330
[mouths] I'm sorry.

1252
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:47,141
We almost there.

1253
01:24:52,020 --> 01:24:53,954
But you're just gonna leave.

1254
01:24:55,457 --> 01:24:57,186
I didn't say that.

1255
01:24:58,993 --> 01:25:01,689
I heard them offer you
the job in Miami.

1256
01:25:03,965 --> 01:25:05,557
Yeah.

1257
01:25:08,703 --> 01:25:10,728
They offered me the job.

1258
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:15,837
They can offer me a thousand jobs.
But I ain't going nowhere.

1259
01:25:18,046 --> 01:25:23,382
But Miami's your dream.
It's the place you always wanted to go.

1260
01:25:23,451 --> 01:25:27,387
That's true. And I've been there.

1261
01:25:27,455 --> 01:25:30,481
It's a cool place to visit,

1262
01:25:30,558 --> 01:25:32,651
but it ain't like home.

1263
01:25:49,844 --> 01:25:51,869
[all cheering]

1264
01:26:11,332 --> 01:26:13,129
[boy] All right, Jasmine!

1265
01:26:16,237 --> 01:26:17,898
I'm really proud of you.

1266
01:26:17,972 --> 01:26:20,702
But... we lost.

1267
01:26:20,775 --> 01:26:23,369
Baby, we did not lose. We won.

1268
01:26:23,444 --> 01:26:26,607
Honey, did you look around?

1269
01:26:26,681 --> 01:26:28,273
Look at this town.

1270
01:26:30,552 --> 01:26:32,349
Welcome back, coach.

1271
01:26:33,955 --> 01:26:35,820
You did such a good job.

1272
01:26:35,890 --> 01:26:40,884
No matter what the score was,
I think it still turned out pretty good.

1273
01:26:42,330 --> 01:26:44,924
- Dad.
- Hey.

1274
01:26:45,767 --> 01:26:49,464
Should've told you a long time ago
how proud of you I am.

1275
01:26:49,537 --> 01:26:50,902
Thanks, Dad.

1276
01:26:52,173 --> 01:26:53,970
Hey, coach!

1277
01:26:54,042 --> 01:26:55,737
Game ball.

1278
01:26:56,177 --> 01:26:59,271
[crowd applauds, cheers]

1279
01:27:01,449 --> 01:27:04,612
Jasmine! Jasmine!

1280
01:27:04,686 --> 01:27:06,176
Jasmine!

1281
01:27:08,323 --> 01:27:12,020
Look, uh... sorry I couldn't
make the game, baby girl.

1282
01:27:12,093 --> 01:27:15,722
But I did see the highlights
on the news and...

1283
01:27:15,797 --> 01:27:19,961
...you looked amazing out there.
- Roy.

1284
01:27:20,034 --> 01:27:22,025
Why don't you just leave her alone?

1285
01:27:22,103 --> 01:27:25,630
You know what?
This ain't your deal, little bro.

1286
01:27:25,707 --> 01:27:26,901
Your season's over.

1287
01:27:29,811 --> 01:27:33,042
Come here, Jasmine,
let's, uh... let's go celebrate.

1288
01:27:34,249 --> 01:27:35,580
Come on.

1289
01:27:36,818 --> 01:27:38,285
Give your father your hand.

1290
01:28:07,015 --> 01:28:08,505
[scoffs]

1291
01:28:08,583 --> 01:28:12,019
- Well, it's like that, huh?
- Yeah.

1292
01:28:13,821 --> 01:28:18,952
Well... it's not like
y'all won that game anyway.

1293
01:28:24,932 --> 01:28:27,332
- I ought to kick his ass.
- Ennis.

1294
01:28:27,402 --> 01:28:29,836
No! We'll catch him at the park!

1295
01:28:31,706 --> 01:28:35,039
- I love you, Uncle Curtis.
- I love you too.

1296
01:28:36,277 --> 01:28:37,642
It's gonna be all right.

1297
01:28:42,050 --> 01:28:44,951
Forget about him.
Let's go celebrate.

1298
01:28:46,187 --> 01:28:48,621
[crowd cheering]

1299
01:30:48,622 --> 01:30:49,622
