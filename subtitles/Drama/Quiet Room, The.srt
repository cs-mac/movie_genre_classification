1
00:00:20,467 --> 00:00:23,299
<i>It was easier in the past.</i>

2
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,566
<i>A man knew what it was</i>
<i>to be a man.</i>

3
00:00:26,567 --> 00:00:29,132
<i>You stood up for things</i>
<i>that were wrong.</i>

4
00:00:29,133 --> 00:00:31,266
<i>You had the right</i>
<i>to do so.</i>

5
00:00:31,267 --> 00:00:34,199
<i>You were expected</i>
<i>to do so.</i>

6
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,633
<i>The way you lived,</i>

7
00:00:35,634 --> 00:00:37,233
<i>the training you put</i>
<i>yourself through,</i>

8
00:00:37,234 --> 00:00:40,600
<i>prepared you for the</i>
<i>inevitable confrontations,</i>

9
00:00:40,601 --> 00:00:42,666
<i>ones that could end</i>
<i>in dismemberment</i>

10
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:44,467
<i>or even death.</i>

11
00:00:45,901 --> 00:00:48,633
<i>Then something happened.</i>

12
00:00:48,634 --> 00:00:51,500
<i>We passed laws of decency.</i>

13
00:00:51,501 --> 00:00:53,299
<i>Lawyers became our shepherds.</i>

14
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,700
<i>And what was once a fairly</i>
<i>easy thing to understand</i>

15
00:00:55,701 --> 00:00:57,633
<i>became muddled</i>
<i>in the bureaucracy</i>

16
00:00:57,634 --> 00:01:00,601
<i>of what we call</i>
<i>being civilized.</i>

17
00:01:01,767 --> 00:01:03,132
<i>A man could</i>
<i>no longer stand up</i>

18
00:01:03,133 --> 00:01:05,233
<i>to the wrongs</i>
<i>that were around him.</i>

19
00:01:05,234 --> 00:01:07,132
<i>He had to go through</i>
<i>courts and lawyers</i>

20
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:10,166
<i>and trudge through miles</i>
<i>of red tape.</i>

21
00:01:10,167 --> 00:01:13,733
<i>Women demanded equality,</i>
<i>and she got it.</i>

22
00:01:13,734 --> 00:01:15,433
<i>Not by getting</i>
<i>everything the man had,</i>

23
00:01:15,434 --> 00:01:17,266
<i>but by the man</i>
<i>being castrated</i>

24
00:01:17,267 --> 00:01:20,333
<i>in the form</i>
<i>of order.</i>

25
00:01:20,334 --> 00:01:22,633
<i>I don't care what you say.</i>

26
00:01:22,634 --> 00:01:24,333
<i>That's not progress.</i>

27
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,433
<i>It's not evolution.</i>

28
00:01:26,434 --> 00:01:28,533
<i>It's a disease,</i>
<i>and it needs someone</i>

29
00:01:28,534 --> 00:01:32,600
<i>that understands</i>
<i>what's at stake.</i>

30
00:01:32,601 --> 00:01:35,933
<i>Someone who can stand up</i>
<i>like a real man</i>

31
00:01:35,934 --> 00:01:37,766
<i>and take action</i>
<i>against injustice</i>

32
00:01:37,767 --> 00:01:40,666
<i>and unfairness</i>
<i>in this world.</i>

33
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:42,333
<i>Today.</i>

34
00:01:42,334 --> 00:01:44,867
<i>Right now.</i>

35
00:01:44,868 --> 00:01:46,367
<i>Before lunch.</i>

36
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:00,133
Number one
for the office mascot.

37
00:02:01,934 --> 00:02:04,434
Number two
for Miss Congeniality.

38
00:02:07,267 --> 00:02:11,100
Number three
for "the early bird
gets the worm."

39
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:17,600
Four for
the master brownnoser.

40
00:02:17,601 --> 00:02:20,867
Number five for
the ungrateful backstabber.

41
00:02:20,868 --> 00:02:23,166
And last but not least,

42
00:02:23,167 --> 00:02:25,133
number six..

43
00:02:26,133 --> 00:02:27,634
number six..

44
00:02:31,501 --> 00:02:33,500
Just do it.

45
00:02:33,501 --> 00:02:34,933
You can do it.

46
00:02:34,934 --> 00:02:36,033
Just do it.

47
00:02:42,501 --> 00:02:44,334
* Maconel *

48
00:02:51,367 --> 00:02:53,766
Shelby wants this
by Friday, okay?

49
00:02:53,767 --> 00:02:55,933
And make sure there's
nothing missing
this time.

50
00:02:55,934 --> 00:02:58,199
Friday, Maconel.

51
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,801
Make it happen.

52
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,800
<i>It's all about timing.</i>

53
00:03:33,801 --> 00:03:36,200
<i>Nothing worthwhile</i>
<i>is done without it.</i>

54
00:03:37,767 --> 00:03:39,634
<i>My time will come.</i>

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,399
Bob?

56
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,199
Um, my husband's
brother's family's

57
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,633
coming into town
next weekend

58
00:03:48,634 --> 00:03:50,233
and I was just kind of
wondering maybe

59
00:03:50,234 --> 00:03:53,633
if there's any possibility
you could do your yard?

60
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:55,300
I'll see what I can do.

61
00:03:58,234 --> 00:04:00,200
That'd be great.
Thanks.

62
00:04:10,868 --> 00:04:13,601
Chickened out again,
didn't you?

63
00:04:15,601 --> 00:04:17,032
I didn't chicken out.

64
00:04:17,033 --> 00:04:18,767
I just didn't think
the timing was right.

65
00:04:20,701 --> 00:04:21,900
Oh, right.
Yeah. Uh-huh.

66
00:04:21,901 --> 00:04:23,633
The timing again.

67
00:04:23,634 --> 00:04:26,366
Hey, buddy,
I think I've heard
that one before.

68
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:29,299
You should be happy
I didn't do it today.

69
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,533
'Cause if I did,
who'd be here
to feed you, huh?

70
00:04:31,534 --> 00:04:33,399
Hey, who cares
about food,

71
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,066
as long as those goddamn
bastards die, right?

72
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,767
Huh? They die.

73
00:04:38,868 --> 00:04:40,666
Fuck 'em.

74
00:04:40,667 --> 00:04:42,900
All right. Hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

75
00:04:42,901 --> 00:04:45,133
Hey. Hey, that's mine.

76
00:05:17,267 --> 00:05:18,700
<i>Now, what exactly is</i>

77
00:05:18,701 --> 00:05:20,399
<i>your fear</i>
<i>about these chickens?</i>

78
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,867
<i>Well, the fear exactly</i>

79
00:05:21,868 --> 00:05:23,166
<i>comes from the epidemic</i>

80
00:05:23,167 --> 00:05:24,733
<i>of bird flu</i>
<i>and the diseases.</i>

81
00:05:24,734 --> 00:05:27,766
<i>And then.. Pow! I mean,</i>
<i>we could all die.</i>

82
00:05:27,767 --> 00:05:29,834
<i>Well, I think that's</i>
<i>just a bit extreme.</i>

83
00:06:08,133 --> 00:06:13,234
"145100YT765."

"59871239HX."

85
00:06:22,434 --> 00:06:23,501
Check.

86
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,234
Love the hula girl.

87
00:07:23,133 --> 00:07:24,667
How's that recount coming?

88
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,199
You said Friday.
That's tomorrow.

89
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,733
Tomorrow morning.
I'd like to see it
before then.

90
00:07:30,734 --> 00:07:33,399
Why? You won't be able
to tell if I missed
anything.

91
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,099
Look, I am not going
through this with you again.

92
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,132
Come on, Harper,
I wanna get a table
with a view.

93
00:07:38,133 --> 00:07:39,299
I already reserved one.

94
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,166
Cool.
Hey, what's this?

95
00:07:42,167 --> 00:07:43,700
Hey, that's mine.
Put it down.

96
00:07:43,701 --> 00:07:44,900
Come on.
What's it do?

97
00:07:44,901 --> 00:07:46,099
Give it back.
Put it down.

98
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,933
Maybe it turns on his brain.
Give it back.

99
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:49,333
Give it back.
That's mine!

100
00:07:49,334 --> 00:07:51,999
What's the button do?
Blow up the entire world!

101
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,266
Give it back.
Give it back.

102
00:07:53,267 --> 00:07:55,132
Let it go.

103
00:07:55,133 --> 00:07:58,167
Fine, take
your stupid toy.
Hey.

104
00:08:01,534 --> 00:08:03,667
I need that list done
by 5 P.M. sharp.

105
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:58,133
I'll let you have
the honors today.

106
00:09:20,868 --> 00:09:22,133
Hey, hula man.

107
00:09:23,601 --> 00:09:25,067
Hope you didn't break
her heart too.

108
00:09:41,901 --> 00:09:46,733
09871239847.

109
00:09:46,734 --> 00:09:48,100
Check.

110
00:10:07,868 --> 00:10:10,200
Were you looking
down my blouse?
Sorry.

111
00:10:11,734 --> 00:10:13,733
Yeah, you're sorry.
Sorry you got caught.

112
00:10:13,734 --> 00:10:15,333
I thought you were
somebody else.

113
00:10:15,334 --> 00:10:17,900
Oh, so I'm not
the only one
you're harassing.

114
00:10:17,901 --> 00:10:19,466
I'm not harass..

115
00:10:19,467 --> 00:10:20,600
I have to deliver these.

116
00:10:20,601 --> 00:10:22,500
I catch you looking at me
like that again,

117
00:10:22,501 --> 00:10:23,566
I'm taking it upstairs.

118
00:10:23,567 --> 00:10:25,900
You know, they have rules
to protect women

119
00:10:25,901 --> 00:10:27,601
from men like you!

120
00:10:33,267 --> 00:10:34,767
Mr. Harper?

121
00:10:50,434 --> 00:10:51,501
Maconel!

122
00:10:53,901 --> 00:10:56,267
You are so lucky
you didn't go home.

123
00:10:57,434 --> 00:10:58,867
I wasn't going home.

124
00:10:58,868 --> 00:11:00,333
Then where were you?

125
00:11:00,334 --> 00:11:03,099
I told you I wanted
that list by 5.

126
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,266
That's why I brought them
up to your office,

127
00:11:05,267 --> 00:11:06,733
but you weren't there.

128
00:11:06,734 --> 00:11:09,666
Of course
I wasn't there.

129
00:11:09,667 --> 00:11:11,667
I was down here
looking for you.

130
00:11:13,467 --> 00:11:16,099
I thought you wanted me
to deliver them.

131
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,900
You thought.

132
00:11:17,901 --> 00:11:19,700
You thought?

133
00:11:19,701 --> 00:11:21,367
Give me this.

134
00:11:23,601 --> 00:11:25,166
You didn't
staple it?

135
00:11:25,167 --> 00:11:26,600
I used a paper clip.

136
00:11:26,601 --> 00:11:28,366
Well, that was
really smart,
wasn't it?

137
00:11:28,367 --> 00:11:30,533
Hey, Harp.
Shelby wants you in
on this conference call.

138
00:11:30,534 --> 00:11:31,666
Okay.

139
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:32,800
Staple those together

140
00:11:32,801 --> 00:11:35,433
and wait in your cube
until I get back.

141
00:11:35,434 --> 00:11:37,167
We're not done
with this.

142
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,466
<i>There comes a time</i>

143
00:11:49,467 --> 00:11:51,199
<i>when the diseased</i>
<i>and the weak</i>

144
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,533
<i>must be sacrificed</i>

145
00:11:52,534 --> 00:11:54,067
<i>in order to save the herd.</i>

146
00:11:58,067 --> 00:12:00,533
One for the office mascot.

147
00:12:00,534 --> 00:12:03,299
Number two
for Miss Congeniality.

148
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,434
Number three for
"the early bird gets
the worm."

149
00:12:07,434 --> 00:12:10,666
Four for
the master brownnoser.

150
00:12:10,667 --> 00:12:14,600
Number five for
the ungrateful backstabber.

151
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:16,766
And last but not least,

152
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,701
number six..

153
00:12:19,701 --> 00:12:21,333
number six..

154
00:12:21,334 --> 00:12:23,333
Just do it.

155
00:12:23,334 --> 00:12:24,900
Just do it.

156
00:12:24,901 --> 00:12:26,300
Just do it.

157
00:12:30,567 --> 00:12:31,834
Oh, shit.

158
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,200
Maconel!

159
00:12:38,634 --> 00:12:40,399
I told that drone
not to leave.

160
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,868
Hey, anybody seen Maconel?

161
00:13:18,901 --> 00:13:19,834
Coleman?

162
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:22,934
Maconel.

163
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,167
Ralf, look
at what you did.

164
00:13:29,033 --> 00:13:30,100
Yeah.

165
00:13:31,367 --> 00:13:33,200
How did it feel?

166
00:13:36,467 --> 00:13:37,400
Satisfying.

167
00:13:40,467 --> 00:13:42,234
Christ.
Coleman?

168
00:13:43,801 --> 00:13:46,634
Shit.
Shit.

169
00:13:51,701 --> 00:13:53,333
I think that's
your cue to leave.

170
00:13:53,334 --> 00:13:54,999
You don't kill
this many people

171
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,801
and simply walk away.

172
00:13:57,934 --> 00:13:58,901
No trial.

173
00:14:01,734 --> 00:14:02,667
No trial.

174
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,999
Oh, my God,
it's Vanessa.

175
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,733
Vanessa?

176
00:14:09,734 --> 00:14:11,567
I thought it was
that Paula bitch.

177
00:14:12,767 --> 00:14:14,233
It's a common mistake.

178
00:14:14,234 --> 00:14:16,399
I liked Vanessa.

179
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,700
She has a good smile.

180
00:14:17,701 --> 00:14:19,701
Great smile.

181
00:14:20,868 --> 00:14:22,801
She could light up a room
with that thing.

182
00:14:24,667 --> 00:14:27,600
She's alive.
Vanessa's still alive.

183
00:14:27,601 --> 00:14:29,633
Hey. Whoa.
What are you doing?

184
00:14:29,634 --> 00:14:32,500
I thought you liked her.
That's why I wanna put her
out of her misery.

185
00:14:32,501 --> 00:14:33,766
How do you know
she's in misery?

186
00:14:33,767 --> 00:14:35,700
Believe me,
it is better this way.

187
00:14:35,701 --> 00:14:38,466
Wait. Don't you need
that last bullet
for yourself?

188
00:14:38,467 --> 00:14:40,199
Don't be telling me
how to do this, Maconel.

189
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,933
It's only because
you're lamer than I am,

190
00:14:41,934 --> 00:14:43,466
I haven't blown you away
at this point.

191
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:45,433
Excuse me,
but in as much
as we may have

192
00:14:45,434 --> 00:14:47,166
the same feelings
about these people,

193
00:14:47,167 --> 00:14:48,900
I'm not half as lame
as you are.

194
00:14:48,901 --> 00:14:50,066
Oh, no?

195
00:14:50,067 --> 00:14:51,733
Then you tell me
what you'd call a man

196
00:14:51,734 --> 00:14:53,266
who's stupid enough
to piss off a maniac

197
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,868
with a fucking
loaded gun.

198
00:14:57,501 --> 00:14:59,066
I'd call him
a maniac..

199
00:14:59,067 --> 00:15:01,366
with his own fucking
loaded gun.

200
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:02,300
Ha.

201
00:15:09,901 --> 00:15:10,868
That was six.

202
00:15:30,234 --> 00:15:31,801
Vanessa.

203
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,133
It's okay.

204
00:15:38,801 --> 00:15:39,901
You're gonna make it.

205
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,467
Let me see that smile.

206
00:15:45,801 --> 00:15:46,800
Come on.

207
00:15:46,801 --> 00:15:48,234
Come on,
you can do it.

208
00:15:50,801 --> 00:15:52,434
There you go.

209
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,167
It really does
light up a room.

210
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,334
It's okay.

211
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,733
They're coming.
They're coming.
It's okay.

212
00:16:06,734 --> 00:16:08,433
It's okay.

213
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:11,166
It's okay.

214

For your information,

241
00:17:03,367 --> 00:17:05,399
I did pull
the trigger today.

242
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,700
No shit.

243
00:17:06,701 --> 00:17:08,299
Then what are you
doing here..

244
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,601
alive?

245
00:17:10,834 --> 00:17:12,366
It's a long story.

246
00:17:12,367 --> 00:17:13,633
Well, where the hell
are we going?

247
00:17:13,634 --> 00:17:15,132
Talk to me.
Some other time.

248
00:17:15,133 --> 00:17:16,333
Well, at least tell us

249
00:17:16,334 --> 00:17:18,266
if those fucking bastards

250
00:17:18,267 --> 00:17:19,299
are dead.

251
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,234
Those fucking bastards

252
00:17:22,701 --> 00:17:24,667
All right.

253
00:17:27,567 --> 00:17:29,032
So when are you leaving
for Fiji?

254
00:17:29,033 --> 00:17:31,299
Well, not for..
We have two weeks
next month.

255
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,700
Oh, wonderful.
Yeah.

256
00:17:32,701 --> 00:17:34,032
How'd your wife..

257
00:17:34,033 --> 00:17:35,767
Yeah, we're bringing
a nanny, so, I mean..

258
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,733
Hello, Mr. Maconel.
My name is Derrick Miles.

259
00:17:44,734 --> 00:17:47,500
I wonder if I might ask
you a few questions
about what happened at IDT.

260
00:17:47,501 --> 00:17:49,766
I'm with <i>The Herald.</i>
How did you get
my name?

261
00:17:49,767 --> 00:17:51,933
They said they wouldn't
give out my name.
Come on, Mr. Maconel,

262
00:17:51,934 --> 00:17:53,466
you can't keep something
like this a secret.

263
00:17:53,467 --> 00:17:54,867
You're an
honest-to-God hero.

264
00:17:54,868 --> 00:17:57,334
I only killed one man.
Yeah, but you killed
the right man.

265
00:17:58,767 --> 00:18:00,633
Look, do you think
we could continue
this conversation inside?

266
00:18:00,634 --> 00:18:02,433
No.

267
00:18:02,434 --> 00:18:04,533
Please, you'd make it
so much easier on yourself

268
00:18:04,534 --> 00:18:05,867
if you just tell
your story to one person.

269
00:18:05,868 --> 00:18:07,032
It's called an exclusive.

270
00:18:07,033 --> 00:18:08,633
You're not coming
into my house.

271
00:18:08,634 --> 00:18:10,800
Please, Mr. Maconel,
let me in before
these vultures

272
00:18:10,801 --> 00:18:13,100
twist your life
all out of proportion.
No!

273
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,801
Mr. Maconel,
please, sir!

274
00:18:20,601 --> 00:18:22,833
Go away!

275
00:18:22,834 --> 00:18:23,968
Go away!

276
00:18:29,267 --> 00:18:31,601
We're here from
Channel 5 News..

277
00:18:39,367 --> 00:18:40,968
Mr. Maconel!

278
00:18:43,968 --> 00:18:45,634
Welcome
to our world, Bob.

279
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,800
<i>And we are back</i>

There went <i>our</i> 15 minutes.

288
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:54,766
Bob?

289
00:19:54,767 --> 00:19:56,566
Hi.

290
00:19:56,567 --> 00:19:58,733
You know how
I was telling you
my company was coming in?

291
00:19:58,734 --> 00:20:00,566
Is my lawn
bothering you again?

292
00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:02,466
No, no, no, no, no.

293
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:04,500
Actually,
I was wondering,

294
00:20:04,501 --> 00:20:06,132
since we're having
a small

295
00:20:06,133 --> 00:20:07,333
Christmas barbeque
this weekend,

296
00:20:07,334 --> 00:20:08,601
that maybe you'd like
to stop by.

297
00:20:10,934 --> 00:20:13,199
It'd be nice to get
to know our new neighbor.

298
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,367
I've lived here
five years.

299
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,634
Oh, my,
how time flies.

300
00:20:32,534 --> 00:20:34,199
There he is.
There's the man.

301
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,766
Our champ.

302
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:37,266
Way to go, Bob.

303
00:20:37,267 --> 00:20:39,501
Well done, Maconel.

304
00:20:44,801 --> 00:20:46,766
Hey, there he is!
Hey, Bob.

305
00:20:46,767 --> 00:20:48,566
No, Mr. Maconel.

306
00:20:48,567 --> 00:20:50,099
You don't work here anymore.

307
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,200
Come on.

308
00:20:52,734 --> 00:20:53,801
Have I been fired?

309
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,399
No. Come on.

310
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,867
Where are we going?

311
00:20:58,868 --> 00:21:00,234
All the way.

312
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,733
You know, I just think
it's so great what you did.

313
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:20,334
Now maniacs will think twice
before going crazy.

314

He's waiting for you,

00:22:13,067 --> 00:22:16,500
I am so glad
to finally meet you.

321
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,700
Can.. Can I get you anything?

322
00:22:18,701 --> 00:22:20,733
Something to drink?
A Pepsi or something?

323
00:22:20,734 --> 00:22:22,967
Oh, Bob,
this is Maurice Gregory.

324
00:22:22,968 --> 00:22:25,967
I brought Maurice in
to help the employees

325
00:22:25,968 --> 00:22:27,366
work through their anxiety

326
00:22:27,367 --> 00:22:28,700
during the healing process.

327
00:22:28,701 --> 00:22:31,366
Maurice is a good man
and a gifted psychiatrist.

328
00:22:31,367 --> 00:22:33,933
Psychiatrist?
Grief counselor.

329
00:22:33,934 --> 00:22:35,800
Here, have a seat.

330
00:22:35,801 --> 00:22:37,666
Have <i>my</i> seat.

331
00:22:37,667 --> 00:22:39,200
Sit down, sit down.

332
00:22:46,567 --> 00:22:49,366
A lot of people asked
about you at the eulogy.

333
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:50,967
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I wanted to..

334
00:22:50,968 --> 00:22:53,700
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
You don't have
to explain yourself.

335
00:22:53,701 --> 00:22:56,299
No, I'm sure this
has been a little bit
overwhelming to you.

336
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,299
It has.

337
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,299
But you've gotta
understand,

338
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,533
It takes a very
rare individual

339
00:23:00,534 --> 00:23:01,800
to keep his head

340
00:23:01,801 --> 00:23:03,132
and then take action

341
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:05,700
in the face
of certain death.

342
00:23:05,701 --> 00:23:07,766
I'm a veteran.

343
00:23:07,767 --> 00:23:10,533
I've had my scrapes,
let me tell you.

344
00:23:10,534 --> 00:23:12,199
But I knew
who my enemy was.

345
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,733
I knew what I was getting
into on the way in.

346
00:23:14,734 --> 00:23:16,566
These days..

347
00:23:16,567 --> 00:23:18,366
it can come
from anywhere..

348
00:23:18,367 --> 00:23:19,566
at any time..

349
00:23:19,567 --> 00:23:21,032
from anyone.

350
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:22,666
That's true.

351
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:24,500
Forgive my morbid
curiosity,

352
00:23:24,501 --> 00:23:26,767
but did you actually
see it happen?

353
00:23:27,868 --> 00:23:29,533
I saw..

354
00:23:29,534 --> 00:23:31,867
bodies hit the floor.

355
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:33,233
Jesus.

356
00:23:33,234 --> 00:23:35,666
How did you manage
to not get shot?

357
00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:38,767
Well, I was..

358
00:23:39,901 --> 00:23:41,800
I was.. I dropped
a paper clip,

359
00:23:41,801 --> 00:23:43,566
so I was already
on the floor.

360
00:23:43,567 --> 00:23:44,999
Oh, my God.

361
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,767
Can you imagine that?
A paper clip saved his life.

362
00:23:49,467 --> 00:23:52,233
But then you saw
your fellow workers dying
right in front of your eyes.

363
00:23:52,234 --> 00:23:53,801
It must have made you
feel terrible.

364
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,600
That was a really
stupid thing to say.

365
00:23:57,601 --> 00:23:58,900
Of course
you felt terrible.

366
00:23:58,901 --> 00:24:00,900
What am I thinking?
What else are you gonna feel?

367
00:24:00,901 --> 00:24:04,266
But then you
pulled it together.

368
00:24:04,267 --> 00:24:05,700
Right?

369
00:24:05,701 --> 00:24:08,433
And you, um..

370
00:24:08,434 --> 00:24:09,968
And, uh..

371
00:24:11,634 --> 00:24:13,466
And, well,
here we are.

372
00:24:13,467 --> 00:24:15,999
All right, enough of this
depressing conversation.

373
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,433
I'm sure that you
and Maurice

374
00:24:17,434 --> 00:24:19,299
will hash out
that nightmare later.

375
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,334
Right now I want you
to come with me.
Come on.

376
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,233
Bob, come on.

377
00:24:28,234 --> 00:24:30,466
I pride myself
on recognizing potential,

378
00:24:30,467 --> 00:24:31,967
and as tragic
as this event has been,

379
00:24:31,968 --> 00:24:33,900
it's opened my eyes
to a real talent

380
00:24:33,901 --> 00:24:36,500
that's been going to waste
right beneath my nose.

381
00:24:36,501 --> 00:24:38,032
I'm glad I met you.
Me?

382
00:24:38,033 --> 00:24:39,566
And don't try to tell me
you're satisfied

383
00:24:39,567 --> 00:24:40,999
with your present
position here.

384
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,132
Yeah.
I know, I know.

385
00:24:42,133 --> 00:24:44,233
You feel wasted,
unchallenged,

386
00:24:44,234 --> 00:24:45,566
like you've got good ideas

387
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:46,900
but no one
will listen, right?

388
00:24:46,901 --> 00:24:48,566
Come on,
be honest with me.

389
00:24:48,567 --> 00:24:50,933
It has been a long time
since anybody asked me
what I thought.

390
00:24:50,934 --> 00:24:52,399
Yeah, well,
those days are over,

391
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,500
because from now on,
I want to know

392
00:24:54,501 --> 00:24:57,733
what Bob Maconel
is thinking every day.

393
00:24:57,734 --> 00:24:59,601
Welcome to your new
think tank.

394
00:25:01,901 --> 00:25:04,900
So, tell me, Bob.

395
00:25:04,901 --> 00:25:06,833
What are you thinking now?

396
00:25:06,834 --> 00:25:08,999
I'm thinking how
I requested a window
for years,

397
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,800
and they said they
didn't have any left.

398
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:15,533
Yeah, well, a few
became available
last week.

399
00:25:15,534 --> 00:25:16,733
That's right.

400
00:25:16,734 --> 00:25:18,600
This is the office
of one of the victims.

401
00:25:18,601 --> 00:25:21,266
My personal assistant.
Vanessa Parks?

402
00:25:21,267 --> 00:25:22,566
Vanessa died?

403
00:25:22,567 --> 00:25:24,800
No, no.

404
00:25:24,801 --> 00:25:26,999
But she won't
be coming back.

405
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,900
Did you know her?

406
00:25:28,901 --> 00:25:30,466
Just her smile.

407
00:25:30,467 --> 00:25:33,166
Yeah, she could light up
a room with that.

408
00:25:33,167 --> 00:25:34,999
Did you go to visit her
at Saint Michael's?

409
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,366
No.

410
00:25:36,367 --> 00:25:38,032
No?

411
00:25:38,033 --> 00:25:39,433
Bob.

412
00:25:39,434 --> 00:25:41,500
You've got
to go visit her.
Why?

413
00:25:41,501 --> 00:25:43,399
Why? Because you
saved her life.

414
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,299
My God, man, the woman
is probably desperate
to thank you.

415
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,533
She doesn't even
know my name.

416
00:25:47,534 --> 00:25:48,700
I'm not suggesting it, Bob.

417
00:25:48,701 --> 00:25:49,833
I'm telling you.

418
00:25:49,834 --> 00:25:52,399
Go visit her today.

419
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,066
During work hours?

420
00:25:54,067 --> 00:25:56,566
Think of it as
your first assignment..

421
00:25:56,567 --> 00:25:59,801
as Vice President
of Creative Thinking.

422
00:26:01,467 --> 00:26:03,032
You're gonna pay me
to think?

423
00:26:03,033 --> 00:26:04,701
It's a crazy world.

424
00:26:05,934 --> 00:26:06,933
Oh, oh, oh, Bob.

425
00:26:06,934 --> 00:26:09,132
When you, uh..
When you go see Vanessa,

426
00:26:09,133 --> 00:26:10,633
I want you to take
this with you

427
00:26:10,634 --> 00:26:11,733
and give it
to her personally.

428
00:26:11,734 --> 00:26:15,067
It's just some
final work papers.

429
00:26:16,234 --> 00:26:17,501
Oh, wait, Bob.

430
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,467
Why don't you take
your company car?

431
00:26:35,701 --> 00:26:38,999
Christ Almighty,
it's Maconel.

432
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,466
You sly dog,
playing possum
all these years.

433
00:26:41,467 --> 00:26:43,233
Certainly had me fooled.

434
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:45,800
You know, I heard you
were back, but I didn't
see you in the pit.

435
00:26:45,801 --> 00:26:47,233
I'm upstairs now.

436
00:26:47,234 --> 00:26:48,333
And rightfully so.

437
00:26:48,334 --> 00:26:49,867
All right,
now the big question.

438
00:26:49,868 --> 00:26:51,533
How many rounds

439
00:26:51,534 --> 00:26:54,433
did you pump into that
sick-ass Coleman, huh?

440
00:26:54,434 --> 00:26:55,666
Come on, Bob.
How many?

441
00:26:55,667 --> 00:26:57,166
Two, three?
Five.

442
00:26:57,167 --> 00:26:58,967
Five!

443
00:26:58,968 --> 00:27:00,066
Pay up, sucker.

444
00:27:00,067 --> 00:27:02,166
Hey, last time I doubt
this man's drive.

445
00:27:02,167 --> 00:27:03,700
Oh, Bob.

446
00:27:03,701 --> 00:27:05,099
You should join
our foursome.

447
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,666
We could use somebody
with your killer instinct

448
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:07,867
on the back nine.
Oh, man.

449
00:27:07,868 --> 00:27:10,132
Cooper's guys would shit
if we brought him out.

450
00:27:10,133 --> 00:27:11,733
Yeah.

451
00:27:11,734 --> 00:27:14,833
Hey, uh, happy hour
this evening.

452
00:27:14,834 --> 00:27:15,933
Barney's.

453
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:17,566
It's right across
the street.

454
00:27:17,567 --> 00:27:20,200
Lose the briefcase, Bob.
You're an executive now.

455
00:28:03,701 --> 00:28:06,366
I'd like to visit
Vanessa Parks.

456
00:28:06,367 --> 00:28:07,366
That poor girl.

457
00:28:07,367 --> 00:28:08,366
Your name?

458
00:28:08,367 --> 00:28:10,466
Bob Maconel.

459
00:28:10,467 --> 00:28:11,766
Bob Maconel?

460
00:28:11,767 --> 00:28:13,533
<i>The</i> Bob Maconel?
Yeah.

461
00:28:13,534 --> 00:28:15,566
Honey, you gotta learn
to speak up.

462
00:28:15,567 --> 00:28:17,701
My husband thinks
you should run for mayor.

463
00:28:19,133 --> 00:28:21,233
Hey, Thelma!
Thelma, answer my phones.

464
00:28:21,234 --> 00:28:24,234
I gotta take
Bob Maconel here
to visit Vanessa.

465
00:28:25,701 --> 00:28:28,299
We were so proud to see you.
It's wonderful what..

466
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,266
It's this way..
It's wonderful
what you did.

467
00:28:30,267 --> 00:28:32,867
In fact, we have your picture
hanging in the cafeteria.

468
00:28:32,868 --> 00:28:34,800
And of course,
everybody wants you
to sign it.

469
00:28:34,801 --> 00:28:36,333
How is she?

470
00:28:36,334 --> 00:28:37,900
You haven't heard?

471
00:28:37,901 --> 00:28:40,132
Only that she isn't
coming back to work.

472
00:28:40,133 --> 00:28:42,600
That bullet was right
in her spine.

473
00:28:42,601 --> 00:28:44,967
After the swelling went down
and they removed it,

474
00:28:44,968 --> 00:28:46,999
the nerves never got
back together again.

475
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,333
What are you saying?
She's..

476
00:28:48,334 --> 00:28:49,733
Paralyzed.

477
00:28:49,734 --> 00:28:52,334
How much?
Like, her legs?

478
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:56,233
Vanessa?

479
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,900
There's a visitor here
to see you.

480
00:28:57,901 --> 00:29:00,900
No, no.

481
00:29:00,901 --> 00:29:02,267
Honey,
it's Bob Maconel.

482
00:29:05,767 --> 00:29:07,300
It's the hula man.

483
00:29:09,367 --> 00:29:10,634
Be right outside.

484
00:29:13,601 --> 00:29:16,167
So, you're the man
that saved me.

485
00:29:17,701 --> 00:29:19,566
I guess so.

486
00:29:19,567 --> 00:29:21,701
I've been wanting so much
to meet you.

487
00:29:24,534 --> 00:29:25,667
Can you come here?

488
00:29:32,767 --> 00:29:34,701
Closer.

489
00:29:40,067 --> 00:29:41,000
Closer.

490
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:48,200
Closer.

491
00:29:59,901 --> 00:30:01,099
Son of a bitch!

492
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,833
I was a goddess.

493
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:04,366
Now look at me!
I can't move!

494
00:30:04,367 --> 00:30:05,800
I can't dance!

495
00:30:05,801 --> 00:30:07,968
I certainly can't
fuck now, can I?

496
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,501
You should have let
Coleman finish the job!

497
00:30:12,834 --> 00:30:14,900
You should have let me die!

498
00:30:14,901 --> 00:30:16,999
Fuck You!

499
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,800
I should have died.

500
00:30:19,801 --> 00:30:21,833
You should have
let him kill me.

501
00:30:21,834 --> 00:30:23,267
Fuck!

502
00:30:26,634 --> 00:30:27,901
I hate you!

503
00:30:51,033 --> 00:30:53,199
Hey, Maconel.

504
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,299
Just in time.
We're going to Barney's.

505
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,166
Come on.
Put it in park
and shake a leg.

506
00:30:57,167 --> 00:30:58,867
It's happy hour.
I don't want to be happy.

507
00:30:58,868 --> 00:31:00,967
Nonsense.
Everybody wants
to be happy.

508
00:31:00,968 --> 00:31:02,800
I have to punch in
my time card.

509
00:31:02,801 --> 00:31:05,600
What, are you nuts?
Executives don't have
time cards.

510
00:31:05,601 --> 00:31:06,900
Come on.
I don't drink.

511
00:31:06,901 --> 00:31:09,634
Great. It saves more
for the rest of us!
Right.

512
00:31:17,067 --> 00:31:18,867
Doesn't drink, my ass.

513
00:31:18,868 --> 00:31:21,766
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

514
00:31:21,767 --> 00:31:22,833
Oh.

515
00:31:22,834 --> 00:31:23,901
That was six.

516
00:31:31,167 --> 00:31:32,967
Bob..

517
00:31:32,968 --> 00:31:35,433
I gotta admit..

518
00:31:35,434 --> 00:31:37,800
that day..

519
00:31:37,801 --> 00:31:38,999
I about shit my pants

520
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,199
when I saw Coleman
raise that gun at me.

521
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,266
Cliché as it sounds,
my whole life flashed
before my eyes,

522
00:31:45,267 --> 00:31:47,434
and I can't say
I'm proud of much of it.

523
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,366
But you.. God.

524
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:52,900
You.

525
00:31:52,901 --> 00:31:56,600
You're standing there
cool as ice..

526
00:31:56,601 --> 00:32:01,399
staring that guy down
one-on-one.

527
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,833
It's amazing.

528
00:32:02,834 --> 00:32:04,534
It's fucking amazing.

529
00:32:06,067 --> 00:32:07,466
Yeah, but there's..

530
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:10,901
There's one question
that's been stuck
in my brain.

531
00:32:12,234 --> 00:32:14,900
If you had a gun,

532
00:32:14,901 --> 00:32:18,000
why did you wait till
the shooting stopped
to use it?

533
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,633
Hey, forget it.

534
00:32:22,634 --> 00:32:24,399
You know,
the important
thing is..

535
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,766
that I didn't get
my ass blown off
that day,

536
00:32:26,767 --> 00:32:28,800
and I know
I probably have you
to thank for it.

537
00:32:28,801 --> 00:32:30,032
Uh, another round here.

538
00:32:30,033 --> 00:32:31,466
Ugh, no six.

539
00:32:31,467 --> 00:32:33,766
Oh, shit.
There he is.

540
00:32:33,767 --> 00:32:37,833
The Mind Fucker.

541
00:32:37,834 --> 00:32:39,466
I need to go home.

542
00:32:39,467 --> 00:32:41,066
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, hey.

543
00:32:41,067 --> 00:32:44,066
Oh, hey, Bob.
You okay?

544
00:32:44,067 --> 00:32:46,333
Man, he's
fucked up!

545
00:32:46,334 --> 00:32:48,266
Uh, somebody ought
to drive him home.

546
00:32:48,267 --> 00:32:51,433
Yeah, well,
I'm in the other
direction.

547
00:32:51,434 --> 00:32:54,800
I'll take him home.

548
00:32:54,801 --> 00:32:56,766
Now, I hope you didn't

549
00:32:56,767 --> 00:32:59,099
take what I said
last week too seriously.

550
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,032
I mean, a girl's got
to protect herself

551
00:33:01,033 --> 00:33:02,833
from getting stuck
with a loser.

552
00:33:02,834 --> 00:33:04,266
You know,

553
00:33:04,267 --> 00:33:07,233
a guy with no future,

554
00:33:07,234 --> 00:33:09,801
no balls.

555
00:33:10,868 --> 00:33:12,366
It's not you, Bob.

556
00:33:12,367 --> 00:33:16,334
I mean, everyone knows that
you've got a great future.

557
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,733
Now, as for the balls..

558
00:33:21,734 --> 00:33:23,666
you've certainly
proven it.

559
00:33:23,667 --> 00:33:26,434
Ugh.
You've got a great
big set of those.

560
00:33:28,534 --> 00:33:29,867
I'd be more than honored

561
00:33:29,868 --> 00:33:33,666
if you'd like to take
another look down my blouse.

562
00:33:33,667 --> 00:33:35,999
Actually..

563
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,166
No!

564
00:33:38,167 --> 00:33:40,366
Oh, fuck!

565
00:33:40,367 --> 00:33:42,766
**

566
00:33:42,767 --> 00:33:46,199
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

567
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,099
Hey, nice tits!

568
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:52,100
Fuck you,
asshole! Fuck!

569
00:33:53,267 --> 00:33:54,634
Hi.

570
00:33:58,934 --> 00:34:01,868
Hello? Hey, Shithead.

571
00:34:03,367 --> 00:34:04,700
Get up.

572
00:34:04,701 --> 00:34:06,634
Wake up!

573
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,733
Christ Almighty.

574
00:34:09,734 --> 00:34:12,466
The master lives.

575
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:15,233
Now, could you feed us
before we all die?

576
00:34:15,234 --> 00:34:16,433
You'd better hurry,

577
00:34:16,434 --> 00:34:19,967
Stripes is rolling
for the third time.

578
00:34:19,968 --> 00:34:22,566
You happen to see the lady
that brought me here?

579
00:34:22,567 --> 00:34:24,666
Don't work
that way, Bob.

580
00:34:24,667 --> 00:34:28,333
You don't see it,
we don't see it.
Remember?

581
00:34:28,334 --> 00:34:30,067
Nice tits, though.

582
00:34:34,901 --> 00:34:37,233
Bob.

583
00:34:37,234 --> 00:34:38,833
There he is.

584
00:34:38,834 --> 00:34:40,600
My best
drinkin' buddy.

585
00:34:40,601 --> 00:34:42,600
So, uh, Bob,

586
00:34:42,601 --> 00:34:43,933
was it hot, huh?

587
00:34:43,934 --> 00:34:45,600
Was she everything
she thinks she is?

588
00:34:45,601 --> 00:34:46,900
I honestly can't say.

589
00:34:46,901 --> 00:34:48,433
Okay, a gentleman.

590
00:34:48,434 --> 00:34:50,199
Okay.
We're going to have
to work on that.

591
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,833
Have you seen her?
No.

592
00:34:51,834 --> 00:34:53,299
Not yet, but, uh,

593
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,766
I did see Mr. Shelby.
He's looking for you,

594
00:34:55,767 --> 00:34:58,233
some important assignment

595
00:34:58,234 --> 00:34:59,700
you were supposed
to take care of?

596
00:34:59,701 --> 00:35:01,166
Yes.

597
00:35:01,167 --> 00:35:03,666
I got to go.

598
00:35:03,667 --> 00:35:05,667
Hey, Bob.

599
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,100
Bob?

600
00:35:16,033 --> 00:35:17,466
I need to see
Vanessa Parks.

601
00:35:17,467 --> 00:35:19,967
Oh, that poor girl,
are you a relative?
No.

602
00:35:19,968 --> 00:35:22,900
Well, only relatives
are allowed in during
non-visiting hours.

603
00:35:22,901 --> 00:35:24,999
I'm Bob Maconel.

604
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,666
Oh, I don't believe
you're here..

605
00:35:26,667 --> 00:35:27,933
I know I upset her before..

606
00:35:27,934 --> 00:35:30,666
I've been trying
to get a hold of you.
What?

607
00:35:30,667 --> 00:35:32,867
Vanessa. She wanted
to see you again.

608
00:35:32,868 --> 00:35:35,566
<i>Dr. Steven Chang</i>
<i>to Cardio-Path Lab,</i>

609
00:35:35,567 --> 00:35:37,600
<i>Dr. Steven Chang..</i>

610
00:35:37,601 --> 00:35:39,801
Hi.

611
00:35:41,901 --> 00:35:45,299
Can you close
the door, please?

612
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,999
Certainly was fast.

613
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,967
Actually, I was
coming to see you.

614
00:35:49,968 --> 00:35:52,132
I was supposed to give
this to you yesterday.

615
00:35:52,133 --> 00:35:55,032
It's from Mr. Shelby.

616
00:35:55,033 --> 00:35:57,999
I'm sure he would
have delivered it
himself, but uh,

617
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,600
he's been real busy
with everything
that's happened.

618
00:36:00,601 --> 00:36:01,868
I'm sure.

619
00:36:04,234 --> 00:36:06,500
I could open it
and read it to you.

620
00:36:06,501 --> 00:36:08,400
No.

621
00:36:11,267 --> 00:36:13,433
Well, where would you
like me to put it?

622
00:36:13,434 --> 00:36:15,199
How about straight
up his ass?

623
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,266
Okay.

624
00:36:16,267 --> 00:36:19,233
I'm sorry, I..

625
00:36:19,234 --> 00:36:20,900
I didn't mean
to snap at you.

626
00:36:20,901 --> 00:36:24,132
It's okay.
No, it's not.

627
00:36:24,133 --> 00:36:27,366
I want to apologize
for the way I treated
you before.

628
00:36:27,367 --> 00:36:32,066
It was completely unfair
to blame you for my..

629
00:36:32,067 --> 00:36:33,566
for my condition.

630
00:36:33,567 --> 00:36:36,099
You risked your life
to save me.

631
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,700
You had no idea
I'd end up like this.

632
00:36:38,701 --> 00:36:40,366
Maybe you would've
acted differently

633
00:36:40,367 --> 00:36:43,999
if you knew I'd never
be able to use another
body part again,

634
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,366
or that I'd have to rely
on people for the rest
of my life

635
00:36:46,367 --> 00:36:49,399
to feed me and clothe me..

636
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,066
and diaper me.

637
00:36:52,067 --> 00:36:55,600
You think you would have?

638
00:36:55,601 --> 00:36:56,833
Would have what?

639
00:36:56,834 --> 00:36:59,167
Acted differently.

640
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,333
Yes.

641
00:37:02,334 --> 00:37:08,099
I knew it, I knew you
were a compassionate man.

642
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,167
That's why you're the only one
that I can ask this favor of.

643
00:37:14,133 --> 00:37:16,767
I want you to finish
what Coleman started.

644
00:37:19,334 --> 00:37:21,700
Bob,

645
00:37:21,701 --> 00:37:24,867
I don't want
to live this way.

646
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:27,801
I can't live like this.

647
00:37:30,634 --> 00:37:35,132
My spirit will die
a million times every day.

648
00:37:35,133 --> 00:37:37,299
If you have any feelings
for me at all,

649
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,833
you'll help me
through it.

650
00:37:39,834 --> 00:37:41,566
Please.

651
00:37:41,567 --> 00:37:44,234
I can't do this anymore.

652
00:37:47,067 --> 00:37:50,400
You're asking me
to end your life?

653
00:37:53,634 --> 00:37:55,601
It's already over.

654
00:37:59,367 --> 00:38:00,900
I get released

655
00:38:00,901 --> 00:38:04,199
to home care
Wednesday at five.

656
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,767
If I don't see you then,
I.. I'll understand.

657
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,700
There you are.
Mr. Shelby.

658
00:38:29,701 --> 00:38:30,833
Sit, sit, sit.

659
00:38:30,834 --> 00:38:32,032
So, did you complete
the assignment?

660
00:38:32,033 --> 00:38:34,032
I delivered it
to her personally.

661
00:38:34,033 --> 00:38:35,366
Excellent.

662
00:38:35,367 --> 00:38:38,766
Did she say anything
when you told her
it was from me?

663
00:38:38,767 --> 00:38:40,099
No.

664
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,701
Did she open it?

665
00:38:44,133 --> 00:38:45,566
Vanessa's a quadriplegic.

666
00:38:45,567 --> 00:38:46,967
She's completely paralyzed.

667
00:38:46,968 --> 00:38:49,166
I know, I know.
I'm sorry.

668
00:38:49,167 --> 00:38:52,800
I'm, uh, just having so much
trouble accepting this.

669
00:38:52,801 --> 00:38:55,032
I had no idea
that losing her

670
00:38:55,033 --> 00:38:57,633
would affect the company
the way it has.

671
00:38:57,634 --> 00:38:59,666
She did more than just
brighten this place up.

672
00:38:59,667 --> 00:39:03,600
She did the little things
that nobody else will.

673
00:39:03,601 --> 00:39:06,933
I feel a little bit
lost without her.

674
00:39:06,934 --> 00:39:08,199
Well, if you..

675
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,600
need any help filling
in the gaps, I can try.

676
00:39:11,601 --> 00:39:14,566
You wouldn't mind?

677
00:39:14,567 --> 00:39:16,666
It might help
with my thinking.

678
00:39:16,667 --> 00:39:18,800
All right, then.

679
00:39:18,801 --> 00:39:22,433
I guess you could
take this over, hah.

680
00:39:22,434 --> 00:39:24,867
It's my wife's latest
attempt to get published.

681
00:39:24,868 --> 00:39:27,399
We need 50 copies of that
by tomorrow to send out.

682
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,333
Oh, and um, when you
finish with that,

683
00:39:30,334 --> 00:39:34,299
could you pick up
these suits at Armine's?

684
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,567
They, um..

685
00:39:37,601 --> 00:39:40,200
close at three.

686
00:39:53,133 --> 00:39:54,466
Bob, Bob.

687
00:39:54,467 --> 00:39:56,466
When are you
coming to see me?

688
00:39:56,467 --> 00:39:58,400
I have to get
these copied.

689
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,633
Uh, can I help you?
I got it.

690
00:40:03,634 --> 00:40:05,299
Hey, have you ever
used this machine?

691
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,566
A copier's a copier.

692
00:40:06,567 --> 00:40:08,299
Ha, look,

693
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:11,900
I know you're the "big hero"
around here, having shot
the bad guy and all,

694
00:40:11,901 --> 00:40:15,066
but operating the 349
isn't as easy as pointing
and pulling a trigger,

695
00:40:15,067 --> 00:40:17,967
you know what
I'm saying, Bob?

696
00:40:17,968 --> 00:40:19,299
These have
to be perfect,

697
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,867
they're for
Mr. Shelby himself.

698
00:40:21,868 --> 00:40:23,266
I'll be gentle.

699
00:40:23,267 --> 00:40:25,199
I hear you've been
looking for me.

700
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,166
Oh.

701
00:40:27,167 --> 00:40:29,366
Quite a night,
wasn't it, hm?

702
00:40:29,367 --> 00:40:32,600
What happened?
You don't remember?

703
00:40:32,601 --> 00:40:35,766
Well, I, uh,

704
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:39,199
I know now why you're
such a quiet man.

705
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,833
Why?

706
00:40:40,834 --> 00:40:43,999
Because you
don't have much
to talk about..

707
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,299
down there.

708
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:48,900
Don't worry, baby.

709
00:40:48,901 --> 00:40:51,601
It'll be our little secret.

710
00:40:59,968 --> 00:41:01,701
It was supposed to be you.

711
00:41:03,968 --> 00:41:08,033
Vanessa Parks is paralyzed
because she looks like you.

712
00:41:10,467 --> 00:41:11,666
What?

713
00:41:11,667 --> 00:41:14,167
Coleman made a mistake.

714
00:41:15,267 --> 00:41:17,868
Okay.

715
00:41:19,133 --> 00:41:22,333
You just dissed
Paula Metzler.

716
00:41:22,334 --> 00:41:24,266
You really are
a bad-ass.

717
00:41:24,267 --> 00:41:27,199
She doesn't know
how lucky she is.

718
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,099
<i>The F.B.I. is now saying</i>

719
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:31,099
<i>sabotage was the cause</i>
<i>of that airliner</i>
<i>losing its wheel,</i>

720
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,666
<i>which resulted</i>
<i>in 12 deaths.</i>

721
00:41:32,667 --> 00:41:34,933
Finish what
Coleman started.

722
00:41:34,934 --> 00:41:37,366
<i>The F.B.I. are also</i>
<i>still piecing together</i>

723
00:41:37,367 --> 00:41:40,700
<i>the possible motive</i>
<i>for Ralf Coleman's</i>
<i>murderous rampage at ADD,</i>

724
00:41:40,701 --> 00:41:43,800
<i>but have so far</i>
<i>made little progress.</i>

725
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:46,766
<i>They also refuse</i>
<i>to link Coleman's actions</i>
<i>to the recent discovery</i>

726
00:41:46,767 --> 00:41:50,099
<i>that his wife and daughter</i>
<i>had died in an auto accident</i>
<i>five years ago,</i>

727
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,533
Finish what
Coleman started.

728
00:41:51,534 --> 00:41:54,233
<i>Saying it was</i>
<i>too long ago to matter.</i>

729
00:41:54,234 --> 00:41:56,166
Listen to them.

730
00:41:56,167 --> 00:41:57,800
Don't those
fucking assholes know

731
00:41:57,801 --> 00:42:00,333
the world
is a shitty place?

732
00:42:00,334 --> 00:42:01,967
Just ask Vanessa.

733
00:42:01,968 --> 00:42:04,466
Shut up!

734
00:42:04,467 --> 00:42:07,467
That poor girl.

735
00:42:44,567 --> 00:42:47,199
Ready to leave?

736
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,634
Mm-hmm.

737
00:43:07,734 --> 00:43:10,667
**

738
00:43:24,701 --> 00:43:27,333
How appropriate,
my old company car.

739
00:43:27,334 --> 00:43:29,132
Yours?

740
00:43:29,133 --> 00:43:32,366
What else did Shelby
give you of mine?

741
00:43:32,367 --> 00:43:34,900
Your office.

742
00:43:34,901 --> 00:43:36,800
I think your job.

743
00:43:36,801 --> 00:43:39,366
Well, whatever you do,
don't sleep with him.

744
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:41,634
I won't.

745
00:43:44,701 --> 00:43:48,567
Okay, let me see
how to do this.

746
00:43:49,667 --> 00:43:52,601
All right?
Yup.

747
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,801
That's it.

748
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,633
This one around
my chest, here,

749
00:44:02,634 --> 00:44:04,199
there's this clip
in the back.

750
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,633
All right.

751
00:44:05,634 --> 00:44:08,767
You going
to be all right,
if I do this?

752
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:24,133
Don't worry,
I won't feel anything
if you touch me.

753
00:44:30,901 --> 00:44:33,000
Okay.

754
00:44:37,133 --> 00:44:38,666
Uh, well, maybe..

755
00:44:38,667 --> 00:44:39,868
maybe not everything.

756
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:45,633
<i>* I will not blink again *</i>

757
00:44:45,634 --> 00:44:49,299
Okay, there you go.

758
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:50,633
Okay.

759
00:44:50,634 --> 00:44:56,633
<i>* You will be sure</i>
<i>as I am *</i>

760
00:44:56,634 --> 00:45:02,634
<i>* That you and I are one *</i>

761
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,433
Now what?

762
00:45:06,434 --> 00:45:08,367
Just get me
out of here.

763
00:45:11,334 --> 00:45:13,500
I've been giving this
a lot of thought,

764
00:45:13,501 --> 00:45:15,800
and I think
I've figured out
a way for you to do this

765
00:45:15,801 --> 00:45:18,166
without getting
any blood on your hands.

766
00:45:18,167 --> 00:45:21,500
The last thing I want
is for you to get into
any trouble over this.

767
00:45:21,501 --> 00:45:24,233
Legally or spiritually.

768
00:45:24,234 --> 00:45:26,233
And I'm not taking
any bullshit pills either.

769
00:45:26,234 --> 00:45:28,700
I'm going out
the same way I came in..

770
00:45:28,701 --> 00:45:31,634
dramatically.

771
00:45:35,033 --> 00:45:36,766
There's a station
on the Red Line,

772
00:45:36,767 --> 00:45:39,833
one where
the South Express
doesn't stop.

773
00:45:39,834 --> 00:45:42,700
The concrete
in the waiting area
is sloped, not very much,

774
00:45:42,701 --> 00:45:44,032
but it's smooth
all the way down.

775
00:45:44,033 --> 00:45:46,166
So, just position me
at the top,

776
00:45:46,167 --> 00:45:47,466
and when we feel
the train coming,

777
00:45:47,467 --> 00:45:50,400
just let me go,
and gravity will take over.

778
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:55,766
What station?

779
00:45:55,767 --> 00:45:57,533
Franklin Street.

780
00:45:57,534 --> 00:45:59,299
The one by
the Crown Superstore?

781
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:00,900
Yeah.

782
00:46:00,901 --> 00:46:03,266
Is it a busy station?

783
00:46:03,267 --> 00:46:05,634
Yeah, but it clears out
at about midnight or so.

784
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:11,032
You hungry? You want
to get something to eat?

785
00:46:11,033 --> 00:46:14,032
Are you asking me
to dinner, Bob?

786
00:46:14,033 --> 00:46:15,634
I guess.

787
00:46:19,033 --> 00:46:20,766
There's a..

788
00:46:20,767 --> 00:46:22,800
Sizzler up here
a little ways.

789
00:46:22,801 --> 00:46:24,967
Sizzler?

790
00:46:24,968 --> 00:46:27,199
Look, Bob, if this
is going to be
my last meal,

791
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,133
I'd like it to be
something special.

792
00:46:31,834 --> 00:46:34,734
I don't get out much,
Sizzler's all I know.

793
00:46:36,501 --> 00:46:39,434
Then this will be a treat
for the both of us.

794
00:46:41,968 --> 00:46:43,299
Right, this way, sir,

795
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,999
we have a lovely table
for you, hidden away
in the back.

796
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,934
Oh.

797
00:46:49,667 --> 00:46:52,066
Six months I've been
trying to get a table here,

798
00:46:52,067 --> 00:46:53,399
you've always been
too crowded?

799
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,766
Well, tonight must be
your lucky night.

800
00:46:55,767 --> 00:46:59,266
Oh, yeah, it's amazing
what a bullet to the spine
will do for your luck.

801
00:46:59,267 --> 00:47:02,234
I should
go out and get
some Quick Picks!

802
00:47:04,467 --> 00:47:07,467
I'm sure you'll have
a wonderful time here
at the restaurant.

803
00:47:10,834 --> 00:47:12,166
Here you are.

804
00:47:12,167 --> 00:47:14,367
Your waiter
will tell you
about the specials.

805
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,867
God, I hate snobs.

806
00:47:17,868 --> 00:47:19,533
Then why eat here?

807
00:47:19,534 --> 00:47:21,933
Because it's
supposed to be
the best in the city,

808
00:47:21,934 --> 00:47:24,132
and I don't want you
to forget this night.

809
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:27,132
I don't think
that'll be a problem.

810
00:47:27,133 --> 00:47:28,867
You're not going to chicken
out on me, are you, Bob?

811
00:47:28,868 --> 00:47:29,967
No.

812
00:47:29,968 --> 00:47:31,233
Because this will
be a wasted meal

813
00:47:31,234 --> 00:47:32,433
if you don't go
through with it.

814
00:47:32,434 --> 00:47:33,733
It's not a wasted meal.

815
00:47:33,734 --> 00:47:36,633
Then stop looking
so goddamn sad.

816
00:47:36,634 --> 00:47:37,999
Sir,

817
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,366
Madam,

818
00:47:39,367 --> 00:47:41,166
would you like
to hear the specials?

819
00:47:41,167 --> 00:47:43,633
Oh, no need, we'll take
the two most expensive
dishes on the menu.

820
00:47:43,634 --> 00:47:45,032
Excellent choice.

821
00:47:45,033 --> 00:47:47,466
I imagine you'd like
a bottle of Opus One
to wash it down?

822
00:47:47,467 --> 00:47:48,867
You read my mind.

823
00:47:48,868 --> 00:47:50,434
I'll bring it
right over.

824
00:47:52,667 --> 00:47:54,600
Don't worry, if you
really have my job,

825
00:47:54,601 --> 00:47:56,400
you can afford it.

826
00:47:57,667 --> 00:47:59,099
Aren't you going
to miss anything?

827
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:00,666
Your friends,
your family..

828
00:48:00,667 --> 00:48:03,766
Bob, how many flowers
were in my room?

829
00:48:03,767 --> 00:48:06,032
I don't remember.
None.

830
00:48:06,033 --> 00:48:08,633
And how many people
came to wish me well?

831
00:48:08,634 --> 00:48:11,666
I don't know.
None.

832
00:48:11,667 --> 00:48:13,266
And who came
to see me today?

833
00:48:13,267 --> 00:48:14,901
The day I got
to go home?

834
00:48:16,734 --> 00:48:18,533
Just me.

835
00:48:18,534 --> 00:48:20,400
Just you.

836
00:48:22,267 --> 00:48:24,933
You're such a beautiful woman,
so full of life, your smile..

837
00:48:24,934 --> 00:48:26,566
Yeah, I could light
up a room, I know,

838
00:48:26,567 --> 00:48:28,433
it's my first
line of offense.

839
00:48:28,434 --> 00:48:29,967
I don't understand.

840
00:48:29,968 --> 00:48:32,700
I'm 26 years old, Bob.
26?

841
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:36,399
Yeah, and I was a heartbeat
away from being Senior VP

842
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:39,766
at a Fortune 500
company in just
one year on the job.

843
00:48:39,767 --> 00:48:41,800
You're an incredibly
educated woman..

844
00:48:41,801 --> 00:48:43,967
No, no I'm not.

845
00:48:43,968 --> 00:48:49,466
My entire extended
schooling is two years
at Valley Junior College.

846
00:48:49,467 --> 00:48:51,867
I have a brain, Bob,
but the only reason why

847
00:48:51,868 --> 00:48:53,600
I got to where I am
so fast is because,

848
00:48:53,601 --> 00:48:55,633
one, I was a complete
knockout, and two,

849
00:48:55,634 --> 00:48:59,233
I gave the best goddamn
blow jobs in the entire state.

850
00:48:59,234 --> 00:49:01,100
Your wine.
Great.

851
00:49:03,367 --> 00:49:07,199
And it didn't hurt
that I also had that whole
woman/child thing going on.

852
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:11,500
Men either wanted to
protect me or fuck me, so,

853
00:49:11,501 --> 00:49:13,666
it helped me get
up the ladder,

854
00:49:13,667 --> 00:49:17,132
and I did a hell of a
lot of climbing, Bob.

855
00:49:17,133 --> 00:49:20,266
More than my share.

856
00:49:20,267 --> 00:49:21,733
Right.

857
00:49:21,734 --> 00:49:24,366
Look, the point is,
you don't make any friends

858
00:49:24,367 --> 00:49:25,968
stepping all over them
on the way up.

859
00:49:28,267 --> 00:49:29,933
Look, enough with
this doom and gloom.

860
00:49:29,934 --> 00:49:32,132
Let's see what a $300 bottle
of wine tastes like.

861
00:49:32,133 --> 00:49:35,934
Me first. Here, can
you take this off?

862
00:49:45,901 --> 00:49:47,033
Ohhh..

863
00:49:49,267 --> 00:49:50,266
Okay?

864
00:49:50,267 --> 00:49:51,967
Yeah.

865
00:49:51,968 --> 00:49:54,032
Don't worry.

866
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:55,801
Ohh..

867
00:49:57,167 --> 00:50:00,066
Whoo..

868
00:50:00,067 --> 00:50:01,801
Ow, that's so
much better.

869
00:50:18,434 --> 00:50:21,567
Now that I'll miss.

870
00:50:23,501 --> 00:50:25,833
<i>Bon appetit.</i>

871
00:50:25,834 --> 00:50:29,166
You have any brothers and
sisters?
Umm.. yeah..

872
00:50:29,167 --> 00:50:32,399
What was your most personal..
I do like apple juice a lot..

873
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,199
Really? One time
at the office I was
talking shit about Paula

874
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,466
Sweet Orchard apple juice..
and she was right behind me.

875
00:50:36,467 --> 00:50:37,534
Oh, Paula..

876
00:50:39,367 --> 00:50:41,266
But are goldfish like cats,

877
00:50:41,267 --> 00:50:44,266
where you can't leave food
out for them?

878
00:50:44,267 --> 00:50:48,333
Pretty much.
Everyone's due for
a good hangover.

879
00:50:48,334 --> 00:50:51,333
It's easier to ask
what hasn't been my most..

880
00:50:51,334 --> 00:50:54,132
You go ahead,
I'm stuffed.

881
00:50:54,133 --> 00:50:56,099
How can you tell?
You can't feel anything
below your neck.

882
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:57,833
I know my limit.

883
00:50:57,834 --> 00:51:00,234
Besides, they're
closing this place
out, I think.

884
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:05,466
It's only
ten o'clock.

885
00:51:05,467 --> 00:51:09,700
I guess we're going to have
to try and find something else
we've never done before.

886
00:51:09,701 --> 00:51:12,199
What haven't you done before?

887
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:15,868
<i>**</i>

888
00:51:18,267 --> 00:51:20,066
You're doing the back-up lines.

889

You hear me?
No..

890
00:51:21,067 --> 00:51:22,266
Yes you are!
No, no, no.

891
00:51:22,267 --> 00:51:24,967
Gladys is nothing
without the Pips.

892
00:51:24,968 --> 00:51:26,734
Take the mic. Bob!

00:52:57,267 --> 00:52:59,967
Oh shit!

923
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:02,300
Bob! Oh my God!

924
00:53:04,434 --> 00:53:06,267
Get me out of here!

925
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:10,033
Thank God I'm not
in a wheelchair.

926
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:24,868
There it is.

927
00:54:03,868 --> 00:54:05,968
Keep going, Bob.

928
00:54:33,701 --> 00:54:35,634
Right here. Stop.

929
00:54:41,601 --> 00:54:43,833
I've been here so many times.

930
00:54:43,834 --> 00:54:47,099
You're going to let go,
you promise?

931
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:48,701
I promise.

932
00:54:50,667 --> 00:54:53,800
I'm glad I got
to know you, Bob.

933
00:54:53,801 --> 00:54:55,367
So am I.

934
00:55:01,934 --> 00:55:03,801
Now Bob. Now.

935
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:32,199
Bob, let me go! Bob!

936
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:35,433
Bob, you promised me!
You fucking promised me!

937
00:55:35,434 --> 00:55:38,967
Goddamn it, Bob!
Let me go.
I'm sorry!

938
00:55:38,968 --> 00:55:42,833
You promised me!
You fucking chickenshit!

939
00:55:42,834 --> 00:55:45,633
You fucking cocksucker!
Let me go!

940
00:55:45,634 --> 00:55:49,000
Bob! Bob! No!
I'm sorry! I know!

941
00:55:57,467 --> 00:56:00,200
Oh, the..
Bob! Shit!

942
00:56:03,133 --> 00:56:06,032
Myelinated actions below
the wound were not as contused

943
00:56:06,033 --> 00:56:08,566
as the original
MRI indicated.

944
00:56:08,567 --> 00:56:12,233
So we rescanned, using
NMR microimaging.

945
00:56:12,234 --> 00:56:14,700
That revealed an overabundance
of progenitor cells,

946
00:56:14,701 --> 00:56:16,166
which apparently caused glia

947
00:56:16,167 --> 00:56:20,166
to be secreted around
the C-7 thoracic synapsis.

948
00:56:20,167 --> 00:56:22,266
What does all
that mean?

949
00:56:22,267 --> 00:56:25,067
It means there's hope.
There's definite hope.

950
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,467
Hi.

951
00:56:39,634 --> 00:56:40,767
Come here.

952
00:56:47,267 --> 00:56:48,734
Closer.

953
00:56:54,767 --> 00:56:55,868
Closer!

954
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,200
Closer.

955
00:57:14,701 --> 00:57:17,600
Thank you for
saving my life.

956
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:18,501
Again.

957
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,234
This time you
won't regret it.

958
00:57:24,667 --> 00:57:28,333
* Inside, outside*

959
00:57:28,334 --> 00:57:32,967
* Make up your mind *

960
00:57:32,968 --> 00:57:35,433
* Put on your face *

961
00:57:35,434 --> 00:57:38,833
* And close your door
Step out of your mind *

962
00:57:38,834 --> 00:57:41,967
isn't anymore, is it?
No, it certainly is not.

963
00:57:41,968 --> 00:57:46,266
* Not another day *

964
00:57:46,267 --> 00:57:50,433
* This one is here
to stay *

965
00:57:50,434 --> 00:57:54,433
* Not another sign *

966
00:57:54,434 --> 00:57:59,466
* You can kiss those blues
of yours goodbye *

967
00:57:59,467 --> 00:58:04,266
* And I said some days
may fade *

968
00:58:04,267 --> 00:58:08,666
* I will let this one fade *

969
00:58:08,667 --> 00:58:12,467
* and sometimes rain falls *

970
00:58:13,601 --> 00:58:17,166
* I will let it fall *

971
00:58:17,167 --> 00:58:21,967
* And some things
are bound to change *

972
00:58:21,968 --> 00:58:25,366
* They will change that way *

973
00:58:25,367 --> 00:58:30,299
* And sometimes
there will be pain *

974
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:33,399
* There won't be any pain *

975
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:36,999
* Not today *

976
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:42,066
* Not this day
This one's all for you *

977
00:58:42,067 --> 00:58:46,233
* Not this day *

978
00:58:46,234 --> 00:58:49,733
* It's your day
This one's all for you *

979
00:58:49,734 --> 00:58:52,968
* It's all for you *

980
00:58:54,634 --> 00:58:56,801
* For you *

981
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:00,267
* It's all for you *

982
00:59:02,968 --> 00:59:05,200
* For you *

983
00:59:06,801 --> 00:59:10,868
**

984
00:59:17,601 --> 00:59:21,166
I told you guys to be here
as soon as possible.

985
00:59:21,167 --> 00:59:24,999
It's an emergency.

986
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,300
Where'd you learn
how to drive? Huh?

987
00:59:31,367 --> 00:59:33,100
**

988
00:59:49,701 --> 00:59:52,399
The big problem's
a lack of communication
between departments,

989
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,299
but I notice there's one place
people don't have any trouble
expressing themselves,

990
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:58,967
and that's by the water cooler,
so I thought if you put
a little miniature water cooler

991
00:59:58,968 --> 01:00:02,834
by every phone in every office
and promote communication
between departments.

992
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:05,933
That's good
thinking, Bob.

993
01:00:05,934 --> 01:00:08,333
Yeah, yeah.

994
01:00:08,334 --> 01:00:13,066
* And I said
some days may fade *

995
01:00:13,067 --> 01:00:16,967
* I will let this one fade *

996
01:00:16,968 --> 01:00:21,633
* Sometimes rain falls *

997
01:00:21,634 --> 01:00:25,466
* And I will let it fall *

998
01:00:25,467 --> 01:00:30,166
* And some things
are bound to change *

999
01:00:30,167 --> 01:00:34,032
* They will change that way *

1000
01:00:34,033 --> 01:00:37,500
* And sometimes
there will be pain *

1001
01:00:37,501 --> 01:00:41,766
* There won't be any pain *

1002
01:00:41,767 --> 01:00:45,933
* Not today *

1003
01:00:45,934 --> 01:00:50,366
* Not this day
This one's all for you *

1004
01:00:50,367 --> 01:00:54,366
* Not today *

1005
01:00:54,367 --> 01:00:58,166
* Not this day
This one's all for you *

1006
01:00:58,167 --> 01:01:02,766
* This is your day *

1007
01:01:02,767 --> 01:01:06,766
* It's your day
This one's all for you *

1008
01:01:06,767 --> 01:01:11,132
* This is your day *

1009
01:01:11,133 --> 01:01:15,066
* It's your day
This one's all for you *

1010
01:01:15,067 --> 01:01:17,968
* It's all for you *

1011
01:01:19,767 --> 01:01:21,801
* For you *

1012
01:01:23,267 --> 01:01:28,199
* It's all for you *

1013
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:30,767
* For you *

1014
01:01:31,901 --> 01:01:37,533
* And I said
Some days may fade *

1015
01:01:37,534 --> 01:01:40,766
* I will let this one fade *

1016
01:01:40,767 --> 01:01:43,400
* Not today *

1017
01:01:55,934 --> 01:01:58,166
I guess we overdid
it today.

1018
01:01:58,167 --> 01:02:02,500
It was a great day.

1019
01:02:02,501 --> 01:02:03,500
But it could
be perfect.

1020
01:02:03,501 --> 01:02:06,367
It's not already?

1021
01:02:08,601 --> 01:02:10,734
It just needs
that final touch.

1022
01:02:13,367 --> 01:02:16,233
Your finger's definitely
getting stronger.

1023
01:02:16,234 --> 01:02:17,934
Take me to the couch.

1024
01:02:44,234 --> 01:02:46,366
I want to satisfy
you, Bob.

1025
01:02:46,367 --> 01:02:48,867
You have.
You are.

1026
01:02:48,868 --> 01:02:53,099
Not intellectually,
I mean intimately.

1027
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:55,633
Sexually.

1028
01:02:55,634 --> 01:02:57,433
All you have to do
is reposition me,

1029
01:02:57,434 --> 01:03:00,833
put my head over the couch,
and I'll do the rest.

1030
01:03:00,834 --> 01:03:05,132
Vanessa!
What? You're my
boyfriend, right?

1031
01:03:05,133 --> 01:03:06,733
Come on, you've done
so much for me.

1032
01:03:06,734 --> 01:03:09,467
Please, just let me
do this for you.

1033
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:14,933
No, no,
I don't think we should.
I don't see you that way.

1034
01:03:14,934 --> 01:03:18,466
Well that's just it.
I want you to. I want
you to find me attractive.

1035
01:03:18,467 --> 01:03:19,934
I do.
You're beautiful.

1036
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:23,533
Not enough to
be intimate with?

1037
01:03:23,534 --> 01:03:25,766
Vanessa,

1038
01:03:25,767 --> 01:03:27,433
from the first moment
I saw you

1039
01:03:27,434 --> 01:03:31,901
I wanted to be close to you
in every way possible.

1040
01:03:33,834 --> 01:03:38,266
I fantasized about you

1041
01:03:38,267 --> 01:03:39,834
being naked.

1042
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:43,367
Can I at least fulfill
that fantasy then?

1043
01:03:47,033 --> 01:03:48,032
Please?

1044
01:03:48,033 --> 01:03:52,433
**

1045
01:03:52,434 --> 01:03:54,767
Buttons, Bob?

1046
01:04:06,467 --> 01:04:07,934
It's okay.

1047
01:04:17,634 --> 01:04:19,167
There's a clasp.

1048
01:04:33,901 --> 01:04:35,801
Touch them.

1049
01:04:36,901 --> 01:04:38,367
But you won't
feel anything.

1050
01:04:39,567 --> 01:04:41,267
I will if you do.

1051
01:04:50,367 --> 01:04:55,701
* So don't you worry at all *

1052
01:04:58,667 --> 01:05:04,167
* And ooh, can't you see *

1053
01:05:07,033 --> 01:05:12,534
* The world's here for you *

1054
01:05:15,667 --> 01:05:21,501
* And ooh, can't you see *

1055
01:05:22,868 --> 01:05:24,868
Take your glasses off.

1056
01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:35,434
Come here.

1057
01:05:43,501 --> 01:05:48,868
* And ooh, can't you see *

1058
01:05:51,767 --> 01:05:57,234
* The world's here for you *

1059
01:05:59,167 --> 01:06:01,634
* I'm here for you *

1060
01:06:03,567 --> 01:06:07,399
* Here for you *

1061
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:09,701
Take me with you.

1062
01:06:12,133 --> 01:06:13,533
What?

1063
01:06:13,534 --> 01:06:15,433
Take me with you.

1064
01:06:15,434 --> 01:06:18,032
Vanessa, it's Monday.
I have to go to work.

1065
01:06:18,033 --> 01:06:20,099
I know. I want
to go with you.

1066
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:21,766
Why?

1067
01:06:21,767 --> 01:06:24,367
Because, it's time to
see where it happened.

1068
01:06:25,868 --> 01:06:29,266
All those people seeing
what's happened to you.

1069
01:06:29,267 --> 01:06:30,633
The ones that you said
you stepped on,

1070
01:06:30,634 --> 01:06:32,767
are you sure you're strong
enough to handle all that?

1071
01:06:36,567 --> 01:06:39,133
I will be
if you're with me.

1072
01:06:46,734 --> 01:06:48,167
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

1073
01:06:51,367 --> 01:06:53,234
Is the lipstick
overdone?

1074
01:06:56,868 --> 01:06:58,733
No, the nurse
did a good job.

1075
01:06:58,734 --> 01:07:00,067
This hair
is in the way.

1076
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:09,900
Let's no do this.
Not today.
No! No no no no no!

1077
01:07:09,901 --> 01:07:13,367
When are you going to learn
to put your emotions away
and just do it?

1078
01:07:17,634 --> 01:07:20,433
Stop! Dammit,
don't do that!

1079
01:07:20,434 --> 01:07:23,267
Don't be weak.
Come here!

1080
01:07:26,033 --> 01:07:28,099
Look at me.

1081
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:30,700
Show some
courage, Bob.

1082
01:07:30,701 --> 01:07:31,868
I need that.

1083
01:07:33,868 --> 01:07:35,767
You're all I got
in there.

1084
01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:05,099
Vanessa. It's really
a shame what happened.

1085
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:07,300
But you look ravishing
as always.

1086
01:08:11,567 --> 01:08:14,267
Such a tragic thing, Vanessa.
If there's anything
I can do, really.

1087
01:08:16,634 --> 01:08:19,167
You okay?
Keep moving.

1088
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:24,032
It smells different.

1089
01:08:24,033 --> 01:08:26,132
They started to pump
in air freshener.

1090
01:08:26,133 --> 01:08:27,766
How come?

1091
01:08:27,767 --> 01:08:30,066
It's supposed to
make you happy.

1092
01:08:30,067 --> 01:08:31,334
It stinks.

1093
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:40,701
Wait, stop.

1094
01:08:45,133 --> 01:08:47,167
I was filling
my water bottle.

1095
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:50,968
Where were you?

1096
01:08:53,133 --> 01:08:55,100
I was over by the hula girl.

1097
01:09:00,634 --> 01:09:02,601
Take me to where I fell.

1098
01:09:25,067 --> 01:09:27,534
I heard the shots, but I didn't
see where they came from.

1099
01:09:30,334 --> 01:09:32,467
Where was Coleman standing?

1100
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:45,099
He was right there.

1101
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:47,166
Show me.

1102
01:09:47,167 --> 01:09:48,701
I wanna see.

1103
01:10:29,834 --> 01:10:31,333
What's wrong?

1104
01:10:31,334 --> 01:10:33,901
I wish I would have
seen his eyes.

1105
01:10:35,434 --> 01:10:37,501
If you had,
he wouldn't have fired.

1106
01:10:39,067 --> 01:10:40,367
How do you know?

1107
01:10:43,667 --> 01:10:44,767
I know.

1108
01:10:47,367 --> 01:10:48,300
Vanessa?

1109
01:10:52,267 --> 01:10:55,566
They told me you were here.
I couldn't believe it.

1110
01:10:55,567 --> 01:10:57,266
I wanted to see
where it happened.

1111
01:10:57,267 --> 01:10:58,767
I understand.

1112
01:11:02,701 --> 01:11:05,967
I am so, so sorry
about what happened.

1113
01:11:05,968 --> 01:11:07,867
Yeah, so am I.

1114
01:11:07,868 --> 01:11:10,501
Bob. Come on. Let's go.
We're done here.

1115
01:11:11,601 --> 01:11:13,700
You can move?

1116
01:11:13,701 --> 01:11:16,199
I-I thought you were
permanently paralyzed.

1117
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:19,967
Yeah, so did I. I guess
we were both wrong.

1118
01:11:19,968 --> 01:11:21,534
Bob.

1119
01:11:26,834 --> 01:11:28,767
It was so good
to see you.

1120
01:11:32,234 --> 01:11:36,033
Freak show's over.
Everyone back to work.

1121
01:11:49,701 --> 01:11:53,833
That's Hawaii, definitely.
Or maybe it's Japan.

1122
01:11:53,834 --> 01:11:55,833
Both would be great.

1123
01:11:55,834 --> 01:11:57,234
God, it would be nice
to go somewhere.

1124
01:12:01,501 --> 01:12:03,701
You're awfully
quiet tonight.

1125
01:12:06,367 --> 01:12:10,233
If you hadn't been shot,
would you ever have thought
of being with me like this?

1126
01:12:10,234 --> 01:12:12,700
That's kind of
a cruel question.

1127
01:12:12,701 --> 01:12:13,967
You wouldn't, I know.

1128
01:12:13,968 --> 01:12:16,132
I didn't even
know you.

1129
01:12:16,133 --> 01:12:18,099
Who would you be
with then?

1130
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:21,032
What does it matter?
We're in a different world.

1131
01:12:21,033 --> 01:12:22,467
Mr. Shelby..

1132
01:12:25,868 --> 01:12:28,333
Did you love him?

1133
01:12:28,334 --> 01:12:30,132
He was married, Bob.

1134
01:12:30,133 --> 01:12:32,833
So?
So I told you
who I was before.

1135
01:12:32,834 --> 01:12:34,733
And why I did
what I did.

1136
01:12:34,734 --> 01:12:37,166
Love was the last
thing on my mind.

1137
01:12:37,167 --> 01:12:39,934
Why are we talking
about this right now?
What happened happened.

1138
01:12:41,801 --> 01:12:44,666
And in this world
I'm with you, you are
the one I want to be with,

1139
01:12:44,667 --> 01:12:47,501
and nothing's going
to change that unless
you want it to change.

1140
01:12:49,234 --> 01:12:53,132
I don't want
anything to change.

1141
01:12:53,133 --> 01:12:55,133
Then it won't.

1142
01:13:21,801 --> 01:13:23,533
Bob,

1143
01:13:23,534 --> 01:13:26,633
you should've told me
you like your women
submissive.

1144
01:13:26,634 --> 01:13:30,166
I would have
accommodated.

1145
01:13:30,167 --> 01:13:32,133
Your day will come.

1146
01:13:38,968 --> 01:13:39,901
Hey Bob.

1147
01:13:42,067 --> 01:13:44,433
What are you doing in here?
We need to talk.

1148
01:13:44,434 --> 01:13:47,099
Don't you ever stop?
I have nothing to say.
I'm fine.

1149
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:48,766
Well, I'm not, okay?

1150
01:13:48,767 --> 01:13:52,066
I'm failing here, Bob,
and I need your help.

1151
01:13:52,067 --> 01:13:55,566
See, I wasn't good enough
to do my job.

1152
01:13:55,567 --> 01:13:57,766
And now I think something
really wrong is going to happen,

1153
01:13:57,767 --> 01:14:01,267
and it's going to be my fault.
What could go wrong?

1154
01:14:03,067 --> 01:14:06,000
Let me show you something.

1155
01:14:07,567 --> 01:14:10,467
All right, Bob.
You gotta see this.

1156
01:14:13,901 --> 01:14:16,067
I haven't shown this
to anybody.

1157
01:14:18,901 --> 01:14:21,100
Sit down.

1158
01:14:35,501 --> 01:14:37,032
Where did you find this?

1159
01:14:37,033 --> 01:14:39,533
In the copy machine.

1160
01:14:39,534 --> 01:14:42,566
You see, the good thing is,
it's in the form of a question.

1161
01:14:42,567 --> 01:14:44,600
That means whoever wrote it

1162
01:14:44,601 --> 01:14:46,834
hasn't made up their mind
what they're going to do yet.

1163
01:14:48,701 --> 01:14:51,366
Maybe they already have,
and they're not
going to do anything.

1164
01:14:51,367 --> 01:14:53,901
Can we take that chance?

1165
01:14:55,501 --> 01:15:00,233
No. The person that wrote
this note is reaching out.

1166
01:15:00,234 --> 01:15:01,800
He may not even know it.

1167
01:15:01,801 --> 01:15:04,633
But that would be
a real tragedy

1168
01:15:04,634 --> 01:15:08,700
if you and I didn't
try to save him.

1169
01:15:08,701 --> 01:15:10,132
How can I save him?

1170
01:15:10,133 --> 01:15:14,100
Help me bring him out
into the open.

1171
01:15:18,667 --> 01:15:20,666
Otherwise, I gotta
go down to Mr. Shelby,

1172
01:15:20,667 --> 01:15:23,600
initiate a company-wide
handwriting analysis

1173
01:15:23,601 --> 01:15:25,800
and, my friend,
that's just a bitch.

1174
01:15:25,801 --> 01:15:28,366
It's just a bitch.

1175
01:15:28,367 --> 01:15:32,533
Oh, shit.

1176
01:15:32,534 --> 01:15:35,534
<i>Bob, you there?</i>

1177
01:15:39,834 --> 01:15:43,766
Ah. I need you to go
out and buy a gift.

1178
01:15:43,767 --> 01:15:47,566
I wanna get something..
something really special,

1179
01:15:47,567 --> 01:15:48,766
but I don't know
what's appropriate

1180
01:15:48,767 --> 01:15:50,833
for someone
in Vanessa's condition

1181
01:15:50,834 --> 01:15:55,700
I figured you would know
what she'd like these days,

1182
01:15:55,701 --> 01:15:58,199
because I certainly
don't know.

1183
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:01,233
I can not get over seeing
her come in like that.

1184
01:16:01,234 --> 01:16:02,933
What a brave woman.

1185
01:16:02,934 --> 01:16:06,434
Here. Take the afternoon
if you need it.

1186
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,867
We.. here.

1187
01:16:10,868 --> 01:16:12,633
What? Do you think
it's not enough?

1188
01:16:12,634 --> 01:16:14,733
I don't think it's right.

1189
01:16:14,734 --> 01:16:16,600
Why not?

1190
01:16:16,601 --> 01:16:18,933
You shouldn't be buying
presents for another woman.

1191
01:16:18,934 --> 01:16:20,533
Vanessa is not
another woman.

1192
01:16:20,534 --> 01:16:24,032
She happens to be a valued
and appreciated member
of the ADD team.

1193
01:16:24,033 --> 01:16:25,500
Is that what you
tell Mrs. Shelby?

1194
01:16:25,501 --> 01:16:27,867
Are you questioning
my fidelity?

1195
01:16:27,868 --> 01:16:30,800
Because if you are,
you are way out of line, pal!

1196
01:16:30,801 --> 01:16:32,466
I just don't wanna see
her hurt again.

1197
01:16:32,467 --> 01:16:33,933
And what are you?
Her protector?

1198
01:16:33,934 --> 01:16:35,032
I care about her.

1199
01:16:35,033 --> 01:16:38,533
Oh, Jesus, you're
in love with her.

1200
01:16:38,534 --> 01:16:41,933
I can't believe it.

1201
01:16:41,934 --> 01:16:44,166
She's done it
to you too.

1202
01:16:44,167 --> 01:16:47,433
Bob, that woman

1203
01:16:47,434 --> 01:16:51,132
will do anything to get a man
to give her what she needs.

1204
01:16:51,133 --> 01:16:52,600
She's changed.

1205
01:16:52,601 --> 01:16:54,999
Yes. She's disabled.

1206
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,666
She doesn't want
anything from me.

1207
01:16:57,667 --> 01:17:00,766
Bob, you're the spoon.

1208
01:17:00,767 --> 01:17:03,600
Because that's what
she needs right now.

1209
01:17:03,601 --> 01:17:05,566
But let me ask
you something.

1210
01:17:05,567 --> 01:17:08,099
What happens if she starts
to wiggle more than her finger?

1211
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:10,233
What if she starts to move
her entire hand?

1212
01:17:10,234 --> 01:17:11,900
Or her arm?

1213
01:17:11,901 --> 01:17:14,166
What happens if she
can feed herself,

1214
01:17:14,167 --> 01:17:15,999
move herself,
take care of herself?

1215
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,233
Do you really think
that a woman like that

1216
01:17:18,234 --> 01:17:20,333
is gonna choose
a man like you?

1217
01:17:20,334 --> 01:17:24,700
I mean, honestly now.

1218
01:17:24,701 --> 01:17:28,166
I..

1219
01:17:28,167 --> 01:17:31,333
am not..

1220
01:17:31,334 --> 01:17:35,534
a spoon.

1221
01:17:50,767 --> 01:17:54,833
There he is.
Man of the people.

1222
01:17:54,834 --> 01:17:58,833
Now this thing between
you and Little Miss
Bottle Rocket serious?

1223
01:17:58,834 --> 01:18:00,333
Don't call her that.

1224
01:18:00,334 --> 01:18:02,933
I'm just saying, Bob,
you're at your peak right now.

1225
01:18:02,934 --> 01:18:05,700
Great money, great car,
great friends.

1226
01:18:05,701 --> 01:18:08,299
Some men wait a whole
lifetime for that.

1227
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:10,334
Why would you wanna
waste it on a gimp?

1228
01:18:11,467 --> 01:18:14,999
You are a very
cruel man!

1229
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,267
Bob, come on. Hey.

1230
01:18:21,467 --> 01:18:23,968
Forget golf on Sunday,
you fucking freak!

1231
01:20:23,534 --> 01:20:26,133
Don't touch her.

1232
01:20:27,634 --> 01:20:29,900
She was mine.

1233
01:20:29,901 --> 01:20:31,733
Well, you threw her away.

1234
01:20:31,734 --> 01:20:34,933
No, I didn't.
She was broken.
She was in pieces.

1235
01:20:34,934 --> 01:20:37,500
She's all better now.

1236
01:20:37,501 --> 01:20:38,633
She was mine.

1237
01:20:38,634 --> 01:20:41,033
Say bye-bye.

1238
01:20:51,267 --> 01:20:53,199
What's this?
He's the guy
you're looking for.

1239
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:54,400
He's the one
with the problem.

1240
01:20:55,968 --> 01:20:58,233
Henry from Maintenance.

1241
01:20:58,234 --> 01:21:00,199
That's your man.

1242
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:03,433
Bob, I think you misunderstood
what I was asking of you.

1243
01:21:03,434 --> 01:21:05,299
No, I didn't.
You wanted me to find
the next Coleman,

1244
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:06,999
that's.. that's
what I did.

1245
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,967
How did you
actually do this?

1246
01:21:08,968 --> 01:21:10,366
I had the sense, remember?

1247
01:21:10,367 --> 01:21:11,867
The sense.

1248
01:21:11,868 --> 01:21:13,933
You know, how
I knew something was
gonna happen here.

1249
01:21:13,934 --> 01:21:16,333
How I knew to bring my gun in
the day Coleman went off.

1250
01:21:16,334 --> 01:21:17,399
Right.
And you're right.

1251
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:18,867
This man is very dangerous.

1252
01:21:18,868 --> 01:21:20,366
You need to do something.
You need to get him some help,

1253
01:21:20,367 --> 01:21:22,299
and you need to get him out
of here, just like you said.

1254
01:21:22,300 --> 01:21:23,566
Bob, he's not the one.

1255
01:21:23,567 --> 01:21:24,933
You didn't see him.
He's this tall!

1256
01:21:24,934 --> 01:21:26,099
You're the one, Bob.

1257
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:28,633
You're the one
that needs help.

1258
01:21:28,634 --> 01:21:32,066
I'm the hero.
I shot the bad guy.

1259
01:21:32,067 --> 01:21:33,800
I know.

1260
01:21:33,801 --> 01:21:36,066
That's why I wanted you
to come to me on your own.

1261
01:21:36,067 --> 01:21:39,333
That's why you're up here
on the top floor.

1262
01:21:39,334 --> 01:21:40,900
You're wrong.

1263
01:21:40,901 --> 01:21:44,099
Think about it.. Vice President
of Creative Thinking?

1264
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:47,600
Do you really believe that
someone like you would
have a job like that?

1265
01:21:47,601 --> 01:21:49,000
Someone like me?

1266
01:21:50,501 --> 01:21:52,399
Just admit you're
the one, Bob,

1267
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:56,067
and you'll be
halfway home.

1268
01:21:59,434 --> 01:22:01,600
No.

1269
01:22:01,601 --> 01:22:02,800
I'm not the one.

1270
01:22:02,801 --> 01:22:05,233
I'm not the one!

1271
01:22:05,234 --> 01:22:06,999
I'm not the one!

1272
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:10,366
I'm not the one!
I'm not!

1273
01:22:10,367 --> 01:22:11,868
Not the one!

1274
01:22:23,834 --> 01:22:25,967
No. No, no, no.

1275
01:22:25,968 --> 01:22:29,399
No!

1276
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:32,868
Let me through!
Let me through!

1277
01:23:18,667 --> 01:23:19,800
Mr. Shelby?

1278
01:23:19,801 --> 01:23:21,132
Hello, Bob.

1279
01:23:21,133 --> 01:23:22,566
What's going on?
Why is he here?

1280
01:23:22,567 --> 01:23:23,700
Well..
I just came..

1281
01:23:23,701 --> 01:23:24,867
I didn't ask you!

1282
01:23:24,868 --> 01:23:27,132
I think you better go.

1283
01:23:27,133 --> 01:23:28,199
Are you sure?

1284
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:30,800
Yeah.

1285
01:23:30,801 --> 01:23:35,032
I, uh.. I'll see you
tomorrow, Bob.

1286
01:23:35,033 --> 01:23:37,300
Right?

1287
01:23:41,601 --> 01:23:43,066
I didn't know that he
was coming over.

1288
01:23:43,067 --> 01:23:44,666
The nurse let him in
before I could stop her.

1289
01:23:44,667 --> 01:23:47,500
He's never come
over here before.
Why here? Why now?

1290
01:23:47,501 --> 01:23:48,900
He wanted to talk.

1291
01:23:48,901 --> 01:23:51,900
About what? About your
miraculous recovery?

1292
01:23:51,901 --> 01:23:54,399
Or how.. how he wants
to ask you back into his life.

1293
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:56,166
Don't do this.
Don't do what?

1294
01:23:56,167 --> 01:23:57,833
Don't turn this into
something it's not.

1295
01:23:57,834 --> 01:23:59,133
Don't tell me
how to feel!

1296
01:24:00,934 --> 01:24:04,099
He came over here because
he was worried about you.

1297
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:06,533
He said that you two
had words earlier

1298
01:24:06,534 --> 01:24:08,433
and that you
left very upset.

1299
01:24:08,434 --> 01:24:10,199
Did he tell you
why I was upset?

1300
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:12,433
How he wanted me to buy you
a present from him? Huh?

1301
01:24:12,434 --> 01:24:14,433
I bet he didn't tell you
a thing about that, did he?

1302
01:24:14,434 --> 01:24:16,600
Yeah, he did.
He also told me that
you harassed Paula

1303
01:24:16,601 --> 01:24:18,333
and that you choked
Harper in the elevator.

1304
01:24:18,334 --> 01:24:20,466
That's 'cause they
disrespected you.

1305
01:24:20,467 --> 01:24:22,466
My God! What is so wrong?

1306
01:24:22,467 --> 01:24:24,099
I'm not the one
who has the problem!

1307
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:26,701
I don't need any help!
I..

1308
01:24:30,801 --> 01:24:32,366
Do I?

1309
01:24:32,367 --> 01:24:34,299
Bob, everybody needs
help sometimes.

1310
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:35,967
There's nothing
wrong with that.

1311
01:24:35,968 --> 01:24:38,500
Look at me.
Without you, I'd either
be hopeless or dead.

1312
01:24:38,501 --> 01:24:40,566
That's because you
need me right now.

1313
01:24:40,567 --> 01:24:42,566
What happens if you
start to get better?

1314
01:24:42,567 --> 01:24:43,933
If you could feed yourself,
clothe yourself,

1315
01:24:43,934 --> 01:24:45,666
take better
care of yourself..

1316
01:24:45,667 --> 01:24:47,666
What're you gonna
do with me then, huh?
Bob, please stop it.

1317
01:24:47,667 --> 01:24:48,867
What're gonna
do with me then?

1318
01:24:48,868 --> 01:24:50,833
You're gonna throw me away.
That's it.

1319
01:24:50,834 --> 01:24:52,600
No, I'm not.
Listen to me.
Yes, you are!

1320
01:24:52,601 --> 01:24:54,766
Yes, you are!
Sit down.
Come here.

1321
01:24:54,767 --> 01:24:57,299
Sit down.
Come here.
No!

1322
01:24:57,300 --> 01:25:00,633
I'm not coming
over there!

1323
01:25:00,634 --> 01:25:04,366
Bob. Sit down.

1324
01:25:04,367 --> 01:25:08,433
Come here
and sit down, now.

1325
01:25:08,434 --> 01:25:10,299
Jesus.

1326
01:25:10,300 --> 01:25:12,867
Listen to me.

1327
01:25:12,868 --> 01:25:15,800
I didn't just find you
in this tragedy.

1328
01:25:15,801 --> 01:25:19,733
I found myself.

1329
01:25:19,734 --> 01:25:21,967
And I can tell you
with all honesty

1330
01:25:21,968 --> 01:25:25,466
that it doesn't matter
if I never walk again
or I can fucking fly.

1331
01:25:25,467 --> 01:25:31,132
It's your heart
and your soul that
I desperately need,

1332
01:25:31,133 --> 01:25:35,433
and I'll always need.

1333
01:25:35,434 --> 01:25:39,634
So you have a problem?
So what?

1334
01:25:41,234 --> 01:25:44,299
I'm gonna help you
get through this.

1335
01:25:44,300 --> 01:25:47,032
You just need the courage
to do the right thing.

1336
01:25:47,033 --> 01:25:49,733
What is the right thing?

1337
01:25:49,734 --> 01:25:53,833
To do what's in your heart.

1338
01:25:53,834 --> 01:25:57,833
And you need the courage
to face that.

1339
01:25:57,834 --> 01:26:01,334
It's easier to find
when I'm with you.

1340
01:26:02,701 --> 01:26:04,700
And if you feel
it's slipping away,

1341
01:26:04,701 --> 01:26:07,901
just look into my eyes..

1342
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:12,901
and it'll be right there.

1343
01:26:30,801 --> 01:26:33,601
Do you love me?

1344
01:26:37,801 --> 01:26:41,733
Bob..

1345
01:26:41,734 --> 01:26:46,000
that's such a foreign word
to me, you know that.

1346
01:26:47,434 --> 01:26:51,166
It doesn't mean
that I won't,

1347
01:26:51,167 --> 01:26:54,033
I just.. I have to be
sure before I say it.

1348
01:26:57,734 --> 01:26:58,900
It doesn't matter.

1349
01:26:58,901 --> 01:27:00,066
Yes, it matters.

1350
01:27:00,067 --> 01:27:01,566
It does matter, Bob!

1351
01:27:01,567 --> 01:27:03,433
Please. Don't go.

1352
01:27:03,434 --> 01:27:07,032
Stay with me
tonight, please.

1353
01:27:07,033 --> 01:27:08,433
Please.

1354
01:27:08,434 --> 01:27:10,199
Why?

1355
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:14,399
Because I'm afraid if you
leave feeling this way..

1356
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:17,534
you won't find
your way back.

1357
01:27:38,834 --> 01:27:42,800
What.. what?

1358
01:27:42,801 --> 01:27:47,333
<i>So, she couldn't say it.</i>
<i>So what?</i>

1359
01:27:47,334 --> 01:27:50,132
<i>It'll come.</i>
<i>It'll happen.</i>

1360
01:27:50,133 --> 01:27:54,900
<i>I just have to be patient.</i>

1361
01:27:54,901 --> 01:27:57,199
<i>'Cause in the end,</i>

1362
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:59,567
<i>it's all about timing.</i>

1363
01:28:56,868 --> 01:29:00,234
The bitch lied.

1364
01:29:22,801 --> 01:29:24,199
Excuse me, sir!

1365
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:25,299
Where's Shelby?

1366
01:29:25,300 --> 01:29:27,667
He's not up here.
He's downstairs.

1367
01:29:44,501 --> 01:29:46,399
Maconel!

1368
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:48,566
Maconel.

1369
01:29:48,567 --> 01:29:53,032
Dammit, I told that
drone not to leave.

1370
01:29:53,033 --> 01:29:55,334
You know where
Maconel went?

1371
01:30:32,033 --> 01:30:33,199
You see that?

1372
01:30:33,200 --> 01:30:36,433
Yeah.

1373
01:30:36,434 --> 01:30:38,667
He's got a gun!

1374
01:30:52,067 --> 01:30:56,634
<i>You're the one, Bob.</i>
<i>You're the one that needs help.</i>

1375
01:31:18,968 --> 01:31:22,266
<i>You may ask why</i>
<i>I did what I did.</i>

1376
01:31:22,267 --> 01:31:26,634
<i>But what choice</i>
<i>did you give me?</i>

1377
01:31:35,701 --> 01:31:39,166
<i>How else could</i>
<i>I get your attention?</i>

1378
01:31:39,167 --> 01:31:43,267
<i>All I wanted was to</i>
<i>exist in your world.</i>

1379
01:31:45,834 --> 01:31:48,500
<i>Just one person</i>

1380
01:31:48,501 --> 01:31:52,567
<i>who took time</i>
<i>to actually see me,</i>

1381
01:31:54,434 --> 01:31:55,367
<i>who helped me..</i>

1382
01:31:57,067 --> 01:31:59,333
<i>find..</i>

1383
01:31:59,334 --> 01:32:02,834
<i>a way out.</i>

1384
01:32:31,901 --> 01:32:34,299
<i>There comes a time</i>

1385
01:32:34,300 --> 01:32:38,066
<i>when the diseased</i>
<i>and the weak</i>

1386
01:32:38,067 --> 01:32:43,133
<i>must be sacrificed</i>
<i>in order to save the herd.</i>

1387
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:51,334
<i>He seemed like a nice guy.</i>

1388
01:32:53,167 --> 01:32:55,767
<i>He was a quiet man.</i>

1389
01:32:57,100 --> 01:33:04,400
