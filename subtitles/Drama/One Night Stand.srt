Almost. Almost.

Oh, that feels good.
Yeah.

00:38:23,921 --> 00:38:25,887
Slower.
Come on, slower.

Oh, yeah. Gentle.

Yeah, that's it.

Ok, harder.

Come on, baby.
I'm almost going to come.

Ohh. Squeeze
my breasts.

the kids. Come on.

Oh, fuck the kids, Max!

Fantastic.

00:39:26,634 --> 00:39:28,133
Mmm.

00:39:29,169 --> 00:39:31,335
How about you?

717
00:39:32,004 --> 00:39:34,103
The best.

Hey, I bought a video.

731
00:40:03,158 --> 00:40:06,592
Yeah?
What kind of video?

732
00:40:07,294 --> 00:40:09,027
Guide to lovemaking.

00:40:09,029 --> 00:40:10,962
Ah.

734
00:40:10,964 --> 00:40:12,229
Yeah, you know, I just thought

735
00:40:12,231 --> 00:40:15,498
maybe we could try
something new.

736
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,532

last night?

Is that a bruise?

745
00:40:28,309 --> 00:40:30,542
It's ink.

746
00:40:31,344 --> 00:40:32,509
Ink?

747
00:40:32,511 --> 00:40:34,077
Ink.

It's from my pen, see?

but I can't right now.

So, how was your trip
to New York?

You're such a bad boy.

775
00:41:50,037 --> 00:41:51,536
I'll tell you what.

776
00:41:51,538 --> 00:41:52,703
The pickle association

777
00:41:52,705 --> 00:41:55,505
doesn't just limit itself
to pickle workers.

778
00:41:55,507 --> 00:41:57,940
No, sir.
Pickles are seasonal,

779
00:41:57,942 --> 00:42:01,009
so we're talking about
an association

780
00:42:01,011 --> 00:42:02,911
that represents the rights

781
00:42:02,912 --> 00:42:04,812
of the pickle and
Sauerkraut workers

782
00:42:04,814 --> 00:42:08,148
of the entire
west coast of America.

783
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,349
What do you say we start off

784
00:42:09,351 --> 00:42:11,284
on the right track here?

785
00:42:11,285 --> 00:42:13,218
Melinda: Nathan has come up
with an awareness campaign

786
00:42:13,221 --> 00:42:15,221
that I think
is pretty interesting.

787
00:42:15,223 --> 00:42:16,223
You know that weather guy

788
00:42:16,224 --> 00:42:18,357
that wears a different
costume every show?

789
00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:20,525
We send him a pickle suit.

790
00:42:20,527 --> 00:42:21,292
Then we send him

791
00:42:21,294 --> 00:42:23,594
a Sauerkraut
and a hot dog suit.

792
00:42:23,596 --> 00:42:25,662
2 suits, 2 shows.

793
00:42:25,664 --> 00:42:29,399
We could try a hot dog
association campaign.

794
00:42:29,401 --> 00:42:31,567
To wed the Sauerkraut
to the dog.

795
00:42:31,569 --> 00:42:35,237
We find the foremost
hot dog maker in the country.

00:42:35,239 --> 00:42:36,304
Gus. Gus bank.

797

George: We get Gus bank
to talk about

798
00:42:38,107 --> 00:42:40,006
how good and
how traditional it is

799
00:42:40,008 --> 00:42:42,541
to have Sauerkraut
with the hot dog.

800
00:42:42,543 --> 00:42:44,576
We piggyback on the dog.

801
00:42:44,578 --> 00:42:45,643
"Everyone loves a dog."

802
00:42:45,645 --> 00:42:48,212
This is a very bad time
for Sauerkraut.

803
00:42:48,214 --> 00:42:51,748
I'm the first to admit it's
not exactly designer food.

804
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:52,782
What we want to try to do

805
00:42:52,784 --> 00:42:54,283
is target the under-21s...

806
00:42:54,285 --> 00:42:55,584
the rock and roll...
the younger folk.

807
00:42:55,586 --> 00:42:59,054
Max is actually going to
be directing the spots.

808
00:42:59,056 --> 00:43:00,021
You saw his show reel,

809
00:43:00,023 --> 00:43:02,256
and you liked it very much.

810
00:43:02,258 --> 00:43:05,125
Max, you want
to toss a few logs

811
00:43:05,127 --> 00:43:07,927
on the campfire here?

812
00:43:08,262 --> 00:43:10,962
The national pickle awards.

813
00:43:10,964 --> 00:43:13,764
And who would get these awards?

814
00:43:13,766 --> 00:43:17,099
Oh, anyone famous
who's in a fix.

815
00:43:18,435 --> 00:43:21,635
The British royal family.

816
00:43:24,006 --> 00:43:26,405
John Wayne bobbitt.

817
00:43:28,409 --> 00:43:31,309
I think you'd probably
like to elucidate

818
00:43:31,311 --> 00:43:33,778
on that a little bit
there, Max.

819
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:36,714
He was caught between...

820
00:43:36,716 --> 00:43:40,451
His bun and his Sauerkraut.

821
00:43:43,956 --> 00:43:46,723
It was no big dill.

822
00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:51,360
Speaking frankly,

823
00:43:51,362 --> 00:43:52,494
I'd rather be caught dead

824
00:43:52,496 --> 00:43:53,661
than put that shit on my reel.

825
00:43:53,663 --> 00:43:55,663
It's not always about art, Max.

826
00:43:55,665 --> 00:43:56,563
Just... just
wait a minute.

827
00:43:56,565 --> 00:43:58,765
Just think about
the company, ok?

828
00:43:58,767 --> 00:44:00,533
What about the profile?

829
00:44:00,535 --> 00:44:02,001
Did we put this hip
little show together

830
00:44:02,003 --> 00:44:04,603
so I could put the green
peen on screen?

831
00:44:04,605 --> 00:44:05,804
I don't think so.

832
00:44:05,805 --> 00:44:07,004
And if it's just about
the fucking numbers,

833
00:44:07,007 --> 00:44:09,340
then fine, you go ahead.
You do that.

834
00:44:09,342 --> 00:44:11,041
I'm out of here.

835
00:44:12,077 --> 00:44:14,143
You know, what
you should be doing

836
00:44:14,145 --> 00:44:16,145
is you should be trying
to keep accounts

837
00:44:16,147 --> 00:44:17,679
like the Armani account.

838
00:44:17,681 --> 00:44:20,615
Now, see, that's impressive.

839
00:44:24,253 --> 00:44:26,519
Fucking pickles.

840
00:44:26,854 --> 00:44:29,855
These are the 2 ladies
from Armani.

I hear you genius.

843
00:44:32,759 --> 00:44:34,525
Ha ha. That's
a good one.

844
00:44:34,527 --> 00:44:36,026
There were supposed to be 50.

845
00:44:36,028 --> 00:44:38,728
Well, there were, but
I couldn't 25 of them

846
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:39,729
to shave their heads.

847
00:44:39,731 --> 00:44:40,763
George, hang on a second.

848
00:44:40,765 --> 00:44:43,732
Give me one second.
Give me one second.

849
00:44:43,734 --> 00:44:45,066
Go pick some more leaves.

850
00:44:45,068 --> 00:44:46,351
Excuse me.

851
00:44:46,352 --> 00:44:47,635
These Armani ladies
are born-again hard

852
00:44:47,637 --> 00:44:49,069
about the nipple thing.

853
00:44:49,071 --> 00:44:49,769
My nipples.

854
00:44:49,771 --> 00:44:50,669
You have wonderful nipples.

855
00:44:50,671 --> 00:44:51,770
These are my nipples,
all right?

856
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:54,506
You're going
to be marvelous, ok?

857
00:44:54,508 --> 00:44:56,124
I'll talk to you soon.

858
00:44:56,125 --> 00:44:57,741
I don't want to talk
to other people, ok?

859
00:44:57,744 --> 00:44:58,943
George: Max,
you can't leave.

860
00:44:58,945 --> 00:45:00,161
Yes. I'm not going
to leave.

861
00:45:00,162 --> 00:45:01,378
Stay in your light.
Stay in your light.

862
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:02,579
This is it.

863
00:45:02,581 --> 00:45:04,080
You're wonderful, really.

864
00:45:04,082 --> 00:45:05,314
Don't patronize me.

865
00:45:05,316 --> 00:45:07,382
I'm a fish-eating
vegetarian, all right?

866
00:45:07,384 --> 00:45:09,384
I've said it 5 times today...

867
00:45:09,386 --> 00:45:10,585
fish-eating vegetarian.

868
00:45:10,587 --> 00:45:12,019
It's not the dress
that makes the woman.

869
00:45:12,021 --> 00:45:13,587
It's the woman
that makes the dress.

870
00:45:13,589 --> 00:45:14,688
Don't you know that already?

871
00:45:14,690 --> 00:45:15,855
What's wrong?
[Crying]

872
00:45:15,857 --> 00:45:17,223
Are you on your period?

873
00:45:17,224 --> 00:45:18,590
I'll come back tomorrow.
I'll do it tomorrow.

874
00:45:18,593 --> 00:45:19,959
I want to go home.

875
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,326
Now, now. You can't
come back tomorrow.

876
00:45:21,329 --> 00:45:23,996
Listen. What they're
really concerned about

877
00:45:23,998 --> 00:45:26,064
is how many
of their $4,000 dresses

878
00:45:26,066 --> 00:45:31,102
are we going to drag through
Potter's field?

879
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:41,911
Max: The next year
was a tough one.

880
00:45:41,913 --> 00:45:44,446
Everything in my life
seemed to be changing

881
00:45:44,448 --> 00:45:45,547
at the same time.

882
00:45:45,549 --> 00:45:49,817
There was nothing I could do
except watch.

883
00:45:52,121 --> 00:45:54,988
It was as if I didn't exist.

884
00:45:55,323 --> 00:45:57,556
I could see myself,

885
00:45:57,558 --> 00:45:59,824
and I could hear myself,

886
00:45:59,826 --> 00:46:05,462
but I was detached
from the whole process.

887
00:46:06,598 --> 00:46:07,897
I love my wife,

888
00:46:07,899 --> 00:46:10,432
I adore my kids,

889
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,200
but...

890
00:46:12,202 --> 00:46:15,002
I wasn't me anymore...

891
00:46:15,471 --> 00:46:17,671
just wasn't me.

892
00:46:17,906 --> 00:46:20,706
What did I miss?
What did I miss, huh?

893
00:46:20,708 --> 00:46:21,707
I was saying that quite frankly

894
00:46:21,709 --> 00:46:24,743
I don't understand
the gay thing, you know?

895
00:46:24,745 --> 00:46:27,045
I know we're all supposed
to be so liberal

896
00:46:27,047 --> 00:46:29,414
out here in California and all,

897
00:46:29,416 --> 00:46:30,448
but, uh...

898
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:32,349
You know, men are not natural

899
00:46:32,351 --> 00:46:34,050
grinding away on each other.

900
00:46:34,052 --> 00:46:35,985
But women,
on the other hand, I think,

901
00:46:35,987 --> 00:46:37,186
are natural.

902
00:46:37,188 --> 00:46:39,922
[Laughter and chatter]

903
00:46:40,958 --> 00:46:43,391
Hey, don, let me ask you
a question.

904
00:46:43,393 --> 00:46:45,293
Yes, sir.

905
00:46:45,294 --> 00:46:47,194
Have you ever kissed
a man before?

906
00:46:47,362 --> 00:46:50,062
No, sir, Max,
I have not kissed a man

907
00:46:50,064 --> 00:46:51,163
in my entire life.

908
00:46:51,165 --> 00:46:52,731
George:
Look at that smile.

909
00:46:52,733 --> 00:46:54,933
[Laughter]

910
00:46:54,935 --> 00:46:56,518
Denial. Denial.

911
00:46:56,519 --> 00:46:58,102
But you do like
anal sex though.

912
00:46:58,104 --> 00:46:59,536
Crowd: Oh.

913
00:46:59,538 --> 00:47:00,703
Well, Max,

914
00:47:00,705 --> 00:47:02,204
given that we both work

915
00:47:02,206 --> 00:47:04,773
in the advertising industry,

916
00:47:04,775 --> 00:47:07,575
I've seen you
kiss asses, and...

917
00:47:07,577 --> 00:47:09,009
[Laughter]

918
00:47:09,011 --> 00:47:11,511
You've seen me kiss asses.

919
00:47:11,513 --> 00:47:13,663
So that's a yes?

920
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:15,814
I guess we have
equanimity in that area.

921
00:47:15,817 --> 00:47:18,250
Woman: Oh. See? See?

922
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:20,018
The steamy question is,

923
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:23,854
have you ever kissed a man?

924
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:25,822
Yeah.

925
00:47:25,824 --> 00:47:27,423
Crowd: Ooh.

926
00:47:27,425 --> 00:47:28,690
[Woman laughs]

927
00:47:28,692 --> 00:47:30,091
Woman:
Get out of here.

928
00:47:30,093 --> 00:47:31,826
Woman: Recently?

929
00:47:31,827 --> 00:47:33,560
Now, does that make me
any less of a man now?

930
00:47:33,563 --> 00:47:35,596
Not in my book.

931
00:47:35,598 --> 00:47:36,997
I guess that's a question

932
00:47:36,999 --> 00:47:41,000
that we should pose
to Mimi, actually.

933
00:47:41,435 --> 00:47:44,769
Gee, where is that coffee?

934
00:47:44,771 --> 00:47:47,371
[Laughter]

935
00:47:48,741 --> 00:47:50,407
Pretty goddamn spectacular

936
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:53,276
to be on safari last year

937
00:47:53,278 --> 00:47:54,610
with Marie in the Congo.

938
00:47:54,612 --> 00:47:56,511
We're there in the middle
of the jungle,

939
00:47:56,513 --> 00:47:59,614
and we could return
to our hotel room,

940
00:47:59,616 --> 00:48:00,615
flip on the telly,

941
00:48:00,617 --> 00:48:02,783
and get CNN and find out
what was happening

942
00:48:02,785 --> 00:48:05,118
in the first
and second worlds. Huh?

943
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:08,087
Mimi: All I know is that
before I book our vacations

944
00:48:08,089 --> 00:48:09,354
in places like that,

945
00:48:09,356 --> 00:48:12,290
I always ask if they,
you know, have CNN.

946
00:48:12,292 --> 00:48:15,326
Marie: Most of
the places have CNN now.

947
00:48:15,328 --> 00:48:18,028
And actually, not only
do they have CNN,

948
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:19,562
they have MTV.

949
00:48:19,564 --> 00:48:20,963
Oh.

950
00:48:20,965 --> 00:48:22,264
Oh, I know.

951
00:48:22,266 --> 00:48:23,331
Marie: I think it is.

952
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:25,666
There are certain shows
that are educational.

953
00:48:25,668 --> 00:48:27,418
Yes.

954
00:48:27,419 --> 00:48:29,169
Television is the worst
fucking thing

955
00:48:29,171 --> 00:48:32,105
that has ever happened
to America.

956
00:48:32,107 --> 00:48:33,973
Woman: What makes you
say that?

957
00:48:33,975 --> 00:48:35,691
You know, you sit there,

958
00:48:35,692 --> 00:48:37,408
and you watch all these
little talk shows...

959
00:48:37,411 --> 00:48:39,310
talk show after talk show.

960
00:48:39,312 --> 00:48:40,944
And you sit there,
and you're entertained

961
00:48:40,946 --> 00:48:44,113
by all these fucked up
dysfunctional people.

962
00:48:44,115 --> 00:48:45,180
And then
they come along with...

963
00:48:45,182 --> 00:48:46,881
Nice little television news

964
00:48:46,883 --> 00:48:48,849
with these 30-second
sound bites.

965
00:48:48,851 --> 00:48:51,985
Throw in a couple of little
human interest stories.

966
00:48:51,987 --> 00:48:53,570
Cute. Nice and cute,

967
00:48:53,571 --> 00:48:55,154
so that all of us won't take
a fucking .45,

968
00:48:55,156 --> 00:48:56,221
put it in my mouth,

969
00:48:56,223 --> 00:48:58,022
and blow our fucking
brains out.

970
00:48:58,024 --> 00:48:59,490
Don't be so dramatic.

971
00:48:59,492 --> 00:49:00,657
Melissa:
Isn't that good, Max?

972
00:49:00,659 --> 00:49:03,993
You want to know
what television really is?

973
00:49:03,995 --> 00:49:06,929
Marie:
It's your paycheck.

974
00:49:06,931 --> 00:49:08,830
Television...

975
00:49:08,832 --> 00:49:10,698
Is a frontal lobotomy.

976
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:13,434
That's what it is.

977
00:49:13,736 --> 00:49:17,136
Let's hear it for
Joseph Lenin's right-hand man

978
00:49:17,138 --> 00:49:19,221
over there,

979
00:49:19,222 --> 00:49:21,305
spouting his poet-warrior
philosophies

980
00:49:21,308 --> 00:49:23,007
about television.

981
00:49:23,009 --> 00:49:25,376
No, thank you.

982
00:49:25,678 --> 00:49:29,413
Dope-smoking,
man-kissing Max, huh?

983
00:49:29,415 --> 00:49:32,783
Hey, tambourine man,
the sixties are over.

984
00:49:32,785 --> 00:49:35,018
[People chatter]

985
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:36,786
You know what, don?

986
00:49:40,124 --> 00:49:42,224
Fuck you.

987
00:49:46,362 --> 00:49:50,230
Mimi: Well,
on that signal...

988
00:49:50,232 --> 00:49:51,798
[Laughs]

989
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,633
Anybody care for dessert?

990
00:49:53,635 --> 00:49:55,635
We've got Bailey's,
haagen-dazs.

991
00:49:55,637 --> 00:49:56,736
Your favorite, don.

992
00:49:56,738 --> 00:49:58,471
Woman:
We've got to go.

993
00:49:58,473 --> 00:50:00,906
We have to go in a moment.

994
00:50:07,547 --> 00:50:10,147
That finished the party off.

995
00:50:10,149 --> 00:50:14,850
I just thought we would
lighten things up a bit,

996
00:50:14,852 --> 00:50:20,054
have a real conversation
for a change, hmm?

997
00:50:22,892 --> 00:50:25,626
I don't think so.

998
00:50:25,961 --> 00:50:27,260
Everybody was having
a really great time

999
00:50:27,262 --> 00:50:28,494
until you decided
to make it serious.

1000
00:50:28,496 --> 00:50:29,962
It's like you have
to let everybody know

1001
00:50:29,964 --> 00:50:32,764
what a deep thinker you are
and how stupid we all are.

1002
00:50:32,766 --> 00:50:33,831
I don't think that's it at all.

1003
00:50:33,833 --> 00:50:36,500
I think that some people
are more interested

1004
00:50:36,502 --> 00:50:37,918
in other things.

1005
00:50:37,919 --> 00:50:39,335
Oh, yeah, like
your assistant, for example.

1006
00:50:39,338 --> 00:50:40,537
Mickey?
What? Come on.

1007
00:50:40,539 --> 00:50:45,108
Oh, she hangs onto
your every word.

1008
00:50:45,543 --> 00:50:48,544
What are you talking about?

1009
00:50:48,546 --> 00:50:49,811
Hmm?

1010
00:50:49,813 --> 00:50:52,246
Are you fucking her?

1011
00:50:52,248 --> 00:50:53,680
What?

1012
00:50:53,682 --> 00:50:55,182
Well, somebody
has to be getting it,

1013
00:50:55,184 --> 00:50:59,685
and it sure as hell ain't me.

1014
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:02,586
She'd like you to fuck her.

1015
00:51:02,588 --> 00:51:04,387
Oh. Oh, really?

1016
00:51:04,389 --> 00:51:06,622
Really. Or what about
Marie, hmm?

1017
00:51:06,624 --> 00:51:08,890
She seemed to find you
fascinating suddenly.

1018
00:51:08,892 --> 00:51:12,560
Well, yeah, yeah,
I am fascinating.

1019
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:14,611
Speaking of Marie,

1020
00:51:14,612 --> 00:51:16,028
maybe Marie does
find me fascinating

1021
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:17,463
because her husband
was sitting there

1022
00:51:17,465 --> 00:51:19,598
looking down your dress
all night.

1023
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:20,865
So now it's the dress?

1024
00:51:20,867 --> 00:51:22,833
Oh, no, I like the dress.

1025
00:51:22,835 --> 00:51:23,767
Great, great.

1026
00:51:23,769 --> 00:51:25,668
No, it's how
you wear the dress.

1027
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:28,871
Well, I think you may be
in the minority there,

1028
00:51:28,873 --> 00:51:30,539
because, to be quite honest,

1029
00:51:30,541 --> 00:51:32,407
it's nice to know that some men

1030
00:51:32,409 --> 00:51:33,775
find me attractive.

1031
00:51:33,777 --> 00:51:35,042
Mimi, come on now.
You are attractive,

1032
00:51:35,044 --> 00:51:37,244
but you just don't have
to expose your breasts

1033
00:51:37,246 --> 00:51:39,246
to be constantly
fucking endorsed.

1034
00:51:39,248 --> 00:51:40,680
That's what I'm saying.

1035
00:51:40,682 --> 00:51:41,947
I...

1036
00:51:41,949 --> 00:51:42,948
I was not...

1037
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:44,482
Did it even dawn on you

1038
00:51:44,484 --> 00:51:46,484
that when you
leaned over the table

1039
00:51:46,486 --> 00:51:49,487
that you are exposing
your fucking breasts?

1040
00:51:49,489 --> 00:51:50,321
Fuck you.

1041
00:51:50,323 --> 00:51:51,388
Did it dawn on you?

1042
00:51:51,390 --> 00:51:53,590
Or is this something
that you work all out?

1043
00:51:53,592 --> 00:51:55,658
Is that it?

1044
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:56,492
Oh.

1045
00:51:56,494 --> 00:51:57,827
You are so...

1046
00:51:57,828 --> 00:51:59,161
Maybe you worked this all out.

1047
00:51:59,163 --> 00:52:02,030
You are just so stoned
out of your mind,

1048
00:52:02,032 --> 00:52:04,599
because you're not
making any sense.

1049
00:52:04,601 --> 00:52:06,034
I'll try.

1050
00:52:06,035 --> 00:52:07,468
I don't know what
you're trying to say.

1051
00:52:07,470 --> 00:52:08,569
Listen, listen.

1052
00:52:08,571 --> 00:52:10,270
Is it possible

1053
00:52:10,272 --> 00:52:11,955
when you go and buy

1054
00:52:11,956 --> 00:52:13,639
those little low-cut
dresses of yours

1055
00:52:13,642 --> 00:52:16,843
that you go there
and you, like...

1056
00:52:16,845 --> 00:52:19,378
Decide on if a lean to the left

1057
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:21,246
or a shade too much...
No.

1058
00:52:21,248 --> 00:52:22,397
Of the left side...

1059
00:52:22,398 --> 00:52:23,547
No, you don't
buy dresses that way.

1060
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:24,782
If you lean to the right,

1061
00:52:24,784 --> 00:52:28,452
then you might show too much
of the little pink area.

1062
00:52:31,423 --> 00:52:32,989
Whoo.

1063
00:53:52,369 --> 00:53:54,569
May I help you, sir?

1064
00:53:54,571 --> 00:53:58,172
Yes. I'm looking for Charlie Rivas.

1065
00:53:58,174 --> 00:54:01,041
He's right over there.

1066
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:02,608
Thank you.

1067
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:04,810
You're welcome.

1068
00:54:19,125 --> 00:54:21,125
Hey, man.

1069
00:54:21,127 --> 00:54:23,093
How you doing?

1070
00:54:40,411 --> 00:54:41,643
[Knock on door]

1071
00:54:41,645 --> 00:54:43,578
Man: Good morning,
Charlie.

1072
00:54:44,981 --> 00:54:47,147
Hi, gentlemen.

1073
00:54:47,415 --> 00:54:49,147
How did you sleep?

1074
00:54:50,850 --> 00:54:52,349
Uh...

1075
00:54:53,485 --> 00:54:54,984
uh...

1076
00:55:06,964 --> 00:55:08,496
ok.

1077
00:55:12,235 --> 00:55:13,434
I'm going to give
Charlie his bath.

1078
00:55:13,436 --> 00:55:17,438
You may prefer to wait outside.

1079
00:55:23,746 --> 00:55:26,580
Hmm. Stick around.

1080
00:55:31,552 --> 00:55:34,019
We got a good sleep last night.

1081
00:55:37,357 --> 00:55:39,457
Man: Max?

1082
00:55:39,992 --> 00:55:41,458
Max.

1083
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:42,992
It's Vernon.

1084
00:55:42,994 --> 00:55:44,727
Charlie's brother.

1085
00:55:45,296 --> 00:55:47,229
Vernon. Oh.

1086
00:55:47,231 --> 00:55:48,630
Hi. How you doing?

1087
00:55:48,632 --> 00:55:51,416
All right.

1088
00:55:51,417 --> 00:55:54,201
Oh, shit. Sorry.
Let's get rid of these.

1089
00:55:55,003 --> 00:55:56,602
Anyway...

1090
00:55:59,807 --> 00:56:03,608
So, how are things going here?

1091
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:06,611
Well...

1092
00:56:06,612 --> 00:56:09,613
The doctor gives him
a week, maybe 2.

1093
00:56:11,650 --> 00:56:13,182
Yeah.

1094
00:56:13,951 --> 00:56:17,785
Hey, I hear things
are going great for you.

1095
00:56:17,787 --> 00:56:19,887
Charlie said business is good.

1096
00:56:19,889 --> 00:56:21,889
Yeah, yeah, things are fine.

1097
00:56:21,891 --> 00:56:24,224
That's nice to hear.
That's good to hear.

1098
00:56:24,226 --> 00:56:26,392
Being in L.A.,
enjoying it out there...

1099
00:56:26,394 --> 00:56:28,127
what a dream that must be.

1100
00:56:28,129 --> 00:56:30,095
I'm doing well.

1101
00:56:30,097 --> 00:56:31,597
Yeah, good.

1102
00:56:31,598 --> 00:56:33,098
That's great.
You meet any stars?

1103
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:34,099
Do you ever...

1104
00:56:34,101 --> 00:56:35,700
Probably not. Well,
that's all right.

1105
00:56:35,702 --> 00:56:37,902
I was trying to think of
the last time I saw you.

1106
00:56:37,904 --> 00:56:41,705
You know, is there
a bathroom around here?

1107
00:56:41,873 --> 00:56:43,205
Uh, yeah, there's one...

1108
00:56:43,207 --> 00:56:45,840
oh, you don't want
to use that one.

1109
00:56:45,842 --> 00:56:47,274
I think it's down on the left.

1110
00:56:47,276 --> 00:56:49,142
Great. Excuse me.

1111
00:56:49,144 --> 00:56:51,144
It's ok.

1112
00:57:06,293 --> 00:57:08,893
Max, how you doing, buddy?

1113
00:57:08,895 --> 00:57:13,830
I'm fine. How are you?

1114
00:57:15,967 --> 00:57:18,133
I'm really tired,

1115
00:57:18,135 --> 00:57:21,669
but I can't sleep.

1116
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:27,507
How long can you stay?

1117
00:57:32,846 --> 00:57:37,414
I know Vern gave you
the skinny, ok?

1118
00:57:37,416 --> 00:57:40,083
I know it, so...

1119
00:57:40,085 --> 00:57:41,418
Yeah.

1120
00:57:41,419 --> 00:57:42,752
Best thing you can do
is just, you know...

1121
00:57:42,754 --> 00:57:45,921
I'll be straight with you,
you be straight with me.

1122
00:57:45,923 --> 00:57:46,655
All right.

1123
00:57:46,657 --> 00:57:48,423
You know what's going on.

1124
00:57:48,425 --> 00:57:50,191
Ok.

1125
00:57:50,426 --> 00:57:53,360
Look, I'm just here
to be useful, all right?

1126
00:57:53,362 --> 00:57:55,595
Anything you want,
you just ask,

1127
00:57:55,597 --> 00:57:57,647
and I'll do it.

1128
00:57:57,648 --> 00:57:59,698
The first thing you can do
is to help me move this pillow,

1129
00:57:59,701 --> 00:58:01,967
turn it around.
This side is wet.

1130
00:58:01,969 --> 00:58:05,070
And pull me over
a little to the left.

1131
00:58:05,072 --> 00:58:05,970
Ok.

1132
00:58:05,972 --> 00:58:08,472
Here we go.

1133
00:58:08,474 --> 00:58:11,407
Sweatin' my skull off.

1134
00:58:12,042 --> 00:58:13,408
How's that?

1135
00:58:13,410 --> 00:58:15,376
Man, such a difference.

1136
00:58:15,378 --> 00:58:16,410
You all right?

1137
00:58:16,412 --> 00:58:18,978
You are sweating.

1138
00:58:19,847 --> 00:58:23,181
Ah...

1139
00:58:23,550 --> 00:58:26,317
[Whispering]
Get me some really good bud.

1140
00:58:26,319 --> 00:58:28,218
[Laughing] I should have known.

1141
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:29,552
It's done.

1142
00:58:29,554 --> 00:58:31,253
Ok.

1143
00:58:32,189 --> 00:58:35,156
Did you come alone?

1144
00:58:35,158 --> 00:58:36,657
Sure.

1145
00:58:36,659 --> 00:58:39,393
Mimi's gonna come
a little bit later on.

1146
00:58:39,395 --> 00:58:40,861
Mimi's coming?

1147
00:58:40,863 --> 00:58:44,081
Yeah.

1148
00:58:44,082 --> 00:58:47,300
Ah. I must be a lot sicker
than I thought.

1149
00:58:51,738 --> 00:58:53,938
Um...

1150
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:55,306
The traffic sucks.

1151
00:58:55,308 --> 00:58:59,910
So by the time that
I want to see the people,

1152
00:58:59,912 --> 00:59:01,177
the people I love,

1153
00:59:01,179 --> 00:59:03,546
they don't get me at my best.

1154
00:59:03,548 --> 00:59:06,615
Sloppy, you know
what I'm saying?

1155
00:59:06,617 --> 00:59:08,917
I need you to manage it
and just...

1156
00:59:08,919 --> 00:59:12,120
You can do it without being
impolite and all that.

1157
00:59:12,122 --> 00:59:14,305
All right.

1158
00:59:14,306 --> 00:59:16,489
What's the best time
I should visit?

1159
00:59:16,492 --> 00:59:18,325
The graveyard.

1160
00:59:18,327 --> 00:59:22,695
Right before dawn.
That's when it's really scary.

1161
00:59:22,697 --> 00:59:26,264
At 5:30, 5:45.

1162
00:59:27,066 --> 00:59:31,168
I shit in my pants
for fear of death.

1163
00:59:31,703 --> 00:59:35,071
Be here then.
It would be nice.

1164
00:59:38,309 --> 00:59:40,676
I'll be here.

1165
00:59:45,048 --> 00:59:48,049
Max: I realized that
he was going to die.

1166
00:59:48,051 --> 00:59:50,317
Course, I had known that
all along,

1167
00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:52,352
but up until that moment,

1168
00:59:52,354 --> 00:59:55,823
it was an abstract idea.

1169
00:59:55,825 --> 00:59:57,090
Now it was reality.

I just have a sixth sense.

1334
01:07:53,619 --> 01:07:55,469
And we sold the house
right before the earthquake.

1335
01:07:55,471 --> 01:07:56,770
You had an intuition.

1336
01:07:56,772 --> 01:07:57,921
Exactly. Right, Max?

1337
01:07:57,922 --> 01:07:59,071
That's a lot of what
real estate is.

1338
01:07:59,074 --> 01:08:02,675
So we sold the house,
at a really good price, too.

1339
01:08:02,677 --> 01:08:04,444
And then the earthquake hit,

1340
01:08:04,446 --> 01:08:06,345
the big northridge earthquake.

1341
01:08:06,347 --> 01:08:07,512
It totaled the house.

1342
01:08:07,514 --> 01:08:09,547
I felt really bad for
the couple who bought it.

1343
01:08:09,549 --> 01:08:11,749
It got totaled during
the earthquake? Yes.

1344
01:08:11,751 --> 01:08:13,016
After you sold it?

1345
01:08:13,018 --> 01:08:14,117
After we sold it.

1346
01:08:14,119 --> 01:08:15,251
Ooh. Oh.
That is beautiful.

1347
01:08:15,253 --> 01:08:17,286
Don't you just love
Japanese food?

1348
01:08:17,288 --> 01:08:18,820
They're so pretty, huh?

1349
01:08:18,822 --> 01:08:21,055
Anyways, the prices of
real estate went down,

1350
01:08:21,057 --> 01:08:23,791
way down, and we
got our new home,

1351
01:08:23,793 --> 01:08:24,591
this beautiful house,

1352
01:08:24,593 --> 01:08:26,159
for, like, what,
half the price?

1353
01:08:26,161 --> 01:08:27,360
It's just gorgeous.

1354
01:08:27,362 --> 01:08:29,095
That's very smart.
That's very smart.

1355
01:08:29,097 --> 01:08:30,830
I think the housing prices
out there

1356
01:08:30,831 --> 01:08:32,564
are at their lowest rate
since before the gold rush.

1357
01:08:32,567 --> 01:08:34,567
Right, right. And then
with the mud slides,

1358
01:08:34,569 --> 01:08:35,801
everybody was afraid to move.

1359
01:08:35,803 --> 01:08:41,806
You know the mud slides
were started intentionally?

1360
01:08:42,542 --> 01:08:43,941
[Vernon chuckles]

1361
01:08:43,943 --> 01:08:44,875
What?

1362
01:08:44,877 --> 01:08:46,376
[Mimi laughing]

1363
01:08:46,378 --> 01:08:48,544
They put all
the fire hoses up there.

1364
01:08:48,546 --> 01:08:50,178
Mimi:
Ok, right, honey.

1365
01:08:50,180 --> 01:08:52,280
So... ha ha ha.

1366
01:08:52,282 --> 01:08:53,581
So dramatic.

1367
01:08:53,583 --> 01:08:56,016
Such a goofball.
So...

1368
01:08:56,018 --> 01:08:57,968
Vernon: We were tempted.

1369
01:08:57,969 --> 01:08:59,919
We were really tempted to
move out there, but, um...

1370
01:08:59,921 --> 01:09:01,186
Well,<i> I</i> was tempted.

1371
01:09:01,188 --> 01:09:04,189
It was a little more
difficult for Karen

1372
01:09:04,191 --> 01:09:05,990
because of her work.

1373
01:09:05,992 --> 01:09:10,026
So, um, what do you do, Karen?

1374
01:09:11,062 --> 01:09:13,862
I'm a rocket scientist.

1375
01:09:17,967 --> 01:09:19,700
Vernon: Uh...

1376
01:09:19,902 --> 01:09:23,370
She... she works for
the Fairchild group.

1377
01:09:23,372 --> 01:09:28,474
It's a company
that design rockets

1378
01:09:28,476 --> 01:09:29,575
for, uh...

1379
01:09:29,577 --> 01:09:31,376
Oh, satellite
communication systems...

1380
01:09:31,378 --> 01:09:32,810
And telephone systems.

1381
01:09:32,812 --> 01:09:36,079
Oh, wow. Really? Hmm.

1382
01:09:36,081 --> 01:09:37,080
Vernon:
But they closed down

1383
01:09:37,082 --> 01:09:39,082
their west coast
division last year,

1384
01:09:39,083 --> 01:09:41,083
so it didn't make any sense
for us to move out, so...

1385
01:09:41,086 --> 01:09:41,818
We're still here.

1386
01:09:41,820 --> 01:09:44,587
So you still live in New York?

1387
01:09:44,589 --> 01:09:45,554
Mm-hmm.

1388
01:09:45,556 --> 01:09:46,254
What part?

1389
01:09:46,256 --> 01:09:47,955
Vernon: Upstate.
Upstate.

1390
01:09:47,957 --> 01:09:49,290
Oh.

1391
01:09:49,291 --> 01:09:50,624
We got a beautiful home
outside of Albany.

1392
01:09:50,626 --> 01:09:54,327
Oh, Albany. Yeah, yeah.
I've heard of Albany.

1393
01:09:54,329 --> 01:09:57,563
Don't we have a friend
in Albany, Max?

1394
01:09:57,565 --> 01:09:59,398
No.

1395
01:09:59,733 --> 01:10:02,433
In fact, we got to be
getting back tomorrow,

1396
01:10:02,435 --> 01:10:03,934
so, I thought, uh...

1397
01:10:03,936 --> 01:10:05,702
Max, if it's all right
with you,

1398
01:10:05,704 --> 01:10:08,604
I'm gonna leave you
a couple of numbers.

1399
01:10:08,606 --> 01:10:10,505
And the cell phone's on here.

1400
01:10:10,507 --> 01:10:12,874
I'm gonna give you
the home in case, uh...

1401
01:10:12,876 --> 01:10:15,109
Anything should
happen with Charlie.

1402
01:10:15,111 --> 01:10:17,778
This must be really,
really difficult for you.

1403
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:19,997
Vernon: What?

1404
01:10:19,998 --> 01:10:22,215
You mean watch my brother die,
not being able to do anything?

1405
01:10:22,217 --> 01:10:23,983
Yeah. It's, uh...

1406
01:10:23,985 --> 01:10:24,917
It's so sad.

1407
01:10:24,919 --> 01:10:28,053
Yep. It is. It sure is,

1408
01:10:28,055 --> 01:10:32,924
but... It's something
to be expected.

1409
01:10:33,693 --> 01:10:36,927
You know, with the lifestyle
these guys lead, it's...

1410
01:10:36,929 --> 01:10:40,497
I mean, you don't watch
someone out playing

1411
01:10:40,499 --> 01:10:41,531
in the middle of a minefield

1412
01:10:41,533 --> 01:10:43,599
and not expect to hear
an explosion, right?

1413
01:10:43,601 --> 01:10:47,869
It just didn't have
to happen to him.

1414
01:10:47,871 --> 01:10:51,072
It's just so stupid.

1415
01:10:51,074 --> 01:10:52,773
Max, I'm glad you're here.

1416
01:10:52,775 --> 01:10:55,742
I know it means
a lot to Charlie.

1417
01:10:55,744 --> 01:10:59,879
Well, it means a lot
to me, too, vern.

1418
01:11:04,218 --> 01:11:06,685
So, what do you say?

1419
01:11:06,687 --> 01:11:10,287
How about a toast to Charlie?

1420
01:11:11,657 --> 01:11:12,455
To Charlie.

1421
01:11:12,457 --> 01:11:13,923
Mimi:
Yes, to Charlie.

1422
01:11:13,925 --> 01:11:14,990
Karen: To Charlie.

1423
01:11:14,992 --> 01:11:17,659
Mimi: Mm-hmm.

1424
01:11:23,699 --> 01:11:25,732
I'm fine.

1425
01:11:26,134 --> 01:11:28,634
Mimi: We should start
digging into this

1426
01:11:28,636 --> 01:11:31,203
before...
It gets what? Warm?

1427
01:11:31,205 --> 01:11:33,405
Ha ha ha ha.

1428
01:11:33,407 --> 01:11:34,272
You get it?

1429
01:11:34,274 --> 01:11:36,540
Oh, anyway, what do you want?

1430
01:11:36,542 --> 01:11:37,908
You want the tuna?

1431
01:11:37,910 --> 01:11:39,910
Vernon:
Hey, cheer me up.

1432
01:11:39,912 --> 01:11:41,544
Surprise me.

1433
01:11:44,081 --> 01:11:45,680
Hey, here we go. Ho.

1434
01:11:45,682 --> 01:11:46,947
Taxi! Hey!

1435
01:11:46,949 --> 01:11:48,715
Oh, we're sorry.
Ha ha ha.

1436
01:11:48,717 --> 01:11:50,850
That's good timing.

1437
01:11:50,852 --> 01:11:51,650
Perfect.

1438
01:11:51,652 --> 01:11:53,418
All right, hey,
this is for you.

1439
01:11:53,420 --> 01:11:55,453
No, no, no. You take it.
You go ahead.

1440
01:11:55,455 --> 01:11:56,353
It's all right.

1441

No, no, no, you go ahead.

No, it's all right.

Look, there's another one.
We'll catch the next one.

1444
01:12:01,159 --> 01:12:01,957
Please.

1445
01:12:01,959 --> 01:12:03,525
It was a good time.

Good to see you.

Good to see you, too, Vern.

Oh, it was a real
pleasure, Vernon.

1449
01:12:08,030 --> 01:12:10,296
We'll have to do it again.

1450
01:12:10,298 --> 01:12:11,063
I hope so.

1451
01:12:11,065 --> 01:12:13,298
Oh, Karen.
Nice to meet you.

1453
01:12:15,068 --> 01:12:17,101
Let me get this.

1454
01:12:20,672 --> 01:12:23,339
Good night.

Hey.

1466
01:14:26,453 --> 01:14:27,552
Ok.

1467
01:14:27,554 --> 01:14:30,721
Because I don't know
what you're talking about.

1468
01:14:30,723 --> 01:14:32,522
So listen and learn.

1469
01:14:32,524 --> 01:14:37,626
Why don't you speak sentences
instead of generalizations?

1470
01:14:37,628 --> 01:14:38,660
You know what?

1471
01:14:38,662 --> 01:14:39,794
No, you know what?

1472

Hey, Max.

01:15:14,494 --> 01:15:15,860
Hey.
It's not much,

1477
01:15:15,862 --> 01:15:18,062
but I brought you
a little something.

1478
01:15:18,064 --> 01:15:19,596
A token of my appreciation

1479
01:15:19,598 --> 01:15:21,598
for what you're
doing for Charlie.

1480

Thank you. Thank you.

She's tired.

1482
01:15:24,969 --> 01:15:27,369
I mean, thank you.

Great. I'm going.

Thanks, mate.

Hi.

1488
01:16:36,637 --> 01:16:38,837
When'd you get back?

1489
01:16:38,839 --> 01:16:41,139
Last night.

1490
01:16:52,151 --> 01:16:54,651
I liked your wife.

She liked you, too.

1492

Really?

1493
01:17:11,667 --> 01:17:14,100
So how is he doing?

1494
01:17:16,270 --> 01:17:18,336
Not so good.

1495
01:17:21,441 --> 01:17:24,375

01:31:52,903 --> 01:31:54,669
I kinda thought
we were dancing.

What are you doing?

1664
01:31:56,139 --> 01:31:57,538
I'm dancing with you.

1665
01:31:57,540 --> 01:32:00,440
You gonna dance with me?

1666
01:32:10,151 --> 01:32:12,384
Wait. Where you going?
Dance with me.

1667
01:32:12,386 --> 01:32:14,586
Whoa, whoa.
Hold it. Whoa, whoa.

1668

Come on. Dance with me.

Max: Please.

1670
01:32:33,071 --> 01:32:34,870
We should stay inside.

1671
01:32:34,872 --> 01:32:36,438
Come on.

1672

there's someone there.

01:33:50,274 --> 01:33:54,142

in the house.

This Internet thing, um,

1683
01:34:42,156 --> 01:34:44,556
it's just all
a new concept to me.

1684
01:34:44,558 --> 01:34:47,191
I was to me
for a long time, too,

1685
01:34:47,193 --> 01:34:48,859
but once you start,
you can't stop.

1686
01:34:48,861 --> 01:34:50,660
I mean, anything
you want to know...

1687
01:34:50,662 --> 01:34:51,761
It just baffles me.

1688
01:34:51,763 --> 01:34:53,863
It's great. And you
get addicted to it.

1689
01:34:53,865 --> 01:34:55,231
I mean, how does it...
you know?

1690
01:34:55,233 --> 01:34:57,466
Yeah, I've been out
of touch for a little bit,

1691
01:34:57,468 --> 01:34:59,668
but that's about where it's at.

1692
01:34:59,670 --> 01:35:00,736
Nice acreage?

1693

Can you grow marijuana?

1695
01:35:02,639 --> 01:35:05,072
You can grow anything you want.

1696
01:35:05,074 --> 01:35:07,274
It just makes me wonder
about people's minds.

1697

What they can come up with.

1698

For me, little ol' me,
I can't conceive of it.

last week.

You wouldn't believe it.

Oh, it's completely different.

1707

They got the gardens
all done over.

kind of nice, overgrown?

Everything...
everything's different.

You don't even
recognize it anymore.

1711
01:35:34,195 --> 01:35:36,462
It so strange, you walk back
to a place that was your own,

1712
01:35:36,464 --> 01:35:38,063
and it's kinda not your own.

Took the porch off.
It was such a nice porch.

1719
01:35:48,072 --> 01:35:49,438

treating them like children.

as it is, honey.

1749

in school anyway.

01:36:58,754 --> 01:37:02,288
I had this weird dream
the other night.

1754
01:37:02,290 --> 01:37:04,256
I was, uh,

1755
01:37:04,258 --> 01:37:06,258
I was in this hotel,

1756
01:37:06,260 --> 01:37:07,392
and, uh, by myself.

1757
01:37:07,394 --> 01:37:09,127
I didn't know where
I was or anything,

1758
01:37:09,129 --> 01:37:12,130
but I was sitting there
and the phone rang.

1759
01:37:12,132 --> 01:37:14,098
So I picked it up,

1760
01:37:14,100 --> 01:37:15,165
and it was Charlie.

1761
01:37:15,167 --> 01:37:18,268
And he says, uh,
"hey, man, how you doing?"

1762
01:37:18,270 --> 01:37:19,936
I said ok.
