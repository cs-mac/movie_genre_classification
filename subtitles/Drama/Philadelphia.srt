{5192}{5294}This "pestilent dust"|has appeared only three times.
{5298}{5461}It was found to be limestone ...|Messy, but innocuous.
{5525}{5600}- Innocuous?|- Harmless.
{5604}{5684}I know what it means. May l?
{5688}{5762}Your Honour ...
{5828}{5909}Imagine how|the neighbourhood children feel.
{5913}{6022}The pounding of construction|ringing in their ears.
{6026}{6141}This skyscraper, a tribute|to mankind's greed, grows daily.
{6146}{6281}It casts a shadow over their lives|and surrounds them with toxic dust.
{6311}{6447}Kendall Construction is rebuilding|this neighbourhood.
{6451}{6613}Granting a restraining order here|will throw 753 people out of work.
{6617}{6747}You cannot validate this groundless|example of rapacious litigation.
{6751}{6886}- It is a threat to our society.|- Let's not go off the deep end.
{6890}{6989}You have made|a compelling case, Mr. Miller.
{6993}{7073}- But there is no irreparable harm.|- Not yet.
{7534}{7661}- Is that you?|- Yeah, it's me.
{7665}{7767}- A client of yours?|- Funny!
{7771}{7869}Excuse me, sir ...
{8522}{8639}I went to a restaurant the other day|and ordered coffee.
{8644}{8772}The waiter asked, "Would you|like sugar or Sweet & Low?"
{8776}{8890}I said, "Do I look like|I should be on a diet?"
{8928}{9004}- Andy.|- Hi, Doc.
{9008}{9133}Your blood work came back.|When I return, we'll discuss it.
{9137}{9214}I'll be right here.
{9244}{9358}- Hi, how are you feeling?|- Pretty good.
{9362}{9460}Make a fist for me.
{9464}{9600}We're gonna have to start|looking for veins in your feet.
{10261}{10364}- Terrific job on the Kendall case.|- Thanks, Kenneth.
{10395}{10510}Anthea, just the paralegal|extraordinaire I was hoping to see.
{10514}{10617}- The answer is no.|- Dinner at Felicia's ...
{10621}{10713}- I've got a class.|- My briefs need proofing.
{10717}{10814}Exploit somebody else.|Since you've asked ...
{10818}{10910}- Your exam!|- 98.
{10915}{10996}98! Congratulations!
{11000}{11143}- Let's talk about the Hansen case.|- Yeah. Thank Amy for the painting.
{11147}{11316}Here are the numbers. The copy's|on your desk. Do you need me?
{11320}{11401}No. It's 6:30. Go home.
{11455}{11574}Hello? Hi, darling.|What a surprise. How are you?
{11578}{11676}- Good.|-what does Dr. Gillman say?
{11680}{11823}She says I am fine.|My blood work is excellent.
{11827}{11977}- How about my platelets?|- Even myplatelets look good.
{11981}{12095}Mom, more importantly,|how are you?
{12147}{12264}- I'm fine. Your dad is fine.|-what are you doing?
{13083}{13211}- Andy, am I interrupting you?|- In a word, Bob.
{13215}{13317}Charles wants to see you upstairs.
{13321}{13463}I was just about to take a break.|You're sure I'm not underdressed?
{13468}{13632}Andy has expressed a keen interest|in Highline versus Sander Systems.
{13636}{13804}- The participants interest me.|- It's an anti-trust action.
{13843}{14032}Is it? Sander Systems copies|Highline's spreadsheet program.
{14036}{14201}For me, the legal principle involved|is copyright infringement.
{14239}{14380}Tell me this, Andy.which side would|you like to see emerge victorious?
{14384}{14555}Don't be influenced by my friendship|with Sander's CEO Billwright.
{14606}{14717}- I'd like to see Highline win.|-why, Beckett?
{14784}{14942}If Sander Systems wins, an energetic|young company is destroyed.
{14947}{15134}Copyright laws were enacted to stop|exactly what Sander are doing.
{15138}{15234}- You know who reps Highline.|- Rodney Bailey.
{15288}{15448}He couldn't find his way around|copyright law with a map.
{15493}{15608}Apparently the fellas|at Highline agree with you.
{15612}{15737}Therefore, as of 9:03 this evening,|right after the dessert course, -
{15741}{15877}- they're now represented by Wyant,|Wheeler, Hellerman, Tetlow & Brown.
{15881}{15960}Outstanding!
{15964}{16104}And more specifically,|senior associate Andrew Beckett.
{16409}{16507}- Thank you, Robert.|- Start on Highline right away.
{16511}{16622}- I'm right on it.|-we have to file within ten days.
{16626}{16729}- Tokyo on line four, Bob.|-walter, thank you.
{16733}{16863}- Thank you, Kenneth.|- Congratulations.
{16867}{16974}-what's that on your forehead?|-where?
{16978}{17050}That, right there on your forehead.
{17054}{17192}I got whacked|with a racquet ball ... Excuse me.
{17282}{17467}Charles ... I sincerely appreciate|your faith in my abilities.
{17471}{17590}Faith is a belief in something|for which we have no evidence.
{17595}{17685}It does not apply in this situation.
{17756}{17879}Go home.|No ... go back to work!
{18083}{18206}- Thank you, Charles.|- No sweat, buddy.
{18850}{18938}Tommy, how are you?
{19655}{19801}The complaintis on my desk, Shelby.|Tell Jamey to get on top ofit
{19806}{19857}Anything else?
{19861}{20007}No, I'll be working out of the house|for the rest of the afternoon.
{20012}{20078}Bye.
{20082}{20220}You want to apply the foundation|as evenly as you can.
{20224}{20393}It shouldn't look like|you threw it on with a spoon.
{20397}{20493}You don't think this|is a little too orange for me?
{20497}{20600}It's Tahitian Bronze.|That works best on these lesions.
{20604}{20764}- Say you've been to Aruba.|- I've called in sick for four days.
{20768}{20841}Now they'll think I was on a cruise.
{20845}{20923}- Fax.|- Thank you, Bruno.
{20927}{21003}We could try this Light Egypt ...
{21007}{21101}-what?|- Andy?
{21148}{21234}Excuse me.
{21353}{21458}Just like my cousin Fredo.
{21590}{21691}Hi ... Does anybody want a bagel?
{22006}{22057}Are you okay, Andy?
{22078}{22195}I need to go to the hospital.
{22947}{23077}- It's all right.|- I'm getting out of here.
{23081}{23196}- One more.|- Thank you for driving me here.
{23201}{23318}I told Dr. Gillman to take a day off|and she took a day off!
{23322}{23485}- Did they take a specimen?|- Blood ... I'm empty.
{23555}{23629}You have a fever, baby.
{23633}{23752}- This is my guy. Excuse me ...|- Just one second.
{23789}{23935}I ran to the bathroom. I almost|lost it in front of everybody.
{23940}{24044}- It's nothing to be ashamed of.|- It's just ...
{24048}{24196}- Any news on my blood work?|- No.we'll do a colonoscopy.
{24331}{24427}- It sounds delightful.|-wait.why do that?
{24431}{24511}-who are you?|-who are you, Doctor ...
{24515}{24593}This is my partner.
{24597}{24722}- He records all my hospital visits.|- I'm Dr. Klenstein.
{24727}{24899}A colonoscopy will show us if it's|the K.S. causing the diarrhoea.
{24903}{25049}- It could be an infection ...|- A reaction to AZT.
{25054}{25122}That's possible ...
{25126}{25232}He's not having this|until we cancel out everything else.
{25236}{25349}I'm trying to help your partner.|You're not a member of his family.
{25353}{25474}- I could have you removed.|- He's upset. He's sorry.
{25478}{25606}- No, don't apologize for me.|- Okay, he's not sorry.
{25610}{25771}Let's see what the blood work|tells us. I'll give a specimen.
{25775}{25898}Maybe we'll hear from Dr. Gillman.|Everybody happy?
{25921}{26042}- I'll check on the blood work.|- Sorry ...
{26104}{26223}- That's the third time.|- Dr. Klenstein ...
{26228}{26324}I have to call the office.|I want you to relax.
{26328}{26459}- I am relaxed.|- Good. Is there a phone around?
{26488}{26677}Ifyou have been injured, you may|be entitled to a cash settlement...
{26682}{26761}Good Lord!
{26766}{26769}- Mr. Beckett's office.|- Shelby, it's me.
{26769}{26853}- Mr. Beckett's office.|- Shelby, it's me.
{26857}{26941}- Jamey beeped me.|- I'm glad you called.
{26945}{27113}It's about the Highline complaint.|Jamey is going ballistic!
{27117}{27244}- Calm down. Put him on.|- One second.
{27248}{27371}-where's the Highline complaint?|-wait! Slow down.
{27376}{27477}It was supposed to be here|this morning.
{27481}{27668}I left it in my office last night.|I put the corrected copy on my desk.
{27672}{27811}- I'm telling you, it's not here.|- All right, try my hard disk.
{27815}{27914}You'll have|to printit outyourself.
{27918}{27997}-what did you file it under?|- HL1.
{28001}{28098}You know that there's|a statute oflimitations on this.
{28102}{28174}It runs out ...
{28178}{28239}... in 75 minutes.
{28298}{28432}- It's not here. Andy.|- It's not there? I'm on myway!
{28474}{28628}Every problem has a solution.
{28772}{28823}Push, baby.
{28910}{29008}It's a girl!
{29101}{29214}- Take a picture, Joe.|- I can't get the film in there.
{29219}{29311}Help me, baby.
{29371}{29481}Look at her. A sweet little ...
{29524}{29625}She's perfect.
{29662}{29771}Go down to the deli.|Get a pound of Scotch salmon.
{29775}{29867}Rolls, bagels ...|Give me a call.

{31462}{31589}The entire street is clear except|for a large hole under construction.
{31593}{31669}It's marked and blocked off.
{31673}{31778}You decide to cross the street|and fall down the hole.
{31782}{31895}- Now you want to sue the city.|- Yes. Do I have a case?
{31899}{31993}- Yeah, of course you do.|- Great.
{31998}{32123}Go with my assistant lris.|Sort out the fee arrangement.

{33022}{33167}-what happened to your face?|- I have AIDS.
{33171}{33255}I'm sorry.
{33366}{33450}- Can I sit down?|- Yeah.
{33666}{33796}Look at this ...|you have a new baby.
{33853}{33935}Yeah, a little baby girl.
{33990}{34167}- "lt's a girl." Congratulations.|- Yeah, one week old.
{34171}{34329}- Kids are great.|- Yeah, I'm real excited about it.
{34405}{34571}-what can I do for you?|- I've been fired by Wyant Wheeler.
{34575}{34674}I want to sue them|for wrongful termination.
{34678}{34772}You want to sue Wyant, Wheeler,|Hellerman, Tetlow & Brown?
{34776}{34915}- Yes. I'm seeking representation.|- Continue.
{34957}{35067}I misplaced an important complaint.|That's their story.
{35071}{35159}Do you want to hear mine?
{35202}{35321}- Have you been to other lawyers?|- Yes, nine.
{35361}{35418}Continue.
{35423}{35559}The night before it was due, I left|a copy of the complaint on my desk.
{35563}{35748}The next day the complaint vanished.|No hard copy.
{35753}{35860}All traces of it mysteriously gone|from my computer.
{35882}{36069}Miraculously, a copywas found|justin time to getit to court
{36073}{36229}But the next day lwas summoned|to a meetingwith the partners.
{36233}{36367}Hello, Andy. Come on in.|Hit the windows.
{36401}{36547}- Thanks. Come on in.|- Hello, everybody.
{36551}{36635}Thanks for coming in.

{36992}{37152}Charles ... I must apologize again|for the Highline mishap yesterday.

{37252}{37357}Thank God that no damage was done.
{37361}{37554}- This time.what about next time?|- There won't be a next time.
{37570}{37711}Something's come over you lately.|I don't know ...
{37715}{37867}- A kind of stupor or fogginess.|- You have an attitude problem.
{37921}{37978}Really?
{37983}{38086}-who thinks that?|- I do.
{38138}{38278}Excuse me ...|Am I being fired?
{38282}{38443}Let me put it this way: Your place|at this firm is no longer secure.
{38447}{38612}It isn't fair to keep you here|when your prospects are limited.
{38617}{38791}- I don't want to rush you ...|-we've got a committee meeting.
{38795}{38939}This is preposterous.|It doesn't make any sense.
{38943}{39042}- You do have an attitude problem.|- Take it easy.
{39046}{39121}Why did you ever give me Highline?
{39125}{39294}You nearly blew the entire case.|It could have been a catastrophe.
{39411}{39482}You concealed your illness.
{39528}{39578}That's correct.
{39639}{39842}Explain it like I'm a two-year-old.|I can't seem to grasp this.
{39846}{39983}Weren't you obliged to tell|your employer you had AIDS?
{39987}{40054}That's not the point.
{40058}{40175}I always served my clients|with absolute excellence.
{40179}{40267}If they hadn't fired me,|I'd still do that.
{40271}{40355}They couldn't fire you|for being sick, -
{40360}{40452}- so they tried|to make you look imcompetent.
{40456}{40527}Correct. I was sabotaged.
{40622}{40695}I don't buy it, counsellor.
{40722}{40843}- That's very disappointing.|- I don't see a case.
{40908}{40986}I have a case.
{40990}{41107}- If you don't want it ...|- That's correct. I don't.
{41166}{41256}Thank you for your time.
{41282}{41353}Mr. Beckett ...
{41489}{41610}I'm sorry about what happened.|It's a bitch.
{41867}{41972}- Have a nice day, Mr. Beckett.|-what's the matter with that guy?
{41976}{42044}Iris, get me Armbruster.
{42048}{42149}I want to see Armbruster|sometime this afternoon.
{42153}{42227}Right away, lris.
{43098}{43207}HIV-virus can only be transmitted|by the exchange of bodily fluids.
{43211}{43323}Blood, semen,|and vaginal secretions.
{43327}{43446}But they're finding out new things|about this disease every day.
{43451}{43541}Today you tell me there's no danger.
{43545}{43645}But six months from now|you may know different.
{43649}{43758}Maybe you can carry it|on your shirt or your clothes.
{43792}{43856}What are you doing?
{43860}{43954}-we're gonna draw blood.|-why?
{43959}{44181}Joe, I've known you a long time.|Your private life is your business.
{44201}{44379}I don't need an AIDS test.|Just send the bill to my office.
{44383}{44467}Thanks for the information.
{44595}{44683}- You have a problem with gays.|- Not especially.
{44688}{44772}- Do you know any gays?|- Do you?
{44777}{44830}- Yes.|-who?
{44835}{44910}Karen Berman. My Aunt Teresa.
{44914}{45037}Cousin Tommy in Rochester.|Eddie Meyers from the office.
{45042}{45169}- Stanley, who fixed the kitchen.|- Aunt Teresa is gay?
{45173}{45276}That beautiful, voluptuous woman|is a lesbian?
{45280}{45421}- Since when?|- Probably since she was born.
{45425}{45566}I admit it, okay. I'm prejudiced.|I don't like homosexuals.
{45570}{45673}The way they do that thing.|Don't they get confused?
{45677}{45749}"ls this yours or mine?"
{45758}{45895}I don't want to be in bed with|anybody who is stronger than me.
{45899}{46033}You can call me old-fashioned|and conservative, but I'm a man.
{46037}{46224}Any man will tell you|how disgusting that whole idea is.
{46228}{46357}- Little cave man of the house.|- You damn skippy.
{46361}{46471}- Stay away from your Aunt Teresa.|- Don't say that to her.
{46475}{46631}Guys trying to be macho|and faggot at the same time.
{46636}{46746}- I'm being totally honest with you.|- Yeah, you are.
{46750}{46896}Would you accept a client|if you were constantly thinking:
{46901}{47037}"l don't want this person|to touch me or even breathe on me?"
{47054}{47177}- Not if I was you, honey.|- Exactly ...what?
{47316}{47394}Merry Christmas.
{47513}{47618}- Thank you.|- Happy New Year.
{47627}{47703}- You're the ...|- TV guy.
{48967}{49043}This is the supplement.
{49047}{49172}You're right. There is a section|on HIV-related discrimination.
{49177}{49285}Thank you very much.
{49496}{49578}We do have|a private research room.
{49583}{49729}- I'm fine right here.|- I'm looking for the Murdoch case.
{49733}{49802}Just a moment.
{50282}{50385}Wouldn't you be more comfortable|in a research room?
{50691}{50826}No ...|would it make you more comfortable?
{50987}{51071}Beckett, how are you doing?
{51199}{51252}Counsellor.
{51546}{51626}Whatever, sir.
{51709}{51782}Excuse me.
{52028}{52157}Who did you get?|Did you find a lawyer?
{52191}{52272}I'm a lawyer.
{52283}{52433}- How's your baby?|- She's ... wonderful.
{52439}{52531}-what's her name?|- Larice.
{52553}{52670}- That's a beautiful name.|-we named her after my sister.
{53598}{53671}Look ...
{53761}{53836}How did they find out you had AIDS?
{53840}{53943}One of the partners|noticed a lesion on my forehead.
{54045}{54133}But how ..?
{54137}{54279}How do you go from that,|which could have been anything, -
{54283}{54462}- to deducing that you had AIDS|and terminating you on that basis?
{54480}{54570}That's a good point.
{54750}{54834}The partner who spotted the lesion,|Walter Kenton, -
{54838}{54937}- worked forwalsh, Ulmer & Brahm|in D.C.
{54941}{55087}A paralegal there, Melissa Benedict,|showed lesions on and off.
{55091}{55183}It was common knowledge|that she had AIDS.
{55187}{55308}- But they didn't fire her.|- No, they did not fire her.
{55313}{55399}Have you got a relevant precedent?
{55403}{55566}The Arline decision ...|Supreme Court.
{55957}{56045}"The Federal Rehabilitation Act|of 1973, -
{56050}{56154}- prohibits discrimination|against handicapped persons -
{56158}{56259}- if they can perform the duties|required of them."
{56263}{56366}"Though the ruling did not specify|AIDS discrimination ..."
{56370}{56483}"... subsequent decisions have held|that AIDS is a handicap -
{56487}{56575}- because of the physical|limitations it imposes -
{56579}{56714}- and the prejudice surrounding it,|which exacts a social death ...
{56799}{56930}... that proceeds|the actual physical one."
{57112}{57189}"This is the essence|of discrimination."
{57193}{57306}"Formulating opinions about others|not based on their merits, -
{57310}{57433}- but on their membership in a group|with the same characteristics."

{58198}{58280}Ken Starr.
{58388}{58464}It'll only take a minute.
{58471}{58600}Charleswheeler. How are you doing?|A summons for you.
{58604}{58709}Take a look at it.|Dr. J., you're the best.
{58713}{58830}If you ever need a lawyer,|just give me a call.
{58834}{58906}See you in court.
{58910}{58977}You're the TV guy.
{59081}{59130}What's up?
{59135}{59247}I want to know everything|about Andy's personal life.
{59251}{59337}Does he frequent|those pathetic bars?
{59341}{59445}What other homosexual facilities|does he go to?
{59449}{59566}What deviant groups|does he secretly belong to?
{59570}{59718}-what is it, Bob?|- Let's make a settlement offer.
{59758}{59895}Andy brought AIDS into our offices,|into our men's room.
{59899}{60007}He brought AIDS|to our annual family picnic!
{60011}{60109}-we ought to be suing him.|- Show some compassion.
{60113}{60177}We gave him Highline.
{60181}{60331}Did Beckett say, "l won't be able to|function to the best of my ability?"
{60335}{60431}Now, discarding the trust|I conferred upon him, -
{60435}{60537}- Andrew Beckett proposes|to haul me into court.
{60541}{60633}To sling accusations at me.|To call me a bigot ...
{60637}{60779}... in full view of the Philadelphia|judicial establishment.
{60938}{61022}Beckett doesn't want to go to court.
{61027}{61150}- Ajury might side with him.|-wait a minute ...
{61154}{61267}He was fired for incompetence,|not because he has AIDS.
{61272}{61402}- Did you know he was sick?|- Did you, Bob?
{61461}{61530}No ... not really.
{61833}{61952}Everybody,|this is the house that I grew up in.
{61956}{62042}Right here in|Lower Merion, Pennsylvania.
{62047}{62126}Here's proof.
{62145}{62262}There. My hand prints|from when I was a cute little boy.
{62266}{62399}Today is the 40th wedding|anniversary of my mom and dad.
{62403}{62575}- A tough life in all that poverty.|- Those can be some mean streets.
{62579}{62716}Here's the front door. I once|broke this finger in this door.
{62737}{62862}-where's my brother?|- There's my sister Jill.
{62867}{62976}- Say hello, Alexis.|- Mommy's pregnant again.
{62980}{63039}Are you really?
{63052}{63113}- Hello, Meghan.|- Uncle Andy.
{63117}{63198}-where's Dad?|- Fixing the snowblower.
{63202}{63300}It snows once in seven years,|and Dad buys a new snowblower.
{63304}{63392}- How are you?|- Today's a good day.
{63396}{63554}Meghan, you're doing a great job.|I've got to say hello to my sisters.
{63805}{63876}Put me down!
{64410}{64514}Parts of the trial|will be hard for you to hear, -
{64518}{64661}- about my personal life.|And there's going to be publicity.
{64665}{64801}- Do you want me to take her?|- No, she's fine.
{64812}{64966}I think it's great you're asking ...|but this is really your call.
{64971}{65039}Thanks, brother.
{65047}{65172}You're my kid brother.|That's all that matters, okay?
{65211}{65330}To be honest,|I'm worried about Mommy and Daddy.
{65335}{65476}They've been through so much, and|there are some tough times ahead.
{65524}{65641}Andy, the way that you've|handled this whole thing ...
{65645}{65760}... you and Miguel ...|with so much courage ...
{65765}{65872}There's nothing|that anybody could say -
{65876}{66014}- that could make us feel anything|but incredibly proud of you.
{66071}{66173}I didn't raise my kids|to sit in the back of the bus.
{66177}{66296}You get in there|and you fight for your rights.
{66300}{66365}I love you guys.
{66994}{67053}Ladies and gentlemen ...
{67098}{67210}Forget everything you've seen|on TV and in the movies.
{67214}{67331}There will be no surprise witnesses|or tearful confessions.
{67336}{67430}You're going to be presented|with a simple fact.
{67460}{67530}Andrew Beckett was fired.
{67534}{67648}You'll hear two explanations|for why he was fired.
{67671}{67773}It is up to you|to sift through the facts -
{67777}{67877}- until you determine|what you think to be the truth.
{67881}{68029}Certain points must be proven.|One: Andrew Beckett was ...
{68034}{68120}... is a brilliant lawyer.
{68124}{68214}Two: Andrew Beckett,|has a debilitating disease.
{68219}{68408}He made the legal choice to keep|this fact from his employers.
{68412}{68577}Three: His employer discovered this.|The illness here is AIDS.
{68581}{68675}Four: They panicked.
{68776}{68870}They did what most of us|would like to do with AIDS.
{68874}{69028}Get it and everybody who has it|as far away from us as possible.
{69072}{69200}Such behaviour may seem reasonable|to you. It does to me.
{69204}{69279}AIDS is an incurable disease.
{69283}{69454}But no matter what moral judgement|you make upon his employers, -
{69458}{69589}- the fact that Beckett was fired|because he had AIDS ...
{69593}{69693}... means they broke the law.
{69801}{69869}Fact:
{69917}{70080}Andrew Beckett's performance|on the job varied from competent ...
{70084}{70184}... to, often times, mediocre ...
{70188}{70298}... to sometimes|flagrantly incompetent.
{70302}{70366}Fact:
{70370}{70485}He claims|he's the victim of lies and deceit.
{70502}{70552}Fact:
{70556}{70727}It was Andrew Beckett who lied|about his disease to his employers.
{70735}{70785}Fact:
{70789}{70921}He was successful in his duplicity.
{70925}{71015}The partners at Wyant Wheeler|did not know -
{71019}{71128}- that Andrew Beckett had AIDS|when they fired him.
{71175}{71259}Fact:
{71263}{71347}Andrew Beckett is dying.
{71460}{71636}Fact:|Andrew Beckett is angry.
{71640}{71845}His lifestyle and reckless behaviour|have cut short his life.
{71853}{71991}In his anger and rage|he is lashing out.
{72008}{72089}He wants someone to pay.
{72171}{72234}Thank you.
{72600}{72704}Andrew Beckett represented|your firm in 1990, is that correct?
{72708}{72809}- That's correct.|-were you pleased with his work?
{72813}{72918}We were satisfied|with the outcome of the litigation.
{72958}{73037}Satisfied.
{73061}{73234}Mr. Laird, you gave me sworn|testimony in your deposition.
{73240}{73326}- Is that correct?|- Correct.
{73331}{73516}You said you were impressed|and delighted with Beckett's work.
{73520}{73586}Do you recall saying that?
{73732}{73898}In all honesty I was delighted|with aspects of Andy's efforts.
{73902}{74048}But in general, I found the work|to be merely satisfactory.
{74203}{74297}Do you agree ...
{74309}{74397}... that a baloney sandwich|is a satisfactory meal?
{74401}{74562}Whereas, caviar and champagne,|roast duck and baked Alaska ...
{74566}{74637}... might be considered delightful?
{74641}{74766}We object. These gastronomical|comments are irrelevant.
{74771}{74919}Five months ago you characterised|Andrew Beckett as caviar.
{74924}{74996}Now he's a baloney sandwich.
{75000}{75142}What powerful force|caused this change of mind?
{75183}{75297}He hasn't changed his mind.|He's amplified his answer.
{75301}{75369}Objection sustained.
{75589}{75702}Mr. Laird, explain this to me|like I'm a four-year-old.
{75706}{75798}Did Andrew Beckett|win your lawsuit for you?
{75813}{75965}- Yes, we won.|- Congratulations.what a ...
{75970}{76048}... satisfactory experience.
{76723}{76784}Ready, Mr. Beckett.
{76940}{77013}Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve!
{77050}{77123}Do you see this|as a gay-rights issue?
{77136}{77224}I am not political.|I just want what is fair.
{77228}{77283}You are gay?
{77287}{77387}That's none ofyourbusiness,|butyes, I am.
{77461}{77540}Do homosexuals|deserve special treatment?.
{77544}{77597}Hell no!
{77602}{77698}Philadelphia|is the city ofbrotherly love.
{77702}{77784}The Declaration oflndependence|was signed here.
{77789}{77840}That documentsays:
{77845}{77964}"All men are created equal. "
{77993}{78072}Give me a break.
{78100}{78261}-we scorn discriminatorypractices.|- Thank you, Mayor.
{78265}{78393}You're not getting a little light|in the sneakers, are you, pal?
{78636}{78751}Yeah, I am, Filko. I'm changing.
{78756}{78817}I'm on the prowl.
{78822}{78937}And I'm looking for a hunk.|A real man ... like you.
{78960}{79054}You know what we do.|You want to play sailor?
{79060}{79139}- Columbus and the first mate.|- That's not funny!
{79143}{79268}These people make me sick ...|but the law's been broken.
{79272}{79354}You remember the law, don't you?
{79464}{79561}- At least we agree on one thing.|-what's that?
{79586}{79676}Tutti-fruttis make me sick, too.
{79804}{79904}Ms. Benedict, you worked|forwalsh, Ulmer & Brahm.
{79908}{80021}- At the same time as Walter Kenton?|- That's correct.
{80025}{80160}He knew the lesions on your face|and arms were caused by AIDS?
{80164}{80241}Definitely, I told all the partners.
{80245}{80345}How did Walter Kenton|treat you after that?
{80349}{80466}Every time we met,|he'd get this look on his face.
{80470}{80608}The "Oh God!" expression. As in,|"Oh God, that woman has AIDS."
{80633}{80713}Thank you. No more questions.
{80722}{80818}Ms. Benedict,|how did you contract AIDS?
{80822}{80918}Through a transfusion|just after childbirth.
{80922}{81054}So it was not your behaviour|which caused you to be infected.
{81058}{81136}You were unable to avoid it.
{81195}{81270}I guess.
{81363}{81413}Thank you.
{81417}{81532}But I don't consider myself|different to anyone else with AIDS.
{81536}{81657}I'm not guilty. I'm not innocent.|I'm just trying to survive.
{81661}{81782}Thank you, Ms. Benedict.|No further questions at this time.
{81810}{81904}You may step down, Ms. Benedict.
{81924}{82072}Apart from the marks on his face,|were there other things -
{82076}{82170}- that made you suspect he had AIDS?
{82175}{82308}He was thin and he seemed tired,|but he was working so hard.
{82312}{82371}Something was wrong.
{82376}{82480}They're trying to pretend|that they didn't notice anything.
{82484}{82588}- Objection.|- Just answer the question.
{82592}{82715}Have you ever felt discriminated|against at Wyant Wheeler?
{82738}{82812}- Yes.|- In what way?
{82816}{82897}Mr.wheeler's secretary Lydia -
{82901}{83008}- said that Mr.wheeler|had a problem with my earrings.
{83012}{83158}Apparently Mr.wheeler felt|that they were too "ethnic".
{83163}{83291}She told me he'd like something|a little less garish ...
{83295}{83445}- Something more "American".|-what did you say?
{83449}{83566}I said, "My earrings are American.|They're African-American."
{83646}{83748}- Let's have order, please.|- No more questions.
{83752}{83871}Ms. Burton,|weren't you recently promoted?
{83875}{83983}Yes, I'm in charge|of the paralegal department.
{84026}{84136}Congratulations on your unfettered|success at Wyant Wheeler.
{84140}{84212}Unfettered?
{84216}{84294}I don't understand this.
{84298}{84450}The promotion of an obviously|intelligent, articulate ...
{84454}{84577}... qualified|African-American woman -
{84581}{84686}- in a firm which practices|wanton discrimination.
{84690}{84825}- That is what's claimed here.|- I can't explain it.
{84829}{84985}Could it be that|these instances of discrimination -
{84990}{85153}- are in fact misunderstandings that|have been blown out of proportion?
{85194}{85299}I think counsel tends|to oversimplify the issue.
{85303}{85451}Thank you, Ms. Burton,|I'll take that into consideration.
{85919}{85974}How's the trial going?
{85978}{86066}I saw you on TV.|I'm a law student at Penn.
{86070}{86177}You saw me on TV?|It's a good school, Penn.
{86181}{86282}I'm in my second year.|I just wanted to tell you -
{86286}{86422}- this case is extremely important.|You're doing a fantastic job.
{86524}{86595}When you graduate, call me.
{86599}{86706}Thank you very much.|Listen, Joe ...
{86727}{86918}-would you like to get a beer?|- No, my wife is ...
{86923}{87042}I don't pick up people|in drug stores every day.
{87219}{87303}- Do you think I'm gay?|- Aren't you?
{87307}{87443}- Do I look gay to you?|- Do I look gay to you?
{87457}{87539}- Relax.|- I ought to kick your faggoty ass.
{87543}{87616}Take it as a compliment.
{87676}{87799}That is exactly the kind of bullshit|that makes people hate your ...
{87803}{87856}... faggoty asses.
{87860}{88008}- You try and kick my ass, asshole.|- No, you're the asshole, buddy!
{88199}{88252}Continue, Ms. O'Hara.
{88257}{88389}We were going crazy|looking for this complaint.
{88393}{88521}Mr. Beckett was screaming.|He looked so freaky.
{88525}{88666}Mr. Kenton kept saying,|"You lost the Highline complaint!"
{88670}{88770}All of a sudden,|Jamey comes in with the complaint.
{88774}{88897}- He says "lt was in Central Files!"|- Central Files?
{88901}{89032}That's where files are sent|when cases are closed.
{89036}{89210}Jamey got to the court just in time.|Everybody was completely wasted.
{89276}{89441}Mr. Beckett just kept saying,|"l'm sorry. I don't understand."
{89459}{89518}Thank you.
{89523}{89595}No further questions.
{89608}{89661}Mr. Miller.
{89832}{89907}- May l?|- Certainly.
{90120}{90177}Thank you.
{90181}{90234}Are you okay?
{90244}{90328}- Do you want a glass of water?|- No.
{90416}{90529}-was Andy a good boss?|- Yes.
{90533}{90607}He was very sweet.
{90634}{90767}How would you characterize|his work as an attorney?
{90772}{90866}How would I know?|I just worked for him.
{90913}{91005}Excuse me, Your Honour,|is this for the record?
{91010}{91139}Mr. Miller, perhaps you should|return to counsel's table.
{91404}{91475}Ms. O'Hara ...
{91479}{91563}Were you aware of any problems -
{91567}{91708}- that the senior partners had|with Andrew's work prior to this?
{91738}{91882}- No, I wasn't.|- Thank you. No more questions.
{92008}{92208}-was Mr. Beckett forgetful?|- Not to my knowledge. No.
{92212}{92337}How would you go about|making a lawyer look incompetent?
{92341}{92427}Hiding an important document|for a few hours?
{92432}{92516}Making it look like|the responsible lawyer misplaced it?
{92521}{92660}Would the partners do that|if they found out Andy was sick?
{92664}{92717}Perhaps.
{92721}{92885}We've had lawyers who've had|heart attacks, ulcers, cancer ...
{92889}{92996}Did you have something to do with|this file being lost accidentally ?
{93000}{93119}- Objection.|- Did you misplace this file?
{93124}{93239}- Absolutely not.|- Are you a homosexual?
{93244}{93357}Answer the question.|Are you a homo? A faggot?
{93361}{93519}You know, a queen? A fairy?|Rump-roaster? Are you gay?
{93523}{93580}Objection!
{93584}{93664}Counsel's attacking his own witness.
{93668}{93801}Mr. Collin's sexual orientation|has nothing to do with this case.
{93812}{93900}Please have a seat, Ms. Conine.
{93962}{94063}Approach the bench, Mr. Miller.
{94309}{94434}Kindly share with me exactly|what's going on in your head.
{94438}{94540}Because I haven't a clue.
{94610}{94700}Your Honour ...
{94705}{94851}Everybody in this room is thinking|about sexual orientation.
{94855}{94932}Sexual preference, whatever.
{94936}{95037}Who does what to whom,|and how they do it.
{95041}{95118}They're thinking|about Andrew Beckett.
{95122}{95214}Mr.wheeler, Ms. Conine,|even you, Your Honour.
{95219}{95285}They're wondering.
{95289}{95437}I know they're thinking about me.|Let's get it out in the open ...
{95441}{95580}... out of the closet.|This case isn't just about AIDS.
{95584}{95689}Let's talk about|what this case is really all about.
{95693}{95825}The general public's loathing,|hatred and fear of homosexuals.
{95829}{95995}And how that hatred translated|into the firing of this homosexual.
{95999}{96103}My client. Andrew Beckett.
{96107}{96197}Please have a seat, Mr. Miller.
{96295}{96348}Very good.
{96352}{96523}In this court, justice is blind|to matters of race, creed, colour, -
{96527}{96602}- and sexual orientation.
{96616}{96702}With all due respect,|Your Honour ...
{96706}{96807}We don't live in this courtroom,|do we?
{96813}{97000}No, but with regard to this witness,|I'll sustain the objection.
{97050}{97182}How many weeks at a time|would you be out to sea?
{97186}{97274}Anywhere from two weeks|to several months.
{97279}{97437}- Any women on board?|- Not when I was in the Navy.
{97450}{97620}During these long voyages,|no women in sight ...
{97624}{97728}Hundreds of hard working,|robust young men in their prime ...
{97732}{97886}At the peak of their|natural appetites and desires ...
{97890}{97982}- Anything going on?|- Like what?
{97986}{98090}Like two sailors down below|making flippy-flop.
{98094}{98159}Objection.
{98172}{98231}There was one.
{98236}{98324}- Objection.|- Continue, Mr. Miller.
{98329}{98426}You mean a homosexual?
{98430}{98576}He strutted around naked|trying to be noticed. It was sick.
{98581}{98727}It was destroying our morale.|We let him know what we thought.
{98731}{98877}- Did you write him a letter?|-we stuck his head in a latrine.
{98881}{99031}You taught him a lesson. Just like|firing Beckett taught him a lesson.
{99036}{99182}- You knew Ms. Benedict had AIDS?|- She didn't try to conceal it.
{99186}{99292}So you know the difference|between a bruise and a lesion?
{99296}{99372}Beckett told me|he'd been hit by a ball.
{99376}{99483}How did hearing of Ms. Benedict's|illness affect you?
{99487}{99628}She said that you were repulsed|by her and avoided her.
{99632}{99782}I feel nothing but the deepest|sympathy for people like Melissa, -
{99786}{99932}- who contracted this disease|through no fault of their own.
{100226}{100304}Andy, don't move now.
{100775}{100880}It's not going through.
{100915}{101017}We may have to flush it out again.
{101121}{101197}The vein's closed.
{101201}{101315}-we'd better call Barbara.|- Nurse Ratchett?
{101319}{101446}Tell her to come over.
{101543}{101689}There's so much stuff|I need to get done.
{101693}{101781}Can't we just skip|treatment for tonight?
{101785}{101887}No, we are not skipping|this treatment.
{101891}{102037}It's my arm and my treatment,|and I say skip it.
{102252}{102321}You know something?
{102325}{102442}- That stuff is saving your life.|-what's the matter with you?
{102446}{102523}- Close the law book.|- Let me ...
{102791}{102906}The least you can do|is look at me -
{102910}{103025}- and give me|a little of your time. Got it?
{103029}{103228}You are worried we don't have|very much time left, aren't you?
{103232}{103291}No.
{103658}{103728}I'll tell you what ...
{103732}{103940}We'll plan my memorial service|and prepare for the inevitable.
{104030}{104122}Maybe you should think about it.
{104547}{104611}No.
{104798}{104904}No ... I've got a better idea.
{105276}{105362}Hi, Andrew. Hi, Miguel.
{105367}{105500}Joe Miller ...|Lisa, nice to meet you!
{105504}{105633}This is Miguel's sister. Maria.
{105682}{105805}-would you like a drink?|- I'll take care of Joe.
{105810}{105993}- You're looking ... alive tonight.|- I had a blood transfusion.
{105998}{106119}Do you like it? I'm a lawsuit.
{106123}{106248}- Not bad.what are you drinking?|-wine is good.
{106253}{106345}Could I have some of the red?
{106357}{106558}- I've got some questions for you.|- I'm at a party right now.
{106562}{106629}We'll get to it later.
{106633}{106703}Hi, Joe Miller.
{106707}{106818}- Do I know you?|- Mona Lisa.
{106822}{106930}- Lawsuit.|- Nice. Have fun.
{109377}{109428}Thank you.
{109652}{109756}- Congratulations, counsellor.|-with what?
{109760}{109908}You survived what I presume to be|your first gay party, intact.
{110008}{110123}When you're brought up|the way most people are, -
{110127}{110279}- there's not a lot of discussion|about homosexuality.
{110295}{110370}As a kid you're taught|that queers are funny.
{110374}{110528}Queers dress up like their mother.|That they're a danger to kids.
{110533}{110671}And that all they want to do|is get into your pants.
{110675}{110808}That pretty much sums up|the general thinking out there.
{110812}{110962}- Thanks for sharing that with me.|- Let's go over this testimony.
{111013}{111086}First, I'll ask you:
{111090}{111219}Can you describe the circumstances|in which you joined Wyant Wheeler?
{111223}{111291}Miller?
{111313}{111411}Do you ever pray?
{111415}{111563}That's not the answer I want.|But, yes, I pray.
{111568}{111718}-what do you pray for?|- I pray that ...
{111723}{111871}I pray that my baby is healthy.|I prayed at her delivery.
{111876}{112006}I pray the Phillies win the pennant.|Now can we get to the questions?
{112010}{112173}Can you describe the circumstances|in which you joined Wyant Wheeler?
{112177}{112329}- Can you do that?|- I may miss the end of this trial.
{112339}{112405}Yes, I've considered that.
{112409}{112550}I've made some provisions in my will|for some charities.
{112554}{112697}- Miguel will need a lawyer.|- I know a good probate.
{112701}{112783}- Thank you.|- You're welcome.
{112787}{112947}Can you describe the circumstances|in which you joined Wyant Wheeler?
{113065}{113135}Do you like opera?
{113235}{113332}I'm not that familiar with opera.
{113393}{113465}This is my favourite aria.
{113486}{113560}This is Maria Callas.
{113585}{113658}This is "Andrea Chenier".
{113687}{113781}Umberto Giordano.
{113820}{113899}This is Madeleine.
{113920}{113993}She's saying how ...
{113997}{114170}... during the French Revolution|a mob set fire to her house.
{114174}{114309}And her mother died ... saving her.
{114313}{114432}"Look, the place that|cradled me is burning."
{114730}{114830}Can you hear|the heartache in her voice?
{114845}{114924}Can you feel it, Joe?
{115062}{115185}In come the strings|and it changes everything.
{115190}{115290}The music fills with a hope.
{115360}{115448}And that'll change again. Listen.
{115516}{115573}Listen.
{115643}{115733}"l bring sorrow|to those who love me."
{115737}{115827}Oh, that single cello.
{116027}{116160}"lt was during this sorrow|that love came to me."
{116320}{116432}"A voice filled with harmony."
{116462}{116560}"lt said, live still."
{116608}{116704}"l am life."
{116720}{116794}"Heaven is in your eyes."
{117826}{117941}"ls everything around you|just the blood and mud?"
{117946}{118032}"l am divine."
{118037}{118131}"l am oblivion."
{118153}{118266}"l am the god ...
{118281}{118441}... that comes down from the heavens|and makes of the earth a heaven."
{118733}{118821}"l am love!"
{118841}{118933}"l am love."
{119363}{119445}I'd better get out of here.
{119468}{119579}Lisa ... I told her that ...
{119629}{119750}- I'll look over the Q & A.|- No, you're ready.
{120650}{120736}Jesus ...
{121334}{121387}God!
{122433}{122519}I love you, little Larice.
{124904}{124973}Left hand on the Bible.
{124977}{125061}Do you swear to tell the truth?
{125065}{125141}- I do.|- Please be seated.
{125223}{125284}Andrew ...
{125288}{125477}Can you describe the circumstances|in which you joined Wyant Wheeler?
{125482}{125597}Wyant Wheeler|aggressively recruited me.
{125602}{125787}The were a very prestigious firm.|I was impressed with the partners.
{125791}{125875}- Including Charleswheeler?|- Particularly Charles.
{125880}{126024}-what impressed you?|- The kind of lawyer he was.
{126028}{126215}-what kind was that?|- One of great legal knowledge.
{126219}{126363}A genuine leader. Gifted at|bringing out the best in others.
{126367}{126525}An awesome ability to illuminate|complex legal problems -
{126530}{126655}- to a colleague, a courtroom,|to the man on the street.
{126659}{126815}The kind of man who can play three|sets of tennis but doesn't sweat.
{126820}{126987}Underneath an elegant surface|he has an adventurous spirit.
{127018}{127154}Did you ever tell Charleswheeler|you were gay?
{127163}{127249}- No, I didn't.|-why not?
{127254}{127377}In a law firm you're not really|supposed to have a personal life.
{127382}{127491}I did plan|to tell Charles eventually.
{127495}{127598}But then something happened|at the racquet club.
{127602}{127686}About three years ago.
{127691}{127790}Somebody started telling jokes.
{127858}{127973}What do you call a woman who|has PMS and ESP at the same time?
{127977}{128092}- I don't know.|- A bitch who knows everything.
{128097}{128169}Sounds like somebody I know.
{128173}{128371}- How does a faggot fake an orgasm?|- He throws hot yogurt on your back.
{128443}{128546}- How did that make you feel?|- Relieved ...
{128550}{128696}... that I never told him I was gay.|Just very relieved.
{128726}{128896}- Are you a good lawyer?|- I'm an excellent lawyer.
{128900}{129013}-what makes you that?|- I love the law.
{129017}{129111}I know the law.|I excel at practicing it.
{129115}{129281}-what do you love about the law?|- Many things.
{129285}{129404}What do I love most about the law?
{129439}{129583}Every now and again,|not often, but occasionally, -
{129588}{129750}- you get to be a part|ofjustice being done.
{129806}{129929}It really is quite a thrill|when that happens.
{130053}{130139}Thank you, Andrew.
{130198}{130362}You said earlier you aspired to be|a person of adventurous spirit.
{130366}{130448}- Is that correct?|- Something like that.
{130452}{130637}- Do you take risks?|- In this job you have to.
{130725}{130829}Did your doctor ever tell you|to reduce stress?
{130833}{131020}That long hours at work|might speed up your illness?
{131037}{131172}My doctor mentioned|the impact AIDS ... Excuse me ...
{131176}{131299}My doctor mentioned the impact|of stress on the immune system.
{131303}{131476}Have you ever been to the|Stallion Showcase Cinema?
{131718}{131804}I've been to ...
{131808}{131874}... that ...
{131878}{132028}I've been to that theatre|three times in my life.
{132033}{132139}-what type of movies do they show?|- Gay movies.
{132143}{132233}- Gay pornographic movies?|- Yes.
{132238}{132318}Objection, Your Honour.
{132322}{132454}This kind of questioning is vital|to the issue of credibility.
{132458}{132552}Let's see where this is going.
{132556}{132607}Continue, counsellor.
{132612}{132776}- Do men have sex there?|- Some men.
{132784}{132881}Have you ever had sex|with anyone in that theatre?
{132885}{132961}- I'm Robert.|- Andy.
{132965}{133051}Yes, once.
{133066}{133183}Approximately what year|did that event take place?
{133235}{133341}I guess it was 1984 ...
{133345}{133420}... 84 or 85.
{133424}{133572}Were you aware in 1984|of the fatal disease called AIDS?
{133576}{133697}And that you could contract it|through sexual activity?
{133702}{133825}I'd heard of something ...
{133853}{133941}The gay plague.|The gay cancer.
{133945}{134115}We didn't know how you could get it|or that it killed you.
{134138}{134234}Do you need a break, Mr. Beckett?
{134238}{134343}No ... I could use some water.
{134347}{134464}John, would you bring|Mr. Beckett some water, please?
{134517}{134638}While you were at Wyant Wheeler,|you did hide the fact -
{134642}{134745}- that you were an active|homosexual, is that correct?
{134749}{134895}No. That's not correct.|I never lied about it.
{135043}{135228}As a homosexual, one is often|forced to conceal one's sexuality.
{135232}{135343}- Isn't that right?|- In some circumstances, yes.
{135347}{135493}You have spent your life pretending|to be something that you're not.
{135497}{135616}- Concealment and dishonesty ...|- I object.
{135621}{135686}I'll withdraw it.
{135690}{135879}Were you living with|Miguel Alvarez in 1984, -
{135884}{135947}- when you had your ...
{135951}{136083}... anonymous sexual encounter|in the porn theatre?
{136087}{136138}Yes.
{136162}{136328}- So you could have infected him?|- Miguel has not been infected.
{136332}{136490}You didn't answer my question.|Could you have infected him?
{136572}{136625}Yes.
{136630}{136794}You say the lesions on your face|were clearly visible.
{136798}{136849}That's right.
{136854}{136956}Is it your contention that when|the partners saw these lesions, -
{136960}{137095}- they leapt to the conclusion|you had AIDS and they fired you?
{137129}{137223}As painful as it is ...
{137227}{137387}... to accuse my colleagues|of such reprehensible behaviour ...
{137391}{137499}... it is the only conclusion|I could come to.
{137503}{137611}Do you have any lesions on your face|at this time?
{137625}{137785}One, here ... by my ear.
{137811}{137930}- May I approach the witness?|- Yes, you may.
{138197}{138308}Remembering that you're under oath,|answering truthfully ...
{138312}{138450}Can you see the lesions on your face|in this mirror from three feet away?
{138454}{138555}Answering truthfully.
{138748}{138865}At the time I was fired,|the lesions were much bigger.
{138870}{138980}Answer my question, please.
{139041}{139168}No, I can't really see them.
{139216}{139313}No more questions.
{139318}{139431}We'll take a break now.|We'll reconvene in the morning.
{139435}{139492}I hate this case.
{139497}{139684}- I'd like five minutes in redirect.|- Mr. Beckett, can you go on?
{139689}{139755}Three minutes.
{139759}{139849}May I borrow your mirror, please?
{139859}{139931}Andrew ...
{139980}{140076}Do you have any lesions|on your body -
{140080}{140228}- that resemble the lesions you had|on your face when you were fired?
{140232}{140340}Yes, on my torso.
{140344}{140461}I would like to ask Andrew|to remove his shirt -
{140466}{140554}- so we can all|see what we're talking about.
{140558}{140666}Objection. It would|unfairly influence the jury.
{140670}{140770}If Andrew's illness forced him|to use a wheelchair, -
{140774}{140893}- would he have to park it outside|so as not to influence the jury?
{140897}{141004}This is AIDS.|Let's see what we're talking about.
{141008}{141164}I'll allow it.|Please remove your shirt.
{141403}{141557}- God, what a nightmare.|- He asked for it.
{142547}{142740}- Can you see these lesions?|- Yes.
{142771}{142835}Thank you.
{143063}{143173}- Do you swear to tell the truth?|- I do.
{143177}{143251}Please be seated.
{143428}{143558}Mr.wheeler, were you aware|that Andrew Beckett had AIDS -
{143562}{143670}- at the time of his departure|from Wyant Wheeler?
{143674}{143753}- No.|- For absolute clarity ...
{143757}{143887}Did you fire Andrew Beckett|because he had AIDS?
{143891}{144002}No, I did not fire Andrew Beckett|because he had AIDS.
{144010}{144125}Can you explain in a way|that leaves no doubt -
{144130}{144253}- why you promoted|Andrew Beckett in your firm?
{144258}{144410}And then, most importantly,|why you asked him to leave?
{144471}{144627}If you're the owner of a ball club,|you recruit the hot rookie.
{144632}{144868}Andy was tremendously promising.|Fresh out of Penn. Crackerjack.
{144872}{145067}That's why we hired him,|and why we stuck by him for so long.
{145073}{145221}Why did you give him|all this opportunity?
{145225}{145353}When you've groomed someone|the way we groomed Andy, -
{145357}{145496}- nurturing him and lavishing|special treatment on him, -
{145500}{145565}- it's quite an investment.
{145569}{145655}We were waiting for the promise|to deliver.
{145660}{145853}But ultimately, we could not ignore|the gap between reality and promise.
{146013}{146099}Thank you, Mr.wheeler.
{146112}{146231}No more questions, Your Honour.
{146291}{146428}- Objection, Your Honour.|- All right, Mr. Miller.
{146432}{146531}Mr.wheeler, you are magnificent.
{146535}{146656}You are my hero. Andrew's right.|You are the greatest.
{146661}{146720}Are you gay?
{146737}{146813}Objection.
{146830}{146958}- How dare you!|- The witness will kindly answer.
{147002}{147096}No, I am not a homosexual.
{147100}{147233}Isn't it true that when you realized|your future senior partner was gay -
{147237}{147403}- and had AIDS, it drove fear right|through your heterosexual heart?
{147407}{147524}Remembering the hugs|and the handshakes. The sauna.
{147529}{147640}The friendly pats on the backside|that guys exchange sometimes.
{147644}{147783}It made you say, "My God!|What does this say about me?"
{147787}{147869}Objection.
{147892}{147994}The witness will please|respond to the question.
{147998}{148161}Mr. Miller, your innuendos|and locker-room fantasies -
{148165}{148313}- can't hide the fact your client|only worked when he wanted to.
{148317}{148420}Telling us what he thought we needed|to know about who he really was.
{148424}{148600}Andy insisted on bending the rules.|His work suffered as a result.
{148604}{148704}Explain it like I'm a six-year-old,|because I just don't get it.
{148708}{148809}Who makes these rules? You?
{148813}{148940}Read your Bible, Mr. Miller.|Old and New Testament.
{148944}{149001}Valuable rules.
{149005}{149120}- Excuse me ...|- Andrew?
{149127}{149206}I can't ...
{149332}{149410}Somebody get a doctor.
{149457}{149520}Turn him over.
{149524}{149597}Call an ambulance.
{149626}{149722}Let him breathe. Please, make room.
{149809}{149911}It's not working!
{149915}{150001}It's making him worse!
{150046}{150151}Did you notice any changes|in Andrew's appearance -
{150155}{150247}- in the year|leading up to his termination?
{150251}{150395}- Yes, I did.|-were they for the better or worse?
{150399}{150498}Sometimes for the better,|but generally for the worse.
{150502}{150652}Mr. Seidman, what did you think|caused these changes in appearance?
{150656}{150750}I was afraid ...
{150754}{150832}I suspected Andy had AIDS.
{150839}{150940}- Order!|- Thank you. Your witness.
{150944}{151129}Did you share your suspicions|with any of the other partners -
{151133}{151241}- before the decision|to fire Andrew Beckett was made?
{151245}{151406}No, I didn't mention it to anyone.|Not even Andy.
{151410}{151529}I didn't even give him a chance|to talk about it.
{151533}{151652}And I think I'm going to regret that|for as long as I live.
{151657}{151743}- Any more questions?|- That's all.
{151748}{151871}They are saying|that he wasn't a good lawyer.
{151875}{152031}Yet they gave him a lawsuit for|one of their most important clients.
{152035}{152144}They say that doesn't prove|anything. It was just a test.
{152148}{152221}They call it a "carrot".
{152225}{152319}They wanted to see|if he would rise to the occasion.
{152324}{152494}Say I had to send up a pilot up|in a plane that cost $350 million.
{152498}{152579}Who am I gonna put in that plane?
{152583}{152698}Some rookie, to see|if he can rise to the challenge?
{152702}{152805}Or am I gonna give that assignment|to my best pilot?
{152809}{152932}My most experienced ... my top gun.
{152936}{153010}I just don't get that.
{153014}{153174}Will somebody explain it to me ...|"like I'm a six-year-old".
{153206}{153279}- Juror number 6?|- I agree.
{153283}{153349}- Juror number 7?|- I agree.
{153476}{153556}- Juror number 10?|- I disagree.
{153560}{153621}- Juror number 1 1?|- I agree.
{153626}{153710}- Juror number 12?|- I agree.
{153717}{153840}- Have you awarded any damages?|- Yes, we have.
{153845}{153977}For back pay and loss of benefits,|we award $143,000.
{153981}{154092}For mental anguish and humiliation,|we award $100,000.
{154096}{154236}And for punitive damages,|we award $4,782,000.
{154336}{154401}You may record the verdict.
{154405}{154524}Everyone remain seated|until the jury is removed.
{154618}{154708}This trial is now concluded.
{154782}{154849}Congratulations.
{154853}{154987}-we'll get a reversal on this one.|-we'll get started in the morning.
{154991}{155075}Congratulations, Mr. Miller.|I'll see you at the appeal.
{155080}{155162}Congratulations, well done.
{155245}{155324}- Thanks a lot.|- I'll see you at the hospital.
