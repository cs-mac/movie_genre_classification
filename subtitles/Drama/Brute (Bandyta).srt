1
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,800
And I'll be right here
till the day I die

2
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,800
<i>Lister.</i>

3
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,800
<i>- Here.
- Collins.</i>

4
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,200
- Coy.
- Here.

5
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,800
Rain every day now for a week.

6
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,300
I used to like the rain when I was a kid...

7
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,800
even when it rained hard like now.

8
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,700
My last fight outdoors, it rained.
Slowed me up a lot.

9
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:45,100
One of the most beautiful ladies I ever knew,
I met in the rain.

10
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,900
High heels on wet pavement.

11
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,600
Here's your last look at Frank.

12
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,700
They don't waste much time, do they?

13
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:00,000
<i>Today they're gonna bury Frankie McLain</i>

14
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:04,700
<i>No more aches and no more pain</i>

15
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,900
<i>The good Lord
he treated Frankie very fine</i>

16
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:13,900
<i>He let him out
before he finished his time</i>

17
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,300
Well, gentlemen,
that's one way of getting sprung.

18
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,300
Maybe he's better off.

19
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,900
I didn't think that even Captain Munsey...

20
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,300
would put a 62-year-old man
to work in the drainpipe.

21
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,900
Yeah, another dead guy,
compliments of Captain Munsey.

22
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,500
Always on tap.
There he is now.

23
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,400
Joe. It's Joe with him.

24
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,100
Too bad about McLain.

25
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,900
You and he were good friends,
weren't you, Collins?

26
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,800
Frankie only had about eight months left to do,
didn't he, Captain?

27
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:28,800
Knowing McLain,
out in eight months, back in nine.

28
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,300
Right, Collins?

29
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,300
Still carrying a grudge, eh?

30
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,600
Lay off, Munsey.

31
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,200
No, not Munsey. Sir.

32
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,000
You won't even meet me halfway,
will you, Collins?

33
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,200
Ten days in solitary
haven't taught you a thing.

34
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,800
I bet it taught him
not to carry a shiv anymore.

35
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,100
Or do you still claim that knife
was planted on ya?

36
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,100
Never mind that.
The episode's closed.

37
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,700
Collins.

38
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,000
Why keep on fighting?

39
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,600
After all, I've got a job to do.

40
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,100
Very well. Have it your way.

41
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,400
Joe, I meant to come down
and visit you, but l...

42
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,300
Dr. Walters.

43
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,100
There's a meeting this morning.

44
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,400
You'd better get straightened out.

45
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,300
And the same to you.

46
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,900
Me ol' friend Joe
was in the hole

47
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:02,500
And it was worse than
where they're diggin' coal

48
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,400
He comes out holding
very high his head

49
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:11,400
And the man to blame
soon be very dea

51
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,400
- Good to see ya, Joe.
- I'm glad you're back.

52
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,800
Heard from the wife?

53
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,400
Joe, you know Kid Coy.

54
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,400
Seen him around.

55
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,000
They moved him
into Frankie McLain's place.

56
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:42,400
Frankie was tops,
a hard guy to follow.

57
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,300
Whatever you say, Joe.

58
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,400
About the stool pigeon, Joe...
We made arrangements.

59
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,600
Everything's okay?

60
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,100
What's okay?

61
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,200
Nothing's okay.

62
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,800
It never was, and it never will be.

63
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,900
Not till we're out.

64
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,900
You get that?

65
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Out.

66
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,700
Joe. After solitary,
even this will taste good.

67
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:34,200
- Thanks.
- Had a long talk with my mouthpiece yesterday.

68
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,400
Your lawyer came all the way from New York
just to give you advice?

69
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,300
Nah, ain't you heard?
He's right here in stir too.

70
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,000
Roberts, I need a little help.

71
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,300
- Get away from me.
- But you're in with Gallagher.

72
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,300
Roberts, you know Gallagher
can fx anything.

73
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,300
There are some things
that just can't be fxed.

74
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,200
Roberts, if you could put in a word for me...

75
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,100
- Gallagher, I gotta talk to you.
- What's he want, Louie?

76
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,700
- Blow.
- You gotta listen to me.

77
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,400
- I said blow.
- They'll kill me.

78
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,500
- Who is he?
- Wilson. He's here on a 529.

79
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,100
Also a stool pigeon.
He planted the shiv on Collins.

80
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,500
Munsey made me do it. Honest.

81
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,500
You can fx anything, Gallagher.

82
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,100
If you can call off Collins, I'd pay. I'd...

83
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,100
You'll pay.

84
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,300
Hello, Roberts.
How's that cold coming along?

85
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,400
Fine...

86
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,500
Strella, they tell me you're pressuring
some of the inmates in your area.

87
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,700
Am I?

88
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,700
Captain Munsey, sir,
I've gotta talk to you.

89
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,500
Please, sir. Please.

90
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:39,700
I understand you're responsible for
settling that little feud over in cell block "J."

91
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,800
We appreciate your assistance
of course, but...

92
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,300
The boys and I were only trying to help.

93
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,900
You and your boys.

94
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,400
There's a very old bylaw in this institution
about gangs or cliques.

95
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,000
We don't like them.
We don't want them.

96
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,100
Why don't you break them up, Captain?

97
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,900
Gallagher, when are you gonna remember
that you're not back home...

98
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,200
running a gang of hoodlums?

99
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,200
Let me be the policeman, eh?

100
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,400
You just serve your time.

101
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,500
And that way, we'll both get paid off.

102
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,500
That's right, Captain.

103
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,400
Like the Book says, we always get
what's coming to us.

104
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,500
All of us.

105
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,900
- Oh, excuse me, sir.
- What's the matter with you?

106
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,900
Wasn't his fault.

107
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,400
Sorry, Lister.

108
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,100
Ah, the warden's breakfast
ready and made

109
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,800
With the ham and eggs and the marmalade.

110
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,900
Sounds like a very important meeting
you're going to this morning, Doc.

111
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,800
Is Captain Munsey
gonna be there?

112
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,100
Brandy's the very best
drink in the world

113
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,600
If you drink enough
your toes get curled

114
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,700
Calypso, statistics show...

115
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:43,100
that if the level of alcohol in the blood
exceeds one half of one percent...

116
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,900
the blood pressure is affected,
a cerebral condition occurs...

117
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:50,300
and then... you're cockeyed.

118
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,900
And maybe that's the way it should be.

119
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,900
You don't like this place, Doc.

120
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,900
What for you stay here?

121
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:16,000
You haven't got much choice, Calypso.

122
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,000
Neither have I.

123
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:27,400
But it's not as easy as all that,
Mr. McCallum. This prison...

124
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,800
This prison has almost twice as many men
as it was built to accommodate.

125
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,100
There's not enough work
to keep the inmates occupied.

126
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,100
Why not?

127
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,000
The world we live in.

128
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,100
Yes, we can give them real work,
teach them trades, produce things.

129
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,400
But the civilian manufacturer
says we're competing with him.

130
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,600
Trade unions say we're putting
their people out of work.

131
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,100
Nobody wants to help.
Not us.

132
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,400
Manufacturers, unions.
You might as well blame the weather.

133
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,100
What you're really saying is
you can't handle the situation.

134
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,900
Excuse me, sir.

135
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,900
I don't think you quite understood
what the warden meant.

136
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,600
It's not only a matter of controlling the men.
He wants to help them.

137
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:12,800
Munsey, what this prison needs
is absolute discipline...

138
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,900
not charity.

139
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,900
Your loyalty to the warden
doesn't change the fact...

140
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,100
that he may be getting
too old for his job.

141
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:23,300
Age, Mr. McCallum,
is a matter of arteries, not years.

142
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:26,800
It's a pity, Walters, you're a better philosopher
than you are a doctor.

143
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,100
But I'm getting tired of you in both roles.

144
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:33,400
I was sent here today for one reason...
to tell you that if there's any more trouble...

145
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,400
if this prison isn't brought under
the strictest control...

146
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:39,600
- Mr. McCallum...
- There will be an immediate change
in practically all personnel.

147
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:43,400
We don't want to be bothered anymore.

148
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,400
Is that clear, Warden?

149
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,700
- Clear to you, Doctor?
- Oh, absolutely.

150
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,900
You can't be bothered.

151
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,200
Well, that simplifes everything.

152
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:04,200
The great public and its servants.

153
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,900
You put up prisons, thick walls...

154
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:10,700
and then your job is over, finished.

155
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,700
But is it over?

156
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,400
You and your patent medicine remedies.

157
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,500
Change the warden.

158
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,900
New personnel.
Absolute discipline.

159
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,100
Do you know what this prison is,
Mr. McCallum?

160
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,200
One big human bomb.

161
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:30,100
And you say, kick it and it'll be quiet.
Smash it and it won't explode.

162
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,500
Munsey, what do you think
of the doctor's viewpoint?

163
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I think, sir, that on occasion,
the doctor becomes unduly alarmed.

164
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,200
Warden?

165
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,200
I do. Like so many dreamers
and drunkards...

166
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,600
the doctor's emotional words are empty.

167
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,600
What's your solution?

168
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,700
All I know is that when people are sick...

169
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,700
you don't cure them
by making them sicker.

170
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,100
By your methods,
we send the man back to society...

171
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,700
a worse criminal than he was
when they sent him to us.

172
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,200
Platitudes, Doctor.
I'm waiting for your solution.

173
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:08,400
For men like you, Mr. McCallum,
there will never be any solution.

174
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,900
- Wait a minute, Walters!
- Not while you wanna destroy instead of build.

175
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,500
What we need here is a little more patience
and much more understanding.

176
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,000
We've been patient too long.

177
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,400
And as for understanding...

178
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:24,000
I'm positive the purpose of my visit
cannot be misunderstood.

179
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:27,700
You'll remain here, Warden,
only as long as there's no further trouble.

180
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,100
Doctor.

181
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,000
I'll see you to the gate, sir.

182
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,300
I've been warden here
for such a long time.

183
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,700
I wouldn't know where to go...

184
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,200
what to do.

185
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,800
- The place looks so nice now.
- Oh, that's swell.

186
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:10,500
- I got fiower drapes and big chairs...
- The boy doesn't know anything about it.

187
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,600
- Fine, fine.
- And if he did...

188
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,000
- She loves to come to see you.
- It's good she's so young.

189
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,200
She thinks it's such fun, like a holiday.

190
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,200
Over there. Your attorney.

191
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,400
- Ruth?
- She won't go through with it.

192
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,600
- But she's got to.
- I've had three different doctors to see her.

193
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:40,200
They've all tried to explain how
important an operation is, right away.

194
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:43,400
But she keeps saying no,
not unless you're there.

195
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,400
Nothing matters to Ruth without you, Joe.

196
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,900
Not even her life.

197
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
How long has she got?

198
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,000
I don't know.

199
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,100
Let me tell her you're here.

200
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,200
- No.
- She loves you, Joe.

201
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:59,100
- She'll understand.
- No.

202
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,700
Okay. I guess you know
what you're doing.

203
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:05,800
Go back and talk to her. Try to make her
go through with it. Keep tryin'.

204
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,300
- All right, Joe.
- Wait.

205
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,900
- Get some cash. Keep it in your offce.
- What are you going to do?

206
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,100
There's not much I can do, is there?

207
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,600
I'm not trying to interfere.

208
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,700
I'm just saying that if you send Roberts
back to the drainpipe, I won't...

209
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,400
All right, Munsey, have it your way.

210
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,100
They letting you run around loose?

211
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,600
I'm waitin' to be reclassifed.

212
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,000
Munsey'll find another job for me.
He always has.

213
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,700
Well, sit down.
Be with you in a second.

214
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,300
Glad you dropped in.

215
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,400
A patient of mine, old Pat Regan,
wants to see you.

216
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,300
There's a pass to the infrmary
right there on the table.

217
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,600
How quick will cancer kill somebody?

218
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,400
Well, that's the wrong way
to put the question.

219
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,400
These days, cancer doesn't
have to mean death at all. Why?

220
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,800
Well, how about
if they have to operate?

221
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,800
Even so, it depends entirely on the case.

222
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,100
The important thing, of course,
is the time element.

223
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,100
Somebody close?

224
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,100
By the way, what time is it?

225
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,100
- About 10:30.
- Are you sure?

226
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:42,000
To be exact, it's 10:27.

227
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,000
Why?

228
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,200
Wilson, 10:30.

229
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,900
Did I ever tell you about
that last limousine of mine?

230
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,900
Beautiful... and roomy.

231
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:46,500
Listen, that car was so long, when I picked up
the phone to talk to the chauffeur...

232
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,800
I had to call long-distance.

233
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,800
Strangely enough,
had this same number on it.

234
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,100
Keep movin'.

235
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,600
Wilson, 10:30.

236
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:23,800
- Where are you goin'?
- Just to get a drink, Wilson.

237
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,900
He made me do it!

238
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:57,800
No, don't! Stay away from me!
Captain Munsey made me do it!

239
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,900
You guys would have
done the same thing!

240
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,800
Dr. Walters.

241
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:21,400
Yes, Warden.
What?

242
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,500
Yes, yes. I'll be right over.

243
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,900
Warden, when did it happen?

244
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,700
- A prisoner just killed.
- Yeah?

245
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:37,100
Well, this is one rap they can't
hang on you, Collins.

246
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,700
I'm your witness.

247
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,100
Important thing, witnesses.

248
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,100
Lucky you asked me before
exactly what time it was.

249
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:49,900
Yeah, wasn't it?

250
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:51,900
A fella named Wilson.

251
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,300
Tough break.
Accident?

252
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,400
Positively.
Witnesses.

253
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,700
A human interest story.

254
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:25,200
Remember that terrifc third baseman,
got paroled a couple of years ago?

255
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,400
- Dougherty?
- He'll be back for the book.

256
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,500
just knocked off his old lady.

257
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,200
You don't say.
just shows you a guy don't think.

258
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:36,800
If he'd done it last year, we might have beat
the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association.

259
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:51,400
If you'd asked my advice about Wilson,
I'd have said, "Don't do it."

260
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,300
Maybe that's why nobody asked you.

261
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,300
It'll only make things tougher
for everybody else.

262
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,300
- I don't care about everybody else.
- That's cemetery talk.

263
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,300
Why not? We're buried, ain't we?

264
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,400
Only thing is, we ain't dead.

265
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,700
What's on your mind?

266
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,300
You and me... out.

267
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:15,200
They told me you had the fever ever since
the day you got here.

268
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:18,700
- I thought you had more sense.
- No lectures. Just yes or no.

269
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,200
Look, Collins, cons respect me.
So does the warden.

270
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:25,600
I've had a good setup here
because I've tried to help both sides.

271
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,500
- And I never crossed either.
- So what?

272
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,900
So, in spite of Munsey,
I'm still number one.

273
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,900
I've been here six years.

274
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,800
Know how many propositions I've had
to crack the wall?

275
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,600
Six thousand.

276
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,300
They're on tap all the time.

277
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,800
- Look, Gallagher...
- Wait a minute.

278
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,500
See this fella at the Linotype machine?

279
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,500
He's a lifer. Done 12.

280
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,400
- You know Collins. He's okay.
- Sure.

281
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,500
How's the plan?

282
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,000
If there's no hitch, we go Tuesday.

283
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,400
- You in, boss?
- No. Good luck.

284
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,500
It's all set this time.

285
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:17,200
It's been all set every Tuesday for 12 years.

286
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:22,800
And 12 years from now,
it'll still be next Tuesday.

287
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:27,600
Look, Gallagher,
I know this drum's full of crackpots.

288
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,700
One con's gonna buy his way out.
Another knows the governor's cousin.

289
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:33,900
A third guy's even gonna fioat out
in a homemade balloon.

290
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,500
But I'm not buyin' any pipe dreams.

291
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:40,800
It can be done. It's been done before,
and it'll be done again.

292
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,900
It can be done here... by us.

293
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,900
By you and me.

294
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:48,000
Collins, if I ever put in with anybody,
it'll be with you.

295
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,700
There's no need for that now.

296
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,500
You I can tell why.

297
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,700
Promised me my parole.

298
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,100
Very soon now,
I'll be walking out of here.

299
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,400
- Next Tuesday?
- Could be next...

300
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,500
So long, Gallagher.

301
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,800
White tie and tails
for the movie tonight

302
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,800
The boy gets the girl
and that's all right

303
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,900
It is too.

304
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,300
Check... mate.

305
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,600
Clip you again, soldier?

306
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:49,000
Yeah, chess, dominoes,
whatever we play.

307
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,300
- Don't you ever lose?
- Very seldom, friend.

308
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:55,000
I was born with what
you might call the golden touch.

309
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,300
I almost won the Golden Gloves once.

310
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,700
They gave me a watch
and a robe with my name on the back.

311
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,600
My girl was there... Henrietta.

312
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,900
I'll be in the infrmary.
I gotta see a guy.

313
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,600
- Still figurin'?
- Still.

314
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,300
Save me a seat at the movie.
Take it easy, lady.

315
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,700
Hey, what goes between you guys
and this dame?

316
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:23,500
Watch your language, my unromantic friend.
You're speaking of a lady.

317
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,200
It's enough to give somebody the creeps.

318
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:30,900
You fellas smilin' at a picture, throwin' kisses
at her. You might think she was real.

319
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,400
She is.
After a while, you'll get to know it too.

320
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:39,100
It's true.
To me, she looks exactly like...

321
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,000
- Like my wife.
- Yeah.

322
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:46,000
That's no ordinary pinup girl.
To each one of us, she's somebody special.

323
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,400
You mean if I keep lookin' at her
long enough like you fellas...

324
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,400
she'll begin to remind me of Henrietta?

325
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,400
But Henrietta's a blonde.

326
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,500
She don't look nothin' like her.

327
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,400
She doesn't have to.

328
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,600
Our calendar girl is just an inspiration,
Brother Coy.

329
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,900
She starts you thinking
about the one you really wanna see.

330
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
For example,
the last couple of days now...

331
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,400
she's had me thinking about Flossie.

332
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,300
I never told you gentlemen
about Flossie, did I?

333
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:22,900
To me, she's all the women I ever knew...

334
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,600
and a few I hope I haven't met yet.

335
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:31,300
I ran into Flossie one night
in Eddie's Place in Miami.

336
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:35,300
I had just sold a trusting gentleman
a few shares in a radium mine...

337
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,800
and I was trying to parlay my luck.

338
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,800
I had only met Flossie that afternoon...

339
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,700
but we were already very good friends.

340
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,100
The dice were hot,
and she kept them that way.

341
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,400
I was heading for a fortune.

342
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,800
Suddenly, just when everything
was sunshine and roses...

343
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:53,300
I heard the old familiar noises.

344
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,400
Leave it to the police
to break up a wonderful evening.

345
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:00,300
It looked as though everybody
was caught with their chips down.

346
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,800
The raid didn't worry me, but the gun
I was carrying was a problem.

347
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,500
So Flossie had me slip the gun
into her purse.

348
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:10,700
She was not only beautiful,
she knew the score as well.

349
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:14,100
Furthermore, she knew precisely
how to guide me through a back exit.

350
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,300
Obviously, the girl was no tourist.

351
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,600
My car was waiting there
just as pretty as you please.

352
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:23,900
And with my money and my gun still safe,
off we drove.

353
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:27,200
Driving along with such
a dream doll beside me...

354
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,900
I figured myself a pretty lucky guy.

355
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,500
Flossie had looks, brains
and all the accessories.

356
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,100
She was better than a deck with six aces.

357
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:40,100
But I regret to report that she also
knew how to handle a gun...

358
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,200
my gun.

359
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:46,200
Before, I had only suspected
that she was talented.

360
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,800
Now I was positive.

361
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,700
I didn't do much talking because,
for once in my life...

362
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,100
I couldn't find the right words.

363
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,000
She wanted all the money I had won,
and I never refuse a lady...

364
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,000
especially when she's armed.

365
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:02,200
Accordingly, I stepped out
of the automobile...

366
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,800
without any arguments whatsoever.

367
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,900
And that, gentlemen...

368
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
was the last I ever saw
of my car, my cash...

369
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,000
or my Flossie.

370
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,300
I wonder who Flossie's fieecing now.

371
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,100
I don't get it.

372
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:28,100
Why would a guy want to hang on
to a memory like that?

373
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,700
Who knows?
I guess when you're on the inside...

374
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:35,500
even the phony things on the outside
seem wonderful.

375
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,300
just so they happened on the outside.

376
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,100
All right. Go ahead.

377
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,500
Joe, how's the boy?

378
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,900
Where have you been?

379
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,200
All day long I've been askin' for you.

380
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:37,100
Frankie McLain...
he died in the next bed.

381
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:41,100
He gave me a message for you.

382
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,600
Drainpipe got Frankie.

383
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,600
Same as me.

384
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,600
But in that same drainpipe...

385
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,700
there's a way out of this place.

386
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,600
Go ahead.

387
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,600
He said...

388
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:07,500
"Ask Soldier how, in the war,
they took Hill...

389
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,500
Hill ..."

390
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,600
633?

391
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,200
Joe...

392
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:39,600
you... just gotta get in that drainpipe.

394
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:51,100
Oh, wait till Mr. Henty sees these.

395
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,400
I'll bet you he'll give us the biggest
egg contract in the county.

396
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,900
Do we have to name them all?

397
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,500
Well, they're not pets, you know.
They're our stock-in-trade.

398
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,700
If they don't get jammed
under the brooder and smother...

399
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,900
or drown in the drinking fountain
or get coccidiosis...

400
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,400
or peck each other to death, we...
we may be in the chicken business yet.

401
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:12,000
After you've fed
and watered them every three hours...

402
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,600
which you have to do until they can
take care of themselves...

403
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:18,000
you won't feel so sentimental
about 'em.

404
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,300
- Where's Tom?
- Stayed in the cell.

405
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,200
Another letter to his wife.

406
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:20,700
- Be with you in a minute.
- No, take your time.

407
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,700
Anything new?

408
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,800
Around here?

409
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,100
I ran into Harry Thomas
and his wife today.

410
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,300
Thought it'd be a good idea to get together,
maybe sometime soon.

411
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,600
You mean we might be
going out for a change?

412
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,300
Honey, make a wish.

413
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,600
What are you talking about?

414
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,800
Oh, Tom, darling.

415
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,000
Here, put it on.

416
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,100
It's beautiful.

417
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:07,000
It's the most beautiful thing
in the whole world.

418
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,900
It belongs on you.

419
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,300
It makes me feel so...

420
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,200
I don't know.
Like I was somebody.

421
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,600
Where'd you get it?

422
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,700
Where'd the money come from?

423
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,900
Cora, I stole the money.

424
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,300
I juggled the books and took $3,000.

425
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,300
You? You stole?

426
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,300
- Why?
- Darling, the way we were going...

427
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:52,200
you wanting things,
things you oughta have...

428
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,300
and me strapped all the time...

429
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,900
we were heading for a split-up.

430
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Don't you see?
I just had to do it.

431
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,100
All my life, the one thing I really wanted
was a fur coat.

432
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:13,600
- I can't give it up. I won't, Tom.
- No, darling.

433
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:16,700
- But what if something should happen?
- Nothing that happens could matter...

434
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,100
unless I lost you.

436
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:45,800
Sorry about that little incident
this morning.

437
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,700
Those things happen, you know.

438
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:51,600
- Yes, sir.
- Cigarette?

439
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:00,000
Tom, you're no hoodlum
like the others in this cell.

440
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,800
Why protect them?

441
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,900
We've been over that before, Captain.

442
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,300
Before, you didn't need my help
as much as you do now.

443
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,300
I'm in a position
to make things easier for you.

444
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,600
Like you did for Wilson?

445
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,500
Wilson was careless.

446
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,900
Careless people have accidents.

447
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:28,200
I get quite a kick out of censoring the mail.

448
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:31,700
All these letters you write home,
for example...

449
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,700
and the answers you never get.

450
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:37,900
Please, Captain,
let me alone.

451
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,200
She's the most important thing
in the world to you, isn't she?

452
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,900
Well, you'll come up for parole soon...

453
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,100
if your conduct's good.

454
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,200
I'm the one that decides that.

455
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:57,300
I'm the only one who can help you.
No one else.

456
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,900
Captain, I'm a cheap thief.

457
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,900
I know I'm a failure...

458
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,400
but I'm not an informer.

459
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,600
That's what I like to see in a man...

460
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:14,300
stability, fdelity.

461
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:18,000
You're right, Lister.
We're both wasting our time.

462
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:23,600
Me by talking to you
and you by writing to your wife.

463
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:27,800
- Captain, you've heard from her.
- By mail this morning.

464
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,400
Please. Please, Captain, tell me.

465
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,000
In a way, Tom, you're a free man.

466
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,100
She's divorcing you.

467
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:17,300
just a minute.
just a minute. Sit down.

468
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,200
The warden's going to talk to you.

469
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,200
All ready, Warden.

470
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,800
Men, I'm going to try to talk
some sense to you.

471
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:30,500
I'm gonna lay it right on the line.

472
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:33,100
There has been, in recent weeks,
a mounting unrest in this prison.

473
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,500
Don't think for one minute
that I don't know about it.

474
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:39,700
Up to now, you've enjoyed
the regulation privileges.

475
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:42,700
However, if you persist
in fighting among yourselves...

476
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:46,200
antagonizing the guards
and making way for accidents...

477
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:49,700
like the one that happened
in the machine shop this morning...

478
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:53,300
Then all your privileges will be revoked at once.

479
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,800
Be careful of your associates.

480
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,900
Always remember that one bad prisoner
can spoil things for the rest of you.

481
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,900
So watch your step.

482
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,200
It's up to you to protect
your own interests...

483
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,700
as I am compelled to protect mine.

484
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,100
If there's one more infraction of the rules...

485
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,000
if you cannot conduct yourselves
without creating a disturbance...

486
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:16,200
without further accidents...

487
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:20,700
then I shall have to use every means
to keep you under control.

488
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,300
So that's it, men. Meet me halfway
and you can depend on me...

489
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,300
to see that every prisoner is treated fairly.

490
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,700
Cell R17.

491
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:58,800
Convict McLain of cell R17 buried.

492
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,700
Collins comes back from solitary
to cell R17.

493
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:05,500
A prisoner is killed in the presence
of three convicts...

494
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,800
all from cell R17.

495
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,800
And now a suicide.

496
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,700
Same cell, same gang, same trouble.

497
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:15,200
just a minute. You're not tryin' to say
that we had anything to do with that.

498
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,200
- You said yourself, it was suicide.
- Only because I can't prove otherwise.

499
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:21,900
- Tom was one of us. The way we felt about him...
- I know. I know. You loved him.

500
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,600
You can't throw the hook into us.
We didn't touch Tom.

501
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:27,300
- You know we were at the movies.
- So you were.

502
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:30,500
And Collins was at the doctor's offce
this morning when Wilson was killed.

503
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:33,400
I'm a realist.
I don't believe in coincidence.

504
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,500
Especially when it happens
more than once.

505
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,000
You fought the warden,
the guards and me.

506
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,100
You're not ft for civil life,
and you won't accept prison life.

507
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,500
So tomorrow you'll begin a new life.

508
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,800
You'll all report for work in the drainpipe.

509
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:18,700
Hill 633, what is it?
What does it mean to you?

510
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,900
Well, it's a hill in Italy,
not far from Rome. Why?

511
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:27,800
- Tell me about it.
- There's not much to tell.

512
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:30,300
The krauts had the hill,
and we were ordered to take it.

513
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,000
How?
What'd you do, charge 'em?

514
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:36,400
Did you ever try it uphill with a few
kraut 88s puttin' the blast on ya?

515
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:39,000
Spencer, let me have those chessmen,
will ya?

516
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,500
Give me some light.

517
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,200
Here was the hill.
Here was us.

518
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:59,200
Mountains here,
the ocean here.

519
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,200
- Stalemate.
- But you took it.

520
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:05,500
Yeah. We took it, all right.
Give me some more light.

521
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:10,400
We sent some men out in a boat.

522
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,400
They landed up here.

523
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,900
We covered 'em
with a heavy bombardment.

524
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:17,200
At "H" hour, we attacked uphill.

525
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,800
The krauts turned all their guns to stop us.

526
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:25,000
That was exactly when the other gang
attacked from behind.

527
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:27,000
And it worked.

528
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,000
We got through, all right.
Most of us anyway.

529
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,100
The rest are still there.

530
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:55,300
They couldn't cover both sides, huh?

531
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,100
Thanks, Soldier.

532
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,600
How's that tie in with us, Joe?
What are you gettin' at?

533
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:04,300
We'll see tomorrow.

534
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,400
You know, I was just thinking.

535
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,500
An insurance company
could go flat broke in this prison.

536
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,300
I know how you feel, Gallagher,
and I'm sorry, but that's it.

537
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,100
But it doesn't add up, Warden.

538
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:51,600
You're punishing all of us
because Lister took his life. Why?

539
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,400
Things are out of hand. That's why.
It's the only decision we could make.

540
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,900
- We? You mean Munsey.
- No.

541
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,300
- I'm the warden here. This is my order.
- It's his work.

542
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,900
I've heard complaints about Munsey for years,
and I'm sick of'em.

543
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:03,600
Munsey knows his job, and he does his job.

544
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:08,200
Gallagher, I've tried my best to do
the right thing by the men, but it's just no use.

545
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:11,000
I'm convinced now that what's needed here
is not more charity, but more discipline.

546
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:14,700
Yes? No, no. Absolutely. No interviews!

547
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:17,100
I don't care what newspaper he's with.

548
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,700
Did you get McCallum yet?
Well, keep on trying.

549
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:22,200
Well, thanks for seeing me, Warden.

550
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:25,700
Just a minute.
There's one more thing, Gallagher.

551
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,500
I was going to send for you.

552
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,100
- This letter concerns you.
- Yeah?

553
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:38,900
Gallagher, you and I have always
been able to work together.

554
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:43,300
- You've been a great help to me with the men.
- What is it?

555
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:46,400
The Department of Corrections...

556
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:50,500
They've canceled
all parole hearings indefinitely.

557
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:58,100
What's this mean?
Another year?

558
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,200
Two? Five?

559
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:03,100
Not necessarily.

560
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:05,700
I'm sorry.
It's not my fault.

561
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:09,600
It is your fault!
You've given in to Munsey all along the line.

562
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:13,900
A couple of weeks ago I stood here, and you
told me the gates were going to open for me.

563
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,500
In just a few more days I was going home.

564
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:21,200
Home.
I should have known better.

565
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:23,300
Those gates only open three times...

566
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,600
when you come in,
when you've served your time...

567
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,600
or when you're dead!

568
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:29,900
Gallagher.

569
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,600
Can I still count on your cooperation?

570
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:44,900
Look at me, fellas. Hi.
I just got a pip of an assignment.

571
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:47,900
I gotta write a story provin' how good
the chow is around here.

572
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,000
You prove that and Time magazine
will make you man of the year.

573
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,800
Ah, there's somethin' interestin'.

574
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:57,800
Now what have you got here?

575
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:59,900
Message. Collins. Drainpipe.

576
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:02,000
- We're hot.
- Gotta be done.

577
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,500
Smell that.

578
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,100
Now you know
what happened to Rin Tin Tin.

579
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:12,900
- Western Union.
- Who?

580
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,600
- Collins.
- What's all the gab about?

581
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:19,100
Every day, I have to take chow
to them guys down in the drainpipe.

582
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:21,200
I don't like the job.

583
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:24,100
The air down there is very unsanitary.

584
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:26,200
Don't breathe in.

585
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:28,500
Just breathe out.

586
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:36,400
I've seen many a guy go to work
in the drainpipe.

587
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,400
There's more goes in as comes out.

588
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:41,400
They keep buildin' it long enough,
they'll run out of guys.

589
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,200
Besides, they're buildin' it backwards.

590
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:50,400
Nobody knows where that drainpipe
is goin' or where it'll come out...

591
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:52,900
or if it'll ever be used.

592
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,500
You know, the way I got it figured out...

593
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:01,400
Make sense.
What are you tryin' to say?

594
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:05,200
I got a favor to pose you.

595
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,200
Don't ask me no favors.

596
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:09,400
I can't be bribed, see?

597
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:14,100
Besides, you ain't got enough dough
to bribe me.

598
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:30,200
I was once married
to a dame like that bridge.

599
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:33,500
- What are you talking about?
- Wonderful structure...

600
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:36,000
but up in the air most of the time.

601
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:35,600
Becker, leave him alone.
Get back to work.

602
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:38,300
- He's sick. He needs help.
- Back!

603
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,300
I said get back.

604
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,600
- No. None for me.
- Better take it.

605
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,400
- Don't mind us, Father. We're just looking around.
- Shopping or buying?

606
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:04,200
New orders. We're supposed to
watch the men no matter where they are.

607
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:06,300
In here,
someone else watches after them.

608
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:09,000
- However, if you wish to stay.
- Thanks.

609
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:19,500
This'll be it then.

610
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:22,700
The main tower.

611
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,600
We need it to open the gates.

612
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:27,400
When the gates open,
the bridge comes down.

613
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:30,700
We all know there's no way out
except over that bridge.

614
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,500
So frst we've got to take the tower.

615
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:39,800
Now, you'll be here on the inside.

616
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:44,000
When we come out of the drainpipe,
we'll be here...

617
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:46,000
on the outside.

618
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:48,400
We hit the tower from both sides.

619
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,400
Lot of rifies and ammunition
in that tower...

620
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:55,400
but only one machine gun.

621
00:52:55,500 --> 00:53:00,500
Only one. Which means
they can't cover both sides.

622
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,800
- Once we take the tower...
- Yeah.

623
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:08,700
- How many men have you got?
- Five, countin' me. All set.

624
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,800
I have six.

625
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:16,600
My men won't know about you. I'm gonna
tell them only what they have to know.

626
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:18,800
Mine won't know any more.
When are you figuring?

627
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:20,600
- 12:15 tomorrow.
- You're crazy!

628
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:23,400
- That's just why we've got a chance.
- This takes timing, planning.

629
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,800
No. The longer you wait,
the longer the odds.

630
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:27,800
Somebody cools off,
another guy stalls...

631
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:30,100
a third guy can't keep his mouth shut.

632
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:34,100
No. For us it's now. We hit 'em hard,
fast, sudden, and we make it...

633
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:46,000
All right, Collins.
Tomorrow it is.

634
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:48,800
You will take care of everything?
The stuff to blow the tower?

635
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,000
- That's gonna be tough.
- We gotta have it.

636
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
All right. I'll try and get it to you.

637
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:58,800
Tomorrow then.
You hit the yard at 12:15.

638
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:01,200
I'll need two minutes.

639
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:04,500
At exactly 12:17 I'll be in the tower
opening the gates.

640
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:07,300
12:17.

641
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,400
The yard'll be full then.

642
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:11,900
When those gates open,
the whole population'll break out.

643
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:19,200
I know you got it all worked out, Joe,
but don't we need a getaway car?

644
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:22,500
How about money?
Can't get far without a little cash.

645
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:25,200
And clothes.
In these things we'd be spotted right away.

646
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:27,200
That's all I can tell you for now.

647
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:31,100
But we've been talking out
for a long time, and this is it.

648
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:36,300
Joe, I don't want you to get sore, but, well,
I've only got a short stretch left to do, and...

649
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,300
There's no such thing as a short stretch.

650
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,400
But you haven't told us much. We don't know
how it'll work or what's supposed to happen.

651
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,800
You're moving so fast that I...

652
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:47,100
Say it.
You want to pull out?

653
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:49,600
He can't.
We don't know any more than you do.

654
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:51,800
- You declared yourself in. You can't quit now.
- Shut up.

655
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:53,900
Don't misunderstand me, Joe.

656
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:58,700
- How many?
- Two.

657
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:01,400
- I'll play these.
- Three here.

658
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,300
In or out?

659
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:15,800
No guarantees go with this break.

660
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:21,500
It's all or nothing.
But you've gotta make up your mind now. Now.

661
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,700
Either way, no hard feelings.

662
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,400
With you, Joe.

663
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,400
I'll play along.

664
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:36,400
I never thought different.

665
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:41,100
- Neither did I.
- Joe.

666
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:57,300
I wonder what I'm gonna do.

667
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:00,200
Manage a couple of heavyweights maybe.

668
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:04,100
Who knows? I might even
wind up owning a piece of a champ.

669
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:09,000
All you guys'll sit ringside... free.

670
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,900
You're kidding yourself, Coy.

671
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,200
Odds are, once we're on the outside,
we'll never see each other again.

672
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:17,200
The big city for me.

673
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:21,300
When you got millions of neighbors,
nobody cares who lives next door.

674
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:23,900
I'll find a right dame.

675
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:30,000
That'll be that.

676
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:32,500
Say, won't Henrietta be surprised?

677
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:37,000
I think me and her'll go away
on a long trip.

678
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:40,600
Sure. Most cons get married
as soon as they get out.

679
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:43,000
Married? Gee, I never thought of that.

680
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:51,700
Hope you make it, Coy.
You going back in the stock racket, Spencer?

681
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:55,400
I think not.
Printing costs are so high these days.

682
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:59,000
I don't exactly know what I'll do.

683
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,700
Not yet.
What about you, Soldier?

684
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:06,500
I got a long way to go.

685
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Ever since the war, I've been trying to
get back to a little town in Italy.

686
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,200
But you know how the breaks go.

687
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:19,200
With me, one rap led to another.

688
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,700
Anyway, I was never able to make it.

689
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:26,700
Maybe this time.

690
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:52,900
Robert, you must go away.
The military police... they were here.

691
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:57,700
When were they here?
How long ago? What did they say?

692
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:59,800
I talked to them.
It was nothing.

693
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:03,100
- There are more important things.
- He has brought no food. He is leaving.

694
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:05,300
- So?
- Food's out there in the truck.

695
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,500
- Thank you.
- No. We will take nothing.

696
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:10,800
You will stand in line with the others.
When there is food, you will eat.

697
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:13,600
- And when there is no food?
- Then you will starve with the others.

698
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:16,900
We're not all
so fortunate as you, my daughter.

699
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,800
We have no great love
to quiet our appetites.

700
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:22,200
Robert does not object.
Why do you?

701
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:24,500
He does not know you so well as I.

702
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:30,500
Ah. Is it so great a crime to accept food
from those who deprived you of it?

703
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:32,800
Nothing personal, of course, but...

704
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:36,900
since you do not spare the bombs,
we do not expect you to spare the food.

705
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,500
- You Americans are such a generous...
- Never mind the speeches.

706
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:41,800
- The food's out there. Go get it.
- No!

707
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:46,400
He hates you, Robert. He hates your uniform.
He fought you in Sicily. He still fights you.

708
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:49,500
My position does not permit me
to hate anyone.

709
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:04,800
I'm foolish, so I cry.

710
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:07,700
It's nothing.
In a war, people cry easy.

711
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,400
Promise me you won't come here again.

712
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:18,200
Bringing us food this way
is against the law.

713
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:21,800
The law is second.

714
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:23,900
My wife comes frst.

715
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:42,500
Your military... they are back!

716
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:46,800
This food... say nothing about it.
You understand?

717
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:48,900
Robert is a stranger.
We never saw him before.

718
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:51,000
He stopped here for water.
Water for the truck.

719
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:53,500
And if they discovered I was lying,
what then?

720
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:56,600
- Why should I risk my neck for you?
- Because I stuck mine out for you.

721
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:58,700
For me? No, signor.
You came to see her.

722
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:03,000
I will not lie for you.
You and your police can destroy each other.

723
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:06,800
Sit down!

724
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:11,800
Gina, keep him here.

725
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,800
I'll get the water.
If they believe me, I've got a chance.

726
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:31,900
- You had nothing to do with this. Remember that.
- No. Robert...

727
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:36,100
Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.

728
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:40,600
Hey, Soldier. Snap out of it.

729
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:42,700
You're missin'a swell yarn.

730
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:48,700
- Go ahead, Spencer.
- Well, gentlemen, as I was saying...

731
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:51,700
there I was,
besieged on all sides...

732
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:55,000
the citizens to the front,
the howling investors behind me...

733
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:57,700
the sheriff's men closing in.

734
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:00,300
But I remained undaunted.

735
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:03,400
Smiling, secure in my rights.

736
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:06,600
- What happened?
- Here I am.

737
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:09,300
- Okay. Break it up. Let's try to get some sleep.
- Why?

738
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:13,000
- I like to hear Spencer talk.
- We've talked too much already.

739
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:16,700
There are ears all over this drum,
and they all belong to one guy.

740
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:24,000
What's the answer to it? Are we going to
have to keep every prisoner in ritual solitary?

741
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:26,700
Other prisons must have
these same problems...

742
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:28,500
but they clear them up,
keep things running smoothly.

743
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:30,700
We've been through
diffcult times before, Warden.

744
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:32,800
Oh, never like this.

745
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,600
And McCallum is coming tomorrow. Why?

746
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:38,300
Why can't he let me alone?

747
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,400
Everything's gone wrong.

748
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:44,700
I don't know who's to blame, but...

749
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:48,600
I do know that every prisoner hates us.

750
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:50,800
Not us. Me.

751
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:54,000
- It's me they hate.
- I wonder why.

752
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:02,500
You put on a guard's uniform
and see how much they love you.

753
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:09,000
You talk to the prisoners over a loudspeaker.
I talk to them with a club.

754
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:12,600
- You only make the rules. I have to enforce them.
- Maybe it's the way you enforce them.

755
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,800
Maybe it is.

756
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:19,400
I'm not criticizing, Munsey.
It's just that...

757
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:23,600
But you are.
And perhaps you're right.

758
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:27,600
All I know is that I've tried
to do my job as I saw it.

759
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:32,400
But if I'm the cause of this trouble...
if I'm wrong and those convicts are right...

760
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:34,700
then you can have
my resignation immediately.

761
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:39,100
No, Munsey. That's just what the inmates
would like. No, no. That's not the answer.

762
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:42,600
As you said, we've been through
some diffcult times together here. Well...

763
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:45,600
we're still here,
and we're still together.

764
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:48,500
Let's leave it that way?

765
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:53,500
Well, the situation
seems to call for a drink.

766
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:00,500
I'm going to turn in.
Good night.

767
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:06,000
Don't be discouraged, Warden.
It's a rule in all the best stories.

768
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:09,500
Everybody always lives happily ever after.

769
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:19,900
You don't believe I meant
what I said about resigning, do you, Doctor?

770
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,100
In a million words...

771
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,500
You're wrong.

772
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,700
I really want to help the warden.

773
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:31,600
It's just that he's confused.

774
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:36,100
He doesn't know that kindness
is actually weakness.

775
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:40,900
And weakness is an infection that
makes a man a follower instead of a leader.

776
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:45,900
Seems too me a very great leader
once said the meek shall inherit the earth.

777
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,900
Science contradicts that, Doctor.

778
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,600
Nature proves that the weak must die...

779
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:55,900
so that the strong may live.

780
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,900
Authority...

781
01:03:58,100 --> 01:03:59,900
cleverness...

782
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:02,100
imagination.

783
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:04,900
Those are the real differences between men.

784
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:11,100
I walk amongst these convicts...
these thieves and murderers...

785
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:13,900
alone, unarmed.

786
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:17,200
But they respect me.

787
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:21,900
They obey me.

788
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:24,600
Fits you, doesn't it?

789
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:29,600
The warden's chair.

790
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:32,200
- It fits you.
- You're drunk.

791
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:35,500
Why not? I'm a very ordinary man.

792
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:38,000
I get drunk on whiskey.

793
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:40,400
What makes you drunk?

794
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:43,500
- Power?
- You flatter me, Doctor.

795
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:46,900
I'm just a policeman.
I carry out the warden's orders.

796
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:51,200
Did he ever order you
to crucify the prisoners?

797
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:56,000
Were you ordered
to make convict Lister hang himself?

798
01:04:56,100 --> 01:05:00,200
- What are you talking about?
- You were seen going into Lister's cell...

799
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:02,100
and you were seen coming out.

800
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:06,100
What happened in between?
Did you censor his mail?

801
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:08,500
Wouldn't he give you
any information?

802
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:12,100
Or did you tell him a few lies
about his wife?

803
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:17,500
You better stop drinking, Doctor.

804
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:20,100
Your imagination's working overtime.

805
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,700
Visiting cells is part of my job,
helps me keep tabs on the men.

806
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:27,800
- In that way, I can control them.
- Control them?

807
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:30,700
You mean torture them, don't you?

808
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:34,200
The more pain you infict,
the more pleasure you get.

809
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:37,600
That's why you'd never resign
from this prison.

810
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:42,600
Where else would you find
so many helpless fies to stick pins into?

811
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:46,800
You talk to me like that?

812
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,900
If I didn't keep you here,
you'd be starving.

813
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,500
You surgical butcher.

814
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:54,600
For me, it's the last stop anyway.

815
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:59,100
But for you it's just a beginning, isn't it?

816
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:02,300
Why, you're Genghis Khan...

817
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,800
Alexander the Great...

818
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:06,600
Caesar.

819
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:09,300
Look at you in the warden's chair.

820
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:11,900
Caesar trying out his throne.

821
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:18,100
- That's enough.
- Caesar cries "Enough"?

822
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,600
You're obvious, Munsey.

823
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:27,600
Your every move is obvious.

824
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,700
You've cheated.

825
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:33,500
You've lied.
You've murdered.

826
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:36,600
You're worse than the worst inmates
of this prison.

827
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:40,100
You're the psychopath here,
not they!

828
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:54,800
That's it, Munsey.

829
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,300
Not cleverness.

830
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:03,700
Not imagination.

831
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:06,100
just force.

832
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:09,000
Brute force.

833
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,200
Congratulations.

834
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:14,300
Force does make leaders.

835
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,300
But you forget one thing.

836
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:20,200
It also destroys them.

837
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:54,400
Couple of hundred yards ahead
there's a side road. Turn right.

838
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:57,200
We got over a hundred miles to go.
We shouldn't be stoppin' now.

839
01:07:58,100 --> 01:07:59,500
- Shut up.
- Take it easy, Joe. Take it easy.

840
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:02,600
Why don't you see her after the job?

841
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:05,300
Because I said we're stopping now.

842
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:27,200
I'll only be a few minutes.

843
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:32,700
- Sadie.
- Good evening, Mr. Collins.

844
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:39,200
- Is she all right?
- She don't complain none, but she's about the same.

845
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:44,600
See that she doesn't need anything.

846
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:48,600
Yes, sir.
Mr. Collins, I'm glad you're here.

847
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:22,500
Ruth.

848
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:29,900
- I was dreaming about you.
- Something nice?

849
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,600
I dreamed I was running up a hill.
I was chasing you.

850
01:09:32,700 --> 01:09:34,300
- Catch me?
- Almost.

851
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:36,300
I must be slowin' down.

852
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:40,000
I guess I can make it come out
any way I want. It's my dream.

853
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:47,200
Pretty soon now you're gonna be
getting out of that chair.

854
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:49,500
And it won't be a dream either.

855
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:55,500
The frst thing we'll do
is go for a long walk.

856
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:57,600
- No cars for us. No trains.
- Just walking.

857
01:09:57,700 --> 01:10:01,300
- We'll walk around the world.
- I'm tired already.

858
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:04,400
I'll have Sadie fx you some supper.

859
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:06,400
And then we'll talk.

860
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:11,000
Oh, I've got a million things to tell you,
and this time I won't forget them. I made a list.

861
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:13,000
Ruth, I can't stay.

862
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:17,100
Next time, when I come back, I'll...

863
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:18,800
- Another next time?
- This is the last of them.

864
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:21,000
When I come back, it'll be for good.

865
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:32,300
Why? I'm sick, Joe.
Why do you love me?

866
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:35,200
When you're sick, people don't really love you.
They only feel sorry for you.

867
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:39,100
I'm not people.
I'm Joe Collins. One guy.

868
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,300
I'm sorry.
I guess I'm selfsh.

869
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:53,400
Every time you walk out that door
I'm afraid you're never coming back.

870
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:57,200
If I only knew where you came from,
where you go, what you do.

871
01:10:57,300 --> 01:11:01,100
Ruth, let's leave things
the way they started.

872
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:05,000
I'm a guy who ran out of gas who saw
an ordinary little farmhouse by the side of the road...

873
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:08,900
who found the frst important thing
in his life waiting for him in a wheelchair.

874
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:12,600
Let's keep it that way
for just a little while longer.

875
01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:14,800
Another day, maybe two, and...

876
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:17,800
I'll tell you anything you want to know.

877
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:19,900
I know what I want to know.

878
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,800
The rest doesn't matter.

879
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:25,900
If I weren't so sick, I could help you.

880
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:30,700
There are all kinds of sick people, Ruth.

881
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:32,700
Maybe we can help each other.

882
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:40,000
- I love you, Joe.
- Go on back and finish that dream.

883
01:11:40,100 --> 01:11:42,900
I'll slow down,
and you won't have to run so fast.

884
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:46,500
And when you catch me,
hold on tight.

885
01:12:42,700 --> 01:12:45,300
Only a couple of more hours.
Work close together.

886
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:52,300
Load's ready.

887
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:57,700
Take it easy, Roberts.
You got the whole day ahead of you.

888
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:00,800
- Sure. This is my racket.
- Thanks.

889
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:07,000
Soldier. To the right.

890
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:10,700
That switch.
When we break, you'll handle that switch.

891
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:13,100
Puts us on the other track...
the one that leads to the tower.

892
01:13:13,900 --> 01:13:15,700
- Got that?
- Check.

893
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:17,700
- What's all the chatter?
- Just wondering what time it was.

894
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:20,500
Why? You workin' by the hour?

895
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:37,700
- Morning, fellas.
- Hi, Louie.

896
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:43,400
- Morning, Chappie.
- Another story?

897
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:46,300
- Yeah, but this is a good one. Hiya, fellas.
- Hello, Louie.

898
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:50,000
Finally gonna make you grease monkeys famous.
Gonna put you all on the front page.

899
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:52,300
That's what got us here.

900
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:59,600
Tell me, Charlie. What has prison life
taught you about being a mechanic?

901
01:13:59,700 --> 01:14:03,000
It's taught me that when I get out
I shouldn't be a mechanic.

902
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:10,800
What about it, Andy?
Got anything to say to the press?

903
01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:13,800
There ain't much to say.
I do as I'm told.

904
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:16,800
Everything?

905
01:14:20,100 --> 01:14:21,400
Where do you keep your tools?

906
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:40,600
Eight frebombs flled with juice.
The best.

907
01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:43,700
Eight fuses.
Light two as you drive into the yard.

908
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:46,500
Like I say, I always do as I'm told.

909
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:49,200
We go to press at 12:15, sharp.

910
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:51,100
I'll be there.

911
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:57,400
Spell his name right, Louie.
His wife keeps a scrapbook.

912
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:10,900
- Is this all right, Gallagher?
- Yeah, fine.

913
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,700
- News. Some good, some bad.
- Good?

914
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:27,000
Eight frebombs in the toolbox,
truck ready to go.

915
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:28,400
- Bad?
- No dynamite.

916
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:30,900
- Gotta have it.
- Not a chance. Just came from the dye plant...

917
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,900
- Gotta have it!
- Not enough time.

918
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:40,600
Look, Louie.
I've got an important assignment for ya.

919
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:44,000
- Get down to the drainpipe. See Collins.
- Collins?

920
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:47,000
He's with us.
Tell him there's no dynamite.

921
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:50,000
- Do we go anyway?
- We'll have to go without it.

922
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:53,500
And, Louie, you got 45 minutes.

923
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:57,500
Think I'd be late for my
own coming-out party?

924
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:01,300
I've already...

925
01:16:01,900 --> 01:16:03,900
But I've tried to explain, madam.

926
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:07,800
No. No, I'm sorry. All visiting days
have been canceled, even for families.

927
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:10,500
- Take off your hat.
- I'm here to get a pass, Miss Lawrence.

928
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:12,600
- Where to this time?
- To the drainpipe.

929
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:14,500
We're doin' a special layout, and...

930
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:20,700
- Wait a minute. What's wrong?
- Nothing.

931
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:23,100
You want to do a story.
We want to help you.

932
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:34,000
Captain Munsey's offce.
Whose car?

933
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:37,300
Mr. McCallum's?
Okay. Pass it through.

934
01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:40,900
- What's the matter with him?
- Munsey left orders.

935
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:43,600
You wanted to
go to the drainpipe, huh?

936
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:46,100
- Yeah. Anything wrong with that?
- Munsey in?

937
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:48,900
- In and waiting.
- Come on.

938
01:16:58,300 --> 01:17:00,200
A customer for the drainpipe.

939
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:02,800
7033. Convict Miller.

940
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:08,000
Gallagher's man?

941
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:09,900
He was looking for a pass
in the warden's offce.

942
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:12,900
Gallagher?

943
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:17,700
- You want to see him now?
- Yeah. Yeah. Bring him in.

944
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,200
I understand you're interested
in the drainpipe.

945
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:42,700
I don't get this, Captain.

946
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:47,200
We're planning a big spread on the different
kinds of work the cons are doing, and I...

947
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:51,900
Oh, that's right.
You are a reporter, aren't you, Louie?

948
01:17:53,700 --> 01:17:55,700
Sit down.

949
01:17:57,100 --> 01:17:59,700
No, not there. Here.

950
01:18:00,700 --> 01:18:02,700
What's the point, Captain?

951
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:05,700
I've been to the drainpipe before.
I've been there a hundred times.

952
01:18:05,900 --> 01:18:09,500
- What's the idea of all this?
- Tell me, Louie.

953
01:18:09,700 --> 01:18:12,300
How does an illiterate like you
become a reporter?

954
01:18:13,300 --> 01:18:15,800
Even a star reporter?

955
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:18,600
- I don't know, sir.
- I do.

956
01:18:21,900 --> 01:18:23,800
What business did you have
in the drainpipe?

957
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:26,100
- I told ya.
- Tell me again.

958
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:28,300
To write a story.

959
01:18:31,700 --> 01:18:33,600
I don't like that answer.

960
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:09,300
Gallagher sent you to the drainpipe
to see somebody.

961
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:12,000
- Who was it?
- Nobody. Just to write...

962
01:19:15,100 --> 01:19:18,500
- Wrong answer.
- Leave me alone, Captain. Please.

963
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:21,300
I don't have the answers you want.

964
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:56,100
Now, we'll begin again.
Who was it Gallagher sent you to see?

965
01:19:56,300 --> 01:19:58,700
I told ya. Nobody.

966
01:19:58,900 --> 01:20:00,900
He gave you a message.
What was it?

967
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:04,900
There was no message.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

968
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:08,000
- You don't know much about anything, do ya?
- No.

969
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:10,100
I suppose you don't even know...

970
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:14,300
that Collins plans to break out
of the drainpipe at 12:15 today, do ya?

971
01:20:16,300 --> 01:20:18,400
Do you?

972
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:42,000
You have been lying to me, haven't you?

973
01:20:42,100 --> 01:20:45,000
Gallagher does know something
about the break, doesn't he?

974
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:52,100
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

975
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:55,600
You can hit me.

976
01:20:55,700 --> 01:20:57,600
You can keep on hitting me.

977
01:20:58,900 --> 01:21:01,800
But I don't know what you want.

978
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:30,400
Take him to the isolation ward.

979
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:34,900
Spread the word that he had an accident
coming back from the drainpipe.

980
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:39,700
Is there any connection
between Gallagher and Collins?

981
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:44,600
No.

982
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:47,400
If there was, he would have told me.

983
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,300
Okay. Get your man out of here.

984
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:54,100
Hey, you. Muggsy.

985
01:21:57,300 --> 01:21:59,200
Comin' up!

986
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:02,100
- Bring anything for me?
- No.

987
01:22:02,300 --> 01:22:04,300
- You sure?
- Sure, Joe.

988
01:22:06,700 --> 01:22:09,800
- Anything wrong?
- No.

989
01:22:10,700 --> 01:22:12,200
Back to work.

990
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:14,300
Collins.

991
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,300
The cardiogram just came back
from the lab, Collins.

992
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:29,300
- Yeah?
- Have to check you again.

993
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:33,700
Make it snappy, Doc.
Okay, okay. Keep it moving.

994
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:43,600
Louie was beaten up.

995
01:22:43,700 --> 01:22:45,900
Munsey.

996
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Louie might die.

997
01:22:48,100 --> 01:22:49,900
He sent a message.

998
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:53,400
Whatever your plan is,
don't go through with it.

999
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:55,600
Munsey knows.

1000
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:58,900
Believe me, Joe.
He knows you're going at 12:15.

1001
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:03,600
He's ready for you, Joe.
He wants you to go.

1002
01:23:03,700 --> 01:23:07,200
A prison break finishes Warden Barnes.

1003
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:09,200
Munsey'll be the hero.

1004
01:23:09,300 --> 01:23:11,900
He's using your life to make
himself warden.

1005
01:23:15,100 --> 01:23:16,900
Gallagher been picked up?

1006
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Gallagher? No.

1007
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:21,800
Why?

1008
01:23:21,900 --> 01:23:25,300
Joe, you haven't got a chance.

1009
01:23:27,300 --> 01:23:29,100
How did Munsey find out?

1010
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:32,100
The Munsey way. An informer.

1011
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:34,300
One of your own men, I suppose.

1012
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:39,200
Don't go through with it, Joe. Don't.

1013
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:42,800
Thanks for tryin', Doc.

1014
01:24:31,100 --> 01:24:35,400
We got about 10 minutes.
There's fve of us. We'll have to go one at a time.

1015
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:38,300
- What position do you want?
- You're the boss.

1016
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:40,300
Whatever you say.

1017
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:50,200
Take your pick for the break.
What position?

1018
01:24:50,300 --> 01:24:53,700
I said I'd play along with you, Joe.
You name it.

1019
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:58,100
- You.
- Same goes for me.

1020
01:25:01,900 --> 01:25:03,900
We've only got a few minutes, Freshman.

1021
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,400
When we break,
what position do you want?

1022
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:08,800
I want to give all the help I can, Joe.

1023
01:25:08,900 --> 01:25:11,500
- What position?
- Last.

1024
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:15,000
That'd be the toughest,
wouldn't it, Joe? Last.

1025
01:25:44,300 --> 01:25:46,200
Louie got hurt.

1026
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:50,100
Got banged up, they say,
comin' back from the drainpipe.

1027
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:51,900
- Coming back?
- Yeah.

1028
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:54,600
- Munsey.
- Keep circulating.

1029
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:35,500
Clay pigeons would have
a better chance.

1030
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:38,900
Sorry, Captain.
I didn't see you there.

1031
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,400
That's all right, Hopkins.

1032
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:46,400
But just remember. There's no reward
for bringing them back alive.

1033
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:49,000
- Not in this jungle.
- Yes, sir.

1034
01:26:57,800 --> 01:27:00,400
- Now, is there anything else you want done, sir?
- No.

1035
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:11,500
Bradley, join the guard
along that section of the wall.

1036
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:38,300
Ready to go?

1037
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:54,100
Look out!

1038
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:01,500
Drop the club. Drop it.

1039
01:28:08,300 --> 01:28:11,200
Coy, you and Spencer dump this dirt.
Dump it back there.

1040
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:17,900
Give me a break, Collins.
I didn't do anything.

1041
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,900
- I didn't have a gun. Give me a break.
- Shut up.

1042
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:23,100
- Now you men listen to me.
- Collins, count me out.

1043
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:26,900
- I don't want any part of this.
- Take me with you, Joe. I'll do anything you say.

1044
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:30,200
- Just take me with ya.
- Me and my boys are gettin' out of here.

1045
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:32,200
The action starts in the yard.
That's when we go.

1046
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:36,500
After that, you can suit yourselves. Right now
do as I say. Get back in the hole... all of you.

1047
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:40,000
Spencer, you and Coy
strip some of that electric wire.

1048
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
Soldier, get that hack over there.

1049
01:28:44,900 --> 01:28:48,000
Joe, what about me?

1050
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:55,800
It'll be no discredit to you.
You'll go away for a short while.

1051
01:28:55,900 --> 01:28:59,300
When you get back,
we'll try to ft you in someplace else.

1052
01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:01,300
I can't resign.

1053
01:29:06,900 --> 01:29:10,000
- This is my whole life.
- Sign it.

1054
01:29:24,100 --> 01:29:27,000
Get on that loudspeaker.
Tell them you've resigned.

1055
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:34,800
Attention.

1056
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:41,800
This is Warden Barnes.

1057
01:29:41,900 --> 01:29:44,300
I have just resigned.

1058
01:29:49,300 --> 01:29:52,300
Tell them the prison's now
in charge of Captain Munsey.

1059
01:29:53,700 --> 01:29:55,900
- Munsey?
- Go on. Tell them.

1060
01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:01,900
With Warden Barnes's resignation
now in effect...

1061
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:05,600
this institution
is in charge of Captain Munsey.

1062
01:30:05,900 --> 01:30:08,700
I repeat. Captain Munsey is your warden.

1063
01:30:09,300 --> 01:30:11,700
You will obey him.
You will take all orders from Warden Munsey.

1064
01:31:35,100 --> 01:31:37,700
- Quick!
- You got me wrong! Munsey made me do it, Joe!

1065
01:31:38,700 --> 01:31:39,700
Please! I'll tell you everything! Joe!

1066
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:42,600
Don't! Not this way! Joe!

1067
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:45,200
Joe, will you listen to me?

1068
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:48,700
You'll never make it!
It's a setup! They're waiting for us!

1069
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:38,200
You and Tom get down there.
Here. I'll take this.

1070
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:40,300
Get the gun and come on.

1071
01:33:49,900 --> 01:33:52,700
Come on, Collins. Come on.

1072
01:33:58,300 --> 01:34:00,300
What's the plan now?

1073
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:02,500
The plan's a flop. You're on your own.

1074
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:06,600
It's a million-to-one.

1075
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:23,400
He's trying to ram the gates!

1076
01:34:53,700 --> 01:34:55,300
It's Collins!

1077
01:36:34,300 --> 01:36:36,300
That hurt plenty.

1078
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:39,200
This place is full of pain, Calypso.

1079
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:43,900
You're hurt.

1080
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:51,100
Collins and Munsey are dead.

1081
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:54,800
And the others.

1082
01:36:54,900 --> 01:36:57,400
All those others.

1083
01:36:58,900 --> 01:37:02,400
Why do they do it?
They never get away with it.

1084
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:07,900
Alcatraz. Atlanta. Leavenworth.

1085
01:37:08,100 --> 01:37:12,200
It's been tried in a hundred ways
from as many places.

1086
01:37:12,300 --> 01:37:14,700
Always failed.

1087
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:17,300
But they keep trying.

1088
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:19,600
Why do they do it?

1089
01:37:19,700 --> 01:37:21,600
I don't know, Doc.

1090
01:37:21,700 --> 01:37:25,300
But whenever you got men in prison,
they're gonna want to get out.

1091
01:37:25,300 --> 01:37:27,300
But they learn.

1092
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:30,600
They must!

1093
01:37:32,700 --> 01:37:34,800
Nobody escapes.

1094
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:40,500
Nobody ever really escapes.
