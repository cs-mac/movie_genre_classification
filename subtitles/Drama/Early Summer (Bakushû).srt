- Come on
- I'll be right there

19
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,053
I told him

20
00:03:42,179 --> 00:03:44,472
Take this with you

21
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:53,148
- Some pickles
- Thanks

22
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,280
Where's Isamu?

23
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,948
Isamu!

24
00:04:02,074 --> 00:04:04,200
- Looks delicious
- Isamu!

25
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:06,328
Isamu!

26
00:04:16,797 --> 00:04:19,049
- Have you washed your face?
- Yes

27
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:22,385
No, you haven't. Your face is still dirty

28
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:31,311
Hurry up, Isamu

29
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:08,181
- Done already?
- I washed my face!

30
00:05:08,307 --> 00:05:11,267
If you don't believe me,
check the wet towel

31
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,852
All right

32
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,189
You sure?

33
00:05:16,982 --> 00:05:19,484
- Here
- Thank you

34
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,823
- We've started
- Will you post this for me?

35
00:05:29,328 --> 00:05:31,246
Chew your food well

36
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:42,382
- You're off early
- I've got a very sick patient

37
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:57,981
- I'll bring uncle back with me
- I appreciate it

38
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:02,736
- See you later
- Bye

39
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,195
Bye!

40
00:06:04,321 --> 00:06:07,115
Hurry, Brother!
You only have seven minutes

41
00:06:08,075 --> 00:06:10,034
Are you coming?
Where will we meet?

42
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,954
Noriko and I have decided
on a place

43
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:18,960
See you later

44
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:25,258
Thanks for breakfast!

45
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:29,471
Hurry up, Isamu

46
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:37,645
What kind of food does uncle like?

47
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:41,941
You don't have to cook anything
special, but he likes beans

48
00:06:42,067 --> 00:06:45,111
- Me, too!
- Just be quiet and eat

49
00:06:45,237 --> 00:06:47,572
You're slow, Isamu

50
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:49,324
Thanks for breakfast

51
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:28,988
- I'll be off
- Have a good day

52
00:07:29,114 --> 00:07:32,116
- See you at 5:30
- All right. See you later

53
00:07:34,286 --> 00:07:36,246
You'll be late for school

54
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:40,708
Don't forget father's post

55
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,502
Thanks. Bye for now

56
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,462
See you later

57
00:07:44,588 --> 00:07:47,215
What are you doing?

58
00:07:58,143 --> 00:08:01,020
- Bye!
- Have a good day

59
00:08:01,146 --> 00:08:03,231
- You've got everything?
- Yes!

60
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,109
Bye!

61
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:10,715
- Morning
- Morning. Where's your brother?

62
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:12,717
- He caught the earlier train
- I see

63
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:19,557
- So there's a very sick patient?
- Yes, I was there till 11:00 last night

64
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,436
- I'm enjoying Les Thibault
- Where are you up to?

65
00:09:23,562 --> 00:09:25,897
- Halfway through the fourth volume
- I see

66
00:10:17,324 --> 00:10:19,742
Now your toes are all neat and clean

67
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,912
Here's a treat for you

68
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:27,792
Here. You love your grandpa?

69
00:10:29,336 --> 00:10:30,795
Very much?

70
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:33,006
- Very much
- Really? Here

71
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,757
I love you

72
00:10:34,883 --> 00:10:38,469
- Here
- I love you

73
00:10:38,595 --> 00:10:40,513
That's enough

74
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:46,853
- I hate you
- Hey!

75
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,443
- I hate you very much!
- Stop it!

76
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,292
An order's come in
for our new product

77
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:56,714
- What about Asahi Processing?
- That's still pending

78
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,104
Know a good cafe?

79
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:15,608
Well, I'd recommend the Luna
in West Ginza

80
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:18,319
- It's a tiny place, though
- Luna?

81
00:12:18,445 --> 00:12:21,322
Did you give that stuff
to the director?

82
00:12:21,448 --> 00:12:23,241
Yes, why?

83
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:24,826
That's fine

84
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,209
Yes?

85
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:40,341
- Hello
- Ah, here comes the debt collector

86
00:12:41,885 --> 00:12:43,678
- Hello
- Hello

87
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:51,060
- Are you busy?
- Very busy

88
00:12:51,186 --> 00:12:53,563
It must mean the business
is going well

89
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,022
Thank you

90
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,400
What happened the other night?

91
00:12:57,526 --> 00:13:01,070
It was very entertaining.
Mr Yada started singing again

92
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,740
What a shame

93
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,243
It made mother's heart act up again

94
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:09,704
Don't worry,
the old bag's not about to die yet

95
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:19,297
Did you hear?
Chako's getting married

96
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:22,675
I didn't know. To whom?

97
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:26,512
- Mr Tsumura. Don't you know him?
- Mr Tsumura?

98
00:13:26,638 --> 00:13:29,056
He played basketball
for Waseda University

99
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:31,517
I don't know him. Is it a love match?

100
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:35,396
She's had a crush on him forever

101
00:13:35,522 --> 00:13:38,816
You're a sad sight,
like two jealous old maids!

102
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,159
Here, I hope it doesn't bounce

103
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:50,453
- Thank you
- You're welcome

104
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:52,413
- I'm going out
- Where to?

105
00:13:52,539 --> 00:13:55,666
Mr Robert's hotel.
If he calls, I'll be there at 2:00

106
00:13:55,792 --> 00:13:58,586
Could you give me a lift?

107
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:01,797
- It's out of your way
- I'll continue home from there

108
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,303
- Will you come by later?
- I can't today

109
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:10,473
- All right. Bye
- Bye

110
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:36,540
SHIKIKAWA'S

111
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:47,426
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Thank you

112
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:53,808
What's this?

113
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:55,893
- Some sort of seafood
- Squills

114
00:14:56,019 --> 00:14:57,728
- Some more?
- I've had enough

115
00:14:58,897 --> 00:15:01,857
- You certainly can drink, can't you?
- It tastes good

116
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:05,027
- Won't you have a bit more?
- Maybe just a drop

117
00:15:05,153 --> 00:15:09,198
I'm not wasting it.
You don't need to drink just to keep up

118
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:13,536
- What's funny?
- That's so typical of him

119
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:16,539
- He's always like that
- Like what?

120
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:23,587
You have a habit of offering
something and then taking it back

121
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:25,840
She said she'd had enough

122
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:29,135
- You have no sense of etiquette
- What do you mean?

123
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:33,222
- Is the tempura good, sis?
- Really good

124
00:15:34,766 --> 00:15:38,894
You're always bringing up etiquette
at every turn...

125
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:42,690
...expecting men to be kind to women
by law or something

126
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:46,027
But you're mistaken

127
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:51,615
Men and women should have respect
for each other

128
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:54,285
That's what etiquette really means

129
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:57,538
So you do know. That's good

130
00:15:57,664 --> 00:16:00,624
- I didn't think he did
- Idiot!

131
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:03,836
- Noriko, do you want some rice?
- Yes, please

132
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:14,388
It's been deplorable since the war

133
00:16:14,514 --> 00:16:19,310
Women have become so forward,
taking advantage of etiquette

134
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:23,147
That's not true.
We've just taken our natural place

135
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:26,442
- Men have been too forward till now
- Hear, hear!

136
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:31,489
That's why you can't get married

137
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:35,868
It's not "can't", it's "won't"!
I could any time, if I wanted to

138
00:16:35,994 --> 00:16:37,620
Lies!

139
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:41,457
- Just don't marry a doctor
- Never!

140
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,168
What? You two are impossible

141
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:49,715
We should hurry
if you still want to go to Ginza

142
00:16:49,841 --> 00:16:51,384
Really?

143
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,848
He's coming on the 9:45 train.
We have plenty of time

144
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,853
When was the last time uncle visited?

145
00:17:02,979 --> 00:17:06,565
A year after the war ended.
The station was so crowded

146
00:17:06,691 --> 00:17:09,777
That's right. I was still wearing
those wartime trousers

147
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:13,364
He's kept in good health
through it all

148
00:17:18,703 --> 00:17:20,287
This rice tastes good

149
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:44,311
I remember that scroll
from the house in Yamato

150
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:52,027
What happened to the other one
that was shaped like a fan?

151
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:56,323
- The one shaped like a fan...
- Oh, I sold it

152
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,908
Really?

153
00:18:00,328 --> 00:18:02,163
This one's really nice

154
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:07,501
Prices have gone up, times are hard

155
00:18:16,219 --> 00:18:18,262
You're working on Sunday?

156
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:22,349
Yes. Shall I bring back
some treats for uncle?

157
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:25,102
But he can't chew anything hard

158
00:18:25,228 --> 00:18:28,147
All right, then I'll be going

159
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,732
See you later

160
00:18:36,239 --> 00:18:39,617
Bye!

161
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:51,629
Noriko, take this up to uncle

162
00:18:52,672 --> 00:18:54,840
Is that all, sis?

163
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:02,306
Here's some tea for you, Uncle

164
00:19:09,147 --> 00:19:12,650
How old are you now, Noriko?

165
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,361
Twenty-eight

166
00:19:18,114 --> 00:19:21,075
- She's 28 now
- Is that right?

167
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:23,035
About time to get married

168
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:30,292
Some women don't want
to get married

169
00:19:30,418 --> 00:19:33,546
You're not one of them, are you?

170
00:19:44,182 --> 00:19:46,392
- Here's my share, 570 yen
- I have change

171
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:49,395
- Don't bother
- No, I insist. I've got some

172
00:19:51,022 --> 00:19:52,398
- Here
- Thanks

173
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:55,776
We could've cooked that same meal
for a third of the price

174
00:19:55,902 --> 00:19:59,822
- Not nearly as delicious, though
- But the whole family could’ve eaten

175
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:03,158
I almost forgot.
How much was the coffee in Ginza?

176
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:04,618
That's my treat

177
00:20:04,744 --> 00:20:06,870
- No, how much?
- It was my treat

178
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:09,999
Are you sure? Thank you

179
00:20:14,337 --> 00:20:16,088
- Auntie
- What?

180
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,591
What is it?

181
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:23,137
- What?
- Is Uncle deaf?

182
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:24,763
Not at all

183
00:20:24,889 --> 00:20:27,349
But he can't hear me

184
00:20:27,475 --> 00:20:29,018
Yes, he can

185
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:10,559
Idiot

186
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,944
Speak louder!

187
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:22,297
- Aren't you tired, Uncle?
- Maybe...

188
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:26,385
How old are you now?

189
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:28,178
Twenty-eight

190
00:22:29,764 --> 00:22:33,434
Well, it's about time
you got married, isn't it?

191
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,979
Do you know any good men
in Yamato?

192
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:39,565
Someone rich...

193
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:45,237
...who can make me happy
and give me a very easy life?

194
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:48,532
What a lovely day!

195
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:54,705
- Good afternoon
- Afternoon

196
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:59,418
Taking a walk with grandma, Mitsuko?
Where are you off to?

197
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,879
The weather's too nice to stay in

198
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:05,716
- Is your father home?
- No, he's with your brother

199
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:07,301
At the conference?

200
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:12,806
I hope he's a help and not a hindrance
to your brother

201
00:23:12,932 --> 00:23:15,809
Quite the opposite, I'm sure

202
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:18,854
Your dress is so pretty

203
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:24,359
- I hear you have a guest
- He's here with me

204
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:26,779
Is that so?

205
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:32,618
Isamu, give uncle some sweets

206
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,542
Here

207
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,634
Eh? He eats the paper too

208
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:22,477
He must be enjoying this

209
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:25,397
I hope he can hear the show

210
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:28,901
We got him a seat
right near the front

211
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,745
Takako's taking a long time
in her bath

212
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:43,582
- Why did she leave home?
- Well...

213
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:48,170
When I got home from downtown,
she was here crying

214
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:50,964
Then she asked me
to let her stay the night

215
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:55,844
- She had a fight with her husband
- But they're such a happy couple

216
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:58,013
Maybe too happy

217
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:03,894
Ah, Noriko's here

218
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,437
Thanks for the bath

219
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:08,148
- When did you get here?
- Not long ago

220
00:26:08,274 --> 00:26:11,109
Why are you staring at me?

221
00:26:11,235 --> 00:26:13,111
- You were too happy
- What?

222
00:26:13,237 --> 00:26:15,948
- In your marriage
- Not at all

223
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:18,659
- What were you fighting about?
- Nothing at all

224
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:20,953
- It wasn't "nothing at all"!
- What happened?

225
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,746
- You know our dog?
- What dog?

226
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:24,581
My pet dog Chibi

227
00:26:24,707 --> 00:26:27,042
It chewed his pipe

228
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:30,128
He left it lying around,
so of course the dog chewed it

229
00:26:30,254 --> 00:26:32,589
It's a nice pipe from London
or somewhere

230
00:26:32,715 --> 00:26:37,552
He blamed me, so I served him carrots
every day out of spite

231
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:41,181
- The dog hates carrots?
- Not the dog, my husband!

232
00:26:41,307 --> 00:26:43,976
- A horse would have loved them
- Idiot!

233
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:47,771
Anyhow, he blew his top this morning

234
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:51,316
- Over something so trivial?
- It was really upsetting

235
00:26:51,442 --> 00:26:54,111
You just have to be patient with him

236
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:56,822
- You're a married woman
- So what?

237
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:59,908
You have to put up with it.
Doesn't she?

238
00:27:00,034 --> 00:27:02,661
It's only natural, isn't it?

239
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:05,914
All husbands are selfish like that

240
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,667
That's why we won't get married

241
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:10,877
That's right, isn't it?

242
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:13,505
What? You know nothing
about married life

243
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:16,466
- Married life?
- Only married people understand

244
00:27:16,592 --> 00:27:19,636
Once you're hitched,
it's too late to understand

245
00:27:19,762 --> 00:27:21,388
I'm going home

246
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:24,891
Yes, you should

247
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:27,310
It's for the best

248
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:29,563
He'll still be eating carrots

249
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:31,648
Then I'm staying

250
00:27:31,774 --> 00:27:33,316
- Not going home?
- No

251
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:35,485
- Then spend the night here
- No

252
00:27:35,611 --> 00:27:36,903
- So you'll go?
- No

253
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,281
Make up your mind!

254
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:41,450
Takako, your husband's on the phone

255
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:43,618
Oh, really? Thank you

256
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:52,044
- Aya, shall I bring it up?
- What?

257
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:55,839
You know.
Should I ask Noriko about it?

258
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:57,883
- About what?
- This

259
00:27:58,009 --> 00:27:59,468
Your heart?

260
00:28:00,511 --> 00:28:03,847
She wants your brother
to examine her

261
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:06,725
- Do you think he'd see her?
- You?

262
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:12,022
Yes. I feel sick whenever
I drink a few tiny cups of sake

263
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:16,276
- Then stop drinking!
- In my business I have to drink

264
00:28:16,402 --> 00:28:18,945
My heart starts racing

265
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,156
Someone recommended
moxa treatment...

266
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:23,325
...so I went to this place
in Yokohama

267
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:27,037
- I've heard this already
- I'm talking to Noriko not you

268
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:31,374
- I'll explain it to Noriko later. Right?
- Of course

269
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:35,295
I hope you will. Thank you

270
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:39,841
Oh, by the way,
your boss is upstairs

271
00:28:39,967 --> 00:28:41,885
- Alone?
- He just got here

272
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:45,347
- I should go and say hello
- What?

273
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:47,307
I still have time

274
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:55,232
- Are you staying, Noriko?
- Are you going home?

275
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:57,692
Yes, I'm going.
Thanks for everything

276
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:00,362
Why? Sit down and relax

277
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:03,949
I can't.
He's waiting for me in Ginza

278
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,951
Who? Mr Carrot?

279
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:08,203
Yes. Sorry

280
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:10,622
Go on, then

281
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:18,213
You're going to Chako's wedding,
aren't you?

282
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:20,465
No, I'm not going

283
00:29:39,443 --> 00:29:41,278
Excuse me

284
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:44,156
Oh, you're here?
Come and sit down

285
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:53,081
Hill Enterprises called
after you left

286
00:29:53,207 --> 00:29:55,876
- And?
- I did as you said

287
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:57,878
Thank you

288
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:01,840
Have a drink

289
00:30:10,641 --> 00:30:12,267
Thank you

290
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:21,318
Oh, I'm glad you came.
I wanted to talk to you

291
00:30:22,361 --> 00:30:25,113
- Are you...?
- Yes?

292
00:30:25,239 --> 00:30:27,365
Why don't you get married?

293
00:30:28,492 --> 00:30:30,076
It's about time

294
00:30:31,662 --> 00:30:33,663
I have a good prospect

295
00:30:33,789 --> 00:30:36,875
A man from my old university,
a little older than me

296
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,960
He lived in Calcutta for a long time

297
00:30:39,086 --> 00:30:41,504
His name's Manabe. A good man

298
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:45,091
He's never been married.
I'm not sure if he's still a virgin

299
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:47,761
I have some photos of him

300
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:55,310
They're not that clear.
This is him

301
00:30:57,396 --> 00:30:58,730
Have a look

302
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:00,899
This one, too

303
00:31:03,277 --> 00:31:06,821
He's a better golfer than me,
and better looking

304
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:10,992
- Sorry but...
- What?

305
00:31:11,118 --> 00:31:13,370
I have to go and meet someone

306
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:18,583
- Are you trying to escape?
- No, but my parents are at Kabuki

307
00:31:18,709 --> 00:31:21,711
Really? Then take my car

308
00:31:22,546 --> 00:31:25,507
- If you don't mind, it's to Shinbashi
- Fine

309
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:28,134
Thank you

310
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:33,265
Take these with you

311
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:35,600
Ask your folks their opinion

312
00:31:35,726 --> 00:31:37,143
Come on, take them

313
00:31:37,895 --> 00:31:40,480
All right, thank you

314
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:23,273
- Sorry to keep you waiting
- Thanks

315
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:28,820
Aren't you sleepy, Uncle?

316
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:32,949
Brother, you must be tired

317
00:32:33,075 --> 00:32:34,701
No

318
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:38,413
Why don't you go to bed?
You have an early train tomorrow

319
00:32:38,956 --> 00:32:42,917
I really enjoyed the play today

320
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:48,214
The young actors were so good

321
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:53,094
Really admirable

322
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,638
Really? I'll have to see it

323
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:59,184
I'm glad you liked it

324
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:06,191
- I'm off to bed
- All right

325
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:09,277
Come and see me in Yamato

326
00:33:09,403 --> 00:33:12,739
I will,
after Noriko's been sorted out

327
00:33:13,657 --> 00:33:16,910
You must come. Shige, as well

328
00:33:17,953 --> 00:33:21,373
Yamato is the best place to live

329
00:33:22,666 --> 00:33:26,044
Leave this house to the youngsters!

330
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:29,631
I agree.
Koichi's independent now

331
00:33:30,716 --> 00:33:32,717
I'd love to visit you

332
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,888
Right, I'm going to bed

333
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:41,434
- 'Night all
- Goodnight

334
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,727
Goodnight

335
00:34:16,887 --> 00:34:20,348
Mr Satake was talking to me
about marriage

336
00:34:20,474 --> 00:34:23,017
Uncle was talking
about the same thing, too

337
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:26,521
Really? I'm suddenly very popular!

338
00:34:28,315 --> 00:34:31,526
- So what did your boss say?
- I didn't have time to listen

339
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:33,653
- May I take this hot water?
- Of course

340
00:35:05,811 --> 00:35:08,271
- A visitor for Dr Mamiya
- Who is it?

341
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:10,982
It's a Mrs Tamura from Tsukiji

342
00:35:11,108 --> 00:35:13,151
All right, I'll see her

343
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:17,572
- Any test results yet?
- Not yet

344
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:19,157
That's odd

345
00:35:27,082 --> 00:35:29,751
How do you do? I'm Dr Mamiya

346
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:32,253
Pleased to meet you. I'm Aya's mother

347
00:35:32,379 --> 00:35:34,839
- Have a seat
- Thank you

348
00:35:36,967 --> 00:35:40,178
Your sister Noriko is such
a good friend to my daughter

349
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:42,639
So, I hear you're concerned
about your heart

350
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:47,852
I wanted to ask you
to examine me, Doctor

351
00:35:47,978 --> 00:35:50,021
If I can be of any help

352
00:35:50,147 --> 00:35:55,318
I'm sure you can, but I'm sorry
to bother you when you're so busy

353
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:56,945
Not at all

354
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:58,988
Thank you

355
00:35:59,114 --> 00:36:01,783
By the way,
congratulations about Noriko

356
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:05,203
Aya and I are very happy for her

357
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:08,998
- What do you mean?
- Mr Satake found a man for her

358
00:36:09,124 --> 00:36:10,750
Is that right?

359
00:36:10,876 --> 00:36:13,878
He seems like a fine man

360
00:36:14,004 --> 00:36:17,465
He's the young director of a company
with a very good reputation

361
00:36:17,591 --> 00:36:20,301
- And he's very smart
- I see

362
00:36:20,427 --> 00:36:24,847
He's from a very old family
from Zentsuji in Shikoku

363
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:28,351
They keep up their manor
in the best traditional style

364
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:30,311
I see...

365
00:36:30,437 --> 00:36:33,064
- Well, shall we begin?
- Yes

366
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:39,279
- This way
- Thank you for making time for me

367
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,138
I'm home

368
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:13,146
Welcome home. You're early today

369
00:37:16,775 --> 00:37:18,776
- Is Noriko home yet?
- No

370
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:23,698
- She's at her friend's wedding
- Which one?

371
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:25,700
Chako. You don't know her

372
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:28,578
- The bath's ready
- Good

373
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:31,497
Your father's taking his now

374
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:35,960
That woman from Tsukiji
came in today

375
00:37:36,086 --> 00:37:39,005
Oh, Aya's mother?

376
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,382
She's really something

377
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:45,720
Does she have a bad heart?

378
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:48,514
It's her nose, not her heart

379
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:00,360
How's the bath, Father?

380
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:02,654
Very nice. Just right

381
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,238
Good

382
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:15,291
Mr Satake's friend sounds
like a good match for Noriko

383
00:38:15,417 --> 00:38:16,876
You know about that?

384
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:19,504
That woman from Tsukiji told me

385
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,964
- She said he's a company director
- Really?

386
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,219
He looks like a good man

387
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:29,263
- You've seen him?
- I saw his photograph

388
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:32,100
- Noriko's got a picture of him?
- Yes

389
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:35,436
Isamu, go to your room

390
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:43,861
- What's he like?
- It was a golfing picture, not very clear

391
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:46,698
Go to your room!

392
00:38:52,162 --> 00:38:53,496
Sounds good

393
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:55,665
- I think so, too
- Shall I ask around about him?

394
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:59,252
Yes. I have the feeling that
he could be a good match

395
00:39:00,045 --> 00:39:02,213
Go away, Isamu!

396
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:14,851
- He sounds promising
- I agree

397
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:18,896
...six, seven, eight, nine, ninety

398
00:39:19,022 --> 00:39:23,901
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, one hundred!

399
00:39:24,027 --> 00:39:25,903
That was 200

400
00:39:27,322 --> 00:39:29,031
20 yen!

401
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:31,242
For that, I should get more

402
00:39:31,368 --> 00:39:34,954
Isamu, give grandma
a little extra massage

403
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,498
Is Isamu going to massage me now?

404
00:39:37,624 --> 00:39:39,208
Thank you

405
00:39:39,334 --> 00:39:43,337
With this 20 yen,
I'll have saved 300 yen, Grandma

406
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:48,259
Very good.
But what are you saving for?

407
00:39:48,385 --> 00:39:50,344
A model train track

408
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:53,097
But you already have some

409
00:39:53,223 --> 00:39:56,225
I need more to make
a really long track. Right, Isamu?

410
00:39:56,351 --> 00:39:58,269
I see

411
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:05,610
The bath was good. Just right

412
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:09,906
Father...

413
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:15,495
- Noriko has received a proposal
- Really?

414
00:40:17,956 --> 00:40:21,751
- It seems very promising
- That's good to hear

415
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:24,712
- It's about time she got married
- She's 28 already

416
00:40:24,838 --> 00:40:28,257
That's right.
I hope it's a good match

417
00:40:28,383 --> 00:40:31,344
I think so.
I'll ask around about him

418
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:36,140
Yes, do that. And right away

419
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:59,288
- It's not fair to say that
- You don't think so?

420
00:40:59,414 --> 00:41:03,751
- Any bride would be like that
- But I've never seen her like that

421
00:41:03,877 --> 00:41:06,754
Yes, putting on airs, looking all prim

422
00:41:12,135 --> 00:41:14,679
- Where was your honeymoon?
- Chuzenji

423
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:16,514
We went to Atami

424
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,768
It started raining that very day.
We couldn't go out for three days

425
00:41:20,894 --> 00:41:25,064
It rained solidly every day. We didn't
know what to do with ourselves

426
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:28,234
Mari, why are you telling us this?

427
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:31,153
Just a documentary report

428
00:41:32,155 --> 00:41:35,449
We asked a hotel employee
for a top

429
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:37,660
- A top?
- Yes, you know?

430
00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:39,871
A spinning top painted with flags

431
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:42,540
- We passed the time playing with it
- Oh, really?

432
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:46,961
- My husband's very good at it...
- Really? Oh, really?

433
00:41:48,046 --> 00:41:51,465
You shouldn’t flaunt it
in front of the single girls

434
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:55,636
How silly! We don't play
with spinning tops, do we?

435
00:41:55,762 --> 00:41:58,681
We're not children, are we?

436
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:02,810
Single girls just don't understand,
do they?

437
00:42:02,936 --> 00:42:06,606
- No, they don't
- You have to feel sorry for them

438
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:09,692
Takako! How can you say that?

439
00:42:09,818 --> 00:42:12,570
- What is it?
- She has no right

440
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:15,156
Right, I'm leaving

441
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:27,251
Single people don't know
what real happiness is

442
00:42:27,377 --> 00:42:29,462
They have no right to talk

443
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:32,840
Look who's talking, Mrs Carrot!

444
00:42:32,966 --> 00:42:34,508
Single people have no say!

445
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:38,220
You always go on about happiness,
but it's just anticipation

446
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:42,266
Like before you go to the races,
planning which horse to bet on

447
00:42:42,392 --> 00:42:45,811
Then dreaming about
how you’ll spend your winnings

448
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:48,272
You're wrong. You don't know

449
00:42:48,398 --> 00:42:49,607
You don't know

450
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:51,901
- You too?
- Don't back down!

451
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:55,029
- I'm leaving, too
- Leave, you dreamers!

452
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:03,162
Shall we go to Kamakura,
to Noriko's?

453
00:43:03,288 --> 00:43:05,748
Please do.
It's a beautiful season

454
00:43:06,416 --> 00:43:08,000
How about Sunday after next?

455
00:43:08,126 --> 00:43:10,962
Sounds good.
How about you, Aya?

456
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:15,174
I can go anytime,
because I'm not married. Right?

457
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:17,343
She's at it again!

458
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:43,119
I'm home!

459
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:44,495
Noriko?

460
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:46,956
- Shall I lock the door?
- Yes

461
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:59,218
- Finally home!
- Welcome

462
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:03,097
- How was Chako?
- She looked so lovely

463
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:04,807
The reception was magnificent

464
00:44:08,311 --> 00:44:11,272
- Was she in Western dress?
- No, a kimono

465
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:15,609
Would you like to try a bit?

466
00:44:16,278 --> 00:44:17,820
What is it?

467
00:44:19,364 --> 00:44:22,450
Shortcake! It looks delicious

468
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:24,702
I went to the Ginza with some friends

469
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:31,292
They're coming to Kamakura
next Sunday

470
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:33,878
Really?
I'll cook something special

471
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:35,546
Please have some

472
00:44:38,091 --> 00:44:40,259
- You don't want any?
- I've had enough

473
00:44:40,385 --> 00:44:41,510
Thank you

474
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:49,894
My friends are funny.
We always split into two groups...

475
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,229
...the married and the single

476
00:44:52,355 --> 00:44:55,441
- Aya got all worked up again
- How come?

477
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:59,445
Because the married ones
look down on us for being single

478
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:01,655
Why not get married, then?

479
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:03,574
- You're on their side?
- Of course

480
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,076
Oh, dear!

481
00:45:06,369 --> 00:45:08,120
I'll think about it, then

482
00:45:08,246 --> 00:45:11,916
You should. How about the man
Mr Satake suggested?

483
00:45:13,126 --> 00:45:15,377
He sounds nice

484
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:17,671
Mr Satake speaks very highly of him

485
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:35,314
Oh! You scared me!

486
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:38,776
Were you awake all this time?

487
00:45:41,279 --> 00:45:43,864
She doesn't seem against the idea

488
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:48,035
I know. I think it's a possibility

489
00:45:49,704 --> 00:45:52,414
She may accept. Try and ask her

490
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:03,467
This cake tastes really good

491
00:46:03,593 --> 00:46:05,052
Is it?

492
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,975
- I'll buy more next time
- Please do

493
00:46:24,781 --> 00:46:27,283
Noriko can be stubborn
so be tactful

494
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:30,077
I know. Leave it to me

495
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:35,332
Tell her that her father approves,
but don't press her too much

496
00:46:35,458 --> 00:46:37,459
Don't worry

497
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:39,920
Do your best, all right?

498
00:47:20,462 --> 00:47:21,921
Hello?

499
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:26,926
- Hello?
- Who is it?

500
00:47:28,553 --> 00:47:31,430
Hello. Long time no see

501
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:34,892
Ah, Aunt Tami. Come in

502
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:37,102
Very well. Thank you

503
00:47:43,401 --> 00:47:46,445
Sorry I haven't seen you
for such a long time

504
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:49,406
Where's Koichi's wife?

505
00:47:49,532 --> 00:47:53,202
She went shopping.
Please make your self comfortable

506
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:56,956
Here's something for you
from my hometown

507
00:47:58,166 --> 00:48:00,501
I hope you like it.
It arrived this morning

508
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:03,170
You're always very kind

509
00:48:03,296 --> 00:48:05,547
Oh, it's nothing

510
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:11,553
We had a strange visitor
this morning

511
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,514
Oh? Who was it?

512
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:17,351
I'd never seen him before

513
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:22,564
A man with parted hair,
glasses and a black bag

514
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:27,027
At first, I thought
he was from the tax office

515
00:48:27,153 --> 00:48:29,947
- But I was wrong
- Who was he?

516
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:33,701
He was from one of those
reference agencies

517
00:48:34,869 --> 00:48:37,913
He asked me questions
about Noriko

518
00:48:38,039 --> 00:48:39,290
Did he really?

519
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:43,377
Then I realised that it must be
about her marriage

520
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:45,879
They're doing a background check

521
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:49,258
- I asked him who was interested
- Did you?

522
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:52,970
He just scratched his head
and tried to laugh it off

523
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:56,682
I got so annoyed, I told him
he'd never find a better girl

524
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:59,101
I gave him what for!

525
00:48:59,227 --> 00:49:01,228
Oh, my!

526
00:49:01,354 --> 00:49:06,108
Turns out, that horrible little man
knew quite a lot

527
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:10,696
He even knew that both our sons
were classmates...

528
00:49:10,822 --> 00:49:12,656
Oh, hello

529
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:14,825
Welcome

530
00:49:14,951 --> 00:49:17,911
Thank you for being so kind
to Kenkichi

531
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:19,830
And how are you?

532
00:49:19,956 --> 00:49:21,707
I'm fine, thank you

533
00:49:27,005 --> 00:49:30,424
Your son has become a fine doctor

534
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:36,388
Thank you, but all he does
since his wife died is read books

535
00:49:36,514 --> 00:49:40,559
- It's been two years, hasn't it?
- Yes. How time flies

536
00:49:43,813 --> 00:49:48,609
- What about your son Shoji?
- He won't be coming back

537
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:51,320
Some people have returned
recently from the south

538
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:54,281
I've given up hope

539
00:49:54,407 --> 00:49:55,866
There you go

540
00:50:00,830 --> 00:50:03,916
My wife still thinks
he's alive somewhere

541
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:07,669
I know how it is. You can't help it

542
00:50:08,838 --> 00:50:13,217
Every day, she listens to
the Missing Persons Hour on the radio

543
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:20,099
It's funny how our memories work

544
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:23,060
I forget about recent things...

545
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:27,564
...yet I remember everything
about Shoji so vividly

546
00:50:29,567 --> 00:50:32,486
He won't be coming home

547
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:51,004
PHYSICIAN

548
00:51:06,604 --> 00:51:08,730
You were stationed
in Zentsuji, right?

549
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:10,315
That's right

550
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:14,486
Ever hear of a man called Manabe?

551
00:51:14,612 --> 00:51:16,655
No. Who is he?

552
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:19,199
Never mind

553
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:26,206
- Sakaguchi was at Zentsuji
- Was he really?

554
00:51:26,332 --> 00:51:29,543
He might know him.
He knows a lot of people

555
00:51:32,755 --> 00:51:34,840
That's a stalemate position

556
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:38,177
- Was this here?
- No, it was there

557
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:47,895
There are so many kids
around here now

558
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:50,314
It's extra noisy on Sundays

559
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:53,817
My house is filled with them today

560
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,112
I can't stay in that position

561
00:51:58,948 --> 00:52:01,241
Watch your legs! Careful!

562
00:52:03,536 --> 00:52:04,995
There it goes!

563
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:10,834
More speed

564
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,419
Here it comes!

565
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:16,381
- Coming!
- Almost!

566
00:52:21,971 --> 00:52:24,431
- Is this ready?
- Yes, take it in

567
00:52:28,853 --> 00:52:30,729
What a crowd!

568
00:52:32,273 --> 00:52:34,066
Lunch, everyone

569
00:52:34,192 --> 00:52:35,943
Sandwiches for lunch!

570
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:40,113
Sandwiches!
Let's eat on the terrace

571
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:44,451
Don't step on the tracks!

572
00:52:44,577 --> 00:52:46,203
Here, take this

573
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:50,666
Buy me some more track, Mum

574
00:52:50,792 --> 00:52:52,251
You have enough

575
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:55,754
It belongs to my friends.
I only have eight pieces

576
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:58,966
- Buy me some more
- Why not use your pocket money?

577
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:03,720
It's not enough.
I want to make it longer. Right, Isamu?

578
00:53:03,846 --> 00:53:06,431
- Buy me more, Mum
- I'll ask Father

579
00:53:06,558 --> 00:53:08,267
Ask him, then

580
00:53:08,393 --> 00:53:12,104
Tell him it's 32mm-gauge.
Don't forget!

581
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:14,189
- You're so crafty
- Shut up!

582
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:18,068
- Will you buy me some?
- No way

583
00:53:23,866 --> 00:53:25,325
Hello?

584
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:28,495
- Welcome
- Hello

585
00:53:28,621 --> 00:53:31,957
- Mari called to say she can't come
- Really?

586
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:34,418
- Has Takako come yet?
- No

587
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:36,461
Oh, what a crowd!

588
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:42,843
Just look at that!

589
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:44,428
Just go away!

590
00:53:49,934 --> 00:53:52,686
- Hello
- Welcome. Please come in

591
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:01,111
How lovely

592
00:54:01,237 --> 00:54:04,948
- A little something for your mother
- Thank you very much

593
00:54:10,955 --> 00:54:13,373
The sky's so beautiful here

594
00:54:14,876 --> 00:54:17,377
I can't even see the sky where I live!

595
00:54:17,503 --> 00:54:20,505
- Where's your father?
- The museum with my mother

596
00:54:21,924 --> 00:54:23,133
What did Mari say?

597
00:54:23,259 --> 00:54:26,345
Her husband's going away on business.
She really wanted to come

598
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:27,971
I see...

599
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:38,023
How inconvenient.
If I were her, I'd have come

600
00:54:38,149 --> 00:54:40,150
It's not that simple for her

601
00:54:40,902 --> 00:54:44,738
She could have come.
She has a maid to help her

602
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:49,117
Maybe a wife has other worries

603
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:52,162
- We single women wouldn't know
- Right!

604
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:57,459
Help yourself

605
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:01,672
Kamakura is such a nice place

606
00:55:03,758 --> 00:55:06,134
I wish I could live here

607
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:08,929
Noriko, phone call for you!

608
00:55:16,270 --> 00:55:18,021
- From Oiso
- Is it?

609
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:21,983
Hello? Takako? What is it?

610
00:55:24,028 --> 00:55:25,654
Really?

611
00:55:27,323 --> 00:55:28,865
I see...

612
00:55:41,963 --> 00:55:45,882
Takako just called. She's in Oiso

613
00:55:46,008 --> 00:55:47,467
Oiso?

614
00:55:49,637 --> 00:55:51,555
Her father's sick

615
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:56,852
That's not true. He's on a trip,
I read it in the newspaper

616
00:55:56,978 --> 00:55:58,061
Is that so?

617
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:11,116
This party was her idea as well

618
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:14,911
I wonder why she didn't come

619
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:18,457
We've been dumped

620
00:56:22,837 --> 00:56:24,921
Because we're fussy, right?

621
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:31,428
We were such close friends
in school

622
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:34,264
Now we're slowly drifting apart

623
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:40,353
Can't be helped.
That's how it is, it seems

624
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,355
I can't bear it

625
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,777
Shall we go to the beach later?

626
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:48,111
Yes, shall we?

627
00:56:48,237 --> 00:56:50,697
- Have something to eat
- Let's eat

628
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:54,910
Pass me the juice

629
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:38,787
This may be the happiest time
for our family

630
00:57:40,206 --> 00:57:44,626
We'll be sad when Noriko leaves us
to get married

631
00:57:44,752 --> 00:57:46,253
You're right

632
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:50,257
What do you think
of Mr Satake's plan?

633
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:54,636
I hope it works out.
It's time she got married

634
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:14,948
How time flies

635
00:58:15,074 --> 00:58:19,703
Koichi got married,
our grandchildren were born...

636
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:22,414
...and now Noriko's getting married

637
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:25,500
This may be the happiest time
of our lives

638
00:58:25,626 --> 00:58:27,335
You think so?

639
00:58:27,461 --> 00:58:30,881
But we'll still have happy times

640
00:58:32,133 --> 00:58:34,301
We mustn't ask for too much

641
00:58:39,056 --> 00:58:40,891
I've really enjoyed today

642
00:58:43,144 --> 00:58:44,603
Look

643
00:58:59,368 --> 00:59:01,745
Some child somewhere
must be crying

644
00:59:03,998 --> 00:59:06,958
Remember how Koichi cried
when he lost his balloon?

645
00:59:39,283 --> 00:59:42,410
Hello? Hello. Yes, it is

646
00:59:43,537 --> 00:59:46,373
- It's from home
- Oh, thanks

647
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:57,300
Hello? Fumiko? It's me

648
00:59:57,426 --> 01:00:01,346
I have to stay tonight
to keep watch on a patient

649
01:00:01,472 --> 01:00:03,598
Is Noriko home? I see

650
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:08,979
Her prospects seem very good.
Sakaguchi told me

651
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:12,357
I'll tell you when I get home

652
01:00:12,483 --> 01:00:16,027
All right. I understand

653
01:00:16,153 --> 01:00:17,779
What? Oh, I see

654
01:00:18,656 --> 01:00:19,739
Goodnight

655
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:27,372
- Is he staying over?
- Yes

656
01:00:27,498 --> 01:00:30,750
How marvellous. It looks delicious

657
01:00:30,876 --> 01:00:33,086
- How much was it?
- 900 yen

658
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:35,797
- 900 yen? That?
- Yes

659
01:00:35,923 --> 01:00:39,968
For that? That's so expensive!

660
01:00:40,094 --> 01:00:42,137
- Is it their usual price?
- Yes

661
01:00:48,185 --> 01:00:49,936
I've lost my appetite

662
01:00:50,062 --> 01:00:52,731
Come on, pass me the plates

663
01:00:52,857 --> 01:00:55,108
I shouldn’t have asked you

664
01:00:55,234 --> 01:00:56,818
The plates, the plates!

665
01:00:56,944 --> 01:01:02,532
I feel terrible. I shouldn’t have
asked you to buy it

666
01:01:07,246 --> 01:01:09,456
Will you pay for half of it?

667
01:01:09,582 --> 01:01:11,916
Me? Forget it

668
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:14,753
- I will, I will!
- You're serious?

669
01:01:16,213 --> 01:01:18,214
Here

670
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:21,760
- It's so expensive, though
- But this bakery is the best

671
01:01:21,886 --> 01:01:24,679
It costs as much
as half a pound of wool

672
01:01:25,639 --> 01:01:27,766
But it's a rare occasion, I suppose

673
01:01:38,486 --> 01:01:40,361
- Good evening!
- Who is it?

674
01:01:40,488 --> 01:01:41,946
It's Yabe

675
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:47,202
- Welcome
- Tonight your brother...

676
01:01:47,328 --> 01:01:50,580
- He just called, he's staying overnight
- I see

677
01:01:50,706 --> 01:01:53,458
- Please come in
- Thank you

678
01:01:59,381 --> 01:02:00,882
Good evening

679
01:02:01,008 --> 01:02:02,258
Here you are

680
01:02:02,384 --> 01:02:05,178
- Thank you for stopping by
- Not at all

681
01:02:05,304 --> 01:02:07,472
- Where are your parents?
- Gone to bed

682
01:02:07,598 --> 01:02:08,723
Please

683
01:02:08,849 --> 01:02:11,935
My timing was good.
You don't mind me having this?

684
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:13,520
Please do

685
01:02:16,315 --> 01:02:18,733
- Are you celebrating something?
- Why?

686
01:02:19,985 --> 01:02:22,278
Do you eat cake like this often?

687
01:02:23,614 --> 01:02:25,281
Not that often

688
01:02:25,407 --> 01:02:27,283
I wish I could

689
01:02:28,744 --> 01:02:30,745
- May I?
- Please

690
01:02:36,418 --> 01:02:37,961
It must've cost a lot

691
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:41,005
It was quite reasonable, right?

692
01:02:41,132 --> 01:02:43,216
It was cheap, so don't worry

693
01:02:46,637 --> 01:02:48,513
It's good

694
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:51,099
Noriko, I believe
congratulations are in order

695
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:53,601
Really?

696
01:02:55,312 --> 01:02:56,729
So I've heard

697
01:02:56,856 --> 01:03:00,191
Really? How wonderful.
What's the occasion?

698
01:03:00,818 --> 01:03:02,902
I'm right, aren't I?

699
01:03:03,028 --> 01:03:04,487
Maybe...

700
01:03:06,198 --> 01:03:08,658
- And you too, I hear
- Me?

701
01:03:08,784 --> 01:03:12,787
- Your mother said so
- That's just an idea in her head

702
01:03:13,831 --> 01:03:17,292
I think you should remarry.
Shouldn't he?

703
01:03:17,418 --> 01:03:20,628
Yes, it would be good
for little Mitsuko, too

704
01:03:20,754 --> 01:03:25,216
- I heard the lady's really nice
- Mother's just getting all excited

705
01:03:30,014 --> 01:03:33,516
Are you not going to eat that?
If not, I will

706
01:03:33,642 --> 01:03:37,020
- I certainly am!
- Are you sure? Too bad

707
01:03:39,648 --> 01:03:41,107
It's so good

708
01:03:42,401 --> 01:03:44,110
Hide the cake

709
01:04:06,550 --> 01:04:07,884
What is it?

710
01:04:09,595 --> 01:04:11,304
Evening, Minoru

711
01:04:50,261 --> 01:04:51,719
I'm home

712
01:04:53,555 --> 01:04:58,768
Hi, Dad

713
01:05:02,147 --> 01:05:04,232
Great!

714
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:07,485
Look, Mum! Great!

715
01:05:08,279 --> 01:05:09,737
Welcome home

716
01:05:13,325 --> 01:05:16,995
Isamu, dad bought us some track!

717
01:05:17,121 --> 01:05:19,664
This is great!

718
01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:21,040
Great!

719
01:05:23,335 --> 01:05:25,044
Hands off and wait!

720
01:05:26,755 --> 01:05:29,674
Dad's great! Let's see

721
01:05:32,886 --> 01:05:34,595
What's this?

722
01:05:34,722 --> 01:05:36,973
- Bread
- Shut up!

723
01:05:48,902 --> 01:05:49,944
Idiot!

724
01:05:51,363 --> 01:05:53,865
- Where's mother?
- In the bathroom?

725
01:05:53,991 --> 01:05:55,325
Mother?

726
01:05:58,704 --> 01:06:00,288
My belt...

727
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:09,881
The proposal for Noriko
seems very promising

728
01:06:10,007 --> 01:06:12,633
That's very good

729
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:16,512
Sakaguchi says the man is
from a very good family in Zentsuji

730
01:06:16,638 --> 01:06:18,681
- He is the second son
- Really?

731
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:23,686
He's in the social register
and seems to be a fine businessman

732
01:06:23,812 --> 01:06:28,399
I see. How nice.
And how old is he?

733
01:06:28,525 --> 01:06:32,653
He was born in the 43rd year
of the Meiji Era, so he's...42

734
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:36,199
- 42?
- That's about right

735
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:39,410
- Forties, huh?
- He's that much older than Noriko?

736
01:06:39,536 --> 01:06:41,371
Age doesn't matter!

737
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:47,085
- But that's too old for Noriko
- That's right

738
01:06:47,211 --> 01:06:49,379
So what age is good?

739
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:51,881
Noriko's not so young herself

740
01:06:52,007 --> 01:06:55,051
She can't be too choosy
or she'll never get married

741
01:06:57,971 --> 01:07:02,475
As long as he's respectable,
we shouldn’t be picky

742
01:07:02,601 --> 01:07:05,561
I just feel sorry for her

743
01:07:05,687 --> 01:07:08,648
Sorry for her? Why?

744
01:07:08,774 --> 01:07:10,983
What do you mean?

745
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:16,072
With that kind of attitude,
you’ll spoil things for Noriko

746
01:07:17,074 --> 01:07:21,536
- I wonder...
- Yes, you will

747
01:07:21,662 --> 01:07:26,457
Aren't you asking for too much?
You always do this

748
01:07:28,377 --> 01:07:31,087
- Yes, but...
- But what?

749
01:07:31,213 --> 01:07:33,756
What does Noriko think?

750
01:07:33,882 --> 01:07:37,677
- You said she'd accept
- Yes, but...

751
01:07:37,803 --> 01:07:39,720
Didn't you tell me that?

752
01:07:39,847 --> 01:07:42,473
- You said so
- But it was you who...

753
01:07:42,599 --> 01:07:46,227
Idiot! Stop twisting things around!

754
01:07:54,945 --> 01:07:58,239
Am I asking for too much?

755
01:08:57,049 --> 01:08:58,132
What's wrong?

756
01:08:59,468 --> 01:09:01,469
He scolded me

757
01:09:01,595 --> 01:09:02,929
It's all right

758
01:09:05,849 --> 01:09:08,476
We're all just concerned for Noriko

759
01:09:11,188 --> 01:09:13,314
Don't worry about it

760
01:09:35,879 --> 01:09:38,339
Liar! Liar!

761
01:09:38,465 --> 01:09:42,134
I wanted train track, not that!

762
01:09:45,389 --> 01:09:46,931
Stop that!

763
01:09:47,057 --> 01:09:48,641
This stupid thing!

764
01:09:48,767 --> 01:09:50,184
Stop that!

765
01:09:51,562 --> 01:09:54,647
Why did you do that?
You do not kick food around!

766
01:09:54,773 --> 01:09:56,274
Liar!

767
01:10:00,445 --> 01:10:02,154
That's a bad thing to do!

768
01:10:02,281 --> 01:10:05,241
- You understand?
- Let me go!

769
01:10:16,628 --> 01:10:18,212
Isamu, come here!

770
01:10:23,051 --> 01:10:24,093
I'm home!

771
01:10:24,219 --> 01:10:27,096
Where are you going?
Have you been scolded?

772
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:31,309
- Where are you going?
- I don't know

773
01:10:44,114 --> 01:10:45,740
I'm home

774
01:10:45,866 --> 01:10:47,950
Did you scold them again?

775
01:10:50,996 --> 01:10:52,955
You're in a bad mood

776
01:10:53,081 --> 01:10:56,250
You shouldn’t scold them
when you're angry

777
01:10:57,210 --> 01:11:00,963
- I feel sorry for them
- Why?

778
01:11:01,089 --> 01:11:04,925
- They've grown scared of you
- Don't lecture me

779
01:11:05,052 --> 01:11:07,845
I'm not lecturing you.
You're always...

780
01:11:07,971 --> 01:11:10,723
Just mind your own business

781
01:11:11,558 --> 01:11:13,142
Very well

782
01:11:17,939 --> 01:11:20,066
- I'm home
- Welcome back

783
01:11:20,192 --> 01:11:21,984
He's in a bad mood, isn't he?

784
01:12:09,991 --> 01:12:12,785
Idiot! Idiot!

785
01:12:17,624 --> 01:12:20,126
Isamu! Come on!

786
01:12:57,414 --> 01:12:59,749
Where can they be?

787
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:04,295
Where, indeed?
They'll be getting hungry now

788
01:13:05,088 --> 01:13:07,965
Yes, they will be. Poor things

789
01:13:21,271 --> 01:13:23,063
Aren't they back yet?

790
01:13:23,190 --> 01:13:25,566
Not yet.
Where could they have got to?

791
01:13:25,692 --> 01:13:27,777
It's getting late

792
01:13:33,241 --> 01:13:35,326
I'll go and have another look

793
01:13:38,121 --> 01:13:40,498
- But, Father...
- No, I'm going

794
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:53,052
Good evening. Anybody in?

795
01:13:53,845 --> 01:13:56,055
- Is that you, Noriko?
- Yes

796
01:13:58,809 --> 01:14:01,685
Did our boys come here?

797
01:14:01,812 --> 01:14:03,896
- No
- They didn't?

798
01:14:04,022 --> 01:14:07,024
No. What's wrong?

799
01:14:07,859 --> 01:14:10,069
They've been out all day
and still aren't back

800
01:14:10,195 --> 01:14:13,155
Really? Where can they be?

801
01:14:15,534 --> 01:14:16,784
What's up?

802
01:14:16,910 --> 01:14:20,204
- Will you help her find the boys?
- All right

803
01:14:20,330 --> 01:14:21,872
- Let's go
- Thank you

804
01:14:21,998 --> 01:14:25,626
- Those sandals have got holes in
- They're fine

805
01:14:25,752 --> 01:14:29,004
It's dark out, be careful!

806
01:14:29,130 --> 01:14:32,299
Check the road
that goes towards Hase

807
01:14:32,425 --> 01:14:35,803
And don't forget
to check the train station

808
01:14:35,929 --> 01:14:38,305
And the back lanes, too!

809
01:14:51,987 --> 01:14:54,280
- Your turn
- Is it?

810
01:14:58,702 --> 01:15:01,203
Why did you get so angry with them?

811
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:09,086
Don't be too harsh on them.
Children are sensitive

812
01:15:12,090 --> 01:15:14,258
You shouldn’t lose your temper

813
01:15:15,510 --> 01:15:17,177
I know I shouldn’t

814
01:15:21,266 --> 01:15:25,769
- It's not easy
- Right, it's not easy

815
01:15:37,198 --> 01:15:39,783
Hello? Yes?

816
01:15:40,577 --> 01:15:43,662
Ah, Mrs Mamiya? How are you?

817
01:15:44,414 --> 01:15:45,956
Yes, he's here

818
01:15:46,082 --> 01:15:47,708
- For me?
- Yes, your wife

819
01:15:49,210 --> 01:15:50,836
Hello? It's me

820
01:15:52,714 --> 01:15:55,758
Really? They're home?

821
01:15:58,762 --> 01:16:00,304
That's good

822
01:16:02,557 --> 01:16:05,559
I see. I'll be home soon

823
01:16:12,609 --> 01:16:16,028
- They're home
- Thank goodness

824
01:16:16,154 --> 01:16:19,490
They were starving
and just sitting in the train station

825
01:16:19,616 --> 01:16:22,618
- Poor boys
- They're such a bother

826
01:16:24,537 --> 01:16:26,956
- I'll be off
- Yes, you'd better

827
01:16:33,254 --> 01:16:35,923
They take after me more and more

828
01:16:36,049 --> 01:16:38,926
But only my bad side, unfortunately

829
01:16:39,052 --> 01:16:40,928
That's just how it goes

830
01:16:41,471 --> 01:16:43,931
- Don't forget our conversation
- What?

831
01:16:44,057 --> 01:16:48,310
They want that position
at Akita Hospital filled right away

832
01:16:51,106 --> 01:16:54,108
I'll ask him tomorrow

833
01:16:54,234 --> 01:16:55,818
- See you
- All right

834
01:16:55,944 --> 01:16:57,319
- Goodnight
- Let me know

835
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:18,841
I'm home

836
01:17:21,302 --> 01:17:23,429
Mitsuko, my good little girl

837
01:17:25,265 --> 01:17:27,099
You mustn't go outside

838
01:17:36,526 --> 01:17:39,236
You're early. Are you hungry?

839
01:17:39,362 --> 01:17:41,613
- There's fried rice
- Fine

840
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:43,115
- Mother?
- What?

841
01:17:43,241 --> 01:17:46,076
- I have something to tell you
- What is it?

842
01:17:46,202 --> 01:17:48,203
Come and sit down

843
01:17:50,957 --> 01:17:52,166
What is it?

844
01:17:54,169 --> 01:17:57,796
- I'm thinking of going to Akita
- Akita? On a business trip?

845
01:17:57,922 --> 01:18:01,258
They've asked me to run the internal
medicine department at Akita Hospital

846
01:18:01,384 --> 01:18:03,886
- They asked you?
- Yes

847
01:18:04,012 --> 01:18:06,346
The offer came through Mr Mamiya

848
01:18:06,473 --> 01:18:10,809
He told me I'd be called back
to Tokyo in a few years

849
01:18:10,935 --> 01:18:13,687
What do you think?

850
01:18:13,813 --> 01:18:17,274
I'd like to go.
But I can always go on my own

851
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:20,778
- You can't do that!
- Will you come with me then?

852
01:18:23,073 --> 01:18:26,158
- How about it?
- Well...

853
01:18:27,368 --> 01:18:28,744
It's far away

854
01:18:29,412 --> 01:18:32,456
Not keen? I'd get a big raise

855
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:37,419
Can't you find a job like that
in Tokyo?

856
01:18:37,545 --> 01:18:40,964
No, posts like that are only
in the provinces

857
01:18:41,091 --> 01:18:43,592
Listen, Mother,
it's a great opportunity for me

858
01:18:44,219 --> 01:18:45,928
I know that, but...

859
01:18:46,054 --> 01:18:51,391
And I can do my research
on local problems there

860
01:18:51,518 --> 01:18:55,729
They promised I could return
to Tokyo in three or four years

861
01:18:58,650 --> 01:19:02,194
I don't know when I might get
another opportunity like this

862
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:04,488
What do you think, Mother?

863
01:19:06,491 --> 01:19:07,991
I'll accept, all right?

864
01:19:16,417 --> 01:19:20,462
You have a bad habit of going quiet
when you're angry, Mother

865
01:19:51,077 --> 01:19:52,494
Yes?

866
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,544
- Hello
- Hello. What is it today?

867
01:20:01,504 --> 01:20:05,132
- I was just in the neighbourhood
- Well, have a seat

868
01:20:10,722 --> 01:20:13,098
- Where's Noriko?
- She's out

869
01:20:14,309 --> 01:20:18,520
- Mr Manabe came by last night
- Did he say anything?

870
01:20:18,646 --> 01:20:20,022
Not much

871
01:20:22,192 --> 01:20:25,903
- What about Noriko?
- What about her?

872
01:20:26,029 --> 01:20:29,406
- Marrying Mr Manabe
- She hasn't said anything yet

873
01:20:29,532 --> 01:20:30,908
I see...

874
01:20:33,244 --> 01:20:37,664
- Will you ask her about it?
- Me?

875
01:20:37,790 --> 01:20:40,959
- I don't understand her
- What do you mean?

876
01:20:41,085 --> 01:20:45,756
- Is she interested in men?
- What do you think?

877
01:20:45,882 --> 01:20:49,843
Sometimes she seems to be,
and sometimes she doesn't

878
01:20:49,969 --> 01:20:52,137
- Has she always been like that?
- Yes

879
01:20:52,263 --> 01:20:55,641
- Has she ever been in love?
- I don't think so

880
01:20:55,767 --> 01:20:59,061
But she used to have an album
of Katharine Hepburn photos this thick

881
01:20:59,187 --> 01:21:00,646
Who's Hepburn?

882
01:21:00,772 --> 01:21:03,148
- The American actress
- A woman?

883
01:21:03,274 --> 01:21:04,816
- Yes
- Is she queer?

884
01:21:04,943 --> 01:21:06,151
No way!

885
01:21:06,277 --> 01:21:09,571
You can never know.
She's very strange, in any case

886
01:21:11,366 --> 01:21:14,034
- Why don't you teach her?
- About what?

887
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:16,954
- Everything
- What do you mean, everything?

888
01:21:18,248 --> 01:21:19,790
Don't try to be coy

889
01:21:19,916 --> 01:21:21,959
Don't talk to me like that!

890
01:21:25,505 --> 01:21:27,756
- That's rude!
- Sorry

891
01:21:30,426 --> 01:21:32,469
Bring some tea

892
01:21:32,595 --> 01:21:33,971
Or some coffee?

893
01:21:34,097 --> 01:21:35,847
Nothing, thank you

894
01:21:42,438 --> 01:21:44,022
Noriko's late

895
01:21:44,148 --> 01:21:47,859
She might not be back today.
She's seeing her brother

896
01:21:48,778 --> 01:21:53,198
That was mean of you.
You could’ve told me sooner

897
01:21:54,826 --> 01:21:57,703
- How about going out for some sushi?
- All right

898
01:21:57,829 --> 01:22:00,080
- What is your favourite sushi?
- Tuna

899
01:22:00,206 --> 01:22:03,125
- Tuna? How about an open clam?
- Sure

900
01:22:03,251 --> 01:22:05,961
- And a rice roll?
- No way

901
01:22:06,087 --> 01:22:08,422
You're a strange one, too

902
01:22:50,798 --> 01:22:53,967
Shoji and I often used to come here
when we were students

903
01:22:55,219 --> 01:22:58,347
- Did you?
- We always sat at this table

904
01:22:58,473 --> 01:23:01,641
- Really?
- That painting was there, too

905
01:23:07,231 --> 01:23:09,358
Time flies, doesn't it?

906
01:23:09,484 --> 01:23:10,859
It does

907
01:23:13,154 --> 01:23:17,115
We quarrelled a lot,
but I loved my brother very much

908
01:23:19,786 --> 01:23:21,620
I still have a letter from him

909
01:23:21,746 --> 01:23:25,707
It came through the military post.
He'd enclosed a wheat stalk

910
01:23:27,919 --> 01:23:29,961
At that time, I was reading
Wheat And Soldiers

911
01:23:32,131 --> 01:23:36,343
- Could you let me have it?
- Of course. I'd like you to have it

912
01:23:36,469 --> 01:23:39,137
Thank you. Oh, there he is

913
01:23:42,934 --> 01:23:45,185
- Been waiting long?
- Not too long

914
01:23:47,146 --> 01:23:51,817
- Shall we go? What shall we eat?
- I'll eat anything

915
01:23:51,943 --> 01:23:54,945
It's your farewell dinner,
make him treat you

916
01:23:55,071 --> 01:23:58,615
Of course.
But nothing too expensive

917
01:23:59,992 --> 01:24:03,412
- Stingy!
- Expensive dishes aren't always good

918
01:24:04,455 --> 01:24:05,956
Shall we go?

919
01:24:40,116 --> 01:24:42,576
- Good evening
- Who is it?

920
01:24:45,496 --> 01:24:49,374
- It's me
- Ah, Noriko?

921
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:52,919
Welcome. Please come in

922
01:24:54,505 --> 01:24:56,465
Thanks

923
01:25:05,224 --> 01:25:07,350
- Mitsuko's fast asleep
- Yes

924
01:25:10,771 --> 01:25:11,897
You're packing?

925
01:25:13,149 --> 01:25:15,901
I'm not making much headway, though

926
01:25:20,323 --> 01:25:23,575
This is a little farewell gift
from my family

927
01:25:23,701 --> 01:25:27,496
Oh, you shouldn’t have.
You're very kind

928
01:25:27,622 --> 01:25:29,956
Thank you very much

929
01:25:30,082 --> 01:25:31,374
Where's Kenkichi?

930
01:25:32,251 --> 01:25:37,547
Still at his farewell party
even though he's off tomorrow

931
01:25:37,673 --> 01:25:39,257
When will you join him?

932
01:25:39,383 --> 01:25:42,135
As soon as I finish
cleaning this place up

933
01:25:42,261 --> 01:25:44,137
It must be hard work

934
01:25:50,311 --> 01:25:52,687
Thanks for all your kindness
over the years

935
01:25:55,233 --> 01:25:58,527
- Is this your first trip to Akita?
- Yes

936
01:25:58,653 --> 01:26:03,448
The furthest north I've been
is Utsunomiya

937
01:26:03,574 --> 01:26:05,075
I see

938
01:26:05,201 --> 01:26:07,994
You’ll be back in a few years

939
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:10,580
That's what Kenkichi says, too

940
01:26:10,706 --> 01:26:13,959
- It's true
- I hope he's right

941
01:26:15,044 --> 01:26:17,921
I wanted him to get remarried...

942
01:26:18,047 --> 01:26:20,799
...and then we could live
the rest of our lives here

943
01:26:23,177 --> 01:26:24,553
Actually...

944
01:26:25,846 --> 01:26:29,599
I hope you won't be offended,
and please don't tell Kenkichi

945
01:26:29,725 --> 01:26:31,893
- What is it?
- Well...

946
01:26:34,021 --> 01:26:36,898
I know it's an impossible dream...

947
01:26:37,024 --> 01:26:41,027
...but I just wish Kenkichi had
got married to someone like you

948
01:26:41,153 --> 01:26:43,989
- That's what I thought
- Really?

949
01:26:44,115 --> 01:26:48,493
I'm sorry.
It's just a wish in my heart

950
01:26:48,619 --> 01:26:49,953
Please don't be angry with me

951
01:26:50,913 --> 01:26:53,540
- Do you mean it?
- What?

952
01:26:54,625 --> 01:26:57,335
Do you really feel
that way about me?

953
01:26:57,461 --> 01:27:01,631
Forgive me, I didn't mean
to hurt your feelings

954
01:27:02,341 --> 01:27:06,094
You wouldn’t mind
an old maid like me?

955
01:27:08,973 --> 01:27:10,473
Then I accept

956
01:27:11,475 --> 01:27:13,310
- Really?
- Yes

957
01:27:14,478 --> 01:27:16,396
- You mean it?
- Yes

958
01:27:19,233 --> 01:27:22,068
Are you sure?
You really mean it?

959
01:27:24,488 --> 01:27:27,198
How happy I am!
You really mean it?

960
01:27:29,869 --> 01:27:31,578
This is so wonderful

961
01:27:31,704 --> 01:27:33,538
Thank you so much!

962
01:27:38,169 --> 01:27:42,922
Thank goodness I mentioned it,
or this would never have happened

963
01:27:45,885 --> 01:27:48,970
See? Sometimes it's good
that I talk so much

964
01:27:50,765 --> 01:27:54,351
Oh, I am so happy!

965
01:27:54,477 --> 01:27:56,603
I feel so relieved

966
01:28:01,275 --> 01:28:04,361
Noriko, let's have some
red-bean buns

967
01:28:05,321 --> 01:28:09,699
No, thank you. I ought to go now

968
01:28:09,825 --> 01:28:11,493
Why?

969
01:28:11,619 --> 01:28:15,372
Please wait a little.
Kenkichi will be home soon

970
01:28:16,374 --> 01:28:19,417
But it's already so late

971
01:28:20,252 --> 01:28:21,628
Very well

972
01:28:23,297 --> 01:28:26,174
- Can I really believe it?
- Yes

973
01:28:26,300 --> 01:28:29,094
- You promise? Are you sure?
- Yes

974
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:31,096
How happy I am!

975
01:28:33,099 --> 01:28:35,809
- Goodbye
- Goodnight

976
01:28:35,935 --> 01:28:38,103
And thank you. Thank you

977
01:28:46,862 --> 01:28:49,698
- Welcome back
- Thanks for last night

978
01:28:49,824 --> 01:28:52,784
- When's your train tomorrow?
- It's the 8:45 to Aomori

979
01:28:53,994 --> 01:28:55,662
- Well, goodnight
- Goodnight

980
01:29:01,836 --> 01:29:03,211
I'm home

981
01:29:05,965 --> 01:29:08,383
Did you see Noriko?

982
01:29:08,509 --> 01:29:10,927
Did she say anything?

983
01:29:11,053 --> 01:29:13,555
Nothing in particular

984
01:29:18,352 --> 01:29:21,771
Listen, she said
she'd join our family

985
01:29:21,897 --> 01:29:23,982
She promised she would

986
01:29:25,192 --> 01:29:28,528
You see, I told her
what's been on my mind

987
01:29:28,654 --> 01:29:32,365
It was good that I did.
I didn't think she'd accept

988
01:29:32,491 --> 01:29:34,743
- What's this about?
- She'll join our family

989
01:29:34,869 --> 01:29:37,662
- What for?
- What do you mean, "what for"?

990
01:29:37,788 --> 01:29:41,082
She's agreed to marry you,
to become your wife

991
01:29:41,208 --> 01:29:44,169
- My wife?
- Yes!

992
01:29:44,295 --> 01:29:47,922
Isn't it wonderful?
I'm so happy for you

993
01:29:51,051 --> 01:29:53,052
I'm absolutely overjoyed!

994
01:29:54,013 --> 01:29:58,683
You must be happy too.
I'm really glad for you

995
01:30:00,811 --> 01:30:04,606
- Then stop crying
- I can't help it

996
01:30:05,733 --> 01:30:08,401
If you’re happy, then show it

997
01:30:08,527 --> 01:30:12,197
You are happy, aren't you?

998
01:30:12,323 --> 01:30:18,161
- Yes, I'm happy
- Then don't hold back. Show it!

999
01:30:21,373 --> 01:30:23,291
What an odd boy you are!

1000
01:30:43,103 --> 01:30:44,687
Is Noriko back yet?

1001
01:30:45,898 --> 01:30:48,149
I heard her come in
a few minutes ago

1002
01:30:56,242 --> 01:30:57,826
- Father
- What is it?

1003
01:30:57,952 --> 01:30:59,410
- You too, Mother
- What?

1004
01:30:59,537 --> 01:31:01,204
Please come downstairs

1005
01:31:20,140 --> 01:31:22,517
- What is it?
- Please sit down

1006
01:31:31,402 --> 01:31:34,571
- Well?
- Noriko wants to marry Yabe

1007
01:31:34,697 --> 01:31:36,114
Kenkichi?

1008
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:39,784
Yes. She says she promised
his mother just now

1009
01:31:39,910 --> 01:31:43,788
But he's leaving for Akita
tomorrow morning

1010
01:31:45,249 --> 01:31:47,709
That's why I decided

1011
01:31:48,961 --> 01:31:53,214
This is important. Have you given it
careful consideration?

1012
01:31:53,340 --> 01:31:55,466
He has a child, too

1013
01:31:57,887 --> 01:32:00,680
We've all been concerned
about you getting married

1014
01:32:01,932 --> 01:32:04,183
You must've known that

1015
01:32:05,853 --> 01:32:08,813
Why didn't you at least talk
to father and mother?

1016
01:32:10,274 --> 01:32:12,525
Have you thought this through?

1017
01:32:13,694 --> 01:32:15,069
You acted rashly

1018
01:32:16,155 --> 01:32:20,074
I don't know about father and mother,
but I don't like this match

1019
01:32:21,243 --> 01:32:22,535
But I...

1020
01:32:24,288 --> 01:32:28,833
When his mother talked to me,
I didn't feel a moment's hesitation

1021
01:32:28,959 --> 01:32:32,337
I suddenly felt that
I'd be happy with him

1022
01:32:32,463 --> 01:32:34,047
That's why I accepted

1023
01:32:34,173 --> 01:32:37,926
Are you sure
you won't be sorry later?

1024
01:32:38,052 --> 01:32:39,344
I don't think so

1025
01:32:39,470 --> 01:32:42,805
Are you positive
you won't regret this later?

1026
01:32:43,891 --> 01:32:48,269
- I'm sure
- You're sure? Absolutely sure?

1027
01:32:49,396 --> 01:32:50,605
I'm sure

1028
01:32:58,072 --> 01:33:00,698
Don't you feel chilly, dear?

1029
01:33:01,533 --> 01:33:03,076
Shall we go back to bed?

1030
01:33:04,453 --> 01:33:06,162
Let's go back to sleep

1031
01:33:50,040 --> 01:33:55,336
It was thoughtless of her
to decide on her own

1032
01:34:01,176 --> 01:34:04,637
She acts like she grew up
all by herself

1033
01:34:42,885 --> 01:34:45,470
What should we do?

1034
01:34:47,389 --> 01:34:48,556
Should we let her?

1035
01:34:49,475 --> 01:34:51,976
Why not? It's her own decision

1036
01:34:53,103 --> 01:34:55,271
Maybe something can still be done

1037
01:34:56,440 --> 01:35:00,026
What could we do now?
She's made up her mind

1038
01:35:02,696 --> 01:35:05,073
You know how she is

1039
01:35:38,023 --> 01:35:39,398
Yes?

1040
01:35:42,402 --> 01:35:45,196
There's a visitor for you
in reception

1041
01:35:45,322 --> 01:35:46,739
All right

1042
01:36:01,338 --> 01:36:04,674
- Thanks for seeing him off
- I'm glad that he got a seat

1043
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:08,636
He couldn’t have stood
all the way to Akita

1044
01:36:08,762 --> 01:36:13,182
- He's lucky
- What brings you here?

1045
01:36:13,308 --> 01:36:17,562
- The station was too crowded to talk
- About what?

1046
01:36:17,688 --> 01:36:22,817
I couldn’t possibly ask you
with all those people around...

1047
01:36:23,986 --> 01:36:26,070
...but I kept thinking about it
after we parted

1048
01:36:26,196 --> 01:36:29,282
- What is this about?
- About last night

1049
01:36:30,284 --> 01:36:33,786
I still can't believe it.
It feels like it was a dream

1050
01:36:35,539 --> 01:36:37,373
Did your parents approve?

1051
01:36:38,375 --> 01:36:40,918
- Yes
- And your brother?

1052
01:36:41,044 --> 01:36:43,713
- Don't worry
- Really? They approved?

1053
01:36:48,051 --> 01:36:50,094
Wonderful, wonderful

1054
01:36:51,054 --> 01:36:54,432
But what does Kenkichi think?

1055
01:36:55,225 --> 01:36:56,934
Kenkichi?

1056
01:36:58,979 --> 01:37:04,108
He's overjoyed.
He didn't sleep a wink last night

1057
01:37:04,234 --> 01:37:06,485
We ate again
in the middle of the night

1058
01:37:07,154 --> 01:37:08,529
Really?

1059
01:37:10,115 --> 01:37:12,241
I'll live a nice long life,
thanks to you

1060
01:37:13,660 --> 01:37:15,453
I feel so relieved now

1061
01:37:17,414 --> 01:37:21,167
Well, I'll be going now.
I'm so happy!

1062
01:37:22,628 --> 01:37:25,796
- This is the way out
- Oh, is it?

1063
01:37:27,507 --> 01:37:29,550
Oh, I'm so happy!

1064
01:37:56,203 --> 01:37:58,371
Fumi, can you pull it from that end?

1065
01:38:08,298 --> 01:38:12,551
I wonder if she did the right thing,
deciding on her own

1066
01:38:13,178 --> 01:38:14,553
I wonder too

1067
01:38:15,764 --> 01:38:18,432
She didn't have to marry
someone with a child

1068
01:38:18,976 --> 01:38:20,476
You're right

1069
01:38:20,602 --> 01:38:21,978
Maybe she doesn't mind...

1070
01:38:22,813 --> 01:38:27,149
...but it's a pity there was nothing
we could do

1071
01:38:32,739 --> 01:38:34,240
I always thought...

1072
01:38:35,701 --> 01:38:38,327
...ever since she left school...

1073
01:38:38,453 --> 01:38:42,873
...every time I heard
people compliment her...

1074
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:46,294
...I wondered what kind of family
she'd marry into

1075
01:38:51,383 --> 01:38:53,718
You know Mrs Shinoda
from Denen-Chofu?

1076
01:38:53,844 --> 01:38:55,219
Yes

1077
01:38:56,179 --> 01:38:58,431
Whenever I visited
her beautiful home...

1078
01:38:58,557 --> 01:39:04,979
...I dreamed Noriko would be a wife
in such a smart house one day

1079
01:39:05,105 --> 01:39:06,772
I'm sure

1080
01:39:07,399 --> 01:39:13,070
Now I think Mr Satake's man
might've been a better choice

1081
01:39:13,196 --> 01:39:15,072
I agree

1082
01:39:15,198 --> 01:39:18,492
I don't understand
young people nowadays

1083
01:39:19,453 --> 01:39:20,536
Are you going out?

1084
01:39:21,913 --> 01:39:23,914
To buy some seed
for the canaries

1085
01:39:25,917 --> 01:39:27,668
I'll see him out

1086
01:39:34,509 --> 01:39:37,803
- Do you want me to get anything else?
- No

1087
01:39:43,268 --> 01:39:44,977
See you later

1088
01:41:19,739 --> 01:41:23,200
So you've already decided?

1089
01:41:24,870 --> 01:41:27,872
It was all very sudden.
When's your wedding?

1090
01:41:28,999 --> 01:41:32,209
We’ll discuss it when he returns
from Akita in a few months

1091
01:41:32,919 --> 01:41:34,962
You've taken a big step

1092
01:41:35,088 --> 01:41:39,049
I didn't think you were the type
who could ever leave Tokyo

1093
01:41:39,176 --> 01:41:40,384
Why?

1094
01:41:40,510 --> 01:41:45,097
I imagined you'd live Western-style,
with a flower garden...

1095
01:41:45,223 --> 01:41:46,807
...listening to Chopin

1096
01:41:46,933 --> 01:41:52,521
And in your tiled kitchen, you'd have
a refrigerator filled with Coca-Cola

1097
01:41:52,647 --> 01:41:55,524
I thought you'd be a wife
in a house like that

1098
01:41:56,443 --> 01:42:01,739
And when I'd visit, you'd meet me
on a covered porch...

1099
01:42:01,865 --> 01:42:06,035
...wearing a white sweater,
playing with a Scottish terrier...

1100
01:42:06,161 --> 01:42:09,121
...and you'd greet me over a hedge,
"Hello, how are you?"

1101
01:42:09,247 --> 01:42:13,167
- Not at all
- I couldn’t imagine otherwise

1102
01:42:14,002 --> 01:42:15,961
Akita is farm country, right?

1103
01:42:16,630 --> 01:42:20,007
- Will you wear farmer's clothes?
- Of course

1104
01:42:20,133 --> 01:42:23,385
"A wright my luvva?

1105
01:42:23,512 --> 01:42:27,473
"Proper nice weather
we been havin', eh?"

1106
01:42:28,350 --> 01:42:30,309
Can you talk like that?

1107
01:42:30,435 --> 01:42:33,229
"Reckon I can a wright. Tis easy"

1108
01:42:33,355 --> 01:42:35,773
"Well, I be!

1109
01:42:35,899 --> 01:42:40,069
"You come up 'ere from the big city
and already talk our dialect

1110
01:42:40,195 --> 01:42:42,988
"You don't look local,
but you talk local"

1111
01:42:43,114 --> 01:42:46,534
"If I's gonna live in Akita
when me man an' I tie the knot...

1112
01:42:46,660 --> 01:42:49,286
..."then reckon I shud learn
the dialect"

1113
01:42:49,412 --> 01:42:51,205
You speak it so well!

1114
01:42:51,331 --> 01:42:53,374
A girl from Akita went to our school

1115
01:42:53,500 --> 01:42:55,334
So that's why!

1116
01:43:03,093 --> 01:43:04,552
Do you remember...

1117
01:43:06,888 --> 01:43:10,015
...before your brother Shoji
left for the front...

1118
01:43:10,141 --> 01:43:12,977
...we went hiking
with him and a friend?

1119
01:43:13,103 --> 01:43:15,145
Is he the man?

1120
01:43:15,272 --> 01:43:17,731
I don't remember if he was with us

1121
01:43:17,857 --> 01:43:19,316
Did you like him then?

1122
01:43:20,986 --> 01:43:23,195
I had no particular feelings for him

1123
01:43:23,321 --> 01:43:27,074
- When did it start?
- I don't know. It happened gradually

1124
01:43:27,200 --> 01:43:29,660
Really? I had no idea

1125
01:43:29,786 --> 01:43:35,040
Of course not.
I never imagined myself marrying him

1126
01:43:35,166 --> 01:43:36,875
So what happened?

1127
01:43:38,211 --> 01:43:40,588
- It was just by accident
- Accident?

1128
01:43:40,714 --> 01:43:44,133
Well, that's not entirely true.
How can I explain it?

1129
01:43:44,259 --> 01:43:47,678
It's like when you look
for something all over the place...

1130
01:43:47,804 --> 01:43:51,599
...and then you find it was
right in front of you all along

1131
01:43:51,725 --> 01:43:55,144
My mother always looks for her glasses
when they're on her nose

1132
01:43:55,270 --> 01:43:57,021
- That's how it was
- How so?

1133
01:43:57,147 --> 01:44:00,107
He was so close at hand,
I didn't realise he was the one

1134
01:44:00,233 --> 01:44:02,067
So you did love him

1135
01:44:02,193 --> 01:44:05,487
No, it wasn't like
I was in love with him

1136
01:44:05,614 --> 01:44:09,825
I'd known him well since childhood,
and I knew I could trust him

1137
01:44:09,951 --> 01:44:11,827
That means you love him

1138
01:44:11,953 --> 01:44:16,749
No, it's different. It's the feeling
of being totally at ease with him

1139
01:44:16,875 --> 01:44:18,167
Don't you understand?

1140
01:44:18,293 --> 01:44:21,045
If that’s not being in love, what is?

1141
01:44:21,171 --> 01:44:23,130
- No, it's not
- Yes, it is

1142
01:44:23,256 --> 01:44:25,966
You've fallen in love with him

1143
01:44:26,092 --> 01:44:28,218
- You're in love
- Am I?

1144
01:44:28,345 --> 01:44:31,639
Yes, you are.
Don't make me hit you!

1145
01:44:31,765 --> 01:44:34,933
- You better not. I know how you hit
- Right!

1146
01:44:42,317 --> 01:44:45,235
- Grab her, Mother!
- What's going on here?

1147
01:44:45,362 --> 01:44:47,696
- Aya, where's that thing?
- What thing?

1148
01:44:47,822 --> 01:44:53,535
The thing I brought up the other day.
It's about this big, and yellow

1149
01:44:53,662 --> 01:44:56,246
I was sure I'd left it here
somewhere

1150
01:44:56,373 --> 01:44:58,957
- Madam, you're wanted
- Oh, all right

1151
01:45:02,295 --> 01:45:05,255
- What's she looking for?
- I don't know

1152
01:45:06,758 --> 01:45:09,385
She's always like that.
She’ll be back, anyway

1153
01:45:12,055 --> 01:45:14,723
I wonder if she’s getting senile

1154
01:45:14,849 --> 01:45:17,768
I can't leave home to get married
with her like that

1155
01:45:17,894 --> 01:45:19,812
Wouldn't your husband
live here with you?

1156
01:45:19,938 --> 01:45:23,273
No way. No real man would live
with his wife's family

1157
01:45:33,076 --> 01:45:36,453
See? And she usually
comes back once more

1158
01:45:36,579 --> 01:45:37,955
Really?

1159
01:45:39,124 --> 01:45:42,793
I'm happy for you. You're lucky
you found a man you love

1160
01:45:43,461 --> 01:45:45,921
I'm sure our new life together
won't be easy

1161
01:45:47,006 --> 01:45:52,219
There will be a lot of difficulties
and inconveniences to deal with

1162
01:45:52,345 --> 01:45:55,139
I'll have to scrimp
and work really hard

1163
01:45:55,682 --> 01:45:59,852
- And what about your boss's plan?
- I declined this morning

1164
01:45:59,978 --> 01:46:01,645
What did he say?

1165
01:46:02,647 --> 01:46:05,399
He laughed that I was old-fashioned
for a modern girl

1166
01:46:05,525 --> 01:46:08,235
That's funny. He's upstairs right now

1167
01:46:09,154 --> 01:46:11,363
And Mr Manabe's with him

1168
01:46:11,489 --> 01:46:14,616
Why not take a peek
from the next room?

1169
01:46:14,743 --> 01:46:17,911
- No
- Come on, it'll be fun

1170
01:46:18,037 --> 01:46:20,622
- He's quite good-looking
- No

1171
01:46:20,749 --> 01:46:23,667
Come on. Why not?
It'll be all right

1172
01:46:23,793 --> 01:46:27,171
No, I'd rather not.
I don't need any more husbands

1173
01:46:27,297 --> 01:46:29,339
Don't worry. Come on

1174
01:46:29,466 --> 01:46:32,718
I may marry whoever's left.
Let's go!

1175
01:46:35,388 --> 01:46:36,930
- We shouldn’t
- It's fine!

1176
01:46:37,056 --> 01:46:38,682
- Let's not
- Come on!

1177
01:47:22,477 --> 01:47:25,562
I wonder if we should give her
our blessing

1178
01:47:26,314 --> 01:47:28,023
She's impossible

1179
01:47:32,403 --> 01:47:34,446
I just don't know

1180
01:47:35,615 --> 01:47:37,741
I feel sorry for her

1181
01:47:39,744 --> 01:47:42,663
Let's talk to her again
and make sure

1182
01:47:44,415 --> 01:47:45,874
Maybe we should

1183
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:49,586
She said she's decided,
but she might have second thoughts

1184
01:47:55,510 --> 01:47:56,885
I'm back!

1185
01:48:13,987 --> 01:48:17,281
- I'm home. Sorry I'm late
- Welcome home

1186
01:48:17,407 --> 01:48:19,867
- I went to see Aya
- Did you?

1187
01:48:19,993 --> 01:48:21,535
Have you eaten?

1188
01:48:21,661 --> 01:48:24,788
I'll fix myself something.
Don't bother. I'll help myself

1189
01:48:24,914 --> 01:48:29,001
- There are some leftover croquettes
- Good. Thanks

1190
01:49:17,342 --> 01:49:18,717
Thanks for the food

1191
01:50:51,811 --> 01:50:56,523
Are you worried because
I'm marrying a man with a child?

1192
01:50:57,608 --> 01:50:59,943
- That's one reason
- Please don't be worried

1193
01:51:00,570 --> 01:51:05,198
- I'm not worried
- But mother feels sorry for you

1194
01:51:05,324 --> 01:51:08,535
I saw her crying in the kitchen
last night

1195
01:51:10,580 --> 01:51:13,331
But I love children

1196
01:51:14,375 --> 01:51:17,044
Father and mother don't see it
the same way as you do

1197
01:51:18,212 --> 01:51:23,050
Mitsuko will grow up, and what happens
when you have your own child...?

1198
01:51:23,176 --> 01:51:27,054
It’ll be fine.
I've given it a lot of thought

1199
01:51:27,180 --> 01:51:29,056
It’ll be all right

1200
01:51:29,182 --> 01:51:32,851
The situation's not that unusual.
I'm sure I can manage

1201
01:51:32,977 --> 01:51:38,356
- But...
- Don't you worry, Sister

1202
01:51:38,483 --> 01:51:43,153
- I'm confident I can do it
- Is that so? That's all right, then

1203
01:51:46,699 --> 01:51:48,992
Maybe I'm an optimist

1204
01:51:49,118 --> 01:51:52,954
Being without money doesn't worry me
like it does other people

1205
01:51:53,081 --> 01:51:54,915
I'm fine with it

1206
01:51:55,041 --> 01:51:57,667
- Are you sure?
- Yes

1207
01:51:58,878 --> 01:52:01,004
I'll stop worrying, then

1208
01:52:04,342 --> 01:52:07,094
Frankly,
I felt I couldn’t trust a man...

1209
01:52:07,220 --> 01:52:13,850
...who was still unattached
and drifting around at 40

1210
01:52:13,976 --> 01:52:17,771
I think a man with a child
is more trustworthy

1211
01:52:18,689 --> 01:52:22,526
- I admire you, Noriko
- Why?

1212
01:52:22,652 --> 01:52:26,404
I knew nothing about marriage
when I got married

1213
01:52:32,036 --> 01:52:35,997
But what will become of the family
when I leave home?

1214
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,377
You needn't worry about that

1215
01:52:40,503 --> 01:52:44,548
Your father and mother
only want you to be happy

1216
01:52:44,674 --> 01:52:46,466
So don't worry

1217
01:52:47,301 --> 01:52:51,429
But it’ll be harder for you
without me

1218
01:52:51,556 --> 01:52:55,142
It’ll be fine. You and I can compete
from now on

1219
01:52:56,185 --> 01:52:58,770
- At what?
- Economising

1220
01:52:58,896 --> 01:53:02,023
- And I don't intend to lose
- Neither do I

1221
01:53:02,150 --> 01:53:04,651
You’ll have to stop eating shortcake

1222
01:53:04,777 --> 01:53:07,445
Of course! It's too expensive

1223
01:53:07,572 --> 01:53:09,656
But if we’re given some, I'll eat it

1224
01:53:27,675 --> 01:53:31,261
Come on, it's lovely down here!

1225
01:54:23,105 --> 01:54:25,190
I'm glad you came

1226
01:54:30,988 --> 01:54:33,114
Congratulations

1227
01:54:36,535 --> 01:54:39,162
Thank you for everything
over all these years

1228
01:54:39,288 --> 01:54:42,123
No, I should thank you

1229
01:54:42,250 --> 01:54:44,918
Shall we call Aya
and go out for dinner?

1230
01:54:45,044 --> 01:54:49,673
Well, thank you for asking,
but I really must be going

1231
01:54:49,799 --> 01:54:51,883
I see

1232
01:54:52,009 --> 01:54:55,220
Well, do stop by
if you ever come up to Tokyo

1233
01:54:55,346 --> 01:54:56,972
Thank you very much

1234
01:54:57,098 --> 01:54:59,849
And take good care
of your husband

1235
01:55:05,940 --> 01:55:09,442
Manabe will probably be
disappointed, but tough luck

1236
01:55:11,570 --> 01:55:15,407
If I were younger and single and
proposed to you, would you accept?

1237
01:55:17,785 --> 01:55:19,995
You'd turn me down too?

1238
01:55:30,006 --> 01:55:32,882
Hey, come and take
a good look at Tokyo

1239
01:55:44,812 --> 01:55:46,855
Tokyo's not so bad

1240
01:56:14,216 --> 01:56:15,508
Putting it back on?

1241
01:56:15,634 --> 01:56:18,845
- I can't decide
- Leave it off

1242
01:56:31,359 --> 01:56:33,318
Please look towards me

1243
01:56:41,994 --> 01:56:43,411
Keep still, Isamu

1244
01:56:45,664 --> 01:56:48,583
Madam, chin down a little, please

1245
01:56:52,129 --> 01:56:53,588
Ready, everyone?

1246
01:56:54,590 --> 01:56:56,591
- Thank you
- Thank you

1247
01:56:57,551 --> 01:57:01,304
Could you take one more picture
of my mother and father?

1248
01:57:01,430 --> 01:57:04,140
- Good idea
- Really? All right

1249
01:57:04,266 --> 01:57:05,600
Very well

1250
01:57:27,289 --> 01:57:29,541
You look wonderful together

1251
01:57:30,584 --> 01:57:34,129
- Don't make fun of us
- It's been years since the last time

1252
01:58:09,081 --> 01:58:11,291
- I'm finished
- Me, too

1253
01:58:11,417 --> 01:58:13,209
You've eaten everything up!

1254
01:58:15,463 --> 01:58:17,213
Where are you going, Isamu?

1255
01:58:17,339 --> 01:58:18,882
To poo

1256
01:58:22,219 --> 01:58:24,179
Thanks for the meal

1257
01:58:28,934 --> 01:58:32,312
Now you're marrying Yabe,
I wish I hadn't sent him to Akita

1258
01:58:33,272 --> 01:58:37,442
But knowing he was leaving
made me realise how I felt about him

1259
01:58:37,568 --> 01:58:40,236
Three or four years will pass
in no time

1260
01:58:40,362 --> 01:58:42,906
Yes, it’ll go quickly

1261
01:58:43,908 --> 01:58:49,204
We've lived in this house
for 16 years already

1262
01:58:49,330 --> 01:58:51,664
That's right

1263
01:58:51,790 --> 01:58:55,627
It was spring
and Noriko had just left primary school

1264
01:58:55,753 --> 01:59:00,423
That's right. She was just
a little older than Minoru is now

1265
01:59:01,217 --> 01:59:04,260
She used to wear a ribbon
in her hair...

1266
01:59:04,386 --> 01:59:07,639
...and she was always singing

1267
01:59:07,765 --> 01:59:09,557
She was so cute

1268
01:59:12,228 --> 01:59:14,229
Children grow up so quickly

1269
01:59:15,356 --> 01:59:18,816
- What will you do now, Koichi?
- I'm going to start a practice here

1270
01:59:18,943 --> 01:59:21,694
- Really?
- And what about your hospital post?

1271
01:59:21,820 --> 01:59:24,864
I'll keep working there
in the evenings

1272
01:59:24,990 --> 01:59:26,491
I see...

1273
01:59:28,702 --> 01:59:34,916
Well...we're parting ways,
but we’ll be together again

1274
01:59:36,252 --> 01:59:39,796
I wish we could live
together forever...

1275
01:59:39,922 --> 01:59:41,965
...but that's impossible

1276
01:59:43,926 --> 01:59:49,389
Father and Mother, you must visit us
now and then from Yamato

1277
01:59:51,767 --> 01:59:54,143
I'm sorry, it's all my doing

1278
01:59:55,187 --> 02:00:00,233
No, it's not your fault.
It was inevitable

1279
02:00:02,403 --> 02:00:05,905
Noriko, please take
good care of your health

1280
02:00:06,031 --> 02:00:08,116
I hear Akita's very cold

1281
02:00:10,160 --> 02:00:14,622
Yes, you must take care
and keep healthy

1282
02:00:15,583 --> 02:00:19,002
Then we’ll be sure
to get together again

1283
02:02:25,963 --> 02:02:28,589
Hey, look there

1284
02:02:28,716 --> 02:02:30,633
A bride is passing by

1285
02:02:40,894 --> 02:02:43,938
I wonder what sort of family
she's marrying into

1286
02:03:01,415 --> 02:03:03,958
I wonder how Noriko is

1287
02:03:05,836 --> 02:03:08,171
Our family’s been scattered

1288
02:03:09,256 --> 02:03:12,049
But you and I,
we've done quite well

1289
02:03:15,220 --> 02:03:20,475
We've experienced a lot
in our years together

1290
02:03:22,478 --> 02:03:24,729
We shouldn’t ask for too much

1291
02:03:26,857 --> 02:03:29,567
We've been so happy

1292
02:04:46,436 --> 02:04:52,859
THE END
