<i>[Final Episode]</i>
<i>My dream is to become
a writer of children's stories.</i>

3
00:00:08,911 --> 00:00:12,180
<i>Through fun stories, where anyone
can become the cool main character,</i>

4
00:00:12,181 --> 00:00:17,461
<i>my dream is to become a writer of
children's stories who makes people happy</i>.

5
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:22,160
<i>When you're young, many people ask</i>

6
00:00:22,161 --> 00:00:24,881
<i>What is your dream?</i>

7
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:31,591
<i>However, as I mature, the number of people
asking what my dream is gradually disappearing.</i>

8
00:00:31,601 --> 00:00:37,120
<i>Holding onto my dream until I become
an adult isn't easy in this world.</i>

9
00:00:37,121 --> 00:00:41,900
<i>When faced with reality, somewhere along the line,
the fact that the dream seems way out of reach,</i>

10
00:00:41,901 --> 00:00:44,420
<i>and seems to have disappeared,</i>

11
00:00:44,421 --> 00:00:50,001
<i>causes me not to even remember what my dream
was to begin with at any given moment.</i>

12
00:00:52,851 --> 00:00:55,640
<i>However, before completely
forgetting my dream,</i>

13
00:00:55,641 --> 00:00:59,810
<i>Instead of just being envious, how
about you giving it a try too?</i>

14
00:00:59,811 --> 00:01:05,850
<i>Thankfully, someone asked the
adult version of me again.</i>

15
00:01:05,851 --> 00:01:08,570
What are we going to do
now when Hye Jin leaves?

16
00:01:08,571 --> 00:01:10,400
-I'm sad.-Isn't that so?

17
00:01:10,401 --> 00:01:14,300
Hye Jin, farewell. We'll miss you.

18
00:01:14,301 --> 00:01:16,280
Farewell, Hye Jin.

19
00:01:16,281 --> 00:01:18,140
Farewell.

20
00:01:18,141 --> 00:01:22,031
Thank you for everything
during all this time.

21
00:01:25,121 --> 00:01:27,240
-Goodbye!-Take care.

22
00:01:27,241 --> 00:01:29,581
Fighting!

23
00:01:31,511 --> 00:01:33,110
-Let's get something to eat.- I'm hungry.

24
00:01:33,111 --> 00:01:36,101
I heard the stone pot
bulgogi stew was delicious.

25
00:02:03,721 --> 00:02:06,780
<i>-Let's get married, Sung Joon.-Huh?! What?</i>

26
00:02:06,781 --> 00:02:11,671
<i>I also prepared the rings. This
one is mine. Give me your hand.</i>

27
00:02:12,991 --> 00:02:15,610
<i>This one is yours.</i>

28
00:02:15,611 --> 00:02:19,090
<i>I'm proposing to you right now,</i>

29
00:02:19,091 --> 00:02:23,190
<i>but I'm not saying let's
do it right away...</i>

30
00:02:23,191 --> 00:02:26,530
<i>You're asking me to give
you about a year, right?</i>

31
00:02:26,531 --> 00:02:30,741
<i>-I'll come often.-I'll also visit often.</i>

32
00:02:36,621 --> 00:02:39,470
<i>You have to go and be sure
to do a good job. Okay?</i>

33
00:02:39,471 --> 00:02:43,831
<i>I'll REALLY work diligently.</i>

34
00:02:47,891 --> 00:02:52,460
<i>So, I remained here and once more</i>

35
00:02:52,461 --> 00:02:54,120
<i>decided to pursue my dream.</i>

36
00:02:54,121 --> 00:02:56,020
- What? - Oh.

37
00:02:56,021 --> 00:02:59,030
- Is that it? - No.

38
00:02:59,031 --> 00:03:02,480
Hello! I've come.

39
00:03:02,481 --> 00:03:06,000
-Hye Jin!-Hye Jin! Welcome!

40
00:03:06,001 --> 00:03:08,100
Totally welcome! Welcome!

41
00:03:08,101 --> 00:03:11,931
So am I no longer the youngest?

42
00:03:16,561 --> 00:03:21,651
How can we make <i>Chadol's
Adventure</i> more fun?

43
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:28,150
Instead of having him just holding that box of wishes,
what if we made it so he could fly around on it?

44
00:03:28,151 --> 00:03:31,850
- Or rather have him just fly
around on it?-That sounds fun.

45
00:03:31,851 --> 00:03:36,080
- I think the scope of his
trip will also widen.

46
00:03:36,081 --> 00:03:40,741
It's such a good idea. If I had that
kind of box, I'd immediately fly.

47
00:03:41,671 --> 00:03:44,060
So how about we come up
with an incantation?

48
00:03:44,061 --> 00:03:45,210
Sounds great!

49
00:03:45,211 --> 00:03:48,851
What incantation should we come up with?
Ppyo-ro-rok?

50
00:03:49,501 --> 00:03:53,070
- Are you in the
workroom?<i>-It's so nice here.</i>

51
00:03:53,071 --> 00:03:58,810
All the writers are good to me and
it's so fun talking about stories.

52
00:03:58,811 --> 00:04:00,850
How are you doing? Is your
organizing going well?

53
00:04:00,851 --> 00:04:04,211
I'm in the middle of meetings with new
places while doing my organizing.

54
00:04:04,941 --> 00:04:09,830
Because of the overwhelming amount of love calls
from here and there, it's hard to handle.

55
00:04:09,831 --> 00:04:11,140
Woah!

56
00:04:11,141 --> 00:04:15,090
<i>November, 2015. Happiness depends on ourselves.
December, 2015. Success is never final.</i>

57
00:04:15,091 --> 00:04:19,461
Kim Hye Jin, I'm hungry. Come quickly!

58
00:04:20,701 --> 00:04:23,750
Sorry, sorry! I couldn't
find the sesame oil.

59
00:04:23,751 --> 00:04:27,511
-Shall we eat? - I'll eat well.

60
00:04:34,951 --> 00:04:37,880
Wow! It's bibimbap?

61
00:04:37,881 --> 00:04:40,300
<i>Looks delicious.</i>

62
00:04:40,301 --> 00:04:42,671
<i>Give me a bite too.</i>

63
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,840
<i>Ah, it's delicious!</i>

64
00:04:48,841 --> 00:04:51,410
-Seong Joon.-<i>What?</i>

65
00:04:51,411 --> 00:04:55,331
<i>I think you've become a bit crazy.</i>

66
00:04:57,301 --> 00:04:59,431
Isn't that right?

67
00:05:00,251 --> 00:05:04,090
I'm going crazy because I miss you.

68
00:05:04,091 --> 00:05:08,170
There's still 11 months left
before we can see each other?

69
00:05:08,171 --> 00:05:11,610
No way!

70
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:14,161
<i>January, 2016. Life is a
long lesson in humility.</i>

71
00:05:15,411 --> 00:05:18,521
You've been in a meeting until now?

72
00:05:19,991 --> 00:05:21,731
Yeah.

73
00:05:25,181 --> 00:05:27,170
And you? Getting ready for work?

74
00:05:27,171 --> 00:05:32,130
<i>Yeah, but because it snowed a lot, I
think there'll be a lot of traffic.</i>

75
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:35,011
Is it not snowing over there?

76
00:05:40,581 --> 00:05:42,320
Hello?!

77
00:05:42,321 --> 00:05:44,211
<i>Hye Jin?</i>

78
00:05:54,411 --> 00:05:56,401
Sleep well.

79
00:06:03,451 --> 00:06:05,920
I really miss you.

80
00:06:05,921 --> 00:06:09,381
<i>February, 2016. The language of truth is
simple. March, 2016. Love will find a way.</i>

81
00:06:09,941 --> 00:06:13,320
<i>Everyone must be working
really hard writing articles.</i>

82
00:06:13,321 --> 00:06:16,430
<i>Oh! It's such a welcome sight!</i>

83
00:06:16,431 --> 00:06:19,791
<i>-Customer number 140.-Yes.</i>

84
00:06:23,951 --> 00:06:27,500
-Hello, customer.-Hello.

85
00:06:27,501 --> 00:06:32,361
10,000 (Won); 100,000; 1,000,000;
10,000,000; 80,000,000 (Won)!

86
00:06:33,501 --> 00:06:37,501
With this amount, it'll be enough to give.

87
00:06:41,581 --> 00:06:45,100
<i>- Hye Jin.-Did you sleep?
Your voice sounds stuffy.</i>

88
00:06:45,101 --> 00:06:47,480
<i>-No-</i>

89
00:06:47,481 --> 00:06:51,790
Why are you coughing? It's a cold again,
isn't it? Did you take your medicine?

90
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:55,660
<i>It's not bad enough for me to take medicine.
It'll probably go away on its own.</i>

91
00:06:55,661 --> 00:07:01,140
It may not get better. You're still taking the subway
leaving the refrigerator empty and not eating again, right?

92
00:07:01,141 --> 00:07:04,690
If you don't feel like cooking, then at least
buy something to eat. Make sure to eat fruit.

93
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:08,000
I should be by your side
taking care of you!

94
00:07:08,001 --> 00:07:09,540
<i>Really, I said it isn't anything serious.</i>

95
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:14,081
Even if it doesn't seem like anything serious, make
sure to take your medicine and go to bed early today.

96
00:07:14,921 --> 00:07:18,021
Mmm. Talk to you soon.

97
00:07:22,101 --> 00:07:23,731
Hello?

98
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,070
Really?!

99
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:30,571
You arrived? Okay, I'll be there.

100
00:07:42,011 --> 00:07:43,930
Hye Jin, where are you going?

101
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:46,030
Someone came.

102
00:07:46,031 --> 00:07:48,651
I'll be back!

103
00:07:55,551 --> 00:07:57,841
Ha Ri!

104
00:08:16,301 --> 00:08:19,280
You surprised me!

105
00:08:19,281 --> 00:08:21,731
Ah, seriously!

106
00:08:22,781 --> 00:08:26,290
But, don't you think
you're working too hard?

107
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:29,240
Don't try to stop me. I'm going to
receive a scholarship this time.

108
00:08:29,241 --> 00:08:32,580
When did I ever try to stop you? Make
sure you receive it. Definitely!

109
00:08:32,581 --> 00:08:36,700
But how did you get here?
Class ends late today.

110
00:08:36,701 --> 00:08:39,510
I skipped class to see you.

111
00:08:39,511 --> 00:08:42,341
You did?

112
00:08:44,101 --> 00:08:45,951
One moment.

113
00:08:46,911 --> 00:08:48,950
Hey! I told you not to call.

114
00:08:48,951 --> 00:08:52,050
<i>I love you Noona.</i>-Ah, seriously.
What's with this?

115
00:08:52,051 --> 00:08:55,811
If you really call me one more
time you're seriously dead!

116
00:08:57,091 --> 00:09:00,430
Seriously, kids these days are really strange.
No matter what you say, they don't listen.

117
00:09:00,431 --> 00:09:02,480
Who is it?

118
00:09:02,481 --> 00:09:06,980
There's someone. A university student who likes
me and follows me wherever I go. A 22 year old.

119
00:09:06,981 --> 00:09:09,470
22 years old?!

120
00:09:09,471 --> 00:09:10,940
Wow!

121
00:09:10,941 --> 00:09:15,230
So there's that kind of fun when you attend
grad school. It makes school worth attending.

122
00:09:15,231 --> 00:09:18,000
Hey! Shut up. Let's go and
have something to eat.

123
00:09:18,001 --> 00:09:22,740
♪ <i>Noona, because you're my woman,
Noona, because you're my woman!</i> ♪

124
00:09:22,741 --> 00:09:27,060
Stop it.♪ <i>I'll call you "you"</i>♪

125
00:09:27,061 --> 00:09:30,150
Stop it. Stop it!♪ <i>No
matter what anyone says</i>♪

126
00:09:30,151 --> 00:09:35,151
-I told you to stop it!-Let's go!

127
00:09:36,881 --> 00:09:39,230
Aren't you getting your hair done again?

128
00:09:39,231 --> 00:09:41,500
It has totally come back.

129
00:09:41,501 --> 00:09:46,460
Ah, my hair. After being here, it
just naturally became that way.

130
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:48,330
I think I'll just leave it the way it is.

131
00:09:48,331 --> 00:09:52,790
Here, it seems to suit you better.

132
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:55,451
Don't you think so?

133
00:09:58,411 --> 00:10:03,990
But, you really seem to
like having come here.

134
00:10:03,991 --> 00:10:07,221
-Why?-Because you appear at peace.

135
00:10:08,061 --> 00:10:12,130
Seeing how it turned out, you should have
done what you wanted to since the beginning.

136
00:10:12,131 --> 00:10:15,340
If I hadn't gone over to work for The Most
team, I wouldn't have been able to come here.

137
00:10:15,341 --> 00:10:16,910
What are you talking about?

138
00:10:16,911 --> 00:10:20,370
Meeting Writer Lee was because of The Most,

139
00:10:20,371 --> 00:10:24,150
so it gave me an opportunity
to dream again.

140
00:10:24,151 --> 00:10:29,790
Where, how, and for how long I should
stay somewhere as someone who belongs,

141
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:32,681
it taught me that too.

142
00:10:34,691 --> 00:10:37,560
What?

143
00:10:37,561 --> 00:10:41,091
It's just amazing and
remarkable, that's all.

144
00:10:51,681 --> 00:10:54,320
It's true.

145
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:56,031
What is?

146
00:10:57,021 --> 00:11:00,040
<i>How could you leave so
suddenly without a word?</i>

147
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:03,070
<i>How could you do that?</i>

148
00:11:03,071 --> 00:11:08,010
<i>Why only to me... Why only to
me did you not say good bye?</i>

149
00:11:08,011 --> 00:11:11,110
<i>That's why I came here to say good bye now.</i>

150
00:11:11,111 --> 00:11:13,590
<i>Do you know how worried everyone is?</i>

151
00:11:13,591 --> 00:11:16,240
<i>Where have you been living?

156

So what does?

157
00:12:17,851 --> 00:12:19,951
It's nothing.

158

I suddenly had a thought
about that idiot reporter.

Ah. That Room ♪2024?

160

I wonder if he's well.

161
00:12:30,741 --> 00:12:35,790
Seeing how his personality is, don't you think
he'd be good at living on a desert island?

162
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:38,131
That's kind of true!

163
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:47,930
Get back home well and drive safe.

164
00:12:47,931 --> 00:12:50,651

00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:43,951
Really? Oh, it's pretty! Thank you.

305
00:24:44,581 --> 00:24:47,750
But really, it was a shock seeing
our editor-in-chief, wasn't it?

306
00:24:47,751 --> 00:24:49,250
I know.

307
00:24:49,251 --> 00:24:51,780
I'm so envious.

308
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:52,890
Envious?

309
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:55,531
Of course I'm envious.

310
00:24:57,251 --> 00:25:02,860
- What about us? You and I... later...
- Later what?

311
00:25:02,861 --> 00:25:07,030
What I'm saying is...
you and I later... b...

312
00:25:07,031 --> 00:25:08,270
Both?

313
00:25:08,271 --> 00:25:10,630
Are we getting married is what I'm asking!

314
00:25:10,631 --> 00:25:12,320
Of course we will.

315
00:25:12,321 --> 00:25:14,111
Really? When?

316
00:25:16,171 --> 00:25:17,960
- Within the year? - Within the year?

317
00:25:17,961 --> 00:25:22,960
Joon Woo, I'm so happy right now.

318
00:25:22,961 --> 00:25:25,330
I'm happier than you are.

319
00:25:25,331 --> 00:25:28,510
Joon Woo, then where should we get married?

320
00:25:28,511 --> 00:25:31,760
- Where do you want to get married?
- Somewhere cheap.

321
00:25:31,761 --> 00:25:35,981
- No— - And let's not do the photo
shoot either. That's all wasteful.

322
00:25:45,381 --> 00:25:47,620
<i>You'll soon love me too, Noona.</i> - Oh.

323
00:25:47,621 --> 00:25:50,551
Noona! I love you!

324
00:25:57,461 --> 00:25:59,441
I love you!

325
00:26:10,601 --> 00:26:12,070
Oh, you're going to your
parents' house tonight, right?

326
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:15,180
Yes. I'll come back early in the morning.

327
00:26:15,181 --> 00:26:18,340
It's an important day today.

328
00:26:18,341 --> 00:26:19,951
What kind of day?

329
00:26:20,781 --> 00:26:22,341
It's...

330
00:26:23,991 --> 00:26:26,871
the day I get to keep my
promise I made to myself.

331
00:26:29,331 --> 00:26:31,360
I'm home!

332
00:26:31,361 --> 00:26:34,460
- Why are you here? - What brings you by?

333
00:26:34,461 --> 00:26:38,400
Just because. I missed Mom and Dad.

334
00:26:38,401 --> 00:26:41,270
And I can see our pretty dongseng too!

335
00:26:41,271 --> 00:26:44,290
Take those hands off me while
I'm telling you nicely.

336
00:26:44,291 --> 00:26:46,741
Ogoo, you're so cute.

337
00:26:47,581 --> 00:26:48,640
Oh, really.

338
00:26:48,641 --> 00:26:51,280
What about dad? The print
shop was already closed.

339
00:26:51,281 --> 00:26:54,000
He wanted a good soak, so
he went to the bathhouse.

340
00:26:54,001 --> 00:26:56,050
He should be back soon.

341
00:26:56,051 --> 00:26:57,970
Oh, that was refreshing.

342
00:26:57,971 --> 00:27:01,090
He's home. Dad! I'm home!

343
00:27:01,091 --> 00:27:06,420
It's my first time at a public bathhouse.
Let's go together often, Father-in-law.

344
00:27:06,421 --> 00:27:09,230
You... What are you doing here?

345
00:27:09,231 --> 00:27:11,550
Oh! You're here?

346
00:27:11,551 --> 00:27:14,780
"Oh! You're here"?

347
00:27:14,781 --> 00:27:19,130
So the place you are staying at until
you find your own place was...

348
00:27:19,131 --> 00:27:21,331
our house?

349
00:27:24,401 --> 00:27:25,970
What are you doing to Son-in-law Ji?

350
00:27:25,971 --> 00:27:28,830
We told him not to tell you!

351
00:27:28,831 --> 00:27:31,530
Why not? How come? Huh? Exactly why?

352
00:27:31,531 --> 00:27:36,330
Because you keep nagging at my
brother-in-law. That's why!

353
00:27:36,331 --> 00:27:38,420
When did I?

354
00:27:38,421 --> 00:27:41,641
- You always did!
- You always did! - You always did!

355
00:27:44,781 --> 00:27:46,960
<i>What do you mean? You're among family!</i>

356
00:27:46,961 --> 00:27:49,820
<i>Of course, were family!</i>

357
00:27:49,821 --> 00:27:53,710
<i>What do you mean, family? Why did
you drag in someone who's busy?</i>

358
00:27:53,711 --> 00:27:58,130
<i>I'm glad you're here. Eat before you go. I'm
sure you have to eat, even if you're busy.</i>

359
00:27:58,131 --> 00:28:00,810
<i>No! He's really busy!</i>

360
00:28:00,811 --> 00:28:02,630
<i>Have some bulgogi too.</i>

361
00:28:02,631 --> 00:28:04,330
<i>Chew well.</i>

362
00:28:04,331 --> 00:28:06,900
<i>Just let him eat however he wants!</i>

363
00:28:06,901 --> 00:28:08,250
<i>Son-in-law Ji should be in
the picture too. Come here.</i>

364
00:28:08,251 --> 00:28:10,670
<i>Of course. Son-in-law Ji
has to be in the picture!</i>

365
00:28:10,671 --> 00:28:14,981
<i>Stop calling him Son-in-law Ji!</i>

366
00:28:17,511 --> 00:28:21,200
But still, you should have told me.

367
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:25,581
I tend to listen very well to the elders.

368
00:28:31,121 --> 00:28:33,911
- Thank you. - Oh, it's sweet.

369
00:28:36,471 --> 00:28:38,401
Dad, here.

370
00:28:40,731 --> 00:28:42,101
What's this?

371
00:28:43,031 --> 00:28:46,570
I really wanted to get you
a new printing machine,

372
00:28:46,571 --> 00:28:49,360
but since I left the
company, it took me longer.

373
00:28:49,361 --> 00:28:51,260
Please accept it.

374
00:28:51,261 --> 00:28:56,360
Oh no! No! When it breaks down, I
just have to fix it and use it again.

375
00:28:56,361 --> 00:29:01,300
That's right. How can we accept this?
We haven't done anything for you.

376
00:29:01,301 --> 00:29:04,310
Keep it and use it when you need.

377
00:29:04,311 --> 00:29:06,890
That's right. Use it for
when you get married.

378
00:29:06,891 --> 00:29:11,310
No, it's okay, Father and Mother. When Hye
Jin marries me, she can just bring herself.

379
00:29:11,311 --> 00:29:14,871
You don't even need a spoon. You
really can just bring yourself.

380
00:29:17,231 --> 00:29:22,280
Take it. This was my goal.

381
00:29:22,281 --> 00:29:25,450
I will only feel at ease if you accept it.

382
00:29:25,451 --> 00:29:29,431
Please accept it, Dad. Please.

383
00:29:55,171 --> 00:29:56,920
Why? Do you need something?

384
00:29:56,921 --> 00:29:58,701
No.

385
00:30:04,071 --> 00:30:06,531
You're pretty, Kim Hye Jin.

386
00:30:23,211 --> 00:30:25,770
-Let's do it together.-I'm fine!

387
00:30:25,771 --> 00:30:28,230
Let's do it together!

388
00:30:28,231 --> 00:30:30,841
Oh? What is this?

389
00:30:31,811 --> 00:30:35,700
This newlywed couple feeling?

390
00:30:35,701 --> 00:30:37,660
Hey!

391
00:30:37,661 --> 00:30:39,361

Just go to work.

00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:55,011
I can drop you off and go to work.

404
00:32:01,061 --> 00:32:02,931
What's this?

405
00:32:08,501 --> 00:32:11,710
<i>We didn't even properly
pay for your tuition,</i>

406
00:32:11,711 --> 00:32:17,040

provide you with a set of nice blankets</i>

407
00:32:17,041 --> 00:32:19,960

408
00:32:19,961 --> 00:32:25,941
<i>Now seems like the time to give this
to you. We're thankful and sorry.</i>

409
00:32:26,831 --> 00:32:29,201
<i>We love you, our daughter.</i>

410
00:32:42,891 --> 00:32:44,650
You're crying?

411
00:32:44,651 --> 00:32:48,250
Why are you crying?

412
00:32:48,251 --> 00:32:50,800
Why are you giving this to me?

413
00:32:50,801 --> 00:32:54,681
You should've gotten a new
printing machine a long time ago.

414
00:32:59,321 --> 00:33:03,471
I really like becoming
a part of your family.

415
00:33:04,911 --> 00:33:06,941
Aigoo.

416
00:33:10,181 --> 00:33:12,201
You cried?

417
00:33:23,631 --> 00:33:24,830
Good morning.

418
00:33:24,831 --> 00:33:29,371
Good morning!

419
00:33:32,311 --> 00:33:34,270
Editor in Chief! Editor in Chief!

420
00:33:34,271 --> 00:33:36,321
Editor in Chief!

421
00:33:38,411 --> 00:33:42,271
You came into the wrong room again.

422
00:33:46,291 --> 00:33:49,700
Ah, that's right. I did it again.
It's become a habit. I'm sorry.

423
00:33:49,701 --> 00:33:52,031
Deputy Editor in Chief Cha.

424
00:33:54,541 --> 00:33:56,841
Your clothes...

425
00:33:58,121 --> 00:34:01,901
This is why they keep
saying, Moron Ji, Moron Ji.

426
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,270
Omo!

427
00:34:05,271 --> 00:34:06,380
What's with this chair?

428
00:34:06,381 --> 00:34:09,130
It keeps falling out,
it'll have to be fixed.

429
00:34:09,131 --> 00:34:11,400
-Do we have a hammer?-Hammer?

430
00:34:11,401 --> 00:34:13,781
There's no hammer.

431
00:34:15,451 --> 00:34:16,900
Sunbaenim, just one moment.

432
00:34:16,901 --> 00:34:18,640
Oh, are you going to clean it for me?

433
00:34:18,641 --> 00:34:20,400
Ah, that's it, that's it.

434
00:34:20,401 --> 00:34:22,080
What are you...

435
00:34:22,081 --> 00:34:23,600
Here I go.

436
00:34:23,601 --> 00:34:26,550
Hey, be careful with that! No matter what,

437
00:34:26,551 --> 00:34:28,620
I'm... still the Chairman's son.

438
00:34:28,621 --> 00:34:30,630
<i>Hit it harder.</i>

439
00:34:30,631 --> 00:34:32,890
You really are hitting it harder.

440
00:34:32,891 --> 00:34:35,420
I used it well. -Thanks.

441
00:34:35,421 --> 00:34:40,250
But Editor, was Ten really
a part of this team?

442
00:34:40,251 --> 00:34:41,960
Of course, he was.

443
00:34:41,961 --> 00:34:43,230
What kind of person was he?

444
00:34:43,231 --> 00:34:46,431
He seemed really chic from his photos.

445
00:34:47,461 --> 00:34:49,720
That idiot is cool or whatnot.

446
00:34:49,721 --> 00:34:52,861
Isn't this the time to laugh out loud?

447
00:34:54,891 --> 00:34:58,290
But I'm really curious. What
does Shin Hyeok look like?

448
00:34:58,291 --> 00:35:01,240
I know right? I'm curious.

449
00:35:01,241 --> 00:35:06,430
He totally went into hiding. He
hasn't updated his SNS afterwards.

450
00:35:06,431 --> 00:35:09,390
That idiot is probably living somehow.

451
00:35:09,391 --> 00:35:13,911
I do kind of miss him though.
He always had this expression...

452
00:35:18,561 --> 00:35:20,530
There's a meeting in 10 minutes.

453
00:35:20,531 --> 00:35:21,671
Yes.

454
00:35:21,721 --> 00:35:23,711
Aish.

455
00:35:43,521 --> 00:35:45,021
This isn't it.

456
00:35:46,171 --> 00:35:48,180
-Are you traveling alone?-Yes.

457
00:35:48,181 --> 00:35:51,100
- Where else have you been?
- I'm just coming in from Switzerland.

458
00:35:51,101 --> 00:35:55,130
- Nice. - Just here and there
and having no fixed plans.

459
00:35:55,131 --> 00:35:56,280
Right on.

460
00:35:56,281 --> 00:35:58,490
Oh, nice beanie by the way.

461
00:35:58,491 --> 00:36:01,281
Thank you. I got it from my friend.

462
00:36:03,531 --> 00:36:05,920
<i>What do you think? Is it pretty?</i>

463
00:36:05,921 --> 00:36:08,201
<i>Yes well, it's pretty.
It looks like a thimble.</i>

464
00:36:08,961 --> 00:36:10,070
<i>How much is it?</i>

465
00:36:10,071 --> 00:36:12,460
<i>-10,000 Won.-He said it costs 10,000 Won.</i>

466
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:14,890
<i>- Pardon?-Jackson, you're buying
this for me. Didn't you know?</i>

467
00:36:14,891 --> 00:36:16,560
<i>Thank you. I'll use it
for a long, long time.</i>

468
00:36:16,561 --> 00:36:17,431
<i>Goodbye.</i>

469
00:36:17,432 --> 00:36:18,861
<i>What...</i>

470
00:36:23,651 --> 00:36:27,031
Wait, aren't you Ten?

471
00:36:27,841 --> 00:36:29,110
Yes, I am.

472
00:36:29,111 --> 00:36:31,060
Really? Can I have your
autograph or photograph?

473
00:36:31,061 --> 00:36:33,280
I'm kidding. I'm not.

474
00:36:33,281 --> 00:36:34,650
I wish I was.

475
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:35,890
Dude, that's not funny man.

476
00:36:35,891 --> 00:36:37,731
Hey.

477
00:36:42,661 --> 00:36:45,741
It works 100% of the time.

478
00:36:48,171 --> 00:36:51,321
Where should I travel to next?

479
00:36:58,221 --> 00:37:00,090
Writer Kim?

480
00:37:00,091 --> 00:37:01,981
Writer Kim!

481
00:37:02,891 --> 00:37:05,740
Write Kim Hye Jin!

482
00:37:05,741 --> 00:37:07,630
Oh! Hello.

483
00:37:07,631 --> 00:37:10,130
- I called your name.
Didn't you hear?-Pardon?

484
00:37:10,131 --> 00:37:13,530
I didn't know you called my name.

485
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:16,070
I saw the illustrations and
thought we should have a meeting.

486
00:37:16,071 --> 00:37:19,580
Would you like to come to my workroom
with the writers and writing team?

487
00:37:19,581 --> 00:37:21,590
Yes. I'll go and ask.

488
00:37:21,591 --> 00:37:23,760
Okay. See you later, Writer Kim.

489
00:37:23,761 --> 00:37:25,991
Yes, goodbye.

490
00:37:28,191 --> 00:37:30,851
Writer Kim?

491
00:37:38,491 --> 00:37:41,210
-Number 180, Miss Min Ha Ri?-Yes.

492
00:37:41,211 --> 00:37:45,071
You're older but don't have any
particular work experience.

493
00:37:46,341 --> 00:37:47,490
Yes.

494
00:37:47,491 --> 00:37:51,260
By any chance, didn't you
work at the Ara Hotel?

495
00:37:51,261 --> 00:37:52,091
Pardon?

496
00:37:52,092 --> 00:37:56,080
I was at the Ara Hotel until last year.

497
00:37:56,081 --> 00:37:59,911
I'm certain that I saw you at the hotel.
Aren't I correct?

498
00:38:02,061 --> 00:38:04,460
Yes, you're right.

499
00:38:04,461 --> 00:38:07,510
But, why didn't you write
down your work experience?

500
00:38:07,511 --> 00:38:10,961
Because it wasn't a position that
I earned with my own abilities.

501
00:38:11,721 --> 00:38:14,421
It finally came out!

502
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:16,800
Wow!

503
00:38:16,801 --> 00:38:19,600
Wow! We really worked hard.

504
00:38:19,601 --> 00:38:21,820
Everyone really worked hard for a year.

505
00:38:21,821 --> 00:38:24,000
You've worked hard.

506
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:26,061
Hye Jin!

507
00:38:28,591 --> 00:38:31,230
You worked hard.

508
00:38:31,231 --> 00:38:33,530
Look at the color. Isn't it fantastic?

509
00:38:33,531 --> 00:38:37,120
I think it came out really
well.<i>The Peeper Story</i>

510
00:38:37,121 --> 00:38:39,670
Oh, now for several days,
I'm just going to...

511
00:38:39,671 --> 00:38:42,780
<i>Oh! There was a person in this corner.</i>

512
00:38:42,781 --> 00:38:44,780
<i>You found it.</i>

513
00:38:44,781 --> 00:38:47,660
<i>That's the peeking girl</i>

514
00:38:47,661 --> 00:38:49,470
<i>Peeking girl?</i>

515
00:38:49,471 --> 00:38:52,070
<i>Ah! She's really peeking!</i>

516
00:38:52,071 --> 00:38:55,490
<i>But the peeking girl is just
like a hidden picture game.</i>"

517
00:38:55,491 --> 00:38:58,380
<i>Hidden picture game?</i>

518
00:38:58,381 --> 00:39:01,490
<i>Look. If you look carefully, you
don't even know she's there.</i>

519
00:39:01,491 --> 00:39:03,730
<i>Just like a hidden picture game.</i>

520
00:39:03,731 --> 00:39:07,721
<i>That's right. It's just
like a hidden picture game.</i>

524
00:39:35,321 --> 00:39:39,491
Did you decide as a group to concentrate solely on
the color white when you made up this proposal?

525
00:39:46,821 --> 00:39:50,931
Pretend these plans never existed, start
from scratch, and plan another meeting.

526
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:54,841
Everyone, let's do things properly.

527
00:39:59,391 --> 00:40:02,001
I knew it ever since he wanted
us to do a big clean up.

528
00:40:02,791 --> 00:40:07,371
Excuse me, Editor-in-Chief.
That's not your office.

529
00:40:10,891 --> 00:40:14,050
Do you want me to switch
the rooms around for you?

530
00:40:14,051 --> 00:40:16,011
No, it's okay.

531
00:40:18,191 --> 00:40:20,740
He can't even find his own room.

532
00:40:20,741 --> 00:40:23,381
Ah, please take one of these.

533
00:40:24,191 --> 00:40:26,770
- Why?- What is it?

534
00:40:26,771 --> 00:40:29,791
Put it right on top of here.

535
00:40:32,791 --> 00:40:34,610
Here you go.

536
00:40:34,611 --> 00:40:36,331
I...

537
00:40:37,881 --> 00:40:39,800
- I'm getting married.- What?!

538
00:40:39,801 --> 00:40:41,350
- Omo? - You're getting married overnight?

539
00:40:41,351 --> 00:40:42,550
Getting married?

540
00:40:42,551 --> 00:40:46,571
If you have time I hope you
can come to at least eat.

541
00:40:50,491 --> 00:40:54,131
- This...- Hye-Hye-Hye-Hye...

542
00:40:55,191 --> 00:40:57,560
Ja-Jackson? Isn't it Jackson?

543
00:40:57,561 --> 00:41:00,070
- Oh! - That..that's... our Hye Jin?

544
00:41:00,071 --> 00:41:04,550
So..our... no..it's Hye Jin right?

545
00:41:04,551 --> 00:41:06,490
When did those two get together?

546
00:41:06,491 --> 00:41:07,560
- How? - Oh my God!

547
00:41:07,561 --> 00:41:10,770
Our Hye Jin was... our Sin Hyeok...

548
00:41:10,771 --> 00:41:13,140
Omo, omo.

549
00:41:13,141 --> 00:41:18,141
They should have made the invitation
a bit better. More Most-like.

550
00:41:22,191 --> 00:41:25,150
Wifey! Come out. There's
somewhere we need to go.

551
00:41:25,151 --> 00:41:26,850
Where are we going all of a sudden?

552
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:32,840
For the last time, let's go somewhere
with a great view and have fun.

553
00:41:32,841 --> 00:41:33,910
The last time?

554
00:41:33,911 --> 00:41:38,991
<i>You're getting married tomorrow.</i> I
want to congratulate you properly.

555
00:41:43,391 --> 00:41:46,080
Congrats on your marriage, Wifey!

556
00:41:46,081 --> 00:41:51,970
Ah, if I call you 'Wife' now,
won't a certain someone get mad?

557
00:41:51,971 --> 00:41:57,360
I put lots of effort into it with
hope that you will live well.

558
00:41:57,361 --> 00:42:01,080
Thank you Ha Ri. You're the best.

559
00:42:01,081 --> 00:42:04,770
I still have one more thing
to congratulate you.

560
00:42:04,771 --> 00:42:06,591
What?

561
00:42:10,491 --> 00:42:12,171
<i>Employment Notice Miss Min Ha Ri. Congratulations
on your employment with Q Hotel.</i>

563
00:42:18,291 --> 00:42:22,250
Congrats, Ha Ri! It turned out well!

564
00:42:22,251 --> 00:42:25,270
Cheers! Yay!

565
00:42:25,271 --> 00:42:27,420
To a happy married life for Kim Hye Jin,

566
00:42:27,421 --> 00:42:30,200
and to the bright future
of hotelier Min Ha Ri!

567
00:42:30,201 --> 00:42:33,811
- Cheers! - Cheers! One shot!

568
00:42:35,291 --> 00:42:39,161
Oh, how pretty.

569
00:42:41,991 --> 00:42:45,141
But, why isn't she coming
out of the bathroom?

570
00:42:49,691 --> 00:42:51,400
- Ta-da!- What is this?

571
00:42:51,401 --> 00:42:55,391
Not yet, not yet. Ta-da!

572
00:42:58,091 --> 00:43:03,500
I wanted to give you a bouquet of flower
that I made myself when you get married.

573
00:43:03,501 --> 00:43:08,981
You know that even took classes to make
these and worked very hard to prepare them.

574
00:43:09,891 --> 00:43:12,910
There's a little uneven,

575
00:43:12,911 --> 00:43:17,420
but I wanted to make it
myself and give it to you.

576
00:43:17,421 --> 00:43:21,381
Ha Ri. How did you...?

577
00:43:22,191 --> 00:43:24,341
Thank you.

578
00:43:25,891 --> 00:43:30,120
For today, tears are not allowed.

579
00:43:30,121 --> 00:43:33,150
Today, I'm definitely not going to cry!

580
00:43:33,151 --> 00:43:36,771
Okay. I'm not gonna cry.

581
00:43:42,791 --> 00:43:47,510
You have to go and live a good life.

582
00:43:47,511 --> 00:43:53,191
You really have to live
really really happily, okay?

583
00:43:53,991 --> 00:43:58,601
Okay. I'll live really well.

584
00:44:04,491 --> 00:44:09,030
Even when you're married, you have to
come running to me when I'm crying.

585
00:44:09,031 --> 00:44:11,341
You know, right?

586
00:44:17,091 --> 00:44:19,931
My Hye Jin is so pretty.

587
00:44:21,491 --> 00:44:23,940
Now, now, now. I'm taking it.

588
00:44:23,941 --> 00:44:27,800
One, two, three.

589
00:44:27,801 --> 00:44:29,090
One more, one more!

590
00:44:29,091 --> 00:44:32,090
One, two, three.

591
00:44:32,091 --> 00:44:33,880
Ha Ri, hurry, come here.
Let's take one together.

592
00:44:33,881 --> 00:44:34,841
Hold on.

593
00:44:34,842 --> 00:44:37,971
- Ah, hurry!- I'm coming!

594
00:44:38,891 --> 00:44:42,360
- One, two, three.- One, two, three.

595
00:44:42,361 --> 00:44:45,561
- One, two, three.- One, two, three.

596
00:44:56,691 --> 00:44:59,131
I'm so nervous.

597
00:45:06,991 --> 00:45:09,021
Shall we go?

598
00:46:00,291 --> 00:46:02,860
Hye Jin, where are the nail clippers?

599
00:46:02,861 --> 00:46:07,961
Look in the second drawer.

600
00:46:15,591 --> 00:46:19,300
Oh yes. This is Writer Kim Hye Jin
from the story compilation group.

601
00:46:19,301 --> 00:46:23,990
Yes. We haven't been able to look it over because
Writer Choi hasn't sent me the illustrations.

602
00:46:23,991 --> 00:46:26,821
Ah, yes. I understand.

603
00:46:27,591 --> 00:46:29,740
It's not there.

604
00:46:29,741 --> 00:46:32,351
- Did you look carefully?- Yeah.

605
00:46:33,191 --> 00:46:34,220
It's not there.

606
00:46:34,221 --> 00:46:35,860
It should be there.

607
00:46:35,861 --> 00:46:39,630
I said it's not there. When I find
it, cut my nails for me, Sweetie.

608
00:46:39,631 --> 00:46:41,841
Okay.

609
00:47:07,591 --> 00:47:09,551
Kiss.

610
00:47:16,491 --> 00:47:18,650
What do you think you're doing right now?

611
00:47:18,651 --> 00:47:23,020
Ah Hye Jin changed. Weren't
you a kissing maniac?

612
00:47:23,021 --> 00:47:26,931
Today is the deadline. I will
give you tons of kisses later.

613
00:47:28,291 --> 00:47:31,960
We got married but I'm lonely.

614
00:47:31,961 --> 00:47:35,940
I'm soooo lonely!

615
00:47:35,941 --> 00:47:40,771
So, very, extremely lonely!

616
00:47:41,991 --> 00:47:46,811
I closed my laptop.

617
00:47:56,491 --> 00:48:00,991
Hey, where are we going? Hey!

00:48:02,091 --> 00:48:08,411
The wheel on the trunk has broken and needs
to get fixed. Where can I get it done?

619
00:48:09,591 --> 00:48:12,010
You're in Room ♪701, right?

620
00:48:12,011 --> 00:48:13,130
Yes I am.

621
00:48:13,131 --> 00:48:17,660
I thought so. I saw your suitcase
was broken so I already fixed it.

622
00:48:17,661 --> 00:48:19,250
Oh, really?

623
00:48:19,251 --> 00:48:22,990
Aiyoo, thank you. Thank you so much.

624

No, don't worry about it.

625
