How can you manage to be
looking at this right now?

12
00:03:35,622 --> 00:03:37,671
This is the critical time

When do we have until?

16
00:03:47,771 --> 00:03:49,317
The end of this month, at most.

17
00:03:49,317 --> 00:03:51,303
I'm planning to wrap things up here
by the time the kids have vacation

18
00:03:51,303 --> 00:03:53,967
and move over to
the Pacific Seasonal Migration Project.

19
00:04:00,664 --> 00:04:02,150
Have you seen this?

20
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,818
A GPS tracker?

21
00:04:04,818 --> 00:04:06,936
It sends the GPS coordinates
once every four hours

22
00:04:06,936 --> 00:04:08,360
and you can check it on an app.

23
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,556
And it's accurate within
a 40 meter radius.

24
00:04:12,717 --> 00:04:14,299
That's crazy.

25
00:04:14,776 --> 00:04:17,452
By the way,
what are you going to do?

26
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:21,735
I recovered 9 of the 120 rings.

27
00:04:21,735 --> 00:04:23,462
I'm planning to pack my things
when I collect 20.

How will you manage
when we stop getting paid?

29
00:04:26,149 --> 00:04:29,198

How do birds fly?

32
00:04:55,945 --> 00:04:58,705
I'm going to draw
the shape of a bird's wing.

33
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,448
If you were to cut a bird's wing

34
00:05:04,448 --> 00:05:08,960
the cross-section
would look like this.

35
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,729
Teacher!

36
00:05:10,729 --> 00:05:12,931
What's a cross-section?

37
00:05:12,931 --> 00:05:16,816
- Cross-section?
- What's a cross-section?

38
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,685
A cross-section is...

39
00:05:34,262 --> 00:05:37,602
I thought you were going to use me
as only a science teacher.

40
00:05:37,602 --> 00:05:39,493
Yes, that was originally our plan.

41
00:05:39,493 --> 00:05:44,393
But the teacher of Class 3 said
that she's quitting immediately.

42
00:05:44,393 --> 00:05:49,590
She got pregnant with twins,
and I think her babies will be born soon.

43
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:51,222
And the kids will have
their vacation soon

44
00:05:51,222 --> 00:05:53,455
so it'll be hard to hire
a new teacher.

45
00:05:53,455 --> 00:05:57,073
So please be that class's homeroom
teacher for just three weeks, Ms. Kang.

46
00:05:57,073 --> 00:06:00,274
And please help her out
a little, Ms. Song.

47
00:06:00,274 --> 00:06:02,260
Don't worry about planning lessons.

48
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,315
I've written all of them

49
00:06:03,315 --> 00:06:06,816
so all you need to do is go to
the classroom and follow them.

50
00:06:12,561 --> 00:06:15,816
Oh Cheol died yesterday morning.

51
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:18,638
Who died?

52
00:06:19,099 --> 00:06:22,700
Oh Cheol. It was a duck that
the kids in Class 3 were raising.

53
00:06:23,613 --> 00:06:26,084
I'm sure that the kids
will be quite sad.

54
00:06:26,084 --> 00:06:30,587
Ah, have the kids write a letter to
Oh Cheol during fifth period.

<i>[Lesson Plan]</i>

Write a letter to a dead duck?

57
00:06:37,209 --> 00:06:41,174
As you know,
children also feel pain from loss.

58
00:06:41,174 --> 00:06:45,606
So we have to give them
a chance to express that.

<i>[A Letter to Oh Cheol in Heaven]</i>

60
00:07:14,524 --> 00:07:16,310
Hye Na.

61
00:07:17,436 --> 00:07:18,907
Are you not going to write one?

62
00:07:18,907 --> 00:07:22,219
Dead things can't read letters, Teacher.

63
00:07:22,806 --> 00:07:26,602
To be honest, there's no such
thing as Heaven, either.

64
00:07:28,054 --> 00:07:31,914
I feel so sorry for Oh Cheol!

65
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:34,412
Teacher.

66
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:37,173
Ducks can't read, anyway.

67
00:07:37,173 --> 00:07:38,613
- Yeah, you're right!
- Yeah, you're right!

68
00:07:38,613 --> 00:07:42,126
Hi, Duck. You can't poop anymore
since you're dead, huh?

69
00:07:46,719 --> 00:07:49,111
Be quiet, kids!

70
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,868
When you're dead,
you can't breathe

71
00:07:58,868 --> 00:08:01,558
and you can't eat.

72
00:08:01,558 --> 00:08:02,876
That's right.

73
00:08:03,452 --> 00:08:04,818
And you don't poop, either.

74
00:08:05,895 --> 00:08:07,907
So I'm sure he can't
read a letter, either.

75
00:08:08,469 --> 00:08:12,380
But Oh Cheol is a duck that you guys
were raising since he was young.

76
00:08:12,911 --> 00:08:15,298
So to have a duck
like that die...

77
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,512
would probably make you all sad.

78
00:08:18,512 --> 00:08:20,693
And I'm sure you miss him, too.

79
00:08:20,693 --> 00:08:23,075
Write stuff like that in your letters.

80
00:08:23,746 --> 00:08:26,431
So if you write a letter like that

81
00:08:26,431 --> 00:08:31,380
you will feel a bit less sadness
and pain than before.

82
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:35,339
You don't have to write
a letter if you don't want to.

83
00:08:36,255 --> 00:08:39,154
Since Oh Cheol can't
read your letter anyway.

84
00:08:43,995 --> 00:08:45,479

<i>ducks die if they eat chocolate
and cooking flour</i>

94
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:28,667
<i>so they fed the duck chocolate

It's only three weeks, so do your best.

96
00:09:34,901 --> 00:09:38,118
Looks like you'll end up learning
a lot about young primates.

97
00:09:39,104 --> 00:09:41,858
I applied to programs in
China, Iceland, and Canada.

98
00:09:41,858 --> 00:09:45,656
The Skomer Center in Iceland is quite
interested in researching murres.

99
00:09:45,656 --> 00:09:47,090
How many rings did you retrieve?

100
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,310
12.

101
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:50,982
So you have eight left, then.

102
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:57,867
Leaving quickly,
and coming back quickly.

103
00:09:57,867 --> 00:09:59,537
You're just like a migratory bird.

104
00:09:59,537 --> 00:10:01,546
I'm thinking about
not coming back this time.

105
00:10:01,546 --> 00:10:02,772
Don't you have any interest

106
00:10:02,772 --> 00:10:04,934
in participating in society,
like other people?

107
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:09,470
Don't you want to stay in one place,
find a mate, and maybe have kids?

108
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:12,941
10 percent of all groups of animals
are loners, you know.

109
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,162
What did they say?

110
00:10:22,162 --> 00:10:24,142
Look for Soo Jin.

111
00:10:24,142 --> 00:10:26,295
Is it... cancer?

112
00:10:26,295 --> 00:10:27,817
Go find Soo Jin.

113
00:10:27,817 --> 00:10:29,862
It's been over 10 years since we
were last in touch with her

114
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:31,782
so how could I suddenly
go and find her now?

115
00:10:31,782 --> 00:10:33,903
First, tell me what they said...

116
00:10:34,974 --> 00:10:39,017
I want my daughter, Soo Jin,
to be the first person I tell.

117
00:10:42,368 --> 00:10:46,177
"The elephant and crocodile tried to

00:10:46,177 --> 00:10:50,724
"Then, the lion said,
'Let's all share a little.'"

119
00:10:50,724 --> 00:10:53,945
"'I think the giraffe is acting that
way because it's hungry'"

120
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:57,935
"'and I think the monkey got mad
because it was woken up from its sleep.'"

121
00:10:57,935 --> 00:11:02,781
"The elephant saw the giraffe and monkey
make amends, and said"

122
00:11:02,781 --> 00:11:05,379
"'Wow, Lion! You really are amazing!'"

Teacher.

126
00:11:29,906 --> 00:11:35,055
I don't want to eat next to Hye Na.

127
00:11:35,849 --> 00:11:36,926
Why?

<i>Do you know what my job is?</i>

A... bird researcher?

131
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:58,203
I know a ton about birds.

132
00:11:58,798 --> 00:12:01,743
But you know, the way that Oh Cheol
died this time was quite suspicious.

133
00:12:01,743 --> 00:12:03,766
Ducks really don't die
that easily, you see.

134
00:12:03,766 --> 00:12:06,686
But when I started observing Oh Cheol

135
00:12:06,686 --> 00:12:09,973
I noticed that he suddenly started eating
a lot less, and vomited strange things.

136
00:12:10,776 --> 00:12:12,565
Maybe...

137
00:12:13,423 --> 00:12:16,720
someone fed him something
that he shouldn't have been fed?

138
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,580
For example, chocolate...
or cooking flour.

139
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,869
It wasn't cooking flour.

140
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:25,743
It was candy sugar.

141
00:12:25,743 --> 00:12:27,689
There is a way for me to check.

142
00:12:28,976 --> 00:12:31,886
I can go get
Oh Cheol's carcass

143
00:12:31,886 --> 00:12:34,618
and open up his stomach with a knife

144
00:12:34,618 --> 00:12:37,027
and check what's inside.

145
00:12:37,027 --> 00:12:38,644
And I can use the CCTV camera footage

146
00:12:38,644 --> 00:12:41,744
to find out who fed Oh Cheol
what kinds of things, too.

147
00:12:42,465 --> 00:12:43,599
Should I do it, or not?

148
00:12:43,599 --> 00:12:44,798
Don't!

00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:46,894
Don't, Ms. Kang.

00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:46,959
There are two consonants
at the end of this syllable cluster.

161
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,276
It's difficult, isn't it?

162
00:13:48,301 --> 00:13:51,796
There aren't a lot of kids in my class
who know how to read all the words

163
00:13:51,796 --> 00:13:54,450
with two consonants at
the end of a syllable cluster.

164
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,614
Were you surprised, Ms. Kang?

165
00:14:18,354 --> 00:14:20,598
Why are you walking around alone
at this time of night?

166
00:14:20,598 --> 00:14:24,046
I've always walked around alone,
ever since I was five years old.

167
00:14:24,046 --> 00:14:25,061
What about your mom?

168
00:14:25,061 --> 00:14:26,436
She's not home yet.

169
00:14:35,987 --> 00:14:38,072
Would you like a bite?

170
00:14:38,792 --> 00:14:40,686
I don't eat red bean buns.

171
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,118
It tastes good, though.

172
00:14:54,421 --> 00:14:55,859
Want me to give you a bite?

173
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:10,835
It really does taste like an
Italian pizza-making master made it!

174
00:15:11,388 --> 00:15:13,594
You know what I'm talking about,
right? Napoli pizza!

175
00:15:16,234 --> 00:15:17,394
You smiled.

176
00:15:18,031 --> 00:15:20,453
It's the first time I've ever
seen you smile, Ms. Kang.

177
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,749
What's that?

178
00:15:29,749 --> 00:15:31,104
A notebook filled with
my favorite things.

179
00:15:31,104 --> 00:15:33,503
If I write down the things
that I like, like this

180
00:15:33,503 --> 00:15:37,195
I won't forget them, and I can take
it out to read them when I need to.

181
00:15:38,614 --> 00:15:41,682
Um... kind of like a refrigerator.

182
00:15:41,682 --> 00:15:43,368
And what do you have written in there?

183
00:15:49,845 --> 00:15:52,233
A curving, sloped road.

184
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:56,061
<i>Big bags with wheels on them.</i>

185
00:15:56,061 --> 00:15:59,170
<i>When balloons get bigger and bigger.</i>

186
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:01,506
<i>A key, and a lock.</i>

187
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:04,771
<i>[Cafe Latte]</i>

188
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,469
Cafe lattes.

189
00:16:09,681 --> 00:16:10,782
What?

190
00:16:10,782 --> 00:16:13,461
Cafe lattes.
I really like them.

191
00:16:17,814 --> 00:16:20,113
Young children shouldn't drink coffee.

192
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:21,281
I'm fine, though.

193
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:23,708
If young kids drink coffee

194
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:26,027
they won't be able to sleep well.

195
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:27,585
And it's not good for their brains.

196
00:16:27,585 --> 00:16:29,138
You won't get taller, either.

197
00:16:29,138 --> 00:16:30,623
Really?

198
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,979
What kinds of things
do you like, Ms. Kang?

199
00:16:40,002 --> 00:16:42,075
Eating a meal...

200
00:16:42,772 --> 00:16:45,050
quietly, by myself.

201
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,399
Kim Hye Na.

202
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,591
Listen carefully to what
I'm about to tell you.

203
00:17:08,465 --> 00:17:10,930
Cut your nails once a week.

204
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:13,176
And wash your hair at least
once every three days.

205
00:17:13,176 --> 00:17:15,257
Be sure to wipe your mouth
after you eat anything.

206
00:17:16,743 --> 00:17:19,337
Change your socks and
underwear once a day.

207
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:22,404
And if you don't have
a lot of clothes, alternate outfits.

208
00:17:22,404 --> 00:17:24,784
A dirty child will be attacked.

209
00:17:24,784 --> 00:17:27,361
Because it's a sign that there's
nobody taking care of them.

210
00:17:27,361 --> 00:17:30,862
So you might as well have a sign on you
that says you're easy prey.

211
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:34,945
What do you think you need to do
if nobody is looking after you?

212
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,647
You have to take care of yourself.

213
00:17:39,647 --> 00:17:41,712
Many children do this.

214
00:17:42,064 --> 00:17:44,278
So I'm sure that you will be
able to do this, too.

215
00:17:51,334 --> 00:17:56,299
Did you know how to cut your nails
when you were eight years old, too?

216
00:18:17,901 --> 00:18:19,253
You evil wench!

217
00:18:19,253 --> 00:18:20,884
You were so wicked to your mother

218
00:18:20,884 --> 00:18:23,116
so how dare you covet
someone else's child? Huh?

219
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:29,384
You deserve to live alone forever
without ever having your own kids.

220
00:18:30,523 --> 00:18:33,551
She's my teacher, Granny.

221
00:18:33,551 --> 00:18:36,070
And I really like her.

222
00:19:44,795 --> 00:19:48,780
<i>- Hey!
- Stop it, that hurts!</i>

223
00:19:54,028 --> 00:19:55,720
Where's Hye Na?

224
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,874
She's sleeping in the bathroom!

225
00:19:57,874 --> 00:20:01,550
Hey, it's not like
the bathroom is the classroom!

226
00:20:04,335 --> 00:20:06,742
<i>[Nurse's Office]</i>

227
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:11,993
The nurse says that
she thinks she's malnourished.

228
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:14,249
And...

229
00:20:14,249 --> 00:20:16,368
she has scars all over her body.

230
00:20:16,968 --> 00:20:20,211
I worry a lot for children who
are raised by single parents as is...

231
00:20:21,242 --> 00:20:22,866
but she's such a strange child.

232
00:20:22,866 --> 00:20:25,246
She doesn't cry
no matter what happens to her.

233
00:20:25,246 --> 00:20:28,507
Didn't you notice anything off about her?

234
00:20:44,095 --> 00:20:45,709
Hye Na.

235
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:51,268
Did Ms. Ye Eun leave?

236
00:20:52,698 --> 00:20:53,788
Yeah.

237
00:20:59,442 --> 00:21:01,816
That teacher is weird.

238
00:21:01,816 --> 00:21:03,086
Why?

239
00:21:03,086 --> 00:21:05,647
I told her that I tripped down the stairs

240
00:21:05,647 --> 00:21:07,602
and she took a photo of me.

241
00:21:07,602 --> 00:21:09,691
Where? Which part of you
did she take a photo of...

242
00:21:11,106 --> 00:21:13,145
Do you...

243
00:21:13,145 --> 00:21:16,137
enjoy seeing other people's scars, too?

244
00:21:25,518 --> 00:21:27,966
I tripped down the stairs, too.

245
00:21:29,807 --> 00:21:31,716
Did it hurt?

246
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:35,452
Did it hurt?

247
00:21:35,452 --> 00:21:37,432
Did you cry?

248
00:21:39,915 --> 00:21:41,105
A little.

249
00:21:43,191 --> 00:21:45,479
I didn't cry.

250
00:21:46,489 --> 00:21:50,208
At times like that, you should
think of something you like.

251
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:53,173
Then you might stop crying
even when you're crying.

252
00:21:54,823 --> 00:21:56,819
I see.

253
00:21:56,819 --> 00:22:00,454
But you know,
Ms. Ye Eun really is weird.

254
00:22:01,423 --> 00:22:04,834
She keeps asking me if I like my mom.

255
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:07,345
So, what did you say?

256
00:22:08,501 --> 00:22:12,899
I told her that I like her
quite a lot, of course.

257
00:22:17,622 --> 00:22:19,058
I see.

258
00:22:19,507 --> 00:22:21,318
Are you relieved?

259
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,231
What did I tell you last time
about what I do to noisy kids?

260
00:23:16,047 --> 00:23:18,933
But, Uncle.

261
00:23:18,933 --> 00:23:22,982
We... live on the first floor.

262
00:23:30,769 --> 00:23:32,213
Is anyone home?

263
00:23:34,471 --> 00:23:36,108
Are you home, Hye Na?

264
00:23:41,733 --> 00:23:43,488
Oh, Hye Na!

265
00:23:44,781 --> 00:23:46,407
Hello.

266
00:23:46,407 --> 00:23:49,077
I'm Song Ye Eun, a teacher
from Hye Na's school.

267
00:23:49,077 --> 00:23:51,905
Hye Na didn't come to
school today, so...

268
00:23:51,905 --> 00:23:54,348
I called the school
and told them that she has a cold.

269
00:23:54,348 --> 00:23:56,712
Um, but...

270
00:23:57,681 --> 00:24:00,154
Hye Na, what happened to your ear?

271
00:24:00,154 --> 00:24:03,172
Oh, I'm sorry. Did it hurt?

272
00:24:03,172 --> 00:24:05,576
Um, let me see, Hye Na.

273
00:24:07,399 --> 00:24:09,006
Show her, Hye Na.

274
00:24:09,006 --> 00:24:11,172
And tell her how you got hurt.

275
00:24:12,963 --> 00:24:15,060
I got hit by a baseball.

276
00:24:16,057 --> 00:24:18,352
On the street, right here.

277
00:24:18,945 --> 00:24:21,012
Oh, you poor thing!

278
00:24:21,012 --> 00:24:22,924
They said that she almost
burst her eardrum.

279
00:24:22,924 --> 00:24:24,049
I don't know why they were

280
00:24:24,049 --> 00:24:25,818
playing baseball on the street
instead of at a field.

281
00:24:27,373 --> 00:24:28,646
Um...

282
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:33,005
Hye Na has other injuries
all over her body, too.

283
00:24:33,005 --> 00:24:34,332
I know.

284
00:24:36,161 --> 00:24:37,823
Did you...

285
00:24:37,823 --> 00:24:40,375
come here to ask if I was the
one who did it, by any chance?

286
00:24:41,515 --> 00:24:42,895
Ms. Song.

287
00:24:42,895 --> 00:24:45,663
I just keep tripping a lot.

288
00:24:45,663 --> 00:24:50,767
The doctor said some kids trip a lot
because they have bad hearing.

289
00:24:51,866 --> 00:24:53,671
Right, Mom?

290
00:24:55,817 --> 00:24:59,759
I heard that there is a man
who is living with you two...

291
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:01,069
Ms. Song.

292
00:25:01,793 --> 00:25:04,787
I make a living on my own,
and raise my kid alone.

293
00:25:04,787 --> 00:25:07,940
I leave for work at 10 a.m.
and come home at 8 p.m.

294
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,689
so what am I supposed
to do with my child?

295
00:25:09,689 --> 00:25:12,048
Should I put a lock on the door
and lock her inside?

296
00:25:12,048 --> 00:25:18,143
Also, do I need to tell you two
if I'm seeing a man or not...

297
00:25:18,143 --> 00:25:20,259
just because you two are
my child's teachers?

298
00:25:24,108 --> 00:25:25,793
- Ow!
- Oh!

299
00:25:25,793 --> 00:25:28,280
Hye Na!
Are you all right?

300
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,857
Oh no, you're bleeding!

301
00:25:30,857 --> 00:25:33,962
Oh gosh, oh no!
Are you okay?

302
00:25:34,556 --> 00:25:35,556
Huh?

303
00:25:58,675 --> 00:26:01,271
You saw that, right?
She was acting.

304
00:26:02,546 --> 00:26:04,239
They say that a child
who is being abused

305
00:26:04,239 --> 00:26:07,847
protects their parent,
no matter what.

306
00:26:25,833 --> 00:26:28,009
Goodness.

307
00:26:32,788 --> 00:26:34,512
And what did the child say?

308
00:26:34,512 --> 00:26:36,315
She said that she tripped on the stairs.

309
00:26:36,315 --> 00:26:39,586
That makes no sense. You can't get
injuries like these from tripping!

310
00:26:41,271 --> 00:26:43,759
I believe that she's lying.
100 percent.

311
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:47,105
And her mother is saying
the same thing, as well.

312
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,529
I'm sure that she told her to say that.

313
00:26:50,663 --> 00:26:53,867
First, we'll have to put in
a request for some assistance

314
00:26:53,867 --> 00:26:55,745
and pay them a visit at home.

315
00:26:55,745 --> 00:26:57,443
We'll get an idea of
the situation then, and...

316
00:26:57,443 --> 00:26:58,720
What about after that?

317
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,092
To be honest, even if
a child has injuries like these

318
00:27:02,092 --> 00:27:07,288
if both the parent and child insist that
she tripped or bumped into something

319
00:27:07,288 --> 00:27:09,217
we can't do anything.

320
00:27:09,217 --> 00:27:13,935
So, our job is to visit them at home
to see if the child is safe there.

321
00:27:13,935 --> 00:27:16,248
And when necessary,
we'll work alongside the police

322
00:27:16,248 --> 00:27:17,906
and give them a stern warning.

323
00:27:17,906 --> 00:27:20,182
We'll keep an eye on them
for three to six months or so

324
00:27:20,182 --> 00:27:23,288
by paying them a visit at home
once a month, or something like that.

325
00:27:23,288 --> 00:27:26,502
Shouldn't we get that child
out of that home immediately?

326
00:27:26,502 --> 00:27:29,717
She doesn't only live with her mom!
There's a man who lives with them, too!

327
00:27:29,717 --> 00:27:32,805
Do you think her eardrum almost burst
because she was beaten by her mother?

328
00:27:32,805 --> 00:27:38,470
In Korea, parental authority is
considered to be quite important.

329
00:27:39,411 --> 00:27:42,092
According to the law, we can't
just ignore the parent's authority

330
00:27:42,092 --> 00:27:44,325
and forcibly investigate the home.

331
00:27:44,325 --> 00:27:49,388
And it's even more impossible to just
forcibly remove a child from her home.

332
00:28:00,208 --> 00:28:01,875
Hello?

333
00:28:03,102 --> 00:28:04,780
Is anyone home?

334
00:28:07,153 --> 00:28:08,627
This is the police!

335
00:28:10,539 --> 00:28:12,130
Is anyone home?

336
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:15,841
What brings you here?

337
00:28:15,841 --> 00:28:18,451
Is this the home of
Student Kim Hye Na?

338
00:28:19,787 --> 00:28:20,880
Yes, so?

339
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,394
We received a report

340
00:28:22,394 --> 00:28:24,914
so we will be confirming
if your child is faring well here.

341
00:28:24,914 --> 00:28:26,810
May we come in?

342
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:28,435
Wait.

343
00:28:28,435 --> 00:28:29,550
Um, sure.

344
00:28:36,738 --> 00:28:38,335
Kim Hye Na!

345
00:29:02,078 --> 00:29:03,708
Are you Hye Na?

346
00:29:06,175 --> 00:29:08,661
How did you injure your ear?

347
00:29:08,661 --> 00:29:11,040
I got hit by a ball.

348
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,791
A baseball.

349
00:29:13,307 --> 00:29:15,874
Why? Were you playing baseball?

350
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,608
I got hit by one on the street.

351
00:29:18,608 --> 00:29:20,150
While I was walking by.

352
00:29:22,239 --> 00:29:25,274
You're a good girl, aren't you?

353
00:29:25,274 --> 00:29:27,607
You can't lie to a police officer.

354
00:29:27,607 --> 00:29:29,953
We'll check all of the CCTV cameras.

355
00:29:29,953 --> 00:29:32,297
What are you doing right now?

356
00:29:32,297 --> 00:29:34,454
Are you threatening my child?

357
00:29:34,454 --> 00:29:37,498
Well, we're here because
we received a report.

358
00:29:37,498 --> 00:29:40,060
So we need to check
everything thoroughly.

359
00:29:44,097 --> 00:29:45,934
Hey, Jjing.

360
00:29:45,934 --> 00:29:48,560
Let's eat, Jjing.

361
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,330
You were hungry, weren't you?

362
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:53,287
I'll feed you, so let's eat.

363
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:56,748
<i>I'm really sorry, Honey.</i>

364
00:29:56,748 --> 00:29:59,024
<i>I'm sorry that I'm a
woman who has a daughter.</i>

365
00:29:59,024 --> 00:30:02,243
And I'm so thankful that
you're so understanding, but...

366
00:30:04,097 --> 00:30:05,934
But please, let me ask you one favor.

367
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:10,179
Leave her alone. Please?

368
00:30:10,777 --> 00:30:14,259
Things will be really difficult for me
if people keep showing up like this.

369
00:30:14,259 --> 00:30:16,291
If you really can't stand the kid

370
00:30:16,291 --> 00:30:18,896
should I send her off to an
orphanage or something, instead?

371
00:30:19,577 --> 00:30:21,241
<i>I'll give birth to your kid instead.</i>

372
00:30:21,241 --> 00:30:22,867
- Okay?
- Damn it!

373
00:30:31,048 --> 00:30:32,730
Don't go, Honey.

374
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,127
What am I supposed to do
if you just leave like this?

375
00:30:49,151 --> 00:30:54,151
<font color="#fcc89b">[DramaFever Ver] tvN E01 Mother</font>
<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

376
00:31:04,243 --> 00:31:05,791
Mom.

377
00:31:06,421 --> 00:31:08,095
I'm sorry.

378
00:31:08,095 --> 00:31:09,624
Go away.

379
00:31:10,392 --> 00:31:12,416
I said, go away!

380
00:31:12,416 --> 00:31:14,808
Go somewhere I can't see you!

381
00:31:47,304 --> 00:31:53,592
<i>Sweet potatoes...</i>

382
00:31:54,309 --> 00:31:58,145
<i>are delicious.</i>

383
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:04,405
<i>Delicious things...</i>

384
00:32:05,155 --> 00:32:10,287
<i>are...</i>

385
00:32:14,157 --> 00:32:17,325
<i>I heard that the child is
quite obedient to her mother.</i>

386
00:32:17,325 --> 00:32:19,421
It's because her mother is
the only person she can trust

387
00:32:19,421 --> 00:32:21,453
so the child has no choice
but to cling on to her.

388
00:32:21,453 --> 00:32:23,748
I've heard back from the police

389
00:32:23,748 --> 00:32:27,277
and I've requested help from
Child Protective Services as well

390
00:32:27,277 --> 00:32:29,844
but we have to treat this matter
with the utmost seriousness.

391
00:32:30,722 --> 00:32:36,211
A child, her family, and our school's
honor are all on the line here.

392
00:32:36,211 --> 00:32:41,059
Outsiders can't really get involved
too much in other families' matters.

393
00:32:42,028 --> 00:32:45,588
At any rate, I've already
visited the principal, too.

394
00:32:49,289 --> 00:32:52,161
I don't like this school or the cops.

395
00:32:52,161 --> 00:32:56,671
If they all sit and do nothing, aren't
they all just enabling domestic violence?

396
00:32:56,671 --> 00:32:58,769
Right?

397
00:32:58,769 --> 00:33:00,472
In my opinion...

398
00:33:01,554 --> 00:33:04,436
I think we should listen a bit more
to what Hye Na has to say.

399
00:33:04,436 --> 00:33:07,051
Hye Na is being manipulated
by her mother right now!

400
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:09,729
She said she tripped on the stairs
and got hit by a baseball!

401
00:33:09,729 --> 00:33:12,143
And you want us to keep listening
to this sort of nonsense?

402
00:33:12,961 --> 00:33:14,395
I think that Hye Na is saying that

403
00:33:14,395 --> 00:33:17,605
she's afraid to betray her mother,
who is her only blood relative.

404
00:33:18,347 --> 00:33:20,461
She's scared to say that
she got hit and was abused.

405
00:33:21,059 --> 00:33:24,712
She's embarrassed
to tell other people about it.

406
00:33:26,047 --> 00:33:31,438
And she's scared to be sent
to a facility full of strangers.

407
00:33:31,438 --> 00:33:34,005
I think those are the kinds of
things that she's saying to us.

408
00:33:34,005 --> 00:33:37,175
How long do you want us to just
sit and watch her get hit, then?

409
00:33:37,175 --> 00:33:39,233
Rather than referring to is as
"sitting and watching..."

410
00:33:39,233 --> 00:33:41,501
You're talking about this
as if it's someone else's problem.

411
00:33:41,501 --> 00:33:44,091
You don't want to become
a teacher, do you?

412
00:33:44,753 --> 00:33:46,585
Becoming a teacher means that

413
00:33:46,585 --> 00:33:50,326
you have to take on responsibilities
that may be difficult or troublesome!

414
00:33:50,326 --> 00:33:53,253
Do you honestly think that
I want to be doing this?

415
00:33:53,855 --> 00:33:56,006
My wedding is next week!

416
00:33:56,006 --> 00:33:58,768
I don't have time to be
going all over the place.

417
00:34:01,452 --> 00:34:03,411
I'll be going now.

418
00:34:24,107 --> 00:34:27,531
<i>She keeps asking me
if I like my mom.</i>

419
00:34:27,531 --> 00:34:29,658
<i>So, what did you say?</i>

420
00:34:29,658 --> 00:34:32,616
I told her that I like her a lot.

421
00:34:32,616 --> 00:34:34,683
<i>- Of course.
- Are you okay?</i>

422
00:34:34,683 --> 00:34:35,830
Huh?

423
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:37,569
<i>Are you relieved?</i>

424
00:35:03,993 --> 00:35:07,415
<i>She finished her master's at
the University of Wisconsin in 2008.</i>

425
00:35:07,415 --> 00:35:09,587
And in 2014, she was
working on her Ph.D

426
00:35:09,587 --> 00:35:12,033
at the University of Canterbury
in New Zealand

427
00:35:12,033 --> 00:35:14,647
and moved elsewhere three years ago.

428
00:35:14,647 --> 00:35:16,895
Her advisor from the university
in New Zealand changed

429
00:35:16,895 --> 00:35:19,415
so they said that they don't know
for sure where she went.

430
00:35:19,415 --> 00:35:21,522
They did say that they'd
look into it for us, but...

431
00:35:21,522 --> 00:35:22,656
Jae Beom.

432
00:35:22,656 --> 00:35:23,837
Yes, Ma'am?

433
00:35:23,837 --> 00:35:25,500
I want you to go.

434
00:35:26,129 --> 00:35:27,180
Where?

435
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:29,799
Do you really think they'll
try that hard for us

436
00:35:29,799 --> 00:35:32,160
when they couldn't truly know
just how much of a rush we're in?

437
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,520
So, I want you to go to New Zealand.

438
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,310
But, Ma'am!

439
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:39,669
You have events on your schedule here
and you're not in the best of health.

440
00:35:39,669 --> 00:35:41,194
So how could I leave you?

441
00:35:41,194 --> 00:35:42,712
And I can't speak English, either.

442
00:35:42,712 --> 00:35:43,962
Give us a moment.

443
00:35:49,991 --> 00:35:51,462
Jae Beom.

444
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,419
Yes, Ma'am?

445
00:35:54,982 --> 00:35:59,551
I'm not just asking you to
search for Soo Jin on a whim.

446
00:36:00,812 --> 00:36:02,877
For the past 10 years

447
00:36:02,877 --> 00:36:08,671
it was so hard for me to let her
roam free, doing as she wished.

448
00:36:15,725 --> 00:36:18,906
But I can't allow her to do that
anymore in my current state.

449
00:36:21,656 --> 00:36:23,029
Find her for me.

450
00:36:23,029 --> 00:36:24,540
I'm begging you.

451
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:25,756
Mom!

452
00:36:25,756 --> 00:36:27,714
Ah, you're here, Yi Jin?

453
00:36:28,924 --> 00:36:31,555
What's going on that
you're looking for Big Sis?

454
00:36:31,555 --> 00:36:33,428
I'll tell you later.

455
00:36:33,428 --> 00:36:36,084
She hasn't contacted us once
in the past 10 years.

456
00:36:36,084 --> 00:36:38,267
And yet, there's something
you can't tell me about

457
00:36:38,267 --> 00:36:40,203
but want to talk to her about?

458
00:36:40,203 --> 00:36:43,600
She's still your big sister,
whether she kept in touch or not.

459
00:36:44,346 --> 00:36:47,401
Just wait until we find her.

460
00:38:10,026 --> 00:38:11,671
Found you.

461
00:38:22,314 --> 00:38:23,919
Eat this.

462
00:38:26,895 --> 00:38:28,388
Eat this.

463
00:38:54,743 --> 00:38:56,290
Eat it quickly.

464
00:39:00,578 --> 00:39:02,439
How disgusting.

465
00:39:09,734 --> 00:39:11,564
So, when do they want you to come?

466
00:39:11,564 --> 00:39:13,616
As soon as possible.

467
00:39:13,616 --> 00:39:15,084
Congratulations.

468
00:39:15,817 --> 00:39:17,044
Thank you.

469
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:22,973
I used to buy you tons of food because
I thought you were from a poor family.

470
00:39:22,973 --> 00:39:24,676
I am.

471
00:39:24,676 --> 00:39:28,044
But your mom came looking for you
in your first year.

472
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,183
<i>Mom!</i>

473
00:39:37,104 --> 00:39:38,919
<i>Mom!</i>

474
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:43,203
There are a lot of cases in which the
mom is rich, but the daughter is poor.

475
00:39:43,203 --> 00:39:46,761
Feed yourself well there,
and don't be lonely.

476
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:48,636
All right.

477
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:50,111
I don't get lonely, though.

478
00:39:50,939 --> 00:39:53,991
Are you really not lonely at all,
even in the slightest?

479
00:39:54,622 --> 00:39:56,524
Haven't you ever liked someone
and wanted to be with them

480
00:39:56,524 --> 00:39:58,569
or gotten mad because
you cared for someone?

481
00:39:58,569 --> 00:39:59,993
You've never felt like that?

482
00:40:09,098 --> 00:40:11,015
I'm home.

483
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,435
What's this?

484
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:38,756
We were playing hide and seek.

485
00:40:38,756 --> 00:40:41,223
But I couldn't get out of here.

486
00:40:43,169 --> 00:40:44,680
Honey!

487
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,116
I really find these sorts of
pranks to be quite scary!

488
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:50,055
What if someone came here and saw this?

489
00:40:52,227 --> 00:40:54,285
Go outside and play.

00:42:26,904 --> 00:42:29,015
Yeah, sure.

Why not?

513
00:43:40,741 --> 00:43:43,240
Because I can't read quickly.

514
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:44,575
Really?

515
00:43:45,142 --> 00:43:46,422

that your mom is good at cooking, Hye Na.

Yes! And my mom is really pretty, too!

531
00:44:56,236 --> 00:44:57,419
Really?

532
00:44:57,419 --> 00:44:59,437
She's really good at putting on makeup

533
00:44:59,437 --> 00:45:01,692
and she works at a cosmetics store.

534
00:45:01,692 --> 00:45:03,665
So she smells nice.

535
00:45:04,508 --> 00:45:06,053
But...

536
00:45:06,053 --> 00:45:08,348
why don't you ever put on
any makeup, Ms. Kang?

537
00:45:13,207 --> 00:45:16,158
My mom is really pretty, too.

538
00:45:16,767 --> 00:45:19,218
And she's really good at
putting on makeup, too.

539
00:45:19,922 --> 00:45:24,100
When I was young and watched my mom
put on makeup, I thought to myself...

540
00:45:24,774 --> 00:45:26,881
that there was no way
that I could do it.

541
00:45:27,386 --> 00:45:29,145
And that I should just
give up altogether.

542
00:45:30,259 --> 00:45:34,893
You didn't want to become
like your mom, Ms. Kang?

543
00:45:37,908 --> 00:45:39,125
Yeah.

544
00:45:39,892 --> 00:45:42,408
Did you...

545
00:45:43,609 --> 00:45:45,558
not like your mom, Ms. Kang?

546
00:45:51,323 --> 00:45:54,444
Then, who do you like, Ms. Kang?

547
00:45:58,616 --> 00:45:59,796
I like birds.

548
00:46:01,881 --> 00:46:09,325
"The birds... started..."

549
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:14,325

"and they are now already in Egypt."

551
00:46:22,015 --> 00:46:23,692
Migratory birds fly across oceans...

552
00:46:24,098 --> 00:46:27,216
on journeys that are sometimes
tens of thousands of kilometers long.

553
00:46:27,711 --> 00:46:30,125
And yet, they never lose their way.

554
00:46:30,736 --> 00:46:34,167
Rain or snow, day or night...

555
00:46:34,167 --> 00:46:36,160
they fly over chilly oceans...

556
00:46:37,073 --> 00:46:39,232
without any maps or landmarks
to follow as reference.

557
00:46:39,232 --> 00:46:41,495
But they always reach their
destination, no matter what.

558
00:46:41,495 --> 00:46:42,830
Wow!

559
00:46:43,254 --> 00:46:47,435
Because they have maps
and directions, all in their heads.

560
00:46:48,087 --> 00:46:53,008
What do you think it feels like
to fly such long distances?

561
00:46:54,883 --> 00:46:56,542
Want to go see them?

562
00:46:57,267 --> 00:46:58,859
The migratory birds, I mean.

563
00:46:58,859 --> 00:47:00,408
When?

564
00:47:00,895 --> 00:47:03,252
It's too cold right now.

565
00:47:03,252 --> 00:47:08,167
So if we get some sleep and
bring a blanket and some warm food...

566
00:47:11,428 --> 00:47:14,143
But then, my mom...

567
00:47:14,968 --> 00:47:18,004
My mom might worry,
don't you think?

568
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:29,332
Yes?

569
00:47:30,511 --> 00:47:31,839
Yes.

570
00:47:32,973 --> 00:47:34,408
Yes.

571
00:47:36,625 --> 00:47:38,586

check to see if she's safe for me?

586
00:49:33,185 --> 00:49:35,174
What do I need to check on, exactly?

If she's attending school
and is getting home safely.

I don't know. I feel like
something will happen.

589
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:45,127
Is she a student in your class?

590
00:49:45,127 --> 00:49:46,743
- Yes.
- So, why?

591
00:49:46,743 --> 00:49:48,153
I'm worried.

592
00:49:48,153 --> 00:49:50,977
I'm so worried that
I feel like I'll get angry!

593
00:49:57,886 --> 00:50:00,221
I saw the man who lives
with her and her mother.

594
00:50:01,683 --> 00:50:03,953
It was the first time
that I'd ever seen him, but...

595
00:50:05,354 --> 00:50:07,647
he had a look in his eyes
that I am familiar with.

596
00:50:08,828 --> 00:50:12,031
The look of a beast who

Well, at any rate,

I'm sure things were quite tough on you

You didn't cry, right?

627

00:55:05,726 --> 00:55:08,376
Falling from the first floor...

639
00:55:09,041 --> 00:55:11,393
won't kill me.

640
00:55:14,353 --> 00:55:17,355
<i>When balloons get bigger and bigger.</i>

641
00:55:17,355 --> 00:55:19,766
Want me to tell you
what I did to Jjing?

642
00:55:22,087 --> 00:55:24,878
I pressed down on her
really hard, like this.

643
00:55:24,878 --> 00:55:26,494
Really, really hard.

644
00:55:27,328 --> 00:55:29,659
<i>The road that leads to the ocean.</i>

645
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:31,561
And then, do you know
what happened to her?

646
00:55:32,925 --> 00:55:37,014
Her eyes swelled up
like a shrimp's eyes...

647
00:55:38,063 --> 00:55:40,936
and they popped right out of her head.

648
00:55:40,936 --> 00:55:42,947
There was this liquid,
the color of blood.

649
00:55:43,886 --> 00:55:47,059
And there was also this sticky thing
mixed in there, like saliva.

650
00:55:47,059 --> 00:55:48,599
All right?

651
00:55:49,213 --> 00:55:50,750
<i>The sun reflecting on the ocean.</i>

652
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:51,853
All right?

653
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:04,550
You're disgusting, all right?

654
00:56:06,509 --> 00:56:08,695
You're disgusting.

655
00:56:36,797 --> 00:56:38,442
Mom!

656
00:56:41,382 --> 00:56:42,708
<i>Mom.</i>

657
00:56:42,708 --> 00:56:45,304
<i>When my mom hugs me tight.</i>

658
00:56:45,304 --> 00:56:46,953
How disgusting!

659
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:55,257
How disgusting!

660
00:57:00,282 --> 00:57:01,726
<i>[Cafe Latte]</i>

661
00:57:01,726 --> 00:57:03,476
<i>Cafe Latte.</i>

662
00:57:05,179 --> 00:57:07,366
What time is the movie?

663
00:57:07,366 --> 00:57:09,751
I want to have a nice,
sweet cup of coffee.

664
00:57:09,751 --> 00:57:12,128
I need to get myself together, too.

665
00:57:20,668 --> 00:57:22,597
<i>Cafe latte.</i>

666
00:57:31,264 --> 00:57:35,308
<i>The first day that
Ms. Kang Soo Jin smiled.</i>

667
00:58:58,290 --> 00:59:00,387
I'm sorry.

668
00:59:16,942 --> 00:59:18,790
I'm sorry.

669
00:59:35,728 --> 00:59:38,741
Would you like some water, Hye Na?

670
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:47,701
Is there anything you want to eat?

671
00:59:51,927 --> 00:59:53,639
Would you like...

672
00:59:54,221 --> 00:59:55,607
a cafe latte?

673
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:06,482
I want to go see...

674
01:00:08,762 --> 01:00:12,143
the migratory birds, Ms. Kang.

675
01:00:34,612 --> 01:00:37,851
I'll tell you a secret.

676
01:00:43,543 --> 01:00:45,929
His name was...

677
01:00:46,568 --> 01:00:48,721
Lee Hwan.

678
01:00:50,411 --> 01:00:54,308
When Uncle was living with him and Mom...

679
01:00:55,588 --> 01:00:59,067
he was being too noisy...

680
01:00:59,552 --> 01:01:02,496
so Uncle threw him off the balcony.

681
01:01:04,454 --> 01:01:07,619
But that apartment
was on the fourth floor.

682
01:01:12,871 --> 01:01:14,871
You don't have to tell me.

683
01:01:15,574 --> 01:01:17,639
Don't tell me if it's scary
for you to remember.

684
01:01:21,337 --> 01:01:25,248
At the time, he was five years old...

685
01:01:26,476 --> 01:01:30,565
and died, so he can't become
an elementary schooler anymore.

686
01:01:31,386 --> 01:01:35,467
He attended Long Legs Kindergarten,
and was in the Ongdalsaem Class...

687
01:01:36,337 --> 01:01:38,965
so I wrote his name
in my notebook.

688
01:01:40,405 --> 01:01:46,909
Even if all of his classmates
and teachers forget his name...

689
01:01:47,353 --> 01:01:49,869
I will never forget it.

690
01:01:50,918 --> 01:01:55,610
Because the only person
who knows how he really died...

691
01:01:56,938 --> 01:01:59,471
is me.

692
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:04,291
Uncle told me that he'd kill me...

693
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:07,753
if I told someone else.

694
01:03:01,793 --> 01:03:05,063
<i>Hey, you guys!
Where are you all going?</i>

695
01:03:05,063 --> 01:03:07,938
<i>Can't you take me with you?</i>

696
01:03:07,938 --> 01:03:10,603
<i>Take me away with you!</i>

697
01:03:11,529 --> 01:03:13,215
<i>Far away!</i>

698
01:03:13,215 --> 01:03:15,523
<i>Far, far away!</i>

699
01:03:17,286 --> 01:03:19,286
<i>To Heaven!</i>

700
01:03:52,911 --> 01:03:54,280
Hye Na.

701
01:03:54,844 --> 01:03:56,346
Listen to me carefully.

702
01:03:57,795 --> 01:03:59,956
I will take you away.

703
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:02,117
To a place several
thousand kilometers away

704
01:04:02,117 --> 01:04:03,373
where nobody will find you.

705
01:04:04,061 --> 01:04:08,712
Won't you go to jail
if you do that, Ms. Kang?

706
01:04:10,895 --> 01:04:12,496
I could.

707
01:04:12,496 --> 01:04:14,683
No, Ms. Kang!

708
01:04:16,918 --> 01:04:18,693
You don't have to leave with me.

709
01:04:19,221 --> 01:04:21,578
If you leave, you'll never
be able to come back.

710
01:04:22,166 --> 01:04:24,367
And you'll never be able
to see your mom again, either.

711
01:04:25,943 --> 01:04:28,398
But if you go back home...

712
01:04:29,058 --> 01:04:32,956
you may end up like Lee Hwan
from Ongdalsaem Class one day, too.

713
01:04:34,172 --> 01:04:39,197
Why is it that a child
can't survive without a mother?

714
01:04:39,197 --> 01:04:40,467
They can.

715
01:04:41,482 --> 01:04:43,543
And I'll help you so that you can.

716
01:04:43,543 --> 01:04:46,985
My mom threw me away
in the trash bin!

717
01:04:56,001 --> 01:04:57,790
And now...

718
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:00,717
you will be the one
throwing your mom away.

719
01:05:06,514 --> 01:05:07,945
Will you be able to do it?
