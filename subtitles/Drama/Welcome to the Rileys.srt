1
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:05,357
Hey, Riley. You in or you out?

2
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:13,358
l tried telling it the other day,
and l screwed it all up.

3
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:14,794
What pickle-slicer joke?

4
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:16,161
Oh, well, this guy...

5
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:19,702
...he works at a pickle factory,
and he goes home and tells his wife...

6
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:24,343
...that he got fired because he stuck
his dick in a pickle-slicer. That one.

7
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:26,673
-Sounds hilarious.
-She says:

8
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,849
''You stuck your dick in a pickle-slicer.
Are you all right?''

9
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:33,382
And he answers back with something,
and that's the part l can't remember.

10
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:38,751
She asks if he's all right, and he says,
''lt's not so bad. They fired her too.''

11
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:41,893
-There you go.
-lf you say so.

12
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:06,909
How'd you do tonight?

13
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,111
Broke even.

14
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:11,483
Give or take a grand.

15
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,852
Lost again, huh?

16
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,322
Who says l lost?

17
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,792
''Broke even'' means you lost.

18
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:20,124
''l did all right'' means you won.

19
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:23,029
-Who says so?
-Me.

20
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:25,095
l got you down cold.

21
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:27,865
Remind me never to play poker
with you.

22
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:29,939
lt's a waste of money if you ask me.

23
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:32,703
Well, l never do ask you,
but that hasn't stopped you...

24
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:35,403
...from telling me that
every Thursday night...

25
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:39,073
-...for the last, what?
-Hey, Vivian.

26
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:40,809
Four years.

27
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:45,849
-There you go.
-Thank you.

28
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:56,328
Four years?

29
00:03:58,004 --> 00:04:00,234
Am l boring you?

30
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,408
No, ma'am.

31
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:03,735
Am l boring you?

32
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:06,302
Not yet.

33
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:12,408
Waffle man.

34
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:18,049
l got this convention
to go to in New Orleans...

35
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,886
...at the end of the month.

36
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,029
Why don't you come along?

37
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,238
-Don't do that.
-What?

38
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:35,999
-Be unpredictable.
-Come on. We'll have fun.

39
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:40,043
Just the two of us. Why not?

40
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,847
l mean it.

41
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:47,749
-l don't even have a suitcase.
-l'll buy you a suitcase.

42
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:54,321
How about you buy me dinner
at the Canterbury?

43
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:57,428
l like their spinach salad.

44
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:03,097
All you want for your birthday
is a spinach salad...

45
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,362
...when you can have a trip
to New Orleans?

46
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:09,133
-l don't know. l just....
-All right. Just....

47
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:12,036
Just think about it.

48
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,613
Okay.

49
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:25,749
Baby, it is time for you to go home.

50
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:28,560
-Nope.
-Get some sleep.

51
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:30,490
Ten more minutes.

52
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:33,961
All right.

53
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:08,125
How was your poker game?

54
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:11,030
Broke even, just about.

55
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,674
Want me turn out the light?

56
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,309
Nope. Doesn't bother me.

57
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:20,843
Good night.

58
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,842
Sweet dreams.

59
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:27,214
You too.

60
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:07,789
--and questions about other stuff
that brings up...

61
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:10,189
...a whole can of worms, you know?

62
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:12,364
We're just gonna take the RV...

63
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:15,227
...and park the motor home
in our backyard...

64
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:19,269
...wait for her to kick the bucket,
l guess.

65
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:23,272
And watch over her
and take care of her until then.

66
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:25,273
Sure gonna miss you, Brenda.

67
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:29,380
Oh, Lois. l'm gonna miss you too.

68
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:35,382
l got my grandkids up here.
l'll be back up here from time to time.

69
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:37,885
Would you like
some more coffee, Sharon?

70
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,422
Oh, no, thank you, Mrs. Riley.

71
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,890
Call me Lois, honey.

72
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:48,066
Where is your bathroom?
Coffee goes right through me.

73
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:52,636
Right down at the end of the hall.
Can't miss it.

74
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:57,036
But, you know, you'll be
in great hands with Sharon.

75
00:07:57,243 --> 00:08:00,508
She's a real whiz.

76
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:12,517
Besides, Walt's just tired of living
in lndianapolis.

77
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,723
-You have a beautiful home.
-Thank you.

78
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,457
How old is your daughter?

79
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:25,930
Did you see Lois' craft room?

80
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:30,199
She.... She paints
and does pastels and all that.

81
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:33,276
She's a real artist.

82
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:45,688
Hey.

83
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:47,291
-Hey, Doug.
-Yeah?

84
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:50,587
Hey, can l talk to you outside
for a second?

85
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:52,525
-Yeah.
-Okay.

86
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:53,960
Sure.

87
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:01,635
Where's Viv?

88
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,506
l tried to get ahold of you
at your office, Doug...

89
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:08,771
...but l didn't wanna leave a message
with your secretary.

90
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:10,881
What message?

91
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:14,616
Doug, Vivian's dead.

92
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,712
lt was a heart attack.

93
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,450
You gonna sit out here all night?

94
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:54,649
Just smoking a cigarette.

95
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,191
Wish you wouldn't smoke
in the house.

96
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:02,634
Well, l'm not in the house.
l'm in the garage.

97
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:09,967
When you open the door,
all the smoke comes inside.

98
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:12,201
Then close the door, Lois.

99
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:30,004
What are you doing home so early?

100
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:36,710
That headstone you got us
at Gold Hill...

101
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,947
...that's a unique experience.

102
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:42,761
Seeing your name
carved on a piece of granite.

103
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:46,454
-How do you mean?
-Well, l mean l'm not dead.

104
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:48,565
And you're not dead.

105
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,066
Now, there's enough people out there
that are dead.

106
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:53,602
They need headstones.

107
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:55,899
We don't. Because we're not dead.

108
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:59,600
A lot of people do this, Doug.
lt's called pre-planning.

109
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:04,579
Well, l don't like having my name
carved on a tombstone...

110
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,809
...while l'm still alive.

111
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:12,086
l can't believe you did that, Lois.

112
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:29,990
-Hello?
-Kind of early, aren't you?

113
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:33,562
Oh, yeah. Traffic, you know.
Gonna be a bear.

114
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,461
Doug, let's go.

115
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:39,035
l just hate driving to the airport.

116
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:44,239
Do you mind picking up my mail
and newspaper while Doug is gone?

117
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,638
Why can't your neighbor
across the street do it?

118
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:49,643
-She moved.
-What about all your other neighbors?

119
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:51,816
Just till Doug gets back.

120
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:56,111
Okay. l have to drive over here
all the way from Zionsville every day...

121
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:59,416
...because my nutcase sister can't
walk down her own damn driveway.

122
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,320
Lois?

123
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,624
Somehow, someway,
and someday...

124
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:08,061
...you're just gonna have to
walk out that door.

125
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:10,261
Give me a Sweet'N Low.

126
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:41,862
So l sent every truck we own
down to the construction site...

127
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:44,865
...paid off the night watchman,
and we went floor by floor...

128
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:49,029
...and pulled every one of our fixtures:
faucets, sinks, fire-hose valves...

129
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:51,607
...drinking fountains, sprinkler heads,
you name it.

130
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:54,142
You're lucky they didn't charge you
with breaking and entering.

131
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:57,440
l'm not standing at the back of the line
in some bankruptcy hearing.

132
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:01,949
Screw that. Pay me,
or l'll repo your sorrowful, broke ass.

133
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:06,818
That's why it's 30 days net with us.
Why go 90 days out with someone?

134
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,256
l don't need that kind of suspense.

135
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:10,860
Right, Doug?

136
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:15,133
No surprises. That's my motto.

137
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:18,936
-Gonna hit the little boys' room.
-All right.

138
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:27,141
-How are you? How you doing?
-Hey, Doug.

139
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:28,938
How you doing, man?

140
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:32,548
Here we go.

141
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,417
-Hey.
-Hey, Doug.

142
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,223
Where you going?

143
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:26,169
Right there. Thank you.

144
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:09,334
-How you doing tonight?
-l'm okay. How about you?

145
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,600
-Oh, l'm real good.
-Good.

146
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:15,306
You want a private lap dance
in the VlP room?

147
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:16,503
What?

148
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,740
You want a private lap dance
in the VlP room?

149
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:23,979
-No, not right now. Thank you.
-Not right now? Sorry.

150
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:26,749
-l'm gonna be off work soon.
-All right. Wait.

151
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,785
Come on. lt's right upstairs.

152
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:32,930
lt's only 250. You get a bottle
of champagne and me for an hour.

153
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:35,326
-l don't drink champagne.
-l do.

154
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:37,631
Thank you, but....

155
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:41,237
Come on. An hour.
Just you and me.

156
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:45,307
Shit.

157
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,474
-You know those guys?
-Yep.

158
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,045
You want the room?

159
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,511
Oh, hello.

160
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:54,777
-All right.
-Give me a hand?

161
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:15,399
Make yourself comfortable.

162
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:25,045
l'm Mallory. What's your name?

163
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,615
Doug.

164
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,982
-lt's nice to meet you, Doug.
-Nice to meet you too.

165
00:21:30,188 --> 00:21:33,817
We actually have to wait for the drinks
to come before we can have any fun.

166
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:36,551
Wait. Hold on.

167
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,757
l'm not here for the fun part.

168
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:45,467
Well...

169
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:48,069
...hand jobs are 50...

170
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:52,710
...and l can do oral, but it's 1 00,
and you'd need a rubber.

171
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:54,503
No, thank you.

172
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:59,780
l get 60 out of the 250
you gave the guy at the bar.

173
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,116
You're not gonna tip me nothing?

174
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,754
All right.

175
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:11,528
Here. This make it worth
your while?

176
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:14,665
-Knock, knock.
-Thanks, Doug.

177
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:16,333
Hi.

178
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:18,396
There you go.

179
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:22,771
l'll need you to sign this
for downstairs.

180
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:24,942
Plus the champagne.

181
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:30,308
Hey, Tara.

182
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,875
-Here you go.
-You gonna tip the girl?

183
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:40,790
-Wouldn't wanna forget to do that.
-No, we wouldn't.

184
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:44,258
-There you go.
-Thanks.

185
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:48,958
-Y'all have a good time, okay?
-Come here.

186
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:52,330
Come here. lt's okay. Over here.

187
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:55,802
l really, really like older guys.

188
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:59,101
-They get me really wet.
-Yeah. Sweetheart. Sweetheart. Just--

189
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:02,814
Sit still. Sit still.

190
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:08,418
You don't wanna have any fun?

191
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:11,214
-How about we just talk?
-Do you want me to talk dirty...

192
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:16,360
-...so you can get yourself off?
-Jesus Christ. No. No. Okay?

193
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:22,356
Well, all right.

194
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:25,127
You don't have to get mad at me.
lt's fine.

195
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:29,330
l'm not mad at you.
Just persistent, that's all.

196
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:30,803
Now....

197
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:36,506
-Trying to keep the customers happy.
-l'm happy. l'm happy.

198
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:39,143
You don't look very happy.

199
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:55,525
How old are you?

200
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:58,259
-How old do l look?
-Fifteen.

201
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:01,303
You can't be 1 5 and work
in any strip club l've ever heard of.

202
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:02,871
-How old are you?
-Twenty-two.

203
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:04,701
You don't look 22.

204
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:07,141
That's what it says on my lD.

205
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:10,246
Well, l could buy a driver's license
says l'm 22.

206
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:11,916
That doesn't make me 22.

207
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,311
So is Mallory your real name?

208
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:20,420
-You-- Fuck me. You're a fucking cop?
-No.

209
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:23,594
Oh, you're not a cop? Then come here
and show me your cock, then.

210
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:25,422
-Stop it. Stop that.
-Yeah?

211
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,598
-Prove you're not a cop!
-l'm not a cop.

212
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:30,165
Take this back.
That's about as close to my pussy...

213
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:32,734
...as you're gonna get tonight,
fuck nuts.

214
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,952
Hey. How's it shaking, baby?

215
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:56,059
lt ain't. Felix kicked me out early.
There's too many girls in tonight.

216
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:58,729
Can l get a meatball po'boy
to go? Thanks.

217
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:22,109
Excuse me. l'm not a cop.

218
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,016
l'm from lndianapolis, lndiana.

219
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:29,650
l run a wholesale
plumbing-supply business.

220
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:33,161
l'm here for a convention.

221
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:43,907
Okay. l'm sorry about that.

222
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:48,675
l just got cops on the brain,
you know? Can't help it.

223
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,006
Snooping around the club.

224
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:54,276
And they just towed my car
for unpaid parking tickets.

225
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:57,353
lt's like 35 bucks a day
in storage fees, and l don't got that.

226
00:25:57,556 --> 00:26:00,616
lt's been in there for like a week.
How the fuck can l get it out?

227
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,784
So, anyway, that's....

228
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,260
That's why l don't like cops.

229
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:09,496
How much do you owe?

230
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:12,433
Eleven hundred for the tickets...

231
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:16,363
...and l guess whatever 35
times seven is.

232
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:19,806
-Two hundred and forty-five dollars.
-What is that altogether?

233
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:25,942
Well, $ 1 1 00 plus $2 45 is $ 1 345.

234
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:29,820
Fuck me.

235
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:34,017
You have a terrible vocabulary.

236
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:39,520
-Fuck you.
-All right.

237
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:41,426
l didn't...

238
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:43,694
...mean that...

239
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:45,836
...that way.

240
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:50,866
Me neither.

241
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:01,009
Here you go, babe.

242
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:04,478
Anyway....

243
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,555
l got it. l got it.

244
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:16,394
Sorry.

245
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:22,433
-Where you from?
-Why?

246
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,770
Just making conversation.

247
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:32,215
l'm from Florida.

248
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:35,486
Where in Florida?

249
00:27:36,521 --> 00:27:40,184
-Panhandle.
-And you work in a strip club?

250
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:44,419
Better than working peep shows
in Atlanta.

251
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:48,065
Guys jerking off,
staring at your cooter...

252
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:51,064
...like it was singing
''The-Star-Spangled-fucking-Banner.''

253
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:58,298
Here.

254
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:16,819
Hey, you think...?

255
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:19,727
l mean, now that, you know....

256
00:28:19,931 --> 00:28:22,456
Now that l know you're not a cop...

257
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:26,364
...do you think l could have
that 1 00 bucks back?

258
00:28:27,505 --> 00:28:31,373
l mean, you said you just wanted
to talk, right? And we've been talking.

259
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:35,804
And l could do something else for
the money too, if you want. l mean....

260
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,115
You can have your money back.

261
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:44,880
-Put it away.
-l know. Thanks. Thank you.

262
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:53,861
lt's getting late. l'll take you home.

263
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:00,466
lt's just a ways down this street,
so just....

264
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:04,537
This is your neighborhood?

265
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:06,436
Yep.

266
00:29:09,981 --> 00:29:13,576
lt's this whitish one, right here.

267
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:18,954
Hey, do you mind coming in
with me for a second...

268
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:22,490
...just to make sure it's chill?
My electricity's off.

269
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:25,827
All right.

270
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:37,905
Motherfuck.

271
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:49,320
Shouldn't keep your key
in your mailbox.

272
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:51,785
l'd just lose it if l didn't.

273
00:30:03,768 --> 00:30:06,669
Jesus. You weren't kidding.

274
00:30:06,871 --> 00:30:08,702
l know.

275
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:11,432
Place gets really fucking creepy.

276
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:41,268
How come you haven't paid
your electric bill?

277
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:43,765
l have.

278
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:48,111
My landlord keeps locking
the fuse box.

279
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:51,373
lt's supposed to be included
in the rent, but he's, like, this....

280
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:55,486
He's, like, this freak who wants me
to suck him off while he videotapes it.

281
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:58,622
He's a regular at the club.
lt's this whole scam he's got going.

282
00:30:58,823 --> 00:31:01,223
He only rents the place to strippers.

283
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:05,319
But l told him, like, ''l'm not gonna
do your blow-job videos...

284
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:08,863
...and l'm not leaving,
because l got my rights.''

285
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:14,469
And he tries to scare me with this
''for sale'' sign shit. Like, yeah.

286
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:17,573
Like people are dying
to buy this shithole.

287
00:31:20,578 --> 00:31:22,546
-You wanna smoke a spliff?
-What?

288
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:26,511
Like, a doobie.
You know, like, a joint. Weed.

289
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,447
Marijuana?

290
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:31,888
Yeah.

291
00:31:32,857 --> 00:31:36,315
l haven't smoked marijuana
in 20-odd years.

292
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:45,599
-What's so funny?
-This whole night.

293
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,904
l feel like l landed on Mars.

294
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:54,601
Well, welcome to New Orleans.

295
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:57,781
Yeah.

296
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:25,372
Here.

297
00:32:56,774 --> 00:32:58,241
How come
you don't wanna fuck me?

298
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:03,436
-l prefer women my own age.
-Why?

299
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:06,813
They know what they're doing.

300
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:12,153
-l'm pretty good.
-Sure, you are.

301
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:17,689
-l think l give some pretty good head.
-l'm sure you do.

302
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:20,924
-Let me show you.
-No. No.

303
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:25,165
Lie down.

304
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:30,831
lt is so weird...

305
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:34,672
...being with a guy
who don't wanna get it on.

306
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:40,781
Yeah, well,
it's pretty weird being with you too.

307
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,785
You don't like me?

308
00:33:46,824 --> 00:33:49,258
l do. l like you a lot.

309
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:55,526
l like the train.

310
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:16,384
l like you too.

311
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:58,785
-Hello?
-Where in the hell are you?

312
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:02,389
l overslept.

313
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,728
Goddamn.
Banged on your door for five minutes.

314
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:08,304
<i>You all right?</i>

315
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:10,704
Yeah.

316
00:35:10,908 --> 00:35:12,500
Yeah, l'm fine.

317
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,735
Why didn't you check in
with Lois yet?

318
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,914
<i>Just talked to Harriet.</i>

Yeah. Yeah, l'm all right.
l'll see you at the convention.

322
00:36:47,004 --> 00:36:49,336
And get that jacket of yours
back from that girl.

323
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:52,104
Personal space.

324
00:36:52,843 --> 00:36:55,539
Stop loaning your things to people.

325
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:58,842
-Riley residence.
-<i>Hey.</i>

326
00:37:59,543 --> 00:38:03,343
<i>Sorry l didn't call</i>
<i>when l got in last night.</i>

327
00:38:04,582 --> 00:38:07,551
Well, l checked your flight
on the lnternet...

328
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:10,346
...so l know you didn't crash.

329
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:12,249
How's New Orleans?

330
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:15,084
<i>Listen, l think</i>
<i>l'm going to stay here...</i>

331
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,090
<i>...for a while.</i>

332
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:21,254
<i>Can't come home right now.</i>

333
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,262
What are you talking about?

334
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,867
<i>l don't know. l don't know.</i>

335
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:28,095
<i>But l just know that...</i>

336
00:38:28,939 --> 00:38:31,407
<i>...l can't come home right now.</i>

337
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:34,775
<i>l know l'm not dead yet.</i>

338
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:39,546
-<i>All right?</i>
-Doug...

339
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:44,584
...l'm not mad about Vivian.

340
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:47,016
What?

341
00:38:47,725 --> 00:38:50,888
<i>A year or two ago,</i>
<i>l found a nametag...</i>

342
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:54,030
<i>...in the pocket</i>
<i>of your windbreaker.</i>

343
00:38:54,231 --> 00:38:59,168
<i>lt's not like l had no idea</i>
<i>what was going on.</i>

344
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:02,066
<i>And l know l haven't been....</i>

345
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:10,405
-Oh, Lord.
-<i>l'm sorry. l am.</i>

346
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:25,624
l'll make a list of people
you gotta take care of.

347
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,388
-l will. We got a deal?
-Not yet.

348
00:39:27,598 --> 00:39:28,656
But almost?

349
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,697
-You got the money?
-Shake?

350
00:39:30,901 --> 00:39:31,890
-Almost.
-All right.

351
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:34,571
Oh, God. Not guilty.

352
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:37,432
Morning, Ham. How are you?

353
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:40,633
Had ourselves some French Quarter
fun last night, didn't we?

354
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:43,439
Took old Jer to the swankiest
strip joint in the Quarter.

355
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:46,275
And l'm talking tender to the bone.

356
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:49,342
-Give us a minute, will you?
-Oh, you bet.

357
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:53,011
We'll have ourselves a good time
tonight, boys, so take your vitamins.

358
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:55,454
l like the blue ones, myself.

359
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:59,855
-So, what's up?
-l'm selling Circle City.

360
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:03,196
Are you fucking nuts?

361
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,527
What's going on with you?

362
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:06,828
You're gonna make a good profit
on your shares.

363
00:40:07,037 --> 00:40:09,369
You're gonna get a nice bump
to run the company.

364
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:12,974
-Don't do this to me.
-Do what? Make you richer?

365
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:15,168
-You'll get over it.
-Wait. Hey.

366
00:40:15,379 --> 00:40:16,846
Goddamn it. So, what--?

367
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:20,244
l mean, what,
you're just gonna pull the plug?

368
00:40:20,451 --> 00:40:21,679
Yep.

369
00:40:21,886 --> 00:40:24,548
Christ, Doug.
Where the hell are you going now?

370
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,848
Need a pair of bolt cutters
and a toilet snake.

371
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,629
Morning.

372
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,330
Jesus Chr--

373
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:17,239
Turn the water on in the tub
so l can rinse this thing off.

374
00:41:19,276 --> 00:41:21,301
Oh, my God. l'm out of here.

375
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:38,242
Got a business proposition for you.

376
00:43:41,986 --> 00:43:44,011
Well, l told you
that l don't do porn tapes.

377
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:46,018
l'm not gonna fuck
your German shepherd.

378
00:43:46,223 --> 00:43:49,886
-l'm not going to Tokyo to turn tricks.
-Can l just talk for a minute?

379
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:52,856
Yes. But the answer's no.

380
00:43:57,267 --> 00:43:59,758
l'll give you $ 1 00 a day
to stay at your place.

381
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:03,401
-What?
-One hundred dollars a day...

382
00:44:03,607 --> 00:44:07,475
...if l can stay at your place.
l don't like hotels.

383
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,342
No pussy?

384
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,208
No.

385
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:19,047
And l don't do anal either,
just so you know.

386
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:22,422
Thank God
there's something you don't do.

387
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:30,061
So 1 00 bucks a day,
and you just live at my house?

388
00:44:30,267 --> 00:44:31,632
Yep.

389
00:44:34,271 --> 00:44:36,102
So you'll be my sugar daddy?

390
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:39,138
-You know what that is?
-Kind of.

391
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:42,472
You'll buy me cool things.

392
00:44:44,715 --> 00:44:47,115
l'll buy you a broom and a dustpan.

393
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:23,816
lt's me, Charlene, Mrs. Riley.

394
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:25,681
You remember me, don't you?

395
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:29,052
l saw the garage open.
Didn't look right to me.

396
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:32,194
-You okay in there?
-Just taking a nap.

397
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:35,990
You want your paper?

398
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:40,559
Put it on the hood, please?

399
00:45:51,715 --> 00:45:54,946
Shouldn't leave your garage door
open like that.

400
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,215
l know.

401
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:00,356
Thank you.

402
00:46:00,557 --> 00:46:02,252
Good to see you.

403
00:46:02,459 --> 00:46:04,051
Been a long time.

404
00:46:37,227 --> 00:46:39,991
-Evening.
-Hi.

405
00:46:40,197 --> 00:46:43,724

00:46:44,268 --> 00:46:46,259

407
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:50,463
-Who?
-Oh, you know, Bridgette.

408
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:53,106

409
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:55,175
-Jennifer?
-Mallory?

410
00:46:55,379 --> 00:46:58,871
Yeah. Mallory. She home?

411
00:46:59,082 --> 00:47:02,176
-No, she's at work.
-Saw the lights on.

412
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:08,424
You wanna leave her
a message or...?

413
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:11,685
Oh, just dropping by. No big thing.

414
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:14,125
Another time.

415
00:47:23,407 --> 00:47:24,806
Good night.

416
00:47:41,825 --> 00:47:44,658
l got a lot of 20s tonight.
That's crazy.

417
00:47:45,996 --> 00:47:47,327
Shit.

418
00:47:49,933 --> 00:47:54,597
Okay. Here's another three,
four, five-- Fuck.

419
00:47:55,606 --> 00:47:57,506
Wait. Ten.

420
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,642
Twenty.

421
00:48:01,845 --> 00:48:05,008
Okay, that's 30--

422
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:07,809
First of all,
put your money in the right order.

423
00:48:08,018 --> 00:48:12,148
Twenties, tens, fives, ones.

424
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:15,183
-Okay. Chill out.
-Show your money some respect.

425
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:18,690
Oh, l respect money.

426
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:21,657
Oh, fuck.

427
00:48:24,434 --> 00:48:27,335
God. Somebody open
a can of tuna fish?

428
00:48:32,843 --> 00:48:35,334
l bet your balls smell
just like apple fritters, right?

429
00:48:35,545 --> 00:48:38,742
Wouldn't know. l don't keep
my money in my underpants.

430
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:42,407
Well, you would
if you did what l do.

431
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:45,179
l know girls that keep their money
inside their cooters.

432
00:48:46,323 --> 00:48:48,188
-l guess it's safekeeping.
-Jesus Christ.

433
00:48:48,392 --> 00:48:50,189
What's your problem?

434
00:48:50,694 --> 00:48:53,162
l don't know.
l guess l'm just not used...

435
00:48:53,363 --> 00:48:58,130
...to being around young women
who talk about their...

436
00:48:58,335 --> 00:48:59,324
...private parts.

437
00:49:03,407 --> 00:49:05,534
Like, hello.
Like, l have private parts.

438
00:49:16,153 --> 00:49:18,314
Wait till you see your house.

439
00:50:44,007 --> 00:50:48,740
<i>All right, top of the sheet</i>
<i>matches the top of the bed.</i>

440
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:55,648
See? Level right here.

441
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:58,685
-Now straighten it out.
-Looks good to me.

442
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:01,153
-Both sides even?
-Yeah.

443
00:51:02,025 --> 00:51:04,755
They do, huh? This side's too long.

444
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:08,955
Nope. They're both too long.

445
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:10,929
Does it make
that much of a difference?

446
00:51:11,134 --> 00:51:12,396
Yes.

447
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:15,196
All right, now tuck it in. Over here.

448
00:51:15,806 --> 00:51:16,864
Under.

449
00:51:17,774 --> 00:51:19,241
Tight.

450
00:51:22,446 --> 00:51:25,472
Okay. Now...

451
00:51:25,682 --> 00:51:29,584
...this is the tough part.
All right, now, come here.

452
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:34,856
Forty-five degree angle.

453
00:51:36,693 --> 00:51:39,992
Forty-five degree--
Where do you get this shit?

454
00:51:40,197 --> 00:51:43,030
What, nobody taught you
how to make a bed before?

455
00:51:43,233 --> 00:51:48,261
There. See? Nice and tight.
Tuck here.

456
00:51:48,905 --> 00:51:52,534
Put your hand here. All right?

457
00:51:53,743 --> 00:51:55,438
l'm not some kind of fucking idiot...

458
00:51:55,645 --> 00:51:58,113
...who, like, doesn't know
how to make a bed.

459
00:51:59,749 --> 00:52:02,343
l didn't mean to imply that.

460
00:52:05,555 --> 00:52:08,820
-Okay.
-Now, you tuck it here. Tuck it under.

461
00:52:09,025 --> 00:52:11,755
Well, then maybe you shouldn't
say shit like that...

462
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:15,591
...and think that l should know shit
that l haven't figured out yet.

463
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:16,925
Okay.

464
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:19,864
Okay. l'm sorry.

465
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:26,666
All right?

466
00:52:32,516 --> 00:52:33,983
Okay?

467
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:37,714
Yeah. Okay.

468
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:22,257
Where you headed?

469
00:53:23,233 --> 00:53:25,098
New Orleans.

470
00:53:26,503 --> 00:53:29,961
l like New Orleans.
lt's a very special place.

471
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:33,768
-ls it?
-Yeah.

472
00:53:33,977 --> 00:53:36,138
l like about anywhere.

473
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:38,374
Except Vegas.

474
00:53:38,582 --> 00:53:41,176
l don't like places invented
to hold you upside down...

475
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:43,978
...and shake all the money
out of your pockets.

476
00:53:44,854 --> 00:53:48,051
Name's Roger. What's yours?

477
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:52,517
-Lois.
-You married to Superman, Lois?

478
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:57,928
But you are married, right?

479
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:01,469
Thirty years next June.

480
00:54:01,671 --> 00:54:04,868
You are too young
to be married that long.

481
00:54:06,776 --> 00:54:08,835
Am l bothering you?

482
00:54:10,513 --> 00:54:13,971
-l'm just not used to--
-Not used to talking to strangers.

483
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:18,054
That's all l do. Talk to strangers.

484
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:20,086
Comes with the job.

485
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:30,023
You got kids?

486
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:32,458
No.

487
00:54:34,738 --> 00:54:37,366
-Do you?
-Nope.

488
00:54:43,146 --> 00:54:45,671
Think l might be able
to buy you a drink?

489
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:50,886
l don't think they serve liquor here.

490
00:54:51,087 --> 00:54:55,922
No. There's a bar up the road a piece.
Nice place. Real clean.

491
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,390
No. l....

492
00:54:59,195 --> 00:55:01,129
lt's okay.
l bet you get tired of guys...

493
00:55:01,331 --> 00:55:03,231
...always trying to get personal
with you.

494
00:55:04,267 --> 00:55:07,100
No, l wouldn't say that, exactly.

495
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:13,909
lt's been a long time since...

496
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,641
...anything.

497
00:55:18,848 --> 00:55:19,974
Everything.

498
00:55:23,286 --> 00:55:24,753
lt's nice of you to ask me.

499
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:29,853
l'm very flattered. l mean that.

500
00:55:32,529 --> 00:55:35,259
-Oh, l....
-Better hit the road.

501
00:55:35,465 --> 00:55:38,366
Yeah, me too.
lt was nice talking to you, Lois.

502
00:55:38,868 --> 00:55:41,132
Nice talking to you too.

503
00:55:48,445 --> 00:55:49,935
-Josh?
-No way.

504
00:55:50,146 --> 00:55:52,239
lt's robot love.

505
00:56:13,803 --> 00:56:17,295
-Hello?
-<i>Doug, l just got ripped off.</i>

506
00:56:17,841 --> 00:56:20,036
-What?
-<i>All my fucking money is gone...</i>

507
00:56:20,243 --> 00:56:22,939
<i>...and l'm gonna fucking kill</i>
<i>this guy.</i>

508
00:56:23,513 --> 00:56:25,310
All right. Calm down.
Where are you?

509
00:56:25,515 --> 00:56:27,847
<i>l'm at the Aloha Motel.</i>
<i>You don't know where it is.</i>

510
00:56:35,692 --> 00:56:36,818
You all right?

511
00:56:37,861 --> 00:56:40,455
l can't stand on the street
without the cops coming by...

512
00:56:40,663 --> 00:56:42,756
-...like l'm a crack whore.
-What happened?

513
00:56:42,966 --> 00:56:47,460
l came here with this guy, and he kept
trying to stick it in my fucking ass.

514
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:51,333
And l was like, ''Yo, pencil dick,
back the fuck up.''

515
00:56:51,541 --> 00:56:53,975
And he wouldn't.
l went to piss. l came back out...

516
00:56:54,177 --> 00:56:57,169
...and my wallet's on the bed,
and all my shit is everywhere...

517
00:56:57,380 --> 00:57:01,476
...and his car's gone, and all l've got
is fucking shoes, and, like....

518
00:57:01,684 --> 00:57:04,847
-l'm out 900 bucks.
-Nine hundred dollars?

519
00:57:05,789 --> 00:57:08,883
Why in the hell would you carry
that much money around with you?

520
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:10,525
Where else am l gonna keep it?

521
00:57:10,727 --> 00:57:12,456
l don't know. ln the bank?

522
00:57:12,662 --> 00:57:15,688
What? l don't have
a fucking bank account. What?

523
00:57:15,899 --> 00:57:18,390
This fucking asshole
won't give me the guy's address...

524
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:20,865
...because he's fucking friends
with him!

525
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:22,799
-Hey. Hey.
-l'm gonna fucking kill him!

526
00:57:23,006 --> 00:57:25,304
And what are you gonna do
with his address?

527
00:57:25,508 --> 00:57:27,635
l'm gonna go get my money back.

528
00:57:27,844 --> 00:57:31,371
No, you're not. You're either gonna
call the police, or you're gonna drop it.

529
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:33,813
l can't call the police, Doug.

530
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:37,181
Oh, don't be so fucking stupid.
Just help me.

531
00:57:37,387 --> 00:57:39,116
l'm stupid?

532
00:57:39,322 --> 00:57:42,223
You bring $900 to a place like this,
and l'm stupid?

533
00:57:43,326 --> 00:57:46,693
You come here
with assholes from that club.

534
00:57:46,896 --> 00:57:50,662
-That's stupid. That's really stupid.
-Okay, l'm really fucking stupid!

535
00:57:50,867 --> 00:57:53,233
-Where are you going?
-l'm gonna turn some tricks...

536
00:57:53,436 --> 00:57:55,563
-...and make my money back.
-No, you're not.

537
00:57:55,772 --> 00:57:56,932
Come on. We're going home.

538
00:57:59,576 --> 00:58:02,977
Then go ahead!
Go ahead, then, goddamn it!

539
00:58:07,183 --> 00:58:09,879
Okay. Okay.

540
00:58:11,688 --> 00:58:13,588
l mean, fucking....

541
00:58:15,758 --> 00:58:19,159

546
00:58:37,881 --> 00:58:40,941
l know. Baby, l know.

547
00:58:42,285 --> 00:58:44,276
You're gonna be okay.

548
00:58:45,321 --> 00:58:47,050
Look at me.

549
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:48,952
Come on.

550
00:58:49,158 --> 00:58:50,785
Come on.

551
00:58:50,994 --> 00:58:52,518
Let's go.

552
01:00:48,845 --> 01:00:50,369
You up yet?

553
01:00:50,913 --> 01:00:52,403
Go away.

554
01:00:52,915 --> 01:00:56,112
-You gonna sleep all day?
-Fuck off.

555
01:00:58,254 --> 01:00:59,380
Come on. Let's go.

556
01:01:09,399 --> 01:01:12,027
-What do you think you're doing?
-Going to the Laundromat.

557
01:01:12,235 --> 01:01:15,136
-What the fuck time is it?
-Two fifteen in the afternoon.

558
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:17,306
Come on. Let's get moving.

559
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:23,611
-What are you doing?
-Laundry.

560
01:01:23,813 --> 01:01:26,941
You wanna do laundry?
Here. Wash my laundry for me.

561
01:01:28,885 --> 01:01:30,375
You break my heart.

562
01:01:30,586 --> 01:01:33,487
Why? Because you wanna fuck me,
and you can't?

563
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:52,766
Come on.
We're going to the Laundromat.

564
01:01:54,777 --> 01:01:57,575
-Let's go.
-You gonna give me my money today?

565
01:01:58,815 --> 01:02:00,680
-Put your clothes on.
-Give me my money...

566
01:02:00,883 --> 01:02:03,351
...or get the fuck out of my house!

567
01:02:08,958 --> 01:02:11,950
Here. Here's your money.

568
01:02:15,665 --> 01:02:18,065
You know what?
You wanna parade around here...

569
01:02:18,267 --> 01:02:21,430
...in your birthday suit, if displaying
your vagina's the only way...

570
01:02:21,637 --> 01:02:24,231
...you can feel in control,
well, you knock yourself out.

571
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:27,204
But l'm tired of your language,
especially the word ''fuck''...

572
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:30,641
...and all its various permutations.
l know it's your only adjective...

573
01:02:30,847 --> 01:02:34,578
...but it makes you sound cheap
and immature and uneducated.

574
01:02:34,784 --> 01:02:37,776
And that may be the truth,
but why advertise it?

575
01:02:37,987 --> 01:02:42,117
Now, starting today, l'm docking you
a dollar every time you use that word.

576
01:02:42,325 --> 01:02:47,160
So get up, get dressed,
get in the shower, brush your teeth.

577
01:02:47,363 --> 01:02:50,992
Let's go. Let's go.

578
01:02:51,701 --> 01:02:52,725
Let's go.

579
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:39,774
Don't be mad at me.

580
01:03:44,053 --> 01:03:47,079
l mean, l don't like being told
what to do. l can't help it.

581
01:03:49,725 --> 01:03:53,388
And l'll lay off the curse words.
l will. l promise. Okay?

582
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:59,100
Goddamn it, Doug, please,
don't be mad at me.

583
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:02,297
-l'm not mad at you.
-You're acting like you're mad at me.

584
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:05,201
No, l'm not acting like
l'm mad at you.

585
01:04:05,408 --> 01:04:07,103
Now, sit down.

586
01:04:09,946 --> 01:04:11,937
Take it easy.

587
01:04:21,457 --> 01:04:23,118
Come here.

588
01:04:23,326 --> 01:04:25,294
Come here. Come on.

589
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:39,303
Fuck.

590
01:04:43,813 --> 01:04:47,749
Just don't be mad at me. You can't.

591
01:05:06,535 --> 01:05:08,332
Hello?

592
01:05:08,537 --> 01:05:10,232
<i>lt's me.</i>

593
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:12,705
Hey.

l called you last night.

595
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:20,378
You must've gone to bed.

596
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:22,676
-Did you get my message?
-<i>l'm here.</i>

597
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:27,018
Well, like l said last night,

598
01:05:27,223 --> 01:05:29,282
<i>l'm here.</i>

599
01:05:30,726 --> 01:05:33,058
Well, l know you are,
and l appreciate it.

600
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:37,062
Damn it, Doug, l'm here,
in New Orleans.

601
01:05:38,334 --> 01:05:41,269
<i>l was supposed to get off</i>
<i>on Basin Street...</i>

602
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:44,633
<i>...and somehow l got on Royal...</i>

603
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:47,809
...and l've run out of directions now.

604
01:05:49,078 --> 01:05:53,037
-You're in New Orleans?
-Yes. l drove down.

605
01:05:53,516 --> 01:05:54,744
You drove down?

606
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:57,511
-You know l don't like airplanes.
-<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

607
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:00,086
-<i>You drove down from lndianapolis?</i>
-Yes.

608
01:06:02,058 --> 01:06:04,526
-By yourself?
-<i>Yes.</i>

609
01:06:04,727 --> 01:06:09,687
You're not gonna be happy
when you see your car, but l'm here.

610
01:06:10,366 --> 01:06:12,197
Where did you say you are?

611
01:06:12,401 --> 01:06:15,097
<i>Yeah, Royal and</i>-- <i>Hold on.</i>

612
01:06:20,209 --> 01:06:21,267
--Orleans.

613
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:22,569
<i>Royal and Orleans.</i>

614
01:06:23,612 --> 01:06:25,876

Stay right there,

<i>Great.</i>

617
01:06:56,345 --> 01:06:58,836
Excuse me. Can you tell me
where Royal and Orleans is?

618
01:06:59,048 --> 01:07:02,313
Two blocks past Jackson Square
there, make a right, and up two blocks.

619
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:05,544
All right. That's my car there.
Here are the keys. l'll be back.

620
01:07:05,755 --> 01:07:07,916
You park there,
you'll get towed real quick.

621
01:07:08,124 --> 01:07:10,285
Well, then tow it. lt's a rental.

622
01:07:21,437 --> 01:07:24,167
Excuse me. Sorry.

623
01:08:00,776 --> 01:08:02,676
Surprise.

624

l'd have left a lot sooner...

625
01:08:18,627 --> 01:08:21,391
...if l'd have known it would've gotten
you out of the house.

626
01:08:21,597 --> 01:08:24,031
l'm not even on my pills,
if you can believe that.

627
01:08:25,434 --> 01:08:26,799
You feel all right?

628
01:08:27,369 --> 01:08:29,360
Feel all right.

629
01:08:31,507 --> 01:08:36,171
Haven't seen you in the daylight
in a long time, you know.

630
01:08:36,679 --> 01:08:38,078
You look beautiful.

631
01:08:41,717 --> 01:08:44,550
So good to see you.

632
01:08:53,529 --> 01:08:57,056
You want a drink,
or something to eat, or...?

633
01:08:57,266 --> 01:09:00,394
A place l could freshen up
a little first?

634
01:09:02,037 --> 01:09:05,268
Your hotel or something?

635
01:09:06,609 --> 01:09:10,238
Well, l guess there's someone
that l want you to meet...

636
01:09:12,348 --> 01:09:14,543
...first. Okay?

637
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:15,876
Well, okay.

638
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:20,587
-Where's the car?
-lt's over there. Got a ticket.

639
01:09:21,891 --> 01:09:23,017
Damn.

640
01:09:23,225 --> 01:09:25,284
-Well, that's all right. l got towed.
-What?

641
01:09:25,494 --> 01:09:27,860
l did. l left it on the corner
up on the sidewalk...

642
01:09:28,063 --> 01:09:30,691
...trying to come and get you
over there.

643
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:53,511
-How are you?
-l'm okay.

644
01:10:08,304 --> 01:10:10,169
Here we are.

645
01:10:16,478 --> 01:10:19,914
-That's quite a shade of green.
-Not that one.

646
01:10:20,783 --> 01:10:22,341
That one.

647
01:10:22,918 --> 01:10:25,944
Oh, you can't be serious.

648
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:29,020
Come on inside.

649
01:10:30,859 --> 01:10:33,293
The person you want me to meet
lives in here?

650
01:10:33,529 --> 01:10:38,831
Her name is Mallory.
Now, her real name is Allison.

651
01:10:39,034 --> 01:10:41,969
She's got a lot of names
because she works in a strip club.

652
01:10:42,171 --> 01:10:44,230
She's a stripper?

653
01:10:45,641 --> 01:10:47,438
You'll understand
once you meet her.

654
01:10:47,643 --> 01:10:51,170
Understand what? That you've lost
your mind? Jesus, Doug.

655
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:55,783
Lois, just come inside. Lois--

656
01:10:56,285 --> 01:10:57,479
-Hey.
-Hey.

657
01:10:58,554 --> 01:11:00,317
Where'd you go running off to?

658
01:11:00,522 --> 01:11:05,653
Well, Mallory, this is my wife, Lois.
Lois, Mallory.

659
01:11:09,531 --> 01:11:11,294
Hey. How you doing?

660
01:11:13,669 --> 01:11:15,068
Lois.

661
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:18,035
Hey, Doug, Tara's gonna give me
a ride home from work...

662
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:21,368
...so you don't have to--
And l'm going early, so....

663
01:11:21,577 --> 01:11:22,874
-Lois, hold up.
-No.

664
01:11:23,078 --> 01:11:25,979
Hold up. Lois. Hold up.

665
01:11:26,181 --> 01:11:28,274
-Come on. Come here.
-No. No. You're crazy.

666
01:11:28,484 --> 01:11:31,851
-All right. Calm down. Calm down.
-This is insane. She's just a child.

667
01:11:32,054 --> 01:11:36,548
She is a 1 6-year-old runaway
from Florida, okay?

668
01:11:36,759 --> 01:11:40,456
-All right?
-What do you think you are doing?

669
01:11:40,663 --> 01:11:45,191
l don't know. That's what
l'm trying to tell you. Okay?

670
01:11:46,669 --> 01:11:50,298
-No, no, no. This is a nightmare.
-Lois. Lois. Lois.

671
01:11:50,506 --> 01:11:54,067
Just calm down and talk to me.

672
01:11:54,276 --> 01:11:58,007
-Doug, let go of me. Let--
-All right. All right.

673
01:11:58,213 --> 01:12:00,044
-Calm down.
-l-- No.

674
01:12:00,249 --> 01:12:03,412
l have made a terrible mistake.

675
01:12:06,955 --> 01:12:08,582
All right.

676
01:12:08,791 --> 01:12:10,759
Maybe you have.

677
01:12:12,061 --> 01:12:13,619
Take the keys...

678
01:12:13,829 --> 01:12:15,490
...drive down to lndianapolis...

679
01:12:15,698 --> 01:12:19,293
...and lock yourself up
in your goddamn house again.

680
01:13:26,335 --> 01:13:28,769
-<i>So it's your job to take care of her?</i>
-<i>Why not?</i>

681
01:13:28,971 --> 01:13:33,965
No. For heaven's sake, Doug,
she's not a stray cat, she's a child.

682
01:13:34,176 --> 01:13:36,644
Got no one else to take care of.

683
01:13:37,546 --> 01:13:39,605
What about me?

684
01:13:44,553 --> 01:13:48,717
-Want another beer?
-l said, what about me?

685
01:13:48,924 --> 01:13:51,051
l'm your wife, damn it.

686
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:54,195
You don't just walk away
after 30 years.

687
01:13:54,396 --> 01:13:56,023
You don't just call one day and say:

688
01:13:56,231 --> 01:13:58,529
''Oh, by the way,
l'm not coming home.''

689
01:13:58,734 --> 01:14:02,500
No. That's not the way it works.

690
01:14:03,172 --> 01:14:06,039
You tell me what you want, Doug.

691
01:14:06,708 --> 01:14:08,369
l don't know.

692
01:14:09,678 --> 01:14:12,408
You wanna run away?

693
01:14:12,614 --> 01:14:14,548
You wanna hide?

694
01:14:15,184 --> 01:14:16,583
Maybe.

695
01:14:16,785 --> 01:14:21,518
You wanna pretend some
runaway stripper is your daughter?

696
01:14:40,542 --> 01:14:42,669
What time is it?

697
01:14:46,715 --> 01:14:50,116
l'm selling Circle City.

698
01:14:55,290 --> 01:14:58,418
This fella from New Orleans...

699
01:14:58,627 --> 01:15:02,085
...wants to show me a written offer.

700
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:04,231
He's over at the Omni Royal Hotel...

701
01:15:04,433 --> 01:15:08,460
...and l'm supposed to meet him
in the lobby in a half-hour.

702
01:15:11,807 --> 01:15:13,775
l'll get you a room there.

703
01:15:13,976 --> 01:15:15,944
lt's a nice place.

704
01:15:19,414 --> 01:15:21,473
Where are you staying?

705
01:15:22,651 --> 01:15:24,312
Here.

706
01:15:25,487 --> 01:15:26,818
With Mallory.

707
01:15:29,291 --> 01:15:31,623
l'll stay here too, then.

708
01:15:34,029 --> 01:15:36,793
You can leave me if you have to...

709
01:15:36,999 --> 01:15:39,593
...but l will never leave you.

710
01:15:40,836 --> 01:15:45,603
So you just do
what you have to do here, huh?

711
01:16:27,215 --> 01:16:29,445
Hey. Sorry.
l didn't mean to wake you up.

712
01:16:30,752 --> 01:16:33,016
That's all right. lt's been a long day.

713
01:16:34,156 --> 01:16:37,557
-Where's Doug?
-He'll be back in a little while.

714
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:40,017
Okay.

715
01:16:50,839 --> 01:16:52,807
Are you hungry?

716
01:16:58,080 --> 01:16:59,672
Yeah.

717
01:17:00,782 --> 01:17:02,306
l got off early tonight.

718
01:17:02,851 --> 01:17:04,216
Business sucks.

719
01:17:09,091 --> 01:17:11,321
You wanna go around the corner
and get a po'boy?

720
01:17:12,427 --> 01:17:13,655
What's a po'boy?

721
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:15,729
lt's like a sandwich.

722
01:17:18,266 --> 01:17:19,824
All right.

723
01:17:26,108 --> 01:17:28,599
l figured he was married.

724
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:30,300
Did you?

725
01:17:32,781 --> 01:17:35,511
He doesn't like being alone,
you know?

726
01:17:35,717 --> 01:17:36,706
l know.

727
01:17:42,157 --> 01:17:44,091
Hey, you know, me and Doug...

728
01:17:46,628 --> 01:17:49,461
...like, we don't fool around
or anything like that.

729
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:52,099
l'm just saying,
l mean, like, nothing like that.

730
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:54,063
-lt's just--
-l believe you.

731
01:17:54,503 --> 01:17:56,937
Because, like,
he's completely old-school. lt's crazy.

732
01:17:57,139 --> 01:18:00,131
-l believe you.
-He even fines me, like, a dollar...

733
01:18:00,342 --> 01:18:02,276
...if l say the word ''fuck.''

734
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:07,478
Can you not tell him that too?
Because l think that he'd--

735
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:09,913
Fine you a dollar.

736
01:18:10,152 --> 01:18:12,746
-Yeah.
-l won't tell him.

737
01:18:22,130 --> 01:18:24,223
How long you guys been married?

738
01:18:25,133 --> 01:18:27,795
Thirty years next June.

739
01:18:32,374 --> 01:18:34,672
That's basically forever.

740
01:18:39,915 --> 01:18:41,780
Got any kids?

741
01:18:43,885 --> 01:18:46,353
We had a daughter.

742
01:18:47,489 --> 01:18:49,320
She died in a car accident.

743
01:18:52,394 --> 01:18:54,487
My mom died in a car accident.

744
01:18:56,631 --> 01:18:59,429
l was in the car accident as well.

745
01:18:59,634 --> 01:19:01,261
How old were you?

746
01:19:02,337 --> 01:19:07,206
Four. Or 5. l don't really--
l mean, l don't remember it.

747
01:19:08,744 --> 01:19:10,336
Which is good.

748
01:19:10,545 --> 01:19:12,638
lt would be kind of fucked up
to remember that.

749
01:19:15,851 --> 01:19:19,150
-What was your daughter's name?
-Emily.

750
01:19:19,755 --> 01:19:22,053
Emily Eugenia Riley.

751
01:19:23,892 --> 01:19:26,622
-How old was she?
-Fifteen.

752
01:19:29,030 --> 01:19:30,019
That sucks.

753
01:19:32,334 --> 01:19:33,858
Yes.

754
01:19:35,237 --> 01:19:37,171
lt does.

755
01:20:13,375 --> 01:20:15,002
Night owl.

756
01:20:21,683 --> 01:20:25,084
lt's just so unusual to be outside.

757
01:20:26,087 --> 01:20:28,055
Yeah, l'll bet.

758
01:20:31,459 --> 01:20:33,825
Had dinner with Allison.

759
01:20:36,631 --> 01:20:38,531
You did?

760
01:20:39,634 --> 01:20:41,033
She home?

761
01:20:41,236 --> 01:20:43,227
Went on a date.

762
01:20:55,984 --> 01:20:57,611
Come in.

763
01:21:07,229 --> 01:21:10,096
Did you bring
your migraine medicine?

764
01:21:11,099 --> 01:21:12,293
No. Why?

765
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:15,731
Because you need to take one of those
pills before we make love...

766
01:21:15,937 --> 01:21:18,804
...or you're going to get a headache.

767
01:21:19,007 --> 01:21:21,441
l haven't had a headache
in a long time.

768
01:21:22,844 --> 01:21:24,311
l know.

769
01:21:28,750 --> 01:21:30,911
We haven't made love...

770
01:21:32,587 --> 01:21:34,555
...in a long time.

771
01:22:48,496 --> 01:22:51,397
Allison? Can l come in?

772
01:22:51,933 --> 01:22:53,457
Yeah.

773
01:22:54,869 --> 01:22:57,531
Sweetie, what's wrong?

774
01:22:59,908 --> 01:23:01,967
l don't know.

775
01:23:02,177 --> 01:23:03,610
There's something....

776
01:23:03,812 --> 01:23:06,178
There's something really wrong
with my cooter.

777
01:23:06,381 --> 01:23:10,112
-Your cooter?
-My pussy.

778
01:23:10,852 --> 01:23:11,841
Did you pee?

779
01:23:13,955 --> 01:23:15,684
-Does it burn when you pee?
-Yes.

780
01:23:15,890 --> 01:23:19,621
Okay. All right.
Okay. Okay. l'll be right back.

781
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:21,420
l'm gonna get something for you.

782
01:23:22,731 --> 01:23:24,562
Doug, honey.

783
01:23:24,766 --> 01:23:26,393
Wake up.

784
01:23:27,402 --> 01:23:28,664
Doug.

785
01:23:28,870 --> 01:23:31,338
l need you to go to the drug store.

786
01:23:32,307 --> 01:23:36,209
-You all right?
-l'm fine. lt's Allison.

787
01:23:36,411 --> 01:23:37,708
What's wrong with her?

788
01:23:37,912 --> 01:23:40,779
Just female trouble.
Come on. Get up.

789
01:23:42,384 --> 01:23:44,852
Let's get you in the shower.

790
01:24:00,702 --> 01:24:01,999
lt's just me.

791
01:24:03,405 --> 01:24:05,134
Come on out.

792
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:07,706
Let's get you dried off.

793
01:24:08,777 --> 01:24:11,644
Come on. That's it.

794
01:24:11,846 --> 01:24:14,713
Come on. That's it.

795
01:24:14,916 --> 01:24:16,577
Sit down.

796
01:24:19,154 --> 01:24:21,554
-Oh, fuck.
-You have a pair of clean...

797
01:24:21,756 --> 01:24:23,986
...white cotton undies?

798
01:24:24,826 --> 01:24:26,157
No.

799
01:24:27,095 --> 01:24:30,189
Well, then you don't need
to wear any.

800
01:24:30,398 --> 01:24:32,662
Oh, God.

801
01:24:32,867 --> 01:24:35,802
Just put you in a clean nightgown.

802
01:24:36,004 --> 01:24:37,699
l don't have a nightgown.

803
01:24:37,906 --> 01:24:39,498
You can borrow one of mine.

804
01:24:50,852 --> 01:24:52,649
Excuse me.

805
01:24:52,854 --> 01:24:55,379
Excuse me, ma'am?
Your daughter wants you.

806
01:24:55,590 --> 01:24:57,387
-What?
-ln the dressing room back there.

807
01:24:57,592 --> 01:24:59,287
Your daughter needs you.

808
01:24:59,494 --> 01:25:01,462
Thank you.

809
01:25:01,663 --> 01:25:04,496
-Thank you very much.
-No problem.

810
01:25:08,803 --> 01:25:11,795
-Allison?
-Yeah, l'm in here.

811
01:25:20,415 --> 01:25:23,316
-This is so not jiggy.
-lt fits well.

812
01:25:23,518 --> 01:25:28,012
Oh, you just have to adjust
these straps.

813
01:25:31,693 --> 01:25:33,718
There we go.

814
01:25:34,262 --> 01:25:36,389
Bet you were a good mom.

815
01:25:47,242 --> 01:25:49,073
l-- That was stupid.

816
01:25:49,277 --> 01:25:52,804
No. No, sweetie. l just...

817
01:25:53,414 --> 01:25:54,881
...think of things sometimes.

818
01:25:55,950 --> 01:25:57,577
What things?

819
01:26:00,755 --> 01:26:02,848
l went after her.

820
01:26:03,892 --> 01:26:06,087
l didn't tell that part...

821
01:26:07,228 --> 01:26:09,753
...about how Emily died.

822
01:26:15,069 --> 01:26:16,866
Tell me what?

823
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:19,971
l was awake that night.

824
01:26:21,910 --> 01:26:27,212
Doug was at his poker game.
l always stay up till he gets home.

825
01:26:28,550 --> 01:26:31,110
l heard something.
Went to the window.

826
01:26:31,319 --> 01:26:34,516
Saw Emily get into
her boyfriend's car.

827
01:26:36,925 --> 01:26:40,361
So l put on some clothes...

828
01:26:40,562 --> 01:26:45,363
...and got into my car
and went looking for them.

829
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:47,399
Did you find them?

830
01:26:48,269 --> 01:26:51,363
Parked in a shopping center
not far from our house.

831
01:26:52,006 --> 01:26:54,167
l'm sure they were really happy
to see you.

832
01:26:55,009 --> 01:26:57,204
He took off.

833
01:26:57,912 --> 01:27:00,142
l tried to catch up.

834
01:27:00,348 --> 01:27:04,114
l couldn't. He was driving so fast.

835
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:09,618
Lost them for a little while,
and then....

836
01:27:15,797 --> 01:27:17,731
They crashed the car?

837
01:27:19,334 --> 01:27:23,327
Ran a stop sign
and hit a truck broadside.

838
01:27:23,538 --> 01:27:26,905
By the time l got there,
everything was on fire.

839
01:27:27,108 --> 01:27:29,133
Couldn't get to them.

840
01:27:31,646 --> 01:27:35,013
Wouldn't have happened
if l hadn't gone after her.

841
01:27:40,588 --> 01:27:43,284
You get changed.
We'll go meet Doug.

842
01:27:50,531 --> 01:27:51,896
Hey.

843
01:27:54,035 --> 01:27:56,299
lt's not your fault.
That's not your fault.

844
01:27:58,072 --> 01:28:03,476
Just like, l mean, my mom getting in
a car accident's not my fault.

845
01:28:09,917 --> 01:28:13,216
Your mother must have been
very pretty.

846
01:28:15,690 --> 01:28:17,282
Yeah.

847
01:28:19,861 --> 01:28:22,125
She had bigger tits than me.

848
01:28:22,330 --> 01:28:24,958
l got my dad's tits.
l don't know what happened.

849
01:28:25,166 --> 01:28:27,726
l got my dad's too.

850
01:28:30,638 --> 01:28:32,037
See you out there.

851
01:28:53,328 --> 01:28:56,058
l said get white ones...

852
01:28:58,232 --> 01:29:00,359
...but she likes them.

853
01:29:07,542 --> 01:29:09,737
-Watch out.
-Sorry.

854
01:29:12,113 --> 01:29:14,138
Can l take a shower yet?

855
01:29:14,349 --> 01:29:15,714
Nope.

856
01:29:15,917 --> 01:29:19,409
Thermocouple's screwy,
and the pilot keeps going out.

857
01:29:23,091 --> 01:29:26,185
-Why'd you dump Lois?
-Goddamn it!

858
01:29:27,762 --> 01:29:30,697
-l didn't dump her.
-You've been living here with me.

859
01:29:30,898 --> 01:29:33,833
-What's up with that?
-l don't know.

860
01:29:34,035 --> 01:29:35,764
You think it's all her fault?

861
01:29:37,438 --> 01:29:38,427
What?

862
01:29:40,341 --> 01:29:42,707
Your daughter in the car crash?

863
01:29:44,779 --> 01:29:46,337
She told you about that?

864
01:29:46,547 --> 01:29:49,345
Yeah. ls that, like,
a secret or something?

865
01:29:51,285 --> 01:29:53,253
Give me my lighter back.

866
01:29:54,088 --> 01:29:57,683
Because it would really suck shit
if you blamed her for that.

867
01:29:59,260 --> 01:30:02,354
l don't blame her.
What are you talking about?

868
01:30:02,563 --> 01:30:06,294
-l mean, she was being a good mom.
-Who said she wasn't?

869
01:30:07,301 --> 01:30:09,360
So you don't think
it's all her fault, then?

870
01:30:09,570 --> 01:30:13,131
No. l don't know. We don't talk
about it. Give me my lighter back.

871
01:30:16,511 --> 01:30:18,342
You should talk about it.

872
01:30:39,867 --> 01:30:41,801
-l'll see you later.
-Where are you going?

873
01:30:42,003 --> 01:30:43,436
Club.

874
01:30:44,172 --> 01:30:48,700
Don't you think you should take a few
nights off until your, you know...?

875
01:30:48,910 --> 01:30:51,640
l got my cranberry juice.
l'm good to go.

876
01:30:59,220 --> 01:31:03,623
Allison, l don't think
you should do this anymore.

877
01:31:07,228 --> 01:31:10,163
-Do what?
-You know what l'm talking about.

878
01:31:10,832 --> 01:31:12,197
You don't work, you don't eat.

879
01:31:15,269 --> 01:31:16,668
Wait.

880
01:31:18,439 --> 01:31:21,408
-l can't let you do this.
-Lois, don't.

881
01:31:21,609 --> 01:31:23,008
-What?
-Don't be stupid.

882
01:31:23,211 --> 01:31:25,475
l apologize
for being so unsophisticated...

883
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:30,049
...but l cannot let a 1 6-year-old girl
prostitute herself.

884
01:31:30,251 --> 01:31:32,515
-l'm a fucking dancer.
-And a prostitute.

885
01:31:34,288 --> 01:31:37,587
Well, you're not my fucking mom,
so get the fuck out of my way.

886
01:31:37,792 --> 01:31:40,022
-No, Allison--
-All right, don't fucking touch me.

887
01:31:40,228 --> 01:31:41,957
All right. Listen to me, though.

888
01:31:42,163 --> 01:31:44,256
-Please listen.
-l don't have to listen to you.

889
01:31:44,465 --> 01:31:47,161
-You're not my fucking mom.
-Doug, never mind.

890
01:31:47,368 --> 01:31:49,495
This is my fucking house.
Just get the fuck--

891
01:31:49,704 --> 01:31:52,730
You don't know what you're doing
to yourself, sweetheart.

892
01:31:52,940 --> 01:31:54,669
-Don't.
-Please, Doug.

893
01:31:54,876 --> 01:31:57,902
And l know more about what l do
than you will ever know.

894
01:31:59,046 --> 01:32:01,139
-How many cocks you swallowed?
-Hey.

895
01:32:03,017 --> 01:32:05,383
-All right. All right. All right.
-Fuck! Fuck!

896
01:32:05,586 --> 01:32:08,384
-My fucking-- Fuck you!
-Take it easy. She didn't mean it.

897
01:32:08,589 --> 01:32:11,615
-Okay, just stop fucking touching me!
-Calm down.

898
01:32:11,826 --> 01:32:14,659
-She didn't mean it. All right?
-Get the fuck off me!

899
01:32:14,862 --> 01:32:18,025
-l'm sorry. Allison. Allison.
-lt's okay.

900
01:32:18,232 --> 01:32:19,494
Let her go, Doug.

901
01:32:19,700 --> 01:32:21,793
-Doug, let her go!
-l just wanna talk to her!

902
01:32:22,003 --> 01:32:25,495
-Mallory!
-Doug, let her go.

903
01:32:57,338 --> 01:32:59,670
There's a train to Chicago
in the morning.

904
01:32:59,874 --> 01:33:02,104
l can take a bus from there
to lndianapolis.

905
01:33:28,502 --> 01:33:30,265
We're out of beer.

906
01:33:30,471 --> 01:33:32,666
l'll be back in a little while.

907
01:34:33,134 --> 01:34:34,761
Hello?

908
01:34:36,404 --> 01:34:37,962
What?

909
01:34:41,142 --> 01:34:42,871
Where are you?

910
01:34:45,246 --> 01:34:47,339
All right. l'll be right there.

911
01:34:47,548 --> 01:34:49,607
What name are you under?

912
01:34:51,385 --> 01:34:53,012
What?

913
01:34:53,220 --> 01:34:55,245
All right. All right.

914
01:35:09,103 --> 01:35:10,593
Sit down.

915
01:35:12,039 --> 01:35:14,633
-You wanna know what she did?
-Yeah.

916
01:35:14,842 --> 01:35:18,608
She had an altercation
with an unsatisfied customer. He....

917
01:35:19,246 --> 01:35:21,771
He's dropped the charges,
and they've shaved down...

918
01:35:21,982 --> 01:35:24,473
...the ''resisting arrest''
to ''disorderly conduct''...

919
01:35:24,685 --> 01:35:26,414
...so everybody gets off cheap.

920
01:35:34,395 --> 01:35:38,764
Here's your receipt and my card.
You're free to go.

921
01:35:41,202 --> 01:35:44,433
-Thank you.
-You're welcome. Thank you.

922
01:37:26,440 --> 01:37:29,170
-Goddamn it.
-Doug.

923
01:37:29,376 --> 01:37:32,607
Where you going?
Where you going?

924
01:37:33,180 --> 01:37:35,080
-Get back in the car.
-Doug.

925
01:37:35,282 --> 01:37:37,978
Goddamn it. What are you doing?

926
01:37:41,989 --> 01:37:43,286
l'm nobody's little girl.

927
01:37:45,993 --> 01:37:48,518
lt's too late for that shit.

928
01:38:07,414 --> 01:38:09,678
She's not Emily.

929
01:38:17,291 --> 01:38:19,316
l know that.

930
01:39:16,850 --> 01:39:19,444
-You leaving?
-Yeah. You...?

931
01:39:23,257 --> 01:39:24,349
You seen Mallory?

932
01:39:25,359 --> 01:39:27,259
No. l ain't seen her.

933
01:39:28,696 --> 01:39:31,494
-She got arrested last night.
-Yeah, l know. l was there.

934
01:39:31,699 --> 01:39:34,099
We got raided. They shut us down.

935
01:39:34,301 --> 01:39:38,237
l bailed her out, but she ran off.

936
01:39:38,806 --> 01:39:41,104
l haven't seen her.
l don't know where she went.

937
01:39:51,485 --> 01:39:54,386
Give this to her for me.

938
01:39:57,524 --> 01:39:58,513
All right.

939
01:40:02,096 --> 01:40:03,688
Tell her...

940
01:40:10,704 --> 01:40:12,035
...she's got my number.

941
01:40:13,640 --> 01:40:14,698
Okay.

942
01:40:16,643 --> 01:40:18,543
-You take care.
-You too.

943
01:40:40,534 --> 01:40:41,899
Tara.

944
01:42:10,090 --> 01:42:12,820
Oh, it's a mess back there.

945
