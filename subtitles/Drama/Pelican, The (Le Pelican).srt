1
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,520
Any signs got my name on them?

2
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,920
Quite a few.

3
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,840
What do they say?

4
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,560
The usual.

5
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,880
"Death to Rosenberg."

6
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,880
"Retire Rosenberg."

7
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,440
"Cut off the oxygen."

8
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,800
That's my favorite.

9
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,200
Of course, you, Mr. Grantham..

10
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,200
did pretty good by me
your last time out.

11
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,520
"Rosenberg equals the
government over business.."

12
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,800
the individual over government,
the environment over everything..

13
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,760
"and the Indians, oh, give
them whatever they want."

14
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,680
With all due respect, that wasn't
my line, that was a quote.

15
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,560
From one of your unnamed
Senior White House officials.

16
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,440
Senior White House bastard,
you should have said.

17
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,040
Got in there by..

18
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,240
stirring up these people,
one against the other.

19
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,640
Never fails to amaze me..

20
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,400
what a man will do to
get an oval office.

21
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,200
Yes?

22
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,320
Looking for Mr. Sneller.
Mr. Sneller?

23
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,240
Yes, Mr. Edwin F. Sneller.

24
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,760
Hello. Everything is in place.

25
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,880
All the money must be there
when I arrive in Zurich.

26
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,960
It will be there if
the job is finished.

27
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,640
It will be finished.

28
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,800
May I help you? I'd like
to order room service.

29
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,800
- What would you like?
- Coffee..

30
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,320
scrambled eggs, whole-wheat
toast and orange juice, please.

31
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,320
It'll be about 15 minutes.
Thank you.

32
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,320
When we substitute
threat for an argument..

33
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,440
violence for principle,
we allow our passion..

34
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,520
to overcome our
capacity for reason.

35
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,560
Passion and self-interest
are threats to liberty..

36
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,320
which brings us to
Bowers against Hardwick.

37
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,720
A police officer entered Mr. Hardwick's
apartment to serve him a warrant..

38
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,080
for an unpaid violation
for drinking in public.

39
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,480
They caught him
with an open beer.

40
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,120
When he entered
Mr. Hardwick's bedroom..

41
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,640
he found him in bed with a man.

42
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,920
The officer arrested Hardwick..

43
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,960
for violating Georgia's
statute which outlaws sodomy.

44
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,680
Even though Georgia
dropped the case..

45
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,400
Hardwick challenged the
constitutionality of the statute.

46
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,960
Now, what was his claim?

47
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,120
- That it violates the
right of privacy. Why?

48
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,280
He's got the right to do
as he pleases in his home.

49
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,200
But what if he decided to sell drugs
at his home or engage in child abuse?

50
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,960
Those actions don't fit
within the right of privacy.

51
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,160
The court, beginning
with Griswold..

52
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,320
has limited the right of privacy
to actions which are intimate..

53
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,920
which are deeply personal, which
allow us to control our lives..

54
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,560
to define who we are.

55
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,600
But is that a constitutional claim?
There's no..

56
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,520
right to define oneself written
into the Constitution.

57
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,520
It's not even in the
Bill of Rights.

58
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,440
If the State of Georgia can
regulate Hardwick's sexuality..

59
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,760
engaged in private with consenting
adults, Hardwick cannot be free.

60
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,360
The Constitution ensures
limited government.

61
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,040
If there's no right of privacy and
Georgia can enforce the statute..

62
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,280
we sacrifice the liberty the framers
thought they'd guaranteed us.

63
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,840
The Supreme Court
disagreed with you.

64
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,760
They found that the statute did
not violate the right of privacy.

65
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,120
Why?

66
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,280
They're wrong.

67
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,520
So all three of you girls
find him irresistible. Why?

68
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,320
Sexual attraction.

69
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,800
You mean he's just got it?

70
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,400
Does he ever!

71
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,120
What you're saying..

72
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,800
is that if you could clone three
of him, you'd all be happy.

73
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,800
Okay, tell us, what
is your secret?

74
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,080
I'm not sure I can say on TV.

75
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,200
But what I can say is
it's a big secret.

76
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,360
A very big secret.

77
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,360
My goodness gracious! I
can't believe my ears!

78
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,160
Hope my mom's not watching.

79
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,760
She hopes so too!

80
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,480
Ma, I was just kidding.

81
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,280
Ladies, have you changed
your opinion about our stud?

82
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,280
You still like him?

83
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,840
I like big guys!

84
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,320
I think your fan
club has increased.

85
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,000
Everything has increased!

86
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,520
They found Rosenberg
around 1 A.M.

87
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,800
His nurse was also murdered.

88
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,760
Jensen was found two hours
later in some queer club.

89
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:18,400
Voyles called me, wildly upset. It's
hardly good for FBI's reputation.

90
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,600
He and Giminski are on the way.
Giminski?

91
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,400
Yes. The CIA should be
involved, at least for now.

92
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:28,440
You must wait two hours to address
the nation if we want an audience.

93
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,280
A coat and tie may seem a bit rehearsed.
How about a cardigan?

94
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,920
You want me to talk to the nation in
a time of crisis wearing a sweater?

95
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,280
Mr. President..

96
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,320
I've already told Justice to put
together a list of nominees.

97
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,920
Restructuring the court
will be your legacy.

98
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,000
Mr. President.

99
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,080
Mr. Voyles, does the
FBI have any suspects?

100
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,440
It's too soon.

101
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,120
We'll have ballistics
and autopsies later.

102
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:00,600
I would like to have a report on your
security and where it broke down.

103
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,200
You're assuming it broke down.

104
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:08,400
We have two dead judges, both of whom
were being protected by the FBI.

105
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,680
Bob, I'd like a straight answer.

106
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,240
Are these killings in any
way linked to the CIA..

107
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,400
or to any other agency of the
United States government?

108
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,320
I'm shocked you'd think that.

109
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,520
Bob, just look into it, okay?

110
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,320
I suggest we meet
back here at five.

111
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,800
Five, gentlemen. Thank you.

112
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,320
It's rally-around-the-leader
time.

113
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,280
Your approval ratings
will go through the roof.

114
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,920
That's the weather in New Orleans.
This is Tim Bellew.

115
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,760
We interrupt our program now
for a special bulletin.

116
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,000
In a special address, live
from the White House..

117
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,560
the president of
the United States.

118
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,520
My fellow Americans..

119
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,120
our country has suffered
a grievous loss.

120
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,960
Last night..

121
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:07,080
Supreme Court Justices
Rosenberg and Jensen..

122
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,920
were assassinated.

123
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:15,240
These assassinations may be an attempt
to strike at the very fabric..

124
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,040
of our government.

125
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,640
But I can assure each..

126
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,840
and every American..

127
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,800
that these dastardly acts
will not go unpunished.

128
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,600
Everything..

129
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:33,720
is being and will be done
to bring the culprit..

130
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,600
or culprits to justice.

131
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,160
For justice must..

132
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,520
and shall prevail.

133
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:46,400
I wish you could have known him
when I used to clerk for him.

134
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,200
Last time I saw him,
only the mind was left.

135
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,440
That's why they killed him.

136
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,600
That mind was still a threat.

137
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,880
But why kill him now, when
he had so little time left?

138
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,320
Maybe they couldn't take a chance
he'd last till the elections.

139
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,920
So why Jensen? This
president nominated him.

140
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,680
He and Rosenberg had
almost nothing in common.

141
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,080
That's what they
should look for.

142
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,480
Decisions on which
they both agreed.

143
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,480
Boy, if there ever was
a moment for a drink..

144
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,840
One day at a time, right?

145
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,120
We're talking a conspiracy,
then who are the conspirators?

146
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,640
If we've let foreign terrorists in,
there'll be hell to pay politically.

147
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:49,240
The intelligence community can't be
blamed for a weakness in immigration.

148
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,120
Denton, who are your suspects?

149
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,320
This has to be kept very quiet.

150
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,520
Of course. This is
the Oval Office.

151
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:04,640
At least 11 Underground Army members
have been in the D.C. area..

152
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:09,120
and we suspect them in at least 100
bombings of abortion clinics..

153
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,800
porno houses, gay clubs
all over the country.

154
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,520
The truth is, you
don't have a suspect.

155
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,520
Correct?

156
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,840
Watch your claws.

157
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,200
Gray Grantham covers the Supreme
Court for the Washington Herald.

158
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,880
You actually interviewed
Justice Rosenberg..

159
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,520
before he was shot on, as it
turned out, the day he died.

160
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,840
Did he say anything that might shed
some light on these dreadful events?

161
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,720
Yes. He spoke about things..

162
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:50,160
off the record, appropriately
for a sitting justice.

163
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,080
But I think it would be
appropriate to quote him now.

164
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,960
He said, "The campaign waged by
the president was so ruthless.."

165
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,720
in its manipulation of the
middle-class fears of minorities..

166
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:06,200
"had been so exploitive and divisive
that it created a climate of distrust."

167
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,480
You know, that Grantham's
a man after my own heart.

168
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,600
Everyone wants to know when
you're starting classes again.

169
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,400
That includes me.

170
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:21,000
You know what they say: Drinking
makes depression worse.

171
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,240
What do they recommend for anguish?
Where've you been?

172
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,640
The library. I studied a printout
of the Supreme Court docket.

173
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,320
I even made a list of
possible suspects.

174
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,680
And then threw it away because
they'd be obvious to everyone.

175
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:39,520
Then you looked for areas Jensen
and Rosenberg had in common.

176
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,760
Exactly.

177
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:45,160
Jensen generally protected the
rights of criminal defendants.

178
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,560
Some notable exceptions.

179
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,160
He wrote 3 majority opinions
protective of the environment.

180
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,440
And almost always
supported tax protestors.

181
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,160
So they might have been assassinated
by an insatiable tax collector?

182
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,840
As yet, I rule no one out.

183
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:03,360
Everyone is assuming the
motive is hatred or revenge.

184
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,880
Or an attempt to influence the
social agenda of the court.

185
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,760
What if the issue involved
old-fashioned material greed?

186
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,280
A case that involves a
great deal of money?

187
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,160
- Can I help you?
- I'd like to see this file, please.

188
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,120
Why?

189
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,280
It's public record, isn't it?

190
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,880
Semi-public.

191
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,280
Are you familiar with the
Freedom of Information Act?

192
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,480
This file has the pleading..

193
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,960
and correspondence. The rest
is discovery and the trial.

194
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,600
When was the trial? Last summer.

195
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,040
Went on for 2 months.
Where's the appeal?

196
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,960
Not perfected yet. I think
the deadline is August 1st.

197
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,640
So, who done it?

198
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,640
You have some obscure suspect unknown
to the FBI and the CIA and..

199
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,120
Secret Service and 10,000
police departments?

200
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,560
I had one..

201
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,640
which I have now discarded.

202
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:26,040
You skipped class, ignored me for
a week, just to throw it away?

203
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,480
Let me see it.

204
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:33,120
Don't laugh. It was ludicrous of
me to think I could solve it.

205
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,160
Hubris of the young, huh?

206
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,920
Don't knock the
hubris that I love.

207
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,600
I'm leaving tomorrow.

208
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,480
I'm going up to Rosenberg's
memorial in Washington.

209
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,480
I went through Rosenberg's
decisions the other night..

210
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,480
and in the back of my
mind there's an idea..

211
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,320
to do a book on him.

212
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,400
No one could do it better.

213
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,920
I started making notes..

214
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:14,680
about what he meant to me: surrogate
father, mentor, you know.

215
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,720
I started to get very thirsty.

216
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,960
I deserted you this week.

217
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,040
Not the greatest timing.

218
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,920
You're here to study
law, not keep me sober.

219
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,280
It's Alice.

220
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,120
Want to come out with
me for a burger?

221
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,120
No, thanks.

222
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,800
It might do you good to get out.

223
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,280
I'm fine, thanks.

224
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,640
You sure? Yes.

225
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,680
Okay, bye.

226
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,280
Hey, Sarge.

227
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,680
Hey, son.

228
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,280
Dark coffee, three sugars.

229
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,000
So how's the president?

230
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,880
Which one?

231
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,800
Not Coal, the real one.

232
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,320
Cool and mellow.

233
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:16,360
Would you believe he's all
tore up about Rosenberg?

234
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,480
And all fired up about..

235
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,400
restructuring the court.

236
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,320
Thinks it'll make his
place in history.

237
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,440
Sounds like Coal.
What'd you get me?

238
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,320
There's a short
list of nominees.

239
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,640
The original had 20 or so names,
then they cut it to 8. I gave you 2.

240
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,680
What about the investigation?

241
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,600
I haven't heard much..

242
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,640
but I'll keep my ears open.

243
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,080
- I know you will. Thanks.
- I got that.

244
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,560
I'll see you later.

245
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,480
Mellow, mellow, mellow.

246
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,920
Martini, please.

247
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,360
Good day. Good to see you.

248
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,160
Another coffee, please.

249
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,960
You read the Grantham article.

250
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,760
It had me running
around all day.

251
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,280
Coal blasted the director, saying the
judges' names were leaked by the FBI.

252
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:09,600
The director said Coal had leaked
them himself to test the waters.

253
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,240
Coal ran the most divisive
campaign in 20 years..

254
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,880
and the president did nothing.

255
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,520
I'd like to have seen your
name on this list of judges.

256
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,720
We all voted you most
likely to make the court.

257
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,200
These days, it's hard enough
just to make my class.

258
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,760
How old is she, this time?

259
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,560
Twenty-four. But she's..

260
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,160
extremely mature.

261
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,480
At 24, she's mature.

262
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,360
I don't know if I believe that.
Do you have a photo?

263
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,640
No, I don't. She's not a
puppy dog or a grandchild.

264
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,320
Thank God.

265
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,720
Who killed them, Gavin?

266
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,840
I'm just a lawyer with the
Bureau, I'm not an agent.

267
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,720
But, as I recall, you
have great ears.

268
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,560
To be honest, we
don't have a clue.

269
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:07,240
My girlfriend wrote a
very interesting essay..

270
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:10,520
on who might have ordered
the assassinations.

271
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,280
Your girlfriend has a theory?

272
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:18,760
Here, take a look at it. You'll get a
kick out of the way her mind works.

273
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,960
Is this Gray Grantham?
- Yes, it is.

274
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:44,520
Sorry to call at such a crazy hour.
I'm at a pay phone on my way to work.

275
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,760
I can't call from
home or the office.

276
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,720
What kind of office?

277
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,480
I'm an attorney.

278
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,440
Private or government?

279
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,480
I'd rather not say.

280
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,920
I may know something about
Rosenberg and Jensen.

281
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,680
Are you recording this?

282
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,480
Can this call be traced?

283
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,920
I'm not recording it or tracing it.
I promise you.

284
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,200
I may know who killed them.

285
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,960
What's your name?

286
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,440
Garcia.

287
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,440
That's not your real name.

288
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:26,680
I think I saw something at the
office I wasn't supposed to see.

289
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,000
Do you have a copy?

290
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,520
I need to think about this.

291
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,720
- I understand.
- I'm not thinking rationally.

292
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,120
Listen, I promise you..

293
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,120
I will protect you as a
confidential source.

294
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,120
Hello.

295
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,120
Got you.

296
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,960
Mr. Grantham's not here, but he
left his car number for you.

297
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,800
It's Garcia. I still
don't know what to do.

298
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,160
Mr. Garcia..

299
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:31,520
I've gone to jail rather
than reveal a source.

300
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,880
I know what kind of hell
this must be for you.

301
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,160
You're clearly a decent human
being, a good citizen.

302
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:43,640
But could you live with yourself
if you don't reveal what you know?

303
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,480
MORGAN I'll get back to you.

304
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,960
Taxi!

305
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:31,960
French authorities reviewed footage
from the airport cameras in Paris..

306
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:36,240
and think they recognized a face that
might be Khamel's, the terrorist.

307
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:41,040
He may have arrived here on a flight
10 hours after we found Jensen's body.

308
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,920
Anything else?

309
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,800
Maybe a small new wrinkle.

310
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,200
What's the wrinkle?

311
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,320
It's a theory that surfaced
in the last 24 hours.

312
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,520
Voyles is really
intrigued by it.

313
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,840
He's afraid it might be
damaging to the president.

314
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,360
How's that?

315
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,600
It's all there in the brief.

316
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,880
It's amateur stuff..

317
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,920
but how often does something make
Coal sweat and run for cover?

318
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,720
He didn't exactly
sweat in front of us.

319
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,560
But his stone face
showed he wasn't happy.

320
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,160
Did he have any symptoms?

321
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,880
As I told you, the president is
here for his annual checkup.

322
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,760
I wish I was in as good shape.

323
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,680
Was this timed to counter the
age issue in the next election?

324
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,600
Why didn't I think of that?

325
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,800
He hasn't decided
whether to run again.

326
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,600
When will he decide?

327
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,440
Do you really expect
me to answer that?

328
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,600
One rumor I can deny is that he
checked in to get away from you.

329
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,520
Although could you blame him?

330
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,880
Thank you again.

331
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,520
Commander, go downstairs & tell them
I have a date for golf this afternoon.

332
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,960
Yes, sir!

333
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,760
It's killing the press
you're so healthy.

334
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,480
Good. Now, what's so important?

335
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,480
This is..

336
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,320
a brief..

337
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,400
written by an
eager-beaver law student.

338
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:17,080
It's a theory about
the assassinations.

339
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,320
And indirectly..

340
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,080
it implicates the White House.

341
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,520
The premise is so
far-fetched it's absurd.

342
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,480
But Director Voyles, for reasons
both you and I can guess..

343
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,640
is going after it.

344
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,600
Well, we..

345
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,640
We can't interfere with
his investigation.

346
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,480
You should ask Giminski to
have the CIA investigate.

347
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:48,760
When we confirm that this is garbage,
you can ask Voyles to back off.

348
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,160
It's domestic.

349
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:55,560
The CIA can't go nosing around.
It's illegal.

350
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,560
Yes, technically.

351
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,560
What about..

352
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,160
your friend..

353
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:06,680
Barr, and the Unit, I
think you call it.

354
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,960
I've spoken to Barr.

355
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,960
They're very good for
small specific missions..

356
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,960
but they aren't the CIA.

357
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,040
How does it implicate
the White House? Names?

358
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,600
One name.

359
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,440
Someone we both know?

360
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,880
Mr. President..

361
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,400
I've decided my agenda
for the future.

362
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,720
I'll stay in bed..

363
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,520
drink..

364
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,640
make love..

365
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,920
and forget the whole
damn business.

366
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,440
You don't approve.

367
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,400
What about the
book on Rosenberg?

368
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,400
You should write it.

369
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,320
- Let's go.
- You should.

370
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,640
You have the youth, the
energy, the certitude.

371
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,280
You'd be perfect.

372
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,480
Can I have the keys?

373
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,840
I'm perfectly
capable of driving.

374
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,360
You've drunk too much.

375
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,520
Give me the keys.

376
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,040
Remember the Mashed Potato?
Give me the keys.

377
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,880
- You're too young.
- I know it.

378
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,320
Do you remember the Fishback?

379
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,520
- The Slide?
- No. Please.

380
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,800
- Please what?
- Give me the keys.

381
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,800
Give me the keys. I'll
drive or I'll walk.

382
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,280
You'll walk? Yes.

383
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,800
Have a nice stroll.

384
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,640
Miss Shaw!

385
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,600
You take my breath away!

386
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,800
Thomas!

387
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,000
Oh, my God!

388
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,280
Watch the door.

389
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,960
I'm Sergeant Rupert, NOPD.

390
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,120
You'll be safe in my car.

391
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,560
Your name?

392
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,520
Darby Shaw.

393
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,000
Let's go.

394
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,200
Is this your car?

395
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,240
Come here.

396
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,640
I'm Lieutenant Olsen, NOPD.

397
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,320
I'm taking you to the hospital.

398
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,400
Check the plates.

399
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,280
Did you know the man in the car?

400
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,480
Thomas Callahan.

401
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,440
It'll be a few minutes.

402
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:14,840
Are you sure that the man who called
himself Rupert said he was a cop?

403
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,520
We don't have a record of a cop
named Rupert. The computer..

404
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:27,240
has no record of the tag numbers of
the car you were in. Must be fake.

405
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,720
I'll go move the car.
I'll be back.

406
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,160
All right?

407
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,840
Gavin Verheek?

408
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,280
This is Darby Shaw.
Do you know who I am?

409
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,040
We have a mutual friend.

410
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,840
Thomas gave you a
copy of my theory.

411
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,160
Yes, he did.

412
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,680
Where is it?

413
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:50,520
I read it and I showed it to
some folks at the Bureau..

414
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,800
who sent it to Director Voyles.

415
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,480
Has it been seen
outside of the FBI?

416
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,560
I can't answer that.

417
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,480
Then I won't tell you
what's happened to Thomas.

418
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,800
Okay, yes.

419
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,960
It's been seen outside the
FBI, but by whom I don't know.

420
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,360
He's dead, Gavin.

421
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,720
He was murdered. Someone planted
a car bomb for both of us.

422
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,360
I got lucky, but
they're after me.

423
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,760
What's your phone number?
Where are you?

424
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,520
Not so fast.

425
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,200
Come on! Thomas Callahan
was my best friend.

426
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,520
I'll have agents pick you up.
You can't stay on the street.

427
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:34,440
Thomas is dead because he talked to you.
You tell that to Director Voyles.

428
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,880
Turn up the TV,
I can't hear Regis & Kathie Lee.

429
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,000
Down.

430
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,480
Mr. President.

431
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:55,160
Sit down. You must see this. We've
been working on this all morning.

432
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,960
You have your first audience.

433
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,480
Over. Roll over.

434
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,200
Roll over.

435
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,760
How serious is this
Pelican thing?

436
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,920
I've assigned 14
agents in New Orleans.

437
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:11,480
I doubt if there's anything to
it, but we must check it out.

438
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,440
I don't have to tell you..

439
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:17,120
how much trouble and pain
this nonsense could cause..

440
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,200
if the press gets wind of it.

441
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:22,680
Oh, well, you got half of it.
Good boy.

442
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,640
I just wish..

443
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,200
that you'd..

444
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,200
back off the thing..

445
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,160
I mean..

446
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,440
it's a goose chase.

447
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:37,560
Are you asking me to ignore
a suspect, Mr. President?

448
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,080
If the press..

449
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,040
gets wind of what you're after
and starts digging, I'll be..

450
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,440
We'll be crucified.

451
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,760
So you're asking me to back off?

452
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,000
Back off and chase
the real suspects.

453
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,360
Ignore it for a few
weeks, that's all.

454
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:07,640
Your hatchet man did a real number on
me with the press. They ate my lunch..

455
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,280
over the security..

456
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,880
we provided Jensen
and Rosenberg.

457
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:17,800
Get that pit bull off my ass and I'll
forget the Pelican theory a while.

458
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,200
May I have your card?

459
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,720
I'll pay with cash.

460
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,240
Verheek. Yes.

461
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:44,680
What did Voyles say?

462
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:48,320
Mr. Voyles has been unavailable.

463
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:51,320
But I will try to speak to
him later this afternoon.

464
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,000
I expected more.

465
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,840
There's a memorial
service tomorrow.

466
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:01,200
I'll be there tonight.

467
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,000
I think we should meet.

468
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:05,800
Darby, I can save your life.

469
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,920
You can't even talk
to the director.

470
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:13,560
Where will you stay?

471
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,600
At the Westin, by the river.

472
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,400
Okay.

473
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:49,080
She's watching TV.

474
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:52,840
They've been looking under rocks.
She's using credit cards.

475
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,960
She'll be dead in 48 hours.

476
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,880
I'll give her 72.

477
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,840
We'll meet at 6 A.M.

478
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,320
All right, Bob.

479
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,560
Hooten, stay.

480
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:13,880
This means her little
brief is right on point.

481
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:16,960
Will you notify the president?

482
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,720
Notifying the president..

483
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,920
means notifying Coal.

484
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:25,880
Gray Grantham's article in
tomorrow's Washington Herald..

485
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,640
maintains that, according to
unnamed White House sources..

486
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:31,200
the Mid-Eastern
terrorist, Khamel..

487
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:35,800
may be among those who assassinated
Justices Rosenberg and Jensen.

488
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,560
Those sources say that a country known
for sponsoring terrorist activity..

489
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:42,120
may have hired Khamel.

490
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:48,720
It's Garcia.

491
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:51,680
I'm on the corner of
Pennsylvania Avenue and First.

492
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:56,120
Take down my license number;
there's a lot of gray Volvos out there.

493
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:57,920
8-5-6..

494
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:01,000
V-N-N.

495
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,120
Right.

496
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:05,880
- Ten minutes.
- Yes.

497
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,360
My keys!

498
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:21,640
I can't go through with it.

499
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:26,680
Let's get together anyway.

500
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:31,440
You'll feel better if we meet and
you don't have to reveal anything.

501
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:33,400
I have a wife and daughter.

502
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,360
There's a chance they
know that I know.

503
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:37,800
The guys at the firm?

504
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,640
I didn't tell you
I was in a firm.

505
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:43,960
You go to work too early
to be a government lawyer.

506
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:47,280
You must work at a firm
where they expect people..

507
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:49,480
to work at least
100 hours a week.

508
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:13,440
Garcia, we can work this thing out
if you just get together with me.

509
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:15,680
Garcia?

510
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:18,600
Who's this?

511
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,680
Is this Gray Grantham?

512
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:22,440
Yes. Who's this?

513
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,960
Have you heard of
the Pelican Brief?

514
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:27,640
The what?

515
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:29,720
Pelican Brief.

516
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,360
No. Never heard of it.

517
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,640
It's an unlikely little theory about
who killed Rosenberg and Jensen.

518
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:41,080
A friend of mine took
it to Washington.

519
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:44,280
He gave it to a friend in the
FBI and it was passed around.

520
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,920
My friend was killed
in a car bomb.

521
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:48,840
Wait now.

522
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:52,160
Your friend took it to the FBI..

523
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,760
and then he was killed?
What's his name?

524
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,200
I can't tell you that.

525
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:01,240
How do you know all this?

526
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:03,320
I wrote the brief.

527
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:06,520
Are you a lawyer?

528
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:07,960
No.

529
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:10,800
Where are you calling from?

530
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:14,680
I'd rather you not ask
me any more questions.

531
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:17,080
You called me.

532
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:18,520
What's your name?

533
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,560
- Alice.
- You called me, Alice.

534
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:26,920
Can you get a list of the major
presidential campaign contributors?

535
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:30,520
Yes. Sure. I can
have it tomorrow.

536
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:34,200
You know who did these killings?

537
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,280
Yes.

538
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:40,440
Let's cut to the chase.
Who did it?

539
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:43,240
Let's take it slow.
I'll be in touch.

540
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:44,440
When?

541
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,280
Hi.

542
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:19,480
How are you?

543
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:21,720
How are you?

544
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:25,400
Did you get into my apartment?

545
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:28,000
Your computer's gone.

546
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:30,520
So are your floppy disks.

547
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,920
And your red expandable files.

548
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:37,320
I need you to do me a favor.

549
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,840
Go to the memorial
service tomorrow..

550
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:46,200
and spread the word I called to say
I'm staying with an aunt in Denver.

551
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,920
And I won't be back until fall.

552
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:52,680
What is going on?

553
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:59,320
Are you okay about money?

554
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:03,200
I have the money
my father left me.

555
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,480
Who are you hiding from?

556
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:14,840
I think you better
go now, Alice.

557
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:24,840
It would be better for
me if you go now.

558
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,640
That's not fair.

559
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:47,160
The prettiest girl in the Quarter,
the saddest girl in the Quarter.

560
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:52,200
I can't get you to
give me a smile?

561
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:58,680
I saw that.

562
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:00,440
That's something.

563
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:10,200
Just one beer? No.

564
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,440
I've found my mission in life.

565
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,080
To make you smile.

566
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:18,240
You must find another mission.

567
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:27,720
Wait!

568
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:31,160
Will you marry me,
just for 5 minutes?

569
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:34,680
I know it's stupid, but I think
we're fated for each other.

570
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,280
I must go now.

571
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:39,400
Please, you're not going to
walk out on me, are you?

572
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:41,920
I'd walk a million miles

573
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,040
For one of your smiles

574
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:45,560
You beautiful

575
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,000
You wonderful girl

576
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:49,480
From the laundry

577
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:53,720
You've got the wrong girl.

578
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:57,560
Go get her.

579
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:28,680
Please, help me!

580
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:16,760
Looking for Mr. Sneller.

581
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,080
Mr. Sneller?

582
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:20,800
Yes, Mr. Edwin F. Sneller.

583
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:13,440
Have you heard from Darby?

584
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:14,840
Yes, I did.

585
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:18,560
I got a note from her. She's
staying with an aunt in Colorado.

586
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:21,760
But she's going to be
back next semester.

587
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:34,520
I'll see you later.

588
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,400
Gavin, it's Darby.

589
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:05,240
I'd just about given up on you.

590
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,960
Tell me where you want to meet
and I'll come with 3 agents.

591
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,280
I thought the FBI
was not involved.

592
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:14,440
It's not involved, not yet.
I have friends.

593
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:17,880
We can get you out of the city
tonight, in Washington tomorrow.

594
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:20,440
I promise you'll meet Voyles.

595
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:21,960
We'll go from there.

596
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:25,440
At noon tomorrow, take the
trolley to Riverwalk.

597
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:27,160
Wait, Riverwalk?

598
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:30,760
Wear a long sleeve shirt
and a red baseball cap.

599
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:34,360
Wait on the riverside
at the bandstand..

600
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:36,120
and I'll find you.

601
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:38,200
The riverside bandstand.

602
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:42,120
- How tall are you?
- 5'10".

603
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:43,360
Your weight?

604
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,400
About 180, but I'm
planning on losing it.

605
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:48,320
I'll see you tomorrow.

606
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:49,680
Tomorrow.

607
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:06,360
Gavin, it's Darby.

608
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:08,760
I'd just about given up on you.

609
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:12,840
Tell me where you want to meet
and I'll come with 3 agents.

610
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:16,760
I thought the FBI
was not involved.

611
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:18,880
It's not involved, not yet.

612
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:21,080
I have friends.

613
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:24,600
We'll get you out of the city
tonight, in Washington tomorrow.

614
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:27,720
I promise you'll meet Voyles.

615
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:29,760
We'll go from there.

616
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:33,560
At noon tomorrow, take the
trolley to Riverwalk.

617
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:37,400
Wear a long sleeve shirt
and a red baseball cap.

618
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:41,400
Wait on the riverside at the
bandstand and I'll find you.

619
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:43,720
The riverside bandstand?

620
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:48,240
- How tall are you?
- 5'10".

621
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:49,560
Your weight?

622
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:52,440
About 180, but I'm
planning on losing it.

623
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:54,880
All right.

624
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,400
Tell me where you want to meet..

625
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:05,640
Tell me where you want to meet..

626
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:08,960
and within an hour I'll
come get you with 3 agents.

627
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:38,040
Mr. Sneller on line 2.

628
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:45,240
Khamel is dead. We
don't know who did it.

629
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:47,560
- And the girl?
- She's running.

630
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:50,000
We lost her. We'll find her.

631
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:07,480
There's been another murder.

632
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:12,200
You remember my friend gave the
brief to a friend at the FBI?

633
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:16,040
The FBI friend was
killed yesterday.

634
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:18,960
How do you know?

635
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,880
I was holding his hand.
He was shot..

636
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:25,360
in broad daylight in a crowd.

637
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,400
I'm very sorry.

638
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:31,320
I'm in New York now.
When can you come?

639
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:34,800
You'll have to give me
something I can confirm.

640
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:39,800
We get crank calls from people claiming
to know who killed Rosenberg & Jensen.

641
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:42,280
Something you can confirm?

642
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:43,480
Please.

643
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:45,240
Such as?

644
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:49,040
The name of the friend that was
murdered in the car explosion.

645
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:54,080
Take your time.

646
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:57,040
Callahan.

647
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:00,520
His first name?

648
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:01,800
Thomas.

649
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:03,960
Where did it happen?

650
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:07,600
In New Orleans. I think
that should be enough.

651
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:11,480
All right.

652
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:17,880
What's the name of the friend
that worked at the FBI?

653
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:19,880
Verheek.

654
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:21,800
Gavin Verheek.

655
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:24,200
Voyles' Chief Counsel.

656
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:26,600
I think that's more than enough.

657
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:30,520
I'll be on a plane
this afternoon.

658
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:33,240
You must follow my instructions.

659
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:48,280
This is Gray Grantham.

660
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:52,160
That's right.

661
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:57,240
Got it.

662
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:15,080
Did you follow my instructions?

663
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:17,400
Yes.

664
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:48,560
You must think I'm crazy.

665
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:51,440
Yes, I did..

666
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:55,480
till I checked New Orleans.

667
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:57,800
Callahan was..

668
01:05:58,160 --> 01:05:59,960
killed exactly as you said.

669
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:03,720
I also checked Verheek.
According to the FBI..

670
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:06,360
they found his body 2 days ago..

671
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:08,880
in a hotel room early
in the morning.

672
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:13,280
He'd been dead for
at least 8 hours.

673
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:16,520
That can't be.

674
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:20,840
Want to talk about the brief?

675
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:25,960
Everyone I've told about
the brief is dead.

676
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:28,760
I'll take my chances.

677
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:33,200
You can't, under any
circumstances, use my name..

678
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:36,280
or reveal how you got
the information.

679
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:39,680
Or publish anything until I've
left the country. Agreed?

680
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:42,040
Unless I can convince
you otherwise.

681
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:43,480
You can't.

682
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:48,320
May I sit down?

683
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:53,840
Mind if I use a tape recorder?

684
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:07,400
Interesting read, isn't it?

685
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:10,800
What'd the president say?

686
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:13,880
He spoke to Voyles..

687
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:17,480
who will leave it
alone for a while.

688
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:20,840
The president asked
Voyles to back off?

689
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:25,240
We thought it was just another shot
in the dark. Now I'm not sure.

690
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:27,480
That's obstruction of justice.

691
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:29,600
Assuming the brief
turns out to be true.

692
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:32,840
If it does, you'll
be the fall guy.

693
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:38,120
I won't be the only one.

694
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:40,600
The old Nixon two-step.

695
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:43,000
Don't even think that name.

696
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:46,360
Look at the hopeful side,
Irangate, Iraqgate..

697
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:48,440
Good chance it won't come out.

698
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:51,320
What's up with Grantham?

699
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:54,960
We got his car phone. We haven't
been inside the home yet.

700
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:57,000
Why not?

701
01:07:57,560 --> 01:08:00,280
We almost got caught
by the cleaning lady.

702
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:06,840
Grantham knows about the brief.

703
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:09,720
He called 3 White
House aides today..

704
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:11,800
and God knows who else.

705
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:15,440
What made you hone in on this
particular case so quickly?

706
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:20,920
I remembered this piece that
"Frontline" did a year ago..

707
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:25,840
about the young lawyer who
originally filed the suit.

708
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:31,800
They said he'd committed suicide,
but his family thought it was foul play.

709
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:39,880
After the assassinations,
I called his family.

710
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:43,960
They said he had a depressive
problem years before..

711
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:46,760
but medication had
taken care of it.

712
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:50,840
His doctor confirmed
what the family said.

713
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:55,280
They told the police they were
not convinced it was suicide.

714
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:00,560
But the police closed
the investigation.

715
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:04,280
Exactly.

716
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:12,800
That's it. That's the brief.

717
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:18,560
Maybe we could..

718
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:21,240
finish up in the morning?

719
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:34,680
I'll be up late going
over my notes..

720
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:36,560
while they're fresh in my head.

721
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:40,040
Call me when you wake up.

722
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:45,520
Try and get some sleep.

723
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:55,280
Mr. Grantham.

724
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:01,280
I know it sounds silly, but..

725
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,080
would you sleep on the sofa?

726
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:10,880
No problem.

727
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:18,920
Good night.

728
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:21,440
Listen..

729
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:24,720
At the risk of sounding
old-fashioned..

730
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:27,880
isn't it time I knew
your real name?

731
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:31,800
Darby Shaw.

732
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:35,840
What made you pick
me, Darby Shaw?

733
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:41,080
Callahan was a fan.

734
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:53,720
Does the name Victor Mattiece
mean anything to you?

735
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:55,320
Money.

736
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:56,480
Power.

737
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:58,680
Influence.

738
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:04,400
He's made & lost several fortunes
drilling oil in Louisiana.

739
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:07,280
In 1979..

740
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:11,640
his oil company punched some holes
in Terrebonne Parish and hit oil.

741
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:13,040
A lot of oil.

742
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:15,960
He needed governmental
permission..

743
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:20,240
to dredge a channel though the
marshlands to get the oil out.

744
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:23,720
Enter Mattiece, the great
campaign contributor..

745
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:25,560
and as night follows day..

746
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:29,200
government permission to gouge
through the endangered marshes.

747
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:33,920
Mattiece is that close to at
least a billion dollars..

748
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:35,360
when Green Fund..

749
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:37,640
an obscure
environmental outfit..

750
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:41,880
trots down to the U.S. District court
in Lafayette and files a lawsuit..

751
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:44,280
to stop the entire operation.

752
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:47,920
Of course, Mattiece spares no
expense to win the lawsuit.

753
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:52,520
I don't think there's a top law firm
between Houston & New Orleans..

754
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:54,480
that he hasn't hired.

755
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:57,000
Fucking PBS!

756
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:59,920
By the time the Green
Fund lawyers..

757
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:01,160
all two of them..

758
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:03,240
wade in, the joint ventures..

759
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:06,520
limited partnerships and
corporate associations..

760
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:09,800
form an impenetrable maze that
makes Mattiece invisible.

761
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:13,080
Luckily for the Green
Fund's lawsuit..

762
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:17,680
the heart of the new oil reserve is
near a natural refuge for waterfowl:

763
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:22,320
Osprey, egrets, pelicans,
ducks, cranes, geese.

764
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:25,000
The pelican becomes the hero.

765
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:29,520
After 30 years of contamination
by DDT and other pesticides..

766
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:33,000
the Louisiana brown pelican is
on the brink of extinction.

767
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:36,440
Green Fund seizes the bird
and enlists experts..

768
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:39,480
from around the country
to testify on its behalf.

769
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:44,480
It takes 7 years for the pelican
suit to go to trial in Lake Charles.

770
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:48,760
The 3-man jury, caring less
about the pelicans than jobs..

771
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
votes in favor of Mattiece.

772
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:56,000
But the judge rules to keep the
injunction against drilling because..

773
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:59,320
he thinks Green Fund has proven
its point about the pelican..

774
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:03,600
a federally-protected species,
and that it will appeal.

775
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:05,240
What's the lawsuit's status?

776
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:08,000
From the trial level..

777
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:11,960
it will be appealed to the Court of
Appeals in New Orleans in a month.

778
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:15,240
Any idea what the court will do?

779
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:17,120
It could be reversed.

780
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:22,000
Then the fun starts. If either
side is unhappy with the court..

781
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:24,280
they can appeal to
the Supreme Court.

782
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:28,560
From today, how long would it take
for a decision by the Supreme Court?

783
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:31,160
Anywhere from 3 to 5 years.

784
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:33,200
Rosenberg would have died.

785
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:37,520
But another president could be
in the White House when he died.

786
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:39,200
So if you're Mattiece..

787
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:42,360
and you don't mind killing
a couple of Supremes..

788
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:46,160
now's the time to kill them, when
you can predict their replacement.

789
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:47,640
But why Jensen?

790
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:50,960
He shared one piece of common
ground with Rosenberg:

791
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:52,760
Protecting the environment.

792
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:35,160
I didn't mean to wake you.

793
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:48,120
You said that Mattiece hired law
firms from Houston to New Orleans.

794
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:51,160
Were there any in Washington?

795
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:53,200
Maybe two.

796
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:56,880
White & Blazevich..

797
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:02,040
and Brim, Stearns & Somebody.

798
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:04,400
Great!

799
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:07,640
I got a call from
a lawyer in D.C..

800
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:10,040
who saw something concerning
Rosenberg and Jensen.

801
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:13,840
He backed out of our meeting.
I never heard from him again.

802
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,000
He gave me a phony name,
but I got his picture.

803
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:19,640
How?

804
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:24,200
Long story. If he works at one of these
law firms, he could be our confirmation.

805
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:26,840
I hope you find him.

806
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:30,320
Come with me to Washington.

807
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:33,720
I've had enough.

808
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:38,280
If you're right about Mattiece,
then there'll be a cover-up.

809
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:39,760
It'll probably work.

810
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:41,360
How do you know?

811
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:44,480
I called the Herald
morgue last night.

812
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:47,720
Two years ago, a
reporter did a piece..

813
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:51,080
on "Violations of
Campaign Financing Laws."

814
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:55,320
He found out that, hidden under a
lot of other names of individuals..

815
01:15:55,600 --> 01:16:00,120
and PAC's and corporations,
Mattiece was the biggest contributor,

816
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:01,560
by far..

817
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:03,440
to the president's campaign.

818
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:07,280
We ran a picture, with the article,
of the president and Mattiece.

819
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:10,360
It was taken unbeknownst
to either one.

820
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:13,960
In it, the president and Mattiece are
in front of Mattiece's hunting lodge..

821
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:16,840
sipping on some bourbon,
having a good laugh.

822
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:18,520
The best of pals.

823
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:21,400
The captions said: "The
President's Most Secret..

824
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:24,120
and Generous Contributor."

825
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:29,160
Now if your brief is right and it
ever reaches the light of day..

826
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:31,880
the president loses any
chance of reelection.

827
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:34,680
The men around the president
won't let that happen.

828
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:38,960
I checked with my sources. The
Bureau, Langley, the White House..

829
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:41,680
all said the brief
doesn't exist.

830
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:48,080
You may be the only witness to the fact
there is a brief. If you disappear..

831
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:49,760
so does justice.

832
01:16:53,240 --> 01:16:55,280
Is that what
Callahan would want?

833
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:01,080
He'd want me to see
my 25th birthday.

834
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,280
Darby.

835
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:08,680
If this thing reaches as deep and
goes as high as we think it does..

836
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:11,240
they'll do anything
not to be exposed.

837
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:14,520
Where can you hide?

838
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:16,400
Go back to Washington.

839
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:29,400
They're all shook up about
you asking about something.

840
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:30,520
I expected that.

841
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:33,360
It's like the Gestapo over there.
Coal clears everything.

842
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:35,880
They put me on medical
leave for 90 days.

843
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:38,240
- What's wrong with you?
- I don't know.

844
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:41,840
One thing I do know, I've
never seen it this bad.

845
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:43,920
I'm worried about you, son.

846
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:49,680
Gray, it's Darby.

847
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:52,920
When you hear this, I'll be in
the air on my way to nowhere.

848
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:56,960
Try to understand.

849
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:00,400
I can't keep you on that story.

850
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:02,360
I'm sending you to Arkansas.

851
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:04,440
The Times, the networks..

852
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:08,160
are there checking out the judge
they're about to nominate.

853
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:09,280
I need more time.

854
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:10,800
For what?

855
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:15,760
You lost your White House sources,
you've lost Garcia and the girl.

856
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:17,680
Not your best week.

857
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:20,360
You can't take me
off this story.

858
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:23,720
What do you know for fact?

859
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:27,320
An unidentified guy says he
knows about the assassinations.

860
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:31,920
He works in a law firm, you don't know
which one. He's cut off all contact.

861
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:34,200
That's not very promising.

862
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:37,000
There's something
there, I can smell it.

863
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:42,680
Evidence based on olfactory prowess is
inadmissible, in case you didn't know.

864
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:44,200
Then there's a girl..

865
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:47,120
with her bird brief for which
you can't get confirmation.

866
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:48,240
Not yet.

867
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:52,200
She also cut off contact, something
that's reaching epidemic proportions.

868
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:54,200
They're waiting
for you upstairs.

869
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:58,640
Everything she said about the
two deaths has been confirmed.

870
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:01,800
The FBI says Verheek was
killed in some hotel mugging.

871
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:03,960
- That's what you told me.
- That's what they told me.

872
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:07,240
And they said they knew of no
connection with the assassinations.

873
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:10,280
What else would they say? I'm
interested in what they did say.

874
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:13,760
Let's look at what
I have confirmed.

875
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:18,000
Callahan was killed. He was
a professor. They had an affair.

876
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:21,160
Give it to the Times-Picayune.
Maybe they want some gossip.

877
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:23,960
I also found that Callahan clerked
for Rosenberg 20 years ago.

878
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:26,240
Life is filled with
odd coincidence.

879
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:28,040
Not a coincidence if the brief-

880
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:30,480
You have no confirmation
there is a brief.

881
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:32,920
I confirmed Verheek and
Callahan were friends.

882
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:37,240
They met here a few weeks ago, when
he must have given him the brief.

883
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:39,880
- Supposition again.
- I've confirmed the pelican lawsuit.

884
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:43,920
On which she has based her suppositions.
It's all just suppositions.

885
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:46,640
You know what Mattiece could do?

886
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:48,720
I know what he has done already.

887
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:50,520
He has a bizarre history.

888
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:53,720
So do I, according to my ex-wife. It
doesn't mean that I killed the Justices.

889
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,960
But it means it's
worth exploring.

890
01:19:57,800 --> 01:20:02,520
Go down to that crappy cabin of yours
on the weekend, hole up, retrench.

891
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:07,280
Prove you have a way to revitalize this
story, and I might keep you on it.

892
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:12,200
But if I were you, I'd check
where to eat in Little Rock.

893
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:21,800
This is the story of a mystery
that may never be solved.

894
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:25,640
The story of a brilliant young
lawyer who loved this land..

895
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:29,240
and wanted to fight to preserve
it from the inroads of man..

896
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:31,000
until his abrupt death..

897
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:33,080
a few months ago.

898
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:38,480
His body was found in a lonely cottage,
near the Louisiana bayou he loved.

899
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:40,880
There was a bullet in his head..

900
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:42,760
and a gun beside him.

901
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:46,400
The coroner and police
have deemed it a suicide.

902
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:50,520
But he died sitting at a computer,
surrounded by his notes..

903
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:53,320
for what he called the
case he was born to win.

904
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:57,160
His friends and family ask..

905
01:20:57,400 --> 01:21:00,120
would anyone commit suicide
in such a manner..

906
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:01,680
at such a time?

907
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:06,000
Tonight, Frontline explores
a young idealist's death.

908
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:55,280
Who's there?

909
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:58,480
It's Darby!

910
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:19,760
I got your message.

911
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:25,400
If they bugged your phone, they'd
think I'd left the country.

912
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,160
Did you find that
lawyer in D.C.?

913
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:35,920
Not yet.

914
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:39,000
My editor wants to
take me off the story.

915
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:42,560
I could help you find him.

916
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:46,880
How'd you find me?

917
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:50,760
I called your editor.

918
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:53,840
He told you?

919
01:22:56,960 --> 01:23:01,520
I told him I was your sister Mary from
out of town and couldn't find you.

920
01:23:04,440 --> 01:23:06,200
How'd you know I
had a sister Mary?

921
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:10,280
You're not the only
one doing research.

922
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:38,360
It was a beautiful service.

923
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:41,200
Thank you, Mr. President.

924
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:54,960
I'll have an announcement
after the weekend.

925
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:07,960
It was the right thing to do, no
matter where the body was found.

926
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:17,880
You can't announce the
nominations next week.

927
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:20,200
You said they'd be
vetted this weekend.

928
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:22,120
There must be a change in plans.

929
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:23,840
I don't understand.

930
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:26,000
The Pelican Brief.

931
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:29,880
What about the Pelican Brief?

932
01:24:30,160 --> 01:24:32,720
I thought that was
ancient history.

933
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:35,840
We believe that Grantham's
gotten ahold of it.

934
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:39,400
Mattiece will sue them if
they try to publish that.

935
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:40,840
Not if it's true.

936
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:48,680
You think it's true?

937
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:51,560
I know what Grantham will write:

938
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:54,000
"A man who gave the
president millions.."

939
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:57,040
had two Supreme Court Justices
killed so the president..

940
01:24:57,240 --> 01:24:59,800
could appoint more
reasonable judges..

941
01:25:00,040 --> 01:25:02,120
"so his oil could
be harvested."

942
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:07,000
If Voyles says you told him to back off
the case, we face an obstruction charge.

943
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:08,680
Oh, Jesus!

944
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:13,800
There's a way to handle this.

945
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:15,280
Handle it how?

946
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:19,040
We appoint two nature-lovers
to the court.

947
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:23,760
Good environmentalists who'd
kill Mattiece and his oil field.

948
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:27,680
Meet with Voyles, in the presence
of the Attorney General..

949
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:30,480
and demand an investigation
into Mattiece.

950
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:33,320
I'll leak the brief to
every reporter in town.

951
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:35,840
Then we ride out the storm.

952
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:40,920
But there has to be some way to keep
this information from coming out.

953
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:42,440
I'm working on it.

954
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:45,840
What? How?

955
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:47,240
Mr. President..

956
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:49,040
you don't want to know.

957
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:01,480
What's this all about?

958
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:03,480
A trip to Mt. Vernon
will do you good.

959
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:05,080
Are you losing it?

960
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:08,720
First I order you to go to
Little Rock, you refuse to go.

961
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:11,800
You refuse to tell me
why, then you order me..

962
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:13,880
your boss, I might add..

963
01:26:14,160 --> 01:26:17,160
to drop everything and meet
you at George's place.

964
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:20,000
I thought of making
you unemployed..

965
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:22,200
but you'd sue me for
discrimination.

966
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:23,600
She's here.

967
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:26,040
- The bird girl?
- She's here.

968
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:29,240
- You could've told me.
- Not wise.

969
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:32,840
By the way, refusing to tell me
where you could be reached..

970
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:34,760
didn't leave a good impression.

971
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,640
It's too risky to go to my
apartment or to the job.

972
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:40,200
- Where have you been?
- In a little hotel.

973
01:26:40,440 --> 01:26:43,040
This is a hell of a time to
punch notches in your belt.

974
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:46,440
We're not in the same hotel.
She's helping me find Garcia.

975
01:26:46,680 --> 01:26:49,080
It sounds like she's in control.

976
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:50,600
It's the only way she'd play.

977
01:26:51,160 --> 01:26:53,040
So what if you
can't find Garcia?

978
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:55,000
We go to plan B. What's that?

979
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:58,200
We attack the lawyers directly.
What if it's another firm?

980
01:26:58,440 --> 01:26:59,720
We go to plan C. What's that?

981
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:02,040
We didn't go that far.
What if you do?

982
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:04,840
I must be able to get
in touch with you.

983
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:10,800
I'm at the Marbury Hotel, room 833.
Don't use my name.

984
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:12,320
Write it down.

985
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:16,280
You mind getting off
at the next exit?

986
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:17,600
Why?

987
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:20,840
A tan car's been two
cars behind us..

988
01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:23,600
since we got on the parkway.

989
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:43,880
I thought it was following us.

990
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:45,080
Right.

991
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:28,240
Georgetown Law School, please.

992
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:35,720
Hurry.

993
01:29:39,720 --> 01:29:41,480
Meet me by the stacks.

994
01:29:54,920 --> 01:29:56,680
Someone was in my room.

995
01:29:58,680 --> 01:30:00,520
Did you tell anyone
where you were?

996
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:03,080
Smith Keen, but he'd
never repeat it.

997
01:30:03,560 --> 01:30:05,240
Did you tell him by phone?

998
01:30:05,480 --> 01:30:06,560
No. We were..

999
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:09,520
We were in his car.

1000
01:30:10,120 --> 01:30:11,840
Georgetown Law Center.
Placement Office, please.

1001
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,880
One moment, please.
Placement Office.

1002
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:17,320
This is Susan Johnson. I'm a
partner with White & Blazevich.

1003
01:30:17,560 --> 01:30:21,160
We're trying to reconstruct
some payroll records.

1004
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:25,400
May I have the names of your students
that clerked here last summer?

1005
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:29,080
I'm from White & Blazevich.
You have something for me?

1006
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:33,720
Would you sign this, please?

1007
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:42,560
- Thank you, Mr. Stevens.
- You're welcome.

1008
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:45,160
I'll call these five
and see who's home.

1009
01:30:45,480 --> 01:30:49,360
I'll take the two with no phone
number & get their class schedules.

1010
01:30:55,320 --> 01:30:56,400
See you later.

1011
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:05,120
I'm from the Washington Herald.
I'm looking for..

1012
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:07,720
- Robert Akers and Laura Kaas.
- Is there a problem?

1013
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:09,880
No problem. Just a few
questions I want to ask.

1014
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:12,320
Are they in class this morning?

1015
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:16,080
One moment, please.

1016
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:23,960
Excuse me.

1017
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:25,760
Do you have ID?

1018
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:31,040
Could I speak to
Dennis Maylor, please?

1019
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:33,400
No, I'm Keith Maylor.

1020
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:36,080
I'm sorry to bother you.

1021
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:44,920
Akers has Criminal Procedure,
Kaas has Administrative Law.

1022
01:31:45,160 --> 01:31:48,840
I'll try to find them. Maylor,
Reinhart & Wilson were all at home.

1023
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:50,520
I can go to Maylor's.

1024
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:54,040
Excuse me.

1025
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:58,680
- Do you know Laura Kaas?
- She's the girl with the red backpack.

1026
01:32:04,120 --> 01:32:07,800
Do you recognize this man? He's
a lawyer at White & Blazevich.

1027
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:10,400
We're down to Akers and Linney.

1028
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:11,960
Linney's phone was disconnected.

1029
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:14,240
I'll get his class schedule.

1030
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:16,200
I'll keep looking for Akers.

1031
01:32:16,840 --> 01:32:18,000
It's me again.

1032
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:21,360
I need the class schedule
for Edward Linney.

1033
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:23,160
I'm sorry, Mr. Grantham.

1034
01:32:23,480 --> 01:32:27,880
A student you talked to called White
and  Blazevich, who called the Dean.

1035
01:32:28,440 --> 01:32:31,040
No more class schedules
for reporters.

1036
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:43,080
Mr. Grantham.

1037
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:45,920
I know Edward.

1038
01:32:46,680 --> 01:32:50,720
He's dropped out of school for a while.
Personal problems.

1039
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:52,400
Where is he?

1040
01:32:52,680 --> 01:32:55,280
His parents put him in
a private hospital.

1041
01:32:55,960 --> 01:32:57,920
He's being detoxified.

1042
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:02,120
Look, he's a good guy.

1043
01:33:03,720 --> 01:33:05,480
Parklane Hospital.

1044
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:30,360
Good afternoon.

1045
01:33:32,040 --> 01:33:33,440
May I see Edward Linney?

1046
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:36,280
- What room is he in?
- What's your name?

1047
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:39,320
Gray Grantham,
Washington Herald.

1048
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:42,040
The law school said
I could see him.

1049
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:43,960
I'm sorry they did.

1050
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:48,240
We run this hospital and
they run their law school.

1051
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:51,120
May I see your administrator?

1052
01:33:52,680 --> 01:33:54,360
I'll see if I can find him.

1053
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:20,200
Mr. Grantham.

1054
01:34:20,440 --> 01:34:22,000
Great architecture.

1055
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:24,440
I'm sorry, Mr. Grantham.

1056
01:34:24,680 --> 01:34:27,280
Visitation is only allowed
on the weekend..

1057
01:34:27,720 --> 01:34:29,200
and then only family.

1058
01:34:29,880 --> 01:34:31,920
When will he be discharged?

1059
01:34:32,120 --> 01:34:34,520
I'm afraid that's confidential.

1060
01:34:35,960 --> 01:34:38,360
Perhaps when his
insurance expires?

1061
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:42,360
Do you recognize that man?

1062
01:34:44,120 --> 01:34:45,160
What's his name?

1063
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:48,840
That's the point, I don't know.

1064
01:34:50,360 --> 01:34:51,960
What is his name?

1065
01:34:55,720 --> 01:34:59,000
He works in the oil and gas
section on the 9th floor.

1066
01:35:03,880 --> 01:35:05,560
Morgan.

1067
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:09,080
Yes. Morgan.

1068
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:11,600
His first name's
something like..

1069
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:14,000
Charles, but that's not it.

1070
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,400
I can't tell you
how grateful I am.

1071
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:22,000
When you opened the door..

1072
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:25,080
I thought I was hallucinating.

1073
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:28,360
I'm sorry.

1074
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:32,200
I'll take a hallucination
like that..

1075
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:34,040
anytime.

1076
01:35:36,840 --> 01:35:38,040
Take care of yourself.

1077
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:45,520
Excuse me, miss.
What are you doing?

1078
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:47,760
Visiting my brother.

1079
01:35:47,960 --> 01:35:49,320
Who is your brother?

1080
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:50,520
Edward Linney.

1081
01:35:52,360 --> 01:35:53,600
This your sister?

1082
01:35:59,560 --> 01:36:00,600
Yes.

1083
01:36:01,360 --> 01:36:02,760
Leave her alone.

1084
01:36:04,160 --> 01:36:06,080
Mom will come on the weekend.

1085
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:07,520
Sis?

1086
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:09,720
Come back soon.

1087
01:36:10,040 --> 01:36:11,360
I'll try.

1088
01:36:12,280 --> 01:36:16,160
I know you'd agree with me about the
horrendous cost of health care.

1089
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:17,840
Of course, of course.

1090
01:36:18,120 --> 01:36:21,960
We pride ourselves on our enlightened
policy regarding payment.

1091
01:36:22,200 --> 01:36:24,040
Thank you very much
for your time.

1092
01:36:27,160 --> 01:36:30,840
We'll be happy to have you back on
any of our normal visiting days.

1093
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:37,760
Curtis Morgan, oil and gas.

1094
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:49,880
White & Blazevich, please.

1095
01:36:50,160 --> 01:36:52,280
Second floor. Use the escalator.

1096
01:37:13,080 --> 01:37:14,040
May I help you?

1097
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:16,680
Dorothy Blythe, to
see Curtis Morgan.

1098
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:21,120
Have a seat.
I'll be right with you.

1099
01:37:54,360 --> 01:37:57,480
- You have a meeting with Mr. Morgan?
- Yes. At 5.

1100
01:37:58,040 --> 01:38:00,320
- When was your appointment?
- Two weeks ago.

1101
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:02,040
May I ask why?

1102
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:04,920
Obviously, I need an
oil and gas lawyer.

1103
01:38:06,200 --> 01:38:07,800
Curtis Morgan is dead.

1104
01:38:10,160 --> 01:38:11,320
Why didn't anyone call me?

1105
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:14,400
We have no record of
your appointment.

1106
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:16,480
What happened?

1107
01:38:17,120 --> 01:38:19,320
He was mugged a week ago.

1108
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:21,600
Shot by street
punks, we believe.

1109
01:38:21,880 --> 01:38:23,600
Do you have some identification?

1110
01:38:24,760 --> 01:38:26,000
He's Security.

1111
01:38:26,200 --> 01:38:27,720
Security for what?

1112
01:38:28,680 --> 01:38:31,280
Come with us, you should
see someone else.

1113
01:38:31,480 --> 01:38:35,720
After this treatment, I have no interest
in talking to anyone in this firm.

1114
01:38:52,120 --> 01:38:54,040
They killed him!

1115
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:03,160
I can't breathe!

1116
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,400
It's all right. Just let it go.

1117
01:39:21,680 --> 01:39:22,680
Let it go.

1118
01:39:27,560 --> 01:39:28,800
It's all right.

1119
01:39:36,280 --> 01:39:39,360
We ran the story about a week ago.
It's just another mugging.

1120
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:41,960
Didn't make the
Metro front page.

1121
01:39:42,240 --> 01:39:43,520
Curtis Morgan..

1122
01:39:43,800 --> 01:39:46,200
225 Willow Road, Bethesda.

1123
01:39:46,760 --> 01:39:49,040
225 Willow Road..

1124
01:39:49,560 --> 01:39:51,000
Bethesda.

1125
01:39:51,480 --> 01:39:52,800
That's what I wanted.

1126
01:39:53,120 --> 01:39:56,640
Report in before noon tomorrow.
We're nervous over here.

1127
01:39:57,480 --> 01:39:58,640
You know..

1128
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:00,920
good help is hard to find.

1129
01:40:07,680 --> 01:40:09,240
I'm going with you.

1130
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:14,840
Look at me.

1131
01:40:23,320 --> 01:40:25,080
I want you to leave.

1132
01:40:27,960 --> 01:40:30,680
And if you need confirmation
for your story?

1133
01:40:31,480 --> 01:40:32,760
I'm on my own.

1134
01:40:36,440 --> 01:40:38,360
What's changed your mind?

1135
01:40:42,040 --> 01:40:44,120
I want you to reach 25.

1136
01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:51,920
I'm coming.

1137
01:41:19,160 --> 01:41:20,480
Good evening.

1138
01:41:20,760 --> 01:41:23,160
I'm Grantham of the Herald.
This is my assistant.

1139
01:41:23,400 --> 01:41:27,480
- Could we see Mrs. Morgan?
- I'm her father. She won't talk.

1140
01:41:28,120 --> 01:41:31,400
I respect her privacy. I know
she's been through an ordeal.

1141
01:41:32,280 --> 01:41:35,000
When did you people ever
respect anyone's privacy?

1142
01:41:36,160 --> 01:41:40,280
I feel that way about most reporters.
But her husband called me..

1143
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:42,880
3 times before he died.

1144
01:41:43,320 --> 01:41:45,600
I believe his death
wasn't accidental.

1145
01:41:47,320 --> 01:41:50,000
She doesn't want to talk.
Get the hell out of here.

1146
01:41:53,080 --> 01:41:54,600
You change your mind..

1147
01:41:55,400 --> 01:41:57,120
I'll be at this number.

1148
01:43:02,720 --> 01:43:05,840
Mr. Grantham? Yes.

1149
01:43:06,520 --> 01:43:08,360
This is Mrs. Morgan.

1150
01:43:09,880 --> 01:43:12,280
Do you still want to see me?

1151
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,160
Did you know your
husband called me?

1152
01:43:20,720 --> 01:43:23,640
No. How would he know anything
about those dead judges?

1153
01:43:24,440 --> 01:43:26,480
I have no idea.

1154
01:43:27,480 --> 01:43:29,120
Did he keep any..

1155
01:43:29,400 --> 01:43:31,360
unusual documents..

1156
01:43:31,640 --> 01:43:32,720
or papers?

1157
01:43:34,200 --> 01:43:37,400
We have a lock box at the
bank for deed and wills.

1158
01:43:38,840 --> 01:43:42,560
I looked at it last Thursday.
There was nothing unusual in it.

1159
01:43:44,440 --> 01:43:46,200
On Saturday morning..

1160
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:48,440
I was going through his..

1161
01:43:50,200 --> 01:43:52,200
desk in the bedroom.

1162
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:55,400
I found something a bit unusual.

1163
01:43:57,560 --> 01:43:58,560
A key.

1164
01:44:00,760 --> 01:44:01,800
A key to what?

1165
01:44:03,640 --> 01:44:05,280
Another lock box.

1166
01:44:07,160 --> 01:44:08,240
Which bank?

1167
01:44:09,720 --> 01:44:11,400
Riggs Bank.

1168
01:44:14,840 --> 01:44:16,440
We've never banked there.

1169
01:44:17,160 --> 01:44:19,400
And you knew nothing
about this other..

1170
01:44:20,160 --> 01:44:21,200
box?

1171
01:44:21,360 --> 01:44:23,000
Not until Saturday morning.

1172
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:25,280
I figured..

1173
01:44:26,040 --> 01:44:28,320
I'll run by when
I felt up to it.

1174
01:44:29,560 --> 01:44:31,640
Maybe you should check
it, Mrs. Morgan.

1175
01:44:34,040 --> 01:44:36,080
Could be a clue to
who killed him.

1176
01:44:37,400 --> 01:44:39,920
Are you saying
Curtis was killed..

1177
01:44:40,120 --> 01:44:43,040
because he knew something
about the assassinations?

1178
01:44:43,320 --> 01:44:45,400
That's exactly what I'm saying.

1179
01:44:46,360 --> 01:44:50,960
Do you think there may be papers
in the safe-deposit box..

1180
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:54,600
that may reveal what Curtis
knew about the assassinations?

1181
01:44:55,160 --> 01:44:56,960
There could be.

1182
01:44:59,520 --> 01:45:01,720
My child's lost one parent.

1183
01:45:05,720 --> 01:45:07,560
I can't let her lose another.

1184
01:45:10,040 --> 01:45:11,480
I'll check it for you.

1185
01:45:12,200 --> 01:45:14,200
No one has to know
you have the key.

1186
01:45:18,600 --> 01:45:20,920
They will only give
it to his wife.

1187
01:45:21,200 --> 01:45:23,520
My partner's a woman.
She's trustworthy.

1188
01:45:25,240 --> 01:45:26,720
I would have one condition.

1189
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:31,560
If you find something that disparages
my husband in any way, you can't use it.

1190
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:34,440
You have my word, Mrs. Morgan.

1191
01:47:05,560 --> 01:47:07,280
Where are the
safe-deposit boxes?

1192
01:47:07,480 --> 01:47:08,720
Down those steps.

1193
01:48:26,840 --> 01:48:28,760
I need access to a box, please.

1194
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
- The number, please?
- 616.

1195
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:37,760
- This box was rented two weeks ago.
- Yes.

1196
01:48:38,040 --> 01:48:40,800
- I assume you're Mrs. Morgan?
- Sara Ann Morgan.

1197
01:48:41,120 --> 01:48:43,760
- The address?
- 225 Willow Road, Bethesda.

1198
01:48:45,080 --> 01:48:48,480
- Phone number?
- 301-555-7128.

1199
01:48:49,240 --> 01:48:50,680
Who rented this box?

1200
01:48:50,880 --> 01:48:53,560
- My husband, Curtis D. Morgan.
- And his social security number?

1201
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,320
510-96-8686.

1202
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:04,600
Will you sign here, please?

1203
01:49:05,280 --> 01:49:06,320
May I help you?

1204
01:49:06,520 --> 01:49:08,320
I'd like to rent a box.

1205
01:49:08,600 --> 01:49:11,480
Will you have a seat? I'll
be with you in a minute.

1206
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:14,240
You have a key?

1207
01:49:14,520 --> 01:49:15,800
Yes, I do.

1208
01:49:17,880 --> 01:49:19,160
Follow me.

1209
01:50:56,120 --> 01:50:58,040
It's a four-page affidavit..

1210
01:50:58,280 --> 01:51:00,760
signed under oath.

1211
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:03,960
It's dated the day before
the last time he called me.

1212
01:51:06,680 --> 01:51:11,320
He worked at White & Blazevich in
the oil and gas section for 5 years.

1213
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:13,640
Listen to this!

1214
01:51:13,880 --> 01:51:15,160
During that time..

1215
01:51:15,440 --> 01:51:19,800
he worked for a client who was
engaged in a lawsuit in Louisiana.

1216
01:51:20,040 --> 01:51:23,000
The client was a man
named Victor Mattiece..

1217
01:51:23,320 --> 01:51:24,760
who he's never met.

1218
01:51:25,080 --> 01:51:28,880
Lots about the lawsuit, how
desperate Mattiece was to win it.

1219
01:51:29,080 --> 01:51:30,680
Just as if you wrote it.

1220
01:51:32,440 --> 01:51:35,320
A partner named Sims Wakefield..

1221
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:39,560
supervised the case for W & B. Morgan
worked on a peripherated case.

1222
01:51:39,960 --> 01:51:43,360
He took files and documents
that Wakefield left for him..

1223
01:51:43,640 --> 01:51:45,200
not related to the case.

1224
01:51:45,400 --> 01:51:49,880
When he got back to his own office, he
found a memo on the bottom of the stack.

1225
01:51:50,080 --> 01:51:53,080
He'd inadvertently taken
it from Wakefield's desk.

1226
01:51:53,360 --> 01:51:56,120
A copy of the memo is
attached to the affidavit.

1227
01:51:56,480 --> 01:52:00,760
He copied the memo and left the
memo under the files on his desk.

1228
01:52:00,960 --> 01:52:03,160
Next stop, Washington Herald!

1229
01:52:05,720 --> 01:52:07,480
No! Stop! Get out of the car!

1230
01:55:14,360 --> 01:55:17,960
There was a car explosion
in a garage near the Riggs Bank.

1231
01:55:18,320 --> 01:55:21,240
The police traced the car
to a leasing agency.

1232
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,440
It was rented yesterday
by Grantham.

1233
01:55:26,760 --> 01:55:28,760
Have you heard from Grantham?

1234
01:55:29,760 --> 01:55:31,480
Not since yesterday.

1235
01:55:33,400 --> 01:55:35,000
I should've taken
him off that story.

1236
01:55:35,960 --> 01:55:36,920
What story?

1237
01:55:40,120 --> 01:55:41,880
See what you can find.

1238
01:56:02,280 --> 01:56:03,560
Smith Keen..

1239
01:56:04,120 --> 01:56:05,720
meet Darby Shaw.

1240
01:56:07,720 --> 01:56:09,520
So, Mr. Grantham..

1241
01:56:09,680 --> 01:56:11,480
what the hell is going on?

1242
01:56:21,240 --> 01:56:24,080
Sweetheart, I'm down
here in the basement.

1243
01:56:25,640 --> 01:56:27,680
It's about two in the morning.

1244
01:56:30,200 --> 01:56:31,400
This is..

1245
01:56:32,240 --> 01:56:33,240
an affidavit..

1246
01:56:35,800 --> 01:56:38,360
concerning a memo I
found on my desk.

1247
01:56:39,760 --> 01:56:43,440
I'm going to trust you to
do with it what you will.

1248
01:56:44,440 --> 01:56:47,640
The memo's from Velmano,
he's a senior partner.

1249
01:56:50,400 --> 01:56:53,400
It was dated September 28th..

1250
01:56:54,680 --> 01:56:57,360
addressed to Wakefield
and it read:

1251
01:56:57,560 --> 01:57:00,080
"Sims, advise client
research is complete."

1252
01:57:00,760 --> 01:57:04,440
The bench will sit much softer
if the old man is retired.

1253
01:57:05,240 --> 01:57:08,640
The second retirement is a bit unusual.
Jensen, of all people.

1254
01:57:09,560 --> 01:57:12,920
Advise further that the pelican
should arrive here in 4 years..

1255
01:57:13,160 --> 01:57:15,160
"assuming other factors."

1256
01:57:16,080 --> 01:57:17,360
There's no signature.

1257
01:57:18,440 --> 01:57:21,320
Then Justices Rosenberg
and Jensen were killed.

1258
01:57:24,080 --> 01:57:27,440
I firmly believe that this is the
work of Mattiece & his associates.

1259
01:57:27,760 --> 01:57:30,440
Memo doesn't mention Mattiece,
but it refers to a client.

1260
01:57:30,680 --> 01:57:32,760
Wakefield had no other clients.

1261
01:57:33,120 --> 01:57:35,520
And no client had as much
to gain from the new court.

1262
01:57:37,880 --> 01:57:42,160
I thought that I was protecting
us by not revealing what I found.

1263
01:57:43,160 --> 01:57:46,280
You'll only see this if I'm
gone, so I will have failed.

1264
01:57:48,440 --> 01:57:49,920
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

1265
01:57:54,640 --> 01:57:56,400
I'll always be with you.

1266
01:57:58,560 --> 01:57:59,760
Always.

1267
01:58:02,680 --> 01:58:06,240
This is Marty Velmano. What a pleasure!
What can I do for you?

1268
01:58:07,040 --> 01:58:09,720
We're doing a story
about Victor Mattiece..

1269
01:58:10,680 --> 01:58:14,640
and his involvement in the
deaths of Rosenberg and Jensen.

1270
01:58:15,120 --> 01:58:19,520
Great! We'll sue you for the next 20 years.
You'll be named as a defendant.

1271
01:58:19,800 --> 01:58:21,800
Oh, this will be great.

1272
01:58:22,040 --> 01:58:24,440
Victor Mattiece will
own the Herald.

1273
01:58:24,680 --> 01:58:28,440
Have you heard of the Pelican Brief?
We have a copy of it.

1274
01:58:29,080 --> 01:58:32,840
We also have a copy of a memo
sent by you to Sims Wakefield..

1275
01:58:33,080 --> 01:58:37,400
in which you suggest your client's
position would be greatly improved..

1276
01:58:37,680 --> 01:58:41,520
by the removal of Rosenberg
and Jensen from the court.

1277
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:44,280
I noticed you waited till five.

1278
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:47,520
An hour earlier, we could've
run to court, stopped this.

1279
01:58:48,080 --> 01:58:49,920
You deny you wrote the memo?

1280
01:58:53,200 --> 01:58:55,120
It's a fabrication.

1281
01:58:55,880 --> 01:58:58,080
You have no lawsuit,
Mr. Velmano.

1282
01:58:58,840 --> 01:59:00,120
You know it.

1283
01:59:00,480 --> 01:59:02,040
You son of a bitch!

1284
01:59:05,080 --> 01:59:06,480
Mr. Coal?

1285
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:09,800
Have you read the Pelican Brief?
I have.

1286
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:14,200
We're running a story which verifies
the facts set forth in that brief.

1287
01:59:14,480 --> 01:59:17,520
We've confirmed Mattiece
contributed over $4 million..

1288
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:19,640
to the president's
last campaign.

1289
01:59:19,920 --> 01:59:22,160
4,200,000, all through
legal channels.

1290
01:59:22,360 --> 01:59:23,400
That's right.

1291
01:59:23,560 --> 01:59:27,640
We believe the White House tried to
obstruct the FBI investigation..

1292
01:59:27,920 --> 01:59:30,480
and we wonder if there
are any comments.

1293
01:59:30,680 --> 01:59:33,800
The White House denies any
direct or indirect involvement..

1294
01:59:34,080 --> 01:59:36,240
in this investigation.

1295
01:59:36,920 --> 01:59:39,160
You've received some
bad information.

1296
01:59:46,760 --> 01:59:48,800
Mr. Voyles, it's Grantham.

1297
01:59:50,160 --> 01:59:52,760
We're running a story
detailing a conspiracy..

1298
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,160
in the murders of
Rosenberg and Jensen.

1299
01:59:55,440 --> 01:59:59,320
We're naming Mattiece, an oil
speculator, and two of his lawyers.

1300
01:59:59,640 --> 02:00:03,360
We believe the FBI knew about
Mattiece, but didn't investigate..

1301
02:00:03,640 --> 02:00:07,000
at the urging of the White House.
Any comments?

1302
02:01:16,240 --> 02:01:19,200
I think we'll have great
success with these people.

1303
02:01:19,480 --> 02:01:22,040
They were really very pleased..

1304
02:01:22,360 --> 02:01:24,600
and genuinely cooperative.

1305
02:01:25,160 --> 02:01:26,360
What's up?

1306
02:02:08,640 --> 02:02:09,800
You know Gray Grantham.

1307
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:13,840
And this is Darby Shaw.

1308
02:02:21,600 --> 02:02:24,680
So you're the little lady who
started this great brouhaha.

1309
02:02:26,160 --> 02:02:29,240
I think you have me confused
with the president's friend.

1310
02:02:30,440 --> 02:02:33,880
I have some comments,
for the record.

1311
02:02:42,480 --> 02:02:45,080
First, we got the Pelican
Brief two weeks ago..

1312
02:02:45,360 --> 02:02:48,120
and submitted it to the White
House on the same day.

1313
02:02:48,320 --> 02:02:53,040
It was not considered high priority in
the investigation until Gavin Verheek..

1314
02:02:53,360 --> 02:02:56,280
Special Counsel to the
Director, was found murdered.

1315
02:02:56,480 --> 02:02:59,480
Did the White House interfere in
the FBI investigation of Mattiece?

1316
02:03:00,920 --> 02:03:02,600
I'll discuss it..

1317
02:03:02,840 --> 02:03:04,080
off the record.

1318
02:03:11,640 --> 02:03:16,120
Last Wednesday the president asked me
to ignore Victor Mattiece as a suspect.

1319
02:03:16,400 --> 02:03:17,880
In his words..

1320
02:03:18,480 --> 02:03:20,240
he asked me to "back off."

1321
02:03:21,120 --> 02:03:22,520
I have a tape..

1322
02:03:23,040 --> 02:03:25,400
which I will allow
no one to hear..

1323
02:03:25,640 --> 02:03:28,440
unless the president
first denies this.

1324
02:03:29,240 --> 02:03:30,680
So what do you do now?

1325
02:03:31,880 --> 02:03:35,720
There'll be a grand jury by noon
tomorrow. Quick indictments.

1326
02:03:37,040 --> 02:03:39,120
And we'll find Mattiece.

1327
02:03:41,400 --> 02:03:44,240
I'd like a few minutes
alone with Ms. Shaw.

1328
02:03:44,920 --> 02:03:46,640
If she doesn't mind.
It's her call.

1329
02:03:46,840 --> 02:03:48,680
I'd like Mr. Grantham to stay.

1330
02:04:08,600 --> 02:04:10,080
What's next for you?

1331
02:04:11,120 --> 02:04:13,520
Who killed the man
disguised as Verheek?

1332
02:04:13,720 --> 02:04:16,400
Oh, you mean the
assassin, Khamel.

1333
02:04:17,240 --> 02:04:20,120
Off the record, Khamel was
killed by a contract operative..

1334
02:04:20,400 --> 02:04:22,320
hired independently by the CIA.

1335
02:04:23,320 --> 02:04:24,320
Rupert?

1336
02:04:24,600 --> 02:04:26,200
He probably has 20 names.

1337
02:04:26,400 --> 02:04:27,600
Why was he following her?

1338
02:04:28,760 --> 02:04:32,440
I think the brief initially
scared Giminski more than anyone.

1339
02:04:32,640 --> 02:04:34,080
And he probably..

1340
02:04:34,360 --> 02:04:35,400
sent Rupert..

1341
02:04:35,560 --> 02:04:37,400
to trail Darby..

1342
02:04:37,680 --> 02:04:40,760
in part to watch, and
in part to protect.

1343
02:04:43,680 --> 02:04:47,000
We can help. What do you want?

1344
02:04:49,360 --> 02:04:51,160
To leave the country, alone.

1345
02:04:54,200 --> 02:04:55,280
All right.

1346
02:04:55,800 --> 02:04:58,560
We'll get you out of here,
put you on my plane.

1347
02:04:58,880 --> 02:05:01,360
We'll fly you anywhere you
want and you can disappear.

1348
02:05:01,640 --> 02:05:04,120
But you must allow
me to contact you..

1349
02:05:04,640 --> 02:05:05,880
through Mr. Grantham..

1350
02:05:06,160 --> 02:05:09,520
if, and only if, it becomes
urgently necessary.

1351
02:05:11,640 --> 02:05:12,880
That's fine.

1352
02:05:15,480 --> 02:05:18,640
I want no one on the plane
but me, Gray and the pilots.

1353
02:05:19,880 --> 02:05:22,320
After takeoff, I'll tell
the pilot where to go.

1354
02:05:22,960 --> 02:05:26,040
He has to file a flight
plan before he can leave.

1355
02:05:26,720 --> 02:05:29,040
You're the director of the FBI.

1356
02:05:30,040 --> 02:05:31,400
Set it up.

1357
02:09:17,680 --> 02:09:19,600
Our guest today is
Gray Grantham..

1358
02:09:19,880 --> 02:09:22,680
who has, as just about
everyone in America knows..

1359
02:09:23,040 --> 02:09:27,680
revealed the plot behind the
assassinations of Rosenberg & Jensen.

1360
02:09:28,040 --> 02:09:31,520
The ripple effects of this
story just don't seem to stop.

1361
02:09:31,800 --> 02:09:35,760
As of this broadcast, Victor Mattiece,
one of the country's richest men..

1362
02:09:35,960 --> 02:09:39,280
has been indicted, along
with 4 aides and lawyers.

1363
02:09:39,680 --> 02:09:43,640
Fletcher Coal, the president's
Chief of Staff, has resigned.

1364
02:09:43,880 --> 02:09:47,320
And we're getting strong indications
that the president himself..

1365
02:09:47,520 --> 02:09:48,920
will not run again.

1366
02:09:49,560 --> 02:09:52,280
That's what we know.
Let's get to what we don't.

1367
02:09:53,600 --> 02:09:57,720
We know the Pelican Brief was written
by a woman named Darby Shaw..

1368
02:09:57,920 --> 02:10:00,120
but we don't know who that is.

1369
02:10:00,320 --> 02:10:02,240
Who is Darby Shaw?

1370
02:10:04,600 --> 02:10:07,120
That's a question for Darby Shaw.

1371
02:10:07,320 --> 02:10:11,760
Next question. Speaking for
many of our colleagues..

1372
02:10:12,080 --> 02:10:14,680
who are in a feeding
frenzy to interview her..

1373
02:10:14,960 --> 02:10:16,640
where is Darby Shaw?

1374
02:10:16,920 --> 02:10:21,080
That's also a question for Darby Shaw.
But she's not available..

1375
02:10:21,360 --> 02:10:23,800
to answer questions until
the feeding frenzy stops.

1376
02:10:24,600 --> 02:10:27,440
Does that mean you don't
know where she is?

1377
02:10:28,520 --> 02:10:29,680
I didn't say that.

1378
02:10:29,960 --> 02:10:31,200
Then you do know.

1379
02:10:35,240 --> 02:10:37,400
I take it this cryptic
smile means..

1380
02:10:37,640 --> 02:10:39,160
you're not answering.

1381
02:10:41,400 --> 02:10:44,560
In view of all this,
you know that..

1382
02:10:45,320 --> 02:10:46,680
there's speculation..

1383
02:10:46,880 --> 02:10:50,360
that this woman is a figment
of your imagination.

1384
02:10:50,640 --> 02:10:54,200
That you created her from a
lot of different sources.

1385
02:10:55,120 --> 02:10:58,280
Just as there are people who
believe there was no Deep Throat..

1386
02:10:58,520 --> 02:11:01,680
there are those who believe
there is no Darby Shaw.

1387
02:11:01,880 --> 02:11:05,240
In other words, she's
just too good to be true.

1388
02:11:06,440 --> 02:11:07,920
She almost is.

1389
02:11:08,800 --> 02:11:13,000
