1
00:00:32,789 --> 00:00:34,154
Cambodia.

2
00:00:35,392 --> 00:00:38,122
To many Westerners,
it seemed a paradise.

3
00:00:38,328 --> 00:00:41,491
Another world, a secret world.

4
00:00:41,798 --> 00:00:45,734
But the war in neighboring
Vietnam burst its borders...

5
00:00:45,936 --> 00:00:49,463
...and the fighting soon spread
to neutral Cambodia.

6
00:00:50,407 --> 00:00:53,604
In 1973, I went to cover
this sideshow struggle...

7
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:56,904
...as foreign correspondent
of The New York Times.

8
00:00:57,281 --> 00:01:00,045
It was there, amidst the fighting...

9
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:03,583
...between government troops
and the Khmer Rouge guerrillas...

10
00:01:03,787 --> 00:01:07,382
...that I met my guide
and interpreter, Dith Pran...

11
00:01:07,591 --> 00:01:10,583
...a man who was to change my life...

12
00:01:10,794 --> 00:01:13,763
...in a country that I grew to love
and pity.

13
00:01:22,973 --> 00:01:25,771
So here we go
with Voice of America...

14
00:01:25,976 --> 00:01:27,967
...news for Southeast Asia.

15
00:01:28,178 --> 00:01:32,308
It's 6:45 and a partly cloudy
morning here.

16
00:01:32,516 --> 00:01:34,780
Clouds too in Washington.

17
00:01:34,985 --> 00:01:38,751
President Nixon announced he'll
address the nation on Watergate...

18
00:01:38,956 --> 00:01:40,821
...within the next few days.

19
00:01:41,024 --> 00:01:43,652
The speech will be Nixon's
first since May.

20
00:01:45,495 --> 00:01:49,522
The scandal has caused resignations
and paralyzed the White House staff.

21
00:01:49,733 --> 00:01:53,328
It has also led to intense
confrontation and perhaps...

22
00:01:53,537 --> 00:01:56,404
...a constitutional crisis
with Senate investigators...

23
00:01:56,607 --> 00:01:59,235
...and a special
Watergate prosecutor.

24
00:01:59,443 --> 00:02:02,810
The speech was announced
after the Gallup Poll disclosed...

25
00:02:03,013 --> 00:02:06,881
...that Mr. Nixon's popularity
had fallen to the lowest point...

26
00:02:07,084 --> 00:02:09,882
...for an American President
in 20 years.

27
00:02:21,698 --> 00:02:24,462
A Supreme Court judge,
William O. Douglas...

28
00:02:24,668 --> 00:02:27,637
...has ruled against an appeal
by the Administration...

29
00:02:27,838 --> 00:02:29,499
...for a stay of the injunction...

30
00:02:29,706 --> 00:02:33,198
...on further U.S. Bombing
missions in Cambodia.

31
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:36,402
Congress has already ruled
these bombings illegal...

32
00:02:36,613 --> 00:02:40,879
...and they should cease in one
week's time on August the 15th.

33
00:03:02,339 --> 00:03:04,330
Let's go, Sarun!
To the hospital!

34
00:03:23,293 --> 00:03:25,420
Information. Information.

35
00:03:25,629 --> 00:03:30,566
Air Cambodia regret delays of arrival
of flight number 125...

36
00:03:30,767 --> 00:03:34,396
...from Bangkok because
of bad weather.

37
00:03:55,826 --> 00:03:57,953
Mister, you want taxi?

38
00:03:58,161 --> 00:04:00,425
Mister, you want taxi?
Good taxi.

39
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:31,018
Shut the fucking blinds, will you?

40
00:04:35,432 --> 00:04:37,093
What's all this shit?

41
00:04:40,137 --> 00:04:41,536
I'm sorry.

42
00:04:42,339 --> 00:04:45,706
I thought you were the houseboy.
I was developing some film.

43
00:04:46,209 --> 00:04:49,770
If you're gonna yell, I'll come back.
I'm not feeling good.

44
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,414
Don't want to yell.
I want to be in a good mood.

45
00:04:52,616 --> 00:04:55,551
The plane was late, no car.
I had to take a taxi here.

46
00:04:55,752 --> 00:04:58,118
All I want to do is work.
I got you.

47
00:05:08,098 --> 00:05:10,430
What the fuck is that on your head?

48
00:05:12,936 --> 00:05:16,428
It's a sanitary napkin.
I had it soaked in ice.

49
00:05:18,074 --> 00:05:20,736
Syd Schanberg.
Is Pran there?

50
00:05:22,612 --> 00:05:24,739
No, I just came from the airport.

51
00:05:25,682 --> 00:05:28,674
Well, if he comes in,
would you tell him I'm here?

52
00:05:29,019 --> 00:05:31,510
I'll be at the Café Central, tell him.

53
00:05:31,988 --> 00:05:32,977
Thanks a lot.

54
00:05:50,841 --> 00:05:52,035
What do you want to eat?

55
00:05:54,144 --> 00:05:55,008
Want some eggs?

56
00:05:55,212 --> 00:05:58,739
I can't. Somebody told me they faint
with fright when you cook them.

57
00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:01,179
- What do you want to eat?
- What are you having?

58
00:06:01,384 --> 00:06:02,942
I'm having a café complet.

59
00:06:03,587 --> 00:06:05,953
I'll have that. And some aspirin.

60
00:06:13,697 --> 00:06:17,258
Anything I eat has got to be
absolutely dead.

61
00:06:17,467 --> 00:06:19,367
That's why I can never eat an oyster.

62
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:22,905
I read somewhere that they put...

63
00:06:25,242 --> 00:06:28,871
...that lemon juice on them
just to stun them. You know?

64
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:30,239
What's the difference?

65
00:06:31,715 --> 00:06:36,152
An unconscious oyster's just as
horrible as the fucker wide awake...

66
00:06:50,467 --> 00:06:52,867
- My God! Look at this.
- Did you see that?

67
00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:54,400
What was it? A rocket?

68
00:06:54,604 --> 00:06:57,300
I don't know.
I saw a guy on a motorbike.

69
00:07:06,182 --> 00:07:07,615
I've been looking for you.

70
00:07:07,817 --> 00:07:09,375
I left a message for you.

71
00:07:09,586 --> 00:07:11,611
I didn't get it. I took a cab.

72
00:07:11,821 --> 00:07:14,756
- There is a big accident right now.
- What?

73
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:18,325
I think U.S. Drop many big bombs
on little city.

74
00:07:18,828 --> 00:07:21,854
- U.S. Bombs? You're sure?
- I think many dead.

75
00:07:22,065 --> 00:07:24,556
- Does anybody else know about it?
- Nothing at all.

76
00:07:25,535 --> 00:07:26,593
We're going.

77
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:29,361
Not possible right now, Sydney.
Too dangerous.

78
00:07:57,734 --> 00:07:59,531
Where you going, Schanberg?

79
00:08:01,104 --> 00:08:02,537
Neak Luong.

80
00:08:02,739 --> 00:08:04,001
Neak Luong's closed.

81
00:08:04,207 --> 00:08:07,973
Don't give me that, Reeves.
You got nothing to say about this.

82
00:08:08,178 --> 00:08:11,670
I got a right to go wherever I like
in this sad little country.

83
00:08:11,881 --> 00:08:16,784
That's the law. You impede me, you're
breaking the Cooper/Church Amendment!

84
00:08:16,987 --> 00:08:19,854
Well, up the Cooper/Church
Amendment's ass!

85
00:08:22,425 --> 00:08:23,585
Let's go!

86
00:08:34,537 --> 00:08:36,630
So how can I help you, Mr. Schanberg?

87
00:08:40,677 --> 00:08:45,580
I'm looking for information on why
my airplane was delayed this morning.

88
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:49,111
- Your plane was delayed?
- That's right.

89
00:08:49,319 --> 00:08:52,618
I don't know. Maybe it's
bad weather. Your flight's...

90
00:08:52,822 --> 00:08:54,881
You don't know anything about it?

91
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:56,683
No, I don't.

92
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,149
All right.

93
00:08:59,996 --> 00:09:02,487
Then I'd like you
to listen to something...

94
00:09:02,699 --> 00:09:04,724
...and then I'd like a comment.

95
00:09:05,101 --> 00:09:08,798
This morning, for reasons beyond
anybody's control...

96
00:09:09,005 --> 00:09:13,101
...I spend two hours in Bangkok
staring at a seat belt sign.

97
00:09:13,309 --> 00:09:14,867
Meanwhile, my sources tell me...

98
00:09:15,078 --> 00:09:18,878
...two Army helicopters are landing
here, just across the airfield.

99
00:09:19,449 --> 00:09:22,714
Half the ambulances in Phnom Penh
are waiting there to meet them.

100
00:09:23,119 --> 00:09:27,283
And now there's a rumor that
the U.S. Air Force dropped a bomb...

101
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:29,390
...or several bombs, on Neak Luong.

102
00:09:29,592 --> 00:09:32,755
That's a rumor, and I'm not gonna
comment on a rumor.

103
00:09:32,962 --> 00:09:37,023
I just want to know if that's the
reason why my airplane was delayed!

104
00:09:40,904 --> 00:09:41,871
No comment.

105
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:43,999
How many killed?

106
00:09:47,077 --> 00:09:48,374
How many wounded?

107
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:56,680
Thank you for your cooperation,
Major Reeves.

108
00:09:58,955 --> 00:10:03,187
When I scrape this story out, I will
no doubt be quoting you in full!

109
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:47,195
I'm sorry.

110
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:49,738
This is just not good enough.

111
00:10:49,939 --> 00:10:51,930
This is a big story...

112
00:10:52,142 --> 00:10:56,374
...a major story, you understand that?
We've got to get down there!

113
00:10:56,579 --> 00:10:58,672
- I know, but...
- I don't want to hear "no"!

114
00:10:58,882 --> 00:11:00,873
I want to get down that river!

115
00:11:01,084 --> 00:11:02,813
We should be down there now!

116
00:11:15,198 --> 00:11:16,529
I'll be here.

117
00:11:19,102 --> 00:11:20,592
Good night, Sydney.

118
00:11:29,712 --> 00:11:31,475
- Messages?
- No, sir.

119
00:11:32,015 --> 00:11:33,004
No, sir.

120
00:11:35,051 --> 00:11:38,282
I'd talk, but it's been
a heavy day and I've got to go.

121
00:11:38,488 --> 00:11:40,956
Let's get together again soon, okay?

122
00:11:41,157 --> 00:11:42,522
- Bob?
- See you.

123
00:11:42,992 --> 00:11:43,959
Bob?

124
00:11:45,061 --> 00:11:47,052
Hello, Sydney. Good night, Sydney.

125
00:11:47,263 --> 00:11:50,460
- Listen, I can't talk with you.
- You can talk to me.

126
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:53,636
The embassy is jittery.
Get information from a press officer.

127
00:11:53,836 --> 00:11:56,134
Let's not start insulting each other.

128
00:11:58,441 --> 00:12:00,068
Good night, Sydney.

129
00:12:00,977 --> 00:12:02,444
All right, good night.

130
00:12:07,917 --> 00:12:09,782
You've heard of pilot error?

131
00:12:09,986 --> 00:12:11,476
Computer malfunction?

132
00:12:11,921 --> 00:12:13,821
They screwed up on the coordinates.

133
00:12:14,023 --> 00:12:17,789
A single B-52 dropped
its entire load on Neak Luong.

134
00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:22,225
There's a homing beacon
in the middle of the town.

135
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:25,824
- Casualties?
- You'll be briefed tomorrow.

136
00:12:26,035 --> 00:12:30,734
We estimate 55 military,
something like 35 civilians.

137
00:12:32,175 --> 00:12:33,403
How many?

138
00:12:35,812 --> 00:12:38,610
I hear it's in the hundreds.
Don't quote me on that.

139
00:12:38,815 --> 00:12:42,080
Will there be a dreadful bloodbath

140
00:12:42,285 --> 00:12:45,379
When the Khmer Rouge hit the town?

141
00:12:45,855 --> 00:12:48,551
Will there be a dreadful bloodbath...?

142
00:12:51,261 --> 00:12:53,456
Beer! We haven't had this
for four weeks.

143
00:12:53,863 --> 00:12:55,763
New York Times probably
had it flown in.

144
00:12:56,366 --> 00:12:59,767
- They keep it in their suite.
- We got a cellar. Don't you know?

145
00:12:59,969 --> 00:13:02,437
Americans take themselves so seriously.

146
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:07,440
Don't be hard on the man. He's just
trying to get to the top of the heap.

147
00:13:07,644 --> 00:13:11,239
We'll just have to pay more to get
our telexes to the top of the heap.

148
00:13:11,447 --> 00:13:13,972
The man has just bought you a beer.
Now drink up.

149
00:13:14,183 --> 00:13:15,241
- Cheers.
- Cheers, Syd.

150
00:13:15,451 --> 00:13:17,442
- Enjoy it.
- Off to see the telex operator?

151
00:13:17,654 --> 00:13:20,054
- New York Times goes to bed early.
- Sure!

152
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,555
Khmer Rouge in the sunset

153
00:13:25,962 --> 00:13:28,396
The Yanks all at sea...

154
00:13:32,235 --> 00:13:34,328
- All right?
- Very possible.

155
00:13:35,505 --> 00:13:36,972
Let's go then!

156
00:13:44,981 --> 00:13:46,471
This is good work.

157
00:14:23,119 --> 00:14:24,677
- How much?
- Hundred fifty.

158
00:14:32,028 --> 00:14:33,017
One hundred!

159
00:14:39,068 --> 00:14:40,535
- All right?
- All right.

160
00:14:48,378 --> 00:14:50,073
Nice going, Pran.

161
00:15:48,838 --> 00:15:51,500
- What is he saying?
- He wants you to look at his family.

162
00:15:51,707 --> 00:15:56,144
To take a photograph and help him
because his child was wounded.

163
00:16:22,672 --> 00:16:24,765
Tell me what she's saying.

164
00:16:27,076 --> 00:16:28,566
She needs help.

165
00:16:32,515 --> 00:16:35,143
Her shop was destroyed last night.

166
00:16:36,352 --> 00:16:37,785
Her husband killed.

167
00:16:37,987 --> 00:16:39,215
How many bombs?

168
00:16:41,157 --> 00:16:42,419
She doesn't know.

169
00:16:43,526 --> 00:16:45,551
Does she know where the hospital is?

170
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:48,661
"Just over there."

171
00:16:54,971 --> 00:16:57,201
She wants to know,
"Did someone arrest the pilot?"

172
00:16:59,842 --> 00:17:02,640
Mister, you wanna buy?
Mister, you wanna buy?

173
00:17:03,012 --> 00:17:06,243
- One dollar? You wanna buy?
- I'm out of film. I'm sorry.

174
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:10,385
Ask her how many kids she's got
in her family.

175
00:17:11,654 --> 00:17:12,518
"Five."

176
00:17:12,989 --> 00:17:15,423
Her husband was killed already.

177
00:17:19,729 --> 00:17:20,991
What's this?

178
00:17:21,464 --> 00:17:23,227
What are these guys over here?

179
00:17:28,571 --> 00:17:31,472
In the jeep, prisoners.
Khmer Rouge prisoners.

180
00:17:54,597 --> 00:17:56,588
They kill a lot of villagers.

181
00:17:56,966 --> 00:17:59,526
She says Khmer Rouge soak rags
in gasoline...

182
00:17:59,735 --> 00:18:01,760
...and push them down
villagers' throat...

183
00:18:01,971 --> 00:18:03,962
...then set the rags alight.

184
00:18:04,206 --> 00:18:05,366
Film! No film!

185
00:18:05,575 --> 00:18:07,065
I know there's no film.

186
00:18:07,276 --> 00:18:08,402
No camera!

187
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:10,737
No camera!

188
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,274
It's all right.

189
00:18:15,251 --> 00:18:16,684
Just take it easy.

190
00:18:22,658 --> 00:18:24,216
Tell them we're jour...

191
00:18:33,903 --> 00:18:35,302
Come on! Get in!

192
00:19:19,482 --> 00:19:21,109
I'm worried.

193
00:19:22,551 --> 00:19:24,951
I'm the guy who bring you over here.

194
00:19:25,721 --> 00:19:27,951
They accuse me and they arrest me.

195
00:19:28,524 --> 00:19:31,015
How can they arrest you?
You're already arrested.

196
00:19:32,528 --> 00:19:34,519
They phone Phnom Penh about me.

197
00:19:43,873 --> 00:19:45,363
I want some cigarettes.

198
00:19:47,543 --> 00:19:49,010
And I need to take a leak.

199
00:19:52,181 --> 00:19:54,172
Would you tell them I need to piss?

200
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,830
He said, "No piss."

201
00:20:21,677 --> 00:20:22,803
What does that mean?

202
00:20:23,345 --> 00:20:25,210
That's no piss.

203
00:20:29,719 --> 00:20:31,949
I've had enough of this bullshit.

204
00:20:32,621 --> 00:20:34,612
I got a story to get to New York!

205
00:20:39,862 --> 00:20:41,159
Don't leave me!

206
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:53,303
I won't leave you.

207
00:22:02,144 --> 00:22:04,544
They brought in the whole press corps!

208
00:22:04,747 --> 00:22:08,080
They want to sanitize the story!
Bastards!

209
00:22:18,527 --> 00:22:20,654
I am going to tell you something.

210
00:22:20,896 --> 00:22:22,557
I'm walking out of here.

211
00:22:22,765 --> 00:22:25,097
What are you gonna do?
Blow my head off?

212
00:22:25,367 --> 00:22:28,359
You got a general out there,
this is an American passport...

213
00:22:28,571 --> 00:22:30,505
...and I am walking out of here!

214
00:22:33,275 --> 00:22:36,540
- He wants to get higher officer.
- Then get him! Get him!

215
00:22:44,954 --> 00:22:49,084
I'm sorry we couldn't show you the
minor bomb damage in the city itself.

216
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:51,088
It's still a restricted area.

217
00:22:51,293 --> 00:22:53,557
Now, if you look across the river...

218
00:22:53,762 --> 00:22:56,697
...you'll see positions held by
Khmer Rouge...

219
00:22:56,899 --> 00:22:58,696
...who moved in over
the past few days.

220
00:22:58,901 --> 00:23:02,132
But the Cambodian Republican Army
is moving in on them.

221
00:23:02,338 --> 00:23:05,830
They'll have the K.R. Out
before you can say "Jack Robinson."

222
00:23:06,742 --> 00:23:08,437
Get in the chopper now!

223
00:23:08,744 --> 00:23:12,202
No, Schanberg! You came on a boat,
you go back on a boat!

224
00:23:12,414 --> 00:23:14,609
That won't stop my story!

225
00:23:17,353 --> 00:23:18,285
What is this?

226
00:23:18,487 --> 00:23:21,513
If you weren't down here,
I wouldn't be down here.

227
00:23:21,724 --> 00:23:24,625
And I don't want to be down here!
What good is it doing?

228
00:23:24,827 --> 00:23:26,658
If anybody ever reads about this...

229
00:23:26,862 --> 00:23:29,558
...you won't be able to look them
in the face!

230
00:24:09,738 --> 00:24:10,932
Good morning.

231
00:24:11,774 --> 00:24:12,763
What time is it?

232
00:24:14,743 --> 00:24:16,267
Six o'clock.

233
00:24:17,713 --> 00:24:18,611
Shit.

234
00:24:18,814 --> 00:24:20,042
Telex for you.

235
00:24:20,683 --> 00:24:22,150
You been to the telex?

236
00:24:24,553 --> 00:24:25,918
We made the front page.

237
00:24:26,121 --> 00:24:27,088
Sure.

238
00:24:29,191 --> 00:24:31,250
We must be doing something right.

239
00:24:39,234 --> 00:24:41,828
My wife is very worried.

240
00:24:42,471 --> 00:24:46,066
She thinks all foreign journalists
are going to leave Cambodia.

241
00:24:47,576 --> 00:24:49,009
Well, Pran...

242
00:24:50,212 --> 00:24:54,615
...l'd feel kind of stupid trying to
cover this war from a desk in Bangkok.

243
00:24:56,051 --> 00:24:59,145
And she said if the war
keeps going like this...

244
00:24:59,355 --> 00:25:01,516
...the future could be very bad.

245
00:25:03,392 --> 00:25:04,689
What do you think?

246
00:25:07,763 --> 00:25:09,094
I don't know.

247
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,965
I don't know either.

248
00:25:15,738 --> 00:25:17,706
- Is Sarun downstairs?
- Sure.

249
00:25:18,941 --> 00:25:20,340
Let's get going.

250
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:22,277
All right.

251
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:29,847
Don't go back to sleep.

252
00:25:30,052 --> 00:25:31,144
I won't.

253
00:25:40,129 --> 00:25:42,359
K.R.'s making a push
for the airport road.

254
00:25:42,564 --> 00:25:44,589
If they cut it,
the city could be lost.

255
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:48,236
We hype these people up. "You'll be
all right with us," we say.

256
00:25:48,437 --> 00:25:50,701
Now look at all this fucking mess!

257
00:25:57,913 --> 00:26:01,144
In America, everybody got a good car.

258
00:26:03,385 --> 00:26:05,751
He ask you what car you drive
in United States.

259
00:26:05,954 --> 00:26:09,014
I don't have a car in America,
only the Mercedes here.

260
00:26:09,224 --> 00:26:11,419
Mercedes, number one!

261
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,485
Ask him where he learned
to speak his English.

262
00:26:17,466 --> 00:26:19,934
American advisor with his unit
teach him.

263
00:26:20,135 --> 00:26:22,194
Mercedes, number one, okay?

264
00:27:00,476 --> 00:27:01,534
What did he say?

265
00:27:01,743 --> 00:27:04,769
He said he thought all
American people left already.

266
00:27:05,414 --> 00:27:07,348
Made in the USA.

267
00:27:10,853 --> 00:27:11,877
Are we winning?

268
00:27:12,788 --> 00:27:14,881
No, you're not winning.

269
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:16,421
What should we do?

270
00:27:16,625 --> 00:27:19,856
Well, you make sure they don't
cut off the airport road.

271
00:27:22,831 --> 00:27:25,163
The first section came
by Route number 36.

272
00:27:25,834 --> 00:27:29,531
And the second one
came down by Route number 26.

273
00:27:29,738 --> 00:27:32,229
Khmer Rouge will come down Route 3.

274
00:27:32,674 --> 00:27:34,107
He doesn't know how many.

275
00:27:34,309 --> 00:27:36,300
They expect an attack today.

276
00:27:36,512 --> 00:27:38,002
- Where's your commander?
- Phnom Penh.

277
00:27:38,213 --> 00:27:39,612
- Why there?
- Don't know.

278
00:27:39,815 --> 00:27:41,749
How many mortar rounds you have...?

279
00:27:56,165 --> 00:27:59,760
Rockoff, get your ass out here!
Get out here!

280
00:28:02,404 --> 00:28:04,668
Come on, let's get him out of here!

281
00:28:32,367 --> 00:28:33,698
- Fuck this!
- They pulling out?

282
00:28:33,902 --> 00:28:35,836
I'm not happy here, Syd.

283
00:28:36,038 --> 00:28:37,938
Jon, I'm leaving.

284
00:28:38,207 --> 00:28:39,765
Syd, come on!

285
00:28:40,108 --> 00:28:41,097
Come on!

286
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:56,157
Sydney, this way!

287
00:29:17,479 --> 00:29:19,276
Sydney, look! Khmer Rouge!

288
00:30:08,864 --> 00:30:11,799
In Washington, the
Cambodian ambassador...

289
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,901
...in a speech to
the Washington Press Club said:

290
00:30:15,103 --> 00:30:18,004
"Let's face it, you took
advantage of us."

291
00:30:18,206 --> 00:30:19,104
I can't eat.

292
00:30:19,308 --> 00:30:24,143
"You are cleverer than we are, and
you induced us into this fighting."

293
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,940
Indeed, the Khmer Rouge
insurgents in Cambodia...

294
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:31,313
...have tightened their ring
around the capital, Phnom Penh...

295
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:35,115
...now swollen with some two million
refugees from the fighting.

296
00:30:35,324 --> 00:30:39,556
Reports from government troops talk
of the field situation being so bad...

297
00:30:39,761 --> 00:30:43,094
...that soldiers are having
to siphon gas from jeep to jeep...

298
00:30:43,298 --> 00:30:47,257
...in order to be able to get
the wounded back to the capital.

299
00:31:07,489 --> 00:31:09,286
No more electricity.

300
00:31:42,557 --> 00:31:45,185
And now I get a message
to try for negotiations.

301
00:31:45,394 --> 00:31:47,362
Well, it's just too goddamn late!

302
00:31:47,562 --> 00:31:49,894
Alan, this country's split apart.

303
00:31:50,098 --> 00:31:53,898
We put this ship to sea, and it breaks
my heart not to help it back to port.

304
00:31:54,102 --> 00:31:55,194
Any port.

305
00:31:56,371 --> 00:32:00,171
What pisses me off is, this country
has faults and strengths...

306
00:32:00,375 --> 00:32:03,936
...and we have done nothing
but play to the faults.

307
00:32:06,648 --> 00:32:09,640
I tell you, I will be damn
glad to get out of here.

308
00:32:09,851 --> 00:32:14,584
This thing has dragged on too long for
it to end in all sweetness and light.

309
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:17,054
After what the Khmer Rouge
have been through...

310
00:32:17,259 --> 00:32:20,228
...they won't be exactly
affectionate toward Westerners.

311
00:32:22,364 --> 00:32:25,299
- Where do you want this?
- On the floor. Anywhere.

312
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:29,095
- Mr. Schanberg...
- Oh, Christ, my dependents! Six.

313
00:32:29,304 --> 00:32:30,566
Dith Pran and family.

314
00:32:30,772 --> 00:32:31,796
Right.

315
00:32:33,141 --> 00:32:37,976
"Dear sir, my family and I are planning
a touring vacation of Southeast Asia...

316
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:42,913
...and anticipate two weeks
in Cambodia touring the country.

317
00:32:43,552 --> 00:32:46,885
Would you please send tour
information and brochures?

318
00:32:47,088 --> 00:32:49,386
Thanking you in advance,
Wendell Payne."

319
00:32:49,591 --> 00:32:52,492
Wendell lives in Wisacky,
South Carolina.

320
00:32:53,662 --> 00:32:54,822
What about the airlift?

321
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:56,588
We're taking it with us.

322
00:32:57,466 --> 00:33:00,799
- People will starve to death.
- I know, but what can we do?

323
00:33:01,002 --> 00:33:03,368
Look, there could be a bloodbath here.

324
00:33:04,673 --> 00:33:08,439
Excuse the pun, but we're
either staying or we're living.

325
00:33:19,921 --> 00:33:23,379
Hello, leaving a sinking ship then,
are we, Carver?

326
00:33:28,463 --> 00:33:32,832
President Ford, in his foreign policy
speech, hardly referred to Cambodia...

327
00:33:33,034 --> 00:33:36,970
...except to say that, as of now,
it may be too late.

328
00:33:52,387 --> 00:33:53,945
I'm sorry. I'm late.

329
00:33:54,155 --> 00:33:55,417
Where you been?

330
00:33:55,757 --> 00:33:58,487
- They stop me because of the curfew.
- The curfew, huh?

331
00:33:58,693 --> 00:34:00,320
Yes. I'm sorry.

332
00:34:02,864 --> 00:34:06,322
Get started on this.
Tell them to start sending this out...

333
00:34:06,535 --> 00:34:10,232
...but hold the last two paragraphs.
I'll have corrections in an hour.

334
00:34:11,473 --> 00:34:15,466
They don't transmit today.
The transmitter at Kambol got hit.

335
00:34:17,145 --> 00:34:19,511
They say 6 p.m. We can file.

336
00:34:19,714 --> 00:34:21,147
6 p.m.

337
00:34:22,784 --> 00:34:26,151
What do you think this is?
A monthly magazine?

338
00:34:26,354 --> 00:34:28,345
This is a newspaper.

339
00:34:31,326 --> 00:34:33,055
How about update tomorrow?

340
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:38,697
Yeah, sure. We can file
an update tomorrow.

341
00:34:48,176 --> 00:34:50,576
I was over at the
American Embassy yesterday.

342
00:34:51,813 --> 00:34:52,677
Good news?

343
00:34:52,881 --> 00:34:54,678
No, not good news.

344
00:35:00,689 --> 00:35:03,419
They say that when
this place goes up...

345
00:35:06,828 --> 00:35:10,423
...they think a lot of people
will be killed. A lot of people.

346
00:35:11,666 --> 00:35:15,329
I've arranged for the evacuation
of you and your family.

347
00:35:18,173 --> 00:35:20,607
So now it's up to you.
What do you want to do?

348
00:35:23,111 --> 00:35:25,136
Do you want to stay
or leave?

349
00:35:33,855 --> 00:35:34,879
And how about you?

350
00:35:36,091 --> 00:35:37,956
That's none of your business.

351
00:35:43,898 --> 00:35:46,628
Do you want to stay,
or do you want to leave?

352
00:35:50,205 --> 00:35:51,399
I know.

353
00:35:52,173 --> 00:35:53,800
You love my family.

354
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:00,980
But me, I'm reporter too.

355
00:36:01,683 --> 00:36:03,173
You know what I mean?

356
00:36:18,366 --> 00:36:22,029
All right, we don't have
to decide this right now.

357
00:36:22,237 --> 00:36:23,602
Take it easy.

358
00:36:28,643 --> 00:36:31,737
But we'll have to make up our
minds pretty soon, right?

359
00:37:44,652 --> 00:37:47,348
All right, this is it!
Is the floor clear?

360
00:37:48,623 --> 00:37:50,318
This is the last check.

361
00:37:53,194 --> 00:37:55,754
Last check. This is the last check!

362
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:03,860
Mr. Kincaid is not here.

363
00:38:04,172 --> 00:38:07,232
Mr. Kincaid is gone.
You keep Mr. Kincaid's money.

364
00:38:07,675 --> 00:38:09,472
Now, I want you to go right now!

365
00:38:09,911 --> 00:38:11,503
I want you to leave now!

366
00:38:11,713 --> 00:38:13,806
You won't see Mr. Kincaid again!

367
00:38:27,262 --> 00:38:29,457
Okay, sergeant, let him in!

368
00:38:32,634 --> 00:38:35,933
Have you got Pran here?
Have you got Pran on there?

369
00:38:36,137 --> 00:38:38,765
- And his wife?
- Yes, sir, they are.

370
00:38:38,973 --> 00:38:42,204
- Did they come in yet?
- No, sir, they haven't arrived yet.

371
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:57,153
Have you seen Pran?

372
00:38:57,358 --> 00:38:58,347
No, I haven't.

373
00:38:59,127 --> 00:39:00,151
Where is he?

374
00:39:04,165 --> 00:39:05,962
Well, it's been real.

375
00:39:11,472 --> 00:39:12,962
They're gonna miss it.

376
00:39:13,741 --> 00:39:16,266
Why don't you check around
the other side?

377
00:39:16,945 --> 00:39:19,971
If he comes here, I'm looking
for him in the back.

378
00:39:32,093 --> 00:39:34,527
Beth! Have you seen Pran?

379
00:39:34,729 --> 00:39:36,924
No, have you looked at the hotel?

380
00:39:37,131 --> 00:39:38,996
He's at the post office!

381
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,992
The post office!

382
00:40:09,664 --> 00:40:11,928
Get the fuck out!
Get out of here now!

383
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,395
Move your asses out of here!

384
00:40:14,869 --> 00:40:16,336
Hold those doors!

385
00:40:20,308 --> 00:40:23,243
- Where do you think you're going?
- To embassy.

386
00:40:39,127 --> 00:40:40,617
Yes, sir, what's your name?

387
00:40:40,828 --> 00:40:42,193
Dith Pran family, sir.

388
00:40:42,397 --> 00:40:44,160
Dith Pran family?

389
00:40:44,365 --> 00:40:46,697
- Sydney Schanberg.
- They've been through.

390
00:40:47,168 --> 00:40:49,659
- They've been through.
- Check one more time, please.

391
00:40:49,871 --> 00:40:52,135
- You made a mistake, sir.
- No mistake.

392
00:41:00,581 --> 00:41:02,048
Rockoff, help me!

393
00:43:14,382 --> 00:43:15,212
Run!

394
00:43:15,683 --> 00:43:17,173
There's no time!

395
00:44:25,753 --> 00:44:26,720
Wait a minute.

396
00:44:30,424 --> 00:44:31,448
Smile.

397
00:44:58,386 --> 00:44:59,444
Jon.

398
00:45:00,021 --> 00:45:01,113
Hello, Sydney.

399
00:45:18,539 --> 00:45:22,441
If the going gets rough, I heard
our best bet's the French Embassy.

400
00:45:25,213 --> 00:45:26,510
Who told you that?

401
00:45:29,483 --> 00:45:31,212
The British Embassy.

402
00:46:01,716 --> 00:46:03,377
Khmer Rouge coming.

403
00:46:03,584 --> 00:46:06,747
Look like government soldiers
give them big welcome.

404
00:47:11,085 --> 00:47:12,484
No more fighting!

405
00:47:12,853 --> 00:47:14,184
I be right back!

406
00:47:30,338 --> 00:47:32,169
No more fighting! No more war!

407
00:47:32,606 --> 00:47:33,937
What do you think?

408
00:47:35,042 --> 00:47:36,771
I don't like the look of this.

409
00:47:36,977 --> 00:47:41,676
I was in Keng Kang this morning.
Practically got my ass shot off.

410
00:47:41,882 --> 00:47:44,817
I just don't think these guys
are for real.

411
00:47:45,086 --> 00:47:48,283
I'm going to the hospital.
You want to come with me?

412
00:48:55,723 --> 00:48:58,089
Tetracaine, 50 milligrams, please.

413
00:48:58,926 --> 00:49:01,656
Jesus, what am I supposed to do?
Sing her a lullaby?

414
00:49:01,862 --> 00:49:04,228
Pentothal, 150 milligrams, quick.

415
00:49:15,576 --> 00:49:18,875
Jesus, another shrapnel
in the spine here.

416
00:49:19,079 --> 00:49:20,774
Okay, let's have her over.

417
00:49:26,587 --> 00:49:31,183
This is blood group A. We've had one
unit of blood in the last two days.

418
00:49:32,092 --> 00:49:34,117
Plasma substitute, please, quick.

419
00:49:35,029 --> 00:49:37,623
We've plenty of blood, gentlemen.
Plenty of blood.

420
00:49:37,832 --> 00:49:40,426
The problem is, it's all in
the wrong fucking place.

421
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:47,434
Why do corpses have to pile up before
people decide it's time to go home?

422
00:50:15,269 --> 00:50:17,794
For God's sake, back up the car!
Sarun, back it up!

423
00:50:18,005 --> 00:50:20,439
For God's sake, back it up now!

424
00:51:36,183 --> 00:51:39,710
- Why doesn't he get his ass in here?
- He's trying to get in!

425
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:41,517
They won't let him in.

426
00:52:05,112 --> 00:52:06,238
All right?

427
00:58:25,125 --> 00:58:26,057
Okay?

428
00:58:26,259 --> 00:58:27,453
Looks all right.

429
01:01:27,874 --> 01:01:28,932
I'm coming!

430
01:01:36,850 --> 01:01:38,875
Just a minute! He's with me!

431
01:01:39,152 --> 01:01:40,983
He's with The New York Times!

432
01:01:41,188 --> 01:01:44,385
Wait just a minute!
He's a journalist and he's with me!

433
01:01:44,958 --> 01:01:48,359
Where is the consul? I want to talk
to the consul. Let me see him!

434
01:01:48,628 --> 01:01:51,290
You tell me where he is.
I want to speak to him!

435
01:01:52,265 --> 01:01:56,099
The picture in Cambodia
is increasingly unclear.

436
01:01:56,303 --> 01:01:59,704
Journalists who have flown
from Thailand over Phnom Penh...

437
01:01:59,906 --> 01:02:02,568
...report that the Khmer Rouge
have attempted...

438
01:02:02,776 --> 01:02:05,904
...a mass evacuation
of the entire population.

439
01:02:06,112 --> 01:02:10,674
Radio contact with the French Embassy
reveals that some 200 Europeans...

440
01:02:10,884 --> 01:02:15,184
...and an undisclosed number
of Cambodians have taken refuge.

441
01:02:15,388 --> 01:02:19,518
As yet, no statement has been made
by the new rulers of Cambodia.

442
01:02:19,726 --> 01:02:24,288
The whereabouts of Prince Sihanouk
and the Khmer Rouge leadership...

443
01:02:24,497 --> 01:02:25,964
...are not clear.

444
01:02:31,871 --> 01:02:34,305
- Okay?
- Yes. He's sleeping.

445
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:00,964
That's the consul.

446
01:03:10,243 --> 01:03:13,178
- Did you see that, Dennis?
- The Russians are coming.

447
01:03:19,419 --> 01:03:21,182
Look, piss off! Please!

448
01:03:21,388 --> 01:03:24,516
Get out! You won't get
anything here! Out!

449
01:03:32,265 --> 01:03:34,256
First, the main points of the news.

450
01:03:34,467 --> 01:03:35,991
BBC, Dougal.

451
01:03:38,738 --> 01:03:41,571
- Daily reports of fighting
around the airport...

452
01:03:41,775 --> 01:03:45,609
...14 kilometers outside Phnom Penh,
the capital of Cambodia.

453
01:03:46,546 --> 01:03:50,482
And now, an on-the-spot report
from our correspondent in Thailand...

454
01:03:50,684 --> 01:03:51,742
...Hugh Elder.

455
01:03:53,687 --> 01:03:55,814
Where do they get this crap?

456
01:03:56,356 --> 01:03:59,484
Do you see that guy across the gate?
The little guy?

457
01:04:00,593 --> 01:04:03,118
Could we not all look at once, please?

458
01:04:03,897 --> 01:04:07,492
I have it on reliable sources
that that's Hugh Elder.

459
01:04:08,234 --> 01:04:09,064
You're kidding.

460
01:04:09,269 --> 01:04:12,727
He's disguised, but I got suspicious
about him. You know what I mean?

461
01:04:12,939 --> 01:04:15,908
- How does he get copy out?
- How does he get his copy out?

462
01:04:16,109 --> 01:04:17,838
With specially trained hens.

463
01:04:19,145 --> 01:04:23,343
The BBC has, like, commissioned
them to walk past the Khmer Rouge...

464
01:04:23,550 --> 01:04:25,313
...like their regular fowl.

465
01:04:25,518 --> 01:04:30,046
They've been crossing the border into
Thailand every day and every night.

466
01:04:31,124 --> 01:04:32,182
I told you.

467
01:04:33,059 --> 01:04:36,324
Unconfirmed reports say
the Khmer Rouge are demanding...

468
01:04:36,529 --> 01:04:40,158
...that any officials of
the defeated Lon Nol government...

469
01:04:40,367 --> 01:04:43,461
...especially the so-called
Six Traitors of the Cabinet...

470
01:04:43,670 --> 01:04:45,297
...be handed over to them.

471
01:04:45,505 --> 01:04:48,235
It is not known whether
any of the ex-ministers...

472
01:04:48,441 --> 01:04:50,534
...may have taken refuge
in the embassy...

473
01:04:50,744 --> 01:04:54,180
...where, in the words of a UNICEF
representative in Bangkok...

474
01:04:54,381 --> 01:04:58,317
...the situation is said to be
"increasingly precarious."

475
01:06:28,096 --> 01:06:31,827
And when I tried to go
just a kilometer further, no.

476
01:06:32,033 --> 01:06:34,662
The only sense I can make of it
is that there's...

477
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:37,805
...some sort of internal
power struggle going on.

478
01:06:38,374 --> 01:06:41,775
Different groups seem to be
holding different parts of the city...

479
01:06:42,479 --> 01:06:47,280
...and they all appear to be equally
nervous over losing power and control.

480
01:06:47,851 --> 01:06:49,876
Half of them are under 15.

481
01:06:50,587 --> 01:06:53,523
Some Red Cross instruction
sheets want translating.

482
01:06:53,724 --> 01:06:54,713
Can you help?

483
01:06:55,059 --> 01:06:57,493
Use Pran. He speaks French
better than I do.

484
01:06:57,695 --> 01:06:59,754
I'd prefer it if it was you.

485
01:07:11,077 --> 01:07:12,567
What did you do that for?

486
01:07:13,012 --> 01:07:15,173
The guy's insecure enough already.

487
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:19,976
The Cambodians have
to leave the embassy.

488
01:07:22,689 --> 01:07:26,250
They want all our passports
and everybody downstairs...

489
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:28,820
...and the Cambodians out.

490
01:08:06,839 --> 01:08:08,636
If you have papers,
you have a name.

491
01:08:08,841 --> 01:08:11,036
If we have a name,
we can find the mother.

492
01:08:11,810 --> 01:08:14,439
Look, I fight for five years.

493
01:08:15,081 --> 01:08:16,446
Useless war.

494
01:08:19,252 --> 01:08:20,219
Fuck!

495
01:08:22,622 --> 01:08:25,387
Pran is not gonna last
five minutes out there.

496
01:08:25,593 --> 01:08:29,359
The Khmer Rouge have killed every
journalist they've ever caught.

497
01:08:29,730 --> 01:08:31,425
Does Syd know how serious this is?

498
01:08:31,632 --> 01:08:35,296
- Of course he bloody knows!
- We can't let him walk out of here.

499
01:08:36,071 --> 01:08:40,132
Look, two passports. This one's
out-of-date, but the visa's valid.

500
01:08:40,342 --> 01:08:42,538
Jon Ankertill Brewer Swain.

501
01:08:42,745 --> 01:08:46,943
Knock out the Jon, knock out the Swain,
and you're left with Ankertill Brewer.

502
01:08:47,617 --> 01:08:51,054
Change my photograph for one of Pran,
and he's a British subject.

503
01:08:51,255 --> 01:08:52,483
It's worth a try.

504
01:08:52,789 --> 01:08:56,589
I hope he's got a photo because
I don't have any fucking film.

505
01:09:11,110 --> 01:09:13,442
I try to escape to Thailand right now.

506
01:09:13,646 --> 01:09:15,409
Give me two or three weeks.

507
01:09:16,882 --> 01:09:18,942
If you get there first, let me know.

508
01:09:19,519 --> 01:09:22,249
And leave message for me
at Reuters. Okay?

509
01:09:23,089 --> 01:09:26,820
Just give me an hour.
I need some time to think.

510
01:09:27,728 --> 01:09:29,719
I got no time to give you.

511
01:09:31,332 --> 01:09:33,095
Swain's got an idea.

512
01:09:39,241 --> 01:09:41,505
Ankertill Brewer.
That's the new name.

513
01:09:41,710 --> 01:09:44,235
- Ankertill Brewer.
- Right. Now, my photograph.

514
01:09:44,446 --> 01:09:47,473
- Change my photograph for yours.
- Do you have an old photo?

515
01:09:47,684 --> 01:09:48,673
I don't think so.

516
01:09:49,552 --> 01:09:51,213
Give him your passport.

517
01:09:51,421 --> 01:09:53,582
Your old passport,
a family snapshot, anything.

518
01:09:53,790 --> 01:09:54,849
Khmer Rouge took everything.

519
01:09:55,059 --> 01:09:57,084
- What about your press card?
- Everything!

520
01:09:57,294 --> 01:09:58,158
Fuck!

521
01:09:58,729 --> 01:10:01,357
- Didn't give it back.
- We'll go and find some film.

522
01:10:01,565 --> 01:10:05,593
There's film here. We'll get it.
Polaroid, any kind, any speed.

523
01:10:06,671 --> 01:10:09,367
We're gonna get it,
and I'll shoot it, okay?

524
01:10:09,574 --> 01:10:11,064
We'll find the film.

525
01:10:13,246 --> 01:10:15,578
Do you have a Polaroid camera?
Do you have film?

526
01:10:15,781 --> 01:10:17,339
No, I haven't got any film!

527
01:10:17,550 --> 01:10:22,181
I've also got no metronidazole, and
this child has got amebic dysentery!

528
01:10:24,891 --> 01:10:27,155
We've gotta get sulfide
and a developer.

529
01:10:27,361 --> 01:10:29,556
If we can get that,
I can make the photo.

530
01:10:29,896 --> 01:10:30,863
Shit!

531
01:10:31,366 --> 01:10:35,166
Listen, I know where we can get
some water. We can drain...

532
01:10:35,370 --> 01:10:38,703
...the air conditioning vent.
I've seen it done. Come on.

533
01:10:43,779 --> 01:10:46,612
Excuse me, you're Mr. Schanberg?

534
01:10:47,516 --> 01:10:51,044
I've been told that you're
in charge of bed covers.

535
01:10:51,254 --> 01:10:52,152
What?

536
01:10:53,490 --> 01:10:57,324
Blankets. We've just arrived.
We want some blankets.

537
01:10:58,729 --> 01:11:00,390
Come on down here.

538
01:11:01,032 --> 01:11:02,932
Go to the end of the hall there.

539
01:11:04,268 --> 01:11:06,259
Turn to the right,
go up the stairs.

540
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:09,804
If there are any, they'll be
at the top of the stairs.

541
01:11:10,008 --> 01:11:13,273
Syd, I have got the camera...

542
01:11:13,979 --> 01:11:15,571
...I have got the film...

543
01:11:16,048 --> 01:11:19,041
...and I have got
the fucking darkroom!

544
01:11:23,756 --> 01:11:25,986
All right. Don't smile.

545
01:11:29,163 --> 01:11:31,654
- You're smiling.
- Very serious. You are smiling.

546
01:11:32,099 --> 01:11:33,464
Stop, please.

547
01:11:33,667 --> 01:11:36,660
- Very serious.
- Very serious, very American.

548
01:11:51,617 --> 01:11:52,743
Okay, cover it.

549
01:11:58,492 --> 01:12:00,722
This fucking paper, I don't know.

550
01:12:01,461 --> 01:12:04,056
That was the stuff you found
in the coatroom.

551
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:07,929
Ankertill Brewer.

552
01:12:08,803 --> 01:12:11,237
Ankertill Brewer.

553
01:12:26,856 --> 01:12:29,188
Getting an image.
Look at it.

554
01:12:29,392 --> 01:12:30,951
Look, the bugger's face.

555
01:12:31,162 --> 01:12:33,426
It sure is. Come on.

556
01:12:34,365 --> 01:12:35,627
Come on.

557
01:12:36,634 --> 01:12:37,726
Come on.

558
01:12:39,303 --> 01:12:40,828
Now fix it.

559
01:12:42,541 --> 01:12:43,974
That's good.

560
01:12:47,345 --> 01:12:49,576
Oh, no. Fuck, it's fogging.

561
01:12:49,882 --> 01:12:51,213
Goddamn it.

562
01:12:52,552 --> 01:12:54,281
Goddamn this paper!

563
01:12:54,487 --> 01:12:57,753
Goddamn it!
We're gonna have to start again.

564
01:13:07,202 --> 01:13:08,794
Okay, now we gotta fix it.

565
01:13:10,939 --> 01:13:11,997
I did it.

566
01:13:14,242 --> 01:13:15,675
Let me have that.

567
01:13:18,247 --> 01:13:19,407
It's fading.

568
01:13:20,349 --> 01:13:21,316
Take it out.

569
01:13:21,517 --> 01:13:25,318
No, it's already gone. The solution's
too strong. It's fading.

570
01:13:25,522 --> 01:13:27,285
Take it out now.
I mean, if it's...

571
01:13:27,491 --> 01:13:28,549
Fuck!

572
01:13:29,659 --> 01:13:31,126
Goddamn it!

573
01:13:35,133 --> 01:13:38,534
Man, this fucking room is killing me.

574
01:13:38,803 --> 01:13:40,134
Could I just...?

575
01:13:40,571 --> 01:13:42,402
I'll just do it myself, okay?

576
01:13:42,607 --> 01:13:45,941
Let me just have a few feet
in here by myself.

577
01:13:46,879 --> 01:13:47,903
Fuck.

578
01:13:49,281 --> 01:13:50,213
Sorry.

579
01:14:04,865 --> 01:14:06,093
That's it.

580
01:14:22,819 --> 01:14:24,218
It's perfect.

581
01:14:25,555 --> 01:14:26,681
Perfect.

582
01:14:41,472 --> 01:14:43,770
Welcome to New York. We got it.

583
01:14:43,975 --> 01:14:46,136
Perfect. Rockoff, perfect!

584
01:14:46,344 --> 01:14:49,041
Ankertill Brewer. Ankertill Brewer.

585
01:14:49,281 --> 01:14:52,910
All right, you jokers, would you like
to bring your passports over to me?

586
01:14:53,118 --> 01:14:55,586
This is the last call for passports.

587
01:14:56,355 --> 01:14:58,017
Can I have your passports, please?

588
01:14:58,792 --> 01:15:00,760
Can I have your passports, please?

589
01:15:02,162 --> 01:15:03,151
Thank you.

590
01:15:03,463 --> 01:15:05,522
Passports, ladies and gents.

591
01:15:06,868 --> 01:15:10,895
All right, you jokers, this is your
last chance to get your passports in.

592
01:15:14,108 --> 01:15:15,406
Your passports, please.

593
01:15:15,611 --> 01:15:17,772
On this passport depend my life.

594
01:15:19,448 --> 01:15:20,278
Thank you.

595
01:15:21,049 --> 01:15:24,816
Passports, ladies. This is for
the big tour, the big package.

596
01:15:27,423 --> 01:15:30,881
From Thursday Island right down
to Mount Macedon...

597
01:15:31,094 --> 01:15:33,655
...to see the famous Hanging Rock.

598
01:15:33,864 --> 01:15:35,456
Come on, passports, please.

599
01:15:36,834 --> 01:15:38,927
Ladies and gentlemen, last call.

600
01:15:39,136 --> 01:15:40,330
Going...

601
01:15:40,838 --> 01:15:41,668
...going...

602
01:15:46,311 --> 01:15:47,335
...gone.

603
01:16:19,147 --> 01:16:20,342
Is this lunch?

604
01:16:25,955 --> 01:16:26,819
What?

605
01:16:30,026 --> 01:16:32,085
It seems certain
that the majority...

606
01:16:32,295 --> 01:16:37,028
...of Phnom Penh's population has
been evacuated to the countryside.

607
01:16:37,233 --> 01:16:40,601
The population is swollen
with thousands of refugees.

608
01:16:40,905 --> 01:16:41,963
Hello again.

609
01:16:46,811 --> 01:16:51,374
It'll be argued by some that this is
a way of coping with postwar chaos.

610
01:16:51,783 --> 01:16:54,251
Dennis, can you turn
that down, please?

611
01:16:56,723 --> 01:16:58,384
Now, listen, everybody.

612
01:17:00,326 --> 01:17:04,729
The trucks which we've seen arriving
are for our evacuation.

613
01:17:05,031 --> 01:17:07,899
Probably in the next 24 hours.

614
01:17:08,602 --> 01:17:11,093
Now, listen. That's to be confirmed.

615
01:17:11,572 --> 01:17:13,597
It's almost certainly for Thailand.

616
01:17:24,186 --> 01:17:26,211
These so-called journalists
have no right...

617
01:17:26,422 --> 01:17:30,586
You're not biased? You haven't
seen any atrocities in Cambodia?

618
01:17:30,793 --> 01:17:34,457
- It's just an emotional spasm!
- Yes, it is, yes. So just shut up!

619
01:17:34,664 --> 01:17:37,030
You have to break eggs
to make an omelet!

620
01:18:31,027 --> 01:18:33,461
Sydney, Ankertill Brewer.

621
01:20:44,074 --> 01:20:47,101
- Thank you. Goodbye.
- Good luck.

622
01:20:49,113 --> 01:20:51,377
- Give me these back in Paris.
- Goodbye.

623
01:20:51,582 --> 01:20:53,209
Don't forget. All right?

624
01:20:53,417 --> 01:20:56,319
Why didn't you get him out
when you had the chance?

625
01:20:56,521 --> 01:20:58,284
You had no right to keep him here!

626
01:20:58,490 --> 01:21:00,617
You've got a funny
sense of priorities.

627
01:21:00,826 --> 01:21:03,796
I'm a reporter too, Morgan.
I know his heart.

628
01:21:04,030 --> 01:21:06,089
- I love him like my brother.
- Sure.

629
01:21:06,299 --> 01:21:09,291
And I do anything for him.
Anything.

630
01:21:14,975 --> 01:21:16,340
Goodbye, Rockoff.

631
01:21:38,768 --> 01:21:41,329
Tell my wife I love her...

632
01:21:41,538 --> 01:21:43,870
...and look after all my children.

633
01:21:45,175 --> 01:21:48,611
She doesn't speak any English.

634
01:21:50,515 --> 01:21:51,914
Please...

635
01:21:52,583 --> 01:21:56,178
...I don't want anyone
to be bad to my wife.

636
01:22:32,327 --> 01:22:33,726
Dith Pran.

637
01:22:34,629 --> 01:22:37,861
P-R-A-N.
He disappeared in Phnom Penh in 1975.

638
01:22:38,067 --> 01:22:41,264
Pran is his first name.
Any information you can give.

639
01:22:42,205 --> 01:22:45,198
Well, we're hoping
for any information at all.

640
01:22:45,809 --> 01:22:49,176
He was last seen in '75.
Can you get me that number again?

641
01:22:49,380 --> 01:22:50,210
In April 1975.

642
01:22:50,414 --> 01:22:55,114
4144-5364...

643
01:23:27,088 --> 01:23:29,318
Pran is a resourceful man.

644
01:23:29,524 --> 01:23:32,153
He will wait until he knows
that it's safe...

645
01:23:32,361 --> 01:23:34,192
...and then he'll make his move.

646
01:23:50,614 --> 01:23:53,310
Thank you for coming...

647
01:23:53,584 --> 01:23:55,711
...and taking care of her
and her family.

648
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:59,379
But she knows that
her husband is dead.

649
01:24:00,025 --> 01:24:01,390
That's not true.

650
01:24:03,094 --> 01:24:05,494
That's absolutely not true.

651
01:24:13,172 --> 01:24:15,299
It's not true. It's not.

652
01:24:16,577 --> 01:24:18,442
She doesn't believe you...

653
01:24:18,645 --> 01:24:21,705
...because she knows
her husband is dead.

654
01:24:44,841 --> 01:24:46,035
You're a good man.

655
01:24:48,445 --> 01:24:52,404
If your mother needs anything,
make sure she gets in touch with me.

656
01:24:56,387 --> 01:24:57,718
You better go.

657
01:26:39,034 --> 01:26:40,661
For the past 5 years...

658
01:26:41,236 --> 01:26:44,331
...as indicated on this map
that you see here...

659
01:26:44,774 --> 01:26:49,211
...North Vietnam has occupied
military sanctuaries...

660
01:26:49,412 --> 01:26:53,474
...all along the Cambodian frontier
with South Vietnam.

661
01:26:54,051 --> 01:26:55,382
As the President spoke...

662
01:26:55,586 --> 01:26:59,113
...American troops were preparing
to move into Cambodia.

663
01:27:01,359 --> 01:27:05,261
The decision to invade, like
the earlier secret decision to bomb...

664
01:27:05,463 --> 01:27:07,431
...was withheld from
the Cambodian people.

665
01:27:07,799 --> 01:27:11,031
We will yell at the top of our lungs.
We will move.

666
01:27:12,271 --> 01:27:16,503
It's the fear that makes a man
so scared, you know?

667
01:27:23,083 --> 01:27:26,052
There are no American
combat advisors in Cambodia.

668
01:27:26,253 --> 01:27:29,985
There will be no American
combat troops or advisors in Cambodia.

669
01:27:30,191 --> 01:27:31,715
We will aid Cambodia.

670
01:27:31,926 --> 01:27:36,329
Cambodia is the Nixon doctrine
in its purest form.

671
01:32:39,533 --> 01:32:40,660
Sydney...

672
01:32:41,403 --> 01:32:45,339
...I think of you often
and often my family.

673
01:32:46,007 --> 01:32:49,340
They tell us that God is dead.

674
01:32:49,577 --> 01:32:52,809
And now the party they call
the Angka...

675
01:32:53,015 --> 01:32:55,745
...will provide everything for us.

676
01:32:56,385 --> 01:32:59,321
He says Angka has identified...

677
01:32:59,523 --> 01:33:01,514
...and proclaims the existence...

678
01:33:01,725 --> 01:33:03,955
...of a bad new disease...

679
01:33:04,161 --> 01:33:09,065
...a memory sickness diagnosed
as thinking too much about life...

680
01:33:09,267 --> 01:33:12,236
...in prerevolutionary Cambodia.

681
01:33:13,137 --> 01:33:17,165
He says we are surrounded by enemies.

682
01:33:17,743 --> 01:33:20,177
The enemy is inside us.

683
01:33:20,679 --> 01:33:22,874
No one can be trusted.

684
01:33:32,158 --> 01:33:34,649
We must be like the ox...

685
01:33:34,861 --> 01:33:38,559
...and have no thought
except for the Party.

686
01:33:38,766 --> 01:33:42,202
No love but for the Angka.

687
01:33:46,908 --> 01:33:48,432
People starve...

688
01:33:49,778 --> 01:33:51,871
...but we must not grow food.

689
01:33:54,817 --> 01:33:56,785
We must honor the comrade children...

690
01:33:56,986 --> 01:34:00,251
...whose minds are not corrupted
by the past.

691
01:34:28,921 --> 01:34:30,320
Is anybody of us...

692
01:34:30,524 --> 01:34:31,388
...a doctor...

693
01:34:32,025 --> 01:34:33,117
...professor...

694
01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:34,793
...and student?

695
01:34:35,262 --> 01:34:37,059
Angka needs you.

696
01:34:37,898 --> 01:34:39,867
Angka has forgiven all the past.

697
01:34:54,783 --> 01:34:55,875
Sydney...

698
01:34:56,919 --> 01:35:01,380
...Angka says that those
who were guilty of soft living...

699
01:35:01,591 --> 01:35:04,253
...in the years
of the great struggle...

700
01:35:04,460 --> 01:35:08,557
...and did not care for the sufferings
of the peasant must confess...

701
01:35:09,633 --> 01:35:12,693
...because now is the year zero...

702
01:35:12,970 --> 01:35:15,632
...and everything is to start anew.

703
01:35:24,282 --> 01:35:26,444
I'm full of fear, Sydney.

704
01:35:26,886 --> 01:35:29,684
I must show no understanding.

705
01:35:30,223 --> 01:35:32,350
Not of French or English.

706
01:35:32,825 --> 01:35:35,056
I must have no past, Sydney.

707
01:35:36,363 --> 01:35:38,490
This is the year zero...

708
01:35:39,066 --> 01:35:41,296
...and nothing has gone before.

709
01:35:53,482 --> 01:35:57,316
The wind whispers of fear and hate.

710
01:35:57,720 --> 01:36:00,712
The war has killed love, Sydney.

711
01:36:01,156 --> 01:36:04,854
And those who confess
to the Angka vanish.

712
01:36:05,195 --> 01:36:08,562
And no one dare ask where they go.

713
01:36:08,932 --> 01:36:13,233
Here, only the silent survive.

714
01:41:57,585 --> 01:42:00,180
Mercedes, number one!

715
01:47:33,591 --> 01:47:37,994
Anyone who knows my work will know
that half of this belongs to Dith Pran.

716
01:47:40,599 --> 01:47:44,592
Without Pran, I wouldn't have been able
to file half the stories I did.

717
01:47:46,872 --> 01:47:50,365
It's nice to congratulate ourselves
on occasions like this.

718
01:47:50,710 --> 01:47:52,837
But I can't stand here tonight...

719
01:47:53,046 --> 01:47:55,708
...without thinking
of those innocent people...

720
01:47:55,915 --> 01:48:00,546
...Pran dedicated himself to helping
me bring to the notice of the public.

721
01:48:03,323 --> 01:48:06,760
As they pondered their options
in the White House...

722
01:48:06,961 --> 01:48:11,295
...the men who decided to bomb
and then to invade Cambodia...

723
01:48:11,966 --> 01:48:14,400
...concerned themselves
with many things:

724
01:48:15,771 --> 01:48:19,832
Great power conflicts
and collapsing dominoes...

725
01:48:21,143 --> 01:48:24,010
...looking tough and dangerous
to the North Vietnamese...

726
01:48:24,313 --> 01:48:28,614
...relieving pressure on the American
troop withdrawal from the South.

727
01:48:29,586 --> 01:48:31,850
They had domestic concerns as well...

728
01:48:32,055 --> 01:48:36,857
...which helps explain why they kept
the bombing of Cambodia a secret.

729
01:48:37,695 --> 01:48:41,392
And they may be assumed not to have
ignored self-interest...

730
01:48:41,599 --> 01:48:43,192
...in their own careers.

731
01:48:43,969 --> 01:48:46,665
What they specifically were not
concerned with...

732
01:48:46,872 --> 01:48:49,397
...were the Cambodians themselves.

733
01:48:49,808 --> 01:48:51,639
Not the people...

734
01:48:52,111 --> 01:48:54,103
...not the society...

735
01:48:54,581 --> 01:48:56,208
...not the country.

736
01:48:57,484 --> 01:49:00,851
Except in the abstract
as instruments of policy.

737
01:49:04,792 --> 01:49:06,555
Dith Pran and I...

738
01:49:07,294 --> 01:49:09,285
...tried to record and bring home...

739
01:49:09,497 --> 01:49:13,264
...the concrete consequences
of these decisions to real people.

740
01:49:13,802 --> 01:49:15,599
To human beings...

741
01:49:16,905 --> 01:49:19,669
...the people left out
of the Administration's plans...

742
01:49:19,876 --> 01:49:21,707
...but who paid the price...

743
01:49:21,911 --> 01:49:24,106
...and took the beating for them.

744
01:49:29,586 --> 01:49:33,750
I'm very pleased to accept this
on behalf of Dith Pran and myself.

745
01:49:34,291 --> 01:49:35,918
I'm very honored...

746
01:49:36,593 --> 01:49:39,256
...and I know that Pran would be
very proud.

747
01:49:51,977 --> 01:49:55,708
Do you plan to continue
with that theme in the future?

748
01:49:58,385 --> 01:50:01,149
Congratulations, Ernie.
Do it again next year!

749
01:50:01,354 --> 01:50:02,753
I'm sorry.

750
01:50:05,826 --> 01:50:08,727
- That was great, really good.
- Better than last year.

751
01:50:09,630 --> 01:50:12,190
Abe, meet my sister.

752
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:14,231
I'm very happy to meet you.

753
01:50:14,435 --> 01:50:16,904
That's my dad.
Would you hold this for me?

754
01:50:18,006 --> 01:50:18,973
One second.

755
01:50:19,174 --> 01:50:22,371
I hoped you could recommend
a good school for journalism.

756
01:50:22,578 --> 01:50:25,548
I told my daughter I'd be
seeing you today.

757
01:50:25,748 --> 01:50:28,615
Just one minute, okay?
I'll be right back.

758
01:50:37,761 --> 01:50:41,561
Could I have your autograph?
I'm a great admirer of yours.

759
01:50:44,169 --> 01:50:46,865
Congratulations on your award,
it was well-deserved.

760
01:50:47,072 --> 01:50:50,337
Very impressive.
I was hoping you'd burst into song.

761
01:50:51,811 --> 01:50:54,541
- What are you doing here?
- You know what bothers me?

762
01:50:54,747 --> 01:50:55,577
What?

763
01:50:55,982 --> 01:50:58,678
It bothers me that you let Pran
stay in Cambodia...

764
01:50:58,884 --> 01:51:02,013
...because you wanted to win,
and you knew you needed him...

765
01:51:02,222 --> 01:51:04,952
- I didn't have any idea what...
- The fuck you didn't!

766
01:51:06,860 --> 01:51:08,987
The fuck you didn't.

767
01:51:09,596 --> 01:51:13,089
I did everything I could,
and I'm doing everything I can.

768
01:51:13,301 --> 01:51:15,633
Nice to see you.
I'm on my way to Florida.

769
01:51:15,837 --> 01:51:17,395
I'm doing everything I can.

770
01:51:17,605 --> 01:51:20,905
I'm sure. I didn't realize
you'd been out there to see him.

771
01:51:21,110 --> 01:51:24,375
Don't play games with me, Al.
Don't play stupid games.

772
01:51:24,580 --> 01:51:28,244
Nobody gets to go in there.
If I thought I could, I would.

773
01:51:29,119 --> 01:51:31,144
I've sent out hundreds of photographs.

774
01:51:31,354 --> 01:51:35,017
Every relief organization
on the Thai-Kampuchean border...

775
01:51:38,729 --> 01:51:42,529
...has got his picture. If I saw
one glimmer of hope, I'd go today.

776
01:51:43,067 --> 01:51:44,591
Life isn't a '40s movie.

777
01:51:44,802 --> 01:51:48,637
You can't just get on a plane and
make the whole world come out right!

778
01:51:50,242 --> 01:51:53,040
And I can't believe
I'm hearing this from you!

779
01:51:57,850 --> 01:51:59,147
Congrats.

780
01:52:01,220 --> 01:52:03,780
Do you keep in touch
with Dith Pran's family?

781
01:52:03,990 --> 01:52:06,186
Yes. They're living in San Francisco.

782
01:52:06,393 --> 01:52:09,260
How do you respond to accusations
that journalists...

783
01:52:09,463 --> 01:52:11,829
...underestimated the brutality
of the Khmer Rouge...

784
01:52:12,032 --> 01:52:15,764
...and so share responsibility for
what happened in Cambodia afterwards?

785
01:52:16,438 --> 01:52:18,269
We made a mistake.

786
01:52:18,840 --> 01:52:21,434
Maybe we underestimated
the kind of insanity...

787
01:52:21,643 --> 01:52:24,169
...that $ 7 billion worth
of bombing could produce.

788
01:52:24,380 --> 01:52:25,540
That is provocative...

789
01:52:25,748 --> 01:52:29,149
There have been a lot of refugee
stories in Reader's Digest...

790
01:52:29,352 --> 01:52:31,786
...about Cambodia.
Do you believe them?

791
01:52:31,987 --> 01:52:33,546
Don't you believe them?

792
01:52:33,757 --> 01:52:37,625
Maybe in this instance the
Reader's Digest happens to be correct.

793
01:52:37,828 --> 01:52:40,126
Do you apply the same disbelief
to stories...

794
01:52:40,330 --> 01:52:42,822
...that come out of Iran
or Palestine or Chile?

795
01:52:43,034 --> 01:52:45,400
Are refugees your next area
of interest?

796
01:52:45,603 --> 01:52:48,037
Will you be covering the boat people?

797
01:52:48,239 --> 01:52:49,365
No, I will not.

798
01:52:49,574 --> 01:52:51,270
Do you want a cup of tea?

799
01:52:52,244 --> 01:52:55,839
Are you looking around for some kind
of more salable suffering?

800
01:52:58,417 --> 01:53:01,046
I must have sent 500 letters.

801
01:53:06,559 --> 01:53:10,291
I wrote the International Red Cross,
the World Health Organization.

802
01:53:10,498 --> 01:53:13,194
I know you did, Syd.
You told me.

803
01:53:13,701 --> 01:53:15,965
I don't know who I didn't write to.

804
01:53:22,444 --> 01:53:25,106
I never really gave him any choice.

805
01:53:30,553 --> 01:53:33,681
One time we tried to discuss leaving.

806
01:53:42,633 --> 01:53:46,092
I talked to him about it,
but we never really discussed it.

807
01:53:49,407 --> 01:53:52,706
I discussed it with Swain and Rockoff.

808
01:53:56,715 --> 01:53:59,240
But I never discussed it with him.

809
01:54:10,430 --> 01:54:13,366
He stayed because
I wanted him to stay.

810
01:54:19,407 --> 01:54:21,272
And I stayed because...

811
01:58:00,719 --> 01:58:02,585
I'm trapped, Sydney.

812
01:58:02,788 --> 01:58:06,986
I know he suspects me,
and yet he treats me well.

813
01:58:07,626 --> 01:58:11,027
There are many different groups
over here, Sydney.

814
01:58:11,330 --> 01:58:13,424
I must take much care.

815
01:58:13,967 --> 01:58:18,028
Now Angka says we have new enemies.

816
01:58:18,572 --> 01:58:23,476
They say we must regain
our old lands from the Vietnamese.

817
01:58:24,245 --> 01:58:28,147
And now they say we must fight them.

818
01:58:29,952 --> 01:58:34,150
I miss you, my wife, my children.

819
01:58:34,356 --> 01:58:37,814
And my heart hungers for news of you.

820
01:59:01,953 --> 01:59:03,477
New China Radio reports...

821
01:59:03,688 --> 01:59:06,988
...that fighting between Vietnam
and Democratic Kampuchea...

822
01:59:07,193 --> 01:59:09,559
...has broken out
on a number of fronts.

823
01:59:09,829 --> 01:59:12,559
This is in retaliation,
according to the Vietnamese...

824
01:59:12,765 --> 01:59:15,199
...for a number of attacks
on border villages...

825
01:59:18,939 --> 01:59:20,304
Taxi driver, huh?

826
01:59:38,160 --> 01:59:39,991
I think you speak English.

827
01:59:40,462 --> 01:59:41,759
Sit down.

828
01:59:47,971 --> 01:59:50,496
You know, I love this country.

829
01:59:52,309 --> 01:59:55,108
I sacrificed everything for it.

830
01:59:56,581 --> 02:00:00,073
My wife died for the revolution.

831
02:00:01,987 --> 02:00:06,686
But the leaders of Angka
no longer trust the people.

832
02:00:07,626 --> 02:00:11,188
Therefore, I can no longer trust them.

833
02:00:13,032 --> 02:00:15,091
And they don't trust me.

834
02:00:17,604 --> 02:00:18,468
I fear...

835
02:00:19,873 --> 02:00:22,206
...really fear for the future.

836
02:00:26,614 --> 02:00:30,107
I think you love my son.

837
02:00:33,221 --> 02:00:34,483
For his sake...

838
02:00:35,557 --> 02:00:36,956
...look after him.

839
02:00:41,597 --> 02:00:44,191
The fighting is close by, Sydney.

840
02:00:44,400 --> 02:00:46,868
If the Vietnamese get here...

841
02:00:47,069 --> 02:00:49,231
...Angka will destroy everything...

842
02:00:51,375 --> 02:00:52,933
...and the Vietnamese,
they will find only ashes.

843
02:04:02,286 --> 02:04:05,722
I must try to stop the killing.
Good luck.

844
02:13:25,143 --> 02:13:27,043
Yeah, I'll be right there, Brian.

845
02:13:29,982 --> 02:13:33,941
Ann, get me 415-555-6421.

846
02:13:34,153 --> 02:13:35,848
Abe, I've got some great news!

847
02:13:49,070 --> 02:13:52,130
Twenty minutes ago, I get
a phone call from Paris.

848
02:13:52,340 --> 02:13:55,241
I get Andreas Freund.
He talked to Henry.

849
02:13:55,443 --> 02:13:57,537
He told him how to get in touch
with me.

850
02:13:57,746 --> 02:14:00,613
Freund says, "I have got
some great news for you."

851
02:14:00,816 --> 02:14:03,444
- San Francisco's on the line.
- "It's about Pran!"

852
02:14:03,819 --> 02:14:05,515
Is your mother there?

853
02:14:08,124 --> 02:14:09,284
When?

854
02:14:11,694 --> 02:14:14,357
All right,
I want you to get this down.

855
02:14:15,199 --> 02:14:17,861
No, write it down. Write it down.

856
02:14:19,403 --> 02:14:21,530
I've got a message from your dad!

857
02:15:34,486 --> 02:15:35,680
How you been?

858
02:15:48,769 --> 02:15:49,793
Do you forgive me?

859
02:15:50,504 --> 02:15:53,098
Nothing to forgive, Sydney.
Nothing.
