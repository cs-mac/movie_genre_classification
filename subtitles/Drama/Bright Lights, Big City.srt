1
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,835
It's Six A.M.
Do you know where you are?

2
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,199
# <i>Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh</i>

3
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,548
# <i>Oh, oh, oh-oh</i>

4
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,033
# <i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

5
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,593
<i> Yes.</i>

6
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,870
<i> I look at you...</i>
<i>and I know you're mine.</i>

7
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,710
<i>And I run my fingers through your... curis.</i>

8
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,913
<i>Some other giris,</i>
<i>they think a kiss is a contract.</i>

9
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,198
<i>When we kiss, we kiss with fire.</i>

10
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,198
<i>When we kiss, we kiss with passion.</i>

11
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,198
<i>When we kiss, we kiss with pain.</i>

12
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,076
<i>Don't fall in love.</i>

13
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,359
# <i>Just another touch of the love attack</i>

14
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,435
# <i>Get back, don't fight it</i>

15
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,949
# <i>Just another touch of the love attack</i>

16
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,354
Hey.

17
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,959
# <i>Just another touch...</i>

18
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,036
Hey!

19
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,116
Why so sad?

20
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,994
- What?
- Why so sad?

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,356
- I'm not sad.
- Trouble with a woman?

22
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,835
I'm...

23
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,918
- What?
- Trouble with a woman?

24
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,670
Something like that.

25
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,109
Do you want another drink? Last call.

26
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,871
Sure. Why not?

27
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,353
<i>You're not the kind of guy to be at a place</i>
<i>like this, at this time in the morning.</i>

28
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,234
<i>But here you are. And you can't say</i>
<i>that the terrain is entirely unfamiliar,</i>

29
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,079
<i>although you must admit</i>
<i>that the details are fuzzy.</i>

30
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,715
<i>You're the kind of guy who wakes up</i>
<i>to the smell of bread from the bakery,</i>

31
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,992
<i>goes out, brings back the paper</i>
<i>and croissants to your wife Amanda.</i>

32
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:05,112
<i>She left you a couple of months ago,</i>
<i>and here you are. How did you get here?</i>

33
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:09,631
<i>All might come clear if you could just do</i>
<i>a little more Bolivian marching powder.</i>

34
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,151
<i>But then again, this epidemic lack of</i>
<i>clarity is a result of too much of that.</i>

35
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,716
<i>Your brain is composed of</i>
<i>brigades of tiny Bolivian soldiers.</i>

36
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,277
<i>They're tired and muddy from their march</i>
<i>through the night and they're hungry.</i>

37
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,675
<i>They need to be fed.</i>

38
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,360
<i>They need the Bolivian marching powder.</i>

39
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,913
Hi. Got some blow?

40
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,709
- I love drugs!
- That's something we have in common.

41
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,638
Have you ever noticed
how the good words start with D?

42
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,751
D and L.

43
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,190
Drugs. Delight. Decadence.

44
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,880
- Debauchery.
- Dexedrine.

45
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,549
Delectable. Debilitated. Deranged.

46
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,069
- Delinquent.
- Delirious.

47
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,475
And L. Lush and luscious.

48
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,999
Languorous.

49
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,315
Librium.

50
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,000
- Libidinous.
- What's that?

51
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,636
Horny.

52
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,200
What, do you have
a problem with H words?

53
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,432
<i> OK, everyone.</i>
<i>The Palladium is now closed.</i>

54
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,917
<i>We'll reopen again tomorrow night</i>
<i>at 11, and hope to see you then.</i>

55
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,156
Barbara! Barbara!

56
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,716
- Where did Allagash go?
- He left a couple of hours ago.

57
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,153
Shit.

58
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,389
Shit.

59
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,073
Hey.

60
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,237
Morning. I only have a buck and a half.
When we get to my apartment...

61
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,316
- Go fuck yourself.
- Thank you.

62
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,313
MONDAY MORNING
Whatever happened to Sunday?

63
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,673
Yeah?

64
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,715
What time is it?

65
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,831
Oh, shit!

66
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,518
Oh, shit.

67
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,995
Is she there yet?

68
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,112
She looking for me? Oh, shit.

69
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,231
All right. Christ, Meg.

70
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,555
OK, I'm coming in.

71
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,952
<i>The "Post" is the most shameful</i>
<i>of your several addictions.</i>

72
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,232
<i>You're a secret fan of killer bees,</i>
<i>hero cops, sex fiends, lottery winners,</i>

73
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,672
<i>teenage terrorists, Liz Taylor, tough tots,</i>
<i>sicko creeps, living nightmares,</i>

74

<i>human combustion... coma babies.</i>

75
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,156
- Morning. Thanks.
- Hi.

76
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,833
Morning.

77
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,556
- Morning.
- Morning.

78
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,956
Good morning. Tardy, tardy, very tardy.

79
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,273
Good morning, Mr Conway.

80
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,630
May I speak to you in my office?

81
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,276
Close the door.

82
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,708
How nice to see you, Jamie.

83
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,035
Thank you, Clara. Nice to see you.

84
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,597
I wasn't sure you were keeping
office hours any more. Sit down.

85
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:25,038
Mr Vogel has decided to move
the French piece up an issue.

86
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,072
That means I need it on my desk
before you leave today.

87
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,475
- Is that clear?
- Quite clear.

88
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:35,958
I want every single fact verified
as per standard procedure.

89
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,753
I want the spelling of
every name double-checked,

90
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,032
I want every accent in place,
I want every figure correct.

91
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:47,950
If the writer gives the population
of France, find the exact figure -

92
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,996
man, woman and child - down to the last
baby born, the hour we go to press.

93
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,634
Is that clear?

94
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,715
Crystalline.

95
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:03,597
Because if there is one single mistake
in that article, whose fault will it be?

96
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,029
The writer's fault?

97
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,151
- My fault.
- Exactly.

98
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:12,319
And if I were you,
I would be on the phone to Paris <i>now,</i>

99
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,752
where it is five in the afternoon and
everyone is thinking of going home.

100
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,156
We know from your résumé
that you're fluent in French,

101
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,874
so this will be no problem for you.

102
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,355
Absolutely. No problem.

103
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,996
My desk.

104
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,951
My ass.

105
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,274
What?

106
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,349
Hello. <i>Vite, vite.</i>

107
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,233
<i>Allons-y travailler.</i>

108
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,953
Still got that nasty sinus problem, I see.

109
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,993
Jamie? Listen, do you
want some help with that?

110
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,236
- No, Meg, thanks.
- I'm not busy. Sure?

111
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,351
Yeah, I'm sure.

112
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,996
Absolutely. There's a certain
shabby nobility in failing all by myself.

113
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:19,239
Hi, Eleanor. Can you get those calls
through to Paris for me this morning?

114
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,033
Right, yeah. No, the same two ministries.

115
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,950
Uh-huh. And I need you
to get ahold of John Martin for me.

116
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,469
Right. You got that number?

117
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,670
Thanks.

118
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,110
Richard Rose? Richard <i>B</i> Rose.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

119
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,390
Jesus Christ.

120
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,232
Hello?

121
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,033
<i>- Ne quittez pas...</i>
<i>- Monsieur Conway, ne quittez pas.</i>

122
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,037
Oh! <i>Ne quittez pas.</i>

123
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,390
<i>Ne quittez pas. Oui. Je... Oui.</i>

124
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,670
Why did I put French on my résumé?

125
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,870
Jamie, you don't speak French?

126
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,393
<i>Pardon? Oui.</i>

127
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:03,399
<i>Oui. Je suis Monsieur Jamie Conway</i>
<i>des États-Unis.</i>

128
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,750
<i>- Oui, alors.</i>
<i>- Oui.</i>

129
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,155
<i>Je... Je travaille sur la...</i>

130
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,919
essay... <i>politique.</i>

131
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,554
Shit. I mean, <i>merde.</i>

132
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,353
<i>Pardon?</i>

133
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,955
- Uh... Hello?
- <i>Au revoir, monsieur.</i>

134
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,919
Hello?

135
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,996
Line went dead.

136
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,160
Mr Vogel. May I help you?

137
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,236
No, thank you.

138
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,600
- Clara?
- Hello, Mr Vogel.

139
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,312
- Headache?
- Yeah.

140
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,674
Um...

141
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,156
I need to go to the deli,
get a little nourishment.

142
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,989
- Want anything?
- I'd love a cheese Danish.

143
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,192
- All right. Anybody else want anything?
- No, thank you.

144
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,878
- Last chance.
- No, thanks.

145
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,753
Megan, if anybody calls, I'll be right back.

146
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,998
Mr Tyler. How's the travel section?

147
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,669
Ah, fine, fine.
Big piece on Tibet this week.

148
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,034
So how's that beautiful wife of yours?

149
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,152
She's fine. She's in Paris, modelling.

150
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:36,832
Really? I'm sure I saw her modelling
clothes on a TV talk show this weekend.

151
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,954
No, it must have been a rerun.

152
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:46,119
- I'd know if she was in town.
- Yeah, you'd certainly hope so.

153
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,355
So how's Clara behaving?

154
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,119
Same as usual,
like a fourth-grade tyrant.

155
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,596
I always wanted
to ask somebody, in fact...

156
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:01,196
does Clara piss in
the men's room or the ladies'?

157
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,879
- I don't believe she pisses.
-

158
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,558
Marvellous!

159
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,155
So how do you like it down here, in fact?

160
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,469
All in all, I'd rather be in fiction.

161
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,195
- You write, don't you?
- It seems to be a matter of opinion.

162
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,276
Read Hazlitt, that's my advice.

163
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,756
Read Hazlitt and write
before breakfast every day.

164
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,508
- OK, what can I do you for?
- Pastrami on rye.

165
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:45,679
- A little mustard today, Jamie?
- Yeah, mustard. Mustard and butter.

166
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,395
And butter. Just like
your mother made it, huh?

167
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,277
<i>- What do you know about it?</i>
<i>- That's how my mother used to make it.</i>

168
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:00,833
- That is just so unbelievable...
- Listen, I took two messages for you.

169
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,077
One from Monsieur Something
at the department of something.

170
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,158
And one from your brother Michael.

171
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,635
- Really?
- Yeah. He said it was urgent.

172
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,873
All right.

173
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,199
- Is Vogel still in there?
- Yeah.

174
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,276
Hm. I wonder what's going on.

175
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,991
- <i>Allô?</i>
- <i> Practising our French, are we?</i>

176
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,510
No, excuse me, ma'am.
I thought it was my call from Paris.

177
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,915
<i>Could you spare a moment</i>
<i>to see me in my office?</i>

178
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,393
Sure.

179
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,876
I'm about to find out.

180
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,669
Yes?

181
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,196
Close the door.

182
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,880
- Mr Vogel.
- Good afternoon.

183
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,395
- Something wrong?
- Did you verify the facts in this article?

184
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,194
"Precipitate" or "precipitous"?

185
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,996
Oh, yeah. Yes, yes.

186
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,076
Yes, I remember.

187
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,873
Mr Vogel called me up
and expressed his concern

188
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,151
about the president's
correct usage of the English language.

189
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,590
In this piece, the president
warns against "precipitous action".

190
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,156
Mr Vogel felt that "precipitate"
was the word that he was looking for.

191
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,635
- Correct.
- Go on.

192
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,108
Well, I called the White House.

193
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,550
I tried to explain to them
the importance of the distinction,

194
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,636
and I spent several hours on hold.

195
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,958
So, finally, with the composing room and
everybody screaming for the final pages,

196
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:35,835
I checked with <i>Webster's Third Edition,</i>
which listed them as synonymous.

197
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,436
- The third edition?
- Yeah.

198
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,439
I know that the second edition
gives different meanings for the words,

199
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,949
but the third edition's a lot racier.

200
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,910
Hello?

201
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,238
<i>- John Martin for you.</i>
- Hello, John Martin. Jamie Conway here.

202
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,797
<i>- We got a connection here? Hello?</i>
- Jamie. <i>Gotham</i> magazine.

203
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:03,552
Right. I'm checking facts on that piece
you wrote about the French elections.

204
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:09,391
- <i>I think you can go with that, Jamie.</i>
- That's great. It's really good. Right.

205
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:14,469
Where did you get this about the French
government and Paramount Pictures?

206
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,715
No. John...

207
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:23,834
No, I can't run a line through that.
The next three paragraphs depend on it.

208
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:28,112
- No, I just need to know if it's true or not.
- <i>He's very well connected.</i>

209
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,629
You heard it where?

210
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,479
- At a fucking cocktail party?
- <i>Come on, Jamie.</i>

211
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,876
- <i>I gotta go.</i>
- No! No, don't hang up.

212
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,753
<i>- Hold on.</i>
- All right, get the door. I'll hold.

213
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,356
Just call me back, all right?

214
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,679
This is gonna take all night.

215
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:05,637
Jamie, I want it on my desk
before you leave.

216
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,558
I've left my door unlocked.

217
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,840
- Jimmy. Good to see you.
- Mr Allagash. How are you?

218
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,713
Good. A vodka on the rocks,
and can I borrow your phone?

219
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,796
- You got it.
- Thank you.

220
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,911
Hello? Hello?

221
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,509
What are you doing at the office?
Monstrous events are scheduled.

222
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,599
<i>What happened to you Saturday? I had</i>
<i>to walk home. I couldn't pay for a cab.</i>

223
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,836
- I left.
- <i>Yeah, I know.</i>

224
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:20,239
I took this bimbo back to her place. Did
some of her off-the-boat quality drugs.

225
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:24,478
We scooped it out of these Ming vases,
did it off each other's naked bodies.

226
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,797
- It was fucking beautiful, man.
- Bullshit.

227
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,434
- <i>No, it's true.</i>
- God, I hate you.

228
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:34,269
Let me tell you about tonight. Elaine
and Theresa are dying to meet you.

229
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,709
Theresa's father owns an oil company.

230
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,354
Elaine is soon to be in
a major TV commercial.

231
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:43,758
And I think I have cornered
a big chunk of Bolivia's national product.

232
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:49,917
I'm gonna be working most of the night.
Then I'm gonna go home and sleep.

233
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,996
Give me a time. I'll pick you up.

234
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,708
Call me in half an hour.
I gotta finish this.

235
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,709
- I'll see you in a while. Bye-bye.
- <i>Bye.</i>

236
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,756
Thanks a lot, Jimmy.

237
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,436
There you go, Clara.

238
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,476
Read it and weep.

239
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,753
Good night.

240
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:40,429
# <i>It's all right, pretty baby</i>

241
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:44,553
# <i>Gonna need my help someday</i>

242
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:50,232
# <i>Whoa, it's all right, pretty baby</i>

243
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,915
"He was expecting her
on the afternoon flight from Paris

244
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:58,350
when she called to say
she would not be coming home."

245
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,596
"'Taking a later flight? ' he asked."

246
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,479
"'No', she said. 'I'm starting a new life."'

247
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:10,760
# <i>Go ahead, pretty baby</i>

248
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,668
# <i>Honey, knock yourself out</i>

249
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:20,875
# <i>Oh, go ahead, pretty baby</i>

250
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,278
# <i>Honey, knock yourself out</i>

251
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,709
# <i>I still love ya, baby</i>

252
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,799
# <i>Cos you don't know what it's all about</i>

253
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,516
Screw it.

254
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:10,392
# <i>Bright lights, big city</i>

255
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,909
# <i>Gone to my baby's head</i>

256
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:18,392
# <i>Oh, bright lights, big city</i>

257
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,868
- Who is it?
- Narcotics squad.

258
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,356
We're soliciting donations
for children without drugs.

259
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,268
- Would you open the door, please?
- Yeah. One minute. Hang on, Tad.

260
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,555
- Ready to roll? The giris are waiting.
- Where are we rolling to?

261
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,796
Into the heart of the night.

262
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:42,230
Wherever there are dances to be danced,
drugs to be hoovered,

263
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,874
women to be Allagashed.

264
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,560
It's a dirty job,
but somebody's got to do it.

265
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,752
- Speaking of drugs, you in possession?
- Negative.

266
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,713
- Not even a single line for young Tad?
- Sorry.

267
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,912
- Not even a mirror to lick?
- Jesus. Help yourself.

268
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,556
Where the fuck did you get this?

269
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,194
I inherited that from my grandmother.

270
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,788
Oh, Christ. I gotta change this shirt.

271
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,469
- There's something on here.
- Yeah, that's dust, Tad.

272
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:15,675
It's probably got better coke content
than some of the shit we buy by the gram.

273
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,438
D'you know that 90 of household dust
is composed of human epidermal matter?

274
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:27,269
- That's skin to you.
- That's why I'm thinking about Amanda.

275
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,436
She left her skin behind.

276
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:33,872
Doing a little writing, are we?
Yeah! "Dead Amanda."

277
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,471
I told you you'd get more nooky
if you just told people your wife was dead.

278
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,478
- I hit the wrong key.
- It's the sympathy vote that counts.

279
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:46,628
It's a lot better than saying she fit you
with horns and kited off to Paris.

280
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,194
Are you sure you have no drugs?

281
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,073
I think there's some Robitussin
in the bathroom.

282
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,156
I'm disappointed in you, coach.

283
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:58,159
I figured you for the kind of guy
who saves something for a rainy day.

284
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:01,590
- I've fallen in with bad companions.
-

285
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,675
Maybe Amanda died in a plane crash.

286
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:09,078
She was coming home from Paris
on the day of your first anniversary.

287
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,316
That's fuckin' beautiful.

288
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,000
Come on, Warner.
Answer the goddamn phone.

289
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,756
Shit!

290
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:26,591
I know that asshole's sitting in his loft on
top of a pile of toot, ignoring the phone.

291
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,280
It's 11 o'clock.
It's a little early for Odeon,

292
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:34,474
but once we're downtown, it'll be happy
hunting ground for sneeze and squeeze.

293
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:39,071
Do you ever have an overwhelming desire
to just spend a quiet evening at home?

294
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,156
No!

295
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,796
- Elaine. Theresa.
- Hi.

296
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,876
- This is Jamie Conway.
- Hi.

297
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,718
- Hi, Jamie.
- Hi. How are you?

298
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:54,516
- Aren't you Amanda White's boyfriend?
- Husband. Yeah, I was.

299
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:59,316
You didn't hear? She was in Paris and
got hit by a burst of terrorist crossfire.

300
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,352
Palestinians, French police...
A real fluke thing.

301
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,438
Senseless death.
She was an innocent bystander.

302
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,755
Jamie doesn't like to talk about it.

303
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,758
- That's terrible.
- Yeah...

304
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,476
A tragedy. I have to take care of some
business, but you'll take care of him?

305
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,393
- Is that true?
- Not really, no.

306
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,476
What is Amanda doing these days?

307
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,512
She's in Paris doing
the Oscar de la Renta collection.

308
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,996
- Wait a minute. Is she alive?
- We sort of split up.

309
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,671
Too bad for you. She was yummy.

310
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,110
Sort of the slinky girl-next-door look.
Very ingenuous.

311
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,118
- I don't understand this.
- Neither do I.

312
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,470
- Aren't you a writer?
- I do some writing.

313
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,795
More of an editor.
<i>Gotham</i> magazine.

314
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,310
God, I've been reading it all my life.
I mean, my parents get it.

315
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,433
I read it at the gynaecologist. What's
your name again? Should I know you?

316
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:57,997
I haven't been published yet, but
they have a couple of my short stories.

317
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,429
Got my fingers crossed.

318
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,551
Matter of time.

319
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,317
Don't you want a drink?

320
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,113
Yeah. Yeah, that'd be great.

321
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,196
Too late.

322
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,276
Bingo.

323
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,157
Seems like I spend
about half my life in bathrooms.

324
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,712
- Hey, Bruno. Two vodkas.
- You got it.

325
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,956
Hey, Jamie.

326
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,398
Hey, Rich.

327
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,273
- Rich, when'd you get back?
- I can't hear you.

328
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,356
Where's Amanda?

329
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,392
I'm sorry. That's terrible.

330
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,555
Jamie, I'm so sorry.

331
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,195
Two Stolis on the rocks.

332
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,755
Here we go. Did you have
the vodka or the vodka?

333
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,314
- No margarita?
- No margarita. Vodka.

334
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,634
- Vodka.
- Thanks.

335
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,113
Jamie!

336
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,476
What did you say to them?

337
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,669
What?

338
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,234
What did you say to Rich and Kathy?

339
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,999
I told them Amanda died of leukaemia.

340
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,078
- What?
- I told them Amanda died of leukaemia.

341
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,953
That's not funny.
My mom died of cancer.

342
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,638
Jamie.

343
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,476
I'm sorry.

344
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,275
- What was that about?
- I just said something in really bad taste.

345
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,958
Oh, Jamie.

346
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:14,634
I'm so sorry about Amanda. She was such
a pretty girl and you made a great couple.

347
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:18,070
It's all right, Kathy. She's not dead.

348
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,350
- What? She's not dead?
- No, she's not dead.

349
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,040
He's pulling your leg. She's in Paris.

350
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,309
Oh.

351
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,795
- She's doing a shoot.
- Oh.

352
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:36,038
- Well, did you break up or something?
- Sort of. Maybe. I don't know.

353
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,593
Oh.

354
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,676
Wanna dance?

355
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,553
- No, not right now. Maybe later?
- OK.

356
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,636
All right. Later.

357
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,476
- I tried.
- Where are the giris?

358
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,192
Bathroom.

359
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,117
- Without me?
- I guess so.

360
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,391
- You gonna come?
- No, I'll catch you on the rebound.

361
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,674
Excuse me, ladies. Coming in.

362
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,030
Hi. How you doin'?

363
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,229
Fine.

364
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,713
All right.

365
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,996
Hey, save some for me.

366
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,836
Wanna join the party?

367
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,198
No, thanks. <i>Bon appétit.</i>

392
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:50,759
I like it in here.
Everything I need is pumped in.

393
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,750
Mom's on her way out.

394
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,714
Hey, if the old lady goes,
then I'm going with her.

00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:16,151
Come out. Listen to me,
you've gotta come out.

398
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,275
Open up. It's the doctor.

401
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,994
<i> Jamie?</i>

402
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,439
<i>Oui.</i>

403
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:49,030
<i>Hi, it's Megan. I just wanted</i>
<i>to make sure you were awake.</i>

404
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,073
Oh, yeah? Are you kidding me, Megan?

405
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,636
I'm making breakfast.
I'm making sausage and eggs.

406
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:00,958
<i>I hope you don't mind, but I didn't want</i>
<i>you getting in Dutch with Clara again.</i>

407
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,436
She's not here yet, but I wanted
to make sure you were awake.

408
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:08,235
<i>- You sure you're awake?</i>
- Certainly feels like it.

409
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:12,558
Headache. Queasy stomach.
All the vital signs. I'll be right there.

410
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:30,958
TUESDAY
You should have called in sick.

411
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,396
I'll get it.

412
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,073
Hello?

413
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,156
Michael, hello.

414
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,192
No, he's not here yet,
but I expect him any minute.

415
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,596
He didn't get back to you yesterday?
I told him you called.

416
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,555
Yes, absolutely. I'll tell him.

417
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,796
- Morning.
- You just missed your brother.

418
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,673
You should call him right away.
It sounds important.

419
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,756
- Where's Clara?
- Still not here.

420
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:20,031
I just had a call from Clara.
She's sick. She won't be in today.

421
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:24,358
- Nothing fatal, I hope.
- I'm to distribute the assignments.

422
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,995
- Did you finish the French piece?
- More or less.

423
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:31,795
If she's not coming in, maybe I can
take one last look, make sure it's OK.

424
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,911
She had it sent over to typesetting.

425
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:37,430
She even had a photocopy
messengered to her apartment.

426
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,429
Jeez.

427
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:43,917
Why does she hate me so much?
It's not my fault she never got married.

428
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:49,153
- I think she's determined to get me fired.
- Not possible.

429
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,273
The magazine has a tradition
of never acknowledging its mistakes.

430
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,472
- She's not gonna fire you, Jamie.
- I'm not so sure.

431
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,513
Mm.

432
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,471
She's got a heart like a 12-minute egg.

433
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,595
Let's see now.

434
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:11,918
First in a long series
on cancer research.

435
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,951
Megan.

436
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:18,278
<i>An inventor who's received his hundredth</i>
<i>patent for a nose-hair clipping device.</i>

437
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,674
Yasu.

438
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,950
Here's an amusing one for you, Jamie.

439
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:27,029
A meeting of the Society of
Polar Explorers at the Sherry-Netherland.

440
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,268
All right, good.
So there was such an event.

441
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:37,349
Uh-huh. And you did serve smoked
emperor penguin on Triscuits. Great.

442
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:40,392
Wait, one more thing. Yeah. Uh...

443
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:45,878
Is it true that somebody wore
a headdress made out of walrus skin?

444
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,116
God, I'll be damned.

445
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,595
No, that's it. Great. Thanks. Bye.

446
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,598
All right. Facts are stranger than fiction.

447
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,520
OK. Polar explorer piece is put to bed.

448
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,634
I'm gonna grab a bite.
Anybody want anything?

449
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:07,550
- I'd love a bagel. Toasted. No butter.
- You would. Bagel, toasted, no butter.

450
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,153
Afternoon.

451
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,757
Mr Hardy?

452
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,555
I was just thinking
it could use some fish.

453
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:33,990
All water coolers could use some fish.

454
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:38,875
The old crew in the great days of
this magazine would have thought of it.

455
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,878
Siamese fighting fish in the water cooler.

456
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:47,349
What's your name now?
I know. It's on the tip of my tongue.

457
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,040
- Jamie Conway.
- Jamie Conway!

458
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:55,798
Jamie Conway... Didn't you send
a story to us in the fiction department?

459
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,275
Yeah. Yes.

460
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,356
Yes, several months ago.

461
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,391
- Did you read it?
- Oh, yes.

462
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,512
A lower-case Scott Fitzgerald
without the crackup.

463
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,596
I guess you could say that, yeah.

464
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,716
You got a cough. Here.

465
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:16,515
I knew Fitzgerald's friend,
Bunny Wilson, you know.

466
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,198
Yeah, I know.

467
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,676
The only great American man of letters.

468
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,358
- Where are you headed?
- I was going out to lunch.

469
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,710
Good. I'll join you.

470
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,796
Refresh my memory. What's it about?

471
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,276
A young writer goes to Kansas City,
meets a beautiful girl.

472
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,198
They marry, come to New York City,
she models.

473
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,430
They start going out, start doing drugs...

474
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:42,599
Very interesting style.
Very interesting sense of story.

475
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,871
Good sense of character,
a sense of place.

476
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,355
I assume it's autobiographical.

477
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,755
Ah! Phew.

478
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,713
- A couple more, please.
- I'm still nursing this one.

479
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:57,833
It reminds me of the kind of stuff
I used to write when I was a kid.

480
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:02,715
I started off as office boy at the magazine.
I got published every so often.

481
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:06,594
I used to write satirical sketches
on Manhattan highlife.

482
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,632
I know. I used to read that stuff. Amazing.

483
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,832
Yeah. A lot more fun than being an editor.

484
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:18,318
All I do as an editor is read a lot
of undisciplined, untalented crap.

485
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,196
- Your table's ready.
- Thanks.

486
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,756
Don't forget the two drinks.
Come on, right over here. This way.

487
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,633
So what are you working on now?

488
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,790
I'm... thinking about writing a novel.

489
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,275
I've been making some notes.

490
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:43,439
I'm just having a hard time
actually sitting down and writing.

491
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,075
My wife left me, so...

492
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:51,629
It sounds corny,
but I've been doing a lot of suffering.

493
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:55,431
Have you ever considered
getting an MBA?

494
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,714
- Absolutely not.
- I'm not saying go into business.

495
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,115
No, but write about it. That's the stuff.

496
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:07,791
Right now, the guys who understand
business will be writing the new literature.

497
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,275
Money is poetry now.

498
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,276
I don't want to believe that.

499
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:18,076
It may be true, but, no,
I don't want to believe that.

500
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:23,115
Don't be seduced by all that crap
about garrets and art, like I was.

501
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,355
Write about money.

502
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,436
A couple more!

503
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:37,156
I knew some of the giants.
I knew Bill Faulkner.

504
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,396
Yeah, we had a lot of fun.

505
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,718
We used to go to Musso's and
get pissed for lunch and roar around.

506
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:47,310
Talk about everything under the sun.

507
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:52,355
Women, life, death, art...
but most of all we talked about work.

508
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,119
About commitment.

509
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,913
- About not selling out.
- I gotta go.

510
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:01,794
- No! Have one more for the road.
- No, I can't, Alex. I can't.

511
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,158
So you think I've got some talent?

512
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,829
- I'm not just wasting my time?
- How do I know?

513
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:16,353
One little story - I can't tell from one little
story. Anyone can write one little story.

514
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,749
- Let me...
- No, save it.

515
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,235
This is on me. It's all right.

516
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,793
Thanks.

517
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,673
Amanda.

518
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,073
Amanda...

519
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,476
- Amanda!
- In here.

520
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,673
Amanda.

521
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,598
Sorry I took so long.
It's pouring. I couldn't get a cab.

522
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,915
That's OK. Here.

523
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:31,192
- It's OK. We're just starting.
- Here. Put this all over your face.

524
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:35,590
This is my husband Jamie,
the writer I was telling you about.

525
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,756
- This is Luigi.
- How you doin'?

526
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,199
And Lucas.

527
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,470
Just the head?
I thought it was the body.

528
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:45,149
I was looking forward to seeing you
lying naked in a vat of latex batter.

529
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,236
No, just my head.

530
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:50,989
- Wait a minute, how do I breathe?
- We'll put straws in your nose.

531
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,239
Sounds familiar.

532
00:41:56,040 --> 00:42:00,830
I didn't know you were gonna stay that
long. You never said you'd be that long.

533
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,635
I checked the messages.
There's a party at Magique tonight.

534
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:09,038
And your agent called. She said
that your flight leaves at ten tomorrow.

535
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:13,597
And she said that you should
be prepared to stay the full two weeks.

536
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:17,872
You never said anything about
staying that long. I didn't hear about that.

537
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,276
-
- You OK? What's the matter? Amanda?

538
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,960
- She's OK.
- Hey, Amanda.

539
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,031
- You OK?
- She's OK. Don't be scared.

540
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,754
- All right. Fine. Are you all right?
- Mm-hm.

541
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,031
I love you. Just relax, OK? Relax.

542
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:37,199
<i>It's OK. Amanda? I love you.</i>

543
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,276
She's back.

544
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,235
She's in town.

545
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,196
Click Modeling Agency.
May I help you?

546
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:01,198
This Andrew Carrington,
the photographer.

547
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:05,074
I'm in town and interested in working
with Amanda White. Is she in New York?

548
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:10,069
Yes. She's doing the Oscar de la Renta
show at the Parsons School of Design

549
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:13,556
- Thursday afternoon.
- Marvellous. Terrific. Thanks.

550
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,477
- Yeah?
- <i>Mr Conway's on the line.</i>

551
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:25,912
- I'll take it. Jamie.
- <i>I gotta talk to you. Meet me at Cybelle's.</i>

552
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,031
- I'm really busy.
- <i>You gotta meet me.</i>

553
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:32,472
- What's the matter?
- I'll explain when I see you. Just be there.

554
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:38,279
Camellia, I'm gonna take the
rest of the afternoon off.

555
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:41,556
How you doin'?

556
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,236
Double vodka, please.

557
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:51,312
- Hey. What's the big deal?
- I need a favour.

558
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,398
That's funny, so do I.
What you drinking?

559
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:57,114
- Double vodka.
- The same, please. Thanks.

560
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:59,356
You go first. What's yours?

561
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:03,189
Tonight, I have a very steamy
engagement with the glorious Inge.

562
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,914
- Which one is Inge?
- The aspiring actress.

563
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:10,750
- New York is full of aspiring actresses.
- Yeah, well, Inge was also Miss August.

564
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,155
- <i>Penthouse</i> Miss August?
- You got it.

565
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,270
- The one with the parrot?
- That's Inge.

566
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:20,668
Unfortunately,
my cousin Vicky is in town today.

567
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:25,316
She's a grad student at Princeton.
She's on some academic gig at NYU.

568
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,876
I promised her I'd pick her up early,
take her to dinner.

569
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,991
This is where you gotta help me out.

570
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:34,271
- Why do I envision a prig with glasses?
- Hey, hey.

571
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,916
She's an Allagash. She has Allagash
genes. She's a very attractive lady.

572
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,280
She'll also inherit a little Allagash money.

573
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,277
That's all right.

574
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,391
Can't let me down, coach.

575
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:51,878
Anything I possess, including
some of Bolivia's finest, is yours.

576
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:58,637
All right. OK, I'll tell you what.
I'll have dinner with your canine cousin...

577
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:00,557
Good.

578
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:05,071
...if you get me into the Oscar de la Renta
show at Parsons Art School, Thursday.

579
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:08,556
Amanda's in town.
She's working that show.

580
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,556
I know.

581
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:18,113
OK.

582
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:41,436
Excuse me? You wouldn't happen to be
Vicky, would you? Allagash's cousin?

583
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:42,959
- Yeah. Hi.
- Hi. Jamie.

584
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:45,435
- He told you, right?
- He did.

585
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,269
Good. Right.

586
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:52,073
- Sorry I'm so late.
- It's OK. I was looking around.

587
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,316
- This is a great bookstore.
- Yeah.

588
00:45:56,080 --> 00:46:00,471
It's a little early for dinner. You wanna
do something? You wanna get a drink?

589
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:03,751
- All right.
- We could just go for a walk.

590
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,158
All right.

591
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:10,558
- Where are you from?
- Up near Marblehead. Allagash country.

592
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:14,559
- How about you?
- Bucks County. Your parents?

593
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:17,035
They divorced three years ago. Yours?

594
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,435
- A happy marriage.
- You're lucky.

595
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,154
- Any brothers or sisters?
- Yeah, I have a brother.

596
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,713
I have a brother too.

597
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:28,199
- So what did Tad tell you about me?
- Not much.

598
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,797
Not much.

599
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:33,639
What did he say?

600
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,672
He raved. He tried to build you up.

601
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:42,158
I was expecting a field hockey player
with thick glasses and lockjaw.

602
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,797
What did he tell you about me?

603
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,911
- Not much.
- Come on.

604
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:56,392
He said you were a cross between
a young F Scott Fitz-Hemingway

605
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:58,590
and the later Wittgenstein.

606
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,440
- That's it? Nothing else?
- Nothing else.

607
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:09,238
Tad is a great guy.
Tad is a helluva guy.

608
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:16,110
You gotta admire his style, his <i>joie de</i>
<i>vivre,</i> his savoir-faire, his <i>sprezzatura.</i>

609
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,955
He's not necessarily the man
for a heart-to-heart, but he...

610
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:25,153
He's been a good friend to me
in a time of need and...

611
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,829
And he's generous in his own
careless way. Are you two close?

612
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,474
- I think he's an ass.
- Exactly.

613
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:34,558
I gotta go and wash my hands.
I'll be right back.

614
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:59,039
Let's see if it's possible to get through the
evening without chemicals for a change.

615
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,997
Tell me about your job.
I guess I'm supposed to be impressed.

616
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:10,033
Don't be. I don't like it much
and they don't like me, so it works out.

617
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:13,197
I know people who would <i>kill</i>
for a job like that.

618
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:15,550
Actually, it's pretty tedious.

619
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:19,912
When I first started, I thought it would be
my first step towards literary glory,

620
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:24,079
and it was just a matter of time before
I joined the roster of famous writers.

621
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:28,352
All I do is pore over encyclopaedias,
dictionaries and government pamphlets.

622
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,596
It's not very creative.

623
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:34,793
I've only just met you, but that doesn't
really seem like your kind of job to me.

624
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:37,593
Yeah, I don't think it is.

625
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:40,678
Well, I've really gotta go now.
This is my car.

626
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:44,757
Oh. I wish you didn't.

627
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,189
Yeah, me too.

628
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:49,914
- You have my number, right?
- Right.

629
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:52,076
You should call me.

630
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,156
Yeah, I'd like to.

631
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:27,675
Drive safe.

632
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,157
WEDNESDAY

633
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:53,592
You should have checked
your horoscope in THE POST.

634
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,718
- Jamie.
- Hey.

635
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:17,037
Clara's in a rage.
She says the French piece is a mess,

636
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:19,594
but it's too late to pull it
from the issue.

637
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:21,676
- She said it was a mess?
- Yep.

638
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:24,951
She's got Vogel in her office right now.

639
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:28,390
How bad could it be?
You got most of it done, didn't you?

640
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:32,396
I really don't know.

641
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:35,114
- She said it was a mess?
- A mess.

642
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:53,354
I would like to see you
in my office immediately.

643
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,436
She said it was a mess.

644
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:31,200
I would like to know what happened.

645
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,639
I screwed up?

646
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:39,115
You screwed up.

647
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:47,192
May I be so bold as to ask
for a little elaboration?

648
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:52,510
Really, I'm interested.
Just how did you screw up, exactly?

649
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,753
Well?

650
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:01,195
Do you realise just how serious this is?

651
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:04,915
You have endangered
the reputation of this magazine.

652
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:09,989
We have built a reputation for scrupulous
accuracy with regard to matters of fact.

653
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:13,396
Do you know that
in 50 years of publication

654
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:16,592
there has been
only one printed retraction?

655
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:21,394
Can I ask what errors you found exactly?

656
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,119
Two accents reversed.

657
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:36,155
An electoral district in Central France,
incorrectly identified as Northern.

658
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:40,549
A minister ascribed to
the wrong department.

659
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:45,470
This is just what I've found so far.
I'm scared to death of what I'll uncover.

660
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:49,595
The proofs are a mess. I can't tell
what you have or haven't verified.

661
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:53,429
The point is, you have not
followed standard procedure

662
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:55,869
which should be second nature to you,

663
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,833
which procedure
is thoroughly outlined in your manual,

664
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:02,396
which procedure is the net result
of years of collective labour,

665
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:06,991
and the proper application of which
ensures that, in so far as possible,

666
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:10,635
errors of fact
do not appear in this magazine.

667
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:16,878
Do you have anything to say for yourself?

668
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:22,957
- I don't think so.
- This isn't the first time.

669
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:26,390
I've given you
the benefit of the doubt before.

670
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:30,672
You seem to be unable to perform
the duties required for this job.

671
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,950
I'd like to hear what you have to say.

672
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,315
I assume I'm fired.

673
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:47,596
That's correct. Effective immediately.

674
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,275
Anything else?

675
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,118
I'm sorry.

676
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:59,955
I know you are.

677
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:06,957
- Well?
- It was nice working with you.

678
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:09,355
- No. She didn't? She couldn't.
- Yes, she did.

679
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:13,439
- What exactly did she say?
- The gist of it was that I'm fired.

680
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:17,599
You didn't have enough time. Everybody
knows John Martin's research is sloppy.

681
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:20,598
- She can't do that.
- Go to the arbitration committee.

682
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:24,235
- The way they handled the schedule...
- Look, it doesn't matter!

683
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:26,635
- I'll clean this up tomorrow.
- Jamie...

684
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:31,518
Listen, can we have lunch tomorrow?

685
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:37,995
I'd really like to talk to you.

686
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:41,350
Yeah, Meg. Sure.

687
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:43,436
Are you all right?

688
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,593
Well...

689
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:52,112
Oh, your brother called again.
He says he's gotta talk to you.

690
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:54,595
I don't wanna talk to my brother.

691
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,670
Lunch. Tomorrow.

692
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,756
Don't forget.

693
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:18,719
You wanna buy a ferret?

694
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:23,040
No. No, thanks.

695
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:28,439
Loose joints? Genuine Hawaiian sens.

696
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:34,993
His name is Fred.

697
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:38,874
- What else you got?
- Monkeys, boas, coke.

698
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,840
- How much?
- $50 a half.

699
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:46,513
Half what? Half borax, half mannitol?

700
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:49,552
Pure stuff. Uncut.

701
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:51,033
Sure.

702
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:56,399
No, I can't make the 50. If it's 50...

703
00:56:56,520 --> 00:57:00,115
- If it's 50, I can't buy Fred.
- You're gonna buy Fred too?

704
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:03,789
- How much is he?
- I'll make you a good deal.

705
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:08,396
One more.

706
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,156
This is it.

707
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:18,836
- Step a little lighter.
-

708
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:42,200
- It's locked.
- No problem.

709
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:55,311
-
- Calm down, Fred. Give me the leash.

710
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,396
- I don't have it.
- I gave it to you.

711
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:00,830
- I don't have it.
- All right. Let me just put him in a drawer.

712
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:03,997
Hold this. All right.

713
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:08,557
Calm down, Fred. You're about to become
the mascot for the whole department.

714
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:11,478
A real live ferret for the fact checkers.

715
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:12,953
OK.

716
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:18,357
- Let him out.
- Fuck, no. You let him out.

717
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:22,075
- OK, but hold the flashlight.
- I'll hold the flashlight.

718
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:24,031
All righty.

719
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,798
OK. Easy now.

720
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,876
Hi, Fred. Hi, buddy.

721
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:31,957
Oh, Jesus! Get it off! Get it off!

722
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:34,992
Throw it! Throw it!

723
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:36,758
Not at me!

724
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:38,632
Argh!

725
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:39,988
Argh!

726
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:41,633
- Ah!
- Jesus Christ!

727
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:45,878
- Jamie, get this fucking thing off me!
- I can't. I'm bleeding here, Tad.

728
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:49,239
Jesus Christ! Get the fuck off of me!

729
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:51,430
Jamie!

730
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:56,156
Oh, my God.

731
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:57,838
Come here, let me see.

732
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:59,916
- Oh, shit.
- Jesus.

733
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:02,955
Look at this.

734
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:05,833
One more inch...

735
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:09,077
- Oh, God.
- What's going on in here?

736
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,760
- Oh, fuck.
- Is the door locked?

737
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:13,438
Oh, shit.

738
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,835
I know you're in there.

739
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:30,350
Pygmies. I'm surrounded by pygmies.

740
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:34,796
Alex, hi.

741
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:40,558
I lost my wallet in here this morning.
I just came back to find it.

742
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:42,875
- Got it.
- He found it.

743
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,719
- I knew the giants.
- Yeah.

744
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:49,435
I worked with the giants.
Guys whose words...

745
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:55,110
...words went out into the worid
and kicked some ass.

746
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:56,912
All right! OK.

747
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,349
Giris, then. Women, whatever.

748
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:03,234
Lillian Hellman, Katherine Anne Porter,
Anaïïs Nin and Dorothy Parker.

749
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:07,069
I'm talking talent here, male or female.

750
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:11,034
Not like these precious turds
around today.

751
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:15,312
These goddamn pygmies
and their pygmy talent.

752
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,396
- Fred.
-

753
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:18,589
Jesus.

754
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:21,473
What the hell is that thing?

755
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,315
Oh, no.

756
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:37,439
- Let's get outta here.
- I can't leave him like this.

757
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:41,599
- What? You wanna explain this? Let's go.
- Shit! Just a minute.

758
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:43,676
- All right, Alex?
- He's fine.

759
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:45,756
Get the suitcase.

760
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:50,950
- Where's Fred?
- He went down the hall.

761
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:53,036
Fred. Freddie...

762
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:58,358
- Fuck Fred. Let's get outta here.
- You're on your own, Fred.

763
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:05,555
Fitz... and Faulkner.

764
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:10,836
Faulkner and Theodore... Dreiser.

765
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:13,633
I can't remember when
I had my last tetanus shot.

766
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,956
I wonder if it needs stitches.

767
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:17,149
Ow!

768
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:18,952
Let me see.

769
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:21,036
- Nah, I don't think so.
- No?

770
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:25,836
If Fred was rabid, he wouldn't have been
so friendly before you put him in the case.

771
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:31,273
I hear rabies shots are really painful. They
put needles in your dick or something.

772
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:32,753
Give me your hand.

773
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:33,835
Oh! Oh! Oh!

774
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:35,393
Great. Shit.

775
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:38,671
So much for antiseptic.
Now for anaesthetic.

776
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:40,916
I can see the headline in the <i>Post</i> now:

777
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:43,679
"Faulkner Friend
Falls Afoul of Furry Fiend."

778
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:48,749
<i>"De casibus virorum illustrium",</i>
as we used to say in the old Latin class.

779
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:52,998
- What does that mean?
- Something about the fall of famous men.

780
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:56,835
- Yeah.
- Hey.

781
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:59,520
- Don't answer that.
- I think it's Warner.

782
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:02,276
Heartbreak Hotel.

783
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:06,874
- Yo, Michael.
- I'm not home. No.

784
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:11,188
How's it going on the home front?

785
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:13,880
Yeah. No, Jamie's not here right now.

786
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:17,675
Amanda's not here either.

787
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:22,917
Me? I'm sitting here watering the plants.
They got this real thirsty jade tree.

788
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:25,395
Yeah. Would I kid you, Michael?

789
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:29,238
Yeah. No, I think
they took off to the Hamptons.

790
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:34,391
Yeah. Look, Michael, I gotta take off.
I'm gonna leave a message, I promise.

791
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:36,272
Bye-bye.

792
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:40,109
What's wrong with Michael?
He sounds really upset.

793
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:42,196
I don't wanna talk about it.

794
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:43,673
OK.

795
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:54,236
I almost forgot.

796
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:56,999
Here's the invitation to the fashion show.

797
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:00,038
Jesus Christ.

798
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:06,588
Thanks a lot for taking Vicky off my hands
last night. Inge is eternally grateful.

799
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:08,676
My pleasure.

800
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:13,838
- Really? You got lucky, did you?
- None of your goddamn business.

801
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:26,358
You never really
liked Amanda much, did you?

802
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:28,835
God knows she wasn't hard to look at.

803
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:36,120
I don't know why
you felt like you had to marry her.

804
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:38,231
Yeah.

805
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:40,316
I've been wondering the same thing.

806
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:44,558
- Did you see the sign on her forehead?
- What sign?

807
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:47,672
"Space to let.
Long and short-term leasing."

808
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:54,636
We met in a bar.
It was too dark to read.

809
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,834
THURSDAY
Facing the Facts.

810
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:25,476
Your invitation, please.

811
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:29,149
- Has it started yet?
- Just. You'll have to sit in the back.

812
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:33,040
- Double vodka.
- The bar's closed.

813
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:39,316
One for my date, too.

814
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:31,395
Amanda.

815
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:32,589
Amanda!

816
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,358
Amanda...

817
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:36,835
Amanda, I want an explanation.

818
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:41,071
Amanda! I want answers.
I want an explanation.

819
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:43,668
I wanna know why.
I just wanna know why.

820
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:45,916
Amanda? Amanda, I want answers!

821
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:47,996
I just wanna know why!

822
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:49,189
Amanda?

823
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:51,356
Amanda, you owe me.

824
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:54,793
- You owe me an explanation!
- Let's go.

825
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:57,514
- That's my wife.
- You're outta here, pal!

826
01:06:57,640 --> 01:06:59,710
- You're outta here!
- Amanda!

827
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:01,353
Amanda!

828
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:04,356
You're outta here, buddy.

829
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:12,876
Stay outta here!

830
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:33,433
Jamie?

831
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,956
Jamie.

832
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:49,557
Jamie!

833
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:51,636
Jamie, stop!

834
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:04,113
Jamie!

835
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:06,196
Jamie, stop! It's me, Michael.

836
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:21,395
Jamie!

837
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:26,109
Jamie!

838
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:33,520
Hi. Remember me?

839
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:39,718
I remember something
about a lunch date.

840
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:42,996
Damn.

841
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:45,836
I'm sorry.

842
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:02,311
By the way, whatever happened
to my bagel? Toasted, no butter.

843
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:07,476
How about dinner?

844
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:10,672
One more meal with you
could be the death of me.

845
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:23,989
Tell me about Amanda.
I get the feeling something bad happened.

846
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:25,712
Oh.

847
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:27,193
Amanda.

848
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:33,229
My Amanda, the Amanda that
I fell in love with, is a fictional character.

849
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:36,036
I made her up. She doesn't exist.

850
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:42,918
I didn't realise this until another Amanda
did me in with a collect call from Paris.

851
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:49,070
- Mind if I open another bottle?
- Sure.

852
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:50,553
Fabulous.

853
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:55,914
I'm not sure which one did what
and when she did it,

854
01:10:56,040 --> 01:11:00,192
but I do know I met one of 'em
in Kansas City. I ever tell you that?

855
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:03,676
- No.
- I worked there, right out of college.

856
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:06,516
<i>Kansas City Star.</i>

857
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:10,189
Hemingway worked there.
It was his first job, too.

858
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:14,677
Anyway, I met her in a bar
called the Bum Steer.

859
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:25,149
I couldn't believe my luck. She walks
right up to me, this gorgeous creature.

860
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:30,239
I found out later that she overheard me
tell the bartender I was from New York.

861
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:32,316
I should've known.

862
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:36,194
So, within a week, she moved in with me.

863
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:39,111
My education, she said, excited her,

864
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:44,553
and her desire to educate herself,
with my help, excited me.

865
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:47,513
She wanted to better herself.

866
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:51,952
She had a really terrible childhood.
Really grim.

867
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:56,039
Divorce. Stepfathers - plural.

868
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:00,155
Trailer parks. All that shit.

869
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:07,076
My writing excited her, and the fact
that she was excited, excited me.

870
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:10,237
We got excited a lot together.

871
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:13,830
So eight months later, we moved
to New York. That was inevitable.

872
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:20,115
She wanted to live a magazine ad,
and I wanted to live a literary cliché.

873
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:27,512
My parents weren't exactly thrilled with
us living together, but they liked Amanda.

874
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:32,589
They welcomed her like she was
a fucking refugee, especially my mother.

875
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:37,111
As soon as we got here,
she was desperate to get married.

876
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:39,276
She was worried I was gonna leave her.

877
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:43,598
No, I think she was worried that my book
would be published, I'd become famous,

878
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:48,316
and I'd find somebody else.
Anyway, after a year of living together,

879
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:51,034
and the way she behaved -
"Marry me, marry me, marry me" -

880
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:54,118
we decided it was
the thing to do, so we did it.

881
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:59,312
So there she was -
Mrs Conway on my arm.

882
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:04,673
People were knocked out by her. All my
friends said "God, she could be a model",

883
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:08,475
which was exactly
what she wanted to hear.

884
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:12,479
So one day, she takes it upon herself
to stop off at a modelling agency.

885
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:17,754
Fuck me if she doesn't come home with a
contract, like that. Said she was a natural.

886
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:23,318
So then her career takes off. She's on
magazine covers, commercials, layouts.

887
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:26,000
All her dreams are coming true.

888
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:28,076
Not true of mine.

889
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:33,875
I was trying to write.

890
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,719
I was working on a novel.

891
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:40,515
Submitted some short stories
to the magazine.

892
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:42,596
But our life was complicated then.

893
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:47,669
She was invited everywhere that
I wasn't invited, and I was invited a lot.

894
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:53,716
And getting out of bed at 6am to work
on a novel just kept getting harder...

895
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:56,798
and harder and harder.

896
01:13:56,920 --> 01:14:00,629
And then there was this change,
this really subtle change.

897
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:08,515
I know when I was out she was snooping
around my desk to see if I, the writer...

898
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:10,596
was making any progress.

899
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:16,237
I know this because she started smiling...

900
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:24,433
when I started telling people at cocktail
parties that I was working on a book.

901
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:29,999
Then, about two months ago,

902
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:33,510
she was packing for a trip to Paris,
for the collection.

903
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:36,636
She started to cry.

904
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:42,834
I asked her what was the matter.
She said she was worried about the flight.

905
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:45,758
She was nervous about the flight.

906
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:48,952
By the time the cab came, she was fine.

907
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:51,435
I kissed her at the door.

908
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:56,115
She told me to water the plants.

909
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:03,712
The night before she was due home,
she called.

910
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:06,955
Her voice sounded peculiar.

911
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:10,959
She said she wasn't
coming home this time.

912
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:14,316
I didn't understand.

913
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:17,796
She said her career
was really taking off over there.

914
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:20,958
So...

915
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:25,799
a couple of days later, this man calls.

916
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:29,236
He said he was her lawyer.

917
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:38,077
Easiest thing all the way around,
he said, was for me to sue her...

918
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:43,315
for sexual abandonment.

919
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:49,671
A legal term, he said.

920
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:58,478
My friend Allagash says that
not only was her leaving not surprising,

921
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:00,955
it was inevitable.

922
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:06,399
And my heartbreak is just
a variation on the same old story.

923
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:11,672
- Where's the john?
- Right in there.

924
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:14,598
Are you all right? Are you OK?

925
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:17,075
I'm fine. Yeah, I'm fine.

926
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:30,755
You're too high.

927
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:47,316
"Contraceptive jelly."

928
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:53,360
"Unscented. Colourless. Stainless."

929
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:55,436
This is good news.

930
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:01,355
"Megan Avery. Lithium carbonate.
Take four times daily."

931
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:05,556
Tetracycline.

932
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:09,949
Valium.

933
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:12,036
Victory. Valium.

934
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:15,796
You're too high.

935
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:19,120
You're too high.
You gotta come down.

936
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:21,716
Too high, too high.

937
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:31,916
- You all right?
- Fine.

938
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:36,238
- Just getting the dishes out of the way.
- That's a good policy.

939
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:39,670
- You want some more wine?
- No, I'm not much of a drinker any more.

940
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:42,678
That's also a good policy.

941
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:47,315
Have you been able to write at all?

942
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:54,798
What are you gonna do?
Do you have any job prospects?

943
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:57,070
I've got some leads.

944
01:17:57,200 --> 01:18:00,954
I know an editor at Harper and Row
who'd be happy to talk to you.

945
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:07,918
Megan, I appreciate your efficiency,
but getting fired has wiped my ass out,

946
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:13,319
and I'd just as soon put the prospect of
any future employment on hold right now.

947
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:17,274
But thank you. Thanks very much.

948
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:20,995
If you need a little money to tide you over,
don't hesitate to ask.

949
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:26,274
- You are terrific. You are a rare woman.
- I just wanna see you back on your feet.

950
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:28,755
- Everything's gonna work out.
- A rare woman.

951
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:31,235
Everything's gonna be all right.

952
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:45,749
No. That's not what you want.

953
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:48,440
- Jamie, that's not what you want.
- Yeah.

954
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:49,595
No.

955
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:51,517
Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh.

956
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:53,995
No, no. Calm down. Calm down.

957
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:59,638
Poor baby. Poor baby.

958
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:03,353
- Poor little baby.
- I gotta go.

959
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:07,314
- Oh, fuck, I gotta go.
- Jamie, are you all right?

960
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:11,558
I'm fine. Thanks for
the linguini and sympathy.

961
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:14,638
- Jamie, are you all right?
- I'm OK. I'm OK.

962
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:22,356
Michael.

963
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:25,950
- How'd you get in here?
- I talked to the super. He let me in.

964
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:29,868
- Sneaky little shit.
- What the hell's going on with you, huh?

965
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,753
I've been trying to track you down
for over a week.

966
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:35,030
- When did you get here?
- Today. You saw me!

967
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:38,038
- I thought you were somebody else.
- Bullshit!

968
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:40,993
I left about 150 messages at your office.

969
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:45,398
Then I go to your office and they tell me
that you're no longer employed there.

970
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:48,114
- What's going on?
- What do you wanna see me about?

971
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:51,550
I don't <i>wanna</i> see you. I'd just
as soon leave you to drown in coke,

972
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:53,636
or whatever it is you're doing,

973
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:57,469
but Dad's worried about you,
and I'm worried about Dad.

974
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,875
Why? How is Dad?

975
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,309
Oh, what do you care?

976
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:06,916
Dad's in California on business.
At least, he was until last night.

977
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:09,270
He called me to make sure
you're coming home.

978
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:12,119
Now, since you never
call or answer, here I am.

979
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:14,879
- Now, you're coming back with me.
- OK.

980
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,673
- D'you hear me?
- OK!

981
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:21,236
Tomorrow's the anniversary -
one year - in case you've forgotten.

982
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:26,195
We're gonna spread her ashes in the lake,
and Dad wants you to be there.

983
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:27,673
Jamie?

984
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:33,596
- You've forgotten Mom completely.
- Don't get righteous with me.

985
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:35,676
- You haven't seen Dad since...
- Shut up!

986
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:37,756
- Don't tell me to shut up!
- Shut up!

987
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:40,997
Shut the fuck up, OK?
I'll be there! Shut up!

988
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:43,076
Shut up!

989
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:51,632
Uh...

990
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:53,716
Can I make a sandwich?

991
01:21:56,160 --> 01:21:58,116
Help yourself.

992
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:06,195
Where's Amanda?

993
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:09,915
- Shopping.
- At this time of night?

994
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:25,114
Find everything you need in there?

995
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:28,835
Well, the milk is sour,
this bread is mouldy.

996
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:30,916
What the hell do you live on?

997
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:34,669
- A lot of things that start with D.
- What?

998
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:44,596
Amanda isn't shopping, Mike.
Amanda left me.

999
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:51,516
I'm sorry.

1000
01:22:57,680 --> 01:22:59,636
I never really liked Amanda much.

1001
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:03,309
To tell you the truth,
I always thought she was a fake.

1002
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:10,110
I was just thinking,
when Mom was sick,

1003
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:12,708
Amanda was really cold and distant.

1004
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:18,756
It's like she resented
Mom dying or something.

1005
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:23,032
Well... you think you would have
married her if Mom hadn't been sick?

1006
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:26,197
Mom never said it would
do her heart good to see you get married,

1007
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:31,110
but you wanted her to be happy,
and she wanted you to be happy.

1008
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:35,836
In the end, you might've confused what
she wanted with what Amanda wanted.

1009
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:39,796
You want a couple of lines?

1010
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:44,038
Uh, no, thanks.

1011
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:50,036
- You mind if I take a shower?
- No, would you, Mike? That'd be great.

1012
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:57,829
You know, Jamie, it was exactly
a year ago today that you came home.

1013
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:07,477
I'm gonna hop in the shower.

1014
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:09,556
Good.

1015
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:43,679
- Have you slept with a lot of giris?
-

1016
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:49,232
- Mom, really, that's...
- Oh, come on. What's the matter?

1017
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:54,869
Yeah.

1018
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:59,518
- Yes, Mom, there have been some giris.
- Really?

1019
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:05,513
- Mom, I'm not going into details.
- Why not?

1020
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:09,713
- It's embarrassing.
- Don't be embarrassed.

1021
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:12,991
Just, you know, tell me what it's like.

1022
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:15,475
Do you enjoy it?

1023
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,673
Yeah. Yeah, I like it.

1024
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:24,838
You've slept with giris that
you haven't been in love with?

1025
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:27,599
Is it different when you're in love?

1026
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:29,676
Sure.

1027
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:32,796
It's better.

1028
01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:35,593
Mm-hm.

1029
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:39,998
What about Sally Keegan?
Did you sleep with her?

1030
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:48,189
Once. The night of the prom.

1031
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:50,595
I thought so.

1032
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:54,155
What about Stephanie Bates?

1033
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:57,599
- Oh, God.
- Hm?

1034
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:01,755
How do you know this stuff?

1035
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:23,878
You were the funniest little boy.

1036
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:26,596
You were an awful baby.

1037
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:30,640
You were a real screamer.

1038
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:33,115
You cried through the night.

1039
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:37,109
There were some nights...

1040
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:43,713
we had to take you out, put you in the car,
and drive you around, to get you to sleep.

1041
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:46,195
You were something.

1042
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:50,434
Hold my hand. Hold my hand.

1043
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:51,913
Yes.

1044
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:54,793
Oh!

1045
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:06,472
- The pain...
- Mom, let me give you the morphine, OK?

1046
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:08,556
- No, wait.
- Let me just give you a shot.

1047
01:27:08,680 --> 01:27:13,959
Wait. You know what
this is like, this pain?

1048
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:19,717
This is like when you were born.

1049
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:22,434
It sounds crazy, I know,

1050
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:27,190
but that's exactly what it's like.

1051
01:27:29,080 --> 01:27:31,389
It was that bad?

1052
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:33,476
Terrible.

1053
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:37,031
Oh!

1054
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:39,515
You just didn't wanna come out.

1055
01:27:39,640 --> 01:27:40,993
Oh!

1056
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:45,235
I didn't think I'd live through it.

1057
01:27:48,440 --> 01:27:50,396
Now you know...

1058
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:56,549
why I love you so much.

1059
01:27:56,680 --> 01:27:58,511
So much.

1060
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:18,113
Mom?

1061
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:31,635
The pain's going away.

1062
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:35,915
That's good. That's good.

1063
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:42,514
Are you still holding my hand?

1064
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:48,716
Yes, I am.

1065
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:52,036
Good, honey.

1066
01:28:53,880 --> 01:28:55,836
Don't let go.

1067
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:18,236
- What?
- <i>It's Allagash. I'm at a party.</i>

1068
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:22,956
- <i>Your presence is requested.</i>
- My brother's here, Tad. I can't go.

1069
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:25,196
<i>Amanda's here.</i>

1070
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:27,675
- Where is it?
- <i>Two Staple Street.</i>

1071
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,956
I'll be there.

1072
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:39,315
Michael, I'm going out.

1073
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:42,195
Jamie!

1074
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:51,915
Taxi!

1075
01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:21,593
Barbara?

1076
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:24,751
Where's Allagash?

1077
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:27,838
- I think he's somewhere over there.
- Thanks.

1078
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:35,873
Allagash.

1079
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:41,189
- Where is she?
- Easy, Jamie. You look ready to detonate.

1080
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:46,599
- Whose party is this?
- The heir to some fast-food fortune.

1081
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:50,395
- Jamie, I'd like you to meet Stevie.
- D'you wanna dance?

1082
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:54,035
Maybe later.
Where is she?

1083
01:30:54,160 --> 01:30:56,674
Who? Your formerly deceased,
not yet ex-wife?

1084
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:57,915
Right.

1085
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:01,839
Let me tell you something.
She didn't come alone.

1086
01:31:01,960 --> 01:31:05,509
She's got a new friend.
Some famous French photographer.

1087
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:10,234
She's telling everybody
he's gonna make her a star.

1088
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:27,995
Hi.

1089
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:31,231
Hi.

1090
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:39,758
So... how's it going?

1091
01:31:44,280 --> 01:31:46,236
"How's it going?"

1092
01:31:48,120 --> 01:31:49,235
Yeah.

1093
01:31:50,160 --> 01:31:52,469
"How's it going?"

1094
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:07,116
"How's it going?"

1095
01:32:08,280 --> 01:32:11,397
Oh, fine. How's it going?

1096
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,558
Oh, fuck!

1097
01:32:18,920 --> 01:32:20,876
Come on.

1098
01:32:22,040 --> 01:32:25,635
- Stevie, can you get a glass of water?
- Here, take my drink.

1099
01:32:28,720 --> 01:32:30,676
It's OK. It's OK.

1100
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:38,436
- He got blood on that column.
- Out of the way. He's an epileptic.

1101
01:32:38,640 --> 01:32:40,596
I am not.

1102
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:42,756
He's an emotional quadriplegic.

1103
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:54,276
"How's it going?"

1104
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,956
I need some help.

1105
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:01,756
Whatever that is.

1106
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:09,271
I can't straighten everything out
all in one night.

1107
01:33:52,440 --> 01:33:54,670
- Hello?
- <i>Vicky.</i>

1108
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:58,873
Sorry for calling so late,
or so early, whatever it is. What is it?

1109
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:02,079
- Who is this?
- <i>It's Jamie.</i>

1110
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:05,590
Oh, Jamie.
What time is it?

1111
01:34:05,720 --> 01:34:08,075
It's late. I'm in New York.

1112
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:11,758
- I just wanted to talk.
- <i>You're with Tad?</i>

1113
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:15,873
Yeah, I was with Tad.
Tad's around here someplace.

1114
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:20,949
- <i>Is something wrong?</i>
- I wanted to tell you that my mom died.

1115
01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:25,277
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

1116
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:28,312
- <i>When?</i>
- A year ago.

1117
01:34:28,440 --> 01:34:32,797
I didn't tell you before, so I just wanted
to tell you now. It seemed important.

1118
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:36,277
I'm sorry.

1119
01:34:38,280 --> 01:34:43,593
I tried to block her out of my mind,
but I think I owe it to her to remember.

1120
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:49,591
And I was thinking tonight,
when she found out that she had cancer,

1121
01:34:49,720 --> 01:34:51,676
she was talking to Michael and me.

1122
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:54,155
- <i>Michael?</i>
- My brother.

1123
01:34:55,960 --> 01:34:59,873
She said if the pain became unbearable,
she wanted us to help her...

1124
01:35:00,760 --> 01:35:02,716
you know, end it all.

1125
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:07,799
But she... We had this prescription
for morphine, so there was this option.

1126
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:12,118
So, anyway, the pain got real bad
and I asked her and she said...

1127
01:35:12,240 --> 01:35:15,710
She said that when you're dying,
you have a responsibility to the living.

1128
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:18,798
I was amazed that
she said that, you know?

1129
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:21,955
The way that she felt.

1130
01:35:23,280 --> 01:35:26,875
I was thinking that we have
a responsibility to the dead.

1131
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:30,549
The living, I mean.
God, does any of this make any sense?

1132
01:35:32,680 --> 01:35:36,753
Yeah, maybe.
I can't tell now, Jamie.

1133
01:35:37,880 --> 01:35:42,590
Can I call you back later today
or tomorrow or whatever it is?

1134
01:35:42,720 --> 01:35:47,840
Yeah, call me. Please call me whenever.
Are you sure you're all right?

1135
01:35:47,960 --> 01:35:51,430
My brain's trying to find
a way out of its skull.

1136
01:35:51,560 --> 01:35:54,836
And I'm afraid of just about everything.

1137
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:56,518
But I'm OK.

1138
01:35:57,880 --> 01:36:00,678
- Get some sleep, OK?
- <i>I will.</i>

1139
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:04,190
- Call me if you can't.
- Thanks, Vicky.

1140
01:36:04,720 --> 01:36:06,073
Good night.

1141
01:36:11,560 --> 01:36:12,913
Good night.

1142
01:36:36,680 --> 01:36:38,716
Hey, coach!

1143
01:36:39,320 --> 01:36:43,552
Where are you going? Come on,
Inge just got here. I want you to meet her.

1144
01:36:43,680 --> 01:36:46,148
You can't take off now.
Things are getting good.

1145
01:36:46,280 --> 01:36:49,352
You know, Allagash,
I just realised something.

1146
01:36:49,480 --> 01:36:51,914
- What's that?
- You and Amanda...

1147
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:54,600
would make a terrific couple.

1148
01:37:14,440 --> 01:37:16,396
Hey. Hey!

1149
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:24,876

1158
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:15,117
- Bread.
- What was your first clue?

1159
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:18,998
Can I have some?
Just a roll or something?

1160
01:38:19,120 --> 01:38:21,076
Get outta here.

1161
01:38:24,920 --> 01:38:27,115
I'll trade you my sunglasses.
