00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:56,750
They say my cleaning
is the best they've ever known

4
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:00,630
but cleanliness
of course is an illusion

5
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:04,630
those of us who clean as a profession know
the deeper source of dirt is always there

6
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,390
You can't get rid of it

7
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:11,390
You cannot hide or put a lid on it
as long as human life is there

8
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:15,390
lt's us, the skin we shed
and then the hair...

9
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:31,350
l think of what l do as therapy for homes

10
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:35,510
you know l often see
the pain imprinted on a bed

11
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:42,270
you spot a stain that should not be in there

12
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:46,270
of course you know
at once what's going on

13
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:52,870
But then you go into another room, the one
he keeps his papers in, or so he says...

14
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,670
He sleeps in there
from time to time as well

15
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:17,870
What was l saying? Yes, it all relates

16
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:22,630
The evidence on things like dirty
plates, and socks and underwear

17
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,750
and other things l shouldn't mention

18
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,430
that he sometimes flings into
the toilet and thinks l won't see...

19
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:32,430
Ah, because he flushes, but
unfortunately he doesn't check its gone

20
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:40,190
it's down to me to try again
sometimes l fish it out...

21
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:44,830
lt's quicker in the end, it floats

22
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,870
l doubt they'll ever realize l know it all

23
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:51,670
They think that those of us who clean
are small somehow, in body and in mind

24
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:54,670
we fall our of their line of sight
invisible, we work our magic

25
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:58,670
lndivisible one from the other, we're
a mass, no soul, no rights to speak of

26
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:03,830
just a basic role to play
in keeping their lives looking good

27
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:08,830
Cosmetic artists, that is
what we should be called

28
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:13,150
Or dirt consultants

29
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,830
You waited until l am not there

30
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:23,750
How could you? ln our house?

31
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,310
- Oh don't
- Don't what?

32
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:30,310
- Don't make a scene don't make it worse
- l am not

33
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:35,030
Where, our bed?
The sofa? Or perhaps a chair?

34
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:11,030
That's fine

35
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:30,030
Forgive my question
but are you alright?

36
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,670
- l'm fine, thank you
- Are you sure?

37
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,230
Yes, quite

38
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:37,230
A woman left alone
if it was me... l wouldn't...

39
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,270
Wouldn't what?

40
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:43,270
Let such a beauty out of
my sight, not for a moment, no

41
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:01,870
A woman left alone, l wouldn't...

42
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,910
Wouldn't what?

43
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:07,910
Let such a beauty out of
my sight, not for a moment, no

44
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,470
And let me add

45
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:14,470
l'd like to steal you from the man
who cannot see that you're a queen

46
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:18,670
- When are you free?
- My God, you're fast

47
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:22,670
Oh no, quite slow

48
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:28,030
l don't believe this, l must say no definitely

49
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,950
lt's you

50
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,270
You knew

51
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:40,190
l guessed

52
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,550
That's good, l said l'd call

53
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:46,550
l thought you would

54
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:49,750
- You're over there
- Quite far away

55
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:53,190
You sound so near
and when are you...

56
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:57,190
- Returning? ln a day, or two
- l'd like to meet

57
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:01,750
Yes, where? You say...

58
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:05,750
Let's walk, somewhere, and eat

59
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:11,190
And talk

60
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:14,310
What's that?

61
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:17,350
- My cab, l'm getting out
- l cannot hear...

62
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,750
We'll have to shout

63
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:22,150
- l'll call again...
- Oh, good, yes, do

64
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:26,150
l'm glad l found you...

65
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:34,030
l understand that you've invited me
to make a case that life begins at three hours

66
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:39,470
or at one, or two, or maybe four

67
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:43,470
as if there is a moment when
we can be sure that we are human

68
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:48,030
You'll want evidence, material, not big ideas
nor common sense, but what is measurable

69
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:54,470
What you can see, and not once
but many times, repeatedly

70
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:58,270
For this is science
and that's what we do

71
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:02,270
But wait a minute, is this really true?

72
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:05,630
Could ''objectivity''
be just a point of view?

73
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:09,630
we interpret what we see, and can
see what we expect, in embryology

74
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:15,110
When a man first saw a sperm magnified
he thought he saw a little man inside

75
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,790
and those that looked were
sure that they could see one too

76
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:21,790
so eager were they
to agree, look at this, man?

77
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:26,870
Or mouse? The mystery is that
each cell knows its destiny...

78
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:52,150
Yes

79
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:56,150
Who?

80
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:00,270
Oh, Sister Maud
of course, hello

81
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:04,270
lt's been a while, it has
how time does go...

82
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:08,630
No, she's not here, of course
l'll tell her, yes l'm sure she meant to call

83
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:15,550
Oh, l would guess the weekend
but of course one never knows

84
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:19,310
Yes, always working
that's the way it goes

85
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:23,310
And how is her aunt? Oh
oh dear, how sad, is it serious?

86
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,910
Oh dear... that does sound bad

87
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:34,910
Oh quite, of course
l'll speak to her tonight

88
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:41,990
Except when she
gets back he will be out

89
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:45,990
That's how they organize their lives
l doubt if they will see each other for a week

90
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:51,510
They leave each other
notes but rarely speak

91
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,870
Hello!

92
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,510
- Where are you from?
- l am lrish

93
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,590
- From Belfast
- But you sound...

94
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,430
l know, l know, American

95
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:18,990
They took me there
when l was ten, and you?

96
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:22,990
l am from Beirut

97
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,710
My land is made of stones

98
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:29,710
but we have trees that blossom
in the spring and then release their fruit

99
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:34,430
We have cherries, plums
and peaches and the queen of all

100
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:39,270
the tree that reaches for the sun to fill its
seed with gold, the yellow fruit, the apricot

101
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:47,430
the old and wisest say
this fruit will keep them young

102
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:52,430
And you can taste
her secret with your tongue

103
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:57,070
Potato is our apricot, we bake
we boil, we mash, we fry

104
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:03,470
and then we make a flour of it for dumplings
in our stew or bread or scones or pancakes

105
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:08,710
the famine haunts us still, you see

106
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:13,190
We too are haunted
by our dead, it seems

107
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:16,710
They speak to us
in riddles in our dreams

108
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:20,710
so many killed, they
ask the question, why?

109
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:25,590
Did we have to die?

110
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:31,350
Look, shall we think of something sad?
This conversation's far too light

111
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:35,790
That's bad, yes
absolutely, you are right

112
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:40,750
My auntie in Belfast once
said to me survivors can't forget

113
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:45,830
the memory is all that's left
we cannot let it go

114
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:48,390
lf it is lost, then who will ever know?

115
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:51,950
She brought me up, l loved her so

116
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:55,110
My parents went away when l was two

117
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:57,470
They said they'd fetch me in a month
but then a month became a year...

118
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,870
my father flew back
home from time to time

119
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:03,030
l never knew when l would go
do you believe in God?

120
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:07,030
She didn't, so l had to pray
at school, then go back home

121
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:12,270
and say l thought that reason was the
way the light, and that God was dead

122
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,750
This was a Catholic school
they fed us catechism

123
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:19,230
fear of hell, and fear
of punishment as well

124
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:23,230
They hit us hard to do us good and told us
that we never would survive without our faith

125
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:27,070
My aunt said they were hypocrites

126
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:30,630
you can't imagine how it was
to be alone with such a split

127
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:34,630
but to atone for sinful doubt l searched
for truth, with all the passion of my youth

128
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:40,470
You found it?

129
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:42,230
Science

130
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:46,230
So you think that you can
penetrate the mind of God

131
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:53,270
l do... not know... if God has a mind
or if there is a God, l don't believe...

132
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:55,790
Such golden hair, we can agree...

133
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:59,790
To disagree? How true, l'm talking
far too much, now what of you?

134
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:19,150
We'd rather sing than speak

135
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:24,150
it leaves us free to mourn, or to rejoice

136
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:31,270
Ultimately there always is a choice

137
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:42,190
Ah, so, you see... we're not
so different, really, you and me

138
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:55,230
Speak to me

139
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:59,230
Of what? What is there to say?

140
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:03,710
Too much, or nothing
please try, anyway

141
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:11,110
Well, l adore the number one

142
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:16,950
one you, one me, one moon, one sun

143
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:22,670
Must l revolve around you then? Am l
the silver planet circling round the gold?

144
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:28,750
Are you the source of light and heat, whilst
l am shadow, pulling watery tides, and cold?

145
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:39,350
You hear a meaning where
there's none, l fear... l spoke of one

146
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:44,030
A number, an idea, my preference
for the single state, that's all

147
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:50,430
Single is a word based on illusion
life itself develops from a fusion

148
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:57,390
Two is joining, letting go
attraction and rejection, yes and no

149
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:03,910
lt's not a solo but a sweet duet
that's played to bring us here

150
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:08,550
and the forget how it was
before we met the other

151
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:12,550
lt was two that brought us to the mother
and desire that led us to the lover

152
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:18,990
You're right, but now
l'd like to speak of three

153
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:23,110
Admit, there's you and him
and now there's me

154
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:30,230
Oh God, let's hide inside the number four

155
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:34,830
a house with walls
and with a door that closes on gas

156
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:40,070
we've gone too far, l forgot, the thought
that precedes one, the thought that's not

157
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:47,790
the void, the vast
and endless state of none

158
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:53,710
containing, holding, god-like

159
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:57,550
it's the one and only number
that we really need

160
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:01,550
naught is the majesty that rules
our lives, unseen, and silently

161
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:11,830
Nice, but a bit too mystical for me

162
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:15,670
someone invented zero
so that we could count and measure

163
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:18,310
the unthinkably large unwieldy numbers

164
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:22,310
And it was then, by multiplying to the power
of ten, that we began to measure space

165
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:26,230
and so to time...

166
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,550
- You tricked me!
- No!

167
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:30,470
Yes you did, of course

168
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:34,470
You start with one, then give yourself
the source of all the numbers

169
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:44,590
No, lovely lady, all l meant
to say was this, you are the one

170
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:53,110
The light of day, the velvet night
the single rose, the hand l want to hold

171
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:01,790
the secret country, land of all
my longings, there, you have my word

172
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,990
l used to lay the blondes
who came my way

173
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:56,990
And they were ready for it, night or day
l'd look at them, l wouldn't say a word

174
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:01,430
and they were on their backs
as if they'd heard a heavenly command

175
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:05,430
and then they'd cry, at first
with pleasure, like they'd never had

176
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:07,990
And then they'd phone you up
and drive you mad

177
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:11,990
The weeping and the wailing
and the rest, they'd ruin it

178
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:16,270
At first they were the best, those babes
but now at last l've seen the light

179
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:22,070
Temptation's there
to teach us how to fight

180
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:26,070
the devil comes in every shape and size
those that resist him get the prize

181
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:31,750
The prize is Jesus, thank the Lord above
he is the maximum top source of love

182
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:39,550
Now hold it there, some lasses may be tarts
but they're not evil, they've got broken hearts

183
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:45,070
They do it 'cause it's all they know
they're used for sex when they are kiddies

184
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:48,070
They're abused from start to finish

185
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:52,070
then they're on the streets
and taking drugs instead of eating sweets

186
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:54,430
they haven't got a chance

187
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:58,430
Back home l'd walk around and
chat with them, sometimes, just talk...

188
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:03,030
You'd what? Just talk?
You're not that fucking good

189
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,870
You'd fucking do it if you fucking could

190
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:07,230
You know fuck all about my fucking life

191
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:09,390
l know you're fucking
skint, so did your wife

192
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:11,030
You fucking leave that
out of fucking this

193
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:13,110
l'm only joking, can't l take the piss?

194
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:16,190
The difference is l never had to pay

195
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:20,190
Yes, so you fucking always fucking say
no fucking woman's free of charge

196
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:22,950
No way, you fancy one
but there's no fucking lay

197
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,590
unless you buy the drinks all fucking night

198
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:28,590
lt's not the drinks, you have
to treat them right, they want respect

199
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:31,230
- Respect?
- And dignity

200
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:33,990
Oh, Jesus Christ
l've seen the fucking light

201
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:35,990
You fucking shag them
then chuck them away

202
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:38,950
and now you've got the fucking cheek
to say that you respect them

203
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,830
and they're fucking white
and fucking blonde

204
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:44,830
Oh, come on now, big boy
you'll pull a girlie soon, don't start a fight

205
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:48,150
l saw a woman once, upon a bus

206
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:51,510
She was a foreigner, not one of us

207
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:55,510
she sat alone, this tourist from the west
her trembling bosom in a skin-tight vest

208
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:01,990
The men were staring at her from behind
the same scenario in every mind

209
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:04,950
- There was a television...
- On the bus?

210
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,310
With fucking videos and all, like us?

211
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:09,030
Don't interrupt
what happened next? Poor lass...

212
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,750
Each fucking Arab got a piece of ass

213
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,590
An image came up on the shaking screen

214
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,790
A porno movie!
Fucking gang-bang scene!

215
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,110
Shut up!

216
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:20,110
He's right, the image was obscene
but not the way you think

217
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:25,390
lt was a girl, a young one, fair and fresh

218
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:29,630
a lovely pearl with long fair hair that blew
around her head like golden candy floss

219
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:34,910
as she shot dead one man
after another with her gun

220
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:39,150
We stared, and sweated, as the blazing sun
beat down upon the bus, but didn't care...

221
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:43,070
She wore a costume
that was hardly there

222
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:46,830
a little piece of fabric round her hips
and covering her breasts

223
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:50,830
and on her lips some glossy red

224
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:55,230
and every time she killed
a man, her lips would open

225
00:22:56,670 --> 00:23:00,670
Yes, she spilled their blood
with pleasure, and she wore a flag

226
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:07,150
the cloth that covered her
was not a rag, it was a symbol

227
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:11,150
Stars and stripes, l swear
this was a blonde American

228
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:20,230
they share their women's bodies
with the world, you see

229
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:24,070
lt's true, they have no shame or modesty

230
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:27,750
Come on now, lads
it's not all black and white

231
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:30,310
They may be wrong
but you're not in the right

232
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:33,430
Where he comes from
the lasses wear the veil

233
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:35,550
They've got no life
it's like they're in a jain

234
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:38,390
Too fucking right!
Some wear those things like beaks

235
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:40,590
They look like fucking crows
give me the creeps

236
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:42,670
Aye... they're oppressed

237
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:44,070
But what about the vest?

238
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:46,150
That one up front
all trembling and the rest?

239
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:50,150
She was a foreigner, therefore a guest
and we were hosts, therefore we were polite

240
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:56,910
That's all that happened?
What a load of shite

241
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:10,430
Hi gorgeous

242
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:20,510
l am feeling fat, what do you think?

243
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:24,190
Oh darling girl, you're
lovely and you're more...

244
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:26,870
You will have a stream
of lovers who will adore you

245
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:30,830
Not just for your eyes and
glossy hair and for you slender body

246
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:34,150
Don't despair, you are
not fat, but even if you were

247
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:35,950
You'd still be beautiful

248
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:39,030
You see! You think l'm huge! l knew it!

249
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:42,870
l did not interfere that you
were over-large in any way

250
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:45,310
What your god-mother
is trying to say is this

251
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:48,190
Grace, there is so much more
to you than your reflection

252
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:52,190
So much, more to do than
stand and stare, obsessed with...

253
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:57,230
You are not fat! Don't waste
another breath of yours on that!

254
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:02,870
But don't you worry about
you? The lines and stuff?

255
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:06,350
Pursuit of beauty is the rule

256
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:08,790
They say you mustn't
let it go without a struggle

257
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:12,790
l will be there with color covering every
hair that's grey and cutting straight away

258
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:17,510
lf there's a wrinkle, wait and see
l'll do it when l'm twenty-three

259
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:39,710
- How's school?
- Okay

260
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:43,710
- What interests you most?
- You mean: What's fun?

261
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:48,670
l know you like to boast that
you are a party girl without a brain

262
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:54,310
l don't believe you grace, now try again

263
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:58,070
lf you insist

264
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:02,070
l suppose there's something
l quite like to think about

265
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:07,870
l find l lie in bed and then
l start to drift and dream

266
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:16,710
Things are not really as they seem

267
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:22,270
That's true enough, look closer and
we see that everything is really chemistry

268
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:28,990
The world is made of sulfur and of tin
of phosphorous and lead and nitrogen

269
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:35,150
Of mercury, zinc and hydrogen

270
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:38,190
Of gold and silver and uranium

271
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:42,190
Of carbon and iron and palladium

272
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:46,270
Of carbon, potassium, titanium

273
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:53,310
So Grace, what do
you really want to be?

274
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:57,310
Famous

275
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:10,270
l was a doctor with a knife
l cut the flesh to save the life

276
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:16,710
A surgeon, yes, my father too
but l came here what could l do?

277
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:24,630
l use my knife to cut the food, l do it
well, l'm very good at cutting meat

278
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:30,550
l chop, l dice the ham which l don't eat

279
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:34,910
l slice it wafer-thin
so delicate, like lady's lace

280
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:40,750
lt's very nice to look at
silky to the touch

281
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:47,590
l like my work, yes very much

282
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:53,230
But surely, don't you feel
you're wasting what you were?

283
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:57,110
The task you trained for?

284
00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:00,470
Why did you choose to leave a country
that could use your talents properly?

285
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:04,470
No reason, why should l jump in plane
and grieving, fly half way around the world?

286
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:12,270
Perhaps yes! l forgot! l was a surgeon

287
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:19,190
now the plot has changed
the story been revised...

288
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:24,230
The hero's been reduced, down-sized
a lower kind of man, a cook!

289
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:31,270
The kind of man you would not
look at, is that what you want to say?

290
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:36,590
Not good enough for you today?

291
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:44,550
One night l saved
a man from certain death

292
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:49,150
l operate when he took a breath

293
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:51,270
l knew that he was safe and l felt good

294
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:55,270
l had done my job with
skill the way l should

295
00:28:56,350 --> 00:29:00,350
l turned to go, but standing in the
door, were three men that l knew

296
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:04,230
but l was sure, they
had not come to talk

297
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:05,790
For it was late

298
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:09,790
They carried guns
and in their eyes was hate

299
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:14,750
they told me l was wasting
precious skill and time on someone

300
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:19,070
that might later
kill a child of theirs, or mine

301
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:28,750
Before my eyes they shot him dead

302
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:35,270
They said: you can't disguise
one of ''them'' as a patient

303
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:39,270
from now on you treat our
people only, do you hear?

304
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:45,190
l packed my bags
at once, and l was gone

305
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:52,230
They'd killed a man and murdered an idea
that doctors answer to a human need

306
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:55,870
without a thought of color, or of creed

307
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:59,870
and then had the effrontery to claim
that they had done it in my people's name

308
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:06,990
- lt's something that you wouldn't understand
- Oh but l do, you're not the only ones

309
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:14,910
l feel your story in my blood and bones

310
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:18,910
l see a father, calling to his son, l see
the houses crumble, dust and stones

311
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:23,190
l hear the gunfire, and the
knock at night upon the door

312
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:26,910
l see the women's fright, l hear
the adolescent called to fight

313
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:30,910
l see him march away in morning light and
not look back, he knows his mother weeps

314
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:34,750
She fears that she will lose
another son, she's buried two already

315
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:38,590
Listen to her litany as the
tears glisten on her cheeks

316
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:41,390
And to the bell that's
ringing calling her to church

317
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:44,310
to join the singing
and to praise the Lord

318
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:48,310
Yes l know of so called holy war

319
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:53,190
you do not have to go
so very far from here to find it

320
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:26,310
- You're looking good
- Well, thank you Kate... am l?

321
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:28,430
l think l see a sparkle in your eye

322
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:31,110
But as for me... l'm
tired, my limbs are sore

323
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:34,070
My feet are aching, oh
l'm such a bore l'm sorry

324
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:36,870
l've just been at home and you have
gone half-way around the world

325
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:40,390
How you can climb out of your bed at dawn
when you've had 3 or 4 hours sleep at most

326
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:42,790
But then you see, that's the
difference between you and me

327
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:46,190
- l simply do not have your energy
- What nonsense, you're amazing

328
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:49,950
- You have far more stamina than me
- What was the conference about?

329
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,950
They want an easy ethical way out

330
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:54,790
so that the public doesn't have
to feel we're killing living things

331
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:56,270
- But are you?
- Kate!

332
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:59,150
l'm sorry, but you know l really
hate to think of those poor little...

333
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:03,070
- They're y cells that's all they are
- Sorry!

334
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:07,070
- Do they feel pain?
- Why must l justify my work again?

335
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:21,830
- How are the children?
- Fine

336
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:25,830
The little ones as usual are divine
but of course the giantess is trouble

337
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:30,670
She stays upstairs in the heap of rubble
she calls her room and never talks to me

338
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:33,670
l hear you took her out
the other day, how was it?

339
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:35,790
Lovely, for me, anyway

340
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:39,790
Oh yes? But then...
she so looks up to you...

341
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:43,790
She thinks l'm dull, sometimes
l wish that l could get away like you

342
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:47,950
just take off on some sunny day

343
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:50,990
one airport's like another

344
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:54,990
l used to dream to travel... now l pack and
unpack suits and shoes, that's all they see

345
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:59,870
The haircut and the
clothes, even with me

346
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:02,350
- l envy you...
- Envy... oh? Why?

347
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:04,630
Because you're free to wear
your ancient tracksuits all the time

348
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:06,630
and t-shirts covered
in your baby's slime

349
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:10,630
Well thanks, that lovely portrait really
gives a feeling for the life a mother lives

350
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:13,710
A less important job, the one job l do

351
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:17,710
Thank God our mothers did it, though
you would not be here at all, nor would l

352
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:24,950
Why is it that we always end this way?
Competing for who suffers most?

353
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:31,870
Perhaps you did it right: a single mum
so-called 'open marriage' has become...

354
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,710
We just can't talk... so many lies...

355
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:42,710
Well, l guess that that's
what happens when love dies

356
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:46,990
Kate, you know us both, you're his friend
too, l am really longing to say too much

357
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:50,990
- What has he said to you?
- Oh, nothing, really

358
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:21,310
Oh lovely goddess, whore
and tramp you are my love

359
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:25,750
You light the lamp that guides me
through the velvet night towards you

360
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,630
Hold me, hold me tight

361
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:31,630
Your voice, your paleness, your
perfume, your presence haunts me

362
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:36,630
ln my room l wait
for you, filled with desire

363
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:39,070
Your hungry look ignites my fire

364
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:43,070
Oh lady, what then can l do
but burn? l am in flames for you

365
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:48,510
Before l knew you
now l know l was not living

366
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:52,510
This is so much more
than anything l've felt

367
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:56,630
My love: you hold me and l melt

368
00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:01,550
l am not solid anymore
l am a feeling

369
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:07,230
Call me whore, l'll ask for more!

370
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:11,230
The names you give me
names l never would forgive

371
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:15,990
lf spoken to me in the street... somehow
from you, my love... they're sweet

372
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:33,870
What can l give you, lady luck?
What other words and names?

373
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:37,350
l'll fuck you as a mistress, as a queen

374
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:41,350
l'll worship you with words obscene and
ugly, all the more to show how l adore you

375
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:49,510
Bring you low with
language from the gutter

376
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:53,510
Hear me now, l'll gently
mutter things into your ear

377
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:57,830
flowing streams of words from fantasies
and dreams you've not confessed to anyone

378
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:01,870
Yes please! Yes, say it all!

379
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:05,870
Let forbidden thoughts be heard
let the hidden parts be seen

380
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:11,950
The only danger is that all the lonely private
places you have been to might dissolve

381
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:18,430
And you will be seen to blossom

382
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:24,030
singing, dancing, humming

383
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:33,030
Laughing... come here love

384
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:39,590
You're coming

385
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:25,630
Grace come in

386
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:29,310
ls she here?

387
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:33,310
Not now but come on in
and wait, Grace, anyhow

388
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:09,070
Do make yourself
at home, come sit by me

389
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:18,190
Something to drink?
Perhaps you'd like some tea?

390
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:22,470
No thanks

391
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:32,230
- How's school?
- Fine

392
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:41,750
Not too much to say

393
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:45,750
l see, well, Grace, you don't give
much away you're very wise!

394
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:51,790
l do my best

395
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:55,870
But you don't have to do
a thing you just have to be

396
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:02,150
The rest comes later
when you're old, like me

397
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:06,990
l'm not that young
and you are not that old

398
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:12,630
You're sweet

399
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:19,350
Grace... may l confide in you?

400
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:26,830
Your godmother and l...

401
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:32,070
she thinks l'm... cold

402
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:36,150
but it's her... you see

403
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:40,150
l have feelings too

404
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:13,110
- He said you're cold
- Who?

405
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:15,150
Your husband

406
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:19,150
- Oh God, and what the hell was he...
- l came to see you, you were out

407
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:22,110
And then he told me all
about his secret feelings

408
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:23,870
Oh, l see

409
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:27,870
That must have been... exactly when?

410
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:31,830
He held my hand as well

411
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:35,830
Oh Jesus Christ, and then?

412
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:40,590
l need to talk at the end of my day

413
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:44,870
She feels l've compromised
or lost my way, so she won't listen

414
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:51,990
She will never learn what changing
things, in practice, has to be

415
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:56,910
She's like a student, her mentality
is as it was when we first met

416
00:41:57,710 --> 00:42:01,710
all dreams, and talk and grand ideas
and lofty schemes about society and truth

417
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:10,150
l tried to do something to right the
wrongs l somehow, am now the enemy

418
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:16,430
Whilst she does science and
retains integrity or so she thinks

419
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:21,550
She always has to feel
that she's the underdog

420
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:25,150
the one who's real
while l am false, somehow

421
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:29,150
And l am English too of course, while
she is lrish through and through

422
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:33,230
The fact is that she left
when she was ten!

423
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:37,230
She grew up in America, but then
it suits her to forget that on the whole

424
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:43,990
She claims her roots and so can
play the role of the oppressed

425
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:47,990
Right, so tell me why she never
seems to find the time to fly back home

426
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:51,710
to see one of the very
last true communists

427
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:55,710
Her auntie in Belfast?

428
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:01,990
To say those things to her
he has abused us both

429
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:04,790
She doesn't need to know how
we have organized our marriage

430
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:07,870
And then he said things about...

431
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:10,350
She so looks up to me!
l could kill him l could hoot him dead

432
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:11,870
our god-daughter!
l can't believe he said...

433
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:14,190
Have you ever seen
a body full of bullets?

434
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:17,150
- As a matter of fact...
- You people...?

435
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:20,230
- Who?
- Are so naive

436
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:21,350
What?

437
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:25,350
The stupid things that you believe, you think
there is no pain that cannot be forgotten

438
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:28,950
And no chain that fetters
you that cannot be undone

439
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:32,950
You're ''free'', but must defend that
with a gun, a tank, a helicopter or a bomb

440
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:37,710
So no-one thinks that
way where you come from?

441
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:40,790
Why suddenly accuse me in this way?

442
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:44,790
l have a different point
of view on life and death

443
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:49,510
But is that true?

444
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:53,510
You are a scientist and from the west
you think you know it all, that you're the best

445
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:59,750
One life of yours worth
more than all the rest

446
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:03,750
Hello? ls it me that you are talking to?
What do you know about my point of view?

447
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:07,310
And, come to that, about the work l do?

448
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:11,310
You do not seem to work much, anyway...
l work at night, but you... here in the day...

449
00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:17,510
Jesus! What's going on?
What did l say?

450
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:21,510
- lt seems that you know nothing of my life
- l know that you are married, you're a wife

451
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:27,950
A woman with a lover, in the day
perhaps another one at night? Or two?

452
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:34,990
l don't have lovers
there is only you

453
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:44,470
Oh shit, man, l was saved
from as worse than sin

454
00:44:44,830 --> 00:44:47,870
My life as ugly, l ate out of bins

455
00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:50,950
You know l sank that low, l had no pride

456
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:54,950
The dirt on me... and in my
mouth... l lied with every breath

457
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:59,070
l didn't have a friend left in the world...
they gave up in the end lt was hopeless

458
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:01,870
And it was all because
l turned away from Jesus

459
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:05,870
lt was hell, but then he found me
and he made me well again

460
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:09,870
Oh praise the Lord, the mighty one
who gave this undeserving world his son

461
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:12,870
You think it's you that
fucking turned away?

462
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:15,350
He saw your fucking face
and thought: no way!

463
00:45:15,350 --> 00:45:16,710
Don't mock the man

464
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:20,710
But look, l can't believe any father that
would go and leave his son in such a mess

465
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:22,830
Why didn't he come sooner?

466
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:26,670
- None of it makes sense to me
- Too right it don't, you've got to fucking think

467
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:30,630
l'm God, you're dirt, l wash you
in the sink of holy fucking water

468
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:31,950
Well, what for?

469
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:35,390
For one less sinner banging at the door
of heaven when it's all too fucking late?

470
00:45:35,390 --> 00:45:38,350
- The Lord is merciful
- l fucking hate this crap

471
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:42,070
There ain't no God, it's fucking shite
and if there is, he's full of fucking spite

472
00:45:42,070 --> 00:45:44,030
- lt's you that's negative
- Don't pick on me!

473
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:47,190
- l'm not, but every cunt's your enemy
- Too fucking right!

474
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:50,790
lf Jesus chose that fuck instead
of me, now who's got all the luck?

475
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:54,790
His heart is big enough for you as well
if you repent your sins you're saved from hell

476
00:45:55,230 --> 00:45:57,190
He will forgive the things
you've said today

477
00:45:57,190 --> 00:45:59,830
Just go down on your
knees and start to pray

478
00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:01,430
Fuck off! You fucking wanker!

479
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:03,710
There's no way! That wasn't
what l fucking meant to say

480
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:06,270
- What did you mean?
- You picking on me too?

481
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:08,350
- l only asked
- What do you fucking do?

482
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:11,470
Go down the fucking mosque?
Dark fucking horse

483
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:13,470
lnfidel!

484
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:17,350
Oh, oh what? Of fucking course!
You're a fanatic, one of them

485
00:46:17,350 --> 00:46:18,790
Be careful, lady

486
00:46:18,790 --> 00:46:21,230
- Why, are you afraid?
- Don't be ridiculous

487
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:23,550
- The lamb has strayed
- What fucking lamb?

488
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:25,310
The lamb of God's in hell

489
00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:28,910
- He was in Paradise, and now he fell
- l've had it with this fucking God and shit

490
00:46:28,910 --> 00:46:30,950
There ain't no paradise
this fucking crap is it

491
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:33,430
This country's full
of wankers dressed in sheets

492
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:35,350
asylum fucking seekers in our streets

493
00:46:35,350 --> 00:46:37,710
And taking all our
fucking jobs, Arab wanks!

494
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:39,030
- Easy, easy
- No then what do they do?

495
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:41,030
To give us thanks what the
do they fucking blow us up!

496
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:43,590
- You've got it wrong
- That fucking jihad war, it won't be long

497
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:45,990
The war is fought inside the soul of man

498
00:46:45,990 --> 00:46:49,390
He struggles, doing everything
he can to overcome his base desires

499
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:52,070
The part of him that's
animal and has no heart

500
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:55,550
The self that's primitive and has
no mind, that's why there is a law

501
00:46:55,550 --> 00:46:58,030
lslamic law's not kind but it is fair

502
00:46:58,030 --> 00:47:01,430
A bomb's not fucking fair, you
Arab shites are evil, you don't care

503
00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:04,110
To you we're all the same
from over there, you're ignorant

504
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:07,190
- Now don't you fucking dare
- You celebrate your ignorance with joy

505
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:10,950
You should be studying, you're
just a boy and living on the street

506
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:14,350
So fucking what? You fucking
foreigners have stole the lot

507
00:47:14,350 --> 00:47:18,350
There ain't no fucking houses left for us
you dirty mother-fucking load of pus

508
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:22,470
- Come off it, son, he didn't mean
- Boy, answer me, are your hands clean?

509
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:25,750
l'm not an Arab if that's what you mean

510
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:29,190
- Then you may touch...
- This fuck's too fucking much!

511
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:32,990
lnsult my people, you're insulting me

512
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:34,270
l may have my doubts

513
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:38,270
but now when l see an animal like you
l'd rather be of any faith than be of none

514
00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:44,110
Go on then lady, give it to him, son

515
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:51,550
ls that what you need there?

516
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:05,510
Out

517
00:49:40,470 --> 00:49:44,470
- l need to see you
- Look l can't, not now

518
00:49:46,110 --> 00:49:48,510
- Then later?
- No

519
00:49:48,510 --> 00:49:51,750
- Tomorrow, anyhow?
- l cannot say

520
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:55,470
- You cannot say, why not?
- Some problems

521
00:49:55,470 --> 00:49:59,470
Well, me too... have you forgot?

522
00:50:03,830 --> 00:50:07,830
Look, it's... we need to talk, let's go away

523
00:50:10,470 --> 00:50:14,470
A small hotel a night or two l will pay

524
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:40,030
Sorry

525
00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:58,190
- How are you?
- Fine

526
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:05,070
That's it?

527
00:52:05,070 --> 00:52:07,550
Don't nag

528
00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:11,310
l'm sorry, l don't follow
you, could you repeat?

529
00:52:11,310 --> 00:52:13,630
Or is it that l ought to learn
somehow to read your mind?

530
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:17,630
l am sure that if l try l'll find a way...

531
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:22,830
l'm going out

532
00:52:28,350 --> 00:52:30,590
Sometimes you are a bitch

533
00:52:30,590 --> 00:52:34,590
The bitch and nag: a lovely pair
yes, do go out and get some air

534
00:52:38,430 --> 00:52:42,430
Why won't you fight? Why won't you
shout? Then we could argue our way out

535
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:47,710
Look, as it happens
l am proud of my control

536
00:52:48,230 --> 00:52:51,270
You say out loud the
first thing that occurs to you

537
00:52:51,270 --> 00:52:55,270
l don't behave like you
and l am glad of that

538
00:52:56,710 --> 00:52:59,510
l try to do my best for us, don't sigh...

539
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:01,710
Am l too much? Am l too much real?

540
00:53:01,710 --> 00:53:04,830
Perhaps with me you have to feel

541
00:53:04,830 --> 00:53:08,830
Feel what? The loss of all
our dreams? The end of us?

542
00:53:15,590 --> 00:53:18,630
Some empty schemes to fill the void?

543
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:22,630
Re-decorate the house perhaps, or
celebrate my birthday or some other date...

544
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:26,830
Our anniversary! Let's wake up
somewhere else, let's take a break

545
00:53:27,110 --> 00:53:31,110
Lie on a beach and feel
the ache of emptiness

546
00:53:32,590 --> 00:53:36,590
You're bored, you read a book

547
00:53:36,990 --> 00:53:40,990
And then we go and feed ourselves...
at some expensive place you hate

548
00:53:41,950 --> 00:53:45,950
And so you pull a face
at me as if the fault were mine

549
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:51,310
You think it's good to feel l've failed?

550
00:53:51,590 --> 00:53:53,990
You think it's good to feel

551
00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:57,990
l've jailed you somehow in a boring, cold
hell of a place where we grow old together

552
00:53:58,510 --> 00:54:02,510
wishing that we weren't?

553
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:08,750
l've learned that not to feel at all is best

554
00:54:09,190 --> 00:54:12,790
There was a time when love was
there, there must have been

555
00:54:12,790 --> 00:54:16,150
yes it was you who once said
conversation was an aphrodisiac...

556
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:17,470
because it flowed

557
00:54:17,470 --> 00:54:20,510
Like nectar, or like juice

558
00:54:20,510 --> 00:54:24,510
Oh, fuck it, fuck it, what's the use

559
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:34,390
- How is your Aunt?
- l don't know

560
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:38,310
- You didn't call?
- Not yet

561
00:54:38,310 --> 00:54:41,390
- You are so...
- So what?

562
00:54:41,390 --> 00:54:43,630
Neglectful, don't you care?

563
00:54:43,630 --> 00:54:47,630
Of course l do! Oh don't you dare
accuse me, fuck of course l care

564
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:53,150
l care too much, l love my aunt, l'll call right
now, oh fuck, it's far too late, but, anyhow...

565
00:54:57,110 --> 00:55:01,110
How could you say
those things to Grace?

566
00:56:31,790 --> 00:56:35,790
- What's going on?
- l can't go on like this

567
00:56:36,830 --> 00:56:40,830
Like what? What did
l say? What did l miss?

568
00:56:42,070 --> 00:56:46,070
l need you, l need
your body, need it so...

569
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:49,790
What's wrong?
And don't ring off again, don't go

570
00:56:49,790 --> 00:56:53,790
- This is impossible
- What is? Tell me!

571
00:56:55,270 --> 00:56:59,270
Look in your heart and you will surely
see that l have... acted... with sincerity

572
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:13,030
But now the time has
come to say... good-bye

573
00:57:13,390 --> 00:57:17,390
What? To say what?

574
00:57:18,190 --> 00:57:22,190
You can't... but... why?

575
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:38,150
My body's been in your possession now

576
00:57:38,550 --> 00:57:42,550
l'm asking for it back, it once was mine

577
00:57:44,110 --> 00:57:48,110
But, everything l said was true

578
00:57:49,510 --> 00:57:53,510
However shipped you
yes, you have been... divine

579
00:58:08,550 --> 00:58:12,550
l'm hearing something strange
behind your honeyed words

580
00:58:13,950 --> 00:58:17,950
l feel a doubt so strong
it's poisoning my mind...

581
00:58:20,070 --> 00:58:23,470
This bitter question must come out

582
00:58:23,470 --> 00:58:27,470
Asking's way beneath me, brother, for
you said there was no other one for you

583
00:58:28,790 --> 00:58:32,790
l was your secret country

584
00:58:33,630 --> 00:58:37,510
And the land of all my longings

585
00:58:37,510 --> 00:58:41,510
So... who is she?

586
00:58:42,710 --> 00:58:46,710
No female body tempts me
please believe me when l say that

587
00:58:49,390 --> 00:58:53,390
l'd never leave you for another woman

588
00:58:54,510 --> 00:58:58,510
Who could be the scarlet
goddess you have been for me?

589
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:10,950
Ah but l never asked for this
but l never asked for this

590
00:59:10,950 --> 00:59:13,790
To be blinded groping for a kiss
to be blinded groping for a kiss

591
00:59:13,790 --> 00:59:17,790
l am on fire

592
00:59:18,030 --> 00:59:20,150
l want to hit and attack

593
00:59:20,150 --> 00:59:23,630
l want to stab you in the back and
make you feel the power of vengeance

594
00:59:23,630 --> 00:59:26,310
Sweet-talking man with your...
your... hypocrite romance

595
00:59:26,310 --> 00:59:30,310
A hypocrite? l am not the lying kind

596
00:59:31,310 --> 00:59:35,310
What can l do to purify your mind?
l need to wash you, yes, from head to toe

597
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:42,350
- What did you say?
- How can you doubt me so?

598
00:59:42,350 --> 00:59:46,350
Wash me? Do you see some dirt?
Can you not see how your words hurt?

599
00:59:47,830 --> 00:59:50,910
- Divinity...
- Don't call me that, it isn't me

600
00:59:50,910 --> 00:59:54,470
Through long afternoons
l've felt your lovely arms about me

601
00:59:54,470 --> 00:59:58,470
Tasted you and known the charms
of flesh on flesh, of skin of lovely skin

602
00:59:59,670 --> 01:00:02,990
But when your blood is calling
it's a sin to turn away from them

603
01:00:02,990 --> 01:00:06,990
Now wait, blood?
Sin? What's happening?

604
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:12,430
l have remembered who l am

605
01:00:12,430 --> 01:00:16,430
The old and wisest men explain that
all the love a woman gives distracts us

606
01:00:18,110 --> 01:00:22,110
We are told that riches wait for those who
rise above temptation to obey a higher call

607
01:00:23,350 --> 01:00:26,590
you're asking me
to turn away to fall from grace

608
01:00:26,590 --> 01:00:30,590
You cannot look me in the face
and say that l fall from grace

609
01:00:34,670 --> 01:00:38,670
Do you really think l am unclean?
A second-hand cunt, a fucking machine?

610
01:00:41,310 --> 01:00:45,310
A dirty distraction
somehow obscene?

611
01:00:48,030 --> 01:00:49,910
l am not only your goddess or queen

612
01:00:49,910 --> 01:00:53,910
l'm a twenty-first century any damn thing
that l choose, including your teacher or king!

613
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:56,750
l named you goddess
and queen, l crowned you

614
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:59,990
Fuck you!

615
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:03,990
- Who do you think you are?
- l draw a line: you're not a king!

616
01:01:04,190 --> 01:01:06,190
That role is mine!

617
01:01:06,190 --> 01:01:10,190
Oh sir, excuse me, l forgot
you are a son and l am not

618
01:01:12,030 --> 01:01:14,990
l am a daughter so inferior

619
01:01:14,990 --> 01:01:18,990
lt's you, your people feel superior
you want to rule you want to spoil

620
01:01:23,110 --> 01:01:26,790
You want our land, you want our oil

621
01:01:26,790 --> 01:01:29,590
You call that civilize?

622
01:01:29,590 --> 01:01:33,590
Your country is a dragon breathing flames
land of corporate fantasies, brand names

623
01:01:34,950 --> 01:01:38,150
Big Mac, Big burger, yes big everything

624
01:01:38,150 --> 01:01:42,150
And you blonde American are
too thin, too fit, not womanly

625
01:01:45,470 --> 01:01:49,150
And then: your skin too pale, insipid

626
01:01:49,150 --> 01:01:53,150
And your eyes, too blue, why
do you make me dream of you?

627
01:01:59,190 --> 01:02:03,190
So we are at war

628
01:02:06,990 --> 01:02:09,590
- You terrorist
- lmperialist

629
01:02:09,590 --> 01:02:11,550
- Bigot!
- Bitch!

630
01:02:11,550 --> 01:02:15,550
How did it come to this?

631
01:02:17,190 --> 01:02:20,510
You are confusing me with them

632
01:02:20,510 --> 01:02:24,150
Look, l am not just an
American, l am lrish too

633
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:27,790
So what? You all have
roots somewhere

634
01:02:27,790 --> 01:02:31,790
But have forgot that you
are anything but powerful

635
01:02:32,710 --> 01:02:36,270
The big Boss

636
01:02:36,270 --> 01:02:40,270
You hear our children screams but
feel no lust because they are not yours

637
01:02:41,230 --> 01:02:42,950
That is not fair

638
01:02:42,950 --> 01:02:45,950
The things that they have
done have not been in my name

639
01:02:45,950 --> 01:02:49,950
l do not feel pride
l feel a deepening shame

640
01:02:51,910 --> 01:02:55,910
Look, l am an individual, l am me

641
01:02:58,030 --> 01:03:01,270
Me this, me that

642
01:03:01,270 --> 01:03:05,270
- Each one of that is we, we are not alone
- l know, look l agree, l am not your enemy?

643
01:03:09,070 --> 01:03:11,190
How did this start?

644
01:03:11,190 --> 01:03:15,190
From Elvis to Eminem
Warhol's art, l know your stories

645
01:03:18,830 --> 01:03:22,830
Know your songs by heart
but do you know mine? No

646
01:03:23,230 --> 01:03:27,230
Every time, l make the effort
and l learn to rhyme in your English

647
01:03:30,150 --> 01:03:34,150
And do you know a word
of my language, even one?

648
01:03:35,190 --> 01:03:39,150
Have you heard that 'al-gebra'
was an Arabic man?

649
01:03:39,150 --> 01:03:43,150
You have read the Bible
have you read the Koran?

650
01:03:47,110 --> 01:03:51,110
ls this the reason you're rejecting me?

651
01:03:51,150 --> 01:03:55,150
Rejection? No, l don't reject
but, yes, l do demand respect

652
01:03:57,950 --> 01:04:01,950
You say you want me, but as what?
Your exotic, something other?

653
01:04:04,470 --> 01:04:08,470
Your, toy-boy, pet, your secret lover?

654
01:04:11,190 --> 01:04:14,990
You buy me with
a credit card in restaurants

655
01:04:14,990 --> 01:04:18,150
You want me hard so you can melt

656
01:04:18,150 --> 01:04:19,870
Why can't you see that being wanted

657
01:04:19,870 --> 01:04:23,870
not for me, nor for my noble
ancestry, but for my flesh

658
01:04:24,350 --> 01:04:27,270
Erodes my dignity

659
01:04:27,270 --> 01:04:31,230
Your pride is hurt, you
feeling small and wounded

660
01:04:31,230 --> 01:04:35,230
But can l walk tall when people spit
into my face because they fear me?

661
01:04:36,270 --> 01:04:38,630
Where's my place of pride
and honor in this game

662
01:04:38,630 --> 01:04:42,630
where even to pronounce
my name is an impossibility?

663
01:04:48,110 --> 01:04:52,110
l hear you, tell me more

664
01:05:06,190 --> 01:05:10,190
ln your land l am not seen

665
01:05:13,670 --> 01:05:17,670
l am un-manned

666
01:05:19,070 --> 01:05:23,070
You can't imagine with the
white-skinned sense of privilege

667
01:05:24,070 --> 01:05:28,070
and human rights you take for granted

668
01:05:29,390 --> 01:05:33,390
How l fight for every little thing

669
01:05:50,430 --> 01:05:54,430
Oh no

670
01:05:54,950 --> 01:05:58,950
Oh no, oh no

671
01:06:00,110 --> 01:06:02,830
Bye, l have to go

672
01:06:02,830 --> 01:06:06,830
l didn't call, l didn't call

673
01:06:09,990 --> 01:06:13,990
l didn't call

674
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:11,590
You're late again
don't worry, never mind

675
01:07:11,630 --> 01:07:15,270
l know you're busy
it's the kind of life you lead

676
01:07:15,270 --> 01:07:17,870
But then, you chose it
so l guess you want it

677
01:07:17,870 --> 01:07:21,870
Always to and fro, you
never stop, unlike myself

678
01:07:22,350 --> 01:07:26,190
l'm here to stay, for just
how long, who knows

679
01:07:26,190 --> 01:07:30,190
l fear it could be ages, it creeps
up on you this funny business

680
01:07:31,390 --> 01:07:35,390
First a creak or two, your knees perhaps
and, bingo! Then you're old and in a bed

681
01:07:38,110 --> 01:07:41,670
The thing is, no-one told
me l'd have all this time

682
01:07:41,670 --> 01:07:45,510
but far too late to use it
for the things l dreamed of

683
01:07:45,510 --> 01:07:47,870
Oh auntie

684
01:07:47,870 --> 01:07:51,870
Fate Delivers upside
down and back to front

685
01:07:52,430 --> 01:07:56,430
l've more to say than ever, but they shunt
me back and forth all day from bed to chair

686
01:07:57,390 --> 01:07:59,710
and back to bed again, it isn't fair

687
01:07:59,710 --> 01:08:03,710
All this experience l'd like to share
not that it all adds up, not that you care

688
01:08:06,910 --> 01:08:10,910
l'd better stop, it's time for you to go already
isn't it? Five minutes, oh, well maybe ten...

689
01:08:13,030 --> 01:08:16,830
you see, l never know when
you'll be here again, it's such a blow

690
01:08:16,830 --> 01:08:20,830
Each time you leave, it's hardly
worth your while to come at all, l mean it

691
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:24,830
Don't you smile like that
oh you'll be sorry when l'm dead

692
01:08:27,150 --> 01:08:31,150
l'm only joking, dear, l only said that
for a laugh, although, of course it's true

693
01:08:34,030 --> 01:08:38,030
The questions that you never asked...
yes, you will certainly regret a thing or two

694
01:08:48,710 --> 01:08:52,710
No one explained to me when l was
young why time only goes forward

695
01:08:55,430 --> 01:08:59,430
Hold your tongue was what they said when
l asked them about the universe and such

696
01:09:00,030 --> 01:09:03,510
And why we can't do all that much
about it when we make a mess of things

697
01:09:03,510 --> 01:09:07,510
lf only a mistake could be corrected
wind life back and start again...

698
01:09:09,470 --> 01:09:13,470
The second time we'd know the
art of living, but we only get one go

699
01:09:14,710 --> 01:09:18,710
No dress rehearsals, this one is
the show and we don't know it...

700
01:09:21,950 --> 01:09:25,950
l don't see the rhyme or reason
in this so-called grand design...

701
01:09:27,950 --> 01:09:31,950
But then l don't believe, there is no sign
of him up there as far as l'm concerned

702
01:09:34,950 --> 01:09:38,950
See... if there's one thing that l've
truly learned it's this: it's down to me

703
01:09:44,910 --> 01:09:48,910
And you, of course

704
01:09:58,950 --> 01:10:02,950
Each one of us is it, we are the source
of all the bad... and of the good things too

705
01:10:13,390 --> 01:10:17,390
Well, out with it, what's happening with you?
At last you've got some color in your cheeks

706
01:10:17,430 --> 01:10:19,230
l haven't seen you
look this way in weeks

707
01:10:19,230 --> 01:10:21,870
Or maybe months
it even could be years

708
01:10:21,870 --> 01:10:25,870
Don't tell me... you're in
love, aren't you my dear?

709
01:10:27,670 --> 01:10:31,510
Not with that English
chap, what a mistake!

710
01:10:31,510 --> 01:10:34,390
l knew it from the start

711
01:10:34,390 --> 01:10:36,870
lt only takes another one to come along

712
01:10:36,870 --> 01:10:40,870
and then your heart tells you that
frankly speaking, men are not all equal

713
01:10:41,790 --> 01:10:43,990
Some are better, love

714
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:47,990
lt's just another trick from that one up above
if He exists, which He, or She, does not

715
01:10:51,550 --> 01:10:55,550
Unless l didn't notice, or forgot
but l've a perfect memory...

716
01:10:57,110 --> 01:11:01,110
l lie here running through the lot, l think
l'll die with all that information tucked away

717
01:11:03,990 --> 01:11:07,990
l'd trade in all of it for
just one day, in Cuba

718
01:11:08,150 --> 01:11:12,150
- Auntie? What did you say?
- You heard me, Cuba

719
01:11:13,190 --> 01:11:17,190
l'd love to see the place, the people
the reality of how it all turned out

720
01:11:19,950 --> 01:11:23,950
And Castro... Castro gave us hope he did
oh yes, he's better than the Pope...

721
01:11:27,030 --> 01:11:30,070
l'd love to shake his hand

722
01:11:30,070 --> 01:11:33,150
- You should go soon
- Yes

723
01:11:33,150 --> 01:11:37,150
l tell you, we'll be living on the moon
before we have another go like that

724
01:11:37,550 --> 01:11:41,550
A great big dream that's fallen pretty flat
in all the other countries where they tried

725
01:11:43,310 --> 01:11:44,950
they'll regret it

726
01:11:44,950 --> 01:11:47,950
Communism died, but
what came in it's place?

727
01:11:47,950 --> 01:11:51,950
A load of greed, a life spent
longing for things you don't need

728
01:12:50,990 --> 01:12:54,990
lf and when l die
l want to see you cry

729
01:12:55,910 --> 01:12:59,910
l want to see you tear your hair
your howls of anguish fill the air

730
01:13:00,230 --> 01:13:04,190
l want to see you beat your breast
and rent your clothes and all the rest

731
01:13:04,190 --> 01:13:08,190
And, sobbing, fall upon my bed
l want to know that l am dead

732
01:13:11,990 --> 01:13:15,990
l want to know l'm part of you and that
you cannot bear me being torn away

733
01:13:17,150 --> 01:13:18,830
l want to see you dressed in black

734
01:13:18,830 --> 01:13:22,150
with red-rimmed eyes from
sleepless nights of grieving

735
01:13:22,150 --> 01:13:24,790
l want to hear you protest at me leaving

736
01:13:24,790 --> 01:13:28,350
l want to see you in each
other's arms, and wailing

737
01:13:28,350 --> 01:13:30,590
See you kick a chair
and punch the wall

738
01:13:30,590 --> 01:13:34,110
and see you, moaning, fall
upon the ground and scream

739
01:13:34,110 --> 01:13:38,110
l want to know this isn't just a dream

740
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:44,750
l want my death to be just like my life

741
01:13:45,310 --> 01:13:48,430
l want the mess, the
struggle, and the strife

742
01:13:48,430 --> 01:13:51,310
l want to fight and
see you fight for me

743
01:13:51,310 --> 01:13:55,030
l want to hear your last regrets, the
things you wish you'd done and said

744
01:13:55,030 --> 01:13:58,710
ln fact l'd like that
just before l'm dead

745
01:13:58,710 --> 01:14:02,710
Don't let them put you off
or make you go, or say it's bad

746
01:14:03,270 --> 01:14:06,470
For me, or makes it hard for
me to leave... it won't be true

747
01:14:06,470 --> 01:14:10,470
l want to see you grieve

748
01:14:12,790 --> 01:14:16,710
Don't let me drown
in silence all pious and polite...

749
01:14:16,710 --> 01:14:20,710
Let's make a lot of noise!
A different kind of light will fill the room

750
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:25,590
l want my death to wake
you up and clean you out

751
01:14:27,790 --> 01:14:31,390
And as l end l'll hear you shout

752
01:14:31,390 --> 01:14:35,390
- No, no
- But l will go

753
01:14:36,950 --> 01:14:40,950
No, please don't die

754
01:14:55,830 --> 01:14:59,830
Life is so short and precious, let's
not waste what we've been given

755
01:15:02,910 --> 01:15:06,030
Look, we have not faced the truth

756
01:15:06,030 --> 01:15:10,030
Even the rages we express perhaps
contain the seeds of happiness

757
01:15:12,750 --> 01:15:14,710
- Let's go... let's go to Cuba
- What?

758
01:15:14,710 --> 01:15:16,310
Far away

759
01:15:16,310 --> 01:15:20,310
From everyone, we've never spent a day
and night together, only an hour or two

760
01:15:22,870 --> 01:15:26,870
Let's take the time
for just me and you...

761
01:15:27,110 --> 01:15:31,110
- l'm in Beirut
- You are?

762
01:15:32,190 --> 01:15:35,550
l have a friend we trained
and worked together

763
01:15:35,550 --> 01:15:39,550
ln the end he stayed
he's married, now he has a son

764
01:15:40,310 --> 01:15:43,110
There's only one life, this is it

765
01:15:43,110 --> 01:15:47,110
Let's seize the time, l'll send
a ticket to you... l'll go on ahead...

766
01:15:48,790 --> 01:15:51,670
- lt's many years...
- Since you have been there?

767
01:15:51,670 --> 01:15:55,670
My auntie died, she
died, my aunt is dead

768
01:15:56,270 --> 01:16:00,270
You'll have a lot to say, a lot
to share, l'll send the ticket anyway

769
01:16:25,030 --> 01:16:29,030
Dirt doesn't go, it just
gets moved around

770
01:16:31,150 --> 01:16:35,150
Some things get burnt
or buried in the ground

771
01:16:35,270 --> 01:16:39,270
But fire makes smoke
and soot and greasy grime

772
01:16:39,830 --> 01:16:42,790
And buried stuff
crops up after a time...

773
01:16:42,790 --> 01:16:46,790
lt travels slowly, one could say it creeps

774
01:16:48,830 --> 01:16:52,830
lt's all the water underneath, it seeps

775
01:16:53,550 --> 01:16:57,550
God gave us eyes that do not
see too much or we'd go mad

776
01:16:59,790 --> 01:17:03,790
We'd never want to touch
a bed again, a sofa or a chair

777
01:17:04,830 --> 01:17:08,830
lf we could see the
things that live in there

778
01:17:10,310 --> 01:17:14,310
There's millions of them
loads of things with legs

779
01:17:14,910 --> 01:17:18,910
They fornicate and then
they lay their eggs...

780
01:17:18,990 --> 01:17:22,990
They think our dirt is lovely, they
survive by eating what we shed

781
01:17:23,110 --> 01:17:27,110
They are alive because
bits of us are dead

782
01:17:36,310 --> 01:17:40,310
Now, smaller than the mites are germs

783
01:17:40,510 --> 01:17:44,510
Well, we do what we can, we scrub
and scrub but they fly when we sneeze

784
01:17:46,670 --> 01:17:50,070
on drops of moisture
packed out with disease

785
01:17:50,070 --> 01:17:53,150
then all we have to do is take a breath

786
01:17:53,150 --> 01:17:56,550
and they're inside us
fighting to the death

787
01:17:56,550 --> 01:18:00,550
lt's not just germs, it seems
they're not the worst

788
01:18:01,150 --> 01:18:05,150
There's viruses, some say they were the first
things to exist, and 'cause they are so small

789
01:18:08,190 --> 01:18:10,550
They can't be cleaned
away, no, not at all

790
01:18:10,550 --> 01:18:14,550
Not ever, that's why, really, in the end
there's no such thing as spotless...

791
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:22,110
You just send the dirt to
somewhere else, push it around

792
01:18:22,230 --> 01:18:26,230
The work is endless
that is what l've found

793
01:18:32,550 --> 01:18:35,870
Maybe this earth is just a ball of fluff

794
01:18:35,870 --> 01:18:39,150
Some great big cleaner
out there said: enough

795
01:18:39,150 --> 01:18:43,150
And that is how we all survived, why not?
We're just the parasites that God forgot

796
01:18:46,710 --> 01:18:49,950
The point is this, we never disappear
despite it being what we all most fear

797
01:18:49,950 --> 01:18:51,830
We're certainly not
finished when we die

798
01:18:51,830 --> 01:18:55,830
However hard the undertakers try
every single creature feeds another

799
01:18:56,870 --> 01:19:00,870
Everyone is everybody's mother...
or, at the very least, a kind of host

800
01:19:01,230 --> 01:19:05,230
When we expire perhaps we
change, at most, but never vanish

801
01:19:05,230 --> 01:19:09,230
No, we leave a stain
a fingerprint, some mess

802
01:19:11,670 --> 01:19:15,670
Perhaps some pain, some fear
or doubt in someone else's heart

803
01:19:18,910 --> 01:19:22,910
Mum?

804
01:19:28,270 --> 01:19:32,270
We leave a mess
in fact, when we depart

805
01:26:14,350 --> 01:26:18,350
God if you exist...
l need to confess

806
01:26:24,710 --> 01:26:28,550
Please speak to me, just once
don't make me guess your point of view

807
01:26:28,550 --> 01:26:31,470
for l might get it wrong...

808
01:26:31,470 --> 01:26:35,470
l know l have strayed so far
l don't belong in any church of yours

809
01:26:36,070 --> 01:26:40,070
l sang the song of science
yes, l sang it every day

810
01:26:41,550 --> 01:26:45,550
But, l could argue, that is how l pray

811
01:26:46,070 --> 01:26:49,070
For twenty years, God, can it be?

812
01:26:49,070 --> 01:26:53,070
l've cut, dissected, carefully and with
respect each living cell a source of wonder

813
01:26:56,350 --> 01:27:00,350
Yes l tried to see
to penetrate your mystery

814
01:27:02,510 --> 01:27:06,510
The point is, God, you never lie
but you have secrets so have l

815
01:27:11,510 --> 01:27:15,030
Now all l was has
turned to ash and doubt

816
01:27:15,030 --> 01:27:19,030
Others tasted me and
even stabbed me up

817
01:27:19,070 --> 01:27:22,870
First is blossom, then there is decay

818
01:27:22,870 --> 01:27:26,870
lmpermanence will never go away

819
01:27:27,630 --> 01:27:31,630
ln fact it is the only certainty

820
01:27:32,310 --> 01:27:36,310
There come a time when
l used to be but not quite yet

821
01:27:44,630 --> 01:27:48,630
Oh God

822
01:27:48,630 --> 01:27:52,630
Can you forgive me for not...
for not... believing in you?

823
01:27:58,670 --> 01:28:00,990
- Seniora?
- Si?

824
01:28:00,990 --> 01:28:04,990
Senior

825
01:30:05,870 --> 01:30:09,430
When you look closer
nothing goes away

826
01:30:09,430 --> 01:30:13,430
lt changes, see, like night
becomes the day and day the night

827
01:30:14,990 --> 01:30:17,910
but even that's not true:

828
01:30:17,910 --> 01:30:20,430
lt's really all about your point of view

829
01:30:20,430 --> 01:30:24,230
Depending where you're
standing on the earth...

830
01:30:24,230 --> 01:30:26,590
ln the end, it simply isn't worth

831
01:30:26,590 --> 01:30:28,950
Your while to try and
clean your life away

832
01:30:28,950 --> 01:30:32,950
You can't, for, everything
you do or say is there forever

833
01:30:33,990 --> 01:30:36,910
lt leaves evidence

834
01:30:36,910 --> 01:30:40,910
ln fact it's really only common sense
there's no such thing as nothing, not at all

835
01:30:41,990 --> 01:30:45,990
lt may be really very
very small but it's still there

836
01:30:47,470 --> 01:30:53,470
ln fact l think l'd guess that 'no'
does not exist, there's only 'yes'
