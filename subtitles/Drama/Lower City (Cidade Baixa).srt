1
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,869
- Bye. Good luck.
- Thanks. Same to you.

2
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,056
- How much?
- 2.20.

3
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:15,924
You know of any trucks
heading for Salvador?

4
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:17,730
One just left.

5
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:22,537
Looking for a ride, babe?

6
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:23,802
You going by truck?

7
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,934
Boat.

8
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:34,178
It's a pleasure, sir. Take care.

9
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:35,754
You headed for Salvador?

10
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:36,913
Yeah.

11
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:40,083
Maybe I could catch a ride with you.

12
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:41,888
- And what do we get?
- What do you mean?

13
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:45,520
You know.

14
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:49,264
For 50 plus the ride,
you get what you want.

15
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:50,893
The works?

16
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,469
50 just for the basics.

17
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,101
What about 30 plus the ride?

18
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:00,610
40.

19
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:02,340
40's cool, right?

20
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:05,508
- 40 for both of us.
- That's what I'm saying, for both.

21
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:18,221
What do you say?

22
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:21,723
Let's do it.

23
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:30,766
I'm up.

24
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,915
Make yourself at home.

25
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:44,819
Pardon me, sir.

26
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:11,311
- What's the score?
- 1-0.

27
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,907
Take the helm.

28
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,419
You moan like hell.

29
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:18,649
You howl like an ambulance.

30
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,625
And you're the werewolf
with the little meat.

31
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:49,354
Cool!

32
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,194
You going to hang out a while
in Salvador?

33
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,566
Yeah, maybe I'll grab myself a gringo.

34
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:06,002
You from around here?

35
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:08,005
No, from Vitória.

36
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:09,233
Vitória up north?

37
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:10,502
Vitória down south.

38
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,271
No way!

39
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:13,640
Cool!

40
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:16,109
You know the place?

41
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:19,479
He doesn't know shit.
He's never been out of the state.

42
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:21,553
Hold this for me.

43
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,451
Give me the cigarette.

44
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:25,420
Hold it straight.

45
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:08,298
Got 100 says he'll drop in 12!

46
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:09,560
100 says he drops in 40!

47
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:24,506
That white rooster is a killer!
Come on, Whitey!

48
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:27,382
Come on, Whitey, give him hell!

49
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:28,647
Give him hell!

50
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:30,248
I'm paying 20 to 10!

51
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:32,324
Come on, you bunch of sorry-asses!

52
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:38,795
Come on, Whitey!

53
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:50,039
40 to 10, you dogs!

54
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:04,118
Who wants to bet more?

55
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,919
What the fuck
is wrong with him, Deco?

56
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:12,225
I'm paying 40 to 10, motherfuckers!

57
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:18,969
Hey, brother, you with the big head!
Hey, you big head!

58
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:22,336
40 to 10, my ass!
I'm paying 100 flat on the Whitey!

59
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,704
What the hell? Are you crazy?

60
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,973
That fool's got 100
on the white chicken!

61
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,239
I got 100 on the Black Cock!

62
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:30,076
I'm going to make soup
out of your chicken!

63
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:33,018
Come on!

64
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,046
And I'm taking 100 from that sucker!

65
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:50,731
Come on, Whitey, come on!

66
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:52,768
Go, Black!

67
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:55,033
Let's see who's the fool!

68
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:57,165
Go, go, go!

69
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:59,141
Go, Whitey!

70
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:00,643
Go!

71
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:18,420
All right, man, pay up!

72
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,707
Fuck, my rooster had it in the bag!

73
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:33,870
- In the bag, your ass!
- Fucking ninja rooster.

74
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,073
- You crazy?
- Whitey is a samurai, bro.

75
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:41,711
You ask me, that Black Cock
was doped up.

76
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:45,382
If I'd known he was doped up...

77
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:47,686
The gentleman is offering me a ride
to Salvador.

78
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,852
- What?
- I'm going to take it.

79
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:53,488
I'll get there faster by truck.

80
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,836
- Hey, Deco, check this out.
- What's wrong, babe?

81
00:08:57,937 --> 00:08:59,837
See you around some time.

82
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:07,135
Where you going?

83
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:08,440
Give me a shot of rum.

84
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:11,843
Hey, you.

85
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:13,680
You up for a rematch?

86
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:17,119
No, thanks, brother, we're cool.

87
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,918
You his husband or just his boyfriend?

88
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:19,889
What's wrong with you?

89
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:22,119
Hey, man, chill out, you hear?

90
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:26,460
You won your bet,
and now you're fucking with us?

91
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,760
Just joking.

92
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:31,098
Hey, man, stop fucking with us, hear?
Chill, man.

93
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:33,569
Do I know you?

94
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:35,300
Cool.

95
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,536
Just messing around.

96
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:42,612
Have a drink. It's on me.

97
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:45,513
After all, I'm paying for it
with your money.

98
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:47,984
Drink up, and we'll bet again.

99
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:51,284
What are you sad about?

100
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:54,325
You're alive.
It's the rooster that's dead.

101
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,918
Come on, bottoms up, darkie!

102
00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:00,055
Hey, that's a good one, bottoms up!

103
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:07,832
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You looking for trouble, man?

104
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,999
- You just hanging?
- What's your problem?

105
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:13,545
Back off, man.
Don't push my brother.

106
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:18,083
You're fucking with us, so chill out.

107
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:23,482
Go sleep it off, man.

108
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:26,123
Look what I found.
I'll beat the shit out of him.

109
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:28,284
Chill out, man.
Come on, let's split this dive.

110
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,453
How much do we owe here?

111
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,555
Check, please.

112
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:41,696
I got 50 on the white rooster!

113
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:45,233
What the hell you looking at?

114
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:48,874
Think I'm pretty?

115
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:52,644
- I don't want you staring at me!
- Fuck off, motherfucker!

116
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:54,447
Relax, man.

117
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:56,413
Let's go, brother.

118
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:58,513
How much do we owe here?

119
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:03,154
Fucking buzzard!
You son of a bitch!

120
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:18,939
Holy shit!

121
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:54,678
Come on, Naldinho!

122
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:03,051
Wait here.
I'm going to cast off the boat.

123
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:05,453
- I'm losing it!
- Sit there.

124
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:09,260
Just sit here.

125
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:11,886
I'm right here, my brother.

126
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:13,830
Easy, easy!

127
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,366
Help me untie the boat!

128
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:19,529
Let's go, babe.

129
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:21,105
Hold him right there!

130
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,267
- Are you going to stay?
- Wait a second.

131
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:28,772
Help me! Easy!

132
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:30,644
Help, for Christ's sake!

133
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:39,681
I'm bleeding like hell.

134
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,327
Easy, we're almost there.

135
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,919
Fucking hole in my stomach.

136
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:48,796
Hold my hand.

137
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:51,735
Come on, Deco,
get me out of here, brother.

138
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,240
I don't want to die!

139
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:01,535
Relax. Just hold my hand.

140
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:05,744
Don't let go of my hand.

141
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:08,550
Just breathe.

142
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:30,706
Marinalva!

143
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:34,569
Marinalva! Marinalva!

144
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,409
Wait a second!

145
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:41,877
It's Naldinho, Marinalva!
He got stabbed! Open up!

146
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:45,014
If he's all fucked up, why don't you
take him to the hospital?

147
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:47,217
We got into a fight in Cachoeira!

148
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,317
Open the goddamn door!

149
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:52,193
I don't want to get involved.

150
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:57,035
Marinalva! Marinalva!

151
00:13:57,136 --> 00:14:00,230
For Christ's sake, open up!

152
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,808
Faster, faster!

153
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:14,916
Come on!

154
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:33,661
Careful with his head.

155
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,240
Watch the leg! Watch the leg!

156
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:47,811
Take care of him
while I call a doctor.

157
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:10,795
Hey, Doc.

158
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:14,768
What is it?

159
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:19,041
An inch to the side,
and he'd have been a goner.

160
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:35,093
I'll settle the rest with you
next week.

161
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:37,457
Who do you think I am,
Mother Teresa?

162
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:27,561
Dois Mundos!

163
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,133
- What's up, champ?
- I'm cool.

164
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:31,168
- You checking out the market?
- You got it.

165
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:34,603
Hey, my friend,
you know of any cargo jobs?

166
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:36,640
Business is slow.

167
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:41,975
Nothing that I know of, but if
anything shows up, I'll let you know.

168
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:42,842
Cool.

169
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:47,817
Dois Mundos, I need a little up front.
Can you help me out?

170
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,945
An advance?

171
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:53,183
With business slow like this?

172
00:19:54,159 --> 00:20:01,497
But I do have a little job
on the side, know what I mean?

173
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:10,064
Brand-new piece, never been fired,
but you only get paid after the job.

174
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:15,237
No, Dois Mundos. I'm clean now.

175
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:18,246
So now you're Mr. Pussy?

176
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:21,581
- Here's the sucker.
- Fool!

177
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:24,315
Making like a heavyweight.

178
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:33,060
She split this afternoon.

179
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,564
She's gone.

180
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:43,333
Left some food for us.

181
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:54,118
Must not have enjoyed your slapping
her monkey last night.

182
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,391
What the hell, brother?

183
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,760
You did it with her?

184
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:12,497
You two didn't even
wait for me to get better.

185
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,441
Hey, you find any action?

186
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:21,375
No, nothing, zero.

187
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:25,644
Marinalva came around this morning
for the rent money on the room.

188
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:28,515
Tell her to stick the rent
up her fat ass.

189
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:36,023
Shit!

190
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:42,499
Marinalva has a huge ass!

191
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:47,569
Sorry-ass piece of huge ass!

192
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:25,339
- Hey, Franciel!
- What's up, Deco?

193
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:28,445
Baldy.

194
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:30,713
Where you been?

195
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:35,617
Looking for work.
You know of anything?

196
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:38,781
I need somebody to spar with Franciel.
You up for it?

197
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:40,949
Stop by to talk it over.

198
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:42,754
Right.

199
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,351
Peace!

200
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:29,103
You crazy, drinking?

201
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:31,675
You're on antibiotics.

202
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:33,870
What's wrong, Deco?

203
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,573
You're pissed because of her?

204
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:43,316
You mad, Naldinho?

205
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:45,613
Dig it, Rufino.

206
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:47,919
Deco's in love with that whore.

207
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:49,425
In love with a hooker.

208
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:51,119
Piss off, Rufino.
I didn't ask for your opinion.

209
00:23:51,229 --> 00:23:54,426
Hey, Fua, he's pissed
'cause the whore split on him.

210
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:55,591
He's lucky.

211
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:59,568
I had it worse with a whore
called Michelle up in the Amazon.

212
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:02,868
I started sniffing and feeling her up,

213
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:06,068
and look
at the size of the cock I found!

214
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:28,182
We used to hang out here
when we were kids.

215
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,484
It was cool.

216
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:36,163
Deco used to eye the dames
taking their brats swimming.

217
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:39,362
When they weren't looking,
I'd grab their stuff, right, Deco?

218
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:44,238
We'd split up that street over there.
Shit, we only got caught once, right?

219
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:45,900
'Cause you were
sleeping on your feet.

220
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:49,071
Sleeping on my feet?

221
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:51,171
Dig, bro, just standing there
like a fool.

222
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:54,013
You are always showing off.

223
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:55,450
I wasn't sleeping
on my goddamn feet.

224
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,181
Just standing there
like a mummy, bro.

225
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:58,688
Hey!

226
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:02,389
Hold this.

227
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:09,757
So many pothead bitches
fucking for free,

228
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:11,802
the gringos never
come around anymore.

229
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,700
We have to go door-to-door.

230
00:26:13,805 --> 00:26:15,602
Where do you know them from?

231
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:17,504
He's my cousin.

232
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:19,600
And him?

233
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:24,148
He's the son
of my aunt's cleaning lady.

234
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:29,880
You take the girls back and forth
from the ships and get 5%.

235
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:31,580
5%?

236
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,157
10%. 5% for each.

237
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,954
And you can pick up some action
on the side.

238
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:37,858
And you cover for gas, right?

239
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:40,329
Right, she covers the gas.

240
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:13,287
Good evening!

241
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:17,323
So? How much?

242
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:18,299
40.

243
00:27:18,403 --> 00:27:19,233
40.

244
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:21,703
40 is too much! Too much!

245
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:24,036
No, no, no, good price, 40.

246
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,939
Too much money, <i>muchachas.</i> 20.

247
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:28,171
Look, <i>muchacho.</i>

248
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:31,305
20, only blow job.

249
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:34,078
30, all included.

250
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:40,447
Okay, <i>muchachos</i>. Deal, 30.

251
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:42,526
Come here.

252
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,769
Can you see from there?

253
00:28:42,787 --> 00:28:43,811
Help!

254
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:44,980
Holy shit!

255
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,387
Look, man!

256
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:48,049
Holy fuck!

257
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,717
What is this, man?

258
00:28:53,631 --> 00:28:54,461
What's this shit?

259
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,625
Karinna!

260
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:59,431
Hey, man, we need a doctor!

261
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:01,528
A doctor, understand?

262
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:04,301
Get on the radio, man!
Call a fucking doctor!

263
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:07,640
Take it easy!
No fucking cops on board, you hear?

264
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:10,476
Shit, man, the woman's dying!
Get a fucking doctor, man!

265
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,743
The woman's dying,
and you're pissing around!

266
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:14,318
Here, take her to the hospital!

267
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,819
What the fuck? Keep it, man!
Did I ask you for money?

268
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:19,116
I'm telling you to call
a fucking doctor!

269
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:20,191
Don't take the money, Deco!

270
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:23,055
Help! Help!

271
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:26,129
You just going to let the girl
die here, is that it?

272
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:26,959
Help!

273
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:29,033
I'll beat the shit
out of that white-ass gringo!

274
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:33,400
Easy! Take it!
That's all I've got!

275
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:40,135
The drinks are on me.

276
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:41,678
He's buying for me.

277
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,544
Hey, the man's buying!
He's got money!

278
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:46,913
150!

279
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:54,985
For a while, I thought
you were really having an attack.

280
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:58,688
I just felt sorry for that little
whitey, shaking like a leaf.

281
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:02,358
That sorry-ass captain was worse.

282
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:06,369
Fuck! All he could say was,
"Look, <i>muchacho!"</i>

283
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:10,066
"Look, <i>muchacho"</i>
must be that fool's mother.

284
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:12,336
"Look, <i>muchacho!"</i>

285
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:09,105
Come on! Stop!

286
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:11,566
Break it up!

287
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:13,837
Go take a breather.

288
00:35:15,346 --> 00:35:17,280
What's wrong with you, Deco?

289
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:22,278
Next week there's
a tournament in Muritiba.

290
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:25,753
If you want,
I can arrange a fight for you.

291
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:28,257
50-50.

292
00:35:28,926 --> 00:35:30,393
Thanks.

293
00:36:16,774 --> 00:36:18,742
Hey, you leaving?

294
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:21,311
- Yeah.
- So early?

295
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:33,754
<i>In just five minutes,</i>

296
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:38,989
<i>a super-sexy number by Brenda,</i>
<i>the princess of Xanadoo.</i>

297
00:36:41,832 --> 00:36:43,060
Got a smoke?

298
00:36:46,103 --> 00:36:47,434
Thanks.

299
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:55,609
What's up, babe?

300
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,237
What's up?

301
00:36:57,348 --> 00:36:59,339
I'll have a Cuba Libre, please.

302
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:03,017
When you going to ditch that sucker?

303
00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:06,280
What's it to you?

304
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:10,020
So we make a little love,
nice and wet.

305
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:16,662
Hanging with you two is just for fun,
but I've got bills to pay.

306
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:42,188
The usual trick is 37.

307
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:46,254
If you want something sexier...

308
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,233
- Sexier?
- Yeah.

309
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:50,766
How much is the sexiest?

310
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:52,802
60.

311
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:53,995
60?

312
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,902
Let's do it.

313
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:57,702
Want to turn off the light?

314
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:07,746
Hey, brother.

315
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:12,020
I was going to call you,
but you were out cold,

316
00:38:12,757 --> 00:38:15,055
so I let you sleep.

317
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:31,207
Dois Mundos came around earlier.

318
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,368
Says he's got some cargo for us
to take to Cachoeira.

319
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:34,808
Cachoeira?

320
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:42,210
If you're waiting for Karinna,
she's going to be a while.

321
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,810
The fat john is a V.I.P.

322
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:47,413
Pays good, but it takes him an hour
just to get it up.

323
00:39:11,248 --> 00:39:14,115
Dois Mundos says there's somebody
making an offer on the boat.

324
00:39:14,218 --> 00:39:17,051
We sell the boat for shit,
and then what?

325
00:39:17,154 --> 00:39:20,123
They're hiring the sailors back
to work for them.

326
00:39:20,224 --> 00:39:23,284
We do the hard work, and they just
sit on their asses sipping scotch.

327
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:24,884
Okay, brother.

328
00:39:26,597 --> 00:39:29,031
I hear what you're saying.

329
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:52,280
Deco, you're my main man.

330
00:39:57,194 --> 00:40:01,096
My respect for you is worth
more than a piece of pussy.

331
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:03,897
Hell, brother, my respect for you

332
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:07,334
is worth more than all the pussy
in the world.

333
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:13,206
Show me a huge piece of pussy,
and I'd take your friendship any day.

334
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:15,141
Come here.
Let me give you a kiss.

335
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:18,113
- Come here.
- No way! What the hell?

336
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:19,739
Come on.

337
00:40:22,386 --> 00:40:24,377
You're my main man, bro.

338
00:40:25,956 --> 00:40:27,389
Got it?

339
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:12,892
Hey.

340
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:19,699
Going to offer me a drink?

341
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:22,473
Serve one up, Fua.

342
00:41:29,753 --> 00:41:31,015
Thanks.

343
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:35,724
You pissed at me?

344
00:41:37,561 --> 00:41:39,085
Pissed about what?

345
00:41:40,865 --> 00:41:42,127
Beats me.

346
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:45,094
You never came back
to see me again.

347
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:49,662
I didn't leave anything behind
over there.

348
00:44:47,918 --> 00:44:50,045
Where you been, bro?

349
00:44:54,591 --> 00:44:55,819
Around.

350
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:34,725
- Hey, Naldinho!
- Just getting a trim.

351
00:45:35,299 --> 00:45:39,292
Hey, Dois Mundos, let's take care
of some business, brother.

352
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:46,967
Sit up.

353
00:45:57,554 --> 00:45:59,784
- How old are you?
- 20.

354
00:46:01,558 --> 00:46:03,082
Job?

355
00:46:03,193 --> 00:46:04,660
Dancer.

356
00:46:05,129 --> 00:46:06,562
Address?

357
00:46:07,297 --> 00:46:10,289
I'm moving.
No address right now.

358
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:13,099
When was your last period?

359
00:46:15,472 --> 00:46:17,804
You know you're pregnant?

360
00:46:21,245 --> 00:46:23,008
You can get dressed now.

361
00:46:23,814 --> 00:46:26,248
I want to come back here
and find the engine running.

362
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:29,786
If you're not here waiting for me,
I'll come after you, hear?

363
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:32,913
You think I'm going to run, brother?
Go with the Lord, man!

364
00:46:33,023 --> 00:46:35,753
The car will be running
when you get here!

365
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:46,263
Hey, man, give me some
of that headache medicine.

366
00:46:46,904 --> 00:46:48,462
3.50.

367
00:46:48,572 --> 00:46:49,231
What, man?

368
00:46:49,339 --> 00:46:51,933
The medicine, it's 3.50.

369
00:47:05,956 --> 00:47:08,652
- You're short.
- What, man?

370
00:47:08,759 --> 00:47:10,989
You gave me 2.30.

371
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:21,399
Come on, freak, open the door!
Don't look at me!

372
00:47:21,638 --> 00:47:23,970
Open the door,
and don't look me in the face!

373
00:47:24,074 --> 00:47:24,904
You crazy?

374
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:26,066
Open the door!
Don't look at my face!

375
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:27,837
- I need the key!
- What key, boy?

376
00:47:27,945 --> 00:47:30,436
- Open the door!
- The key to open the door!

377
00:47:30,547 --> 00:47:32,777
Open the fucking door.

378
00:47:32,883 --> 00:47:35,078
Nice and slow.

379
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:36,413
Come on.

380
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,214
Come on.

381
00:47:37,321 --> 00:47:39,084
- Don't look at me.
- Take it easy.

382
00:47:40,157 --> 00:47:41,488
Grab the money!

383
00:47:41,592 --> 00:47:42,923
Get over there!
Don't look me in the face!

384
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:44,653
Business has been slow!

385
00:47:44,761 --> 00:47:47,355
Business slow, my ass! I saw a dame
leaving here full of medicine!

386
00:47:47,464 --> 00:47:48,897
- Give me the money!
- She paid with her credit card!

387
00:47:48,999 --> 00:47:50,057
I'm going to blast your face!

388
00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:51,930
- I swear to God, she paid on credit!
- Don't bullshit me!

389
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:55,368
I came here for the goddamn money,
and I want it now!

390
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:05,810
Shit, brother.

391
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:07,406
Relax, brother. Were you hit?

392
00:48:08,252 --> 00:48:10,447
Let me go.

393
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:13,284
What the fuck, fool?
Clean yourself up.

394
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:14,584
Let me go.

395
00:48:14,691 --> 00:48:15,453
Relax.

396
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:19,655
Look at me!
Relax! Look at me!

397
00:48:19,763 --> 00:48:22,254
- You alone here?
- I'm all alone, man.

398
00:48:22,366 --> 00:48:24,596
Edvan, relax, brother.
I'm not going to hurt you, okay?

399
00:48:24,701 --> 00:48:27,261
It was an accident.

400
00:48:27,371 --> 00:48:28,565
What do you want?

401
00:48:28,672 --> 00:48:31,641
You got that shit the old granddaddies
have been taking?

402
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:33,209
What?

403
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:36,541
That pill they take to get it up.

404
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:37,841
Don't look at me!

405
00:48:37,948 --> 00:48:39,848
- Get the pills!
- Easy! Which one do you want?

406
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:42,180
Give me the most expensive shit
you have. Stuff it in my backpack.

407
00:48:42,286 --> 00:48:44,277
I'm helping you. Take it easy.

408
00:48:44,388 --> 00:48:46,322
Damn!
Stuff that shit in my backpack!

409
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:50,086
Got two great products, one for
balding and another for losing weight.

410
00:48:50,193 --> 00:48:52,753
I'm not asking you anything!
Just put what I told you in the bag!

411
00:48:52,863 --> 00:48:54,797
It's worth 100 a box, man!

412
00:48:55,732 --> 00:48:57,165
- One box?
- Sure, man.

413
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:58,757
So fill up the bag. Move it.

414
00:48:58,869 --> 00:49:01,497
Stuff it all in there!

415
00:49:02,973 --> 00:49:05,339
Sit down! I said, sit down!

416
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:08,409
Piss-pants!

417
00:49:35,238 --> 00:49:36,296
What the hell is this?

418
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,533
That's what I'm asking you,
what the fuck?

419
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:40,075
Belongs to Dois Mundos.

420
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:43,476
What do you want this piece for,
Naldinho?

421
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:45,047
Brother, this shit is fucked up!

422
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:46,615
I'm going to do a number
on a drugstore.

423
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:50,779
Dois Mundos has the place staked out.
No cops, nothing! Piece of cake!

424
00:49:50,887 --> 00:49:52,047
- I'm giving this shit back.
- No way!

425
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:54,350
- Not until I do the next drugstore!
- I sure am!

426
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:55,550
Give me the piece, brother!

427
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:57,319
Give me the fucking piece!

428
00:49:57,427 --> 00:49:58,621
Give it to me!

429
00:49:58,729 --> 00:49:59,593
Let go!

430
00:49:59,696 --> 00:50:00,788
Give me the piece!

431
00:50:00,897 --> 00:50:05,027
Let go, brother!

432
00:50:05,135 --> 00:50:06,124
Fucking shit!

433
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:28,055
Sorry, man.

434
00:50:28,158 --> 00:50:29,625
Sorry for what, man?

435
00:50:32,295 --> 00:50:34,456
You want to get messed up?
Go ahead, fool!

436
00:50:34,564 --> 00:50:36,725
Messed up in your shit again! Do it!

437
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:38,824
It's over for me, man!

438
00:50:38,935 --> 00:50:40,197
History!

439
00:53:07,651 --> 00:53:13,180
<i>Let's have a round of applause</i>
<i>for Karinna, our blonde volcano!</i>

440
00:53:17,427 --> 00:53:18,724
Can I get some change?

441
00:53:18,828 --> 00:53:22,594
<i>In a few minutes,</i>
<i>another number by Sirlene,</i>

442
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:24,997
<i>our delicious black panther!</i>

443
00:53:34,077 --> 00:53:36,705
Hey! Want to go upstairs?

444
00:53:36,813 --> 00:53:37,871
Not now, babe.

445
00:53:37,981 --> 00:53:39,812
I'm paying tonight.

446
00:53:42,586 --> 00:53:43,917
Come on.

447
00:54:20,857 --> 00:54:23,451
No, don't take it off.

448
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,084
Don't take it off.

449
00:54:41,511 --> 00:54:43,775
I was thinking...

450
00:54:47,183 --> 00:54:49,117
I've got some new action.

451
00:54:56,226 --> 00:54:58,251
I want to take you out of here.

452
00:54:59,529 --> 00:55:00,325
Action?

453
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:06,034
I pulled off a job.

454
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:12,097
We can sell the stuff
and chill for a while.

455
00:55:13,076 --> 00:55:15,101
What job?

456
00:55:16,713 --> 00:55:19,307
Some medicine shit.

457
00:55:19,416 --> 00:55:21,043
You got it?

458
00:55:22,752 --> 00:55:26,813
I'm like Santa Claus
for all the limp dicks.

459
00:55:30,093 --> 00:55:31,822
Give me that.

460
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:36,295
Hot...

461
00:55:36,399 --> 00:55:39,334
Blonde...

462
00:55:59,923 --> 00:56:01,914
What about the boat?

463
00:56:05,762 --> 00:56:07,662
We're going to sell it.

464
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:17,199
I'd rather leave everything as is.

465
00:56:17,307 --> 00:56:18,569
Why?

466
00:56:21,244 --> 00:56:23,007
Because of everything.

467
00:56:33,123 --> 00:56:34,590
Because of him?

468
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:41,688
What do you want?

469
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:48,203
- I don't know.
- You have to decide.

470
00:56:48,972 --> 00:56:50,963
I can't stay away from you,
or from him either.

471
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:52,371
You have to decide!

472
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:54,772
Get out!

473
00:56:54,878 --> 00:56:57,073
Get out of here!

474
00:58:35,612 --> 00:58:37,807
I came here to talk.

475
00:58:41,484 --> 00:58:43,509
Can we go for a walk?

476
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:45,679
I'm working out.

477
00:58:45,788 --> 00:58:49,121
So stop by the club for a beer.

478
00:58:53,997 --> 00:58:55,931
I'm splitting tomorrow.

479
00:58:56,032 --> 00:59:00,093
So I'll wait for you over there,
and we'll talk after you work out.

480
00:59:21,691 --> 00:59:23,625
Don't be upset.

481
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:26,126
I hate to see you
and Naldinho fighting.

482
00:59:28,531 --> 00:59:31,659
Me and Naldinho have known
each other since we were little.

483
00:59:31,768 --> 00:59:34,202
We're not crazy to fight over a bitch.

484
00:59:36,005 --> 00:59:42,808
I don't want
anybody's warmed-over leftovers.

485
00:59:45,048 --> 00:59:47,676
Chill, you and your little boyfriend.

486
00:59:47,784 --> 00:59:51,584
I'm tired of sorry-ass fools who don't
give me a thing and think they rule.

487
00:59:51,688 --> 00:59:57,183
Get the fuck out of here,
before I smash you in the face.

488
00:59:57,293 --> 00:59:58,419
Out!

489
01:00:55,885 --> 01:00:57,876
Hey, chubby, what's your name?

490
01:00:58,021 --> 01:00:59,249
Marcelo.

491
01:00:59,355 --> 01:01:01,220
Marcelinho.

492
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:02,951
Come here. Buy me a drink.

493
01:01:03,059 --> 01:01:04,959
Today's my birthday.

494
01:01:05,061 --> 01:01:05,959
Help yourself.

495
01:01:06,062 --> 01:01:09,589
Get lost, girl.
Go dance on your own turf.

496
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:30,716
Hey, Karinna, you okay?

497
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:34,414
I'm fine.

498
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:39,253
Beautiful.

499
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:31,250
They didn't find any gunpowder
on your hands. Only on the gringo's.

500
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:34,352
But there was coke in the cabin,

501
01:05:36,732 --> 01:05:40,133
so we'll be calling you back
for more questions.

502
01:05:40,236 --> 01:05:43,797
You're in deep shit.

503
01:05:50,379 --> 01:05:51,937
Am I free to go now?

504
01:05:52,048 --> 01:05:55,950
Sure. They paid your bail.

505
01:05:58,054 --> 01:06:00,614
- Who?
- What do you mean, "who"?

506
01:06:00,723 --> 01:06:03,021
Who paid my bail?

507
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:06,720
Valmir Gonzalves dos Santos.

508
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:09,890
Valmir?

509
01:06:55,211 --> 01:06:57,839
I heard what happened to you.

510
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:01,449
You got into deep shit.

511
01:07:02,585 --> 01:07:04,678
The cops are fucked up.

512
01:07:17,133 --> 01:07:18,623
You all right?

513
01:07:21,170 --> 01:07:23,229
I just want to split here.

514
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:29,102
Where to?

515
01:07:32,248 --> 01:07:34,045
Anywhere.

516
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:38,816
The precinct captain's
got the heat on me here.

517
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:44,921
I'm living in a little flat
Dois Mundos lent me.

518
01:07:45,027 --> 01:07:45,686
Cool.

519
01:07:45,795 --> 01:07:47,092
Cool.

520
01:07:47,196 --> 01:07:47,992
It's nice.

521
01:07:51,033 --> 01:07:53,024
You could move in with me.

522
01:08:04,313 --> 01:08:05,541
Better not.

523
01:08:05,681 --> 01:08:06,773
Why?

524
01:08:08,984 --> 01:08:11,748
Move in with me.

525
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:16,816
Look at the man who's asking you
to move in with him.

526
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:26,257
Come on.

527
01:08:40,716 --> 01:08:42,240
I'm pregnant.

528
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:53,250
Pregnant?

529
01:08:58,868 --> 01:09:01,200
Really?

530
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:05,236
Cool.

531
01:09:07,543 --> 01:09:09,272
Cool.

532
01:09:21,790 --> 01:09:23,519
Move in with me.

533
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:27,793
I'll take care of you...

534
01:09:30,933 --> 01:09:32,764
...Karinna.

535
01:09:41,110 --> 01:09:44,204
Got another fight for you,
day after tomorrow.

536
01:09:45,714 --> 01:09:49,275
It's a kid, son of a hardware store
owner from around here.

537
01:09:49,385 --> 01:09:50,409
Important.

538
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:51,247
What's my cut?

539
01:09:51,353 --> 01:09:52,650
400.

540
01:09:52,755 --> 01:09:56,213
You can hit him all you want
until the third round,

541
01:09:56,325 --> 01:10:00,762
but then you have to take a dive.

542
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:04,697
Don't get me wrong,
but I think I'll pass.

543
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:11,569
You keep 500, and I'll take the rest.
Then we'll get another fight.

544
01:10:11,674 --> 01:10:15,804
You're not a kid anymore.

545
01:10:15,911 --> 01:10:18,106
Take the fight.

546
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:52,108
Dois Mundos lent me all this.

547
01:10:52,214 --> 01:10:53,943
I'm going to pay him back.

548
01:11:05,661 --> 01:11:09,097
Make yourself at home. It's free.

549
01:11:10,599 --> 01:11:12,726
The bed's beautiful.

550
01:11:12,835 --> 01:11:14,598
All white.

551
01:11:24,446 --> 01:11:26,607
Does it still hurt?

552
01:11:26,715 --> 01:11:28,706
No.

553
01:11:28,817 --> 01:11:31,012
What about here?

554
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:33,714
It doesn't hurt anymore.
It's all better.

555
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:38,920
What about here?

556
01:11:40,829 --> 01:11:43,229
- Yeah, there it hurts.
- Really?

557
01:11:43,832 --> 01:11:45,197
It hurts?

558
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:47,269
Hurts like hell.

559
01:13:08,617 --> 01:13:10,414
I picked up two more fights for you.

560
01:13:10,519 --> 01:13:15,616
Saturday in Arapiraca
and Sunday in Maceió.

561
01:13:47,456 --> 01:13:51,449
Fua, if you'd gone to school,
you wouldn't cook like this.

562
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:55,929
That's all there is, slop of the day.
The special.

563
01:13:57,599 --> 01:13:58,964
Want some more?

564
01:13:59,067 --> 01:14:00,364
What's up?

565
01:14:00,469 --> 01:14:01,458
Pour it on!

566
01:14:01,570 --> 01:14:02,093
- More?
- More.

567
01:14:02,204 --> 01:14:04,195
You disappeared?

568
01:14:04,306 --> 01:14:06,570
Here I am, man. What's up?

569
01:14:09,812 --> 01:14:13,646
I need to have a word with you.

570
01:14:16,285 --> 01:14:18,810
Later, brother.

571
01:14:26,495 --> 01:14:29,953
- You know who's been around?
- No.

572
01:14:30,065 --> 01:14:32,693
Your main man, the boxer.

573
01:14:33,569 --> 01:14:39,474
Came to me wanting to sell the boat.

574
01:14:39,575 --> 01:14:43,306
Just telling you because you're cool.
If I was you...

575
01:14:43,812 --> 01:14:44,904
Right, fellas?

576
01:14:45,013 --> 01:14:50,508
Hey, Fua! Give me a beer!

577
01:15:46,441 --> 01:15:50,241
I stopped by the club asking for you,
and they said you were here.

578
01:15:54,583 --> 01:15:55,447
Are you okay?

579
01:16:02,658 --> 01:16:03,590
Yeah.

580
01:16:03,759 --> 01:16:06,489
I'm thinking of selling the boat,
and I thought we could...

581
01:16:07,930 --> 01:16:08,692
Better not.

582
01:16:11,967 --> 01:16:12,956
Why?

583
01:16:16,572 --> 01:16:19,063
You'd end up killing each other.

584
01:17:16,031 --> 01:17:17,055
I'm pregnant.

585
01:17:23,438 --> 01:17:25,929
- I could...
- I'm splitting.

586
01:17:29,978 --> 01:17:32,139
Is that what you want?

587
01:17:47,996 --> 01:17:52,990
<i>In just a few minutes,</i>
<i>short, hot, and horny, Sirlene!</i>

588
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:00,398
Sirlene?

589
01:18:00,509 --> 01:18:01,737
What?

590
01:18:02,778 --> 01:18:06,475
The girls were saying
you're heading up north, right?

591
01:18:06,581 --> 01:18:09,414
Day after tomorrow, I'm catching
a ride on a truck to the Amazon.

592
01:18:09,518 --> 01:18:12,112
They say a blow job
is worth a gold nugget up there.

593
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:13,710
What's a nugget?

594
01:18:13,822 --> 01:18:15,312
A little gold pebble.

595
01:18:15,424 --> 01:18:18,723
I was thinking
of heading north myself.

596
01:18:18,827 --> 01:18:21,318
Maybe I could go with you.

597
01:18:22,964 --> 01:18:25,592
I've had it with those two.

598
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:27,635
They're going to end up in a mess.

599
01:18:31,173 --> 01:18:32,231
Karinna.

600
01:18:34,543 --> 01:18:36,340
Zilú told me.

601
01:18:36,445 --> 01:18:37,241
About what?

602
01:18:37,345 --> 01:18:38,812
The baby.

603
01:18:39,948 --> 01:18:41,506
How long?

604
01:18:41,616 --> 01:18:43,550
A month, tops.

605
01:18:43,652 --> 01:18:48,817
Stop around tomorrow,
and I'll get you some pills, okay?

606
01:18:48,924 --> 01:18:50,255
Cool.

607
01:19:08,910 --> 01:19:12,505
Dois Mundos, what's up?
I came by to have a word with you.

608
01:19:12,614 --> 01:19:14,605
Wait a second, bro.
Can't you see I'm eating?

609
01:19:14,716 --> 01:19:16,274
Listen.

610
01:19:16,384 --> 01:19:18,375
Man, I'm splitting this week,

611
01:19:18,487 --> 01:19:19,977
and I just stopped by to pick up
that money of mine.

612
01:19:20,088 --> 01:19:20,884
What money?

613
01:19:22,624 --> 01:19:24,057
From the medicine, Dois Mundos.

614
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:25,490
That's rent on the apartment.

615
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:27,858
Brother, if you pay me
what you owe me,

616
01:19:27,963 --> 01:19:30,056
I'll pay you the rent, Dois Mundos.

617
01:19:30,165 --> 01:19:31,462
You trying to rip me off?

618
01:19:31,566 --> 01:19:32,590
It's her.

619
01:19:32,701 --> 01:19:33,895
- She's what, man?
- It's her.

620
01:19:34,736 --> 01:19:36,328
Go fuck yourself, Dois Mundos.

621
01:19:36,438 --> 01:19:38,633
What do you mean, "it's her"?
You dissing me?

622
01:19:38,740 --> 01:19:41,106
- What the fuck is wrong?
- Bro, you sleeping on your feet?

623
01:19:41,209 --> 01:19:42,699
He doesn't even have
to keep his eye on the babe.

624
01:19:42,811 --> 01:19:44,802
- Somebody else already does.
- What's your point?

625
01:19:44,913 --> 01:19:47,108
She was hanging out
with the boxer, real tight.

626
01:19:47,215 --> 01:19:49,410
I'm going to blast you, motherfucker!

627
01:19:49,518 --> 01:19:51,713
Don't mess with me, Dois Mundos!
Let go of me!

628
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:54,084
What's wrong, man?
What the fuck, Dois Mundos?

629
01:19:54,189 --> 01:19:55,656
Even you?

630
01:19:55,757 --> 01:19:58,055
The man's just telling you,
because he's your brother, man.

631
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:00,458
What the hell, brother?
Even you?

632
01:20:01,663 --> 01:20:04,894
Go, man. Check it out!

633
01:21:06,728 --> 01:21:08,593
Why'd you do it, brother?

634
01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:15,002
I didn't do anything.

635
01:21:17,505 --> 01:21:19,996
- She's expecting my child, Deco.
- Your child, my ass!

636
01:21:20,208 --> 01:21:22,039
Fuck off!

637
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:53,251
Sit down.

638
01:24:58,093 --> 01:24:59,822
Sit down!
