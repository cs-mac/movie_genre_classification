1
00:00:55,571 --> 00:00:59,978
<i>I'm Erica Bain. And as you know,</i>
<i>I walk the city.</i>

2
00:01:00,787 --> 00:01:05,259
<i>I bitch and moan about it.</i>
<i>I walk and watch and listen...</i>

3
00:01:05,426 --> 00:01:08,177
<i>... a witness to all</i>
<i>the beauty and ugliness...</i>

4
00:01:08,339 --> 00:01:11,274
<i>... that is disappearing</i>
<i>from our beloved city.</i>

5
00:01:11,444 --> 00:01:13,964
<i>Last week took me to</i>
<i>the gray depths of the East River...</i>

6
00:01:14,131 --> 00:01:17,165
<i>... where Dimitri Panchenko</i>
<i>swims his morning laps...</i>

7
00:01:17,331 --> 00:01:20,201
<i>... like he has every morning</i>
<i>since the 1960s.</i>

8
00:01:21,908 --> 00:01:27,090
<i>Today I walked by the acres of scaffolding</i>
<i>outside what used to be the Plaza Hotel...</i>

9
00:01:27,251 --> 00:01:29,804
<i>... and I thought about Eloise.</i>

10
00:01:30,004 --> 00:01:32,688
<i>Remember Kay Thompson's Eloise?</i>

11
00:01:32,852 --> 00:01:35,634
<i>Eloise who lived in the Plaza Hotel...</i>

12
00:01:35,797 --> 00:01:39,758
<i>... with her dog Weenie and her parents,</i>
<i>who were always away...</i>

13
00:01:39,925 --> 00:01:44,234
<i>... and her English nanny who had</i>
<i>eight hairpins made out of bones.</i>

14
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:49,675
<i>That Eloise. The adored brat</i>
<i>of my childhood. A little punk kid...</i>

15
00:01:49,845 --> 00:01:54,515
<i>Sid Vicious, spewing beer from his teeth</i>
<i>in the Chelsea Hotel.</i>

16
00:01:54,677 --> 00:01:57,012
<i>Andy Warhol, his sunglasses...</i>

17
00:01:57,174 --> 00:02:01,843
<i>Edgar Allan Poe, freeing live monkeys</i>
<i>from the crates of a crumbling schooner...</i>

18
00:02:02,005 --> 00:02:05,169
<i>... on the oily slips of South Street.</i>

19
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,374
<i>Stories of a city...</i>

20
00:02:07,542 --> 00:02:11,883
<i>... that is disappearing before our eyes.</i>
<i>Its people swept over...</i>

21
00:02:12,054 --> 00:02:14,421
<i>So, what will be left of those stories?</i>

22
00:02:14,582 --> 00:02:19,535
<i>Are we going to have to construct an</i>
<i>imaginary city to house our memories?</i>

23
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:23,890
<i>Because when you love something,</i>
<i>every time a bit of it goes...</i>

24
00:02:24,055 --> 00:02:26,990
<i>... you lose a piece of yourself.</i>

25
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:31,374
<i>So where's Eloise going to sleep tonight?</i>
<i>Can you hear her ghost...</i>

26
00:02:31,542 --> 00:02:35,536
<i>... wandering around the collapsing</i>
<i>corridors of her beloved Plaza...</i>

27
00:02:35,704 --> 00:02:37,842
<i>... trying to find her nanny's room...</i>

28
00:02:38,007 --> 00:02:40,822
<i>... calling out</i>
<i>to the construction workers...</i>

29
00:02:40,983 --> 00:02:43,602
...in a voice that nobody hears:

30
00:02:43,766 --> 00:02:47,597
"Has anyone seen my turtle,
Skipperdee?"

31
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,340
This is Erica Bain, and you've been listening
to <i>Street Walk</i> on WNKW.

32
00:02:52,504 --> 00:02:55,439
- <i>And this is 90. 1, WNKW.</i>
- All right.

33
00:02:56,408 --> 00:02:59,058
- See you next week.
- Have a good one, Erica.

34
00:03:02,584 --> 00:03:04,112
Hey, I'm out of here.

35
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,484
Did Eloise really mean that much to you?

36
00:03:06,649 --> 00:03:09,432
Oh, come on, Carol.
Weren't you ever a little girl?

37
00:03:09,592 --> 00:03:12,593
Not the kind of little girl that
remembers the name of her turtle.

38
00:03:12,761 --> 00:03:14,518
Anyway, good show.

39
00:03:14,681 --> 00:03:17,682
Look, Bravo called again
about that TV spot.

40
00:03:17,849 --> 00:03:19,572
You know what? I'm...

41
00:03:19,738 --> 00:03:21,974
I'm not a face. I'm just a voice.

42
00:03:22,138 --> 00:03:25,007
The shows are on the website.
People can download them for free.

43
00:03:25,178 --> 00:03:27,316
- Yeah, exactly.
- Maybe.

44
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,163
Bye.

45
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:33,202
- Hello?
- <i>Hey.</i>

46
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:35,378
- Hello.
- <i>What are you wearing?</i>

47
00:03:35,546 --> 00:03:38,613
Green scrubs, tied at the waist,
very sexy V-neck.

48
00:03:39,418 --> 00:03:42,070
- <i>Short-sleeved little number.</i>
- How about the sexy green hat?

49
00:03:42,234 --> 00:03:43,511
- Still got that?
- <i>In my hand.</i>

50
00:03:43,674 --> 00:03:46,643
You like it more than the others,
less than the others or the same?

51
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,087
Oh, yeah. I'm at the place...

52
00:03:48,251 --> 00:03:51,599
...and I wanna make sure you're still okay
with the cream and the orange.

53
00:03:51,772 --> 00:03:52,949
Yeah, cream and orange.

54
00:03:53,115 --> 00:03:55,603
Actually, it's not cream.
It's vanilla. But that's fine.

55
00:03:55,771 --> 00:03:57,265
It's not cream. It's vanilla.

56
00:03:57,434 --> 00:04:00,731
- Who cares? Let's go get married tonight.
- <i>Your mother cares.</i>

57
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:03,030
Trust me, she wants invitations.

58
00:04:03,195 --> 00:04:05,082
Yeah, these are good. Thanks.

59
00:04:05,243 --> 00:04:08,473
Hey, listen. For tonight, if you meet me
at Nicole's art thing...

60
00:04:08,635 --> 00:04:10,524
<i>... you don't have to</i>
<i>talk to anyone but me.</i>

61
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:12,210
- <i>Maybe.</i>
- Come on.

62
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:15,380
- <i>I've got a game, haven't I?</i>
- You're not coming?

63
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:17,490
- <i>Look, I've gotta go.</i>
- What?

64
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,088
<i>I do love you.</i>

65
00:04:19,261 --> 00:04:21,563
Yeah. I love you too.

66
00:04:22,748 --> 00:04:24,691
- Hi.
- Hi. Oh, you're James.

67
00:04:25,149 --> 00:04:26,807
- I'm Erica. I'm Nicole's friend.
- Hi.

68
00:04:26,972 --> 00:04:29,591
These are good.
They're really cool. I love them.

69
00:04:29,756 --> 00:04:33,401
The Laundromat is in a town in Jersey
where Diane Arbus used to do her laundry.

70
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:36,564
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, that gun store is down in Chinatown.

71
00:04:37,342 --> 00:04:39,829
Berenice Abbott shot it in the '30s.

72
00:04:39,997 --> 00:04:42,933
It's really evocative, you know?

73
00:04:43,101 --> 00:04:46,397
Kind of quiet. I like that.
It doesn't make too much noise.

74
00:04:46,558 --> 00:04:47,539
Thanks.

75
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,850
Bring more drinks, less shrimp. More.

76
00:04:50,014 --> 00:04:51,508
Where you going? You're leaving?

77
00:04:51,678 --> 00:04:54,907
- No, no. I'm staying. I'm staying.
- Oh, my God, you're such a bad liar.

78
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,118
I know, but I try.

79
00:04:56,287 --> 00:04:58,741
You have to convince him
to come to one of these things.

80
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:01,179
He can't avoid us forever. Oh, my God.

81
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:03,678
- What are you doing here?
- Don't you love this woman?

82
00:05:03,838 --> 00:05:06,686
I could take her or leave her.
You guys...

83
00:05:06,847 --> 00:05:08,821
...this, when it starts, it's disgusting.

84
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:10,453
- We have to go.
- You're too happy.

85
00:05:10,623 --> 00:05:11,604
- Say goodbye.
- Bye.

86
00:05:11,774 --> 00:05:12,822
- I hate you.
- I love you.

87
00:05:12,991 --> 00:05:14,552
I really... I hate you so much.

88
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:22,423
Oh, God. It's so pretty out.

89
00:05:23,007 --> 00:05:25,179
Tell you what. I'll get him.
You sit here. Okay?

90
00:05:25,343 --> 00:05:27,319
No, let me get him.

91
00:05:27,487 --> 00:05:29,876
- Okay. Will you get me my jacket too?
- Fine.

92
00:05:30,048 --> 00:05:32,382
Here. Take this.

93
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,005
Thanks.

94
00:05:41,184 --> 00:05:42,461
Hey.

95
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:45,243
Oh, I can open my own door.

96
00:05:46,273 --> 00:05:47,734
Thank you.

97
00:05:58,529 --> 00:06:00,766
Good boy. Good boy.

98
00:06:02,082 --> 00:06:04,350
- Hi, puppy!
- Here.

99
00:06:06,274 --> 00:06:08,924
Are you gonna be that crabby
when you get older?

100
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:11,708
I am older. And I'm way meaner.

101
00:06:11,874 --> 00:06:14,873
Look, she gave me an apple. Here, baby.

102
00:06:17,763 --> 00:06:21,057
- So she is human.
- That was too big a bite.

103
00:06:21,475 --> 00:06:25,817
That was too big a bite.
I didn't say you could eat the whole thing.

104
00:06:25,987 --> 00:06:27,296
You know what?

105
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:32,761
I could get about maybe five days and we
could go to the place with the water and...

106
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:36,378
...find good food and lots of sleeping.

107
00:06:36,548 --> 00:06:38,336
Yes, I concur.

108
00:06:39,651 --> 00:06:40,928
Here, boy. Good boy.

109
00:06:43,587 --> 00:06:45,213
Good boy.

110
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,496
Don't give it to him. Throw it.

111
00:06:55,972 --> 00:06:59,420
- I wasn't mucking about, you know.
- What about?

112
00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:02,043
Why can't we go down
to city hall tonight?

113
00:07:02,436 --> 00:07:05,305
- Because it's closed.
- Tomorrow, then.

114
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:08,732
David, you have a family.
I don't, you know?

115
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:12,861
- You're not marrying my family.
- Well, I am, kind of.

116
00:07:13,382 --> 00:07:15,902
I mean, I hope I am.

117
00:07:18,373 --> 00:07:22,367
Your mom is so sweet and she just...
She wants the whole deal, you know?

118
00:07:22,532 --> 00:07:25,085
She wants the invitations...

119
00:07:25,253 --> 00:07:29,662
...and the band playing and the minister.

120
00:07:30,662 --> 00:07:33,826
I don't know. Maybe I do too,
you know? Because...

121
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,805
...it's not like I'm gonna do this twice.

122
00:07:38,023 --> 00:07:39,582
You're not?

123
00:07:40,934 --> 00:07:43,038
No, I'm not.

124
00:07:44,774 --> 00:07:47,556
That's the nicest thing
you ever said to me.

125
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:06,335
Where's Curtis?

126
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:08,257
Oi, Curtis!

127
00:08:08,423 --> 00:08:09,885
Come on, boy.

128
00:08:10,663 --> 00:08:12,933
Come on, pup! Did he go up there?

129
00:08:14,311 --> 00:08:16,254
- He's not in there, is he?
- Come on!

130
00:08:16,712 --> 00:08:18,337
Curtis?

131
00:08:20,487 --> 00:08:21,469
Hey!

132
00:08:22,537 --> 00:08:23,780
- There he is.
- Curtis.

133
00:08:29,224 --> 00:08:30,686
- Come on, boy.
- Curtis, come on.

134
00:08:33,961 --> 00:08:35,139
Hey, Curtis?

135
00:08:35,721 --> 00:08:38,372
- Hey.
- Curtis.

136
00:08:41,962 --> 00:08:43,336
Hey.

137
00:08:45,001 --> 00:08:48,034
- What's up, boy?
- What's wrong, sweetheart?

138
00:08:48,202 --> 00:08:49,445
Hey.

139
00:08:49,609 --> 00:08:51,944
Man, don't you know
there's a fucking leash law?

140
00:08:52,106 --> 00:08:54,277
Yeah, don't you fucking know better?

141
00:08:55,114 --> 00:08:57,382
Yeah. I'm sorry. Thanks for finding him.

142
00:08:57,898 --> 00:09:00,418
It's... It's all good, bro. It's all good.

143
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:02,688
But...

144
00:09:03,305 --> 00:09:05,411
...I get a reward or something?

145
00:09:09,931 --> 00:09:11,785
Our gratitude. Now give him to me.

146
00:09:11,946 --> 00:09:14,794
Come on, man. You know gratitude
ain't worth shit around here.

147
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:16,778
- You're hurting him!
- Give me the dog.

148
00:09:17,259 --> 00:09:21,000
No, I don't think so.
See, I kind of like this dog.

149
00:09:21,163 --> 00:09:23,585
I think he's a keeper. A keeper.

150
00:09:24,107 --> 00:09:25,700
Smile, baby.

151
00:09:32,748 --> 00:09:34,950
- You are a cunt.
- Fuck you, bitch!

152
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:39,109
Come on, motherfucker.
That's what I thought, you stupid pussy.

153
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,704
- Look...
- Go.

154
00:09:41,868 --> 00:09:44,258
I haven't got much money.
You can have what I've got.

155
00:09:44,428 --> 00:09:47,494
Give me your watch, give me your
ring. Let's go, I ain't got all day.

156
00:09:47,661 --> 00:09:49,121
Hurry the fuck up, princess.

157
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,813
- Let's go. Hurry up!
- Give him the shit.

158
00:09:51,981 --> 00:09:53,639
- Get the fuck over here.
- Fuck!

159
00:09:55,436 --> 00:09:58,218
- David!
- I fucking missed it!

160
00:09:58,413 --> 00:09:59,590
Where you going?

161
00:09:59,757 --> 00:10:02,059
- Action!
- Think you're fucking with me?!

162
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,331
You just made my day!

163
00:10:06,509 --> 00:10:08,003
Popped your motherfucking cherry!

164
00:10:09,486 --> 00:10:11,110
Let's even shit out.

165
00:10:11,917 --> 00:10:13,859
Ready for your close-up, cunt?!

166
00:10:14,029 --> 00:10:15,207
Heads up!

167
00:10:15,565 --> 00:10:16,548
Hollywood!

168
00:10:16,718 --> 00:10:18,660
Think you're fucking with me?!

169
00:10:21,646 --> 00:10:24,014
You ain't got nothing to say now, fool!

170
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:28,708
- David.
- Oh, how cute. Lovebirds.

171
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:31,944
- A chickenhead and a faggot.
- Say "cheese," bitch!

172
00:11:35,345 --> 00:11:36,807
This is the emergency room.

173
00:11:36,978 --> 00:11:39,662
- Did you get any sleep?
- No. Where's Murrow?

174
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:41,517
We're looking for him.

175
00:11:41,682 --> 00:11:44,879
She was dead on arrival
and her fingerprints are all over the gun.

176
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:46,992
- Where?
- Bedroom.

177
00:11:47,154 --> 00:11:48,910
Daughter called 911.

178
00:11:49,073 --> 00:11:51,792
Thanks. I wanna see her.

179
00:11:59,506 --> 00:12:02,823
- So he's laughing again.
- Yeah.

180
00:12:07,667 --> 00:12:10,896
Listen, the kid's in a waiting room
with ACS. I'll meet you over there.

181
00:12:17,683 --> 00:12:19,921
We need your signature right here.

182
00:12:22,836 --> 00:12:24,429
Where is she?

183
00:12:30,613 --> 00:12:33,929
- Can I talk to her?
- You can try.

184
00:12:36,085 --> 00:12:37,873
Hey, sweetie.

185
00:12:38,035 --> 00:12:40,175
Can I have a word with you?

186
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:45,873
We're just gonna be right here.
All right.

187
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:49,003
You like lollipops?

188
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:00,180
Pick one.

189
00:13:02,966 --> 00:13:05,388
That was the one I was gonna pick.

190
00:13:09,878 --> 00:13:11,701
You know, sweetie...

191
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:18,004
...something you should know. Your
mommy, she was really worried about you.

192
00:13:18,871 --> 00:13:23,824
And if she could, she would tell you
that you can trust me.

193
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,983
Did your stepfather hurt your mommy?

194
00:13:32,727 --> 00:13:34,156
Sean? Sean!

195
00:13:34,326 --> 00:13:35,756
Okay. Okay, step back!

196
00:13:35,928 --> 00:13:37,783
- I want my daughter!
- Get back!

197
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:40,432
All right! All right.

198
00:13:45,688 --> 00:13:47,150
You don't have the right.

199
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,709
- I do...
- At a time like this, I need to see her.

200
00:13:49,881 --> 00:13:51,855
No, you don't. I do have the right.

201
00:13:52,024 --> 00:13:54,513
- She is my daughter.
- No, she is your stepdaughter.

202
00:13:54,681 --> 00:13:56,591
And you know
how this whole thing works.

203
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,826
You done been through this a thousand
times. You hire your lawyers...

204
00:13:59,993 --> 00:14:02,807
...and you do your thing.
But right now, we're gonna do ours.

205
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:08,788
- I'm gonna take a walk. You deal with him.
- Yeah, I got it.

206
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:14,993
That was Dr. Sterling. Okay, bye-bye.

207
00:14:34,682 --> 00:14:36,624
It's a hell of a thing.

208
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:40,311
- Yup.
- I heard her show once.

209
00:15:21,277 --> 00:15:22,903
Erica?

210
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:27,314
Erica, can you hear me?

211
00:15:28,445 --> 00:15:30,201
Erica?

212
00:15:30,686 --> 00:15:32,758
You had the service?

213
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:35,830
They didn't know when
you were going to wake up...

214
00:15:35,997 --> 00:15:38,517
...if you were going to wake up.

215
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:41,558
You were gone for three weeks.

216
00:15:41,726 --> 00:15:45,075
We had to let him go. We had to.

217
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:46,968
I wanna see him again.

218
00:15:47,134 --> 00:15:48,727
- He's gone.
- I wanna see him again!

219
00:15:48,893 --> 00:15:51,131
He's gone, honey.

220
00:15:55,006 --> 00:15:57,942
He would have been happy
that you lived.

221
00:16:10,431 --> 00:16:14,141
<i>Nurse Bench, you have a call on one-four.</i>
<i>Nurse Bench.</i>

222
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:21,685
I don't know. All the faces
are starting to blur together. l...

223
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:23,547
I just can't tell anymore, you know?

224
00:16:23,711 --> 00:16:27,290
You gotta help us here. We need
something from you, anything.

225
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,006
Let's start over again.

226
00:16:30,175 --> 00:16:34,965
He hit your boyfriend with the pipe.
Once, twice, three times?

227
00:16:36,257 --> 00:16:37,598
We know how tough it can be...

228
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,477
...to go back there...
- Do you, huh?

229
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,623
Look, Miss Bain, we're on your side.

230
00:16:47,936 --> 00:16:49,431
Yeah.

231
00:16:49,729 --> 00:16:51,484
I know that.

232
00:16:52,353 --> 00:16:53,597
You're the good guys.

233
00:16:55,617 --> 00:16:57,593
So how come it doesn't feel like that?

234
00:21:09,741 --> 00:21:13,516
<i>Please leave a message for David and Erica</i>
<i>after the beep.</i>

235
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:17,321
<i>Hey, it's me. Call me at the gallery.</i>

236
00:21:17,486 --> 00:21:20,803

238
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:18,770
Ma'am, can I help you?

239
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:22,224
Detective O'Connor and Detective Pitney,
please.

240
00:23:22,387 --> 00:23:26,131
Pitney and O'Connor are out.
Can anyone else help you?

241
00:23:26,644 --> 00:23:28,334
Well...

242
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,737
...you know,
I wanted to check on my case.

243
00:23:30,901 --> 00:23:33,421
I've been calling and
we've been playing phone tag...

244
00:23:33,589 --> 00:23:35,760
...and I thought that if I came down...
- Okay.

245
00:23:35,924 --> 00:23:37,867
What kind of case did you have?

246
00:23:40,693 --> 00:23:42,700
My boyfriend was beaten to death.

247
00:23:42,869 --> 00:23:46,928
Oh, I'm sorry.
Do you have a complaint report number?

248
00:23:47,381 --> 00:23:49,967
- No, I don't know it.
- And what was his name?

249
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:52,845
David Kirmani.

250
00:23:53,653 --> 00:23:56,337
K-l-R-M-A-N-I.

251
00:23:57,622 --> 00:23:59,565
It might be under Erica Bain.

252
00:24:03,223 --> 00:24:05,295
About how long ago did it happen?

253
00:24:05,462 --> 00:24:06,892
June 11 th.

254
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:11,213
Okay. I realize how difficult
this can be...

255
00:24:11,382 --> 00:24:14,164
...but if you'd please be patient
and have a seat over there...

256
00:24:14,326 --> 00:24:16,661
...an officer will be down shortly
to help you.

257
00:24:16,823 --> 00:24:18,317
Okay.

258
00:24:40,024 --> 00:24:41,651
I realize how difficult it can be...

259
00:24:41,816 --> 00:24:44,598
...but if you'd please be patient
and have a seat over there...

260
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,608
...an officer will be down shortly
to help you.

261
00:25:13,402 --> 00:25:15,408
- Wanna get something to eat?
- What's up, guys?

262
00:25:15,578 --> 00:25:17,204
- Hey.
- You saw the game last night?

263
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:18,897
Man.

264
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:31,759
Could I help you?

265
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:37,074
Yeah. I wanna buy a gun.

266
00:25:37,242 --> 00:25:38,671
License?

267
00:25:38,907 --> 00:25:41,841
Oh, yeah, of course.
I need a license, yeah.

268
00:25:42,011 --> 00:25:46,266
Once you get one, fill out this form,
and we'll notify you in 30 days.

269
00:25:46,428 --> 00:25:48,021
I need to get something now.

270
00:25:48,188 --> 00:25:49,976
Sorry. That's illegal.

271
00:25:51,996 --> 00:25:53,304
Hey!

272
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,503
I won't survive 30 days.

273
00:26:05,852 --> 00:26:07,313
Hey.

274
00:26:07,484 --> 00:26:10,419
- What happened to you?
- Me? Nothing.

275
00:26:10,587 --> 00:26:12,377
A thousand dollars.

276
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,967
A thousand dollars?

277
00:26:15,133 --> 00:26:17,304
Okay, but I need to learn how to use it.

278
00:26:17,469 --> 00:26:20,339
No shit. Follow me.

279
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,696
Wait right here.

280
00:26:48,383 --> 00:26:49,909
In here.

281
00:26:52,446 --> 00:26:55,709
It's a Kahr K9.
Check to see if it's loaded.

282
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:57,048
How do I do that?

283
00:26:57,215 --> 00:27:00,062
The chamber. Pull the slide back.

284
00:27:00,223 --> 00:27:04,827
It's got internal safety so you don't
shoot yourself. Loads from the handle.

285
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:06,902
All right.

286
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:12,282
You pay me now, it's yours.

287
00:27:16,192 --> 00:27:18,231
I'll throw in the bullets.

288
00:27:23,489 --> 00:27:24,698
Yeah, I'll take it.

289
00:27:49,889 --> 00:27:51,613
Got it, got it, got it.

290
00:28:16,163 --> 00:28:20,025
You shouldn't smoke. It'll kill you.

291
00:28:20,643 --> 00:28:22,366
I don't care.

292
00:28:23,332 --> 00:28:25,851
There's plenty of ways to die.

293
00:28:27,843 --> 00:28:30,810
But you have to figure out a way to live.

294
00:28:30,978 --> 00:28:34,557
Now, that's hard.

295
00:28:52,036 --> 00:28:54,720
Look at you, all sophisticated.

296
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:59,997
- You shouldn't be working this late.
- I had a client dinner.

297
00:29:01,381 --> 00:29:03,453
Hey, can I get a dirty martini
for the lady?

298
00:29:03,621 --> 00:29:05,825
You said this was business, Sean.

299
00:29:06,565 --> 00:29:08,060
It is.

300
00:29:09,862 --> 00:29:11,716
Eighty-six that.

301
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:16,223
Okay, l...
I need a favor from you.

302
00:29:17,734 --> 00:29:19,196
You...

303
00:29:20,294 --> 00:29:23,871
- You heard about that Murrow thing, right?
- His wife killed herself.

304
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:27,044
Oh, come on. Women don't
shoot themselves in the face.

305
00:29:27,526 --> 00:29:29,763
At least in my experience.

306
00:29:29,926 --> 00:29:34,498
Where do they shoot themselves,
in your experience?

307
00:29:37,191 --> 00:29:38,369
The heart.

308
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,293
Jackie, I been...

309
00:29:47,688 --> 00:29:51,332
...chasing after this asshole
for three straight years.

310
00:29:51,496 --> 00:29:54,944
And right when his wife was ready
to turn state's evidence on him...

311
00:29:55,112 --> 00:29:59,781
...instead of blowing the lid off of him,
she blows off her own head.

312
00:29:59,944 --> 00:30:02,212
- Come on.
- You don't let go, do you?

313
00:30:07,336 --> 00:30:09,092
So what can I do?

314
00:30:12,361 --> 00:30:15,656
Well, she has a daughter.
Had a daughter.

315
00:30:15,817 --> 00:30:17,191
And...

316
00:30:18,281 --> 00:30:20,484
...her daughter knows something.

317
00:30:20,649 --> 00:30:23,747
But now he's asked for custody of her
and then he's gonna get it.

318
00:30:23,913 --> 00:30:26,281
- Is he the father?
- No, no. He's her stepfather.

319
00:30:26,441 --> 00:30:28,546
- And you want her made a ward of court.
- Yes.

320
00:30:28,713 --> 00:30:30,852
She knows something
and she's not safe with him.

321
00:30:31,016 --> 00:30:34,846
Look, all I'm asking you to do
is just act on her behalf.

322
00:30:35,017 --> 00:30:36,479
Please.

323
00:30:39,753 --> 00:30:41,575
Sean, I'm your ex-wife.

324
00:30:42,057 --> 00:30:43,814
Conflict of interest.

325
00:30:44,778 --> 00:30:46,884
And besides, I don't do pro bono.

326
00:30:51,401 --> 00:30:52,995
You used to.

327
00:30:53,706 --> 00:30:55,975
Yeah, well, I grew up.

328
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,283
When did you get out?!

329
00:31:29,453 --> 00:31:31,874
- You won't let me see my kids?
- You can't be here! Court order!

330
00:31:32,044 --> 00:31:34,762
- I'm calling 911!
- lf I can't see them, you won't see them!

331
00:31:39,885 --> 00:31:41,794
Try seeing them now.

332
00:31:45,773 --> 00:31:47,497
It's my money too.

333
00:32:36,175 --> 00:32:38,476
I can hear you breathing.

334
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,903
No.

335
00:34:23,637 --> 00:34:25,842
- Squad central.
- <i>Notify upon arrival.</i>

336
00:34:26,005 --> 00:34:28,493
- Damn.
- We're a 10-84 at 110 and Lenox.

337
00:34:28,661 --> 00:34:31,410
<i>10-4. Eighty-five to patrol supervisor</i>
<i>on the scene.</i>

338
00:34:31,574 --> 00:34:34,890
- 10-4.
- Looks like the circus made it to town.

339
00:35:04,471 --> 00:35:05,519
Any IDs?

340
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:08,304
Victim's a 30-year-old Vietnamese female.
Ida Combs.

341
00:35:10,872 --> 00:35:12,529
- Where's the other body?
- This way.

342
00:35:14,167 --> 00:35:17,845
Got a 39-year-old, Sandy Combs.
White male.

343
00:35:18,008 --> 00:35:21,969
Looks like he was a roadie for Aerosmith.
I don't think those guys have a dental plan.

344
00:35:22,136 --> 00:35:24,176
Guy had a rap sheet longer than my dick.

345
00:35:24,343 --> 00:35:26,896
So in other words, no priors.

346
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,974
Easy.

347
00:35:30,903 --> 00:35:35,727
So we got us a Sandy Combs and
an Ida Combs. What does that tell us?

348
00:35:35,897 --> 00:35:38,865
They're married.
I'm way ahead of you, pal.

349
00:35:39,033 --> 00:35:42,546
- Yeah, that's one way of ending it.
- You know, what's wrong with divorce?

350
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:44,627
Everything.

351
00:35:45,241 --> 00:35:47,280
Divorce sucks.

352
00:35:48,888 --> 00:35:50,133
Okay, so tell me.

353
00:35:50,296 --> 00:35:52,753
Well, she took three in the torso
with a.38.

354
00:35:52,922 --> 00:35:56,850
Then somebody smoked him with a 9 mm
automatic. Don't ask me who, though.

355
00:35:57,688 --> 00:35:59,926
And we found these casings.

356
00:36:01,881 --> 00:36:05,394
Three casings. Looks like there's
a partial print on one, but it's smudged.

357
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:07,224
Anybody check surveillance?

358
00:36:07,385 --> 00:36:10,069
That monitor's working,
but the machine's empty.

359
00:36:20,506 --> 00:36:22,328
Machine's working.

360
00:36:22,843 --> 00:36:24,501
- But where's the tape?
- Don't know.

361
00:36:30,171 --> 00:36:32,113
And why didn't he take the money?

362
00:36:32,284 --> 00:36:34,672
They chickened out, got scared?

363
00:36:37,147 --> 00:36:41,271
We got three casings, only one hit.
How about that?

364
00:36:41,436 --> 00:36:44,600
Maybe he's farsighted, crappy shooter.
Who knows?

365
00:36:44,764 --> 00:36:47,185
Or he never fired a gun before.

366
00:37:21,853 --> 00:37:23,544
<i>It is...</i>

New York, like any metropolis...

380
00:38:10,464 --> 00:38:15,167
New York, like any metropolis,
is an organism that changes, mutates.

381
00:38:15,327 --> 00:38:19,518
Building sprout-like chromosomes
on the DNA of its streets.

382
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,095
<i>New York, like any metropolis...</i>

Look, I've got... I've got two shows
that are almost finished.

386
00:39:03,714 --> 00:39:07,609
They're already mixed. All they need is an
intro and an outro, which I could do live.

387
00:39:07,874 --> 00:39:09,598
I've got six shows in various stages.

388
00:39:09,763 --> 00:39:14,748
I've got all these stories in my files.
You know, new stuff, better stuff.

389
00:39:15,106 --> 00:39:18,368
And I know what I'm doing,
and you know that I know what I'm doing.

390
00:39:18,531 --> 00:39:21,379
Erica. You've been through so much.

391
00:39:21,539 --> 00:39:23,874
You need more time before
you put yourself out there.

392
00:39:24,036 --> 00:39:26,272
- Don't make me beg.
- I don't mean to.

393
00:39:26,436 --> 00:39:29,370
But we have a public and I'm not sure
you're ready for it yet.

394
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:31,874
You telling me I can't work
because of what happened?

395
00:39:32,035 --> 00:39:34,272
I did not say that.

396
00:39:35,459 --> 00:39:37,052
Look...

397
00:39:38,628 --> 00:39:40,963
...I just need to keep living.

398
00:39:41,124 --> 00:39:43,393
You know, I don't wanna...

399
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,368

<i>Up next is</i> Street Walk.

402

Let's now join Erica Bain
in our WNKW studios.

403
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:08,131
Okay, Erica.
Three, two, one, you're on.

This is Erica Bain, and I walk the city.

Give me a minute, Carol.

410
00:40:40,551 --> 00:40:41,958
New York...

411
00:40:43,303 --> 00:40:45,639
...like any metropolis...

412
00:40:47,336 --> 00:40:48,830
...is...

413
00:40:59,337 --> 00:41:01,475
Oh, shit.

414
00:41:04,744 --> 00:41:06,686
New York...

415
00:41:08,073 --> 00:41:10,942
...the safest big city in the world.

416
00:41:13,192 --> 00:41:15,745
But it is horrible...

417
00:41:16,105 --> 00:41:18,855
...to fear the place you once loved.

418
00:41:20,265 --> 00:41:23,648
And to see a street corner
you knew so well...

419
00:41:24,138 --> 00:41:26,526
...and be afraid of its shadow.

420
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:29,381
To see familiar steps,
be unable to climb them.

421
00:41:31,722 --> 00:41:35,551
I never understood
how people lived with fear.

422
00:41:36,618 --> 00:41:39,268
Women afraid to walk home alone...

423
00:41:39,434 --> 00:41:41,573
...people afraid of...

424
00:41:41,834 --> 00:41:43,743
...white powder in their mailbox...

425
00:41:43,914 --> 00:41:47,297
...darkness and night.

426
00:41:47,946 --> 00:41:51,110
<i>People afraid of people.</i>

427
00:41:52,427 --> 00:41:55,810
I always believed that fear
belonged to other people.

428
00:41:56,907 --> 00:41:59,209
Weaker people.

429
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:03,524
It never touched me.

430
00:42:08,204 --> 00:42:10,211
And then it did.

431
00:42:13,579 --> 00:42:16,101
And when it touches you, you know...

432
00:42:16,268 --> 00:42:19,018
...that it's been there all along...

433
00:42:19,179 --> 00:42:23,687
...waiting beneath the surfaces
of everything you loved.

434
00:42:24,109 --> 00:42:27,938
And your skin crawls...

435
00:42:29,132 --> 00:42:30,660
...and your heart sickens...

436
00:42:30,829 --> 00:42:35,466
...and you look at the person you once were
walking down that street...

437
00:42:38,957 --> 00:42:41,161
...and you wonder, will you...?

438
00:42:42,989 --> 00:42:45,444
Will you ever be her again?

439
00:43:24,047 --> 00:43:25,870

think I'm playing, man.

443
00:44:04,754 --> 00:44:08,365
Don't nobody talk in New York no more?
I asked you a motherfucking question!

444
00:44:08,529 --> 00:44:10,950
I said, what are you listening to,
you fucking faggot?!

445
00:44:11,121 --> 00:44:12,648
- Radiohead, man.
- Radiohead?

446
00:44:12,818 --> 00:44:14,508
Leave him alone, man!

447
00:44:14,770 --> 00:44:16,396
Man, shut the fuck up!

448
00:44:16,562 --> 00:44:18,733
Little man, you ain't know
your pop sucked dick?

449
00:44:18,898 --> 00:44:22,194
He's good at it too. Now, you wanna
grow up to be like that punk ass?

450
00:44:22,354 --> 00:44:24,110
That's a nice watch.
How old are you?

451
00:44:24,275 --> 00:44:26,992
- Get your ass out of here.
- Tell your mom I said "What's up?"

452
00:44:27,155 --> 00:44:29,872
Yo, little man, holler at me,
I'll show you how to be a G.

453
00:44:30,035 --> 00:44:32,686
Hey, yo, thanks for the iPod, man.

454
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:36,302
This shit is nice, man.
This is all me right here.

455
00:44:36,466 --> 00:44:38,768
- I'm keeping this joint.
- You kidding me, right?

456
00:44:38,931 --> 00:44:40,623
This is cool.

457
00:44:44,659 --> 00:44:45,869
Oh, shit.

458
00:44:46,035 --> 00:44:49,865
- Yo, yo, yo, I got this, I got this.
- Bitch, is you crazy?

459
00:44:54,708 --> 00:44:56,081
This is too easy, man.

460
00:45:02,868 --> 00:45:04,112
So...

461
00:45:06,932 --> 00:45:09,354
...you gonna give me some Radiohead
too?

462
00:45:16,757 --> 00:45:19,059

00:46:17,175 --> 00:46:20,023
<i>Why doesn't somebody stop me?</i>

467
00:46:27,448 --> 00:46:29,456
I swear they like Oreos.

468
00:46:29,625 --> 00:46:30,998
Homicide, this is Vitale.

469
00:46:31,159 --> 00:46:33,495
There you go,
you're doing the tricks again.

470
00:46:33,657 --> 00:46:37,072
Upside down. No, come on up.
Gotta come to the top. There you go, baby.

471
00:46:37,241 --> 00:46:38,931
Okay, thank you.

472
00:46:39,193 --> 00:46:41,680
We've got two confirmed shot
on a subway from Brooklyn.

473
00:46:41,849 --> 00:46:45,013
Church Street, lower Manhattan.
Everyone's arguing whose jurisdiction.

474
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:47,414
- That makes it ours.
- All right, fellas, let's go.

475
00:47:29,308 --> 00:47:32,821
We got two dead bodies inside
the subway car, and no eyewitnesses.

476
00:47:32,988 --> 00:47:35,027
Of course not.
Did you check with BCI?

477
00:47:35,195 --> 00:47:36,373
Yeah, I got this printout.

478
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:37,969
- They here yet?
- Yes, sir.

479
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:40,442
- And I'll get them to you.
- Morning, fellas.

480
00:47:43,005 --> 00:47:45,176
Christ on a cracker.

481
00:47:45,756 --> 00:47:49,334
Well, I hope this is their stop.

482
00:47:51,741 --> 00:47:54,806
Got Radiohead, U2, Dixie Chicks.

483
00:47:54,972 --> 00:47:57,691
- No Wu-Tang?
- I don't think this is his.

484
00:48:03,197 --> 00:48:04,954
Money in his pocket.

485
00:48:14,782 --> 00:48:17,433
Looks like a 9 mm automatic.

486
00:48:19,070 --> 00:48:21,371
- Like from the other night?
- Yeah.

487
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:25,686
Check it against Brass Catchers,
see if it matches.

488
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:40,245
Hey, you.

489
00:48:42,623 --> 00:48:46,071
- just go inside. I came out here for
a smoke. I just wanna go back in.

490
00:48:46,239 --> 00:48:49,785
You're giving me a hard time.
You let my friends in.

491
00:49:01,824 --> 00:49:06,429
They both had cash, so neither one of them
was robbed. And they had priors.

492
00:49:06,591 --> 00:49:08,502
A shitload of them.

493
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,736
The guy at Sandy's, he had priors.

494
00:49:11,904 --> 00:49:13,595
I know, but that was domestic.

495
00:49:13,761 --> 00:49:16,062
No, but he wasn't robbed.

496
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,394
Or something.

497
00:49:19,232 --> 00:49:22,614
- I mean, what are we missing?
- I wish I knew.

498
00:49:23,424 --> 00:49:26,272
Now, look. You got a small guy sitting.

499
00:49:26,433 --> 00:49:29,052
These two punks come at him with a knife
and, you know...

500
00:49:29,218 --> 00:49:31,803
...he shoots the first one without
getting out of his seat.

501
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:33,430
Right. Go on, I'm with you.

502
00:49:33,602 --> 00:49:37,344
It's like maybe Mr. Average Joe just
decided, "I'm not gonna take it anymore.

503
00:49:37,602 --> 00:49:39,707
And I'm gonna take matters
into my own hands."

504
00:49:39,874 --> 00:49:41,881
The kind of guy
you wouldn't even notice.

505
00:49:42,050 --> 00:49:44,734
Well, if that's true, he's getting better.

506
00:49:45,026 --> 00:49:47,676
Yeah. Every bullet hit home.

507
00:49:58,178 --> 00:49:59,454
- Detective!
- Hey, detective!

508
00:49:59,619 --> 00:50:03,099
- Detective!
- Any leads, detective? Please.

509
00:50:04,163 --> 00:50:07,392
- Come on, step back!
- What about the bodies, detective?

510
00:50:07,555 --> 00:50:09,977
It's a new... It's a new investigation.

511
00:50:10,147 --> 00:50:12,056
We haven't talked to anybody yet, no.

512
00:50:12,771 --> 00:50:14,397
It's a brand-new investigation.

513
00:50:14,564 --> 00:50:17,946
- Any suspects?
- No, we're not... I'm sorry, but we're not...

514
00:50:19,235 --> 00:50:21,091
Any leads? How many?

515
00:50:21,252 --> 00:50:22,778
Detective!

516
00:50:23,491 --> 00:50:24,833
Hey.

517
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:26,911
Excuse me, don't I know you?

518
00:50:27,077 --> 00:50:29,597
- No, I don't think we've met.
- Wait a minute. I know you.

519
00:50:29,763 --> 00:50:31,586
- No. You haven't. l...
- What's your name?

520
00:50:31,748 --> 00:50:34,301
My name's Erica Bain.
I do a radio show.

521
00:50:34,468 --> 00:50:37,763
I don't know if you'd be interested in doing
an interview. I'd love to...

522
00:50:37,924 --> 00:50:40,030
I'm sorry.
We're not talking to the media now.

523
00:50:40,196 --> 00:50:42,618
I'm not that kind of media.
It would be about you.

524
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:44,349
My life's not that interesting.

525
00:50:45,605 --> 00:50:48,474
- Yeah, but the work you do is.
- No, thank you.

526
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:03,332
<i>So...</i>

527
00:51:03,911 --> 00:51:06,627
<i>... you gonna give me some Radiohead</i>
<i>too?</i>

528
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:14,722
<i>You ever been fucked by a knife?</i>

529
00:51:27,014 --> 00:51:28,803
How the hell did this get out so quick?

530
00:51:28,968 --> 00:51:33,277
Who knows? Coroner hates you,
people fucking technicians. Who knows?

531
00:51:33,991 --> 00:51:35,901
"Bloodbath."

532
00:51:37,062 --> 00:51:39,267
You ever listen to NKW?

533
00:51:39,432 --> 00:51:40,925
- What is that, like hip-hop?
- No.

534
00:51:42,888 --> 00:51:44,927
Remember a couple of months ago...

535
00:51:45,095 --> 00:51:47,943
...this girl and her boyfriend,
they got jacked in Central Park?

536
00:51:48,392 --> 00:51:51,938
- No. Which ones?
- Well, anyway, she has this radio show.

537
00:51:52,104 --> 00:51:54,886
- Right.
- She shows up at the subway last night...

538
00:51:55,049 --> 00:51:57,350
...and guess who she wants to interview?
- Me?

539
00:51:58,473 --> 00:52:02,215
What, you? You should totally do it.
Remember that Bernie Goetz thing?

540
00:52:02,376 --> 00:52:03,358
Hey, is Carter in?

541
00:52:03,529 --> 00:52:06,147
Reporters calling in the night.
Reporters eat that shit up.

542
00:52:06,313 --> 00:52:09,729
No, well, she's not that kind of reporter.
Yeah, well, have him call me.

543
00:52:09,898 --> 00:52:11,522
What is she?
Like a DJ or something?

544
00:52:11,689 --> 00:52:14,078
- No, she's just interesting, you know.
- Interesting?

545
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:16,072
Have him call me at my desk.
It's Mercer.

546
00:52:16,233 --> 00:52:18,208
What's she want with you?
Give her my number.

547
00:52:18,505 --> 00:52:20,807
What's her precise street address?

548
00:52:20,970 --> 00:52:22,311
You know what I want?

549
00:52:22,474 --> 00:52:24,547
I want everyone in the market
that night...

550
00:52:24,713 --> 00:52:28,358
...everyone on the subway, outside.
Everybody, I need them all brought in.

551
00:52:28,522 --> 00:52:30,758
Somebody has to have seen this guy.

552
00:52:30,922 --> 00:52:33,224
I need you to get the registration
off of this iPod.

553
00:52:33,834 --> 00:52:35,777
- See who it belongs to.
- I'm on it.

554
00:52:40,714 --> 00:52:42,341
You've been avoiding me.

555
00:52:42,507 --> 00:52:43,935
- No, I haven't.
- Yeah.

556
00:52:44,106 --> 00:52:47,402
You've been avoiding
the full glare of my disapproval.

557
00:52:47,562 --> 00:52:51,872
Yeah, well, it was... The show sucked
and everybody hated it. I'm sorry.

558
00:52:52,044 --> 00:52:55,272
Well, we don't normally do silence
on WNKW.

559
00:52:55,435 --> 00:52:57,474
You almost managed a full minute.

560
00:52:57,643 --> 00:52:59,749
Well, I think I did
an okay recovery, so...

561
00:52:59,916 --> 00:53:04,225
You got 11 more steps, do you?
Are they all gonna be on the air?

562
00:53:07,627 --> 00:53:12,167
I thought we were better than
some AM confessional...

563
00:53:12,332 --> 00:53:13,739
...but people are responding.

564
00:53:14,509 --> 00:53:18,785
I was wrong.
I'm big enough to admit it, so keep it up.

565
00:53:41,198 --> 00:53:42,856
Erica Bain?

566
00:53:44,494 --> 00:53:46,120
Erica Bain.

567
00:53:47,053 --> 00:53:49,291
I'm Detective Mercer. You...

568
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:53,673
You remember me from last night?

569
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:57,674
- Yeah.
- Yeah, well...

570
00:53:58,158 --> 00:54:01,901
...I saw you in the hospital after...

571
00:54:02,255 --> 00:54:05,156
After what had happened
to you and to your friend.

572
00:54:07,182 --> 00:54:08,230
My friend?

573
00:54:08,398 --> 00:54:12,075
Yeah. I stopped by your room, you know,
because I recognized your name.

574
00:54:12,239 --> 00:54:16,233
My wife, she used to listen to your show
all the time and...

575
00:54:16,527 --> 00:54:20,238
...that was why I stopped you
in the subway.

576
00:54:20,464 --> 00:54:21,990
I just wanted you to know that.

577
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:25,927
Thank you.

578
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:32,327
You know, it was disturbing.

579
00:54:33,424 --> 00:54:36,326
It really was. I mean, you were gone.

580
00:54:37,456 --> 00:54:40,390
And to see somebody...

581
00:54:40,721 --> 00:54:43,109
...that can't see you, it...

582
00:54:43,953 --> 00:54:45,513
But you're back now.

583
00:54:46,641 --> 00:54:48,910
Yeah, I'm back now.

584
00:54:49,073 --> 00:54:51,407
A lot of people don't make it back.

585
00:54:52,657 --> 00:54:54,250
I know that.

586
00:54:55,217 --> 00:54:58,446
I know you do. You see...

587
00:54:59,089 --> 00:55:00,397
...I checked into your case.

588
00:55:00,561 --> 00:55:03,725
- You checked into my case?
- Yeah.

589
00:55:04,114 --> 00:55:07,462
We got two of the best detectives
in this city that's working on this...

590
00:55:07,633 --> 00:55:09,739
...and we will find them.

591
00:55:09,906 --> 00:55:11,214
We always do.

592
00:55:13,298 --> 00:55:16,080
Are policemen always so confident?

593
00:55:17,138 --> 00:55:18,632
Are you interviewing me now?

594
00:55:20,723 --> 00:55:23,057
- Yeah, I guess I am.
- Right.

595
00:55:23,954 --> 00:55:25,001
Okay.

596
00:55:25,906 --> 00:55:28,394
How long is this gonna take?

597
00:55:28,562 --> 00:55:32,141
Five minutes, tops.
We can do it over here.

598
00:55:34,644 --> 00:55:35,919
Yeah.

599
00:55:38,643 --> 00:55:41,643
When you first go to a crime scene...

600
00:55:41,844 --> 00:55:45,040
...what do you look for?
- Evidence.

601
00:55:45,523 --> 00:55:47,247
Okay, such as?

602
00:55:47,412 --> 00:55:49,300
Murder weapon, entry wound...

603
00:55:49,459 --> 00:55:52,972
...DNA samples, prints,
carbon fragments...

604
00:55:53,139 --> 00:55:54,864
...position of the corpse.

605
00:55:55,028 --> 00:55:57,810
It's amazing what a dead body
can tell you.

606
00:55:58,196 --> 00:55:59,920
So the dead do talk?

607
00:56:00,083 --> 00:56:02,386
Oh, yeah. Everybody talks.

608
00:56:02,548 --> 00:56:06,738
Now, most everybody lies.
But the dead can't.

609
00:56:07,124 --> 00:56:10,986
And then again, the lies
tell you things too, because...

610
00:56:11,284 --> 00:56:13,521
...people tell them for a reason.

611
00:56:14,132 --> 00:56:17,994
And those bodies at the subway,
what are they telling you?

612
00:56:18,516 --> 00:56:20,372
You read the paper.

613
00:56:20,661 --> 00:56:22,516
Should I believe what I read?

614
00:56:27,766 --> 00:56:29,871
You ever read about him?

615
00:56:32,502 --> 00:56:33,747
Why do I know him?

616
00:56:33,910 --> 00:56:37,172
That's Mr. Murrow. He owns the parking
out on Roosevelt Island.

617
00:56:38,070 --> 00:56:40,175
But that's not all he does.

618
00:56:40,535 --> 00:56:42,096
What else does he do?

619
00:56:45,207 --> 00:56:47,727
- You really wanna know?
- Yeah.

620
00:56:48,055 --> 00:56:49,396
Then this is off the record.

621
00:56:50,583 --> 00:56:51,925
Okay.

622
00:56:56,279 --> 00:57:00,403
He imports drugs, guns, people.
Whatever's in demand.

623
00:57:00,566 --> 00:57:02,422
Found three guys that had crossed him...

624
00:57:02,584 --> 00:57:06,708
...with their hands Superglued to a table
and expanding cement in their throats.

625
00:57:06,870 --> 00:57:08,846
Had his wife ready
to testify against him...

626
00:57:09,016 --> 00:57:11,983
...and then she's found with her brains
blown out, gun in her hand.

627
00:57:12,152 --> 00:57:14,192
Nothing adds up except his lawyers.

628
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:16,302
Now he's got custody
of his stepdaughter...

629
00:57:16,472 --> 00:57:18,708
...and not for sentimental reasons.

630
00:57:18,872 --> 00:57:21,206
But he knows she knows something...

631
00:57:21,368 --> 00:57:24,085
...and I hate to think what's
gonna happen to her. But...

632
00:57:24,951 --> 00:57:27,091
...maybe you know a nicer side.

633
00:57:31,608 --> 00:57:33,497
And why can't you nail him?

634
00:57:34,872 --> 00:57:36,400
Because I follow the law.

635
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:38,929
Well, there's nothing you can do?

636
00:57:39,545 --> 00:57:41,171
Nothing that's legal.

637
00:57:44,089 --> 00:57:45,715
I didn't say that.

638
00:57:46,265 --> 00:57:47,924
I didn't hear it.

639
00:57:53,081 --> 00:57:54,064
Thank you.

640
00:57:54,394 --> 00:57:56,248
<i>Nothing that's legal.</i>

641
00:57:59,993 --> 00:58:00,976
So...

642
00:58:01,402 --> 00:58:03,507
...there's nothing you can do?

643
00:58:04,186 --> 00:58:07,448
No. No matter how bad I feel about it.

644
00:58:08,058 --> 00:58:11,157
I petitioned that she be made
a ward of the court...

645
00:58:11,323 --> 00:58:15,152
...but his lawyers killed that one
stone dead, so...

646
00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:19,095
Ever shot anyone?

647
00:58:21,531 --> 00:58:22,938
Yeah.

648
00:58:23,964 --> 00:58:25,873
Did your hands shake?

649
00:58:28,603 --> 00:58:30,033
No.

650
00:58:30,748 --> 00:58:34,393
But that's one of the benefits
of being on the right side.

651
00:58:34,556 --> 00:58:40,055
A benefit that that asshole and
the subway shooter don't have.

652
00:58:40,476 --> 00:58:42,331
And you think they're the same?

653
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:46,523
They both walked away from a murder,
didn't they?

654
00:58:48,061 --> 00:58:49,305
Let me ask you a question.

655
00:58:50,428 --> 00:58:52,022
Just us.

656
00:58:55,230 --> 00:58:57,203
How did you...

657
00:58:59,165 --> 00:59:01,718
...pull it back together
after what happened to you?

658
00:59:04,830 --> 00:59:06,356
You don't.

659
00:59:07,165 --> 00:59:08,726
I'm sorry.

660
00:59:08,893 --> 00:59:10,387
- No, no.
- Jacked-up question, man.

661
00:59:10,556 --> 00:59:13,046
It's a fair question. You...

662
00:59:15,390 --> 00:59:17,299
You become someone else.

663
00:59:21,822 --> 00:59:23,612
A stranger.

664
00:59:31,230 --> 00:59:33,718
You must have loved him very much.

665
00:59:33,887 --> 00:59:35,293
Yeah.

666
00:59:37,184 --> 00:59:42,584
Sometimes that just makes it harder,
you know. You just wish you didn't.

667
00:59:43,711 --> 00:59:47,191
So, come on, some more cop stuff.

668
00:59:47,455 --> 00:59:50,173
- Or are we done?
- No, l... We're good.

669
00:59:51,712 --> 00:59:53,238
Thanks.

670
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:56,472
And... here.

671
00:59:56,639 --> 00:59:58,614
That's my card. You...

672
00:59:58,944 --> 01:00:02,360
You wanna talk about your case,
you can call me. Any time.

673
01:00:03,456 --> 01:00:05,083
I warn you...

674
01:00:05,344 --> 01:00:06,620
...I don't sleep.

675
01:00:08,833 --> 01:00:10,523
Neither do I.

676
01:00:35,970 --> 01:00:38,457
<i>I walk the streets at night now.</i>

677
01:00:38,978 --> 01:00:42,753
<i>I find places and things</i>
<i>I never knew existed.</i>

678
01:00:43,074 --> 01:00:47,450
<i>But am I finding them</i>
<i>or are they finding me?</i>

679
01:00:51,139 --> 01:00:52,283
<i>Ever shot anyone?</i>

680
01:00:53,603 --> 01:00:55,130
<i>Yes.</i>

681
01:00:55,490 --> 01:00:57,531
<i>Did your hands shake?</i>

682
01:00:59,843 --> 01:01:05,081
<i>No, that's one of the benefits</i>
<i>of being on the right side.</i>

683
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:10,046
<i>That from a police detective covering</i>
<i>last night's subway shooting.</i>

684
01:01:10,211 --> 01:01:14,008
<i>And like all good cops,</i>
<i>he believes in the law...</i>

685
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:18,620
<i>... in right and wrong,</i>
<i>and the thin, fragile line between them.</i>

686
01:01:20,291 --> 01:01:23,608
<i>And he's probably wondering,</i>
<i>as I speak...</i>

687
01:01:24,419 --> 01:01:26,842
<i>... why is somebody</i>
<i>doing his job for him?</i>

688
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:40,863
Hey, baby.

689
01:01:42,342 --> 01:01:45,375
- Hello.
- What's up, honey?

690
01:01:45,573 --> 01:01:47,003
Not much.

691
01:01:47,238 --> 01:01:50,435
So, what would 50 dollars do for you?

692
01:01:53,317 --> 01:01:55,738
- Shouldn't she be at home?
- She got no home.

693
01:01:55,910 --> 01:01:57,819
Have you, honey?

694
01:02:00,614 --> 01:02:03,581
- Where to?
- Come on in.

695
01:02:06,790 --> 01:02:10,336
- You're looking for a show in the back seat?
- Oh, yeah.

696
01:02:16,295 --> 01:02:17,440
What's your name, honey?

697
01:02:19,815 --> 01:02:20,796
Chloe.

698
01:02:22,087 --> 01:02:24,804
What's he got in mind, Chloe?

699
01:02:25,703 --> 01:02:28,158
The little whore needs a mommy.

700
01:02:29,224 --> 01:02:31,166
Are you a mommy?

701
01:02:32,616 --> 01:02:34,623
You're a whore, right?

702
01:02:34,824 --> 01:02:36,711
I'm collecting whores.

703
01:02:36,872 --> 01:02:38,878
You know them suicide bombers
over in Iraq?

704
01:02:39,048 --> 01:02:41,862
When they die they want 72 virgins.
Me, I want whores.

705
01:02:42,375 --> 01:02:43,750
I want them while I'm alive.

706
01:02:43,913 --> 01:02:47,524
You know, Chloe and I
are gonna take a little walk.

707
01:02:50,473 --> 01:02:54,728
- You ain't going nowhere.
- Never get in the car.

708
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:57,575
How long have you been in it?

709
01:02:58,536 --> 01:02:59,944
Four...

710
01:03:01,481 --> 01:03:04,864
...five, six days.

711
01:03:05,193 --> 01:03:06,753
Since...

712
01:03:07,849 --> 01:03:10,052
Since Vegas.

713
01:03:11,274 --> 01:03:14,273
But you wanna go now, don't you?

714
01:03:15,114 --> 01:03:16,357
Yes.

715
01:03:16,617 --> 01:03:19,336
Are you giving me grief again?

716
01:03:19,497 --> 01:03:22,368
Oh, my, got us a supercunt here.

717
01:03:22,602 --> 01:03:24,706
Open the doors.

718
01:03:25,002 --> 01:03:26,528
And if I don't?

719
01:03:26,697 --> 01:03:29,545
Then I'll be the last supercunt
you'll ever see.

720
01:03:32,362 --> 01:03:33,889
Get out of the car, Chloe. Go on.

721
01:03:34,442 --> 01:03:36,298
Not until he pays me.

722
01:03:36,587 --> 01:03:38,409
All right, pay the girl.

723
01:03:38,955 --> 01:03:41,737
Come on! Easy.

724
01:03:48,010 --> 01:03:49,058
All of it.

725
01:03:52,011 --> 01:03:53,440
All of it!

726
01:04:07,276 --> 01:04:09,130
Come on, walk.

727
01:04:09,292 --> 01:04:12,772
Don't turn around. Just keep going.

728
01:04:13,964 --> 01:04:16,998
You got a family back there, Chloe,
in Vegas?

729
01:04:17,165 --> 01:04:20,165
No. I went there from Albuquerque.

730
01:04:20,333 --> 01:04:22,667
Well, you got enough money
to get you home now.

731
01:04:26,861 --> 01:04:28,323
Ain't you a sad whore?

732
01:04:28,814 --> 01:04:29,796
Get out of the way!

733
01:04:42,638 --> 01:04:44,066
Hey. Hey!

734
01:04:44,237 --> 01:04:46,988
You're okay. You're okay, come on.

735
01:04:47,279 --> 01:04:49,220
Let me turn you over.

736
01:04:49,390 --> 01:04:52,968
All right. I'm so sorry. Here.

737
01:04:55,726 --> 01:04:57,287
Is this...

738
01:04:57,647 --> 01:04:58,988
...still America?

739
01:04:59,150 --> 01:05:01,192
Yeah. Your leg is broken.

740
01:05:03,631 --> 01:05:05,834
Who the hell are you?

741
01:05:06,542 --> 01:05:08,365
I'm nobody.

742
01:05:16,464 --> 01:05:17,707
<i>There is no going back...</i>

743
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:20,428
<i>... to that other.</i>

744
01:05:20,687 --> 01:05:22,596
<i>She is gone.</i>

745
01:05:22,831 --> 01:05:26,410
<i>This thing, this stranger...</i>

746
01:05:26,768 --> 01:05:28,873
<i>... it's all you are now.</i>

747
01:05:35,088 --> 01:05:36,943
You walking out the heat?

748
01:05:37,103 --> 01:05:38,381
Yeah.

749
01:05:39,569 --> 01:05:41,096
Are you all right?

750
01:05:41,712 --> 01:05:43,274
Your hands are cold as ice.

751
01:05:45,649 --> 01:05:48,202
Your lipstick is smudged.

752
01:05:51,793 --> 01:05:53,998
Erica. Erica!

753
01:05:57,650 --> 01:05:59,592
You never said my name before.

754
01:05:59,762 --> 01:06:01,169
I heard your show.

755
01:06:01,554 --> 01:06:03,497
Right and wrong?

756
01:06:07,954 --> 01:06:10,507
Ballistic tests have linked
last night's shooting...

757
01:06:10,675 --> 01:06:14,089
...with the shooting from the market
and the shooting from the subway, so...

758
01:06:14,258 --> 01:06:17,837
Are you saying...? Are you saying the
same gun was used in all three shootings?

759
01:06:18,003 --> 01:06:19,529
Well, that seems to be the case.

760
01:06:19,858 --> 01:06:21,003
Detective.

761
01:06:21,170 --> 01:06:23,920
Sources are saying the witness
can provide a description...

762
01:06:24,083 --> 01:06:26,985
...but has refused to talk.
- I'm sorry, can you repeat that?

763
01:06:27,155 --> 01:06:30,189
Has the witness refused
to provide a description?

764
01:06:31,923 --> 01:06:34,029
No, the witness is awake...

765
01:06:34,196 --> 01:06:38,090
...and she is coherent, and we will be
interviewing her shortly.

766
01:06:40,148 --> 01:06:42,636
Now, thank you, that's everything.
Chief.

767
01:06:43,252 --> 01:06:44,778
Please, everybody, please.

768
01:06:44,948 --> 01:06:47,631
That's all the information
we're prepared to release.

769
01:06:47,795 --> 01:06:49,487
Thank you very much.

770
01:06:55,988 --> 01:06:57,298
Hey.

771
01:06:58,549 --> 01:07:02,029
- You handled yourself really well back there.
- I tried.

772
01:07:02,196 --> 01:07:05,579
So, what, is this guy
becoming an obsession with you?

773
01:07:05,845 --> 01:07:08,299
No, my interest is in you.

774
01:07:09,205 --> 01:07:10,700
Why me?

775
01:07:11,158 --> 01:07:16,275
Well, because you seem like a good man,
you know? Like a good cop.

776
01:07:17,238 --> 01:07:20,107
Yeah, well, ain't nobody
doing my job for me.

777
01:07:20,341 --> 01:07:21,836
You heard my show.

778
01:07:22,229 --> 01:07:23,659
Yeah.

779
01:07:23,829 --> 01:07:26,480
You gotta think every one of those
reporters in that room...

780
01:07:26,646 --> 01:07:29,135
...is gonna sensationalize this.

781
01:07:29,685 --> 01:07:30,896
But not you.

782
01:07:31,319 --> 01:07:33,205
You're better than that.

783
01:07:34,935 --> 01:07:36,080
How can you tell?

784
01:07:38,295 --> 01:07:39,472
Your show.

785
01:07:39,639 --> 01:07:42,355
- My show?
- Yeah.

786
01:07:43,127 --> 01:07:45,232
You see, my wife...

787
01:07:45,431 --> 01:07:47,536
...she didn't listen to it.
- No?

788
01:07:47,702 --> 01:07:48,913
I did.

789
01:07:51,287 --> 01:07:53,590
Well, you don't fit our audience profile.

790
01:07:53,752 --> 01:07:56,403
- Yeah, and you don't fit your voice either.
- I don't?

791
01:07:57,399 --> 01:08:01,807
No, you're a whole lot cuter
and about 100 pounds lighter.

792
01:08:05,559 --> 01:08:06,705
How's the girl doing?

793
01:08:08,504 --> 01:08:12,148
She's pretty banged up.
Yeah, but we'll know more tomorrow.

794
01:08:13,689 --> 01:08:15,215
Well...

795
01:08:16,952 --> 01:08:18,894
I hope she's all right.

796
01:08:19,128 --> 01:08:20,470
Yeah.

797
01:08:31,961 --> 01:08:33,620
- Hi.
- Hey.

798
01:08:35,258 --> 01:08:37,145
You see those pictures
of the subway thing?

799
01:08:37,305 --> 01:08:39,128
- Gross.
- They shot another one last night.

800
01:08:39,290 --> 01:08:41,973
- Some pervert.
- Who will they go for next, Donald Trump?

801
01:08:42,138 --> 01:08:44,505
- No, that's incitement.
- And justified.

802
01:08:44,666 --> 01:08:47,283
- Wish he'd take care of my ex.
- You think that's funny?

803
01:08:47,450 --> 01:08:49,938
I suppose you think
lethal injection's funny too.

804
01:08:50,106 --> 01:08:53,107
- Funny like strange, or funny "ha, ha"?
- You're sick, you know that?

805
01:08:53,275 --> 01:08:55,161
You're all sick.

806
01:09:01,914 --> 01:09:06,038
I'm thinking about opening up your show.
I want you to take phone-ins.

807
01:09:06,203 --> 01:09:09,170
- On what?
- You heard them.

808
01:09:09,403 --> 01:09:12,437
You mean the shootings?
The vigilante thing?

809
01:09:12,603 --> 01:09:15,670
- You really think that that's appropriate?
- Why not?

810
01:09:15,836 --> 01:09:18,738
Well, I thought you said
you didn't like that kind of thing.

811
01:09:18,907 --> 01:09:21,875
I don't. But you're good at it.

812
01:09:22,171 --> 01:09:25,553
- How am I good at it?
- You're a survivor.

813
01:09:25,723 --> 01:09:28,474
- I'm not asking you to personalize it.
- Oh, you're not?

814
01:09:28,636 --> 01:09:30,840
No more than you already have.

815
01:09:32,252 --> 01:09:35,220
<i>" The essential American soul is hard...</i>

816
01:09:35,645 --> 01:09:39,191
...isolate, stoic, and a killer.

817
01:09:39,356 --> 01:09:41,560
It has never yet melted."

818
01:09:42,014 --> 01:09:43,900
I quote that from D.H. Lawrence...

819
01:09:44,061 --> 01:09:47,322
...because someone
is playing God out there...

820
01:09:47,485 --> 01:09:50,354
...killing in the name of justice,
in this...

821
01:09:50,524 --> 01:09:53,078
...the safest big city in the world.

822
01:09:53,245 --> 01:09:57,915
And because I've been asked today to do
something that we've never done before:

823
01:09:58,077 --> 01:10:00,118
Take calls from our listeners
on the subject.

824
01:10:00,286 --> 01:10:02,936
This is a new departure for us but
we wanna hear from you...

825
01:10:03,102 --> 01:10:08,219
...so call 212-165-9990.

826
01:10:09,086 --> 01:10:11,093
First caller. Hi, you're on the air.

827
01:10:11,261 --> 01:10:14,110
<i>As far as I'm concerned,</i>
<i>he's doing us a favor.</i>

828
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:15,252
And why is that?

829
01:10:15,421 --> 01:10:17,331
<i>Because no matter what</i>
<i>the media tells us...</i>

830
01:10:17,502 --> 01:10:19,958
<i>... crimes are being committed,</i>
<i>and he's cleaning it up.</i>

831
01:10:20,126 --> 01:10:21,981
And you think
he has the right to do that.

832
01:10:22,142 --> 01:10:24,314
- <i>Well, yeah.</i>
- Next caller. You're on the air.

833
01:10:24,704 --> 01:10:26,492
<i>You're talking about murder.</i>

834
01:10:26,655 --> 01:10:28,378
<i>The death penalty without a trial.</i>

835
01:10:28,543 --> 01:10:31,839
<i>The vigilante is just like the people</i>
<i>he's killing. He should be in jail.</i>

836
01:10:31,998 --> 01:10:34,749
Well, maybe he will. Next caller.
You're on the air.

837
01:10:34,911 --> 01:10:37,464
<i>It's less about what he's doing</i>
<i>than how it makes us feel.</i>

838
01:10:37,631 --> 01:10:38,974
<i>There's not a person I know...</i>

839
01:10:39,135 --> 01:10:41,307
<i>... doesn't get a jolt of</i>
<i>pleasure when they hear</i>...

840
01:10:41,471 --> 01:10:43,708
- <i>Pleasure?</i>
- <i>Yeah, revenge makes us feel good.</i>

841
01:10:43,872 --> 01:10:46,043
<i>That's why we have war,</i>
<i>why we got the death</i>...

842
01:10:46,207 --> 01:10:49,241
- <i>Next caller, you're on the air.</i>
- <i>I think it's good for New York.</i>

843
01:10:49,409 --> 01:10:51,644
<i>I mean, this city</i>
<i>was turning into Disneyland.</i>

844
01:10:51,808 --> 01:10:54,907
- <i>We're getting our street cred back.</i>
- <i>Next caller. You're on the air.</i>

845
01:10:55,136 --> 01:10:59,064
<i>What is wrong with our society, that this</i>
<i>kind of thing can even get on radio?</i>

846
01:10:59,232 --> 01:11:02,101
<i>Revenge, murder, vigilante killings?</i>

847
01:11:02,273 --> 01:11:04,956
<i>Hasn't the whole Iraqi debacle</i>
<i>taught us anything?</i>

848
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:06,747
<i>"Waste the bad guys, bring them on."</i>

849
01:11:06,912 --> 01:11:09,367
<i>I've been a fan of yours.</i>
<i>I can't even believe you're</i>...

850
01:11:09,537 --> 01:11:11,194
Neither can I. You're on the air.

851
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:14,972
<i>I wonder if the vigilante has a girlfriend</i>
<i>because there's something sexy about</i>...

852
01:11:15,138 --> 01:11:16,829
- Sexy?
- <i>Yeah, completely.</i>

853
01:11:16,993 --> 01:11:19,328
<i>And if he's listening, my number is 2</i>...

854
01:11:19,489 --> 01:11:22,042
- You're on the line.
- <i>This is the vigilante calling.</i>

855
01:11:22,209 --> 01:11:24,545
<i>I'm the man that takes care of business.</i>
<i>That chick can have</i>...

856
01:11:34,114 --> 01:11:37,147
- I need to talk to someone.
- Ma'am, can I help you?

857
01:11:38,082 --> 01:11:39,391
Yeah.

858
01:11:41,314 --> 01:11:43,201
I need to talk to someone
about a homicide.

859
01:11:43,362 --> 01:11:44,639
Names?

860
01:11:46,370 --> 01:11:48,061
Erica Bain.

861
01:11:48,323 --> 01:11:50,079
She was the victim?

862
01:11:51,491 --> 01:11:54,906
No. She wasn't the victim.

863
01:11:56,260 --> 01:11:57,885
She was the...

864
01:11:58,691 --> 01:12:01,823
- She's...
- No "Erica Bain" under homicide.

865
01:12:02,947 --> 01:12:06,526
- Well, maybe there should be. You know?
- Pardon me?

866
01:12:09,701 --> 01:12:11,074
Nothing.

867
01:12:13,956 --> 01:12:15,581
<i>You gonna give me</i>
<i>some Radiohead too?</i>

868
01:12:16,164 --> 01:12:17,409
<i>Fucking woman!</i>

869
01:12:17,572 --> 01:12:21,401
<i>Are you a mommy?</i>
<i>You're a whore, right?</i>

870
01:12:24,101 --> 01:12:25,824
Erica?

871
01:12:28,453 --> 01:12:30,079
Is that you?

872
01:12:32,133 --> 01:12:34,916
- <i>Because I could not stop for Death...</i>
- Erica?

873
01:12:35,076 --> 01:12:37,084
<i>... he kindly stopped for me.</i>

874
01:12:37,252 --> 01:12:38,365
Erica?

875
01:12:38,534 --> 01:12:41,850
<i>The carriage held but just ourselves.</i>
<i>And Immortality.</i>

876
01:12:42,022 --> 01:12:43,614
Erica?

877
01:12:58,823 --> 01:13:00,284
<i>Mercer.</i>

878
01:13:00,454 --> 01:13:02,080
Hey, it's me, Erica.

879
01:13:04,166 --> 01:13:05,728
I know.

880
01:13:06,118 --> 01:13:08,802
- Is everything okay?
- <i>Yeah, I...</i>

881
01:13:10,119 --> 01:13:14,875
I just wanted to talk and l...
For some reason, I thought of you.

882
01:13:15,943 --> 01:13:17,699
<i>Okay.</i>

883
01:13:18,663 --> 01:13:20,322
<i>What's going on?</i>

884
01:13:21,095 --> 01:13:23,201
What do you do when you can't sleep?

885
01:13:26,372 --> 01:13:28,477
- Nothing.
- <i>Isn't that hard?</i>

886
01:13:28,997 --> 01:13:30,655
To do nothing?

887
01:13:31,652 --> 01:13:34,303
<i>Well, you sort of get used to it.</i>

888
01:13:43,461 --> 01:13:44,443
Erica?

889
01:13:45,254 --> 01:13:47,227
<i>Well, come on, what's happening?</i>
<i>Talk to me.</i>

890
01:13:47,398 --> 01:13:50,496
Did you sleep better
when your wife was beside you?

891
01:13:51,334 --> 01:13:53,056
I know I did.

892
01:13:54,022 --> 01:13:59,041
I couldn't feel my body unless his arms
were wrapped around me.

893
01:13:59,461 --> 01:14:02,145
<i>Yeah, well, my wife, she used to...</i>

894
01:14:02,981 --> 01:14:04,804
<i>... flip through the night.</i>

895
01:14:05,574 --> 01:14:08,292
So I called her a mackerel.

896
01:14:09,959 --> 01:14:13,667
I guess that's not the worst thing
in the world to wake up to.

897
01:14:14,534 --> 01:14:17,917
<i>Hey, you want me to stay on the phone</i>
<i>with you until you go to sleep?</i>

898
01:14:18,086 --> 01:14:19,429
No.

899
01:14:20,743 --> 01:14:22,401
You've been good to me.

900
01:14:23,912 --> 01:14:25,024
<i>Sleep tight.</i>

901
01:14:39,208 --> 01:14:40,550
Yeah.

902
01:14:41,161 --> 01:14:42,567
How late?

903
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:47,011
Look, I'm not busting your balls. You
told me it'd be there and it better be.

904
01:15:21,898 --> 01:15:23,621
Why do you think you can hurt people?

905
01:15:24,169 --> 01:15:26,406
- What?
- Just do damage and walk away.

906
01:15:27,529 --> 01:15:29,254
Don't you know what you leave behind?

907
01:15:29,419 --> 01:15:31,393
- Do I know you?
- Do you think about it?

908
01:15:32,970 --> 01:15:34,977
Does it keep you up at night?

909
01:15:36,139 --> 01:15:38,407
- Does it haunt you?
- Excuse me?

910
01:15:38,570 --> 01:15:39,650
Because it haunts me.

911
01:15:39,947 --> 01:15:42,051
Are you one of them
press paparazzo freaks?

912
01:15:42,218 --> 01:15:44,194
You got a fucking camera there?

913
01:15:44,524 --> 01:15:46,563
You can't take my fucking picture.

914
01:15:46,731 --> 01:15:50,027
You're gonna come to my fucking place
and take my fucking picture?

915
01:15:52,779 --> 01:15:54,023
You fuck!

916
01:15:54,699 --> 01:15:57,383
- You a fucking cop?
- You wish.

917
01:15:57,644 --> 01:16:00,327
Well, it looks like he fell from up there.

918
01:16:00,876 --> 01:16:04,586
Cause of death could be the fall.
It could be the crowbar stuck in his skull.

919
01:16:04,747 --> 01:16:06,886
I'd say 50-50 either way.

920
01:16:07,244 --> 01:16:08,706
Shit.

921
01:16:08,877 --> 01:16:10,764
Maybe 70-30.

922
01:16:11,564 --> 01:16:15,493
I mean, come on, man. How many people
wanted this prick dead? Besides us?

923
01:16:15,660 --> 01:16:19,555
Too many.
The problem is he knew all of them.

924
01:16:19,725 --> 01:16:21,863
He wouldn't let anybody
get this close to him.

925
01:16:22,029 --> 01:16:25,411
You think someone did us a favor?
Maybe we should put him on the payroll.

926
01:16:25,580 --> 01:16:28,133
What, like someone think
they're doing our job for us?

927
01:16:28,301 --> 01:16:31,367
Saying, "Hey, New York's finest,
I'm gonna send you a little message.

928
01:16:31,532 --> 01:16:32,581
This is how it's done."

929
01:16:33,581 --> 01:16:35,043
- Get a shot right there.
- Officer!

930
01:16:35,213 --> 01:16:37,123
Here we go. All right, I'll be back.

931
01:16:37,869 --> 01:16:39,845
Erica, are you okay? Oh, my God.

932
01:16:40,013 --> 01:16:42,152
- Get out.
- My God!

933
01:16:42,317 --> 01:16:45,132
- Get away!
- No, I won't get away.

934
01:16:45,998 --> 01:16:48,933
Don't touch me. I'm sick!

935
01:16:49,390 --> 01:16:51,430
I can see that.

936
01:16:55,790 --> 01:16:58,376
- We have to get you to a hospital.
- No.

937
01:16:58,544 --> 01:16:59,720
No.

938
01:16:59,886 --> 01:17:02,734
- Why not?
- I can't because...

939
01:17:02,926 --> 01:17:05,131
Oh, God. I can't.

940
01:17:07,087 --> 01:17:09,836
What kind of trouble are you in?

941
01:17:10,895 --> 01:17:12,324
You don't wanna know.

942
01:18:03,506 --> 01:18:05,546
Were you a nurse?

943
01:18:05,777 --> 01:18:07,850
When I had to be.

944
01:18:09,426 --> 01:18:11,947
This is going to leave a scar.

945
01:18:16,529 --> 01:18:19,116
I killed a man tonight.

946
01:18:20,658 --> 01:18:23,115
Because he did this to you?

947
01:18:24,306 --> 01:18:25,648
No.

948
01:18:27,218 --> 01:18:29,708
I would've killed him anyway.

949
01:18:33,236 --> 01:18:34,926
Back home...

950
01:18:35,699 --> 01:18:38,601
...they gave young boys guns.

951
01:18:40,052 --> 01:18:41,873
Made them kill their parents.

952
01:18:43,028 --> 01:18:45,199
Just to show us...

953
01:18:46,708 --> 01:18:48,234
...anyone...

954
01:18:48,596 --> 01:18:50,636
...can cross that line.

955
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:54,866
Anyone can be a killer.

956
01:18:57,493 --> 01:19:00,046
Each death leaves a hole...

957
01:19:00,596 --> 01:19:02,669
...waiting to be filled.

958
01:19:10,549 --> 01:19:13,331
Did the ME come back
with his liver temperature yet?

959
01:19:13,493 --> 01:19:17,170
Yeah, he's about... Dead about two hours
from when we got there.

960
01:19:17,558 --> 01:19:22,447
- So that puts us at what time?
- About 1:00, give or take.

961
01:19:23,157 --> 01:19:24,467
Damn.

962
01:19:25,301 --> 01:19:29,710
Okay, I want everyone from the subway
and from that market killing...

963
01:19:29,879 --> 01:19:32,693
...I want them all brought in again.
- We've done all of that.

964
01:19:32,855 --> 01:19:35,572
We need to do it again.
We need to think outside the box.

965
01:19:35,734 --> 01:19:38,452
But he hit him with a crowbar,
hefted him over the rail.

966
01:19:38,614 --> 01:19:41,931
We're talking about a different guy
here, man. Think about it.

967
01:19:43,063 --> 01:19:44,623
Maybe.

968
01:19:45,271 --> 01:19:48,434
What about the iPod?
You said it traced back to a kid.

969
01:19:48,598 --> 01:19:50,988
I thought I told you.
The kid's father is an attorney.

970
01:19:51,159 --> 01:19:53,166
- He wants a subpoena, but I'm on it.
- Get him.

971
01:19:53,335 --> 01:19:56,368
- Whatever you gotta do...
- All right. I'll call right now.

972
01:20:03,511 --> 01:20:05,420
Hey, Erica.

973
01:20:06,360 --> 01:20:09,011
No, I just wanna know how you slept.

974
01:20:09,848 --> 01:20:12,085
Hey, you wanna see what I do?

975
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:17,462
Well, meet me over at Wynnward Hospital
in Washington Heights.

976
01:20:17,625 --> 01:20:19,566
You'll get an idea.

977
01:20:20,215 --> 01:20:25,039
<i>East 14 and Broadway, East 14 and</i>
<i>Broadway. None confirmed at the time.</i>

978
01:20:30,648 --> 01:20:32,624
Why doesn't he march here?

979
01:20:32,794 --> 01:20:35,641
- March down the street.
- Ethan Grant, my man.

980
01:20:35,801 --> 01:20:38,354
Now sit your hippie ass down.

981
01:20:38,521 --> 01:20:40,245
You smoking pot?

982
01:20:40,473 --> 01:20:43,322
- I need to talk to you.
- My dad said not to get involved.

983
01:20:43,481 --> 01:20:46,264
Oh, yeah? Does your dad know
you smoke grass, huh?

984
01:20:46,426 --> 01:20:48,946
That's a lot more than
a misdemeanor these days.

985
01:20:49,114 --> 01:20:51,383
- Listen, I didn't see anything.
- I think you did.

986
01:20:51,545 --> 01:20:54,994
- Look at me. Hey, you selling this shit?
- No.

987
01:20:55,162 --> 01:20:56,439
Well, I believe you.

988
01:20:56,602 --> 01:21:00,312
Maybe a judge won't. Come on, Skippy.
Get your shit. Let's go. Come on.

989
01:21:07,579 --> 01:21:09,367
- Hey. Thanks for coming.
- Hey.

990
01:21:09,530 --> 01:21:10,675
Sure.

991
01:21:10,844 --> 01:21:13,778
- Nice jacket.
- Thanks.

992
01:21:14,203 --> 01:21:16,341
So, what time
you got to sleep last night?

993
01:21:16,506 --> 01:21:18,896
I don't know, pretty soon
after we hung up, I guess.

994
01:21:19,067 --> 01:21:22,330
- About 1, 1:30?
- Yeah. Something like that.

995
01:21:22,492 --> 01:21:25,721
Yeah. I ended up working all night.

996
01:21:27,035 --> 01:21:30,297
You know you're not gonna be able
to reference this on your show?

997
01:21:30,459 --> 01:21:32,697
Sure, if I knew what this was.

998
01:21:33,083 --> 01:21:35,986
We're gonna interview
a witness to a shooting.

999
01:21:36,956 --> 01:21:39,509
- Isn't that against procedure?
- Yeah.

1000
01:21:39,677 --> 01:21:41,499
But I've tried to talk to her twice...

1001
01:21:41,661 --> 01:21:44,027
...and she seemed real nervous
to talk to me.

1002
01:21:44,189 --> 01:21:46,611
I figure maybe if you were there,
she'll talk.

1003
01:21:46,780 --> 01:21:48,307
Why me?

1004
01:21:48,604 --> 01:21:50,580
Because you got me to talk.

1005
01:22:00,029 --> 01:22:01,655
Hi, Chloe.

1006
01:22:04,574 --> 01:22:06,548
How are we feeling today?

1007
01:22:07,358 --> 01:22:08,819
All right.

1008
01:22:13,246 --> 01:22:15,003
I brought a friend.

1009
01:22:18,591 --> 01:22:20,281
Hi, Chloe.

1010
01:22:25,568 --> 01:22:27,389
Hi.

1011
01:22:41,311 --> 01:22:44,507
So you feel like telling me what happened
to you that night now?

1012
01:23:00,673 --> 01:23:02,974
That's a pretty necklace.

1013
01:23:11,904 --> 01:23:14,010
You should tell them what you saw.

1014
01:23:15,072 --> 01:23:18,369
Whatever it was, tell them the truth.

1015
01:23:22,529 --> 01:23:24,318
It's okay.

1016
01:23:28,322 --> 01:23:29,948
I saw...

1017
01:23:36,354 --> 01:23:38,493
I saw nobody.

1018
01:23:40,866 --> 01:23:43,866
Come on, Chloe.
Tell me the truth now, all right?

1019
01:23:46,499 --> 01:23:47,873
And nobody saw me.

1020
01:23:56,324 --> 01:23:57,883
Okay.

1021
01:23:58,435 --> 01:24:00,258
Sorry if that upset you.

1022
01:24:01,571 --> 01:24:04,767
Well, I'm sorry that
I couldn't be more help back there.

1023
01:24:04,931 --> 01:24:07,747
Well, you definitely seemed to help her.

1024
01:24:07,907 --> 01:24:10,046
She sure liked your...

1025
01:24:10,213 --> 01:24:11,870
...necklace.

1026
01:24:12,036 --> 01:24:13,946
It meant a lot to me.

1027
01:24:22,436 --> 01:24:24,095
Erica?

1028
01:24:24,869 --> 01:24:28,414
- Yeah.
- Why'd you call me last night?

1029
01:24:29,412 --> 01:24:31,683
I told you, I couldn't sleep.

1030
01:24:33,093 --> 01:24:35,003
And you were in bed?

1031
01:24:35,685 --> 01:24:38,915
No. I couldn't sleep.

1032
01:24:48,262 --> 01:24:50,717
You wanna tell us again
why you didn't wanna come in?

1033
01:24:50,886 --> 01:24:54,268
- For what? To get back my iPod?
- Hey, watch your ass.

1034
01:24:54,437 --> 01:24:57,024
I don't know. I had mixed feelings.

1035
01:24:57,189 --> 01:24:59,710
I mean, I was kind of glad
those guys got killed.

1036
01:24:59,879 --> 01:25:03,359
- You were glad?
- Yeah. I know I shouldn't be, but I was.

1037
01:25:03,527 --> 01:25:07,455
- While we're young, give us a statement.
- Look, I didn't see any vigilante.

1038
01:25:07,621 --> 01:25:09,630
Those guys smacked me around
and took my iPod.

1039
01:25:09,798 --> 01:25:12,449
Then they hassled some black dude
sitting next to his kid...

1040
01:25:12,615 --> 01:25:16,193
...so we all got off,
except for some woman at the back.

1041
01:25:16,583 --> 01:25:18,142
A woman.

1042
01:25:18,311 --> 01:25:21,607
Yeah, just a woman.
She was staying out of it.

1043
01:25:21,767 --> 01:25:23,775
Maybe the vigi guy got on
at the next stop.

1044
01:25:23,943 --> 01:25:28,580
Can you describe this woman well enough
for an artist to make a sketch?

1045
01:25:28,743 --> 01:25:29,953
I can try.

1046
01:25:30,663 --> 01:25:32,485
<i>Where are you going</i>
<i>with this woman thing?</i>

1047
01:25:33,256 --> 01:25:34,433
I'm not sure yet.

1048
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:40,579
Women kill their kids, their husbands,
boyfriends, shit they love.

1049
01:25:40,744 --> 01:25:42,206
They don't do this.

1050
01:25:42,376 --> 01:25:43,837
- How you doing?
- They don't?

1051
01:25:44,008 --> 01:25:45,437
- Good.
- You need some more water?

1052
01:25:45,609 --> 01:25:47,037
- Nope.
- Okay.

1053
01:25:47,208 --> 01:25:50,175
Just think about the first moment
that you met her. All right?

1054
01:25:50,344 --> 01:25:52,614
Where you were, where she was.

1055
01:25:52,777 --> 01:25:55,013
Tell me anything that comes to mind.

1056
01:25:56,265 --> 01:25:58,207
She had light hair, I think.

1057
01:25:59,818 --> 01:26:04,323
And okay lips. And she was skinny.

1058
01:26:04,489 --> 01:26:09,345
But she had some ass.
You know, you could tell because...

1059
01:26:09,738 --> 01:26:13,153
- But you're not doing the ass, right?
- No.

1060
01:26:13,321 --> 01:26:14,881
Okay.

1061
01:26:16,105 --> 01:26:17,895
She had good skin.

1062
01:26:19,146 --> 01:26:20,870
It was smooth.

1063
01:26:21,035 --> 01:26:23,751
And nice breasts.

1064
01:26:23,915 --> 01:26:27,210
Yeah. Like, they were little,
like Kate Moss titties.

1065
01:26:27,370 --> 01:26:29,858
- But they looked good with...
- Try to focus on the face.

1066
01:26:30,027 --> 01:26:31,653
Oh, I'm sorry.

1067
01:26:33,098 --> 01:26:35,684
- Hey, you know what I do remember?
- What?

1068
01:26:35,850 --> 01:26:37,225
She was, like, on lockdown.

1069
01:26:39,050 --> 01:26:42,629
<i>I mean, shut off. Kind of scary.</i>

1070
01:27:32,525 --> 01:27:34,414
"It's not cream.

1071
01:27:36,462 --> 01:27:38,666
It's vanilla."

1072
01:27:46,350 --> 01:27:48,718
You left a hole in me.

1073
01:27:51,758 --> 01:27:53,668
But I'm done now.

1074
01:27:54,574 --> 01:27:56,168
You hear me?

1075
01:27:59,407 --> 01:28:01,097
I'm done now.

1076
01:28:05,456 --> 01:28:08,903
Great. It's Jennifer Aniston.
I knew he was bullshitting us.

1077
01:28:09,071 --> 01:28:11,820
No, not really. This is a phenomenon
that happens quite often.

1078
01:28:11,984 --> 01:28:14,155
The mind gets so saturated
with popular images...

1079
01:28:14,319 --> 01:28:18,182
...it's often difficult, especially for people
under 20, to recall something unique.

1080
01:28:18,352 --> 01:28:19,694
<i>That's Mr. Murrow.</i>

1081
01:28:19,856 --> 01:28:24,525
<i>He owns the parking out on</i>
<i>Roosevelt Island. That's not all he does.</i>

1082
01:28:24,944 --> 01:28:26,351
<i>What else does he do?</i>

1083
01:28:26,512 --> 01:28:29,294
- <i>You really wanna know?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

1084
01:28:29,457 --> 01:28:31,561
- <i>Then this is off the record.</i>
- Erica!

1085
01:28:33,104 --> 01:28:34,731
Who is it?

1086
01:28:35,026 --> 01:28:39,018
It's Detective Mercer.
Could I have a minute with you?

1087
01:28:40,209 --> 01:28:42,412
Yeah. Yeah, just a second.

1088
01:28:53,232 --> 01:28:54,574
- Hey.
- Hey.

1089
01:28:55,250 --> 01:28:57,836
I tried to call, but there was no answer.

1090
01:28:58,353 --> 01:29:00,241
The ringer must be off.

1091
01:29:00,946 --> 01:29:04,874
- Can I come in?
- Yeah, sure. Come on in.

1092
01:29:12,050 --> 01:29:15,880
- It's pretty dark in here.
- I like it like that.

1093
01:29:20,051 --> 01:29:21,741
Got something...

1094
01:29:24,211 --> 01:29:25,934
Is this yours?

1095
01:29:28,627 --> 01:29:32,172
- Where'd you find it?
- Spanish Harlem.

1096
01:29:32,756 --> 01:29:37,741
A uniform pinched the suspect's girlfriend
trying to pawn it.

1097
01:29:38,164 --> 01:29:40,619
He fit the description that you gave.

1098
01:29:43,060 --> 01:29:44,751
Oh, my God.

1099
01:29:45,076 --> 01:29:46,384
I need a favor from you.

1100
01:29:47,092 --> 01:29:50,442
I'd like for you to come downtown
and ID him in a lineup.

1101
01:29:55,829 --> 01:29:57,455
No. I can't.

1102
01:29:57,620 --> 01:30:01,004
I understand you're nervous,
but you won't be alone in there.

1103
01:30:02,517 --> 01:30:04,240
I promise.

1104
01:30:09,366 --> 01:30:11,088
I'll get my stuff.

1105
01:30:14,582 --> 01:30:16,044
Thanks.

1106
01:30:40,087 --> 01:30:41,777
Okay, let's go.

1107
01:30:42,294 --> 01:30:45,808
You're going to view five subjects,
and then I'm gonna ask you three questions:

1108
01:30:45,975 --> 01:30:50,099
Do you recognize anyone? Where do you
know them from? And what did they do?

1109
01:30:51,319 --> 01:30:53,326
Lights and blinds.

1110
01:30:55,703 --> 01:30:58,038
Number one, approach the mirror.

1111
01:31:02,871 --> 01:31:04,333
No.

1112
01:31:04,664 --> 01:31:07,413
Sit down.
Number two, approach the mirror.

1113
01:31:10,167 --> 01:31:11,596
No.

1114
01:31:11,801 --> 01:31:14,353
Sit down.
Number three, approach the mirror.

1115
01:31:26,073 --> 01:31:27,415
No.

1116
01:31:28,089 --> 01:31:31,089
Sit down.
Number four, approach the mirror.

1117
01:31:34,106 --> 01:31:36,593
I can see them all. It's none of them.

1118
01:31:37,082 --> 01:31:39,635
Sit down. You're sure?

1119
01:31:39,802 --> 01:31:42,387
Yeah. I'm sorry.

1120
01:31:43,578 --> 01:31:45,071
I really am.

1121
01:31:46,747 --> 01:31:48,405
I'm so sorry.

1122
01:31:53,946 --> 01:31:57,525
Damn, I thought we had him.
You think she just froze up?

1123
01:31:57,690 --> 01:31:59,698
Doesn't really seem like the type,
you know?

1124
01:31:59,866 --> 01:32:00,849
I don't know.

1125
01:32:05,499 --> 01:32:07,920
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1126
01:32:08,091 --> 01:32:10,294
That looked like
it was pretty tough on you.

1127
01:32:10,459 --> 01:32:14,354
It was. I was kind of hoping
I was finally done.

1128
01:32:14,523 --> 01:32:17,393
Yeah, well, I'm off now.
Let's go get some food.

1129
01:32:17,563 --> 01:32:21,306
- No, I'm not hungry. That's okay.
- No, you need to eat.

1130
01:32:24,123 --> 01:32:26,906
I can barely remember his hands.

1131
01:32:27,164 --> 01:32:29,368
Perhaps you need to forget.

1132
01:32:30,204 --> 01:32:31,632
I can't.

1133
01:32:32,956 --> 01:32:35,193
I miss who I was with him.

1134
01:32:37,084 --> 01:32:38,939
You know that feeling?

1135
01:32:42,332 --> 01:32:43,739
You know...

1136
01:32:44,605 --> 01:32:49,208
...this is Mughal. It was a gift
from David's grandmother.

1137
01:32:54,109 --> 01:32:56,051
Speaking of gifts...

1138
01:32:58,110 --> 01:33:00,925
You know, someone gave me
a gift the other night.

1139
01:33:01,598 --> 01:33:02,939
Yeah?

1140
01:33:05,246 --> 01:33:09,785
You recall that guy we saw on TV
at the coffee shop?

1141
01:33:10,814 --> 01:33:15,256
The one I've been trying to put away
for three years.

1142
01:33:16,510 --> 01:33:19,194
Apparently somebody else
must've had something against him...

1143
01:33:19,359 --> 01:33:22,840
...because we're not talking
about a 9 mm here.

1144
01:33:23,295 --> 01:33:27,288
It got real personal.

1145
01:33:27,903 --> 01:33:29,693
Yeah, I read about it.

1146
01:33:38,175 --> 01:33:41,404
We got some more information
on that subway shooting.

1147
01:33:44,353 --> 01:33:47,003
Turns out there was a woman on the car.

1148
01:33:47,809 --> 01:33:51,670
Now, all this time, we've been looking
for a man with a gun.

1149
01:33:52,609 --> 01:33:55,063
It was a woman with a grudge.

1150
01:33:57,665 --> 01:34:00,152
Well, I guess there's a lot of us
out there.

1151
01:34:07,457 --> 01:34:10,523
You know, Erica, when I was a rookie...

1152
01:34:12,514 --> 01:34:15,066
...I used to give myself this test.

1153
01:34:15,618 --> 01:34:20,833
I would ask myself, if there was someone
that I knew that had committed a crime...

1154
01:34:21,377 --> 01:34:24,028
...would I have the fortitude
to put them away?

1155
01:34:26,530 --> 01:34:28,056
What kind of someone?

1156
01:34:29,091 --> 01:34:34,720
Someone close to me.
Like the best friend I could ever...

1157
01:34:35,747 --> 01:34:38,113
I could ever hope to have.

1158
01:34:40,963 --> 01:34:42,140
And...?

1159
01:34:44,035 --> 01:34:48,442
I always hoped that I would have
the courage and the dedication to say yes.

1160
01:34:51,172 --> 01:34:52,863
And do you?

1161
01:34:53,923 --> 01:34:55,516
I do.

1162
01:34:56,387 --> 01:34:59,201
And it's important that you know that.

1163
01:35:01,380 --> 01:35:02,973
I know that.

1164
01:35:04,644 --> 01:35:07,033
It's what I admire about you.

1165
01:35:16,708 --> 01:35:20,865
One more piece of evidence,
and she goes down.

1166
01:35:22,725 --> 01:35:24,864
And I'm sure you'll find it.

1167
01:35:25,637 --> 01:35:30,176
You're a good detective.
You miss nothing.

1168
01:35:33,094 --> 01:35:34,916
I have to go.

1169
01:35:37,093 --> 01:35:39,429
- I got it.
- Okay.

1170
01:35:39,589 --> 01:35:41,182
Hang on.

1171
01:35:41,798 --> 01:35:43,260
Hey.

1172
01:35:52,038 --> 01:35:56,130
- I wonder what David would think of...
- Think of what?

1173
01:36:00,102 --> 01:36:02,490
This woman with a grudge.

1174
01:36:06,823 --> 01:36:08,416
I don't know.

1175
01:36:10,759 --> 01:36:12,734
The dead don't talk.

1176
01:36:14,247 --> 01:36:15,426
At least not to me.

1177
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:37,982
All right, thanks.

1178
01:37:02,921 --> 01:37:05,223
Hey, can I get Joey Mortell?

1179
01:37:09,418 --> 01:37:10,596
Crackheads.

1180
01:37:10,762 --> 01:37:14,537
<i>I got you stuck in traffic,</i>
<i>88th and 3rd Avenue.</i>

1181
01:37:14,698 --> 01:37:18,855
<i>Pull over at the corner, Roma's Pizza.</i>
<i>Get yourself a slice.</i>

1182
01:37:19,018 --> 01:37:22,314
- No, I'm not gonna be here that long.
- <i>You are gonna be there that long...</i>

1183
01:37:22,475 --> 01:37:25,704
...because I got traffic backed up on 3rd
all the way to 96th Street.

1184
01:37:25,867 --> 01:37:29,216
- Make yourself comfortable.
- <i>Well, I need you to do me a favor, okay?</i>

1185
01:37:29,610 --> 01:37:34,182
Can you run a trace on a call?
And I don't have a subpoena.

1186
01:37:34,347 --> 01:37:36,203
<i>But you'll get one, right?</i>

1187
01:37:36,843 --> 01:37:38,600
Yeah, if I have to.

1188
01:37:39,596 --> 01:37:40,936
All right.

1189
01:37:42,123 --> 01:37:44,032
Give me the date and the time.

1190
01:37:44,203 --> 01:37:46,276
<i>Two days ago, July 20th...</i>

1191
01:37:47,052 --> 01:37:49,190
...between 12 and 1:30 a.m.

1192
01:37:49,356 --> 01:37:52,006
<i>All right. Okay, I need the number.</i>

1193
01:37:52,173 --> 01:37:53,350
Hold on.

1194
01:37:56,844 --> 01:37:59,495
- <i>It's 917...</i>
- Yeah.

1195
01:37:59,660 --> 01:38:04,363
- <i>... 157</i>- <i>1431.</i>
- All right, give me the name.

1196
01:38:04,525 --> 01:38:07,689
Look, it's private, like I said.

1197
01:38:07,853 --> 01:38:09,608
<i>Okay, it's that kind of private. I see.</i>

1198
01:38:09,773 --> 01:38:12,675
All right. Okay, yeah, I got you covered.

1199
01:38:12,844 --> 01:38:15,495
- Okay, just call me, all right?
- <i>You got it.</i>

1200
01:38:22,638 --> 01:38:23,849
You seen this ring before?

1201
01:38:25,422 --> 01:38:26,915
It looks familiar.

1202
01:38:36,878 --> 01:38:40,042
I got a name. Shauna Nelson.

1203
01:38:40,206 --> 01:38:41,995
An address, a cell phone.

1204
01:38:42,159 --> 01:38:43,750
What'd she look like?

1205
01:38:44,014 --> 01:38:48,423
She had two eyes, a mouth and a nose,
right in the middle of her face.

1206
01:38:48,974 --> 01:38:51,113
Please get the fuck out of here.

1207
01:39:05,711 --> 01:39:06,890
Yeah.

1208
01:39:12,879 --> 01:39:16,109
Shut up. Shut up. That is...

1209
01:39:17,776 --> 01:39:19,302
It's true.

1210
01:39:20,241 --> 01:39:21,582
Hello?

1211
01:39:22,544 --> 01:39:23,886
Hello?

1212
01:39:24,496 --> 01:39:25,870
- Do you know this number?
- No.

1213
01:39:26,032 --> 01:39:28,171
Are you sure? 917.

1214
01:39:28,337 --> 01:39:31,206
Hey, you guys, are 917... Fuck you guys.
I'll see you later, okay?

1215
01:39:31,377 --> 01:39:33,067
- Bye.
- Later.

1216
01:39:51,730 --> 01:39:53,039
Hey!

1217
01:39:55,826 --> 01:39:57,800
- Are you Shauna?
- Did you just call me?

1218
01:39:57,970 --> 01:40:01,647
Yeah, l... I got your number from
the pawn shop. You had my ring.

1219
01:40:03,602 --> 01:40:06,155
Yeah. Motherfucker fucks some slut...

1220
01:40:06,323 --> 01:40:08,526
...gives me the ring
as a fucking make-up gift.

1221
01:40:08,691 --> 01:40:11,440
- Turns out he stole the shit.
- I wanna know where he is.

1222
01:40:11,698 --> 01:40:13,587
Can you tell me where he is?

1223
01:40:15,315 --> 01:40:16,525
- l...
- No. No.

1224
01:40:16,691 --> 01:40:19,057
- I need an address. Phone number, anything.
- No.

1225
01:40:19,218 --> 01:40:21,325
- Tell me where he is!
- No!

1226
01:40:23,091 --> 01:40:25,001
I saw what they did to you.

1227
01:40:26,291 --> 01:40:28,396
That shit can't happen to me.

1228
01:40:30,868 --> 01:40:33,803
The call lasted
three minutes and 46 seconds.

1229
01:40:33,971 --> 01:40:36,360
<i>From 12:26 to 12:30...</i>

1230
01:40:36,532 --> 01:40:41,355
...from 917-157-1431 to your cell phone.

1231
01:40:41,941 --> 01:40:43,980
Vicinity of Roosevelt Island.

1232
01:40:45,173 --> 01:40:47,540
<i>Did she tell you she was someplace else?</i>

1233
01:40:48,149 --> 01:40:50,931
- Yes, she did.
- I'm sorry, man.

1234
01:40:51,093 --> 01:40:52,337
But fuck her, right?

1235
01:40:53,013 --> 01:40:55,348
- <i>Fuck her.</i>
- Yup.

1236
01:40:55,509 --> 01:40:57,102
Fuck her.

1237
01:40:57,268 --> 01:40:59,308
Hey, do me a favor.

1238
01:41:00,118 --> 01:41:02,256
Keep this to yourself until...

1239
01:41:02,421 --> 01:41:05,323
...I can get that subpoena.
- <i>Didn't even go on the hard drive.</i>

1240
01:41:28,151 --> 01:41:29,459
<i>Action!</i>

1241
01:41:31,511 --> 01:41:33,333
<i>Think you're fucking with me?!</i>

1242
01:41:43,896 --> 01:41:48,565
<i>Popped your motherfucking cherry!</i>
<i>Over there. Let's even shit out.</i>

1243
01:41:52,664 --> 01:41:53,873
<i>Heads up!</i>

1244
01:41:54,328 --> 01:41:55,986
<i>Hollywood!</i>

1245
01:41:58,615 --> 01:42:01,485
<i>How cute. Lovebirds.</i>

1246
01:42:40,441 --> 01:42:42,003
<i>Action!</i>

1247
01:42:43,802 --> 01:42:45,843
<i>Think you're fucking with me?!</i>

1248
01:43:56,574 --> 01:43:59,257
- You guys wanna make money or not?
- Hell, yeah.

1249
01:44:00,957 --> 01:44:03,739
You know what to do. Stand on that corner
and keep an eye out.

1250
01:44:03,902 --> 01:44:05,910
Show me you can do this.
Show me you're ready.

1251
01:44:06,079 --> 01:44:09,559
Stand next to the four guys,
keep your mouth shut and your eyes open.

1252
01:44:09,726 --> 01:44:11,100
Cops come, what do you do?

1253
01:44:11,262 --> 01:44:12,506
- Run!
- Run, right?

1254
01:44:50,624 --> 01:44:53,723
Good. Listen, motherfuckers,
stand on that sidewalk, keep an eye open.

1255
01:44:53,888 --> 01:44:56,222
- How hard can that shit be? Right?
- Yeah.

1256
01:44:56,384 --> 01:44:59,701
Good. So get going. Get on
that fucking sidewalk. Come on.

1257
01:45:10,593 --> 01:45:11,935
You want something?

1258
01:45:12,482 --> 01:45:13,790
I want my dog back.

1259
01:45:16,866 --> 01:45:18,240
The fuck?

1260
01:45:18,690 --> 01:45:21,057
Hi. Hi, boy. It's me.

1261
01:45:21,570 --> 01:45:24,156
Hey. Hey, buddy. Hey.

1262
01:45:24,322 --> 01:45:25,947
Do you remember me? Huh, boy?

1263
01:45:26,562 --> 01:45:27,839
Come on, man.

1264
01:45:29,954 --> 01:45:31,133
Go, go!

1265
01:45:31,458 --> 01:45:35,136
No, you got me fucking waiting,
and I need an address!

1266
01:45:35,298 --> 01:45:37,470
For Reed Bryant. He came in yesterday.

1267
01:46:03,812 --> 01:46:05,220
Get away, bitch!

1268
01:46:05,412 --> 01:46:06,622
Who's the bitch now?

1269
01:46:12,901 --> 01:46:15,389
- <i>90 Clayton Avenue.</i>
- Thank you.

1270
01:46:45,638 --> 01:46:47,711
Get the fuck out of the road!

1271
01:47:21,736 --> 01:47:25,030
- Hey, puppy.
- Don't you know there's a leash law?

1272
01:47:27,144 --> 01:47:29,315
For a bitch like you!

1273
01:47:30,376 --> 01:47:32,897
It's just you and me
and the fucking dog again, bitch!

1274
01:47:33,064 --> 01:47:36,228
I made your boyfriend smile.
I'm gonna make you smile too, bitch!

1275
01:47:36,393 --> 01:47:39,359
- You think you can come after me, huh?
- Get on the ground!

1276
01:47:39,529 --> 01:47:43,271
Get on the fucking ground! Police!
On the ground! Lay flat on the ground!

1277
01:47:43,433 --> 01:47:45,407
- Drop the gun, Erica!
- Stay out of this!

1278
01:47:45,577 --> 01:47:47,235
- No.
- This is between him and me!

1279
01:47:47,402 --> 01:47:49,790
- You do not have the right.
- Yes, I do!

1280
01:47:49,961 --> 01:47:52,546
No. I have the right
to hunt him down and to shoot him.

1281
01:47:52,713 --> 01:47:53,695
Then shoot him, then!

1282
01:47:53,866 --> 01:47:56,549
I don't do that shit, I investigate it.
Now give me the gun.

1283
01:47:56,713 --> 01:47:59,047
- And what are you gonna do, Mercer?
- Come on.

1284
01:47:59,914 --> 01:48:01,670
- You gonna arrest him?
- Give me the gun.

1285
01:48:01,834 --> 01:48:03,328
- Arrest me, officer!
- Shut up!

1286
01:48:03,498 --> 01:48:05,058
- Give me the gun!
- Come on, cuff me!

1287
01:48:05,227 --> 01:48:07,944
- Shut up!
- Give me the gun, I said.

1288
01:48:08,842 --> 01:48:10,947
Come on. Good girl.

1289
01:48:11,466 --> 01:48:13,473
That's it. Good girl.

1290
01:48:15,339 --> 01:48:16,680
No.

1291
01:48:24,138 --> 01:48:28,841
Now, if you're gonna use a gun,
you make sure it's legal.

1292
01:48:29,003 --> 01:48:30,825
What the fuck are you doing, man?

1293
01:48:30,986 --> 01:48:32,744
- Ain't nobody talking to you.
- Come on...

1294
01:48:32,908 --> 01:48:35,241
- I saw that shit you did!
- You're a fucking cop!

1295
01:48:35,436 --> 01:48:36,418
- Not tonight.
- Come on!

1296
01:48:36,619 --> 01:48:39,783
- Put me in cuffs! Get me out of here!
- Shut the fuck up!

1297
01:49:00,205 --> 01:49:02,093
You can take me now.

1298
01:49:04,077 --> 01:49:07,622
Problem is, if you go down,
I go down.

1299
01:49:07,790 --> 01:49:11,499
No. I can't let you do that for me.

1300
01:49:22,190 --> 01:49:25,256
So you've got one person left to shoot.

1301
01:49:26,574 --> 01:49:27,980
What?

1302
01:49:28,142 --> 01:49:31,655
You see, there was never any vigilante.

1303
01:49:31,822 --> 01:49:35,434
It was just three punks
out on a killing spree.

1304
01:49:36,975 --> 01:49:40,074
They got a taste for it up in Central Park.

1305
01:49:41,519 --> 01:49:44,072
And they bought themselves a gun.

1306
01:49:46,159 --> 01:49:50,414
And they turned on each other,
the way they do.

1307
01:49:50,575 --> 01:49:52,463
And somehow...

1308
01:49:52,623 --> 01:49:54,696
...I got winged and...

1309
01:49:55,631 --> 01:49:57,126
...I did what I had to do.

1310
01:49:59,695 --> 01:50:01,289
Right here.

1311
01:50:04,592 --> 01:50:07,526
- I can't.
- You only shoot bad guys?

1312
01:50:08,336 --> 01:50:12,743
I've joined that club. Now you nick me,
graze me, but you wound me.

1313
01:50:16,913 --> 01:50:18,702
From about 3 feet.

1314
01:50:25,745 --> 01:50:29,161
- My hands are shaking.
- You just make sure you miss my heart.

1315
01:50:37,361 --> 01:50:40,297
Damn! Motherfuck, that shit hurts!

1316
01:50:40,466 --> 01:50:42,254
I'm sorry.

1317
01:50:42,737 --> 01:50:44,428
I'm sorry.

1318
01:50:44,817 --> 01:50:46,476
So am I.

1319
01:50:46,642 --> 01:50:50,384
Now you get out of here
before I lose my temper.

1320
01:51:40,820 --> 01:51:43,407
Baby, look at you.
She left you too, huh?

1321
01:51:44,533 --> 01:51:48,177
That's okay. I got you now.
You're gonna be fine. Come here.

1322
01:51:48,341 --> 01:51:50,381
Come here. Wait, wait, wait!

1323
01:52:03,414 --> 01:52:06,829
10-13, 10-13. Officer hit.

1324
01:52:06,998 --> 01:52:10,707
Three perps down at 90 Clayton.

1325
01:52:12,151 --> 01:52:13,972
Send a bus.

1326
01:52:56,312 --> 01:53:01,103
<i>There is no going back</i>
<i>to that other person...</i>

1327
01:53:01,912 --> 01:53:03,888
<i>... that other place.</i>

1328
01:53:04,249 --> 01:53:08,341
<i>This thing, this stranger...</i>

1329
01:53:09,209 --> 01:53:11,991
<i>... she is all you are now.</i>

1330
01:53:12,400 --> 01:53:23,389
THE END
