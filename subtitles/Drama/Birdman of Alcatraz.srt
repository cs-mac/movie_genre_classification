1
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:07,550
<i> You will see all the</i>
<i>man-made and natural beauties</i>

2
00:02:07,678 --> 00:02:10,300
<i>of the most spectacular bay in the world.</i>

3
00:02:10,431 --> 00:02:13,100
<i>You'll pass beneath</i>
<i>the famous Golden Gate Bridge,</i>

4
00:02:13,225 --> 00:02:19,346
<i>considered to be one of the most</i>
<i>striking structures ever erected by man.</i>

5
00:02:19,482 --> 00:02:24,559
<i>From the bay, you will thrill</i>
<i>to the magnificent San Francisco skyline.</i>

6
00:02:24,695 --> 00:02:28,479
<i>Your cruise ship, the Harbour King,</i>
<i>will circle Alcatraz,</i>

7
00:02:28,616 --> 00:02:33,159
<i>a maximum-security prison containing</i>
<i>the most dangerous criminals in America,</i>

8
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:37,119
<i>and has been the home of such</i>
<i>notorious figures as Al Capone,</i>

9
00:02:37,249 --> 00:02:40,120
<i>Baby Face Nelson</i>
<i>and Machine Gun Kelly.</i>

10
00:02:48,804 --> 00:02:51,259
That's the island of Alcatraz.

11
00:02:52,391 --> 00:02:56,056
There's a man leaving there today
after 17 years' imprisonment.

12
00:02:56,186 --> 00:02:58,642
His name is Robert Stroud.

13
00:03:00,607 --> 00:03:03,312
He's spent most of his life behind bars,

14
00:03:03,443 --> 00:03:06,528
including 43 years
in solitary confinement.

15
00:03:08,323 --> 00:03:12,570
He has never used a telephone
or driven an automobile.

16
00:03:12,703 --> 00:03:17,910
The last time he broke bread
with another human being was in 1916,

17
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:23,415
the year Kaiser Wilhelm ordered the
sinking of the <i>Lusitania</i> in World War I.

18
00:03:27,718 --> 00:03:31,929
My name is Tom Gaddis.
I wrote a book about this man.

19
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:41,102
<i> Our story</i>
<i>properly begins in the year 1912.</i>

20
00:03:41,232 --> 00:03:44,352
<i>A cargo of rebellious prisoners</i>
<i>was being transferred</i>

21
00:03:44,485 --> 00:03:49,278
<i>from the federal penitentiary at McNeil</i>
<i>Island, Washington, to The Big Top,</i>

22
00:03:49,407 --> 00:03:53,736
<i>the name given by convicts</i>
<i>to the prison at Leavenworth, Kansas.</i>

23
00:04:24,568 --> 00:04:25,599
Shut up!

24
00:04:27,446 --> 00:04:30,151
Make one more move
and I'll take you off at the neck.

25
00:04:42,753 --> 00:04:44,793
Robert F Stroud.

26
00:04:50,511 --> 00:04:52,918
Breaking that window
was a serious offence.

27
00:04:53,055 --> 00:04:55,463
It was hot. I was thinking of my lungs.

28
00:04:56,183 --> 00:04:59,967
Did you think about the consequences?
You might have started a riot.

29
00:05:00,104 --> 00:05:03,604
- Even a convict's got a right to breathe.
- Rights?

30
00:05:03,733 --> 00:05:06,770
I don't think you know
the meaning of the word.

31
00:05:06,903 --> 00:05:11,482
In 1909, in Alaska, you appointed yourself
judge, jury and executioner

32
00:05:11,616 --> 00:05:14,534
and killed one... Charles Dahmer

33
00:05:14,661 --> 00:05:19,572
because he allegedly beat up a friend
named Katie Malone... a prostitute.

34
00:05:22,752 --> 00:05:26,501
You were transferred here to Leavenworth
because of an inferior record.

35
00:05:26,631 --> 00:05:29,205
Now, I propose to give you a fresh start.

36
00:05:29,342 --> 00:05:33,921
Such rights as you will enjoy are listed
here in my rules and regulations.

37
00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:36,966
There are 86.
I suggest you memorise them.

38
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,350
I know 'em. They're the same in all pens.

39
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:43,894
They tell you when to eat,
when to sleep, when to go to the privy.

40
00:05:44,024 --> 00:05:48,568
Precisely. And what you'll do
for every minute 24 hours a day.

41
00:05:50,489 --> 00:05:54,273
You're going to be here
for nine long years, Stroud.

42
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:58,111
So with or without your cooperation,
I intend to make a man of you,

43
00:05:58,247 --> 00:06:00,536
before you check out these gates.

44
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:03,620
You'll conform to our ideas
of how you should behave.

45
00:06:03,753 --> 00:06:08,296
You'll learn the lesson now
or five years from now, but you'll learn.

46
00:06:11,636 --> 00:06:16,013
For breaking that train window, all your
privileges are suspended for 30 days.

47
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,631
That's all, Mr Ransom.

48
00:06:18,768 --> 00:06:20,568
Let's go.

49
00:06:28,527 --> 00:06:31,613
You're one of the new fish
from McNeil, huh?

50
00:06:33,075 --> 00:06:34,075
Yeah.

51
00:06:35,452 --> 00:06:38,323
Yeah, well, I'm Tony Qualen.
Who are you?

52
00:06:39,623 --> 00:06:41,023
Stroud.

53
00:06:43,377 --> 00:06:45,749
You're lucky to be in this cellblock.

54
00:06:48,382 --> 00:06:50,837
Boss here's a friend of mine.

55
00:06:52,594 --> 00:06:55,050
Picture of your mother?

56
00:06:55,722 --> 00:06:58,122
Put it back.

57
00:06:59,726 --> 00:07:01,766
Put it back!

58
00:07:13,074 --> 00:07:15,482
What did I do?

59
00:07:15,618 --> 00:07:17,860
Just don't touch it again.

60
00:07:38,641 --> 00:07:42,141
You know the guy
you're bunking with? Anthony?

61
00:07:43,313 --> 00:07:47,441
Understand you and him
had a little misunderstanding.

62
00:07:50,028 --> 00:07:52,483
Anthony is a friend of mine.

63
00:07:54,282 --> 00:07:56,773
A very good friend.

64
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:59,947
He didn't mean nothin',
pickin' up the picture.

65
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,680
Beat it.

66
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:12,081
What kind of nut are you anyway? Just
because he picked up a picture of Mama?

67
00:08:30,527 --> 00:08:31,642
Break it up!

68
00:08:31,987 --> 00:08:34,229
Stroud! Stroud!

69
00:08:38,661 --> 00:08:41,497
You ever mention
my mother again, I'll kill ya!

70
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,620
Stroud.

71
00:08:58,473 --> 00:09:00,513
What's the matter, man?

72
00:09:02,811 --> 00:09:06,061
What's eating you up inside, Bob?

73
00:09:06,189 --> 00:09:08,478
You act as though you hate everyone.

74
00:09:08,608 --> 00:09:11,693
You live in a pus-hole,
you act accordingly.

75
00:09:14,197 --> 00:09:19,618
All right, Bob. Maybe 30 days in the hole'll
make you happy to see a face again.

76
00:09:19,744 --> 00:09:22,200
Don't count on it... Harvey.

77
00:09:41,392 --> 00:09:45,888
I don't think 30 days in the hole
is gonna cool that jaybird off, Warden.

78
00:09:46,022 --> 00:09:49,188
Now, what do you suggest, Mr Kramer?

79
00:09:49,317 --> 00:09:51,356
He's as mean as a boar hog.

80
00:09:51,485 --> 00:09:56,194
If it was me, I'd keep him away from
the rest of the inmates permanently.

81
00:09:56,324 --> 00:09:59,075
Isolation? No.

82
00:09:59,201 --> 00:10:01,490
I don't give up on a man that easily.

83
00:10:01,621 --> 00:10:04,906
Stroud comes from good stock.
He'll shape up.

84
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:07,496
He's a dingbat, Warden.

85
00:10:07,627 --> 00:10:09,869
He's dangerous.

86
00:10:10,005 --> 00:10:12,710
He's my responsibility, Mr Kramer.

87
00:10:12,841 --> 00:10:15,925
Now, you let <i>me</i> worry
about his behaviour.

88
00:10:16,928 --> 00:10:18,728
Yes, sir.

89
00:10:56,844 --> 00:10:58,884
All right, Stroud.

90
00:11:44,226 --> 00:11:48,687
<i>Dearest Mother. I am feeling fine.</i>
<i>Hope you are the same.</i>

91
00:11:48,814 --> 00:11:51,270
<i>Everything is OK at this end.</i>

92
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:55,314
<i>Time sure does fly.</i>

93
00:11:55,446 --> 00:11:58,779
<i>Yesterday was</i>
<i>my fourth anniversary here,</i>

94
00:11:58,907 --> 00:12:01,363
<i>but I got no cake. Ha-ha.</i>

95
00:12:02,786 --> 00:12:06,369
<i>I guess everything would be all right</i>
<i>if I could just see you</i>

96
00:12:06,498 --> 00:12:08,954
<i>and give you a great big hug.</i>

97
00:12:09,793 --> 00:12:12,830
<i>I hope your cold is better.</i>

98
00:12:12,963 --> 00:12:15,003
<i>Your loving son, Robbie.</i>

99
00:12:39,157 --> 00:12:43,107
<i> Dearest Robbie.</i>
<i>I was here today to see you,</i>

100
00:12:43,244 --> 00:12:46,411
<i>but they would not let me in,</i>
<i>it being Saturday,</i>

101
00:12:46,539 --> 00:12:48,828
<i>with no visiting allowed.</i>

102
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,081
<i>But I saw Warden Shoemaker,</i>

103
00:12:51,211 --> 00:12:55,920
<i>and he was kind enough</i>
<i>to arrange for a visit next Friday.</i>

104
00:12:56,049 --> 00:12:58,291
<i>Until then, my darling,</i>

105
00:12:58,426 --> 00:13:03,172
<i>this little gift of fruit comes</i>
<i>with all my love. Mother.</i>

106
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:12,062
Guard, guard! Mr Kramer!

107
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:16,696
- What do you want?
- Did you know my mother was here?

108
00:13:16,821 --> 00:13:19,063
- Yeah.
- Why didn't you call me?

109
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:21,819
You know the rules.
No visitors on Saturday.

110
00:13:21,951 --> 00:13:23,908
That all you got in you? Rules?

111
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:28,782
Stop bellyaching. She said she'd be
here next week. You can see her then.

112
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:37,965
You ain't got much,
but you keep subtracting from it.

113
00:13:38,092 --> 00:13:42,006
Don't you know I gotta put you
on report for touching a guard?

114
00:14:46,162 --> 00:14:48,202
Mr Kramer...

115
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:53,625
If you shoot me on report,
I won't get no visit from my mother.

116
00:14:53,753 --> 00:14:56,540
You should have thought of that before.

117
00:14:56,673 --> 00:15:00,373
She came 2,000 miles.
All the way from Alaska.

118
00:15:03,596 --> 00:15:06,052
Do me this one favour.

119
00:15:07,058 --> 00:15:10,842
I just follow the rules.
Now get back to your seat.

120
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,106
- I tell you, I got to see her.
- And I told you to get back to your seat.

121
00:15:22,241 --> 00:15:25,444
You ain't a man, Kramer. You're dog puke.

122
00:16:00,446 --> 00:16:03,566
I just came from Kramer's widow.

123
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,784
I couldn't look her in the eye, Stroud.

124
00:16:10,582 --> 00:16:15,576
I feel responsible for her husband's death.
He warned me about you.

125
00:16:15,712 --> 00:16:19,413
He told me you were dangerous,
but I wouldn't listen.

126
00:16:21,551 --> 00:16:23,591
And how he's cold in his grave.

127
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:31,136
You've taken the lives of two people
and haven't felt a twinge of conscience.

128
00:16:31,269 --> 00:16:35,053
What do you want me to do?
Cry? Say I'm sorry?

129
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:37,859
I'm only sorry for Kramer's wife.

130
00:16:37,984 --> 00:16:42,196
- And the dead man?
- He was fixing to brain me with his club.

131
00:16:42,322 --> 00:16:44,361
I protected myself.

132
00:16:45,492 --> 00:16:47,735
No remorse, huh?

133
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:50,539
No pity. Just an animal.

134
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:55,582
Ain't that what these cages are for?
Animals?

135
00:17:02,259 --> 00:17:05,759
I have to make out a report
about this killing.

136
00:17:07,765 --> 00:17:10,517
I hope it'll help to hang you.

137
00:17:23,614 --> 00:17:27,991
<i> Stroud had three trials.</i>
<i>The first one was declared a mistrial.</i>

138
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:31,654
<i>In the second, he was sentenced</i>
<i>to life imprisonment.</i>

139
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:34,826
<i>He appealed and was granted a third trial.</i>

140
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,289
<i>On June 28, 1918,</i>
<i>he heard the final verdict.</i>

141
00:17:40,507 --> 00:17:44,968
Therefore it is now by the court
considered, ordered and adjudged

142
00:17:45,095 --> 00:17:50,136
that you be remanded to the custody of
the warden of Leavenworth penitentiary

143
00:17:50,267 --> 00:17:55,807
and kept in solitary confinement there
until the 8th day of November, 1918,

144
00:17:55,939 --> 00:17:59,355
and then and there be hanged
by the neck until you are dead.

145
00:17:59,484 --> 00:18:00,484
No!

146
00:18:02,863 --> 00:18:05,899
This sentence is unspeakable!

147
00:18:06,033 --> 00:18:08,072
You call this justice?

148
00:18:08,201 --> 00:18:11,238
You don't even know
the meaning of the word, sir.

149
00:18:25,053 --> 00:18:29,181
Forget it. It's "Katy bar the door" for me.
I'm done.

150
00:18:29,307 --> 00:18:31,346
Sit down, Robbie.

151
00:18:32,477 --> 00:18:34,277
Sit down.

152
00:18:38,191 --> 00:18:43,695
Look, Ma, you fought,
you spent all your money,

153
00:18:43,821 --> 00:18:47,819
you got old followin' me from jail to jail.

154
00:18:47,951 --> 00:18:50,192
It's time to douse the lights.

155
00:18:50,328 --> 00:18:54,824
I told you before, Robbie,
I will not let them kill you.

156
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:57,912
I'm going to Washington DC very soon.

157
00:18:58,044 --> 00:19:01,295
- I haven't begun to fight.
- Time's up.

158
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:09,382
You just don't know how to quit,
do you, Ma?

159
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:17,887
Did you think Mother was gonna
let them hurt my Robbie?

160
00:19:25,281 --> 00:19:27,320
<i>Carrying a petition for clemency,</i>

161
00:19:27,449 --> 00:19:31,399
<i>Elizabeth Stroud doggedly haunted</i>
<i>the offices of Washington officials,</i>

162
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:35,748
<i>in an effort to gain an audience</i>
<i>with the president of the United States.</i>

163
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:39,706
<i>Finally, she managed to see</i>
<i>Senator Ham Lewis.</i>

164
00:19:39,837 --> 00:19:42,839
<i>He reminded her</i>
<i>of the president's grave illness.</i>

165
00:19:42,966 --> 00:19:45,836
<i>Grasping at straws,</i>
<i>she pleaded with the senator</i>

166
00:19:45,969 --> 00:19:49,587
<i>to make an appointment for her</i>
<i>with the president's wife.</i>

167
00:19:49,723 --> 00:19:51,762
<i>Reluctantly, he agreed.</i>

168
00:20:05,113 --> 00:20:10,320
Tell me, Mrs Stroud, why do you think
the president should intervene?

169
00:20:10,452 --> 00:20:14,864
Mrs Wilson, the president is known
as the symbol of compassion

170
00:20:14,998 --> 00:20:17,619
throughout the whole world.

171
00:20:17,751 --> 00:20:19,577
I'm sure that deep in his heart

172
00:20:19,711 --> 00:20:24,456
he doesn't believe in the brutality
of an eye for an eye.

173
00:20:24,591 --> 00:20:28,720
I've never seen your husband,
but I've seen pictures of him.

174
00:20:29,639 --> 00:20:33,339
He has the face of a man
who has known great suffering.

175
00:20:34,435 --> 00:20:39,595
I think he'd understand what it means
to have the pack yapping at his heels.

176
00:20:42,568 --> 00:20:47,479
Mrs Wilson, they've turned on
your husband in his fight for peace.

177
00:20:47,615 --> 00:20:51,482
- They've broken his heart.
- Mrs Stroud, please.

178
00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:56,197
There's only one man left in the world
who can lend a helping hand to my son,

179
00:20:56,332 --> 00:20:58,787
and that's the president.

180
00:21:00,711 --> 00:21:03,167
Take the petition to him.

181
00:21:04,632 --> 00:21:08,332
I assure you, I give you my solemn oath,

182
00:21:09,845 --> 00:21:12,219
my son is a person of worth.

183
00:21:14,101 --> 00:21:15,901
Save him.

184
00:21:31,034 --> 00:21:33,074
Stroud! Listen!

185
00:21:38,959 --> 00:21:44,119
Hey, do you hear that, you cons?
President Wilson commuted Stroud to life!

186
00:21:50,053 --> 00:21:54,347
Well, I'll be damned. She pulled it off.

187
00:22:15,705 --> 00:22:17,744
Been expecting you, Harvey.

188
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:22,043
I have a telegram here from Washington.

189
00:22:24,297 --> 00:22:26,503
You probably know about it.

190
00:22:26,633 --> 00:22:28,672
I've heard.

191
00:22:29,427 --> 00:22:33,341
I think you will live to regret
that this wire ever came.

192
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:36,190
How come?

193
00:22:36,434 --> 00:22:40,563
Because you're going to spend
the rest of your life in deep-lock.

194
00:22:42,024 --> 00:22:44,479
- Who says so?
- The attorney general.

195
00:22:51,492 --> 00:22:53,531
Remember the judge's sentence?

196
00:22:53,661 --> 00:22:57,243
"And kept in solitary confinement
until you are hanged by the neck."

197
00:22:57,373 --> 00:22:59,449
But that ain't what the judge meant.

198
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:03,082
That's what the attorney general
says he meant.

199
00:23:08,592 --> 00:23:10,799
Look around you, Stroud.

200
00:23:10,928 --> 00:23:14,628
This is going to be your home
for as long as you live.

201
00:23:18,018 --> 00:23:20,889
Ain't much more
you can do to me, is there?

202
00:23:21,522 --> 00:23:23,350
A few things.

203
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:28,728
Consider this. You will not be permitted
to associate with the other prisoners,

204
00:23:28,863 --> 00:23:30,690
not even to exercise with them.

205
00:23:30,824 --> 00:23:34,074
You'll eat all your meals alone
for the rest of your life.

206
00:23:34,202 --> 00:23:38,366
Visiting and corresponding privileges
will be limited to your immediate family.

207
00:23:38,498 --> 00:23:43,243
And there'll be no work. Nothing to do
but count the hours and days and years.

208
00:23:46,464 --> 00:23:48,872
They're tearin' down my gallows.

209
00:23:49,009 --> 00:23:51,630
- To my great regret.
- Yeah.

210
00:23:51,761 --> 00:23:54,383
It must have galled you
to give that order, Harv.

211
00:23:54,514 --> 00:23:56,756
I think I got you figured out, Shoemaker.

212
00:23:56,891 --> 00:24:00,806
First day here you as much as asked me
to get down on my knees and whimper.

213
00:24:00,937 --> 00:24:03,179
I wouldn't do it then and I won't do it now.

214
00:24:03,315 --> 00:24:06,399
I won't lick your hand
and that's what eats you, keeper.

215
00:24:06,526 --> 00:24:09,563
You keep this in mind.
A man ain't whipped until he quits.

216
00:24:09,697 --> 00:24:12,567
And I'll never give you that pleasure.

217
00:24:17,288 --> 00:24:19,327
Now get outta here.

218
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:24,410
I'll never forget you as long as I live.

219
00:24:24,545 --> 00:24:27,546
No matter what happens to me,
no matter where I am,

220
00:24:27,673 --> 00:24:31,588
if I ever get a chance
to punish you further, I'll do it.

221
00:24:32,553 --> 00:24:35,258
Drop in from time to time.
See how long I stick around.

222
00:24:35,389 --> 00:24:39,434
I don't have to drop in on you.
I'll always know where you are.

223
00:24:46,901 --> 00:24:50,733
<i> Being in solitary</i>

Here's that Argosy magazine
you wanted, Shorty.

240
00:25:53,136 --> 00:25:55,175
Thanks, Bull.

241
00:26:07,692 --> 00:26:10,361
Do you want anything to read, Stroud?

242
00:26:12,155 --> 00:26:15,239
I want something from you, I'll ask for it.

243
00:27:43,206 --> 00:27:46,077
Stroud! Get in outta the rain, you nut!

244
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,017
You're all gut, you little runt.

245
00:32:04,223 --> 00:32:07,426
Hey, Stroud, what ya doin'
up there on the ceiling?

246
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:10,644
- Collecting beetles and cockroaches.
- I see.

247
00:32:14,067 --> 00:32:16,107
Beetles and cockroaches.

248
00:32:17,195 --> 00:32:19,651
Poor old Stroud. He's goin' bugs.

249
00:32:39,676 --> 00:32:42,132
Gettin' pretty big now, huh?

250
00:32:45,807 --> 00:32:48,263
About time for you to fly.

251
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,935
OK, kid, hop to it.

252
00:32:56,193 --> 00:32:58,649
Well, go ahead, fly.

253
00:33:00,073 --> 00:33:02,742
Well, come on, Runty, fly.

254
00:33:11,125 --> 00:33:13,996
What's the matter?
A little chicken-hearted?

255
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:32,645
All right, come on, you little punk. Fly!

256
00:33:39,612 --> 00:33:44,952
What are you gonna do when it's time to
go south for the winter? Walk to Mexico?

257
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:47,370
Hm.

258
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:53,491
All right, kid. Now give it a try.
Come on. Come on.

259
00:33:56,297 --> 00:33:58,752
Come on, Runt. Come on, fly.

260
00:33:59,758 --> 00:34:01,798
Here. Come on.

261

That bird's yellow to the core.

265
00:34:35,045 --> 00:34:37,500
You gonna be a quitter? Hm?

266
00:34:38,256 --> 00:34:42,384
Now you fly, you little punk, or I'll throw
you out on your ear, you hear me?

267
00:34:50,894 --> 00:34:51,894
Fly!

268
00:34:57,442 --> 00:34:58,442
Fly!

269
00:35:19,215 --> 00:35:21,254
Yellow, huh?

270
00:35:40,277 --> 00:35:41,277
Cold?

I mean you, Warden Younger.

282

00:37:08,242 --> 00:37:10,282
Open up. Go ahead.

288
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,430
Open it.

Where did you get that bird?

293
00:37:25,344 --> 00:37:28,013
Found him in the exercise yard, sir.

294
00:37:29,556 --> 00:37:32,012
Just put your finger on his feet.

295
00:37:36,772 --> 00:37:40,106
- What kind of a bird is that?
- A sparrow.

296
00:37:40,234 --> 00:37:44,232
It must have taken great patience
to train him. I admire that.

297
00:37:44,363 --> 00:37:47,364
Then I can keep him, sir?

298
00:37:47,491 --> 00:37:50,611
I don't see why not. Do you?

299
00:37:50,744 --> 00:37:53,200
You're the warden now, Jess.
It's up to you.

300
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:56,284
I think it'll be permitted.
Don't take advantage, Stroud.

301
00:37:56,417 --> 00:37:58,872
I wouldn't think of it, sir.

302
00:37:59,837 --> 00:38:02,292
- There is one thing.
- Yes?

303
00:38:02,423 --> 00:38:04,499
- I need some birdseed.
- Birdseed?

304
00:38:04,633 --> 00:38:05,633
Yes.

305
00:38:07,345 --> 00:38:09,634
I doubt if we've got any in the warehouse.

306
00:38:09,764 --> 00:38:13,133
I took the liberty of ordering some.
It's at the post office.

307
00:38:13,268 --> 00:38:16,767
I need your permission
to have it released.

308
00:38:19,065 --> 00:38:21,735
I like your nerve. You'll get your order.

309
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:23,140
Thank you.

310
00:38:23,278 --> 00:38:25,733
Trained sparrows in solitary!

311
00:38:31,077 --> 00:38:33,403
Pretty cute act you put on there.

312
00:38:33,538 --> 00:38:35,578
Just amusing myself.

313
00:38:38,418 --> 00:38:41,372
Still ignoring prison regulations,
aren't you?

314
00:38:41,504 --> 00:38:45,372
I hear you're going to Washington to plan
a new Federal Bureau of Prisons.

315
00:38:45,508 --> 00:38:47,418
Yes, I am.

316
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:50,222
Every pen run by the book, huh?

317
00:38:50,348 --> 00:38:53,218
If you mean uniformity, you're right.

318
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,939
- Drop me a postcard, Harv.
- I plan to keep in touch.

319
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:15,443
- You did middlin', Runty. Middlin'.
- Middling?

320
00:39:15,581 --> 00:39:19,958
He just saved your carcass, that's all.
Got the heart of an eagle.

321
00:39:32,723 --> 00:39:37,137
<i>When Younger allowed Stroud to keep</i>
<i>the sparrow, he opened the barn door.</i>

322
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:39,808
<i>Other inmates had relatives</i>
<i>send them canaries,</i>

323
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:42,810
<i>and the solitary block rang with song.</i>

324
00:40:06,967 --> 00:40:12,554
<i>Then one prisoner became bored with his</i>
<i>two canaries, and gave them to Stroud.</i>

325
00:40:13,598 --> 00:40:17,929
<i>That was a day penal authorities</i>
<i>will never forget.</i>

326
00:40:55,308 --> 00:40:57,550
What are you gawking at?

327
00:40:57,685 --> 00:40:59,927
Looking at that bottle.

328
00:41:07,946 --> 00:41:09,986
- Are you thirsty?
- Yeah.

329
00:41:33,555 --> 00:41:35,963
- I want the bottle.
- What for?

330
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:38,555
I got a use for it.

331
00:41:42,815 --> 00:41:44,558
What use?

332
00:41:44,692 --> 00:41:48,821
I ain't gonna cut my throat,
if that's what's worryin' you.

333
00:41:50,281 --> 00:41:53,781
- What about the refund?
- So I'll owe you a penny!

334
00:41:54,786 --> 00:41:56,826
How about it?

335
00:42:06,923 --> 00:42:08,963
Well, you're welcome.

336
00:42:13,722 --> 00:42:14,920
Son of a...

337
00:43:23,877 --> 00:43:27,709
- Well, now what do you want?
- That box you're sittin' on.

338
00:43:31,301 --> 00:43:34,587
- That's tough.
- It's just an apple box.

339
00:43:34,721 --> 00:43:37,177
- You could get another.
- I could.

340
00:43:37,974 --> 00:43:40,014
- Well?
- But I ain't.

341
00:43:41,478 --> 00:43:43,934
- Why not?
- I ain't so inclined.

342
00:43:47,776 --> 00:43:50,860
All right, I'll buy it off you.
What do you want?

343
00:43:50,988 --> 00:43:53,858
One pack of cigarettes? Two? Name it.

344
00:43:56,785 --> 00:44:00,831
If you showed me a hundred-dollar bill,
you couldn't have this box.

345
00:44:00,957 --> 00:44:03,792
What the hell is eatin' you?

346
00:44:06,671 --> 00:44:09,209
12 years I've known you, Stroud.

347
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:13,172
12 years, sun up and sun down, I've had
to look at that frozen mug of yours.

348
00:44:13,302 --> 00:44:16,553
And in all that time, never so much
as a how-de-do out of you.

349
00:44:16,681 --> 00:44:19,598
I try to treat you decent,
cos you got no bed of roses.

350
00:44:19,726 --> 00:44:22,643
So I put my head on the block
and I dummy up about the birds.

351
00:44:22,770 --> 00:44:26,353
Did you say thanks, my boy?
Did just once you say thanks?

352
00:44:26,482 --> 00:44:29,567
Or maybe I just didn't hear you.
You're a soft speaker.

353
00:44:29,694 --> 00:44:32,185
You want a pop bottle.
You want a pop bottle.

354
00:44:32,322 --> 00:44:35,192
Do I hear maybe
the word "please" someplace?

355
00:44:35,325 --> 00:44:37,151
Or could I be goin' deaf?

356
00:44:37,285 --> 00:44:40,654
"Hand over the box" says you,

357
00:44:40,788 --> 00:44:43,576
like you was the tsar of Russia
or somebody.

358
00:44:43,709 --> 00:44:48,834
You get this. I may be just a uniform
to you, but you got no patent on feelings.

359
00:44:48,964 --> 00:44:52,167
I'm a man, the same as you,
and I wanna be treated like one.

360
00:44:52,301 --> 00:44:55,218
So you'd better come up
with a few manners with me,

361
00:44:55,346 --> 00:44:59,046
or don't even expect the time of day
from yours truly!

362
00:45:24,875 --> 00:45:26,875
Mr Ransom.

363
00:45:41,935 --> 00:45:46,478
- You know what I think, Bull?
- I don't give a damn what you think.

364
00:45:48,775 --> 00:45:51,895
I think you're absolutely right.

365
00:45:52,028 --> 00:45:55,113
I admire ya for sounding off like that.

366
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:03,118
I had it comin'.

367
00:46:04,457 --> 00:46:07,957
You always treated me square.
You been good to me.

368
00:46:10,923 --> 00:46:13,379
So there's something I wanna do.

369
00:46:16,804 --> 00:46:19,342
I wanna apologise to you.

370
00:46:26,564 --> 00:46:29,648
I ain't apologised to anybody in 20 years.

371
00:47:58,157 --> 00:48:01,111
- Hey, Stroud.
- Yeah?

372
00:48:01,703 --> 00:48:03,826
My bird won't sing.

373
00:48:03,955 --> 00:48:05,994
Is he sick?

374
00:48:06,124 --> 00:48:08,163
I'll check him.

375
00:48:10,211 --> 00:48:12,667
You sick, little baby canary Jack?

376
00:48:14,298 --> 00:48:16,338
Say "tweety-dee", sweetheart.

377
00:48:17,969 --> 00:48:20,008
Tweet tweet tweet tweet.

378
00:48:21,639 --> 00:48:23,467
I don't know.

379
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:28,097
You been giving him special feedings
of grasshoppers and bugs like I told you?

380
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:30,270
I can't find any!

381
00:48:31,525 --> 00:48:34,692
By the time I get to the bullpen,
you cleaned it out!

382
00:48:35,821 --> 00:48:38,490
What do you want <i>me</i> to do?

383
00:48:39,366 --> 00:48:43,031
You got a way with birds.
You take Jack for a while, huh?

384
00:48:43,162 --> 00:48:45,201
What about birdseed?

385
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:49,458
All right, I'll split mine with you.

386
00:48:49,585 --> 00:48:53,084
- What do you say?
- All right. Send him in.

387
00:49:02,014 --> 00:49:05,064
Only for about a year or so
and then I want him back.

388
00:49:05,365 --> 00:49:06,517
OK.

389
00:49:18,782 --> 00:49:22,281
You be careful, take it easy
and don't mash him.

390
00:49:28,958 --> 00:49:32,043
You don't care of him, I'll bust you apart.

391
00:49:33,171 --> 00:49:35,377
- Don't worry, Feto.
- Come on, Gomez.

392
00:49:35,507 --> 00:49:37,962
It's your exercise period.

393
00:49:58,406 --> 00:50:01,276
Well, how about it, Stroud? Is he sick?

394
00:50:02,827 --> 00:50:05,697
- I don't think so.
- Why don't he sing?

395
00:50:09,417 --> 00:50:12,287
- It wouldn't be polite.
- Don't be smart!

396
00:50:14,714 --> 00:50:18,414
Feto, don't you know
a lady canary never sings?

397
00:50:19,135 --> 00:50:21,174
Lady canary?

398
00:50:22,263 --> 00:50:26,177
- You mean Jack's a broad canary?
- Yep. A hen.

399
00:50:30,896 --> 00:50:33,518
Well, tough luck, Bob.

400
00:50:33,649 --> 00:50:36,521
You're stuck with a bird that don't sing.

401
00:50:37,321 --> 00:50:39,360
Use up a lot of birdseed, huh?

402
00:50:43,535 --> 00:50:47,367
<i> Working with a razor blade</i>
<i>and a jagged piece of glass,</i>

403
00:50:47,497 --> 00:50:50,582
<i>Stroud cut 128 slats,</i>

404
00:50:50,709 --> 00:50:56,747
<i>in addition to roof boards,</i>
<i>tier bars, gate pieces and a handle.</i>

405
00:50:56,882 --> 00:51:01,010
<i>Every joint was charred for hardness</i>
<i>and hand-fitted,</i>

406
00:51:01,136 --> 00:51:03,176
<i>since he had no glue.</i>

407
00:51:04,348 --> 00:51:07,633
<i>The birdcage took</i>
<i>seven months to complete.</i>

408
00:51:11,605 --> 00:51:14,559
Bob, that's a hell of a job you did there.

409
00:51:14,691 --> 00:51:17,147
It's all right. Not bad.

410
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:21,073
- Next one'll be better.
- The next one?

411
00:51:21,199 --> 00:51:23,654
What do you want another one for?

412
00:51:25,953 --> 00:51:29,038
Ain't you got eyes? Mr and Mrs.

413
00:51:32,043 --> 00:51:34,534
There's gonna be
some procreation around here.

414
00:51:34,671 --> 00:51:37,755
- Procre... what?
- New life. Birth.

415
00:51:39,258 --> 00:51:41,298
- In a prison?
- Yep.

416
00:51:41,969 --> 00:51:44,507
Well, I guess they won't mind.

417
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:47,723
Canaries are always behind bars anyway.

418
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:09,325
It's springtime outside, slugger.

419
00:52:12,001 --> 00:52:14,456
You best go find out who you are.

420
00:52:19,383 --> 00:52:20,983
Come on.

421
00:52:23,595 --> 00:52:27,296
Now what's wrong with you,
you old buzzard? Come on.

422
00:52:33,188 --> 00:52:35,644
Don't be afraid.

423
00:52:38,902 --> 00:52:41,607
Out there you can kick up the dust.

424
00:52:41,739 --> 00:52:44,230
You can dance to fiddle music.

425
00:52:44,366 --> 00:52:46,406
Watch the alfalfa bloom.

426
00:52:50,123 --> 00:52:53,207
If you like, you can... see gold teeth.

427
00:52:54,294 --> 00:52:57,164
Taste sweet whisky and red-eyed gravy.

428
00:52:58,214 --> 00:53:01,714
The air breathes easy, nights move faster,

429
00:53:03,678 --> 00:53:06,134
and you tell time by the clock.

430
00:53:06,765 --> 00:53:09,682
Now you don't wanna be a jailbird
all your life, do ya?

431
00:53:09,809 --> 00:53:12,051
You're a highballin' sparrow.

432
00:53:12,187 --> 00:53:14,974
So you fly high, old cock.

433
00:53:15,106 --> 00:53:18,558
Go out there and bite the stars - for me.

434
00:53:18,693 --> 00:53:21,480
Find yourself a fat mama
and make a family.

435
00:53:21,613 --> 00:53:23,413
You hear?

436
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:40,940
Beat it.

437
00:54:01,946 --> 00:54:03,985
Hey, Stroud.

438
00:54:04,115 --> 00:54:06,154
Yeah, Feto?

439
00:54:07,034 --> 00:54:10,320
- My bird laid an egg, huh?
- <i>My</i> bird laid an egg.

440
00:54:11,247 --> 00:54:13,785
Why, you stinkin' crook!

441
00:54:13,916 --> 00:54:16,159
I only loaned you my canary!

442
00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:18,334
For a year.

443
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:22,087
I want half them eggs.

444
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:28,093
What for? You gonna make an omelette?

445
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:33,383
Any con who'd steal canary eggs
from another con is a dirty fink!

446
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,520
And a rat!

447
00:54:41,153 --> 00:54:43,691
How many, Stroud?

448
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:44,822
Two?

449
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:52,069
How many, Stroud?

450
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:55,705
Three? Dirty crook.

451
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:59,761
How many?

452
00:55:02,091 --> 00:55:03,091
Four.

453
00:55:04,093 --> 00:55:05,893
How many?

454
00:55:21,736 --> 00:55:25,021
Hey, Stroud. Anything happen yet?

455
00:55:28,159 --> 00:55:32,287
Now it's been 20 days and 18 hours.
What's goin' on in there?

456
00:55:50,432 --> 00:55:54,133
- Hey, Bob, what's that noise in there?
- Quiet, Feto.

457
00:58:02,943 --> 00:58:05,398
Feto, you're a godfather.

458
00:58:57,623 --> 00:59:01,538
<i> Sealed off from the world,</i>

<i>they would never turn on him,</i>

462
00:59:13,348 --> 00:59:16,763
<i>he developed a deep but private</i>
<i>love for his canaries,</i>

463
00:59:16,893 --> 00:59:21,021
<i>as he watched the cycle of love</i>
<i>and mating and issuing forth.</i>

464
00:59:23,191 --> 00:59:27,937
<i>Then, one spring day,</i>
<i>an old friend came back.</i>

465
00:59:43,379 --> 00:59:46,878
Runty! What the hell
are you doin' back here?

466
00:59:50,260 --> 00:59:55,006
Too tough out there, huh?
Come back for a little prison security.

467
01:00:02,272 --> 01:00:05,143
I guess you're a lifer, pal, just like me.

468
01:00:43,732 --> 01:00:47,231
Hey, Stroud. How come
the birds ain't singin'?

469
01:00:48,653 --> 01:00:51,524
Because they're sick, and so's mine.

470
01:00:52,992 --> 01:00:55,198
Hey, Stroud.

471
01:00:55,327 --> 01:00:57,367
My bird's gonna kick off?

472
01:01:02,043 --> 01:01:06,954
"Dreaded among breeders is a highly
contagious disease called septic fever."

473
01:01:07,089 --> 01:01:09,627
"It's actual existence can only be surmised

474
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:12,795
by a postmortem by
a veterinary surgeon trained in..."

475
01:01:12,928 --> 01:01:15,087
- Bob!
- Pipe down, Gomez.

476
01:01:15,222 --> 01:01:17,630
"Death may be rapid or delayed."

477
01:01:17,767 --> 01:01:21,551
"Faeces are abnormal
and always pale yellow in colour."

478
01:01:21,687 --> 01:01:24,143
"There's no practical remedy."

479
01:01:44,086 --> 01:01:45,486
Stroud?

480
01:01:46,588 --> 01:01:50,420
I found <i>Bacillus pasteurella</i>
in great quantity.

481
01:01:50,550 --> 01:01:55,378
I'd make an educated guess
that there's a filterable virus.

482
01:01:55,514 --> 01:01:57,921
That it is septic fever?

483
01:01:58,058 --> 01:01:59,858
Possibly.

484
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:02,895
Are there any chemicals
or medicines or anything?

485
01:02:03,021 --> 01:02:07,233
I couldn't find any literature on
the disease. Apparently there isn't any.

486
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:12,400
So, without any specific drug, I'm afraid
there isn't much I can do to help.

487
01:02:12,531 --> 01:02:15,532
Thanks, Doc. I appreciate what you done.

488
01:02:15,659 --> 01:02:16,859
Sorry.

489
01:02:45,231 --> 01:02:47,271
Any change?

490
01:03:02,248 --> 01:03:03,448
Runty.

491
01:03:06,378 --> 01:03:07,578
Shame.

492
01:03:13,761 --> 01:03:18,921
He wasn't much of a bird. I threw him out,
but I guess it was too tough for him.

493
01:03:19,058 --> 01:03:22,343
He had to come back
where he could freeload.

494
01:03:23,771 --> 01:03:26,226
He was a born panhandler.

495
01:03:29,151 --> 01:03:32,235
Tried to get rid of him
as late as last Friday.

496
01:03:32,363 --> 01:03:36,491
I warned him, but he wouldn't
listen to me. He was too smart.

497
01:03:38,535 --> 01:03:42,035
He'd rather have the walls
than somebody to talk to.

498
01:03:45,959 --> 01:03:48,415
He didn't amount to much.

499
01:04:17,701 --> 01:04:19,501
Hey, Bob.

500
01:04:21,871 --> 01:04:26,368
You know Ape?
The baby bird you slipped me.

501
01:04:29,379 --> 01:04:33,080
Well, in case you're interested,
he just knocked off.

502
01:04:38,389 --> 01:04:39,389
Punk.

503
01:04:42,601 --> 01:04:45,472
He dropped like he got shot in the head.

504
01:04:48,274 --> 01:04:52,402
Reminded me of an old girlfriend
of mine named Peggy... Beeman.

505
01:04:53,612 --> 01:04:56,282
What a face. Like a pan full of worms.

506
01:04:57,825 --> 01:05:01,111
But stacked. Like to make
your tongue hang out.

507
01:05:02,079 --> 01:05:04,487
Good-hearted broad, you know.

508
01:05:04,623 --> 01:05:07,293
She used to put out to me.

509
01:05:07,418 --> 01:05:10,419
And every other guy
in the neighbourhood.

510
01:05:10,546 --> 01:05:12,586
A bum, in other words.

511
01:05:13,966 --> 01:05:17,253
Well, she had a bird too. A parrot.

512
01:05:18,263 --> 01:05:20,719
And he too was ugly also.

513
01:05:23,894 --> 01:05:28,354
And one time I came up to her room,
and the door was open,

514
01:05:29,441 --> 01:05:33,652
and she was tryin' to teach
the parrot to say somethin'.

515
01:05:33,779 --> 01:05:38,654
You'll get a boot outta this, Bob.
You know what she wanted him to say?

516
01:05:38,784 --> 01:05:40,823
"I love you, Peggy."

517
01:05:41,620 --> 01:05:45,700
Over and over, you know,
she kept at him. "I love you, Peggy."

518
01:05:45,832 --> 01:05:48,406
Oh, them two uglies.

519
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:53,501
I figured she was some kinda nut, so
I never seen her no more after that time.

520
01:05:54,841 --> 01:05:56,881
Good old Peg.

521
01:05:59,137 --> 01:06:03,218
So what happens?
So I wind up in the can,

522
01:06:03,351 --> 01:06:06,435
and I'm talking to the birds
just like she did.

523
01:06:09,107 --> 01:06:13,151
You know... I gotta admit it,

524
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:20,825
for the first time since I been in stir,

525
01:06:22,745 --> 01:06:25,830
them baby canaries,
they make me feel good.

526
01:06:34,007 --> 01:06:38,135
You know, it ain't just right
to flush Apey down the toilet bowl.

527
01:06:39,303 --> 01:06:42,803
Hey, Stroud, what am I
supposed to do with him, huh?

528
01:06:54,570 --> 01:06:56,609
What am I gonna do?

529
01:06:58,866 --> 01:07:00,666
Hey, Bob?

530
01:07:09,668 --> 01:07:13,333
<i> Stroud struck back</i>
<i>at the oldest enemy of all.</i>

531
01:07:13,464 --> 01:07:18,671
<i>Wash the cages, sterilise</i>
<i>the cell from top to bottom,</i>

532
01:07:18,802 --> 01:07:22,302
<i>read everything in</i>
<i>the prison library about birds.</i>

533
01:07:22,931 --> 01:07:28,092
<i>He learned of oxidisers, which had been</i>
<i>used as a poultry germicide for years.</i>

534
01:07:28,896 --> 01:07:33,226
<i>He wrote to his mother, asking</i>
<i>for these drugs, plus equipment.</i>

535
01:07:34,277 --> 01:07:37,895
<i>While waiting, he tried</i>
<i>fantastic concoctions on his birds,</i>

536
01:07:38,031 --> 01:07:41,945
<i>like a sulphur solution</i>
<i>made from the heads of matches.</i>

537
01:07:52,128 --> 01:07:55,213
<i>The birds died with increasing swiftness.</i>

538
01:07:56,674 --> 01:08:00,340
<i>The package of drugs and</i>
<i>equipment came from Mother.</i>

539
01:08:00,470 --> 01:08:04,717
<i>With little or no knowledge of the amount</i>
<i>of chemicals a canary could tolerate,</i>

540
01:08:04,849 --> 01:08:09,392
<i>Stroud proceeded to administer</i>
<i>the oxidisers to his sick birds.</i>

541
01:08:21,784 --> 01:08:25,616
<i>Clearly, this drug was</i>
<i>no cure for septic fever,</i>

542
01:08:25,746 --> 01:08:29,661
<i>but Stroud persisted,</i>
<i>trying different combinations.</i>

543
01:08:33,963 --> 01:08:36,086
<i>The birds still died.</i>

544
01:08:36,215 --> 01:08:38,587
<i>However, Stroud made one discovery..</i>

545
01:08:38,718 --> 01:08:42,632
<i>Before death, their temperature</i>
<i>dropped to normal.</i>

546
01:08:42,763 --> 01:08:46,713
<i>He concluded the chemicals</i>
<i>were too harsh, too caustic.</i>

547
01:08:46,851 --> 01:08:50,551
<i>He decided to buffer them</i>
<i>with effervescent sodas.</i>

548
01:08:50,688 --> 01:08:52,727
<i>The birds died.</i>

549
01:08:55,026 --> 01:08:58,312
Hey, Stroud! When you gonna
find a medicine for my birds?

550
01:08:58,447 --> 01:09:00,605
They're droppin' like flies!

551
01:09:00,741 --> 01:09:03,825
- We'll just have to wait.
- Wait?

552
01:09:03,952 --> 01:09:06,408
I'm gonna kill 'em all!

553
01:09:15,380 --> 01:09:18,381
<i>Finally, there was only</i>
<i>one more buffering agent left</i>

554
01:09:18,508 --> 01:09:22,209
<i>in his tiny arsenal of drugs..</i>
<i>Citrocarbonate.</i>

555
01:09:25,891 --> 01:09:28,761
<i>He combined this</i>
<i>with potassium chlorate.</i>

556
01:09:34,441 --> 01:09:39,399
<i>He dosed his birds. After that,</i>
<i>all he could do was hope.</i>

557
01:09:42,992 --> 01:09:45,661
- Three o'clock, Bob.
- Thanks, Johnson.

558
01:10:55,983 --> 01:10:57,783
Hey, Bob?

559
01:10:59,278 --> 01:11:01,947
What happened? Why is that bird singin'?

560
01:11:05,492 --> 01:11:07,568
You find a medicine?

561
01:11:11,249 --> 01:11:14,120
Go to it, kid. Sing your heart out.

562
01:11:40,028 --> 01:11:43,942
<i> The years passed,</i>
<i>and news of Stroud's medicine spread</i>

563
01:11:44,074 --> 01:11:46,280
<i>to the gentle world of bird owners.</i>

564
01:11:48,370 --> 01:11:52,699
<i>People began to wonder who</i>
<i>this strange new bird doctor was.</i>

565
01:11:56,796 --> 01:11:59,666
<i>Finally, someone got curious.</i>

566
01:12:06,806 --> 01:12:11,633
Bob, did you enter some kind of a contest
in one of those canary magazines?

567
01:12:11,769 --> 01:12:14,058
Yeah. I won second prize - a roller canary.

568
01:12:14,188 --> 01:12:18,233
Well, you'd better go pick it up.
It's in the deputy's office.

569
01:12:18,359 --> 01:12:19,359
Good.

570
01:12:25,366 --> 01:12:27,405
- What's up?
- Not a thing.

571
01:12:43,468 --> 01:12:45,508
You must be Mr Stroud.

572
01:12:49,433 --> 01:12:52,718
Here you are. Your second prize.

573
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:57,141
A night roller of St Andreasburg stock.

574
01:13:04,823 --> 01:13:07,694
I'm Mrs Stella Johnson. I offered the prize.

575
01:13:08,702 --> 01:13:12,201
- Who let you in?
- The warden. It took three days.

576
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,669
Well, I suppose you wonder why I'm here.

577
01:13:19,588 --> 01:13:24,334
Well, I kept reading your articles
and letters to the journal.

578
01:13:25,261 --> 01:13:28,677
Then I tried your cure of oxidising agents

579
01:13:28,806 --> 01:13:32,934
on one of my birds with septic fever,
and, by golly, it worked.

580
01:13:34,354 --> 01:13:38,434
So I began to wonder
who this new bird doctor was.

581
01:13:38,566 --> 01:13:44,770
And when you won the prize I put up,
my curiosity really got the best of me.

582
01:13:45,990 --> 01:13:51,151
So I just had to find out who
Box 7, Leavenworth, Kansas was.

583
01:13:52,413 --> 01:13:58,037
So I... I wrote to the postmaster
at Leavenworth and asked him,

584
01:13:58,169 --> 01:14:02,214
and he told me it was
the federal penitentiary.

585
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:04,795
Why did you come to see me?

586
01:14:04,926 --> 01:14:09,055
Well, you see,
I live in Shelbyville, Indiana.

587
01:14:09,181 --> 01:14:13,677
And I was visiting a cousin in St Louis,
and Leavenworth isn't far...

588
01:14:13,811 --> 01:14:17,808
You were visiting in St Louis
and you carried him all the way with you?

589
01:14:19,566 --> 01:14:21,606
Well, the way it was...

590
01:14:23,153 --> 01:14:25,193
I was going...

591
01:14:26,115 --> 01:14:27,988
I thought...

592
01:14:28,325 --> 01:14:29,325
Yes?

593
01:14:32,830 --> 01:14:36,958
Mr Stroud, I'm terribly sorry
for taking so much of your time.

594
01:14:39,169 --> 01:14:41,209
Good luck with the roller.

595
01:14:42,005 --> 01:14:43,832
Mrs Johnson.

596
01:14:46,051 --> 01:14:48,838
Thank you for bringing him.

597
01:14:48,971 --> 01:14:52,056
Well, actually, you know, I...

598
01:14:52,183 --> 01:14:55,268
I did have an idea when I came here.

599
01:14:56,855 --> 01:14:57,855
Idea?

600
01:14:57,981 --> 01:15:01,848
Have you ever thought
of selling your bird remedies?

601
01:15:05,071 --> 01:15:06,871
Go ahead.

602
01:15:08,283 --> 01:15:09,683
Well...

603
01:15:10,285 --> 01:15:14,863
I have a little money. Not much. But
I believe it would be a good investment.

604
01:15:14,998 --> 01:15:18,616
You make 'em and I sell 'em.
I've even thought of a name.

605
01:15:18,752 --> 01:15:20,625
Stroud's Specifics.

606
01:15:22,255 --> 01:15:24,295
Well, I'll be darned.

607
01:15:26,259 --> 01:15:29,426
You said your name
was Mrs Stella Johnson.

608
01:15:29,554 --> 01:15:31,594
- I'm a widow woman.
- I see.

609
01:15:32,682 --> 01:15:35,305
My husband passed away
eight years ago.

610
01:15:35,436 --> 01:15:37,436
I'm sorry.

611
01:15:37,772 --> 01:15:41,604
Truth is, about all
I've got in life is my birds.

612
01:15:47,490 --> 01:15:50,941
What do you know about me,
Mrs Johnson?

613
01:15:51,077 --> 01:15:52,903
That you killed two men.

614
01:15:55,206 --> 01:15:58,290
- Any questions?
- No.

615
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:08,756
Stroud's Specifics. Well.

616
01:16:10,471 --> 01:16:13,757
- You hear a roll of the drums just then?
- Drums?

617
01:16:13,891 --> 01:16:16,512
- There was even a trombone there.
- Meaning what?

618
01:16:16,644 --> 01:16:19,314
The formation of our new company.

619
01:16:20,107 --> 01:16:22,858
You mean you made up
your mind just like that?

620
01:16:22,984 --> 01:16:26,270
One thing I've learned
is not to abuse time.

621
01:16:27,489 --> 01:16:32,780
I suggest we split everything right down
the middle, if that's all right with you.

622
01:16:32,911 --> 01:16:35,865
I never thought a business
could be set up this fast.

623
01:16:35,997 --> 01:16:39,283
- You can change your mind if you want.
- Not me.

624
01:16:41,712 --> 01:16:44,416
Yes, I guess so.

625
01:16:44,548 --> 01:16:45,793
I beg your pardon?

626
01:16:45,924 --> 01:16:49,542
I was just saying goodbye
to Shelbyville, Indiana.

627
01:16:49,678 --> 01:16:52,251
I'll be moving to Leavenworth.

628
01:16:52,389 --> 01:16:54,796
I've got to be near my factory.

629
01:16:57,227 --> 01:16:59,896
This is a big day for me, Mrs Johnson.

630
01:17:00,981 --> 01:17:03,817
I have a feeling you've brought me luck.

631
01:17:03,943 --> 01:17:06,399
- I hope so.
- Time's up.

632
01:17:08,156 --> 01:17:11,026
Before you go, would you do me a favour?

633
01:17:12,952 --> 01:17:15,408
Of course. What is it?

634
01:17:15,538 --> 01:17:21,576
Would it be too personal to...
to let me look through your purse?

635
01:17:24,630 --> 01:17:26,430
Go ahead.

636
01:17:40,146 --> 01:17:41,946
Lipstick?

637
01:17:57,247 --> 01:18:00,332
- Cigarette case?
- Powder compact.

638
01:18:02,419 --> 01:18:04,019
Oh, yes.

639
01:18:08,175 --> 01:18:11,461
What were you looking for?

640
01:18:11,595 --> 01:18:13,303
A hacksaw.

641
01:18:16,308 --> 01:18:20,637
Write me when you get ready to move.
I'll have my mother find a place for you.

642
01:18:20,771 --> 01:18:23,143
All right. Goodbye.

643
01:18:23,273 --> 01:18:25,313
So long, partner.

644
01:18:51,302 --> 01:18:54,256
Hey, Bob, get a load of this.

645
01:19:02,564 --> 01:19:05,233
Hey, you hear that, Bob?
What's that word?

646
01:19:06,943 --> 01:19:08,485
Congress.

647
01:19:08,611 --> 01:19:11,102
<i>The prison grapevine</i>
<i>hammered out the news</i>

648
01:19:11,239 --> 01:19:15,949
<i>that a Federal Bureau of Prisons</i>
<i>had been created by an act of Congress.</i>

649
01:19:16,078 --> 01:19:18,118
<i>Director... AJ MacLeod.</i>

650
01:19:19,832 --> 01:19:24,043
<i>The new warden who came to</i>
<i>Leavenworth was Albert Comstock.</i>

651
01:19:24,170 --> 01:19:28,298
<i>One of the first prisoners</i>
<i>he asked to see was Robert Stroud.</i>

652
01:19:30,926 --> 01:19:33,168
- Sit down, please.
- Thank you.

653
01:19:37,850 --> 01:19:42,311
You've heard about the formation
of the new Bureau of Prisons, of course.

654
01:19:42,438 --> 01:19:47,515
I have several directives from Washington
that will affect you personally.

655
01:19:47,651 --> 01:19:50,403
I wanted to read them to you myself.

656
01:19:50,529 --> 01:19:52,569
Go ahead, Warden.

657
01:19:54,700 --> 01:19:57,487
The first one states
that no pets of any kind

658
01:19:57,620 --> 01:20:00,538
will be allowed
in federal penitentiaries.

659
01:20:00,665 --> 01:20:06,371
The second directive forbids any inmate
to engage in any commercial enterprise.

660
01:20:06,505 --> 01:20:08,746
Do you know what that means?

661
01:20:08,882 --> 01:20:11,171
That means my birds.

662
01:20:11,301 --> 01:20:15,002
I'm sorry, Stroud.
I know how important they are to you.

663
01:20:16,306 --> 01:20:18,880
Nobody looks at my record, huh?

664
01:20:19,017 --> 01:20:21,935
15 years without a mark against me.

665
01:20:22,062 --> 01:20:26,060
- That don't mean billy-be-damned.
- You're exaggerating your importance.

666
01:20:26,191 --> 01:20:30,770
These directives weren't made just
for you. It applies to the entire system.

667
01:20:30,904 --> 01:20:35,649
Prisoners now have dogs, cats,
parrots, canary birds, even monkeys.

668
01:20:35,784 --> 01:20:39,734
It's bad sanitation.
Feeding becomes a big problem.

669
01:20:39,871 --> 01:20:45,163
It creates feuds among inmates.
Other prisoners complain of lice and fleas.

670
01:20:45,294 --> 01:20:48,331
The situation simply has to be cleaned up.

671
01:20:48,464 --> 01:20:52,592
You have 60 days to get rid of your aviary.
That's all, Stroud.

672
01:21:05,898 --> 01:21:08,650
I never thought Uncle Sam
would go back on his word.

673
01:21:08,776 --> 01:21:10,816
Meaning what?

674
01:21:11,988 --> 01:21:16,864
There's been an understanding between
the government and me, for 11 years,

675
01:21:16,993 --> 01:21:19,151
that I could raise my birds.

676
01:21:19,287 --> 01:21:21,445
That pledge has been broken.

677
01:21:21,581 --> 01:21:26,243
- As far as I'm concerned, all bets are off.
- That sounds like a threat.

678
01:21:26,377 --> 01:21:30,376
Warden, you just got through
tellin' me that I ain't very important.

679
01:21:30,507 --> 01:21:34,422
How could I threaten a big,
powerful Washington bureau?

680
01:21:37,306 --> 01:21:39,879
I've been doin' a lot of thinkin', Mother.

681
01:21:40,017 --> 01:21:42,259
I have a plan, and it might work.

682
01:21:43,854 --> 01:21:45,894
What kind of a plan?

683
01:21:46,982 --> 01:21:50,066
Do you remember how
you saved my neck in 1920?

684
01:21:51,737 --> 01:21:55,437
- Yes, but I don't see...
- Publicity. That's what did it.

685
01:21:56,408 --> 01:21:58,068
I don't think I follow you.

686
01:21:58,202 --> 01:22:02,116
How many bird owners
know I'm a convict?

687
01:22:03,540 --> 01:22:06,992
- Just a few.
- Then we'll tell 'em.

688
01:22:07,127 --> 01:22:10,294
We'll tell 'em how
they're gonna take my birds away.

689
01:22:10,422 --> 01:22:14,468
We'll write to newspapers,
radio stations, commentators, columnists,

690
01:22:14,594 --> 01:22:16,468
bird clubs, magazines.

691
01:22:16,596 --> 01:22:20,297
We'll have people angry
from coast to coast.

692
01:22:20,433 --> 01:22:23,304
Excellent, Robbie. Excellent.

693
01:22:23,436 --> 01:22:25,892
We'll drive 'em right down the pike.

694
01:22:27,816 --> 01:22:30,389
It'll be just like it was in the old days.

695
01:22:30,527 --> 01:22:34,192
Just the two of us together,
fighting the world.

696
01:22:36,074 --> 01:22:39,906
I've just been to see Bob,
and I smuggled out this.

697
01:22:40,036 --> 01:22:42,706
It's instructions for the campaign.

698
01:22:44,874 --> 01:22:47,662
Why should he give you this material?

699
01:22:47,794 --> 01:22:50,878
The kind of thing he usually
entrusts to his mother.

700
01:22:51,005 --> 01:22:53,128
Well, I don't know.

701
01:22:53,258 --> 01:22:57,968
I guess that time was short.
It doesn't really matter, does it?

702
01:22:58,097 --> 01:23:02,510
There's a great deal of copying
to be done. You'll follow my directions.

703
01:23:02,643 --> 01:23:04,102
Yes, ma'am.

704
01:23:04,228 --> 01:23:09,353
Start with letters to the bird clubs.
When you've finished I'll assign you more.

705
01:23:09,483 --> 01:23:10,681
Yes, ma'am.

706
01:23:11,652 --> 01:23:16,148
Here it is. Right here on the second page
of the <i>Kansas City Star.</i>

707
01:23:16,282 --> 01:23:18,321
- Here.
- Oh, yes.

708
01:23:21,287 --> 01:23:23,326
That's not enough.

709
01:23:23,914 --> 01:23:28,956
I want the front page. We're ready now
for the next step of our campaign.

710
01:23:29,086 --> 01:23:31,624
- You got another idea?
- Yes, and it's dynamite.

711
01:23:31,756 --> 01:23:34,211
I came across it in an old law book.

712
01:23:34,759 --> 01:23:36,965
Stell, you can save my neck.

713
01:23:37,094 --> 01:23:40,049
How? Bob, you know I'd do anything.

714
01:23:40,182 --> 01:23:42,933
Now, listen, how would you
like to marry me?

715
01:23:50,442 --> 01:23:54,985
Let me understand you, now. Are you
trying to tell me that you married a man

716
01:23:55,113 --> 01:23:59,656
serving a life term in solitary
at Leavenworth penitentiary?

717
01:23:59,785 --> 01:24:02,240
Yes, sir. Yesterday.

718
01:24:02,371 --> 01:24:05,574
And where did the ceremony take place?

719
01:24:05,707 --> 01:24:07,747
At the penitentiary.

720
01:24:08,752 --> 01:24:11,539
By the prison chaplain, no doubt?

721
01:24:11,671 --> 01:24:15,171
No, sir. It was a civil ceremony.

722
01:24:16,551 --> 01:24:19,303
Well, go ahead. I've listened this far.

723
01:24:19,429 --> 01:24:21,718
Well, you see...

724
01:24:21,848 --> 01:24:22,848
Yes?

725
01:24:24,435 --> 01:24:28,303
You see, under the laws of the Treaty
of Paris and the Louisiana Purchase,

726
01:24:28,439 --> 01:24:33,350
all a man and woman had to do to be
legally married was to sign a declaration.

727
01:24:33,486 --> 01:24:35,977
You see, Leavenworth
is still federal property

728
01:24:36,114 --> 01:24:40,028
and is therefore immune to
the laws of the state of Kansas.

729
01:24:44,288 --> 01:24:47,159
It's all here, sir, if you want to read it.

730
01:24:53,131 --> 01:24:57,709
<i>Stroud got his front page - and with</i>
<i>a bang heard all the way to Washington.</i>

731
01:24:57,844 --> 01:25:01,972
<i>Result... one of the strangest</i>
<i>conferences in prison history.</i>

732
01:25:14,695 --> 01:25:17,150
The warden's on his way right now.

733
01:25:33,756 --> 01:25:35,795
- Hello, Bob.
- Hello, Harvey.

734
01:25:44,725 --> 01:25:48,639
Well, you've succeeded in creating
quite a little flurry with your birds.

735
01:25:48,771 --> 01:25:53,480
Just an inmate protecting his rights.
Would you like to sit down?

736
01:25:53,610 --> 01:25:55,649
Yes, thanks.

737
01:26:00,450 --> 01:26:05,871
Bob... I've been sent here as a delegate
of the bureau to make you an offer.

738
01:26:05,997 --> 01:26:08,749
That's what I've been waiting for.

739
01:26:08,875 --> 01:26:13,502
Now the bureau is willing to let you
keep your birds. You can even sell 'em.

740
01:26:13,630 --> 01:26:16,335
Now this is their official proposal.

741
01:26:16,466 --> 01:26:19,383
You can continue
to raise and sell the birds,

742
01:26:19,511 --> 01:26:23,045
but the profits will be turned over
to the prison welfare fund,

743
01:26:23,181 --> 01:26:26,515
and you will receive a salary
in the form of a share of the profits.

744
01:26:26,643 --> 01:26:28,682
10 dollars a month.

745
01:26:30,897 --> 01:26:35,642
I consider that quite a generous offer
under the circumstances.

746
01:26:35,777 --> 01:26:40,523
Frankly, it's more than I would
have offered, had I the authority.

747
01:26:43,661 --> 01:26:45,700
Well, Stroud?

748
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,040
Let me see if I understand you.

749
01:26:53,546 --> 01:26:59,501
You're proposing that the US government
go into the canary-bird business.

750
01:26:59,635 --> 01:27:02,173
That's against private enterprise.

751
01:27:02,304 --> 01:27:04,546
You sound like a Bolshevik, Harvey.

752
01:27:04,682 --> 01:27:07,718
- You have no legal right to raise canaries.
- I know.

753
01:27:07,852 --> 01:27:12,348
Rule 60 of the Federal Bureau of Prisons
Manual: "An inmate cannot be permitted

754
01:27:12,481 --> 01:27:15,815
to operate a business, no matter
how legitimate, while in prison."

755
01:27:15,943 --> 01:27:18,066
- That right?
- You quoted it correctly.

756
01:27:18,195 --> 01:27:20,568
That's what I thought.

757
01:27:20,699 --> 01:27:22,738
That's why I'm confused.

758
01:27:23,744 --> 01:27:26,069
The rule says I can't have a business.

759
01:27:26,204 --> 01:27:29,289
You say I can, provided
I give you the profits.

760
01:27:30,375 --> 01:27:34,076
That's circumventing regulations.
It's not like you.

761
01:27:35,255 --> 01:27:40,332
Mr Shoemaker came to try to work out
a plan so you can keep your blasted birds.

762
01:27:40,469 --> 01:27:42,757
Don't con an old con, Warden.

763
01:27:42,888 --> 01:27:45,675
He came because of public opinion,
and you know it.

764
01:27:45,807 --> 01:27:48,049
50,000 signatures on a petition.

765
01:27:48,185 --> 01:27:51,269
Congressmen jumping
all over MacLeod's back.

766
01:27:54,816 --> 01:27:57,687
I think I got you over a barrel, Harvey.

767
01:27:59,821 --> 01:28:02,395
Is that your last word?

768
01:28:02,532 --> 01:28:04,905
I could use more room.

769
01:28:05,036 --> 01:28:07,075
For my birds.

770
01:28:09,791 --> 01:28:13,705
I'll report the minutes
of our conference to Mr MacLeod.

771
01:28:15,296 --> 01:28:17,336
That's all, Comstock.

772
01:28:27,016 --> 01:28:29,472
Have a nice trip back to Washington.

773
01:28:30,436 --> 01:28:32,892
I'm not going back to Washington.

774
01:28:33,815 --> 01:28:37,100
I'm heading a new penitentiary. Alcatraz.

775
01:28:40,613 --> 01:28:42,902
That's a big job, Harvey.

776
01:28:43,032 --> 01:28:45,072
I wish you luck.

777
01:28:47,829 --> 01:28:49,829
Thank you.

778
01:28:52,668 --> 01:28:56,997
Keep one thing in mind, Bob.
The public has a short memory.

779
01:29:01,468 --> 01:29:03,461
Hello, Mother. Here, sit ye down.

780
01:29:05,013 --> 01:29:07,683
You hear that? You know what that is?

781
01:29:09,476 --> 01:29:13,059
It's a jackhammer.
And do you know what it's doin'?

782
01:29:13,188 --> 01:29:17,518
- No, I haven't been informed as yet.
- They're tearing down the wall of my cell.

783
01:29:17,651 --> 01:29:20,272
And cuttin' through
a doorway into the next one.

784
01:29:20,404 --> 01:29:23,488
- I'm gonna have two cells for my birds.
- How nice.

785
01:29:23,615 --> 01:29:25,738
I can keep 'em and I can sell 'em.

786
01:29:25,868 --> 01:29:30,826
I get larger quarters and even some
laboratory equipment. How about that?

787
01:29:33,209 --> 01:29:37,752
Two women and a con,
and we whipped the bureau to a standstill.

788
01:29:38,923 --> 01:29:40,963
That's very good news indeed.

789
01:29:42,594 --> 01:29:47,137
Of course, there was a time
when I would have been the first to know.

790
01:29:47,265 --> 01:29:50,017
It's a real victory, Mother.

791
01:29:50,143 --> 01:29:52,599
And I got you and Stell to thank.

792
01:29:55,106 --> 01:29:57,146
Sit down, Robbie.

793
01:30:02,530 --> 01:30:05,816
- I want to talk to you about her.
- About Stella?

794
01:30:05,950 --> 01:30:10,493
Your association with her
will bring you nothing but trouble.

795
01:30:12,040 --> 01:30:13,664
I don't know what you mean.

796
01:30:13,792 --> 01:30:17,837
She's the wrong kind of a woman
for you to align yourself with.

797
01:30:21,634 --> 01:30:25,003
She's worked her heart out for me.
She saved my bacon.

798
01:30:25,137 --> 01:30:29,265
All right. She was of use temporarily,
but she's served her purpose.

799
01:30:29,392 --> 01:30:32,891
And now if you'll follow my advice,
you'll get rid of her.

800
01:30:39,402 --> 01:30:42,402
I don't understand
what you're talkin' about, Mom.

801
01:30:42,530 --> 01:30:44,569
She's my wife.

802
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:49,616
Your trouble began with
that other woman in Alaska.

803
01:30:50,788 --> 01:30:53,279
She's the same kind of a woman.

804
01:30:53,999 --> 01:30:58,543
- She's a common adventuress.
- Don't say things like that, Mother.

805
01:31:00,423 --> 01:31:03,294
She's a good woman. And she's kind.

806
01:31:04,803 --> 01:31:07,211
And she'd do anything in the world for me.

807
01:31:07,347 --> 01:31:09,387
It's disaster, Robbie.

808
01:31:10,851 --> 01:31:13,721
She'll bring you nothing but heartache.

809
01:31:15,981 --> 01:31:18,686
Besides, all she wanted was the publicity.

810
01:31:22,112 --> 01:31:25,812
Mother... you can't be serious.

811
01:31:32,748 --> 01:31:34,906
I can't believe this is happening.

812
01:31:42,257 --> 01:31:45,342
Give her up, Robbie. Forget her.

813
01:32:09,535 --> 01:32:13,319
You act as though
you wanted me here for all time.

814
01:32:13,456 --> 01:32:15,994
With you as my only outside connection.

815
01:32:19,796 --> 01:32:21,196
Then...

816
01:32:22,090 --> 01:32:26,752
Then you choose her
instead of your own mother?

817
01:32:27,637 --> 01:32:29,677
Don't say any more, Mother.

818
01:32:30,474 --> 01:32:31,874
Please.

819
01:32:37,564 --> 01:32:41,265
That's your decision? To desert me?

820
01:32:53,288 --> 01:32:58,912
Mrs Stroud? My name is Peterson.
I'm a reporter from the <i>Kansas City Star.</i>

821
01:32:59,044 --> 01:33:02,828
My paper wants a follow-up story
on your son's marriage.

822
01:33:02,965 --> 01:33:04,625
No comment.

823
01:33:04,758 --> 01:33:08,803
Well, does this so-called marriage
come as a surprise to you, Mrs Stroud?

824
01:33:08,929 --> 01:33:11,420
I knew nothing of it.

825
01:33:11,557 --> 01:33:13,597
Your son's parole hearing is coming up.

826
01:33:13,727 --> 01:33:16,644
Who'll lead the fight this time?
You or Stella Johnson?

827
01:33:16,771 --> 01:33:18,811
There will be no fight.

828
01:33:21,234 --> 01:33:25,398
Wait a minute, Mrs Stroud.
What do you mean, there'll be no fight?

829
01:33:29,743 --> 01:33:31,782
Just what does that mean?

830
01:33:34,038 --> 01:33:36,494
My son is where he belongs.

831
01:33:37,292 --> 01:33:41,503
I shall do nothing to obtain
his release from the penitentiary.

832
01:33:41,629 --> 01:33:44,417
And this is for quotation?

833
01:33:44,549 --> 01:33:47,170
I know he's safe where he is.

834
01:33:47,302 --> 01:33:52,260
I wanna be sure. Are you saying
you'd rather have him in there than free?

835
01:33:52,390 --> 01:33:55,060
You now oppose your own son's parole?

836
01:33:57,188 --> 01:33:59,643
I'm doing it for his own good.

837
01:34:02,109 --> 01:34:06,652
Well, Bob, you're the first con
in history that ever had two cells.

838
01:34:11,035 --> 01:34:13,074
Gonna be great for the birds.

839
01:34:19,168 --> 01:34:24,126
It's in all the papers. I can't understand
how she could turn on you that way.

840
01:34:25,883 --> 01:34:29,382
Do you know what a mother tiger
does when she's upset?

841
01:34:30,137 --> 01:34:32,177
She eats her young.

842
01:34:40,106 --> 01:34:43,606
Maybe I could talk to your old lady,
try and fix it up.

843
01:34:44,194 --> 01:34:46,650
I guarantee she'll change her mind.

844
01:34:55,914 --> 01:34:56,914
Bob!

845
01:35:10,262 --> 01:35:12,717
Far as I'm concerned, she's dead.

846
01:35:24,860 --> 01:35:26,900
I gotta go make my bed check.

847
01:35:52,472 --> 01:35:54,963
You know what this is, friends?

848
01:35:55,099 --> 01:35:57,139
This is 180-proof alcohol.

849
01:36:00,521 --> 01:36:03,641
I'm gonna make me
a Leavenworth cocktail.

850
01:36:03,775 --> 01:36:06,859
You watch now.
You're gonna see me get drunk.

851
01:36:33,972 --> 01:36:36,012
Fly, my avian friends.

852
01:36:38,644 --> 01:36:41,099
I give you the illusion of freedom.

853
01:36:43,482 --> 01:36:45,282
Enjoy it.

854
01:37:18,059 --> 01:37:20,099
Go ahead, open it.

855
01:37:23,606 --> 01:37:25,017
Go ahead.

856
01:38:06,692 --> 01:38:11,853
Picked it up last night in a hockshop.
Thought you might get a kick out of it.

857
01:38:31,301 --> 01:38:34,385
Why don't you look at somethin',
see if it works?

858
01:38:49,403 --> 01:38:54,148
Mr Ransom, you sure are a darlin' man!

859
01:38:55,700 --> 01:38:57,740
Keep both eyes open.

860
01:38:57,869 --> 01:39:01,997
After a while, you'll see only
through the eye of the eyepiece.

861
01:39:14,137 --> 01:39:16,425
That's the ticket.

862
01:39:16,931 --> 01:39:20,976
<i> For Stroud, that microscope</i>
<i>was the lantern he had been waiting for</i>

863
01:39:21,102 --> 01:39:26,441
<i>to light his way into the marvellous</i>
<i>and exacting truth of scientific research.</i>

864
01:39:26,566 --> 01:39:28,642
<i>His object... the bird.</i>

865
01:39:28,776 --> 01:39:34,980
<i>His tools... curiosity, dedication,</i>
<i>and the nerve of a riverboat gambler,</i>

866
01:39:35,116 --> 01:39:39,279
<i>as he ripped into studies which read like</i>
<i>the curriculum of a medical university.</i>

867
01:39:39,412 --> 01:39:43,741
<i>Cytology, morphology, biochemistry.</i>

868
01:39:45,084 --> 01:39:47,789
<i>Stroud decided he was</i>
<i>equipped to launch a project</i>

869
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:50,210
<i>he had long dreamed about -

870
01:39:50,340 --> 01:39:53,211
<i>a definitive work on the diseases of birds.</i>

871
01:39:54,219 --> 01:39:58,466
<i>He had found cures for diseases</i>
<i>he could hardly pronounce,</i>

872
01:39:58,599 --> 01:40:04,518
<i>like haemorrhagic septicaemia, bird</i>
<i>diphtheria, aspergillosis, avian cholera.</i>

873
01:40:04,646 --> 01:40:08,430
<i>He even found a specific</i>
<i>for fowl paralysis,</i>

874
01:40:08,567 --> 01:40:13,110
<i>thereby saving poultry ranches</i>
<i>the lives of thousands of chickens.</i>

875
01:40:14,907 --> 01:40:20,149
<i>The title of his book was "Stroud's</i>
<i>Digest of the Diseases of Birds".</i>

876
01:40:20,287 --> 01:40:22,825
<i>Its contents established beyond doubt</i>

877
01:40:22,956 --> 01:40:27,914
<i>that the ageing prisoner was</i>
<i>the world's foremost authority in his field.</i>

878
01:40:29,505 --> 01:40:32,375
<i>The book took seven years to complete.</i>

879
01:40:34,469 --> 01:40:37,672
I want your scientific opinion
about this book of Stroud's.

880
01:40:37,806 --> 01:40:40,676
Is it baloney or does it
amount to anything?

881
01:40:45,021 --> 01:40:47,061
Well, Doctor?

882
01:40:48,191 --> 01:40:50,647
It's hardly what you'd call baloney.

883
01:40:51,903 --> 01:40:57,277
It's a highly scientific study
of the pathology - diseases - of birds.

884
01:40:58,243 --> 01:41:01,694
You think Stroud's
quite a man, don't you?

885
01:41:01,830 --> 01:41:04,202
I think he's a genius.

886
01:41:04,332 --> 01:41:07,250
Why? Just because
he's written a book about birds?

887
01:41:07,377 --> 01:41:09,832
No. No, not because of that.

888
01:41:09,963 --> 01:41:13,248
Because, with only
a third-grade education,

889
01:41:14,300 --> 01:41:18,002
he's become expert
in subjects like haematology -

890
01:41:18,973 --> 01:41:20,847
that's blood.

891
01:41:20,975 --> 01:41:23,845
Histology - tissue. Anatomy.

892
01:41:25,688 --> 01:41:30,184
Studies tough enough with an instructor
in college, but self-taught in a cell,

893
01:41:30,317 --> 01:41:33,022
an accomplishment
that staggers imagination.

894
01:41:33,154 --> 01:41:35,609
He's smart. He has a high IQ.

895
01:41:37,074 --> 01:41:39,779
He's more than that. He's dedicated.

896
01:41:39,910 --> 01:41:43,160
He's spent over 3,000 hours
at that microscope of his,

897
01:41:43,289 --> 01:41:46,989
made hundreds of drawings,
over 5,000 tissue sections.

898
01:41:47,835 --> 01:41:51,251
He has one of the finest collections
of slides on birds in existence.

899
01:41:51,380 --> 01:41:56,375
Knows more about avian anatomy
and pathology than any man alive.

900
01:41:56,510 --> 01:41:59,844
OK. I'll recommend his book
go to the publisher's.

901
01:41:59,972 --> 01:42:02,429
Make the bird-lovers happy.

902
01:42:06,021 --> 01:42:10,599
If Stroud's paroled and gets a laboratory,
there's no telling what he might do.

903
01:42:10,734 --> 01:42:13,735
He should be working on
human diseases, not birds'.

904
01:42:13,862 --> 01:42:16,946
Paroled? Not much chance of that.

905
01:42:18,992 --> 01:42:21,613
I thought his record was good.

906
01:42:21,745 --> 01:42:23,784
Not in the eyes of the bureau.

907
01:42:23,914 --> 01:42:27,781
His attitude is poor.
He thinks he's a world unto himself,

908
01:42:27,918 --> 01:42:31,785
like we were his own
personal quartermaster corps.

909
01:42:31,922 --> 01:42:35,622
Chemicals,
laboratory equipment, birdseed.

910
01:42:36,593 --> 01:42:41,385
Now he's demanding 25lbs of ice
every day. It's got to stop someplace.

911
01:42:41,515 --> 01:42:44,599
I'd give him 500lbs of ice
a day if he wanted it.

912
01:42:45,435 --> 01:42:47,476
You would, huh?

913
01:42:48,314 --> 01:42:51,185
I wonder if the bureau
isn't afraid of Stroud.

914
01:42:51,317 --> 01:42:55,397
Afraid to let the public know what kind of
a brain they're keeping locked up here.

915
01:42:55,530 --> 01:42:58,899
Doctor, we're keeping
a killer locked up here.

916
01:42:59,033 --> 01:43:01,358
Don't forget it.

917
01:43:01,744 --> 01:43:05,196
I heard from that professor,
the one at the university of Kansas.

918
01:43:05,331 --> 01:43:09,329
He said if I were out, I might have
a good chance to get a research grant.

919
01:43:09,460 --> 01:43:12,461
- What's that?
- Well, they pay you to do research.

920
01:43:12,588 --> 01:43:15,258
Bob! But that's wonderful!

921
01:43:15,383 --> 01:43:18,337
Only one drawback - gettin' out.

922
01:43:18,469 --> 01:43:21,885
Well, how can the parole board
turn you down now?

923
01:43:22,014 --> 01:43:26,427
Boy, they talk about rehabilitation.
This book and the cures you discovered...

924
01:43:26,561 --> 01:43:28,849
What do they want?

925
01:43:28,980 --> 01:43:33,726
I wish you were on that board, Stell.
I'd be strollin' down the avenue right now.

926
01:43:33,861 --> 01:43:38,523
But let's not make any plans.
I've seen too many of 'em go up in smoke.

927
01:43:38,657 --> 01:43:42,406
You still won't let yourself
think about getting out, will you?

928
01:43:42,536 --> 01:43:45,620
Bob, what's wrong with
having a little faith?

929
01:43:49,334 --> 01:43:51,790
You're always bringing me new words.

930
01:43:53,130 --> 01:43:55,336
Like "love" and "faith".

931
01:43:55,466 --> 01:43:59,380
You're a wonderful man.
You've done some great things.

932
01:43:59,511 --> 01:44:03,461
I have faith that the parole board
will see how good you are.

933
01:44:03,599 --> 01:44:08,973
Golly, you just can't go on thinking that
you're gonna be here the rest of your life.

934
01:44:22,160 --> 01:44:27,664
All right, honey. I'll bring faith
into my cell tonight and entertain it.

935
01:44:27,791 --> 01:44:29,830
Just for the soup course.

936
01:44:32,045 --> 01:44:35,745
But don't you start buying me
any new neckties yet, OK?

937
01:44:37,634 --> 01:44:39,673
You look pretty today.

938
01:44:59,657 --> 01:45:01,696
Bob, come on, wake up.

939
01:45:01,826 --> 01:45:03,865
Bob, wake up. Come on. Get up.

940
01:45:04,703 --> 01:45:06,743
What's up, Bull?

941
01:45:07,706 --> 01:45:09,746
Your transfer orders.

942
01:45:27,435 --> 01:45:29,226
Alcatraz.

943
01:45:32,273 --> 01:45:34,312
Here. Better get dressed.

944
01:45:36,777 --> 01:45:39,862
- Dressed?
- Now. They're on their way down.

945
01:45:57,007 --> 01:45:59,046
All right, let's go.

946
01:46:05,891 --> 01:46:08,975
- Why this time of night?
- Orders. Step on it.

947
01:46:14,816 --> 01:46:18,316
What about my equipment? My birds?

948
01:46:18,445 --> 01:46:23,605
Our instructions are you walk outta here
with just the clothes you have on.

949
01:46:26,871 --> 01:46:30,322
I got a sick bird in there. Can I fix it?

950
01:46:31,667 --> 01:46:33,707
Of course you can.

951
01:46:51,687 --> 01:46:53,727
Listen to me, Bull.

952
01:46:58,820 --> 01:47:00,859
I want you to talk to Stella.

953
01:47:05,159 --> 01:47:07,829
I want you to tell her not to follow me.

954
01:47:15,963 --> 01:47:18,169
Under no conditions.

955
01:47:19,091 --> 01:47:21,130
Understand?

956
01:47:24,388 --> 01:47:29,346
You better grab that pension and beat it,
before these walls get to ya.

957
01:47:32,855 --> 01:47:34,894
I'll try and write.

958
01:47:35,941 --> 01:47:40,069
Don't waste your time grieving over me.
When it's cut, it's cut.

959
01:47:51,331 --> 01:47:53,371
So long, friend.

960
01:47:57,088 --> 01:47:59,128
Merry Christmas, boys.

961
01:47:59,883 --> 01:48:01,922
I could use a rest.

962
01:49:33,395 --> 01:49:34,339
Yes?

963
01:49:34,439 --> 01:49:37,521
Prisoner Stroud
completed processing, sir.

964
01:49:37,649 --> 01:49:39,649
Thank you.

965
01:49:49,870 --> 01:49:53,737
Dog block. Solitary again, hm?

966
01:49:53,874 --> 01:49:56,958
It's not called solitary here. Segregation.

967
01:49:59,004 --> 01:50:01,043
Interesting name.

968
01:50:16,355 --> 01:50:19,025
- Silence rule?
- Strictly enforced.

969
01:50:31,746 --> 01:50:33,785
Hello, Bob.

970
01:50:35,875 --> 01:50:39,161
- How are you, Harvey?
- Pretty good for an old man.

971
01:50:40,630 --> 01:50:42,669
You're looking well.

972
01:50:46,385 --> 01:50:49,552
How was your trip out?
Not too unpleasant, I hope.

973
01:50:49,680 --> 01:50:52,552
Well, I've always enjoyed travelling.

974
01:50:54,853 --> 01:50:58,269
It's quite an establishment
you've got here.

975
01:50:58,398 --> 01:51:00,438
Yes, it has its good points.

976
01:51:05,030 --> 01:51:08,114
It's modern, well-heated, clean.

977
01:51:09,660 --> 01:51:13,527
First thing I noticed. Almost antiseptic.

978
01:51:13,664 --> 01:51:16,333
Yeah, you'll find no cockroaches here.

979
01:51:18,127 --> 01:51:21,661
We have linoleum on
all the floors of the cells.

980
01:51:21,839 --> 01:51:25,539
Coming over on the launch,
I saw some children playing.

981
01:51:27,803 --> 01:51:31,338
They belong to the guards
and all the other personnel.

982
01:51:31,473 --> 01:51:33,964
We all live on the Rock, too.

983
01:51:34,101 --> 01:51:36,344
Interesting, isn't it?

984
01:51:36,479 --> 01:51:38,935
The game of tag never grows old.

985
01:51:42,193 --> 01:51:45,064
Doesn't seem so long ago
I played it myself.

986
01:51:49,075 --> 01:51:52,575
I got a good report on you
from Leavenworth, Bob.

987
01:51:52,704 --> 01:51:56,404
And I'm satisfied you'll make
the adjustment here.

988
01:51:56,541 --> 01:51:59,210
Now, your orders call for segregation.

989
01:52:00,378 --> 01:52:04,672
But I think if you toe the mark,
eventually we can improve on that,

990
01:52:04,799 --> 01:52:07,670
make things a little more pleasant for you.

991
01:52:15,977 --> 01:52:20,854
My office is always open. If you're not
treated right, just let me know.

992
01:52:20,983 --> 01:52:23,439
Do the children enjoy living here?

993
01:52:26,363 --> 01:52:29,448
I don't suppose any of us
truly enjoy living on this island.

994
01:52:29,575 --> 01:52:32,031
It wasn't designed for pleasure.

995
01:52:42,630 --> 01:52:44,030
Stroud.

996
01:52:44,882 --> 01:52:47,282
Hey, Stroud.

997
01:53:03,985 --> 01:53:04,985
Feto.

998
01:53:06,613 --> 01:53:08,155
Feto Gomez.

999
01:53:08,281 --> 01:53:10,951
You old buzzard. I heard you was comin'.

1000
01:53:23,755 --> 01:53:28,631
- It's good to see ya. How do you feel?
- Still squeakin' by.

1001
01:53:28,760 --> 01:53:30,800
Remember the birds? Huh?

1002
01:53:31,555 --> 01:53:34,390
Ape and Jackie.
Them was good times, you know.

1003
01:53:34,516 --> 01:53:37,185
They sure were. Gee, you look good.

1004
01:53:42,983 --> 01:53:46,683
I still figure you stole
them baby canaries from me.

1005
01:53:46,820 --> 01:53:50,190
Well, you know me, Feto.
I'm just an old thief.

1006
01:53:54,746 --> 01:53:57,533
Have you seen the Shoemaker lately?

1007
01:53:58,750 --> 01:54:00,707
He met me at the barn door.

1008
01:54:08,092 --> 01:54:10,762
Well, he ain't such a bad old guy.

1009
01:54:10,887 --> 01:54:13,342
We been cutting it pretty good lately.

1010
01:54:14,015 --> 01:54:16,007
He made me trusty.

1011
01:54:16,142 --> 01:54:18,016
- Trusty?
- Sure.

1012
01:54:18,144 --> 01:54:23,304
No use beatin' your head up against the
wall. I should've wised up a long time ago.

1013
01:54:24,609 --> 01:54:26,732
I been flyin' right lately,

1014
01:54:26,861 --> 01:54:30,194
because my parole
comes up again in November,

1015
01:54:30,323 --> 01:54:34,986
and I'm gonna hit those bricks
before I kick the bucket, you see?

1016
01:54:35,120 --> 01:54:38,572
Sure. Sure, I understand, Feto.

1017
01:55:01,021 --> 01:55:03,061
You still go for the mince pie?

1018
01:55:04,817 --> 01:55:09,977
I can do you a lot of good, because I'm
the head man with the steam table here.

1019
01:55:11,532 --> 01:55:17,618
And old Feto Gomez can sneak you two,

1020
01:55:17,747 --> 01:55:20,417
maybe even three pieces every so often.

1021
01:55:26,339 --> 01:55:28,581
- Feto.
- Yeah?

1022
01:55:29,467 --> 01:55:32,302
- How much time you done?
- Time?

1023
01:55:32,429 --> 01:55:35,133
Yeah. How much time? Altogether?

1024
01:55:37,100 --> 01:55:39,009
I don't know.

1025
01:55:39,144 --> 01:55:41,183
Let me recollect.

1026
01:55:43,273 --> 01:55:45,312
I knocked off four at Atlanta.

1027
01:55:46,401 --> 01:55:48,440
I did three at Juliet.

1028
01:55:50,238 --> 01:55:53,856
And then I did that ten-spot
with you at Leavenworth.

1029
01:55:53,992 --> 01:55:56,447
And then I was on the street for four.

1030
01:55:56,578 --> 01:55:58,950
And then I been here for six.

1031
01:55:59,080 --> 01:56:01,751
- How much is that?
- 23.

1032
01:56:01,876 --> 01:56:02,876
Yeah.

1033
01:56:04,086 --> 01:56:08,131
- Why do you wanna know, Bob?
- Nothin'. I just wondered.

1034
01:56:08,257 --> 01:56:11,507
- What's all the gabbin', Gomez?
- Nothin', sir.

1035
01:56:11,635 --> 01:56:15,135
The prisoner just wanted
some more meat.

1036
01:56:16,891 --> 01:56:19,678
No chance, Stroud. No extra portions.

1037
01:56:19,810 --> 01:56:23,511
Everybody gets treated the same here,
you understand?

1038
01:56:41,999 --> 01:56:44,456
- Bob.
- I'm gonna wallop you today.

1039
01:56:50,425 --> 01:56:53,212
Congratulations on
the publication of your book.

1040
01:56:53,345 --> 01:56:56,050
Yeah, it's a honey. It should sell big.

1041
01:56:56,181 --> 01:57:00,179
But that's all behind me now.
I've started writin' a new book.

1042
01:57:00,310 --> 01:57:04,806
The history of federal prisons from 1790
up to the formation of the bureau.

1043
01:57:04,940 --> 01:57:07,691
A story about caged men
rather than birds.

1044
01:57:07,818 --> 01:57:10,356
What prison does to 'em.

1045
01:57:10,487 --> 01:57:13,156
Got the idea from seein' an old friend.

1046
01:57:14,533 --> 01:57:18,945
- It's an ambitious undertaking, Bob.
- It'll knock the public cold.

1047
01:57:19,079 --> 01:57:21,914
Graft, corruption,

1048
01:57:22,040 --> 01:57:24,496
stupidity, sadism.

1049
01:57:25,877 --> 01:57:28,665
All the elements
of a best seller, eh, Father?

1050
01:57:28,798 --> 01:57:32,167
- It's a story that needs telling.
- And how!

1051
01:57:32,301 --> 01:57:37,213
You realise, of course,
it involves a certain element of risk.

1052
01:57:38,891 --> 01:57:40,931
I do indeed.

1053
01:57:41,060 --> 01:57:43,100
But you know somethin'?

1054
01:57:44,647 --> 01:57:48,479
When you've lived in these manure piles
for over 30 years, as I have,

1055
01:57:48,609 --> 01:57:51,694
you come to know everything's a risk.

1056
01:57:51,821 --> 01:57:53,860
Your serve.

1057
01:57:56,826 --> 01:57:59,696
- I wish you luck.
- It's worth the gamble.

1058
01:58:43,916 --> 01:58:46,585
I'm confiscating this manuscript, Bob.

1059
01:58:47,252 --> 01:58:49,328
Have you read it?

1060
01:58:49,463 --> 01:58:54,208
Enough to realise that it's a blast
at the entire penal system.

1061
01:58:54,343 --> 01:58:56,383
You're in serious trouble.

1062
01:58:57,430 --> 01:59:01,048
The bureau has known for months
what you were writing.

1063
01:59:01,184 --> 01:59:03,853
You haven't told me what you think of it.

1064
01:59:10,110 --> 01:59:12,149
I resent this personally.

1065
01:59:13,822 --> 01:59:16,858
I stand high in my profession,

1066
01:59:16,991 --> 01:59:19,696
and I believe I've earned that esteem.

1067
01:59:19,828 --> 01:59:23,197
I am proud of the advances
that I have helped to inaugurate.

1068
01:59:23,331 --> 01:59:26,498
Think back to the old times.
Leg irons, carrying the iron ball,

1069
01:59:26,626 --> 01:59:30,873
stripes, corporal punishment,
indefinite periods in the hole.

1070
01:59:31,005 --> 01:59:34,172
I have been instrumental
in abolishing that kind of treatment.

1071
01:59:34,300 --> 01:59:36,340
Yes, that's true, Harvey.

1072
01:59:37,095 --> 01:59:42,719
Furthermore, you completely ignore my
fight for a constructive work programme.

1073
01:59:42,852 --> 01:59:46,552
Like making belt buckles,
or running a drill press?

1074
01:59:48,774 --> 01:59:49,974
I see.

1075
01:59:50,943 --> 01:59:55,901
My entire career has been for nothing.
I'm all wrong and you're all right.

1076
01:59:56,949 --> 02:00:01,907
I'm not talking about one tree, Harvey.
I'm talking about the whole forest.

1077
02:00:02,037 --> 02:00:05,241
I haven't spent most of my life
behind bars for nothing.

1078
02:00:05,374 --> 02:00:10,332
I've reached conclusions about penology,
and a couple of them may be valid.

1079
02:00:13,090 --> 02:00:16,590
When you first came here,
I thought you were changed.

1080
02:00:19,013 --> 02:00:23,342
I was even planning to return you
to the general prison population.

1081
02:00:25,812 --> 02:00:29,561
And now this. Well,
you're not gonna get away with it.

1082
02:00:30,358 --> 02:00:35,982
The bureau has suggested privileges be
suspended. You know what that means.

1083
02:00:36,114 --> 02:00:40,159
You know better than try to frighten me,
Harvey, at this late date.

1084
02:00:40,285 --> 02:00:42,325
Damn your heart!

1085
02:00:44,331 --> 02:00:47,000
Do you think that
I wanna go on punishing you?

1086
02:00:47,125 --> 02:00:51,668
We've grown old together, and in all that
time I've only asked one thing from you.

1087
02:00:51,797 --> 02:00:55,047
Cooperation. The only thing
I've ever gotten back was defiance!

1088
02:00:55,175 --> 02:00:59,303
Not once have you ever shown
a sign of rehabilitation!

1089
02:01:12,360 --> 02:01:14,981
- Rehabilitation.
- Yes. Rehabilitation.

1090
02:01:15,113 --> 02:01:17,983
I wonder if you know
what the word means.

1091
02:01:19,951 --> 02:01:21,351
Do you?

1092
02:01:21,911 --> 02:01:23,820
Now don't be insulting.

1093
02:01:28,459 --> 02:01:32,124
The unabridged <i>Webster's</i>
<i>International Dictionary</i>

1094
02:01:32,255 --> 02:01:35,209
says it comes from the Latin root <i>habilis.</i>

1095
02:01:35,341 --> 02:01:40,086
The definition is:
To invest again with dignity.

1096
02:01:40,721 --> 02:01:45,882
Do you consider that part of your job, to
give a man back the dignity he once had?

1097
02:01:47,186 --> 02:01:49,724
Your only interest is in how he behaves.

1098
02:01:49,856 --> 02:01:54,020
You told me that once a long time ago,
and I'll never forget it.

1099
02:01:54,153 --> 02:01:58,316
"You'll conform to our ideas
of how you should behave."

1100
02:01:58,449 --> 02:02:02,529
And you haven't retreated from
that stand one inch in 35 years.

1101
02:02:03,328 --> 02:02:06,911
You want your prisoners to dance
out the gates like puppets on a string,

1102
02:02:07,040 --> 02:02:10,540
with rubber-stamp values
impressed by you,

1103
02:02:10,669 --> 02:02:14,881
with your sense of conformity,
your sense of behaviour,

1104
02:02:15,007 --> 02:02:17,462
even your sense of morality.

1105
02:02:18,927 --> 02:02:21,632
That's why you're a failure, Harvey.

1106
02:02:21,764 --> 02:02:24,301
You and the whole science of penology.

1107
02:02:25,184 --> 02:02:28,932
Because you rob prisoners of
the most important thing in their lives -

1108
02:02:29,062 --> 02:02:31,102
their individuality.

1109
02:02:32,441 --> 02:02:37,567
On the outside they're lost, automatons,
just going through the motions of living.

1110
02:02:37,697 --> 02:02:42,026
But underneath there's a deep,
deep hatred for what you did to them.

1111
02:02:42,869 --> 02:02:46,452
First chance they get
to attack society, they do it.

1112
02:02:46,581 --> 02:02:50,080
The result? More than half
come back to prison.

1113
02:02:53,505 --> 02:02:55,746
Now it's all here in my book.

1114
02:02:55,882 --> 02:02:59,381
And I suggest you read it
and you read it thoroughly.

1115
02:03:03,681 --> 02:03:06,351
All right, you've spoken your piece.

1116
02:03:10,396 --> 02:03:13,481
I have no course left but to speak mine.

1117
02:03:20,115 --> 02:03:25,620
This San Francisco climate sure doesn't
help an old man's aches and pains.

1118
02:03:25,746 --> 02:03:27,786
Where does it hurt you, Harvey?

1119
02:03:29,333 --> 02:03:32,002
In my left shoulder and down my arm.

1120
02:03:33,796 --> 02:03:36,085
You should have a medical checkup.

1121
02:03:36,215 --> 02:03:37,215
Yeah.

1122
02:04:12,169 --> 02:04:13,169
594.

1123
02:04:17,299 --> 02:04:19,338
You got a visitor.

1124
02:05:12,230 --> 02:05:14,430
Hello, Bob.

1125
02:05:14,774 --> 02:05:17,016
Hello, Stell.

1126
02:05:17,151 --> 02:05:19,607
Well, here I am.

1127
02:05:21,072 --> 02:05:23,527
I know what you told Bull to tell me.

1128
02:05:24,575 --> 02:05:27,362
Then why did you come?

1129
02:05:27,495 --> 02:05:29,950
What else have I got to do?

1130
02:05:31,082 --> 02:05:32,282
Bob...

1131
02:05:32,959 --> 02:05:37,337
Bob, I could get on your visiting list.
I could get a job in Oakland maybe.

1132
02:05:37,464 --> 02:05:39,457
I could get a room at the waterfront,

1133
02:05:39,591 --> 02:05:43,007
and you could get some spyglasses
and see my room from your cell.

1134
02:05:43,137 --> 02:05:44,963
It's no use, Stell.

1135
02:05:45,097 --> 02:05:49,889
Please, Bob. There's still hope.
Bureau policy changes.

1136
02:05:50,018 --> 02:05:53,933
There's always the chance
the president will pardon you.

1137
02:05:55,190 --> 02:05:58,357
Why did you come
2,000 miles for nothin'?

1138
02:05:58,485 --> 02:06:00,941
Just to see me once a month?

1139
02:06:02,739 --> 02:06:05,824
I came because I'm your wife, that's why.

1140
02:06:08,370 --> 02:06:12,664
Bob, the only life I got is you.

1141
02:06:13,333 --> 02:06:16,999
Then you've got a damned
poor future, old girl.

1142
02:06:17,129 --> 02:06:19,917
I'm never gonna get outta here.

1143
02:06:20,049 --> 02:06:23,584
I could get a job in a factory.
I could write letters every day.

1144
02:06:23,720 --> 02:06:27,670
- It would be like old times.
- You'd wither away and die waiting.

1145
02:06:27,807 --> 02:06:30,892
- Forget it, Stell. It's the end of the line.
- Please, Bob.

1146
02:06:31,019 --> 02:06:34,719
Now, listen to me. Listen carefully.

1147
02:06:39,652 --> 02:06:42,108
You fought your heart out for me.

1148
02:06:47,535 --> 02:06:51,403
You fought your heart out for me,
but the sun's gone down.

1149
02:06:51,539 --> 02:06:54,493
And don't look for it to rise again.

1150
02:06:54,626 --> 02:06:57,295
I want you to pretend that I'm a dead man.

1151
02:06:59,297 --> 02:07:05,004
I want you to pretend...
that you're standin' on my grave.

1152
02:07:11,727 --> 02:07:14,847
Remember the story
I told you about Runty,

1153
02:07:14,980 --> 02:07:17,020
my sparrow, how I turned him loose?

1154
02:07:18,859 --> 02:07:21,896
Yes, but he came back.

1155
02:07:22,488 --> 02:07:24,943
Yes, he came back and he died.

1156
02:07:28,119 --> 02:07:31,618
Stell, you're not such an old girl.

1157
02:07:33,165 --> 02:07:36,451
You still got a dance or two left in ya.

1158
02:07:36,585 --> 02:07:39,041
Don't waste 'em waitin' for a lifer.

1159
02:07:45,469 --> 02:07:47,759
All right, Bob.

1160
02:07:47,889 --> 02:07:49,965
Whatever you say.

1161
02:07:52,144 --> 02:07:56,687
Now you... go on back
to Shelbyville, Indiana.

1162
02:07:58,525 --> 02:08:00,981
Open up a pet store.

1163
02:08:01,987 --> 02:08:03,564
All right, Bob.

1164
02:08:03,697 --> 02:08:06,152
Specialise in parakeets.

1165
02:08:06,283 --> 02:08:09,486
They're the coming thing, you know.

1166
02:08:09,619 --> 02:08:13,949
I could still sell Stroud's Specifics.

1167
02:08:15,250 --> 02:08:18,584
- There's still a market for 'em.
- And canaries.

1168
02:08:18,712 --> 02:08:22,626
- People always like canaries.
- That's the ticket.

1169
02:08:22,841 --> 02:08:27,384
And if a bird got sick,
I could look in your book.

1170
02:08:29,139 --> 02:08:30,515
Sure, Stell.

1171
02:08:35,730 --> 02:08:38,185
I can have a nice little business.

1172
02:08:41,611 --> 02:08:43,936
Stell, you'll be just fine.

1173
02:08:55,082 --> 02:08:57,538
I've got to go now.

1174
02:09:12,141 --> 02:09:14,182
Goodbye, Bob.

1175
02:09:46,802 --> 02:09:48,841
Goodbye, wife.

1176
02:09:59,107 --> 02:10:02,357
<i> A prison is</i>
<i>a vast boiler of despair,</i>

1177
02:10:02,485 --> 02:10:05,155
<i>stoked by hatred and anger.</i>

1178
02:10:05,280 --> 02:10:09,989
<i>Alcatraz has the reputation of being</i>
<i>the harshest of all American prisons.</i>

1179
02:10:10,118 --> 02:10:13,202
<i>This means endless hours of idleness,</i>

1180
02:10:13,329 --> 02:10:18,406
<i>with little useful work and</i>
<i>limited prospects for rehabilitation.</i>

1181
02:10:18,543 --> 02:10:23,501
<i>Eventually, the pressure of life</i>
<i>without hope becomes unendurable.</i>

1182
02:10:32,056 --> 02:10:36,006
<i>On a lovely spring day in May 1946,</i>

1183
02:10:36,144 --> 02:10:39,892
<i>two convicts named Logue and Burns</i>

1184
02:10:40,023 --> 02:10:44,318
<i>started one of the most terrifying</i>
<i>riots in prison history.</i>

1185
02:10:44,445 --> 02:10:48,229
<i>With a contrivance made</i>
<i>in the machine shop and smuggled out,</i>

1186
02:10:48,365 --> 02:10:51,070
<i>Burns spread the bars in the gun gallery,</i>

1187
02:10:51,202 --> 02:10:55,330
<i>secured arms and ammunition,</i>
<i>and crossed over to "D" block,</i>

1188
02:10:55,456 --> 02:10:58,326
<i>which contained Robert Stroud's cell.</i>

1189
02:11:09,261 --> 02:11:10,261
You.

1190
02:11:11,138 --> 02:11:12,738
Hapling.

1191
02:11:13,933 --> 02:11:14,964
Come here.

1192
02:11:20,064 --> 02:11:22,306
Come here, you fink.

1193
02:11:34,412 --> 02:11:36,012
Open it.

1194
02:12:19,667 --> 02:12:22,123
We're takin' over!

1195
02:13:23,315 --> 02:13:27,609
Call the coastguard and tell him to start
circling the island with patrol boats.

1196
02:13:27,736 --> 02:13:32,979
I wanna talk to the commanding officer
on Treasure Island, the chief of police,

1197
02:13:33,117 --> 02:13:35,156
and the FBI.

1198
02:13:54,389 --> 02:13:57,840
I'll have a statement
for the press by midnight.

1199
02:13:57,976 --> 02:13:58,976
Yes.

1200
02:14:07,277 --> 02:14:11,191
<i> The frenzied plan of escape</i>
<i>was hopeless from the beginning.</i>

1201
02:14:11,322 --> 02:14:14,442
<i>It was predicated on getting</i>
<i>the key to the exercise yard,</i>

1202
02:14:14,576 --> 02:14:18,027
<i>which would at least allow</i>
<i>the prisoners to get out in the open.</i>

1203
02:14:18,163 --> 02:14:21,413
<i>When this failed,</i>
<i>they knew they were doomed.</i>

1204
02:14:21,541 --> 02:14:23,784
<i>After a brief outburst of destruction,</i>

1205
02:14:23,919 --> 02:14:27,454
<i>the prisoners settled</i>
<i>into a mood of quiet despair.</i>

1206
02:14:27,590 --> 02:14:32,667
<i>Shoemaker had no way of knowing that</i>
<i>the weapons possessed by the mutineers</i>

1207
02:14:32,803 --> 02:14:38,557
<i>totalled one rifle and one revolver,</i>
<i>with 71 rounds of ammunition.</i>

1208
02:16:12,071 --> 02:16:14,111
He's hurt bad. He's hurt bad.

1209
02:16:16,701 --> 02:16:18,740
Go back! Go back!

1210
02:16:31,924 --> 02:16:36,005
The kid needs help.
You know somethin' about medicine.

1211
02:16:36,138 --> 02:16:37,138
Help?

1212
02:16:42,853 --> 02:16:45,225
Try and snap out of it.

1213
02:16:45,355 --> 02:16:47,811
Snap out of it, you punchy old bum!

1214
02:16:49,610 --> 02:16:51,649
Now hold on.

1215
02:16:53,947 --> 02:16:56,403
- Where's he hit?
- In the gut.

1216
02:17:02,080 --> 02:17:03,880
Let's go.

1217
02:17:26,564 --> 02:17:27,845
Turn on the PA system.

1218
02:17:32,070 --> 02:17:34,109
All for nothin'.

1219
02:17:34,739 --> 02:17:38,653
- How do you feel, kid?
- How do you think I feel? I'm dyin'.

1220
02:17:45,208 --> 02:17:47,247
Good femoral pulse.

1221
02:17:57,929 --> 02:18:00,135
There's not much bleeding.

1222
02:18:00,265 --> 02:18:05,260
I don't believe it hit a big artery.
It may have pierced the gut.

1223
02:18:08,107 --> 02:18:09,518
Colour's not bad.

1224

<i>Now listen to this. Men in "D" block,</i>
<i>this is Warden Shoemaker.</i>

02:18:16,240 --> 02:18:18,731
<i>You haven't got a chance, you hear me?</i>

1226
02:18:18,868 --> 02:18:21,537
<i>You had better surrender your arms.</i>

1227
02:18:27,501 --> 02:18:29,541
This'll all be over soon.

1228
02:18:29,670 --> 02:18:33,169
They'll get you to a hospital.
You got a good chance.

1229
02:18:34,008 --> 02:18:36,463
I'm doin' 25. I'll get grey-headed.

1230
02:18:37,928 --> 02:18:41,013
- What do I have to live for?
- You just lie quiet.

1231
02:18:42,016 --> 02:18:44,341
I'm fed up with this life.

1232
02:18:44,477 --> 02:18:48,606
You don't know what I'm goin' through,
old man. I'm sick of it.

1233
02:18:51,610 --> 02:18:53,768
I hope to God I do die.

1234
02:18:56,740 --> 02:18:59,409
Never had a real good day all my life.

1235
02:19:01,495 --> 02:19:02,495
Life.

1236
02:19:05,415 --> 02:19:07,657
Who needs it?

1237
02:19:07,793 --> 02:19:11,790
You're just a kid.
You got your whole future ahead of you.

1238
02:19:13,173 --> 02:19:15,628
Knock it off, will ya?

1239
02:19:16,968 --> 02:19:21,547
How dare you lie there
and talk about dyin' at your age.

1240
02:19:27,145 --> 02:19:28,145
Bull.

1241
02:19:49,210 --> 02:19:51,249
The kid wasn't hurt that bad.

1242
02:19:54,382 --> 02:19:56,421
How the hell do you know?

1243
02:19:57,385 --> 02:20:01,085
I tell you, he might have lived
if he'd put up a fight.

1244
02:20:01,222 --> 02:20:06,561
What's wrong with knocking yourself off
in a maggot pile like this?

1245
02:20:06,686 --> 02:20:09,355
- What?
- I said what's wrong with dyin'?

1246
02:20:18,866 --> 02:20:20,905
What's wrong with dying?

1247
02:20:23,829 --> 02:20:28,372
Cos life's too precious a gift, that's why.

1248
02:20:29,543 --> 02:20:32,164
Because the first duty of life is to live.

1249

Warden Shoemaker.

1253

Are you there?

1254
02:22:26,495 --> 02:22:27,777
Give me the bullhorn.

1255
02:22:30,125 --> 02:22:32,164
Can you hear me, Warden?

1256
02:22:36,131 --> 02:22:38,207
Harvey, this is Bob Stroud.

1257
02:22:40,177 --> 02:22:41,552
I can hear you, Stroud.

1258
02:22:44,055 --> 02:22:46,095
Then watch this.

1259
02:23:02,908 --> 02:23:09,076
There are now no more guns in "D" block.
You can call off your marines, Harvey.

1260
02:23:09,206 --> 02:23:11,245
This is isn't Iwo Jima.

1261
02:23:13,711 --> 02:23:16,167
What about Logue and Burns?

1262
02:23:17,048 --> 02:23:19,087
They're dead.

1263
02:23:20,510 --> 02:23:25,218
Of course, if you wanna kill us all,
you can drop a small atom bomb.

1264
02:23:27,934 --> 02:23:31,433
How do I know there are
no more guns up there?

1265
02:23:37,318 --> 02:23:39,774
Because I give you my word.

1266
02:23:44,826 --> 02:23:49,571
I think it'll be safe to enter "D" block now.
There'll be no more firing.

1267
02:23:50,248 --> 02:23:53,118
Sir, you gonna take
the word of one convict?

1268
02:23:54,377 --> 02:23:57,877
That one convict's been
a thorn in my side for 35 years.

1269
02:23:59,800 --> 02:24:04,343
But I'll give him one thing.
He's never lied to me.

1270

<i> Warden Shoemaker died in 1953.</i>

1271

<i>My book was published two years later.</i>

1272

<i>It is not known if its publication</i>

1275
02:24:29,496 --> 02:24:33,624
<i>It was not a release, however,</i>
<i>but a transfer to another prison.</i>

1276
02:24:37,004 --> 02:24:40,374
Mr Stroud, how does it feel
to get off the Rock?

1277
02:24:40,508 --> 02:24:43,794
Well, If you San Franciscans
had any true civic pride,

1278
02:24:43,928 --> 02:24:48,804
you'd blow that place outta the water
instead of advertising it. What an eyesore.

1279
02:24:48,933 --> 02:24:51,222
Is it true you've never seen
a television set?

1280
02:24:51,352 --> 02:24:54,852
Yes, but from what I hear,
I haven't missed very much.

1281
02:24:54,981 --> 02:24:59,892
If you're paroled, do you think
you can adjust to the modern world?

1282
02:25:00,028 --> 02:25:03,361
Why? What's so special
about your modern world, son?

1283
02:25:06,242 --> 02:25:10,536
Boeing 707. Weighs 247,000lb.

1284
02:25:10,663 --> 02:25:12,822
Carries a payload of 22,000.

1285
02:25:12,957 --> 02:25:15,958
Each engine has a thrust of 13,000lb.

1286
02:25:16,085 --> 02:25:18,956
Cruises at 595 miles an hour.

1287
02:25:19,088 --> 02:25:22,173
Just because a man's in prison
doesn't mean he's a boob.

1288
02:25:22,300 --> 02:25:24,922
Will you work with birds
where you're going?

1289
02:25:25,054 --> 02:25:28,802
I'm afraid not.
In the eyes of the prison bureau,

1290
02:25:28,933 --> 02:25:33,180
avian research is, as you boys
might put it, for the birds.

1291
02:25:33,312 --> 02:25:34,806
All right.

1292
02:25:34,939 --> 02:25:40,229
Just one more question. Do you have
any particular project in mind?

1293
02:25:40,361 --> 02:25:43,527
Nothing specific.
I pass the time profitably.

1294
02:25:43,656 --> 02:25:46,573
I read a great deal, reflect.

1295
02:25:46,700 --> 02:25:50,319
I might even spend a pleasant hour
measuring the size of a cloud.

1296
02:25:50,454 --> 02:25:53,124
- Thanks, Mr Stroud.
- Good luck to you.

1297
02:26:03,592 --> 02:26:05,632
Can I have a minute, Mike?

1298
02:26:19,192 --> 02:26:21,944
You must be Tom Gaddis.

1299
02:26:22,070 --> 02:26:24,526
That's right, Mr Stroud.

1300
02:26:24,656 --> 02:26:28,654
I heard you were getting a transfer.
I thought I might get a chance to see you.

1301
02:26:28,785 --> 02:26:31,822
You know me well enough to call me Bob.

1302
02:26:31,955 --> 02:26:35,869
- How did you know it was me?
- An old con's instinct.

1303
02:26:37,335 --> 02:26:41,713
Bob, I was hoping when we met
it might be under different circumstances.

1304
02:26:41,840 --> 02:26:43,833
What circumstances?

1305
02:26:43,967 --> 02:26:46,458
A release, not a transfer. I'm sorry.

1306
02:26:46,595 --> 02:26:50,924
Don't be a square, Tom. I'm going
to Springfield, and do you know what?

1307
02:26:51,057 --> 02:26:54,344
I'm going to sleep in a room
without a lock on the door. Think of it.

1308
02:26:54,479 --> 02:26:57,894
To be able to walk in and out
of a room any time you want.

1309
02:26:58,024 --> 02:27:00,182
They got 400 acres up there.

1310
02:27:00,318 --> 02:27:05,110
I can walk a half a mile, maybe,
without once turning a corner. Imagine.

1311
02:27:05,490 --> 02:27:10,282
Don't be sorry, Tom. It's gonna be
a swell place to live till I get my release.

1312
02:27:10,703 --> 02:27:13,574
I know. Live it one day at a time.

1313
02:27:13,706 --> 02:27:17,075
You said it, kid. Soar like a bird.

1314
02:27:17,210 --> 02:27:19,286
We gotta catch a train, Bob.

1315
02:27:19,420 --> 02:27:21,579
All right, Mike.

1316
02:27:21,714 --> 02:27:23,754
Goodbye, Tom.

1317
02:27:24,550 --> 02:27:26,590
Thanks for helping me.

1318
02:27:46,490 --> 02:27:50,155
Tom, you know what they used to call
Alcatraz in the old days?

1319
02:27:50,285 --> 02:27:52,741
- What?
- Bird Island.

1320
