You find this amusing. I don't!

- You must listen.

Never bother with him, Cissy.
He's a bully.

Now, Lottie, in bars 17, 18 and 19,
you were deeply flat.

No, I don't think I was.
I think the piano needs tuning.

Anne, darling,
would you mind singing it for us?

36

I don't do chorus, Cedric. I never have.

37
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:33,740
I achieved immediate
international success at the Royal Opera

Reggie, it's empty.
You can't save seats, Reg.

He's not coming.

00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,341
- Wilf, he's not coming.
- Why now?

55
00:06:33,341 --> 00:06:35,300
You seem to think
that you own the thing.

56
00:06:35,301 --> 00:06:37,969
We've been sitting at this table
since I first came here.

57
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:40,394
- That's precisely the point.
- It's not fair, Reggie.

58
00:06:40,557 --> 00:06:42,558
We want the window
sometimes, don't we?

59
00:06:42,559 --> 00:06:46,311
Yes. If this place has to shut down
in six months, which it very well might,

60
00:06:46,313 --> 00:06:49,274
then I want to try and remember
I once had a fucking window seat.

61
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:50,818
Excuse me, please.

62
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:54,243
You can't deny it, Wilf,
you soloists would be lost without us.

63
00:06:54,406 --> 00:06:58,242
Say that once more, and I swear
I'll ram a fork up yourjacksy, Harry.

64
00:06:58,243 --> 00:07:00,161
- He's right, Wilf.
- Anybody got a fork?

65
00:07:00,161 --> 00:07:02,911
- And you know he is.
- Make that two forks.

66
00:07:02,912 --> 00:07:07,250
Ah, merci, Angelique. Have you
done something new to your hair?

67
00:07:07,251 --> 00:07:10,919
- No, I just put my fringe in front.
- Oh, I love your fringe in front.

68
00:07:10,921 --> 00:07:14,590
I give you extra slice
of fried bread this morning.

69
00:07:14,591 --> 00:07:16,970
- I noticed.
- And your favourite - apricot jam.

70
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:19,389
Oh. Magnifique, Angelique.

71
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:21,682
Fancy vous a little rumpy-pumpy
ce soir?

72
00:07:21,683 --> 00:07:24,100
Qu'est-ce que c'est,
'rumpy-pumpy'?

73
00:07:24,102 --> 00:07:25,686
Oh, secrets of the marriage bed,

74
00:07:25,686 --> 00:07:27,730
you'll have to answer my proposal
at once.

75
00:07:27,731 --> 00:07:29,272
Bon appétit.

76
00:07:29,273 --> 00:07:30,991
- Cissy, Cissy!
- Ready.

77
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:34,319
- Remember the emergency meeting, 12:15.
- Cedric. Cedric.

78
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,904
- Breakfast time.
- This is critical.

79
00:07:36,906 --> 00:07:39,742
All members of the gala committee,
please note,

80
00:07:39,743 --> 00:07:42,744
we have a serious problem
with our star tenor, Frank White.

81
00:07:42,745 --> 00:07:46,916
As such, there's an emergency meeting
at 12 noon - precisely.

82
00:07:46,918 --> 00:07:49,377
Reggie, don't forget to remind me.

83
00:07:49,378 --> 00:07:50,924
I'll set my watch.

84
00:07:52,756 --> 00:07:54,555
Hey, what's this? Look.

85
00:07:54,716 --> 00:07:57,635
- Didn't you say today was the day, Reg?
- What's today?

86
00:07:57,636 --> 00:07:59,720
Tadek setting off
to fetch the new arrival.

87
00:07:59,721 --> 00:08:02,972
- There's to be a new arrival?
- Cissy, we've talked about it for days.

88
00:08:02,973 --> 00:08:04,517
- You too.
- Really?

89
00:08:04,518 --> 00:08:06,060
- Yeah.
- Who is it?

90
00:08:06,062 --> 00:08:08,235
- They'd only send the van for a star.
- Mm-hm.

91
00:08:08,396 --> 00:08:10,940
When I came,
I had to pay for me own taxi.

92
00:08:10,941 --> 00:08:13,359
They sent a private car
with a chauffeur for me.

93
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,486
This is a replacement
for Leonard Timms.

94
00:08:15,488 --> 00:08:18,949
He was a real dear friend of mine.
I'm really gonna miss him terribly.

95
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:21,243
He was a genius, you know.
He could fart at will.

96
00:08:21,244 --> 00:08:23,035
Yeah, Wilf, we're having breakfast.

97
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:25,454
- I'm not kidding.
- But don't let that stop you.

98
00:08:25,455 --> 00:08:27,456
I swear it's true.
I saw it with my own eyes.

99
00:08:27,457 --> 00:08:31,053
He got down on all fours
and went into a meditative state.

100
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:35,762
And when he was ready, he could exhale
and inhale through his anal canal.

101
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:39,970
- I suppose that's the stroke talking.
- I suppose it must be.

102
00:08:39,971 --> 00:08:45,023
Hey, Cissy, do you think I could replace
Nobby for a quick one in the long grass?

103
00:08:46,144 --> 00:08:48,478
You have the nicest tits
I've ever seen in my life.

104
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,948
Thank you.

105
00:08:50,982 --> 00:08:55,533
Reg, you've got to try this jam.
It is unbelievable.

106
00:08:55,695 --> 00:08:57,868
It's like eating Christmas.

107
00:09:34,234 --> 00:09:37,738
Be careful with that one.

108
00:09:37,738 --> 00:09:39,284
It's fragile.

109
00:09:40,823 --> 00:09:44,168
I come back for the trunk. And for you.

110
00:09:54,213 --> 00:09:57,130
I... I... I apologise.

111
00:09:57,131 --> 00:09:59,467
Please be kind.

112
00:09:59,469 --> 00:10:01,135
We were different people then.

113
00:10:01,136 --> 00:10:03,059
Be kind. Be kind.

114
00:10:05,516 --> 00:10:07,813
I can't do this. I can't. Stop. Stop.

115
00:10:07,976 --> 00:10:09,899
- You say to me something?
- What did you say?

116
00:10:10,896 --> 00:10:13,564
- Why are we stopping?
- We are not.

117
00:10:13,567 --> 00:10:15,409
- We're on the way.
- Right.

118
00:10:16,444 --> 00:10:19,994
- Should I call Dr Cogan?
- No. No, thank you.

119
00:10:26,203 --> 00:10:29,289
These hydrangeas are beautiful.
Do you like them, Marta?

120
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:31,464
Yes, I do, but I would never
put on my table.

121
00:10:31,626 --> 00:10:33,710
Well, well, well, this is new.

122
00:10:33,711 --> 00:10:36,505
I've never seen you
arranging flowers before, Dr Cogan.

123
00:10:36,506 --> 00:10:40,466
Really, Wilf? Haven't you noticed we've
cut down on staff in the past months?

124
00:10:40,467 --> 00:10:44,428
And is this for the new arrival? Is it?
Or is that a secret?

125
00:10:44,431 --> 00:10:46,349
Is it, Marta?

126
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:49,142
Is that a new skirt you're wearing,
Dr Cogan?

127
00:10:49,143 --> 00:10:51,271
It clings beautifully to you.

128
00:10:51,437 --> 00:10:54,564
And how it accentuates
your already beautiful legs.

129
00:10:54,564 --> 00:10:57,608
My goodness.
What do you think of that, Marta?

130
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:59,320
I don't talk such things.

131
00:10:59,321 --> 00:11:02,573
You're overstepping the line, Wilf.
Go for your walk.

132
00:11:02,574 --> 00:11:05,200
I would love to,
if only you would come with me.

133
00:11:05,201 --> 00:11:06,785
Go for your walk.

134
00:11:06,786 --> 00:11:08,328
May I?

135
00:11:08,329 --> 00:11:11,498
I wonder if you could help me. I can
never do this without my glasses.

136
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,046
I can't see a thing.

137
00:11:15,337 --> 00:11:16,964
You don't have a buttonhole, Wilf.

138
00:11:17,132 --> 00:11:19,424
Well, there you go.

139
00:11:19,425 --> 00:11:22,843
You know, I could propose to you, but
this is as close to kneeling as I get.

140
00:11:22,843 --> 00:11:24,719
Go for your walk.

141
00:11:24,721 --> 00:11:27,265
Sure. Would you like to join me, Marta?

142
00:11:27,266 --> 00:11:29,142
I don't do such things.

143
00:11:29,143 --> 00:11:31,226
He's a very naughty boy, Marta.

144
00:11:31,227 --> 00:11:33,645
He could be your father
or your grandfather.

145
00:11:33,646 --> 00:11:37,442
Like that. OK?
Swing it close to the ground.

146
00:11:37,443 --> 00:11:40,070
That's it. That's it. Like a pendulum.
Just like this.

147
00:11:40,237 --> 00:11:42,739
When you're finished
being a croquet expert, Nigel,

148
00:11:42,741 --> 00:11:44,533
I have a pound says
I'll kick your arse.

149
00:11:44,534 --> 00:11:46,784
Ah, the way you play,
you probably will.

150
00:11:46,784 --> 00:11:49,579
You forget.
I saw your Barber Of Seville,

151
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,582
and your singing
brought tears to my ears.

152
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:55,720
Saw you in Carmen,
I'll never forget it, but I'll try.

153
00:12:32,123 --> 00:12:34,467
- Morning, Nobby.
- Ah, morning, Mr Bond.

154
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:36,835
- Simon, what's up?
- All good, mate.

155
00:12:36,837 --> 00:12:38,421
Oh, by the way, Nobby,

156
00:12:38,422 --> 00:12:41,048
if you get a chance,
I could use another one of the usual.

157
00:12:41,049 --> 00:12:43,050
- Do you need any money?
- No, it's alright.

158
00:12:43,051 --> 00:12:46,594
Look, I've got some change from last
time. I'll stick it in the usual place.

159
00:12:46,595 --> 00:12:49,933
Oh, and watch it, Cissy Robson's
been looking for you all morning.

160
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:53,234
Can't think why. I'm the
most attractive man in the place.

161
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,575
♪ VERDI: La donna è mobile

162
00:12:59,943 --> 00:13:03,743
I read somewhere that the average man
thinks of sex every seven seconds.

163
00:13:03,907 --> 00:13:05,448
Do you?

164
00:13:05,448 --> 00:13:07,576
I wish it was only every
seven seconds.

165
00:13:08,952 --> 00:13:12,579
Do you know,
the first time I set eyes on her,

166
00:13:12,581 --> 00:13:15,249
I thought she was
the most beautiful, sexiest creature

167
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,960
I'd ever clapped my eyes on.

168
00:13:16,961 --> 00:13:18,628
Oh.

169
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:21,090
Oh, Cissy, Cissy, my love,

170
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:23,968
can you imagine the passionate love
we might have made?

171
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,470
But it's not too late.

172
00:13:25,636 --> 00:13:29,264
We can still dive beneath the blankets
and cuddle till the end of time.

173
00:13:29,265 --> 00:13:32,434
- What do you say to that, sweetie?
- Ready.

174
00:13:32,435 --> 00:13:34,810
Why are you laughing?

175
00:13:34,811 --> 00:13:37,813
You'll never guess what I've been
listening to. Our Rigoletto.

176
00:13:37,814 --> 00:13:39,690
We are so lovely...

177
00:13:39,691 --> 00:13:42,651
- Uh, Cissy, the gala committee.
- Oh...

178
00:13:42,653 --> 00:13:45,114
This was the last time we sang it.
Remember, Reggie?

179
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:47,408
- Why have they reissued it?
- I don't know.

180
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,828
I remember the recording session,
the production, everything,

181
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:52,371
like it was yesterday,

182
00:13:52,372 --> 00:13:55,332
and yet I can't remember
what I had for breakfast this morning.

183
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,460
- Apricot jam.
- 'Rigoletto - Horton and Paget'.

184
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,252
My name isn't there, of course.

185

I should've been top of the bill,
I had the name part.

186
00:14:01,881 --> 00:14:04,716
Still, I made a living from it,
which was all I really wanted.

187
00:14:04,717 --> 00:14:08,010
I'm not like you, you see, Reggie,
you're an artist, I'm an artisan.

188
00:14:08,011 --> 00:14:11,263
Where's my bag?
I can't find my bag. Where is it?

189
00:14:11,265 --> 00:14:13,184
Oh. Thank you, Reggie.

190
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,563
And you're safe back from Karachi,
and I'm so glad.

191
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,277
Oh...

192
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,609
Why Karachi?

193
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,276
Well, her father was Indian army.

Frank White has just pulled out.
He doesn't feel up to the gala.

217
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,042
It's even in the local paper.

Oh, he's such a lovely man.

220

This is a disaster.

221
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:30,479
Because he's pulled out, ticket sales
have already fallen by 60%.

The givers aren't giving.

223

If we can't make the gala
into the hottest ticket in town,

224
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:37,060
this house could collapse
about our ears.

225
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,728
Oh! We could lose it!

226
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:41,607
We have to find a replacement
for Frank immediately.

227
00:15:41,609 --> 00:15:44,444
Who was it who said,

00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:47,904

please raise your hand.

- She's raising her hand.
- What?

234
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:05,975
Bette Davis. Bette Davis. She said,
she said, 'Old age is not for sissies'.

238
00:16:16,268 --> 00:16:19,612
I'll have no 'tra-la-la' at my gala!
None of it!

239
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,356
What about Reggie? La Donna e Mobile.

240
00:16:23,358 --> 00:16:25,276
I just had a brilliant idea,

241
00:16:25,277 --> 00:16:28,738
to ask Reggie if he'll sing
La Donna e Mobile.

242
00:16:28,739 --> 00:16:30,615
Oh, yeah, what?

243
00:16:30,616 --> 00:16:33,410
Reggie's a bit funny about
La Donna e Mobile.

244
00:16:33,411 --> 00:16:35,036
Your job is to ask him.

245
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:37,459
Please put your hand/arm down.

246
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,960
- He won't do it.
- That was my idea.

247
00:16:41,961 --> 00:16:43,838
Yes, it was.

248
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:08,029
Look.

249
00:17:12,034 --> 00:17:14,456
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my.

250
00:17:19,207 --> 00:17:21,505
- Excuse me, love.
- Oh.

251
00:17:25,923 --> 00:17:27,299
Here.

252
00:17:38,227 --> 00:17:42,026
Most of our residents
are on the floor upstairs.

253
00:17:43,856 --> 00:17:46,441
This is Sir Thomas Beecham.

254
00:17:46,442 --> 00:17:48,610
He was one of Britain's
greatest conductors.

255
00:17:48,612 --> 00:17:50,571
Yes. I know who he was.

256
00:17:50,572 --> 00:17:54,159
He inherited a fortune.
His grandfather made laxatives.

257
00:17:54,159 --> 00:17:57,583
Naming a nursing home
after him is frighteningly apt.

258
00:17:57,745 --> 00:18:00,414
Um... these flowers are here
to welcome you.

259
00:18:00,415 --> 00:18:02,082
I'll have them sent up to your room.

260
00:18:02,084 --> 00:18:04,085
We're very lucky to
have you here.

261
00:18:04,086 --> 00:18:05,962
Your room is as large
as Anne Langley's.

262
00:18:05,963 --> 00:18:07,547
Oh, God, is she here?

263
00:18:07,549 --> 00:18:10,222
It's a beautiful suite
in what we call the B Wing.

264
00:18:10,384 --> 00:18:12,176
Well, it sounds like a prison.

265
00:18:12,177 --> 00:18:14,429
The service lift
is currently being repaired,

266
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,972
but we have the chairlift,
which will be much easier.

267
00:18:16,974 --> 00:18:21,402
Chairlift? What do I do
when I get to the top, ski down?

268
00:18:23,063 --> 00:18:25,064
Brava!

269
00:18:25,065 --> 00:18:29,285
Brava! Brava!

270
00:18:31,405 --> 00:18:33,741
Brava! Brava!

271
00:18:33,742 --> 00:18:35,243
Oh.

272
00:18:38,788 --> 00:18:42,087
- Brava!
- Oh, how very kind.

273
00:18:43,751 --> 00:18:44,959
Oh...

274
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,758
Brava!

275
00:18:57,973 --> 00:19:00,943
Yeah, we could always do the Barber,
you, Cissy and me.

276
00:19:01,101 --> 00:19:03,437
For the gala.

277
00:19:03,438 --> 00:19:07,231
- Oh. You moved your ball.
- That's unthinkable! How dare you!

278
00:19:07,233 --> 00:19:09,401
I just saw you move it.
With your foot.

279
00:19:09,402 --> 00:19:12,070
Uh, Wilf, uh, she's married.

280
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:13,993
She gave me a look.

281
00:19:16,785 --> 00:19:18,327
- Your shot.
- Thank you, Wilf.

282
00:19:18,328 --> 00:19:20,330
You're never gonna get it from there,
anyway.

283
00:19:20,497 --> 00:19:22,039
Oh, you watch me.

284
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,581
Told you.

285
00:19:23,582 --> 00:19:26,751
I always wanted to sing Wagner - Tristan.
Never came my way.

286
00:19:26,752 --> 00:19:28,628
Wilf, what are you doing?

287
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:30,799
What does it look like I'm doing?

288
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,008
- Wagner!
- There are people watching.

289
00:19:33,009 --> 00:19:35,469
The British should stick
to British composers

290
00:19:35,471 --> 00:19:37,348
like Rossini, Donizetti, Verdi.

291
00:19:37,514 --> 00:19:39,473
Boys! Boys! Boys!

292
00:19:39,474 --> 00:19:41,808
I know who it is.

293
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:43,859
I saw her. I saw her!

294
00:19:44,897 --> 00:19:48,191
George was right, it is a star.
But you'll never, never guess who it is.

295
00:19:48,192 --> 00:19:49,942
- Never.
- Well, tell us.

296
00:19:49,943 --> 00:19:51,777
Don't keep us in suspense
for eternity.

297
00:19:51,778 --> 00:19:53,362
No, you won't believe it.

298
00:19:53,363 --> 00:19:55,991
As large as life
and twice as terrifying...

299
00:19:56,159 --> 00:19:58,284
Um... Oh, it's gone. Um... uh...

300
00:19:58,285 --> 00:19:59,828
Think, Cissy. Think.

301
00:19:59,829 --> 00:20:01,996
- Soprano, beginning with G.
- Mary Garden.

302
00:20:01,997 --> 00:20:03,622
- No, no, no, no.
- Rita Gorr?

303
00:20:03,622 --> 00:20:06,332
- Galli-Curci.

- Gilda?
- Our Gilda.

- Rigoletto?
- Yes.

307
00:20:14,928 --> 00:20:17,262
- Jean Horton?
- Yes.

308
00:20:17,263 --> 00:20:19,265
Jean Horton. Yes.

309
00:20:24,479 --> 00:20:26,072
Oh, my darling.

310
00:20:28,983 --> 00:20:31,031
Steady, Reg.

311
00:20:33,111 --> 00:20:34,653
Excuse me, Dr Cogan.

312
00:20:34,655 --> 00:20:37,875
That's why you've kept it such a secret.
You didn't want me to know.

313
00:20:39,744 --> 00:20:42,339
- You mean Jean Horton?
- I should have been consulted.

314
00:20:43,373 --> 00:20:45,091
She was such a huge star...

315
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,001
I should have been consulted.

316
00:20:47,002 --> 00:20:49,044
Well, she didn't want
media attention...

317
00:20:49,045 --> 00:20:52,514
She didn't want? Nothing changes!
What about what I didn't want?!

318
00:20:53,801 --> 00:20:56,468
- It had nothing to do with you, Reggie.
- Obviously not!

319
00:20:56,468 --> 00:20:59,642
- I mean, it was simply at her request.
- She did know that I live here?

320
00:21:01,097 --> 00:21:03,441
She did know that I live here?

321
00:21:05,061 --> 00:21:07,313
Reggie, I'm sure
she's gonna be amicable...

322
00:21:07,315 --> 00:21:11,695
With great respect, Dr Cogan,
you don't know her.

323
00:21:12,862 --> 00:21:14,488
You don't know her.

324
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:23,543
I wanted a dignified senility.

325
00:21:25,123 --> 00:21:27,216
Fat chance now she's here.

326

somewhere else to live.

Don't you have one of your
talks tomorrow, Reggie?

329
00:21:36,803 --> 00:21:39,679
- What? - Your talk,
with the children tomorrow.

330
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,227

Poor thing.
She's having such a hard time.

Who is that smoking?

343
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,174
- George and Harry.
- Nobody, nothing.

344
00:22:17,175 --> 00:22:20,594
I don't know how many times I have
told you, smoking kills. Put those out.

- What?
- Drop them on the floor, please.

346
00:22:22,515 --> 00:22:24,766
- Thank you.
- Oh, for goodness sake.

347
00:22:24,767 --> 00:22:27,646
Give them a break.
George is 78, Harry's 82.

348
00:22:27,811 --> 00:22:29,480
Suppose they were
to stop smoking,

349
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:31,856
how much longer are they
going to live, a week?

350
00:22:31,858 --> 00:22:33,952
It would probably rain
that week, anyway.

351

- I think so.

352
00:22:36,572 --> 00:22:38,823
- Have you seen Reginald?
- He went to bed early.

353
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:42,160
Don't worry about him. He's as tough
as a monkey's tit, our Reggie.

No, it's different, slightly.

- Would you mind telling me what rap is?
- Tell me what opera is.

No, yes, uh, well, yes,
I will... I will eventually.

437
00:29:51,638 --> 00:29:55,016
No, you tell me what rap is
and then I'll tell you what opera is.

438
00:29:55,184 --> 00:29:56,768
How about you tell me
what opera is

439
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:58,938
and then later on I'll
tell you what rap is?

There you go.
What can I do?

441
00:30:01,232 --> 00:30:03,442
Uh, well, you know, originally,

442
00:30:03,443 --> 00:30:06,862
it was people just like you
went to the opera.

443
00:30:06,863 --> 00:30:11,117
Casual clothes, they took food,
they took alcohol, they threw things.

444
00:30:11,283 --> 00:30:14,201
Anyway, that was
a long time ago

445
00:30:14,202 --> 00:30:16,579
that rich people
took over the world of opera

446
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,330
with their fancy dress,

447
00:30:18,331 --> 00:30:24,044
and they took the soul out of it,
they made it something that it's not.

448
00:30:24,046 --> 00:30:27,507
What is it?
Uh, what is it?

449
00:30:27,509 --> 00:30:29,301
Would you wait for me, Cissy, dear?

450
00:30:29,302 --> 00:30:31,136
What? Oh, sorry, sorry.
I'm so excited.

451
00:30:31,137 --> 00:30:34,598

452
00:30:34,598 --> 00:30:37,515

and it doesn't last for long.

453
00:30:37,517 --> 00:30:41,818
You see, how could it? Because everyone
here looks after each other and...

454
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:44,900
Make up your mind, dear, please.

455
00:30:44,901 --> 00:30:47,736
And there's so much to enjoy here,
people coming and going,

456
00:30:47,737 --> 00:30:50,613
new faces, old friends,
new hobbies.

I'm meant to be in there.

459
00:30:57,622 --> 00:31:01,922
Side to side, basic.
Cissy, you're missing my class.

460
00:31:02,084 --> 00:31:03,677
Come in, darling.

461
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:09,888
Forward and back.

462
00:31:11,552 --> 00:31:14,227
Nice, hips, move those hips.

463
00:31:21,897 --> 00:31:24,440
Side to side now. Shake it, ladies.
Shake it.

464
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:27,283
This is not a retirement home,
this is a madhouse.

465
00:31:28,361 --> 00:31:29,408
God.

466
00:31:31,197 --> 00:31:32,744
Hello.

467
00:31:38,539 --> 00:31:41,464
Jean? Jean?

468
00:31:43,377 --> 00:31:46,347
Birthday benefit gala,
emergency, top secret.

469
00:31:47,882 --> 00:31:50,968
- Jean. - Didn't that used
to be Bobby Swanson?

470
00:31:50,968 --> 00:31:53,094
- Yes. - Well, he didn't
seem to recognise me.

471
00:31:53,095 --> 00:31:54,637
Isn't that odd?

472
00:31:54,638 --> 00:31:57,265
'Birthday benefit gala,
emergency, top secret'.

473
00:31:57,432 --> 00:31:59,850
Oh, whose birthday?
Mine isn't till January 6.

474
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:02,895
No, no, no. Not yours, darling, no.
No, Verdi's birthday.

475
00:32:02,897 --> 00:32:05,690
There's a benefit gala
and we're all expected to perform.

476
00:32:05,691 --> 00:32:09,111
- Wha...? Perform?
- Yes, we all do... what we do.

477
00:32:09,112 --> 00:32:10,737
At our age? That's ridiculous.

478
00:32:10,738 --> 00:32:13,448
No, it isn't.
Everybody can do something.

479
00:32:13,449 --> 00:32:16,784
Well, I'm not singing at Verdi's gala
or anybody else's.

480
00:32:16,785 --> 00:32:19,203
I don't sing anymore,
and that is final.

481
00:32:19,204 --> 00:32:21,752
Jean, I was listening
to our Rigoletto this morning,

482
00:32:21,915 --> 00:32:23,457
and we were all so good,

483
00:32:23,458 --> 00:32:27,837
but... Jean, your Gilda,
it was magnificent.

484
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:29,463
Yes, I know.

485
00:32:29,465 --> 00:32:33,312
I know. I never took less than
twelve curtain calls. Never.

486
00:32:35,138 --> 00:32:36,972
Where is Reggie?

487
00:32:36,973 --> 00:32:39,558
Um... I think he's round here.

488
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:44,063
Opera is, when a guy
is stabbed in the back,

489
00:32:44,064 --> 00:32:47,658
instead of bleeding, he sings.

490
00:32:47,817 --> 00:32:50,943
But it seems to me,
after much research,

491
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:55,239
that rap is,
when a guy is stabbed in the back,

492
00:32:55,241 --> 00:32:59,411
instead of bleeding, he talks - albeit
rhythmically, even with feeling.

493
00:32:59,413 --> 00:33:05,877
But because rap's spoken, the feeling is
sort of held in check, all on one note.

494
00:33:05,878 --> 00:33:08,379
I think he's in here. This is the...

495
00:33:08,379 --> 00:33:10,589
No, no, no, no.
This is the little music room.

496
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:13,299
This is the little m...
He'll be in the big music room

497
00:33:13,301 --> 00:33:16,055
because that's where they
do all the big lectures, in here.

498
00:33:16,221 --> 00:33:17,930
- Yes.
- No, Cissy, don't.

499
00:33:17,931 --> 00:33:20,599
- He'll be thrilled to see you.
- Don't.

500
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,310
In opera, we sing what we're feeling,

501
00:33:23,311 --> 00:33:27,563
and the song,
the rise and fall of the music,

502
00:33:27,566 --> 00:33:31,153
sets our emotions free.

503
00:33:31,154 --> 00:33:34,823
If you ask me,
I'd say to you that opera

504
00:33:34,823 --> 00:33:40,369
is simply the outpouring
of all the emotions

505
00:33:40,371 --> 00:33:43,215
that all of us carry inside us.

506
00:33:43,374 --> 00:33:47,167
Now, Joey, I think it's your turn.

507
00:33:47,168 --> 00:33:48,710
Show him what you can do.

508
00:33:48,711 --> 00:33:50,712
- Oh, he can actually do rap.
- He's good.

509
00:33:50,713 --> 00:33:52,464
- Come on.
- Alright.

Thank you, Joey. Now,
uh, very good, it's going very well.

00:34:41,474 --> 00:34:43,183
Don't go away.

Um, we're going to, uh...

00:34:45,979 --> 00:34:48,188
Uh, yes, come in.

It's us.

00:34:58,783 --> 00:35:00,376
Can I help you?

00:35:12,464 --> 00:35:14,011
Where was I?

535
00:35:18,344 --> 00:35:21,690
Rigoletto is, uh...

00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:26,400
...one of Verdi's, uh, masterpieces.

It's about infidelity.

- No. No...

00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:38,957
Um...

I don't care what we do, really.

544
00:36:32,088 --> 00:36:35,507
Oh! Nobby really ought to
have a go at this pond.

545
00:36:35,508 --> 00:36:37,556
Ugh, it's filthy.

546
00:36:38,802 --> 00:36:40,474
Here we are.

547
00:36:41,846 --> 00:36:45,818
There's Olly. Daisy! Daisy-Jo!

548
00:36:46,852 --> 00:36:48,603
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run!

549
00:36:48,604 --> 00:36:51,481
Look at you!

550
00:36:51,483 --> 00:36:53,985
Give me a hug! Mmmm!

551
00:36:55,027 --> 00:36:57,529
- This is my friend Jean.
- Hello, Jean.

552
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:59,247
Uh, which hand?

553
00:37:00,366 --> 00:37:01,950
That one.

554
00:37:01,951 --> 00:37:03,328
Yes!

555
00:37:03,494 --> 00:37:05,829
Daisy! It's time to go home.

556
00:37:05,829 --> 00:37:07,621
Off you go. Say goodbye.

557
00:37:07,622 --> 00:37:09,622
- Goodbye, Cissy.
- Bye-bye, sweetheart.

558
00:37:09,623 --> 00:37:12,720
- What's your name again?
- Jean.

559
00:37:12,879 --> 00:37:14,552
Bye, Jean.

560
00:37:16,382 --> 00:37:17,929
Bye.

561
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,854
Mm...

562
00:37:23,139 --> 00:37:25,437
Must be lovely to have visitors,
like family.

563
00:37:26,643 --> 00:37:28,485
Will you, Jean, have visitors?

564
00:37:29,521 --> 00:37:32,491
- The grounds are nice.
- Yes. Yes.

565
00:37:36,401 --> 00:37:39,446
I'm not like you, Wilf,
I positively liked getting old.

566
00:37:39,447 --> 00:37:41,865
I think I can say that
I made the transition

567
00:37:41,867 --> 00:37:44,996
from opera singer to old fart
with aplomb.

568
00:37:45,162 --> 00:37:48,414
And then Jean arrives
and shatters everything.

569
00:37:48,415 --> 00:37:51,668
You know, I remember thinking
about you when you got married...

570
00:37:51,835 --> 00:37:54,253
She was always much
more ambitious than you.

571
00:37:54,254 --> 00:37:57,214
Of course she was. She was
more ambitious than everyone.

572
00:37:57,215 --> 00:37:58,966
If I know anything about it...

573
00:37:58,967 --> 00:38:01,760
- What can you know about it?
- I was your best man.

574
00:38:01,761 --> 00:38:05,347
Yeah, of course you were. But you were
married to the same woman for 35 years.

575
00:38:05,348 --> 00:38:06,973
Call me old-fashioned, Wilf,

576
00:38:06,974 --> 00:38:10,194
but did she know you were unfaithful
to her God knows how many times?

577
00:38:11,563 --> 00:38:14,192
You say some very harsh things, Reg.

578
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:16,201
I think I'll have myself a widdle.

579
00:38:20,615 --> 00:38:24,200
And you were right, you know,
I do hate getting older.

580
00:38:24,201 --> 00:38:26,243
I hate every bloody moment of it.

581
00:38:26,244 --> 00:38:30,289
If it isn't piles, it's bloody prostate

582
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:34,214
or peeing five times a night,
if you're lucky.

583
00:38:37,881 --> 00:38:41,217
Ah! Ladies!

584
00:38:41,219 --> 00:38:44,142
You may want to avert your gaze.

585
00:38:44,305 --> 00:38:49,141
A wise man goes when he can,
a fool goes when he must.

586
00:38:49,142 --> 00:38:51,394
Look, here's Jean in all her glory.

587
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:55,522
Oh, Jean. You haven't changed a jot.

588
00:38:55,524 --> 00:38:59,027
Didn't I tell you? Didn't I say
she still looks like a young girl?

589
00:38:59,028 --> 00:39:01,576
Reggie? Don't I get a kiss?

590
00:39:02,782 --> 00:39:04,329
Reg?

591
00:39:05,451 --> 00:39:08,120
I apologise for hurting you.

592
00:39:08,122 --> 00:39:11,331
Please... be kind to me.

593
00:39:11,332 --> 00:39:13,676
We were different people then.

594
00:39:14,709 --> 00:39:19,011
There, I've... I've been
rehearsing that all the past week.

595
00:39:19,172 --> 00:39:21,675
He's upset because he wasn't warned
you were coming.

596
00:39:21,677 --> 00:39:23,223
I'm not upset.

597
00:39:24,429 --> 00:39:26,346
Oh, Reg.

598
00:39:26,347 --> 00:39:31,268
This is the first time we've seen each
other in God knows how many years.

599
00:39:31,269 --> 00:39:34,813
- '97.
- Is it really that long?

600
00:39:34,814 --> 00:39:37,068
God. How time flies.

601
00:39:38,193 --> 00:39:39,902
Oh... A joke!

602
00:39:39,903 --> 00:39:41,903
Cissy!

603
00:39:41,903 --> 00:39:46,079
Bobby, give us a clue, for God's sake.
Is it a book, a film, a play?

604
00:39:46,241 --> 00:39:49,452
Cissy. The note?

605
00:39:49,455 --> 00:39:51,372
I couldn't read your writing.

606
00:39:51,373 --> 00:39:54,000
Meeting, now.

607
00:39:54,001 --> 00:39:56,502
Oh, God. The emergency meeting.

608
00:39:56,503 --> 00:39:59,428
- I wonder what that was all about.
- Where's Reg? Where's Reg?

609
00:40:02,301 --> 00:40:03,928
Reg!

610
00:40:34,041 --> 00:40:35,589
Reg?

611
00:40:39,505 --> 00:40:41,222
Reggie?

612
00:40:45,718 --> 00:40:47,766
Reg, are you in here?

613
00:40:53,896 --> 00:40:56,739
Oh. There you are.

614
00:40:56,899 --> 00:40:58,901
What you doing there?

615
00:40:59,942 --> 00:41:01,483
Leave me in peace, Jean.

616
00:41:01,485 --> 00:41:05,280
God... Oh, dear,
I've walked miles to find you.

617
00:41:05,281 --> 00:41:06,874
Leave me in peace.

618
00:41:08,868 --> 00:41:10,414
Reggie?

619
00:41:11,745 --> 00:41:13,747
Leave!

620
00:41:41,817 --> 00:41:43,610
Can't ever remember
you crying.

621
00:41:43,612 --> 00:41:46,239
I don't remember you
being religious.

622
00:41:46,406 --> 00:41:50,002
I'm not. I was trying to avoid you.

623
00:41:51,036 --> 00:41:53,788
I apologise for hurting you.
Please be kind.

624
00:41:53,788 --> 00:41:56,748
- We were different people then.
- No, you just said that, Jean.

625
00:41:56,749 --> 00:41:58,422
You're repeating yourself.

626
00:41:59,837 --> 00:42:01,384
Oh, God.

627
00:42:02,422 --> 00:42:04,715
Why do we have to get old?

628
00:42:04,716 --> 00:42:06,593
That's what people do.

629
00:42:09,762 --> 00:42:11,806
We have to come to
some arrangement.

630
00:42:11,808 --> 00:42:14,726
I don't want to talk about it.
You're here. I'm here. Trapped.

631
00:42:14,727 --> 00:42:16,519
So what are we going to do?

632
00:42:16,521 --> 00:42:18,195
Grin and bear it.

633
00:42:19,482 --> 00:42:21,233
What happened to
forgive and forget?

634
00:42:32,579 --> 00:42:34,251
This cologne...

635
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:37,299
...takes me back.

636
00:42:41,462 --> 00:42:43,432
It takes me back to you, Reg.

637
00:43:23,838 --> 00:43:27,175
- It's flat.
- I know.

638
00:43:27,176 --> 00:43:29,426
Are there any other pianos?

639
00:43:29,427 --> 00:43:32,306
We will make sure you get a
better one next time, alright?

640
00:43:32,472 --> 00:43:34,765
Have a little go, see how you get on.

641
00:43:34,766 --> 00:43:36,313
OK.

642
00:44:04,963 --> 00:44:06,510
Esme.

643
00:44:08,301 --> 00:44:09,843
Thank you.

644
00:44:09,844 --> 00:44:13,930
- Hello. My name's Isla Mathieson.
- Hello. My name's Iona Mathieson.

645
00:44:13,931 --> 00:44:16,184
- And we'll be playing...
- Go Tell Aunt Rhody.

646
00:45:28,005 --> 00:45:29,679
Would you like to go for a walk?

647
00:45:55,367 --> 00:45:57,244
Were you married four or five times?

648
00:45:57,245 --> 00:45:59,668
I was only married twice.

649
00:45:59,832 --> 00:46:01,504
After you.

650
00:46:02,583 --> 00:46:04,335
Charlie Tripper.

651
00:46:05,586 --> 00:46:07,304
He was a businessman.

652
00:46:08,423 --> 00:46:11,758
Mixed pleasure with business
rather too often.

653
00:46:11,759 --> 00:46:13,511
And Edward...

654
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:18,183
- Fitzroy.
- Yeah.

655
00:46:18,349 --> 00:46:22,946
Yeah. He wanted me to retire, have
a family, so that was the end of that.

656
00:46:27,193 --> 00:46:29,615
- You never married again?
- No.

657
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:33,453
- Why not?
- Didn't want to.

658
00:46:37,578 --> 00:46:40,537
When we did Bohème at the Met
and you backed out,

659
00:46:40,537 --> 00:46:42,079
was that because of me?

660
00:46:42,081 --> 00:46:43,623
Yep.

661
00:46:43,625 --> 00:46:45,548
- And Salzburg?
- Yep.

662
00:46:47,879 --> 00:46:49,553
Oh.

663
00:46:56,931 --> 00:46:58,604
What brought you here?

664
00:46:58,766 --> 00:47:01,310
Um... actually Wilf was ill.

665
00:47:01,311 --> 00:47:03,853
He had a stroke, didn't he?

666
00:47:03,854 --> 00:47:05,813
Yes, it was only a mild one, thankfully.

667
00:47:05,813 --> 00:47:08,648
It's affected
his, um... his frontal lobe

668
00:47:08,649 --> 00:47:10,984
and he has trouble censoring himself.

669
00:47:10,986 --> 00:47:12,953
Is that it?

670
00:47:13,113 --> 00:47:14,822
Well, so he says.

671
00:47:14,823 --> 00:47:17,747
So I came here
to see how Wilf was getting on.

672
00:47:18,827 --> 00:47:20,580
- And stayed.
- Mm.

673
00:47:22,331 --> 00:47:26,292
I loved singing. But I like my life.

674
00:47:26,294 --> 00:47:29,764
You can't have both. Can you?

675
00:47:32,131 --> 00:47:33,884
- No.
- No.

676
00:47:35,676 --> 00:47:37,303
No, you can't.

677
00:47:40,557 --> 00:47:42,350
I've nothing.

678
00:47:42,352 --> 00:47:45,645
Well, my clothes, bit of jewellery

679
00:47:45,646 --> 00:47:47,866
and a hip that gives me hell.

680
00:47:48,192 --> 00:47:50,817
- And here you are.
- Yeah, here I am.

681
00:47:50,818 --> 00:47:53,241
On charity. God,
it's embarrassing.

682
00:47:54,323 --> 00:47:56,407
I wouldn't tell anyone.

683
00:47:56,408 --> 00:47:58,785
I mean, the press
have always been mean to me.

684
00:47:58,952 --> 00:48:03,162
If they learned I'd landed up here,
God, how they'd gloat.

685
00:48:03,163 --> 00:48:05,248
Do the press still have
any interest in you?

686
00:48:05,249 --> 00:48:06,791
- Oh!
- Ow.

687
00:48:06,793 --> 00:48:08,794
Piss off, Reg.

688
00:48:08,795 --> 00:48:11,513
W... Bitch!

689
00:48:11,674 --> 00:48:13,757
There she goes. See her?

690
00:48:13,758 --> 00:48:15,635
Angelique. Bitch!

691
00:48:15,636 --> 00:48:19,013
Cow! Sodding frog!

692
00:48:19,014 --> 00:48:21,098
She won't give me marmalade
at breakfast.

693
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:22,852
She gives me apricot jam.

694
00:48:23,019 --> 00:48:26,437
- Oh. You hate apricot jam.
- Bitch!

695
00:48:26,437 --> 00:48:29,690
- Skinny-arsed French twat.
- Shh.

696
00:48:29,691 --> 00:48:31,614
Stop it, Reggie.

697
00:48:37,782 --> 00:48:41,410
So, Jean, what made
you stop singing?

698
00:48:41,412 --> 00:48:44,758
- You mean for good?
- Yes, for good.

699
00:48:45,917 --> 00:48:50,753
I just became so scared.
Suddenly, the pressure was huge.

700
00:48:50,754 --> 00:48:53,381
I became so aware of the critics,

701
00:48:53,382 --> 00:48:56,258
and the importance
of getting a good review,

702
00:48:56,259 --> 00:49:01,481
that whatever you did had to be good,
or, well, better than before.

703
00:49:03,517 --> 00:49:05,190
And of course it can't be.

704
00:49:06,437 --> 00:49:10,659
I got so nervous, I just...
I just could not sing anymore.

705
00:49:10,817 --> 00:49:13,741
- I just...
- Here. You know this?

706
00:49:17,991 --> 00:49:21,368
'Works of art
are of an infinite loneliness,

707
00:49:21,369 --> 00:49:24,370
and nothing...

708
00:49:24,371 --> 00:49:28,797
...can reach them so little
as criticism.'

709
00:49:43,224 --> 00:49:44,817
We weren't doing anything.

710
00:49:46,061 --> 00:49:47,483
Neither were we.

Where is she?

00:49:55,612 --> 00:49:57,696

715
00:49:57,697 --> 00:49:59,947
Are you planning to do this
at the gala?

Certainly!

717
00:50:00,993 --> 00:50:04,121
Well, I've changed my mind.
I don't think it's sophisticated enough.

718
00:50:04,287 --> 00:50:06,580
What do you mean
it isn't sophisticated enough?

719
00:50:06,581 --> 00:50:09,917
- Exactly what I say. What did I say?
- 'It's not sophisticated enough'.

720
00:50:09,918 --> 00:50:12,091

Have you asked Reggie
to sing that Donna e Mobile?

725
00:50:21,806 --> 00:50:24,264
- God. No, I forgot.
- Good. Don't.

726
00:50:24,265 --> 00:50:26,725
I have a brilliant idea!

What is it?

00:50:28,311 --> 00:50:31,438
Oh, I've forgotten it. Um... er...
You remember it. What was that?

729
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,692
- You haven't said it yet.

- No, you didn't.
- I told you at breakfast!

00:50:35,736 --> 00:50:37,362
- You didn't.
- And you. I've told you.

732
00:50:37,529 --> 00:50:39,738
You were sitting outside with us.
What is it?

Oh, for God's sake, you cretins.

I'll find it eventually.
Go and find Wilf. Go on.

Now, where was I?

Excuse me while I shut
out Tit-Willow, Cedric.

00:51:05,098 --> 00:51:06,766
Terrific. I can explain to you now.

I put it to you
that you should perform at the gala

747
00:51:17,446 --> 00:51:19,487
the quartet from Rigoletto.

748
00:51:19,488 --> 00:51:22,657
That's amazing!
I've... I've just been listening to us.

749
00:51:22,658 --> 00:51:25,660
- The Rigoletto.
- Think of the publicity!

750
00:51:25,662 --> 00:51:28,123
The Times, The Telegraph,
Opera Magazine.

751
00:51:28,123 --> 00:51:32,218
We have four of the finest singers
in English operatic history.

752
00:51:32,377 --> 00:51:35,379
We already know the bloody thing.
We'd hardly have to rehearse.

753
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:37,464
- But Jean won't sing it.
- Put your hand up.

754
00:51:37,465 --> 00:51:40,383
- Put your hand up?
- Oh, but you must change her mind.

755
00:51:40,386 --> 00:51:41,928
She's a huge draw.

756
00:51:41,929 --> 00:51:43,930
Don't you put your
hand up for anyone.

757
00:51:43,931 --> 00:51:46,275
It would be as if Maria Callas
were making a comeback.

758
00:51:46,433 --> 00:51:48,517
I don't think I want to
sing with Jean again.

759
00:51:48,518 --> 00:51:49,602
Why not?

760
00:51:49,603 --> 00:51:51,896
They were married once,
but it didn't work out.

761
00:51:51,897 --> 00:51:54,398
Cissy, please. I don't want to.
It wouldn't be right.

762
00:51:54,399 --> 00:51:56,400
Well, it's a shame.

763
00:51:56,401 --> 00:51:59,487
I can't count the number of galas
you have graced over the years

764
00:51:59,488 --> 00:52:02,116
with your incomparable voice,
and I mean that sincerely.

765
00:52:02,282 --> 00:52:04,032
I don't think you realise it, Reggie,

766
00:52:04,033 --> 00:52:07,494
but people still talk about
your Celeste Aida four years ago

767
00:52:07,495 --> 00:52:09,329
and your Ave Maria two years ago.

768
00:52:09,332 --> 00:52:10,957
For what it's worth,

769
00:52:10,958 --> 00:52:14,920
when I heard you sing Nessun Dorma
at the gala last year,

770
00:52:14,921 --> 00:52:18,641
all I thought was,
'Eat your heart out, Pavarotti.'

771
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,175
Reggie, I know you
don't think much of me,

772
00:52:21,175 --> 00:52:25,137
but with this one concert, we could get
enough money to keep this place going

773
00:52:25,139 --> 00:52:26,723
for the rest of the year.

774
00:52:26,724 --> 00:52:28,892
- Or possibly even the next.
- It's true.

775
00:52:28,893 --> 00:52:31,895
You could help save Beecham House,
Reginald.

776
00:52:31,896 --> 00:52:35,064
But I have an important meeting now.
Do excuse me.

777
00:52:35,065 --> 00:52:38,943
♪ Tit-willow... ♪
- Oh, shut up! For... sakes, shut up!

778
00:52:38,946 --> 00:52:41,572
And you could persuade
Jean to sing.

779
00:52:41,573 --> 00:52:43,917
It's only one gala, Reggie.

780
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:48,921
Why don't the three of us
ask her out to dinner'?

781
00:52:49,079 --> 00:52:51,790
- Well done, Reggie.
- Oh, Reggie!

782
00:52:51,792 --> 00:52:53,543
- Thank you.
- Excellent.

783
00:52:53,544 --> 00:52:56,503
No, I'll, uh... I'll write
her a little note, Cissy,

784
00:52:56,504 --> 00:52:59,422
and perhaps you will be
good enough to deliver it.

785
00:52:59,423 --> 00:53:00,970
Yes.

786
00:53:10,269 --> 00:53:11,817
Sorry.

787
00:53:16,231 --> 00:53:18,826
- Just two favours.
- Exactly what do you propose?

788
00:53:18,985 --> 00:53:22,738
The Swan restaurant. Just
the four of us, Cissy, Reggie and me.

789
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:24,991
If we could convince Jean
to sing at the gala,

790
00:53:24,992 --> 00:53:27,410
we're talking serious money here.

791
00:53:27,411 --> 00:53:30,997
I mean, even Cedric reckons
we could charge Covent Garden prices.

792
00:53:30,998 --> 00:53:32,873
In by 10:30. No later.

793
00:53:32,874 --> 00:53:34,624
- 12:30.
- No.

794
00:53:34,626 --> 00:53:36,294
- You sure?
- Yes.

795
00:53:36,295 --> 00:53:38,638
What kind of cigarettes
is it you smoke again?

796
00:53:45,262 --> 00:53:47,722
- 12:30. No later.
- Done, Lucy.

797
00:53:47,723 --> 00:53:50,098
- Please call me Dr Cogan.
- Done, Dr Cogan.

798
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:53,104
Why is it, Wilfred, I always get the
impression you're up to no good?

799
00:53:53,270 --> 00:53:54,937
Because I'm normally up to no good.

800
00:53:54,938 --> 00:53:56,481
And please, call me Wilf.

801
00:53:56,482 --> 00:53:59,155
We've done this, remember?
You don't have a buttonhole.

802
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:04,113
Why do you persist
in flirting with me, Wilf?

803
00:54:04,114 --> 00:54:07,869
Because you're a cracker,
a thing of beauty.

804
00:54:08,035 --> 00:54:11,537
You're not a bimbo or a chick
or any of those awful things.

805
00:54:11,538 --> 00:54:17,001
You're one of that rarest of species,
you're a woman, Lucy Cogan.

806
00:54:17,003 --> 00:54:20,089
Well, I'm flattered, but I have
professional ethics to uphold.

807
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:23,008
Ah, throw caution to the wind.

808
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:26,929
What if we were
to make beautiful music together?

809
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,804
Your husband would never know.

810
00:54:28,805 --> 00:54:30,557
That's reassuring, Wilf.

811
00:54:30,724 --> 00:54:32,975
- Think about it, huh?
- No, Wilf.

812
00:54:32,976 --> 00:54:36,103
- No-one would ever know.
- I will know, Wilf.

813
00:54:36,105 --> 00:54:40,359
Older man. Vintage wine.
Seasoned wood.

814
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:44,243
- Did you say wood?
- Seasoned.

♪ VERDI:
Bella Figlia dell'Amore

Remember,
wait until she's totally legless

817
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:03,005
before we hit her with it.

818
00:55:03,006 --> 00:55:04,599
Yes. Don't speak till she's legless.

819
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:06,343
- She's coming.
- Legless.

820
00:55:06,345 --> 00:55:08,939
- I should never have agreed to this.
- Here she comes.

821
00:55:10,683 --> 00:55:13,225
She looks fairly alright-ish.

822
00:55:13,227 --> 00:55:14,895
You look lovely, Jean.

Oh. Thank you.

824
00:55:17,648 --> 00:55:20,108
You give a whole new meaning
to the word 'chic'.

825
00:55:20,109 --> 00:55:23,611
- It's so very, very kind of you.
- It's the least we can do.

826
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:25,363
- May I, Jean?
- Thank you.

827
00:55:54,892 --> 00:55:57,644
For you, Jean, a little toast,

828
00:55:57,646 --> 00:56:00,481
from all of us to make
you feel welcome.

829
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:04,112
Oh-oh, now, don't forget you've got
to make eye contact or it's bad luck.

830
00:56:04,279 --> 00:56:06,739
I never heard of anything like that
in my life.

831
00:56:06,741 --> 00:56:08,583
- It's the truth.
- Nonsense.

832
00:56:10,619 --> 00:56:13,037
Jean, do you ever
listen to your old recordings?

833
00:56:13,038 --> 00:56:14,706
- Oh, no. No.
- I do.

834
00:56:14,706 --> 00:56:16,253
I listen to us a lot.

835
00:56:16,416 --> 00:56:18,417
As a matter of fact,

836
00:56:18,418 --> 00:56:20,836
Reggie was meant to be
singing La Donna e Mobile

837
00:56:20,837 --> 00:56:22,378
at the gala concert.

838
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:24,882
- But even more exciting, guess what?
- Shh, shh, shh.

839
00:56:26,133 --> 00:56:27,217
What?

840
00:56:27,218 --> 00:56:29,469
La donna è mobile.
Qual piuma al vento.

841
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:31,690
Women are as fickle
as a feather in the wind.

842
00:56:31,848 --> 00:56:34,600
Oh, I fell in love with you
when I first heard you sing that.

843
00:56:34,602 --> 00:56:36,479
Yeah, that's why I
never sang it again.

844
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,064
I took twelve curtain calls.

845
00:56:39,066 --> 00:56:40,784
No. No, you took nine. I took twelve.

846
00:56:42,692 --> 00:56:44,410
- Stop.
- If you say so.

847
00:56:44,569 --> 00:56:46,153
You know, the other night

848
00:56:46,154 --> 00:56:48,822
I was at the Garden,
I was Sir George's guest,

849
00:56:48,823 --> 00:56:50,949
and I received a standing ovation.

850
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:53,577
Oh, how lovely!

851
00:56:53,579 --> 00:56:55,162
You're doing it again, Jean.

852
00:56:55,163 --> 00:56:57,539
- Doing what?
- Repeating yourself.

853
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:59,084
Oh, what's it matter.

854
00:56:59,085 --> 00:57:02,294
In opera we repeat ourselves
all the time, all the time, all the...

855
00:57:02,295 --> 00:57:04,296
In opera we repeat ourselves
all the time,

856
00:57:04,298 --> 00:57:06,967
- ...repeat ourselves over and over...
- Repetito...

857
00:57:06,968 --> 00:57:08,510
I think you two are drunk.

858
00:57:08,511 --> 00:57:10,053
I think I possibly am,

859
00:57:10,054 --> 00:57:13,223
although I find it very difficult
to tell the difference at this age.

860
00:57:13,224 --> 00:57:15,808
- You always drink.
- Let's have a toast to our quartet.

861
00:57:15,809 --> 00:57:18,528
- To the quartet.
- What quartet?

862
00:57:18,686 --> 00:57:21,688
Cedric wants us all
to sing in the gala concert.

863
00:57:21,690 --> 00:57:23,858
What, us to sing?

864
00:57:23,859 --> 00:57:25,401
He wants us to sing...

865
00:57:25,402 --> 00:57:28,196
The quartet from Rigoletto.

866
00:57:28,197 --> 00:57:29,540
It's such an honour.

867
00:57:29,741 --> 00:57:31,287
It's a great honour, Jean.

868
00:57:32,576 --> 00:57:34,999
- Great honour.
- Very great honour.

869
00:57:36,248 --> 00:57:37,794
The quartet?

870
00:57:38,999 --> 00:57:40,543
Is that why you're...?

871
00:57:40,544 --> 00:57:42,502
I don't want any of this, please.
Please.

872
00:57:42,503 --> 00:57:44,380
Is that why you asked
me for this dinner?

873
00:57:44,547 --> 00:57:46,756
No. We asked you because...

874
00:57:46,757 --> 00:57:48,800
- Well...
- Why?

875
00:57:48,801 --> 00:57:51,474
- Because we love you.
- Aye. Yeah.

876
00:57:59,020 --> 00:58:01,397
Well, I'm not singing in any quartet.

877
00:58:03,901 --> 00:58:06,699
I think you really are despicable.

878
00:58:14,703 --> 00:58:16,249
Phew!

879
00:58:17,414 --> 00:58:18,955

He's fully conscious,
Norma, yes.

Jean?

946
01:03:06,083 --> 01:03:09,042
- It's me, Cissy.
- Just go away, Cissy, please.

947
01:03:09,043 --> 01:03:11,879
I-I know you're upset,
so I brought you some flowers

948
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:13,422
and I picked them myself.

949
01:03:13,422 --> 01:03:14,964
Aren't they lovely? Look.

950
01:03:14,965 --> 01:03:16,841
I thought these
might really cheer you up.

951
01:03:17,010 --> 01:03:19,636
And Nobby doesn't usually
allow us to pick any flowers,

952
01:03:19,637 --> 01:03:22,514
and especially not the ones
in the woodland, not even those.

953
01:03:22,515 --> 01:03:26,101
And I really wanted to get you bluebells
because I know you love bluebells.

954
01:03:26,102 --> 01:03:27,895
Because we talked about
them before.

955
01:03:27,896 --> 01:03:31,150
But I wondered also, would you like
to talk about the quartet?

956
01:03:31,318 --> 01:03:34,235
No! I would not like
to talk about the quartet!

957
01:03:34,236 --> 01:03:35,829
- Oh!
- Get out!

958
01:03:38,282 --> 01:03:40,330
Why did she do that?
Why did she do that?

959
01:03:40,492 --> 01:03:42,165
Ahhh!

960
01:04:26,830 --> 01:04:28,665
Is this my house?

961
01:04:28,668 --> 01:04:30,835
It's a lovely place.

962
01:04:30,836 --> 01:04:33,212
This is Beecham House.

963
01:04:33,212 --> 01:04:35,089
It's not your room.
It's another room.

964
01:04:35,257 --> 01:04:39,260
You've come here to
have a rest, Cissy.

965
01:04:41,930 --> 01:04:43,931
You're... you're...

966
01:04:43,932 --> 01:04:45,515
...my friend.

967
01:04:45,516 --> 01:04:46,891
Sheryl.

968
01:04:46,892 --> 01:04:48,566
Sheryl. Yes.

969
01:04:49,604 --> 01:04:51,605
- Sheryl.
- Mm-hmm.

970
01:04:51,606 --> 01:04:53,153
And this is...?

971
01:04:58,905 --> 01:05:00,578
Reggie.

972
01:05:06,328 --> 01:05:07,870
And, of course,

973
01:05:07,871 --> 01:05:10,875
this is a naughty, naughty man.

974
01:05:11,042 --> 01:05:12,585
Hi, Cissy.

975
01:05:12,586 --> 01:05:14,587
Where's... where's...

976
01:05:14,588 --> 01:05:16,214
...where's my, um...

977
01:05:16,215 --> 01:05:18,388
Where's my... my thing?

978
01:05:18,550 --> 01:05:20,098
I got your bag here, Cissy.

979
01:05:22,012 --> 01:05:23,935
That's my bag.

980
01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:27,141
- This is my...
- Mm-hmm.

981
01:05:27,143 --> 01:05:28,770
Yes.

982
01:05:30,313 --> 01:05:31,564
See?

983
01:05:31,731 --> 01:05:33,272
- That's mine.
- Mm-hmm.

984
01:05:33,273 --> 01:05:37,234
- And what were you listening to?
- Mmm...

985
01:05:37,235 --> 01:05:38,776
What's that?

986
01:05:38,778 --> 01:05:42,282
Cissy... this is our quartet.

987
01:05:42,283 --> 01:05:45,118
You... you've been listening to us.

988
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:47,287
It's new. It's new.

989
01:05:47,288 --> 01:05:48,830
- Mm-hmm.
- Yes.

990
01:05:48,831 --> 01:05:50,504
- This is...
- The one they re-issued.

991
01:05:50,665 --> 01:05:53,759
This is new. Yep. That's mine.

992
01:05:57,923 --> 01:06:01,718
Wilf... Wilf, that's...

993
01:06:01,719 --> 01:06:03,260
...that's my swimming costume.

994
01:06:03,261 --> 01:06:04,929
It certainly is, Cissy.

995
01:06:04,930 --> 01:06:06,523
- Mmm.
- Yes.

996
01:06:07,558 --> 01:06:09,105
Yes.

997
01:06:21,489 --> 01:06:25,369
This... this place is
a concept for me.

998
01:06:25,534 --> 01:06:29,829
Because I've got no husband
and no children.

999
01:06:29,831 --> 01:06:32,499
I've got you.

1000
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:35,085
- Mm.
- Indeed you have, Cissy.

1001
01:06:35,086 --> 01:06:36,633
All of you.

1002
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:46,393
I think she should get some rest.

1003
01:06:49,141 --> 01:06:50,687
Lovely girl.

1004
01:06:51,977 --> 01:06:53,524
Beautifully endowed.

1005
01:06:59,277 --> 01:07:01,821
- Have you seen Cissy?
- Yes.

1006
01:07:01,822 --> 01:07:03,363
How is she?

1007
01:07:03,364 --> 01:07:04,911
- She's...
- Fine.

1008
01:07:29,183 --> 01:07:30,892
I'll come back in the morning.

1009
01:07:30,893 --> 01:07:32,269
Yes, of course, Ms Horton.

1010
01:07:32,437 --> 01:07:34,522
You be sure
to tell her I came to see her.

1011
01:07:34,523 --> 01:07:35,565
Absolutely.

1012
01:07:35,565 --> 01:07:37,274
Jean, is that you?

1013
01:07:37,275 --> 01:07:39,650
I thought I recognised your voice.

1014
01:07:39,651 --> 01:07:41,199
As if one couldn't.

1015
01:07:42,279 --> 01:07:43,826
Frank?

1016
01:07:45,031 --> 01:07:46,574
Frank White!

1017
01:07:46,576 --> 01:07:49,375
It's nothing serious,
just one of my dizzy spells.

1018
01:07:49,537 --> 01:07:51,620
But I won't be taking part in the gala.

1019
01:07:51,621 --> 01:07:55,791
I had no idea you were here.
I would've come to see you earlier.

1020
01:07:55,793 --> 01:07:59,013
Oh, dear, dear Frank.

1021
01:08:00,298 --> 01:08:02,257
I'm sorry you're not well.

1022
01:08:02,258 --> 01:08:04,352
What a fling we had.

1023
01:08:07,388 --> 01:08:09,055
What a fling indeed.

1024
01:08:09,056 --> 01:08:11,558
Short, but giving.

1025
01:08:11,559 --> 01:08:13,105
And that beautiful hotel.

1026
01:08:14,729 --> 01:08:16,823
- You...
- Yes.

1027
01:08:17,940 --> 01:08:19,942
You've been up to
your usual tricks.

1028
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:25,989
Poor Cissy.

1029
01:08:25,991 --> 01:08:28,119
I don't know what came over me.

1030
01:08:28,284 --> 01:08:30,707
I feel so ashamed.

1031
01:08:32,873 --> 01:08:35,876
She does so want to
perform the quartet.

1032
01:08:37,377 --> 01:08:39,505
Jean.

1033
01:08:41,547 --> 01:08:43,265
Take part.

1034
01:08:44,301 --> 01:08:46,886
If you can't sing at the gala,

1035
01:08:46,887 --> 01:08:48,388
do conjuring tricks.

1036
01:08:51,682 --> 01:08:53,225
The only alternative

1037
01:08:53,226 --> 01:08:55,320
is to be guest of honour
at the crematorium.

- Oh, thank you.
- There's some change, Ms Horton.

1047
01:09:34,060 --> 01:09:36,686
No, you keep that.
Could you give this to Mr Paget?

1048
01:09:36,687 --> 01:09:38,234
- Of course I will.
- Thank you.

1049
01:09:39,523 --> 01:09:41,900
It's the only trio
we could come up with, Bobby.

1050
01:09:41,902 --> 01:09:43,494
Are you sure about this, Wilfred?

1051
01:09:43,653 --> 01:09:46,612
Well, the three of us must have
sang the Barber a dozen times.

1052
01:09:46,612 --> 01:09:48,239
You'll need at least six sessions.

1053
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:49,786
- Six?
- Mmm.

1054
01:09:50,868 --> 01:09:52,711
- Who's that from?
- Ms Horton.

1055
01:09:56,625 --> 01:09:58,171
Did she say yes?

1056
01:09:59,795 --> 01:10:02,719
Oh. How good of you to come.

1057
01:10:03,923 --> 01:10:05,470
Please. Please sit down.

1058
01:10:07,051 --> 01:10:08,719
Why don't you sit on the bed, Cissy?

1059
01:10:08,721 --> 01:10:10,519
I have some little gifts for you.

1060
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:12,932
First, I want to apologise,

1061
01:10:12,932 --> 01:10:14,479
especially to you, Cissy.

1062
01:10:15,976 --> 01:10:17,685
What I did to you was appalling,

1063
01:10:17,686 --> 01:10:20,063
and I am... I'm so very sorry.

1064
01:10:20,064 --> 01:10:21,607
Thank you.

1065
01:10:21,608 --> 01:10:23,150
This is for you, Wilf.

1066
01:10:23,153 --> 01:10:24,737
Oh, thank you.

1067
01:10:24,738 --> 01:10:26,911
I don't even remember
you throwing flowers at me.

1068
01:10:28,616 --> 01:10:30,159
This is for you, Reggie.

1069
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:31,331
There.

1070
01:10:33,579 --> 01:10:35,162
I really am very sorry.

1071
01:10:35,163 --> 01:10:36,711
My fault entirely.

1072
01:10:37,999 --> 01:10:39,717
I think I know what it is.

1073
01:10:41,711 --> 01:10:44,504
- Lime marmalade.
- A CD of our Rigoletto.

1074
01:10:44,505 --> 01:10:46,048
How lovely.

1075
01:10:46,049 --> 01:10:49,761
Yes, I know you have copies, but these
are signed, so they're rather valuable.

1076
01:10:49,762 --> 01:10:51,889
And I wrapped them myself.

1077
01:10:52,056 --> 01:10:53,603
I thought perhaps you did.

1078
01:10:55,226 --> 01:10:57,226
- Well, is that it?
- Yes.

1079
01:10:57,227 --> 01:11:00,104
This should do rather well on eBay,
I would imagine.

1080
01:11:00,105 --> 01:11:01,899
Come on, Cissy.

1081
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:04,026
Have you changed your mind
about the gala?

1082
01:11:04,027 --> 01:11:06,486
Well, of course, she hasn't.
I mean, why should she?

1083
01:11:06,487 --> 01:11:10,239
It's only a celebration in honour of the
greatest composer for the human voice

1084
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:12,658
who ever bloody lived, that's all.

1085
01:11:12,659 --> 01:11:14,953
You must understand.
I was someone once.

1086
01:11:14,954 --> 01:11:16,547
I thought I was someone now.

1087
01:11:16,706 --> 01:11:18,581
I can't insult the memory of who I was.

1088
01:11:18,582 --> 01:11:20,541
What are you talking about, memory?

1089
01:11:20,543 --> 01:11:22,126
Whose memory?
Your fans?

1090
01:11:22,128 --> 01:11:25,090
Your fans are dead!
Gone, split, bought the farm!

1091
01:11:25,091 --> 01:11:28,467
Except the ones who've moved in here,
and they're just waiting to die.

1092
01:11:28,468 --> 01:11:32,095
We've all aged. It's crept up
on all of us without us even noticing.

1093
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:34,180
I'm the same old Wilf I always was,

1094
01:11:34,182 --> 01:11:37,517
thankfully, with a little bit of
testosterone to keep me interested.

1095
01:11:37,518 --> 01:11:40,271
Now, I'm gonna say something
that's a wee bit rude to you.

1096
01:11:41,313 --> 01:11:43,442
Just fucking do it!

1097
01:11:45,527 --> 01:11:47,277
My gift deserted me.

1098
01:11:47,278 --> 01:11:49,622
It deserts us all, Jean.
It's called life.

1099
01:11:49,781 --> 01:11:52,408
Oh, my darling.
Old age is not for sissies.

1100
01:11:52,410 --> 01:11:54,162
No.

1101
01:11:55,997 --> 01:11:57,205
Jean?

1102
01:11:57,205 --> 01:11:58,871
Let go.

1103
01:11:58,872 --> 01:12:01,667
What's it matter now
what anyone says or thinks?

1104
01:12:01,668 --> 01:12:03,209
You might even enjoy it.

1105
01:12:03,211 --> 01:12:05,462
Are you telling me
to go out and smell the roses?

1106
01:12:05,463 --> 01:12:07,006
No, I'm telling you to sing.

1107
01:12:07,007 --> 01:12:10,103
The roses are long gone. But the
chrysanthemums are magnificent.

1108
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:11,844
They certainly are, Cissy.

1109
01:12:11,845 --> 01:12:13,846
Jean, if you say yes,

1110
01:12:13,847 --> 01:12:17,141
Cedric will give us the finale
instead of Anne Langley.

1111
01:12:17,143 --> 01:12:19,060
- Anne Langley?
- Yes.

1112
01:12:19,061 --> 01:12:20,859
Yes, she wanted to sing Violetta.

1113
01:12:21,022 --> 01:12:23,148
And she was, of course,
a very fine Violetta.

1114
01:12:23,149 --> 01:12:25,734
Oh, pull yourself together, Cissy.

1115
01:12:25,735 --> 01:12:28,610
Violetta's supposed to be
dying of tuberculosis.

1116
01:12:28,611 --> 01:12:30,779
She sounded as if she
was singing Falstaff.

1117
01:12:30,781 --> 01:12:32,328
Well, she's singing Tosca now.

1118
01:12:37,371 --> 01:12:39,715
Over my dead body.

1119
01:12:43,544 --> 01:12:45,137
Is that a yes?

1120
01:13:04,608 --> 01:13:07,202
So, you decided to sing
in the gala after all.

1121
01:13:07,359 --> 01:13:09,944
Yes, they've persuaded me
to join them in the quartet.

1122
01:13:09,945 --> 01:13:13,490
Really? I would've thought you
would want to sing an aria, dear.

1123
01:13:13,492 --> 01:13:15,743
No, I prefer to sing
with my friends.

1124
01:13:15,743 --> 01:13:18,078
How are your high
notes nowadays?

1125
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:19,745
Just a little shaky, dear.

1126
01:13:19,746 --> 01:13:21,294
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1127
01:13:21,457 --> 01:13:23,417
Now, when I sang Gilda...

1128
01:13:23,418 --> 01:13:25,293
Yes, I heard it was a triumph.

1129
01:13:25,294 --> 01:13:27,420
I remember my mother
telling me about it.

did the same in Britain.

- Hence Beecham House.

Nice. Thank you. Yeah, one more.

Lady Mayoress,
will you come this way, please?

Well, I don't think that's...

1146

Is that going to be
too late in the day for that?

1147
01:17:21,493 --> 01:17:25,579
I'd say something like
'Verdi's Rigoletto is a masterpiece

1148
01:17:25,580 --> 01:17:29,427
and the quartet is one of the great
milestones in the history of opera.'

1149
01:17:29,585 --> 01:17:31,127
Now, look at that. Perfect.

1150
01:17:31,128 --> 01:17:33,547
And then I'll introduce
each of us in turn.

1151
01:17:33,548 --> 01:17:35,089
No, wait a minute, Reggie.

1152
01:17:35,090 --> 01:17:36,924
- What?
- I'll go on last.

1153
01:17:36,924 --> 01:17:38,841
I'm sure we can live with that.

1154
01:17:38,842 --> 01:17:40,385
We certainly can, yes.

1155
01:17:40,386 --> 01:17:42,012
- I remember.
- What?

1156
01:17:42,013 --> 01:17:43,805
I've got to do Anne
Langley's make-up.

1157
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:46,976
It's not make-up she needs.
It's a paper-hanging job.

1158
01:17:46,978 --> 01:17:50,189
- That's very naughty, Jean.
- And very true.

1159
01:17:50,190 --> 01:17:53,775
Make it nice and tight. Make sure the
middle bit's tight so it stays that way.

1160
01:17:53,776 --> 01:17:55,653
'Cause it ends up listing to starboard.

1161
01:17:55,819 --> 01:17:57,820
No, no, no. I promise you...

1162
01:17:57,822 --> 01:17:59,365
This too much, Reg?

1163
01:17:59,366 --> 01:18:01,408
Do you think it's too much?

1164
01:18:01,409 --> 01:18:03,034
No, no. Lovely.

1165
01:18:03,034 --> 01:18:05,160
Well, I don't think it'll work.

1166
01:18:05,161 --> 01:18:06,959
I do.

1167
01:18:10,250 --> 01:18:11,793
Hello, good afternoon.

1168
01:18:11,795 --> 01:18:13,796
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

1169
01:18:13,797 --> 01:18:15,713
Welcome to Beecham House

1170
01:18:15,714 --> 01:18:18,934
and our annual gala in honour
of Giuseppe Verdi's birthday.

1171
01:18:19,095 --> 01:18:21,887
First of all, I would like
to express our debt of gratitude

1172
01:18:21,888 --> 01:18:25,390
to the amazing Mr Cedric Livingstone
for organising the event.

1173
01:18:25,391 --> 01:18:27,434
Thank you so much.

1174
01:18:27,436 --> 01:18:29,561
Thank you, thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

1175
01:18:29,561 --> 01:18:31,437
Let me just say, in all modesty,

1176
01:18:31,438 --> 01:18:35,274
that all great artists
need a great director, you know.

1177
01:18:35,275 --> 01:18:36,869
And I... Here I am.

1178
01:18:37,028 --> 01:18:39,571
Well said!

1179
01:18:39,572 --> 01:18:41,665
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1180
01:18:43,076 --> 01:18:44,285
Thank you.

1181
01:18:44,286 --> 01:18:46,745
This year,
in aid of our rebuilding program,

1182
01:18:46,747 --> 01:18:48,373
you have all given so generously,

1183
01:18:48,374 --> 01:18:50,502
and we thank you for that
with all our hearts.

1184
01:18:50,668 --> 01:18:53,503
And, because of that,
the quartet and you have done it.

1185
01:18:53,504 --> 01:18:55,346
Beecham House lives on!

1186
01:19:06,350 --> 01:19:09,643
I'd also like to thank all those
taking part in the gala itself.

1187
01:19:09,645 --> 01:19:11,521
The preparations and rehearsals

1188
01:19:11,522 --> 01:19:13,565
have kept everybody busy
and very excited

1189
01:19:13,566 --> 01:19:14,909
for the past few months.

1190
01:19:15,109 --> 01:19:18,902
I and all my staff here
feel highly privileged

1191
01:19:18,904 --> 01:19:22,157
to have in our care
such talented performers,

1192
01:19:22,157 --> 01:19:25,284
gifted musicians
who seem to find renewed energy

1193
01:19:25,286 --> 01:19:27,870
when they anticipate
performing before an audience.

1194
01:19:27,871 --> 01:19:29,419
It keeps them young.

1195
01:19:31,251 --> 01:19:34,043
And, actually, let me
just say something else, if I may,

1196
01:19:34,044 --> 01:19:35,761
before we start.

1197
01:19:36,922 --> 01:19:39,590
I, and all my staff here
at Beecham House,

1198
01:19:39,592 --> 01:19:43,347
we owe those in our charge
an enormous debt.

1199
01:19:44,763 --> 01:19:46,481
They inspire us.

1200
01:19:46,641 --> 01:19:50,728
Their love of life, as you well know,
is infectious,

1201
01:19:50,728 --> 01:19:53,270
and gives us all faith in the future.

1202
01:19:53,272 --> 01:19:54,865
I mean that.

1203
01:19:55,901 --> 01:19:57,493
Thank you so much.

1204
01:20:05,201 --> 01:20:06,704

1230
01:22:16,209 --> 01:22:17,837
in the '60s in Covent Garden?

1231
01:22:17,838 --> 01:22:18,879
Yeah?

1232
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:20,672
Who was that big, fat, mezzo-soprano

1233
01:22:20,673 --> 01:22:23,091
who was doing it with a little tenor
in the bathtub?

1234
01:22:23,092 --> 01:22:25,265
She got suctioned in.
What was her name?

1235
01:22:25,426 --> 01:22:26,968
I can't remember.

1236

The wee guy couldn't get out!

1237
01:22:29,723 --> 01:22:31,724
She was Italian.

1238
01:22:31,725 --> 01:22:34,604
The tenor had to dial
the emergency services.

1239
01:22:36,563 --> 01:22:38,104
What was her name?

1240
01:22:38,105 --> 01:22:40,857
Oh, uh... uh...
Elizabeta Botticelli.

1241
01:22:40,858 --> 01:22:43,452
That's it. Elizabeta Botticelli.

1242
01:22:43,612 --> 01:22:46,282
They say her high notes

you married? - Nine hours.

We were together for
about a year,

1268
01:24:16,957 --> 01:24:19,751
and he finally got down on his knees
and asked me to marry him

1269
01:24:19,752 --> 01:24:22,211
and I said yes,
he's very old-fashioned.

1270
01:24:22,213 --> 01:24:24,214
- He still is.
- I know.

1271
01:24:24,215 --> 01:24:26,299
And we were gonna get married
in the January

1272
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:28,093
and then I got that offer
from La Scala.

I remember that. I remember.

1274
01:24:30,304 --> 01:24:33,847
But when I was at La Scala, I had...

1275
01:24:33,848 --> 01:24:35,933
...I had a fling with a tenor.

1276
01:24:35,934 --> 01:24:38,019
Why on earth would you do that?

1277
01:24:38,020 --> 01:24:40,897
Because I'd had too much
champagne. I was pissed.

1278
01:24:40,898 --> 01:24:43,992
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

What's his name, that tenor?

1281
01:24:51,743 --> 01:24:53,962
I know who you mean.
Roberto di Angelis.

1282
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:57,163
- But he was so persuasive.
- I know.

1283
01:24:57,164 --> 01:24:59,087
Anyway, we came back.

1284
01:25:00,126 --> 01:25:02,085
We had this wonderful
wedding breakfast,

1285
01:25:02,085 --> 01:25:04,670
champagne and scrambled eggs.

1286
01:25:04,672 --> 01:25:07,221
And I told him about Roberto.

1287
01:25:08,258 --> 01:25:10,092
Why on earth did you do that?

1288
01:25:10,093 --> 01:25:11,637
I wanted to be honest.

1289
01:25:11,639 --> 01:25:13,766
Anyway, he was very angry.

1290
01:25:13,933 --> 01:25:15,516
- So he walked out?
- He ran.
