1
00:01:28,639 --> 00:01:30,390
Wake up, God damn it!

2
00:01:31,767 --> 00:01:33,727
I know it's hard.

3
00:01:33,769 --> 00:01:37,772
Your eyes is burning,
slowly opening.

4
00:01:37,856 --> 00:01:41,192
You slowly realizing
that this wasn't no dream.

5
00:01:41,275 --> 00:01:43,194
No, this is your life.

6
00:02:29,903 --> 00:02:34,157
Yeah, right about now
you're looking at them
cold walls that surround you,

7
00:02:34,241 --> 00:02:37,619
and you wondering,
"How the hell did I get up
in this joint, Jack?

8
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:40,288
"And how the fuck
I'm gonna get out?"

9
00:02:55,218 --> 00:02:56,970
(BUZZING)

10
00:03:01,307 --> 00:03:04,560
But you know what they say:
"It's like life, y'all.

11
00:03:04,644 --> 00:03:07,271
PETEY ON P. A... :
"Ain't no way to it,
but to do it. "

12
00:03:08,564 --> 00:03:12,442
So reach on up there
and scratch another day
off the wall, man.

13
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,361
But don't be whining.

14
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:15,528
Uh-uh.

15
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,989
Ain't gonna be no signal fire.

16
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:19,699
Just take a stand.

17
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:21,451
Be a man.
It's good to see you, man.

18
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,828
And try to understand.
Hey, listen, man. Listen.

19
00:03:23,911 --> 00:03:25,871
You ain't in here
'cause of the master's plan.

20
00:03:25,913 --> 00:03:28,207
No, you in here
'cause you fucked up!

21
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,878
Look, this is the nigga
that I've been writing
you about. You dig?

22
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:36,089
Yo, I was reading my court
papers the other day, y'all.

23
00:03:36,172 --> 00:03:41,594
They say, "Ralph Waldo
'Petey' Greene versus
the United States of America."

24
00:03:41,636 --> 00:03:45,097
I say, "Goddamn!
No wonder I'm up
in this motherfucker!"

25
00:03:46,432 --> 00:03:49,685
So I'm gonna dedicate
this next one to my baby.

26
00:03:50,602 --> 00:03:54,231
Man, she gonna be up here
in a minute, and this gal,
Lord have mercy,

27
00:03:54,314 --> 00:03:56,107
she's fine as frogs, yeah.

28
00:03:56,191 --> 00:04:00,028
So while this is playing,
I want y'all to think about
the one y'all love.

29
00:04:00,111 --> 00:04:02,113
And I'm talking about the one
sends you them pictures, man,

30
00:04:02,196 --> 00:04:04,448
not the cat in the next bunk.

31
00:04:05,408 --> 00:04:07,952
I guess you're pretty hard up
for entertainment around here.

32
00:04:08,035 --> 00:04:10,078
Yeah, man. This is prison.

33
00:04:10,162 --> 00:04:12,956
Whatever gets you through
twenty-to-life.

34
00:04:17,252 --> 00:04:18,878
I got a meeting.

35
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:21,339
You...

36
00:04:24,508 --> 00:04:26,802
You need anything?
I don't need shit.

37
00:04:26,886 --> 00:04:28,012
Okay.

38
00:04:29,179 --> 00:04:32,015
Let me ask you something.
Why do you even bother?

39
00:04:32,099 --> 00:04:34,101
Because I promised Mama.

40
00:04:37,353 --> 00:04:39,647
Don't do me no fucking favors.

41
00:04:58,373 --> 00:05:00,333
(BUZZING)

42
00:05:04,045 --> 00:05:05,629
Hello, Vernell.

43
00:05:10,717 --> 00:05:12,594
That's the booty line.

44
00:05:13,553 --> 00:05:14,513
Conjugal visits.

45
00:05:16,723 --> 00:05:18,850
(VERNELL EXCLAIMING)

46
00:05:24,563 --> 00:05:27,775
Hay. Hey, Radio man! Hey!

47
00:05:29,401 --> 00:05:31,528
So Milo been telling you
about me, huh?

48
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:32,696
What?

49
00:05:33,071 --> 00:05:35,156
Milo. Your brother?

50
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,076
Said y'all need a new DJ
at that radio station.

51
00:05:38,451 --> 00:05:39,702
Hey, I'm your man.

52
00:05:39,786 --> 00:05:41,704
My brother wouldn't know.

53
00:05:41,746 --> 00:05:44,915
And in case you forgot,
you're in prison.

54
00:05:45,207 --> 00:05:46,333
It's a minor challenge.

55
00:05:46,417 --> 00:05:47,960
You're a miscreant.

56
00:05:48,752 --> 00:05:51,004
That's more than
a minor challenge.

57
00:05:51,088 --> 00:05:53,048
The fuck this nigga call me?
A Miss who?

58
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,591
A miscreant.

59
00:05:54,758 --> 00:05:56,134
A convict.

60
00:05:56,676 --> 00:05:58,136
(LAUGHING)

61
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,889
Listen to this nigga!
I'm a miscreant!

62
00:06:01,931 --> 00:06:03,975
Well, you know what?
I like that shit!

63
00:06:04,058 --> 00:06:06,435
'Cause that makes me sound
like a con with class.

64
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:09,229
Hey, Ralph Waldo
"Petey" Greene,

65
00:06:09,313 --> 00:06:10,939
miscreant mack
at your service.

66
00:06:10,981 --> 00:06:13,442
You forgot "felon."

67
00:06:13,734 --> 00:06:14,985
"Lowlife."

68
00:06:15,986 --> 00:06:18,571
So do that mean
I got a job or what?

69
00:06:18,655 --> 00:06:21,032
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

70
00:06:21,657 --> 00:06:24,160
I need you to do me a favor,
sugar. Okay?

71
00:06:24,201 --> 00:06:27,121
I need you to go home
and take this

72
00:06:27,162 --> 00:06:29,915
right on down to Nighthawk
for me, okay?

73
00:06:30,749 --> 00:06:31,875
Here.

74
00:06:32,668 --> 00:06:33,794
Here!

75
00:06:33,877 --> 00:06:35,587
Come on, take it!

76
00:06:36,212 --> 00:06:37,213
Here!

77
00:06:38,256 --> 00:06:39,799
Ain't no padding in there,
sweetie.

78
00:06:39,882 --> 00:06:42,009
You tell him
it's all me, okay?

79
00:06:42,093 --> 00:06:43,386
PETEY: Vernell.

80
00:06:44,095 --> 00:06:46,305
What?
You don't get your ass
in that room...

81
00:06:46,347 --> 00:06:47,640
Oh, shut up.
It's just a bra.

82
00:06:47,723 --> 00:06:49,475
Hey, radio man!

83
00:06:49,516 --> 00:06:50,559
You better come on!

84
00:06:50,642 --> 00:06:52,352
I'm gonna look you up
when I get out of here, man.

85
00:06:52,436 --> 00:06:54,104
Yeah?
How many years you pulling?

86
00:06:54,187 --> 00:06:55,230
Five to ten.

87
00:06:55,313 --> 00:06:57,899
Nickel to a dime.
It ain't shit, baby.

88
00:06:57,982 --> 00:06:59,150
You do that.

89
00:06:59,192 --> 00:07:02,487
I'm the best there is, baby.
I'm the greatest!

90
00:07:02,528 --> 00:07:05,114
I'm the greatest
of all time, baby!

91
00:07:07,366 --> 00:07:09,618
NIGHTHAWK: This is
The Nighthawk Show,

92
00:07:09,701 --> 00:07:14,122
doing it for all those
fine young things
down at Howard University.

93
00:07:14,539 --> 00:07:17,709
The Love Hawk
with you all night,

94
00:07:17,792 --> 00:07:20,670
rocking your radio
in the nation's capital.

95
00:07:21,295 --> 00:07:26,091
It's 5:10 on the
Sounds of Soul, the big O-L.

96
00:07:26,175 --> 00:07:28,677
We keep losing ground to WOOK.

97
00:07:29,386 --> 00:07:32,764
We can make up the lost ground
on OK, sir. I mean,
we have a very exciting slate.

98
00:07:32,848 --> 00:07:35,058
Great music, talk...
Sounds good,
but it's not working.

99
00:07:35,141 --> 00:07:36,643
What's the problem?

100
00:07:36,726 --> 00:07:38,770
The problem is we've lost
touch with the real DC

101
00:07:38,853 --> 00:07:41,439
in our attempts
to win over the Beltway.

102
00:07:41,522 --> 00:07:43,608
This has always been
a station of the people

103
00:07:43,691 --> 00:07:46,068
and in case you forgot,
most of the people
don't live in Georgetown.

104
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,736
Yeah, but the people who live
in Georgetown

105
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,322
do shop at Giant Foods
and Woody's.

106
00:07:50,405 --> 00:07:51,782
Sponsors that pay your salary.

107
00:07:51,865 --> 00:07:55,243
No. I pay his salary,
and yours.

108
00:07:56,703 --> 00:07:59,747
Maybe I should start paying
your salary to him.

109
00:08:00,915 --> 00:08:03,125
Sir, I think...
I'm serious.

110
00:08:03,501 --> 00:08:05,419
What do you say, Dewey?

111
00:08:05,836 --> 00:08:08,422
You think
you can turn us around?

112
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:10,716
Yes sir, I do.
Good.

113
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,301
Let's give it a try.

114
00:08:16,054 --> 00:08:17,430
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

115
00:08:17,514 --> 00:08:20,600
MAN: Sir, I just need
a minute of your time, please.

116
00:08:20,892 --> 00:08:24,895
PETEY. : Hey, y'all, guess what?
I found out today
I ain't a con, y'all.

117
00:08:24,979 --> 00:08:26,272
For real.

118
00:08:26,647 --> 00:08:31,276
I am not a con,
or a felon, or a thug.

119
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,613
No. I am a miscreant.

120
00:08:34,654 --> 00:08:35,947
(LAUGHS)

121
00:08:35,989 --> 00:08:37,615
Now, y'all know what that is?
Good morning.

122
00:08:37,657 --> 00:08:41,327
That's a con, brother.
A felon, a thug.

123
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,996
We ain't in prison.

124
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,957
No, this
a correctional facility.

125
00:08:46,999 --> 00:08:50,711
See, when you broke into
that car, or shot that nigga,

126
00:08:50,794 --> 00:08:53,505
it wasn't 'cause you
a wrong-doing
motherfucker, no.

127
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,216
No, see,
you troubled, brother.

128
00:08:56,299 --> 00:08:58,218
You disenfranchised.

to face the truth.

no matter how many ways
you try to slice it,

Warden's got a little dick!

136
00:09:27,703 --> 00:09:30,205
Yeah! Come on, Warden!
What you got?

137
00:09:31,206 --> 00:09:32,207
You got that little dick?

138
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:34,084
Who the hell is that man
on my tower?

Hey, Warden! You got a little,
itty-bitty dick! That's right!
That's you, Warden!

142
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:45,428
Shoot him.
Sir?

143
00:09:45,511 --> 00:09:47,304
Right between the eyes.

144
00:09:47,388 --> 00:09:49,932
I don't know
if we can do that, legally.

145
00:09:50,015 --> 00:09:52,851
Technically,
he's not trying to escape.

146
00:09:52,934 --> 00:09:55,061
Well, where in hell
can I shoot him, then?
Listen here!

147
00:09:55,145 --> 00:09:58,690
I want Petey Greene!

148
00:09:58,773 --> 00:10:00,692
You hear me, Warden?

149
00:10:00,775 --> 00:10:04,278
I want you to get Petey Greene
out here, right now.

150
00:10:05,613 --> 00:10:08,240

152
00:10:10,951 --> 00:10:12,077
Where Petey at?

153
00:10:12,119 --> 00:10:14,287
Oh, yo, Petey!

00:10:16,706 --> 00:10:19,459
Yeah. Look,
you got a little dick!

00:26:16,294 --> 00:26:21,132
Or maybe you're sweating
'cause you know that even
if you give it your best shot,

465
00:26:21,674 --> 00:26:24,260
you still might
leave 'em standing.

466
00:26:24,885 --> 00:26:28,597
'Cause this ain't
Lorton anymore.
This is the real world.

467
00:26:31,391 --> 00:26:33,560
And you ain't shit out here.

468
00:26:35,437 --> 00:26:37,021
Are you through?

469
00:26:37,772 --> 00:26:39,565
Knock 'em down, champ.

470
00:26:46,739 --> 00:26:48,991
MAN: All right.
Come on. Come on.
PETEY: Baby.

471
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:50,909
MAN 1: Yeah.
MAN 2: There it go!

472
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:53,412
Damn!

473
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:56,998
Too bad, big time.

474
00:26:58,541 --> 00:27:00,335
I had faith in you.

475
00:27:03,379 --> 00:27:05,005
(CHATTERING)

476
00:27:05,548 --> 00:27:08,133
One ball, corner.

477
00:27:12,554 --> 00:27:15,390
Two ball, side pocket.

478
00:27:18,851 --> 00:27:21,270
Three ball, corner.

479
00:27:23,648 --> 00:27:25,608
See, negroes always think that
if you speak correct English,

480
00:27:25,691 --> 00:27:28,235
or you wear clothes
other than clown suits,

481
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:29,278
that you're not real.

482
00:27:29,528 --> 00:27:31,655
Four ball, side pocket.

483
00:27:34,115 --> 00:27:37,285
And to you, what's real is
a nigga loud-mouthing, right?

484
00:27:37,327 --> 00:27:41,914
Telling everybody
how bad he is while
he's looking for a handout.

485
00:27:42,248 --> 00:27:43,416
Five.

486
00:27:45,418 --> 00:27:48,170
But you give him a chance
to take what's his,

487
00:27:48,921 --> 00:27:51,381
and he can't sink
one single ball.

488
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:52,591
Six.

489
00:27:58,388 --> 00:27:59,806
Lucky seven!

490
00:28:00,932 --> 00:28:02,433
(PEOPLE EXCLAIMING)

491
00:28:02,725 --> 00:28:04,310
Now, you were so busy
running your mouth,

492
00:28:04,393 --> 00:28:08,355
you never really asked
yourself why I chose
a pool hall to meet.

493
00:28:08,439 --> 00:28:12,651
'Cause this uppity nigga
could never have grown up
in these projects,

494
00:28:13,527 --> 00:28:15,362
or made his way through school

495
00:28:15,403 --> 00:28:18,740
hustling dumbass niggas
who thought he wasn't down.

496
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,666
They call me Mr. Hughes.

497
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:41,052
Grew up
in the Anacostia projects.

498
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:51,061
This con climbed the tower
in the yard back in Lorton.

499
00:28:51,144 --> 00:28:53,188
He up there, man,
he's talking real...

500
00:28:53,271 --> 00:28:55,607
You know, unflattering
about the warden's dick.

501
00:28:55,649 --> 00:28:57,650
Nobody could talk
this cat down.

502
00:28:57,734 --> 00:28:59,110
So they call Petey Greene,
man,

503
00:28:59,193 --> 00:29:01,571
I talked this cat down
in five minutes, man.

504
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,740
Let's just say the warden was
very, very grateful.

505
00:29:04,782 --> 00:29:06,325
Five minutes, huh?
Mmm-hmm.

506
00:29:06,992 --> 00:29:08,660
But what the warden don't know

507
00:29:08,744 --> 00:29:13,457
is it took me six months
to talk that crazy nigga
up there in the first place!

508
00:29:19,254 --> 00:29:21,255
Let me ask you something.

509
00:29:23,007 --> 00:29:24,425
Why?

510
00:29:24,842 --> 00:29:28,887
Why you want to be on
the radio so bad that you're
gonna go through all this?

511
00:29:28,971 --> 00:29:32,683
Oh, man, it's what I do, man.
It's my thing, you know?

512
00:29:32,766 --> 00:29:36,186
I started off making
them daily announcements
back at Lorton

513
00:29:36,269 --> 00:29:40,148
as part of the work program,
you know?
A reward for good behavior.

514
00:29:40,732 --> 00:29:43,150
Couple years later,
I convinced them
to let me play this record

515
00:29:43,192 --> 00:29:46,612
that my Aunt Pig had sent me,
a Sam Cooke record, man,
A Change Is Gonna Come.

516
00:29:47,404 --> 00:29:48,530
That's an incredible song.

517
00:29:48,614 --> 00:29:52,576
She sent me that record,
you know, to try and give me
a little hope,

518
00:29:52,659 --> 00:29:54,494
and I wanted to play it
for the men in them cells,

519
00:29:54,536 --> 00:29:56,329
you know, give them some hope.

520
00:29:56,413 --> 00:29:58,456
And I'm telling you, man,

521
00:29:58,665 --> 00:30:03,377
it's the only thing that kept
me from going stone-crazy
behind them walls, man.

522
00:30:03,878 --> 00:30:06,130
And now that I'm out,
I still need that.

523
00:30:06,213 --> 00:30:09,007
Why should I put
my ass on the line
to give you a shot, Petey?

524
00:30:09,049 --> 00:30:12,219
Nigga...
'Cause Petey Greene is
the real deal, Jack!

525
00:30:12,302 --> 00:30:17,390
Shit! I swear to God,
I mean, he is the sho'nuff,
I mean, pimp...

526
00:30:19,225 --> 00:30:20,852
Sorry.
It's okay.

527
00:30:20,893 --> 00:30:24,021
See, what this pretty lady
is trying to tell you is that,

528
00:30:24,105 --> 00:30:26,398
man, being a DJ, that's
the only thing I'm good at

529
00:30:26,482 --> 00:30:29,026
that don't involve me
breaking no law.

530
00:30:30,068 --> 00:30:33,196
And shit, since you here
sharing a drink,

531
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:37,117
I'm gonna assume
that you need a man
of my particular talents.

532
00:30:39,494 --> 00:30:41,037
Three rules.

533
00:30:42,121 --> 00:30:43,331
One,

534
00:30:43,914 --> 00:30:46,292
always know
more than your audience.

535
00:30:46,375 --> 00:30:49,044
Two, you talk shit,
you back it up.

536
00:30:49,086 --> 00:30:51,088
And three, don't you ever,

537
00:30:52,255 --> 00:30:53,381
never, ever,

538
00:30:53,465 --> 00:30:55,383
underestimate me again.

539
00:30:55,925 --> 00:30:57,552
What are you talking about,
man?

540
00:30:57,635 --> 00:31:01,431
I'm gonna give you
one more chance
to knock in that nine ball.

541
00:31:01,514 --> 00:31:06,185
Tomorrow morning, 9:00 a.m.,
WOL, Studio One. Be on time.

542
00:31:07,853 --> 00:31:09,188
Be sober.

543
00:31:09,938 --> 00:31:11,148
And definitely

544
00:31:12,607 --> 00:31:14,192
be by yourself.

545
00:31:14,276 --> 00:31:15,360
(STAMMERING)

546
00:31:15,443 --> 00:31:17,779
You my kind of nigga, Hughes!

547
00:31:17,862 --> 00:31:19,572
You my kind of motherfucker,
Hughes!

548
00:31:19,614 --> 00:31:22,200
We love you!
We love you!

549
00:31:22,283 --> 00:31:23,618
Oh my God!

550
00:31:23,701 --> 00:31:25,703
(EXCLAIMING)

551
00:31:26,453 --> 00:31:28,580
We need to make
a personnel change.

552
00:31:28,664 --> 00:31:30,415
Really? Who?

553
00:31:30,499 --> 00:31:31,833
Sunny Jim.

554
00:31:32,626 --> 00:31:33,919
You're not serious.

555
00:31:34,002 --> 00:31:37,213
Sir, morning shows
are becoming more than
just a leisurely stroll.

556
00:31:37,297 --> 00:31:38,548
We have to compete here.

557
00:31:38,631 --> 00:31:40,466
WOOK is killing us
in the morning.

558
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:43,302
But Sunny Jim is a DC icon!

559
00:31:43,386 --> 00:31:46,639
Everyone loves Sunny Jim.
He's so sunny.

560
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,057
No sir, you love Sunny Jim.

561
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:50,934
Sunny Jim is a relic
of a bygone radio age.

562
00:31:51,018 --> 00:31:52,978
We don't play Nat "King" Cole
or The Drifters anymore.

563
00:31:53,061 --> 00:31:54,604
And our DJ's have
to reflect that.

564
00:31:54,688 --> 00:31:57,273
That's why we have Nighthawk
and Soul Papa.

565
00:31:57,357 --> 00:32:00,651
I'm not turning this into
some kind of teenybopper
American Bandstand.

566
00:32:00,693 --> 00:32:02,486
We're a respectable
R&B station.

567
00:32:02,528 --> 00:32:05,990
With all due respect, sir,
this is not
a respectable town.

568
00:32:06,031 --> 00:32:07,491
This is DC.

569
00:32:07,533 --> 00:32:08,909
You see them out
on the mall every day,

570
00:32:08,992 --> 00:32:11,453
protesting the so-called
respectable establishment.

571
00:32:11,536 --> 00:32:15,123
We can't become
the establishment,
or they'll turn on us.

572
00:32:22,171 --> 00:32:23,339
Who do you have in mind?

573
00:32:23,381 --> 00:32:25,966
Well, sir, I found a DJ
from an out-of-town station.

574
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:28,344
He has a major following,

575
00:32:28,385 --> 00:32:31,972
and he's recently
been released

576
00:32:32,055 --> 00:32:33,723
from his contract.

577
00:32:38,895 --> 00:32:42,148
Jim, come back here, please.
It's nothing personal.

578
00:32:43,357 --> 00:32:45,526
Oh, shit! I'm sorry...

579
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:47,194
Watch where the hell
you're going!

580
00:32:47,278 --> 00:32:48,737
All right, man.

581
00:32:49,738 --> 00:32:51,865
Oh, no.
PETEY: Hey, sugar!

582
00:32:51,948 --> 00:32:54,034
You know the drill.
Call your man.

583
00:32:54,117 --> 00:32:55,493
I don't think so.

584
00:32:55,577 --> 00:32:56,995
Let me ask you something.

585
00:32:57,078 --> 00:32:58,746
You ever had anybody
eat your pussy?

586
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:00,081
Mr. Sonderling!

587
00:33:02,416 --> 00:33:04,251
What's wrong, Freda?

588
00:33:04,752 --> 00:33:07,296
Oh, God.
Blue Blazes.
How the radio business?

589
00:33:07,379 --> 00:33:09,173
I put up with your
shenanigans out front

590
00:33:09,256 --> 00:33:10,924
for a week, Mr. Brown.
Greene.

591
00:33:10,966 --> 00:33:12,968
All right, Mr. Green,
what do you want now?

592
00:33:13,051 --> 00:33:14,594
I'm your DJ, man!

593
00:33:14,678 --> 00:33:16,096
Freda, call the police.

594
00:33:16,137 --> 00:33:19,974
God damn! Y'all got
some hospitality issues
around this motherfucker!

595
00:33:20,058 --> 00:33:21,934
You're cutting it close.

596
00:33:21,976 --> 00:33:24,854
What can I say, man?
Had to get my vine together.

597
00:33:24,937 --> 00:33:26,272
Your vine?
Yeah.

598
00:33:26,355 --> 00:33:27,690
You're going on the...

599
00:33:27,773 --> 00:33:28,732
Fuck.

600
00:33:29,233 --> 00:33:30,776
Mr. Sonderling,

601
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:34,529
this is our new morning DJ.

602
00:33:40,576 --> 00:33:41,786
I've been hoodwinked!

603
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:43,954
Come on.

604
00:33:44,038 --> 00:33:48,459
You are out of your mind
if you think I'm gonna put
this person on the air.

605
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,751
Sir, I know
this is unorthodox...

606
00:33:49,835 --> 00:33:51,336
Unorthodox? It's insane!

607
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:53,296
Sir, hear me out.
This man has a unique voice.

608
00:33:53,338 --> 00:33:55,590
I just have a feeling...
I have much more
than just a feeling.

609
00:33:55,674 --> 00:33:58,468
Sir, we need to put somebody
on the air in the next
two minutes or we go black.

610
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:00,636
Black, black, black.

611
00:34:04,015 --> 00:34:06,308
Freda, run after Jim, he might
still be in the building!

612
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:07,726
Sir, we don't have time.

613
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:10,604
You're just gonna have
to trust me. One show.

614
00:34:11,521 --> 00:34:12,856
One shot.

615
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:17,610
Our morning show's already
in the toilet.

616
00:34:17,694 --> 00:34:20,154
We don't have a thing to lose.
You don't have
a thing to lose!

617
00:34:20,238 --> 00:34:23,157
FREDA ON INTERCOM. :
Sir, it's one minute to air,

an eighth-grade education
with a Ph.D. From the streets.

720

I gotta apologize about
something that I said a little
earlier that upset some folks.

I gotta apologize
to Mr. Berry Gordy

722
00:40:23,237 --> 00:40:26,282
for making him out
to be a hustler and a pimp.

723
00:40:27,533 --> 00:40:31,995
Mr. Gordy's
a very important man,
and he's done a great deal.

724
00:40:34,539 --> 00:40:38,293
And I love the way
he takes the little
brothers and sisters,

00:40:39,043 --> 00:40:42,880
broke-down runaways,
the downtrodden
from the projects,

726
00:40:42,922 --> 00:40:45,382
and he gets them
off the streets.

727
00:40:45,716 --> 00:40:49,928
Then he puts a few dollars
in their pockets, teaches them
how to talk and how to walk,

728
00:40:50,012 --> 00:40:53,515
then sends them right back
out there to bring him
a whole lot of money.

729
00:40:53,598 --> 00:40:57,852

I made him out to be a pimp.

You telling me
a nigga in America,

771
00:42:56,086 --> 00:42:58,254
with that much money...
Why not? You're ignorant.

772
00:42:58,338 --> 00:43:01,966
Oh yeah? You're just
telling it like it is,
just like Petey Greene.

773
00:43:02,049 --> 00:43:05,136
No, I'm telling you.
Why you think they snatched
him off the air so fast

774
00:43:05,219 --> 00:43:08,389
if he wasn't telling
the truth?
C-O-N-spiracy.

775
00:43:08,847 --> 00:43:10,057
See, you're right
about the con part.

776
00:43:10,098 --> 00:43:11,725
That's why they took
his black ass off the air.

777
00:43:11,808 --> 00:43:13,560
Berry Gordy is
a stand-up brother.

778
00:43:13,643 --> 00:43:17,647
Don't nobody want to hear
some con talking mess about
somebody like Berry Gordy.

779
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:18,773
Right.
Come on.

780
00:43:18,856 --> 00:43:23,027
I would rather listen
to a con than this
sucker-for-love-ass nigga.

781
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:25,154
Petey Greene was cool,
but that white boy
that was with him...

Yeah.

Guys, drinks are on me, okay?

See that, now,
I could get with that.

787
00:43:38,291 --> 00:43:40,793
Thank you, my brother.
Thank you, my brother.

788
00:43:40,835 --> 00:43:42,837
Yo, bartender.
Thank you.

789
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,380
Right on.
How much you leaving, man?

Hey, hey. Keep it coming.
Right on, Kevin.

the world, radio man?

Let me ask you something, man.

794
00:44:15,075 --> 00:44:16,493
Why, huh?

795
00:44:18,203 --> 00:44:21,164
Why should I put my ass
on the line for you?

796
00:44:23,249 --> 00:44:27,086
Why should I give up
all this right here

and take a chance on you?

798

I guess I need you

to say the things
I'm afraid to say.

do the things
you're afraid to do.

802

Yeah. It was good, man.

in the men's room.

I'm telling it.

gonna keep on telling it.

Hold it. You can't give
this thug a job.

921
00:50:53,607 --> 00:50:55,191
Man, I got your thug
right here. Ten inches.

922
00:50:55,275 --> 00:50:56,818
Oh, for heaven's sake.
Be cool, Jim.

923
00:50:56,901 --> 00:50:59,696
What?
We'll talk. We'll talk, okay?

924
00:50:59,779 --> 00:51:02,698
I want him on a short leash.
A very short leash.

925
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:04,700
And I want a morals clause
in your contract.

926
00:51:04,784 --> 00:51:06,285
Fine, man, whatever.
I'll sign it.

927
00:51:06,368 --> 00:51:08,370
Just let me get back
to work, okay?
Jim, wait up.

928
00:51:08,454 --> 00:51:10,247
Can I get back to work?

929
00:51:10,330 --> 00:51:12,374
All right. But you watch
your language.
All right!

930
00:51:12,457 --> 00:51:15,418
And you keep an eye on him.
Thank you, sir.

931
00:51:16,169 --> 00:51:18,421
All right,
let's get busy here.

932
00:51:18,504 --> 00:51:20,548
(MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING)

933
00:51:25,886 --> 00:51:27,721
I love that song!

934
00:51:27,763 --> 00:51:30,057
Reminds me of summertime
on the beach

935
00:51:30,098 --> 00:51:33,059
trying to get some foxy coed
to rub some lotion on me.

936
00:51:33,101 --> 00:51:34,436
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.

937
00:51:34,894 --> 00:51:37,647
Well, in case you been
asleep at the wheel,
this is Petey Greene.

938
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:38,731
Hello, caller,
what's your name?

939
00:51:38,815 --> 00:51:40,733
And you ain't in Washington,
DC no more, Dorothy.

940
00:51:40,775 --> 00:51:42,068
No, this is P-Town.
All right, Tom, please hold.

941
00:51:42,109 --> 00:51:43,778
Hello, caller,
what's your name?
WOL-AM.

942
00:51:43,861 --> 00:51:44,403
Hello, James.

943
00:51:44,945 --> 00:51:46,697
(FUNK MUSIC PLAYING)

944
00:52:10,969 --> 00:52:13,305
My granny,
I call her Aunt Pig,

945
00:52:13,388 --> 00:52:17,142
Aunt Pig say, "Petey,
why you always in jail?"

946
00:52:17,725 --> 00:52:20,770
I tell her I don't know.
"I don't know, Aunt Pig."

947
00:52:20,853 --> 00:52:23,814
Then one day
I read my indictment papers,

948
00:52:23,856 --> 00:52:29,194
they say,
"Ralph Waldo Greene versus
the United States of America. "

949
00:52:29,278 --> 00:52:32,155
I said, "Damn! No wonder
I ain't been winning!"

950
00:52:32,197 --> 00:52:33,448
He's talking about...

951
00:52:33,490 --> 00:52:37,035
And I don't care
what nobody say, ain't nothing
like a black woman.

952
00:52:37,118 --> 00:52:39,787
Now, that ain't to say
I ain't dabbled before.

953
00:52:39,871 --> 00:52:43,082
I mean, I dabbled, man,
I'm a good old dabbler.

954
00:52:43,332 --> 00:52:48,295
But give me a sister
with big hips,
big legs and a big old 'fro,

955
00:52:48,379 --> 00:52:51,340
and you ain't got to worry
about me no more.

956
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:56,052
NIGHTHAWK: Hey, hey, hey!
Fan mail.

957
00:52:56,678 --> 00:52:58,555
How many for The Hawk?

958
00:53:00,681 --> 00:53:02,016
Three?

959
00:53:02,058 --> 00:53:03,351
Sorry.

960
00:53:04,727 --> 00:53:06,770
Gave you one of Petey's.

961
00:53:08,689 --> 00:53:10,816
Y'all listen everyday, huh?

962
00:53:13,652 --> 00:53:14,653
Ain't you, now!

963
00:53:14,694 --> 00:53:16,029
Check it out.
Yeah.

964
00:53:25,371 --> 00:53:27,414
Talk to me, Petey! Talk to me!

965
00:53:27,665 --> 00:53:30,375
Talk to me!
Want me to talk to you?
I'll talk to you.

966
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:32,586
(SCREAMS)

967
00:53:32,669 --> 00:53:34,170
God damn it!

968
00:53:36,714 --> 00:53:38,132
Oh, baby.

969
00:53:38,216 --> 00:53:39,884
Let me explain.
I'm listening.

970
00:53:39,926 --> 00:53:41,135
Girl, put the bottle down

971
00:53:41,219 --> 00:53:43,512
and let me talk to you.
Go on, Petey. I'm listening.

972
00:53:43,596 --> 00:53:47,349
"Talk to me, Petey.
Talk to me, baby."
Ain't what the bitch said?

973
00:53:47,433 --> 00:53:52,229
You tell this bitch how I was
the only one to give your
sorry ass a place to stay

974
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:54,564
when you had nowhere else
to go. Tell this bitch!

975
00:53:54,606 --> 00:53:55,774
She took me in.

976
00:53:55,857 --> 00:53:58,901
I cleaned your clothes,
and I cooked your food,

977
00:53:58,943 --> 00:54:00,653
motherfucker!
Oh, shit. Okay! Okay!

978
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:03,114
Vernell, please. Baby,
listen, now. Don't do this.

979
00:54:03,197 --> 00:54:05,116
You don't wanna
do this here. Hold on.

980
00:54:05,199 --> 00:54:07,701
Listen, I'm sorry.

981
00:54:07,785 --> 00:54:09,077
I fucked up.
Yeah, you fucked up.

982
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:12,664
I did. I fucked up.
I know it, baby. I know it.

983
00:54:12,748 --> 00:54:16,209
And I ain't trying to make
no excuses for it. But you
don't wanna do this here.

984
00:54:16,292 --> 00:54:19,504
Vernell. Come on, baby,
put the bottle down.

985
00:54:20,963 --> 00:54:22,298
(SOBBING)

986
00:54:22,715 --> 00:54:23,966
Get out.

987
00:54:27,136 --> 00:54:29,638
Nigga, didn't you hear?
I said get out!
This is my joint.

988
00:54:29,721 --> 00:54:31,556
I don't give a fuck, Petey!
Get out!

989
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:33,433
Let me put some drawers
on or something.
Get the fuck out!

990
00:54:33,475 --> 00:54:35,852
Don't make me say it again,
nigga. I swear to God,

991
00:54:35,935 --> 00:54:39,188
I don't wanna get more upset
than I already am
with this bottle

992
00:54:39,272 --> 00:54:40,773
and get jumpy
and cut your dick off.

993
00:54:40,815 --> 00:54:44,110
You'll be sounding like
Frankie Lyman on the radio.
Get the fuck out!

994
00:54:44,151 --> 00:54:45,319
All right.

995
00:54:45,402 --> 00:54:47,321
Get out.
I'm leaving.

996
00:54:50,407 --> 00:54:52,659
Vernell! Baby...

997
00:54:52,701 --> 00:54:53,869
(KNOCKING)

998
00:54:54,369 --> 00:54:57,455
Help a nigga out, now.
Come on.

999
00:54:57,497 --> 00:54:58,831
Come on, man.
You gotta be shitting me.

1000
00:54:58,873 --> 00:55:00,666
Look at me, man!
I don't want to look at you!

1001
00:55:00,708 --> 00:55:03,169
I wanna get this image
out of my head.
Dewey, Dewey, Dewey, listen.

1002
00:55:03,252 --> 00:55:06,255
Now, Vernell kicked me out
the house. Caught me fucking
some other broad, man.

1003
00:55:06,338 --> 00:55:07,298
I ain't got
nowhere else to go.

1004
00:55:07,381 --> 00:55:09,925
You should have thought
about that before you let
your snake out the cage.

1005
00:55:10,008 --> 00:55:11,468
Listen, man,
my snake's been incarcerated!

1006
00:55:11,551 --> 00:55:15,055
I've been jacking off
to girlie magazines
for nine damn years.

1007
00:55:15,138 --> 00:55:17,640
Come on, you telling me
you gonna pass up
some fine-ass woman

1008
00:55:17,724 --> 00:55:19,183
just throw her pussy
all up on your face?

1009
00:55:19,225 --> 00:55:20,435
Hey, Dave.

1010
00:55:20,518 --> 00:55:22,270
Hey, Dave!
Get in here. Come on.

1011
00:55:22,353 --> 00:55:24,021
Just helping out...

1012
00:55:25,397 --> 00:55:27,399
My motherfucking deuce!

1013
00:55:30,235 --> 00:55:34,364
Susan, this is Petey Greene.
His girlfriend kicked him out,
so we gotta...

1014
00:55:34,406 --> 00:55:35,907
I'll leave you two alone.
No, no, no, no, baby.

1015
00:55:35,949 --> 00:55:38,409
No, no, there's no need
for that. You... Just...

1016
00:55:38,743 --> 00:55:40,995
Is this what you mean
by taking your work home
with you?

1017
00:55:41,078 --> 00:55:42,955
Being married to your career?
Listen, listen...

1018
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:45,207
I should have known.
Come on, help me out here.

1019
00:55:45,291 --> 00:55:47,334
No, no, no, no, no... Hey!

1020
00:55:50,254 --> 00:55:51,254
Damn!

1021
00:55:52,422 --> 00:55:55,842
Man, ain't that a bitch?
Women, man. I'm telling you.

1022
00:55:56,634 --> 00:56:01,389
PETEY: (SINGING)
I've been loving you...

1023
00:56:03,724 --> 00:56:06,769
too long, Vernell

1024
00:56:07,603 --> 00:56:10,647
to stop now

1025
00:56:16,444 --> 00:56:18,780
You are...

1026
00:56:20,615 --> 00:56:22,158
(WHISPERING)
Shut the hell up, man.

1027
00:56:22,533 --> 00:56:23,534
Put that on!

1028
00:56:26,203 --> 00:56:27,996
I'm sorry, Dewey.

1029
00:56:33,793 --> 00:56:35,587
I fucked up, man.

1030
00:56:35,628 --> 00:56:36,921
Oh, shit.

1031
00:56:38,131 --> 00:56:40,008
I fucked up, didn't I?

1032
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:47,097
Shit. Just...

1033
00:56:48,515 --> 00:56:54,187
Just give her a chance
to cool off, man,
and then you'll talk, okay?

1034
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:57,273
(SOBBING) She don't wanna
talk to me. She mad at me.

1035
00:56:57,357 --> 00:57:01,986
She loves you.
She loves you, okay?

1036
00:57:02,028 --> 00:57:03,529
Yeah.
Okay?

1037
00:57:03,571 --> 00:57:05,489
Yeah. Yeah.

1038
00:57:07,199 --> 00:57:09,034
You're a good friend, Dewey.

1039
00:57:09,118 --> 00:57:10,702
Okay.

1040
00:57:10,786 --> 00:57:13,663
You're a good friend. Yeah.
Yeah, it's... Okay, man.

1041
00:57:13,705 --> 00:57:16,082
Thank you, man.
Okay! Okay! Okay. Come on.

1042
00:57:16,166 --> 00:57:17,417
Okay.

1043
00:57:22,463 --> 00:57:24,048
Get some sleep.

1044
00:57:26,550 --> 00:57:27,718
Get some sleep.

1045
00:57:29,887 --> 00:57:32,180
I'll talk to you
in the morning, Dewey.
Tomorrow.

1046
00:57:32,264 --> 00:57:34,266
Okay.
In the morning, man.

1047
00:57:34,349 --> 00:57:35,892
Crazy little...

1048
00:57:38,853 --> 00:57:39,854
(CLATTERING)

1049
00:57:39,937 --> 00:57:41,105
Shit.

1050
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,651
Oh, man.

1051
00:57:50,405 --> 00:57:53,700
I appreciate, you know,
you letting me stay at
your place again, bro, but...

1052
00:57:53,742 --> 00:57:54,909
Come on, man.
Good night, sir.

1053
00:57:54,993 --> 00:57:56,327
Gonna have to give me
some more threads. I can't...

1054
00:57:56,411 --> 00:57:58,371
I'm not giving you
any more of my clothes.

1055
00:57:58,454 --> 00:57:59,539
Man...

1056
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:01,791
Good night, Mike.
Good night.

1057
00:58:02,083 --> 00:58:03,042
Good night, Jim.
Good night.

1058
00:58:03,125 --> 00:58:04,919
"Night, Jim.

1059
00:58:05,002 --> 00:58:06,212
"Have a nice weekend."

1060
00:58:06,295 --> 00:58:07,713
I don't talk like that.

1061
00:58:07,755 --> 00:58:09,590
Yeah, you talk
exactly like that.

1062
00:58:09,631 --> 00:58:12,384
And you walk like
you got a stick broke off
in your ass, man.

1063
00:58:12,426 --> 00:58:14,219
I walk with confidence,
like Johnny Carson.

1064
00:58:14,261 --> 00:58:17,430
You could learn something
from him. Good night...

1065
00:58:18,097 --> 00:58:20,141
Those are my gators, man.

1066
00:58:25,354 --> 00:58:26,772
This all my...

1067
00:58:32,402 --> 00:58:34,112
Is she still here?

1068
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:50,460
Now we're even.

1069
00:58:56,716 --> 00:58:58,760
Oh, no, she didn't.
Hold on. Hold on.

1070
00:58:58,843 --> 00:59:00,845
No, she...
You don't understand.
Calm down, Petey.

REPORTER. :... in Washington,
faced with angry, disgruntled
citizens of the United States,

1228
01:15:10,958 --> 01:15:13,753
while the flag flew
at half-mast
for Martin Luther King.

1229
01:15:13,794 --> 01:15:16,213
Amid the chaos today,
two local radio broadcasters,

1230
01:15:16,297 --> 01:15:20,425
Dewey Hughes and Petey Greene
are being credited
with restoring calm

1231
01:15:20,509 --> 01:15:22,761
to the nation's capital.

1232
01:15:23,136 --> 01:15:27,223
PETEY ON LOUDSPEAKER. : Now,
DC is Chocolate City,
y'all know that's right.

1233
01:15:27,307 --> 01:15:30,768
Now they wanna keep us down,
'cause they afraid
of what's gonna happen

1234
01:15:30,852 --> 01:15:32,895
if we stand up.

1235
01:15:32,978 --> 01:15:35,773
Why do you think
they send our boys off to war

1236
01:15:35,814 --> 01:15:39,318
instead of keeping them
in school,
where they can learn to score?

1237
01:15:39,401 --> 01:15:40,527
Yeah!
Yeah!

1238
01:15:40,610 --> 01:15:43,488
Because the white folk know
that if we stand tall,

1239
01:15:43,572 --> 01:15:47,367
oh, buddy, we gonna
have something called
Black Power, y'all!

1240
01:15:48,409 --> 01:15:52,663
Right? All of y'all
look beautiful today.

1241
01:15:53,330 --> 01:15:56,542
Psychologist asked me
what I thought about
the word "nigger." I said...

1242
01:15:56,625 --> 01:16:01,379
Lady, "nigger" is the greatest
stress reliever ever invented.

1243
01:16:01,463 --> 01:16:05,383
See, white man say "nigger,"
he ready for a six-month
hibernation, am I right?

1244
01:16:05,467 --> 01:16:06,634
But, see, a black man,

1245
01:16:06,718 --> 01:16:11,180
he could say "honkey," "ofay,"
"cracker," "peckerwood"

1246
01:16:11,264 --> 01:16:12,390
a million times,

1247
01:16:12,473 --> 01:16:14,475
still wanna go out there
and kill somebody.

1248
01:16:15,017 --> 01:16:19,062
You're gonna to have
to tone it down, Petey. I've
got the FCC all over my rear.

1249
01:16:19,146 --> 01:16:22,858
Well, with all due respect,
sir, the FCC can kiss my ass.

1250
01:16:22,941 --> 01:16:24,818
I ain't saying nothing
but the truth.

1251
01:16:24,901 --> 01:16:26,110
As long as the people
wanna hear it,

1252
01:16:26,194 --> 01:16:27,362
I'm gonna keep telling it.

1253
01:16:27,403 --> 01:16:29,113
I'm gonna talk it
on the radio,

1254
01:16:29,197 --> 01:16:30,781
and I'm gonna talk it
on the streets.

1255
01:16:30,865 --> 01:16:32,450
I'm gonna talk it
to the police,

1256
01:16:32,533 --> 01:16:34,410
and even that sucker,
Tricky Dick!

1257
01:16:36,370 --> 01:16:39,873
This is P-Town, baby.
Talk to y'all tomorrow.

1258
01:16:43,585 --> 01:16:45,837
Now, that was a good one, Dew.

1259
01:16:47,463 --> 01:16:49,382
That was a great show, Petey.
Right on.

1260
01:16:49,424 --> 01:16:51,050
That was a great show.

1261
01:16:52,093 --> 01:16:54,053
Look at them.
They're still calling.

1262
01:16:54,094 --> 01:16:56,638
Oh man, what a day.
That was a hell of a day.

1263
01:16:56,722 --> 01:16:59,641
Thank you, man.
Man, you're incredible,
you know?

1264
01:16:59,725 --> 01:17:02,602
I just see the things you do,
the effect
you have on people...

1265
01:17:02,686 --> 01:17:05,063
It's amazing to me.
You got a gift.

1266
01:17:05,105 --> 01:17:08,358
You know? Something people
like me could only dream of.

1267
01:17:08,441 --> 01:17:10,109
I think you could go
all the way.

1268
01:17:10,193 --> 01:17:14,113
Let me be your manager.
Let me guide your career.

1269

Well, I don't think
the whole world is ready
for a nigga like me.

1272
01:17:24,956 --> 01:17:26,958
Well I think you're wrong.

1273
01:17:27,709 --> 01:17:30,086
I think the world's
been waiting

1274
01:17:30,711 --> 01:17:32,630
for a nigga like you.

1275
01:17:32,672 --> 01:17:34,131
What you say?

01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:37,634

ever been to vote?
How you doing, young brother?

1280
01:17:54,859 --> 01:17:59,279
Okay, vote for Shirley

Are you registered?

"why you rob everybody
in the house?"

Y'all see the paper
this morning, P-Town?

get invited by the President
to the White House,

Petey Greene. This is
Petey Greene's Washington. "

No, I didn't.
Yeah, you did.

That's some stupid shit.

1369

How many times
have we been doing this show?

1370
01:23:20,782 --> 01:23:22,784
I'm gonna say some stupid
shit like that? Come on, man.

1371
01:23:22,868 --> 01:23:24,828
Okay, my mistake.
I didn't say,
"Good evening, Petey."

1372
01:23:24,911 --> 01:23:28,081

Okay, let's try it again.

Born so.

Let's try it again.
See what you did?

1377

Yep.

Maybe.

You're not gonna
believe it, man.

Glad you could make it
on such short notice.

1411

to be here, Dewey.
I can see it in his eyes.

1469
01:29:59,856 --> 01:30:03,235
Just keep an eye on him.

1470

01:48:59,318 --> 01:49:01,653
So I'm gonna give you
one last shot.

1671
01:49:10,161 --> 01:49:11,579
That's deep.

1672
01:49:11,662 --> 01:49:12,997
(CHUCKLES)

1673
01:49:14,039 --> 01:49:16,000
Yeah it was, wasn't it?

1674
01:49:18,293 --> 01:49:20,087
I might put that
in a card someday.

1675
01:49:20,170 --> 01:49:21,796
(PETEY CHUCKLES)

1676
01:49:25,175 --> 01:49:27,093
(POOL BALLS STRIKING)

1677
01:49:28,261 --> 01:49:29,929
Good shot, Petey.

1678
01:49:42,232 --> 01:49:43,108
(CHATTERING)

1679
01:49:48,196 --> 01:49:51,407
Everybody come back
to the shop
with their eyes fucked up...

1680
01:49:52,908 --> 01:49:54,201
Stop it!

1681
01:49:56,203 --> 01:49:57,579
(INAUDIBLE)

1682
01:50:04,544 --> 01:50:09,841
PETEY. : I ain't nothing, man,
I ain't nothing
but a con and a thief.

1683
01:50:09,924 --> 01:50:12,468
So I ain't up here trying
to be nobody's preacher.

1684
01:50:12,551 --> 01:50:16,722
I'm just trying to tell
the truth to y'all,
like I promised I would.

1685
01:50:22,978 --> 01:50:27,065
DEWEY. : Petey liked to say
that he was just a con.

1686
01:50:27,440 --> 01:50:29,567
Telling it like it is.

1687
01:50:31,277 --> 01:50:33,320
But he was more than that.

1688
01:50:38,617 --> 01:50:41,495
He said the things
that we were afraid to say.

1689
01:50:43,580 --> 01:50:45,081
I'm sorry, man.

1690
01:50:52,797 --> 01:50:55,549
He was the bravest man
that I ever met.

1691
01:50:57,926 --> 01:51:00,637
He was, and still is,
everything I'm not.

1692
01:51:04,015 --> 01:51:05,642
And that's why I love him.

1693
01:51:05,725 --> 01:51:07,185
MAN: Yeah.

1694
01:51:11,314 --> 01:51:13,732
So, in the words
of my best friend,

1695
01:51:16,985 --> 01:51:19,279
"That's all we got.
MAN: Yeah!

1696
01:51:19,363 --> 01:51:21,156
"There ain't no more.
That's right!

1697
01:51:21,239 --> 01:51:23,116
"Time is tight.

1698
01:51:23,199 --> 01:51:25,702
"It's the end of the show.

1699
01:51:25,785 --> 01:51:29,664
"So grab your head
and make a fist. "

1700
01:51:30,248 --> 01:51:32,958
"Listen to me
and remember this. "

1701
01:51:33,042 --> 01:51:34,335
...and remember this.

1702
01:51:34,418 --> 01:51:37,713
I tell it to the hot,
I tell it to the cold.

1703
01:51:37,796 --> 01:51:41,341
I tell it to the young,
I tell it to the old.

1704
01:51:41,424 --> 01:51:44,219
Don't want no laughing,
don't want no crying.

1705
01:51:44,302 --> 01:51:47,263
And most of all,
no signifying.
DEWEY. : "...no signifying!"

1706
01:51:47,847 --> 01:51:51,726
This is
Petey Greene's Washington,
ladies and gentlemen.

1707
01:51:51,767 --> 01:51:53,310
This is P-Town!

1708
01:51:53,394 --> 01:51:56,772
ALL: Petey! Petey!
Petey! Petey!

1709
01:51:56,855 --> 01:52:00,567
Petey! Petey! Petey! Petey!

1710
01:52:06,739 --> 01:52:07,865
PETEY. : Be cool, y'all.

1711
01:52:55,868 --> 01:52:57,703
PETEY. : Wake up, God damn it!

1712
01:54:17,734 --> 01:54:19,653
VERNELL. : Shirley Chisholm
for President, everybody!

1713
01:54:19,736 --> 01:54:22,197
Vote Shirley Chisholm
for President, 1972!

1714
01:56:15,259 --> 01:56:18,303
PETEY. : Why do you think
they send our boys off to war?

1715
01:58:28,548 --> 01:58:32,093
Look here. I ain't never
asked for this shit.
