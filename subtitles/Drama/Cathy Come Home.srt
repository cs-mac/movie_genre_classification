1
00:00:01,521 --> 00:00:02,317
(Traffic noise)

2
00:00:02,401 --> 00:00:05,313
# If you miss the train I'm on

3
00:00:05,801 --> 00:00:09,794
# Then you'll know that I am gone

4
00:00:10,561 --> 00:00:14,474
# You can hear the whistle blow

5
00:00:14,561 --> 00:00:17,951
# Five hundred miles

6
00:00:19,321 --> 00:00:21,755
# Five hundred miles

7
00:00:21,881 --> 00:00:24,190
# Five hundred miles

8
00:00:24,321 --> 00:00:26,437
# Five hundred miles

9
00:00:26,561 --> 00:00:28,597
# Five hundred miles

10
00:00:29,281 --> 00:00:32,830
# You can hear the whistle blow

11
00:00:33,441 --> 00:00:36,433
# Five hundred miles

12
00:00:39,521 --> 00:00:41,477
(Girl) Well, I was a bit fed up,
you know.

13
00:00:41,561 --> 00:00:43,119
There didn't seem to be
much there for me.

14
00:00:43,201 --> 00:00:47,797
You know these little towns.:
one coffee bar, closed on a Sunday.

15
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,712
Didn't even tell 'em I was going.

16
00:00:49,801 --> 00:00:53,476
I sent 'em a card
when I got down there.

17
00:00:53,561 --> 00:00:56,712
That house over there,
that one with the broken steps.

18
00:00:56,801 --> 00:01:00,396
That's where I went for a room
and the fella kept touching me.

19
00:01:00,481 --> 00:01:02,597
Where did I get a room in the end?

20
00:01:02,681 --> 00:01:05,115
Oh, yeah, down there,

21
00:01:05,201 --> 00:01:07,556
Mantua Street,?3 a week.

22
00:01:07,641 --> 00:01:10,951
That's where I got my first job.
Petrol-pump girl, mad.

23
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:14,636
They were going along in these
hearses to an "unusual supper party"

24
00:01:14,721 --> 00:01:18,634
and the bloke ahead of 'em,
the chandelier falls down on him

25
00:01:18,721 --> 00:01:20,916
and he gets strangled
with all these diamonds.

26
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:23,561
Then this woman who'd grown
to about 40 foot high...

27
00:01:23,641 --> 00:01:26,599
- Through the radioactive dust?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

28
00:01:26,681 --> 00:01:28,637
.. sticks her hand through this window

29
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:32,396
and gets hold of this mean little
piece he'd been jitterbugging with...

30
00:01:32,481 --> 00:01:34,711
- It was an old film?
- Yes, quite old.

31
00:01:34,801 --> 00:01:37,759
But unbeknownst
to this big 40-foot girl,

32
00:01:37,841 --> 00:01:41,516
there's been a bit of swapping round,
and it's not her husband any more.

33
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:44,240
Anyway, as he's jumping up,
his mask slips.

34
00:01:44,321 --> 00:01:47,358
- Who d’ you think it was?
- Duke of Edinburgh?

35
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:49,477
# If the sky

36
00:01:49,561 --> 00:01:51,711
# That we look upon

37
00:01:52,721 --> 00:01:55,155
# Should tumble and fall

38
00:01:55,521 --> 00:01:57,477
# Or the mountain

39
00:01:58,041 --> 00:02:01,272
# Should crumble to the sea

40
00:02:03,881 --> 00:02:07,400
# I won't cry

41
00:02:07,481 --> 00:02:11,474
# No, I won't shed a tear

42
00:02:12,081 --> 00:02:13,878
# Just as long

43
00:02:13,961 --> 00:02:15,394
# As you stand

44
00:02:16,121 --> 00:02:18,157
# Stand by me

45
00:02:18,561 --> 00:02:20,756
# And darling, darling

46
00:02:21,001 --> 00:02:23,469
# Stand by me

47
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:27,833
# Oh, stand by me

48
00:02:27,921 --> 00:02:30,151
# Whoa, stand now

49
00:02:31,241 --> 00:02:33,277
# Stand by me... #

50
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:36,558
- We'll have a motor, an E-type, eh?
- Help me down, then.

51
00:02:36,641 --> 00:02:38,597
How about an E-type, eh, Cath?

52
00:02:39,361 --> 00:02:43,593
- An E-type? They're expensive.
- No, we'll have an E-type.

53
00:02:43,681 --> 00:02:45,672
I mean, why not,
the money I'm earning?

54
00:02:45,761 --> 00:02:47,717
Then what d’ you think we'll do, eh?

55
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:52,397
- I don't know. Shunt it, I suppose.
- No, I'm an A1 driver, I am.

56
00:02:52,481 --> 00:02:56,235
No, we'll take the brakes out,
that's what we'll do.

57
00:02:56,321 --> 00:02:58,039
Take the brakes out?

58
00:02:58,121 --> 00:03:02,319
Yeah, this fitter down at the Lotus
told me you just don't need brakes.

59
00:03:02,401 --> 00:03:05,074
Drive it on the gears,
gears'll stop ya.

60
00:03:05,161 --> 00:03:07,391
Brakes spoil a good driver,

61
00:03:07,481 --> 00:03:10,359
and if you haven't got 'em
you're not tempted to use 'em.

62
00:03:10,441 --> 00:03:13,877
Well, I feel as if I've got
a few drinks inside me, Cath.

63
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:17,920
You know, when you've had
a few drinks you don't see nobody.

64
00:03:18,001 --> 00:03:20,561
- Wanna sit down?
- You mean you're a bit drunk?

65
00:03:20,641 --> 00:03:25,112
No, I just don't notice anybody else
when I'm out with you, Cath.

66
00:03:25,201 --> 00:03:26,600
Ah...

67
00:03:27,481 --> 00:03:30,473
Is that nice? How do you feel?

68
00:03:30,561 --> 00:03:33,519
- I'm not telling you.
- Oh, go on, I told you.

69
00:03:33,601 --> 00:03:34,920
No!

70
00:03:35,001 --> 00:03:37,469
- You can tell me.
- I feel embarrassed.

71
00:03:37,561 --> 00:03:40,997
There's only me here,
and that old fella's asleep.

72
00:03:42,241 --> 00:03:45,119
- That's a horrible thing to say!
- Let's go and have a drink.

73
00:03:45,201 --> 00:03:48,830
- I never knew you swore.
- It just came out, that's all.

74
00:03:48,921 --> 00:03:52,197
- Nice boys don't say those things.
- Well, I was upset.

75
00:03:52,281 --> 00:03:54,556
- Get your hand off me.
- I was just upset, that's all.

76
00:03:54,641 --> 00:03:58,031
- I think I'm going home.
- No, don't be silly.

77
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:02,397
Let's go and have a drink.

78
00:04:02,481 --> 00:04:05,712
I put my best suit on
to come out with you tonight.

79
00:04:05,801 --> 00:04:07,792
I'm sorry, I can't help it.

80
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:09,997
The least you could have done was...

81
00:04:10,081 --> 00:04:12,515
- # Whoa, do you love me?
- # Do you love me?

82
00:04:12,601 --> 00:04:15,354
- # Well, do you love me?
- # Do you love me?

83
00:04:15,441 --> 00:04:18,478
- # Yeah, do you love me?
- # Do you love me? #

84
00:04:18,561 --> 00:04:21,553
That's the advantage
working for a small firm like this.

85
00:04:21,641 --> 00:04:23,597
Just ain't particular, you know.

86
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:25,637
They don't mind about the hours,

87
00:04:25,721 --> 00:04:29,077
whether you flog yourself to death
or take it easy, they don't care.

88
00:04:29,161 --> 00:04:31,117
If you give a bird a lift...

89
00:04:31,201 --> 00:04:34,034
- I've laddered my stocking.
- I'll get you a new pair next week.

90
00:04:34,121 --> 00:04:36,112
Same with birds,
they just don't care.

91
00:04:36,201 --> 00:04:39,159
- So I'm not the first, then?
- Don't be silly.

92
00:04:39,241 --> 00:04:41,994
- Reg, what is this place?
- The firm I work for.

93
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:44,037
- Is it safe?
- Course it is.

94
00:04:44,121 --> 00:04:46,237
I bet you bought other birds up here.

95
00:04:46,321 --> 00:04:50,155
You can see a bit already.
You can see half the town from here.

96
00:04:50,241 --> 00:04:52,232
Reg, I don't like it, it's shaking.

97
00:04:52,321 --> 00:04:54,516
- Come on, get your sea legs.
- I'm scared.

98
00:04:54,601 --> 00:04:57,513
- No, I'm not coming.
- Come on!

99
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:00,679
- Come on... Whoa!
- (Shrieks)

100
00:05:00,761 --> 00:05:03,195
- Trust you!
- Up you get, careful!

101
00:05:03,281 --> 00:05:05,237
Come on.

102
00:05:05,721 --> 00:05:07,757
There.

103
00:05:08,721 --> 00:05:11,713
Trust you to bring me up
to a rotten old place like this.

104
00:05:11,801 --> 00:05:15,077
- How will we get down?
- Live in the present, eh, Cath?

105
00:05:15,161 --> 00:05:18,790
It's rotten, innit? This whole place
is gonna come down soon.

106
00:05:21,761 --> 00:05:24,673
- I was scared, Reg.
- Ah, don't be silly.

107
00:05:24,761 --> 00:05:28,515
No, I was, really.
I haven't got much courage.

108
00:05:28,601 --> 00:05:30,910
I reckon it's just us, now, innit?

109
00:05:31,001 --> 00:05:33,515
Just us. Just you and me, eh?

110
00:05:33,601 --> 00:05:35,637
I wouldn't mind.

111
00:05:36,921 --> 00:05:38,877
Have some babies, Cath?

112
00:05:38,961 --> 00:05:40,679
I'd like that, Reg.

113
00:05:40,761 --> 00:05:42,991
- Sod to all the rest.
- Yeah.

114
00:05:43,081 --> 00:05:45,037
(Loud chatter)

115
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:49,919
Along comes this sanitary man,
a health doodah, you see.

116
00:05:50,001 --> 00:05:53,073
You all right, darling?
You don't look at all well.

117
00:05:53,161 --> 00:05:56,039
Anyway... She's terrible!

118
00:05:56,121 --> 00:05:59,318
He perceives that these beetles
are nesting

119
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:02,393
in this clapped-out tree
at the back of May's caff.

120
00:06:02,481 --> 00:06:04,437
So he sprays disinfectant
in the tree.

121
00:06:04,521 --> 00:06:07,638
Some gets in May's dinner
and kills two customers.

122
00:06:07,721 --> 00:06:08,915
Someone's got to eat.

123
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:10,957
What about Coming To The End Of Love?

124
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:14,670
- How does that one go?
- # Coming to the end of love... #

125
00:06:14,761 --> 00:06:17,480
I wrote that an' all,
never got no credit.

126
00:06:17,561 --> 00:06:19,756
Did you like living in the country?

127
00:06:19,841 --> 00:06:22,514
No, there was nothing there for me...

128
00:06:22,601 --> 00:06:25,161
(Screams) Reg, please!

129
00:06:26,681 --> 00:06:29,639
I found one of them little beetles
down her back!

130
00:06:29,721 --> 00:06:33,396
- And a history of incontinence?
- Oh, yes, there's that.

131
00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:38,752
Rambling in his mind,
finding it hard to remember things?

132
00:06:38,841 --> 00:06:40,877
A little, aren't you, Grandad?

133
00:06:40,961 --> 00:06:43,634
- I don't know, I've never been...
- No, thank you.

134
00:06:43,721 --> 00:06:46,155
And has to be helped with dressing?

135
00:06:46,241 --> 00:06:49,438
Yes, well, I certainly think
you've got a case

136
00:06:49,521 --> 00:06:51,955
for having your father
taken into care.

137
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:54,316
What would you feel about it,
Grandad?

138
00:06:54,401 --> 00:06:58,553
- I'm not in agreement with it.
- Besides, we need the space.

139
00:06:58,641 --> 00:07:02,839
The two boys are coming back
out the Army so we can't keep him.

140
00:07:02,921 --> 00:07:07,278
- The council say it's overcrowding.
- Yes, yes, of course.

141
00:07:07,361 --> 00:07:10,751
And the incontinence
is getting pretty bad.

142
00:07:10,841 --> 00:07:14,629
Well, Grandad, you'll be
in one of our larger homes.

143
00:07:14,721 --> 00:07:18,396
Rivermeade, I expect you've
noticed it up at Town Hall.

144
00:07:19,161 --> 00:07:22,119
It's especially suitable for you

145
00:07:22,201 --> 00:07:26,592
because they have many facilities
you mightn't get in a smaller place,

146
00:07:26,681 --> 00:07:30,560
and as well as that,
there's always plenty to do.

147
00:07:30,641 --> 00:07:33,758
Plenty to keep the time passing,

148
00:07:33,841 --> 00:07:37,516
what with dances
and hobby clubs of various kinds,

149
00:07:37,601 --> 00:07:41,833
and help is available for things
that might be getting complicated

150
00:07:41,921 --> 00:07:45,072
like dressing
and attention to your feet.

151
00:07:45,161 --> 00:07:47,152
Come here!

152
00:07:47,241 --> 00:07:49,311
Cathy? Come on, Cathy.

153
00:07:49,401 --> 00:07:51,119
Cathy!

154
00:07:51,201 --> 00:07:53,590
Cathy, I just want to...

155
00:07:55,001 --> 00:07:56,957
(Shrieking and laughing)

156
00:07:58,361 --> 00:08:00,591
Now get out of that!

157
00:08:03,401 --> 00:08:05,676
I just want to talk to ya!

158
00:08:06,721 --> 00:08:09,155
Hey, Reg, that's good. What is it?

159
00:08:09,241 --> 00:08:14,110
Double windows. Keeps the sounds
of the traffic out and the heat in.

160
00:08:14,201 --> 00:08:18,160
I was thinking, you know that table
we saw in the shop the other day?

161
00:08:18,241 --> 00:08:20,550
- Wouldn't it look good over there?
- Yeah.

162
00:08:20,641 --> 00:08:24,031
And I could get one of those
rubber plants to put on it.

163
00:08:24,121 --> 00:08:26,681
Where should we have the telly?

164
00:08:26,761 --> 00:08:28,991
The telly? I don't know, really.

165
00:08:29,081 --> 00:08:32,118
Yeah, I reckon that's
a nice little picture, that, Cath.

166
00:08:32,201 --> 00:08:35,193
Are we overstepping it a bit,
taking on this place?

167
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:38,432
I dunno.
Bit late now we got it, innit?

168
00:08:38,521 --> 00:08:41,911
No point taking on a posh place
if we can't afford it.

169
00:08:42,001 --> 00:08:46,756
Of course we can. I'm earning
?25 a week, then there's you.

170
00:08:46,841 --> 00:08:49,719
What is it,?6 a week
plus?3 in tips?

171
00:08:49,801 --> 00:08:52,759
That's?34,?35 a week.
Bloody millionaires, ain't we?

172
00:08:52,841 --> 00:08:54,797
We worth?35 a week?

173
00:08:54,881 --> 00:08:57,839
(Cathy) Funny, place like that
even smells different.

174
00:08:57,921 --> 00:08:59,957
Must be the central heating.

175
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:02,874
Felt different too, in your bones.

176
00:09:02,961 --> 00:09:04,917
Oh, what a place!

177
00:09:05,001 --> 00:09:08,630
Parquet flooring,
tin-openers fixed to the wall,

178
00:09:08,721 --> 00:09:10,757
double glazing...

179
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:13,230
And the neighbours,
talk about stylish!

180
00:09:13,681 --> 00:09:16,878
All right, now we're
going to try something

181
00:09:16,961 --> 00:09:20,431
which sounds complicated,
but isn't really.

182
00:09:20,521 --> 00:09:26,153
Now, put your arms down by the side
of your body, completely relaxed.

183
00:09:26,241 --> 00:09:28,516
Now, when you contract a leg,

184
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:32,116
your toe turns up,
you make a sort of square.

185
00:09:32,201 --> 00:09:35,557
(Cathy) It came as a surprise
when I found out.

186
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:38,030
I was sick all the time
and it never occurred to me why.

187
00:09:38,121 --> 00:09:41,909
So the doctor, he said.:
"Can it be that you're pregnant?"

188
00:09:42,001 --> 00:09:44,196
And then I realised.

189
00:09:44,281 --> 00:09:47,432
I got to dreaming then
about what it would be like.

190
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:51,434
Now, this is a diagram to show
what happens right at the start

191
00:09:51,521 --> 00:09:53,876
before labour really starts.

192
00:09:53,961 --> 00:09:58,193
You can see that the baby
is surrounded by fluid

193
00:09:58,281 --> 00:10:01,910
and it's quite intact,
hasn't broken it at all.

194
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:06,677
And this is the neck of the uterus,
or the cervix as we call it.

195
00:10:06,761 --> 00:10:09,594
Me and my husband are looking for
a house to buy. Could you help us?

196
00:10:09,681 --> 00:10:13,515
Well, we have a number of properties
in the lower price ranges,

197
00:10:13,601 --> 00:10:17,560
?3,500 to?5,000, if that's the
sort of thing you're interested in,

198
00:10:17,641 --> 00:10:21,714
on which we could probably arrange
a 90%%% mortgage.

199
00:10:21,801 --> 00:10:24,599
May I ask how big
your deposit would be?

200
00:10:24,681 --> 00:10:27,718
Well, I'm off work now
so we haven't got quite so much.

201
00:10:27,801 --> 00:10:31,635
But I reckon we could manage
about?100.

202
00:10:31,721 --> 00:10:34,281
?100 would barely cover
the legal costs.

203
00:10:34,361 --> 00:10:40,152
You might find a new flat with
a deposit of?400 but you'd be lucky.

204
00:10:40,241 --> 00:10:43,233
I mean, we do have cheaper houses,

205
00:10:43,321 --> 00:10:46,552
but they're in such bad condition
that a building society

206
00:10:46,641 --> 00:10:49,997
would require you to spend
about?700 on improvements.

207
00:10:50,081 --> 00:10:53,676
And they'd withhold part of the loan
until the work was complete.

208
00:10:53,761 --> 00:10:57,197
So you see,
the cheapest houses are bought

209
00:10:57,281 --> 00:11:00,273
by the people with the money
in hand to improve them.

210
00:11:00,361 --> 00:11:04,513
Oh. So really it was a waste
of my time coming here?

211
00:11:04,801 --> 00:11:06,439
(Engine grinds)

212
00:11:06,521 --> 00:11:08,716
(Tyres screech)

213
00:11:10,161 --> 00:11:12,117
(Crash)

214
00:11:15,281 --> 00:11:19,399
(Reg) I need compensation.
I told you about that camshaft.

215
00:11:19,481 --> 00:11:23,076
(Boss) Reg, I would compensate you
but I'm skint.

216
00:11:23,161 --> 00:11:25,311
I ain't had no insurance on me lorry.

217
00:11:25,401 --> 00:11:28,598
- You're making a bomb here!
- I don't want any argument.

218
00:11:28,681 --> 00:11:33,072
It's not argument. I've had
an accident and I want compensation.

219
00:11:33,161 --> 00:11:37,120
It's not up to me. I've got nothing
to compensate you with.

220
00:11:37,201 --> 00:11:39,556
How well off d'you think we'll be?

221
00:11:39,641 --> 00:11:42,519
Well, it's not so good, Cath,
won't have so much now.

222
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:44,990
Never mind, though, Reg'll fix it.

223
00:11:47,361 --> 00:11:49,192
Look, Reg.

224
00:11:49,281 --> 00:11:51,272
How much will we have?

225
00:11:51,361 --> 00:11:55,559
Well, you're not earning no more
and I'm down to sickness benefit.

226
00:11:55,641 --> 00:11:59,156
- How much is that, d'you know?
- No, but it's not very much.

227
00:11:59,241 --> 00:12:02,916
- How much we got on the HP, then?
- Nearly?5 a week.

228
00:12:03,001 --> 00:12:05,561
?5... Well, there's?10 on the flat.

229
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,950
- Nothing else?
- No.

230
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:10,316
Oh, there's the life insurance, too.

231
00:12:10,401 --> 00:12:12,073
Oh, yeah.

232
00:12:12,161 --> 00:12:15,198
- Still, we got savings, ain't we?
- Yeah,?30.

233
00:12:17,241 --> 00:12:19,277
(Sighs)

234
00:12:22,841 --> 00:12:26,197
I suppose we'd better find
somewhere cheaper to live, then.

235
00:12:26,281 --> 00:12:28,237
Suppose so.

236
00:12:28,321 --> 00:12:32,712
We'd have had to get out of here,
anyway. They don't allow children.

237
00:12:32,801 --> 00:12:36,237
- Westminster.
- Do you fancy sharing?

238
00:12:36,321 --> 00:12:39,597
- Sharing with who?
- I don't know.

239
00:12:39,681 --> 00:12:41,797
Get some nice young couple.

240
00:12:41,881 --> 00:12:44,349
- Took me a while to get used to you.
- Oh, thank you(!)

241
00:12:44,481 --> 00:12:48,030
(Man) There's 200,000 more families
in London than homes to put them.

242
00:12:48,121 --> 00:12:53,115
And there's 60,000 single persons
living without sinks or stoves.

243
00:12:53,201 --> 00:12:56,034
In seven central London boroughs,

244
00:12:56,121 --> 00:12:58,077
one in ten of all households
is overcrowded,

245
00:12:58,161 --> 00:13:01,358
with more than 1.5 people per room.

246
00:13:01,441 --> 00:13:03,796
Oh, hello, is your room
still to let?

247
00:13:03,881 --> 00:13:06,236
No, is it still in that place?

248
00:13:06,321 --> 00:13:07,310
Yes, it is.

249
00:13:07,401 --> 00:13:12,395
Well, it'll be a week tomorrow
since I told them to take it out.

250
00:13:12,481 --> 00:13:14,995
- Pardon?
- It'll be a week...

251
00:13:15,081 --> 00:13:19,677
On Thursday, I asked them to take
it out because I'd got suited.

252
00:13:19,761 --> 00:13:22,036
A few years back,
figures released by the LCC

253
00:13:22,121 --> 00:13:24,271
revealed that families
of certain sizes

254
00:13:24,361 --> 00:13:29,594
would be 350 years on the housing
list before being offered a house.

255
00:13:29,681 --> 00:13:31,672
Oh, it's a scourge here.

256
00:13:31,761 --> 00:13:35,310
The present target of 500,000 set
by government is not high enough.

257
00:13:35,401 --> 00:13:38,791
Even if it is reached, there's still
people living in slums in ten years.

258
00:13:38,881 --> 00:13:43,909
The government must realise this is
a crisis and treat it as such.

259
00:13:44,001 --> 00:13:48,472
We can't stay at Mum's.
The council said it was overcrowded.

260
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:52,998
They needn't find out, need they?
Oh, Mum'll fix it, don't worry.

261
00:13:53,081 --> 00:13:56,073
You're gonna have better eyes
than your dad, aren't you? Eh?

262
00:13:56,161 --> 00:13:58,436
Yeah, he's squinting a bit, though.

263
00:13:59,481 --> 00:14:01,437
- They all squint.
- Oh.

264
00:14:01,521 --> 00:14:04,718
(Cathy) Funny how a baby
makes a place quite different.

265
00:14:04,801 --> 00:14:06,757
And Reggie said so, too.

266
00:14:06,841 --> 00:14:08,957
Well, goodbye to freedom.

267
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:10,997
I didn't mind, though.

268
00:14:13,441 --> 00:14:15,159
(Women chatter)

269
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:19,231
(Man) This is what you call
the island of paradise.

270
00:14:19,321 --> 00:14:23,758
Kiddies here have seen rats running
around the place as big as cats.

271
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:31,037
(Dog barks)

272
00:14:32,921 --> 00:14:35,993
(Woman) Any time the children
have accidents,

273
00:14:36,081 --> 00:14:40,757
most times all the mothers come
down to see if they can help.

274
00:14:40,841 --> 00:14:44,834
(Old woman) The damned places
are so old, they want pulling down!

275
00:14:45,121 --> 00:14:47,191
(Woman) We've got plenty of company.

276
00:14:47,281 --> 00:14:50,956
I think we're reasonable people,
that we all get on together.

277
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:54,113
We have our ups and downs,
you can fight over the kids,

278
00:14:54,201 --> 00:14:58,035
but apart from that, we're lucky,
I suppose, better off than some.

279
00:14:58,121 --> 00:15:01,272
(Old woman) I don't like
half of the people in it,

280
00:15:01,361 --> 00:15:04,671
and what is more there's
none of 'em neighbourly.

281
00:15:04,761 --> 00:15:09,039
They've always got something to say
about you behind your back.

282
00:15:09,121 --> 00:15:11,954
(Woman) I had a friend
lived next door to me,

283
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:15,556
she really would have give?1,000
to move out of here.

284
00:15:15,641 --> 00:15:18,394
But now she's got
a brand-new maisonette,

285
00:15:18,481 --> 00:15:22,394
she said she'd like to come back
if she could bring her flat here.

286
00:15:22,481 --> 00:15:24,437
She likes the company here.

287
00:15:24,521 --> 00:15:27,718
Reggie's uncle Mac,
he was the adventurous type.

288
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,837
Spent a lot of time in India.

289
00:15:29,921 --> 00:15:33,630
He wanted to see foreign parts,
he never married.

290
00:15:33,721 --> 00:15:37,157
Then his uncle Tom
was in the Merchant Navy.

291
00:15:38,001 --> 00:15:40,879
Uncle Jim, he was the ne'er-do-well.

292
00:15:40,961 --> 00:15:43,350
When he got married,
I remember Grandad saying:

293
00:15:43,441 --> 00:15:47,832
"He's a nice fella but he'll never be
no good to no woman, not never. "

294
00:15:47,921 --> 00:15:49,957
(Children shout)

295
00:15:57,881 --> 00:16:00,156
(Woman) When I first came here,

296
00:16:00,241 --> 00:16:04,393
we never had none of this lot,
we never had no children in here.

297
00:16:04,481 --> 00:16:07,951
This was only for a married couple

298
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:11,238
or one on their own, no children.

299
00:16:11,321 --> 00:16:13,437
You had ladies here then.

300
00:16:13,521 --> 00:16:16,035
(Woman) There was rats
under the floorboards.

301
00:16:16,121 --> 00:16:18,635
The council came and put poison down.

302
00:16:18,721 --> 00:16:20,837
They said rats had been there,

303
00:16:20,921 --> 00:16:24,152
but they'd gone somewhere else
to annoy somebody else, like.

304
00:16:24,241 --> 00:16:26,277
(Girl) Reg, we've a new girl at work.

305
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:28,317
You knew her when you went to school.

306
00:16:28,401 --> 00:16:32,997
- Who's that, then?
- Christine Rowbottom or something.

307
00:16:33,081 --> 00:16:35,356
Oh, I know. Jenkins, weren't it?

308
00:16:35,441 --> 00:16:37,796
That's it. She's on the bra counter.

309
00:16:37,881 --> 00:16:39,837
She's well-suited to that
I'll tell you.

310
00:16:39,921 --> 00:16:41,991
(Laughs)

311
00:16:42,081 --> 00:16:44,436
What happened... wasn't it, erm...

312
00:16:44,521 --> 00:16:46,557
George, remember George?

313
00:16:46,641 --> 00:16:49,201
What, George that had the accident?

314
00:16:49,281 --> 00:16:51,272
Did he have an accident?

315
00:16:51,361 --> 00:16:53,317
Didn't you know? He had his leg off.

316
00:16:53,401 --> 00:16:55,471
Oh, dear, that's terrible.

317
00:16:55,561 --> 00:16:57,870
Very keen on sports, too, I remember.

318
00:16:57,961 --> 00:17:00,555
Lovely little runner, really was.

319
00:17:01,081 --> 00:17:04,551
He won't be able to run any more,
will he?

320
00:17:04,641 --> 00:17:06,711
I don't think it's funny, do you?

321
00:17:06,801 --> 00:17:09,554
(Woman)
It's the only tenement in Islington

322
00:17:09,641 --> 00:17:13,714
where you can sit in your toilet and
cook your breakfast at the same time.

323
00:17:13,801 --> 00:17:18,033
We've only got one bedroom,
I mean, you've got no married life.

324
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:22,717
Half your questions
and half your rows is over sex,

325
00:17:22,801 --> 00:17:25,315
cos your husbands think
that they've... you know,

326
00:17:25,401 --> 00:17:27,915
and you're always on nerves
with the children.

327
00:17:28,081 --> 00:17:31,517
It's not fair to a man,
or if you're married with children,

328
00:17:31,601 --> 00:17:33,637
I think you're entitled
to have another room.

329
00:17:33,721 --> 00:17:36,519
You can look out your door
up the other woman's passage.

330
00:17:36,601 --> 00:17:38,319
You can't do that in any new flats.

331
00:17:38,401 --> 00:17:41,757
I gave Reg some of those
frozen chips last week.

332
00:17:41,841 --> 00:17:45,959
- He didn't like them much.
- Know what I think about them?

333
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:48,680
Know what Mr Ward used to say?
Most unhealthy.

334
00:17:48,761 --> 00:17:53,039
(Woman) We make one another a cup
of tea, sit outside and have a laugh.

335
00:17:53,121 --> 00:17:56,591
(Old woman) Keep yourself to
yourself and you can't get in no row.

336
00:17:56,681 --> 00:18:00,833
Cook your dinner now, dear, then I'll
cook ours for Eileen and the boys.

337
00:18:00,921 --> 00:18:03,116
No, I'm gonna put the baby to bed.

338
00:18:03,201 --> 00:18:05,669
It don't work if we have it together.

339
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:10,116
I'll clear up after him this time.

340
00:18:10,201 --> 00:18:13,273
I think it's a bit hard the council
won't do nothing for you.

341
00:18:13,361 --> 00:18:16,512
I've done my bit,
I've brought up five children.

342
00:18:16,601 --> 00:18:19,274
(Woman) If we could pick,
none of us'd live here.

343
00:18:19,361 --> 00:18:22,353
Stop your fella putting his feet
on the furniture

344
00:18:22,441 --> 00:18:25,160
and picking up the baby
with his filthy hands.

345
00:18:25,241 --> 00:18:28,677
- He's your son!
- But you taught him dirty habits.

346
00:18:28,761 --> 00:18:33,312
Dirty habits? You don't wash your
hands before you touch the baby.

347
00:18:33,401 --> 00:18:36,757
- I was only doing it to help.
- And don't put Daz in his bottle!

348
00:18:36,841 --> 00:18:41,119
- And then there's the toilet.
- What about the sodding toilet?

349
00:18:41,201 --> 00:18:44,557
You know what I mean,
I think it's disgusting!

350
00:18:44,641 --> 00:18:47,474
- Well, of all the meanest things!
- (Baby cries)

351
00:18:47,561 --> 00:18:51,554
You got on my boy's nerves with worry
so that he ran off the road!

352
00:18:51,641 --> 00:18:54,235
- It's about time you was going.
- All right, we'll go.

353
00:18:55,281 --> 00:18:59,718
Keep your rotten old flat, it's
driving me round the bloody bend!

354
00:19:00,561 --> 00:19:02,517
(Children chatter)

355
00:19:02,601 --> 00:19:04,557
(Child) Come 'ere!

356
00:19:06,681 --> 00:19:08,717
Is that your cup of tea?

357
00:19:17,921 --> 00:19:19,912
Say "See you after dinner. "

358
00:19:20,001 --> 00:19:22,196
You're not very friendly, are you?

359
00:19:22,281 --> 00:19:25,159
(Cathy) We moved right away
from the parts we'd been living in.

360
00:19:25,241 --> 00:19:27,516
Reg found quite a good job, too.

361
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:29,557
We soon fitted in.

362
00:19:29,641 --> 00:19:31,597
Then Stevie came along.

363
00:19:31,681 --> 00:19:33,876
And we got quite settled, really.

364
00:19:33,961 --> 00:19:36,998
These streets looked rough
and there were rats.

365
00:19:37,081 --> 00:19:39,037
But life was quite good here.

366
00:19:39,121 --> 00:19:43,034
Some places were boarded up
with the upstairs windows empty.

367
00:19:43,121 --> 00:19:46,796
Others were crammed full
with people and kiddies.

368
00:19:46,881 --> 00:19:50,112
Once I heard sounds coming
from one of the boarded-up houses.

369
00:19:50,201 --> 00:19:52,556
It sounded like a baby crying.

370
00:19:52,641 --> 00:19:54,871
- Stevie...
- (Squawks)

371
00:19:54,961 --> 00:19:57,555
(Midlands man) I went to a house
the other week.

372
00:19:57,641 --> 00:20:00,599
Woman come out...
it's not too good, I tell you...

373
00:20:00,681 --> 00:20:04,390
.. and she come out
in her knickers and bras.

374
00:20:04,961 --> 00:20:06,872
That's the sort of people I meet.

375
00:20:06,961 --> 00:20:10,271
(Old man) The women used to scrub
the pavements every morning

376
00:20:10,361 --> 00:20:12,317
to keep 'em clean.

377
00:20:12,401 --> 00:20:15,757
(Woman) Me sister came to see me
last week from Yardley.

378
00:20:15,841 --> 00:20:17,832
When she seen the street, she said

379
00:20:17,921 --> 00:20:21,311
"My godfathers, whatever possessed
you to live in a street like this?"

380
00:20:21,401 --> 00:20:24,757
(Man) You knew everybody
and everybody was friendly, like.

381
00:20:24,841 --> 00:20:28,356
But you don't know anybody now and
they're a different class altogether.

382
00:20:28,441 --> 00:20:32,992
(Woman) You'll meet friends in here
and they're very, very nice friends.

383
00:20:33,081 --> 00:20:35,276
You can have a laugh and a joke.

384
00:20:35,361 --> 00:20:39,593
I might have me funny ways, but
I'm a kind-hearted old bit of sugar.

385
00:20:39,681 --> 00:20:45,711
I'm harmless. I'm just an old bag
that has got nobody to turn to.

386
00:20:45,801 --> 00:20:47,792
What happened to Mr Alley, then?

387
00:20:47,881 --> 00:20:51,669
Things have gone too far with these
places, there's too many people.

388
00:20:51,761 --> 00:20:54,753
- The plaster's coming off the walls.
- I hadn't noticed that.

389
00:20:54,841 --> 00:20:58,390
Pull the chain
and half the ceiling comes down.

390
00:20:58,481 --> 00:21:00,437
It's the bloomin' old cistern.

391
00:21:00,521 --> 00:21:03,638
If there's a queue waiting,
one can't follow the other.

392
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:08,511
(Woman) I've seen all sorts
of changes, from better to worse.

393
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:11,957
Everybody had window boxes
when I first come up here.

394
00:21:13,281 --> 00:21:16,876
(Mrs Alley) Now, my dear,
once I had a profession.

395
00:21:16,961 --> 00:21:20,397
- Can you guess what it was?
- (Cathy) Ooh, I don't know.

396
00:21:20,481 --> 00:21:24,520
- I was a whore, dear.
- Ooh, you weren't, Mrs Alley!

397
00:21:24,601 --> 00:21:26,717
A whore.

398
00:21:26,801 --> 00:21:28,837
Long time ago.

399
00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:31,594
But I was lovely then.

400
00:21:31,681 --> 00:21:35,754
Had the fellas wild for me, I did,
when I was a whore.

401
00:21:35,841 --> 00:21:39,800
Oh, I've got something
I want you to do for me.

402
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:42,873
Will you read this letter
for me, dear?

403
00:21:42,961 --> 00:21:45,031
It's one of me old favourites,

404
00:21:45,121 --> 00:21:48,397
and me eyes are not so good
these days.

405
00:21:52,361 --> 00:21:54,829
Oh, Mrs Alley, it's all about sex!

406
00:21:54,921 --> 00:21:58,231
Fancy you getting me to read
your sexy letters for you!

407
00:21:58,321 --> 00:22:01,836
(Woman) There's a caff down the road
and they have a striptease.

408
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:05,277
Every night there's kids hanging
round to get in and see 'em.

409
00:22:05,361 --> 00:22:07,829
It puts ideas in the kids' heads.

410
00:22:07,921 --> 00:22:11,630
Stephen, what are you doing?
I told you not to play with the dirt.

411
00:22:11,721 --> 00:22:13,677
Look at your clean jeans.

412
00:22:13,761 --> 00:22:17,390
Put that down. And you, Sean.
Look at you, you're filthy.

413
00:22:17,481 --> 00:22:19,597
(Cathy) Now I was pregnant again.

414
00:22:19,681 --> 00:22:23,117
Some say it's wrong to have another
kiddie when you're overcrowded.

415
00:22:23,201 --> 00:22:25,157
But I don't think so.

416
00:22:25,241 --> 00:22:27,232
I think kiddies are God's gift.

417
00:22:27,321 --> 00:22:30,870
You do wrong to deprive anyone
of the chance of life.

418
00:22:30,961 --> 00:22:32,952
Love's what's important
in a child's life.

419
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:36,033
Love is more important
than nice surroundings.

420
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:39,158
I know, cos I lived
in a "respectable" home.

421
00:22:39,241 --> 00:22:41,277
And I didn't have it.

422
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:44,990
(Woman) We have to sleep in
the attic, like, and it's quite damp.

423
00:22:45,081 --> 00:22:48,312
He wallpapered it about three weeks
before I had the baby,

424
00:22:48,401 --> 00:22:52,189
and the far wall is starting
to come down already.

425
00:22:52,281 --> 00:22:55,000
- Help!
- Mrs Alley, are you all right?

426
00:22:55,081 --> 00:22:58,278
I fell through the bed!
Thank you, ducks, thank you.

427
00:22:58,361 --> 00:23:00,317
I'm very grateful to you, ducks.

428
00:23:00,401 --> 00:23:04,076
Mrs Alley, I can't pull any harder,
I'll lose the baby!

429
00:23:04,161 --> 00:23:06,117
Aren't I a silly girl?

430
00:23:06,841 --> 00:23:08,832
Pull me, harder!

431
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:11,151
Oh, I wets the bed, see?

432
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:14,878
I wets the bed
and the springs get rotted.

433
00:23:14,961 --> 00:23:17,270
See these pigeons flying across?

434
00:23:17,361 --> 00:23:20,592
I've got one coming from Barcelona
and he's very tired.

435
00:23:20,681 --> 00:23:23,275
Dad, the pigeon there.

436
00:23:24,241 --> 00:23:26,232
Come on!

437
00:23:26,881 --> 00:23:30,760
I'll send that cat up after you.
Now come in! Come on!

438
00:23:30,841 --> 00:23:33,071
(Whistles) Come on!

439
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:35,152
Come on!

440
00:23:37,321 --> 00:23:39,277
(Child murmurs)

441
00:23:39,361 --> 00:23:41,352
(Whispers)
Shh! Sean, be quiet! Good boy.

442
00:23:41,441 --> 00:23:43,591
(Cathy) I felt we were honoured,
somehow,

443
00:23:43,681 --> 00:23:46,036
that pigeon
coming all the way back to us.

444
00:23:46,121 --> 00:23:49,511
Mrs Alley, can I have a word with you
for a minute?

445
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:52,350
Give me a lift up, dear.

446
00:23:52,441 --> 00:23:55,080
- Can you manage?
- Thank you.

447
00:23:55,161 --> 00:23:59,120
Mrs Alley, would it be all right
if we owed the rent for a few weeks?

448
00:23:59,201 --> 00:24:03,399
Only you see, what with the pigeons
and Reg isn't earning much now.

449
00:24:03,481 --> 00:24:05,676
Owe the rent, ducks?

450
00:24:05,761 --> 00:24:08,878
Course you can,
but I want to be paid.

451
00:24:08,961 --> 00:24:11,714
- Oh, we'll pay you.
- I'll have to be paid.

452
00:24:11,801 --> 00:24:16,511
You see, as old as I seem,
I don't qualify for a pension.

453
00:24:16,601 --> 00:24:19,069
I look older than I really am.

454
00:24:19,161 --> 00:24:21,516
(Irish woman)
The children'd have a good time

455
00:24:21,601 --> 00:24:24,195
if people'd mind their own business
and let them.

456
00:24:24,281 --> 00:24:28,160
One's name was Sean
and one's was Stephen.

457
00:24:28,241 --> 00:24:31,597
And they lived in a little cottage
by the seaside.

458
00:24:31,681 --> 00:24:35,071
- And every day...
- Did they?

459
00:24:35,161 --> 00:24:37,550
Reg! Reg!

460
00:24:38,001 --> 00:24:40,913
It's Mrs Alley! She's dead!

461
00:24:46,161 --> 00:24:49,119
(Cathy) The men from the council
came along.

462
00:24:49,201 --> 00:24:51,317
Took away her odd bits and pieces.

463
00:24:51,401 --> 00:24:54,871
They looked through the letters for
notes of any relatives she may have.

464
00:24:54,961 --> 00:24:56,917
But she hadn't got none.

465
00:24:57,641 --> 00:25:00,917
Only letters from her old clients,
that's all.

466
00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:04,437
So there was no-one
to pay the death grant to.

467
00:25:12,441 --> 00:25:14,113
Oh, yes?

468
00:25:14,201 --> 00:25:18,240
I represent a nephew of the deceased,
Mrs Alley what died last week.

469
00:25:18,321 --> 00:25:22,200
My client now needs the unpaid rent
for the current week.

470
00:25:22,281 --> 00:25:25,990
And the back period, during which
he gathers you was in arrears.

471
00:25:26,081 --> 00:25:30,472
In arrears? You sure? I didn't know
Mrs Alley had any relatives.

472
00:25:30,561 --> 00:25:33,792
- Well, she does.
- I can't oblige you at the moment.

473
00:25:33,881 --> 00:25:38,352
Mrs Alley said we could owe the rent
for a few weeks while my Reg was ill.

474
00:25:38,441 --> 00:25:41,911
Now he's better we'll pay you,
course we will.

475
00:25:42,401 --> 00:25:44,631
Just give us a few weeks, that's all.

476
00:25:44,721 --> 00:25:47,315
I'll even go out to work as well.

477
00:25:47,401 --> 00:25:51,519
What Mrs Alley said and what
my client wants are very different.

478
00:25:51,601 --> 00:25:54,195
So you'd better find some way to pay.

479
00:25:54,281 --> 00:25:57,990
You couldn't talk to him. It was
hopeless trying to talk to him.

480
00:25:58,081 --> 00:26:00,197
What, three months in arrears?

481
00:26:00,281 --> 00:26:03,637
I'll knock his block in.
Who's he think he's talking to?

482
00:26:03,721 --> 00:26:05,996
How long is it since he's been round?

483
00:26:06,081 --> 00:26:08,037
Four weeks.

484
00:26:08,121 --> 00:26:10,396
He says here we owe him three months.

485
00:26:10,481 --> 00:26:13,917
Who are we supposed to pay
this rent to?

486
00:26:14,001 --> 00:26:16,959
He never comes round,
how's he expect to collect it?

487
00:26:17,041 --> 00:26:18,997
Have another look at the letter.

488
00:26:19,081 --> 00:26:21,151
It says here he's gonna kick us out.

489
00:26:21,241 --> 00:26:24,517
They can't evict you these days,
I saw they passed a law.

490
00:26:24,601 --> 00:26:27,274
- It's nonsense.
- It says here he can.

491
00:26:27,361 --> 00:26:31,877
Look, I've told you we'll pay you
if only you'll give us time.

492
00:26:31,961 --> 00:26:33,917
I know your game.

493
00:26:34,001 --> 00:26:36,879
You want us out so you can charge
someone else key money.

494
00:26:36,961 --> 00:26:40,670
My client needs this place for his
relatives, so you'd better get out.

495
00:26:40,761 --> 00:26:43,275
You may've heard eviction is illegal,

496
00:26:43,361 --> 00:26:46,831
but if a relative wants a house,
you can still be evicted.

497
00:26:46,921 --> 00:26:50,470
- Are you sure about that?
- And we'll get a court order.

498
00:26:50,561 --> 00:26:55,271
- But we're protected tenants!
- You've had time to pay up.

499
00:26:55,361 --> 00:26:58,239
The defendant persistently
refused to pay his rent,

500
00:26:58,321 --> 00:27:01,472
and the landlord
must also put the premises right

501
00:27:01,561 --> 00:27:03,517
at a cost of several hundred pounds.

502
00:27:03,601 --> 00:27:05,592
(Judge) What have you got to say?

503
00:27:05,681 --> 00:27:07,717
I say it's all a pack of lies.

504
00:27:07,801 --> 00:27:09,951
I mean, for the first thing,

505
00:27:10,041 --> 00:27:13,477
Mrs Alley said we didn't have to pay
any rent cos I wasn't working.

506
00:27:13,561 --> 00:27:16,917
Then this bloke comes round
and says he wants the rent.

507
00:27:17,001 --> 00:27:19,117
But when I goes round to him
with it, he won't accept it.

508
00:27:19,201 --> 00:27:22,876
I'm not satisfied that the defendant
is telling the truth.

509
00:27:22,961 --> 00:27:27,671
In addition, he has "mislaid" the
rent book given to him by Mrs Alley.

510
00:27:27,761 --> 00:27:30,150
I take the case as proved.

511
00:27:30,241 --> 00:27:33,631
We'll grant an eviction order
dated four weeks from now.

512
00:27:33,721 --> 00:27:36,952
(Cathy) So we tried.
We wrote letters, wrote after places.

513
00:27:37,041 --> 00:27:39,032
Never got no answer.

514
00:27:39,121 --> 00:27:41,351
The next answer we got
was "no children".

515
00:27:41,441 --> 00:27:43,397
"No children accepted. "

516
00:27:43,481 --> 00:27:47,474
I went to an agent and he said
they'd find us a place

517
00:27:47,561 --> 00:27:50,439
if we gave them 20%%% of a year's rent

518
00:27:50,521 --> 00:27:52,716
and 10%%% of fixtures and fittings.

519
00:27:52,801 --> 00:27:54,757
Which I thought was unjust.

520
00:27:54,841 --> 00:27:57,913
And I wrote letters
and the rent was too high.

521
00:27:58,001 --> 00:28:02,119
There was one place we went to
and I thought we had a chance.

522
00:28:02,201 --> 00:28:06,274
They said?6. Next thing we heard,
someone had offered 'em?8,

523
00:28:06,361 --> 00:28:08,397
so that put the cap on that.

524
00:28:08,481 --> 00:28:11,234
Other letters we got,?10 a week.

525
00:28:11,321 --> 00:28:15,200
Because Reg couldn't afford it,
not on his wages,

526
00:28:15,281 --> 00:28:17,920
it meant that we'd be living on
next to nothing.

527
00:28:18,001 --> 00:28:21,152
(Man) Birmingham, 39,000 families
on the waiting list.

528
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:23,675
Leeds, 13,500.

529
00:28:23,761 --> 00:28:25,831
Liverpool, 19,000.

530
00:28:25,921 --> 00:28:28,594
Manchester, nearly 15,000.

531
00:28:29,481 --> 00:28:31,517
(Cathy) It wasn't long
before I realised something.

532
00:28:31,601 --> 00:28:34,035
We'd been lucky to get the old place.

533
00:28:34,121 --> 00:28:36,191
There didn't seem to be
anything for us any more.

534
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:39,273
(Man) In Liverpool, one household
in nine is on the waiting list.

535
00:28:39,361 --> 00:28:41,556
In Manchester it's one in fourteen.

536
00:28:41,641 --> 00:28:46,476
Birmingham has 4,000 overcrowded
houses, twelve people to a house.

537
00:28:46,561 --> 00:28:49,837
- Is that yours?
- Yes, it's just us and my husband.

538
00:28:49,921 --> 00:28:51,877
Sorry, duck, no children.

539
00:28:51,961 --> 00:28:55,954
If I had a couple of elephants they'd
have said "Leave them in the yard. "

540
00:28:56,041 --> 00:29:00,034
But children? They'd say "Sorry,
we can't have nothing like that. "

541
00:29:00,121 --> 00:29:02,681
It was as if they thought
it was a crime to have children.

542
00:29:02,761 --> 00:29:04,956
(Man) A million homeless families.

543
00:29:05,041 --> 00:29:08,590
You may have a teenage brother
and sister who have to share a bed.

544
00:29:08,681 --> 00:29:11,832
Maybe a crippled person on
the top floor as can never go out,

545
00:29:11,921 --> 00:29:14,389
or perhaps sharing with relatives,

546
00:29:14,481 --> 00:29:18,440
or maybe, like yourselves,
they've had an order of eviction.

547
00:29:18,521 --> 00:29:23,834
Now, to house these 8,000 units,
we have 500 new dwellings every year.

548
00:29:23,921 --> 00:29:28,312
People's needs
are assessed on points:

549
00:29:28,401 --> 00:29:31,438
one for health risk, one for every
year they've lived in the borough

550
00:29:31,521 --> 00:29:33,477
and one for having no bath.

551
00:29:33,561 --> 00:29:36,439
You just haven't got enough points
to qualify.

552
00:29:36,521 --> 00:29:39,831
But in view of the gravity
of the situation,

553
00:29:39,921 --> 00:29:43,630
I'll see if we can
jump you up the queue a bit.

554
00:29:43,721 --> 00:29:46,360
- Oh, thank you.
- Also in view of the situation,

555
00:29:46,441 --> 00:29:50,070
I'll try and get you a place
on the new Smithson estate.

556
00:29:50,161 --> 00:29:53,039
(Cathy) We had a little girl next.
We called her Mylene.

557
00:29:53,121 --> 00:29:55,476
It was Reg's choice, not mine.

558
00:29:55,561 --> 00:29:58,633
She weighed 8Ib 5oz at birth!
Quite a heavyweight.

559
00:29:58,721 --> 00:30:01,030
One day, we had a visit
from the man from the council.

560
00:30:01,121 --> 00:30:02,759
- Mr Ward?
- Yeah.

561
00:30:02,841 --> 00:30:05,309
I'm from
the Public Health Department.

562
00:30:05,401 --> 00:30:07,039
Oh, yeah.

563
00:30:07,121 --> 00:30:09,191
I gather you're living in one room

564
00:30:09,281 --> 00:30:12,637
because the room upstairs is too damp
for the kiddies to sleep in.

565
00:30:12,721 --> 00:30:14,234
Yeah.

566
00:30:14,321 --> 00:30:16,596
Sorry, we'll have to move you out.

567
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:19,639
- We're being evicted anyway.
- Are you? When's that?

568
00:30:19,721 --> 00:30:23,191
- Next Tuesday.
- That saves me a bit of trouble.

569
00:30:23,281 --> 00:30:27,752
It saves me from having to do
something I don't really believe in.

570
00:30:27,841 --> 00:30:31,470
- Good day to you.
- Faceless man!

571
00:30:31,561 --> 00:30:34,280
Why doesn't he do something about it?

572
00:30:34,361 --> 00:30:36,317
(Cathy) Got like a madhouse.

573
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:39,996
They pulled the washing off the line,
lights pulled out of their sockets.

574
00:30:40,081 --> 00:30:43,118
We even had windows taken
from their frames.

575
00:30:43,201 --> 00:30:46,079
Someone turned the water off and
the electric wires got pulled out.

576
00:30:46,161 --> 00:30:48,356
(Man) There is another side.
Our side.

577
00:30:48,441 --> 00:30:51,558
- I'm speaking for authorities...
- (Corrugated iron rattles)

578
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,916
.. responsible for the property.

579
00:30:54,001 --> 00:30:55,957
Now, I know it's quite common

580
00:30:56,041 --> 00:30:59,397
for the police to be brought in
for an eviction.

581
00:30:59,481 --> 00:31:01,676
But it does get people's backs up.

582
00:31:01,761 --> 00:31:04,400
It's bad publicity for the company
that owns the place,

583
00:31:04,481 --> 00:31:07,279
particularly when it is
a reputable body of churchmen

584
00:31:07,361 --> 00:31:10,876
who, through the application
of good business methods,

585
00:31:10,961 --> 00:31:15,477
are in the position of
seeming to do an injustice.

586
00:31:16,121 --> 00:31:18,157
(Banging and hammering)

587
00:31:25,801 --> 00:31:29,077
- Come along, then.
- That's it, then, Cath.

588
00:31:29,161 --> 00:31:31,277
Come on, Stephen.

589
00:31:31,361 --> 00:31:33,397
Up you get. That's a good boy.

590
00:31:33,481 --> 00:31:36,996
Up you get. Come on, Sean.

591
00:31:37,081 --> 00:31:39,117
It's all right, come on.

592
00:31:39,201 --> 00:31:41,192
All right, Cath?

593
00:31:50,161 --> 00:31:52,117
(Woman) Never mind.

594
00:31:54,601 --> 00:31:58,560
Hey, mister, want me to store
your furniture, pound a week?

595
00:31:58,641 --> 00:32:00,836
Oh, go away, will you?

596
00:32:05,721 --> 00:32:07,712
(Children chatter)

597
00:32:14,521 --> 00:32:16,955
- Now, move out the way.
- Leave the kid alone!

598
00:32:17,041 --> 00:32:18,997
I'm only doing my job.

599
00:32:19,081 --> 00:32:22,835
Reg, come on, don't be silly.
Come on over here. Calm down.

600
00:32:22,921 --> 00:32:26,550
He only wants his toys.
It's nothing too much, is it?

601
00:32:26,641 --> 00:32:28,597
(Chatter)

602
00:32:29,161 --> 00:32:32,597
- I mean, we still own the property.
- Careful with that chair!

603
00:32:35,241 --> 00:32:39,632
- How much longer?
- Only about five minutes now.

604
00:32:39,721 --> 00:32:42,394
- It's just down here somewhere.
- I'm getting tired, Reg.

605
00:32:42,481 --> 00:32:44,870
Hang on, look. Here, hang on.

606
00:32:44,961 --> 00:32:47,429
D'you want to swap over?
Can you hold the pram?

607
00:32:47,521 --> 00:32:51,833
I told you not to buy 'em ice creams,
look at the state they're in.

608
00:32:51,921 --> 00:32:54,389
Oh, there you are.

609
00:32:54,481 --> 00:32:59,111
They're gonna get this road done up,
they told me, in a couple of months.

610
00:32:59,201 --> 00:33:01,556
It gets very bad in the winter.

611
00:33:01,641 --> 00:33:05,316
It's not very nice, is it, Reg?
What are all these cars doing here?

612
00:33:05,401 --> 00:33:08,677
It's a sort of a dump. The council
are trying to do something about it.

613
00:33:08,761 --> 00:33:11,673
(Woman)
I wouldn't go back to a house.

614
00:33:11,761 --> 00:33:15,276
I never look at housing adverts
or in house agents' windows.

615
00:33:15,361 --> 00:33:19,240
We tried councils,
we tried welfare, we...

616
00:33:19,321 --> 00:33:21,710
.. even tried to get tied cottages.

617
00:33:21,801 --> 00:33:24,269
Everything just fell through.

618
00:33:24,361 --> 00:33:26,317
Caravan was the last resort.

619
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:28,877
And I hate it.

620
00:33:29,681 --> 00:33:30,955
Er...

621
00:33:32,521 --> 00:33:34,591
Up that way. Over there.

622
00:33:34,681 --> 00:33:37,878
- Which one?
- That one there. That's it.

623
00:33:37,961 --> 00:33:39,917
Well, we're here, then.

624
00:33:40,001 --> 00:33:43,311
(Man) You used to go to big fairs
and buy and sell horses.

625
00:33:43,401 --> 00:33:46,359
That was the living.
I'd love to go back on the roads.

626
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:49,877
If we pull inside the roads
as we used to years ago,

627
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:52,031
the police come along

628
00:33:52,121 --> 00:33:55,113
and you go to court
and we don't know where to go to.

629
00:33:55,201 --> 00:33:57,351
- You gonna live here, mister?
- Yeah, love.

630
00:33:57,441 --> 00:33:59,397
Mind out, love.

631
00:34:03,481 --> 00:34:05,631
Now, put that down, Sean.

632
00:34:10,841 --> 00:34:13,309
Well, what d'you think of it,
then, Cath?

633
00:34:14,241 --> 00:34:17,597
- Could be worse.
- Come on, love, it's not that bad.

634
00:34:17,681 --> 00:34:19,672
Is there any light?

635
00:34:19,761 --> 00:34:21,638
Yeah, I'll show you in a minute.

636
00:34:22,801 --> 00:34:25,440
- Like the wood?
- Yeah, it's a bit dirty.

637
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:27,477
Sit down here, I'll show you.

638
00:34:27,561 --> 00:34:29,517
That's it.

639
00:34:29,601 --> 00:34:33,389
Now, it's quite easy to operate,
Cath. It's not difficult.

640
00:34:33,481 --> 00:34:36,917
You'll be able to do it yourself.
I'll just show you how it works.

641
00:34:37,001 --> 00:34:39,196
You need a box of matches.

642
00:34:39,921 --> 00:34:41,957
Er... now.

643
00:34:43,121 --> 00:34:45,510
Stick a match through there.

644
00:34:46,801 --> 00:34:49,679
And... that's it.

645
00:34:49,761 --> 00:34:51,911
- It's gone out, Reg.
- Oh.

646
00:34:52,681 --> 00:34:54,990
(Cathy) It wasn't too bad, really.

647
00:34:55,081 --> 00:34:57,595
The wind was getting up outside
in the marsh.

648
00:34:57,681 --> 00:35:00,275
It made it feel quite snug inside.

649
00:35:00,361 --> 00:35:03,159
It felt funny to be in a caravan.

650
00:35:03,241 --> 00:35:06,916
I'd only been in one once before,
on summer holiday.

651
00:35:07,001 --> 00:35:09,640
It was a relief, though, really.

652
00:35:09,721 --> 00:35:13,953
I think it was the tension we'd been
living under the past few weeks.

653
00:35:14,121 --> 00:35:16,635
And you got the light, you see.

654
00:35:16,721 --> 00:35:20,316
It's very efficient, it does
the whole room and it's warm as well.

655
00:35:20,401 --> 00:35:22,357
Like it?

656
00:35:22,881 --> 00:35:24,758
(Baby grizzles)

657
00:35:26,001 --> 00:35:28,720
- Yeah, she's tired.
- (Child) Night-night!

658
00:35:28,801 --> 00:35:30,678
Bacon, better have that
before it goes off.

659
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:32,717
Come on, now.

660
00:35:32,801 --> 00:35:34,951
Go to sleep.

661
00:35:35,481 --> 00:35:38,041
- Good night!
- Good night!

662
00:35:38,641 --> 00:35:42,395
- How'll we fit another bed in here?
- I'll show you.

663
00:35:42,481 --> 00:35:44,437
Here we are.

664
00:35:44,521 --> 00:35:46,557
Oh, I see!

665
00:35:46,641 --> 00:35:50,190
- That's very clever, isn't it?
- It's all right, it's all right.

666
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:52,590
- It's quite comfy, too.
- Yeah.

667
00:35:53,761 --> 00:35:55,797
You sure we're safe here, Reg?

668
00:35:55,881 --> 00:35:58,520
I mean, they won't come and get us,
will they?

669
00:35:58,601 --> 00:36:02,071
- They won't move us on?
- From here? No, don't worry.

670
00:36:02,161 --> 00:36:05,358
They won't come and look for us here
amongst all this lot.

671
00:36:05,441 --> 00:36:09,036
We may have dropped a peg, Cath,
but I think we'll be a lot contenter.

672
00:36:09,121 --> 00:36:13,433
Later the wind got stronger. It began
to rock the place around quite a lot.

673
00:36:13,521 --> 00:36:15,477
(Giggling)

674
00:36:15,561 --> 00:36:18,394
(Old woman) I like a van,
you get all the air round you.

675
00:36:18,481 --> 00:36:21,791
- You know I'm 86?
- You're not!

676
00:36:21,881 --> 00:36:25,590
86, and I don't think
a house would suit me.

677
00:36:25,681 --> 00:36:28,514
You know, in a house
you can't breathe.

678
00:36:28,601 --> 00:36:30,796
And I like air, I like fresh air.

679
00:36:30,881 --> 00:36:35,113
You know, it makes...
It's beautiful, fresh air.

680
00:36:35,201 --> 00:36:37,999
(Cathy) There's no roadway at all,
it's just a road of mud.

681
00:36:38,081 --> 00:36:40,675
The scrapheap's
all the way up the lane.

682
00:36:40,761 --> 00:36:43,070
We get fires nearly every day.

683
00:36:43,161 --> 00:36:46,198
The caravans are very close together.

684
00:36:46,281 --> 00:36:51,799
We have to walk a couple of hundred
yards to empty a chemical toilet.

685
00:36:51,881 --> 00:36:55,760
(Man) In a house, it's all four walls
and you're closed in,

686
00:36:55,841 --> 00:36:58,674
just like a bird penned up in a cage.

687
00:36:59,481 --> 00:37:01,312
(Giggling)

688
00:37:01,401 --> 00:37:06,077
To get the fuel to come down to us,
well, they just won't come.

689
00:37:06,161 --> 00:37:11,189
With the state of that road, the mud
and the bumps, there's too much...

690
00:37:11,281 --> 00:37:14,079
Another thing I can't understand,
it's the drivers who say:

691
00:37:14,161 --> 00:37:16,994
"We're not coming down there,"
yet they're the same as we are.

692
00:37:17,081 --> 00:37:20,960
(Irish man) People look at me and say
"He's just a dirty old gypsy. "

693
00:37:21,041 --> 00:37:23,157
But we're not dirty, we're clean.

694
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,277
And we keep ourselves clean.

695
00:37:25,361 --> 00:37:28,956
I'll tell you why:
because we wash ourselves.

696
00:37:29,041 --> 00:37:32,397
And we don't need any of them
flush baths, either. Our way is this.

697
00:37:32,481 --> 00:37:35,791
Get a bucket of water and we wash
ourselves down to the waist.

698
00:37:35,881 --> 00:37:38,759
When that part's done,
roll your shirt down,

699
00:37:38,841 --> 00:37:42,834
take off your trousers
and wash yourself up to the bottom.

700
00:37:42,921 --> 00:37:45,640
- What, in the open air?
- Certainly, of course.

701
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:49,999
I'll tell you something else: you'll
never find no fleas, lice nor louse,

702
00:37:50,081 --> 00:37:52,959
cos we know how to thwart them
with the devil's dung.

703
00:37:53,041 --> 00:37:56,397
- What's that, then?
- You get it in the chemist's.

704
00:37:56,481 --> 00:37:58,995
It does have a bit of a sting,
mark you...

705
00:37:59,081 --> 00:38:04,155
(Man) You can always tell a traveller
by the way he walks and acts,

706
00:38:04,241 --> 00:38:06,630
same as I can tell a policeman.

707
00:38:06,721 --> 00:38:08,757
I could really smell a policeman.

708
00:38:08,841 --> 00:38:13,676
(Woman) We feel free because we can
see the open fields from our window,

709
00:38:13,761 --> 00:38:16,833
we don't have people living
all on top of us

710
00:38:16,921 --> 00:38:20,072
and yet we can live in a decent,
civilised manner.

711
00:38:20,161 --> 00:38:22,595
(Child)
Next door there's loads of rats.

712
00:38:22,681 --> 00:38:26,674
At night you can hear them
under our caravan, all squeak.

713
00:38:26,761 --> 00:38:28,672
(Laughter)

714
00:38:28,761 --> 00:38:33,118
Once you're in a caravan,
you've gone as low as you can go,

715
00:38:33,201 --> 00:38:36,238
unless it's on the street
or in the halfway houses.

716
00:38:36,321 --> 00:38:41,270
When Mr Jones came out of the Forces,
he tried hard to find places.

717
00:38:41,361 --> 00:38:43,352
But the money he got was no good.

718
00:38:43,441 --> 00:38:45,671
As the kids came along it got worse.

719
00:38:45,761 --> 00:38:50,551
He went down the mines,
he went as a driver on the buses,

720
00:38:50,641 --> 00:38:55,157
but each time the rent
was far too much for his wages.

721
00:38:55,241 --> 00:38:59,314
He tried to get jobs in the forestry,
but each time we were turned down.

722
00:38:59,401 --> 00:39:04,111
- Nothing really regular.
- He did the forestry as a POW.

723
00:39:04,201 --> 00:39:06,669
(Cathy) Reg got a job
picking blackcurrants.

724
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:11,471
Then he got more work at the airport
on the new runway.

725
00:39:11,561 --> 00:39:15,713
Then picking gooseberries.
The kids like life here, too.

726
00:39:15,801 --> 00:39:19,191
They were always finding things
among the trees.

727
00:39:19,281 --> 00:39:22,637
I got to like it here as well.
I don't know why.

728
00:39:22,721 --> 00:39:25,952
I know it was squalid,
but it was easy-going.

729
00:39:26,041 --> 00:39:28,999
Only sometimes the filth
got on my nerves.

730
00:39:29,081 --> 00:39:31,641
I felt as if we'd sunk somehow
out of the race.

731
00:39:31,721 --> 00:39:34,110
Things didn't seem to matter
down here no more.

732
00:39:34,201 --> 00:39:36,157
There was no-one to move us on.

733
00:39:36,241 --> 00:39:39,074
Reg and me reckoned
we might stay here for a while.

734
00:39:39,161 --> 00:39:42,198
Well, it was a life. We were happy.

735
00:39:42,441 --> 00:39:45,638
What we are pressing for
is the fencing-off of the common land

736
00:39:45,721 --> 00:39:49,077
so that the gypsies and layabouts
can no longer get on it.

737
00:39:49,161 --> 00:39:52,710
Now it is the traditional camping
place of the gypsies, of course.

738
00:39:52,801 --> 00:39:54,792
No-one is denying that.

739
00:39:54,881 --> 00:39:59,033
But these are not real gypsies,
they're just scroungers, layabouts.

740
00:39:59,121 --> 00:40:03,672
These are the words that spring to
mind when contemplating these people.

741
00:40:03,761 --> 00:40:08,915
And of course, with the new housing
development, of which we are part,

742
00:40:09,001 --> 00:40:12,596
the character of the area
must be expected to change.

743
00:40:12,681 --> 00:40:15,400
We can accept no hindrance from those

744
00:40:15,481 --> 00:40:18,314
who willfully try
to keep us in the past.

745
00:40:18,401 --> 00:40:22,189
There is no longer room
for slums on wheels.

746
00:40:22,281 --> 00:40:24,272
Many of these people are not gypsies.

747
00:40:24,361 --> 00:40:26,750
They're here because they can't find
anywhere else to live.

748
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:29,753
Where would the Association's
sympathies lie

749
00:40:29,841 --> 00:40:31,832
in the event of violence?

750
00:40:31,921 --> 00:40:35,960
I'm afraid our sympathies
will be very much with ourselves.

751
00:40:36,201 --> 00:40:39,796
(Man) The council has wasted
enough time on these gypsies.

752
00:40:39,881 --> 00:40:43,112
They give nothing
towards the council.

753
00:40:43,201 --> 00:40:46,989
- Right, mate, I'll get you!
- Why should we support them?

754
00:40:47,081 --> 00:40:49,595
(Man) Young respectable couples
can't get housing loans.

755
00:40:49,681 --> 00:40:51,751
Who would we rather have the money?

756
00:40:52,681 --> 00:40:55,400
- Cherries, apples.
- Pea picking.

757
00:40:55,481 --> 00:40:58,598
Hops. Bert and I helped
to make that, didn't we?

758
00:40:58,681 --> 00:41:01,957
D'you want another? No, I'll get 'em.

759
00:41:02,041 --> 00:41:03,997
(Fireworks)

760
00:41:05,681 --> 00:41:08,479
Potato picking.
That's how I met the missus.

761
00:41:08,561 --> 00:41:11,917
I'd been out potato picking,
had a few pints, you know.

762
00:41:12,001 --> 00:41:15,391
And I had to go into this ditch,
and there she was.

763
00:41:15,481 --> 00:41:18,120
- Asleep, was she?
- No, she'd had a few pints too!

764
00:41:21,041 --> 00:41:24,272
If you got it off someone
you know's OK...

765
00:41:24,361 --> 00:41:26,397
The caravan's burning!

766
00:41:26,481 --> 00:41:28,517
(Women shouting and screaming)

767
00:41:29,281 --> 00:41:31,590
(Man) Get back!

768
00:41:33,801 --> 00:41:37,714
(Well-spoken man) Why were you
living there in the first place?

769
00:41:37,801 --> 00:41:39,837
We was evicted from
a council house in Stoke.

770
00:41:39,921 --> 00:41:41,912
Where were you
on the night of the fire?

771
00:41:42,001 --> 00:41:44,196
We went out to buy some dolls
for the kids.

772
00:41:44,281 --> 00:41:46,237
On the way back,
we stopped for a quick one.

773
00:41:46,321 --> 00:41:49,279
Did you and your wife
have to be out together?

774
00:41:49,361 --> 00:41:51,750
Mrs Jones can't drive, and I wanted
her advice about the dolls.

775
00:41:51,841 --> 00:41:55,470
There are times when a husband
and wife have to go out together.

776
00:41:55,561 --> 00:41:58,359
And I would say, sir,
that this was murder!

777
00:41:58,441 --> 00:42:00,796
It's the kids from the new estate.

778
00:42:00,881 --> 00:42:03,839
And the adults
just seem to encourage them.

779
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:06,640
(Lawyer) Now, you are
the health inspector for this region.

780
00:42:06,721 --> 00:42:11,317
You have condemned houses 1,000 times
better than these caravans.

781
00:42:11,401 --> 00:42:14,552
(Health inspector) The local council
do have sympathy for these people.

782
00:42:14,641 --> 00:42:19,840
(Woman) I've got a baby in there!
I want to go and get it out!

783
00:42:19,921 --> 00:42:25,234
Pauline Jones, were you asleep in the
caravan on the night of April 25th?

784
00:42:25,321 --> 00:42:28,393
(Girl)
Yes, we was all six in the bed.

785
00:42:28,481 --> 00:42:31,837
I woke up cos the place
was full of smoke.

786
00:42:31,921 --> 00:42:35,630
So I grabbed little Gary in me arms
and got out.

787
00:42:35,721 --> 00:42:39,350
I see. Do you remember
what happened then?

788
00:42:40,521 --> 00:42:42,671
Well, all the others got burnt up.

789
00:42:42,761 --> 00:42:44,717
(Dog barks)

790
00:42:48,441 --> 00:42:51,797
They get the van and tow it over
the boundary into the next district.

791
00:42:51,881 --> 00:42:55,112
Then they leave it
on the side of the road

792
00:42:55,201 --> 00:42:58,432
and the police come and nick you
for being there!

793
00:42:58,521 --> 00:43:01,957
It's all on account of
not causing obstructions.

794
00:43:02,041 --> 00:43:04,111
(Cathy)
Reg was working at the airport.

795
00:43:04,201 --> 00:43:06,635
Some nights when he got back,
he couldn't find us

796
00:43:06,721 --> 00:43:10,270
and he'd worry about us,
so he got behind in his working.

797
00:43:10,361 --> 00:43:12,397
(Reg) We can't go on like this, Cath.

798
00:43:12,481 --> 00:43:17,077
We're gonna have to sell the caravan.
There must be somewhere for us.

799
00:43:17,441 --> 00:43:20,877
Fancy you paying out money
before you've even seen the place.

800
00:43:20,961 --> 00:43:24,590
I didn't know, Cath. He said we
could have the first floor front.

801
00:43:24,681 --> 00:43:27,559
We used to have people living here
but now we can't allow it.

802
00:43:27,641 --> 00:43:31,031
People tend to deteriorate
when they're living in a boat.

803
00:43:31,121 --> 00:43:33,271
We used to have 'em.

804
00:43:33,361 --> 00:43:35,511
But they turned the place
into a slum.

805
00:43:35,601 --> 00:43:39,037
If people want to come here
with their pleasure boats,

806
00:43:39,121 --> 00:43:41,077
it's all right by us.

807
00:43:41,161 --> 00:43:44,597
But living in 'em the whole time,
it's not helping anybody.

808
00:43:44,681 --> 00:43:48,833
- We had to ask 'em to go.
- What if they're homeless?

809
00:43:48,921 --> 00:43:51,151
Even so, it's not helping 'em.

810
00:43:51,241 --> 00:43:55,871
We had to get rid of 'em. It's not
helping 'em to help themselves.

811
00:43:56,001 --> 00:43:59,391
You people get so run down,
no wonder they won't have you.

812
00:43:59,481 --> 00:44:02,359
We get run down
because we haven't got no house.

813
00:44:02,441 --> 00:44:04,830
You've got the welfare state now,
you can't come to any real harm.

814
00:44:04,921 --> 00:44:08,834
Are you an inhabitant
of this borough? On the housing list?

815
00:44:08,921 --> 00:44:10,798
Yeah.

816
00:44:10,881 --> 00:44:13,600
Whereabouts on the list are you?
You must be pretty high.

817
00:44:13,681 --> 00:44:16,673
They say they're gonna get us a place
on the new Smithson estate.

818
00:44:16,761 --> 00:44:19,355
Come on, mind the fire,
play with the rope properly.

819
00:44:20,881 --> 00:44:22,872
(Children chatter)

820
00:44:24,721 --> 00:44:26,154
(Woman) Sheila!

821
00:44:26,241 --> 00:44:29,677
There you are. I'll tan your arse
when I get hold of you!

822
00:44:29,761 --> 00:44:31,717
Oh, hello.

823
00:44:32,321 --> 00:44:35,757
- Is she yours?
- Yes, she is.

824
00:44:35,841 --> 00:44:38,480
- D'you live here too?
- Yeah, next door.

825
00:44:38,561 --> 00:44:40,711
- How's your place?
- It's dreadful.

826
00:44:40,801 --> 00:44:44,316
- It's leaking everywhere, freezing.
- You got enough wood?

827
00:44:44,401 --> 00:44:48,110
I'm just gonna light a fire
and make her something to eat.

828
00:44:48,201 --> 00:44:52,035
She's starving, I suppose.
Hasn't had any food all morning.

829
00:44:52,121 --> 00:44:55,670
- There a lot like us here?
- Quite a few, you'd be surprised.

830
00:45:00,561 --> 00:45:02,711
(Rain spatters)

831
00:45:06,521 --> 00:45:09,274
- Can't you give me a hand?
- All right, love.

832
00:45:09,361 --> 00:45:12,353
I've got another one here.
Here you are.

833
00:45:13,201 --> 00:45:16,238
Hold it nice and tight.
I'll put this one in here.

834
00:45:16,321 --> 00:45:18,277
This is bloody ridiculous.

835
00:45:18,361 --> 00:45:21,433
- You all right?
- Sean's not very well, either.

836
00:45:21,521 --> 00:45:25,275
I don't know what you think, Reg,
but I think we've had it.

837
00:45:26,441 --> 00:45:29,478
I mean, they turned us out
the caravan, didn't they?

838
00:45:29,561 --> 00:45:31,950
Then they turned us out
the derelict house.

839
00:45:32,601 --> 00:45:35,877
Well, they're gonna find us here.
I know they will.

840
00:45:37,321 --> 00:45:39,312
I think we'll have to give up soon,

841
00:45:39,401 --> 00:45:41,835
or they'll take the kiddies away,
like that man said.

842
00:45:41,921 --> 00:45:45,038
Yeah, well, don't worry, love,
I've got?5, haven't I?

843
00:45:45,121 --> 00:45:47,555
Nice, these.

844
00:45:48,601 --> 00:45:51,718
You know what you're gonna do
tomorrow, then, Cath?

845
00:45:51,801 --> 00:45:56,317
Mm. Pity about that place,
that maisonette.

846
00:45:56,401 --> 00:45:58,392
But you do know
what you're gonna do now?

847
00:45:58,481 --> 00:46:02,520
You have an aunt in Northumberland,
but you don't know her address?

848
00:46:02,601 --> 00:46:05,752
I haven't seen her since I was seven.
She might be dead.

849
00:46:05,841 --> 00:46:09,277
Have you any friends
or other relatives

850
00:46:09,361 --> 00:46:11,352
who might help with accommodation?

851
00:46:11,441 --> 00:46:13,397
If I had I wouldn't be here, would I?

852
00:46:13,481 --> 00:46:17,269
Mrs Ward, I have to draw your
attention to an unpleasant fact.

853
00:46:17,361 --> 00:46:20,831
But in our emergency accommodation,
it's not very nice.

854
00:46:20,961 --> 00:46:23,191
Some of the people
are a little rough.

855
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:25,841
Are you sure you want to go in?

856
00:46:25,921 --> 00:46:29,800
Look, I don't wanna be cheeky
but we've been here for six hours.

857
00:46:29,881 --> 00:46:32,349
If I had any choice,
do you think I'd have stayed?

858
00:46:32,441 --> 00:46:35,001
All right. Sit down. Mr Ward, please.

859
00:46:38,601 --> 00:46:42,150
Have you got a bit of chocolate
to keep 'em quiet, please, Cath?

860
00:46:45,081 --> 00:46:48,437
Mr Ward, I'd like to check
one or two facts with you, please.

861
00:46:48,521 --> 00:46:52,594
You and your wife lived at
your mother's house up to what date?

862
00:46:52,681 --> 00:46:54,751
January '62.

863
00:46:54,841 --> 00:46:56,832
And at what address would that be?

864
00:46:56,921 --> 00:46:59,719
97 Maysoul Buildings, Maysoul Street.

865
00:46:59,801 --> 00:47:01,792
Really? Not Mayberry?

866
00:47:01,881 --> 00:47:03,872
No, Maysoul.

867
00:47:05,841 --> 00:47:07,797
Now, Mr Ward.

868
00:47:07,881 --> 00:47:10,839
What is your wife's mother's address?

869
00:47:10,921 --> 00:47:13,037
(Baby cries)

870
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:15,430
- Do you have any sisters?
- No.

871
00:47:15,521 --> 00:47:18,399
- I thought...
- There's my teenage sister.

872
00:47:18,481 --> 00:47:21,154
But she don't count,
she hasn't got a house.

873
00:47:21,241 --> 00:47:24,790
- Grandmother or grandfather?
- One grandfather, he's in a home.

874
00:47:24,881 --> 00:47:30,274
How many rooms does your mother
occupy at Maysoul Road?

875
00:47:30,361 --> 00:47:32,317
One bedroom and a living room.

876
00:47:32,401 --> 00:47:34,676
But there's three adults
living there already.

877
00:47:34,761 --> 00:47:39,391
The accommodation we have available
is for wives only, not husbands.

878
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:42,234
Why can't you accommodate husbands?

879
00:47:42,321 --> 00:47:47,349
We used to house husbands once
but they used to tear up the sheets.

880
00:47:47,441 --> 00:47:49,397
(Children grizzle)

881
00:47:52,921 --> 00:47:56,880
We have no objection to you coming to
see your wife of a weekday evening,

882
00:47:56,961 --> 00:47:58,952
provided you are gone by eight.

883
00:47:59,041 --> 00:48:01,953
The front entrance must not be used
by you homeless.

884
00:48:02,041 --> 00:48:03,997
There's a very good reason for that.

885
00:48:04,081 --> 00:48:06,800
It upsets the old people
we accommodate here,

886
00:48:06,881 --> 00:48:09,554
and this place was meant for them.

887
00:48:09,641 --> 00:48:13,873
No alcohol in the building.
About this we are fairly strict.

888
00:48:13,961 --> 00:48:16,395
And inmates are expected
to take a regular bath

889
00:48:16,481 --> 00:48:18,756
and get as much fresh air
as possible.

890
00:48:18,841 --> 00:48:24,313
Rent is five shillings a night for
each adult and three bob for a child,

891
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:26,357
payable in advance.

892
00:48:26,441 --> 00:48:30,798
There are other rules but you'll find
it easier to pick them up as you go.

893
00:48:30,881 --> 00:48:32,837
Any questions?

894
00:48:32,921 --> 00:48:34,912
I don't think very much of it.

895
00:48:35,001 --> 00:48:38,118
In many places in England,
families are not kept together.

896
00:48:38,201 --> 00:48:42,035
They're broken up when they become
homeless and children put in care.

897
00:48:42,121 --> 00:48:44,681
If we rehoused homeless families,

898
00:48:44,761 --> 00:48:49,232
people would see it was an easy way
to jump the queue, wouldn't they?

899
00:48:49,321 --> 00:48:51,881
And it must be strictly understood

900
00:48:51,961 --> 00:48:54,031
that this accommodation
is only temporary.

901
00:48:54,121 --> 00:48:57,636
After three months, make no mistake,
we turn you out.

902
00:48:57,721 --> 00:48:59,677
So keep searching.

903
00:48:59,761 --> 00:49:02,036
Right, sit down.

904
00:49:03,041 --> 00:49:05,191
(Baby cries)

905
00:49:07,401 --> 00:49:11,030
Well, don't eat it, then,
I'll eat it, give it to me.

906
00:49:18,081 --> 00:49:20,037
Mrs Ward?

907
00:49:21,361 --> 00:49:24,319
You'll be in room E72.

908
00:49:24,401 --> 00:49:26,232
E- seven-two, don't forget it.

909
00:49:30,561 --> 00:49:32,950
Hey, go on, out!

910
00:49:33,041 --> 00:49:35,874
Well, I'm just taking her
up to her room, see?

911
00:49:35,961 --> 00:49:39,636
- We've only just come.
- Oh, I see, you're newcomers.

912
00:49:39,721 --> 00:49:42,189
Well, no men beyond the lodge.

913
00:49:42,281 --> 00:49:46,797
I'm afraid you'll have to get out
and say goodbye to your wife now.

914
00:49:47,601 --> 00:49:50,513
Hey, not you, girl!

915
00:49:50,601 --> 00:49:53,832
Oh, look, she's just arrived,
let me take her up, please.

916
00:49:53,921 --> 00:49:55,877
If he could stay, I'd be all right.

917
00:49:55,961 --> 00:49:59,351
No, no, no, I'm sorry,
I don't make the rules.

918
00:49:59,441 --> 00:50:02,717
He'll have to go. She's got
a lot to get through yet.

919
00:50:02,801 --> 00:50:06,237
- Now, listen, lady, don't be saucy!
- Reg, don't. Shut up.

920
00:50:10,721 --> 00:50:13,281
Goodbye, love.

921
00:50:15,041 --> 00:50:17,430
(Man) Many social workers feel

922
00:50:17,521 --> 00:50:21,230
that all homeless families
are problem families.

923
00:50:21,321 --> 00:50:24,870
They may not be when they arrive
in our hostels,

924
00:50:24,961 --> 00:50:27,316
but they usually are when they leave.

925
00:50:27,401 --> 00:50:31,394
It was thought that if a man couldn't
provide a home for his family,

926
00:50:31,481 --> 00:50:35,235
he wasn't much good,
but that is certainly not true today.

927
00:50:35,321 --> 00:50:39,997
The majority of the homeless families
we deal with are decent citizens,

928
00:50:40,081 --> 00:50:42,914
and all they want
is a home of their own.

929
00:50:43,001 --> 00:50:46,471
Try and keep the children clean
cos there's disease here.

930
00:50:46,561 --> 00:50:48,950
Why do they send us here, then?

931
00:50:49,041 --> 00:50:53,717
There's disease in all these places.
We try to keep it down by swabbing.

932
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:55,280
Do what you have to do, Sean.

933
00:50:55,361 --> 00:50:57,636
Take your panties down

934
00:50:57,721 --> 00:51:00,997
and then they're gonna put something
up your bottie.

935
00:51:01,081 --> 00:51:03,959
Sean always was the worst
at taking his pants down.

936
00:51:04,041 --> 00:51:06,509
He never liked anyone
to see him without them.

937
00:51:06,601 --> 00:51:09,274
(Man)
There exists in local authorities

938
00:51:09,361 --> 00:51:12,433
a kind of punitive attitude,

939
00:51:12,521 --> 00:51:16,480
which means that the whole problem
of homeless families

940
00:51:16,561 --> 00:51:18,950
is the Cinderella of the Cinderellas.

941
00:51:19,041 --> 00:51:22,317
(Older man)
So I came out of the welfare place

942
00:51:22,401 --> 00:51:25,996
and said goodbye to the missus, not
knowing when I should see her again.

943
00:51:26,081 --> 00:51:29,596
Some men don't seem to bother
whether they live with their wives,

944
00:51:29,681 --> 00:51:31,717
but I've always been one.

945
00:51:31,801 --> 00:51:34,873
We've been happy together,
married 18 years

946
00:51:34,961 --> 00:51:39,193
and when you get like that,
it upsets you, it breaks your heart.

947
00:51:39,281 --> 00:51:43,718
(Woman) Bus drivers, lorry drivers,
coalmen, GPO sorters,

948
00:51:43,801 --> 00:51:47,237
general labourers, scaffolders,

949
00:51:47,321 --> 00:51:49,710
all sorts of groups of workers

950
00:51:49,801 --> 00:51:51,996
have become homeless.

951
00:51:52,081 --> 00:51:55,869
Think I'll go and see Dolly,
see if I can get a cup of tea.

952
00:51:55,961 --> 00:51:57,917
I haven't got the sugar.

953
00:51:58,881 --> 00:52:00,394
Doll!

954
00:52:00,481 --> 00:52:03,598
Dolly! Any sugar?

955
00:52:03,681 --> 00:52:06,354
No, not today. Got the milk.

956
00:52:09,281 --> 00:52:11,237
(Chatter)

957
00:52:12,561 --> 00:52:16,236
(Man) Unless we build houses
in the areas where there is work,

958
00:52:16,321 --> 00:52:19,233
or redistribute the work to areas
where there are empty houses,

959
00:52:19,321 --> 00:52:22,472
we're bound to get homeless families.

960
00:52:22,561 --> 00:52:26,520
It is amazing to us there aren't tens
of thousands of homeless families

961
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:28,956
instead of just thousands.

962
00:52:38,441 --> 00:52:40,511
I think you'll be all right in here.

963
00:53:06,761 --> 00:53:08,717
(Whispers) Cathy?

964
00:53:08,801 --> 00:53:10,154
Cathy!

965
00:53:10,241 --> 00:53:12,596
(Whispers)
Reg, what are you doing here?

966
00:53:12,681 --> 00:53:15,115
I climbed in.

967
00:53:15,201 --> 00:53:19,592
I met one of the husbands outside,
he showed me a way through the wall.

968
00:53:23,601 --> 00:53:25,592
I couldn't leave you alone, Cath.

969
00:53:26,521 --> 00:53:28,512
Oh, I'm pleased you've come, Reg.

970
00:53:28,601 --> 00:53:31,479
- I really am.
- Come on.

971
00:53:31,561 --> 00:53:33,631
(Sobs)

972
00:53:44,001 --> 00:53:45,957
(Sighs)

973
00:53:47,001 --> 00:53:49,151
(Cries)

974
00:53:49,241 --> 00:53:51,038
Shh...

975
00:53:52,481 --> 00:53:55,712
Oh, Reg!

976
00:53:55,801 --> 00:53:58,395
(Sobs)

977
00:54:09,041 --> 00:54:10,997
(Reg) Come on.

978
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:13,549
(Cathy) I'm sorry.

979
00:54:13,641 --> 00:54:15,597
I am.

980
00:54:19,921 --> 00:54:21,877
(Loud chatter)

981
00:54:35,681 --> 00:54:37,672
(Woman)
We lived in a rented house in Margate

982
00:54:37,761 --> 00:54:41,470
that was needed
for a road-widening scheme.

983
00:54:41,561 --> 00:54:44,519
So we got an eviction order.
They said they couldn't rehouse us

984
00:54:44,601 --> 00:54:47,479
cos they wasn't the welfare authority
and they had no houses.

985
00:54:47,561 --> 00:54:51,839
- Go and get another cup.
- Why, what's the matter with it?

986
00:54:51,921 --> 00:54:55,470
Keep away from the cracked mugs.
There's sickness in 'em.

987
00:54:55,561 --> 00:54:58,473
My first thought is,
I feel I'm a refugee.

988
00:54:58,561 --> 00:55:02,236
I've lived here all me life,
now I feel like I'm a refugee.

989
00:55:02,321 --> 00:55:05,074
- Send us back to where?
- To where you're from.

990
00:55:05,161 --> 00:55:07,470
But not before you've taken
all our houses away.

991
00:55:07,561 --> 00:55:09,517
Ask the warden and he will explain.

992
00:55:09,601 --> 00:55:12,638
- You lot come with all your kids...
- I'm not going back.

993
00:55:12,721 --> 00:55:15,440
That's why we have to come
to places like this.

994
00:55:15,521 --> 00:55:17,477
I'm not going back.

995
00:55:17,561 --> 00:55:20,598
- Too many of you, there are.
- Doesn't matter.

996
00:55:20,681 --> 00:55:23,036
(Northern Irish woman)
I was in a council house, so I was.

997
00:55:23,121 --> 00:55:26,557
Then my husband buggered off
and they've a scheme there

998
00:55:26,641 --> 00:55:28,791
where abandoned women are turned out.

999
00:55:28,881 --> 00:55:33,591
It's meant to stop men leaving their
wives, but it didn't work in my case.

1000
00:55:33,681 --> 00:55:37,993
(Man) It's nonsense to say coloured
people caused our housing crisis.

1001
00:55:38,081 --> 00:55:41,676
The Millner Holland report showed
that if immigrants didn't come,

1002
00:55:41,761 --> 00:55:44,912
their places would be taken
by domestic migrants

1003
00:55:45,001 --> 00:55:48,232
or many essential jobs
would remain unfilled.

1004
00:55:48,321 --> 00:55:52,997
Secondly, more people leave Britain
each year than come into it.

1005
00:55:53,081 --> 00:55:55,197
Go on, Paulie, back to mummy.

1006
00:55:55,281 --> 00:55:57,237
Go on, be a good boy.

1007
00:55:58,041 --> 00:56:01,113
(Caribbean woman)
Scrubbing, scrubbing, that's all.

1008
00:56:01,201 --> 00:56:03,157
It is all day here.

1009
00:56:03,241 --> 00:56:07,075
We have to scrub the place out
twice a day, you will see.

1010
00:56:09,041 --> 00:56:12,397
The children's the ones
that feels it most.

1011
00:56:12,481 --> 00:56:16,474
They miss the toys they've had
since they were tiny kiddies.

1012
00:56:18,841 --> 00:56:23,631
(Young woman) It's too far to take
them back to their old school.

1013
00:56:23,721 --> 00:56:28,715
What are we meant to do, put 'em in
a new classroom with no preparation?

1014
00:56:28,801 --> 00:56:31,269
- How'd you get that in here?
- Ways and means.

1015
00:56:31,361 --> 00:56:35,115
- Here, give us your cup.
- Yeah, thanks.

1016
00:56:35,201 --> 00:56:37,920
- Want a little drop?
- Steady on, I don't wanna get drunk.

1017
00:56:38,001 --> 00:56:40,879
They come in at night
to see your husband has gone

1018
00:56:40,961 --> 00:56:43,111
and again at one or two
in the morning.

1019
00:56:43,201 --> 00:56:47,479
(Caribbean woman) There's no place
for family life, so they quarrel.

1020
00:56:47,561 --> 00:56:50,029
The women, they get so frustrated.

1021
00:56:50,121 --> 00:56:53,636
We used to have money once,
didn't we? And I had a good job.

1022
00:56:53,721 --> 00:56:58,033
And, well, then I had me accident
and I lost the job, but...

1023
00:56:58,121 --> 00:57:00,760
And we had that house, didn't we?

1024
00:57:00,841 --> 00:57:03,719
And then of course we got evicted.

1025
00:57:03,801 --> 00:57:06,634
But there was the caravan,

1026
00:57:06,721 --> 00:57:09,679
and we got?10 for that.

1027
00:57:09,761 --> 00:57:14,118
And I gave it to that bloke in
the pub for that number 13, but...

1028
00:57:14,921 --> 00:57:18,834
You know, every time
we just seem to lose on the deal.

1029
00:57:18,921 --> 00:57:21,355
I just don't understand it.

1030
00:57:21,441 --> 00:57:24,001
And here we are, right at the bottom.

1031
00:57:24,081 --> 00:57:27,073
I just don't understand.

1032
00:57:27,161 --> 00:57:30,676
As time goes on, we just seem
to sort of get lower, don't we?

1033
00:57:30,761 --> 00:57:33,321
We're down now but we'll be up again.

1034
00:57:33,401 --> 00:57:38,316
Oh, yeah, we'll get up again,
no question about that, no.

1035
00:57:38,401 --> 00:57:40,357
You know, it's funny, but...

1036
00:57:40,441 --> 00:57:43,831
.. now I'm on my own,
I just don't seem to tick over.

1037
00:57:43,921 --> 00:57:49,632
I mean, when I got married, you know,
with my wife and with the children,

1038
00:57:49,721 --> 00:57:53,077
I got to sort of need you
and the kids.

1039
00:57:53,161 --> 00:57:56,836
And we could tick over
and everything was fine.

1040
00:57:58,041 --> 00:58:00,157
It's very funny, but...

1041
00:58:00,241 --> 00:58:04,075
.. now I'm on me own again,
it's all gone wrong.

1042
00:58:04,441 --> 00:58:07,080
- Mrs Ward, I need a favour.
- Oh, yeah?

1043
00:58:07,161 --> 00:58:09,117
It's about Sean.

1044
00:58:09,201 --> 00:58:11,157
I've come to a decision.

1045
00:58:11,241 --> 00:58:14,711
I've decided I can't bear to see him
in that place any more.

1046
00:58:14,801 --> 00:58:17,235
I mean, he's pining, I can see it.

1047
00:58:17,321 --> 00:58:20,597
So, what I was wondering,
if it's all right with you,

1048
00:58:20,681 --> 00:58:22,956
could I leave him for a few days?

1049
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:24,997
Leave him here? What d'you mean?

1050
00:58:25,081 --> 00:58:28,232
You can't walk out on your children
just like that.

1051
00:58:28,321 --> 00:58:32,075
Leave Sean with me? You must be
out of your bleedin' mind!

1052
00:58:32,921 --> 00:58:35,833
(Sniffs) You don't understand.

1053
00:58:35,921 --> 00:58:38,196
I don't want to leave him.

1054
00:58:38,561 --> 00:58:41,121
I mean, he really gets me.

1055
00:58:41,201 --> 00:58:43,192
(Sobs)

1056
00:58:44,481 --> 00:58:48,520
I can't stand to see him
taking it so badly.

1057
00:58:48,601 --> 00:58:50,910
I can't stand it!

1058
00:58:54,761 --> 00:58:57,878
Bye-bye, darling, be a good boy.

1059
00:58:59,761 --> 00:59:01,717
Bye.

1060
00:59:17,241 --> 00:59:20,597
I've told you before about using
my bloody basin, haven't I?

1061
00:59:20,681 --> 00:59:24,071
- Oh, shut up!
- My kids have to wash in there.

1062
00:59:24,161 --> 00:59:27,437
Your bleedin' kids walk round
with their behinds hanging out!

1063
00:59:27,521 --> 00:59:29,591
Sit down, Reg, you look uneasy.

1064
00:59:29,681 --> 00:59:32,241
Well, sit down, then!

1065
00:59:32,321 --> 00:59:35,597
All right, I'm sorry,
I am uneasy, that's all.

1066
00:59:35,681 --> 00:59:39,071
Well, what about me?
I have to live in this place.

1067
00:59:41,681 --> 00:59:44,639
Reg, I don't like to ask you this.

1068
00:59:46,801 --> 00:59:48,917
But Stevie needs some new shoes.

1069
00:59:49,001 --> 00:59:53,074
Cath, I'm only getting?11 a week
and I'm giving you six of it.

1070
00:59:53,161 --> 00:59:56,915
I mean, there's 15 bob
for national insurance,

1071
00:59:57,001 --> 00:59:59,196
?1 for that furniture
we got in store.

1072
00:59:59,281 --> 01:00:03,035
- Well, that leaves you?35s.
- There's?210s for me lodgings.

1073
01:00:03,121 --> 01:00:05,510
Come on, Stevie,
go and play with the kids.

1074
01:00:05,601 --> 01:00:08,877
?210s for my lodgings,
I got ten bob a week on travelling,

1075
01:00:08,961 --> 01:00:11,395
leaving five bob
for clothes and food.

1076
01:00:11,481 --> 01:00:13,517
How can I clothe meself
on five bob a week?

1077
01:00:13,601 --> 01:00:16,638
- What meals d'you get at your digs?
- Only my breakfast.

1078
01:00:16,721 --> 01:00:19,155
- Well, how d'you manage, then?
- Well, I don't.

1079
01:00:19,241 --> 01:00:21,471
I was gonna ask if you couldn't do
on a bit less.

1080
01:00:21,561 --> 01:00:25,474
- Reg, that's not possible.
- How much rent you paying here?

1081
01:00:25,561 --> 01:00:29,110
Five bob a day for a grown-up,
three bob a day for a child.

1082
01:00:29,201 --> 01:00:32,716
- That's?3 a week without Sean.
- What do you do with the rest of it?

1083
01:00:32,801 --> 01:00:36,237
Oh, Reg, we have to get out of here.
We spend it on food.

1084
01:00:36,321 --> 01:00:39,996
- You get meals here, don't you?
- Yes, but there's disease here.

1085
01:00:40,081 --> 01:00:43,153
- I can't let 'em eat here.
- Well, you're gonna have to.

1086
01:00:43,241 --> 01:00:45,835
- Why?
- They'll starve otherwise.

1087
01:00:45,921 --> 01:00:47,912
(Cries)

1088
01:00:49,281 --> 01:00:52,114
I bumped into this fella who said
he knew a bloke who could help us.

1089
01:00:52,201 --> 01:00:56,558
So I went down to see this bloke
and he filled in all these forms.

1090
01:00:56,641 --> 01:00:59,314
And he says to me "Where you living?"

1091
01:00:59,401 --> 01:01:03,838
So I told him this address
of this new lodgings I've moved to.

1092
01:01:03,921 --> 01:01:06,037
And he said "I'm very sorry,

1093
01:01:06,121 --> 01:01:09,511
but I can only help people
that are resident in this borough. "

1094
01:01:18,481 --> 01:01:20,233
I've failed you, Cathy.

1095
01:01:20,641 --> 01:01:22,552
You've been here three months.

1096
01:01:22,641 --> 01:01:27,317
This is the maximum period we allow
homeless families to remain here.

1097
01:01:27,401 --> 01:01:30,552
- I understand all that.
- This is only temporary, you know.

1098
01:01:30,641 --> 01:01:33,030
We do have the power to evict you.

1099
01:01:33,121 --> 01:01:36,750
We can quite easily say
"That's enough, so much for her,"

1100
01:01:36,841 --> 01:01:39,639
as they still do in many towns
in Britain.

1101
01:01:39,721 --> 01:01:43,475
We could take your children into care
and turn you out just like that.

1102
01:01:43,561 --> 01:01:46,121
- Please don't.
- But we're not going to.

1103
01:01:46,201 --> 01:01:48,157
We're giving you one more chance.

1104
01:01:48,241 --> 01:01:51,836
But I must emphasise
this is your last chance.

1105
01:01:51,921 --> 01:01:54,276
You must make your own arrangements.

1106
01:01:54,361 --> 01:01:59,116
We've arranged for you to go to what
we call our part-three accommodation.

1107
01:01:59,201 --> 01:02:04,434
This, like the place here, is
somewhere husbands are not admitted.

1108
01:02:04,521 --> 01:02:07,035
But you're not going to like it.

1109
01:02:07,121 --> 01:02:11,751
The amenities are not as good
as here, but it's the best we can do.

1110
01:02:11,841 --> 01:02:13,991
But the thing is, sir,

1111
01:02:14,081 --> 01:02:17,437
couldn't you find me a place
where I could be with my husband?

1112
01:02:17,521 --> 01:02:21,196
Some families here have really been
trying to get back on their feet.

1113
01:02:21,281 --> 01:02:24,796
Well, who are they, and how?
I've not met any.

1114
01:02:24,881 --> 01:02:29,272
I mean, it's not possible. They can
smell you're from this place.

1115
01:02:29,361 --> 01:02:31,352
Don't talk like that, Mrs Ward.

1116
01:02:31,441 --> 01:02:34,956
I'm sorry. But something's
happening to me.

1117
01:02:35,041 --> 01:02:37,475
I don't know how to explain it.

1118
01:02:37,561 --> 01:02:41,315
But all this is having a bad
influence on my family life.

1119
01:02:42,001 --> 01:02:45,960
Somebody told me you've got
these places they call halfway house.

1120
01:02:46,041 --> 01:02:49,397
And I thought if I could get into
one of these places,

1121
01:02:49,481 --> 01:02:51,472
Reg might come back to me.

1122
01:02:51,561 --> 01:02:54,792
You see, he's drifting away from me.

1123
01:02:54,881 --> 01:02:57,520
And the children, they need him.

1124
01:02:57,601 --> 01:03:01,833
And the other thing is, in a month's
time, we've got a place to go to.

1125
01:03:01,921 --> 01:03:04,310
You've got a place in a month's time?

1126
01:03:04,401 --> 01:03:07,120
Yes, on the new Smithson estate.

1127
01:03:07,201 --> 01:03:09,192
They're giving us a new flat there.

1128
01:03:09,281 --> 01:03:12,432
We're told you lost your place
long ago due to moving.

1129
01:03:12,521 --> 01:03:14,477
500 families have moved in already.

1130
01:03:14,561 --> 01:03:16,836
But we was meant to be one of them!

1131
01:03:16,921 --> 01:03:18,957
(Whispering)

1132
01:03:20,881 --> 01:03:23,953
Runts! I saw you laughing!

1133
01:03:24,041 --> 01:03:26,760
Wipe that smile off your face!

1134
01:03:26,841 --> 01:03:29,958
Haven't you got to grant me
one of your houses?

1135
01:03:30,601 --> 01:03:33,991
Haven't you got flats
empty half the night?

1136
01:03:34,841 --> 01:03:36,797
You don't care.

1137
01:03:36,881 --> 01:03:39,349
You only pretend to care!

1138
01:03:39,881 --> 01:03:42,395
Oh, I'm sorry. (Sobs)

1139
01:03:42,481 --> 01:03:43,630
All right.

1140
01:03:43,721 --> 01:03:46,110
All right, all right, Mrs Ward.

1141
01:03:46,201 --> 01:03:48,157
(Sobs)

1142
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:50,675
That will be all.

1143
01:03:50,761 --> 01:03:53,070
(Continues sobbing)

1144
01:03:54,681 --> 01:03:56,672
Oh...

1145
01:04:02,441 --> 01:04:05,911
Well, what's your opinion, Warden?

1146
01:04:06,001 --> 01:04:09,437
Well, she's not an easy person
by a long chalk.

1147
01:04:09,521 --> 01:04:13,878
She keeps the children tidy, but as
you can see, she's not co-operative.

1148
01:04:13,961 --> 01:04:17,112
But in my opinion the trouble rests
with the other half.

1149
01:04:17,201 --> 01:04:21,911
But couldn't we fit her in somewhere
she could be with her husband?

1150
01:04:22,001 --> 01:04:24,435
There's no way,
we're full up as it is.

1151
01:04:24,521 --> 01:04:28,514
We're at the stage where if we had
two other families come in tonight,

1152
01:04:28,601 --> 01:04:32,037
we'd have to evict
to make room for them.

1153
01:04:34,361 --> 01:04:36,317
(Loud chatter)

1154
01:04:36,841 --> 01:04:38,911
(Woman) Sit still!

1155
01:04:59,081 --> 01:05:01,276
Stephen and Mylene live here now.

1156
01:05:01,361 --> 01:05:05,559
(Woman) Six years I've put up
with this, six years I've been here.

1157
01:05:05,641 --> 01:05:09,111
(Young woman) When I come here they
said "Who told you to come here?"

1158
01:05:09,201 --> 01:05:11,157
I said "No-one told me, did they?"

1159
01:05:11,241 --> 01:05:13,277
"I grew up here. "

1160
01:05:13,361 --> 01:05:17,274
(Older woman) My old man was
in the Army for six years, a regular.

1161
01:05:17,361 --> 01:05:19,113
Well, that don't seem to count.

1162
01:05:19,201 --> 01:05:21,157
Don't cry, love, what's the matter?

1163
01:05:21,241 --> 01:05:24,597
- You should leave her alone.
- Why's she crying?

1164
01:05:24,681 --> 01:05:26,956
- She got the letter.
- What letter?

1165
01:05:27,041 --> 01:05:30,113
The letter that evicts you.
They took her kids away.

1166
01:05:30,201 --> 01:05:33,034
(Woman) I went in front of
the committee and they said.:

1167
01:05:33,121 --> 01:05:36,557
"Put your two eldest in institutions,
then we can rehouse you. "

1168
01:05:36,641 --> 01:05:41,237
Can I give you a tip? Don't take
a bath cos there's tramps get in it.

1169
01:05:41,321 --> 01:05:42,879
And the toilets get blocked.

1170
01:05:42,961 --> 01:05:47,751
There are cockroaches behind
the plumbing about an inch long.

1171
01:05:47,841 --> 01:05:52,835
This little girl and boy had a lovely
garden in their house by the seaside.

1172
01:05:52,921 --> 01:05:55,515
Can I have a garden?

1173
01:05:55,601 --> 01:05:57,557
(Woman) I was bombed out in Plymouth.

1174
01:05:57,641 --> 01:05:59,996
Then it was two years
in a mental home.

1175
01:06:00,081 --> 01:06:02,117
I'm not to blame for that, am I?

1176
01:06:02,201 --> 01:06:06,433
(Woman) I didn't feel I could
do that, say goodbye to the kiddies.

1177
01:06:06,521 --> 01:06:09,911
It's not... you know, you find
you can't carry on without them.

1178
01:06:10,001 --> 01:06:13,038
(Young woman)
Last June it was I lost him.

1179
01:06:13,121 --> 01:06:17,034
A disease, it was.
He was only ten weeks old.

1180
01:06:17,121 --> 01:06:19,077
Poor little soul.

1181
01:06:19,161 --> 01:06:24,235
(Caribbean woman) They say "Go and
look for houses, " but it's nonsense.

1182
01:06:24,321 --> 01:06:27,677
They call us the cubies
because we live in cubicles.

1183
01:06:27,761 --> 01:06:30,992
Everybody round here thinks
we're either unmarried mothers

1184
01:06:31,081 --> 01:06:34,198
or girls from borstal,
but that's not so.

1185
01:06:34,281 --> 01:06:37,717
My children were ill
and my husband hadn't seen them.

1186
01:06:37,801 --> 01:06:40,361
So he asked, could he come up
and see them?

1187
01:06:40,441 --> 01:06:42,432
They said no.

1188
01:06:42,521 --> 01:06:44,477
So he tried to force his way in.

1189
01:06:44,561 --> 01:06:49,157
They soon called the police and shut
him out. The police laughed at him.

1190
01:06:49,241 --> 01:06:53,439
(Woman) Even if we did find houses,
there'd be other people here.

1191
01:06:53,521 --> 01:06:55,716
(Young woman)
It's silly when a girl gets married,

1192
01:06:55,801 --> 01:06:57,792
thinking a bloke'll stay faithful.

1193
01:06:57,881 --> 01:07:01,635
But I still say I'm better off being
married to him than without him.

1194
01:07:01,721 --> 01:07:03,791
If you love him,
what's the point in leaving him?

1195
01:07:03,881 --> 01:07:07,999
(Woman) We have to be back home
by eight and in bed by ten.

1196
01:07:08,081 --> 01:07:10,037
(Older woman)
He's got a fancy girl now.

1197
01:07:10,121 --> 01:07:13,193
You see, men don't have it
like women.

1198
01:07:13,281 --> 01:07:15,749
He's got his freedom, ain't he?

1199
01:07:17,361 --> 01:07:20,797
- What do you do all day, then, Cath?
- What d'you think I do?

1200
01:07:20,881 --> 01:07:22,872
There's nothing to do.

1201
01:07:22,961 --> 01:07:24,917
Just sit about all day.

1202
01:07:25,401 --> 01:07:27,551
Feel like running away.

1203
01:07:30,081 --> 01:07:32,276
What about the kids, then?

1204
01:07:32,601 --> 01:07:34,637
They're restless.

1205
01:07:34,721 --> 01:07:38,350
Had so many changes, they don't know
what's gonna happen next.

1206
01:07:38,441 --> 01:07:40,397
It's not good.

1207
01:07:41,401 --> 01:07:45,155
If you go out at night, you've got to
be back by nine o'clock.

1208
01:07:47,041 --> 01:07:49,032
How you getting on with the food?

1209
01:07:49,121 --> 01:07:51,760
- There's potatoes.
- Yeah.

1210
01:07:52,801 --> 01:07:55,235
Kids woke me up last night.

1211
01:07:56,241 --> 01:07:59,358
They were crying
cos they were hungry.

1212
01:07:59,441 --> 01:08:02,638
I wish you could come
more often, Reg.

1213
01:08:02,721 --> 01:08:04,677
Can't afford to, Cathy.

1214
01:08:04,761 --> 01:08:09,039
D'you know, I really long
for the nights here sometimes.

1215
01:08:09,121 --> 01:08:11,760
- Yeah, I bet you do.
- But not like we used to.

1216
01:08:11,841 --> 01:08:16,517
Reg, till all this happened,
it was a happy marriage, wasn't it?

1217
01:08:16,601 --> 01:08:20,150
Oh, yeah. If it weren't for the kids,
we wouldn't be here.

1218
01:08:20,241 --> 01:08:23,551
Still, I'm glad we had 'em. You can't
wish your kids away, can you?

1219
01:08:23,641 --> 01:08:25,597
Oh, no.

1220
01:08:25,681 --> 01:08:28,593
But, I don't know, I wish we could
start all over again.

1221
01:08:28,681 --> 01:08:32,356
- I'd choose the same.
- Oh, I'd choose you, Reg.

1222
01:08:32,441 --> 01:08:34,716
But now, I don't know.

1223
01:08:34,801 --> 01:08:37,474
I just feel I want to look away.

1224
01:08:38,201 --> 01:08:41,876
I'm practising very hard
and with a little bit of recognition,

1225
01:08:41,961 --> 01:08:45,237
I should be all right,
earn some money, I hope.

1226
01:08:45,321 --> 01:08:49,075
I know me age is against me,
but I'm hoping to win.

1227
01:08:49,161 --> 01:08:52,597
- Give us a song, then, come on.
- All right, then.

1228
01:08:52,681 --> 01:08:54,751
(Taps soundboard)

1229
01:08:54,841 --> 01:08:58,629
(Cathy) It went through my mind
to chuck the whole thing up,

1230
01:08:58,721 --> 01:09:01,076
turn my back on the kids and go off.

1231
01:09:01,481 --> 01:09:03,870
You see, I felt I'd failed them.

1232
01:09:03,961 --> 01:09:07,636
Well, I knew they weren't fit
to be in a place like that.

1233
01:09:07,721 --> 01:09:10,599
I thought how I used to be
before we were married,

1234
01:09:10,681 --> 01:09:12,751
without anyone depending on me,

1235
01:09:12,841 --> 01:09:17,915
and I had boyfriends, and money
in my pockets and some good times.

1236
01:09:18,001 --> 01:09:21,994
Look, why don't you go, Reg?
I mean, you need a job, love.

1237
01:09:22,081 --> 01:09:24,197
I've heard there's jobs in Liverpool.

1238
01:09:24,281 --> 01:09:27,432
Then when you've got a job,
you can find a place.

1239
01:09:27,521 --> 01:09:30,240
- That's what I thought, Cath.
- They say it's easier up there.

1240
01:09:30,321 --> 01:09:34,439
- I'm bound to get a place up there.
- Yeah.

1241
01:09:34,521 --> 01:09:39,197
And then when the Smithson estate's
finished, we'll have no more worries.

1242
01:09:39,281 --> 01:09:40,350
Yeah.

1243
01:09:40,441 --> 01:09:44,593
If I can't get a place, I'll be back
by the time the other one's finished.

1244
01:09:44,681 --> 01:09:47,479
It was all so strange, really.

1245
01:09:47,561 --> 01:09:52,032
Cos kids do seem... Well, they do
seem to sort of need their dad.

1246
01:09:52,121 --> 01:09:56,160
They look forward to being
with their dad as well as their mum.

1247
01:09:57,041 --> 01:09:58,997
To have a bit of a laugh with him.

1248
01:09:59,081 --> 01:10:01,515
That baby was in tiptop
medical condition.

1249
01:10:01,601 --> 01:10:04,911
Yeah? If it was,
how come it's dead now?

1250
01:10:05,001 --> 01:10:09,438
The mother must have been to blame.
She didn't look after it properly.

1251
01:10:09,521 --> 01:10:13,594
- She's a marvellous mother!
- I'm only stating the truth!

1252
01:10:13,681 --> 01:10:17,993
Hm! The way some of you women
keep your children...

1253
01:10:18,081 --> 01:10:21,551
What do you mean?
What chance have we got in this dump?

1254
01:10:21,641 --> 01:10:24,997
Just a minute. What about hygiene?
What about bathing?

1255
01:10:25,081 --> 01:10:28,357
How often do you change
your baby's nappy?

1256
01:10:28,441 --> 01:10:31,194
- Three times a day!
- You cow!

1257
01:10:31,281 --> 01:10:33,670
You bloody cow!

1258
01:10:33,761 --> 01:10:37,913
- Come here, my dear!
- You don't care! Look at you!

1259
01:10:38,001 --> 01:10:42,472
- You'll be sorry for this, my dear!
- We're bloody clean! Aren't we?

1260
01:10:42,561 --> 01:10:45,075
- (All) Yes!
- We keep our kids clean!

1261
01:10:45,161 --> 01:10:48,471
- Clean, you don't know what...
- (Baby cries)

1262
01:10:48,561 --> 01:10:50,756
Oh, nice carrying on!

1263
01:10:50,841 --> 01:10:53,674
Look, making the babies cry!

1264
01:10:53,761 --> 01:10:56,753
You cow! You're a cow, you are!

1265
01:10:56,841 --> 01:10:59,309
She couldn't care about us,
could she?

1266
01:10:59,401 --> 01:11:04,395
- Look at this bloody dump we're in!
- Yes, and it shouldn't be a dump!

1267
01:11:04,481 --> 01:11:07,518
- It's your fault.
- My fault?

1268
01:11:08,161 --> 01:11:10,721
You were the one that bought it back.

1269
01:11:10,801 --> 01:11:13,679
- Where's my cap?
- I don't know.

1270
01:11:13,761 --> 01:11:16,229
Go on, get out. Go on.

1271
01:11:16,321 --> 01:11:20,234
- I shall be reporting you.
- You do that! You do it! Bugger off!

1272
01:11:21,241 --> 01:11:24,278
I wonder who said this.
It's about this place.

1273
01:11:24,361 --> 01:11:26,477
I wonder who told those lies.

1274
01:11:26,561 --> 01:11:28,552
(Cathy) It wasn't me.

1275
01:11:28,641 --> 01:11:31,235
Listen, young lady,
I'm not as stupid as I may look.

1276
01:11:31,321 --> 01:11:34,677
It was a blonde who talked
to the reporter. A blonde like you.

1277
01:11:34,761 --> 01:11:36,752
Well, I don't know who it was!

1278
01:11:36,841 --> 01:11:40,117
We've had other reports
about you too, I think.

1279
01:11:40,201 --> 01:11:42,396
About Mrs Selby?

1280
01:11:42,481 --> 01:11:46,872
I was just telling her about the poor
little baby that died, that's all.

1281
01:11:48,881 --> 01:11:51,076
Mrs Ward,

1282
01:11:51,161 --> 01:11:54,551
I see that your husband
hasn't been paying the fees.

1283
01:11:54,641 --> 01:11:57,439
Paying the fees? Course he is!

1284
01:11:57,521 --> 01:11:59,512
(Man) We'd know if he was or wasn't.

1285
01:11:59,601 --> 01:12:01,990
Didn't he tell you he wasn't paying?

1286
01:12:03,761 --> 01:12:06,878
Well, I haven't seen him.
He's been away on business.

1287
01:12:06,961 --> 01:12:10,237
- You haven't seen him?
- Not for a while.

1288
01:12:10,321 --> 01:12:13,836
Look, my girl, what is going on here?
Are you married, or aren't you?

1289
01:12:13,921 --> 01:12:16,116
Oh, shut up, you! Shut up!

1290
01:12:28,161 --> 01:12:30,595
"It must be clearly understood

1291
01:12:30,681 --> 01:12:34,435
that the temporary accommodation will
not be available after that date. "

1292
01:12:34,521 --> 01:12:36,477
What does it mean?

1293
01:12:36,561 --> 01:12:39,837
- I shouldn't worry about it.
- Doesn't mean what it says, maybe.

1294
01:12:39,921 --> 01:12:43,914
(Woman) These people are casualties
of the welfare state.

1295
01:12:44,001 --> 01:12:47,960
They're pushed around like so much
human litter and nobody'll help them.

1296
01:12:48,041 --> 01:12:52,592
(Man) Originally, homelessness was
regarded as a passing postwar phase.

1297
01:12:52,681 --> 01:12:57,357
But the problem now appears to be
with us for the foreseeable future.

1298
01:12:57,441 --> 01:13:01,070
Oh, excuse me, I called about a room.

1299
01:13:01,161 --> 01:13:04,517
- How many of you?
- Just me and me two kiddies.

1300
01:13:04,601 --> 01:13:06,592
Sorry, I don't take children.

1301
01:13:06,681 --> 01:13:09,036
Don't be a fathead
when your time comes.

1302
01:13:09,121 --> 01:13:11,112
Don't be like Mrs Growcott.

1303
01:13:11,201 --> 01:13:13,237
Let's take 'em away without any fuss.

1304
01:13:13,321 --> 01:13:16,836
What right have you got
to take my kids from me?

1305
01:13:16,921 --> 01:13:20,436
Well, you can't find a place
for them, can you?

1306
01:13:20,521 --> 01:13:24,480
Now look, you've had your chance.
We're not interested in you now.

1307
01:13:24,561 --> 01:13:28,520
It's the kids we're worried about.
We can't have them sleeping out.

1308
01:13:28,601 --> 01:13:31,957
After they leave here
they'll need care and protection.

1309
01:13:32,041 --> 01:13:35,158
Come on, Stevie, help Mummy pack up.

1310
01:13:36,121 --> 01:13:38,112
They're too heavy.

1311
01:13:38,241 --> 01:13:40,709
That's a good boy.

1312
01:13:43,361 --> 01:13:45,397
You coming out with me in a minute?

1313
01:13:48,361 --> 01:13:50,431
(Station bell rings)

1314
01:13:56,961 --> 01:13:58,997
(Whistle)

1315
01:14:05,841 --> 01:14:07,752
(Bell rings)

1316
01:14:07,841 --> 01:14:10,799
(Cathy) We had a bite to eat
from the cafeteria.

1317
01:14:11,001 --> 01:14:14,198
Course, the kiddies didn't know
what was gonna happen.

1318
01:14:14,281 --> 01:14:16,237
But I knew they'd catch up with us.

1319
01:14:16,441 --> 01:14:18,796
Wherever we tried to bed down
for the night.

1320
01:14:25,801 --> 01:14:29,271
You're not having my kids!
You're not having 'em!

1321
01:14:29,761 --> 01:14:31,479
(Shrieks) Stop it!

1322
01:14:31,561 --> 01:14:33,279
(Baby cries)

1323
01:14:33,361 --> 01:14:35,317
Get off!

1324
01:14:36,201 --> 01:14:38,590
Give me them back!

1325
01:14:38,681 --> 01:14:40,672
(Baby cries)

1326
01:14:42,761 --> 01:14:45,036
(Stephen cries)

1327
01:14:57,881 --> 01:14:59,473
(Bell rings)

1328
01:16:33,921 --> 01:16:37,709
# But I'm five

1329
01:16:37,801 --> 01:16:41,714
# Hundred miles away

1330
01:16:41,801 --> 01:16:45,316
# From home #

1331
01:16:45,401 --> 01:16:48,473
