1
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,200
The Road To Reality.

2
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,960
Don't wanna be going there.

3
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,880
Hiya.

4
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,000
An oasis of calm in here, mad out there.

5
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,960
Gorgeous day for it, though, innit?

6
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,760
Never been in here before.

7
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,600
I like your hat.

8
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,720
Busy?

9
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,320
Hello?

10
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,120
Having a bad day?

11
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,440
No.

12
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,680
Oh. Not till I showed up, eh?

13
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,840
Look like a rabbit caught in the headlights.

14
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,240
<i>I won't bite.</i>

15
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,960
Don't worry, I'm going now.

16
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,400
Have a good day. Stay happy.

17
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,600
I ain't nicked nothing. Honest, guv'nor.

18
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,560
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

19
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,600
Oh, no, no, come on.

20
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,720
That's just brilliant, that is.

21
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,120
Oh, no, I didn't even get a chance
to say goodbye.

22
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:36,880
<i># You'll never get it right
cos when you're laid in bed at night</i>

23
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,080
<i># Watching... roaches climb the wall</i>

24
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,160
<i># If you called your dad he could stop it all</i>

25
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,600
<i># You'll never live like common people</i>

26
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,760
<i># You'll never do what common people do</i>

27
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,440
<i># You'll never fail like common people</i>

28
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,720
<i># You'll never watch your life slide out of view</i>

29
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,160
<i># And dance and drink and screw</i>

30
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,120
<i># Because there's nothing else to do</i>

31
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,920
The music's stopped.

32
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,360
It stopped ages ago.

33
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,880
Yeah, I was just enjoying the silence.

34
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,360
<i>What?</i>

35
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,080
What's so funny?

36
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,880
I don't know!

37
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,880
Can you just...

38
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,640
Oh, your sister's woken up, Poppy.

39
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,800
<i>Suzy, what's that?</i>

40
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,960
<i>What is it? Is that your latest conquest?</i>

41
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,640
Oh, bless him!

42
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,440
Don't you ever pray that you're adopted, Suzy?

43
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,720
Oh, argh!

44
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,680
Yeah.

45
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,760
You got me, Zoe.

46
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,960
- Ssssh!
- Who are you shushing?

47
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,080
No, no, no, no, no, no.

48
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:16,880
She's right. Let's all enjoy the silence together.

49
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:21,320
Dawn, will you shut up?
Because no-one else can get a word in.

50
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,120
<i>Ssssssh!</i>

51
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,600
Sorry!

52
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,360
- Sssssh.
- Fingers on lips.

53
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,040
Fingers on the tits.

54
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,120
- Fingers on tits.
- Fingers on the hips.

55
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,040
Can I borrow yours?

56
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,160
- Fingers on the tits.
- Oh, that is properly disgusting.

57
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,120
Chicken fillets. Lunch, anyone?

58
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,960
<i>- Oh, hello!
- Can I have a go?</i>

59
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,320
Of course you can, Dawn, you don't need to ask.

60
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,080
- Anyone over there?
- Oh, I know where that's been.

61
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,840
You have gone down in my estimation.

62
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,680
I'm sorry, Alice.

63
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,040
- I don't get why you wear them, Poppy.
- Oh, don't you?

64
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,320
I mean, you just put them in your bra...

65
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,240
Yeah?

66
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,080
I like the way they make me feel, Suzy.

67
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,560
<i>- Like a natural woman.
- That's right.</i>

68
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,000
- I think it's in the wrong place.
- Ah, whoop!

69
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,720
Oh, look, you've got three tits!

70
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,680
She's like you, Zoe.

71
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,520
<i>- No, that's three nipples.
- Oh, right.</i>

72
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,040
Have you got three nipples?

73
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,280
She doesn't like to talk about it.
I'm going to give her a little hug.

74
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,840
- Over you go.
- Oh, that's quite nice. Do that again.

75
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,800
Oh, really? Oh!

76
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,720
Ooh!

77
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,320
Your cleavage looks great from up here.

78
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,280
- Thank you.
- I've got a bird's eye view.

79
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,320
Come on, ladies, cop a load of this.

80
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,120
Oh, yeah, roll up, roll up.

81
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,600
Look at that!

82
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,120
- It's good, isn't it?
- They're amazing.

83
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,000
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

84
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,600
I think we know where Poppy's sleeping tonight.

85
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,440
Morning.

86
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,400
Time to get up, sleepyhead.

87
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,680
Cup of tea here.

88
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,080
Come on. You can do it.

89
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,320
That's it. That's it, nearly there.

90
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,560
Oh, here we go.

91
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,480
- And she's up! Hey.
- Thanks.

92
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,000
You all right?

93
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,240
Yeah, I slept good.

94
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,360
I heard you.

95
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,160
You always start that.

96
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,160
- I don't snore.
- I know. You never have.

97
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,840
- I don't.
- I don't.

98
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,960
- Are they still asleep?
- No, they buggered off ages ago.

99
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,120
- Did they?
- Yeah.

100
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,280
Oh, right.

101
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,960
- What's the time?
- About 10 past 12.

102
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,600
- They've got a bit of work to do.
- Have they?

103
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,160
- Dawn's late with her dissertation.
- Oh, no. When are your exams?

104
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,160
- Three weeks tomorrow.
- You'll be all right.

105
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,480
Yeah. I'm totally chilled out about it.

106
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,880
Of course you are.

107
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,840
- I'm cool.
- Yeah.

108
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,680
I'm just really stressed.

109
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,880
What? Like an Eskimo with a headache?

110
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,280
<i>- Does anyone want any toast?
- Yeah.</i>

111
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,480
- Yes, please.
- With marmalade, two slices.

112
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,960
Yeah, I know, cut on the diagonal.

113
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,680
- Yeah.
- No crusts.

114
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,720
<i>- Got it. Oh, do you know what?
- What?</i>

115
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,760
- Oh, yeah.
- She's gone.

116
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,240
The thing is, we're starting with criminal justice.

117
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,600
- Is that your first exam?
- Yeah, it's crap.

118
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:42,120
If we had cyber crime first,
or, like, crime and pleasure,

119
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,440
I could ease myself into it.

120
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,720
- No probs.
- Oh, you'll be all right, Suzy.

121
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,480
Yeah, if we can get a degree, any idiot can.

122
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,400
- You calling your sister an idiot?
- Calling you an idiot.

123
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,720
Thank you.

124
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,880
"Crime and pleasure", now that sounds good.

125
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,880
- Sounds like last night.
- Yeah.

126
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,760
You'll be all right.

127
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,880
Yeah.

128
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,680
- See you later.
- Alligator.

129
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,280
- When are we going to see Helen?
- Yeah, when's the baby due?

130
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,160
Don't know, soon. She's been texting me.

131
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,400
- Me too, she's getting worse.
- I know, bless her.

132
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,960
- Want to wait till after your exams?
- I want to get it over with.

133
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,680
All right. Don't worry, leave her to me.

134
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,000
- Text me, yeah?
- Work hard.

135
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,480
Suze... you know it's that way, don't you?

136
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,440
Oh, yeah.

137
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,000
- These make good legs?
- Great.

138
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,960
# I'm so excited...

139
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,480
- It would be amazing to fly, wouldn't it?
- You reckon?

140
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,440
Just... whoosh!

141
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,040
- What? Like Mr Vertigo?
- Oh, yeah. I love that book.

142
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,440
- Yeah.
- Oh, vultures.

143
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,080
- Met a few of them.
- These could be useful.

144
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,840
Oh, yeah, they're great.
Oh, look at him, he's gorgeous.

145
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,680
We could do an owl, they've got big heads.

146
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,120
Good idea. He's got your eyes, look.

147
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,280
- Cheers, Poppy.
- No, they're lovely.

148
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,640
Do penguins emigrate?

149
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,720
What? Do they move to the Costa del Sol?

150
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,440
Emigrate, migrate, whatever.

151
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,160
- What about parrots?
- Oh, yeah, definitely.

152
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,080
<i>- Or a toucan. Oh, look at his beak.
- They're good colours.</i>

153
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,040
Beautiful.

154
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,520
So, are you going to get another bike?

155
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:01,040
Oh, no, I couldn't replace my old lovely.
It's flown the nest now.

156
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,000
Definitely going to learn to drive, though.

157
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,560
- Going to book lessons?
- Might do.

158
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,360
Might not.

159
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,280
I told you, you're not learning to drive in my car.

160
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,200
Nutter.

161
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,120
- Chickens, we could do chickens.
- Chickens don't fly.

162
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,400
<i>Lazy buggers.
What are we going to make, then?</i>

163
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,040
- I don't know. What do you think?
- I don't know.

164
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,040
- Where are they?
- Here.

165
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,960
- That far apart, are they?
- Yeah. Don't poke me.

166
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,920
Wasn't going near you.

167
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,200
- Go on, then.
- Great.

168
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,560
You should ask an adult to help you.

169
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,520
I don't know any.

170
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,320
- I think they're quite good.
- Yeah, what do you reckon?

171
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,400
<i>- I think we could pull in these.
- Definitely.</i>

172
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,600
- Pub?
- Yeah, hair of the dog.

173
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,920
I'm ready. Put a bit of lippy on and away we go.

174
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,440
<i>- Hi, Liz.
- Hi, Zoe. How are you?</i>

175
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,640
Ooh.

176
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,400
Didn't expect that one!

177
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,600
Morning, Tina.

178
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:06,120
Birds that live here in North America,
they fly all the way to South America.

179
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,080
Yeah?

180
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,800
<i>That's a journey and a half, isn't it?</i>

181
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,280
But the... the biggest journey of them all
is of the arctic tern.

182
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,280
Because he flies from the Arctic...

183
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:21,760
Yeah?... all the way - wow,
across the world - to the South Pole.

184
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,680
Isn't that incredible?

185
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,760
From the North to the South Pole
and that is... ssh!

186
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,560
And that is 9,300 miles. That's right.

187
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,560
Wow, wow.

188
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,040
All right, Nick, do the other side now.

189
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,760
<i>Here we go, look. No, don't pull it out.</i>

190
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,560
What we can do... Shall we give him...
Shall we give him a few bits?

191
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,360
Do you want to give him... I like that, I like that.

192
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,480
<i>- Shall we give him one here?
- No.</i>

193
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,600
<i>No?</i>

194
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,840
He's got eyebrows, look.

195
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,800
<i>- Yeah?
- Let me see.</i>

196
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,400
I think that's brilliant. That's brilliant.

197
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,280
Here we go.

198
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,520
Shall I put some more yellow in that?
There we go.

199
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,520
<i>What colours do you think
your feathers could be?</i>

200
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,440
See, you could do a rainbow colour.
That's a good idea, isn't it?

201
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:23,320
- I did a rainbow.
- Do a rainbow. Rainbows like parrots.

202
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,960
<i>Don't put that on yet.</i>

203
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,640
<i>Let's have a look.</i>

204
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,800
Little bit more. What about the fringing?

205
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,480
You could do a bit more
on the fringing there, couldn't you?

206
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,160
Hungry? It's going to be lunch time soon.

207
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,760
But I'm not a cook.
It's lunch time in a minute.

208
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,320
We're going to lunch in a minute.

209
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,280
You can wash your hands.

210
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,960
Who's ready?

211
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,920
Hey!

212
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,600
Oh, wow! That is fantastic. Look at you go!

213
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:02,520
Whooh! Flap your arms. Flap your wings.

214
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,960
Bit dangerous, innit?

215
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,520
What?

216
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,280
Putting these over their heads.

217
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,360
I'm trying to suffocate them.
That's my goal. Little buggers.

218
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,720
<i>- They look great.
- How was your weekend?</i>

219
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,920
- Crap.
- Oh, no, why's that, then?

220
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,120
I didn't do much, just stayed in, really.

221
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,440
It's the weekend, Tash.

222
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,840
<i>- I know. I had a run-in with my mum.
- Did ya?</i>

223
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,680
Mm. My sister was working Saturday.
I had to look after Jasmine.

224
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,240
- How is she?
- That girl eats too much.

225
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,440
Bless her.

226
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,400
She ate three chicken legs and four jam tarts
and then wants to tell me she's starving.

227
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,680
The little piglet.

228
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,040
<i>- I dropped her off to my mum's.
- Yeah?</i>

229
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,680
I said you've got to tell Sherryanne
that she needs to put this girl on a diet.

230
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,200
You'll give her a complex, she's 7.

231
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,720
All of a sudden Mum doesn't want to get
involved, for the first time in her life.

232
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:56,040
Then I'm just leaving the house
and my two aunts arrive from Dollis Hill.

233
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,120
Oh, no.

234
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,880
So we get the Spanish Inquisition.
"Tash, you got a boyfriend?

235
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:04,920
Are you getting married soon? Why don't you
give your mother another grandchild?

236
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,200
You know she nearly 60. She getting old. "

237
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,240
Aargh!

238
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,640
I was, like, "I haven't got a boyfriend.
I won't be getting married soon,

239
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,440
and, no, I won't be investing
in a mortgage in the near future,

240
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,960
thank you very much. "

241
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,520
- Then I just closed the door and left.
- End of.

242
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,280
- You cooking?
- Yeah, are you cooking?

243
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,040
I'm cooking with gas. What we having?

244
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,680
- Food.
- That makes a change.

245
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,200
- Are you hungry?
- I'm ravishing.

246
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,440
- Aren't you just.
- Thank you.

247
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,760
How did it go today?

248
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,920
What, with my flying flock of feathered friends?

249
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,040
Good, they loved it. Flapping away they were.

250
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,480
- Were they?
- Yeah, bless them.

251
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,920
I had to nip it in the bud with my lot
before they flew out the window.

252
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,320
It was OK, though, was it?

253
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,480
Oh, yeah, I played them Stravinsky after lunch
just to calm them down.

254
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,240
- What did you play?
- The Rite Of Spring.

255
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,040
I booked my first driving lesson.

256
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,200
- Did you?
- Yeah.

257
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,920
- When is it?
- 12 o'clock, Saturday.

258
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,120
Excellent, well done you.

259
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,720
- I'll set the table.
- Yeah, it's nearly ready.

260
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,760
Yeah, I know.

261
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,840
<i>I love the end of the week.
- You don't say.</i>

262
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,320
- I do, actually.
- Do you?

263
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,760
- Yeah.
- Oh.

264
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,840
You know I take this dance class
on a Friday afternoon, the golden time.

265
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,240
<i>I swear to God, half the kids are bigger than me.</i>

266
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,480
- That's not hard, though, is it, eh, titch?
- No, I don't mean taller, I mean wider.

267
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,880
You want to be careful, you know?

268
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:47,840
You don't want the kids jumping about
expressing themselves. A bit dangerous.

269
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,360
Yeah, you do all that on Friday,

270
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:53,120
but then they spend the weekend indoors,
glued to their Nintendo DS.

271
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,200
Totally. A couple of weeks ago
I came in Monday -

272
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,440
I told Poppy - sat the kids down for carpet time,

273
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,440
asked them what they did over the weekend.

274
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,720
<i>Gorgeous weather.
Not one of them had been out.</i>

275
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,120
They'd all been sitting at home
on their PlayStations.

276
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,520
- You couldn't get them up off the carpet.
- When they got up, they were wheezing.

277
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,760
- That's pollution for you.
- We always used to go to the park.

278
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,800
<i>- A lot of them don't have parks to go to.
- Yeah, exactly.</i>

279
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,680
But you don't need a park to go for a walk.

280
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,560
If Mum and Dad don't go out, the kids don't.

281
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,960
Parents are too frightened
to let their kids play out.

282
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,640
Even a bit of green by the estate,
they don't let them play there.

283
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,760
But it's hard for a lot of mums and dads, isn't it?

284
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,600
They've had a hell of a week.
They're under pressure and stress.

285
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,680
<i>- Tell me about it.
- They get back from work, if they work...</i>

286
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,720
You know. A lot of them are
single mums, they're exhausted.

287
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,640
It's understandable if they don't take
their kids out for a lovely picnic.

288
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:41,200
It's not acceptable. Life's hard, but if
you want to find a way you find it, innit?

289
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,520
<i>- Some parents can't be bothered.
- Yeah, I know.</i>

290
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,440
So instead they let their kids
stay up half the night on chat rooms.

291
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,600
- Yeah!
- Yeah, that's worrying.

292
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,240
- Scary.
- Makes me so angry.

293
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,400
A lot of seven-year-olds know more
about the internet than we do.

294
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,680
At least people are talking about it. That's good.

295
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,280
- Is it?
- Well, yeah. It means we're aware.

296
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,840
I'm aware smoking's bad for me.
It doesn't mean I'll stop.

297
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,960
<i>- As long as you know what will kill you.
- Thanks.</i>

298
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,080
Any time.

299
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,120
I know drinking's bad for me,
but, you know... I can't help myself.

300
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,080
- Oh, shame.
- Cheers!

301
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,840
Cheers, everyone! Here's to our livers
and all who drown in them.

302
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,360
Careful, Poppy, you got your first
driving lesson tomorrow.

303
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,120
Oh, yeah, quick, put that down.

304
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,080
You don't want to mess up your blind spot.

305
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,200
- Oh, that sounds good.
- Oh, it's here. How many fingers?

306
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,280
- That must be for you.
- I'm so excited!

307
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,880
You should do some deep breathing
before you get in the car.

308
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,640
Ooh, can't see him. Wish me luck.

309
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:44,080
Good luck. I'll keep the emergency
services on standby.

310
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,840
<i>Any excuse, eh?
I know what you're like with firemen.</i>

311
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,400
Hello. Scott?

312
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,960
- Are you Poppy?
- That's me. Nice to you meet you.

313
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,720
Right, the car's just here.

314
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,000
They're not infected! What are you like?

315
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,800
They're clean, I just washed them specially,
honest.

316
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,680
- This it?
- You get in the passenger seat.

317
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:09,080
- You know it's me learning to drive?
- We have to talk a few things through.

318
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,200
Oh, have we? Fair enough. If you insist.

319
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,040
- Did you choose this colour car?
- Make yourself comfortable.

320
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:20,320
- Thank you. Is this your car?
- No, it's the company's car.

321
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,680
- Oh, right, what's your car like, then?
- It is my car.

322
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,000
You said it was the company's car.
Make your mind up.

323
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,480
- Have you got your provisional licence?
- Yep!

324
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,240
There you go. That's me on a bad day.

325
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,120
- Is that your real name, Pauline?
- Right.

326
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,560
- OK, everything seems to be in order.
- Does it? That's good.

327
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,680
Now, have you ever had
a driving lesson before?

328
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,520
Yeah. No, it wasn't really a lesson.
It was in a Cadillac in Miami.

329
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,640
Bunny-hopped down the beach.
I was a bit pissed, it was hilarious.

330
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,720
We won't be pissed when driving this car, OK?

331
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,480
We're not going to bunny-hop.
We'll focus and concentrate.

332
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,080
I'm going to take you to a spot
we take all learner drivers.

333
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,600
- Are you?
- We'll go through the cockpit drill.

334
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,720
- Oh, naughty.
- You'll listen and take responsibility.

335
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,960
I'll see what I can do.

336
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,800
- OK. Put your seat belt on.
- Will do, Captain Scott.

337
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,480
Here we go, gigolo.

338
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,800
- So you spoke to the office?
- I spoke to your boss.

339
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,800
He's not my boss, I work for myself.
I'm my own man.

340
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,560
But it's his car... or it's your car... Someone.

341
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,600
And they told you the price - £22.50 an hour?

342
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,360
That's right. Cheap as chips, you lot.

343
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,440
<i>- We may be cheap but we're better.
- Are you?</i>

344
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,480
You go with the big companies,
they use inexperienced instructors.

345
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,680
They don't?

346
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,560
<i>They've just passed their test and charge more.</i>

347
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,280
Bastards.

348
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:39,240
Us experienced instructors, we go
with small companies and charge less.

349
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,360
<i>- That makes a lot of sense, that does.
- Cheapness is relative.</i>

350
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,000
Yeah, it is. You're right. Bang-on!

351
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,680
So, do you want the same time every week?

352
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,840
Go on, then.

353
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,680
- Do you or don't you? I need to know.
- Well, if you need to know.

354
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,160
If it's good for you, it's good for me, Scott.

355
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,120
OK, 12 o'clock every Saturday.

356
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:04,200
- Do you like working Saturdays?
- I only work half day, Saturday.

357
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,480
- Oh, that's good.
- You're my last pupil.

358
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,800
What do you do for the rest of the day?
Are you going out tonight?

359
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,880
I shall go home and read my book.

360
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,800
Oh, it must be a good book. What is it?

361
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,600
It's a book.

362
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,760
Yeah, well, we worked that much out.

363
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,440
- You see three pedals in front of you.
- Yeah, yeah.

364
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,800
Will you put your left foot on the left-hand pedal
and push it all the way down?

365
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,440
He's a bit frisky, isn't he?

366
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,880
OK, Pauline.
Please take your boot off the pedal.

367
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:43,520
Nobody's called me Pauline
since I was two years old. Makes me laugh.

368
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,920
What am I supposed to call you?

369
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,960
- Oh, how about Poppy?
- Poppy?

370
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,400
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

371
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,840
No, whatever turns you on, Scott. I don't mind.

372
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,160
OK, Poppy. Your boots are inappropriate
for a driving lesson.

373
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,920
- What's wrong with them?
- You can't control a car in high heels.

374
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,320
I can do a lot in these.
You should see me in these on a dance floor.

375
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,360
- They may be good on a dance floor.
- Not just good on a dance floor.

376
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,440
They are "Oooh".

377
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,240
They may be good in a Cadillac on a beach

378
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,720
when you're pissed with your boyfriend,
but they're not suitable for driving.

379
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,840
You're funny.

380
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,280
Now, next week
I want you to bring flat-soled shoes.

381
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,440
- I don't look any good in them.
- It's not how you look, it's how you drive.

382
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,080
I'll see what I can rustle up for you, Scott.
Leave it to me.

383
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,440
Right, you see three mirrors -

384
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,880
your two side-view mirrors
and your rear-view mirror.

385
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,680
- They make a golden triangle.
- Is that like the pubic triangle?

386
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:29,400
It's a pyramid and at the top of it
you see the all-seeing eye - Enrahah.

387
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,320
Can you repeat that, please? "En-ra-hah".

388
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,440
- You talking about the eye of Lucifer?
- No!

389
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,760
Cos I don't know if I want to look in there,
thank you.

390
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,560
It's not Lucifer. There are
two fallen angels before Lucifer.

391
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,280
- There is Enrahah, Raziel and Lucifer.
- I don't have them in my phone book.

392
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,680
- Bear with me.
- Where is he?

393
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,120
- Bear with me.
- I can't see him.

394
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,600
- It's a teaching tool.
- Is it?

395
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,760
Let me explain something to you about teaching.

396
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,600
The teacher's job is to bring out good habits
in the pupil and to get rid of bad habits.

397
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,200
He does that through
frequent repetitive thinking.

398
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,640
And he does that by creating clear
and distinct images

399
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,280
that are easy for the pupil to retain.

400
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,240
- Oh, does he, now?
- Yes.

401
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,320
Don't worry, it's burnt in there.

402
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,040
You remember. You will remember
Enrahah till the day you die

403
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,400
and I will have done my job.

404
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,320
Why don't you have something nice up there
like a giant strawberry?

405
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,960
Believe you me, it works.

406
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,800
- OK, stop!
- What am I doing now?

407
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,280
Please take your hand off the gear.
Off the gear stick!

408
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,800
- All right.
- Foot off the pedal.

409
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,560
- I'm not touching anything.
- Let me explain to you something.

410
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,520
This car is my livelihood.
This car is how I earn my living.

411
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,680
- I don't know how you earn your living.
- Yeah.

412
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,520
But if I walked into your pub
or your discotheque or your club

413
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,040
and I walked up to the DJ
and I scratched all his records,

414
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,360
or I smashed all the glasses,

415
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:38,560
and I said, "I'm sorry, I didn't know
what I was doing," that wouldn't be acceptable.

416
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,320
There is only one problem with that.

417
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,720
I don't own a bar or a disco.
I'm just a primary school teacher.

418
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,840
- Are you?
- Afraid so, kiddo.

419
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,680
Are you a Satanist, Scott?

420
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:55,480
- No, in fact I'm exactly the opposite.
- Are you the Pope, then?

421
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,200
- That's the same thing.
- Is it? Does he know that?

422
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:03,160
Right, you have three pedals, A, B, C.
Accelerator, brake and clutch.

423
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,440
# Talking about...
Lovely.

424
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,720
- Good.
- Yeah.

425
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,200
What's he like?

426
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,880
- You'd love him.
- Would I?

427
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,040
He made me laugh. He was funny.

428
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,040
What? Like funny "Ha ha" or funny peculiar?

429
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,920
- Bit of both, actually.
- So, what happened, then?

430
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,240
- He shouted at me.
- What? He gave you a telling off?

431
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,240
He's a little bit uptight. Just a little bit.

432
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,880
- Bet you wound him up.
- Might set you up with him.

433
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,840
- Is he fit?
- Yeah.

434
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,960
No, he's not fit at all. Just your type.

435
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,760
What do I get out of it?
- You get a shag whenever you want.

436
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,440
When was the last time that happened?

437
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,960
Who's fault's that, eh?
Where are you going? Suzy!

438
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,920
- You all right?
- All right?

439
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,600
- What's going on?
- Come on.

440
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,560
- You shouting at my little sister?
- No.

441
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,600
- Doesn't look like it, does it?
- Poppy!

442
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,560
- Where are you going?
- Fuck off!

443
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,120
Not coming with us, apparently. Adios.

444
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,280
Suze!

445
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,400
Ooh.

446
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,480
- Morning, Poppy.
- All right?

447
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,760
- What's the matter?
- Buggered my back, haven't I?

448
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,480
- Looks like it.
- Trampolining.

449
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,040
- Trampolining? Really?
- Yeah, I go every week.

450
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,760
- What? After school?
- I love it.

451
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,600
Great.

452
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,560
You've got to keep the muscles a-pumping.

453
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,720
- Cos I've just started flamenco.
- You haven't?

454
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:39,640
- It's fantastic.
- I've always wanted to do it. Bit of that.

455
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,920
- Careful.
- I'm all right.

456
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,760
- Come along, if you want.
- When is it?

457
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,400
Every Tuesday, 6:30.

458
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,440
- Well, see how you feel.
- All right.

459
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,280
- Morning, Leanne.
- Morning.

460
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,800
Stink of urine round here.

461
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,080
- I can't smell anything.
- Have you peed your pants?

462
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,160
Yeah, sorry.

463
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,040
- You're a naughty girl.
- Tell me about it.

464
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,040
Ow!

465
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,280
- You all right?
- Yeah.

466
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,560
Come on, we're nearly there.

467
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,800
- Have you lost your sense of smell?
- Yeah, smoking dulls your senses.

468
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,040
- And your brain. Here we go.
- Go on, then.

469
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,280
Done that.

470
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,760
- All done?
- Yeah, thanks.

471
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,960
OK.

472
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,920
Take care.

473
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,600
- OK, who have we got next?
- Poppy Cross.

474
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,520
Thanks.

475
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,400
Poppy? No, I'm Zoe. Nice to meet you.

476
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,760
No, I'm Poppy, sorry about her.
Don't know who she is.

477
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,600
- My name's Ezra.
- Hello, Ezra.

478
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,040
- You want to just follow me upstairs?
- Yeah.

479
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,520
- You're big, aren't you?
- Good luck!

480
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,320
- Just take your time.
- What are you going to do to me?

481
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,600
Ooh!

482
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,760
Makes me laugh.

483
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,400
OK, I'm just going to feel the muscles
in your back.

484
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,760
- Right.
- And you let me know where the pain is.

485
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,720
I'll send you a text.

486
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,360
Strong fingers.

487
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,200
That tickles.

488
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,360
- Oooh! Bang on the money.
- OK.

489
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,280
- Ow...
- And this side?

490
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,880
Yeah.

491
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:15,000
OK. Do you want to reach down to your side
as if you're picking something up?

492
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,080
Picking chickens.

493
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,520
No, sorry. I can't do that. Ow! Oooh.

494
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,920
Is it your back?

495
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,960
Sorry?

496
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,720
Cos it can affect everything, can't it?

497
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,400
Like your mood and everything.

498
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,520
- Nice action.
- Lie on your back for me, please.

499
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:50,080
Must get one of these. Come in very handy.

500
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,480
Oooh! Ow.

501
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:55,760
OK, I'm just going to ask you to roll
yourself onto your side, facing me.

502
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,360
You don't ask for much do you, eh?

503
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,640
I'm going to feel the muscles in your spine again.

504
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,880
Ooh.

505
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,680
Oh!

506
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,960
# What-d'you-ma-call-it,
ding dang dilly dilly da da, hoo-hoo!

507
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,360
OK.

508
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,480
All right, lie back.

509
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,400
There we go.

510
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,080
There's a joint in your spine that's jammed up.

511
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,320
Oh, no.

512
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,560
- Would you like me to release it?
- Is it serious?

513
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,960
- It's not too bad.
- What you going to do? Will it hurt?

514
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,920
It may for a few days.

515
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,520
<i>- Go on, then. Go for your life.
- Are you sure?</i>

516
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,040
If you're quick.

517
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:42,080
OK. I'm going to roll you over and you'll
feel a short sharp click in your back.

518
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:46,040
OK? Breathe in. And...

519
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,960
Oh. Wait a minute.

520
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
OK. Are you ready?

521
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,280
Yeah.

522
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,480
OK, breathe in...

523
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,160
- OK.
- And release.

524
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,640
Oh, hoochy coochy ga-la!

525
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,160
OK. Just relax for me.

526
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,600
Didn't know you were going to do that.

527
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,600
Ooh.

528
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,600
<i>Just relax and breathe normally.</i>

529
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,960
<i>OK, would you like to sit up for me?</i>

530
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,920
Yeah.

531
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,400
Will this be a regular occurrence,
chopping and changing?

532
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,400
- Sorry, Scott. Something came up.
- I've got a life too, you know.

533
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,080
- I had to make an appointment.
- Isn't this an appointment?

534
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,840
I couldn't help it.

535
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,240
The road to hell is paved with good intentions.

536
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,200
Sounds like fun.

537
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,040
Having a bad day, are you?

538
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,680
<i>- I had a bad pupil this morning.
- Oh, no, what did he do?</i>

539
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,680
He was late, he refused to pay his money.

540
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,240
He slammed the door and swore at me.

541
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:51,240
<i>- You shout at him, did you?
- I drove off, I'm not teaching him again.</i>

542
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,560
- You show him.
- He's rude, he's arrogant,

543
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,240
he's overconfident and he's too street.

544
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,360
You don't like that.

545
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,000
He's been overindulged
and encouraged to express himself.

546
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,920
Express himself! Chop his hands off!

547
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,800
<i>Do you know what it means when they do that?</i>

548
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,560
- Go on.
- How little do they know.

549
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,040
How little do their mothers know.

550
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,640
And they smell.

551
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:14,120
It's not easy being you, is it? Eh?

552
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,360
Fancy meeting you here, hey?

553
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,720
You don't have to laugh, I'll let you off.

554
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,600
OK, gently, gently, gently, gently.

555
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,080
- Steady progression.
- Sorry.

556
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:55,320
Take your foot off the brake.
There's no need to put your foot on the brake.

557
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,600
- Do you know what's doing that?
- What is doing that?

558
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:00,400
- Your boots. Your boots are doing that.
- No, I was taking my time.

559
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,800
- I panicked.
- Your boots, they're inappropriate.

560
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,840
OK, on.

561
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,160
Poppy, come on.
Let's pick up some speed. OK?

562
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,320
<i>- Don't shout at me, Scott.
- Well, don't dilly dally, let's just go. OK.</i>

563
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,920
- I'm just learning.
- Next left-hand turn. OK?

564
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,320
- You panic me.
- So, mirror, signal, manoeuvre.

565
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,520
<i>- Gets me right there.
- Enrahah, Enrahah.</i>

566
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,360
Both hands on the wheel, Enrahah. Enrahah.

567
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,240
I don't like that, gives me the creeps.

568
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:29,560
<i>OK, Poppy. Indicate. Mirror, signal, manoeuvre.</i>

569
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,640
<i>- Indicate.
- Signal, OK.</i>

570
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,880
- How am I doing?
- Foot down on the brake. Clutch.

571
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,600
You don't want to stall. OK, find your biting point
and peep and creep.

572
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,520
- First gear. Peep and creep.
- First gear.

573
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,920
- Peep and creep.
- Peeping and a-creeping.

574
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:53,000
- When you get to the end of the road...
- Ooh, he's nice.

575
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,120
When we get to the end of the road...
Can you please focus on the driving?

576
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,200
Enrahah, Enrahah.

577
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,440
<i>- Enrahah. OK!
- I... That's a bit weird.</i>

578
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,640
<i>Foot on the brake, clutch. You don't want to stall.</i>

579
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,480
<i>Find your bite.
Can you feel you're slightly on a hill?</i>

580
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,320
- No.
- OK, put the hand brake on.

581
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,800
Find your biting point.
OK, lock your door. Lock your door.

582
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,240
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Poppy, there's two of them.

583
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,160
<i>- Are you taking the piss?
- Lock your door.</i>

584
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,840
- OK, let's go. Let's go, Poppy, let's go.
- I don't believe you just said that.

585
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,800
Let's go. On you go. On you go.

586
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,840
- Let's go that way.
- Poppy! Poppy, let's go!

587
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,720
- We're on a bend. Now, let's go.
- Blimey, O'Reilly.

588
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,880
Right, on you go. Keep to the left
of the centre of the road.

589
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:41,360
Usual time next week? 12 o'clock?
You can check it if you like.

590
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,320
See you.

591
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,720
Cheerio.

592
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,440
All right, doggie?

593
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,080
<i>Here's another one.
- Yeah.</i>

594
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,240
Circle, completely red.

595
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,800
What? Like a tomato?

596
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,800
For instance. White horizontal line.

597
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,400
Give us a clue, Zoe.

598
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,880
Horizontal, parallel to the horizon.

599
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,200
Thank you, Miss Marsh.

600
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:16,600
- You're welcome.
- So, it's not... up and down like a yoyo.

601
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,160
- No.
- Right.

602
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,760
- What is it?
- Vertical.

603
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,160
- No, you muppet, the sign.
- That'd be "no entry".

604
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,520
- For what?
- For black boys on bicycles.

605
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,600
- Don't get me started on that again.
- It just popped out of his mouth.

606
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:31,440
- You can always get another instructor.
- Yeah, I know. See how it goes, eh?

607
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,040
- Ask me another.
- This is also a red circle.

608
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,280
- Yeah.
- Black car - this isn't a racist thing.

609
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,320
- Glad to hear it.
- Next to the black car is a red car.

610
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,960
That's Mr Golly overtaking Noddy.

611
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,160
- Enrahah.
- Enrahah to you.

612
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,920
- What is it?
- No overtaking.

613
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,440
- Enrahah.
- Enrahah-ha-ha!

614
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,800
- He sounds like a nutter.
- He is a nutter.

615
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,520
- How's your back?
- It's all right, actually. He sorted it.

616
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,000
Magic fingers. He was sweet, wasn't he?

617
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,960
He was fit.

618
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,840
Octagonal sign with "stop" written in it.

619
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,880
- Stop!
- All right, then.

620
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,800
Who's going to blink first?

621
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:23,040
- Do you want a cup of tea?
- Yes, please.

622
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:28,440
No, you have the lasagna tonight.
We can finish the chicken tomorrow.

623
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,120
Look, I can't talk now. See you later.

624
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,160
- Do you think we'll make it?
- Depends on the traffic.

625
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,720
Should be all right. Ooh, that's my back!

626
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:57,480
Hey, come in, ladies, as quick as you can.

627
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,400
<i>Do want to put your bags,
and there's a couple of places.</i>

628
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,680
- Sorry we're late.
- Sorry.

629
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:05,680
No problem, it's very Spanish to be late.
Take your places. Then we can start.

630
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,640
Here.

631
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,360
I was just introducing myself
to the peoples what don't know me.

632
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,040
It's lovely to see you again
and lovely you bring a friend.

633
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,800
Welcome in my class.

634
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:23,080
So, my name is Rositta Santos
and I'm coming from Sevilla in Spain.

635
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:26,400
Or Seville, what you say here.

636
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:33,840
<i>What is famous for our bullfighting,
our beautiful oranges -</i>

637
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:39,320
what your English peoples
turn into disgusting marmalade.

638
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,880
<i>Are you going to keep
those sunglasses on, then?</i>

639
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:46,840
And also is the birth home of flamenco.

640
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,400
Sorry.

641
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,200
Then everybody is ready... I hope.

642
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,840
<i>So, feet in parallel. Hip distance apart.</i>

643
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:16,440
Pulling up from the waist.
Opening across the chest.

644
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,920
<i>Shoulder blades drawing down to the spine.</i>

645
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,880
Arms relaxed.

646
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,080
And taking the head over to your right.

647
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,400
<i>Feeling that lovely stretch at the neck.</i>

648
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,080
Then to the left.

649
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,760
Not very flamenco, is it?

650
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,800
<i>To the right.</i>

651
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,840
<i>Bringing the head back to the centre.</i>

652
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,560
<i>And relax. Lovely.</i>

653
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,360
So, guys. We're going to reverse the abs now.

654
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,480
Right foot in front.

655
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:56,360
<i>Lifting up from the elbows
like they got strings attached.</i>

656
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,920
<i>Like little Pinocchio.</i>

657
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,800
Lifting, lifting.

658
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:02,480
Keeping the shoulders down.
Arms above the head.

659
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:05,920
<i>Framing the face. Here I am... proud.</i>

660
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:11,440
Then bringing the arms down in front.
Pressing, pressing, pressing.

661
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:16,200
<i>Keeping the tension,
keeping the strength, but fluid as well.</i>

662
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:21,880
Then lifting up again from the elbows.
Like the eagle spreading his wings.

663
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,200
<i>Beautiful, angry, ferocious.</i>

664
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,800
And, guys, when you're lifting up
your eagle wings,

665
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:36,160
<i>remember that this dance comes from the pain,
from the suffering</i>

666
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,920
of los gitanos...

667
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,640
erm... what you say, "the gypsies".

668
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:43,960
I know this word not politically correct,

669
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,560
but these guys,
they been squashed down by society

670
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:51,000
<i>for centuries, centuries, and they say,</i>

671
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,120
"We don't need this. We got pride.

672
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,000
We got dignity.

673
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:59,000
We got heart. We got flamenco. "

674
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:03,960
They say, "This... my space. "

675
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,040
<i>My space.</i>

676
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,920
My space.

677
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,840
My space. Everybody... do this. One, two.

678
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,720
My space.

679
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,600
- And again.
- My space!

680
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,520
- Vamos! Vamos!
- My space!

681
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,440
- And again.
- My space!

682
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,640
<i>- Vamos, vamos.
- My space!</i>

683
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,520
- With meaning.
- My space!

684
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,680
But, guys.

685
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:24,800
My space!

686
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:27,160
- One more time.
- My space!

687
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,600
- With expression.
- My space!

688
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,680
- I don't believe it.
- My space!

689
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:34,480
<i>OK, guys. I'll give you two counts in.</i>

690
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:38,400
<i>Then we're going to stamp
and clap the compás, OK?</i>

691
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,680
<i>Uno, dos.</i>

692
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:50,560
Guys, guys, guys. What are you doing?

693
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,760
Where is the passion? Where is the revenge?
Where is the blood?

694
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,160
This is flamenco.

695
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,160
That clapping, so polite.
It's like the end of the opera.

696
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,600
"Excuse me, how many sugar
you want in your tea?"

697
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:07,320
This woman been spending
every Wednesday afternoon for a year

698
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,720
with your husband, in a hotel in Paddington.

699
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,640
This guy been having an affair
for five years with your best friend.

700
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,840
Your boyfriend, what you gave your love,
your spirit, for five years

701
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:24,600
betrays you with a Swedish bitch,
what is 22 years old.

702
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:28,600
You want to kill him.
You want to cut off his balls.

703
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:33,200
He's such a bastard! I hate him!

704
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,960
Are you all right?

705
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,880
Didn't bargain for that. That was something else.

706
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,400
I know, but all credit to her.

707
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,560
She picked herself up. She came straight back.

708
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:55,320
As if nothing had happened.
Like a little fireball, wasn't she?

709
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:58,120
- Not a grain of sentimentality.
- No, wipe the tears.

710
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,760
Bless her. I wanted to give her a hug.

711
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,400
I don't think she'd appreciate that.

712
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,160
No! "This is my space, get off me!"

713
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:07,440
Leaves a nasty taste, though,
exploding her heart all over the floor.

714
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,440
- Then it was "put that away".
- Stick that in a box.

715
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,240
- Get it out another time.
- Perhaps never.

716
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,920
<i>- You'll be lucky.
- I know.</i>

717
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,480
She must be going through some shit,
though, mustn't she?

718
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:19,680
<i>- She's actually a good teacher.
- Oh, yeah, definitely.</i>

719
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:21,200
She's going to burn herself out.

720
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:24,280
I believed her when she said
she'd cut off his balls, though. Didn't you?

721
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,640
I don't expect the guys will be back
next week, then?

722
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,960
No! Snip, snip.

723
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,120
- How's your love life?
- How is my love life?

724
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,640
<i>- Nothing doing?
- Not a sausage.</i>

725
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,960
- Are you OK with that?
- Oh, yeah.

726
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,280
<i>- Good for you.
- Cheers.</i>

727
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:39,120
Cheers.

728
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,320
- How's your Beth?
- Darren's dumped her.

729
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:44,440
Oh, no.

730
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,720
Just before her 18th birthday. "Thanks, Darren. "

731
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,840
<i>- Why do men always do that, eh?
- I know.</i>

732
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,120
Christmas, Valentine's Day.
Boom! They're gone.

733
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,280
- I hope he won't turn up to the party.
- Name off the list.

734
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:58,200
I'm looking at her and thinking,
"Don't call him. Don't call him. "

735
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:01,200
- "Don't do it, Beth. Don't do it. "
- You can't say anything, though.

736
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:04,880
- You've got to let them get on with it.
- You can't help being protective.

737
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,960
Of course, she's got her A levels coming up.

738
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Fingers crossed, she's going to Manchester.

739
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,760
- Fantastic. What she want to do there?
- Sociology.

740
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,840
- Lovely.
- I hope she'll take a gap year. Travel.

741
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,440
That's important, see the world.

742
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:20,640
- I think so. Cos I never got the chance.
- Nor me.

743
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:22,840
- You made up for it later, though.
- Didn't I just?

744
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,920
<i>- Where were you?
- All over the place.</i>

745
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,720
Taught in this school in Thailand, six months.
Me and Zoe.

746
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:32,480
Started off in Australia.
Zoe's got relations in Melbourne and Sydney.

747
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:37,360
Bali, Java, Malaysia, Vietnam - beautiful.
Then Thailand.

748
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,120
Fabulous.

749
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:43,280
Amazing. Gorgeous kids.
Loved learning. 60 in a class.

750
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:44,560
<i>- 60?
- Oh, yeah.</i>

751
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,680
Fantastic. Great challenge.

752
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,560
<i>- And for them.
- Especially for them.</i>

753
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:49,600
Yeah.

754
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,840
<i>- Do you want another one?
- I'd love to but I'm driving, aren't I?</i>

755
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,680
Oh, of course you are.
Got to be good. Work tomorrow.

756
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,400
Poppy, this is your third driving lesson.

757
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,960
<i>- I'm getting quite good, aren't I?
- No, you're not good.</i>

758
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,360
You're smug. You're too easily distracted.

759
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,560
You're distracted by squirrels,
by dogs, by children in the park,

760
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:00,840
by old ladies in surgical stockings,
by half-naked men in their gardens.

761
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,200
- Oh, well, he was quite fit, wasn't he?
- No, he wasn't fit, he had a paunch.

762
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:07,800
<i>- I didn't know you were checking it out.
- Keep your eyes focused on the road.</i>

763
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:11,280
This car is a lethal weapon.
Pay attention or you'll kill somebody.

764
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:13,160
Keep to the left of the centre of the road.

765
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:16,920
Oh, come on, Scott. How often do you
see a squirrel sending a text like that?

766
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,800
<i>- Left turn. Mirror, signal, Enrahah.
- Sending a little text.</i>

767
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,360
Enrahah!

768
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:29,280
I can't believe you're a teacher,
that you're in charge of 40 children.

769
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:31,440
It took me by surprise, to be honest. It's 30.

770
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:33,720
30. You have no respect for order.

771
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,720
You are arrogant, you are disruptive
and you celebrate chaos.

772
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:39,320
<i>- I slipped through the net, didn't I?
- No, you are the net.</i>

773
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:41,400
Believe you me, Poppy, you are the net.

774
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,480
OK, we're going to do the next left turn.
Mirror, signal, manoeuvre.

775
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:48,400
- Enrahah. Keep with it, Poppy.
- Oooh. Don't like this corner.

776
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:50,520
Get away from the bend.
Get away from the bend.

777
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:53,560
Do you remember the pyramid?
Do you remember the shape of the pyramid?

778
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:54,680
<i>- Enrahah.
- No.</i>

779
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:56,760
Enrahah is the eye at the top of the pyramid.

780
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,360
I'm talking about the bottom of it.

781
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,560
Those at the bottom of the pyramid
are kept in total ignorance

782
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:04,360
of what those at the top of the pyramid
are achieving. Enrahah.

783
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,720
Where are you on the pyramid?

784
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,640
- I'm outside the pyramid, looking in.
- Of course you are.

785
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:12,480
Where are you? That is more to the point.
Where are you and your children?

786
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:15,840
<i>- Where are we all, eh?
- The next left turn. Enrahah.</i>

787
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:19,080
- Did you like school, Scott?
- I'm afraid it didn't agree with me.

788
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:21,040
Oh, that's a shame.

789
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:24,440
Let me tell you something
about the education system.

790
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,840
- Oh, go on, then.
- It produces left brain prisoners.

791
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:29,480
- Do you know what that means?
- I do.

792
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,720
Well, I'll tell you. Our brain has two sides.

793
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:35,320
The left brain and the right brain.
The left brain... Keep going, keep going.

794
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:37,480
The left brain is information, data. It's dead.

795
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,560
The right brain is individuality.
It's where the soul lies.

796
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:44,480
And the education system, it works like this -
"I will give you a world view.

797
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:47,880
And if you repeat my world view,
if you reconfirm my world view,

798
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:51,720
you will pass your exams and you will
go higher and higher and higher

799
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:54,200
and you will become a policeman, a magistrate,

800
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:58,360
a lawyer, a general, a politician,
and you will be happy and you will succeed.

801
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,960
But if you think for yourself,

802
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,240
if you think outside of the box,
then you will be unhappy and you will fail. "

803
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:08,480
That's how the education system works.
Left turn. Enrahah. Signal. Enrahah.

804
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,560
Were you bullied at school, Scott?

805
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,560
We're going to do the next left turn. Enrahah.

806
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:20,120
Kids, they can be cruel, can't they, eh?

807
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,120
Nick!

808
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:31,240
Nick, what's going on? Eh?

809
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,200
Are you all right, Charlie?

810
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:35,280
Yeah, I could see that. What's going on, eh?

811
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,120
<i>Venga, venga!</i>

812
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,640
<i>Don't bounce.</i>

813
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:46,400
<i>Keep pounding.</i>

814
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:49,920
<i>Facing front.</i>

815
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:54,040
<i>Look in front of us.</i>

816
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,960
<i>It's not salsa. Keep straight.</i>

817
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,480
<i>Venga, mátalo.</i>

818
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:06,840
<i>Uno, dos, tres. Uno, dos, tres.</i>

819
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:11,040
<i>Face the front. Don't look at me.
Uno, dos, tres. Keep it pounding.</i>

820
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:15,200
Uno, dos, tres. Uno, dos, tres.
Uno, dos, tres. Uno, dos, tres.

821
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,880
Bravo, everybody.

822
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:26,040
I have to tell you, I am slightly impressed.

823
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:30,680
Much better than last week.
Though of course this is not difficult.

824
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,760
And still could improve.

825
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,880
<i>But... it will do.</i>

826
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:37,120
For now.

827
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:40,160
<i>Be quiet. Get on with it.</i>

828
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:44,360
<i>What are you writing about? All about you?</i>

829
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,320
That's lovely, Savannah.

830
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:50,920
<i>Good girl. Married with a prince, yeah?</i>

831
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:55,160
There we are. You carry on
with your work, there's a good...

832
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,080
Yeah, you carry on. You draw a picture now.

833
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:01,400
Hold on. What's going on?
Can you stop that, please?

834
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:05,120
What is happening? Are you hurting Ayotunde?

835
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,960
Are you all right? He hurt you hard?

836
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,280
He hit you? Come here.
We do not hurt our friends.

837
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,920
You come and sit over here.
Get on with your work.

838
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:20,000
You were hurting Ayotunde for no reason.
That's not very nice.

839
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,960
That's not what we do to our friends.

840
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:27,280
- I can't do these.
- Yes, you can. You carry on with that.

841
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:29,960
- Miss, I've got a tiger fish.
- OK, Chelsea.

842
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
What's happening here, eh?

843
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:42,080
You can talk to me, you know?

844
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:46,000
<i>Anything you want to say.</i>

845
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:50,160
I'm here to help you.

846
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,680
Because I'm your mate, aren't I?

847
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:04,880
- Yes.
- Yeah, that's right.

848
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:07,880
That's what mates do...

849
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,920
...isn't it?

850
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:13,080
<i>- Yes.
- Yeah.</i>

851
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,760
What's making you so angry?

852
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,760
I want to help sort this out.

853
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,680
Come on, chop chop.

854
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,960
- Hi, Jenny.
- Hi, Poppy.

855
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,720
- Poppy.
- Have you got a minute?

856
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,680
- What's up?
- I think I might have a problem.

857
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:43,800
- Come in. Sit yourself down.
- Cheers.

858
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:50,520
It's Nick, really...

859
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:26,240
You know what I mean, you know?

860
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:28,640
You know?

861
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,640
- You know?
- I know.

862
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:34,560
It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's...

863
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:35,920
Isn't it just?

864
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:38,320
<i>You know? You know, it's...</i>

865
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:43,000
You know, they, they, they, they, they...

866
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:44,480
Do they?

867
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:46,800
They're not, they're not, they're not, they're not!

868
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:49,280
They're not, you know?

869
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:50,840
Oh.

870
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:06,600
Are you warm enough?

871
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:11,840
# I know, I said that I was leaving

872
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:14,680
<i>- That's nice.
- He's, he's, he's...</i>

873
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:17,720
<i>- Is he?
- You know, he's...</i>

874
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:21,440
<i>Ah, now, and he's, he's... Oh, he's...</i>

875
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:23,800
Oh, no.

876
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:28,480
He's, he's, he's...

877
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:30,440
<i>- What is he?
- He's a prick.</i>

878
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,520
Oh! I know a few.

879
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:38,080
There you go.

880
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,640
That's it. Yeah.

881
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:44,120
<i>- You know what I mean, you know?
- Yeah, yeah.</i>

882
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,160
<i>She's, she's, she's...</i>

883
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,760
She's, she's, she's, you know. She's, she's...

884
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:52,640
<i>You know. She's, she's, she's,
she was, she was...</i>

885
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:55,920
She was, she was, she was, she was...

886
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:57,600
- She was so...
- Was she?

887
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:00,400
She wouldn't, you know.
She wouldn't. She wouldn't, you know.

888
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,640
She wouldn't, and I'm, I'm... I'm not, you know.

889
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:07,920
I'm not, you know. I'm, I'm...
She's... you know. She's...

890
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,480
She's, you know. She's...

891
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:12,960
You know, they're, they're, they're, they're...

892
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,160
You know what I mean?

893
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,000
Yeah.

894
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,040
I do.

895
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:24,160
What's your name?

896
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:26,160
Hey?

897
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:28,480
- Come on.
- Where are you going?

898
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:30,520
- Taxi!
- That'll be for me.

899
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,320
Come on, 'sake.

900
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:38,280
Keep your hair on.

901
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:42,320
I've only just met you. Mum warned me
about going with strangers.

902
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:48,000
- Where are you going?
- Longest way out, shortest way home.

903
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:49,960
Oh, sod's law.

904
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,360
- Is he gone?
- All right. What?

905
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,080
- Is he gone?
- Ease up.

906
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:57,160
- What?
- Is he gone?

907
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:58,480
You what?

908
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:01,160
- Is he gone?
- Is who gone?

909
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,440
- The rubber knocker man.
- You what?

910
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:08,320
- The rubber knocker man.
- Oh! The rubber knocker man.

911
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,760
- Sssh.
- Why didn't you say?

912
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:12,440
- Is he gone?
- Yeah, yeah. No, he's gone, he's gone.

913
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:14,440
- 'Sake.
- I see him. He's a-running.

914
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,680
He's a-rubbing his knockers. He's gone.

915
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:19,640
Oh, he's gone. Hang about.

916
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:26,160
Oh, there you go.

917
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:30,160
Found the en suite, then.

918
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,320
Shake it all about.

919
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:44,400
What am I doing?

920
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:55,160
Oh, all done, then?

921
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,320
<i>All right?</i>

922
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:20,920
Have you had your dinner?

923
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,920
No.

924
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,520
- Here you are, take that.
- No.

925
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:40,200
- Something to eat.
- No, thank you.

926
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:51,520
- Where are you going to sleep tonight?
- In a bed.

927
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:55,520
Of course you are. Silly me.

928
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,960
What?

929
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:22,320
You know?

930
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:26,040
Yeah.

931
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:17,440
Next, please.

932
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:31,800
<i>- Are you asleep?
- Yeah.</i>

933
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:46,160
So what you been up to?

934
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:50,320
- This and that.
- Ducking and a-diving.

935
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:51,840
Wheeling and a-dealing.

936
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:55,000
- So where you been?
- Tooing and a-froing.

937
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:57,200
- Seriously.
- Seriously.

938
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:00,560
I went for a walk.

939
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:02,800
<i>Thought we were going out for a drink.</i>

940
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:05,120
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

941
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:08,240
- Left you a message.
- My battery died on me.

942
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,040
- So how was your day?
- How was your day?

943
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:17,000
Fantastic, the earth moved.

944
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:21,720
- I've got a violent pupil in my flock.
- What's he doing?

945
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:24,560
- Being violent.
- What, is he hitting you?

946
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:27,400
- He's been hitting the other kids.
- What are you doing about it?

947
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,360
I spoke to Heather.

948
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:32,480
Poor little bugger.

949
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:36,880
You've got to love them, haven't you?

950
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:39,080
Yeah, otherwise you'd kill them.

951
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:42,600
So where did you go tonight?

952
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:46,320
The eternal question. Where have we been?
Where are we going?

953
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:48,280
What's the meaning of life?

954
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:52,040
I went to the moon and then back again.

955
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:55,080
- Wow, you walk quickly.
- I've got good legs.

956
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:57,680
Yeah, you've got great legs.
Not that you're my type.

957
01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:02,000
- These are great legs.
- Ah, get off. Read your palm.

958
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:07,520
Oh, I see a very strong line.

959
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:13,600
It's your bullshit line,
and I see a tall, dark, handsome... turd.

960
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:17,400
- Next to it is a bloke.
- A bloke?

961
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:19,080
- Yeah.
- Let's see.

962
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:22,720
Oh, yeah, there he is. Isn't he gorgeous?

963
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:24,680
- Not my type.
- No.

964
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:30,280
Where have all the good men gone, eh?

965
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:32,760
Well, they're not hiding in here, are they?

966
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:38,480
Come out, come out, wherever you are.
We're ready and waiting.

967
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:43,320
They haven't got the balls.

968
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:52,520
- All right, Nick?
- Yeah.

969
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:54,440
<i>- How you doing there?
- I'm reading.</i>

970
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:56,360
- What you reading?
- "Yuck!"

971
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,520
- "Yuck!" That's nice, isn't it?
- Oh, it's a classic, that.

972
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:02,720
- Nick, this is Tim.
- Hi, Nick.

973
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:03,440
Hello.

974
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:05,600
Now, Nick, when I asked you the other day,

975
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:07,440
did you know what a social worker was,

976
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:09,080
can you remember what you said?

977
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:14,040
A social worker helps you on... hard things.

978
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:16,760
A social worker helps you with hard things, yes.

979
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:18,760
- That's true.
- Yeah, very good.

980
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:20,840
That's right. And I was thinking,

981
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:23,800
how could I help Tim
to get to know you a bit better?

982
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:27,280
I was thinking, because you've done
some very good learning this year...

983
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:29,600
Oh, I'd say so, yes.
- He has, hasn't he?

984
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:33,400
And I was thinking, would you mind
showing Tim some of your work?

985
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:35,920
- No.
- That's a good idea.

986
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:37,320
I'd love to see it.

987
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:39,720
Is that, "No, you don't want to"
or "No, you don't mind"?

988
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:42,080
- No, I don't mind.
- I didn't think you would.

989
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:44,520
Well, that's good, isn't it? What's it going to be?

990
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:46,840
- You come and sit here. Have a look.
- Oh, thanks.

991
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:50,280
- We should show off your maths.
- Are you good at maths, Nick?

992
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:54,880
- Are you all right, sweet? A bit tired?
- Let's have a look at this. Here.

993
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,800
- What's this, then?
- Look.

994
01:03:57,840 --> 01:04:00,840
- This is last term.
- Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.

995
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:03,240
Oh, he's good at his numbers.
- Very good.

996
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:05,600
- Yeah, smiley faces.
- I'm going to see you later, OK?

997
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:08,280
- See you.
- Thanks, Mrs Stockman. See you soon.

998
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:12,360
- Smiley face, big smiley face there.
- Smiley face, ticks everywhere.

999
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:15,280
- Very good.
- All last term this was.

1000
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:18,280
Isn't it? Not bad.

1001
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:20,040
Is it good this term as well?

1002
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:23,280
Er... yes, it's a bit on and off. Isn't it?

1003
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:25,600
- Oh, yeah.
- Not so good.

1004
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:27,960
- We'll get around that, though.
- Of course.

1005
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:32,240
You know you're not in trouble, don't you, Nick?

1006
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:34,840
<i>- Yeah.
- Yeah.</i>

1007
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:37,520
No-one could be angry with you. Not for long.

1008
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:42,120
You've been a bit angry, though, haven't you?

1009
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:43,720
Yeah.

1010
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:48,480
<i>- What's made you angry?
- I don't know.</i>

1011
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:50,040
<i>You don't know?</i>

1012
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:52,240
What's it like at home?

1013
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:54,200
Fine.

1014
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:56,520
<i>- Yeah, with you and your mum?
- Yeah.</i>

1015
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:57,360
Yeah.

1016
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:59,600
<i>- You get on with your mum, don't you?
- Yeah.</i>

1017
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:03,120
<i>- Does anybody else come to the house?
- No.</i>

1018
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:06,280
No? What about any of Mummy's friends?

1019
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:08,320
Has she got a boyfriend?

1020
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:09,840
Yeah, she does.

1021
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:14,160
<i>She does? What's his name?</i>

1022
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:15,600
Jason.

1023
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:17,440
<i>Jason.</i>

1024
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:19,240
<i>Is Jason nice?</i>

1025
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:20,840
No.

1026
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:28,720
Has he been making you angry, Nick?

1027
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:31,440
Yeah.

1028
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:33,040
That's no good, is it?

1029
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:38,160
Have you got a piece of paper, Miss Cross?

1030
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:40,240
Yeah, sure we could rustle one up.

1031
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:42,480
- You good at drawing, Nick?
- Yeah.

1032
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:43,600
OK.

1033
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:49,560
- Here we go.
- Let's get you a pencil.

1034
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:52,200
There you go.

1035
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:57,520
Take that, Nick, and what I'd like you to do,
is draw me a house.

1036
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:00,040
Do you think you can do that?

1037
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:01,640
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1038
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:03,360
Thought so.

1039
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:07,080
<i>That's your mum, in her bedroom.</i>

1040
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:09,600
<i>- And who else is there?
- Jason.</i>

1041
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:12,120
<i>Jason's there. Where's he?</i>

1042
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:15,560
<i>- He's in the living room.
- In the living room.</i>

1043
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:19,280
<i>- You're all in different rooms, aren't you?
- Mm-hm.</i>

1044
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:22,960
<i>Why are you in a different room to Jason?</i>

1045
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:27,160
<i>- Because he's not nice to me.
- He's not nice. What does he do to you?</i>

1046
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:28,680
He hits me.

1047
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:32,040
<i>- He hits you.
- Yeah.</i>

1048
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,640
<i>You know that's not right, don't you, Nick?</i>

1049
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:43,440
- It was lovely to meet you.
- Yeah, you too.

1050
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:45,200
Thank you. I think he'll be all right.

1051
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:46,560
- Of course.
- Yeah.

1052
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:50,080
- He's got a good teacher.
- Has he? Where is she? I can't see her.

1053
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:52,840
- I'm looking at her.
- Oh. Thank you very much.

1054
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:56,640
- I wouldn't mind looking at her again.
- She wouldn't mind looking at you again.

1055
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:58,280
Really? That's good.

1056
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:00,440
- Give us your number.
- OK, I'll write it down.

1057
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:02,400
That's a start.

1058
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:10,800
There you go.

1059
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:13,400
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

1060
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:15,360
- Goodbye.
- See you.

1061
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:29,280
Are you all right? Had a good week?

1062
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:31,240
<i>- Yeah.
- Oh, that's a bonus.</i>

1063
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:34,640
Smells in here.

1064
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,440
<i>I didn't know you had a dog.</i>

1065
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:40,920
No, it isn't a dog. I just had a lesson.

1066
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:43,160
<i>- Bit stinky, was he?
- Could say that.</i>

1067
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:48,040
<i>- You got a dog?
- No, I live in a flat.</i>

1068
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:52,240
Be cruel, wouldn't it? I'd love a dog.
Have you ever had a dog?

1069
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:54,720
- Your mum and dad got a dog?
- My dad's dead.

1070
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:56,720
<i>Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.</i>

1071
01:07:57,720 --> 01:07:59,920
<i>- How do you get on with your mum?
- I don't.</i>

1072
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:00,920
Oh.

1073
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:05,720
You live with your mum and dad?

1074
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:07,600
No.

1075
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:10,080
How old do you think I am, 12?

1076
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:13,640
<i>- 22, 23?
- Oh, I like you.</i>

1077
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:15,600
You can stay.

1078
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:17,880
I'm 30.

1079
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:19,640
Old maid, now.

1080
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:25,200
So, do you live on your own?

1081
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:27,840
No. I live with my flatmate.

1082
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:31,760
Nearly 10 years now. She done well, bless her.

1083
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:35,320
- That's a long time.
- She's gorgeous. I love her.

1084
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:39,480
What do you mean, you love her?

1085
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:43,960
I mean, I love her. She loves me.
We love each other.

1086
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,400
What, so you're...

1087
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:51,880
What?

1088
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:58,400
Yeah, that's it. That's us.

1089
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:07,280
- You got a problem with that, Scott?
- No, nothing to do with me.

1090
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:10,680
I don't think it is.

1091
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:17,800
- OK, check your mirrors. Enrahah.
- Yeah, checking, checking.

1092
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:20,600
Indicate and knock on the door,
let them know you want to come in.

1093
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:23,920
Knock on the door, OK. Put your foot
down on the clutch. Put it in first gear.

1094
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:26,400
OK, find your biting point just before you go.
OK, stop.

1095
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:28,080
- What?
- Put the car in neutral.

1096
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:29,960
Put the car in neutral, the hand brake on.

1097
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:33,520
Take your hand off the steering wheel,
foot off the pedal, turn off the ignition.

1098
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:35,400
<i>- I haven't started.
- I've stopped.</i>

1099
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:37,800
- Now you tell me why I've stopped.
- Got a headache?

1100
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:40,760
No. Yes! I have got a headache
and you tell me why I've got one.

1101
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:44,680
Erm... I don't know. Time of the month?
Oh, give me a clue.

1102
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:47,000
Well, think. Top to toe. Top to toe.

1103
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:49,960
<i>- Boots, Poppy. Boots.
- Oh, here we go.</i>

1104
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,880
Every week I ask you,
"Please wear appropriate footwear. "

1105
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:55,440
And every week you insist
on wearing those stupid boots.

1106
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:57,680
<i>- Yeah, sorry about that.
- You know what this is?</i>

1107
01:09:57,720 --> 01:09:59,680
<i>- This is vanity before safety.
- Oh, right.</i>

1108
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:02,560
"I'm sorry, Mrs Jones. I'm sorry.
Poppy killed your child,

1109
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:05,760
but don't worry, she looked really cool
in her sexy, seductive boots. "

1110
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:07,720
<i>- Am I keeping you awake at night?
- No.</i>

1111
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:09,080
Are you sure about that?

1112
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:11,640
Shall we get on with the lesson?

1113
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:13,480
Will you do something about your boots?

1114
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:16,800
I don't think so. They're fine. I'm comfy in these.

1115
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:19,000
A lot of people drive in heels.

1116
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:21,920
Very well, on your head be it.

1117
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:23,720
Yeah, okey-dokey.

1118
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:34,640
Keep to the left of the centre. Enrahah. Enrahah.

1119
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:36,440
When we come to this bend, what do we do?

1120
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:39,680
<i>- Are you expecting the worst?
- We keep to the left.</i>

1121
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:41,240
<i>We expect a juggernaut, OK?</i>

1122
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:43,360
- Expect the worst.
- Expecting the worst.

1123
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:45,520
<i>- More gas, more gas.
- Expecting the worst.</i>

1124
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:46,920
<i>- Expecting the worst.
- More gas.</i>

1125
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:50,080
- There's a juggernaut, get down!
- Poppy, put both hands on the wheel

1126
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:51,880
and keep your eyes on the road!

1127
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:54,600
- There was a juggernaut, Scott.
- There wasn't a juggernaut.

1128
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:57,360
- That was a stupid thing to do, Poppy.
- There was a little...

1129
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:59,520
- Give me gas. Give me gas.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1130
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:01,680
- I'm giving you gas.
- Away from the bend. Give me gas.

1131
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:08,960
Right.

1132
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:10,840
<i>- Poppy.
- Yeah?</i>

1133
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:13,480
I am not going to allow you
to endanger both of us,

1134
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:15,480
just for you to have your stupid little joke.

1135
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:18,760
<i>I mean, if you want to make jokes,
if that's what you want to do,</i>

1136
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:21,560
then I will gladly sit here
and you can take the mickey out of me

1137
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:23,760
for £22.50 an hour - it's your money.

1138
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:26,720
<i>- I'm big enough. I can take it.
- Can you?</i>

1139
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:29,720
But I will not allow you
to endanger yourself, myself,

1140
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:32,120
and other road users just for your amusement.

1141
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:33,720
I wasn't taking the mickey, Scott.

1142
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:36,200
<i>- I'm sorry.
- Don't touch me! Don't you touch me!</i>

1143
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:39,080
Right, that's it. Get out!

1144
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:41,680
- What's happening now?
- Get in the passenger seat.

1145
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:44,760
- Why?
- The lesson is over. I'm taking you home.

1146
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:49,160
Oh. So, that's that, then, is it?

1147
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:51,120
<i>All right, then.</i>

1148
01:11:56,840 --> 01:12:00,600
Speak to the office and when they ask you,
tell them I can't teach you.

1149
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:06,960
Fucking!

1150
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,760
Take it easy, Scott. It's all right. It's all right.

1151
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:22,080
Well, come on, then. Let's go.
It's costing me enough money as it is.

1152
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:27,440
All I ask is that you behave like an adult.

1153
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:30,800
What? Like you, Scott?

1154
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:38,080
It's like musical cars, this.

1155
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:43,000
- What now?
- Get in the driver's seat, please.

1156
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:44,920
I've never given up on a pupil.

1157
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:51,640
Oh, so that bit's over, is it?
Oh, well, make your mind up.

1158
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:55,280
Do you want to have a walk,
get a breath of fresh air or something?

1159
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:57,240
No? All right, then.

1160
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:06,480
Check your mirrors.

1161
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:15,480
What about that guy you gave up on
the other week, eh?

1162
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:18,560
He passed his test this morning.

1163
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:21,920
<i>- Oh, well, that's good.
- He didn't deserve to.</i>

1164
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:24,320
He was very rude.
He didn't even say thank you.

1165
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:28,760
I don't know, some people. Doesn't take much.

1166
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:30,840
<i>- It's just the little things.
- That's right.</i>

1167
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:33,480
Enrahah.

1168
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:35,600
Keep to the left of the centre of the road.

1169
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:41,760
You can make jokes while you're driving,
but you will crash and you will die laughing.

1170
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:46,040
Well, if you're going to go,
it's the best way to go, I suppose.

1171
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:51,320
<i>- Are you scared of death?
- No, I'm not scared of death.</i>

1172
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:53,960
I'm scared of dying. That's why I woke up.

1173
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
<i>- Oh, when did you wake up?
- A long time ago.</i>

1174
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:57,440
<i>- Who set the alarm?
- I did.</i>

1175
01:13:57,480 --> 01:13:59,760
<i>- I opened my eyes and I saw.
- And what did you see?</i>

1176
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:03,600
You can laugh while Rome is burning,
but believe you me, Poppy, it is burning.

1177
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:07,440
And if you don't wake up,
then you will be burnt to a cinder.

1178
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:12,720
<i>I mean, look around you. What do you see?
Do you see happiness?</i>

1179
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:16,280
Do you see a policy of bringing
happiness to people? No. No.

1180
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:18,160
You see ignorance and fear.

1181
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:21,000
You see... You see the disease
of multiculturalism,

1182
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:22,640
and what is multiculturalism?

1183
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:24,880
Multiculturalism is non-culturalism.

1184
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:26,720
And why do they want non-culturalism?

1185
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:29,200
Because they want to reduce collective will.

1186
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:30,800
The American Dream never happened.

1187
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:32,680
The American nightmare is already here.

1188
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:34,160
Look at the Washington Monument.

1189
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:37,800
It is 555 feet above the ground
and 111 feet below the ground.

1190
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:41,720
555 plus 111 is 666.

1191
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:44,600
666, Poppy. 666.

1192
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:51,440
<i>Keep to the left of the centre of the road.</i>

1193
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:53,920
Are you an only child, Scott?

1194
01:14:57,680 --> 01:15:01,280
Enrahah. Use all your mirrors.

1195
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:03,240
Watch your speed.

1196
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:23,040
Same time next week?

1197
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:26,560
- Of course.
- Of course.

1198
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:32,120
Stay happy.

1199
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:52,480
- Oh, come on, Suzy.
- Don't worry, she'll be here.

1200
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:54,440
What time's Helen expecting us?

1201
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:57,600
- She wanted us there by four.
- She's going to go nuts.

1202
01:15:57,640 --> 01:16:00,680
Not much I can do about that. Runs in the family.

1203
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:02,280
How was your lesson?

1204
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:06,520
I don't know. Dark.

1205
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:10,000
- How do you mean, dark?
- Dark as the night.

1206
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:13,440
He hasn't been feeling you up, has he?

1207
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:15,320
I'd like to see him try.

1208
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:18,400
<i>Touching your knee instead of the gear stick,
that old chestnut.</i>

1209
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:20,160
No.

1210
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:22,240
You all right, Poppy?

1211
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:26,480
Yeah. I think I'm just worried about Helen.

1212
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:28,800
Really, how do you mean?

1213
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:31,600
- Should have gone to see her ages ago.
- Yeah, families, eh?

1214
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:33,320
<i>Oh, here's Suzy.</i>

1215
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:34,040
Here we are.

1216
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:47,840
- Hello!
- Are you all right?

1217
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:50,800
Look at this! Oh, mind the tree.

1218
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:54,000
- It's nice to stand up.
- All right, Poppy?

1219
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:56,840
<i>- All right, Jamie?
- Suzy, mind your sister's new motor.</i>

1220
01:17:56,920 --> 01:17:58,680
<i>- You all right, Jamie?
- All right?</i>

1221
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:00,560
- Yeah.
- Long time no see.

1222
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:02,880
- Yeah, long time no see.
- All right, Suzy?

1223
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:04,840
<i>- All right, Jamie?
- All right.</i>

1224
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:07,240
Ooh, these are for you.

1225
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:11,920
- I got you a little bottle of bubbly.
- Oh, thank you very much. It's lovely.

1226
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:15,920
- All right. I'll pop these upstairs for you.
- Lovely, Jamie. Thank you very much.

1227
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:18,760
- Isn't that lovely?
- I'm guessing we're having a barbecue.

1228
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,720
Whatever gave you that idea, Suze?

1229
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:23,960
- Keep on running, Jamie.
- Yeah.

1230
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,200
Better put these down now, shall I?
That's a good idea. Having fun yet?

1231
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:29,040
<i>- Yeah.
- Take your shoes off, Suzy.</i>

1232
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:30,960
<i>- All right!
- And you too, Poppy.</i>

1233
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,840
I'll give you the grand tour.
This is the downstairs toilet.

1234
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:36,080
- Oh, I thought it was the wine cellar.
- I wish.

1235
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:38,800
Through here, this is the living room.

1236
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:42,160
Ta-da! Yeah, went with
a blue and silver theme in here.

1237
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:44,240
Did you, Jamie? It's very nice, isn't it, Suze?

1238
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:46,240
- Here's our dining area.
- Lovely.

1239
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:49,440
There's usually another chair here.
But we put it outside for later.

1240
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:50,680
- For the foxes?
- Yeah!

1241
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:53,320
- We only got it last weekend, didn't we?
- Yeah, flat pack.

1242
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:54,400
Really?

1243
01:18:57,320 --> 01:19:01,400
It's beautiful, Helen.
Haven't you got green fingers, eh?

1244
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:03,560
<i>- Is it all right to smoke, Helen?
- I suppose so.</i>

1245
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:05,680
Can you get the ash in the ashtray, please?

1246
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:07,240
<i>I'll try not to miss the potty.</i>

1247
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:09,320
<i>- You've been trained.
- Come and see my roses!</i>

1248
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:12,320
- Oh, lovely.
- I only planted these this time last year.

1249
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:14,480
- You didn't.
- They've done really well.

1250
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:16,560
I want to grow them into a big bush.

1251
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:18,320
- They smell lovely.
- Don't they just.

1252
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:20,080
My lavender. Put that by the compost.

1253
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:23,600
- Best place for it, really.
- Hydrangeas need perking up a bit.

1254
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:25,160
Bit down in the dumps, is he?

1255
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:27,600
Hello there, cheer up. Might never happen.

1256
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:30,280
Busy Lizzies are doing very well.
Beautiful flowers.

1257
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:33,200
- Been a bit busy, has she?
- Going to plant more of these next year.

1258
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:35,240
- That looks crap.
- Thanks, Suzy.

1259
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:37,160
- Eucalyptus.
- Oh, Zoe.

1260
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:39,080
Gum tree!

1261
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:41,560
- Brings back memories, doesn't it?
- Yeah, the smell.

1262
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:43,280
G'day, blue, how's it going?

1263
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:46,120
- Drinks up.
- Cheers, Jamie. Let me give you a hand.

1264
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:48,680
- Cheers, everyone.
- Cheers.

1265
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,480
So, you've spoken to Mum, then?

1266
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:54,760
Yeah, I spoke to her last Sunday. She's all right.

1267
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,760
- Lovely. She coming down?
- Yes.

1268
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:58,640
What's she coming down with? Syphilis?

1269
01:19:58,680 --> 01:20:01,120
- When did you last speak to her, Suzy?
- Oh, leave it out.

1270
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:03,120
- You should give her a ring.
- I spoke to her.

1271
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:04,920
- They're very excited.
- Course they are.

1272
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:06,520
They'll come down when the baby's born.

1273
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:09,920
- Get on with the in-laws, do you, Jamie?
- Yeah, I do, as it goes.

1274
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:13,200
- Yeah, you get on with Dad, don't you?
- We have a nice chat from time to time.

1275
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:15,280
- Do you?
- That's more than we ever do.

1276
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:17,760
Does it seem funny,
your little sister having a baby?

1277
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:20,480
- Yeah, it is a bit weird.
- No, it's perfectly natural.

1278
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:22,560
- I'm an auntie.
- Oh, yeah?

1279
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:25,200
- Got two nieces. My brothers' kids.
- They're lovely.

1280
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:28,040
- Yeah, well, they're all right.
- Oh, he's kicking.

1281
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:32,680
Oh, yeah, that's amazing. Hello,
little man in there. It's your auntie speaking.

1282
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:35,600
There's your other auntie here, Auntie Suzy.
Does she want a word?

1283
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:38,480
- What are you going to call it?
- Yeah, have you chosen a name yet?

1284
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:41,360
- We weren't going to say, were we?
- We're not telling anyone yet.

1285
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:43,840
- Go on, your secret's safe with us.
- No, it's bad luck.

1286
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:45,240
It's Nathan.

1287
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:47,720
Oops. It's lovely.

1288
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:49,600
- Nathan?
- Yeah.

1289
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:52,560
- It's a lovely name, Helen.
- Is there a Nathan in the family?

1290
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:55,440
- No.
- No, just feels right to us.

1291
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:57,480
Well, that's the important thing.

1292
01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:00,480
- Nathan Lightfoot.
- Yes, Suzy, Nathan Lightfoot.

1293
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:02,160
Nathan Lightfoot Esquire.

1294
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:04,080
- It's boring.
- Take no notice of her.

1295
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:06,320
- I'm not.
- Cheers. Cheers, Nathan.

1296
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:10,280
- Let me get you another top up. Suzy?
- Oh, yeah, thanks, Jamie.

1297
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:17,040
I know, let's have a go on your PlayStation,
Jamie.

1298
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:18,280
<i>- Yeah.
- Yeah.</i>

1299
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:20,560
- Yeah, I'll start it up.
- No, Jamie.

1300
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:23,360
- Zoe's favourite, isn't it?
- Yeah, I can't get enough.

1301
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:27,200
- What games you got?
- Sonic The Hedgehog, Splinter Cell.

1302
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:29,000
<i>- Cool.
- We can't start with that now.</i>

1303
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:30,320
- Why not?
- It's too late.

1304
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:31,880
Is it? What's the time?

1305
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:33,800
<i>- Oh, five minutes.
- No.</i>

1306
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:36,120
<i>- Come on, let's play.
- Jamie, I said leave it.</i>

1307
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:38,080
- All right, lovely.
- Sit down.

1308
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:40,040
Oh, for fuck sake.

1309
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:50,160
Bane of my life, PlayStations.

1310
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:52,160
- Oh, you got one?
- No, the kids at school.

1311
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:54,480
They're like that under the desks, aren't they?

1312
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:56,680
- I always confiscate them in my class.
- Do you?

1313
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:58,720
<i>- What a surprise.
- They must love that.</i>

1314
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:02,280
- Well, maybe in the morning, eh?
- Yeah, before we go for a walk.

1315
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:07,080
It's incredible to think
I'm going to get even bigger.

1316
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:09,760
- Only 10 more weeks.
- Exciting, strap yourself in.

1317
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:12,600
Doesn't it make you both feel
a little bit broody, you girls?

1318
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:16,080
- No, actually. How about you, Zoe?
- Afraid not. With all due respect.

1319
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:18,000
You want a baby, though, don't you, Poppy?

1320
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:21,160
- No, thanks. I've just had a kebab.
- I didn't mean that. Eventually.

1321
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:22,480
Maybe. Who knows?

1322
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:24,640
At 35, you're considered a high-risk mum.

1323
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:27,800
- Give me a chance, I've just turned 30.
- It's only five years away.

1324
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:30,440
- You've got to make plans.
- A five-year plan? Like Stalin?

1325
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:33,400
- When are you getting on the property ladder?
- I need a step up first.

1326
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:36,400
- You got to get yourself a mortgage.
- We don't want the hassle.

1327
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:39,720
- You need to invest your savings.
- I just stuff mine under the mattress.

1328
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:42,320
- Have you got a pension yet?
- You got to be joking.

1329
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:45,080
- Have you got a pension?
- We've both got pensions, haven't we?

1330
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:47,880
- Oh, yeah.
- Great. Where are your Zimmer frames?

1331
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:49,960
- You've got to take life seriously.
- Have I?

1332
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:53,000
You can't get drunk every night, partying,
however much fun it is.

1333
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:55,040
I don't get drunk every night. Do we?

1334
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:58,320
- No, she's an adult now, your big sister.
- Unfortunately.

1335
01:22:58,360 --> 01:23:01,080
- You have to take responsibility, Poppy.
- OK, take it easy.

1336
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:03,200
I am taking it easy.

1337
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:05,000
I just want you to be happy, that's all.

1338
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:06,440
I am happy.

1339
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:08,120
- I don't think you are.
- I am.

1340
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:12,360
I love my life. Yeah, it can be tough at times.
That's part of it, isn't it?

1341
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:16,880
I've got a great job, brilliant kids, lovely flat.
I've got her to look at.

1342
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:21,600
I've got amazing friends. I love my freedom.
I'm a lucky lady, I know that.

1343
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:24,280
- All right, no need to rub it in.
- What am I rubbing in?

1344
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:26,240
- I know what you're saying.
- What?

1345
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:28,240
- You think I've taken the easy option.
- Hey.

1346
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:29,800
Hang on, Helen. She didn't say that.

1347
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:32,360
<i>- It's what she meant.
- No, you're insecure about your life.</i>

1348
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:34,200
- All right, Suze.
- That's not true.

1349
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:36,920
- Why are you trying to control everyone?
- I'm not. I'm not.

1350
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:38,720
- Whatever. You're boring me.
- Leave it out.

1351
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:40,880
Why are you all attacking me? It's not fair.

1352
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:44,760
- No-one's attacking you, Helen.
- They're not attacking you, Hel.

1353
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:47,880
<i>- Blimey.
- It's pathetic.</i>

1354
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:50,480
- Suzy!
- Sorry.

1355
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:52,720
<i>- She'll be all right in a minute.
- Yeah.</i>

1356
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:56,120
It's hormones.

1357
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:01,840
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1358
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:07,680
- Do you want to play a game, Jamie?
- Yeah, yeah.

1359
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:10,320
No, best leave it till the morning.

1360
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:13,040
I think we should all go to bed, it's getting late.

1361
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:14,200
All right, then.

1362
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:16,920
Jamie, go upstairs
and get the bedding for Suzy.

1363
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:20,560
<i>- You're looking tired, Suzy.
- She always looks like that.</i>

1364
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:22,320
It's just my face.

1365
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:24,160
Thanks for the barbecue, Helen. Jamie.

1366
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:26,320
<i>- Anytime.
- It was gorgeous.</i>

1367
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:27,240
Thanks.

1368
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:30,080
<i>We'll go for a walk by the sea tomorrow.
It'll be lovely.</i>

1369
01:24:30,120 --> 01:24:31,480
<i>Be nice.</i>

1370
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:38,760
Move your arse.

1371
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:45,000
Flap, flap, flap!

1372
01:24:48,240 --> 01:24:50,600
Careful, Poppy.
I'm worried about you in those shoes.

1373
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:53,600
- Don't worry. They're not too high.
- Poppy, come off the wall.

1374
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:55,560
Give us a piggy back?

1375
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:05,760
Suzy, don't do that. Don't. Stop it.

1376
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:19,120
You should have told me,
I wouldn't have got on your back.

1377
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:32,720
I'm all right. How are you? Good weekend?

1378
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:36,400
Oh, heavy night last night, was it?

1379
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:40,120
That's what I like to hear. Good boy.

1380
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:44,200
<i>So, do you fancy going out sometime, then?</i>

1381
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:47,880
<i>How's Friday looking for you?
Think you can squeeze me in?</i>

1382
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:53,520
Oh, go on, then. I don't drink.

1383
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:56,120
But...

1384
01:25:56,160 --> 01:25:58,080
Yeah, maybe just the one.

1385
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:01,000
Yeah, something like that.

1386
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:06,800
All right, then.
See you then, then, then, then, then.

1387
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:12,480
All right. See you, sailor. Bye.

1388
01:26:35,880 --> 01:26:36,680
Scott!

1389
01:26:56,120 --> 01:26:58,240
Suzy, wind your sister's window up.

1390
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:27,160
What was that all about, then?

1391
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:29,120
Search me.

1392
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:30,920
Bit weird.

1393
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:32,880
Isn't it just?

1394
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:37,040
- Gives me the creeps, to be honest.
- Yeah.

1395
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:43,040
So, what are we doing for tea, then?

1396
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:45,120
- Takeaway. What do you reckon?
- Chinese?

1397
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:47,200
Oh, hello, look who's here. Little piglet.

1398
01:27:47,240 --> 01:27:48,440
- Are you paying?
- No.

1399
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,840
- Course she's not.
- Don't worry, we'll take care of it.

1400
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:52,640
- Mum and Dad.
- Which one am I?

1401
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:55,040
- Dad, of course.
- I hate being Dad.

1402
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:57,720
- You love it.
- Oh, get off, Poppy.

1403
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:05,360
It's a beautiful sky.

1404
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:24,320
There you go.

1405
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:26,080
Thanks.

1406
01:28:29,640 --> 01:28:31,840
So where were we?

1407
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:34,920
What brings you here?

1408
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:37,200
- I met a girl.
- Oh, very nice.

1409
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:38,920
- Yeah.
- What's she like, then?

1410
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:40,480
- I can't talk about it.
- Why not?

1411
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:42,560
- It's a secret.
- I'm good with secrets.

1412
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:45,760
- It's between me and her, though.
- Oh, fair enough. I won't pry.

1413
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:47,920
- Who is she?
- I couldn't possibly.

1414
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:50,320
Trust me.

1415
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:52,960
She's a teacher.

1416
01:28:54,360 --> 01:28:56,400
- Is she?
- She's gorgeous.

1417
01:28:56,440 --> 01:28:59,240
Oh... I hate her already.

1418
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:02,600
Haven't you got lovely eyes?

1419
01:29:04,280 --> 01:29:06,280
- Thanks.
- Beautiful colour.

1420
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:07,600
- Really?
- Yeah.

1421
01:29:07,640 --> 01:29:09,000
Picked them myself.

1422
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:10,640
- Did you?
- Yeah.

1423
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:12,200
- Where from?
- Down the market.

1424
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:14,160
- You're joking me?
- No.

1425
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:16,400
I'd say you got yourself a bargain there.

1426
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:19,880
- You've got one as well.
- Have I? Just the one? Which one?

1427
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:21,200
- That one.
- This one?

1428
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:23,120
- Particularly lovely, is he?
- He is.

1429
01:29:23,160 --> 01:29:24,680
But don't upset the other one.

1430
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:26,080
- No, she's all right.
- Is she?

1431
01:29:26,120 --> 01:29:28,040
- Yeah, we've had a chat about it.
- Oh, good.

1432
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:31,600
Yeah, she's over the worst now.
Yeah, anyway she's got other talents.

1433
01:29:31,640 --> 01:29:32,680
- Has she?
- Yeah.

1434
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:34,760
- What are they?
- So many.

1435
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:36,560
- She can juggle.
- Obviously.

1436
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:39,680
Yeah, goes without saying.
She can wink on demand.

1437
01:29:39,720 --> 01:29:41,280
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

1438
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:44,040
- Let's see.
- Are you sure?

1439
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:46,160
- Yeah.
- It's pretty spooky.

1440
01:29:46,200 --> 01:29:48,480
- Go on.
- OK, are you ready?

1441
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:50,440
Yeah.

1442
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:52,200
She is good!

1443
01:29:53,160 --> 01:29:55,600
- This one tries to join in.
- Don't let him.

1444
01:29:55,680 --> 01:29:57,400
I won't. Anyway, he's lovely, so...

1445
01:29:57,440 --> 01:30:00,640
- Well, she's lovely, too.
- Don't try and claw your way out of it.

1446
01:30:00,680 --> 01:30:02,520
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

1447
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:05,200
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1448
01:30:05,240 --> 01:30:06,280
Again.

1449
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:14,920
This is nice.

1450
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:18,880
It is nice.

1451
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:52,240
Here we are.

1452
01:30:55,960 --> 01:30:57,680
Wow.

1453
01:30:57,720 --> 01:30:59,760
Welcome to my humble abode.

1454
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:01,560
Thank you.

1455
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:29,320
- Aren't you high up?
- Yeah.

1456
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:32,800
Yeah. What's it like up there?

1457
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:34,800
Hm. It's OK.

1458
01:31:37,720 --> 01:31:39,640
That's better.

1459
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,720
- I think you must be too hot.
- Yeah, it does feel hot.

1460
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:55,600
Yeah, I thought so.

1461
01:31:55,640 --> 01:31:57,560
Usually right.

1462
01:31:59,480 --> 01:32:02,320
- Though it's not really my job.
- No, you're very good at it.

1463
01:32:02,360 --> 01:32:04,560
I know.

1464
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:06,720
Hidden talents.

1465
01:32:09,160 --> 01:32:11,080
Oh, wow.

1466
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:15,000
Now, that's what I call a bargain.

1467
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:17,160
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1468
01:32:21,720 --> 01:32:24,000
One, two, three.

1469
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:26,840
- I'm a bit hot, too.
- Yeah?

1470
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:27,840
Yeah.

1471
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:30,960
- Maybe this'll help.
- I think you might be right.

1472
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:34,600
- What about if this...
- Oh, yeah, and that one. Go on, then.

1473
01:32:34,680 --> 01:32:35,600
OK.

1474
01:32:35,640 --> 01:32:38,440
Ooh, I quite like it like that.

1475
01:32:40,440 --> 01:32:41,560
- Oh!
- Lovely.

1476
01:32:43,640 --> 01:32:46,000
- What's it like in there?
- Oh, not bad.

1477
01:33:33,640 --> 01:33:35,480
I'll go and make that tea.

1478
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:37,240
Great.

1479
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:03,120
Going to be late for my lesson.
Hey-ho. There you go.

1480
01:34:03,160 --> 01:34:05,200
- I'll give you a lift.
- Will you?

1481
01:34:05,240 --> 01:34:06,280
- Yeah.
- Oh!

1482
01:34:06,360 --> 01:34:09,080
- Means I keep you for longer.
- Thank you very much.

1483
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:11,040
It's OK.

1484
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:15,360
- So when you coming back to school?
- Oh. Next week.

1485
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:19,160
- I'll see how things go with his mum.
- Yeah, he'll be all right.

1486
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:21,120
He'll be fine.

1487
01:34:28,640 --> 01:34:30,360
Hello.

1488
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:31,440
Hi.

1489
01:34:44,360 --> 01:34:47,760
Are you happy... in your life?

1490
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:52,080
That's a big question.

1491
01:34:54,040 --> 01:34:55,560
Isn't it just?

1492
01:35:20,440 --> 01:35:23,440
- So, you play football, then?
- Yeah, five-a-side every week.

1493
01:35:23,480 --> 01:35:25,760
- Right. Is that indoors or outdoors?
- No, outdoors.

1494
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:27,760
- Oh, here she is.
- Made it. Just.

1495
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:31,920
- Why aren't you wearing any jewellery?
- Oh, it's that kind of day.

1496
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:34,640
So, you doing anything tonight?

1497
01:35:34,680 --> 01:35:36,880
Yeah, it's a mate's 30th.
We're all meeting in a bar.

1498
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:38,720
- Great.
- What are you two up to?

1499
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:40,640
<i>- Oh, cinema.
- Yeah, see a film.</i>

1500
01:35:40,680 --> 01:35:42,720
<i>- Popcorn...
- Sit in the dark, hold hands.</i>

1501
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:44,080
Yeah, no necking.

1502
01:35:44,120 --> 01:35:46,040
She's only saying that cos you're here.

1503
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:47,760
Normally I'm all over her like a rash.

1504
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:50,000
- I don't blame you.
- He's a right smoothie.

1505
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:51,760
Isn't he just?

1506
01:35:51,800 --> 01:35:53,360
- Here he is.
- Nice to meet you.

1507
01:35:53,400 --> 01:35:55,200
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, Zoe.

1508
01:35:55,240 --> 01:35:57,360
<i>- Yeah, whatever.
- Have a good time tonight.</i>

1509
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:00,800
<i>Come on, you.</i>

1510
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:06,160
Hiya, Scott. This is Tim.
He's coming with us today.

1511
01:36:06,240 --> 01:36:08,120
- Just joking.
- Hi.

1512
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:12,440
- Ooh, can't win them all.
- Apparently not.

1513
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:14,000
- See you later.
- I'll call you.

1514
01:36:14,040 --> 01:36:15,240
- Will you?
- Yeah.

1515
01:36:15,320 --> 01:36:16,440
Good.

1516
01:36:30,760 --> 01:36:33,960
What happened on Sunday, Scott?
You should've stopped to say hello.

1517
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,960
I don't know what you're talking about.
I was in Stevenage on Sunday.

1518
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,280
Stevenage? Funny, you must have a twin.

1519
01:36:39,320 --> 01:36:42,040
I was there all day. I was looking after
my mum. My aunt's dying.

1520
01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:44,520
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- It's all right.

1521
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:48,560
- Don't believe you, Scott.
- It's up to you, I was there till midnight.

1522
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:50,520
Don't think so, gigolo.

1523
01:37:08,280 --> 01:37:10,920
<i>Concentrate, Poppy.
Concentrate. Watch what I'm doing.</i>

1524
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:14,640
Now I'm going to indicate. I keep in lane.
In a roundabout, you keep in lane.

1525
01:37:14,720 --> 01:37:16,760
OK? You keep in lane, all right?

1526
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:21,720
<i>You take responsibility for other drivers
and for yourself and you keep in lane, OK?</i>

1527
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:24,560
This is a roundabout. Concentrate,
pay attention. Good. Thank you.

1528
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:27,040
Are you... Was that a request
or was that a demand?

1529
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:29,520
Did he bully me then? Did he just shove in then?

1530
01:37:29,560 --> 01:37:31,080
<i>- Or did he ask?
- Did he?</i>

1531
01:37:31,120 --> 01:37:33,560
No, he didn't ask.
You see what roundabouts do?

1532
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:37,480
Roundabouts, if you keep in lane
and you keep going, you'll be fine.

1533
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:40,320
You're following rules and keeping
everything the way it should be.

1534
01:37:40,360 --> 01:37:41,560
<i>Everything in check.</i>

1535
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:44,800
<i>But if you get selfish and if you
step out of it, then it goes wrong.</i>

1536
01:37:44,840 --> 01:37:47,280
And it gets dangerous.
Do you see what I mean?

1537
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:54,160
Waa-aaah...

1538
01:37:54,200 --> 01:37:57,200
I'm not waiting for somebody
who can't keep in lane on a roundabout.

1539
01:37:57,240 --> 01:37:58,640
I'm not waiting.

1540
01:37:58,680 --> 01:38:00,640
<i>Everywhere you see, look at the cameras.</i>

1541
01:38:00,680 --> 01:38:02,960
Everywhere you go, they're watching you.

1542
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,520
They're seeing you. They're watching.
Everywhere you go.

1543
01:38:05,560 --> 01:38:08,800
Look at this place, it stinks.
Come on. What are you waiting for?

1544
01:38:08,840 --> 01:38:12,320
<i>- All right.
- Jesus Christ! Look, another camera...</i>

1545
01:38:12,360 --> 01:38:14,160
Speed camera. Why do you need them?

1546
01:38:14,200 --> 01:38:16,560
There's two guys at the back of the road
selling drugs

1547
01:38:16,600 --> 01:38:19,600
<i>and you have a speed camera.
Why do you need a speed camera?</i>

1548
01:38:19,640 --> 01:38:21,080
You can wait.

1549
01:38:21,120 --> 01:38:22,480
- You can wait!
- Easy.

1550
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:28,960
<i>Come on! Drive the car.</i>

1551
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:32,360
You're not driving a camel.
OK? This is not a bazaar.

1552
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:35,360
We have rules in this country.
We have regulations. Keep to them.

1553
01:38:38,840 --> 01:38:40,760
Fucking morons!

1554
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:03,440
Check your mirrors, your seat,
make yourself comfortable.

1555
01:39:03,480 --> 01:39:05,160
- No, I don't think so.
- Seat belt on.

1556
01:39:05,200 --> 01:39:07,120
- I'm not going anywhere.
- What do you mean?

1557
01:39:07,160 --> 01:39:08,960
You are in no fit state to take this lesson.

1558
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,120
I am the instructor. You are the pupil.

1559
01:39:11,160 --> 01:39:12,720
- You need to calm down.
- I am calm.

1560
01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:15,440
- You can't drive like this.
- You can't comment on my driving!

1561
01:39:15,480 --> 01:39:19,160
I think I can when you're putting yourself
in danger, putting me in danger,

1562
01:39:19,200 --> 01:39:21,760
- and putting other people in danger.
- It's them.

1563
01:39:21,800 --> 01:39:24,720
That's bullshit. It's all bullshit.
That's it, I don't want it.

1564
01:39:24,760 --> 01:39:26,640
- You want this lesson to stop?
- Yes, I do.

1565
01:39:26,680 --> 01:39:29,200
I don't want you to teach me any more. I'm sorry.

1566
01:39:29,240 --> 01:39:32,320
OK. Fantastic. Get in the passenger seat
and I'll drive you home.

1567
01:39:32,360 --> 01:39:34,120
No, I don't think so. I'm driving.

1568
01:39:34,160 --> 01:39:35,360
- No, you're not.
- I am.

1569
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:37,520
Poppy, if this isn't a lesson, you can't drive.

1570
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:38,960
You're not driving anywhere.

1571
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,440
You got two choices,
either I drive you home or you walk.

1572
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:43,760
I don't mind walking, but you can't drive this car.

1573
01:39:43,800 --> 01:39:46,800
- You can't stop me.
- Yes, I can.

1574
01:39:47,800 --> 01:39:49,800
- Poppy, give me the keys.
- No.

1575
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:52,280
- Give me the keys to my car.
- No, I don't think so.

1576
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:55,440
I'm going to ask you one more time.
Please give me the keys to my car.

1577
01:39:55,480 --> 01:39:57,920
- I'm sorry, I can't.
- Give me the fucking keys to my car,

1578
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,440
- you fucking bitch!
- Get off me!

1579
01:39:59,480 --> 01:40:03,640
- Give me the... fuck...
- Get off me. Get off me!

1580
01:40:03,680 --> 01:40:06,320
- Give me the fucking...
- Get off me. You get away from me!

1581
01:40:06,360 --> 01:40:09,680
- Give me the fucking keys!
- You can't touch me, Scott.

1582
01:40:09,720 --> 01:40:12,680
- Give me the fucking keys!
- You can't touch me. You're out of order.

1583
01:40:12,720 --> 01:40:15,600
- Give me those fucking keys!
- You're out of order.

1584
01:40:15,640 --> 01:40:17,240
- You're out of order.
- Give me the...

1585
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:20,360
I'm calling the police.
Do you want me to call the police?

1586
01:40:21,720 --> 01:40:23,000
Do you?

1587
01:40:26,040 --> 01:40:29,720
Right. So let's just calm down, shall we?

1588
01:40:32,360 --> 01:40:35,600
OK, we're disturbing the peace here.

1589
01:40:40,120 --> 01:40:42,800
I just want to get in my car and drive away.

1590
01:40:42,840 --> 01:40:44,560
<i>- That's not going to happen.
- Jesus!</i>

1591
01:40:44,600 --> 01:40:48,280
You're doing it again. You never give in
for fuck's sake, you fucking bitch!

1592
01:40:48,360 --> 01:40:50,000
- You need help.
- Don't patronise me.

1593
01:40:50,040 --> 01:40:53,480
<i>- I'm not patronising you.
- Yes, you are always patronising me.</i>

1594
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:56,520
<i>This is what you always wanted,
what you set out to achieve.</i>

1595
01:40:56,560 --> 01:40:57,960
<i>This is the game you play.</i>

1596
01:40:58,640 --> 01:41:02,160
You prodded me. You poked me.
You stroked me. You teased me.

1597
01:41:02,200 --> 01:41:04,200
You flirted with me. You sucked me in.

1598
01:41:04,240 --> 01:41:07,600
<i>You wore your high-heel boots,
your short skirt, your low-cut top</i>

1599
01:41:07,640 --> 01:41:09,760
and you flashed your tits, you tossed your hair.

1600
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:12,680
You played with the gear stick. You lied to me!

1601
01:41:12,720 --> 01:41:16,840
<i>This is all about you.
The world has to revolve around you.</i>

1602
01:41:18,680 --> 01:41:22,200
I'm a driving instructor.
I just wanted to do my job.

1603
01:41:22,240 --> 01:41:26,240
You had no intention of learning how to drive.
You had one thing in mind.

1604
01:41:26,280 --> 01:41:30,320
To reel me in. And why?
Because you have to be adored.

1605
01:41:30,360 --> 01:41:33,200
<i>You've got to be wanted. And you drink it in.</i>

1606
01:41:33,240 --> 01:41:35,880
<i>And you leave me with a spring in your step</i>

1607
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:39,280
and you go off and you fuck your boyfriend
and you fuck your girlfriend.

1608
01:41:39,320 --> 01:41:43,000
And you all drive around
in that stupid, little yellow car.

1609
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:53,760
Scott...

1610
01:42:01,480 --> 01:42:03,480
Come on, now.

1611
01:42:12,200 --> 01:42:14,480
I just want to go home.

1612
01:42:16,520 --> 01:42:17,800
<i>I'm sure you do.</i>

1613
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:20,920
Don't we all, eh?

1614
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:28,800
Tell you what.

1615
01:42:30,840 --> 01:42:33,120
Why don't we have a talk about it?

1616
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:41,200
We'll sit in the car.

1617
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:43,960
We'll have a chat, OK?

1618
01:42:46,120 --> 01:42:48,040
All right?

1619
01:42:50,840 --> 01:42:53,040
And then I'll give you your keys.

1620
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:25,040
I'm sorry if I upset you, Scott.

1621
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:32,920
I wish I could make you happy.

1622
01:43:35,080 --> 01:43:37,000
<i>I was happy.</i>

1623
01:43:39,320 --> 01:43:40,840
OK.

1624
01:43:43,680 --> 01:43:45,720
And I was in Stevenage last Sunday.

1625
01:43:48,160 --> 01:43:50,440
<i>- Sure.
- You can ask my mum.</i>

1626
01:43:57,800 --> 01:43:59,920
So, same time next week?

1627
01:44:15,800 --> 01:44:17,680
I'm sorry, Scott.

1628
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:25,880
There you go.

1629
01:44:29,040 --> 01:44:30,800
I'll just get my bag, all right?

1630
01:44:38,120 --> 01:44:39,880
I'm a good driving instructor.

1631
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,280
Yeah, I know you are.

1632
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:56,320
Take care, Scott.

1633
01:44:58,200 --> 01:45:00,080
Was that your boyfriend?

1634
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:05,960
Before?

1635
01:45:10,080 --> 01:45:11,800
Was it?

1636
01:47:47,160 --> 01:47:49,360
I think I should give up smoking.

1637
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:51,880
That's a good idea.

1638
01:47:51,960 --> 01:47:53,880
What can I give up?

1639
01:47:54,560 --> 01:47:56,920
You could give up being too nice.

1640
01:47:58,200 --> 01:48:00,560
Seriously, you can't make everyone happy.

1641
01:48:00,600 --> 01:48:04,440
There's no harm in trying, though, is there?
Bring a smile to the world.

1642
01:48:05,400 --> 01:48:07,840
- Come on, Poppy.
- I know. I know.

1643
01:48:09,240 --> 01:48:11,440
I still think we should call the police.

1644
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:13,560
No, that's not going to help him, is it?

1645
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:15,960
I don't know.

1646
01:48:16,520 --> 01:48:18,640
- You know what?
- What?

1647
01:48:18,680 --> 01:48:20,960
- We're lucky, aren't we?
- Yeah, we are.

1648
01:48:22,280 --> 01:48:25,000
Well... well, you make your own luck in life,
don't you?

1649
01:48:25,040 --> 01:48:28,040
Well, some of us do.
Some of us miss the boat completely.

1650
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:30,240
It's hard work being a grown-up, isn't it?

1651
01:48:30,280 --> 01:48:33,080
Yeah, it is. It's a long trip.

1652
01:48:33,120 --> 01:48:35,040
Yeah, tell me when we get there.

1653
01:48:35,960 --> 01:48:38,240
Don't worry, I'll let you know.

1654
01:48:40,360 --> 01:48:44,040
You keep on rowing and I'll keep on smiling.

1655
01:48:44,080 --> 01:48:46,000
Hm. Are we there yet?

1656
01:48:48,720 --> 01:48:50,640
We've got a hell of a way to go.

1657
01:48:58,480 --> 01:49:01,440
We're getting good at this, aren't we?
Nothing to it.

1658
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:16,880
Hello, you. Missing me already?

1659
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,040
Oh...

1660
01:49:19,080 --> 01:49:21,040
That's nice to hear.

1661
01:49:22,840 --> 01:49:24,760
A nightmare. Yeah.

1662
01:49:25,560 --> 01:49:27,760
I'm still alive... just.

1663
01:49:29,160 --> 01:49:31,600
Well... it's a long story.

1664
01:49:31,680 --> 01:49:34,040
I'm on the lake, with Zoe.

1665
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:36,360
Yeah.

1666
01:49:36,440 --> 01:49:38,640
The bathroom flooded, yeah.

1667
01:49:38,680 --> 01:49:40,880
It's all right now. We've found a boat.

1668
01:49:40,920 --> 01:49:44,320
You're
funny.

1669
01:49:49,400 --> 01:49:51,520
No.
