1
00:00:21,442 --> 00:00:22,588
Thanks.

2
00:00:43,046 --> 00:00:43,995
Here.

3
00:00:45,574 --> 00:00:46,916
Sorry.

4
00:00:54,022 --> 00:00:57,406
- That was quick.
- I sat next to the wrong person.

5
00:00:57,992 --> 00:01:02,433
- Really? Where?
- Don't look! Don't look!

6
00:01:02,536 --> 00:01:04,227
Careful of my jacket.

7
00:01:42,798 --> 00:01:44,226
Will the wedding be crowded?

8
00:01:44,974 --> 00:01:46,184
I don't know.

9
00:01:47,342 --> 00:01:49,830
I don't think
she knows anyone anymore.

10
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:52,331
She's only known this guy a year.

11
00:01:53,006 --> 00:01:54,054
Is that short?

12
00:01:54,287 --> 00:01:56,524
Would you marry someone
you'd only known a year?

13
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:01,164
I can't say I have a lot of hope
for the whole thing.

14
00:02:03,055 --> 00:02:04,485
Then why are we going then?

15
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:07,984
- We're supporting her.
- I thought she wasn't speaking to you.

16
00:02:08,146 --> 00:02:09,454
No.

17
00:02:10,224 --> 00:02:12,330
I wasn't speaking to her, but I'm over it.

18
00:02:14,194 --> 00:02:15,917
I'm never getting married.

19
00:02:43,445 --> 00:02:45,301
Why aren't you wearing
your new shades?

20
00:02:45,942 --> 00:02:47,437
I don't think I need them right now.

21
00:02:47,702 --> 00:02:49,492
You begged for those glasses.

22
00:02:58,648 --> 00:03:00,054
You look very cool.

23
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,422
I don't need them right now.

24
00:03:11,993 --> 00:03:13,368
Do they know we're here?

25
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:16,177
Yes.

26
00:03:31,132 --> 00:03:32,081
Are you...

27
00:03:32,188 --> 00:03:35,866
Paul apologizes for not coming.
She's still getting the house ready.

28
00:03:36,893 --> 00:03:39,129
I'm sorry it was such short notice.

29
00:03:39,229 --> 00:03:42,164
I don't care.
Paul's frantic, but I don't give a shit.

30
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:45,787
And Ingrid wants me to tell you
that she made us all bracelets.

31
00:03:45,886 --> 00:03:47,130
No, I said we should wait.

32
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:51,771
I thought you asked me to tell them.
Anyway, I got Knicks colors.

33
00:03:51,871 --> 00:03:53,245
They're not Knicks colors!

34
00:03:53,343 --> 00:03:54,904
It's beautiful, Ingrid.

35
00:03:55,424 --> 00:03:57,911
- Where's your dad and Josh?
- They might come later.

36
00:03:58,015 --> 00:04:01,431
Josh's spring break is next week,
and then Jim teaches through Friday.

37
00:04:01,536 --> 00:04:03,806
Then he opens the house
in Vermont on the weekend.

38
00:04:04,225 --> 00:04:06,232
It means a lot to Pauline that you came.

39
00:04:06,753 --> 00:04:07,702
Good.

40
00:04:08,353 --> 00:04:11,321
Holy Jesus! Watch it, dicksack!

41
00:04:12,738 --> 00:04:13,686
God!

42
00:04:16,034 --> 00:04:17,922
If you're wondering about
the mustache...

43
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:18,967
No, I wasn't.

44
00:04:19,075 --> 00:04:21,410
I had a full beard for a while,
and then when I shaved it

45
00:04:21,507 --> 00:04:24,890
I left this part for last, you know,
to see how it looked.

46
00:04:25,444 --> 00:04:26,372
And...

47
00:04:27,172 --> 00:04:28,283
It's meant to be funny.

48
00:04:39,365 --> 00:04:40,893
You're so handsome.

49
00:04:47,239 --> 00:04:48,961
I never thought I'd get you here.

50
00:04:55,048 --> 00:04:56,509
You're arriving in the midst of a drama.

51
00:04:56,616 --> 00:04:58,918
Ingrid, would you make sure
Wizard's inside?

52
00:04:59,015 --> 00:04:59,997
It's the Voglers.

53
00:05:00,104 --> 00:05:02,276
The neighbors want us
to cut down our tree.

54
00:05:02,377 --> 00:05:04,199
No. That's our tree.

55
00:05:04,297 --> 00:05:06,403
They think it's sick
and rotting their property.

56
00:05:06,505 --> 00:05:07,912
We're having the ceremony under it.

57
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:09,438
You took the swing down.

58
00:05:09,546 --> 00:05:12,645
Pauline thinks this is their way
of trying to be friends.

59
00:05:14,026 --> 00:05:17,256
I think they resent us because we're...

60
00:05:17,354 --> 00:05:18,980
I don't know what we are.

61
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,567
- This is my room.
- Okay.

62
00:05:31,052 --> 00:05:33,987
- Do you like showers or baths?
- Showers. What about you?

63
00:05:34,093 --> 00:05:35,107
I don't care.

64
00:05:35,213 --> 00:05:36,675
Is Malcolm what you thought he'd be?

65
00:05:37,198 --> 00:05:39,653
- I didn't know what to...
- The mustache is temporary.

66
00:05:39,757 --> 00:05:41,449
He saved it for last
when he was shaving.

67
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,794
It's meant to be funny.

68
00:05:42,894 --> 00:05:44,071
- He told me.
- Yeah.

69
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:46,439
I'm sorry, with so little time to prepare,

70
00:05:46,543 --> 00:05:48,909
we had to put you in
Malcolm's storage room.

71
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:52,487
This was Becky's room. Poor Becky.

72
00:05:52,656 --> 00:05:55,077
Poor Becky.
Well, now it's a storage room.

73
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,179
I've just started to feel like it's our house
and not my parents', you know.

74
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,393
Our parents.

75
00:06:00,496 --> 00:06:02,123
Of course.

76
00:06:02,224 --> 00:06:04,200
Sorry, it might still smell like paint.

77
00:06:04,305 --> 00:06:05,767
I thought he was a musician.

78
00:06:05,873 --> 00:06:08,972
Well, music's officially a hobby.
He's painting now,

79
00:06:09,074 --> 00:06:11,692
and writing letters to newspapers
and magazines.

80
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:13,162
He's very meticulous.

81
00:06:13,266 --> 00:06:16,114
He'll spend up to a week
writing a response to a music review.

82
00:06:16,498 --> 00:06:21,355
He's incredibly smart. Maybe too smart.
I don't know. We're doing very well.

83
00:06:22,068 --> 00:06:24,785
Good. I mean, you must be.

84
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,682
I don't know where to begin.
What can I tell you?

85
00:06:31,669 --> 00:06:34,352
It seems I'm pregnant,
but it's really early,

86
00:06:34,453 --> 00:06:36,820
so I haven't told anyone.
I mean, I haven't told Malcolm or Ingrid.

87
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:38,227
- Wow.
- What did you say?

88
00:06:38,325 --> 00:06:39,274
I said wow.

89
00:06:39,381 --> 00:06:43,310
Yeah. If it sticks. We'll see. I hope so.

90
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:44,974
Things are good.

91
00:06:45,078 --> 00:06:48,591
We did a couples' seminar
two months ago or so in Maine.

92
00:06:48,695 --> 00:06:50,321
They give you exercises
and things to do.

93
00:06:50,424 --> 00:06:53,741
I know you're not convinced,
but we got engaged right afterwards.

94
00:06:54,168 --> 00:06:57,135
The guy who runs it, Strickland,
he wrote this really interesting book,

95
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,128
On Loving,
which l'll lend you if you want.

96
00:06:59,224 --> 00:07:00,152
Okay.

97
00:07:00,248 --> 00:07:01,459
But only if you'll read it.

98
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,535
Because I need it back.
I made notes in the margins.

99
00:07:03,705 --> 00:07:05,331
I may not get to it for a while.

100
00:07:05,433 --> 00:07:07,856
Well, I'm not going to lend it to you
if you're not going to read it.

101
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:10,384
It's gonna be very informal, by the way.

102
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:12,912
Just Mom and Becky,
Malcolm's brother,

103
00:07:13,018 --> 00:07:16,368
a few friends, and now you and Claude.
Nothing like the first one.

104
00:07:16,474 --> 00:07:17,652
Becky's coming?

105
00:07:17,787 --> 00:07:19,445
- Yeah.
- Could I have some...

106
00:07:19,995 --> 00:07:20,859
You go.

107
00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:22,962
I was just going to say
could I have some white wine?

108
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:24,955
Oh, yeah. We have...

109
00:07:27,357 --> 00:07:30,357
I'm really glad you changed your mind
and came.

110
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:33,942
I never heard from you after I sent
the invite. I even wondered if you got it.

111
00:07:34,044 --> 00:07:35,539
I'm just so pleased that we're here.

112
00:07:35,773 --> 00:07:36,701
Did you get it?

113
00:07:36,797 --> 00:07:38,292
Yeah.

114
00:07:38,398 --> 00:07:39,706
I'm sorry you were so angry.

115
00:07:39,805 --> 00:07:41,977
I wasn't angry. I was disappointed.

116
00:07:42,078 --> 00:07:43,834
But you see,
when you say disappointed,

117
00:07:43,934 --> 00:07:45,877
it puts me in a crummy situation,
like I let you down.

118
00:07:45,983 --> 00:07:48,186
- Well, you did, in a way.
- No, I don't see it like that.

119
00:07:48,288 --> 00:07:49,782
Fine. I felt betrayed. Is that word okay?

120
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:51,132
Again, you're making me the aggressor.

121
00:07:51,231 --> 00:07:53,206
You were the aggressor.

122
00:07:53,312 --> 00:07:54,872
Listen, let's not...

123
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,004
I've become a really good cook.

124
00:08:04,354 --> 00:08:07,202
I can't believe you've still got
all of our old records.

125
00:08:07,297 --> 00:08:10,232
- Mom, can you hide this, please?
- Yeah, of course.

126
00:08:10,338 --> 00:08:12,378
Malcolm played with Ric Ocasek once.

127
00:08:12,483 --> 00:08:14,305
Yeah, in the late '80s.

128
00:08:14,403 --> 00:08:17,153
After he left The Cars. It was a solo gig.

129
00:08:17,251 --> 00:08:18,658
So you're kind of famous?

130
00:08:18,755 --> 00:08:23,099
No, no, believe me, I'm not.
I used to want to be, but no.

131
00:08:23,204 --> 00:08:24,152
Do you want to be famous?

132
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,203
Claude wants to be very famous.

133
00:08:26,308 --> 00:08:29,156
Well, make sure you can
handle rejection. I can't.

134
00:08:30,245 --> 00:08:32,830
For me, expectation just
turns to disappointment.

135
00:08:32,933 --> 00:08:34,843
So ultimately, I'd rather not try.

136
00:08:35,173 --> 00:08:36,286
Claude, ignore him.

137
00:08:36,677 --> 00:08:38,980
It'll all go black for us
soon enough, anyway.

138
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,279
When your mother moved to New York,

139
00:08:41,382 --> 00:08:43,237
she used to send me
books and records.

140
00:08:43,335 --> 00:08:45,342
- She sent me R.E.M.'s Murmur.
- And the Pixies.

141
00:08:45,446 --> 00:08:49,157
And X. She was very cool, your mother.

142
00:08:49,832 --> 00:08:53,280
- You only liked Top 40.
- That's true. But I love R.E.M. Now.

143
00:08:54,985 --> 00:08:57,156
I don't really listen to music anymore.

144
00:08:57,257 --> 00:09:00,257
I was dating that guy Horace back then.
Do you remember him?

145
00:09:01,097 --> 00:09:02,886
Was that the guy
that liked to rough you up?

146
00:09:02,985 --> 00:09:04,708
No, that was our dad.

147
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:07,941
Our dad used to strip down to
his skivvies and beat us with a belt.

148
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:09,797
That man had a sexual screw loose.

149
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:11,938
That's awful that stuff
that happens to kids.

150
00:09:12,042 --> 00:09:14,214
Malcolm was fondled
by a male babysitter.

151
00:09:14,315 --> 00:09:16,322
Just use that information
however you want.

152
00:09:16,427 --> 00:09:18,794
I'm sorry, we're with family. I figured...

153
00:09:21,036 --> 00:09:22,825
I think Becky got it the worst.

154
00:09:22,924 --> 00:09:25,444
Did she ever.
Raped by the horse trainer.

155
00:09:37,934 --> 00:09:40,837
Alan rolled over in bed and he looked
at me and he said, "I can't feel my face."

156
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:44,071
It took three doctors before
we knew it was Bell's Palsy.

157
00:09:44,239 --> 00:09:46,628
They say a brush of wind can do it.

158
00:09:46,735 --> 00:09:48,230
Feeling is slowly coming back.

159
00:09:48,496 --> 00:09:51,311
We're all getting older, which is terrible.

160
00:09:51,408 --> 00:09:55,205
I don't care how universal it is.
I can't remember names anymore.

161
00:09:55,313 --> 00:09:58,990
I have that.
I blank out on certain words now, too.

162
00:09:59,088 --> 00:10:02,220
The other day I couldn't remember
the word for...

163
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:07,406
I've forgotten it again. The stuff in wine.
What is it? Sediment. That's it.

164
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:08,652
I know that. I was talking more about

165
00:10:08,754 --> 00:10:11,210
not remembering who was
the bassist for M? Tley Cr¨¹e.

166
00:10:11,347 --> 00:10:14,194
Ingrid. Why don't you show Claude
and Bruce the game trunk?

167
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:15,218
Okay.

168
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:16,657
Mick Mars.

169
00:10:24,596 --> 00:10:27,116
Toby, I think you need to have
Bruce diagnosed.

170
00:10:28,469 --> 00:10:30,477
Margot, I don't wanna have
this conversation with you.

171
00:10:31,093 --> 00:10:33,963
It's vital. If you keep telling him
he's like everyone else,

172
00:10:34,069 --> 00:10:36,787
he's gonna wonder why he isn't.
He's suffering.

173
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,788
He's tested very well.
He does B's in school.

174
00:10:39,894 --> 00:10:41,389
But that's how autism works.

175
00:10:41,495 --> 00:10:44,212
One part of the brain can be fine,
and then the other part is damaged.

176
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,311
We've had him diagnosed, Margot.
Nothing was found wrong.

177
00:10:47,415 --> 00:10:49,074
Did you really, though?

178
00:10:49,591 --> 00:10:52,941
I'm not gonna have this conversation.
I'm sorry.

179
00:10:54,649 --> 00:10:58,293
I know this must be so difficult for you,
but you have to...

180
00:11:00,153 --> 00:11:01,135
What are you doing?

181
00:11:01,241 --> 00:11:02,768
I left you a note.

182
00:11:02,873 --> 00:11:03,954
Come back.

183
00:11:05,306 --> 00:11:07,248
Or meet me in Vermont on Saturday.

184
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:11,348
No. No. The wedding is on Saturday.

185
00:11:11,451 --> 00:11:14,353
I'm here for that. I can't pull out.
How would that look?

186
00:11:15,867 --> 00:11:17,722
You haven't spoken to her in years.

187
00:11:17,819 --> 00:11:22,327
Well, we're speaking now.
She is my closest friend, despite it all.

188
00:11:22,428 --> 00:11:24,436
You were the one that kept trying
to get me to call her.

189
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,264
Did you tell Claude what you're doing?

190
00:11:27,165 --> 00:11:30,067
Jim, this guy, Malcolm,

191
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:35,795
he's exactly what you'd imagine,
except I think he's clinically depressed.

192
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:41,597
He's not ugly.
He's just completely unattractive.

193
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,605
He has no job.

194
00:11:43,711 --> 00:11:46,679
Best I can make out is
he's a letter writer. I don't know.

195
00:11:47,296 --> 00:11:50,776
And the house looks weird to me.
She's trying too hard.

196
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:53,370
It's all kind of a mess.

197
00:11:55,616 --> 00:11:58,005
They took down the swing.

198
00:11:58,945 --> 00:11:59,893
Hello?

199
00:12:00,001 --> 00:12:03,384
You said you weren't 100% on this.
You said that like a week ago.

200
00:12:03,714 --> 00:12:04,642
Can I come up there?

201
00:12:04,738 --> 00:12:08,601
No. I don't want to see you.
I feel happier already having done it.

202
00:12:08,866 --> 00:12:12,163
Please, don't tell Claude anything,
please, until we've talked more.

203
00:12:12,259 --> 00:12:15,129
This is happening, and you need
to get your mind around that.

204
00:12:16,804 --> 00:12:19,739
- Are you asleep?
- Yes.

205
00:12:22,084 --> 00:12:24,605
- Will you remember this?
- Yeah.

206
00:12:27,236 --> 00:12:28,862
I just talked to your dad.

207
00:12:30,981 --> 00:12:33,316
I'm only going to tell you
if you won't remember.

208
00:12:35,015 --> 00:12:36,062
Okay.

209
00:12:40,455 --> 00:12:43,422
Everyone finds you so funny
and charming.

210
00:12:43,527 --> 00:12:45,633
I always get compliments about you.

211
00:12:47,303 --> 00:12:50,620
Are you having fun?
Is it nice to see Pauline?

212
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:54,623
- Yeah, I really like her.
- Yeah, she is crazy, though.

213
00:12:54,728 --> 00:12:57,795
- In what way?
- She's really berserk.

214
00:12:58,312 --> 00:13:00,200
Maybe it's the hormones.

215
00:13:00,938 --> 00:13:03,273
You didn't notice anything
different about Pauline?

216
00:13:03,945 --> 00:13:06,848
- No.
- She's pregnant. She told me.

217
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:11,110
She's keeping it a secret
from Malcolm and even Ingrid,

218
00:13:11,211 --> 00:13:13,447
which I think is unforgivable.

219
00:13:14,699 --> 00:13:16,838
Now she's gonna have to marry him.

220
00:13:17,356 --> 00:13:18,763
What's she planning on doing,
getting married

221
00:13:18,859 --> 00:13:22,057
and not drinking champagne?
Then she's just gonna be lying.

222
00:13:22,957 --> 00:13:25,739
I guess she's afraid she'll miscarry.
She probably will.

223
00:13:26,189 --> 00:13:28,131
I think on some level,
she's ambivalent about the marriage.

224
00:13:28,237 --> 00:13:29,896
That's why she's not telling him.

225
00:13:31,789 --> 00:13:33,416
Are you stoned, Mom?

226
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,549
Maybe a little.

227
00:13:37,711 --> 00:13:38,988
I don't like it.

228
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:45,384
My scrotum is longer than my penis.

229
00:13:49,359 --> 00:13:51,334
It's sweet how Claude looks up to me.

230
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,870
Margot doesn't seem as crazy
as you made her out to be.

231
00:13:56,978 --> 00:14:00,043
What she did to Alan and Toby tonight
didn't seem crazy enough for you?

232
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:02,736
I guess that seemed pretty crazy.

233
00:14:02,834 --> 00:14:04,295
Well, she cares deeply.

234
00:14:04,402 --> 00:14:06,672
Yeah, she's really worried about Bruce.

235
00:14:07,059 --> 00:14:10,987
This has nothing to do with Bruce.
She thinks everyone is autistic.

236
00:14:13,523 --> 00:14:14,472
What?

237
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,041
Nothing.
You keep changing your position.

238
00:14:16,148 --> 00:14:18,187
I'm just trying to figure out
if I should agree with you or not.

239
00:14:18,292 --> 00:14:20,681
Well, can't she be both?
Care deeply and be crazy?

240
00:14:20,788 --> 00:14:22,828
I mean, do people have to be
all one thing?

241
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,134
- I guess not.
- Well, okay then.

242
00:14:26,517 --> 00:14:28,972
It is nice she came for the wedding.

243
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:30,964
She's so pretty, don't you think?

244
00:14:32,053 --> 00:14:35,120
- She's attractive.
- A little thin, maybe.

245
00:14:36,439 --> 00:14:37,813
But it is nice she came.

246
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:41,203
Let's fuck.

247
00:15:11,227 --> 00:15:12,339
Fuck it!

248
00:15:13,372 --> 00:15:14,321
Claude!

249
00:15:14,427 --> 00:15:16,850
I knew I could be friends with him

250
00:15:17,404 --> 00:15:18,745
Good go.

251
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,053
Honey, you're up.

252
00:15:29,214 --> 00:15:32,596
Claude, don't just whack it.
Think about it before you hit.

253
00:15:33,342 --> 00:15:34,357
Sorry.

254
00:15:36,094 --> 00:15:37,142
Good.

255
00:15:38,143 --> 00:15:39,071
Paul, what are you doing?

256
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:40,312
I'm sending Claude's ball
into the bushes.

257
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:41,343
Take the extra hit.

258
00:15:41,439 --> 00:15:43,327
- I don't want to do that.
- It's the smarter play.

259
00:15:44,096 --> 00:15:47,479
Pauline! I told you, you can't!
Your feet are too small.

260
00:15:47,968 --> 00:15:49,462
You took the awnings down.

261
00:15:59,137 --> 00:16:00,086
Yes!

262
00:16:01,473 --> 00:16:02,619
Okay.

263
00:16:16,068 --> 00:16:18,107
- Well done.
- Fuck you.

264
00:16:22,116 --> 00:16:23,361
Come on, Claude.

265
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,688
Honey, you're going the wrong way.

266
00:16:36,199 --> 00:16:37,541
So stupid.

267
00:16:37,638 --> 00:16:39,843
Mom, I'm sorry. Jesus.

268
00:16:42,087 --> 00:16:45,862
This is why I hate games.
I hate what it does to me.

269
00:16:47,495 --> 00:16:49,439
Wait! We're not finished yet!

270
00:16:51,017 --> 00:16:51,999
Malcolm?

271
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:57,445
Have you ever noticed how Pauline
sometimes can't make eye contact?

272
00:16:59,882 --> 00:17:01,987
How her gaze hovers
just above your head?

273
00:17:03,179 --> 00:17:04,869
I think I know what you mean.

274
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:07,174
I always think
that I have something in my hair.

275
00:17:08,331 --> 00:17:11,462
It's not necessarily bad, Paul.
It's just something that you do.

276
00:17:14,828 --> 00:17:18,024
Claude, have you ever seen
your mother climb a tree?

277
00:17:18,508 --> 00:17:19,457
No.

278
00:17:19,565 --> 00:17:21,507
We don't have much opportunity
in Manhattan.

279
00:17:21,996 --> 00:17:24,582
As kids, Margot climbed everything.

280
00:17:24,685 --> 00:17:26,114
She could even climb that tree.

281
00:17:26,222 --> 00:17:27,683
Can you do it, Mom?

282
00:17:29,294 --> 00:17:31,149
- Maybe later.
- No, now.

283
00:17:31,246 --> 00:17:33,548
- Do it now, Margot.
- Show him, Margot.

284
00:18:02,067 --> 00:18:03,344
I told you.

285
00:19:27,998 --> 00:19:29,013
Shit.

286
00:19:30,078 --> 00:19:31,737
What's she doing now?

287
00:19:32,831 --> 00:19:34,237
She's stuck.

288
00:19:44,096 --> 00:19:45,209
You okay?

289
00:19:45,632 --> 00:19:46,647
I got it.

290
00:19:55,585 --> 00:19:57,341
You were great on the way up.

291
00:19:57,697 --> 00:20:01,560
- Don't patronize me, Claude.
- Come on, we're all laughing, Margot!

292
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:02,975
You're laughing in a kind way.

293
00:20:03,075 --> 00:20:04,734
Claude is taking
too much pleasure out of it.

294
00:20:04,835 --> 00:20:06,395
- I am not.
- You are.

295
00:20:06,499 --> 00:20:09,795
You like to make fun of me,
to see me get embarrassed.

296
00:20:09,891 --> 00:20:11,004
It's mean.

297
00:20:14,308 --> 00:20:17,724
- What are you doing?
- I've got a fucking bug in my ear, okay?

298
00:20:18,501 --> 00:20:22,146
I thought Claude could hand out
programs. Ingrid wants to sing.

299
00:20:22,437 --> 00:20:24,096
Do you want to read a poem
or something?

300
00:20:24,197 --> 00:20:26,587
You know I don't like
to speak in front of people.

301
00:20:27,622 --> 00:20:30,589
I'm doing this conversation
at the bookstore in town on Friday.

302
00:20:30,694 --> 00:20:32,964
I totally regret having said I'd do it.

303
00:20:33,318 --> 00:20:34,977
You're doing a conversation?

304
00:20:35,623 --> 00:20:38,493
Yeah. Just talking about my work
in front of a crowd.

305
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,739
I would have invited you,
but I thought it'd be boring.

306
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,382
What? Say it.

307
00:20:45,641 --> 00:20:47,975
Nothing. It's just, I would come.
I wanna come.

308
00:20:48,073 --> 00:20:49,250
I get a kick out of it.

309
00:20:49,353 --> 00:20:53,630
Just, it's weird, you know.
So you're not here for my...

310
00:20:55,626 --> 00:20:58,758
It's okay. I get it.
When did they ask you?

311
00:20:59,498 --> 00:21:03,176
A while ago. I said no, but then
when I was coming here anyway,

312
00:21:03,275 --> 00:21:05,348
I guess it helps sales. And so...

313
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:08,804
I see.

314
00:21:10,411 --> 00:21:12,353
Did I tell you Becky got her tubes tied?

315
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:17,670
Why? Is she seeing someone?
She's still obese, I assume.

316
00:21:17,773 --> 00:21:19,147
I think it's symbolic.

317
00:21:19,245 --> 00:21:20,903
I bet Mom paid for it.

318
00:21:21,005 --> 00:21:23,624
- We should audit Mom.
- I considered it in my 20s.

319
00:21:23,726 --> 00:21:26,345
You know, when I was fucking everyone.
You remember?

320
00:21:26,446 --> 00:21:29,480
- I did my share.
- Not like me.

321
00:21:30,158 --> 00:21:31,403
You wanna count?

322
00:21:32,463 --> 00:21:34,251
No, Margot. I don't wanna count.

323
00:21:35,374 --> 00:21:38,223
What was it about Dad
that had us fucking so many guys?

324
00:21:39,823 --> 00:21:42,279
I think it was the only time
we could really feel unselfconscious

325
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:43,759
and get out of our heads.

326
00:21:44,432 --> 00:21:45,610
I don't think it was that.

327
00:21:45,713 --> 00:21:47,567
I just think it was something
we were good at.

328
00:21:47,665 --> 00:21:49,487
Your mom thinks Bruce is gay.

329
00:21:49,585 --> 00:21:53,098
No, she said he had Asperger's.
It's like lesser-retarded.

330
00:21:53,969 --> 00:21:57,614
- I have adult A.D.D.
- You mean child A.D.D.

331
00:21:57,746 --> 00:22:00,202
No. For some reason
I have the adult version.

332
00:22:00,306 --> 00:22:01,484
Maybe I'm retarded.

333
00:22:01,587 --> 00:22:03,180
- Come on!
- Come on!

334
00:22:03,283 --> 00:22:05,804
- Hey! Be careful!
- What?

335
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:07,696
Be careful how you pull on
that child's arm.

336
00:22:07,796 --> 00:22:09,039
You'll take it out of its socket.

337
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:11,082
Don't tell us how to treat our child.

338
00:22:11,188 --> 00:22:13,709
I don't care how you treat your child.
Just don't hurt him.

339
00:22:13,813 --> 00:22:15,951
- It's a girl.
- She threw a rock at me.

340
00:22:16,245 --> 00:22:17,260
She's a little girl.

341
00:22:17,364 --> 00:22:20,747
She knew what she was doing.
There's no hitting in our family.

342
00:22:20,852 --> 00:22:22,064
Do you understand?

343
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:24,236
Stay out of it, bitch.

344
00:22:24,917 --> 00:22:26,325
That was the Voglers.

345
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,402
Jesus, Margot, what are you doing?
They already hate us.

346
00:22:28,502 --> 00:22:31,350
Don't you tell me what I can
and can't do. That is child abuse.

347
00:22:31,447 --> 00:22:32,855
Mom, she was psychotic.

348
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:34,958
Stop picking on me, everyone.

349
00:22:41,209 --> 00:22:42,452
Oh, God.

350
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:50,547
It could be anyone's.

351
00:22:52,953 --> 00:22:54,361
What are they gonna do to us?

352
00:22:54,457 --> 00:22:55,919
They're not going to do anything, honey.

353
00:22:56,923 --> 00:22:58,417
We have to cut down the tree.

354
00:22:58,522 --> 00:22:59,767
You should have seen
that woman's face.

355
00:22:59,866 --> 00:23:01,175
Margot completely set her off.

356
00:23:01,275 --> 00:23:02,997
Where are we gonna get married then?

357
00:23:03,451 --> 00:23:05,426
We'll get married
in the fucking driveway if we have to.

358
00:23:05,532 --> 00:23:07,092
Your mom started a war.

359
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,082
We have to make sure we wear shoes,

360
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,035
because they might
start throwing glass.

361
00:23:11,773 --> 00:23:15,733
- Has that happened before?
- I can't remember. I think so.

362
00:23:16,477 --> 00:23:19,227
No, it definitely has. Now I remember.

363
00:23:21,757 --> 00:23:24,659
- Where you going?
- To town. L'll be back for dinner.

364
00:23:24,766 --> 00:23:27,548
Come on, Margot, nobody blames you.

365
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:37,371
- Is that Dick Koosman?
- Yeah. He has a house up here.

366
00:23:38,112 --> 00:23:41,113
- What's he doing with Mom?
- Good question.

367
00:23:46,209 --> 00:23:48,827
Dick and his daughter asked us over
to swim tomorrow.

368
00:23:49,505 --> 00:23:51,000
We didn't invite them to the wedding.

369
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:52,859
You're not really friends.

370
00:23:52,962 --> 00:23:56,923
We're friends enough that it's awkward.
Maisy baby-sits for us all the time.

371
00:23:57,026 --> 00:23:59,262
He's doing the interview with me
in town on Friday.

372
00:23:59,363 --> 00:24:01,981
Did I tell you he and I are collaborating
on a screenplay?

373
00:24:02,212 --> 00:24:03,968
An adaptation of one of Dick's novels.

374
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:06,272
No, I didn't even know you knew
he was up here.

375
00:24:06,371 --> 00:24:09,121
Is he even a good writer?
Why do people care about him?

376
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,333
You're competitive with everyone.

377
00:24:10,436 --> 00:24:12,641
It doesn't even matter
if they do the same thing as you.

378
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,399
He's competitive with Bono.

379
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,289
It's true. I don't subscribe to the credo

380
00:24:16,389 --> 00:24:18,723
that there's enough room
for everyone to be successful.

381
00:24:18,822 --> 00:24:20,283
I think there are only
a few spots available,

382
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:22,943
and people like Dick Koosman
and Bono are taking them up.

383
00:24:23,334 --> 00:24:25,244
Malcolm, what would ever make
you think that's something

384
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:26,724
to draw right now?

385
00:24:27,527 --> 00:24:28,476
Sorry.

386
00:24:30,566 --> 00:24:32,639
I wasn't thinking about it. Sorry, Margot.

387
00:24:33,575 --> 00:24:34,688
You found it.

388
00:24:34,791 --> 00:24:36,701
- Hi!
- Hey, Maisy.

389
00:24:39,336 --> 00:24:40,962
Thank you, Pauline.

390
00:24:42,025 --> 00:24:43,847
- Hi.
- How are you?

391
00:24:44,777 --> 00:24:46,402
- What's up?
- I don't wanna do this.

392
00:24:46,505 --> 00:24:48,577
- Come on, don't be that way.
- No, I'm not being that way.

393
00:24:48,681 --> 00:24:50,373
I just don't feel like it.

394
00:24:51,338 --> 00:24:54,469
I'm gonna go back and...
I have work to do.

395
00:24:54,569 --> 00:24:56,064
Dick doesn't care
that you don't make any money.

396
00:24:56,171 --> 00:24:58,626
Is that what you... That's not why.

397
00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:01,960
I just hate swimming. I really hate it.
It's disgusting to me.

398
00:25:02,059 --> 00:25:04,033
My mistake was saying
I would do it to begin with.

399
00:25:04,139 --> 00:25:05,285
You have fun.

400
00:25:05,739 --> 00:25:07,146
Fine. We'll have fun.

401
00:25:12,013 --> 00:25:13,387
People always pee in the pool.

402
00:25:13,484 --> 00:25:15,274
I don't think Dick and Maisy pee
in their pool.

403
00:25:15,373 --> 00:25:17,479
L'll bet you $500 there's pee in that pool.

404
00:25:17,869 --> 00:25:19,779
To the end and back.
Claude, you say go.

405
00:25:19,886 --> 00:25:21,675
Okay. Go!

406
00:25:24,783 --> 00:25:26,408
- How's your dad?
- Good.

407
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:29,228
He and I shared a thesis advisor
at Stanford. Did you know that?

408
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:30,276
No.

409
00:25:30,991 --> 00:25:32,879
I was dating your mom back then.
Did you know that?

410
00:25:32,975 --> 00:25:33,923
No.

411
00:25:41,969 --> 00:25:45,744
- Pauline wins! Mom cheated.
- I did not.

412
00:25:45,842 --> 00:25:47,565
You didn't touch the wall, Margot.

413
00:25:47,665 --> 00:25:50,700
It doesn't matter. Lost anyway.

414
00:25:50,802 --> 00:25:52,079
It was close.

415
00:25:55,314 --> 00:25:57,038
Maisy, aren't you going swimming?

416
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,698
Claude!

417
00:26:43,258 --> 00:26:44,664
Are you okay?

418
00:26:45,369 --> 00:26:46,678
I got him!

419
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:53,399
It's okay, baby.

420
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:06,457
- I'm sorry I laughed about the tree.
- Now we're even.

421
00:27:11,197 --> 00:27:13,564
- You've got a problem.
- What do you mean?

422
00:27:14,077 --> 00:27:15,124
I don't like the girl,

423
00:27:15,229 --> 00:27:17,172
and I don't like the way
Malcolm looks at her.

424
00:27:17,277 --> 00:27:18,357
Come on, it's sexy.

425
00:27:18,462 --> 00:27:20,797
No, you didn't see it.
I saw it. You've got a problem.

426
00:27:20,894 --> 00:27:22,520
I'm not worried.

427
00:27:23,743 --> 00:27:25,499
Maybe teach Claude how to swim.

428
00:27:26,303 --> 00:27:28,758
He won't want to do it. It's too late.

429
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:33,465
- Are you supposed to be doing that?
- No.

430
00:27:34,976 --> 00:27:38,271
I liked your last story. Was it Harper's?
The one about Mom.

431
00:27:38,369 --> 00:27:40,441
I was very... I liked it very much.

432
00:27:41,857 --> 00:27:44,857
- It wasn't really about Mom.
- I thought it was.

433
00:27:45,729 --> 00:27:48,413
Anyway. Why don't you want
Claude to know how to swim?

434
00:27:48,513 --> 00:27:51,612
I didn't say I didn't want him to.
Why do you care?

435
00:27:51,715 --> 00:27:53,023
It's not in his life. We're New Yorkers.

436
00:27:53,122 --> 00:27:55,195
If he wants to learn when he's older,
he can.

437
00:27:55,682 --> 00:27:57,624
I'm curious why you're so
interested in the whole thing.

438
00:27:57,731 --> 00:28:01,955
I'm not. It's just as a safety thing.
Forget it.

439
00:28:03,524 --> 00:28:05,017
It's interesting.

440
00:28:05,124 --> 00:28:07,426
This is the first time
Dick has invited us over.

441
00:28:07,941 --> 00:28:09,185
Are you really friends?

442
00:28:09,284 --> 00:28:11,324
Well, we're neighbors.
We employ Maisy.

443
00:28:11,429 --> 00:28:13,796
I mean, I don't care.
I just think it's interesting.

444
00:28:14,661 --> 00:28:18,437
Are you excited about the talk?
I'd like to come, if it's okay.

445
00:28:19,783 --> 00:28:23,045
My friend Blair asked me, "What's it like
to have a celebrity as a sister?"

446
00:28:23,142 --> 00:28:25,030
I said I've got no problem with celebrity.

447
00:28:25,126 --> 00:28:27,494
Alice Munro spoke at Bennington
and was sort of a friend of mine.

448
00:28:28,391 --> 00:28:30,628
- I'm not a celebrity.
- Well, you're well-known.

449
00:28:30,727 --> 00:28:33,794
- To a very few people.
- Just accept the compliment.

450
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,215
I guess I didn't realize
it was a compliment.

451
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:05,137
I know a girl from a Ionely street

452
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:08,271
Cold as ice cream, but still as sweet

453
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:11,602
Dry your eyes, Sunday girl

454
00:30:11,702 --> 00:30:15,564
Hey, I saw your guy with a different girl

455
00:30:15,669 --> 00:30:18,288
Looks like he's in another world

456
00:30:18,645 --> 00:30:21,329
Go on and hide, Sunday girl

457
00:30:22,038 --> 00:30:23,216
She can't catch up

458
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:24,497
Singing?

459
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,592
A bit.

460
00:30:29,815 --> 00:30:31,376
Can I make a suggestion?

461
00:30:33,143 --> 00:30:37,236
You should get underarm deodorant.
You kind of smell.

462
00:30:38,329 --> 00:30:40,467
Better I tell you than someone else.

463
00:30:44,057 --> 00:30:47,920
- I think you smell nice. You smell real.
- I stink.

464
00:30:49,243 --> 00:30:52,439
- It causes cancer.
- Underarm deodorant?

465
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:57,274
It's got chemicals and other things
which are extremely harmful.

466
00:30:57,627 --> 00:30:59,831
I'm not gonna die
from underarm cancer.

467
00:30:59,931 --> 00:31:03,095
No, you'll get it somewhere else,
like your stomach or your testicles.

468
00:31:04,124 --> 00:31:07,124
- Testicles?
- Don't laugh. It's a serious thing.

469
00:31:08,541 --> 00:31:10,232
Who told you about this anyway?

470
00:31:12,094 --> 00:31:14,483
- Maisy?
- Yeah.

471
00:31:16,126 --> 00:31:19,258
I hope you're not interested in that girl.
I find her insufferable.

472
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:20,630
What does that mean?

473
00:31:20,735 --> 00:31:23,550
It means I can't suffer her.
She's loud and stupid.

474
00:31:23,647 --> 00:31:26,494
And she goes on about things
of which she knows nothing about.

475
00:31:26,592 --> 00:31:28,152
She got into Harvard early.

476
00:31:28,255 --> 00:31:30,645
Stupid people get into Harvard early
all the time.

477
00:31:31,904 --> 00:31:34,687
- Where did you go again?
- Barnard.

478
00:31:38,049 --> 00:31:40,057
I just don't think
you should do anything with her.

479
00:31:40,161 --> 00:31:41,339
We're just friends.

480
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:45,368
If you do, use a condom.

481
00:31:45,474 --> 00:31:46,554
Where are you going?

482
00:31:46,659 --> 00:31:49,473
Out with Pauline and Malcolm and Dick.

483
00:31:51,939 --> 00:31:53,280
Are kids coming?

484
00:31:58,244 --> 00:31:59,421
Who do we know is gay?

485
00:31:59,523 --> 00:32:01,433
How do I know
what gay people you know?

486
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:05,501
- Alan and Toby.
- And Bruce. He's gay and Asperger's.

487
00:32:05,605 --> 00:32:09,086
- I don't know if Bruce is gay.
- He might be. It's very common.

488
00:32:10,405 --> 00:32:13,024
- Your mom's pregnant.
- No, she isn't.

489
00:32:13,542 --> 00:32:15,331
- She is.
- How do you know that, Claude?

490
00:32:15,429 --> 00:32:18,212
She told my mom. But you can tell.
She's hormonally weird.

491
00:32:18,566 --> 00:32:19,941
Holy shit, Ingrid.

492
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:22,210
You're gonna have
a baby sister or brother.

493
00:32:24,103 --> 00:32:26,787
My mom thinks your mom is unreliable.

494
00:32:27,624 --> 00:32:28,703
Who cares?

495
00:32:28,808 --> 00:32:30,914
- Do you think your mom is fuckable?
- I don't know.

496
00:32:31,016 --> 00:32:34,213
I think she's hot, your mother.
I'd do her if I was gay.

497
00:32:34,696 --> 00:32:36,704
I might anyway,
I mean, if she came on to me.

498
00:32:36,809 --> 00:32:38,052
She won't.

499
00:32:38,697 --> 00:32:40,290
I'm not gonna do anyone.

500
00:32:41,801 --> 00:32:44,103
- What was that?
- This is scary.

501
00:33:15,534 --> 00:33:17,422
Margot used to never speak.

502
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,974
I remember we went on a double date
in high school.

503
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:22,446
And that kid Ron asked
if English was your first language.

504
00:33:22,543 --> 00:33:25,860
It's true. I used to think
I had some kind of brain defect.

505
00:33:25,967 --> 00:33:28,684
- You thought you were aphasic.
- I'm still not sure.

506
00:33:28,784 --> 00:33:31,173
- Jesus, Margot.
- It's very possible, Paul.

507
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:34,127
It's just, your diagnoses sometimes irk
the hell out of me.

508
00:33:34,225 --> 00:33:36,974
- Malcolm, will you slow down?
- What?

509
00:33:37,074 --> 00:33:38,567
I can drive, if you like.

510
00:33:38,673 --> 00:33:41,325
Nah. You got the dinner.
The driving's on me.

511
00:33:41,426 --> 00:33:44,077
Well, l'll let you pay your half
if you slow down.

512
00:33:44,177 --> 00:33:46,829
Well, neither Pauline nor I
ordered dessert.

513
00:33:46,931 --> 00:33:48,687
Let it go, Malcolm.

514
00:33:48,786 --> 00:33:51,176
Margot would insist on driving,
if she knew how.

515
00:33:51,443 --> 00:33:53,417
My license elapsed, but I know how.

516
00:33:53,523 --> 00:33:57,747
It's probably for the best.
I have this theory. I think, historically,

517
00:33:57,844 --> 00:34:00,430
women have been held back in so many
ways that when they get power

518
00:34:00,532 --> 00:34:03,380
like they do behind the wheel,
they can't help but abuse it.

519
00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:06,381
It's akin to Hannah Arendt's
Eichmann theory about

520
00:34:06,485 --> 00:34:08,493
prison guards and prisoners
switching roles.

521
00:34:08,789 --> 00:34:12,270
- That's a charming philosophy.
- Yeah, tell that one a lot.

522
00:34:12,373 --> 00:34:14,960
This isn't a blanket thing.
I mean, women can be great drivers too.

523
00:34:15,062 --> 00:34:18,063
Said the man with the mustache
he thinks he's wearing in quotes.

524
00:34:18,774 --> 00:34:20,400
It's meant to be funny.

525
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:23,726
Are you doing this for her benefit
or for mine?

526
00:34:24,567 --> 00:34:26,608
- What the fuck?
- What?

527
00:34:26,711 --> 00:34:30,487
No, there they go. It's okay. I thought
I lost the brakes for a second there.

528
00:34:31,193 --> 00:34:32,337
- Malcolm!
- What?

529
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,896
- Watch it!
- It's fine, Margot!

530
00:34:35,224 --> 00:34:36,566
You're just so incompetent.

531
00:34:36,665 --> 00:34:39,861
Okay. Why don't you fucking
drive yourselves home?

532
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:45,519
God.

533
00:34:47,675 --> 00:34:49,050
You should go after her.

534
00:34:59,452 --> 00:35:01,241
Come home with me tonight.

535
00:35:02,909 --> 00:35:06,324
- I've got Claude.
- Come on.

536
00:35:06,685 --> 00:35:08,889
I've been trying to get you
up here all year.

537
00:35:10,877 --> 00:35:12,601
She's pregnant.

538
00:35:30,209 --> 00:35:33,111
- Why are you putting that there?
- I just wanna keep it.

539
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,376
I left a piece of skin
in a movie theater once.

540
00:35:36,481 --> 00:35:38,456
So it could watch movies all its life.

541
00:35:39,906 --> 00:35:42,841
- Are you obsessed with Maisy?
- No.

542
00:35:42,947 --> 00:35:45,085
You're always staring at her tits.

543
00:35:49,634 --> 00:35:52,930
- You have a mustache.
- My mom bleaches it.

544
00:35:57,253 --> 00:36:00,100
- Where are you going?
- You're starting to annoy me.

545
00:36:32,105 --> 00:36:33,414
What are you doing?

546
00:36:35,112 --> 00:36:38,528
- I didn't think you came home.
- Where would I be?

547
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:41,825
Can't Josh and Dad come
to the wedding?

548
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:44,584
I've been through this. Go to bed.

549
00:36:45,387 --> 00:36:46,761
Can I sleep in here?

550
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:48,647
No, honey.

551
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:50,917
We can put a pillow between us.

552
00:36:52,651 --> 00:36:55,881
Okay. Just for tonight.

553
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:25,834
When you were a baby,
I wouldn't let anyone else hold you.

554
00:37:25,936 --> 00:37:27,977
I think that may have been a mistake.

555
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,414
Why was it a secret?

556
00:37:30,512 --> 00:37:33,098
Because I didn't want you to get excited
before it was real.

557
00:37:33,617 --> 00:37:35,690
It's not really a baby yet.

558
00:37:35,793 --> 00:37:38,412
In two weeks
we can celebrate together, okay?

559
00:37:38,513 --> 00:37:40,140
Why did you tell Margot?

560
00:37:40,978 --> 00:37:43,149
Because she's my sister and I trust her.

561
00:37:44,306 --> 00:37:45,866
How do you feel about it?

562
00:37:46,547 --> 00:37:47,976
I don't want a sister.

563
00:37:49,588 --> 00:37:50,930
I'm gonna get Wizard.

564
00:37:55,957 --> 00:37:58,707
Margot told Claude something
I expressly told her in confidence.

565
00:37:58,804 --> 00:38:00,234
And he told Ingrid.

566
00:38:00,341 --> 00:38:03,189
I'm stunned that she put me in this
position. It's so fucking infuriating!

567
00:38:03,285 --> 00:38:05,741
- Well, it's one of those things...
- Don't say anything, okay?

568
00:38:05,846 --> 00:38:08,748
You know what?
Just be there for me silently.

569
00:38:08,853 --> 00:38:09,802
Okay.

570
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:11,794
Why do I have to be
so careful around her,

571
00:38:11,894 --> 00:38:14,033
but everyone is allowed
to make fun of me?

572
00:38:14,135 --> 00:38:17,234
- I don't think...
- Malcolm, what did I just say?

573
00:38:17,398 --> 00:38:20,945
I just need you to take my side.
I don't need you to make it better.

574
00:38:24,056 --> 00:38:25,682
Ingrid's really upset.

575
00:38:26,424 --> 00:38:29,773
Fuck! I can't believe
she put me in this position.

576
00:38:31,129 --> 00:38:33,169
I didn't tell you before because

577
00:38:33,273 --> 00:38:35,510
I didn't want you to feel like
you had to marry me.

578
00:38:36,089 --> 00:38:40,399
I found out right before our seminar
that I'm pregnant.

579
00:38:42,395 --> 00:38:45,435
Well? Does that sound good to you?

580
00:38:45,691 --> 00:38:49,553
I'm still digesting Margot telling Claude.
What a fucking nut job.

581
00:38:51,099 --> 00:38:53,783
Sorry. I think I'm really happy.

582
00:39:03,805 --> 00:39:05,845
Ingrid! Come here, honey.

583
00:39:49,539 --> 00:39:52,093
- Hey.
- Hey.

584
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:55,363
I'm just looking at Pauline's
incense and self-help books.

585
00:39:55,461 --> 00:39:56,704
I don't understand it.

586
00:39:56,805 --> 00:39:59,325
This junk makes her look stupid,
and she's not.

587
00:40:00,517 --> 00:40:02,306
I don't like to think of her this way.

588
00:40:02,981 --> 00:40:05,121
She is such a hypocrite.

589
00:40:05,222 --> 00:40:06,749
Somehow, I'm a kook
for going to therapy,

590
00:40:06,854 --> 00:40:10,203
yet she's got enough drugs here
to medicate an elephant.

591
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:13,825
- She's always with these losers.
- Malcolm's not a loser.

592
00:40:13,926 --> 00:40:16,479
- Claude, think about it.
- He's cool.

593
00:40:16,583 --> 00:40:18,111
What makes you think he's cool?

594
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:22,080
I'm more talking about her investment
in things like cults and ashrams.

595
00:40:22,184 --> 00:40:24,868
- She was in a cult?
- Years ago.

596
00:40:26,025 --> 00:40:29,986
She and Lenny also followed some guru
who was a follower of the Muktananda.

597
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,965
He made her drink his bath water.

598
00:40:33,705 --> 00:40:35,593
Who knows what she's doing now.

599
00:40:36,009 --> 00:40:37,351
Margot? Claude?

600
00:40:37,706 --> 00:40:39,713
- Wizard!
- Wizard!

601
00:40:39,818 --> 00:40:40,746
Wizard!

602
00:40:40,842 --> 00:40:43,112
- How long has he been gone?
- I don't know.

603
00:40:43,211 --> 00:40:45,732
Ingrid brought him in last night,
but we couldn't find him this morning.

604
00:40:45,835 --> 00:40:47,209
- Oh, boy.
- Wizard!

605
00:40:47,308 --> 00:40:48,868
Did you tell Claude I'm pregnant?

606
00:40:50,155 --> 00:40:52,327
- I don't know.
- You did.

607
00:40:52,684 --> 00:40:54,724
- Well, I guess I said something.
- You did.

608
00:40:54,829 --> 00:40:56,290
You don't have to tell him everything.

609
00:40:56,397 --> 00:40:59,147
He wants to know.
If I don't tell him, he figures it out.

610
00:40:59,245 --> 00:41:00,522
Mom, where's Wizard?

611
00:41:00,621 --> 00:41:02,247
I don't know, honey.

612
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:04,138
You didn't let him out
into the road or something

613
00:41:04,237 --> 00:41:05,645
where something could have
happened to him?

614
00:41:05,742 --> 00:41:09,158
Why would you think that's
something I would do? That's awful.

615
00:41:09,262 --> 00:41:12,612
I didn't mean on purpose. I just meant
maybe in case you knew something.

616
00:41:16,687 --> 00:41:20,299
- Sorry. I'm here.
- I didn't see you.

617
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,610
I'm just writing my vows.

618
00:41:21,712 --> 00:41:23,916
Trying to do something appropriate,
but also funny.

619
00:41:24,496 --> 00:41:26,700
Not jokey, more character-based humor.

620
00:41:28,305 --> 00:41:29,679
You having an okay time?

621
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,940
Yeah, besides Wizard getting out.

622
00:41:33,041 --> 00:41:35,408
Yeah. We'll find him.

623
00:41:36,306 --> 00:41:37,451
Or else, I don't know.

624
00:41:37,554 --> 00:41:38,633
- We won't.
- Right.

625
00:41:38,738 --> 00:41:40,462
Or else, he's dead or something.

626
00:41:41,619 --> 00:41:44,521
- It means a lot to Paul that you came.
- Yeah.

627
00:41:50,516 --> 00:41:53,865
That is the same toaster
we had here as kids.

628
00:41:53,972 --> 00:41:55,217
Paul is so weird.

629
00:41:56,693 --> 00:41:58,548
I hear you've heard the news.

630
00:41:58,996 --> 00:42:01,648
Yeah. Congratulations.

631
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:06,539
Pretty cool. Hard to fully take in.
It's still a little abstract.

632
00:42:07,126 --> 00:42:08,555
I haven't had that thing yet
where you realize

633
00:42:08,662 --> 00:42:11,313
that you're not the most important
person in the world.

634
00:42:13,879 --> 00:42:15,734
I'm anxious for that to happen.

635
00:42:16,856 --> 00:42:20,052
I guess I have to thank you.
I wouldn't know yet if you hadn't arrived.

636
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,218
You're welcome.

637
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:27,379
Of course I can't help but worry l'll pass
not-so-great genes on to the kid.

638
00:42:27,481 --> 00:42:29,652
I mean, in my family
there's a lot of hand washing, but...

639
00:42:29,753 --> 00:42:31,825
I don't have it, but my brother does.

640
00:42:32,761 --> 00:42:35,631
- Are you working on anything now?
- Besides the thing with Dick?

641
00:42:35,737 --> 00:42:37,495
Oh, right. Yeah.

642
00:42:37,594 --> 00:42:38,608
How about you?

643
00:42:38,714 --> 00:42:43,449
- I'm working on some abstract...
- No one fills the ice cube trays here.

644
00:42:44,252 --> 00:42:46,391
- Sorry, what were you saying?
- No. It's okay.

645
00:42:46,491 --> 00:42:49,655
- No, what were you saying?
- It really... Nothing.

646
00:42:49,852 --> 00:42:52,187
- Okay.
- I was saying I'm working on some

647
00:42:52,284 --> 00:42:55,067
abstractions in acrylic paint,
but it's not...

648
00:42:55,165 --> 00:42:56,889
I'm not getting paid or anything.

649
00:42:56,989 --> 00:42:59,445
I don't know.
I hate that question, "What do you do?"

650
00:42:59,805 --> 00:43:02,423
- You asked me.
- I know, but...

651
00:43:06,014 --> 00:43:07,738
I think we shouldn't mention the tree.

652
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:09,911
We should let them know there'll be
people and music on Saturday,

653
00:43:10,015 --> 00:43:11,225
and it'll be louder than usual.

654
00:43:11,327 --> 00:43:12,953
Yeah, and they can come over
for a glass of champagne,

655
00:43:13,055 --> 00:43:15,096
but you tell them.
I think they respond to you better.

656
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,956
Well, I am ultimately one of them.

657
00:43:17,055 --> 00:43:18,582
You shouldn't have made me
shave the 'stache.

658
00:43:18,688 --> 00:43:19,637
Yeah, right.

659
00:43:19,744 --> 00:43:23,803
Hey. Ingrid is asking if I was ever gay.
Do you know what that's about?

660
00:43:23,905 --> 00:43:24,832
No.

661
00:43:31,042 --> 00:43:34,686
Hi. I'm Pauline. This is Malcolm.

662
00:43:34,787 --> 00:43:36,248
We met you before.
We're your neighbors.

663
00:43:36,355 --> 00:43:37,849
You gonna cut that tree down?

664
00:43:39,555 --> 00:43:40,984
Well, we grew up with that tree,

665
00:43:41,091 --> 00:43:42,978
and we're getting married
under it on Saturday.

666
00:43:43,076 --> 00:43:47,004
Its roots are growing into our property.
It's rotting. It's killing our plants.

667
00:43:51,076 --> 00:43:53,378
We had the tree doctor out
and he said it was healthy.

668
00:43:56,485 --> 00:43:58,492
- Would it hurt you to say anything?
- What do you want from me?

669
00:43:58,597 --> 00:43:59,742
You're making me do
the whole fucking thing.

670
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:01,918
- You brought up the tree.
- He brought up the tree.

671
00:44:02,022 --> 00:44:05,055
I'm sorry. This was better thought
through back at the house.

672
00:44:05,159 --> 00:44:06,436
We were wondering
if you and your wife,

673
00:44:06,534 --> 00:44:09,665
I'm sorry, I forgot her name,
would like to come over for a glass...

674
00:44:09,767 --> 00:44:12,255
You should ask her.
She makes the plans.

675
00:44:12,359 --> 00:44:13,636
I'm gonna go in now.

676
00:44:17,543 --> 00:44:20,032
I feel like you didn't give me a chance
to say what I wanted to say.

677
00:44:21,416 --> 00:44:23,783
- I want to punch that guy in the nose.
- You've never hit anyone.

678
00:44:23,881 --> 00:44:25,091
- I have too!
- Who?

679
00:44:25,193 --> 00:44:26,719
Lots of people. You don't know them.

680
00:44:26,825 --> 00:44:28,614
They're not around
'cause I punched them.

681
00:44:28,713 --> 00:44:32,510
Don't laugh, Pauline. It's not funny.
L'll punch your sister!

682
00:44:33,609 --> 00:44:34,755
The threat is not out there.

683
00:44:34,859 --> 00:44:37,280
It's in our house.
It's sleeping in my studio.

684
00:44:38,122 --> 00:44:40,227
I mean, I wouldn't actually hit her.

685
00:44:40,331 --> 00:44:43,365
But I feel like doing it.
She's such a fucking idiot.

686
00:44:43,467 --> 00:44:45,060
She's not an idiot.
You might not like her.

687
00:44:45,164 --> 00:44:46,855
She is. She's an idiot! You're an idiot.

688
00:44:46,955 --> 00:44:48,962
- Jesus!
- You're both fucking morons.

689
00:44:49,068 --> 00:44:52,069
I am so fucking... I am trying so hard.

690
00:44:52,172 --> 00:44:53,634
You don't give me any credit!

691
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:55,945
- What is wrong?
- I don't know.

692
00:44:56,493 --> 00:45:00,356
I have the emotional version
of whatever bad feng shui would be.

693
00:45:00,461 --> 00:45:03,145
I don't know. You tell me.
You understand this shit.

694
00:45:03,246 --> 00:45:06,760
- Did you drink your teas?
- Yeah, I drank my fucking teas.

695
00:45:06,862 --> 00:45:08,869
Really, I think when you look back
at this you're going to see

696
00:45:08,975 --> 00:45:12,172
I'm not acting like a crazy person.
That this is the right reaction.

697
00:45:12,271 --> 00:45:14,376
In proportion with what's going on,
this is right.

698
00:45:23,985 --> 00:45:25,327
Let's make love.

699
00:45:34,866 --> 00:45:37,102
- Jim.
- Hey.

700
00:45:37,971 --> 00:45:38,985
How are you?

701
00:45:40,915 --> 00:45:42,738
- Dad!
- Claude!

702
00:45:42,836 --> 00:45:43,763
Hey.

703
00:45:44,884 --> 00:45:45,996
It was a difficult decision,

704
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:48,434
because Claude has so many friends
in school now.

705
00:45:48,756 --> 00:45:51,823
But it's expensive, and Bronx Science
is a great public school.

706
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,061
I didn't get into Stuyvesant.

707
00:45:54,165 --> 00:45:56,718
- He's not a good test taker.
- I went to Stuy.

708
00:45:57,878 --> 00:45:59,787
- Really?
- Really.

709
00:45:59,893 --> 00:46:02,709
I'd rather stay at Packer,
but it's so expensive.

710
00:46:02,805 --> 00:46:05,904
Josh is a great test taker,
but Claude thinks more abstractly.

711
00:46:06,006 --> 00:46:08,560
- He's more creative. Right?
- I guess so.

712
00:46:09,495 --> 00:46:12,594
I saw the one-armed man,
who really has two arms, at the bodega.

713
00:46:13,111 --> 00:46:15,283
Really?
Did you give him confusing change?

714
00:46:15,448 --> 00:46:19,059
I did. I tripped him up with some nickels
and a Canadian quarter.

715
00:46:20,665 --> 00:46:24,146
You know what I tried the other day?
Sitting down to pee.

716
00:46:25,369 --> 00:46:26,547
Have you done this, Jim?

717
00:46:27,833 --> 00:46:28,782
No.

718
00:46:30,682 --> 00:46:31,827
I haven't.

719
00:46:31,961 --> 00:46:33,849
It was a joke, really.
I was gonna call in Pauline

720
00:46:33,946 --> 00:46:35,157
and say, "Guess what I'm doing here?"

721
00:46:35,674 --> 00:46:37,301
Sorry I didn't get to have
that experience.

722
00:46:37,403 --> 00:46:39,029
I was just thinking, you know,

723
00:46:39,131 --> 00:46:41,750
my dad used to say,
"Why stand when you can sit?"

724
00:46:41,851 --> 00:46:43,674
And this is a really good example
of that.

725
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:46,392
I mean, it took me a long time to try,
'cause I was embarrassed.

726
00:46:46,492 --> 00:46:47,703
But you guys do it all the time.

727
00:46:47,804 --> 00:46:50,871
I never sit in a public place.
I always squat and hover.

728
00:46:51,164 --> 00:46:54,264
Anyway, I recommend it.
At least to try it.

729
00:46:54,365 --> 00:46:55,958
Jim, I'm sorry about the room.

730
00:46:56,062 --> 00:46:59,739
It's usually Malcolm's storage room.
So, it's kind of makeshift right now.

731
00:46:59,838 --> 00:47:00,786
It's fine.

732
00:47:02,686 --> 00:47:04,092
Margot, open your gift.

733
00:47:05,374 --> 00:47:08,255
I get self-conscious opening presents
in front of people.

734
00:47:08,735 --> 00:47:12,828
- Anyway, this weekend is about Pauline.
- Pooh, Margot. Go on, open it.

735
00:47:25,569 --> 00:47:26,999
Get on with it. Come on.

736
00:47:34,403 --> 00:47:35,680
Those look warm.

737
00:47:35,779 --> 00:47:38,944
I remember last year in Vermont
you said your feet were freezing.

738
00:47:42,307 --> 00:47:43,551
Thank you.

739
00:47:45,156 --> 00:47:46,432
You're welcome.

740
00:47:49,028 --> 00:47:50,971
I already have slippers.

741
00:47:51,077 --> 00:47:54,143
That's okay. Two sets are fine, right?

742
00:47:55,845 --> 00:47:58,430
It makes me sad to get
a present I already have.

743
00:47:59,333 --> 00:48:03,164
- Why?
- Makes me feel like you don't know me.

744
00:48:07,591 --> 00:48:08,606
What's wrong with your ear?

745
00:48:08,712 --> 00:48:11,679
I asked you not to come
and you did it anyway, so blithely.

746
00:48:11,783 --> 00:48:14,534
We need time alone to sort this out.
You can't just run away.

747
00:48:14,632 --> 00:48:16,542
Okay, we're here.
I'm giving you this time.

748
00:48:16,649 --> 00:48:17,576
Well...

749
00:48:18,601 --> 00:48:20,739
Now you're putting
too much pressure on me.

750
00:48:26,185 --> 00:48:27,647
What is that?

751
00:48:27,754 --> 00:48:30,405
Keep driving. Jim, Jim. No!

752
00:48:30,506 --> 00:48:32,416
- I'm just seeing.
- No.

753
00:48:35,019 --> 00:48:36,327
Stay right there.

754
00:48:40,875 --> 00:48:43,145
Please help me.

755
00:48:43,243 --> 00:48:46,789
- Please. He got hit by a car.
- Jim.

756
00:48:47,724 --> 00:48:48,969
Jim.

757
00:48:49,549 --> 00:48:52,932
- Careful. He might bite you.
- I got him. I got him.

758
00:48:53,198 --> 00:48:54,692
Hurry, he's dying!

759
00:48:55,853 --> 00:48:57,228
He didn't do anything.

760
00:48:57,326 --> 00:49:00,196
Roger's an innocent.
He's an innocent creature.

761
00:49:00,302 --> 00:49:01,546
- Oh, God.
- Margot.

762
00:49:01,646 --> 00:49:03,654
I can't stand her.

763
00:49:11,184 --> 00:49:12,711
You paid, didn't you?

764
00:49:13,071 --> 00:49:15,439
She didn't have her purse with her.
It wasn't so expensive.

765
00:49:17,233 --> 00:49:18,542
Roger's gonna live.

766
00:49:18,672 --> 00:49:22,731
I don't give a fuck about Roger,
and that makes me feel like shit.

767
00:49:24,562 --> 00:49:26,285
You make me feel like shit.

768
00:49:27,890 --> 00:49:29,614
- I wouldn't have stopped.
- Of course you would have.

769
00:49:29,714 --> 00:49:31,405
No, I wouldn't have.

770
00:49:32,307 --> 00:49:35,537
- I hate myself when I'm with you.
- Margot, I'm not...

771
00:49:39,699 --> 00:49:41,455
I can't talk to you
when you're this fucked up.

772
00:49:41,556 --> 00:49:44,459
You're just like Claude in that way.
You make me feel guilty.

773
00:49:45,845 --> 00:49:48,562
Sometimes, I find you so despicable.

774
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:12,727
What's wrong?

775
00:50:15,736 --> 00:50:17,297
I don't know.

776
00:50:19,992 --> 00:50:23,125
Before you gave me your sweater,
I don't think I realized I was cold.

777
00:50:29,499 --> 00:50:31,538
Take me home and go away.

778
00:50:33,563 --> 00:50:37,687
If it were someone else,
I'd understand it. I'd feel sympathy even.

779
00:50:38,204 --> 00:50:42,547
But since it's me,
I just feel bad and horribly critical.

780
00:50:43,196 --> 00:50:44,887
I haven't been able to tell Claude
what's happening,

781
00:50:44,988 --> 00:50:46,931
and I have to. I'm going to.

782
00:50:47,485 --> 00:50:50,420
How can I be all these people?
How can I be married to Jim

783
00:50:50,525 --> 00:50:53,242
and fuck Dick and want them both,
and then neither of them?

784
00:50:53,373 --> 00:50:57,629
I know. We're at that age where
we're becoming invisible to men.

785
00:50:57,790 --> 00:51:00,474
If a guy wants to fuck us,
that's very tempting.

786
00:51:01,374 --> 00:51:02,390
What are you saying?

787
00:51:02,494 --> 00:51:05,495
I'm saying if you get your sense of self
from being fuckable

788
00:51:05,598 --> 00:51:07,803
and that starts to wane, it's very hard.

789
00:51:08,544 --> 00:51:11,708
I almost had an affair, too.
But you don't have to do it.

790
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:16,285
You can, I don't know,
get a manicure or something.

791
00:51:18,561 --> 00:51:21,944
You know, I tell people
you're my closest friend.

792
00:51:22,049 --> 00:51:24,700
- I really miss you.
- Me, too.

793
00:51:24,802 --> 00:51:26,841
But I can't help feeling
that you really came to my wedding

794
00:51:26,946 --> 00:51:29,663
'cause I live a mile away
from the guy you're fucking.

795
00:51:29,762 --> 00:51:32,730
Come on, Pauline,
you make it sound like I'm using you.

796
00:51:32,834 --> 00:51:33,783
Yeah.

797
00:51:35,587 --> 00:51:36,765
You've got a...

798
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:39,773
- Did I get it?
- I think so.

799
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:44,512
Pauline, what are you doing
getting married to this guy?

800
00:51:44,612 --> 00:51:47,001
He's not good enough for you.
He's so coarse.

801
00:51:47,685 --> 00:51:50,141
He's like guys we rejected
when we were 16.

802
00:51:50,949 --> 00:51:52,989
You know,
don't make a mistake like this.

803
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:55,939
I'm sorry. Maybe I have no right to say it.

804
00:51:56,037 --> 00:51:58,526
But you know I'm truthful,
so would you rather I lie?

805
00:52:01,702 --> 00:52:03,164
Who should I be with then?

806
00:52:03,271 --> 00:52:06,140
I don't know.
Someone who's your equal.

807
00:52:07,111 --> 00:52:10,428
You're so smart. You're brilliant.
You're funny.

808
00:52:10,535 --> 00:52:13,569
You're incredibly hilarious.
Paul, you're a great teacher.

809
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:16,934
You're open to things.
You're so beautiful.

810
00:52:17,481 --> 00:52:20,100
Hey! Hey, you! You pick that up.

811
00:52:20,201 --> 00:52:22,241
I will call the police.
This is our property.

812
00:52:22,634 --> 00:52:23,844
Creeps.

813
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:41,187
Wizard!

814
00:52:41,292 --> 00:52:44,075
- What happened to your dad?
- He went to Vermont.

815
00:52:44,173 --> 00:52:45,579
He didn't want to come to the wedding?

816
00:52:45,677 --> 00:52:48,098
I don't think he could. I think he couldn't.

817
00:52:49,581 --> 00:52:52,397
- You want to see me dance?
- Okay.

818
00:53:06,063 --> 00:53:07,012
Wizard.

819
00:53:08,592 --> 00:53:10,000
You're not watching.

820
00:53:17,201 --> 00:53:20,136
- Where you going?
- We have to get home.

821
00:53:23,699 --> 00:53:26,186
- Is that your girlfriend?
- No, she's my cousin.

822
00:53:26,835 --> 00:53:29,552
- You a fruity?
- No.

823
00:53:29,650 --> 00:53:32,106
- You a fruity?
- No.

824
00:53:38,004 --> 00:53:38,930
He's a Vogler.

825
00:53:39,028 --> 00:53:41,842
- Come on. He's just a stupid boy.
- Wait. I have a rock in my shoe.

826
00:53:41,941 --> 00:53:43,370
Come on, Ingrid!

827
00:53:43,732 --> 00:53:44,660
Liar!

828
00:53:46,773 --> 00:53:48,366
Ingrid, get him off me!

829
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:52,339
You're fucking gay. You're fucking gay.

830
00:53:52,566 --> 00:53:53,493
No.

831
00:54:03,927 --> 00:54:05,203
Hangman's ass.

832
00:54:14,873 --> 00:54:17,295
- Don't run so fast.
- He bit me.

833
00:54:17,401 --> 00:54:19,671
- Who bit you?
- A Vogler.

834
00:54:19,770 --> 00:54:21,144
Let me see.

835
00:54:24,410 --> 00:54:26,166
All right. That's it. I'm calling the police.

836
00:54:26,266 --> 00:54:29,266
Don't! Lt'll get worse.
Why did you say anything to them?

837
00:54:29,371 --> 00:54:31,444
What are you talking about?
This isn't my fault.

838
00:54:31,547 --> 00:54:34,515
That boy bit me 'cause you couldn't
keep your fat mouth shut.

839
00:54:34,619 --> 00:54:36,442
Claude, you're being a jerk.

840
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:38,547
You shit in your shoes
and then you fuck 'em!

841
00:54:41,276 --> 00:54:43,480
She wrote a story about Lenny and me.

842
00:54:45,437 --> 00:54:47,128
Yeah. It's in here.

843
00:54:48,253 --> 00:54:50,555
I mean, we were talking
almost every day at this point,

844
00:54:50,653 --> 00:54:52,060
and there was no warning.

845
00:54:52,158 --> 00:54:56,053
I mean, maybe a couple of remarks
that she'd used some things of ours.

846
00:54:56,158 --> 00:54:58,525
And then The New Yorker comes,
we have a subscription,

847
00:54:58,622 --> 00:55:00,084
and there's the story.

848
00:55:00,542 --> 00:55:04,373
And it's things we said and did.
Stuff I told her in confidence.

849
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:06,712
I think it helped end our marriage.

850
00:55:07,295 --> 00:55:10,874
I read it and I thought, "She hates me."

851
00:55:10,975 --> 00:55:12,285
She doesn't hate you.

852
00:55:13,408 --> 00:55:14,586
You think?

853
00:55:16,032 --> 00:55:18,400
Margot tried to murder me
when we were girls.

854
00:55:19,104 --> 00:55:21,439
She put me on a baking sheet,
sprinkled me with paprika,

855
00:55:21,537 --> 00:55:23,261
and put me in the oven.

856
00:55:27,714 --> 00:55:28,860
Jim was here.

857
00:55:30,018 --> 00:55:31,513
Is Jim still writing?

858
00:55:33,155 --> 00:55:35,806
I told him to go to Vermont without me.

859
00:55:36,772 --> 00:55:40,350
I'd like to see him tell a linear story
for a change.

860
00:55:41,316 --> 00:55:43,291
Jim never wanted to make it easy
for the reader, did he?

861
00:55:43,397 --> 00:55:47,259
The nicest man I ever met,
but he can't play the game.

862
00:55:48,357 --> 00:55:51,423
I'm not gonna be joining him.
I'm gonna stay here.

863
00:55:52,709 --> 00:55:53,691
We'll see.

864
00:55:55,527 --> 00:55:56,541
All right?

865
00:55:58,247 --> 00:55:59,424
Okay?

866
00:56:00,998 --> 00:56:02,559
I didn't ask you to do that.

867
00:56:06,663 --> 00:56:08,452
That guy is pointing at us.

868
00:56:09,672 --> 00:56:12,836
I'm very interested in your story
"Middle Children."

869
00:56:13,736 --> 00:56:16,803
The father is a loathsome character,

870
00:56:16,904 --> 00:56:20,287
yet we also feel
a strange sympathy for him.

871
00:56:21,898 --> 00:56:26,022
Well, I was really interested in exploring
a father/daughter relationship.

872
00:56:27,626 --> 00:56:33,540
While he clings to her,
desperately, he suffocates her really.

873
00:56:33,964 --> 00:56:39,714
He also silently resents
the responsibility of parenthood.

874
00:56:41,292 --> 00:56:44,642
There's this sexualized
push-pull with Daphne,

875
00:56:44,748 --> 00:56:48,677
- which I find...
- He craves isolation.

876
00:56:49,773 --> 00:56:51,781
I always saw him as someone who

877
00:56:51,885 --> 00:56:55,530
so over-identifies with
everyone around him

878
00:56:56,654 --> 00:57:00,332
that he begins to lose
all sense of himself.

879
00:57:00,974 --> 00:57:03,113
But you make his only recourse
to abandon his family,

880
00:57:03,215 --> 00:57:06,511
- including his beloved daughter.
- Yes, yes, that's true.

881
00:57:08,496 --> 00:57:12,206
I write historical fiction,
so I don't have to answer to this,

882
00:57:12,304 --> 00:57:15,982
but I wonder, for someone
who writes so nakedly about family,

883
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:19,342
how autobiographical is this portrait?

884
00:57:21,233 --> 00:57:23,274
My father was a loving person.

885
00:57:23,378 --> 00:57:26,313
He had his days, of course,
but he was devoted to us as children.

886
00:57:26,418 --> 00:57:29,036
I would never have written this portrait,
were it true.

887
00:57:31,411 --> 00:57:35,470
But I'm interested in how the father
could be, in fact, a portrait of you.

888
00:57:41,172 --> 00:57:42,317
I don't...

889
00:57:44,213 --> 00:57:46,318
Why do you assume that it's...

890
00:57:47,477 --> 00:57:50,030
That, I mean, we all take from life.

891
00:57:54,294 --> 00:57:56,913
I had to have our refrigerator repaired
the other day

892
00:57:57,014 --> 00:57:59,470
at our apartment in Manhattan,

893
00:57:59,575 --> 00:58:03,798
and I was alone with this guy.

894
00:58:03,895 --> 00:58:05,521
I think he was Puerto Rican.

895
00:58:05,624 --> 00:58:08,973
He was sent over by Whirlpool,

896
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:12,791
who I think it is, makes our fridge.

897
00:58:15,801 --> 00:58:18,584
Although he did say that he worked for
an independent organization,

898
00:58:18,681 --> 00:58:20,144
that Whirlpool subcontracts.

899
00:58:21,657 --> 00:58:23,152
I think he was retarded.

900
00:58:26,522 --> 00:58:27,798
There was...

901
00:58:29,019 --> 00:58:33,623
There was an anger in him,
and suddenly,

902
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:37,365
suddenly I became afraid for my life.

903
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:44,884
I called Jim at NYU, and I...

904
00:58:45,053 --> 00:58:47,028
I asked him to come home.

905
00:58:52,254 --> 00:58:54,709
I think it was Frigidaire
who made our fridge.

906
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:02,363
I'm gonna need...
I'm gonna need to take a moment here.

907
00:59:13,185 --> 00:59:14,527
You're an asshole.

908
00:59:29,539 --> 00:59:32,768
- I need to be alone right now, okay?
- What's wrong?

909
00:59:32,868 --> 00:59:36,927
I don't know.
L'll tell you sometime. Go on.

910
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:38,590
Are you sure?

911
00:59:38,692 --> 00:59:41,474
Yeah. Go with Mom. L'll see you later.

912
00:59:41,572 --> 00:59:43,744
- You said Mom.
- You know what I mean.

913
00:59:43,845 --> 00:59:44,989
Go with Pauline.

914
00:59:45,861 --> 00:59:49,855
Jesus, do I need to spell it out for you?

915
00:59:52,390 --> 00:59:53,666
Go with her.

916
00:59:56,103 --> 00:59:58,405
There was blood on the floor,

917
00:59:58,502 --> 01:00:01,732
and it was cold,
and it was snowing inside the hallway.

918
01:00:02,567 --> 01:00:06,245
There was all these like
weird like torture devices,

919
01:00:06,344 --> 01:00:10,403
and to get out of them,
you had to like torture yourself.

920
01:00:10,504 --> 01:00:12,195
I wasn't so scared
while it was happening.

921
01:00:12,297 --> 01:00:14,565
I was more scared afterwards.
It was like

922
01:00:15,113 --> 01:00:17,186
I was in it and I was just spectating.

923
01:00:18,186 --> 01:00:20,324
I didn't have to do any of the stuff.

924
01:00:21,579 --> 01:00:25,157
I could teach you to swim if you like.
We wouldn't have to tell your mom.

925
01:00:26,283 --> 01:00:28,804
I don't really want to.

926
01:00:29,963 --> 01:00:33,259
- I like Malcolm.
- You do? Good.

927
01:00:35,404 --> 01:00:37,259
I do, too. I don't know.

928
01:00:38,924 --> 01:00:40,866
It's hard, I think,
to find people in the world

929
01:00:40,973 --> 01:00:42,729
you love more than your family.

930
01:00:44,077 --> 01:00:47,372
You're your mom's favorite.
Do you know that?

931
01:00:47,470 --> 01:00:50,284
She's always liked you best,
more than Jim even.

932
01:00:51,853 --> 01:00:53,283
Has she talked to you yet?

933
01:00:53,390 --> 01:00:56,686
I don't think so. About what?

934
01:00:56,783 --> 01:00:58,190
You okay?

935
01:00:58,703 --> 01:01:01,224
It's hard to see your mom
like that, right?

936
01:01:01,327 --> 01:01:02,276
Get attacked like that?

937
01:01:02,671 --> 01:01:06,119
It was mean what he did.
I think it was really shitty.

938
01:01:06,352 --> 01:01:08,589
- I think Dick's an asshole.
- Yeah.

939
01:01:11,792 --> 01:01:13,997
You know,

940
01:01:14,096 --> 01:01:16,366
your mom's going through
a rough time right now.

941
01:01:17,522 --> 01:01:19,856
And she can be scary when she's angry.

942
01:01:21,299 --> 01:01:25,227
Whatever she says, like if she tells you
she's leaving your father, just know,

943
01:01:25,330 --> 01:01:27,982
well, she often changes her mind.

944
01:01:28,084 --> 01:01:30,669
And I don't want you to worry
about anything right now.

945
01:01:34,132 --> 01:01:36,620
- He's cutting it down.
- Good.

946
01:01:36,724 --> 01:01:39,311
My dad's late to pick me up.
I hope I'm not a pain.

947
01:01:39,412 --> 01:01:41,354
You're not a pain, Maisy.

948
01:01:50,550 --> 01:01:53,453
I told Paul
I didn't want you guys to come.

949
01:01:53,558 --> 01:01:55,020
I thought it was interesting.

950
01:01:56,438 --> 01:01:59,603
- What did Paul say?
- I think she liked it.

951
01:01:59,703 --> 01:02:01,330
Yeah, right.

952
01:02:03,096 --> 01:02:06,392
- Did you talk about me afterwards?
- No.

953
01:02:07,448 --> 01:02:10,318
- I can tell you're lying.
- We didn't, Mom.

954
01:02:10,425 --> 01:02:12,018
I don't trust her.

955
01:02:14,681 --> 01:02:17,550
Pauline told me
she's very disappointed in you.

956
01:02:18,106 --> 01:02:21,489
- Why?
- She thinks you laze about the house.

957
01:02:21,594 --> 01:02:24,562
Ingrid's always offering to help
clean and cook.

958
01:02:26,139 --> 01:02:30,267
She made bracelets for all the guests.
Even Malcolm puts up the tent.

959
01:02:30,524 --> 01:02:33,077
You wait until everyone else
does it for you.

960
01:02:33,179 --> 01:02:35,220
- That's not true.
- It is true.

961
01:02:37,116 --> 01:02:39,483
I wish I'd taught you better manners.

962
01:02:40,093 --> 01:02:42,963
I can try to make popovers,
if I can remember how.

963
01:02:43,069 --> 01:02:44,444
Don't bother.

964
01:02:50,110 --> 01:02:52,052
Why are you looking at me like that?

965
01:02:53,118 --> 01:02:55,453
I just see how much you've changed.

966
01:02:56,511 --> 01:03:00,767
Your body language.
You used to be rounder, more graceful.

967
01:03:00,991 --> 01:03:03,839
You're so stiff now, so blas¨¦.

968
01:03:06,913 --> 01:03:08,887
I can't explain it.

969
01:03:13,057 --> 01:03:14,202
It's okay though.

970
01:03:25,475 --> 01:03:27,231
You're still handsome.

971
01:03:29,571 --> 01:03:31,295
Are you able to do this yourself?

972
01:03:32,036 --> 01:03:34,044
Pauline, do you want me
to cut it down or not?

973
01:03:35,748 --> 01:03:37,209
Watch the tent.

974
01:03:52,230 --> 01:03:53,889
I liked how it looked on Vogler.

975
01:03:53,990 --> 01:03:57,885
I think it's over between Margot
and Dick. He was so cruel to her today.

976
01:03:57,991 --> 01:04:00,577
And poor Claude had to watch it all.

977
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:01,825
She should just get out of the marriage,

978
01:04:01,927 --> 01:04:04,033
and then she can fuck
whoever she wants, you know.

979
01:04:04,136 --> 01:04:05,925
And Dick Koosman...

980
01:04:06,024 --> 01:04:09,123
I agree.
I hate the idea of Dick fucking Margot.

981
01:04:09,225 --> 01:04:10,916
What does that mean?
You want to fuck Margot?

982
01:04:11,016 --> 01:04:12,773
Pauline, that's not what I said.

983
01:04:12,874 --> 01:04:14,881
I know you have a crush on her.
You already told me that.

984
01:04:16,169 --> 01:04:17,795
I didn't say that!

985
01:04:17,898 --> 01:04:20,932
I said I thought she was attractive
after you grilled me.

986
01:04:21,482 --> 01:04:24,963
She has no interest in me anyway,
not that it would matter if she did.

987
01:04:25,067 --> 01:04:26,855
Have you ever done anything like that?

988
01:04:27,819 --> 01:04:31,649
- What do you mean?
- Have you ever cheated on me?

989
01:04:31,756 --> 01:04:34,920
No! Can I do this?

990
01:04:35,564 --> 01:04:38,564
Those e-mails that you have
with that student of mine?

991
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:40,676
Did that...

992
01:04:40,781 --> 01:04:42,789
- I know you said it was nothing.
- It was.

993
01:04:42,893 --> 01:04:45,642
I just... Can you say it again?

994
01:04:45,742 --> 01:04:48,590
I just did. Now can I cut down the tree?

995
01:04:48,686 --> 01:04:50,988
- You never did anything with her?
- No.

996
01:04:51,087 --> 01:04:55,211
She e-mailed me
after that reading at the college,

997
01:04:55,503 --> 01:04:57,608
- and, you know, we were friends.
- Right.

998
01:04:57,711 --> 01:05:00,200
Just a regular friendship
between you and a 20-year-old girl.

999
01:05:00,304 --> 01:05:02,409
Pauline,
how many times do I have to say it?

1000
01:05:02,512 --> 01:05:03,756
But why don't I believe it?

1001
01:05:03,857 --> 01:05:05,799
Because Margot can't understand
why you're with me,

1002
01:05:05,904 --> 01:05:08,239
and now when she's around,
you look for things.

1003
01:05:09,168 --> 01:05:11,176
- You promise?
- I promise.

1004
01:05:12,625 --> 01:05:14,992
Okay. I'm sorry.

1005
01:05:16,914 --> 01:05:17,994
It's okay.

1006
01:05:30,132 --> 01:05:33,482
- I'm gonna tell you something.
- What?

1007
01:05:33,588 --> 01:05:36,687
- I don't want to lose you though, okay?
- What?

1008
01:05:38,836 --> 01:05:40,593
I'm gonna tell you, just let me...

1009
01:05:43,477 --> 01:05:44,623
Maisy.

1010
01:05:45,013 --> 01:05:47,119
- I don't wanna know.
- We didn't really do anything.

1011
01:05:47,222 --> 01:05:48,367
We were goofing around.

1012
01:05:48,470 --> 01:05:50,893
I was making fun of her
'cause she dates a jock.

1013
01:05:51,639 --> 01:05:54,541
I shouldn't have put myself
in that position, I know that.

1014
01:05:55,288 --> 01:05:58,637
We brushed lips.
Really, it was hardly a kiss.

1015
01:05:58,743 --> 01:06:01,045
And then we stopped. That was it.

1016
01:06:02,776 --> 01:06:04,500
Our tongues touched.

1017
01:06:04,601 --> 01:06:07,416
I don't wanna undersell it either.
I mean, we made out.

1018
01:06:07,513 --> 01:06:09,782
I made out with her.

1019
01:06:09,881 --> 01:06:12,816
I don't know why. I don't even like her.

1020
01:06:13,658 --> 01:06:15,545
It's been a heady time.

1021
01:06:17,274 --> 01:06:21,333
What are you thinking?
Please tell me what you're thinking.

1022
01:06:27,644 --> 01:06:29,018
Has anyone seen Wizard?

1023
01:06:29,115 --> 01:06:31,220
No. Where's Maisy?

1024
01:06:37,917 --> 01:06:42,041
Hi. Sorry, I had to go.
I hope that's okay. I used yours.

1025
01:06:46,206 --> 01:06:51,324
I love your wedding dress.
It's so unconventional and great.

1026
01:07:07,297 --> 01:07:09,818
- Is everything okay?
- Nothing.

1027
01:07:11,265 --> 01:07:13,174
Hey, Claude,
do you want to play croquet?

1028
01:07:13,281 --> 01:07:14,328
Okay.

1029
01:07:24,387 --> 01:07:25,849
There's Dick!

1030
01:07:29,093 --> 01:07:30,172
Dad!

1031
01:07:30,756 --> 01:07:31,684
Malcolm...

1032
01:07:32,965 --> 01:07:35,453
- Is it almost ready?
- Almost.

1033
01:08:05,609 --> 01:08:10,181
I didn't do anything!
I didn't do anything! No!

1034
01:08:15,723 --> 01:08:18,593
You fucking sleazebag!

1035
01:08:24,651 --> 01:08:28,875
Fuck off, dickhead! No! No!

1036
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:35,370
- I don't ever want to see you again.
- You fucking dickbag! She's lying!

1037
01:08:40,205 --> 01:08:41,449
Oh, man!

1038
01:08:56,528 --> 01:09:00,652
He looked everywhere
and tried to find her

1039
01:09:00,753 --> 01:09:02,989
- Come with me to New York.
- I can't talk about it.

1040
01:09:03,088 --> 01:09:05,739
Okay. But you can't marry him.
I mean, you have to leave.

1041
01:09:05,841 --> 01:09:07,751
We can think about what to do
with the baby when we get to...

1042
01:09:07,857 --> 01:09:09,962
- Margot, I can't.
- Don't turn vague. Listen to me.

1043
01:09:10,065 --> 01:09:11,789
I want you to pack all your things
and get out of here.

1044
01:09:11,889 --> 01:09:13,995
You can take our car
and leave it at the ferry.

1045
01:09:14,099 --> 01:09:15,692
I can make popovers.

1046
01:09:17,298 --> 01:09:19,568
Do you love me? Good.

1047
01:09:19,826 --> 01:09:21,899
Don't you take this out on me.
I'm on your side.

1048
01:09:22,003 --> 01:09:22,930
No, you're not.

1049
01:09:23,027 --> 01:09:24,620
I kept my mouth shut
because I wanted to...

1050
01:09:24,724 --> 01:09:28,204
No, you haven't kept your mouth shut.
No, you haven't kept your mouth shut!

1051
01:09:28,307 --> 01:09:32,399
Okay, I told you. And I was right.
I mean, he's done an insane thing.

1052
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:35,468
You don't know this man.
What he did is criminal.

1053
01:09:35,574 --> 01:09:38,062
- Margot, I can't.
- It's pedophilia.

1054
01:09:39,893 --> 01:09:40,875
Get out.

1055
01:09:42,518 --> 01:09:46,642
Becky and I talk about you,
about what a monster you are.

1056
01:09:46,743 --> 01:09:49,078
Is it 'cause Mom gave me the house?

1057
01:09:49,174 --> 01:09:52,590
We've been talking about you.
Becky can't stand you.

1058
01:09:52,695 --> 01:09:55,478
Becky says you have
borderline personality disorder.

1059
01:09:55,576 --> 01:09:58,544
- What are you saying?
- Can't I have anything?

1060
01:09:58,648 --> 01:10:01,398
What was I thinking?
I can't have anything.

1061
01:10:01,497 --> 01:10:05,872
I let you in. God damn, dude!
You're such an asshole!

1062
01:10:07,258 --> 01:10:11,087
You hate me.
You're such a fucking asshole!

1063
01:10:11,194 --> 01:10:14,391
Get out of my fucking house! Get out!

1064
01:10:14,490 --> 01:10:17,109
I don't recognize you.
It's like you're channeling someone.

1065
01:10:17,531 --> 01:10:18,479
Ingrid!

1066
01:10:20,027 --> 01:10:20,604
Ingrid!

1067
01:10:20,604 --> 01:10:21,105
Ingrid!

1068
01:10:22,459 --> 01:10:23,441
Ingrid!

1069
01:10:30,588 --> 01:10:31,516
Come on.

1070
01:10:34,876 --> 01:10:35,825
Okay.

1071
01:10:35,933 --> 01:10:39,250
- It wasn't gonna fall.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1072
01:10:41,373 --> 01:10:42,650
Wizard!

1073
01:11:05,505 --> 01:11:06,880
I thought you couldn't drive.

1074
01:11:06,977 --> 01:11:09,760
Of course I can drive.
Why does everyone say that?

1075
01:11:09,858 --> 01:11:11,287
I used to drive.

1076
01:11:11,393 --> 01:11:13,630
We have to call people and cancel.

1077
01:11:13,730 --> 01:11:15,192
Can I still sing?

1078
01:11:18,722 --> 01:11:21,854
- You do smell.
- Well, I'm not wearing any deodorant.

1079
01:11:21,955 --> 01:11:23,843
- Shit.
- What?

1080
01:11:23,939 --> 01:11:28,380
I don't think... No.
We don't have any brakes.

1081
01:11:29,348 --> 01:11:31,519
- The brakes are bad. That's right.
- What does that mean?

1082
01:11:31,621 --> 01:11:34,655
- What do you think it means?
- I mean, what can we do?

1083
01:11:35,430 --> 01:11:36,379
Mom!

1084
01:11:37,285 --> 01:11:39,074
- Don't!
- Shit!

1085
01:11:43,815 --> 01:11:45,309
I've ruined these shoes.

1086
01:11:50,759 --> 01:11:52,483
Mom, are you okay?

1087
01:11:52,583 --> 01:11:54,143
Don't look. Shit!

1088
01:11:55,944 --> 01:11:58,465
- Mom, what happened?
- Nothing.

1089
01:11:59,593 --> 01:12:01,317
Did she poop in her pants?

1090
01:12:02,089 --> 01:12:04,675
It happens to everyone, not just babies.

1091
01:12:04,905 --> 01:12:06,530
It'll happen to you too, someday.

1092
01:12:10,698 --> 01:12:12,804
I left Mom and Becky a message.

1093
01:12:13,450 --> 01:12:15,589
I don't think Mom knows
how to work the machine.

1094
01:12:18,475 --> 01:12:19,849
I can hear it flapping.

1095
01:12:19,948 --> 01:12:22,086
You should take care of that.
It can hatch eggs.

1096
01:12:46,384 --> 01:12:48,488
Okay, I'm gonna tell him.

1097
01:12:48,783 --> 01:12:51,369
No. I don't want him to...

1098
01:12:52,208 --> 01:12:54,826
And l'll put him on the bus. Bye.

1099
01:13:02,673 --> 01:13:06,383
Sweetie, there's a bus that leaves to
Vermont from town tomorrow morning.

1100
01:13:06,482 --> 01:13:09,515
I just talked to your dad,
and he'll be there to pick you up.

1101
01:13:09,618 --> 01:13:12,336
- Aren't you coming?
- No.

1102
01:13:13,523 --> 01:13:14,800
Why not?

1103
01:13:14,898 --> 01:13:17,714
Because I have to help out
Paul and Ingrid.

1104
01:13:17,811 --> 01:13:19,634
Then I don't want to leave tomorrow.

1105
01:13:29,909 --> 01:13:31,152
There's Malcolm!

1106
01:13:32,565 --> 01:13:34,159
No, honey.

1107
01:13:35,413 --> 01:13:37,486
I can't live in that house alone.

1108
01:13:38,518 --> 01:13:39,598
You're gonna be fine.

1109
01:13:39,702 --> 01:13:43,413
Maybe I could get a place in Brooklyn,
Williamsburg or something.

1110
01:13:43,510 --> 01:13:44,973
People are living there, right?

1111
01:13:45,079 --> 01:13:48,046
No, you don't want to live there.
It's only young people.

1112
01:13:48,151 --> 01:13:50,191
But what do you think of that idea?

1113
01:13:51,127 --> 01:13:53,266
Maybe. Maybe. Let's see.

1114
01:13:53,784 --> 01:13:55,344
Listen, if you don't want
to come with me,

1115
01:13:55,448 --> 01:13:57,783
I'm sure Mom will let you stay with her.

1116
01:13:57,880 --> 01:13:59,986
You're already trying to pass me off
on to Mom.

1117
01:14:00,089 --> 01:14:03,122
Don't say that. You're coming with me.

1118
01:14:03,225 --> 01:14:04,469
You don't even know
where you're gonna live.

1119
01:14:04,569 --> 01:14:06,990
You might have to move in
with Mom, too.

1120
01:14:07,322 --> 01:14:08,270
What?

1121
01:14:09,881 --> 01:14:13,232
You said you were going to tell him.
I'm sorry.

1122
01:14:15,899 --> 01:14:17,721
What have I done?

1123
01:14:19,707 --> 01:14:21,017
What have I done?

1124
01:14:34,749 --> 01:14:37,138
- What?
- Nothing.

1125
01:14:38,782 --> 01:14:41,051
Just then I felt so much love for you.

1126
01:14:43,519 --> 01:14:44,501
Good night, Mommy.

1127
01:14:53,856 --> 01:14:54,903
Hey!

1128
01:14:55,008 --> 01:14:56,918
You cannot write about this.
You can't have it.

1129
01:14:57,024 --> 01:14:58,454
That wasn't about you.

1130
01:14:58,561 --> 01:14:59,575
You already took a part of my life,

1131
01:14:59,681 --> 01:15:01,088
that story you wrote
about Lenny and me.

1132
01:15:01,185 --> 01:15:02,527
- It wasn't about you.
- It ruined our marriage.

1133
01:15:02,626 --> 01:15:03,553
Oh, God.

1134
01:15:03,649 --> 01:15:05,307
You can't have any more.

1135
01:15:05,698 --> 01:15:07,608
And that goes for Ingrid
and Malcolm and Wizard.

1136
01:15:07,715 --> 01:15:09,241
We all own our own rights.
They're not for sale.

1137
01:15:09,378 --> 01:15:11,385
Give it back. Give it.

1138
01:15:12,290 --> 01:15:14,461
If I could read your handwriting,
I'm sure I'd be furious.

1139
01:15:15,844 --> 01:15:19,324
But if I ever see a story that involves
a hotel room or any of this shit,

1140
01:15:20,932 --> 01:15:22,720
I will fucking take your bowels out.

1141
01:15:32,518 --> 01:15:35,649
You've now successfully ruined
two of my marriages.

1142
01:15:36,678 --> 01:15:38,620
You're not wearing any underwear.

1143
01:15:38,726 --> 01:15:42,239
It's hot. I'm pregnant. Move over. Jesus.

1144
01:15:43,047 --> 01:15:46,277
You're not hot. Your feet are cold.

1145
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:49,889
Stop touching me. I am so hot.
Feel my head.

1146
01:15:53,864 --> 01:15:55,327
You got a fever.

1147
01:15:55,848 --> 01:15:58,467
I don't have a fever. I'm pregnant.

1148
01:15:58,570 --> 01:16:01,287
- Are you always like this?
- Get used to it.

1149
01:16:03,114 --> 01:16:06,344
Mom and Becky share a bed.
You and I will probably get the other.

1150
01:16:07,563 --> 01:16:09,668
You should just go to Vermont.

1151
01:16:10,922 --> 01:16:13,028
You know, I was thinking,

1152
01:16:13,834 --> 01:16:16,835
if you want,
you and Ingrid could go to Vermont.

1153
01:16:18,283 --> 01:16:19,810
Keep Claude company.

1154
01:16:20,684 --> 01:16:22,245
Jim adores you.

1155
01:16:24,493 --> 01:16:26,665
You don't like Malcolm
because you're not attracted to him.

1156
01:16:26,924 --> 01:16:28,812
- Will you do it?
- No.

1157
01:16:30,317 --> 01:16:31,626
I won't do that for you.

1158
01:16:37,774 --> 01:16:39,684
Did you two talk about me today?

1159
01:16:42,415 --> 01:16:43,397
What did you say?

1160
01:16:48,047 --> 01:16:50,219
I told him you often change your mind.

1161
01:17:10,386 --> 01:17:12,624
I'm sorry, sweetie.
There's something wrong with me.

1162
01:17:12,723 --> 01:17:15,953
- I'm gonna call him.
- Don't do that, I'm telling you...

1163
01:17:16,051 --> 01:17:18,026
I need some clothes and things.

1164
01:17:18,484 --> 01:17:20,873
He should get the hell out of our house.

1165
01:17:21,364 --> 01:17:23,699
Okay, l'll tell him to get the hell out
of our house.

1166
01:17:33,366 --> 01:17:35,438
You left it in my room.

1167
01:17:45,975 --> 01:17:48,245
The tent looks so Ionely.

1168
01:17:48,343 --> 01:17:49,936
There's no one to get married in it.

1169
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:52,692
I know, and it's totally smashed.

1170
01:17:52,792 --> 01:17:56,687
I'm such a fucking idiot.
Please don't take me seriously.

1171
01:17:57,080 --> 01:18:00,758
I mean, take me seriously,
but not the fucked-up parts, you know.

1172
01:18:01,658 --> 01:18:04,342
I love you so much. Please marry me.

1173
01:18:06,490 --> 01:18:08,694
You can't do what you did again.
Do you understand?

1174
01:18:08,794 --> 01:18:10,038
I promise.

1175
01:18:10,651 --> 01:18:12,244
No matter how tempting.

1176
01:18:26,141 --> 01:18:28,530
I don't know. I don't know.

1177
01:18:29,502 --> 01:18:33,593
I ate some of the cake.
I don't know why, but I did it.

1178
01:18:33,694 --> 01:18:35,669
Well, how was it?

1179
01:18:36,383 --> 01:18:37,659
Good.

1180
01:18:37,758 --> 01:18:41,337
Not too sweet? They sometimes make
their stuff too sweet.

1181
01:18:41,439 --> 01:18:42,748
Maybe.

1182
01:18:42,847 --> 01:18:45,848
Maybe it was. I didn't even notice.

1183
01:18:45,951 --> 01:18:49,300
They fucked up the cake. How sad.

1184
01:18:50,304 --> 01:18:53,600
I miss you. I love our little baby.

1185
01:18:54,369 --> 01:18:55,711
I miss you.

1186
01:18:58,689 --> 01:19:02,748
I miss you, too.
Maybe we should do another seminar.

1187
01:19:08,355 --> 01:19:10,395
I can't understand you, honey.

1188
01:19:18,756 --> 01:19:20,382
Honey, I can't understand you.

1189
01:19:23,332 --> 01:19:25,788
There's Nana and Aunt Becky,
and they have ice cream.

1190
01:19:25,925 --> 01:19:27,550
They didn't get my message.

1191
01:19:27,653 --> 01:19:29,563
I told you, she doesn't know
how to work the machine.

1192
01:19:29,669 --> 01:19:31,196
What, you're not coming?

1193
01:19:31,718 --> 01:19:33,245
I'm coming. I'm coming.
What did he say?

1194
01:19:33,606 --> 01:19:35,167
- Mom!
- Nana!

1195
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:37,093
- What did he say?
- Nana!

1196
01:19:37,190 --> 01:19:39,646
- Mom, hey.
- Hey, was that Margot I saw?

1197
01:19:39,751 --> 01:19:42,272
- Don't look, keep walking.
- Why are we going this way?

1198
01:19:42,376 --> 01:19:44,164
We have to get you to your bus.

1199
01:19:46,504 --> 01:19:47,911
Did you do something?

1200
01:19:48,616 --> 01:19:50,176
What do you mean, do something?

1201
01:19:51,465 --> 01:19:53,221
I mean,
why is the wedding not happening?

1202
01:19:53,321 --> 01:19:54,882
Is it something that you did?

1203
01:19:54,985 --> 01:19:57,505
Pauline has transferred
all of her stuff onto me.

1204
01:19:58,442 --> 01:20:00,547
I don't understand her anymore.

1205
01:20:02,314 --> 01:20:04,965
Why did she pick that guy?
It's really berserk.

1206
01:20:05,482 --> 01:20:07,937
You know, she referred to me
as her closest friend.

1207
01:20:10,411 --> 01:20:13,989
We never see one another.
I mean, we're not close,

1208
01:20:14,123 --> 01:20:16,065
even if we wanted to be.

1209
01:20:23,181 --> 01:20:24,458
But was there anything real?

1210
01:20:24,557 --> 01:20:27,045
No. How many times do I have to say it?

1211
01:20:27,342 --> 01:20:29,284
Jesus, do you think that little of me?

1212
01:20:34,285 --> 01:20:36,806
It's good you're going.
I wouldn't want to be around me, either.

1213
01:20:37,647 --> 01:20:40,014
Are you gonna find
Pauline and Nana after I leave?

1214
01:20:40,111 --> 01:20:43,177
I don't know. Maybe l'll go to church.

1215
01:20:44,143 --> 01:20:47,340
- Are you angry at me?
- No, honey, I'm not mad at you.

1216
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:50,444
Everything's fine.
I'm not mad at anyone.

1217
01:20:50,545 --> 01:20:53,480
- Can you come with me?
- No. You know that.

1218
01:20:53,584 --> 01:20:55,690
Now we should talk about
the next few months a little bit,

1219
01:20:55,794 --> 01:20:57,998
- and what's gonna happen.
- I don't like Vermont.

1220
01:20:58,354 --> 01:21:00,011
Your dad is gonna be very happy
to see you,

1221
01:21:00,114 --> 01:21:02,962
and I'm sure Josh is just
dying to hang out.

1222
01:21:03,410 --> 01:21:04,817
Please come, Mom.

1223
01:21:05,170 --> 01:21:07,341
Stop it, okay? Stop it.

1224
01:21:10,931 --> 01:21:13,233
You used to need me
to watch you when you played.

1225
01:21:13,940 --> 01:21:14,888
What do you mean?

1226
01:21:14,996 --> 01:21:17,233
When you first started playing
with friends, you wouldn't do it,

1227
01:21:17,332 --> 01:21:19,188
unless I was watching.

1228
01:21:19,284 --> 01:21:21,773
You were always afraid
I was gonna go out the back door.

1229
01:21:21,878 --> 01:21:23,600
I don't know
where you thought I would go.

1230
01:21:23,700 --> 01:21:25,610
Our backyard didn't lead anywhere.

1231
01:21:30,262 --> 01:21:32,018
I masturbated last night.

1232
01:21:32,566 --> 01:21:35,381
While everyone was asleep,
I went into the bathroom and did it.

1233
01:21:35,766 --> 01:21:37,807
You don't need to tell me that, sweetie.

1234
01:21:41,272 --> 01:21:44,142
- You've got to go.
- How will you get home?

1235
01:21:44,856 --> 01:21:46,198
I don't know.

1236
01:21:46,296 --> 01:21:50,574
Maybe l'll get Dick to drive me to the...

1237
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:55,062
I lost the word for a second, the train.

1238
01:21:56,409 --> 01:21:58,831
Come on.
You always don't want to leave me,

1239
01:21:58,937 --> 01:22:01,426
and you always have a good time
once you do.

1240
01:22:01,626 --> 01:22:05,402
- I think you like getting away from me.
- I don't. I like hanging out with you.

1241
01:22:23,966 --> 01:22:25,852
They make your face look too wide.

1242
01:22:29,598 --> 01:22:31,671
- See you soon.
- Bye, sweetie.

1243
01:22:32,478 --> 01:22:33,754
Say you'll see me soon.

1244
01:22:33,854 --> 01:22:37,084
Hey, you're acting like a baby. Go on.

1245
01:23:12,164 --> 01:23:13,146
Wait!

1246
01:23:15,621 --> 01:23:16,603
Wait!

1247
01:23:18,180 --> 01:23:19,108
Wait!

1248
01:23:22,821 --> 01:23:23,901
Wait!

1249
01:23:35,175 --> 01:23:37,957
- Did you see me running out there?
- Yeah.

1250
01:23:43,912 --> 01:23:45,668
That was a lot of running.

1251
01:23:47,368 --> 01:23:49,375
I'm out of breath.

1252
01:23:57,108 --> 01:24:09,108
THE END
