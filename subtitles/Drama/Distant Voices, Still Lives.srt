(Descending footsteps)

Have a cuppa and a ciggie

00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:46,878
WOMAN: I get the blues when it's raining

28
00:01:47,601 --> 00:01:53,595
The blues I can't lose when it rains

29
00:01:54,442 --> 00:01:57,750
Now each little raindrop

30
00:01:57,801 --> 00:02:01,193
Falls on my window pane

31
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:05,717
Reminds me of the tears I shed

32
00:02:06,243 --> 00:02:09,551
The tears were all in vain

33
00:02:10,082 --> 00:02:16,841
So I sit and wait for the sun to shine

34
00:02:17,363 --> 00:02:22,835
To shine all my blues away

35
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:27,200
It rained when I met you

36
00:02:27,244 --> 00:02:30,918
And it rained when I lost you

37
00:02:31,445 --> 00:02:38,920
So I get the blues when it rains

38
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:47,400
JESSYE NORMAN: There's a man

39
00:02:47,446 --> 00:02:50,643
Going round

40
00:02:50,686 --> 00:02:55,680
Taking names

41
00:02:56,766 --> 00:02:59,155
There's a man

42
00:02:59,206 --> 00:03:01,924
Going round

43
00:03:01,966 --> 00:03:06,960
Taking names

44
00:03:07,366 --> 00:03:13,602
He has taken my father's name

45
00:03:14,207 --> 00:03:20,841
And he's left my heart in pain

46
00:03:21,847 --> 00:03:24,316
There's a man

47
00:03:24,367 --> 00:03:26,962
Going round

48
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:32,206
Taking names

49
00:03:33,728 --> 00:03:35,320
Oh-oh

50
00:03:35,368 --> 00:03:44,004
Death is that man taking names

51
00:03:45,409 --> 00:03:46,888
Oh-oh

52
00:03:46,929 --> 00:03:55,565
Death is that man taking names

53
00:03:55,609 --> 00:04:01,923
He has taken my brother's name

54
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:10,323
And he's left my heart in pain

55
00:04:11,331 --> 00:04:16,449
There's a man going round

56
00:04:16,488 --> 00:04:24,569
Taking names

57
00:04:25,411 --> 00:04:28,529
There's a man

58
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:36,363
Going round

59
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:46,249
Taking names

60
00:04:49,452 --> 00:04:51,442
I wish me dad was here.

61
00:04:53,932 --> 00:04:55,526
(Thinks) I don't

62
00:04:55,572 --> 00:04:58,564
He was a bastard and I bleedin' hated llm

63
00:05:00,853 --> 00:05:04,846
- Can I have the money to go to the dance?
DAD: Get that cellar done. Never mind dances.

64
00:05:04,894 --> 00:05:07,692
But Dad there's rats down there.
I'm terrified of rats.

65
00:05:07,733 --> 00:05:09,644
DAD: No cellar, no dance.

66
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:22,844
Can I go to the dance, Dad?

67
00:05:34,613 --> 00:05:35,605
Thanks.

68
00:05:35,654 --> 00:05:37,646
You're just like your Auntie May!

69
00:05:37,694 --> 00:05:40,291
- Aaah!
- And she was no bleedin' good!

70
00:05:41,295 --> 00:05:43,286
(Screams)

71
00:05:51,735 --> 00:05:53,726
I don't half wish me dad was here.

72
00:05:55,857 --> 00:05:57,846
(Rumble of thunder)

73
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:05,088
Come out and fight me, you bastard!

74
00:06:05,136 --> 00:06:06,887
Come out and fight!

75
00:06:06,935 --> 00:06:08,928
Come out and fight me, you bastard!

76
00:06:08,976 --> 00:06:10,252
You bastard!

77
00:06:10,298 --> 00:06:11,889
Come out and fight!

78
00:06:18,658 --> 00:06:20,649
Will you have a drink with me, Dad?

79
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:23,286
No.

80
00:06:29,377 --> 00:06:31,370
Have a drink with him, Tommy.

81
00:06:31,418 --> 00:06:32,896
Please

82
00:06:32,937 --> 00:06:34,336
I said...

83
00:06:34,377 --> 00:06:35,858
no.

84
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,134
Tuppence,

85
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,771
that's all I've got.

86
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,170
But I wouldn't give you daylight

87
00:07:22,862 --> 00:07:24,851
Come on, you little bastard!

88
00:07:26,783 --> 00:07:29,377
- Come on! Get in that van.
- Get in that van!

89
00:07:31,423 --> 00:07:33,014
(Engine starts)

90
00:07:37,262 --> 00:07:38,856
Are you ready, Ei?

91
00:07:43,582 --> 00:07:45,062
Here goes.

92
00:08:16,065 --> 00:08:17,656
(Laboured breathing)

93
00:08:38,345 --> 00:08:40,815
WOMAN: Ah, he was all right your dad

94
00:08:40,865 --> 00:08:44,142
EILEEN: You were the only one
who could get round llm

95
00:08:44,186 --> 00:08:46,259
WOMAN: What'll you give us for them Mr. D?

96
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:49,908
Micky, there your dad's working boots

97
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:51,938
I know, but we've just got to have five bob.

98
00:08:51,986 --> 00:08:54,707
- What for?
- Oh, Dad, we've just got to go to the dance.

99
00:08:54,749 --> 00:08:56,740
I don't know.

100
00:08:56,788 --> 00:08:58,586
You two are bleedin' dance mad.

101
00:08:58,629 --> 00:09:00,423
Oh, go on, Mr. D.

102
00:09:01,428 --> 00:09:03,022
Just five bob.

103
00:09:03,068 --> 00:09:04,741
Don't be snidey.

104
00:09:04,789 --> 00:09:06,698
All right.

105
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,068
I'll lend you the money.

106
00:09:09,107 --> 00:09:11,145
But take the boots back home. OK?

107
00:09:11,189 --> 00:09:12,986
Oh, thanks, Mr. D, you're a pal.

108
00:09:13,029 --> 00:09:14,145
Thanks, Dad.

109
00:09:14,189 --> 00:09:16,179
And be back here by 11.

110
00:09:18,868 --> 00:09:20,463
Bleedin' dance mad.

111
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:24,506
How are we fixed for a few ciggies, Mr. D?

112
00:09:24,549 --> 00:09:26,030
Out!

113
00:09:31,669 --> 00:09:33,979
DAD: Eileen! It's nearly 11 o‘clock

114
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:36,590
- OK, Dad.
- Just one last ciggie, Mr. D.

115
00:09:36,631 --> 00:09:38,585
I'll be in in a minute, Dad.

116
00:09:38,631 --> 00:09:40,268
You'll get me hung, you will.

117
00:09:47,191 --> 00:09:49,990
Isn't it terrible the way we've got to be in
by 11 o'clock.

118
00:09:50,032 --> 00:09:52,422
I know. It's worse than Alcatraz, isn't it?

119
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,865
DAD: Eileen! I won't tell you twice.

120
00:10:07,472 --> 00:10:10,544
Just a few more minutes, Mr. D,
and she'll be in, honest.

121
00:10:10,592 --> 00:10:13,106
Make sure it is only a few more minutes an' all.

122
00:10:16,433 --> 00:10:18,424
I'm sure I'm getting a brain tumour.

123
00:10:18,472 --> 00:10:21,068
Oh, Micky, behave, you're healthier than I am.

124
00:10:21,112 --> 00:10:23,833
No, honest, kid.
Me head's been banging for days.

125
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:26,434
- Eileen! What bleedin' time do you call this?
- Blimey.

126
00:10:26,472 --> 00:10:28,064
I'm coming, Dad, I'm coming.

127
00:10:28,112 --> 00:10:29,592
BOTH: See you, kid.

128
00:10:33,554 --> 00:10:35,544
Look what he's bought me.

129
00:10:37,232 --> 00:10:39,224
It's Chanel No.5.

130
00:10:39,275 --> 00:10:41,232
I Know

131
00:10:42,315 --> 00:10:43,631
Oh.

132
00:10:43,674 --> 00:10:45,666
Isn't that dead romantic?

133
00:10:51,756 --> 00:10:53,748
Before you are joined in matrimony,

134
00:10:53,796 --> 00:10:55,787
I have to remind both of you

135
00:10:55,835 --> 00:10:59,383
of the solemn and binding character
of the vows you are about to make.

136
00:10:59,436 --> 00:11:02,349
This marriage is the union of one man
with one woman

137
00:11:02,397 --> 00:11:06,912
freely entered into, for life,
to the exclusion of all others.

138
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,509
(Cheering)

139
00:11:10,677 --> 00:11:11,667
Ah!

140
00:11:13,197 --> 00:11:15,268
- (Giggling)
- In you come, Maisie.

141
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:19,268
(Laughter)

142
00:11:24,236 --> 00:11:25,635
PHOTOGRAPHER: Smile

143
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,990
ALL: Oh, oh

144
00:11:30,038 --> 00:11:31,836
Oh, what a gal

145
00:11:31,876 --> 00:11:34,073
There's none so classy

146
00:11:34,116 --> 00:11:36,313
As my fair lassie

147
00:11:36,356 --> 00:11:38,188
Oh, oh

148
00:11:38,237 --> 00:11:40,434
Oh, holy Moses, what a chassis

149
00:11:40,477 --> 00:11:42,467
She went riding

150
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,314
She didn't fall

151
00:11:44,357 --> 00:11:46,236
From the country

152
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,270
I was the one who had to walk

153
00:11:48,318 --> 00:11:52,313
If you knew Susie like I know Susie

154
00:11:52,357 --> 00:11:56,352
Oh, oh what a gal!

155
00:11:57,599 --> 00:11:59,794
My Yiddisher momma...
- (Woman shouts)

156
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,830
MAN : I, eh! No. Order now.

157
00:12:01,878 --> 00:12:05,589
...I miss her more than ever now...
- Order... Go on, Maisie. Go on.

158
00:12:06,599 --> 00:12:10,196
My Yiddisher momma

159
00:12:10,239 --> 00:12:14,792
I long to kiss her wrinkled brow

160
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,196
I long to hold her hand

161
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:23,792
As I did in days gone by

162
00:12:24,522 --> 00:12:27,720
And say I'm sorry

163
00:12:27,763 --> 00:12:32,072
For everything that made you cry

164
00:12:32,802 --> 00:12:35,793
How few were her pleasures

165
00:12:37,042 --> 00:12:38,918
She never cared ...

166
00:12:38,961 --> 00:12:40,953
I want me dad.

167
00:12:49,043 --> 00:12:51,352
I want me dad!

168
00:12:52,361 --> 00:12:54,352
(Agonised sobbing)

169
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:09,155
A CAPPELLA FEMALE VOICE:
In the bleak midwinter

170
00:13:09,203 --> 00:13:16,200
Frosty wind made moan

171
00:13:16,243 --> 00:13:23,515
Earth stood hard as iron

172
00:13:23,565 --> 00:13:30,564
Water like a stone

173
00:13:31,647 --> 00:13:38,916
Snow had fallen, snow on snow

174
00:13:39,566 --> 00:13:46,837
Snow on snow

175
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:55,197
In the bleak midwinter

176
00:13:56,047 --> 00:14:03,044
Long

177
00:14:03,088 --> 00:14:09,083
Ago

178
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:19,794
CHOIR: Our God, heaven cannot hold Him

179
00:14:19,847 --> 00:14:26,847
Nor earth sustain

180
00:14:26,886 --> 00:14:34,160
Heaven and earth shall flee away

181
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:41,205
When He comes to reign

182
00:14:42,609 --> 00:14:49,609
In the bleak midwinter

183
00:14:49,652 --> 00:14:56,648
A stable place sufficed

184
00:14:56,691 --> 00:15:06,202
The Lord God Almighty

185
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:12,087
Jesus Christ...

186
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:14,361
Say good night to your dad, kids.

187
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,403
Good night, Dad.

188
00:15:17,491 --> 00:15:19,083
Good night, kids.

189
00:15:19,131 --> 00:15:20,612
(Children giggle)

190
00:15:23,251 --> 00:15:30,524
What can I give Him

191
00:15:30,573 --> 00:15:37,844
Woeful as I am?

192
00:15:39,131 --> 00:15:46,814
If I were a shepherd

193
00:15:46,852 --> 00:15:55,489
I would bring a lamb

194
00:15:56,575 --> 00:16:01,570
If I were a wise man

195
00:16:01,614 --> 00:16:03,604
God bless, kids.

196
00:16:03,655 --> 00:16:09,490
I would do my part

197
00:16:09,537 --> 00:16:19,490
Yet what can I give Him?

198
00:16:20,135 --> 00:16:23,332
Give

199
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:29,611
My heart

200
00:16:30,337 --> 00:16:39,337
Give

201
00:16:39,376 --> 00:16:47,058
My heart

202
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:02,929
Nellie!

203
00:17:05,259 --> 00:17:07,251
Clean it up!

204
00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:09,290
(Laboured breathing)

205
00:17:28,742 --> 00:17:30,458
(Door slams, keys jangle)

206
00:17:30,501 --> 00:17:32,299
(Departing footsteps)

207
00:17:32,341 --> 00:17:34,331
MAN: Play Limelight, Scouse

208
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,973
(Plays)

209
00:18:10,904 --> 00:18:13,100
MAN: That's it, Scouse. Give us a tune.

210
00:18:13,144 --> 00:18:15,135
(Playing continues)

211
00:18:20,904 --> 00:18:25,216
- It was Schmeling, Scouse.
- You're wrong. Schmeling never won the title.

212
00:18:25,264 --> 00:18:27,255
The heavyweight champions were...

213
00:18:27,305 --> 00:18:29,615
Jack Sharkey, Primo Carnera,

214
00:18:29,665 --> 00:18:31,063
Braddock,

215
00:18:31,105 --> 00:18:32,504
Baer...

216
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:34,536
No, I tell a lie, Baer then Braddock.

217
00:18:35,264 --> 00:18:37,733
And then Joe Louis, who held that title till...

218
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:39,663
1948 from 193T.

219
00:18:39,706 --> 00:18:41,106
SOLDIER: Come on, Scouse.

220
00:18:41,146 --> 00:18:43,137
ALL: It takes a worried man

221
00:18:43,186 --> 00:18:45,541
To sing a worried song

222
00:18:45,587 --> 00:18:47,577
It takes a worried man

223
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,424
To sing a worried song

224
00:18:49,466 --> 00:18:52,664
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song

225
00:18:52,706 --> 00:18:56,495
I'm worried now, but I won't be worried long

226
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,299
Thanks for coming home, son.

227
00:19:08,907 --> 00:19:10,898
I got compassionate leave, Mam.

228
00:19:23,187 --> 00:19:24,588
Was

229
00:19:26,589 --> 00:19:27,988
...wrong...

230
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,388
...lad.

231
00:19:40,908 --> 00:19:42,308
OK, Dad.

232
00:19:46,071 --> 00:19:47,059
OK.

233
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:58,183
So wherever she may be

234
00:19:58,231 --> 00:20:03,101
Go bring her back to me

235
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:05,459
Roll along

236
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:08,219
Roll along

237
00:20:08,271 --> 00:20:12,900
Kentucky

238
00:20:12,952 --> 00:20:15,147
Moon

239
00:20:15,192 --> 00:20:16,591
More band!

240
00:20:16,631 --> 00:20:18,429
Whoopie!

241
00:20:18,473 --> 00:20:20,667
I like pickled onions

242
00:20:20,713 --> 00:20:22,986
I like pickled cabbage

243
00:20:23,032 --> 00:20:27,264
Piccalilli is all right with a bit of cold meat
on a Sunday night

244
00:20:27,312 --> 00:20:29,506
I like Tommy-a-toes

245
00:20:29,553 --> 00:20:31,032
But the best thing...

246
00:20:31,073 --> 00:20:34,189
- Your gran's in fine fettle.
- Just come back from the Isle of Man.

247
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:37,747
She should have stayed there.
She's just like me dad and I bleedin' hate her.

248
00:20:37,793 --> 00:20:41,149
GRAN: Whoopie!
AUNT: More bleeding punch!

249
00:20:50,074 --> 00:20:51,667
Don't fall Mam

250
00:20:51,715 --> 00:20:53,307
Please don't fall

251
00:21:01,915 --> 00:21:03,906
MAM: Why did you marry him, Mam?

252
00:21:06,596 --> 00:21:08,187
MAM: He was nice.

253
00:21:09,675 --> 00:21:11,666
He was a good dancer

254
00:21:12,995 --> 00:21:18,992
ELLA FITZGERALD: Here I go again

255
00:21:19,515 --> 00:21:25,512
I hear those trumpets blow again

256
00:21:26,236 --> 00:21:31,629
All aglow again

257
00:21:32,237 --> 00:21:39,234
Taking a chance on love

258
00:21:40,078 --> 00:21:45,675
Here I slide again

259
00:21:46,397 --> 00:21:52,394
About to take that ride again

260
00:21:53,158 --> 00:21:58,153
Starry-eyed again...

261
00:21:58,197 --> 00:22:00,759
- No! Never be like that!
- No! Tommy, no!

262
00:22:00,798 --> 00:22:02,790
Tommy, no! Please, Tommy!

263
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:04,432
Oh, Tommy, no!

264
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,275
Shut up. Shut up!

265
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,311
- Aaah!
- Shut up, shut up!

266
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,634
(Shrieks)

267
00:22:09,678 --> 00:22:10,953
Shut up!

268
00:22:11,959 --> 00:22:17,794
I never would try

269
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:23,992
But now I'm taking the game up

270
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,520
(Sobbing)

271
00:22:25,561 --> 00:22:31,555
And the ace of hearts is high

272
00:22:32,561 --> 00:22:37,554
Things are mending now

273
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:44,918
I see a rainbow blending now

274
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:51,438
We'll have a happy ending now

275
00:22:51,483 --> 00:22:57,273
Taking a chance on love

276
00:23:19,244 --> 00:23:21,235
If anything happens to my mum...

277
00:23:22,924 --> 00:23:24,721
...I’ll bleedin' kill you.

278
00:23:27,924 --> 00:23:30,642
TONY: Go on, Ma-sy, give us Barefoot Days

279
00:23:30,965 --> 00:23:33,399
Barefoot days

280
00:23:33,444 --> 00:23:36,834
When we were just a couple of kids

281
00:23:38,245 --> 00:23:40,839
Barefoot days

282
00:23:40,885 --> 00:23:43,683
And all the things we did

283
00:23:44,524 --> 00:23:46,993
ALL: We'd go down to a shady nook

284
00:23:47,726 --> 00:23:50,477
Use a bent pin for a hook

285
00:23:51,205 --> 00:23:54,562
And we'd fish all day, we'd fish all night

286
00:23:54,607 --> 00:23:57,963
But the goddamn fish refused to bite

287
00:23:58,006 --> 00:24:00,725
And then we'd slide

288
00:24:00,766 --> 00:24:04,554
Down someone's backyard door

289
00:24:05,285 --> 00:24:07,482
Slide and slide

290
00:24:07,525 --> 00:24:11,679
Till our pants was tore

291
00:24:11,727 --> 00:24:13,718
Then we'd have to go home

292
00:24:13,767 --> 00:24:15,324
We'd have to go to bed

293
00:24:15,368 --> 00:24:18,803
While our mother got busy
with the needle and thread

294
00:24:18,848 --> 00:24:20,326
Oh, boy

295
00:24:20,368 --> 00:24:25,965
What joy we had in barefoot days

296
00:24:36,928 --> 00:24:38,918
Make sure there's room in there.

297
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:46,241
(Air-raid siren)

298
00:25:01,649 --> 00:25:04,245
Tommy, where are the kids?
Where are the kids?

299
00:25:06,169 --> 00:25:08,160
(Siren still sounds)

300
00:25:17,211 --> 00:25:19,203
(Drone of aeroplane)

301
00:25:20,211 --> 00:25:22,328
(Whistle of fourth bomb)

302
00:25:28,932 --> 00:25:30,923
Come in. Come in.

303
00:25:33,332 --> 00:25:35,448
Where the bleedin' hell have you been?

304
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,888
- They're getting closer!
- They're gonna bomb us!

305
00:25:46,373 --> 00:25:48,250
Sing, Eileen.

306
00:25:48,293 --> 00:25:49,521
Sing.

307
00:25:50,533 --> 00:25:53,331
(Drone of aeroplane engine)
Roll out the barrel

308
00:25:54,333 --> 00:25:57,245
We'll have a barrel of fun
(Distant explosion)

309
00:25:58,774 --> 00:26:01,765
(Rest join in hesitantly) Roll out the barrel

310
00:26:01,813 --> 00:26:05,011
We've got the blues on the run

311
00:26:06,334 --> 00:26:09,531
Zing boom tararrel

312
00:26:10,414 --> 00:26:13,406
We'll have a song of good cheer

313
00:26:13,454 --> 00:26:14,934
(Distant explosions)

314
00:26:14,976 --> 00:26:17,648
Now's the time to roll the barrel

315
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:22,011
Cos the gang's all here

316
00:26:36,936 --> 00:26:38,529
How are you, Ei?

317
00:26:39,936 --> 00:26:41,334
OK, Mam.

318
00:26:56,937 --> 00:26:58,928
What's scarlet fever, Mam?

319
00:27:00,417 --> 00:27:02,408
It's scarlatina, love.

320
00:27:03,937 --> 00:27:05,417
Scarlatina.

321
00:27:12,498 --> 00:27:14,490
Where's our Tony, Mam?

322
00:27:35,939 --> 00:27:37,930
Why can't I come in, Dad?

323
00:27:39,139 --> 00:27:41,130
There's no place for you here.

324
00:27:42,939 --> 00:27:44,339
Frig off!

325
00:28:03,822 --> 00:28:05,813
(Dog barks)

326
00:28:17,182 --> 00:28:19,778
- Can I stay here Gran?
- You can have the sofa

327
00:28:21,583 --> 00:28:26,783
GIRLS: If I should die before I wake
pray the Lord my soul to take

328
00:28:26,822 --> 00:28:31,135
God bless Mother, God bless Father,
and keep them safe

329
00:28:40,944 --> 00:28:43,332
If you look into a mirror after midnight...

330
00:28:46,344 --> 00:28:47,937
...you'll see the devil.

331
00:28:50,225 --> 00:28:54,616
Oh, when Irish eyes are smiling

332
00:28:56,626 --> 00:29:00,776
All the world is bright and gay

333
00:29:01,985 --> 00:29:05,183
In the lilt of Irish laughter

334
00:29:06,627 --> 00:29:09,300
When Irish hearts are happy

335
00:29:11,026 --> 00:29:14,814
When Irish hearts are happy

336
00:29:16,506 --> 00:29:20,294
All the world is bright and gay

337
00:29:21,947 --> 00:29:23,586
In the lilt

338
00:29:23,628 --> 00:29:25,618
Of Irish laughter

339
00:29:26,947 --> 00:29:28,937
(Dad whistles melody)

340
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:35,577
When Irish hearts are happy

341
00:29:38,227 --> 00:29:40,219
(Continues whistling)

342
00:29:43,029 --> 00:29:45,384
BOTH: R-A-G-M-O-P-P-P. Ragmop!

343
00:29:45,428 --> 00:29:48,544
BOTH: One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight. Ragmop!

344
00:29:53,309 --> 00:29:54,582
God!

345
00:29:54,629 --> 00:29:56,108
Isn't it hot?

346
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:59,101
I'm sweating past meself.

347
00:29:59,149 --> 00:30:01,139
Oh, here's Red.

348
00:30:01,188 --> 00:30:03,497
Oh, God, that's all I need.

349
00:30:03,549 --> 00:30:05,745
Aw, he's harmless.

350
00:30:11,469 --> 00:30:13,062
Hiya, Mick.

351
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,829
Die!

352
00:30:16,751 --> 00:30:18,742
Oh, what you're throwing away.

353
00:30:18,791 --> 00:30:21,351
(Laughs) God help him, the poor gobshite.

354
00:30:24,951 --> 00:30:26,942
Do you remember Formby?

355
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:28,550
And that tent?

356
00:30:28,591 --> 00:30:30,388
Oh, cor blimey.

357
00:30:31,391 --> 00:30:33,461
MICKY: I never
You did

358
00:30:33,512 --> 00:30:34,863
I never

359
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:36,981
- You did.
- I never.

360
00:30:37,032 --> 00:30:38,622
You did fart!

361
00:30:42,232 --> 00:30:43,221
Uh...

362
00:30:45,472 --> 00:30:46,951
I never.

363
00:30:46,993 --> 00:30:50,507
- I thought you'd killed her, you know, Micky.
- I know. So did I.

364
00:30:51,671 --> 00:30:55,382
When I think about it,
I was a real cow with that mallet, wasn't I?

365
00:30:55,433 --> 00:30:57,424
- Do you ever see Jingles?
- No.

366
00:30:57,473 --> 00:30:59,464
Not since she married Les.

367
00:31:00,473 --> 00:31:02,668
'S wonderful!

368
00:31:03,673 --> 00:31:05,664
BOTH: 'S marvellous!

369
00:31:05,713 --> 00:31:07,305
Jingles, you came!

370
00:31:09,072 --> 00:31:13,386
ALL: They tried to sell us egg foo yung!

371
00:31:13,434 --> 00:31:15,425
- So, how are you, kid?
- Smashing.

372
00:31:15,474 --> 00:31:17,465
- Are you still married?
- Oh, God, yeah.

373
00:31:17,514 --> 00:31:19,505
Two kids and a radiogram to support.

374
00:31:19,553 --> 00:31:23,785
- You haven't altered, Ei. Still not a pick on you.
- Still eight stone soaking wet.

375
00:31:23,833 --> 00:31:25,587
- How do you do it?
- Witchcraft!

376
00:31:25,635 --> 00:31:29,264
- You're hooking with Mick
- Oh Jingles I'm in a worse state than Russia

377
00:31:29,314 --> 00:31:30,714
(Laughter)

378
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:34,064
Do you know who I saw in The Swan
last week? Jackie McGorrie

379
00:31:34,116 --> 00:31:35,911
Remember when ...

380
00:31:35,955 --> 00:31:38,343
(Intro music drowns conversation)

381
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:41,273
Cos I love you that's why

382
00:31:41,314 --> 00:31:43,307
Whoa, it's Saturday

383
00:31:43,357 --> 00:31:45,995
That's why.
Yeah, it's Saturday

384
00:31:46,036 --> 00:31:49,028
Cos I love you that's why

385
00:31:49,076 --> 00:31:50,873
Oh, kiss me, you fool

386
00:31:50,916 --> 00:31:52,714
That's why

387
00:31:52,756 --> 00:31:54,349
(Knock at door)

388
00:31:54,397 --> 00:31:55,876
That's him.

389
00:31:55,916 --> 00:31:57,908
Bet he's come in a taxi.

390
00:31:57,956 --> 00:31:59,947
Well, you know these seamen.

391
00:31:59,997 --> 00:32:01,590
Money's no object.

392
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:21,750
I've signed meself out of hospital.

393
00:32:24,957 --> 00:32:26,551
I've walked home.

394
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,517
He's gone.

395
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,953
My Tommy's gone.

396
00:33:24,763 --> 00:33:26,754
Won't you say ta-ra, Dad?

397
00:33:38,644 --> 00:33:40,634
I'm only going for the season.

398
00:33:55,563 --> 00:33:57,156
Do you know what?

399
00:33:58,444 --> 00:34:01,561
If I ever get a gun,
I'll blow your bleedin' brains out.

400
00:34:06,324 --> 00:34:07,804
Ta-ra, Mam!

401
00:34:07,844 --> 00:34:09,120
Bye, love!

402
00:34:09,165 --> 00:34:11,235
Don't forget to write, now, will you?

403
00:34:17,966 --> 00:34:19,558
Have a ciggie, kid.

404
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:31,683
I put a nickel in the telephone

405
00:34:31,726 --> 00:34:33,717
To dial my baby's number

406
00:34:33,766 --> 00:34:37,158
Got a brr-brr-brr-brr busy line

407
00:34:37,206 --> 00:34:39,482
Pwllheli, here we come!

408
00:35:21,891 --> 00:35:23,926
(Takes orders)

409
00:35:23,971 --> 00:35:25,370
Yes, please.

410
00:35:30,011 --> 00:35:32,002
What would you like to order, sir?

411
00:35:36,371 --> 00:35:38,363
MAM: Please come home, Ei

412
00:35:38,412 --> 00:35:40,002
Your dad's really ill.

413
00:35:41,971 --> 00:35:43,290
One?

414
00:35:43,331 --> 00:35:44,319
OK.

415
00:36:30,174 --> 00:36:32,769
MICKY: East is east and west is west

416
00:36:32,814 --> 00:36:35,409
And the wrong one I have chose

417
00:36:35,455 --> 00:36:38,333
Let's go where they keep on wearin'

418
00:36:38,374 --> 00:36:41,174
Those rings and things and buttons and bows

419
00:36:41,216 --> 00:36:45,004
Flowers and frills and buttons and bows

420
00:36:45,056 --> 00:36:48,047
Don't bury me in this prairie

421
00:36:48,096 --> 00:36:50,815
Take me where the ce-ment grows

422
00:36:50,855 --> 00:36:53,165
Let's get down to some big town

423
00:36:53,216 --> 00:36:55,606
Where they judge a gal
by the cut of her clothes

424
00:36:55,656 --> 00:36:59,650
And you'll stand out in buttons and bows

425
00:36:59,697 --> 00:37:02,814
I love you in buck skin

426
00:37:02,856 --> 00:37:05,325
Or the skirts that you've homespun

427
00:37:05,375 --> 00:37:07,572
But I'll love you longer, stronger

428
00:37:07,616 --> 00:37:10,415
Where your friends don't tote a gun

429
00:37:10,458 --> 00:37:13,052
My bones denounce the buckboard bounce

430
00:37:13,098 --> 00:37:15,373
And the cactus hurts my toes

431
00:37:15,418 --> 00:37:18,091
Let's vamoose where gals keep usin'

432
00:37:18,138 --> 00:37:20,605
Those silks and satins and linen that shows

433
00:37:20,658 --> 00:37:24,651
And you're all mine in buttons and bows

434
00:37:24,698 --> 00:37:27,212
Gimme Eastern trimmin'
where women are women

435
00:37:27,259 --> 00:37:29,647
In high-silk hose and peek-a-boo clothes

436
00:37:29,699 --> 00:37:31,894
And French perfume that rocks the room

437
00:37:31,939 --> 00:37:33,930
And you're all mine

438
00:37:33,979 --> 00:37:37,096
(Girls take a deep breath) Bows!

439
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,499
Well, Ei...

440
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,851
You're well and truly married now.

441
00:38:03,301 --> 00:38:04,290
Yes.

442
00:38:06,981 --> 00:38:09,096
But I don't feel any different, Maisie.

443
00:38:12,101 --> 00:38:14,093
I don't feel any different.

444
00:38:16,341 --> 00:38:18,060
Don't be worrying.

445
00:38:18,102 --> 00:38:19,694
You'll be all right.

446
00:38:32,382 --> 00:38:34,374
MAM: They soon grow up

447
00:38:35,382 --> 00:38:37,374
Maisie is engaged to George Roughley

448
00:38:37,423 --> 00:38:41,052
and I don't think it'll be long
before our Tony marries Rosie Forsyth.

449
00:38:52,984 --> 00:38:54,383
(Sighs)

450
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:59,098
(Wearily) I'll leave the place till morning.

451
00:39:00,105 --> 00:39:02,096
(Drum roll crescendo)

452
00:39:06,585 --> 00:39:09,337
SOPRANO: Ah ah

453
00:39:36,346 --> 00:39:40,738
SOPRANO CONTINUES:
Aah aah aah aah aah-aah

454
00:39:54,668 --> 00:39:57,261
SOPRANO CONTINUES: Aah aah-aah

455
00:40:04,189 --> 00:40:06,180
MAM: I love the light nights.

456
00:40:07,509 --> 00:40:10,979
MAISIE: But they're starting to draw in now
aren't they Mam?

457
00:40:12,749 --> 00:40:13,738
Yeah

458
00:40:13,788 --> 00:40:15,586
(Rumble of thunder)

459
00:40:15,629 --> 00:40:17,028
DAD: Nellie?

460
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:20,979
Nellie!

461
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:27,659
Nell!

462
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:35,948
EILEEN: Sorry about the mess Mam

463
00:40:35,991 --> 00:40:38,585
- Ah thanks Mam
MICKY: See you Mrs. D Ta-ra

464
00:40:39,991 --> 00:40:41,709

465
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:51,911
LES: You're married now! I'm your husband!
Your duty's to me! Frig everyone else!

466
00:40:52,912 --> 00:40:56,188

467
00:41:07,313 --> 00:41:09,303
MAM: Come on. Up the dancers

468
00:41:09,352 --> 00:41:11,343
(Children giggle)

469
00:41:18,473 --> 00:41:21,591
MAM: How much do you love me?
CHILDREN: A pound of sugar!

470
00:41:23,794 --> 00:41:28,504
MAM: Hush a bowee, hush a bow

471
00:41:29,274 --> 00:41:33,745
Hush-a-bowee hush-a-bow

472
00:41:34,514 --> 00:41:38,986
Hush-a-bowee hush-a-bow

MAM: Good night, son.

476
00:41:58,556 --> 00:42:00,547
The Sandman is coming.

477
00:42:08,997 --> 00:42:10,988
How much do you love me?

478
00:42:23,998 --> 00:42:30,995
CHOIR: Of one that is so fair and bright

479
00:42:31,038 --> 00:42:37,671
Velut maris stella

480
00:42:38,439 --> 00:42:45,435
Brighter than the day is light

481
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:51,712
Parens et puella

482
00:42:51,759 --> 00:42:55,355
I cry to thee
- (Woman cries out)

483
00:42:55,399 --> 00:42:59,393
Thou see to me

484
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,712
Lady

485
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:07,995
Pray thy Son for me

486
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:12,034
Tam pia

487
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:16,393
That I may come to thee

488
00:43:16,441 --> 00:43:20,036
Aaah-aah-aah!

489
00:43:20,081 --> 00:43:22,275
Maria...

490
00:43:22,321 --> 00:43:26,201
- What do you ask of the Church of God?
PARENTS AND GODPARENTS: Faith

491
00:43:26,241 --> 00:43:28,232
And what does faith hold out to you?

492
00:43:28,281 --> 00:43:29,874
Life everlasting

493
00:43:29,922 --> 00:43:33,118
- Do you renounce Satan?

494
00:43:33,162 --> 00:43:36,154

DICKIE VALENTINE:
Someone broke into my heart

508
00:44:20,605 --> 00:44:22,993
And stole a beat or two

509
00:44:23,725 --> 00:44:28,720
The finger of suspicion points at you

510
00:44:30,006 --> 00:44:36,000
Someone took away my sleep
and never left a clue

511
00:44:36,046 --> 00:44:41,038
The finger of suspicion points at you

512
00:44:42,685 --> 00:44:47,886
Just as soon as they can make
the guilty one confess

513
00:44:48,647 --> 00:44:54,882
I know exactly what I'm gonna do

514
00:44:54,927 --> 00:44:56,918

00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:01,761

00:46:03,732 --> 00:46:07,360
A sweet little lady, I guess

532
00:46:08,371 --> 00:46:10,647

You lovable dreamboat

538
00:47:09,016 --> 00:47:11,610
The kisses you gave me

539
00:47:12,776 --> 00:47:15,574
Set my dreams afloat

540
00:47:23,375 --> 00:47:24,569
Maisie!

541
00:47:31,777 --> 00:47:33,971
I would sail

542
00:47:34,697 --> 00:47:36,973
The seven seas with you

543
00:47:38,298 --> 00:47:43,247
Even if you told me to go
and paddle my own canoe

544
00:47:44,258 --> 00:47:45,737
Sincerely

545
00:47:46,738 --> 00:47:48,729

00:47:59,699 --> 00:48:01,815
Have you come to mind the baby Doreen?

548
00:48:01,857 --> 00:48:03,690
- Yeah.
- Come in then love.

549
00:48:04,699 --> 00:48:08,375
EILEEN:
Brown-skin girl stay home and mind baby

550
00:48:08,419 --> 00:48:12,015
Brown-skin girl, stay home and mind baby

551
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:15,696
Brown-skin girl, stay home and mind baby

552
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:19,493
Oh, I killed nobody but my husband

553
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:22,409
ALL: He's stone-cold dead in the market

554
00:48:22,941 --> 00:48:25,295
He's stone-cold dead in the market

555
00:48:25,741 --> 00:48:28,096
He's stone-cold dead in the market

556
00:48:28,141 --> 00:48:31,132
Oh, I killed nobody but my husband

557
00:48:31,701 --> 00:48:34,692
Brown-skin girl, stay home and mind baby

558
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:38,618
Brown-skin girl, stay home and mind baby

559
00:48:38,662 --> 00:48:41,779
I'm going away on a Harrison boat

560
00:48:41,822 --> 00:48:43,813
And if I don't come back

561
00:48:43,861 --> 00:48:46,057
Stay home and mind

562
00:48:46,102 --> 00:48:49,697
The baby!

563
00:48:49,741 --> 00:48:52,461
ALL: Oh my what a rotten song

564
00:48:52,502 --> 00:48:55,893
What a rotten song what a rotten song
- A rum and black, a shandy.

565
00:48:55,942 --> 00:48:58,900
Oh my what a rotten song
- A Black & Tan, pint of mild, pint of bitter.

566
00:48:58,942 --> 00:49:01,900
And what a rotten singer too!
- Pint of mixed. Thanks, love.

567
00:49:01,942 --> 00:49:04,696
Hello, George.
We've come to wet the baby's head.

568
00:49:04,743 --> 00:49:07,415
- Hello. What's it like being a dad, eh?
- Made up.

569
00:49:07,462 --> 00:49:08,942
What are you having?

570
00:49:09,022 --> 00:49:14,223
When that old gang of mine

571
00:49:14,264 --> 00:49:17,540
Get together

572
00:49:18,064 --> 00:49:25,745
On the corner of my home town

573
00:49:26,384 --> 00:49:30,537
We were friends in the past

574
00:49:30,985 --> 00:49:35,297
And our friendship will last

575
00:49:35,825 --> 00:49:42,823
Till the curtain of dreams comes down

576
00:49:44,226 --> 00:49:48,777
When that old gang of mine

577
00:49:48,826 --> 00:49:52,022
MAM: I borrow 25 pounds
from the Lehigh & Lend every Christmas

578
00:49:52,066 --> 00:49:54,259
then pay it back over the next 12 months.

579
00:49:54,306 --> 00:49:56,104
It's like a tontine, really.

580
00:50:05,906 --> 00:50:08,102
Royal Liver
MAM: Come in, Mr. Spaull.

581
00:50:15,067 --> 00:50:18,264
Can I surrender the policies
on the two girls, Mr. Spaull?

582
00:50:18,308 --> 00:50:20,105
Certainly, Mrs. Davies.

583
00:50:23,427 --> 00:50:25,895
You've had these some time now, haven't you?

584
00:50:25,948 --> 00:50:28,065
Since they were babies.

585
00:50:28,109 --> 00:50:31,419
But as they're both married now,
there's no point in keeping them on.

586
00:50:31,469 --> 00:50:33,424
All right, Mrs. Davies.

587
00:50:33,469 --> 00:50:35,221
I'll take them into the office for you.

588
00:50:35,269 --> 00:50:36,861
Thank s, Mr. Spaull.

589
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:38,899
- Ta-ra
- See you next week.

590
00:50:40,388 --> 00:50:41,788
- Tony?
- Yeah?

591
00:50:41,828 --> 00:50:45,618
I‘m just running to confession
Will you pay the club man for me if he comes?

592
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:47,069
OK, Mam.

593
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:50,420
ALL: ... that old gang of mine

594
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:54,019
Gets together

595
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:59,302
Well, there's never a care

596
00:50:59,351 --> 00:51:03,343
Or a frown

597
00:51:03,991 --> 00:51:09,384
We will sing Sweet Adeline

598
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:16,147
Say goodbye to Auld Lang Syne

599
00:51:16,192 --> 00:51:19,389
On the corner

600
00:51:19,431 --> 00:51:26,429
Of my home town

601
00:51:26,471 --> 00:51:29,270
- And how much did she weigh?
- Just over seven pounds.

602
00:51:29,312 --> 00:51:31,383
- She was a big baby, wasn't she?
- Yeah.

603
00:51:31,432 --> 00:51:34,026
- Did you have her at Mill Road?
- Yeah, on the 6th.

604
00:51:34,073 --> 00:51:36,064
- What have you called her?
- Elaine.

605
00:51:36,113 --> 00:51:37,592
Aw, God love her.

606
00:51:37,633 --> 00:51:39,624
How do you like being a gran, Mrs. D?

607
00:51:39,673 --> 00:51:41,788
I wouldn't be without her. Well, she's me first.

608
00:51:41,833 --> 00:51:45,622
- Well Maisie, I'd better be making tracks.
- Thanks for coming, Margie.

609
00:51:45,674 --> 00:51:47,471
- I'll see you.
- See you, Maisie.

610
00:51:47,514 --> 00:51:49,310
- See you, Mrs. D.
- Ta-ra love

611
00:51:51,034 --> 00:51:53,308
You've known Margie for some years now.

612
00:51:53,354 --> 00:51:55,822
Yeah we've all been mates since school.

613
00:51:55,873 --> 00:51:57,864
Margie, meself and Vera Large.

614
00:51:57,913 --> 00:52:00,587
- Vera's a nice girl, isn't she?
- Aw, smashing.

615
00:52:00,634 --> 00:52:03,274
Maisie Davies, you dirty mare.

616
00:52:03,315 --> 00:52:04,587
Oh, hiya, Micky.

617
00:52:04,634 --> 00:52:06,705
- Hiya Mrs. D
- You're looking well, Mick.

618
00:52:06,755 --> 00:52:09,144
I know. The face that launched
a thousand ships.

619
00:52:09,194 --> 00:52:11,185
- The other way.
- That's wicked, that.

620
00:52:11,235 --> 00:52:14,113
Being married to you.
No wonder me poor face is destroyed.

621
00:52:14,154 --> 00:52:16,714
If I'd played me cards right
I'd be in America now.

622
00:52:16,756 --> 00:52:20,066
Remember that Yank I went out with, Mrs. D?
He thought I had lovely eyes.

623
00:52:20,116 --> 00:52:22,835
Hated the rest of me,
but thought I had lovely eyes!

624
00:52:22,875 --> 00:52:24,866
And I end up by falling for a dwarf.

625
00:52:24,915 --> 00:52:26,986
There's no justice you know, is there?

626
00:52:27,036 --> 00:52:28,627
Chocolate eyes

627
00:52:28,676 --> 00:52:30,667
Those great big chocolate eyes!

628
00:52:30,716 --> 00:52:32,514
Get your hands off my body.

629
00:52:32,557 --> 00:52:35,549
You have only got one tonsil,
but I love you all the same.

630
00:52:35,596 --> 00:52:37,633
Don't make mock of Mick, you bastard!

631
00:52:37,677 --> 00:52:40,587
Now, you know you love
the bones of him, really.

632
00:52:40,636 --> 00:52:41,625
Oh-oh-oh!

633
00:52:41,677 --> 00:52:43,668
The walking hormone? Oh, you fool!

634
00:52:46,237 --> 00:52:48,229
- A Pound a man, is it?
DAVE: 'Ere Mick

635
00:52:48,278 --> 00:52:49,676
Sit here.

636
00:52:50,678 --> 00:52:52,077
Thanks, Dave.

637
00:52:52,118 --> 00:52:55,906
- Go the match yesterday?
- Oh, you're not talking about football again?

638
00:52:55,958 --> 00:52:57,437
Behave, will you?

639
00:52:57,478 --> 00:52:59,149
Football mad.

640
00:52:59,198 --> 00:53:01,995
Aren't they all? Look at that thing I'm married to.

641
00:53:02,038 --> 00:53:05,110
He gets more worked up over a set of fixtures
than me in me nude.

642
00:53:05,159 --> 00:53:08,150
Do you know what?
If I was a centre forward, I'd be laughing.

643
00:53:08,199 --> 00:53:10,633
- What are you having, blossom?
- A rum and pep, love.

644
00:53:10,679 --> 00:53:12,670
- And then you.
- He should be so lucky!

645
00:53:12,719 --> 00:53:14,710
Eh, Dave, will you get us some ciggies?

646
00:53:14,759 --> 00:53:16,476
- Craven A?
- Or Park Drive.

647
00:53:16,519 --> 00:53:17,508
OK.

648
00:53:17,558 --> 00:53:19,948
- What's your poison, Red?
- A bitter, thanks, Dave.

649
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:26,031
... The League Division One

650
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:28,714
Birmingham City three - Manchester City three.

651
00:53:28,759 --> 00:53:31,069
Fulham three - West Bromwich Ahbion two.

652
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:34,468
Preston North End two - Blackpool three.

653
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:36,830
Everton two - West Ham United nil.

654
00:53:37,841 --> 00:53:39,832
Leicester City nil - Leeds United two.

655
00:53:40,841 --> 00:53:43,230
Manchester United three -
Nottingham Forest one.

656
00:53:44,121 --> 00:53:45,918
Division Two: Brighton ...

657
00:53:45,961 --> 00:53:47,553
EILEEN: Any luck?

658
00:53:47,601 --> 00:53:50,752
- No, I couldn't pick me nose.
- Bristol City three - Hull City one.

659
00:53:50,802 --> 00:53:52,281
Charlton Athletic nil ...

660
00:53:55,042 --> 00:53:58,432
If you want me,
I'll either be at May Tobin's or at The Grapes.

661
00:54:00,082 --> 00:54:01,799
In Phythian Street?

662
00:54:01,842 --> 00:54:02,831
Yeah.

663
00:54:04,002 --> 00:54:06,801
Eh, Gran! Have you got a shilling
for two tanners?

664
00:54:06,843 --> 00:54:09,038
There's enough money in the meter.

665
00:54:09,083 --> 00:54:13,201
EILEEN: She never haves enough gas
and the bleedin' thing always goes.

666
00:54:13,243 --> 00:54:14,516
MAM: Well ...

667
00:54:16,843 --> 00:54:18,834
Here you are, love. I've got one.

668
00:54:19,843 --> 00:54:20,832
No.

669
00:54:21,844 --> 00:54:23,243
Thanks, Mam.

670
00:54:26,524 --> 00:54:28,515
Isn't she an old cow?

671
00:54:28,564 --> 00:54:30,555
How can you live with her, Ei?

672
00:54:30,604 --> 00:54:35,200
Beggars can‘t be choosers, Maisie. You know
how hard it is to get a place of your own.

673
00:54:35,243 --> 00:54:36,836
(Elaine gurgles)

674
00:54:38,845 --> 00:54:41,040
Did you get anything for a sarnie, love?

675
00:54:41,085 --> 00:54:43,962
Yeah, I got a quarter of corned beef and a loaf.

676
00:54:44,005 --> 00:54:46,360
Oh, and four Devon Delights.

677
00:54:46,404 --> 00:54:48,043
I've just made a pot of tea.

678
00:54:52,645 --> 00:54:54,841
- Has she been good, Mam?
- Good as gold.

679
00:54:58,046 --> 00:55:02,163
And it's Come To Daddy, striding away now
towards the line, Seascape in second place,

680
00:55:02,206 --> 00:55:06,757
Bali Hai is third and these are well clear of the
remainder, All Serene running into fourth place.

681
00:55:06,806 --> 00:55:11,437
But Come To Daddy is the winner. Seascape is
second, Bali Hai is third and fourth All Serene.

682
00:55:11,487 --> 00:55:16,481
And so the result of the 1959 Cesarewitch
is first, Come to Daddy,

683
00:55:16,527 --> 00:55:22,317
owned by Mr. TH Farr, trained by Wilfred Lyde
and ridden by Doug Smith.

684
00:55:22,366 --> 00:55:27,156
Second was Seascape,
owned by Mr. Jim Jewell, trained by Jed Leader

685
00:55:27,208 --> 00:55:30,325
and ridden by claiming apprentice Ron Singer

686
00:55:30,368 --> 00:55:32,802
- And third was Bali Hai ...
EILEEN: We‘re back!

687
00:55:32,848 --> 00:55:35,520
- Any pea whack, Mam?
- Yeah, I’ve made a pan.

688
00:55:35,567 --> 00:55:38,036
- Did you back the winner?
- The donkeys I do?

689
00:55:38,087 --> 00:55:40,841
It had three legs. It's probably still running.

690
00:55:40,888 --> 00:55:42,481
... was All Serene ...

691
00:55:57,929 --> 00:55:59,726
Your tea's in the oven, son.

692
00:56:06,650 --> 00:56:10,040
- Are you going to come and have yours, Mam?
- I’ll be in in a minute lad.

693
00:56:14,450 --> 00:56:15,850
OK, Mam.

694
00:56:18,051 --> 00:56:23,842
She was a girl
and the only girl her daddy ever had

695
00:56:24,371 --> 00:56:27,842
A real old-fashioned girl, with eyes so true

696
00:56:27,891 --> 00:56:30,486
I could love nobody else but you

697
00:56:30,531 --> 00:56:32,806
Oh-oh-oh, I want a girl

698
00:56:32,852 --> 00:56:37,243
Just like the girl that married dear old dad

699
00:56:40,092 --> 00:56:41,571
Did you enjoy it?

700
00:56:41,612 --> 00:56:43,205
Yeah, very much.

701
00:56:45,373 --> 00:56:49,127
- Come on, Les, just one drink.
- All right, just one, to wet the baby's head.

702
00:56:49,173 --> 00:56:52,324
- But we're not staying here all fucking night.
- OK, Les, OK.

703
00:56:52,373 --> 00:56:53,964
...seen it on telly.

704
00:56:54,973 --> 00:56:56,769
She wouldn't let us out.

705
00:56:58,694 --> 00:57:00,525
- Hiya.
- Hello, love.

706
00:57:00,574 --> 00:57:02,962
- Hiya, Les, mate.
- Having a bevvy or what?

707
00:57:04,453 --> 00:57:06,843
A pint of bitter, and a gin and orange for her.

708
00:57:06,893 --> 00:57:08,486
I've got it. I've got it.

709
00:57:08,534 --> 00:57:10,525
So, how's it going, Red?

710
00:57:12,453 --> 00:57:15,447
GIRLS:
We‘re all together again, so here we are

711
00:57:16,255 --> 00:57:19,133
We‘re all together again, so here we are

712
00:57:19,174 --> 00:57:21,370
And the Lord knows when

713
00:57:21,413 --> 00:57:23,404
We'll be together again

714
00:57:23,453 --> 00:57:26,447
We're all together again, so here we are

715
00:57:26,975 --> 00:57:31,527
I'd give the world to start all over

716
00:57:31,576 --> 00:57:34,772
Back in the old routine

717
00:57:34,816 --> 00:57:39,207
To live my life in fields of clover

718
00:57:39,256 --> 00:57:42,134
Back in the old routine

719
00:57:42,176 --> 00:57:46,328
Give me an old straw hat
and a double truckin'

720
00:57:46,377 --> 00:57:48,095
Down the avenue...

721
00:57:49,616 --> 00:57:51,607
Oh, Jingles, don't get so upset

722
00:57:51,656 --> 00:57:53,136
Aw, come on.

723
00:57:54,217 --> 00:57:56,208
No, I'm all right, honest.

724
00:57:56,257 --> 00:57:59,168
It's just Les.
You know what he's like when he turns.

725
00:57:59,217 --> 00:58:02,335
The bastard!
For two pins, I'd go over there and tell him.

726
00:58:02,377 --> 00:58:04,607
- No, don't say anything.
- They‘re all the same

727
00:58:04,658 --> 00:58:08,252
When they're not using their big stick,
they're farting. Aren't men horrible?

728
00:58:11,258 --> 00:58:12,247
Eh!

729
00:58:13,618 --> 00:58:15,370
Come on!

730
00:58:15,417 --> 00:58:18,377
- Oh you‘re not going are you, Jingles?
- I think Les wants to.

731
00:58:18,418 --> 00:58:20,214
But you've only been here five minutes.

732
00:58:20,259 --> 00:58:21,578
Come on.

733
00:58:21,618 --> 00:58:24,496
I feel like going over there and bursting him.

734
00:58:24,538 --> 00:58:26,848
I'd better go, Ei. See you, Micky.

735
00:58:31,659 --> 00:58:33,377
- Never mind, girl.
- See you, Tone.

736
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:35,732
Poor Jingles.

737
00:58:35,779 --> 00:58:38,930
You sit there. It's none of your business.
Don't get involved.

738
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:41,174
You callous bleeder! That's my friend, that.

739
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:43,654
You men, you're all the bleedin' same.
Only think of yourselves.

740
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:48,058
Don't you tell me what I think.
No-one knows what's going on inside my mind.

741
00:58:48,101 --> 00:58:49,216
Including you.

742
00:58:49,261 --> 00:58:51,900
- Heck, heck! What's going on?
- Nothing.

743
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:54,774
- You know how she flies off the handle for the least thing.
- I don't.

744
00:58:54,821 --> 00:58:56,652
I've got good cause to, you shit-house!

745
00:58:56,701 --> 00:58:58,578
Now, come on, we don't want any upset.

746
00:58:58,621 --> 00:59:00,815
EILEEN: OK, Mam.
DAVE: OK, Nell.

747
00:59:00,861 --> 00:59:02,852
We're here to enjoy ourselves.

748
00:59:04,502 --> 00:59:06,493
Come on, Micky, give us a song.

749
00:59:07,781 --> 00:59:10,899
Pack up all my care and woe

750
00:59:10,941 --> 00:59:14,173
Here I go singing low

751
00:59:14,221 --> 00:59:19,694
Bye-bye, blackbird...

752
00:59:19,743 --> 00:59:22,415
Oh, cor blimey!
You're not singing again, are you, Mick?

753
00:59:22,462 --> 00:59:25,500
Listen, Bloated Tonsils,
just cos you're dead miserable,

754
00:59:25,543 --> 00:59:28,933
it doesn't mean the rest of us
have to look like 'Keep death off the road'.

755
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:31,337
Judy Garland. In bad health.

756
00:59:31,383 --> 00:59:32,975
Oh, me arse!

757
00:59:33,022 --> 00:59:35,935
I wanna be around

758
00:59:35,984 --> 00:59:38,452
To pick up the pieces

759
00:59:39,183 --> 00:59:42,493
When somebody breaks your heart.

760
00:59:42,544 --> 00:59:44,134
Go on, Ei, I love this.

761
00:59:44,183 --> 00:59:46,778
Somebody twice as smart

762
00:59:46,824 --> 00:59:49,702
As I

763
00:59:50,424 --> 00:59:53,019
I wanna be around

764
00:59:53,065 --> 00:59:56,057
To see how she does it

765
00:59:56,105 --> 01:00:00,417
When she pulls your heart to bits

766
01:00:00,464 --> 01:00:04,060
To see how that puzzle fits

767
01:00:04,105 --> 01:00:06,700
So fine

768
01:00:06,746 --> 01:00:11,297
And that's when I'll discover
that revenge is sweet

769
01:00:11,346 --> 01:00:16,545
When I'm sitting there, applauding,
from that front-row seat

770
01:00:16,586 --> 01:00:19,976
When somebody breaks your heart

771
01:00:20,026 --> 01:00:22,495
Like you

772
01:00:22,547 --> 01:00:27,540
Like you broke mine

773
01:00:27,587 --> 01:00:29,578
(All clap)
- Ah, great. Thanks, Ei.

774
01:00:31,827 --> 01:00:37,221
WIRELESS: ... 'ere now take that crisis what
cropped up between Ron and Eth last Friday

775
01:00:37,268 --> 01:00:40,543
And when I say 'crisis' Ted
I mean it was a real crisis,

776
01:00:40,587 --> 01:00:42,897
especially as far as Eth was concerned

777
01:00:42,947 --> 01:00:44,743
(Musical interlude)

778
01:00:50,947 --> 01:00:52,745
ETH: Oh, Ron.

779
01:00:52,788 --> 01:00:54,381
I don't know

780
01:00:54,428 --> 01:00:58,216
It seems to have got so much worse
these last few weeks

781
01:00:59,069 --> 01:01:03,267
Somehow I just can't seem to get you
out of my mind day or night.

782
01:01:03,308 --> 01:01:04,788
(Dave chomps)

783
01:01:04,828 --> 01:01:06,785
You've become a sort of ache

784
01:01:07,788 --> 01:01:10,179
Have you got to make that noise when you eat?

785
01:01:10,230 --> 01:01:11,822
What noise?

786
01:01:11,870 --> 01:01:13,382
Cor blimey!

787
01:01:13,429 --> 01:01:16,024
What a future I've got to look forward to.

788
01:01:16,069 --> 01:01:18,060
25 years with Mouth Almighty.

789
01:01:19,150 --> 01:01:23,507
ETH: ... you know it's ...
It's the romantic side with us

790
01:01:23,549 --> 01:01:25,542
It's the kissing and the ...

791
01:01:26,631 --> 01:01:28,223
You know ...

792
01:01:33,470 --> 01:01:35,621
MAN: I've switched the light off.

793
01:01:35,671 --> 01:01:39,185
I don't know whether I'm doing right or wrong.

794
01:01:39,231 --> 01:01:41,904
WIRELESS: ... how's your precious one?
(Laughter)

795
01:01:49,352 --> 01:01:51,343
Who the bleeding hell was that?

796
01:01:52,352 --> 01:01:53,831
Uncle Ted.

797
01:01:54,832 --> 01:01:56,424
Me dad's brother.

798
01:01:56,471 --> 01:01:58,350
God blimey.

799
01:01:58,393 --> 01:01:59,904
What a family I've married into.

800
01:01:59,952 --> 01:02:01,432
A crowd of nutters.

801
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:03,781
He frightened the bleeding life out of me.

802
01:02:03,833 --> 01:02:05,824
(Clock chimes on wireless)

803
01:02:10,953 --> 01:02:13,422
This is your storyteller, The Man in Black ...

804
01:02:14,794 --> 01:02:16,785
Teddy! Stop acting soft.

805
01:02:18,514 --> 01:02:19,629
Norah!

806
01:02:19,674 --> 01:02:21,266
Hey, Norah!

807
01:02:22,953 --> 01:02:24,944
All right, Moggie? How are you?

808
01:02:25,953 --> 01:02:31,951
Can I have two halves of shandy, a Matise,
a Double Diamond, a pale ale and lime,

809
01:02:31,995 --> 01:02:37,991
er, a Black & Tan, a pint of mix, a rum and pep,
a rum and blackcurrant, and a Guinness?

810
01:02:38,035 --> 01:02:41,027
- Oh, and have one for yourself, love.
- Thanks Tone

811
01:02:42,036 --> 01:02:44,185
Nervous, love?

812
01:02:44,236 --> 01:02:47,911
But everybody feels nervous
on their wedding day.

813
01:02:47,955 --> 01:02:50,868
GIRLS: When Johnny Dunn was 21

814
01:02:50,915 --> 01:02:54,625
He used to dine at each caf‘

815
01:02:54,676 --> 01:02:58,386
He loved the ladies, so they say

816
01:02:58,435 --> 01:03:02,145
That's why he dined at each caf‘

817
01:03:02,197 --> 01:03:04,392
His father's got, now, what has he got?

818
01:03:04,435 --> 01:03:06,029
An awful lot

819
01:03:06,077 --> 01:03:09,752
And that's not good for young Johnny

820
01:03:09,797 --> 01:03:12,674
When he said, 'Go to work, my son'

821
01:03:12,717 --> 01:03:16,870
What did he say?
Johnny said, 'I'm having too much fun'

822
01:03:16,917 --> 01:03:20,627
I love the ladies, I love the ladies

823
01:03:20,678 --> 01:03:24,352
I wanna be among the girls

824
01:03:24,397 --> 01:03:28,073
And when it's five o'clock and the tea is set

825
01:03:28,118 --> 01:03:31,793
I'm wanna have my tea with some brunette

826
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:35,308
I love the ladies, I love the ladies

827
01:03:35,359 --> 01:03:37,827
I love the tall ones, short ones

828
01:03:37,879 --> 01:03:39,596
Mm, God bless 'em

829
01:03:39,639 --> 01:03:45,636
The world can't turn around
without a beautiful girl

830
01:03:46,919 --> 01:03:49,035
RED: I’ll get 'em now I'll get 'em now

831
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:50,558
All right, Mam.

832
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,592
RED: Come on, Mick.

833
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:55,756
In just a minute. I'll finish me drink.

834
01:03:55,799 --> 01:03:58,872
WOMAN: Let me have your glasses please!
- Mick, come on.

835
01:03:58,919 --> 01:04:00,400
Ignore him.

836
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:02,317
Come on, Kemo Sabe!

837
01:04:02,361 --> 01:04:03,839
All right, Tonto!

838
01:04:03,881 --> 01:04:05,712
Oh, men! Don't they mither?

839
01:04:06,841 --> 01:04:11,471
EILEEN: Is he still handy around the house?
MICKY: Joking, aren't you? Won't do a tap.

840
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:14,638
He changed a nappy once.
Nearly had a nervous breakdown.

841
01:04:14,681 --> 01:04:18,197
- I'd better go, otherwise he'll get a cob on.
- You're not frightened of him?

842
01:04:18,241 --> 01:04:21,153
Am I shite! He looks at me the wrong way,
I give him a dog's life.

843
01:04:21,202 --> 01:04:23,716
Come on, now. Let's have your glasses please!

844
01:04:23,761 --> 01:04:27,118
We're on the road to anywhere

845
01:04:27,162 --> 01:04:31,154
With never a heartache and never a care

846
01:04:31,202 --> 01:04:35,196
We've got no home, we've got no friends

847
01:04:35,243 --> 01:04:38,758
We're grateful for everything
the good Lord sends

848
01:04:38,803 --> 01:04:42,352
We're on the road to anywhere...

849
01:04:42,403 --> 01:04:44,393
Eh! You're telling me.

850
01:04:44,442 --> 01:04:46,035
(All talk at once)

851
01:04:46,083 --> 01:04:49,712
If I was manager of that team,
I wouldn't change nothing, nothing.

852
01:04:49,764 --> 01:04:53,313
- He hasn't been for three week s.
- The man hasn't been for months.

853
01:04:53,364 --> 01:04:54,956
(Girls stop singing)

854
01:04:55,004 --> 01:04:57,038
There's room there for improvement.

855
01:04:57,084 --> 01:04:58,563
(All talk at once again)

856
01:04:58,604 --> 01:05:00,673
There's always room for improvement.

857
01:05:00,723 --> 01:05:02,920
Red? Red!

858
01:05:03,924 --> 01:05:06,564
See what I mean?
Doesn't take a blind bit of notice.

859
01:05:06,605 --> 01:05:08,402
It's like talking to a corpse.

860
01:05:08,444 --> 01:05:09,924
Eh, soft shite!

861
01:05:09,964 --> 01:05:11,955
You said you wanted to go, before.

862
01:05:13,045 --> 01:05:15,638
It's worse than the bleeding Gestapo, this is.

863
01:05:15,685 --> 01:05:18,883
- I can have a talk, can't I?
- Ooh, God help us, it's alive!

864
01:05:18,924 --> 01:05:20,518
- Men!
- The little dears!

865
01:05:22,286 --> 01:05:26,677
So don't be a stranger,
otherwise I'll not see you till next Preston Guild.

866
01:05:26,726 --> 01:05:30,241
We're only in Jubilee Drive.
You're only ten minutes away.

867
01:05:30,286 --> 01:05:31,764
We'll see.

868
01:05:31,806 --> 01:05:33,522
I'll try and come round.

869
01:05:33,566 --> 01:05:36,683
Or maybe I could come to yours.
You're living in Vane Street, aren't you?

870
01:05:36,727 --> 01:05:40,321
Oh, you'd better not, Micky.
He's funny about having visitors.

871
01:05:41,327 --> 01:05:42,725
OK.

872
01:05:42,767 --> 01:05:44,758
Then you try and come to me.

873
01:05:44,807 --> 01:05:46,399
We'll see, kid.

874
01:05:47,807 --> 01:05:49,080
Well...

875
01:05:49,127 --> 01:05:51,118
I'd better get Father Feck home.

876
01:05:53,127 --> 01:05:55,516
Come on, Trigger, back to the reservation.

877
01:05:55,567 --> 01:05:57,558
- See you Micky
- Ta-ra, lads.

878
01:06:00,447 --> 01:06:02,040
MAISIE: Come on, Ei.

879
01:06:02,087 --> 01:06:05,798
MAISIE: Barney Google!
The fellow with the googly eyes

880
01:06:05,848 --> 01:06:07,726
MEN: ... so will I

881
01:06:07,769 --> 01:06:11,205
Singing I will, if you will, so will I

882
01:06:11,249 --> 01:06:13,638
Singing I will, if you will

883
01:06:13,689 --> 01:06:15,680
I will, if you will...

884
01:06:17,089 --> 01:06:18,680
I have had a ball!

885
01:06:18,729 --> 01:06:21,038
Do you have to shout? You'll wake the dead.

886
01:06:21,089 --> 01:06:24,161
GRAN: Is that you, Eileen?
- Oh, God, blimey, you have!

887
01:06:24,210 --> 01:06:27,486
Yeah, it's only me and Dave, Gran.
We'll be in in a minute.

888
01:06:27,529 --> 01:06:30,442
- I want a wee.
- Oh, then do it over there and be quick.

889
01:06:39,851 --> 01:06:40,839
(Urinates)

890
01:06:40,891 --> 01:06:43,086
Up a lazy river

891
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:46,970
By the old mill run

892
01:06:47,011 --> 01:06:49,002
Oh, suffering Jesus!

893
01:06:49,051 --> 01:06:51,042
That's all we need, you singing.

894
01:06:51,091 --> 01:06:53,969
As if life isn't purgatory enough without that.

895
01:06:54,011 --> 01:06:56,605
That lazy, lazy river

896
01:06:56,652 --> 01:06:58,846
In the noon-day sun

897
01:07:00,971 --> 01:07:02,962
GRAN: Eileen! It's late

898
01:07:03,011 --> 01:07:05,572
OK, Gran, we won't be much longer.

899
01:07:05,612 --> 01:07:07,603
Come on, dead hake. Hurry up.

900
01:07:08,893 --> 01:07:10,485
And be quiet

901
01:07:11,813 --> 01:07:13,804
A lazy, lazy river

902
01:07:14,813 --> 01:07:16,804
In the noon-day sun

903
01:07:17,813 --> 01:07:20,279
GRAN: Eileen! Make sure that door's locked

904
01:07:20,333 --> 01:07:22,049
Wouldn't this put years on you?

905
01:07:22,093 --> 01:07:23,493
OK, Gran.

906
01:07:23,534 --> 01:07:26,173
I'm sure I was put on this earth
just to be tormented.

907
01:07:26,214 --> 01:07:27,613
Get in!

908
01:07:27,654 --> 01:07:29,962
Up a lazy river...

909
01:07:30,014 --> 01:07:31,606
And be careful.

910
01:07:37,894 --> 01:07:41,604
Love Is A Many-Splendored Thing

911
01:09:41,499 --> 01:09:43,092
How are you, love?

912
01:09:47,101 --> 01:09:49,615
I fell off the bleeding scaffolding, Maisie.

913
01:09:52,421 --> 01:09:54,219
Oh, George.

914
01:09:54,261 --> 01:09:55,741
George.

915
01:09:59,863 --> 01:10:01,854
HARMONICA: The Isle of Innisfree

916
01:10:59,787 --> 01:11:01,265
Oh, Tony.

917
01:11:04,107 --> 01:11:05,587
Oh, son!

918
01:11:15,627 --> 01:11:18,859
Well... Are you ready?

919
01:11:19,948 --> 01:11:20,937
Yeah.

920
01:11:20,988 --> 01:11:22,467
Fighting fit.

921
01:11:32,988 --> 01:11:35,264
They're dead fiddly, these, aren't they?

922
01:11:35,309 --> 01:11:36,299
Yeah.

923
01:11:38,309 --> 01:11:41,028
- Get the carnations from Annie Gaffney?
- Yeah.

924
01:11:43,029 --> 01:11:44,621
There you are.

925
01:11:49,270 --> 01:11:51,261
Well, let's be having you.

926
01:11:52,270 --> 01:11:53,862
Are we all ready?

927
01:11:58,109 --> 01:12:00,703
Well, sun bun, mustn't keep the bride waiting.

928
01:12:01,711 --> 01:12:03,904
No, cor blimey. I'd never live it down.

929
01:12:19,792 --> 01:12:21,384
(Car drives off)

930
01:12:23,591 --> 01:12:25,980
PRIEST: I, Thomas Anthony, take thee, Rose

931
01:12:26,032 --> 01:12:28,341
TONY: I, Thomas Anthony, take thee, Rose

932
01:12:28,391 --> 01:12:30,701
- To my wedded wife
- To my wedded wife

933
01:12:30,752 --> 01:12:33,185
- To have and to hold
- To have and to hold

934
01:12:33,232 --> 01:12:35,951
- From this day forward
- From this day forward

935
01:12:35,992 --> 01:12:38,587
- For better for worse
ROSE: For better for worse

936
01:12:38,632 --> 01:12:41,226
- For richer for poorer
- For richer for poorer

937
01:12:41,273 --> 01:12:44,025
- In sickness and in health.
- In sickness and in health.

938
01:12:44,073 --> 01:12:47,065
- Till death do us part.
- Till death do us part.

939
01:12:47,113 --> 01:12:51,425
- And thereto I plight thee my troth.
- And thereto I plight thee my troth.

940
01:12:52,875 --> 01:12:55,069
Ego conjungo vos in matrimonium.

941
01:12:56,073 --> 01:12:58,462
In nomine Patris et Filii

942
01:12:58,514 --> 01:13:00,710
et Spiritus Sancti.

943
01:13:03,113 --> 01:13:04,433
Amen.

944
01:13:04,474 --> 01:13:06,067
BOTH: Amen.

945
01:13:20,994 --> 01:13:25,546
MAM: For all you mean to me

946
01:13:25,595 --> 01:13:29,668
My thanks to you

947
01:13:30,595 --> 01:13:34,668
For every memory

948
01:13:35,555 --> 01:13:39,152
My thanks to you

949
01:13:39,877 --> 01:13:47,670
My thanks for everything we had to share

950
01:13:48,397 --> 01:13:56,192
For all the joy you brought
when you were there

951
01:13:56,917 --> 01:14:01,071
These foolish words of mine

952
01:14:01,799 --> 01:14:04,915
Can never say

953
01:14:06,118 --> 01:14:10,270
How slow the hand of time

954
01:14:11,359 --> 01:14:15,148
Now you've all gone away

955
01:14:15,958 --> 01:14:20,315
As years go rolling by

956
01:14:21,038 --> 01:14:24,427
My whole life through

957
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:28,598
I give my love

958
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:32,520
And all my thanks

959
01:14:33,239 --> 01:14:35,230
To you

960
01:14:37,119 --> 01:14:39,110
(Guests clap)

961
01:14:40,679 --> 01:14:43,672
MAN: I got into a boxi ng ring with a fella ...

962
01:14:43,721 --> 01:14:46,439
Dad, you're not going to sing
that old bleeding thing?

963
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:48,869
WOMAN: Come on.  Let's have some records

964
01:14:48,921 --> 01:14:51,913
EDDIE CALVERT: Oh Mein Papa

965
01:15:04,362 --> 01:15:06,876
MAISIE: Come on, Mam.
GEORGE: Come on, girl.

966
01:15:07,882 --> 01:15:10,555
DAVE: Good night, Nell.
MAM: Good night, Dave.

967
01:15:10,601 --> 01:15:12,594
EILEEN: See you tomorrow, Mam

968
01:15:12,643 --> 01:15:14,122
MAM: OK, Ei.

969
01:15:16,681 --> 01:15:19,072
BENJAMIN BRITTEN & PETER PEARS:
O Waly, Waly

970
01:15:22,122 --> 01:15:25,594
The water is wide

971
01:15:25,643 --> 01:15:29,113
I cannot get o'er

972
01:15:29,163 --> 01:15:36,319
And neither have I wings to fly

973
01:15:36,363 --> 01:15:40,515
Give me a boat

974
01:15:40,564 --> 01:15:43,955
That will carry two

975
01:15:44,765 --> 01:15:47,881
Then both shall row

976
01:15:47,925 --> 01:15:52,395
My love and I

977
01:15:55,925 --> 01:16:02,684
Oh, down in the meadows, the other day

978
01:16:02,726 --> 01:16:09,484
A-gathering flowers, both fine and gay

979
01:16:10,206 --> 01:16:17,683
A-gathering flowers, both red and blue

980
01:16:18,407 --> 01:16:21,399
I little thought

981
01:16:21,447 --> 01:16:26,442
What love can do

982
01:16:34,127 --> 01:16:41,604
I leaned my back up against some oak

983
01:16:42,127 --> 01:16:48,841
Thinking that it was a trusty tree

984
01:16:49,368 --> 01:16:57,049
But first it bended and then it broke

985
01:16:57,770 --> 01:17:06,087
And so did my false love to me

986
01:17:08,810 --> 01:17:15,806
A ship there is and she sails the sea

987
01:17:15,850 --> 01:17:23,121
She's loaded deep, as deep can be

988
01:17:23,171 --> 01:17:27,323
But not so deep

989
01:17:27,371 --> 01:17:31,728
As the love I'm in

990
01:17:32,251 --> 01:17:41,251
I know not if I sink or swim

991
01:17:48,734 --> 01:17:52,885
O, love is handsome

992
01:17:52,933 --> 01:17:56,641
And love is fine

993
01:17:56,692 --> 01:18:01,243
And love's a jewel

994
01:18:01,292 --> 01:18:05,002
While it is new

995
01:18:05,533 --> 01:18:10,323
But when it is old

996
01:18:10,373 --> 01:18:15,368
It groweth cold

997
01:18:16,014 --> 01:18:19,212
Then fades away

998
01:18:19,935 --> 01:18:27,614
Like morning dew
