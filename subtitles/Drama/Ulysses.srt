1
00:00:04,437 --> 00:00:10,842
The Hallucination of Ulysses

2
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:49,274
Come up here, Dedalus!
Come up, you fearful jesuit!

3
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:53,547
Dedalus?

4
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:20,508
Here is my dear brothers
the real Christ

5
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:24,113
body, soul,
the blood and guts.

6
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:29,217
Slow music, please
Silence all!

7
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:33,960
Tell me, Mulligan!

8
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,828
Yes, my dear!

9
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:36,853
How long is Haines
will this tower?

10
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:40,567
He thinks you
is not a gentleman.

11
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:42,159
Ah, that pesky English!

12
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:44,571
Bursting with money
and indigestion,

13
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:46,163
because it comes from Oxford.

14
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:48,669
You know, Dedalus?

15
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:50,677
He does not understand.

16
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:52,440
If he stays here,
go away!

17
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:55,579
Hey, lend me your handkerchief
so I wipe my razor.

18
00:01:57,817 --> 00:02:00,684
The bard's scarf!

19
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:04,722
The new color for the Irish poets

20
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:08,159
green snot.
Can you imagine the taste?

21
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:12,187
My aunt believes
you killed your mother.

22
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:18,966
He could have knelt down, when
his dying mother asked, Dedalus.

23
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:22,842
I imagine his mother,
pleading with his last breath,

24
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:25,003
so that you kneel
and prayed for her.

25
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:34,715
There is something sinister in you.

26
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:38,422
Even a Jesuit education
creates strange things.

27
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,561
Ah, poor doggy!

28
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:46,562
I'll give you some shirts
and some scarves.

29
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:48,635
How are going
breeches of the second hand?

30
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:51,502
Thanks, but I can not use them.
Are gray.

31
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:55,363
Ah, can not use them!
Etiquette is etiquette!

32
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:58,409
He kills his mother,
but can not use gray pants.

33
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,879
Look at you,
his dreadful bard!

34
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:07,919
What do you have against me?

35
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:10,352
SPIT!

36
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:14,394
Remember the first time
I went to your house,

37
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:16,262
after the death of my mother?
Her aunt asked who

38
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:18,196
was in her room.
- What I said?

39
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:21,398
"Ah, Dedalus,
whose mother died stupidly. "

40
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:25,928
I said that?

41
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:31,368
And what's wrong with that?
I think the death beast.

42
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,946
I see dead in droves,
every day being

43
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:37,951
processed in casings
in the dissecting room.

44
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:39,919
That's pretty beast
that's it.

45
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:43,323
You do not knelt
on his deathbed and yet

46
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:45,791
is upset with me.
What nonsense!

47
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:48,428
I said it, but declined
offend the memory of his mother.

48
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:50,396
I'm not thinking
on offense to my mother.

49
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:53,263
- What, then?
- On the offense to me.

50
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:02,473
- You're impossible!
- Are you there, Mulligan?

51
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:03,600
I'm coming!

52
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:09,749
Do not be sad about it all day.
Let the bad mood away.

53
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:12,185
Haines wants breakfast each morning.
He finds it very smart.

54
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:13,519
Tickle it with a
changed, okay?

55
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,787
I got paid,
this morning.

56
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:16,656
At school? It was enough?
Lend us a little,

57
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:18,351
let's take a nice drop.

58
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:40,580
In the name of the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit.

59
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,483
I'll tell you something, Mulligan,
you make a very strong tea.

60
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:46,386
As the old mother Grogan said,
when I make tea, I make  tea

61
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:48,921
when I make water,
I make water!

62
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:52,948
- My God, it is tea!
- "Is this what I do, Mrs Cahill,

63
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:57,090
she said. Attention: Mrs. Cahill,
God sent it, do not use the teapot. "

64
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:02,869
Put on your book
as an indication of Stephen,

65
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:04,504
This is folk art!

66
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:07,440
Seriously, Dedalus, I'm broken.
Just go to school

67
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,343
And bring me some
the money they owe me.

68
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:13,246
Today's poets
should drink and dream.

69
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:14,080
Yes ..

70
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,550
Today, Ireland expects
his men to do their duty.

71
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:20,417
I need to visit
your national library today.

72
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:22,448
But first,
let's get to our dive!

73
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:25,190
This is the day
their monthly bath, Dedalus?

74
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:29,395
The dirty poet undertakes
to wash once a month.

75
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:32,262
All Ireland is washed
by the Gulf Stream.

76
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:37,537
I intend to use your phrases such
in my book, if you please.

77
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:41,240
- Will I be paid for it?
- Well, that I can not say.

78
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,143
Oh, wait until you hear
his theory of Hamlet, Haines.

79
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:47,010
Come on, Dedalus!
Have you eaten all we left.

80
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:18,644
What is your theory about Hamlet?

81
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:21,545
No!
I am not qualified to do so!

82
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:25,582
You could not understand it
without drinking a little, right?

83
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:29,155
It's simple.
He proves mathematically

84
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:31,357
that Hamlet's grandson
is Shakespeare's grandfather,

85
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:35,828
and that he himself,
is the spirit of his father.

86
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:38,695
What?
Himself?

87
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:41,898
A little drink of anything,
can loosen the tongue of Dedalus.

88
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:49,275
I once read a theory about
such thing as a father and son

89
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:53,268
the child is struggling
to be rewarded by her father.

90
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:02,588
I think we should not laugh,
He is blaspheming.

91
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,924
- How did he call it?
- The ballad of joking Jesus.

92
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,492
Oh, you had heard?

93
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:08,483
About 3 times a day
after meals.

94
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:11,364
You're not a believer, is it?

95
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:14,267
I mean, a believer in the sense
strict word.

96
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,636
It seems to me that the word
has only one meaning.

97
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:20,732
Yes, of course.
Believe it or not, right?

98
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:27,637
Whoever stole the poor
Thus Spake give Mr. Zarathrusta!

99
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:38,315
Secretly, I do not believe
the idea of a personal God.

100
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:40,793
You also do not
believe, I imagine.

101
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,995
You're giving me a bad
example of free thought.

102
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:45,862
I dare say that you like
Irish, should think so.

103
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:49,735
In England, we know that
treat them unfairly,

104
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:52,071
and it seems to me that
we can blame history.

105
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:54,938
I'm English,
and I think as such.

106
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:58,241
I do not want my country
fall into the hands of a Jew.

107
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:00,674
I believe this
be a problem now.

108
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,847
Poldy?
Hurry this tea, I'm thirsty!

109
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:48,817
But it takes!

110
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:07,275
Who are the letters?

111
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,621
Can I open the curtains?

112
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:16,679
Is it good?

113
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:20,455
Who sent the letter?

114
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,466
Ah, the Boylan!
Him ..

115
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:34,770
he is bringing
The program for the concert this afternoon.

116
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:37,072
At 4 o'clock.

117
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:42,007
What to sing?

118
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:45,709
Ah, "La ci" give and
"Love's Old Sweet Song."

119
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:53,314
You. .. or
to open the window a little?

120
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:55,962
What time is the funeral
Paddy Dignam?

121
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:58,829
I think it's at 11.
I have not read the newspaper.

122
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:01,488
Give me ...

123
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:06,429
No!

124
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:12,943
No, the book!
He must have fallen!

125
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:18,807
I wanted to ask him
about a word.

126
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:25,756
Here. What does it mean?

127
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:28,260
Metempsychosis?

128
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,023
Yes, who or what is it?

129
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:34,655
Metempsychosis is Greek. The Greek.

130
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:39,361
Means ...
the transmigration of souls.

131
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,942
Ah, that great!
Speak my language!

132
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:47,038
"... The monster Maffei desisted,
and the victim walked away with a curse ... "

133
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:50,714
- Are you finished?
- Yes, and there's nothing obscene.

134
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,552
She is passionate
the first guy all the time?

135
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,587
I have not read.
You want another?

136
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:01,957
I want to.
Bring another of Paul de Kock's.

137
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:04,156
What a beautiful name it has!

138
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:08,331
Reincarnation,
that is the word!

139
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,936
Some people believe
we continue to life

140
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:14,269
in another body after death
and others who have lived before.

141
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:17,675
Some say they remember
of past lives.

142
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:31,088
It smells burned,
left something on fire?

143
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,651
The kidney!

144
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,691
Hockey!

145
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:55,247
Mr. Daesy asked me to
remove my doubts with you.

146
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:57,112
- You can not do alone?
- No, sir.

147
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,781
6, takes one.

148
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:14,299
Stupid and ignorant.
Still, someone loves you.

149
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,725
Put him in your arms
and his heart.

150
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:21,040
Moreover,
the rest of the world misses.

151
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,907
A leading zero.
Still, he is loved.

152
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:28,340
Although with its weakness,
with full force.

153
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:33,109
Understand now?
Can you get 2 of your own?

154
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:41,393
I was like him,
graceful and needy.

155
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:46,456
My childhood
was by my side.

156
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,594
They are very simple.

157
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:52,636
Yes, sir. Thanks.

158
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,466
Come on,
Mr. Deasy calls.

159
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:00,773
There you are.
Hockey!

160
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:04,581
Mr Dedalus,
let's settle the score.

161
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:20,798
I'm counting.

162
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:30,604
- 3 and 12.
- Thank you, sir.

163
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:33,436
Do not hold so
will lose!

164
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:36,773
- Buy one of these here.
- My would always be empty.

165
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:38,540
Why not save!

166
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,783
You know what's reason
of pride for the English?

167
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:48,694
Pay the bills alone.
Never borrowed a penny.

168
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:51,163
Can you feel it? Can?

169
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,256
- At the moment, no.
- I knew not.

170
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:56,602
But one day feel.
We are generous,

171
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:58,763
but we also have to be fair.

172
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:01,796
I fear these words,
that make us so unhappy.

173
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:04,476
You consider me
an old conservative?

174
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:08,414
I have rebel blood too.
We are sons of Irish kings!

175
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:09,847
Alas!

176
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:14,286
Mr Dedalus, you would do me
a favor with his literary friends?

177
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:16,455
I have here
a letter to the press,

178
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:20,152
It is a disease foot and mouth.
Take a look.

179
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:26,365
"I can invade your space
valuable, foot and mouth

180
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:29,266
- To get to the point ... "
- I measure not words, is not it?

181
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:33,572
Take the bull by the horns
in all directions

182
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:36,575
thank the hospitality
of your columns ...

183
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:40,112
I want it printed!
I am surrounded by difficulties,

184
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:44,817
intrigue of ...
You can write, Mr Dedalus,

185
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:49,021
England is in the hands of
Jews as we are here.

186
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:51,590
Jewish merchants
working for the destruction.

187
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:55,594
A merchant is the one
who buys cheap and sells dear,

188
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:58,530
- Jew or gentile, is not it?
- They sinned against the light!

189
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,397
- Who has not sinned?
- What do you mean?

190
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:04,295
History is a nightmare
which I am trying to awake.

191
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:09,575
The laws of the Creator
are not equal to ours.

192
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,478
The whole story has always had
the same direction

193
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:14,469
- The manifestation of God!
- That's God!

194
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:19,214
- What?
- A shout in the street!

195
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:24,288
I predict that you will not be
this job for long.

196
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,160
Well, if you can
publish it at once.

197
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,027
I know two editors slightly.
We'll talk tomorrow.

198
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:32,830
Have a nice day, sir.

199
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:45,874
Ah, Mr Dedalus?

200
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:52,184
I just wanted to talk about what they say
Ireland has the honor of being

201
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:57,289
the only country that does not chase
Jews. Did you know that? No.

202
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,158
- Why?
- Why, sir?

203
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:01,183
Because I never allowed in!

204
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,060
Never allow your input!

205
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,399
- Bloom Hello!
- What are the new ones?

206
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:10,302
Is the paper today?
I want to see if the French won

207
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:13,205
anything else.
Where's the book on the subject?

208
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:14,773
Do you have any ...

209
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:16,866
... No problem, I hope?
It means ...

210
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:20,910
Oh no!
Today is the funeral of Paddy Dignam.

211
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,670
Yeah, poor guy.
A pity!

212
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:24,984
Well, come on, what can we do?

213
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,679
The wife is doing well, I believe?

214
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,387
Ah, yes!
Very well, thank you.

215
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:30,821
She will sing in a big fair
in Ulster Hall, Belfast, 25 days.

216
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:32,480
Really?
Who will produce?

217
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:37,129
Ah ... is like a tour.
Formed a committee ...

218
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:40,466
... Boylan was, you know?
You know him!

219
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:44,163
Ah, Boylan will produce?
Well, it's good news.

220
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:49,174
- You can keep ...
- Oh, wait let me see, wait!

221
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,005
- You can throw away when finished.
- What?

222
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,741
Play when finished,
I would even play.

223
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:58,248
Thanks ... to have borrowed.

224
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:29,379
Ineluctable modality of the visible.
At least, if not more,

225
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:31,916
wandered through my eyes.

226
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:36,819
Symbols,
all I'm here for;

227
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:43,629
roe and kelp;
the approach of the tide;

228
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:45,392
rusted hull.

229
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,300
Close your eyes and see!

230
00:17:56,275 --> 00:18:00,177
I'm doing me good in the dark.
My sword is ash

231
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:01,540
beside me.

232
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,948
Strike it.
They beat!

233
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:07,613
The sound is solid!

234
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:13,217
Now open your eyes!
I will open, just a moment.

235
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:19,796
I'm going to eternity
on Sandymount shore?

236
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:24,937
And all vanished since?
And if I open and you are forever

237
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,804
in the dark?
Enough!

238
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,271
I see if you can!

239
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:40,275
There, all the time without you
and always will be.

240
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,951
World without end!

241
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,061
One of her sorority,
I screeched to life.

242
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:54,031
Creation from nothing.

243
00:18:55,334 --> 00:19:02,069
Wife and partner Adam Kadmon,
Heva, naked Eve.

244
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:04,799
She had no navel.

245
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:07,576
Amaze!

246
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:17,548
Belly without blemish, bulging,
defender of parchment stretched.

247
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:22,559
No! White corn,
Eastern and immortal,

248
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:25,627
eternal wandering of the eternal.

249
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:32,037
Womb of sin. In the dark
the womb of sin, I was also.

250
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:34,437
Created, not forged.

251
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:36,842
For them!

252
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,077
A man with my voice
and my eyes,

253
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:41,944
and a ghost
ashes with the breath.

254
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:45,381
They united and separated,
the will of the coupler.

255
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:49,045
I can not forget
the letter to the press.

256
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:53,447
And then? The Bar 12:30.

257
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:55,561
Moreover,
this is easy with this money,

258
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:57,085
as a good young imbecile.

259
00:19:57,429 --> 00:19:59,260
Yes
I must.

260
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:02,695
My hat Latino soldier.

261
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:05,802
God, we simply
we should dress the character.

262
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:09,074
Ah! Just say the natural way:

263
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:11,975
"When I was in Paris,
Boul Mich, I used to ...".

264
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:16,081
What a great luggage
brought back,

265
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:19,847
curiosity to a
blue French telegram:

266
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:26,058
"Mother dying
come home, Dad. "

267
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,925
Mulligan's aunt
thinks you killed your mother.

268
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:32,462
The room and cold
domed tower waits.

269
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,325
I will not sleep there
when night comes.

270
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:43,041
Mulligan rescued a man from
drowning and you fear a dog barking.

271
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,910
You would do what he did?

272
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,813
A boat would be near,
a lifesaver.

273
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:49,280
Would do or not?

274
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:51,640
Truth! Say!

275
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:57,520
I would like,
I try.

276
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:00,749
I am not a good swimmer.

277
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:05,261
Water, cold, softness.

278
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:13,805
Soft eyes, soft hand,
soft, tender.

279
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:20,776
I am lonely here.
Ah, touch me soon, now!

280
00:21:22,981 --> 00:21:25,848
What is that word
known to all men?

281
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:30,177
I'm quiet and lonely here.
Sad too.

282
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,157
Tap.
Touch me!

283
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:10,693
This is a great old custom.
Glad to know that is not dead.

284
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:26,044
So look through your friend,
Dedalus!

285
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:28,313
- Who?
- Your son and heir.

286
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:31,214
That Mulligan
boor was with him?

287
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:33,685
No!
He even went alone.

288
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:39,691
He is with the ratings down.
Mulligan is a damn criminal.

289
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:44,329
His name stinks all over Dublin.
But with God's help

290
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:47,632
and of His blessed Mother,
I still write a letter

291
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:50,869
any day,
for his mother, or aunt,

292
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:53,105
or whoever,
that will open your eyes.

293
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:56,041
I predict its downfall,
believe me!

294
00:22:56,041 --> 00:23:00,137
I will not allow his nephew
bastard ruin my son.

295
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:06,108
Numb by his son.
He's right, something to cling to.

296
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,883
If Rudy had lived.

297
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:27,539
Must have been that morning,
Raymond,

298
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:30,575
she was at the window watching
2 dogs doing it incessantly.

299
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:34,170
- The increasing desire it.
- Give us a touch, Poldy.

300
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:37,040
God, I'm dying for it.

301
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,978
How life begins.

302
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:41,051
And then it grows.

303
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:46,050
My son inside her.
I could have helped her in life.

304
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:47,719
I could.

305
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:52,964
- What is the problem?
- We stopped.

306
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:55,831
- Where are we?
- In the grand canal.

307
00:23:56,301 --> 00:23:59,204
- Oh, the weather is changing.
- You are unpredictable as

308
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:00,967
baby's bottom.

309
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:05,669
We went back to walking.

310
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:12,083
- How are you?
- He is not seeing.

311
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:13,414
Ah, yes it is!

312
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:18,015
- How are you?
- Who?

313
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:22,249
Blazes Boylan.
There he is, taking a breath.

314
00:24:54,659 --> 00:25:02,000
- Sad! A child!
- Poor thing. Better not to live.

315
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,403
Hmm .. but they say the worst
is the man who takes his own life.

316
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:11,142
Temporary insanity, of course!
We must have a charitable view.

317
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:14,079
They say that man
that does this is cowardly.

318
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:15,706
Well, we should not judge.

319
00:26:10,702 --> 00:26:14,973
I was disturbed to see him
talking about suicide before Bloom.

320
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:19,433
- What? Why?
- His father poisoned himself.

321
00:26:19,844 --> 00:26:24,683
My God! I learned
now. Poisoned herself?

322
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:28,119
Hey, who's the guy behind
us? He is familiar to me.

323
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:34,859
Bloom. Madame Molly Bloom was ...
is, I mean, the soprano.

324
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:36,595
- She is your wife.
- Ah, I knew it!

325
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:39,397
I danced with her for 15 or
17 years ago, and she was

326
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:40,864
a great partner.

327
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,455
There is a history,
that two drunks came here

328
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,423
a night of fog,
look for the grave of a friend.

329
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:08,893
They asked for Mulcahy
and were informed of the location of the grave.

330
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:11,796
After wandering through the smoke,
they found the tomb.

331
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:14,733
A drunk read the name
Terence Mulcahy, and the other

332
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:17,634
was looking at the statue
of our Saviour the widow built.

333
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:20,528
After looking at the
sacred figure said:

334
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:25,535
"It looks nothing like the man.
Not Mulcahy, whoever did this! "

335
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:20,329
Close the door!
Has a hurricane out there!

336
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:25,366
Oh, on the announcement of Keys.
He wants two calls at the top.

337
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,472
We can do it.
You have the design?

338
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:30,875
Well, I can pick up at the library.
He was in the newspaper Kilkenny.

339
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:34,045
We do, yes.
Ask Him to give us three months

340
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:36,981
to renew the contract.
- Well, I was going to go there.

341
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:39,084
So go!
The world is ahead of you!

342
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:40,711
Thank you, sir.

343
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:45,390
Who wants a guess
for the Gold Cup?

344
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,721
Sceptre is the horse!

345
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:49,059
Entrez, mes enfants!

346
00:28:56,601 --> 00:28:58,536
- Whose is it?
- From Mr Garrett Deasy.

347
00:28:58,536 --> 00:29:00,171
- Good morning, Stephen!
- Good morning!

348
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:03,742
- Disease of the foot and mouth.
- The letter is not mine.

349
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:06,609
- Mr. Garrett asked me ...
- Oh, I know.

350
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:07,045
I also know his wife,
more than the old Tatar God

351
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:10,148
I also know his wife,
more than the old Tatar God

352
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:14,244
already done. By Jesus, she had
disease foot and mouth, for sure!

353
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:19,022
I want to write me something.
Something provocative!

354
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,625
Disease of the foot and mouth
that sucks!

355
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:27,228
Involve everyone, Father, Son,
Holy Ghost and Jakes M'Carthy.

356
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:29,700
Let me keep.

357
00:29:30,568 --> 00:29:34,239
Gentlemen, may I suggest
that the house transfer services?

358
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:38,039
For that particular site?
My vote is the Mooney's!

359
00:29:46,417 --> 00:29:49,921
On this subject,
he will renew two months and not 3,

360
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:52,490
but he wants a pair
in the Telegraph as well.

361
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:54,559
Tell him
to kiss my ass!

362
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,795
- Tell all the letters.
- Well, if I can

363
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,731
design in the library,
I tell him what you got

364
00:29:59,731 --> 00:30:01,766
a free ad.
- Tell him he can

365
00:30:01,766 --> 00:30:05,224
kiss my ass real Irish
whenever you want!

366
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:32,630
- Hello, Leopold!
- Chelsea Breen, how are you?

367
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:35,800
I can not complain.
How are you going to Molly?

368
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,369
Alright!
And your lord and master?

369
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:41,272
Oh, I do not even speak!
He is a danger to rattlesnakes!

370
00:30:41,272 --> 00:30:43,174
- You know what I did last night?
- What?

371
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:46,377
It woke me in the middle of the night,
saying that the ace of spades

372
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:49,244
was climbing the stairs.
- The ace of spades?

373
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:51,649
Ah ... um ... Mina Purefoy
already had the baby?

374
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:54,052
I just call
ask how you're going.

375
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:56,287
She is on maternity
Holles Street.

376
00:30:56,287 --> 00:30:59,154
- For three days she is ill.
- Sorry about that!

377
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:02,491
It's a complicated delivery,
second nurse.

378
00:31:02,827 --> 00:31:05,763
- Poor thing!
- Ah, there he is!

379
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:08,700
I brought your lunch.
Give my regards to Molly, right?

380
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,826
I will give.

381
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:19,368
Good morning, again!

382
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:30,748
The Jewish thoughtful.
He saw her eyes?

383
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:35,981
Ah, Dedalus, are in danger!
Get your shield!

384
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:04,943
Father?

385
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:12,321
Stand up straight,
for the love of the Lord Jesus!

386
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:15,315
- You got any money?
- Where do I get the money?

387
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,595
Nobody in Dublin
lend me a dime.

388
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:18,994
You got something.

389
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:23,794
Here you are.
See what you can do with it.

390
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:27,171
I bet you got five.
Give me more than that!

391
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:30,074
My,
you are like others, is not it?

392
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:32,977
A group of cheeky unhappy
since your poor mother died.

393
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:34,672
Can not seek money
elsewhere?

394
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:38,850
I can.
I looked across the gully

395
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,719
O'Connell Street.
I'll try this now.

396
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:47,025
- You're funny.
- Here, buy a bottle of milk,

397
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:50,483
bread or something.
Soon I go home.

398
00:33:57,068 --> 00:33:59,971
- There he is.
- What is he buying?

399
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:02,507
Leopoldo or
The Bloom Is on the Rye.

400
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:07,779
- He is crazy about books!
- He is an educated man.

401
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:13,513
He is not a common and ordinary person.
There's something artistic in Bloom.

402
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:16,085
Have you seen this book?

403
00:34:16,754 --> 00:34:19,621
Oh no.
She would not like that.

404
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:28,132
"All dollars
that her husband had given her,

405
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:31,035
were spent in the most expensive and
wonderful dress shops.

406
00:34:31,035 --> 00:34:33,938
For him! For Raoul!
His mouth is stuck in his

407
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:38,810
a voluptuous and delicious kiss
while his hands might feel

408
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:42,146
its opulent curves under
clothing. Is delayed

409
00:34:42,146 --> 00:34:45,638
he said hoarsely,
looking at her suspiciously.

410
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:51,589
The beautiful woman withdrew its wrapper,
displaying their shoulders Queen

411
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:57,662
and volume in the breasts. "
Oh, no ... 'll take this.

412
00:34:57,662 --> 00:35:00,565
Ah, Sweets of Sin!
This is very good!

413
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:03,432
- Here it is!
- Thanks!

414
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:14,612
Oh, look there!
"The time is closing!" Says one.

415
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:15,840
"Good luck!"

416
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:18,742
It should be exciting up there!

417
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:27,391
- Stephen?
- What are you doing here?

418
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:30,724
I bought it in another cart for a penny.
Is it good?

419
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:37,001
Chardenal's French primer.
Why did you buy it?

420
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:41,734
To learn French?
Take it! Is reasonable.

421
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:45,176
Father not Mind
bet on you.

422
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:47,378
I imagine that all
my books are gone.

423
00:35:47,378 --> 00:35:50,279
Some.
We had no choice.

424
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:16,266
Give us a touch, Poldy!
"God, I'm dying for it!"

425
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:20,910
I was happier before.
He was 28 years.

426
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:26,675
She was 23. Something
changed after Rudy.

427
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:32,918
I never liked that.
We can not turn back time.

428
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:08,853
How's the old heart,
citizen?

429
00:38:08,853 --> 00:38:11,956
Better than ever!
What is it, Garry?

430
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,014
We're going to win?

431
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:18,663
Let's see if we win
such Gold Cup.

432
00:38:18,663 --> 00:38:20,731
I think not yet.
Not until the fourth.

433
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:23,598
- When you stop jogging.
- Me too. Unlikely.

434
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:26,437
How's Willy Murray lately?

435
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:28,405
Let's drink to our friend,
Dignam!

436
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,308
Paddy Dignam? Dead?

437
00:38:36,013 --> 00:38:38,582
- What time is it?
- 4 hours.

438
00:38:38,582 --> 00:38:40,049
I'm late!

439
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:43,888
Listen, but I saw the 5
minutes ago.

440
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:46,524
He is not
more dead than you!

441
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:49,391
Maybe. They managed
bury it in the morning somehow.

442
00:38:50,227 --> 00:38:54,465
My God! Dignam!
I could swear ...

443
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:59,232
- That God is good?
- I'll forgive him for that!

444
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:03,637
Good God
it takes the poor Dignam?

445
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:07,704
Well, he is without
their problems now.

446
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:12,383
I say he is a villain
bloody, taking the lives

447
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:15,113
the poor Willy Dignam!
- Paddy Dignam!

448
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:19,557
- Be quiet!
- Good morning, gentlemen!

449
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:22,390
- Martin Cunningham passed through here?
- No, want to drink with us and wait?

450
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:26,263
Oh no sorry ...
no thanks, can not drink any more.

451
00:39:26,263 --> 00:39:30,165
- But I'll take one of these cigars!
- Pass it to one of those, please!

452
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:32,800
Ah, thank you!

453
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:36,474
- Are you afraid that he bite?
- No. Bloom is afraid that he

454
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:38,704
think your leg is a pole.

455
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:42,113
- Are you sure you want nothing?
- Ah, no thanks.

456
00:39:42,113 --> 00:39:45,015
Actually, I just need to talk
with Martin Cunningham on

457
00:39:45,015 --> 00:39:47,918
insurance of poor Dignam.
He asked me to

458
00:39:47,918 --> 00:39:50,321
to their home.
- Are you going there?

459
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:55,626
- Yes.
- You say to Ms. Dignam,

460
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:58,396
I'm sorry for the loss
and the funeral. Also,

461
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:03,267
everyone who knew him are
sad, having never known

462
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:09,604
someone as good and true
Willy and the poor deceased,

463
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:14,068
and tell her ...
- Yes, of course! With pleasure!

464
00:40:17,848 --> 00:40:22,182
I heard that Boylan is
producing a concert now, in the north!

465
00:40:24,321 --> 00:40:28,259
- Is not she?
- Who? Ah, yes.

466
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:32,196
It's true.
A summer tour, you know?

467
00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:33,798
- As an event.

468
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:36,699
Mrs. Bloom is the star
principal, is not it?

469
00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:42,100
My wife will sing, yes.
I believe it will be a success.

470
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,874
He is great at organizing,
excellent!

471
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:04,754
Lenehan, you look like someone
who lost a bob and found a tanner.

472
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:08,399
The race of the Gold Cup.
Throwaway won.

473
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:11,302
A stinky outside,
20-1.

474
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:12,963
And the rest nowhere.

475
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:15,405
Nice win!

476
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,066
20-1!

477
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:22,279
Such is life in a cottage.
Throwaway!

478
00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:24,645
Weakness,
His name is Sceptre.

479
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:28,185
Persecution!
The story is full of it!

480
00:41:28,185 --> 00:41:32,884
- Perpetuating hatred among nations.
- You know what is a nation?

481
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:34,819
- Yes.
- What is it?

482
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:39,396
A nation?
Nation is a group of people equal,

483
00:41:39,396 --> 00:41:42,333
living in the same place.
- If so I'm a nation

484
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:45,234
they live in the same
place for 5 years.

485
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:48,405
Or again,
living in different places.

486
00:41:48,405 --> 00:41:50,140
- This is my case!
- What is your nation,

487
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:53,007
if I may ask?
- Ireland!

488
00:41:53,711 --> 00:41:55,645
I was born here.
Ireland!

489
00:42:00,217 --> 00:42:03,880
Pass us the drinks.
What is that one?

490
00:42:04,955 --> 00:42:07,822
This is my, how the heck
said the policeman dead.

491
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:12,092
And I belong to a race
which is also hated and persecuted.

492
00:42:12,596 --> 00:42:17,668
Right now, this instant,
sold at auction in Morocco

493
00:42:17,668 --> 00:42:19,829
as slaves.

494
00:42:20,804 --> 00:42:23,340
You're talking
The New Jerusalem?

495
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:26,243
- I'm talking about injustice!
- Okay, raise your flag

496
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:27,574
and fight like men.

497
00:42:28,078 --> 00:42:29,480
This is not good.

498
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,947
Strength, hate!

499
00:42:31,782 --> 00:42:36,151
This is not life for men
and women! Insults and harassment.

500
00:42:36,854 --> 00:42:39,423
Everyone knows
to be the opposite.

501
00:42:39,423 --> 00:42:41,448
- What is life?
- What?

502
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:43,559
I mean,
the opposite of hatred.

503
00:42:45,529 --> 00:42:47,588
Well,
I go to court

504
00:42:48,098 --> 00:42:51,534
Martin Cunningham to get here
say that I come back in one minute.

505
00:42:53,771 --> 00:42:56,874
A new apostle to the Gentiles.
Universal love.

506
00:42:56,874 --> 00:42:59,209
Well, that's not what we learned?
To love our neighbors?

507
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:02,042
That guy?
Crave neighbors is their motto.

508
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:05,549
- Love an ...
- Well, Joe, to his good health and song.

509
00:43:05,549 --> 00:43:07,651
- More power, citizen!
- That's right!

510
00:43:07,651 --> 00:43:09,585
The blessing of God,
Mary and Patrick on you.

511
00:43:10,988 --> 00:43:12,957
- I know where he went.
- Who?

512
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:18,162
Bloom! In court, it's a lie!
He bet on Throwaway

513
00:43:18,162 --> 00:43:21,065
and went to get some money!
Bantam Lyons said Bloom

514
00:43:21,065 --> 00:43:25,569
made his bet this morning.
He is the only man in Dublin

515
00:43:25,569 --> 00:43:26,971
who won.
A black horse.

516
00:43:26,971 --> 00:43:29,166
He himself is a black horse.

517
00:43:29,707 --> 00:43:34,645
- Hello Joe, where is Bloom?
- Defrauding widows and orphans.

518
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:38,816
The new messiah of Ireland
island of saints and sages.

519
00:43:38,816 --> 00:43:41,719
Well,
they are still waiting for their redeemer.

520
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:44,622
- And so do we!
- Yes, and every man is born

521
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:47,558
they believe might be the Messiah.
And all Jews are

522
00:43:47,558 --> 00:43:51,428
extremely enthusiastic
to discover whether they are the mother or father.

523
00:43:51,428 --> 00:43:53,530
Oh my God,
needed to know Bloom

524
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:58,002
deceased before his son was born.
I found it one day at a market,

525
00:43:58,002 --> 00:44:00,904
buying kilos of food
for baby, six weeks before

526
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:03,340
of women giving birth.
- You call this man?

527
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:07,208
- I wonder if he got over it.
- Well, his son was born, is not it?

528
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:10,838
- And who he suspects?
- Ah, love with the neighbor ...

529
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:13,417
There you are!
Just got off the court.

530
00:44:13,417 --> 00:44:14,748
- I was looking for you.
- We are ready now.

531
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,054
Ah, can rely on.
You will see it is

532
00:44:17,054 --> 00:44:19,790
who owes money to him!
- Enough is enough!

533
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:22,359
Think he does not know,
scared the hell?

534
00:44:22,359 --> 00:44:24,395
I got a Jew for you
it was you who started it!

535
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:28,354
- All are mouse droppings!
- What?

536
00:44:29,433 --> 00:44:31,458
Do not tell anyone,
is secret!

537
00:44:32,436 --> 00:44:34,927
- Let's Get Away
- Leave me alone!

538
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:41,311
Three cheers for Israel!
Mendelssohn was a Jew and Karl Marx,

539
00:44:41,311 --> 00:44:44,214
Mercadante and Spinoza.
The Savior was a Jew,

540
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:45,806
and also his Father.
Your God!

541
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:48,514
He had no father!
Now comes, go soon!

542
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:51,288
- God to whom?
- Well, his uncle was a Jew,

543
00:44:51,288 --> 00:44:54,191
his God was a Jew and
Christ was a Jew like me!

544
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:57,092
Garry behind them!

545
00:45:25,622 --> 00:45:28,523
Look at that child!
Join things.

546
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:47,702
We came to see the fireworks, Gerty!

547
00:47:32,916 --> 00:47:36,408
Leopold! What brings you here?
Hopefully not a problem!

548
00:47:37,554 --> 00:47:41,859
No! I met with Mrs. Breen
and she told me about Mina Purefoy.

549
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:43,760
It is still in labor?
Was born?

550
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,663
Almost, almost!
Giving birth to a woman

551
00:47:46,663 --> 00:47:48,732
is not easy, you know?
- I bet not!

552
00:47:48,732 --> 00:47:51,068
- Mr Bloom, how are you?
- Oh, how are you doc?

553
00:47:51,068 --> 00:47:53,971
I'm fine, thanks.
Can I expect to see here?

554
00:47:53,971 --> 00:47:56,838
Let's see, doctor,
she's almost there, very close!

555
00:47:57,307 --> 00:47:59,209
Do not want to disturb you,
Nurse ...

556
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:02,112
- Do not bother, Leopold!
- You can wait in the waiting room,

557
00:48:02,112 --> 00:48:03,773
here are drinking a little.

558
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:23,597
Mrs Purefoy!

559
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:29,671
Please, gentlemen, speak low!
This is a house of healing!

560
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:37,308
Silence all!
Shut up big!

561
00:48:38,782 --> 00:48:39,612
Maestro?

562
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:53,664
<i> Life presents a difficult image, </ i>
<i> with misery and despair. </ i>

563
00:48:53,664 --> 00:49:00,194
<i> The father has a gun abominable, </ i>
<i> the mother has a lazy womb. </ i>

564
00:49:01,338 --> 00:49:10,247
<i> Casper's cousin was caught, </ i>
<i> for a homosexual crime. </ i>

565
00:49:10,247 --> 00:49:17,176
<i> my sister miscarried, </ i>
<i> the 42 th time. </ i>

566
00:49:19,056 --> 00:49:27,230
<i> Uncle Charlie was neutered, </ i>
<i> and he rarely cares. </ i>

567
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:36,605
<i> It was only their duty, </ i>
<i> cleaning the back of Grandpa's </ i>

568
00:49:42,412 --> 00:49:45,279
Silence!
Silence all!

569
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:50,887
Our beloved poet will recite,
for your particular entertainment.

570
00:49:50,887 --> 00:49:52,684
Get up, son!

571
00:50:20,317 --> 00:50:23,218
- My God in Heaven!
- Take care, Stephen!

572
00:50:23,954 --> 00:50:28,482
It's noble father in person,
beating on the roof.

573
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:33,325
Gentlemen, gentlemen!

574
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:42,773
- What about him?
- The Jesuits startled.

575
00:50:42,773 --> 00:50:45,675
They came with dire visions
about hell.

576
00:50:45,675 --> 00:50:50,047
He will never recover!
That is their tragedy.

577
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:51,537
What is yours?

578
00:50:52,482 --> 00:50:54,551
- What is that?
- Oh, I need more drink.

579
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:56,753
Pass me that bottle,
please!

580
00:50:56,753 --> 00:50:58,311
You've done it all night?

581
00:51:01,591 --> 00:51:04,458
What?
Come on, Dedalus, Haines wants to leave.

582
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:06,453
He's not well!

583
00:51:06,963 --> 00:51:09,533
Nonsense!
The poet only need to sleep.

584
00:51:09,533 --> 00:51:13,936
Gotta go home
before sunset!

585
00:51:14,438 --> 00:51:16,372
Sure, Dedalus,
Give us the keys now!

586
00:53:13,156 --> 00:53:16,023
Come here and I'll tell you.
I have a hymen inside.

587
00:53:23,166 --> 00:53:27,466
Medical students of the Trinity.
Idiots with no money!

588
00:53:30,507 --> 00:53:34,807
10 shillings for a virgin.
Pure, was never touched!

589
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:40,517
Something on your mind?
With all my worldly goods

590
00:53:40,517 --> 00:53:41,785
Something on your mind?
With all my worldly goods

591
00:53:41,785 --> 00:53:46,690
worldly in you.
You did it!

592
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:50,927
- I hate you!
- Me? When? Are you dreaming?

593
00:53:50,927 --> 00:53:53,122
When he saw all my
Secrets in the drawer.

594
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:57,926
Oh, you bastard married man,
I love him for doing that to me!

595
00:53:58,935 --> 00:54:01,836
Leopold! You here,
in the darkness of sin?

596
00:54:02,305 --> 00:54:04,441
Shh! Do not talk so loud!
Do not leave me!

597
00:54:04,441 --> 00:54:07,210
Well, this is an interesting block.
Rescue of fallen women,

598
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:09,546
Magdalene Asylum,
I am the secretary.

599
00:54:09,546 --> 00:54:13,846
Look, do not tell me lies
or to tell Molly!

600
00:54:14,451 --> 00:54:18,182
Would you like me to embrace,
for a split second?

601
00:54:18,888 --> 00:54:21,391
Ah, you rascal!
I needed to see!

602
00:54:21,391 --> 00:54:24,761
In old times' sake!
I just want a little fun,

603
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:29,599
a pepper in our marriages.
Know I always had a

604
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:33,603
crush on you?
- Ah, yes! You even seem a saint!

605
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:38,336
Josie Powell
was the most beautiful debutante in Dublin.

606
00:54:38,808 --> 00:54:40,610
Remember the party
Christmas Eve?

607
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:45,809
You were the lion of the night,
with their heroic recitations.

608
00:54:46,216 --> 00:54:50,880
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I give you Ireland, home and beauty.

609
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:57,324
The beloved dead day
beyond recall.

610
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:07,304
The old song of love!
We sit together on the staircase

611
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:11,104
under the mistletoe.
- I took the splinter from your hand.

612
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:18,679
You were hot.
Hot!

613
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:21,718
But you married Breen,
never forgive her for that!

614
00:55:21,718 --> 00:55:25,484
All that meant to me,
woman is killing me!

615
00:55:26,356 --> 00:55:28,958
Why not kissed me on the spot
where everything would be okay?

616
00:55:28,958 --> 00:55:31,119
You wish!

617
00:55:31,961 --> 00:55:35,897
Molly's best friend!
How can?

618
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:49,839
You go ahead, buddy?

619
00:55:52,415 --> 00:55:54,713
Hey, how's your
middle leg?

620
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:59,151
Come over here I
cake for you!

621
00:56:05,962 --> 00:56:08,829
Caught in the act!
We do not cause inconvenience.

622
00:56:08,932 --> 00:56:12,969
- Come on, name and address?
- Yes, of course!

623
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:17,565
Dr. Bloom, a dentist.
You have heard of Blum Pasha?

624
00:56:18,241 --> 00:56:21,177
Owns half of Austria,
Egypt. It's my cousin.

625
00:56:21,177 --> 00:56:24,114
- Proof.
- Allow me.

626
00:56:24,114 --> 00:56:25,648
My club is
Junior Army and Navy ...

627
00:56:25,648 --> 00:56:30,086
- Profession or business?
- Well, I follow a literary occupation,

628
00:56:30,086 --> 00:56:33,056
Author journalism.
I have connections with the presses

629
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:35,392
English and Irish.
They can call and confirm.

630
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:38,294
Hello?
Irish Urinal and Weekly Arsewipe talking!

631
00:56:38,294 --> 00:56:41,161
Who? How? Bloom?
Never heard!

632
00:56:41,698 --> 00:56:45,535
The people against Bloom.
Call the woman. Driscoll!

633
00:56:45,535 --> 00:56:48,402
Mary Driscoll, maid!

634
00:56:49,639 --> 00:56:52,542
You are part of the class
unfortunate?

635
00:56:52,542 --> 00:56:56,212
I'm not bad!
I carry a respectable moral

636
00:56:56,212 --> 00:56:59,079
and had to leave his job
to preserve my people!

637
00:57:00,049 --> 00:57:01,985
Than the accused?

638
00:57:01,985 --> 00:57:05,921
He gave some suggestions,
but I prefer to remain poor as I am!

639
00:57:06,623 --> 00:57:10,894
I was right!
I gave her souvenirs, emerald alloys

640
00:57:10,894 --> 00:57:14,030
well above their position.
I defended unconditionally

641
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:17,600
when she was accused of theft.
Now tell the truth!

642
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:22,105
God is my witness
I never touched anything!

643
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:26,041
The offense continued?
Something happened?

644
00:57:26,376 --> 00:57:29,279
He surprised me in the middle of
facilities, Sir, when

645
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:32,182
the lady was out doing
shop the morning of a request

646
00:57:32,182 --> 00:57:35,118
the safety pin.
He held me and abused me

647
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:38,019
in four places as a result.

648
00:57:39,389 --> 00:57:41,991
And also shifted
in my clothes!

649
00:57:41,991 --> 00:57:44,894
- She agreed!
- I wanted to confront him,

650
00:57:44,894 --> 00:57:49,092
by God and it strengthened
"Be quiet!"

651
00:57:51,534 --> 00:57:54,230
Order in court!

652
00:57:55,071 --> 00:57:57,938
The accused now
make a false statement.

653
00:57:59,709 --> 00:58:02,234
Innocent!

654
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:09,285
This is no place for levity
indecent rather than a deadly

655
00:58:09,285 --> 00:58:12,222
sinner disguised by drinks
beverages. I lay here,

656
00:58:12,222 --> 00:58:16,192
that there were no intimacies
and offenses against virtue,

657
00:58:16,192 --> 00:58:19,863
claimed by Driscoll, were
declared, but did not occur!

658
00:58:19,863 --> 00:58:24,334
There were cases of sleepwalking
the family of my client

659
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:26,063
but he wants to improve!

660
00:58:26,436 --> 00:58:31,074
He now faces a difficult phase
mortgage due to his extensive

661
00:58:31,074 --> 00:58:33,977
property in faraway Asia Minor.

662
00:58:33,977 --> 00:58:36,878
See slides
which will be shown.

663
00:58:41,484 --> 00:58:42,314
Oh, damn!

664
00:58:49,626 --> 00:58:53,357
The girl was treated by the defendant,
like her own daughter.

665
00:58:56,432 --> 00:59:00,336
I must bring evidence to certify
that hide the truth again,

666
00:59:00,336 --> 00:59:05,330
playing the old game,
when in error,

667
00:59:06,242 --> 00:59:08,176
persecute Bloom.

668
00:59:11,681 --> 00:59:14,548
I suggest
you do the right thing.

669
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:25,695
- A coin in his pocket.
- Arrest him, officer!

670
00:59:25,695 --> 00:59:28,631
He sent me an anonymous letter.
I still have it.

671
00:59:28,631 --> 00:59:30,967
He said he had seen
My unique globes

672
00:59:30,967 --> 00:59:34,437
when I sat in a box
Royal Opera House, and says that

673
00:59:34,437 --> 00:59:37,340
the deeply burned.
He offered to send me

674
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:40,343
by mail, a work of fiction
Monsieur Paul de Kock,

675
00:59:40,343 --> 00:59:44,447
called Sweets of Sin.
- Oh, me too!

676
00:59:44,447 --> 00:59:48,217
Yes
even one person is wrong!

677
00:59:48,217 --> 00:59:53,623
He sent me several letters
Handwritten, with exaggerated praise

678
00:59:53,623 --> 00:59:56,559
as "the Venus of kid."
He praised my batty

679
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:59,462
lower extremities, my
swollen calf in silk stockings

680
00:59:59,462 --> 01:00:02,365
positioned on the edge,
and praised my terribly

681
01:00:02,365 --> 01:00:06,402
hidden treasures
invaluable income, which,

682
01:00:06,402 --> 01:00:09,672
he said, could conjure.
He urged me to pollute the bed

683
01:00:09,672 --> 01:00:14,277
marriage, adultery,
at the earliest opportunity.

684
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:17,680
Me too!
This plebeian Don Juan observed me

685
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:21,884
pro behind a car
and sent me obscene pictures,

686
01:00:21,884 --> 01:00:24,821
as those sold
nights in Paris.

687
01:00:24,821 --> 01:00:28,658
An insult to any lady!
They showed a naked lady,

688
01:00:28,658 --> 01:00:32,795
fragile and lovely, his wife,
as he solemnly told me,

689
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:36,532
taken by him of course,
practicing illicit relations with a

690
01:00:36,532 --> 01:00:39,435
muscular torero,
obviously a scoundrel!

691
01:00:39,435 --> 01:00:43,006
And he urged me to do the same,
me behaving badly,

692
01:00:43,006 --> 01:00:47,243
sinning with soldiers of the troops.
He implored me to soil his letter

693
01:00:47,243 --> 01:00:50,144
in a way that I dare not say,
to punish him,

694
01:00:50,213 --> 01:00:53,916
as it truly deserves,
to ride it and ride it,

695
01:00:53,916 --> 01:00:57,215
and give it a lash perverse!
- Me too!

696
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:02,258
I will, by God above me,
flagellar this stray dog,

697
01:01:02,258 --> 01:01:05,125
while I can.
- Here? Again! I love danger!

698
01:01:05,762 --> 01:01:07,930
Burn your ass
to get started!

699
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:10,933
Draw stars and stripes on it!
Has no forgiveness for him,

700
01:01:10,933 --> 01:01:13,202
is a married man!
- All those people,

701
01:01:13,202 --> 01:01:17,306
I just wanted to give a new idea,
a warm without burning effusion,

702
01:01:17,306 --> 01:01:20,209
a gentle dusting
to stimulate circulation.

703
01:01:20,209 --> 01:01:23,804
Well, by God, you will have a
big surprise now, believe me!

704
01:01:24,147 --> 01:01:27,014
You've awakened the sleeping tiger
within me, to the fury!

705
01:01:27,383 --> 01:01:29,686
Make him suffer, Hanna dear.
Add pepper to it.

706
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:32,055
Reduce your pooch
the minimum of his life.

707
01:01:32,055 --> 01:01:34,557
Cat of nine tails,
castrate him, vivisseque it!

708
01:01:34,557 --> 01:01:37,493
Ah, I got chills!
It was your ambrosial beauty.

709
01:01:37,493 --> 01:01:41,486
Forget, forgive!
Fate, absolve me this time!

710
01:01:41,597 --> 01:01:44,464
Do not, Mrs. Talboys!
He should be beaten!

711
01:01:44,567 --> 01:01:48,604
- I will not.
- He is and always was a pig!

712
01:01:48,604 --> 01:01:52,608
Dare to bespeak me!
I will punish him in every way

713
01:01:52,608 --> 01:01:55,577
on public streets.
He is a known traitor!

714
01:01:56,079 --> 01:02:00,778
Lay down your pants without losing
time. Come here, sir! Quick!

715
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:04,754
Message of the Sacred Heart: New
addresses of all traitors to Dublin!

716
01:02:04,754 --> 01:02:07,123
- Sailor, he has organized.
- Really?

717
01:02:07,123 --> 01:02:10,493
That's what I heard!
20 women were thrown into the Gulf.

718
01:02:10,493 --> 01:02:14,953
At least the crime of Bloom
was lighter! Many think so.

719
01:02:16,432 --> 01:02:19,335
Whereas Leopold Bloom,
domiciled in Eccles Street, 7

720
01:02:19,335 --> 01:02:22,238
known as a forger, bigamist,
pimp, scoundrel, a traitor and

721
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:27,143
public nuisance for citizens
Dublin. I'll put an end

722
01:02:27,143 --> 01:02:31,671
that white slave trade
Dublin and deliver this hideous plague!

723
01:02:32,014 --> 01:02:33,072
Scandalous!

724
01:02:35,651 --> 01:02:40,418
He will take the place where
and imprisoned in Mountjoy prison.

725
01:02:40,857 --> 01:02:45,453
There, he will be hanged by the
neck until dead, and then

726
01:02:45,995 --> 01:02:50,261
if not fail the mission,
God have mercy on his soul.

727
01:02:51,033 --> 01:02:53,900
Who Hang Judas Iscariot?

728
01:02:55,838 --> 01:02:57,601
- Me?
- Yeah, you!

729
01:02:58,975 --> 01:03:01,842
He's inside with his friend,
Mr. Cohen.

730
01:03:02,311 --> 01:03:06,338
You can go ahead and pay more.
You are the father?

731
01:03:06,716 --> 01:03:09,617
- No.
- They are both black.

732
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:14,848
The mouse is tickled with this
night? How are the balls?

733
01:03:15,057 --> 01:03:19,050
Off.
Curiously they are right.

734
01:03:20,296 --> 01:03:22,398
Tilted to this side,
I think.

735
01:03:22,398 --> 01:03:24,298
One chance in 1 million,
My tailor says.

736
01:03:35,411 --> 01:03:38,073
I think the good seed,
by his accent.

737
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:41,217
- Are you in Dublin?
- I'm not really!

738
01:03:41,217 --> 01:03:42,809
I'm English!
Got a cigarette?

739
01:03:43,019 --> 01:03:50,760
Child device.
The mouth can be better used than

740
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:54,958
cylinder with a weed.
- Go ahead, make a speech!

741
01:03:58,935 --> 01:04:03,072
Our capitalist buccaneers,
what interests them?

742
01:04:03,072 --> 01:04:04,869
Machines are their ideals,

743
01:04:05,408 --> 01:04:10,112
paraphernalia to save labor,
substitutes, manufactured monsters

744
01:04:10,112 --> 01:04:14,650
to murder each other.
Rubbish produced by capitalists,

745
01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:19,053
take care of ordinary work.
The poor starve in the meantime.

746
01:04:26,128 --> 01:04:28,995
Three times the Lord to live in Dublin!

747
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:32,466
Viva!

748
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:44,914
- For the love of God is Bloom?
- There goes the famous Bloom,

749
01:04:44,914 --> 01:04:49,252
the biggest innovator in the world.
- All men saw!

750
01:04:49,252 --> 01:04:50,776
And they did!

751
01:04:52,622 --> 01:04:55,825
A classic face,
He has the forehead of a thinker.

752
01:04:55,825 --> 01:04:59,562
I now present,
Its powerful emperor,

753
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:08,337
president and king, the most serene,
and more competent ruler of the kingdom,

754
01:05:08,337 --> 01:05:10,430
God save Leopold!

755
01:05:16,445 --> 01:05:19,312
Thanks!
His Eminence, anything!

756
01:05:19,715 --> 01:05:23,686
You will use
the power of its law and mercy,

757
01:05:23,686 --> 01:05:29,522
for the execution of all judgments
Ireland and the nearby territories?

758
01:05:30,359 --> 01:05:33,229
Let the Creator deal with me!
All this, I promise to do!

759
01:05:33,229 --> 01:05:35,925
Let the Creator deal with me!
All this, I promise to do!

760
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:47,440
Andrew Patrick David Leopold
George, is crowned!

761
01:05:52,014 --> 01:05:55,418
I become his companion,
in life and death,

762
01:05:55,418 --> 01:05:57,716
to land the job.

763
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:04,851
My subjects!

764
01:06:05,428 --> 01:06:10,499
I am here to announce that today
repudiate our current wife

765
01:06:10,499 --> 01:06:15,960
and get our hands real
for the princess Selene,

766
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:19,673
the splendor of the night!

767
01:06:31,721 --> 01:06:34,123
Green socks,
you're good for your country!

768
01:06:34,123 --> 01:06:35,954
He is the man
that Ireland needs!

769
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:40,763
My beloved subjects,
a new day will dawn.

770
01:06:40,763 --> 01:06:48,871
I, Bloom, tell them in fact,
that is in my hands!

771
01:06:48,871 --> 01:06:52,932
You should enter
to the golden city,

772
01:06:53,376 --> 01:06:59,815
to be called the New Bloomusalm
New Hibernia of the future!

773
01:06:59,815 --> 01:07:01,517
Dad!

774
01:07:01,517 --> 01:07:06,352
Clap for Poldy!

775
01:07:07,757 --> 01:07:11,460
Aleph, Beth, Ghimmel, Kosher,
Yom, Kippur, Beni Brith, Meshuggah.

776
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:15,297
Remember me, Mr. Leo? Mandel
A dozen roses for your lady!

777
01:07:15,297 --> 01:07:19,135
You want to take advantage of me.
Lady Bloom accepts no presents!

778
01:07:19,135 --> 01:07:22,038
This is a holiday!
What do you call a feast,

779
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:23,471
I call the sacrament!

780
01:07:23,939 --> 01:07:29,412
I advocate the reform of the principles
the municipality and the 10 commandments!

781
01:07:29,412 --> 01:07:33,516
New worlds for old: Jews,

782
01:07:33,516 --> 01:07:37,486
Muslims and Gentiles.
Free currency, free love and

783
01:07:37,486 --> 01:07:41,590
a free church in a free state!
- And free fox the henhouse?

784
01:07:41,590 --> 01:07:43,526
Mixed races
and mixed marriages!

785
01:07:43,526 --> 01:07:46,429
- What about mixed bathing?
- He is Episcopalian, search

786
01:07:46,429 --> 01:07:51,025
exceed our sacred faith!
- Beast, you are an abominable person!

787
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:54,470
Give us a tune, Bloom.
One of his old songs!

788
01:07:54,470 --> 01:07:57,973
<i> I swore I would never leave, </ i>
<i> it proved to be a cruel betrayal, </ i>

789
01:07:57,973 --> 01:08:01,636
<i> with tooraloom, tooraloom, </ i>
<i> tooraloom, aiei </ i>

790
01:08:02,378 --> 01:08:05,279
Good old Bloom,
There is nobody like him!

791
01:08:05,614 --> 01:08:09,385
- Irish stage!
- He uses a machine

792
01:08:09,385 --> 01:08:12,455
from time to thwart
the sacred nature!

793
01:08:12,455 --> 01:08:15,691
Christian friends,
anti-people and Bloom,

794
01:08:15,691 --> 01:08:19,821
the man called Bloom,
comes from the depths of hell!

795
01:08:20,329 --> 01:08:25,434
A libertine demonic
Adoring wife of the red

796
01:08:25,434 --> 01:08:29,138
the wooden stakes and
cauldrons of oil, are to him!

797
01:08:29,138 --> 01:08:30,639
- Caliban!
- Lynch him!

798
01:08:30,639 --> 01:08:32,475
- Thrash him!
- He's as bad as Parnell!

799
01:08:32,475 --> 01:08:35,377
This is a true madness,
I'm innocent!

800
01:08:35,377 --> 01:08:39,448
I'll call my old friend,
Dr Malachi Mulligan,

801
01:08:39,448 --> 01:08:44,286
sexual expert, to make
medical tests on my defense!

802
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:47,813
Dr. Bloom
bisexually abnormal.

803
01:08:48,724 --> 01:08:52,294
Since birth,
epilepsy was present,

804
01:08:52,294 --> 01:08:55,525
consequence
of uncontrollable lust.

805
01:08:56,298 --> 01:09:01,170
There are symptoms of exhibitionism
chronic, ambidexterity is also latent.

806
01:09:01,170 --> 01:09:03,706
He was prematurely
unmasked by self-abuse

807
01:09:03,706 --> 01:09:05,674
perversity idealistic
as a consequence.

808
01:09:05,674 --> 01:09:09,508
Declared a lecher,
which has metal teeth.

809
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:14,717
I did a vaginal examination,
and then applied an acid

810
01:09:14,717 --> 01:09:18,120
test anal, pectoral, axial
and pubic hair,

811
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:21,783
and declare the virgo intact.

812
01:09:25,127 --> 01:09:29,757
Professor Bloom has proved a
example of the new man effeminate.

813
01:09:29,965 --> 01:09:33,628
His moral nature is
simple and lovely.

814
01:09:34,203 --> 01:09:39,641
Many consider him a
wanted man, a dear person.

815
01:09:39,808 --> 01:09:43,946
He is an exotic subject in general,
shy but not weak-mental

816
01:09:43,946 --> 01:09:45,573
in the medical sense.

817
01:09:46,248 --> 01:09:49,649
Another report says
he was a child late.

818
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:52,114
I ask for clemency.

819
01:09:52,988 --> 01:09:58,290
On behalf of the most sacred thing
that our bodies can carry.

820
01:09:59,428 --> 01:10:01,225
He is about to have a baby!

821
01:10:06,001 --> 01:10:12,274
- Ah, want to have a baby!
- Bloom, you are the Messiah?

822
01:10:12,274 --> 01:10:15,141
- Who told you!
- Then make a miracle!

823
01:10:16,278 --> 01:10:17,609
Prophesy!

824
01:10:18,314 --> 01:10:22,151
Okay,
the race of the Gold Cup?

825
01:10:22,151 --> 01:10:23,618
20-1!

826
01:10:26,121 --> 01:10:33,050
All the insanity, patriotism
and grief for the dead, must cease.

827
01:10:35,764 --> 01:10:37,733
Keep talking
and be boring!

828
01:10:37,733 --> 01:10:39,702
I bet that woke
with the left foot,

829
01:10:39,702 --> 01:10:42,102
or enjoyed too quickly
with his best girl.

830
01:10:42,471 --> 01:10:45,338
Ah,
I can read your thoughts!

831
01:10:45,608 --> 01:10:48,475
Men and women love.
What is this?

832
01:10:48,844 --> 01:10:52,248
- The cork and the bottle.
- I do not like to hear untruths.

833
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:54,079
Take a chance
an old hooker!

834
01:10:55,317 --> 01:11:00,311
I am very inconsistent.
You are a necessary evil.

835
01:11:01,223 --> 01:11:04,159
- Where? London?
- I was born in Yorkshire.

836
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:07,026
I will, Tommy Tittlemouse,
stop it and do the worst.

837
01:11:07,896 --> 01:11:10,799
He has money for more time?
10 shillings?

838
01:11:10,799 --> 01:11:13,702
- More baby, more!
- And more's the mother!

839
01:11:13,702 --> 01:11:15,499
Come and I'll undress me!

840
01:11:16,405 --> 01:11:21,069
You know, someone would
dreadfully jealous if she knew!

841
01:11:22,778 --> 01:11:26,305
Boys, do it now!
Tell your mother you'll be there.

842
01:11:27,016 --> 01:11:32,121
Unite now!
Sign up to join the eternal

843
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:36,148
a race without end!
You are gods,

844
01:11:36,692 --> 01:11:41,597
obstinate or stupid?
If the 2nd advent comes to Coney Island,

845
01:11:41,597 --> 01:11:47,263
be ready? Depends on
you, feel this cosmic force.

846
01:11:48,570 --> 01:11:52,472
We are aware of that is the cosmos?
No!

847
01:11:53,008 --> 01:11:57,604
Be on the side of angels
Now, witness!

848
01:11:59,281 --> 01:12:02,184
I forgot myself!
In a moment of weakness

849
01:12:02,184 --> 01:12:05,051
I messed up and did what I did
against the Constitution!

850
01:12:05,354 --> 01:12:08,290
A plumber was my undoing
when I was still pure.

851
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:13,395
It was a terrible consequence of
drunkenness in the Hennessy 3 stars.

852
01:12:13,395 --> 01:12:16,262
I became guilty with Whelan,
when he fell into bed.

853
01:12:16,565 --> 01:12:18,801
I let him play
with me for fun!

854
01:12:18,801 --> 01:12:22,635
In the beginning was the Word,
in the end, world without end.

855
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:26,206
Blessed be
eight followers.

856
01:12:32,314 --> 01:12:34,450
- Who has a cigarette?
- Here!

857
01:12:34,450 --> 01:12:37,353
Sing something,
Love's old sweet song!

858
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:40,189
I'm speechless.
I am almost finished an artist.

859
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:42,925
I think you
is a spoiled priest.

860
01:12:42,925 --> 01:12:44,324
Beg!

861
01:12:44,827 --> 01:12:46,556
That yes
is a good doggie!

862
01:12:56,605 --> 01:12:59,472
My God!
I'm all dirty with sweat.

863
01:13:11,353 --> 01:13:14,256
- Too tight?
- If you fail,

864
01:13:14,256 --> 01:13:17,692
Handy Andy,
I kick his balls!

865
01:13:18,293 --> 01:13:20,963
Waiting for your next orders
continue gentlemen ...

866
01:13:20,963 --> 01:13:25,401
- Manic dishonor!
- Empress!

867
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:28,971
- Worshipper of rituals adulterers!
- Gigante!

868
01:13:28,971 --> 01:13:31,838
- Worshipper of the dungeon!
- Magnificence!

869
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:36,007
Lower it!
Put one foot forward!

870
01:13:36,879 --> 01:13:41,816
Slide the left foot
a little behind!

871
01:13:42,684 --> 01:13:48,088
Will fall, is falling!
With hands down!

872
01:13:52,194 --> 01:13:53,320
Truffles!

873
01:13:54,863 --> 01:14:02,171
Feel my entire weight.
Bow down, slave, his despot.

874
01:14:02,171 --> 01:14:03,968
I promise never to disobey!

875
01:14:05,874 --> 01:14:08,777
Oh my God
You know what to expect!

876
01:14:08,777 --> 01:14:13,271
I'm the Tartar
quiet down and the yield!

877
01:14:15,751 --> 01:14:17,586
- She's not here!
- She's not here!

878
01:14:17,586 --> 01:14:19,121
She has not done on purpose
Mr. Bello

879
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:21,356
it will be a good girl!
- Do not be so hard on her,

880
01:14:21,356 --> 01:14:22,846
Mr. Bello
show a bit ...

881
01:14:23,058 --> 01:14:25,994
Come here sweetie,
I have a word with you

882
01:14:25,994 --> 01:14:31,296
just a correction.
A talk from the heart, sweetie!

883
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:34,203
There's a good girl now.

884
01:14:34,203 --> 01:14:41,109
I need to correct it for your sake,
a soft place and secure.

885
01:14:41,710 --> 01:14:44,577
How's the meat back here?

886
01:14:44,746 --> 01:14:49,046
Ah, gentle pet,
start preparing!

887
01:14:49,351 --> 01:14:52,254
- Do not tear my ...
- You will now see,

888
01:14:52,254 --> 01:14:55,587
I will do it to remember me
for life!

889
01:14:56,725 --> 01:14:59,626
- I'll hurt you!
- Oh, do not be so cruel, oh!

890
01:15:00,295 --> 01:15:03,198
- Is it hell!
- Good!

891
01:15:03,198 --> 01:15:06,101
Do not keep me waiting,
darn!

892
01:15:06,101 --> 01:15:08,237
You beat me,
I'll tell!

893
01:15:08,237 --> 01:15:11,139
Hang on girls,
so I can beat him!

894
01:15:11,139 --> 01:15:13,175
- Yeah, go on it!
- Let me go!

895
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:17,713
- No, I do!
- I see that the preferences

896
01:15:17,713 --> 01:15:21,240
Guinness are at 16 .

897
01:15:23,752 --> 01:15:26,619
Call me an idiot for not
have bought that lot!

898
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:31,250
And that damn stranger
Throwaway, won 20-1!

899
01:15:31,727 --> 01:15:34,594
Where is that
portion of ash cursed!

900
01:15:35,831 --> 01:15:38,698
Oh, cruel monster!

901
01:15:41,470 --> 01:15:44,337
Race Horse!

902
01:15:47,509 --> 01:15:52,674
Say, what was the scene more
obscene all his life of crime?

903
01:15:53,582 --> 01:15:57,814
The sins of the past!
Rise against you!

904
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:04,159
He underwent a
clandestine marriage,

905
01:16:04,159 --> 01:16:06,461
in the shadow of the black church.

906
01:16:06,461 --> 01:16:09,998
Messages unpronounceable
he sent mentally

907
01:16:09,998 --> 01:16:12,865
while the patient was,
naughty,

908
01:16:12,935 --> 01:16:14,698
the attendant telephone.

909
01:16:15,837 --> 01:16:19,875
5 ways for public
he sent messages,

910
01:16:19,875 --> 01:16:24,505
offering his partner,
all the strong men.

911
01:16:27,316 --> 01:16:29,418
Ah, I was a
real pig!

912
01:16:29,418 --> 01:16:33,622
Terrible things have given!
The foundation with the syringe

913
01:16:33,622 --> 01:16:35,556
Hamilton Long,
the friend of the ladies.

914
01:16:36,692 --> 01:16:40,395
Ah, get out your trash!
Hold your tongue!

915
01:16:40,395 --> 01:16:43,262
You can make a
men's work?

916
01:16:44,533 --> 01:16:49,271
I would not hurt their feelings,
but there is a man of muscle there.

917
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:51,707
I was indecently treated,
Ask the police!

918
01:16:51,707 --> 01:16:54,009
If you could inform,
duck idiot!

919
01:16:54,009 --> 01:16:56,876
We want a downpour,
not a drizzle!

920
01:17:02,684 --> 01:17:04,252
It seems to me
a fine night's work.

921
01:17:04,252 --> 01:17:06,388
- Smell it! Guess
or your money back.

922
01:17:06,388 --> 01:17:08,185
Ah, lobster and mayonnaise.

923
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:11,360
Hello, Bloom,
Ms. Bloom is ready?

924
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:14,227
Take, for buying
a gin or a water.

925
01:17:14,696 --> 01:17:17,563
Advertise me! I have business
with his wife, you know?

926
01:17:18,333 --> 01:17:21,200
Thank you, sir. Yes, sir.
Mrs. Bloom is in the bath.

927
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:23,705
Raoul, darling,
Come dry me!

928
01:17:23,705 --> 01:17:27,664
I'm just using my new
hat and a sponge!

929
01:17:30,012 --> 01:17:30,944
Going up!

930
01:17:41,323 --> 01:17:45,157
Let them watch!
Pimp, it is the whip!

931
01:17:46,194 --> 01:17:48,030
You can put your eye
in the keyhole and

932
01:17:48,030 --> 01:17:48,964
kidding himself

933
01:17:48,964 --> 01:17:50,522
while I go through
sometimes.

934
01:17:50,866 --> 01:17:52,163
Thank you, sir,
I will do it!

935
01:17:52,768 --> 01:17:55,635
Vaseline, sir? Flower
orange? Lavender water?

936
01:18:03,111 --> 01:18:05,671
- He idolizes!

937
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:11,510
Oh, look, he's carrying
the room while doing it!

938
01:18:15,123 --> 01:18:18,490
Show! Hide! Show!
Do it! More! Go!

939
01:18:19,061 --> 01:18:23,930
Hey, this is not a musical concert!
And do not beat around the piano!

940
01:18:24,666 --> 01:18:26,293
Who is paying?

941
01:18:30,439 --> 01:18:31,873
I asked who is paying?

942
01:18:31,873 --> 01:18:34,740
Here,
we're all on the same side!

943
01:18:35,110 --> 01:18:37,012
Dedalus,
give her blessing to her.

944
01:18:37,012 --> 01:18:38,013
She has!

945
01:18:38,013 --> 01:18:40,914
You want three girls,
here are 10 shillings.

946
01:18:42,684 --> 01:18:44,777
So apologies 100,000.

947
01:18:45,687 --> 01:18:48,554
- It was been behind my back!
- Allow me!

948
01:18:49,491 --> 01:18:51,652
3 times 10, we're even.

949
01:18:52,627 --> 01:18:55,494
You're bold, doggie!
Could kiss you!

950
01:18:57,866 --> 01:18:59,390
Here it is yours!

951
01:19:00,302 --> 01:19:01,200
How so?

952
01:19:02,204 --> 01:19:05,571
Look, it was better you have given me
the money to take care,

953
01:19:06,308 --> 01:19:07,576
why pay more?

954
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:10,909
- Be just before generous.
- I will be, but it is too much?

955
01:19:11,513 --> 01:19:13,915
Do not blame me
so lost!

956
01:19:13,915 --> 01:19:15,610
I do not care one bit!

957
01:19:17,486 --> 01:19:21,857
See, our friend!
Noise in the street.

958
01:19:21,857 --> 01:19:24,724
Look, dear,
I am, let's dance!

959
01:19:41,543 --> 01:19:44,410
I was once a beautiful flower in May,
Dedalus!

960
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:47,781
- I'm dead.
- Jesus, who are you?

961
01:19:48,216 --> 01:19:50,285
What idiot is doing
this joke?

962
01:19:50,285 --> 01:19:53,152
Mockery!
She kicked the bucket!

963
01:19:53,922 --> 01:19:56,789
Everyone should go through this,
Stephen. You too!

964
01:19:57,392 --> 01:20:00,295
- The time will come!
- They say I killed her mother.

965
01:20:00,295 --> 01:20:04,026
He offended your memory.
The cancer killed her, not me!

966
01:20:04,299 --> 01:20:06,434
- Destination!
- You sang that song

967
01:20:06,434 --> 01:20:08,561
for me, "Love's bitter mystery."

968
01:20:08,804 --> 01:20:12,240
Tell me if you know the word, mother,
the word known to man.

969
01:20:12,507 --> 01:20:15,999
Who had pity for you when
was sad in the midst of strangers?

970
01:20:16,478 --> 01:20:20,148
Prayers are powerful,
Repent, Stephen!

971
01:20:20,148 --> 01:20:24,949
- Monsters, hyena!
- I pray for you in another world.

972
01:20:25,253 --> 01:20:30,691
Let your food do Dilly,
every night after work.

973
01:20:30,926 --> 01:20:34,293
For years and years,
I loved my son!

974
01:20:34,496 --> 01:20:37,432
My first son,
when you were in my womb.

975
01:20:37,432 --> 01:20:40,235
- It's hot, I'm melting!
- Look, he is white.

976
01:20:40,235 --> 01:20:43,796
- Hey, Giddy, has no window!
- Repent,

977
01:20:44,372 --> 01:20:47,709
ah, the hell-fire!
- The leech eats the head

978
01:20:47,709 --> 01:20:50,576
and bloody bones.
- Beware!

979
01:20:50,946 --> 01:20:53,813
- Be careful with the hand of God!
- Silence!

980
01:20:54,149 --> 01:20:55,343
Add cold water to it.

981
01:20:56,484 --> 01:20:59,955
Oh Sacred Heart of Jesus,
have mercy on the soul of Stephen,

982
01:20:59,955 --> 01:21:03,525
save it from hell
with his Sacred Heart.

983
01:21:03,525 --> 01:21:07,825
No! Break my spirit
if any of you can!

984
01:21:08,463 --> 01:21:11,099
- I'll take you all to hell!
- Lord have mercy

985
01:21:11,099 --> 01:21:16,905
Stephen, for me!
Was my inexpressible grief,

986
01:21:16,905 --> 01:21:22,138
When overflowing with love,
pain and agony on Calvary!

987
01:21:22,544 --> 01:21:23,909
No!

988
01:21:26,581 --> 01:21:27,411
Imbecile!

989
01:21:28,416 --> 01:21:29,246
Stop right there!

990
01:21:30,685 --> 01:21:34,489
Who pays for the chandelier there?
You were with him!

991
01:21:34,489 --> 01:21:35,957
- What buff, woman?
- Who pays?

992
01:21:35,957 --> 01:21:38,860
- 10 shillings!
- 10 shillings?

993
01:21:38,860 --> 01:21:40,962
Did not take too much money from it?

994
01:21:40,962 --> 01:21:43,665
Do not give me this conversation
this is not a slum!

995
01:21:43,665 --> 01:21:47,362
- It's a house of 10 shillings!
- The damage did not cost it!

996
01:21:55,744 --> 01:21:57,177
Your ...

997
01:21:57,679 --> 01:22:00,147
- He insulted?
- I spoke in vocative feminine.

998
01:22:00,649 --> 01:22:02,584
I was with the soldiers,
and they let me do,

999
01:22:02,584 --> 01:22:04,953
you know, so a
Young ran after me.

1000
01:22:04,953 --> 01:22:07,856
But I'm faithful to the man who cares
me, even being a prostitute.

1001
01:22:07,856 --> 01:22:13,328
- Tell what happened right!
- I was with the soldiers!

1002
01:22:13,328 --> 01:22:15,997
Why not?
The brave soldier!

1003
01:22:15,997 --> 01:22:18,366
How then would
if I broke his jaw?

1004
01:22:18,366 --> 01:22:21,169
How? Too bad.
Noble art of pretension,

1005
01:22:21,169 --> 01:22:22,504
personally
I detest action.

1006
01:22:22,504 --> 01:22:24,404
Come on, professor,
the car is waiting.

1007
01:22:25,373 --> 01:22:27,739
What were you saying?
Repeat!

1008
01:22:27,876 --> 01:22:31,313
I understand your point of view.
I believe that to die for their country,

1009
01:22:31,313 --> 01:22:34,849
but I'd rather have my country die
by me and so far have been well.

1010
01:22:34,849 --> 01:22:36,651
Under death
Long live life!

1011
01:22:36,651 --> 01:22:38,553
Hey, Harry,
Give a kick to his balls!

1012
01:22:38,553 --> 01:22:40,021
Look,
he does not know what it says,

1013
01:22:40,021 --> 01:22:41,656
drank a little more
than it should.

1014
01:22:41,656 --> 01:22:44,025
I know him well, is a
gentleman and poet.

1015
01:22:44,025 --> 01:22:46,528
- I do not care who he is!
- We do not care who he is!

1016
01:22:46,528 --> 01:22:48,463
We said nothing,
not a word!

1017
01:22:48,463 --> 01:22:51,366
- It's just a misunderstanding.
- Come on, Harry, hit him in the eye!

1018
01:22:51,366 --> 01:22:53,468
Hit you if you
give me space, okay?

1019
01:22:53,468 --> 01:22:56,438
Fair fight here, do the butcher
bloody go out for shopping!

1020
01:22:56,438 --> 01:22:59,674
- They will fight for my cause!
- Come on, before it starts to fight!

1021
01:22:59,674 --> 01:23:05,547
Oh, come on, you fool, he would
insulted but I forgive, I forgive you!

1022
01:23:05,547 --> 01:23:07,682
I'll insult him!

1023
01:23:07,682 --> 01:23:09,417
Get out, get away!

1024
01:23:09,417 --> 01:23:10,850
Police!

1025
01:23:14,856 --> 01:23:17,258
- What happened here?
- Let me in, I can ...

1026
01:23:17,258 --> 01:23:19,494
Do not want to instructions
how I do my job.

1027
01:23:19,494 --> 01:23:22,361
- Name?
- He is the son of Simon Dedalus.

1028
01:23:22,931 --> 01:23:25,832
It's a little stubborn.
Won money on a race today.

1029
01:23:26,167 --> 01:23:28,499
I was drinking and
he tried to follow me.

1030
01:23:29,070 --> 01:23:31,095
I can take care of him,
Sergeant!

1031
01:23:31,373 --> 01:23:33,466
This can happen
with anyone, right?

1032
01:23:33,742 --> 01:23:36,077
- Sure you can, sir!
- Boys are boys!

1033
01:23:36,077 --> 01:23:37,408
I can take it home!

1034
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:50,117
C'mon! Hey, Mr Dedalus?
Stephen?

1035
01:23:52,394 --> 01:23:53,326
Who?

1036
01:23:57,065 --> 01:23:59,260
The face reminds me
his poor mother.

1037
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:07,099
Rudy?

1038
01:24:27,195 --> 01:24:30,098
In return,
they talked about music,

1039
01:24:30,098 --> 01:24:36,471
literature, Ireland, Paris, friendship,
women, prostitution, diet

1040
01:24:36,471 --> 01:24:39,374
and the Roman Catholic Church.

1041
01:24:39,374 --> 01:24:43,344
Bloom found common factors of
similarity between their positive reactions

1042
01:24:43,344 --> 01:24:44,709
and the negative experiences?

1043
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:48,683
Both were sensitive
to art, music,

1044
01:24:48,683 --> 01:24:51,584
Preferably
of plastic and paint.

1045
01:24:52,087 --> 01:24:55,790
Both demonstrated disbelief
in many orthodox religions,

1046
01:24:55,790 --> 01:24:58,693
in social doctrines,
national and ethnic.

1047
01:24:58,693 --> 01:25:01,560
That reaction was Bloom,
arrival at your destination?

1048
01:25:02,163 --> 01:25:06,367
On arrival at the 4th house,
of equal squares,

1049
01:25:06,367 --> 01:25:11,206
the number 7 Eccles Street,
He automatically put his hand

1050
01:25:11,206 --> 01:25:14,142
in the back pocket of his jeans,
to get his key.

1051
01:25:14,142 --> 01:25:14,409
- She was there?
- I was in my pants pocket

1052
01:25:14,409 --> 01:25:17,779
- She was there?
- I was in my pants pocket

1053
01:25:17,779 --> 01:25:21,112
corresponding to the pants
used the previous day.

1054
01:25:22,650 --> 01:25:25,987
- Why was angry again?
- Because he forgot and then

1055
01:25:25,987 --> 01:25:30,515
remembered he had remembered
himself not to forget!

1056
01:25:42,604 --> 01:25:44,973
What appears to the host,
are the main qualities

1057
01:25:44,973 --> 01:25:46,065
guest?

1058
01:25:46,875 --> 01:25:48,137
Confidence in him.

1059
01:25:48,676 --> 01:25:52,874
An equal and opposite power
of abandonment and recuperation.

1060
01:25:53,748 --> 01:25:54,646
As for humor?

1061
01:25:55,617 --> 01:25:58,484
He did not dare,
he did not expect,

1062
01:25:59,787 --> 01:26:03,314
was not disappointed,
he was satisfied.

1063
01:26:04,993 --> 01:26:07,860
Pleased not to have sustained
a positive loss,

1064
01:26:09,063 --> 01:26:11,395
gain offered by having
positive to others.

1065
01:26:12,033 --> 01:26:13,967
Light to the Gentiles.

1066
01:26:18,306 --> 01:26:21,935
What made his first verse
original, written by him,

1067
01:26:22,744 --> 01:26:24,837
a poet in potential
with 11 years of age,

1068
01:26:25,547 --> 01:26:28,449
on occasion where
offered three prizes of 10, 5 and 2,

1069
01:26:28,449 --> 01:26:32,510
shillings respectively, in a competition
Shamrock, a weekly newspaper?

1070
01:26:33,521 --> 01:26:36,758
An ambition oblique
In my verse printed

1071
01:26:36,758 --> 01:26:39,661
Makes me hope
find that space?

1072
01:26:39,661 --> 01:26:43,097
If you surrender,
Please put in the end,

1073
01:26:43,097 --> 01:26:46,624
The name of your sweetheart,
L. Bloom.

1074
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:49,534
They spoke openly
about their racial difference?

1075
01:26:50,972 --> 01:26:54,542
None. What, if reduced
its simple

1076
01:26:54,542 --> 01:26:56,377
reciprocally,
where thought to Bloom

1077
01:26:56,377 --> 01:26:59,280
on the thought of Stephen
on Bloom, and thought

1078
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:03,444
Stephen on thought
Bloom about Stephen.

1079
01:27:03,918 --> 01:27:06,287
He thought that he thought
he was a Jew,

1080
01:27:06,287 --> 01:27:09,154
although he knew he
I knew he knew he was not.

1081
01:27:10,825 --> 01:27:15,194
Why Bloom refused to say that
had attended the university of life?

1082
01:27:15,663 --> 01:27:20,401
Because its buoyant uncertainty
on the observation had

1083
01:27:20,401 --> 01:27:23,338
or had not been made
by him to Stephen

1084
01:27:23,338 --> 01:27:25,431
nor by Stephen to him.

1085
01:27:27,208 --> 01:27:30,507
What two temperaments
individually represent?

1086
01:27:31,079 --> 01:27:33,513
The scientific, artistic.

1087
01:27:34,415 --> 01:27:37,282
What is home
without Plumtree's Potted Meat?

1088
01:27:38,286 --> 01:27:39,344
Incomplete.

1089
01:27:40,655 --> 01:27:42,452
With a void of contentment.

1090
01:27:43,891 --> 01:27:47,228
Which domestic problem as it is,
if not more than any other,

1091
01:27:47,228 --> 01:27:49,162
often
disruption to your mind?

1092
01:27:49,831 --> 01:27:51,298
What to do with our wives.

1093
01:27:52,634 --> 01:27:57,171
Stephen Bloom proposed that it pass
the hours between today and tomorrow

1094
01:27:57,171 --> 01:28:02,877
between the kitchen in the apartment
and the dormitory for guests.

1095
01:28:02,877 --> 01:28:06,369
Some advantages may appear
the extension of this Agreement.

1096
01:28:06,848 --> 01:28:09,715
For Stephen, home insurance
and stability of education.

1097
01:28:10,084 --> 01:28:14,578
For Bloom, rejuvenation
intelligence, satisfaction of care.

1098
01:28:15,156 --> 01:28:18,092
For Molly, the disintegration of
obsession and acquisition of pronunciation

1099
01:28:18,092 --> 01:28:21,687
Stephen perfect Italian.

1100
01:28:23,131 --> 01:28:26,034
This proposed asylum
was accepted?

1101
01:28:26,034 --> 01:28:33,167
Gently inexplicably
Kindly, thankfully, he refused.

1102
01:28:37,045 --> 01:28:42,283
What confronted them when they,
The first host, then the guest,

1103
01:28:42,283 --> 01:28:46,988
emerged silently,
in the dark and obscure passage

1104
01:28:46,988 --> 01:28:50,287
row house
to the shadows of the garden.

1105
01:28:51,092 --> 01:28:55,119
The starry sky has long
with fruit wet night.

1106
01:28:56,698 --> 01:28:59,634
Both were silent.

1107
01:28:59,634 --> 01:29:05,197
Silence, contemplating one another,
the mirror of his flesh with each other,

1108
01:29:05,606 --> 01:29:08,473
in his or his,
friendly face.

1109
01:29:09,444 --> 01:29:13,281
The trajectory of his first
simultaneous action of urine,

1110
01:29:13,281 --> 01:29:16,951
was uneven.
The Bloom's was longer,

1111
01:29:16,951 --> 01:29:21,786
less noisy, the Stephen
was higher, more sibilant.

1112
01:29:22,323 --> 01:29:24,859
Who in the last hours
the previous day,

1113
01:29:24,859 --> 01:29:30,058
argued for a consumption
diuretic, an insistent pressure.

1114
01:29:32,533 --> 01:29:35,400
Alone, which Bloom hear?

1115
01:29:36,337 --> 01:29:40,808
The double reverberation of the foot,
reborn on earth,

1116
01:29:40,808 --> 01:29:45,507
double body vibration
a Jew, the resonant surface.

1117
01:29:45,780 --> 01:29:50,118
Alone, Bloom feels the cold
stellar space,

1118
01:29:50,118 --> 01:29:54,919
the subpoena incipient
the approach of dawn.

1119
01:29:56,124 --> 01:29:58,526
What imperfections
a perfect day,

1120
01:29:58,526 --> 01:30:03,862
Bloom, walking, silently
truly sets?

1121
01:30:04,799 --> 01:30:08,736
A fault condition,
to renew an ad

1122
01:30:08,736 --> 01:30:14,242
certify the presence or absence
lower rectal orifice,

1123
01:30:14,242 --> 01:30:18,508
in the case of deities
Hellenic female.

1124
01:30:22,116 --> 01:30:25,019
In response to questioning
night of his wife,

1125
01:30:25,019 --> 01:30:28,389
Bloom omits the information
public trial in the neighborhood

1126
01:30:28,389 --> 01:30:31,256
that with the permit
Bernard Kiernan

1127
01:30:31,826 --> 01:30:35,763
showed an erotic provocation,
therefore, young lady;

1128
01:30:35,763 --> 01:30:41,002
and reveals the reference volume
pornographic and sinful:

1129
01:30:41,002 --> 01:30:43,903
"Sweets of Sin."

1130
01:30:45,072 --> 01:30:46,699
Bloom's acts.

1131
01:30:48,910 --> 01:30:53,748
Wisely ...
entering the lair of traps

1132
01:30:53,748 --> 01:30:58,352
lust and snakes,
clearly, to care less,

1133
01:30:58,352 --> 01:31:03,289
respectfully, the bed
conception and birth,

1134
01:31:04,091 --> 01:31:08,892
consummation of marriage
and the opening of marriage;

1135
01:31:09,197 --> 01:31:12,098
sleeping and dying.

1136
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:14,669
What did its members,
when gradually

1137
01:31:14,669 --> 01:31:17,536
stretched to meet?
- New linens,

1138
01:31:18,239 --> 01:31:22,300
additional odors,
the presence of the human form

1139
01:31:22,577 --> 01:31:30,985
female, hers, printing
the male human form,

1140
01:31:30,985 --> 01:31:32,350
not his.

1141
01:31:33,154 --> 01:31:37,352
Some crumbs,
some pieces of meat,

1142
01:31:37,758 --> 01:31:40,625
reheated,
that he removed.

1143
01:31:41,062 --> 01:31:43,364
What were the last thoughts,
and that was the last

1144
01:31:43,364 --> 01:31:44,854
occupant of the bed?

1145
01:31:45,533 --> 01:31:50,271
Reflections on his force,
commonly the body proportion,

1146
01:31:50,271 --> 01:31:57,144
Bat, business skill,
the best, amazingly,

1147
01:31:57,144 --> 01:32:00,011
worthless.

1148
01:32:02,550 --> 01:32:06,687
What event or person emerged
as a salient point of his narration?

1149
01:32:06,687 --> 01:32:09,554
Stephen Dedalus,
teacher and author.

1150
01:32:10,258 --> 01:32:13,194
During the course of this brief
ascending and narration,

1151
01:32:13,194 --> 01:32:16,130
the narrator and the listener
are called to demonstrate

1152
01:32:16,130 --> 01:32:19,901
the limits of compatibility
marriage, where a complete

1153
01:32:19,901 --> 01:32:25,406
carnal intercourse with ejaculation
semen in the female organ,

1154
01:32:25,406 --> 01:32:30,344
is not made 10 years ago,
5 months and 18 days.

1155
01:32:30,344 --> 01:32:35,082
That was five weeks before
Birth and death of his only

1156
01:32:35,082 --> 01:32:41,146
son Rudolph Bloom Junior
11 days of life.

1157
01:32:42,156 --> 01:32:46,294
A boy exhausted
a child in the womb.

1158
01:32:46,294 --> 01:32:49,627
Belly exhausted.
He rests.

1159
01:32:50,464 --> 01:32:54,602
He traveled,
with Sinbad the Sailor

1160
01:32:54,602 --> 01:32:58,739
Tinbad and the Tailor
Jinbad and the Gaoler,

1161
01:32:58,739 --> 01:33:04,405
Ninbad and the Preacher,
Whinbad and the Whale, e. ..

1162
01:33:15,356 --> 01:33:16,757
Yes

1163
01:33:16,757 --> 01:33:19,994
because he has never done anything like this,
how to order your coffee

1164
01:33:19,994 --> 01:33:22,861
in bed with two eggs.

1165
01:33:23,764 --> 01:33:25,561
Bring your coffee?

1166
01:33:27,435 --> 01:33:28,367
Yes

1167
01:33:28,836 --> 01:33:31,737
it came from somewhere,
I'm sure by his appetite.

1168
01:33:32,940 --> 01:33:34,976
Anyway,
love is not,

1169
01:33:34,976 --> 01:33:36,773
but would inappetent
thinking about it.

1170
01:33:37,445 --> 01:33:40,312
Is it any bitch or someone
he got there.

1171
01:33:41,015 --> 01:33:43,882
If they knew him
as well as I ...

1172
01:33:44,251 --> 01:33:47,922
someone who may find
tenderness, because all men

1173
01:33:47,922 --> 01:33:51,517
are thus well as boot
all the money they can from it.

1174
01:33:51,892 --> 01:33:54,224
The biggest idiots
are old.

1175
01:33:55,129 --> 01:33:57,996
And pulled my bag
to disguise!

1176
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:02,959
Not that I care,
but I wonder.

1177
01:34:03,638 --> 01:34:07,408
As long as I do not have the two
on my toes all the time

1178
01:34:07,408 --> 01:34:10,311
like that bitch,

1179
01:34:10,311 --> 01:34:15,339
Mary that we had,
inflating your ass to excite him.

1180
01:34:16,150 --> 01:34:19,017
A woman is not enough for them.

1181
01:34:23,057 --> 01:34:25,958
I do not stoop
about to spy on them.

1182
01:34:26,727 --> 01:34:29,664
Yes, because he would not be
so long without,

1183
01:34:29,664 --> 01:34:31,899
should do so
somewhere.

1184
01:34:31,899 --> 01:34:35,630
Just to ruin
a woman, no satisfaction,

1185
01:34:37,071 --> 01:34:40,741
hoping to enjoy it and then
having to end up alone anyway.

1186
01:34:40,741 --> 01:34:42,402
This makes
your lips turn pale.

1187
01:34:43,944 --> 01:34:46,412
Anyway,
is done once and for all.

1188
01:34:47,615 --> 01:34:50,518
Everybody talks
about it,

1189
01:34:50,518 --> 01:34:52,452
but it is only the first time,

1190
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:57,224
after a situation is so common
not more talk.

1191
01:34:57,224 --> 01:35:00,853
Why can not kiss a man
without having to marry him?

1192
01:35:01,328 --> 01:35:05,633
First comes the feeling crazy
and then get as good

1193
01:35:05,633 --> 01:35:08,536
that can not be avoided.

1194
01:35:08,536 --> 01:35:14,736
There's nothing like a long hot
kiss, which almost paralyzes us.

1195
01:35:15,876 --> 01:35:18,743
And I hate to admit me
with Father Corrigan.

1196
01:35:19,747 --> 01:35:23,046
He touched me, Father.
Is there anything wrong with that?

1197
01:35:23,718 --> 01:35:24,776
Where?

1198
01:35:25,352 --> 01:35:30,424
And I told the channel.
But where exactly you,

1199
01:35:30,424 --> 01:35:33,327
my daughter?
On the back of the leg.

1200
01:35:33,327 --> 01:35:36,194
At the high end?
Yes, Father, at discharge.

1201
01:35:37,098 --> 01:35:39,794
That's where you sit?
Yes

1202
01:35:40,234 --> 01:35:43,101
My God, he could not
say ass and just to clarify?

1203
01:35:43,337 --> 01:35:45,172
What is the problem?

1204
01:35:45,172 --> 01:35:48,509
And you ...
I do not know what he said, I forgot.

1205
01:35:48,509 --> 01:35:49,771
No, Father!

1206
01:35:50,244 --> 01:35:52,713
And I always think
the real father.

1207
01:35:52,713 --> 01:35:55,580
What he wants to know,
when I already confessed to God?

1208
01:35:56,817 --> 01:35:59,684
I wonder:
Did I know about the cabin?

1209
01:36:00,387 --> 01:36:03,290
I could see his face,
will he could see mine?

1210
01:36:03,290 --> 01:36:06,157
Of course, I never would face.

1211
01:36:07,061 --> 01:36:09,962
They're dying for a woman
course.

1212
01:36:10,631 --> 01:36:13,532
Would you be satisfied with me?

1213
01:36:13,868 --> 01:36:16,771
Something I did not like
was to have him hitting me

1214
01:36:16,771 --> 01:36:21,902
behind when I was leaving,
so intimate that I got to laugh.

1215
01:36:23,677 --> 01:36:26,544
I am not a horse,
or an ass, am I?

1216
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:32,920
Is he awake
thinking or dreaming of me?

1217
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:36,056
We went to the port
and clean fish

1218
01:36:36,056 --> 01:36:39,393
I had a salty smell,
yes, because I felt

1219
01:36:39,393 --> 01:36:42,329
nice and tired and I fell asleep
so I fell into bed.

1220
01:36:42,329 --> 01:36:46,834
This crappy old bed
shaking like a cab!

1221
01:36:46,834 --> 01:36:49,103
I guess you can hear us
across the street.

1222
01:36:49,103 --> 01:36:51,372
So I suggested
we put the quilt on the floor,

1223
01:36:51,372 --> 01:36:53,772
with pillow
under my butt.

1224
01:36:54,275 --> 01:36:55,109
Terrible thunder scared me
like those thunderstorms in Gibraltar.

1225
01:36:55,109 --> 01:36:57,907
Terrible thunder scared me
like those thunderstorms in Gibraltar.

1226
01:37:02,082 --> 01:37:04,949
And they come
and say that God does not exist

1227
01:37:05,386 --> 01:37:07,655
and mockery if he heard this,
because it never goes to church

1228
01:37:07,655 --> 01:37:09,088
in masses or meetings.

1229
01:37:09,356 --> 01:37:11,625
He says about the soul,
we have no soul in us,

1230
01:37:11,625 --> 01:37:12,887
only the gray matter.

1231
01:37:13,394 --> 01:37:15,328
He does not know what is
why not have one.

1232
01:37:16,597 --> 01:37:20,033
Yes
Because he has 3 or 4 times

1233
01:37:20,367 --> 01:37:23,234
with that huge thing
Gross and he has.

1234
01:37:24,238 --> 01:37:25,967
Your nose is not so great!

1235
01:37:26,807 --> 01:37:29,743
Later he took all my
clothes with the blinds closed,

1236
01:37:29,743 --> 01:37:33,440
hours after dressing myself,
perfuming and combing me me

1237
01:37:34,081 --> 01:37:36,948
as a steel
or some kind of crowbar.

1238
01:37:37,084 --> 01:37:38,278
Standing all the time!

1239
01:37:38,419 --> 01:37:41,877
He must have eaten oysters,
a dozen!

1240
01:37:42,356 --> 01:37:44,449
He had a beautiful voice

1241
01:37:45,526 --> 01:37:49,330
and I never found anyone
in life with a size of those,

1242
01:37:49,330 --> 01:37:51,059
that make you feel
fully populated.

1243
01:37:51,532 --> 01:37:53,734
What is the idea that we do
this way,

1244
01:37:53,734 --> 01:37:55,463
with a hole in the middle?

1245
01:37:56,103 --> 01:37:58,138
They come as a stallion
Up to you,

1246
01:37:58,138 --> 01:38:02,042
because that's all they want.
That bad look and determined.

1247
01:38:02,042 --> 01:38:05,944
I needed to be
with eyes half-closed,

1248
01:38:08,048 --> 01:38:12,152
even then, he has
that courage within yourself.

1249
01:38:12,152 --> 01:38:14,655
I did take out and put
me in considering

1250
01:38:14,655 --> 01:38:17,591
how great,
which is good if you have not

1251
01:38:17,591 --> 01:38:21,262
been washed properly.
Last time

1252
01:38:21,262 --> 01:38:23,196
I let him finish me.

1253
01:38:24,331 --> 01:38:26,767
What a beautiful invention made
for women

1254
01:38:26,767 --> 01:38:28,928
since they
get all the pleasure.

1255
01:38:29,336 --> 01:38:32,239
But if someone cares
with others, could know

1256
01:38:32,239 --> 01:38:34,541
through what I did with Rudy
Mina Purefoy and what goes

1257
01:38:34,541 --> 01:38:38,879
with her husband, who fills one with
son or two a year, like clockwork.

1258
01:38:38,879 --> 01:38:42,781
They are not satisfied while
do not see us as a swollen elephant.

1259
01:38:43,550 --> 01:38:45,575
What can be expected
a man like that?

1260
01:38:46,287 --> 01:38:49,688
I'd rather die than 20 times
I married again with one of them.

1261
01:38:50,157 --> 01:38:53,060
But of course he will not find
never a woman who

1262
01:38:53,060 --> 01:38:54,584
things with him like I do.

1263
01:38:56,397 --> 01:38:59,300
I liked the way
how she loved me,

1264
01:38:59,300 --> 01:39:05,170
he knew how to pick a woman,
8 when he sent me flowers,

1265
01:39:06,006 --> 01:39:08,907
But he could not embrace
as well as Gardner.

1266
01:39:09,977 --> 01:39:12,880
I looked a little bland,
clear when he looked at me closely

1267
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:14,279
my makeup in the mirror.

1268
01:39:16,717 --> 01:39:19,584
The mirror
never passes the expression.

1269
01:39:20,254 --> 01:39:23,157
In fact, lie on top of me
that way,

1270
01:39:23,157 --> 01:39:25,284
tapping its immense
hip bone,

1271
01:39:25,693 --> 01:39:28,560
it is heavy as well as having
the hairy chest to warm up.

1272
01:39:29,863 --> 01:39:32,093
Always having
that lie to them.

1273
01:39:32,866 --> 01:39:36,470
Even better if he caught me
behind, the way Mrs. Mastiansky

1274
01:39:36,470 --> 01:39:39,337
told me that her husband did,
just like dogs do.

1275
01:39:39,907 --> 01:39:43,399
Stretched the language
as far as I could.

1276
01:39:44,311 --> 01:39:47,178
You can understand a man
the way he is?

1277
01:39:47,548 --> 01:39:50,918
He looked like a devil by some
minutes later he returned saying

1278
01:39:50,918 --> 01:39:54,455
that the press was tearing
the tickets and swearing at all

1279
01:39:54,455 --> 01:39:58,125
because he said he had lost 20
pennies and lost even more to

1280
01:39:58,125 --> 01:40:01,026
the outsider who won the race.
So, would take me.

1281
01:40:02,062 --> 01:40:04,999
Anyway,
I want to make it

1282
01:40:04,999 --> 01:40:07,866
at least 2
chemises or 3 for me.

1283
01:40:08,535 --> 01:40:11,402
But I do not know
what kind of prints he likes.

1284
01:40:12,072 --> 01:40:13,505
Perhaps none.

1285
01:40:13,907 --> 01:40:15,534
He did not say?
Yes

1286
01:40:15,876 --> 01:40:18,743
And half the girls in
Gibraltar never wore one too!

1287
01:40:18,979 --> 01:40:20,446
Naked as God made them!

1288
01:40:21,548 --> 01:40:24,051
That Andalusian
singing her Manola,

1289
01:40:24,051 --> 01:40:26,286
did little secret
with what she had.

1290
01:40:26,286 --> 01:40:27,218
Yes

1291
01:40:28,989 --> 01:40:33,153
What are these veins?
I'm curious to know

1292
01:40:33,627 --> 01:40:36,494
how should be done,
2nd equal in the case of twins.

1293
01:40:36,663 --> 01:40:39,566
They should represent the beauty,
put up there

1294
01:40:39,566 --> 01:40:41,363
like statues in the museum.

1295
01:40:42,136 --> 01:40:45,037
One pretends to hide
with one hand.

1296
01:40:45,472 --> 01:40:46,962
They are so beautiful.

1297
01:40:47,541 --> 01:40:50,778
Compared with a man,
Of course, with their two suitcases

1298
01:40:50,778 --> 01:40:52,613
more floods and other
thing hanging on it,

1299
01:40:52,613 --> 01:40:55,516
or when it is standing on his
forward as a hat rack.

1300
01:40:55,516 --> 01:40:58,419
That's why hide
leaves behind!

1301
01:40:58,419 --> 01:41:01,286
The woman represents beauty,
Of course, they admit.

1302
01:41:01,989 --> 01:41:04,892
I wonder if they are not afraid
to take a kick,

1303
01:41:04,892 --> 01:41:07,793
or take a hit,
or something!

1304
01:41:08,862 --> 01:41:11,729
I ask that anyone
keep that in mind!

1305
01:41:12,666 --> 01:41:15,533
If I could remember
at least half of things,

1306
01:41:15,769 --> 01:41:17,031
I would write a book.

1307
01:41:18,472 --> 01:41:21,339
The work of the Master Poldy.

1308
01:41:22,042 --> 01:41:24,909
Be happy that these
men take a woman.

1309
01:41:25,813 --> 01:41:27,280
Feel your mouth.

1310
01:41:28,816 --> 01:41:31,717
Oh, Lord, I need to stretch me!

1311
01:41:34,221 --> 01:41:37,658
I wish he or someone
were here to make me

1312
01:41:37,658 --> 01:41:39,023
enjoy that way.

1313
01:41:39,693 --> 01:41:41,718
Feel the fire inside me.

1314
01:41:42,729 --> 01:41:45,632
Maybe if I could dream
with the time he was

1315
01:41:45,632 --> 01:41:48,535
the 2nd time running her fingers
behind me and I enjoyed

1316
01:41:48,535 --> 01:41:51,402
for nearly five minutes with my
legs around him.

1317
01:41:51,572 --> 01:41:53,130
I had to hug him afterward.

1318
01:41:53,607 --> 01:41:56,543
Oh God I wanted to scream
all kinds of stuff,

1319
01:41:56,543 --> 01:41:59,480
erotic words,
or something!

1320
01:41:59,480 --> 01:42:05,112
But without looking ugly
or with those lines.

1321
01:42:06,320 --> 01:42:07,912
Who knows how to react?

1322
01:42:08,489 --> 01:42:10,719
You want to feel good
with a man!

1323
01:42:12,159 --> 01:42:15,026
Not all are equal to him,
thank God!

1324
01:42:15,496 --> 01:42:18,363
Some want you
feel so good about it.

1325
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:24,299
I notice the difference!
There are those who do not speak!

1326
01:42:26,039 --> 01:42:31,111
I gave my eyes that look,
with her hair loose medium

1327
01:42:31,111 --> 01:42:33,046
and my tongue between
my lips,

1328
01:42:33,046 --> 01:42:36,083
going for him,
savage brute!

1329
01:42:36,083 --> 01:42:39,520
Ah, well I could still
find someone to give me

1330
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:43,149
what I want so much, that is to have
something hard inside.

1331
01:42:43,524 --> 01:42:47,016
We no longer have the same chances
we had before!

1332
01:42:48,162 --> 01:42:50,631
I would welcome someone
a love letter.

1333
01:42:50,631 --> 01:42:53,532
True or not,
it brightens your day and your life!

1334
01:42:54,201 --> 01:42:56,336
Always having something to think about,
every moment,

1335
01:42:56,336 --> 01:43:00,204
and witness to his back
a new world!

1336
01:43:00,641 --> 01:43:03,143
I could write
a response in bed, walking,

1337
01:43:03,143 --> 01:43:04,610
only a few words.

1338
01:43:05,412 --> 01:43:09,439
I never imagined that this
would be my name Bloom.

1339
01:43:09,983 --> 01:43:13,820
Well, better than those
Pinto with awful names.

1340
01:43:13,820 --> 01:43:17,620
Ms. Anna Pinto
or some other name with Pinto.

1341
01:43:19,426 --> 01:43:20,791
The train again!

1342
01:43:21,995 --> 01:43:23,724
Sound boring!

1343
01:43:32,172 --> 01:43:36,777
Close your eyes and breathe
my lips open.

1344
01:43:36,777 --> 01:43:41,578
Kiss, sad eyes,
eyes open, piano!

1345
01:43:48,622 --> 01:43:50,749
I hate these big words!

1346
01:43:57,931 --> 01:44:01,902
I'll make that clear from the next
time you're in the spotlight.

1347
01:44:01,902 --> 01:44:04,769
Kathleen Kearney
and their squirrels.

1348
01:44:04,972 --> 01:44:08,999
A bunch of puns Sparrow,
arrogant, talking about politics.

1349
01:44:09,309 --> 01:44:12,210
Understand it as well
on my backside.

1350
01:44:12,879 --> 01:44:15,048
I think she's submissive,
for no man

1351
01:44:15,048 --> 01:44:16,413
look at her twice.

1352
01:44:16,683 --> 01:44:19,386
Gardner said no man
could look at my mouth

1353
01:44:19,386 --> 01:44:22,289
teeth and smiling
without thinking about it.

1354
01:44:22,289 --> 01:44:24,458
I was afraid that he
might not like my accent.

1355
01:44:24,458 --> 01:44:26,722
Everything
my father left me.

1356
01:44:27,027 --> 01:44:30,197
And my mother left eye
and appearance in some way.

1357
01:44:30,197 --> 01:44:31,687
He died for my lips!

1358
01:44:32,132 --> 01:44:35,260
Women should find
a husband to look good!

1359
01:44:35,569 --> 01:44:37,604
And also one that excites
money,

1360
01:44:37,604 --> 01:44:40,507
those who can choose
whoever you want, as Boylan,

1361
01:44:40,507 --> 01:44:44,705
and still have sex 4 or 5 times
stuck in each others arms.

1362
01:44:45,245 --> 01:44:47,008
Or the voice too!

1363
01:44:47,414 --> 01:44:51,350
I might even be a first lady
but I married him!

1364
01:44:57,391 --> 01:44:59,660
Looking down,
with his chin down,

1365
01:44:59,660 --> 01:45:02,060
but not much
not to be twofold.

1366
01:45:03,230 --> 01:45:06,097
Have they
burning with envy!

1367
01:45:07,434 --> 01:45:10,337
Anyway,
I hope he does not meddle

1368
01:45:10,337 --> 01:45:13,240
with drugs that cross the illusion
he is young again

1369
01:45:13,240 --> 01:45:15,742
burning through money and getting
increasingly drunk.

1370
01:45:15,742 --> 01:45:17,232
He can not drink water?

1371
01:45:18,679 --> 01:45:20,981
I like to hear it up
the stairs in the morning,

1372
01:45:20,981 --> 01:45:22,972
with the cups
beating tray.

1373
01:45:24,017 --> 01:45:28,317
And then he started making
their applications for eggs, toast and tea.

1374
01:45:29,122 --> 01:45:31,925
I think there
another man in the world

1375
01:45:31,925 --> 01:45:33,552
with the habits like his.

1376
01:45:35,262 --> 01:45:37,531
It's good that I do not kick,
or you can pull out all

1377
01:45:37,531 --> 01:45:38,657
my teeth!

1378
01:45:40,467 --> 01:45:43,368
Wait! It is the Church of Georgia!

1379
01:45:43,937 --> 01:45:48,533
That would be a good time
for him to come home!

1380
01:45:50,043 --> 01:45:52,979
First check your shirt.
Let's see if he still

1381
01:45:52,979 --> 01:45:55,882
have those French letters
who used the pocket.

1382
01:45:55,882 --> 01:45:58,785
He must think
I do not know!

1383
01:45:58,785 --> 01:46:00,309
Man a liar!

1384
01:46:00,620 --> 01:46:03,487
All 20 pockets are not
enough for their lies.

1385
01:46:04,057 --> 01:46:06,960
And why should we expect?
While it is true,

1386
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:08,188
they do not.

1387
01:46:09,129 --> 01:46:11,365
Do not enter almost anything
in their empty heads.

1388
01:46:11,365 --> 01:46:13,900
They need to be taken slowly
your own poison

1389
01:46:13,900 --> 01:46:18,462
with their eggs and tea
hot with butter and toast.

1390
01:46:18,805 --> 01:46:21,672
He also
is a terrible liar!

1391
01:46:22,242 --> 01:46:26,372
No, he did not have the courage
come out with a married woman!

1392
01:46:26,713 --> 01:46:29,383
For her, Denis, as he calls it,
got that look so unhappy,

1393
01:46:29,383 --> 01:46:32,045
what harm could
call him husband.

1394
01:46:32,819 --> 01:46:35,720
Yes
he's a bitch to him.

1395
01:46:37,724 --> 01:46:41,595
He says it's author and will be
university professor of Italian.

1396
01:46:41,595 --> 01:46:43,495
I wanted to have some lessons.

1397
01:46:43,830 --> 01:46:46,697
What does he plan now
showing him my photo?

1398
01:46:49,803 --> 01:46:52,339
I'm not good on her.
Still, I look young.

1399
01:46:52,339 --> 01:46:55,008
Does not he solved
make me a present,

1400
01:46:55,008 --> 01:46:57,203
yes, after all
and why not?

1401
01:46:59,780 --> 01:47:03,307
I was in mourning,
doing 11 years.

1402
01:47:03,817 --> 01:47:06,718
Yes
he would have 11 years.

1403
01:47:08,422 --> 01:47:13,026
While we need the grief,
not good to go.

1404
01:47:13,026 --> 01:47:17,019
He insisted
to mourn the cat.

1405
01:47:17,664 --> 01:47:20,934
I think now
he is a man.

1406
01:47:20,934 --> 01:47:24,335
He was an innocent boy
and a dear little boy.

1407
01:47:24,671 --> 01:47:27,574
He liked me too,
I remember.

1408
01:47:27,574 --> 01:47:28,939
Everyone likes.

1409
01:47:30,177 --> 01:47:32,372
Wait, my God!

1410
01:47:33,013 --> 01:47:35,382
Yes, wait
Yes, one moment!

1411
01:47:35,382 --> 01:47:37,282
He was on the cards in the morning,
I played the deck.

1412
01:47:38,351 --> 01:47:43,084
Union with young unknown,
no beautiful or ugly you already know.

1413
01:47:43,890 --> 01:47:47,294
I thought I could be him!
But he is not a brat

1414
01:47:47,294 --> 01:47:48,591
nor is unknown.

1415
01:47:49,996 --> 01:47:52,863
They all write about women
in his poetry,

1416
01:47:53,867 --> 01:47:56,734
and it is unlikely
to find many like me,

1417
01:47:57,437 --> 01:48:01,007
smooth with visions of love
and serenades,

1418
01:48:01,007 --> 01:48:02,599
where poetry is in the air.

1419
01:48:03,844 --> 01:48:05,744
Certainly he is very distinct,

1420
01:48:06,213 --> 01:48:08,148
I'd like to meet
a man with this,

1421
01:48:08,148 --> 01:48:10,851
God,
not as the wild I know.

1422
01:48:10,851 --> 01:48:12,018
Moreover, he is young!

1423
01:48:12,018 --> 01:48:16,790
A young guy who can
find dipping rocks

1424
01:48:16,790 --> 01:48:19,691
Margate Beach.
Sunbathing,

1425
01:48:19,793 --> 01:48:22,694
naked like gods or something,
and then playing in the sea with them.

1426
01:48:23,497 --> 01:48:25,298
Why do men
are not all like that?

1427
01:48:25,298 --> 01:48:27,323
Women have some consolation.

1428
01:48:28,268 --> 01:48:31,171
Like that little statue
he bought.

1429
01:48:31,171 --> 01:48:33,473
Could look at it
all day!

1430
01:48:33,473 --> 01:48:36,340
It exists
the real beauty and poetry!

1431
01:48:36,910 --> 01:48:39,777
I always feel
I want to kiss you all,

1432
01:48:40,180 --> 01:48:43,081
including her adorable
young cock, so simple.

1433
01:48:43,917 --> 01:48:45,852
I would not mind
put it in my mouth

1434
01:48:45,852 --> 01:48:47,487
nobody's watching.

1435
01:48:47,487 --> 01:48:49,723
It is as if he asked
suck it for you!

1436
01:48:49,723 --> 01:48:52,590
It looks so clean and clear
with his boyish face.

1437
01:48:53,159 --> 01:48:55,095
I would even
in a split second,

1438
01:48:55,095 --> 01:48:57,998
even something that came out of it,
would like a porridge,

1439
01:48:57,998 --> 01:49:00,865
or dew,
there is no danger.

1440
01:49:01,334 --> 01:49:04,905
He is so clean compared
pigs with those men,

1441
01:49:04,905 --> 01:49:09,035
I believe they never dreamed
Washing in a range of 1 year.

1442
01:49:10,577 --> 01:49:13,444
Can this be what gives
mustaches on women.

1443
01:49:14,314 --> 01:49:17,117
I just love it if I could
get involved with a beautiful

1444
01:49:17,117 --> 01:49:18,880
young poet
at my age.

1445
01:49:19,953 --> 01:49:21,755
I'll put the cards
early in the morning

1446
01:49:21,755 --> 01:49:23,990
and I will wait until
the letter you want appears,

1447
01:49:23,990 --> 01:49:26,927
or I'll read and study everything
what you can learn and remember,

1448
01:49:26,927 --> 01:49:29,863
if only I knew
what he likes,

1449
01:49:29,863 --> 01:49:32,730
he did not think I'm dumb
and that all women are equal.

1450
01:49:33,366 --> 01:49:35,425
I can teach you
on another subject,

1451
01:49:36,202 --> 01:49:39,729
I will make him feel all up
he almost fainted on me.

1452
01:49:39,940 --> 01:49:41,575
And then,
he can write

1453
01:49:41,575 --> 01:49:43,209
about his lover and mistress,
publicly

1454
01:49:43,209 --> 01:49:48,237
with all our photos
the papers when he becomes famous.

1455
01:49:48,715 --> 01:49:50,615
Ah, but then
What would I do with it?

1456
01:49:50,817 --> 01:49:52,752
Would not
to be a husband,

1457
01:49:52,752 --> 01:49:54,220
but you can not
deceive a lover!

1458
01:49:54,220 --> 01:49:56,022
No, it would be!

1459
01:49:56,022 --> 01:49:58,925
He has no manners,
is not refined

1460
01:49:58,925 --> 01:50:02,562
or anything of that nature,
slapping on my ass

1461
01:50:02,562 --> 01:50:05,465
that way,
because they called him Hugh.

1462
01:50:05,465 --> 01:50:08,366
The ignorant do not recognize
poetry as money.

1463
01:50:09,869 --> 01:50:12,806
This is what happens
not to keep it in place!

1464
01:50:12,806 --> 01:50:16,409
He rips the pants and shoes
and puts the chair before me,

1465
01:50:16,409 --> 01:50:18,812
with face-to-toe,
without even asking permission

1466
01:50:18,812 --> 01:50:22,549
and still maintains this vulgar way
with his shirt half open,

1467
01:50:22,549 --> 01:50:24,141
that use to be admired.

1468
01:50:25,051 --> 01:50:26,987
Of course he is right,
with his way of passing

1469
01:50:26,987 --> 01:50:29,889
time playing,
which is much better than being

1470
01:50:29,889 --> 01:50:32,790
in bed with what,
a lion?

1471
01:50:33,393 --> 01:50:37,693
God, I think he has
something better to say. A lion would have!

1472
01:50:38,465 --> 01:50:41,368
Oh, I think it's because they are
so plump and tempting

1473
01:50:41,368 --> 01:50:44,270
inside my jacket,
he could not resist!

1474
01:50:44,270 --> 01:50:47,137
They excite me, sometimes.

1475
01:50:47,707 --> 01:50:51,578
Men enjoy the pleasure
they feel when seeing the body

1476
01:50:51,578 --> 01:50:54,445
of a woman. We are so
round and clear for them.

1477
01:50:55,849 --> 01:50:58,716
Sometimes I wish I had
one from me for a change

1478
01:50:59,419 --> 01:51:03,256
to try to use that thing
they have and stick it in me,

1479
01:51:03,256 --> 01:51:06,123
so hard, and at the same time,
so soft when you touch.

1480
01:51:06,459 --> 01:51:07,824
Men, again!

1481
01:51:08,628 --> 01:51:11,531
They can pick and choose
whoever they want.

1482
01:51:11,531 --> 01:51:14,434
A married woman,
a grieving widow

1483
01:51:14,434 --> 01:51:16,770
or a girl
all with different flavors.

1484
01:51:16,770 --> 01:51:19,637
We're doomed
living chains,

1485
01:51:21,608 --> 01:51:24,509
but they will not
chain me right!

1486
01:51:25,111 --> 01:51:26,913
When I start,
I tell you,

1487
01:51:26,913 --> 01:51:29,416
that because of our husbands
stupid, we can not

1488
01:51:29,416 --> 01:51:33,785
remain friends instead
starting a fight?

1489
01:51:34,354 --> 01:51:38,188
Why we were given
all that desire?

1490
01:51:38,758 --> 01:51:41,386
Not my fault
if I am young, I?

1491
01:51:42,796 --> 01:51:46,032
It's a wonder I can not be
an old hag at my age!

1492
01:51:46,032 --> 01:51:48,935
Living with him so coldly,
you just hold me sometimes

1493
01:51:48,935 --> 01:51:50,300
when sleeping.

1494
01:51:50,670 --> 01:51:54,606
My order wrong,
he does not know who he is!

1495
01:51:55,542 --> 01:51:57,410
Any man who would kiss the ground
the woman steps,

1496
01:51:57,410 --> 01:51:59,002
I deserve to throw my hat!

1497
01:51:59,579 --> 01:52:01,648
Thereafter,
he can kiss whatever you want.

1498
01:52:01,648 --> 01:52:05,051
But we have not even
an atom of expression in us!

1499
01:52:05,051 --> 01:52:07,918
We are all one piece
lard,

1500
01:52:08,088 --> 01:52:10,113
but I would not
that with a man!

1501
01:52:11,691 --> 01:52:15,593
Gross dirty!
I do not want to think anymore!

1502
01:52:16,262 --> 01:52:19,165
I kissed his foot,
seorita!

1503
01:52:19,165 --> 01:52:21,568
This is a man
that nobody understands,

1504
01:52:21,568 --> 01:52:24,471
except me!

1505
01:52:24,471 --> 01:52:26,206
Still,
it is obvious that a woman likes

1506
01:52:26,206 --> 01:52:30,836
being embraced 20 times a day.
That makes her feel young!

1507
01:52:31,144 --> 01:52:33,947
No matter by whom,
but what matters is being

1508
01:52:33,947 --> 01:52:36,040
in love with someone.

1509
01:52:36,816 --> 01:52:42,388
If the person you want is not there ...
sometimes, God,

1510
01:52:42,388 --> 01:52:46,693
I thought about leaving by night
where nobody knows me,

1511
01:52:46,693 --> 01:52:50,096
and pick up a sailor from the sea,
deranged,

1512
01:52:50,096 --> 01:52:52,999
not caring who
I was, but only for

1513
01:52:52,999 --> 01:52:55,201
make love
without thinking about anything.

1514
01:52:55,201 --> 01:52:57,170
It could be also
one of those gypsies

1515
01:52:57,170 --> 01:52:58,538
traveling there.

1516
01:52:58,538 --> 01:53:01,474
One of these subjects
with beautiful eyes and

1517
01:53:01,474 --> 01:53:03,810
face boor,
attacking me in the dark

1518
01:53:03,810 --> 01:53:06,713
against the wall,
without saying a word.

1519
01:53:06,713 --> 01:53:09,580
Or a murderer,
anyone!

1520
01:53:11,184 --> 01:53:15,348
It is a pity that the sailors
are rotting with disease!

1521
01:53:16,489 --> 01:53:20,391
Ah, take this huge walk away,
for God's sake!

1522
01:53:22,128 --> 01:53:23,152
Listen!

1523
01:53:25,265 --> 01:53:28,201
The winds that blow
my pities away,

1524
01:53:28,201 --> 01:53:31,137
so that it can
sleep and regret,

1525
01:53:31,137 --> 01:53:36,006
the great tipster
Don Poldy La Flora,

1526
01:53:36,943 --> 01:53:39,846
and I must drag myself to the
kitchen to prepare your

1527
01:53:39,846 --> 01:53:42,248
coffee authority,
while it is rolled

1528
01:53:42,248 --> 01:53:43,715
as a mom.

1529
01:53:44,217 --> 01:53:47,948
I will do the same,
have you seen me run?

1530
01:53:48,154 --> 01:53:49,746
I'd like to see me!

1531
01:53:50,590 --> 01:53:52,888
Demonstrate attention
and treat her like dirt!

1532
01:53:53,393 --> 01:53:56,329
I do not care what
others say, but it would be

1533
01:53:56,329 --> 01:53:59,899
much better for the world
if women were ruling,

1534
01:53:59,899 --> 01:54:02,802
because we would not see women killing
and slaughtering each other.

1535
01:54:02,802 --> 01:54:04,838
Well,
is a sad case to those

1536
01:54:04,838 --> 01:54:06,739
they have a beautiful son,
like that

1537
01:54:06,739 --> 01:54:08,297
and are not happy.

1538
01:54:09,976 --> 01:54:11,170
I'm not!

1539
01:54:12,545 --> 01:54:14,638
He failed to make one?

1540
01:54:15,014 --> 01:54:16,311
Not my fault!

1541
01:54:17,684 --> 01:54:20,153
We were happy together
as I saw the two dogs

1542
01:54:20,153 --> 01:54:23,884
doing it that way,
in the middle of the deserted street.

1543
01:54:24,657 --> 01:54:27,524
This left me completely
heartbroken!

1544
01:54:28,895 --> 01:54:31,798
I think I should not have it
buried with that jacket

1545
01:54:31,798 --> 01:54:33,900
I knitted woolly,
I was like crying!

1546
01:54:33,900 --> 01:54:35,959
It should have given
some poor child.

1547
01:54:36,302 --> 01:54:38,395
But I knew well,
I would never have another.

1548
01:54:38,872 --> 01:54:40,897
It was our first death too!

1549
01:54:41,374 --> 01:54:43,239
Never been the same.

1550
01:54:44,544 --> 01:54:48,674
Oh, I will not start to come into
depression, talking about it again!

1551
01:54:49,883 --> 01:54:52,151
I wanted to understand why
he spent the night here

1552
01:54:52,151 --> 01:54:54,454
ruining your life forever

1553
01:54:54,454 --> 01:54:55,045
maybe.

1554
01:54:55,521 --> 01:54:57,457
Still,
would be great!

1555
01:54:57,457 --> 01:54:58,788
So quiet!

1556
01:55:00,760 --> 01:55:03,663
Wanted to tell him
many nonsense, serving it well,

1557
01:55:03,663 --> 01:55:06,566
thought to be his fault
the fact that I was an adulteress.

1558
01:55:06,566 --> 01:55:08,534
Oh, big deal
if this is all evil

1559
01:55:08,534 --> 01:55:11,401
we did
in this valley of tears.

1560
01:55:12,038 --> 01:55:13,699
God knows
it is nothing!

1561
01:55:14,173 --> 01:55:15,970
Everyone does,
but they hide.

1562
01:55:16,876 --> 01:55:20,713
I think a woman is good for this,
He not only would have made us

1563
01:55:20,713 --> 01:55:23,011
this way,
so attractive to men.

1564
01:55:23,950 --> 01:55:26,077
They often say
God does not exist.

1565
01:55:26,786 --> 01:55:29,653
I'd give anything
what they learn.

1566
01:55:30,256 --> 01:55:32,659
Why not try to create something?

1567
01:55:32,659 --> 01:55:35,561
Then the priest will cry,
because they are dying,

1568
01:55:35,561 --> 01:55:36,696
and why?

1569
01:55:36,696 --> 01:55:40,233
Because they are afraid of hell,
with their consciences.

1570
01:55:40,233 --> 01:55:42,167
Ah, yes
I know them well!

1571
01:55:44,270 --> 01:55:48,875
Who was the first person in the universe,
first of all, who created everything?

1572
01:55:48,875 --> 01:55:51,742
Who?
Hmm .. that they do not know!

1573
01:55:52,478 --> 01:55:55,381
Neither do I, so
here we are.

1574
01:55:55,381 --> 01:55:59,112
He can try to make the sun
not be born tomorrow.

1575
01:55:59,819 --> 01:56:02,686
The sun rises for you,
he said, the day we were

1576
01:56:02,822 --> 01:56:06,726
lying on the grass in Howthhead,
with his gray suit

1577
01:56:06,726 --> 01:56:10,163
and his straw hat the day
he asked me to marry.

1578
01:56:10,163 --> 01:56:10,993
Yes

1579
01:56:11,864 --> 01:56:14,424
First,
I gave him the cake of my mouth

1580
01:56:15,001 --> 01:56:17,904
and it was leap year,
as now, yes ...

1581
01:56:17,904 --> 01:56:19,667
16 years ago.

1582
01:56:20,139 --> 01:56:23,042
My God,
after that long kiss,

1583
01:56:23,042 --> 01:56:25,010
I almost lost my breath!

1584
01:56:25,645 --> 01:56:29,706
Yes
we are like flowers.

1585
01:56:30,116 --> 01:56:33,017
The body of a woman
yes.

1586
01:56:33,720 --> 01:56:36,587
That was the only thing
true that he ever said:

1587
01:56:36,656 --> 01:56:40,893
"The sun rises for you today."
Yes!

1588
01:56:40,893 --> 01:56:43,096
So I liked him,
because he knew

1589
01:56:43,096 --> 01:56:45,298
or felt,
as was a woman.

1590
01:56:45,298 --> 01:56:47,500
I knew I could always
be by your side,

1591
01:56:47,500 --> 01:56:49,400
giving all the pleasure
I could.

1592
01:56:49,736 --> 01:56:52,672
I could guide you to
they asked me to say yes!

1593
01:56:52,672 --> 01:56:57,268
I do not respond promptly,
just look to the sea and the sky.

1594
01:56:57,777 --> 01:57:00,644
Ah,
the terrible flood depth;

1595
01:57:01,347 --> 01:57:04,917
crimson sea,
like fire;

1596
01:57:04,917 --> 01:57:09,188
the glorious sunsets as the sun;
fig trees in the gardens mall, yes!

1597
01:57:09,188 --> 01:57:12,091
All alleys strange
roses and boxes, blue and yellow.

1598
01:57:12,091 --> 01:57:16,195
The roses and jasmine,
geraniums, cacti and Gibraltar,

1599
01:57:16,195 --> 01:57:20,066
as a girl where I was
a mountain flower, yeah!

1600
01:57:20,066 --> 01:57:23,736
When you put a rose in her hair,
like the Andalusian girls

1601
01:57:23,736 --> 01:57:26,005
used to do,
red or should be, yes!

1602
01:57:26,005 --> 01:57:28,872
And as he kissed me near
the Moorish wall,

1603
01:57:29,342 --> 01:57:31,811
and I thought he was
Best of all,

1604
01:57:31,811 --> 01:57:34,180
and then asked with eyes
I asked for

1605
01:57:34,180 --> 01:57:37,047
to marry again, "You
I would like ...", and he asked,

1606
01:57:37,216 --> 01:57:40,617
yes, say yes,
my mountain flower.

1607
01:57:41,087 --> 01:57:43,122
First, I put my
arms around him,

1608
01:57:43,122 --> 01:57:46,059
yes, and then pulled it
in my direction so that

1609
01:57:46,059 --> 01:57:51,230
feel the scent on my breasts,
yes and his heart was deranged,

1610
01:57:51,230 --> 01:57:55,223
and yes,
I said yes I do, yes!
