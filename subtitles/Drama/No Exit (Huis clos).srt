1
00:00:03,865 --> 00:00:06,356
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

2
00:00:06,493 --> 00:00:10,705
<i>... it's a pleasure for me to be here</i>
<i>on such a beautiful day...</i>

3
00:00:10,914 --> 00:00:13,666
<i>... in the great city of Detroit.</i>

4
00:00:14,877 --> 00:00:17,546
<i>And I'd love to tell you all...</i>

5
00:00:17,755 --> 00:00:21,254
<i>... to sit back, relax and enjoy yourselves.</i>

6
00:00:21,842 --> 00:00:23,716
<i>I'd love to...</i>

7
00:00:23,886 --> 00:00:27,006
<i>... but unfortunately, I can't do that.</i>

8
00:00:27,515 --> 00:00:32,058
<i>There's a very serious issue spiraling</i>
<i>out of control in this country.</i>

9
00:00:32,228 --> 00:00:35,644
<i>Illegal handguns ending up</i>
<i>in the hands of our children.</i>

10
00:00:38,944 --> 00:00:43,736
<i>Instead of reading off statistics</i>
<i>that you might not already know...</i>

11
00:00:43,949 --> 00:00:49,026
<i>... that last year, more preschoolers died</i>
<i>from guns than police officers...</i>

12
00:00:49,246 --> 00:00:52,746
<i>... or that gunshot wounds</i>
<i>are the second leading cause of death...</i>

13
00:00:52,917 --> 00:00:55,325
<i>... for all people in the U.S., ages 10 to 34.</i>

14
00:00:58,214 --> 00:01:00,788
Hold it. Go on in.

15
00:01:22,114 --> 00:01:26,611
<i>While he lay bleeding to death</i>
<i>for 40 minutes, waiting for help to come.</i>

16
00:01:27,912 --> 00:01:30,320
<i>Darren was 16 years old.</i>

17
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:33,744
<i>That could've been any one</i>
<i>of your children.</i>

18
00:01:34,711 --> 00:01:38,661
<i>I hope you'll consider my four-year plan</i>
<i>to get guns off the streets.</i>

19
00:01:39,758 --> 00:01:41,834
<i>I need your help and your support.</i>

20
00:01:42,511 --> 00:01:46,723
<i>Let's stop the pain and suffering</i>
<i>Darren's family had to go through.</i>

21
00:01:46,807 --> 00:01:48,634
<i>God bless you and thank you.</i>

22
00:01:51,854 --> 00:01:55,769
- He just loves pissing me off.
- I'm sure he has his reasons.

23
00:02:03,825 --> 00:02:05,284
Thanks a lot.

24
00:02:06,995 --> 00:02:08,323
Thank you.

25
00:02:13,669 --> 00:02:14,618
Relax.

26
00:02:14,962 --> 00:02:16,207
I'll talk to him.

27
00:02:16,463 --> 00:02:18,006
Thank you, everybody.

28
00:02:18,215 --> 00:02:20,837
How are you? Good to see you.

29
00:02:21,802 --> 00:02:23,594
Mr. Vice President, sir?

30
00:03:08,727 --> 00:03:10,720
Bobby, what the hell is this?

31
00:03:11,605 --> 00:03:12,980
You believe this guy?

32
00:03:29,582 --> 00:03:32,369
Sorry, the bridge is closed
until the V.P. gets across.

33
00:03:32,585 --> 00:03:34,958
You can't stay here.
You have to move it out.

34
00:03:46,558 --> 00:03:47,934
- Shit!
- Get down, sir!

35
00:03:48,143 --> 00:03:49,424
Get us out of here!

36
00:03:57,069 --> 00:03:58,101
Excuse me.

37
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,242
<i>Officers need help!</i>
<i>On the bridge! Shots fired!</i>

38
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:07,953
<i>Warn the D.P., they are dressed as cops!</i>
<i>Repeat: They are dressed as cops!</i>

39
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,781
<i>Alpha six to Bravo Air, keep cover...</i>

40
00:04:16,382 --> 00:04:18,458
- Stay down!
- What the hell is going on?

41
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,762
<i>No cops on the bridge.</i>
<i>We can't tell who's who.</i>

42
00:04:22,972 --> 00:04:25,890
<i>No Detroit P.D., Secret Service only.</i>

43
00:04:27,977 --> 00:04:30,349
Officers need help.
Motorcade's under attack!

44
00:04:30,438 --> 00:04:33,143
<i>All units, stay off the bridge,</i>
<i>as per Secret Service.</i>

45
00:04:43,243 --> 00:04:44,868
<i>All units stay off bridge...</i>

46
00:04:44,953 --> 00:04:47,195
Goddamn it, I told you to clear the bridge!

47
00:04:47,456 --> 00:04:49,164
Bring the truck in!

48
00:04:54,046 --> 00:04:56,335
Goddamn it! Secret Service only!

49
00:04:56,549 --> 00:04:57,877
Who the hell is that?

50
00:05:11,481 --> 00:05:12,477
Get me out!

51
00:05:18,739 --> 00:05:20,317
- Get me out of here!
- Get in.

52
00:05:20,533 --> 00:05:22,609
Who the hell are you? Off the bridge.

53
00:05:22,702 --> 00:05:25,074
We're not moving till the transport arrives.

54
00:05:25,162 --> 00:05:27,914
I'm not talking to you!
Mr. Vice President, get in here!

55
00:05:30,585 --> 00:05:32,459
We need help here now!

56
00:05:34,214 --> 00:05:36,290
<i>Alpha one to Alpha six.</i>

57
00:05:38,844 --> 00:05:41,382
Move it out! Everything's under control!

58
00:05:42,222 --> 00:05:42,969
Jesus!

59
00:05:43,182 --> 00:05:44,676
<i>Take out the Alpha vehicle!</i>

60
00:06:37,739 --> 00:06:39,946
I'm sorry, sir. I got to do this.

61
00:06:40,117 --> 00:06:43,118
Shit! I can't swim.

62
00:06:54,298 --> 00:06:55,674
Don't move!

63
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,303
Freeze!

64
00:07:03,516 --> 00:07:05,141
It's okay. I'm on the job.

65
00:07:11,775 --> 00:07:13,150
We got you, sir.

66
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,234
You're going to be all right, sir.

67
00:07:20,326 --> 00:07:23,410
Why did you drive onto that bridge
and start World War III?

68
00:07:23,621 --> 00:07:26,290
- I saved his life, Frank.
- You were lucky, Orin.

69
00:07:26,374 --> 00:07:27,536
Extremely lucky.

70
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:31,041
The Secret Service gave a direct order
not to storm that bridge!

71
00:07:31,296 --> 00:07:33,869
They were responsible for him. Not you!

72
00:07:34,257 --> 00:07:37,044
- What if it went the other way?
- I didn't vote for him.

73
00:07:37,135 --> 00:07:38,629
This is funny to you?

74
00:07:38,845 --> 00:07:40,803
- What's funny to me is...
- Cut it out.

75
00:07:42,724 --> 00:07:43,804
Who were they?

76
00:07:44,476 --> 00:07:46,184
Some Michigan militant group.

77
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,596
- Live by the sword, man.
- Sit down.

78
00:07:55,488 --> 00:07:58,240
Look, Orin.
We've known each other a long time.

79
00:07:58,992 --> 00:08:00,984
I am your friend, but also your boss.

80
00:08:01,202 --> 00:08:04,821
As your friend, you don't follow orders.
You're unmanageable.

81
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,531
You don't obey the law
or think before you act.

82
00:08:07,751 --> 00:08:10,918
And now, as your boss, you're fired.

83
00:08:11,171 --> 00:08:13,294
- Just like that.
- Hinges wants you out.

84
00:08:13,507 --> 00:08:15,001
There's nothing I can do.

85
00:08:15,259 --> 00:08:17,666
You want to talk to him yourself,
be my guest.

86
00:08:17,761 --> 00:08:19,172
<i>Now handle it!</i>

87
00:08:26,604 --> 00:08:29,012
You are like a cockroach, Mr. Boyd.

88
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:32,642
Every time I try to get rid of you,
you appeal to the union...

89
00:08:32,735 --> 00:08:35,191
...and they send your ass right back here.

90
00:08:35,697 --> 00:08:36,895
But not this time.

91
00:08:37,616 --> 00:08:41,448
I've been talking to the Secret Service
figuring out what to do with you.

92
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,947
They want you to suffer, Mr. Boyd.

93
00:08:44,373 --> 00:08:47,540
They want you to suffer bad
for that stupid stunt you pulled.

94
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:51,627
And I must say, I do not disagree.

95
00:08:52,423 --> 00:08:54,001
You guys are unbelievable.

96
00:08:54,216 --> 00:08:56,790
I saw a problem, I fixed it. Simple as that.

97
00:08:57,053 --> 00:08:58,927
That's bullshit, Mr. Boyd.

98
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:01,214
Because of cops like you...

99
00:09:01,891 --> 00:09:03,967
...police have a bad image everywhere.

100
00:09:04,394 --> 00:09:07,514
You won't pin that on me.
I stick my neck out every day.

101
00:09:07,731 --> 00:09:11,396
You remind me of bureaucrats in the '60s
sending kids to fight in Vietnam.

102
00:09:11,568 --> 00:09:13,691
I'm not going to send you to Vietnam.

103
00:09:13,779 --> 00:09:16,733
- I'm going to send you to the 15th.
- That shithole.

104
00:09:16,824 --> 00:09:18,484
You'll fit right in.

105
00:09:34,843 --> 00:09:35,922
Come on, get up.

106
00:09:37,178 --> 00:09:39,052
I know my rights, man.

107
00:09:40,932 --> 00:09:42,131
Knock off the shit!

108
00:09:42,726 --> 00:09:43,889
Understand?

109
00:09:45,145 --> 00:09:46,640
Can I help you?

110
00:09:46,855 --> 00:09:49,181
I'm looking for the ringleader of this circus.

111
00:09:49,692 --> 00:09:51,850
Yes, sir. And you are?

112
00:09:51,944 --> 00:09:55,278
- Boyd. The commander's expecting me.
- Follow me.

113
00:09:56,365 --> 00:09:58,323
Commander's got a grip on things.

114
00:09:58,534 --> 00:10:00,860
I've seen mental wards
saner than this place.

115
00:10:25,229 --> 00:10:26,427
Can we start over?

116
00:10:26,981 --> 00:10:29,816
Too late for first impressions. Sit.

117
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:41,197
This year alone, three complaints
filed against you for excessive force.

118
00:10:41,371 --> 00:10:43,660
This doesn't seem like a hero's welcome.

119
00:10:43,749 --> 00:10:46,454
You want to be welcomed?
Stay out of the headlines.

120
00:10:46,543 --> 00:10:49,035
Around here,
there's no such thing as heroes.

121
00:10:49,129 --> 00:10:52,914
I've got community activists swearing
we treat everybody like criminals...

122
00:10:53,009 --> 00:10:55,547
...and criminals all swearing
they're altar boys.

123
00:10:55,636 --> 00:10:58,721
Maybe I was never an altar boy,
but the point is...

124
00:10:58,973 --> 00:11:02,342
The point is,
cops don't uphold the law by breaking it.

125
00:11:03,478 --> 00:11:06,265
Now, you got a problem in my house,
you come see me.

126
00:11:06,439 --> 00:11:09,394
None of this Lone Ranger stuff
that I keep hearing about.

127
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,819
Are you listening?

128
00:11:11,903 --> 00:11:14,655
If I have a problem,
I'll come and see the commander.

129
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:18,405
All that stuff with the Vice President?
A little water never hurt anybody.

130
00:11:18,494 --> 00:11:22,112
But I am worried
about your discipline problem.

131
00:11:22,456 --> 00:11:24,782
I was thinking about putting you on a desk.

132
00:11:25,167 --> 00:11:27,741
- I can't type.
- I have a better idea.

133
00:11:28,713 --> 00:11:32,164
Something that will broaden your horizons.

134
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,541
And then her dog.

135
00:11:37,514 --> 00:11:40,087
Her dog gets so freaked out...

136
00:11:40,517 --> 00:11:43,969
...he takes this enormous shit...

137
00:11:44,188 --> 00:11:46,595
...right in the middle of the living room.

138
00:11:49,944 --> 00:11:52,435
I chased that little bastard everywhere...

139
00:11:52,947 --> 00:11:54,774
...until I finally cornered him.

140
00:11:54,865 --> 00:11:57,404
I warned her not to buy a frigging poodle.

141
00:11:57,618 --> 00:12:00,785
I never could have thrown
a German Shepherd out the window.

142
00:12:05,085 --> 00:12:06,283
Okay.

143
00:12:14,803 --> 00:12:16,214
That's it. Let it out.

144
00:12:16,305 --> 00:12:18,878
Okay? That's why we're here.

145
00:12:19,099 --> 00:12:22,800
To talk through our problems,
not to let it bottle up.

146
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,051
Okay.

147
00:12:24,647 --> 00:12:27,814
And the rest of you,
I want you to dig down deep...

148
00:12:28,067 --> 00:12:30,439
...and ask yourself the question:

149
00:12:31,321 --> 00:12:34,856
Why are we mad and what are we mad at?

150
00:12:36,368 --> 00:12:37,826
Good. Okay.

151
00:12:39,496 --> 00:12:41,239
Who'd like to go next?

152
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:43,995
Hey, everyone.

153
00:12:44,084 --> 00:12:45,033
How are you?

154
00:12:45,127 --> 00:12:49,125
For those of you just tuning in, my name
is Henry Wayne, and I'm a rageaholic.

155
00:12:49,215 --> 00:12:52,299
You probably all recognize me
from my show, <i>Detroit A.M.</i>

156
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:57,424
You're probably wondering
what happened to my head here.

157
00:12:57,515 --> 00:13:00,718
I know it's always something,
and I shouldn't lose my cool.

158
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:03,266
I was at Krispy Kreme,
picking up a twelve-pack.

159
00:13:03,354 --> 00:13:04,897
- And this guy...
- Okay.

160
00:13:05,106 --> 00:13:07,811
I'm so sorry to interrupt you but...

161
00:13:08,777 --> 00:13:11,019
...I'm kind of looking for a fresh face next.

162
00:13:11,113 --> 00:13:12,275
I've been sitting there...

163
00:13:12,364 --> 00:13:13,775
We'll get back to you.

164
00:13:13,866 --> 00:13:16,783
I'm a ticking time bomb,
and I'm ready to implode.

165
00:13:16,869 --> 00:13:18,363
Let's solve my problem.

166
00:13:18,787 --> 00:13:19,736
Sit down!

167
00:13:24,335 --> 00:13:25,331
Okay.

168
00:13:26,796 --> 00:13:28,670
So, who's it going to be?

169
00:13:31,384 --> 00:13:35,133
Mr. Boyd?
I believe that you were sent to us...

170
00:13:35,221 --> 00:13:37,677
...because of work-related stress...

171
00:13:37,891 --> 00:13:40,133
...aggression towards authority figures...

172
00:13:40,394 --> 00:13:43,395
...and an all-around lack of discipline.

173
00:13:43,564 --> 00:13:47,562
I'm fine. You can move on.
Other people want to say something.

174
00:13:47,735 --> 00:13:52,361
Mr. Boyd, denial is a classic symptom
of unhealthy rage.

175
00:13:52,573 --> 00:13:55,610
Okay? So why don't you just stand up...

176
00:13:55,826 --> 00:13:58,744
...and tell us a little bit about yourself.

177
00:14:16,515 --> 00:14:19,089
I'd like to make this clear:
I don't have rage.

178
00:14:19,602 --> 00:14:21,678
I'm a happy guy. You see this face?

179
00:14:22,605 --> 00:14:24,763
This is a happy face. You all...

180
00:14:25,107 --> 00:14:27,943
...would be lucky to be as happy as I am.

181
00:14:48,757 --> 00:14:50,797
What am I, a shit magnet?

182
00:14:55,973 --> 00:14:57,800
Junior, having a tough time?

183
00:14:57,892 --> 00:15:00,893
You got to get in and out quick.
I'm an expert at this.

184
00:15:00,979 --> 00:15:02,888
I could do that in a blink of an eye.

185
00:15:02,981 --> 00:15:05,519
- Why don't you show us?
- Watch.

186
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:09,148
- Just like that. See?
- You a magician?

187
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,482
You want me to show you
how to pull a rabbit out of your ass?

188
00:15:13,784 --> 00:15:16,192
Screw Linda. Come on back in.

189
00:15:16,286 --> 00:15:18,694
Everybody's tearing
the tops off their desks.

190
00:15:18,914 --> 00:15:20,408
Who the hell are you?

191
00:15:20,499 --> 00:15:22,539
Henry Wayne<i>. Detroit A.M.</i>

192
00:15:23,169 --> 00:15:25,161
- This a friend of yours?
- Yeah.

193
00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:28,084
- Go back to class.
- They're gonna kill me without you.

194
00:15:28,174 --> 00:15:31,341
If you stay here, they might kill you, too,
so go back to class.

195
00:15:34,055 --> 00:15:35,964
Jeez! Well, no! Well, shit!

196
00:15:36,182 --> 00:15:37,974
I don't even know this guy.

197
00:15:38,477 --> 00:15:42,177
Stay out of our class.
We got people in there with real problems.

198
00:15:42,606 --> 00:15:45,940
FYI, next week
I'm doing a show on violent twins.

199
00:15:46,026 --> 00:15:48,268
- Enough of this bullshit!
- You're not twins?

200
00:15:48,487 --> 00:15:49,768
Take the man's keys.

201
00:15:49,864 --> 00:15:51,144
Give me your keys.

202
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:25,394
Stop it! Mr. Boyd, stop hitting that man!

203
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:32,528
Mr. Boyd! What're you doing?
This is no way to deal with your anger.

204
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:36,200
Screw that, man! You kill
those bastards! They tried to pop us!

205
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:39,540
Did you guys see that?
Can you believe this shit?

206
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:43,874
Boyd is such a bad-ass. He could easily
win a tough-men competition.

207
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:47,166
You guys just missed it,
but I'm glad I got here when I did.

208
00:16:47,383 --> 00:16:50,834
Boyd's a cop! He's a cop!
He gets to do this shit all the time!

209
00:16:51,053 --> 00:16:53,378
We're going to have
great stories for group!

210
00:16:56,809 --> 00:16:58,718
You see how happy I make others?

211
00:17:03,024 --> 00:17:04,222
Hey, Boyd.

212
00:17:06,152 --> 00:17:07,730
Good job, man.

213
00:17:10,866 --> 00:17:12,277
We'll see you next week?

214
00:17:15,078 --> 00:17:17,118
Come on, guys! That was great!

215
00:17:17,331 --> 00:17:19,537
Now, was that cool, or what? Come on!

216
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,662
Who are you here to see?

217
00:17:55,872 --> 00:17:56,986
Shaun Rollins.

218
00:17:57,457 --> 00:17:59,330
- And you are?
- A friend.

219
00:18:00,043 --> 00:18:01,620
Photo I.D.

220
00:18:05,507 --> 00:18:06,787
Sign in.

221
00:18:10,429 --> 00:18:12,006
Back to the left.

222
00:18:31,075 --> 00:18:32,273
How you holding up?

223
00:18:33,244 --> 00:18:34,489
Not too well, man.

224
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:37,031
Straight losing it, dog.

225
00:18:37,207 --> 00:18:39,532
I can only take so much of this shit.

226
00:18:39,709 --> 00:18:43,043
- What's up with my lawyer?
- I talked to him.

227
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:45,461
Slow motion. You know, the system.

228
00:18:45,674 --> 00:18:47,252
No, I don't know, man.

229
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:50,252
I need to know
how much time I'm looking at.

230
00:18:50,346 --> 00:18:52,338
Nobody's telling me nothing.

231
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:56,179
I don't know.

232
00:18:59,022 --> 00:19:00,397
Fuck, man.

233
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,684
This shit is bullshit.

234
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:05,566
Fuck do you mean, you don't know?

235
00:19:06,363 --> 00:19:09,364
You got to see the Jeffrey Dahmer
look-alikes in here, man.

236
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:11,074
It's crazy.

237
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:15,195
It's like I can't even turn my back
to take a piss up in here, man.

238
00:19:18,626 --> 00:19:19,621
Shaun.

239
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,793
You got to stay focused.

240
00:19:29,637 --> 00:19:32,841
Do whatever you got to do
to make sure that you safe in there.

241
00:19:35,143 --> 00:19:37,183
I got everything on the street covered.

242
00:19:38,271 --> 00:19:39,979
Nobody's forgotten about you.

243
00:19:43,443 --> 00:19:44,772
Nobody.

244
00:20:16,603 --> 00:20:18,513
Don't worry. I've got them.

245
00:20:18,731 --> 00:20:21,851
They're my people,
and if they're not buying, they're walking.

246
00:20:26,364 --> 00:20:29,815
This is what I'm talking about.

247
00:20:32,203 --> 00:20:33,199
Nice color.

248
00:20:34,497 --> 00:20:35,660
If you Puffy.

249
00:20:37,751 --> 00:20:40,289
- Shit!
- Good afternoon, homies.

250
00:20:40,379 --> 00:20:44,507
I'm Alan Morris, and if there's anything
I could help you with, I'm your dog.

251
00:20:44,591 --> 00:20:47,628
Get the fuck out of here, man.
Is that the new 993 Turbo?

252
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,721
Actually, that's the 993 Carrera.

253
00:20:50,806 --> 00:20:55,350
Shit! It got 8 cylinders?
They kick out 600 horsepower, right?

254
00:20:55,561 --> 00:20:58,847
That's 6 cylinders, 475 horsepower.

255
00:20:59,273 --> 00:21:00,388
Whatever.

256
00:21:00,483 --> 00:21:02,725
Would you mind not leaning on the...

257
00:21:02,819 --> 00:21:06,069
Shit! I could get some ass
from the twins in this, dog.

258
00:21:06,197 --> 00:21:08,024
Hello, Mrs. Johnson. How are you?

259
00:21:08,992 --> 00:21:09,988
Hell, yeah.

260
00:21:11,495 --> 00:21:12,989
Mrs. Johnson got a fat ass.

261
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,829
I got something for you, Mrs. Johnson.

262
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:19,616
You're not allowed to play any music here.

263
00:21:19,712 --> 00:21:21,420
Could you turn it off, please?

264
00:21:21,922 --> 00:21:24,045
Could you turn the music off, please?

265
00:21:24,926 --> 00:21:27,761
Turn the music off, please, brother.

266
00:21:27,845 --> 00:21:30,052
Look, can you turn the music off, please!

267
00:21:35,395 --> 00:21:38,479
Can you not hear me?
Could you turn the music down, please?

268
00:21:42,527 --> 00:21:44,604
Yeah! Hit it!

269
00:21:45,113 --> 00:21:46,193
It is not a toy.

270
00:21:46,407 --> 00:21:48,530
Mrs. Johnson was shaking her ass.

271
00:21:49,243 --> 00:21:51,948
Mrs. Johnson!
Shake your ass, baby. Shake it!

272
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:53,110
Mrs. Johnson.

273
00:21:53,956 --> 00:21:56,364
You think I could hit some corners in this?

274
00:21:56,459 --> 00:21:57,918
Take it on a test drive.

275
00:21:58,002 --> 00:22:00,754
I'm sorry. Our policy is no test drives.

276
00:22:00,964 --> 00:22:02,921
How about hooking a brother up then?

277
00:22:03,007 --> 00:22:04,632
Hooking a brother up.

278
00:22:04,801 --> 00:22:08,217
The cheapest car we have here is $75,000.

279
00:22:08,638 --> 00:22:09,634
That it?

280
00:22:10,056 --> 00:22:12,464
- It got a lot of head room. Get it?
- Yo, bro.

281
00:22:13,894 --> 00:22:15,269
This is it.

282
00:22:15,521 --> 00:22:17,312
Oh, yeah.

283
00:22:18,107 --> 00:22:20,146
See? My man got taste.

284
00:22:20,317 --> 00:22:22,144
Yes, well, he's got something.

285
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:23,768
Shit!

286
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,605
- You like it?
- Yo, dog, this shit is hot, man.

287
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:29,241
How much? $200,000?

288
00:22:29,452 --> 00:22:31,112
Actually, $285,000.

289
00:22:31,996 --> 00:22:34,534
It better suck and fuck me
for $285,000, man.

290
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:38,251
Actually, there are only seven of these
for sale in the U.S.

291
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,534
That many.

292
00:22:40,547 --> 00:22:44,130
Pop the hood, man.
I want to see what $285,000 look like.

293
00:22:44,343 --> 00:22:45,671
That's the hood.

294
00:22:45,886 --> 00:22:47,677
That's the trunk.

295
00:22:50,391 --> 00:22:51,387
That's okay.

296
00:22:52,059 --> 00:22:53,435
Yo, start it up, dog.

297
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:57,434
No, I'm sorry.
It's our policy. You can't start up the car.

298
00:22:57,523 --> 00:22:59,018
It's policy. Sorry.

299
00:22:59,859 --> 00:23:01,057
What in the...

300
00:23:03,446 --> 00:23:04,644
Hey, you!

301
00:23:04,989 --> 00:23:06,698
Turn off the engine!

302
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,616
- Would you turn off the engine, please?
- Yeah, yeah!

303
00:23:11,663 --> 00:23:15,115
Could you turn off
the motherfucking engine?

304
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:18,204
You don't have to yell.

305
00:23:18,379 --> 00:23:21,296
All you had to do was ask.
You'd get much better results.

306
00:23:21,507 --> 00:23:24,045
- Will you please just leave?
- No.

307
00:23:25,219 --> 00:23:26,713
I want this.

308
00:23:27,805 --> 00:23:31,637
Unless you decide you'd like to live in this,
I suggest that you...

309
00:23:31,726 --> 00:23:35,060
I suggest you get started
on the paperwork.

310
00:23:36,564 --> 00:23:38,059
What do these people think?

311
00:23:40,026 --> 00:23:41,022
Oh, my God.

312
00:23:42,321 --> 00:23:43,779
There's $300,000 in there.

313
00:23:43,864 --> 00:23:45,773
Make sure he gets the commission.

314
00:23:45,866 --> 00:23:46,862
He get...

315
00:23:48,744 --> 00:23:49,859
Keep the change.

316
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:52,574
Maybe I made a mistake.

317
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:53,905
You know?

318
00:23:54,125 --> 00:23:57,909
We're both homies.
All of us here. Why don't you...

319
00:24:01,257 --> 00:24:04,673
Homies! I'm your man!

320
00:24:07,264 --> 00:24:10,383
Faster, dog! Yeah! Faster!

321
00:24:12,477 --> 00:24:13,722
Okay, dog, go right.

322
00:24:13,937 --> 00:24:17,141
Sit down, man.
Can't afford to get pulled over.

323
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:19,858
We got a big night tonight.

324
00:24:55,231 --> 00:24:56,974
Doesn't anybody sleep anymore?

325
00:25:01,404 --> 00:25:05,616
Yeah. Bring you the goods, baby.

326
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,614
Hey!

327
00:25:06,701 --> 00:25:09,027
- What are you looking at?
- Oh, shit, man!

328
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,905
You always walk up on somebody
like that? Could've given me a coronary.

329
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,458
You mind if I take a look?

330
00:25:16,754 --> 00:25:18,960
- Bird watching?
- No, man.

331
00:25:19,048 --> 00:25:21,883
Just checking on my old lady.
Keeping tabs on her.

332
00:25:21,967 --> 00:25:23,841
Women. You can't trust them.

333
00:25:24,011 --> 00:25:27,630
Not as far as I can throw her ass.
And she a big bitch.

334
00:25:29,308 --> 00:25:31,266
I don't see anything. Where is she?

335
00:25:31,895 --> 00:25:33,721
Up in the corner over there, man.

336
00:25:33,813 --> 00:25:34,976
No luck.

337
00:25:35,065 --> 00:25:37,769
I think maybe you should
go home and call her tomorrow.

338
00:25:37,859 --> 00:25:39,768
Cool. Just give me my shit, bro.

339
00:25:39,861 --> 00:25:42,187
I'm sorry.

340
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:44,696
Sure enough! Five-O.

341
00:25:44,908 --> 00:25:45,940
Five-O.

342
00:25:47,244 --> 00:25:48,655
Come on, man.

343
00:25:48,746 --> 00:25:52,744
Shit! Come on, man. Quit treating me
like I'm Tupac. It's my hand!

344
00:25:52,958 --> 00:25:54,453
What are you doing?

345
00:25:54,543 --> 00:25:57,913
- I'm a cop. It's all right.
- Since when do cops make things okay?

346
00:25:58,005 --> 00:25:59,998
Yeah, man! Since when do cops make...

347
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:01,466
Man, this shit hurts!

348
00:26:01,551 --> 00:26:03,508
I'm a political prisoner here, man!

349
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:06,050
Yeah, he's Geronimo Fat.
Now get out of here.

350
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:10,306
Hey, no, don't go! Don't leave!

351
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:14,102
He's going to try to put a plunger
in my ass! What you doing, man?

352
00:26:14,189 --> 00:26:15,731
Don't go anywhere.

353
00:26:16,233 --> 00:26:19,270
Let's see if you have this shit
when you get back out here!

354
00:26:23,658 --> 00:26:25,152
Satisfied?

355
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:27,406
How much?

356
00:26:27,578 --> 00:26:30,414
How about 25?
With a cut here, a cut there...

357
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:34,325
...it'll double your money easily.
Quickest quarter mil you'll ever make.

358
00:26:34,419 --> 00:26:36,791
I need major weight. I need it yesterday.

359
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,205
I really don't want to see any more of this.

360
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:42,549
- Give me a ballpark figure.
- Anywhere in the seven figures.

361
00:26:42,719 --> 00:26:45,720
<i>Yo, it's Five-O! It's a setup! Get out!</i>

362
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,538
Well, I guess the grill was optional.

363
00:27:50,624 --> 00:27:52,913
You have the right
to remain silent, asshole.

364
00:27:53,002 --> 00:27:55,078
Take a look in my back pocket, cop.

365
00:27:55,296 --> 00:27:57,585
You think you can buy your way
out of this?

366
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:07,134
You just ruined three months
of undercover work.

367
00:28:07,225 --> 00:28:09,134
Think of the promotion you're gonna get.

368
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,144
Come on, let's go. Move.

369
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:32,042
- What are you doing?
- I'm already in the intersection!

370
00:28:32,126 --> 00:28:34,831
Next time you see a cop blow a whistle,
pay attention.

371
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:36,250
Blow this.

372
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,056
What, are you blind?

373
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,850
Come on!

374
00:28:55,735 --> 00:28:57,562
Where's a cop when you need one?

375
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:30,219
Fresh meat!

376
00:29:31,689 --> 00:29:32,769
Montini.

377
00:29:33,483 --> 00:29:34,763
Do me at 30.

378
00:29:38,488 --> 00:29:40,315
Go!

379
00:29:54,588 --> 00:29:56,213
Oh, yeah!

380
00:30:03,306 --> 00:30:04,681
Hey, you, Boyd.

381
00:30:08,478 --> 00:30:09,807
No, thanks.

382
00:30:12,649 --> 00:30:13,645
Hey, Serpico.

383
00:30:14,651 --> 00:30:16,146
Afraid of a little pain?

384
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,063
No, I'm just trying to quit.

385
00:30:18,155 --> 00:30:20,646
Maybe you're just hiding
a wire under your shirt.

386
00:30:20,741 --> 00:30:24,157
- Think I'm a plant after the other night?
- Maybe that was your cover.

387
00:30:24,245 --> 00:30:27,448
Who knows? I.A.'s tried everything else
to slip a mole in here.

388
00:30:31,628 --> 00:30:33,003
Go for it.

389
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:36,916
Go easy on the first time.

390
00:30:37,133 --> 00:30:38,841
Give him twenty-five.

391
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,325
Twenty-five, my ass!

392
00:31:19,219 --> 00:31:22,553
The bad guys are out there. Not in here.

393
00:31:28,229 --> 00:31:29,510
Give me my money!

394
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:34,024
See you making friends fast.

395
00:31:37,656 --> 00:31:41,819
Just take some deep breaths, in and out.
How do you feel?

396
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,073
Electrified.

397
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:47,619
Yeah, you'll be all right.
It's just a hazing thing.

398
00:31:48,167 --> 00:31:52,461
Everybody goes through it.
Welcome to the one-five.

399
00:31:59,429 --> 00:32:00,971
- Orin Boyd?
- Yeah.

400
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:03,173
- You're from the two-one, right?
- Yeah.

401
00:32:03,266 --> 00:32:05,555
They said you're coming. I'm George Clark.

402
00:32:05,643 --> 00:32:07,268
Nice to meet you, George.

403
00:32:08,855 --> 00:32:11,181
I mean, you know,
you're like a legend, man.

404
00:32:11,274 --> 00:32:13,979
I used to read about you
in some new caper every week.

405
00:32:14,069 --> 00:32:16,358
- Don't believe everything you read.
- I don't.

406
00:32:16,447 --> 00:32:18,605
But there was one I was curious about.

407
00:32:18,699 --> 00:32:21,272
You really beat a suspect
unconscious with a dead cat?

408
00:32:21,368 --> 00:32:22,400
No.

409
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,283
Cat wasn't dead.

410
00:32:25,873 --> 00:32:27,617
All right. That's funny.

411
00:32:27,917 --> 00:32:30,242
Cop who came in to break it up,
who was that?

412
00:32:30,336 --> 00:32:32,459
Strutt. Sergeant Lewis Strutt.

413
00:32:32,964 --> 00:32:34,755
He's a good man, a fair man.

414
00:32:35,508 --> 00:32:38,130
Listen, don't worry about Montini.
Shit happens.

415
00:32:38,345 --> 00:32:40,219
Who was Montini trying to set up?

416
00:32:40,972 --> 00:32:42,799
That would be Latrell Walker.

417
00:32:43,308 --> 00:32:45,182
Why you ask? You going after him?

418
00:32:56,781 --> 00:32:58,156
Hey, how you doing?

419
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:00,148
What do you need?

420
00:33:00,243 --> 00:33:03,197
I need to see the log book
for the last couple of nights.

421
00:33:03,496 --> 00:33:05,156
- Here.
- Thanks.

422
00:33:11,171 --> 00:33:12,998
Who or what are you looking for?

423
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:15,795
Just some shit bird
who thinks he got away clean.

424
00:33:18,345 --> 00:33:22,011
Can you run a check for it?
All I have is a name, Latrell. Black male.

425
00:33:22,099 --> 00:33:25,385
This isn't the Hall of Records.
Check records downtown.

426
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:27,600
Thanks a lot.

427
00:33:28,022 --> 00:33:29,398
Happy to help you.

428
00:34:24,248 --> 00:34:27,451
I'm the janitor.
My daughter, Maria, is in the office.

429
00:34:28,544 --> 00:34:29,659
Stay down.

430
00:34:58,409 --> 00:35:00,402
I'm one of the good guys. Come here.

431
00:35:37,534 --> 00:35:39,277
Freeze! Don't move!

432
00:35:39,953 --> 00:35:40,984
I'm a cop.

433
00:35:51,632 --> 00:35:54,004
Bruce, get it out of the way.

434
00:35:54,885 --> 00:35:57,174
Can I get you guys in this area over here?

435
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:07,225
Keep it back.
Sorry, people, you'll have to stand back.

436
00:36:09,985 --> 00:36:11,479
Officer Boyd.

437
00:36:12,779 --> 00:36:14,024
What have you got?

438
00:36:14,865 --> 00:36:16,407
Take a look at this.

439
00:36:16,909 --> 00:36:20,029
This was taken a few minutes ago
at the police evidence locker.

440
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:25,032
They keep large quantities of narcotics
here at Piper Tech's main vault.

441
00:36:25,126 --> 00:36:29,254
Yeah, there were six guys. They wore
masks, and their voices were altered.

442
00:36:30,214 --> 00:36:31,673
How much did they take?

443
00:36:31,758 --> 00:36:33,335
About 50 kilos of heroin.

444
00:36:36,346 --> 00:36:38,303
Wait. Can you rewind that bit?

445
00:36:46,774 --> 00:36:48,647
- Freeze on that guy.
- You got it.

446
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,233
Now, can you zoom in right there?

447
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,942
What do you think this is?
<i>Monday Night Football?</i>

448
00:36:54,031 --> 00:36:57,068
Best I can do is 50 percent.

449
00:36:58,661 --> 00:37:00,037
What do you think?

450
00:37:00,121 --> 00:37:02,078
- Rolex?
- It's a TAG.

451
00:37:02,498 --> 00:37:05,120
Height, I'd say about 5'10''?

452
00:37:05,335 --> 00:37:06,414
I'd say so.

453
00:37:06,628 --> 00:37:08,206
And he's black.

454
00:37:10,382 --> 00:37:11,378
Hey, guys.

455
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:13,877
Hey, look who's here.

456
00:37:14,177 --> 00:37:15,636
- Hey, Montini.
- What's up?

457
00:37:15,721 --> 00:37:19,220
Just giving Officer Boyd here a preview
of the playback from security.

458
00:37:19,308 --> 00:37:24,054
Boyd. What are you doing here?
Whose case did you screw up this time?

459
00:37:24,814 --> 00:37:28,099
You guys mind giving us
a moment to ourselves?

460
00:37:28,317 --> 00:37:30,227
We have some catching up to do.

461
00:37:34,824 --> 00:37:38,324
I'm just fucking with you.
No hard feelings about the other night.

462
00:37:38,411 --> 00:37:40,903
Straight up,
I would have done the same thing.

463
00:37:41,081 --> 00:37:43,786
- So what happened here?
- Property vault was hit.

464
00:37:43,959 --> 00:37:45,868
Fifty kilos of heroin stolen.

465
00:37:47,713 --> 00:37:50,121
Shit, someone's having a big party tonight.

466
00:37:50,216 --> 00:37:53,382
- What, professional hit?
- I don't think pros would be so sloppy.

467
00:37:56,514 --> 00:38:00,808
Probably right. I'm going to head up.
You get wind of anything, let me know.

468
00:38:01,019 --> 00:38:02,217
All right.

469
00:38:08,693 --> 00:38:11,101
What the hell were you doing
at Piper Tech?

470
00:38:11,405 --> 00:38:14,074
Last time I checked,
this was the men's locker room.

471
00:38:17,077 --> 00:38:18,619
Answer the question, Boyd.

472
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:21,569
I was driving by and I heard the call.

473
00:38:21,749 --> 00:38:25,961
I told you,
I don't tolerate Ione wolf behavior.

474
00:38:26,045 --> 00:38:28,085
You got a problem, you come to me.

475
00:38:34,596 --> 00:38:36,256
It's my only problem.

476
00:38:42,062 --> 00:38:45,597
All right. I'll tell you what. You're back.

477
00:38:45,774 --> 00:38:49,854
But you're walking the beat. And I'm not
letting you out without a leash.

478
00:38:49,945 --> 00:38:50,977
Hey, George.

479
00:38:51,071 --> 00:38:53,693
Stop robbing the vending machine.
Come over here.

480
00:38:55,618 --> 00:38:58,239
And I want to know every move
you make out there...

481
00:38:58,621 --> 00:39:01,741
...or I will have you typing out
reports till your retirement.

482
00:39:01,833 --> 00:39:04,122
That damn machine ate my quarters again.

483
00:39:04,335 --> 00:39:05,913
- Fifth time.
- Whatever.

484
00:39:06,004 --> 00:39:08,246
George, meet your new partner here.

485
00:39:09,174 --> 00:39:11,712
New partner? You mean the two of us?

486
00:39:11,802 --> 00:39:13,545
You make a nice couple.

487
00:39:26,943 --> 00:39:28,022
It's me, George.

488
00:39:28,111 --> 00:39:29,902
- Okay?
- What are you doing here?

489
00:39:30,113 --> 00:39:32,651
Making a mistake picking you up for work.

490
00:39:32,824 --> 00:39:34,318
Nice place you got here.

491
00:39:35,076 --> 00:39:37,614
<i>Good morning, everyone,</i>
<i>and welcome to</i> Detroit A.M.

492
00:39:37,704 --> 00:39:39,115
<i>I'm your host...</i>

493
00:39:39,581 --> 00:39:41,408
<i>...Henry Wayne.</i>
- I love this guy.

494
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,373
<i>Today, we'll face your worst fears.</i>

495
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,500
<i>- What really ticks you off?</i>
- Henry!

496
00:39:45,754 --> 00:39:49,503
<i>When I'm on the freeway, stuck behind</i>
<i>some idiot going 55 in the fast lane.</i>

497
00:39:49,675 --> 00:39:51,917
- He gets a little carried away.
<i>- What did I do?</i>

498
00:39:52,011 --> 00:39:54,003
<i>Did I casually flip him the bird?</i>

499
00:39:54,513 --> 00:39:57,847
<i>Or did I fantasize</i>
<i>about running them off the road...</i>

500
00:39:57,934 --> 00:39:59,973
<i>... and cutting their freaking head off?</i>

501
00:40:00,061 --> 00:40:01,888
So we got a twelve-block stretch.

502
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:05,313
I like to cruise once or twice,
let the people know we're out here.

503
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,108
Then we can walk it on foot.

504
00:40:07,193 --> 00:40:09,981
I grew up in this area, man.
Now look at it.

505
00:40:10,489 --> 00:40:12,113
Thugs turned it into shit.

506
00:40:12,741 --> 00:40:14,698
Slowly getting a handle on it though.

507
00:40:15,077 --> 00:40:17,532
Might turn this place around after all.

508
00:40:19,206 --> 00:40:21,828
- You married, George?
- Five years next month.

509
00:40:22,585 --> 00:40:25,705
Beautiful woman.
Stuck by me through a lot of shit.

510
00:40:26,297 --> 00:40:28,539
Got a 14-month-old boy.

511
00:40:28,716 --> 00:40:29,795
What about you?

512
00:40:30,301 --> 00:40:33,884
Same old cliché. I guess she got tired
of all those sleepless nights.

513
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:36,718
Tell me about Montini.

514
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:40,343
He's a bully. Been in four shootings.

515
00:40:40,562 --> 00:40:43,100
He's still standing. Figure that out.

516
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:46,192
Hangs out with that mountain man,
Useldinger.

517
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,520
What's the story with him?

518
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:53,112
Strong as an ox. Got the I.Q. of a handball.

519
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:57,317
He was a police officer down south,
spent a year undercover in the KKK.

520
00:40:57,538 --> 00:41:01,204
Wound up taking down a cell
all by himself. That guy's an animal.

521
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:03,286
Good thing Strutt came in...

522
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:06,119
...because he knows
we're all on the same team.

523
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:10,718
- What's the story with Strutt?
- He knows everyone.

524
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:14,054
Need some extra cash,
he can get you a security gig.

525
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:16,630
Tickets to the Red Wings,
he can make it happen.

526
00:41:16,725 --> 00:41:20,474
Anything you want. He's the ultimate
concierge. A tough bastard, too.

527
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:23,851
Sometimes, on duty,
he doesn't wear his gun.

528
00:41:24,066 --> 00:41:27,934
Once pulled a rabid Doberman off this boy
and killed it with his bare hands.

529
00:41:28,738 --> 00:41:31,739
So, you got a thing for Mulcahy, or what?

530
00:41:32,659 --> 00:41:36,407
- I saw the way she was eyeing you.
- How long has she been your commander?

531
00:41:36,496 --> 00:41:39,912
About a year now.
And she did a stint over at I.A.

532
00:41:40,125 --> 00:41:42,034
Cleaned up a lot of precincts, too.

533
00:41:42,127 --> 00:41:44,250
Left I.A. to come over to the 15th.

534
00:41:48,592 --> 00:41:49,755
What do you see?

535
00:41:50,511 --> 00:41:51,756
That yellow Hummer.

536
00:41:52,471 --> 00:41:53,752
I know.

537
00:41:54,974 --> 00:41:58,058
I'm barely making ends meet
and that's that fool's fifth car.

538
00:41:58,144 --> 00:41:59,935
- Who?
- His name's T.K.

539
00:42:00,146 --> 00:42:01,973
He owns a club called The Static.

540
00:42:21,794 --> 00:42:22,576
Hey!

541
00:42:22,795 --> 00:42:26,709
I need to see a little bit more green
than that, baby. Come on, put it on.

542
00:42:26,799 --> 00:42:27,795
I like color.

543
00:42:28,134 --> 00:42:29,712
Yeah. Put it on.

544
00:42:30,136 --> 00:42:31,796
That's it. Squeeze it on.

545
00:42:32,805 --> 00:42:34,549
There you go. Hey, baby.

546
00:42:35,558 --> 00:42:36,969
Put them on the glass.

547
00:42:40,647 --> 00:42:43,399
Them some titties.
Them titties for you all!

548
00:42:44,276 --> 00:42:45,854
That's for you.

549
00:42:46,528 --> 00:42:50,147
What's going on, Joe?
Everything cool? All right.

550
00:42:51,659 --> 00:42:55,075
How's the crowd tonight, man?
All right. See you upstairs.

551
00:42:56,664 --> 00:42:58,906
Yo, what's up, dog. All right, man.

552
00:43:19,229 --> 00:43:21,518
He's here. Bring the truck around back.

553
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:24,769
- Why you looking for him?
- Because I want my grill back.

554
00:43:32,452 --> 00:43:34,859
Yeah, tell them keep shaking that ass!

555
00:43:38,542 --> 00:43:40,534
Look at Rockefeller here. What is it?

556
00:43:40,627 --> 00:43:42,999
Too rich to count the money
the old-fashioned way?

557
00:43:43,088 --> 00:43:44,630
Close the door, man.

558
00:43:46,091 --> 00:43:48,878
Sitting behind my desk in my office
at my club...

559
00:43:48,969 --> 00:43:50,962
...and you want me to close my door?

560
00:43:53,724 --> 00:43:54,839
You paid for it.

561
00:43:55,059 --> 00:43:57,431
- Look like you need a drink.
- Yeah!

562
00:44:02,859 --> 00:44:04,898
You think this deal won't go through?

563
00:44:04,986 --> 00:44:06,231
T, come on, man.

564
00:44:09,115 --> 00:44:10,278
All right.

565
00:44:11,326 --> 00:44:12,904
I'll get that drink for you.

566
00:44:14,788 --> 00:44:16,117
Boss.

567
00:44:18,292 --> 00:44:19,786
T, come here for a minute.

568
00:44:26,634 --> 00:44:27,713
What's up, dog?

569
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:30,761
Where would I be without you, dog?

570
00:44:36,227 --> 00:44:38,054
All by your motherfucking self.

571
00:44:39,397 --> 00:44:40,393
You right.

572
00:44:42,275 --> 00:44:44,648
Now, get my drink, bitch!

573
00:44:47,781 --> 00:44:49,406
Nigger, I got your bitch.

574
00:44:49,575 --> 00:44:53,525
We have an open mike tonight. Come
downstairs and tell some of them jokes.

575
00:44:53,954 --> 00:44:57,869
I said, I want to see asses shaking! Damn!

576
00:45:09,429 --> 00:45:11,338
Baby, can I have a Hennessy Paradis?

577
00:45:11,431 --> 00:45:13,223
Sure, T. We still on for tonight?

578
00:45:13,433 --> 00:45:15,391
Sorry. I can't make that tonight.

579
00:45:15,519 --> 00:45:18,354
But I promise. I'll make it up to you.

580
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:21,481
Why'd you even make plans with me?

581
00:45:22,443 --> 00:45:25,397
I just need a couple more days
to work some shit out.

582
00:45:25,488 --> 00:45:27,196
After that, I'm yours.

583
00:45:27,281 --> 00:45:30,117
Shit. By the end of the night,
you just might...

584
00:45:31,452 --> 00:45:32,733
Fuck me!

585
00:45:32,829 --> 00:45:34,288
Dang! Now you talking.

586
00:45:35,290 --> 00:45:36,286
Shit!

587
00:45:45,384 --> 00:45:47,127
What's up, man? What's up?

588
00:45:48,137 --> 00:45:50,842
What's the matter?
You couldn't get in the VIP room?

589
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:53,217
Have a drink, motherfucker.

590
00:46:02,819 --> 00:46:04,646
Say hello to my sumo Negro.

591
00:46:05,488 --> 00:46:07,647
He about to turn your ass into sashimi.

592
00:46:18,085 --> 00:46:20,042
You in trouble now, sucker.

593
00:46:23,883 --> 00:46:26,588
You aren't doing shit. Get his ass!

594
00:46:51,036 --> 00:46:53,243
There you go, Joe! Kick his ass.

595
00:47:23,863 --> 00:47:24,894
Shit.

596
00:47:25,114 --> 00:47:26,739
Get out of my way! Move!

597
00:47:31,412 --> 00:47:32,907
Freeze! Police!

598
00:47:33,998 --> 00:47:35,457
Put the briefcase down.

599
00:47:38,169 --> 00:47:39,368
Hands in the air.

600
00:47:40,464 --> 00:47:41,709
Up against the wall.

601
00:47:48,013 --> 00:47:49,840
Keep them against the wall.

602
00:47:55,062 --> 00:47:56,687
Got anything in your pocket?

603
00:47:58,483 --> 00:48:00,274
What's this? Don't move.

604
00:48:02,237 --> 00:48:03,565
Got a permit for this?

605
00:48:31,976 --> 00:48:34,218
Come on! Grab the gun! Let's roll!

606
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,479
Oh, shit!

607
00:48:42,237 --> 00:48:45,653
Shit! I'm fucking up my Versace shit!

608
00:48:45,866 --> 00:48:48,238
Come on, dog. Pull me through. Shit!

609
00:48:55,501 --> 00:48:57,079
What are we doing, Boyd?

610
00:48:57,670 --> 00:48:59,497
What are we fucking doing, man?

611
00:48:59,881 --> 00:49:02,336
Either we call backup, or get out of here.

612
00:49:02,926 --> 00:49:04,669
What backup? We ain't here.

613
00:49:04,761 --> 00:49:07,845
Would you answer my question?
I almost fucking died tonight.

614
00:49:08,515 --> 00:49:10,258
Sit down before you fall down.

615
00:49:30,204 --> 00:49:32,530
How are you doing? Come sit down.

616
00:49:39,965 --> 00:49:42,966
- And you are?
- Officer Boyd. I've a few questions for you.

617
00:49:43,719 --> 00:49:45,795
Before you even get into all that...

618
00:49:45,971 --> 00:49:48,842
...you shouldn't be asking me.
I don't know nothing.

619
00:49:48,932 --> 00:49:52,302
Let's start with something simple,
like who is Latrell Walker?

620
00:49:53,145 --> 00:49:54,604
Never heard of him.

621
00:49:54,689 --> 00:49:57,262
Says in here he visited you
a number of times.

622
00:49:57,358 --> 00:49:58,983
Is he a friend of yours?

623
00:49:59,068 --> 00:50:00,812
Said I'd never heard of him.

624
00:50:01,321 --> 00:50:03,064
Are you deaf or something?

625
00:50:03,281 --> 00:50:06,199
No, I'm persistent.
I ran a check on this guy.

626
00:50:06,409 --> 00:50:09,410
Came up empty.
Guy's clean, like a little too clean.

627
00:50:09,496 --> 00:50:11,821
No warrants, no accidents,
no parking tickets.

628
00:50:11,915 --> 00:50:15,082
It's like the guy was born yesterday,
and that makes me nervous.

629
00:50:15,168 --> 00:50:16,367
Your point is?

630
00:50:16,587 --> 00:50:19,504
I want to know
what your relationship is with him.

631
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:22,342
Did he take over your business
when you went away?

632
00:50:22,426 --> 00:50:24,383
I don't know what you talking about.

633
00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:26,427
Is it meth? Is it coke? What is it?

634
00:50:29,183 --> 00:50:32,849
It was heroin. Thought you knew that.

635
00:50:32,937 --> 00:50:35,974
I know it say it right there. Come on, man.

636
00:50:36,066 --> 00:50:38,557
The cops swear
you all know everything, man.

637
00:50:39,194 --> 00:50:40,190
Know what, man?

638
00:50:40,821 --> 00:50:43,027
You didn't learn nothing in juvie, did you?

639
00:50:43,115 --> 00:50:45,902
Supposed to teach you not to piss
your life away...

640
00:50:45,993 --> 00:50:47,452
...but you keep running back.

641
00:50:47,536 --> 00:50:49,410
That's real clever. You know?

642
00:50:49,496 --> 00:50:52,070
You ain't got a clue what's going on.

643
00:50:52,708 --> 00:50:55,164
Your eyes is glued the fuck shut.

644
00:50:56,045 --> 00:50:56,875
Pig.

645
00:50:57,088 --> 00:50:59,793
You wanna do 10 years in here?
That's your business.

646
00:50:59,882 --> 00:51:03,583
If I were you,
I'd be grabbing for every lifeline tossed out.

647
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,048
Know what I'm saying?

648
00:51:07,807 --> 00:51:09,385
You can't help me, man.

649
00:51:11,645 --> 00:51:13,222
Can't help me at all.

650
00:51:20,321 --> 00:51:25,113
You cannot put Tiger Woods
in the same league as Michael Jordan.

651
00:51:25,326 --> 00:51:27,568
You don't have to be in shape to play golf.

652
00:51:27,662 --> 00:51:29,987
You walk everywhere for Christ's sakes.

653
00:51:30,248 --> 00:51:33,000
But Woods bench presses
damn near 300 pounds.

654
00:51:33,084 --> 00:51:35,836
Well, unless he bench presses my dick...

655
00:51:36,046 --> 00:51:38,619
...I'm really not impressed,
to tell you the truth.

656
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:41,925
- I'd say Wayne Gretzky's the best.
- You freaking Canadians.

657
00:51:42,094 --> 00:51:45,178
You worship the guy.
You'd crucify the mother, ay?

658
00:51:45,389 --> 00:51:46,551
Whatever, Dinger.

659
00:51:47,725 --> 00:51:49,183
I got one. Babe Ruth.

660
00:51:49,268 --> 00:51:50,299
- Baseball?
- Who?

661
00:51:50,519 --> 00:51:53,271
Fall asleep during the action.

662
00:51:53,439 --> 00:51:55,645
Don't knock baseball. That's un-American.

663
00:51:55,733 --> 00:51:57,358
Wake me up when it's over.

664
00:51:57,443 --> 00:51:59,270
Come on, guys. Come on.

665
00:51:59,529 --> 00:52:02,732
The greatest athlete without a doubt
was Muhammad Ali.

666
00:52:02,824 --> 00:52:04,698
He could defeat you with his mind.

667
00:52:04,868 --> 00:52:08,533
He would never have to put a finger
on you, and have you psyched out.

668
00:52:09,456 --> 00:52:11,283
- To The Greatest.
- To The Greatest.

669
00:52:14,461 --> 00:52:15,457
Hey.

670
00:52:18,132 --> 00:52:19,294
How's your head?

671
00:52:20,551 --> 00:52:23,468
Head is fine.
It's my pride that's still hurting.

672
00:52:23,554 --> 00:52:24,799
Question for you.

673
00:52:24,889 --> 00:52:28,554
Six months ago, there was a bust.
A kid named Shaun Rollins. Remember?

674
00:52:28,643 --> 00:52:31,727
- Yeah, vaguely. Why?
- Anything suspicious about that arrest?

675
00:52:31,813 --> 00:52:34,102
Far as I can remember, it was clean.

676
00:52:34,315 --> 00:52:38,064
Montini always pays attention to detail
when he types those things up.

677
00:52:38,153 --> 00:52:40,726
- Montini was the arresting officer?
- Yeah. Why?

678
00:52:40,822 --> 00:52:43,823
Where could I find him?
To put two and two together...

679
00:52:43,909 --> 00:52:44,905
...even things up.

680
00:53:06,891 --> 00:53:08,172
Relax.

681
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:10,724
- What the fuck you doing?
- Shut up. Hands down.

682
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:13,513
- What are you doing?
- Why you pressing me?

683
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:16,181
- Who's pressing you?
- You got a cop on my ass.

684
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,020
Same guy from the other night.

685
00:53:18,112 --> 00:53:21,278
He's a Neanderthal. He keeps popping up
all over the place.

686
00:53:22,783 --> 00:53:24,610
He's not one of ours.

687
00:53:24,827 --> 00:53:28,196
I'll take care of him. But what
were you thinking, showing up here?

688
00:53:28,289 --> 00:53:30,282
I should just shoot you in case...

689
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:32,951
Look, if I wanted to bust you, man...

690
00:53:33,044 --> 00:53:36,460
...I'd have brought you in a long time ago.
This is business.

691
00:53:36,548 --> 00:53:39,632
I just got a shitload of product
for our next deal.

692
00:53:47,392 --> 00:53:49,184
- Forget it.
- How much?

693
00:53:49,979 --> 00:53:51,259
Around $5 million.

694
00:53:51,355 --> 00:53:52,470
Yeah, right.

695
00:53:52,690 --> 00:53:55,607
You wanted seven figures,
that's what I brought, right?

696
00:53:56,485 --> 00:53:58,811
If not, then we do have a big problem.

697
00:53:59,071 --> 00:54:03,449
$5 million? It'll get me locked up
until I'm eligible for social security.

698
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:07,076
I don't need social security, asshole.
I need police security.

699
00:54:07,664 --> 00:54:09,822
So before we do any more business...

700
00:54:10,667 --> 00:54:13,123
...you let me know
you got shit under control.

701
00:54:14,212 --> 00:54:15,208
All right.

702
00:54:15,923 --> 00:54:19,007
Would it ease your worries
if I showed you our operation?

703
00:54:21,345 --> 00:54:22,839
Fucking right.

704
00:54:23,431 --> 00:54:24,545
Fine.

705
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:29,683
We'll call you when we're ready.
You just have the money together.

706
00:54:32,607 --> 00:54:33,437
Done.

707
00:54:51,627 --> 00:54:54,165
Really, Henry.
Right after group and everything.

708
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:55,708
Boyd? Shit!

709
00:54:56,924 --> 00:54:58,716
I just came in to use the phone.

710
00:54:58,801 --> 00:55:00,841
Relax, man. I just need a favor.

711
00:55:00,928 --> 00:55:03,846
Ladies, would you let me talk
to my friend for a minute?

712
00:55:05,433 --> 00:55:09,645
Anything. You need me to go undercover?
I'm like a chameleon.

713
00:55:09,729 --> 00:55:13,478
It also looks like you're kicking
a lot of big ass there. How many guys?

714
00:55:13,567 --> 00:55:16,319
Two, but they were huge.
They were meat packers.

715
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:20,154
I could've used some of your moves.
Maybe you could teach me.

716
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:24,025
Later. You know that exposé you did
on the Mob a few years ago?

717
00:55:25,287 --> 00:55:27,079
How'd you get that intel?

718
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:31,334
I can be resourceful. Plus, I work
with the I Team, a group of former PI's...

719
00:55:31,419 --> 00:55:35,002
...who owe us their licenses
due to various felony convictions.

720
00:55:35,089 --> 00:55:38,755
I need you to find out whatever you can
about a guy called Latrell Walker.

721
00:55:38,843 --> 00:55:40,836
His identity seems to be a total scam.

722
00:55:41,138 --> 00:55:44,922
And also what his connection is
with a guy called Shaun Rollins. Can you?

723
00:55:45,017 --> 00:55:48,184
I'll see what I can dig up.
Why'd you come to me?

724
00:55:48,437 --> 00:55:50,477
I don't want to attract any attention.

725
00:55:50,564 --> 00:55:53,234
And I think your peculiar methods
might work for me.

726
00:55:53,317 --> 00:55:55,559
- What's this all about?
- It might be nothing.

727
00:55:55,653 --> 00:55:58,405
It might be something.
If it's big, it's really big.

728
00:55:58,489 --> 00:56:01,194
I just got to see
how high up this shit goes.

729
00:56:01,492 --> 00:56:02,868
Don't screw this one up.

730
00:56:02,952 --> 00:56:05,788
I won't,
because I've seen you when you're angry.

731
00:56:05,997 --> 00:56:07,456
All right, ladies?

732
00:56:07,666 --> 00:56:08,697
Come to papa.

733
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:10,702
- You want in on this?
- No.

734
00:56:12,838 --> 00:56:14,581
I just want to make a toast.

735
00:56:14,673 --> 00:56:18,172
This is to us
finally getting together for dinner.

736
00:56:19,553 --> 00:56:21,261
But I just have one request.

737
00:56:22,014 --> 00:56:23,343
I'm listening.

738
00:56:23,557 --> 00:56:24,720
No police talk.

739
00:56:25,226 --> 00:56:28,227
No mentioning the latest homicide
or gang shooting.

740
00:56:29,063 --> 00:56:31,435
Tonight, just happy thoughts. Agreed?

741
00:56:31,649 --> 00:56:34,057
Agreed. To happy thoughts.

742
00:56:36,613 --> 00:56:38,072
Good evening, Commander.

743
00:56:40,325 --> 00:56:41,985
What're you doing here, Boyd?

744
00:56:42,077 --> 00:56:44,829
- You wanted to see me.
- In my office, not here.

745
00:56:44,913 --> 00:56:46,823
But I'm here now. So let's talk.

746
00:56:46,915 --> 00:56:49,751
I'm sorry,
but we were actually right in the middle.

747
00:56:50,461 --> 00:56:51,920
Why don't you take a walk?

748
00:56:53,172 --> 00:56:56,090
It's okay. Just give us five minutes.

749
00:56:59,053 --> 00:57:01,046
I had to go to the men's room anyway.

750
00:57:05,393 --> 00:57:08,347
- How'd you find me?
- What are you doing with this guy?

751
00:57:08,438 --> 00:57:10,810
That is none of your business.

752
00:57:11,024 --> 00:57:14,393
- He doesn't look right for you.
- And you do?

753
00:57:15,571 --> 00:57:17,729
What did you want to talk to me about?

754
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:19,566
Why'd you visit Shaun Rollins?

755
00:57:19,658 --> 00:57:23,027
- The walls have ears.
- I know everything, Boyd.

756
00:57:23,412 --> 00:57:25,072
So, why am I here?

757
00:57:25,289 --> 00:57:27,780
I don't have time for games.
What are you up to?

758
00:57:28,793 --> 00:57:31,628
- You used to work for Internal Affairs.
- Yeah.

759
00:57:31,754 --> 00:57:35,835
Out of all the people around you,
how'd you know who you could trust?

760
00:57:36,468 --> 00:57:38,010
Why? What have you got?

761
00:57:38,094 --> 00:57:41,926
I can't say yet. Not till I have more proof.
What have you got?

762
00:57:42,391 --> 00:57:45,807
Let's just say my instincts tell me
something's not quite right.

763
00:57:47,563 --> 00:57:49,057
Bring me something solid.

764
00:57:49,148 --> 00:57:50,642
I have something solid.

765
00:57:51,108 --> 00:57:52,139
More solid.

766
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:56,395
- Then I'll know what to do with it.
- You'll know what to do with it?

767
00:57:58,032 --> 00:57:59,361
- Carmine?
- Good.

768
00:58:01,077 --> 00:58:03,485
Not bad. I'll see you on campus.

769
00:58:13,882 --> 00:58:14,961
Watch your back.

770
00:58:39,826 --> 00:58:41,653
Hey, Clark. What's going on?

771
00:58:41,870 --> 00:58:43,910
Six. Nothing much.

772
00:58:44,122 --> 00:58:47,040
I hear you're working with Supercop now.

773
00:58:47,417 --> 00:58:48,698
What's that like?

774
00:58:48,794 --> 00:58:51,285
Hey, George.
Which one are you? Starsky or Hutch?

775
00:58:52,590 --> 00:58:53,704
Don't mind him.

776
00:58:54,091 --> 00:58:55,254
I don't.

777
00:58:58,054 --> 00:59:00,343
Heard about that scuffle.

778
00:59:00,515 --> 00:59:02,840
What were you doing
at The Static anyway?

779
00:59:03,142 --> 00:59:05,182
Orin wanted to question the owner, T.K.

780
00:59:05,770 --> 00:59:06,766
About what?

781
00:59:07,605 --> 00:59:08,886
They never spoke.

782
00:59:09,107 --> 00:59:11,314
Boyd's trying to steal my bust, George.

783
00:59:11,526 --> 00:59:14,064
He's a glory hound.
We've seen this kind before.

784
00:59:14,321 --> 00:59:16,064
What else did you find out?

785
00:59:16,156 --> 00:59:18,612
Nothing. We searched his office,
came up empty.

786
00:59:18,701 --> 00:59:21,239
I wish you would have called
the point detective.

787
00:59:21,328 --> 00:59:22,906
I would've found something.

788
00:59:22,997 --> 00:59:26,911
We did find a visitor's pass from County.
Don't worry, Montini.

789
00:59:27,001 --> 00:59:29,124
We'll let you know what we come up with.

790
00:59:34,050 --> 00:59:35,758
You guys done with the bench?

791
00:59:36,177 --> 00:59:37,755
Yeah, go ahead.

792
00:59:37,846 --> 00:59:39,340
Hey, you know, Montini?

793
00:59:39,431 --> 00:59:42,467
If all you come down here
to do is work out your mouth...

794
00:59:42,684 --> 00:59:45,436
...maybe you should move on.
Breaks our concentration.

795
00:59:54,405 --> 00:59:56,563
Find out who they visited up at County.

796
00:59:56,657 --> 00:59:58,899
Yeah, don't worry about that, I'm on it.

797
01:00:28,232 --> 01:00:29,561
You come with me.

798
01:00:29,734 --> 01:00:31,358
Be back in an hour.

799
01:00:44,875 --> 01:00:46,499
Ready to meet the wizard?

800
01:00:48,796 --> 01:00:50,171
Put it on.

801
01:00:54,093 --> 01:00:56,335
You don't need to know where we're going.

802
01:00:57,930 --> 01:01:00,801
<i>Welcome to the inner sanctum, Mr. Walker.</i>

803
01:01:04,437 --> 01:01:05,848
I always wanted to do that.

804
01:01:06,147 --> 01:01:07,428
I wish I had a cat.

805
01:01:07,691 --> 01:01:09,066
Heard a lot about you.

806
01:01:09,150 --> 01:01:10,728
Wish I could say the same.

807
01:01:11,528 --> 01:01:13,604
Like the saying goes:

808
01:01:13,947 --> 01:01:18,360
''The greatest trick the devil ever pulled
was convince the world he didn't exist.''

809
01:01:19,411 --> 01:01:21,036
Let me show you around.

810
01:01:46,607 --> 01:01:48,813
I don't get it. T-shirts?

811
01:01:49,026 --> 01:01:51,564
Amazing what you can do
with the right chemicals.

812
01:01:51,654 --> 01:01:54,904
Your connections are all over the country,
this is our plan...

813
01:01:54,990 --> 01:01:56,900
...to get the heroin out of state.

814
01:01:56,993 --> 01:01:59,744
No risky exposure, no trail back to us.

815
01:01:59,829 --> 01:02:03,198
These T-shirts are dipped
in a heroin solution...

816
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,325
...and dried under these lamps.

817
01:02:06,795 --> 01:02:09,202
They're folded and sealed in shrink-wrap.

818
01:02:10,507 --> 01:02:12,167
Dogs can't even smell it.

819
01:02:12,342 --> 01:02:14,251
You can send them anywhere you want.

820
01:02:14,344 --> 01:02:15,839
Extract the heroin later.

821
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:17,795
You in?

822
01:02:21,018 --> 01:02:22,014
Yeah, I'm in.

823
01:02:23,979 --> 01:02:25,557
Pick you up at midnight.

824
01:02:44,251 --> 01:02:47,786
Me and the I Team came up
with some fascinating intel.

825
01:02:47,963 --> 01:02:50,419
Latrell Walker's whole I.D.'s fake.
He's a shell.

826
01:02:50,507 --> 01:02:52,714
He paid a lot too. He's got everything.

827
01:02:52,802 --> 01:02:55,423
Driver's license, birth certificate,
credit cards.

828
01:02:55,513 --> 01:02:57,802
He's even got a voter's registration card.

829
01:02:57,890 --> 01:03:00,560
Normal investigation
wouldn't have uncovered this...

830
01:03:00,643 --> 01:03:04,937
...but one of our dudes worked for the IRS,
and can computer-dissect anybody.

831
01:03:05,023 --> 01:03:06,434
Who is he, then?

832
01:03:06,649 --> 01:03:08,393
He's Shaun Rollins' brother.

833
01:03:08,735 --> 01:03:09,766
Listen to this.

834
01:03:09,861 --> 01:03:13,645
<i>About six months ago,</i>
<i>Latrell's little brother, Shaun, gets popped.</i>

835
01:03:13,824 --> 01:03:17,608
<i>He claims the heroin was planted,</i>
<i>but the cops made the charges stick.</i>

836
01:03:17,703 --> 01:03:20,241
<i>Next thing you know,</i>
<i>Latrell's back in town.</i>

837
01:03:20,331 --> 01:03:22,074
<i>That's why he was visiting him.</i>

838
01:03:22,166 --> 01:03:26,579
<i>My sources ran a check on Shaun also,</i>
<i>and he's set for life financially.</i>

839
01:03:26,671 --> 01:03:28,046
<i>How? From who?</i>

840
01:03:28,339 --> 01:03:31,174
<i>He has a trust fund</i>
<i>set up in his name for millions...</i>

841
01:03:31,259 --> 01:03:33,335
<i>... but he can't touch it until he's 25.</i>

842
01:03:33,428 --> 01:03:35,800
<i>- Who set it up for him?</i>
<i>- I'm getting to that.</i>

843
01:03:35,889 --> 01:03:39,673
<i>Shaun also has another brother, Leon.</i>
<i>Or so I thought.</i>

844
01:03:39,768 --> 01:03:43,516
<i>Now, Leon Rollins and Latrell Walker</i>
<i>are the same person.</i>

845
01:03:43,605 --> 01:03:44,850
<i>You're shitting me.</i>

846
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:47,265
<i>Leon's also a gazillionaire.</i>

847
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:51,145
<i>How can a guy with no record</i>
<i>make so much money dealing heroin?</i>

848
01:03:51,238 --> 01:03:53,729
<i>No, no. The guy's a computer wiz.</i>

849
01:03:53,949 --> 01:03:57,615
<i>Started up a dot com out of Virginia</i>
<i>called $9.99 Dot Com.</i>

850
01:03:57,703 --> 01:03:59,530
<i>"Anything you want under $10."</i>

851
01:03:59,622 --> 01:04:04,035
<i>And he did great. Lucky bastard</i>
<i>cashed out just before the bubble burst.</i>

852
01:04:04,127 --> 01:04:08,836
<i>Maybe Latrell's buying heroin,</i>
<i>and seeking distributors on the Internet.</i>

853
01:04:08,965 --> 01:04:11,005
Welcome to the Computer Age, my friend.

854
01:04:11,218 --> 01:04:14,338
No street involvement,
no watching out for cops, no risk.

855
01:04:14,429 --> 01:04:15,924
It's brilliant, isn't it?

856
01:04:17,433 --> 01:04:20,350
It still doesn't add up
unless they have some big debts.

857
01:04:20,436 --> 01:04:24,054
Well, here's all the paperwork.
I got IPO statements, tax returns.

858
01:04:24,148 --> 01:04:27,184
I got his address
from a crooked car dealer we investigated.

859
01:04:27,276 --> 01:04:29,850
I don't know if it will help, but I did my job.

860
01:04:30,613 --> 01:04:31,894
You did good, man.

861
01:04:33,157 --> 01:04:33,987
Thanks, partner.

862
01:06:05,755 --> 01:06:07,000
Let's go. Smash it!

863
01:06:10,844 --> 01:06:12,255
Let's move it!

864
01:06:31,282 --> 01:06:33,773
Montini, Useldinger...

865
01:06:33,952 --> 01:06:35,446
...what a surprise.

866
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:38,539
This to make me talk?

867
01:06:38,623 --> 01:06:40,367
No, it's to make you die.

868
01:06:40,458 --> 01:06:43,543
It's from Latrell.
He made us an offer we couldn't refuse.

869
01:06:59,312 --> 01:07:00,391
Look out!

870
01:07:04,567 --> 01:07:06,109
Shoot him!

871
01:08:45,799 --> 01:08:48,171
You don't have the balls to kill me yourself.

872
01:08:48,260 --> 01:08:50,585
You don't know what you're talking about.

873
01:08:52,890 --> 01:08:55,179
- I know everything about you.
- About time.

874
01:08:55,267 --> 01:08:57,011
But why would I want you dead?

875
01:08:57,103 --> 01:09:00,139
Because I'm that close to locking you up
with your brother.

876
01:09:22,713 --> 01:09:24,789
You want to see what's really going on?

877
01:09:29,804 --> 01:09:30,967
Come on.

878
01:09:46,154 --> 01:09:48,776
It's all right, it's all right. Chill.

879
01:09:49,992 --> 01:09:51,403
This is my operation.

880
01:09:54,455 --> 01:09:56,661
- What's up, man?
- Yeah, it's all right.

881
01:10:01,170 --> 01:10:03,246
I believe you two have already met.

882
01:10:04,883 --> 01:10:06,756
What the hell're you doing here?

883
01:10:06,843 --> 01:10:08,670
You want another ass-whupping?

884
01:10:09,095 --> 01:10:11,551
I'm joking. I got your grill downstairs.

885
01:10:11,681 --> 01:10:13,721
I can send somebody to get it if you want.

886
01:10:13,809 --> 01:10:15,848
Come, I want to show you something.

887
01:10:22,109 --> 01:10:23,354
All right.

888
01:10:24,779 --> 01:10:25,727
You.

889
01:10:25,946 --> 01:10:26,942
Good memory.

890
01:10:27,156 --> 01:10:29,030
This is Trish, my guardian angel.

891
01:10:29,784 --> 01:10:32,357
- She's helping out with the project.
- What project?

892
01:10:32,453 --> 01:10:36,451
See, a lot of people talk about
police corruption, but no one ever sees it.

893
01:10:37,250 --> 01:10:40,417
I figured I'd be the one to show it to them,
over the Internet.

894
01:10:40,629 --> 01:10:41,874
Have a seat.

895
01:10:43,048 --> 01:10:45,171
<i>- How much?</i>
<i>- How about 25?</i>

896
01:10:45,384 --> 01:10:47,044
<i>With a cut here, a cut there...</i>

897
01:10:47,219 --> 01:10:50,968
<i>... it'll double your money easily.</i>
<i>Quickest quarter mil you'll ever make.</i>

898
01:10:51,181 --> 01:10:53,637
<i>I need major weight. I need it yesterday.</i>

899
01:10:53,851 --> 01:10:56,176
We've been tracking
their activity for months.

900
01:10:56,395 --> 01:10:59,515
I'm compiling the video
on our digital editing system.

901
01:10:59,607 --> 01:11:00,770
<i>You come with me.</i>

902
01:11:00,858 --> 01:11:02,056
<i>Be back in an hour.</i>

903
01:11:02,235 --> 01:11:05,651
When we have enough evidence,
we'll show it to the authorities.

904
01:11:07,949 --> 01:11:10,903
If that doesn't work,
we'll post the video on our website.

905
01:11:10,994 --> 01:11:12,654
<i>Why you pressing me?</i>

906
01:11:12,871 --> 01:11:17,498
<i>Look, if I wanted to bust you, man,</i>
<i>I'd have brought you in a long time ago.</i>

907
01:11:17,709 --> 01:11:21,659
<i>This is business. I just got a shitload</i>
<i>of product for our next deal.</i>

908
01:11:21,881 --> 01:11:23,256
Incriminating shit.

909
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:28,001
They think I'm a buyer from the
West Coast looking to score major weight.

910
01:11:28,179 --> 01:11:29,507
They raised it, too.

911
01:11:29,597 --> 01:11:33,346
I don't know how, but they managed
to get $5 million worth of shit.

912
01:11:33,851 --> 01:11:34,847
Piper Tech.

913
01:11:35,353 --> 01:11:36,551
Run number 8.

914
01:11:37,021 --> 01:11:38,765
- You sure?
- Yeah.

915
01:11:40,108 --> 01:11:42,943
<i>Welcome to the inner sanctum, Mr. Walker.</i>

916
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:46,940
<i>I always wanted to do that.</i>

917
01:11:47,115 --> 01:11:48,942
You didn't know he was in on it?

918
01:11:49,034 --> 01:11:53,162
<i>"The greatest trick the devil ever pulled</i>
<i>was convince the world he didn't exist."</i>

919
01:11:53,664 --> 01:11:55,372
Where'd you guys get this stuff?

920
01:11:55,458 --> 01:11:58,079
From everywhere. Check it out.

921
01:11:58,753 --> 01:12:01,707
This is our stuff.
We have cameras hidden in everything.

922
01:12:02,298 --> 01:12:05,418
Watches, batteries, purses. You name it.

923
01:12:07,220 --> 01:12:11,300
This is a little camera that can be hidden
everywhere and can see everything.

924
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:14,554
And you're the star of a few of these
as well.

925
01:12:16,563 --> 01:12:17,974
<i>Come on, let me go.</i>

926
01:12:18,148 --> 01:12:20,271
<i>Shit, man!</i>

927
01:12:22,152 --> 01:12:23,398
<i>Come on!</i>

928
01:12:23,571 --> 01:12:25,065
Lucky move.

929
01:12:26,324 --> 01:12:27,569
Unlucky face.

930
01:12:28,409 --> 01:12:30,318
T, get us something to drink.

931
01:12:30,578 --> 01:12:34,113
Just because I own a bar don't mean
I'm Isaac from <i>The Love Boat.</i>

932
01:12:34,332 --> 01:12:35,910
A Hennessy Paradis, please.

933
01:12:36,167 --> 01:12:39,334
Yes, master.
Should I get some for Mr. Charlie, too?

934
01:12:41,965 --> 01:12:43,246
What do you think?

935
01:12:43,341 --> 01:12:45,381
I think we need to take them down now.

936
01:12:45,469 --> 01:12:48,920
Not yet. I want to catch
all these guys at once. Stick it to them.

937
01:12:49,014 --> 01:12:50,674
I won't wait. They tried to kill me.

938
01:12:50,766 --> 01:12:53,803
I won't let you ruin this.
My brother's ass is on the line.

939
01:12:53,894 --> 01:12:55,472
What's he got to do with it?

940
01:12:55,604 --> 01:12:58,689
Your buddies wanted
their own drug dealer on the street.

941
01:12:58,858 --> 01:13:02,357
Rather than lose him, they framed Shaun.
I got to get him out of jail.

942
01:13:03,196 --> 01:13:05,438
I made my father a promise before he died.

943
01:13:06,032 --> 01:13:08,191
That I'd always be my brother's keeper.

944
01:13:09,452 --> 01:13:10,697
I keep my promises.

945
01:13:13,373 --> 01:13:15,615
Where'd you promise to meet these boys?

946
01:13:16,126 --> 01:13:17,870
Frederick's Cleaners.

947
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:21,209
After midnight.

948
01:13:21,465 --> 01:13:22,544
I'll need a car.

949
01:13:24,301 --> 01:13:25,582
Give him the keys.

950
01:13:26,679 --> 01:13:28,257
T, the keys.

951
01:13:30,266 --> 01:13:32,674
Come on, man.
My mama don't even drive my car.

952
01:13:32,769 --> 01:13:34,263
Give him the keys.

953
01:13:37,732 --> 01:13:39,274
You scratch it, you buy it.

954
01:14:21,737 --> 01:14:23,979
Nice inconspicuous car you got there.

955
01:14:24,198 --> 01:14:25,526
Thank you.

956
01:14:25,783 --> 01:14:27,063
What'd you find out?

957
01:14:27,159 --> 01:14:28,951
Piper Tech was hit by cops.

958
01:14:29,370 --> 01:14:30,615
- Cops?
- Yeah.

959
01:14:31,289 --> 01:14:32,285
Come on, Boyd.

960
01:14:32,540 --> 01:14:35,874
Strutt, Useldinger, Montini,
they're all dirty.

961
01:14:37,921 --> 01:14:41,041
Are you positive?
What proof do you have?

962
01:14:41,132 --> 01:14:42,128
Start the car.

963
01:14:57,191 --> 01:14:58,769
Get the car! Let's go!

964
01:15:00,903 --> 01:15:02,563
- Is that proof enough?
- Yeah.

965
01:15:02,780 --> 01:15:03,812
Now move.

966
01:15:13,917 --> 01:15:15,874
Step on it. We got him.

967
01:15:50,497 --> 01:15:51,327
Come on!

968
01:15:55,002 --> 01:15:57,125
- There he is.
- Pop him now!

969
01:15:58,047 --> 01:15:59,126
Shit!

970
01:16:02,885 --> 01:16:03,881
Hold on!

971
01:16:16,191 --> 01:16:18,765
- I always said women are bad drivers.
- I agree.

972
01:16:24,492 --> 01:16:26,235
- There he is!
- Yeah.

973
01:16:29,247 --> 01:16:31,239
Get up on them!

974
01:16:37,213 --> 01:16:38,127
Shit!

975
01:16:39,174 --> 01:16:41,083
Shit! Goddamn!

976
01:16:44,429 --> 01:16:46,505
Get out of the way!

977
01:16:56,692 --> 01:16:58,519
Get out of the way!

978
01:16:58,778 --> 01:17:00,272
- Go right.
- Going left.

979
01:17:02,865 --> 01:17:04,028
Get up to him!

980
01:17:04,409 --> 01:17:05,868
Shoot him!

981
01:17:26,849 --> 01:17:27,880
Damn!

982
01:17:28,893 --> 01:17:30,553
Hey, my bike!

983
01:17:31,312 --> 01:17:33,221
I got a date tonight!

984
01:17:38,737 --> 01:17:40,065
Move!

985
01:17:46,286 --> 01:17:48,078
Get out of the way!

986
01:17:58,174 --> 01:17:59,502
Go around!

987
01:18:30,541 --> 01:18:31,407
Oh, shit!

988
01:18:49,395 --> 01:18:50,972
Push it through!

989
01:18:58,905 --> 01:18:59,818
Fucker.

990
01:19:04,744 --> 01:19:05,740
Look out!

991
01:19:05,912 --> 01:19:08,450
Just get it off! Just get it off!

992
01:19:08,540 --> 01:19:09,654
There!

993
01:19:21,262 --> 01:19:22,590
Get the fuck off...

994
01:19:46,079 --> 01:19:49,449
- This better be good.
<i>- Frank, I'm in hell.</i>

995
01:19:50,334 --> 01:19:52,659
What happened?
There's an APB out on you.

996
01:19:52,753 --> 01:19:56,288
Mulcahy's dead, you fled the scene.
They're pinning Piper Tech on you.

997
01:19:56,382 --> 01:19:59,549
Strutt and Montini.
They're behind everything.

998
01:19:59,677 --> 01:20:02,382
<i>- How do you know that?</i>
- Because they tried to kill me.

999
01:20:02,472 --> 01:20:04,879
- Look...
<i>- Frank, you've known me for a long time.</i>

1000
01:20:04,974 --> 01:20:06,682
Have I ever lied to you?

1001
01:20:08,019 --> 01:20:09,478
What do you want me to do?

1002
01:20:09,562 --> 01:20:11,555
You said I never think before I act.

1003
01:20:11,982 --> 01:20:13,690
Well, I'm thinking now.

1004
01:20:14,568 --> 01:20:16,110
I need backup.

1005
01:20:16,403 --> 01:20:18,396
There's a deal to go down in an hour.

1006
01:20:18,489 --> 01:20:21,240
<i>Strutt's selling the heroin he stole</i>
<i>from Piper Tech.</i>

1007
01:20:21,325 --> 01:20:22,570
I'll get some men.

1008
01:20:23,327 --> 01:20:25,735
Strutt? What the hell
are you talking about?

1009
01:20:25,830 --> 01:20:29,958
I understand if you don't believe me. You
said you wanted to clean up the streets.

1010
01:20:30,042 --> 01:20:31,241
Here's your chance.

1011
01:20:39,177 --> 01:20:40,636
Give me the baby, honey.

1012
01:20:41,429 --> 01:20:42,972
You take over.

1013
01:21:00,783 --> 01:21:01,649
Let's do it.

1014
01:21:24,850 --> 01:21:26,393
Right on time.

1015
01:21:27,019 --> 01:21:29,261
Punctuality is the soul of good business.

1016
01:21:30,690 --> 01:21:31,805
I like that.

1017
01:21:41,618 --> 01:21:43,077
Check it out if you want.

1018
01:21:54,006 --> 01:21:55,169
Frank.

1019
01:21:55,841 --> 01:21:57,300
Christ, Orin.

1020
01:21:58,803 --> 01:22:00,131
Did you bring anybody?

1021
01:22:00,346 --> 01:22:02,054
I don't know who we can trust.

1022
01:22:03,141 --> 01:22:06,806
I want you to put this on.
You'll need all the protection you can get.

1023
01:22:06,895 --> 01:22:08,306
Let me hold that for you.

1024
01:22:09,022 --> 01:22:11,062
I haven't worn one of these in years.

1025
01:22:12,609 --> 01:22:13,854
Tastes like candy.

1026
01:22:14,861 --> 01:22:16,653
As you can see, we kept our end.

1027
01:22:16,738 --> 01:22:17,983
Now it's your turn.

1028
01:22:18,282 --> 01:22:19,610
Is that the money?

1029
01:22:19,825 --> 01:22:20,940
Half.

1030
01:22:26,874 --> 01:22:27,905
$2.5 million.

1031
01:22:28,417 --> 01:22:29,698
Deal wasn't for half.

1032
01:22:30,002 --> 01:22:31,497
I'm just covering my ass.

1033
01:22:31,587 --> 01:22:34,505
You'll get the rest as soon as
we leave in one piece.

1034
01:22:34,591 --> 01:22:35,789
You have my word.

1035
01:22:35,884 --> 01:22:37,508
Your word is not good enough.

1036
01:22:37,594 --> 01:22:39,218
Looks like we have a problem.

1037
01:22:39,387 --> 01:22:41,131
You'll get your money.

1038
01:22:41,223 --> 01:22:43,346
You got to be sensitive to my situation.

1039
01:22:43,433 --> 01:22:45,141
Half's better than nothing.

1040
01:22:45,352 --> 01:22:49,765
Hold up. Now, listen.
Nobody's trying to fuck anybody here.

1041
01:22:50,357 --> 01:22:51,899
I think you are, Leon.

1042
01:22:55,613 --> 01:22:57,902
- What?
- What was you thinking?

1043
01:22:58,074 --> 01:22:59,734
Where are you going with this?

1044
01:22:59,826 --> 01:23:02,281
I thought you was smarter than this.

1045
01:23:04,247 --> 01:23:05,445
So did I, Strutt.

1046
01:23:06,124 --> 01:23:07,535
Move.

1047
01:23:08,418 --> 01:23:10,327
If it isn't Hou-motherfucking-dini.

1048
01:23:10,420 --> 01:23:13,872
Escaped so many traps,
should be wearing a cape.

1049
01:23:14,091 --> 01:23:16,664
I thought you said
you had this animal on a leash.

1050
01:23:18,971 --> 01:23:21,177
You assholes couldn't keep
your shit together.

1051
01:23:21,265 --> 01:23:23,174
I guess I picked the wrong precinct.

1052
01:23:23,267 --> 01:23:25,390
Look around you. You picked the right.

1053
01:23:25,478 --> 01:23:27,055
Then finish the job.

1054
01:23:27,146 --> 01:23:28,640
Nice friends you got, Boyd.

1055
01:23:30,942 --> 01:23:34,109
Don't give me that look.
I've been on the force too long.

1056
01:23:34,195 --> 01:23:36,521
Laying my life on the line, and for what?

1057
01:23:36,614 --> 01:23:38,109
A lousy $40,000 a year?

1058
01:23:38,283 --> 01:23:39,611
The hell with that!

1059
01:23:39,784 --> 01:23:42,904
You have single-handedly
screwed up my operation.

1060
01:23:43,121 --> 01:23:44,319
It's our operation.

1061
01:23:44,414 --> 01:23:46,787
Let's get it straight. I run this show!

1062
01:23:46,959 --> 01:23:49,117
Not you! Not him! None of you!

1063
01:23:50,129 --> 01:23:51,208
Prove it.

1064
01:23:51,630 --> 01:23:52,544
Kill him.

1065
01:24:13,904 --> 01:24:14,983
Freeze!

1066
01:24:16,782 --> 01:24:18,905
Shit! I'm hit.

1067
01:24:39,848 --> 01:24:42,173
This is your big fucking plan?

1068
01:24:48,232 --> 01:24:49,097
Go.

1069
01:25:00,495 --> 01:25:02,534
I'll get Strutt. Take care of Montini.

1070
01:25:02,622 --> 01:25:03,997
I got that motherfucker.

1071
01:25:06,876 --> 01:25:08,121
Don't leave me here!

1072
01:25:08,336 --> 01:25:09,712
I got you covered.

1073
01:25:13,925 --> 01:25:15,040
You okay, chief?

1074
01:25:16,845 --> 01:25:17,841
Hell, no!

1075
01:25:41,037 --> 01:25:42,117
Boyd, you okay?

1076
01:25:42,581 --> 01:25:44,538
- I don't know.
- I'll check your vest.

1077
01:25:45,375 --> 01:25:47,285
- Didn't go through.
- Good news.

1078
01:26:07,899 --> 01:26:09,097
Damn it!

1079
01:26:31,966 --> 01:26:33,045
Fuck!

1080
01:26:41,893 --> 01:26:42,842
Daniels!

1081
01:26:44,855 --> 01:26:46,017
Where you going?

1082
01:27:00,913 --> 01:27:02,372
You're fired!

1083
01:29:48,966 --> 01:29:51,421
This is Strutt, ready for pickup.

1084
01:30:11,656 --> 01:30:12,901
Go!

1085
01:30:21,375 --> 01:30:22,454
Shake him off!

1086
01:30:27,173 --> 01:30:29,498
You and your brother
can rot in jail together.

1087
01:30:37,475 --> 01:30:39,183
Motherfucker!

1088
01:31:51,804 --> 01:31:52,966
You all right?

1089
01:31:53,055 --> 01:31:55,095
You'll be cleaning up the street soon.

1090
01:31:55,182 --> 01:31:56,890
Then I'll be reading about you.

1091
01:31:56,976 --> 01:31:58,470
I don't know about that.

1092
01:31:59,604 --> 01:32:02,309
Tell them I'm your partner.
They won't let me through!

1093
01:32:02,398 --> 01:32:03,809
Yeah, let him in.

1094
01:32:05,527 --> 01:32:07,982
What happened here?
After all we been through?

1095
01:32:08,071 --> 01:32:11,570
We risk our lives, and I hear
about this on the strippers' scanner.

1096
01:32:11,658 --> 01:32:12,571
Shit!

1097
01:32:12,659 --> 01:32:14,984
Smack my mama on her ass!
That's Henry Wayne!

1098
01:32:15,954 --> 01:32:17,496
Can you do a story on me?

1099
01:32:17,581 --> 01:32:20,997
I was in there.
The cops shot me. I got shot 16 times.

1100
01:32:21,168 --> 01:32:22,579
Does that hurt?

1101
01:32:22,711 --> 01:32:24,503
Yeah! I'm not faking this shit!

1102
01:32:24,588 --> 01:32:28,420
- Could we film your surgery for the show?
- Yeah, you can film my stuff.

1103
01:32:28,509 --> 01:32:30,301
I'm going to be on TV.

1104
01:32:30,386 --> 01:32:32,758
- Can my mama come to the studio?
- You know it.

1105
01:32:32,847 --> 01:32:36,548
Cool. When you want to do it?
We're going to the hospital now.

1106
01:32:36,768 --> 01:32:38,476
- I'll meet you there.
- Okay.

1107
01:32:38,687 --> 01:32:41,604
- Mr. Boyd. Some good work in there.
- Thank you.

1108
01:32:41,857 --> 01:32:44,941
Faster you get rid of dirty cops,
the better for all of us.

1109
01:32:45,027 --> 01:32:46,770
Thanks for making a difference.

1110
01:32:47,738 --> 01:32:50,193
You want your old job back, at two-one...

1111
01:32:50,407 --> 01:32:51,605
...it's all yours.

1112
01:32:51,825 --> 01:32:54,992
No, I think I'll stay here. Right, pard?

1113
01:32:57,164 --> 01:32:58,160
Yeah.

1114
01:32:59,667 --> 01:33:01,743
- You know where to reach me.
- Yes, sir.

1115
01:33:01,878 --> 01:33:03,538
By the way, Mr. Boyd...

1116
01:33:04,297 --> 01:33:05,791
...I fought in Vietnam.

1117
01:33:06,299 --> 01:33:07,710
That don't surprise me.

1118
01:33:11,388 --> 01:33:14,389
- Your buddies are on there.
- Heard about your brother Shaun.

1119
01:33:15,267 --> 01:33:16,975
Hopefully, that'll get him out.

1120
01:33:17,060 --> 01:33:19,137
Think those tapes'll make a difference?

1121
01:33:19,354 --> 01:33:21,312
Courts don't give a shit about this.

1122
01:33:21,398 --> 01:33:23,889
So I had your brother pulled from County.

1123
01:33:24,109 --> 01:33:25,105
Just in case.

1124
01:33:27,113 --> 01:33:28,108
Thank you.

1125
01:33:31,325 --> 01:33:32,736
See you around, partner.

1126
01:33:32,910 --> 01:33:33,942
Thanks a lot.

1127
01:33:34,704 --> 01:33:35,735
You're welcome.

1128
01:33:47,926 --> 01:33:51,675
It's been 30 days since I've been pinched,
punched, scalded or stabbed.

1129
01:33:51,931 --> 01:33:53,341
Well, that's something.

1130
01:33:55,267 --> 01:33:58,103
I'm not gonna pay strippers
to beat me up anymore.

1131
01:33:58,187 --> 01:34:01,687
I'm living in a safe house on Southgate,
if anyone wants to reach me.

1132
01:34:01,774 --> 01:34:04,526
Linda, I'm a changed man
with a lot of problems...

1133
01:34:04,611 --> 01:34:06,484
...so we'll see a lot of each other.

1134
01:34:06,571 --> 01:34:09,358
I've signed up for your shame
and impotence class.

1135
01:34:10,450 --> 01:34:11,779
And these are for you.

1136
01:34:16,456 --> 01:34:18,116
Thank you.

1137
01:34:19,126 --> 01:34:20,454
That's super, Henry.

1138
01:34:22,463 --> 01:34:27,291
So I'd like to proudly acknowledge
our very own hero, Orin Boyd.

1139
01:34:36,144 --> 01:34:39,394
Hey, guys. You need some love. Come on.

1140
01:34:39,814 --> 01:34:41,143
Come on. Group hug.

1141
01:34:41,233 --> 01:34:43,806
Get in here. Come on, everybody.

1142
01:34:44,319 --> 01:34:46,395
We're proud of this man.

1143
01:34:47,030 --> 01:34:48,406
Feels good, don't it?

1144
01:34:49,074 --> 01:34:51,316
Where are we going?
You guys got to stay here.

1145
01:34:53,495 --> 01:34:56,947
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>I'm honored to introduce my new co-host.</i>

1146
01:34:57,166 --> 01:34:59,491
<i>How about a big hand for T.K. Johnson.</i>

1147
01:35:00,169 --> 01:35:01,961
<i>What's up, White Chocolate?</i>

1148
01:35:02,171 --> 01:35:04,662
<i>- Good to see you too.</i>
<i>- All right.</i>

1149
01:35:05,008 --> 01:35:07,713
<i>We got together</i>
<i>when we filmed your surgery...</i>

1150
01:35:07,927 --> 01:35:09,920
<i>... and I've got to tell you something.</i>

1151
01:35:10,013 --> 01:35:13,347
<i>You had the gown on,</i>
<i>and it slipped up, and I'll tell you...</i>

1152
01:35:13,517 --> 01:35:15,344
<i>... it's not true what they say.</i>

1153
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:17,968
<i>Do you like to be called a black man?</i>

1154
01:35:18,188 --> 01:35:20,561
<i>Do you like to be called</i>
<i>an African-American?</i>

1155
01:35:20,649 --> 01:35:22,441
<i>I like to be called T.K., baby.</i>

1156
01:35:22,526 --> 01:35:23,475
<i>Don't label me.</i>

1157
01:35:23,694 --> 01:35:26,316
<i>I mean, what, do you prefer ofay...</i>

1158
01:35:26,530 --> 01:35:28,322
<i>... or do you prefer cracker?</i>

1159
01:35:28,616 --> 01:35:30,359
<i>Redneck? Which one do you like?</i>

1160
01:35:30,451 --> 01:35:32,859
<i>- Cracker's good.</i>
<i>- Hi, Mama.</i>

1161
01:35:32,954 --> 01:35:34,614
<i>- She's out there?</i>
<i>- I love you.</i>

1162
01:35:34,706 --> 01:35:37,161
<i>- Your dad watching?</i>
<i>- Yeah, but he got glaucoma.</i>

1163
01:35:37,333 --> 01:35:40,703
<i>He probably home, smoking a joint.</i>
<i>He can hear me.</i>

1164
01:35:40,921 --> 01:35:43,376
<i>- Good.</i>
<i>- Daddy. Save some for me.</i>

1165
01:35:43,548 --> 01:35:46,466
<i>Save some for me.</i>
<i>Remember, puff, puff, pass.</i>

1166
01:35:46,718 --> 01:35:51,012
<i>Puff, puff, pass. He like to hold on</i>
<i>to the weed sometimes. Because he's old.</i>

1167
01:35:51,223 --> 01:35:52,801
<i>- How old is he?</i>
<i>- He's 48.</i>

1168
01:35:53,058 --> 01:35:55,384
<i>Is Tawana backstage?</i>

1169
01:35:55,603 --> 01:35:58,473
<i>- My nipples are sensitive. Yours?</i>
<i>- Yeah. And huge.</i>

1170
01:35:58,564 --> 01:36:00,106
<i>I always tell women this:</i>

1171
01:36:00,191 --> 01:36:02,729
<i>"If you want it to be over, lick my nipples."</i>

1172
01:36:02,944 --> 01:36:07,321
<i>I like my nipple to be nibbled on</i>
<i>and bit and pulled. I like a little pain.</i>

1173
01:36:07,407 --> 01:36:09,613
<i>I like it too. Very little.</i>

1174
01:36:09,701 --> 01:36:12,737
<i>But they get out of control</i>
<i>and you don't say, "That hurts."</i>

1175
01:36:12,829 --> 01:36:14,869
<i>- But they are.</i>
<i>- I sort of like it.</i>

1176
01:36:16,291 --> 01:36:18,782
<i>Because I'm black,</i>
<i>you say I got to do a B and E?</i>

1177
01:36:19,002 --> 01:36:20,413
<i>No, no, but...</i>

1178
01:36:20,587 --> 01:36:23,079
<i>I pulled your record</i>
<i>before I came over here, too.</i>

1179
01:36:23,257 --> 01:36:25,166
<i>I know what you used to do.</i>

1180
01:36:25,426 --> 01:36:26,422
<i>And I still do.</i>

1181
01:36:26,510 --> 01:36:28,337
<i>- You been with a big woman?</i>
<i>- I have.</i>

1182
01:36:28,429 --> 01:36:29,508
<i>How was that?</i>

1183
01:36:29,597 --> 01:36:32,135
<i>It was fine.</i>

1184
01:36:32,433 --> 01:36:35,138
<i>But I will say this, they're not jolly.</i>

1185
01:36:35,228 --> 01:36:37,019
<i>- They can be cranky.</i>
<i>- Feed them.</i>

1186
01:36:37,105 --> 01:36:39,726
<i>- Now, you like big women?</i>
<i>- I love big women.</i>

1187
01:36:39,816 --> 01:36:42,568
<i>If you want to feel the heat,</i>
<i>you got to have the meat.</i>

1188
01:36:42,652 --> 01:36:43,601
<i>Yeah, baby.</i>

1189
01:36:43,695 --> 01:36:45,902
<i>A big woman good</i>
<i>in the summer and winter.</i>

1190
01:36:45,989 --> 01:36:48,741
<i>Good for shade in summer</i>
<i>and good for warmth in winter.</i>

1191
01:36:48,826 --> 01:36:50,024
<i>You're not masturbating enough.</i>

1192
01:36:50,119 --> 01:36:52,325
<i>- I masturbate two, three times a day.</i>
<i>- Do you?</i>

1193
01:36:52,413 --> 01:36:54,405
<i>I like to do it at the tanning salon.</i>

1194
01:36:54,582 --> 01:36:58,033
<i>- Cause, you are in there...</i>
<i>- At the tanning salon.</i>

1195
01:36:58,127 --> 01:36:59,835
<i>You probably aren't in there.</i>

1196
01:37:00,797 --> 01:37:03,798
<i>But you got to be careful,</i>
<i>because when you're doing it...</i>

1197
01:37:04,008 --> 01:37:07,958
<i>... you can't wear the goggles,</i>
<i>you got to watch the door.</i>

1198
01:37:08,179 --> 01:37:11,299
<i>So you can go blind masturbating actually,</i>
<i>like the old saying.</i>

1199
01:37:14,561 --> 01:37:16,969
<i>Every night, same routine. I get a towel...</i>

1200
01:37:17,189 --> 01:37:21,139
<i>... half damp. On one side, warm water.</i>
<i>Half dry on the other.</i>

1201
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:23,234
<i>Astroglide. Lesbian porn.</i>

1202
01:37:23,320 --> 01:37:24,696
<i>Second only to nature.</i>

1203
01:37:24,780 --> 01:37:27,817
<i>No dicks allowed, number 67 or 69.</i>

1204
01:37:28,034 --> 01:37:30,988
<i>I don't get in trouble.</i>
<i>Clean up, everything's nice.</i>

1205
01:37:31,204 --> 01:37:33,909
<i>Although you can get that</i>
<i>on the remote control.</i>

1206
01:37:34,123 --> 01:37:36,745
<i>When you do a number two,</i>
<i>do you use a handy wipe?</i>

1207
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:40,827
<i>I wipe, then I take a lot of toilet paper</i>
<i>and dip it in water...</i>

1208
01:37:41,006 --> 01:37:43,793
<i>- In the bowl?</i>
<i>- In a clean bowl.</i>

1209
01:37:43,884 --> 01:37:46,090
<i>- That's what I do.</i>
<i>- And then I wipe my ass.</i>

1210
01:37:46,178 --> 01:37:48,669
<i>We're too old to have shit stains</i>
<i>in our drawers.</i>

1211
01:37:48,764 --> 01:37:51,302
<i>Can't be cool</i>
<i>when you got a big-ass shit stain.</i>

1212
01:37:51,392 --> 01:37:53,764
<i>I've not peed the bed since I quit drinking.</i>

1213
01:37:53,853 --> 01:37:56,723
<i>I won a chugging contest before I quit.</i>

1214
01:37:56,814 --> 01:37:59,222
<i>And I not only peed the bed, I shit the bed.</i>

1215
01:37:59,317 --> 01:38:03,362
<i>I was in college. I woke and thought:</i>
<i>"What did my roommate do?"</i>

1216
01:38:04,238 --> 01:38:06,812
<i>And then I went:</i>
<i>"Wait a minute. What did I do?"</i>

1217
01:38:06,908 --> 01:38:09,150
<i>If you have a real problem, get Viagra.</i>

1218
01:38:09,369 --> 01:38:12,405
<i>You don't need a problem for that.</i>
<i>You just go and get it.</i>

1219
01:38:12,497 --> 01:38:14,371
<i>They need to get that for women.</i>

1220
01:38:14,458 --> 01:38:16,581
<i>Well, they would call it Niagara then.</i>

1221
01:38:17,169 --> 01:38:19,126
<i>- You watch Oprah?</i>
<i>- Big or small Oprah?</i>

1222
01:38:19,213 --> 01:38:21,964
<i>I never liked small Oprah</i>
<i>because her head is too big.</i>

1223
01:38:22,049 --> 01:38:25,632
<i>Her head too big for that little body.</i>
<i>Then the eye started to droop.</i>

1224
01:38:26,220 --> 01:38:27,679
<i>Looked like E.T.</i>

1225
01:38:28,097 --> 01:38:30,422
<i>- Oprah, stay big.</i>
<i>- Oprah's great.</i>
