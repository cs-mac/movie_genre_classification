1
00:00:56,122 --> 00:00:57,555
Drink!

2
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:10,861
Starring Choi Min-Sik

3
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:13,529
Ann Sung-Ki

4
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:16,233
Yoo Ho-Jung

00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:19,528
Kim Yuh-Jin, Son Yeah-Jin

6
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:22,842
Director of Photography
Jung II Sung

7
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:55,499
Directed by Im Kwon Taek

8
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:15,358
Here it is, mounted.

9
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,794
What talent!

10
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:24,996
It emanates divine strength,
as if ghosts were dancing around it.

11
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:30,032
He seems to paint by the rules,
yet he doesn't.

12
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:34,406
He follows and breaks them
at the same time.

13
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,143
One stroke is worth ten thousand.
Ten thousand strokes in one!

14
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:42,983
What do rules have to do
with my painting?

15
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,656
Crazy yokel!

16
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:53,092
How can a bumpkin dauber claim
to question the rules of art?

17
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:56,927
You'll waste your life believing
in your paltry talent.

18
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:04,501
In 1882, the Chosun dynasty is ending.

19
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:09,504
The Koreans are rebelling against
foreign invasions and corrupt government.

20
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:15,512
The country is in decline. These were
the days of the artist Jang Seung-ub.

21
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:23,119
We've been expecting you.

22
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:28,625
Mr. Kaiura is Japanese.
He writes for the Hansung Daily.

23
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:33,371
I brought him here because he longs
to own one of your paintings.

24
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:46,781
I admire you.
Your paintings are sublime.

25
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:56,423
He hears you like good drink.
He brought this from Japan.

26
00:04:56,696 --> 00:05:01,724
It's good.
Our diplomats there enjoy it.

27
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:05,403
Thank you for the wine.

28
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:08,740
But do you really want
to take back a painting

29
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:12,333
by a vulgar Korean
to the glorious empire of Japan?

30
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,275
Don't be so arrogant!

31
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:17,744
Many artists would die
for such recognition.

32
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,844
Mr. Kaiura genuinely
admires your work.

33
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:50,010
He knows you're a commoner.
He wonders how you paint so well.

34
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:56,414
My poor friend!
Genius shows, even in a baby!

35
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:03,862
Give me that!
Give me that drawing.

36
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:07,693
You snotnose brat! Get up!

37
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,325
- You there! What are you doing?
- Do you want to die? Filthy brat!

38
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:14,566
- Do you want to die? Filthy brat!
- I said stop!

39
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:32,750
He's the beggars' leader.
She's a girl who takes care of me...

40
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:38,354
like a younger brother.
He never stops hitting her, the beast!

41
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:41,262
He got her pregnant.
He treats her like dirt.

42
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:47,134
I did the drawing to comfort her.
He grabbed me.

43
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:51,705
Father! Seung-ub is running away
with my clothes!

44
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:59,844
Let him go. The rules of a noble
household are too strict for him

45
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:06,388
and he must have realized
we can't afford to feed him.

46
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,560
Where are your rolls of paper?

47
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:17,430
All sold out.
A delivery's due in two days.

48
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:20,404
We're out of stock.

49
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:24,738
If you want writing paper,
we have some Chinese.

50
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:26,436
I'll come back.

51
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:36,513
Master!

52
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:40,825
Is it me you're calling?

53
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:46,398
Aren't you master Kim from Hyoja village?
Don't you recognize me?

54
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:53,236
Once, by Chungye River,
you saved the life of a beggar boy.

55
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:55,541
Seung-ub? Is it you?

56
00:07:56,242 --> 00:08:00,201
What brings you to
this suburban paper shop?

57
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,749
- I moved out here last summer.
- Seung-ub! Where are you?

58
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:10,687
Are those your paintings
on the wall?

59
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:17,692
Yes. I found work with a rotten boss
but I'm glad to have food.

60
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:31,570
Master, please accept my respects.

61
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:37,313
This boy is gifted.
His brushwork has such fire.

62
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:42,750
He may grow up to become
the great artist you longed to be.

63
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,221
Take him as your pupil.

64
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:50,586
Hold the brush as if
you had an egg in your palm.

65
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:53,257
Hold it tight with all five fingers.

66
00:08:53,432 --> 00:09:00,065
From fingers to brush, from brush
to paper, your life force will flow.

67
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,741
First, lay out the "bone structure".

68
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:07,178
Every stroke, structure.

69
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,647
Next, the shading.

70
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:16,719
Shading brings distance
and gives objects their depth.

71
00:09:57,129 --> 00:10:00,223
Three years later.

72
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,525
Is that you, Seung-ub?

73
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:13,976
After barely a year he had a stroke.
He was paralyzed.

74
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:19,776
I kept house and farmed for him.

75
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:24,814
I've come straight from his funeral.

76
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,227
He left me his flute.

77
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:36,666
We'll never be stirred
by his playing again. How sad...

78
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:44,608
The flute was all he left you?

79
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:50,041
He said every painter has to know
literature. Although he was ill,

80
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:56,280
he taught me the classics.
Now my eyes can see.

81
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:59,280
It's been so long.

82
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:03,589
I'd heard you were back from China.
Sorry I took so long to come.

83
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:06,254
Thanks to you, it all went well.

84
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:08,424
I bought this in China.

85
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,200
"The Book of the Measure of Qi".

86
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:15,671
The author is our own Hye-gang.
He's unknown here in his homeland.

87
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:19,711
We spurn the thoughts
of such a sage...

88
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:25,078
while he's admired abroad in China.
Such a pity.

89
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:28,812
What does he say in this book?

90
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:30,945
He explains the mysteries
of the flow of Qi,

91
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:37,586
how it irrigates our five senses
and determines the nation's strength.

92
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:45,994
That would be heresy here.
They'd censor it.

93
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:49,107
That will be our country's downfall.

94
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:55,441
Our ruling class must wake up to the
future. They're asleep. It's disastrous.

95
00:11:56,482 --> 00:12:02,318
I'll share this precious gift
with my reform-minded friends.

96
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:06,988
Introduce yourself.

97
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:13,692
His name is Jang Seung-ub.
I think he has a god-given talent.

98
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,767
Please take him as your servant.

99
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:20,670
Show him original artworks
that will open his eyes.

100
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:37,980
What is it?

101
00:12:56,475 --> 00:13:00,502
The Master's youngest sister.

102
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:05,073
Her frail health worries the family.
Don't go near her.

103
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:09,384
She's a good,
sweet-natured woman

104
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:14,151
but she's always been ill
with an unknown disease.

105
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:49,752
This precious art album comes
from the Chinese royal family.

106
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:04,334
This was painted by Zhao Gan
during the Sung dynasty.

107
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:09,006
He worked at Nanjing
with Tung Yuan.

108
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:13,748
This is by Ma He-zhi,
of the Hangzhou school.

109
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:47,485
On your knees, idler!

110
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:54,121
Everybody works hard here.
You too!

111
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:57,321
Fancy yourself as a painter,
you upstart?

112
00:14:57,463 --> 00:15:02,093
- All you want is a full belly.
- Stop it! Let me go!

113
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:13,905
It's so real, it could tear
through the paper and fly off.

114
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:26,583
You're hurt.

115
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,094
Your hand, too.

116
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:36,161
Such a precious hand...

117
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,855
Hail to the groom!

118
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:08,959
Hail to the bride!

119
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:59,643
Come here, my boy!

120
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:09,422
I've never shown anyone
this painting by Chen Jia-yan.

121
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:12,591
How did you contrive to copy it?

122
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:17,965
I looked at it once... in secret.

123
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:26,671
I'm harboring a thief in my home.

124
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:31,945
Compare the two.
Can you tell which is the original?

125
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:35,316
He painted it after looking at it once.

126
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:40,154
Only the seal is missing.
Otherwise, they're identical.

127
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,225
But, even more amazing than

128
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:46,320
the copying look at that vivacity!

129
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:50,832
His gifts of observation
and memory are staggering.

130
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:58,170
There are two birds in the original
but three in the copy.

131
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:02,637
It looks so lonely and dismal.
Here's a long-lost friend!

132
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:17,923
Not so long, damn it!

133
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:22,091
Don't you recognize me?

134
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:26,604
I heard you were working
for a herbalist

135
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:29,469
and now you're
in Master Lee's employ.

136
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:33,671
I've been drifting around
for a while.

137
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:39,176
- Bring me some wine.
- Coming up! Bring him wine!

138
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:45,351
- Who are you?
- She's my daughter. Go to bed.

139
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:52,159
They say you made a perfect copy
of a Chinese painting...

140
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:57,360
you'd seen only once.
So you're Jang Seung-ub?

141
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:01,071
I'm meeting a genius. Delighted.

142
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:06,433
My name is Oh Cheon-suk.
I'm an art dealer.

143
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:09,911
I'm buying. Bring him food.

144
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:14,413
These are copies of erotica.

145
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:22,520
That's what sells best these days.

146
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:27,289
Even famous artists like Danwon
and Hyewon have done some.

147
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:31,869
After all, pornography
is a part of life.

148
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:36,974
I'll wait until I'm famous, then.

149
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:40,772
Nonsense! Chinese imitations
are unfashionable.

150
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:46,407
If you paint what doesn't sell,
who'll pay for your rice and wine?

151
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:49,748
So why look at them?

152
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:57,195
- Choon-sim, come in.
- Go away.

153
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:07,265
His talent is in your hands.
Be good to him!

154
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,575
Why are you trembling?

155
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:17,479
It seems like your first time.
Let me show you.

156
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:47,209
Mister, this isn't me.
It doesn't look like me.

157
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:30,284
I hear that copies of my collection
are circulating. You must be the culprit.

158
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:38,659
You should be studying till your fingers
bleed. Will you waste your life forever?

159
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,747
This is the Footbridge Art School.

160
00:21:56,948 --> 00:22:01,681
Painters and scholars study here,
so behave yourself.

161
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,290
Master Hyesan,
please accept him as your pupil.

162
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:16,990
He hasn't studied long but
his genius should not be wasted.

163
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:26,074
So you're the one who copied
all those Chinese paintings.

164
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:32,374
Let's go in.

165
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:35,579
Welcome. Please go upstairs.

166
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:40,454
A bankrupt merchant opened this tavern.
It does good business.

167
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,494
This is Mongam.

168
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:48,764
And this young man is Doncho.

169
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:55,372
My name is Songhyun.
I mostly paint "Bird and Flower".

170
00:22:58,243 --> 00:23:01,906
You know Su Tung-po,
the great painter and poet?

171
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:07,484
He argues that depicting nature
as it is doesn't make it art.

172
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:12,887
Painting must reflect
the painter's mind.

173
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:15,926
It's rough for daubers like us!

174
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,859
Paint the thoughts behind the shape...

175
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:24,726
Go beyond the form
and paint the meaning.

176
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:29,699
It's our Master's motto:
"Think before you paint."

177
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:34,742
As his pupil,
you'll have to work hard.

178
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:42,743
Depth and shadow
must always be equal.

179
00:23:42,954 --> 00:23:46,355
Is that a mouse or a rabbit?

180
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:51,220
Object and painting must be as one.
Why these slapdash strokes?

181
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:55,526
Don't push the brush. Pull it!

182
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:58,569
"Homecoming."

183
00:23:59,237 --> 00:24:04,675
Painting is about more than appearance.
It's about capturing the essence.

184
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:11,305
See the difference?

185
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:18,556
You painted a scholar
gazing blissfully at flowers.

186
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:27,793
Here, what feeling do you get from
this man's face and the scenery?

187
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:35,436
His employer asked him for a bribe.
He refused and lost the job which...

188
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:40,634
he'd only just found. Tao Yuan-ming's
sorrow has to show through.

189
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:46,213
Can't you see him yearning
to express his pain in a poem?

190
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:50,382
Imagination must breathe fire
into the painting.

191
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:56,023
More important than the strokes
is what lies between them.

192
00:24:57,429 --> 00:25:01,627
The mind's discipline alone
must guide the brush.

193
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:14,107
Master, I've finished "Homecoming".

194
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,876
How dare you claim it's finished?

195
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:21,315
A painting is never finished.

196
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,327
I want you to paint this fan.

197
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:31,793
It's a gift for a Chinese dignitary.

198
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:36,197
I asked Master Hyesan to paint it,
but he referred me to you.

199
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:40,462
He did? He really recommended me?

200
00:25:42,774 --> 00:25:50,874
Let us be merry
while we are young.

201
00:25:51,016 --> 00:26:01,256
When we are old
it will be too late.

202
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:12,392
Seung-ub, this party's for you.
Join in!

203
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:14,301
Come closer.

204
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:17,136
Sit here.

205
00:26:24,883 --> 00:26:30,185
Thanks to your painting,
my trip went well. Take this.

206
00:26:31,222 --> 00:26:35,852
A gift from the Chinese dignitary
to the painter of the fan.

207
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:38,118
It's a special stone for a seal.

208
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:42,063
Here's a new girl.
She plays the 'saenghwang' well.

209
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,575
My name's Mae-hyang.

210
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:57,312
Our Seung-ub plays
the flute very well.

211
00:26:57,749 --> 00:27:01,048
They'll make a perfect duet.

212
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,772
"The plum blossom
blooms only for thee."

213
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:19,694
They say it keeps its scent to itself.
I'm ashamed of what I am.

214
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:28,634
In 1866, Regent Daewon orders
the persecution of the Catholics.

215
00:28:28,673 --> 00:28:32,541
Nine French missionaries
and 8,000 Koreans are beheaded.

216
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:54,020
Are you looking for someone, too?

217
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:58,798
Yes. I know a kisaeng,
Mae-hyang, who's a Catholic.

218
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:04,398
You used to say
we're all equal before God.

219
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:09,139
You wanted to abolish
inequality in Korea

220
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:12,038
but you're leaving,
abandoning your dreams.

221
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:35,506
Very cute!

222
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:38,542
You've beautifully captured
the languid eyes

223
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:42,010
of this idle dog
as he watches the bee.

224
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,510
Seung-ub.

225
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:50,854
Master Lee wants you urgently.

226
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:56,819
So-woon has returned.

227
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:59,259
She has no hope of recovery.

228
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:02,991
She came back to avoid
being a burden on her husband.

229
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:06,897
I sent for you because she longs
to have a painting by you.

230
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:13,307
Think of it as her last wish.
Do it for me.

231
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,587
Seung-ub is here.

232
00:30:43,374 --> 00:30:45,239
What shall I paint for you?

233
00:30:48,246 --> 00:30:51,807
Whatever inspires you.

234
00:31:13,938 --> 00:31:17,101
Here it is.

235
00:31:52,377 --> 00:32:10,126
This is a farewell.

236
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:28,704
This is a farewell.

237
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:59,472
Farewell to my love.

238
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:32,604
If you must leave
tell me when you'll return.

239
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:40,376
Three famous painters
have jae in their names.

240
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:45,687
You could be the third won
with Danwon and Hyewon.

241
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,681
Choose a forename.

242
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:58,125
Oh, meaning "I".

243
00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:02,599
"I too am a Won."
Forceful Chinese art is all very well...

244
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:08,037
but you must see the works that
contain the spirit of our ancestors.

245
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:12,838
The master of this house
never shows his collection

246
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:16,952
but I'm a relative.
He won't say no.

247
00:34:18,089 --> 00:34:20,387
He's fond of pine mushrooms.

248
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:25,122
What can I get you?

249
00:34:27,198 --> 00:34:29,063
He's in the main wing.

250
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,866
- Wait for me here.
- Yes, master.

251
00:34:50,354 --> 00:34:52,083
You, get out!

252
00:34:52,457 --> 00:34:56,018
Watch where you put
your dirty backside!

253
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:58,789
- Beat it!
- What's happening?

254
00:34:58,896 --> 00:35:04,027
This uncouth dauber
just sat himself down!

255
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:07,830
The famous "Winter Pine Tree"
by Chusa.

256
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:14,378
No trace of affectation.
The tree's pure thrust in a winter sky.

257
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:17,070
A masterpiece which reflects
the painter's nobility.

258
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:20,976
"Come the chill of winter,
the pine's green turns to emerald."

259
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:25,188
"The more chaotic the world,
the happier is the man of virtue."

260
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:28,151
The teachings of Confucius.

261
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:33,490
How can an unschooled painter create
masterpieces through technique alone?

262
00:35:34,365 --> 00:35:39,268
Painting is the expression
of knowledge.

263
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:47,204
A new day dawns but the world
still wanders in darkness.

264
00:35:47,545 --> 00:35:50,036
Chusa has reached a higher level

265
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:53,808
but, steeped in Chinese culture,
he's lost touch with our soil.

266
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:59,983
He studied with a Chinese master.

267
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:03,819
He adopted the style
of the Han dynasty.

268
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:11,366
Create your own style with
painting alone, without words.

269
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,208
Are you still angry?

270
00:36:20,444 --> 00:36:22,344
Let's go for a drink.

271
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:32,416
Good evening.

272
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:41,665
Go to the bedroom.

273
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:43,700
Bring me some drink.

274
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:52,200
Go to bed.

275
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:55,344
Bring me some drink.

276
00:36:57,815 --> 00:36:59,544
You, come here.

277
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,713
Get me some drink.

278
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,788
You're already drunk.

279
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:11,119
Son of a dog! Guttersnipe!

280
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:15,222
I saved your life and you disobey me?
Get me some alcohol, dog!

281
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,591
Move! Son of a dog!

282
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:35,351
The fragrance of letters? The harmony
of poetry, prose and painting?

283
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:40,256
If that's what they want.

284
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:45,927
Screw them! If it doesn't have words,
it's not painting?

285
00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:53,095
Real painting speaks by itself.
No need for words.

286
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:57,768
Only daubers
add poems to their work,

287
00:37:57,842 --> 00:38:03,474
trying to fool people with
their bogus philosophy. Frauds!

288
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:10,179
No more drink.

289
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:25,998
Get up! Get some more drink!

290
00:38:51,028 --> 00:38:55,727
Light the candle.
Mix me some ink.

291
00:40:10,107 --> 00:40:13,770
You! Get up!

292
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:18,446
Let's go out for some beef soup.

293
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:25,983
The layabout's still asleep?
Wake up!

294
00:40:26,857 --> 00:40:28,449
What?

295
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:32,624
What's that?

296
00:40:40,504 --> 00:40:42,631
Wake up.

297
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:46,376
I said wake up!

298
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:49,110
Was somebody here last night?

299
00:40:49,246 --> 00:40:52,511
How should I know?
I was asleep.

300
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:58,445
Was somebody here?

301
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:02,854
Was it Pyeong-san?

302
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:07,397
Pyeong-san?

303
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:10,195
The dauber you used to live with!

304
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:19,203
What about Pyeong-san?
What's wrong with Pyeong-san?

305
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:24,403
I must have painted
with my fingers.

306
00:41:41,765 --> 00:41:46,464
You're a bastard. I lived with
Pyeong-san and with Gi-san, too.

307
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:49,437
What's wrong if a kisaeng
sleeps with other men?

308
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:53,509
I don't live with you just for sex.

309
00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:57,274
I like you for your innocence.

310
00:41:57,414 --> 00:41:59,314
But I'm crazy!

311
00:41:59,383 --> 00:42:02,875
Crazy to rent this house
and live with you.

312
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:06,717
You stinker! What have you ever
done for me?

313
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:10,691
All you do is drink
all the money you earn!

314
00:42:10,761 --> 00:42:14,094
You paint a fish on the wall
but you wouldn't buy a wardrobe.

315
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:18,032
Do you care how we get food?

316
00:42:19,637 --> 00:42:24,040
Don't expect me to cry when you leave!
This isn't the first time.

317
00:42:24,508 --> 00:42:27,739
All right, leave! I'm not afraid.

318
00:42:37,254 --> 00:42:39,779
Why are you following me?
Go home!

319
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:54,660
Mongrel!

320
00:42:55,306 --> 00:42:59,868
Does learning to paint
have to be so painful?

321
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:41,073
Go to hell!
I'm sick of this.

322
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:43,676
Elsewhere, one painting buys lunch,
another one dinner.

323
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:47,279
The aristocrats here
don't even look.

324
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:50,419
They must have good taste!

325
00:43:51,562 --> 00:43:56,295
At a glance,
they can see it's rubbish.

326
00:43:56,467 --> 00:44:00,927
They say it's muddy.

327
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:04,040
This kind of painting is for plebs.

328
00:44:10,781 --> 00:44:12,544
This one would sell.

329
00:44:15,686 --> 00:44:17,677
Don't! It's good!

330
00:44:17,788 --> 00:44:19,722
Dirty brat! Go to hell!

331
00:44:22,192 --> 00:44:23,921
Dirty brat!

332
00:44:59,663 --> 00:45:05,624
Master! Master!

333
00:45:05,736 --> 00:45:09,900
Let's run!
The farmer's after me!

334
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:11,635
Wretched thief!

335
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:14,173
Who told you to steal?

336
00:45:14,244 --> 00:45:17,111
Did you learn it
from your beggar friends?

337
00:45:17,181 --> 00:45:20,275
Bad habits like that
are hard to lose.

338
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,800
- Here.
- You eat it.

339
00:45:39,703 --> 00:45:42,263
I'll eat the head and neck.

340
00:45:43,107 --> 00:45:44,904
Eat it, mongrel.

341
00:46:05,462 --> 00:46:10,490
When did we last eat meat?

342
00:46:21,178 --> 00:46:22,975
Master!

343
00:46:25,015 --> 00:46:27,279
We must part here.

344
00:46:28,051 --> 00:46:30,713
Part? Why?

345
00:46:33,757 --> 00:46:37,887
It's too hard.
I can't keep up with you.

346
00:46:38,095 --> 00:46:40,859
You're an orphan.

347
00:46:40,931 --> 00:46:42,660
Where will you go?

348
00:46:42,733 --> 00:46:48,000
I have a distant uncle in my village.
I'll work on his farm.

349
00:46:50,674 --> 00:46:52,266
Go, then!

350
00:47:18,936 --> 00:47:22,235
That chest costs
as much as a house.

351
00:47:22,372 --> 00:47:26,206
A famous craftsman
took six months to make it.

352
00:48:25,202 --> 00:48:27,102
Come out!

353
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:31,739
I said come out, you bitch!

354
00:48:53,697 --> 00:48:55,062
Drink.

355
00:48:57,067 --> 00:48:58,830
Drink, you slut!

356
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:13,912
Who was it?

357
00:49:18,588 --> 00:49:20,180
Pyeong-san.

358
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:26,090
He told me to stop waiting for you
and move in with him.

359
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:30,660
I'm a young woman.
Should I live like a widow

360
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:33,031
while every passing girl, you...

361
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:34,537
Whore!

362
00:49:37,407 --> 00:49:40,376
Why Pyeong-san, bitch?

363
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:45,272
I'm through with you.

364
00:49:49,186 --> 00:49:51,586
Let go of me, bitch!

365
00:49:52,556 --> 00:49:57,459
I know it's my fault.
I'm not pleading with you to stay

366
00:49:57,561 --> 00:49:59,529
but you can't just walk out!

367
00:49:59,596 --> 00:50:02,190
It's over!
What more do you want?

368
00:50:03,767 --> 00:50:06,133
Do a painting for me, at least.

369
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:08,965
All right, I will.

370
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:11,835
What will you paint?

371
00:50:12,642 --> 00:50:17,238
A Bird and Flower picture
will be ample for you.

372
00:50:17,447 --> 00:50:20,348
Bird and Flower?

373
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:24,783
If we split up, I want something
that's worth money.

374
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:29,318
What kind of picture
is worth money?

375
00:52:06,523 --> 00:52:10,857
Such a beautiful painting
for a floozy...

376
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:13,987
For a kisaeng,
she was faithful to him.

377
00:52:14,097 --> 00:52:18,500
She must have suffered,
living with that madman.

378
00:52:18,568 --> 00:52:22,095
If she was so faithful,
why did she sell it so fast?

379
00:52:22,205 --> 00:52:23,672
It's magnificent.

380
00:52:23,907 --> 00:52:27,866
His greatest work yet.

381
00:52:28,111 --> 00:52:31,547
What's this screen
that everyone's talking about?

382
00:52:31,681 --> 00:52:33,615
I'd like to see it, at least.

383
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:38,949
The screen isn't all. There's the
painting by him in Minister Min's house

384
00:52:39,256 --> 00:52:43,056
and the one that Hwang
the millionaire bought.

385
00:52:43,293 --> 00:52:45,887
If it's by him, it can't be bad.

386
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:49,396
He copied Guo Xi's trees,

387
00:52:49,533 --> 00:52:54,493
Huang Gong-wang's rocks
and Lin Liang's flowers and birds.

388
00:52:54,571 --> 00:52:58,871
There's no harm in borrowing
from the great masters.

389
00:52:59,643 --> 00:53:04,046
Capturing the essence of classics
takes talent, too.

390
00:53:04,981 --> 00:53:07,347
Does alcohol make you envious?

391
00:53:07,484 --> 00:53:11,511
Master Hyesan sent for you.

392
00:53:19,296 --> 00:53:22,356
Master Hyesan, here,
painted the late king twice

393
00:53:22,566 --> 00:53:27,333
and his majesty's portrait
last year.

394
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:29,729
Dongchun.

395
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:32,402
Unhnong.

396
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:35,971
Ohwon, alias Jang Seung-ub.

397
00:53:37,581 --> 00:53:40,345
I've heard of you.
I've seen your work.

398
00:54:27,397 --> 00:54:31,857
To celebrate
the Governor's birthday,

399
00:54:32,135 --> 00:54:37,368
our chosen theme shall be
"Pine and Crane" to wish him long life.

400
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:39,337
"Pine and Crane" it is.

401
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:41,205
No, a "Gakwan Jinjak".

402
00:54:41,311 --> 00:54:43,779
I want Ohwon to begin it.

403
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:46,178
The Governor requests
a "Gakwan Jinjak".

404
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:50,344
- Ohwon.
- Yes, sir

405
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:52,411
You go first.

406
00:54:53,423 --> 00:54:59,362
How dare I go
before Master Hyesan?

407
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:01,896
It's the Governor's order.

408
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:46,100
Father, what's a "Gakwan Jinjak"?

409
00:55:46,209 --> 00:55:50,543
It means "Next to the Crown",

410
00:55:50,647 --> 00:55:54,811
a wish for the highest rank,
just below the king.

411
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:10,026
Master Hyesan's turn is next.

412
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:18,265
A painting is made of arteries.

413
00:56:18,408 --> 00:56:22,936
You took the heart.
How will the Master react?

414
00:56:44,601 --> 00:56:47,434
The peony signifies
wealth and fame.

415
00:56:50,607 --> 00:56:54,566
The peach, celestial fruit,
symbolizes long life.

416
00:56:55,044 --> 00:56:58,707
The crab shell signifies
selection for State office.

417
00:56:58,882 --> 00:57:04,684
The crab knows the art of retreat.
A man must know when to withdraw.

418
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:37,814
Is the Master in?

419
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:40,783
Isn't he well?

420
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:47,093
- Are you all right?
- Don't come up!

421
00:57:47,664 --> 00:57:50,155
How dare you soil this threshold?

422
00:57:50,767 --> 00:57:53,759
Master Hyesan has resigned
from the school.

423
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:59,033
Even on the Governor's order,
you should have refused three times.

424
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:02,611
You dared to paint
before the Master!

425
00:58:03,112 --> 00:58:06,240
People who don't respect rank
are worse than animals.

426
00:58:06,683 --> 00:58:09,151
You betrayed your fellows' trust.

427
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:13,551
You disgraced your Master.
Don't ever come back here.

428
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:21,262
He refuses to see you.
Go away.

429
00:58:27,904 --> 00:58:32,637
Get up.
You don't need my forgiveness.

430
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:39,410
This merely proves that your talent
is more admired than mine.

431
00:58:41,484 --> 00:58:47,354
The blue extracted from indigo is
more beautiful than the indigo itself.

432
00:58:49,225 --> 00:58:54,128
But without the indigo, there
would be no blue. Likewise, you...

433
00:58:54,931 --> 00:59:04,966
You must set the example for future
sons of our land. Be like the indigo.

434
00:59:06,609 --> 00:59:09,442
Mae-hyang,
Master Ohwon sent for you.

435
00:59:23,426 --> 00:59:28,056
After you disappeared, I searched
for you everywhere in vain.

436
00:59:29,799 --> 00:59:32,563
I made this long journey
to see you again.

437
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:39,432
It was dangerous to stay in Seoul.
I roamed around before coming here.

438
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:43,105
Will you soon go back to Seoul?

439
00:59:43,813 --> 00:59:49,274
I have many orders for paintings.
I'll stay at least a month.

440
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:59,459
Do you have a lover?

441
01:00:07,403 --> 01:00:14,036
This place is notorious for
its idle nobles and corrupt officials.

442
01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:38,066
When I look at your work,
I forget all worldly cares. It's strange...

443
01:00:39,102 --> 01:00:46,804
Giving solace through painting and
taking solace in it is the artist's lot.

444
01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:49,408
Why don't we live together?

445
01:00:50,446 --> 01:00:53,347
We have nothing to lose.

446
01:00:53,583 --> 01:00:58,077
If I'm caught, they'll kill me
and you want to live with me?

447
01:00:58,888 --> 01:01:00,753
Are you at risk here?

448
01:01:02,859 --> 01:01:06,955
An official seems to suspect me.
He's getting pushy.

449
01:01:07,797 --> 01:01:10,857
It's time I went away.

450
01:01:15,204 --> 01:01:19,231
The composition...
and structure are good.

451
01:01:19,976 --> 01:01:23,503
The harmony of colors
is accomplished.

452
01:01:24,247 --> 01:01:30,948
The likeness of the rendering...
Your skill is faultless.

453
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:35,415
Nonetheless, it's time
you created paintings of your own,

454
01:01:35,958 --> 01:01:38,620
infused with your spirit and soul.

455
01:01:41,297 --> 01:01:43,822
I know. I want to change.

456
01:01:44,133 --> 01:01:47,000
I really want to change!

457
01:01:49,472 --> 01:01:53,772
I often wake up at night,
haunted by it.

458
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:58,073
It churns my blood.

459
01:02:02,919 --> 01:02:06,082
So often, having to paint to order,

460
01:02:06,155 --> 01:02:09,386
- I feel...
- You drop your brush

461
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:14,989
and run away whenever you don't
like what you're painting.

462
01:02:16,432 --> 01:02:19,629
How can you make
such a feeble excuse?

463
01:02:20,203 --> 01:02:27,871
A picture that's painted for profit and
instant fame is nothing but vanity. Stillborn!

464
01:02:46,062 --> 01:02:50,089
- Filthy dog!
- What's got into you?

465
01:02:50,233 --> 01:02:53,134
He only asked why
you've stopped painting!

466
01:02:53,236 --> 01:02:57,696
Leave me alone! Filthy shrew!

467
01:03:02,645 --> 01:03:05,045
What are you idiots staring at?

468
01:03:25,768 --> 01:03:29,363
You wretched fools!

469
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:33,173
Jang Seung-ub!
You'll break the tiles.

470
01:03:33,276 --> 01:03:36,336
I'd climb roofs too
if talent grew there.

471
01:03:53,462 --> 01:03:55,327
You came back!

472
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:58,956
Give me some wine
and grill him some beef.

473
01:03:59,235 --> 01:04:03,865
The money you advanced
me is spent.

474
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:08,136
Stingy bitch! Why talk about money?
Give me a drink.

475
01:04:08,211 --> 01:04:10,975
- This isn't a charity!
- Stingy bitch!

476
01:04:19,222 --> 01:04:21,349
So why are you here?

477
01:04:25,595 --> 01:04:27,062
Stay with me.

478
01:04:28,998 --> 01:04:32,695
I'll stay for the winter
but I'll leave in the spring.

479
01:04:33,569 --> 01:04:37,198
Sir, I know you'll be angry but...

480
01:04:37,573 --> 01:04:39,564
I'd like a painting of yours.
Even a dud one.

481
01:04:41,611 --> 01:04:45,069
I'll treasure it and think of you.

482
01:04:46,082 --> 01:04:49,813
Since I gave up painting,
I don't even have a dud one.

483
01:04:50,419 --> 01:04:51,716
Why?

484
01:04:56,592 --> 01:04:58,184
I want to change.

485
01:04:58,461 --> 01:05:04,024
Whatever the genre, your brush
makes a masterpiece of everything.

486
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:06,360
Why do you want to change?

487
01:05:06,402 --> 01:05:09,064
People find in my pictures
what they expect.

488
01:05:11,007 --> 01:05:13,066
I must get away from that.

489
01:05:13,976 --> 01:05:17,912
If I don't, I'll always be
their prisoner.

490
01:06:13,169 --> 01:06:16,627
- "No more paper on credit," he says.
- What?

491
01:06:17,239 --> 01:06:19,207
Have some stewed pumpkin.

492
01:06:19,342 --> 01:06:22,607
That man Cho is such a bandit!
I'll break his...

493
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:05,586
"Hawk in full vigor."

494
01:07:05,755 --> 01:07:10,419
His brush never wavers.
It's quite outstanding.

495
01:07:11,494 --> 01:07:13,587
He has renewed himself.

496
01:07:13,996 --> 01:07:20,868
With such a painting, he could
buy himself a beautiful house.

497
01:07:45,294 --> 01:07:49,492
You never signed your work before.

498
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:56,303
If a boy like you shows this around

499
01:07:56,372 --> 01:07:59,205
who will ever believe I painted it?

500
01:08:00,042 --> 01:08:01,771
Take it.

501
01:08:04,713 --> 01:08:06,442
Take it, I said!

502
01:08:30,806 --> 01:08:33,775
Somewhere in Choungchung Province,

503
01:08:33,843 --> 01:08:36,505
a young man had
one of your hawk paintings.

504
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:42,274
The hawk's eye was so lifelike,
I wanted to buy it

505
01:08:42,518 --> 01:08:47,319
but he said he wouldn't sell it
until the sea ran dry.

506
01:08:48,190 --> 01:08:52,024
Could you paint that hawk for me?

507
01:09:11,881 --> 01:09:14,941
Where did you meet this young man?

508
01:09:15,317 --> 01:09:19,515
He had a small stand selling paper
at Boeun market.

509
01:09:24,059 --> 01:09:25,924
"Hawk in full vigor..."

510
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:30,230
If it's the one
I remember, I suppose I could.

511
01:09:32,801 --> 01:09:39,036
In those days my brush was guided,
not by me, but by a divine force.

512
01:09:41,744 --> 01:09:43,575
The Master is here.

513
01:09:49,151 --> 01:09:50,948
Come here and look.

514
01:09:54,423 --> 01:09:59,861
That black stone.
Is it moving or not?

515
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:04,693
A humble stone must be alive
in a painter's eyes.

516
01:10:05,568 --> 01:10:10,699
If a stone is alive, it's dynamic.
If it's dead, it's static.

517
01:10:12,308 --> 01:10:16,108
You can't paint a dead stone.

518
01:10:19,848 --> 01:10:22,339
Pan-soi. Come and look.

519
01:10:26,255 --> 01:10:32,455
Look at it. The rare Mookchong stone,
as blue as ink.

520
01:10:33,529 --> 01:10:37,192
As plump as one of our mountains.

521
01:10:38,367 --> 01:10:42,235
That stone was a gift to you.
You ought to get working.

522
01:10:42,705 --> 01:10:46,197
Gifts are piling up,
waiting for your paintings.

523
01:10:46,408 --> 01:10:50,538
You've done nothing for a month.
I'm tired of this!

524
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:53,814
Come here.

525
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:57,712
You're only a kid.
To paint, you need desire.

526
01:10:57,886 --> 01:10:59,979
How can I paint
without an erection?

527
01:11:00,222 --> 01:11:02,383
Ohwon, are you there?

528
01:11:07,129 --> 01:11:11,759
You remember that scholar
who asked for a still life and then...

529
01:11:12,534 --> 01:11:16,368
- wanted a Flower and Bird picture?
- What about him?

530
01:11:16,472 --> 01:11:23,844
Now he says he doesn't want
that either. He wants a landscape.

531
01:11:24,647 --> 01:11:26,979
Who is this chap?

532
01:11:30,052 --> 01:11:33,351
Would it be Gwak Sung-min?

533
01:11:35,057 --> 01:11:36,615
Am I right?

534
01:11:38,627 --> 01:11:43,462
I've come to see Gwak Sung-min.
Tell him Ohwon is here.

535
01:11:44,033 --> 01:11:46,900
A man like you an aristocrat and scholar!

536
01:11:47,036 --> 01:11:48,936
How can you be such a coward?

537
01:11:49,038 --> 01:11:51,438
If you want something, ask me!

538
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:55,340
Don't make me paint it
just so you can copy it!

539
01:11:57,046 --> 01:12:01,949
I used this ruse in order to meet you.
Please forgive me.

540
01:12:02,851 --> 01:12:04,842
Come in, please.

541
01:12:05,487 --> 01:12:10,117
Hey, Ohwon. When it comes to
portraits, I am unrivaled

542
01:12:10,259 --> 01:12:13,422
but your masterful brushwork
is beyond me.

543
01:12:13,529 --> 01:12:16,589
I'm no match for you
at portraiture.

544
01:12:18,067 --> 01:12:19,864
Listen, Ohwon.

545
01:12:22,471 --> 01:12:28,432
In your Banana Leaf painting with
a few strokes, you captured the fullness

546
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:31,911
of the leaf and
the emptiness of the stalk.

547
01:12:32,247 --> 01:12:34,841
How do you work?

548
01:12:36,051 --> 01:12:40,647
Idiot! One little binge
and you cling to my ass.

549
01:12:41,523 --> 01:12:44,549
If you want to paint,
first learn how to drink.

550
01:12:47,429 --> 01:12:50,125
Get in there! Idiot!

551
01:12:53,102 --> 01:12:54,831
Get in there! Hurry up!

552
01:13:13,822 --> 01:13:15,619
- Pan-soi!
- Yes, sir.

553
01:13:16,358 --> 01:13:18,292
Where's my Double Horse painting?

554
01:13:18,627 --> 01:13:20,618
At the gallery.

555
01:13:21,597 --> 01:13:25,055
Already?
I said I was going to rework it.

556
01:13:26,034 --> 01:13:27,899
You didn't tell me.

557
01:13:36,345 --> 01:13:38,245
Where's my Double Horse?

558
01:13:38,547 --> 01:13:41,573
It's been mounted. Over there.

559
01:13:49,024 --> 01:13:54,326
Chinese soldiers are weaklings.
Japanese soldiers are tough!

560
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:56,125
Are you there?

561
01:13:56,231 --> 01:13:58,961
I'm asking it back to rework it.

562
01:13:59,067 --> 01:14:02,798
You can't.
Lord Kim is impatient to see it.

563
01:14:02,905 --> 01:14:06,341
I promised him
I'd deliver it in five days.

564
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:23,190
What a temper!
It did seem hastily done.

565
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:25,123
It wasn't bad.

566
01:14:27,429 --> 01:14:30,057
The best quality,
imported from China.

567
01:14:33,669 --> 01:14:35,967
It's a beautiful color.

568
01:14:40,709 --> 01:14:43,337
For the same price,
how about this color?

569
01:14:45,247 --> 01:14:46,942
I'll come back later.

570
01:14:47,049 --> 01:14:49,040
Don't go away!

571
01:14:51,620 --> 01:14:53,986
Aren't they pretty!

572
01:14:54,189 --> 01:14:56,783
They're the new kisaengs
from Spring Branch lounge.

573
01:15:07,936 --> 01:15:11,702
Make way! Make way!

574
01:15:11,874 --> 01:15:15,105
Make way for
Minister Min's procession!

575
01:15:15,577 --> 01:15:18,705
You! What impudence!

576
01:15:19,481 --> 01:15:21,972
How dare you remain standing?

577
01:15:24,553 --> 01:15:26,521
Who is it?

578
01:15:28,123 --> 01:15:31,559
The famous painter,
Ohwon Jang Seung-ub.

579
01:15:32,427 --> 01:15:36,557
Famed for your meager talent,
now you defy the law.

580
01:15:43,505 --> 01:15:47,805
Master, this one-year-old
baby's urine...

581
01:15:48,176 --> 01:15:51,236
is a very good cure
for bruises from beatings.

582
01:15:51,847 --> 01:15:55,112
- Drink it yourself!
- Anybody in?

583
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:00,847
Look after yourself.

584
01:16:01,156 --> 01:16:04,489
- Everything went well.
- Is that so?

585
01:16:05,227 --> 01:16:06,854
How?

586
01:16:06,962 --> 01:16:10,090
You can accomplish
anything you want.

587
01:16:10,232 --> 01:16:15,568
The lounge mistress wants you to paint
her a twelve-panel Flower & Bird screen.

588
01:16:18,407 --> 01:16:21,308
It's a good month's work.

589
01:16:22,544 --> 01:16:27,880
Everyone congratulates me on this
wonderful screen. I sent for her.

590
01:16:44,232 --> 01:16:47,724
Delighted to meet you.
My name is Hyang-lan.

591
01:16:49,438 --> 01:16:54,398
They say you drink a lot.
Why won't you drink today?

592
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:07,021
Hyang-lan...
What's your real name?

593
01:17:10,726 --> 01:17:17,154
My family name is Cho. My given
name is Hyo-in, "filial and generous".

594
01:17:17,366 --> 01:17:20,563
Hyo-in, I once knew a woman
very much like you.

595
01:17:21,336 --> 01:17:23,361
Her family name was Lee.

596
01:17:24,206 --> 01:17:26,572
How old are you?

597
01:17:28,977 --> 01:17:30,808
Eighteen.

598
01:17:32,047 --> 01:17:34,880
Eighteen. Eighteen.

599
01:17:35,050 --> 01:17:37,450
What do your parents do?

600
01:17:38,987 --> 01:17:41,820
They're ordinary peasants
in the hills.

601
01:17:48,397 --> 01:17:52,993
And you, what brought you here?

602
01:17:53,068 --> 01:17:57,300
Don't ask unnecessary questions.
Let's go to bed.

603
01:17:58,740 --> 01:18:02,540
I've had a long, tiresome night.

604
01:18:17,526 --> 01:18:19,926
Ohwon! There you are.

605
01:18:21,363 --> 01:18:25,595
This is Ohwon Jang Seung-ub,
the artist. Let me introduce you.

606
01:18:27,035 --> 01:18:32,473
This is Kim Ok-kyun,
scourge of the Conservatives.

607
01:18:36,311 --> 01:18:40,748
My hectic life leaves me no leisure
to appreciate your work.

608
01:18:41,316 --> 01:18:45,013
When order is restored,
I'll commission a piece.

609
01:18:48,156 --> 01:18:49,680
Let's go.

610
01:18:58,633 --> 01:19:03,332
You gave away a screen which took you
three months to paint on rare silk and

611
01:19:03,505 --> 01:19:07,999
you didn't even get to touch her hand?
What a waste of effort!

612
01:19:10,579 --> 01:19:14,037
Now the screen's been sold
to a millionaire.

613
01:19:14,149 --> 01:19:16,617
No one else will ever even see it.

614
01:19:33,902 --> 01:19:37,099
A maranta stalk for a brush
and kimchi for paint.

615
01:19:38,473 --> 01:19:41,203
How eccentric!

616
01:19:41,343 --> 01:19:43,811
What rule says
a brush must be sable?

617
01:19:43,945 --> 01:19:46,812
I've been unable to paint,
so I did it for fun.

618
01:19:46,915 --> 01:19:52,478
You're at the peak of your powers.
Why keep striving to do even better?

619
01:19:52,687 --> 01:19:54,848
I'm keeping this painting.

620
01:19:54,990 --> 01:19:56,890
You're keeping what?

621
01:19:57,025 --> 01:19:58,788
Give it back!

622
01:20:20,482 --> 01:20:24,714
Master! Master!
Rescue him! I can't swim!

623
01:20:25,587 --> 01:20:28,055
Master!

624
01:20:30,992 --> 01:20:33,483
Did you really want to die?

625
01:20:34,930 --> 01:20:38,093
They said you refused
to let go of the rock.

626
01:20:40,902 --> 01:20:44,338
Seoul, 1882

627
01:20:54,649 --> 01:20:58,415
You won't take long to recover.
I fear for our scheme's future.

628
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:02,053
I'll soon be well.
Have no fear for me.

629
01:21:13,668 --> 01:21:15,465
So we meet again.

630
01:21:15,837 --> 01:21:20,831
Lately, you've become
a fashionable topic of discussion.

631
01:21:21,376 --> 01:21:24,311
Your paintings have become
the people's only comfort.

632
01:21:24,946 --> 01:21:30,680
It's even said that the gauge of nobility
is to own one of your paintings.

633
01:21:32,387 --> 01:21:33,820
Congratulations.

634
01:21:39,227 --> 01:21:43,960
I didn't know of your illness
and change of abode. Forgive me.

635
01:21:45,166 --> 01:21:46,758
Come indoors.

636
01:21:48,370 --> 01:21:49,997
Welcome.

637
01:21:50,772 --> 01:21:52,433
Some medicinal herbs.

638
01:21:54,843 --> 01:22:01,339
They say there is nothing
that you cannot paint.

639
01:22:02,317 --> 01:22:05,115
Portraits, still lifes,
landscapes, anything.

640
01:22:07,455 --> 01:22:12,222
Blinded by popularity,
haven't you lost your vital energy?

641
01:22:17,132 --> 01:22:20,863
An old sage once said
"With each day, deeper renewal."

642
01:22:21,336 --> 01:22:24,066
I want to make progress every day.

643
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:28,869
I won't be entangled
in my own nets.

644
01:22:28,977 --> 01:22:30,911
It's good that you're aware of it.

645
01:22:33,949 --> 01:22:37,385
In our era,
painting espouses realism...

646
01:22:38,453 --> 01:22:42,787
whereas your landscapes
portray a fantasy world,

647
01:22:44,092 --> 01:22:46,686
an exaggerated version
of plain reality.

648
01:22:47,996 --> 01:22:50,556
Rudimentary echoes
of true feelings.

649
01:22:53,568 --> 01:23:00,064
Cannot you paint life on this earth
in all its pain and harshness?

650
01:23:01,676 --> 01:23:05,009
The people have nothing
to console them.

651
01:23:05,847 --> 01:23:09,806
If I can bring them comfort
by painting fantasies,

652
01:23:10,418 --> 01:23:13,717
I will have been faithful
to my calling.

653
01:23:16,091 --> 01:23:18,321
A painting is just a painting.

654
01:23:19,027 --> 01:23:23,327
It doesn't feature
in your Party's manifesto.

655
01:23:32,941 --> 01:23:35,739
Don't go out in this downpour!

656
01:23:35,844 --> 01:23:38,711
- Wait till it stops.
- Listen to him.

657
01:24:36,037 --> 01:24:37,698
Some pine nut porridge.

658
01:24:41,176 --> 01:24:45,272
Looking at that painting
makes me feel relaxed.

659
01:24:46,014 --> 01:24:47,879
Is it that I'm getting old?

660
01:24:50,618 --> 01:24:52,984
When you have time,
come and color it.

661
01:24:56,157 --> 01:24:59,593
Why not paint the roof yellow?

662
01:25:01,162 --> 01:25:02,993
Is anybody in?

663
01:25:04,199 --> 01:25:06,258
I've come for Master Ohwon.

664
01:25:07,469 --> 01:25:11,166
A royal messenger is here. You are
summoned to the Royal Painting Office.

665
01:25:19,848 --> 01:25:21,338
The Office.

666
01:25:42,036 --> 01:25:46,370
The sixth rank entitles you
to an audience with the King.

667
01:25:46,441 --> 01:25:48,602
It's a temporary rank for you,

668
01:25:48,743 --> 01:25:52,839
but no painter from outside
the Office has held it before.

669
01:26:14,035 --> 01:26:17,368
How much longer
will you be idle?

670
01:26:27,148 --> 01:26:29,139
This is rice juice.

671
01:26:30,051 --> 01:26:34,317
Without a drink and a woman,
I can't hold a brush.

672
01:26:34,556 --> 01:26:40,722
Come, now. Don't forget that the King
forbids more than three cups a day.

673
01:26:56,811 --> 01:26:58,676
Listen, Ohwon!

674
01:26:59,881 --> 01:27:04,250
I'll rake those leaves.
You, please go indoors and paint!

675
01:27:06,721 --> 01:27:11,249
Come on, Ohwon! General Yuan
Shi-kai's birthday is coming up.

676
01:27:11,359 --> 01:27:13,850
What are you waiting for
to get started?

677
01:27:14,696 --> 01:27:16,527
Who's General Yuan Shi-kai?

678
01:27:16,764 --> 01:27:19,892
Don't you know
the mighty Chinese general?

679
01:27:20,001 --> 01:27:23,266
He can hit a bird in flight
with a single arrow.

680
01:27:24,339 --> 01:27:29,038
He is second-in-command
to the General-in-Chief!

681
01:27:33,248 --> 01:27:36,308
I should paint for
a foreigner who invades us?

682
01:27:37,018 --> 01:27:38,508
Where are you going?

683
01:27:38,620 --> 01:27:41,214
I've run out of paint.
I won't be long.

684
01:27:41,322 --> 01:27:45,315
You're not allowed out. We have
paints in the Palace. Use them.

685
01:27:46,094 --> 01:27:51,623
You arrogant rogue!
There's a shop where I buy my paints.

686
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:56,000
If I deliver late,
will you take responsibility?

687
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:04,836
Let go of me!

688
01:28:07,715 --> 01:28:11,344
Who's this I see? It's you!

689
01:28:12,487 --> 01:28:18,016
I hear you've become a great painter
for the King! What brings you here?

690
01:28:18,159 --> 01:28:21,686
I never thought
you'd rise so high!

691
01:28:21,829 --> 01:28:24,957
- It's been twenty years.
- That's right.

692
01:28:25,733 --> 01:28:28,065
You don't look a day older.

693
01:28:28,169 --> 01:28:36,099
Don't you recognize her? She's our little
girl. You used to adore her. Cho-ryang.

694
01:28:38,746 --> 01:28:45,379
Soon after her wedding, fate decreed
that her husband must die.

695
01:28:45,486 --> 01:28:48,717
She came back home
and helps us run the inn.

696
01:28:50,525 --> 01:28:52,356
Hey, Seung-ub!

697
01:28:54,028 --> 01:28:58,863
I'm so glad to see you. Do you
remember me? I'm Oh Cheon-suk.

698
01:28:58,933 --> 01:29:00,867
How could I ever forget?

699
01:29:01,235 --> 01:29:05,103
Erotic picture books
sell well these days.

700
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:09,106
They'll fetch high prices
if you paint some.

701
01:29:09,210 --> 01:29:11,178
Have a look.

702
01:29:15,116 --> 01:29:17,812
They're saucy!

703
01:29:21,389 --> 01:29:24,415
We've been combing Seoul
for you for a month.

704
01:29:24,759 --> 01:29:27,319
Where have you been hiding?

705
01:29:28,529 --> 01:29:30,394
Come with us. King's orders.

706
01:29:33,835 --> 01:29:36,167
Let go of me, halfwits!

707
01:29:54,722 --> 01:29:57,589
Excuse me!
Come here.

708
01:29:58,559 --> 01:30:00,151
What's going on outside?

709
01:30:00,228 --> 01:30:03,629
The King is moving his residence
to Kyungwoo palace.

710
01:30:03,698 --> 01:30:04,790
Why?

711
01:30:04,866 --> 01:30:07,096
With the aid of the Japanese army,

712
01:30:07,201 --> 01:30:10,728
the Reformists have seized power
and executed the top Conservatives.

713
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:14,507
The world has gone awry.

714
01:30:16,411 --> 01:30:20,211
Care to see what I'm working on?

715
01:30:20,615 --> 01:30:21,877
Yes, sir.

716
01:30:29,290 --> 01:30:31,315
Come on in.

717
01:30:31,459 --> 01:30:32,551
Yes, sir

718
01:30:56,584 --> 01:31:01,783
Let go of me, halfwits!
I'll go myself. Hands off of me.

719
01:31:02,857 --> 01:31:04,654
Let go of me, halfwits!

720
01:31:05,660 --> 01:31:06,786
1884. The Reformist Revolution.

721
01:31:06,828 --> 01:31:08,625
The Reform Party attempts a coup
with the aid of Japan.

722
01:31:08,663 --> 01:31:10,790
The coup is foiled
by the Chinese army's intervention.

723
01:31:28,249 --> 01:31:32,185
It's five days since
they came for you.

724
01:31:32,987 --> 01:31:34,887
Everyone's been worried about you.

725
01:31:36,491 --> 01:31:38,186
The world has changed a lot.

726
01:31:38,793 --> 01:31:42,957
The Reformist Revolution has been
put down by Chinese intervention.

727
01:31:44,732 --> 01:31:46,393
Hong and Park have been killed.

728
01:31:46,968 --> 01:31:51,234
The other leaders seem
to be preparing for exile in Japan.

729
01:31:55,676 --> 01:31:57,405
What became of
Master Kim Byeong-moon?

730
01:31:58,145 --> 01:32:03,082
Apparently he's hiding in some remote
place. If they catch him, he'll be executed.

731
01:32:23,237 --> 01:32:26,673
No Entry. House of Kim Byeong-moon,
guilty of high treason.

732
01:33:36,177 --> 01:33:39,704
It's a precious piece,
full of life and rhythm.

733
01:33:39,914 --> 01:33:41,347
What do you think of it, father?

734
01:33:42,049 --> 01:33:45,576
I can almost hear the wind
blowing through the trees.

735
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:49,011
- Ohwon!
- Yes, sir!

736
01:33:49,757 --> 01:33:51,918
I have seven sons.

737
01:33:52,259 --> 01:33:55,990
Paint me seven cranes
around that pine tree.

738
01:33:57,632 --> 01:34:00,123
Imagine the pine tree surrounded...

739
01:34:00,468 --> 01:34:03,960
by hills and rivers and
seven cranes already there.

740
01:34:16,183 --> 01:34:19,277
I was given this painting
when I was an official.

741
01:34:19,587 --> 01:34:23,785
Some say it's a forgery.
Since you're here, enlighten me.

742
01:34:26,427 --> 01:34:30,591
Most paintings attributed to
me are fakes. This one, too.

743
01:34:36,370 --> 01:34:40,773
When I see your work, I can tell whether
you painted it with gusto or not,

744
01:34:41,108 --> 01:34:47,206
and if you were standing or sitting.
I can even imagine your movements.

745
01:34:48,716 --> 01:34:55,144
That painting we saw was one of yours.
Why did you say it's fake?

746
01:34:55,956 --> 01:34:59,084
I gave it to a friend
for his father's birthday

747
01:34:59,160 --> 01:35:02,391
but he used it as a bribe.
That makes it a fake.

748
01:35:03,531 --> 01:35:06,261
Let me see...
I was told it's hereabouts.

749
01:35:09,870 --> 01:35:12,304
This is the kisaeng
who lived with her.

750
01:35:14,508 --> 01:35:16,135
My name is Ae-wol.

751
01:35:16,677 --> 01:35:20,374
Mae-hyang left three years ago.

752
01:35:20,915 --> 01:35:22,644
Did she say where she went?

753
01:35:22,783 --> 01:35:24,341
I don't know.

754
01:35:24,652 --> 01:35:27,815
It was dawn
on a very cold winter day.

755
01:35:28,089 --> 01:35:31,024
Some soldiers came.
She ran away half-naked.

756
01:35:31,959 --> 01:35:36,191
Three months later, one night
in spring, she sneaked back,

757
01:35:36,430 --> 01:35:39,524
took a quilted coat
and ran away again.

758
01:35:40,601 --> 01:35:44,093
The coat, which she'd
padded lovingly

759
01:35:44,138 --> 01:35:47,596
and stitched with devotion,
she intended for you.

760
01:35:53,013 --> 01:35:56,676
All these fields don't feed
the starving people,

761
01:35:56,751 --> 01:36:01,415
only the corrupt officials.
What use are all those granaries?

762
01:36:14,401 --> 01:36:24,868
It's a dream! It's a dream!
It's all like a dream!

763
01:36:25,079 --> 01:36:34,852
You and I walk into the dream
This is the very dream

764
01:36:35,089 --> 01:36:45,431
Waking from a dream makes me
fell into another dream.

765
01:36:45,633 --> 01:36:55,770
Life was born from dreams,
live in dreams and die in dreams.

766
01:36:55,976 --> 01:37:16,785
All in vain, the waking of dream.
Why then do we dream?

767
01:37:40,621 --> 01:37:42,589
Sorry to spoil your enjoyment.

768
01:37:48,696 --> 01:37:50,220
Ohwon!

769
01:37:54,201 --> 01:37:59,696
I was able to see your painting "Reeds
and Wild Geese" at Minister Min's house.

770
01:38:01,709 --> 01:38:06,339
That flock of geese
flying freely over the reeds...

771
01:38:06,847 --> 01:38:11,079
if I could see it again,
my duties would feel lighter.

772
01:38:12,920 --> 01:38:18,859
Thank you for the compliment but I
painted those wild geese ten years ago.

773
01:38:19,026 --> 01:38:22,086
How could I paint them again?

774
01:38:22,730 --> 01:38:26,393
To an artist, repetition is death.

775
01:38:29,169 --> 01:38:32,866
Why all this foolish talk?
Stick to painting!

776
01:38:33,207 --> 01:38:37,701
If you snubbed him because he's
only the Governor of Gobu village,

777
01:38:37,945 --> 01:38:40,311
you're in for a surprise.

778
01:38:40,381 --> 01:38:42,611
He's very powerful.

779
01:38:52,159 --> 01:38:55,185
Those sparrows chased by a hawk
make me sad.

780
01:38:55,396 --> 01:39:00,333
They remind me of
the suffering people of Gobu.

781
01:39:00,467 --> 01:39:03,834
But I also feel moved when
they swoop on the hawk

782
01:39:03,938 --> 01:39:07,965
like the people when
they're good and angry.

783
01:39:11,912 --> 01:39:14,346
What kind of man
is the Governor?

784
01:39:15,916 --> 01:39:19,750
With the King's support
and his own powerful family,

785
01:39:19,853 --> 01:39:23,812
he can indulge all his appetites.
He's very corrupt.

786
01:39:28,896 --> 01:39:30,989
You cheeky girl!

787
01:39:31,632 --> 01:39:36,194
How can a kisaeng like you
speak ill of the Governor?

788
01:39:36,437 --> 01:39:40,464
Keeping company with the hero
who disobeyed the King

789
01:39:40,574 --> 01:39:45,841
and escaped from the palace
has emboldened me.

790
01:39:59,493 --> 01:40:02,792
You're a plucky woman!

791
01:40:12,306 --> 01:40:14,604
Fine furrowed field,

792
01:40:15,376 --> 01:40:18,641
will you receive my seed?

793
01:40:18,846 --> 01:40:22,577
I'm ready. I'll bear your child.

794
01:40:23,183 --> 01:40:27,142
I'll make him a painter
greater than you

795
01:40:27,287 --> 01:40:30,154
and wipe out the rancor
of my humble roots.

796
01:40:33,160 --> 01:40:38,393
Thank you.
Fate decreed that we should meet.

797
01:40:38,966 --> 01:40:41,298
Get harder.

798
01:40:42,403 --> 01:40:48,342
Gather your energy.
You must sow deep inside me.

799
01:40:52,446 --> 01:40:54,607
Harder.

800
01:40:55,382 --> 01:40:57,748
Harder...

801
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:18,699
That's good...

802
01:41:58,378 --> 01:42:02,610
Out you come.
Son of a bitch!

803
01:42:10,524 --> 01:42:12,515
Let him get dressed.

804
01:42:12,926 --> 01:42:16,123
Where is the Governor
of Gobu hiding?

805
01:42:16,263 --> 01:42:19,926
I don't know.
He hasn't been here.

806
01:42:20,033 --> 01:42:21,830
Mongrel dog!

807
01:42:21,969 --> 01:42:26,633
The lapdog doesn't know where
its mangy master is? Don't give me that.

808
01:42:26,740 --> 01:42:29,607
Beat it out of him!

809
01:42:30,611 --> 01:42:32,806
Here's another.

810
01:42:35,582 --> 01:42:40,019
Please don't kill him! He's the
famous artist, Ohwon Jang Seung-ub!

811
01:42:40,120 --> 01:42:44,181
He came from Seoul just to paint.
Spare his life.

812
01:42:44,691 --> 01:42:48,457
If it's Ohwon Jang Seung-ub,
let him go.

813
01:42:48,595 --> 01:42:52,759
We can't lose a man
of such divine talent.

814
01:43:01,875 --> 01:43:06,335
You're just a parasite, feeding on
the honey you get from noblemen.

815
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:09,847
A grubby little money-grabber.

816
01:43:09,950 --> 01:43:12,384
Piece of shit!

817
01:43:18,292 --> 01:43:20,021
Master.

818
01:43:23,897 --> 01:43:25,990
I've decided to stay here.

819
01:43:26,733 --> 01:43:32,137
Becoming a painter like you always
seemed like a wild dream to me.

820
01:43:33,774 --> 01:43:36,743
I served you because
I enjoyed your company

821
01:43:37,411 --> 01:43:40,847
but seeing those people,
I've found my true calling.

822
01:43:42,416 --> 01:43:47,353
If I can help to change the world,
I want to join up.

823
01:44:19,519 --> 01:44:21,783
Where will you go, Master?

824
01:44:23,090 --> 01:44:27,686
Life is a drifting cloud.
I'll go wherever my feet take me.

825
01:44:29,863 --> 01:44:33,959
Protecting the homeland
and Comforting the people.

826
01:44:36,403 --> 01:44:40,271
Eliminating the violence
and Salvating the people.

827
01:44:41,108 --> 01:44:43,303
1894. The Peasants' Revolt.

828
01:44:43,443 --> 01:44:45,968
The tyranny of the governor
Cho Byung-Gap caused...

829
01:44:46,113 --> 01:44:47,978
the sweeping uprise of
the smothered people of Chosun.

830
01:45:20,347 --> 01:45:28,516
Master! Master!

831
01:45:37,264 --> 01:45:39,528
What are you doing here?

832
01:45:39,633 --> 01:45:43,467
I never thought I'd see you
in this world again.

833
01:45:59,519 --> 01:46:02,955
The folk here are honest
and good-hearted.

834
01:46:03,457 --> 01:46:07,951
I live quietly,
teaching the children.

835
01:46:11,164 --> 01:46:14,793
You should come back to Seoul.

836
01:46:15,969 --> 01:46:20,497
With Japan in power, the Reformists
are gaining fresh impetus.

837
01:46:22,042 --> 01:46:23,942
I like this place.

838
01:46:25,112 --> 01:46:28,275
Reform was a useless dream.

839
01:46:30,183 --> 01:46:32,310
We should have relied on ourselves.

840
01:46:32,986 --> 01:46:37,719
If the revolution had won
with the help of Japan,

841
01:46:38,024 --> 01:46:40,720
what future would
our country have had?

842
01:46:43,930 --> 01:46:50,563
Rumor has it the rebellious peasants
were massacred at Ugeumchi.

843
01:46:54,040 --> 01:46:59,342
Protecting the homeland and the people...
Yet another empty dream.

844
01:47:00,347 --> 01:47:03,748
When downtrodden,
one must rise up for justice

845
01:47:04,384 --> 01:47:07,410
but one must pick the right moment.

846
01:47:08,622 --> 01:47:13,525
They gave foreigners an excuse
to enter our country.

847
01:47:13,994 --> 01:47:17,157
We should have built up
our own forces.

848
01:47:22,669 --> 01:47:26,901
I happened upon
this painting of yours.

849
01:47:28,742 --> 01:47:34,840
In it, I finally felt
the heartbeat of Korea.

850
01:47:36,416 --> 01:47:41,251
It's a masterpiece.
Not a single stroke is wasted.

851
01:48:31,538 --> 01:48:35,736
Who the hell are you? The rebel leader
was sold out by his trusted aide.

852
01:48:35,909 --> 01:48:39,777
Night is falling
on the Chosun dynasty.

853
01:48:41,715 --> 01:48:49,486
Your painting is the last flicker
of life in this dying country.

854
01:49:29,563 --> 01:49:35,934
Catholics being less persecuted,
I came back to Seoul not long ago.

855
01:49:36,570 --> 01:49:42,008
Since I'm only a kisaeng, I drifted
from one house of joy to another.

856
01:49:43,109 --> 01:49:48,376
The Governor of Jeju island liked me
so I came with him to Seoul.

857
01:49:48,515 --> 01:49:56,980
He died soon after.
I opened this house thanks to him.

858
01:50:01,428 --> 01:50:09,392
I have no worries about money.
Stay here and do your painting.

859
01:50:10,870 --> 01:50:15,170
As I was sure you'd
come back to me one day,

860
01:50:15,542 --> 01:50:18,272
I made this quilted coat with love.

861
01:50:24,417 --> 01:50:27,909
At last it has found its lord.

862
01:50:40,734 --> 01:50:43,294
Do you recognize this?

863
01:50:45,138 --> 01:50:49,768
You painted it for me
when we first met.

864
01:50:52,846 --> 01:50:58,182
If I asked you for another one,
would you paint it for me?

865
01:51:04,391 --> 01:51:09,590
That jar over there. Where did you
find such a plain, simple piece?

866
01:51:11,364 --> 01:51:17,860
The modest hand that made it
was guided by a joyful heart.

867
01:51:18,972 --> 01:51:25,639
It looks almost unfinished,
yet it's so generous and warm.

868
01:51:27,247 --> 01:51:29,841
Your bath is ready.

869
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:25,169
I'm a wandering painter.
Perhaps I could stay here...

870
01:52:25,972 --> 01:52:31,000
With the competition from Japanese
porcelain, it's hard to make a living.

871
01:52:31,077 --> 01:52:33,637
As long as I can eat,
I'll be happy.

872
01:52:33,813 --> 01:52:38,250
Pots don't sell any better
with pretty pictures on them.

873
01:53:22,762 --> 01:53:26,960
I messed it.
Clean it off for me.

874
01:53:28,301 --> 01:53:31,566
How the hell can he paint
with a shaking hand?

875
01:53:31,671 --> 01:53:33,832
Don't be rude!

876
01:54:02,836 --> 01:54:07,273
May the gods grant us
fair weather and fair winds.

877
01:54:43,743 --> 01:54:48,237
Please forgive my ignorance.

878
01:54:48,915 --> 01:54:52,749
You're no ordinary painter.

879
01:55:00,226 --> 01:55:05,687
Speaking for yourself,
what kind of jar do you wish for?

880
01:55:06,699 --> 01:55:10,499
Painters like you want
the iron powder to stick...

881
01:55:10,670 --> 01:55:13,935
so that the piece will have life.

882
01:55:14,140 --> 01:55:19,168
The glazers want their glaze
to spread properly.

883
01:55:19,545 --> 01:55:24,073
The owner of the kiln
hopes for a masterpiece or two.

884
01:55:24,183 --> 01:55:31,146
But the decision is not ours.
Fire dictates all.

885
01:55:47,774 --> 01:55:51,767
Are you staying up?
I'm going to turn in.

886
01:57:06,152 --> 01:57:07,949
Ohwon vanished without trace in 1897.

887
01:57:07,987 --> 01:57:09,352
According to legend,
he went up Diamond Mountain

888
01:57:09,389 --> 01:57:11,448
and became an immortal hermit.
