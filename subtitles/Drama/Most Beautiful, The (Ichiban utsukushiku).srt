I can't even find a topic for my doctorate.

Well, on the bright side,

This is a group playing touch football.

ALICIA: What's wrong with him?

863
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:42,952
John has schizophrenia.

864
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:46,954
People with this disorder
are often paranoid.

Yes, I know.

ROSEN: In John's world,
these behaviors are accepted...

...encouraged.

870

As such,

01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:12,832
Possibly since graduate school.

At least that's when his hallucinations
seem to have begun.

What are you talking about?
What hallucinations?

876
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:20,556
One, so far, that I am aware of.

877
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:24,118
An imaginary roommate
named Charles Herman.

878
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:27,316
Charles isn't imaginary.

879
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:29,516
They have been best friends
since Princeton.

880
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:32,558
Have you ever met Charles?
Has he ever come to dinner?

881
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:35,879
He's always in town
for so little time, lecturing.

-Was he at your wedding?
-He had to teach.

Have you seen a picture,
or talked to him on the phone?

According to their housing records,
John lived alone.

Now, which is more likely?
That your husband...

...a mathematician
with no military training...

-You're making him sound crazy.

890
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:03,718
Or, that he has lost his grip on reality?

891
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:09,637
The only way I can help him,
is to show him the difference...

892
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:13,077
...between what is real
and what is in his mind.

01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:22,232
What's he been working on?

895
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:25,439
His work is classified.

896
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:27,596
He mentioned a supervisor...

897
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,877
...by the name of William Parcher.

898
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:32,595
Maybe Mr. Parcher
can clarify things for us.

899

But I can't get to him without clearances.

of my husband's work?

...let us say, 10 miles per hour.

1391
01:53:04,400 --> 01:53:06,994
So you have a fly
on the tire of bicycle "B"...

...and the fly,
who can travel at 20 miles an hour...

...leaves the tire of "B"
and flies to the tire of bicycle "A"...

...and backwards and forwards
until the two bikes collide...

...and the poor little fly is squashed.

but I'm just a little stunned.

1444
01:56:05,160 --> 01:56:08,436
KING: Over the past years, your
equilibrium has become a cornerstone...

1445
01:56:08,520 --> 01:56:10,112
...of modern economics.

1446
01:56:10,200 --> 01:56:12,270
Suddenly everybody likes that one.

1447
01:56:12,360 --> 01:56:16,433
What about my work on other some
such projects like manifold embedding?

1448
01:56:16,760 --> 01:56:19,957
The application
of your bargaining problem...

1449
01:56:20,200 --> 01:56:23,954
...to FCC bandwidth auctions
or to antitrust cases--

1450
01:56:24,040 --> 01:56:25,439
-Antitrust cases?
-Yes.

1451
01:56:25,520 --> 01:56:27,670
I never would have considered that.

1452
01:56:28,160 --> 01:56:32,438
Have I just reached some level of honesty
that borders on stupidity?

1453
01:56:32,720 --> 01:56:36,156
KING: [Laughs] No, you haven't.
JOHN: I wouldn't have thought of that.

1454
01:56:41,320 --> 01:56:42,753
Shall we have tea?

1455
01:56:44,800 --> 01:56:48,713
I don't go in there.
I usually take my sandwich in the library.

1456
01:56:49,840 --> 01:56:52,752
Come on, John. Let's have some tea.
It's a big day.

1457
01:56:53,440 --> 01:56:58,673
Most commercially available brands of tea
are not suitable to my palate.

1458
01:56:58,760 --> 01:56:59,875
I'm not....

1459
01:57:00,240 --> 01:57:03,596
There are some Northern Indian teas
which are dense enough....

1460
01:57:03,680 --> 01:57:07,389
I enjoy the flavor that they have.
I have not been in this room...

1461
01:57:07,480 --> 01:57:10,438
...for quite some many years.
I wonder what tea they serve.

1462
01:57:12,440 --> 01:57:14,158
JOHN: Why, thank you, young lady.

1463
01:57:15,960 --> 01:57:19,669
Things have certainly changed around here.
I have a son that age.

1464
01:57:21,400 --> 01:57:22,435
Harvard.

1465
01:57:27,320 --> 01:57:28,116
JOHN: Hmm.

1466
01:57:28,200 --> 01:57:33,194
I would have thought the nominations
for the Nobel Prize would've been secret.

1467
01:57:33,680 --> 01:57:36,990
I would have thought you'd only find out
if you won or lost.

1468
01:57:37,240 --> 01:57:40,994
That is generally the case, yes,
but these are special circumstances.

1469
01:57:42,560 --> 01:57:44,278
The awards are substantial.

1470
01:57:44,880 --> 01:57:47,838
They require private funding as such...

1471
01:57:49,200 --> 01:57:51,236
...the image of the Nobel is....

1472
01:57:53,400 --> 01:57:56,119
I see, you came here
to find out if I was crazy?

1473
01:57:57,440 --> 01:58:00,955
Find out if I would screw everything up
if I actually won?

1474
01:58:02,880 --> 01:58:06,873
Dance around the podium,
strip naked and squawk like a chicken?

1475
01:58:07,480 --> 01:58:09,152
Something like that, yes.

1476
01:58:10,720 --> 01:58:12,312
Would I embarrass you?

1477
01:58:16,240 --> 01:58:17,753
Yes, it is possible.

1478
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:22,149
You see, I....

1479
01:58:23,920 --> 01:58:25,353
I am crazy.

1480
01:58:27,560 --> 01:58:29,596
I take the newer medications...

1481
01:58:33,120 --> 01:58:35,634
...but I still see things that are not here.

1482
01:58:38,120 --> 01:58:40,395
I just choose not to acknowledge them.

1483
01:58:42,280 --> 01:58:46,159
Like a diet of the mind,
I choose not to indulge certain appetites.

1484
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:51,075
Like my appetite for patterns.

1485
01:58:52,960 --> 01:58:56,111
Perhaps my appetite to imagine
and to dream.

1486

MAN: Professor Nash.

1487
01:59:03,920 --> 01:59:06,309
It's good to have you here, John.

1488
01:59:07,080 --> 01:59:08,115
Thank you.

1489
01:59:12,640 --> 01:59:15,950
-lt's an honor, sir.
-Thank you very much.

1490
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:18,638
A privilege, Professor.

1491
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:24,074
Professor.

-Nicely done, John.
-Thank you, Tom.

1494
01:59:33,520 --> 01:59:34,555
Thank you.

Thank you, Ed.

1497
01:59:55,160 --> 01:59:57,230
That was certainly most unexpected.

December 1994

1501

JOHN: Thank you.

1502
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:25,991
I've always believed in numbers.

1503
02:00:27,160 --> 02:00:30,197
In the equations and logics
that lead to reason.

1504
02:00:31,320 --> 02:00:33,709
But after a lifetime of such pursuits...

1505
02:00:34,520 --> 02:00:37,751
...I ask, what truly is logic?

1506
02:00:39,440 --> 02:00:41,078
Who decides reason?

1507
02:00:42,840 --> 02:00:45,798
My quest has taken me
through the physical...

1508
02:00:46,680 --> 02:00:48,238
...the metaphysical...

1509
02:00:49,440 --> 02:00:50,919
...the delusional...

1510
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:54,149
...and back.

1511
02:00:55,960 --> 02:00:59,157
And I have made the most important
discovery of my career.

1512
02:01:01,320 --> 02:01:03,709
The most important discovery of my life.

1513
02:01:06,880 --> 02:01:09,792
It is only in the mysterious equations
of love...

1514
02:01:10,560 --> 02:01:13,074
...that any logical reasons can be found.

1515
02:01:16,480 --> 02:01:18,914
I'm only here tonight because of you.

1516
02:01:20,800 --> 02:01:22,631
You are the reason I am.

1517
02:01:27,440 --> 02:01:29,237
You are all my reasons.

1518

Thank you.

JOHN: So nice to have met you.

1520
02:02:31,760 --> 02:02:33,318
I'll call for the car, Dad.

-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

-Are you ready to go now?
-Yes, I am.

1523
02:02:39,560 --> 02:02:41,551
Yes, indeed, and yes, please.

1524
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:43,558
Thank you so much.

1525
02:02:44,880 --> 02:02:45,995
Thank you.

1526
02:02:48,600 --> 02:02:50,477
What is it? What's wrong?

1527
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:56,115
Nothing.

Nothing at all.
