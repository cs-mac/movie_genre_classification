1
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:38,181
Hey... come on!

2
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:09,953
Beauty...

3
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:13,359
are you hungry?

4
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:18,994
What would you like to eat?

5
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:27,333
Congratulations, boss...

6
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,511
Say it and I'll get you
whatever you want!

7
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:42,452
Really?

8
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:46,250
Really. My heart is now yours.

9
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,322
Hey, caught it.

10
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:39,874
It's on fire...

11
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,047
Sneak attack! Chase them...

12
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:48,448
Shoot!

13
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:30,825
It is bad, boss!

14
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,918
Come on! I'll take you away!

15
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:04,694
Come on!

16
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:10,364
Hold me tight!

17
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,772
Sacrifice our lives!

18
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,845
For the sake of our parents!

19
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:28,918
Spill our blood!

20
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:32,057
For the sake of our home!

21
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:34,623
Walk a million miles!

22
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:37,853
And kill the bandits of the desert!

23
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:41,192
To save the beauty!

24
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:58,383
They're back! They're back!
General is back!

25
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:27,271
We saved her halfway.

26
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:29,136
Her parents are dead.

27
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,788
Why disappeared?

28
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:17,361
Someone's knocking the door?

29
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:30,908
Open the door.

30
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:54,026
Mistress!

31
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:55,063
Mistress!

32
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:56,491
Mistress!

33
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:57,862
Can't we just send him to an inn?

34
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:58,798
Bullshit!

35
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:03,873
We're brothers.

36
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:06,739
And it's New Year.

37
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:10,444
Who?

38
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:13,148
He's back.

39
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:21,457
You're all here.

40
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:22,423
Miss Xiaowei.

41
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:24,062
It's so cold outside.

42
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:24,922
- Drink some hot water.
- Give it to me!

43
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:26,393
Have some osmanthus flower cakes!

44
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:27,661
Okay, thank you.

45
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:28,797
Thanks, Miss Xiaowei.

46
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:31,898
Brother Gao Xiang, drink while it's hot.

47
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:32,934
So attentive.

48
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:39,907
Who is this man?

49
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:44,044
He...

50
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,299
Right there!

51
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:30,285
General...

52
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:31,353
General...

53
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:32,524
General, are you okay?

54
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:34,022
Why didn't you wait for us?

55
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:35,625
General...

56
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:36,795
Have you gone mad?

57
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,187
Hundreds of gangsters here!

58
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,824
You said

59
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:44,599
we're all brothers who'd die together.

60
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:47,067
We must go home all alive!

61
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:02,710
I'll never lead you.

62
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:06,982
Brother Yong.

63
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:09,093
- General...
- Brother Yong.

64
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:10,258
Freeze!

65
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:11,395
You won't!

66
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:13,128
A soldier like you can't go as you wish!

67
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:15,630
This is desertion...

68
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:17,392
and the penalty is death!

69
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:18,228
No!

70
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:19,335
No...

71
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:20,470
Get away!

72
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:21,535
Leave me!

73
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:29,445
Everybody, take care.

74
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:37,913
- General...
- Brother Yong.

75
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:53,232
Have you contacted him?

76
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,807
No.

77
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:57,973
Don't you want him to come back?

78
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:00,036
Of course I do!

79
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,444
Perhaps he can catch the guy...

80
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:04,912
who tore the man's heart out.

81
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:12,285
I just never thought...

82
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:15,753
he'd been dejected like this.

83
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:21,156
We're married already.
How about letting him stay?

84
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:27,561
Do you know?

85
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:30,499
I've been worried about you every day.

86
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:18,613
Be careful.

87
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:40,596
Not woken up yet?

88
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:45,776
No.

89
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:54,083
Let me get you some tea.

90
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:04,656
Peirong. I haven't slept
a wink for days.

91
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:13,069
Peirong... I've drunk too much!

92
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:14,570
Brother Yong.

93
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,173
You've woken up.

94
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,354
Sorry.

95
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:37,993
Thanks.

96
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:39,726
I'm going!

97
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:42,362
Brother Yong.

98
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:52,341
Hey brother,

99
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:55,004
It's New Year's Eve. At least stay...

100
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:56,306
with us for the...

101
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:57,504
No, thanks!

102
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:00,778
Brother Yong, just wait a moment.

103
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:02,886
I've got something to return to you.

104
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,636
Brother Yong, your sword.

105
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:31,616
Wish you good luck.

106
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:50,524
Waiter, any spare room?

107
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:52,292
Yes, sure...

108
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:56,599
Please pay a deposit
at the counter first, sir.

109
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:58,031
I'm leaving my horse here,

110
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,369
and you think I'll run away?

111
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,547
Okay, fine...

112
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:08,210
Waiter, don't forget to look
after my horse!

113
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,116
I will, I guarantee. Rest assured!

114
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,538
Please pay a deposit first, sir.

115
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:29,631
I'm leaving my horse here...

116
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:30,968
and you think I'll run away?

117
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:32,834
Take care of my horse!

118
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:35,777
I will!

119
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:41,649
Take care, sir. Happy new year!

120
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:42,684
Let's go.

121
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:43,855
Waiter, it's a big inn;

122
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:45,318
nothing more than that.

123
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:46,456
Not even a slice of meat?

124
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:48,023
They've all gone home for new year,

125
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:49,489
so has the chef.

126
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:51,128
Let it be...any wine?

127
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,298
Sure...I'll take it now!

128
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:55,761
A bottle of best spring liquor!

129
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:59,362
Sir, it's just sold out!

130
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:02,297
She's taken all the rest.

131
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:04,833
Sir, please choose others.

132
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:11,874
Come here. Be my guest!

133
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:13,480
Please!

134
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:24,092
Waiter.

135
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:25,861
Waiter, one more bottle!

136
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:29,427
Waiter...

137
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,132
No need. Here.

138
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:52,821
I'll give this pair of jade pendants
to who you love!

139
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:12,106
How're you doing?

140
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:15,774
Where have you been the last two years?

141
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:17,374
You're here just to ask...

142
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:18,777
such dull questions?

143
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:26,791
I suspect if there's a demon
in our house.

144
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:29,953
Three months ago,

145
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:34,289
When Brother Sheng was back after
encountering bandits in the desert,

146
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:37,502
he rescued a young woman
with nowhere to stay.

147
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:39,165
Elder sister.

148
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,303
Her names is Xiaowei.

149
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:44,305
She claimed to be daughter of Gao Kun,

150
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,841
a wealthy silk businessman.

151
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:50,437
Her parents were framed
and killed by corrupt officials

152
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,708
and she was sold to the bandits...

153
00:20:58,157 --> 00:20:58,953
Tell me.

154
00:20:59,158 --> 00:21:01,854
So many people love Xiaowei.
Who will she go for?

155
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:04,556
How do I guess what's
in a woman's heart?

156
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:07,627
Suddenly,

157
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,293
there appeared an assassin
in the city...

158
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:12,464
who tore out the hearts of so many.

159
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:14,569
The new magistrate has not yet come.

160
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,764
But there can't be without law
in the city.

161
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:19,838
Brothers,
we will now take charge of the city

162
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:21,672
till the new magistrate takes up his post.

163
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:22,871
Are you ready?

164
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:24,605
- The assassin keeps killing.
- Ready!

165
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:28,047
- Nobody can deal with it.
- Go!

166
00:21:28,554 --> 00:21:31,648
The only thing he can do is step up
the patrols every night.

167
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:34,458
Then some times later, people start to

168
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:38,294
doubt if they're all the work
of evil demons.

169
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:41,792
These are the pearl powder...

170
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,864
New arrival.

171
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:44,035
Do you want to try it?

172
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:50,666
Miss, what you want is this, right?

173
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:51,968
Why should I buy this?

174
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:54,742
You have to!

175
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:02,854
I'll take them all.

176
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:07,781
You gotta put on makeup!

177
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:14,358
Sure! I gotta put on makeup!

178
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:15,396
This way, please.

179
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:21,698
Is she really an evil demon?

180
00:22:22,975 --> 00:22:23,907
I can't help you.

181
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,334
Let me find you a man of power!

182
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:29,035
Stay back. Back off...

183
00:22:29,248 --> 00:22:31,216
The Taoist priest is dead,
with his heart torn out...

184
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:33,815
The killer is a big, tall guy.

185
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:39,924
Xiaorou, hand me the medical kit!

186
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:41,057
Xiaowei is hurt!

187
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,192
Sister.

188
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:47,388
You didn't hurt me. See, I'm fine!

189
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:51,667
Impossible! I clearly saw her wound!

190
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:53,169
What're you talking about?

191
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:56,999
She's not an evil demon, is she?

192
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:05,411
She's surely fun, and charming.

193
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,810
But how could she possibly be?

194
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:15,358
Only you can tempt me.

195
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:18,323
I've sent you so many letters.

196
00:23:19,031 --> 00:23:20,623
Don't know if you got them.

197
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:22,697
What's up now?

198
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:24,667
Now, she's become...

199
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:28,666
more friendly with everyone,

200
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,608
and she's getting very close
to Brother Sheng.

201
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:34,278
Anyone knows you suspect she's a demon?

202
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,580
How dare I tell anyone else?

203
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,383
No one would believe me.

204
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:46,422
Demon?

205
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:51,926
You don't believe me, either?

206
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,290
I do, of course!

207
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:55,891
When did I ever disbelieve you?

208
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:04,669
What do you want me to do?

209
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:06,536
Find out the truth!

210
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:08,808
What if she's really not a demon?

211
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:11,174
Then I'll admit I'm wrong.

212
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:16,111
Please, Brother Yong!

213
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:19,221
Any money?

214
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:27,825
Find me if you don't have enough.

215
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:37,000
Lend me some money.

216
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:40,137
No money? But you invited me
for a drink!

217
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:42,573
You enjoyed it too, didn't you?

218
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:09,204
I've sliced them for you
from six humans.

219
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:13,238
Why killed so many?
How to eat them all at once?

220
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:16,672
For you to choose. It's just a few.

221
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:20,380
I don't mean to feel bad for them.

222
00:25:20,585 --> 00:25:23,315
But you've made a lot of work
for Wang Sheng.

223
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:25,556
I hardly see him these days.

224
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,124
You're so disgusting.

225
00:25:39,805 --> 00:25:40,999
You're wasting your time.

226
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:44,533
He will love me.

227
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,173
Why don't you just be his concubine?

228
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,514
What I want to be is his wife.

229
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:55,379
Listen. I shall be Mrs. Wang.

230
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:57,883
So you want to give up your training?

231
00:25:58,457 --> 00:25:59,981
I have plenty of time.

232
00:26:00,192 --> 00:26:01,625
But your skin won't wait.

233
00:26:02,194 --> 00:26:04,094
You need more hearts...

234
00:26:04,463 --> 00:26:05,987
to keep your human skin from rotting.

235
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:12,234
Sure! Therefore, I've got
to find a way out

236
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:16,630
so I can stop myself eating such gross!

237
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:28,243
Hurry up!

238
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:30,215
Be careful.

239
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,723
Didn't I say you should wait for me?

240
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:33,514
Miss Xiaowei said...

241
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:34,749
Master's irritated...

242
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,587
so we hurried to give the dishes.

243
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:40,455
Let me do it.

244
00:26:45,737 --> 00:26:46,726
Sister-in-law.

245
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:49,333
Sister-in-law.

246
00:26:49,574 --> 00:26:50,836
Mistress.

247
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,444
Start the meal.

248
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:01,944
Start the meal.

249
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:10,992
Let me do it.

250
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,302
Where have you just been?

251
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,676
Everybody's waiting for you.

252
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:29,713
I've just...

253
00:27:29,915 --> 00:27:32,383
Brother Wang, don't be upset with her.

254
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:36,143
Sister Peirong went to the beauty shop

255
00:27:36,354 --> 00:27:37,946
for some lavender

256
00:27:38,356 --> 00:27:41,189
to put under your pillow in a bag,

257
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:43,253
so you can sleep well.

258
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:47,523
It's New Year now.

259
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:51,429
Don't worry too much.

260
00:27:53,738 --> 00:27:54,534
I know.

261
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,678
Sister.

262
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:05,144
Are you looking for this?

263
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,217
I must thank you today.

264
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:20,254
I'll give it to Brother Sheng.

265
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:26,598
I know who you've been to see.

266
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:38,579
I won't tell Brother Wang.

267
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:46,979
Something is actually
not what you think.

268
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:50,519
Anyway,

269
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:55,330
I'll tell you more about us later.

270
00:28:56,434 --> 00:28:58,493
It's good as long as you're happy.

271
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:01,666
Have a rest.

272
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:38,065
The dead bodies whose hearts...

273
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:39,504
are removed are all here.

274
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:43,110
Brother Sheng has run out of ideas,
so our Wang's Squadron...

275
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:44,804
can only patrol every night.

276
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:45,948
Wang's Squadron?

277
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:49,012
You've left for so long.

278
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:50,687
Should we still call it
"Pang's Squadron"?

279
00:29:57,429 --> 00:29:58,521
Wow!

280
00:29:59,731 --> 00:30:00,891
This man is a real pro!

281
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,431
So accurate that...

282
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:05,693
he dug out the heart in a single cut!

283
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:09,296
So I told Brother Sheng
this couldn't be done by a human.

284
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:11,434
You really believe in demons?

285
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,611
If I were a yin yang master,
I surely did...

286
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,712
A demon! A demon here!

287
00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:19,440
Look at yourself. You believe
in any crap!

288
00:30:19,684 --> 00:30:21,276
What do you not believe?
Yin yang master!

289
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:24,818
Also, I suspect one person.

290
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,520
The woman Brother Sheng brought here -
Xiaowei.

291
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:30,386
Don't you love her?

292
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:31,653
Not for sure!

293
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:32,830
You suspect her?

294
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:35,393
The killing spree began
once she arrived.

295
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,032
I really feel the evil "qi" from her!

296
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:37,859
- With suspicious background...
- Alright...

297
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:40,162
Enough! You can set up a booth out there
and fool the guys!

298
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:42,862
Get off! You feel good
staying in a coffin?

299
00:30:43,308 --> 00:30:44,366
Get off!

300
00:30:48,246 --> 00:30:49,406
What he say is correct!

301
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:51,916
All done by evil demons!

302
00:30:52,383 --> 00:30:53,543
I too think evil demons did these.

303
00:30:53,752 --> 00:30:56,186
Don't listen to her foolish talk!
It's all nonsense!

304
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:58,889
What foolish talk? I've seen before!

305
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:00,557
There're many demons in this world.

306
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:03,620
Some are transformed from flowers,
grasses and trees...

307
00:31:03,828 --> 00:31:05,796
some from tigers, wolves,
snakes, foxes...

308
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:08,294
and some from love and hatred...

309
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,831
- Some are good, some are bad...
- Don't kid me!

310
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,399
Demons kill with a sword?

311
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:15,165
Why do humans kill humans
for their hearts?

312
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:19,970
What's your name? You seem very sure.

313
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,141
My name is Xia Bing.

314
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,275
I'm a "Demon Buster".

315
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:26,210
My name is Pang Yong.

316
00:31:26,518 --> 00:31:27,815
I don't believe in demons.

317
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:33,022
This sealed part of fox tail...

318
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,317
will direct us to the
"Beautiful Fox from the Sky".

319
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:37,822
Once it senses a fox
spirit in the vicinity,

320
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:39,686
it glares.

321
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:42,496
This is what brought me here.

322
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:45,429
I'm sure the demon
is still in this city.

323
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:47,761
Can you sense where the demon is?

324
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:51,132
Within a ten-mile radius of here.

325
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,205
The entire city
is only some ten miles long.

326
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:04,282
I've made a box for you.

327
00:32:05,557 --> 00:32:08,958
Put the hearts inside
and they'll be kept fresh.

328
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:10,659
Just put it there.

329
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:15,055
Brother Sheng asked me to draw
the "heart-digger".

330
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,693
I must do it well.

331
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:25,432
Remember that old fella surnamed Xia
who chopped you?

332
00:32:26,911 --> 00:32:28,173
Isn't he dead?

333
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:32,143
His granddaughter is here in town.

334
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:39,482
Damn it! Their family never let me go.

335
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:40,918
Shall I kill her for you?

336
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:42,415
Yes.

337
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:44,554
Such a big range!

338
00:32:44,863 --> 00:32:45,989
This is the last place!

339
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:47,687
I've spent all my money on the case.

340
00:32:48,233 --> 00:32:49,791
The Taoist priest died right here!

341
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:51,726
Also,

342
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,832
all the murders occurred
on the east side of the city.

343
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:55,835
Look.

344
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:01,668
Not only that.
They all surrounded commander's house!

345
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,177
Exactly!

346
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:04,507
So what do we do next?

347
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:05,705
Nothing to do with you.

348
00:33:07,218 --> 00:33:08,742
Miss, this is the official matter.

349
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:10,352
I think you needn't ask.

350
00:33:10,889 --> 00:33:12,379
He doesn't work for the
government, either!

351
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:16,016
Nothing to do with you as well.

352
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:20,992
Hey, where're you going?

353
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:24,295
Nothing to do with you!

354
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:26,995
Hey...

355
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:29,864
I've used up my money!

356
00:34:05,743 --> 00:34:06,869
Are you okay?

357
00:34:10,648 --> 00:34:11,706
You're that demon?

358
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:13,008
Don't fool around!

359
00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:15,979
You wanna run?

360
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,724
You go over there.

361
00:34:32,303 --> 00:34:33,702
Leave me alone! Get him!

362
00:35:52,784 --> 00:35:54,911
Waiter! Waiter!

363
00:35:56,487 --> 00:36:00,548
Stop shouting. It's new year's day.
Everybody's gone.

364
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:22,002
Do you come to drink or heal me?

365
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:24,807
Don't panic. Just a small wound.

366
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:29,014
What're you doing?

367
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:33,857
Why didn't you tell me you'd blow?

368
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:36,222
I had wine in my mouth.
I couldn't tell you.

369
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:39,291
Have you seen enough?

370
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:40,896
Don't move.

371
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:44,161
What?

372
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,265
What... you...

373
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:51,202
Softly... softly...

374
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:52,772
Be quiet.

375
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:55,345
It's done by a sword!

376
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:57,942
Can a demon use a sword?

377
00:36:58,149 --> 00:36:59,582
Who say they can't?

378
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,951
Softly, softy...

379
00:37:03,855 --> 00:37:05,220
How do you deal with them?

380
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:10,286
Ordinary demons can be finished by
a single slash.

381
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:12,794
What if they're not ordinary?

382
00:37:21,506 --> 00:37:22,632
This is this "Demon Rod".

383
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:24,935
My grandpa told me that...

384
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,673
its power is beyond limit...

385
00:37:28,312 --> 00:37:29,802
when it meets a capable person.

386
00:37:30,781 --> 00:37:32,408
That person is surely not you!

387
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:35,912
I can't take it out.

388
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,643
Not me, either.

389
00:38:04,815 --> 00:38:07,045
I think your grandpa also couldn't.

390
00:38:07,251 --> 00:38:09,082
Sure! How do you know?

391
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:13,984
You don't believe my words?

392
00:38:15,927 --> 00:38:18,828
Yes, yes. I dare not disbelieve!

393
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,509
Don't get caught.

394
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:39,412
I must've killed the gal...

395
00:38:39,684 --> 00:38:41,174
if it weren't for that drunk.

396
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:46,454
So she was really
helped from her old lover.

397
00:38:54,198 --> 00:38:54,960
Where did you go?

398
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:58,363
I... I just helped in the study...

399
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:01,894
You go to the kitchen, then.

400
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:02,765
Yes!

401
00:39:03,407 --> 00:39:04,669
Brother Yong, I've checked it.

402
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:06,866
There's a rich man called Gao Kun
in another city.

403
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:09,137
The whole family died of a plague
three years ago.

404
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,440
He doesn't have a daughter.
This woman's lying.

405
00:39:14,218 --> 00:39:16,243
Peirong, where's Xiaowei?

406
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:17,478
In the beauty shop.

407
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:20,179
Brother Yong, what do you find her for?

408
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:22,019
She's not what she claims to be!

409
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,527
You've brought a demon home!

410
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:26,023
Demon?

411
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:30,230
Brother Yong,
you do believe a rumor like this?

412
00:39:31,068 --> 00:39:32,501
I just want to find out the truth.

413
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:34,732
Truth. Fine.

414
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,569
I'll get you there and see the truth.

415
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:43,069
The Gao family has no daughter!
Who are you?

416
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:46,209
Xiahou Xiang is known to be wrong
all the time!

417
00:39:46,651 --> 00:39:47,845
Has he misunderstood you?

418
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:50,213
That's right! Miss Xiaowei,
just go ahead

419
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:51,752
tell us your difficulties!

420
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:54,155
Xiaowei, don't be scared.

421
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:55,886
Tell us everything!

422
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:06,062
I'm actually not the Gao
family's daughter.

423
00:40:07,371 --> 00:40:08,838
I'm only...

424
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:12,132
their maid.

425
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:16,340
But I love being with you...

426
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:18,139
and don't want you to look down upon me.

427
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:21,581
That's why I made up such that
stupid story.

428
00:40:22,286 --> 00:40:24,379
Who else can verify what you said?

429
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:27,784
No.

430
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:30,051
We can!

431
00:40:30,294 --> 00:40:30,783
We rescued her...

432
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:32,553
from the lair of the desert's bandits.

433
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:34,924
She'd have died if we it weren't for us!

434
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:37,123
- Yes! Yes...
- Sure! We rescued her...

435
00:40:37,335 --> 00:40:38,529
Brother Wang,

436
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:40,265
I did tell lies.

437
00:40:41,138 --> 00:40:43,265
But please don't banish me! Will you?

438
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:44,869
I don't want to be alone.

439
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:48,276
Get up.

440
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:51,813
With me here, nobody dare bully you.

441
00:40:57,421 --> 00:40:58,945
I'll chop your hands off
and see if you're a demon!

442
00:40:59,323 --> 00:41:00,483
Brother Yong!

443
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:03,486
What're you doing? Are you crazy?

444
00:41:03,728 --> 00:41:05,525
I just tested her.
It's the back of the blade!

445
00:41:08,165 --> 00:41:10,895
I don't care what tricks you played.
Xiaowei is my family!

446
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:14,129
Your family... so what about Peirong?

447
00:41:14,538 --> 00:41:17,769
Peirong is your wife!
She's been worried about you every day!

448
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:21,642
Brother Yong.

449
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:25,546
You still care that Peirong
had chosen me!

450
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:26,948
Bastard!

451
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:29,679
I'm not happy!

452
00:41:30,454 --> 00:41:31,887
Coz Peirong has chosen the wrong one!

453
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:33,555
You cold-hearted thing!

454
00:41:33,758 --> 00:41:35,282
They're already married.

455
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:36,858
I think you'd better give up.

456
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:38,323
Shut up!

457
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,627
Obsessed by that woman!

458
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:41,924
You've never seen a woman?

459
00:41:42,133 --> 00:41:43,464
Pang Yong!

460
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:46,931
It's my private matter.
It's none of yours!

461
00:41:47,138 --> 00:41:48,765
I must care about the demon's case!

462
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:55,972
This is a section of tail
from a fox spirit.

463
00:41:56,847 --> 00:42:00,943
Whenever a demon shows up, it glares.

464
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:14,297
It's always glaring. So we're
all demons?

465
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:18,761
I'm a "Demon Buster".
Everything I said is real!

466
00:42:19,437 --> 00:42:21,530
I don't believe it. Who does?

467
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:23,270
The ghosts do!

468
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:26,638
I do!

469
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:31,247
I saw it with my own eyes!

470
00:42:32,316 --> 00:42:33,476
She knows black magic.

471
00:42:35,252 --> 00:42:36,617
I hurt her hand by accident

472
00:42:38,189 --> 00:42:40,180
and it healed up at once.

473
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:46,591
Later I told this to the Taoist priest.

474
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:51,892
He said you're a demon with high power.

475
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:57,299
On the very next day, he died...

476
00:43:01,445 --> 00:43:06,678
I've been staying with you.
I know more than anyone else.

477
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,085
I have an idea!

478
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:15,953
There's a "mark" on each demon,

479
00:43:17,461 --> 00:43:19,122
like human's birthmark.

480
00:43:20,664 --> 00:43:23,827
Dare you let us examine you?

481
00:43:26,036 --> 00:43:28,368
Miss Demon, are you scared?

482
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:31,732
Dare you?

483
00:43:33,577 --> 00:43:34,601
I dare!

484
00:43:35,746 --> 00:43:38,510
I do as long as you won't suspect me.

485
00:44:31,936 --> 00:44:33,426
Satisfied?

486
00:44:41,145 --> 00:44:43,272
Nothing to do with her.
They're all my ideas.

487
00:44:46,584 --> 00:44:47,778
I still have one more idea.

488
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:49,212
Are you finished?

489
00:44:51,755 --> 00:44:53,222
For a fox spirit to sustain
their human form,

490
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:54,752
they must swallow human hearts,

491
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,759
which is why there're so many deaths
with their hearts removed.

492
00:44:57,962 --> 00:44:59,054
Are you finished?

493
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:02,426
- Sure...
- Are you wasting our time?

494
00:45:04,134 --> 00:45:05,032
What you mean is...

495
00:45:05,235 --> 00:45:06,793
If she has no heart to eat,

496
00:45:07,504 --> 00:45:08,801
she'll reveal her true form?

497
00:45:15,946 --> 00:45:17,573
Let's watch Miss Xiaowei for a while!

498
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:23,245
See if she'll become a demon
with no hearts to eat.

499
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:29,716
I must let you know that you're wrong!

500
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:38,058
Get in.

501
00:45:40,437 --> 00:45:41,563
I understand that

502
00:45:43,374 --> 00:45:44,705
you're just concerned about me.

503
00:45:49,513 --> 00:45:50,912
I'm sorry.

504
00:45:52,282 --> 00:45:55,342
You should apologize so Xiaowei.

505
00:46:22,713 --> 00:46:23,873
I'm so sorry...

506
00:46:25,582 --> 00:46:27,379
I'm sorry for you, sister.

507
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,950
I know why you suspect that I'm a demon.

508
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:36,449
You worry if I'll steal Brother Wang.

509
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:42,963
Yes, I really love him.

510
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:50,767
But don't get me wrong.
I'll never oppose you.

511
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:54,304
Please accept me as his concubine...

512
00:47:06,356 --> 00:47:07,584
Please...

513
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:22,133
Xiaowei, just get up.

514
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:27,243
Sister Peirong, I beg you...

515
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:35,375
Xiaowei.

516
00:47:39,556 --> 00:47:40,989
There is only one Mrs. Wang.

517
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:47,762
You should be so tired today.

518
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:56,130
Xiaorou.

519
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:57,364
Yes!

520
00:47:58,142 --> 00:47:59,575
Take Xiaowei back to her room.

521
00:48:01,612 --> 00:48:02,704
Miss Xiaowei...

522
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:11,548
Stick with her!
Even when she's in the toilet!

523
00:48:31,942 --> 00:48:33,876
Please get some rest, Miss Xiaowei.

524
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:35,712
Okay.

525
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:39,800
I have some good dim sum. You like it?

526
00:49:40,043 --> 00:49:41,442
No, thanks!

527
00:49:42,412 --> 00:49:43,845
You might try to poison me!

528
00:49:47,951 --> 00:49:50,351
Do you still suspect me?

529
00:49:51,054 --> 00:49:52,544
I never suspected you.

530
00:49:53,724 --> 00:49:55,419
I am sure you are!

531
00:50:29,426 --> 00:50:30,791
General! General!

532
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:32,626
The heart digger has done it again!

533
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:36,663
Brother Yong.

534
00:50:38,435 --> 00:50:40,665
The guy killed some more people
in a couple of days.

535
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:43,567
Our soldiers are placed
everywhere, but...

536
00:50:44,341 --> 00:50:45,899
we still can't catch him.

537
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:48,909
You can't catch him. He's a demon!

538
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,211
Demon?

539
00:50:54,651 --> 00:50:56,516
Don't you mean Xiaowei's a demon?

540
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:58,344
You've been watching her all day.

541
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:00,079
Why still deaths outside?

542
00:51:01,792 --> 00:51:03,350
Who says there's only one demon?

543
00:51:04,995 --> 00:51:06,155
Another one?

544
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:10,130
Wang Sheng, what do you think?

545
00:51:13,637 --> 00:51:17,539
I think he should be a kung fu expert.

546
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:19,804
Only you can seize him.

547
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:22,442
I sincerely hope you to stay.

548
00:51:24,681 --> 00:51:25,875
I, Peirong,

549
00:51:26,216 --> 00:51:28,616
and all the citizens here
will thank you.

550
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:32,586
Please.

551
00:51:35,325 --> 00:51:36,587
Peirong.

552
00:51:37,627 --> 00:51:40,926
You persuade Brother Yong.

553
00:51:47,004 --> 00:51:48,198
I'm sorry.

554
00:51:48,872 --> 00:51:51,466
Don't say sorry.
I don't want you to say sorry.

555
00:51:52,075 --> 00:51:53,269
You've done nothing wrong.

556
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:57,444
I'm back...

557
00:51:57,647 --> 00:51:59,274
only to see that you're happy.

558
00:51:59,516 --> 00:52:00,710
You look good, aren't you?

559
00:52:02,652 --> 00:52:04,085
Brother Yong.

560
00:52:04,554 --> 00:52:06,078
You're the best man ever.

561
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:09,481
Hope you'll find a woman better than me.

562
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:11,791
Don't worry.

563
00:52:11,995 --> 00:52:14,020
I've been traveling around alone
very well.

564
00:52:14,231 --> 00:52:16,495
So free. And nothing to be anxious.

565
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,366
Let's talk later.
I'll go help Wang Sheng now.

566
00:52:22,172 --> 00:52:23,537
Stupid man!

567
00:52:27,077 --> 00:52:31,138
Miss Xia Bing, he's a good man.

568
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:34,143
Do treat him better.

569
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:41,154
Don't lump me with him!
It's not what you think.

570
00:52:42,426 --> 00:52:45,554
I'm not interested in
such a stupid shit.

571
00:52:47,564 --> 00:52:54,629
Put on our golden armors
and we're forever the strongest.

572
00:52:55,372 --> 00:53:02,403
Sacrifice our lives for the sake
of our parents.

573
00:53:03,046 --> 00:53:06,538
Spill our blood...

574
00:53:17,294 --> 00:53:18,591
Xiahou Xiang

575
00:53:21,765 --> 00:53:24,825
This time, I get plotted...

576
00:53:35,479 --> 00:53:37,242
Mistress...

577
00:53:37,447 --> 00:53:40,439
My God! It's heard that Pang Yong
killed Xiahou Xiang!

578
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:41,514
Impossible!

579
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:43,379
The Mo Zhui guys personally saw it.

580
00:53:48,525 --> 00:53:49,583
Xiahou Xiang is dead.

581
00:53:53,196 --> 00:53:54,561
I know.

582
00:53:56,199 --> 00:53:57,689
They suspect that I killed him.

583
00:53:59,803 --> 00:54:00,929
I know it as well.

584
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:04,800
I don't believe, though.

585
00:54:07,177 --> 00:54:08,439
Under such circumstances,

586
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:11,346
you'll suffer if you follow me.

587
00:54:13,717 --> 00:54:15,207
Who follows you?

588
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,979
Now you're following me
to catch the demon!

589
00:54:21,191 --> 00:54:23,785
Catch it? Are you confident?

590
00:54:26,997 --> 00:54:28,294
No, for sure!

591
00:54:30,467 --> 00:54:32,298
When had I ever been confident?

592
00:54:34,004 --> 00:54:35,869
But why are you still after him?

593
00:54:36,173 --> 00:54:37,504
You're not scared of death?

594
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:45,914
I'm a Demon Buster.

595
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:48,774
It's my duty.

596
00:54:56,593 --> 00:54:59,027
His horse is still here.
He must still be in the city.

597
00:54:59,329 --> 00:55:00,455
You bring a team there.

598
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:01,653
- Yes!
- Let's go!

599
00:55:01,865 --> 00:55:03,492
- Go!
- Take care, general!

600
00:55:12,876 --> 00:55:13,934
Get some sleep.

601
00:55:14,444 --> 00:55:16,878
I'll go nowhere tonight.
I'll stay with you.

602
00:55:32,729 --> 00:55:33,957
Don't worry.

603
00:55:35,398 --> 00:55:37,696
I don't believe Brother Yong'd
kill Xiahou Xiang, either.

604
00:55:38,868 --> 00:55:41,928
I'll find him and ask him thoroughly.

605
00:55:58,455 --> 00:55:59,649
I want to ask you,

606
00:56:01,925 --> 00:56:03,620
will you love her...

607
00:56:06,263 --> 00:56:07,958
if Xiaowei is not a demon?

608
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:13,696
How can Xiaowei be a demon?

609
00:56:30,453 --> 00:56:33,820
Okay... I promise.

610
00:56:35,025 --> 00:56:37,493
I'll get more Taoist priests
to check her out,

611
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:38,986
okay?

612
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:41,794
Okay?

613
00:56:44,367 --> 00:56:45,800
You haven't answered me yet.

614
00:56:54,177 --> 00:56:55,610
Will you love her?

615
00:57:07,557 --> 00:57:09,149
Whether she's a demon or woman,

616
00:57:11,828 --> 00:57:13,090
I won't.

617
00:57:15,665 --> 00:57:16,654
Rest assured.

618
00:59:27,464 --> 00:59:28,829
What's up?

619
00:59:31,668 --> 00:59:32,896
Brother Wang.

620
00:59:35,538 --> 00:59:37,267
I think I need to go.

621
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:41,607
I've said too many that
I shouldn't have.

622
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:45,642
You forgot it?

623
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:48,179
I said I'll look after you,

624
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:49,851
like my sister.

625
00:59:50,086 --> 00:59:51,610
Peirong will understand!

626
00:59:56,793 --> 01:00:00,354
Am I really that... useless?

627
01:00:01,331 --> 01:00:02,491
How could you be?

628
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:07,668
Everyone can see that Gao Xiang,

629
01:00:07,904 --> 01:00:09,872
Jing Ping and Jing An
are attracted to you.

630
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:12,837
I think that nobody'll ever dislike you

631
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:16,040
in this whole world.

632
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:20,279
But I only want you to love me.

633
01:00:28,391 --> 01:00:30,859
Can I not even become your concubine?

634
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:41,867
It's me who's not qualified.

635
01:00:43,706 --> 01:00:46,470
Don't sell yourself short.
You shouldn't be my concubine.

636
01:00:47,377 --> 01:00:48,674
You should find a good man...

637
01:00:50,013 --> 01:00:53,346
who takes care of you and loves you.

638
01:00:53,783 --> 01:00:55,250
Right?

639
01:01:03,393 --> 01:01:05,156
Have you ever loved me?

640
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:31,513
I don't need anyone else.

641
01:01:33,122 --> 01:01:35,215
I don't need any status.

642
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:38,724
I just want to be your woman,

643
01:01:40,797 --> 01:01:42,287
even if just once...

644
01:03:08,651 --> 01:03:09,948
Are you okay?

645
01:03:27,937 --> 01:03:29,097
Alright.

646
01:03:29,906 --> 01:03:32,568
You needn't worry if Xiaowei's a demon.
Okay?

647
01:03:32,875 --> 01:03:34,342
What's wrong?

648
01:03:35,144 --> 01:03:36,736
Why were you staying in her room?

649
01:03:43,052 --> 01:03:43,484
I...

650
01:03:43,686 --> 01:03:45,244
- I just...
- Don't need to say it.

651
01:03:47,590 --> 01:03:49,581
I know she really loves you.

652
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:55,596
And I understand...

653
01:03:56,232 --> 01:03:57,665
It's not what you think...

654
01:03:58,267 --> 01:03:59,427
It's all my fault.

655
01:04:01,704 --> 01:04:04,298
As a wife, I was jealous, maybe.

656
01:04:06,809 --> 01:04:08,640
If you love her too,

657
01:04:11,114 --> 01:04:12,012
then make her your concubine.

658
01:04:12,215 --> 01:04:13,842
I don't!

659
01:04:26,095 --> 01:04:27,722
Let me finish my words.

660
01:04:36,739 --> 01:04:39,264
As her elder sister,
I'll decide it for her.

661
01:04:45,848 --> 01:04:47,509
It's you...

662
01:04:50,119 --> 01:04:52,110
who still don't believe I can do it.

663
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:58,993
General!

664
01:05:14,043 --> 01:05:15,670
Who let you come out?

665
01:05:18,114 --> 01:05:19,638
Don't forget you're a demon.

666
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:22,180
Don't shed a tear for a man.

667
01:05:23,052 --> 01:05:24,952
Now you're more stupid
than that stupid woman!

668
01:05:26,088 --> 01:05:27,715
You know I love him?

669
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:31,086
Do you know what's love,

670
01:05:31,661 --> 01:05:33,322
you fly eater?

671
01:05:34,897 --> 01:05:36,364
I know!

672
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:40,860
And I've told you, I love you.

673
01:05:41,070 --> 01:05:42,935
But I don't love you!

674
01:05:44,707 --> 01:05:48,165
I told you long ago.
You've been shameless enough to stay!

675
01:05:52,315 --> 01:05:56,217
Who gets you all those hearts
without me?

676
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:58,780
I'll live well without you!

677
01:05:59,288 --> 01:06:02,257
Now act like a man and leave.

678
01:06:03,025 --> 01:06:04,356
Get away!

679
01:06:14,203 --> 01:06:15,568
Okay.

680
01:06:17,506 --> 01:06:18,939
I'm sorry for what I've done.

681
01:06:21,377 --> 01:06:23,072
I'll never disturb you!

682
01:06:26,215 --> 01:06:27,546
Go!

683
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:12,457
Mistress...

684
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:31,312
Sister Peirong, still staying up?

685
01:07:31,747 --> 01:07:33,009
Sister Xiaowei.

686
01:07:33,215 --> 01:07:34,341
I think there's one thing...

687
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:37,315
I must talk with you.

688
01:07:57,773 --> 01:08:00,298
You find me... for something?

689
01:08:17,626 --> 01:08:19,218
Now you know it all.

690
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:29,504
Go tell everyone.
Those who know must die, after all.

691
01:08:41,684 --> 01:08:42,946
Brother Gao, let's take a look outside.

692
01:08:43,152 --> 01:08:43,550
Be careful.

693
01:08:43,753 --> 01:08:45,118
- Okay.
- Go!

694
01:08:46,922 --> 01:08:48,412
Mistress! Are you alright?

695
01:08:49,225 --> 01:08:50,214
I'm fine.

696
01:09:00,669 --> 01:09:01,897
What do you want?

697
01:09:10,579 --> 01:09:12,012
Not made up my mind yet.

698
01:09:14,483 --> 01:09:15,745
Brother Gao.

699
01:09:16,485 --> 01:09:16,883
Miss Xiaowei...

700
01:09:17,086 --> 01:09:18,417
Don't come in!

701
01:09:20,589 --> 01:09:23,649
Brother Gao,
Sister Peirong said she saw a demon.

702
01:09:23,859 --> 01:09:26,487
Demon? Where is it?

703
01:09:28,064 --> 01:09:28,860
Right here!

704
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:32,658
No!

705
01:09:39,408 --> 01:09:41,171
Didn't you say you like me?

706
01:09:41,444 --> 01:09:43,173
Can you give me your heart?

707
01:09:57,927 --> 01:10:00,157
Seen any demons eating a human heart?

708
01:10:13,242 --> 01:10:17,338
Brother Sheng loves you. Don't hurt him!

709
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:25,680
It's useless as long as you,
Mrs. Wang, is here.

710
01:10:27,556 --> 01:10:28,716
That's nothing!

711
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:33,060
I can let you be Mrs. Wang.

712
01:10:33,329 --> 01:10:34,853
Me?

713
01:10:36,665 --> 01:10:39,566
Can you guarantee that
you'll never come back?

714
01:10:41,637 --> 01:10:43,798
I've seen you eat a human heart.

715
01:10:44,473 --> 01:10:46,168
Can I still stay alive?

716
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:53,205
Go ahead kill me!

717
01:10:59,555 --> 01:11:01,216
You think I'm that stupid?

718
01:11:02,791 --> 01:11:04,588
If I kill you,

719
01:11:05,461 --> 01:11:09,795
Brother Wang'd miss you forever.

720
01:11:30,986 --> 01:11:32,419
Drink this up.

721
01:11:33,889 --> 01:11:38,087
Go admit to be a demon
killing all those guys.

722
01:11:41,664 --> 01:11:44,189
I'll be Mrs. Wang and you the demon.

723
01:11:54,944 --> 01:11:56,275
I can.

724
01:11:57,980 --> 01:11:59,948
But will you promise not to kill again?

725
01:12:01,383 --> 01:12:06,411
I'm a demon. I'll grow old if I don't.

726
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:20,598
Okay, I promise you.

727
01:12:21,370 --> 01:12:23,361
When I become Mrs. Wang,

728
01:12:23,772 --> 01:12:27,208
I'll stay with him,
grow old and die with him.

729
01:12:39,622 --> 01:12:41,055
You really love him?

730
01:12:41,957 --> 01:12:43,515
Yes, I do.

731
01:13:08,484 --> 01:13:10,008
Do keep your words.

732
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:14,253
If you regret, I'll kill everyone.

733
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:22,121
You don't even know what is love.

734
01:13:37,813 --> 01:13:41,408
A demon...

735
01:13:41,617 --> 01:13:43,084
Xiaorou! Xiaorou...

736
01:13:43,285 --> 01:13:45,219
Help! Help...

737
01:13:50,793 --> 01:13:52,260
Mistress...

738
01:13:52,795 --> 01:13:54,160
What's happening?

739
01:14:05,774 --> 01:14:08,368
Hey! Stop!

740
01:14:39,375 --> 01:14:40,239
Mistress, why is it you?

741
01:14:40,442 --> 01:14:43,502
I'm the demon. Go ahead kill me.

742
01:14:51,620 --> 01:14:52,780
You all stop moving!

743
01:14:52,988 --> 01:14:53,750
Back off!

744
01:14:53,956 --> 01:14:55,548
Or I'll kill you!

745
01:15:12,541 --> 01:15:15,874
Peirong, stand it! You'll be fine!

746
01:15:24,119 --> 01:15:26,815
Master! Mistress is really the demon!

747
01:15:27,022 --> 01:15:28,649
Xiaorou, don't talk anything nonsense.

748
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:33,821
Has Sister Peirong...
suffered from any strange disease?

749
01:15:34,463 --> 01:15:36,431
Not her? So who killed Brother Gao?

750
01:15:36,632 --> 01:15:37,326
Sure!

751
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:39,125
We must revenge Brother Gao!

752
01:15:52,114 --> 01:15:53,547
She seems to have suffered
from evil poison.

753
01:15:55,717 --> 01:15:57,878
It's graded by color.

754
01:15:58,287 --> 01:16:01,256
The lighter the color,
the more deadly it is.

755
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:06,327
White is therefore
the most poisonous of all.

756
01:16:07,329 --> 01:16:10,662
When the whole body turns white,
one must die.

757
01:16:12,468 --> 01:16:15,096
Do you have so many ways?
How to save her?

758
01:16:24,379 --> 01:16:26,677
You've woke up, Peirong.
Feeling better?

759
01:16:28,317 --> 01:16:29,944
You all leave me.

760
01:16:30,819 --> 01:16:32,446
Did Xiaowei do this?

761
01:16:33,889 --> 01:16:35,481
I myself...

762
01:16:37,392 --> 01:16:38,324
is the demon.

763
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:40,085
Don't speak nonsense!

764
01:16:40,796 --> 01:16:42,787
Don't worry. You'll be fine.

765
01:16:43,665 --> 01:16:46,156
She's a Demon Buster.
She must be able to help.

766
01:16:46,502 --> 01:16:48,333
Don't you have your family's treasure?

767
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:52,506
Sure. My grandpa left me a lot.

768
01:16:52,708 --> 01:16:55,040
I...

769
01:16:55,511 --> 01:16:56,910
Not these.

770
01:16:57,145 --> 01:16:57,474
Your grandpa...

771
01:16:57,679 --> 01:16:59,579
he gave me that one treasure.

772
01:16:59,915 --> 01:17:01,280
Sure...

773
01:17:02,284 --> 01:17:04,616
Look! She really has the treasure!

774
01:17:04,820 --> 01:17:05,980
It can destroy the demons!

775
01:17:06,321 --> 01:17:07,413
Come to think of it.

776
01:17:07,623 --> 01:17:09,784
My grandpa told me,
once the demon is killed...

777
01:17:09,992 --> 01:17:12,859
the dark magic cast on human body
should vanish...

778
01:17:13,195 --> 01:17:14,059
Can you hear it?

779
01:17:14,263 --> 01:17:15,161
Yes!

780
01:17:15,831 --> 01:17:19,494
You'd have used it if it
was really useful.

781
01:17:23,505 --> 01:17:25,234
You cannot beat her.

782
01:17:26,875 --> 01:17:28,035
Don't worry.

783
01:17:29,177 --> 01:17:33,375
The killings should end with me.

784
01:17:37,019 --> 01:17:40,921
Stop speaking nonsense.
I will have the way.

785
01:17:56,204 --> 01:17:57,228
Peirong!

786
01:17:57,573 --> 01:17:58,801
Peirong!

787
01:18:01,076 --> 01:18:02,771
Peirong, I've taken back my sword!

788
01:18:02,978 --> 01:18:04,946
You know how powerful it is?

789
01:18:05,414 --> 01:18:07,279
With it, I never lost!

790
01:18:07,482 --> 01:18:09,245
You'll be saved once I kill the demon!

791
01:18:09,818 --> 01:18:11,877
I'll chop her into pieces! Okay?

792
01:18:27,436 --> 01:18:28,494
I'll ask you one more time.

793
01:18:30,072 --> 01:18:30,970
You're sure it's Xiaowei?

794
01:18:31,173 --> 01:18:32,902
I don't want any innocent deaths!

795
01:18:35,143 --> 01:18:36,075
You still don't believe me now?

796
01:18:36,278 --> 01:18:37,836
Okay, I'm going.

797
01:18:38,146 --> 01:18:39,078
You take care of Peirong!

798
01:18:40,949 --> 01:18:41,745
You're really going?

799
01:18:41,950 --> 01:18:42,678
I must go for sure.

800
01:18:42,884 --> 01:18:45,011
You can't! You cannot kill her!

801
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:46,250
Don't kid me!

802
01:18:46,455 --> 01:18:48,423
Your grandpa cut off
the fox spirit's tail.

803
01:18:48,624 --> 01:18:49,591
This sword's great.

804
01:18:49,791 --> 01:18:51,156
How could I not kill her?

805
01:18:51,593 --> 01:18:54,153
My grandpa cut her using his own blood!

806
01:18:57,199 --> 01:18:58,188
We, the "Demon Busters",

807
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:02,336
have bloods
which can specially kill demons.

808
01:19:03,839 --> 01:19:05,431
If you do want to kill Xiaowei,

809
01:19:06,675 --> 01:19:08,142
bring me there.

810
01:19:45,914 --> 01:19:47,245
Wang Sheng,

811
01:19:47,916 --> 01:19:49,508
do you know what's happening?

812
01:20:11,239 --> 01:20:13,104
Miss, don't get there!

813
01:20:18,413 --> 01:20:19,778
Are you really a demon?

814
01:20:35,030 --> 01:20:36,497
Yes.

815
01:20:42,304 --> 01:20:44,169
You killed Gao Xiang?

816
01:20:58,086 --> 01:20:59,576
I killed everyone.

817
01:20:59,788 --> 01:21:02,552
We must revenge Brother Gao!

818
01:21:02,758 --> 01:21:04,316
You want to kill her, kill me first.

819
01:21:04,626 --> 01:21:05,490
Revenge Brother Gao!

820
01:21:05,694 --> 01:21:06,786
An eye for an eye!

821
01:21:06,995 --> 01:21:11,091
Revenge Brother Gao!

822
01:21:11,299 --> 01:21:12,857
Shut up!

823
01:21:14,302 --> 01:21:16,395
She's a demon. I must kill her!

824
01:21:27,916 --> 01:21:33,218
But how can I give her up as a husband?

825
01:21:39,227 --> 01:21:40,091
Put down the knife!

826
01:21:42,097 --> 01:21:43,394
Wang Sheng!

827
01:21:43,865 --> 01:21:44,627
Put down the knife first!

828
01:21:44,833 --> 01:21:46,130
Peirong

829
01:21:46,334 --> 01:21:50,794
I must take
all the responsibility with you!

830
01:21:52,073 --> 01:21:53,199
I'm a demon.

831
01:21:54,276 --> 01:21:56,938
I killed so many and I deserve it.

832
01:21:57,579 --> 01:21:59,206
You're my wife.

833
01:22:02,284 --> 01:22:07,586
Whether you're demon or woman,
I love you.

834
01:22:09,658 --> 01:22:11,319
I love you forever!

835
01:22:15,664 --> 01:22:16,926
No.

836
01:22:29,144 --> 01:22:30,441
Promise me.

837
01:22:31,847 --> 01:22:33,576
Live well.

838
01:22:35,450 --> 01:22:37,008
Live on for me...

839
01:22:59,808 --> 01:23:01,799
Evil woman!

840
01:23:08,917 --> 01:23:13,547
You all see it? She is the real demon!

841
01:23:14,189 --> 01:23:18,091
You all see it? She is the real demon!

842
01:23:40,849 --> 01:23:42,248
What? Leave me!

843
01:23:43,285 --> 01:23:44,616
You can't kill her!

844
01:23:45,587 --> 01:23:46,645
What're you doing?

845
01:23:47,522 --> 01:23:48,682
Go!

846
01:25:12,507 --> 01:25:14,134
Give her back to me.

847
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:20,145
If you love me,

848
01:25:21,850 --> 01:25:23,579
give Peirong back to me.

849
01:25:25,787 --> 01:25:27,914
If you love her so much,

850
01:25:29,557 --> 01:25:31,923
why don't you die with her?

851
01:25:33,061 --> 01:25:34,426
I'll die.

852
01:25:37,499 --> 01:25:39,296
Get her here!

853
01:25:42,437 --> 01:25:43,836
Will you believe her?

854
01:25:44,172 --> 01:25:45,537
If Peirong dies,

855
01:25:47,075 --> 01:25:48,702
I'll die with her.

856
01:25:51,679 --> 01:25:53,704
If she comes back to life,

857
01:25:56,985 --> 01:25:58,782
Tell her that...

858
01:26:01,356 --> 01:26:03,153
I haven't been a good husband.

859
01:26:04,859 --> 01:26:06,622
I've failed to protect her.

860
01:26:10,765 --> 01:26:12,357
I love you,

861
01:26:16,504 --> 01:26:18,233
but I'm married with Peirong.

862
01:26:20,108 --> 01:26:21,507
No!

863
01:26:21,876 --> 01:26:23,275
Brother Sheng!

864
01:26:44,966 --> 01:26:46,126
What's this?

865
01:26:59,147 --> 01:27:01,638
You saved them
with the thousand-year spirit!

866
01:27:03,218 --> 01:27:04,446
You're a demon.

867
01:27:04,953 --> 01:27:05,510
They won't let you go...

868
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:07,153
even if you saved them!

869
01:27:08,189 --> 01:27:10,350
How can a demon gets true love
in the world?

870
01:27:16,464 --> 01:27:17,726
I'll get you out of here...

871
01:27:19,033 --> 01:27:20,364
once I kill them all!

872
01:28:38,513 --> 01:28:40,447
Look! He has a shadow!

873
01:30:08,636 --> 01:30:09,603
Take it!

874
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:40,131
Hurry up! Kill him!

875
01:30:47,909 --> 01:30:49,308
Do it! Just do it...

876
01:30:49,811 --> 01:30:52,371
It doesn't matter if I die.
You must kill him!

877
01:30:52,714 --> 01:30:55,410
Take Peirong's spirit back and save her.

878
01:30:55,850 --> 01:30:58,216
Kill me. Do it quickly!

879
01:30:58,853 --> 01:31:00,252
Do it...!

880
01:31:21,909 --> 01:31:25,868
Xiaowei!

881
01:32:54,569 --> 01:32:56,833
Many hatreds in the world...

882
01:32:58,339 --> 01:33:01,001
can be finished without killing.

883
01:33:04,178 --> 01:33:05,975
I now realize why...

884
01:33:08,616 --> 01:33:09,981
I couldn't exert all my energy...

885
01:33:10,184 --> 01:33:11,879
of a Demon Buster.

886
01:33:15,156 --> 01:33:17,283
It's because I've been bearing hatred.

887
01:33:24,932 --> 01:33:26,331
Go ahead save them.

888
01:35:38,566 --> 01:35:39,965
General, general...

889
01:35:43,070 --> 01:35:44,401
Are you okay, general?

890
01:35:45,740 --> 01:35:47,367
Master, are you okay?

891
01:35:48,075 --> 01:35:49,064
- Brother Dabao, are you okay?
- Mistress...

892
01:35:49,276 --> 01:35:50,675
- General, are you fine?
- Brother Dabao...

893
01:35:50,878 --> 01:35:52,709
Mistress, it's fine now.

894
01:36:12,066 --> 01:36:13,693
Brother Yong!

895
01:36:15,202 --> 01:36:16,328
Brother Yong!

896
01:36:16,604 --> 01:36:17,502
Brother Yong!

897
01:36:17,705 --> 01:36:18,228
What's wrong with you?
Brother Yong!

898
01:36:18,439 --> 01:36:19,167
Wake up... Brother Yong!

899
01:36:19,373 --> 01:36:20,931
- Brother Yong!
- Wake up...

900
01:36:21,208 --> 01:36:24,336
Brother Yong! Wake up...

901
01:36:25,346 --> 01:36:27,211
Brother Yong...

902
01:36:27,415 --> 01:36:31,545
Don't shake me anymore
or I'm surely dying!

903
01:36:31,852 --> 01:36:33,581
I'm so tired after the long fight.

904
01:36:55,910 --> 01:36:57,343
You're sure you don't want to stay?

905
01:37:01,549 --> 01:37:03,176
There're still many places I want to go.

906
01:37:06,053 --> 01:37:07,315
Me too.

907
01:37:17,965 --> 01:37:19,125
I'm leaving.

908
01:38:01,175 --> 01:38:02,767
Take care!

909
01:38:10,351 --> 01:38:11,409
Where're you going?

910
01:38:12,987 --> 01:38:14,978
The world's so big.
I can go wherever I want.

911
01:38:15,356 --> 01:38:17,085
You seem to have a gift
for catching demons.

912
01:38:17,625 --> 01:38:18,649
Hey

913
01:38:19,727 --> 01:38:21,718
Wanna catch demons with me?

914
01:38:51,392 --> 01:38:52,859
Why don't you call me master?

915
01:38:53,594 --> 01:38:54,754
You're not qualified...

916
01:38:54,962 --> 01:38:56,361
with all those mediocre skills.

917
01:38:57,097 --> 01:38:59,065
I'm more experienced than you.

918
01:39:02,102 --> 01:39:03,262
What're you looking at?

919
01:39:04,038 --> 01:39:06,506
Take off your cap
and you look very much like a woman.

920
01:39:09,276 --> 01:39:10,368
Not bad, not bad!

921
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:42,400
