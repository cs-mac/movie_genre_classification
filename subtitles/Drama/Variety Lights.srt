1
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:04,227
VARIETY LIGHTS

2
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:43,756
Captain, if I don't catch her,
At least I have my wife

3
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:48,391
Who looks like a parrot,
And even has an aquarium

4
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:53,428
Who saw my pretty, pretty, pretty
Pretty parrot

5
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:58,206
Green, yellow, with a rolled beak
She's so pretty, only for me

6
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:08,411
I've lost my goose, she was
So beautiful...

7
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:13,515
When she ran she looked like a ball
So beautiful...

8
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:21,392
But it doesn't matter...
I'm happy enough if I catch her

9
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:28,803
... with my girl, she's crooked
low, and her neck sticks out

10
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:33,340
She looks like a goose, pretty...

11
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:41,714
When she runs she looks like a ball
She's so pretty, just for me...

12
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:58,764
Come here immediately, the hotel
owner confiscated all the takings

13
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:01,270
- The hotel owner? - Yes
- Who knows him? -Come here

14
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:56,661
Variety lights, shining like stars
Because I love you so

15
00:04:57,063 --> 00:05:03,332
The magic of love is in the heart

16
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:08,363
Variety lights,
May you have love and happiness

17
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,210
This is happiness...

18
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:35,917
I had to give another encore,
the audience loved me

19
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,422
- You are so fanatical
- The audience must be satisfied

20
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:44,433
But how can you give my
company's pay to a stranger?

21
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:48,106
We have the company's administrator
who knows the code

22
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:51,675
I'm a stranger? You've never
seen this face before?

23
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:53,937
- What happened?
- The money was confiscated

24
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,180
Confiscated?

25
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:59,715
- Young man, you can't take my pay
- Mine either

26
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:02,819
Sir, they've paid the debt, my
friend here fed you for two years,

27
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:05,490
and after two years he hasn't
received his pay yet

28
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:09,684
- It's a postal delay
- A postal delay? Here's the rest

29
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:13,729
One moment, young man, I must
be paid, I'm a national star

30
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:16,594
And I sweat blood up here
and don't get a penny

31
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:18,698
Excuse me, but this is disgusting

32
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:21,371
How can we all go, dear sir?

33
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:23,565
- Why should I care?
- You should care

34
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:27,903
- There's nothing we can do
- You must be reasonable

35
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:34,419
I'm cancelling my contract,
and I want my pay. I'm a star

36
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:36,451
You want your pay? Here

37
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:39,682
Get your hands off me, I worked
even with a high temperature

38
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:43,123
- Yes, we have a fever
- What do you want from me?

39
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:48,093
It's a debt we all have together,
we all ate, you most of all

40
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,393
- Me? Me?
- The money

41
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,398
- I don't remember - You don't?
- I want my pay

42
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:52,964
Wretch

43
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:56,473
Wretch? Cuckold

44
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:00,174
Peace

45
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:04,305
Let me explain, director,
don't go away, just one word

46
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,211
- Excuse me, are you the impresario?
- What impresario?

47
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,272
We'll have to withdraw
from our savings

48
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:30,064
No need for that

49
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:33,534
Take this

50
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,879
- What is it?
- An aspirin for your fever

51
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,455
- Do I have one?
- A little

52
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:47,616
The dog is hungry

53
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:59,166
- Don't throw yourself on me.
- Who is touching you?

54
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:01,338
Write down your regrets

55
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,203
You write them, and say
we don't have a penny

56
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:07,277
- When will you come back?
- How should I know?

57
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:13,179
The train is arriving, come on

58
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:17,054
Master, master, the train

59
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:27,733
Alfredo, this is Righetto's bicycle

60
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:29,730
- Can you return it tomorrow?
- Fine

61
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:31,467
- Thank you, bye
- Bye

62
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:35,773
Come on! Damn that dog, damn it

63
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:39,106
Come on, hurry up,
the train is leaving

64
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:45,678
I only have 10 tickets, you and the
maestro have to stay in the toilet

65
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,783
- Really?
- Damn

66
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:11,433
Are you the boss?

67
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:16,734
Look

68
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:40,929
If you want, I'll stay with you

69
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:44,801
This is my diploma

70
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:49,071
I danced for 70 hours.
I had to stop

71
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:51,971
because the others did,
but I wasn't tired at all

72
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:54,507
I won a prize for interpretive dance,

73
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:57,642
a little bit Indian

74
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:09,256
That's me in a bathing suit,
I was elected the Beach Queen

75
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:13,190
You can't see well, but look

76
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,896
They wrote in the newspaper
that I have legs like Maresca

77
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:27,377
Go back to your compartment,
I'll join you in a moment

78
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:39,481
Let's stay here,
we can talk easier

79
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:42,418
They did a good job
giving you the prize

80
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:48,489
You have the most beautiful legs
and I know what I'm talking about

81
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:50,425
I'm a talent scout

82
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:54,595
Show biz is hard,
but I always had faith

83
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:05,478
You shouldn't do that, all I want
is to get into show business

84
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:08,146
It's always been my passion,
since childhood

85
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:15,392
If you don't want to help me, fine,
I'll manage on my own, like always

86
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:21,530
I don't know how to say it
but once I saw you on stage,

87
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:23,665
I felt I could trust you

88
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,594
I thought you would understand me,

89
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:29,800
that you could help me,
at least in the beginning

90
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:33,372
I'm a fool, I was so wrong

91
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:39,276
My dear, theater is
a very serious thing

92
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:04,767
- Is the ticket collector coming?
- Spanzia and I want to breathe

93
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:05,805
If you would rather die...

94
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:56,350
- Hey, Remo, come here
- What is it?

95
00:14:56,862 --> 00:15:00,821
He wants money for the ride.
The owner said nothing to him

96
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:03,929
We want respect,
that's in the contract

97
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:09,138
Good man, didn't the owner
charge you to take my company?

98
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:11,568
- No - Will you take us?
- No

99
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:16,304
- What a mess
- He'll tell you later. Get out

100
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:19,380
- No, I need the money
- Don't you have any?

101
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:21,076
- Do you?
- And how...

102
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:24,447
Well, I know a shortcut,
in a half hour we'll be there

103
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,158
It's 3 miles. Tonight you'll
dance the boogie-woogie

104
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:31,793
- What agony, this fat man
- It won't end here, you hack

105
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:36,491
Are you moving?

106
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:51,477
Hey, look how pretty they are

107
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:07,627
That's my savings account, too

108
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,263
It's in both names,
these are our savings

109
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:12,930
Look, it's better to change
the subject before I get mad

110
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:15,001
How ungrateful.
Our savings?

111
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:19,170
- 50 thousand...
- You invested only 200

112
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:21,843
49 thousand and 800 are mine

113
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:26,984
And if it were the opposite?
You have only given 200

114
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:32,013
Anyhow, we only touch it in 10
years when we open the market

115
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:36,623
- Sure, I'll be selling salami
- Look, he's hiding something

116
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,754
But what's this bastard come to?

117
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:42,530
How beautiful these creatures
have been

118
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:46,571
for a hundred years.
Holy saints, holy saints

119
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:49,431
It's seems only yesterday
I had my first communion

120
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:50,906
Yesterday ...

121
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:56,911
I love you more, a mild sentiment

122
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:58,717
When will we get there?

123
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:03,581
In the divine cry,
the silence of... Dante

124
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:06,515
Carletto, you're shameless

125
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,621
Stop it with those hands

126
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,128
I'll take off my shoes

127
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:22,833
A carriage

128
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:41,123
Are you going to town?
Get on then, it's here for you

129
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:45,224
Miss, my company thanks you

130
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:47,322
Get on

131
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:50,397
Move it

132
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:57,942
You're very kind, thank you.
May I? Melina Amour, artist

133
00:17:58,143 --> 00:18:00,771
Valeria del Sole, artist.
I'm here with my fiancee

134
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:03,637
Move over there a bit

135
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:05,312
Look at her

136
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:13,215
All aboard

137
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:54,728
How lovely, I'd love to be a dancer
so much

138
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:55,524
Really?

139
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:57,392
I spoke with the director

140
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:03,368
- This one wants to be a dancer
- What?

141
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:10,580
The director wants to make her
a dancer

142
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:12,008
He's crazy

143
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:18,045
What kind of ideas
did she give him

144
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:18,814
Who?

145
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:28,199
- Miss, there's a misunderstanding
- I think so too

146
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:30,125
I understand your passion
for show business,

147
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:34,133
but my company's administration
can't take on more staff

148
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,905
- It doesn't have to - Of course
- That's just what we need

149
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:42,677
No, no, why do you take her in?
We're falling apart here

150
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:44,712
We share the pay already

151
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:48,080
And it's already not enough for us

152
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:50,645
But the director told me...

153
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:53,153
- What director?
- Mr. Dal Monte

154
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:56,527
I told her

155
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:59,060
The girl has an artistic talent
that should be encouraged

156
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:02,524
- It's not only your money at stake
- Excuse me, then what is it?

157
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:05,669
I have been on stage for
30 years, and it's not

158
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:08,531
the first time I fired someone
- Fired? Who exactly did you fire?

159
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,674
Look, I don't want to get paid,
I'll work free for you

160
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:13,236
- And the food? - A place to sleep?
- And the train?

161
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,909
But who is she anyway? What does
she want? Who sent her here?

162
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:21,685
Go, go away babe. Come on, girls,
let's go, take this stuff

163
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:26,481
Do you want to be a dancer?
Stay home, as long as you have one

164
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:27,987
I wish I could

165
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,524
Right, get yourself a ticket
back home, and go

166
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:36,959
How will I pay for the ticket?
I don't have a penny left

167
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:40,367
Put it down

168
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:57,755
Commendatore, are you following
the theater lights?

169
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,858
- Good morning, commendatore
- What a pleasure

170
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,861
My dear commendatore,
always so young

171
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:09,022
Long time no see. But you were
always in my mind

172
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:11,102
Where is the company?

173
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:13,302
Oh Lord, here it is

174
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,503
But I wrote fifteen acts

175
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:21,342
Manager, manager of the company,
the theater contractor

176
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:22,605
A pleasure

177
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,980
- This is the programme you sent me
- Fine

178
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:33,053
- An international fantasy entertainer
- That's me

179
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:37,524
- Melina Amour
- Right there

180
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:41,696
Valeria del Sole, a possessed
show girl

181
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:44,096
- Here she is
- I am the king of songs

182
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:48,297
Francis and Denis,
the tango virtuosi

183
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,205
That's Checco and his lady

184
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:55,077
- Liv, famous imitator
- Checco's wife

185
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,415
- The audience favorite

186
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:00,844
Better to give up

187
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:04,017
You won't fool me anymore

188
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:07,792
The twelve dancers are seven.
See you tonight at pay time

189
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,089
Sir!

190
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:11,527
He counted me, too

191
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:14,290
Come on guys, let's rehearse

192
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:35,652
Ungrateful heart

193
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:44,119
You took my life

194
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:51,131
It's all history

195
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:59,038
And you don't think of me anymore

196
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:10,346
Stinking audience

197
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:12,382
And it's raining

198
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:19,657
They're too tight,
I've already tried them on

199
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:22,128
don't you see what you did?
- The microphone? -Over there

200
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:24,700
What is she doing?

201
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,070
Shut up, the contractor included
her in the show

202
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:31,297
And now everyone's in bikinis
on the island of song and love

203
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:32,804
Sweet Molokai

204
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:40,077
Oh, sweet Molokai

205
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:49,454
I would never forget you
The pearl of the Hawaiian islands

206
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:56,391
Over there, in the delight
Of that blue sky

207
00:23:57,736 --> 00:24:01,638
A song of passion...
- I don't know the steps -Go

208
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:06,841
A harmony of love for you

209
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,613
I would like to be back there

210
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:17,087
Never leaving you again

211
00:24:18,423 --> 00:24:28,059
You are the queen of my heart,
A paradise of happiness

212
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:32,563
Hawaii

213
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:01,495
- What happened?
- She was left there in her underwear

214
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:03,466
What have you done?

215
00:25:04,202 --> 00:25:07,296
How do I know?
My skirt was torn

216
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:10,100
You ugly fanatical parrot.
This donkey wants to be in the show

217
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:13,342
- I won't go out there anymore
- We'll discuss it tomorrow

218
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:15,873
But it's not my fault

219
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:18,511
You, it's your turn.
Come on, hurry up

220
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:30,591
Now, "A mysterious girl" presented
by the magician Edison Will

221
00:25:48,446 --> 00:25:49,242
Get lost

222
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:53,950
Ladies and gentlemen, before
the civil authority and soldiers

223
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:57,550
- I will now perform an experiment
beyond science

224
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:40,259
And now, gentlemen,
Loca Spazia will sing for you

225
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:42,192
"Beautiful dreamer"

226
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:47,535
What do these donkeys want?

227
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:51,967
It's my turn now,
the show is saved

228
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,543
And now, everyone to Spain
with Francis and Denis

229
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:24,666
Start playing "El Muchacho"

230
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,128
20 years in show business and
this never happened to me

231
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:47,363
- Get lost
- I am Melina Amour. The Melina Amour

232
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:49,055
- These ways aren't civil
- Not civil?

233
00:27:57,942 --> 00:28:00,968
"A REPEAT PERFORMANCE"

234
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:09,748
Don Pedrito, what a rich man
What a husband

235
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:19,728
Oh mamma, mamma
You know why my heart's beating?

236
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:23,224
I saw a handsome guy,
I saw a handsome guy

237
00:28:23,768 --> 00:28:27,966
Oh mummy, I'm so much in love

238
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:34,870
"AT GREAT REQUEST,
THlRD PERFORMANCE"

239
00:29:51,422 --> 00:29:53,253
Brava...

240
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:02,064
Ladies

241
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:04,590
Good evening...

242
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,461
- Who are you looking for?
- Are you the girl's father?

243
00:30:07,705 --> 00:30:10,139
Which girl? "I saw a handsome
guy, I saw a handsome guy..."

244
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:12,273
- The husband?

245
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,805
- So where is her dressing room?
- It's here, but wait

246
00:30:16,447 --> 00:30:18,506
Liliana, a man's looking for you

247
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:21,051
- She's getting dressed
- Who is it?

248
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:25,450
I am your fan, your biggest fan.
Brava...

249
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:29,855
Could you ask your friend
to accept a dinner invitation?

250
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:33,021
- I don't even know you
- It's all right. May I?

251
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:37,099
Attorney Renzo La Rosa... this is
Dr. B. Antonini, brilliant journalist

252
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,735
- The dancers of my company
- A beautiful company

253
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:48,874
Marvellous show. Where is the girl?
Here you are

254
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:51,508
- Agreed then?
- Where?

255
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:53,817
Where? My place, at my den

256
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:57,450
- Alone?
- If you want to bring... someone

257
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,721
I'd love to, of course

258
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:09,297
I'll write an article in my paper

259
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:13,162
We'll be out of the theater
in 5 minutes. Good evening

260
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,509
- And who'll take me back home?
- Good night

261
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,178
We'll all go then, young lady

262
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:23,742
- Where is the carriage?
- I sold it

263
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:26,780
A little stroll is good for your
appetite. And the rain stopped

264
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:28,547
Checco, wait for me

265
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:33,416
- What a beautiful moon
- Well, guys,

266
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:36,853
the train is leaving at 7:35.
Don't miss it

267
00:31:37,962 --> 00:31:39,327
I'm hungry

268
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:57,747
We'll be there in five minutes

269
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:00,710
Slowly, slowly. You can slip here

270
00:32:03,154 --> 00:32:05,213
This estate is so beautiful

271
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:22,390
Nice voice

272
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:28,138
Listen, listen to this passage

273
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:31,740
- I'm hungry
- The theater was my vocation,

274
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:33,571
if I'd studied

275
00:33:33,778 --> 00:33:37,509
- Is it still far?
- No, a few more minutes

276
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:55,565
Be careful, don't be afraid

277
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,095
Watch out, daddy

278
00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:20,284
Who's that?
Where is he taking us?

279
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:26,162
He's taking us to the North Pole.
I'll find a shortcut now

280
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:28,991
Don't move, don't move,
are you crazy? Keep walking

281
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,031
My shoes are broken

282
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:37,497
Here we are

283
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,408
We've arrived

284
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:42,572
We've finally arrived

285
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:47,714
You'll see now, you'll see the
villa. Our lawyer is great

286
00:34:48,286 --> 00:34:52,950
Come in friends, come in,
make yourselves at home, please

287
00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:57,158
How beautiful this property is,
it seems to be the Sforzesco Castle

288
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:14,801
Slowly...

289
00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:31,159
Hey, Checco, we have drinks here
tonight, have fun

290
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:27,966
I'll write an article

291
00:38:37,214 --> 00:38:39,546
Do you know what women called me
when I was young?

292
00:38:40,518 --> 00:38:40,984
"Sun"

293
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:46,946
The Milanese women, however, used
to call me "Dew Eyes"

294
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:10,605
A momento of this beautiful evening

295
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:21,191
Dear friends, it's very late

296
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:25,085
Please forgive us,
but we have to go

297
00:39:25,496 --> 00:39:28,363
- What? Why?
- Are you the ship's captain?

298
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:32,229
So what? It's 3 a.m. We have to
go to Rome to get a hotel

299
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:35,097
Hotel? But Mr. Renzo invited us
to sleep here

300
00:39:37,274 --> 00:39:38,605
Sleep here?

301
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:42,207
Yes, yes, there's room
for everybody here

302
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:44,974
There are 8 bedrooms, 8

303
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:51,187
And if you feel sleepy, you can
take a nap on that nice sofa

304
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,754
Do you hear that lovely waltz?

305
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:56,483
Excuse me, may I?

306
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:06,694
Please

307
00:40:12,443 --> 00:40:13,671
What a face

308
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:16,610
Angry with me?

309
00:40:19,216 --> 00:40:21,446
Why are you behaving like this?
Have I done anything wrong?

310
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:24,384
It has nothing to do with me

311
00:40:25,456 --> 00:40:26,821
Are you worried about me?

312
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:29,191
You are free

313
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:33,585
You're not my daughter.
I can judge you on stage

314
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:36,660
I can say that you don't dance well
because you don't

315
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,860
That you can't sing
because you can't

316
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:43,395
Maybe in a while, with hard work
I can set you up

317
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:47,769
as I've done with many other girls
but then, after that...

318
00:40:48,312 --> 00:40:52,043
you can do as you wish.
I have no right, have I?

319
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:30,510
I'm going over there

320
00:41:31,722 --> 00:41:32,882
Aren't you sleeping here?

321
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:36,389
No, I'd rather go over there,
good night

322
00:41:57,748 --> 00:41:58,510
- What happened?
- Where?

323
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:01,077
Why are you here?
What about her?

324
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:03,684
- Liliana is sleeping.
- Sleeping...

325
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:06,956
You should've stayed with her...

326
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:09,020
- Why?

327
00:42:09,593 --> 00:42:12,653
Because she's a young girl
and we're responsible for her

328
00:42:13,163 --> 00:42:14,858
I was the third wheel over there

329
00:42:15,299 --> 00:42:18,029
and instead we can stay
here together

330
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:20,631
I'm not tired at all

331
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:25,068
Checco, what a dinner

332
00:42:26,477 --> 00:42:27,375
Hug me

333
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:30,807
Your hands are freezing,
are you cold?

334
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:35,716
- Why were you the third?
- Those two have an agreement

335
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,415
That one is a slut, my dear,
worse than Valeria

336
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:41,587
Have you seen Valeria?
What a woman

337
00:42:42,927 --> 00:42:47,057
And the duke didn't know
how to turn her down

338
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:50,396
He's so polite, I told him
you were my husband

339
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:55,003
We'll get married sooner or later
won't we?

340
00:42:58,108 --> 00:42:58,699
What is it?

341
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:03,736
That? It's Mr. Renzo's door

342
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:06,543
He was down the hall,
waiting for me to leave

343
00:43:07,551 --> 00:43:08,279
It's not true

344
00:43:09,987 --> 00:43:11,249
Good night to all dreamers

345
00:43:11,822 --> 00:43:13,915
Excuse me, just a minute

346
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:17,252
- Where are you going?
- Wait...

347
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:28,097
Listen, excuse me...

348
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:31,032
Excuse me... listen...
Come here...

349
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:35,545
- What do you want?
- Just one minute, come

350
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:38,911
- What...? - Come here
- Don't move and leave me alone

351
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:44,247
- Quick
- She's not the type, you're mistaken

352
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:45,615
Get lost

353
00:43:46,857 --> 00:43:50,315
You're not getting in here.
She's just a child, shame on you

354
00:43:50,527 --> 00:43:51,585
Don't be ridiculous

355
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:58,795
- Who is it?
- You ate here,

356
00:43:59,003 --> 00:44:01,301
drank... what the hell
do you want? For Christ sake

357
00:44:01,672 --> 00:44:04,641
I ate, drank... I am a gentleman,
I'll pay for all, how much?

358
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:07,139
- Clown
- Tell me how much

359
00:44:07,344 --> 00:44:08,470
Clown

360
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:11,444
Mr. Checco...

361
00:44:15,019 --> 00:44:17,647
This beggar, ragamuffin clown

362
00:44:17,955 --> 00:44:19,718
I have to take orders
in my own house now

363
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:22,959
Out, everybody out

364
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:25,321
What have you done?

365
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:34,695
- Melina
- I'm here

366
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:36,922
Checco, help me

367
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:01,109
- Good-bye
- Good morning

368
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:06,783
Why do I work with this?
I work in costume, my friend

369
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:12,455
It's so good to see you. I came
just the other day. I'll call you

370
00:47:13,363 --> 00:47:15,354
- He was one of my team
- Really?

371
00:47:17,868 --> 00:47:19,495
- Maestro, dear maestro
- Who are you?

372
00:47:19,736 --> 00:47:21,761
- I heard you're forming a company
- Yes, good bye

373
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:24,565
May I introduce you:
Liliana Antonelli, we are a team

374
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:28,768
- Please I'm talking to the lady
- I'd like to show you some pictures

375
00:47:29,046 --> 00:47:32,504
- Leave me alone. Understand?
- All right...

376
00:47:32,749 --> 00:47:34,376
Calm down. What kind
of behavior is this?

377
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:37,176
Wait a second.
Sir... dear sir

378
00:47:37,621 --> 00:47:39,555
- ...just one word, please
- Tomorrow...

379
00:47:42,492 --> 00:47:43,459
Nice guy, you know?

380
00:47:47,898 --> 00:47:50,628
Yes, we'll find a way for an
agreement, no doubt about it

381
00:47:51,235 --> 00:47:53,328
Everything will be set up
just the way you want it

382
00:47:57,574 --> 00:47:59,269
- Are you done?
- One moment, miss

383
00:47:59,576 --> 00:48:01,305
It's all right, so long as
it stays on tonight

384
00:48:01,778 --> 00:48:04,076
When will you be back
tonight? I lock the door

385
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:07,478
- Give me the keys. You like it here?
- It's nice

386
00:48:08,518 --> 00:48:09,314
It's for me...

387
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:15,155
Hello? Mr. Checco?

388
00:48:15,859 --> 00:48:17,850
I'm ready. Hurry up because
it's getting late

389
00:48:19,196 --> 00:48:21,858
I rented it for a low price
but it looks very nice

390
00:48:22,466 --> 00:48:22,989
Fine

391
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:24,556
What?

392
00:48:25,602 --> 00:48:28,537
In 15 minutes, half an hour?

393
00:48:29,139 --> 00:48:31,039
Did you talk to Parmisano?

394
00:48:32,276 --> 00:48:35,803
- Well, did you or not?
- Yes, of course

395
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:39,408
He'll come. They'll all come,
it's a place for artists

396
00:48:40,617 --> 00:48:41,811
In 20 minutes then

397
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:46,416
- Mr. Edmondo, I demand my suit now

398
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:48,653
- For God's sake
- Don't you touch me

399
00:48:48,892 --> 00:48:54,762
Don't curse and don't be a hero,
I'm not a fool, tomorrow, tomorrow

400
00:48:55,132 --> 00:48:57,566
Enough now! When you pay
I'll give you the suit

401
00:48:57,801 --> 00:48:59,393
- When will you pay me?
- Leave it

402
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:00,194
Oh Lord

403
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:01,760
Wretch

404
00:49:03,674 --> 00:49:06,165
I'm closing the motel, you'll see
what I'll do to you

405
00:49:07,077 --> 00:49:09,841
Cry, cry, baby, it's good for you

406
00:49:11,048 --> 00:49:11,480
Cry

407
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:16,852
Good evening

408
00:49:19,256 --> 00:49:19,620
Thank you

409
00:49:32,869 --> 00:49:35,337
- Please

410
00:50:25,989 --> 00:50:27,320
Is Parmisano here?

411
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:29,420
I can't say, there are
so many people

412
00:50:34,398 --> 00:50:35,695
- Would you like to order?

413
00:50:37,567 --> 00:50:40,035
But I didn't eat,
I thought we would eat here

414
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:44,329
Well, I ate already,
order a small dish for yourself

415
00:50:44,674 --> 00:50:46,801
Soup, appetizers, turkey steak,

416
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:48,702
oysters, pheasant, partridge?

417
00:50:49,146 --> 00:50:51,376
Well... actually...
something a bit lighter?

418
00:50:52,416 --> 00:50:53,747
- Lobster?
- That's it

419
00:50:54,117 --> 00:50:56,312
- But the lobster..
- Lobster... and wine?

420
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:59,045
- That one over there
- Champagne

421
00:50:59,489 --> 00:51:01,286
- And you sir?
- Rhubarb cordial

422
00:51:01,691 --> 00:51:03,158
Straight

423
00:51:15,272 --> 00:51:17,001
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen

424
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:23,846
My friends and I are actors,
this is the truth

425
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:27,244
We've traveled all over, we were
even in Belgium, England

426
00:51:27,451 --> 00:51:31,182
We traveled all over, doing what
we'll do here tonight

427
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:34,822
So if you like us, do this
with your hands

428
00:51:35,025 --> 00:51:36,788
I mean applaud,
give us some compliments

429
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:58,107
It tastes just like soda

430
00:51:59,149 --> 00:52:02,277
Waiter, bring me some beer
without the foam

431
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:05,584
- Fine
- So, is this Parmisano here yet?

432
00:52:05,822 --> 00:52:07,084
One moment

433
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,451
Ladies and gentlemen, good evening

434
00:52:13,196 --> 00:52:16,597
I present Cocoledo,
the biggest world attraction

435
00:52:17,334 --> 00:52:19,859
Cocoledo will say
good evening to Caballeros

436
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:32,509
Cocoledo will say a poem of the great
Carducci

437
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:41,848
- I love you more... Mum...
- Are you making fun?

438
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:43,348
A penguin

439
00:52:44,027 --> 00:52:46,222
- A penguin?
- Where?

440
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:54,663
Cocoledo, it's not a penguin,
it's a nice gentleman

441
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:01,477
- Do you like the penguin?

442
00:53:01,711 --> 00:53:04,976
- Who do you like then?
- The female penguin

443
00:53:05,215 --> 00:53:06,648
- The female penguin?
- Yes

444
00:53:24,501 --> 00:53:25,195
The devil

445
00:53:30,473 --> 00:53:31,940
- Shall we dance?

446
00:53:37,147 --> 00:53:39,377
You said you knew many people,
but instead...

447
00:53:39,649 --> 00:53:40,673
They'll be here later

448
00:53:43,153 --> 00:53:44,848
Down

449
00:54:33,236 --> 00:54:35,033
See, what did I tell you?
One moment

450
00:54:41,077 --> 00:54:41,805
Sir, please

451
00:54:43,179 --> 00:54:44,806
Sir, one moment please

452
00:55:02,499 --> 00:55:04,660
Enough, you two.
Come, Patrizia, let's dance

453
00:55:23,853 --> 00:55:27,380
Yes, yes, we met already last
September in Stresa

454
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:29,356
- Maybe
- Are you an actress?

455
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:32,689
- Well, I...
- I've seen you somewhere before

456
00:55:32,896 --> 00:55:34,591
But I can't recall

457
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:36,397
I always have my head in the clouds

458
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:40,162
May I? Adelmo Conti

459
00:55:42,072 --> 00:55:44,905
- Are you a movie actress?
- No, variety, dance

460
00:55:45,275 --> 00:55:48,540
Like our great Wanda
I probably saw you there

461
00:55:48,878 --> 00:55:53,747
- No, I've actually begun now.
- Scotch, I've already had three

462
00:55:54,217 --> 00:55:56,515
However, I won a 70 hour
competition

463
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:58,821
Then they crowned me Beach Queen

464
00:55:59,656 --> 00:56:01,521
You're beginning now, poor girl

465
00:56:02,158 --> 00:56:05,252
You'll need help...
I am Parmisano's partner

466
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:09,161
- What are you doing here?

467
00:56:10,266 --> 00:56:15,329
Do you know Liliana Antonelli?
You know that we... dear Adelmo

468
00:56:15,939 --> 00:56:18,908
It's so nice to see you,
it means that you're not in jail

469
00:56:19,976 --> 00:56:22,774
Nice guy, always joking

470
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:25,511
Adelmo, let's get out of here,
it's too hot

471
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:28,809
- Yes, we're molding here. Coming?
- With pleasure

472
00:56:29,252 --> 00:56:33,211
- Have you met Dal Monte the comedian?
- The penguin? - The penguin

473
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:37,051
Maria, Luigino, Nadeli, Patrizia:
my friends

474
00:56:37,961 --> 00:56:41,488
Liliana won a 70-hour
beauty contest on the beach

475
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:47,097
What a piece of a girl
Checco found. Come on

476
00:56:47,637 --> 00:56:49,764
She's not only pretty,
she can dance, sing

477
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:54,270
I'm giving her a part and I wanted
to talk to Parmisano. Could you?

478
00:56:55,011 --> 00:56:57,912
Sure. I'll do even more
for Liliana. Let's go

479
00:56:59,983 --> 00:57:01,041
The cheque sir, please

480
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,976
One moment, I'm not running away,
am I?

481
00:57:14,497 --> 00:57:15,930
1,000, 250

482
00:57:16,399 --> 00:57:17,832
- 200 lira, sir?
- Keep it...

483
00:57:18,201 --> 00:57:20,362
- No, 200 are missing.
- Look for them

484
00:57:37,754 --> 00:57:39,619
So, is there room for me?

485
00:57:39,823 --> 00:57:41,620
No, we're too many already

486
00:58:03,012 --> 00:58:07,676
Excuse me, have you seen the girl
with two guys in a big car?

487
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,381
He came here, then he went left,
he went that way

488
00:58:12,689 --> 00:58:14,452
- Where did he go?
- I don't know

489
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:17,722
- Thank you
- You're welcome, good evening

490
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:31,974
- Great artist

491
00:58:32,208 --> 00:58:34,005
What are you doing wearing this
suit? Working in cabaret?

492
00:58:34,377 --> 00:58:35,935
There's a party,
they're waiting for me

493
00:58:38,381 --> 00:58:41,407
Can I borrow 50 Lira
in small coins?

494
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:43,675
I have to take a cab

495
00:58:44,053 --> 00:58:46,647
What are you doing?
A 48-year- old man

496
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:49,787
- 42- - 45- - Fine

497
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,225
- Did you hear the gossip?
- What?

498
00:58:52,795 --> 00:58:55,855
- About what a fool Checco is
- Who says so? - Everybody. Mostly me

499
00:58:56,065 --> 00:58:59,466
- Jealousy
- Wasn't Melina good enough for you?

500
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:03,194
- This is my business
- She was honest, caring

501
00:59:03,573 --> 00:59:06,804
She loved you, washed for you,
cooked, had savings

502
00:59:07,577 --> 00:59:11,377
All you needed was Liliana Antonelli.
She uses you

503
00:59:11,581 --> 00:59:12,570
Uses me? Come on

504
00:59:13,182 --> 00:59:17,243
Listen to those who care
about you, she's cheating on you

505
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:18,544
- What did you say?
- She's cheating on you

506
00:59:18,755 --> 00:59:21,246
- Repeat it
- Cheating -You're wicked

507
00:59:21,591 --> 00:59:23,582
You don't understand,
she's a woman of class

508
00:59:23,793 --> 00:59:26,626
She loves me. She should be
respected. And you'll see

509
00:59:26,863 --> 00:59:31,698
You'll all see our success.
All over Italy

510
00:59:33,803 --> 00:59:35,270
Go away, poor man

511
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:19,312
Mr. Checco, we looked all over
for you

512
01:00:20,383 --> 01:00:24,979
Your friend is nice, we had so much
fun I don't know how to thank you

513
01:00:26,389 --> 01:00:28,380
- He'll wait outside for us tomorrow
- Open up

514
01:00:35,531 --> 01:00:37,396
Will you call me? Good night

515
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:46,566
Come on

516
01:00:47,677 --> 01:00:51,306
What are you doing? Mrs. Rosetta
is sleeping now

517
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:53,406
Good

518
01:01:01,958 --> 01:01:04,188
My child, what did you have in mind?

519
01:01:05,728 --> 01:01:08,026
I've always respected you,
do you think I'm a fool?

520
01:01:09,432 --> 01:01:13,425
Look there, count them,
They are 32 women

521
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:17,666
Each one prettier than the next
and they all loved and respected me

522
01:01:17,874 --> 01:01:20,604
they made a great fuss over me,
and you... Give me that

523
01:01:22,278 --> 01:01:24,473
I understand you,
you're calculating

524
01:01:24,814 --> 01:01:26,941
you're nothing but
a cold calculating person

525
01:01:27,617 --> 01:01:30,780
So I'll make my calculations.
I did some things for you

526
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:34,551
Because I like you,
I really do

527
01:01:35,224 --> 01:01:36,384
So let's go then

528
01:01:38,661 --> 01:01:39,355
Sure

529
01:01:51,941 --> 01:01:52,930
But you...

530
01:01:54,243 --> 01:01:55,073
So it's...

531
01:02:04,854 --> 01:02:06,185
Did you understand what I said?

532
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:08,584
- Damn it

533
01:02:21,504 --> 01:02:24,405
Wait, don't go like this,
come up for a moment

534
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:29,609
Better?

535
01:02:31,614 --> 01:02:34,242
If you need to hit me to release it,
go ahead then

536
01:02:36,018 --> 01:02:38,316
You don't wear a beret
with this suit

537
01:02:39,689 --> 01:02:42,021
You actually shouldn't have worn
it in the first place

538
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:44,688
You're a nice guy, you know?

539
01:02:45,461 --> 01:02:48,794
So did you conquest all
32 girls with this beret?

540
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:51,597
Don't get mad, I'm joking

541
01:02:52,969 --> 01:02:54,402
I'm doing it
because I care for you

542
01:02:55,905 --> 01:02:57,372
It's my way, understand?

543
01:02:58,074 --> 01:03:00,542
You don't have to be jealous
of those who want to help me

544
01:03:01,544 --> 01:03:03,569
You and I have a long way ahead

545
01:03:04,714 --> 01:03:07,979
I know you were unlucky and that
you're talented, very talented

546
01:03:09,352 --> 01:03:13,049
Think of it, Mr. Checco,
what a success

547
01:03:13,756 --> 01:03:15,690
- Where?
- Everywhere

548
01:03:16,325 --> 01:03:17,758
We'll have shows
in all the theaters,

549
01:03:19,228 --> 01:03:21,856
with big signs, colored...

550
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:26,026
...with my name this high,
and yours too, shiny,

551
01:03:26,502 --> 01:03:28,800
on top of the theater roof,
flicking on and off

552
01:03:30,106 --> 01:03:32,836
And the theater is packed...

553
01:03:34,277 --> 01:03:38,236
And I walk down the stairs,
all covered with feathers

554
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:44,450
Look, Mr. Checco, I've got goose bumps

555
01:03:45,388 --> 01:03:50,621
"Raining, raining over the thirsty
dead trees, over the myrtle"

556
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:57,399
I'm an artist. So are you,
you've got spunk, spunk

557
01:03:57,667 --> 01:04:01,398
You'll see, you and I together,
always. I will be the performer

558
01:04:01,604 --> 01:04:04,232
I don't need anyone, I will form
the company, I promise you

559
01:04:10,046 --> 01:04:10,375
May I?

560
01:04:12,648 --> 01:04:13,012
Good night

561
01:04:26,162 --> 01:04:28,153
I'm going to rest a little bit

562
01:04:29,098 --> 01:04:31,430
Yes, this is it, Liliana

563
01:04:32,568 --> 01:04:33,159
I can feel it

564
01:05:16,646 --> 01:05:17,738
Good morning...

565
01:05:23,552 --> 01:05:27,921
I work with this. I wear a costume
my friend. With this,

566
01:05:28,491 --> 01:05:31,585
we'll debut in Rome,
then Naples, then Salerno...

567
01:05:32,094 --> 01:05:35,461
...to Pescara and maybe
Sicily too. A great turn, right?

568
01:05:35,698 --> 01:05:39,828
And the script... all
French spirit, American stuff

569
01:05:40,169 --> 01:05:43,434
- Who wrote it?
- It's mine. It's all in my head

570
01:05:43,906 --> 01:05:45,430
The title is "Stars and Sparks"

571
01:05:46,008 --> 01:05:48,476
There's a fantastic part.
Better than Beckett

572
01:05:48,711 --> 01:05:50,838
Sure, but let's talk money now

573
01:05:51,647 --> 01:05:54,616
Absolute news: no more salaries

574
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:57,943
Nothing, we'll be one society,
a family

575
01:05:58,454 --> 01:06:00,581
- Good-bye - Where are you going?
- I'm leaving

576
01:06:01,257 --> 01:06:03,225
- Who'll be the boss?
- I will

577
01:06:04,994 --> 01:06:07,485
What... well?

578
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:09,429
Waiter, how much is it?

579
01:06:11,334 --> 01:06:12,801
I will pay for the coffee
and I won't speak to you again

580
01:06:13,336 --> 01:06:15,634
You want to form the company and
make a dancer out of this cod?

581
01:06:16,105 --> 01:06:18,369
You know what I say?
Form the company with her

582
01:06:18,574 --> 01:06:20,132
and don't mess with people
who work

583
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:24,773
- Who's the codfish?
- You know very well

584
01:06:25,781 --> 01:06:26,805
The boss

585
01:06:29,618 --> 01:06:32,644
You're a vulgar piece,
but the end for you, my dear

586
01:06:32,855 --> 01:06:34,447
As an actress you're dead

587
01:06:34,724 --> 01:06:36,521
Even worse, you never started

588
01:06:37,259 --> 01:06:41,662
40 years in business,
50 that they sneer at him

589
01:06:42,365 --> 01:06:46,426
Huckster, wretch, beggar

590
01:06:47,069 --> 01:06:50,766
Leave me, someone has to tell
him the truth

591
01:06:50,973 --> 01:06:54,238
Have you seen him on stage?
"I bought a goose..."

592
01:06:54,610 --> 01:06:57,340
You're nothing but a cheap courtesan

593
01:06:59,715 --> 01:07:01,205
I will show you who
Valeria del Sole is

594
01:07:11,127 --> 01:07:13,220
Pretends to be the boss

595
01:07:13,562 --> 01:07:14,790
Melina, what happened?

596
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:22,398
- I'm an artist and I don't want
to compromise -What do you care?

597
01:07:22,605 --> 01:07:23,663
What did they do to you?

598
01:07:24,006 --> 01:07:25,803
Nothing, we just spoke

599
01:07:26,942 --> 01:07:28,773
- Do you like it?
- Nice

600
01:07:28,978 --> 01:07:32,209
It was very cheap, I only paid 5,000
now, the rest next week

601
01:07:32,782 --> 01:07:34,750
I had 3,000 left

602
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:39,511
Here, it's yours, for you

603
01:07:41,257 --> 01:07:42,884
No, let me do that

604
01:07:45,161 --> 01:07:47,425
Look at them.! Unbelievable

605
01:07:47,997 --> 01:07:48,895
It looks beautiful

606
01:07:50,032 --> 01:07:50,930
Very good

607
01:07:52,401 --> 01:07:54,460
- And the company?
- We'll do it

608
01:07:55,438 --> 01:07:57,372
We'll do it. We have to

609
01:07:59,141 --> 01:08:02,372
I want to see where he's sleeping,
the owner locked his room

610
01:08:14,323 --> 01:08:15,187
Mr. Edmondo!

611
01:08:27,703 --> 01:08:28,795
Stop it!

612
01:09:03,072 --> 01:09:06,064
Mr. Edmondo is sleeping, my dear,
sleeping. Understood?

613
01:09:06,442 --> 01:09:08,740
You don't pay, so you don't
come into my house ever again

614
01:09:09,745 --> 01:09:13,010
I'll report you for holding
my belongings

615
01:09:13,315 --> 01:09:16,148
It's no doubt against the law
and against the constitution

616
01:09:16,418 --> 01:09:18,613
You'll receive a registered letter
in the morning

617
01:09:19,321 --> 01:09:21,346
- Enough
- Go kill yourself

618
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:30,132
Edmondo, mean man

619
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:32,959
What a district, what characters

620
01:09:34,436 --> 01:09:35,425
Rascal

621
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:50,819
What are you laughing at?

622
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:56,658
- Beautiful
- Here. Bad times for artists

623
01:09:57,359 --> 01:10:00,089
- You, an artist?
- Checco Dal Monte: Company boss

624
01:10:00,329 --> 01:10:02,229
Come to my place with me

625
01:10:02,965 --> 01:10:05,092
- Where do you live?
- Rome is my home

626
01:10:05,434 --> 01:10:07,231
All the squares,
all the streets are mine

627
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:10,903
I'm homeless just like you

628
01:10:19,815 --> 01:10:24,912
Granada, my love
Sadness...

629
01:10:26,589 --> 01:10:29,615
- Wilma!
- Hi!

630
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:36,524
I'm staying with your sorrow
and I don't care about life

631
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:39,367
This one's a great Brazilian artist:
Wilma

632
01:10:43,205 --> 01:10:47,471
I like to meet at night with people
free like you, mad like me

633
01:10:48,644 --> 01:10:49,804
In America, I was
a chemical engineer

634
01:10:52,448 --> 01:10:54,882
But I like music,
so I came to Italy

635
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:57,382
This is my place,
I feel free here

636
01:10:57,686 --> 01:11:00,621
I can come here, go there,
with no money,

637
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:03,589
like a swallow

638
01:11:04,793 --> 01:11:07,353
- You play...
- A very typical song

639
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:08,187
Let's hear it

640
01:11:09,798 --> 01:11:14,963
My lemon, my lemon tree,
I ask for a jacarand tree

641
01:11:17,573 --> 01:11:18,164
Bravi...

642
01:11:20,442 --> 01:11:22,569
We'll listen to the song
for a while

643
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:24,837
- ...but lower your voice
- Thank you

644
01:11:27,049 --> 01:11:31,782
My lemon, my lemon tree
I ask for a jacarand tree

645
01:11:32,321 --> 01:11:37,452
One time with a tindo le-le
Other time with a tindo

646
01:11:48,671 --> 01:11:54,632
Tindo le-le, a promise
An adventure starts

647
01:11:54,910 --> 01:11:58,744
With a smile of love

648
01:12:02,651 --> 01:12:09,750
The day is breaking
The day is beginning

649
01:12:21,103 --> 01:12:22,263
Enough, tramps

650
01:12:23,672 --> 01:12:27,665
Tramps? We create art here

651
01:12:27,910 --> 01:12:28,877
Sure, art

652
01:12:29,378 --> 01:12:31,346
- Very good
- Play more quietly

653
01:12:31,714 --> 01:12:34,308
You two are mine, don't deal
with anyone else, I'll book you

654
01:12:36,452 --> 01:12:39,046
I know many great artists,
all poor

655
01:12:39,855 --> 01:12:43,120
Hungarian choreographer,
a great Russian musician

656
01:12:43,959 --> 01:12:49,124
A cowboy who shoots a tiny fly
from a distance

657
01:12:49,665 --> 01:12:51,895
- Where is that man?
- He's at the hotel for the poor

658
01:12:52,334 --> 01:12:54,700
The hotel for the poor?

659
01:12:54,937 --> 01:12:58,134
Always the same, the best
are always poor. Let's go

660
01:12:58,674 --> 01:13:02,303
Enough with the usual professionals,
conceited, pretentious

661
01:13:02,611 --> 01:13:06,570
This is the time for unknowns.
You'll be the stars of my new show

662
01:13:07,116 --> 01:13:08,811
You are invited to the premier

663
01:13:09,952 --> 01:13:10,816
Come,John

664
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:13,285
Good night partner, good night...

665
01:13:46,155 --> 01:13:46,780
Great

666
01:13:49,625 --> 01:13:51,593
- What do you want?
- A friend

667
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:53,788
A friend...

668
01:14:00,302 --> 01:14:01,428
Wake up, it's morning

669
01:14:11,814 --> 01:14:14,146
You want to perform?
There's a great manager

670
01:14:15,017 --> 01:14:17,485
You are a lucky guy,
show me what you know

671
01:14:22,558 --> 01:14:23,354
Well done

672
01:14:26,562 --> 01:14:28,393
I told you she's sleeping

673
01:14:37,873 --> 01:14:39,067
Who is it?

674
01:15:01,363 --> 01:15:04,457
Good morning, sleep well?
I came early because...

675
01:15:07,669 --> 01:15:08,931
I'm disturbing you?

676
01:15:09,872 --> 01:15:14,104
I'm sorry but I met some wonderful
people last night

677
01:15:14,610 --> 01:15:17,875
I'm tired, can't you understand?
Let me sleep please

678
01:15:22,651 --> 01:15:26,951
- Who are they?
- Those are the artists

679
01:15:27,756 --> 01:15:31,749
This is John, he plays trumpet,
listen to this. Come, play

680
01:15:37,799 --> 01:15:39,824
And this is Billy,
a pistol shooter

681
01:15:42,037 --> 01:15:45,529
Nothing but international figures,
it's a hit, the company is formed!

682
01:15:46,174 --> 01:15:48,074
It's done, Liliana, it's done

683
01:15:48,777 --> 01:15:49,402
Have you finished?

684
01:15:52,514 --> 01:15:54,505
What is it?

685
01:15:54,883 --> 01:15:56,475
Do me a favor and leave me alone

686
01:15:57,619 --> 01:16:01,020
Talk to the landlord because
the room here is quite expensive

687
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:04,855
I can't go on like this,
she won't give you the keys

688
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:07,626
The toilet is always broken
and I want to move to a hotel

689
01:16:07,996 --> 01:16:10,089
- You want to move to the hotel?
- Yes, why?

690
01:16:10,365 --> 01:16:13,391
I think I've waited too long,
I was at your disposal

691
01:16:13,702 --> 01:16:17,433
I've done everything to help you,
even rejected a proposal,

692
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:19,840
and I'm still at the same point
without a penny

693
01:16:20,542 --> 01:16:21,804
A proposal? From whom?

694
01:16:22,344 --> 01:16:23,868
Leave it, you'll break it

695
01:16:26,481 --> 01:16:28,312
Please, take those guys away

696
01:16:31,186 --> 01:16:32,744
- Liliana, what's wrong?
- Can't you see?

697
01:16:33,522 --> 01:16:37,049
You should let me sleep, I came
back at 5 a.m, I'm tired

698
01:16:38,226 --> 01:16:41,627
You want to form a company
but you'll need money, a lot

699
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:46,497
I'll find the money, Liliana

700
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:01,810
Napoleon

701
01:17:15,831 --> 01:17:17,298
Giuseppe Verdi

702
01:17:39,988 --> 01:17:40,920
Garibaldi

703
01:18:15,123 --> 01:18:15,953
Voila

704
01:18:33,308 --> 01:18:34,900
Girls, on stage

705
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:45,279
See what a darling?
He's here for money

706
01:18:45,687 --> 01:18:49,350
- Don't make a fool of yourself
- Watch it, I don't want to see him

707
01:18:49,891 --> 01:18:50,823
Let me handle it

708
01:18:52,961 --> 01:18:55,452
I'm forming a company

709
01:18:55,664 --> 01:18:58,599
Dear partner! Great show, great

710
01:18:59,101 --> 01:19:00,693
How are you, friend?

711
01:19:01,269 --> 01:19:03,760
- And Melina? The dressing room?
- That one

712
01:19:07,976 --> 01:19:09,204
May I...

713
01:19:12,380 --> 01:19:14,245
- Come on
- I have to talk to you

714
01:19:17,853 --> 01:19:19,718
Speak, speak loudly so everybody
will hear you

715
01:19:20,255 --> 01:19:23,850
I have to talk to Melina,
it's business, I'm forming a company

716
01:19:24,926 --> 01:19:28,225
And Melina has to pay, right?
Aren't you disgusted?

717
01:19:29,297 --> 01:19:30,355
Go away

718
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:35,664
There's a misunderstanding, it's
a deal, a capital investment

719
01:19:35,871 --> 01:19:37,896
Go away, get the money
from that woman

720
01:19:52,554 --> 01:19:55,352
Melina, I'll be at the pizzeria
with your father

721
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:56,815
I'm coming

722
01:20:43,905 --> 01:20:47,238
That wicked idiot,
what did she do to you?

723
01:20:48,109 --> 01:20:50,407
Wasn't it better with me?

724
01:20:50,979 --> 01:20:52,503
So why did you leave me?

725
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:56,479
I couldn't...

726
01:21:00,222 --> 01:21:04,124
I don't know, I don't know,
she bewitched me

727
01:21:04,893 --> 01:21:07,418
Idiot. And why should I give you
my money?

728
01:21:08,129 --> 01:21:09,858
No, no, don't give it to me

729
01:21:10,465 --> 01:21:13,593
Don't. I don't deserve it,
I don't deserve anything

730
01:21:14,536 --> 01:21:15,696
I'm a dead man anyway

731
01:21:17,172 --> 01:21:19,902
It was my last chance
and you know it, Melina

732
01:21:20,976 --> 01:21:25,345
Because the theater means life to
me, I was born and will die here

733
01:21:25,847 --> 01:21:29,681
This company had to be mine.
Everybody was against me

734
01:21:30,418 --> 01:21:31,646
Envy, jealousy

735
01:21:33,154 --> 01:21:36,988
In thirty years on stage, it had to
be the decisive solution of my life

736
01:21:37,292 --> 01:21:41,285
Melina, I have everything, you know:
all the scenes,

737
01:21:41,529 --> 01:21:44,521
and the black guy, and Buffalo Bill,
and the script,

738
01:21:45,867 --> 01:21:49,462
and I have to furl the flag because
I'm a poor bastard with no money

739
01:21:50,105 --> 01:21:51,800
I just need a small amount

740
01:21:55,844 --> 01:21:59,780
Take it, but go away and don't
show up ever again

741
01:22:00,081 --> 01:22:03,016
You are great, Melina

742
01:22:03,685 --> 01:22:05,778
I'll give it back to you,
with the interest

743
01:22:06,488 --> 01:22:08,786
My first profit will be yours,
only yours,

744
01:22:09,357 --> 01:22:11,348
because you'll take a part
of my company, won't you, Melina?

745
01:22:13,295 --> 01:22:15,160
Melina, look at this

746
01:22:16,831 --> 01:22:18,594
Bill, the daisy

747
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:28,441
1, 2, 3, 4, stop,
it's horrible, no good

748
01:22:28,710 --> 01:22:30,473
There's no rhythm,
this thing here is nothing

749
01:22:31,446 --> 01:22:33,539
Please join in too! Again

750
01:22:33,915 --> 01:22:36,349
1, 2, 3, 4...

751
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:39,586
Gentlemen

752
01:22:42,157 --> 01:22:44,489
I present Liliana Lilli,
the star of the company

753
01:22:45,026 --> 01:22:48,086
Liliana, here is your company:
Valeria, a magnificent soloist

754
01:22:48,596 --> 01:22:50,894
Boema, a Brazilian gypsy

755
01:22:51,566 --> 01:22:54,262
The famous maestro Dubrioski,
a celebrity

756
01:22:54,936 --> 01:22:56,870
Mucci, the Hungarian.
The choreographer

757
01:22:58,006 --> 01:22:59,200
Girls, the dance

758
01:22:59,975 --> 01:23:04,036
Maria, Lucia, Rudi,
Dedi and Tanio

759
01:23:04,779 --> 01:23:07,407
Our Tanio, the golden idol,
you'll see

760
01:23:08,350 --> 01:23:10,944
- What is this stuff?
- The company's poster

761
01:23:11,753 --> 01:23:16,053
I've ordered some bigger, nicer ones

762
01:23:16,992 --> 01:23:18,892
Don't you think my name
should come first?

763
01:23:20,362 --> 01:23:20,828
Yes

764
01:23:22,163 --> 01:23:23,130
It should

765
01:23:24,399 --> 01:23:27,994
Now let's start the rehearsal
with "A Night in Paris"

766
01:23:45,553 --> 01:23:46,383
In line, in line

767
01:24:14,516 --> 01:24:15,676
Calm down...

768
01:24:53,788 --> 01:24:55,187
Stupid morons. 1...

769
01:24:56,424 --> 01:24:58,187
2... Stop. What is this?

770
01:24:58,827 --> 01:25:03,423
Can't you raise a leg?
Like the rest of Italy

771
01:25:03,631 --> 01:25:09,695
You know nothing about
art here

772
01:25:10,071 --> 01:25:12,266
Again, please, 1...

773
01:25:55,450 --> 01:25:57,213
He's a great Russian musician

774
01:26:19,507 --> 01:26:21,031
What do you want from me?

775
01:26:21,776 --> 01:26:23,801
I play what I feel
like playing, got it?

776
01:26:23,978 --> 01:26:26,276
- What does he want from me?
- Calm down...

777
01:26:26,447 --> 01:26:29,143
My contract says I can play
whatever I want, right?

778
01:26:29,350 --> 01:26:31,978
- Otherwise I'll drop everything
- Try again

779
01:26:52,941 --> 01:26:57,776
I am the choreographer,
I always did what I wanted to

780
01:26:59,447 --> 01:27:03,474
Dear sir, Dal Monte,
it's a pleasure

781
01:27:06,588 --> 01:27:09,386
I'm pleased to present you Torello,
the producer of the Excelsior

782
01:27:09,591 --> 01:27:12,992
He gives us the honor
of seeing a rehearsal

783
01:27:13,695 --> 01:27:16,994
Lilly is missing, she's the star,
my discovery

784
01:27:17,432 --> 01:27:20,663
I called... try again

785
01:27:21,669 --> 01:27:24,502
- She left 2 hours ago
- She'll get fined

786
01:27:24,772 --> 01:27:28,435
Shall we start?

787
01:27:28,876 --> 01:27:32,505
This way, please, come girls,
we're starting

788
01:27:34,916 --> 01:27:36,679
The Hungarian is really something

789
01:27:37,418 --> 01:27:39,443
Gentlemen, I'll give you
a brief explanation

790
01:27:40,688 --> 01:27:43,418
This dance has meaning

791
01:27:43,625 --> 01:27:47,721
There is a struggle
between good and evil

792
01:28:10,318 --> 01:28:12,218
- I'll go in alone
- Fine, Liliana, I'll wait here

793
01:28:12,854 --> 01:28:13,786
If you need me, call

794
01:28:17,458 --> 01:28:21,224
What is this tired face?
I passed night by night

795
01:28:21,496 --> 01:28:25,023
I don't feel tired because
I'm inspired by dance

796
01:28:26,134 --> 01:28:28,500
But you have to change
your expression

797
01:28:29,170 --> 01:28:31,638
All the moves are wrong

798
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:35,204
Please, do it again...
go... yes

799
01:28:41,883 --> 01:28:43,350
Liliana, where have you been?

800
01:28:44,052 --> 01:28:46,520
Get dressed, we have the general
rehearsal, the theater man is here

801
01:28:47,021 --> 01:28:49,182
Mr. Checco, I have great news

802
01:28:51,526 --> 01:28:54,962
No, wait, do you remember
our dreams?

803
01:28:55,563 --> 01:29:00,262
Rome, Milan, Paris... I'm really
going to Milan and maybe to Paris,

804
01:29:01,302 --> 01:29:04,703
with Parmisano's company,
I've just signed the contract

805
01:29:05,406 --> 01:29:08,068
And it's all thanks to you,
I could never thank you enough

806
01:29:08,843 --> 01:29:10,572
I'm so happy, Mr. Checco!

807
01:29:16,017 --> 01:29:19,214
Your friend, Mr. Adelmo
is out there

808
01:29:20,688 --> 01:29:23,316
He wants to talk with you
about the fine

809
01:29:24,759 --> 01:29:25,521
Shall I call him?

810
01:29:29,931 --> 01:29:30,829
There won't be a fine

811
01:29:32,367 --> 01:29:34,447
The rehearsal is going well, right?

812
01:29:34,448 --> 01:29:36,527
I'll come here tomorrow
to watch

813
01:29:41,075 --> 01:29:42,064
Don't you have anything
to say to me?

814
01:29:48,483 --> 01:29:49,541
You did the right thing

815
01:29:53,054 --> 01:29:54,043
Follow your destiny

816
01:29:59,927 --> 01:30:01,189
Will you come to my debut?

817
01:30:26,621 --> 01:30:30,182
Damn, I have to make
these improvements

818
01:30:30,525 --> 01:30:34,928
Girls, I can't see
the fire, please

819
01:30:35,396 --> 01:30:40,095
You have to be like a tree

820
01:30:40,334 --> 01:30:43,303
Come over here, please...
Come, right now

821
01:30:43,504 --> 01:30:48,305
This is your position, please.
Come on

822
01:30:48,509 --> 01:30:53,469
- Yes people, please people...
- Checco, what's wrong?

823
01:30:53,681 --> 01:30:57,845
What is this child doing?
Come here, please

824
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:20,429
Be careful, madam

825
01:31:21,976 --> 01:31:23,136
She's coming. Move away

826
01:31:27,181 --> 01:31:28,079
From here

827
01:31:29,717 --> 01:31:31,207
Up...

828
01:31:33,955 --> 01:31:35,013
Hurry up

829
01:31:46,033 --> 01:31:46,829
Start the elevator, go

830
01:31:58,279 --> 01:32:01,612
- Beast
- I wish you'd fall

831
01:32:23,404 --> 01:32:30,833
I fear that I still love you

832
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:38,312
Desperately, you're still
In my heart

833
01:33:31,572 --> 01:33:32,664
- It's this one?
- Yes, it is

834
01:33:35,076 --> 01:33:35,804
Good evening

835
01:33:38,379 --> 01:33:38,868
18,19

836
01:33:40,281 --> 01:33:40,838
How do they go?

837
01:33:47,588 --> 01:33:49,613
- Take the cat
- Thank you, dear

838
01:33:50,157 --> 01:33:51,181
Which newspaper would you like?

839
01:33:51,859 --> 01:33:53,884
Epola, Bis, Bolero and Today

840
01:33:54,362 --> 01:33:54,691
Fine

841
01:33:57,131 --> 01:33:59,326
Departure on 4th platform

842
01:34:00,301 --> 01:34:03,429
Direct to Florence-Bologna-Milan

843
01:34:33,701 --> 01:34:36,169
I'm going to Milan, we debut there

844
01:34:36,671 --> 01:34:39,105
- Very well...
- I had a great success, you know?

845
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:42,307
Me too. I produced a beautiful show

846
01:34:42,810 --> 01:34:44,209
I signed a Viennese ballet company

847
01:34:44,645 --> 01:34:47,478
The premier is tomorrow,
we debut in...

848
01:34:47,815 --> 01:34:48,440
Where?

849
01:34:52,520 --> 01:35:01,121
Express train on track 3
is departing now to Foggia

850
01:35:02,196 --> 01:35:05,063
Hurry. Get on, sir

851
01:35:10,004 --> 01:35:10,868
2 days in Bisceglia

852
01:35:11,806 --> 01:35:12,830
One in Molfetta

853
01:35:13,941 --> 01:35:15,602
- And Trani?
- Trani only gives movies

854
01:35:16,377 --> 01:35:17,969
- Sure?
- Who'll give you that?

855
01:35:18,913 --> 01:35:19,709
Finally

856
01:35:33,461 --> 01:35:35,952
I love you, can't I love you?

857
01:35:36,564 --> 01:35:37,121
Come on

858
01:35:44,839 --> 01:35:46,807
Excuse me, is this seat free?

859
01:35:58,686 --> 01:36:00,517
Do you want some coffee?

860
01:36:01,155 --> 01:36:02,452
I'll get it from the maestro

861
01:36:08,162 --> 01:36:08,560
What?

862
01:36:09,663 --> 01:36:10,925
I didn't say anything

863
01:36:11,565 --> 01:36:13,362
Sorry, I thought you...

864
01:36:14,802 --> 01:36:16,360
Are you an actress?

865
01:36:19,273 --> 01:36:20,934
Strange, you are just the type

866
01:36:22,243 --> 01:36:24,211
I know what I'm talking about.
I am a director

867
01:36:25,079 --> 01:36:25,511
Are you?

868
01:36:26,547 --> 01:36:27,707
I have a variety company

869
01:36:29,216 --> 01:36:29,978
Pretty

870
01:36:31,051 --> 01:36:31,483
Thank you

871
01:36:32,419 --> 01:36:33,147
Very pretty
