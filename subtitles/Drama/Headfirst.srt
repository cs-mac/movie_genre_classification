1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:05,639
HELSINKI-FILMI PRESENTS

2
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:52,474
Are you okay? Ouch...

3
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:55,230
Fuck! I just wrecked my car!

4
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:59,606
I swallowed my tooth. Chewing
gum takes seven years to digest, -

5
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:02,021
so a tooth will take
at least as long.

6
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:05,441
Why were you smiling to yourself?
It's distracting.

7
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:11,413
Can I call your mom or dad?

8
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:22,751
Don't smile. Life will hit you
in the face if you're happy.

9
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,923
Fu...

10
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:35,019
The bell rang. Get inside.

11
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:48,196
Holy crap.

12
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:56,788
Give it to me.
- What?

13
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:02,589
Why should I?

14
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:05,551
The choices you make now -

15
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:08,880
will determine what kind
of person you'll become.

16
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:11,799
Choose weed
and you'll become dorks.

17
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:15,557
Choose booze
and you'll become depressed dorks.

18
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,437
If you choose speed...

19
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:21,191
That choice
won't make you prime ministers.

20
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:24,604
Which is good because
this country will be better off-

21
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,023
if you don't become
prime ministers.

22
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:29,032
Choose booze.

23
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:31,114
Suck your mom's dick.

24
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,491
Good answer.

25
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,626
Nice.

26
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:50,379
A HELPING HAND FOR A CHILD

27
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:55,472
Thank you.

28
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:05,277
13 euros 7O cents.

29
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:14,069
It's for a good cause.

30
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:17,873
HEADFIRST

31
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,190
Where's the kid? - Don't you
want to know what happened?

32
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,066
Where's the kid?

33
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:30,729
<i>Open the fucking door!</i>

34
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:32,864
Shut up!

35
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:38,533
What's that? - A report
to Child Protective Services.

36
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:41,915
No, no, no.
I'll take her to another school.

37
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:45,577
You'll be rid of her.
- No. I'm pressing "Send."

38
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:48,793
No, I'll go to social services,
sort everything out-

39
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,799
and register her at another school.
- No...

40
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,846
Or I'll hang you from the flagpole
by your necklace.

41
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,122
Dad.

42
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:27,957
What? - So you managed
to find your way here again.

43
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,836
Yeah.

44
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,173
We're moving.

45
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,346
Where?
- Away.

46
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:43,302
Will I see you again?
- No.

47
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:52,069
Here. Call them.
They'll give you a job.

48
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:58,325
A junkyard? - You always managed
to turn shit into even more shit.

49
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,946
Use your talent.

50
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:07,455
Maybe you'll also get a couple
of new stories for your collection.

51
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,960
You need money?
- No. I've got 20 euros.

52
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:20,722
Right. Bye.

53
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:37,356
"The rabbit gives the orders;
man obeys. Don't abandon love -

54
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:40,492
so it won't abandon you."

55
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:45,205
Why don't you just screw off,
tea bag.

56
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:52,504
I didn't smoke weed in the toilet.

57
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:58,131
Well, someone did and we need
a scapegoat. - But it wasn't me.

58
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:02,014
Junkie.
- Fuck!

59
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:05,429
A swearing junkie.
- Fucking hell!

60
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:14,355
<i>You're a junkie who swears a lot</i>

61
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:18,439
<i>Just earned one more hour
of detention</i>

62
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:20,900
Hell no!

63
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:36,748
I can sell you speed.

64
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:40,965
Matikainen from 9B was sent to
involuntary treatment last week.

65
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,970
His medication is still here.

66
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:48,602
Who are you?

67
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,447
Can I have a piece of gum?

68
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:05,277
If you do the assignment
on the blackboard.

69
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:09,114
"Tell three things about yourself.
Remember to smile."

70
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,375
Three things
you've never told anyone.

71
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:21,127
One: my mom had me
when she was fifteen. - Good.

72
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,586
Two: I don't know who my dad is -

73
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:26,256
and my mom doesn't know
who her dad is.

74
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:29,267
Mom only knows
what my grandma told her:

75
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:32,646
her dad had an ugly tattoo
on his left shoulder -

76
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:36,809
and he got my grandma pregnant
in the backseat of a Nissan.

77
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:43,444
Three: Some day
I'm gonna get on a train -

78
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:47,486
and get out of this place.
After years I'll bump into you, -

79
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:51,282
and you'll see in me
what you never had the guts to be.

80
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:58,247
How many times have
you switched schools? - Six.

81
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:00,874
I don't have to earn your gum.

82
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,169
I stole it
when you weren't looking.

83
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:08,136
And your name is?
- Takku Kurhinen.

84
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,511
Clean the blackboard.

85
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:31,117
Tell me your story.
- No.

86
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:35,163
C'mon. I'll give you
a ten-euro incentive bonus.

87
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,331
That's a fiver.

88
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:42,128
Whatever.
Everyone has the same story.

89
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:45,176
Everyone says they had bad luck.

90
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,092
I'm sure the bad luck
ends at some point.

91
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:51,554
Have you heard of
Tsutomu Yamaguchi?

92
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:55,349
No.
- He was a traveling salesman.

93
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:59,520
He was in Hiroshima when
the atomic bomb exploded in 1945.

94
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,726
But he survived.

95
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:08,117
In a week he returned home.
- His bad luck ended?

96
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,945
He lived in Nagasaki.

97
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:19,119
Think about that.

98
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,506
Listen.
- What?

99
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:30,172
Don't tell anyone
what you just told me.

100
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:35,477
Because teenagers are cruel?
- No, because people are cruel.

101
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:39,227
Your last name is Kurhinen.
- Yup.

102
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:42,017
Your mom's name is Essi.
- Yeah.

103
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,568
The board is clean.

104
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,532
No, it's not.

105
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:57,407
I can't hear you anymore.
I ripped my eardrums out.

106
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:03,963
What the hell?

107
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,465
Fuck no! No! No.

108
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:25,895
Oh, look.
It's the Nuclear Bomb Man.

109
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:33,698
What's the story of this car?
- Isn't this a junkyard?

110
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,537
There are no stories here.
They end here.

111
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:40,663
The backseat in this model is good.
- Oh yeah?

112
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:45,414
Yeah. I once had a woman
who drove a car like this.

113
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:50,503
She was a cleaner. Her hair
always smelled of detergent.

114
00:11:56,633 --> 00:12:00,854
I really... have to... go.

115
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:44,230
ls it really that heavy?
- What the hell is that?

116
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:50,233
It's a mask. I found eight
different kinds in the trash.

117
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,693
Check these out.

118
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:58,908
A bear, elk and an ostrich. Or
whatever this birdie is called...

119
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:03,534
I could go and rob the convenience
store next door eight times.

120
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:08,796
Or nine, if I decided
to use my own face the last time.

121
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,588
Put your work clothes on
and help me.

122
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:17,676
What are you so worked up about?
- I don't know...

123
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:21,722
I might've found something
I've been looking for for years, -

124
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:25,184
but I don't have the guts
to do anything about it.

125
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,568
I understand.

126
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:34,231
You should chill.

127
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:38,827
Nothing is black-and-white,
you know? - No.

128
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,954
Pandas are black-and-white.

129
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:48,336
That sucks. Bye.

130
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:51,957
Who was that?
- My mom.

131
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,508
What did she have to say?

132
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:58,051
All kinds of stuff.
We talk about everything.

133
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,306
Like what?
- About what sucks.

134
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,559
About my dreams. About everything.

135
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:14,901
What's your dream? - I want to
buy my girlfriends chicken fillets.

136
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:18,149
What?
- Chicken fillet bras.

137
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:22,329
It's this rubber stick-on bra
you glue to your tits.

138
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:26,450
They're so hot.
- Go buy them.

139
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:29,244
I'm sure
they're not that expensive.

140
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,211
I've always been so broke -

141
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:38,129
that I never even dared to dream
of chicken fillets for my tits.

142
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,779
What are you doing?

143
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:07,916
I'm trying to Google
if my teacher would grow tits -

144
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:10,202
if I laced his coffee
with estrogen.

145
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:12,837
But this shitty computer
isn't working.

146
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,997
We don't have a computer.

147
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,792
If we did, it would be shitty.
- C'm0n.

148
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:35,602
Monkey.
- Stop.

149
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,813
You're my monkey.
- Stop!

150
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:46,408
Let me go!

151
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,621
You fuckin‘ maniac!

152
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,921
I fixed it.

153
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:41,752
You don't have to hitchhike.
- I wouldn't have hitchhiked.

154
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,758
I either walk or sit behind
the wheel myself.

155
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:48,349
I've had my share of riding
in the backseat of guys' cars.

156
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,385
It felt like a prison.

157
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:53,221
If you're who I think you are,-

158
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:57,392
you have a granddaughter.
Want to see her? - Maybe.

159
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:08,615
Your shoulder...
- What about it?

160
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:12,536
Nothing.

161
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:16,915
How's your mom?

162
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:42,232
You must've been close.

163
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:45,524
Flowers and everything.
- Hell no.

164
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:51,075
She was allergic to carnations.
They made her choke.

165
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:54,115
What about that?
- She hated him.

166
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:58,120
She'd throw a radio at your head
if they played one of his songs.

167
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:15,395
I understand you want to sort
things out with your parents.

168
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:22,269
I managed to sort things out
with my parents.

169
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:26,272
They're dead now.

170
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,734
There's nothing to sort out
after that.

171
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:35,206
If you need anything, call me.

172
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,665
Okay, girls,
go run with the others.

173
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:21,036
I'm a boy. - Running is
for other people. I don't run.

174
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:25,378
Get up now. Run one lap
and you'll get a reward.

175
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,299
Running is for other people.

176
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,504
For sitting, you get
a urinary tract infection.

177
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,846
Are you doing homework?!

178
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:42,018
Nerd. What a nerd.

179
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,268
By the way, the right answer is 7.

180
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:50,990
Don't write "7" or the bridge
in the exercise will collapse.

181
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:53,025
I can't run either.

182
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:25,274
Running is for other people, huh?
- Where's my reward?

183
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:28,357
It'll be on your report card.
You'll get a B.

184
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:30,988
Are you serious?

185
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:35,492
A freakin‘ grade! What the fuck
do I need a grade for?

186
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:38,951
I gotta go. Someone's trying
to take over my market.

187
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:46,834
Hi.

188
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:52,376
You want weed?

189
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:55,638
How much?
- Make me an offer.

190
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:59,016
Let's talk.

191
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,225
Nice talking to you.

192
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,389
Douchebag!

193
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:15,408
You're an asshole!

194
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:20,200
Taneli! Taneli!

195
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:54,030
They said I can let you out if
you've calmed down. - I haven't.

196
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,482
I don't care.

197
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,763
Long time no see.

198
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:23,764
You still look like a dick
with an angelic face.

199
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:25,928
I missed our conversations.

200
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:29,060
We had the best ones
when you didn't say anything.

201
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:33,148
You liked my presence? - I liked
it when you kept your mouth shut.

202
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:42,028
Wait.

203
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:45,869
I'll take care of this.

204
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:48,417
What's up, kiddo?

205
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:55,796
C‘mon. Let's talk like two adults.

206
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:10,974
Shut up, both of you!

207
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,726
Get your ass in the car.

208
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:23,028
They replanted my tooth.
I just hope it was mine.

209
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:26,117
Matikainen from 9B
hit himself with a shovel -

210
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,625
and knocked his teeth out
in the same spot. - Why?

211
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,751
Because he's Matikainen from 9B.

212
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,544
But your daughter Tiina...
- My name is Takku.

213
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:37,546
Takku might benefit -

214
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:41,091
from being in special education.
- Special education?

215
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:44,507
Code word
for taking her into custody.

216
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:48,094
You don't have to be afraid
of that. - You wouldn't do that?

217
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,514
No. Takku needs someone to keep
an eye on her at school.

218
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,478
Get her someone.

219
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:57,521
There's no funding for that.
Only for custody cases.

220
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:01,612
If you don't find anyone
by Monday morning, -

221
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:04,618
the principal will put her
in special education.

222
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:10,412
I was wrong.

223
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:14,375
You don't have an angelic face.
You're just a dick.

224
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:26,683
Stop. In life they'll take
your ass from you -

225
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,263
if it isn't attached to your body.

226
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:32,976
Even if you haven't done anything,
you'll lose everything.

227
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,890
Don't give them a reason.

228
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:38,482
The world will slap you
in the face even without a reason.

229
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:54,831
It's okay.
I still got ten euros for gas.

230
00:25:17,141 --> 00:25:18,768
You got twenty euros?

231
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:21,479
For what?
- For gas.

232
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:24,364
I had ten euros but I lost it.

233
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:36,035
What took you so long?

234
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:40,081
The religion teacher's jacket
was the only one that had a wallet.

235
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:50,799
I want this back.

236
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:53,185
I don't steal anymore.
- I do.

237
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:56,389
With this salary, I can't afford...
- Clock radios?

238
00:25:56,597 --> 00:25:58,395
New teeth.
- Right.

239
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:01,022
One thing.
- Yeah?

240
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:05,193
I wonder how it would've been
between us -

241
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:07,153
if you hadn't disappeared.

242
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:15,492
Like that. How did it feel?

243
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:18,957
I think I c0uld've
learned to like it.

244
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:36,763
I need a favor.

245
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:42,526
Go away. This won't end well.

246
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:46,314
My daughter needs someone
to keep an eye on her at school.

247
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:48,816
You're her grandpa.

248
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:55,326
I got kicked out.

249
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,705
There's beer in my refrigerator.

250
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:01,833
Go get it and
then I'll consider it. - Okay.

251
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:05,333
You got the keys?
- I don't.

252
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:08,131
The balcony door is open.

253
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:30,486
What the hell?
- Where's the refrigerator?

254
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:45,123
See ya.
- See ya.

255
00:27:50,878 --> 00:27:53,176
Thanks a bunch.

256
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:58,094
What was the point of all this?
- To teach a lesson.

257
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,392
Go away. Don't call.
I do shitty things to people.

258
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:06,899
Help me. - No.
It's not possible to help people.

259
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:12,533
What the hell?

260
00:28:12,983 --> 00:28:15,406
Non-alcoholic beer.

261
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:18,747
What kind of assholes drink
non-alcoholic beer?

262
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:22,250
Holy shit!

263
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:03,727
<i>Hello?
- It's Essi.</i>

264
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:07,397
<i>Wh0?-</i> It doesn't matter.
I dialed your number randomly.

265
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:11,902
<i>Huh?-</i> Because I'm fed up with
everything always being my fault.

266
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:15,364
I called to tell you
that this is your fault.

267
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:19,284
<i>What‘</i> /s?- Everything.
Everything is your fault.

268
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,907
<i>But I don't even know you.</i>

269
00:30:22,112 --> 00:30:25,036
Stop trying to avoid
your responsibility!

270
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:03,529
You can finish it.

271
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:30,557
I wonder where the fuck
they think they're flying to?

272
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:32,641
Somewhere pretty.

273
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:45,238
You have to dip the mop in water.
- But then it'll get dirty.

274
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:49,082
Tell me your story.
- I don't have one.

275
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:52,874
Everyone does.
We'll never win a singing contest-

276
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:57,041
or graduate with
a master's degree in economics.

277
00:31:57,207 --> 00:32:02,179
The fact that we work here
at this age means we're failures -

278
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:07,134
and that we have to drink beer
in the middle of a workday.

279
00:32:08,135 --> 00:32:09,978
Oh.

280
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:22,567
You're wrong.
- Explain.

281
00:32:23,233 --> 00:32:26,157
If I do good things,
good things will happen.

282
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:29,623
I feed a rabbit
that lives near my dormitory.

283
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:31,746
I tell him about my dreams.

284
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:36,046
Does he tell you about his?
- Of course not.

285
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:40,050
He's a rabbit. Rabbits
don't talk about their dreams.

286
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:44,008
He just says
I can tell him about mine.

287
00:32:54,181 --> 00:32:58,982
The rabbits talked about you.
They wanted to tell you something.

288
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:17,579
Where are you going?

289
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:29,558
I'll do it.
But only if you tell me your story.

290
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:34,563
Can you stop drinking?
- No.

291
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:38,017
Can you hide your drinking?
- Yeah.

292
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,688
Where did that scar come from?

293
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:46,282
My stepbrother stabbed me
with a math compass.

294
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:49,032
You'll hear the rest
if you do your job.

295
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:53,828
You sound like
a Finnish pop song.

296
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,956
He's your grandpa.

297
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:07,758
He's your dad and my grandpa?
- Yeah.

298
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:13,226
Serves you right.
But it's so damn unfair to me.

299
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:16,392
He'll keep an eye on you
at school.

300
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:24,230
Fuck off. I ripped my ear drums
out. Don't call me again.

301
00:34:24,688 --> 00:34:27,942
I couldn't resist
your mom's kindness.

302
00:34:32,362 --> 00:34:35,912
Why are we walking?
- I don't have a bus card.

303
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:41,038
This is the first time in five
years I've woken up before eight.

304
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:01,729
You want to hear words of wisdom
or other grandpa stuff?

305
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,482
No.

306
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:10,735
When I was a kid, I heard
a story that explained everything.

307
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:15,872
After that I could understand life,
and things got better.

308
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:18,495
Everything was alright.

309
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:24,499
What was the story about?
- I can't remember, dammit.

310
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:30,213
Maybe you'll remember it again.
- I've tried to find it.

311
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:35,100
I'll go outside for a moment.

312
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:39,055
If I hear even the smallest noise,
I'll wrap you all in a mattress.

313
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:45,527
What's my job?

314
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:49,777
Sit next to her, count the days
till the end of the ninth grade -

315
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:52,408
and make sure
she doesn't beat anyone up.

316
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:54,410
Just keep an eye on her, okay?

317
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:57,573
Because of your teeth?
- Because of her mom.

318
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,743
Welcome.

319
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:21,729
You look like
you like to glue things too.

320
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:21,498
Fuck da police!

321
00:37:36,713 --> 00:37:39,136
NON-ALCOHOLIC BEER

322
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,228
Yes!

323
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:15,260
Drugs make teenagers violent.
- I'm not using anything.

324
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:18,430
I know what your problem is.

325
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:24,223
When I was a kid,
I could throw a ball really far.

326
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:27,481
I thought I'd be
the best ball thrower in the world.

327
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:30,483
Then I found out
I had a congenital heart defect-

328
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:33,270
and that I can't do sports
or drink alcohol.

329
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:36,485
Imagine not being able
to drink alcohol in Finland.

330
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:40,201
I still carry this ball with me,
but it's wrong.

331
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,580
My dream is eating me alive,
yet I cling to it.

332
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:45,665
Don't do the same.

333
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:49,044
Give up your dream
before you start doing drugs.

334
00:38:49,202 --> 00:38:50,920
Fuck off!

335
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:54,336
I'll fuck your fucking car up!

336
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:43,507
What are you doing?
- Imagining I'm a rock.

337
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,524
This is for you.

338
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:06,951
A memento for you.
I saw where Lasse's tooth fell.

339
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:10,367
I was bored in woodworking class,
so I made that.

340
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:12,456
Thanks.

341
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,838
I disinfected it.

342
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:19,627
Why do you want to be a rock?
- Throw one.

343
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,803
Cool.

344
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:36,401
I buried them over there.

345
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,904
What are they going to do to you?

346
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:44,029
They'll put me in an institution
if I don't stop beating people up.

347
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,978
Sorry.
- You killed it!

348
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:18,267
It was an accident!

349
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:28,449
Stop hitting me!

350
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:31,823
Fine, go ahead
and fucking hit me!

351
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:36,790
Shit...

352
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:52,351
You can hit me if you want.
- I don't want to.

353
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,228
Hit me!

354
00:41:58,016 --> 00:41:59,893
So you hit girls.

355
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:19,171
These make orange smoke and
smell more like shit than shit.

356
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:24,000
If I died, I'd curse my mom.
- How?

357
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,628
I'd give her gas.

358
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:31,008
What do you have against your morn?
- I pity her.

359
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:35,637
I'm smarter than her. She's older
than me, so she'll die before me.

360
00:42:36,763 --> 00:42:40,768
I like my morn. She's one
of the few people who like me.

361
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:44,688
What about your dad?
- I know nothing about him.

362
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:49,026
What would you do if you
ever met him? - I don't know.

363
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:03,047
See you tomorrow. I'll go
order the chicken fillets. - Bye.

364
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:07,961
Your dad is one sharp gentleman.

365
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:13,095
You wanted someone to keep
an eye on her; you got that.

366
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:16,594
How does the tattoo
on his shoulder look?

367
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:21,474
I gotta get a new beer keg.

368
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:25,277
I haven't checked his tattoo.
- Why not?

369
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:27,610
If he doesn't have one, -

370
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:30,946
I'll be without a dad
and my kid without a supervisor.

371
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:33,453
So you prefer
imagining he's your dad?

372
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:37,206
I don't imagine anything.
Things are what they are.

373
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:39,701
I just don't check what they are.

374
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:44,835
Remember this?

375
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:52,089
What story are you
telling about that these days?

376
00:43:52,255 --> 00:43:54,678
Whatever I think
people want to hear.

377
00:43:54,841 --> 00:43:58,641
You always bullshit.
- For some people bullshit is real.

378
00:43:59,387 --> 00:44:01,139
Catch.

379
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:10,907
Wow, that thing is still running.

380
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:14,952
You hung out with guys who
were five years older than you.

381
00:44:15,153 --> 00:44:18,123
You seemed
wild and free in the backseat.

382
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,750
You were cool.

383
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:24,166
Go out with me.

384
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:28,503
We don't go on dates here.

385
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:32,466
We get drunk and let nature
take its course. You know that.

386
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:35,552
I'll forget about the 20 euros
if you go out with me.

387
00:44:35,715 --> 00:44:38,764
I still won't.
- I could help your daughter if...

388
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:40,599
Don't blackmail me, -

389
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:44,391
or I'll test how much
you really like me beating you up.

390
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,313
I'm not blackmailing you.

391
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:50,189
I have a heart defect
but I'm not heartless. - Fuck...

392
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:54,575
It's a cold night.

393
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:58,948
Will you give me a ride home?
- Walk. I'm colder.

394
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:09,958
Here. I got you one too.

395
00:45:11,626 --> 00:45:14,345
Take it with you.
I'd throw it away.

396
00:45:31,938 --> 00:45:35,238
Where the fuck is my bus card?

397
00:46:22,697 --> 00:46:25,246
No more walking to school.

398
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:31,589
Of all the people I know, you're
the second least annoying person.

399
00:46:51,684 --> 00:46:54,813
You'll have to run if you
want a grade. If you don't, -

400
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:58,236
you might as well sign up
for unemployment benefits, -

401
00:46:58,399 --> 00:47:00,822
disability pension
or outpatient care.

402
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:02,828
But you're not running.

403
00:47:03,112 --> 00:47:06,036
You're sitting there
just like your mom used to.

404
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:08,872
Leave her the fuck alone!

405
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:16,254
You don't have to run.

406
00:47:16,709 --> 00:47:20,384
Let's go around the corner.
I'll teach you how to smoke.

407
00:47:23,466 --> 00:47:26,515
You go first.
I'll be there in a minute.

408
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:51,095
You're gonna be in deep shit.

409
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:05,322
What if I hit another rabbit?
- C'mon. Aim at the window.

410
00:49:09,447 --> 00:49:11,700
Where are we going?
- I don't know.

411
00:49:11,866 --> 00:49:14,164
Check the glove compartment
for keys.

412
00:49:14,869 --> 00:49:16,871
Just gloves.

413
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:24,299
You have a driver's license?
- No. I'm underage, moron.

414
00:49:39,435 --> 00:49:41,233
Are you a lesbian?

415
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:44,569
If someone gets pissed off
because I am, then I am.

416
00:49:44,732 --> 00:49:48,532
If no one does, I'm one anyway.
Or not. Depends on my mood.

417
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:52,198
If you get a girlfriend,
can I touch her boob?

418
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:57,833
Rain is so fucking cool.

419
00:49:58,037 --> 00:50:01,007
Why did you run
when you didn't have to?

420
00:50:02,041 --> 00:50:08,219
Running is the best way to get
away. - An airplane is better.

421
00:50:08,506 --> 00:50:12,227
I used to run away into the forest.
I'd do it pretty often.

422
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:16,309
Then I realized the forest isn't
that different from other places.

423
00:50:16,472 --> 00:50:18,691
It's the same in a different way.

424
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:26,525
Did you stop going there?
- No. I had nowhere else to go.

425
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:25,795
We won't find her. - We can't
stop. We have to keep walking.

426
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,379
It doesn't matter how much
you love your daughter -

427
00:51:29,545 --> 00:51:34,722
and how hard you look for her.
You and I won't find her.

428
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:37,052
You're wrong.

429
00:51:37,261 --> 00:51:40,481
We can walk around all night long,
but we won't find her.

430
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:44,314
I'm not looking for her
because I like her.

431
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:48,739
When I found out I was pregnant
with her, I was so mad -

432
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:52,276
that I broke the windows
of all the cars on my street.

433
00:51:52,443 --> 00:51:54,866
Then I waited for the owners
to show up.

434
00:51:55,029 --> 00:51:57,908
I hated the guy who put her
inside me so much.

435
00:51:58,073 --> 00:52:00,997
I thought, what if
she turns out to be an idiot.

436
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,504
What if she listens
to shitty music?

437
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:05,664
But then she was born.

438
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:08,422
And she melted your heart?
- No.

439
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:12,347
I looked at her and
realized no one wanted her -

440
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:16,721
and that pretty much everyone
rejected her. Even me.

441
00:52:20,429 --> 00:52:24,650
She was lying there
covered in blood and shit, -

442
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:29,439
and I realized
I have to be on her side.

443
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:32,237
I have to take care of her.

444
00:52:37,488 --> 00:52:40,412
ls that a good enough story
for you?

445
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:17,699
Why didn't you leave me there?

446
00:53:20,406 --> 00:53:23,080
Because the world is shit.
We're not.

447
00:53:26,328 --> 00:53:29,332
Goddammit.
- Don't hit her.

448
00:53:29,832 --> 00:53:31,630
I'm not going to hit her.

449
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,002
I can hit you.

450
00:53:41,093 --> 00:53:46,475
I understand. This is the magical
empire of East Vantaa -

451
00:53:46,724 --> 00:53:50,103
where dreams don't come true.
They get run over by a car, -

452
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:54,357
dragged down the street and
slammed against the wall.

453
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:57,572
I always wanted to leave too.
- Before you had me.

454
00:53:58,152 --> 00:54:00,701
Before I realized
I can't run away from me -

455
00:54:00,863 --> 00:54:04,618
even if I traveled to Mallorca.
I can't afford it. - Because of me.

456
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:09,413
Wait a couple of years.
Then you can do whatever you want.

457
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:13,133
Rip up bills, beat people up
and throw rocks?

458
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:17,801
Thanks a hell of a lot.
So you want to throw stuff at me?

459
00:54:18,172 --> 00:54:21,972
I'm in prison, but I can't stab
my enemies with a toothbrush -

460
00:54:22,134 --> 00:54:25,638
and I don't have a computer.
I can't even Google "freedom."

461
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:30,776
Stab whoever you like. As long as
you don't listen to Scooter. - Who?

462
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:36,156
If you want to hate someone,
hate me.

463
00:54:36,774 --> 00:54:39,618
Don't hate yourself or others.

464
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:43,743
You can stab these.
- I'm still in prison.

465
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:47,289
I'm the Papillon of East Vantaa.
- The what?

466
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:05,269
What kind of teen rebels
steal beer and chips?

467
00:55:05,511 --> 00:55:09,015
What do they want?
To reach middle age already?

468
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:15,237
So you know about it.
- I found out from social services.

469
00:55:15,896 --> 00:55:17,648
I can help you with Takku.

470
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:21,235
Keep her from getting
taken into custody? - That too.

471
00:55:22,653 --> 00:55:26,749
That's not enough. The stain
on her soul won't wash off.

472
00:55:29,493 --> 00:55:34,215
I know the right detergent
for the soul of a fatherless girl.

473
00:55:39,378 --> 00:55:42,552
The date.
- The date.

474
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:45,725
That's the price for the wash.

475
00:55:52,558 --> 00:55:55,778
You're not interested
in knowing where we're going?

476
00:55:56,937 --> 00:55:59,440
C‘mon, don't be so serious.

477
00:56:00,816 --> 00:56:02,818
Okay, who am I?

478
00:56:04,736 --> 00:56:07,535
You're like Markus the Retard.
- Who?

479
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:12,541
He was this retard. He was in
our class until the seventh grade.

480
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:15,373
He'd build castles in the sand.

481
00:56:15,581 --> 00:56:19,506
The rain would wash them away,
or someone would knock them down.

482
00:56:20,002 --> 00:56:21,720
I made him eat sand -

483
00:56:21,962 --> 00:56:25,182
so that he'd stop and people
would stop laughing at him.

484
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:28,389
That was the last time I cried.
- Eccentric for a girl.

485
00:56:28,552 --> 00:56:32,307
I am eccentric. Can't you see it?
You read the paper in braille?

486
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:34,895
Sure, you're eccentric.

487
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:37,777
Or you're just afraid
of being normal.

488
00:56:37,978 --> 00:56:40,731
You're afraid of
rowhouses, cashiers, -

489
00:56:40,898 --> 00:56:44,152
teachers and other boring people.

490
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:49,203
You're lonely. Only lonely people
check their phone that often.

491
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:54,912
Did Markus stop
building sand castles?

492
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:57,627
He started building them
out of clay.

493
00:56:57,831 --> 00:57:01,176
He just wanted some crazy goal.
Like you do.

494
00:57:02,461 --> 00:57:06,762
I'm not like Markus the Retard.
Everyone is.

495
00:57:13,889 --> 00:57:18,144
That's your dad. Your morn hung out
with him the most back then.

496
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:27,661
It's okay if you want to cry
again. Just let it all out.

497
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:45,049
What are you doing?

498
00:57:47,089 --> 00:57:49,308
I'm fixing this.
- Why?

499
00:57:49,758 --> 00:57:51,601
So that it'll run better.

500
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:55,765
It's just gonna break again.
- Then I can fix it again.

501
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:58,809
So you just waste
your time working.

502
00:57:59,059 --> 00:58:03,314
That's the point. Time goes by
faster when I'm working on this.

503
00:58:13,949 --> 00:58:17,374
You look like you have something
on the tip of your tongue.

504
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:25,461
Yeah, it's a piercing.
- That's all?

505
00:58:26,795 --> 00:58:30,641
Yeah. Where's the bus stop?

506
00:58:36,722 --> 00:58:38,474
See you around.

507
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:46,695
No, you'll never see me again.

508
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:49,511
The stars looked impressive
on our way here.

509
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:06,521
Did you manage to wash the problem
away? - It'll wash away in time.

510
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:08,363
Like in commercials.

511
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:12,613
You put stain remover on a shirt
and it slowly eats it away.

512
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:16,117
The stain or the whole shirt?

513
01:00:34,381 --> 01:00:36,554
Honestly, this is really good.

514
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:40,516
I'm too tired to eat.
- You can't sleep at night?

515
01:00:41,972 --> 01:00:46,273
I have this same dream every
night. - Oh yeah? What is it?

516
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:56,366
I'm in an African village
where there are only women.

517
01:00:58,113 --> 01:01:03,620
I sow crops and then hippos
eat them all. Every time.

518
01:01:05,287 --> 01:01:10,259
Pretty interesting. What do you
think it means? - I don't know.

519
01:01:13,128 --> 01:01:16,678
Well... Fucking hippos.

520
01:01:18,842 --> 01:01:21,766
Right. Fucking hippos.

521
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:26,521
I'm gonna eat
so much ice cream for dessert.

522
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:31,863
There are the stars.

523
01:01:39,446 --> 01:01:43,542
I've had this for fifteen years.
There are still four condoms left.

524
01:01:47,621 --> 01:01:52,502
I don't know what you see when
you look at me. But it's not me.

525
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:57,597
People see each other as friggin‘
lifeboats they can just grab onto.

526
01:01:57,797 --> 01:02:00,220
No, I want to help you.

527
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:12,521
Those are not stars.

528
01:02:12,771 --> 01:02:15,775
They're the chimneys
of the incineration plant.

529
01:02:19,361 --> 01:02:22,285
What if your lifeboat sinks?

530
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:27,870
Huh? What if your lifeboat sinks?

531
01:02:32,832 --> 01:02:35,881
They all have a stopper
you can pull out.

532
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,869
Did Essi really rip
her eardrums out, -

533
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:04,911
or why doesn't she answer
when her only blood relative calls?

534
01:03:08,576 --> 01:03:13,753
Has she started drinking?
- No. This is my daily dose.

535
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:18,879
Who are you? Why do you
take your daily dose here?

536
01:03:19,129 --> 01:03:21,803
I help her bring up Takku.

537
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:25,052
You're Essi‘s brother.

538
01:03:25,302 --> 01:03:28,647
She said you stabbed her
in the hand with a math compass.

539
01:03:29,556 --> 01:03:32,059
It was the other way around.

540
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:38,490
Did she say that her mom
threw a radio at her? - Yeah.

541
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:41,902
She didn't. She threw it at Mom.
- Why?

542
01:03:42,736 --> 01:03:45,956
She's always been broken like that.

543
01:03:47,073 --> 01:03:50,543
It's because of that rumor.
- What rumor?

544
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:53,462
When she was small, -

545
01:03:53,621 --> 01:03:58,548
people started saying that someone
got Mom pregnant against her will.

546
01:03:58,710 --> 01:04:01,680
They said that whoever
her dad was, was a...

547
01:04:02,756 --> 01:04:05,179
You know what I mean.

548
01:04:06,426 --> 01:04:10,932
Essi is like a broken Moomin mug.
You can't glue her together.

549
01:04:11,181 --> 01:04:13,309
But you can glue Takku.

550
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:23,027
There's my contact info.
It's a small lifesaver that floats.

551
01:04:25,445 --> 01:04:29,700
If something happens,
you can bring Takku to me.

552
01:04:30,325 --> 01:04:33,124
I can take care of her
till she's eighteen -

553
01:04:33,370 --> 01:04:36,294
and then I can get her
an apartment.

554
01:04:41,336 --> 01:04:46,217
Remember: a small lifesaver.

555
01:04:56,810 --> 01:05:03,864
How much is 1,800 plus 1,700 euros?

556
01:05:07,028 --> 01:05:09,076
I don't know.

557
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:14,787
3,500.
- Not 3,100? - No.

558
01:05:15,078 --> 01:05:19,208
Then the cash register is short
400 euros. One of you took it.

559
01:05:27,257 --> 01:05:34,516
Okay, it was you. - Bullshit.
You can't fire me without evidence.

560
01:05:34,681 --> 01:05:38,185
That's right. But if the stealing
stops, it was you.

561
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:40,445
If it doesn't, it was Essi.

562
01:05:41,896 --> 01:05:43,990
Out!

563
01:05:45,733 --> 01:05:47,701
What a dick.

564
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:09,325
How did you know I was here?

565
01:07:09,943 --> 01:07:12,071
Half of you is from me.

566
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:16,165
Like the side that likes
to sulk in weird places.

567
01:07:16,741 --> 01:07:19,415
Then I have the side
that wants to deny -

568
01:07:19,577 --> 01:07:23,878
that she cares about someone
or that she's not angry anymore.

569
01:07:24,123 --> 01:07:26,626
You have a lot of crappy sides.

570
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:31,218
My morn used to say
that love is like a child;

571
01:07:31,422 --> 01:07:33,641
you can always abandon it.

572
01:07:33,841 --> 01:07:36,344
It's scary how well
I understand her today.

573
01:07:36,511 --> 01:07:39,890
Don't abandon love
so it wouldn't abandon you.

574
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:43,484
You're smart.
- Sakke told me that.

575
01:07:43,685 --> 01:07:46,404
He's smart.
- He read it on a tea bag.

576
01:08:05,331 --> 01:08:07,880
I chose weed.

577
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:17,112
Hey.

578
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:27,835
That's what you hate, right?
You envy those two.

579
01:09:29,666 --> 01:09:32,260
That's your ball.

580
01:09:35,713 --> 01:09:38,683
I'll go say hello
to the coffee vending machine.

581
01:09:38,925 --> 01:09:42,475
If you want to rip your ball
to pieces, no one will stop you.

582
01:09:58,569 --> 01:10:03,291
Shit! - Who the hell
do you think you are?

583
01:10:06,703 --> 01:10:08,797
Fuck!

584
01:10:23,094 --> 01:10:24,937
Stop!

585
01:10:25,096 --> 01:10:26,939
Let g0!

586
01:10:30,893 --> 01:10:32,520
Hello?

587
01:10:32,687 --> 01:10:34,280
Have you heard this:

588
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:37,404
"Don't abandon love
so it won't abandon you"?

589
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:42,997
That's from a refrigerator
door magnet or something. - So?

590
01:10:43,156 --> 01:10:47,002
It doesn't mean it's not true.
I'm trying hard here.

591
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:49,663
Sure, I have
a thick armor around me.

592
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:52,081
Let go of me!
- Stop!

593
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:53,875
I said let go!

594
01:10:54,041 --> 01:10:57,011
You understand
what I'm trying to say here?

595
01:10:58,254 --> 01:11:02,430
Huh? You understand?
- Yeah.

596
01:11:04,635 --> 01:11:07,354
You called me
five minutes too late.

597
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:13,737
Huh?
- I gotta get coffee. Bye.

598
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:40,012
Sorry.

599
01:14:01,228 --> 01:14:03,196
You see anything?

600
01:14:12,907 --> 01:14:17,162
No. I see nothing.

601
01:14:18,537 --> 01:14:21,882
It's pretty dark.
- That's good.

602
01:14:22,083 --> 01:14:25,553
My neighbors are ugly.
You can't see them when it's dark.

603
01:14:33,594 --> 01:14:37,519
Why didn't you scratch those photos
instead of that kid's face?

604
01:14:37,765 --> 01:14:40,985
I'm sorry.
I cut my fingernails, -

605
01:14:41,185 --> 01:14:44,530
but it still feels
like there's skin under them.

606
01:14:44,772 --> 01:14:46,695
They're dirty.

607
01:14:54,532 --> 01:14:56,580
Are they going to take me away?

608
01:14:57,827 --> 01:15:02,549
Of course not. Lasse just texted
me, saying everything is okay.

609
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:08,008
She'll be taken into custody.
Call me. Lasse.

610
01:15:18,139 --> 01:15:23,111
If I knew how to love,
I'd love you.

611
01:16:41,305 --> 01:16:44,058
We won't take the bus
to school today.

612
01:16:47,853 --> 01:16:51,073
What's wrong with the bus?
- This is better.

613
01:16:56,904 --> 01:16:59,202
Are we even going to school?

614
01:17:01,492 --> 01:17:06,214
Your morn might not know how
to love, and I might not either, -

615
01:17:07,123 --> 01:17:10,047
but I'll take you somewhere
where they do know how.

616
01:17:15,673 --> 01:17:18,677
Calm down.
- Let me go!

617
01:17:19,385 --> 01:17:21,228
Calm down.

618
01:17:21,595 --> 01:17:23,438
Calm down.

619
01:18:22,031 --> 01:18:24,875
I'm running away from myself
to Mallorca. Takku.

620
01:19:14,541 --> 01:19:17,294
You have to take this to Mika.
- Who's he?

621
01:19:17,461 --> 01:19:19,179
He's not hard to find.

622
01:19:19,338 --> 01:19:21,966
He's got asthma,
he likes to blow things up -

623
01:19:22,132 --> 01:19:24,055
and he looks like a moron.

624
01:21:45,442 --> 01:21:47,365
Why are you taking it?

625
01:21:47,778 --> 01:21:50,372
The problem child
doesn't need it anymore.

626
01:21:50,572 --> 01:21:53,951
But her case isn't closed yet,
is it? - It's closed.

627
01:21:54,410 --> 01:21:56,913
She died at the railway station.

628
01:21:57,162 --> 01:21:59,460
A congenital heart defect.

629
01:22:00,249 --> 01:22:02,251
Just like that.

630
01:22:37,244 --> 01:22:41,249
I'm thinking about things
after everything that's happened.

631
01:22:42,291 --> 01:22:47,593
I'm not thinking
about why she rushed to the train.

632
01:22:49,131 --> 01:22:50,974
I'm not thinking about-

633
01:22:51,133 --> 01:22:54,637
why the cardboard on my car window
is taped differently.

634
01:22:55,012 --> 01:22:57,310
What are you thinking about?

635
01:22:59,433 --> 01:23:03,063
I'm thinking about what
your left shoulder looks like.

636
01:23:29,505 --> 01:23:32,304
What next?

637
01:23:37,095 --> 01:23:40,440
I know why she chose a train.

638
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:46,480
Trains never move backwards.
They always move forward.

639
01:24:28,897 --> 01:24:30,945
It's cold.

640
01:24:38,490 --> 01:24:40,333
Your daughter...

641
01:24:41,785 --> 01:24:44,038
Was she also my daughter?

642
01:24:47,708 --> 01:24:50,302
Push the button. I can't.

643
01:24:50,502 --> 01:24:52,755
DELETE ALL CONTACT DETAILS?
TAKKU

644
01:25:01,013 --> 01:25:02,936
I'm sorry.

645
01:25:08,395 --> 01:25:10,864
I'll give you
a permanent black eye.

646
01:25:49,519 --> 01:25:52,648
Are you okay?
- I'm dead. I'm not okay.

647
01:25:53,273 --> 01:25:56,652
You didn't go away?
- I'll be here as long as you are.

648
01:25:56,818 --> 01:25:59,913
Or longer if you tell people
vividly about me.

649
01:26:00,072 --> 01:26:02,621
In that case
I'm going to live really long.

650
01:26:02,783 --> 01:26:06,833
Stop eating chips. In 2036 a guy
named Korhonen will tell you -

651
01:26:07,037 --> 01:26:10,712
that the electric wire is grounded.
Don't believe him. - Okay.

652
01:26:10,874 --> 01:26:13,673
Promise me
that you'll look after my mom.

653
01:26:13,835 --> 01:26:17,135
Or she'll die alone
from chain-smoking. - How?

654
01:26:17,464 --> 01:26:21,685
I don't know. Hold her hand
or something. - Okay.

655
01:26:26,765 --> 01:26:31,441
The stars are twinkling. - Could
be the incineration plant chimneys.

656
01:27:30,162 --> 01:27:33,336
<i>I couldn't help calling you.</i>

657
01:27:34,916 --> 01:27:38,261
<i>I couldn't think of anything
to say at your place.</i>

658
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:44,932
When I was little, my dad told me
a story that comforted me.

659
01:27:46,052 --> 01:27:50,808
It made everything good.
But I forgot the story.

660
01:27:51,892 --> 01:27:55,146
<i>I've been trying
to remember it all my life.</i>

661
01:27:55,562 --> 01:27:58,691
<i>But maybe you'll ﬁnd it
for yourself some day.</i>

662
01:28:13,371 --> 01:28:17,092
What are you doing?
- Helping you by holding your hand.

663
01:28:17,292 --> 01:28:21,342
My problems are so big you can't
solve them by holding my hand.

664
01:28:26,551 --> 01:28:32,524
ls the tooth you swallowed when
you fell still inside you? - Yeah.

665
01:28:33,934 --> 01:28:36,653
You think it'll ever come out?

666
01:28:37,479 --> 01:28:41,859
I don't know. My stomach doesn't
hurt anymore. Maybe it's digested.

667
01:28:42,984 --> 01:28:45,533
Or it'll kill you one day.

668
01:28:47,447 --> 01:28:49,290
Yeah.

669
01:28:49,950 --> 01:28:52,624
Come. You can do the dishes.

670
01:28:53,286 --> 01:28:56,165
It's a good start.
- For what?

671
01:28:57,165 --> 01:29:00,339
For me not having to do the dishes.

672
01:31:31,528 --> 01:31:35,533
