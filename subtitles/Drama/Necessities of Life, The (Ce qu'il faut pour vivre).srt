2
00:10:32,345 --> 00:10:33,869
You 're...

3
00:10:33,947 --> 00:10:35,471
from Baker?

4
00:10:46,092 --> 00:10:48,720
Tell Baker I told him
all I know already.

5
00:10:48,795 --> 00:10:50,558
Tell him I want to live in peace.

6
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,962
There is no use
to go on tormenting me!

7
00:10:53,032 --> 00:10:55,967
I know nothing at all
about that case of coins.

8
00:10:56,035 --> 00:10:57,502
Now that gold has disappeared.

9
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:01,370
If he'd listened,
we could've avoided this altogether.

10
00:11:01,441 --> 00:11:03,466
I went to the army court.

11
00:11:03,543 --> 00:11:07,570
There were no witnesses.
They couldn't uncover any more.

12
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:10,309
I can't tell Baker
what happened to the money.

13
00:11:10,383 --> 00:11:12,943
Go back and tell him that.

14
00:11:14,954 --> 00:11:16,945
Word's around you had a visitor.

15
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:20,858
And Baker knows it.

16
00:11:22,862 --> 00:11:24,762
Name of Jackson.

17
00:11:28,001 --> 00:11:29,832
Well...

18
00:11:29,902 --> 00:11:32,166
Jackson was here...

19
00:11:33,506 --> 00:11:35,997
...or Baker's got it all wrong.

20
00:11:43,549 --> 00:11:45,039
He's not wrong.

21
00:11:45,818 --> 00:11:50,721
Maybe Baker would like to know just
what you and Jackson had to say

22
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:53,190
about the cash box.

23
00:11:56,696 --> 00:11:59,859
That's not what
I'm being paid for.

24
00:12:03,336 --> 00:12:07,432
I'm only interested in what name
Jackson's hiding under now.

25
00:12:10,543 --> 00:12:13,307
Why do you think Jackson
may be assuming another name?

26
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:15,279
I would've found him already.

27
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:19,817
When I start off
to find somebody, I find him.

28
00:12:19,886 --> 00:12:21,911
That's why they pay me.

29
00:12:27,427 --> 00:12:29,691
What is Baker paying you?

30
00:12:32,765 --> 00:12:34,062
That your family?

31
00:12:44,243 --> 00:12:45,801
Yes.

32
00:12:45,878 --> 00:12:48,142
Nice family.

33
00:12:50,483 --> 00:12:52,974
What does he pay you
for murdering me?

34
00:12:56,122 --> 00:12:58,647
$500...

35
00:12:58,724 --> 00:13:00,453
to get the name.

36
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:08,293
The name.

37
00:13:17,643 --> 00:13:20,441
Carson. Bill Carson.

38
00:13:21,314 --> 00:13:23,908
That's what he calls himself now.

39
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,978
That's a lot
of money... 1,000.

40
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,785
$1,000?

41
00:14:05,158 --> 00:14:06,819
And some in gold.

42
00:14:06,893 --> 00:14:09,225
That's a tidy sum.

43
00:14:12,932 --> 00:14:17,960
But when I'm paid,
I always see the job through.

44
00:15:30,409 --> 00:15:32,104
It's you.

45
00:15:32,178 --> 00:15:33,839
Any information?

46
00:15:36,082 --> 00:15:37,413
Too much.

47
00:15:39,151 --> 00:15:41,676
He said quite a bit
that should interest you

48
00:15:41,754 --> 00:15:44,655
and one or two things
that interested me.

49
00:15:44,724 --> 00:15:46,055
Such as?

50
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,895
The name Jackson's
hiding under is Bill Carson.

51
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:55,232
That's your bit.

52
00:15:58,104 --> 00:15:59,230
Keep talking.

53
00:15:59,972 --> 00:16:04,204
He also mentioned something
about a certain cash box

54
00:16:04,277 --> 00:16:06,211
which just happened
to disappear.

55
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:10,071
- That's my bit.
- Anything else?

56
00:16:11,317 --> 00:16:13,478
Not enough for you, eh?

57
00:16:13,552 --> 00:16:15,713
Well, you don't have to worry.

58
00:16:15,788 --> 00:16:17,779
He'll never say anything
to anybody again.

59
00:16:17,857 --> 00:16:20,621
Oh, yeah. Yeah, perfect.

60
00:16:21,427 --> 00:16:23,327
Here. Here you are.

61
00:16:23,963 --> 00:16:25,760
Here. This is for you.

62
00:16:25,831 --> 00:16:27,458
You did a good job for me...

63
00:16:27,533 --> 00:16:29,933
worth $500.

64
00:16:32,371 --> 00:16:35,067
Yeah. I almost forgot.

65
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:38,036
He gave me 1,000.

66
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:41,341
I think his idea
was that I kill you.

67
00:16:47,787 --> 00:16:49,948
But you know, the pity is,
when I'm paid,

68
00:16:50,022 --> 00:16:53,116
I always follow my job through.

69
00:16:53,192 --> 00:16:55,126
You know that.

70
00:16:55,194 --> 00:16:57,662
No! Angel Eyes!

71
00:17:42,241 --> 00:17:44,232
No. No pistol, amigo.

72
00:17:44,377 --> 00:17:48,177
It won't do you any good.
There are three of us.

73
00:18:02,795 --> 00:18:04,160
Hey, amigo...

74
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:09,429
You know you got a face beautiful
enough to be worth $2,000?

75
00:18:11,704 --> 00:18:13,001
Yeah...

76
00:18:14,707 --> 00:18:17,835
But you don't look
like the one who'll collect it.

77
00:18:25,351 --> 00:18:27,444
A couple steps back.

78
00:19:21,674 --> 00:19:23,403
Thank you.

79
00:19:32,685 --> 00:19:34,880
How much are you worth now?

80
00:19:34,954 --> 00:19:36,649
How much?

81
00:19:37,189 --> 00:19:39,487
$2,000.

82
00:19:41,527 --> 00:19:44,257
That's right. $2,000.

83
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:46,491
$2,000.

84
00:19:47,766 --> 00:19:49,165
Not bad.

85
00:19:55,107 --> 00:19:56,597
You 'll pay for this!

86
00:19:56,675 --> 00:19:59,371
I hope you end up
in a graveyard

87
00:19:59,445 --> 00:20:02,312
with the cholera
and the rabies and the plague!

88
00:20:02,381 --> 00:20:03,609
Cut me loose!

89
00:20:03,682 --> 00:20:05,877
Cut me loose,
you filthy bastard!

90
00:20:05,951 --> 00:20:07,441
Put me down!

91
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,580
I hope your mother
ends up in a $2 whorehouse!

92
00:20:10,656 --> 00:20:13,056
Cut me loose!
Cut me loose!

93
00:20:13,926 --> 00:20:15,985
You can still save yourself.

94
00:20:16,061 --> 00:20:18,962
Let me go,
and I'll pardon you.

95
00:20:19,031 --> 00:20:20,965
Let me go!

96
00:20:21,033 --> 00:20:23,024
I think I feel sick.

97
00:20:23,102 --> 00:20:25,832
The blood
is bursting through my...

98
00:20:25,905 --> 00:20:27,566
I'm dry, Blondie.

99
00:20:28,274 --> 00:20:30,868
Agua. Water.

100
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:39,749
You slime!
You son of a bitch.

101
00:20:39,818 --> 00:20:41,649
Let me go!

102
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,915
You 're brave
with a man who's tied up!

103
00:20:43,989 --> 00:20:46,958
Come back!
Come back and fight...

104
00:20:47,026 --> 00:20:50,257
You bastard!

105
00:20:51,163 --> 00:20:52,824
Who the hell is that?

106
00:20:52,898 --> 00:20:55,162
One bastard goes in,
another comes out.

107
00:20:55,234 --> 00:20:56,826
Cut it out!
Cut it out!

108
00:20:56,902 --> 00:21:00,235
I'm an honest farmer!
I'm innocent of any...

109
00:21:02,942 --> 00:21:04,842
So you 're an honest farmer.

110
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:06,639
You recognize this man?

111
00:21:06,712 --> 00:21:09,442
- Me?
- Yeah, it's you.

112
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:14,408
Me? Who says so?
You can't even read.

113
00:21:14,486 --> 00:21:16,545
Yeah, roll it up!
Roll it up!

114
00:21:16,622 --> 00:21:19,147
I'll give you a good idea
where you can put it.

115
00:21:19,224 --> 00:21:22,955
To hell with all you sheriffs
and all who gave birth to you!

116
00:21:23,028 --> 00:21:26,156
Everybody, look!
He's giving him the filthy money!

117
00:21:26,231 --> 00:21:29,462
Judas!
You sold my hide!

118
00:21:29,535 --> 00:21:31,867
But you won't
enjoy that money, not a penny.

119
00:21:31,937 --> 00:21:33,370
If there's justice
in the world,

120
00:21:33,439 --> 00:21:35,839
that money will go
to the undertakers, every penny of it!

121
00:21:35,908 --> 00:21:37,876
You know who you are?

122
00:21:37,943 --> 00:21:40,275
You want to know
whose son you are?

123
00:21:40,346 --> 00:21:42,746
You don't. I do.
Everybody does.

124
00:21:42,815 --> 00:21:46,649
You 're the son of a thousand fathers,
all bastards like you.

125
00:21:46,719 --> 00:21:49,051
And your mother...
Your mother, she's...

126
00:21:49,121 --> 00:21:51,214
You bastard!

127
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:54,759
Your mother... it's better
not to talk of her!

128
00:21:54,827 --> 00:21:56,419
I never hurt anybody!

129
00:21:56,762 --> 00:22:00,493
Wanted in 14 counties
of this state,

130
00:22:00,566 --> 00:22:05,128
the condemned is found guilty
of the crimes of murder,

131
00:22:05,204 --> 00:22:09,766
armed robbery of citizens,
state banks, and post offices,

132
00:22:09,842 --> 00:22:14,279
the theft of sacred objects,
arson in a state prison,

133
00:22:14,346 --> 00:22:18,783
perjury, bigamy,
deserting his wife and children,

134
00:22:18,851 --> 00:22:22,719
inciting prostitution,
kidnapping, extortion,

135
00:22:22,788 --> 00:22:26,224
receiving stolen goods,
selling stolen goods,

136
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:27,724
passing counterfeit money,

137
00:22:27,793 --> 00:22:31,229
and, contrary to the laws
of this state,

138
00:22:31,296 --> 00:22:35,733
the condemned is guilty
of using marked cards and loaded dice.

139
00:22:35,801 --> 00:22:39,828
Therefore, according
to the powers vested in us,

140
00:22:39,905 --> 00:22:42,601
we sentence the accused
here before us...

141
00:22:42,675 --> 00:22:46,805
Tuco Benedicto Pacifico
Juan Maria Ramirez...

142
00:22:46,879 --> 00:22:48,073
Known as ''The Rat.''

143
00:22:48,147 --> 00:22:51,674
...and any other aliases
he might have...

144
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,775
to hang by the neck until dead.

145
00:22:53,852 --> 00:22:56,821
May God have mercy
on his soul. Proceed.

146
00:23:23,115 --> 00:23:25,379
Five for you...

147
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:29,814
Five for me.

148
00:23:31,523 --> 00:23:33,753
Five for you...

149
00:23:33,826 --> 00:23:35,919
and five for me.

150
00:23:36,595 --> 00:23:38,688
Know how much
you 're worth now?

151
00:23:38,764 --> 00:23:40,732
No. How much?

152
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,323
$3,000.

153
00:23:45,938 --> 00:23:48,406
There are two kinds
of people in the world, my friend...

154
00:23:48,474 --> 00:23:50,305
those with a rope
around their neck

155
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:53,037
and the people who have
the job of doing the cutting.

156
00:23:53,112 --> 00:23:56,377
Listen, the neck at the end
of the rope is mine.

157
00:23:56,448 --> 00:23:58,643
I run the risks.

158
00:23:58,717 --> 00:24:02,585
So the next time,
I want more than half.

159
00:24:02,654 --> 00:24:05,054
You may run the risks,
my friend,

160
00:24:05,124 --> 00:24:06,955
but I do the cutting.

161
00:24:08,427 --> 00:24:11,590
If we cut down
my percentage...

162
00:24:12,264 --> 00:24:13,424
Cigar?

163
00:24:15,834 --> 00:24:18,234
Liable to interfere
with my aim.

164
00:24:20,739 --> 00:24:23,674
But if you miss,
you had better miss very well.

165
00:24:24,643 --> 00:24:28,238
Whoever double-crosses me
and leaves me alive,

166
00:24:28,313 --> 00:24:31,612
he understands nothing
about Tuco.

167
00:24:32,484 --> 00:24:34,179
Nothing.

168
00:24:37,756 --> 00:24:39,986
...wanted in 15 counties
of this state.

169
00:24:40,058 --> 00:24:42,356
The condemned
standing before us...

170
00:24:42,427 --> 00:24:43,860
sitting before us...

171
00:24:43,929 --> 00:24:47,228
Tuco Benedicto Pacifico
Juan Maria Ramirez...

172
00:24:47,299 --> 00:24:49,893
has been found guilty
by the Third District Circuit Court

173
00:24:49,968 --> 00:24:51,401
of the following crimes...

174
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:53,870
murder, assaulting
a justice of the peace,

175
00:24:53,939 --> 00:24:56,271
raping a virgin
of the white race,

176
00:24:56,341 --> 00:24:59,902
statutory rape of a minor
of the black race,

177
00:25:00,012 --> 00:25:02,446
derailing a train in order
to rob the passengers...

178
00:25:02,681 --> 00:25:04,478
Angel Eyes!

179
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:06,381
...highway robbery,

180
00:25:06,451 --> 00:25:09,978
robbing an unknown number
of post offices...

181
00:25:10,055 --> 00:25:11,750
What'd you find out, Shorty?

182
00:25:11,824 --> 00:25:13,815
If you ask me,
seems like a book...

183
00:25:13,892 --> 00:25:16,656
an armed unit escorting
a cash box of gold coins

184
00:25:16,728 --> 00:25:20,255
meets a Yankee ambush,
and only three of them are saved...

185
00:25:20,332 --> 00:25:23,130
Stevens, Baker, and Jackson.

186
00:25:23,202 --> 00:25:25,636
The thing that wasn't
saved was the coins.

187
00:25:25,704 --> 00:25:29,765
The army decides to hold
a hearing, and Jackson's acquitted.

188
00:25:29,842 --> 00:25:32,743
He disappears
and becomes Bill Carson.

189
00:25:32,811 --> 00:25:33,971
I know his name.

190
00:25:34,046 --> 00:25:36,981
You don't know just who
you 're looking for. I do.

191
00:25:37,049 --> 00:25:40,610
When he's found,
I'd be scared to be put in his shoes.

192
00:25:43,355 --> 00:25:44,754
Where is Carson?

193
00:25:44,823 --> 00:25:48,020
Carson re-enlisted.
The poor guy's minus an eye.

194
00:25:48,093 --> 00:25:50,288
He lives with a girl
called Maria who'll tell you.

195
00:25:50,362 --> 00:25:52,455
She's a fresh young whore
in the territory.

196
00:25:52,531 --> 00:25:53,828
Where's she?

197
00:25:53,899 --> 00:25:55,799
Now, what's the name
of that town?

198
00:25:55,868 --> 00:25:57,665
Someplace fairly near.

199
00:26:00,138 --> 00:26:01,503
Santa Ana.

200
00:26:04,476 --> 00:26:07,673
Adios, half-soldier.

201
00:26:07,746 --> 00:26:11,182
...detention and selling
fugitive slaves, burning down...

202
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:13,377
Luke, hand me down a whiskey.

203
00:26:13,452 --> 00:26:15,545
...and the sheriff's office
in Sonora.

204
00:26:15,621 --> 00:26:18,715
The condemned hired himself out
as a guide to a wagon train.

205
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:22,385
After receiving his payment,
he deserted the wagon train

206
00:26:22,461 --> 00:26:24,759
on the hunting grounds
of the Sioux Indians.

207
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:28,493
Glad they got him...
a man guilty of all those crimes.

208
00:26:28,567 --> 00:26:30,558
People with ropes around
their necks don't always hang.

209
00:26:30,636 --> 00:26:32,501
What do you mean?

210
00:26:32,571 --> 00:26:34,300
The condemned
is also guilty of...

211
00:26:34,373 --> 00:26:37,536
Even a filthy beggar like that
has got a protecting angel.

212
00:26:41,146 --> 00:26:44,582
...and misrepresenting himself
as a Mexican general.

213
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:46,982
A golden-haired angel
watches over him.

214
00:26:47,052 --> 00:26:48,417
...from the Union Army.

215
00:26:48,487 --> 00:26:52,321
For all these crimes, the accused
has made a full confession.

216
00:26:52,391 --> 00:26:55,792
Therefore, we condemn him
to be hung by the neck until dead.

217
00:26:55,861 --> 00:26:58,887
May the Lord have mercy
on his soul. Proceed.

218
00:27:14,479 --> 00:27:16,811
Let's get the hell
out of here!

219
00:27:48,113 --> 00:27:50,741
What are you trying to say?
''Anybody can miss a shot''?

220
00:27:50,816 --> 00:27:52,909
Nobody misses when I'm
at the end of the rope.

221
00:27:52,985 --> 00:27:56,079
You never had a rope
around your neck.

222
00:27:56,154 --> 00:27:58,213
When that rope
starts to pull tight,

223
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:01,589
you can feel the devil
fight your ass.

224
00:28:03,795 --> 00:28:05,956
Yeah, you 're right.

225
00:28:06,031 --> 00:28:08,659
It's getting tougher.

226
00:28:09,167 --> 00:28:13,126
The way I figure,
there's really not too much future

227
00:28:13,205 --> 00:28:15,400
with a sawed-off runt like you.

228
00:28:15,474 --> 00:28:16,736
What do you mean?

229
00:28:16,808 --> 00:28:20,710
'Cause I don't think you 'll
ever be worth more than $3,000.

230
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:23,109
What do you mean?

231
00:28:23,715 --> 00:28:26,684
I mean our partnership is untied.

232
00:28:28,053 --> 00:28:31,614
No. Not you.
You remain tied.

233
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:34,022
I'll keep the money,
and you can have the rope.

234
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,955
You filthy,
double-crossing bastard!

235
00:28:37,029 --> 00:28:38,826
Of all the stinking,
dirty trick...

236
00:28:38,897 --> 00:28:42,025
The way back to town
is only 70 miles.

237
00:28:43,068 --> 00:28:46,333
If you save your breath, I feel
a man like you could manage it.

238
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,200
Adios.

239
00:28:49,274 --> 00:28:51,435
You filthy bastard!
Come here!

240
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:53,535
Come here!
Cut this rope off!

241
00:28:53,612 --> 00:28:56,945
Get off that horse,
you filthy coward!

242
00:28:57,015 --> 00:29:00,280
If I ever catch you,
I'll rip your heart out and eat it.

243
00:29:00,352 --> 00:29:02,718
I'll skin you alive!
I'll hang you by your thumbs!

244
00:29:02,788 --> 00:29:04,619
You pig! You vulture!

245
00:29:04,689 --> 00:29:06,657
I'll kill you!

246
00:29:06,825 --> 00:29:08,019
I'll kill you!

247
00:29:10,128 --> 00:29:14,394
Such ingratitude after all
the times I've saved your life.

248
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:22,033
Where are you going?
This is only a trick!

249
00:29:22,107 --> 00:29:25,270
You wouldn't leave me here!
Come back!

250
00:29:25,343 --> 00:29:26,605
Wait! Blondie!

251
00:29:26,678 --> 00:29:28,578
Listen, Blondie!

252
00:29:53,271 --> 00:29:55,705
I believe madam is home.

253
00:29:56,541 --> 00:29:59,738
Sweet dreams
and many thanks!

254
00:30:09,454 --> 00:30:11,547
You filthy rats!

255
00:30:27,739 --> 00:30:29,070
Maria?

256
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,880
Honey.
Is that you, Bill?

257
00:30:39,251 --> 00:30:40,809
Bill!

258
00:30:50,362 --> 00:30:53,331
Who are you?
What do you want with me?

259
00:30:54,299 --> 00:30:57,063
Go on talking about Bill Carson.

260
00:30:57,736 --> 00:30:59,363
I don't know him.

261
00:31:00,872 --> 00:31:03,170
You were calling to him
in the dark.

262
00:31:07,746 --> 00:31:08,906
Where is he?

263
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:11,312
What are you
going to do to him?

264
00:31:12,684 --> 00:31:14,879
I'll ask the questions.

265
00:31:16,688 --> 00:31:18,383
Where is he?

266
00:31:25,864 --> 00:31:29,300
Where is he?
Where? Where?

267
00:31:35,574 --> 00:31:36,734
That's enough!

268
00:31:38,877 --> 00:31:40,367
I don't know where he is.

269
00:31:40,445 --> 00:31:43,972
He packed his things ten days ago
and went away with his unit.

270
00:31:44,049 --> 00:31:45,812
They all left.

271
00:31:45,884 --> 00:31:48,011
Which company?
Where'd they go.

272
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:53,514
Third Cavalry.

273
00:31:53,592 --> 00:31:55,617
General Sibley.

274
00:31:55,694 --> 00:31:57,025
They left for Santa Fe.

275
00:31:57,996 --> 00:32:00,658
That's all I know.
I swear!

276
00:33:33,124 --> 00:33:35,684
I'm very sorry,
but the store's closing.

277
00:34:13,865 --> 00:34:17,232
- Revolvers.
- Yeah, revolvers.

278
00:34:21,206 --> 00:34:22,366
Revolvers!

279
00:34:23,508 --> 00:34:26,944
Well, here's where
I keep the best ones.

280
00:34:31,616 --> 00:34:34,380
Here... Remington, Colt,

281
00:34:34,452 --> 00:34:37,944
a Roat,
and a Smith-Wesson.

282
00:34:38,022 --> 00:34:40,820
Colt... it's navy.

283
00:34:40,892 --> 00:34:42,325
Joslyn.

284
00:34:42,394 --> 00:34:44,259
Another Remington.

285
00:34:44,329 --> 00:34:46,160
- And this one is...
- That's enough.

286
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,300
Cartridges.

287
00:35:39,484 --> 00:35:42,009
You want to try the pistol?
Just step out back.

288
00:35:42,086 --> 00:35:43,246
Let's go.

289
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,694
M ovo M ovo

290
00:37:05,803 --> 00:37:07,498
Cartridge.

291
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:18,840
- How much?
- $20.

292
00:37:21,052 --> 00:37:22,679
No.

293
00:37:25,657 --> 00:37:27,682
$50.

294
00:37:28,726 --> 00:37:30,557
How much?

295
00:37:31,129 --> 00:37:33,120
$100.

296
00:37:35,633 --> 00:37:37,191
$200.

297
00:37:37,268 --> 00:37:38,860
It's all I've got.

298
00:37:39,504 --> 00:37:40,869
Here.

299
00:38:00,525 --> 00:38:01,685
Come here.

300
00:38:21,279 --> 00:38:23,577
If you work for a living,

301
00:38:23,648 --> 00:38:26,674
why do you
kill yourself working?

302
00:39:03,855 --> 00:39:06,585
If you work for a living,

303
00:39:06,658 --> 00:39:10,685
why do you
kill yourself working?

304
00:39:36,554 --> 00:39:38,488
Potatoes.

305
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:42,757
You 've gotta be poor
to eat potatoes.

306
00:39:43,561 --> 00:39:45,654
Really poor.

307
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:49,791
I'm rich.
But I'm lonely.

308
00:39:51,703 --> 00:39:54,331
The world is divided
into two parts...

309
00:39:54,405 --> 00:39:56,396
those who have friends

310
00:39:56,474 --> 00:40:00,240
and those who are lonely
like poor Tuco.

311
00:40:02,113 --> 00:40:07,278
You see, I used to have
a friend... Pedro.

312
00:40:07,985 --> 00:40:11,546
Chico and Ramon... his two brothers
were my friends, too.

313
00:40:14,959 --> 00:40:17,621
But who knows
where they are now?

314
00:40:19,063 --> 00:40:22,897
It's too bad, friends.
Tough luck I haven't found you.

315
00:40:22,967 --> 00:40:25,162
I had a good deal for you.

316
00:40:27,538 --> 00:40:31,440
There's a big son of a bitch
who's got $4,000.

317
00:40:32,376 --> 00:40:35,243
$4,000.

318
00:40:36,147 --> 00:40:37,876
And I know where to find it.

319
00:40:40,218 --> 00:40:42,846
If they would help me catch him,

320
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,684
I'd divide it four ways,
like a brother.

321
00:40:46,257 --> 00:40:49,351
$1,000 each.

322
00:41:06,611 --> 00:41:08,704
You 're alive, Tuco.
Is it true?

323
00:41:12,383 --> 00:41:15,045
He's rich,
like you 're going to be.

324
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:18,088
But people are saying
you got killed in Albuquerque.

325
00:41:18,156 --> 00:41:20,454
And people talk bullshit.

326
00:41:24,228 --> 00:41:27,391
I'm alive, you bastards,
and I always will be.

327
00:41:27,465 --> 00:41:30,957
And I've come
to give you $3,000.

328
00:41:31,035 --> 00:41:32,332
Vamos.

329
00:41:49,253 --> 00:41:51,312
This morning I heard
the whole thing.

330
00:41:51,389 --> 00:41:53,789
Colonel Canby's
closing in with his Northerners.

331
00:41:53,858 --> 00:41:56,452
No later than tomorrow,
they'll be in the city.

332
00:41:56,527 --> 00:41:59,428
That's why these Southerners
are getting out.

333
00:41:59,497 --> 00:42:02,955
As soon as these cowards
hear a blue shirt's around, they run.

334
00:42:03,868 --> 00:42:05,699
These rebels
have no will to fight.

335
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:08,500
- Poor things.
- They'll soon be finished.

336
00:42:08,573 --> 00:42:09,972
We get rid of these bastards,

337
00:42:10,041 --> 00:42:12,236
then we begin making
money on those Yankees.

338
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:14,540
They carry gold,
not paper dollars.

339
00:42:14,612 --> 00:42:17,046
And they're going
to beat the South.

340
00:42:17,682 --> 00:42:21,049
Look. See that one with
the white beard sitting in the wagon?

341
00:42:21,118 --> 00:42:23,052
General Sibley.
He looks dead.

342
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,145
He's finally getting
out of our hair.

343
00:42:25,223 --> 00:42:29,785
Hooray for Dixie! Hooray!
Hooray for Dixie!

344
00:42:33,764 --> 00:42:36,028
Where's the owner
of that horse?

345
00:42:36,734 --> 00:42:40,033
- Please, sir, a bad heart...
- Where?

346
00:42:40,104 --> 00:42:42,800
The war has
frightened me already.

347
00:42:42,874 --> 00:42:45,342
I'm looking
for the owner of that horse.

348
00:42:45,409 --> 00:42:49,004
He's tall, blond,
he smokes a cigar, and he's a pig.

349
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,173
- Where is he now?
- Leave him be.

350
00:42:51,249 --> 00:42:53,240
He doesn't know
who rides every horse.

351
00:42:53,317 --> 00:42:55,808
You stay quiet, old hen.

352
00:42:57,121 --> 00:43:00,818
Upstairs.
Upstairs in room four, señor.

353
00:43:06,364 --> 00:43:07,922
Hear that?

354
00:43:13,204 --> 00:43:15,934
You rotten criminals.
How dare you?

355
00:46:30,868 --> 00:46:32,699
Your spurs.

356
00:46:47,618 --> 00:46:50,314
There are two kinds
of spurs, my friend...

357
00:46:50,387 --> 00:46:53,185
those that come in
by the door...

358
00:46:53,257 --> 00:46:55,919
those that come in
by the window.

359
00:46:55,993 --> 00:46:57,722
Take off that pistol belt.

360
00:47:05,669 --> 00:47:07,227
It's empty.

361
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:11,503
Mine isn't.

362
00:47:17,781 --> 00:47:21,911
Even when Judas hanged himself,
there was a storm, too.

363
00:47:25,156 --> 00:47:27,647
That could be cannon fire.

364
00:47:27,725 --> 00:47:30,853
Cannon fire or storm,
it's all the same to you.

365
00:47:33,564 --> 00:47:36,692
You ever see this before,
my friend?

366
00:47:46,143 --> 00:47:47,906
Throw it over the roof beam.

367
00:47:50,114 --> 00:47:51,445
That's it.

368
00:48:03,093 --> 00:48:04,958
Now get on that.

369
00:48:14,939 --> 00:48:16,270
That's right.

370
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:18,501
Now make sure
the rope is tight.

371
00:48:19,743 --> 00:48:22,337
It's got to hold
the weight of a pig.

372
00:48:28,752 --> 00:48:30,982
Now put the rope
around your neck.

373
00:48:38,362 --> 00:48:39,954
That's very good.

374
00:48:40,998 --> 00:48:43,228
It's too big
for your neck, huh?

375
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:45,200
We'll fix that right away.

376
00:48:45,269 --> 00:48:49,467
I have another system,
a little different than yours.

377
00:48:50,341 --> 00:48:52,002
I don't shoot the rope.

378
00:48:52,076 --> 00:48:54,601
I shoot the legs off the stool.

379
00:48:59,083 --> 00:49:00,812
Adios.

380
00:52:10,741 --> 00:52:11,969
Welcome, my friend.

381
00:52:12,042 --> 00:52:15,068
If you 're looking
for a summer vacation spot,

382
00:52:15,145 --> 00:52:16,305
you 've found it.

383
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:19,907
Our hotel is luxurious
and filled with conveniences.

384
00:52:21,585 --> 00:52:23,678
And the attractions
don't stop there.

385
00:52:23,754 --> 00:52:25,722
International cuisine,

386
00:52:25,789 --> 00:52:27,984
healthful and nutritious food.

387
00:52:28,058 --> 00:52:30,185
Corn cobs, Dixie style.

388
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:32,888
Our government
has spared no expense.

389
00:52:32,963 --> 00:52:35,932
As you can see,
we are treated very well.

390
00:52:35,999 --> 00:52:39,264
Have you ever heard of anyone
by the name of Bill Carson?

391
00:52:39,336 --> 00:52:44,672
And you... have you ever heard
of someone named Canby? No?

392
00:52:44,741 --> 00:52:49,110
He's a Yankee colonel
who decided to tear us to pieces.

393
00:52:49,179 --> 00:52:52,239
The only thing we care about
is saving our own hides.

394
00:52:52,316 --> 00:52:55,308
And you ask me if I know someone.

395
00:52:55,385 --> 00:52:57,945
I just don't know what
you drifters could be thinking.

396
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:14,131
Carson has a patch over one eye.
He's with the Third.

397
00:53:16,039 --> 00:53:18,337
If he's with the Third,

398
00:53:18,408 --> 00:53:21,900
they've already left for Glorietta.

399
00:53:21,979 --> 00:53:26,348
Canby's front line is right on their heels,
those poor young devils.

400
00:53:26,416 --> 00:53:28,611
And the desert lies ahead of them.

401
00:53:28,685 --> 00:53:32,246
I really doubt that
any of them are still alive.

402
00:53:32,322 --> 00:53:34,882
And what if they were still alive?

403
00:53:37,427 --> 00:53:39,395
Worse.

404
00:53:39,463 --> 00:53:42,762
You must not have heard
anything about Batterville.

405
00:53:42,833 --> 00:53:45,529
It's one of those
Yankee prison camps

406
00:53:45,602 --> 00:53:48,264
you 'd better hope
you never end up in.

407
00:53:49,239 --> 00:53:51,264
Keep it, it's yours.

408
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:20,081
We have found the accused,
Thomas Larson, alias Shorty Larson,

409
00:56:20,157 --> 00:56:23,718
guilty of the following crimes...

410
00:56:23,794 --> 00:56:24,954
horse theft,

411
00:56:25,028 --> 00:56:27,428
theft of supplies
belonging to the Union Army,

412
00:56:27,497 --> 00:56:30,432
theft of supplies belonging
to the Confederate Army,

413
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:32,434
wounding two vigilantes,

414
00:56:32,502 --> 00:56:35,096
assault and battery
on one named Garry O'Keefe,

415
00:56:35,172 --> 00:56:38,232
burglary, blackmail, robbery,

416
00:56:38,308 --> 00:56:40,708
escaping from a state prison,

417
00:56:40,777 --> 00:56:42,677
disturbing the peace,
pandering...

418
00:56:42,746 --> 00:56:44,145
And Shorty?

419
00:56:44,781 --> 00:56:46,248
...forgery, and murder.

420
00:56:46,316 --> 00:56:49,012
Therefore, with the powers
vested in us...

421
00:56:49,086 --> 00:56:50,075
No.

422
00:56:50,721 --> 00:56:51,710
No?

423
00:56:51,788 --> 00:56:53,915
...the aforementioned
Thomas Larson,

424
00:56:53,990 --> 00:56:56,254
alias Shorty Larson,

425
00:56:56,326 --> 00:56:58,191
to hang by the neck until dead.

426
00:56:58,261 --> 00:57:01,355
May God have mercy
on his soul. Proceed.

427
00:57:07,838 --> 00:57:09,533
Sorry, Shorty.

428
00:57:38,301 --> 00:57:41,327
As soon as I hit the desert,
I'm thirsty.

429
00:57:41,404 --> 00:57:42,837
Burns, huh?

430
00:57:42,906 --> 00:57:47,309
They say people with fair skin
can't take too much.

431
00:58:10,634 --> 00:58:13,364
Like that, you won't
have to carry so much.

432
00:58:15,238 --> 00:58:16,728
Where are we going?

433
00:58:17,741 --> 00:58:19,072
Where?

434
00:58:19,142 --> 00:58:22,134
Where I'm going, amigo.

435
00:58:22,212 --> 00:58:23,873
Over that way.

436
00:58:23,947 --> 00:58:28,043
Another hundred miles
of beautiful sun-baked sand.

437
00:58:28,118 --> 00:58:30,518
Even the armies are afraid
to march through there.

438
00:58:30,587 --> 00:58:32,953
Sibley's men
are retreating up there.

439
00:58:33,023 --> 00:58:35,253
Canby's men are coming here.

440
00:58:36,426 --> 00:58:40,419
But no one will set foot
in this hell...

441
00:58:40,497 --> 00:58:43,261
except you and me.

442
00:58:44,401 --> 00:58:46,631
100 miles.
That's a nice walk.

443
00:58:50,473 --> 00:58:53,306
What was it you told me
the last time?

444
00:58:54,978 --> 00:58:58,971
''lf you save your breath, I feel
a man like you could manage it.''

445
00:59:01,017 --> 00:59:04,077
And if you won't manage it,
you 'll die...

446
00:59:04,154 --> 00:59:05,553
only slowly.

447
00:59:06,723 --> 00:59:09,715
Very slowly, old friend.

448
00:59:14,130 --> 00:59:17,361
After you, please.
Start walking.

449
01:01:13,950 --> 01:01:15,577
Taking a rest?

450
01:01:16,219 --> 01:01:19,120
Come on, Blondie,
we don't have very far to go.

451
01:01:19,189 --> 01:01:21,020
Only 70 miles.

452
01:01:22,359 --> 01:01:25,988
Only 81/2 hours more
before sunset.

453
01:01:26,062 --> 01:01:28,121
That's not too bad.

454
01:01:29,532 --> 01:01:31,056
Come on.

455
01:03:21,744 --> 01:03:24,076
Okay, let's eat.

456
01:03:24,147 --> 01:03:26,513
That is, I'll eat.

457
01:03:29,652 --> 01:03:32,450
Meanwhile, you can
enjoy a sunbath.

458
01:03:41,931 --> 01:03:43,626
You want some water?

459
01:03:48,438 --> 01:03:49,996
Drink. Drink.

460
01:03:55,845 --> 01:03:58,211
Come on, come on.

461
01:04:39,088 --> 01:04:42,285
Well, Blondie, so long.

462
01:05:49,459 --> 01:05:51,654
And so, Blondie...

463
01:05:53,796 --> 01:05:56,026
...it's good-bye.

464
01:06:59,295 --> 01:07:00,887
Easy. Easy.

465
01:07:00,963 --> 01:07:03,056
Easy. Easy. Attaboy.

466
01:09:32,748 --> 01:09:34,443
Water...

467
01:09:34,517 --> 01:09:35,677
Water.

468
01:09:42,091 --> 01:09:43,888
200,000 in gold.

469
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:46,485
It's yours.
Just get me water.

470
01:09:51,133 --> 01:09:53,067
What's that you say?

471
01:09:53,135 --> 01:09:55,194
Who the hell are you?

472
01:09:55,271 --> 01:09:57,262
Carson...

473
01:09:57,340 --> 01:09:59,808
My name is Bill Carson now.

474
01:10:00,343 --> 01:10:02,140
Surprise attack.

475
01:10:03,546 --> 01:10:04,911
All dead.

476
01:10:07,850 --> 01:10:11,547
Carson, yeah. Glad to meet you.
I'm Lincoln's grandfather.

477
01:10:11,621 --> 01:10:13,953
What was that you said
about the dollars?

478
01:10:14,023 --> 01:10:16,253
200,000. All mine.

479
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:18,950
It was the Third Cavalry's.

480
01:10:20,229 --> 01:10:22,697
Baker has nothing...

481
01:10:23,132 --> 01:10:27,091
The gold... I hid the gold.
The gold is safe.

482
01:10:28,004 --> 01:10:31,235
Where?
Where, here? Here?

483
01:10:31,307 --> 01:10:32,535
Talk.

484
01:10:32,608 --> 01:10:35,304
The... cemetery.

485
01:10:35,378 --> 01:10:37,039
Which cemetery?

486
01:10:37,113 --> 01:10:40,480
The one... on Sad Hill.

487
01:10:41,017 --> 01:10:43,281
There's a grave by...

488
01:10:43,352 --> 01:10:47,846
Which grave?
Have a name? Have a number?

489
01:10:47,924 --> 01:10:50,722
Come on, you dummy, talk!

490
01:10:52,028 --> 01:10:54,292
There's no number.

491
01:10:54,363 --> 01:10:55,694
There's a name.

492
01:10:57,199 --> 01:11:00,100
- It's written...
- It is?

493
01:11:06,175 --> 01:11:07,608
Water...

494
01:11:09,979 --> 01:11:12,914
You talk first.
I'll give you water later.

495
01:11:12,982 --> 01:11:14,677
Sad Hill Cemetery. Okay.

496
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:16,115
In the grave. Okay.

497
01:11:16,185 --> 01:11:18,745
But it must have a name
or a number on it!

498
01:11:18,821 --> 01:11:21,449
There must be a thousand...
five thousand!

499
01:11:22,091 --> 01:11:24,082
Water...

500
01:11:25,628 --> 01:11:27,562
Don't die.

501
01:11:27,630 --> 01:11:29,791
Don't die.
I'll get you water.

502
01:11:29,865 --> 01:11:31,355
Stay there.

503
01:11:31,434 --> 01:11:33,527
Don't move.
I'll get you water.

504
01:11:33,603 --> 01:11:36,834
Don't die until later,
you son of a...

505
01:12:01,597 --> 01:12:02,928
Get away from there!

506
01:12:09,338 --> 01:12:12,398
- He's dead.
- Yeah.

507
01:12:14,577 --> 01:12:16,602
I'll kill you.

508
01:12:19,048 --> 01:12:23,212
If you do that,
you 'll always be poor...

509
01:12:23,285 --> 01:12:26,413
just like the greasy rat
that you are.

510
01:12:27,056 --> 01:12:31,186
If I were you,
I'd keep me alive.

511
01:12:31,260 --> 01:12:32,955
What did he tell you?

512
01:12:34,830 --> 01:12:36,422
A name.

513
01:12:36,999 --> 01:12:39,092
A name on a grave.

514
01:12:39,168 --> 01:12:41,261
What name?

515
01:12:54,684 --> 01:12:56,652
Blondie, don't die.

516
01:12:56,819 --> 01:12:58,787
Blondie, don't die.

517
01:12:58,854 --> 01:13:01,550
I'm your friend.
Please don't die! Please!

518
01:13:01,624 --> 01:13:04,354
I'm your friend.
Come on.

519
01:13:04,427 --> 01:13:05,917
Come on!

520
01:13:05,995 --> 01:13:09,522
Blondie? I'll help you.
I'll help you.

521
01:13:09,598 --> 01:13:12,624
Don't move. I'll be right back.
I'll get the water.

522
01:13:12,702 --> 01:13:14,602
Don't die like that pig.

523
01:13:14,670 --> 01:13:17,434
Here, Blondie.
Here's water.

524
01:13:17,506 --> 01:13:18,666
Water, Blondie.

525
01:13:18,741 --> 01:13:20,572
Don't drink!
It's no good for you.

526
01:13:20,643 --> 01:13:22,270
Feel better?

527
01:13:22,344 --> 01:13:24,505
Blondie, what's the matter?

528
01:13:24,580 --> 01:13:26,946
Please don't die!

529
01:13:35,124 --> 01:13:38,423
Hey, open up.
Open up! Hurry.

530
01:13:38,494 --> 01:13:41,657
Settle down, settle down.
Who's there?

531
01:13:42,865 --> 01:13:46,631
What do you mean?
You think I'm the enemy?

532
01:13:49,572 --> 01:13:53,338
If I were a Yankee, you wouldn't
have time to ask me that.

533
01:13:53,409 --> 01:13:54,706
Come on.

534
01:13:54,777 --> 01:13:57,473
Sergeant, listen to this
corporal for a moment.

535
01:13:57,546 --> 01:13:58,672
Yes, sir.

536
01:13:58,748 --> 01:14:01,740
Sergeant, I have a gravely
wounded man here,

537
01:14:01,817 --> 01:14:04,445
if he's not dead already.

538
01:14:05,621 --> 01:14:06,986
He's still alive?

539
01:14:07,056 --> 01:14:09,923
Well, he seems to be.

540
01:14:09,992 --> 01:14:12,119
- What happened?
- It was a trap.

541
01:14:12,194 --> 01:14:13,684
Only the two of us got away.

542
01:14:13,763 --> 01:14:15,993
Name and traveling papers.

543
01:14:17,967 --> 01:14:19,867
Here. Corporal Bill Carson,

544
01:14:19,935 --> 01:14:22,199
Third Regiment,
Second Cavalry Squadron,

545
01:14:22,271 --> 01:14:25,172
arriving from San Rafael.
Is that enough?

546
01:14:30,446 --> 01:14:32,971
You 're reading
while this man is dying.

547
01:14:33,048 --> 01:14:37,144
Corporal, we're trying to withdraw
and you 're looking for an infirmary?

548
01:14:37,219 --> 01:14:41,087
If you want one, you 'll have to
make yourself a Yankee prisoner.

549
01:14:41,724 --> 01:14:45,353
- So where are we?
- Near Apache Canyon.

550
01:14:46,562 --> 01:14:49,087
- Apache Canyon?
- Apache Canyon.

551
01:14:49,165 --> 01:14:51,690
Is the Mission San Antonio
around here?

552
01:14:51,767 --> 01:14:53,962
Sure, 18 miles south.
Take him there.

553
01:14:54,036 --> 01:14:57,733
The brothers take care
of anyone who's wounded.

554
01:14:57,807 --> 01:15:00,503
Keep your eyes open.
The area's full of Yankees.

555
01:15:00,576 --> 01:15:03,170
- Thank you. Good-bye, Sergeant.
- Take care.

556
01:15:28,537 --> 01:15:30,027
Got a very sick man here.

557
01:15:30,105 --> 01:15:33,302
- But we have no more beds.
- Let him have yours.

558
01:15:39,048 --> 01:15:41,175
- Where's Pablo Ramirez?
- Father Ramirez.

559
01:15:41,250 --> 01:15:45,710
He is away at the moment.
He should be back any day now.

560
01:15:45,788 --> 01:15:47,255
Well, it doesn't matter.

561
01:15:47,323 --> 01:15:50,190
For the moment, we take
very good care of my friend.

562
01:15:50,259 --> 01:15:51,954
And may God be praised.

563
01:15:52,027 --> 01:15:56,259
God is on our side, too,
because he hates the Yankees.

564
01:15:56,332 --> 01:15:57,856
Huh, Blondie?

565
01:15:58,767 --> 01:16:02,203
- Father, is he still breathing?
- Yes, of course.

566
01:16:02,705 --> 01:16:03,763
You 're heavy.

567
01:16:46,749 --> 01:16:49,877
All right.
Put a fresh bandage on him.

568
01:16:50,853 --> 01:16:52,684
Put him in my cell.

569
01:16:53,522 --> 01:16:54,955
Easy!

570
01:16:58,093 --> 01:17:00,459
Out, soldier.
Come on.

571
01:17:00,529 --> 01:17:03,123
Look after him, please.
He's like a brother to me.

572
01:17:09,004 --> 01:17:11,063
Hey, Father...

573
01:17:23,085 --> 01:17:25,747
Father, did he speak?
Did he say anything?

574
01:17:56,852 --> 01:17:59,377
Father, did he ask for me?
Did he speak, Father?

575
01:17:59,455 --> 01:18:01,184
No, he hasn't spoken as yet.

576
01:18:01,256 --> 01:18:04,089
You mustn't worry.
He's both young and strong.

577
01:18:04,159 --> 01:18:06,525
That's what's
kept him going until now.

578
01:18:06,595 --> 01:18:09,189
He should regain his strength
in a very short time.

579
01:18:09,264 --> 01:18:11,698
You don't know how much
this boy's life means to me.

580
01:18:11,767 --> 01:18:14,361
Thanks be to Jesus.
Thanks to all of you.

581
01:19:03,318 --> 01:19:04,615
Blondie?

582
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:12,725
Blondie?

583
01:19:32,247 --> 01:19:35,978
The old father tells me you 'll be
up and around in a few days.

584
01:19:36,051 --> 01:19:39,646
You 're very lucky to have me
so close when it happened.

585
01:19:39,721 --> 01:19:42,053
Think if you 'd been
on your own.

586
01:19:44,059 --> 01:19:48,928
I mean when one is ill,

587
01:19:48,997 --> 01:19:51,397
it's good to have
somebody close by...

588
01:19:51,467 --> 01:19:54,368
friends or relations.

589
01:19:54,436 --> 01:19:58,702
Do you have parents, Blondie?

590
01:19:58,774 --> 01:19:59,934
A mother?

591
01:20:00,008 --> 01:20:02,340
Not even a mother.

592
01:20:03,011 --> 01:20:04,808
No one.

593
01:20:05,547 --> 01:20:09,074
You 're all alone, huh?
Like me, Blondie.

594
01:20:09,151 --> 01:20:11,278
We're all alone in the world.

595
01:20:12,054 --> 01:20:14,545
I have you.
You have me.

596
01:20:16,959 --> 01:20:18,824
Only for a little while, I mean.

597
01:20:19,428 --> 01:20:21,328
It had to happen now.

598
01:20:22,297 --> 01:20:24,629
What a dirty, rotten trick of fate.

599
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:28,727
We could have all that money
in our hands now.

600
01:20:32,975 --> 01:20:36,809
I must tell you
the truth, Blondie.

601
01:20:36,879 --> 01:20:39,780
In my place, you would
do the same thing.

602
01:20:41,250 --> 01:20:43,810
It's all over for you now.

603
01:20:44,286 --> 01:20:47,380
There's nothing
anyone can do anymore.

604
01:20:49,625 --> 01:20:51,525
Oh, God, look at me.

605
01:20:51,593 --> 01:20:54,756
It's my fault.
Mine. Mine. Mine. Mine.

606
01:21:05,641 --> 01:21:08,041
I'll tell you one thing, Blondie.

607
01:21:08,110 --> 01:21:11,739
If I knew that
my last hour had come, I swear,

608
01:21:11,813 --> 01:21:15,442
in my place... in your place,
I would do the same thing.

609
01:21:15,984 --> 01:21:19,476
I would tell about the gold.
Yes. Yes, I would.

610
01:21:19,555 --> 01:21:22,115
I'd tell the name on the grave.

611
01:21:22,191 --> 01:21:24,819
What good is the money
to you if you 're dead?

612
01:21:24,893 --> 01:21:26,793
I know the name
of the cemetery,

613
01:21:26,862 --> 01:21:30,127
but you know how many graves
there are there?

614
01:21:30,199 --> 01:21:31,564
Please...

615
01:21:32,467 --> 01:21:35,436
Blondie, please, have a little.

616
01:21:35,504 --> 01:21:36,664
Here.

617
01:21:38,807 --> 01:21:41,970
Coffee.
Please, tell me the name...

618
01:21:43,845 --> 01:21:45,642
On the grave.

619
01:21:46,348 --> 01:21:50,842
If I get my hands
on the $200,000,

620
01:21:50,919 --> 01:21:53,285
I'll always honor your memory.

621
01:21:53,956 --> 01:21:57,790
I swear.
I'll always honor your memory.

622
01:22:00,329 --> 01:22:02,297
Come... closer.

623
01:22:07,402 --> 01:22:08,801
Tell me.

624
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:12,300
You dirty...

625
01:22:14,843 --> 01:22:17,437
I'll sleep better

626
01:22:17,512 --> 01:22:21,949
knowing my good friend
is by my side

627
01:22:22,017 --> 01:22:24,383
to protect me.

628
01:22:32,995 --> 01:22:35,293
''Tuco, water.''
Well, here's water.

629
01:22:35,364 --> 01:22:39,232
But if I get that name from you,
I'll give you water.

630
01:22:46,141 --> 01:22:49,008
All right, you dirty skunk,
get your ass off the bed.

631
01:22:49,077 --> 01:22:51,136
Come on, come on,
the party's over.

632
01:22:51,213 --> 01:22:53,340
The wagon is all ready to go.

633
01:22:53,415 --> 01:22:55,315
The way the wounded
are pouring in,

634
01:22:55,384 --> 01:22:58,615
we'd better get out of here
before we get caught up in the war.

635
01:22:58,687 --> 01:23:01,087
Tuco, Father Ramirez is back.

636
01:23:01,857 --> 01:23:04,348
This is something
I have to look into.

637
01:23:04,426 --> 01:23:05,586
Get moving.

638
01:23:06,428 --> 01:23:08,453
- Where? This way?
- Yes.

639
01:23:25,414 --> 01:23:26,574
Hey, Pablo?

640
01:23:35,223 --> 01:23:37,418
Don't you recognize me?

641
01:23:39,061 --> 01:23:42,462
It's me! It's Tuco!
Let me embrace you!

642
01:23:46,702 --> 01:23:49,466
I don't know the right thing.

643
01:23:53,875 --> 01:23:56,366
I was passing by here.
I said to myself,

644
01:23:56,445 --> 01:23:58,538
''I wonder if my brother
remembers his brother.''

645
01:24:02,451 --> 01:24:03,782
Did I do wrong?

646
01:24:05,253 --> 01:24:08,222
It doesn't matter.
I'm very happy.

647
01:24:08,290 --> 01:24:10,554
You 've seen me, Tuco.

648
01:24:12,561 --> 01:24:15,428
Yeah, well,
I'm very glad I came.

649
01:24:21,236 --> 01:24:22,999
My uniform!

650
01:24:23,071 --> 01:24:25,198
It's a long story.

651
01:24:25,273 --> 01:24:28,674
But let's talk about you.
It's more important.

652
01:24:28,744 --> 01:24:30,405
You look very well.

653
01:24:31,346 --> 01:24:33,337
A bit thin, perhaps.

654
01:24:35,183 --> 01:24:37,674
You were always thin,
eh, Pablito?

655
01:24:39,888 --> 01:24:42,948
What about our parents?

656
01:24:44,393 --> 01:24:46,759
Only now do you think of them.

657
01:24:47,629 --> 01:24:50,427
To begin after nine years.

658
01:24:52,067 --> 01:24:53,898
Nine years?

659
01:24:55,036 --> 01:24:57,163
So it's nine years.

660
01:24:57,839 --> 01:24:59,500
Nine years!

661
01:24:59,574 --> 01:25:03,032
Our mother has been dead
a long time now.

662
01:25:04,479 --> 01:25:07,107
Our father died
only a few days ago.

663
01:25:07,716 --> 01:25:10,014
That's why I was away.

664
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:13,886
He asked for you to be there.

665
01:25:13,955 --> 01:25:16,082
But there was only me.

666
01:25:23,064 --> 01:25:24,588
And you?

667
01:25:25,300 --> 01:25:28,326
Outside of evil,
what else have you managed to do?

668
01:25:29,738 --> 01:25:32,730
It seems to me
you once had a wife someplace.

669
01:25:35,811 --> 01:25:37,642
Not one. Lots of them.

670
01:25:37,712 --> 01:25:40,408
One here, one there,
wherever I found them.

671
01:25:41,817 --> 01:25:44,547
Go on. Preach me
a sermon, Pablo.

672
01:25:46,288 --> 01:25:48,381
What good would that be?

673
01:25:49,658 --> 01:25:51,990
Just keep on the way you 're going.

674
01:25:52,060 --> 01:25:54,028
Go away.

675
01:25:55,030 --> 01:25:57,021
And the Lord have mercy
on your soul.

676
01:25:57,098 --> 01:26:00,397
I'll go. And while I'm waiting
for the Lord to remember me,

677
01:26:00,469 --> 01:26:03,700
I, Tuco Ramirez,
brother of Brother Ramirez,

678
01:26:03,772 --> 01:26:05,967
will tell you something.

679
01:26:06,041 --> 01:26:08,236
You think you 're better than I am.

680
01:26:08,310 --> 01:26:10,938
Where we came from, if one
did not want to die of poverty,

681
01:26:11,012 --> 01:26:13,276
one became a priest
or a bandit.

682
01:26:13,348 --> 01:26:15,942
You chose your way,
I chose mine.

683
01:26:16,017 --> 01:26:17,848
Mine was harder!

684
01:26:17,919 --> 01:26:20,114
You talk about
Mother and Father.

685
01:26:20,188 --> 01:26:22,986
When you left to become
a priest, I stayed behind.

686
01:26:23,058 --> 01:26:27,358
I must have been 10, 12... I don't
remember which... but I stayed.

687
01:26:27,429 --> 01:26:29,420
I tried, but it was no good.

688
01:26:29,498 --> 01:26:31,398
Now I'm gonna tell you something.

689
01:26:31,466 --> 01:26:34,560
You became a priest because
you were too much of a coward

690
01:26:34,636 --> 01:26:36,399
to do what I do.

691
01:26:54,456 --> 01:26:55,445
Tuco.

692
01:27:07,168 --> 01:27:09,329
Please forgive me, Brother.

693
01:27:38,833 --> 01:27:40,960
My belly's full.

694
01:27:42,404 --> 01:27:44,770
Nice guy, my brother.

695
01:27:44,839 --> 01:27:47,137
I didn't tell you
my brother was in charge here?

696
01:27:47,208 --> 01:27:49,472
Everything.
Like the pope almost.

697
01:27:49,544 --> 01:27:51,273
He's in charge in Rome.

698
01:27:51,346 --> 01:27:55,077
My brother, he say to me,
''Stay, Brother. Don't go home.

699
01:27:55,150 --> 01:27:56,811
''We never see each other.

700
01:27:56,885 --> 01:27:58,750
''Here there's plenty
to eat and drink.

701
01:27:58,820 --> 01:28:00,685
Bring your friend, too.''

702
01:28:01,590 --> 01:28:05,321
Whenever we see each other,
he never lets me go.

703
01:28:06,561 --> 01:28:09,689
My brother,
he is crazy about me.

704
01:28:12,867 --> 01:28:15,495
That's so.
Even a tramp like me,

705
01:28:15,570 --> 01:28:19,631
no matter what happens,
I know there's a brother somewhere

706
01:28:19,708 --> 01:28:23,235
who will never refuse me
a bowl of soup.

707
01:28:24,846 --> 01:28:26,473
Sure.

708
01:28:27,749 --> 01:28:31,583
Well, after a meal,
there's nothing like a good cigar.

709
01:29:22,070 --> 01:29:25,130
Here's the Sierra Magdalena.

710
01:29:25,206 --> 01:29:28,141
Going this way,
we'll cross the Rio Grande.

711
01:29:28,209 --> 01:29:31,144
That sure is a long way.

712
01:29:31,780 --> 01:29:35,716
Here to the northwest,
through all of Texas.

713
01:29:36,651 --> 01:29:38,209
- After that...
- Then what?

714
01:29:40,188 --> 01:29:43,521
Then we get there.
You 're not worried, are you?

715
01:29:47,095 --> 01:29:49,791
Those men aren't worried about
anything anymore, are they?

716
01:29:53,368 --> 01:29:55,359
But since I'm alive
and I've noticed

717
01:29:55,437 --> 01:29:59,533
we'll be crossing Yankee
and Confederate lines a few times,

718
01:29:59,607 --> 01:30:02,735
I thought you might tell me
where we're going.

719
01:30:02,811 --> 01:30:06,907
Towards $200,000.
Is that good enough for you?

720
01:30:16,725 --> 01:30:18,352
Look.

721
01:30:25,734 --> 01:30:28,168
Hey, wake up, you.

722
01:30:28,236 --> 01:30:31,399
- There are troops coming.
- Blue or gray?

723
01:30:38,413 --> 01:30:41,780
They're gray like us.
Let's say hello, then get going.

724
01:30:43,718 --> 01:30:46,346
Hoorah for the Confederacy!

725
01:30:47,222 --> 01:30:49,349
Down with General Grant!

726
01:30:49,424 --> 01:30:51,984
Hoorah for General...
What's his name?

727
01:30:52,060 --> 01:30:53,960
- Lee.
- Lee. Lee!

728
01:30:55,430 --> 01:30:58,126
God is with us
because he hates the Yanks, too!

729
01:31:00,401 --> 01:31:04,064
God's not on our side,
'cause he hates idiots also.

730
01:31:15,850 --> 01:31:20,446
Hup, 2, 3, 4.
Hup, 2, 3, 4...

731
01:31:24,325 --> 01:31:29,695
Prisoners of war,
forward! March!

732
01:31:30,532 --> 01:31:32,523
Hup, 2, 3, 4...

733
01:32:22,250 --> 01:32:23,581
Halt!

734
01:32:26,988 --> 01:32:29,479
Left... face!

735
01:32:32,493 --> 01:32:36,054
Form a single file. Move!

736
01:33:17,872 --> 01:33:20,466
- Jonathan Ross.
- Present.

737
01:33:27,315 --> 01:33:30,182
- Richard Bouvier.
- Present.

738
01:33:30,251 --> 01:33:33,948
- Nathaniel Solomon.
- Present.

739
01:33:34,022 --> 01:33:35,819
Robert Clark.

740
01:33:35,890 --> 01:33:37,448
Present.

741
01:33:38,226 --> 01:33:41,218
- Sam Richman.
- Present.

742
01:33:44,132 --> 01:33:45,326
Bill Carson.

743
01:33:48,937 --> 01:33:50,928
Bill Carson?

744
01:33:51,839 --> 01:33:54,239
I said Bill Carson!

745
01:33:54,309 --> 01:33:57,335
Hey, Blondie,
isn't that Angel Eyes?

746
01:33:58,012 --> 01:34:01,106
All right,
what's he doing... sleeping?

747
01:34:02,016 --> 01:34:04,041
Bill Carson!

748
01:34:04,118 --> 01:34:07,178
Yeah. And you 'd better
be Bill Carson.

749
01:34:07,255 --> 01:34:08,950
Bill Carson!

750
01:34:09,023 --> 01:34:11,924
Yeah, that's me.

751
01:34:20,201 --> 01:34:21,964
Please, Carson...

752
01:34:23,438 --> 01:34:25,235
Answer ''present.''

753
01:34:26,541 --> 01:34:27,872
What are you, deaf?

754
01:34:34,682 --> 01:34:37,048
Suppose you say ''present,'' Carson.

755
01:34:39,053 --> 01:34:42,250
I like big fat men like you.

756
01:34:42,323 --> 01:34:44,188
When they fall,
they make more noise.

757
01:34:44,258 --> 01:34:47,352
And sometimes
they never get up.

758
01:34:48,129 --> 01:34:49,596
Wallace...

759
01:34:51,165 --> 01:34:52,860
That's enough.

760
01:34:55,737 --> 01:34:56,965
Sergeant!

761
01:34:58,973 --> 01:35:01,134
The captain wants
to see you right away.

762
01:35:04,879 --> 01:35:07,609
Be sure these two
get good treatment.

763
01:35:17,592 --> 01:35:21,619
Blondie, did you hear that?
Good treatment.

764
01:35:23,731 --> 01:35:25,392
Yeah.

765
01:35:28,536 --> 01:35:31,027
For the last time, Sergeant,

766
01:35:31,105 --> 01:35:35,974
I'm telling you I want
the prisoners treated as prisoners.

767
01:35:36,044 --> 01:35:38,239
No more brutality.

768
01:35:38,846 --> 01:35:42,509
There's hundreds of prisoners
and only a few men to guard them.

769
01:35:42,583 --> 01:35:44,949
What am I supposed to do?
I have to have respect.

770
01:35:45,019 --> 01:35:50,013
I think you 'll manage to gain their
respect by treating them better.

771
01:35:51,325 --> 01:35:53,919
Are our men treated that well
in Andersonville Camp?

772
01:35:53,995 --> 01:35:56,828
I don't give a goddamn
what they do in Andersonville.

773
01:35:56,898 --> 01:36:00,425
While I'm in charge,
the prisoners are not to be tortured

774
01:36:00,501 --> 01:36:02,298
or cheated...

775
01:36:02,370 --> 01:36:03,632
or murdered.

776
01:36:04,172 --> 01:36:06,231
That an accusation?

777
01:36:06,307 --> 01:36:10,209
Sergeant, gangrene
is eating my leg away,

778
01:36:12,046 --> 01:36:15,209
I know the prisoners here
are being robbed systematically.

779
01:36:15,283 --> 01:36:18,684
I know there's scum around
who are bivouacked near the camp,

780
01:36:18,753 --> 01:36:21,984
waiting for someone
to deliver this loot.

781
01:36:22,056 --> 01:36:25,753
But as long as I'm commandant,
I won't permit any such trickery.

782
01:36:25,827 --> 01:36:27,055
Am I clear?

783
01:36:29,363 --> 01:36:30,694
Yes, sir...

784
01:36:30,765 --> 01:36:33,359
Just as long
as you 're the commandant.

785
01:36:34,869 --> 01:36:36,860
Yes, Sergeant.

786
01:36:39,340 --> 01:36:42,798
I know this leg means
I won't last very long,

787
01:36:42,877 --> 01:36:45,607
but I pray I can manage
to have enough time

788
01:36:45,680 --> 01:36:49,776
to amass evidence
and bring to a court-martial

789
01:36:49,851 --> 01:36:52,513
all those
who discredit and dishonor

790
01:36:52,587 --> 01:36:55,886
the uniform of the Union.

791
01:37:00,194 --> 01:37:02,628
I wish you luck.

792
01:37:36,664 --> 01:37:40,031
You and the others
better lay low for a few days.

793
01:37:40,868 --> 01:37:44,531
No, I'll keep this. You go.
Wallace will let you know.

794
01:37:55,316 --> 01:37:57,750
Wallace, bring me Carson.

795
01:37:57,818 --> 01:37:59,615
Right.

796
01:38:12,967 --> 01:38:16,960
Listen, Angel Eyes said
for us to lay low for a few days.

797
01:38:17,038 --> 01:38:20,496
But we'll keep close enough
to keep an eye on things.

798
01:38:20,575 --> 01:38:22,634
Come on,
saddle your horses.

799
01:38:22,743 --> 01:38:24,472
Get in.

800
01:38:33,287 --> 01:38:36,415
Come on in, Tuco.
Don't be bashful.

801
01:38:37,658 --> 01:38:39,785
There's no formalities here.

802
01:38:51,239 --> 01:38:53,104
It's been a long time.

803
01:38:56,677 --> 01:38:58,235
You 're hungry.

804
01:38:58,946 --> 01:39:00,208
Sit down. Eat.

805
01:39:20,301 --> 01:39:22,462
I knew it, I knew it.

806
01:39:23,671 --> 01:39:26,105
The minute I saw you,
I said to myself...

807
01:39:27,074 --> 01:39:29,907
''Look at that pig Angel Eyes.

808
01:39:30,945 --> 01:39:33,413
''I'll bet he got himself
an easy job.

809
01:39:36,717 --> 01:39:38,912
And he never forgets a friend.''

810
01:39:39,587 --> 01:39:42,351
I never forget old friends, Tuco.

811
01:39:44,325 --> 01:39:45,758
Right.

812
01:39:45,826 --> 01:39:48,351
It's good to see
old friends again.

813
01:39:49,297 --> 01:39:50,787
Good.

814
01:39:50,865 --> 01:39:54,198
Especially when they've come
from so far away.

815
01:39:54,268 --> 01:39:56,702
You have so much to talk about.

816
01:39:58,306 --> 01:40:01,207
And you do have a lot
to talk about, haven't you?

817
01:40:03,577 --> 01:40:06,910
You were captured near Fort Craig.

818
01:40:11,519 --> 01:40:13,680
Well, if you were with Sibley,
that means then

819
01:40:13,754 --> 01:40:16,052
that you were coming
from Santa Fe.

820
01:40:29,603 --> 01:40:31,901
Was it hard crossing the desert?

821
01:40:31,972 --> 01:40:33,701
Very hard.

822
01:40:35,142 --> 01:40:38,441
Especially if you don't
have anything to drink.

823
01:40:40,414 --> 01:40:43,212
Why are you going
under the name of Bill Carson now?

824
01:40:48,989 --> 01:40:51,822
One name
is as good as another.

825
01:40:54,829 --> 01:40:55,989
Like you!

826
01:40:56,063 --> 01:40:59,294
I'll bet they don't
call you Angel Eyes.

827
01:40:59,367 --> 01:41:01,562
Sergeant Angel Eyes!

828
01:41:10,277 --> 01:41:13,303
Like a little music
with your meal, Tuco?

829
01:41:13,381 --> 01:41:14,905
Music?

830
01:41:14,982 --> 01:41:18,315
Yes, it's very good.
Very good for the digestion.

831
01:41:31,198 --> 01:41:32,597
So...

832
01:41:33,634 --> 01:41:36,398
Bill Carson's a fake name, huh?

833
01:41:41,675 --> 01:41:43,006
That fake, too?

834
01:41:45,079 --> 01:41:47,843
Bill Carson's name's
written on it.

835
01:41:49,283 --> 01:41:50,716
Have some.

836
01:41:51,318 --> 01:41:53,878
It's Bill Carson's tobacco.

837
01:43:17,071 --> 01:43:19,198
Was Carson dead or alive
when you found him?

838
01:43:26,347 --> 01:43:28,713
What'd he tell you
about the money?

839
01:43:32,620 --> 01:43:35,248
I don't know
what you 're talking about.

840
01:43:52,840 --> 01:43:54,501
More feeling.

841
01:44:12,927 --> 01:44:16,590
You can sure consider yourself
much luckier than your pal.

842
01:44:16,664 --> 01:44:19,565
Wallace will punch your friend
as long as the song goes.

843
01:44:19,633 --> 01:44:22,158
So many of us
have had a session in there.

844
01:44:43,857 --> 01:44:46,052
How's your digestion now?

845
01:44:50,030 --> 01:44:51,930
You 'd better talk.

846
01:44:51,999 --> 01:44:54,661
I have nothing to tell you.

847
01:45:21,729 --> 01:45:23,060
Play that fiddle, you.

848
01:46:08,175 --> 01:46:10,268
I talk.

849
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:22,616
What did he say
about the money?

850
01:46:26,193 --> 01:46:29,287
It's buried in a grave.

851
01:46:29,930 --> 01:46:31,022
Where?

852
01:46:31,098 --> 01:46:35,558
Sad Hill Cemetery.

853
01:46:38,272 --> 01:46:39,739
Which grave?

854
01:46:40,374 --> 01:46:42,535
I don't know.

855
01:46:42,609 --> 01:46:44,236
I don't know, I tell you.

856
01:46:45,846 --> 01:46:47,108
Blondie...

857
01:46:47,181 --> 01:46:50,048
Ask Blondie.

858
01:46:50,117 --> 01:46:52,677
He knows
the name on the grave.

859
01:46:53,921 --> 01:46:55,479
Blondie...

860
01:47:09,470 --> 01:47:11,301
The war's over for you.

861
01:47:14,475 --> 01:47:16,500
Put those clothes on.

862
01:47:20,714 --> 01:47:22,375
Why?

863
01:47:22,449 --> 01:47:24,314
We're going for a ride.

864
01:47:25,486 --> 01:47:27,249
Where?

865
01:47:27,321 --> 01:47:29,414
To find $200,000.

866
01:47:29,990 --> 01:47:32,857
I know the name
of the cemetery now.

867
01:47:32,926 --> 01:47:36,020
And you know
the name of the grave.

868
01:47:55,549 --> 01:47:58,746
You 're not going to give me
the same treatment?

869
01:48:02,289 --> 01:48:04,154
Would you talk?

870
01:48:05,092 --> 01:48:06,719
No, probably not.

871
01:48:08,629 --> 01:48:11,120
That's what I thought.

872
01:48:11,198 --> 01:48:13,223
Not that you 're
any tougher than Tuco,

873
01:48:13,300 --> 01:48:16,997
but you 're smart enough
to know that talking won't save you.

874
01:48:20,374 --> 01:48:22,399
And Tuco...

875
01:48:22,476 --> 01:48:23,909
Is he...

876
01:48:25,813 --> 01:48:28,338
No. Not yet.

877
01:48:29,082 --> 01:48:31,744
But he's in very good hands.

878
01:48:32,653 --> 01:48:35,850
You 've changed partners,
but you still got the same deal.

879
01:48:35,923 --> 01:48:38,585
I'm not greedy.
I'm only taking half.

880
01:48:39,860 --> 01:48:41,452
There's two of us.

881
01:48:41,528 --> 01:48:43,894
It should make it easier
than just one.

882
01:48:48,635 --> 01:48:49,966
Yeah.

883
01:49:09,990 --> 01:49:11,389
Hold it.

884
01:49:11,458 --> 01:49:14,188
That's it. Don't move.

885
01:49:14,261 --> 01:49:16,286
Now don't breathe.

886
01:49:16,363 --> 01:49:18,695
Still... That's it.

887
01:49:20,100 --> 01:49:22,625
Got it. Thank you.

888
01:49:37,951 --> 01:49:41,717
Hey, Corporal, afraid he'll get lost?
Where's the rebel going?

889
01:49:41,788 --> 01:49:43,983
To hell, with a rope around his neck
and a price on his head.

890
01:49:44,057 --> 01:49:47,220
Yeah. $3,000, friend.

891
01:49:47,294 --> 01:49:49,387
That's a lot of money
for a head.

892
01:49:50,631 --> 01:49:53,794
I'll bet they didn't even
pay you a penny for your arm.

893
01:49:59,907 --> 01:50:03,308
I told you once, friend,
if I ever get you down,

894
01:50:03,377 --> 01:50:05,538
you 're gonna need a lot
of help to get up again.

895
01:50:26,300 --> 01:50:28,700
You 're a lot luckier
than that one there.

896
01:50:28,769 --> 01:50:31,169
You 'll get some grub, a rope,
and you 're all finished.

897
01:50:31,238 --> 01:50:34,469
And there isn't any partner
this time to shoot you down.

898
01:50:58,999 --> 01:51:00,489
Get up.

899
01:52:16,343 --> 01:52:18,777
If your friends
stay out in the damp,

900
01:52:18,845 --> 01:52:21,313
they're liable to catch a cold,
aren't they?

901
01:52:21,381 --> 01:52:22,848
Or a bullet.

902
01:52:27,888 --> 01:52:30,482
Hear that, boys?
Come on out here.

903
01:52:42,436 --> 01:52:44,427
Since we're all going
in the same direction,

904
01:52:44,504 --> 01:52:46,062
might as well go together.

905
01:52:47,741 --> 01:52:49,902
One... two...

906
01:52:49,976 --> 01:52:51,967
three... four...

907
01:52:52,045 --> 01:52:54,878
five... six.

908
01:52:55,582 --> 01:52:58,517
Six. Perfect number.

909
01:52:59,719 --> 01:53:01,983
Isn't three the perfect number?

910
01:53:03,924 --> 01:53:07,382
Yeah, but I got
six more bullets in my gun.

911
01:54:10,690 --> 01:54:13,523
Sure would like to put
your paw on it, huh?

912
01:54:15,595 --> 01:54:17,688
I would like to piss.
It's rough.

913
01:54:17,764 --> 01:54:20,232
I've been shaken up
on this train nearly ten hours now.

914
01:54:20,300 --> 01:54:22,996
You smell like a pig already,

915
01:54:23,069 --> 01:54:26,038
but let's try not
to make things any worse.

916
01:54:28,208 --> 01:54:30,233
Get going.

917
01:54:38,718 --> 01:54:41,278
I can't while you 're watching me.

918
01:55:04,711 --> 01:55:07,236
You made a lot of noise,
my friend.

919
01:55:28,468 --> 01:55:30,402
You don't want to break
our friendship?

920
01:55:30,503 --> 01:55:32,300
Well, I'll break it.

921
01:57:16,876 --> 01:57:18,605
Halt.

922
01:57:19,846 --> 01:57:21,814
Take your places.

923
01:57:32,959 --> 01:57:34,358
Ready.

924
01:57:34,961 --> 01:57:36,189
Aim.

925
01:57:36,262 --> 01:57:37,524
Fire!

926
01:57:54,414 --> 01:57:56,939
Clem, take care of the horses.

927
02:02:12,972 --> 02:02:15,736
I been looking for you
for eight months.

928
02:02:16,442 --> 02:02:19,605
Whenever I should've had
a gun in my right hand...

929
02:02:19,679 --> 02:02:21,237
I thought of you.

930
02:02:21,314 --> 02:02:25,375
Now I find you in exactly
the position that suits me.

931
02:02:25,451 --> 02:02:29,820
I had lots of time to learn
how to shoot with my left.

932
02:02:45,071 --> 02:02:47,972
When you have to shoot, shoot.
Don't talk.

933
02:02:51,210 --> 02:02:54,202
Every gun makes its own tune.

934
02:02:54,814 --> 02:02:57,282
And it's perfect timing,
large one.

935
02:03:15,034 --> 02:03:17,468
Clem, follow him.

936
02:04:14,427 --> 02:04:17,487
Just a minute.
I'll be right there.

937
02:04:17,563 --> 02:04:21,363
Just give me time
to get dressed, and I'll open up.

938
02:04:41,554 --> 02:04:44,148
Put your drawers on
and take your gun off.

939
02:04:55,635 --> 02:04:57,262
Hey, Blondie,

940
02:04:57,336 --> 02:05:00,032
how the hell did you
get out of that pigsty?

941
02:05:02,675 --> 02:05:05,940
I'm here with your
old friend Angel Eyes.

942
02:05:06,612 --> 02:05:09,843
You talked, you traitor.
You talked.

943
02:05:09,916 --> 02:05:12,407
No, I didn't talk.

944
02:05:12,485 --> 02:05:15,249
If I did, I probably
wouldn't be here now.

945
02:05:16,422 --> 02:05:19,255
You... mean...

946
02:05:19,325 --> 02:05:22,123
So only you know
your half of the secret?

947
02:05:27,366 --> 02:05:28,833
Blondie!

948
02:05:28,901 --> 02:05:31,369
I'm very happy
you 're working with me

949
02:05:31,437 --> 02:05:33,462
and we're together again.

950
02:05:33,539 --> 02:05:35,803
I get dressed,
I kill him, be right back.

951
02:05:35,875 --> 02:05:37,342
Listen...

952
02:05:37,410 --> 02:05:39,742
I forgot to mention...

953
02:05:41,981 --> 02:05:44,472
He's not alone.
There's five of them.

954
02:05:46,185 --> 02:05:47,345
Five?

955
02:05:47,420 --> 02:05:49,752
Yeah, five of them.

956
02:05:52,058 --> 02:05:54,754
So that's why you came to Tuco?

957
02:05:57,730 --> 02:06:00,597
It doesn't matter.
I'll kill them all.

958
02:06:12,144 --> 02:06:14,476
They shot him at close range.

959
02:06:33,866 --> 02:06:35,527
Well, look who's here.

960
02:06:36,102 --> 02:06:38,263
The other one will be along.

961
02:06:40,740 --> 02:06:42,833
They'll come looking for us.

962
02:06:44,477 --> 02:06:45,774
Watch out.

963
02:06:47,079 --> 02:06:48,569
There's two of them.

964
02:06:50,016 --> 02:06:52,211
I want that blond alive.

965
02:07:00,860 --> 02:07:02,589
You, back there.

966
02:07:03,095 --> 02:07:04,858
Come on, let's go.

967
02:07:38,230 --> 02:07:40,755
Were you gonna die alone?

968
02:09:31,143 --> 02:09:32,440
Halt!

969
02:09:57,536 --> 02:10:00,733
Hey, Blondie,
Angel Eyes is mine, huh?

970
02:10:00,806 --> 02:10:02,205
All right.

971
02:10:41,814 --> 02:10:45,580
''See you soon, i-idi... ''

972
02:10:46,218 --> 02:10:47,651
''ldiots.''

973
02:10:49,021 --> 02:10:50,716
It's for you.

974
02:11:15,447 --> 02:11:18,382
How peaceful and quiet, amigo.

975
02:11:18,450 --> 02:11:21,078
Like a cemetery, for instance?

976
02:11:22,254 --> 02:11:25,280
There should be a bridge
across that river.

977
02:11:25,357 --> 02:11:27,018
We'd better wait for nightfall.

978
02:11:27,092 --> 02:11:29,253
Trust in me, Blondie.

979
02:11:31,230 --> 02:11:33,858
I got a good sense
of where I'm going.

980
02:11:33,933 --> 02:11:37,096
Tuco has taken you this far.
I will take you all the way...

981
02:11:37,937 --> 02:11:39,234
Gentlemen.

982
02:11:42,875 --> 02:11:45,139
- Tell the captain.
- Yes, sir.

983
02:11:46,011 --> 02:11:48,673
Come along now.
Follow me.

984
02:12:35,361 --> 02:12:37,761
We found them near
the perimeter, sir.

985
02:12:52,111 --> 02:12:54,443
Where do you hail from?

986
02:12:54,513 --> 02:12:55,980
Illinois.

987
02:12:58,250 --> 02:13:00,241
And you?

988
02:13:00,319 --> 02:13:02,253
I'm with him.

989
02:13:08,360 --> 02:13:11,022
Any reason
for being around here?

990
02:13:11,096 --> 02:13:14,657
We want to enlist, General.

991
02:13:17,036 --> 02:13:19,561
You better learn
to distinguish rank.

992
02:13:19,638 --> 02:13:21,435
I'm a captain.

993
02:13:22,975 --> 02:13:24,704
Get the hell out.

994
02:13:26,111 --> 02:13:28,909
It sure as hell might be you today,
so go write your will.

995
02:13:28,981 --> 02:13:30,608
Yes, sir.

996
02:13:35,721 --> 02:13:38,121
So you want to enlist?

997
02:13:38,691 --> 02:13:41,717
You got to take a test
to prove it.

998
02:13:50,669 --> 02:13:52,159
Well, show me.

999
02:14:16,095 --> 02:14:17,653
You 've got a career.

1000
02:14:17,730 --> 02:14:20,563
At the least,
I'd say you 'll make colonel.

1001
02:14:20,632 --> 02:14:22,497
- Really?
- Sure.

1002
02:14:23,268 --> 02:14:25,293
Like it says in the manual,

1003
02:14:25,371 --> 02:14:27,100
''You 've got every qualification

1004
02:14:27,172 --> 02:14:30,403
to become an expert
in the use of weapons.''

1005
02:14:31,176 --> 02:14:35,408
For this, sir, is the most
potent weapon in war.

1006
02:14:37,883 --> 02:14:40,750
The fighting spirit's in this bottle.

1007
02:14:42,688 --> 02:14:44,713
Volunteers.

1008
02:14:46,258 --> 02:14:48,317
You want to enlist?

1009
02:14:49,528 --> 02:14:50,756
Let's go.

1010
02:14:50,829 --> 02:14:53,354
Come on, gentlemen,
come on.

1011
02:14:55,667 --> 02:14:58,830
The shooting hasn't begun yet.
You 're still in time.

1012
02:15:14,686 --> 02:15:17,154
Whoever has the most liquor
to get the soldiers drunk

1013
02:15:17,222 --> 02:15:21,420
and send them to be slaughtered...
he's the winner.

1014
02:15:21,493 --> 02:15:24,656
We and the ones over
on the other side of the river

1015
02:15:24,730 --> 02:15:27,290
only have one thing in common...

1016
02:15:28,133 --> 02:15:30,567
All of us reek of alcohol.

1017
02:15:38,343 --> 02:15:40,811
What did you say your name was?

1018
02:15:42,748 --> 02:15:43,942
And you?

1019
02:15:47,319 --> 02:15:49,082
No.

1020
02:15:54,526 --> 02:15:56,357
Names don't matter.

1021
02:15:57,162 --> 02:16:01,963
Yes, because soon you can join
the gallant heroes of Branston Bridge.

1022
02:16:02,901 --> 02:16:04,960
We have two attacks a day.

1023
02:16:05,037 --> 02:16:07,938
- Two attacks a day?
- Sure.

1024
02:16:08,006 --> 02:16:12,670
The rebs have decided that damn
bridge is the key to this whole area.

1025
02:16:13,312 --> 02:16:16,406
Stupid, useless bridge.

1026
02:16:16,482 --> 02:16:19,713
A flyspeck
on headquarters' maps.

1027
02:16:20,853 --> 02:16:25,847
And headquarters has declared
we must take that ridiculous flyspeck...

1028
02:16:27,259 --> 02:16:29,386
...even if all of us are killed.

1029
02:16:29,461 --> 02:16:34,023
Otherwise, the key will get rusty
and just be a spot on the wall.

1030
02:16:35,334 --> 02:16:37,063
And that's not all.

1031
02:16:37,135 --> 02:16:39,831
Both sides want the bridge intact.

1032
02:16:39,905 --> 02:16:44,467
Intact is how the South wants it,
and we want it intact, too.

1033
02:16:47,145 --> 02:16:51,445
You 'll all turn to dust,
but one thing is sure, boys...

1034
02:16:51,517 --> 02:16:54,918
the Branston Bridge
will stand unbroken.

1035
02:16:55,821 --> 02:16:59,780
Is it bad to speak
the way I do to volunteers?

1036
02:17:01,159 --> 02:17:03,354
I've done a lot worse.

1037
02:17:07,833 --> 02:17:11,200
I've done it.
I've blown it up... boom!

1038
02:17:12,404 --> 02:17:15,532
In here, I've destroyed it all.

1039
02:17:16,375 --> 02:17:20,106
It's a court-martial offense
to imagine, to dream of blowing it up.

1040
02:17:20,178 --> 02:17:21,702
A serious crime.

1041
02:17:21,780 --> 02:17:26,615
Even to think of destroying
that bridge is just...

1042
02:17:28,921 --> 02:17:31,151
Why not really blow it up, Captain?

1043
02:17:32,724 --> 02:17:36,091
Yeah, Captain, it's nothing.
Let's scare the hell out of them.

1044
02:17:39,598 --> 02:17:41,896
I've been dreaming about it.

1045
02:17:45,470 --> 02:17:47,836
I've even worked out a plan.

1046
02:17:49,107 --> 02:17:50,768
I sure have.

1047
02:17:51,677 --> 02:17:55,010
The best time
is after the attack

1048
02:17:55,080 --> 02:17:58,140
when there's a truce
to get the wounded.

1049
02:17:58,850 --> 02:18:03,253
If I could do it, I could save
many thousands of men.

1050
02:18:09,194 --> 02:18:11,424
But what I lack is the guts.

1051
02:18:17,369 --> 02:18:20,566
They're beginning
their daily slaughter right on time.

1052
02:18:20,639 --> 02:18:23,665
Captain, all companies
are awaiting your orders.

1053
02:18:24,209 --> 02:18:25,767
Be right there.

1054
02:18:39,358 --> 02:18:40,791
Let's go.

1055
02:18:41,693 --> 02:18:45,789
All right, friends, come along
and enjoy the spectacle.

1056
02:19:17,029 --> 02:19:19,793
Companies, report!

1057
02:19:19,865 --> 02:19:21,924
Company B ready!

1058
02:19:22,834 --> 02:19:25,496
Company E ready!

1059
02:19:25,570 --> 02:19:28,130
Company D ready!

1060
02:19:33,445 --> 02:19:35,310
Companies!

1061
02:19:35,380 --> 02:19:37,177
Forward!

1062
02:19:58,236 --> 02:20:02,138
Blondie, it looks like the captain
is asking for a bullet in his guts.

1063
02:20:02,207 --> 02:20:03,435
Yeah.

1064
02:20:56,695 --> 02:21:00,563
I've never seen so many men
wasted so badly.

1065
02:21:20,418 --> 02:21:24,787
I have a feeling it's really
going to be a good long battle.

1066
02:21:28,160 --> 02:21:29,422
Blondie...

1067
02:21:30,428 --> 02:21:33,090
The money's
on the other side of the river.

1068
02:21:34,599 --> 02:21:35,759
Where?

1069
02:21:38,370 --> 02:21:41,498
Amigo, I said the other side,
and that's enough.

1070
02:21:42,407 --> 02:21:45,740
But while the Confederates
are there, we can't get across.

1071
02:21:47,112 --> 02:21:51,776
What would happen if somebody
were to blow up that bridge?

1072
02:21:52,551 --> 02:21:53,984
Yeah.

1073
02:21:54,719 --> 02:21:57,415
Then these idiots would go
somewhere else to fight.

1074
02:22:37,629 --> 02:22:40,598
Doctor, quick!
The captain's wounded!

1075
02:22:42,801 --> 02:22:44,894
Hurry. A stretcher.

1076
02:22:46,938 --> 02:22:48,929
Easy. Easy now.

1077
02:22:59,651 --> 02:23:01,141
Get things ready.

1078
02:23:22,173 --> 02:23:23,765
A little of this will help.

1079
02:23:30,749 --> 02:23:33,217
Take a slug of this, Captain.

1080
02:24:24,002 --> 02:24:26,994
What are you doing?
No! Leave me alone!

1081
02:26:06,171 --> 02:26:07,798
Blondie...

1082
02:26:07,872 --> 02:26:10,238
You realize we might be
risking our lives?

1083
02:26:10,875 --> 02:26:13,173
Yeah. And if I get killed,

1084
02:26:13,244 --> 02:26:16,577
you 'll never get your hands
on all that beautiful money.

1085
02:26:16,648 --> 02:26:18,445
Yeah, Tuco...

1086
02:26:19,250 --> 02:26:21,718
It sure would be a pity.

1087
02:26:51,649 --> 02:26:52,775
Doc...

1088
02:26:54,986 --> 02:26:57,011
Doctor...

1089
02:26:57,088 --> 02:26:59,921
If you help me live a little more,

1090
02:26:59,991 --> 02:27:02,357
I expect good news.

1091
02:27:52,877 --> 02:27:55,971
Why don't we tell each other
our half of the secret?

1092
02:27:56,047 --> 02:27:57,912
Why don't we?

1093
02:27:59,551 --> 02:28:01,143
You go first.

1094
02:28:03,321 --> 02:28:06,654
No, I think it's better that...

1095
02:28:08,226 --> 02:28:10,057
...you start.

1096
02:28:13,898 --> 02:28:15,126
All right.

1097
02:28:17,602 --> 02:28:20,662
The name of
the cemetery is...

1098
02:28:37,855 --> 02:28:40,153
Sad Hill.
Now it's your turn.

1099
02:28:48,399 --> 02:28:51,197
The name on the grave is...

1100
02:28:54,906 --> 02:28:56,703
Arch Stanton.

1101
02:28:56,774 --> 02:29:00,232
Arch Stanton?

1102
02:29:00,311 --> 02:29:01,676
Are you sure?

1103
02:29:02,680 --> 02:29:04,875
Yeah, sure I'm sure.

1104
02:40:53,190 --> 02:40:55,784
It'll be a lot easier with that.

1105
02:41:35,733 --> 02:41:37,997
Two can dig
a lot quicker than one.

1106
02:41:38,635 --> 02:41:40,102
Dig.

1107
02:41:42,906 --> 02:41:44,430
You 're not digging.

1108
02:41:56,720 --> 02:42:00,588
If you shoot me,
you won't see a cent of that money.

1109
02:42:01,892 --> 02:42:03,484
Why?

1110
02:42:06,296 --> 02:42:07,854
I'll tell you why.

1111
02:42:09,333 --> 02:42:11,631
'Cause there's nothing in there.

1112
02:42:19,743 --> 02:42:22,974
- Why, you son of a...
- You thought I'd trust you?

1113
02:42:26,150 --> 02:42:28,175
$200,000 is a lot of money.

1114
02:42:30,154 --> 02:42:32,554
We're going to have to earn it.

1115
02:42:35,192 --> 02:42:36,352
How?

1116
02:42:48,138 --> 02:42:50,868
I'll write the name
on the bottom of this stone.

1117
02:42:54,912 --> 02:42:56,777
The gun...

1118
02:49:02,746 --> 02:49:05,340
You pig!
You want to get me killed?

1119
02:49:05,415 --> 02:49:06,814
When'd you unload it?

1120
02:49:08,819 --> 02:49:10,616
Last night.

1121
02:49:11,321 --> 02:49:15,815
You see, in this world,
there's two kinds of people, my friend...

1122
02:49:15,892 --> 02:49:18,156
those with loaded guns...

1123
02:49:18,228 --> 02:49:20,594
and those who dig.

1124
02:49:20,664 --> 02:49:23,656
- You dig.
- Where?

1125
02:49:34,511 --> 02:49:35,842
Here.

1126
02:49:37,881 --> 02:49:39,781
''Unk... Unk... ''

1127
02:49:39,850 --> 02:49:41,477
There's no name on it.

1128
02:49:43,220 --> 02:49:45,620
There's no name here either.

1129
02:49:46,923 --> 02:49:49,858
You see, that's what
Bill Carson told me.

1130
02:49:49,926 --> 02:49:54,226
It was the grave marked ''unknown''
right beside Arch Stanton.

1131
02:50:01,705 --> 02:50:03,195
Go ahead.

1132
02:51:00,864 --> 02:51:03,856
Blondie!
It's all ours, Blondie!

1133
02:51:20,584 --> 02:51:21,949
You 're joking, Blondie.

1134
02:51:22,018 --> 02:51:24,748
You wouldn't play a joke
on me like that?

1135
02:51:25,956 --> 02:51:28,390
It's no joke.
It's a rope, Tuco.

1136
02:51:29,092 --> 02:51:32,619
Now, I want you to stand up there
and put your head in that noose.

1137
02:52:39,796 --> 02:52:41,354
Well, now...

1138
02:52:41,865 --> 02:52:43,833
Seems just like old times.

1139
02:52:48,271 --> 02:52:50,068
Four for you...

1140
02:52:51,975 --> 02:52:54,000
And four...

1141
02:52:56,680 --> 02:52:58,511
Four for me.

1142
02:53:37,220 --> 02:53:39,518
Blondie...

1143
02:53:40,557 --> 02:53:42,354
Sorry, Tuco.

1144
02:53:46,463 --> 02:53:47,828
Blondie!

1145
02:53:56,873 --> 02:53:59,341
Blondie!

1146
02:55:11,915 --> 02:55:14,008
You son of a...

1147
02:56:18,715 --> 02:56:20,910
Hey, Blondie!

1148
02:56:22,352 --> 02:56:25,879
You know what you are?

1149
02:56:29,125 --> 02:56:31,116
Just a dirty son of a b...

1150
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:35,074
