1
00:00:17,067 --> 00:00:20,457
Hey, Stifler, how come Steve
got all the talent in your family?

2
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:23,943
Bite me, Fuck Face.
Come on, man, you're missing it.

3
00:00:24,147 --> 00:00:27,298
I've seen it a million times,
you fucking ass-booger.

4
00:00:27,387 --> 00:00:31,062
Steve is like a filmmaking genius.
A true American hero.

5
00:00:31,147 --> 00:00:32,626
The Tarantino of titties.

6
00:00:32,707 --> 00:00:34,982
Yeah, there's just no way
you could ever be this good.

7
00:00:35,067 --> 00:00:36,546
Hey, look, I'm going to prove to Steve...

8
00:00:36,627 --> 00:00:39,664
that I'm up to the standards
of the Stiffmeister Productions.

9
00:00:40,187 --> 00:00:42,303
After Steve sees my directing talent...

10
00:00:42,387 --> 00:00:45,697
- little bro's joining the family business.
- Is that what he said?

11
00:00:45,787 --> 00:00:49,780
- He finally called you back?
- No, but I left him another message.

12
00:00:51,347 --> 00:00:54,498
He'll get back to me.
It's only been three weeks.

13
00:00:55,667 --> 00:01:00,661
Gentle-fucks, a toast.
Tomorrow, we begin our reign as seniors.

14
00:02:00,067 --> 00:02:02,342
Okay, people, let's take a break.

15
00:02:02,707 --> 00:02:06,859
Remember, we play this at the end of
the ceremony after Pomp and Circumstance.

16
00:02:06,947 --> 00:02:09,097
I don't want anyone starting
the wrong song again.

17
00:02:09,187 --> 00:02:12,020
- Elyse, you need to relax, girl.
- I'm fine.

18
00:02:12,347 --> 00:02:15,145
I just... You know,
it's my first time up here, and...

19
00:02:15,227 --> 00:02:17,821
Yeah, but it's graduation.
It ain't the Boston Pops.

20
00:02:17,907 --> 00:02:20,979
This performance sets the tone
for our senior year. I mean...

21
00:02:21,067 --> 00:02:25,583
Look, you just remember
that everybody here is pulling for you.

22
00:02:29,467 --> 00:02:31,981
Dork. Dork. Dork. Goose.

23
00:02:32,907 --> 00:02:36,377
- I like them feisty.
- What're you doing here, Stifler?

24
00:02:36,467 --> 00:02:38,981
We just want to say sayonara,
and let you fuck-necks know...

25
00:02:39,067 --> 00:02:43,777
we plan on winning the state title, now that
the Stiffmeister's running the show.

26
00:02:43,867 --> 00:02:47,701
- Adios, butt-hugger.
- He's a bigger asshole than his brother.

27
00:02:51,147 --> 00:02:52,899
Holy shit, Arrianna.

28
00:02:53,747 --> 00:02:55,897
Matt, what're you doing here?

29
00:02:56,027 --> 00:03:00,100
Oh, we just want to make sure
the seniors have a very memorable last day.

30
00:03:00,187 --> 00:03:03,020
That's cool. So, there's a campout tonight...

31
00:03:03,107 --> 00:03:06,065
and it's only for the grads,
but you could come.

32
00:03:06,147 --> 00:03:08,707
Let me check my schedule. Hell, yeah.

33
00:03:09,947 --> 00:03:13,622
Bring your sleeping bag,
in case we decide to pitch a tent.

34
00:03:18,347 --> 00:03:22,101
Check it out. Perfect timing.
This is going to be classic.

35
00:03:22,667 --> 00:03:25,898
Time to initiate
Operation Gradu-fuck-uation.

36
00:03:28,507 --> 00:03:30,338
This is gonna be awesome.

37
00:03:30,427 --> 00:03:32,179
- Shit.
- Oh, yeah! Jackpot!

38
00:03:32,507 --> 00:03:36,216
Payback, seniors.
Don't get that pepper spray on your hands.

39
00:03:39,147 --> 00:03:41,945
A graduation gift from the Stiffmeister.

40
00:03:45,347 --> 00:03:47,781
Dude, we should've sprayed
the diplomas.

41
00:03:50,027 --> 00:03:51,506
Sorry, bandees.

42
00:03:56,467 --> 00:04:00,062
Bite my nuts and call me Skippy.
It's a Steely Dan.

43
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:03,424
- A what?
- It's a double-headed dildo.

44
00:04:04,107 --> 00:04:05,540
It's a dildo. It's a dildo.

45
00:04:06,147 --> 00:04:08,297
- Holy shit.
- It's even got a name.

46
00:04:09,947 --> 00:04:10,936
Picardo?

47
00:04:11,307 --> 00:04:14,299
- Spray that shit.
- Fuck, no. Finders keepers.

48
00:04:14,547 --> 00:04:17,823
Okay, everybody, Pomp and
Circumstance.  Five-minute warning. Let's go.

49
00:04:17,907 --> 00:04:20,137
The bandees. Let's get out of here.

50
00:04:24,107 --> 00:04:26,063
- Matt?
- Leesy.

51
00:04:27,547 --> 00:04:30,380
How they hanging?
Still small and perky, I see.

52
00:04:30,467 --> 00:04:32,776
- That's funny.
- Yeah.

53
00:04:33,787 --> 00:04:37,621
- What're you doing here, Matt?
- I just came by to wish you good luck.

54
00:04:37,707 --> 00:04:40,141
- You know, on the whole music thing.
- Good luck?

55
00:04:40,227 --> 00:04:42,900
You haven't said a word to me
since the eighth grade.

56
00:04:42,987 --> 00:04:45,899
Yeah, and that tone of voice
is exactly the reason why.

57
00:04:45,987 --> 00:04:48,262
So, I'm going to take off now.

58
00:04:52,027 --> 00:04:56,179
Ladies and gentlemen,
please rise to honor our graduates.

59
00:04:56,267 --> 00:04:57,859
Douchebag's gonna miss it.

60
00:05:10,107 --> 00:05:11,381
Oh, yes.

61
00:05:14,587 --> 00:05:16,179
Are they crying?

62
00:05:18,787 --> 00:05:20,140
Holy shit!

63
00:05:26,627 --> 00:05:27,776
Yes!

64
00:05:48,387 --> 00:05:50,059
Eat shit, seniors.

65
00:06:09,387 --> 00:06:10,376
Uh oh!

66
00:06:10,707 --> 00:06:12,902
Stifler!

67
00:06:15,467 --> 00:06:18,982
I've been waiting for this moment
for a very long time.

68
00:06:20,187 --> 00:06:22,860
And now, the day of reckoning has come.

69
00:06:25,987 --> 00:06:27,466
Hello, Matthew.

70
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:30,262
Your brother must be very proud.

71
00:06:32,827 --> 00:06:34,977
You've continued his legacy.

72
00:06:35,947 --> 00:06:38,017
Tormenting the innocent...

73
00:06:38,627 --> 00:06:41,585
defiling all that is good and pure.

74
00:06:44,867 --> 00:06:47,461
But now, you're going down.

75
00:06:48,507 --> 00:06:51,579
What're you going to do,
expel me, Shermanator?

76
00:06:52,907 --> 00:06:55,740
I am a sophisticated counseling machine...

77
00:06:55,827 --> 00:06:59,422
sent back in time
to guide young and innocent minds.

78
00:06:59,787 --> 00:07:04,577
My primary directive is to protect
the students of this institution...

79
00:07:05,427 --> 00:07:08,180
and all, indeed all mankind...

80
00:07:08,907 --> 00:07:11,705
from the menace that is another Stifler.

81
00:07:11,907 --> 00:07:14,375
Behavior modification is required.

82
00:07:14,707 --> 00:07:17,426
It's not too late to change your future.

83
00:07:20,067 --> 00:07:23,855
No, expulsion would be too easy.

84
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:30,064
I know the perfect punishment
to fit your crime.

85
00:07:32,467 --> 00:07:35,459
Since you have so much trouble
with the band...

86
00:07:35,627 --> 00:07:38,221
perhaps you should make friends with them.

87
00:07:38,307 --> 00:07:39,899
No fucking way.

88
00:07:41,667 --> 00:07:46,104
Either you learn to be more considerate
or you will be expelled.

89
00:07:46,907 --> 00:07:48,340
No football.

90
00:07:49,267 --> 00:07:50,416
No parties.

91
00:07:50,507 --> 00:07:52,259
No spring break.

92
00:07:52,987 --> 00:07:55,455
No graduation.

93
00:07:55,787 --> 00:07:57,345
No college.

94
00:07:57,427 --> 00:07:59,065
No coeds.

95
00:07:59,907 --> 00:08:01,260
Comprende?

96
00:08:05,787 --> 00:08:07,743
Pack your bags, Stifler.

97
00:08:08,267 --> 00:08:10,940
- You're going to Band Camp.
- Band Camp!

98
00:08:17,387 --> 00:08:19,617
Bullshit, trash.

99
00:08:24,107 --> 00:08:25,540
All right, Steve! Valley Girls Gone Wild.

100
00:08:27,187 --> 00:08:28,222
Fuck.

101
00:08:46,187 --> 00:08:47,415
Told you Steve'd get back to me.

102
00:08:47,507 --> 00:08:48,826
I mean, it was just a postcard...

103
00:08:48,907 --> 00:08:51,023
but it gave me a great idea.

104
00:08:51,107 --> 00:08:52,176
Look...

105
00:08:52,267 --> 00:08:54,303
Steve's shit-head friend, Jim...

106
00:08:54,387 --> 00:08:56,742
he married
this freaking nympho band-geek, Michelle.

107
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:59,625
And he said
all they do at Band Camp is screw 24/7.

108
00:08:59,707 --> 00:09:03,666
Matt, buddy, you cannot screw band chicks.
There are standards.

109
00:09:04,987 --> 00:09:08,263
I'm not talking about screwing them,
scrotum-breath.

110
00:09:08,387 --> 00:09:10,821
I'm talking about videotaping them.

111
00:09:10,907 --> 00:09:14,297
People love to see dorks doing
that freaky shit on hidden video.

112
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:18,062
Bandeez Gone Wild. 
Steve's gonna have some competition now...

113
00:09:18,227 --> 00:09:20,695
because little bro's
joining the family business.

114
00:09:25,747 --> 00:09:27,305
Yeah, Spy Chest.

115
00:09:27,987 --> 00:09:29,420
Secret Video.

116
00:09:31,187 --> 00:09:32,176
Hell, yeah.

117
00:09:35,707 --> 00:09:36,981
Color night vision? I'll take it. Shit.

118
00:09:44,907 --> 00:09:46,545
How about tomorrow?
This is going be great.

119
00:10:26,907 --> 00:10:29,740
Welcome to Tall Oaks 2005.

120
00:10:30,907 --> 00:10:33,580
Let's hear it from Lloyd Memorial High.

121
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:35,976
L- L-O-Y-D!

122
00:10:36,707 --> 00:10:38,186
L- L-O-Y-D!

123
00:10:39,387 --> 00:10:41,059
- Mount St. Marie. 
- Mount St. Marie!

124
00:10:41,227 --> 00:10:42,546
Mount St. Marie!

125
00:10:42,627 --> 00:10:44,185
East Great Falls High.

126
00:10:44,787 --> 00:10:46,186
East Great Falls!

127
00:10:46,707 --> 00:10:48,140
East Great Falls!

128
00:10:48,987 --> 00:10:52,138
And five-time defending
Tall Oaks Cup Champion...

129
00:10:52,427 --> 00:10:54,145
Beechwood Academy.

130
00:10:54,227 --> 00:10:56,866
We're Number One! We're Number One!
We're Number One!

131
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:58,096
Okay, settle down.

132
00:10:58,947 --> 00:11:01,142
Now, as you know, each year...

133
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:04,139
one senior Tall Oaks composer is awarded...

134
00:11:04,227 --> 00:11:08,539
a full scholarship
to the prestigious Robards Conservatory.

135
00:11:08,627 --> 00:11:10,697
Elyse, this is your year to win.

136
00:11:10,787 --> 00:11:13,859
This year, Dr. Susan Choi,
president of Robards...

137
00:11:13,947 --> 00:11:16,745
will judge the compositions herself.

138
00:11:16,827 --> 00:11:21,139
And let's not forget to welcome
the Tall Oaks Camp Counselors.

139
00:11:28,147 --> 00:11:32,220
If you visit our infirmary, Nurse Sanders
will take care of your every need.

140
00:11:34,787 --> 00:11:39,178
Okay, so let's work hard,
and may the best band win.

141
00:11:46,827 --> 00:11:47,896
You guys ready?

142
00:12:05,867 --> 00:12:07,380
What the fuck?

143
00:12:07,667 --> 00:12:10,022
Are you a rookie? You look lost.

144
00:12:10,387 --> 00:12:13,982
Are you an asshole?
You're hairy, and you smell like shit.

145
00:12:15,587 --> 00:12:18,579
I'll ignore that kind of talk once.

146
00:12:19,667 --> 00:12:21,737
We don't speak that way here.

147
00:12:21,827 --> 00:12:26,105
Rookies are to wear their beanies
at all times. Those are the rules.

148
00:12:26,187 --> 00:12:28,860
And who made you
the mayor of Geek Town?

149
00:12:29,667 --> 00:12:33,626
I'm Brandon Vandecamp,
senior drum major, Beechwood Academy...

150
00:12:33,707 --> 00:12:35,379
and the president of the Tall Oaks Council.

151
00:12:35,467 --> 00:12:39,301
Oh, and who are they, Mr. President?
The First Lady and Vice Pussy?

152
00:12:45,187 --> 00:12:46,506
Suits you well.

153
00:12:46,627 --> 00:12:51,178
Golly, jeepers, thanks. Hey, you know,
since I'm an official band geek and all...

154
00:12:51,267 --> 00:12:53,417
can you guess
what my favorite piece of music is?

155
00:12:53,507 --> 00:12:55,862
- I have no idea.
- The Nutcracker.

156
00:12:58,187 --> 00:12:59,222
Step back, bitch.

157
00:12:59,307 --> 00:13:01,582
Holy mother of Mozart.

158
00:13:03,427 --> 00:13:04,496
This is bad.

159
00:13:04,587 --> 00:13:07,147
You didn't know Jackie Chan
was in the house, did you boys, huh?

160
00:13:07,227 --> 00:13:09,138
Stop that. Stop that now.

161
00:13:09,227 --> 00:13:11,457
Those knob-slobbers started it.

162
00:13:11,547 --> 00:13:14,061
That's not true, sir.
We simply reminded him to wear his beanie.

163
00:13:14,147 --> 00:13:16,422
And then he viciously assaulted
Brandon's genitals.

164
00:13:16,507 --> 00:13:20,785
- That's a lie, you dick-snot.
- Oscar, Jimmy, escort this man to see...

165
00:13:21,027 --> 00:13:23,257
- the Macro.
- The what?

166
00:13:23,707 --> 00:13:25,857
- You're dead.
- Now, gentlemen.

167
00:13:26,667 --> 00:13:28,737
God, Brandon, are you okay?

168
00:13:29,747 --> 00:13:32,181
You want to tell me
what the hell you're doing here, Stifler?

169
00:13:32,267 --> 00:13:34,701
It don't matter, Big O.
He ain't gonna be here long.

170
00:13:34,787 --> 00:13:35,856
- Bitch!
- Get over here.

171
00:13:35,947 --> 00:13:38,063
Macro gonna fuck your ass up, fool.

172
00:13:38,147 --> 00:13:40,615
- What the fuck's a macro?
- The Macro.

173
00:13:40,707 --> 00:13:42,823
Morale And Conflict Resolution Officer.

174
00:13:42,907 --> 00:13:45,182
I heard this one time,
this kid went into that office...

175
00:13:45,267 --> 00:13:46,939
a baritone and came out a soprano.

176
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:49,860
- Clarinet up the ass backwards, yo.
- What?

177
00:13:57,107 --> 00:13:58,381
Pussies.

178
00:14:11,707 --> 00:14:13,026
Oh, I'm sorry.

179
00:14:15,107 --> 00:14:17,177
Frankenstein.  Scary stuff.

180
00:14:18,387 --> 00:14:20,696
I am just a Boris Karloff nut.

181
00:14:20,987 --> 00:14:24,900
- I'm the Macro, Mr. Levenstein.
- Holy shit, you're Jim's dad.

182
00:14:25,467 --> 00:14:28,300
He screwed that redheaded nympho chick
at my lake house.

183
00:14:28,387 --> 00:14:31,936
- Oh, my, you're not a Stifler?
- Yeah, I'm Steve's brother, Matt.

184
00:14:33,307 --> 00:14:36,777
- There are two Stiflers?
- Yes, sir. Hey, what're you doing here?

185
00:14:36,867 --> 00:14:40,701
Oh, well, Jim is now out of the house,
married to Michelle...

186
00:14:40,787 --> 00:14:43,824
that redheaded nympho chick
that you spoke of.

187
00:14:45,027 --> 00:14:47,860
And, being a former
Tall Oaks Counselor of the Year...

188
00:14:47,947 --> 00:14:52,862
she was hired to be the Macro this summer,
but she got pregnant.

189
00:14:53,187 --> 00:14:56,497
No doubt due to the tendencies
you alluded to earlier.

190
00:14:56,587 --> 00:14:59,499
And I have a great rapport with
young people...

191
00:14:59,587 --> 00:15:01,896
so I just stepped in and volunteered.

192
00:15:01,987 --> 00:15:05,377
That cretin is not in our band,
and we are not responsible for his actions.

193
00:15:05,467 --> 00:15:08,106
- Who pissed in your piccolo?
- I'm sensing some hostility here.

194
00:15:08,187 --> 00:15:09,461
- He poisoned my band.
- What?

195
00:15:09,547 --> 00:15:12,425
- I'm the Macro and it's my job to deal with...
- What is he doing here?

196
00:15:12,507 --> 00:15:15,783
- Matt Stifler is pure evil just like his brother.
... conflict.

197
00:15:15,867 --> 00:15:17,300
Thanks, Leesy.

198
00:15:21,907 --> 00:15:23,420
She seems nice.

199
00:15:24,347 --> 00:15:25,746
There are rules, of course.

200
00:15:25,827 --> 00:15:27,465
- You will have to wear a beanie.
- Yeah.

201
00:15:27,547 --> 00:15:30,823
Oh, I know. It's a little silly,
but it's tradition here...

202
00:15:30,907 --> 00:15:34,377
something you're familiar with,
being on the football team, I'm sure...

203
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:37,857
with your elephant walks and circle jerks
and drinking butt beer.

204
00:15:37,947 --> 00:15:40,177
But here, you just have to wear
a silly little hat and...

205
00:15:40,267 --> 00:15:42,701
- a somewhat stylish Tall Oaks T-shirt.
- Yeah.

206
00:15:43,307 --> 00:15:45,263
So, just go with the flow, Matt...

207
00:15:45,347 --> 00:15:47,656
and you will have loads of fun...

208
00:15:48,027 --> 00:15:50,939
and you'll be making new friends in no time.

209
00:15:57,667 --> 00:16:00,420
Hey, Ernie Kaplowitz, tenor sax.

210
00:16:01,667 --> 00:16:04,181
Cool! I'm a rookie here, too.

211
00:16:04,427 --> 00:16:08,181
I really wanted to come last year,
but Computer Camp conflicted, and...

212
00:16:08,347 --> 00:16:12,306
Oh, yeah, that was here when I arrived.
I think it has your name on it.

213
00:16:14,347 --> 00:16:15,700
What is it?

214
00:16:17,387 --> 00:16:20,902
Hi, welcome to Casa de Stifler. 
I'll be your host, Matt.

215
00:16:21,067 --> 00:16:24,457
Every day here, I'll make it my sincere goal
not to have to kick your ass.

216
00:16:24,547 --> 00:16:27,266
Allow me to show you
to your new accommodations.

217
00:16:28,267 --> 00:16:30,781
When I'm out here, you're in there.

218
00:16:31,947 --> 00:16:33,903
Have a great day, fucko.

219
00:16:34,187 --> 00:16:35,336
I don't...

220
00:16:38,627 --> 00:16:39,742
Okay...

221
00:16:39,827 --> 00:16:41,419
I'll just go and put this stuff away for you.

222
00:16:41,507 --> 00:16:42,701
All right. Bandee-vision.

223
00:16:45,387 --> 00:16:49,460
This is a 1978 Ohio State show...

224
00:16:49,547 --> 00:16:50,866
The Wizard Of Oz.

225
00:16:50,947 --> 00:16:54,542
The one where the sousaphone player
forgot to dot the I? Oh, hey.

226
00:16:56,467 --> 00:16:59,061
Yeah, right. Freaks.

227
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:03,342
Never fear, the Stiffmeister's here.

228
00:17:03,427 --> 00:17:06,464
Band Camp just got
a whole lot better, ladies.

229
00:17:06,587 --> 00:17:09,055
You're Steve Stifler's younger brother,
aren't you?

230
00:17:09,147 --> 00:17:10,899
- Young and hung.
- Great.

231
00:17:11,027 --> 00:17:14,224
- Could you send him a message for me?
- No problem, senorita.

232
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:25,339
Well, it looks like Steve gave someone
the old Stifler bang-and-boot.

233
00:17:26,387 --> 00:17:29,538
- Is there a problem here?
- No, everything's fine.

234
00:17:31,507 --> 00:17:34,624
- Have fun at Band Camp.
- Thank you, I will.

235
00:17:38,467 --> 00:17:40,697
- Later.
- Word.

236
00:17:41,187 --> 00:17:43,860
You need to start showing some respect
around here, Stifler.

237
00:17:43,947 --> 00:17:47,223
You need to show yourself
back to your table, Big Dog.

238
00:17:47,307 --> 00:17:49,059
Out of my way, Yo.

239
00:17:50,387 --> 00:17:54,266
Hola, chicas. 
Elyse, so good to see you again.

240
00:17:54,587 --> 00:17:57,579
So, what's going on tonight?
We gonna party, get a little crazy?

241
00:17:57,667 --> 00:18:00,135
Who wants to rack up
a few frequent fucker miles?

242
00:18:00,227 --> 00:18:03,185
- You know, you are the most...
- Most sexy man ever to come to Band Camp.

243
00:18:03,267 --> 00:18:07,146
- What? Chloe, he is so obnoxious.
- Sexy obnoxious.

244
00:18:07,227 --> 00:18:10,185
- Thank you.
- I'm tired of messing around with these...

245
00:18:10,267 --> 00:18:12,098
dorky-ass nice guys...

246
00:18:12,227 --> 00:18:14,377
and sensitive-artist types.

247
00:18:14,747 --> 00:18:19,104
- Let's party with a real hombre tonight.
- Hell, yeah. That's me:

248
00:18:19,627 --> 00:18:23,461
- 100% hombre. 
- All right, my room, 8:00.

249
00:18:24,587 --> 00:18:28,102
Great first day, campers. 
This is your Macro speaking...

250
00:18:28,187 --> 00:18:31,577
and, hey, morale
couldn't have been higher today.

251
00:18:31,667 --> 00:18:34,306
So hop in the sack,
and get a good night's sleep because...

252
00:18:35,667 --> 00:18:38,465
starting tomorrow, we have
many, many exciting activities planned...

253
00:18:38,547 --> 00:18:42,142
not the least of which is
the race for the Tall Oaks Cup.

254
00:18:42,307 --> 00:18:44,263
So let the games begin.

255
00:18:44,547 --> 00:18:48,335
Bandeez Gone Wild. 
Scene One. Party hombre.

256
00:18:53,027 --> 00:18:57,179
It's called Strip Trivia. We made it up.
It's a Band Camp tradition.

257
00:18:57,507 --> 00:19:01,625
"Fourth and Long," "Sextuplets,"
"Banging Babes," and "Who Blew Me?"

258
00:19:01,747 --> 00:19:04,784
This looks like my kind of game.
Shall we play?

259
00:19:05,747 --> 00:19:08,625
You sit in the middle.
Your game, my seating chart.

260
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:10,226
Sit a little closer, ladies.

261
00:19:10,307 --> 00:19:12,537
Don't be scared. It's all right.

262
00:19:12,627 --> 00:19:13,742
Okay...

263
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:16,905
the rules are simple. 
You choose a category and a question...

264
00:19:16,987 --> 00:19:19,342
and every time you miss, you strip.

265
00:19:19,427 --> 00:19:20,462
Hell, yeah.

266
00:19:20,547 --> 00:19:24,062
- I'll go first. "Who Blew Me?"
- Good.

267
00:19:27,227 --> 00:19:31,505
I am a silver Stradivarius trumpet
played by a Pulitzer Prize winner.

268
00:19:32,507 --> 00:19:33,781
Who blew me?

269
00:19:33,947 --> 00:19:36,336
- Yeah, like I'd know.
- Sorry.

270
00:19:36,547 --> 00:19:37,946
Lose the shoes, and pick again.

271
00:19:38,027 --> 00:19:39,904
You didn't tell me this shit was about music.

272
00:19:39,987 --> 00:19:43,457
- Well, it is Band Camp, moron.
- Hey, to be fair...

273
00:19:43,747 --> 00:19:46,659
maybe we should just give him a head start.

274
00:19:50,067 --> 00:19:51,705
All right. Yeah.

275
00:19:52,867 --> 00:19:54,539
Okay, all right. All right.

276
00:19:56,067 --> 00:19:58,865
What's wrong with you?
Scared to show off the mosquito bites?

277
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:01,586
I've matured since the fourth grade, Matt.
Have you?

278
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:04,579
Oh, I've got 10 pounds of dangling maturity
right here, Leesy.

279
00:20:04,667 --> 00:20:07,500
- Quit calling me that.
- Okay, okay, moving on.

280
00:20:08,187 --> 00:20:12,260
- Matt, just pick another question, please.
- All right, screw it. Whatever.

281
00:20:12,867 --> 00:20:14,983
There you go. Suck on that.

282
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:19,101
- Fourth and Long.
- Sure, no problem.

283
00:20:22,267 --> 00:20:26,579
Of Beethoven's major symphonies,
which has the longest fourth movement?

284
00:20:27,467 --> 00:20:29,264
All right, I see where this is going.

285
00:20:29,347 --> 00:20:31,941
Fine, you win.

286
00:20:36,227 --> 00:20:37,421
I free ball, ladies.

287
00:20:38,067 --> 00:20:42,106
Got to let the big boys breathe.
All right, we play by my rules now.

288
00:20:42,547 --> 00:20:45,345
Football questions only.
Prepare to strip, ladies.

289
00:20:46,067 --> 00:20:49,537
- Wait. But first, does anybody want a beer?
- I do.

290
00:20:49,987 --> 00:20:54,742
The counselors have a secret stash
in the fridge across the hall.

291
00:20:54,907 --> 00:20:58,616
- Would you mind?
- Now we're talking about a fucking party.

292
00:20:58,707 --> 00:21:00,425
Stiffy'll be back in a jiffy.

293
00:21:02,627 --> 00:21:05,095
I mean, there's nobody around...

294
00:21:05,187 --> 00:21:07,496
and we haven't seen your best side yet.

295
00:21:13,867 --> 00:21:15,983
Yes! We got him.

296
00:21:17,987 --> 00:21:19,739
So busted.

297
00:21:27,187 --> 00:21:29,621
Man, big boys, wake up.

298
00:21:29,707 --> 00:21:32,096
Just gotta turn down the A.C. In there, huh?

299
00:21:32,187 --> 00:21:33,302
Good night, girls.

300
00:21:40,387 --> 00:21:42,901
Sorry, asshole, game's over.

301
00:21:43,107 --> 00:21:47,339
Yeah, the big boys
will love the long walk home.

302
00:21:48,187 --> 00:21:49,905
Room check, girls.

303
00:21:51,307 --> 00:21:52,376
Oh, shit.

304
00:21:52,707 --> 00:21:54,857
- Ditch his clothes.
- Out the window.

305
00:21:55,587 --> 00:21:57,942
All right, who wants a long neck?

306
00:22:04,547 --> 00:22:06,219
Nurse Sanders.

307
00:22:08,907 --> 00:22:11,296
- They set me up.
- He attacked us with pepper spray...

308
00:22:11,387 --> 00:22:13,981
- and ruined our graduation.
- I went there for a friendly game...

309
00:22:14,067 --> 00:22:15,102
Hold it. Hold it. Kids.

310
00:22:15,187 --> 00:22:17,143
Okay...

311
00:22:17,387 --> 00:22:19,059
where are your clothes?

312
00:22:21,627 --> 00:22:23,026
I have them.

313
00:22:23,627 --> 00:22:25,538
- May I ask why?
- Well, they got me naked...

314
00:22:25,627 --> 00:22:28,744
- Oh, whatever. He took his own pants off...
- And they stole my clothes.

315
00:22:28,827 --> 00:22:31,466
And I got stuck up there
with Mrs. Doubtfire checking out my...

316
00:22:37,387 --> 00:22:39,264
Let me see if I have this straight.

317
00:22:39,427 --> 00:22:43,898
Elyse, you think Matt is an arrogant jock
who wears his penis on his forehead...

318
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:47,263
just to gain the approval of
his sociopathic brother.

319
00:22:47,347 --> 00:22:51,101
And Matt, you think Elyse
is an uptight, geeky prude...

320
00:22:51,187 --> 00:22:53,826
who needs to loosen up and get laid.

321
00:22:53,907 --> 00:22:56,979
Excuse the expression, dear.
Is that close to being on the money?

322
00:22:58,667 --> 00:22:59,782
Look, kids...

323
00:23:01,187 --> 00:23:03,655
the only way to solve your differences...

324
00:23:04,307 --> 00:23:05,899
is by working together.

325
00:23:07,027 --> 00:23:08,745
So why don't you start tomorrow...

326
00:23:09,147 --> 00:23:12,105
by putting one foot in front of the other?

327
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:17,345
Left flank hut.

328
00:23:19,707 --> 00:23:21,140
Turn and hut.

329
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:29,701
What the fuck!

330
00:23:31,187 --> 00:23:32,939
Band 10 hut!

331
00:23:33,187 --> 00:23:34,176
Holy shit.

332
00:23:34,707 --> 00:23:38,097
When I yell "band 10 hut,"
you snap firmly at attention.

333
00:23:38,187 --> 00:23:41,736
- You want to see me firmly at attention?
- I already have. I wasn't impressed.

334
00:23:44,547 --> 00:23:45,696
Look...

335
00:23:46,547 --> 00:23:48,424
we've never beaten Beechwood, okay?

336
00:23:49,307 --> 00:23:51,138
For some of us, it's our last shot.

337
00:23:53,827 --> 00:23:55,340
Just stop screwing up, okay?

338
00:23:55,427 --> 00:23:56,780
Yeah, asshole.

339
00:23:59,267 --> 00:24:01,417
Okay, people, back to work, let's go.
Whatever.

340
00:24:01,507 --> 00:24:02,826
I don't need this shit.

341
00:24:02,907 --> 00:24:05,262
Reset the block. Front ranks, right here.

342
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:19,941
Housekeeping.

343
00:24:46,267 --> 00:24:48,576
Oscar, brought me something to drink?

344
00:24:48,867 --> 00:24:51,745
- Come on.
- Good looking out, baby.

345
00:24:54,227 --> 00:24:55,899
Hey, it's Ernie Crapowitz.

346
00:24:55,987 --> 00:24:58,979
So you finally came out of the closet.
Good for you.

347
00:25:00,307 --> 00:25:02,741
Look, I want to know
what goes on at night, all right?

348
00:25:02,827 --> 00:25:05,341
All the crazy shit.
Naked pillow fights, whatever.

349
00:25:05,427 --> 00:25:08,783
Do I look like the guy that's in charge of
the naked pillow fights, huh?

350
00:25:08,867 --> 00:25:10,346
It's my first time here.

351
00:25:10,427 --> 00:25:11,576
Notice the beanie?

352
00:25:11,667 --> 00:25:12,736
Yes.

353
00:25:13,667 --> 00:25:15,066
Yes, I do.

354
00:25:15,147 --> 00:25:18,378
Yes, speaking of beanies,
where's yours, Stifler?

355
00:25:18,707 --> 00:25:20,584
You still not following the rules, huh?

356
00:25:20,667 --> 00:25:22,498
- Let's see.
- Look. He's getting in trouble again.

357
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:25,863
No standard-issue Tall Oaks T-shirt
and no beanie.

358
00:25:25,947 --> 00:25:29,144
I believe that's two points from Great Falls,
Mr. Nelson.

359
00:25:29,387 --> 00:25:31,184
Tell you what, Vande-cramp...

360
00:25:31,507 --> 00:25:34,180
what if I took his beanie...

361
00:25:34,267 --> 00:25:36,906
and put it on my weenie?

362
00:25:36,987 --> 00:25:40,900
How do you like that Vande-cramp?
It's on my head, right?

363
00:25:41,067 --> 00:25:43,217
Make it five points from Great Falls.

364
00:25:43,387 --> 00:25:44,615
Five points.

365
00:25:44,707 --> 00:25:47,744
Man, this place sucks donkey ass.

366
00:25:52,627 --> 00:25:54,299
Put your beanie on, Son.

367
00:25:59,907 --> 00:26:01,784
Five points.

368
00:26:24,187 --> 00:26:26,382
Stay still. Stop moving.

369
00:26:26,467 --> 00:26:28,139
He ain't going nowhere now.

370
00:26:28,227 --> 00:26:31,424
This isn't your world. This is our
world, and we don't want you in it.

371
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:33,657
You already cost us
five points in the standings.

372
00:26:33,747 --> 00:26:35,465
We can't have that.

373
00:26:35,707 --> 00:26:37,345
Set the man up with his beanie.

374
00:26:44,787 --> 00:26:46,618
Now you're representing, fool.

375
00:26:46,707 --> 00:26:47,935
And this toothpaste...

376
00:26:48,027 --> 00:26:50,621
this will make up
for the pepper spray, asshole.

377
00:27:03,947 --> 00:27:05,426
Oh, shit.

378
00:27:06,107 --> 00:27:08,416
I'll get the paint thinner
from maintenance.

379
00:27:09,947 --> 00:27:11,266
Animals.

380
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:25,266
Matt, you were sent here...

381
00:27:25,667 --> 00:27:27,066
to make a change.

382
00:27:27,227 --> 00:27:30,822
And, so far, you've only had
your sinuses sanitized. So...

383
00:27:31,187 --> 00:27:33,496
I think it's time to try a new approach.

384
00:27:33,947 --> 00:27:35,665
Make some friends.

385
00:27:37,347 --> 00:27:39,099
Earn their trust.

386
00:27:41,267 --> 00:27:43,462
Why would I want to earn their trust?

387
00:27:46,587 --> 00:27:48,066
Good.

388
00:27:52,027 --> 00:27:54,018
Welcome to Stifler-vision.

389
00:27:54,107 --> 00:27:56,496
I think there's
a cymbal class at 1:00.

390
00:27:56,667 --> 00:27:57,816
I hate that.

391
00:27:57,907 --> 00:28:00,023
Yeah, but it's better than
the bass drum relay.

392
00:28:00,107 --> 00:28:01,301
Yeah, that's true.

393
00:28:05,667 --> 00:28:07,783
Yours look totally fantastic.

394
00:28:07,867 --> 00:28:10,984
Two for the price of one. 
My left one's bigger, see?

395
00:28:11,067 --> 00:28:13,865
Yeah, mine, too, baby.
They can totally fix that.

396
00:28:13,947 --> 00:28:15,619
No!
Want to see?

397
00:28:15,707 --> 00:28:18,175
I used to be... 
Lens fog. No!

398
00:28:29,027 --> 00:28:32,736
What is that thing, butt weasel?
Yeah, it's the KR3, baby.

399
00:28:32,827 --> 00:28:36,342
The Kaplowitz Remote Robotic Rover.
And you are so busted.

400
00:28:36,427 --> 00:28:39,863
- Hey, Oscar, somebody call the Macro.
- Dude, please, shut up.

401
00:28:39,947 --> 00:28:43,542
Pull your panties out of your ass.
I can help you with that chick.

402
00:28:47,187 --> 00:28:48,222
What chick?

403
00:28:48,307 --> 00:28:50,696
Dude, the one with all the tattoos.
The Tubanator.

404
00:28:50,787 --> 00:28:52,186
Her name is Chloe.

405
00:28:52,787 --> 00:28:56,018
Come on, man. I can help.
I'm the Stiffmeister.

406
00:28:56,107 --> 00:28:58,780
- Master of love and romance.
- Bullshit.

407
00:28:58,947 --> 00:29:03,225
I nailed three cheerleaders in one week
on spring break. College cheerleaders.

408
00:29:13,307 --> 00:29:15,696
And I know why your camera spritzed out.

409
00:29:18,307 --> 00:29:20,184
Dude, this thing is awesome.

410
00:29:20,747 --> 00:29:23,705
- You ever use this to look up chicks' skirts?
- No.

411
00:29:23,787 --> 00:29:26,062
But I did use it to win
the State Science Fair last year.

412
00:29:26,147 --> 00:29:28,342
And I'm hoping it gets me into MIT next fall.

413
00:29:28,427 --> 00:29:30,383
I really want to work for NASA.

414
00:29:30,587 --> 00:29:32,976
National Anal Sex Association?

415
00:29:33,187 --> 00:29:34,859
No it's Space...

416
00:29:35,627 --> 00:29:40,098
- There's an Anal Sex Association?
- Oh, yeah, but you've got to be a pro.

417
00:29:41,627 --> 00:29:43,697
Wait, there's a Space Association?

418
00:29:45,187 --> 00:29:47,064
You were supposed to use this.

419
00:29:48,307 --> 00:29:52,346
- See, it's got an anti-fog lens. Duh.
- Yeah, good.

420
00:29:53,387 --> 00:29:58,063
- Can the robot record?
- All right, so, what are your intentions?

421
00:29:59,467 --> 00:30:01,856
With the video, I mean. What are you doing?

422
00:30:01,947 --> 00:30:03,426
Oh, it's just for fun.

423
00:30:03,707 --> 00:30:07,017
I mean, who doesn't like to look
at hot naked chicks, right?

424
00:30:08,427 --> 00:30:10,895
Keep it between us, and I'll let you watch.

425
00:30:11,187 --> 00:30:14,657
Plus, I'll have you giving Chloe
the pelvic noogie inside a week.

426
00:30:15,867 --> 00:30:17,778
Hey, Stifler. Phone.

427
00:30:17,947 --> 00:30:19,699
We're in Detroit!

428
00:30:20,307 --> 00:30:22,901
Locked into sweet Brazilian rum.

429
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,626
I'm fucking fubar, man!

430
00:30:25,707 --> 00:30:29,859
I sent you rum today.
Could come in handy in Dorksville.

431
00:30:29,947 --> 00:30:31,539
This place blows.

432
00:30:32,707 --> 00:30:34,345
Hey, my roommate, Dr. Robot...

433
00:30:34,427 --> 00:30:36,497
busted me taping some college chicks
in the shower.

434
00:30:36,587 --> 00:30:38,623
So now I have to be all nice to him and shit.

435
00:30:38,707 --> 00:30:41,938
And I'm not getting any good footage
'cause these fucking bandees hate me.

436
00:30:43,587 --> 00:30:45,703
Think of it
like trying to hook up with a virgin.

437
00:30:45,787 --> 00:30:49,223
Act like you give a shit about them
until they bring you into the good stuff.

438
00:30:49,307 --> 00:30:51,104
Earn their trust?

439
00:30:51,707 --> 00:30:53,584
Dude, that could work.

440
00:30:53,707 --> 00:30:56,141
I'll be an undercover bandee fucker.

441
00:30:57,027 --> 00:31:00,383
Hello, everyone.
Isn't it a peachy day here at Band Camp?

442
00:31:00,587 --> 00:31:04,296
Band buds. How's it going? Yo.

443
00:31:05,027 --> 00:31:08,815
Hey, I just want to say thanks
for the little wakeup call. You kidders.

444
00:31:09,907 --> 00:31:12,865
Hey, I can finally hear
the music calling me, okay?

445
00:31:14,067 --> 00:31:16,786
There. Hear it? Yeah. Me, too.

446
00:31:17,027 --> 00:31:21,498
So I'm a totally new man, and... By the way,
you both look great in pantyhose.

447
00:31:31,467 --> 00:31:34,618
- What are you doing?
- Awaiting my marching lesson, ma'am.

448
00:31:34,707 --> 00:31:37,062
Look, Matt, I really don't have time for this
right now.

449
00:31:37,147 --> 00:31:40,537
No, look, I figure I'm here,
I might as well make the best of it.

450
00:31:40,627 --> 00:31:43,903
Matt, marching's hard, okay?
It's not like throwing some football.

451
00:31:43,987 --> 00:31:47,502
- Oh, you ever thrown into double coverage?
- You ever high-stepped in double time?

452
00:31:47,587 --> 00:31:50,943
Yes, ma'am, the time the cops chased us
across Koreno's Creek.

453
00:31:51,547 --> 00:31:54,300
And you got so scared, you cried.

454
00:31:55,027 --> 00:31:58,940
- I had allergies.
- It was winter, Mattie.

455
00:31:59,907 --> 00:32:03,217
Well, if you don't teach me to march,
I might just cry again.

456
00:32:06,667 --> 00:32:07,782
Fine.

457
00:32:08,067 --> 00:32:11,946
Left foot on one and three,
right foot on two and four.

458
00:32:12,027 --> 00:32:13,506
You have to do math?

459
00:32:21,747 --> 00:32:25,501
One, two, three, middle.
One, two, three, line.

460
00:32:25,587 --> 00:32:27,703
Right foot on four.

461
00:32:29,867 --> 00:32:32,301
- Keep your step size even.
- My what?

462
00:32:33,787 --> 00:32:37,177
All right, there we go, little buddy. 
I'm gonna fix you up good.

463
00:32:38,587 --> 00:32:43,217
Any girl that knows how to play a tuba,
she can do things. That's what Stifler says.

464
00:32:43,307 --> 00:32:45,821
I don't know what it means,
but it's got to be good.

465
00:32:45,907 --> 00:32:47,101
You're good to go.

466
00:32:47,187 --> 00:32:48,666
Let's go find Chloe.

467
00:33:00,947 --> 00:33:02,096
Holy shit.

468
00:33:03,307 --> 00:33:06,458
What the hell? Who's doing this?

469
00:33:08,707 --> 00:33:09,776
Take it.

470
00:33:09,867 --> 00:33:10,902
It's okay.

471
00:33:20,187 --> 00:33:23,657
- Thanks, little creepy machine. 
- You're welcome...

472
00:33:24,027 --> 00:33:25,665
beautiful lady.

473
00:33:40,347 --> 00:33:44,465
With my right, with my right,
but I can also do it with my left, with my left.

474
00:33:47,827 --> 00:33:48,862
Bootie.

475
00:33:50,227 --> 00:33:51,296
Good game.

476
00:33:57,267 --> 00:33:59,019
You just touched my bootie.

477
00:34:05,787 --> 00:34:08,096
- What's that?
- Your instrument.

478
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:10,265
That's fucking gay.

479
00:34:11,267 --> 00:34:13,303
- I mean lame.
- Good.

480
00:34:14,067 --> 00:34:16,820
Now, there are two positions.

481
00:34:17,427 --> 00:34:21,420
Carrying position, like this,
and playing position, like this.

482
00:34:21,587 --> 00:34:23,225
Now when I call, "horns up"...

483
00:34:23,307 --> 00:34:25,298
you're gonna move your instrument out,
and then...

484
00:34:25,387 --> 00:34:26,979
Hello, losers.

485
00:34:27,147 --> 00:34:30,776
Matt. Oh, my God. Matt, I am so sorry.

486
00:34:30,867 --> 00:34:33,017
- I think I bit a hole in my tongue.
- Oh, let me see.

487
00:34:33,107 --> 00:34:35,541
No, no hole.
On today's...

488
00:34:35,627 --> 00:34:38,824
episode wasting time on lost causes.

489
00:34:39,507 --> 00:34:43,466
Speaking of which, I understand you
composed the music to your show, Elyse...

490
00:34:43,547 --> 00:34:45,105
if you call that music.

491
00:34:45,187 --> 00:34:47,542
Yeah. That's right. I did.

492
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:49,743
And who'd your daddy hire
to compose yours?

493
00:34:49,827 --> 00:34:54,582
I'm just giving you fair warning, cupcake.
Robards Scholarship is mine.

494
00:34:55,067 --> 00:34:56,420
Like you need it.

495
00:34:56,707 --> 00:34:59,585
It's not a matter of need.
It's a matter of want.

496
00:34:59,867 --> 00:35:03,143
- Yeah, I get what I want.
- Why don't you shut the fuck up?

497
00:35:03,227 --> 00:35:04,421
Matt, don't.

498
00:35:05,427 --> 00:35:08,100
- What are you going to do?
- Kick your ass.

499
00:35:08,267 --> 00:35:09,985
- Are you challenging me?
- No.

500
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:13,298
- Yeah, what if I am?
- No, Brandon, that is not what he's doing.

501
00:35:13,387 --> 00:35:16,106
I accept. Amphitheatre, 5:00.

502
00:35:16,467 --> 00:35:19,220
It's been three years
since I've been challenged.

503
00:35:19,467 --> 00:35:21,264
We got a challenge.

504
00:35:23,867 --> 00:35:26,176
I look forward to reminding people why.

505
00:35:26,947 --> 00:35:28,380
East Great Falls.

506
00:35:28,667 --> 00:35:30,703
I'll see you there, asshole.

507
00:35:32,507 --> 00:35:36,182
- Do you know what you just did?
- Doesn't matter. He's going down.

508
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:38,827
Matt, you challenged him to a duel.

509
00:35:39,107 --> 00:35:40,256
With swords?

510
00:35:40,867 --> 00:35:44,542
No, you idiot.
You each get on stage and perform.

511
00:35:44,627 --> 00:35:46,583
And the crowd decides who wins.

512
00:35:47,067 --> 00:35:48,898
Can't we just do keg stands?

513
00:35:49,467 --> 00:35:53,699
Matt, this is serious, okay?
Beechwood gets five points if he wins...

514
00:35:53,787 --> 00:35:56,938
which, you know, he will
because he plays an instrument.

515
00:35:57,147 --> 00:35:58,865
Well, so do I.

516
00:35:59,387 --> 00:36:02,060
Let the Tall Oaks
Battle Royale begin.

517
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:05,380
The prize is five points towards the cup.

518
00:36:06,267 --> 00:36:08,178
Okay, Brandon, you're up first.

519
00:36:50,347 --> 00:36:51,575
Come on!

520
00:36:53,827 --> 00:36:56,261
Suck on that, bitch.

521
00:36:57,267 --> 00:36:58,495
Lame.

522
00:36:59,227 --> 00:37:00,740
This is so embarrassing.

523
00:37:00,827 --> 00:37:02,021
Okay, Brandon.

524
00:37:02,107 --> 00:37:03,665
Now you show him, Brandon.

525
00:37:20,867 --> 00:37:22,016
Take that!

526
00:37:33,187 --> 00:37:35,860
Well, seems this contest is over.

527
00:37:36,507 --> 00:37:38,782
Figures. We just lost five points.

528
00:37:41,307 --> 00:37:44,185
And the winner by forfeit is...

529
00:37:46,587 --> 00:37:48,179
But I know it's not his fault...

530
00:38:10,467 --> 00:38:12,139
You don't know the words.

531
00:38:33,027 --> 00:38:34,540
He should shave that.

532
00:38:37,267 --> 00:38:38,859
East Great Falls!

533
00:38:39,427 --> 00:38:41,179
East Great Falls!

534
00:38:41,467 --> 00:38:43,298
East Great Falls!

535
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:45,505
East Great Falls!

536
00:38:48,547 --> 00:38:51,015
Okay, five points to Great Falls.

537
00:38:52,827 --> 00:38:54,738
All right, Great Falls!

538
00:38:57,027 --> 00:38:59,097
East Great Falls!

539
00:39:01,507 --> 00:39:02,337
East Great Falls!

540
00:39:03,347 --> 00:39:05,383
East Great Falls!

541
00:39:05,467 --> 00:39:07,378
East Great Falls!

542
00:39:08,907 --> 00:39:10,545
Hey, hey...

543
00:39:10,627 --> 00:39:12,618
- Hey.
- What?

544
00:39:12,707 --> 00:39:15,175
- Are you really Scottish?
- Fuck, no.

545
00:39:16,147 --> 00:39:17,466
My mum made me learn an instrument.

546
00:39:17,547 --> 00:39:19,344
That's the most annoying one
I could think of.

547
00:39:19,427 --> 00:39:23,056
I think you were just born
to squeeze sacks and blow pipes, Stifler.

548
00:39:23,267 --> 00:39:24,541
Hey, Oscar.

549
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:31,627
How many other Oscars
do you know? Go!

550
00:39:33,907 --> 00:39:36,216
- What's up?
- Your drum line sounds pretty tight.

551
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:37,342
Oh, thanks.

552
00:39:37,427 --> 00:39:39,383
You let me know
if you want to learn some new moves.

553
00:39:39,587 --> 00:39:40,656
Really?

554
00:39:40,747 --> 00:39:43,341
- He's gonna screw it up.
- He's definitely gonna screw it up.

555
00:39:44,827 --> 00:39:48,900
- Thanks for winning those points back.
- I lost them. I had to get them back.

556
00:39:49,707 --> 00:39:52,665
Hey, guys,
Sheree's gonna show me some moves.

557
00:39:53,187 --> 00:39:54,222
Hey, gang...

558
00:39:54,307 --> 00:39:58,505
just a little reminder that as the battle
for the cup heats up, let's try to remember...

559
00:39:59,667 --> 00:40:03,057
to keep up that Tall Oaks spirit of fair play
and friendly competition.

560
00:40:03,827 --> 00:40:06,102
We'll have enough spit for a six-pack.

561
00:40:09,227 --> 00:40:12,060
- Yeah, baby, you did me proud, son.
- Thanks, J. Lo.

562
00:40:12,147 --> 00:40:13,546
It's cool. Big O?

563
00:40:13,907 --> 00:40:16,785
Quite a little show you put on
yesterday, Stifler.

564
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:19,666
You know,
these plebes think you're some kind of hero.

565
00:40:19,747 --> 00:40:21,897
I don't know what a plebe is, Vande-creep.

566
00:40:21,987 --> 00:40:25,059
Didn't anybody tell you not to mess
with the big dog while he's eating?

567
00:40:25,147 --> 00:40:27,786
It's mine, jerk-wad.
Now will you give it back?

568
00:40:29,187 --> 00:40:32,304
- Dildos.
- This is still my camp, asshole.

569
00:40:32,547 --> 00:40:34,981
- You're going down.
- No, I'm not.

570
00:40:35,067 --> 00:40:36,136
But your mum did last night.

571
00:40:36,227 --> 00:40:39,424
Did she play the trumpet?
Because she has really strong lips.

572
00:40:39,667 --> 00:40:40,895
That's right.

573
00:40:55,947 --> 00:40:57,062
Yummy.

574
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:02,578
That's what I'm talking about.

575
00:41:03,707 --> 00:41:06,540
- What happened this time, Claire?
- Well, I was working on my solo...

576
00:41:06,627 --> 00:41:08,026
and I hurt myself.

577
00:41:08,867 --> 00:41:10,619
I've been fucking poisoned.

578
00:41:11,867 --> 00:41:14,461
Ipecac is a natural herbal extract...

579
00:41:14,547 --> 00:41:17,459
that triggers the regurgitation reflex.

580
00:41:21,627 --> 00:41:24,221
Whatever's in there
should be out soon enough.

581
00:41:24,507 --> 00:41:26,179
Like him, if we're lucky.

582
00:41:28,107 --> 00:41:31,577
Well, I'm pretty sure
it's probably just something...

583
00:41:31,907 --> 00:41:36,105
you had for lunch, you know? I've got
the same problem. Very sensitive stomach.

584
00:41:36,707 --> 00:41:39,983
I was at a banquet once.
On the same plate, if you can believe it...

585
00:41:40,067 --> 00:41:45,061
they had creamed venison, squid fritters,
and jellied pork.

586
00:41:50,467 --> 00:41:51,536
What?

587
00:42:02,307 --> 00:42:04,901
- Hey, what's up, crust bucket?
- Come here, dude. Check this out.

588
00:42:04,987 --> 00:42:08,502
So, this afternoon, while the counselors
were practicing for the talent show...

589
00:42:08,587 --> 00:42:11,055
I faked an asthma attack,
and I changed both of the cameras.

590
00:42:11,147 --> 00:42:13,707
It's their talent show routine, au naturel.

591
00:42:14,067 --> 00:42:16,661
Dude, you filthy little cyberfucker. Shit.

592
00:42:17,467 --> 00:42:21,779
- Hey, I thought we were just going to watch.
- Exactly, we may want to watch it again.

593
00:42:26,867 --> 00:42:31,543
Hey, so, I took your advice about Chloe.
I used the Rover to deliver a soda.

594
00:42:32,107 --> 00:42:35,782
- That was your cool, crazy idea?
- Yeah, I think she actually liked it.

595
00:42:35,867 --> 00:42:38,779
- Yeah, that sounds gay.
- It's not gay.

596
00:42:40,267 --> 00:42:43,020
Anyway, there's
this bonfire-slushee party tonight...

597
00:42:43,107 --> 00:42:46,224
and I really need to know Step Two
in the Stiffmeister plan.

598
00:42:46,307 --> 00:42:49,743
Slushee party. Really.

599
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:51,580
Special delivery.

600
00:42:51,707 --> 00:42:53,379
Prepare to jam with the bearded clam.

601
00:42:54,587 --> 00:42:56,100
Get ready to cuddle the love puddle.

602
00:42:56,187 --> 00:42:59,384
The time has come for Dr. Robot to get laid.

603
00:42:59,587 --> 00:43:00,622
Get laid?

604
00:43:00,787 --> 00:43:03,347
I told you, trust the Stiffmeister.

605
00:43:03,587 --> 00:43:06,226
Meister means "master" in German.

606
00:43:07,107 --> 00:43:11,259
Get her drunk? That's the secret
of the ages? That's Step Number Two?

607
00:43:11,347 --> 00:43:16,102
No, actually, it's Step Four. You don't have
the balls for Two or the tongue for Three.

608
00:43:16,267 --> 00:43:17,700
I've got the balls.

609
00:43:18,227 --> 00:43:20,661
Hey, you haven't heard Step Five yet.

610
00:43:24,307 --> 00:43:27,822
Born to be wild

611
00:43:31,347 --> 00:43:34,862
Well, I'm hot blooded
Check it and see

612
00:43:35,227 --> 00:43:38,856
I've got a fever of 103

613
00:43:38,947 --> 00:43:41,620
Come on baby
Do you do more than dance?

614
00:43:43,347 --> 00:43:46,020
- This is some good shit.
- Don't enjoy it too much.

615
00:43:46,107 --> 00:43:49,417
- We have a big practice tomorrow, you guys.
- Relax, Leesy.

616
00:43:49,827 --> 00:43:52,899
Suckle the tender fruits
of Band Camp with your friends.

617
00:43:53,027 --> 00:43:56,656
Come on, Elyse. Cut loose a little bit.
Have some fun.

618
00:43:56,747 --> 00:43:58,021
I am having fun.

619
00:43:58,107 --> 00:44:00,985
Hey, horn dog, let's go get
some more of these before they run out.

620
00:44:01,067 --> 00:44:03,376
- All right.
- Horn dog?

621
00:44:03,467 --> 00:44:07,824
Yeah, it's his nickname. Dude will stick
his dick into anything. It's unnatural.

622
00:44:08,787 --> 00:44:12,496
Check it, dawg. This one time
at Band Camp, I fucked an oboe.

623
00:44:13,507 --> 00:44:15,782
- Really?
- Blow in it for a while...

624
00:44:15,867 --> 00:44:20,304
get that wood nice and warm,
slap on some valve oil and go to town, yo.

625
00:44:20,507 --> 00:44:22,577
Hey, maybe you should try a flute.

626
00:44:27,027 --> 00:44:29,416
Now's a good time
to teach you those moves.

627
00:44:29,507 --> 00:44:30,496
Really?

628
00:44:35,907 --> 00:44:37,022
What?

629
00:44:50,907 --> 00:44:52,226
I know what you're doing.

630
00:44:52,307 --> 00:44:56,266
- You do?
- It's what you always do. You're a fake.

631
00:44:56,507 --> 00:44:59,499
You do whatever it takes
to be the centre of attention.

632
00:44:59,587 --> 00:45:03,296
Just like when we were kids,
around me, you were regular old Matt...

633
00:45:03,627 --> 00:45:06,858
but around Steve and his friends,
you were the Stiffmeister.

634
00:45:07,947 --> 00:45:09,539
Who're you going to be tonight?

635
00:45:09,627 --> 00:45:11,185
Hey, cheese dick...

636
00:45:11,267 --> 00:45:15,545
why don't you quit being such a fucking
taint licker, and get me another slushee.

637
00:45:15,627 --> 00:45:17,504
Fucking puss monkey.

638
00:45:25,027 --> 00:45:27,495
You know what?
I am going to have some fun.

639
00:45:35,187 --> 00:45:38,179
Fucking hoes, man. I don't get that shit.

640
00:45:38,267 --> 00:45:42,021
I mean, right now, Oscar's off in the woods
tapping that counselor biatch, Sheree.

641
00:45:42,107 --> 00:45:44,780
- What's up with that?
- That cock spring is getting laid?

642
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:47,745
True that. And here we are,
the two dopest homeboys in camp...

643
00:45:47,827 --> 00:45:51,945
and we ain't got no prospects
for our palm pilots. That's fucked up, dawg.

644
00:45:52,307 --> 00:45:54,263
Dude, I gotta see this.

645
00:45:57,747 --> 00:45:59,578
Use your hips more.
Hips, like that?

646
00:45:59,667 --> 00:46:03,421
Yeah, now faster. Yeah. Like that.
A circle. Like that.

647
00:46:03,507 --> 00:46:07,500
Crikey! The
alpha female has chosen an unlikely mate.

648
00:46:07,587 --> 00:46:10,101
Will he survive this dangerous encounter...

649
00:46:10,347 --> 00:46:14,579
or will she satisfy her primal needs
and then devour him for dinner?

650
00:46:14,867 --> 00:46:16,425
Stay tuned.

651
00:46:16,827 --> 00:46:20,536
I'm sorry. I'm really no good
at this stuff.

652
00:46:20,627 --> 00:46:22,618
Relax. You're doing fine.

653
00:46:25,867 --> 00:46:27,300
This sucks.

654
00:46:27,627 --> 00:46:30,061
How's that feel? Oscar.

655
00:46:30,627 --> 00:46:32,697
Is that your drumstick poking me?

656
00:46:33,827 --> 00:46:35,704
I don't have my drumsticks.

657
00:46:35,787 --> 00:46:38,460
Are you standing up for me again, Oscar?

658
00:46:38,987 --> 00:46:40,625
It's getting hot.

659
00:46:40,907 --> 00:46:43,705
Smack my ass and call me cowboy.

660
00:46:44,467 --> 00:46:46,583
Hello, Double-D Sheree.

661
00:46:47,027 --> 00:46:48,699
Hips. Hips.

662
00:46:48,947 --> 00:46:50,539
- Use your hips.
- Oh, yeah, hips.

663
00:46:50,627 --> 00:46:52,379
And step, and...

664
00:46:55,467 --> 00:46:56,536
Who knew?

665
00:46:57,547 --> 00:46:58,866
Wow.

666
00:47:01,707 --> 00:47:04,016
Yo, we at Tall Oaks
Sipping on juice

667
00:47:04,107 --> 00:47:06,302
Got horns, trumpets
Rhythm and flutes

668
00:47:06,387 --> 00:47:08,617
Great Falls laying it down

669
00:47:08,707 --> 00:47:11,141
Gonna ride fucking Beechwood
out of the town

670
00:47:11,227 --> 00:47:13,502
J.C., what, rocking the bunch

671
00:47:13,587 --> 00:47:16,545
All tripped out on the fucking fruit punch

672
00:47:19,827 --> 00:47:23,058
- I just want to be respectful. 
- Oh, that's sweet.

673
00:47:23,307 --> 00:47:25,741
The only person who's gonna get laid
around here.

674
00:47:34,547 --> 00:47:36,503
Hello, oboe.

675
00:47:52,707 --> 00:47:54,379
This is so cool.

676
00:47:55,867 --> 00:48:00,019
I hope I didn't scare you
with the Rover and the soda.

677
00:48:00,147 --> 00:48:02,217
No, man, it was cute.

678
00:48:02,907 --> 00:48:06,343
Nobody's ever been that sweet to me
in my whole life.

679
00:48:06,907 --> 00:48:08,420
Plus, to be honest...

680
00:48:08,827 --> 00:48:11,819
metal really turns me on.

681
00:48:37,507 --> 00:48:39,577
Man, the shit's stuck.

682
00:49:03,107 --> 00:49:05,462
- Turn off the lights.
- Damn, gangsta.

683
00:49:05,587 --> 00:49:08,147
- I was just fucking with you, dawg!
- You... It's stuck.

684
00:49:08,227 --> 00:49:10,536
- Shit, you want help?
- Don't touch me.

685
00:49:12,027 --> 00:49:13,062
Come on.

686
00:49:13,787 --> 00:49:15,300
Maybe you should blow on it.

687
00:49:15,387 --> 00:49:17,025
Maybe you should blow on it
and I'll pull.

688
00:49:17,107 --> 00:49:19,177
Hell, no. Jimmy ain't putting his lips
on that thing.

689
00:49:19,267 --> 00:49:20,666
Jimmy should be a team player.

690
00:49:20,747 --> 00:49:22,897
Try and relax, dawg.
Not so hard.

691
00:49:22,987 --> 00:49:24,500
Oh, my God!

692
00:49:31,187 --> 00:49:34,543
- I was just trying to help him get it off, yo.
- Dude, shut up.

693
00:49:34,627 --> 00:49:35,696
Whatever.

694
00:49:35,787 --> 00:49:37,743
He had an allergic reaction to the valve oil.

695
00:49:37,827 --> 00:49:40,387
The swelling should go down
in a few minutes.

696
00:49:40,627 --> 00:49:44,586
These kinds of things would never happen
with our old Macro.

697
00:50:04,747 --> 00:50:07,466
We didn't have MTV when I was growing up.

698
00:50:08,747 --> 00:50:11,215
So maybe it's the over-stimulated times...

699
00:50:11,307 --> 00:50:15,266
that we live in
that causes young men to stick their...

700
00:50:15,947 --> 00:50:18,700
instruments in such odd places.

701
00:50:20,547 --> 00:50:22,060
I knew a certain young man once...

702
00:50:22,147 --> 00:50:25,298
who actually engaged in sexual congress
with an apple pie.

703
00:50:25,467 --> 00:50:27,264
And he turned out just fine.

704
00:50:27,787 --> 00:50:30,585
So, you're perfectly normal...

705
00:50:31,667 --> 00:50:33,180
as these things go.

706
00:50:50,787 --> 00:50:53,779
- Are you okay?
- Oh, yeah.

707
00:50:53,867 --> 00:50:58,179
I'm so drunk right now.
I'm probably going to forget about you...

708
00:50:59,587 --> 00:51:01,578
porking an oboe.

709
00:51:10,307 --> 00:51:11,979
I have six piercings.

710
00:51:13,387 --> 00:51:15,821
That doesn't include the ones on my face.

711
00:51:28,787 --> 00:51:30,140
Two right here...

712
00:51:32,427 --> 00:51:35,339
and four down here.

713
00:51:46,587 --> 00:51:48,464
Haven't seen that in a while.

714
00:51:48,827 --> 00:51:53,662
Yeah, well, no time for dance.
It's all about band, band, band.

715
00:51:53,747 --> 00:51:55,658
No, I was talking about you having fun.

716
00:51:55,747 --> 00:51:59,137
- I have fun. I have fun all the time.
- Yeah.

717
00:51:59,227 --> 00:52:01,821
I just get stressed out, you know. I mean...

718
00:52:02,467 --> 00:52:04,583
we graduate next year, and I don't know.

719
00:52:04,667 --> 00:52:06,623
I mean, I don't really talk about it
all that much...

720
00:52:06,707 --> 00:52:09,540
because the cup is, like,
a team thing, and...

721
00:52:09,627 --> 00:52:12,619
But winning the Robards Scholarship,
I mean, that is like...

722
00:52:12,707 --> 00:52:14,345
my future, you know? And...

723
00:52:15,267 --> 00:52:17,986
Dr. Choi is coming. I mean...

724
00:52:18,147 --> 00:52:21,457
you don't understand. She's like famous...

725
00:52:21,907 --> 00:52:24,785
like holy-shit famous.
And, sometimes, I just...

726
00:52:25,787 --> 00:52:27,425
I get really stressed out...

727
00:52:27,507 --> 00:52:31,182
and I calm myself down
by going off and playing on my Picardo.

728
00:52:31,867 --> 00:52:34,461
Wait, you have... Picardo?

729
00:52:34,627 --> 00:52:37,095
It's just a cheapie, but I lost it.

730
00:52:37,427 --> 00:52:40,499
- Wait, if I somehow found this Picard thing...
- You found it?

731
00:52:40,747 --> 00:52:42,578
- Maybe.
- Give it back.

732
00:52:42,867 --> 00:52:44,346
If you let me watch.

733
00:52:45,267 --> 00:52:48,179
Okay, but it takes me a while to warm up.

734
00:52:48,267 --> 00:52:50,622
I have all the time in the world.

735
00:52:53,107 --> 00:52:54,142
Figures.

736
00:52:55,947 --> 00:52:58,415
But I'm going to have to be really drunk.

737
00:52:59,267 --> 00:53:02,464
I mean really drunk. Really drunk.

738
00:53:03,347 --> 00:53:04,336
Yes.

739
00:53:04,907 --> 00:53:06,340
Beat it, jerk off.

740
00:53:24,667 --> 00:53:26,897
Okay, people, let's take a break.

741
00:53:30,187 --> 00:53:32,223
We're all a little sluggish today.

742
00:53:33,947 --> 00:53:35,505
Man, we suck.

743
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:38,977
Man, one night of fun was not worth
losing a whole day of practice.

744
00:53:42,547 --> 00:53:43,980
Give me this thing.

745
00:53:44,747 --> 00:53:47,215
All right, listen up,
you lazy bunch of lip shits.

746
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:49,184
Those Beechwood plebes
aren't taking breaks.

747
00:53:49,267 --> 00:53:52,065
We want to win this thing,
we've gotta bust our asses.

748
00:53:52,387 --> 00:53:54,423
Come on, bitches. Back to work.

749
00:53:54,507 --> 00:53:57,180
- Matt, that's my job.
- Grab your cocks and move your socks.

750
00:53:57,267 --> 00:53:59,303
We're at war here, people, war!

751
00:53:59,387 --> 00:54:02,618
Show some tits. Grow some balls. 
Hey, keep that thing warm for me.

752
00:54:02,707 --> 00:54:06,666
All right, now. What, you want to let
Beechwood tittie-fuck us? I didn't think so.

753
00:54:06,747 --> 00:54:08,021
All right, Tall Oakers...

754
00:54:08,107 --> 00:54:11,019
we're in our final week. 
Time to put on our game faces.

755
00:54:11,107 --> 00:54:14,144
And time to strap yourselves in
for a bumpy ride.

756
00:54:14,227 --> 00:54:16,104
I want the oboe, clarinet, black thingies...

757
00:54:16,187 --> 00:54:18,860
and we've got the rhythm section
in a full-on blitz.

758
00:54:18,947 --> 00:54:21,017
- Are you with me, bandees?
- Yeah!

759
00:54:21,107 --> 00:54:23,780
Competition for the Tall Oaks Cup
is really heating up.

760
00:54:27,307 --> 00:54:28,740
Beechwood wins.

761
00:54:30,867 --> 00:54:31,856
Whatever.

762
00:54:31,947 --> 00:54:33,221
I told you, you should let me steer.

763
00:54:33,307 --> 00:54:34,899
Take that bitch home, man.

764
00:54:35,267 --> 00:54:39,465
Drive it in. Hey, you, fuck face,
I don't even know where to start with you.

765
00:54:46,027 --> 00:54:49,497
Beechwood leads. 
Great Falls and Lloyd are tied for second.

766
00:54:49,587 --> 00:54:51,578
Beechwood licks nuts. Hut!

767
00:54:59,787 --> 00:55:01,937
Victory, East Great Falls.

768
00:55:05,187 --> 00:55:07,223
Right foot on line.

769
00:55:08,907 --> 00:55:10,863
Jimmy, you fucking lotion lover.

770
00:55:17,747 --> 00:55:20,261
East Great Falls by four points.

771
00:55:29,507 --> 00:55:31,259
Hey, butt pirates ahoy.

772
00:55:32,147 --> 00:55:35,503
Your little band
may be leading in the competition, Stifler...

773
00:55:36,867 --> 00:55:39,381
but make sure to let us know
if you get thirsty.

774
00:55:39,467 --> 00:55:41,617
Yeah, 'cause there's plenty of this.

775
00:55:46,747 --> 00:55:50,535
That's funny for you dorks.
Yeah, it is, isn't it? Yeah.

776
00:55:50,747 --> 00:55:53,261
Man, screw that challenge.
I'm just gonna kick his ass.

777
00:55:53,347 --> 00:55:55,417
No, wait. I've got a better idea...

778
00:55:56,307 --> 00:55:58,263
if you think you're man enough.

779
00:56:09,827 --> 00:56:10,816
Yes.

780
00:56:10,907 --> 00:56:13,944
- Hey, you sure you can do this?
- Hey, born to be a porn star, baby.

781
00:56:14,027 --> 00:56:15,460
Delivery on demand.

782
00:56:16,507 --> 00:56:19,419
When I get back,
I'll be a million Stiflers lighter.

783
00:56:38,707 --> 00:56:40,663
Brandon, I think you're
a really good drummer, so...

784
00:56:40,747 --> 00:56:41,782
Excuse me.

785
00:56:53,547 --> 00:56:54,821
Hey, guys...

786
00:56:54,907 --> 00:56:58,502
don't forget your sunscreen.
Your bodies are your instruments.

787
00:56:58,587 --> 00:57:00,578
Yeah, you don't want to be
chapped for your solos.

788
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:02,897
No, we don't. Bye now.

789
00:57:07,947 --> 00:57:10,097
What is that, 30? It's really thick.

790
00:57:20,027 --> 00:57:21,858
How's that taste, Vande-cock?

791
00:57:22,427 --> 00:57:24,577
Good, huh? Warm and salty? Yeah.

792
00:57:24,667 --> 00:57:28,296
It's a cum-pletely new formula.
100% Stiffy juice...

793
00:57:28,387 --> 00:57:30,423
S.P.F. 69.

794
00:57:36,907 --> 00:57:38,101
Suck on that.

795
00:57:39,187 --> 00:57:40,745
- Yeah.
- Stop, man.

796
00:57:40,827 --> 00:57:42,465
- Yeah.
- Ernie.

797
00:57:42,547 --> 00:57:43,821
- Yeah.
- Ernie.

798
00:57:52,827 --> 00:57:55,341
What you had before
was way better than this.

799
00:57:55,427 --> 00:57:59,306
This sounds like
your overactive honor-society brain.

800
00:57:59,747 --> 00:58:03,376
Instead of your nasty, wet...

801
00:58:04,187 --> 00:58:05,620
dirty-girl panties.

802
00:58:06,507 --> 00:58:08,418
It should be more spontaneous.

803
00:58:11,267 --> 00:58:12,541
Stop.

804
00:58:12,627 --> 00:58:15,346
Maybe you should hang out
with your friend Matt a little bit more.

805
00:58:15,427 --> 00:58:16,416
Yeah, right.

806
00:58:16,507 --> 00:58:19,943
I know he's a dick and everything,
but he's also got one.

807
00:58:20,067 --> 00:58:24,140
Make some love music, you know?
And then your notes will just cum to you.

808
00:58:24,747 --> 00:58:27,819
- Oh, Matt!
- Stop.

809
00:58:28,027 --> 00:58:29,460
Matt. Matt.

810
00:58:32,547 --> 00:58:34,902
Go long, you asshole. Go.

811
00:58:35,667 --> 00:58:37,464
Hey, Elyse.

812
00:58:38,667 --> 00:58:40,544
Throw it back. Come on.

813
00:58:41,307 --> 00:58:42,706
What you got?

814
00:58:50,067 --> 00:58:51,386
Missed. Sorry.

815
00:58:52,947 --> 00:58:54,585
Hey, if I have to ring the triangle...

816
00:58:54,667 --> 00:58:56,498
- you have to throw the football, all right?
- Okay.

817
00:58:56,587 --> 00:58:58,384
Draw your arm back. There you go.

818
00:58:58,467 --> 00:59:02,062
Shoulder to your target. Right.
Okay, now step forward.

819
00:59:02,147 --> 00:59:04,456
Come on we're not marching. One foot.

820
00:59:04,547 --> 00:59:07,300
- Okay.
- You're fine. Ready? There you go.

821
00:59:07,547 --> 00:59:08,866
Draw the ball over your ear...

822
00:59:08,947 --> 00:59:11,984
and when you throw it, let it roll
right off your fingers, all right?

823
00:59:13,147 --> 00:59:14,216
Okay.

824
00:59:14,547 --> 00:59:15,946
Come on, throw it.

825
00:59:21,627 --> 00:59:23,345
See? I taught you something. What?

826
00:59:23,427 --> 00:59:25,816
So every time I throw it,
you're gonna run and go get it?

827
00:59:25,907 --> 00:59:27,579
That's generally how it works.

828
00:59:27,667 --> 00:59:29,419
Like playing fetch with my dog.

829
00:59:29,507 --> 00:59:33,136
- Yeah, except I don't lick my own balls.
- You would if you could.

830
00:59:33,467 --> 00:59:34,456
Oh, yeah.

831
00:59:36,027 --> 00:59:37,142
Okay, again.

832
00:59:38,067 --> 00:59:39,216
Right here.

833
00:59:40,387 --> 00:59:42,901
Look, that one looks like a bunny.

834
00:59:43,227 --> 00:59:45,058
No, it doesn't.

835
00:59:46,347 --> 00:59:48,338
Maybe a bunny with one nut.

836
00:59:48,547 --> 00:59:51,186
- No, that's its tail.
- Whatever you say.

837
00:59:54,427 --> 00:59:57,385
- You think we'll win this thing?
- Hell, yeah, we will.

838
00:59:57,507 --> 01:00:01,625
- Lf you write in a bagpipe part.
- Oh, God, I'll never make that mistake again.

839
01:00:01,707 --> 01:00:04,619
- What?
- The eighth grade recital.

840
01:00:05,627 --> 01:00:07,982
You made me write in a part for you.

841
01:00:10,187 --> 01:00:12,064
You wore your kilt.

842
01:00:13,387 --> 01:00:15,776
Yeah, Steve showed up with his friends.

843
01:00:16,387 --> 01:00:18,503
They gave me so much shit for that.

844
01:00:18,827 --> 01:00:21,102
I didn't come out of my room for days.

845
01:00:21,387 --> 01:00:24,459
You made it up to him
by stealing all my underwear...

846
01:00:24,547 --> 01:00:26,822
so you could run them up the flagpole.

847
01:00:27,747 --> 01:00:29,499
Including my training bras.

848
01:00:32,467 --> 01:00:34,981
Okay, since we're having
some big fucking Oprah moment here...

849
01:00:35,067 --> 01:00:37,023
I'm sorry about your underwear.

850
01:00:37,147 --> 01:00:38,705
And the diary.

851
01:00:41,347 --> 01:00:43,224
And all that other shit, too.

852
01:01:21,867 --> 01:01:22,936
That's it.

853
01:01:23,467 --> 01:01:26,220
- You started it.
- This is gonna get me that scholarship.

854
01:01:26,307 --> 01:01:27,296
What?

855
01:01:27,387 --> 01:01:29,947
I've got to go write this down
before I forget.

856
01:01:31,747 --> 01:01:33,066
Hey. Hey. Hey.

857
01:01:34,827 --> 01:01:36,783
Could we do this again tomorrow night?

858
01:01:36,867 --> 01:01:39,620
Yeah, sure. I'll see you here at sunset.

859
01:01:40,107 --> 01:01:41,381
Hey.

860
01:01:42,307 --> 01:01:44,662
Should I bring that Picardo thing?

861
01:01:44,747 --> 01:01:46,897
Okay, I'll do a solo for you.

862
01:01:56,667 --> 01:01:58,305
- What's up, Ernie?
- Hey.

863
01:02:16,547 --> 01:02:18,458
It was that fugly nurse again.

864
01:02:32,947 --> 01:02:34,699
Oh, my God.

865
01:02:34,787 --> 01:02:36,061
Matt Stifler?

866
01:02:36,787 --> 01:02:41,258
- Holy shit, look at you.
- Arrianna, what are you doing here?

867
01:02:41,347 --> 01:02:44,544
We practice our routine with the band.
What are you doing here?

868
01:02:44,627 --> 01:02:46,936
I had to come. The school made me.

869
01:02:47,867 --> 01:02:51,143
- Does anybody know about this yet?
- Oh, they do now.

870
01:02:52,147 --> 01:02:55,184
Hey, come on, no pictures.
What're you, the papa-tit-zzy?

871
01:02:55,267 --> 01:02:56,939
- Holy shit, this is so hilarious.
- Smile.

872
01:02:57,027 --> 01:03:00,702
Ladies. No time for fraternizing.

873
01:03:01,667 --> 01:03:05,580
Get the bags.
Guess I'll see you around, bandee.

874
01:03:05,747 --> 01:03:09,820
What a dork.
I'm going to email this to everybody.

875
01:03:31,267 --> 01:03:33,940
Girls, that was great. Percussion, take five.

876
01:03:34,027 --> 01:03:35,699
Horns, we've got to work on intonation.

877
01:03:35,787 --> 01:03:38,301
The final performance is tomorrow,
you guys.

878
01:03:39,107 --> 01:03:40,859
They're so lame.

879
01:03:41,827 --> 01:03:44,102
You play the triangle. How cute.

880
01:03:44,907 --> 01:03:47,944
No, I don't. Look, I told you...

881
01:03:48,587 --> 01:03:49,861
- I had to...
- I gotta go.

882
01:03:49,947 --> 01:03:53,144
- I don't socialize with bandees.
- I'm not a fucking bandee.

883
01:03:53,507 --> 01:03:57,022
I'm not. Look.
I've just been acting like a geek.

884
01:03:57,307 --> 01:04:00,140
I've been playing them
so I could get them on hidden video.

885
01:04:00,227 --> 01:04:03,617
I've been secretly videotaping them
doing all this crazy shit.

886
01:04:04,547 --> 01:04:07,425
- Really?
- Yeah, I could show you.

887
01:04:09,947 --> 01:04:12,177
Okay, come by after dinner.

888
01:04:12,667 --> 01:04:15,181
I'll leave my pompoms
in the window for you.

889
01:04:47,307 --> 01:04:49,901
- You're late.
- Yeah, no shit. Open the window.

890
01:04:53,107 --> 01:04:54,938
Hold on. Be careful with it.

891
01:05:03,667 --> 01:05:06,784
All right, one condition
before I show you the fruits of my labors.

892
01:05:06,867 --> 01:05:08,016
What's that?

893
01:05:08,347 --> 01:05:11,066
I want that picture
on that camera phone erased.

894
01:05:22,227 --> 01:05:25,219
Nobody at school hears
about the triangle or the beanie.

895
01:05:25,307 --> 01:05:27,821
I don't want anybody
to think I'm a dorky-ass bandee.

896
01:05:27,907 --> 01:05:29,659
Fine. Like, now can we get on with it?

897
01:05:29,747 --> 01:05:33,057
As soon as you get rid of that picture
of me on your phone.

898
01:05:46,867 --> 01:05:49,586
Are you going into town?
Not tonight. I'm too tired.

899
01:05:49,667 --> 01:05:52,181
Besides, they're much hotter here.

900
01:05:52,267 --> 01:05:55,065
I know. It's a great crop this year.

901
01:06:09,267 --> 01:06:13,021
- There. Done deal.
- Now can we see the video?

902
01:06:13,867 --> 01:06:15,425
Stiffmeister Productions...

903
01:06:15,507 --> 01:06:18,943
in association with
its talented new director, Matthew Stifler...

904
01:06:19,027 --> 01:06:20,938
is happy to premier the unedited...

905
01:06:21,027 --> 01:06:25,305
unfiltered, and un-fucking-believable
Bandeez Gone Wild.

906
01:06:26,587 --> 01:06:27,702
Oh, yeah.

907
01:06:31,787 --> 01:06:35,462
- Oh, my God.
- That is unbelievable.

908
01:06:57,187 --> 01:06:59,417
- You're kidding me, right?
- That's great.

909
01:07:00,827 --> 01:07:03,864
Danielle likes Jimmy,
but she's like a foot taller than him.

910
01:07:03,947 --> 01:07:05,346
And wait till you hear this.

911
01:07:05,427 --> 01:07:07,895
Sheree slept with that big Oscar guy,
the drummer.

912
01:07:07,987 --> 01:07:09,420
Said he was amazing.

913
01:07:09,987 --> 01:07:13,059
I hooked up with Brandon once.
Some drummer. He has...

914
01:07:13,147 --> 01:07:14,899
no rhythm,
and he can't even bang very long.

915
01:07:15,067 --> 01:07:16,785
Oh, my God. Are you serious?

916
01:07:16,867 --> 01:07:20,860
Yeah, he's a preemie. I'm not talking
about the day he was born, either.

917
01:07:21,867 --> 01:07:24,506
Can you get my back?
I think I got a little bit of sun today?

918
01:07:24,587 --> 01:07:25,576
Sure.

919
01:07:25,787 --> 01:07:28,585
Get this. He has one ball.

920
01:07:29,147 --> 01:07:31,377
No way.
One ball.

921
01:07:32,467 --> 01:07:35,300
Yeah, that why he carries that big stick
around everywhere.

922
01:07:35,387 --> 01:07:37,343
It's got his other ball on top.

923
01:07:40,427 --> 01:07:42,145
Shit, shit, oh, shit.

924
01:07:45,067 --> 01:07:46,500
What is that thing?

925
01:07:59,987 --> 01:08:01,261
Let's kill it.

926
01:08:02,627 --> 01:08:03,776
- Where'd he go?
- There he is.

927
01:08:03,867 --> 01:08:04,936
Look out.

928
01:08:43,227 --> 01:08:45,058
This is going into the lake.

929
01:08:46,067 --> 01:08:48,456
No one's gonna know
about your little video.

930
01:08:48,547 --> 01:08:51,061
'Cause the shit you got us doing on tape...

931
01:08:55,907 --> 01:08:59,422
So we got a contest to win tomorrow.
And I don't want to see you.

932
01:08:59,787 --> 01:09:00,902
Understand?

933
01:09:06,787 --> 01:09:08,140
Did you help him?

934
01:09:32,107 --> 01:09:33,699
With East Great Falls
in the lead...

935
01:09:33,787 --> 01:09:36,426
Beechwood has to win
the Band Camp Playoffs.

936
01:09:36,547 --> 01:09:38,663
Direct yourselves to the marching field
in one hour.

937
01:09:40,067 --> 01:09:43,298
Now, Dr. Choi, Brandon Vandecamp
from Beechwood...

938
01:09:43,387 --> 01:09:45,582
is our best musician by far...

939
01:09:45,667 --> 01:09:50,457
and his father, Landon,
is our best donor, also by far.

940
01:09:51,347 --> 01:09:55,420
Robards needs talented musicians
as much as we need talented donors.

941
01:10:02,587 --> 01:10:03,861
Ipecac.

942
01:10:06,147 --> 01:10:09,219
- So how's it going? Are you having fun?
- It's okay.

943
01:10:14,427 --> 01:10:16,543
How about some Ipecac, Vande-cooch?

944
01:10:19,347 --> 01:10:23,056
This herbal fucking extract will help you
Beechwood fief play in tune, huh?

945
01:10:24,547 --> 01:10:25,536
Shit.

946
01:10:34,627 --> 01:10:36,936
I told you
I don't want to see you anymore, Stifler.

947
01:10:37,027 --> 01:10:39,097
Some day, you'll thank me, asshole.

948
01:10:43,707 --> 01:10:46,301
- Orange?
- Again?

949
01:10:46,827 --> 01:10:48,783
- Damn.
- That orange shit is janky.

950
01:10:48,867 --> 01:10:50,698
I'm feeling grape, dawg.

951
01:10:53,467 --> 01:10:57,255
I don't care how many times they
won. They're not getting the grape today.

952
01:10:57,347 --> 01:10:59,622
That's what I'm talking about.

953
01:11:01,227 --> 01:11:03,980
Your five-time defending
champion...

954
01:11:04,587 --> 01:11:06,339
Beechwood Academy.

955
01:11:37,107 --> 01:11:40,224
- They're tight.
- Yeah, they're better then ever this year.

956
01:11:40,307 --> 01:11:41,706
Okay, everybody.

957
01:11:42,187 --> 01:11:44,303
It's no surprise Beechwood is good.

958
01:11:44,667 --> 01:11:48,057
But this year is different.
This year, we can beat them.

959
01:11:48,947 --> 01:11:52,019
We've worked hard,
and we are good enough...

960
01:11:52,107 --> 01:11:54,575
and this is our time, so lets win the cup.

961
01:11:54,667 --> 01:11:56,578
Yeah!

962
01:12:30,067 --> 01:12:31,705
Beechwood Academy.

963
01:12:31,787 --> 01:12:35,177
Their music today was composed
by senior drum major...

964
01:12:35,267 --> 01:12:37,144
Brandon Vandecamp.

965
01:12:37,307 --> 01:12:38,376
Beat that.

966
01:12:41,227 --> 01:12:44,617
East Great Falls,
you may enter the field for competition.

967
01:13:01,227 --> 01:13:04,264
Band 10 hut. One, two, ready.
Shit.

968
01:13:04,347 --> 01:13:05,860
Leesy, wait, no.

969
01:13:05,947 --> 01:13:07,903
No. Wait.

970
01:13:17,787 --> 01:13:20,017
You know, I'm so sorry.
I don't know what happened.

971
01:13:20,107 --> 01:13:22,177
Not my shoes. Here we go.

972
01:13:26,827 --> 01:13:27,862
Stifler!

973
01:13:44,987 --> 01:13:47,137
You know, you're like
your brother, Steve.

974
01:13:47,227 --> 01:13:50,697
And I don't think those are the shoes
you should be so eager to fill.

975
01:13:50,787 --> 01:13:53,745
You know, the people
Steve thought were his friends...

976
01:13:53,867 --> 01:13:56,381
- really didn't like him very much.
- What?

977
01:13:56,467 --> 01:13:57,866
But I think you're different.

978
01:13:57,947 --> 01:14:02,020
I think people want to like you, Matt.
You just make it really hard.

979
01:14:15,787 --> 01:14:19,496
Parting is such sweet sorrow.
When you're a loser.

980
01:14:25,787 --> 01:14:29,905
Mr. Levenstein reports
that there were a few incidents...

981
01:14:29,987 --> 01:14:31,215
at camp.

982
01:14:31,707 --> 01:14:34,096
But he also says that...

983
01:14:34,227 --> 01:14:37,822
you bonded with the band briefly.

984
01:14:41,707 --> 01:14:45,780
When school starts,
you're going to be on a very short leash.

985
01:14:45,987 --> 01:14:49,582
Remember, the Shermanator sees it all.

986
01:14:50,907 --> 01:14:52,135
Be gone.

987
01:14:56,867 --> 01:14:58,983
Did everybody hate my brother?

988
01:15:09,867 --> 01:15:13,337
Stardate: August 21, 2005.

989
01:15:13,907 --> 01:15:16,182
Some progress made with Stiffy Junior.

990
01:15:16,587 --> 01:15:18,942
Behavior modification evident.

991
01:15:20,347 --> 01:15:22,019
Will continue to monitor.

992
01:15:22,627 --> 01:15:24,777
Shermanator out.

993
01:15:35,467 --> 01:15:37,822
A little "Double-D Sheree" action.

994
01:15:42,227 --> 01:15:44,024
Little bit of Dr. Robot.

995
01:15:45,787 --> 01:15:47,220
Crazy fucker.

996
01:16:52,627 --> 01:16:53,901
Hey, Stifler, where's your instrument?

997
01:16:53,987 --> 01:16:55,136
Dude, you're in the wrong uniform.

998
01:16:55,227 --> 01:16:57,900
Screw them, dude. They're gonna freak out
when they see the video.

999
01:16:57,987 --> 01:17:00,103
Look, we thought that if we had
an advance screening...

1000
01:17:00,187 --> 01:17:02,178
then everyone would see
that you're not really a dork.

1001
01:17:02,267 --> 01:17:04,542
I can't. It's gone.

1002
01:17:05,547 --> 01:17:08,584
- What?
- The video, man, I deleted it.

1003
01:17:09,547 --> 01:17:10,536
Why?

1004
01:17:11,427 --> 01:17:13,987
Guess little bro's quitting
the family business.

1005
01:17:14,067 --> 01:17:15,500
Are you kidding me?

1006
01:17:18,907 --> 01:17:20,738
He went fucking bandee on us.

1007
01:17:36,467 --> 01:17:37,946
Hey, what's up, guys?

1008
01:17:38,707 --> 01:17:40,584
You a dead man, motherfucker.

1009
01:17:41,347 --> 01:17:43,258
- You, too, little man.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1010
01:17:43,587 --> 01:17:47,296
Dude, the purple puke was an accident.
Somebody switched the coolers.

1011
01:17:51,827 --> 01:17:53,943
Hey, that orange shit is janky, yo.

1012
01:17:54,627 --> 01:17:59,257
Chloe, we never saw Elyse,
you know, naked.

1013
01:17:59,987 --> 01:18:01,864
Matt turned off the computer.

1014
01:18:02,707 --> 01:18:05,175
So we're just supposed to forgive him now?

1015
01:18:06,227 --> 01:18:08,821
- He's still an asshole.
- You're right.

1016
01:18:09,787 --> 01:18:11,061
I am an asshole.

1017
01:18:11,467 --> 01:18:13,617
I can't take back spying on you...

1018
01:18:13,707 --> 01:18:15,982
and I can't win that Bandee Cup thing.

1019
01:18:16,107 --> 01:18:18,860
But I can help someone
get what she deserves.

1020
01:18:19,667 --> 01:18:21,737
I'm not asking you to forgive me.

1021
01:18:21,947 --> 01:18:24,415
Just help me help Elyse.

1022
01:18:34,907 --> 01:18:37,262
- I got the number.
- Go ahead.

1023
01:18:37,347 --> 01:18:40,737
555-0171.

1024
01:18:42,667 --> 01:18:45,306
He shouldn't have been dumping Ipecac
in anyone's cooler.

1025
01:18:45,387 --> 01:18:47,139
We could've won on our own.

1026
01:18:49,347 --> 01:18:53,465
I don't even care that he saw me on camera.
Well, I mean I do, but...

1027
01:18:54,507 --> 01:18:56,657
Honey, this just came for you.

1028
01:19:00,267 --> 01:19:01,666
It's from Robards.

1029
01:19:03,067 --> 01:19:04,295
What's it say?

1030
01:19:05,987 --> 01:19:08,455
Dr. Choi wants to meet with me?

1031
01:19:25,587 --> 01:19:27,498
- Okay.
- Okay.

1032
01:19:27,707 --> 01:19:29,538
- Okay.
- Okay.

1033
01:19:31,147 --> 01:19:32,182
Bye.

1034
01:19:47,747 --> 01:19:50,056
Hi. Elyse Houston.

1035
01:19:51,227 --> 01:19:53,866
I have an appointment with Dr. Choi.

1036
01:19:54,907 --> 01:19:58,343
- You're not in the book.
- No, there must be some mistake. See...

1037
01:20:00,227 --> 01:20:01,546
I have a letter.

1038
01:20:06,827 --> 01:20:08,624
This letter is, well...

1039
01:20:09,387 --> 01:20:10,536
It's a fake.

1040
01:20:11,027 --> 01:20:13,825
- This is not Dr. Choi's signature.
- What?

1041
01:20:26,507 --> 01:20:27,576
Stifler.

1042
01:20:31,227 --> 01:20:33,377
You son of a bitch.

1043
01:20:34,987 --> 01:20:39,185
What? It wasn't enough
for you to humiliate me at Band Camp?

1044
01:20:39,267 --> 01:20:41,827
Now you have to set me up here?

1045
01:21:01,427 --> 01:21:03,065
What's going on here?

1046
01:21:04,467 --> 01:21:05,866
This is my band.

1047
01:21:06,307 --> 01:21:08,104
And that's her music.

1048
01:22:04,027 --> 01:22:05,016
Well...

1049
01:22:05,587 --> 01:22:09,136
I've certainly seen some interesting attempts
to gain admission...

1050
01:22:09,787 --> 01:22:11,345
but this is a first.

1051
01:22:12,827 --> 01:22:16,866
Excellent audition, Miss. Houston.
Let's go discuss that scholarship.

1052
01:22:18,267 --> 01:22:19,700
I thought Brandon won.

1053
01:22:19,787 --> 01:22:22,984
No, Mr. Vandecamp
was disqualified for plagiarism.

1054
01:22:23,067 --> 01:22:24,136
All right.

1055
01:22:26,267 --> 01:22:28,223
That's what I'm talking about, yo.

1056
01:22:32,227 --> 01:22:34,502
Oh, my God, you guys, that was amazing.

1057
01:22:35,067 --> 01:22:38,946
- Thank you so much.
- Thank him. It was his idea.

1058
01:22:39,027 --> 01:22:40,016
Word.

1059
01:22:42,707 --> 01:22:46,177
- You planned all this?
- With some friends.

1060
01:22:48,987 --> 01:22:50,215
Come here.

1061
01:22:54,667 --> 01:22:56,942
Oh, I believe this is yours.

1062
01:22:58,307 --> 01:22:59,422
You know...

1063
01:23:00,107 --> 01:23:03,986
Picardo is a brand of piccolo.

1064
01:23:04,907 --> 01:23:07,137
You really are an asshole sometimes...

1065
01:23:07,547 --> 01:23:08,536
Stiffy.

1066
01:26:21,627 --> 01:26:23,345
Man, change the channel, yo.

1067
01:26:23,547 --> 01:26:26,459
Hook a brother up with some mad beats.

1068
01:26:26,707 --> 01:26:28,299
Will you cut that out?

1069
01:26:28,787 --> 01:26:30,823
Your name is James Hi Ping Chong.

1070
01:26:30,947 --> 01:26:32,539
Your dad owns a Chinese restaurant.

1071
01:26:32,627 --> 01:26:35,141
You live in the suburbs. 
You ain't never gonna be a gangsta.

1072
01:26:35,747 --> 01:26:36,736
Damn!

1073
01:26:39,307 --> 01:26:40,376
That's cold, dawg.
