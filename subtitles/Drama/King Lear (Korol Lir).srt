Oswald - A. PETRENKO

00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:39,926
King of France - I. BUDRAITIS

21
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,128
I thought the king had more affected

22
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:06,572
the Duke of Albany
than Cornwall.

23
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:09,075
It did always seem so to us.

24
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:12,336
But now,
in the division of the kingdom,

25
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,905
it appears not which of the dukes
he values most.

26
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:18,985
For equalities are so weighed,

27
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:22,344
that curiosity in neither
can make choice

28
00:05:22,956 --> 00:05:25,584
of either's moiety.

29
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:28,160
Is not this your son, my lord?

30
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:32,231
I have so often blushed
to acknowledge him,

31
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:35,362
that now I am brazed to it.

32
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:37,536
I cannot conceive you.

33
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:41,639
This young fellow's mother could:

34
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:45,504
She had a son for her cradle before
she had a husband for her bed.

35
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,147
Do you smell a fault?

36
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:49,905
I cannot wish the fault undone,

37
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:53,346
the issue of it
being so proper.

38
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,438
But I have a son, sir,
by order of law,

39
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:18,941
some year elder than this.

40
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:18,759
Attend the Lords of France

41
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:21,363
and Burgundy, Gloster.

42
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:23,331
I shall, my liege.

43
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:29,731
Meantime we shall express

44
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:33,145
our darker purpose.

45
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,098
Know all.

46
00:08:57,404 --> 00:08:59,235
Know all:

47
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:03,500
We have divided
in three our kingdom.

48
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:07,911
Tis our intent to shake all cares
from our age,

49
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:10,580
conferring them on younger strengths,

50
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:13,645
while we unburdened crawl
toward death.

51
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:17,350
Our son of Cornwall,

52
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:21,156
and you, our son of Albany, we have
this hour a constant will to publish

53
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:24,528
our daughters' several dowers,

54
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:27,926
that future strife
may be prevented now.

55
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,003
The princes,
France and Burgundy,

56
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:35,538
great rivals in our youngest
daughter's love,

57
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:37,838
long here are to be answered.

58
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:51,213
Tell me, my daughters...

59
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:01,830
which of you
doth love us most?

60
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:05,160
That we our largest bounty may extend

61
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:07,833
where nature doth with merit
challenge.

62
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:10,903
Goneril, our eldest born,
speak first.

63
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:21,016
I love you more than
words can wield the matter.

64
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:26,114
Dearer than eyesight,
space and liberty,

65
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,425
beyond what can be valued,
rich or rare.

66
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,828
No less than life, with grace,
health, beauty, honour.

67
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:36,595
As much as child e'er loved,

68
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,338
or father found.

69
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:45,006
A love that makes my speech unable,
beyond all manner so much I love you.

70
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:51,250
What shall Cordelia do?

71
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:56,149
Of all these bounds, even from this
line to this,

72
00:10:57,123 --> 00:11:01,753
we make thee lady: To thine and
Albany's issue be this perpetual.

73
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,976
What says our second daughter,
our dearest Regan,

74
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:19,677
wife to Cornwall? Speak.

75
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:25,448
I am made of that self metal
as my sister,

76
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,453
and prize me at her worth.

77
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:31,350
In my true heart

78
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:33,583
I find she names my very deed
of love,

79
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,458
only she comes too short.

80
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:42,499
And find am alone felicitate
in your dear highness' love.

81
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:46,405
In your dear highness' love.

82
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:56,313
To thee and thine hereditary ever

83
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,207
remain this ample third of our fair
kingdom.

84
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,516
Then poor Cordelia!

85
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:10,353
And yet not so,

86
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:13,830
since my love's more richer
than my tongue.

87
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:18,237
Now, ourjoy,

88
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:22,638
what can you say to draw a third
more opulent than your sisters'?

89
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:26,405
Nothing, my lord.

90
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,506
Nothing?

91
00:12:29,382 --> 00:12:30,644
Nothing.

92
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,154
Nothing will come of nothing.

93
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,162
Speak again.

94
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:54,765
Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave
my heart into my mouth.

95
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:57,668
I love your majesty
according to my bond,

96
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:04,144
nor more nor less.

97
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:23,235
Cordelia, mend your speech a little,

98
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,838
lest it may mar your fortunes.

99
00:13:33,113 --> 00:13:35,673
Good my lord,
you have begot me,

100
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:38,182
bred me, loved me.

101
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:42,013
I return those duties back
as are right fit:

102
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:45,580
Obey you, love you,
and most honour you.

103
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:51,828
Why have my sisters husbands,
if they say they love you all?

104
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:55,666
Haply, when I shall wed,

105
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:59,493
that lord shall carry half my love
with him, half my care and duty.

106
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:03,337
Sure, I shall never marry
like my sisters,

107
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:06,241
to love my father all.

108
00:14:10,884 --> 00:14:12,442
But goes thy heart with this?

109
00:14:13,787 --> 00:14:15,345
Ay, good my lord.

110
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:20,851
So young, and so untender?

111
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:24,657
So young, my lord, and true.

112
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:28,834
Let it be so, -
thy truth, then, be your dower!

113
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:31,436
For, by the sacred
radiance of the sun,

114
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:34,437
here I disclaim all my paternal care,

115
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:38,065
propinquity and property of blood,
and as a stranger to my heart and me

116
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:40,075
hold thee, from this, for ever!

117
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:42,071
Peace, Kent!

118
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:44,507
I loved her most,

119
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:47,243
and thought to set my rest
on her kind nursery.

120
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:50,355
Hence, and avoid my sight!

121
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:54,916
Call France!
Call Burgundy!

122
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:59,157
Cornwall and Albany, with my two
daughters' dowers digest this third.

123
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:02,763
Let pride, which she calls plainness,
marry her.

124
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:07,139
Ourself, by monthly course, with
reservation of an hundred knights,

125
00:15:07,374 --> 00:15:09,569
shall our abode make with you
by due turns.

126
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:12,802
We still retain the name, and all
the additions to a king,

127
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:15,345
the sway, revenue, execution
of the rest be yours.

128
00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:19,075
Royal Lear, whom I have ever honoured
as my king,

129
00:15:19,853 --> 00:15:21,184
as my great patron thought on
in my prayers...

130
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:22,512
The bow is bent and drawn!

131
00:15:22,722 --> 00:15:24,747
Make from the shaft!

132
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:27,927
Let it fall rather, though the fork
invade the region of my heart.

133
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:33,929
Be Kent unmannerly,
when Lear is mad.

134
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:36,994
What wouldst thou want?

135
00:15:37,404 --> 00:15:40,237
That duty shall have dread to speak,
when power to flattery bows?

136
00:15:40,974 --> 00:15:42,373
Answer my life my judgement,

137
00:15:42,876 --> 00:15:45,640
thy youngest daughter
does not love thee least.

138
00:15:45,845 --> 00:15:47,574
Nor are those empty-hearted

139
00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:50,808
whose low sound
reverbs no hollowness.

140
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:52,814
Kent, on thy life, no more.

141
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:56,188
My life I never held but as a pawn
to wage against thy enemies.

142
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:58,354
No fear to lose it,
thy safety being the motive.

143
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:00,822
- Out of my sight!
- See better, Lear.

144
00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:03,154
Now, by Apollo!

145
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:07,666
Now, by Apollo, king,
thou swear'st thy gods in vain.

146
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,595
O, vassal! Miscreant!

147
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:13,670
Dear sir, forbear.

148
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:18,943
Hear me, recreant!
On thine allegiance, hear me!

149
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:25,140
If tomorrow thy banished trunk
be found in our dominions,

150
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:27,418
the moment is thy death!

151
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:30,216
Fare thee well, king!

152
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:32,988
Sith thus thou wilt appear,

153
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,590
freedom leaves hence,
and banishment is here.

154
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:52,836
Here's France and Burgundy,
my noble lord.

155
00:16:57,951 --> 00:17:01,250
My Lord of Burgundy,
we first address towards you,

156
00:17:01,721 --> 00:17:03,484
who with this king
have rivalled for our daughter.

157
00:17:04,157 --> 00:17:06,318
When she was dear to us,
we did hold her so,

158
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:08,820
but now her price is fallen.

159
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:14,896
Will you, with those infirmities she
owes, dowered with our curse,

160
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:17,069
and stranger'd with our oath,
take her or leave her?

161
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,668
I tell you all her wealth.

162
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:24,508
Pardon me, royal sir.

163
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:32,150
For you, great king,
I would not from your love

164
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:36,155
make such a stray,
to match you where I hate.

165
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:55,297
Must be a faith that reason without
miracle should never plant in me.

166
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:58,134
I yet beseech your majesty,

167
00:18:00,013 --> 00:18:04,677
if for I want that glib and oily art,
to speak and purpose not,

168
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:15,086
that you make known

169
00:18:15,729 --> 00:18:17,356
it is no vicious blot, murder,

170
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:20,766
or foulness that hath deprived me
of your grace and favour,

171
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,571
but even for want of that
for which I an richer, -

172
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:30,802
a still-soliciting eye, and such
a tongue as I am glad I have not.

173
00:18:42,022 --> 00:18:45,150
Thou hast her, France:
Let her be thine!

174
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:47,355
For we have no such daughter!

175
00:18:56,202 --> 00:19:01,435
Time shall unfold what pleated
cunning hides:

176
00:19:03,777 --> 00:19:06,337
Who covers faults, at last
shame them derides.

177
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:11,744
An hundred knights to add to retinue!

178
00:19:12,686 --> 00:19:15,211
A hundred knights to add to retinue!

179
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:18,583
Saddle the horses!
Call the train together!

180
00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:22,521
Saddle the horses!
Call the train together!

181
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:43,009
The barbarian that makes his genera-
tion messes to gorge his appetite,

182
00:20:43,376 --> 00:20:46,345
shall to my bosom be as well relieved,
as thou my sometime daughter.

183
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:21,760
Thou, nature, art my goddess!

184
00:24:22,896 --> 00:24:24,955
To thy law my services are bound.

185
00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:30,125
Wherefore should I permit deprive me,
if I'm 12 moonshines lag of a brother?

186
00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:33,972
Why bastard?

187
00:24:35,175 --> 00:24:37,143
Wherefore base?

188
00:24:38,278 --> 00:24:39,836
Why brand they us with base?

189
00:24:41,381 --> 00:24:45,340
Who, in the lusty stealth of nature,
take more composition and quality

190
00:24:45,719 --> 00:24:48,347
than doth, within a dull, stale,
tired bed,

191
00:24:48,955 --> 00:24:51,446
go to th'creating a whole tribe
of fobs?

192
00:24:55,395 --> 00:24:58,364
Well, my legitimate!

193
00:25:01,301 --> 00:25:04,099
Kent banished thus!

194
00:25:05,371 --> 00:25:07,066
And the king gone tonight!

195
00:25:08,775 --> 00:25:12,142
Subscribed his power!

196
00:25:12,379 --> 00:25:14,347
All this done upon the gad!

197
00:25:34,467 --> 00:25:36,992
Edmund, how now!
What news?

198
00:25:37,203 --> 00:25:38,830
So please your lordship, none.

199
00:25:40,407 --> 00:25:43,342
Why so earnestly seek you
to put up that letter?

200
00:25:43,877 --> 00:25:46,573
I know no news,
my lord.

201
00:25:47,847 --> 00:25:50,145
What paper were you reading?

202
00:25:50,383 --> 00:25:52,351
Nothing, my lord.

203
00:25:53,453 --> 00:25:58,049
Why, then, that terrible dispatch of
it into your pocket? Let's see.

204
00:25:58,258 --> 00:26:01,750
Sir, pardon me.
It is a letter from my brother.

205
00:26:02,095 --> 00:26:03,824
I find it not fit for your
o'er-Iooking.

206
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,429
Give me the letter.

207
00:26:05,699 --> 00:26:08,930
I shall offend,
either to detain or give it.

208
00:26:09,102 --> 00:26:11,002
I hope, for my brother's
justification, he wrote this

209
00:26:11,204 --> 00:26:12,762
but as a taste of my virtue.

210
00:26:13,106 --> 00:26:17,167
<<The reverence of age makes the world
bitter to the best of our times,

211
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:21,176
keeps our fortunes from us till our
oldness cannot relish them.

212
00:26:22,649 --> 00:26:25,049
I find an idle bondage in
the oppression of aged tyranny,

213
00:26:25,252 --> 00:26:28,221
who sways,
not as it hath power,

214
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:30,286
but as it is suffered.

215
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:34,055
Come to me, that of this
I may speak more.

216
00:26:34,928 --> 00:26:38,159
If our father would sleep

217
00:26:38,698 --> 00:26:40,666
till I waked him,

218
00:26:44,271 --> 00:26:48,230
you should enjoy half his
revenue for ever,

219
00:26:48,808 --> 00:26:52,175
and live the beloved
of your brother, Edgar>>.

220
00:26:52,946 --> 00:26:56,245
Hum... Conspiracy!

221
00:26:58,551 --> 00:27:03,921
O villain!
Abhorred villain!

222
00:27:05,091 --> 00:27:08,322
Unnatural, detested,
brutish villain!

223
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:10,326
Where is he?

224
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:12,897
Suspend your indignation

225
00:27:13,099 --> 00:27:15,727
till you can derive from him
better testimony of his intent.

226
00:27:17,937 --> 00:27:22,135
Edmund, seek him out,

227
00:27:23,943 --> 00:27:27,674
wind me into him.

228
00:27:28,782 --> 00:27:33,845
These late eclipses
in the sun and moon

229
00:27:34,721 --> 00:27:37,690
portend no good to us:

230
00:27:38,959 --> 00:27:41,621
Brothers divide,

231
00:27:42,195 --> 00:27:45,824
in cities, mutinies,
in countries, discord,

232
00:27:46,866 --> 00:27:48,891
in palaces, treason.

233
00:27:49,869 --> 00:27:53,236
And the bond cracked
twixt son and father.

234
00:27:54,174 --> 00:27:56,438
We have seen the best of our time.

235
00:27:59,479 --> 00:28:01,913
- When saw you my father last?
- The night gone by.

236
00:28:02,115 --> 00:28:04,345
- Spake you with him?
- Ay, two hours together.

237
00:28:04,551 --> 00:28:08,578
Parted you in good terms?
Found you no displeasure in him?

238
00:28:08,788 --> 00:28:10,085
None at all.

239
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:13,152
Bethink yourself wherein you may
have offended him.

240
00:28:14,294 --> 00:28:16,990
And at my entreaty
forbear his presence

241
00:28:17,197 --> 00:28:19,597
till some little time hath qualified
the heat of his displeasure.

242
00:28:20,901 --> 00:28:22,869
Some villain
hath done me wrong.

243
00:28:23,803 --> 00:28:26,567
Have a continent forbearance till
the speed of his rage goes slower.

244
00:28:27,774 --> 00:28:31,073
Retire with me to my lodging.
There's my key.

245
00:28:31,244 --> 00:28:33,576
If you do stir abroad, go armed.

246
00:28:33,947 --> 00:28:35,312
Armed, brother!

247
00:28:36,783 --> 00:28:39,308
He hath no good meaning toward you.

248
00:28:41,187 --> 00:28:44,588
What I have told you is nothing
like the image and horror of it.

249
00:28:58,271 --> 00:29:00,364
By the surfeit of our own
behaviour,

250
00:29:01,041 --> 00:29:05,740
we make guilty of our disasters
the sun, the moon, and the stars.

251
00:29:06,379 --> 00:29:09,348
As if we were fools
by heavenly compulsion,

252
00:29:09,783 --> 00:29:14,584
by an enforced obedience
of planetary influence.

253
00:29:14,854 --> 00:29:18,585
And admirable evasion
of whore-master man,

254
00:29:19,025 --> 00:29:22,051
to lay his goatish disposition
to the charge of a star!

255
00:29:23,096 --> 00:29:25,223
Fut, I should have been
what I am,

256
00:29:26,466 --> 00:29:30,664
had the maidenliest star
in the firmament

257
00:29:30,871 --> 00:29:32,600
twinkled on my bastardizing.

258
00:30:35,535 --> 00:30:38,834
Let me not stay a jot for dinner!
Go get it ready!

259
00:31:20,714 --> 00:31:24,741
Dinner, ho, dinner!

260
00:31:37,297 --> 00:31:39,925
Where's my fool?
Go you, and call my fool hither.

261
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,360
You, you sirrah, where's my daughter?

262
00:31:44,571 --> 00:31:46,061
So please you...

263
00:31:46,706 --> 00:31:50,335
What says the fellow there?
Call the clotpoll back!

264
00:31:52,112 --> 00:31:55,343
Where's my fool?
I think the world's asleep.

265
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:58,347
Where's that mongrel?

266
00:31:59,186 --> 00:32:01,518
He says,
your daughter is not well.

267
00:32:01,721 --> 00:32:03,586
Why came not the slave back to me?

268
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:05,917
He answered me,
he would not.

269
00:32:06,126 --> 00:32:07,218
He would not!

270
00:32:07,627 --> 00:32:10,596
My lord, to my judgement,
your highness is not entertained

271
00:32:10,797 --> 00:32:13,766
with that ceremonious affection
as you were wont.

272
00:32:14,401 --> 00:32:16,301
But where's my fool?

273
00:32:17,037 --> 00:32:18,766
I have not seen him this two days.

274
00:32:18,972 --> 00:32:22,772
Since my young lady's going into
France, the fool hath much pined away.

275
00:32:22,976 --> 00:32:24,534
No more of that. Go you,

276
00:32:24,744 --> 00:32:27,144
and tell my daughter
I would speak with her.

277
00:32:27,614 --> 00:32:29,514
Go you, call hither my fool!

278
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:34,511
O, you sir,
you, come you hither, sir.

279
00:32:35,255 --> 00:32:36,916
Who am I, sir?

280
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:39,149
My lady's father.

281
00:32:39,392 --> 00:32:41,417
<<My lady's father>>?
My lord's knave!

282
00:32:41,628 --> 00:32:45,155
- I'll not be struck, my lord!
- Nor tript neither, football player.

283
00:32:46,866 --> 00:32:49,164
I thank thee, fellow. What art thou?

284
00:32:50,203 --> 00:32:52,933
A man, sir. A very honest-
hearted fellow,

285
00:32:53,573 --> 00:32:55,234
and as poor as the king.

286
00:32:56,109 --> 00:32:59,078
If thou be as poor for a subject
as he is for a king,

287
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:01,076
thou art poor enough.

288
00:33:01,481 --> 00:33:02,846
What wouldst thou?

289
00:33:05,485 --> 00:33:06,975
To serve you.

290
00:33:07,253 --> 00:33:11,155
If I like thee no worse after dinner,
I will not part from thee yet.

291
00:33:11,858 --> 00:33:13,485
There's earnest of thy service.

292
00:33:14,628 --> 00:33:16,118
Let me hire him too.

293
00:33:16,396 --> 00:33:20,162
How now, my pretty knave!
How dost thou?

294
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,834
- You were best take my coxcomb.
- Why, fool?

295
00:33:23,036 --> 00:33:27,063
For taking one's part
that's out of favour.

296
00:33:28,641 --> 00:33:32,372
This fellow hath banisht
two one's daughters,

297
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,008
and did the third a blessing
against his will.

298
00:33:37,217 --> 00:33:38,844
If thou follow him, thou must
needs wear my coxcomb.

299
00:33:39,052 --> 00:33:40,781
Take heed, sirrah,
the whip.

300
00:33:42,489 --> 00:33:45,458
Truth's a dog must to kennel,
he must be whipped out,

301
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:48,884
when Lady the brach

302
00:33:49,863 --> 00:33:52,889
may stand by the fire and stink.

303
00:33:54,935 --> 00:33:56,903
A bitter fool!

304
00:33:57,103 --> 00:34:00,664
Dost thou know the difference between
a bitter fool and a sweet fool?

305
00:34:01,107 --> 00:34:03,667
No, lad. Teach me.

306
00:34:05,378 --> 00:34:08,905
That lord that counselled thee
To give away thy land,

307
00:34:09,716 --> 00:34:13,243
Come place him here by me,
Do thou for him stand.

308
00:34:14,387 --> 00:34:17,618
The sweet and bitter fool

309
00:34:18,892 --> 00:34:20,917
Will presently appear,

310
00:34:22,295 --> 00:34:24,627
The one in motley here,

311
00:34:25,131 --> 00:34:27,497
The other found out there.

312
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,497
Dost thou call me fool?

313
00:34:29,702 --> 00:34:33,729
All thy other titles thou hast given
away, that thou wast born with.

314
00:34:34,541 --> 00:34:36,566
This is not altogether fool.

315
00:34:36,776 --> 00:34:39,074
Fools had never less grace in a year,

316
00:34:39,479 --> 00:34:41,504
For wise men are grown foppish,

317
00:34:41,715 --> 00:34:44,684
And know not how their wits to wear,
Their manners are so apish.

318
00:34:44,951 --> 00:34:46,748
When were you wont to be so full
of songs?

319
00:34:46,953 --> 00:34:49,183
Ever since thou madest
thy daughters thy mothers:

320
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:52,085
For when thou gavest them the rod,
and putt'st down thine own breeches.

321
00:34:52,292 --> 00:34:57,355
Then they for sudden joy did weep,
And I for sorrow sung,

322
00:34:58,898 --> 00:35:01,765
That such a king should play bo-peep,

323
00:35:02,802 --> 00:35:04,531
And go the fools among.

324
00:35:06,606 --> 00:35:08,733
Prithee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster

325
00:35:09,442 --> 00:35:12,969
that can teach thy fool to lie.

326
00:35:13,379 --> 00:35:15,404
An you lie, we'll have you whipped.

327
00:35:16,382 --> 00:35:19,977
Thy daughters will have me whipped
for speaking true,

328
00:35:20,186 --> 00:35:22,916
thou'It for lying, and sometimes I'm
whipped for holding my peace.

329
00:35:23,123 --> 00:35:26,092
I had rather be any kind o'thing
than a fool.

330
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,751
And yet I would not
be thee, nuncle.

331
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:35,434
Thou hast pared thy wit o'both sides,
and left nothing in the middle.

332
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:41,206
Here comes one of the parings.

333
00:35:48,781 --> 00:35:51,909
How now, daughter!
What makes that frontlet on?

334
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:57,922
Methinks you are too much
of late in the frown.

335
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,826
Thou wast a pretty fellow

336
00:36:03,029 --> 00:36:05,998
when thou hadst no need
to care for her frowning.

337
00:36:06,866 --> 00:36:08,834
Yes, forsooth, I will hold my tongue.

338
00:36:09,636 --> 00:36:13,003
So your face bids me...

339
00:36:13,573 --> 00:36:15,063
though you say nothing.

340
00:36:23,716 --> 00:36:25,843
Not only, sir, this your
all-licensed fool,

341
00:36:27,854 --> 00:36:30,982
but other of your insolent retinue

342
00:36:32,025 --> 00:36:34,050
do hourly carp and quarrel.

343
00:36:35,261 --> 00:36:37,229
I had thought, by making this
well known unto you,

344
00:36:37,797 --> 00:36:39,355
to have found a safe redress,

345
00:36:39,933 --> 00:36:43,369
but now grow fearful
that you protect this course.

346
00:36:45,705 --> 00:36:47,764
Which if you should,

347
00:36:48,274 --> 00:36:51,505
the fault would not scape censure,
which might in their working

348
00:36:52,112 --> 00:36:54,512
do you that offence,
which else were shame,

349
00:36:54,714 --> 00:36:57,842
that then necessity
will call discreet proceeding.

350
00:36:58,551 --> 00:37:00,678
For, you trow, nuncle.

351
00:37:02,822 --> 00:37:07,122
The hedge-sparrow fed

352
00:37:08,528 --> 00:37:11,895
The cuckoo so long,

353
00:37:13,366 --> 00:37:18,133
That it had its head

354
00:37:19,372 --> 00:37:21,670
Bit off by its young!

355
00:37:23,776 --> 00:37:28,076
So, out went the candle,
and we were left darkling.

356
00:37:29,182 --> 00:37:30,672
Are you our daughter?

357
00:37:30,883 --> 00:37:33,750
I would you would make use
of that good wisdom,

358
00:37:33,953 --> 00:37:37,855
and put away these dispositions,
that transform you from what you are.

359
00:37:39,125 --> 00:37:40,922
Doth any here know me?

360
00:37:41,961 --> 00:37:43,690
Why, this is not Lear!

361
00:37:44,798 --> 00:37:47,733
Doth Lear walk thus?
Speak thus?

362
00:37:48,868 --> 00:37:51,132
Where are his eyes?

363
00:37:52,472 --> 00:37:56,499
Either his notion weakens,
or his discernings are lethargied?

364
00:37:58,178 --> 00:38:02,581
Ha! Waking? 'Tis not so...

365
00:38:04,951 --> 00:38:07,920
Who is it that can tell me
who I am?

366
00:38:08,555 --> 00:38:10,352
Lear's shadow.

367
00:38:11,491 --> 00:38:14,585
I would learn that.

368
00:38:15,795 --> 00:38:18,031
[Skipped item nr. 368]

369
00:38:18,031 --> 00:38:20,090
Knowledge, and reason,

370
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,768
I should be false-persuaded

371
00:38:23,202 --> 00:38:25,170
I had daughters.

372
00:38:26,506 --> 00:38:28,667
Your name, fair gentlewoman?

373
00:38:29,175 --> 00:38:31,666
This admiration, sir,

374
00:38:31,945 --> 00:38:34,140
is much of the savour
of other your new pranks.

375
00:38:35,114 --> 00:38:37,344
I do beseech you to understand
my purposes aright.

376
00:38:38,952 --> 00:38:41,819
Here do you keep a hundred
knights and squires,

377
00:38:42,388 --> 00:38:44,151
men so disordered, so debosht,
and bold,

378
00:38:44,724 --> 00:38:46,988
that this our court

379
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:50,222
shows like a riotous inn.

380
00:38:51,631 --> 00:38:54,099
The shame itself doth speak
for instant remedy:

381
00:38:54,267 --> 00:38:55,529
Be, then, desired by her,

382
00:38:55,735 --> 00:38:58,704
that else will take
the thing she begs.

383
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:02,608
A little to disquantity
your train,

384
00:39:03,209 --> 00:39:05,177
And the remainder,
that shall still depend,

385
00:39:05,812 --> 00:39:09,578
to be such men
which know themselves and you.

386
00:39:10,083 --> 00:39:15,350
Darkness and devils!
Saddle my horses!

387
00:39:15,555 --> 00:39:16,647
Saddle my horses!

388
00:39:16,856 --> 00:39:18,585
Call my train together!

389
00:39:20,693 --> 00:39:22,524
Degenerate bastard!

390
00:39:22,862 --> 00:39:25,831
I'll not trouble thee.

391
00:39:26,032 --> 00:39:28,159
Yet have I left a daughter.

392
00:39:29,469 --> 00:39:32,438
Woe, that too late repents.

393
00:39:34,807 --> 00:39:37,776
Saddle my horses!

394
00:39:45,418 --> 00:39:48,478
Is it your will? Speak, sir.
Prepare my horses.

395
00:39:48,688 --> 00:39:50,178
Pray, sir, be patient.

396
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:53,359
Detested kite! Thou liest!

397
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,989
Beat at this gate, that let thy folly
in, and thy dearjudgement out!

398
00:39:56,796 --> 00:39:58,354
Go, go, my people!

399
00:39:58,631 --> 00:40:01,156
I am guiltless, as I am ignorant
of what hath moved you.

400
00:40:01,401 --> 00:40:02,663
It may be so, my lord.

401
00:40:10,043 --> 00:40:13,774
Hear, nature, hear,
dear goddess, hear!

402
00:40:14,881 --> 00:40:16,781
Into her womb convey sterility!

403
00:40:17,417 --> 00:40:20,614
If she must teem,

404
00:40:21,487 --> 00:40:25,253
create her child that be a thwart
disnatured torment to her!

405
00:40:27,026 --> 00:40:29,187
That she may feel
how sharper

406
00:40:29,362 --> 00:40:31,887
than a serpent's tooth it is
to have a thankless child.

407
00:40:32,098 --> 00:40:34,589
Away, away!

408
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:58,915
But let his disposition have that
scope that dotage gives it.

409
00:40:59,192 --> 00:41:01,023
What, Oswald, ho!

410
00:41:03,129 --> 00:41:07,065
This man hath had good counsel:
A hundred knights!

411
00:41:07,467 --> 00:41:10,163
On every fancy, he may enguard
his dotage with their powers,

412
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:12,338
and hold our lives in mercy.

413
00:41:14,774 --> 00:41:16,173
Oswald, I say!

414
00:41:16,376 --> 00:41:18,674
Well, you may fear too far.

415
00:41:19,279 --> 00:41:22,578
Safer than trust too far.

416
00:41:24,884 --> 00:41:26,852
What he hath uttered
I have writ my sister.

417
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:31,351
If she sustain him and his hundred
knights, when I've showed th'unfitness.

418
00:41:32,792 --> 00:41:34,760
Take you some company,
and away to horse.

419
00:41:35,562 --> 00:41:38,531
Inform her full of my
particular fear.

420
00:41:43,303 --> 00:41:45,533
This milky gentleness and course
of yours,

421
00:41:46,139 --> 00:41:48,130
though I condemn not,
yet, under pardon,

422
00:41:48,374 --> 00:41:50,899
you are much more attaskt
for want of wisdom

423
00:41:51,244 --> 00:41:53,337
than praised for harmful mildness.

424
00:42:07,127 --> 00:42:11,154
A fox, when one has caught her,
And such a daughter,

425
00:42:11,798 --> 00:42:16,701
Should sure to the slaughter,

426
00:42:16,869 --> 00:42:19,838
If my cap would buy a halter,

427
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:24,767
So the fool follows after.

428
00:42:26,579 --> 00:42:30,743
Old fond eyes,
beweep this cause again.

429
00:42:33,453 --> 00:42:35,512
I have another daughter.

430
00:42:45,198 --> 00:42:49,157
With her nails she'll flay
thy wolvish visage.

431
00:42:54,807 --> 00:42:58,208
I'll resume the shape

432
00:42:58,411 --> 00:43:02,370
which thou dost think
I have cast off for ever.

433
00:43:03,583 --> 00:43:05,016
Thou shalt find it,
I warrant thee!

434
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:13,484
Go to the Duchess of Cornwall
with these letters.

435
00:43:13,927 --> 00:43:17,988
If your diligence be not speedy,
I shall be there afore you.

436
00:43:18,197 --> 00:43:22,065
I will not sleep, my lord,
till I have delivered your letter.

437
00:43:30,644 --> 00:43:33,772
Nuncle, canst tell
why a snail has a house?

438
00:43:34,213 --> 00:43:35,180
No.

439
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:39,445
To put's head in,

440
00:43:39,652 --> 00:43:42,621
not to give it away
to his daughters,

441
00:43:42,822 --> 00:43:46,087
and leave his horns without a case.

442
00:43:52,932 --> 00:43:55,332
O, let me not be mad,
not mad, sweet heaven!

443
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:01,234
Keep me in temper:
I would not be mad!

444
00:44:59,132 --> 00:45:01,100
Brother, a word!

445
00:45:02,569 --> 00:45:04,764
Descend: Brother, I say!

446
00:45:08,107 --> 00:45:11,668
My father watches: Fly this place.

447
00:45:13,846 --> 00:45:15,814
Intelligence is given
where you are hid.

448
00:45:16,549 --> 00:45:19,074
You have now the good
advantage of the night.

449
00:45:25,859 --> 00:45:27,349
I hear my father coming.

450
00:45:28,728 --> 00:45:31,754
In cunning I must draw my sword
upon you. Seem to defend yourself.

451
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:34,357
Fly, brother!

452
00:45:34,567 --> 00:45:36,091
Torches, torches!

453
00:45:36,269 --> 00:45:37,361
So, farewell.

454
00:45:44,144 --> 00:45:46,908
Father, father! Stop, stop!
No help?

455
00:45:47,413 --> 00:45:49,347
Where's the villain?

456
00:45:49,616 --> 00:45:51,345
Here stood he,
his sharp sword out,

457
00:45:51,784 --> 00:45:54,412
conjuring the moon
to stand's auspicious mistress.

458
00:45:57,623 --> 00:45:59,818
Look, sir, I bleed.

459
00:46:00,427 --> 00:46:02,361
Where is the villain?

460
00:46:02,562 --> 00:46:05,360
Fled this way, sir,
when by no means he could...

461
00:46:05,565 --> 00:46:08,534
Pursue him, ho!
Go after.

462
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:12,003
By no means what?

463
00:46:12,205 --> 00:46:15,368
Persuade me to the murder
of your lordship.

464
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:06,392
How now, my noble friend!
I have heard strange news.

465
00:47:07,126 --> 00:47:10,493
If it be true, all vengeance comes too
short. How dost, my lord?

466
00:47:10,697 --> 00:47:13,598
O madam, my old heart is cracked,
is cracked!

467
00:47:14,434 --> 00:47:19,497
What, did my father's godson
seek your life? Your Edgar?

468
00:47:19,706 --> 00:47:21,901
O lady, shame would have it hid!

469
00:47:22,108 --> 00:47:24,736
Was he not companion with the riotous
knights that tend upon my father?

470
00:47:24,944 --> 00:47:27,845
I know not.
Tis too bad, too bad.

471
00:47:28,048 --> 00:47:30,016
Yes, madam, he was of that consort.

472
00:47:30,183 --> 00:47:32,913
No marvel, then, 'tis they have put
him on the old man's death,

473
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:36,088
to have the expense and waste
of his revenues.

474
00:47:36,289 --> 00:47:38,348
I have been from my sister
well informed of them.

475
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:42,751
If they come to sojourn at my house,
I'll not be there.

476
00:47:42,962 --> 00:47:45,931
Edmund, I hear that you have shown
your father a child-like office.

477
00:47:46,966 --> 00:47:49,434
- Is he pursued?
- Ay, my good lord.

478
00:47:49,869 --> 00:47:52,337
For you, Edmund,
whose virtue and obedience

479
00:47:52,538 --> 00:47:54,062
doth this instant
so much commend itself,

480
00:47:54,274 --> 00:47:57,971
you shall be ours.

481
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:18,588
You know not
why we came to visit you.

482
00:48:18,798 --> 00:48:20,766
Our father he hath writ, so hath
our sister, of differences,

483
00:48:20,967 --> 00:48:24,926
which I best thought it fit
to answer from your home.

484
00:48:25,305 --> 00:48:29,332
Lay comforts to your bosom,
and bestow your needful counsel

485
00:48:29,542 --> 00:48:31,510
to our business,
which craves the instant use.

486
00:48:31,845 --> 00:48:34,336
I serve you, madam,

487
00:48:34,547 --> 00:48:37,675
Your Graces are right welcome.

488
00:48:42,388 --> 00:48:44,151
Filthy coward!

489
00:48:46,259 --> 00:48:49,353
Draw, you rascal!
Come your ways!

490
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:51,427
Help, ho!

491
00:48:52,032 --> 00:48:55,365
Stand, rogue, stand!
You neat slave, strike!

492
00:48:55,735 --> 00:48:58,363
You come with letters
against the king?!

493
00:48:58,972 --> 00:49:00,234
What is the matter?

494
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,533
With you, goodman boy,
an you please?

495
00:49:02,742 --> 00:49:05,939
Weapons! Arms!
What's the matter here?

496
00:49:06,212 --> 00:49:09,204
Keep peace,
upon your lives!

497
00:49:09,949 --> 00:49:13,350
He dies that strikes again.
What is the matter?

498
00:49:13,553 --> 00:49:15,418
The messengers from our sister
and the king.

499
00:49:15,622 --> 00:49:19,217
- What is your difference? Speak.
- I am scarce in breath, my lord.

500
00:49:19,426 --> 00:49:21,360
No marvel. You cowardly rascal.

501
00:49:21,861 --> 00:49:24,659
One-trunk-inheriting slave,
a superserviceable rogue,

502
00:49:24,864 --> 00:49:27,355
one that wouldst be a bawd
in way of good service!

503
00:49:27,567 --> 00:49:29,057
Speak yet, how grew your quarrel?

504
00:49:29,268 --> 00:49:32,203
This ancient ruffian, whose life
I've spared at suit of his gray beard.

505
00:49:32,405 --> 00:49:36,205
Let me tread him into mortar, and
daub the wall of a jakes with him.

506
00:49:36,409 --> 00:49:39,435
Peace, sirrah! You beastly knave,
know you no reverence?

507
00:49:39,713 --> 00:49:42,773
Yes, sir,
but anger hath a privilege.

508
00:49:42,983 --> 00:49:44,007
Why art thou angry?

509
00:49:44,217 --> 00:49:47,448
That such a slave should wear a sword,
who wears no honesty.

510
00:49:48,855 --> 00:49:50,823
Such smiling rogues as these

511
00:49:51,458 --> 00:49:54,222
renege, affirm and turn their
halcyon beaks

512
00:49:55,195 --> 00:49:57,163
with every gale and vary
of their masters,

513
00:49:57,397 --> 00:49:59,763
knowing naught, like dogs,
but following.

514
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:03,362
Smile you my speeches,
as I were a fool?

515
00:50:03,536 --> 00:50:05,003
What, art thou mad, old fellow?

516
00:50:05,605 --> 00:50:06,902
How fell you out? Say that.

517
00:50:07,106 --> 00:50:10,769
No contraries hold more antipathy
than I and such a knave.

518
00:50:11,044 --> 00:50:13,376
- What's his offence?
- His countenance likes me not.

519
00:50:13,546 --> 00:50:16,913
No more, perchance, does mine,
nor his, nor hers?

520
00:50:17,217 --> 00:50:20,380
Sir, 'tis my occupation
to be plain:

521
00:50:21,287 --> 00:50:26,190
I have seen better faces in my time
than that I see this instant.

522
00:50:26,726 --> 00:50:28,193
Fetch forth the stocks!

523
00:50:29,529 --> 00:50:32,589
You reverend braggart,
we'll teach you!

524
00:50:33,366 --> 00:50:35,129
I am too old to learn.

525
00:50:35,535 --> 00:50:37,730
Call not your stocks for me.

526
00:50:40,273 --> 00:50:42,241
I serve the king, on whose
employment I was sent to you.

527
00:50:42,442 --> 00:50:45,070
You shall do small respect,
stocking his messenger.

528
00:50:45,712 --> 00:50:47,236
Fetch forth the stocks!

529
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:50,340
There shall he sit till noon.

530
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:54,916
Why, madam, if I were your father's
dog, not messenger...

531
00:50:55,121 --> 00:50:57,351
Sir, being his knave, I will!

532
00:50:58,191 --> 00:51:01,160
This is a fellow of the self-same
colour our sister speaks of.

533
00:51:01,394 --> 00:51:03,157
Let me beseech your Grace
not to do so.

534
00:51:03,396 --> 00:51:06,524
The good king his master
will check him for it.

535
00:51:06,733 --> 00:51:08,360
I'll answer that.

536
00:51:11,004 --> 00:51:12,904
Put in his legs!

537
00:51:21,715 --> 00:51:25,913
I am sorry for thee,
tis the duke's pleasure.

538
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:29,680
I'll entreat for thee.

539
00:51:29,889 --> 00:51:34,326
Pray, do not, sir,
I've watched, and travelled hard,

540
00:51:35,495 --> 00:51:39,693
a good man's fortune may grow out
at heels. Give you good morrow!

541
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,530
The duke's to blame in this.

542
00:51:56,182 --> 00:52:00,175
This strange that they should depart,
and not send back my messenger.

543
00:52:00,387 --> 00:52:04,756
As I learned, the night before there
was no purpose in them of this remove.

544
00:52:55,575 --> 00:52:57,839
Poor Tom's a-cold...

545
00:53:00,713 --> 00:53:02,943
The foul fiend follows me...

546
00:53:04,651 --> 00:53:05,777
Away!

547
00:53:06,419 --> 00:53:10,355
Croack not, black angel!
I have no food for thee.

548
00:53:15,095 --> 00:53:16,824
The foul fiend vexes him.

549
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:21,160
He hath led him through fire
and through flame...

550
00:53:23,269 --> 00:53:27,000
Fie, foh, and fum!

551
00:53:27,273 --> 00:53:33,678
Bless thee from whirlwinds,
star-blasting, and taking!

552
00:54:25,565 --> 00:54:27,931
Hail to thee, noble master!

553
00:54:38,478 --> 00:54:40,969
He wears cruel garters.

554
00:54:41,881 --> 00:54:45,578
Horses are tied by the heads,
dogs and bears by the neck,

555
00:54:45,785 --> 00:54:49,915
monkeys by the loins,
and men by the legs.

556
00:54:54,961 --> 00:54:56,690
When a man's over-lusty at legs,

557
00:54:57,030 --> 00:55:00,466
then he wears
wooden nether-stocks.

558
00:55:03,403 --> 00:55:05,371
What's he that hath so much
thy place mistook

559
00:55:06,039 --> 00:55:08,337
to set thee here?

560
00:55:09,342 --> 00:55:12,743
It is both he and she, -
your son and daughter.

561
00:55:13,246 --> 00:55:14,577
- No.
- Yes.

562
00:55:14,781 --> 00:55:16,681
- No, I say.
- I say, yes.

563
00:55:16,849 --> 00:55:18,339
No, no, they would not!

564
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:23,680
Winter's not gone yet,
if the wild-geese fly that way.

565
00:55:24,791 --> 00:55:27,760
Fathers that wear rags

566
00:55:28,394 --> 00:55:31,761
Do make their children blind,

567
00:55:32,131 --> 00:55:34,759
But fathers that bear bags

568
00:55:35,034 --> 00:55:37,525
Shall see their children kind.

569
00:55:42,408 --> 00:55:47,243
Fortune, that arrant whore,

570
00:55:48,414 --> 00:55:53,647
Ne'er turns the key to the poor.

571
00:55:56,456 --> 00:55:58,924
O, how this mother swells up
toward my heart!

572
00:56:00,627 --> 00:56:02,925
Down, thou climbing sorrow,

573
00:56:03,963 --> 00:56:06,830
thy element's below!

574
00:56:10,703 --> 00:56:12,068
Where is this daughter?

575
00:56:12,272 --> 00:56:13,830
With the earl, sir, here within.

576
00:56:17,811 --> 00:56:20,371
Follow me not!
Stay here.

577
00:56:33,259 --> 00:56:35,056
How chance the king comes
with so small a train?

578
00:56:37,263 --> 00:56:40,061
An thou hadst been set in the stocks
for that question,

579
00:56:40,266 --> 00:56:41,756
thou hadst well deserved it.

580
00:56:41,935 --> 00:56:43,368
Why, fool?

581
00:56:43,536 --> 00:56:47,768
Let go thy hold when a great
wheel runs down a hill,

582
00:56:48,808 --> 00:56:51,606
but the great one that goes up
the hill, let him draw thee after.

583
00:56:52,211 --> 00:56:54,304
Where learned you this, fool?

584
00:56:57,284 --> 00:57:00,685
Not in the stocks, fool.

585
00:57:03,656 --> 00:57:07,854
Deny to speak with me?
They have travelled all the night?

586
00:57:08,294 --> 00:57:09,591
Mere fetches.

587
00:57:09,763 --> 00:57:11,287
My dear lord!

588
00:57:11,698 --> 00:57:17,136
You know the fiery quality of the duke,
how unremovable he is in his course.

589
00:57:17,670 --> 00:57:22,130
Vengeance! Death!
Confusion! Fiery?

590
00:57:24,377 --> 00:57:28,677
Why, Gloster, Gloster, I'Id speak
with the duke and his wife!

591
00:57:28,948 --> 00:57:30,848
Well, my good lord, I have
informed them so.

592
00:57:31,050 --> 00:57:35,009
- Dost thou understand me, man?
- Ay, my good lord.

593
00:57:35,188 --> 00:57:36,678
The king would speak
with Cornwall,

594
00:57:36,956 --> 00:57:39,516
the dear father would
with his daughter speak:

595
00:57:39,726 --> 00:57:42,354
Are they informed of this?

596
00:57:42,562 --> 00:57:45,360
My breath and blood! No!

597
00:57:47,801 --> 00:57:50,326
Tell the hot duke that...

598
00:57:51,771 --> 00:57:54,899
No, but not yet.

599
00:57:57,176 --> 00:58:01,306
May be he is not well, infirmity
doth still neglect all office.

600
00:58:03,016 --> 00:58:05,985
I'll forbear. And am fallen out
with my more headier will,

601
00:58:07,287 --> 00:58:10,347
to take the indisposed and sickly
fit for the sound man.

602
00:58:11,624 --> 00:58:14,252
Death on my state!

603
00:58:14,794 --> 00:58:18,093
Wherefore should he
sit here?

604
00:58:19,299 --> 00:58:23,463
No, this remotion of the duke
and her is practice only.

605
00:58:24,304 --> 00:58:25,464
Give me my servant forth!

606
00:58:25,638 --> 00:58:27,105
Go tell the duke and's wife

607
00:58:27,307 --> 00:58:29,104
I'Id speak with them, now,
presently:

608
00:58:29,309 --> 00:58:33,143
Bid them come forth
and hear me,

609
00:58:33,613 --> 00:58:35,513
or at their chamber-door
I'll beat the drum

610
00:58:35,715 --> 00:58:38,343
till it cry sleep to death.

611
00:58:39,218 --> 00:58:41,686
I would have all well betwixt you.

612
00:58:43,123 --> 00:58:45,591
O me, my heart, my rising heart!

613
00:58:47,026 --> 00:58:49,358
But, down!

614
00:58:53,633 --> 00:58:56,193
- Good morrow to you both.
- Hail to your Grace!

615
00:58:56,402 --> 00:58:57,994
I am glad to see your highness.

616
00:58:58,204 --> 00:59:00,934
Regan, I think you are!

617
00:59:02,408 --> 00:59:04,103
O, are you free?

618
00:59:05,812 --> 00:59:07,370
Some other time for that.

619
00:59:08,748 --> 00:59:10,648
Beloved Regan,

620
00:59:11,384 --> 00:59:13,147
thy sister's naught.

621
00:59:13,386 --> 00:59:16,514
She hath tied sharp-toothed
unkindness, like a vulture, here.

622
00:59:16,956 --> 00:59:21,757
Thou'It not believe of how
depraved a quality - O Regan!

623
00:59:21,961 --> 00:59:25,920
Take patience, sir, I have hope you
less know how to value her desert.

624
00:59:26,466 --> 00:59:27,763
Say, how is that?

625
00:59:27,967 --> 00:59:31,835
I cannot think my sister in the
least would fail her obligation:

626
00:59:32,472 --> 00:59:35,168
If, sir, perchance she have
restrained the riots of your men...

627
00:59:35,408 --> 00:59:37,239
My curses on her!

628
00:59:37,610 --> 00:59:39,578
You should be ruled, and led
by some discretion

629
00:59:44,050 --> 00:59:47,076
that discerns your state
better than you yourself.

630
00:59:46,219 --> 00:59:52,454
Therefore, I pray you, that to
our sister you do make return.

631
00:59:50,256 --> 00:59:51,689
Say you have wronged her, sir.

632
00:59:56,930 --> 00:59:58,522
Ask her forgiveness?

633
00:59:58,631 --> 01:00:01,794
Dear daughter, I confess that
I am old; age is unnecessary.

634
01:00:00,733 --> 01:00:04,863
On my knees I beg that you'll
vouchsafe me raiment, bed and food.

635
01:00:04,637 --> 01:00:05,763
Good sir, no more.

636
01:00:08,942 --> 01:00:13,003
These are unsightly tricks.
Return you to my sister.

637
01:00:10,310 --> 01:00:11,675
Never, Regan!

638
01:00:14,814 --> 01:00:18,272
All the stored vengeances of heaven
fall on her ingrateful top!

639
01:00:16,716 --> 01:00:18,843
Strike her young bones,
you taking airs, with lameness!

640
01:00:20,887 --> 01:00:25,688
You nimble lightnings, dart your
blinding flames into her scornful eyes!

641
01:00:23,890 --> 01:00:26,552
Infect her beauty,
to fall and blast her pride!

642
01:00:29,562 --> 01:00:33,328
O the blest gods! So you will wish
on me,

643
01:00:32,565 --> 01:00:34,931
when the rash mood is on.

644
01:00:37,370 --> 01:00:40,567
No, Regan,
thou shalt never have my curse!

645
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:43,109
Thy tender-hefted nature shall not
give thee over to harshness.

646
01:00:44,477 --> 01:00:46,877
Thou better know'st the bond
of childhood;

647
01:00:48,281 --> 01:00:50,044
Thy half of the kingdom hast thou
not forgot,

648
01:00:51,384 --> 01:00:54,512
wherein I thee endowed.

649
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:55,085
Good sir, to the purpose.

650
01:00:57,557 --> 01:00:59,821
Who put my man in the stocks?

651
01:00:59,492 --> 01:01:00,982
I set him there, sir.

652
01:01:01,961 --> 01:01:05,397
But his own disorders
deserved much less advancement.

653
01:01:03,663 --> 01:01:08,532
O heavens, if you love old men, if
yourselves are old, take my part!

654
01:01:26,286 --> 01:01:28,413
O Regan, wilt thou take her
by the hand?

655
01:01:33,026 --> 01:01:35,756
Why not by the hand, sir?

656
01:01:35,795 --> 01:01:39,697
All's not offence
that indiscretion finds

657
01:01:38,965 --> 01:01:42,799
and dotage terms so.

658
01:01:43,036 --> 01:01:46,335
I am now from home, and out of that
provision which shall be needful.

659
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:49,406
Sojourn with my sister,
dismissing half your train.

660
01:01:50,543 --> 01:01:53,842
Return to her?
And fifty men dismist?

661
01:01:53,113 --> 01:01:56,571
No, rather I abjure all roofs.

662
01:01:57,717 --> 01:01:59,241
Return with her?

663
01:02:01,387 --> 01:02:04,356
Persuade me rather to be a slave
to this detested groom.

664
01:02:04,190 --> 01:02:06,715
- At your choice, sir.
- Daughter!

665
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:09,758
I prithee, do not make me mad.

666
01:02:12,465 --> 01:02:14,990
I will not trouble thee.

667
01:02:15,468 --> 01:02:17,936
Farewell, my child.

668
01:02:19,639 --> 01:02:22,540
We'll no more meet,
no more see one another.

669
01:02:23,209 --> 01:02:29,148
But yet thou art my flesh,
my blood, my daughter.

670
01:02:28,481 --> 01:02:32,076
Or rather a disease that's in
my flesh,

671
01:02:35,622 --> 01:02:38,921
which I must needs call mine,
thou art a boil,

672
01:02:40,627 --> 01:02:43,824
a plague-sore in my corrupted blood.

673
01:02:44,631 --> 01:02:45,996
But I'll not chide thee.

674
01:02:50,403 --> 01:02:53,998
Let shame come
when it will.

675
01:02:52,639 --> 01:02:57,269
Mend when thou canst.
I can be patient.

676
01:02:57,210 --> 01:03:00,179
I can stay with Regan,
I and my hundred knights.

677
01:03:02,982 --> 01:03:05,644
Not altogether so,
I looked not for you yet.

678
01:03:06,419 --> 01:03:09,183
If you will come to me,
I entreat you to bring

679
01:03:09,589 --> 01:03:12,057
but five-and-twenty knights.

680
01:03:12,525 --> 01:03:15,688
- I gave you all!
- And in good time you gave it.

681
01:03:15,194 --> 01:03:16,855
Made you my guardians,
my depositaries,

682
01:03:18,531 --> 01:03:21,295
but kept a reservation to be
followed with such a number.

683
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:23,494
What need you five-and-twenty, ten
or five, in a house

684
01:03:23,403 --> 01:03:25,530
where twice so many
have a command to tend you?

685
01:03:26,706 --> 01:03:28,173
What need one?

686
01:03:29,042 --> 01:03:31,169
O, reason not the need.

687
01:03:47,127 --> 01:03:52,190
Our basest beggars are in
the poorest thing superfluous.

688
01:03:51,264 --> 01:03:53,926
Allow not nature more than nature
needs,

689
01:03:57,937 --> 01:04:00,633
man's life is cheap as beast's.

690
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:04,134
You heavens, give me that patience!
Patience I need!

691
01:04:07,647 --> 01:04:10,616
You see me here, you gods,

692
01:04:14,887 --> 01:04:16,514
a poor old man.

693
01:04:18,725 --> 01:04:22,991
If it be you that stir these
daughters against their father,

694
01:04:21,494 --> 01:04:23,621
fool me not so much
to bear it tamely,

695
01:04:26,566 --> 01:04:30,002
touch me with noble anger.

696
01:04:29,903 --> 01:04:32,531
No, you unnatural hags, I will
have such revenges on you both

697
01:04:34,708 --> 01:04:36,608
that they shall be the terrors
of the earth.

698
01:04:37,777 --> 01:04:39,836
You think I'll weep?

699
01:04:45,018 --> 01:04:46,542
No, I'll not weep.

700
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:52,180
I have full cause of weeping,
but this heart shall break into

701
01:04:49,722 --> 01:04:51,690
a hundred flaws, or e'er I'll weep.

702
01:04:54,394 --> 01:04:58,353
O fool, I shall go mad!

703
01:05:21,254 --> 01:05:23,154
Most savage and unnatural!

704
01:05:38,872 --> 01:05:40,999
I like not this unnatural dealing!

705
01:05:40,974 --> 01:05:43,943
I have received a letter
and locked it in my closet.

706
01:05:44,811 --> 01:05:47,245
These injuries
the king now bears

707
01:05:48,281 --> 01:05:50,374
will be revenged.

708
01:05:50,950 --> 01:05:54,511
We must incline to the king.
I will seek him.

709
01:05:54,187 --> 01:05:56,348
Go you, and maintain talk with
the duke,

710
01:05:59,259 --> 01:06:01,693
that my charity be not
of him perceived.

711
01:06:01,628 --> 01:06:03,596
Pray you, be careful.

712
01:06:04,397 --> 01:06:06,365
This seems a fair deserving,

713
01:06:36,029 --> 01:06:40,398
and must draw me that
which my father loses.

714
01:06:38,798 --> 01:06:40,197
The younger rises when the old falls.

715
01:06:44,037 --> 01:06:47,370
End of Part One

716
01:06:51,893 --> 01:06:55,192
Part Two

717
01:07:58,527 --> 01:08:04,261
Blow, winds,
and crack your cheeks!

718
01:08:04,666 --> 01:08:05,860
You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout!

719
01:08:06,068 --> 01:08:11,199
And thou, all-shaking thunder, strike
flat the thick rotundity o'the world!

720
01:08:22,684 --> 01:08:27,053
Good nuncle, in,
and ask thy daughters' blessing.

721
01:08:27,255 --> 01:08:30,452
Here's a night pities
neither wise man nor fool.

722
01:08:36,298 --> 01:08:39,426
Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire,
are my daughters.

723
01:08:39,668 --> 01:08:42,034
I tax you not with unkindness.

724
01:08:42,738 --> 01:08:45,764
I never gave you kingdom,
called you children.

725
01:08:46,208 --> 01:08:48,335
You owe me no subscription.

726
01:08:49,311 --> 01:08:53,179
Then let fall
your horrible pleasure!

727
01:09:12,334 --> 01:09:13,858
But yet I call you servile ministers

728
01:09:15,137 --> 01:09:18,106
that have with two pernicious
daughters joined

729
01:09:19,608 --> 01:09:22,771
your high-engendered battles

730
01:09:23,311 --> 01:09:26,337
gainst a head so old and white
as this.

731
01:09:26,548 --> 01:09:29,278
O! 'tis foul!

732
01:09:30,552 --> 01:09:34,010
He that has a house
to put's head in

733
01:09:34,322 --> 01:09:37,723
has a good head-piece.

734
01:09:39,327 --> 01:09:42,023
The cod-piece that will house

735
01:09:42,831 --> 01:09:45,891
Before the head has any,

736
01:09:46,935 --> 01:09:49,802
The head and he shall louse, -

737
01:09:50,405 --> 01:09:53,602
So beggars marry many.

738
01:09:55,644 --> 01:09:59,102
No, I will be the pattern of
all patience.

739
01:09:59,281 --> 01:10:02,011
I will say nothing.

740
01:10:02,451 --> 01:10:04,180
Who's there?

741
01:10:04,820 --> 01:10:06,788
Marry, here's grace and a cod-piece,

742
01:10:08,423 --> 01:10:10,584
that's a wise man and a fool.

743
01:10:11,626 --> 01:10:13,025
Alas, sir, are you here?

744
01:10:13,295 --> 01:10:14,728
Tremble, thou wretch!

745
01:10:14,996 --> 01:10:20,195
That hast within thee
undivulged crimes,

746
01:10:20,402 --> 01:10:22,632
unwhipt ofjustice!

747
01:10:23,004 --> 01:10:28,032
Hide thee, thou bloody hand,
thou perjured!

748
01:10:28,243 --> 01:10:30,734
Cry these dreadful summoners grace!

749
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:33,641
I'm a man more sinned against

750
01:10:33,849 --> 01:10:35,441
than sinning.

751
01:10:35,650 --> 01:10:38,619
Gracious my lord,
hard by here is a hovel.

752
01:10:40,222 --> 01:10:43,851
My wits begin to turn.

753
01:10:48,663 --> 01:10:52,190
Come on, my boy, how dost, my boy?
Art cold?

754
01:10:52,734 --> 01:10:56,033
I am cold myself.

755
01:10:58,473 --> 01:11:02,967
Poor fool and knave,
I have one part in my heart

756
01:11:03,412 --> 01:11:05,107
that's sorry yet for thee.

757
01:11:17,059 --> 01:11:19,027
Here is the place, my lord, enter.

758
01:11:19,227 --> 01:11:21,787
- Let me alone.
- Enter here.

759
01:11:21,963 --> 01:11:23,430
Wilt break my heart?

760
01:11:23,665 --> 01:11:28,329
I had rather break my own.
Good my lord, enter.

761
01:11:29,237 --> 01:11:32,798
Thou think 'tis much that this
contentious storm invades us?

762
01:11:33,141 --> 01:11:35,439
Good my lord, enter here.

763
01:11:35,677 --> 01:11:37,804
Prithee, go in thyself,
seek thine own ease.

764
01:11:38,847 --> 01:11:42,044
This tempest will not give me leave
to ponder on things that hurt me more.

765
01:11:43,151 --> 01:11:45,278
But I'll go in.

766
01:11:48,557 --> 01:11:53,221
In, boy, go first.
You houseless poverty.

767
01:11:54,496 --> 01:11:56,088
I'll pray, and then I'll sleep.

768
01:12:37,906 --> 01:12:40,773
Poor naked wretches,

769
01:12:41,743 --> 01:12:45,179
that bide the pelting of this
pitiless storm,

770
01:12:47,149 --> 01:12:50,118
how shall your houseless heads
and unfed sides,

771
01:12:50,919 --> 01:12:54,616
your loopt and window'd raggedness,

772
01:12:55,757 --> 01:12:57,952
defend you from seasons such as these?

773
01:12:59,761 --> 01:13:04,130
O, I have taken too little care
of this!

774
01:13:05,233 --> 01:13:06,791
Take physic,

775
01:13:09,671 --> 01:13:11,366
pomp!

776
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:14,140
Expose thyself to feel

777
01:13:14,476 --> 01:13:18,105
what wretches feel.

778
01:13:25,153 --> 01:13:29,351
Fathom and half!
Poor Tom!

779
01:13:29,558 --> 01:13:33,119
Come not in here, nuncle,
here's a spirit.

780
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:40,197
Who's there? What art thou that
dost grumble i'the straw? Come forth.

781
01:13:40,836 --> 01:13:43,737
Away!
The foul fiend follows me!

782
01:13:45,841 --> 01:13:49,868
Through the sharp hawthorn
blows the cold wind.

783
01:13:50,846 --> 01:13:53,872
Go to thy cold bed,
and warm thee.

784
01:13:56,785 --> 01:14:01,017
Hast thou given all to thy two
daughters? And art thou come to this?

785
01:14:02,324 --> 01:14:04,349
Who gives any thing to poor Tom?

786
01:14:04,526 --> 01:14:08,428
Whom the foul fiend hath led through
fire and flame, over bog,

787
01:14:08,897 --> 01:14:12,355
made him course his own shadow

788
01:14:12,534 --> 01:14:14,263
for a traitor.

789
01:14:14,903 --> 01:14:17,098
Bless thy five wits!

790
01:14:23,145 --> 01:14:25,511
Didst thou give 'em all?
Couldst thou save nothing?

791
01:14:25,714 --> 01:14:27,511
He reserved his blanket.

792
01:14:28,250 --> 01:14:30,650
Else we had been all shamed.

793
01:14:30,852 --> 01:14:34,720
- He hath no daughters, sir.
- Death, traitor!

794
01:14:40,729 --> 01:14:43,254
Is it the fashion,

795
01:14:43,665 --> 01:14:46,429
that discarded fathers should have
thus little mercy on their flesh?

796
01:14:49,237 --> 01:14:50,602
Judicious punishment!

797
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:57,041
Twas this flesh begot
those pelican daughters.

798
01:14:57,979 --> 01:15:02,109
Pillicock sat on Pillicock-hill -
Halloo, halloo, loo, loo...

799
01:15:06,755 --> 01:15:13,217
This cold night will turn us all
to fools and madmen.

800
01:15:13,995 --> 01:15:17,226
Take heed of the foul fiend.
Tom's a-cold.

801
01:15:17,599 --> 01:15:19,760
Why, thou wert better in thy grave

802
01:15:20,302 --> 01:15:25,035
than to answer with thy uncovered
body this extremity of the skies.

803
01:15:27,609 --> 01:15:32,706
Is man no more
than this?

804
01:15:38,220 --> 01:15:39,653
Consider him well.

805
01:15:40,222 --> 01:15:44,659
Thou owest the worm no silk,
the beast no hide.

806
01:15:49,831 --> 01:15:53,892
Here's three on's are sophisticated!
Thou art the thing itself.

807
01:15:54,603 --> 01:15:56,468
Unaccommodated man

808
01:15:57,239 --> 01:16:03,337
is no more but such a poor,
bare, forkt animal

809
01:16:04,746 --> 01:16:06,270
as thou art.

810
01:16:08,550 --> 01:16:11,178
Off, off!

811
01:16:12,054 --> 01:16:14,022
You lendings!

812
01:16:17,059 --> 01:16:19,027
Come, unbutton here.

813
01:16:23,999 --> 01:16:28,732
Prithee, nuncle, be contented,
tis a naughty night to swim in.

814
01:16:29,004 --> 01:16:31,438
- How fares your Grace?
- It shall be done!

815
01:16:31,973 --> 01:16:33,531
I will arraign them straight!

816
01:16:36,244 --> 01:16:38,542
Come, sit thou here, most learned
justicer.

817
01:16:39,681 --> 01:16:41,706
Thou, sapient sir, sit here.

818
01:16:43,218 --> 01:16:45,709
Now, you she foxes!

819
01:16:46,988 --> 01:16:49,513
Will you lie down and rest upon
the cushions?

820
01:16:49,891 --> 01:16:52,860
Arraign her first.
Tis Goneril.

821
01:16:56,765 --> 01:17:00,792
I here take my oath
before this honourable assembly,

822
01:17:01,303 --> 01:17:02,964
she kicked

823
01:17:03,305 --> 01:17:07,139
the poor king
her father.

824
01:17:08,643 --> 01:17:12,875
And here's another,
whose warpt looks proclaim

825
01:17:14,249 --> 01:17:17,218
what store her heart
is made on.

826
01:17:21,823 --> 01:17:26,089
Stop her there!
Arms, arms, sword, fire!

827
01:17:27,662 --> 01:17:29,630
Corruption in the place!

828
01:17:30,132 --> 01:17:33,624
Then let them
anatomize Regan.

829
01:17:33,902 --> 01:17:38,202
See what breeds about her heart.
Is there any cause that makes it hard.

830
01:17:41,843 --> 01:17:44,607
You, sir, I entertain
for one of my hundred.

831
01:17:46,915 --> 01:17:48,974
Only I do not like the fashion
of your garments.

832
01:17:49,651 --> 01:17:51,812
Now, my good lord, lie here
and rest awhile.

833
01:17:52,020 --> 01:17:54,716
Make no noise, make no noise.

834
01:17:58,260 --> 01:18:00,228
Draw the curtains...

835
01:18:01,062 --> 01:18:03,587
So, so, so.

836
01:18:04,733 --> 01:18:08,794
We'll go to supper
in the morning.

837
01:18:09,137 --> 01:18:11,332
So, so, so.

838
01:18:12,474 --> 01:18:15,341
And I'll go to bed at noon.

839
01:18:19,247 --> 01:18:21,875
Who's there? What is't you seek?

840
01:18:24,252 --> 01:18:26,948
What are you there?
Your names?

841
01:18:27,556 --> 01:18:32,289
This is the foul fiend! He walks till
the first cock, he gives the web.

842
01:18:32,494 --> 01:18:34,052
Aroint thee, witch!

843
01:18:34,663 --> 01:18:36,062
What are you?

844
01:18:36,665 --> 01:18:38,462
My name is poor Tom!

845
01:18:38,867 --> 01:18:41,495
But mice and rats, and such small
deer,

846
01:18:41,736 --> 01:18:45,331
Have been Tom's food for seven long
year.

847
01:18:47,809 --> 01:18:50,277
What, have your Grace
no better company?

848
01:18:50,479 --> 01:18:53,937
Trouble him not. His wits are gone.

849
01:18:54,316 --> 01:18:58,184
I'll bring you where
both fire and food is ready.

850
01:18:58,620 --> 01:19:01,180
And drive towards Dover where thou
shalt meet welcome and protection.

851
01:19:01,490 --> 01:19:03,458
If thou shouldst dally, his life,
and ours, stand in assured loss.

852
01:19:03,692 --> 01:19:05,887
His daughters seek his death.

853
01:19:06,995 --> 01:19:11,125
Thou say'st
the king grows mad.

854
01:19:12,167 --> 01:19:14,192
I am almost mad myself.

855
01:19:15,237 --> 01:19:19,071
I had a son,
now outlaw'd from my blood.

856
01:19:21,009 --> 01:19:23,273
I will have my revenge!

857
01:19:23,812 --> 01:19:26,337
How, my lord,
I may be censured

858
01:19:26,548 --> 01:19:28,948
that nature thus
gives way to loyalty.

859
01:19:29,151 --> 01:19:31,711
O heavens!
That this treason were not,

860
01:19:31,987 --> 01:19:34,285
or not I the detector!

861
01:19:34,456 --> 01:19:36,617
The letter hath made thee
Earl of Gloster.

862
01:19:36,925 --> 01:19:38,893
I will persevere in my course of
loyalty,

863
01:19:39,227 --> 01:19:41,627
though the conflict be sore
between that and my blood.

864
01:19:41,997 --> 01:19:45,899
Post speedily to my lord your husband,
show him this letter.

865
01:19:46,568 --> 01:19:48,035
The army of France is landed.

866
01:19:48,336 --> 01:19:50,201
Seek out the traitor Gloster!

867
01:19:51,340 --> 01:19:53,035
Hang him instantly.

868
01:19:53,241 --> 01:19:55,732
Keep you our sister company.

869
01:19:55,944 --> 01:19:59,038
Advise the duke
to a most festinate preparation.

870
01:19:59,614 --> 01:20:02,447
Our posts shall be swift and
intelligent betwixt us.

871
01:20:02,651 --> 01:20:03,709
Where's the king?

872
01:20:03,885 --> 01:20:06,012
My Lord of Gloster hath conveyed him
hence.

873
01:20:19,234 --> 01:20:21,634
- Who's there? The traitor?
- Ingrateful fox! 'tis he.

874
01:20:21,837 --> 01:20:23,031
Bind fast his corky arms.

875
01:20:23,238 --> 01:20:27,265
Good my friends, consider you are
my guests: Do me no foul play.

876
01:20:27,476 --> 01:20:30,877
- Bind him, I say!
- Hard, hard! O filthy traitor!

877
01:20:31,079 --> 01:20:34,480
I'm none!

878
01:20:34,683 --> 01:20:36,150
To this chair bind him.

879
01:20:40,021 --> 01:20:41,045
What will you do?

880
01:20:41,256 --> 01:20:43,486
What letters had you late
from France?

881
01:20:43,692 --> 01:20:45,023
We know the truth.

882
01:20:45,527 --> 01:20:47,256
What confederacy have you with the
traitors late footed in the kingdom?

883
01:20:47,462 --> 01:20:49,623
- A letter not from one opposed.
- It's false.

884
01:20:49,831 --> 01:20:51,628
Where hast thou sent the king?

885
01:20:52,067 --> 01:20:54,092
- To Dover.
- Wast thou not charged at peril?

886
01:20:54,302 --> 01:20:55,701
Wherefore to Dover?

887
01:20:55,904 --> 01:20:57,804
I am tied to the stake, and I must
stand the course.

888
01:20:58,006 --> 01:20:59,473
Wherefore to Dover?

889
01:20:59,674 --> 01:21:03,974
Because I would not see thy cruel
nails pluck out his poor old eyes.

890
01:21:04,479 --> 01:21:07,277
But I shall see the winged vengeance
overtake such children.

891
01:21:07,482 --> 01:21:10,451
See't shalt thou never.
Fellows, hold the chair.

892
01:21:11,887 --> 01:21:14,651
Upon these eyes of thine
I'll set my foot.

893
01:21:16,024 --> 01:21:18,720
Give me some help! O cruel!

894
01:21:19,494 --> 01:21:21,462
One side will mock another;
the other too.

895
01:21:21,697 --> 01:21:23,062
If you see vengeance...

896
01:21:23,899 --> 01:21:25,264
Hold your hand.

897
01:21:25,634 --> 01:21:29,195
I have served you ever since I was
a child. I bid you, hold!

898
01:21:29,438 --> 01:21:30,871
How now, you dog!

899
01:21:31,073 --> 01:21:33,337
I bid you hold, too!
What do you mean?

900
01:21:33,542 --> 01:21:34,804
My villain!

901
01:21:36,144 --> 01:21:38,112
Nay, then, come on,
and take the chance of anger!

902
01:21:38,313 --> 01:21:39,473
A peasant stand up thus!

903
01:21:44,753 --> 01:21:48,450
My lord, you have one eye left...

904
01:21:48,690 --> 01:21:51,887
...to see some mischief on him.
- Lest it see more, prevent it.

905
01:22:05,474 --> 01:22:06,941
Edmund!

906
01:22:09,177 --> 01:22:12,772
Edmund! Edmund!

907
01:22:13,749 --> 01:22:17,276
All dark and comfortless!

908
01:22:17,552 --> 01:22:20,282
Edmund, enkindle all the sparks of
nature to quit this horrid act.

909
01:22:24,559 --> 01:22:27,050
Thou call'st on him
that hates thee.

910
01:22:27,229 --> 01:22:29,959
It was he that made the overture
of thy treason to us.

911
01:22:30,499 --> 01:22:33,297
O my follies!
Then Edgar was abused.

912
01:22:33,502 --> 01:22:34,560
Go thrust him out at gates!

913
01:22:34,770 --> 01:22:36,738
And let him smell his way to Dover.

914
01:22:36,938 --> 01:22:40,374
Turn out that eyeless villain.
Throw this slave upon the dunghill.

915
01:22:43,512 --> 01:22:45,412
Untimely comes this hurt.

916
01:22:49,384 --> 01:22:50,942
Give me your arm.

917
01:26:15,023 --> 01:26:17,423
Yet better thus,
and known to be contemn'd,

918
01:26:17,659 --> 01:26:20,184
than still contemn'd
and flatter'd.

919
01:26:21,329 --> 01:26:24,025
To be the worst, the lowest
thing of fortune,

920
01:26:25,067 --> 01:26:28,036
stands still in esperance,
lives not in fear.

921
01:26:29,071 --> 01:26:31,631
The lamentable change is from
the best.

922
01:26:32,474 --> 01:26:35,136
The worst returns to laughter.

923
01:26:36,178 --> 01:26:39,739
Welcome, then, thou unsubstantial
air that I embrace!

924
01:26:39,948 --> 01:26:42,041
The wretch that thou hast blown unto
the worst owes nothing to thy blasts.

925
01:26:53,662 --> 01:26:56,187
Away, good friend, be gone.

926
01:26:56,398 --> 01:26:59,424
Thy comforts can do me no good
at all, thee they may hurt.

927
01:27:00,469 --> 01:27:03,131
Alack, sir, you cannot see your way.

928
01:27:03,672 --> 01:27:07,733
I have no way,
and therefore want no eyes.

929
01:27:08,577 --> 01:27:11,375
I stumbled when I saw.

930
01:27:13,081 --> 01:27:15,140
O dear son Edgar!

931
01:27:16,184 --> 01:27:18,277
Might I but live
to see thee in my touch,

932
01:27:18,854 --> 01:27:21,379
I'ld say I had eyes again!

933
01:27:25,494 --> 01:27:29,828
Tis poor mad Tom.
Fellow, where goest?

934
01:27:31,833 --> 01:27:33,391
Is it the naked beggar-man?

935
01:27:33,669 --> 01:27:34,966
Madman and beggar too.

936
01:27:35,137 --> 01:27:37,469
He has some reason, else he could
not beg.

937
01:27:37,673 --> 01:27:39,868
In the last night's storm I such
a fellow saw.

938
01:27:40,842 --> 01:27:45,040
Which made me think
a man a worm.

939
01:27:46,148 --> 01:27:49,049
My son came then into my mind.

940
01:27:50,018 --> 01:27:52,282
I have heard more since.

941
01:27:54,089 --> 01:27:55,818
As flies to wanton boys,
are we to the gods.

942
01:27:56,425 --> 01:27:58,985
They kill us for their sport.

943
01:28:01,263 --> 01:28:03,288
I will entreat him to lead me.

944
01:28:03,498 --> 01:28:05,659
Alack, sir, he is mad.

945
01:28:09,304 --> 01:28:14,435
Tis the times' plague,
when madmen lead the blind.

946
01:28:14,843 --> 01:28:18,210
- Sirrah, naked fellow!
- Poor Tom's a-cold.

947
01:28:19,748 --> 01:28:21,340
Come hither, fellow.

948
01:28:23,318 --> 01:28:25,286
I cannot daub it further.

949
01:28:26,321 --> 01:28:28,050
And yet I must.

950
01:28:33,095 --> 01:28:35,359
Bless thy sweet eyes,
they bleed.

951
01:28:35,764 --> 01:28:38,665
Know'st thou the way to Dover?

952
01:28:38,934 --> 01:28:42,062
Both stile and gate,
horse-way and foot-path.

953
01:28:43,271 --> 01:28:47,230
Poor Tom hath been scared. Bless
thee, good man, from the foul fiend.

954
01:28:47,676 --> 01:28:49,371
Here, take this purse.

955
01:28:50,612 --> 01:28:53,103
- Dost thou know Dover?
- Ay, master.

956
01:28:53,315 --> 01:28:56,876
There's a cliff, whose high and
bending head looks in the deep.

957
01:28:57,486 --> 01:29:01,115
Bring me but to the very brim of it,
and I'll repair thou the misery.

958
01:29:01,823 --> 01:29:05,281
From that place
I shall no leading need.

959
01:29:09,164 --> 01:29:12,190
Give me thy arm.
Poor Tom shall lead thee.

960
01:29:44,566 --> 01:29:46,625
Welcome, my lord.

961
01:29:47,336 --> 01:29:49,896
I marvel our mild husband
not met us on the way.

962
01:29:50,072 --> 01:29:52,302
- Now, where's your master?
- Within, but never man so changed.

963
01:29:52,474 --> 01:29:54,499
I told him of the army that was
landed, he smiled at it.

964
01:29:54,676 --> 01:29:57,645
I told him you were coming,
his answer was, <<The worse. >>

965
01:29:58,213 --> 01:30:01,205
Of Gloster's treachery and of the
loyal service of his son when I

966
01:30:01,416 --> 01:30:04,908
informed him, then he called me sot,
and that I'd turned the wrong side out.

967
01:30:05,420 --> 01:30:08,821
Then shall you go no further.
It is the cowish terror of his spirit.

968
01:30:09,458 --> 01:30:13,121
Our wishes on the way
may prove effects.

969
01:30:13,295 --> 01:30:15,422
Back to my brother.
Hasten his musters

970
01:30:22,571 --> 01:30:24,129
and conduct his powers.

971
01:30:24,573 --> 01:30:26,200
Decline your head.

972
01:30:43,792 --> 01:30:47,696
I have been worth the whistle:
Become your head

973
01:30:47,696 --> 01:30:52,030
You are not worth the dust which
the rude wind blows in your face.

974
01:30:53,735 --> 01:30:55,703
She that herself will sliver and
disbranch from her material sap,

975
01:30:55,904 --> 01:30:59,499
perforce must wither,
and come to deadly use.

976
01:30:59,908 --> 01:31:02,968
No more! The text is foolish!

977
01:31:03,145 --> 01:31:06,205
Wisdom and goodness
to the vile seem vile,

978
01:31:06,415 --> 01:31:09,384
filths savour but themselves.

979
01:31:11,086 --> 01:31:14,283
What have you done?
Tigers, not daughters,

980
01:31:14,923 --> 01:31:17,050
what have you performed?

981
01:31:17,693 --> 01:31:19,217
Milk-liver'd man!

982
01:31:19,561 --> 01:31:22,997
That bear'st a cheek for blows,
a head for wrongs!

983
01:31:24,099 --> 01:31:27,728
Who hast not an eye discerning
thine honour from thy suffering.

984
01:31:27,936 --> 01:31:31,303
Where's thy drum? France spreads
his banners in our noiseless land.

985
01:31:31,640 --> 01:31:35,269
Whiles thou, a moral fool,

986
01:31:35,477 --> 01:31:37,707
sitt'st still, and criest:
<<Alack, why does he so? >>

987
01:31:38,313 --> 01:31:39,803
See thyself, devil!

988
01:31:40,482 --> 01:31:43,645
Proper deformity seems not in
the fiend so horrid as in woman.

989
01:31:51,093 --> 01:31:55,052
- What news?
- My lord, the Duke of Cornwall's dead.

990
01:31:55,497 --> 01:31:57,965
That shows you're above, that our
nether crimes so speedily can venge!

991
01:31:58,333 --> 01:32:01,894
This letter, madam, craves a speedy
answer. 'Tis from your sister.

992
01:32:02,104 --> 01:32:04,231
I'll read, and answer.

993
01:32:30,399 --> 01:32:34,062
Why the King of France
so suddenly gone back?

994
01:32:34,236 --> 01:32:37,205
Something he left imperfect
in the state required his return.

995
01:32:39,574 --> 01:32:41,906
O thou good Kent, how shall I live
and work to match thy goodness?

996
01:32:42,110 --> 01:32:43,737
My life will be too short,
and every measure fail me.

997
01:32:43,946 --> 01:32:46,471
To be acknowledged, madam,
is overpaid.

998
01:32:47,249 --> 01:32:48,682
A century send forth!

999
01:32:48,850 --> 01:32:51,216
Search every acre
in the high-grown fields.

1000
01:32:52,187 --> 01:32:54,348
What can man's wisdom
in the restoring his bereaved sense?

1001
01:32:54,556 --> 01:32:56,353
There is means, madam.

1002
01:32:56,558 --> 01:32:59,026
Our foster-nurse of nature is repose.

1003
01:32:59,995 --> 01:33:02,122
Seek, seek for him,

1004
01:33:02,931 --> 01:33:05,525
lest his ungoverned rage
dissolves his life!

1005
01:33:37,766 --> 01:33:43,796
No, they cannot touch me
for coining.

1006
01:33:44,840 --> 01:33:47,274
I have this right.

1007
01:33:50,679 --> 01:33:53,204
I am the king himself.

1008
01:33:55,851 --> 01:33:59,878
Nature's above art
in that respect.

1009
01:34:06,495 --> 01:34:08,827
There's your press-money.

1010
01:34:10,032 --> 01:34:12,762
That fellow handles his bow
like a crow-keeper.

1011
01:34:12,934 --> 01:34:15,869
Draw me a clothier's yard.

1012
01:34:17,305 --> 01:34:19,273
There's my gauntlet.

1013
01:34:19,474 --> 01:34:22,443
I'll prove it on a giant.

1014
01:34:24,079 --> 01:34:25,273
Give the word.

1015
01:34:25,914 --> 01:34:28,212
- Sweet marjoram.
- Pass.

1016
01:34:32,421 --> 01:34:36,448
Ha! Goneril!
With a white beard!

1017
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:42,724
They flattered me like a dog,

1018
01:34:43,498 --> 01:34:46,467
and told me I had white hairs
in my beard here.

1019
01:34:47,335 --> 01:34:52,238
To say 'ay' and 'no' to every
thing that I said!

1020
01:34:57,079 --> 01:35:01,345
There I smelt 'em out.
They are not men of their words.

1021
01:35:02,484 --> 01:35:04,452
They told me I was every thing.

1022
01:35:05,854 --> 01:35:07,879
Tis a lie. I'm not ague-proof.

1023
01:35:08,323 --> 01:35:10,814
Is't not the king?

1024
01:35:11,693 --> 01:35:14,958
Ay, every inch a king!

1025
01:35:15,931 --> 01:35:19,367
When I do stare,
see how the subject quakes!

1026
01:35:21,103 --> 01:35:23,469
I pardon that man's life.

1027
01:35:23,772 --> 01:35:28,141
What was thy cause? Adultery?
Die for adultery? No!

1028
01:35:30,879 --> 01:35:34,838
Let copulation thrive,
for I lack soldiers.

1029
01:35:39,087 --> 01:35:42,784
Give me an ounce of civet,
good apothecary,

1030
01:35:44,326 --> 01:35:47,887
to sweeten my imagination.

1031
01:35:55,003 --> 01:35:56,470
There's money for thee.

1032
01:35:57,939 --> 01:36:00,373
O, let me kiss that hand!

1033
01:36:02,244 --> 01:36:05,907
Let me wipe it first.
It smells of mortality.

1034
01:36:08,850 --> 01:36:10,818
Dost thou know me?

1035
01:36:11,353 --> 01:36:13,321
I remember thine eyes well enough.

1036
01:36:14,122 --> 01:36:16,022
Dost thou squiny at me?

1037
01:36:17,059 --> 01:36:20,961
Read thou this challenge.

1038
01:36:21,563 --> 01:36:24,031
Mark but the penning on't.

1039
01:36:24,399 --> 01:36:27,300
Were all the letters suns,
I could not see one.

1040
01:36:27,469 --> 01:36:31,303
- Read.
- What, with the case of eyes?

1041
01:36:31,473 --> 01:36:32,531
What, art mad?

1042
01:36:32,774 --> 01:36:35,902
A man may see how this world
goes with no eyes.

1043
01:36:36,244 --> 01:36:37,643
Look with thine ears.

1044
01:36:38,680 --> 01:36:41,808
See how yond justice rails
upon yond simple thief?

1045
01:36:42,684 --> 01:36:44,652
Hark, in thine ear:

1046
01:36:45,420 --> 01:36:48,446
Change places, and, handy-dandy,

1047
01:36:49,591 --> 01:36:52,651
which is the justice,
which is the thief?

1048
01:36:54,096 --> 01:36:56,223
Through tattered clothes
small vices do appear,

1049
01:36:56,398 --> 01:36:58,423
robes and furred gowns hide all.

1050
01:36:59,668 --> 01:37:03,434
Plate sin with gold, and the strong
lance ofjustice hurtless breaks.

1051
01:37:04,239 --> 01:37:08,608
Arm it in rags,
a pigmy's straw does pierce it.

1052
01:37:11,012 --> 01:37:13,742
None does offend, none.

1053
01:37:14,783 --> 01:37:17,274
I say, none!

1054
01:37:18,854 --> 01:37:21,152
I'll able 'em, take that of me

1055
01:37:21,690 --> 01:37:25,387
who have the power
to seal the accuser's lips.

1056
01:37:27,029 --> 01:37:29,224
Get thee glass eyes,

1057
01:37:29,865 --> 01:37:32,663
and, like a scurvy politician,

1058
01:37:33,702 --> 01:37:37,035
seem to see the things thou dost not.

1059
01:37:41,009 --> 01:37:44,877
Pull off my boots.
Harder, harder.

1060
01:38:20,248 --> 01:38:22,648
I know thee well enough.
Thy name is Gloster.

1061
01:38:24,152 --> 01:38:28,054
Thou must be patient.
We came crying hither,

1062
01:38:28,390 --> 01:38:31,359
the first time
that we smell the air,

1063
01:38:31,927 --> 01:38:34,225
we wawl and cry.

1064
01:38:35,697 --> 01:38:39,963
I will preach to thee:
Mark.

1065
01:38:40,168 --> 01:38:41,726
Alack, alack the day!

1066
01:38:42,337 --> 01:38:47,468
When we are born, we cry that we are
come to this great stage of fools.

1067
01:38:49,177 --> 01:38:50,838
It were a delicate stratagem

1068
01:38:51,713 --> 01:38:56,480
to shoe a troop of horse
with felt,

1069
01:38:57,019 --> 01:38:58,350
and when I have stolen

1070
01:38:59,154 --> 01:39:04,353
upon these sons-in-law,
then, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!

1071
01:39:05,093 --> 01:39:07,653
Sir, your most dear daughter...

1072
01:39:11,233 --> 01:39:12,666
No rescue?

1073
01:39:12,934 --> 01:39:16,062
Use me well,
you shall have ransom.

1074
01:39:18,006 --> 01:39:20,668
Let me have a surgeon.
I am cut to the brains.

1075
01:39:20,842 --> 01:39:23,072
You shall have any thing.

1076
01:39:23,412 --> 01:39:25,903
No seconds? All myself?

1077
01:39:26,114 --> 01:39:27,308
Good sir...

1078
01:39:27,516 --> 01:39:30,212
I will die bravely, like a smug
bridegroom.

1079
01:39:30,585 --> 01:39:32,815
I will be jovial. Come, come.

1080
01:39:33,355 --> 01:39:36,984
I am a king.
My masters, know you that.

1081
01:39:37,359 --> 01:39:39,884
You are a royal one,
and we obey you.

1082
01:39:41,663 --> 01:39:43,790
Then there's life in it.

1083
01:39:44,933 --> 01:39:48,630
Nay, an you get it,
you shall get it by running.

1084
01:40:00,248 --> 01:40:02,546
Thou old unhappy traitor!

1085
01:40:02,751 --> 01:40:05,379
The sword is out
that must destroy thee!

1086
01:40:05,787 --> 01:40:08,984
Now let thy friendly hand
put strength enough to it.

1087
01:40:09,691 --> 01:40:12,751
Let go, slave!
Out, dunghill!

1088
01:40:29,077 --> 01:40:31,045
Take my purse.

1089
01:40:31,246 --> 01:40:35,546
Give the letter which thou find'st
about me to Edmund earl of Gloster.

1090
01:40:36,485 --> 01:40:38,817
Seek him out upon the English party.

1091
01:40:49,031 --> 01:40:50,464
What, is he dead?

1092
01:40:50,866 --> 01:40:52,663
I'm only sorry he had no other
death's-man.

1093
01:40:56,438 --> 01:40:57,996
<<Let our reciprocal vows
be remembered.

1094
01:40:58,507 --> 01:41:01,271
His bed is my gaol,

1095
01:41:02,544 --> 01:41:04,034
from the warmth loathed whereof
deliver me.

1096
01:41:04,246 --> 01:41:07,875
Your wife, so I would say,
affectionate servant, Goneril.

1097
01:41:27,436 --> 01:41:29,301
How does the king?

1098
01:41:29,504 --> 01:41:31,301
Madam, sleeps still.

1099
01:41:31,573 --> 01:41:33,541
There are many simple operative

1100
01:41:34,176 --> 01:41:36,303
whose power will close the eye
of anguish.

1101
01:41:37,512 --> 01:41:39,480
O you kind gods!

1102
01:41:40,982 --> 01:41:43,348
Cure this great breach
in his abused nature!

1103
01:43:20,582 --> 01:43:23,312
So please your majesty
that we may wake the king.

1104
01:43:23,485 --> 01:43:25,646
- He hath slept long.
- Very well.

1105
01:43:37,499 --> 01:43:39,990
Please you, draw near.
Louder the music there!

1106
01:44:04,493 --> 01:44:06,222
O my dear father!

1107
01:44:09,264 --> 01:44:11,994
Restoration hang thy medicine
on my lips,

1108
01:44:12,200 --> 01:44:13,895
and let this kiss repair

1109
01:44:14,669 --> 01:44:17,638
those violent harms that my two
sisters have in thy reverence made!

1110
01:44:20,208 --> 01:44:22,642
Had you not been their father,
these white flakes

1111
01:44:23,845 --> 01:44:25,972
had challenged pity of them.

1112
01:44:29,017 --> 01:44:33,818
Mine enemy's dog should have stood
that night against my fire.

1113
01:44:37,559 --> 01:44:41,290
And wast thou fain, poor father, to
hovel thee in short and musty straw?

1114
01:44:50,438 --> 01:44:52,235
He wakes.
Speak to him.

1115
01:44:52,440 --> 01:44:54,135
Madam, do you; 'tis fittest.

1116
01:45:00,348 --> 01:45:02,839
How fares your majesty?

1117
01:45:07,689 --> 01:45:09,953
You do me wrong to take me out
of the grave.

1118
01:45:13,862 --> 01:45:15,454
Thou art a soul in bliss,

1119
01:45:16,331 --> 01:45:19,357
but I am bound
upon a wheel of fire.

1120
01:45:22,404 --> 01:45:24,065
Sir, do you know me?

1121
01:45:26,708 --> 01:45:29,905
You are a spirit, I know.
When did you die?

1122
01:45:31,413 --> 01:45:36,146
- Still, still, far wide!
- He's scarce awake.

1123
01:45:41,957 --> 01:45:43,652
Where have I been?

1124
01:45:48,997 --> 01:45:50,658
Where am I?

1125
01:45:51,566 --> 01:45:53,295
Fair daylight?

1126
01:46:00,575 --> 01:46:02,600
I am mightily abused.

1127
01:46:03,411 --> 01:46:06,209
O, look upon me, sir, and hold your
hands in benediction over me.

1128
01:46:12,721 --> 01:46:15,155
No, sir,
you must not kneel!

1129
01:46:16,058 --> 01:46:17,685
Pray, do not mock me.

1130
01:46:18,260 --> 01:46:20,694
I fear I am not in my perfect mind.

1131
01:46:22,731 --> 01:46:27,134
Methinks
I should know you,

1132
01:46:28,837 --> 01:46:31,032
and know this man.

1133
01:46:33,942 --> 01:46:36,035
And all the skill I have
remembers not these garments.

1134
01:46:37,345 --> 01:46:40,143
Nor I know not where I did lodge
last night.

1135
01:46:43,852 --> 01:46:45,820
Do not laugh at me!

1136
01:46:47,589 --> 01:46:50,820
For, as I am a man, I think this lady

1137
01:46:51,393 --> 01:46:53,827
to be my child Cordelia.

1138
01:46:54,196 --> 01:46:55,458
And so I am!

1139
01:47:00,969 --> 01:47:05,133
Be your tears wet?

1140
01:47:06,475 --> 01:47:07,806
Let me see.

1141
01:47:12,314 --> 01:47:14,214
Yes, faith.

1142
01:47:15,684 --> 01:47:20,451
I pray, weep not. If you have
poison for me, I will drink it.

1143
01:47:21,490 --> 01:47:23,219
I know you do not love me.

1144
01:47:23,425 --> 01:47:25,655
Your sisters have done me wrong.

1145
01:47:26,027 --> 01:47:28,757
You have some cause, they have not.

1146
01:47:29,331 --> 01:47:30,764
No cause, no cause.

1147
01:47:31,199 --> 01:47:35,067
Am I in France?

1148
01:47:35,804 --> 01:47:38,568
In your own kingdom, sir.

1149
01:47:39,607 --> 01:47:41,837
Do not abuse me.

1150
01:48:04,032 --> 01:48:05,829
You must bear with me.

1151
01:48:06,668 --> 01:48:09,136
Pray you now, forget and forgive.

1152
01:49:59,080 --> 01:50:02,379
Know of the duke
if his last purpose hold,

1153
01:50:02,651 --> 01:50:04,050
or whether since he is advised by
aught to change the course?

1154
01:50:06,254 --> 01:50:08,552
He's full of alteration.

1155
01:50:12,194 --> 01:50:13,661
Bring his constant pleasure.

1156
01:50:17,866 --> 01:50:20,061
Our sister's man is certainly
miscarried.

1157
01:50:20,268 --> 01:50:21,826
Tis to be doubted, madam.

1158
01:50:22,504 --> 01:50:24,062
Now, sweet lord,

1159
01:50:26,808 --> 01:50:29,800
you know the goodness I intend
upon you. Tell me, but truly...

1160
01:54:13,101 --> 01:54:15,661
Some officers take them away!
Good guard!

1161
01:54:19,107 --> 01:54:21,075
Until their greater pleasures first
be known that are to censure them.

1162
01:54:22,110 --> 01:54:26,240
Shall we not see these daughters
and these sisters?

1163
01:54:26,448 --> 01:54:29,679
No, no! Come,
let's away to prison.

1164
01:54:29,885 --> 01:54:32,649
We two alone will sing
like birds in the cage.

1165
01:54:33,155 --> 01:54:35,123
When thou dost ask me blessing,

1166
01:54:35,423 --> 01:54:38,620
I'll kneel down,
and ask of thee forgiveness.

1167
01:54:39,561 --> 01:54:42,724
So we'll live,
and pray,

1168
01:54:43,031 --> 01:54:46,228
and sing,
and tell old tales,

1169
01:54:46,434 --> 01:54:49,403
and laugh
at gilded butterflies,

1170
01:54:51,172 --> 01:54:55,074
and hear poor rogues
talk of court news.

1171
01:54:55,510 --> 01:54:57,842
And we'll talk with them too,
who loses and who wins,

1172
01:54:58,580 --> 01:55:00,480
who's in, who's out.

1173
01:55:01,116 --> 01:55:04,313
And we'll wear out,
in a walled prison,

1174
01:55:05,053 --> 01:55:06,680
packs and sects of great ones,

1175
01:55:07,122 --> 01:55:10,091
that ebb and flow by the moon.

1176
01:55:11,126 --> 01:55:12,650
Take them away!

1177
01:55:14,396 --> 01:55:18,230
My Cordelia, have I caught thee?
He that parts us

1178
01:55:18,566 --> 01:55:21,899
shall bring a brand from heaven,
and fire us hence like foxes.

1179
01:55:22,337 --> 01:55:24,066
Wipe thine eyes.

1180
01:55:25,107 --> 01:55:29,066
The good-years shall devour them,
ere they shall make us weep.

1181
01:55:37,352 --> 01:55:38,649
Come.

1182
01:55:45,427 --> 01:55:48,760
Captain, hark!
Go follow them to prison.

1183
01:55:49,197 --> 01:55:50,858
One step I have advanced thee.

1184
01:55:51,199 --> 01:55:54,134
If thou dost as this instructs thee,
thou dost make thy way still higher.

1185
01:55:55,236 --> 01:55:59,730
Know thou this,
that men are as the time is:

1186
01:56:00,408 --> 01:56:03,377
To be tender-minded
does not become a sword.

1187
01:56:04,613 --> 01:56:08,140
Edmund! Edmund!

1188
01:56:10,318 --> 01:56:13,082
Thy great employment will not bear
question: Either say thou'lt do't or...

1189
01:56:13,255 --> 01:56:16,486
I'll do it. I cannot draw a cart,
nor eat dried oats.

1190
01:56:16,791 --> 01:56:19,316
If it be man's work, I'll do it.

1191
01:56:42,083 --> 01:56:45,314
Sir, you have shown today your
valiant strain.

1192
01:56:46,187 --> 01:56:47,916
And fortune led you well.

1193
01:56:48,957 --> 01:56:52,757
You have the captives.
We do require them of you.

1194
01:56:53,495 --> 01:56:57,761
So to use them
as we shall find their merits

1195
01:56:59,100 --> 01:57:02,331
and our safety
may equally determine.

1196
01:57:03,105 --> 01:57:06,632
I thought it fit to send the old king
to some retention and appointed guard.

1197
01:57:07,609 --> 01:57:09,577
His age has charms in it, his title
more,

1198
01:57:10,212 --> 01:57:12,476
to pluck the common bosom
on his side.

1199
01:57:13,248 --> 01:57:17,150
Sir, by your patience, I hold you a
subject of this war, not as a brother.

1200
01:57:17,485 --> 01:57:20,215
That's as we list to grace him.

1201
01:57:20,422 --> 01:57:23,653
He led our powers, bore the
commission of my place and person.

1202
01:57:23,858 --> 01:57:28,227
Not so hot: In his own grace he doth
exalt himself, not your addition.

1203
01:57:28,597 --> 01:57:30,292
In my rights by me invested,
he compeers the best.

1204
01:57:30,498 --> 01:57:32,557
That were the most,
if he should husband you.

1205
01:57:33,602 --> 01:57:35,900
Jesters do oft prove prophets.

1206
01:57:38,940 --> 01:57:41,306
That eye that told you so
looked but a-squint.

1207
01:57:41,877 --> 01:57:45,574
General! Witness the world that I
create thee here my lord and master.

1208
01:57:46,514 --> 01:57:47,776
Mean you to enjoy him?

1209
01:57:47,949 --> 01:57:50,008
The let-alone lies not in your
good will.

1210
01:57:50,285 --> 01:57:51,684
Nor in thine, lord.

1211
01:57:52,921 --> 01:57:54,650
Let the drum strike, and prove
my title thine.

1212
01:57:54,856 --> 01:57:58,121
Stay yet. Edmund, I arrest thee.

1213
01:57:59,494 --> 01:58:02,463
On capital treason.

1214
01:58:03,765 --> 01:58:07,292
For your claim, fair sister,
I bar it in the interest of my wife.

1215
01:58:08,103 --> 01:58:10,003
Tis she is sub-contracted
to this lord.

1216
01:58:10,172 --> 01:58:11,469
An interlude!

1217
01:58:12,274 --> 01:58:15,732
Thou art armed, Gloster.
Let the trumpet sound.

1218
01:58:16,278 --> 01:58:19,247
If none appear to prove
upon thy person

1219
01:58:19,581 --> 01:58:22,550
thy heinous, manifest,
and many treasons,

1220
01:58:25,720 --> 01:58:27,153
there is my pledge.

1221
01:58:28,790 --> 01:58:32,317
- Sick, O, sick!
- If not, I'll never trust medicine.

1222
01:58:33,128 --> 01:58:34,652
There's my exchange.

1223
01:58:35,263 --> 01:58:37,959
What in the world he is
that names me traitor,

1224
01:58:38,166 --> 01:58:40,361
villain-like he lies.

1225
01:58:41,336 --> 01:58:44,066
- A herald, ho!
- Come hither, herald!

1226
01:58:44,506 --> 01:58:46,474
Let the trumpet sound,
and read out this.

1227
01:58:53,515 --> 01:58:57,474
If any man of quality or degree
within the lists of the army

1228
01:58:57,719 --> 01:58:59,983
will maintain

1229
01:59:00,188 --> 01:59:03,316
upon Edmund, supposed Earl of
Gloster, that he's a manifold traitor,

1230
01:59:03,792 --> 01:59:08,491
let him appear by the third
sound of the trumpet.

1231
02:00:05,020 --> 02:00:08,820
Ask him his purposes, why he appears
upon this call of the trumpet.

1232
02:00:09,357 --> 02:00:13,555
What are you? Your name, your
quality?

1233
02:00:14,029 --> 02:00:16,759
And why you answer this present
summons?

1234
02:00:17,799 --> 02:00:23,066
Know, my name is lost, by treason's
tooth bare-gnawn and canker-bit.

1235
02:00:23,271 --> 02:00:26,934
Yet am I noble as the adversary
I come to cope.

1236
02:00:27,809 --> 02:00:29,674
Which is that adversary?

1237
02:00:29,878 --> 02:00:31,573
Thou art a traitor!

1238
02:00:31,780 --> 02:00:34,681
And, from thy head to the descent

1239
02:00:34,883 --> 02:00:37,818
and dust below thy foot,
a most toad-spotted traitor.

1240
02:00:38,086 --> 02:00:40,054
Back do I toss these treasons
to thy head!

1241
02:00:40,255 --> 02:00:41,654
Trumpets, speak!

1242
02:03:01,029 --> 02:03:03,759
- Save him, save him!
- Thou art but cozen'd and beguiled.

1243
02:03:03,965 --> 02:03:05,330
Shut your mouth, dame!

1244
02:03:05,533 --> 02:03:07,933
Or with this paper shall I stop it!

1245
02:03:09,204 --> 02:03:11,764
No tearing, lady.
I perceive you know it.

1246
02:03:12,207 --> 02:03:14,937
Say, if I do!
The laws are mine, not thine.

1247
02:03:15,610 --> 02:03:17,237
Who can arraign me for it?

1248
02:03:18,246 --> 02:03:22,444
Most monstrous!
Know'st thou this paper?

1249
02:03:23,018 --> 02:03:25,646
Ask me not what I know.

1250
02:03:35,797 --> 02:03:38,459
Go after her, she's desperate,
govern her.

1251
02:03:53,715 --> 02:03:57,344
What you have charged me with, that
have I done, and more, much more.

1252
02:04:02,791 --> 02:04:04,759
But what art thou?

1253
02:04:12,034 --> 02:04:15,993
The wheel is come
full circle.

1254
02:04:31,353 --> 02:04:34,083
Let sorrow
split my heart,

1255
02:04:34,289 --> 02:04:36,519
if ever I did hate thee
or thy father!

1256
02:04:36,725 --> 02:04:38,022
I know it.

1257
02:04:38,526 --> 02:04:42,394
Where have you hid yourself? How
have you known thy father's miseries?

1258
02:04:43,265 --> 02:04:44,823
By nursing them.

1259
02:04:45,433 --> 02:04:47,401
O, our lives' sweetness!

1260
02:04:48,436 --> 02:04:50,666
That we the pain of death
would hourly die

1261
02:04:51,273 --> 02:04:53,833
rather than die at once!

1262
02:04:55,110 --> 02:04:57,078
- What now?
- O, she's dead!

1263
02:04:57,279 --> 02:04:59,247
Who dead? Speak, man.

1264
02:04:59,448 --> 02:05:01,416
Your lady, sir.

1265
02:05:01,583 --> 02:05:04,552
And her sister
by her is poisoned.

1266
02:05:04,886 --> 02:05:06,478
She hath confest it.

1267
02:05:07,289 --> 02:05:08,688
Produce their bodies.

1268
02:05:09,357 --> 02:05:13,259
This judgement of the heavens,
that makes us tremble.

1269
02:05:15,964 --> 02:05:18,159
I was contracted to them both.

1270
02:05:18,366 --> 02:05:21,529
All three now marry
in an instant.

1271
02:05:35,183 --> 02:05:36,844
I pant for life.

1272
02:05:38,286 --> 02:05:40,914
Some good I mean to do,

1273
02:05:42,424 --> 02:05:44,392
despite of mine own nature.

1274
02:05:48,330 --> 02:05:50,696
Quickly send to the castle!

1275
02:05:50,966 --> 02:05:53,992
For my writ is on the life
of Lear and on Cordelia.

1276
02:05:55,370 --> 02:05:59,329
Quickly send to the castle!

1277
02:06:00,108 --> 02:06:02,975
For my writ is on the life
of Lear and on Cordelia.

1278
02:06:03,712 --> 02:06:05,202
Run, run, O, run!

1279
02:06:31,139 --> 02:06:37,237
Howl, howl, howl, howl!

1280
02:06:38,380 --> 02:06:41,816
O, you are men of stone!

1281
02:06:43,485 --> 02:06:46,045
Had I your tongues and eyes,

1282
02:06:46,354 --> 02:06:48,652
I'ld use them so that heaven's
vault should crack!

1283
02:06:52,194 --> 02:06:54,662
She's gone for ever...

1284
02:06:55,964 --> 02:06:58,660
I know when one is dead,
and when one lives.

1285
02:06:59,601 --> 02:07:01,660
She's dead as earth.

1286
02:07:03,872 --> 02:07:07,239
Is this the promised end?

1287
02:07:07,609 --> 02:07:09,577
Or image of that horror?

1288
02:07:09,778 --> 02:07:11,939
Fall, and cease!

1289
02:07:12,614 --> 02:07:15,412
This feather stirs. She lives!

1290
02:07:16,284 --> 02:07:18,081
If it be so, it is a chance

1291
02:07:18,286 --> 02:07:20,049
which does redeem all sorrows
that ever I have felt.

1292
02:07:20,722 --> 02:07:23,657
- O my good master!
- Prithee, away.

1293
02:07:24,025 --> 02:07:26,289
A plague upon you, murderers,
traitors all!

1294
02:07:27,495 --> 02:07:29,292
I might have saved her!

1295
02:07:30,699 --> 02:07:33,896
Now she's gone for ever!

1296
02:07:34,803 --> 02:07:40,241
Cordelia, Cordelia!
Stay a little!

1297
02:07:41,443 --> 02:07:42,842
What is't thou say'st?

1298
02:07:45,280 --> 02:07:48,249
Her voice was ever soft, gentle,
and low, -

1299
02:07:48,517 --> 02:07:51,247
an excellent thing in woman.

1300
02:07:52,454 --> 02:07:55,014
Who are you? Mine eyes are not
o'the best.

1301
02:07:55,757 --> 02:07:58,851
- Your servant Kent.
- He was a good fellow.

1302
02:07:59,294 --> 02:08:02,821
He'll strike, and quickly too...
He's dead and rotten.

1303
02:08:03,031 --> 02:08:05,295
No, my good lord. I am the very man.

1304
02:08:10,705 --> 02:08:14,072
And my poor fool is hanged.

1305
02:08:16,178 --> 02:08:18,237
No, no, no life!

1306
02:08:20,048 --> 02:08:24,542
Why should a dog, a horse, a rat,
have life,

1307
02:08:25,186 --> 02:08:29,145
and thou no breath at all?
Thou'lt come no more.

1308
02:08:30,792 --> 02:08:35,024
Never, never, never!

1309
02:08:36,298 --> 02:08:38,425
Never, never!

1310
02:08:49,778 --> 02:08:52,144
Pray you,
undo this button.

1311
02:08:52,514 --> 02:08:53,742
Thank you, sir.

1312
02:08:53,949 --> 02:08:57,248
Do you see this? Look on her.
Look, her lips.

1313
02:08:57,419 --> 02:08:59,751
Look there!

1314
02:09:00,889 --> 02:09:02,686
Look up, my lord!

1315
02:09:03,125 --> 02:09:06,754
Vex not his ghost.
O, let him pass!

1316
02:09:07,963 --> 02:09:10,989
He hates him that would upon
the rack of this tough world

1317
02:09:11,199 --> 02:09:13,326
stretch him out longer.

1318
02:09:19,307 --> 02:09:21,002
Bear them from hence.

1319
02:09:23,345 --> 02:09:26,473
Our present business
is general woe.

1320
02:09:29,718 --> 02:09:32,084
Friends of my soul,

1321
02:09:32,420 --> 02:09:35,150
you twain rule in this realm,
and the gored state sustain.

1322
02:09:35,957 --> 02:09:38,926
I have a journey, sir,
shortly to go.

1323
02:09:39,961 --> 02:09:41,758
My master calls me.

1324
02:09:42,798 --> 02:09:44,698
I must not say no.

1325
02:11:40,348 --> 02:11:44,682
The End
