1
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:14,470
I heard this big bang and then
the building is falling down!

2
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:16,270
It looks like a second plane.

3
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:20,109
- The US military has begun strikes.
- ...cases of anthrax...

4
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:24,742
We need every tool that's available to us.
Tools that respect...

5
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:28,743
My focus is bringing
al-Qaeda to justice.

6
00:01:28,788 --> 00:01:33,088
Say, theoretically, that the
government of the United States

7
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:36,391
could rid the world
of terrorism forever,

8
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:39,057
but only if for a single day,

9
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:43,263
you gave up all of your
rights as American citizens.

10
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:47,740
24 hours with no rights. What
would you say? Would you do it?

11
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,469
Sure.

12
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:54,310
OK. The government says it could rid
the world of terrorism forever...

13
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:57,675
if you give up all of
your rights for...

14
00:01:58,985 --> 00:01:59,974
a week.

15
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:02,419
Would you do it? Come on.
A week.

16
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,616
A week. A week, all right?

17
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:06,747
A month?

18
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:11,254
A year? A year.

19
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:13,094
Just a year.

20
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,794
Ten years?

21
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:16,563
- Ten years.
- No.

22
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:18,366
A lifetime.

23
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:21,271
Absolutely not. No way.

24
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,751
Sorry. Sorry.

25
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,020
Are you uncomfortable?

26
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,991
I'll bet you are uncomfortable.

27
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,598
Do you promise to behave?

28
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:39,106
How's that?

29
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:40,840
That's better.

30
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:50,152
I'm a public servant.

31
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:51,781
I'm here to serve.

32
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:54,383
Why am I here?

33
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,656
Were you hurt when the
officers arrested you?

34
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,031
Arrested?

35
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:04,559
I told them to be respectful.

36
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:09,906
Why have I been arrested? I
haven't done anything wrong.

37
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:23,552
Filthy habit.

38
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:25,022
Unhealthy.

39
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:27,856
Listen. I know that
I'm a foreigner,

40
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:33,355
and as such I may not be aware of
all the laws that you people have,

41
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:36,891
but I swear I can't imagine
what crime I've committed.

42
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:40,565
- How long have you been in this country?
- A year. Maybe a little more.

43
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:43,575
I can see how that may not be
enough time to learn our laws.

44
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:45,634
Not all of them, no. Basics.

45
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:49,638
You know, the ones that
are common everywhere.

46
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:53,140
- Against murder and stealing...
- Perhaps I misspoke.

47
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:57,816
You were not arrested. You've simply
been brought in for questioning.

48
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,381
An interrogation?

49
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:01,550
An interview.

50
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:03,494
Because I'm a suspect?

51
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:08,361
A subject of an inquiry.

52
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:10,631
An investigation...

53
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,932
into crimes,

54
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:15,771
some of which may not as
yet have been committed.

55
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:19,407
You think I may commit a crime?

56
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:22,541
Anyone is capable

57
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:25,847
given the proper circumstance.

58
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,046
My own mother...

59
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:32,285
was arrested for shoplifting.

60
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:34,316
She's an old lady.

61
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:37,989
I have no criminal record,

62
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:41,193
no prior arrests either
here or at home.

63
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:43,432
Good.

64
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:49,068
I'd like to see a lawyer,

65
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:50,735
contact my embassy.

66
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:53,536
Why?

67
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:58,477
Because, not knowing the
local laws, I'm afraid...

68
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:00,247
That you will indict yourself?

69
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:02,386
No.

70
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,655
I...

71
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:07,056
don't know my rights.

72
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,720
You haven't read me my rights.

73
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,255
That's because...

74
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:16,632
you are not charged
with anything.

75
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:19,566
Then I can go?

76
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,334
No.

77
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:26,439
- No.
- I can be held without being charged?

78
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:27,605
Yes.

79
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:29,012
For how long?

80
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:32,848
48 hours. Seven days, six
months, however long it takes.

81
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:34,318
Takes for what?

82
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:35,786
You to tell me what I need.

83
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:38,382
You mean confess?

84
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:43,020
Confess to a crime that may or
may not have been committed?

85
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:45,656
That I may have committed
not knowing it was a crime

86
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:47,495
or that may not even
be a crime yet?

87
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:17,385
The photograph doesn't do you
justice, you're much more handsome.

88
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,655
Or maybe the word is pretty.

89
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,962
Look...

90
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,663
You've certainly been
to plenty of places.

91
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:27,036
Russia, Cyprus.

92
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:29,301
Venezuela.

93
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,644
Israel. You're not Jewish.

94
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:39,582
Indonesia. Now there's
a hotbed of terrorism.

95
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:41,450
What were you doing there?

96
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:44,388
- None of your business.
- Sit down.

97
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,618
Please.

98
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:53,830
Oh.

99
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,198
It's hot in here.

100
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,966
Yes. That time of year.

101
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:32,302
Sometimes...

102
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:36,069
the best thing to do
is to just sweat.

103
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,759
- What are you doing?
- Easy, man.

104
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:08,137
I'll break you up. Get down.
Stay down.

105
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,097
Aargh!

106
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:13,309
All right, buddy, let's go.

107
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:15,741
Head down.

108
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:17,540
Right. Come on.

109
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,278
Come on.

110
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:20,808
Move it.

111
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:22,013
Come on.

112
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:23,851
- Watch your head.
- Get in.

113
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:25,823
- Easy.
- Let's go.

114
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:35,430
My government has started fingerprinting
foreigners from certain countries.

115
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:38,365
But I don't think that's enough.

116
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:42,807
I think maybe the best solution
is to put ankle bracelets,

117
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:45,834
monitoring devices,
on specific visitors.

118
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:47,004
Not you.

119
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:50,946
In order to keep an eye
on their movements.

120
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,644
That way...

121
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:55,415
we know where they go,
who they associate with,

122
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:57,319
what they're up to.

123
00:10:57,356 --> 00:10:59,187
Anyway, that's what I think.

124
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:01,056
But who am I?

125
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:05,525
Just a lowly cog
in a rusty wheel.

126
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:06,929
Ignored.

127
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:09,764
Unappreciated.

128
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:11,662
Underpaid.

129
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,140
Can you identify this man?

130
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:21,570
No. Who is he?

131
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:26,576
I don't know. I was
hoping you could tell me.

132
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:31,388
We think he might be a natural-born
citizen, but we're not sure.

133
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:35,451
See, that's the problem with my
concept about the ankle bracelets.

134
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:39,692
One does not have to be a
foreigner to be disloyal.

135
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:42,667
Disloyal? What do you
consider disloyal?

136
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:47,063
Speaking negatively
about our government.

137
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:49,438
Criticizing our leaders.

138
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:53,912
That's dissent. There's a difference
between disloyalty and dissent.

139
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:57,278
I'm sure in your mind...

140
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:00,744
that's true.

141
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:39,647
Are you uncomfortable?

142
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:43,461
I bet you're uncomfortable.

143
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,988
Do you promise to behave?

144
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:56,968
How's that?

145
00:12:58,043 --> 00:12:59,340
Better.

146
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:02,505
I'm a public servant.
I'm here to serve.

147
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:04,643
Why am I here?

148
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:07,743
Were you hurt when the
officers arrested you?

149
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,049
Arrested?

150
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:11,022
I told them to be respectful.

151
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:15,149
Why have I been... arrested?

152
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:16,491
I...

153
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:21,694
- I haven't done anything wrong.
- That's a filthy habit.

154
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:24,035
It's unhealthy.

155
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:28,495
Listen.

156
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:31,738
I know that I am a foreigner

157
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:37,215
and as such I may not be aware of
all the laws you people have...

158
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:41,284
but I can't imagine what
crime I've committed.

159
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,447
How long have you
been in this country?

160
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,513
A year.

161
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:46,081
Maybe a little more.

162
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:50,323
Well, I can see why that may not
be enough time to learn our laws.

163
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:52,330
Well, not all of them.

164
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:53,524
No.

165
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:56,658
The basics.

166
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:59,398
The ones that are
common everywhere.

167
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,670
You know.

168
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:03,538
Against murder or stealing...

169
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:08,707
Perhaps I misspoke. You were not arrested.
You've simply been brought in for questioning.

170
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:10,510
- An interrogation.
- An interview.

171
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,445
Because...

172
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:14,579
I'm a suspect?

173
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,554
Subject of an inquiry,

174
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:20,650
an investigation into crimes, some of
which may not as yet have been committed.

175
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:24,595
Oh, you think I may
commit a crime?

176
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,724
Anyone's capable given the
proper circumstances.

177
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:31,202
My own mother was arrested for
shoplifting, she's an old lady.

178
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:33,000
I have no criminal record,

179
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:36,804
no prior arrests or convictions
either here or at home.

180
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:39,367
- Good.
- I would like to see a lawyer,

181
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:40,878
contact my embassy.

182
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:42,005
Why?

183
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:45,574
Because, not knowing
the local laws,

184
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:48,348
- I am afraid that...
- You will indict yourself?

185
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:53,249
No.

186
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:56,894
I don't know my rights.

187
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:59,898
You haven't read me my rights.

188
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,701
That's because you aren't
charged with anything.

189
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,034
Then I can go?

190
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:10,707
- No.
- I can be held without being charged?

191
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:13,644
- Yes.
- For how long?

192
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:16,308
48 hours.

193
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:18,213
Seven days.

194
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,877
Six months.

195
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,944
However long it takes.

196
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:23,477
Takes for what?

197
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:25,251
You to tell me what I need.

198
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,054
You mean confess.

199
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:34,063
Confess to a crime that may or
may not have been committed.

200
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:39,298
That I may have committed not
knowing it's a crime or...

201
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:41,533
that may not even be a crime!

202
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:43,497
Yet!

203
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:15,772
Photograph doesn't
do you justice.

204
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,673
You're much more handsome.

205
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:22,010
Or maybe the word's...

206
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:23,139
pretty.

207
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,076
Look...

208
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:28,314
Ooh. You've been
to so many places.

209
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:31,085
Russia.

210
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:33,486
Cyprus.

211
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:34,924
Venezuela.

212
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,484
Israel.

213
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:39,057
You're not Jewish.

214
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:41,726
Indonesia.

215
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:46,227
Now, there's a hotbed of terrorism.
What were you doing there?

216
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:50,139
It's none of your business.

217
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,540
Sit down.

218
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:54,337
Please.

219
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,218
- It's hot in here.
- Hm.

220
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:07,850
Yes.

221
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:09,758
It's that time of year.

222
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:15,392
Sometimes the best thing
to do is to just...

223
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:16,924
sweat.

224
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:22,400
My government has started fingerprinting
foreigners from certain countries,

225
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:24,500
but I'm not sure that's enough.

226
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:29,742
Maybe the best solution would be
to put ankle bracelets, you know,

227
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:33,548
monitoring devices, on specific visitors.
I mean, not you.

228
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:37,219
In order to keep an eye
on their movements.

229
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:39,383
That way we'll know
where they go,

230
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:41,393
who they associate with,

231
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:42,860
what they're up to.

232
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,492
Anyway...

233
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:48,466
that's what I think, but...

234
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:50,892
who am I?

235
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:55,766
Just a lowly cog
in a rusty wheel.

236
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,605
Ignored, unappreciated.

237
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:02,746
Underpaid.

238
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,333
Can you identify this man?

239
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,262
No. Who is he?

240
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,963
I don't know.

241
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:31,532
I was hoping you could tell me.

242
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:35,843
We think he might be a natural-born
citizen, but we're not sure.

243
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:39,749
You see, that's the problem with my
concept about the ankle bracelets,

244
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:43,346
one does not have to be a
foreigner to be disloyal.

245
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:44,912
Disloyal?

246
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,425
What do you consider disloyal?

247
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:50,223
Speaking negatively
about our government,

248
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:51,923
criticizing our leaders.

249
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,829
Well, that's dissent.

250
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,766
There is a difference between...

251
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:00,529
disloyalty and dissent.

252
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,273
I'm sure in your
mind that's true.

253
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:08,072
- You claim to be a student.
- I am a student.

254
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:11,211
You seem a little old.

255
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:14,515
Were you left behind as a child?

256
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:18,617
No. I'm doing graduate work.
I'm officially registered.

257
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:21,990
You have the papers,
proper documents?

258
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:23,585
They're...

259
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:26,996
They're back at my apartment.
I could go get them.

260
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,532
You could send someone
to go get them.

261
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:33,699
Uh... What do you study?
What's your major?

262
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:35,229
Political science.

263
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:37,333
Oh, ho, ho, ho.

264
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,577
That's funny?

265
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:45,207
In my experience,
politics is no science.

266
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,946
It isn't exact enough.

267
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:51,149
But I don't mean
to editorialize.

268
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,555
Are you a good student?

269
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,388
Are you a good student?

270
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:57,951
Yes.

271
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:01,028
A "B" in Marxism.

272
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:06,129
Well, if you have the information in
the file, why do you keep asking me?

273
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,636
Fair enough.

274
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:16,844
I see that you've studied the teachings
of Mohammed, Buddha and Jesus...

275
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,444
Adam Smith, Chairman Mao.

276
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:24,854
But what the file
doesn't tell me is...

277
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:28,619
what you believe in,

278
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,220
what ideology,
theology, you follow.

279
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:36,864
Do you believe that your religion
is the only true religion?

280
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,393
That God is on your side?

281
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:42,265
That all other faiths are false?

282
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:46,266
That those who follow errant faiths
are doomed to eternal damnation?

283
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:50,640
That the rest of us should either
be converted or destroyed?

284
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:52,445
There are...

285
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:54,213
extremists...

286
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:57,382
- fanatics, who...
- But not you?

287
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:01,950
- No.
- So, then, I repeat my question.

288
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:06,157
What do you believe in?

289
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:10,131
If not the absolute power
of an absolute god,

290
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:11,260
what?

291
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:13,669
The individual?

292
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:16,401
The ability of the human mind,

293
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,375
the ability of the mind to...

294
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,934
to make a choice?

295
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:23,641
The ability of the
mind to make a choice?

296
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:25,411
Democracy?

297
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,350
Pure democracy, yes.

298
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:37,118
But they certainly don't have pure
democracy in your country, do they?

299
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:43,467
May I have a glass of water?

300
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:44,526
Of course.

301
00:21:46,171 --> 00:21:48,366
Democracy...

302
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:50,932
mean different things

303
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,069
to different people,

304
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:57,037
as does freedom, peace,

305
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:58,379
tolerance...

306
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,217
justice.

307
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:06,017
And if you look at history,
any country's history,

308
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:08,891
in order to achieve
these ideals,

309
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:13,023
there must first be revolution,

310
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:14,054
uprising...

311
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:15,760
Lenin.

312
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:20,035
Ben-Gurion. Mandela.

313
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:21,471
George Washington.

314
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:26,505
He crossed the
Delaware at midnight.

315
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,713
A sneak attack on Christmas Eve.

316
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:35,979
By today's standard,

317
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:39,354
I guess he'd be
considered a terrorist.

318
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:44,622
So you can see why I
understand your actions.

319
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:47,928
Which actions? What
exactly am I accused of?

320
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,668
- Can you identify this man?
- No!

321
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:52,192
No.

322
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:54,068
May I call my family?

323
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:57,234
I'm supposed to phone my mother about now.
She'll worry.

324
00:22:57,275 --> 00:22:59,402
Your mother knows
exactly where you are.

325
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:03,608
- She does?
- Or will shortly.

326
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:06,242
We live in a new
age, if you will,

327
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:10,243
where law enforcement agencies all over the
planet are coordinating their efforts,

328
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:11,687
exchanging information.

329
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:14,283
- About me? I'm nobody.
- You're wrong.

330
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:26,301
- All we've got is 24 hours.
- Yeah, yeah.

331
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,533
I understand.

332
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,069
Hello?

333
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:37,971
Hello.

334
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:52,388
- Is this your handwriting?
- You broke into my room,

335
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,626
rifled through my belongings,

336
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:56,099
and stole my papers?

337
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:57,396
We had a warrant.

338
00:23:57,436 --> 00:24:00,269
Granted by some very
patriotic judge, I'm sure.

339
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:02,330
Is this your handwriting?

340
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,572
- Yes.
- So you wrote this?

341
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,941
Yes.

342
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:11,448
"The tree of liberty must be
refreshed from time to time"

343
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:13,644
"with the blood of
patriots and tyrants."

344
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:16,950
That's a quote from Thomas Jefferson.
It's for my thesis.

345
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:20,424
You say it's a thesis, I say
this document advocates treason.

346
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,620
It's only words on
a piece of paper.

347
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:25,425
You know that words are
as dangerous as any bomb.

348
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,455
Words in the wrong
hands can be misused.

349
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:30,434
What's the saying? "Even the
devil can quote the Bible."

350
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:34,565
All I was trying to say is
that every single one of us

351
00:24:34,606 --> 00:24:37,131
has a mandate to
do what's right.

352
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:39,609
Ah, to do what's right.

353
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:41,475
And what is right?

354
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:44,744
Each person must decide
that for him or herself.

355
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:46,683
Is that treason?

356
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:47,707
Perhaps.

357
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:50,778
All I was trying to say is

358
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:53,154
that every single one of us

359
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:55,421
has a mandate to
do what is right.

360
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,018
Ah.

361
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:59,155
To do what's right?
And what is right?

362
00:24:59,197 --> 00:25:02,928
Well, each person must decide
that for him or herself.

363
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:04,094
Is that treason?

364
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:05,534
Perhaps.

365
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:07,470
From October 7th...

366
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:11,275
to November 10th,

367
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:15,439
you exchanged 16 phone calls
with someone we'll call x.

368
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,141
You tapped my phone?

369
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:21,619
X has made numerous inflammatory
anti-government statements,

370
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:25,350
including a threat to blow up
several buildings in this area,

371
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,290
the bridges, the reservoir.

372
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:30,624
People in anger say
stupid things,

373
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:34,996
people who think that their conversations
are private, who are talking to friends.

374
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:37,524
- So x is your friend?
- I don't know.

375
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:39,901
We may be talking about
two different x.

376
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:43,965
- On November 10th you attended a meeting.
- I went to a dinner at the center.

377
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:45,033
You talked about?

378
00:25:45,076 --> 00:25:47,271
- Politics.
- People expressed opinions.

379
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:50,338
That's usually what happens when
people talk politics, you know.

380
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:54,580
But I have to tell you, I think it's
funny that you suspect our little group

381
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:56,917
of some deep, dark conspiracy.

382
00:25:57,656 --> 00:26:01,524
We get together after class
and fool around and drink.

383
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:05,155
Mostly we drink. And you guys
have been monitoring us?

384
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:08,688
We don't need a reason to
monitor a group or club.

385
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:11,463
We don't need to suspect anyone
of anything to follow them.

386
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:16,600
What else have you done? Got
in our bank records, emails?

387
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:18,233
Long-distance bills?

388
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:19,368
Yes.

389
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:26,606
Well, you must feel really disappointed,
going to all that effort monitoring us.

390
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:30,587
On the contrary, our work bore
fruit, we have a witness...

391
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:35,116
...who says that you were criticizing
certain policies, advocating violence.

392
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,628
Show me this witness!

393
00:26:37,662 --> 00:26:40,995
Let him step forward and
accuse me face to face.

394
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:42,090
The witness is a she.

395
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:44,932
The witness is a she.

396
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,929
And... we don't handle
things that way.

397
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:51,135
If you won't let me
talk to a lawyer,

398
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:54,942
if you won't let
me confront this

399
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,744
so-called witness...

400
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,982
how can I defend myself?

401
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:03,954
Simple. By speaking the truth.

402
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:05,820
I have told the truth.

403
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,020
No! You haven't!

404
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:09,287
You're lying!

405
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:10,919
I'm not!

406
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,691
You're a liar.

407
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:35,219
You really believe this girl
is part of a terrorist cell?

408
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:41,021
We believe that she has associated with certain
individuals who are potential terrorists.

409
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:44,153
Whether she herself is a
terrorist, who knows?

410
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:47,892
Look, I'm getting a lot of heat
from the ambassador, from home,

411
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:49,900
I've got to tell them something.

412
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:51,731
When can I say
she'll be released?

413
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:54,534
Depending on how
cooperative she is,

414
00:27:54,572 --> 00:27:58,975
we'll either start deportation proceedings
by the end of the week or put her to trial.

415
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:02,369
Assure me that she'll
have access to a lawyer.

416
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:06,748
No problem. We've found lawyer/client
meetings to be very informative.

417
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:11,779
That is unless it's decided she goes
before a tribunal, then all bets are off.

418
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:13,586
No lawyer, no jury.

419
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:24,101
- Lieutenant. You know Mr. Hudson.
- Yes.

420
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:29,334
He wants an estimate as to when you
will have finished with Sykes.

421
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,774
- By noon.
- Are you causing her any physical harm?

422
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:36,380
You Americans want our
government to help you,

423
00:28:36,414 --> 00:28:39,542
feed you information, but you
get nervous with our methods.

424
00:28:40,518 --> 00:28:41,883
Do I look nervous?

425
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:46,817
I just don't want to be
surprised by any bruises.

426
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:48,849
- Don't worry.
- Did you bring the file?

427
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:57,426
This is everything we could
get on such short notice.

428
00:28:58,603 --> 00:28:59,865
Thank you.

429
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:02,670
Back to work.

430
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,042
You are welcome to wait.

431
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,771
For what?

432
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:08,745
I don't even know she's here.

433
00:29:11,382 --> 00:29:14,374
You really believe this boy
is part of a terrorist cell?

434
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:17,047
There's been an increase in
chatter the past few weeks.

435
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:20,023
Our intelligence tells us
something is about to happen.

436
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:22,720
We believe Sharif can lead
us to the perpetrators.

437
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,286
Whether he himself is a
terrorist, who knows?

438
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:29,024
Look, I'm getting a lot of heat
from the ambassador, from home,

439
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:32,332
I have to tell them something.
When can I say he'll be released?

440
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:34,304
Depending on how
cooperative he is,

441
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:38,139
we'll start deportation by the end
of the week or put him on trial.

442
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,406
Assure me he'll have
access to a lawyer.

443
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:44,279
No problem. We find the lawyer/client
meetings to be very informative.

444
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:48,376
That is unless it's decided he'll go
before a tribunal, then all bets are off.

445
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:50,284
No lawyer, no jury.

446
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:54,054
- May I see him?
- That isn't advisable at this time.

447
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:55,821
Did you bring the file?

448
00:29:57,028 --> 00:29:59,826
This is everything we could get

449
00:29:59,864 --> 00:30:01,957
on such short notice.

450
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,297
Ah, thank you.

451
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:05,694
Oh.

452
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:06,965
Back to work.

453
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:08,267
You're welcome to wait.

454
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,398
For what?

455
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,705
I don't even know
that he's here.

456
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:29,115
- Take off your clothes.
- What?

457
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,027
- Your clothes. Take them off.
- Why?

458
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,822
Because I'm going to
do a strip search.

459
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:37,801
- Strip...
- Full cavity.

460
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,167
But why?

461
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:42,035
Because it's what we do.

462
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:44,668
It's part of the procedure.

463
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:47,803
I thought searches
were done by people...

464
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,211
of the same sex.

465
00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:54,947
Well, usually they are, but there are
occasional exceptions like this.

466
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:56,851
Take off your clothes.

467
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:06,957
Take off your clothes.

468
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:10,661
- What?
- Your clothes. Take them off.

469
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:12,827
Why?

470
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:16,240
Because I'm going to
do a strip search.

471
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:18,105
- A strip...
- Full cavity.

472
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:20,771
But why?

473
00:31:22,747 --> 00:31:26,615
Because that's what we do.
It's part of the procedure.

474
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,584
I thought...

475
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:32,454
searches were done by
people of the same sex.

476
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:37,322
Usually that's true, but there are
occasional exceptions like this.

477
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,487
Take off your clothes.

478
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:41,964
What if I say no?

479
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:44,602
- Say no?
- Well, I don't want to.

480
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:46,627
Look at the situation
from my side.

481
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:49,640
I can't take the chance of
releasing the wrong person.

482
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:52,234
I cannot give you the
benefit of the doubt.

483
00:31:52,277 --> 00:31:54,108
I can't give you the
benefit of the doubt.

484
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:56,841
I demand to see somebody
from my embassy.

485
00:31:56,881 --> 00:31:59,076
Why? Why not cooperate?

486
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:01,142
- Have you got something to hide?
- No.

487
00:32:01,185 --> 00:32:06,487
Is it your body that you're embarrassed
about, something smaller than it ought to be?

488
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:13,995
There we go. Thank you
for the cooperation.

489
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:15,932
Do you have something to hide?

490
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:16,956
No.

491
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:21,495
Is there a part of your body you're
embarrassed about, something...

492
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:23,006
smaller than it ought to be?

493
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:31,045
There we go.

494
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:34,645
Thank you for your cooperation.

495
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,861
Uh, uh.

496
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:53,033
Hm.

497
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:54,504
You work out.

498
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:58,105
You have a good solid body.

499
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:02,710
So I figure maybe
you go to the gym.

500
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:12,546
Pants.

501
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:24,798
Sexy.

502
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,303
Take them off.

503
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:36,509
Yes. A good solid body.

504
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:40,250
And by solid I don't mean fat.

505
00:33:40,284 --> 00:33:42,343
You are not fat.

506
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:47,586
We can all afford to lose
a few pounds, of course.

507
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:50,389
But you're not
even close to fat.

508
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:19,884
Sexy.

509
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:22,322
Take them off.

510
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:39,473
Yes. You've got a
good solid body.

511
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,641
By solid I do not mean fat.

512
00:34:44,048 --> 00:34:45,913
You are not fat.

513
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:51,479
We can all afford to lose a few pounds, of
course, but you're not even close to fat.

514
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:57,726
Did you know that the al-Qaeda
in their training manual

515
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:03,496
suggest that martyrs for Allah shave off
all of their body hair before they die?

516
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:06,367
Why?

517
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:09,866
For what purpose?

518
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:13,610
I ask you, why?

519
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,942
I don't know anything
about al-Qaeda.

520
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:21,952
I'm not saying that you do.

521
00:35:25,556 --> 00:35:27,421
- Open your mouth.
- My mouth?

522
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:29,348
Wide.

523
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:30,951
Aah.

524
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:32,394
Like at the dentist.

525
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:36,298
I mean, you do go to the
dentist, don't you?

526
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,367
Wider.

527
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,994
Come on, help me out.

528
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:43,199
My mouth doesn't go any wider.

529
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:46,210
Open like during oral sex.

530
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:55,010
You know they call
this a cavity search,

531
00:35:55,052 --> 00:35:57,987
cavity meaning every
orifice in the body.

532
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:05,151
But you'd be surprised the number of times I
actually find a cavity in someone's teeth.

533
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:07,425
But not you.

534
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:11,529
Yours are in tiptop condition.

535
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:15,671
There. That wasn't
so bad, was it?

536
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:21,836
Ever been married?

537
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:24,245
No.

538
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:29,780
You...

539
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:32,220
like girls,

540
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:34,848
don't you?

541
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:38,689
Yes.

542
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:42,359
So if I touch you down there...

543
00:36:45,636 --> 00:36:48,002
what do you think your
reaction will be?

544
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:49,697
Don't.

545
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,968
Don't?

546
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,039
Please.

547
00:36:58,182 --> 00:36:59,342
Don't.

548
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:02,375
Ever been married?

549
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:05,016
No.

550
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,956
You like girls, don't you?

551
00:37:08,192 --> 00:37:10,217
Yes.

552
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:13,890
So if I touch you down there, what
do you think your reaction will be?

553
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:15,023
Don't.

554
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,158
Oh.

555
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,191
Don't. Did you say don't?

556
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:22,862
Please don't.

557
00:37:25,142 --> 00:37:26,473
Ah.

558
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:30,276
That was sweet. Er...

559
00:37:30,314 --> 00:37:32,305
What's the word?

560
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:33,476
Plaintive.

561
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:37,788
That's what happens to
people who end up in here.

562
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:41,781
Outside these walls they're
tough, they've got an attitude.

563
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:45,652
But once that door
shuts, they crumble.

564
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:47,254
They turn into little girls.

565
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:51,495
That's what you
remind me of now.

566
00:37:53,137 --> 00:37:55,662
A frightened little girl.

567
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:57,965
Stop.

568
00:37:58,009 --> 00:38:00,102
That a sensitive area for you?

569
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:03,746
I don't like being touched.

570
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:06,045
- Being touched there or anywhere?
- Stop!

571
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:07,846
Careful! You don't
want to hit me!

572
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:10,611
That's what you remind
me of right now,

573
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:12,680
a frightened little girl.

574
00:38:12,723 --> 00:38:14,122
Stop.

575
00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:17,093
- I don't... Stop!
- Is that a sensitive area for you?

576
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:21,224
- I don't like people touching me.
- Touching you there or anywhere?

577
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:22,562
Stop!

578
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:27,060
Careful. You don't want to hit me.
The consequences would be dire.

579
00:38:27,104 --> 00:38:28,765
Aargh! Aargh!

580
00:38:34,178 --> 00:38:35,202
Oh.

581
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,311
Tell me about your girlfriend.

582
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:42,482
I didn't say I had a girlfriend.

583
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:46,155
There are references
to her in your emails.

584
00:38:50,394 --> 00:38:52,954
Is there any part of my life
you haven't picked through?

585
00:38:54,398 --> 00:38:56,992
Was she the great
love of your life?

586
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:05,965
Why did she leave?

587
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:11,239
There is nothing in my
emails about her leaving.

588
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:15,216
How do you know she left?

589
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:21,889
I can see the pain in your eyes.

590
00:39:27,431 --> 00:39:29,023
Why did she walk out on you?

591
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:32,001
I don't know. Why does
anybody walk out?

592
00:39:47,251 --> 00:39:48,912
Look familiar?

593
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:56,586
That's her.

594
00:39:57,628 --> 00:39:58,788
Yes.

595
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:01,021
Gorgeous.

596
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:06,060
By the way,

597
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:08,361
she's our witness.

598
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,806
She's going to
testify against you.

599
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:13,937
No.

600
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:16,545
She wouldn't.

601
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:25,313
She wouldn't do that.

602
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:08,357
Settle down.

603
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:21,367
So why did she walk out on you?

604
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:27,115
I don't know.

605
00:41:28,385 --> 00:41:30,353
Why does anybody walk out?

606
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:37,118
Look familiar?

607
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:42,529
- That's her.
- Yes.

608
00:41:42,566 --> 00:41:43,965
Gorgeous.

609
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:47,264
By the way,

610
00:41:47,304 --> 00:41:49,238
she's our witness.

611
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:51,332
She's gonna testify against you.

612
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:52,467
No!

613
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,000
She wouldn't.

614
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:58,206
- She wouldn't do that!
- Settle down.

615
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:08,515
We found these photos

616
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:10,322
in your apartment.

617
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,090
Airports, bridges.

618
00:42:13,097 --> 00:42:14,530
A tunnel.

619
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:15,691
Dam.

620
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,667
I'm a tourist. I
photograph things.

621
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:22,501
If you looked, you also saw...

622
00:42:23,974 --> 00:42:27,034
mountains, sunsets,
children playing.

623
00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:30,938
A week ago, you rented a car.

624
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:34,940
Ah, no, I just signed
the forms for a friend.

625
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:40,448
We found trace elements of TNT
in the trunk of that car.

626
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:42,755
- What?
- Granted they're only molecules,

627
00:42:42,793 --> 00:42:46,854
but why was there TNT in the
trunk of the car you rented?

628
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:50,264
I told you, I didn't
rent the car for myself.

629
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:52,895
A friend asked me as a favor.

630
00:42:52,937 --> 00:42:54,427
Which friend? What's the name?

631
00:42:55,172 --> 00:42:59,973
I'm not gonna tell you. I'm not
guilty of anything and neither is he.

632
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:02,535
You harbored a terrorist.

633
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,207
- No.
- You financed a terrorist.

634
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:08,116
- No!
- You aided and abetted a terrorist.

635
00:43:08,152 --> 00:43:08,618
No!

636
00:43:09,486 --> 00:43:13,217
Would you still say that if you
were attached to a lie detector?

637
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:16,317
- Yes.
- And you'd answer every question?

638
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,385
- Yes.
- What if I gave you truth serum?

639
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,989
- Truth serum?
- Inject you with truth serum.

640
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,800
OK. Go ahead.

641
00:43:24,835 --> 00:43:27,963
We believe your friend x is
involved in terrorist activities.

642
00:43:28,005 --> 00:43:30,166
- You're wrong.
- Why would you protect him?

643
00:43:30,207 --> 00:43:34,405
Why would a decent person protect someone
who's planning the deaths of innocent people?

644
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:37,175
- He's not...
- I'm what you might call old school.

645
00:43:37,214 --> 00:43:41,844
To stop crime, you threaten criminals with
physical punishment, imprisonment, death.

646
00:43:41,885 --> 00:43:47,517
But these suicide bombers, they've already chosen
to die, they're not afraid of prosecution.

647
00:43:47,558 --> 00:43:50,994
So we have to stop them before they
act, we have to keep them alive.

648
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:53,360
That's their punishment.

649
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:56,161
Make the bastards
wish they were dead.

650
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,464
Humiliate them.

651
00:43:58,502 --> 00:44:01,994
Or make them aware that
if they die in here,

652
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:03,472
alone,

653
00:44:03,507 --> 00:44:07,238
that their deaths
will have no meaning,

654
00:44:07,277 --> 00:44:09,142
no resonance,

655
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:13,081
no effect on anyone whatsoever.

656
00:44:23,894 --> 00:44:25,953
Turn around.

657
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:27,827
Put your hands on the wall.

658
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:31,164
Palms flat.

659
00:44:37,875 --> 00:44:39,308
Spread your legs.

660
00:44:42,946 --> 00:44:44,038
Turn around.

661
00:44:45,949 --> 00:44:48,349
Put your hands against the wall.

662
00:44:48,385 --> 00:44:49,750
Palms flat.

663
00:44:49,787 --> 00:44:51,254
Spread your legs.

664
00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:22,114
I have to tell you this is
my least favorite part.

665
00:45:24,988 --> 00:45:28,822
I took the test, went through
the academy, for what?

666
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:31,851
Thought I'd be out in the field,
doing good, saving lives.

667
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:36,093
Instead I spend my days with my
hand up other people's asses.

668
00:45:36,133 --> 00:45:38,931
Might as well have gone
to medical school.

669
00:45:40,137 --> 00:45:42,196
Become a gynecologist.

670
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:44,867
Or a... What's the word
for a colon specialist?

671
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:47,103
Stop talking and just do it.

672
00:45:47,144 --> 00:45:48,805
What? I didn't hear you.

673
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:54,943
You heard me. I know what you're up to.
I'm not an idiot.

674
00:45:54,985 --> 00:45:57,112
So do whatever you want.

675
00:45:57,154 --> 00:46:01,386
I'm gonna stare at this wall,
I'm gonna focus on this wall,

676
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:02,915
memorize this wall.

677
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,554
I will own this wall.

678
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,791
What you should
be focusing on...

679
00:46:11,902 --> 00:46:13,597
...is the children.

680
00:46:15,873 --> 00:46:17,272
Orphaned children.

681
00:46:18,342 --> 00:46:20,333
Traumatized children.

682
00:46:22,146 --> 00:46:24,876
You see, unlike you, I
have a child, a boy.

683
00:46:26,183 --> 00:46:29,243
I want him to live in
a world that's safe.

684
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:32,187
Where he feels safe.

685
00:46:34,691 --> 00:46:36,818
I want him...

686
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:38,657
to live...

687
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:43,193
in a world that's safe,

688
00:46:43,233 --> 00:46:44,723
where he feels safe.

689
00:46:49,439 --> 00:46:53,876
Doing this, what kind
of role model are you,

690
00:46:53,911 --> 00:46:57,278
what kind of legacy are
you handing down to him?

691
00:46:57,314 --> 00:46:58,872
Safe...

692
00:46:58,916 --> 00:47:01,180
but not free.

693
00:47:01,218 --> 00:47:03,550
Alive but not human.

694
00:47:13,564 --> 00:47:17,796
It is not my fault that we
don't live in a perfect world.

695
00:47:19,136 --> 00:47:22,799
It's not my fault that we don't
live in a perfect world.

696
00:47:54,438 --> 00:47:57,066
I'm going to do this
every day, all day...

697
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:02,678
until it becomes as
natural as breathing,

698
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:05,238
you will come to
need it like air.

699
00:48:07,284 --> 00:48:11,084
And the best part is I
didn't have to touch you.

700
00:48:24,534 --> 00:48:26,729
So let me ask you again...

701
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:30,402
do you know these men?

702
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:37,308
Do you?

703
00:48:37,347 --> 00:48:39,008
Do you?

704
00:48:51,028 --> 00:48:52,461
OK.

705
00:48:52,496 --> 00:48:54,657
That's it.

706
00:48:54,698 --> 00:48:56,689
Someone else will be
in to talk to you.

707
00:50:07,571 --> 00:50:10,335
We're going to do
this every day,

708
00:50:10,374 --> 00:50:12,308
all day...

709
00:50:13,477 --> 00:50:16,742
until it becomes as
natural as breathing.

710
00:50:18,749 --> 00:50:19,909
Yes.

711
00:50:20,917 --> 00:50:24,250
You will come to need it...

712
00:50:24,287 --> 00:50:26,084
like air.

713
00:50:28,258 --> 00:50:29,816
The best part is...

714
00:50:31,094 --> 00:50:33,858
I didn't have to touch you.

715
00:50:39,903 --> 00:50:42,667
So... let me ask you again...

716
00:50:43,473 --> 00:50:44,940
do you know these men?

717
00:50:46,943 --> 00:50:48,001
Do you?

718
00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:07,490
Yeah.

719
00:51:07,531 --> 00:51:08,520
OK.

720
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:14,432
That's it.

721
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:22,545
Someone else will be
in to talk to you.

722
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:54,099
Ah.

723
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:12,947
Say, theoretically, that the
government of the United States

724
00:53:12,989 --> 00:53:16,584
could rid the world of
terrorism forever...

725
00:53:20,063 --> 00:53:24,523
but only if for a single day you gave up
all your rights as an American citizen.

726
00:53:25,969 --> 00:53:27,095
Would you do it?

727
00:53:31,808 --> 00:53:34,174
Would you give up your
rights for a week?

728
00:53:40,684 --> 00:53:42,276
A month?

729
00:53:49,526 --> 00:53:50,891
A year?

730
00:53:52,996 --> 00:53:54,327
Ten years?

731
00:53:56,132 --> 00:53:57,463
Forever?
