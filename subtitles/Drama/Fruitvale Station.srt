1
00:00:15,493 --> 00:00:16,779
What's your resolution?

2
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:17,979
I'm gonna cut carbs.

3
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,636
But, you're Mexican. You can't
eat nothing yo grandma makes.

4
00:00:21,637 --> 00:00:23,697
It only takes 30 days
to form a habit.

5
00:00:23,698 --> 00:00:25,884
And then, it becomes
second nature.

6
00:00:25,885 --> 00:00:28,727
- Who said that?
- Oprah.

7
00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:32,626
Okay, you and Oprah cool now?

8
00:00:32,893 --> 00:00:36,149
- What's yours?
- I'm gonna quit selling trees.

9
00:02:15,679 --> 00:02:17,061
Hold on, hold up.

10
00:02:17,062 --> 00:02:21,140
What's up? I been
home hella long...

11
00:02:23,421 --> 00:02:25,078
I don't know...

12
00:02:26,632 --> 00:02:28,376
Every time you touch me,

13
00:02:28,377 --> 00:02:31,794
all I can think about is how
you was touching that Bitch.

14
00:02:31,795 --> 00:02:34,592
I'll never hear
end of that shit.

15
00:02:43,197 --> 00:02:44,687
You know what?

16
00:02:46,401 --> 00:02:47,881
You right,

17
00:02:47,882 --> 00:02:49,082
go.

18
00:02:51,841 --> 00:02:53,488
What did do?

19
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:58,246
I fucked up that one time.

20
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:04,660
No, you got caught, one time.

21
00:03:04,661 --> 00:03:08,017
And you gonna sit here
and tell me, that was

22
00:03:08,018 --> 00:03:11,571
the first time you kicked
it with that Bitch.

23
00:03:11,572 --> 00:03:15,721
You ain't never seen
her before that.

24
00:03:19,147 --> 00:03:21,355
That shit is over.

25
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:27,398
All I want is you... and T,

26
00:03:29,366 --> 00:03:31,445
forever.

27
00:03:36,204 --> 00:03:38,405
What you mean, forever?

28
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:46,222
Let me show you.

29
00:03:55,122 --> 00:03:56,938
Daddy.

30
00:04:00,184 --> 00:04:01,598
What?

31
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,799
She's asking for you.

32
00:04:13,674 --> 00:04:15,066
What's up?

33
00:04:15,067 --> 00:04:16,266
I can't sleep...

34
00:04:16,267 --> 00:04:19,055
<i>Can't sleep.</i>

35
00:04:22,302 --> 00:04:25,800
You want to sleep in here
with Mummy and Daddy?

36
00:04:26,755 --> 00:04:28,809
T..You know better than that.

37
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,583
What time is it?

38
00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:36,903
Damn, it's after midnight.

39
00:05:46,954 --> 00:05:48,834
Mummy, can I have two of
the fruit snacks today?

40
00:05:48,835 --> 00:05:50,652
No, You can take an extra
apple, if you want.

41
00:05:50,653 --> 00:05:54,415
But mummy I-
Don't argue T. It's too early.

42
00:06:10,655 --> 00:06:14,922
- We gotta stop and get gas.
- We got enough to get us there.

43
00:06:37,842 --> 00:06:41,321
- Good morning, Tatiana!

44
00:06:41,322 --> 00:06:44,097

00:06:55,786 --> 00:06:57,787
You gonna go home and sleep, right?
Naw...

47
00:06:59,603 --> 00:07:01,084

48
00:07:01,489 --> 00:07:02,569
Get some stuff for tonight.

49
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:05,850
I'd rather die than
come here on my day off.

50
00:07:08,026 --> 00:07:11,746
We gonna go to Frisco, right?
To see the fireworks?

51
00:07:15,183 --> 00:07:16,773
Yeah.

52

00:08:45,629 --> 00:08:48,689
As tempting as that sounds... this place
would be a mess without me today.

60
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:52,425
Okay... You still want me to

81
00:10:44,618 --> 00:10:47,578
Tell her, I said, Happy Birthday.
Why don't you come and tell her yourself.

82
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:50,605
I can't be doing it tonight. You
know I've gotta bust some moves...

83
00:10:50,606 --> 00:10:52,229
You ain't bustin' shit bruh.

84
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:55,751
It's good for the
countdown though.

85
00:10:56,328 --> 00:10:58,008
Frisco. Fireworks
and the whole shit.

86
00:11:04,003 --> 00:11:05,458

88
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,950
Can you show me what

89
00:11:16,841 --> 00:11:18,345
Sole?

90
00:11:18,346 --> 00:11:21,468
Okay,

91
00:11:21,469 --> 00:11:23,750
What about your catfish?
Can I see that?

92
00:11:23,751 --> 00:11:30,368
Okay..I wanna do like... fish
fry; Are these ones good for fry?

93
00:11:30,626 --> 00:11:33,760
It's fish. You can

94
00:11:33,761 --> 00:11:34,960
Right.

95
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:37,125

Fat ones too...

100
00:11:48,327 --> 00:11:50,820
So, you're having a fish fry
for New Years or something?

101
00:11:50,821 --> 00:11:53,401
Yeah. Something like that.

102
00:11:53,917 --> 00:11:57,142
I work here. I can help
you figure it out.

103
00:11:58,854 --> 00:12:00,811
It's my day off.

104
00:12:06,782 --> 00:12:10,239
Well, I'm cooking for a friend, tonight.
Before we go into the city..and..

105
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,836
He loves fried fish.
Like, Southern style...

106
00:12:12,837 --> 00:12:15,631
Southern? He sounds
like, he's black?

107
00:12:15,632 --> 00:12:21,230
He's white. But he knows a
lot of black people I guess.

108
00:12:22,431 --> 00:12:26,003
I don't know, what
I've got myself into.

109
00:12:43,892 --> 00:12:45,722
- Hello?
- Grandma...

115
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:00,838

But, I do have a customer here. She wants
to have a fish fry but she don't know how.

117
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:06,759
You think, you can tell her

118
00:13:06,784 --> 00:13:07,750

00:13:18,983 --> 00:13:20,968
Put her on the phone.

124
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,543
- What's her name?
- Grandma Bonnie.

125
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:31,237

00:13:38,034 --> 00:13:39,866
Hey, Good morning, Emi.

00:13:41,104 --> 00:13:42,703
Oscar, what's going on?

129
00:13:42,704 --> 00:13:44,724
Grab some stuff for
my mum's birthday.

130
00:13:44,725 --> 00:13:46,365
I hope you found
everything that you need.

131
00:13:46,463 --> 00:13:48,303
Yeah, I just wanna
talk to you for a sec.

132
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,095
It's a little nuts right
now, holiday and all.

133
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:52,576
Look, I wanna talk 'bout my job.

134
00:13:53,437 --> 00:13:55,784
- The Position's been filled.
- Look, look Emi..

135
00:13:57,169 --> 00:14:00,573
Look, I really need this job.
Alright.

136
00:14:00,579 --> 00:14:03,739
Look, I was going through some shit, trying
to get back on my feet. You feel me?

137
00:14:03,764 --> 00:14:04,964
But, I need this.

138
00:14:05,539 --> 00:14:09,029
You can start me back off with one shift
a week or whatever. I'll be here.

139
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:11,438
You can work me 40 hours a
week and pay me for 20.

140
00:14:11,439 --> 00:14:14,526
Dude. I hired somebody else.

141
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:18,250
For me to bring you back, that means
I have to let someone else go.

142
00:14:18,429 --> 00:14:21,440
Someone... Who's never
showed up late, once.

143
00:14:21,673 --> 00:14:22,940
I'm sorry,

144
00:14:22,941 --> 00:14:25,883
I like you man, but
I can't do that.

145
00:14:27,716 --> 00:14:30,215
You want me selling dope, bruh?
Oscar,

146
00:14:30,216 --> 00:14:33,071
You need me outside,
to get it done, bruh?

147
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:35,415
Take care of yourself.

148
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:40,703
Hey!

149
00:14:44,305 --> 00:14:45,864
I'm an expert now.

150
00:14:45,865 --> 00:14:47,624
Sure you got
everything you need?

151
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:50,054
I've got everything, thank you.

152
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,254
No problem.

153
00:14:51,255 --> 00:14:54,811
Here you go.

154
00:14:54,812 --> 00:14:56,011
I am Katie, by the way.

155
00:14:56,012 --> 00:14:57,212

Happy new year.

157
00:14:58,491 --> 00:14:59,584
Happy new year.

158
00:14:59,585 --> 00:15:00,814
What's up bruh?

159
00:15:01,132 --> 00:15:02,812
- Emi was good.
- Putting you back on?

160
00:15:03,256 --> 00:15:04,322
Starting next week.

161
00:15:06,289 --> 00:15:08,929
Take it easy man. We'll celebrate tonight.
Can you not be late?

162
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:11,090
Don't worry about that, man.
Keep your nasty phone.

163
00:15:11,104 --> 00:15:12,950
- Be safe, bruh.
- Yup.

164
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,274
- Hello?
- Hey, chump! What's up?

165
00:16:00,275 --> 00:16:02,942
- What you doing?
- Just got back from the job.

166
00:16:02,943 --> 00:16:04,142
I thought you were off today.

167
00:16:04,143 --> 00:16:05,343
I am.

168
00:16:07,062 --> 00:16:09,325
- You call Mum yet?
- Yeah, did you?

169
00:16:09,326 --> 00:16:10,526
Yeah.

170
00:16:11,796 --> 00:16:14,087
I got good news and bad news.

171
00:16:14,152 --> 00:16:15,787
Give me the bad news first.

172
00:16:16,945 --> 00:16:19,550
I'm gonna need help with
the rent for this month.

173
00:16:19,551 --> 00:16:20,750
How much?

174
00:16:20,751 --> 00:16:24,814
Like $300. But, I can get you
back in a couple of weeks.

175
00:16:24,815 --> 00:16:26,255
Okay. So, What's the good news.

176
00:16:27,762 --> 00:16:29,312
I'm doing overtime tonight.

177
00:16:29,313 --> 00:16:30,512
Come on Chantay.

178
00:16:30,513 --> 00:16:31,712
I gotta do it.

179
00:16:31,713 --> 00:16:32,913
Plus, Mums understands.

180
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,266
But I need you to get her a card
for me and sign it alright.

181
00:16:36,267 --> 00:16:37,466
All right.

182
00:16:37,467 --> 00:16:41,144
And Osc, don't get me a fake ass
card with white people on it.

183
00:16:41,145 --> 00:16:42,345
I want a black card.

184
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,729
All right. I got you.

185
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:44,929
All right.

186
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:45,930
I love you, alright.

187
00:16:45,931 --> 00:16:47,439
Love you too, scrub.

188
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,640
Whatever, bye.

189
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:06,189
What's up wit it, Osc?

190
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:09,259
What's up bruh? My bad
about last night.

191
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,852
You still trying to get that?

192
00:17:10,853 --> 00:17:13,726
Yeah, but I ain't out that way though.
I'ma be in the Town all day.

193
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,403
It's cool, I'm
coming to you, bruh.

194
00:17:17,404 --> 00:17:19,124
All right.. Meet me over
there by the water.

195
00:17:19,149 --> 00:17:21,432
Right off of 80. Give
me like an hour.

196
00:17:21,433 --> 00:17:23,970
- All right, bet that.
- Bet.

197
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:47,569
Hey, hey. Slow down.

198
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:50,720
Hey, slow down. You
beched motherfucker.

199
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,280
Somebody help!

200
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:48,228
Alright, give me your hand.

201
00:21:48,229 --> 00:21:49,429
Ear.

202
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,506
Hair..

203
00:21:52,507 --> 00:21:53,706
And your mouth.

204
00:21:53,707 --> 00:21:54,907
Alright, turn around.

205
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:58,821
Bend over... squat.

206
00:22:01,157 --> 00:22:03,438
It's alright, you're good.

207
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,590
Happy Birthday.

208
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,521
What happened to your face?

209
00:22:45,254 --> 00:22:46,887
You look nice today.

210
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:50,346
My girls come over last night?

211
00:22:50,892 --> 00:22:52,506
We played board games.

212
00:22:52,507 --> 00:22:53,706
I bet, Y'all let her win too.

213
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:54,906
Of course.

214
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:58,285
Y'all hella weak for that. She
gets no easy wins around me.

215
00:22:59,957 --> 00:23:01,293
What?

216
00:23:01,294 --> 00:23:03,746
Remember that microwave
popcorn you bought a while back?

217
00:23:03,747 --> 00:23:04,946
Hella good.

218
00:23:04,947 --> 00:23:08,113
Yeah. While I was
putting it into a bowl.

219
00:23:08,114 --> 00:23:11,251
Tatiana's just standing there..
Staring up at me;

220
00:23:11,252 --> 00:23:13,501
Looking like she
wants something.

221
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,033
Okay, what? Come on Mum.

222
00:23:17,034 --> 00:23:18,034
She says..

223
00:23:18,035 --> 00:23:20,979
"Grandma, do we have
any dark butter?"

224
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,700
What's Dark butter?

225
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,410
I'm thinking, maybe she watch
"Food Network" or something.

226
00:23:27,411 --> 00:23:30,262
So I say, "what's dark
butter sweetheart?"

227
00:23:30,263 --> 00:23:36,018
She says, "When Daddy took me to see
WALL.E he asked for light butter",

228
00:23:36,019 --> 00:23:38,808
so I want to try some
dark butter this time."

229
00:23:38,809 --> 00:23:39,705
She too smart.

230
00:23:39,706 --> 00:23:41,030
This mums right here?

231
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,459
She a snitch to?
What the Fuck you say about my Mum bruh?

232
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,460
Fuck you and that bitch.

233
00:23:46,461 --> 00:23:50,707
Yeah, You tough in here with these guards.
I'm gonna see ya bitch ass outside bruh.

234
00:23:56,007 --> 00:23:57,846
Is there a problem here?

235
00:23:57,847 --> 00:23:59,047
Naw, we good.

236
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,820
Yeah, we good for now.

237
00:24:11,421 --> 00:24:12,908
Calm down.

238
00:24:14,976 --> 00:24:17,375
Calm... down!

239
00:24:17,376 --> 00:24:18,576
Oscar...

240
00:24:22,736 --> 00:24:24,832
What happened to your face?

241
00:24:27,395 --> 00:24:29,075
Dark butter.

242
00:24:32,107 --> 00:24:35,756
She always listening? Too
damn smart for her own good.

243
00:24:35,757 --> 00:24:38,805
The preschool said we should think
about starting her in school early.

244
00:24:38,806 --> 00:24:40,006
Phina tell you that?

245
00:24:41,993 --> 00:24:44,025
Yeah, we're gonna put
her in private school.

246
00:24:46,681 --> 00:24:48,441
Uniforms...

247
00:24:48,442 --> 00:24:50,548
I was looking at St. Bede
the other day. It's this

248
00:24:50,549 --> 00:24:52,852
other school that starts
them off learning Spanish,

249
00:24:52,853 --> 00:24:55,956
and they back going on English - -
I'm not coming to see you anymore.

250
00:24:55,957 --> 00:24:57,157
What?

251
00:24:58,847 --> 00:25:03,150
I'm not coming here, to these visits
anymore. This is the last time.

252
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:05,717
I know I know I know. This is my
last time too. I told you that.

253
00:25:05,718 --> 00:25:08,798
I ain't going down no more. You want to
keep putting SOPHINA through this...

254
00:25:08,823 --> 00:25:10,956
you go on right ahead. Okay?

255
00:25:10,957 --> 00:25:12,240
But Tatiana,

256
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:14,430
that baby doesn't
deserve this, Oscar.

257
00:25:14,455 --> 00:25:16,554
She don't know what's going on.

258
00:25:16,555 --> 00:25:18,933
So, I guess that's why she
asked me why you love

259
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:21,510
taking your vacations
more than being with her.

260
00:25:21,511 --> 00:25:22,710
She ain't say that.

261
00:25:22,711 --> 00:25:24,959
So I'm the liar now.

262
00:25:28,993 --> 00:25:30,713
Ma you gotta tell her
that I love her.

263
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:35,357
Tell her, I ain't gonna leave her.
Tell her yourself!

264
00:25:35,358 --> 00:25:37,318
The Next time you call home
you tell her yourself.

265
00:25:37,343 --> 00:25:39,441
Or better yet, let her
come visit you here.

266
00:25:45,883 --> 00:25:48,725
- She don't need to be exposed.
- You've already exposed...!

267
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:52,060
You've already exposed her to this.
So, you gonna leave me?

268
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,709
You gonna leave me again,
What kinda Mum is you?

269
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:56,630
You wanna fuck around
and leave me in here?

270
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,100
You ain't never have my
fuckin' back anyway.

271
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:06,050
I'm being here by myself.

272
00:26:10,638 --> 00:26:13,813
I love you Oscar.. I do.

273
00:26:13,814 --> 00:26:16,246
And, I'm praying for you.

274
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,450
I'll see you when you get home.

275
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,020
Ma, hold up. Let
me get a hug, Ma.

276
00:26:24,695 --> 00:26:26,635
- Grant.
- I can't get a hug?

277
00:26:30,205 --> 00:26:32,985
Ma, let me get a hug..Ma!

278
00:26:32,986 --> 00:26:34,186
Hey Ma, I'm sorry!

279
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,405
Ma, I'm sorry!

280
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,561
Bruh I didn't think we
was ever gonna link up.

281
00:27:38,994 --> 00:27:41,298
- What's good?
- Just new..

282
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:43,389
I got good news and
bad news my nigg.

283
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:46,023
Don't tell me you ain't got it.

284
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,430
- Sold it to a white boy.
- For real..For how much?

285
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,456
- Gave me a rack for it.
- I wasn't gonna pay that high.

286
00:27:53,457 --> 00:27:56,652
But, I still needed that
though... What's the good?

287
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,004
- For you driving out.
- Right on Osc.

288
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,070
- It's good bruh.
- You sure?

289
00:28:09,071 --> 00:28:10,270
Take it.

290
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:11,471
Right on.

291
00:28:25,226 --> 00:28:27,027
Burn one with ya boy
right quick though.

292
00:28:28,611 --> 00:28:30,475
That's all you bruh.

293
00:28:31,998 --> 00:28:33,869
Alright, bruh. Peace...
I'm movin'.

294
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:17,799
What kinda cake is it?

295
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,000
Carrot cake.

296
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:21,080
Why you didn't get ice cream?

297
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:24,920
'Cause it ain't your birthday.

298
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:29,150
You know it would be hella easier if you
just had your stuff at my spot right.

299
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,190
When you gonna move in.

300
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:35,140
Maybe, when you stop having trees
in the car before we pick up T.

301
00:29:45,631 --> 00:29:48,119
Can you roll down
the window, please?

302
00:30:32,228 --> 00:30:34,789
Hey T. T, come here.

303
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,240
- We played "Freeze Tag" today.
- Really?

304
00:30:47,241 --> 00:30:50,339
- Did you win?
- They couldn't catch me.

305
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:51,650
You think you're fast.

306
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,370
Faster than Daddy?

307
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:59,689
Really?

308
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:02,111
What's that?

309
00:31:26,805 --> 00:31:28,809
- What are you doing?
- What you mean?

310
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:04,514
Can watch T tonight?
We gonna go to Frisco.

311
00:32:04,515 --> 00:32:08,584
Ask your sister.
But Rose got hella kids to watch.

312
00:32:08,585 --> 00:32:13,072
But what's the difference between
watching six kids or watching seven kids?

313
00:32:22,926 --> 00:32:25,693
<i>Quieres pasar la noche con sus primos?
Si, Si.</i>

314
00:32:30,564 --> 00:32:33,620
Daddy, what's that
on your shirt?

315
00:32:36,373 --> 00:32:38,548
Daddy had an accident at work.

316
00:32:40,572 --> 00:32:42,418
How's work? By the way.

317
00:32:43,715 --> 00:32:46,475
Work is... work.

318
00:32:55,104 --> 00:32:57,016
I'll be back.

319
00:33:14,802 --> 00:33:15,955
What you think?

320
00:33:18,458 --> 00:33:20,018
It's cool.

321
00:33:21,128 --> 00:33:23,735
There a shirt on the bed
for you, if you want.

322
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:34,949
Are you alright?

323
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:48,575
Osc. What's up?

324
00:33:52,857 --> 00:33:54,458
Fuck it.

325
00:33:55,378 --> 00:33:56,914
I lost my job.

326
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:03,290
For what?

327
00:34:04,547 --> 00:34:06,273
Being late.

328
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,943
Missed a couple days when
I had to get some money.

329
00:34:09,944 --> 00:34:12,738
They told you today?

330
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:13,939
On your day off?

331
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:17,340
Keep it real, they
told me two weeks ago.

332
00:34:20,586 --> 00:34:22,706
My bad Phina.

333
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,099
I though I was gonna
get my job back.

334
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:29,949
- I thought I could talk to Emi...
- You think life a fucking joke...

335
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:34,083
You think you're gonna get fired and then
somebody is gonna give you their job back?

336
00:34:38,665 --> 00:34:39,904
What?

337
00:34:42,542 --> 00:34:44,398
You ain't shit, you know that?

338
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:47,921
You lie to me, you lie to
your fucking daughter.

339
00:34:47,922 --> 00:34:49,483
I didn't have to
tell you nothing!

340
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:53,365
I could have kept gettin' it.
I don't wanna know shit.

341
00:34:53,366 --> 00:34:55,006
So you would have
just kept faking..

342
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:58,197
You been out busting nocks?
And doing whatever

343
00:34:58,198 --> 00:35:01,273
else, or WHOEVER else you
do while I'm at work?

344
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,057
You ain't even listening to me.

345
00:35:05,058 --> 00:35:09,860
Not after you lie for two weeks get
cornered, and don't have a choice.

346
00:35:09,861 --> 00:35:11,142
That's some pussy act shit.

347
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,496
What did you today.

348
00:35:17,635 --> 00:35:20,939
I bet you sold that fucking zip.
I dumped that shit, Phina.

349
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,600
That's what I'm
trying to tell you.

350
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:27,020
I'm tired.

351
00:35:29,183 --> 00:35:33,776
Thought I could start fresh. But
that shit ain't working like that.

352
00:35:45,456 --> 00:35:49,777
You threw a whole zip of weed.
And you don't got a job.

353
00:35:55,372 --> 00:35:57,596
I could slap you right now.

354
00:36:05,188 --> 00:36:06,876
What are you gonna do?

355
00:36:09,771 --> 00:36:11,426
Something legal.

356
00:36:13,929 --> 00:36:16,865
Maybe if I can just not
fuck up, for 30 days..

357
00:36:21,113 --> 00:36:24,609
That's how long Oprah said
to form a habit, right?

358
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:32,314
Look at me.

359
00:36:33,641 --> 00:36:37,434
Don't make me have to do
this shit alone, again.

360
00:37:36,965 --> 00:37:38,813
You guys are just in time.

361
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,490
My God, you guys got a cake too?

362
00:37:43,693 --> 00:37:45,550
Thank you baby.

363
00:38:02,585 --> 00:38:05,585
Baby, You know all I needed was two, you
didn't have to spend so much money.

364
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:07,090
You Ain' gotta worry about that.

365
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:27,885
A Raiders fan, cheering
for the Steelers.

366
00:39:27,886 --> 00:39:30,498

You're insane, you know that?

371
00:41:07,188 --> 00:41:08,909
Thanks for your help tonight.

372
00:41:10,367 --> 00:41:12,678
Come on Ma, You
ain't gotta thank me.

373
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:15,012
You shouldn't even

374
00:41:15,013 --> 00:41:16,213
Relax.

375
00:41:18,807 --> 00:41:20,333

That way you guys can drink and hang out,

00:45:17,455 --> 00:45:18,421
No?

413
00:45:18,422 --> 00:45:20,635
Cos if you don't,

414
00:45:20,636 --> 00:45:23,809
your teeth gonna rot and your
breath to smell like gumbo?

415
00:45:23,810 --> 00:45:26,684
- You want that?

416
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:30,810
No you don't. Because then-THE.

417
00:45:43,319 --> 00:45:45,294
You had gumbo, too.

418
00:46:22,594 --> 00:46:24,226
Me and Mum are gonna
take off, okay?

419
00:46:24,227 --> 00:46:27,182
You guys aren't gonna
sleep over too?

420
00:46:27,183 --> 00:46:30,290
We already promised our friends
we are gonna kick with 'em tonight.

421
00:46:30,291 --> 00:46:33,937
But, We'll be back before

422
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:38,578
No! Don't go.

423
00:46:40,342 --> 00:46:42,054
I'm scared.

424
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:44,040
Scared of what?

425
00:46:45,828 --> 00:46:48,349
I hear guns outside.

426
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:55,409
You know what, baby?

427
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:58,212
Those are just firecrackers.

428
00:46:58,213 --> 00:47:01,029
You'll be safe inside,
with your cousin.

429
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:03,518
But what about you Daddy?

430
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:04,719
Me?

431
00:47:06,565 --> 00:47:08,286
Baby, I'll be fine.

432
00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:10,389
I'll tell you what, though.

433
00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:13,387
When we wake up in the morning,
we'll play "Candyland".

434
00:47:13,388 --> 00:47:15,738
And then guess what
we can do after that?

435
00:47:17,047 --> 00:47:19,295
- Go to the park?
- Better.

436
00:47:19,296 --> 00:47:20,495
"Toys'R'Us?"

437
00:47:20,496 --> 00:47:22,816

00:47:22,817 --> 00:47:24,016
What?

439
00:47:24,017 --> 00:47:26,788
I don't know, maybe...

440
00:47:26,789 --> 00:47:27,988
Chuck e Cheese's.

441
00:47:27,989 --> 00:47:29,188
Really?

442
00:47:29,189 --> 00:47:30,388
I promise.

443
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:33,890
Daddy's gonna give you heck of tokens
and we'll play all the games.

444
00:47:33,891 --> 00:47:35,873
Maybe, we'll get you
ya favourite pizza.

445
00:47:35,874 --> 00:47:37,073
I want you to eat it all up.

446
00:47:37,074 --> 00:47:40,007
Even Mummy, cos she
can't have carbs.

447
00:47:41,657 --> 00:47:43,305
What's a carb?

448
00:47:45,304 --> 00:47:48,232
You ain't gotta worry
about that right now.

449
00:47:54,536 --> 00:47:55,905
I love you.

450

504
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:27,958
No shit.

505

I'm gonna need a chest tube.

636
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:45,002
We gotta get him
upstairs, right away.

637
01:09:54,568 --> 01:09:55,640
Excuse me.

638
01:09:55,641 --> 01:09:58,801
My son is Oscar Julius Grant III. He's
been shot, and they told me to come here.

639
01:09:58,826 --> 01:09:59,839
N-T. Yes.

640
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:04,061
Okay, he's in surgery. Go to the
ICU and someone will be out soon.

641
01:10:04,062 --> 01:10:05,542
- And then, where?
- Right there.

642
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:11,810
Is that blood in?

643
01:10:14,252 --> 01:10:15,564
Scissors.

644
01:10:17,708 --> 01:10:19,109
Suction.

645
01:10:52,710 --> 01:10:55,111
Hey, listen. None of that.

646
01:10:55,112 --> 01:10:56,311
None of that.

647
01:10:56,312 --> 01:10:58,330
It's not the time or the place.

648
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:11,420
Hey, we gotta keep him positive.

649
01:11:12,830 --> 01:11:15,868
We gotta. We gotta let these
people do their job.

650
01:11:15,869 --> 01:11:17,068
He's gonna be fine.

651
01:11:17,069 --> 01:11:20,178
Let's put all our energy
toward Oscar right now.

652
01:11:20,179 --> 01:11:21,378
I know y'all are upset.

653
01:11:21,379 --> 01:11:25,332
We gotta lift him up.
Let's keep him lifted up.

654
01:11:26,665 --> 01:11:28,393
Let's keep him lifted up.

655
01:11:40,016 --> 01:11:41,202
- Mrs. Johnson?
- Yes.

656
01:11:42,956 --> 01:11:44,347
How is he? How is he?

657
01:11:44,348 --> 01:11:46,853
Mrs. Johnson, as you know..

658
01:11:46,854 --> 01:11:48,054
Your son has been shot.

659
01:11:48,170 --> 01:11:50,183
We've stabilized him,

660
01:11:50,184 --> 01:11:51,384
but he's critical.

661
01:11:53,482 --> 01:11:54,777
Critical. What is that?

662
01:11:54,778 --> 01:11:58,615
Well, he has massive internal bleeding
and we had to remove the right lung.

663
01:11:58,616 --> 01:12:03,281
His lung? How is he... How is
he going to be able to breathe?

664
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:06,174
He's on a breathing
machine, right now.

665
01:12:06,175 --> 01:12:07,375
His breathing is stable.

666
01:12:08,568 --> 01:12:10,960
The main problem is the
internal bleeding.

667
01:12:11,980 --> 01:12:15,594
We've had some difficulty
stopping the bleeding..

668
01:12:15,595 --> 01:12:17,116
That's getting his
blood to clot.

669
01:12:17,370 --> 01:12:20,666
He hasn't fully responded
to the transfusions, yet.

670
01:12:20,667 --> 01:12:22,569
But he's going to make it right?

671
01:12:22,570 --> 01:12:23,769
But he's going to make it.

672
01:12:23,770 --> 01:12:26,198
I promise you, we're gonna
do everything we can okay?

673
01:12:32,930 --> 01:12:36,139
Please do whatever
you can, please.

674
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:45,122
We gotta lift him up, you all.

675
01:12:45,123 --> 01:12:47,740
We gotta lift Oscar up.

676
01:13:30,607 --> 01:13:32,112
You all, let's pray.

677
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:42,959
<i>Heavenly father...</i>

678
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:47,538
<i>We kneel before you..
And ask you..</i>

679
01:13:47,539 --> 01:13:50,837
<i>To put your healing hands
around your child.</i>

680
01:13:52,167 --> 01:13:54,074
<i>We ask you dear Lord...</i>

681
01:13:54,075 --> 01:13:56,880
<i>to operate through
these doctors;</i>

682
01:13:59,571 --> 01:14:03,730
<i>Breathe strength into their hands
Lord, as they work on him.</i>

683
01:14:05,668 --> 01:14:08,412
<i>We are asking you right
now, to heal him.</i>

684
01:14:09,980 --> 01:14:15,545
<i>Heal him Lord, so we can hold
him and see his smile again.</i>

685
01:14:15,546 --> 01:14:19,723
<i>In your name, we pray. Amen.</i>

686
01:15:11,441 --> 01:15:12,802
He didn't make it.

687
01:15:19,414 --> 01:15:21,639
I need to see him.

688
01:15:23,498 --> 01:15:24,991
Okay, you can see him.

689
01:15:24,992 --> 01:15:27,880
But they don't want you go
into the room and detach him.

690
01:15:27,881 --> 01:15:30,092
Cos they ruled it a homicide.

691
01:15:30,093 --> 01:15:32,628
I need to see him.

692
01:15:34,441 --> 01:15:36,640
I need to see him.

693
01:15:36,641 --> 01:15:37,841
- I can take her.
- Okay.

694
01:16:20,621 --> 01:16:22,733
I told him to catch the train.

695
01:16:24,172 --> 01:16:26,970
I told him to catch Bart!

696
01:16:26,971 --> 01:16:30,066
I didn't know they
were gonna hurt him.

697
01:16:32,237 --> 01:16:34,281
I should have just
let him drive.

698
01:16:34,282 --> 01:16:37,862
I should have let him drive.
I wanted him to be safe.

699
01:16:43,443 --> 01:16:45,160
You gotta let me hug him.

700
01:16:45,161 --> 01:16:48,314
Please, let me hug him. Please.

701
01:16:49,796 --> 01:16:52,587
He didn't like to be alone!

702
01:17:11,590 --> 01:17:13,236
Come on, T.

703
01:17:35,757 --> 01:17:37,389
Where's Daddy?
