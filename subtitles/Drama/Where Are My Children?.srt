1
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,699
What do you say to a few hoops?

2
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:30,461
Are you out of your mind?

3
00:01:31,271 --> 00:01:32,237
Possibly.

4
00:01:32,272 --> 00:01:34,007
I've been cooped up in
a ship for five days.

5
00:01:34,042 --> 00:01:35,506
Well I'm sorry for you, fella,

6
00:01:35,541 --> 00:01:36,970
but I gotta conserve my strength.

7
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:41,337
I.. I get married on Tuesday.

8
00:01:41,882 --> 00:01:42,849
Brilliant.

9
00:01:45,585 --> 00:01:47,821
That's if I get back
from Nanjing on time.

10
00:01:47,856 --> 00:01:49,448
I drive for the Red Cross.

11
00:01:50,424 --> 00:01:51,391
Really?

12
00:01:51,658 --> 00:01:52,624
You're going to Nanjing?

13
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:54,354
Yeah. Two days before my wedding.

14
00:01:55,262 --> 00:01:56,729
I'd say that calls for a drink.

15
00:01:57,531 --> 00:01:59,624
- Okay.
- Maybe I can help your plans along.

16
00:01:59,866 --> 00:02:00,855
All right.

17
00:02:13,814 --> 00:02:16,783
I repeat. Nanjing is closed to the press.

18
00:02:17,117 --> 00:02:19,085
Ask the Japs. It's their call.

19
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,120
Not ours.

20
00:02:20,155 --> 00:02:21,120
Barnes!

21
00:02:21,555 --> 00:02:23,288
This is my good friend Andy..

22
00:02:23,323 --> 00:02:25,325
Fisher.
- Fisher. Terrific fellow.

23
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,493
He's here to see his girl.

24
00:02:26,528 --> 00:02:27,959
I'm George Hogg.

25
00:02:27,994 --> 00:02:30,360
- Hi, Daisy.
- Meet Roger Appsley.

26
00:02:30,897 --> 00:02:33,266
An ungrateful shit from
the British Embassy.

27
00:02:33,301 --> 00:02:35,359
Mr. Fisher and I have already met.

28
00:02:36,536 --> 00:02:37,833
Hey, there you are!

29
00:02:38,905 --> 00:02:40,133
Excuse me, gentlemen?

30
00:02:41,975 --> 00:02:43,033
That's his girl?

31
00:02:43,443 --> 00:02:45,070
He's marrying her on Tuesday.

32
00:02:45,545 --> 00:02:47,012
He won't be here on Tuesday.

33
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,646
He's headed straight for
hell himself in the morning.

34
00:02:52,052 --> 00:02:53,954
You bastard! You've got him
a pass to Nanjing?

35
00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:54,920
Barnes!

36
00:02:54,955 --> 00:02:56,456
How long have we known each other,
you arsehole? Ten years?

37
00:02:56,491 --> 00:02:57,724
Will you excuse us, Mr. Appsley?

38
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:58,884
Come on, Barnes..

39
00:02:59,092 --> 00:03:00,252
He's not press.

40
00:03:00,594 --> 00:03:02,010
Andy Fisher. Red Cross.

41
00:03:02,045 --> 00:03:03,427
That's why he got a pass.

42
00:03:16,009 --> 00:03:17,476
I made a deal with Andy Fisher.

43
00:03:18,378 --> 00:03:20,869
He gave me
his Red Cross papers and his truck.

44
00:03:21,615 --> 00:03:23,048
They'll get us into Nanjing.

45
00:03:23,316 --> 00:03:25,079
Barnes, we've got a scoop.

46
00:03:27,387 --> 00:03:28,649
I'm Andy Fisher.

47
00:03:29,456 --> 00:03:30,582
You're David Barcley.

48
00:03:31,725 --> 00:03:33,460
We're accredited drivers
for the Red Cross,

49
00:03:33,495 --> 00:03:35,485
bringing medical supplies to Nanjing.

50
00:03:36,897 --> 00:03:38,091
In this..

51
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:41,067
Andy Fisher's in love, Barnes.

52
00:03:41,668 --> 00:03:43,067
He wants to get married.

53
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:44,662
Now everybody's happy.

54
00:03:45,005 --> 00:03:46,267
Christ, you're nuts!

55
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:00,520
Damn! Eddie!

56
00:04:00,555 --> 00:04:01,520
Eddie?

57
00:04:01,555 --> 00:04:02,721
Eddie Wei. He's in the back.

58
00:04:02,756 --> 00:04:04,291
You know. The photographer from U.P.

59
00:04:04,326 --> 00:04:05,543
I know who the hell he is.

60
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:06,725
But what's he doing here?

61
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,523
He was desperate to come with us.

62
00:04:27,647 --> 00:04:29,547
Set your watch an hour ahead, Daisy.

63
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,745
We're now on Tokyo time.

64
00:04:39,326 --> 00:04:40,987
Do you want to know
what they're saying in Tokyo?

65
00:04:41,494 --> 00:04:43,563
They say they're trying to
help the Chinese.

66
00:04:43,598 --> 00:04:44,963
But it's chaos over here.

67
00:04:44,998 --> 00:04:47,364
Warlords, corruption, civil war.

68
00:04:47,801 --> 00:04:49,780
The Nationalists against the Communists.

69
00:04:49,815 --> 00:04:51,760
They say they're trying to restore order.

70
00:04:51,871 --> 00:04:53,171
That's all bullshit.

71
00:04:53,206 --> 00:04:54,739
They haven't declared war on China.

72
00:04:54,774 --> 00:04:57,402
I'll tell you why
they haven't declared war on China.

73
00:04:57,544 --> 00:04:59,077
It's because if they don't declare war,

74
00:04:59,112 --> 00:05:02,377
they don't have to treat captured
Chinese soldiers as prisoners of war.

75
00:05:02,849 --> 00:05:05,181
They don't have to play
by any goddamn rules at all.

76
00:05:05,418 --> 00:05:07,010
The Japanese are not savages.

77
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,085
But they've decided the Chinese are.

78
00:05:14,594 --> 00:05:16,027
Take a good long look, Daisy.

79
00:05:16,529 --> 00:05:19,794
There's thousands of them,
and they're all coming from Nanjing.

80
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,398
The next Great War's already begun.

81
00:05:22,802 --> 00:05:24,770
The folks back home
just don't know it yet.

82
00:05:39,085 --> 00:05:40,954
The papers say we're
both from the States.

83
00:05:40,989 --> 00:05:42,251
So try and talk American.

84
00:05:42,589 --> 00:05:43,556
Of course, old chap.

85
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:54,427
We're carrying Red Cross supplies..

86
00:05:54,968 --> 00:05:56,196
from the British Government.

87
00:05:58,438 --> 00:06:00,497
This must be searched.

88
00:06:18,058 --> 00:06:19,355
Excuse me, Lieutenant.

89
00:06:19,526 --> 00:06:22,017
These goods have been sterilized.

90
00:06:23,396 --> 00:06:26,456
Your men don't seem to understand..

91
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,630
that these goods..

92
00:06:29,936 --> 00:06:31,733
must be delivered safely.

93
00:06:42,282 --> 00:06:44,045
That's enough. Go back.

94
00:06:45,652 --> 00:06:46,619
Proceed.

95
00:07:05,505 --> 00:07:07,407
If you're not back here
by 9:00 tomorrow night,

96
00:07:07,442 --> 00:07:08,408
I'll go without you.

97
00:07:08,443 --> 00:07:09,397
Okay.

98
00:07:15,215 --> 00:07:16,182
Good luck, Eddie.

99
00:11:44,117 --> 00:11:45,084
Get me the cigarette.

100
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:53,726
You are safe now.

101
00:11:57,263 --> 00:11:58,230
What's your name?

102
00:12:01,534 --> 00:12:02,865
What is your nationality?

103
00:12:06,439 --> 00:12:07,406
British?

104
00:12:08,508 --> 00:12:10,339
And you're a journalist?

105
00:12:10,777 --> 00:12:11,743
How did you know that?

106
00:12:11,778 --> 00:12:14,180
Nobody but a journalist
would walk into Nanjing

107
00:12:14,215 --> 00:12:16,080
armed with nothing but a sports coat.

108
00:12:16,449 --> 00:12:18,818
The enemy's patrol team is
six streets away from us.

109
00:12:18,853 --> 00:12:19,817
What is this place?

110
00:12:19,852 --> 00:12:20,853
What's going on? Who are you?

111
00:12:20,888 --> 00:12:22,086
It's the Tax Office.

112
00:12:22,121 --> 00:12:24,282
And my name is Chen. Han-Sheng Chen.

113
00:12:24,624 --> 00:12:25,784
Han-Sheng Chen?

114
00:12:26,225 --> 00:12:27,658
Call me Jack, why don't you.

115
00:12:29,729 --> 00:12:32,425
So, why were they going to kill you?

116
00:12:32,765 --> 00:12:35,029
The Japs usually leave
British nationals alone.

117
00:12:35,635 --> 00:12:37,904
- I saw something I shouldn't have.
- Got it.

118
00:12:37,939 --> 00:12:39,496
I took photographs. They found them.

119
00:12:39,572 --> 00:12:40,630
Oh. No wonder..

120
00:12:41,374 --> 00:12:44,070
Pardon my ignorance, but what
are you doing in the Tax Office?

121
00:12:44,177 --> 00:12:45,591
They're killing people out there.

122
00:12:45,626 --> 00:12:47,005
We are completely outnumbered here.

123
00:12:47,246 --> 00:12:48,613
And the Japs are better armed.

124
00:12:48,648 --> 00:12:51,412
So we are going to fight another day.

125
00:12:52,785 --> 00:12:53,752
Hold this..

126
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:57,885
But before we go,
we're going to blow up a few buildings.

127
00:12:58,357 --> 00:13:00,158
They are very orderly, the Japanese.

128
00:13:00,193 --> 00:13:02,627
They hate it when we
blow up a city's records.

129
00:13:02,862 --> 00:13:04,853
Let's go out. Hurry..

130
00:13:07,133 --> 00:13:08,100
Thank you.

131
00:13:14,273 --> 00:13:15,297
Wait me out there.

132
00:13:18,978 --> 00:13:20,468
We'll try for the British consulate.

133
00:13:21,314 --> 00:13:23,214
They may be able to
get you out of Nanjing.

134
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:25,417
You have to leave.

135
00:13:25,918 --> 00:13:27,852
You have to tell the world
what's happening here.

136
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:32,416
I love this part

137
00:13:42,101 --> 00:13:43,932
Come on. Your friends should be this way.

138
00:13:51,043 --> 00:13:52,510
Take it easy, Daisy.

139
00:13:53,346 --> 00:13:54,479
I have a pass.

140
00:13:54,514 --> 00:13:55,882
I have a pass in my pocket.

141
00:13:55,917 --> 00:13:56,948
Shoot him!

142
00:13:56,983 --> 00:13:58,143
There's nothing we can do.

143
00:14:00,586 --> 00:14:01,746
Shoot him!

144
00:14:02,155 --> 00:14:03,713
You're too reckless, George.

145
00:14:55,741 --> 00:14:58,266
Shoot him.. Shoot him..

146
00:15:00,179 --> 00:15:01,146
Hey..

147
00:15:02,915 --> 00:15:04,576
You were hit pretty bad.

148
00:15:05,318 --> 00:15:08,651
Was I? I didn't feel a thing.

149
00:15:09,188 --> 00:15:11,213
Must've been the cold numbing the pain.

150
00:15:11,624 --> 00:15:14,855
Most of your blood's
gone down the Yangtze. But

151
00:15:15,394 --> 00:15:17,055
- I decided you'll live.

152
00:15:18,831 --> 00:15:21,061
I hope you're going to thank him
for saving your life.

153
00:15:21,968 --> 00:15:23,196
Thank you once again.

154
00:15:23,636 --> 00:15:26,002
She was talking to me. Right, Lee?

155
00:15:27,173 --> 00:15:30,506
So. You are in a hospital bed.

156
00:15:30,743 --> 00:15:32,768
- What?
- You talk a lot in your sleep.

157
00:15:33,746 --> 00:15:34,804
What about you?

158
00:15:35,381 --> 00:15:38,282
You didn't learn your English at Berlitz,
if I may say so.

159
00:15:38,918 --> 00:15:40,010
West Point.

160
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:43,010
- I thought you were a Communist
- I am.

161
00:15:43,389 --> 00:15:44,788
Figure it out yourself.

162
00:15:45,124 --> 00:15:48,582
And when you do, you will understand
much more about China.

163
00:15:53,866 --> 00:15:56,391
I never thought of you
as the kind to pick up strays.

164
00:15:56,702 --> 00:15:58,226
Not male ones, anyhow.

165
00:15:59,205 --> 00:16:01,537
I can't just dump him out here, can I?

166
00:16:01,674 --> 00:16:04,006
Well he won't be up to
much for at least a month.

167
00:16:04,744 --> 00:16:06,405
I can't get him back to Shanghai.

168
00:16:07,446 --> 00:16:10,077
So, Miss Pearson.
Tell me what in God's name

169
00:16:10,112 --> 00:16:12,709
I'm going to do with
a six-foot Oxford graduate

170
00:16:12,818 --> 00:16:14,843
- who can't speak a word of Chinese.

171
00:16:23,629 --> 00:16:24,595
Jack!

172
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,825
Have you ever heard of
a place called Huang Shi?

173
00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:32,264
You know I came back to
China to teach engineering.

174
00:16:32,538 --> 00:16:35,234
Now I'm teaching peasants
how to blow things up.

175
00:16:35,641 --> 00:16:37,700
To tell you the truth,
it's much more fun.

176
00:16:38,544 --> 00:16:39,511
Seriously.

177
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:43,248
Seriously. I travel around to
organize the resistance,

178
00:16:43,449 --> 00:16:45,542
and try to stay ahead
of the Japanese army.

179
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:48,187
I have to leave tomorrow.

180
00:16:48,222 --> 00:16:49,347
Take me with you.

181
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:54,193
How fit do I need to be to
use a typewriter, for God's sake?

182
00:16:54,228 --> 00:16:55,751
I'm not worried about you.

183
00:16:56,329 --> 00:16:59,594
I'm worried about the poor bastards
who have to carry you around with them.

184
00:17:00,032 --> 00:17:02,262
But there is a place
up in the North-West.

185
00:17:02,335 --> 00:17:04,098
It's called Huang Shi.

186
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:07,430
It's somewhere you can pick up
good background material

187
00:17:07,506 --> 00:17:10,100
and work on your Chinese
while you are convalescing,

188
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:11,801
before you go on to the front.

189
00:17:18,517 --> 00:17:19,484
Very good.

190
00:17:19,552 --> 00:17:20,519
Did you understand it?

191
00:17:20,586 --> 00:17:23,419
I certainly did. You said -

192
00:17:23,756 --> 00:17:25,485
"Let me introduce myself."

193
00:17:25,624 --> 00:17:27,524
"I am a pumpkin."

194
00:17:30,329 --> 00:17:32,820
This area is controlled
by the Communists -

195
00:17:33,165 --> 00:17:36,191
this by our Nationalist brothers-in-arms.

196
00:17:36,702 --> 00:17:39,694
You will take the train
as far as Pao-Chi here,

197
00:17:40,106 --> 00:17:41,903
and Huang Shi's right about here.

198
00:17:42,007 --> 00:17:43,338
That's where you're going.

199
00:17:48,514 --> 00:17:50,243
- Chen?
- Hey! Get down!

200
00:17:54,186 --> 00:17:56,155
What's the matter?
They're not the Japanese.

201
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:57,281
No. They are not.

202
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,425
They're the government troops
of Chiang Kai-Sek.

203
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,058
- Nationalists?
- Yeah.

204
00:18:01,093 --> 00:18:03,152
- I thought you were brothers.
- Sometimes.

205
00:18:03,229 --> 00:18:05,823
I thought you were fighting together
against the Japanese.

206
00:18:06,432 --> 00:18:08,866
When it suits them - or us.

207
00:18:09,702 --> 00:18:12,170
This could be one of those times. Or..

208
00:18:12,438 --> 00:18:13,700
maybe not.

209
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:18,468
What are they doing here?

210
00:18:18,544 --> 00:18:20,711
They are conscripts.
From the south.

211
00:18:20,746 --> 00:18:22,548
They like to take them
far from their homes,

212
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,641
so they are less likely to run away.

213
00:18:47,673 --> 00:18:49,197
They're trapped..

214
00:18:57,116 --> 00:18:58,674
Leave. Hurry!

215
00:20:49,295 --> 00:20:50,319
Hello?

216
00:20:53,332 --> 00:20:54,458
Hello?

217
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:04,732
Who's in charge here?

218
00:21:15,421 --> 00:21:17,321
This is for the person in charge.

219
00:21:19,592 --> 00:21:20,889
I said,

220
00:21:21,493 --> 00:21:23,825
this is for the person in charge.

221
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:26,420
Esteemed Headmaster..

222
00:21:26,832 --> 00:21:30,233
I have the pleasure of introducing..

223
00:21:30,569 --> 00:21:34,266
the great Oxford University scholar..

224
00:21:35,007 --> 00:21:36,031
George..

225
00:21:36,575 --> 00:21:37,542
Pig.

226
00:21:40,846 --> 00:21:44,179
I am in charge, Mister.. Pig.

227
00:21:46,318 --> 00:21:49,185
It says 'Pig'.

228
00:21:52,691 --> 00:21:54,090
How is it you speak English?

229
00:21:54,426 --> 00:21:56,189
I'm not a peasant like these others.

230
00:21:56,962 --> 00:21:58,190
I am Liu Shi-Kai.

231
00:21:58,731 --> 00:22:00,596
My father is a Government Official.

232
00:22:03,535 --> 00:22:04,729
Hello?

233
00:22:07,172 --> 00:22:10,039
You think I can cook with just a pot?

234
00:22:10,943 --> 00:22:12,103
Come and see..

235
00:22:15,881 --> 00:22:18,247
I have nothing.. look.

236
00:22:20,285 --> 00:22:22,253
All I have is this.

237
00:22:32,231 --> 00:22:33,289
Grown-ups.

238
00:22:34,299 --> 00:22:35,596
Teachers.

239
00:22:36,235 --> 00:22:37,224
Where?

240
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:40,170
Gone.. all gone.

241
00:22:41,306 --> 00:22:42,830
Do you have any rice?

242
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:19,507
Get up.

243
00:23:20,512 --> 00:23:21,706
Get up.

244
00:23:32,191 --> 00:23:33,180
Hurry

245
00:23:50,142 --> 00:23:51,131
Who's there?

246
00:24:13,766 --> 00:24:14,798
Miss Lee

247
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:16,630
The boys have taken the Englishman.

248
00:24:26,478 --> 00:24:28,105
That's enough!

249
00:24:29,681 --> 00:24:31,682
Touch him again..

250
00:24:31,717 --> 00:24:34,709
I'm out of here forever.

251
00:24:35,154 --> 00:24:36,186
She's bluffing.

252
00:24:36,221 --> 00:24:39,748
You give me one good reason
why I should be bluffing, Shi-Kai.

253
00:24:52,037 --> 00:24:53,834
Here. Let me take a look at that.

254
00:24:54,273 --> 00:24:56,104
You're the nurse, aren't you? Lee..

255
00:24:56,875 --> 00:24:57,864
Lee Pearson.

256
00:24:58,243 --> 00:24:59,411
How do you do? I'm George -

257
00:24:59,446 --> 00:25:00,708
I know who you are.

258
00:25:01,847 --> 00:25:03,610
It was my idea to send you here.

259
00:25:05,117 --> 00:25:08,553
'The great Oxford University scholar.'

260
00:25:09,755 --> 00:25:12,622
Jack Chen has given you
quite an introduction here.

261
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:16,492
Except he's called you 'Mr. Pig'.

262
00:25:16,929 --> 00:25:18,123
It's not that funny.

263
00:25:25,003 --> 00:25:27,105
He's a very nasty bit of work, that one.

264
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,231
I can't think why.

265
00:25:29,341 --> 00:25:31,002
He only saw his father beheaded,

266
00:25:31,276 --> 00:25:32,958
his mother raped and beheaded,

267
00:25:32,993 --> 00:25:34,641
his sister raped and beheaded..

268
00:25:35,314 --> 00:25:38,817
After that they lined him
up on the edge of a pit

269
00:25:38,852 --> 00:25:39,983
He's a smart kid.

270
00:25:40,018 --> 00:25:41,720
He waited until he felt the guy
next to him get hit

271
00:25:41,755 --> 00:25:43,017
Stop. Please.

272
00:25:44,223 --> 00:25:45,924
Nanjing. I was there.

273
00:25:45,959 --> 00:25:47,124
Jack told me.

274
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:48,992
That's why I thought you'd be good here.

275
00:25:49,027 --> 00:25:51,196
You're going to need
a Chinese name, you know.

276
00:25:51,231 --> 00:25:52,356
One they can actually say.

277
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,267
Ho-ke.

278
00:25:56,468 --> 00:25:58,595
You're out of your mind
if you think I'm staying here.

279
00:25:59,071 --> 00:26:00,389
I didn't come half way round the world

280
00:26:00,424 --> 00:26:01,707
to play nanny to a bunch of savages.

281
00:26:01,742 --> 00:26:03,407
- Okay.
- So in the morning,

282
00:26:03,442 --> 00:26:06,378
if you'd kindly point me in the
direction of the war and I'll be off.

283
00:26:06,413 --> 00:26:07,606
I said okay.

284
00:26:09,982 --> 00:26:11,882
Why do they give you such a wide berth?

285
00:26:12,551 --> 00:26:14,314
Out here people die all the time.

286
00:26:14,553 --> 00:26:16,885
Typhus, cholera, tetanus.

287
00:26:17,222 --> 00:26:18,523
Anyone gives me any trouble,

288
00:26:18,558 --> 00:26:19,690
I just tell them:

289
00:26:19,725 --> 00:26:21,093
'One day you graze yourself.

290
00:26:21,128 --> 00:26:22,426
You'll think it's nothing.'

291
00:26:22,461 --> 00:26:24,622
'Next day you wake up with a fever.'

292
00:26:24,897 --> 00:26:26,965
'You think it's a cold. That's all.'

293
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,229
'Pretty soon your bones ache,

294
00:26:29,534 --> 00:26:32,402
your jaw locks,
your teeth clamp together.. '

295
00:26:32,437 --> 00:26:36,942
'.. and slowly, very,
very slowly, you die of tetanus.'

296
00:26:36,977 --> 00:26:39,578
In my bag I have vaccines
when I can get them.

297
00:26:39,613 --> 00:26:42,240
If I go, the bag goes with me. So..

298
00:26:43,582 --> 00:26:45,106
Who's going to mess with me?

299
00:26:45,884 --> 00:26:47,218
Why don't they just close this school

300
00:26:47,253 --> 00:26:48,553
and send the boys home to their families?

301
00:26:48,588 --> 00:26:49,815
This isn't a school.

302
00:26:50,088 --> 00:26:51,618
It looks like a school.

303
00:26:51,653 --> 00:26:53,148
This is an orphanage.

304
00:26:53,792 --> 00:26:56,461
Every one of them
has a story, just like Shi-Kai's.

305
00:26:56,496 --> 00:26:57,963
Now you want to find your war,

306
00:26:57,998 --> 00:26:59,596
Mr. Hogg? Look around.

307
00:26:59,631 --> 00:27:01,064
Because they don't need a teacher.

308
00:27:01,099 --> 00:27:04,796
What they need is someone who can
make them care whether they live or die.

309
00:27:21,253 --> 00:27:23,722
The beds are crawling with lice.

310
00:27:23,757 --> 00:27:25,189
The kids are too.

311
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:26,416
How adorable.

312
00:27:26,992 --> 00:27:28,091
No joke.

313
00:27:28,126 --> 00:27:29,855
Body lice carry typhus.

314
00:27:30,896 --> 00:27:33,865
Okay. Now for the boys.

315
00:27:34,032 --> 00:27:35,266
What are you going to do?

316
00:27:35,301 --> 00:27:36,501
Boil them? Jolly good!

317
00:27:36,536 --> 00:27:37,695
Flea powder.

318
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:40,337
I haven't been able to
get my hands on any before.

319
00:27:40,372 --> 00:27:45,277
But the thing is to figure out how to
make them understand it won't hurt.

320
00:27:45,312 --> 00:27:46,608
I'm sure you'll manage.

321
00:27:49,348 --> 00:27:50,940
Ho-Ke has lice on him.

322
00:27:51,683 --> 00:27:52,911
Scratch.

323
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,055
The lice could make him sick.

324
00:28:00,993 --> 00:28:03,518
This powder will kill the lice..

325
00:28:04,629 --> 00:28:07,530
but will do him no harm to him.

326
00:28:09,267 --> 00:28:10,291
Smile.

327
00:28:13,271 --> 00:28:15,034
So Ho-Ke is very happy.

328
00:28:15,741 --> 00:28:17,265
Now take off your clothes.

329
00:28:18,577 --> 00:28:21,273
Oh, for Pete's sake,
it's nothing I haven't seen before.

330
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,786
Hands..

331
00:29:07,459 --> 00:29:08,725
Slow down

332
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,954
Don't do that, the water is cold.

333
00:29:20,439 --> 00:29:21,938
Here's to you, George.

334
00:29:21,973 --> 00:29:23,770
I haven't had a real
coffee since Shanghai.

335
00:29:24,509 --> 00:29:26,101
So, why China?

336
00:29:26,411 --> 00:29:27,571
Because it's in trouble.

337
00:29:28,313 --> 00:29:30,543
Because everyone back home
is waiting for the shoe to drop

338
00:29:31,116 --> 00:29:32,481
- waiting for the next war.

339
00:29:32,884 --> 00:29:35,216
It's like being stuck in a cellar
waiting for a storm to break.

340
00:29:35,921 --> 00:29:37,445
I went to the States first.

341
00:29:38,256 --> 00:29:40,190
Hitchhiked across the country - twice.

342
00:29:40,826 --> 00:29:43,420
But they're hunched down in their
bunk holes even deeper than we are.

343
00:29:44,196 --> 00:29:46,630
"War? What war, mister?

344
00:29:46,665 --> 00:29:48,132
We're in a Depression here."

345
00:29:49,734 --> 00:29:51,258
And so then I went on to Japan.

346
00:29:51,636 --> 00:29:53,069
Learned some Japanese.

347
00:29:53,405 --> 00:29:55,464
And they'll tell you
they don't want war either

348
00:29:56,108 --> 00:29:57,234
- just ask them.

349
00:29:59,678 --> 00:30:01,339
And then I went to Nanjing.

350
00:30:02,614 --> 00:30:04,707
And I saw unspeakable things.

351
00:30:06,318 --> 00:30:08,013
I begged Jack Chen to kill a man.

352
00:30:09,921 --> 00:30:11,684
I never knew I had hate like that in me.

353
00:30:12,424 --> 00:30:15,327
Everybody feels hate sometimes

354
00:30:15,362 --> 00:30:17,625
No. Not us.

355
00:30:19,097 --> 00:30:21,395
You see, my family are pacifists.

356
00:30:21,766 --> 00:30:23,033
And not just your quiet,

357
00:30:23,068 --> 00:30:25,298
normal, private pacifists
oh no,

358
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:26,762
they're famous for it.

359
00:30:29,007 --> 00:30:30,998
My mother had Gandhi to tea.

360
00:30:32,477 --> 00:30:34,911
And my father
went to jail during the last War.

361
00:30:36,748 --> 00:30:38,215
He's the bravest man I know.

362
00:30:40,752 --> 00:30:42,515
And now I think they're wrong.

363
00:30:43,455 --> 00:30:45,389
I think there are times one must fight.

364
00:31:10,182 --> 00:31:11,376
Couldn't sleep?

365
00:31:12,984 --> 00:31:14,144
Me neither.

366
00:31:15,287 --> 00:31:17,255
One of the kids had 'the runs.'

367
00:31:17,856 --> 00:31:19,255
God-awful mess.

368
00:31:20,692 --> 00:31:23,495
- You can keep the mule, by the way.
- You're leaving?

369
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:25,520
I've got a bunch of
medical stations to run.

370
00:31:26,264 --> 00:31:28,164
I only stopped off to
bring you that grain.

371
00:31:29,134 --> 00:31:32,269
My guess, it'll last
you about three weeks.

372
00:31:32,304 --> 00:31:34,738
After that, you'll have to
try to find them something.

373
00:31:34,806 --> 00:31:36,000
It's up to you.

374
00:31:36,074 --> 00:31:37,166
But when will you be back?

375
00:31:37,609 --> 00:31:38,576
May.

376
00:31:39,044 --> 00:31:40,243
But this is March!

377
00:31:40,278 --> 00:31:42,109
They're like kids anywhere, George.

378
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:44,510
They need to be warm,
safe, clean and fed.

379
00:31:44,545 --> 00:31:46,841
Now if you can manage even one of those,

380
00:31:47,085 --> 00:31:48,153
you'll be ahead of the game.

381
00:31:48,188 --> 00:31:49,347
Now you listen to me.

382
00:31:49,554 --> 00:31:50,705
I'm not staying here.

383
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,932
You find someone else!

384
00:31:51,967 --> 00:31:53,245
There is no-one else.

385
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,523
You have to stay, George.

386
00:32:01,466 --> 00:32:02,433
Bugger.

387
00:33:25,617 --> 00:33:28,484
It keeps the wind out.

388
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,887
Rip it off.

389
00:34:04,923 --> 00:34:06,788
You. Come and help me?

390
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,684
Yes, you. Come.

391
00:34:25,744 --> 00:34:26,768
Thank you

392
00:34:34,953 --> 00:34:36,511
Stones

393
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,967
Chair.

394
00:34:50,935 --> 00:34:51,902
Chair.

395
00:34:53,605 --> 00:34:54,936
Student.

396
00:34:56,441 --> 00:34:58,739
Student.

397
00:34:59,477 --> 00:35:02,571
Student. That's you.

398
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:06,517
Teacher.

399
00:35:06,951 --> 00:35:08,179
I guess that means me.

400
00:35:11,055 --> 00:35:13,123
- Student. Teacher.

401
00:35:13,158 --> 00:35:15,183
- I'm looking for Merchant Wang.

402
00:35:22,634 --> 00:35:24,829
Where would I find Merchant Wang?

403
00:35:35,413 --> 00:35:38,644
Hello, My name is Hogg

404
00:35:39,684 --> 00:35:41,845
I am looking for Merchant Wang

405
00:35:42,921 --> 00:35:45,481
Please excuse my poor house, Mr. Hogg.

406
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:48,017
It has fallen on evil times.

407
00:35:48,493 --> 00:35:49,460
The war?

408
00:35:49,828 --> 00:35:54,390
War. Revolution.
Also gambling. Also opium.

409
00:35:55,066 --> 00:35:58,661
So many ways to spend
money and to get nothing in return.

410
00:35:59,737 --> 00:36:01,830
I take only solid currencies.

411
00:36:02,073 --> 00:36:04,943
If you can only pay in
Chinese dollars, then the price,

412
00:36:04,978 --> 00:36:06,968
I'm afraid, will have to double.

413
00:36:07,879 --> 00:36:09,972
I should like to pay in vegetables.

414
00:36:11,649 --> 00:36:14,209
Vegetables are solid currency.

415
00:36:16,688 --> 00:36:19,919
- English humour.
- You advance us the food and the seed

416
00:36:19,991 --> 00:36:21,324
- we do all the work.

417
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,122
You take your share of the harvest.

418
00:36:23,528 --> 00:36:25,325
Crops fail, Mr. Hogg.

419
00:36:33,705 --> 00:36:34,672
What is this?

420
00:36:38,343 --> 00:36:39,310
Durham wheat.

421
00:36:39,644 --> 00:36:41,077
Last year's harvest.

422
00:36:44,883 --> 00:36:46,077
Red lentils.

423
00:36:46,518 --> 00:36:48,850
I shouldn't think
they'd do well in this climate.

424
00:36:50,221 --> 00:36:51,620
We can do business.

425
00:36:54,192 --> 00:36:55,716
Please come again, Mr. Hogg.

426
00:36:56,094 --> 00:36:57,789
And send my regards to Miss Pearson.

427
00:36:58,463 --> 00:36:59,521
Yes, of course.

428
00:37:25,023 --> 00:37:27,774
Hope god will listen to us

429
00:37:27,809 --> 00:37:30,525
Let us have a good harvest

430
00:38:39,964 --> 00:38:41,295
It's good to be back.

431
00:38:42,667 --> 00:38:44,328
I'm sure you'll be pleased.

432
00:38:46,437 --> 00:38:47,404
Wei-Ping.

433
00:38:49,107 --> 00:38:50,074
- 'Dohh'

434
00:38:50,375 --> 00:38:51,486
Say it in English.

435
00:38:51,521 --> 00:38:52,598
This is a dog.

436
00:38:53,845 --> 00:38:54,929
Doh.

437
00:38:54,964 --> 00:38:56,013
Dog.

438
00:38:56,848 --> 00:38:58,941
Do-g.

439
00:39:00,218 --> 00:39:01,185
- Dog.

440
00:39:01,953 --> 00:39:03,944
- Dog.

441
00:39:04,122 --> 00:39:05,535
Dog.

442
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:06,948
- Dog.

443
00:39:08,593 --> 00:39:10,094
Don't be afraid.

444
00:39:10,129 --> 00:39:11,778
Dog..

445
00:39:11,813 --> 00:39:13,427
Dog..

446
00:39:13,698 --> 00:39:15,962
Dog..

447
00:39:19,637 --> 00:39:21,264
Why the lamp is off?

448
00:39:24,942 --> 00:39:26,432
Shi-kai! Don't!

449
00:39:44,395 --> 00:39:45,657
Oh Shi-Kai..

450
00:39:47,331 --> 00:39:49,162
You won't be able to save him, you know.

451
00:39:50,968 --> 00:39:53,198
You might be able to
limit the damage he can do.

452
00:39:54,572 --> 00:39:55,596
No more.

453
00:39:57,975 --> 00:39:59,772
You never told me
what brought you here, Lee.

454
00:40:01,212 --> 00:40:02,770
Freedom, I guess.

455
00:40:03,648 --> 00:40:04,706
And what happens?

456
00:40:05,483 --> 00:40:06,783
I end up in a dark hovel

457
00:40:06,818 --> 00:40:08,986
with centuries of soot
falling on my head..

458
00:40:09,021 --> 00:40:11,011
doing an amputation by candlelight.

459
00:40:11,089 --> 00:40:12,249
You're a surgeon, then?

460
00:40:12,423 --> 00:40:14,223
When a man's dying of gangrene,

461
00:40:14,258 --> 00:40:16,590
he tends not to
check the letters after your name.

462
00:40:18,229 --> 00:40:19,777
When there's no-one else,

463
00:40:19,812 --> 00:40:21,325
you do what has to be done.

464
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,362
I'm not really a nurse, either.

465
00:40:24,535 --> 00:40:27,026
Just like you.
You're not really a teacher.

466
00:40:28,706 --> 00:40:32,073
We're all something different in China.
That's why we came.

467
00:40:32,844 --> 00:40:35,246
I was supposed to be
an Army wife in Manila,

468
00:40:35,281 --> 00:40:36,679
but I couldn't play bridge.

469
00:40:38,049 --> 00:40:39,710
Funny how life works out.

470
00:40:44,155 --> 00:40:45,349
What on earth?

471
00:40:46,124 --> 00:40:47,421
It's my one treasure.

472
00:40:48,226 --> 00:40:50,474
- Do you dance, George?

473
00:40:50,509 --> 00:40:52,722
Oh, come on. Sure you do.

474
00:41:17,255 --> 00:41:19,155
It's good to see you, Lee.

475
00:41:55,526 --> 00:41:57,016
Are you going to stay?

476
00:41:57,962 --> 00:41:59,259
Oh, I think so.

477
00:42:00,431 --> 00:42:02,729
Awhile. And you?

478
00:42:04,502 --> 00:42:05,526
I think so.

479
00:42:06,938 --> 00:42:07,905
Yes.

480
00:42:31,863 --> 00:42:33,125
You know nothing!

481
00:42:34,165 --> 00:42:36,565
You stupid Gansu peasant.

482
00:43:08,733 --> 00:43:10,598
Let's take a look at this.

483
00:43:17,675 --> 00:43:19,108
Now let me see here..

484
00:43:21,712 --> 00:43:23,713
That's horrible.

485
00:43:23,748 --> 00:43:25,545
Brush your teeth every day.

486
00:43:27,385 --> 00:43:28,005
Ching..

487
00:43:28,006 --> 00:43:31,412
Oh, you can do it, just fine.
Just fine.

488
00:43:34,625 --> 00:43:36,456
"Though I am old with wandering.."

489
00:43:36,861 --> 00:43:38,796
"Through hollow lands and hilly lands.."

490
00:43:38,831 --> 00:43:39,762
Ho-Ke..

491
00:43:39,797 --> 00:43:41,662
"I'll find out where she has gone.."

492
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:45,162
"And kiss her lips and take her hands"

493
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:49,501
"And walk among
the long dappled grass.."

494
00:43:52,109 --> 00:43:53,076
Ching?

495
00:43:59,850 --> 00:44:00,976
It's all right.

496
00:44:01,652 --> 00:44:03,950
You're safe.
Nobody's going to hurt you, Ching.

497
00:44:43,461 --> 00:44:45,196
How's Uncle Jing today?

498
00:44:45,231 --> 00:44:46,963
His tumor is worse

499
00:44:46,998 --> 00:44:48,632
- and he wants more pipe.

500
00:44:48,667 --> 00:44:49,997
It'll kill him now.

501
00:44:51,168 --> 00:44:53,371
Maybe that won't be such a bad thing.

502
00:44:53,406 --> 00:44:54,337
I heard today,

503
00:44:54,372 --> 00:44:57,364
the Nationalists have found
a solution to the 'opium problem'.

504
00:44:58,175 --> 00:45:00,511
They're going to behead all the addicts.

505
00:45:00,546 --> 00:45:02,138
I heard the same thing.

506
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:05,680
Addicts - and people who deal in opium.

507
00:45:06,784 --> 00:45:09,412
The Japanese
behead you for being Chinese.

508
00:45:10,421 --> 00:45:11,752
So, Miss Pearson.

509
00:45:12,189 --> 00:45:13,679
What can I do for you?

510
00:45:18,396 --> 00:45:20,796
I was hoping you might
have some sulfa powder.

511
00:45:21,165 --> 00:45:24,965
Nobody's got sulfa powder.
Not even the Japanese.

512
00:45:27,671 --> 00:45:29,717
It will be sad for your friend.

513
00:45:29,752 --> 00:45:31,764
Nobody to talk to but those boys.

514
00:45:32,843 --> 00:45:34,428
I think he will be lonely.

515
00:45:34,463 --> 00:45:35,978
I think he'll be just fine.

516
00:45:36,013 --> 00:45:38,345
You say that
because you are never lonely.

517
00:45:40,384 --> 00:45:41,550
Well you should go visit him,

518
00:45:41,585 --> 00:45:42,716
if you think he's so lonely.

519
00:45:43,587 --> 00:45:47,250
I don't have time for the
problems of people with no problems.

520
00:45:47,992 --> 00:45:49,983
What do you have in the way of morphine?

521
00:45:54,765 --> 00:45:56,232
That's all you've got?

522
00:45:56,267 --> 00:45:58,667
No. But you're not my only customer.

523
00:46:02,473 --> 00:46:03,872
Take opium instead.

524
00:46:04,775 --> 00:46:06,436
You know what they say about opium.

525
00:46:07,011 --> 00:46:09,639
You still feel the pain,
but it doesn't hurt any more.

526
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:29,400
Six months ago they were filthy,
starving, diseased

527
00:46:29,435 --> 00:46:31,300
- and of no value to anyone.

528
00:46:31,802 --> 00:46:33,030
And now..

529
00:46:33,804 --> 00:46:35,431
I'm very impressed.

530
00:46:35,973 --> 00:46:37,469
I have to confess, Mr. Hogg.

531
00:46:37,504 --> 00:46:38,965
I did not think you could do it.

532
00:46:39,343 --> 00:46:41,868
I have to confess, Mrs. Wang,
neither did I.

533
00:46:45,449 --> 00:46:48,714
I hope you will do me
the honor of accepting a small gift.

534
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:57,225
Good Lord, it's in English.

535
00:46:57,761 --> 00:46:58,819
Where did you get it?

536
00:47:00,631 --> 00:47:02,595
A Missionary gave it to me for

537
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:04,559
being a.. very good girl.

538
00:47:08,772 --> 00:47:09,966
'The Silk Road.'

539
00:47:11,775 --> 00:47:15,836
It was the link between the East and West
for more than two thousand years.

540
00:47:16,981 --> 00:47:18,141
It seemed appropriate.

541
00:47:18,716 --> 00:47:19,683
Thank you.

542
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:24,951
May it seal our friendship.

543
00:47:26,590 --> 00:47:27,557
Yes.

544
00:47:59,123 --> 00:48:02,193
- Where have you come from?

545
00:48:02,228 --> 00:48:03,211
- Lingbao.

546
00:48:03,246 --> 00:48:04,160
Lingbao?

547
00:48:04,195 --> 00:48:05,662
We've walked for two days.

548
00:48:08,165 --> 00:48:09,632
I hate Japanese jet

549
00:48:09,667 --> 00:48:12,761
Don't worry, they often fly over.

550
00:48:14,004 --> 00:48:16,438
What's his name?

551
00:48:16,473 --> 00:48:18,304
- Number Four.
- Lao Si.

552
00:48:19,443 --> 00:48:20,637
And they are.. let's see..

553
00:48:21,512 --> 00:48:22,479
Number One.

554
00:48:22,947 --> 00:48:23,914
Number Two.

555
00:48:24,281 --> 00:48:25,339
Number Three.

556
00:48:25,916 --> 00:48:26,905
Number Four!

557
00:48:31,222 --> 00:48:33,087
Lie Down

558
00:49:57,574 --> 00:50:00,475
They are turning back, who are they?

559
00:50:24,134 --> 00:50:27,103
Try to sleep.

560
00:50:34,778 --> 00:50:36,006
No. No.

561
00:50:36,447 --> 00:50:37,505
Lao Si.

562
00:50:38,315 --> 00:50:41,614
- Ching?
- He's too young.

563
00:50:43,887 --> 00:50:46,651
Good night.

564
00:51:12,649 --> 00:51:14,241
Not wounded!

565
00:51:14,318 --> 00:51:15,818
Not wounded!

566
00:51:15,853 --> 00:51:18,151
Get him out of here!
Get him something to eat!

567
00:51:20,491 --> 00:51:24,693
We've had forty, no,
fifty guys in here today

568
00:51:24,728 --> 00:51:28,164
who are nothing but piles of bones
held together by their uniforms.

569
00:51:28,599 --> 00:51:30,846
They're dying of hunger,
not gunshots, Jack.

570
00:51:30,881 --> 00:51:33,093
The Nationalists
are starving their own army.

571
00:51:33,604 --> 00:51:35,706
What's the point of our being here?

572
00:51:35,741 --> 00:51:36,739
None.

573
00:51:36,774 --> 00:51:38,537
They are letting the Japs have Lingbao.

574
00:51:39,176 --> 00:51:41,440
I've been ordered to evacuate.

575
00:51:41,912 --> 00:51:44,648
Well my wounded
won't survive being moved.

576
00:51:44,683 --> 00:51:46,115
Take the ones that will.

577
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:52,188
Why are you taking off your uniform?

578
00:51:53,157 --> 00:51:55,057
I thought I'd stick
around a little longer..

579
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:58,694
prepare a little welcome for the Japs.

580
00:52:00,831 --> 00:52:02,059
Hurry.

581
00:52:03,634 --> 00:52:04,999
Send the most injured first.

582
00:52:14,378 --> 00:52:17,905
I'll make them as comfortable as I can.
You know that.

583
00:52:28,592 --> 00:52:29,559
Be careful.

584
00:52:36,233 --> 00:52:37,732
Leave right away.

585
00:52:37,767 --> 00:52:39,232
You get on this car.

586
00:52:41,772 --> 00:52:42,739
Jack!!

587
00:53:30,470 --> 00:53:31,459
Leave him.

588
00:53:32,005 --> 00:53:35,600
He's dying. Leave.

589
00:54:28,061 --> 00:54:29,153
George..

590
00:54:30,263 --> 00:54:31,423
My God. Chen!

591
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:34,567
Chen!

592
00:54:37,437 --> 00:54:38,927
Have you pissed yourself?

593
00:54:40,206 --> 00:54:41,673
Jesus. He's wet the bed!

594
00:54:45,712 --> 00:54:46,679
How is she?

595
00:54:48,848 --> 00:54:49,815
Exhausted.

596
00:54:50,316 --> 00:54:53,217
Lingbao. It was pretty bad.

597
00:54:54,054 --> 00:54:55,021
I was lucky.

598
00:54:56,856 --> 00:54:58,448
She got our before the worst.

599
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:02,521
Will the Japanese get this far?

600
00:55:03,897 --> 00:55:04,864
Maybe.

601
00:55:06,099 --> 00:55:07,066
Maybe not.

602
00:55:07,901 --> 00:55:10,369
The trouble is,
I've seen what happens when they do.

603
00:56:07,727 --> 00:56:08,694
Can we come in?

604
00:56:10,597 --> 00:56:11,757
Who's this?

605
00:56:13,166 --> 00:56:14,724
Oh. Hello, Ching.

606
00:56:15,401 --> 00:56:18,203
And this.. is Lao Si.

607
00:56:18,238 --> 00:56:20,707
I saw a wolf, but I didn't cry.

608
00:56:20,742 --> 00:56:22,299
Oh, my goodness.

609
00:56:24,844 --> 00:56:25,811
Coffee?

610
00:56:27,547 --> 00:56:29,215
And steamed bread, with honey.

611
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:30,182
Honey?

612
00:56:32,919 --> 00:56:34,113
Come on, Lao Si.

613
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:36,914
He'll have that bread off you,
if you as much as blink.

614
00:56:37,724 --> 00:56:40,625
His main objective
in life is greater rotundity.

615
00:56:44,831 --> 00:56:45,991
Is this all right with you?

616
00:56:47,467 --> 00:56:48,434
It's fine.

617
00:56:50,170 --> 00:56:51,137
Ching..

618
00:56:52,305 --> 00:56:53,272
'Bye, 'bye.

619
00:56:53,373 --> 00:56:54,340
'Bye, 'bye.

620
00:56:57,310 --> 00:56:58,277
Lee..

621
00:57:01,881 --> 00:57:03,212
Jack Chen is here.

622
00:57:03,616 --> 00:57:05,174
He's been sick for the last week.

623
00:57:15,995 --> 00:57:17,428
You're impossible, you know.

624
00:57:18,731 --> 00:57:20,392
I thought you were dead as dirt.

625
00:57:21,201 --> 00:57:22,634
It's malaria.

626
00:57:23,036 --> 00:57:25,800
He's had it for years. They all have it.

627
00:57:26,539 --> 00:57:28,769
He'll be on his feet in no time.

628
00:57:30,276 --> 00:57:32,378
They've put a price on
your head, you know.

629
00:57:32,413 --> 00:57:34,412
Oh yeah? How much?

630
00:57:34,447 --> 00:57:36,412
Ten thousand yuan.

631
00:57:37,450 --> 00:57:38,610
I say, Jack.

632
00:57:38,718 --> 00:57:40,948
That's about thirty bucks U.S., George.

633
00:57:41,855 --> 00:57:43,322
That hurts my feelings.

634
00:57:43,923 --> 00:57:45,220
It's a fortune around here.

635
00:57:58,738 --> 00:58:00,569
Six..

636
00:58:00,974 --> 00:58:04,637
Qi. Seven.

637
00:58:05,278 --> 00:58:06,245
Quiet

638
00:58:08,248 --> 00:58:09,806
We've got Nationalist visitors.

639
00:58:10,216 --> 00:58:11,478
Stall them if you can.

640
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:18,016
End of class. Quiet

641
00:58:23,897 --> 00:58:27,094
The Japanese are
advancing and are very close.

642
00:58:27,567 --> 00:58:29,831
If our Nationalist forces
withdraw from Xian..

643
00:58:30,370 --> 00:58:34,136
we'll get orders to take over
this entire estate for military use.

644
00:58:36,676 --> 00:58:40,077
Then may I conclude you
have not got the order yet.

645
00:58:42,782 --> 00:58:46,309
Well, gentlemen,
if that's all, you may leave now.

646
00:58:46,753 --> 00:58:48,687
I have many things to do.

647
00:58:59,899 --> 00:59:01,366
Oh, one more thing.

648
00:59:02,302 --> 00:59:03,701
Those labourers..

649
00:59:05,138 --> 00:59:06,901
We have no labourers here.

650
00:59:08,007 --> 00:59:09,099
Only children.

651
00:59:09,742 --> 00:59:10,731
- Children?

652
00:59:11,244 --> 00:59:12,506
- This is a school for orphans.

653
00:59:14,147 --> 00:59:15,114
Is this true?

654
00:59:15,715 --> 00:59:17,080
Are they boys?

655
00:59:17,850 --> 00:59:19,918
If they decide to call me a Communist,

656
00:59:19,953 --> 00:59:22,478
they'll close the school
and they'll conscript the children.

657
00:59:22,789 --> 00:59:23,778
Of course.

658
00:59:24,257 --> 00:59:26,657
And I'm afraid it will
only be a matter of days.

659
00:59:31,998 --> 00:59:33,192
Stay here.

660
00:59:37,136 --> 00:59:40,333
Get out of here!

661
00:59:41,908 --> 00:59:43,170
Go. Just go!

662
00:59:52,852 --> 00:59:54,487
What was all that about?

663
00:59:54,522 --> 00:59:55,586
Bandits.

664
00:59:55,621 --> 00:59:57,987
There's no-one to control them nowadays.

665
00:59:58,191 --> 01:00:02,061
They claim they have opium to sell,
but the packages are full of dirt.

666
01:00:02,096 --> 01:00:04,291
Maybe it would be
safer not to sell opium.

667
01:00:04,797 --> 01:00:05,855
Safe?

668
01:00:06,366 --> 01:00:07,333
Nothing is safe.

669
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:08,894
You neither.

670
01:00:09,369 --> 01:00:11,669
You have all those strong soldier boys.

671
01:00:11,704 --> 01:00:14,571
You are like a farmer with
too many fat, juicy sheep!

672
01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:25,416
1, 2, 1..

673
01:00:25,451 --> 01:00:27,976
Stop. Turn back

674
01:00:29,622 --> 01:00:31,681
So where do you propose we take them?

675
01:00:32,258 --> 01:00:33,452
Up the Silk Road.

676
01:00:34,594 --> 01:00:35,760
Through the mountains?

677
01:00:35,795 --> 01:00:39,663
With snow and children,
at ten thousand feet?

678
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:42,665
That's insane.

679
01:00:42,969 --> 01:00:46,166
Actually, I mean to take them further,
beyond Lanzhou.

680
01:00:48,107 --> 01:00:49,631
Have you ever heard of Shandan?

681
01:00:50,510 --> 01:00:52,442
Shandan's on the edge of the Gobi Desert.

682
01:00:52,477 --> 01:00:54,375
It's about seven hundred miles from here.

683
01:00:55,281 --> 01:00:57,078
Seven hundred miles.

684
01:00:57,717 --> 01:00:59,485
Hogg, there's probably nothing there.

685
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:02,181
Exactly. There's nothing there.

686
01:01:02,655 --> 01:01:04,350
Nothing anybody could possibly want.

687
01:01:04,590 --> 01:01:05,887
Somewhere they'll be safe.

688
01:01:08,661 --> 01:01:10,995
Chen will come with us
as far as the Yellow River.

689
01:01:11,030 --> 01:01:13,464
Then he'll turn off and
join his Communist pals in Yenan.

690
01:01:14,167 --> 01:01:15,284
What about you?

691
01:01:15,319 --> 01:01:16,367
What about me?

692
01:01:16,402 --> 01:01:17,902
Will you go with Jack,

693
01:01:17,937 --> 01:01:19,962
or will you stay with us
and head for Shandan?

694
01:01:21,174 --> 01:01:22,664
Is that what you're asking me?

695
01:01:23,743 --> 01:01:25,710
He's got fire in his belly, that one.

696
01:01:25,745 --> 01:01:28,181
I would like to take him with me
when I rejoin my unit.

697
01:01:28,216 --> 01:01:29,148
No.

698
01:01:30,049 --> 01:01:31,149
He's not a child.

699
01:01:31,184 --> 01:01:33,209
You're right. He's not.

700
01:01:33,719 --> 01:01:36,051
He hasn't been a child
for a very long time.

701
01:01:45,431 --> 01:01:49,731
I believe in each of you.

702
01:01:50,970 --> 01:01:54,098
You're the toughest people I've ever met.

703
01:01:54,974 --> 01:01:58,466
Heavens, you once
scared the life out of me.

704
01:02:05,051 --> 01:02:06,712
It's very hard to leave this place.

705
01:02:07,453 --> 01:02:08,477
I know that.

706
01:02:09,755 --> 01:02:13,213
But I want you to remember one thing.

707
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:16,993
You've done all this by yourselves.

708
01:02:18,865 --> 01:02:21,493
You can do it all again.

709
01:02:24,036 --> 01:02:28,302
You can do it anywhere.

710
01:02:57,470 --> 01:02:58,835
Wound dressings.

711
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:01,739
Captured from the Japanese.

712
01:03:02,608 --> 01:03:06,237
Each one of them contains a single,
sterile dressing,

713
01:03:06,546 --> 01:03:08,537
wrapped around a tablet of morphine.

714
01:03:08,948 --> 01:03:10,381
Handy, huh?

715
01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:13,885
No wounded for us. That's an order.

716
01:03:22,595 --> 01:03:24,995
No! No, I'll take that.

717
01:03:31,404 --> 01:03:33,895
As long as we have something
to trade we'll survive.

718
01:03:34,373 --> 01:03:36,107
Yes, I would say so.

719
01:03:36,142 --> 01:03:39,339
But, still, this is an
ambitious enterprise.

720
01:03:40,179 --> 01:03:42,511
You are a remarkable man, Mr. Hogg.

721
01:03:42,915 --> 01:03:45,281
I have greatly enjoyed
doing business with you.

722
01:03:53,426 --> 01:03:54,757
This is your custom?

723
01:03:55,027 --> 01:03:56,927
When we say goodbye to a great lady.

724
01:03:58,631 --> 01:04:00,121
Well, goodbye, Mr. Hogg.

725
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:01,924
And farewell.

726
01:04:11,744 --> 01:04:13,268
- Hang-Ger!
- Yes

727
01:04:14,380 --> 01:04:16,007
- Zuien-ze!
- Yes

728
01:04:16,782 --> 01:04:18,477
- Xiao Bang!
- Yes

729
01:04:19,819 --> 01:04:21,420
- Rou-Ding..
- Yes

730
01:04:21,455 --> 01:04:23,022
- Lao Tung..
- Yes

731
01:04:23,057 --> 01:04:24,512
Muriel!

732
01:04:26,259 --> 01:04:27,526
- Lao Da..
- Yes

733
01:04:27,561 --> 01:04:28,761
- Lao San..
- Yes

734
01:04:28,796 --> 01:04:30,311
- Lao Er..
- Yes

735
01:04:30,346 --> 01:04:31,827
- Lao Si?
- Yes

736
01:04:34,033 --> 01:04:35,466
Yu-Lin..

737
01:04:35,768 --> 01:04:37,099
- Shi-Kai..
- Yes

738
01:04:40,239 --> 01:04:41,706
Yu-Lin!!

739
01:04:58,691 --> 01:05:00,352
Oh, Yu-Lin..

740
01:05:12,038 --> 01:05:13,005
Yu-Lin?

741
01:05:14,173 --> 01:05:18,109
Yu-Lin. It's all right.

742
01:05:18,944 --> 01:05:22,937
We'll make a new garden.

743
01:05:25,584 --> 01:05:26,608
Yu-Lin?

744
01:05:29,522 --> 01:05:30,489
Yu-Lin..

745
01:05:40,032 --> 01:05:41,260
Oh, Ching..

746
01:06:20,272 --> 01:06:23,173
I thought he was happy. I really did.

747
01:06:23,409 --> 01:06:26,572
But we'll never know
what went on the last time he was happy.

748
01:06:27,146 --> 01:06:29,882
Maybe someone, his mother or father

749
01:06:29,917 --> 01:06:31,982
or sister or whoever, said:

750
01:06:32,017 --> 01:06:34,047
"Ching, we have to leave here."

751
01:06:35,254 --> 01:06:37,119
And then something happened.

752
01:06:37,957 --> 01:06:41,893
Something so awful
we can't even begin to imagine it.

753
01:06:44,196 --> 01:06:45,458
It doesn't go away.

754
01:06:46,699 --> 01:06:49,031
It never goes away, and I know that.

755
01:06:49,702 --> 01:06:51,135
But all of this

756
01:06:51,170 --> 01:06:53,468
Flowers and honey, and..

757
01:06:55,074 --> 01:06:56,371
I forgot.

758
01:06:58,377 --> 01:07:01,835
I'm sorry, Ching. I forgot.

759
01:07:10,823 --> 01:07:12,017
Be quiet..

760
01:07:17,897 --> 01:07:19,455
Come on, boys. Come on!

761
01:07:25,070 --> 01:07:28,039
Quiet, boys. That's it.

762
01:07:48,861 --> 01:07:51,764
If the wolf wakes you, don't be afraid.

763
01:07:51,799 --> 01:07:54,667
- Just tell him what I said.
- I know.

764
01:07:54,702 --> 01:07:56,567
I know. Let's go.

765
01:08:25,798 --> 01:08:27,322
Here.. I'll take him.

766
01:08:29,168 --> 01:08:32,569
Oh, come on, sleepy head. Sshhh..

767
01:08:34,740 --> 01:08:36,071
Did you give that to him?

768
01:08:36,375 --> 01:08:38,043
Let him keep it, George.

769
01:08:38,078 --> 01:08:39,374
It's who he is.

770
01:08:43,215 --> 01:08:44,181
Right there.

771
01:08:44,216 --> 01:08:46,418
Right there. At the village entrance

772
01:08:46,453 --> 01:08:47,578
Thank you

773
01:08:48,754 --> 01:08:51,857
There is an abandoned farmhouse
just the other side of the village.

774
01:08:51,892 --> 01:08:52,881
We can camp there.

775
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:57,627
Also, he swears he saw
a couple of Japanese only two days ago.

776
01:09:04,236 --> 01:09:06,372
Shi-Kai. Go and sleep now.

777
01:09:06,407 --> 01:09:07,498
I'll take over.

778
01:09:09,475 --> 01:09:10,840
Shi-Kai, did you hear me?

779
01:09:14,980 --> 01:09:15,947
They're there.

780
01:09:17,316 --> 01:09:18,749
I can smell them.

781
01:09:45,911 --> 01:09:47,742
Drop your guns!

782
01:09:48,047 --> 01:09:49,378
Drop your guns!

783
01:09:53,552 --> 01:09:55,315
Hands up

784
01:09:56,889 --> 01:09:57,878
Shi-Kai!

785
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:02,386
Shi-Kai! The door!

786
01:10:06,332 --> 01:10:07,933
We have to kill them, you know.

787
01:10:07,968 --> 01:10:08,966
No.

788
01:10:09,001 --> 01:10:10,336
Don't be stupid, George.

789
01:10:10,371 --> 01:10:11,702
They are scouts.

790
01:10:11,737 --> 01:10:14,069
If they get away,
they will rejoin their unit.

791
01:10:16,442 --> 01:10:17,625
I'll do it.

792
01:10:17,660 --> 01:10:18,808
I said no!

793
01:11:25,244 --> 01:11:26,302
Shi-Kai!

794
01:11:30,349 --> 01:11:33,113
Leave. Don't watch.

795
01:11:47,733 --> 01:11:51,362
When we reach the Silk Road,
I want you to leave us.

796
01:11:54,339 --> 01:11:55,306
Come on, boys!

797
01:11:57,443 --> 01:11:58,410
Keep moving!

798
01:11:59,745 --> 01:12:00,905
Give you.

799
01:12:22,501 --> 01:12:24,162
Keep up ahead.

800
01:12:25,838 --> 01:12:26,964
Why did you stop?

801
01:12:30,075 --> 01:12:31,201
It's okay.

802
01:12:37,015 --> 01:12:46,291
We're refugees.
We're taking them North to safety.

803
01:12:46,326 --> 01:12:47,588
Your papers?

804
01:12:50,229 --> 01:12:53,721
We have no papers.

805
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,194
Search their belongings.

806
01:13:12,050 --> 01:13:13,278
My God..

807
01:13:27,399 --> 01:13:28,696
Sir, look at this!

808
01:13:32,771 --> 01:13:34,329
A Corporal Kurahara.

809
01:13:35,841 --> 01:13:36,808
No!

810
01:13:37,910 --> 01:13:38,899
No!

811
01:13:39,945 --> 01:13:41,071
No!

812
01:13:42,414 --> 01:13:43,540
We found it.

813
01:13:44,483 --> 01:13:47,475
We found it on a dead soldier.

814
01:13:50,022 --> 01:13:51,546
He shouldn't have taken it.

815
01:13:55,027 --> 01:13:56,460
He's just a child.

816
01:13:58,597 --> 01:13:59,757
Where did you find it?

817
01:14:03,735 --> 01:14:05,396
Shi-Kai! No

818
01:14:07,773 --> 01:14:09,968
Shi-Kai! Put the gun down now!

819
01:14:14,713 --> 01:14:15,680
Quiet!

820
01:14:18,817 --> 01:14:20,045
Shi-Kai!!

821
01:14:21,587 --> 01:14:23,452
Shi-Kai! The wagon!

822
01:14:30,762 --> 01:14:32,024
Shi-Kai!

823
01:14:33,966 --> 01:14:34,933
Shi-Kai!

824
01:14:37,669 --> 01:14:39,102
Don't come over here.

825
01:14:46,845 --> 01:14:48,176
We're moving on.

826
01:15:23,482 --> 01:15:25,677
Lee, I thought you said
there was morphine in these.

827
01:15:29,454 --> 01:15:30,421
Lee!

828
01:15:34,860 --> 01:15:36,088
Lee! Where are you?

829
01:15:37,863 --> 01:15:38,887
I'm here.

830
01:15:39,197 --> 01:15:40,164
Hurry up!

831
01:15:49,141 --> 01:15:50,472
It's all that's left.

832
01:15:52,210 --> 01:15:53,177
What?

833
01:16:24,443 --> 01:16:25,603
He's sleeping?

834
01:16:30,849 --> 01:16:32,441
He won't wake up now.

835
01:16:33,618 --> 01:16:36,485
Sometime in the next
hour or two he'll die.

836
01:16:47,566 --> 01:16:49,193
Sleep, Shi-Kai.

837
01:16:51,069 --> 01:16:53,003
Everything's all right now.

838
01:16:53,538 --> 01:16:55,062
Go find them. Okay?

839
01:16:55,307 --> 01:16:57,002
Go find your family.

840
01:16:57,309 --> 01:17:00,710
Sleep.. Sleep..

841
01:18:16,655 --> 01:18:20,216
It's okay. Easy.. easy..

842
01:18:28,233 --> 01:18:30,633
You will be fine.

843
01:18:50,055 --> 01:18:52,524
You and I have
one thing in common, George

844
01:18:52,559 --> 01:18:54,458
- we are both from good families.

845
01:18:54,793 --> 01:18:57,159
We have the luxury of our ideals.

846
01:18:58,430 --> 01:19:02,298
Lee - she is the one who's different.

847
01:19:03,101 --> 01:19:05,036
It's never a matter of ideals to her.

848
01:19:05,071 --> 01:19:06,867
It's something deep in her gut.

849
01:19:07,939 --> 01:19:10,567
She can't look at
these people without feeling their pain.

850
01:19:11,376 --> 01:19:15,142
When it got too much,
she took opium do deal with her pain.

851
01:19:17,916 --> 01:19:19,816
Have you ever heard of the Bitter Sea?

852
01:19:22,687 --> 01:19:24,279
It's an old name for China.

853
01:19:25,357 --> 01:19:28,520
What we Chinese do best, is to endure.

854
01:19:29,694 --> 01:19:32,094
We try to keep our heads above water.

855
01:19:33,298 --> 01:19:34,287
That's all.

856
01:19:36,001 --> 01:19:38,401
While the bitter sea swirls around us,

857
01:19:39,804 --> 01:19:40,930
we endure.

858
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:45,207
But you know,
Lee's more Chinese than either of us.

859
01:19:46,444 --> 01:19:48,105
She doesn't believe in a future,

860
01:19:48,747 --> 01:19:50,237
because like the Chinese,

861
01:19:51,583 --> 01:19:53,710
she doesn't think she deserves one.

862
01:20:04,462 --> 01:20:07,329
George, you're
going to show her she does.

863
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:52,643
You thought I was such
a goddamn saint, didn't you, George?

864
01:20:54,746 --> 01:20:55,804
Well, now you know.

865
01:21:00,685 --> 01:21:01,674
Now you know.

866
01:21:09,494 --> 01:21:11,086
Well, you're certainly no lady.

867
01:21:13,265 --> 01:21:16,200
You're a brave, beautiful woman.

868
01:21:18,270 --> 01:21:21,671
You're the bravest,
most beautiful woman I've ever met.

869
01:22:31,242 --> 01:22:32,504
Tell her goodbye for me.

870
01:23:22,227 --> 01:23:23,319
That's the Yellow River.

871
01:23:24,396 --> 01:23:26,728
And just this side of it, Lanzhou.

872
01:23:29,367 --> 01:23:30,356
It is so big.

873
01:23:48,153 --> 01:23:49,177
Stop!

874
01:24:21,052 --> 01:24:23,816
Stop, you two follow me.

875
01:24:25,523 --> 01:24:26,785
Wait.

876
01:24:44,943 --> 01:24:47,673
I am the Magistrate of Lanzhou.

877
01:24:48,513 --> 01:24:50,708
This is Mr Chang Shengyi..

878
01:24:50,982 --> 01:24:52,347
the Chief of Police.

879
01:24:56,221 --> 01:24:59,657
You took more than 60 children..

880
01:25:00,291 --> 01:25:04,421
climbed over Liupan Mountain
and walked 500 miles.

881
01:25:05,230 --> 01:25:06,663
To get there?

882
01:25:07,932 --> 01:25:09,801
It's hard to believe.

883
01:25:09,836 --> 01:25:10,893
But it's true.

884
01:25:11,002 --> 01:25:12,604
How long did it take?

885
01:25:12,639 --> 01:25:13,730
Three months!

886
01:25:13,872 --> 01:25:15,032
Three months!

887
01:25:16,341 --> 01:25:20,334
You'll walk 200 miles more to Shandan?

888
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:21,501
Correct.

889
01:25:31,289 --> 01:25:33,814
I won't allow you walk to Shandan.

890
01:25:36,094 --> 01:25:37,584
It's out of the question.

891
01:25:39,797 --> 01:25:41,697
I have four Dodge trucks.

892
01:25:44,602 --> 01:25:46,001
You can borrow them.

893
01:25:48,773 --> 01:25:49,740
Thank you

894
01:26:32,383 --> 01:26:34,283
- What's happened?
- The truck is out of order.

895
01:26:47,498 --> 01:26:49,125
Hogg, do you see that?

896
01:26:49,767 --> 01:26:50,734
Hogg?

897
01:26:52,403 --> 01:26:53,461
Hogg!

898
01:27:26,938 --> 01:27:28,200
Is everybody all right?

899
01:27:38,850 --> 01:27:40,414
Hogg? Are you okay?

900
01:27:40,449 --> 01:27:41,978
Just a scratch.

901
01:27:46,257 --> 01:27:47,224
All right..

902
01:28:34,706 --> 01:28:37,800
My God, where have you
brought us? The 14th century?

903
01:28:58,963 --> 01:28:59,930
Look!

904
01:29:00,164 --> 01:29:02,064
There it is, beyond the watchtower.

905
01:29:03,167 --> 01:29:04,134
Shandan.

906
01:29:07,805 --> 01:29:13,368
Mr. Hogg, this way please.

907
01:29:17,982 --> 01:29:21,315
Mr. Hogg, please follow me.

908
01:29:55,153 --> 01:29:58,589
I was told to find a building for you.

909
01:30:06,030 --> 01:30:08,692
This is called
The Temple of King Ashoka's Hair.

910
01:30:09,100 --> 01:30:11,728
The monks left..
many years ago.

911
01:30:23,381 --> 01:30:25,178
Do you think it will do?

912
01:30:39,497 --> 01:30:42,193
Slower..

913
01:30:49,340 --> 01:30:51,638
This is wrong, should be like that.

914
01:30:55,780 --> 01:30:58,044
Hey. Quick.

915
01:31:01,986 --> 01:31:03,715
The light is on, good!

916
01:31:25,676 --> 01:31:26,665
Coffee?

917
01:31:34,085 --> 01:31:36,212
Where on earth did you find this?

918
01:31:36,787 --> 01:31:37,845
Surprise.

919
01:31:39,123 --> 01:31:42,456
I thought I'd lost it..
untouched the whole way.

920
01:31:44,328 --> 01:31:45,590
Celebration.

921
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:51,062
Are you all right?

922
01:31:51,702 --> 01:31:52,964
Flu, I think.

923
01:31:53,671 --> 01:31:54,660
Tired.

924
01:31:55,306 --> 01:31:58,673
Here. Drink this then
I'll take a look at you.

925
01:32:00,478 --> 01:32:01,809
Actually, I..

926
01:32:05,249 --> 01:32:06,216
Hogg!

927
01:32:08,019 --> 01:32:09,077
Hogg?

928
01:32:12,023 --> 01:32:15,793
Rou-Ding. They'll
have this in Lanzhou. Okay?

929
01:32:15,828 --> 01:32:16,959
We've run out of this.

930
01:32:16,994 --> 01:32:19,087
I know.. Ho-Ke has tetanus.

931
01:32:20,031 --> 01:32:22,333
Okay, hurry! Please hurry!

932
01:32:22,368 --> 01:32:23,630
Please! Hurry!

933
01:32:51,529 --> 01:32:52,962
Hurry, excuse me.

934
01:33:40,378 --> 01:33:41,367
Wait.

935
01:33:54,692 --> 01:33:56,319
Open the door!

936
01:34:07,138 --> 01:34:08,822
Lee? Lee?

937
01:34:08,857 --> 01:34:10,507
Yeah?

938
01:34:12,676 --> 01:34:14,238
I'm not scared.

939
01:34:14,273 --> 01:34:15,801
No, of course not.

940
01:34:16,680 --> 01:34:18,149
Rou-Ding's coming with serum.

941
01:34:18,184 --> 01:34:19,446
You're going to be fine.

942
01:34:20,451 --> 01:34:21,418
No.

943
01:34:22,987 --> 01:34:24,181
But it's all right.

944
01:34:26,357 --> 01:34:29,190
I don't like to be contradicted, Hogg.
You know that.

945
01:34:30,494 --> 01:34:33,088
I've been so lucky, Lee.

946
01:34:38,235 --> 01:34:40,066
I've been so lucky.

947
01:35:38,896 --> 01:35:45,631
SHI KAI

948
01:35:50,674 --> 01:35:51,800
Ching..

949
01:35:55,713 --> 01:35:57,476
CHING

950
01:36:21,272 --> 01:36:24,070
He came from a distant land..

951
01:36:24,775 --> 01:36:28,176
but his spirit wished
to stay here with us.

952
01:36:29,780 --> 01:36:32,374
Ho-Ke has not left us..

953
01:36:33,350 --> 01:36:38,049
because he gave himself to each of us..

954
01:36:39,056 --> 01:36:41,149
and whatever we do from now on..

955
01:36:42,493 --> 01:36:45,519
we will always be able..

956
01:36:46,330 --> 01:36:47,729
to hear his voice.

957
01:37:31,175 --> 01:37:32,301
Jack..

958
01:37:32,943 --> 01:37:35,138
Oh, Jack..

959
01:37:35,713 --> 01:37:37,408
I only found out a week ago.

960
01:37:38,082 --> 01:37:39,515
Somebody came from Lanzhou.

961
01:37:42,319 --> 01:37:43,718
I'm fine, Jack.

962
01:37:44,121 --> 01:37:45,088
We need you.

963
01:37:45,155 --> 01:37:46,255
The boys are safe now.

964
01:37:46,290 --> 01:37:47,621
They can manage on their own.

965
01:38:01,672 --> 01:38:04,470
Lee. I'm serious.

966
01:38:05,909 --> 01:38:08,036
Maybe these boys don't need me, Jack.

967
01:38:08,545 --> 01:38:09,773
But I need them.

968
01:38:11,315 --> 01:38:12,714
Oh yes, I do need them.

969
01:38:13,717 --> 01:38:17,087
I didn't pee the bed..
because I'm a big boy now.

970
01:38:17,122 --> 01:38:18,687
If the wolf comes..

971
01:38:18,722 --> 01:38:22,157
I'll say "go away stupid.."

972
01:38:22,192 --> 01:38:25,628
and he'll be frightened and run away.

973
01:38:32,002 --> 01:38:33,936
Ho-Ke says you can have that.

974
01:38:34,738 --> 01:38:36,797
I don't like coffee.

975
01:38:36,874 --> 01:38:39,365
Ho-Ke says you can have it.

976
01:38:43,681 --> 01:38:45,308
You're a brave boy, Lao Si.

977
01:38:47,251 --> 01:38:48,445
Brave boy.

978
01:39:28,559 --> 01:39:32,663
Many of George Hogg's
children are still alive,

979
01:39:32,698 --> 01:39:36,565
among them Lao Si and his three brothers.

980
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:39,262
The four of us could
never have survived without Hogg.

981
01:39:39,737 --> 01:39:40,795
That's certain.

982
01:39:44,842 --> 01:39:47,140
We brothers didn't know our birthdays.

983
01:39:47,878 --> 01:39:50,039
Even my older brother didn't know.

984
01:39:51,348 --> 01:39:55,546
When asked, we all say, "The 22nd"

985
01:39:56,520 --> 01:39:59,353
this was the day George Hogg died.

986
01:40:05,162 --> 01:40:06,595
Ho-Ke gave a speech.

987
01:40:06,997 --> 01:40:10,990
He wrote three words
on the blackboard, in English.

988
01:40:11,668 --> 01:40:16,401
Where do we want to go?
"Why" and "How".

989
01:40:17,307 --> 01:40:18,740
He had his methods.

990
01:40:19,476 --> 01:40:22,604
Then he explained
how far it was to Shandan

991
01:40:23,180 --> 01:40:25,910
over 1,000 kilometres.

992
01:40:26,683 --> 01:40:28,116
We would march there;

993
01:40:28,685 --> 01:40:33,213
our belongings packed on
hand carts and mule carriages.

994
01:40:39,129 --> 01:40:42,664
We kept hearing
that Shandan was so cold

995
01:40:42,699 --> 01:40:45,998
that your nose would
break off if you touched it.

996
01:40:46,537 --> 01:40:49,973
And when you pee,
it would become an ice stick.

997
01:40:51,341 --> 01:40:54,674
But Hogg assured us
it wouldn't be that bad.

998
01:40:58,649 --> 01:41:00,344
It was a very cold winter.

999
01:41:00,717 --> 01:41:04,755
And walking all the way
through snow and on icy roads.

1000
01:41:04,790 --> 01:41:06,655
It took us over two months.

1001
01:41:07,591 --> 01:41:09,725
Later people called this,

1002
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:12,092
'The Long March in Miniature.'

1003
01:41:18,535 --> 01:41:22,631
He was a perfect man.
Everybody has his flaws,

1004
01:41:23,140 --> 01:41:25,074
but I couldn't find any in Hogg.

1005
01:41:26,176 --> 01:41:28,940
He was always smiling when talking to us.

1006
01:41:29,880 --> 01:41:35,841
He knew, and he taught us
what to hate and what to love.

1007
01:41:43,227 --> 01:41:46,697
The Chinese people
remember those foreigners

1008
01:41:46,732 --> 01:41:49,359
who helped China during those struggles.

1009
01:41:52,736 --> 01:41:55,204
No matter how the world may change,

1010
01:41:56,773 --> 01:42:01,073
we, the Chinese, will never forget them.

1011
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:12,200
