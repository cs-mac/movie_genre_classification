00:00:04,449 --> 00:00:06,179
[Episode 20 End]

2
00:00:08,549 --> 00:00:12,068
Shin Young Il claims all the
evidence you submitted along with...

3
00:00:12,069 --> 00:00:14,648
the Jung Geun Moo list are fabricated.
What is your response?

4
00:00:14,649 --> 00:00:16,658
Jung Geun Moo's testimony...

5
00:00:16,659 --> 00:00:18,949
and the evidence I submitted
will be proven...

6
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,549
to be authentic and true after a
proper investigation and analysis.

7
00:00:22,979 --> 00:00:25,179
However, Shin Young Il...

8
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:27,419
must admit to his crimes...

9
00:00:28,149 --> 00:00:30,019
and withdraw from his position...

10
00:00:30,479 --> 00:00:33,018
if he has any decency as a human being.

11
00:00:33,019 --> 00:00:35,308
Why did Chairman Jung confess
to his son's crime...

12
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:37,079
and testify at the confirmation hearing?

13
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:39,038
You should ask him yourself.

14
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,349
But I'd like to thank him...

15
00:00:41,779 --> 00:00:43,349
from the bottom of my heart...

16
00:00:43,749 --> 00:00:46,519
for taking courage and testifying.
That is all.

17
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:49,248
- Wait a minute.
- One more question.

18
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:51,448
- Excuse me.
- Is that blood on you?

19
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:52,938
Please tell us where that came from!

20
00:00:52,939 --> 00:00:54,149
I got a nosebleed!

21
00:00:55,419 --> 00:00:57,928
Wow. That was straight out of a movie.

22
00:00:57,929 --> 00:00:59,968
How did you get Chairman
Jung to take the stand?

23
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:02,168
Where did you get those videos?

24
00:01:02,169 --> 00:01:03,958
What a blow.

25
00:01:03,959 --> 00:01:06,368
We were worried because we
couldn't reach you this morning.

26
00:01:06,369 --> 00:01:07,898
The Minister position is gone now, right?

27
00:01:07,899 --> 00:01:09,368
With all that evidence,

28
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:11,089
- he can't stand a chance.
- That's right.

29
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:12,658
There's one thing left.

30
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:14,019
Ae Ra, please call Detective Song.

31
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:20,489
Speak of the devil. Hi, Detective Song.

32
00:01:23,019 --> 00:01:24,179
Detective Song.

33
00:01:24,549 --> 00:01:26,019
What is it? What's up?

34
00:01:26,449 --> 00:01:29,179
Mr Joe Deul Ho called out
of the blue this morning.

35
00:01:30,219 --> 00:01:31,549
He asked me to catch a killer.

36
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,079
What?

37
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:36,549
So I went to Incheon
airport as Mr Joe asked,

38
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:38,149
and he came right in.

39
00:01:48,249 --> 00:01:49,349
Choi Hyun Tae?

40
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,519
Choi Hyun Tae.

41
00:01:57,919 --> 00:02:00,308
You are under arrest for the
murder of Kang Il Goo and...

42
00:02:00,309 --> 00:02:02,269
the attempted murder of Joe Deul Ho.
Take him in.

43
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:04,398
Wait.

44
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,508
I can't believe you went
all the way there...

45
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:07,819
just because Mr Joe told you to.

46
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:09,479
He's peculiar,

47
00:02:09,849 --> 00:02:11,598
but he doesn't lie.

48
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,488
He's never wrong.

49
00:02:13,489 --> 00:02:14,819
Did you get proof?

50
00:02:15,389 --> 00:02:16,579
It was all in here.

51
00:02:28,279 --> 00:02:29,749
He's here. He's here.

52
00:02:31,449 --> 00:02:34,849
Would you like to say something
about Joe Deul Ho's accusations?

53
00:02:35,449 --> 00:02:36,649
It is an insult to me.

54
00:02:37,049 --> 00:02:39,849
I have led a pure and transparent
career for 30 years.

55
00:02:40,419 --> 00:02:42,099
It is an attack on prosecutors as a whole.

56
00:02:42,449 --> 00:02:45,919
I will follow the law and make
sure he pays for his actions.

57
00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:49,298
What about the video that
Joe Deul Ho submitted?

58
00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:51,419
It was a fabrication made
with malicious intent.

59
00:02:52,179 --> 00:02:54,619
I will investigate thoroughly
and uncover the truth.

60
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:56,308
Sir.

61
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:57,979
Please answer one more question.

62
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:06,318
Get people to analyse the evidence
from the confirmation hearing.

63
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,558
Don't worry, Sir. We'll prove
that they were fabricated.

64
00:03:09,559 --> 00:03:11,879
You'll get past this. Stay strong, Sir.

65
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:25,519
(Minister)

66
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:28,108
Hello, Sir.

67
00:03:28,109 --> 00:03:29,758
This is a disgrace.

68
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:31,379
- What's going on?
- My apologies, Sir.

69
00:03:32,149 --> 00:03:33,468
I'll take care of it.

70
00:03:33,469 --> 00:03:36,179
I'm going to discuss what
to do with the general,

71
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,918
so you think of something as well.

72
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:41,119
I will. But Sir,

73
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:43,279
I need your help.

74
00:03:45,749 --> 00:03:46,779
Thank you.

75
00:03:56,119 --> 00:03:58,368
Was everything presented
at the hearing true?

76
00:03:58,369 --> 00:04:01,018
- Does it matter if they were true?
- Father!

77
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:02,819
Everything is about to collapse!

78
00:04:03,579 --> 00:04:04,888
We must stop it!

79
00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:06,358
A person has died.

80
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:08,018
How will you stop it this time?

81
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:11,558
I don't know whether I
can help you any more!

82
00:04:11,559 --> 00:04:12,719
Then stay out of it.

83
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:14,219
Yes!

84
00:04:14,649 --> 00:04:16,189
I will stay out of it from now on.

85
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:33,938
Joe Deul Ho, who appeared as a witness...

86
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:36,019
at Shin Young Il's confirmation hearing,

87
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,328
testified that Chairman Jung
Geun Moo of Daehwa Group...

88
00:04:40,329 --> 00:04:43,879
bribed Shin and requested that
he cover up his son's crime.

89
00:04:44,579 --> 00:04:47,579
Joe Deul Ho submitted incriminating
videos to back up his accusations.

90
00:04:48,049 --> 00:04:51,119
Congressman Kim, the presiding officer,

91
00:04:51,579 --> 00:04:55,419
said they would investigate
thoroughly to uncover the truth.

92
00:04:56,249 --> 00:04:59,408
The Shin Young Il, who
had been advocating...

93
00:04:59,409 --> 00:05:02,949
cleaning up corruption, may lose
his nomination for Minister.

94
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:13,379
Is this your office?

95
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,219
I was about to leave.

96
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:17,248
What will you do?

97
00:05:17,249 --> 00:05:18,719
If Shin Young Il crumbles,

98
00:05:19,049 --> 00:05:21,879
you'll be left with nothing and nobody.

99
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:23,749
You never know.

100
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:27,249
They say the evidence may
have been fabricated.

101
00:05:28,219 --> 00:05:29,428
Plus,

102
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:32,619
it's not like I'm affiliated with Mr Shin.

103
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:34,919
You're not?

104
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:37,898
I heard you went around telling
the partners at the firm...

105
00:05:37,899 --> 00:05:39,898
that since you're close
with the future minister,

106
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:42,619
you must become the managing
partner of Geum San.

107
00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:46,119
I was just saying that.

108
00:05:47,749 --> 00:05:50,679
Since Mr Jang was found guilty,

109
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:52,948
we'll have to get a new
managing partner anyway.

110
00:05:52,949 --> 00:05:55,419
You're his daughter,

111
00:05:56,819 --> 00:05:58,499
so it won't help restore the firm's image.

112
00:05:59,049 --> 00:06:00,049
So,

113
00:06:02,249 --> 00:06:05,119
I'll take good care of Geum San.

114
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:07,619
I'll say just one thing.

115
00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:13,379
Don't even think about
taking over Geum San.

116
00:06:14,219 --> 00:06:17,228
It's not a place that a kiss-up
who wags his tail at anyone...

117
00:06:17,229 --> 00:06:18,819
can dare even covet.

118
00:06:21,119 --> 00:06:23,519
And if you come into this office again,

119
00:06:24,149 --> 00:06:25,479
I won't let it go.

120
00:06:27,719 --> 00:06:28,719
Get out.

121
00:06:45,649 --> 00:06:47,019
You said you'd find a way,

122
00:06:47,579 --> 00:06:49,098
and you really did.

123
00:06:49,099 --> 00:06:51,119
I told you, I'm Superman.

124
00:06:53,649 --> 00:06:54,919
What? Kim Tae Jung?

125
00:06:56,379 --> 00:06:58,819
That bat. Don't mind him.

126
00:06:59,149 --> 00:07:01,979
Once we take care of Mr Shin,
he'll drop off on his own.

127
00:07:02,349 --> 00:07:03,949
Don't worry about him. It's really okay.

128
00:07:06,349 --> 00:07:08,618
Why did you say that at
the confirmation hearing?

129
00:07:08,619 --> 00:07:11,049
Do you want me to go to prison?
Do you want me to die?

130
00:07:12,149 --> 00:07:15,498
Father, please call the reporters
and hold a press conference.

131
00:07:15,499 --> 00:07:17,949
Tell them I never killed anyone.

132
00:07:19,149 --> 00:07:20,779
The chairman is not well.

133
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,258
He needs to rest, so please leave.

134
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:24,449
Why you...

135
00:07:25,049 --> 00:07:26,379
What's wrong with you?

136
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,249
He fell for Joe Deul Ho's
tricks and sold me out!

137
00:07:29,679 --> 00:07:31,119
What were you doing?

138
00:07:31,679 --> 00:07:34,049
Call the reporters. I'll
hold the press conference.

139
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:38,219
I'll say his mind wasn't all there
because of his brain surgery.

140
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:40,398
I'll tell them, so call the reporters.

141
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:41,749
I'm here. Happy?

142
00:07:42,219 --> 00:07:43,568
Joe Deul Ho, you jerk.

143
00:07:43,569 --> 00:07:46,249
- Do you want to do an interview?
- What did you say to my father?

144
00:07:47,549 --> 00:07:48,849
You must be crazy.

145
00:07:53,049 --> 00:07:54,298
Don't come closer.

146
00:07:54,299 --> 00:07:56,449
The first blow was what your father wanted.

147
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,679
The second was for the
people that you hurt.

148
00:08:00,049 --> 00:08:02,819
Do you know why I hit you?

149
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:04,458
I don't know anything.

150
00:08:04,459 --> 00:08:06,708
I'll need to hit you about 100 times.

151
00:08:06,709 --> 00:08:07,719
Get over here.

152
00:08:08,049 --> 00:08:11,628
For every question you can't answer,
it's an additional 30 punches.

153
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:13,149
- Get over here.
- I know.

154
00:08:13,779 --> 00:08:16,679
Do you know why your father told
of your crimes at the hearing?

155
00:08:18,049 --> 00:08:19,108
What do you know?

156
00:08:19,109 --> 00:08:20,949
- I know! I know!
- What do you know?

157
00:08:23,619 --> 00:08:24,679
Because you're his son.

158
00:08:25,619 --> 00:08:27,419
You may be a loser, but
you're still his son.

159
00:08:27,749 --> 00:08:29,028
That's why he wanted to get you out...

160
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:31,719
even if it meant he had
to bribe someone for it,

161
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:34,149
but you became more and more despicable.

162
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:38,019
That's why he realised that wasn't
the right way to love his child.

163
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:40,419
Should we ask him?

164
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:43,049
Am I right?

165
00:08:47,579 --> 00:08:49,119
He says I'm right. Come here.

166
00:08:49,949 --> 00:08:50,949
Come here.

167
00:08:52,379 --> 00:08:53,379
Turn yourself in.

168
00:08:54,049 --> 00:08:55,529
Turn yourself in and find redemption.

169
00:08:56,289 --> 00:08:57,728
If you keep running,

170
00:08:57,729 --> 00:09:00,719
your time in prison will only get longer.

171
00:09:01,579 --> 00:09:03,849
Forget it. You need to be
beat up more before you go.

172
00:09:04,749 --> 00:09:06,428
Get over here. Get over here.

173
00:09:06,429 --> 00:09:07,549
- Come here.
- No.

174
00:09:27,789 --> 00:09:28,789
Chairman Jung.

175
00:09:32,349 --> 00:09:33,819
We started off on the wrong foot...

176
00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:38,819
and fought the entire way here,

177
00:09:40,549 --> 00:09:41,989
but I hope you recover completely...

178
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:45,249
and let me see you scream again.

179
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:47,949
When you make your return,

180
00:09:49,249 --> 00:09:50,979
please become a respected businessman.

181
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:57,719
And please ask for forgiveness...

182
00:10:04,349 --> 00:10:05,679
from Il Goo.

183
00:10:11,049 --> 00:10:12,549
Thank you again...

184
00:10:15,049 --> 00:10:16,719
for being brave...

185
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:22,049
and testifying.

186
00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:20,418
Are you here?

187
00:11:20,419 --> 00:11:22,479
What are you doing? Why
aren't you here yet?

188
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:24,949
Hurry up!

189
00:11:28,049 --> 00:11:31,549
Michael Jung, you are under arrest
for the murder of Noh Gwang Soo.

190
00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:34,628
What do you mean?

191
00:11:34,629 --> 00:11:36,819
- Ji Wook.
- I told you not to call me that.

192
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,608
- Take him away.
- Wait!

193
00:11:38,609 --> 00:11:40,848
I have something to say. Wait!

194
00:11:40,849 --> 00:11:43,238
Mr Shin!

195
00:11:43,239 --> 00:11:44,419
Please!

196
00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:49,638
Chairman Jung Geun Moo's son,
Michael Jung, was arrested today...

197
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:52,498
for hitting Noh Gwang Soo
with his car and killing him,

198
00:11:52,499 --> 00:11:56,219
destroying the body and
obstructing justice.

199
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:02,249
(Choi Hyun Tae)

200
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:10,399
I told you to leave the country.
Why are you calling?

201
00:12:10,979 --> 00:12:12,459
Couldn't you do that one thing right?

202
00:12:13,979 --> 00:12:15,019
It's me,

203
00:12:16,549 --> 00:12:17,549
Joe Deul Ho.

204
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:35,619
Thank you.

205
00:12:37,749 --> 00:12:39,979
You left me another piece of evidence.

206
00:12:40,479 --> 00:12:41,819
The recording is great.

207
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:46,779
Choi Hyun Tae...

208
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:50,949
was arrested for attempted murder...

209
00:12:54,119 --> 00:12:55,779
along with the murder of Kang Il Goo.

210
00:12:59,319 --> 00:13:00,549
I wanted to ask you...

211
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:02,879
why you killed...

212
00:13:06,349 --> 00:13:07,679
Kang Il Goo.

213
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:12,049
Was that necessary?

214
00:13:15,819 --> 00:13:16,919
Tell me.

215
00:13:19,819 --> 00:13:20,919
Don't you feel sorry...

216
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:29,319
for Kang Il Goo?

217
00:13:31,479 --> 00:13:33,219
Please tell me.

218
00:13:34,419 --> 00:13:35,549
Did you want to kill me...

219
00:13:37,619 --> 00:13:39,649
and become the minister?

220
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:46,219
Was the appointment as Minister...

221
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:48,649
that important?

222
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:51,779
Didn't I tell you...

223
00:13:52,819 --> 00:13:54,949
that I considered you my big brother?

224
00:13:56,249 --> 00:13:57,249
But...

225
00:13:58,479 --> 00:13:59,649
you wanted to kill me...

226
00:14:00,479 --> 00:14:04,019
just for that piece of paper
with the appointment.

227
00:14:05,549 --> 00:14:06,819
Stop babbling and get out.

228
00:14:14,149 --> 00:14:15,149
(Play)

229
00:14:16,749 --> 00:14:18,549
I need you to kill someone
in a car accident.

230
00:14:19,619 --> 00:14:20,708
Yes, Sir.

231
00:14:20,709 --> 00:14:22,179
If it all goes well,

232
00:14:22,649 --> 00:14:24,918
I'll make sure you're not dragged into it.

233
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:25,949
Don't make any mistakes.

234
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:27,279
Yes, Sir.

235
00:14:32,379 --> 00:14:33,679
I took care of Joe Deul Ho.

236
00:14:34,579 --> 00:14:35,579
Good job.

237
00:14:36,349 --> 00:14:37,879
Leave the country for a while.

238
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:44,749
How untrustworthy were you?

239
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:47,719
Choi Hyun Tae...

240
00:14:48,849 --> 00:14:50,719
recorded your conversations as insurance.

241
00:14:53,249 --> 00:14:54,919
He already confessed to the police.

242
00:14:58,019 --> 00:14:59,679
I told you, didn't I?

243
00:15:00,749 --> 00:15:01,779
Submit yourself...

244
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:03,919
to the judgment of the law.

245
00:15:36,249 --> 00:15:37,249
Ji Wook.

246
00:15:37,819 --> 00:15:39,788
You say you detest crimes,

247
00:15:39,789 --> 00:15:42,219
so I have no choice but to
cheer on that conviction.

248
00:15:42,819 --> 00:15:43,819
I hope...

249
00:15:44,549 --> 00:15:47,149
that conviction will be fair to everyone.

250
00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:50,179
Even if it is your own father.

251
00:15:52,349 --> 00:15:53,349
Come in.

252
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:08,769
This is everything Mr Joe submitted
during the confirmation hearing.

253
00:16:08,949 --> 00:16:12,408
The audio files of Mr Shin
ordering the murders...

254
00:16:12,409 --> 00:16:15,249
of Mr Joe and Kang Il
Goo are also in there.

255
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:21,449
He told me to tell you that what
you use this for is up to you.

256
00:16:21,849 --> 00:16:24,130
You can either expose or bury
Mr Shin's crimes with this.

257
00:16:25,619 --> 00:16:26,749
Is that what Deul Ho said?

258
00:16:28,719 --> 00:16:29,719
He wants me...

259
00:16:32,379 --> 00:16:33,749
to prosecute my own father?

260
00:16:35,949 --> 00:16:38,349
Rather than another prosecutor
putting the handcuffs on him,

261
00:16:41,549 --> 00:16:43,219
wouldn't you doing it...

262
00:16:44,149 --> 00:16:46,619
protect his pride just a little bit?

263
00:16:48,749 --> 00:16:51,179
That's what Mr Joe said.

264
00:16:57,849 --> 00:17:00,049
Thank goodness it wasn't worse.

265
00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:03,388
You are incredible.

266
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:07,028
You wore a sack of sand knowing
it was going to happen.

267
00:17:07,029 --> 00:17:08,619
That kept me alive,

268
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:12,649
but it was so heavy that I almost drowned.

269
00:17:13,749 --> 00:17:16,119
I don't know whether to laugh or not.

270
00:17:16,989 --> 00:17:20,478
How long will you risk your
life for your job like that?

271
00:17:20,479 --> 00:17:22,248
What if something bad happens?

272
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:24,249
You don't have nine lives, you know.

273
00:17:26,019 --> 00:17:27,019
Dae Soo.

274
00:17:27,719 --> 00:17:28,779
Can you believe...

275
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:31,319
Mr Shin tried to kill me?

276
00:17:31,779 --> 00:17:33,738
He's completely lost his mind...

277
00:17:33,739 --> 00:17:36,319
because of that minister position.

278
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:38,628
Even so,

279
00:17:38,629 --> 00:17:40,219
how could he go so far?

280
00:17:40,579 --> 00:17:44,558
When people lose their minds,
they can't think straight.

281
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,938
There were times when people I trusted...

282
00:17:46,939 --> 00:17:50,049
took off with my money, and
I wanted to kill them.

283
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:52,749
But you didn't kill them.

284
00:17:54,049 --> 00:17:58,628
The only explanation is that
he completely lost his mind.

285
00:17:58,629 --> 00:18:01,758
That's why we need to do whatever
it takes to lock him up.

286
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:04,028
Who knows what he'll do next?

287
00:18:04,029 --> 00:18:05,319
I'll have to stop him.

288
00:18:06,149 --> 00:18:07,489
I'll have to stop him.

289
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:09,519
I'll stop him.

290
00:18:17,049 --> 00:18:18,249
Let's drink together.

291
00:18:21,779 --> 00:18:23,349
How did you find me?

292
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:26,228
Did Deul Ho send you?

293
00:18:26,229 --> 00:18:27,249
No.

294
00:18:27,849 --> 00:18:29,619
I came on my own.

295
00:18:30,749 --> 00:18:34,049
I never properly thanked you
for finding my bag last time.

296
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:37,519
So I thought I'd buy drinks.

297
00:18:45,489 --> 00:18:46,749
If it were you,

298
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:49,489
could you...

299
00:18:50,649 --> 00:18:51,919
prosecute your own father?

300
00:18:53,379 --> 00:18:54,619
It wouldn't be easy.

301
00:18:55,049 --> 00:18:56,179
No matter what anyone says,

302
00:18:56,679 --> 00:18:57,819
my father...

303
00:18:58,719 --> 00:19:00,828
led a straight life as a good prosecutor.

304
00:19:00,829 --> 00:19:02,149
I became a prosecutor...

305
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:03,949
to be like him.

306
00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:06,179
But...

307
00:19:06,849 --> 00:19:08,489
it stopped at some point.

308
00:19:10,419 --> 00:19:12,619
He was no longer the father that I knew.

309
00:19:13,749 --> 00:19:17,579
It'll be hard to stand
by his side right now.

310
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:20,519
But if you do stay by his side,

311
00:19:21,219 --> 00:19:26,249
maybe he'll come back to being
the father that you respected.

312
00:19:28,749 --> 00:19:31,549
I think it's something that
only you, his son, can do.

313
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,619
Why am I saying this...

314
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:39,679
to you?

315
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:42,249
You don't have friends, do you?

316
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:45,168
I heard you were too busy
studying in school...

317
00:19:45,169 --> 00:19:47,818
and catching criminals as a prosecutor.

318
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:50,208
I also heard that you never
had a real girlfriend.

319
00:19:50,209 --> 00:19:51,548
Who said that?

320
00:19:51,549 --> 00:19:52,879
Mr Joe.

321
00:19:53,219 --> 00:19:54,419
Let's stop talking about this.

322
00:19:55,989 --> 00:19:57,119
You asked...

323
00:19:58,719 --> 00:20:01,749
if I could prosecute my own father, right?

324
00:20:04,749 --> 00:20:05,819
No.

325
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:08,219
I couldn't do it.

326
00:20:10,179 --> 00:20:12,419
But you can do it.

327
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:16,919
That is what I think.

328
00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:39,819
Did you want to kill me...

329
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:43,249
and become the minister?

330
00:20:43,649 --> 00:20:45,158
Are you that short on money...

331
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:46,718
in becoming the minister?

332
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:48,498
You act calm on the outside,

333
00:20:48,499 --> 00:20:51,179
but you seem to be losing it on the inside.

334
00:20:52,449 --> 00:20:53,989
Lawyers defend,

335
00:20:54,619 --> 00:20:56,749
and prosecutors investigate.

336
00:20:59,749 --> 00:21:01,248
I took the GED...

337
00:21:01,249 --> 00:21:03,858
and have no money or connections,
so no one will eat with me.

338
00:21:03,859 --> 00:21:06,849
Shall I make you someone
with money and connections?

339
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,679
It's more honourable than you,

340
00:21:10,449 --> 00:21:12,489
who follows Chairman
Jung like a puppy dog...

341
00:21:13,049 --> 00:21:14,219
and cleans up after him.

342
00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:16,319
Left!

343
00:21:18,049 --> 00:21:19,049
Hello, Sir.

344
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:20,988
Did you go with the police again?

345
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:22,619
We uprooted them completely this time.

346
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:25,419
Why didn't you just become a detective?

347
00:21:26,049 --> 00:21:27,219
I should've, right?

348
00:21:27,549 --> 00:21:29,589
Why don't you go with me
next time if you are free?

349
00:21:29,949 --> 00:21:30,989
Good work.

350
00:21:33,719 --> 00:21:34,949
Didn't I tell you...

351
00:21:38,379 --> 00:21:40,649
that I considered you my big brother?

352
00:21:55,749 --> 00:21:58,219
Did you want to become Minister that badly?

353
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:04,419
Did you want to climb that high that badly?

354
00:22:07,819 --> 00:22:10,419
Why didn't you know that those that fall...

355
00:22:11,749 --> 00:22:13,219
don't have wings?

356
00:22:23,049 --> 00:22:24,049
As of today,

357
00:22:24,879 --> 00:22:25,879
I will...

358
00:22:27,049 --> 00:22:30,019
withdraw as a candidate for Minister.

359
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:33,879
Whereas a nominee for Minister must be...

360
00:22:35,349 --> 00:22:37,319
cleaner than anyone else,

361
00:22:37,719 --> 00:22:40,649
I am accused of corruption,
and thus am not qualified.

362
00:22:40,979 --> 00:22:42,749
Hence, I've decided to withdraw.

363
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,019
I apologise sincerely...

364
00:22:45,549 --> 00:22:48,419
to the people of this great nation.

365
00:22:49,749 --> 00:22:51,118
I promise...

366
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:55,049
to undergo a thorough
investigation of the charges...

367
00:22:56,119 --> 00:22:57,249
made against me.

368
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:05,819
Shin Young Il, the minister nominee,
has withdrawn his candidacy.

369
00:23:06,349 --> 00:23:09,349
He held a press conference and
went to the prosecutor's office.

370
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,179
He is expected to be investigated
for the claims made against him.

371
00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:19,979
Chief Justice Choi Dong Wook has
been nominated as the next minister.

372
00:23:20,379 --> 00:23:22,868
The public's attention is on how far...

373
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:25,779
Shin Young Il's corruption charges go.

374
00:23:29,579 --> 00:23:31,779
Gosh. Nothing lasts forever.

375
00:23:32,249 --> 00:23:35,398
He looked omnipotent, but he's gone.
Just like that.

376
00:23:35,399 --> 00:23:37,419
I don't know how to feel.

377
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:40,408
Come to think of it, you
started empty-handed...

378
00:23:40,409 --> 00:23:42,808
- but took them all down.
- That's right.

379
00:23:42,809 --> 00:23:45,008
And we added just a little bit...

380
00:23:45,009 --> 00:23:46,779
- and helped, right?
- A little.

381
00:23:47,149 --> 00:23:48,488
Thanks.

382
00:23:48,489 --> 00:23:50,679
Thank you. Thank you.

383
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,819
Okay, it's time to go back to
being the neighbourhood lawyer.

384
00:23:55,719 --> 00:23:57,968
That way, I can pay rent.

385
00:23:57,969 --> 00:23:59,618
I'm glad you brought that up.

386
00:23:59,619 --> 00:24:01,108
While we're on the topic,

387
00:24:01,109 --> 00:24:03,828
can you raise the rent just a little bit?

388
00:24:03,829 --> 00:24:07,318
Now that I've lowered my interest
rate, it's hard to pay the bills.

389
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:09,798
What are you talking about?

390
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:13,708
You can bring that up next year.
I'm busy right now.

391
00:24:13,709 --> 00:24:16,608
What? What did you just say?
Don't be like that.

392
00:24:16,609 --> 00:24:18,368
- Just a little bit.
- I'm busy.

393
00:24:18,369 --> 00:24:20,598
We won't be able to afford instant noodles.

394
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:22,249
Poor Dae Soo.

395
00:24:24,579 --> 00:24:26,449
Will we finally have peace?

396
00:24:26,879 --> 00:24:29,049
I think there will be some aftershocks.

397
00:24:29,819 --> 00:24:31,298
What will happen to Geum San?

398
00:24:31,299 --> 00:24:33,138
- What do you think?
- I think...

399
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:34,668
I'm sure they'll take a hit.

400
00:24:34,669 --> 00:24:37,008
Chairman Jung and Mr Shin
are all getting locked up.

401
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:39,149
Even their managing partner was locked up.

402
00:24:42,449 --> 00:24:43,519
Come in.

403
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:53,638
What is it?

404
00:24:53,639 --> 00:24:55,679
We had been misinformed.

405
00:24:57,249 --> 00:24:58,828
What do you mean?

406
00:24:58,829 --> 00:25:00,868
We didn't know Shin Young Il was like that.

407
00:25:00,869 --> 00:25:02,349
We were fooled...

408
00:25:02,879 --> 00:25:03,919
by Kim Tae Jung.

409
00:25:04,779 --> 00:25:07,768
When Kim Tae Jung went around
saying he was close to Mr Shin,

410
00:25:07,769 --> 00:25:09,448
you were all on his side.

411
00:25:09,449 --> 00:25:11,588
Now that Mr Shin has taken a fall,

412
00:25:11,589 --> 00:25:14,949
you want to come back to me, is that it?

413
00:25:15,619 --> 00:25:16,949
That's not it.

414
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,188
We agree with you.

415
00:25:19,189 --> 00:25:21,549
We think Geum San must
change in order to survive.

416
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:30,279
Mr Park. Mr Choi. Let's talk.

417
00:25:36,379 --> 00:25:37,879
I was instructed...

418
00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:41,249
to finish your investigation
during my term.

419
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:45,298
Wouldn't it be best for all...

420
00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:48,249
to bury what must be buried and
admit what must be admitted?

421
00:25:48,649 --> 00:25:50,219
There's no need to bury anything.

422
00:25:52,249 --> 00:25:53,649
If you're going to admit it anyway,

423
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:56,448
you must not leave any doubt.

424
00:25:56,449 --> 00:25:59,679
If it looks like you are going easy on me,

425
00:26:00,719 --> 00:26:03,179
it will not help you become...

426
00:26:03,949 --> 00:26:05,298
the Minister of Justice.

427
00:26:05,299 --> 00:26:06,949
Why did you have to...

428
00:26:07,349 --> 00:26:09,279
I've served you for so long.

429
00:26:09,979 --> 00:26:11,949
I can't become a stumbling block.

430
00:26:13,219 --> 00:26:15,619
Please let me be investigated fairly.

431
00:26:18,249 --> 00:26:19,449
Fine.

432
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:20,919
But...

433
00:26:21,949 --> 00:26:23,549
I have a favour to ask.

434
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:25,519
Go ahead.

435
00:26:26,219 --> 00:26:28,349
Please let Shin Ji Wook handle...

436
00:26:29,049 --> 00:26:31,479
all investigations and trials for my case.

437
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,949
Do you mean your son?

438
00:26:34,419 --> 00:26:35,819
Please, Sir.

439
00:26:36,249 --> 00:26:38,049
It won't look good.

440
00:26:38,849 --> 00:26:42,398
How can a son be impartial in
investigating his own father?

441
00:26:42,399 --> 00:26:44,649
He is capable of following the rules.

442
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:47,149
Even still,

443
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:50,818
it's not like he'd investigate
you just because I tell him to.

444
00:26:50,819 --> 00:26:52,019
He'll do it.

445
00:26:52,879 --> 00:26:53,949
Please permit it.

446
00:26:55,549 --> 00:26:56,549
Yes.

447
00:26:57,779 --> 00:26:58,819
I understand.

448
00:27:00,249 --> 00:27:03,319
I'll take on the case. Yes.

449
00:27:25,379 --> 00:27:27,579
I'm sure it'll be tough,
but we're counting on you.

450
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:31,679
No.

451
00:27:32,449 --> 00:27:33,619
I'll go in alone.

452
00:27:39,549 --> 00:27:41,749
(Chief Prosecutor, Shin Young Il)

453
00:27:44,149 --> 00:27:45,149
Come in.

454
00:27:56,979 --> 00:27:58,019
I came to escort you.

455
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:00,849
Okay. Let's go.

456
00:28:13,049 --> 00:28:16,949
(Shin Young Il, Chief Prosecutor)

457
00:29:05,049 --> 00:29:06,479
Do you need anything?

458
00:29:06,949 --> 00:29:07,949
No.

459
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:10,179
I'm a bit tired, but I'm fine.

460
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:12,519
You should call a lawyer.

461
00:29:13,049 --> 00:29:14,049
Later.

462
00:29:14,779 --> 00:29:16,319
I'm fine by myself for now.

463
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:18,819
The evidence is solid,

464
00:29:19,649 --> 00:29:21,369
so you won't be able to avoid serving time.

465
00:29:22,249 --> 00:29:23,679
If I had planned to bury it,

466
00:29:24,019 --> 00:29:25,249
I wouldn't have asked for you.

467
00:29:25,819 --> 00:29:28,088
Dig as much as you want.

468
00:29:28,089 --> 00:29:30,379
Don't let people say you
went easy on your father.

469
00:29:31,379 --> 00:29:32,379
That...

470
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:34,779
won't happen.

471
00:29:35,549 --> 00:29:36,549
Good.

472
00:29:40,549 --> 00:29:42,189
Let's begin with the most recent matters.

473
00:29:42,919 --> 00:29:44,049
On April 6, 2016,

474
00:29:45,579 --> 00:29:47,219
Jung Geun Moo...

475
00:29:53,179 --> 00:29:54,179
Father,

476
00:29:55,819 --> 00:29:56,879
why did you do it?

477
00:29:57,949 --> 00:29:59,049
Why?

478
00:29:59,379 --> 00:30:01,519
Why did you go so far?

479
00:30:02,419 --> 00:30:04,949
I believed that was the
way to protect myself...

480
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:07,298
and our organisation.

481
00:30:07,299 --> 00:30:08,319
Father!

482
00:30:08,819 --> 00:30:09,849
Power is...

483
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:13,649
difficult to let go of
once it's in your hands.

484
00:30:15,349 --> 00:30:18,319
The higher you climb, the
higher you want to climb.

485
00:30:18,719 --> 00:30:21,679
Did you have to climb high
even if it meant doing that?

486
00:30:22,619 --> 00:30:25,679
You could've made it
even without doing that.

487
00:30:26,979 --> 00:30:27,979
Really?

488
00:30:29,179 --> 00:30:30,219
I wonder.

489
00:30:32,379 --> 00:30:33,379
Life...

490
00:30:34,349 --> 00:30:35,819
isn't that easy.

491
00:30:42,749 --> 00:30:43,749
Ji Wook.

492
00:30:44,879 --> 00:30:46,149
Step on me to climb up.

493
00:30:47,849 --> 00:30:49,349
It may hurt you,

494
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:51,419
being the son of a corrupt prosecutor.

495
00:30:52,149 --> 00:30:53,149
However,

496
00:30:53,649 --> 00:30:55,689
if you're a prosecutor who
locked up such a father,

497
00:30:56,449 --> 00:31:00,658
you'll make people trust you
to be impartial with any case.

498
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:02,079
- Father.
- So,

499
00:31:02,449 --> 00:31:04,249
work your way to become
the chief prosecutor,

500
00:31:04,949 --> 00:31:05,979
the minister...

501
00:31:07,249 --> 00:31:08,419
and the general.

502
00:31:11,979 --> 00:31:14,919
I will be your cornerstone.

503
00:31:16,379 --> 00:31:19,049
That's why I asked for you.

504
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:27,049
Okay. Let's begin.

505
00:31:49,849 --> 00:31:52,908
Shin Young Il, the past chief
prosecutor, is being investigated...

506
00:31:52,909 --> 00:31:55,349
for inciting murder, taking
bribes and abusing his power.

507
00:31:57,319 --> 00:32:01,618
Shin Young Il is said to have
voluntarily confessed to the crimes.

508
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:04,248
People wonder why he incited the murders...

509
00:32:04,249 --> 00:32:06,808
and just how much he received in bribes...

510
00:32:06,809 --> 00:32:09,038
from Chairman Jung Geun
Moo of Daehwa Group.

511
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:10,558
(Shin Young Il Is Sentenced to Prison.)

512
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,838
The imprisonment of the
past chief prosecutor,

513
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:15,038
who had represented the prosecutors,

514
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:16,658
has left everyone wondering...

515
00:32:16,659 --> 00:32:19,419
how harmoniously the court and
prosecutors will work together.

516
00:32:21,149 --> 00:32:24,768
Shin Ji Wook, the prosecutor who
initiated this investigation,

517
00:32:24,769 --> 00:32:27,338
is Shin Young Il's son.

518
00:32:27,339 --> 00:32:29,019
This has caused a stir.

519
00:32:29,879 --> 00:32:32,038
The suspicions regarding
Shin Young Il's corruption,

520
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:34,038
which was brought to
light by Joe Deul Ho...

521
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:36,358
during Shin Young Il's
confirmation hearing,

522
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:39,179
will hopefully be clarified at trial.

523
00:32:42,049 --> 00:32:43,449
It's finally over.

524
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:47,449
Do you feel relieved?

525
00:32:49,049 --> 00:32:50,049
I'm not sure.

526
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,419
It'll be tough for Shin Ji Wook.

527
00:32:57,219 --> 00:32:58,219
I'm sure.

528
00:33:07,349 --> 00:33:09,349
(Law Firm Geum San)

529
00:33:10,419 --> 00:33:12,679
The partners have come to
a unanimous decision...

530
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,238
to elect Jang Hae Kyung...

531
00:33:15,239 --> 00:33:18,549
as the new managing partner of Geum San.

532
00:33:27,549 --> 00:33:28,549
Thank you.

533
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,128
Geum San will no longer be...

534
00:33:31,129 --> 00:33:34,019
a law firm which speaks only
for large corporations,

535
00:33:34,349 --> 00:33:37,319
but a firm that takes the side of
the weak, who need legal services.

536
00:33:37,779 --> 00:33:41,819
We must become a law firm
loved by the people.

537
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:43,349
I also believe...

538
00:33:43,719 --> 00:33:46,718
you should become people of
the law who value ethics...

539
00:33:46,719 --> 00:33:48,688
and be reborn as such.

540

(Managing Partner, Jang Hae Kyung)

541
00:34:01,249 --> 00:34:02,249
I...

542
00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:03,679
Ma'am.

543
00:34:04,219 --> 00:34:05,449
I'm sorry for everything.

544
00:34:06,349 --> 00:34:07,779
Geum San will change.

545
00:34:08,649 --> 00:34:09,649
So,

546
00:34:10,749 --> 00:34:12,419
you'll need to help.

547
00:34:15,949 --> 00:34:17,958
I'll work hard with a new heart.

548
00:34:17,959 --> 00:34:20,519
Ask anything. I'll do my best.

549
00:34:22,049 --> 00:34:23,049
Please,

550
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:29,649
leave Geum San.

551
00:34:31,479 --> 00:34:32,479
What was that?

552
00:34:36,749 --> 00:34:38,179
Are you kicking me out?

553
00:34:38,749 --> 00:34:41,438
I played a part in making
Geum San what it is today.

554
00:34:41,439 --> 00:34:42,908
Do you think I'll leave voluntarily?

555
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:44,509
I'm not asking you to leave voluntarily.

556
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:45,979
Kim Tae Jung,

557
00:34:46,419 --> 00:34:47,419
you're fired.

558
00:34:49,779 --> 00:34:50,779
Ma'am.

559
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:53,679
You want to fire people
at your whim, is that it?

560
00:34:54,349 --> 00:34:55,979
This is a violation of the labour law!

561
00:34:58,419 --> 00:35:00,519
Labour law? Give me a break.

562
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:03,878
It's natural that she
fire a criminal like you.

563
00:35:03,879 --> 00:35:05,949
Watch your mouth! What
do you mean, a criminal?

564
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:07,719
Kim Tae Jung.

565
00:35:08,619 --> 00:35:10,249
I have a gift for you.

566
00:35:11,649 --> 00:35:13,149
Gosh.

567
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:16,179
Do you remember this?

568
00:35:17,419 --> 00:35:20,248
The USB drive that you hired
someone to steal from my office.

569
00:35:20,249 --> 00:35:21,949
I suffered quite a bit because of this.

570
00:35:31,019 --> 00:35:32,549
I don't know what that is.

571
00:35:32,919 --> 00:35:34,149
I saw you pay...

572
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,119
your supposed friend for that.

573
00:35:47,319 --> 00:35:48,389
We have a witness, too.

574
00:35:49,219 --> 00:35:50,948
Inciting burglary.

575
00:35:50,949 --> 00:35:53,389
Money-laundering Daehwa Group's
slush fund is an added bonus.

576
00:35:53,919 --> 00:35:55,799
Is that sufficient grounds
for termination now?

577
00:35:58,579 --> 00:36:00,419
I've made plenty of copies,

578
00:36:01,049 --> 00:36:02,319
so don't get any stupid ideas.

579
00:36:19,279 --> 00:36:21,219
Why are you giving that
to me behind your back?

580
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:23,918
I wanted...

581
00:36:23,919 --> 00:36:25,679
to get you cookies or something,

582
00:36:26,179 --> 00:36:27,819
but she said I needed to bring you these.

583
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,568
Congratulations on becoming
the managing partner.

584
00:36:35,569 --> 00:36:36,579
It suits you.

585
00:36:37,479 --> 00:36:38,479
Thanks.

586
00:36:38,919 --> 00:36:40,768
Enjoy your time together.

587
00:36:40,769 --> 00:36:41,938
I'll leave you two alone.

588
00:36:41,939 --> 00:36:43,719
And congratulations.

589
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:45,649
Where are you going?

590
00:36:48,549 --> 00:36:50,549
You can't even eat that.

591
00:36:53,219 --> 00:36:54,219
Thanks.

592
00:36:56,579 --> 00:36:57,979
If it weren't for you,

593
00:36:59,149 --> 00:37:00,179
I never could've done it.

594
00:37:02,349 --> 00:37:04,979
Your name was outside on your door.

595
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:06,519
It looked good.

596
00:37:08,749 --> 00:37:10,179
I'm going to visit my dad.

597
00:37:10,649 --> 00:37:11,649
Will you come with me?

598
00:37:13,149 --> 00:37:14,149
Sure.

599
00:37:40,819 --> 00:37:43,119
How is your health? Are you doing okay?

600
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:44,749
Yes.

601
00:37:45,579 --> 00:37:47,858
Since I no longer drink
and exercise regularly,

602
00:37:47,859 --> 00:37:49,418
I've been well.

603
00:37:49,419 --> 00:37:50,549
I'm glad to hear that.

604
00:37:52,579 --> 00:37:53,749
Hae Kyung...

605
00:37:54,979 --> 00:37:57,219
was appointed as the managing
partner at Geum San today.

606
00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:01,949
Congratulations, Ms Jang.

607
00:38:04,049 --> 00:38:05,319
Hae Kyung plans...

608
00:38:06,389 --> 00:38:08,319
to change Geum San from now on.

609
00:38:09,619 --> 00:38:12,679
That is up to Ms Jang.

610
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:16,049
And Mr Shin...

611
00:38:16,889 --> 00:38:18,219
has been arrested.

612
00:38:20,349 --> 00:38:21,479
I heard about that.

613
00:38:25,049 --> 00:38:26,519
Please take a good care of...

614
00:38:27,619 --> 00:38:29,019
Hae Kyung.

615
00:38:30,019 --> 00:38:31,179
Don't worry, Sir.

616
00:38:31,889 --> 00:38:33,579
If you're planning to get back together,

617
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:36,389
do so while I'm in here.

618
00:38:37,319 --> 00:38:39,279
I may not approve of it once I'm out.

619
00:38:44,619 --> 00:38:45,679
There's no need.

620
00:38:47,649 --> 00:38:50,349
We'd like to stay as friends as we are now.

621
00:38:55,649 --> 00:38:58,249
I feel like fighting against
loneliness with a glass of alcohol.

622
00:38:58,719 --> 00:39:02,049
- Ta-da!
- What is it?

623
00:39:02,649 --> 00:39:06,008
You need to put this on your face.

624
00:39:06,009 --> 00:39:07,949
There's plenty of serum on this face mask.

625
00:39:09,419 --> 00:39:11,679
You need to keep caring for your skin...

626
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:13,908
so that Dae Soo will like you.

627
00:39:13,909 --> 00:39:15,668
Why would I do this for Dae Soo?

628
00:39:15,669 --> 00:39:17,138
I'll do it for my own sake.

629
00:39:17,139 --> 00:39:19,738
Besides, there's nothing
between me and Dae Soo.

630
00:39:19,739 --> 00:39:21,019
What do you mean?

631
00:39:21,349 --> 00:39:22,919
I know everything about...

632
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:24,549
you two.

633
00:39:24,949 --> 00:39:26,588
Goodness. Don't be ridiculous.

634
00:39:26,589 --> 00:39:28,638
I don't think you know what's going on.

635
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:30,538
When there's no one else in the office,

636
00:39:30,539 --> 00:39:33,498
he flirts with me like a peacock.

637
00:39:33,499 --> 00:39:35,508
Besides, why would I
meet such an old geezer?

638
00:39:35,509 --> 00:39:37,008
I like someone else.

639
00:39:37,009 --> 00:39:38,849
I like Song Joong Ki.

640
00:39:39,579 --> 00:39:40,798
Is that so?

641
00:39:40,799 --> 00:39:43,889
- I find Mr Shin amazing.
- What about him?

642
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:46,258
I get that he's a prosecutor,

643
00:39:46,259 --> 00:39:49,319
but it must be distressing
to prosecute his own father.

644
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:53,019
- Why are you worried about Mr Shin?
- What?

645
00:39:53,819 --> 00:39:55,258
Now that I think about it,

646
00:39:55,259 --> 00:39:58,279
- you two look great together.
- What?

647
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:00,098
Is there something going
on between you two?

648
00:40:00,099 --> 00:40:01,649
What on earth are you talking about?

649
00:40:02,049 --> 00:40:03,298
We just met...

650
00:40:03,299 --> 00:40:06,328
as an attorney and a prosecutor
at court a few times.

651
00:40:06,329 --> 00:40:07,908
We had drinks a couple of times.
That's all.

652
00:40:07,909 --> 00:40:10,708
You had drinks with him? That says it all.

653
00:40:10,709 --> 00:40:12,308
Gosh, there's nothing going on.

654
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:14,579
What do you mean, nothing?
There's definitely something.

655
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:17,268
Other than the fact that we are
not on good terms with Mr Shin,

656
00:40:17,269 --> 00:40:20,738
as a man, he is tall and good looking.

657
00:40:20,739 --> 00:40:22,558
He seems strong and manly.

658
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:24,168
When he smiles, it's like
looking at a sunflower.

659
00:40:24,169 --> 00:40:25,618
He seems like a great guy.

660
00:40:25,619 --> 00:40:28,838
He's never been in a relationship before.

661
00:40:28,839 --> 00:40:30,698
How do you know so much about him?

662
00:40:30,699 --> 00:40:32,049
- Ms Hwang!
- What?

663
00:40:32,849 --> 00:40:35,479
Would you like me to help you out?

664
00:40:50,749 --> 00:40:51,919
What brings you here?

665
00:41:00,219 --> 00:41:01,419
I'd like...

666
00:41:03,319 --> 00:41:04,679
to defend you.

667
00:41:05,279 --> 00:41:07,319
You want to defend me?

668
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:09,389
I'd like to give you...

669
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:11,849
a chance to atone for your deeds.

670
00:41:13,949 --> 00:41:15,979
I already found a lawyer.

671
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:18,749
I know.

672
00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:23,889
Will you try to prove my innocence?

673
00:41:25,389 --> 00:41:26,449
No.

674
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:29,919
I'd like you to be...

675
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:32,249
judged by the law...

676
00:41:33,049 --> 00:41:35,389
for the crimes you have committed.

677
00:41:38,279 --> 00:41:40,219
It's an interesting suggestion,

678
00:41:40,779 --> 00:41:41,889
but I'm going to decline.

679
00:41:48,619 --> 00:41:49,719
Mr Shin,

680
00:41:50,979 --> 00:41:52,389
take my hand.

681
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:57,149
You offered me...

682
00:41:57,549 --> 00:41:59,389
your hand...

683
00:42:00,279 --> 00:42:02,049
when I had no money or connections.

684
00:42:03,019 --> 00:42:04,049
I think...

685
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:07,889
it's my turn to offer you my hand.

686
00:42:11,389 --> 00:42:12,419
I was...

687
00:42:13,479 --> 00:42:15,049
going to kill you.

688
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:17,319
That's the truth.

689
00:42:19,949 --> 00:42:22,349
I'm willing to pay for that...

690
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:25,649
for as long as you wish.

691
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:30,779
I really appreciate your offer.

692
00:42:31,889 --> 00:42:32,889
I do.

693
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:37,479
Thanks for coming.

694
00:42:58,579 --> 00:43:02,049
(Trial for Shin Young Il for
bribery and inciting murder)

695
00:43:16,219 --> 00:43:17,249
Prosecution.

696
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:19,219
State the charges.

697
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:40,119
Defendant.

698
00:43:55,449 --> 00:43:56,779
Defendant Shin Young Il...

699
00:44:00,449 --> 00:44:02,279
abused his title as Chief Prosecutor...

700
00:44:04,279 --> 00:44:06,119
to incite the murder of Mr Joe.

701
00:44:07,479 --> 00:44:10,319
Furthermore, he accepted bribes...

702
00:44:11,719 --> 00:44:13,749
from Chairman Jung Geun
Moo of Daehwa Group.

703
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:17,949
The prosecution charges the
defendant in accordance with...

704
00:44:18,379 --> 00:44:20,719
Article 31 of the Criminal
Code for murder instigation,

705
00:44:21,679 --> 00:44:24,019
Article 120 for bribery...

706
00:44:24,449 --> 00:44:30,579
and Article 123 for
abusing one's authority.

707
00:45:19,579 --> 00:45:20,919
Everything is over now.

708
00:45:22,479 --> 00:45:24,149
In the end, Mr Shin...

709
00:45:24,949 --> 00:45:26,879
didn't take my hand.

710
00:45:32,019 --> 00:45:34,028
You punk. You asked for this.

711
00:45:34,029 --> 00:45:35,438
Gosh, you stink!

712
00:45:35,439 --> 00:45:36,879
Let go. You smell horrible.

713
00:45:39,349 --> 00:45:40,579
Stop it!

714
00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:47,819
People don't change easily.

715
00:45:49,149 --> 00:45:50,719
When Mr Shin serves out his sentence,

716
00:45:52,019 --> 00:45:55,219
he might become a scarier monster.

717
00:45:57,249 --> 00:45:58,549
But I saw.

718
00:45:59,219 --> 00:46:01,379
I saw him struggle...

719
00:46:01,979 --> 00:46:03,879
when I offered him my hand.

720
00:46:06,379 --> 00:46:07,649
That will suffice.

721
00:46:10,019 --> 00:46:12,619
All I need is hope that the
world and the people in it...

722
00:46:13,549 --> 00:46:15,149
can change.

723
00:46:17,349 --> 00:46:18,449
That is the reason why...

724
00:46:19,319 --> 00:46:20,649
I live on...

725
00:46:21,649 --> 00:46:23,019
as a neighborhood lawyer.

726
00:46:30,779 --> 00:46:33,279
(One year later)

727
00:46:35,319 --> 00:46:40,119
(Court Room 305)

728
00:46:41,249 --> 00:46:43,688
Plaintiff, you were wrongfully
dismissed without...

729
00:46:43,689 --> 00:46:45,679
- any reason, correct?
- Yes.

730
00:46:46,149 --> 00:46:49,019
Please tell us how the company treated you.

731
00:46:49,519 --> 00:46:51,379
It started from petty little things.

732
00:46:51,819 --> 00:46:53,648
First, they bullied me.

733
00:46:53,649 --> 00:46:55,769
Then, they threatened me to
turn in my vacation days.

734
00:46:56,549 --> 00:46:59,749
When I complained, they hired a
new employee and moved my desk.

735
00:47:00,149 --> 00:47:01,469
Where did they move your desk to?

736
00:47:01,949 --> 00:47:03,419
Beside the water purifier.

737
00:47:04,819 --> 00:47:07,549
Everyone must have looked
at you while passing by.

738
00:47:08,179 --> 00:47:09,519
Everyone laughed at me.

739
00:47:11,649 --> 00:47:12,749
Your Honour,

740
00:47:13,549 --> 00:47:15,418
the plaintiff has been...

741
00:47:15,419 --> 00:47:17,649
a loyal employee for the past seven years.

742
00:47:18,019 --> 00:47:19,448
She was wrongfully dismissed...

743
00:47:19,449 --> 00:47:23,479
from her company for one reason.

744
00:47:24,119 --> 00:47:27,019
It was because she applied
for maternity leave.

745
00:47:27,919 --> 00:47:31,649
The labour law states everyone has
the right to take maternity leave.

746
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:35,279
Nonetheless, the plaintiff was dismissed...

747
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:37,279
without a proper reason.

748
00:47:38,879 --> 00:47:40,179
Does that mean...

749
00:47:40,779 --> 00:47:42,979
that she shouldn't have given
birth in the first place?

750
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:47,379
I request your wise decision.

751
00:47:48,349 --> 00:47:50,379
No more questions.

752
00:48:01,849 --> 00:48:02,849
Ms Lee.

753
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:06,519
You were impressive today.

754
00:48:07,779 --> 00:48:09,319
Thank you for the compliment.

755
00:48:09,849 --> 00:48:11,719
My client wants to settle.

756
00:48:12,049 --> 00:48:13,049
What do you say?

757
00:48:13,749 --> 00:48:15,979
If the conditions are
right, we'll consider.

758
00:48:17,749 --> 00:48:21,318
Mr Joe, the other party asked to settle.

759
00:48:21,319 --> 00:48:22,588
Settle?

760
00:48:22,589 --> 00:48:24,949
That's great. We won't need
to continue with the trial.

761
00:48:25,479 --> 00:48:27,128
I'm heading to Geum San.

762
00:48:27,129 --> 00:48:28,579
You should head over, too.

763
00:48:29,679 --> 00:48:31,049
You take care of it.

764
00:48:31,849 --> 00:48:32,849
Me?

765
00:48:33,319 --> 00:48:35,319
Do you want me to decide
on the settlement amount?

766
00:48:35,819 --> 00:48:37,118
You don't want to?

767
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:39,219
No, it's not that I don't want to...

768
00:48:41,219 --> 00:48:43,028
You can't complain later.

769
00:48:43,029 --> 00:48:44,538
You can't nag and complain...

770
00:48:44,539 --> 00:48:47,148
that I didn't ask for more, or that
the conditions aren't good enough.

771
00:48:47,149 --> 00:48:49,028
I'm not a nag.

772
00:48:49,029 --> 00:48:52,049
This case is yours, so you finish it.

773
00:48:52,419 --> 00:48:54,319
You're sure, right? This is my case, right?

774
00:48:54,679 --> 00:48:55,679
That's what I said.

775
00:48:56,479 --> 00:48:59,519
Then naturally, I should decide.

776
00:49:00,779 --> 00:49:01,779
Yes.

777
00:49:11,819 --> 00:49:12,819
Okay.

778
00:49:13,249 --> 00:49:14,249
Let's proceed with this.

779
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:19,949
Ms Lee. You've become a
real pro in just a year.

780
00:49:20,879 --> 00:49:22,479
It's all thanks to Mr Joe.

781
00:49:23,149 --> 00:49:25,968
I've experienced all sorts of battles...

782
00:49:25,969 --> 00:49:27,449
while working with him.

783
00:49:28,619 --> 00:49:29,779
It must be fun.

784
00:49:30,249 --> 00:49:31,368
Pardon?

785
00:49:31,369 --> 00:49:34,479
So much that it doesn't compare
with your time here at Geum San.

786
00:49:35,279 --> 00:49:37,779
Yes. That's true.

787
00:49:38,719 --> 00:49:40,728
How are things in your office?

788
00:49:40,729 --> 00:49:42,519
We're swamped as usual.

789
00:49:42,979 --> 00:49:45,549
He's so famous in the area as you know.

790
00:49:45,919 --> 00:49:47,738
What are you doing? No, no.

791
00:49:47,739 --> 00:49:49,008
- That's not right.
- Come on.

792
00:49:49,009 --> 00:49:50,758
It's almost done.

793
00:49:50,759 --> 00:49:52,538
Word got out that consultations are free,

794
00:49:52,539 --> 00:49:54,219
so people come from afar, too.

795
00:49:54,849 --> 00:49:56,918
If you search online,

796
00:49:56,919 --> 00:49:58,959
it also shows up as "Free
consultation law office".

797
00:49:59,549 --> 00:50:00,968
Are you getting paid regularly?

798
00:50:00,969 --> 00:50:02,019
Of course.

799
00:50:02,349 --> 00:50:04,069
At least I don't have to work odd jobs now.

800
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:07,479
How's Ms Hwang doing?

801
00:50:10,579 --> 00:50:12,918
Get what? A divorce?

802
00:50:12,919 --> 00:50:15,158
Why didn't you do anything...

803
00:50:15,159 --> 00:50:17,368
when I said I was getting married?

804
00:50:17,369 --> 00:50:19,108
You should've stopped me.

805
00:50:19,109 --> 00:50:20,868
You were so in love.

806
00:50:20,869 --> 00:50:22,738
You said you had to get married
because you were pregnant.

807
00:50:22,739 --> 00:50:23,838
Did I?

808
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:25,848
I must have had lost my mind.

809
00:50:25,849 --> 00:50:27,708
I can't live with him.

810
00:50:27,709 --> 00:50:29,408
My gosh. I'm going crazy.

811
00:50:29,409 --> 00:50:31,238
Why are you fighting?

812
00:50:31,239 --> 00:50:32,908
Our personalities and everything clash.

813
00:50:32,909 --> 00:50:34,568
We're too different.

814
00:50:34,569 --> 00:50:35,638
What about the baby?

815
00:50:35,639 --> 00:50:38,468
I'm taking custody of my baby.

816
00:50:38,469 --> 00:50:39,568
Not a chance!

817
00:50:39,569 --> 00:50:41,198
Over my dead body.

818
00:50:41,199 --> 00:50:43,338
Mr Joe, divorce is one thing,

819
00:50:43,339 --> 00:50:46,108
but I need to have full
custody over the baby.

820
00:50:46,109 --> 00:50:48,158
Have you lost your mind?

821
00:50:48,159 --> 00:50:50,038
- Yes, I have!
- It's in my belly.

822
00:50:50,039 --> 00:50:52,628
I won't give you a cent in alimony.

823
00:50:52,629 --> 00:50:55,008
- You have to give her half.
- Right.

824
00:50:55,009 --> 00:50:57,638
I earned all of that before we got married.

825
00:50:57,639 --> 00:50:59,468
- It doesn't matter.
- Mr Joe.

826
00:50:59,469 --> 00:51:00,838
You'll represent me, right?

827
00:51:00,839 --> 00:51:02,768
He's my lawyer.

828
00:51:02,769 --> 00:51:04,138
I worked with him longer.

829
00:51:04,139 --> 00:51:05,868
We're like brothers.

830
00:51:05,869 --> 00:51:07,238
He's closer than my real brother!

831
00:51:07,239 --> 00:51:10,168
See? She's always starting up with me.

832
00:51:10,169 --> 00:51:12,138
She's always starting fights.

833
00:51:12,139 --> 00:51:14,468
You have no right to say that!

834
00:51:14,469 --> 00:51:16,038
Why don't I?

835
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:19,108
Have you once cooked for
me since we got married?

836
00:51:19,109 --> 00:51:22,349
You always feed me instant noodles.
That's not a decent meal.

837
00:51:23,049 --> 00:51:24,149
- Hey.
- Noodles?

838
00:51:24,819 --> 00:51:26,538
Why are you picking on noodles?

839
00:51:26,539 --> 00:51:27,968
I don't believe this.

840
00:51:27,969 --> 00:51:30,708
You said you love noodles so much
that you could eat them every day.

841
00:51:30,709 --> 00:51:33,268
- When did I say that?
- You said my love is all you need.

842
00:51:33,269 --> 00:51:35,598
And that woman!

843
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:37,698
Ask that woman to cook for you.

844
00:51:37,699 --> 00:51:39,938
He has another woman.

845
00:51:39,939 --> 00:51:41,568
- Do you have another woman?
- It's a misunderstanding.

846
00:51:41,569 --> 00:51:42,908
She's a childhood friend.

847
00:51:42,909 --> 00:51:45,338
Who texts their childhood
friend every day and giggles?

848
00:51:45,339 --> 00:51:47,938
- It wasn't every day. It was once.
- It was every day.

849
00:51:47,939 --> 00:51:50,638
- You giggled?
- No, I wrote "laughing out loud".

850
00:51:50,639 --> 00:51:53,748
- Don't lie.
- Forget it!

851
00:51:53,749 --> 00:51:54,868
Goodness.

852
00:51:54,869 --> 00:51:56,208
Fine! Let's get a divorce!

853
00:51:56,209 --> 00:51:57,468
Get a divorce.

854
00:51:57,469 --> 00:52:00,018
What?

855
00:52:00,019 --> 00:52:03,108
Split your assets down the middle,

856
00:52:03,109 --> 00:52:05,538
and cut the baby in half, too.

857
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:07,488
I misjudged you.

858
00:52:07,489 --> 00:52:09,468
- How could you say that?
- What?

859
00:52:09,469 --> 00:52:11,138
How could you say that?

860
00:52:11,139 --> 00:52:12,468
That's what you do when you get a divorce.

861
00:52:12,469 --> 00:52:14,438
I'm so disappointed.

862
00:52:14,439 --> 00:52:16,538
How could you say that?

863
00:52:16,539 --> 00:52:18,049
I'd do the same even if it were me.

864
00:52:19,279 --> 00:52:20,968
Oh my gosh.

865
00:52:20,969 --> 00:52:23,718
What's wrong? What... What's wrong?

866
00:52:23,719 --> 00:52:26,179
What's wrong? Is it the baby?

867
00:52:27,049 --> 00:52:28,379
It's coming.

868
00:52:29,879 --> 00:52:32,308
- How can you cut the baby in half?
- Come here.

869
00:52:32,309 --> 00:52:33,808
- Are you having your baby?
- We'll be back.

870
00:52:33,809 --> 00:52:35,968
- It's your fault!
- Okay, okay.

871
00:52:35,969 --> 00:52:37,138
Is she having her baby?

872
00:52:37,139 --> 00:52:38,808
I think so.

873
00:52:38,809 --> 00:52:39,968
I'm having my baby.

874
00:52:39,969 --> 00:52:41,508
Hold on.

875
00:52:41,509 --> 00:52:42,519
Wait.

876
00:52:43,679 --> 00:52:45,249
Are you serious?

877
00:52:46,579 --> 00:52:47,579
Are you?

878
00:52:55,979 --> 00:52:56,979
Hi, Jin Young.

879
00:52:57,979 --> 00:52:59,259
Where else would I be? I'm home.

880
00:53:00,449 --> 00:53:01,619
Beer?

881
00:53:02,419 --> 00:53:03,649
You should've called sooner.

882
00:53:05,379 --> 00:53:08,519
Okay, okay. I'm coming.

883
00:53:11,579 --> 00:53:13,019
Where is she?

884
00:53:19,379 --> 00:53:20,438
Ms Lee?

885
00:53:20,439 --> 00:53:21,519
Mr Shin.

886
00:53:21,849 --> 00:53:22,849
Hello.

887
00:53:25,879 --> 00:53:28,028
Are you meeting someone here?

888
00:53:28,029 --> 00:53:30,708
Yes. What about you?

889
00:53:30,709 --> 00:53:33,249
Yes. I'm meeting a fellow lawyer friend.

890
00:53:33,579 --> 00:53:34,818
And you?

891
00:53:34,819 --> 00:53:36,319
I... Well...

892
00:53:36,979 --> 00:53:40,219
Seeing how you can't answer me
makes me think it's a blind date.

893
00:53:41,049 --> 00:53:42,108
Yes.

894
00:53:42,109 --> 00:53:43,179
Who set it up?

895
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:45,179
A lawyer friend...

896
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:48,759
- The public defender...
- Oh Jin Young?

897
00:53:51,579 --> 00:53:52,649
Goodness.

898
00:53:54,749 --> 00:53:55,749
Soo Bin.

899
00:53:56,179 --> 00:53:57,179
- Daddy's here.
- Daddy!

900
00:53:57,549 --> 00:54:00,149
You look so pretty.

901
00:54:01,579 --> 00:54:03,498
You look like a princess.

902
00:54:03,499 --> 00:54:05,038
It smells great.

903
00:54:05,039 --> 00:54:07,198
- Hi.
- It smells great.

904
00:54:07,199 --> 00:54:08,249
I made kimchi stew.

905
00:54:08,919 --> 00:54:10,708
Did Mummy make all of this?

906
00:54:10,709 --> 00:54:11,768
Yes.

907
00:54:11,769 --> 00:54:13,708
Really? Wow. I'm impressed.

908
00:54:13,709 --> 00:54:15,038
Actually, we bought it.

909
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:16,608
See? I knew it.

910
00:54:16,609 --> 00:54:17,758
Hey.

911
00:54:17,759 --> 00:54:18,949
Soo Bin. Here.

912
00:54:19,679 --> 00:54:21,819
- Ta-da!
- It looks like you.

913
00:54:23,619 --> 00:54:24,818
It tastes good.

914
00:54:24,819 --> 00:54:25,879
It's spicy.

915
00:54:26,279 --> 00:54:29,808
- Front legs out, hind legs out
- Front legs out, hind legs out

916
00:54:29,809 --> 00:54:33,049
- Leaping, leaping, it became a frog
- Leaping, leaping, it became a frog

917
00:54:43,479 --> 00:54:46,719
The law is not fair to everyone.

918
00:54:48,479 --> 00:54:52,449
It is a time for solitude
and reflection for some.

919
00:54:58,679 --> 00:54:59,679
Hi.

920
00:55:00,379 --> 00:55:01,379
Goodness.

921
00:55:02,119 --> 00:55:03,619
Thanks. Sit.

922
00:55:07,379 --> 00:55:08,379
How have you been?

923
00:55:09,479 --> 00:55:10,479
I've been well.

924
00:55:10,949 --> 00:55:13,308
- Is everything okay?
- To some people's families,

925
00:55:13,309 --> 00:55:14,838
You can't get sick, okay?

926
00:55:14,839 --> 00:55:16,819
It can be a painful wait.

927
00:55:18,519 --> 00:55:19,848
Some have...

928
00:55:19,849 --> 00:55:22,819
a personal lawyer who
visits them every day.

929
00:55:24,519 --> 00:55:27,779
Of course, you must pay a very high fee.

930
00:55:32,449 --> 00:55:33,819
We recommend...

931
00:55:34,179 --> 00:55:35,749
one year in prison.

932
00:55:36,449 --> 00:55:38,479
Defense, make your closing statement.

933
00:55:42,119 --> 00:55:43,119
And here,

934
00:55:43,819 --> 00:55:45,779
there is a person who was detained...

935
00:55:46,249 --> 00:55:47,719
for stealing an eight-dollar candy.

936
00:55:48,379 --> 00:55:49,519
Your Honour,

937
00:55:51,049 --> 00:55:52,049
the defendant is here...

938
00:55:52,719 --> 00:55:54,679
on a charge of theft.

939
00:55:55,449 --> 00:55:57,119
She stole one bag of candy...

940
00:55:58,049 --> 00:55:59,619
from a local supermarket.

941
00:56:00,549 --> 00:56:02,119
The cost of that bag of candy...

942
00:56:03,279 --> 00:56:04,279
is eight dollars.

943
00:56:05,349 --> 00:56:06,549
Because of that eight dollars,

944
00:56:06,979 --> 00:56:09,679
the owner handed her over to the police,

945
00:56:10,149 --> 00:56:12,748
and the police sent her to
the prosecutor because...

946
00:56:12,749 --> 00:56:13,919
it was not her first offense.

947
00:56:16,279 --> 00:56:18,179
The defendant stole the
same bag of candy...

948
00:56:18,649 --> 00:56:20,679
from the same supermarket three times.

949
00:56:21,949 --> 00:56:27,428
The total price of candy that she
stole thus far is 24 dollars.

950
00:56:27,429 --> 00:56:30,238
The wholesale price of the candy...

951
00:56:30,239 --> 00:56:32,188
is half of that,

952
00:56:32,189 --> 00:56:33,449
which is 12 dollars.

953
00:56:33,949 --> 00:56:36,228
Defendant is being detained
at a detention centre...

954
00:56:36,229 --> 00:56:37,979
for 24 dollars.

955
00:56:39,379 --> 00:56:42,238
It was wrong to steal the candy...

956
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:43,449
I am a neighbourhood lawyer.

957
00:56:44,419 --> 00:56:46,279
Most consultations are free,

958
00:56:46,849 --> 00:56:48,528
and no matter how small the case,

959
00:56:48,529 --> 00:56:50,318
if the client was wronged,

960
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:52,419
I defend them regardless of the fee.

961
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:55,649
I am not a warrior of justice.

962
00:56:57,379 --> 00:56:59,148
I am not Superman,

963
00:56:59,149 --> 00:57:00,519
as Soo Bin thinks.

964
00:57:01,949 --> 00:57:02,949
However,

965
00:57:03,279 --> 00:57:04,649
if I see someone who is wronged,

966
00:57:05,419 --> 00:57:06,819
I can't just walk on by.

967
00:57:09,679 --> 00:57:10,679
As long as...

968
00:57:11,349 --> 00:57:14,149
there are people who are wronged in
my neighbourhood and in this land,

969
00:57:15,819 --> 00:57:18,319
I will continue to do my job.

970
00:57:19,749 --> 00:57:21,879
Regardless of how petty the crime,

971
00:57:22,349 --> 00:57:24,668
the punishment was escalated...

972
00:57:24,669 --> 00:57:26,918
because it was her third offense.

973
00:57:26,919 --> 00:57:28,779
Don't you think this is wrong?

974
00:57:51,549 --> 00:57:55,019
(My Lawyer, Mr Joe)
