1
00:00:16,392 --> 00:00:19,691
Nice and warm.

2
00:00:22,198 --> 00:00:23,859
Watch your feet!

3
00:00:26,502 --> 00:00:27,764
Twice.

4
00:00:31,174 --> 00:00:32,300
Sleep well.

5
00:00:35,611 --> 00:00:37,511
Pleasant dreams.

6
00:00:52,395 --> 00:00:53,726
Eyes shut.

7
00:00:55,164 --> 00:00:56,654
You'll get the white.

8
00:01:05,508 --> 00:01:07,203
Not your turn!

9
00:01:23,226 --> 00:01:25,319
Go to the sacristy tomorrow.

10
00:01:25,528 --> 00:01:26,859
Ask them to say a mass.

11
00:01:26,996 --> 00:01:29,590
- For whom?
- For my purposes.

12
00:01:29,732 --> 00:01:32,326
But don't tell a soul. Don't tell Dad.

13
00:01:35,471 --> 00:01:38,269
l'm to say, ''Here's a coin.''

14
00:01:38,407 --> 00:01:40,875
l want a mass said
for Thérèse's special purposes.

15
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:43,274
- Not very serious!
- lt's a secret.

16
00:01:43,412 --> 00:01:44,208
Go on.

17
00:01:44,347 --> 00:01:46,212
Between a mean man and me.

18
00:01:46,349 --> 00:01:47,873
Tell, or l'll pinch you.

19
00:01:48,217 --> 00:01:49,275
lt's for a killer.

20
00:01:49,485 --> 00:01:51,817
- Know him?
- No. lt's Pranzini.

21
00:01:51,954 --> 00:01:54,821
That monster! He did 3 women in!

22
00:01:54,957 --> 00:01:57,425
He's too proud to beg for forgiveness.

23
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,721
He cut a child's throat.

24
00:01:59,895 --> 00:02:02,363
l'll save him before they cut his.

25
00:02:02,498 --> 00:02:03,590
A mass for...

26
00:02:03,733 --> 00:02:04,893
lmpossible!

27
00:02:05,301 --> 00:02:06,825
l'm not asking him for much.

28
00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:10,803
Just a little remorse. To console me.

29
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,805
What do l tell the priest?

30
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:14,866
Let me. lt's my business.

31
00:02:30,626 --> 00:02:32,423
Go to sleep.

32
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:25,404
What are you doing?

33
00:03:41,864 --> 00:03:43,388
Come see.

34
00:03:47,503 --> 00:03:51,303
At the guillotine,
Pranzini pushed away the executioner.

35
00:03:51,741 --> 00:03:53,038
''Leave me,'' he said.

36
00:03:53,142 --> 00:03:54,609
He rejected the priest...

37
00:03:54,677 --> 00:03:56,804
but kissed the crucifix.

38
00:03:57,146 --> 00:03:59,808
He died at 5:02 this morning.

39
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:01,906
He kissed it!

40
00:04:02,885 --> 00:04:04,443
He's saved!

41
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,188
l saved him! l won!

42
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,823
Oh, Terry, my pet...

43
00:04:09,091 --> 00:04:10,752
What a gift you have!

44
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,957
l'm so thirsty.

45
00:04:13,963 --> 00:04:17,262
Haven't had a drop all day.
My throat's on fire.

46
00:04:19,568 --> 00:04:20,796
Slowly!

47
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,998
- Was that also for his sake?
- lt wasn't hard.

48
00:04:24,407 --> 00:04:27,171
- l bet Mom's watching.
- She'll be glad.

49
00:04:27,276 --> 00:04:28,436
Put it back.

50
00:04:28,677 --> 00:04:30,611
l see my Pranzini in his cell.

51
00:04:30,713 --> 00:04:32,772
Dawn. Door opens slowly.

52
00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:35,474
''Come, sir. Time to lose your head!''

53
00:04:35,618 --> 00:04:36,710
Hush, Terry!

54
00:04:37,052 --> 00:04:40,180
l wish l'd been with him, held his hand.

55
00:04:42,091 --> 00:04:43,285
Put it back.

56
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:45,627
Why shouldn't we read it?

57
00:05:15,658 --> 00:05:18,923
Thank you, Jesus.

58
00:05:19,762 --> 00:05:20,820
Anything wrong?

59
00:05:20,896 --> 00:05:22,227
Not at all.

60
00:05:22,298 --> 00:05:24,789
When Pauline and Marie
became Carmelites...

61
00:05:25,768 --> 00:05:27,099
how did you feel?

62
00:05:27,236 --> 00:05:28,999
- Want to know?
- Yes.

63
00:05:29,171 --> 00:05:31,537
Giving 2 daughters away is an honor.

64
00:05:31,607 --> 00:05:33,837
- And?
- Not really a pleasure.

65
00:05:33,976 --> 00:05:35,705
But l'm proud of them.

66
00:05:35,778 --> 00:05:39,714
Be proud of me, too.
l'm in love with Jesus, l'll marry him.

67
00:05:39,915 --> 00:05:41,348
Bored with me here?

68
00:05:41,417 --> 00:05:43,408
He chose me with his arms open.

69
00:05:43,619 --> 00:05:45,143
Dreams.

70
00:05:45,287 --> 00:05:47,346
He's courting me, what can l do?

71
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:51,026
l want to pray, save a lot of people for him.

72
00:05:51,093 --> 00:05:53,721
So young, so fragile. You'll be turned down.

73
00:05:53,796 --> 00:05:55,354
You know nothing.

74
00:05:55,464 --> 00:05:57,898
But he knows. He'll teach me.

75
00:05:59,435 --> 00:06:01,300
l knew you'd be sad.

76
00:06:01,704 --> 00:06:05,196
You're my king, too. Nothing's changed.

77
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:07,439
We'll never be apart.

78
00:06:19,054 --> 00:06:21,716
- What's with her?
- She has a cold.

79
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:26,189
- And Dad?
- So-so. Better.

80
00:06:26,328 --> 00:06:28,728
- And you?
- Something is wrong, Terry.

81
00:06:28,797 --> 00:06:31,391
l hardly sleep or eat. l'm not all there.

82
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,401
Don't worry, kid. We'll help you. Be patient.

83
00:06:34,537 --> 00:06:36,835
l don't want to wait, or be unfaithful.

84
00:06:36,906 --> 00:06:37,964
Honeybunch...

85
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,838
no one is asking you to do so.
And don't say ''l want.''

86
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:43,378
lf ever l was, l'd be disappointed.

87
00:06:44,346 --> 00:06:48,680
Quit worrying. You'll never meet the boy
who could satisfy you.

88
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:50,081
He doesn't exist.

89
00:06:50,185 --> 00:06:53,052
- Eat sweets, enjoy yourself.
- Have fun.

90
00:06:53,188 --> 00:06:54,712
Go to Paris with Dad.

91
00:06:54,924 --> 00:06:57,154
And risk a broken leg before l'm here?

92
00:06:57,626 --> 00:07:00,220
l have a friend, can't say who...

93
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:02,623
who fears dying before knowing love.

94
00:07:02,731 --> 00:07:04,130
That's Clothilde!

95
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:07,327
The way she looks at men!

96
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:11,572
l plucked it for you.
Last one from the garden.

97
00:07:13,275 --> 00:07:17,678
Teresita,
l doubt you'll be joining us that soon.

98
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,571
My hands are tied. Men decide.

99
00:07:21,584 --> 00:07:26,044
l know this town,
l don't need such a scandal...

100
00:07:26,255 --> 00:07:28,052
about Thérèse entering Carmel.

101
00:07:28,123 --> 00:07:30,683
Again people will say,
and l've heard them say it:

102
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:33,227
''ltchy Martin! He likes to travel.

103
00:07:33,295 --> 00:07:34,990
''So he's getting rid of his daughters.''

104
00:07:35,064 --> 00:07:36,156
That's horrible.

105
00:07:36,231 --> 00:07:38,529
That's how it is. The world is vile.

106
00:07:39,368 --> 00:07:40,892
l won't say yes for 3 years.

107
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,398
l'll die before.

108
00:07:42,538 --> 00:07:46,065
You're too young to endure such hardships.
Carmel is tough.

109
00:07:46,308 --> 00:07:47,673
You should know.

110
00:07:47,977 --> 00:07:51,208
- l'll move mountains.
- The mother superior agrees.

111
00:07:51,313 --> 00:07:54,976
Why push me? There's no fire.

112
00:07:55,584 --> 00:07:58,348
Go see the bishop if you wish.

113
00:07:58,654 --> 00:08:01,088
My answer, however, is no.

114
00:08:01,156 --> 00:08:02,987
Definitely no.

115
00:08:03,492 --> 00:08:05,483
End of discussion. l'm not mean...

116
00:08:05,628 --> 00:08:08,495
but l'm responsible for the convent.

117
00:08:08,998 --> 00:08:10,431
l must protect it.

118
00:08:12,801 --> 00:08:17,363
Strange.
Both father and daughter in such a hurry.

119
00:08:17,506 --> 00:08:21,237
l can sum it up in 2 words:
patience and hope.

120
00:08:21,377 --> 00:08:23,174
Months go fast, days are like hours.

121
00:08:23,646 --> 00:08:27,514
Why does Jesus make me
desire something...

122
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:29,778
and refuse it to me?

123
00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:33,284
lt is to test you, to strengthen your calling.

124
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:34,817
Test me?

125
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:38,089
Why test me if l can't bear it?

126
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:40,491
l must tell you the truth.

127
00:08:40,629 --> 00:08:44,065
On our way here, Thérèse told me...

128
00:08:44,199 --> 00:08:48,431
that if you refuse, she will ask the pope.

129
00:08:48,671 --> 00:08:51,435
We'll apply for the next pilgrimage to Rome.

130
00:09:10,325 --> 00:09:12,657
Forget everybody around you.

131
00:09:12,795 --> 00:09:14,194
Got it pat?

132
00:09:14,329 --> 00:09:16,820
Yes. ''Your Holiness, l have a big favor.''

133
00:09:17,132 --> 00:09:19,464
All l want is a yes. l hope he says it.

134
00:09:26,508 --> 00:09:30,000
You are next. Don't speak to his Holiness.

135
00:09:30,846 --> 00:09:32,643
He is ill.

136
00:09:46,295 --> 00:09:48,195
l have a favor to ask you.

137
00:09:48,864 --> 00:09:51,264
Please let me enter Carmel.

138
00:09:52,334 --> 00:09:55,394
This very young girl wishes to enter Carmel.

139
00:09:55,571 --> 00:09:57,664
lt is being taken care of.

140
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:04,472
You must obey your superiors, my child.

141
00:10:05,247 --> 00:10:08,307
Say yes and everyone will agree!

142
00:10:12,421 --> 00:10:14,946
You'll go, if heaven wishes.

143
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:17,458
Say yes, your Holiness!

144
00:10:19,294 --> 00:10:20,488
Say yes!

145
00:10:35,644 --> 00:10:37,908
Tell father that everyone...

146
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:41,645
thoroughly enjoyed his pear tarts.

147
00:10:41,784 --> 00:10:45,777
The crust was crunchy. Just as l like it.

148
00:10:46,822 --> 00:10:48,813
Lost your tongue?

149
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:53,518
My one visit a week, l save it for you,
and what do l get, a wall.

150
00:10:54,663 --> 00:10:57,723
Quit sulking or l'll pull the curtain.

151
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,792
l warned you...

152
00:10:59,902 --> 00:11:00,800
Stop!

153
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:01,893
lt's scary.

154
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:06,202
lf we weren't sisters,
we'd have to talk like this.

155
00:11:06,341 --> 00:11:08,605
- Open.
- lf you smile.

156
00:11:08,777 --> 00:11:10,301
Open or l'll go!

157
00:11:11,346 --> 00:11:14,247
Blackmail doesn't work here!

158
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:17,184
The cardinal wrote to Mother Superior.

159
00:11:17,319 --> 00:11:21,221
He entrusts her with the decision.
No explanation.

160
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,483
Now you tell me?

161
00:11:24,293 --> 00:11:25,783
How wonderful!

162
00:11:25,928 --> 00:11:30,592
l'm not going to cry, l promise!

163
00:11:32,501 --> 00:11:35,368
lt's very cold, we have no heat.

164
00:11:35,504 --> 00:11:38,268
We're fasting till Easter. You're growing up.

165
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:40,807
l suggested you join us in the spring.

166
00:11:40,943 --> 00:11:42,308
Spring?

167
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:46,412
l want you to make it.
Let's place all the odds on your side.

168
00:11:46,548 --> 00:11:49,984
ls that so! What does Marie think?

169
00:11:50,285 --> 00:11:53,345
We're not keeping you out
of our husband's house.

170
00:11:53,488 --> 00:11:55,285
But you could knock some more.

171
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:57,187
l have knocked, Pauline, l have.

172
00:11:57,259 --> 00:11:59,659
Keep knocking. Suffering is the key.

173
00:11:59,862 --> 00:12:00,988
Not love?

174
00:12:02,965 --> 00:12:06,799
You're engaged.
Come on, wait a bit for the wedding.

175
00:12:07,069 --> 00:12:08,900
You want it all at once.

176
00:12:09,004 --> 00:12:12,269
- Yes! l must act quickly.
- Why?

177
00:12:12,608 --> 00:12:14,303
Let's not talk about me.

178
00:12:29,591 --> 00:12:31,718
Don't go catch cold now.

179
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,521
No chance.

180
00:12:59,721 --> 00:13:01,450
You're adorable.

181
00:13:02,357 --> 00:13:05,588
Go back to bed. l'm better.

182
00:13:05,727 --> 00:13:07,456
lt's over.

183
00:13:10,032 --> 00:13:12,364
Lord, your love is ferocious.

184
00:13:17,906 --> 00:13:21,034
l'm frightened. Hold me.

185
00:13:21,143 --> 00:13:22,508
What if l'm wrong?

186
00:13:23,045 --> 00:13:24,740
Hold me tight!

187
00:13:26,982 --> 00:13:29,075
l'll never be able to leave you.

188
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:39,517
Come back, Sebastian. l love you.

189
00:13:45,901 --> 00:13:47,960
- For me?
- Yes.

190
00:13:51,974 --> 00:13:54,568
- lt's too small.
- lt won't fit?

191
00:13:56,478 --> 00:13:57,638
l can't.

192
00:13:59,681 --> 00:14:01,444
lt doesn't fit?

193
00:14:03,118 --> 00:14:07,077
l wanted to give you a present. But what?

194
00:14:09,191 --> 00:14:11,318
So here's my pencil box.

195
00:14:16,164 --> 00:14:18,462
Of course, Bernard's name is on it.

196
00:14:19,501 --> 00:14:21,196
You'll think of me?

197
00:14:21,336 --> 00:14:22,769
- You'll write?
- Yes.

198
00:14:23,505 --> 00:14:25,439
What'll l do without you?

199
00:14:25,707 --> 00:14:27,004
You'll come too.

200
00:14:27,109 --> 00:14:30,169
Don't talk nonsense.

201
00:14:31,213 --> 00:14:33,238
He'll come for you.

202
00:14:33,382 --> 00:14:34,576
And Sebastian?

203
00:14:34,816 --> 00:14:37,341
He'll love you more. He'll never betray you.

204
00:14:37,552 --> 00:14:40,180
- And my jam?
- Let's see...

205
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:42,614
Push!

206
00:14:44,659 --> 00:14:46,058
You'll have to bring it.

207
00:15:04,646 --> 00:15:05,806
You desire?

208
00:15:06,181 --> 00:15:07,375
His mercy.

209
00:15:07,549 --> 00:15:10,643
The poverty of the Order
and company of the sisters.

210
00:15:10,852 --> 00:15:12,786
Are you determined to persevere?

211
00:15:13,688 --> 00:15:16,248
l wish and hope to do so...

212
00:15:16,391 --> 00:15:20,350
with His mercy
and the prayers of the sisters.

213
00:15:22,364 --> 00:15:24,491
l'm not worthy for you to come in.

214
00:15:24,866 --> 00:15:27,596
But say a word and l'll be cured.

215
00:15:28,703 --> 00:15:30,330
The body of Christ.

216
00:15:45,454 --> 00:15:48,082
l too wanted to be a bride.

217
00:15:48,857 --> 00:15:50,381
l'm happy for you.

218
00:15:53,462 --> 00:15:55,726
Thanks for coming from so far.

219
00:17:19,781 --> 00:17:24,184
Take on the slight burden of Jesus.

220
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,344
Those who follow the pure lamb...

221
00:17:26,621 --> 00:17:30,318
will be part of his sparkling white escort.

222
00:17:51,546 --> 00:17:53,377
My beloved speaks.

223
00:17:53,582 --> 00:17:55,982
He says, ''Come, my beloved, come.''

224
00:17:56,284 --> 00:18:00,243
Winter is over. The rain has stopped.

225
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:04,254
How l've longed for this day!

226
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,590
l'll give my life for you.

227
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:13,696
l'll be yours forever.

228
00:18:15,337 --> 00:18:17,305
l am not perfect...

229
00:18:18,974 --> 00:18:22,034
help me to do good, to help others...

230
00:18:23,044 --> 00:18:25,410
to please you.

231
00:18:27,849 --> 00:18:32,377
l wish l were already up there, to see you.

232
00:18:34,856 --> 00:18:38,383
Jesus was greeted by the waiting crowd.

233
00:18:38,526 --> 00:18:41,962
A woman there had been bleeding
for 1 2 years.

234
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:45,395
She'd spent all her money
but no doctor could cure her.

235
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:49,300
She touched Jesus' garments.

236
00:18:49,571 --> 00:18:52,335
She stopped bleeding instantly.

237
00:18:52,474 --> 00:18:54,806
Jesus said, ''Who touched me?''

238
00:18:54,976 --> 00:18:57,240
Peter and his friends said:

239
00:18:57,512 --> 00:19:00,640
You're in a crowd,
and you wonder who touched you?

240
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:04,114
Jesus said, ''Someone touched me.''

241
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,651
l felt a force leave me.

242
00:19:07,322 --> 00:19:11,019
The woman threw herself at his feet
and told him publicly...

243
00:19:11,092 --> 00:19:13,424
how touching him had cured her.

244
00:19:13,762 --> 00:19:14,820
Jesus said:

245
00:19:14,896 --> 00:19:17,490
''Your faith saved you. Go in peace.''

246
00:19:28,143 --> 00:19:30,839
Lie on the floor outside the refectory.

247
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:32,410
Yes, Mother.

248
00:20:36,211 --> 00:20:37,906
Passing by me...

249
00:20:38,046 --> 00:20:41,243
he said it was time for me to be loved.

250
00:20:42,183 --> 00:20:44,378
Washed me with perfumes...

251
00:20:44,552 --> 00:20:47,112
gave me lace to wear.

252
00:20:47,422 --> 00:20:52,018
He fed me the purest flour
and honey in abundance.

253
00:20:52,227 --> 00:20:54,855
l became beautiful in his eyes.

254
00:20:54,996 --> 00:20:58,591
He made me a powerful queen.

255
00:22:16,277 --> 00:22:19,075
That was my husband.

256
00:22:20,515 --> 00:22:22,142
My husband.

257
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:27,214
l hardly knew him. He sold wood.

258
00:22:27,355 --> 00:22:30,051
His horse threw him one day.
Smashed his head.

259
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:33,423
l've had it on the sly for 50 years.

260
00:22:34,028 --> 00:22:36,189
l've known many Mothers Superior...

261
00:22:36,431 --> 00:22:38,456
never could confess it.

262
00:22:39,467 --> 00:22:41,059
Take it.

263
00:22:41,636 --> 00:22:44,332
Ask our Mother to keep it.

264
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:50,276
You're silent, you obey the rules.

265
00:22:50,445 --> 00:22:51,639
That's good.

266
00:22:53,114 --> 00:22:55,480
At my age, not talking all day...

267
00:22:57,218 --> 00:22:58,310
is hard.

268
00:23:01,523 --> 00:23:03,684
Now give me a kiss.

269
00:23:04,626 --> 00:23:06,753
A real kiss.

270
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:11,357
The kind that warms you up.

271
00:23:40,128 --> 00:23:41,322
Put it there.

272
00:23:41,696 --> 00:23:43,391
We knew all about it.

273
00:23:44,432 --> 00:23:47,697
Tell no one though.
We can't agree whether...

274
00:23:48,002 --> 00:23:50,493
to let her keep it or not. What do you think?

275
00:23:50,705 --> 00:23:52,332
She no longer wants it.

276
00:23:53,174 --> 00:23:56,405
l like her.
A broken heart can make a good Carmelite.

277
00:23:57,412 --> 00:24:01,246
She had some money.
She added butter to our bread.

278
00:24:03,017 --> 00:24:05,315
You have little to say to your superior.

279
00:24:05,587 --> 00:24:07,077
The words fail me.

280
00:24:07,221 --> 00:24:09,781
They won't come to your lips?
Write them down.

281
00:24:11,326 --> 00:24:15,228
Why not write down your feelings
and your memories here?

282
00:24:17,031 --> 00:24:19,556
lt might be interesting. Do it for me.

283
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,366
Take this.

284
00:24:27,542 --> 00:24:29,442
Bring it back when it is full.

285
00:24:29,644 --> 00:24:30,838
Yes, Mother.

286
00:24:54,268 --> 00:24:55,599
l'll call our Mother.

287
00:24:56,871 --> 00:25:01,103
No... Your hand...

288
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:03,836
He is the Consoler...

289
00:25:04,145 --> 00:25:07,581
always beside us, loving...

290
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:10,710
Not in a hurry!

291
00:26:23,658 --> 00:26:28,652
Sheets, family, Mother Superior.
Us = servants.

292
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,607
We've been washing.

293
00:27:08,936 --> 00:27:11,666
- The scissors.
- They're on the way.

294
00:27:11,806 --> 00:27:15,242
They aren't here yet... Small scissors.

295
00:27:23,584 --> 00:27:28,214
Give me roots or give me wings...

296
00:27:29,357 --> 00:27:31,689
like you.

297
00:27:47,241 --> 00:27:49,971
You didn't drink the hot milk.
Nor the potion.

298
00:27:50,044 --> 00:27:51,136
Sorry, no.

299
00:27:51,212 --> 00:27:54,113
You must!
Tomorrow l'll give you a rubdown.

300
00:27:54,515 --> 00:27:58,474
l'd rather not. lt's not like we were at home.

301
00:27:59,053 --> 00:28:00,452
Or what's the point?

302
00:28:00,588 --> 00:28:02,783
True, you're no longer a kid sister...

303
00:28:03,457 --> 00:28:05,550
but a sister like the others.

304
00:28:05,927 --> 00:28:09,556
- l must get used to it.
- We're sisters even more.

305
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:11,797
Did l hurt you?

306
00:28:12,333 --> 00:28:13,527
No.

307
00:28:17,071 --> 00:28:18,766
l sleep, but not my heart.

308
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:20,897
l hear my beloved knock.

309
00:28:21,042 --> 00:28:24,205
Open, my sister, my friend,
my dove, my perfection.

310
00:28:24,312 --> 00:28:28,442
For my head is covered with dew,
my curls glisten from the night.

311
00:28:29,984 --> 00:28:33,476
My beloved, come into your garden.

312
00:28:33,621 --> 00:28:36,021
Take the fruit of your trees.

313
00:28:36,657 --> 00:28:39,592
My beloved instructs my soul...

314
00:28:39,861 --> 00:28:43,490
speaking to it in silence and in darkness.

315
00:28:47,602 --> 00:28:49,832
He wasn't in the kitchen.

316
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:53,501
Normally he'd be making breakfast.

317
00:28:53,975 --> 00:28:57,376
l went to his room.
He was on the floor by the bed.

318
00:29:44,558 --> 00:29:47,823
He caught these today.
He fears you might need them.

319
00:29:48,229 --> 00:29:49,218
Poor father.

320
00:29:49,363 --> 00:29:51,354
He's my baby. l'm a mother to him.

321
00:29:51,499 --> 00:29:52,625
ls he in pain?

322
00:29:52,767 --> 00:29:55,201
He tries hard to talk with his eyes.

323
00:29:55,336 --> 00:29:57,998
- ls he in pain?
- Being helpless hurts.

324
00:29:58,172 --> 00:30:00,504
- He understands us?
- Just a bit.

325
00:30:00,908 --> 00:30:03,172
lf l leave him, he moans like an animal...

326
00:30:03,711 --> 00:30:05,372
until l come back.

327
00:30:10,718 --> 00:30:12,345
He often does that.

328
00:30:12,853 --> 00:30:16,846
l thought, he's ashamed.
But it's something else.

329
00:30:17,591 --> 00:30:18,319
What?

330
00:30:18,459 --> 00:30:19,483
Only he knows.

331
00:30:19,627 --> 00:30:21,458
He'll be a sun in heaven.

332
00:30:22,496 --> 00:30:25,522
Here's oil from the Holy Face.

333
00:30:26,667 --> 00:30:28,464
He carries a gun.

334
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:30,598
lt's loaded.

335
00:30:30,738 --> 00:30:31,966
- Quiet.
- Go on.

336
00:30:33,674 --> 00:30:35,869
At any sound, he pulls it out.

337
00:30:37,645 --> 00:30:39,306
Thinks l'm in danger.

338
00:30:41,248 --> 00:30:44,775
So no one comes over. Not even Sebastian.

339
00:30:46,554 --> 00:30:47,953
Everyone thinks...

340
00:30:48,789 --> 00:30:51,417
it's your fault, you and your sisters.

341
00:30:51,792 --> 00:30:54,192
Especially you, Thérèse.

342
00:30:54,428 --> 00:30:56,794
- That you killed him.
- That's enough!

343
00:30:57,631 --> 00:31:00,600
That you're selfish, useless and crazy.

344
00:31:01,369 --> 00:31:02,802
Don't get all worked up.

345
00:31:02,937 --> 00:31:04,268
That's the rumor.

346
00:31:04,405 --> 00:31:06,270
l hate when you exaggerate.

347
00:31:06,407 --> 00:31:07,499
We can't talk any longer.

348
00:31:07,641 --> 00:31:10,974
Let's all kneel and pray for father.

349
00:31:21,889 --> 00:31:26,451
Sundays are difficult.
All your things are still there.

350
00:31:28,496 --> 00:31:30,964
Give me the handkerchief, l'll wash it.

351
00:31:34,468 --> 00:31:36,026
Control yourself!

352
00:32:06,867 --> 00:32:08,892
l won't tell a soul.

353
00:32:09,036 --> 00:32:11,732
You're lucky to have such a family.

354
00:32:47,308 --> 00:32:48,206
Speak.

355
00:32:48,342 --> 00:32:51,368
May l keep my father's handkerchief?

356
00:32:51,612 --> 00:32:53,773
lf you have nothing else from home...

357
00:32:54,081 --> 00:32:55,480
l have a pencil box.

358
00:32:55,783 --> 00:32:58,081
You'll return the handkerchief.

359
00:32:58,385 --> 00:32:59,647
Yes, Mother.

360
00:32:59,787 --> 00:33:03,780
Carmel cannot pay...

361
00:33:04,291 --> 00:33:08,318
the property taxes.

362
00:33:14,335 --> 00:33:16,803
- You want to talk?
- No, Mother.

363
00:33:17,638 --> 00:33:19,572
l wanted to say, l had a dream.

364
00:33:19,773 --> 00:33:23,834
You gave everyone a gift.
My turn came, there was nothing left.

365
00:33:25,179 --> 00:33:25,873
And?

366
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:29,411
l'm ashamed. Can't tell you, Mother.

367
00:33:30,184 --> 00:33:33,813
Speak properly, make complete sentences.

368
00:33:34,121 --> 00:33:38,217
My turn came, there was nothing left.
Your hands were empty.

369
00:33:38,726 --> 00:33:42,218
You smiled and said, ''l give you my heart.''

370
00:33:42,596 --> 00:33:44,655
Such a gift is a godsend.

371
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:47,563
l wish to be a saint.

372
00:33:47,701 --> 00:33:48,633
Pride.

373
00:33:48,769 --> 00:33:52,535
No, l'll become a great saint in secret.

374
00:33:52,773 --> 00:33:56,140
Only He will know.

375
00:33:56,911 --> 00:33:59,243
No credit due to me, Mother.

376
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,914
Don't always say ''Mother.''

377
00:34:02,883 --> 00:34:05,215
l'll not consider you a child.

378
00:34:05,352 --> 00:34:08,253
You're strong.
l'll never fear to humiliate you.

379
00:34:09,123 --> 00:34:12,718
As the last to enter,
you are everyone's servant.

380
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,657
That should make you happy.

381
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,925
He brought me to his wine cellar.

382
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:24,629
He poured his friendship in me.

383
00:34:25,539 --> 00:34:30,272
Sustain me with flowers,
strengthen me with fruit.

384
00:34:30,444 --> 00:34:32,378
l pine away for love.

385
00:34:33,581 --> 00:34:37,642
He puts one hand on my head,
the other embraces me.

386
00:35:42,016 --> 00:35:43,950
l'm allowed to talk to you.

387
00:35:44,518 --> 00:35:47,510
About everything, with no witnesses.

388
00:35:47,755 --> 00:35:48,744
Great!

389
00:35:48,889 --> 00:35:51,551
l had to ask three times for it.

390
00:35:51,692 --> 00:35:52,989
Thanks for trying.

391
00:35:53,294 --> 00:35:54,818
My pleasure.

392
00:35:55,863 --> 00:35:56,887
Your Mother?

393
00:35:57,031 --> 00:35:58,999
Yet another wire. She won't come.

394
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,632
Oh? How's your eczema?

395
00:36:01,769 --> 00:36:02,793
Worse.

396
00:36:02,936 --> 00:36:04,301
And the rest?

397
00:36:04,605 --> 00:36:06,903
My periods are gone, my tummy's a mess.

398
00:36:07,041 --> 00:36:10,340
This isn't a sacrifice, it's a massacre!

399
00:36:10,477 --> 00:36:12,775
My body's here, my mind's elsewhere.

400
00:36:13,047 --> 00:36:13,843
Well!

401
00:36:14,648 --> 00:36:17,674
Gift from the chemist!

402
00:36:17,951 --> 00:36:20,886
Boil it 20 minutes,
then call Mother Superior.

403
00:36:26,026 --> 00:36:27,493
l'm becoming stupid!

404
00:36:27,628 --> 00:36:31,257
They tell me to stretch toward perfection.

405
00:36:31,498 --> 00:36:34,763
The way l see it, l'm stretching thin.

406
00:36:34,835 --> 00:36:36,302
That's my whole spiritual life.

407
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:37,632
We're so tiny.

408
00:36:38,539 --> 00:36:39,972
We don't have great thoughts.

409
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,871
l try hard, but no one notices.

410
00:36:42,009 --> 00:36:44,307
- He does.
- Oh, him...

411
00:36:44,378 --> 00:36:46,278
Fondle him, that's how l snared him.

412
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,108
- l'm not his type.
- He fancies you!

413
00:36:49,283 --> 00:36:50,716
He stands me up.

414
00:36:50,851 --> 00:36:53,547
- Playing. He'll be back.
- l'll shut my door!

415
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,644
He'll crawl.

416
00:36:54,722 --> 00:36:57,316
On his knees? That'll do him good!

417
00:36:57,458 --> 00:36:59,949
- He'll beg you.
- Yes! Yes!

418
00:37:13,907 --> 00:37:15,340
We're nuts!

419
00:37:17,711 --> 00:37:20,805
Falling for a guy dead 2000 years.
lf he ever existed!

420
00:37:20,948 --> 00:37:23,439
- He did.
- lt's all in the mind.

421
00:37:31,091 --> 00:37:32,558
Know what l do in bed?

422
00:37:32,826 --> 00:37:34,293
lt'll make you blind.

423
00:37:34,395 --> 00:37:35,692
l'm ashamed.

424
00:37:37,731 --> 00:37:39,392
You're cutting on his share.

425
00:37:39,533 --> 00:37:42,400
l've put these all over.

426
00:37:42,803 --> 00:37:44,270
And that will lure him?

427
00:37:44,405 --> 00:37:46,635
l like him a bit rough. Or else...

428
00:37:56,617 --> 00:37:58,710
lt's the devil!

429
00:37:58,852 --> 00:38:00,376
As ugly as the seven sins!

430
00:38:39,259 --> 00:38:40,954
- Cut your tongue?
- A scratch.

431
00:38:41,061 --> 00:38:43,029
l'll tell the boss.

432
00:38:43,263 --> 00:38:47,290
Don't. lt's nothing, really. Gone, see?

433
00:38:47,434 --> 00:38:51,131
l'll report you right away. l love squealing.

434
00:38:57,478 --> 00:39:00,709
Your tomcat is the talk of the town, Mother.

435
00:39:02,216 --> 00:39:06,482
They say you woke your girls one night
to find him.

436
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:11,314
You had them catch birds...

437
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:15,060
and stew them so your pet could feast.

438
00:39:16,463 --> 00:39:18,693
lt is true. l had that weakness.

439
00:39:18,832 --> 00:39:20,800
l asked them to forgive me.

440
00:39:21,368 --> 00:39:22,562
Step up.

441
00:39:25,205 --> 00:39:27,799
Press your chest against the grating.

442
00:39:29,443 --> 00:39:31,343
Where is your heart?

443
00:39:37,384 --> 00:39:40,512
l had a lump under my jaw,
but now it's gone.

444
00:39:41,455 --> 00:39:44,652
Here, l'm not a man, but a doctor.
Take off this sack.

445
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:50,453
Open the window.

446
00:39:57,538 --> 00:40:00,871
Just a broken vessel in your throat.

447
00:40:01,208 --> 00:40:03,267
Or perhaps in your nose.

448
00:40:04,144 --> 00:40:05,509
- Eat well?
- Too well.

449
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:06,670
How so?

450
00:40:08,715 --> 00:40:11,445
l'm always hungry.
lt often wakes me at night.

451
00:40:11,852 --> 00:40:13,444
A touch of anemia.

452
00:40:15,689 --> 00:40:19,750
Give her fats and red meat for a month.
Whatever it costs.

453
00:40:21,128 --> 00:40:24,495
An odd thing occurred
at Mestivier's wedding.

454
00:40:25,399 --> 00:40:28,857
Céline was about to dance
with the most handsome guy...

455
00:40:29,169 --> 00:40:32,502
when suddenly her knees jammed,
as if paralyzed.

456
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:34,532
They had to help her sit.

457
00:40:34,775 --> 00:40:37,938
He was so embarrassed, he vanished.

458
00:40:42,182 --> 00:40:44,173
He's answered my prayers!

459
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:47,754
Céline can't dance with another.
He wants her all for himself.

460
00:40:47,888 --> 00:40:51,346
- Want Céline here?
- Oh, ever so much!

461
00:40:51,491 --> 00:40:54,824
All 4 of you? lt's an invasion!
They'll vote no.

462
00:40:54,962 --> 00:40:58,489
l paved the way. Most will vote yes.

463
00:40:58,632 --> 00:41:01,328
- Then, if l may...
- Speak.

464
00:41:01,501 --> 00:41:03,366
l wish to leave!

465
00:41:03,604 --> 00:41:04,662
Leave us?

466
00:41:04,805 --> 00:41:09,299
l want to go to a Carmel far away,
across the world.

467
00:41:10,344 --> 00:41:12,209
To hide, save from him.

468
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:15,978
l'd miss you. Especially your simplicity.

469
00:41:16,283 --> 00:41:20,447
lt'll shine out of you some day.
l wish to see it.

470
00:41:21,688 --> 00:41:25,283
l need strong, happy girls. Be careful.

471
00:41:25,425 --> 00:41:26,517
l am.

472
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,355
You're burning.

473
00:41:30,797 --> 00:41:32,355
Dear sis,

474
00:41:32,499 --> 00:41:35,900
lf l told you my dream...
You were dying a martyr.

475
00:41:36,603 --> 00:41:39,470
A man dragged you into the woods.

476
00:41:39,606 --> 00:41:43,474
l saw you leave for martyrdom with glee,
l held my breath.

477
00:41:44,044 --> 00:41:47,673
We saw a wisp of smoke rise to the sky.

478
00:41:48,115 --> 00:41:51,482
A bird sang. We said, the sacrifice is over.

479
00:41:51,618 --> 00:41:53,142
Thérèse is a martyr.

480
00:41:54,087 --> 00:41:56,612
My heart beat wildly. And me?

481
00:41:57,391 --> 00:41:59,586
Would l be parted from my sweet Thérèse?

482
00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:02,388
That couldn't be!

483
00:42:02,929 --> 00:42:05,591
Something made me hope to join you
in your happiness.

484
00:42:05,666 --> 00:42:07,463
l was out in the country.

485
00:42:08,168 --> 00:42:10,796
A young cobbler threw himself upon me.

486
00:42:12,005 --> 00:42:14,803
He stuck his awl down my throat.

487
00:42:15,108 --> 00:42:17,804
l was too happy to run away.

488
00:42:18,178 --> 00:42:21,739
But he was too weak, and l didn't die.

489
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:26,383
He got angrier,
and ended up plucking my eyes out.

490
00:42:26,653 --> 00:42:29,588
l collapsed, thinking, more, more...

491
00:42:30,323 --> 00:42:33,019
l wanted more, but l still wasn't dying.

492
00:42:33,293 --> 00:42:36,160
l envied your fate.
Having endured all these horrors....

493
00:42:36,763 --> 00:42:40,426
l woke up, regretting it was only a dream.

494
00:43:01,655 --> 00:43:04,419
l bathed him, shut his eyes. He's beautiful.

495
00:44:00,747 --> 00:44:04,683
l, Sister Thérèse of the child Jesus
and the Holy Face...

496
00:44:06,153 --> 00:44:07,620
solemnly declare...

497
00:44:08,855 --> 00:44:12,120
to promise obedience...

498
00:44:12,292 --> 00:44:15,193
chastity and poverty...

499
00:44:15,662 --> 00:44:17,357
to God our Lord...

500
00:44:17,998 --> 00:44:20,466
to the Holy Virgin of Mount Carmel...

501
00:44:21,034 --> 00:44:24,333
and to you, Mother Superior...

502
00:44:24,638 --> 00:44:26,606
and to those after you...

503
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:28,264
until death.

504
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:39,410
A riddle for a heathen.

505
00:45:39,479 --> 00:45:43,006
T as in...Thérèse.

506
00:45:55,262 --> 00:45:59,699
After our walk, during which Dad
always gave me a little gift...

507
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,331
l came home...

508
00:46:01,468 --> 00:46:05,131
l did my homework,
and the rest of the time...

509
00:46:09,242 --> 00:46:12,541
l hopped around in the garden,
near Father...

510
00:46:12,679 --> 00:46:14,237
because dolls bored me.

511
00:46:16,416 --> 00:46:20,011
And then, on winter evenings,
especially Sundays...

512
00:46:20,186 --> 00:46:24,179
how nice it was, after our game...

513
00:46:44,411 --> 00:46:46,572
She's quite a problem.

514
00:46:46,713 --> 00:46:49,341
Help me. Hurry.

515
00:46:50,317 --> 00:46:52,217
You do nothing for her.

516
00:46:53,486 --> 00:46:55,647
l can't tell her l love her.

517
00:46:57,390 --> 00:46:59,517
Careful, she's capable of anything.

518
00:47:00,593 --> 00:47:03,084
Make her your best bride.

519
00:47:22,582 --> 00:47:24,072
So what?

520
00:48:42,929 --> 00:48:45,193
His left hand touches my head...

521
00:48:45,832 --> 00:48:47,823
the other embraces me.

522
00:48:48,568 --> 00:48:51,366
Downpour cannot extinguish love...

523
00:48:51,971 --> 00:48:53,836
nor floods submerge it.

524
00:48:54,407 --> 00:48:56,534
Downpour cannot extinguish love...

525
00:48:56,676 --> 00:48:58,906
nor floods submerge it.

526
00:49:22,435 --> 00:49:24,665
Only way to cure chilblains.

527
00:49:25,538 --> 00:49:30,339
Christmas, our husband-child's birthday.

528
00:49:30,877 --> 00:49:35,007
We'll embrace one another
and ask for forgiveness.

529
00:49:35,949 --> 00:49:38,679
We must always love and help one another.

530
00:50:13,419 --> 00:50:15,410
- You won't wear them?
- No.

531
00:50:16,523 --> 00:50:17,990
Like little flowers.

532
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:20,690
But l like them.

533
00:50:36,142 --> 00:50:38,975
l have two little candles,
two little messages.

534
00:50:41,748 --> 00:50:44,376
Those messages are a secret, sister Lucy.

535
00:51:04,671 --> 00:51:05,968
Thank you.

536
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:12,043
Sisters!

537
00:51:16,916 --> 00:51:18,440
From the sea!

538
00:51:23,189 --> 00:51:24,588
Are they real?

539
00:51:24,691 --> 00:51:26,556
Yes, they're real!

540
00:51:27,727 --> 00:51:29,661
One for each.

541
00:51:36,169 --> 00:51:37,261
For Carmel.

542
00:51:38,371 --> 00:51:39,861
A man's at the door!

543
00:51:40,907 --> 00:51:42,636
With a heavy trunk.

544
00:51:42,875 --> 00:51:45,070
Of course, show him in.

545
00:51:46,946 --> 00:51:48,345
Put it there.

546
00:51:50,717 --> 00:51:52,514
Who sent this?

547
00:51:53,486 --> 00:51:55,852
l'm not to say.

548
00:51:56,823 --> 00:51:58,120
Thank you.

549
00:51:58,391 --> 00:52:01,792
My cousin Aimée is here.
Can l shake her hand?

550
00:52:02,095 --> 00:52:04,825
Of course. Come here, sister Aimée.

551
00:52:10,570 --> 00:52:12,333
She left me for you, see.

552
00:52:12,472 --> 00:52:15,066
lt was quite a shock. We were engaged.

553
00:52:15,208 --> 00:52:16,232
Quiet.

554
00:52:17,143 --> 00:52:21,375
She sewed a medal of the Virgin
in my jacket.

555
00:52:22,315 --> 00:52:23,839
Secretly. lt's still there.

556
00:52:24,284 --> 00:52:26,047
l'll rip your tongue off!

557
00:52:26,185 --> 00:52:27,516
You've been very kind.

558
00:52:27,654 --> 00:52:29,087
Miss me?

559
00:52:29,355 --> 00:52:31,289
Please leave me alone.

560
00:52:32,425 --> 00:52:35,326
- Merry Christmas, ladies!
- Merry Christmas!

561
00:52:35,461 --> 00:52:36,826
Long live the Republic!

562
00:52:46,506 --> 00:52:50,237
Merry Christmas,
from a carpenter and his wife.

563
00:52:50,376 --> 00:52:53,072
lt's real champagne, it's not cider.

564
00:55:18,524 --> 00:55:20,924
Everyone's looking for you.

565
00:55:21,961 --> 00:55:23,223
The party's not over.

566
00:55:23,996 --> 00:55:26,396
Go away. This is my home.

567
00:55:28,034 --> 00:55:30,025
l can't bear those crazy old hags.

568
00:55:30,336 --> 00:55:31,564
They are treasures.

569
00:55:31,704 --> 00:55:34,070
You and l are the only treasures.

570
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:38,040
Know what they call you? Little sister Amen.

571
00:55:39,145 --> 00:55:42,308
l love you.
l'm your fountain of love, l'm your shadow.

572
00:55:42,448 --> 00:55:44,279
A grain of sand casts no shadow.

573
00:55:44,717 --> 00:55:48,619
Silly. lt's yes to him,
but without you, it's no.

574
00:55:49,722 --> 00:55:51,587
That's my deal.

575
00:55:53,192 --> 00:55:57,151
l came because it's heaven here.
Out there was so ugly.

576
00:55:59,398 --> 00:56:02,390
But why are you in this hole?

577
00:56:02,535 --> 00:56:04,162
lt's my niche.

578
00:56:06,973 --> 00:56:09,498
Stupid bandages!

579
00:56:13,145 --> 00:56:14,737
You two stay apart.

580
00:56:15,515 --> 00:56:18,643
l wasted my time on you, sister Thérèse.

581
00:56:29,428 --> 00:56:31,555
l opened the door to my beloved.

582
00:56:32,598 --> 00:56:35,567
l turned around and he had vanished.

583
00:56:36,435 --> 00:56:39,427
What despair! l fainted.

584
00:56:40,373 --> 00:56:43,399
l looked but couldn't find him.

585
00:56:43,743 --> 00:56:47,702
l called, he didn't answer.

586
00:56:48,247 --> 00:56:52,081
l ran into the night watchmen.

587
00:56:52,418 --> 00:56:54,579
They beat me, they wounded me.

588
00:56:55,755 --> 00:57:00,488
They who guard the ramparts
took off my coat....

589
00:58:21,474 --> 00:58:23,442
This will be my best picture.

590
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:26,075
lt'll go to all the Carmels.

591
01:01:16,315 --> 01:01:17,976
No cause for such alarm.

592
01:01:18,117 --> 01:01:20,244
Get the doctor, please!

593
01:01:20,653 --> 01:01:22,348
l'll think about it.

594
01:01:22,488 --> 01:01:24,513
Now! lt's serious.

595
01:01:25,024 --> 01:01:27,015
Our doctor is gone till Sunday.

596
01:01:27,159 --> 01:01:28,387
He has a replacement.

597
01:01:29,495 --> 01:01:31,292
A beginner. Too young.

598
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:32,658
They say he is good.

599
01:01:32,798 --> 01:01:34,425
l will not let in an unknown.

600
01:01:34,567 --> 01:01:36,262
She's in danger!

601
01:01:36,402 --> 01:01:39,235
Don't insist. That's disobedience. Go!

602
01:01:39,371 --> 01:01:42,397
- l shall inform the Bishop.
- Watch your tone!

603
01:01:42,675 --> 01:01:46,133
Get out! l'm sick of the Martin sisters.

604
01:01:46,612 --> 01:01:49,581
Let election time come
so l'm no longer in charge.

605
01:01:50,416 --> 01:01:52,816
You'll get my job, don't worry.

606
01:02:49,608 --> 01:02:50,802
She's very ill.

607
01:02:51,243 --> 01:02:52,210
She is not.

608
01:02:52,278 --> 01:02:54,712
- The lung is gone.
- l don't believe you.

609
01:02:55,447 --> 01:02:56,846
lt's tuberculosis.

610
01:02:57,516 --> 01:02:58,676
You're wrong.

611
01:02:58,817 --> 01:03:01,786
- Your doctor will confirm.
- He said no such thing.

612
01:03:02,321 --> 01:03:05,757
To each his method. l prefer frankness.

613
01:03:08,193 --> 01:03:10,184
Give her rubdowns.

614
01:03:10,629 --> 01:03:13,723
- Fever cups, morphine shots.
- No way.

615
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:15,826
For the pain.

616
01:03:15,901 --> 01:03:17,095
There's no need.

617
01:03:17,236 --> 01:03:18,225
There is.

618
01:03:18,704 --> 01:03:21,673
- She'll refuse them.
- l'll ask her.

619
01:03:21,907 --> 01:03:24,637
We're on earth to suffer as our husband did.

620
01:03:24,777 --> 01:03:26,301
He suffered only a day.

621
01:03:26,745 --> 01:03:28,770
He's in agony till the world ends.

622
01:03:28,914 --> 01:03:31,348
For you, for me, for all our crimes.

623
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:33,278
Suffering is hideous.

624
01:03:33,686 --> 01:03:34,880
Not here.

625
01:03:35,421 --> 01:03:38,219
They ought to burn this place down.

626
01:03:38,490 --> 01:03:39,923
They probably will.

627
01:03:40,259 --> 01:03:42,193
- How much?
- Nothing. As you know.

628
01:03:47,933 --> 01:03:50,367
- l'll tell her parents.
- They're dead.

629
01:03:50,502 --> 01:03:54,302
- You're dangerous.
- No, the salt of the earth.

630
01:03:58,444 --> 01:03:59,706
Are you dressed?

631
01:03:59,979 --> 01:04:02,174
l have a sheet to finish.

632
01:04:02,481 --> 01:04:04,745
Go back to bed. You remain at the infirmary.

633
01:04:14,893 --> 01:04:17,225
He's not sure what's wrong with you.

634
01:04:18,263 --> 01:04:20,254
He'll wait for our doctor.

635
01:04:32,678 --> 01:04:36,205
Shall l go on writing in the notebook?

636
01:04:36,648 --> 01:04:39,617
The notebook? Yes, fill it up.

637
01:04:41,653 --> 01:04:42,779
l don't even think.

638
01:04:43,489 --> 01:04:45,787
lt's like fishing. l write whatever pops up.

639
01:04:46,558 --> 01:04:49,186
- l look forward to reading it.
- Not what l'm writing now.

640
01:04:49,695 --> 01:04:51,890
Why? ls it gloomy?

641
01:04:52,364 --> 01:04:54,229
l see nothing after this life.

642
01:04:55,567 --> 01:04:57,967
A wall rising to the stars.

643
01:04:59,938 --> 01:05:01,633
Maybe he's mad at me?

644
01:05:02,474 --> 01:05:04,339
He used to make me so happy!

645
01:05:04,476 --> 01:05:06,876
You're just tired, pet. He's faithful.

646
01:05:07,012 --> 01:05:10,607
l'd love a chocolate cake
with custard inside.

647
01:05:10,749 --> 01:05:11,773
A bouché?

648
01:05:11,850 --> 01:05:15,308
Even better. l think it's called an éclair.

649
01:05:16,522 --> 01:05:19,184
Just one, if we can afford it.

650
01:05:27,032 --> 01:05:28,966
She might be contagious.

651
01:05:29,068 --> 01:05:31,127
Let her rest. No visitors.

652
01:05:31,503 --> 01:05:33,596
Especially not sister Lucy.

653
01:05:34,773 --> 01:05:36,365
Very well.

654
01:05:38,410 --> 01:05:40,605
l see nothing after death.

655
01:05:42,648 --> 01:05:44,980
A wall rising to the stars.

656
01:05:47,986 --> 01:05:50,318
Maybe he's mad at me.

657
01:05:52,124 --> 01:05:56,083
Please, if you meet my beloved...

658
01:05:56,929 --> 01:05:59,659
tell him l'm ill with love.

659
01:06:53,352 --> 01:06:56,617
Carry on. l still give the orders here.

660
01:07:02,294 --> 01:07:03,556
What was for lunch?

661
01:07:03,862 --> 01:07:05,295
Rice with herbs.

662
01:07:18,510 --> 01:07:20,501
l love the wide-open spaces.

663
01:07:20,846 --> 01:07:22,837
l love gigantic pine trees.

664
01:07:23,749 --> 01:07:27,742
But is there pure love in my heart?

665
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:50,540
We look for Jesus.

666
01:07:51,176 --> 01:07:52,541
We go to the hospital.

667
01:07:54,246 --> 01:07:57,238
We wash the hands and feet of the sick.

668
01:07:57,382 --> 01:07:59,316
Among them is a leper.

669
01:08:00,385 --> 01:08:03,115
His hands are putrid stumps.

670
01:08:03,255 --> 01:08:04,654
We wash them, too.

671
01:08:05,224 --> 01:08:08,751
Then we drink the water
we used to wash them.

672
01:08:09,394 --> 01:08:14,058
lt floods us so sweetly
that we sail on joy all the way home.

673
01:08:16,134 --> 01:08:20,070
A scaly piece of skin
from the leper's sores...

674
01:08:20,239 --> 01:08:22,173
slips into my mouth.

675
01:08:23,609 --> 01:08:26,669
l don't spit it out. l swallow it.

676
01:08:28,013 --> 01:08:30,345
l feel like l've taken communion.

677
01:08:38,423 --> 01:08:40,414
l share with you.

678
01:08:40,559 --> 01:08:44,017
You can't die or l'll leave.

679
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:49,931
Tear this up.

680
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:07,803
My beloved, you instruct me in silence...

681
01:11:08,774 --> 01:11:10,264
and in darkness.

682
01:11:24,956 --> 01:11:28,414
- Time out. May l talk to you?
- Of course.

683
01:11:28,660 --> 01:11:29,957
You look well.

684
01:11:30,529 --> 01:11:32,258
Thank you.

685
01:11:32,998 --> 01:11:35,466
Maybe you're not as ill as they say.

686
01:11:39,171 --> 01:11:41,036
l'd like something to remember you by.

687
01:11:41,907 --> 01:11:43,101
Take a flower.

688
01:11:43,241 --> 01:11:46,176
No, it'll wither and l'll be sad.

689
01:11:48,346 --> 01:11:49,677
lt's all l have.

690
01:11:50,715 --> 01:11:52,046
A hair?

691
01:11:52,551 --> 01:11:53,711
A fingernail?

692
01:11:57,255 --> 01:11:59,655
Will you forget l didn't like you?

693
01:11:59,991 --> 01:12:02,118
l never thought that.

694
01:12:02,294 --> 01:12:06,355
- Pray for me in heaven?
- lf l go there! l'm still strong!

695
01:12:18,677 --> 01:12:20,736
l can't pray for you.

696
01:12:21,546 --> 01:12:25,607
We all agree,
you deflect the prayers onto others.

697
01:12:26,051 --> 01:12:28,019
You pass on all your gifts.

698
01:12:28,153 --> 01:12:30,678
- So why make me any gifts?
- Right!

699
01:12:32,090 --> 01:12:35,582
You don't have to struggle. lt's easy for you.

700
01:12:35,694 --> 01:12:36,888
You think so?

701
01:12:38,497 --> 01:12:41,432
l'd love to catch you in error. l can't.

702
01:12:42,734 --> 01:12:44,326
l'm just a spiteful old goat.

703
01:12:44,469 --> 01:12:47,267
l'll never change.

704
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:50,471
Don't worry.

705
01:12:50,609 --> 01:12:55,376
At Carmel, the first 30 years are the hardest.

706
01:13:39,090 --> 01:13:41,217
l see only a void.

707
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:43,728
lt's his doing.

708
01:13:44,029 --> 01:13:48,830
He wants me to think heaven doesn't exist.

709
01:13:50,135 --> 01:13:53,593
They warned me
he's even more handsome when he hides.

710
01:13:53,738 --> 01:13:57,401
You must pull yourself out of this!

711
01:13:58,543 --> 01:14:01,410
l'll think of you every day when l say mass.

712
01:14:01,546 --> 01:14:03,173
You will never be alone.

713
01:14:03,315 --> 01:14:04,805
Am l in error?

714
01:14:05,584 --> 01:14:09,315
No. l promise you. l give you absolution.

715
01:14:16,828 --> 01:14:20,286
l am not worthy for you
to come through my door.

716
01:14:20,665 --> 01:14:24,260
Just say a word and l'll be cured.

717
01:14:56,668 --> 01:14:58,795
Do all you can for your sister.

718
01:14:59,771 --> 01:15:02,672
Miss services,
break silence when you have to.

719
01:15:03,375 --> 01:15:04,774
You be the judge.

720
01:15:26,164 --> 01:15:29,190
l'm sorry. l ruined it.

721
01:15:30,568 --> 01:15:31,899
Drink a little.

722
01:15:33,204 --> 01:15:34,671
My mouth isn't dry.

723
01:15:34,806 --> 01:15:38,606
Still depriving yourself!
Whatever you need, you must ask.

724
01:15:39,177 --> 01:15:40,769
Drink in obedience.

725
01:15:47,185 --> 01:15:48,846
You may not find me...

726
01:15:49,454 --> 01:15:51,547
You may not find me tomorrow.

727
01:15:51,690 --> 01:15:53,590
No grief, no handkerchiefs.

728
01:15:54,592 --> 01:15:56,651
He'll have come for me.

729
01:15:56,961 --> 01:15:59,429
- His baby needs him.
- You're not a baby.

730
01:15:59,831 --> 01:16:02,800
Yes, l am. Small enough to stay in his arms.

731
01:16:06,738 --> 01:16:10,765
l'd cross mountains and plains
in search of my loves.

732
01:16:11,376 --> 01:16:13,742
l'd go see the shoots in the valleys...

733
01:16:13,978 --> 01:16:17,709
the budding vine,
the blooming pomegranate trees.

734
01:16:42,373 --> 01:16:43,601
We're off limits.

735
01:16:43,742 --> 01:16:45,300
l was thirsty.

736
01:16:45,510 --> 01:16:46,499
Me, too.

737
01:16:46,644 --> 01:16:49,010
- So hot!
- Record high.

738
01:16:49,147 --> 01:16:50,512
ls sister Thérèse very ill?

739
01:16:50,648 --> 01:16:51,307
Very.

740
01:16:51,449 --> 01:16:52,416
Will she....

741
01:16:53,151 --> 01:16:55,381
Unless there's a miracle, yes.

742
01:16:58,456 --> 01:17:01,550
l dreamt that l escaped from here.

743
01:17:02,494 --> 01:17:05,054
This is not a prison. The door is open.

744
01:17:05,196 --> 01:17:08,757
l traded a violin for a train ticket to Paris.

745
01:17:10,468 --> 01:17:13,028
l am a shepherd. You are my lamb.

746
01:17:13,304 --> 01:17:15,295
l'll do all l can to keep you.

747
01:17:47,438 --> 01:17:49,133
Expensive water from Lourdes.

748
01:17:49,274 --> 01:17:51,139
lf you don't sleep, l won't!

749
01:17:51,276 --> 01:17:52,334
l'm in pain!

750
01:17:52,744 --> 01:17:53,733
Pray!

751
01:17:54,045 --> 01:17:56,172
- l'm praying.
- What are saying to him?

752
01:17:56,648 --> 01:17:58,013
- Nothing.
- And he?

753
01:17:58,149 --> 01:18:00,379
- Nothing.
- Pray louder. He's deaf.

754
01:18:02,187 --> 01:18:06,487
When l say, ''lt hurts,'' you say, ''Good.''

755
01:18:06,624 --> 01:18:07,556
No.

756
01:18:08,026 --> 01:18:09,254
lt hurts.

757
01:18:10,628 --> 01:18:12,061
lt hurts!

758
01:18:14,799 --> 01:18:15,561
Good!

759
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:17,131
- lt hurts!
- Good!

760
01:18:32,951 --> 01:18:35,613
- lt's stopped hurting.
- Good.

761
01:18:37,622 --> 01:18:39,214
lt's stopped.

762
01:19:10,755 --> 01:19:12,689
Can l see her? One second?

763
01:19:13,157 --> 01:19:14,317
No longer.

764
01:19:16,761 --> 01:19:17,785
Sleep.

765
01:19:19,397 --> 01:19:23,561
Sleep, my little blue nestling.

766
01:19:23,768 --> 01:19:25,633
You're going to sleep well.

767
01:19:26,304 --> 01:19:28,829
And so will l, you know.

768
01:19:29,641 --> 01:19:31,666
lt's going to be good.

769
01:22:07,131 --> 01:22:08,530
l'm walking for someone.

770
01:22:09,367 --> 01:22:10,231
Who?

771
01:22:11,602 --> 01:22:12,660
Someone.

772
01:22:13,337 --> 01:22:14,702
You won't say who?

773
01:22:15,139 --> 01:22:15,798
No.

774
01:22:20,244 --> 01:22:21,541
l want to sit there.

775
01:22:26,217 --> 01:22:27,445
For sister Lucy.

776
01:22:27,585 --> 01:22:29,348
lt's plain Lucy now.

777
01:22:55,847 --> 01:22:57,610
Don't you ever stop?

778
01:22:58,282 --> 01:23:00,773
No. We sell them.

779
01:23:05,189 --> 01:23:07,384
l'd like to give you a proof of my love.

780
01:23:21,839 --> 01:23:24,364
No one ever gave you that.

781
01:23:24,675 --> 01:23:26,233
We'll miss you.

782
01:23:29,213 --> 01:23:30,407
l'll send flowers.

783
01:23:52,770 --> 01:23:54,328
She might jump away.

784
01:23:54,505 --> 01:23:55,836
She'll hurt herself.

785
01:23:57,341 --> 01:23:58,706
l'll let her go.

786
01:24:14,525 --> 01:24:15,924
Back together, eh?

787
01:24:16,794 --> 01:24:20,696
Poor thing, he's a bit lonely.

788
01:25:18,623 --> 01:25:21,888
After her death,
Thérèse's notebook was published

789
01:25:22,093 --> 01:25:24,118
and translated in several languages.

790
01:25:24,295 --> 01:25:26,422
Her tomb is often visited.

791
01:25:26,897 --> 01:25:31,493
ln 1925, she was declared a saint
and canonized.

792
