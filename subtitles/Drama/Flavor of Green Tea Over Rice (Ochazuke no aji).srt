25
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,486
Thanks.
- Not at all.

26
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:22,231
What's going on with Miss Taguchi?
This is her second day out.

27
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:25,303
I heard she's getting married.

28
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:29,332
Really?
So she'll be quitting?

29
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:30,601
I don't know.

30
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:33,974
Good for her.
How old is she?

31
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:36,115
Around 23 or 24.

32
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:38,307
Is that so?

33
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:40,977
What does your husband do?

34
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:43,949
- I'm not married yet.
- No?

35
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:46,921
It's just me and my father.

36
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:50,119
I see.
Well, it'll be your turn soon.

37
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,128
I hope you find
a good husband.

38
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,316
Hey there.

39
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:20,793
What is it?

40
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,418
I just happened
to be in Yokohama.

41
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:27,498
I see. Was your wife
angry the other day?

42
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:30,727
Not at all.
She was amused.

43
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:35,567
- Sake makes me too honest.
- You and me both.

44
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:45,708
Tell me, how old
is Michiko now?

45
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:47,580
She's 24. Why?

46
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:50,518
I've found a good prospect.
Interested?

47
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,250
- A prospect?
- For marriage.

48
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:57,123
My wife found him.
She's quite impressed.

49
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:02,530
Fresh out of medical school.
He's an intern there now.

50
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:06,900
About 29, I think she said.
What do you say?

51
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,275
Marriage, huh?

52
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,906
You have other offers?

53
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:16,373
No. I just haven't given it
any thought.

54
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:18,483
Haven't given it any thought?

55
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,642
She's not ready yet.

56
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,755
She's just a child,
quite naive about such things.

57
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:27,620
Oh no, she isn't.
She's more than ready.

58
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:29,386
You think so?

59
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:33,521
Absolutely.
Marry her off. She'll be fine.

60
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,190
Think so?

61
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:38,929
Oh, Horie called earlier.
He wants to talk about the reunion.

62
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:40,072
When?

63
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:43,367
Tonight.
He probably called you too.

64
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:47,673
He's a real fireball
since taking that young wife.

65
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,042
Maybe he's popping some pills.

66
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:52,116
You could be right.

67
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:56,817
Well, think about
what I said about Michiko.

68
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,259
All right.
So will you come tonight?

69
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:04,760
No, I'm here to see
the Whales play the Tigers.

70
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:07,165
It's a doubleheader.

71
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,460
Go some other night.

72
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:13,628
I won't miss a crucial game
just to see Horie.

73
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:16,434
Don't talk like that.
Come on.

74
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:20,037
- Not tonight.
- Come on!

75
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,272
No, not tonight.

76
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,367
It's the bottom
of the fourth inning.

77
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:46,835
The Whales' cleanup batter,
3rd baseman Kuwata, is at bat.

78
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:51,710
Bottom of the fourth.
Kuwata is at bat.

79
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:55,908
With his leg injury healed,
he 's in top form.

80
00:06:56,082 --> 00:07:00,246
He sent a grounder to short
his first time up.

81
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:06,549
He glances at coach Mihara
for the signal.

82
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:09,961
He 's out to nail that ball.

83
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:13,830
Buckey's on the mound,
Tanigawa 's behind the plate.

84
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,629
A fastball from Buckey.
It's a strike.

85
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:20,864
Low in the strike zone.
One strike, no balls.

86
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,372
New signal for the next pitch.

87
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:26,910
It's a ball,
and it's now 1 and 1.

88
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:30,071
Kuwata waits for the pitch.

89
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:34,208
Too high.
The count is 1 and 2.

90
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,195
Did they score a run?

91
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,798
So where'd Sugai
run into him?

92
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:59,039
On the train.

93
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:03,237
He saw a strange old man
reading a discarded newspaper.

94
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:07,452
He looked familiar.
Then Sugai realized it was ""the Gourd"!

95
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:10,789
He must be pretty old by now.

96
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:14,218
I thought he'd died long ago.

97
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:17,287
No, his kind never die.

98
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:22,228
Right?
Not even if you try to kill them.

99
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:24,727
You still bitter?

100
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:27,270
He browbeat you
with the Chinese classics.

101
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:30,574
He was a rat.
Why have a party for him?

102
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:32,210
For the hell of it.

103
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,509
If he's coming, I'm not.

104
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,309
What?
The reunion's in his honor.

105
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:41,112
It won't be fun without you.
Come on.

106
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:42,083
Come on.

107
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:44,086
Absolutely not.

108
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:47,650
Who's ahead?

109
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,322
No change. Tied 0-0.

110
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:52,327
More hot sake.

111
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,328
This one's empty.

112
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,773
Professor Horie,
your wife is late.

113
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:07,875
- Your wife's coming?
- Yes.

114
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,447
- She is?
- That's right.

115
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:13,779
She's visiting friends now,
but she'll be here.

116
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:16,813
Such a lovely young wife.

117
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:22,987
So she goes with you
everywhere these days?

118
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,130
More or less.

119
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:31,132
- You taking anything?
- What?

120
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:32,860
You know.

121
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:36,167
I don't need that yet.

122
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:38,102
It's not necessary.

123
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:40,510
What about you, ma'am?

124
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,204
- What?
- You know.

125
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:47,378
Do you give your husband
pills to... you know...

126
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:49,652
Well, I never!

127
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:53,249
I'll heat some more sake.

128
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:00,989
More?

129
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:08,368
Just between us...

130
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:09,508
What is it?

131
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:12,075
I'm serious now.

132
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:16,208
I won't shout it from the rooftops,
but it's pretty nice.

133
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:17,246
What is?

134
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:22,410
Having a young wife.
It works out quite nicely.

135
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:24,484
Listen to you!

136
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:27,657
No, I'm serious.
It's true.

137
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:29,658
How old is she?

138
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:33,590
Three years older
than my daughter. What of it?

139
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:35,863
Lucky bastard.

140
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:38,560
That's right.
And it's great.

141
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:42,299
Why don't you try it?
Start a new life.

142
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,340
Is it that great?

143
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:49,413
Forget it. Just stay as you are
and marry off your daughter.

144
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:52,817
But in all seriousness -

145
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:55,519
We get it.
Spare us any more.

146
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:57,883
Just between us -

147
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:03,218
Professor Horie,
your wife is here.

148
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:05,493
Really?

149
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:14,796
Come in.

150
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:18,341
Well?
Did you see your friends?

151
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:22,241
Come join us.
- Please do.

152
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:23,915
Welcome.

153
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:28,016
Sorry I haven't been in touch.

154
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:31,354
Not at all.
How have you been?

155
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:36,522
- Please join us.
- Yes, do.

156
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:44,102
Did you finish your shopping?

157
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:46,237
Then come join us.

158
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:48,637
I really ought to...

159
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:52,975
You're going home?
Did you get my medicine?

160
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:56,946
I'll take some now.
- What's it for?

161
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:00,181
It's vitamins.

162
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,185
Why not take them at home?

163
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:09,127
I guess I will.
Should we be leaving?

164
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:11,953
Sorry, but...

165
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:14,163
What about the reunion?

166
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:17,097
I'll leave it to you two.

167
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:18,998
You decide what's best.

168
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,972
Please excuse us.

169
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,800
Take care.

170
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:35,044
You know, I missed
the game to come here.

171
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,180
It's just a game.

172
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,148
Aren't you eating?

173
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,128
I'll eat at home.

174
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:46,326
Well, good night.

175
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:53,505
I'll listen meekly
to any complaints later.

176
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,017
Look at what's
become of him.

177
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,353
What a fool.

178
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:22,056
I wouldn't want
to wind up like that.

179
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:24,192
No, sirree...

180
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:46,123
- Can I lock up?
- Yes.

181
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:52,990
- Welcome home.
- Thanks.

182
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:59,963
- You stink of booze again.
- I didn't have much.

183
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:01,401
I wonder.

184
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:15,282
Father,
did you run into Koichi?

185
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,080
- Was he here?
- He just left.

186
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:19,747
What did he want?

187
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:21,415
Nothing special.

188
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:24,757
But he brought doughnuts.
There's one left.

189
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:25,919
I see.

190
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:27,724
Welcome home.

191
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,892
- Care for a bite to eat?
- I'm fine.

192
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,334
Then I'll have
the last doughnut.

193
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:37,807
Mrs. Tomizawa
won't be coming anymore.

194
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:39,703
How come?

195
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,746
Her sister-in-law died.
She's moving back home.

196
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:45,816
I see.
Did you find a replacement?

197
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:49,614
She asked around
but couldn't find anyone.

198
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:52,655
That's a bother.

199
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:57,023
We'll manage if we all get up early.
You too, Kazu.

200
00:14:57,963 --> 00:15:01,160
Not me. I'm off tomorrow.

201
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:03,662
And I don't leave till noon.

202
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:05,929
So only I'm getting up early?

203
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:09,541
Then you two
can clean up after I leave.

204
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:14,806
And call if you're going
to miss dinner.

205
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,847
You too, Kazu.
Or no dinner for you.

206
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:21,214
Sis, can you get me
my gray trousers?

207
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:24,356
Get them yourself.
They're upstairs.

208
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:28,289
I wonder what Koichi wanted.

209
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:29,924
No idea.

210
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:33,394
Call him.
He should be home by now.

211
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:07,298
I'm back.

212
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:15,703
You're late.

213
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:20,238
I went to see Dad.
Did you get home early?

214
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:23,381
Not really.
What did he say?

215
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:25,606
He wasn't in.

216
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:34,059
Michiko returned this to you.

217
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:37,559
My dress patterns.
Did they turn out well?

218
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:41,166
I don't know.
I'll go see Dad again soon.

219
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,766
Do that.

220
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:46,397
You know Mr. Yamaoka?

221
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,267
- Who?
- On the third floor.

222
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:52,433
The insurance man?

223
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:55,671
Yes. His wife
was in the hospital.

224
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:58,439
She was? Why?

225
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:01,950
She came home
with a darling baby boy.

226
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,089
A baby boy?

227
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:08,219
They're naming him Koichi,
just like you.

228
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:10,294
I asked them not to.

229
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,064
It's a fine name.

230
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:15,097
Not for him.

231
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:19,363
Imagine that poor child
ending up like you.

232
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:23,264
One Koichi is enough.

233
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:30,141
Want grapes?
I bought some tonight.

234
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:31,680
Tomorrow.

235
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,580
I'm tired.
Make my bed.

236
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:38,883
I'm eating!
Make it yourself.

237
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:09,350
We'll get a discount
on the fridge if we pay up front.

238
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:02,431
Michiko.

239
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:05,434
Did your father talk to you?

240
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:06,873
About what?

241
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:10,742
A marriage prospect for you.
A good one, too.

242
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,050
No.

243
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:14,549
He didn't say a word?

244
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:17,752
That man is hopeless.

245
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:22,722
What do you say?
Are you ready to marry?

246
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,289
Tell me.

247
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:28,094
How do you feel about it?

248
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:30,895
Those two are helpless
without me.

249
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:34,232
- Why?
- They just are.

250
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:36,797
If that's the reason,

251
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:41,275
you'll wind up
never getting married.

252
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:43,880
That's fine.

253
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:46,916
It is not fine.

254
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:49,883
You mustn't become
an old maid.

255
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:52,450
Speak to your father.

256
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:00,356
Miss Hirayama.

257
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,398
Is your father attending
the reunion tonight?

258
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:53,982
- You're sure?
- Absolutely. Right?

259
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:56,313
- So you got suspended?
- He sure did.

260
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:59,753
- What was it for that time?
- He wrote a love letter.

261
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,052
And ""the Lion" found it.

262
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:05,990
Sir, how's he doing?

263
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:09,159
The Lion?

264
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:12,899
Mr. Miyamoto,
the math teacher.

265
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:17,735
Ah, he passed away.
He was a nice man.

266
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:22,044
And how's ""the Emperor"?

267
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:25,581
Mr. Tsukamoto,
the history teacher?

268
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:27,582
He's in good health.

269
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:32,656
Lives in Tottori.
Sends me a card every New Year.

270
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:37,024
And Mr. Amano,
who taught physics -

271
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:38,492
""The Badger"?

272
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:40,859
Is that what you called him?

273
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:44,969
His son is a member
of the Upper House.

274
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:47,734
He's comfortably retired.

275
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:51,205
So Mr. Amano's
doing well, eh?

276
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:53,571
Sir, you have a daughter?

277
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:56,270
Yes... I do.

278
00:21:57,115 --> 00:21:59,583
A very pretty girl, too.

279
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,714
You're embarrassing me.

280
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:05,118
How many grandchildren
do you have?

281
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:10,987
Well, you see, my wife
passed away some time ago,

282
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:14,359
so my daughter's still single
and looks after me.

283
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:17,366
It must be kind of lonely
for you two.

284
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:18,867
Not really...

285
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:22,768
But you must all have
adult children by now.

286
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:24,306
Any grandchildren?

287
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:32,778
His new wife
is practically a grandchild.

288
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:36,250
Not only that -
and this is just between us -

289
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:38,218
he says it's ""pretty nice."

290
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:41,848
Really? Congratulations!

291
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:49,930
Mr. Horie, you were vice-president
of your class, weren't you?

292
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:52,796
He's still vice-president.

293
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:56,065
His wife is president!

294
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:00,774
Indeed.

295
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:06,015
Delicious.

296
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:08,953
What is this?

297
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:11,487
- Sea eel.
- Seal?

298
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:13,089
No, sea eel.

299
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:15,055
Ah, sea eel.

300
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,758
It's very tasty.

301
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:24,966
Sea eel, eh?

302
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:31,800
Written with the characters
for ""fish" and ""abundance."

303
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:33,910
More, sir?

304
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,070
Beer? Thank you.

305
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:43,848
It must be lonely,
just you and your daughter.

306
00:23:44,022 --> 00:23:47,958
It is, but I got
used to it long ago.

307
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:51,390
I don't know
how my daughter feels, though.

308
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:56,663
Well, my thanks to you all.
It was a wonderful meal.

309
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:59,895
- A little more?
- Oh, thank you.

310
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:11,148
Yes, it's been most pleasant.

311
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:16,811
It's been 40 years
since you left middle school.

312
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:21,482
You're all important men now,
with busy schedules,

313
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:25,391
yet you generously offer
your valuable time

314
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:28,226
to treat the Gourd
to your hospitality.

315
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,868
How about one more, sir?

316
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,404
Don't mind if I do.

317
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:42,938
People have become
so cold since the war,

318
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:46,515
but the warmth
you've shown me this evening -

319
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:50,013
The Gourd is very lucky.

320
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:51,485
Thank you.

321
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:53,851
Thank you all!

322
00:24:57,195 --> 00:25:00,130
- What is it?
- Where's my hat?

323
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:02,232
Can't you stay a bit?

324
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,368
I'll drive you home later.

325
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:06,766
No, I must be going.

326
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:11,676
Sir, you checked your hat.

327
00:25:12,377 --> 00:25:13,844
Did l?

328
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:16,913
That's right.

329
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:20,876
- You're really leaving?
- I'll just finish this.

330
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:23,520
Please take this with you.

331
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:28,925
Oh, goodness.
Thank you once again.

332
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:30,861
Well, everyone...

333
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:33,623
- I'll go with him too.
- Good idea.

334
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:39,601
Thank you all again.

335
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:47,539
I had a wonderful time.

336
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:55,544
Look after him.
Good-bye.

337
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:05,560
- Are they gone?
- Yes.

338
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,501
I think the Gourd
enjoyed himself.

339
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:16,535
He'd never had sea eel,
but he knew how to write it.

340
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:20,405
He even ate
Kawai's egg custard.

341
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,604
He sure has
a hearty appetite.

342
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:27,546
He certainly has aged.
He's starting to shrivel up.

343
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:34,053
A shriveled gourd, eh?
It was our good turn for the day.

344
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:37,793
- Some more?
- Please.

345
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:41,196
- Any sake left?
- Yes.

346
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:08,823
This is it.
Over this way.

347
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:11,892
- Are you all right, sir?
- I'm fine!

348
00:27:12,063 --> 00:27:13,758
I had a great time!

349
00:27:16,534 --> 00:27:18,593
NOODLE SHOP

350
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:21,098
- The whiskey!
- It's all gone.

351
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:22,398
All gone?

352
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,449
Hey, Tamako!

353
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,943
Please come in.

354
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:42,617
Tamako!

355
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:51,996
What is it, Father?

356
00:27:53,538 --> 00:27:55,768
I had fun!

357
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:00,000
Sorry, he's rather tipsy.

358
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:03,812
- What fun!
- Father!

359
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:06,006
Great fun!

360
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:11,816
Mr. Kawai and Mr. Hirayama
saw me home.

361
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:15,425
I'm terribly sorry
for your trouble.

362
00:28:15,593 --> 00:28:17,561
He's always like this.

363
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:20,823
Shut up!
What's that supposed to mean?

364
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:24,665
What fun. Kawai!

365
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:26,562
Yes?

366
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:29,002
You're a big shot now,

367
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:32,632
but you were an unruly brat.
I underestimated you.

368
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:35,379
Tamako, beer!

369
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:38,476
Please don't bother.

370
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:40,743
But you went out of your way.

371
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:42,978
- Pardon us -
- We must be leaving.

372
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:45,247
Not yet. It's too early.

373
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:47,220
Hey, Hirayama!

374
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:49,653
Hirayama!

375
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:51,295
Father!

376
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:57,030
Where's my bottle?
The classy whiskey.

377
00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:00,194
You finished it in the car.

378
00:29:00,371 --> 00:29:02,339
I did?

379
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:06,803
Oh, that's right. I did.

380
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:11,042
You always did
have a good memory.

381
00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:14,510
Please look after him.

382
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:16,517
We'll be going.

383
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:18,883
I'm terribly sorry
for the trouble.

384
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:21,157
If you'll excuse us.

385
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:23,419
Don't leave yet!

386
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:26,027
Kawai! Hirayama!

387
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:34,336
Tamako, beer!

388
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:54,987
What fun! It was great!

389
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:59,291
Hirayama! Kawai!

390
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:09,665
Not seal - sea eel.

391
00:30:58,957 --> 00:31:00,822
Here you go.

392
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:17,740
Did Sugai know the Gourd
ran a noodle shop?

393
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:22,039
He'd have said so.
It took me by surprise.

394
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:28,919
His daughter's
kind of strange.

395
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:32,420
She's so cold and unfriendly.

396
00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:34,625
No wonder he's lonely.

397
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:37,724
I'd hate to end up like that.

398
00:31:38,796 --> 00:31:40,161
But you will.

399
00:31:40,331 --> 00:31:42,128
No, I won't.

400
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,701
You will. Hurry up
and get Michiko married.

401
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,531
- Think so?
- You bet.

402
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:49,866
I'll be fine.

403
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:55,871
More beer for you gentlemen?

404
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:59,483
That's all right.
We have to get back to work.

405
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:04,785
Isn't Professor Horie
coming today?

406
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:08,288
What a lovely young wife!

407
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:11,758
Yes, she's adorable.
Isn't she?

408
00:32:13,731 --> 00:32:15,858
I said,
"Isn't it deplorable?"

409
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:18,728
Yeah, it is.

410
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:21,863
Did something happen?

411
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,371
The wake.

412
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:24,800
For whom?

413
00:32:24,976 --> 00:32:26,910
For whom? For Horie!

414
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:28,545
Don't be silly.

415
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:33,082
Today's an inauspicious day,
so the funeral will be tomorrow.

416
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:35,315
Are you serious?

417
00:32:35,486 --> 00:32:38,284
We were just making
plans for the funeral.

418
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:41,152
Let's not accept any wreaths.

419
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:44,489
No, they're a waste.
No wreaths.

420
00:32:45,396 --> 00:32:47,125
How did he die?

421
00:32:48,866 --> 00:32:51,801
He had high blood pressure.

422
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,598
That young wife
proved to be his undoing.

423
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,373
Are you serious?

424
00:32:58,276 --> 00:33:01,768
You be careful too.
You mustn't overdo it.

425
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:06,611
You two are awful.
He just walked in.

426
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:10,884
Welcome.
They're inside.

427
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:17,594
Sorry I'm late.

428
00:33:19,263 --> 00:33:20,560
What a relief.

429
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:22,632
I'm glad you're alive
and kicking.

430
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:24,858
What?

431
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,164
Still alive, eh?

432
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,536
What?

433
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:34,405
Inside joke.

434
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:42,752
By the way,
they all agreed.

435
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:46,117
They did? That's great.

436
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:50,624
Even those who couldn't attend
are willing to contribute.

437
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:55,494
At 2,000 yen per head,
that'll make 20,000.

438
00:33:55,666 --> 00:33:58,430
- Shall we do that?
- Yes, let's.

439
00:33:58,803 --> 00:34:02,000
- Will you deliver it?
- Me?

440
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:08,074
You live closest to him.
The Gourd will be pleased.

441
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:11,977
I never would've thought
he lived in a place like that.

442
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:14,641
That's fate for you.

443
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,953
Look what it did for me.

444
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:19,150
Stop bragging.

445
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:22,826
May l?

446
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:27,627
It's good.

447
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,611
I'll leave the money here.

448
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,410
Thank you.

449
00:35:26,557 --> 00:35:29,025
- Excuse me.
- Who's that?

450
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:33,521
Sorry about the other night.

451
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:39,532
Thank you so much
for bringing him home.

452
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:44,232
Not at all. I live close by.
Is he in?

453
00:35:44,408 --> 00:35:45,807
Yes, he is.

454
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,377
Father.

455
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:55,316
Well, look who's here!

456
00:35:57,455 --> 00:35:59,480
Please have a seat.

457
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:08,057
- Mr. Hirayama!
- Thanks for coming the other night.

458
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:11,696
The pleasure was all mine.

459
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:17,904
I'm sorry I got carried away
and behaved quite rudely.

460
00:36:18,075 --> 00:36:20,635
My daughter gave me
a good scolding.

461
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:24,110
Please accept
my humble apologies.

462
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:27,012
Not at all.
It was our fault.

463
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:32,554
After 40 long years!
I must say I enjoyed myself.

464
00:36:37,094 --> 00:36:38,959
Please have some.

465
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:44,365
Bring out some shochu.

466
00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:45,967
Wouldn't beer be better?

467
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:49,339
Would you prefer beer?

468
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:53,100
This is fine.
Please don't bother.

469
00:36:53,578 --> 00:36:55,603
No bother.
Bring some out.

470
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,613
No, really.
Please don't bother.

471
00:36:58,783 --> 00:37:02,082
We have so little to offer,

472
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:06,989
especially to a man
of your refined tastes.

473
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:09,649
Please, you really
mustn't bother.

474
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:13,596
Can I make you something?

475
00:37:13,764 --> 00:37:15,994
No, thank you.

476
00:37:20,137 --> 00:37:25,575
Actually, we all just wanted
to give you this.

477
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:28,200
What is it?

478
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:32,381
We considered
a souvenir, but -

479
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:36,281
No, no!
I can't accept it.

480
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:39,480
That would be very awkward.
It's not much.

481
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:41,386
Please take it.

482
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:43,686
No, I couldn't.

483
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:48,298
Just being invited
to your party was enough.

484
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:50,457
Welcome.

485
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:55,531
Pork ramen.

486
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:58,609
Excuse me a moment.

487
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:08,215
I should be going, sir.

488
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:11,549
I see. I'm sorry
you went to such trouble.

489
00:38:11,722 --> 00:38:14,088
- I'll come again.
- Please do.

490
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:16,158
If you'll pardon me.

491
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:19,624
Captain!
Is that you, sir?

492
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:24,190
I'm sorry,
but who would you be?

493
00:38:24,368 --> 00:38:29,396
Petty Officer 1st Class
Sakamoto, sir.

494
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:33,502
Oh, Sakamoto!
Now I remember.

495
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:39,181
He was the captain
of my destroyer.

496
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:42,452
You don't say.

497
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:46,021
That's right.
You went to the naval academy.

498
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,953
That's right.

499
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:50,650
It's been so long.

500
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:54,088
How about joining me
for a drink, Captain?

501
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:56,392
Pops, cancel my order.

502
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:59,001
The food here isn't that good.
Right?

503
00:39:00,137 --> 00:39:02,867
Let's go somewhere.

504
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,736
I'm glad to see you're well.

505
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:07,571
Thank you, sir.

506
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:10,509
I run an auto repair shop nearby.

507
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:13,115
You have to stop by
for a minute.

508
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:15,081
What do you say?
Please.

509
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:17,743
Very well,
if you don't mind.

510
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:20,447
Please do.
See you, Pops.

511
00:39:20,624 --> 00:39:23,923
- Thanks for coming.
- See you again soon.

512
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:37,366
Sir, how come we lost the war?

513
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:39,526
Good question.

514
00:40:44,408 --> 00:40:46,842
It sure made things tough.

515
00:40:47,077 --> 00:40:49,910
I came home
to a burned-down house,

516
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,447
nothing to eat,
and sky-high prices.

517
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:55,852
Could you turn that off?

518
00:40:56,454 --> 00:41:01,790
I borrowed from my father-in-law
to start the shop.

519
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:04,484
Business isn't bad.

520
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:07,654
Is the girl I met at your house
your only child?

521
00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:12,132
No, I have an older daughter,
but I married her off.

522
00:41:12,503 --> 00:41:16,906
I'll be a grandpa any day now.
Not a moment to rest.

523
00:41:17,074 --> 00:41:19,872
I'll bet things
were easier for you, sir.

524
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:22,376
No, I had a hard time too

525
00:41:22,546 --> 00:41:26,880
until friends found me this job.

526
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:32,311
But Captain...

527
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:35,254
if Japan had won the war,
how would things be?

528
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:37,155
I wonder...

529
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:41,722
More whiskey!
Bring us the whole bottle.

530
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:48,963
If we'd won,
we'd both be in New York now.

531
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:53,235
And not just a pachinko parlor
called New York. The real thing!

532
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:55,503
- Think so?
- Absolutely.

533
00:41:56,514 --> 00:42:00,541
Because we lost,
our kids dance around

534
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:03,380
and shake their rumps
to American records.

535
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:06,717
But if we had won,

536
00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:10,725
the blue-eyed ones
would have chignon hairdos

537
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:15,332
and chew gum while plunking
tunes on the shamisen.

538
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:17,664
But I think it's good we lost.

539
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:19,462
You think?

540
00:42:20,504 --> 00:42:23,473
Yeah... maybe you're right.

541
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:29,108
The dumb militarists
can't bully us anymore.

542
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:33,011
I don't mean you, Captain.
You weren't like that.

543
00:42:34,919 --> 00:42:37,854
Have some more.
Bottoms up.

544
00:42:46,096 --> 00:42:47,495
Welcome back.

545
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:50,727
Welcome.

546
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:53,699
Where have you been?

547
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:56,601
- At the baths.
- At this hour?

548
00:42:56,774 --> 00:43:00,335
It's been a slow day.
Shall I pour for you?

549
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:02,274
You're prettier on slow days.

550
00:43:02,446 --> 00:43:04,744
Captain,
she's the madam here.

551
00:43:06,784 --> 00:43:08,149
Welcome.

552
00:43:08,652 --> 00:43:10,586
Seems you come here often.

553
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:13,086
Often enough.
I hope you will too.

554
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:15,657
He was the captain of my ship.

555
00:43:15,826 --> 00:43:17,293
Nice to meet you.

556
00:43:17,461 --> 00:43:19,656
Shall I play that song?

557
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:22,697
Again? Sure, put it on.

558
00:43:22,866 --> 00:43:25,300
Sir, let's drink up!

559
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:29,004
I'm so happy.

560
00:43:32,743 --> 00:43:34,210
Here we go!

561
00:43:43,387 --> 00:43:46,686
Come on, Captain!
Join me!

562
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,371
No, like this!

563
00:44:36,373 --> 00:44:39,399
""Today's weather:
clear skies and rough seas."

564
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:57,525
- Welcome home.
- Thanks.

565
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:03,366
- Koichi's here.
- Oh?

566
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:06,367
- You've been drinking again.
- I didn't have much.

567
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:07,663
Yes, you did.

568
00:45:10,941 --> 00:45:13,136
Welcome home.

569
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:15,002
In high spirits?

570
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:18,342
I ran into an oddball friend.

571
00:45:18,515 --> 00:45:21,245
There's no dinner.
You didn't call.

572
00:45:21,418 --> 00:45:23,045
I've eaten.

573
00:45:24,788 --> 00:45:26,517
I also met a woman.

574
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:27,679
Where?

575
00:45:27,858 --> 00:45:31,885
At a small bar.
She looked just like your mother.

576
00:45:32,596 --> 00:45:33,858
You mean her face?

577
00:45:34,031 --> 00:45:38,400
Her build too,
but not if you look too closely.

578
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:43,268
When she looks down,
this part looks similar.

579
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,873
Really?

580
00:45:45,876 --> 00:45:47,173
How old is she?

581
00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:49,005
Maybe 28, 29.

582
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:52,410
When Mom was that age,
I wasn't born yet.

583
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,778
She wore an odd dress
and headband.

584
00:45:54,952 --> 00:45:56,920
Is that how Mom dressed?

585
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:59,817
No, she always wore
a kimono.

586
00:46:00,724 --> 00:46:06,026
But during the evacuation
she even wore Father's trousers.

587
00:46:07,531 --> 00:46:10,523
I'd like to visit that bar.
Where is it?

588
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:12,692
Yes, let's go one day.

589
00:46:13,203 --> 00:46:15,569
Mind you,
she's no spitting image.

590
00:46:16,907 --> 00:46:18,204
I'll go too.

591
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:22,403
Not me.
I'd rather not see her.

592
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:28,242
What brings you here?

593
00:46:29,353 --> 00:46:32,584
Well, um...

594
00:46:32,756 --> 00:46:35,748
I see.
Michiko, is the bath ready?

595
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,821
I didn't heat it today.

596
00:46:37,995 --> 00:46:39,292
Really?

597
00:46:55,746 --> 00:46:57,111
What is it?

598
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:02,782
I need 50,000 yen
to buy a refrigerator.

599
00:47:02,953 --> 00:47:06,582
Sure, but not right away.
Is it urgent?

600
00:47:06,757 --> 00:47:08,349
The sooner the better.

601
00:47:08,525 --> 00:47:10,789
Michiko will bring it over
in a day or two.

602
00:47:10,961 --> 00:47:12,758
Thank you.

603
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:25,039
Michiko, I need soap.

604
00:47:58,475 --> 00:48:01,569
Would you have
a couple extra tomatoes?

605
00:48:01,745 --> 00:48:03,076
Sure.

606
00:48:06,149 --> 00:48:09,277
How's this vacuum cleaner?

607
00:48:09,453 --> 00:48:11,387
It works well.

608
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,391
Here. They're cold.

609
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:21,258
Thanks.
We ordered a refrigerator.

610
00:48:21,431 --> 00:48:25,162
Don't rush. New models
come out all the time.

611
00:48:25,335 --> 00:48:27,963
You're right.
Well, thanks.

612
00:48:57,734 --> 00:48:59,201
Get home early?

613
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:01,400
No, I just got in.

614
00:49:01,905 --> 00:49:03,099
What's that?

615
00:49:05,842 --> 00:49:07,139
Have a look.

616
00:49:08,245 --> 00:49:10,008
Why'd you buy those?

617
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:13,513
- Did Michiko bring the money?
- No, not yet.

618
00:49:13,684 --> 00:49:14,946
Really?

619
00:49:25,662 --> 00:49:27,789
Why'd you get those?

620
00:49:29,566 --> 00:49:31,033
They're a bargain.

621
00:49:31,368 --> 00:49:32,665
You bought them?

622
00:49:32,836 --> 00:49:34,736
I can pay later.

623
00:49:35,238 --> 00:49:39,800
Miura's friend got new ones
and wants to sell these.

624
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:42,775
They're great clubs.
A real bargain.

625
00:49:43,513 --> 00:49:45,208
You're going to buy them?

626
00:49:49,052 --> 00:49:52,249
With what money?
I won't allow it.

627
00:49:52,422 --> 00:49:56,586
Michiko's bringing money over.
I asked for a little extra.

628
00:49:57,961 --> 00:50:01,055
- How much are you borrowing?
- 50,000 yen.

629
00:50:01,231 --> 00:50:03,927
You still shouldn't
spend it on such things.

630
00:50:04,101 --> 00:50:07,332
All you do is squander money.

631
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:09,798
No, I don't.

632
00:50:09,973 --> 00:50:12,498
You're always buying things.

633
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:17,045
I want to buy things too,
but I control myself.

634
00:50:17,214 --> 00:50:19,011
Take them back.

635
00:50:21,218 --> 00:50:22,947
I can't now.

636
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,748
Yes, you can.
Take them back.

637
00:50:29,092 --> 00:50:34,120
Where do you get off,
playing golf on your salary?

638
00:50:35,098 --> 00:50:37,999
The rare days you come home early,
you're exhausted.

639
00:50:38,935 --> 00:50:42,735
You go straight to bed.
So why buy golf clubs?

640
00:50:43,073 --> 00:50:44,938
Give it up!

641
00:51:42,866 --> 00:51:44,959
On the mark every time.

642
00:51:45,135 --> 00:51:46,796
They're good clubs.

643
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:48,904
They're MacGregors.

644
00:51:54,811 --> 00:51:58,269
A little worn,
but they're still a bargain.

645
00:51:58,448 --> 00:51:59,574
I know.

646
00:51:59,749 --> 00:52:03,116
I wish I could buy them,
but I'm broke.

647
00:52:04,888 --> 00:52:07,857
Ask Shiokawa.
He'll want them.

648
00:52:08,558 --> 00:52:09,582
You don't?

649
00:52:10,026 --> 00:52:13,723
I do, but I have
money problems.

650
00:52:13,897 --> 00:52:15,626
Your wife objects?

651
00:52:16,867 --> 00:52:19,927
But these are MacGregors.

652
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:24,898
- Yeah, they're great.
- Take the plunge.

653
00:52:25,509 --> 00:52:26,908
I'd better not.

654
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:29,105
Is your wife that scary?

655
00:52:29,279 --> 00:52:32,271
No, but I'll never
hear the end of it.

656
00:52:32,749 --> 00:52:34,717
Let me try them again.

657
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:41,181
We don't have much time.

658
00:52:41,858 --> 00:52:43,655
We're fine.

659
00:54:19,489 --> 00:54:23,220
Wind the clock.
It's about to stop.

660
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:34,234
Why are you sulking?

661
00:54:34,638 --> 00:54:39,075
Go play golf if you want.
I never said you couldn't play.

662
00:54:43,213 --> 00:54:48,480
You're like a spoiled kid.
Earn more if you want to spend so much.

663
00:54:52,055 --> 00:54:53,579
No comment?

664
00:54:59,162 --> 00:55:00,629
The clock!

665
00:55:37,534 --> 00:55:39,001
Hello.

666
00:55:40,537 --> 00:55:43,028
Welcome.
Nice day, isn't it?

667
00:55:43,206 --> 00:55:44,673
Come in.

668
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:54,650
I'm glad you're in.
I thought you'd be golfing.

669
00:55:55,585 --> 00:55:59,214
Your brother's ruining our Sunday
with his bad mood.

670
00:56:00,924 --> 00:56:01,891
Why?

671
00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:04,487
Ask him.

672
00:56:06,963 --> 00:56:08,225
What's wrong?

673
00:56:10,166 --> 00:56:12,828
Father sent this for you.

674
00:56:13,103 --> 00:56:15,071
I'll take that.

675
00:56:15,672 --> 00:56:17,139
Thank you.

676
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:24,441
Seriously, what's wrong?

677
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:27,243
He can't use this money
the way he wants.

678
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:28,843
Be quiet.

679
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:34,188
He had his eye on something,
so he borrowed a little extra.

680
00:56:34,357 --> 00:56:35,415
Quiet!

681
00:56:35,592 --> 00:56:37,787
- Trouble was -
- Shut up!

682
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:00,075
Hello.

683
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:01,979
Welcome.

684
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:04,749
Koichi, Mr. Miura's here.

685
00:57:09,025 --> 00:57:10,549
Hi. What's up?

686
00:57:10,727 --> 00:57:13,560
It's about the clubs.
My friend says -

687
00:57:15,665 --> 00:57:17,895
Hello. What is it?

688
00:57:18,067 --> 00:57:22,470
My friend expects you to buy
the clubs as promised.

689
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:26,405
We don't want them.
But do come in.

690
00:57:27,911 --> 00:57:29,503
Come in.

691
00:57:29,712 --> 00:57:31,612
You sure? Okay.

692
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:52,568
I'm afraid my friend was
really counting on the money.

693
00:57:52,735 --> 00:57:55,033
Are you trying to force us?

694
00:57:55,205 --> 00:57:58,265
Not at all!
They're excellent clubs.

695
00:57:58,441 --> 00:58:01,171
And he'll accept installments.

696
00:58:01,344 --> 00:58:02,504
Really?

697
00:58:02,679 --> 00:58:05,648
Not even on installments.
Absolutely not.

698
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:08,049
Are you sure?

699
00:58:08,218 --> 00:58:10,846
¥2,000 a month for 10 months.
It's a steal.

700
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:13,079
Absolutely not.

701
00:58:13,256 --> 00:58:15,952
I'd buy them if I were you.

702
00:58:16,125 --> 00:58:17,592
Then why don't you?

703
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:20,695
I can't.
I don't have the money.

704
00:58:20,864 --> 00:58:24,766
Then stop pushing them on us.
Take them back.

705
00:58:24,934 --> 00:58:26,162
Are you sure?

706
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:32,205
Sorry I upset your wife.

707
00:58:32,375 --> 00:58:36,141
Forget it. She's been
in a bad mood all day.

708
00:58:36,312 --> 00:58:37,870
Still, I'm sorry.

709
00:58:43,319 --> 00:58:44,786
Here.

710
00:58:47,223 --> 00:58:49,851
The first installment.
- Are you sure?

711
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:51,288
Yes.

712
00:58:51,461 --> 00:58:53,827
If we don't buy them,
he'll sulk forever.

713
00:58:55,398 --> 00:58:57,161
Isn't that nice, Koichi?

714
00:59:00,069 --> 00:59:03,197
- They're great clubs.
- Yes, really tops.

715
00:59:03,973 --> 00:59:05,440
You're sure about this?

716
00:59:05,608 --> 00:59:07,872
And remember:
only nine installments left.

717
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:10,672
Don't worry.
Well, I've gotta go.

718
00:59:10,847 --> 00:59:13,247
- So soon?
- Take the money and run, eh?

719
00:59:13,416 --> 00:59:15,281
I have another appointment.

720
00:59:17,787 --> 00:59:19,345
I'll be going too.

721
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:21,683
You too?

722
00:59:21,858 --> 00:59:23,849
Stay a little longer.

723
00:59:24,027 --> 00:59:26,894
I can't.
I'm meeting some friends.

724
00:59:28,498 --> 00:59:30,329
My regards to Dad.

725
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:32,627
And thank him too.

726
00:59:35,805 --> 00:59:37,432
We can walk out together.

727
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:39,564
Good-bye.

728
00:59:40,176 --> 00:59:42,201
Good-bye.

729
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:04,232
You sure about this?

730
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:08,637
Don't you want them?

731
01:00:08,805 --> 01:00:12,172
Yes. I really do.

732
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,976
But I get
to buy something too.

733
01:00:16,245 --> 01:00:18,907
- What?
- A leather handbag.

734
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:23,608
It's expensive,
but I'm buying it!

735
01:01:09,799 --> 01:01:12,290
He's quite a meek husband,
isn't he?

736
01:01:13,636 --> 01:01:16,070
But he acts tough
in front of us.

737
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:18,869
Maybe it's best
to be meek with one's wife.

738
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:22,175
Perhaps,
but not too meek.

739
01:01:22,545 --> 01:01:24,513
Really?
You're hard to figure out.

740
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:29,515
The train's coming.

741
01:02:19,335 --> 01:02:21,235
Hello. What is it?

742
01:02:23,539 --> 01:02:26,804
I wanted to thank you
for everything.

743
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:28,873
Oh, that's right.

744
01:02:29,045 --> 01:02:31,479
I hear you're getting married.
Congratulations.

745
01:02:32,949 --> 01:02:34,246
I wanted to say good-bye.

746
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:38,247
I see.
Say, are you 23 now or 24?

747
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:39,615
I'm 24.

748
01:02:39,956 --> 01:02:43,221
Then you're my daughter's age.

749
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:46,993
Well, be happy.
Be a good wife.

750
01:02:47,363 --> 01:02:48,796
Thank you.

751
01:03:02,979 --> 01:03:05,470
This gentleman
is here for you.

752
01:03:06,816 --> 01:03:10,479
I see.
Please show him in.

753
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:21,123
Miss Taguchi, please stop in again
before you leave.

754
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:23,663
I'll do that. Excuse me.

755
01:03:43,786 --> 01:03:45,310
Welcome.

756
01:03:45,988 --> 01:03:50,448
You must be busy.
Forgive me for coming unannounced.

757
01:03:50,626 --> 01:03:52,457
Not at all.
Please have a seat.

758
01:03:52,628 --> 01:03:56,291
It was nice of you to visit us.

759
01:03:56,465 --> 01:03:59,127
I found your gift
under the chopstick stand.

760
01:03:59,302 --> 01:04:02,032
Don't mention it.
Please sit down.

761
01:04:03,372 --> 01:04:05,897
I don't deserve
such generosity.

762
01:04:06,075 --> 01:04:08,305
Don't be silly.
Please have a seat.

763
01:04:15,818 --> 01:04:20,846
I've been visiting all of you
to thank you for your kindness.

764
01:04:21,023 --> 01:04:24,322
That's nice of you.
Did you see Kawai?

765
01:04:24,493 --> 01:04:27,690
Unfortunately, he was out.

766
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:31,857
I see.
Are you going home now?

767
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:36,300
Yes, this happens
to be my last stop.

768
01:04:36,472 --> 01:04:38,997
Then let's go home together.

769
01:04:39,175 --> 01:04:42,167
All right, but your work -

770
01:04:42,345 --> 01:04:44,176
No, I'm all done.

771
01:04:53,422 --> 01:04:58,189
Get me Mr. Kawai
at Daiwa Trading.

772
01:04:58,394 --> 01:05:03,593
And please send
Miss Taguchi in again, please.

773
01:05:28,691 --> 01:05:30,318
Thank you.

774
01:05:46,342 --> 01:05:50,176
Sir, how about another glass?

775
01:05:50,346 --> 01:05:51,870
Thanks.

776
01:05:59,422 --> 01:06:01,447
I'm happy.

777
01:06:04,327 --> 01:06:06,227
I'm so happy!

778
01:06:08,097 --> 01:06:10,395
Sorry for the trouble.

779
01:06:13,869 --> 01:06:16,497
The Gourd is out cold.

780
01:06:21,043 --> 01:06:23,534
Sir, how about one more?

781
01:06:23,779 --> 01:06:25,406
Yes, thank you.

782
01:06:30,853 --> 01:06:33,413
You gentlemen are fortunate.

783
01:06:33,589 --> 01:06:35,580
I'm so lonely.

784
01:06:35,758 --> 01:06:39,091
Why are you lonely?

785
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:44,296
Lonely and sad.

786
01:06:45,601 --> 01:06:48,331
In the end,
we spend our lives alone...

787
01:06:48,504 --> 01:06:51,234
all alone.

788
01:06:59,382 --> 01:07:03,409
I made a big mistake.

789
01:07:04,086 --> 01:07:07,146
My selfishness ruined her life.

790
01:07:07,823 --> 01:07:09,085
What do you mean?

791
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:12,289
I mean my daughter.

792
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:17,856
My daughter.
I kept her by my side.

793
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:23,094
She had her chances to marry,
but I was a widower.

794
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:26,239
That was my mistake.

795
01:07:26,509 --> 01:07:28,841
I let the opportunities slip by.

796
01:07:29,645 --> 01:07:32,239
I must be going.

797
01:07:32,948 --> 01:07:34,245
Going home?

798
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:38,983
What's the rush?
Let's have another.

799
01:07:39,155 --> 01:07:41,851
Well, perhaps I just might.

800
01:07:44,527 --> 01:07:47,985
""Make hay while the sun shines."

801
01:07:50,099 --> 01:07:53,500
""Waste not your thoughts
on eternity."

802
01:07:53,669 --> 01:07:57,537
""Drain your glass
ere life is gone."

803
01:08:03,579 --> 01:08:04,978
Sir.

804
01:08:07,850 --> 01:08:12,219
Let him sleep.
He leads such a lonely life.

805
01:08:18,794 --> 01:08:21,695
Be careful you don't
end up like that.

806
01:08:21,864 --> 01:08:23,832
Oh, I won't.

807
01:08:25,367 --> 01:08:28,359
What if Michiko turns out
like the Gourd's daughter?

808
01:08:28,537 --> 01:08:30,971
No, she won't.

809
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:32,471
She could.

810
01:08:32,641 --> 01:08:34,609
Hurry up and marry her off,

811
01:08:34,777 --> 01:08:37,507
or you'll end up like the Gourd.

812
01:08:37,847 --> 01:08:40,213
What? The Gourd?

813
01:08:41,584 --> 01:08:43,484
Where am l?

814
01:08:43,652 --> 01:08:47,486
Get some rest, sir.
We'll take you home.

815
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:53,353
Are you Mr. Kawai?

816
01:09:01,537 --> 01:09:03,334
Think it over.

817
01:09:40,342 --> 01:09:41,707
Father?

818
01:09:41,877 --> 01:09:43,640
Yes. I'm back.

819
01:09:43,812 --> 01:09:46,713
Don't lock the door.
Kazu isn't home yet.

820
01:09:57,493 --> 01:09:58,960
Welcome home.

821
01:10:03,566 --> 01:10:05,056
What is it?

822
01:10:18,614 --> 01:10:19,672
Listen.

823
01:10:20,983 --> 01:10:22,245
What?

824
01:10:22,418 --> 01:10:24,511
You ready to get married?

825
01:10:26,488 --> 01:10:29,013
Marriage.
Are you ready?

826
01:10:29,291 --> 01:10:30,986
Don't be silly.

827
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:33,557
I mean it.

828
01:10:34,129 --> 01:10:35,357
I'm serious.

829
01:10:36,131 --> 01:10:38,622
Father, you're drunk again.

830
01:10:38,934 --> 01:10:42,426
I did have a few drinks,
but I'm serious.

831
01:10:43,539 --> 01:10:46,030
Probably more than a few.

832
01:10:47,543 --> 01:10:49,534
What put that idea
into your head?

833
01:10:49,712 --> 01:10:52,306
Lots of things.

834
01:10:52,548 --> 01:10:53,879
Come here.

835
01:10:55,050 --> 01:10:56,745
Just a minute.

836
01:10:57,786 --> 01:10:59,515
I'm almost finished.

837
01:11:00,923 --> 01:11:05,257
I've given it a lot of thought.
Please come here.

838
01:11:23,646 --> 01:11:26,114
How would you two get by?

839
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:29,308
That can't be helped.

840
01:11:30,252 --> 01:11:31,981
You're 24 now.

841
01:11:32,154 --> 01:11:34,645
Precisely.
I still have time.

842
01:11:34,823 --> 01:11:39,624
Before you know it,
it'll be too late.

843
01:11:41,363 --> 01:11:45,925
I've taken advantage
of your willingness to stay and help.

844
01:11:46,101 --> 01:11:47,864
What difference does that make?

845
01:11:48,037 --> 01:11:51,837
I have no intention
of getting married anytime soon.

846
01:11:52,007 --> 01:11:56,171
It's impossible.
You know that as well as I do.

847
01:11:56,578 --> 01:11:57,636
What?

848
01:11:57,813 --> 01:12:00,008
You want me to stay here.

849
01:12:00,182 --> 01:12:02,673
Don't say that.
It's not true.

850
01:12:02,851 --> 01:12:04,375
Yes, it is.

851
01:12:04,553 --> 01:12:07,113
What would you and Kazu do?

852
01:12:07,289 --> 01:12:08,654
We'd get by.

853
01:12:08,824 --> 01:12:11,850
How? You'd never manage.

854
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:15,687
What brought this on?

855
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:18,493
So you never intend to marry?

856
01:12:18,667 --> 01:12:22,125
I never said
I don't intend to marry.

857
01:12:23,405 --> 01:12:28,172
Lots of my friends are married.
Some are already mothers.

858
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:30,608
Then it's time for you -

859
01:12:30,779 --> 01:12:33,077
No.
I'm fine like this.

860
01:12:33,916 --> 01:12:38,444
I realize that
these are our best years,

861
01:12:38,620 --> 01:12:42,954
but you mustn't let them slip by.
I've thought about it.

862
01:12:43,125 --> 01:12:45,992
Then stop being
so inconsiderate.

863
01:12:46,161 --> 01:12:47,458
I'm not!

864
01:12:47,629 --> 01:12:49,187
Yes, you are!

865
01:13:10,619 --> 01:13:11,950
I'm back.

866
01:13:12,688 --> 01:13:14,588
Sis, can I lock up?

867
01:13:15,057 --> 01:13:17,184
Yes, go ahead.

868
01:13:32,808 --> 01:13:35,140
Dad, you're home already?

869
01:13:35,978 --> 01:13:37,843
Where's Sis?
- She's around.

870
01:13:38,881 --> 01:13:41,315
Sis, I'd like dinner.

871
01:13:46,755 --> 01:13:48,450
What's going on?

872
01:14:02,971 --> 01:14:05,997
You think there might be
a man she likes?

873
01:14:07,976 --> 01:14:08,965
Probably.

874
01:14:09,144 --> 01:14:10,042
Really?

875
01:14:10,212 --> 01:14:12,146
I don't know,
but there's a girl I like.

876
01:14:12,314 --> 01:14:13,747
There is?

877
01:14:13,916 --> 01:14:16,612
Yes. Tomiko Shimizu.

878
01:14:16,785 --> 01:14:18,116
Where's she from?

879
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:21,814
I don't know,
but I talk to her sometimes.

880
01:14:23,659 --> 01:14:25,058
What does she do?

881
01:14:25,227 --> 01:14:28,890
She's a conductor on my bus.

882
01:14:29,064 --> 01:14:32,625
She's tiny, plump, and cute.

883
01:14:34,636 --> 01:14:36,103
I see.

884
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:42,872
Hey, Sis,
get me something to eat.

885
01:14:44,546 --> 01:14:47,447
Go make yourself
something in the kitchen.

886
01:14:49,451 --> 01:14:50,475
Why?

887
01:14:50,652 --> 01:14:53,519
Go on.
Take care of yourself.

888
01:16:02,057 --> 01:16:03,490
I'm back.

889
01:16:07,696 --> 01:16:09,596
Sorry I'm late.

890
01:16:10,299 --> 01:16:11,766
What's for dinner?

891
01:16:14,036 --> 01:16:16,766
I found ham and eggs
in the fridge.

892
01:16:16,939 --> 01:16:18,566
I bought hamburger.

893
01:16:27,883 --> 01:16:29,441
Is the rice cooking?

894
01:16:29,618 --> 01:16:31,552
Yeah, it's almost done.

895
01:16:41,997 --> 01:16:44,989
Michiko came by my office
at lunch today.

896
01:16:47,302 --> 01:16:48,291
What for?

897
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:51,568
Your father wants
to marry her off.

898
01:16:52,975 --> 01:16:54,408
To whom?

899
01:16:54,576 --> 01:17:00,014
And how will he manage
when she's gone?

900
01:17:00,582 --> 01:17:02,573
She said the same thing.

901
01:17:02,751 --> 01:17:04,685
So she won't do it?

902
01:17:05,487 --> 01:17:09,321
I don't know, but he's been
bugging her for days.

903
01:17:09,491 --> 01:17:11,482
She's tired of it.

904
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:12,854
Who's the guy?

905
01:17:13,028 --> 01:17:17,931
Someone Mr. Kawai introduced.
Father met him and thinks he's fine.

906
01:17:18,333 --> 01:17:20,233
But Michiko doesn't like him?

907
01:17:20,402 --> 01:17:22,529
I couldn't tell,

908
01:17:22,704 --> 01:17:25,969
but she doesn't seem
opposed to getting married.

909
01:17:26,174 --> 01:17:27,835
So what's the problem?

910
01:17:28,410 --> 01:17:29,741
Good question.

911
01:17:29,911 --> 01:17:33,108
So why did she
come to see you?

912
01:17:33,281 --> 01:17:37,479
Well, I think I can
understand her feelings.

913
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:39,120
Is that right?

914
01:17:53,301 --> 01:17:54,268
Welcome.

915
01:17:54,436 --> 01:17:56,996
You're home early.

916
01:18:00,275 --> 01:18:03,438
Good evening, Father.
Please come in.

917
01:18:05,213 --> 01:18:07,943
- I brought some boiled beef.
- Thanks.

918
01:18:11,119 --> 01:18:12,643
Thank you very much.

919
01:18:13,255 --> 01:18:14,847
On your way home?

920
01:18:15,023 --> 01:18:19,426
Yes, but I'd like to speak to you.
Can you come out?

921
01:18:19,795 --> 01:18:21,922
I haven't eaten yet.

922
01:18:22,831 --> 01:18:24,822
Please stay for dinner.

923
01:18:26,034 --> 01:18:29,094
How about going out
for a bite?

924
01:18:29,571 --> 01:18:32,404
- If you insist.
- You're fine like that.

925
01:18:32,574 --> 01:18:33,563
All right.

926
01:18:42,617 --> 01:18:44,016
You know...

927
01:18:45,554 --> 01:18:47,522
I'm sure it's about Michiko.

928
01:18:51,293 --> 01:18:52,760
Let's go.

929
01:18:55,797 --> 01:18:57,958
I'll just borrow him
for a bit.

930
01:18:58,734 --> 01:19:00,725
Take care.

931
01:19:01,603 --> 01:19:03,537
See you soon.

932
01:19:31,533 --> 01:19:32,500
Excuse me.

933
01:19:39,374 --> 01:19:40,341
Thank you.

934
01:19:40,509 --> 01:19:42,170
All finished?

935
01:19:44,079 --> 01:19:45,740
Another, please.

936
01:20:13,475 --> 01:20:16,933
She looks like Mom?
I don't think so.

937
01:20:18,079 --> 01:20:22,345
Not if you look closely,
but there's a resemblance.

938
01:20:22,517 --> 01:20:24,075
Maybe.

939
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:27,381
So what about this prospect?

940
01:20:28,089 --> 01:20:30,751
He's the second son
of a good family.

941
01:20:30,926 --> 01:20:33,724
He looks healthy
and dependable.

942
01:20:34,296 --> 01:20:36,526
He's fine as far as
I'm concerned.

943
01:20:39,167 --> 01:20:42,398
But isn't Michiko
interested in someone else?

944
01:20:42,671 --> 01:20:44,263
You think so?

945
01:20:44,439 --> 01:20:47,033
- Yes.
- Me too.

946
01:20:47,342 --> 01:20:50,641
Kazu thinks she likes
a man named Miura.

947
01:20:50,812 --> 01:20:53,178
- Miura?
- From your company.

948
01:20:53,348 --> 01:20:55,612
- Him?
- What's he like?

949
01:20:55,784 --> 01:20:57,445
He's a nice guy.

950
01:20:57,619 --> 01:21:00,486
I'm all for him.
What does Michiko say?

951
01:21:01,556 --> 01:21:05,993
She was vague,
but I sense she likes him.

952
01:21:06,161 --> 01:21:07,560
Then it's simple.

953
01:21:07,729 --> 01:21:12,894
Why don't you hint at the idea
and see how he responds.

954
01:21:13,068 --> 01:21:17,505
Sure. He'll make her
a good husband.

955
01:21:17,806 --> 01:21:22,470
Probably best to let her
marry the man she likes.

956
01:21:24,579 --> 01:21:26,513
She'll be happier that way.

957
01:21:26,815 --> 01:21:30,046
That's right.
I'll talk to him right away.

958
01:21:30,218 --> 01:21:32,516
Please do.

959
01:21:39,728 --> 01:21:42,993
It's so quiet today.
Shall I play the song again?

960
01:21:43,164 --> 01:21:45,029
That's all right.

961
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:47,134
- What song?
- Oh, nothing.

962
01:21:55,277 --> 01:21:59,941
You know, you'll be lonely
when she's gone.

963
01:22:00,115 --> 01:22:02,640
But it's time for her
to get married.

964
01:22:39,387 --> 01:22:41,116
Sorry to keep you waiting.

965
01:22:44,526 --> 01:22:46,187
Did you call?

966
01:22:46,661 --> 01:22:49,721
- Two more of these.
- And another of these.

967
01:22:58,940 --> 01:23:00,407
More?

968
01:23:07,983 --> 01:23:10,042
You're a strong drinker.

969
01:23:10,585 --> 01:23:13,486
Not really.
Two big bottles is my limit.

970
01:23:17,359 --> 01:23:19,623
- Listen...
- What is it?

971
01:23:20,261 --> 01:23:23,162
- Have you considered marriage?
- Got a good prospect?

972
01:23:23,631 --> 01:23:27,032
I don't know how good,
but yes, I do.

973
01:23:27,435 --> 01:23:29,198
Really?

974
01:23:29,371 --> 01:23:31,896
I'm serious.

975
01:23:32,073 --> 01:23:33,870
So will you marry her?

976
01:23:36,111 --> 01:23:38,671
Well, there's a bit of a problem.

977
01:23:39,014 --> 01:23:43,212
What are you worried about?
What do you say?

978
01:23:45,620 --> 01:23:47,383
You're ready.

979
01:23:47,822 --> 01:23:49,619
I guess.

980
01:23:50,225 --> 01:23:52,819
The thing is,
I already have someone.

981
01:23:53,361 --> 01:23:54,385
You do?

982
01:23:54,829 --> 01:23:57,491
We're not married yet,
but we're together.

983
01:23:59,167 --> 01:24:00,725
Really?

984
01:24:01,102 --> 01:24:03,297
- You know her.
- Who is it?

985
01:24:03,471 --> 01:24:06,304
- Miyoko Inoue.
- Oh, her.

986
01:24:06,508 --> 01:24:09,170
You don't approve?

987
01:24:09,411 --> 01:24:11,572
No, she's very nice.

988
01:24:11,746 --> 01:24:16,012
Don't tell anyone yet.
We haven't said anything.

989
01:24:17,385 --> 01:24:18,818
I won't.

990
01:24:18,987 --> 01:24:20,249
We're engaged.

991
01:24:23,525 --> 01:24:24,787
Since when?

992
01:24:25,126 --> 01:24:28,254
Since the company outing
last summer.

993
01:24:28,496 --> 01:24:30,726
That long?

994
01:24:30,899 --> 01:24:33,333
But I haven't
touched her yet.

995
01:24:33,501 --> 01:24:34,729
Liar!

996
01:24:34,903 --> 01:24:37,133
Well, we have held hands.

997
01:24:41,009 --> 01:24:42,943
Who did you have in mind?

998
01:24:43,344 --> 01:24:44,811
Forget it.

999
01:24:45,513 --> 01:24:48,277
Tell me.
I told you mine.

1000
01:24:50,418 --> 01:24:51,908
Who is it?

1001
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:55,287
My sister.

1002
01:24:55,623 --> 01:24:57,488
Michiko?

1003
01:24:59,327 --> 01:25:01,295
Does she know about this?

1004
01:25:01,529 --> 01:25:02,996
Yes.

1005
01:25:03,531 --> 01:25:04,896
Anyway...

1006
01:25:05,867 --> 01:25:08,233
I wish I'd known sooner.

1007
01:25:08,403 --> 01:25:10,530
I even asked you once.

1008
01:25:10,705 --> 01:25:13,765
You said she wasn't ready
to marry yet.

1009
01:25:14,142 --> 01:25:17,236
Really? I said that?

1010
01:25:18,113 --> 01:25:20,411
You sure did.

1011
01:25:21,149 --> 01:25:25,210
Michiko said as much too,
so I gave up.

1012
01:25:28,723 --> 01:25:30,691
How about another bottle?

1013
01:25:34,963 --> 01:25:38,364
Is that right?
I guess it was my fault then.

1014
01:25:39,067 --> 01:25:43,265
What a shame!
You should have mentioned it sooner.

1015
01:25:43,571 --> 01:25:45,732
Some things
just don't work out.

1016
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:47,905
Yeah, I guess not.

1017
01:25:51,312 --> 01:25:54,304
- Shall we order more?
- Sure.

1018
01:25:58,686 --> 01:26:00,278
It's really good.

1019
01:26:22,277 --> 01:26:24,404
It's my fault.

1020
01:26:24,579 --> 01:26:27,309
I should have thought
about it sooner.

1021
01:26:28,883 --> 01:26:31,647
We have to tell her
what happened.

1022
01:26:32,854 --> 01:26:34,788
I'm afraid you're right.

1023
01:26:36,024 --> 01:26:38,652
Would you talk to her?

1024
01:26:38,826 --> 01:26:39,986
Me?

1025
01:26:41,229 --> 01:26:46,030
Her heart's set on him.
I asked her this morning.

1026
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:49,728
I think maybe
you should tell her.

1027
01:26:50,738 --> 01:26:52,865
Anyway, I feel bad for her.

1028
01:26:53,141 --> 01:26:54,665
Me too.

1029
01:26:55,076 --> 01:26:57,067
What can I tell her?

1030
01:27:05,253 --> 01:27:08,017
How about some tea?
Koichi?

1031
01:27:08,189 --> 01:27:10,180
That's all right.

1032
01:27:12,193 --> 01:27:14,286
- Michiko.
- Yes?

1033
01:27:14,462 --> 01:27:16,157
Come here a minute.

1034
01:27:20,101 --> 01:27:21,591
Sit down.

1035
01:27:24,072 --> 01:27:25,039
What is it?

1036
01:27:25,573 --> 01:27:29,009
I didn't mean to interfere,

1037
01:27:29,177 --> 01:27:33,910
but I had Koichi ask Mr. Miura
how he felt about you.

1038
01:27:36,384 --> 01:27:38,409
The thing is...

1039
01:27:38,586 --> 01:27:42,488
Miura liked you, all right,
but he's already engaged.

1040
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:49,826
I should've looked
into it sooner.

1041
01:27:50,565 --> 01:27:51,964
I'm sorry.

1042
01:28:00,875 --> 01:28:05,744
Even I never suspected
how you felt about Miura.

1043
01:28:05,913 --> 01:28:11,681
It was my fault for not
inquiring sooner. I'm sorry.

1044
01:28:13,121 --> 01:28:15,749
It's all right, Father.

1045
01:28:16,024 --> 01:28:18,720
I just wanted
to know my options.

1046
01:28:19,594 --> 01:28:21,824
I'm glad you asked him.

1047
01:28:22,530 --> 01:28:23,497
Really?

1048
01:28:24,132 --> 01:28:29,126
Then why don't you meet
the man Dad's been suggesting?

1049
01:28:31,539 --> 01:28:32,972
Will you?

1050
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:34,108
Yes.

1051
01:28:34,275 --> 01:28:35,867
So it's all right?

1052
01:28:36,244 --> 01:28:39,941
Yes. I'll leave it to you.

1053
01:28:44,652 --> 01:28:46,279
I'm glad she took it well.

1054
01:28:46,454 --> 01:28:48,945
Yes, indeed.

1055
01:28:49,123 --> 01:28:51,182
I was afraid she'd cry.

1056
01:28:51,359 --> 01:28:54,954
Yes, I thought she'd be
more disappointed.

1057
01:28:55,129 --> 01:28:57,063
She looked so calm.

1058
01:28:57,265 --> 01:28:59,233
Yes, thank goodness.

1059
01:29:04,872 --> 01:29:06,897
- What's with Sis?
- What do you mean?

1060
01:29:07,075 --> 01:29:09,339
Looks like she's been crying.

1061
01:29:35,169 --> 01:29:37,501
Hey, what's wrong?

1062
01:29:39,874 --> 01:29:41,466
What is it?

1063
01:29:46,814 --> 01:29:50,750
Look, I'm not insisting
on this other man.

1064
01:29:51,686 --> 01:29:54,120
If you don't like him,
you can say so.

1065
01:29:59,293 --> 01:30:03,559
But at least meet him once,
all right?

1066
01:30:04,932 --> 01:30:06,627
All right.

1067
01:30:07,301 --> 01:30:08,791
Good.

1068
01:30:14,942 --> 01:30:19,003
Want to come down for tea?
Come and join us.

1069
01:31:19,974 --> 01:31:21,441
Excuse me.

1070
01:31:28,249 --> 01:31:32,151
Welcome.
Please come in.

1071
01:31:32,820 --> 01:31:35,414
Professor Horie is already here.
- Really?

1072
01:31:35,590 --> 01:31:37,785
Come in, please.

1073
01:31:40,194 --> 01:31:42,822
- Is he here?
- Yes.

1074
01:31:44,298 --> 01:31:46,766
- Please sit down.
- Thank you.

1075
01:31:48,503 --> 01:31:50,733
- Hi.
- You're late.

1076
01:31:56,644 --> 01:31:58,544
Horie, when did you get here?

1077
01:31:59,847 --> 01:32:01,872
I heard you'd be coming.

1078
01:32:04,185 --> 01:32:06,210
So that's it, eh?

1079
01:32:07,421 --> 01:32:09,685
If you do that...

1080
01:32:10,925 --> 01:32:12,552
Close game.

1081
01:32:12,727 --> 01:32:14,991
This is my game.

1082
01:32:16,731 --> 01:32:18,722
Help yourself.

1083
01:32:29,210 --> 01:32:34,876
As I mentioned on the phone,
about that marriage proposal...

1084
01:32:37,218 --> 01:32:39,652
can we arrange a meeting?

1085
01:32:39,820 --> 01:32:42,254
Sure.

1086
01:32:42,423 --> 01:32:45,051
Would you find out
when is good for him?

1087
01:32:45,226 --> 01:32:47,456
What's all this about?

1088
01:32:49,397 --> 01:32:51,228
Michiko.

1089
01:32:51,799 --> 01:32:55,496
Now wait a minute!
You can't play both ends.

1090
01:32:56,370 --> 01:32:59,203
Wait till my party replies.

1091
01:33:00,007 --> 01:33:00,974
What's this?

1092
01:33:01,976 --> 01:33:06,970
You dragged your feet,
so Kawai approached me.

1093
01:33:07,148 --> 01:33:08,979
Since it was Saturday,

1094
01:33:09,450 --> 01:33:11,782
we held a go-between
meeting yesterday.

1095
01:33:11,953 --> 01:33:14,820
I have a nice girl lined up.
Right?

1096
01:33:16,891 --> 01:33:18,552
Isn't she nice?

1097
01:33:18,726 --> 01:33:20,626
Very nice.

1098
01:33:21,829 --> 01:33:24,161
My assistant's sister.

1099
01:33:24,332 --> 01:33:28,291
A little shorter than Michiko,
but very attractive.

1100
01:33:28,469 --> 01:33:30,960
- I see.
- She's 24.

1101
01:33:31,138 --> 01:33:33,868
They were in quite a rush.

1102
01:33:34,041 --> 01:33:37,408
Really?
So it's decided?

1103
01:33:37,578 --> 01:33:41,639
Yes, it seems that way.

1104
01:33:42,783 --> 01:33:46,913
They seemed crazy about each other.
- Is that right?

1105
01:33:47,355 --> 01:33:48,754
Right?

1106
01:33:56,664 --> 01:33:59,792
You were too slow.
I'm sorry.

1107
01:34:00,167 --> 01:34:01,464
I see.

1108
01:34:03,838 --> 01:34:05,806
Don't be so cruel.

1109
01:34:11,879 --> 01:34:13,870
What's so funny?

1110
01:34:15,349 --> 01:34:17,943
Lies, all of it.

1111
01:34:18,119 --> 01:34:21,350
They planned it
before you came.

1112
01:34:21,522 --> 01:34:24,958
Really?
The rascals!

1113
01:34:27,595 --> 01:34:33,795
What about your planning my wake?
Now we're even.

1114
01:34:33,968 --> 01:34:37,096
I guess so.
But you did give me a scare.

1115
01:34:37,438 --> 01:34:39,463
What a relief!

1116
01:34:41,542 --> 01:34:45,308
Mr. Hirayama, won't you
be lonely without Michiko?

1117
01:34:45,479 --> 01:34:47,174
Well...

1118
01:34:49,417 --> 01:34:52,853
But he can't hold on
to her forever.

1119
01:34:56,490 --> 01:34:59,152
I hope she likes him.

1120
01:34:59,326 --> 01:35:01,157
She will.

1121
01:35:01,962 --> 01:35:04,863
I think so too.

1122
01:35:05,032 --> 01:35:08,160
When things are right,
it's mutual.

1123
01:35:08,335 --> 01:35:10,360
Like in my case.

1124
01:35:13,407 --> 01:35:15,967
Hey, it's your turn.

1125
01:35:16,143 --> 01:35:18,111
Really?

1126
01:35:19,346 --> 01:35:21,075
My turn, is it?

1127
01:35:29,023 --> 01:35:33,289
The setting sun in autumn

1128
01:35:33,661 --> 01:35:38,860
The mountain glows
with changing colors

1129
01:35:39,033 --> 01:35:43,026
Some of them are deep

1130
01:35:43,437 --> 01:35:47,897
Some of them are light

1131
01:35:48,309 --> 01:35:51,676
The green hue of the pines...

1132
01:35:51,979 --> 01:35:53,469
Hello?

1133
01:35:53,914 --> 01:35:55,779
Yes, that's right.

1134
01:35:55,950 --> 01:35:57,645
What?

1135
01:36:00,321 --> 01:36:04,121
Y es, we already have two cars.
We need one more.

1136
01:36:04,358 --> 01:36:07,384
A small one's okay.

1137
01:36:07,561 --> 01:36:11,258
That's right.
And please hurry.

1138
01:36:15,336 --> 01:36:17,099
It'll be here soon.

1139
01:36:17,271 --> 01:36:18,761
Good.

1140
01:36:18,939 --> 01:36:22,602
The car's taken care of.
Go lock the back doors.

1141
01:36:22,777 --> 01:36:24,870
Things are so hectic.

1142
01:36:33,988 --> 01:36:37,389
I'll send Akiko over
until you can hire some help.

1143
01:36:37,558 --> 01:36:41,050
That's all right.
She has her own work.

1144
01:36:43,531 --> 01:36:45,829
Is she expecting yet?

1145
01:36:46,500 --> 01:36:47,432
What do you mean?

1146
01:36:47,601 --> 01:36:48,932
A baby.

1147
01:36:49,770 --> 01:36:51,897
No, not yet.

1148
01:36:52,072 --> 01:36:54,597
We couldn't afford one
now anyway.

1149
01:36:56,243 --> 01:36:58,768
- Are you taking precautions?
- Yes.

1150
01:37:01,715 --> 01:37:02,682
Sort of.

1151
01:37:02,850 --> 01:37:05,045
Have kids already.

1152
01:37:05,219 --> 01:37:09,155
You don't want them finishing
middle school when you're 50.

1153
01:37:09,323 --> 01:37:10,790
You're right.

1154
01:37:11,892 --> 01:37:14,793
How old were you
when I was born?

1155
01:37:15,596 --> 01:37:16,995
I was 26.

1156
01:37:17,164 --> 01:37:19,064
Twenty-six?

1157
01:37:23,003 --> 01:37:25,198
Sir, the bride is ready.

1158
01:37:25,372 --> 01:37:26,930
Is she?

1159
01:37:27,541 --> 01:37:29,008
Thank you.

1160
01:37:46,493 --> 01:37:48,120
Thank you.

1161
01:37:49,230 --> 01:37:52,028
- We'll go on ahead.
- Thanks.

1162
01:37:54,702 --> 01:37:56,602
Please come in.

1163
01:38:02,910 --> 01:38:05,242
All set to go?

1164
01:38:14,755 --> 01:38:17,690
- You look beautiful.
- Lovely.

1165
01:38:20,094 --> 01:38:21,857
Shall we go?

1166
01:38:51,525 --> 01:38:53,322
Father.

1167
01:38:54,495 --> 01:38:56,861
I know, I know.

1168
01:38:57,364 --> 01:38:59,662
Be a good wife.

1169
01:39:01,502 --> 01:39:03,333
And be happy.

1170
01:39:08,409 --> 01:39:10,434
Now let's go.

1171
01:40:13,674 --> 01:40:15,733
- Really?
- Absolutely!

1172
01:40:17,778 --> 01:40:20,645
- Now it's your turn.
- Meaning?

1173
01:40:20,814 --> 01:40:23,214
How about a young wife?

1174
01:40:23,384 --> 01:40:26,319
- With the help of those pills?
- That's right.

1175
01:40:26,887 --> 01:40:29,219
Come on now.

1176
01:40:30,290 --> 01:40:35,159
Horie, you're starting
to seem sort of unclean to me.

1177
01:40:35,329 --> 01:40:37,889
Unclean? How so?

1178
01:40:38,065 --> 01:40:39,396
You know...

1179
01:40:39,566 --> 01:40:42,330
Nonsense!
I'm very neat and clean.

1180
01:40:42,503 --> 01:40:46,030
Clean by day,
filthy by night?

1181
01:40:47,007 --> 01:40:48,804
Oh, I get it.

1182
01:40:51,445 --> 01:40:52,878
Indeed!

1183
01:40:53,047 --> 01:40:54,674
What's that mean?

1184
01:40:57,851 --> 01:41:01,844
Mr. Hirayama, will Koichi
and his wife move in with you?

1185
01:41:02,022 --> 01:41:06,584
No, I still have Kazu.
We'll get by.

1186
01:41:07,327 --> 01:41:10,490
Young couples
should have their own lives.

1187
01:41:10,664 --> 01:41:14,122
Yes, old-timers
should stay out of their way.

1188
01:41:16,503 --> 01:41:19,472
You're such a good father.

1189
01:41:26,413 --> 01:41:27,744
Thank you.

1190
01:41:27,915 --> 01:41:29,576
Not at all.

1191
01:41:36,623 --> 01:41:41,185
You know,
sons are actually best.

1192
01:41:41,361 --> 01:41:42,794
It's true.

1193
01:41:42,963 --> 01:41:45,898
There's no point
having a daughter.

1194
01:41:47,134 --> 01:41:52,436
Boy or girl, it's all the same.
They all go sooner or later.

1195
01:41:52,606 --> 01:41:55,973
And leave the aged behind.

1196
01:41:56,143 --> 01:41:58,077
Who are you to complain?

1197
01:41:58,612 --> 01:42:02,514
Well, I married off
my daughter too.

1198
01:42:03,150 --> 01:42:04,617
Well...

1199
01:42:05,619 --> 01:42:08,087
it's hardly worth
bringing them up.

1200
01:42:08,956 --> 01:42:10,685
It's true.

1201
01:42:11,758 --> 01:42:14,124
As the Gourd said,

1202
01:42:14,294 --> 01:42:17,559
""ln the end,
we spend our lives alone."

1203
01:42:17,731 --> 01:42:20,291
Be glad you're not like him.

1204
01:42:22,769 --> 01:42:24,794
The Gourd, huh?

1205
01:42:25,172 --> 01:42:26,799
Well, I'll be going.

1206
01:42:27,274 --> 01:42:28,434
You're leaving?

1207
01:42:28,609 --> 01:42:30,543
Yes, excuse me.

1208
01:42:32,446 --> 01:42:35,779
Are you all right?
Shall I call a cab?

1209
01:42:36,483 --> 01:42:40,544
Thank you for all
you've done today.

1210
01:42:41,088 --> 01:42:43,113
And thanks to you two.

1211
01:42:43,290 --> 01:42:45,258
Sure you're all right?

1212
01:42:47,528 --> 01:42:50,964
I'm fine.
I'll stroll down to the station.

1213
01:42:51,131 --> 01:42:52,792
Shall I go with you?

1214
01:42:52,966 --> 01:42:55,730
Don't bother. Stay here.

1215
01:42:57,938 --> 01:42:59,599
Is this yours?

1216
01:42:59,773 --> 01:43:01,468
No, that's mine.

1217
01:43:01,808 --> 01:43:05,141
See you.

1218
01:43:07,814 --> 01:43:09,304
More?

1219
01:43:18,292 --> 01:43:20,226
What's wrong with him?

1220
01:43:22,129 --> 01:43:25,929
He wants to be alone.
He misses her.

1221
01:43:26,567 --> 01:43:31,231
The first night after losing
a daughter is tough.

1222
01:43:31,405 --> 01:43:33,100
It's true.

1223
01:43:38,345 --> 01:43:41,781
After all the work
of raising them.

1224
01:43:46,753 --> 01:43:48,721
They leave so soon.

1225
01:44:18,986 --> 01:44:20,510
Welcome.

1226
01:44:28,695 --> 01:44:30,219
Welcome back.

1227
01:44:33,467 --> 01:44:36,061
Mr. Sakamoto just left.

1228
01:44:36,236 --> 01:44:38,796
Really?
Can I get a drink?

1229
01:44:38,972 --> 01:44:40,200
With water?

1230
01:44:40,374 --> 01:44:41,966
No, straight up.

1231
01:44:45,912 --> 01:44:47,880
Where have you come from?

1232
01:44:49,283 --> 01:44:50,716
A funeral?

1233
01:44:50,884 --> 01:44:53,580
Something like that.

1234
01:45:00,694 --> 01:45:02,491
Shall I play that song?

1235
01:45:04,765 --> 01:45:07,928
Kayo, put on the march.

1236
01:45:38,198 --> 01:45:40,462
""Report from
imperial headquarters:

1237
01:45:40,634 --> 01:45:46,038
At 05:30 hrs., Imperial Navy units
engaged the enemy..."

1238
01:45:46,206 --> 01:45:48,174
- And lost!
- That's right.

1239
01:45:48,342 --> 01:45:50,139
They lost the battle.

1240
01:47:03,016 --> 01:47:05,814
Dad's late.
I wonder where he went.

1241
01:47:05,986 --> 01:47:08,716
Yeah, he is late.

1242
01:47:09,756 --> 01:47:11,656
Probably at Mr. Kawai's.

1243
01:47:13,093 --> 01:47:14,685
He's still late.

1244
01:47:14,861 --> 01:47:16,453
I guess so.

1245
01:47:18,999 --> 01:47:20,990
Here he is now.

1246
01:47:25,672 --> 01:47:27,663
Welcome home.

1247
01:47:27,941 --> 01:47:29,909
Did you have a lot to drink?

1248
01:47:38,051 --> 01:47:39,916
Father, where were you?

1249
01:47:40,086 --> 01:47:42,213
- Welcome back.
- Ah, you're here?

1250
01:47:42,389 --> 01:47:44,380
You're quite late.

1251
01:47:44,658 --> 01:47:46,455
You must be tired.

1252
01:47:49,095 --> 01:47:51,188
But it was nice, wasn't it?

1253
01:47:51,765 --> 01:47:54,757
Yes, it was.

1254
01:47:55,602 --> 01:47:58,935
I hope everything
works out for her.

1255
01:47:59,105 --> 01:48:01,596
Don't worry. It will.

1256
01:48:01,975 --> 01:48:04,637
Michiko's a smart girl.
She'll be fine.

1257
01:48:09,049 --> 01:48:10,846
I hope so.

1258
01:48:11,084 --> 01:48:14,212
Don't worry.
She'll be just fine.

1259
01:48:16,122 --> 01:48:17,555
We should go.

1260
01:48:18,692 --> 01:48:20,182
Yes.

1261
01:48:20,360 --> 01:48:23,124
I'll stop by now and then.
Call if you need me.

1262
01:48:26,166 --> 01:48:28,157
Father, we'll be going.

1263
01:48:29,669 --> 01:48:31,466
You're leaving?

1264
01:48:32,072 --> 01:48:34,438
I'll drop in now and then.

1265
01:48:40,313 --> 01:48:41,678
See you later.

1266
01:49:02,469 --> 01:49:04,699
- Take care.
- Good night.

1267
01:49:04,871 --> 01:49:06,361
Good night.

1268
01:49:23,089 --> 01:49:25,751
Father, I'm going to bed.

1269
01:49:26,026 --> 01:49:27,721
Go ahead.

1270
01:49:39,673 --> 01:49:41,698
Father...

1271
01:49:46,012 --> 01:49:48,173
don't drink too much.

1272
01:49:49,783 --> 01:49:53,344
Take care of yourself.
Don't go dying on me.

1273
01:49:53,520 --> 01:49:55,681
I'm all right.

1274
01:49:58,425 --> 01:50:05,354
Defending or attacking,
our iron ships...

1275
01:50:05,532 --> 01:50:08,092
Go to sleep already!

1276
01:50:11,471 --> 01:50:18,400
Are trusty floating castles

1277
01:50:18,578 --> 01:50:23,481
What are you going on about?
Come on, go to bed.

1278
01:50:25,285 --> 01:50:27,913
It's not my fault
if you catch cold.

1279
01:50:30,790 --> 01:50:32,758
I'm asleep already.

1280
01:50:34,427 --> 01:50:36,759
We have
an early day tomorrow.

1281
01:50:39,132 --> 01:50:41,225
I'll make you breakfast.

1282
01:50:50,710 --> 01:50:53,201
I'm all alone...

1283
01:50:55,315 --> 01:51:01,686
Floating castles guard
the Land of the Rising Sun...

1284
01:52:38,284 --> 01:52:45,315
THE END
