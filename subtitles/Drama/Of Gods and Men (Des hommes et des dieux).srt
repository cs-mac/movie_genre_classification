1
00:00:39,887 --> 00:00:43,414
I said, "You are gods,
sons of the Most High.

2
00:00:43,527 --> 00:00:47,054
But you shall die like men
and fall like princes."

3
00:02:29,487 --> 00:02:34,698
OF GODS AND MEN

4
00:02:41,367 --> 00:02:45,452
Lord, open my lips

5
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:51,338
And my mouth will proclaim your praise

6
00:04:12,087 --> 00:04:13,577
Aspirin...

7
00:04:16,207 --> 00:04:19,211
And cough syrup.

8
00:05:26,847 --> 00:05:28,576
There's hot tea.

9
00:05:30,447 --> 00:05:31,528
Help me, Papa.

10
00:05:51,807 --> 00:05:54,048
- Brother Luc.
- Nouredine, labesse??

11
00:05:54,167 --> 00:05:56,249
And you?

12
00:05:56,367 --> 00:05:57,812
Saturday is Jamel's "khtana" (circumcision).

13
00:05:57,927 --> 00:06:00,009
Will there be a party?

14
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:01,936
You're all invited.

15
00:06:02,647 --> 00:06:04,456
- Will you come?
- I'd love to.

16
00:06:04,567 --> 00:06:06,217
See you later. Take care.

17
00:06:06,327 --> 00:06:07,817
Yes, you too.

18
00:06:14,367 --> 00:06:16,608
Little brat! You're here?

19
00:06:16,727 --> 00:06:18,377
Not at school today?

20
00:06:38,047 --> 00:06:39,458
Good.

21
00:06:39,567 --> 00:06:41,057
It's almost dry.

22
00:06:41,767 --> 00:06:44,737
Stop with the bandages.

23
00:06:44,847 --> 00:06:47,327
Be sure to keep her out of the sun.

24
00:06:47,447 --> 00:06:50,337
That would be dangerous. Forbidden.

25
00:06:50,447 --> 00:06:53,257
Otherwise, all's well.

26
00:06:54,927 --> 00:06:56,417
Little kiss.

27
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:01,773
What else?

28
00:07:06,207 --> 00:07:07,618
I see.

29
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:10,128
It's serious.

30
00:07:10,967 --> 00:07:12,776
Be right back.

31
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:00,177
Asleep, brother?

32
00:08:06,767 --> 00:08:08,257
Here.

33
00:11:24,687 --> 00:11:28,817
Guide us in the straight path,

34
00:11:28,927 --> 00:11:32,409
the path of those
whom Thou hast blessed,

35
00:11:32,527 --> 00:11:35,610
not those against
whom Thou art wrathful,

36
00:11:35,727 --> 00:11:39,777
nor those who are astray.

37
00:11:40,807 --> 00:11:43,856
Amen.

38
00:11:43,967 --> 00:11:48,131
The Messenger believes
in what was sent down to him

39
00:11:48,247 --> 00:11:51,888
from his Lord, and the believers:

40
00:11:52,007 --> 00:11:56,331
each one believes in God,

41
00:11:56,447 --> 00:12:00,168
His angels, His Books
and His Messengers.

42
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:04,087
We make no division
between any one of His Messengers.

43
00:12:04,207 --> 00:12:08,132
They say, "We hear and obey."

44
00:12:08,247 --> 00:12:10,898
"Lord, grant us Thy forgiveness."

45
00:12:11,007 --> 00:12:13,897
"Unto Thee is the homecoming."

46
00:12:14,007 --> 00:12:18,490
God charges
no soul save to its capacity.

47
00:12:18,607 --> 00:12:21,008
It will be rewarded for good it has done

48
00:12:21,127 --> 00:12:23,653
and punished for evil it has done.

49
00:12:23,767 --> 00:12:31,413
Lord, take us not to task
if we forget or make mistake.

50
00:12:31,527 --> 00:12:35,248
Lord, charge us not with a load

51
00:12:35,367 --> 00:12:39,656
such as Thou didst lay
upon those before us.

52
00:12:39,767 --> 00:12:45,456
Lord, do not burden us beyond
what we have the strength to bear.

53
00:12:45,567 --> 00:12:50,175
And pardon us, and forgive us

54
00:12:50,287 --> 00:12:52,130
and have mercy on us.

55
00:12:52,247 --> 00:12:53,772
Thou art our Protector.

56
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:59,132
And help us against the people
of the unbelievers.

57
00:15:20,647 --> 00:15:22,968
How do you know
when you're in love?

58
00:15:24,687 --> 00:15:26,177
There's...

59
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:29,811
...something inside you
that comes alive.

60
00:15:29,927 --> 00:15:31,929
The presence of someone.

61
00:15:32,847 --> 00:15:37,250
It's irrepressible and makes your heart
beat faster, usually.

62
00:15:40,047 --> 00:15:43,733
It's an attraction, a desire...

63
00:15:43,847 --> 00:15:45,576
It's very beautiful.

64
00:15:45,687 --> 00:15:49,328
No use asking too many questions.

65
00:15:49,447 --> 00:15:51,051
It just happens.

66
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:53,568
Things are as usual, then suddenly...

67
00:15:54,647 --> 00:15:58,891
...happiness arrives, or the hope of it.
it's lots of things.

68
00:15:59,007 --> 00:16:01,294
But you're in turmoil.

69
00:16:01,407 --> 00:16:02,852
Great turmoil.

70
00:16:02,967 --> 00:16:05,208
Especially the first time.

71
00:16:08,127 --> 00:16:11,449
Your father spoke to me about Khaled.

72
00:16:11,567 --> 00:16:13,376
My father speaks too much.

73
00:16:13,487 --> 00:16:14,727
I don't want that.

74
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:18,568
I feel none of the things you mentioned
when I see Khaled.

75
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:21,167
That means it's not very serious.

76
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:24,249
My father wants it, not me.

77
00:16:25,447 --> 00:16:27,609
That's another problem.

78
00:16:38,727 --> 00:16:40,217
Ever been in love?

79
00:16:41,207 --> 00:16:42,936
Several times, yes.

80
00:16:43,647 --> 00:16:47,891
And then I encountered another love,
even greater.

81
00:16:49,287 --> 00:16:52,177
And I answered that love.

82
00:16:53,327 --> 00:16:55,056
It's been a while now.

83
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:57,456
Over 60 years.

84
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:58,810
Here,
you have to put your son's address.

85
00:18:59,487 --> 00:19:00,818
He's no longer at home?

86
00:19:00,927 --> 00:19:03,578
He lives far away now.

87
00:19:15,407 --> 00:19:16,897
Abdallah...

88
00:19:17,647 --> 00:19:19,137
Taroudi.

89
00:19:20,687 --> 00:19:23,497
13 Rue d'Etretat.

90
00:19:25,487 --> 00:19:26,977
Le Havre.

91
00:19:33,407 --> 00:19:36,411
And here they ask for two photos.

92
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,537
Do you have photos?

93
00:19:41,327 --> 00:19:44,570
Listen, Tuesday
we're going to the market.

94
00:19:45,447 --> 00:19:47,256
We can take you along.

95
00:19:48,127 --> 00:19:49,936
And have photos taken.

96
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:51,608
Okay?

97
00:20:10,487 --> 00:20:12,649
My cousin from Mostaganem...

98
00:20:13,607 --> 00:20:15,928
They killed her granddaughter.

99
00:20:16,647 --> 00:20:18,092
This afternoon.

100
00:20:18,207 --> 00:20:20,653
She's 18. Samira.

101
00:20:20,767 --> 00:20:22,895
They stabbed her on the bus.

102
00:20:23,007 --> 00:20:25,169
Right in the heart.

103
00:20:26,847 --> 00:20:28,178
Those dogs.

104
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:30,415
They threw her out like a dog.

105
00:20:30,527 --> 00:20:32,529
And for a veil!

106
00:20:32,647 --> 00:20:34,809
She didn't wear the hijab.

107
00:20:34,927 --> 00:20:38,454
What's the problem with these people?
it's beyond me.

108
00:20:38,567 --> 00:20:40,410
Is that normal?

109
00:20:40,527 --> 00:20:43,292
God says in the Koran,

110
00:20:43,407 --> 00:20:46,092
"You kill your brother, you go to hell."

111
00:20:46,687 --> 00:20:50,533
They say they're religious.
They've never read the Koran.

112
00:20:50,647 --> 00:20:53,127
In the Koran, it's written down.

113
00:20:53,247 --> 00:20:55,056
Does it make sense to you?

114
00:20:55,767 --> 00:20:57,690
Look at France.

115
00:20:57,807 --> 00:20:59,650
Schoolgirls make an uproar

116
00:20:59,767 --> 00:21:01,576
about wearing a veil.

117
00:21:02,727 --> 00:21:04,889
The world's gone mad, Christian.

118
00:21:05,007 --> 00:21:06,497
True.

119
00:21:07,727 --> 00:21:09,968
They're killing imams too.

120
00:21:10,087 --> 00:21:12,613
Yesterday they killed an imam
in the street.

121
00:21:12,727 --> 00:21:14,217
Where are we going?

122
00:21:14,327 --> 00:21:17,774
I don't know who these people are.
Only God knows.

123
00:21:17,887 --> 00:21:20,538
This is new. No one understands.

124
00:21:20,647 --> 00:21:22,376
Who's killing who?

125
00:21:24,327 --> 00:21:27,217
We'll pray for Samira and her family.

126
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:28,817
May she go to Heaven.

127
00:22:06,487 --> 00:22:07,488
It's not mine.

128
00:22:07,607 --> 00:22:10,178
- Whose then?
- The haji's.

129
00:22:33,407 --> 00:22:34,454
Get lost!

130
00:22:41,127 --> 00:22:42,333
Kill him!

131
00:22:46,207 --> 00:22:47,413
Beat it!

132
00:23:03,087 --> 00:23:04,896
Are you stupid?

133
00:23:32,487 --> 00:23:33,977
Christian!

134
00:23:36,927 --> 00:23:38,417
They killed the Croatians!

135
00:23:39,487 --> 00:23:40,852
Our friends, the workers.

136
00:23:41,527 --> 00:23:44,178
Throats slashed, all of them.

137
00:24:08,767 --> 00:24:10,769
You need military protection.

138
00:24:10,887 --> 00:24:13,174
That is not an option.

139
00:24:13,287 --> 00:24:16,575
How can you say that?
Those men were killed nearby!

140
00:24:16,687 --> 00:24:18,496
The atrocities will continue.

141
00:24:19,807 --> 00:24:22,413
The Walt's offer deserves
to be discussed.

142
00:24:23,167 --> 00:24:25,534
There are families here.
Think of them.

143
00:24:25,647 --> 00:24:27,570
I made my decision. I refuse.

144
00:24:31,327 --> 00:24:33,329
Let's speak inside.

145
00:24:40,087 --> 00:24:43,773
We'll lock the gate at 7:30
and take no night calls.

146
00:24:43,887 --> 00:24:45,935
Do you think that's enough?

147
00:24:46,807 --> 00:24:48,332
You don't know them.

148
00:25:01,687 --> 00:25:03,689
Try to make him see reason.

149
00:25:03,807 --> 00:25:05,377
Is your phone working?

150
00:25:05,487 --> 00:25:07,455
We can't complain.

151
00:25:07,567 --> 00:25:09,888
Call us before it's too late.

152
00:25:34,527 --> 00:25:40,057
Because he is with us
in this time of violence

153
00:25:40,407 --> 00:25:44,298
Let us not dream
that he is everywhere

154
00:25:44,407 --> 00:25:46,728
Other than where we die

155
00:25:46,847 --> 00:25:48,815
Let us make haste

156
00:25:48,927 --> 00:25:54,093
Let us draw patience from him

157
00:25:54,207 --> 00:25:58,371
Let us turn to the Man of Sorrows

158
00:25:58,487 --> 00:26:03,698
Who beckons us from the cross

159
00:26:05,407 --> 00:26:11,255
Because he is with us
as on Easter morn

160
00:26:11,367 --> 00:26:15,452
Let us not forget

161
00:26:15,567 --> 00:26:17,695
The blood he shed

162
00:26:17,807 --> 00:26:19,775
Let us break the bread

163
00:26:19,887 --> 00:26:25,257
Let as drink
from the chalice of passage

164
00:26:25,367 --> 00:26:29,691
Let us greet the one
who sacrificed himself

165
00:26:29,807 --> 00:26:35,337
By loving us until the end

166
00:27:09,007 --> 00:27:12,568
Through Him, with Him and in Him,

167
00:27:12,687 --> 00:27:15,372
You shall receive, Almighty Father,

168
00:27:15,487 --> 00:27:17,774
in the unity of the Holy Spirit,

169
00:27:17,887 --> 00:27:21,369
all glory and honor,
forever and ever.

170
00:27:23,167 --> 00:27:26,614
How could you decide this
without consulting us?

171
00:27:26,727 --> 00:27:28,729
All our lives are at stake.

172
00:27:29,687 --> 00:27:31,098
What would you have done?

173
00:27:31,207 --> 00:27:35,371
I'd have let everyone speak
and listened to each position.

174
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,694
To answer what, in the end?

175
00:27:37,807 --> 00:27:39,650
The answer doesn't matter.

176
00:27:39,767 --> 00:27:44,648
The very principle of community
is compromised by your attitude.

177
00:27:46,847 --> 00:27:50,533
Who wants the army
present in the monastery?

178
00:27:52,807 --> 00:27:55,572
You refuse to understand
what we're saying.

179
00:27:55,687 --> 00:27:56,688
I do understand!

180
00:27:56,807 --> 00:27:59,697
None of us chose to live here,

181
00:27:59,807 --> 00:28:02,538
to be protected
by a corrupt government.

182
00:28:10,007 --> 00:28:11,338
Christian,

183
00:28:11,447 --> 00:28:14,496
we didn't elect you
to decide on your own.

184
00:28:21,247 --> 00:28:22,931
And if they come here?

185
00:28:24,047 --> 00:28:25,333
We lie down and die?

186
00:28:28,287 --> 00:28:29,527
It's a risk.

187
00:28:32,167 --> 00:28:34,488
We were called to live here.

188
00:28:34,607 --> 00:28:36,974
In this country, with these people,

189
00:28:37,087 --> 00:28:38,816
who are also afraid.

190
00:28:40,487 --> 00:28:44,048
We'll live with this unknown, yes.

191
00:28:45,247 --> 00:28:48,933
I didn't come here
to commit collective suicide.

192
00:28:50,727 --> 00:28:53,776
Maybe we can try to figure out

193
00:28:53,887 --> 00:28:57,289
what each of us could do,
if they came here.

194
00:28:59,207 --> 00:29:01,130
What's there to do?

195
00:29:01,247 --> 00:29:02,737
Look at the Croatians.

196
00:29:04,127 --> 00:29:05,936
Play hide-and-seek.

197
00:29:57,287 --> 00:29:58,777
Cough.

198
00:30:04,287 --> 00:30:05,527
Once more.

199
00:30:14,927 --> 00:30:17,009
You'll outlive us all.

200
00:31:17,247 --> 00:31:18,737
Hello, haji.

201
00:31:19,927 --> 00:31:21,167
Still got your head?

202
00:31:21,287 --> 00:31:23,813
I don't care.
They can have my head.

203
00:31:23,927 --> 00:31:26,453
- May I?
- Sure. Be my guest.

204
00:32:07,887 --> 00:32:09,616
The roads are blocked.

205
00:32:10,127 --> 00:32:12,414
I won't go to Meznir today.

206
00:32:12,527 --> 00:32:14,336
Not after what happened.

207
00:33:48,687 --> 00:33:51,850
We don't need anything.
I'll let you know.

208
00:33:55,087 --> 00:33:57,089
Christmas is in a week.

209
00:33:57,207 --> 00:34:00,734
You know it's important
for us to be here together.

210
00:34:03,887 --> 00:34:05,377
Thanks again.

211
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:07,617
Talk to you soon.

212
00:34:15,007 --> 00:34:18,614
"Accepting our powerlessness
and our extreme poverty

213
00:34:18,727 --> 00:34:22,812
is an invitation,
an urgent appeal to create with others

214
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:25,168
relationships not based on power."

215
00:34:25,287 --> 00:34:28,689
"Recognizing my weaknesses,
I accept those of others."

216
00:34:28,807 --> 00:34:31,936
"I can bear them,
make them mine

217
00:34:32,047 --> 00:34:33,856
in imitation of Christ."

218
00:34:33,967 --> 00:34:37,130
"Such an attitude transforms us
for our mission."

219
00:34:37,247 --> 00:34:40,296
"Weakness in itself is not a virtue,

220
00:34:40,407 --> 00:34:43,775
but the expression
of a fundamental reality

221
00:34:43,887 --> 00:34:48,848
which must constantly
be refashioned by faith,

222
00:34:48,967 --> 00:34:51,413
hope and love."

223
00:34:51,967 --> 00:34:54,732
"The apostle's weakness
is like Christ's,

224
00:34:54,847 --> 00:34:57,578
rooted in the mystery of Easter

225
00:34:57,687 --> 00:34:59,769
and the strength of the spirit."

226
00:34:59,887 --> 00:35:03,130
"It is neither passivity
nor resignation."

227
00:35:03,247 --> 00:35:05,170
"It requires great courage

228
00:35:05,287 --> 00:35:08,734
and incites one
to defend justice and truth

229
00:35:08,847 --> 00:35:11,418
and to denounce the temptation

230
00:35:11,527 --> 00:35:14,417
of force and power."

231
00:35:14,527 --> 00:35:16,017
End of article.

232
00:35:16,607 --> 00:35:18,177
New article.

233
00:35:18,287 --> 00:35:21,655
By Carlo Carretto,
"The God Who is Coming".

234
00:35:21,767 --> 00:35:23,610
"Often throughout my life

235
00:35:23,727 --> 00:35:27,448
I've wondered
how God could act so strangely."

236
00:35:27,567 --> 00:35:30,491
"Why does he stay silent so long?"

237
00:35:30,607 --> 00:35:33,417
"Why is faith so bitter?"

238
00:35:34,367 --> 00:35:38,497
And nothing exists except love

239
00:35:38,607 --> 00:35:42,737
Except love which now begins

240
00:35:43,327 --> 00:35:47,377
By separating sand from water

241
00:35:47,487 --> 00:35:51,776
God has prepared earth like a cradle

242
00:35:51,887 --> 00:35:56,893
Far his coming from above

243
00:35:58,047 --> 00:36:00,493
This is the night

244
00:36:00,607 --> 00:36:04,737
Happy night in Palestine

245
00:36:04,847 --> 00:36:08,647
And nothing exists except the Child

246
00:36:08,767 --> 00:36:12,488
Except the Child of life divine

247
00:36:27,487 --> 00:36:28,977
What do you want?

248
00:36:30,567 --> 00:36:32,057
Are you the Pope?

249
00:36:34,047 --> 00:36:35,970
Where's the Pope?

250
00:36:36,087 --> 00:36:38,010
There's no Pope here.

251
00:36:38,127 --> 00:36:39,208
Your leader.

252
00:36:40,327 --> 00:36:41,817
His name!

253
00:36:42,407 --> 00:36:43,897
Brother Christian.

254
00:37:13,607 --> 00:37:15,097
Who are you?

255
00:37:31,287 --> 00:37:32,368
Ali.

256
00:37:37,127 --> 00:37:38,128
Here he is.

257
00:37:38,247 --> 00:37:40,056
This is Christian.

258
00:37:41,287 --> 00:37:42,527
What do you want?

259
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:45,329
This is a house of peace.

260
00:37:47,087 --> 00:37:48,612
Are you Christian?

261
00:37:52,007 --> 00:37:54,169
No weapons allowed here.

262
00:37:54,887 --> 00:37:58,334
If you wish to speak,
you must leave them outside.

263
00:37:58,447 --> 00:37:59,937
Please.

264
00:38:01,967 --> 00:38:03,696
I never part with mine.

265
00:38:04,927 --> 00:38:07,407
Follow me. We'll talk outside.

266
00:38:24,527 --> 00:38:26,336
I need the doc.

267
00:38:31,527 --> 00:38:33,529
He has to come with us.

268
00:38:34,007 --> 00:38:35,497
Impossible.

269
00:38:37,927 --> 00:38:40,407
I have three men wounded
an hour away.

270
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:44,452
He can't leave here. He's sick.
He's old and asthmatic.

271
00:38:45,487 --> 00:38:48,013
Brother Luc sees patients at the clinic.

272
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:52,251
He tends to everyone
who needs his help.

273
00:38:52,367 --> 00:38:55,689
Their identity is not an issue
and never will be.

274
00:38:55,807 --> 00:38:57,491
That's all.

275
00:38:57,607 --> 00:38:59,609
So you can give us medicine.

276
00:39:03,207 --> 00:39:04,732
We're short on supplies.

277
00:39:04,847 --> 00:39:06,770
We see 100 villagers a day.

278
00:39:06,887 --> 00:39:08,377
Enough!

279
00:39:09,567 --> 00:39:11,057
You have no choice!

280
00:39:12,047 --> 00:39:13,537
Yes.

281
00:39:14,767 --> 00:39:16,257
I do.

282
00:39:17,127 --> 00:39:19,129
We can't give what we don't have.

283
00:39:19,247 --> 00:39:22,569
Ask your brothers in the village.
We live modestly.

284
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,529
With products we grow.

285
00:39:27,487 --> 00:39:28,977
You know the Koran?

286
00:39:29,807 --> 00:39:33,812
"Those nearest in love
to the believers

287
00:39:33,927 --> 00:39:36,737
are those who say,
'We are Christians'"

288
00:39:38,127 --> 00:39:40,573
"Among them are priests and monks."

289
00:39:40,687 --> 00:39:43,258
"Priest and monks

290
00:39:43,887 --> 00:39:47,414
and they wax not proud."

291
00:39:48,727 --> 00:39:51,207
That's why
we're close to our neighbors.

292
00:40:05,487 --> 00:40:07,296
Come on, let's go.

293
00:40:19,007 --> 00:40:21,328
Tonight is different from other nights.

294
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:28,968
Why?

295
00:40:29,087 --> 00:40:30,293
It's Christmas.

296
00:40:30,407 --> 00:40:34,378
We celebrate the birth
of the Prince of peace.

297
00:40:38,327 --> 00:40:40,091
The Prince of peace?

298
00:40:40,207 --> 00:40:41,618
Sidna-Aissa.

299
00:40:44,687 --> 00:40:45,688
Jesus.

300
00:40:59,047 --> 00:41:00,697
I'm sorry, then.

301
00:41:01,607 --> 00:41:03,097
I didn't know.

302
00:41:43,807 --> 00:41:45,536
Christophe?

303
00:41:45,647 --> 00:41:47,137
Michel?

304
00:41:54,367 --> 00:41:55,857
Come out now.

305
00:41:57,127 --> 00:41:58,777
They're gone.

306
00:41:58,887 --> 00:42:01,288
We're fine. We made it.

307
00:42:24,727 --> 00:42:27,537
Hold this down gently.

308
00:42:36,007 --> 00:42:38,009
You can let go.

309
00:42:44,327 --> 00:42:47,410
You'll be fine. Don't worry.

310
00:42:54,727 --> 00:42:57,810
This is the night

311
00:42:57,927 --> 00:43:02,535
The immense night of origins

312
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:07,696
And nothing exists except love

313
00:43:07,807 --> 00:43:13,211
Except love which now begins

314
00:43:13,327 --> 00:43:17,377
By separating sand from water

315
00:43:17,487 --> 00:43:22,618
Gad has prepared the earth like a cradle

316
00:43:22,727 --> 00:43:28,689
Far his coming from above

317
00:43:30,727 --> 00:43:33,697
This is the night

318
00:43:33,807 --> 00:43:39,450
The happy night of Palestine

319
00:43:39,567 --> 00:43:44,175
And nothing exists except the Child

320
00:43:44,287 --> 00:43:50,090
Except the Child of life divine

321
00:43:50,607 --> 00:43:54,817
By taking flesh of our flesh

322
00:43:54,927 --> 00:44:00,252
God our desert did refresh

323
00:44:00,367 --> 00:44:06,295
And made a land of boundless spring

324
00:44:08,327 --> 00:44:11,456
This is the night

325
00:44:11,567 --> 00:44:17,290
The long night in which we grope

326
00:44:17,407 --> 00:44:22,254
And nothing exists except this place

327
00:44:22,367 --> 00:44:28,488
Except this place of ruined hope

328
00:44:28,607 --> 00:44:32,657
By stopping in our abode

329
00:44:32,767 --> 00:44:37,694
God, as with the bush, did forebode

330
00:44:37,807 --> 00:44:44,213
The world on which fire would fall

331
00:45:25,367 --> 00:45:26,607
Why...

332
00:45:27,247 --> 00:45:29,648
...not give them medicine?

333
00:45:30,167 --> 00:45:31,657
We have enough.

334
00:45:32,407 --> 00:45:36,298
If you have medicine,
I'd like to know about it.

335
00:45:37,567 --> 00:45:39,854
We can't start negotiating.

336
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:42,891
Every day they'll ask for more.

337
00:45:44,327 --> 00:45:45,817
I agree with Luc.

338
00:45:46,727 --> 00:45:48,855
Don't forget, I was held at gunpoint.

339
00:45:51,287 --> 00:45:54,689
If we stay,
our lives would be at risk every day.

340
00:45:55,967 --> 00:45:57,810
I became a monk to live.

341
00:45:58,727 --> 00:46:01,651
Not to sit back
and have my throat slit.

342
00:46:01,767 --> 00:46:03,417
You're right, Celestin.

343
00:46:03,527 --> 00:46:06,007
We shouldn't be seeking martyrdom.

344
00:46:08,407 --> 00:46:10,216
Maybe we should leave.

345
00:46:11,567 --> 00:46:14,571
Or at least
take refuge in a safer place.

346
00:46:15,527 --> 00:46:17,894
I think that Celestin

347
00:46:18,007 --> 00:46:20,487
is asking a good question.

348
00:46:21,967 --> 00:46:25,767
They've come once.
They'll be back sooner than we think.

349
00:46:28,007 --> 00:46:31,056
The fact that
you refused all their demands

350
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:34,330
could be taken as a declaration of war.

351
00:46:35,447 --> 00:46:37,768
Look what they did to the Croatians.

352
00:46:38,367 --> 00:46:42,088
If they'd wanted to kill us,
we'd be dead already.

353
00:46:43,087 --> 00:46:46,250
Maybe Fayattia
isn't the only one who decides.

354
00:46:46,687 --> 00:46:49,691
Maybe others will come back tomorrow.

355
00:46:53,487 --> 00:46:55,296
There's another solution.

356
00:46:57,207 --> 00:46:58,697
Leave for good.

357
00:47:01,167 --> 00:47:05,252
We should each decide
according to his own conscience.

358
00:47:06,487 --> 00:47:08,455
Go back to France

359
00:47:08,567 --> 00:47:11,969
or to another,
safer monastery in Africa.

360
00:47:13,327 --> 00:47:15,409
To leave is to run away.

361
00:47:16,647 --> 00:47:19,617
And to leave the village
to the terrorists.

362
00:47:20,207 --> 00:47:23,814
We'd do it gradually,
so the villagers won't worry.

363
00:47:23,927 --> 00:47:25,929
That won't change a thing.

364
00:47:26,487 --> 00:47:30,537
The Good Shepherd doesn't
abandon his flock to the wolves.

365
00:47:34,687 --> 00:47:37,850
We should each express our opinion
about leaving.

366
00:47:49,807 --> 00:47:51,218
Jean-Pierre?

367
00:47:51,327 --> 00:47:52,817
We stay.

368
00:47:54,327 --> 00:47:56,728
Since when do we yield to arms?

369
00:47:57,927 --> 00:47:58,928
Paul?

370
00:48:00,367 --> 00:48:02,210
I think we should leave.

371
00:48:02,327 --> 00:48:03,817
Gradually.

372
00:48:05,847 --> 00:48:07,372
Celestin?

373
00:48:07,487 --> 00:48:10,058
I'm ill. I want to leave.

374
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:13,337
Luc?

375
00:48:14,567 --> 00:48:16,569
To leave is to die.

376
00:48:17,727 --> 00:48:19,217
I'm staying.

377
00:48:20,527 --> 00:48:22,017
Michel?

378
00:48:25,647 --> 00:48:27,775
I have no one else, anywhere.

379
00:48:28,367 --> 00:48:30,051
I'll stay.

380
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:35,170
Amédée?

381
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:37,289
I don't know yet.

382
00:48:39,767 --> 00:48:41,656
We need to think...

383
00:48:43,487 --> 00:48:45,888
...and pray together.

384
00:48:50,007 --> 00:48:52,089
I think we should leave.

385
00:48:57,967 --> 00:48:59,776
And you, Christian?

386
00:49:03,967 --> 00:49:07,449
I agree with Amédée.
it's too early to decide.

387
00:49:16,367 --> 00:49:18,449
Help will come from the Lord.

388
00:49:18,567 --> 00:49:20,968
Who made heaven and earth.

389
00:51:11,647 --> 00:51:18,769
We do not know your mystery

390
00:51:19,527 --> 00:51:23,168
Infinite love

391
00:51:23,287 --> 00:51:26,814
But you do have a heart

392
00:51:27,567 --> 00:51:33,973
For you seek the prodigal son

393
00:51:34,087 --> 00:51:38,411
And hold against your breast

394
00:51:38,847 --> 00:51:43,330
This troublesome child

395
00:51:43,927 --> 00:51:49,138
Which is the world of mortals

396
00:51:52,647 --> 00:52:01,453
We do not see your face

397
00:52:01,567 --> 00:52:05,288
Infinite love

398
00:52:05,407 --> 00:52:10,015
But you do have eyes

399
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:16,851
For you weep through the oppressed

400
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:21,450
And look upon us

401
00:52:21,567 --> 00:52:26,607
With a shining gaze

402
00:52:27,247 --> 00:52:34,335
That reveals your forgiveness

403
00:54:05,927 --> 00:54:08,737
I fear for the fate of this country.

404
00:54:09,487 --> 00:54:13,094
Yesterday two women teachers
were found murdered.

405
00:54:13,207 --> 00:54:16,211
For telling teenagers
falling in love is normal,

406
00:54:16,327 --> 00:54:18,216
that they're allowed to.

407
00:54:18,327 --> 00:54:22,252
It's a 15-year-old girl
who tipped off the extremists.

408
00:54:22,367 --> 00:54:24,688
We're as sad as you are.

409
00:54:25,847 --> 00:54:27,497
What do you know?

410
00:54:28,127 --> 00:54:29,856
This is my country.

411
00:54:30,407 --> 00:54:33,934
Besides being sad,
I'm tired of not seeing it grow up.

412
00:54:34,047 --> 00:54:38,416
And despite what you think,
I blame French colonization.

413
00:54:38,527 --> 00:54:40,655
That organized plundering.

414
00:54:46,167 --> 00:54:47,657
For you.

415
00:54:58,407 --> 00:55:00,614
MINISTRY OF THE INTERIOR

416
00:55:00,727 --> 00:55:02,377
They mean business.

417
00:55:04,767 --> 00:55:06,292
They're giving you orders.

418
00:55:09,687 --> 00:55:12,133
No one other than ourselves

419
00:55:12,247 --> 00:55:14,614
can decide that we must leave.

420
00:55:14,727 --> 00:55:16,172
I'd have been surprised.

421
00:55:16,287 --> 00:55:18,176
Really surprised.

422
00:55:18,287 --> 00:55:20,938
Your stubbornness is getting dangerous.

423
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:25,977
Look at all these people.

424
00:55:28,807 --> 00:55:30,730
They're at home here.

425
00:55:31,487 --> 00:55:34,934
They're terrorized.
They all wish they could leave.

426
00:55:35,047 --> 00:55:37,209
They have no choice, no money.

427
00:55:40,687 --> 00:55:43,452
It's not cowardly to want to leave.

428
00:55:43,567 --> 00:55:45,092
It's about being free.

429
00:55:45,207 --> 00:55:47,528
TERROR STRIKES DJELFA

430
00:55:49,407 --> 00:55:51,375
Sooner or later, it'll be you.

431
00:55:52,047 --> 00:55:55,096
No one can control
what's going on these days.

432
00:55:55,207 --> 00:55:57,972
You'll end up
becoming just another pawn.

433
00:55:58,087 --> 00:56:01,330
Your sacrifice
will eventually be exploited.

434
00:56:05,807 --> 00:56:09,129
I've known you for years.
I have respect for you.

435
00:56:09,887 --> 00:56:12,493
And for what your community has done.

436
00:56:13,047 --> 00:56:15,049
Please, go back to France.

437
00:56:36,447 --> 00:56:38,017
Did your car break down?

438
00:56:38,727 --> 00:56:40,934
Is any of you a mechanic?

439
00:56:42,487 --> 00:56:45,696
If you know how to fix it, be my guest.

440
00:56:48,087 --> 00:56:49,577
Should I try?

441
00:56:54,367 --> 00:56:56,768
- Should I try?
- Is it in neutral?

442
00:56:59,527 --> 00:57:01,848
You're in neutral? Go on, try.

443
00:57:44,927 --> 00:57:47,931
Will the village
need the army to protect it?

444
00:57:48,047 --> 00:57:50,732
Because they'll be back someday.

445
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:52,815
Forget the army!

446
00:57:52,927 --> 00:57:54,372
It's a disaster.

447
00:57:54,487 --> 00:57:56,330
The army won't come.

448
00:57:56,447 --> 00:57:58,654
The protection is you.

449
00:57:59,647 --> 00:58:02,969
This village grew up
with the monastery.

450
00:58:04,367 --> 00:58:06,734
Who was that priest, before?

451
00:58:07,407 --> 00:58:09,216
A while back, before the war.

452
00:58:09,887 --> 00:58:11,048
Brother Bernard?

453
00:58:12,247 --> 00:58:13,408
Another one. Old.

454
00:58:13,527 --> 00:58:15,017
Brother Daniel.

455
00:58:15,127 --> 00:58:16,856
That's him.

456
00:58:16,967 --> 00:58:18,378
Brother Daniel.

457
00:58:18,487 --> 00:58:20,933
He told my mother not to stay here.

458
00:58:21,047 --> 00:58:24,369
Move to a city.
There was no more work here.

459
00:58:24,487 --> 00:58:28,651
She made him swear
to say nothing to my father.

460
00:58:29,287 --> 00:58:32,734
Because my mother,
she feels good living here.

461
00:58:32,847 --> 00:58:34,451
Comfortable.

462
00:58:38,807 --> 00:58:41,538
We may be leaving.

463
00:58:42,607 --> 00:58:43,847
Why are you leaving?

464
00:58:49,767 --> 00:58:52,373
We're like birds on a branch.

465
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:54,728
We don't know if we'll leave.

466
00:58:57,567 --> 00:58:58,693
We're the birds.

467
00:58:58,807 --> 00:59:00,491
You're the branch.

468
00:59:00,607 --> 00:59:03,008
If you go, we lose our footing.

469
00:59:14,407 --> 00:59:16,728
Forgive us our trespasses

470
00:59:16,847 --> 00:59:19,009
as we forgive those

471
00:59:19,127 --> 00:59:21,175
who trespass against us,

472
00:59:21,287 --> 00:59:24,496
and lead us not into temptation

473
00:59:24,607 --> 00:59:26,609
but deliver us from evil.

474
00:59:28,727 --> 00:59:31,856
Let us bless the Lord

475
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:36,973
We render thanks unto Him

476
01:00:41,967 --> 01:00:43,969
So you want to leave?

477
01:00:49,527 --> 01:00:51,097
I was thinking that.

478
01:00:54,607 --> 01:00:56,848
I wonder what my life would be.

479
01:01:04,847 --> 01:01:06,656
Your family, in France?

480
01:01:07,367 --> 01:01:08,573
They're worried?

481
01:01:08,687 --> 01:01:11,691
I'm not sure they realize
what's going on here.

482
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:13,809
I haven't said anything.

483
01:01:18,047 --> 01:01:20,778
The last time I saw them,
it was strange.

484
01:01:22,207 --> 01:01:23,697
What do you mean?

485
01:01:31,087 --> 01:01:34,409
We celebrated my mum's 80th birthday
at a restaurant.

486
01:01:35,687 --> 01:01:37,177
I saw everyone.

487
01:01:39,407 --> 01:01:41,614
My sisters were there,

488
01:01:41,727 --> 01:01:44,571
nephews, nieces, my goddaughter.

489
01:01:44,687 --> 01:01:47,008
Everyone was talking, telling stories.

490
01:01:47,127 --> 01:01:48,617
Taking pictures.

491
01:01:48,727 --> 01:01:51,298
They know that's not my thing.

492
01:01:52,727 --> 01:01:56,049
I was there, listening. I was happy.

493
01:01:57,367 --> 01:02:00,576
They put me next to my mum.

494
01:02:02,727 --> 01:02:04,536
And at the same time...

495
01:02:06,687 --> 01:02:08,928
...I was totally out of it.

496
01:02:10,527 --> 01:02:12,017
I was thinking...

497
01:02:13,007 --> 01:02:15,055
...if I stopped everything, if...

498
01:02:16,047 --> 01:02:18,527
I could move back home.

499
01:02:20,127 --> 01:02:22,733
Get back to work, plumbing.

500
01:02:22,847 --> 01:02:24,849
Town council,

501
01:02:25,407 --> 01:02:27,774
ire department, chorus.

502
01:02:28,887 --> 01:02:31,697
Then I thought,
"No, that's not possible."

503
01:02:33,087 --> 01:02:35,408
My life's over there.

504
01:02:38,367 --> 01:02:40,449
Here. With you.

505
01:02:45,927 --> 01:02:48,737
Christian's teaching today
was interesting.

506
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:52,017
Don't you think?

507
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:56,608
Did you understand anything?

508
01:02:58,927 --> 01:03:00,417
Fuck off!

509
01:03:04,887 --> 01:03:06,377
Okay.

510
01:03:08,087 --> 01:03:09,691
Just tired. Not his fault.

511
01:04:08,367 --> 01:04:12,008
"There was a time
when a French toe-punt was crummy

512
01:04:12,127 --> 01:04:16,291
and its Irish equivalent
a mere display of folklore."

513
01:04:19,847 --> 01:04:24,774
"When these damned men didn't know
what to do with their ten digits,

514
01:04:24,887 --> 01:04:29,290
but were great at bending the rules
to piss everyone off."

515
01:04:32,047 --> 01:04:33,537
Is that all?

516
01:04:34,527 --> 01:04:37,656
"Even though we agree
with Mr Break-Neck

517
01:04:37,767 --> 01:04:40,373
that our amiable guests

518
01:04:40,487 --> 01:04:43,058
never closed the game out,

519
01:04:43,167 --> 01:04:46,728
we still wonder whether they prefer,
deep down,

520
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:48,736
the dervish-like scrums

521
01:04:48,847 --> 01:04:52,056
and bleak brawls of yesteryear."

522
01:04:54,247 --> 01:04:57,888
"Back when players
still cared about not being

523
01:04:58,487 --> 01:05:00,569
naughty old men."

524
01:05:02,927 --> 01:05:04,417
A little more.

525
01:07:03,887 --> 01:07:05,855
Help me, help me.

526
01:07:06,687 --> 01:07:08,132
Don't abandon me.

527
01:07:13,207 --> 01:07:15,608
Don't abandon me. Please.

528
01:07:15,727 --> 01:07:17,536
Help me.

529
01:09:37,647 --> 01:09:41,368
Not very pretty. It got infected.

530
01:09:45,447 --> 01:09:48,576
Tell him I'll be giving him two shots.

531
01:09:51,247 --> 01:09:53,932
An antibiotic and a tetanus shot.

532
01:09:59,287 --> 01:10:01,608
He's in pain. He needs medicine.

533
01:10:01,728 --> 01:10:03,810
I'll give him a tranquilizer.

534
01:10:05,008 --> 01:10:07,090
Let's clean this up.

535
01:10:18,567 --> 01:10:20,569
You'll be fine.

536
01:10:23,927 --> 01:10:30,173
Glory be to the Father,
and the Son and the Holy Spirit

537
01:10:30,288 --> 01:10:33,417
World without end

538
01:10:38,887 --> 01:10:42,812
Save us, Lord

539
01:10:42,928 --> 01:10:45,932
Whilst we watch

540
01:10:46,688 --> 01:10:50,659
Keep us, Lord

541
01:10:50,768 --> 01:10:54,056
Whilst we sleep

542
01:10:54,688 --> 01:11:01,048
And we shall watch with Christ

543
01:11:01,168 --> 01:11:07,494
And we shall rest in peace

544
01:12:05,728 --> 01:12:07,218
I'm worn out.

545
01:12:09,127 --> 01:12:10,697
Does Amédée help out?

546
01:12:10,807 --> 01:12:14,448
Fortunately. I don't know
how I'd manage otherwise.

547
01:12:16,647 --> 01:12:20,368
I've never had so many visits.

548
01:12:20,487 --> 01:12:23,218
I'm up to 150 a day.
Can you imagine?

549
01:12:23,328 --> 01:12:27,049
People come from everywhere around.

550
01:12:27,168 --> 01:12:30,092
I'm dealing with new pathologies.

551
01:12:30,208 --> 01:12:33,098
Lots of hypertension.
They're stressed.

552
01:12:33,207 --> 01:12:35,733
Some are in a state of shock.

553
01:12:35,847 --> 01:12:38,532
Not to mention the effect
on the kids.

554
01:12:42,208 --> 01:12:45,769
The villagers may talk
about these men we help.

555
01:12:45,888 --> 01:12:47,378
Be careful.

556
01:12:48,208 --> 01:12:52,930
Throughout my career I've met
all sorts of different people.

557
01:12:53,047 --> 01:12:55,129
Including Nazis.

558
01:12:55,248 --> 01:12:58,058
And even the devil.

559
01:13:05,607 --> 01:13:09,407
I'm not scared of terrorists,
even less of the army.

560
01:13:12,768 --> 01:13:16,090
And I'm not scared of death.
I'm a free man.

561
01:13:26,727 --> 01:13:28,889
Let the free man through!

562
01:13:56,567 --> 01:14:00,174
My men tied him to a truck,
dragged him through the city.

563
01:14:00,288 --> 01:14:01,972
People jumped for joy.

564
01:14:02,087 --> 01:14:03,612
Lucky for him he was dead.

565
01:14:03,728 --> 01:14:06,572
Why didn't you stop them?

566
01:14:06,688 --> 01:14:08,417
Stop them?

567
01:14:08,528 --> 01:14:12,328
Lots of people in the crowd
were victims of his atrocities.

568
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:15,054
Family.
Friends who died.

569
01:14:15,168 --> 01:14:16,738
Many innocent people.

570
01:14:16,848 --> 01:14:19,818
Disgraceful.
No one should be treated this way.

571
01:14:19,927 --> 01:14:22,851
Want to know his favorite torture?

572
01:14:22,967 --> 01:14:26,733
Fayattia and others like him
deserve no compassion.

573
01:14:26,848 --> 01:14:30,011
You're very indulgent
with the terrorists.

574
01:14:30,727 --> 01:14:32,536
Overindulgent.

575
01:14:33,488 --> 01:14:37,015
Rumor has it
he was shielding the monastery.

576
01:14:37,127 --> 01:14:38,936
Did you ever treat them?

577
01:14:40,647 --> 01:14:42,456
Where did you ind him?

578
01:14:44,407 --> 01:14:48,173
Two days ago,
the Walt's car was ambushed.

579
01:14:48,288 --> 01:14:49,778
Near Tikrit.

580
01:14:50,528 --> 01:14:52,132
The terrorists got away.

581
01:14:52,247 --> 01:14:54,978
We found a wounded man
on the ground.

582
01:14:55,088 --> 01:14:57,409
His friends ditched him.

583
01:14:57,527 --> 01:15:01,248
He talked about his mother.
Said his name was Fayattia.

584
01:15:01,367 --> 01:15:03,256
My men let him suffer.

585
01:15:03,367 --> 01:15:06,496
He died
before we could make him our trophy.

586
01:15:07,847 --> 01:15:10,134
How can you be sure it's him?

587
01:15:10,247 --> 01:15:12,898
Why do you think I asked you here?

588
01:15:32,647 --> 01:15:34,012
So?

589
01:15:39,088 --> 01:15:40,453
It's him.

590
01:16:07,328 --> 01:16:09,330
Get out. Go on.

591
01:16:09,447 --> 01:16:10,687
Outside.

592
01:16:24,407 --> 01:16:26,216
I sleep badly.

593
01:16:28,448 --> 01:16:30,530
The slightest noise wakes me.

594
01:16:31,648 --> 01:16:33,298
I think over my life.

595
01:16:36,167 --> 01:16:37,657
My choices.

596
01:16:41,968 --> 01:16:44,369
As a kid I wanted to be a missionary.

597
01:16:47,527 --> 01:16:50,690
Dying for my faith
shouldn't keep me up nights.

598
01:16:58,167 --> 01:17:02,092
Dying here,
here and now,

599
01:17:02,208 --> 01:17:04,210
does it serve a purpose?

600
01:17:07,888 --> 01:17:09,697
I don't know.

601
01:17:10,848 --> 01:17:12,850
I feel like I'm going mad.

602
01:17:14,807 --> 01:17:17,014
It's true that staying here...

603
01:17:18,368 --> 01:17:20,848
...is as mad as becoming a monk.

604
01:17:26,128 --> 01:17:27,618
Remember.

605
01:17:28,807 --> 01:17:31,538
You've already given your life.

606
01:17:32,528 --> 01:17:35,054
You gave it by following Christ.

607
01:17:35,168 --> 01:17:37,694
When you decided to leave everything.

608
01:17:37,808 --> 01:17:41,574
Your life,
your family, your country.

609
01:17:41,687 --> 01:17:44,418
The family you could have raised.

610
01:17:44,528 --> 01:17:46,769
I don't know if it's true anymore.

611
01:17:49,568 --> 01:17:51,058
I pray.

612
01:17:53,367 --> 01:17:55,176
And I hear nothing.

613
01:17:59,847 --> 01:18:01,337
I don't get it.

614
01:18:03,088 --> 01:18:05,090
Why be martyrs?

615
01:18:05,527 --> 01:18:07,336
For God?

616
01:18:07,447 --> 01:18:08,937
To be heroes?

617
01:18:09,047 --> 01:18:11,493
To prove we're the best?

618
01:18:11,607 --> 01:18:14,770
We're martyrs out of love,
out of fidelity.

619
01:18:16,487 --> 01:18:17,977
If death...

620
01:18:19,687 --> 01:18:21,815
...overtakes us, despite ourselves,

621
01:18:21,927 --> 01:18:24,009
because up to the end,

622
01:18:24,128 --> 01:18:27,894
up to the end we'll try to avoid it,

623
01:18:28,007 --> 01:18:30,897
our mission here
is to be brothers to all.

624
01:18:33,248 --> 01:18:37,492
Remember that love
is eternal hope.

625
01:18:38,928 --> 01:18:41,579
Love endures everything.

626
01:18:47,248 --> 01:18:48,738
I'm sorry.

627
01:18:59,648 --> 01:19:03,289
Like patched earth

628
01:19:03,408 --> 01:19:07,811
I stand before you, Lord

629
01:19:19,088 --> 01:19:21,898
O Lord, hear my prayer

630
01:19:22,007 --> 01:19:25,250
Listen to my cry for mercy

631
01:19:25,367 --> 01:19:28,098
In your faithfulness, answer me

632
01:19:28,208 --> 01:19:31,769
Enter not into judgment
with your servant

633
01:19:31,888 --> 01:19:35,938
For no man living
is righteous before you

634
01:19:36,048 --> 01:19:39,495
The enemy persecutes my soul

635
01:19:39,607 --> 01:19:43,009
He has smitten my life to the ground

636
01:19:43,127 --> 01:19:46,973
He has made me dwell in darkness

637
01:19:47,088 --> 01:19:50,695
With those long dead

638
01:19:50,807 --> 01:19:54,368
My spirit grows faint within me

639
01:19:54,487 --> 01:19:59,095
My heart within me, dismayed

640
01:19:59,207 --> 01:20:01,938
Answer me quickly, O Lord

641
01:20:02,048 --> 01:20:05,018
My spirit fails

642
01:20:05,127 --> 01:20:08,256
Do not hide your face from me

643
01:20:08,368 --> 01:20:11,895
Lest I be like them
who fall into the pit

644
01:20:12,848 --> 01:20:15,374
We've received so many letters recently.

645
01:20:15,488 --> 01:20:17,297
People are worried.

646
01:20:18,288 --> 01:20:20,290
I can't answer them all.

647
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:26,254
There's that French journalist
who wants to meet us.

648
01:20:26,727 --> 01:20:28,809
I don't know what to tell her.

649
01:20:29,888 --> 01:20:33,973
We shouldn't expose ourselves further
by doing publicity.

650
01:20:35,168 --> 01:20:36,658
Of course, but...

651
01:20:38,048 --> 01:20:41,530
...it's a way of making
people understand our choices.

652
01:20:42,368 --> 01:20:45,178
To show that
amid all this drama,

653
01:20:45,287 --> 01:20:48,575
for people here,
there's reason for hope.

654
01:20:49,047 --> 01:20:52,972
You know,
hope is not what interests journalists.

655
01:20:53,088 --> 01:20:54,453
It doesn't mobilize them.

656
01:20:54,567 --> 01:20:56,217
Exactly.

657
01:20:56,327 --> 01:20:58,329
Maybe we should mobilize them.

658
01:21:03,287 --> 01:21:05,767
I suggest we take a vote.

659
01:21:05,888 --> 01:21:09,893
To see if we're all of one mind.

660
01:21:11,927 --> 01:21:14,134
Who wants to leave?

661
01:21:16,688 --> 01:21:21,057
I've already told you
my position on this matter

662
01:21:21,168 --> 01:21:25,298
and my calling is to be here,
with everyone.

663
01:21:27,207 --> 01:21:29,289
I don't see myself leaving.

664
01:21:37,127 --> 01:21:39,698
Leaving would lead nowhere.

665
01:21:43,568 --> 01:21:45,809
I'm not ready to leave myself.

666
01:21:47,808 --> 01:21:50,493
Last night I thought about leaving.

667
01:21:50,608 --> 01:21:52,690
I'm not comfortable with it.

668
01:21:54,007 --> 01:21:55,850
Not at peace.

669
01:21:56,647 --> 01:22:00,288
Deciding to run off like that
makes no sense.

670
01:22:01,008 --> 01:22:04,296
We didn't come here
for our own personal interest.

671
01:22:07,047 --> 01:22:10,608
I still think that our mission here
is not finished.

672
01:22:11,927 --> 01:22:13,417
I'm staying.

673
01:22:16,327 --> 01:22:19,092
I prayed all morning
while I was cooking.

674
01:22:19,888 --> 01:22:21,538
The disciple

675
01:22:21,648 --> 01:22:23,730
is not above his master.

676
01:22:27,047 --> 01:22:29,493
This is no time for me to stray.

677
01:22:31,207 --> 01:22:33,574
Let God set the table here.

678
01:22:34,528 --> 01:22:36,018
For everyone.

679
01:22:36,768 --> 01:22:38,577
Friends and enemies.

680
01:22:44,087 --> 01:22:46,089
And you, Christian?

681
01:22:50,608 --> 01:22:54,135
Wildflowers don't move
to ind the sun's rays.

682
01:22:55,527 --> 01:22:58,610
God makes them fecund

683
01:22:58,727 --> 01:23:00,729
wherever they are.

684
01:23:03,648 --> 01:23:05,969
Who prefers to stay?

685
01:24:41,447 --> 01:24:42,937
You.

686
01:24:45,927 --> 01:24:49,329
You envelop me, hold me,
surround me.

687
01:24:49,968 --> 01:24:51,777
You embrace me.

688
01:24:53,088 --> 01:24:54,578
And I love you.

689
01:25:41,968 --> 01:25:44,130
- Where do you live?
- In town.

690
01:25:44,247 --> 01:25:46,170
- ID.
- I don't have it on me.

691
01:25:46,288 --> 01:25:48,575
- Where do you live?
- Just nearby.

692
01:25:48,688 --> 01:25:50,338
- ID.
- I don't have them.

693
01:25:50,448 --> 01:25:52,212
- Where do you live?
- The village.

694
01:25:54,567 --> 01:25:56,057
Stop this nonsense!

695
01:25:56,167 --> 01:25:58,898
These women and children
are here to be treated.

696
01:25:59,008 --> 01:26:01,579
This is not a police station!

697
01:26:01,687 --> 01:26:03,496
Enough!

698
01:26:07,367 --> 01:26:10,337
Unbelievable.
Sit down.

699
01:26:12,448 --> 01:26:14,450
Follow me.

700
01:27:11,527 --> 01:27:14,849
I recently read
this pensee of Pascal's,

701
01:27:14,967 --> 01:27:19,097
"Men never do evil
so completely and cheerfully

702
01:27:19,207 --> 01:27:22,575
as when they do it
from religious conviction."

703
01:27:22,688 --> 01:27:24,850
Here it is mayhem

704
01:27:24,967 --> 01:27:26,731
and violence.

705
01:27:30,087 --> 01:27:34,012
We are in a high-risk situation,

706
01:27:34,128 --> 01:27:38,178
but we persist in our faith
and our confidence in God.

707
01:27:38,288 --> 01:27:41,497
It is through poverty, failure and death

708
01:27:41,607 --> 01:27:43,735
that we advance towards him.

709
01:27:47,728 --> 01:27:49,696
Heavy devastating downpours

710
01:27:49,808 --> 01:27:53,017
have put no damper
on the spread of violence.

711
01:27:54,567 --> 01:27:57,013
Two opponents,
one clutching onto power,

712
01:27:57,127 --> 01:27:59,095
the other out to seize it.

713
01:27:59,207 --> 01:28:01,414
They'll fight to the bitter end.

714
01:28:01,527 --> 01:28:04,053
I don't know when or how it will end.

715
01:28:04,167 --> 01:28:06,738
In the meantime, I do my duty...

716
01:28:06,848 --> 01:28:08,976
Caring for the poor and the sick,

717
01:28:09,088 --> 01:28:13,252
awaiting the day I close my eyes.
Dear friend,

718
01:28:14,247 --> 01:28:17,649
pray for me, that my leaving this world

719
01:28:17,767 --> 01:28:21,408
will in the peace and joy of Jesus.

720
01:29:27,607 --> 01:29:29,132
O Father

721
01:29:30,048 --> 01:29:32,415
Of light

722
01:29:34,848 --> 01:29:39,570
Eternal light!

723
01:29:39,687 --> 01:29:45,615
And source of all light

724
01:29:47,568 --> 01:29:53,416
You illuminate us,
at the threshold of night

725
01:29:53,527 --> 01:29:59,534
With the radiance of your face

726
01:30:01,847 --> 01:30:06,171
The shadows, for you

727
01:30:06,288 --> 01:30:10,737
Are not shadows

728
01:30:11,767 --> 01:30:15,089
For you, night

729
01:30:15,207 --> 01:30:20,657
ls as clear as day

730
01:30:24,087 --> 01:30:30,174
May our prayers before you

731
01:30:30,288 --> 01:30:35,658
Rise like incense

732
01:30:37,168 --> 01:30:44,290
And our hands like the evening offering

733
01:31:16,448 --> 01:31:17,938
Welcome, Bruno.

734
01:31:26,407 --> 01:31:27,897
Celestin.

735
01:31:29,127 --> 01:31:30,617
Christophe.

736
01:31:37,888 --> 01:31:39,378
Hello, Luc.

737
01:31:41,607 --> 01:31:43,097
Jean-Pierre.

738
01:31:46,928 --> 01:31:48,418
Amédée.

739
01:32:20,848 --> 01:32:23,215
- Hosts.
- For me.

740
01:32:23,328 --> 01:32:25,808
For us.
For us all.

741
01:32:26,967 --> 01:32:28,935
Medicine.

742
01:32:29,047 --> 01:32:30,572
For Luc.

743
01:32:32,727 --> 01:32:34,536
Lots of medicine.

744
01:32:36,327 --> 01:32:38,455
- You found it?
- I found your book.

745
01:32:38,567 --> 01:32:40,057
Is it the right one?

746
01:32:40,167 --> 01:32:41,896
"The Chosen".

747
01:32:43,568 --> 01:32:44,854
Cheese!

748
01:32:47,728 --> 01:32:49,537
Any news of Brother Didier?

749
01:32:50,887 --> 01:32:53,049
Of course he said to say hello.

750
01:32:53,168 --> 01:32:55,899
And I have a letter for you.

751
01:32:57,527 --> 01:33:00,417
So how was your trip?
How long was it?

752
01:33:00,528 --> 01:33:03,975
It took a while
to come from the diocese.

753
01:33:04,087 --> 01:33:07,728
At least three hours.
There were three checkpoints!

754
01:33:07,847 --> 01:33:11,169
Between the last two checkpoints

755
01:33:11,287 --> 01:33:13,938
there was a bus burning
on the roadside.

756
01:33:14,048 --> 01:33:15,573
Smoke coming out of it.

757
01:33:15,687 --> 01:33:20,375
And we didn't know
if the checkpoints were real or fake.

758
01:33:20,487 --> 01:33:22,296
On the way here,

759
01:33:23,047 --> 01:33:26,017
as we got closer,
there were fewer vehicles.

760
01:33:26,128 --> 01:33:27,937
Many soldiers?

761
01:33:28,727 --> 01:33:30,889
Yes, near the checkpoints.

762
01:33:34,608 --> 01:33:36,531
They were all very tense.

763
01:33:36,647 --> 01:33:40,174
Out of the question
to speak to them.

764
01:33:40,288 --> 01:33:42,450
- How do we stand?
- However we want.

765
01:33:42,567 --> 01:33:44,569
Short ones up front.

766
01:33:50,007 --> 01:33:51,816
Squeeze in closer.

767
01:33:53,248 --> 01:33:54,738
Ready?

768
01:33:56,247 --> 01:33:57,737
Set...

769
01:33:58,887 --> 01:34:00,377
Let's take another.

770
01:34:02,208 --> 01:34:03,698
Smile a little.

771
01:34:34,327 --> 01:34:36,978
I've often thought of that time.

772
01:34:39,287 --> 01:34:40,777
That time...

773
01:34:41,847 --> 01:34:44,214
...when Ali Fayattia and his men left.

774
01:34:49,047 --> 01:34:50,856
Once they were gone...

775
01:34:52,128 --> 01:34:55,132
...all we had left to do was to live.

776
01:34:56,647 --> 01:34:59,730
And the first thing we did was...

777
01:35:01,687 --> 01:35:03,769
...two hours later.

778
01:35:03,888 --> 01:35:07,529
We celebrated
the Christmas Vigil and Mass.

779
01:35:08,448 --> 01:35:10,291
It's what we had to do.

780
01:35:10,967 --> 01:35:12,457
It's what we did.

781
01:35:13,767 --> 01:35:15,895
And we sang the Mass.

782
01:35:16,567 --> 01:35:21,494
We welcomed that child
who was born for us...

783
01:35:22,647 --> 01:35:25,298
...absolutely helpless and...

784
01:35:26,608 --> 01:35:29,088
...and already so threatened.

785
01:35:32,567 --> 01:35:34,057
Afterwards,

786
01:35:34,167 --> 01:35:38,889
we found salvation
in undertaking our daily tasks.

787
01:35:40,208 --> 01:35:42,939
The kitchen, the garden,

788
01:35:43,047 --> 01:35:45,368
the prayers, the bells.

789
01:35:45,488 --> 01:35:47,490
Day after day.

790
01:35:51,408 --> 01:35:54,059
We had to resist the violence.

791
01:35:56,768 --> 01:35:58,816
And day after day, I...

792
01:35:59,607 --> 01:36:04,169
I think each of us discovered

793
01:36:04,288 --> 01:36:08,850
that to which Jesus Christ
beckons us.

794
01:36:10,247 --> 01:36:11,737
It's...

795
01:36:12,327 --> 01:36:13,658
...to be born.

796
01:36:15,207 --> 01:36:19,929
Our identities as men
go from one birth to another.

797
01:36:20,048 --> 01:36:24,019
And from birth to birth,
we'll each end up

798
01:36:24,128 --> 01:36:27,416
bringing to the world
the child of God that we are.

799
01:36:27,527 --> 01:36:29,734
The Incarnation, for us,

800
01:36:29,847 --> 01:36:32,851
is to allow the filial reality of Jesus

801
01:36:32,967 --> 01:36:35,447
to embody itself in our humanity.

802
01:36:38,128 --> 01:36:41,450
The mystery of Incarnation remains...

803
01:36:42,567 --> 01:36:45,138
...what we are going to live.

804
01:36:45,767 --> 01:36:50,807
In this way
what we've already lived here takes root

805
01:36:50,928 --> 01:36:55,934
as well as what we're going to live
in the future.

806
01:36:56,688 --> 01:37:01,489
"Whoever tries to save his life
shall lose it,

807
01:37:02,327 --> 01:37:05,171
and whoever shall lose it,
preserves it."

808
01:37:07,328 --> 01:37:12,129
"I tell you, on that night,
two people shall be in one bed."

809
01:37:12,247 --> 01:37:16,297
"One shall be taken, the other left."

810
01:37:16,407 --> 01:37:19,536
"Two women shall
be grinding grain together."

811
01:37:19,648 --> 01:37:24,017
"One shall be taken, the other left.

812
01:37:24,128 --> 01:37:28,133
"The disciples asked him,
'Where, Lord?'"

813
01:37:28,608 --> 01:37:32,818
"He answered,
'Where there is a body,

814
01:37:32,928 --> 01:37:36,171
'there too the vultures shall gather.'"

815
01:37:44,288 --> 01:37:46,450
The Gospel of the Lord.

816
01:37:46,567 --> 01:37:49,650
Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ.

817
01:37:57,648 --> 01:37:59,138
The body of Christ.

818
01:38:06,448 --> 01:38:07,938
The body of Christ.

819
01:38:37,808 --> 01:38:42,132
Lord, blessed art thou for this meal
which unites us as brothers

820
01:38:42,368 --> 01:38:44,450
now and...

821
01:38:45,808 --> 01:38:48,334
...world without end.

822
01:43:29,327 --> 01:43:30,817
Hurry up!

823
01:43:49,007 --> 01:43:50,497
Move!

824
01:43:52,928 --> 01:43:54,418
Hurry, faster!

825
01:43:59,047 --> 01:44:01,493
Hurry, get dressed.

826
01:44:01,607 --> 01:44:03,097
I just got here.

827
01:44:04,088 --> 01:44:05,089
I can't.

828
01:44:23,448 --> 01:44:25,291
I said don't push!

829
01:44:26,328 --> 01:44:30,219
Careful with that medicine.
it's for the children, not you.

830
01:44:30,328 --> 01:44:31,898
It's very precious.

831
01:44:32,728 --> 01:44:35,174
Stop pushing me! That's enough!

832
01:44:35,288 --> 01:44:37,097
Calm down!

833
01:46:57,807 --> 01:47:00,014
I am Brother Paul.

834
01:47:00,128 --> 01:47:02,938
A monk at the Monastere de l'Atlas.

835
01:47:03,047 --> 01:47:05,368
And I'm in good health.

836
01:47:09,688 --> 01:47:12,168
I am Brother Celestin.

837
01:47:14,567 --> 01:47:16,968
I'm 63.

838
01:47:19,968 --> 01:47:23,131
A monk at the Monastere de l'Atlas.

839
01:47:25,327 --> 01:47:27,136
I'm in good health.

840
01:47:29,728 --> 01:47:31,218
Your turn, Luc.

841
01:47:38,008 --> 01:47:41,729
My name is Brother Luc.

842
01:47:42,407 --> 01:47:44,489
From the Monastere de l'Atlas.

843
01:47:46,008 --> 01:47:50,889
I heard what they're saying
on the news.

844
01:47:51,008 --> 01:47:57,493
I've been taken hostage
with my colleagues by the Jama...

845
01:47:58,368 --> 01:48:00,848
- What's it called?
- Islamiyya.

846
01:48:01,487 --> 01:48:04,058
Jama Islamiyya, that's it.

847
01:48:08,128 --> 01:48:09,618
Your turn, Christian.

848
01:48:15,128 --> 01:48:17,608
In the early hours of Friday morning,

849
01:48:17,728 --> 01:48:23,497
the Mujahideen read us the bayan
of the Jama Islamiyya Musalaha.

850
01:48:23,608 --> 01:48:25,770
- It says...
- Signed by?

851
01:48:27,288 --> 01:48:30,212
Signed by Abu Abderrahmane Amine.

852
01:48:30,328 --> 01:48:35,653
It says we're being held hostage and
demands that the French government

853
01:48:35,768 --> 01:48:42,094
free hostages belonging to their group
in exchange for our liberation.

854
01:48:43,328 --> 01:48:45,899
This exchange is non-negotiable.

855
01:48:48,687 --> 01:48:50,496
Did you hear?

856
01:49:11,887 --> 01:49:15,778
Should it ever befall me,
and it could happen today,

857
01:49:15,887 --> 01:49:20,575
to be a victim of the terrorism
swallowing up all foreigners here,

858
01:49:21,528 --> 01:49:26,534
I would like my community,
my church, my family,

859
01:49:26,648 --> 01:49:30,698
to remember that my life was given
to God and to this country.

860
01:49:31,928 --> 01:49:34,534
That the Unique Master of all life

861
01:49:34,648 --> 01:49:37,652
was no stranger
to this brutal departure.

862
01:49:38,447 --> 01:49:42,133
And that my death is the same as
so many other violent ones,

863
01:49:42,247 --> 01:49:45,296
consigned to the apathy of oblivion.

864
01:49:45,927 --> 01:49:50,888
I've lived enough to know
I am complicit in the evil that, alas,

865
01:49:51,008 --> 01:49:52,498
prevails over the world

866
01:49:53,127 --> 01:49:56,051
and the evil that will smite me blindly.

867
01:49:56,167 --> 01:49:58,898
I could never desire such a death.

868
01:49:59,008 --> 01:50:02,979
I could never feel gladdened
that these people I love

869
01:50:03,087 --> 01:50:06,170
be accused randomly of my murder.

870
01:50:07,328 --> 01:50:10,138
I know the contempt
felt for the people here,

871
01:50:10,247 --> 01:50:11,976
indiscriminately.

872
01:50:12,088 --> 01:50:16,969
And I know how Islam is distorted
by a certain Islamism.

873
01:50:17,088 --> 01:50:20,058
This country, and Islam, for me

874
01:50:20,167 --> 01:50:21,692
are something different.

875
01:50:21,807 --> 01:50:24,651
They're a body and a soul.

876
01:50:25,248 --> 01:50:27,330
My death, of course,

877
01:50:27,448 --> 01:50:32,409
will quickly vindicate
those who called me naive or idealistic,

878
01:50:32,527 --> 01:50:37,488
but they must know that I will be freed
of a burning curiosity

879
01:50:37,607 --> 01:50:41,657
and, God willing,
will immerse my gaze in the Father's

880
01:50:42,407 --> 01:50:47,208
and contemplate with him
his children of Islam as he sees them.

881
01:50:47,968 --> 01:50:51,734
This thank-you
which encompasses my entire life

882
01:50:52,768 --> 01:50:57,456
includes you, of course,
friends of yesterday and today,

883
01:50:57,568 --> 01:51:00,253
and you too,
friend of the last minute,

884
01:51:00,367 --> 01:51:02,973
who knew not what you were doing.

885
01:51:03,087 --> 01:51:07,137
Yes, to you as well
I address this thank-you

886
01:51:07,247 --> 01:51:10,808
and this farewell
which you envisaged.

887
01:51:10,927 --> 01:51:16,855
May we meet again,
happy thieves in Paradise,

888
01:51:16,967 --> 01:51:20,688
if it pleases God,
the Father of us both.

889
01:51:20,807 --> 01:51:21,968
Amen.

890
01:51:22,087 --> 01:51:23,088
Inchallah.

891
01:54:09,447 --> 01:54:12,291
Christian, Luc, Christophe,
Celestin, Paul, Michel and Bruno

892
01:54:12,408 --> 01:54:13,819
were killed on May 21, 1996.

893
01:54:14,927 --> 01:54:18,727
The identity of their murderers
and the circumstances of their deaths

894
01:54:18,848 --> 01:54:20,498
remain a mystery.

895
01:54:21,208 --> 01:54:23,415
Amédée died on July 27, 2008.

896
01:54:23,527 --> 01:54:25,734
Jean-Pierre is still alive.
He is now 86.
