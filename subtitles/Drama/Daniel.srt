1
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:19,518
Electricity is a form of energy.

2
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,521
It is generated by power sources
driven by water,

3
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:24,524
steam, or atomic fission.

4
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,527
The two leading electric
power producing countries

5
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:31,530
in the world are
the United States of America

6
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:35,034
and the union of the Soviet
socialist republics.

7
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,537
The theory of electricity
is that atoms

8
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,539
gain or lose electrons.

9
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:44,043
Thus become positively
or negatively charged.

10
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,545
In this way,
a current is produced

11
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:49,048
and a current is designed
to flow through a circuit.

12
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,551
In 1889, the first
electric chair

13
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:55,554
was put into use
by the State of New York

14
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:57,823
and it was hailed
as the most humane means

15
00:00:57,824 --> 00:00:59,825
of putting someone to death.

16
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:02,828
Or as electrocution,
the condemned individual

17
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:05,331
is simply made a part
of the circuit.

18
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:09,835
Now who will be a witness

19
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:10,736
for my lord

20
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,104
yes, who will be a witness

21
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:13,105
for my lord

22
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:14,606
now who will be a witness

23
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:18,110
for my lord

24
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:22,114
who will be a witness

25
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:29,622
for my lord

26
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:03,722
give peace a chance

27
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:07,626
all we are saying

28
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:10,996
is give peace a chance

29
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:13,899
No more war!
No more war!

30
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,169
No more war!
No more war!

31
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:21,173
No more war!
No more war!

32
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:25,077
No more war!
No more war!

33
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:35,521
Get out of here!

34
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:48,100
Look at this.

35
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:50,335
How horrible.

36
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,837
Can you believe it?

37
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:54,840
And what they aim for
is your crotch.

38
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,375
Forget want
to think about the police today.

39
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:58,877
We want
to have a nice holiday dinner.

40
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:00,379
The turkey is cooling.

41
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,880
And Robert,
you will mentally prepare yourself

42
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:04,383
to carve in just a few moments.

43
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:07,386
So, to get back
to the subject...

44
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:08,887
A foundation.

45
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:11,890
Right.
The Paul and Rochelle Isaacson foundation

46
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:13,392
for revolutionary studies.

47
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:15,894
Did you know
anything about this?

48
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:18,897
Well, uh... Your sister's
been thinking about it,

49
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:19,898
and...

50
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:21,400
Oh.

51
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:24,403
She has been talking
to some people here

52
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:25,904
and in New York.

53
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:28,907
She asked me if it's
technically feasible,

54
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:30,909
which it is.
This is the year

55
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:33,912
you come into equal
possession of the trust.

56
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:36,248
The way Ascher set it up,
there are no conditions.

57
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:38,550
It's our legacy, Daniel.

58
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:41,053
What the movement
needs is money.

59
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:44,056
We can do
great things together.

60
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,058
Well, I mean, suppose...

61
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:49,494
You know,
I happen to feel that demonstrating

62
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:52,331
and getting busted
is not the way to do great things.

63
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,101
All right. That's fair.

64
00:03:56,102 --> 00:04:00,138
Resistance is
just one thing, one alternative.

65
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:03,141
But there are
other things going on

66
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:04,610
everywhere.

67
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:08,113
I'm going through changes
every day of my life.

68
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:09,982
So is everyone.

69
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:11,484
The proper stance...

70
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:16,488
I believe, is not to
criticize from the outside,

71
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:19,124
but to get inside
and help create.

72
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:23,128
Susan, how is it
whenever you present me with an idea,

73
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:25,631
you know, or ask me
to do something,

74
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:29,102
it's in... it's in
a way calculated to turn me off?

75
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,604
Maybe because not much is
required to turn you off.

76
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,040
Let's try to keep
the discussion

77
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,541
at a reasonably high plane.

78
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:38,043
I try to, Robert.

79
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:40,412
But anything that comes from me
is automatically suspect,

80
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:41,713
right, Daniel?

81
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:43,215
No, no. No.

82
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:44,216
It's just that I hear about it

83
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:45,884
almost as a privilege,

84
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:48,387
you know, after
the decisions have been made.

85
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:49,889
Forget it, Daniel, ok?

86
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:54,394
Forget I said a thing.

87
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:58,830
This really
makes me sad. It really does.

88
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:01,833
Here we are in this
horrible imperialist war,

89
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:04,336
we're burning people
in Vietnam,

90
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:07,839
and the issue is
how I happen to talk.

91
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,341
No, I'll tell you
what the issue is,

92
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:11,343
the issue is if you want
to give away your money,

93
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:12,344
why not just do it?
I mean,

94
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:14,346
what do you got
to put the family tag on it for?

95
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:16,381
What do you have
to advertise for?

96
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:17,883
Because the name Isaacson
has meaning.

97
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:21,353
It's important.
What happened to the Isaacsons is history.

98
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:22,854
Do you hear that?
She fucking calls

99
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:24,189
her own
mother and father the Isaacsons.

100
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,091
Look, you two,
if you can't conduct a civil discussion...

101
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:27,592
I'm not ashamed of my name.

102
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:30,095
I'm proud of who I am...

103
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:31,330
Unlike you.

104
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,333
You should see the schmucky
way you come on in this world.

105
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,834
Well, that may be.

106
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,836
But I don't think a foundation

107
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,338
is necessarily a good idea

108
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,341
just 'cause it has
the name Isaacson.

109
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:45,344
How's it going to
work? Who's it for?

110
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,345
What'll it do?

111
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,847
Well, why not just let it...

112
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,849
Happen?
Give it a chance!

113
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,852
You cop out
with this phony cynicism.

114
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,254
Maybe you have a better idea what
to do with that blood money.

115
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:58,290
That blood money
earned you a college education,

116
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,791
straightened your teeth.

117
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:02,694
Why can't you just admit
that you're a selfish prick?

118
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:05,130
I don't want the bread.

119
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:06,531
I mean, I thought...

120
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,533
I thought
we'd give it to the Lewins.

121
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:09,534
No. As guardian,

122
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:12,037
that's the one alternative
that I can't permit.

123
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,038
Yeah? Well,
you ought to reconsider.

124
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,541
You're just due
for all the bullshit

125
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,610
you put up with
the last dozen years.

126
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:20,612
Don't worry, Daniel.

127
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:22,614
You can forget
about the foundation.

128
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:24,616
It doesn't need you.

129
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:26,118
Go back to your life.

130
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:28,954
Take this milk cow
with you and go back home.

131
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:31,656
If this doesn't stop
right now, I'm not serving.

132
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:33,725
Go back to the stacks, Daniel.

133
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,227
The world needs
another graduate student.

134
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,329
I don't have to go
out and get clubbed

135
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,331
to... to justify
my existence!

136
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,299
No, you'd rather jerk off
behind a book!

137
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,601
Stop it, you two!

138
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:44,102
Susan, you're
not handling this very well.

139
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:45,604
Yes, she is!
She is, she is!

140
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:47,105
She's a revolutionary!

141
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:48,106
She's been to the barricades!

142
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:50,475
She's got all the answers!

143
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:51,977
Once it was sex.

144
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:53,779
Sex was going to do
it for you, right?

145
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,281
Then it was acid.
Acid was going to do it for you.

146
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:57,783
Remember that,
susie? Huh? Huh?

147
00:06:57,784 --> 00:06:58,917
And before that, it was God.

148
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,953
You knew all about God!

149
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:03,455
And now it's revolution!

150
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:04,856
The revolution!

151
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:07,359
I thought we did
that! I thought we'd been through that!

152
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,527
Susan.

153
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:10,028
I don't believe it.

154
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:12,030
Ah!

155
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:14,033
I don't believe you.

156
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:17,035
You really think...

157
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:18,437
he thinks they were guilty.

158
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:22,774
That's why he's like this.
Can't you see?

159
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:25,610
I mean, what did they die
for? This piece of shit.

160
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,012
Susan, please.

161
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:31,049
My mother and father
were murdered!

162
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,552
Why do you let him
sit here and do it again?

163
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:46,498
Wages up, hours down!
Make New York a union town!

Wages up, hours down!
Make New York a union town!

174
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:34,513
Wages up, hours down!
Make New York a union town!

175
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,714
Cossack!

176
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:37,215
Capitalist goons!

177
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:38,783
Cossack!

178
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:39,784
Look out!

179
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:40,786
Cossack!

180
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:43,289
Cossack!

181
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:02,874
You go to city?

182
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,376
At night.

183
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,378
Me, too.

184
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,380
The fascists
are taking Europe, the world is dying,

185
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,881
and you're playing
trotsky as politics!

186
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,884
There would be no Hitler
today if not for Stalin.

187
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,386
True or not?
That is simplistic!

188
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,887
Where was Stalin
when united front and Germany

189
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,389
could
have kept Hitler was seizing power?

190
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,890
Now you're all
big anti-fascists.

191
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,892
We're prepared
to grant you your righteousness. What then?

192
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,394
Remember how you
broke up our meeting?

193
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,896
Your people threw
chairs. I remember.

194
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,398
Yesterday we were social fascists.
Today, we're your comrades.

195
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,899
You're a simplistic sectarian.

196
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,401
No, I'm not.
I'm Jewish.

197
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,902
Then maybe you'll
explain to the Jews

198
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:31,903
in Nazi concentration camps

199
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:32,904
the fine points
of your dialectic!

200
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:33,905
What about Spain?

201
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,274
What about
the trotskyists in Spain?

202
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,079
I have to get home.

203
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,581
I'll see you home.

204
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,083
Don't be foolish.
All the way to the Bronx?

205
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,085
First you have to
ride downtown.

206
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,587
So what?

207
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,589
I can't invite you in.
My mother.

208
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,591
I'll picket your mother.

209
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:58,997
"And this possibility
now exists.

210
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:02,500
"The seizure of the means
of production by society

211
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:04,502
"puts an end
to commodity production

212
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:06,004
"and therewith
to the domination

213
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:08,006
"of the produce
over the producer.

214
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:10,508
"To carry through this
world-emancipating act

215
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:13,445
"is the historical mission
of the modern proletariat,

216
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:16,448
"and it is the task
of scientific socialism

217
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,450
"to bring to the consciousness
of the now oppressed class

218
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,952
"the conditions and
the nature of the act

219
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:24,456
which it is its destiny
to accomplish."

220
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:31,162
I had a meeting.

221
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:33,164
A meeting.

222
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:34,666
With a boy?

223
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:38,170
He's not my boy.

224
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:45,677
Mama, would you like me
to ask him to dinner? Even tomorrow.

225
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:48,681
And the three of us
can spend an evening.

226
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:09,701
50 cents for my carfare,
$2.00 for my allowance.

227
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:11,203
No.

228
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:16,708
I gave $3.00
to the Scottsboro boys.

229
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:18,711
The Scottsboro boys?

230
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:23,215
Mama, we're trying to keep
them from being lynched!

231
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:30,221
As God protected papa
from the sweatshops.

232
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:31,723
Oy.

233
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:33,225
Oy.

234
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:44,969
We shall not be moved

235
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,971
prouder is our leader

236
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:48,473
we shall not be moved

237
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:49,474
just like a tree

238
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:52,977
that's standing by the water

239
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:55,980
we shall not be moved

240
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:56,981
Louder!

241
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:58,983
Prouder is our leader

242
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:00,985
we shall not be moved

243
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:02,987
prouder is our leader

244
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:04,489
we shall not be moved

245
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,990
just like a tree

246
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:08,993
that's standing by the water

247
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:13,131
we shall not be moved...

248
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:21,106
And those who excuse
the infamous Munich betrayal

249
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:22,107
are loudest
in their condemnation

250
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:24,909
of the nonaggression pact.
And why?

251
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,912
Because by forcing Germany
to sign this pact,

252
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,914
with one stroke of the pen,

253
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:32,951
the Soviet union
overturns the design

254
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:34,452
of Western imperialists.

255
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:37,756
Hitler's warrings are
contained in the East,

256
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,257
and mankind is diverted

257
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:43,628
from the abyss
of darkness and destruction.

258
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:48,099
The Soviet union is
the only socialist nation in the world,

259
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,301
and she has done something
for the world

260
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:53,304
which the world
will someday understand,

261
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:55,307
if it doesn't already.

262
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:02,046
Fantastic, comrade.
Fantastic!

263
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:03,815
Great honor!

264
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:05,817
A great honor!
Thank you, sir.

265
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:07,819
I'm Dr. Selig Mindish,
the camp dentist.

266
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,320
This is my wife sadie.

267
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:10,822
A pleasure to meet you.

268
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:12,323
Sadie. And my little
girl Linda.

269
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:13,324
Oh, you were wonderful.
You were just wonderful.

270
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:14,325
Hello, Linda.

271
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:15,827
Wait, wait, wait.

272
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:17,328
Paul! Paul! Paul!

273
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:18,830
Right here! Right here!

274
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:20,832
Comrade Bernheim?
Yes?

275
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:21,833
Paul Isaacson.

276
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:22,834
Hello, Paul.

277
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:23,835
He's brilliant, brilliant.

278
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:24,836
Nice to meet you.

279
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:25,837
Rochelle.

280
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:26,838
A gold and a cup.

281
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:28,840
This is my friend Rochelle.

282
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:31,343
Hello, Rochelle.
Nice to make your acquaintance.

283
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,498
I got to hand it to him.

284
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,501
Imagine making
a radio technician of Paul Isaacson.

285
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,002
Well, you know something?
I do it well.

286
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:01,506
I was first in my training.
I understand the army.

287
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:04,008
I get along with the men.

288
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,510
In basic, I pulled my weight.

289
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,512
I was determined
those crackers would not have the occasion

290
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,513
to laugh at a Jew
from New York.

291
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:11,516
I ran with the heavy pack,
I climbed ropes,

292
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,518
I crawled under machine gunfire
with real bullets.

293
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,855
I did the push-ups,
and they came to respect me.

294
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,356
And at night,
in our bull sessions,

295
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,459
I told them our beliefs,
and they listened.

296
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,461
And you know...

297
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:27,465
Those Georgia crackers
living down there in the red Clay,

298
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:30,468
they taught me a few things...

299
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:33,471
the dignity of ordinary men...

300
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:36,474
And the unsung heroism
of men who work the earth

301
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:37,976
with their hands,

302
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:41,980
and the good common sense
of the masses

303
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:45,483
who have not had an education.

304
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:47,485
And now, Paul.

305
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:48,486
What now?

306
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:50,488
Ah, who knows?

307
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:52,490
I don't have my orders yet.

308
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:54,993
God forbid you should
end up overseas.

309
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:56,495
Why "God forbid"?

310
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:00,098
Should we let the Soviet union

311
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:02,101
fight our battles for us?

312
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:10,108
I'd be proud to be a part
of the second front,

313
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:12,610
to meet our gallant
Soviet allies

314
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:15,113
and to link arms with them.

315
00:16:22,366 --> 00:16:23,867
She was depressed,

316
00:16:23,868 --> 00:16:26,370
but that was nothing new.

317
00:16:27,371 --> 00:16:29,873
We wanted her
to come home for the weekend.

318
00:16:29,874 --> 00:16:32,375
She said she had plans.

319
00:16:32,376 --> 00:16:34,878
I didn't realize.

320
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,881
She was making her classes,

321
00:16:37,882 --> 00:16:39,382
she was doing her work.

322
00:16:39,383 --> 00:16:40,383
Well, it's the politics.

323
00:16:40,384 --> 00:16:43,887
Last winter when Susan
terminated therapy,

324
00:16:43,888 --> 00:16:46,389
I warned her not
to get too involved.

325
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:47,390
All that radial stuff.

326
00:16:47,391 --> 00:16:48,892
Who gets a strawberry
ice cream soda?

327
00:16:48,893 --> 00:16:49,894
Here.

328
00:16:51,395 --> 00:16:53,396
But of course she did.

329
00:16:53,397 --> 00:16:56,900
SDS, resistance.
Who knows what?

330
00:16:56,901 --> 00:17:00,070
In this family,
descent is traumatic.

331
00:17:00,071 --> 00:17:01,071
It's understandable.

332
00:17:01,072 --> 00:17:03,807
She bit off more
than she could chew.

333
00:17:03,808 --> 00:17:04,808
Susan's a willful person.

334
00:17:04,809 --> 00:17:06,810
I have great faith in her.

335
00:17:06,811 --> 00:17:09,813
If you're not
finishing that, pass it over here.

336
00:17:09,814 --> 00:17:11,815
Of course, I would be
insulting your intelligence

337
00:17:11,816 --> 00:17:14,317
if I didn't admit
that this is a pretty serious business.

338
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:17,320
She's been down before
but this is the worst.

339
00:17:17,321 --> 00:17:20,123
What'd you do,
put ketchup on this?

340
00:17:20,124 --> 00:17:21,191
What?

341
00:17:21,192 --> 00:17:23,693
You... you put ketchup
on a club sandwich.

342
00:17:23,694 --> 00:17:25,095
Why not ketchup?

343
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:28,431
On the other hand,

344
00:17:28,432 --> 00:17:31,434
she's got tremendous resources.

345
00:17:31,435 --> 00:17:33,436
We'll get her all settled
and then we can go to work.

346
00:17:33,437 --> 00:17:36,439
You don't put ketchup on
a club sandwich. Yuck.

347
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,641
Yuck!

348
00:17:41,846 --> 00:17:45,315
Would you like something else?
How about ordering something?

349
00:17:45,316 --> 00:17:46,316
No, thanks, dad.

350
00:17:46,317 --> 00:17:47,317
I'd still have to sit here

351
00:17:47,318 --> 00:17:50,620
and listen to this schmuck
doctor talk about my sister.

352
00:17:50,621 --> 00:17:55,158
Daniel, I hope that you are prepared
to apologize to Dr. Duberstein.

353
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:57,160
What is it about Susan and me

354
00:17:57,161 --> 00:17:58,662
that makes anyone
feel privileged

355
00:17:58,663 --> 00:18:00,664
to say anything at all to us?

356
00:18:00,665 --> 00:18:03,033
Who is this creep?
Who needs him?

357
00:18:03,034 --> 00:18:05,535
I called Dr. Duberstein
because I think we need him.

358
00:18:05,536 --> 00:18:07,537
Very badly.

359
00:18:07,538 --> 00:18:10,173
I think Susan needs him and I don't
think you're handling yourself well.

360
00:18:10,174 --> 00:18:13,176
She stopped going
to him because he was no fucking good.

361
00:18:13,177 --> 00:18:15,178
Now he can't even get
her out of there.

362
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:17,681
Can't get her out
of a public asylum for wards of the State.

363
00:18:17,682 --> 00:18:19,716
Bums they pick up
off the street.

364
00:18:19,717 --> 00:18:21,217
One more night
in what happens to be

365
00:18:21,218 --> 00:18:24,387
one of the best hospitals in the
east is not going to hurt her.

366
00:18:24,388 --> 00:18:26,590
The situation's under control.

367
00:19:14,038 --> 00:19:15,538
We are a little late.

368
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:18,041
I can tell from here
a tremendous crowd.

369
00:19:18,042 --> 00:19:21,044
You should feel proud.
Do you hear it?

370
00:19:21,045 --> 00:19:22,545
Now, when you get up there,

371
00:19:22,546 --> 00:19:24,547
keep your hands up,
stand straight,

372
00:19:24,548 --> 00:19:28,051
don't slump, so that
everyone can see you.

373
00:19:28,052 --> 00:19:29,552
Understand?

374
00:19:29,553 --> 00:19:31,554
I have something in my eye.

375
00:19:31,555 --> 00:19:33,056
We have no time,
Susan. Come.

376
00:19:33,057 --> 00:19:35,558
Just a minute,
Mr. Ascher.

377
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:37,560
Please, Daniel, we are late.

378
00:19:37,561 --> 00:19:39,563
This is very important.

379
00:19:41,065 --> 00:19:43,733
Hurry! Hurry!

380
00:19:43,734 --> 00:19:46,736
I ask you, is this our
so-called American justice?

381
00:19:46,737 --> 00:19:50,340
Is this an example to the world
of American fair play?

382
00:19:50,341 --> 00:19:52,842
Can anyone believe this
heroic young couple,

383
00:19:52,843 --> 00:19:57,247
torn from their homes, separated
from their precious children

384
00:19:57,248 --> 00:19:59,749
are being persecuted
for anything more

385
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,752
than their proudly held
left-wing views?

386
00:20:02,753 --> 00:20:06,189
For believing... for believing
in the dignity of man

387
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:09,193
and the right of each
and every individual to the...

388
00:20:10,694 --> 00:20:12,195
These are the children.

389
00:20:12,196 --> 00:20:14,197
These are the children.
Let us through, please.

390
00:20:14,198 --> 00:20:15,632
I got their
children. Please.

391
00:20:15,633 --> 00:20:18,635
The trial of Paul
and Rochelle Isaacson.

392
00:20:18,636 --> 00:20:20,136
All the world
looks on with horror

393
00:20:20,137 --> 00:20:23,206
at this blatant
persecution of people...

394
00:20:23,207 --> 00:20:26,209
The platform. Please.
Get the children up there.

395
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:27,210
The children.

396
00:20:27,211 --> 00:20:28,211
Daniel!

397
00:20:28,212 --> 00:20:29,312
Careful. The children.

398
00:20:29,313 --> 00:20:30,313
Let them by.

399
00:20:30,314 --> 00:20:32,482
Susan! Susan!

400
00:20:32,483 --> 00:20:34,484
The children.

401
00:20:34,485 --> 00:20:35,486
Here are the children!

402
00:20:37,688 --> 00:20:39,189
Be careful, be careful.

403
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,958
Daniel!

404
00:20:44,829 --> 00:20:46,329
Free them! Free them!

405
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:49,332
Free them! Free them!

406
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:50,834
Free them! Free them!

407
00:20:50,835 --> 00:20:52,469
Free them! Free them!

408
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:54,471
Free them! Free them!

409
00:20:54,472 --> 00:20:56,973
Free them! Free them!

410
00:20:56,974 --> 00:20:58,475
Free them! Free them!

411
00:20:58,476 --> 00:20:59,976
Free them! Free them!

412
00:20:59,977 --> 00:21:01,478
Free them! Free them!

413
00:21:01,479 --> 00:21:03,413
Free them! Free them!

414
00:21:03,414 --> 00:21:04,914
Free them! Free them!

415
00:21:04,915 --> 00:21:06,316
Free them! Free them!

416
00:21:06,317 --> 00:21:07,151
Here are the children!

417
00:21:11,555 --> 00:21:13,556
Free them! Free them!

418
00:21:13,557 --> 00:21:15,558
Free them! Free them!

419
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:17,560
Free them! Free them!

420
00:21:17,561 --> 00:21:19,229
Free them! Free them!

421
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,897
Free them! Free them!

422
00:21:20,898 --> 00:21:22,899
Free them! Free them!

423
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,400
Free them! Free them!

424
00:21:24,401 --> 00:21:26,736
Free them! Free them!

425
00:21:26,737 --> 00:21:28,605
Free them! Free them!

426
00:21:28,606 --> 00:21:29,906
Free them! Free them!

427
00:21:29,907 --> 00:21:32,208
Free them! Free them!

428
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:33,710
Free them! Free them!

429
00:21:33,711 --> 00:21:35,211
Free them! Free them!

430
00:21:35,212 --> 00:21:37,347
Free them! Free them!

431
00:21:37,348 --> 00:21:38,849
Free them.

432
00:21:41,352 --> 00:21:42,853
Are you ok?

433
00:21:46,357 --> 00:21:48,358
She was on her way to New York.

434
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:49,860
Perhaps to see you.

435
00:21:52,363 --> 00:21:54,864
I don't think so.

436
00:21:54,865 --> 00:21:56,366
Dan, I see no reason

437
00:21:56,367 --> 00:21:58,368
why you shouldn't
hold onto the car...

438
00:21:58,369 --> 00:21:59,870
Till she gets better.

439
00:22:02,873 --> 00:22:05,375
We should have
spent more time...

440
00:22:07,378 --> 00:22:09,879
We should've never
stopped talking.

441
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,383
She's a separate
person, Daniel.

442
00:22:13,384 --> 00:22:15,885
You lead separate lives.

443
00:22:15,886 --> 00:22:17,387
You know, maybe when
she gets better,

444
00:22:17,388 --> 00:22:18,888
Susan can come stay with us.

445
00:22:18,889 --> 00:22:20,890
I really want her to.

446
00:22:20,891 --> 00:22:23,893
We would love her
and the baby would love her.

447
00:22:23,894 --> 00:22:25,395
Daniel, this is an illness,

448
00:22:25,396 --> 00:22:27,398
and like any other illness,
it'll be treated.

449
00:22:35,673 --> 00:22:38,174
Well, what if she's...

450
00:22:38,175 --> 00:22:39,676
Not ill?

451
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:43,180
I mean, what if she's...

452
00:22:47,184 --> 00:22:49,186
Inconsolable?

453
00:22:51,689 --> 00:22:53,690
Buy everything mommy
asked for, Daniel?

454
00:22:53,691 --> 00:22:55,191
Yes.

455
00:22:55,192 --> 00:22:56,192
See you got your
favorite cereal.

456
00:22:56,193 --> 00:22:57,193
Who's on the back?

457
00:22:57,194 --> 00:22:58,695
Joe DiMaggio.

458
00:22:58,696 --> 00:23:01,698
Why you suppose
they put his picture on a box of cereal?

459
00:23:01,699 --> 00:23:02,699
'Cause he's strong.

460
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,201
That's right.
And although it doesn't say so

461
00:23:05,202 --> 00:23:07,470
in so many words,
it puts an idea in your mind...

462
00:23:07,471 --> 00:23:08,972
that if you eat this cereal,

463
00:23:08,973 --> 00:23:10,974
you'll be strong like he is.

464
00:23:10,975 --> 00:23:12,475
Yet if you look
at the nourishment

465
00:23:12,476 --> 00:23:13,810
this cereal contains,

466
00:23:13,811 --> 00:23:16,813
you'd see
you'd do better with ordinary oatmeal.

467
00:23:16,814 --> 00:23:18,314
Oatmeal has lumps.

468
00:23:18,315 --> 00:23:19,616
So they're lying,

469
00:23:19,617 --> 00:23:22,619
and that is what
advertising is...

470
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,621
lying.

471
00:23:25,122 --> 00:23:29,626
Now, uh... Of course
not Joe DiMaggio,

472
00:23:29,627 --> 00:23:31,127
but one or another

473
00:23:31,128 --> 00:23:33,129
of your baseball heroes,

474
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:36,199
he sells his name
and his picture

475
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,701
to the cereal
company for money,

476
00:23:38,702 --> 00:23:40,703
saying he eats their cereal

477
00:23:40,704 --> 00:23:44,207
when in fact
he probably drinks beer

478
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:45,708
and he smokes cigarettes.

479
00:23:45,709 --> 00:23:47,410
Yeah, it's funny.

480
00:23:47,411 --> 00:23:50,413
But what is
he but a worker like anyone

481
00:23:50,414 --> 00:23:53,416
who earns his bread
by his labor?

482
00:23:53,417 --> 00:23:55,918
And the fact
that he plays a game called baseball,

483
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,920
that makes no difference.

484
00:23:57,921 --> 00:23:59,922
He is no better than the man

485
00:23:59,923 --> 00:24:00,923
who works in a factory.

486
00:24:00,924 --> 00:24:02,158
Do you know why?

487
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,394
Because he doesn't
own the team.

488
00:24:04,395 --> 00:24:06,896
That's right.

489
00:24:06,897 --> 00:24:08,698
You're very smart.

490
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,768
But at least he plays.

491
00:24:11,769 --> 00:24:15,271
And there are negro
baseball players,

492
00:24:15,272 --> 00:24:16,773
marvelous athletes

493
00:24:16,774 --> 00:24:19,008
who are not allowed to play

494
00:24:19,009 --> 00:24:21,010
because of?

495
00:24:21,011 --> 00:24:23,179
Because of Jim crow.

496
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,681
Right.

497
00:24:24,682 --> 00:24:27,684
No matter how good they are.

498
00:24:27,685 --> 00:24:29,185
Truman announced today...

499
00:24:29,186 --> 00:24:30,587
it's working.

500
00:24:32,589 --> 00:24:34,090
Hi, grandma.

501
00:24:57,281 --> 00:24:59,082
Susan.

502
00:24:59,083 --> 00:25:01,084
The smell is terrible.

503
00:25:01,085 --> 00:25:02,418
Can you open the window?

504
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:04,220
All the windows are open.

505
00:25:04,221 --> 00:25:05,722
Maybe if the driving
were smoother,

506
00:25:05,723 --> 00:25:07,724
the children would
not get carsick.

507
00:25:07,725 --> 00:25:09,525
Everyone had
the same idea today.

508
00:25:09,526 --> 00:25:12,729
I find no fault in the driving.

509
00:25:22,139 --> 00:25:23,740
Paul, that's nonsense.

510
00:25:23,741 --> 00:25:25,742
Foster and Dennis are in jail.

511
00:25:25,743 --> 00:25:26,743
The party is a shambles.

512
00:25:26,744 --> 00:25:27,744
Under Browder...
Browder?

513
00:25:27,745 --> 00:25:29,746
All right, all right.
But under Browder,

514
00:25:29,747 --> 00:25:31,748
the party was at least
connected to something.

515
00:25:31,749 --> 00:25:33,750
Now we're alone.

516
00:25:33,751 --> 00:25:34,751
And what they're
not destroying,

517
00:25:34,752 --> 00:25:36,252
we're destroying ourselves.

518
00:25:36,253 --> 00:25:38,254
Sometimes I wonder
what's happened to our lives.

519
00:25:38,255 --> 00:25:42,258
I find it hard
to remember what we've accomplished.

520
00:25:42,259 --> 00:25:45,762
So, things are bad
at the moment.

521
00:25:45,763 --> 00:25:47,263
They're very bad.

522
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:48,765
The party's had some effect,

523
00:25:48,766 --> 00:25:50,767
or there would be
no reaction, huh?

524
00:25:50,768 --> 00:25:53,770
What have we done
for the working class?

525
00:25:53,771 --> 00:25:56,774
Is it nothing?
And the negroes?

526
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:10,119
You having a good time?

527
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,121
Yep.
Heat and the traffic,

528
00:26:12,122 --> 00:26:13,122
they don't matter now, do they?

529
00:26:13,123 --> 00:26:14,123
Nope.

530
00:26:14,124 --> 00:26:15,625
Ocean's beautiful, huh?
Uh-huh.

531
00:26:15,626 --> 00:26:16,626
So you see?

532
00:26:16,627 --> 00:26:18,628
Some things are worth
the effort, huh?

533
00:26:18,629 --> 00:26:20,129
Yeah!

534
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:21,831
Ha ha ha ha!

535
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:29,172
Sadie, how are ya?

536
00:26:33,644 --> 00:26:35,112
Daniel's a good boy.

537
00:26:38,148 --> 00:26:40,150
This is for a good boy.

538
00:26:41,151 --> 00:26:43,119
Daniel is a good boy.

539
00:26:54,598 --> 00:26:56,098
Can't I go?

540
00:26:56,099 --> 00:26:57,099
It's time to go!

541
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:59,602
I'm ready.
The sandwiches are in the icebox.

542
00:26:59,603 --> 00:27:01,103
Can't I go?

543
00:27:01,104 --> 00:27:02,104
Your father's in charge.

544
00:27:02,105 --> 00:27:04,607
Please, Rochelle,
don't start that.

545
00:27:04,608 --> 00:27:05,608
If there was the slightest
chance of trouble,

546
00:27:05,609 --> 00:27:07,610
do you think I'd let you go,
let alone the boy go?

547
00:27:07,611 --> 00:27:08,611
Be sensible.

548
00:27:08,612 --> 00:27:10,112
Don't talk to me
of being sensible.

549
00:27:10,113 --> 00:27:11,614
There's a court order,
for God's sake. What could happen?

550
00:27:11,615 --> 00:27:13,115
Well, what's the problem?

551
00:27:13,116 --> 00:27:14,116
No problem.

552
00:27:14,117 --> 00:27:15,618
We're having a meeting
in the bathroom.

553
00:27:15,619 --> 00:27:18,120
We're deciding
whether to take Daniel.

554
00:27:18,121 --> 00:27:20,122
My Linda's coming. Why not?

555
00:27:20,123 --> 00:27:22,124
Lots of children are going.

556
00:27:22,125 --> 00:27:24,126
Is the little prince
afraid to go?

557
00:27:24,127 --> 00:27:25,127
Don't you want your son

558
00:27:25,128 --> 00:27:27,129
to hear one of
the great voices of our time?

559
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:29,131
Is it such a terrible
crime if he can see Robeson,

560
00:27:29,132 --> 00:27:33,135
the great people's artist?

561
00:27:33,136 --> 00:27:34,637
Danny, go get your blue jacket,

562
00:27:34,638 --> 00:27:36,639
and tie your shoelaces
and pull up your socks,

563
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,642
and then when you get
back, I want you to go to the bathroom

564
00:27:39,643 --> 00:27:41,144
even if you don't have to.

565
00:27:45,249 --> 00:27:47,751
Come on.
It's about time.

566
00:28:03,934 --> 00:28:06,936
Grandma's running away again.

567
00:28:06,937 --> 00:28:09,438
I see. Don't worry.

568
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:11,941
Why is grandma crazy?

569
00:28:11,942 --> 00:28:14,277
She can't stand
the torment of her life.

570
00:28:14,278 --> 00:28:19,282
Far and wide
as the eye can wander

571
00:28:19,283 --> 00:28:23,786
heathen folk are everywhere

572
00:28:23,787 --> 00:28:28,791
not a bird sings out
to cheer us

573
00:28:28,792 --> 00:28:34,463
folks are standing
gaunt and bare

574
00:28:34,464 --> 00:28:38,968
we are the people's soldiers

575
00:28:38,969 --> 00:28:43,172
we're marching
with our strengths

576
00:28:43,173 --> 00:28:46,876
to beyond

577
00:29:45,889 --> 00:29:48,091
Hi.

578
00:29:56,099 --> 00:29:57,600
How's your wife?

579
00:29:58,602 --> 00:30:00,103
Fine.

580
00:30:02,606 --> 00:30:04,607
Your baby?

581
00:30:04,608 --> 00:30:06,108
He's fine, too.

582
00:30:06,109 --> 00:30:08,611
He's fine.

583
00:30:08,612 --> 00:30:10,112
He came along.

584
00:30:10,113 --> 00:30:11,614
He's downstairs.

585
00:30:13,116 --> 00:30:15,618
It's serious.

586
00:30:15,619 --> 00:30:19,622
Mmm, no.
I don't think it's...

587
00:30:19,623 --> 00:30:22,125
I don't think it's so serious.

588
00:30:24,127 --> 00:30:26,128
But the Lewins, too.

589
00:30:26,129 --> 00:30:30,633
Uh, yeah,
their car just... just pulled in.

590
00:30:33,136 --> 00:30:35,638
That's pretty serious...

591
00:30:37,641 --> 00:30:40,643
When my whole family's here.

592
00:30:40,644 --> 00:30:43,646
How su-supportive...

593
00:30:43,647 --> 00:30:45,648
Of miss.

594
00:30:45,649 --> 00:30:47,650
What?

595
00:30:47,651 --> 00:30:52,656
Good God, am I going
to have to see them?

596
00:30:54,658 --> 00:30:56,659
And I like ira, believe me.

597
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,661
I got to believe that gnome.

598
00:30:58,662 --> 00:31:00,162
No matter how bad it gets,

599
00:31:00,163 --> 00:31:04,667
you and I can never
bring him down totally.

600
00:31:04,668 --> 00:31:08,671
And that's
his saving grace, isn't it?

601
00:31:08,672 --> 00:31:11,173
The right to do
irreparable harm

602
00:31:11,174 --> 00:31:12,675
is a blood right.

603
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,114
Oh.

604
00:31:24,621 --> 00:31:26,622
It's...

605
00:31:26,623 --> 00:31:29,626
It's just that I...

606
00:31:31,628 --> 00:31:33,129
I'm...

607
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:36,632
I'm so overcome with it.

608
00:31:39,135 --> 00:31:41,637
Overcome with
the calamity of it.

609
00:31:41,638 --> 00:31:42,638
Hey, it's ok.

610
00:31:42,639 --> 00:31:43,640
Hey.

611
00:31:45,041 --> 00:31:48,544
And I feel like, uh...

612
00:31:48,545 --> 00:31:52,047
And I feel like, uh,
something's been, uh...

613
00:31:52,048 --> 00:31:54,049
Torn...

614
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:55,918
Torn...

615
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,987
I forget what...

616
00:31:58,988 --> 00:32:01,990
What it is you're
supposed to expect

617
00:32:01,991 --> 00:32:03,892
from being alive.

618
00:32:05,729 --> 00:32:07,229
It's ok.

619
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:08,664
It's ok.

620
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:15,572
Glad you came.

621
00:32:18,074 --> 00:32:19,575
Daniel.

622
00:32:22,579 --> 00:32:26,081
You know,
I had something to tell you.

623
00:32:26,082 --> 00:32:30,586
I can't remember what it was.

624
00:32:30,587 --> 00:32:32,589
I can't.

625
00:32:48,605 --> 00:32:53,109
They're still
fucking us, Daniel.

626
00:32:55,111 --> 00:32:57,613
You get the picture?

627
00:33:04,387 --> 00:33:06,889
Drawing and quartering
was a form of execution

628
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:09,391
favored by the English kings,

629
00:33:09,392 --> 00:33:10,893
except if he was an aristocrat,

630
00:33:10,894 --> 00:33:12,394
in which case,
he was simply beheaded.

631
00:33:12,395 --> 00:33:14,897
The offender was hanged
and cut down

632
00:33:14,898 --> 00:33:17,399
before he was dead.

633
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:23,439
Then he was emasculated,
disemboweled.

634
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,509
And his entrails were set on
fire in front of his eyes.

635
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:30,012
This ritual was completed
with a hacking

636
00:33:30,013 --> 00:33:32,514
of the body into four parts.

637
00:33:32,515 --> 00:33:34,483
The quarters being
thrown to the dogs.

638
00:33:36,653 --> 00:33:38,654
Where did you get that?

639
00:33:38,655 --> 00:33:39,655
It was on order.

640
00:33:39,656 --> 00:33:41,156
Can I take it home?

641
00:33:41,157 --> 00:33:44,159
Just a minute,
Danny. Come here.

642
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,028
Radio.

643
00:33:51,034 --> 00:33:53,035
Mindish has been arrested.

644
00:33:53,036 --> 00:33:54,536
What?

645
00:33:54,537 --> 00:33:55,538
Keep your voice down.

646
00:33:58,041 --> 00:34:01,043
Early this morning,
while I was eating breakfast,

647
00:34:01,044 --> 00:34:03,045
the FBI comes,
takes him downtown.

648
00:34:03,046 --> 00:34:04,546
Oh, my God.

649
00:34:04,547 --> 00:34:07,549
Well... Don't say
anything to anyone.

650
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:09,551
You just, um...

651
00:34:09,552 --> 00:34:12,054
Go about your business

652
00:34:12,055 --> 00:34:14,056
and let everything
remain the same.

653
00:34:14,057 --> 00:34:15,057
I get upstairs, we'll talk.

654
00:34:15,058 --> 00:34:17,059
How do you know this?

655
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,560
Sadie Mindish told me. I don't
understand the brains of some people.

656
00:34:18,561 --> 00:34:19,561
She says Selig wanted me.

657
00:34:19,562 --> 00:34:21,063
No, he tells her to call me.

658
00:34:21,064 --> 00:34:22,064
Ohh.

659
00:34:22,065 --> 00:34:23,065
What did he do?
You got to keep count.

660
00:34:23,066 --> 00:34:24,366
Where
is Dr. Mindish?

661
00:34:24,367 --> 00:34:25,367
They're insane.

662
00:34:25,368 --> 00:34:27,369
They think he's done
something wrong.

663
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:30,372
Ah! That's my honey!
Huh? Ahh!

664
00:34:30,373 --> 00:34:32,374
How's my little girl?

665
00:34:32,375 --> 00:34:33,375
If they didn't arrest people,

666
00:34:33,376 --> 00:34:34,877
they'd have nothing to do.

667
00:34:34,878 --> 00:34:35,878
Do me a favor, Rochelle.

668
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:36,879
Take the groceries upstairs.

669
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,380
I'll be home at the usual time.

670
00:34:38,381 --> 00:34:39,882
It's only
the coming of fascism.

671
00:34:39,883 --> 00:34:41,884
Why should
we be surprised, huh?

672
00:34:41,885 --> 00:34:43,318
I'm glad they arrested him.

673
00:34:43,319 --> 00:34:44,686
Danny!

674
00:34:44,687 --> 00:34:47,189
He likes to hurt you.

675
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,724
He says stupid things.

676
00:34:52,695 --> 00:34:53,695
Hi, mom.

677
00:34:53,696 --> 00:34:55,197
Hello, Danny.

678
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,201
Danny...

679
00:34:59,202 --> 00:35:01,203
Stay out of there.

680
00:35:01,204 --> 00:35:04,673
Hello there, young fellow.
Home from school?

681
00:35:04,674 --> 00:35:05,607
What grade you in, son?

682
00:35:05,608 --> 00:35:07,409
Yeah, right.

683
00:35:08,678 --> 00:35:13,682
Well, uh, our lawyer's
just advised me

684
00:35:13,683 --> 00:35:16,685
that, um, I don't
have to talk to you

685
00:35:16,686 --> 00:35:18,787
if I don't want to.

686
00:35:18,788 --> 00:35:21,290
A particular that you
neglected to mention.

687
00:35:21,291 --> 00:35:22,791
Oh, yes, sir,
Mr. Isaacson,

688
00:35:22,792 --> 00:35:24,793
we were just hoping that
you would cooperate with us.

689
00:35:24,794 --> 00:35:26,295
See, we're looking
for some information.

690
00:35:26,296 --> 00:35:27,629
You're a friend
of Dr. Mindish,

691
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:30,632
and you might be able
to help him.

692
00:35:30,633 --> 00:35:33,635
I'll be glad to answer
any of your questions

693
00:35:33,636 --> 00:35:35,871
in a court of law.

694
00:35:35,872 --> 00:35:38,741
Are you denying now
that you know him?

695
00:35:42,545 --> 00:35:44,546
I will answer any questions

696
00:35:44,547 --> 00:35:46,048
in a court of law.

697
00:35:55,892 --> 00:35:57,893
I don't know what they want.

698
00:35:57,894 --> 00:35:59,394
They are fishy.

699
00:35:59,395 --> 00:36:01,196
They're
dumb, clumsy, obvious people.

700
00:36:02,932 --> 00:36:04,866
"Polizei" don't have to be smart.

701
00:36:04,867 --> 00:36:06,268
Don't worry.

702
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:09,771
Mindish is not going to suffer

703
00:36:09,772 --> 00:36:12,341
from anything we say.

704
00:36:12,342 --> 00:36:13,643
There's no reason to be afraid.

705
00:36:15,912 --> 00:36:17,412
They're still here.

706
00:36:17,413 --> 00:36:18,914
What?

707
00:36:25,421 --> 00:36:28,924
That's just part
of the treatment! Huh?

708
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:34,931
Damn them.

709
00:36:37,934 --> 00:36:40,435
They can sit out there forever

710
00:36:40,436 --> 00:36:42,037
for all I care,
huh? Huh?

711
00:36:42,038 --> 00:36:43,039
Come here.

712
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:49,611
You don't understand!
Do you understand that?!

713
00:36:49,612 --> 00:36:52,114
You're not here all the time!

714
00:36:52,115 --> 00:36:54,116
You're behaving
like a child. Now stop it!

715
00:36:54,117 --> 00:36:56,118
You cannot expect
to handle this without a lawyer!

716
00:36:56,119 --> 00:36:57,619
So, who do you recommend?

717
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:59,454
What's his name?
The first one you called.

718
00:36:59,455 --> 00:37:01,456
He wants
no part of it. None of it.

719
00:37:01,457 --> 00:37:03,959
I'm looking in the phone book!

720
00:37:07,964 --> 00:37:10,466
Ascher. Jacob Ascher.

721
00:37:14,804 --> 00:37:17,572
Maniacs... With guns!

722
00:37:17,573 --> 00:37:19,675
They think they've got
John Dillinger.

723
00:37:19,676 --> 00:37:22,210
Haven't you hounded us enough?

724
00:37:22,211 --> 00:37:24,413
Can't you leave us alone?!

725
00:37:55,445 --> 00:37:56,946
Morning.

726
00:38:50,833 --> 00:38:51,834
Let's go.

727
00:38:59,175 --> 00:39:01,676
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!

728
00:39:01,677 --> 00:39:05,180
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

729
00:39:05,181 --> 00:39:06,515
Paul...

730
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:08,750
Ascher!

731
00:39:15,925 --> 00:39:19,928
I suppose I'm a religious man.

732
00:39:19,929 --> 00:39:22,230
For many years now,
when I've had the time,

733
00:39:22,231 --> 00:39:23,965
I've been working on a book

734
00:39:23,966 --> 00:39:26,968
showing the contributions
of the old testament

735
00:39:26,969 --> 00:39:28,971
to American law.

736
00:39:30,473 --> 00:39:33,909
What is happening today
in this country is paganism.

737
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:36,112
That's the only word for it.

738
00:39:38,381 --> 00:39:40,882
He's been indicted,

739
00:39:40,883 --> 00:39:43,385
along with Selig Mindish
and nine others,

740
00:39:43,386 --> 00:39:48,890
for conspiring to violate
the espionage act of 1917.

741
00:39:48,891 --> 00:39:51,894
Bail has been set at $100,000.

742
00:39:53,896 --> 00:39:56,898
On the basis of what evidence?

743
00:39:56,899 --> 00:39:58,400
Well...

744
00:39:58,401 --> 00:40:02,404
A... conspiracy charge
usually requires evidence

745
00:40:02,405 --> 00:40:04,406
like a confession.

746
00:40:04,407 --> 00:40:07,909
Somebody in the conspiracy
has to say it existed.

747
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:09,411
What conspiracy?

748
00:40:09,412 --> 00:40:11,913
In legal terms, it means simply

749
00:40:11,914 --> 00:40:13,915
an agreement among people
to do something,

750
00:40:13,916 --> 00:40:14,916
that they intended
to do something.

751
00:40:14,917 --> 00:40:17,419
Paul...

752
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:20,422
Is not accused
of stealing atomic secrets.

753
00:40:20,423 --> 00:40:22,424
That is correct.

754
00:40:22,425 --> 00:40:25,427
He's accused
of conspiring to steal secrets.

755
00:40:25,428 --> 00:40:26,928
That is correct.

756
00:40:26,929 --> 00:40:27,929
With Selig Mindish.

757
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:29,431
That is correct.

758
00:40:29,432 --> 00:40:31,267
That doesn't sound as serious.

759
00:40:35,071 --> 00:40:37,339
It's as serious as it can be.

760
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:39,841
But if they don't
charge espionage,

761
00:40:39,842 --> 00:40:42,844
but only what,
intending to do espionage,

762
00:40:42,845 --> 00:40:44,346
that means they
have no evidence

763
00:40:44,347 --> 00:40:45,780
that anything was done.

764
00:40:45,781 --> 00:40:46,781
That...
that is correct.

765
00:40:46,782 --> 00:40:48,717
Well, isn't that weaker?

766
00:40:48,718 --> 00:40:50,552
What evidence can you provide

767
00:40:50,553 --> 00:40:51,853
of what was in someone's head?

768
00:40:51,854 --> 00:40:53,855
Tell me.
I don't understand.

769
00:40:53,856 --> 00:40:56,858
As I said, a conspiracy

770
00:40:56,859 --> 00:40:59,861
is, by its nature, secretive.

771
00:40:59,862 --> 00:41:03,131
Only the people in it
can prove its existence.

772
00:41:03,132 --> 00:41:07,135
That's why I think they
have forced a confession.

773
00:41:07,136 --> 00:41:08,036
Who? How can they?

774
00:41:08,037 --> 00:41:10,706
I think they have
Selig Mindish.

775
00:41:13,242 --> 00:41:15,243
Are you all right?
Are you all right?

776
00:41:15,244 --> 00:41:16,745
Where's the boy?
Daniel!

777
00:41:16,746 --> 00:41:18,246
I'm all right.

778
00:41:18,247 --> 00:41:21,049
Help! Bring your mother
a glass of water. Quickly!

779
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:23,018
My God.
Oh, my God.

780
00:41:26,422 --> 00:41:29,925
I think about moving
out of New York.

781
00:41:29,926 --> 00:41:32,928
I think about it all the time.

782
00:41:32,929 --> 00:41:35,931
You know,
after Susan gets well.

783
00:41:35,932 --> 00:41:38,433
Maybe we could go out west

784
00:41:38,434 --> 00:41:40,435
or northwest somewhere.

785
00:41:40,436 --> 00:41:42,437
She's not going to get well.

786
00:41:42,438 --> 00:41:46,442
Some small campus,
when you finish your degree.

787
00:41:47,944 --> 00:41:49,411
What?

788
00:41:49,412 --> 00:41:51,913
It's conceivable.

789
00:41:51,914 --> 00:41:53,415
She may not want to make it.

790
00:41:54,517 --> 00:41:56,652
Daniel, don't talk like that.

791
00:41:59,155 --> 00:42:01,656
She's planning to die on me.

792
00:42:01,657 --> 00:42:03,659
It's the family tradition.

793
00:42:06,162 --> 00:42:07,663
That's gross.

794
00:42:09,665 --> 00:42:12,667
Listen, how can someone
with such a big ass

795
00:42:12,668 --> 00:42:14,136
have such a small brain?

796
00:42:17,206 --> 00:42:21,209
Now listen, my sister Susan
stopped off in the ladies' room

797
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:24,713
at a holiday inn
on the Massachusetts turnpike,

798
00:42:24,714 --> 00:42:26,715
and she slit her wrists

799
00:42:26,716 --> 00:42:29,217
with a stainless steel
razor blade.

800
00:42:29,218 --> 00:42:32,988
I mean, wouldn't you say
something was communicated?

801
00:42:32,989 --> 00:42:34,490
Huh?

802
00:42:36,993 --> 00:42:38,394
I guess.

803
00:42:40,229 --> 00:42:41,730
You guess.

804
00:42:41,731 --> 00:42:44,232
Well, what happened
when we found out?

805
00:42:44,233 --> 00:42:46,234
What did we do?

806
00:42:46,235 --> 00:42:47,736
We went up there.

807
00:42:47,737 --> 00:42:49,738
We went to see her.

808
00:42:49,739 --> 00:42:50,872
You're right.

809
00:42:50,873 --> 00:42:53,375
So it was kind of
a summons, wasn't it?

810
00:42:53,376 --> 00:42:57,380
I mean, what she did
acted on us as kind of a summons, right?

811
00:43:00,349 --> 00:43:02,350
Daniel, when you're unhappy,

812
00:43:02,351 --> 00:43:03,852
you always take it out on me.

813
00:43:05,821 --> 00:43:09,324
Doesn't it bother you
that in Susan's mind

814
00:43:09,325 --> 00:43:12,327
everything
I've done as an adult,

815
00:43:12,328 --> 00:43:14,330
including marrying you...

816
00:43:15,831 --> 00:43:16,832
Is a waste?

817
00:43:19,835 --> 00:43:22,337
Go back to the stacks, Daniel.

818
00:43:23,339 --> 00:43:26,841
The world needs
another graduate student.

819
00:43:26,842 --> 00:43:30,345
Why don't you just admit
that you're a selfish prick?

820
00:43:31,847 --> 00:43:34,349
You cop out
with this phony cynicism.

821
00:43:36,352 --> 00:43:39,855
I'm not ashamed of my name!
I'm proud of who I am!

822
00:43:41,857 --> 00:43:44,359
I mean, what did they die for?

823
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,861
This piece of shit.

824
00:43:49,365 --> 00:43:53,369
They're still fucking us,
Daniel.

825
00:43:55,371 --> 00:43:57,373
You get the picture?

826
00:44:00,928 --> 00:44:02,929
The cake is a big success.

827
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:04,431
I'm glad.

828
00:44:04,432 --> 00:44:08,535
It's not smart
to come here, Ben. You're a foolish man.

829
00:44:08,536 --> 00:44:11,037
Today we have only
police for company.

830
00:44:11,038 --> 00:44:12,772
Police and photographers.

831
00:44:12,773 --> 00:44:15,775
The party in its wisdom
has decided we don't exist.

832
00:44:15,776 --> 00:44:17,277
Would you like more tea?

833
00:44:17,278 --> 00:44:18,778
Don't fuss, don't fuss.

834
00:44:18,779 --> 00:44:21,781
It's all right. I like
to have things to do.

835
00:44:21,782 --> 00:44:25,819
I've been keeping
the store opened since the FBI unsealed it.

836
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:28,989
I thought Paul's
customers would want their property back.

837
00:44:28,990 --> 00:44:31,992
We need every dollar
but nobody comes.

838
00:44:31,993 --> 00:44:33,994
We're contaminated, you see.

839
00:44:33,995 --> 00:44:35,996
What possessed him to do it?
Can you tell me?

840
00:44:35,997 --> 00:44:37,497
All these years.

841
00:44:37,498 --> 00:44:40,000
I just can't understand
what possesses a man

842
00:44:40,001 --> 00:44:41,501
to do something so terrible.

843
00:44:41,502 --> 00:44:45,005
To ruin a family,
the lives of children.

844
00:44:45,006 --> 00:44:46,506
And I can't forgive
his wife either.

845
00:44:46,507 --> 00:44:49,576
There's never been any love lost
between sadie Mindish and me.

846
00:44:49,577 --> 00:44:51,578
God knows what they
concocted between them.

847
00:44:51,579 --> 00:44:53,079
Look, I want you
to tell your lawyer

848
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:55,081
that I'll make myself
useful in any way I can.

849
00:44:55,082 --> 00:44:57,350
I'll testify as your
witness, anything.

850
00:44:57,351 --> 00:44:59,352
Paul discussed
this with Ascher.

851
00:44:59,353 --> 00:45:02,856
Anyone who associates
with us is suspect.

852
00:45:02,857 --> 00:45:06,359
He says he couldn't
bear the responsibility.

853
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,361
Neither could I, Ben.
It's enough to know you've offered.

854
00:45:08,362 --> 00:45:09,362
Some financial help...

855
00:45:09,363 --> 00:45:10,364
I miss him so.

856
00:45:13,367 --> 00:45:15,368
Ascher says he's fine.

857
00:45:15,369 --> 00:45:17,371
His letters say he's fine.

858
00:45:18,873 --> 00:45:21,875
How can a man in jail be fine?

859
00:45:21,876 --> 00:45:24,378
He's locked up
like some common criminal.

860
00:45:28,215 --> 00:45:29,716
Good morning, Daniel.

861
00:45:29,717 --> 00:45:31,718
You remember
Mrs. Bittleman?

862
00:45:31,719 --> 00:45:33,720
She was a friend
of your grandma's.

863
00:45:33,721 --> 00:45:34,722
She's sitting with Susan.

864
00:45:37,725 --> 00:45:39,225
Where are you going?

865
00:45:39,226 --> 00:45:41,227
I have to go downtown

866
00:45:41,228 --> 00:45:43,229
to testify
before the grand jury.

867
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:45,231
Thank God
for Mrs. Bittleman.

868
00:45:45,232 --> 00:45:47,734
She lost her son
Jerome in the war.

869
00:45:47,735 --> 00:45:49,736
For her, misery
has no politics.

870
00:45:49,737 --> 00:45:51,237
How does this look?

871
00:45:51,238 --> 00:45:54,240
Good.

872
00:45:54,241 --> 00:45:56,743
You want to shut
the clasp for me?

873
00:46:06,754 --> 00:46:09,757
Your father gave me this
before we were married.

874
00:46:11,759 --> 00:46:14,261
This I won't pawn,
no matter what.

875
00:46:22,269 --> 00:46:24,270
Danny.

876
00:46:24,271 --> 00:46:25,772
Don't go.

877
00:46:25,773 --> 00:46:27,273
I don't want you to go.

878
00:46:27,274 --> 00:46:29,275
But I have to go.

879
00:46:29,276 --> 00:46:33,780
The government lawyers
want to talk to me about your father.

880
00:46:33,781 --> 00:46:37,284
I'll be able to tell them
what a terrible thing they're doing.

881
00:46:44,792 --> 00:46:47,795
I always forget
how young you are.

882
00:46:49,797 --> 00:46:53,299
You are such a big, brave boy,

883
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:56,302
and you take
such good care of Susan,

884
00:46:56,303 --> 00:46:57,804
I forget you're a baby, too.

885
00:46:57,805 --> 00:46:59,305
I'm not a baby.

886
00:46:59,306 --> 00:47:01,308
You're my baby.

887
00:47:06,313 --> 00:47:09,816
I should be back
before you're out of school.

888
00:47:09,817 --> 00:47:12,819
In case I'm not,

889
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:15,322
have a snack
and take Susan to the park.

890
00:47:16,323 --> 00:47:19,826
For lunch, I made you
a peanut butter sandwich

891
00:47:19,827 --> 00:47:21,828
and an apple.

892
00:47:21,829 --> 00:47:23,330
In the icebox.

893
00:48:03,537 --> 00:48:05,338
Your mama leave you here alone?

894
00:48:07,108 --> 00:48:09,109
Mrs. Bittleman
was here,

895
00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:11,744
but she went home
to make us some dinner.

896
00:48:11,745 --> 00:48:13,747
Ain't nobody told you?

897
00:48:16,217 --> 00:48:17,217
What?

898
00:48:17,218 --> 00:48:21,722
Dear Jesus.
Is on the radio.

899
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,529
I'm a widow.
I have no one.

900
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:32,031
I stand on my feet
12 hours a day.

901
00:48:32,032 --> 00:48:34,467
How can I afford to do
what you're asking?

902
00:48:34,468 --> 00:48:36,970
Mrs. Stein,
I'm not asking you to do anything.

903
00:48:36,971 --> 00:48:39,305
Paul's your brother, not mine.

904
00:48:39,306 --> 00:48:43,309
God help me. I was always
the responsible one.

905
00:48:43,310 --> 00:48:45,812
From the time we were children,

906
00:48:45,813 --> 00:48:47,313
if you didn't
put his food in front of him,

907
00:48:47,314 --> 00:48:48,314
he wouldn't eat.

908
00:48:48,315 --> 00:48:50,817
If you didn't
hold his money for him, he would lose it.

909
00:48:50,818 --> 00:48:52,785
It was always Frieda...

910
00:48:52,786 --> 00:48:54,787
the good-natured slob.

911
00:48:54,788 --> 00:48:57,290
They seem to enjoy
the television.

912
00:48:57,291 --> 00:48:59,792
Do you have
a television, Mrs. Stein?

913
00:48:59,793 --> 00:49:02,295
What? No.
Who can afford it?

914
00:49:02,296 --> 00:49:04,797
It's an expensive item.

915
00:49:04,798 --> 00:49:08,801
When the dealer
comes to assess the belongings,

916
00:49:08,802 --> 00:49:11,104
I'll tell him
not to include the television.

917
00:49:11,105 --> 00:49:13,840
Can there be a greater tragedy?

918
00:49:13,841 --> 00:49:15,842
My Paulie, a communist...

919
00:49:15,843 --> 00:49:17,143
And worse.

920
00:49:17,144 --> 00:49:18,111
What do you mean, worse?

921
00:49:18,112 --> 00:49:20,513
God only knows!

922
00:49:20,514 --> 00:49:22,015
I'm lucky if I keep my store.

923
00:49:22,016 --> 00:49:23,516
If someone should
make the connection,

924
00:49:23,517 --> 00:49:25,018
if someone should find out...

925
00:49:25,019 --> 00:49:26,519
What are you saying?

926
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:28,021
How do I explain
who these children are,

927
00:49:28,022 --> 00:49:30,524
how do I explain
where their parents are?

928
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:35,161
Their parents are in jail.

929
00:49:35,162 --> 00:49:38,665
They're in jail
because their bail Bond is prohibitive.

930
00:49:38,666 --> 00:49:40,166
It helps the government

931
00:49:40,167 --> 00:49:41,968
establish
how dangerous they must be.

932
00:49:41,969 --> 00:49:43,703
If the shame
of that is too much for you,

933
00:49:43,704 --> 00:49:45,171
say they're in Florida.

934
00:49:45,172 --> 00:49:46,673
I don't blame him.

935
00:49:47,675 --> 00:49:49,676
He couldn't help himself.

936
00:49:49,677 --> 00:49:51,678
She is his ruination.

937
00:49:51,679 --> 00:49:54,681
In school, he had a 96 average.

938
00:49:54,682 --> 00:49:56,182
Townsend Harris High School...

939
00:49:56,183 --> 00:49:57,684
which is nothing but
brilliant children.

940
00:49:57,685 --> 00:49:59,686
And then
to go and get these crazy ideas!

941
00:49:59,687 --> 00:50:01,187
All right. So you
join a radical club,

942
00:50:01,188 --> 00:50:03,189
it's the thing to do.

943
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:05,191
He would
have outgrown all that craziness,

944
00:50:05,192 --> 00:50:06,693
but she drove him.

945
00:50:06,694 --> 00:50:08,194
She is the one who did this!

946
00:50:08,195 --> 00:50:11,197
Mrs. Stein, do you
really want the children to hear all this?

947
00:50:11,198 --> 00:50:13,200
Oy-vey-zmeir.

948
00:50:15,703 --> 00:50:16,704
So...

949
00:50:17,705 --> 00:50:21,208
What am I to understand
from your answer?

950
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:24,711
They can't stay here.

951
00:50:24,712 --> 00:50:26,212
There's no money.

952
00:50:26,213 --> 00:50:28,715
The black man can't take them.

953
00:50:28,716 --> 00:50:30,718
The neighbor can't take them.

954
00:50:32,219 --> 00:50:33,553
I can't take them.

955
00:50:33,554 --> 00:50:37,357
Babies. What do
I know from babies?

956
00:50:37,358 --> 00:50:39,359
Where will I put them?

957
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:41,161
What do they eat?

958
00:50:45,165 --> 00:50:46,666
Lady...

959
00:50:47,668 --> 00:50:50,671
They are not animals
from the zoo.

960
00:50:56,677 --> 00:50:58,178
Have you no pity?

961
00:50:59,179 --> 00:51:02,181
Don't... don't you
know what trouble is?

962
00:51:02,182 --> 00:51:07,187
Don't you know
what terrible trouble these people are in?

963
00:51:24,538 --> 00:51:26,039
Go ahead. Take it.

964
00:51:28,042 --> 00:51:29,542
I'm not making promises.

965
00:51:29,543 --> 00:51:32,045
I'll do my best.
But that's all.

966
00:52:09,116 --> 00:52:11,117
You remember the trial?

967
00:52:11,118 --> 00:52:13,119
We weren't allowed to go.

968
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:14,554
The government had no case.

969
00:52:14,555 --> 00:52:16,456
All they had was Mindish,

970
00:52:16,457 --> 00:52:18,257
the testimony of an accomplice.

971
00:52:18,258 --> 00:52:20,493
They had to believe
it was possible

972
00:52:20,494 --> 00:52:23,496
for a radio repairman
without training or education

973
00:52:23,497 --> 00:52:26,499
to draw up plans of the most
sophisticated technology

974
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:28,000
and then reduce them

975
00:52:28,001 --> 00:52:30,870
so they'd fit
on dental X-ray film...

976
00:52:30,871 --> 00:52:33,206
it was all too much...

977
00:52:33,207 --> 00:52:36,542
and that this stuff
was valuable to the Russians.

978
00:52:36,543 --> 00:52:38,044
You know, it was insane.

979
00:52:38,045 --> 00:52:40,546
The Russians had
everything they wanted.

980
00:52:40,547 --> 00:52:42,048
They had their own men
right there on the spot.

981
00:52:42,049 --> 00:52:43,549
You sure you don't
want something?

982
00:52:43,550 --> 00:52:46,552
The New York times
is a big spender.

983
00:52:46,553 --> 00:52:47,553
No, thanks.

984
00:52:47,554 --> 00:52:48,555
Anyway...

985
00:52:50,057 --> 00:52:52,058
The day after the times

986
00:52:52,059 --> 00:52:55,061
ran my 10th-anniversary
reassessment piece on the case,

987
00:52:55,062 --> 00:52:57,063
I was having lunch downtown.

988
00:52:57,064 --> 00:52:59,065
And just as I'm leaving
the restaurant,

989
00:52:59,066 --> 00:53:01,868
Red Foyerman
comes up behind me.

990
00:53:01,869 --> 00:53:03,636
The chief prosecuting attorney.

991
00:53:03,637 --> 00:53:05,638
Well, he's judge Foyerman now,

992
00:53:05,639 --> 00:53:07,140
of the Southern district.

993
00:53:07,141 --> 00:53:08,641
It was
a career-making case.

994
00:53:08,642 --> 00:53:10,143
Everybody did well.

995
00:53:10,144 --> 00:53:12,645
Anyway, uh, Foyerman
grabs my elbow

996
00:53:12,646 --> 00:53:15,148
like it was a tit or something.

997
00:53:15,149 --> 00:53:17,150
He says, "Jack, can't believe

998
00:53:17,151 --> 00:53:20,153
"that you let
the wrong guys get to you.

999
00:53:20,154 --> 00:53:23,156
I can't believe
you buy their story."

1000
00:53:23,157 --> 00:53:24,657
"What story, red?

1001
00:53:24,658 --> 00:53:27,660
"You're not going to stand there
and tell me, without smiling,

1002
00:53:27,661 --> 00:53:29,896
that you guys
had a case."

1003
00:53:29,897 --> 00:53:32,899
"Someday when you have
the time," he says,

1004
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:34,901
"come up to my office.

1005
00:53:34,902 --> 00:53:36,903
And I'll show you
some things."

1006
00:53:36,904 --> 00:53:38,304
What things?

1007
00:53:38,305 --> 00:53:40,173
It's bullshit.

1008
00:53:40,174 --> 00:53:42,175
They all talk that way.

1009
00:53:42,176 --> 00:53:43,676
Even before the execution,

1010
00:53:43,677 --> 00:53:46,679
when the heat was on
to commute the sentence,

1011
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:49,682
they kept dropping these hints
about testimony they had

1012
00:53:49,683 --> 00:53:52,552
that they couldn't
reveal because of national security,

1013
00:53:52,553 --> 00:53:55,421
like there's supposed to be this big
report in the justice department?

1014
00:53:55,422 --> 00:53:57,423
Well, a friend of mine
in justice told me

1015
00:53:57,424 --> 00:53:59,926
if they had evidence like that,

1016
00:53:59,927 --> 00:54:01,427
they'd have used it, all right.

1017
00:54:01,428 --> 00:54:03,429
Well, there's a report,
all right.

1018
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:06,766
The reason it's classified is
because it favors the defense.

1019
00:54:10,270 --> 00:54:12,271
I'm glad you popped up.

1020
00:54:12,272 --> 00:54:14,774
And I'm glad you're
alive and kicking.

1021
00:54:14,775 --> 00:54:16,275
Now...

1022
00:54:16,276 --> 00:54:20,112
Now what is the name
of your foundation, hmm?

1023
00:54:20,113 --> 00:54:24,116
The Isaacson
foundation for revolutionary studies.

1024
00:54:24,117 --> 00:54:26,118
What's it supposed to do?

1025
00:54:26,119 --> 00:54:28,120
We're going to fund
community action programs.

1026
00:54:28,121 --> 00:54:30,122
We're going to start
a magazine maybe,

1027
00:54:30,123 --> 00:54:32,492
raise revolutionary
consciousness, everything.

1028
00:54:32,493 --> 00:54:36,162
Great. Can you tell me
where the money is coming from?

1029
00:54:36,163 --> 00:54:38,498
Yeah. It's no secret.
It's our trust money.

1030
00:54:38,499 --> 00:54:40,500
That the old lawyer
put together...

1031
00:54:40,501 --> 00:54:42,001
from the defense committee?

1032
00:54:42,002 --> 00:54:43,002
Right.

1033
00:54:43,003 --> 00:54:44,170
How much?

1034
00:54:44,171 --> 00:54:45,671
Uh, well, I can
find out for you.

1035
00:54:45,672 --> 00:54:47,073
I haven't been counting.

1036
00:54:48,408 --> 00:54:49,909
That's beautiful.

1037
00:54:49,910 --> 00:54:51,411
You're all right.

1038
00:54:52,412 --> 00:54:54,113
Uh, where's your sister?

1039
00:54:54,114 --> 00:54:56,115
I'd like to talk to her.

1040
00:54:56,116 --> 00:55:00,152
Well, I don't think
she wants to talk to anyone right now.

1041
00:55:00,153 --> 00:55:02,154
She's recovering
from the trial.

1042
00:55:02,155 --> 00:55:04,156
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1043
00:55:04,157 --> 00:55:06,158
Yeah, I think I heard
something like that.

1044
00:55:06,159 --> 00:55:08,160
How old is she now?

1045
00:55:08,161 --> 00:55:09,662
Susan's 20.

1046
00:55:09,663 --> 00:55:11,031
And where is she?

1047
00:55:12,833 --> 00:55:14,200
Out of state.

1048
00:55:14,201 --> 00:55:17,003
That's all I can tell you.

1049
00:55:17,004 --> 00:55:19,005
Well, how about
your foster parents?

1050
00:55:19,006 --> 00:55:21,040
Can I talk to them?

1051
00:55:21,041 --> 00:55:24,644
Look, I don't care
about blowing our cover.

1052
00:55:24,645 --> 00:55:26,479
I don't think any
of us care anymore.

1053
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:29,982
Whoever's interested,
they could have traced us up to Boston.

1054
00:55:29,983 --> 00:55:31,484
But I mean there are
certain family things

1055
00:55:31,485 --> 00:55:33,486
that have to be
settled by all of us

1056
00:55:33,487 --> 00:55:34,987
and not me acting alone.

1057
00:55:34,988 --> 00:55:37,490
I mean, we got
responsibilities to each other.

1058
00:55:37,491 --> 00:55:39,859
Kid, you called me.

1059
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:41,861
Yeah, I know, but
I'm trying to lay the foundation

1060
00:55:41,862 --> 00:55:42,995
on you, not the family.

1061
00:55:42,996 --> 00:55:44,330
It's the same story, isn't it?

1062
00:55:44,331 --> 00:55:45,331
What?

1063
00:55:45,332 --> 00:55:47,833
Don't worry. I don't
fuck around, but...

1064
00:55:47,834 --> 00:55:50,203
What you're trying to do
is impossible.

1065
00:55:52,506 --> 00:55:54,574
What?
Clear their names.

1066
00:55:54,575 --> 00:55:56,075
No, that's not what
we're trying to do.

1067
00:55:56,076 --> 00:55:59,078
Oh, sure, sure, sure. Well,
let me tell you something.

1068
00:55:59,079 --> 00:56:01,914
A radical is no better
than his analysis. You should know that.

1069
00:56:01,915 --> 00:56:05,851
Your folks were set up
on a bad rap.

1070
00:56:05,852 --> 00:56:07,820
But that doesn't mean
they were innocent babes.

1071
00:56:07,821 --> 00:56:10,823
Well, I don't believe they
were a dangerous conspiracy

1072
00:56:10,824 --> 00:56:12,358
passing defense secrets,
but I don't believe either

1073
00:56:12,359 --> 00:56:15,728
there was a conspiracy
in Washington against them.

1074
00:56:15,729 --> 00:56:17,663
I thought you said
the evidence was phony.

1075
00:56:17,664 --> 00:56:20,166
That's right. Those guys had
to bring in a conviction.

1076
00:56:20,167 --> 00:56:21,867
That was their job.

1077
00:56:21,868 --> 00:56:24,370
In this country, people
don't get picked out of a hat

1078
00:56:24,371 --> 00:56:26,439
to be put on trial
for their lives.

1079
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:28,674
Your parents were
up to something.

1080
00:56:28,675 --> 00:56:30,176
They had to be.

1081
00:56:30,177 --> 00:56:32,178
They were little
neighborhood commies

1082
00:56:32,179 --> 00:56:33,879
with a third-rate operation.

1083
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:35,381
Probably meant Bupkus.

1084
00:56:35,382 --> 00:56:38,618
What they were doing was
worth maybe five years. Maybe.

1085
00:56:38,619 --> 00:56:41,621
But that would've been
in the best of times.

1086
00:56:41,622 --> 00:56:45,725
In the best of times, nobody would
have cared enough to falsify evidence.

1087
00:56:45,726 --> 00:56:49,596
Nobody would have
been afraid enough to throw a switch.

1088
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:55,701
One of the most
emotional moments

1089
00:56:55,702 --> 00:56:57,703
in the history of congress.

1090
00:56:57,704 --> 00:56:59,705
General MacArthur stood
and spoke

1091
00:56:59,706 --> 00:57:02,208
as a nation
stopped and listened.

1092
00:57:05,212 --> 00:57:08,715
I know war as few other men...

1093
00:57:17,124 --> 00:57:19,126
hi, my dearest Danny.

1094
00:57:20,594 --> 00:57:22,995
What do you think of Brooklyn?

1095
00:57:22,996 --> 00:57:24,497
Is it interesting?

1096
00:57:24,498 --> 00:57:27,900
Have you made any friends yet?

1097
00:57:27,901 --> 00:57:30,970
I know it's boring for you
to be out of school, my honey,

1098
00:57:30,971 --> 00:57:32,972
but this is only temporary.

1099
00:57:32,973 --> 00:57:34,974
In the meantime,

1100
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:37,476
you should get aunt Frieda
to take you to the library

1101
00:57:37,477 --> 00:57:39,578
and get lots of books.

1102
00:57:39,579 --> 00:57:41,080
Mr. Ascher, Uncle Jacob,

1103
00:57:41,081 --> 00:57:43,582
is trying to get you into
the public school there

1104
00:57:43,583 --> 00:57:46,085
but that
may take a few more days.

1105
00:57:46,086 --> 00:57:47,586
My beloved little Susan

1106
00:57:47,587 --> 00:57:49,789
will go to nursery school.

1107
00:57:51,291 --> 00:57:53,292
Listen, my dear sweetheart.

1108
00:57:53,293 --> 00:57:55,294
Uncle Jacob will
be bringing a present

1109
00:57:55,295 --> 00:57:56,796
for each of you from us.

1110
00:57:56,797 --> 00:58:00,800
I hope you enjoy it.
Your father and I discussed

1111
00:58:00,801 --> 00:58:02,301
what we would get
you in our letters

1112
00:58:02,302 --> 00:58:04,303
since we are
in different jails,

1113
00:58:04,304 --> 00:58:07,306
and we have asked him
to purchase it

1114
00:58:07,307 --> 00:58:09,308
from the store
and bring it to you.

1115
00:58:09,309 --> 00:58:12,311
By the way, I'm writing
this for your father, too.

1116
00:58:12,312 --> 00:58:15,314
He wants to tell you
not to worry about us

1117
00:58:15,315 --> 00:58:16,315
because we are fine,

1118
00:58:16,316 --> 00:58:18,818
and everything
is all right with us,

1119
00:58:18,819 --> 00:58:21,821
even though
we miss you very much.

1120
00:58:21,822 --> 00:58:25,324
Please write me again,
my sweet angel boy.

1121
00:58:25,325 --> 00:58:28,327
I enjoy your letters so much.

1122
00:58:28,328 --> 00:58:31,130
Tell me what is on your mind.

1123
00:58:31,131 --> 00:58:33,632
You are such a comfort to me.

1124
00:58:33,633 --> 00:58:36,535
Please cooperate with your aunt

1125
00:58:36,536 --> 00:58:38,537
and take care of your sister.

1126
00:58:38,538 --> 00:58:41,540
I know you'd do that
without my even asking.

1127
00:58:41,541 --> 00:58:44,543
And before you know it,
we'll all be together again.

1128
00:58:44,544 --> 00:58:47,546
With lots and lots of love,

1129
00:58:47,547 --> 00:58:49,048
your mom.

1130
00:58:58,492 --> 00:58:59,992
Settle down here!

1131
00:58:59,993 --> 00:59:02,495
What is this, some fuckin' zoo?

1132
00:59:02,496 --> 00:59:04,997
All right. Come on.

1133
00:59:04,998 --> 00:59:07,500
Now, listen, somebody get
El stupido down in his bed.

1134
00:59:07,501 --> 00:59:09,502
Otherwise, he'll
stand there all night.

1135
00:59:09,503 --> 00:59:10,503
Ok?

1136
00:59:10,504 --> 00:59:13,506
All right. No more
trouble tonight, you hear?

1137
00:59:13,507 --> 00:59:15,007
Otherwise, I'm kick some ass.

1138
00:59:15,008 --> 00:59:18,678
I catch anybody jerking off,
I'm gonna tie it in knots.

1139
00:59:58,490 --> 00:59:59,991
Aah!

1140
01:00:27,619 --> 01:00:30,388
Daniel!

1141
01:00:30,389 --> 01:00:32,089
Hey! Get back here.

1142
01:00:32,090 --> 01:00:33,524
Hey!

1143
01:00:34,526 --> 01:00:37,528
How many times do I
have to tell you?

1144
01:00:37,529 --> 01:00:39,363
To stay with your own...

1145
01:00:40,666 --> 01:00:42,334
Why you little bitch!

1146
01:00:54,580 --> 01:00:57,081
So, let's forget
your throwing the tray.

1147
01:00:57,082 --> 01:01:01,086
I would probably have
done the same thing if it was my sister.

1148
01:01:02,087 --> 01:01:03,888
It's Susan who worries me.

1149
01:01:03,889 --> 01:01:06,657
She's giving us
a very hard time.

1150
01:01:06,658 --> 01:01:09,827
She doesn't eat. She keeps
the other kids awake.

1151
01:01:09,828 --> 01:01:12,830
She won't cooperate
in anything.

1152
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:15,333
Do you have any ideas?

1153
01:01:15,334 --> 01:01:18,336
I mean, what do you think
the problem is?

1154
01:01:18,337 --> 01:01:19,971
She thinks it's a jail.

1155
01:01:19,972 --> 01:01:21,472
Jail?

1156
01:01:21,473 --> 01:01:23,341
Why?

1157
01:01:23,342 --> 01:01:26,744
In jail, people
are kept apart from each other.

1158
01:01:26,745 --> 01:01:29,080
Well, there are rules here.

1159
01:01:29,081 --> 01:01:31,082
The boys are in one section,

1160
01:01:31,083 --> 01:01:33,452
the girls in another.
Those are the rules.

1161
01:01:34,953 --> 01:01:36,454
Sir, that's like a jail.

1162
01:01:38,924 --> 01:01:40,925
Dan, this is not a jail.

1163
01:01:40,926 --> 01:01:43,461
It's the east Bronx
children's shelter.

1164
01:01:43,462 --> 01:01:47,465
Did I ask you to come here?

1165
01:01:47,466 --> 01:01:48,799
No.

1166
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:51,802
Did I force Susan to come here?

1167
01:01:51,803 --> 01:01:52,803
No.

1168
01:01:52,804 --> 01:01:54,338
No.

1169
01:01:54,339 --> 01:01:57,308
Then how could it be a jail?

1170
01:01:57,309 --> 01:01:59,110
I don't know.

1171
01:01:59,111 --> 01:02:03,347
You're here because your parents asked
the city if you could stay here.

1172
01:02:03,348 --> 01:02:06,984
Are you saying
your own parents would put you in jail?

1173
01:02:08,987 --> 01:02:11,822
They don't
put children in jail.

1174
01:02:11,823 --> 01:02:15,326
In this country, they don't put
anyone in jail without a trial.

1175
01:02:15,327 --> 01:02:18,329
My mother and father
haven't had a trial.

1176
01:02:18,330 --> 01:02:20,031
Well, they're...

1177
01:02:20,032 --> 01:02:22,199
They're waiting
for their trial.

1178
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:25,503
Why can't they wait
at home with us?

1179
01:02:25,504 --> 01:02:27,004
I don't know, Dan.

1180
01:02:27,005 --> 01:02:28,506
I'm not a lawyer.

1181
01:02:28,507 --> 01:02:31,509
Maybe, uh, they're...

1182
01:02:31,510 --> 01:02:34,011
The government's
afraid they would try and run away.

1183
01:02:34,012 --> 01:02:36,514
Well, they wouldn't
be afraid of that

1184
01:02:36,515 --> 01:02:40,452
unless they were
going to kill them.

1185
01:02:43,322 --> 01:02:45,691
Have you discussed this
with Susan?

1186
01:02:47,526 --> 01:02:48,993
No.

1187
01:02:48,994 --> 01:02:50,494
Does Susan think

1188
01:02:50,495 --> 01:02:53,498
this is a jail where
children are killed?

1189
01:03:00,372 --> 01:03:03,874
All right.
Do you have to go to the bathroom?

1190
01:03:03,875 --> 01:03:05,376
No.

1191
01:03:05,377 --> 01:03:08,879
I don't know where
to find any bathroom.

1192
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:11,882
So you better go now,
just to make sure.

1193
01:03:11,883 --> 01:03:13,384
I'll wait for you.

1194
01:03:13,385 --> 01:03:14,885
I don't.

1195
01:03:14,886 --> 01:03:16,887
Now the most important thing

1196
01:03:16,888 --> 01:03:19,056
is to listen to me carefully.

1197
01:03:19,057 --> 01:03:22,059
Do what I tell you,
and don't argue.

1198
01:03:22,060 --> 01:03:23,561
Say you promise.

1199
01:03:23,562 --> 01:03:25,062
I promise.

1200
01:03:25,063 --> 01:03:26,564
Get ready.

1201
01:03:33,538 --> 01:03:34,539
Go.

1202
01:03:47,552 --> 01:03:48,552
Don't run.

1203
01:03:48,553 --> 01:03:51,556
'Cause if you run,
lot of people will notice you.

1204
01:04:14,146 --> 01:04:19,150
This little light of mine

1205
01:04:19,151 --> 01:04:24,155
I'm gonna let it shine

1206
01:04:24,156 --> 01:04:29,493
this little light of mine

1207
01:04:29,494 --> 01:04:34,498
I'm gonna let it shine

1208
01:04:34,499 --> 01:04:40,004
this little light of mine

1209
01:04:40,005 --> 01:04:44,508
I'm gonna let it shine

1210
01:04:44,509 --> 01:04:46,944
let it shine

1211
01:04:46,945 --> 01:04:49,447
let it shine

1212
01:04:49,448 --> 01:04:54,452
let it shine

1213
01:04:54,453 --> 01:04:56,454
Not so fast.

1214
01:04:56,455 --> 01:04:58,456
You're going to make me fall.

1215
01:04:58,457 --> 01:05:03,861
Everywhere I go

1216
01:05:03,862 --> 01:05:07,364
I'm gonna let it shine

1217
01:05:07,365 --> 01:05:08,866
Are you tired?

1218
01:05:08,867 --> 01:05:10,367
Yes.

1219
01:05:10,368 --> 01:05:13,871
Everywhere I go

1220
01:05:13,872 --> 01:05:18,876
I'm gonna let it shine

1221
01:05:18,877 --> 01:05:24,882
everywhere I go

1222
01:05:24,883 --> 01:05:29,386
I'm gonna let it shine

1223
01:05:29,387 --> 01:05:32,089
let it shine

1224
01:05:32,090 --> 01:05:34,592
let it shine

1225
01:05:34,593 --> 01:05:37,094
let it shine

1226
01:05:37,095 --> 01:05:39,096
What are you crying about?

1227
01:05:39,097 --> 01:05:40,565
I'm not.

1228
01:05:43,502 --> 01:05:49,006
Oh, the cool of night

1229
01:05:49,007 --> 01:05:50,508
How much more?

1230
01:05:50,509 --> 01:05:52,510
Are we going to be there soon?

1231
01:05:52,511 --> 01:05:53,512
Be quiet.

1232
01:05:55,013 --> 01:06:00,017
All through the night

1233
01:06:00,018 --> 01:06:05,523
I'm gonna let it shine

1234
01:06:05,524 --> 01:06:12,530
all through the night

1235
01:06:12,531 --> 01:06:14,532
I know where we are!

1236
01:06:14,533 --> 01:06:17,034
I can see our house!

1237
01:06:17,035 --> 01:06:19,537
Let it shine

1238
01:06:19,538 --> 01:06:22,540
let it shine

1239
01:06:22,541 --> 01:06:27,946
let it shine

1240
01:08:23,495 --> 01:08:25,996
What can I tell you?

1241
01:08:25,997 --> 01:08:28,733
Some people are singled out.

1242
01:08:29,734 --> 01:08:32,236
I would run away, too.

1243
01:08:32,237 --> 01:08:35,239
Thank God I knew where to look.

1244
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:37,741
Do you enjoy
these Halloween presents?

1245
01:08:37,742 --> 01:08:40,244
Huh?

1246
01:08:40,245 --> 01:08:44,748
This family has given me
itself as a present.

1247
01:08:44,749 --> 01:08:47,751
Oh, my children.

1248
01:08:47,752 --> 01:08:49,253
What can I tell you?

1249
01:08:50,255 --> 01:08:52,256
Soon...

1250
01:08:52,257 --> 01:08:55,259
Soon we will be in court.

1251
01:08:55,260 --> 01:08:57,762
We shall have our trial.

1252
01:08:59,965 --> 01:09:03,418
Knouting was the primary
means of punishment

1253
01:09:03,419 --> 01:09:06,421
for capital offenses
in Czarist Russia.

1254
01:09:06,422 --> 01:09:09,924
It was used
exclusively on serfs,

1255
01:09:09,925 --> 01:09:11,426
just as drawing and quartering

1256
01:09:11,427 --> 01:09:14,929
was reserved for the lower
classes of England.

1257
01:09:14,930 --> 01:09:18,433
The institution of serfdom
depended on the use

1258
01:09:18,434 --> 01:09:21,102
of savage corporal punishment.

1259
01:09:21,103 --> 01:09:23,604
Knouting was also popular
in military services

1260
01:09:23,605 --> 01:09:29,510
of Europe and on plantations
in the American South.

1261
01:09:45,527 --> 01:09:47,528
You are a student still?

1262
01:09:47,529 --> 01:09:49,030
Yes.

1263
01:09:49,031 --> 01:09:50,531
Married with a baby?

1264
01:09:50,532 --> 01:09:52,033
Yes, yes.

1265
01:09:52,034 --> 01:09:54,035
Your sister?

1266
01:09:54,036 --> 01:09:56,037
She's getting better.

1267
01:09:56,038 --> 01:09:58,073
Still...
Yeah, yeah.

1268
01:10:00,075 --> 01:10:02,643
I don't want to take
up a lot of your time, Mrs. Ascher.

1269
01:10:02,644 --> 01:10:03,644
My time?

1270
01:10:03,645 --> 01:10:07,148
What do you think
I do with my time?

1271
01:10:07,149 --> 01:10:09,150
See, I wanted to know if
there were any papers.

1272
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:11,853
Maybe letters
you know about, files.

1273
01:10:11,854 --> 01:10:15,356
Papers, letters?

1274
01:10:15,357 --> 01:10:16,858
Yeah. See, uh...

1275
01:10:16,859 --> 01:10:19,394
Well, I guess I think
they belong to me.

1276
01:10:19,395 --> 01:10:21,396
There are none.

1277
01:10:21,397 --> 01:10:23,398
Robert Lewin has all the files.

1278
01:10:23,399 --> 01:10:24,432
I gave him everything.

1279
01:10:24,433 --> 01:10:27,402
When Jacob died,

1280
01:10:27,403 --> 01:10:29,904
when I sold the practice
and closed the office,

1281
01:10:29,905 --> 01:10:33,408
I had to first clean up
the garbage of 35 years.

1282
01:10:33,409 --> 01:10:35,410
He threw away nothing.

1283
01:10:35,411 --> 01:10:37,912
For months,
I went through papers.

1284
01:10:37,913 --> 01:10:40,915
It was very difficult
for me. I made myself ill.

1285
01:10:40,916 --> 01:10:45,420
Robert Lewin didn't
want the practice.

1286
01:10:45,421 --> 01:10:47,588
Can I get you something?

1287
01:10:47,589 --> 01:10:50,091
A glass of milk?

1288
01:10:50,092 --> 01:10:52,527
No.

1289
01:10:52,528 --> 01:10:54,028
You know, there was a point

1290
01:10:54,029 --> 01:10:58,266
Jacob and I seriously discussed
adopting you ourselves.

1291
01:10:58,267 --> 01:11:00,735
I didn't know that.

1292
01:11:00,736 --> 01:11:02,637
It is true.

1293
01:11:02,638 --> 01:11:05,640
How we would have managed it
at our age I can't tell you.

1294
01:11:05,641 --> 01:11:07,642
It was his idea,
of course, not mine.

1295
01:11:07,643 --> 01:11:13,114
I held my breath and
he talked himself out of it.

1296
01:11:13,115 --> 01:11:16,050
Only after he died did I think

1297
01:11:16,051 --> 01:11:18,986
maybe he knew he hadn't long.

1298
01:11:18,987 --> 01:11:21,489
And that's why he
decided to quit.

1299
01:11:21,490 --> 01:11:24,493
Otherwise, who knows...

1300
01:11:26,829 --> 01:11:29,731
Well, he was very kind to us.

1301
01:11:31,066 --> 01:11:33,034
Your parents should
have been so kind.

1302
01:11:34,470 --> 01:11:36,971
I don't know what to tell you.

1303
01:11:36,972 --> 01:11:39,474
I have no love
for the memory of your parents.

1304
01:11:39,475 --> 01:11:43,478
They were communists
and they destroyed everything they touched.

1305
01:11:43,479 --> 01:11:45,480
You don't think
they were innocent?

1306
01:11:45,481 --> 01:11:47,982
They were not innocent
in permitting themselves

1307
01:11:47,983 --> 01:11:52,019
to be used and in using other
people in their fanaticism.

1308
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:53,688
Innocent?

1309
01:11:53,689 --> 01:11:58,192
The case ruined Jacob's health.

1310
01:11:58,193 --> 01:12:00,194
They were very difficult
to deal with.

1311
01:12:00,195 --> 01:12:01,195
They were very stubborn.

1312
01:12:01,196 --> 01:12:03,197
He would come home furious.

1313
01:12:03,198 --> 01:12:05,867
He wanted to do something
and they wouldn't let him.

1314
01:12:05,868 --> 01:12:08,369
He wanted to do something
for their sake

1315
01:12:08,370 --> 01:12:09,370
and they wouldn't allow it.

1316
01:12:09,371 --> 01:12:10,271
Like what?

1317
01:12:11,607 --> 01:12:14,609
He wanted to call certain
people as witnesses.

1318
01:12:14,610 --> 01:12:16,110
And they wouldn't let him.

1319
01:12:16,111 --> 01:12:17,612
All sorts of things like that.

1320
01:12:17,613 --> 01:12:19,113
Who... who... who did
he want to call as a witness?

1321
01:12:19,114 --> 01:12:20,115
Who knows?!

1322
01:12:22,117 --> 01:12:24,619
Jacob was a very
brilliant lawyer.

1323
01:12:24,620 --> 01:12:27,622
And today, whenever
they talk about the case,

1324
01:12:27,623 --> 01:12:30,358
it is Jacob they criticize.

1325
01:12:30,359 --> 01:12:31,893
He should have done that,
he shouldn't have done that.

1326
01:12:31,894 --> 01:12:36,465
Do they know what
he had to put up with?

1327
01:13:16,939 --> 01:13:21,442
I do not know

1328
01:13:21,443 --> 01:13:24,445
why oft' round me

1329
01:13:24,446 --> 01:13:29,450
my hopes all shattered

1330
01:13:29,451 --> 01:13:32,453
seem to be

1331
01:13:32,454 --> 01:13:35,957
God's perfect plan

1332
01:13:35,958 --> 01:13:40,461
I cannot see

1333
01:13:40,462 --> 01:13:42,964
but someday

1334
01:13:42,965 --> 01:13:48,469
I'll understand

1335
01:13:48,470 --> 01:13:50,972
someday

1336
01:13:50,973 --> 01:13:56,477
he'll make it plain to me

1337
01:13:56,478 --> 01:13:57,979
someday

1338
01:13:57,980 --> 01:13:58,980
Susan, please!

1339
01:13:58,981 --> 01:14:03,985
When I his face shall see

1340
01:14:03,986 --> 01:14:12,994
some day from tears
I shall be free

1341
01:14:12,995 --> 01:14:15,997
for someday

1342
01:14:15,998 --> 01:14:24,505
I shall understand

1343
01:14:24,506 --> 01:14:26,507
I cannot tell

1344
01:14:26,508 --> 01:14:28,509
Oh, Susan, Susan.

1345
01:14:28,510 --> 01:14:32,013
The depth of love

1346
01:14:32,014 --> 01:14:38,519
we choose the father's
breast above

1347
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:41,522
my faith to test

1348
01:14:41,523 --> 01:14:46,527
my love to prove

1349
01:14:46,528 --> 01:14:55,136
but someday I'll understand

1350
01:14:55,137 --> 01:15:03,144
someday he'll
make it plain to me

1351
01:15:03,145 --> 01:15:10,651
someday when I
his face shall see

1352
01:15:10,652 --> 01:15:19,160
someday from tears
I shall be free

1353
01:15:19,161 --> 01:15:26,167
someday I shall

1354
01:15:26,168 --> 01:15:30,805
no longer stay

1355
01:15:32,307 --> 01:15:34,809
Are you sure you're up to this?

1356
01:15:34,810 --> 01:15:36,311
Sure.

1357
01:15:38,313 --> 01:15:39,313
Listen, do you know of anything

1358
01:15:39,314 --> 01:15:40,815
my parents might have done

1359
01:15:40,816 --> 01:15:43,818
to hurt the case Ascher
was putting together?

1360
01:15:43,819 --> 01:15:45,319
What do you mean?

1361
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:46,320
Like testimony?

1362
01:15:46,321 --> 01:15:48,823
Uh, evidence they
wouldn't let him use.

1363
01:15:48,824 --> 01:15:50,324
Who have you been
talking to now?

1364
01:15:50,325 --> 01:15:51,325
Fanny Ascher?

1365
01:15:51,326 --> 01:15:52,327
Yeah.
Of course.

1366
01:15:54,329 --> 01:15:57,331
You got to understand Fanny.

1367
01:15:57,332 --> 01:15:58,833
Jake was in poor health.

1368
01:15:58,834 --> 01:16:01,836
And she blames
his death on the case.

1369
01:16:01,837 --> 01:16:04,338
That means she blames
the Isaacsons.

1370
01:16:04,339 --> 01:16:06,841
Of course she's going
to resent any criticism

1371
01:16:06,842 --> 01:16:08,843
of the way he handled
the defense.

1372
01:16:08,844 --> 01:16:10,846
She wants you to take
over the practice.

1373
01:16:13,348 --> 01:16:16,350
My father and Jake
Ascher were law partners in the forties.

1374
01:16:16,351 --> 01:16:19,353
I was the heir apparent.

1375
01:16:19,354 --> 01:16:22,356
Fanny never forgave
me for wanting to teach law.

1376
01:16:22,357 --> 01:16:23,858
I don't remember Jake

1377
01:16:23,859 --> 01:16:26,293
ever saying anything
along those lines.

1378
01:16:26,294 --> 01:16:29,797
Of course I didn't
really get involved until the appeals.

1379
01:16:29,798 --> 01:16:31,799
Who knows?

1380
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:33,801
Her parents were party members.

1381
01:16:33,802 --> 01:16:36,303
Perhaps they felt
they had to handle their defense

1382
01:16:36,304 --> 01:16:38,806
with an eye out for the party.

1383
01:16:38,807 --> 01:16:40,808
Maybe there is something to it.

1384
01:16:40,809 --> 01:16:42,811
Maybe they did hold
back. I don't know.

1385
01:16:44,312 --> 01:16:48,315
If they did, the party didn't
show any gratitude, did it?

1386
01:16:48,316 --> 01:16:51,318
They were no help until
after the sentence.

1387
01:16:51,319 --> 01:16:56,457
The propaganda value
of the case was too good to be ignored.

1388
01:16:56,458 --> 01:16:58,959
In those days
it was fashionable

1389
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:01,462
to downgrade
Russian technology...

1390
01:17:01,463 --> 01:17:03,464
before sputnik.

1391
01:17:03,465 --> 01:17:04,965
The joke
was how they copied everything

1392
01:17:04,966 --> 01:17:06,967
and claimed it for their own.

1393
01:17:06,968 --> 01:17:08,969
So when they got the bomb,

1394
01:17:08,970 --> 01:17:10,471
it was our bomb.

1395
01:17:10,472 --> 01:17:11,473
That meant we were betrayed.

1396
01:17:13,442 --> 01:17:15,443
It's good, Lise.

1397
01:17:15,444 --> 01:17:16,944
Yeah, it's great.

1398
01:17:16,945 --> 01:17:18,446
If I'd had more notice,

1399
01:17:18,447 --> 01:17:20,448
I could have made
something special.

1400
01:17:20,449 --> 01:17:21,749
But we never hear from you.

1401
01:17:21,750 --> 01:17:23,250
We never know
when to expect you.

1402
01:17:23,251 --> 01:17:24,752
After the war,

1403
01:17:24,753 --> 01:17:27,755
we built our entire
foreign policy on a bomb,

1404
01:17:27,756 --> 01:17:28,756
on our having the bomb,

1405
01:17:28,757 --> 01:17:30,758
and the Soviets not having it.

1406
01:17:30,759 --> 01:17:33,260
Terrible mistake. It
militarized the world.

1407
01:17:33,261 --> 01:17:34,762
And when they got it,

1408
01:17:34,763 --> 01:17:37,765
the only alternative
to admitting our bankrupt policy

1409
01:17:37,766 --> 01:17:39,333
was to find conspiracies.

1410
01:17:39,334 --> 01:17:40,835
It was one or the other.

1411
01:17:40,836 --> 01:17:42,803
You stopped at Susan's?

1412
01:17:42,804 --> 01:17:44,805
I washed her hair this morning.

1413
01:17:44,806 --> 01:17:48,309
I bought her a lovely robe,
but it's too big.

1414
01:17:48,310 --> 01:17:49,778
I'll have to get
the smaller size.

1415
01:18:03,124 --> 01:18:05,626
You know, I...

1416
01:18:05,627 --> 01:18:09,631
Used to think
about the odds against it.

1417
01:18:12,467 --> 01:18:13,434
What?

1418
01:18:16,338 --> 01:18:18,839
That it would happen to us,

1419
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:20,341
you know?

1420
01:18:20,342 --> 01:18:22,843
That particular family...

1421
01:18:22,844 --> 01:18:24,812
Out of millions.

1422
01:18:28,250 --> 01:18:30,251
Well, if you're the FBI

1423
01:18:30,252 --> 01:18:33,821
and you know you
have to bring in something,

1424
01:18:33,822 --> 01:18:35,589
what do you do?

1425
01:18:35,590 --> 01:18:36,924
You go to your files.

1426
01:18:36,925 --> 01:18:40,828
You have a file
of known left-wing activists.

1427
01:18:40,829 --> 01:18:43,330
And if you find
somebody in there

1428
01:18:43,331 --> 01:18:46,367
who gives off
a sense of his own vulnerability,

1429
01:18:46,368 --> 01:18:48,870
you go to work on that.

1430
01:18:50,372 --> 01:18:52,706
Selig Mindish?

1431
01:18:52,707 --> 01:18:54,508
They questioned him for weeks

1432
01:18:54,509 --> 01:18:55,509
before they arrested him.

1433
01:18:55,510 --> 01:18:57,011
And they questioned
him for weeks

1434
01:18:57,012 --> 01:18:58,412
after they arrested him.

1435
01:18:58,413 --> 01:19:00,915
And Selig Mindish
became their case.

1436
01:19:00,916 --> 01:19:01,916
Robert, I wish we wouldn't
talk about this.

1437
01:19:01,917 --> 01:19:03,918
He became their case

1438
01:19:03,919 --> 01:19:05,553
because he named your parents.

1439
01:19:05,554 --> 01:19:07,054
And if they had
named other people,

1440
01:19:07,055 --> 01:19:09,223
they could have
become prosecution witnesses like Mindish.

1441
01:19:09,224 --> 01:19:11,292
But they didn't so they
became the defendant.

1442
01:19:11,293 --> 01:19:14,094
What is this family's
continuing desire for punishment?

1443
01:19:14,095 --> 01:19:15,696
Lise, the boy
is asking questions.

1444
01:19:15,697 --> 01:19:17,698
Yes, and I know what
this is going to lead to.

1445
01:19:17,699 --> 01:19:20,234
You're going to tell him how you
would have conducted the defense

1446
01:19:20,235 --> 01:19:23,203
with the Isaacsons
a dozen years now in their graves.

1447
01:19:23,204 --> 01:19:24,705
How comforting!

1448
01:19:24,706 --> 01:19:26,206
Mom.

1449
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:27,208
Mom.

1450
01:19:29,210 --> 01:19:32,580
Did I say I needed comfort?

1451
01:19:34,883 --> 01:19:36,383
Huh?

1452
01:19:36,384 --> 01:19:38,386
Did I ask for comfort?

1453
01:19:42,123 --> 01:19:43,624
Lisa.

1454
01:19:43,625 --> 01:19:45,125
You'll forgive me.

1455
01:19:45,126 --> 01:19:46,627
If you remember,

1456
01:19:46,628 --> 01:19:49,630
we never thought
it was a good idea

1457
01:19:49,631 --> 01:19:52,133
to discuss the case with Susan.

1458
01:19:55,770 --> 01:19:56,770
Today, Jake wouldn't have

1459
01:19:56,771 --> 01:19:59,273
the same problems
to contend with.

1460
01:19:59,274 --> 01:20:01,275
If they were on trial today,

1461
01:20:01,276 --> 01:20:03,677
the prosecution
couldn't pull this stuff in court.

1462
01:20:03,678 --> 01:20:05,631
If you admit this line
of questioning,

1463
01:20:05,632 --> 01:20:07,133
their political beliefs,

1464
01:20:07,134 --> 01:20:08,134
their political affiliations,

1465
01:20:08,135 --> 01:20:10,970
that is what
the trial will rest on.

1466
01:20:10,971 --> 01:20:11,971
Your honor, we simply
want to establish

1467
01:20:11,972 --> 01:20:13,706
motivation for what
they stand accused of.

1468
01:20:13,707 --> 01:20:15,207
The defense
counselor's concerned

1469
01:20:15,208 --> 01:20:18,878
that if his clients
are forced to answer questions

1470
01:20:18,879 --> 01:20:21,380
concerning their
political affiliations,

1471
01:20:21,381 --> 01:20:25,885
presumably the unpopularity
of these affiliations

1472
01:20:25,886 --> 01:20:29,689
would prejudice
the minds of the jury.

1473
01:20:29,690 --> 01:20:31,190
That's part of it, your
honor. I see nowhere...

1474
01:20:31,191 --> 01:20:32,692
If I may set precedent...

1475
01:20:32,693 --> 01:20:35,194
you can build a charge
that they belong to a political party.

1476
01:20:35,195 --> 01:20:37,196
If their politics
is to be answered for,

1477
01:20:37,197 --> 01:20:38,197
then why is it not written
in the indictment?

1478
01:20:38,198 --> 01:20:39,699
In U.S. versus
Schmidt, 1942,

1479
01:20:39,700 --> 01:20:42,201
the political
affiliation of the defendant

1480
01:20:42,202 --> 01:20:43,903
was admitted as
establishing motive.

1481
01:20:43,904 --> 01:20:46,405
People commit crimes
for reasons.

1482
01:20:46,406 --> 01:20:48,741
And sometimes
those reasons are political reasons.

1483
01:20:48,742 --> 01:20:52,178
That seems reasonable,
Mr. Ascher.

1484
01:20:52,179 --> 01:20:55,181
Pardon me. I don't see
the humor in this situation.

1485
01:20:55,182 --> 01:20:56,682
Schmidt was a Nazi.

1486
01:20:56,683 --> 01:20:59,185
He was indicted as a traitor.

1487
01:20:59,186 --> 01:21:01,687
Treason is defined
in the constitution

1488
01:21:01,688 --> 01:21:04,690
as levying war
against the United States

1489
01:21:04,691 --> 01:21:06,192
or adhering to its enemies

1490
01:21:06,193 --> 01:21:07,526
in time of war and giving
them aid and comfort.

1491
01:21:07,527 --> 01:21:08,527
I'm grateful
to Mr. Ascher

1492
01:21:08,528 --> 01:21:10,262
for keeping us up on things.

1493
01:21:10,263 --> 01:21:13,265
If you want to put my clients
on trial for treason,

1494
01:21:13,266 --> 01:21:14,767
that's fine for me.

1495
01:21:14,768 --> 01:21:17,269
Then the uncorroborated
testimony of one witness

1496
01:21:17,270 --> 01:21:19,271
will not be admitted
as evidence,

1497
01:21:19,272 --> 01:21:21,273
as it is under the present
conspiracy charge.

1498
01:21:21,274 --> 01:21:23,275
Then you will have to prove
that they did something,

1499
01:21:23,276 --> 01:21:24,777
as you do not now.

1500
01:21:24,778 --> 01:21:27,713
Mr. Ascher, you're not
really saying

1501
01:21:27,714 --> 01:21:30,316
that a Nazi's politics
should be in the record,

1502
01:21:30,317 --> 01:21:33,219
but a communist's should not?

1503
01:21:33,220 --> 01:21:34,720
These are momentous times.

1504
01:21:34,721 --> 01:21:38,224
We're not technically
at war with the reds,

1505
01:21:38,225 --> 01:21:40,726
but we are at war.

1506
01:21:40,727 --> 01:21:44,130
Wouldn't you agree,
Mr. Ascher?

1507
01:21:44,131 --> 01:21:47,233
I'm going to go ahead and
rule for the prosecution

1508
01:21:47,234 --> 01:21:50,770
on the grounds that
the politics of your clients

1509
01:21:50,771 --> 01:21:54,240
are crucial
to the argument of this trial.

1510
01:21:54,241 --> 01:21:57,443
Over my strenuous
objections, your honor.

1511
01:21:57,444 --> 01:21:58,778
Noted.

1512
01:21:58,779 --> 01:22:02,281
You continue to try
my clients under one law

1513
01:22:02,282 --> 01:22:04,784
as if they had broken another.

1514
01:22:04,785 --> 01:22:06,285
Poor old Jake.

1515
01:22:06,286 --> 01:22:08,788
What he was up against.

1516
01:22:08,789 --> 01:22:12,191
The whole temper
of the times was medieval.

1517
01:22:12,192 --> 01:22:16,162
Selig Mindish needed
no one else to commit his crime.

1518
01:22:16,163 --> 01:22:17,663
The dentist

1519
01:22:17,664 --> 01:22:21,133
working in the darkness
of his dental laboratory

1520
01:22:21,134 --> 01:22:24,136
to steal the formula
for atomic fission,

1521
01:22:24,137 --> 01:22:26,639
there is your spy!

1522
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:29,642
"Selig Mindish, ladies
and gentlemen of the jury,

1523
01:22:29,643 --> 01:22:31,343
"he is your spy!

1524
01:22:31,344 --> 01:22:33,846
He and he alone
is responsible."

1525
01:22:33,847 --> 01:22:36,348
God knows.
The pressure was enormous.

1526
01:22:36,349 --> 01:22:38,851
I couldn't have come up
with anything better myself.

1527
01:22:38,852 --> 01:22:40,352
Perhaps no one could.

1528
01:22:40,353 --> 01:22:41,854
I don't understand.

1529
01:22:41,855 --> 01:22:45,357
The strategy was
to turn everything back on Mindish,

1530
01:22:45,358 --> 01:22:49,361
to show him guiltier
than he himself confessed to being,

1531
01:22:49,362 --> 01:22:51,363
to... to show
his self-interest

1532
01:22:51,364 --> 01:22:53,365
in testifying
against the Isaacsons

1533
01:22:53,366 --> 01:22:54,867
to save himself.

1534
01:22:54,868 --> 01:22:56,368
He is your spy.

1535
01:22:56,369 --> 01:22:57,369
He and he alone.

1536
01:22:57,370 --> 01:22:58,370
What?

1537
01:22:58,371 --> 01:23:00,873
Don't you see
the terrible flaw?

1538
01:23:00,874 --> 01:23:05,044
It admits there was a crime.

1539
01:23:05,045 --> 01:23:07,480
Your parents and Ascher
gave the prosecution

1540
01:23:07,481 --> 01:23:08,981
the one premise
it shouldn't have...

1541
01:23:08,982 --> 01:23:10,549
that any crime
was committed at all.

1542
01:23:10,550 --> 01:23:12,051
But Mindish confessed.

1543
01:23:12,052 --> 01:23:14,487
Why would Mindish confess
if no crime was committed?

1544
01:23:14,488 --> 01:23:15,988
Why indeed?

1545
01:23:15,989 --> 01:23:18,991
I don't know how well
you remember Selig Mindish.

1546
01:23:18,992 --> 01:23:20,493
An ignorant man,

1547
01:23:20,494 --> 01:23:21,994
never properly naturalized,

1548
01:23:21,995 --> 01:23:24,997
a dubious degree from some
third-rate dental college.

1549
01:23:24,998 --> 01:23:27,700
A very ordinary man

1550
01:23:27,701 --> 01:23:30,503
perfectly capable of
joining the communist party

1551
01:23:30,504 --> 01:23:34,006
for no more than
an exalted sense of himself.

1552
01:23:34,007 --> 01:23:36,509
So you ask, what
is the motivation

1553
01:23:36,510 --> 01:23:38,577
for a man to do what he did?

1554
01:23:38,578 --> 01:23:41,580
Well, one motivation
is to believe,

1555
01:23:41,581 --> 01:23:44,350
or to have been
persuaded to believe,

1556
01:23:44,351 --> 01:23:46,619
in his own guilt

1557
01:23:46,620 --> 01:23:50,122
and to live in mortal fear
of the consequences.

1558
01:23:50,123 --> 01:23:51,857
Another is to believe,

1559
01:23:51,858 --> 01:23:53,859
or to have been
persuaded to believe,

1560
01:23:53,860 --> 01:23:56,295
in the guilt of his friends

1561
01:23:56,296 --> 01:23:59,798
and to live in mortal fear
of the consequences.

1562
01:23:59,799 --> 01:24:01,800
But there's
a third possibility.

1563
01:24:01,801 --> 01:24:05,804
Don't you remember
what their lives were like?

1564
01:24:05,805 --> 01:24:08,307
They believed.

1565
01:24:08,308 --> 01:24:10,309
They had the faith,

1566
01:24:10,310 --> 01:24:12,811
and they were prepared

1567
01:24:12,812 --> 01:24:16,115
to suffer the passion
of their faith.

1568
01:24:18,552 --> 01:24:23,556
We are the people's soldiers

1569
01:24:23,557 --> 01:24:27,893
we're marching
with our strengths

1570
01:24:27,894 --> 01:24:31,897
to beyond

1571
01:24:31,898 --> 01:24:36,769
far and wide
as the eye can wander

1572
01:24:36,770 --> 01:24:41,273
heathen folk are everywhere

1573
01:24:41,274 --> 01:24:45,778
not a bird sings out
to cheer us

1574
01:24:45,779 --> 01:24:50,816
folks are standing
gaunt and bare

1575
01:24:50,817 --> 01:24:51,817
That's Paul Robeson.

1576
01:24:51,818 --> 01:24:55,821
We are the people's soldiers

1577
01:24:55,822 --> 01:24:57,423
we're marching with...

1578
01:25:47,173 --> 01:25:49,675
This isn't the way we came.

1579
01:26:35,588 --> 01:26:37,423
Commie cocksuckers!

1580
01:26:42,595 --> 01:26:45,097
Jew bastards!

1581
01:26:45,098 --> 01:26:46,365
Are you crazy?!

1582
01:26:46,366 --> 01:26:48,100
Officer!

1583
01:26:48,101 --> 01:26:49,435
Paul!

1584
01:26:49,436 --> 01:26:50,803
You dirty rats!
Officer!

1585
01:26:50,804 --> 01:26:52,037
Paulie!

1586
01:26:52,038 --> 01:26:53,939
Get down!

1587
01:26:53,940 --> 01:26:55,574
What are you doing?!

1588
01:26:55,575 --> 01:26:57,243
This must not be permitted!

1589
01:27:00,613 --> 01:27:03,449
Open the door!
Open the door!

1590
01:27:06,619 --> 01:27:08,954
Paul!

1591
01:27:11,224 --> 01:27:12,725
Aah!

1592
01:27:12,726 --> 01:27:15,794
Stop them before
they break him in half!

1593
01:27:15,795 --> 01:27:18,063
Commie rats!

1594
01:27:18,064 --> 01:27:19,465
You dirty rats!

1595
01:27:21,801 --> 01:27:23,469
You commie bastards!

1596
01:27:31,277 --> 01:27:34,279
Burning at the stake.

1597
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:35,781
Known to all European nations

1598
01:27:35,782 --> 01:27:37,783
through the 19th century.

1599
01:27:37,784 --> 01:27:40,753
Used into the 20th century.

1600
01:27:40,754 --> 01:27:43,255
Always, in whatever country,

1601
01:27:43,256 --> 01:27:45,524
used on the lower classes.

1602
01:27:45,525 --> 01:27:49,028
Like the knout,
like drawing and quartering

1603
01:27:50,530 --> 01:27:53,533
no accident Joan
of arc was a peasant.

1604
01:27:56,936 --> 01:27:59,438
Is this the right day?

1605
01:27:59,439 --> 01:28:02,441
Yes, Daniel.

1606
01:28:02,442 --> 01:28:05,444
Do they know I'm coming?

1607
01:28:05,445 --> 01:28:07,446
I told you, yes.

1608
01:28:07,447 --> 01:28:09,449
They're dead.

1609
01:28:11,451 --> 01:28:14,453
No...

1610
01:28:14,454 --> 01:28:15,955
My little girl...

1611
01:28:16,956 --> 01:28:20,459
That is not true.

1612
01:28:20,460 --> 01:28:22,461
They are alive.

1613
01:28:22,462 --> 01:28:24,463
Not anymore.
They were killed.

1614
01:28:24,464 --> 01:28:26,465
It was in the newspaper.

1615
01:28:26,466 --> 01:28:28,467
How do you know?
You can't read.

1616
01:28:28,468 --> 01:28:30,970
I can.
I've learned how to read.

1617
01:29:02,235 --> 01:29:05,237
You sure they want to see us?

1618
01:29:05,238 --> 01:29:07,240
More than anything.

1619
01:29:19,252 --> 01:29:21,753
Mr. Ascher, any word
on the appeals?

1620
01:29:21,754 --> 01:29:24,256
Son, how long has it been
since you've seen your parents?

1621
01:29:24,257 --> 01:29:25,124
One more thing,
Mr. Ascher.

1622
01:29:30,964 --> 01:29:33,465
Everyone knows they're dead.

1623
01:29:33,466 --> 01:29:35,467
Who's everyone?

1624
01:29:35,468 --> 01:29:37,469
My class.

1625
01:29:37,470 --> 01:29:39,305
You're a dope.

1626
01:30:11,905 --> 01:30:13,906
What's this?

1627
01:30:13,907 --> 01:30:14,807
He has to frisk me.

1628
01:30:15,808 --> 01:30:17,176
That's ok, kid.

1629
01:30:18,177 --> 01:30:19,177
No, go ahead and search me.

1630
01:30:19,178 --> 01:30:20,179
I might have a gun.

1631
01:30:22,115 --> 01:30:24,182
That's ok. I'm satisfied
you don't have a gun.

1632
01:30:24,183 --> 01:30:28,186
They haven't
seen their parents in over a year.

1633
01:30:28,187 --> 01:30:30,789
Yeah?
Well, they're here.

1634
01:30:30,790 --> 01:30:32,258
Search me.

1635
01:30:39,032 --> 01:30:40,299
Now her.

1636
01:31:23,910 --> 01:31:26,912
Look at you.
Look at you.

1637
01:31:26,913 --> 01:31:31,416
You're so big
I don't even recognize you.

1638
01:31:31,417 --> 01:31:32,918
We sent you pictures.

1639
01:31:32,919 --> 01:31:34,921
It's not the same.

1640
01:31:36,923 --> 01:31:39,859
Well, aren't you going
to give me a hug?

1641
01:31:45,865 --> 01:31:47,867
You're so big.

1642
01:31:49,869 --> 01:31:52,371
You're so beautiful.

1643
01:31:54,941 --> 01:31:57,943
You're my beautiful children.

1644
01:31:57,944 --> 01:31:59,779
When are they
going to kill you?

1645
01:32:03,282 --> 01:32:06,518
My darling, they're
not going to do that.

1646
01:32:06,519 --> 01:32:09,521
That's just
their way of talking.

1647
01:32:09,522 --> 01:32:12,524
I'm sure Uncle Jake
told you about appeals,

1648
01:32:12,525 --> 01:32:16,528
about the lawyers who
have to examine the trials.

1649
01:32:16,529 --> 01:32:18,030
That takes time.

1650
01:32:18,031 --> 01:32:20,032
We're in no danger right now.

1651
01:32:20,033 --> 01:32:23,036
But what if they kill you
anyway, how will they do it?

1652
01:32:26,472 --> 01:32:28,974
Well, darling, they do
something called electrocution,

1653
01:32:28,975 --> 01:32:30,709
and it's very painless.

1654
01:32:30,710 --> 01:32:33,211
We don't want
to talk about that.

1655
01:32:33,212 --> 01:32:36,481
Aren't you warm?
Take off your coat.

1656
01:32:36,482 --> 01:32:37,482
Let me have a look at you.

1657
01:32:37,483 --> 01:32:38,984
You're very nicely dressed.

1658
01:32:40,486 --> 01:32:42,488
How lovely you look.

1659
01:32:46,492 --> 01:32:48,994
Here. I have
a little surprise.

1660
01:33:01,974 --> 01:33:03,909
And how's school?

1661
01:33:06,913 --> 01:33:08,914
Fine.

1662
01:33:08,915 --> 01:33:10,415
I'm going to be a lawyer.

1663
01:33:10,416 --> 01:33:12,851
Then I can get you free.

1664
01:33:12,852 --> 01:33:15,854
This I haven't heard before.

1665
01:33:15,855 --> 01:33:18,691
He's going to make
a good lawyer, won't he, Jake?

1666
01:33:21,694 --> 01:33:24,196
I won't let them kill you.

1667
01:33:24,197 --> 01:33:26,164
I'll kill them first.

1668
01:33:26,165 --> 01:33:28,667
Oh, now, where did you
get that expression?

1669
01:33:30,136 --> 01:33:31,703
Where's my daddy?

1670
01:33:31,704 --> 01:33:34,206
First I get to visit with you,

1671
01:33:34,207 --> 01:33:36,174
and then he gets his turn.

1672
01:33:36,175 --> 01:33:37,676
Why not together?

1673
01:33:37,677 --> 01:33:40,879
Look how long your hair
has gotten. It's so pretty.

1674
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:42,881
Do you see my daddy?

1675
01:33:42,882 --> 01:33:46,718
Yes. We get to talk once
a week through a screen.

1676
01:33:46,719 --> 01:33:50,222
We went home,

1677
01:33:50,223 --> 01:33:52,225
but it was gone.

1678
01:34:06,973 --> 01:34:10,843
It's hard to make up for all
the lost time, isn't it?

1679
01:34:14,180 --> 01:34:16,649
It's a strange feeling,
isn't it?

1680
01:34:21,053 --> 01:34:22,888
We're living with a family.

1681
01:34:22,889 --> 01:34:25,056
I know.

1682
01:34:25,057 --> 01:34:27,859
It's closer to here
than the shelter.

1683
01:34:27,860 --> 01:34:30,095
I know...

1684
01:34:33,966 --> 01:34:36,420
The judge made us.

1685
01:34:36,421 --> 01:34:38,422
Look, Danny,
you don't understand.

1686
01:34:38,423 --> 01:34:41,425
I chose the Lewins
from all the people.

1687
01:34:41,426 --> 01:34:43,427
I wanted that for you.

1688
01:34:43,428 --> 01:34:46,430
It's going to be some time
before this is over,

1689
01:34:46,431 --> 01:34:49,934
and it's too long
to stay in the shelter.

1690
01:34:53,471 --> 01:34:54,972
Already?

1691
01:34:54,973 --> 01:34:57,475
You'll come back
soon, won't you?

1692
01:35:01,980 --> 01:35:03,982
I love you, my sweetest angels.

1693
01:35:06,985 --> 01:35:09,987
I love your pictures,
I love your letters.

1694
01:35:09,988 --> 01:35:12,990
I'm so proud of you,
you know that?

1695
01:35:12,991 --> 01:35:14,992
But soon this will all be over,

1696
01:35:14,993 --> 01:35:16,994
and we'll have peace again.

1697
01:35:16,995 --> 01:35:19,997
It's a terrible thing
to do to people, isn't it?

1698
01:35:19,998 --> 01:35:21,999
But don't you worry,

1699
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,501
we'll get out of here.

1700
01:35:24,502 --> 01:35:26,504
We'll have fun again.

1701
01:35:47,992 --> 01:35:52,996
How are the two best
children in the world?

1702
01:35:52,997 --> 01:35:57,000
How are my favorite children?

1703
01:35:57,001 --> 01:35:59,003
Oh, look at them, Jake.

1704
01:36:00,505 --> 01:36:04,007
A million dollars!

1705
01:36:04,008 --> 01:36:07,010
A million dollars!

1706
01:36:07,011 --> 01:36:09,513
You know what I got here?

1707
01:36:09,514 --> 01:36:10,515
Do you?

1708
01:36:13,518 --> 01:36:16,019
I'm going to show you.

1709
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:17,521
Watch carefully.

1710
01:36:19,524 --> 01:36:21,025
Bug collection.

1711
01:36:23,528 --> 01:36:25,529
How did you catch them?

1712
01:36:25,530 --> 01:36:27,531
Paper cup. I can't keep
them from drying out.

1713
01:36:27,532 --> 01:36:30,033
And they won't let me
have preservatives.

1714
01:36:30,034 --> 01:36:32,035
But the insect world
is truly amazing.

1715
01:36:32,036 --> 01:36:34,037
Come here.
Look at this moth.

1716
01:36:34,038 --> 01:36:35,539
Isn't that beautiful?

1717
01:36:35,540 --> 01:36:37,040
Aw, come here.

1718
01:36:37,041 --> 01:36:38,542
Isn't it beautiful?

1719
01:36:38,543 --> 01:36:40,043
I hate...
I hate them things.

1720
01:36:40,044 --> 01:36:42,045
These are roaches.

1721
01:36:42,046 --> 01:36:43,547
I can usually find
all the specimens I need,

1722
01:36:43,548 --> 01:36:45,549
but you got to trick them.

1723
01:36:45,550 --> 01:36:47,552
Sometimes it takes hours.

1724
01:36:48,553 --> 01:36:49,554
Uh...

1725
01:36:52,557 --> 01:36:55,058
You know, I figured it out...

1726
01:36:55,059 --> 01:36:56,560
I'm not more than 20 feet

1727
01:36:56,561 --> 01:36:58,061
from your mother
as the crow flies.

1728
01:36:58,062 --> 01:37:00,063
I'm one floor below
and I'm one block over.

1729
01:37:00,064 --> 01:37:02,566
Of course, there's a lot
of stone between us,

1730
01:37:02,567 --> 01:37:04,001
and poor mommy's
all alone up there.

1731
01:37:04,002 --> 01:37:05,002
She's the only woman.

1732
01:37:05,003 --> 01:37:07,004
I, at least, have
murderers to talk to.

1733
01:37:07,005 --> 01:37:09,007
You still a baseball fan?

1734
01:37:10,508 --> 01:37:13,510
You know, they put
the giants game

1735
01:37:13,511 --> 01:37:17,014
over the, uh...
Over the loudspeakers.

1736
01:37:17,015 --> 01:37:20,017
They'll make a fan of me yet.

1737
01:37:20,018 --> 01:37:22,519
Also, I play chess
with the other inmates.

1738
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:23,520
We put the, uh...

1739
01:37:23,521 --> 01:37:25,522
We make our boards and
our chessmen out of paper.

1740
01:37:25,523 --> 01:37:27,024
And then we shout the moves.

1741
01:37:27,025 --> 01:37:30,527
I always thought chess
was a waste of time.

1742
01:37:30,528 --> 01:37:31,528
And it is. It's
a terrible waste of time.

1743
01:37:31,529 --> 01:37:33,030
Time. It's valuable.

1744
01:37:33,031 --> 01:37:35,032
Now, you can put innocent...

1745
01:37:35,033 --> 01:37:36,533
you can put
innocent people to jail,

1746
01:37:36,534 --> 01:37:38,035
but you can't put
their minds in jail.

1747
01:37:38,036 --> 01:37:39,536
You understand?
What's wrong? I burn you?

1748
01:37:39,537 --> 01:37:42,539
Look here. It didn't fall.
The Ash is still here, you see?

1749
01:37:42,540 --> 01:37:44,041
Don't worry. I wouldn't
hurt my boy.

1750
01:37:44,042 --> 01:37:47,044
They are the ones
with the minds in jail.

1751
01:37:47,045 --> 01:37:49,046
But you can't put
innocent people to death

1752
01:37:49,047 --> 01:37:51,048
in this country
because it can't be done.

1753
01:37:51,049 --> 01:37:53,050
You'll see. Public opinion
will get behind us.

1754
01:37:53,051 --> 01:37:54,551
You'll see, my handsome boy.

1755
01:37:54,552 --> 01:37:56,053
Am I right, Jake? Huh?

1756
01:37:56,054 --> 01:37:57,554
Of course.

1757
01:37:57,555 --> 01:37:59,556
No, wait, no! Before
our trial even started,

1758
01:37:59,557 --> 01:38:02,559
we were convicted
by the paid hirelings of the kept press.

1759
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:05,062
And it was not
a fair trial on that ground alone.

1760
01:38:05,063 --> 01:38:06,063
Paul, I don't think now...

1761
01:38:06,064 --> 01:38:08,565
no! You listen!
You be quiet!

1762
01:38:08,566 --> 01:38:10,067
It's all right, it's all right.

1763
01:38:10,068 --> 01:38:12,069
I want my son to know

1764
01:38:12,070 --> 01:38:13,070
we're not alone, the Isaacsons.

1765
01:38:13,071 --> 01:38:15,572
Soon, the whole world
is going to be behind us

1766
01:38:15,573 --> 01:38:17,574
in our fight
to regain our freedom.

1767
01:38:17,575 --> 01:38:18,575
And he can help.

1768
01:38:18,576 --> 01:38:20,077
And you want to help,
don't you? Huh?

1769
01:38:20,078 --> 01:38:21,078
Yeah.

1770
01:38:21,079 --> 01:38:22,079
That's right!

1771
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:24,081
Oh, you, you!

1772
01:38:24,082 --> 01:38:27,084
You know, you are
my brilliant boy.

1773
01:38:27,085 --> 01:38:30,587
You are my wonderful,
brilliant boy.

1774
01:38:30,588 --> 01:38:33,090
You know, you're getting
to look like me.

1775
01:38:33,091 --> 01:38:34,091
Am I?

1776
01:38:34,092 --> 01:38:37,094
You, ah...
You're luckier.

1777
01:38:37,095 --> 01:38:39,596
You're the image
of your mother.

1778
01:38:39,597 --> 01:38:42,599
You're a beauty
just like your mom.

1779
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:47,104
Jake, isn't that
an ideal situation, huh?

1780
01:38:47,105 --> 01:38:49,106
What could a father ask for...

1781
01:38:49,107 --> 01:38:50,607
his son take after him,

1782
01:38:50,608 --> 01:38:52,609
and his daughter
after his wife.

1783
01:38:52,610 --> 01:38:53,677
Is that not ideal?

1784
01:38:53,678 --> 01:38:55,245
Absolutely.

1785
01:38:55,246 --> 01:38:56,747
We have an ideal family.

1786
01:38:59,817 --> 01:39:01,318
Now my soul is a witness

1787
01:39:01,319 --> 01:39:02,319
for my lord

1788
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:03,820
yes, my soul is a witness

1789
01:39:03,821 --> 01:39:04,821
for my lord

1790
01:39:04,822 --> 01:39:06,323
now my soul is a witness

1791
01:39:06,324 --> 01:39:07,324
for my lord

1792
01:39:07,325 --> 01:39:08,325
yes, my soul is a witness

1793
01:39:08,326 --> 01:39:09,826
for my lord

1794
01:39:09,827 --> 01:39:11,762
now Daniel was a Hebrew child

1795
01:39:11,763 --> 01:39:13,764
he went to pray
to his God for a while

1796
01:39:13,765 --> 01:39:16,266
king at once
for Daniel did send

1797
01:39:16,267 --> 01:39:22,773
cast him into the lion's den

1798
01:39:22,774 --> 01:39:26,576
the lord sent an angel

1799
01:39:26,577 --> 01:39:31,081
the lion's but a king

1800
01:39:31,082 --> 01:39:36,086
and Daniel lay down

1801
01:39:36,087 --> 01:39:44,528
and went to sleep

1802
01:39:44,529 --> 01:39:46,029
Daniel was a witness

1803
01:39:46,030 --> 01:39:47,030
for my lord

1804
01:39:47,031 --> 01:39:48,031
yes, Daniel was a witness

1805
01:39:48,032 --> 01:39:49,032
for my lord

1806
01:39:49,033 --> 01:39:50,534
oh, Daniel was a witness

1807
01:39:50,535 --> 01:39:51,535
for my lord

1808
01:39:51,536 --> 01:39:53,036
yes, Daniel was a witness

1809
01:39:53,037 --> 01:39:54,037
for my lord

1810
01:39:54,038 --> 01:39:55,539
now who will be a witness

1811
01:39:55,540 --> 01:39:56,540
for my lord

1812
01:39:56,541 --> 01:39:57,541
yes, who will be a witness

1813
01:39:57,542 --> 01:39:58,542
for my lord

1814
01:39:58,543 --> 01:40:00,043
now who will be a witness

1815
01:40:00,044 --> 01:40:04,247
for my lord

1816
01:40:04,248 --> 01:40:07,751
who will be a witness

1817
01:40:07,752 --> 01:40:16,093
for my lord

1818
01:40:20,097 --> 01:40:21,598
Hi, Linda.

1819
01:40:21,599 --> 01:40:24,101
Mr...

1820
01:40:26,103 --> 01:40:28,104
Come on, Linda.

1821
01:40:28,105 --> 01:40:31,608
It's me.
Danny Isaacson.

1822
01:40:31,609 --> 01:40:33,110
Weeks Avenue?

1823
01:40:38,115 --> 01:40:43,620
Jeez. Linda Meentan?

1824
01:40:43,621 --> 01:40:45,623
This is very nice.

1825
01:40:51,629 --> 01:40:54,130
I bet you're a very
good dentist, Linda.

1826
01:40:54,131 --> 01:40:55,632
You always had strong hands.

1827
01:40:56,634 --> 01:40:59,636
I can still feel
those pokes in the ribs.

1828
01:40:59,637 --> 01:41:03,640
You know, and you were good
at bending back fingers, too.

1829
01:41:03,641 --> 01:41:04,641
Sand in the eyes.

1830
01:41:04,642 --> 01:41:06,143
What do you want?

1831
01:41:07,144 --> 01:41:08,645
Hmm?

1832
01:41:08,646 --> 01:41:10,648
What are you doing here?

1833
01:41:12,149 --> 01:41:13,550
Oh, I... I happened
to be in the neighborhood.

1834
01:41:23,728 --> 01:41:27,230
Danny, I, uh, I'd like
you to meet Dale.

1835
01:41:27,231 --> 01:41:28,532
He's a lawyer.

1836
01:41:29,534 --> 01:41:31,035
What can we do for you?

1837
01:41:33,738 --> 01:41:34,738
Pretty good.

1838
01:41:34,739 --> 01:41:36,239
Linda did the right thing.

1839
01:41:36,240 --> 01:41:38,241
You can't barge in
on people like this

1840
01:41:38,242 --> 01:41:40,243
and expect them to put
out the welcome mat.

1841
01:41:40,244 --> 01:41:42,245
She has no way of
even knowing you are who you say you are.

1842
01:41:42,246 --> 01:41:44,247
Oh, no, no, no, no.
That's him.

1843
01:41:44,248 --> 01:41:46,249
That's Danny Isaacson.

1844
01:41:46,250 --> 01:41:47,250
Linda's a big girl,

1845
01:41:47,251 --> 01:41:48,752
and I can only
advise her what to do.

1846
01:41:48,753 --> 01:41:50,754
She and her family
have nothing to fear.

1847
01:41:50,755 --> 01:41:53,223
They are not obliged
to discuss that case or see you at all.

1848
01:41:53,224 --> 01:41:54,724
Do you need money?
What's your problem?

1849
01:41:54,725 --> 01:41:56,426
Dale, why don't you shut
up a fuckin' minute?

1850
01:41:56,427 --> 01:41:57,928
I want to warn you,

1851
01:41:57,929 --> 01:42:00,564
as a lawyer, an intimidation,

1852
01:42:00,565 --> 01:42:03,567
threatened or implied,
obscene language or slander,

1853
01:42:03,568 --> 01:42:04,068
in the State of California.

1854
01:42:06,771 --> 01:42:09,673
Uh, I'm hoping
your father can help settle some questions.

1855
01:42:09,674 --> 01:42:13,244
As far as I know, all the questions
were settled a long time ago.

1856
01:42:14,745 --> 01:42:16,880
Do you... do you want
me to talk in front of this guy?

1857
01:42:16,881 --> 01:42:19,883
This guy and I
are going to be married.

1858
01:42:19,884 --> 01:42:21,385
Um...

1859
01:42:22,753 --> 01:42:23,753
I'm interested to know

1860
01:42:23,754 --> 01:42:24,754
how you and your mother
supported yourselves

1861
01:42:24,755 --> 01:42:25,755
after your father went to jail.

1862
01:42:25,756 --> 01:42:27,223
It's none of his business.

1863
01:42:27,224 --> 01:42:28,558
You were 14 or 15,

1864
01:42:28,559 --> 01:42:30,360
but when you moved here,

1865
01:42:30,361 --> 01:42:32,295
you went to college
and dental school.

1866
01:42:32,296 --> 01:42:33,296
Linda, you're not obliged...

1867
01:42:33,297 --> 01:42:34,798
it's all right, sweetheart.

1868
01:42:36,300 --> 01:42:37,801
When, uh...

1869
01:42:37,802 --> 01:42:41,304
When my father went to prison,

1870
01:42:41,305 --> 01:42:43,807
my mother and I
suffered terribly.

1871
01:42:43,808 --> 01:42:46,309
But something good
happened, too.

1872
01:42:46,310 --> 01:42:48,812
You see, I discovered
resources in myself

1873
01:42:48,813 --> 01:42:50,814
I otherwise might not have.

1874
01:42:50,815 --> 01:42:52,315
And from what I understand,

1875
01:42:52,316 --> 01:42:55,652
neither you nor your sister
have been that fortunate.

1876
01:42:55,653 --> 01:42:57,621
In many ways,

1877
01:42:57,622 --> 01:43:00,290
it's been tougher
for me than for you.

1878
01:43:00,291 --> 01:43:03,927
I mean, your parents, after all, were
considered heroes in some circles.

1879
01:43:03,928 --> 01:43:07,430
But Selig Mindish,
he was a hero to no one.

1880
01:43:07,431 --> 01:43:09,433
To say the least.

1881
01:43:10,935 --> 01:43:13,003
We, uh...

1882
01:43:13,004 --> 01:43:14,838
We lost our friends,

1883
01:43:14,839 --> 01:43:17,607
and we lost our honor.

1884
01:43:17,608 --> 01:43:21,111
And the years he spent in jail
ruined his health.

1885
01:43:23,114 --> 01:43:25,115
I'll tell you something.

1886
01:43:25,116 --> 01:43:27,617
I often dreamed that
if we could change places,

1887
01:43:27,618 --> 01:43:29,619
the Isaacsons
and the Mindishes,

1888
01:43:29,620 --> 01:43:32,122
I'd be glad to stand
in your shoes,

1889
01:43:32,123 --> 01:43:34,624
just so you could
stand in mine.

1890
01:43:34,625 --> 01:43:35,926
Could I please
have your hankie, Dale?

1891
01:43:37,695 --> 01:43:39,696
Well, it's a nice
thought, Linda.

1892
01:43:39,697 --> 01:43:41,097
It's a nice thought.

1893
01:43:41,098 --> 01:43:43,633
A nice thought! You know,
I owe you nothing!

1894
01:43:43,634 --> 01:43:45,635
Your parents were
full of high ideas,

1895
01:43:45,636 --> 01:43:47,270
except when it came
to other people!

1896
01:43:47,271 --> 01:43:49,105
Except when it came to ruining
the lives of friends!

1897
01:43:49,106 --> 01:43:50,540
What does that mean?
What does that mean?

1898
01:43:50,541 --> 01:43:52,542
They led my father down
the garden path.

1899
01:43:52,543 --> 01:43:54,544
He chauffeured them
where they wanted to go,

1900
01:43:54,545 --> 01:43:56,046
he fixed teeth for them,

1901
01:43:56,047 --> 01:43:59,549
he... he turned
into a spy for them.

1902
01:43:59,550 --> 01:44:00,550
Linda, honey, calm yourself.

1903
01:44:00,551 --> 01:44:02,385
Well, Linda, the awful
Isaacsons are dead. They're dead!

1904
01:44:02,386 --> 01:44:04,654
Now all you have to
worry about is me.

1905
01:44:04,655 --> 01:44:07,357
But what can
I do? Tell people your real name?

1906
01:44:07,358 --> 01:44:10,794
No, this is...
this is Southern California.

1907
01:44:10,795 --> 01:44:12,796
This is orange
county. I mean,

1908
01:44:12,797 --> 01:44:15,799
after all, Selig helped
bust a commie spy ring.

1909
01:44:15,800 --> 01:44:17,300
His testimony is
a matter of record.

1910
01:44:17,301 --> 01:44:18,802
Yeah, it is, it is,

1911
01:44:18,803 --> 01:44:20,303
but things that
seemed clear then aren't clear now.

1912
01:44:20,304 --> 01:44:21,805
For instance,
you ever ask him why he testified?

1913
01:44:21,806 --> 01:44:23,373
Why... why he confessed?

1914
01:44:23,374 --> 01:44:25,375
That's a naive question.

1915
01:44:25,376 --> 01:44:28,845
Why? Why? Why?
'Cause he was... 'cause he was caught?

1916
01:44:28,846 --> 01:44:32,348
He had no choice? Or
because he was sorry for what he had done

1917
01:44:32,349 --> 01:44:35,385
or... or because he wanted
to save himself?

1918
01:44:35,386 --> 01:44:37,854
That's what
Jake Ascher thought.

1919
01:44:37,855 --> 01:44:42,358
That Selig fingered my
parents to save himself.

1920
01:44:42,359 --> 01:44:45,161
As for my parents,
I don't know what they thought.

1921
01:44:45,162 --> 01:44:47,664
Robert Lewin thinks it
was an act of sacrifice.

1922
01:44:47,665 --> 01:44:49,866
What are you talking about?

1923
01:44:49,867 --> 01:44:51,367
Nobody knows what happened!

1924
01:44:51,368 --> 01:44:54,370
Nobody knows what
really happened!

1925
01:44:54,371 --> 01:44:56,372
Even the government!

1926
01:44:56,373 --> 01:44:57,874
They were never satisfied.

1927
01:44:57,875 --> 01:44:59,876
They had the...
the criminal masterminds

1928
01:44:59,877 --> 01:45:02,879
they've gotten
the death sentence for.

1929
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:05,882
I mean, right up to the end,
they were ready to deal.

1930
01:45:05,883 --> 01:45:09,385
They only arrested my mother
to get my father to talk,

1931
01:45:09,386 --> 01:45:11,888
to try to break my father.

1932
01:45:13,390 --> 01:45:15,892
You know, they had this...
this little phone...

1933
01:45:15,893 --> 01:45:17,393
In the death chamber...

1934
01:45:17,394 --> 01:45:19,395
In case he wanted to confess.

1935
01:45:19,396 --> 01:45:21,397
Confess to what? Didn't
they already have him?

1936
01:45:21,398 --> 01:45:24,400
I mean, they... they sat
him down in the chair,

1937
01:45:24,401 --> 01:45:26,402
in the electric chair,

1938
01:45:26,403 --> 01:45:27,904
right?

1939
01:45:27,905 --> 01:45:29,406
Where he could see
the fuckin' phone...

1940
01:45:30,908 --> 01:45:32,909
And they were ready
to commute the sentence

1941
01:45:32,910 --> 01:45:36,914
if he told them
who really ran the atomic spy ring.

1942
01:45:42,553 --> 01:45:44,554
You know, there
was this other couple

1943
01:45:44,555 --> 01:45:46,055
that lived, uh, in the Bronx.

1944
01:45:46,056 --> 01:45:48,057
They belonged to
the Bronx membership.

1945
01:45:48,058 --> 01:45:52,562
And everyone believed they'd gone
underground to do dangerous work.

1946
01:45:52,563 --> 01:45:55,064
Even I heard that.
Did your... did your dad ever mention them?

1947
01:45:55,065 --> 01:45:56,065
Did he ever mention them?

1948
01:45:56,066 --> 01:45:57,400
Their name or
anything like that?

1949
01:45:57,401 --> 01:45:59,302
No, Danny.

1950
01:45:59,303 --> 01:46:01,805
No one did. No one ever
mentioned their name...

1951
01:46:01,806 --> 01:46:03,807
Without lowering their voices.

1952
01:46:03,808 --> 01:46:05,809
The daredevil heroes
of the Bronx.

1953
01:46:05,810 --> 01:46:08,311
I mean, after all, the
party was falling apart.

1954
01:46:08,312 --> 01:46:10,314
People needed to feel
good about something.

1955
01:46:12,316 --> 01:46:14,818
And, you know,
this other couple...

1956
01:46:14,819 --> 01:46:17,754
They were supposed to have
lived a few blocks from us.

1957
01:46:17,755 --> 01:46:19,656
And they were
supposed to have had two children.

1958
01:46:19,657 --> 01:46:21,524
You poor tormented boy.

1959
01:46:21,525 --> 01:46:25,328
Yeah, well, it's hard
to get it down. I know.

1960
01:46:25,329 --> 01:46:26,830
I'm not sure I understand.

1961
01:46:26,831 --> 01:46:29,332
Of course you
have no proof of this.

1962
01:46:29,333 --> 01:46:31,034
Of course, and that's
why I want to see Selig.

1963
01:46:31,035 --> 01:46:32,335
You stop calling
my father Selig.

1964
01:46:32,336 --> 01:46:35,004
I've got his fillings
in my teeth!

1965
01:46:35,005 --> 01:46:36,706
Let me... let me see
if I understand.

1966
01:46:36,707 --> 01:46:38,274
Oh, Dale, it's insane.

1967
01:46:38,275 --> 01:46:41,277
You're saying that Dr. Mindish
lied about your parents

1968
01:46:41,278 --> 01:46:44,547
in deference to another couple
who looked like them?

1969
01:46:44,548 --> 01:46:46,549
No, I don't know
if they looked like them.

1970
01:46:46,550 --> 01:46:50,053
No, I mean... I mean,
to protect another couple,

1971
01:46:50,054 --> 01:46:54,057
that everyone thought when
undercover to do dangerous work.

1972
01:46:54,058 --> 01:46:57,060
Uh... To keep the FBI away
from people of real value.

1973
01:46:57,061 --> 01:46:59,128
They were closing in
to get the heat off.

1974
01:46:59,129 --> 01:47:00,630
And that this mythical couple,

1975
01:47:00,631 --> 01:47:02,632
these other people.

1976
01:47:02,633 --> 01:47:04,901
Are the ones
who actually stole the secrets?

1977
01:47:04,902 --> 01:47:06,903
Well, not necessarily.

1978
01:47:06,904 --> 01:47:08,404
You know,
it's never been proven.

1979
01:47:08,405 --> 01:47:10,907
It's never been proven
that any secrets were stolen.

1980
01:47:10,908 --> 01:47:14,911
It's not what happened
or was going to happen.

1981
01:47:14,912 --> 01:47:19,415
It is what Selig and/or some of
the others thought had happened!

1982
01:47:19,416 --> 01:47:21,417
I mean, it... it was
as much fantasy

1983
01:47:21,418 --> 01:47:24,420
as what the, uh,
FBI thought had happened!

1984
01:47:24,421 --> 01:47:27,424
And your parents
lent themselves to this deception?

1985
01:47:31,428 --> 01:47:32,429
Uh...

1986
01:47:38,435 --> 01:47:40,937
My father...

1987
01:47:40,938 --> 01:47:42,939
Yeah, I think he would
have figured it out...

1988
01:47:42,940 --> 01:47:44,941
And gambled.

1989
01:47:44,942 --> 01:47:47,944
I don't think my mother would
have known anything about it.

1990
01:47:47,945 --> 01:47:48,879
You know...

1991
01:47:50,247 --> 01:47:51,748
I feel sorry for you.

1992
01:47:51,749 --> 01:47:53,750
I knew that's
why he came here...

1993
01:47:53,751 --> 01:47:57,253
To find, uh, you know, some
way of squirming out of it.

1994
01:47:57,254 --> 01:47:58,755
God.

1995
01:47:58,756 --> 01:48:00,757
It's pathetic.

1996
01:48:00,758 --> 01:48:02,759
Ha ha. Oh, God.

1997
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:05,261
The more I think about it.

1998
01:48:05,262 --> 01:48:07,263
You know, my papa didn't
tell the half of it.

1999
01:48:07,264 --> 01:48:10,700
They were into all sorts
of things that never came up at the trial.

2000
01:48:10,701 --> 01:48:13,603
Missiles, germ warfare,
gas, everything.

2001
01:48:13,604 --> 01:48:15,605
Your parents
ran the show, Danny.

2002
01:48:15,606 --> 01:48:18,608
They planned things,
they paid people off.

2003
01:48:18,609 --> 01:48:20,610
Lasers! You know,
they were into lasers

2004
01:48:20,611 --> 01:48:22,912
years before anybody had
even heard of lasers.

2005
01:48:22,913 --> 01:48:26,916
So don't tell me my papa
sacrificed them or anybody.

2006
01:48:26,917 --> 01:48:28,919
Another couple?

2007
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:32,755
My God. It's pitiful.

2008
01:48:32,756 --> 01:48:36,326
Linda, I didn't come
3,000 Miles to hear the family line.

2009
01:48:36,327 --> 01:48:38,328
Look, I've wasted enough time.

2010
01:48:38,329 --> 01:48:41,498
Please. I-I-I'm sorry.
We can't do anything for you.

2011
01:48:46,503 --> 01:48:48,004
Oh, Linda.

2012
01:48:49,006 --> 01:48:52,508
You're not the little
hipster I used to know.

2013
01:48:52,509 --> 01:48:55,511
Dale here with his dacron suit,

2014
01:48:55,512 --> 01:48:59,015
his little tie,
his nice little haircut.

2015
01:48:59,016 --> 01:49:01,017
I mean, if they were
his parents,

2016
01:49:01,018 --> 01:49:03,519
he'd want it to be
another couple.

2017
01:49:03,520 --> 01:49:05,021
But look at me.

2018
01:49:06,523 --> 01:49:09,025
Do I look like Dale?

2019
01:49:12,029 --> 01:49:14,530
Whatever it is, Linda,

2020
01:49:14,531 --> 01:49:16,032
I can live with it.

2021
01:49:17,534 --> 01:49:21,037
Shit, this could
be another planet.

2022
01:49:21,038 --> 01:49:23,039
I think there's
something wrong with you.

2023
01:49:23,040 --> 01:49:25,041
Don't you want
your life on earth?

2024
01:49:25,042 --> 01:49:28,044
Don't you want to come
back to the world?

2025
01:49:28,045 --> 01:49:31,048
Whatever it is, Linda,
I want to live with it.

2026
01:49:33,050 --> 01:49:34,550
Let Selig tell me
what you just told me.

2027
01:49:34,551 --> 01:49:37,053
Let him tell me,
let me know the guys he put the finger on,

2028
01:49:37,054 --> 01:49:40,057
the guys who did it
or didn't do it...

2029
01:49:41,558 --> 01:49:43,560
I want to hear it from him.

2030
01:49:45,562 --> 01:49:47,564
I want to know.

2031
01:49:50,067 --> 01:49:51,568
That's all.

2032
01:50:38,354 --> 01:50:39,855
Hello, papa.

2033
01:50:44,360 --> 01:50:45,860
Papa...

2034
01:50:45,861 --> 01:50:49,864
Do you remember Danny Isaacson?

2035
01:50:49,865 --> 01:50:50,866
Hmm?

2036
01:50:56,872 --> 01:50:58,272
You see?

2037
01:50:58,273 --> 01:51:01,209
You can ask him
anything you want, Danny.

2038
01:51:08,217 --> 01:51:09,718
Hello, Dr. Mindish.

2039
01:51:13,222 --> 01:51:14,723
It's Danny.

2040
01:51:27,536 --> 01:51:29,037
It's Danny.

2041
01:51:32,241 --> 01:51:35,244
Danny Isaacson.

2042
01:51:40,883 --> 01:51:43,385
Paul and Rochelle's son.

2043
01:51:49,992 --> 01:51:50,993
Danny?

2044
01:52:00,202 --> 01:52:01,703
It's...

2045
01:52:04,206 --> 01:52:05,873
It's Danny.

2046
01:52:05,874 --> 01:52:07,875
It's all right, papa.

2047
01:52:07,876 --> 01:52:09,377
It's all right.

2048
01:52:30,399 --> 01:52:32,400
Do you remember Susan,

2049
01:52:32,401 --> 01:52:34,336
your little girl Susan?

2050
01:52:40,743 --> 01:52:43,712
I wanted to give her something.

2051
01:53:06,802 --> 01:53:10,305
Is there such a thing
as too much hope?

2052
01:53:22,084 --> 01:53:25,087
Electricity is
a form of energy.

2053
01:53:26,588 --> 01:53:29,590
It is generated by power
sources driven by water,

2054
01:53:29,591 --> 01:53:31,593
steam, or atomic fission.

2055
01:53:33,095 --> 01:53:36,097
The two leading electric
power producing countries

2056
01:53:36,098 --> 01:53:39,100
in the world are
the United States of America

2057
01:53:39,101 --> 01:53:42,104
and the union of the Soviet
Socialist Republics.

2058
01:53:44,039 --> 01:53:46,040
The theory of electricity
is that atoms

2059
01:53:46,041 --> 01:53:48,042
gain or lose electrons.

2060
01:53:48,043 --> 01:53:52,547
Thus become positively
or negatively charged.

2061
01:53:52,548 --> 01:53:55,550
In this way,
a current is produced

2062
01:53:55,551 --> 01:53:59,187
and a current is designed
to flow through a circuit.

2063
01:55:44,393 --> 01:55:46,928
Aw, Paulie.

2064
01:55:48,430 --> 01:55:50,498
Aw, my pop.

2065
01:55:54,002 --> 01:55:56,004
Oh, Rochelle.

2066
01:56:01,743 --> 01:56:03,544
I will not have him here.

2067
01:56:07,182 --> 01:56:09,617
Let my son
be bar mitzvahed today.

2068
01:56:11,853 --> 01:56:14,288
Let our deaths
be his bar mitzvah.

2069
01:58:30,592 --> 01:58:33,094
You'll have to do it again.

2070
01:58:45,073 --> 01:58:50,077
There's a man going 'round

2071
01:58:50,078 --> 01:58:56,083
taking names

2072
01:58:56,084 --> 01:59:01,188
there's a man going 'round

2073
01:59:01,189 --> 01:59:04,692
taking names

2074
01:59:04,693 --> 01:59:09,196
he has taken my mother's name

2075
01:59:09,197 --> 01:59:15,202
and has left my heart in pain

2076
01:59:15,203 --> 01:59:20,007
there's a man going 'round

2077
01:59:20,008 --> 01:59:26,514
taking names

2078
01:59:26,515 --> 01:59:32,119
there's a man going 'round

2079
01:59:32,120 --> 01:59:37,625
taking names, taking names

2080
01:59:37,626 --> 01:59:42,630
there's a man going 'round

2081
01:59:42,631 --> 01:59:47,134
taking names, taking names

2082
01:59:47,135 --> 01:59:52,139
he has taken my father's name

2083
01:59:52,140 --> 01:59:57,645
and has left my heart in pain

2084
01:59:57,646 --> 02:00:03,817
there's a man going 'round

2085
02:00:03,818 --> 02:00:09,924
taking names

2086
02:00:09,925 --> 02:00:21,435
now death is the man
taking names

2087
02:00:21,436 --> 02:00:30,945
yes, death is the man
taking names

2088
02:00:30,946 --> 02:00:36,450
he has taken my brother's name

2089
02:00:36,451 --> 02:00:44,391
and has left my heart in pain

2090
02:00:44,392 --> 02:00:51,899
there's a man going 'round

2091
02:00:51,900 --> 02:01:00,308
taking names

2092
02:01:26,835 --> 02:01:29,837
We're ready for the service.

2093
02:01:29,838 --> 02:01:32,340
You wanted your own rabbi.

2094
02:01:44,352 --> 02:01:46,353
The name?

2095
02:01:46,354 --> 02:01:48,856
Uh, Susan.
Susan Isaacson.

2096
02:01:50,358 --> 02:01:52,860
That's Susan Isaacson.

2097
02:01:52,861 --> 02:01:53,862
Yes, sir.

2098
02:01:54,863 --> 02:01:56,864
That's Susan...

2099
02:01:56,865 --> 02:01:57,865
Susan...

2100
02:01:57,866 --> 02:01:59,366
Isaacson.
Susan Isaacson.

2101
02:01:59,367 --> 02:02:00,868
And then when you're
through with that,

2102
02:02:00,869 --> 02:02:02,369
in the name of Paul...

2103
02:02:02,370 --> 02:02:03,871
Paul...

2104
02:02:03,872 --> 02:02:04,872
And then
in the name of Rochelle.

2105
02:02:04,873 --> 02:02:05,373
And Rochelle.

2106
02:02:06,875 --> 02:02:09,377
In the name of all of them.

2107
02:03:19,180 --> 02:03:24,451
This little light of mine

2108
02:03:24,452 --> 02:03:28,622
I'm going to let it shine

2109
02:03:28,623 --> 02:03:33,761

2117
02:04:06,428 --> 02:04:11,498
I'm going to let it shine

2118
02:04:11,499 --> 02:04:16,236

2119
02:04:16,237 --> 02:04:20,607
I'm going to let it shine

2120
02:04:20,608 --> 02:04:24,611
everywhere I go

2121
02:04:24,612 --> 02:04:28,849
I'm going to let it shine

2122
02:04:28,850 --> 02:04:30,851
let it shine

2123
02:04:30,852 --> 02:04:32,853

2124
02:04:32,854 --> 02:04:37,859
let it shine

2125
02:05:17,966 --> 02:05:21,969
All through the night

2126
02:05:21,970 --> 02:05:26,473
I'm going to let it shine

2127
02:05:26,474 --> 02:05:31,011
all through the night

2128
02:05:31,012 --> 02:05:35,516
I'm going to let it shine

2129
02:05:35,517 --> 02:05:39,920
all through the night

2130
02:05:39,921 --> 02:05:42,923
I'm going to let it shine

2131
02:05:42,924 --> 02:05:47,427
