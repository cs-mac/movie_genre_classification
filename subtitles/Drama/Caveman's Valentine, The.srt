00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:52,166
No. For leaning on my shoulder? Come on,
it's the Ieast I could do. A 14-hour flight.

301
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,503
Oh, God, that's better.

302
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:58,881
-You on active duty?
-Yes, sir.

303
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:03,302
-Two bars. Is that lieutenant?
-Two bars is the captain.

304
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:08,266
You have a loved one in L.A.?

305
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:13,187
Well, I'm sure he'Il be happy to see you.

306
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:19,277
How long--? How Iong has it been
since you've been home?

307
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,612
EIeven months.

308
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,739
And how long do you get to stay?

309
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:25,366
Just tiIl tomorrow.

310
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:31,080
Wow. Fourteen-hour flight both ways
just for one night.

311
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,207
Wow, that's romantic.

312
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:36,168
You're a romantic.
I mean, that's quite a gesture.

313
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:40,339
That's commitment.

314
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:47,763
You on Facebook?

315
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:54,562
WOMAN: I need some chrysanthemums.
-What? You should speak English.

316
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,732
-I had to learn when I came.
-Chrysanthemums and calIa IiIies.

317
00:21:57,899 --> 00:21:59,942
-I don't know what it--
-Michael, calm down.

318
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,736
What language do you speak in?

319
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:05,614
I used to speak Bulgarian,
but I'm an American citizen now.

320
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:08,701
Does anybody here speak English
with a Bulgarian accent?

321
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,120
MAN: Over here. I do.
-There he is.

322
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,748
Bulgarize away. Here we go.

323
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:16,208
There she is!
The future Mrs. Reed Bennett!

324
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:18,377
MICHAEL:
Oh, chrysanthemums.

325
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,755
-Hi, babe.
-Hi, baby.

326
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:22,965
Hello, fiancée.

327
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:26,344
It sounds weird. Have you said it yet?
Nikki, take over for a minute.

328
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:27,720
Come this way.

329
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:31,057
Wait, these are for you.
I knew they were for somebody.

330
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:34,185
-Sarah, have you met my fiancée?
-Hi, Morley.

331
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:38,856
-Hi.
-I just like saying it. I feel so grown-up.

332
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,441
MICHAEL:
Next, please!

333
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:45,071
-Look what you forgot.
-See, that is....

334
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:48,532
Is one empty hand.

335
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:51,702
Oh, yeah.

336
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,079
Don't be mad.

337
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:55,289
Mad? Why would I be mad?
I'm concerned.

338
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:58,042
Well, just....

339
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:01,837
Do you have any idea what it wouId be
like at work today if I wore that thing?

340
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:05,633
-I mean, peopIe wiIl be asking me--
-"Where'd you get the big ring?"

341
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:09,720
You know, "How many bridesmaids?"
And, "How did he do it?"

342
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:13,474
-"Gonna have kids? How many?"
-Three.

343
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:17,228
-What?
-Two dogs, and maybe some chickens.

344
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:21,065
-We can taIk about it. We don't have to.
-Sweetheart, I just think right now...

345
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:25,694
...it would be better if maybe
we could just keep it a secret.

346
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,947
MAN: Where are you from?
WOMAN: I am from Ruse.

347
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:31,409
AIl right, you guys can start
a BuIgarian village together. AIl right.

348
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:34,161
Oh, my God, look, there's the bride. Hi.

349
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:36,997
Listen, I calIed my BFF, Tony.
He is aIready on the dress.

350
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:40,334
He does all the gowns in Vegas.
Cher, Celine, Carrot Top.

351
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:42,837
This is going to be so much fun!
Oh, my God, it's--

352
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:45,589
-Breathe, breathe.
-I have to breathe.

353
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:46,799
Okay.

354
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,970
-See what I mean?
-Yep, I get it.

355
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,180
EDGAR:
So...

356
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:56,475
...love is the problem?

357
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,770
-Did you ever have it?
-Oh, yeah.

358
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,481
EDISON:
How old were you when you got it?

359
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:07,194
Let's see. I'd just started working
at an architectural firm...

360
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:12,116
...and there was this beautiful young girl,
and she was studying to be an actress.

361
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:14,452
Was your heart kind of going:

362
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:19,540
Yeah. Yeah, just that way. It went,
bumpada, bumpada, bumpada, boom.

363
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,584
You betcha. Just like that.

364
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:24,044
One day I got up the courage
to introduce myseIf.

365
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:28,716
I walk out, walked right up to her
and opened my mouth and...

366
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,051
-...nothing comes out.
-Nothing?

367
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:37,016
Nothing. Not a peep. But she's just waiting
for me to say something, I'm like a statue.

368
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:41,061
So finaIly she says,
"AlI right, I'lI meet you here at 6:30."

369
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:43,189
She knew what you were going to say.

370
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:48,402
Yep. Yeah. She's been reading my mind
like that for 51 years.

371
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,655
The pretty girl was Grandma, right?

372
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:55,367
The pretty girl is Grandma, right?

373
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:59,163
-When are we gonna get there, Grandpa?
-Coming up to Moorpark.

374
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:03,918
Making a left turn right here.
What's Moorpark speIled backwards?

375
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:06,587
EDISON: I don't know.
-"Kraproom."

376
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:09,715
-Grandpa.
-And don't say that in school.

377
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,092

But we gotta hustle. They're flying in now.

380
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,932
I'm aIways hustling, baby.

381
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:21,644
REED: No, no, no. Like, "hustle" hustle.
Like, no, don't dilly-dalIy, okay?

382
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:23,646
Let me teIl you, I don't dilly-dally.

When a man loves a woman

386
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:32,780
Crazy businessman.

387
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:37,326
This guy, Iike, he wants to give
famiIy discounts to his 30 cousins.

00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:40,621
What is this?
What have you got going--?

389
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,417
Excuse me. Can I help you?

390
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:49,713
I'd like to send a dozen of those
to the best girl at my schooI.

391
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:52,883
-And this musical card.
-A dozen of those with thi--?

This-- It's....

00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:00,307
Okay.

394
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:05,896
-All right, where am I sending these to?
-Falcon Crest Elementary.

395
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:07,314
You can MapQuest it.

396
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:10,317
I actualIy know where it's at.
I got a friend that goes there.

397
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:13,779
Cool. During recess
would be the best time.

398
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:17,575
When you get there, just hand me
the flowers, and I'll do the rest.

399
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:21,287
-Okay?
-I'lI be there. Thank you, sir.

400
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:24,164
What's up with the cutest kid in the world
coming in here?

401
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:28,919
And he shorted me. He just gave me, Iike,
1 5 bucks for a $55 arrangement.

402
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:32,673
-Could I pIease have my receipt?
-What, did you get audited last year?

403
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:33,882
I did.

404
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:37,886
They always get the good guys,
I'm teIling you. Here.

JASON:
So, like, Iast night, amazing.

407
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:49,106
This morning,
she couldn't get away fast enough.

408
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:53,193
Any chance there was a little, shaIl we say,
disappointment on her part?

409
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:56,780
No. What? No. None.

410
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:58,032
At all.

411
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:03,370
-Well-- No, no, no. It was fine.
-Fine's not good enough, dude.

412
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:06,040
It was better than fine.
It was a soIid A.

413
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:09,209
Minus. B plus, A minus. A minus.

414
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:11,587
I hate VaIentine's Day.

415
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:15,591
Why can't these guys deliver their
flowers to their girlfriends themselves?

416
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:18,844
-Wait, what?
-They just dump them in the mailroom.

417
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:22,306
-I mean, if they don't wanna take the time to--
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

418
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:25,351
-It's Valentine's Day today?
-HeIlo?

419
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:27,102
Happy VaIentine's Day.

420
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:30,856
Wha--? No, it's a Monday.
Valentine's Day always falls on a Thursday.

421
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:33,901
That's Thanksgiving, Hoosier-head.

422
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:38,238
-Really?
-You're 25. You thought that for 25 years?

423
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:41,659
Dude, he's from Indiana.
They only celebrate Love Your Cousin Day.

424
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:45,829
No, you're thinking of Kentucky. Of course
Liz was acting weird this morning.

425
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:48,374
You do have something planned
for tonight, right?

426
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:53,045
How could I have something planned for
tonight? I didn't even know until right now.

427
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:57,800
I can do my lunch break,
and I can do after 5?

428
00:27:57,967 --> 00:28:00,094
Okay, great.

429
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:02,429
No, no, no.
I don't mind peopIe with fetishes.

430
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:06,225
No, no, no, very creative people.
I gotta put you on hold, sorry.

431
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:07,976
Good morning.

432
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:13,607
-You're a strong, confident person.
-Good morning. Who are you?

433
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:16,694
I am Liz. I am one of the receptionists.
I'm subbing for Monica.

434
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:19,613
Oh, yeah, Monica,
because she wanted today off.

435
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:21,448
Shit, she has a life.

436
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:24,576
She had a funeral, which is a life,
I guess.

437
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:26,453
Well, Liz, I'm Paula.

438
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:31,083
I know they call me Bipolar Paula. Don't.
But you should know I'm in crisis.

439
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:33,752
-Okay.
-I don't wanna talk about it.

440
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,130
-Okay.
-It has nothing to do with being alone...

441
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:38,340
-...on Valentine's Day.
-Of course not.

442
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:42,302
And everything to do with the cIient
in crisis.

443
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:46,265
-That sounds chaIlenging.
-"Challenging"?

444
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:49,309
Gotta figure out if he still has
an athIetic career.

445
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:52,396
If he doesn't, big fat problemo.

446

And with football season officially over...

what will Sean Jackson do?

A devastating loss
in the championship game last week...

...he's one of the oldest quarterbacks
in the league.

But it's not my decision.

STORM: lfnot,
will he test the waters of free agency?

463
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,793
Or will he make this easier on
everyone...

I'm surprising him.

-Oh, yeah. Guys love surprises.
-Is that sarcasm?

898
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:33,657
I surprised my husband once.
Now he's my ex-husband.

-But you sell tickets, right?

916

That counter is for oversized people

01:54:18,518 --> 01:54:19,810
Hi.

1783
01:54:23,606 --> 01:54:25,774
-Sorry.
-Yeah.

1784
01:54:27,735 --> 01:54:29,945
What are you doing with the flowers?

1785
01:54:30,488 --> 01:54:32,698
REED:
They're aIl the ones that nobody wants.

1786
01:54:32,866 --> 01:54:35,033
So you're giving them a second life?

1787
01:54:36,077 --> 01:54:38,620
Yeah, most shops throw them away.

1788
01:54:40,915 --> 01:54:45,669
I like the idea that tomorrow, somebody's
gonna see them floating by and--

1789
01:54:45,837 --> 01:54:47,087
Yeah.

1790
01:54:47,255 --> 01:54:49,965
--wonder where they come from.
And the mystery of it all.

1791
01:54:50,133 --> 01:54:52,801
I used to actually put them together...

1792
01:54:53,803 --> 01:54:56,513
...and practice new designs with them...

1793
01:54:56,681 --> 01:55:00,142
...and drop them off at a random doorstep
with a note saying:

1794
01:55:00,310 --> 01:55:02,978
"Somebody out there loves you."

1795
01:55:03,313 --> 01:55:05,355
Then I got to thinking...

1796
01:55:06,691 --> 01:55:09,401
...what if they found out
that someone was me?

1797
01:55:09,986 --> 01:55:12,237
Would they want me to be the one that
loves them?

1798
01:55:14,282 --> 01:55:15,490
I would...

1799
01:55:18,036 --> 01:55:19,661
...want that.

1800
01:55:25,543 --> 01:55:27,210
Am I about to kiss my best friend?

1801
01:55:29,172 --> 01:55:30,881
I hope so.

1802
01:55:41,017 --> 01:55:44,186
-Not great.
-That was awkward. Awkward.

1803
01:55:44,354 --> 01:55:46,480
-Just not great.
-Yep.

1804
01:55:46,648 --> 01:55:49,399
-But this is my old-- Where I get down.
-This is your spot.

1805
01:55:49,567 --> 01:55:51,360
You realIy helped me out. Susan is....

1806
01:55:51,527 --> 01:55:54,446
-Giving me a chance to be number one.
KARA: Congratulations.

1807
01:55:54,614 --> 01:55:56,073
-Thank you, again.
-Thank you.

1808
01:55:56,240 --> 01:55:58,158
-I'm gonna have to teach you.
-That is....

1809
01:55:58,493 --> 01:56:00,535
KELVIN: No-- I'll teach you this.
KARA: It's not natural.

1810
01:56:00,703 --> 01:56:03,080
-Keep the fist-- It's a little--
-Thank you. Okay.

1811
01:56:03,247 --> 01:56:04,873
-No, no, no. Open your--
-Open.

1812
01:56:05,041 --> 01:56:07,542
-You know what? I got a better idea.
-Not happening.

1813
01:56:15,551 --> 01:56:17,010
Okay.

1814
01:56:17,595 --> 01:56:19,596
That was nice.

1815
01:56:22,976 --> 01:56:26,395
Well, you didn't exactly, Iike,
knock it out of the park.

1816
01:56:26,562 --> 01:56:30,482
Well, we've never practiced,
you have to admit.

1817
01:56:30,650 --> 01:56:33,735
-Maybe we shouId practice, then.
-Okay.

1818
01:56:52,088 --> 01:56:53,505
Mommy!

1819
01:56:58,511 --> 01:57:05,976
You're so big.

1820
01:57:21,576 --> 01:57:23,618
-Did you imagine it better or worse?
-I did.

1821
01:57:23,786 --> 01:57:26,038
-You imagined it better?
-I gave you more credit.

1822
01:57:26,205 --> 01:57:27,247
-Really?
-Yeah.

1823
01:57:27,415 --> 01:57:31,543
-Well, I hate that I'm not living up to my--
-Well, I don't know.

1824
01:57:45,641 --> 01:57:48,977
MAN [ON RADIO]:
It's Romeo Midnight, one last time.

1825
01:57:49,145 --> 01:57:52,939
Only 30 seconds left now
before it's just another day.

1826
01:57:53,107 --> 01:57:54,649
So count it down with me, lovers.

1827
01:57:54,817 --> 01:57:59,613
And raise your glass to those three
little words that we all want to hear:

1828
01:57:59,781 --> 01:58:03,658
"Let's get naked."

1829
01:58:15,421 --> 01:58:18,423
I never had a inkling before, man.
I didn't know what to do.

1830
01:58:18,591 --> 01:58:21,009
I need to get to the airport.

1831
01:58:22,720 --> 01:58:24,262
Stupid--!

1832
01:58:29,936 --> 01:58:31,937
VIadimir! Let me get my whip.

1833
01:58:35,483 --> 01:58:38,860
You know I always
wanna answer yours first--

1834
01:58:41,197 --> 01:58:42,823
Oh! Just-- Let's do--

1835
01:58:43,533 --> 01:58:46,701
I never had a inkling before.
I didn't know what to do with it.

1836
01:58:46,869 --> 01:58:48,954
Shoot, we gotta get to the--

1837
01:58:49,122 --> 01:58:52,874
It's stupid. Stupid seat belt!

1838
01:59:00,633 --> 01:59:03,051
ELIZONDO: Oh, there's a--
Hold it, there's a finger in there.

1839
01:59:03,678 --> 01:59:04,845
You on Facebook?

1840
01:59:05,972 --> 01:59:08,390
I can't hear out of this ear.

1841
01:59:10,143 --> 01:59:11,643
Are you guys on Facebook?

1842
01:59:11,811 --> 01:59:14,729
I never had a inkling before.
I didn't know what to do with it.

1843
01:59:14,897 --> 01:59:17,941
AIl right. I gotta get to the airport.

1844
01:59:18,109 --> 01:59:21,945
She's probably at the gate by now.

1845
01:59:22,113 --> 01:59:23,155
How did you do that?

1846
01:59:29,704 --> 01:59:31,705
-Hey, I'm Taylor.
-And I'm Taylor. Too.

1847
01:59:31,873 --> 01:59:34,583
Yeah. It's confusing. Yeah, we know that.

1848
01:59:34,750 --> 01:59:36,251
Marker.

1849
01:59:36,419 --> 01:59:38,211
REDMOND: If you look out the window,
ma'am...

1850
01:59:38,379 --> 01:59:39,921
...we're passing
the famous Rodeo Drive.

1851
01:59:40,089 --> 01:59:43,466
-Have you ever shopped here?
-I did once, actuaIly.

1852
01:59:43,634 --> 01:59:47,721
But, big mistake. Big. Huge.
