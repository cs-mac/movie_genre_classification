1
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,633
Um...

2
00:01:31,733 --> 00:01:33,067
I'll take this one.

3
00:01:33,133 --> 00:01:34,400
That one.

4
00:01:36,067 --> 00:01:37,367
Oh, look.

5
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,767
This.

6
00:01:38,867 --> 00:01:41,567
Oh, really?
This one's for me.

7
00:01:43,767 --> 00:01:45,900
Oh, I want that, too.

8
00:01:46,067 --> 00:01:47,467
I like those.
You do?

9
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:52,833
Oh, Maude,
isn't that stunning?

10
00:01:52,933 --> 00:01:54,067
I'd rather have mink.

11
00:01:54,133 --> 00:01:56,533
You would?
Mink is so every day.

12
00:01:56,633 --> 00:01:59,233
I don't care.
We're wishing for
what we want, aren't we?

13
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:01,067
Yeah.
Well, I want mink.

14
00:02:01,133 --> 00:02:05,067
Well, all right.
Have mink.
I want chinchilla.

15
00:02:06,733 --> 00:02:08,167
What do you
spend on lunches?

16
00:02:08,633 --> 00:02:09,867
Depends.

17
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,667
Can't you give me
an average?

18
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:16,333
Well, 65 cents.
(TALKING UNDER BREATH)

19
00:02:16,433 --> 00:02:18,367
Four... Two...

20
00:02:18,467 --> 00:02:20,267
65.

21
00:02:20,367 --> 00:02:25,333
(UNDER BREATH)
65 times six, that's
3.90 a week. Hmm...

22
00:02:25,433 --> 00:02:26,867
How about car fare?

23
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:31,267
30 cents a day.
30 cents a day.

24
00:02:32,067 --> 00:02:35,733
(SPEAKING TO SELF)

25
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:39,100
Well, I'll have
to say the same,
it's the same...

26
00:02:41,667 --> 00:02:46,067
Well, if you don't spend
more than a quarter
a day for lunch,

27
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,833
and if you don't wear
stockings, you don't
go to the movies,

28
00:02:49,933 --> 00:02:52,067
unless somebody takes you,

29
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,300
you can go to school.

30
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,533
Oh, yes,
and you can't buy
any more magazines.

31
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,433
Gee, maybe
it isn't worth it.

32
00:02:59,533 --> 00:03:02,133
Maybe you want to spend
the rest of your life
as a carhop, huh?

33
00:03:02,233 --> 00:03:04,400
Oh, don't be a stoop.

34
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,300
Ooh, my feet
are just killing me.

35
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,967
Everything swells up
in the heat.

36
00:03:08,067 --> 00:03:11,300
It isn't the heat,
it's the humidity...
It's the humidity, yeah.

37
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,833
Whose turn to wash?

38
00:03:12,933 --> 00:03:14,700
Yours, I dry.

39
00:03:16,667 --> 00:03:18,867
Well, I'll get started.

40
00:03:18,967 --> 00:03:22,500
No, I just meant,
why couldn't you help me
get a modeling job now?

41
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,333
I've told you 10 times,

42
00:03:24,433 --> 00:03:26,433
I don't want to
use my influence
'til you're ready,

43
00:03:26,533 --> 00:03:28,400
and you won't be ready
'til you go to school.

44
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,667
According to this, I won't
need your old influence.

45
00:03:30,767 --> 00:03:32,133
Hmm.

46
00:03:32,233 --> 00:03:35,900
"Dorothy Dale places
all her graduates
in the finest positions."

47
00:03:36,067 --> 00:03:38,733
Mmm, she looks
like a pretty nifty number.
MAXINE: Yeah.

48
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:40,433
I'll bet this was retouched.

49
00:03:40,533 --> 00:03:42,733
You know, you're
not going just
to get a better job.

50
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:45,867
A charm school's like
college and finishing
school combined.

51
00:03:45,967 --> 00:03:47,700
I can read, Maxine.

52
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,667
Well, all I can say is
without a social education,

53
00:03:50,767 --> 00:03:52,567
you're never going
to meet a real man.

54
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:54,567
And what's the matter
with George?

55
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:56,967
He'll never be able
to buy you a mink coat.

56
00:03:57,067 --> 00:03:58,833
"Girls," Dorothy Dale asks,

57
00:03:58,933 --> 00:04:00,600
"What is your most
important asset?"

58
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,067
Answer, "Your smile.
Be charming."

59
00:04:03,167 --> 00:04:04,900
Uh-hmm, be charming,
that's what I told you.

60
00:04:05,067 --> 00:04:06,767
(SIGHS) Oh, dear,

61
00:04:06,867 --> 00:04:10,067
I'd love to go back to
Denver with a mink coat
someday, Maxine.

62
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:11,300
Mmm-hmm.

63
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,833
Two mink coats,
one for my mother.

64
00:04:14,933 --> 00:04:17,633
I guess it won't kill me
to have 25-cent lunches.

65
00:04:17,733 --> 00:04:20,967
No. You still
have to wear
stockings anyway.

66
00:04:21,067 --> 00:04:23,200
How long a course
should I take, Maxine?

67
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,633
Six weeks.

68
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:26,967
Gee,

69
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:28,933
wouldn't it be wonderful if...

70
00:04:29,067 --> 00:04:33,100
If after I graduate, I start
working in the model...
And modeling in the store

71
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,800
like you for
a few weeks and...

72
00:04:35,533 --> 00:04:37,967
And then one day,

73
00:04:38,067 --> 00:04:40,400
in walks a handsome,
young millionaire.

74
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,133
Yeah. Wouldn't it
be wonderful?

75
00:04:42,233 --> 00:04:45,233
And he's standing at the
perfume counter and...

76
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:48,700
And then suddenly
he turns around
and sees me.

77
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,433
And we don't say a word
for a long time and...

78
00:04:51,533 --> 00:04:52,500
And then he says...

79
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,900
Will you start
drying the dishes?

80
00:04:55,067 --> 00:04:59,133
(SIGHS)
Okay, but, it could happen.

81
00:04:59,233 --> 00:05:01,267
Uh-hmm.
Dorothy Dale says,

82
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:04,100
"A charm school
girl's future
is unlimited.

83
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,433
"Once she leaves
our doors, she is ready
to meet anyone socially

84
00:05:07,533 --> 00:05:09,833
"and ready
to hit her jackpot."
See?

85
00:05:15,067 --> 00:05:17,167
Good evening,
Miss Chambers.
Good evening, Miss Blaine.

86
00:05:17,267 --> 00:05:18,800
Good evening,
Miss Chambers.

87
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,533
Oh, Miss Eames...

88
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:22,833
About your tuition...

89
00:05:22,933 --> 00:05:25,633
You know, each week
must be paid in advance.

90
00:05:25,733 --> 00:05:28,300
Oh, I'm sorry,
Miss Chambers.

Oh, yes, we'd be glad
to recommend a model.

93
00:05:35,633 --> 00:05:37,900
All of our models
are highly qualified.

94
00:05:39,067 --> 00:05:41,467
Yes, Mr. Lawrence,
she'll be there at 9:00.

Look, could I give
you five now and...

98
00:05:47,167 --> 00:05:48,933
And the other five
when I come Thursday?

99
00:05:49,867 --> 00:05:51,067
Thursday?

100
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:53,300
Thursday.
Certainly.

101
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,067
Miss Maude Eames,

102
00:05:55,567 --> 00:05:57,167
five dollars.

103
00:05:57,267 --> 00:06:00,800
Oh, would you mind
making that Leonora Eames?
I've changed it.

104
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,533
Not at all.

105
00:06:02,633 --> 00:06:03,800
"Leonora."

106
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,067
"Leonora," that's charming!

107
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:07,133
Thank you.

108
00:06:08,767 --> 00:06:09,933
Thank you.

109
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,833

Thank you so much
for having me.

113
00:06:21,933 --> 00:06:23,400
Pick up your bag.

114
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,200
Oh, I'm sorry.
Thank you.

115
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:31,167
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.

116
00:06:31,267 --> 00:06:33,367
Bravo that was
quite nice.

117

Cross your legs,

118

Now, may we have
Miss Eames?

Yes, Miss Dale.

Mink.

Mine too.

or not, this is

Oh, Miss, just a minute.

129
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,733
Only 4995, plus tax.

130
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:17,600
Five thousand,
that's not too bad.

131
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,867
Do you like
the full back?
Oh, I adore it.

Come along, darling.
Better have
the old one glazed.

00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,533
Oh, you're right.

137
00:07:29,633 --> 00:07:31,500
I'd rather make
him buy me
a new bracelet anyway.

138
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,067
Of course
you would, darling.

139
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,733
Like it, darling?

140
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:39,533
Oh, I hope you're
not offended, because
I call everyone darling.

141
00:07:39,633 --> 00:07:41,467
What a charming coat.

Uh, may I see the lining?

Only 4995, plus tax.

144

Plus tax, charming,
darling, charming.

145

I think we
haven't been working
here long, yes?

146
00:07:53,867 --> 00:07:54,867
Yes.

147
00:07:54,967 --> 00:07:57,167
Hold this a moment,
will you, darling?

148
00:07:57,267 --> 00:08:01,200
I'm giving a party,
a lovely party
this weekend, on a yacht.

149
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,600
There. (BLOWS)
We go to Catalina.

150
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,067
No, thank you.

151
00:08:05,133 --> 00:08:08,133
There'll be lots
of people, darling.
Fresh air, sunshine, and,

152
00:08:08,233 --> 00:08:10,100
if you don't like it,
you can leave.

153
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,500
No, thanks.
Now, don't be a silly
bourgeois, darling.

154
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,900
You have work to do,
I have work to do. Now,

155
00:08:16,067 --> 00:08:18,300
we can chat here for
hours but...

156
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,300
We would still
get to the same point,
wouldn't we?

157
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:25,233
The yacht belongs
to my business associate,
charming.

158
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,133
We leave from my place
at 6:30 on Friday.

159
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,933
Uh...

160
00:08:33,567 --> 00:08:35,933
It will be divine, darling.

161
00:08:37,167 --> 00:08:40,233
Nice relaxation.
Toodle-oo.

162
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,633
Did you get
an invitation?

163
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:48,167
I'm not going.
You're out
of your head.

164
00:08:48,267 --> 00:08:50,367
9995, handmade from...

165
00:08:50,467 --> 00:08:51,733
Sorry, just looking.

166
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:54,933
Don't you know
who the party's for?

167
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:56,500
Smith Ohlrig,
whoever that is.

168
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,433
Only the "Wall"
in Wall Street, dearie.

169
00:08:58,533 --> 00:08:59,733
The little poodle
works for him.

170
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,667
Mmm-hmm?
Mmm-hmm.

171
00:09:01,767 --> 00:09:04,967
9995,
handmade from...
Here, darling.

172
00:09:07,533 --> 00:09:09,067
Those parties are
supposed to be terrific.

173
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,433
They'll have to do
without me.

174
00:09:10,533 --> 00:09:12,067
Poor you.

175
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:16,867
Only 4995, plus tax.

176
00:09:19,467 --> 00:09:20,933
I'm not going, Maxine.

177
00:09:21,067 --> 00:09:24,733
How else do poor girls
like us get to meet
guys like Ohlrig?

178
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:28,233
It's just no use, Maxine.
I just... Look terrible.

179
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,300
I'm not going.
All in your head.

180
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,400
I'm not the type
for this dress and...

181
00:09:33,133 --> 00:09:35,500
This zipper!

182
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,133
And I'm not
the type for the
yachting party either.

183
00:09:38,233 --> 00:09:40,133
How do you know?
You've never
been on one.

184
00:09:40,233 --> 00:09:42,367
That's the only
reason I wanted to go.

185
00:09:42,467 --> 00:09:45,233
Just to find out
what it would be like,

186
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,633
but not with those characters.

187
00:09:47,733 --> 00:09:50,567
Any man that goes
to a party like that
has just one idea,

188
00:09:50,667 --> 00:09:52,767
and that's one idea
too many for me.

189
00:09:52,867 --> 00:09:54,500
You can take care
of yourself.

190
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,600
I don't want to go to a
party where I have to worry
about taking care of myself.

191
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,967
Unzip me, please.

192
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:02,133
Well, it's up to you.

193
00:10:02,233 --> 00:10:04,500
But the party is an
investment, Nora.
I know, I know,

194
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,667
I should think of security.

195
00:10:05,767 --> 00:10:07,067
That's right.
(KNOCKING)
Hi.

196
00:10:07,167 --> 00:10:08,633
Who is it?
Velma.

197
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,000
Velma, see?

198
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,433
And what is
security? Money.

199
00:10:12,533 --> 00:10:14,833
Period.
Exclamation point.

200
00:10:15,267 --> 00:10:16,267
Hello.
Hi.

201
00:10:16,367 --> 00:10:17,700
Um, here's
the fur, girls,

202
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,133
and I'm sorry I'm
late, but I had to...
Oh, thanks, but...

203
00:10:20,233 --> 00:10:21,867
Maybe you
ought to go home.

204
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,833
Oh, well...

205
00:10:23,933 --> 00:10:26,367
I brought some gloves
in case you needed them.
Thanks.

206
00:10:26,467 --> 00:10:28,033
They're stunning,
Velma, thanks a lot.

207
00:10:28,133 --> 00:10:29,867
Well, I really don't
have to go yet...
I'll see you tomorrow.

208
00:10:29,967 --> 00:10:31,667
What's the matter?
Please, Velma, I'll
talk to you tomorrow.

209
00:10:31,767 --> 00:10:33,900
Can't I see how she goes
with my own wrap?
Go on now, Velma.

210
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,900
Well, have a good time
anyway, Honey!
Yeah, yeah.

211
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,967
And spill some
champagne on...
Yeah, goodbye.

212
00:10:38,067 --> 00:10:40,367
Thanks a lot.
And if he has friend,
don't forget about me.

213
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,233
I'll look terrible
in that too.

214
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,300
Wait 'til I finish
pressing your coat.

215
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,933
Well, you can put this
around your shoulders
and it will look just fine.

216
00:10:48,033 --> 00:10:50,133
Please don't
get mad, but it's...
It's just that...

217
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:52,200
Well, I resent
the whole setup.

218
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,400
Resent it?

219
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,900
Yes, right from the beginning
when that slimy little man
crawled up to me in the store

220
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,900
and wiggled
his eyebrows. It...

221
00:11:01,667 --> 00:11:03,433
It just makes me feel cheap.

222
00:11:03,533 --> 00:11:04,900
Let's face it.

223
00:11:05,067 --> 00:11:07,167
Girls like us
can't pick the way
we meet like men like...

224
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:09,133
Men like Smith Ohlrig.

225
00:11:09,233 --> 00:11:10,600
Why, you
should be grateful.

226
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,067
Well, I'm not.

227
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,400
Oh, no,

228
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,800
you want to keep
dreaming about little
ol' prince charming

229
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,067
on a golden horse.

230
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,867
You feel cheap.

231
00:11:18,967 --> 00:11:21,067
Well, that's touching.

232
00:11:21,167 --> 00:11:22,533
Now, let me tell you,

233
00:11:22,633 --> 00:11:25,533
I'd be very glad,
believe me, to be
in your shoes.

234
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,900
For Pete's sake,

235
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:32,900
here you are with a chance
to meet some decent men.

236
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,833
Men that could take you out
of living in dump like this.

237
00:11:37,267 --> 00:11:38,267
You...

238
00:11:39,667 --> 00:11:42,367
Oh, you don't know
a break when you get it.

239
00:11:46,567 --> 00:11:47,733
(WATER LAPPING)

240
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,100
(APPROACHING MOTOR)

241
00:12:11,533 --> 00:12:12,933
(MOTOR CUTS)

242
00:12:20,933 --> 00:12:23,333
Are you from
the Ohlrig yacht?
MAN: That's right.

243
00:12:23,433 --> 00:12:26,833
Oh, thank goodness.
I thought they'd never send
somebody to pick me up.

244
00:12:26,933 --> 00:12:28,733
They didn't send me.
Oh.

245
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:30,600
I have some business
to take care of.

246
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,100
Well, couldn't
you take me
to the yacht first?

247
00:12:34,567 --> 00:12:36,733
Don't say yacht,
say boat.

248
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,900
Boat, then.
Couldn't you, please?

249
00:12:39,067 --> 00:12:41,933
It's not a very good
party. In fact, it's one
of the dullest they've had.

250
00:12:42,067 --> 00:12:44,267
Oh, I don't care,
I've got to get there.

251
00:12:44,367 --> 00:12:45,400
Why?

252
00:12:45,967 --> 00:12:47,067
Well, because...

253
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,400
Oh, I don't think that's
any of your concern.

254
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,767
Well, if you're in
such a hurry, why didn't
you come with the others?

255
00:12:51,867 --> 00:12:54,100
Well, I couldn't
get off work in time.

256
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,567
I'm a model.

257
00:12:55,667 --> 00:12:59,500
I phoned Mr. Kartos
before he arrived, but

258
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,767
he said he'd send a taxi
out and then somebody
would pick me up.

259
00:13:02,867 --> 00:13:05,700
If you want to wait 'til
I finish my business,
I'll take you out.

260
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,933
You couldn't
take me now?

261
00:13:07,067 --> 00:13:08,367
No.

262
00:13:08,467 --> 00:13:11,567
Well, in that case
I'll just have to wait
'til you're ready then.

263
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,300
Come on.

264
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,467
Where?

265
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,067
Come drive
to the office with me.

266
00:13:18,133 --> 00:13:20,600
Oh, I couldn't
do that.
Why not?

267
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,800
Well, in the first
place, I don't know
who you are,

268
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,467
except that you
say you're from
the Ohlrig yacht,

269
00:13:25,567 --> 00:13:29,400
and in the second place,
I owe that taxi driver $6.50

270
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,667
which Mr. Kartos said...
I'll take care of him.

271
00:13:34,467 --> 00:13:37,067
My name is Leonora Eames,
what's yours?

272
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:38,300
Smith Ohlrig.

273
00:13:45,167 --> 00:13:47,367
MAN: Well, it can't be done
that way, Mr. Ohlrig,

274
00:13:47,467 --> 00:13:48,600
but if you're
willing to spend...

275
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,300
SMITH OHLRIG: I do not make
money by throwing it away.

276
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,733
Good night.
Good night.

277
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:55,300
Goodbye, Mr. Ohlrig.
Good night.

278
00:13:57,267 --> 00:13:59,067
Sorry, it had to be
so long, but I'm
trying to set up

279
00:13:59,133 --> 00:14:00,467
a new organization here.

280
00:14:00,567 --> 00:14:02,200
Oh, that's
perfectly all right,

281
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,300
I was having
a delightful catnap.

282
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,733
(SHIP HORN)

283
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:10,767
There's so many people
on the boat, do you mind
if we drive back to town?

284
00:14:10,867 --> 00:14:12,400
Oh, not at all, Mr. Ohlrig.

285
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,600
I'd love to.
Well, that's fine.

286
00:14:31,467 --> 00:14:33,067
(CHUCKLES)

287
00:14:33,167 --> 00:14:36,333
I don't see what's so funny
about learning how to walk
with a book on your head.

288
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,133
I'm sorry.

289
00:14:38,233 --> 00:14:40,067
What did you
say the name
of that place was?

290
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,533
Dorothy Dale
School of Charm.
(SNICKERS)

291
00:14:42,633 --> 00:14:45,533
It's quite famous. It is!

292
00:14:45,633 --> 00:14:47,633
I wish you wouldn't
drive so fast.

293
00:14:47,733 --> 00:14:50,133
I like it, and I'm
a good driver.

294
00:14:50,233 --> 00:14:51,667
I'm sure you are but...

295
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:53,933
Didn't your Charm
School teach you to be
agreeable to your escort?

296
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,367
Yes.

297
00:14:58,467 --> 00:15:00,300
What else did
they teach you?

298
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,867
Oh, diction and make-up
and fencing.

299
00:15:02,967 --> 00:15:04,433
Mr. Devough taught that.

300
00:15:04,533 --> 00:15:06,400
And posture
and social usage.

301
00:15:07,167 --> 00:15:08,233
Social what?

302
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,067
Usage, you know.

303
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,100
Conversation etiquette,
how to pour tea,

304
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,633
how to listen
to music, how to...

305
00:15:14,733 --> 00:15:16,267
Please watch the road.

306
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,067
Mmm-hmm.

307
00:15:21,867 --> 00:15:23,233
Where are you from?

308
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:24,433
Denver.

309
00:15:24,533 --> 00:15:26,100
Family poor?
Yes.

310
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,733
How long have you
been in Los Angeles?

311
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:29,700
Almost five years.
Doing what?

312
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,767
Working.

313
00:15:30,867 --> 00:15:31,833
Who paid...
Modeling.

314
00:15:31,933 --> 00:15:35,300
Who paid for
your charm school?
I did.

315
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,700
How many weekend
yachting trips
have you been on?

316
00:15:38,067 --> 00:15:39,100
None.

317
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,067
All right, how many
Hollywood parties then?
None.

318
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,867
Come on.
I haven't!

319
00:15:43,967 --> 00:15:46,533
Why not?
Nobody else asked me.

320
00:15:46,633 --> 00:15:49,833
There's some cigarettes
in the glove compartment,
light one for me.

321
00:15:51,633 --> 00:15:53,733
What do you
know about me?

322
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,433
Oh, uh...

323
00:15:55,533 --> 00:15:57,800
I know you're
from the east.
New York.

324
00:15:59,867 --> 00:16:01,067
And I know you're
sort of a...

325
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:03,400
Of an
international something.

326
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,567
Well, that just about
describes it.

327
00:16:09,433 --> 00:16:11,067
What else?

328
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,067
And you're rich.

329
00:16:13,133 --> 00:16:15,567
How rich?
Oh, very rich.

330
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,767
(EXHALES)
What else?

331
00:16:18,867 --> 00:16:21,233
Well, I know that
you've never been
married before.

332
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:24,467
And I'm not
going to be either.

333
00:16:59,467 --> 00:17:00,767
Where are we?

334
00:17:00,867 --> 00:17:02,833
At the house,
my house.

335
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,267
No.

336
00:17:07,367 --> 00:17:08,900
Come in and have a drink.

337
00:17:12,133 --> 00:17:15,300
Don't be a silly girl,
you knew you weren't
just taking a drive.

338
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,367
Please take me home,
Mr. Ohlrig.

339
00:17:19,067 --> 00:17:20,833
Come on, don't you
think I like you?

340
00:17:23,067 --> 00:17:25,167
Take me home.

341
00:17:25,267 --> 00:17:28,067
Didn't the charm
school tell you
how to handle this?

342
00:17:29,067 --> 00:17:30,567
I'm sorry.

343
00:17:32,067 --> 00:17:33,567
I just want to go home.

344
00:17:33,667 --> 00:17:34,933
Skip it.

345
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:48,867
OHLRIG: I took her home
and we said good night.

346
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:51,400
That happens three
or four more times
and then I dropped her.

347
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,967
Why?

348
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,500
They come a dime a dozen.

349
00:17:56,633 --> 00:17:59,367
I thought from
what you said before that

350
00:17:59,467 --> 00:18:02,767
she was sweeter
than most of the girls.

351
00:18:02,867 --> 00:18:06,067
Psychoanalysts
and elephants,
they never forget.

352
00:18:07,433 --> 00:18:10,067
Oh, I think this is
all pointless anyway.

353
00:18:10,167 --> 00:18:11,867
Well, why did you
come here?

354
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:13,633
'Cause I don't like
getting upset so easily

355
00:18:13,733 --> 00:18:15,433
and you're supposed
to be able to calm me.

356
00:18:15,533 --> 00:18:18,633
I can, if you'll work
with me, not against me.

357
00:18:19,633 --> 00:18:22,367
Let's go back to the girl.

358
00:18:22,467 --> 00:18:26,500
Well, for your information,
she's after precisely the
same thing everyone's after,

359
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,933
my money.

360
00:18:28,067 --> 00:18:31,433
Well, maybe the girl
feels that you just want
to play around with her.

361
00:18:31,533 --> 00:18:34,567
Well, she's right if she
does. You don't think I
want to marry her, do you?

362
00:18:34,667 --> 00:18:36,867
I certainly hope not.

363
00:18:36,967 --> 00:18:39,500
If I persisted long enough,
I could get where I want.

364
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,067
I wish business
were as easy.

365
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,167
Yesterday, I had
to battle with some
grubby little man

366
00:18:43,267 --> 00:18:44,967
from noon until
2:00 in the morning,

367
00:18:45,067 --> 00:18:47,133
and I had one of those
idiotic attacks.

368
00:18:47,233 --> 00:18:48,500
A heart attack?

369
00:18:49,467 --> 00:18:52,333
Yes, and I go to
a specialist for that.

370
00:18:52,433 --> 00:18:55,700
I think they're just
a nervous reaction.

371
00:18:55,800 --> 00:19:00,067
About a year ago,
you wanted to buy
out a rubber company

372
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:04,067
and the owner didn't
want to sell.
So you had an attack.

373
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,567
The next one occurred
in that South American...
I get it.

374
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:08,733
I get the connection.

375
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:10,967
Whenever I can't
get what I want,
I have an attack,

376
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:12,400
is that your theory?

377
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,867
Yes. There's nothing
organically wrong
with your heart,

378
00:19:15,967 --> 00:19:17,833
so why the attacks?

379
00:19:17,933 --> 00:19:21,167
Well, let's consider whether
it's just a way of saying,

380
00:19:21,267 --> 00:19:24,533
"I'm not all-powerful,
I'm weak,"

381
00:19:24,633 --> 00:19:27,167
"take pity, give me
what I want."

382
00:19:31,367 --> 00:19:34,300
I have these
attacks because
I have a bad heart,

383
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,400
but that's too
simple for you.

384
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,800
You have to find some
insane Freudian reason.

385
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,300
Heart attacks
because I want pity.

386
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,433
And what are some of
your other little gems?

387
00:19:44,533 --> 00:19:46,733
I must destroy
everyone I can't own?

388
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:48,800
I'm afraid all anyone
wants is my money?

389
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:49,867
Well, it...
I'll never marry

390
00:19:49,967 --> 00:19:51,433
because I'd only
be married for my money?

391
00:19:51,533 --> 00:19:52,733
I didn't...
Don't say you
didn't say that

392
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:53,867
because you did,
admit it.

393
00:19:53,967 --> 00:19:55,733
I only said that...
Well, you're
wrong, Doctor,

394
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,567
dead wrong. I am
going to get married.

395
00:19:58,267 --> 00:20:00,700
I'm not afraid of anyone.

396
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,167
And what's more, you
want to know something?
(DIALING)

397
00:20:03,267 --> 00:20:05,000
I'm going to
marry that girl.

398
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,967
You don't
believe me, do you?

399
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:11,933
Hello, Franzi?

400
00:20:12,033 --> 00:20:14,333
We're taking a plane
to Yuma as soon as
you can get a hold of,

401
00:20:14,433 --> 00:20:17,333
uh, Leonora...
Uh, what's her name?

402
00:20:17,433 --> 00:20:18,767
Yes, Eames.

403
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,333
Why do you think?

404
00:20:21,433 --> 00:20:23,333
I'm going to get married.

405
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,367
Sorry to cut off
a major source of
your income, Doctor,

406
00:20:27,467 --> 00:20:29,300
but you won't
see me again.

407
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,033
It's up to you.
Completely.

408
00:20:32,067 --> 00:20:33,800
And I do as I please.

409
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,033
Yes, that's why
you made your call.

410
00:20:37,133 --> 00:20:39,333
I said I didn't think
you'd marry,

411
00:20:39,433 --> 00:20:42,800
and so you've made
arrangements
to prove I'm wrong.

412
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:46,033
You don't really
want to marry this girl.

413
00:20:46,133 --> 00:20:49,367
You've only done this
because you're angry at me,

414
00:20:49,467 --> 00:20:53,167
and to prove
that no one has
authority over you.

415
00:20:53,267 --> 00:20:57,033
A marriage like this
will only ruin
the girl, and you.

416
00:20:59,367 --> 00:21:00,600
That's your opinion.

417
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,100
Beg pardon, Madam,
luncheon is ready.

418
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,700
Oh, thank you.

419
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,533
But, do you mean
he actually doesn't
get home until midnight?

420
00:21:46,633 --> 00:21:47,900
Sometimes even later.

421
00:21:48,067 --> 00:21:49,833
What do you do, wait up
and polish your jewelry?
Thank you.

422
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,500
Oh, they look so
good, I'll take two.

423
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,700
Well, I usually pick him
up at whatever warehouse
or office he's at.

424
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,067
Yes please. Warehouse?
Uh-huh. What then?
No, thank you.

425
00:21:58,167 --> 00:22:01,533
What then? Oh, then
we drive to the beach
or some little joint.

426
00:22:01,633 --> 00:22:04,167
Money and romance,
lucky girl.
No, thanks.

427
00:22:04,267 --> 00:22:07,433
Yes, except that Franzi
or one of the other men
is always along.

428
00:22:07,533 --> 00:22:08,600
Sounds cozy.

429
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,533
Well, he's just
there, I guess.

430
00:22:11,633 --> 00:22:13,900
Altogether, we're
a very cozy couple.

431
00:22:14,067 --> 00:22:15,667
What's the matter, Hon?

432
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:17,400
Oh, I just think that

433
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,367
Smith wishes that
he hadn't married me.

434
00:22:20,467 --> 00:22:22,900
Oh, the minute
you get rich,
you get neurotic.

435
00:22:23,067 --> 00:22:24,533
No, but I mean it.

436
00:22:24,633 --> 00:22:25,967
I don't blame him.

437
00:22:26,067 --> 00:22:29,600
I don't know how to
fit in to all of this
or how to behave.

438
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,500
Enjoy it, that's how.

439
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,467
And I'm sure he thinks
that I married him
for his money.

440
00:22:34,567 --> 00:22:35,933
No comment.

441
00:22:37,667 --> 00:22:39,367
You know I didn't.

442
00:22:39,467 --> 00:22:41,300
I could never
do a thing like that.

443
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,967
You really love him,
don't you?

444
00:22:43,067 --> 00:22:44,167
Yes.

445
00:22:44,267 --> 00:22:46,067
May I have
the butter, please?

446
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:49,700
Now, look, so everything
isn't billing and cooing.

447
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,767
So you didn't have
a honeymoon, so you
don't see him alone.

448
00:22:51,867 --> 00:22:52,967
When you get
married, you want...

449
00:22:53,067 --> 00:22:54,900
So you think this
and he thinks that,
who cares?

450
00:22:55,067 --> 00:22:56,433
Look at that house!

451
00:22:56,533 --> 00:22:58,567
Look at the charge
account, look at us!

452
00:22:58,667 --> 00:23:00,233
Lunch by
the swimming pool,

453
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:02,933
and look at this
silver and this glass,

454
00:23:03,067 --> 00:23:04,467
look at this table.

455
00:23:04,567 --> 00:23:06,267
Oh, honey, you're rich.

456
00:23:07,067 --> 00:23:09,633
Yeah, rich but...
(SIGHS)

457
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,433
Things will be better
in New York.

458
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,933
The house is
on Long Island.

459
00:23:19,633 --> 00:23:20,933
Same difference.

460
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,167
(PIANO PLAYING)

461
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,367
(HUMMING)

462
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,800
Franzi, will you
please stop playing?
(MUSIC STOPS)

463
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,833
(MUSIC STARTS)
FRANZI: Just this one,
darling, it's so lovely.

FRANZI: (HUMMING)

465
00:23:56,333 --> 00:23:59,067
I wish I could
go to bed.
So do I.

466
00:24:04,167 --> 00:24:06,667
It's almost 3:00, Franzi.

467
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,067
Tough, take a pill.

468
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,933
I've lived on pills
ever since I came east.

469
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,500
That's 10 months.

470
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,967
I won't anymore.

471
00:24:20,467 --> 00:24:23,233
Then play with the
necklace he gave you
for your anniversary.

472
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,867
Yes,

473
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,300
instead of that honeymoon trip
we'll never take.

474
00:24:30,767 --> 00:24:33,467
Instead of going to
Denver to see my family,

475
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,633
instead of having
dinner together,

476
00:24:37,733 --> 00:24:41,467
spending time together,
and being together like
other married people.

477
00:24:46,567 --> 00:24:48,933
No.

478
00:24:49,067 --> 00:24:53,067
All he wants me to do
is sit here and wait until
he phones or comes home.

479
00:24:54,067 --> 00:24:56,367
And I see him exactly
for one hour.

480
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,833
Two if I'm lucky.

481
00:24:58,933 --> 00:25:02,967
FRANZI: Tough, you got
what you wanted, darling,
you're wearing it.

482
00:25:03,067 --> 00:25:06,967
You mustn't expect
him to pick up your
handkerchief too.

483
00:25:07,067 --> 00:25:10,600
Maybe money is
enough for you.
Of course, isn't it for you?

484
00:25:12,233 --> 00:25:13,733
No.

485
00:25:13,833 --> 00:25:16,133
Why else marry
a madman like that?

486
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,300
But he wasn't like this
before we were married.

487
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,967
He was a bachelor.

488
00:25:22,067 --> 00:25:24,100
He was a human being.

489
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,100
Tough, buy yourself
a new hat.

490
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,500
Tough, darling, tough.

Will you stop saying that?

492

(SHOUTING)
Will you stop playing
that piano? Will you stop?

493
00:25:38,167 --> 00:25:40,933
You know, you're
a greedy little
girl, darling,

494
00:25:41,067 --> 00:25:43,467
and you're getting
greedier every day.

495
00:25:43,567 --> 00:25:44,833
This part is divine.

496

(UNDER BREATH)
Greedy?

497
00:25:46,567 --> 00:25:48,567
How dare you. Greedy?

it at...

No!

I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it, I'm...

501
00:25:55,167 --> 00:25:57,067
It's all right.
I'm sorry.

502
00:25:57,133 --> 00:25:59,133
It saves him
from getting hit.

My comb, Franz.

It's all right.
I think I have it...
Here it is, darling.

I'm sorry, Franz.
No, it's all right.

Good morning,

Good morning.

Good morning,

No.
You look done in.

You know where
the projection room is?
Sure, Mr. Ohlrig.

We'll start right away.

comfortable, boys.

Help yourselves
to a drink.

524
00:26:57,233 --> 00:26:59,267
You got any food?
Well, there's
some sandwiches...

525
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:00,767
Nothing hot?

I'm sorry.
It's all right.

anything to eat,
just ask Mrs. Ohlrig.

Well, I... I thought
you'd be alone.

There's so many men,
well, I think

so funny, Leonora?

Nothing.

543
00:28:08,533 --> 00:28:10,967
Well, I'm glad you can get
a laugh out of me, I'd just
like to know what it was.

00:28:12,267 --> 00:28:14,367
I wasn't laughing
at you, Smith.

It wasn't anything
in the picture.

so funny then?

I'm sorry, I'm afraid
it was something I said.

No.
Something private, then.

you meant to,

You thought if you
had enough money,
you'd have everything.

Well, it's not
that easy.

The world is clammy
with people who think
that way and they sicken me.

I was born rich. My father
left me four million dollars,

I didn't gamble it away,
I didn't marry it away.

22 and a half times

that much before I die.

wants, isn't it?
Well I've got it,

00:31:47,167 --> 00:31:49,500
Every one of my corporations,
every single one

606
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,933

a different lawyer,
a different accountant.

Not one of them
knows anything
about each other.

I run it all.

and he stays there,
and why not?

They're well paid,

and that's what you've
got to learn, Leonora.

You're better paid
than any of them

613
00:32:04,967 --> 00:32:07,333
and you've got your
place, this house.

614
00:32:08,767 --> 00:32:10,667
And that's where
you'll stay.

00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,533
But you want more,
don't you?

Yes, I want
more of you.

Are you bored?

Do you tire of money
so easily that
you're bored?

Oh, Smith,
I just meant that...

620
00:32:26,467 --> 00:32:27,967
I can't, I...

621
00:32:28,067 --> 00:32:29,467
Go away then, take a trip.

622
00:32:29,567 --> 00:32:32,233
Go to Palm Beach,
Sun Valley, go anywhere,

You should anyway,

624
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,667
there's still some
of that charm school
paint sticking to you

625
00:32:36,767 --> 00:32:38,067
that needs scrapping off.

626
00:32:40,067 --> 00:32:42,233
Well, I guess that's
all there is to do.

627
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,800
Go away, I mean.

I'm going to get a job.

in the factory, Mrs. Ohlrig?

Honestly.

The work isn't
very hard, you said
yourself it wasn't,

759
00:38:59,367 --> 00:39:01,467
and I can
answer telephones
and keep records.

00:39:01,567 --> 00:39:02,867
And type?
I'll practice...

speak too quickly I could
take it down in longhand.

you start now,

00:39:28,267 --> 00:39:29,767
Well, I might as well.

773
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,400
Start, I mean.
Okay.

774
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,300
If that's all right with you.
Sure, that's fine.
I'll get Miss Murray

775
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,500
to show you around.
I'll wait for her
out there.

776
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,767
All right.

777
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:39,600
Thank you very much.
Goodbye. I mean...

778
00:39:41,333 --> 00:39:42,567
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

779
00:39:42,667 --> 00:39:45,500
Good afternoon, Dr. Quinada
and Dr. Hoffman's office.

780
00:39:46,233 --> 00:39:47,800
Yes? Oh,
hello, Dr. Hoffman.

781
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,267
Will you hold on, please?
Any calls, Le?

782
00:39:49,367 --> 00:39:52,833
Yes, there was one from...
Mrs. Palmer called,

783
00:39:52,933 --> 00:39:55,433
and Mrs. Burnstein's
in your office
with Miss Murray.

784
00:39:55,533 --> 00:39:57,267
Oh, thanks. Say, Le,

785
00:39:57,367 --> 00:39:59,167
would you mind
calling her Burnstein?

786
00:39:59,267 --> 00:40:01,167
She said she never knows
who you're talking about.

787
00:40:01,267 --> 00:40:03,433
Oh, I'm sorry, Doctor.
(LAUGHING)
It's no tragedy,

788
00:40:03,533 --> 00:40:06,500
these days, nobody knows
what anybody else's
talking about anyway.

789
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,900
What a world.

790
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,467
Well, Mrs. Burnstein,
seems like you're
looking fine today.

791
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,200
Hello? Yes...
DR. QUINADA: If you worried
more about her stomach

792
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,433
and less about this other
nonsense, the child
Yes, I will.

793
00:40:16,533 --> 00:40:18,233
Would be a great
deal better for it.
Now, you take her home,

794
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:19,967
I don't want to hear
anymore about it.
Yes, Doctor, I will.

795
00:40:20,067 --> 00:40:22,900
Goodbye.
Come on, girl,
pick your feet up.

796
00:40:24,233 --> 00:40:25,433
DR. QUINADA: Now,
Mrs. Rudecki,

797
00:40:25,533 --> 00:40:27,933
don't forget to be back here
at 7:30 with your husband.

798
00:40:28,033 --> 00:40:29,633
Yes, doctor, I will.

799
00:40:29,733 --> 00:40:31,667
Some doctor he is!

800
00:40:31,767 --> 00:40:33,300
He's a very good doctor.

801
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,933
I think you better
come in, Miss Eames.

802
00:40:35,033 --> 00:40:36,300
Yes, sir.

803
00:40:45,633 --> 00:40:48,167
Do you often chat
with Mrs. Rudecki
and the other mothers?

804
00:40:48,267 --> 00:40:50,300
No, not often.

805
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,167
Did you suggest to
Mrs. Rudecki that she give
Lorraine elocution lessons?

806
00:40:54,833 --> 00:40:56,433
Yes.
Why?

807
00:40:56,533 --> 00:40:58,733
Well, Mr. Rudecki has
a thick foreign accent,

808
00:40:58,833 --> 00:41:00,133
and Mrs. Rudecki is
afraid that they might...

809
00:41:00,233 --> 00:41:01,867
Yes, I know all
about that, but wasn't
it some other reason,

810
00:41:02,067 --> 00:41:04,500
something about if
Lorraine learned to
speak well and walk well

811
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:08,267
and do half a dozen
other things well, she'd
end up by marrying well

812
00:41:08,367 --> 00:41:10,700
and that that's
the most important
thing in a girl's life?

813
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,633
Isn't that
what you said?

814
00:41:12,733 --> 00:41:14,867
Yes, I said that.
Now, look.

815
00:41:14,967 --> 00:41:17,267
Your beliefs are your
own business until you
start pumping them

816
00:41:17,367 --> 00:41:19,267
into my patients,
then they become
my business.

817
00:41:20,367 --> 00:41:22,333
Where did you
get these ideas anyway?

818
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:26,100
Is it your burning
ambition to marry rich?

819
00:41:27,333 --> 00:41:28,733
Well, is it?

820
00:41:30,067 --> 00:41:33,400
(STAMMERING)
Is that all, Doctor?
No.

821
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,833
Do you want this
job permanently?
Yes.

822
00:41:35,933 --> 00:41:38,800
Well, you act as though
it's a temporary
stopgap for you.

823
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:42,633
Your typing, your filing,
all your desk work haven't
improved one iota

824
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:45,133
in the two weeks
you've been here.

825
00:41:45,233 --> 00:41:48,200
I'm sorry.
Well, why don't you
do something about it?

826
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:50,100
Now, I don't want
to irritate you
by bringing up

827
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,833
your personal
standards again,

828
00:41:51,933 --> 00:41:55,067
but you're letting
them slop over
into your work, Leonora.

829
00:41:55,133 --> 00:41:58,400
You're a receptionist
in a doctor's officer
on the East Side,

830
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,833
not a hostess
on Park Avenue.

831
00:42:00,933 --> 00:42:03,633
The way you treat your
patients, that way you...

832
00:42:03,733 --> 00:42:06,133
For Pete's sake,
look at that hairdo.

833
00:42:06,233 --> 00:42:09,633
You're so fancy,
you're scaring
people away.

834
00:42:09,733 --> 00:42:12,067
They may be poor,
but they're patients
and we want them.

835
00:42:12,133 --> 00:42:13,433
(TEARFULLY)
Well, you can keep them.

836
00:42:13,533 --> 00:42:16,100
If everything I do
is wrong, I might
as well quit.

837
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:18,100
(DOOR CLOSES)

838
00:42:29,667 --> 00:42:30,867
Stupid.

839
00:42:35,733 --> 00:42:36,733
Stupid.

840
00:42:37,067 --> 00:42:38,067
What?

841
00:42:38,167 --> 00:42:39,733
She's a stupid girl.

842
00:42:39,833 --> 00:42:40,900
Who?

843
00:42:41,067 --> 00:42:43,800
I criticized her work
so she got mad and quit.

844
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,067
Did she?

845
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,733
Her work was bad.

846
00:42:47,067 --> 00:42:48,067
Was it?

847
00:42:48,133 --> 00:42:49,900
The point is, she
isn't really stupid.

848
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:52,300
She could be quite good
if she wanted to be.

849
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,800
Well, put the ad
in the paper again,

850
00:42:55,867 --> 00:42:57,900
unless you want to ask
her to come back.

851
00:42:58,067 --> 00:43:00,667
I didn't fire her,
she quit.

852
00:43:00,767 --> 00:43:03,633
I don't know
what's the matter
with that girl.

853
00:43:03,733 --> 00:43:06,333
You don't suppose
there's anything
the matter with you.

854
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,567
Ridiculous.

855
00:43:15,367 --> 00:43:16,733
(KNOCKING)

856
00:43:16,833 --> 00:43:18,233
Yes, who is it?

857
00:43:19,533 --> 00:43:21,067
(KNOCKING)

858
00:43:21,467 --> 00:43:22,733
Just a minute.

859
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:23,833
(SINGLE KNOCK)

860
00:43:32,767 --> 00:43:34,067
May I come in?

861
00:43:41,067 --> 00:43:42,600
May I sit down?

862
00:43:44,633 --> 00:43:47,533
How did... How did
you know I was here?

863
00:43:47,633 --> 00:43:49,967
I had you watched
from the day you left.

864
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:53,967
I know I wouldn't
hear from you.

865
00:43:54,067 --> 00:43:56,300
I wanted to be sure
you were all right.

866
00:44:00,667 --> 00:44:04,100
It's not a very nice
way, but it's the
only way I knew.

867
00:44:05,633 --> 00:44:08,367
I guess everything turned
out as you predicted, Leonora.

868
00:44:11,067 --> 00:44:12,833
Can you hear me?

869
00:44:14,067 --> 00:44:15,300
Yes.

870
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:19,233
I've missed you.
More than I thought
I could miss anyone.

871
00:44:28,067 --> 00:44:29,300
Thanks.

872
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:32,367
I've come running
after you.

873
00:44:32,467 --> 00:44:34,733
To beg you to come
back to me.

874
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:38,733
How's doctor...
What's his name,
Quinada?

875
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,667
All right.

876
00:44:40,767 --> 00:44:42,167
He works you pretty hard,
doesn't he?

877
00:44:42,267 --> 00:44:44,067
Not as hard
as he works himself.

878
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:47,233
Where does this go?
Any place.

879
00:44:47,333 --> 00:44:49,367
It's too bad he isn't
more successful then.

880
00:44:50,733 --> 00:44:52,833
He isn't just
interested in success.

881
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:57,333
I'm sorry.
That wasn't fair.

882
00:44:58,333 --> 00:45:01,167
Truth is, I'm a little
jealous of him.

883
00:45:01,267 --> 00:45:04,867
You don't have any
reason to be, as much
as I wish you did.

884
00:45:06,767 --> 00:45:08,800
Why?

885
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:12,900
Because I'm glad
to see you
and I wish I weren't.

886
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:18,633
What are you looking for?

887
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:20,433
A cigarette.

888
00:45:20,967 --> 00:45:22,367
I have one here.

889
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:29,600
Leonora.

890
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:31,500
It's no good, Smith.
I won't go back
to the way it was.

891
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:34,067
I don't want you to.
I was wrong.
I admit it.

892
00:45:34,133 --> 00:45:36,300
No. Please, Smith, no.
It won't be that way
anymore, Leonora.

893
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,567
It won't.

894
00:45:37,667 --> 00:45:39,600
We'll make a fresh start.

895
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:43,167
We'll make everything
just the way it ought
to have been.

896
00:45:43,267 --> 00:45:45,433
I'm so used to having
my own way that...

897
00:45:46,233 --> 00:45:48,200
It was hard for me
to come here.

898
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:51,400
But I missed you
and I wanted you
so much.

899
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:54,833
I missed all the things
we ought to have done,
like, being together,

900
00:45:54,933 --> 00:45:58,533
finding new places,
having a honeymoon.

901
00:45:58,633 --> 00:46:01,567
Let's go and wander
more, Leonora.
Let's start over again.

902
00:46:03,367 --> 00:46:06,067
I can't see you
living in this
dirty, little room.

903
00:46:06,167 --> 00:46:07,567
It's not dirty, Smith.

904
00:46:07,667 --> 00:46:11,400
It's shabby.
It's awful.
Ragged.

905
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,767
Let's get out
of here, Leonora.

906
00:46:13,867 --> 00:46:16,533
Well, I don't need anything.
We'll just take a drive
or have a cup of coffee.

907
00:46:16,633 --> 00:46:19,733
I don't care.
I just can't talk
in this room.

908
00:46:19,833 --> 00:46:21,900
I'll bring you back
the moment you ask me.

909
00:46:22,067 --> 00:46:24,100
Is that a promise?
Yes.

910
00:46:25,167 --> 00:46:26,833
Turn out the light.

911
00:46:30,867 --> 00:46:32,167
(CLICKING)

912
00:46:35,533 --> 00:46:37,667
Here?
No, the other side.

913
00:46:39,467 --> 00:46:41,700
You really don't
like living here.

914
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,567
No one's poor
by choice.

915
00:46:44,667 --> 00:46:46,800
It really isn't such
a bad room.
(DOOR CLOSES)

916
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:49,333
Not if you
haven't seen better.

917
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:58,933
Darling, good morning.
Good morning, sir.

918
00:46:59,067 --> 00:47:00,700
Wait, may I relieve
you at this moment?
Oh, no.

919
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,933
I would like to serve
breakfast myself today.
Oh, no.

920
00:47:03,067 --> 00:47:04,300
Just today.
I have a special reason.

921
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,133
You can trust me.
I've done this before.
Believe me.

923
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,067
Good morning, darling.

924
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,233
Welcome home.

925
00:47:45,067 --> 00:47:46,700
What are you
doing here, Franzi?

926
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,600
I know you would be
hungry so I brought
you a lovely breakfast.

927
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,800
Three eggs, darling.

928
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:54,367
I don't wanna get up yet.
But you must.

929
00:47:54,467 --> 00:47:56,067
Smith told me
to wake you.

930
00:47:57,133 --> 00:47:58,833
He did?
FRANZI: Yes.

931
00:47:58,933 --> 00:48:00,800
We leave in an hour.

932
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:03,067
LEONORA: Who's we?
All of us, darling.

933
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:05,500
Smith, Tim, Charlie,
me, the whole crowd.

934
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,233
Where are we going?

935
00:48:08,333 --> 00:48:10,633
On a great tour of every
Ohlrig plant in the country.

936
00:48:11,133 --> 00:48:12,300
Publicity tour.

937
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,767
FRANZI: It'll be a lovely
vacation and I
certainly need one.

938
00:48:14,867 --> 00:48:19,233
Franzi.
When did Smith decide
to make this trip?

939
00:48:19,333 --> 00:48:22,133
Day before yesterday.
You got back just in time.

940
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:24,367
I always said you're
a smart little girl.

941
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:28,333
This is a lovely suit
and cap and just take
this with your mink.

942
00:48:28,433 --> 00:48:30,467
Where is the mink?
They even buy...
(INAUDIBLE)

943
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:34,400
I'm through
with that coat.
What?

944
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,200
I'm through
with that coat.

945
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:39,100
Darling, this is an
expensive thing.
You can't afford, I mean...

946
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:42,467
I can.
Dr. Quinada's
office?

947
00:48:42,567 --> 00:48:44,667
Miss Murray,
this is Leonora Eames.

948
00:48:46,067 --> 00:48:47,400
I'll wait.

949
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:50,467
Don't be stupid, Leonora.
Take this away, please.

950
00:48:50,567 --> 00:48:53,067
Look I told you,
all these once before.
Take it.

951
00:48:53,133 --> 00:48:54,400
Darling, be a darling.

952
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:56,067
All right.
All right.

953
00:48:57,333 --> 00:48:59,833
Some darlings never know
when they are well-off.

954
00:48:59,933 --> 00:49:02,800
No, but give
them time, Franzi,
and they'll find out.

955
00:49:03,567 --> 00:49:05,467
Dr. Quinada?

956
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:08,500
I'm very sorry
about yesterday
and I was wondering...

957
00:49:09,633 --> 00:49:12,167
Yes, I'd like to come
back very much.

958
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:15,600
Yes, I'll be there
as soon as I can.

959
00:49:36,333 --> 00:49:38,533
Come on.
Come on, Le, go home.
Beat it.

960
00:49:38,633 --> 00:49:39,867
Here, for tomorrow
morning.

961
00:49:39,967 --> 00:49:42,200
I wanna finish
sending these out,
the monthly bills.

962
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:45,067
Oh, why bother.
Nobody ever pays
the doctor, anyway.

963
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:47,133
(CHUCKLING)
Has Quinada left?

964
00:49:47,233 --> 00:49:49,333
Uh-uh.
He hasn't come back
from the clinic yet.

965
00:49:49,433 --> 00:49:51,633
Well, if he doesn't show
up by 9:00, you know
how to lock out.

966
00:49:51,733 --> 00:49:53,833
Sure. Goodnight.
Goodnight, Le.

967
00:49:53,933 --> 00:49:55,100
Uh...

968
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,233
Don't wait later
than 9:30, anyway.

969
00:49:57,333 --> 00:49:58,967

971
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,733
Dr. Quinada's office.

972
00:50:04,467 --> 00:50:07,200
No, not yet,
Mrs. Rudecki.

973
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:08,933
Yes, I did tell him, but...

974
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,733
Yes, I'll tell him again,
Mrs. Rudecki.

975
00:50:12,167 --> 00:50:13,333
LEONORA: Yes.

976
00:50:14,933 --> 00:50:16,400
Hello.
LEONORA: Hi.

977
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,133
LEONORA: Tired?
Beat.

978
00:50:21,233 --> 00:50:23,667
Is this becoming
a habit?
Staying overtime?

979
00:50:24,967 --> 00:50:26,633
Coffee will be ready
in a minute.

980
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:30,900
Take your coat off.

981
00:50:33,667 --> 00:50:36,767
Mrs. Rudecki phoned
again for you
to come over.

982
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:41,100
I told her this morning
there was no sense
in my coming over.

983
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,600
Well, this is the 10th time
she's called which
is a new record for her.

984
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:46,067
You know what
I'd like to do
with Lorraine

985
00:50:46,167 --> 00:50:48,600
next time she comes
into this office?

986
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:51,433
Cut off those
awful curls.

987
00:50:51,533 --> 00:50:54,433
And you know how
she could cure that
stomach trouble of hers?

988
00:50:54,533 --> 00:50:56,900
By sending her mother
to a good psychiatrist.

989
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:59,000
Any temperature?

990
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:02,700
No. She says it's normal,
but she claims
Lorraine's seeing double.

991
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,667
Seeing double?
LEONORA: Yes.

992
00:51:15,967 --> 00:51:19,200
Miss Murray's gone,
isn't she?
LEONORA: Yes.

993
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:23,600
Le, grab a taxi
and get over
to the City Drugstore.

994
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:25,067
Okay.
You know where it is?

995
00:51:25,167 --> 00:51:27,467
Yeah, I'll find it.
You have some money,
haven't you?

996
00:51:27,567 --> 00:51:28,600
(CHUCKLING)
Sure.

997
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,867
Have this filled
and look me up at
the Rudecki's right away.

998
00:51:36,967 --> 00:51:38,100
Okay.

999
00:51:39,567 --> 00:51:41,233
And hurry.
Yeah.

1000
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:52,633
(MOANING)

1001
00:51:57,467 --> 00:51:59,733
That light's a little
bright for her eyes.

1002
00:51:59,833 --> 00:52:01,667
Find something
to shade it with.

1003
00:52:12,467 --> 00:52:15,267
I'm afraid
it's botulism.
Botulism?

1004
00:52:15,367 --> 00:52:18,500
Yeah, that's a doctor's
fancy word for a very
bad kind of food poisoning.

1009
00:52:28,067 --> 00:52:29,367
Will she get all right?

1010
00:52:30,767 --> 00:52:33,933
I don't know.
I think so, but
I don't know for sure.

1011
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:35,700
You're so busy telling
me I'm sick,

1012
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,433
but you haven't
got time to come
and see for yourself.

1013
00:52:37,533 --> 00:52:38,733
Can you just
keep quiet, please?

1014
00:52:38,833 --> 00:52:40,733
That canned meat that
she had this morning

1015
00:52:40,833 --> 00:52:42,067
must have been
the cause of the trouble.

1016
00:52:42,133 --> 00:52:43,133
Anyone else eat it?

No.

Kitchen window.

1020
00:52:52,867 --> 00:52:54,900
Why did you open
the can, you fool?

1021
00:52:55,067 --> 00:52:56,500
You were not
supposed to open.

1022
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,533
(ARGUING)

1023
00:53:04,067 --> 00:53:07,333
I'll give her another
injection every six hours
until it takes effect.

1024
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:14,567
If it takes effect.
It will.

1025
00:53:14,667 --> 00:53:17,167
Even when you
treat cases like
this immediately,

1026
00:53:17,267 --> 00:53:19,900
18% of those treated die.

1027
00:53:20,067 --> 00:53:23,167
I know all the statistics.
I'm a very good
textbook doctor.

1028
00:53:23,267 --> 00:53:24,767
What's the matter, Quinada?

1029
00:53:24,867 --> 00:53:26,200
I slipped up.

1030
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:28,200
Just because Lorraine's
always had stomach trouble,

1031
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:29,833
I assumed that's what
it was this time.

1032
00:53:29,933 --> 00:53:31,667
A doctor has no
right to assume.

1033

Anyone can make
a mistake.

1034

Not when it comes
to a kid's life.

1035
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:38,067
I should have come
straight over this morning
instead of being such a...

1036
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,800
What are you doing?

1037
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:45,067
Well, you were shouting
a little and I didn't want
the Rudecki's to hear it.

1038
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:47,700
Good idea.

1039
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:51,067
You know, you might
just as well go home.
It's after 1:00.

1040
00:53:51,667 --> 00:53:53,333
No, no, I'll stay.

1041
00:53:54,067 --> 00:53:55,500
Okay.

1042
00:53:57,433 --> 00:53:59,067
LARRY: Well, I'll be back
here about noon.

1043
00:53:59,133 --> 00:54:00,700
To give her another
injection, all right?

1044
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,400
Thank you, doctor.
Thank you.
Thank you, doctor.

Uh-uh, not a bit.

up all night.

1047
00:54:12,867 --> 00:54:14,833
LARRY: You wait
'til about 9:00.

1048
00:54:15,633 --> 00:54:17,467
That's when it
catches up on you.

1049
00:54:19,067 --> 00:54:21,600
Aren't you cold?
No.

1050
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:24,567
Why did you wear
that ridiculous coat?
Don't you wanna be warm?

1051
00:54:24,667 --> 00:54:27,567
I thought it was going
to rain yesterday.
You must be freezing.

1052
00:54:29,067 --> 00:54:31,433
How much would it cost
to buy you a warm coat?

1053
00:54:31,533 --> 00:54:32,933
Oh, no, please.

1054
00:54:33,067 --> 00:54:35,233
Now, look, Rudecki
has just paid me
for the last two months.

1055
00:54:35,333 --> 00:54:37,367
I don't need
an overcoat.
I got one.

Oh, it's very nice
of you but...

1057
00:54:40,233 --> 00:54:42,100
All right.

1058
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:44,100
You go home
and get some sleep.

1059
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:47,733
I'm going home to take
a bath, but I'm coming
back to work.

What do you think I am,

00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:57,500
Don't you ever go home?

too early to be sure.

1068

(CHUCKLING)
That's a silly question.

1069

How long will
a lab report take?

1070

Well, if you went over
there now yourself,
(SIGHING)

1071
00:56:36,967 --> 00:56:39,400
they'd probably
let you know first thing
tomorrow morning.

1072
00:56:39,833 --> 00:56:41,567
Can I just go?

00:56:41,667 --> 00:56:44,300
I'll call and tell them
you're coming if you like.
Please.

1074
00:56:52,533 --> 00:56:53,600
I...

1075
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,367
You won't say anything.

1076
00:56:56,467 --> 00:56:58,700
To Quinada?
Yes.

1077
00:56:59,567 --> 00:57:01,367
No.
(CHUCKLING)

1078
00:57:01,467 --> 00:57:04,967
It's none of my
business, Le, but don't
you think that you should?

1079
00:57:08,067 --> 00:57:09,600
I...
I couldn't.

1080
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:11,600
DR. HOFFMAN: He's really
a marvelous fellow.

1081
00:57:13,067 --> 00:57:14,600
I know, but...

1082
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,100
It's too much of a mess.

1083
00:57:18,067 --> 00:57:19,200
DR. HOFFMAN: Okay.

1084
00:57:21,067 --> 00:57:22,500
Anyway, thanks.

1085
00:57:27,433 --> 00:57:29,433
MISS MURRAY: I must say
you don't look it.

1086
00:57:29,533 --> 00:57:30,933
Look what?

1087
00:57:31,833 --> 00:57:33,367
Well, you've been up
all night.

1088
00:57:33,467 --> 00:57:35,967
Mrs. Rudecki just
phoned and told me
about the seizure.

1089
00:57:36,067 --> 00:57:38,400
Good morning, Doctor.
Good morning,
Miss Murray.

1090
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:40,533
Good morning.
Good morning.

1091
00:57:40,633 --> 00:57:42,433
Good morning,
Mrs...

1092
00:57:44,167 --> 00:57:46,267
Where are you going?

1093
00:57:46,367 --> 00:57:49,533
I think I better get some
sleep. It's catching
up with me.

1094
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:56,267
Le?

1095
00:58:02,067 --> 00:58:04,100
I know you'd
rather freeze, but...

1096
00:58:06,067 --> 00:58:07,633
Will you try it on?

1097
00:58:09,233 --> 00:58:12,167
It's not mink, but
it will keep you warm.
That's the main thing.

1098
00:58:13,233 --> 00:58:14,367
It fits.

1099
00:58:15,833 --> 00:58:18,333
It doesn't look bad.
Turn around.
Let's see the front.

1100
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:23,833
Now, Leonora.

1101
00:58:23,933 --> 00:58:25,333
(SNIFFLING)

1102
00:58:25,433 --> 00:58:26,633
Don't do that.

1103
00:58:27,733 --> 00:58:28,967
I'm sorry.

1104
00:58:29,933 --> 00:58:31,267
Thank you.

1105
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:35,567
We still have
our date tonight?

1106
00:58:52,133 --> 00:58:53,667
(CLAPPING)

1107
00:58:57,633 --> 00:59:00,100
(PIANO PLAYING)

1108
00:59:01,067 --> 00:59:03,067
I was mad at you
that day.

1109
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:07,667
Did I ever apologize
for bawling you
out so badly?

1110
00:59:07,767 --> 00:59:10,200
And what made
you think of that?

1111
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:14,300
Was that because
of the way I talked
about marrying rich?

1112
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:17,600
It always makes me
see red when
people talk that way.

1113
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:20,067
My parents
made themselves
absolutely miserable

1114
00:59:20,167 --> 00:59:23,100
by having an exaggerated
idea about the importance
of money.

1115
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,367
Got a light, sweetie?
Sure.

1116
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:30,900
By the time I came along,
they'd lost most of it.

1117
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:32,700
Muchas Gracias.

1118
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:37,167
Your hair looks
good that way.
Thank you.

1119
00:59:37,267 --> 00:59:38,733
You look very lovely.

1120
00:59:40,233 --> 00:59:42,067
Is something
worrying you?

1121
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:44,633
No, I'm very happy.

1122
00:59:44,733 --> 00:59:46,567
Go on about your parents.

1123
00:59:46,667 --> 00:59:51,133
Oh, they just wasted
their lives pretending
to be rich,

1124
00:59:51,233 --> 00:59:55,333
conniving and finagling,
never working, of course.

1125
00:59:56,133 --> 00:59:59,167
Thanks, sweetie.
Oh, thank you.

1126
00:59:59,267 --> 01:00:02,333
This isn't mine.
What?
Don't you want it?

1127
01:00:02,433 --> 01:00:05,667
No, thank you.
Well, muchas gracias.

1128
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:11,400
I can't imagine you
pretending to be rich
or pretending anything.

1129
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:14,400
Oh, I did for a while
until I pulled out of it.

1130
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:16,733
Two more, sir?
No, we're fine.
Thank you.

1131
01:00:16,833 --> 01:00:18,933
Unless...
Oh, no.
Thank you.

1132
01:00:20,267 --> 01:00:24,400
Larry, was it
very difficult?
No.

1133
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:26,867
That's because you
don't care about money.

1134
01:00:26,967 --> 01:00:29,533
One has got to care
about money
to a certain extent.

1135
01:00:29,633 --> 01:00:32,500
How else could I take
you out to the dinner
when I want to?

1136
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:35,400
Well, I care more
about others things
like...

1137
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:38,233
Doing the kind of work
that interests me.

1138
01:00:38,333 --> 01:00:40,833
Is that why you work
in the East Side?
Sure.

1139
01:00:40,933 --> 01:00:42,933
I can learn more
of there in one day

1140
01:00:43,033 --> 01:00:44,867
than I can learn any
place else in a month.

1141
01:00:44,967 --> 01:00:48,400
All right, sweetie.
Let's go.
I beg your pardon?

1142
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:52,433
What?
Perfectly okay.

1143
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:55,700
Buenas noches.
Buenas noches.

1144
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:57,300
(CHUCKLING)

1145
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:00,733
That's a wonderful
smile you've got.
Charming.

1146
01:01:00,833 --> 01:01:02,267
What?

1147
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:05,333
Nothing.
I was just remembering
something.

1148
01:01:05,433 --> 01:01:08,100
I wish I could remember
where I saw you before.

1149
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:09,800
I don't think
you ever did.

1150
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:12,067
Didn't you ever
come into town
from Long Island?

1151
01:01:12,167 --> 01:01:13,967
No.
Hardly ever.

1152
01:01:14,067 --> 01:01:16,067
What were you
doing there?

1153
01:01:16,167 --> 01:01:20,767
Oh, I was sort of a paid
companion to somebody
who was very rich.

1154
01:01:22,133 --> 01:01:25,067
Let's dance.
All right.
I'm not very good.

1155
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:27,167
Oh, we don't have to.
Oh, I'd like to
if you would.

1156
01:01:27,267 --> 01:01:29,200
I haven't danced in ages.
Perhaps, you'd rather not.

1157
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:30,667
No, not unless
you would.

1158
01:01:30,767 --> 01:01:32,867
Well, I'm just as happy
sitting here, but I just...
Oh, so am I.

1159
01:01:32,967 --> 01:01:35,167
Oh, come on.
Let's dance.
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

1160
01:01:55,233 --> 01:01:57,767
Oh, I'm sorry.
I stepped on your foot.
You didn't.

1161
01:01:57,867 --> 01:02:01,567
(GIGGLING)
Good. It's probably
somebody else's.

1162
01:02:01,667 --> 01:02:05,067
This public dancing
is quite an invention.
You can get away with murder.

1163
01:02:05,133 --> 01:02:06,467
(GIGGLING)

1164
01:02:16,667 --> 01:02:19,100
I'm having
a wonderful time.
(CHUCKLING)

1165
01:02:20,467 --> 01:02:22,767
Oops.
(LAUGHING)

1166
01:02:26,433 --> 01:02:28,567
We ought to have
done this ages ago.

1167
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:38,900
Why don't we go out
again on Saturday?

1168
01:02:39,067 --> 01:02:40,800
And then spend
Sunday together?

1169
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:42,933
And Monday too.
Sure.

1170
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:45,433
And Tuesday.

1171
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:05,733
And we can go dancing
again Saturday night.

1172
01:03:07,633 --> 01:03:10,467
And then spend
Sunday again.

1173
01:03:10,567 --> 01:03:12,867
You know, it would be
much simpler
if we were married

1174
01:03:14,233 --> 01:03:16,667
and we wouldn't
have to make dates.

1175
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:21,767
Did you hear
what I said?
Yes.

1176
01:03:22,867 --> 01:03:26,100
I was proposing.
You weren't.

1177
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:27,633
Sure.
Why not?

1178
01:03:28,467 --> 01:03:30,867
Larry, I...

1179
01:03:30,967 --> 01:03:34,300
I want to marry you
more than anything
in the world but...

1180
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:36,933
But?

1181
01:03:37,067 --> 01:03:40,200
Well, there's something
I have to straighten
out first.

1182
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:43,533
Let's not talk about it.
Okay.

1183
01:03:44,567 --> 01:03:46,467
I'll propose again
tomorrow.

1184
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:01,667
LARRY: What's new?

1185
01:04:01,767 --> 01:04:05,733
Brought in a nine-pounder
this afternoon. Boy.

1186
01:04:05,833 --> 01:04:07,200
LARRY: Congratulations.

1187
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,233
It was a madhouse today.

1188
01:04:10,333 --> 01:04:11,467
DR. HOFFMAN: A rat race.

1189
01:04:11,567 --> 01:04:14,233
LARRY: Mrs. Cricket at the bar
swallowed a dime.

1190
01:04:14,333 --> 01:04:15,967
DR. HOFFMAN: (CHUCKLING)

1191
01:04:16,067 --> 01:04:18,067
No news from Leonora.

1192
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:19,933
DR. HOFFMAN: Well, maybe
she isn't feeling well.

1193
01:04:20,067 --> 01:04:21,567
She'll be back tomorrow.

1194
01:04:21,667 --> 01:04:24,167
Yeah, I dropped by her place
on the way from hospital.
She's moved.

1195
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:25,567
Gone.

1196
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:27,600
Where to?

1197
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:30,300
Long Island,
the landlady said.
(PIPE CLANKING)

1198
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:31,867
You know, there's pipes
are on the brink again.

1199
01:04:31,967 --> 01:04:33,400
We ought to send
for the plumber.

1200
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:35,133
What's the matter
with the landlord?

1201
01:04:35,233 --> 01:04:37,167
Ah, they'll never
catch him.

1202
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:40,300
I was out with her last night.

1203
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:42,300
Well, didn't she
say anything?

1204
01:04:43,167 --> 01:04:45,067
About leaving?
No.

1205
01:04:46,133 --> 01:04:48,267
You didn't criticize
her again?

1206
01:04:48,367 --> 01:04:49,967
No.
(CHUCKLING)

1207
01:04:50,067 --> 01:04:52,100
I proposed to her
as matter of fact.

1208
01:04:56,233 --> 01:04:58,333
I thought I'd run out
to Long Island.

1209
01:04:59,067 --> 01:05:00,533
Oh.

1210
01:05:00,633 --> 01:05:04,167
Well, Larry, was last night
the first time you went
out with her?

1211
01:05:05,667 --> 01:05:06,900
Yes.

1212
01:05:07,067 --> 01:05:08,900
Long Island?

1213
01:05:09,067 --> 01:05:11,700
Hmm...
I don't know.

1214
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:15,900
I ended up pretty
silly anyway.

1215
01:05:16,067 --> 01:05:20,067
All I can get out of her
was that she was
a paid companion

1216
01:05:20,133 --> 01:05:21,700
to somebody rich.

1217
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:24,833
(CHUCKLING)
Nice work if you
can get it.

1218
01:05:24,933 --> 01:05:27,667
(CHUCKLING)
I can just hear
the conversation.

1219
01:05:27,767 --> 01:05:31,267
"Good evening,
Mr. so and so.
I'm Dr. Quinada."

1220
01:05:31,367 --> 01:05:34,700
"Are you by any chance
keeping one of my
former employees,."

1221
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:37,200
"A Miss Leonora Eames?"

1222
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:39,200
(CHUCKLING)
Yeah. Yeah.

1223
01:05:39,733 --> 01:05:41,533
Well...

1224
01:05:41,633 --> 01:05:44,567
Why don't you
forget her?

1225
01:05:44,667 --> 01:05:45,867
LARRY: You think so?

1226
01:05:46,367 --> 01:05:47,500
Well, yeah.

1227
01:05:48,233 --> 01:05:49,567
LARRY: All right.

1228
01:05:50,933 --> 01:05:54,500
Good night.

Larry.

MAN: Well, it adds
up to be nothing more
Yes?

1230
01:05:56,067 --> 01:05:59,067
Than a windy
analysis which, uh...
I'll tell him.

1231
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:01,633
SMITH: Which shows absolutely
no conception of the problem

1232
01:06:01,733 --> 01:06:03,500
in plain terms
of dollars and cents.

1233
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:06,067
As to paragraph four,
this too is completely
ridiculous.

1234
01:06:06,167 --> 01:06:07,867
Yes.
If you want me
to invest one penny...

1235
01:06:07,967 --> 01:06:09,067
Who was that?

1236
01:06:09,167 --> 01:06:12,433
Dr. Quinada is calling
to see Miss Eames.
Who?

1237
01:06:12,967 --> 01:06:14,067
Miss Eames?

1238
01:06:14,167 --> 01:06:16,867
I'll get rid of him,
darling.
Get rid of yourself.

1239
01:06:16,967 --> 01:06:19,233
Send him in.
Of course, darling.

1240
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:24,200
If you want me
to invest one penny,

1241
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:26,500
you will do it my way
or not at all.

1242
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:29,367
Sincerely yours.

1243
01:06:29,467 --> 01:06:32,433
That's all, gentlemen.
Good night.
Good night.

1244
01:06:32,533 --> 01:06:34,967
Good night, Mr. Ohlrig.
Good night,

1248
01:07:04,433 --> 01:07:05,567
Good evening.

1249
01:07:13,067 --> 01:07:16,067
I'm Smith Ohlrig.
Would you like a drink?

1250
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:17,167
Thank you.

1251
01:07:21,067 --> 01:07:24,333
Is Miss Eames here?
She'll be right down.
Champagne?

1252
01:07:24,433 --> 01:07:26,233
I'd rather have
something else
if you don't mind.

1253
01:07:26,333 --> 01:07:28,067
Scotch?
That'll be fine.

1254
01:07:29,367 --> 01:07:32,600
I might have known
you'd be good-looking.

1255
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:34,667
Leonora was very
impressed with you.

1256
01:07:34,767 --> 01:07:36,967
I was very much
impressed with her.

1257
01:07:37,067 --> 01:07:40,133
She started from scratch
and learned to a good
job very quickly.

1258
01:07:41,533 --> 01:07:43,500
Soda?
Plain water, please.

1259
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:46,700
Also, she's very
attractive.
That always helps.

1260
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:48,100
Yes, it does.

1261
01:07:49,733 --> 01:07:53,267
I'm glad you and Leonora
are hitting it off
so well together.

1262
01:07:53,367 --> 01:07:55,667
There's nothing
like a little extra
curricular romance

1263
01:07:55,767 --> 01:07:57,833
after office hours,
is there, Doctor?

1264
01:07:57,933 --> 01:08:00,367
It's hardly any business
of yours, Mr. Ohlrig.

1265
01:08:00,467 --> 01:08:03,967
Just interested
in employer-employee
relationships.

1266
01:08:04,067 --> 01:08:07,100
After all, Leonora
was an employee of mine.

1267
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:08,800
In a way, she still is.

1268
01:08:09,367 --> 01:08:10,533
How do you mean?

1269
01:08:10,633 --> 01:08:11,900
We're still married.

1270
01:08:21,700 --> 01:08:24,967
I always had a curious
feeling that I'd seen
Leonora before.

1271
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:27,233
Now I know where.

1272
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:30,100
In the newspapers.

1273
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:33,067
A picture, right after
your wedding.

1274
01:08:37,233 --> 01:08:39,167
I better go.
I'm afraid I've
made a mistake.

1275
01:08:39,267 --> 01:08:40,700
I'm afraid you have.

1276
01:09:04,067 --> 01:09:05,367
Thank you.

me outside.

01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:15,767
In the garden

Larry!

1283
01:10:27,667 --> 01:10:29,267
Why didn't you say
anything to me?

1284
01:10:29,367 --> 01:10:30,533
How could you run
away like a child?

1285
01:10:30,633 --> 01:10:31,900
I tried to tell
you, Larry.
When?

1286
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,167
Well, the very
first day, but I wanted
the job and I...

1287
01:10:35,267 --> 01:10:37,900
How could you sit
at that bar with me
and you say nothing?

1288
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,433
(STUTTERING)
I just couldn't.

1289
01:10:39,533 --> 01:10:40,867
Did you know you were
gonna go back to him?

1290
01:10:40,967 --> 01:10:43,200
No, not then.
What you made
you do it?

1291
01:10:43,300 --> 01:10:45,467
I had to.
You said you loved me.

1292
01:10:45,567 --> 01:10:47,500
I do. I...
Then what is it?

1293
01:10:48,667 --> 01:10:50,300
Are you afraid of him?

1294
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:53,300
No, I...
Then what?
Tell me.

1295
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:54,933
I'm going to have a baby.

1296
01:11:03,267 --> 01:11:05,700
Le, listen.
Forget that I love you.

1297
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:07,267
Larry...
No, no, I mean it.

1298
01:11:07,367 --> 01:11:10,133
Forget that I want you,
that I want to marry you.
But believe this.

1299
01:11:10,233 --> 01:11:12,100
You can't stay here.
You got to leave him.

1300
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:14,667
I can't.
I'm not saying this just
because of how I feel.

1301
01:11:14,767 --> 01:11:16,800
I was with that man
for three minutes.

1302
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:18,933
But I know
he's not normal.
He's dangerous.

1303
01:11:19,067 --> 01:11:20,200
You've got to get
out of here.

1304
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:22,067
Larry, it's his baby.

1305
01:11:22,133 --> 01:11:25,067
So because of convention,
you'll let him destroy
you and your child?

1306
01:11:25,167 --> 01:11:26,333
No, I won't let him.

1307
01:11:26,433 --> 01:11:29,233
You will help.
Without meaning to,
you'll help!

1308
01:11:29,333 --> 01:11:31,667
You sat in my office
too many times
not to know

1309
01:11:31,767 --> 01:11:33,567
what happens to a child
whose parents
are messed up.

1310
01:11:33,667 --> 01:11:36,667
But I know what happens
to a child whose parents
haven't got anything.

1311
01:11:36,767 --> 01:11:38,067
That's why you came
back to him, isn't it?

1312
01:11:38,133 --> 01:11:41,267
No, I came back
for my baby, for his future.
I want security.

1313
01:11:41,367 --> 01:11:43,500
You want money.
Isn't that why
you married him?

1314
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:44,967
No, no.
For security?

1315
01:11:45,067 --> 01:11:47,067
I thought I loved him.
You mean you made
yourself think that.

1316
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:48,233
(SIGHING)
Don't.

1317
01:11:48,333 --> 01:11:49,767
You found out it
was wrong to marry
just for money,

1318
01:11:49,867 --> 01:11:52,333
so you had
to make yourself...
No.

1319
01:11:52,433 --> 01:11:56,400
You still got those
same ridiculous ideas.
Marry rich, live rich.

1320
01:11:56,500 --> 01:11:58,667
I didn't know
what to do.
You know what you want.

1321
01:11:58,767 --> 01:11:59,867
Yes, I want you, but I...

1322
01:11:59,967 --> 01:12:01,500
But you want your
child to be rich.

1323
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:03,367
Well, make up
your mind, Leonora.

1324
01:12:03,467 --> 01:12:04,967
I'd be the last man
to say that anyone

1325
01:12:05,067 --> 01:12:06,667
can be secure without
money in this world,

1326
01:12:06,767 --> 01:12:08,233
but money alone
isn't security,

1327
01:12:08,333 --> 01:12:10,067
as you ought to know
it by now.

1328
01:12:10,133 --> 01:12:12,467
What should I do?
Tell me.
Grow up!

1329
01:12:12,567 --> 01:12:15,433
If you're still gonna
be wishing for mink coats
and houses like this...

1330
01:12:15,533 --> 01:12:17,067
I don't want you.
(CLICKING)

1331
01:12:23,433 --> 01:12:26,067
Trying to recapture
the feeling of
the East Side, Leonora?

1332
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:27,233
Smith, we were...

1333
01:12:27,333 --> 01:12:29,967
I understood you
were such a moral
character, Doctor.

1334
01:12:30,067 --> 01:12:32,733
Not the type to make
passes at somebody
else's wife.

1335
01:12:32,833 --> 01:12:34,267
Of course, Leonora
doesn't surprise me.

1336
01:12:34,367 --> 01:12:35,467
That's about enough!

1337
01:12:35,567 --> 01:12:36,600
Now, look...

1338
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:39,233
And stop clenching
your fists.

1339
01:12:39,333 --> 01:12:41,333
I would be only
too glad to take
a crack at you

1340
01:12:41,433 --> 01:12:43,067
but it wouldn't
settle a thing.

1341
01:12:45,333 --> 01:12:48,067
The only one of us who can
settle this is Leonora.

1342
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:49,367
Smith, Larry was...
Don't try to act...

1343
01:12:49,467 --> 01:12:51,267
I'll tell you exactly
what's been going
on, Ohlrig.

1344
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:53,733
I told Leonora that
I love her and I want
to marry her.

1345
01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:57,800
Did you bother
to tell him
about the child?

1346
01:12:57,900 --> 01:12:59,700
LARRY: Yes, and I warned
her that you'll ruin it.

1347
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:01,400
You take a lot
for granted.
LARRY: Nothing.

1348
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:03,333
I don't even want
Leonora until she decides

1349
01:13:03,433 --> 01:13:05,900
how important money
really is to her.

1350
01:13:06,067 --> 01:13:07,100
SMITH: Oh, I can answer
that without even...

1351
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:09,333
It's not your answer
I'm interested in!
It's hers.

1352
01:13:16,367 --> 01:13:18,633
If you make up
your mind,
you can always call.

1353
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:54,267
Whose child
are you having?

1354
01:13:56,900 --> 01:13:58,900
From the moment
I came back,
I've had to listen

1355
01:13:59,067 --> 01:14:02,500
to your filthy
insinuations.
Well not anymore.

1356
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:06,067
Come down here, Leonora.
I said come down here.

1357
01:14:06,100 --> 01:14:08,433
You came back to get
a divorce, didn't you?

1358
01:14:08,533 --> 01:14:13,367
You wanted to divorce me
and live happily ever after
with him on my money.

1359
01:14:13,467 --> 01:14:15,267
I don't want your money.

1360
01:14:15,367 --> 01:14:17,067
But you do wanna
leave me, don't you?

1361
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:19,200
Yes.

1362
01:14:21,233 --> 01:14:23,067
We're all wrong
together, Smith.

1363
01:14:25,833 --> 01:14:27,800
It's been a mistake
from the beginning.

1364
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:32,233
You can have a divorce
on one condition.

1365
01:14:33,167 --> 01:14:34,400
Come down here.

1366
01:14:40,933 --> 01:14:43,567
You know, Leonora,
you still walk like a model.

1367
01:14:43,667 --> 01:14:45,400
And not a very
good one at that.

1368
01:14:46,767 --> 01:14:48,900
Are you in love with
your doctor friend?
Smith.

1369
01:14:49,067 --> 01:14:50,800
You are, aren't you?
What does...

1370
01:14:50,900 --> 01:14:52,567
Admit it.

1371
01:14:52,667 --> 01:14:54,433
Do you care whether
I am or not?

1372
01:14:54,533 --> 01:14:56,300
Yes, I want you
to be in love with him.

1373
01:14:57,100 --> 01:14:58,500
Why?

1374
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:01,267
Because then it's easier
for me to win.

1375
01:15:01,367 --> 01:15:03,700
Win what?
What is it you
want, Smith?

1376
01:15:05,667 --> 01:15:09,200
You can have your divorce,
but I get the child.
That's the condition.

1377
01:15:10,733 --> 01:15:13,733
You know I wouldn't
do that!
Of course I do.

1378
01:15:13,833 --> 01:15:16,733
I also know I can get
custody of the child
anytime I want.

1379
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:20,667
How?

1380
01:15:20,767 --> 01:15:24,233
By suing you
for divorce and naming
Quinada correspondent.

1381
01:15:24,333 --> 01:15:27,400
But we haven't done
anything wrong.

1382
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:29,400
If you have money,
you could always
get enough people

1383
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:31,067
to swear to anything
you want.

1384
01:15:34,133 --> 01:15:35,567
You wouldn't!

1385
01:15:35,667 --> 01:15:38,567
Oh, yes, I would.
And what's more, I will.

1386
01:15:38,667 --> 01:15:41,733
If you ever so much
as talk to him
on the phone.

1387
01:15:41,833 --> 01:15:45,133
You once told me
you thought I was sorry
from the moment we married.

1388
01:15:45,233 --> 01:15:46,567
That's pretty mild.

1389
01:15:46,667 --> 01:15:49,267
I hated myself
for being such a fool.

1390
01:15:49,367 --> 01:15:51,333
I never wanted you
in the first place.

1391
01:15:51,433 --> 01:15:53,900
The more you fought me,
the more I began
to dislike you.

1392
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:56,733
I think now I hate you.

1393
01:15:56,833 --> 01:15:58,433
All I care about
is breaking you.

1394
01:15:58,533 --> 01:16:01,067
And if I have
to use the child
to do it, I will.

1395
01:16:01,133 --> 01:16:03,767
You know enough
about me to know
that I can't stand losing.

1396
01:16:03,867 --> 01:16:07,067
Only nice people lose
and you're obviously
a nice girl.

1397
01:16:07,167 --> 01:16:09,300
All you came back
for is that child.

1398
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:11,200
And as long as you
want it, you're stuck here.

1399
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:13,300
And that's probably
for the rest of your life!

1400
01:16:14,367 --> 01:16:17,067
Smith.
Smith, wait!

1401
01:16:17,133 --> 01:16:19,633
Wait, Smith.
Smith!

1402
01:16:19,733 --> 01:16:22,867
Oh, Smith, you don't mean it.
You're just angry with me.
(CRYING)

1403
01:16:22,967 --> 01:16:26,867
LEONORA: Smith, listen,
please let me have my baby.

1404
01:16:26,967 --> 01:16:29,433
Don't take my baby,
Smith, don't!

1405
01:16:29,533 --> 01:16:31,200
LEONORA: Oh, Smith!
(RINGING)

1406
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:33,300
(CRYING)
Oh, Smith.

1407
01:17:12,367 --> 01:17:14,133
FRANZI: "From the way
that multimillionaire"

1408
01:17:14,233 --> 01:17:16,833
"has been treating
his car hop wife
the last three months,"

1409
01:17:16,933 --> 01:17:20,667
"we understand she is ready
to call the Long Island
estate, Wit's End."

1410
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:22,433
"Ha! Ha!"

1411
01:17:22,533 --> 01:17:24,567
I can't even get her
on the phone.

1412
01:17:34,167 --> 01:17:36,100
Tell Leonora
I wanna see her.

1413
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:37,300
Smith, it's so late.

1414
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:40,067
Tell Leonora
I wanna see her!
Right now.

1415
01:17:58,833 --> 01:18:00,933
(CLICKING)

1416
01:18:05,133 --> 01:18:07,067
(CLICKING)

1417
01:18:29,833 --> 01:18:31,933
(MOANING)

1418
01:18:34,433 --> 01:18:35,733
(KNOCKING)

1419
01:18:36,333 --> 01:18:37,700
FRANZI: Leonora.

1420
01:18:38,567 --> 01:18:40,467
(KNOCKING)

1421
01:18:40,567 --> 01:18:42,600
FRANZI: Leonora, I know
you're awake.

1422
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:46,367
Leonora.
(KNOCKING)

1423
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:54,333
Leonora, he's in a rage.
He'll come up himself.
You know that.

1424
01:18:54,433 --> 01:18:56,067
(KNOCKING)

1425
01:18:57,333 --> 01:18:58,867
FRANZI: Leonora!

1426
01:19:04,067 --> 01:19:06,633
It's really plain, darling.
Why you didn't answer
the phone when he called?

1427
01:19:06,733 --> 01:19:09,067
He's in a terrible rage.
I didn't hear.

1428
01:19:09,133 --> 01:19:11,533
He let it ring for five
minutes by the clock
and he was in a conference.

1429
01:19:11,633 --> 01:19:13,067
I pulled it out.

1430
01:19:13,167 --> 01:19:16,667
I won't let him call me
night after night
and week after week,

1431
01:19:16,767 --> 01:19:18,067
every night, never.

1432
01:19:18,133 --> 01:19:20,067
Yes, yes, yes, I know,
darling, but...
(SIGHING)

1433
01:19:20,133 --> 01:19:22,167
But he wants you
to come downstairs.
No, no.

1434
01:19:22,267 --> 01:19:25,200
Just a few minutes.
No, I won't.

1435
01:19:25,300 --> 01:19:27,667
Leonora, please,
he's terribly furious.

1436
01:19:27,767 --> 01:19:28,967
I've never seen him
so upset in my life.

1437
01:19:29,067 --> 01:19:30,167
The doctor told
him we mustn't...

1438
01:19:30,267 --> 01:19:33,200
The doctor told him
I mustn't go out
of the house.

1439
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:34,967
I must get some sleep.

1440
01:19:35,067 --> 01:19:36,533
Darling, I...
He knows that.

1441
01:19:36,633 --> 01:19:39,333
The doctor told him
he mustn't call me
and wake me,

1442
01:19:39,433 --> 01:19:41,233
and take me out
of the house
at all hours.

1443
01:19:41,333 --> 01:19:42,767
Just this last time.

1444
01:19:42,867 --> 01:19:44,267
No, I can't.

1445
01:19:44,367 --> 01:19:47,167
Please.
No, no, I won't.
I won't.

1446
01:19:47,533 --> 01:19:48,933
I won't.

1447
01:20:16,033 --> 01:20:19,567
Larry.
Larry, I need you.
(CRYING)

1448
01:20:19,667 --> 01:20:23,067
Larry, they won't
let me sleep.

1449
01:20:23,167 --> 01:20:26,700
I wanna sleep, Larry.
I want help.
(SOBBING)

1450
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:28,633
Please, Larry, make
them leave me alone.

1451
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:34,400
Smith.
Is she coming down?

1452
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:36,267
She's very sick.
I feel sorry for her.

1453
01:20:36,367 --> 01:20:39,033
I think it's a mistake.
A woman in her condition,
to treat her like...

1454
01:20:39,133 --> 01:20:42,233
Is she coming down?

1455
01:20:42,333 --> 01:20:45,467
Why the devil do you think
I sent you up there,
you dirty little parasite?

1456
01:20:45,567 --> 01:20:47,733
Get her down here.

1457
01:20:47,833 --> 01:20:51,300
I think I'd prefer
to be a headwaiter
again, Mr. Ohlrig.

1458
01:20:57,833 --> 01:21:01,500
You know, you're
a big man but not big
enough to destroy that girl.

1459
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:03,867
Goodbye.

1460
01:21:10,433 --> 01:21:11,900
Dirty little snake.

1461
01:21:14,567 --> 01:21:15,833
Not big enough to...

1462
01:21:18,767 --> 01:21:20,567
If she doesn't come down...

1463
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:25,700
(BANGING)

1464
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:27,433
(CLATTERING)
SMITH: Leonora!

1465
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:32,100
(YELLING)

1466
01:21:45,733 --> 01:21:47,067
(GROANING)

1467
01:22:02,833 --> 01:22:05,567
SMITH: (WHEEZING)

1468
01:22:17,167 --> 01:22:18,433
(GROANING)
Leonora.

1469
01:22:19,933 --> 01:22:22,067
Get me some water.

1470
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:24,233
Get me some water.

1471
01:22:25,967 --> 01:22:27,067
Leonora.

1472
01:22:28,833 --> 01:22:29,833
Please...

1473
01:22:30,700 --> 01:22:33,600
Please...
Get me some...

1474
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:35,800
Water.

1475
01:22:39,467 --> 01:22:40,633
Leonora.

1476
01:22:43,933 --> 01:22:45,067
Leonora...

1477
01:22:47,733 --> 01:22:49,067
I need some...

1478
01:22:51,067 --> 01:22:53,267
Water.
Water.

1479
01:22:54,900 --> 01:22:59,067
DOCTOR: Blood pressure,
110 over 70.
EKG, normal.

1480
01:22:59,133 --> 01:23:02,200
He'll live.
Discontinue the oxygen.

1481
01:23:05,533 --> 01:23:07,500
(MURMURING)

1482
01:23:37,333 --> 01:23:38,400
Le?

1483
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:39,900
LEONORA: I killed him.

1484
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:43,400
Le.
I killed him.

1485
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:49,067
He was lying
on the floor and
I left him there.

1486
01:23:50,300 --> 01:23:51,767
I killed him.

1487
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:57,267
I called you.
I'm here, darling.
I'm here.

1488
01:23:58,067 --> 01:23:59,633
I killed him.

1489
01:24:00,467 --> 01:24:01,900
I did.

1490
01:24:03,633 --> 01:24:04,833
I killed him.

1491
01:24:08,667 --> 01:24:11,067
LEONORA: I wanted
him to die.

1492
01:24:11,567 --> 01:24:12,667
Larry.

1493
01:24:14,067 --> 01:24:15,533
Larry, I need you.

1494
01:24:16,567 --> 01:24:20,500
I want...
I want you back.

1495
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:22,700
Here, take
a drink of this.
I want you back and...

1496
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:24,733
Put your head back.
Put your head back.

1497
01:24:26,433 --> 01:24:28,067
There.

1498
01:24:28,167 --> 01:24:29,333
One of his pills...

1499
01:24:31,133 --> 01:24:33,967
And I called his doctor...
Now, hold on.
Take another drink.

1500
01:24:36,433 --> 01:24:39,333
There now.
You'll be all right.

1501
01:24:39,433 --> 01:24:41,100
And the doctor...

1502
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:45,067
Says he's going
to die.
He won't.

1503
01:24:46,067 --> 01:24:48,067
I wanted him to die.

1504
01:24:48,767 --> 01:24:51,700
Now, be quite.
Be quiet now.

1505
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:53,733
I'm with you.
You're gonna be safe.

1506
01:24:53,833 --> 01:24:55,467
Nothing's gonna
happen to you.

1507
01:24:55,567 --> 01:24:59,767
Oh, Larry, I wanted
you so...
Mmm-hmm.

1508
01:24:59,867 --> 01:25:03,533
When he said he'd take
my baby away...

1509
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:05,467
He said...

1510
01:25:06,367 --> 01:25:09,667
(GRUNTING)
Oh, Larry.

1511
01:25:11,067 --> 01:25:12,533
Larry, it hurts!

1512
01:25:15,733 --> 01:25:17,300
LEONORA: (GROANING)
Oh!

1513
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:25,400
Stay here.
Don't move.

1514
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:27,067
I'll be back in a minute.

1515
01:25:37,667 --> 01:25:38,900
Is there a telephone
down here, sir?

1516
01:25:39,067 --> 01:25:41,500
Yes, sir, the left
of the front door, sir.
Okay, I got it.

1517
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:47,133
Is it over right here?
Thank you.
MAN: Right in there, sir.

1518
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:52,500
Operator.

1519
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:55,767
(SIREN WAILING)

1520
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:03,833
He isn't gonna die.
You didn't kill him.

1521
01:26:03,933 --> 01:26:05,900
I had a long talk
with his doctor.

1522
01:26:06,067 --> 01:26:09,600
He'll live to be
an old man.
But you...

1523
01:26:10,833 --> 01:26:13,933
Hey, listen,
can you hear me?

1524
01:26:14,067 --> 01:26:17,933
You can only live
if you want to
and you must want to.

1525
01:26:18,067 --> 01:26:20,667
That's why it's so
important that you
hear what I'm saying.

1526
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:26,133
He wanted to take
your child away,
maybe he succeeded.

1527
01:26:26,233 --> 01:26:29,767
Your child will die
and it's a terrible
thing, I know, but...

1528
01:26:29,867 --> 01:26:31,767
You'll be free
to start living.

1529
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:35,067
Isn't that true?

1530
01:26:38,067 --> 01:26:41,167
He can't hold
you anymore.
He won't even want to.

1531
01:26:41,267 --> 01:26:43,467
All he wanted was
to dominate you and kick

1532
01:26:43,567 --> 01:26:45,633
you around like
everybody else.

1533
01:26:45,733 --> 01:26:49,367
Only care about
the child was to use it,

1534
01:26:49,467 --> 01:26:51,100
to keep you
under his thumb.

1535
01:26:51,967 --> 01:26:53,533
But now you'll be free.

1536
01:26:54,267 --> 01:26:55,800
Free to start living.

1537
01:26:55,900 --> 01:26:59,400
Free to be happy,
doing the things
that are worthwhile.

1538
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:02,633
You can be
happy, darling.

1539
01:27:03,733 --> 01:27:06,067
That's why I want
you to hear me.

1540
01:27:09,133 --> 01:27:10,600
I hear you, Larry.

1541
01:27:21,967 --> 01:27:24,767
Larry, Larry.
She's okay.

1542
01:27:24,867 --> 01:27:27,100
Pre-mature birth,
the baby died.

1543
01:27:29,700 --> 01:27:32,433
LARRY: He can't hold her now,
even if he wants to.

1544
01:27:33,267 --> 01:27:34,767
She's free.

1545
01:27:35,833 --> 01:27:37,700
She shouldn't see anybody.
Oh, sure.

1546
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:40,100
(CHUCKLING)
I'll give you
two minutes.

1547
01:27:55,900 --> 01:27:57,367
DR. HOFFMAN: Where are you
taking that?

1548
01:27:57,467 --> 01:27:59,067
In here.
No, no, she can't
be disturbed.

1549
01:27:59,100 --> 01:28:02,067
But Jacqueline doesn't
want to be responsible
for the darn coat, Doctor.

1550
01:28:02,133 --> 01:28:05,700
Don't worry about it.
If my diagnosis is correct,
she won't want that anyway.

1551
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:07,267
All right.
