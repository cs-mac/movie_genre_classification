Yes, this is Valentine, Maria pers -
(chuckles) Maria Enders' personal assistant.

(sighs) No, I still can't - I'm -

28
00:02:06,725 --> 00:02:10,145
We're in the Alps. There's a ton
of mountains and tunnels and I -

29
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:11,563
Yeah.

30
00:02:16,902 --> 00:02:20,781
Did you read this article about Google
and users' private information?

31
00:02:20,864 --> 00:02:23,075
It's disgraceful.

32
00:02:23,158 --> 00:02:25,202
They're too powerful. Thanks.

33
00:02:25,285 --> 00:02:28,705
So, I have no service in here because of
all the tunnels, but I did reach Gwen.

34
00:02:28,789 --> 00:02:31,208
She said that she's gonna take
the X-Men thing off of IMDb.

35
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:34,711
I did one. That was enough.
No way am I playing Nemesis again.

36
00:02:34,795 --> 00:02:38,757
Well, they have to do it now because
everyone's blogging about it already.

37
00:02:38,841 --> 00:02:42,553
Yeah. I'm sick of acting hanging
from wires in front of green screens.

38
00:02:42,636 --> 00:02:44,805
I've outgrown it.

39
00:02:44,888 --> 00:02:46,890
Fans are gonna be devastated.

40
00:02:46,974 --> 00:02:49,768
Oh, did you speak to, um -
What's his name?

41
00:02:49,852 --> 00:02:52,062
- Um... Urs. Urs Kobler?
- Yeah, I did.

42
00:02:52,145 --> 00:02:53,981
Is the agenda set for tonight?

43
00:02:54,064 --> 00:02:56,275
Yeah, you're all set.
You have just the three interviews.

44
00:02:56,358 --> 00:02:59,862
And then it's the presentation of the award
and the official dinner.

45
00:02:59,945 --> 00:03:03,532
He's gonna meet us at the train station
in Zurich to take us to the Dolder -

46
00:03:03,615 --> 00:03:07,202
Dolder. (chuckles)
Th-That's where you wanted to stay, right?

47
00:03:07,286 --> 00:03:10,539
- I've written a first draft. Want to hear it?
- Sure.

48
00:03:15,335 --> 00:03:17,546
“I'm very honored
that Wilhelm Melchior asked me

49
00:03:17,629 --> 00:03:20,716
to accept the prize
you're awarding him tonight.

50
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:25,220
As you all know, he decided a long time ago
to stay away from all public events.

51
00:03:25,304 --> 00:03:29,016
Not because he's shy or proud.
He's a modest and generous man.

52
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:32,895
But he insists on protecting
the peace and quiet he needs to write.

53
00:03:32,978 --> 00:03:37,900
I wish that I could promise you all
that I myself will place this prize in his hands.

54
00:03:37,983 --> 00:03:40,569
(chuckles)
But Wilhelm has forbidden me to do so.

55
00:03:40,652 --> 00:03:43,447
He asked me to join him tomorrow
in Sils Maria,

56
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,574
where he lives for part of the year,

57
00:03:45,657 --> 00:03:48,160
but on one condition -
that I come empty-handed.

58
00:03:50,495 --> 00:03:54,416
(sighs) If I'm here tonight,
it's because I owe everything to him.

59
00:03:54,499 --> 00:03:58,754
He chose an unknown 18-year-old actress
for the lead in the play you all know,

60
00:03:58,837 --> 00:04:00,255
<i>Maloja Snake,</i>

61
00:04:00,339 --> 00:04:01,924
and then for the film.

62
00:04:02,007 --> 00:04:04,509
That unknown actress
who played Sigrid was me.

63
00:04:05,177 --> 00:04:08,805
In two months of shooting
he gave me everything I needed to bui -

64
00:04:08,889 --> 00:04:11,433
build a career on - my career.”

65
00:04:11,516 --> 00:04:15,270
Up to here it's fine.
And then it's all downhill.

66
00:04:15,354 --> 00:04:17,356
Just fragments.

67
00:04:18,357 --> 00:04:22,194
- You want me to finish it for you?
- No, I'm the one who has to pay tribute to him.

68
00:04:22,277 --> 00:04:25,322
I have to find my own words.
If I'm stuck, <i>I'll</i> ask you. Okay?

69
00:04:29,326 --> 00:04:33,372
Mappy says it's gonna take two and a half
hours to get to Sils Maria from Zurich.

70
00:04:33,455 --> 00:04:34,957
We have a driver.

71
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,878
Um, also, I texted Wilhelm's wife.
She hasn't got back to me yet.

72
00:04:41,004 --> 00:04:42,422
- That's not like Rosa.

Good evening, counselor.

76
00:04:56,687 --> 00:04:59,398
(in French) As I told your client,
my future ex-husband,

77
00:04:59,481 --> 00:05:03,360
I can't make the arbitration hearing
for the simple reason

78
00:05:03,443 --> 00:05:04,695
that <i>I'll</i> be abroad.

79
00:05:04,778 --> 00:05:08,448
Furthermore, I know he wants
my half of the apartment.

80
00:05:08,532 --> 00:05:10,158
I made a fair offer.

81
00:05:30,762 --> 00:05:34,558
(in French) Check the price of real estate
in the 7th arrondissement.

82
00:05:38,311 --> 00:05:42,441
I'm accommodating, but not dumb.
I know I'm on the losing end.

83
00:05:43,442 --> 00:05:45,152
I really need to talk to you.

84
00:05:45,235 --> 00:05:47,738

00:05:47,821 --> 00:05:50,198
I am entitled to force a sale.

86
00:05:50,282 --> 00:05:52,784

Just a second ago.

87
00:05:52,868 --> 00:05:56,788
Um, I know, I know.
I haven't told her yet, but, um -

88
00:05:56,872 --> 00:05:59,958
As soon as I can, okay?
I got it. Yeah, yeah.

89
00:06:04,337 --> 00:06:08,175
(in French) If he wants to sell
and split the money, fine with me.

90
00:06:08,258 --> 00:06:11,928
We'll put it up for sale
and you'll see the market price.

91
00:06:32,407 --> 00:06:34,409
Yeah - Hmm?

92
00:06:34,493 --> 00:06:36,828
Yeah, there's really nothing
on the net yet.

93
00:06:36,912 --> 00:06:39,414

comments.

95
00:06:42,542 --> 00:06:44,753
What kind of comments?

96
00:06:44,836 --> 00:06:49,091
You don't want to know. They're stupid.
It just says, you know -

97
00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:53,428
“Zorglub228:
I thought he died a while ago.

98
00:06:53,512 --> 00:06:56,431
Besides, he hasn't written
anything of interest in 20 years.”

99
00:06:56,515 --> 00:06:59,267
“Wiseguy666:
The media pays too much attention to writers.

100
00:06:59,351 --> 00:07:02,562
People die all over the world
and no one ever mentions them.”

101
00:07:04,022 --> 00:07:07,150
Zohrarose didn't know
who this guy was

102
00:07:07,234 --> 00:07:10,278
but offers her condolences to the family.

103
00:07:13,156 --> 00:07:16,535
So I spoke to Urs Kobler
and we canceled the press, obviously.

104
00:07:16,618 --> 00:07:19,579
I'm gonna work it out

Yeah, and people are going to be sad.

If I wanted to be true to him,
I'd turn around and go home.

Doors were locked,
the lights were out, he wasn't home.

154
00:10:10,792 --> 00:10:12,794
When did they find him?

155
00:10:12,877 --> 00:10:16,673
Late afternoon,
like, the middle of nowhere.

156
00:10:16,756 --> 00:10:18,800
They think it was a heart attack.

157
00:10:27,434 --> 00:10:32,147
(man speaking German)

158
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:35,066
-(radio beeps)
-(radio: man responds in German)

159
00:10:37,569 --> 00:10:40,071
(men conversing in German)

160
00:10:56,296 --> 00:10:59,341
MAN: it's so exciting having you here.

161
00:10:59,424 --> 00:11:01,134
Nice.

162
00:11:01,217 --> 00:11:04,220
The cockroaches
must have taken a later train.

163
00:11:06,931 --> 00:11:08,475
(in German)
Join us at the hotel.

164
00:11:08,558 --> 00:11:10,143
WOMAN (in German):
See you there.

165
00:11:11,603 --> 00:11:12,937
We are...

166
00:11:13,021 --> 00:11:15,565
in a - in a loss for words.

167
00:11:15,648 --> 00:11:19,944
I have to say, my first reaction
was to head right back.

168
00:11:20,028 --> 00:11:22,197
I understand.

169
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,698
We were wondering as well,

170
00:11:23,782 --> 00:11:27,786
should we move forward
or cancel everything?

171
00:11:28,495 --> 00:11:30,705
You know, here in Switzerland,

172
00:11:30,789 --> 00:11:34,501
we are not big
on public displays of anything.

173
00:11:36,086 --> 00:11:38,213
Especially grief.

174
00:11:38,296 --> 00:11:40,632
This should have been a celebration.

175
00:11:40,715 --> 00:11:44,135
And now it will be
a posthumous homage.

176
00:11:44,219 --> 00:11:47,055
It's gonna generate
the kind of press that we do not want.

177
00:11:47,138 --> 00:11:48,765
URS:
We'll try to keep them on distance.

178
00:11:48,848 --> 00:11:51,267
Paparazzi are going to be all over her.
You realize that, right?

179
00:11:51,351 --> 00:11:53,895
I have to think it over.

180
00:11:53,978 --> 00:11:57,023
Everything's hitting me at once,
so I... I don't know.

181
00:11:57,107 --> 00:12:00,652
Of course.
That's why we invited Henryk Wald.

182
00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:04,239
Henryk Wald?

183
00:12:04,989 --> 00:12:06,574
Yes.

184
00:12:06,658 --> 00:12:08,952
-(Maria exhales)
- He's devastated as well.

185
00:12:09,035 --> 00:12:14,124
But he agreed to hop on a plane
to be with us tonight.

186
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:18,461
If you'd prefer not to accept the prize,
Henryk can do it.

187
00:12:19,129 --> 00:12:20,964
It's up to you.

188
00:12:21,047 --> 00:12:24,134
He's associated with Wilhelm's theater.

189
00:12:24,217 --> 00:12:26,928
Most of the plays were written for him.

190
00:12:28,179 --> 00:12:31,349
- You don't appreciate him?
- We did two films together.

191
00:12:31,433 --> 00:12:34,269
No, we didn't get along very well.

192
00:12:34,352 --> 00:12:36,187
But I'm glad he's here.

193
00:12:37,147 --> 00:12:40,900
He and Wilhelm were very close,
and Rosa likes him a lot.

194
00:12:40,984 --> 00:12:42,610
He's a...

195
00:12:42,694 --> 00:12:44,529
a great actor.

196
00:12:44,612 --> 00:12:46,281
Yeah.

197
00:12:46,364 --> 00:12:48,408
One last question.

198
00:12:48,491 --> 00:12:50,618
Oh, I forgot to tell you this thing.
Sorry.

199
00:12:50,702 --> 00:12:52,954
- Chanel.
- Chanel.

200
00:12:53,037 --> 00:12:57,208
The press attache from Chanel is waiting for you
at the hotel to try on your gown.

201
00:12:57,292 --> 00:12:59,002
-(sighs)
- You don't have to.

202
00:12:59,085 --> 00:13:01,463
No, you do not have to.

203
00:13:09,304 --> 00:13:11,306
Can we turn this off?

204
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,687
- And no fruit. Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

205
00:13:35,914 --> 00:13:37,916
Okay, all good. Thank you.

206
00:13:43,505 --> 00:13:45,882
So, what do you think?
Would she stay?

207
00:13:45,965 --> 00:13:47,550
<i>Yeah, she'll - she'll stay.</i>

208
00:13:47,634 --> 00:13:50,220
Because if not,
I have to change the tickets.

209
00:13:50,303 --> 00:13:52,597
I know. She'll stay. Trust me.

210
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,599
Thank you.

211
00:13:56,309 --> 00:13:59,354
MARIA: I can't deal with this.
It's impossible.

212
00:13:59,437 --> 00:14:01,189
<i>I'll</i> never find the right words.

213
00:14:01,272 --> 00:14:02,273
<i>N</i> (phone chimes)

214
00:14:04,442 --> 00:14:07,779
His body isn't even cold yet,
and everybody wants a piece of him,

215
00:14:07,862 --> 00:14:09,656
starting with Henryk Wald, of course.

216
00:14:09,739 --> 00:14:12,617
Of course he'd be happy
to accept the prize.

217
00:14:13,826 --> 00:14:15,870
If only I could just not see him.

218
00:14:16,913 --> 00:14:18,498
Henryk?

219
00:14:18,581 --> 00:14:20,500
Why are you still so upset with him?

220
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:23,545
I have no reason
to have stopped being upset with him.

221
00:14:23,628 --> 00:14:26,047
- So he was in love with you or something.
- Not at all.

222
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:29,259
He was just furious
I didn't give in to him.

223
00:14:30,927 --> 00:14:32,971
He's perverse, violent.

224
00:14:33,054 --> 00:14:34,806
He hits women.

225
00:14:34,889 --> 00:14:37,350
He likes to humiliate them.
(chuckles)

226
00:14:37,433 --> 00:14:39,852
Look it up on the Internet.

227
00:14:39,936 --> 00:14:41,938
I thought we despised the Internet.

228
00:14:43,856 --> 00:14:44,857
- Caroline?
- Yes.

229
00:14:44,941 --> 00:14:46,526
Hey. Valentine.

230
00:14:46,609 --> 00:14:47,902
- Hello. Hi.
- Hi.

231
00:14:47,986 --> 00:14:51,573
Thanks for agreeing to this.
I know it must be really difficult for you.

232
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,997
-(shutter clicking)
-(Caroline clears throat)

233
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,000
-(speaks German)
- Uh, this is Berndt.

234
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:03,626
- Oh. Hi.
- Hi.

235
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,712
- Berndt. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

236
00:15:05,795 --> 00:15:08,756
You know those really trashy photos
I showed you of Lindsay Lohan?

237
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,842
This guy's responsible.

238
00:15:10,925 --> 00:15:13,344
But I'll try to be more elegant today.

239
00:15:28,693 --> 00:15:30,987
(man speaking German)

240
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,572
Mmm.

241
00:15:34,657 --> 00:15:36,659
(German)

242
00:16:26,334 --> 00:16:28,002
it's Rosa.

243
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:32,507
Am I bothering you?

244
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:35,093
I just wanted t-to tell you -

245
00:16:36,469 --> 00:16:38,179
to thank you.

246
00:16:38,262 --> 00:16:39,889
It's good that you're there.

247
00:16:39,972 --> 00:16:41,474
It's good...

248
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:44,852
that you're accepting the prize.

249
00:16:44,936 --> 00:16:47,063
It's what Wilhelm wanted.

250
00:16:49,816 --> 00:16:51,859
(laughing)
Henryk? No.

251
00:16:51,943 --> 00:16:55,613
You know what he thought of Henryk.

252
00:16:56,864 --> 00:17:01,369
The less he understands, the better he is,
and when he understands nothing he's excellent.

253
00:17:04,539 --> 00:17:08,000
(sighs) I would like to have
given you a hug, but...

254
00:17:08,793 --> 00:17:10,420
but I'm leaving.

255
00:17:11,212 --> 00:17:14,048
I can't stand being alone at Sils.

256
00:17:14,132 --> 00:17:15,842
It's too difficult.

257
00:17:16,509 --> 00:17:19,887
But there's something I want you,

258
00:17:19,971 --> 00:17:22,682
and only you...

259
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,649
(sobs)
to know.

260
00:17:31,733 --> 00:17:35,403
(chattering, laughing, faint)

261
00:17:35,486 --> 00:17:37,572
Mmm.

262
00:17:37,655 --> 00:17:40,408
(laughing, chattering continue)

263
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:45,371
So he knew about the illness
for a long time?

264
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:52,628
Did the autopsy say
what he swallowed?

265
00:17:55,465 --> 00:17:57,467
Oh, I see.

266
00:17:58,259 --> 00:18:00,261
He left nothing to chance.

267
00:18:01,345 --> 00:18:03,055
- Beautiful.
-(shutter clicking)

268
00:18:03,139 --> 00:18:04,849
Turn your body a bit sideways, please.

269
00:18:04,932 --> 00:18:07,643
Yeah. And chin up
a little bit, please. Thank you.

270
00:18:07,727 --> 00:18:09,604
Great. Yeah.

271
00:18:09,687 --> 00:18:11,272
- Maria?
- Hmm?

272
00:18:11,355 --> 00:18:15,610
- Sorry. it's, uh, your future ex.
- And again. All right?

273
00:18:15,693 --> 00:18:17,445
- Hold on a second.
- Right, right.

274
00:18:17,528 --> 00:18:19,405
Hello? Allô"?

275
00:18:21,199 --> 00:18:24,994
(in French) Spare me the gloom.
I'm not the one who died.

276
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:29,874
I know Wilhelm died.
I happen to be in Zurich.

277
00:18:43,054 --> 00:18:44,806
PHOTOGRAPHERS (shouting):
Maria! Maria!

278
00:18:44,889 --> 00:18:46,974
-(man shouts in French)
- Maria!

279
00:18:49,227 --> 00:18:51,562
- Maria!
- Maria!

280
00:18:51,646 --> 00:18:53,147
The press is all here.

281
00:18:53,231 --> 00:18:56,234
I don't know how
we'll squeeze them all in.

282
00:18:57,443 --> 00:19:01,322
MAN: One thing you should know -
we met very early, at the university.

283
00:19:01,405 --> 00:19:03,741
We were both studying
literature and theology.

284
00:19:06,577 --> 00:19:10,540
And I had the privilege of acting
in all of his plays, here and abroad.

285
00:19:10,623 --> 00:19:13,960
He had become a recluse -
mysterious, inaccessible.

286
00:19:14,043 --> 00:19:16,629
Wilhelm was the simplest man
in the world.

287
00:19:17,463 --> 00:19:21,300
He liked to ski in the winter
and go hiking in the summer.

288
00:19:21,384 --> 00:19:23,845
Those are the fondest memories
I have of him.

289
00:19:23,928 --> 00:19:27,473
His later work depicts
a bleak, destructive vision.

290
00:19:27,557 --> 00:19:29,600
I acted in those plays.

291
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,436
Mmm, it's true.

292
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,523
At times I found them scary.

293
00:19:38,985 --> 00:19:41,737
A sea of gray hair.

294
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,491
Completely.

295
00:19:46,617 --> 00:19:49,620
So, first I'll say a few words.

296
00:19:49,704 --> 00:19:52,206
(chuckling)
I hope I am up to the task.

297
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:53,916
And then I'll introduce Henryk.

298
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,712
Once he has finished,
he asks you to join him on stage.

299
00:19:57,795 --> 00:20:00,256
You'll introduce the film.
That's it.

300
00:20:15,396 --> 00:20:17,648
I saw Wilhelm two weeks ago.

301
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:21,152
We went hunting.

302
00:20:22,862 --> 00:20:26,449
He was his usual self.
There and not there.

303
00:20:29,785 --> 00:20:32,788
He mentioned the prize,
said he wouldn't be attending.

304
00:20:34,332 --> 00:20:36,584
I told him he'd miss
an opportunity to see you.

305
00:20:36,667 --> 00:20:41,130
I was on Long Island six months ago.
I spent a week with him and Rosa.

306
00:20:41,213 --> 00:20:43,382
- I know.
- I don't give a fuck that you know.

307
00:20:43,466 --> 00:20:45,009
(door opens)

308
00:20:45,092 --> 00:20:47,595
Henryk, you are almost on.

309
00:20:47,678 --> 00:20:49,847
-(speaks German)
- Excuse me.

310
00:20:50,598 --> 00:20:52,808
(Urs speaking German)

311
00:20:55,102 --> 00:20:58,272
We had an affair when we
were shooting Maloja <i>Snake.</i>

312
00:20:58,356 --> 00:21:01,609
- Yeah, I couldn't tell.
- I was 18, kind of dumb.

313
00:21:01,692 --> 00:21:03,694
And he really took advantage.

314
00:21:04,695 --> 00:21:07,156
After the shoot,
I never heard from him.

315
00:21:07,239 --> 00:21:10,159
- It destroyed me.
- I'm sure you've run into him since.

316
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:13,704
We made another film together
afterwards.

317
00:21:14,914 --> 00:21:17,291
- Which one?
- Oh, you don't want to know.

318
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:20,086
Tolstoy adaptation.
German producers.

319
00:21:20,169 --> 00:21:22,838
(laughs) Who cares, huh?

320
00:21:22,922 --> 00:21:25,007
Well, 10 years later, I was famous.

321
00:21:25,091 --> 00:21:27,468
<i>Then</i> he was interested.

322
00:21:27,551 --> 00:21:30,596
And he kept harassing me,
calling me in the middle of the night.

323
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,516
But I didn't give in, and that he hated.

324
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:37,895
And he made me pay for it
every single day of the shooting.

325
00:21:37,979 --> 00:21:42,566
He was really amazing in that one movie -
Um, what is it called?

326
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:47,446
He plays a Soviet defector
with, like, missile codes and shit.

327
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:49,824
- Um, do you know?
- No, I don't know.

328
00:21:49,907 --> 00:21:52,201
Never heard of it.

329
00:21:52,284 --> 00:21:54,578
He's great in it.

330
00:21:54,662 --> 00:21:57,289
So intense, especially
in the more physical scenes.

331
00:21:57,373 --> 00:22:00,167
That stare. He is like...

332
00:22:00,251 --> 00:22:02,837
- I like him.
- Yeah, I kind of got it.

333
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:06,048
I mean, as an actor
I really like him. I -

334
00:22:09,343 --> 00:22:12,096
(Speaking German)

335
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:17,852
<i>(in German) Unfortunately,
he must leave tomorrow morning.</i>

336
00:22:17,935 --> 00:22:20,021
<i>Henryk Wald!</i>

337
00:22:24,275 --> 00:22:29,905
<i>(m Germany.
I stood on this stage four years ago</i>

338
00:22:29,989 --> 00:22:32,658
<i>in</i> the <i>play</i> The Reichstag is Burning

339
00:22:32,742 --> 00:22:34,285
<i>by Wilhelm Melchior.</i>

340
00:22:35,953 --> 00:22:40,124
<i>Little did I know
it would be Wilhelm's last play.</i>

341
00:22:40,207 --> 00:22:42,793
<i>He was sitting there in the third row,</i>

342
00:22:42,877 --> 00:22:44,795
<i>staring at me.</i>

343
00:22:46,047 --> 00:22:48,215
<i>My acting was never so lousy.</i>

344
00:22:49,091 --> 00:22:51,135
Maria, you're on in five minutes.

345
00:22:51,218 --> 00:22:53,596
(audience applauding)

346
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,932
HENRYK (in German):
Wilhelm Melchior will be with us always...

347
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,185
in his plays.

348
00:22:59,268 --> 00:23:00,394
(whispering)
Maria.

349
00:23:00,478 --> 00:23:05,357
I will have the privilege of performing them
here, in London, everywhere.

350
00:23:05,441 --> 00:23:08,944
So I say not “Farewell,” but...

351
00:23:09,028 --> 00:23:10,321
“See you, Wilhelm.”

352
00:23:10,404 --> 00:23:12,573
(audience applauding)

353
00:23:13,824 --> 00:23:17,870
URS (in German): Thank you, Henryk,
for that wonderful tribute.

354
00:23:17,953 --> 00:23:23,375
Now please welcome
an old friend of Wilhelm's.

355
00:23:23,459 --> 00:23:25,878
A warm round of applause for...

356
00:23:25,961 --> 00:23:27,630
Maria Enders!

357
00:23:27,713 --> 00:23:30,716
(audience applauding, cheering)

358
00:23:32,843 --> 00:23:34,428
(whistles)

359
00:23:40,184 --> 00:23:42,186
Thank you.

360
00:23:44,188 --> 00:23:46,357
Go get 'em, tiger.

361
00:23:47,608 --> 00:23:49,443
MARIA:
Thank you very much.

362
00:24:08,671 --> 00:24:10,965
- Hi.
- Good evening. Welcome.

363
00:24:13,092 --> 00:24:15,136
I'm honored to welcome you here.

364
00:24:15,219 --> 00:24:18,305
I wish it had been
under happier circumstances.

365
00:24:18,389 --> 00:24:20,266
It's, um -

366
00:24:20,349 --> 00:24:23,811
it's great to celebrate his work.
Especially today.

367
00:24:23,894 --> 00:24:27,314
I was eager that the city of Zurich
pay tribute to him.

368
00:24:27,398 --> 00:24:29,692
He was very grateful to you.
He told me so.

369
00:24:32,736 --> 00:24:35,156
Hey. She'll just be two seconds.

370
00:24:35,239 --> 00:24:37,825
I'm sure she's gonna be thrilled
to be relieved from officialdom.

371
00:24:38,576 --> 00:24:41,704
- You know that his last play was set in Zurich.
- Oh, yes.

372
00:24:42,371 --> 00:24:44,999
He paints a rather dire portrait
of our political class.

373
00:24:45,082 --> 00:24:46,542
That's an understatement.

374
00:24:46,625 --> 00:24:49,920
- You should know. Your character was evil.
-(chuckles)

375
00:24:50,004 --> 00:24:52,339
Klaus Diesterweg is here to see you.

376
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,926
Excuse me. Sorry.

377
00:24:58,762 --> 00:25:01,056
I already told him no.

378
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:04,518
- He's here just to see you.
- The project doesn't interest me. Okay?

379
00:25:04,602 --> 00:25:07,938
He's a great director. Just hear him out.
You don't have to do it.

380
00:25:08,022 --> 00:25:11,567
- He's probably the best of his generation.
- I know. We saw the same productions.

381
00:25:12,401 --> 00:25:16,405
If you'd like to go on chatting with the mayor
and Henryk, you can be my guest.

382
00:25:18,407 --> 00:25:20,117
- No, thank you.
-(chuckles)

383
00:25:22,161 --> 00:25:23,787
Okay.

384
00:25:23,871 --> 00:25:27,625
Do you mind if I cut out for a bit?
I'm just gonna meet Berndt.

385
00:25:27,708 --> 00:25:29,001
Berndt?

386
00:25:29,084 --> 00:25:31,378
- The photographer.
-(whistles)

387
00:25:31,462 --> 00:25:34,673
We're just going to find somewhere
a bit livelier. This place is a dead zone.

388
00:25:34,757 --> 00:25:37,635
Oh. No problem.
I don't plan to hang around.

389
00:25:38,219 --> 00:25:39,553
Enjoy.

390
00:25:43,557 --> 00:25:46,227
- Thank you for finding time for me.
-It's a pleasure to meet you.

391
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:48,604
- I hope you don't find me too insistent.
- Not at all.

392
00:25:48,687 --> 00:25:52,149
I've seen quite a few of your productions.
I enjoy them, and...

393
00:25:52,983 --> 00:25:57,571
I know <i>we'll</i> find an opportunity
to work together in the future.

394
00:25:57,655 --> 00:25:59,323
Give me one more chance.

395
00:25:59,406 --> 00:26:00,991
Klaus.

396
00:26:04,245 --> 00:26:09,208
I played Sigrid in Maloja <i>Snake</i>
when I was 18.

397
00:26:09,291 --> 00:26:11,460
For me it was more than a role.

398
00:26:12,544 --> 00:26:14,922
In some way, I am still Sigrid.

399
00:26:15,005 --> 00:26:17,591
That's my point.
If Sigrid seduces Helena -

400
00:26:17,675 --> 00:26:21,428
And it has nothing to do with being a lesbian,
by the way. I've always been straight.

401
00:26:21,512 --> 00:26:23,597
That's not at all what I meant.

402
00:26:23,681 --> 00:26:25,766
Sigrid is free, beyond everything.

403
00:26:25,849 --> 00:26:28,269
And most of all,
she's disruptive, unpredictable.

404
00:26:28,352 --> 00:26:29,895
I know.

405
00:26:31,188 --> 00:26:34,692
And right or wrong, I've always
identified with that freedom.

406
00:26:35,693 --> 00:26:37,361
It's a way of, uh...

407
00:26:38,821 --> 00:26:40,489
protecting myself.

408
00:26:41,115 --> 00:26:42,449
Do you smoke?

409
00:26:42,533 --> 00:26:45,703
Uh, no, no. I - I try not to.

410
00:26:48,789 --> 00:26:51,166
And for you,
Helena embodies the opposite?

411
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:53,836
Helena is 40.
She's runs a company.

412
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,214
She falls head over heels in love
with a girl who doesn't love her

413
00:26:57,881 --> 00:26:59,425
and leads her to suicide.

414
00:26:59,508 --> 00:27:01,885
Yes. She's completely the opposite.

415
00:27:02,469 --> 00:27:06,974
But what is it that attracts Helena
to Sigrid, if they are so different?

416
00:27:07,057 --> 00:27:09,977
It's obvious. Her youth.

417
00:27:10,936 --> 00:27:15,316
Well, if you're telling me that I'm Helena's
age now, yeah, you're right, it's true.

418
00:27:15,399 --> 00:27:17,735
But that doesn't mean I can play her.

419
00:27:17,818 --> 00:27:19,987
The way I see Helena is totally different.

420
00:27:20,571 --> 00:27:24,283
Despite her bourgeois life,
despite her responsibilities,

421
00:27:24,366 --> 00:27:26,702
she's not the epitome of order

422
00:27:26,785 --> 00:27:29,330
and not at all the opposite of Sigrid.

423
00:27:29,413 --> 00:27:33,792
Well, she is married, with children,
her social life is a huge success,

424
00:27:33,876 --> 00:27:35,336
and she sacrifices it all.

425
00:27:35,419 --> 00:27:36,879
Yeah, she's destructive.

426
00:27:36,962 --> 00:27:40,758
Sigrid revives
this hidden violence in Helena.

427
00:27:40,841 --> 00:27:42,926
Was it hidden or tamed?

428
00:27:45,429 --> 00:27:48,307
Time's gone by
and she can't accept it.

429
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:49,933
Me neither, I guess.

430
00:27:52,561 --> 00:27:54,396
There's no antagonism.

431
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,816
It's the attraction of two women
with the same wound.

432
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,235
Sigrid and Helena
are one and the same person.

433
00:28:00,944 --> 00:28:03,197
One and the same person.

434
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,282
That's what the play is about.

435
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:10,412
And because you were Sigrid,
only you can be Helena now.

436
00:28:10,496 --> 00:28:13,374
Hmm. How can you be so sure?

437
00:28:13,457 --> 00:28:16,460
You know as well as I do
that Wilhelm Melchior

438
00:28:16,543 --> 00:28:18,545
had been working
on a sequel for years.

439
00:28:18,629 --> 00:28:22,383
Yes, but it was about Sigrid
at 40 years old.

440
00:28:22,466 --> 00:28:26,136
No, it was about Sigrid
20 years later became Helena.

441
00:28:29,848 --> 00:28:32,976
(sighs)
So who's to play Sigrid?

442
00:28:34,144 --> 00:28:35,938
Jo-Ann Ellis.

443
00:28:37,064 --> 00:28:40,401
She did a superhero movie
that just opened in the States.

444
00:28:41,151 --> 00:28:43,237
- And besides that?
- Not much.

445
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:48,075
She's 19. She's a lot more interesting
than her interviews and profiles.

446
00:28:48,158 --> 00:28:50,077
She has a theatrical background.

447
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,163
She doesn't want to be
swallowed up by Hollywood.

448
00:28:54,331 --> 00:28:58,001
She admires you, and she's willing
to pull out of her other commitments.

449
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:06,176
Well, I've listened carefully.

450
00:29:08,053 --> 00:29:10,889
But to be honest,
um, the role scares me.

451
00:29:10,973 --> 00:29:12,766
Helena scares me.

452
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:15,227
I'm in the middle of a divorce.

453
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:18,272
I feel alone and vulnerable.

454
00:29:18,355 --> 00:29:20,357
Probably too vulnerable to do this.

455
00:29:22,067 --> 00:29:24,820
If you refuse, <i>I'll</i> understand, but...

456
00:29:25,863 --> 00:29:27,865
it will be a missed opportunity.

457
00:29:28,824 --> 00:29:31,076
Especially for Wilhelm.
-(chuckles)

458
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:34,705
I should get going.

459
00:29:42,379 --> 00:29:45,382
Excuse me,
but I won't be staying for dinner.

460
00:29:47,217 --> 00:29:49,261
Good evening, Maria.

461
00:29:49,344 --> 00:29:51,472
Klaus.

462
00:29:51,555 --> 00:29:53,474
I have another reason.

463
00:29:53,557 --> 00:29:55,184
Susan Rosenberg.

464
00:29:55,893 --> 00:29:57,811
She played Helena with me.

465
00:29:57,895 --> 00:29:59,980
I remember Susan Rosenberg.

466
00:30:00,731 --> 00:30:03,275
She died in a car accident a year after.

467
00:30:04,985 --> 00:30:10,073
It's a superstition. I've always associated
her death with Helena's suicide.

468
00:30:10,157 --> 00:30:13,660
She was a lousy actress who didn't
understand a thing about the role.

469
00:30:15,579 --> 00:30:17,498
But her conventional style of acting

470
00:30:17,581 --> 00:30:20,083
highlighted the modernity
of your performance.

471
00:30:21,084 --> 00:30:22,878
You should be grateful to her.

472
00:30:32,804 --> 00:30:34,598
Please sit down.

473
00:30:35,933 --> 00:30:37,601
Thank you.

474
00:30:40,729 --> 00:30:42,856
Oh, is there a way of changing this?

475
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:46,276
- Can you put him in another place?
- I'm - I'm sorry. Oh, he's coming.

476
00:30:55,994 --> 00:30:58,997
(chattering)

477
00:31:02,626 --> 00:31:04,920
You were with Klaus Diesterweg.

478
00:31:05,003 --> 00:31:07,047
Are you going to accept his offer?

479
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:09,383
- What offer?
- You know.

480
00:31:09,466 --> 00:31:10,968
He's a very good director.

481
00:31:11,051 --> 00:31:14,137
If he'd offered me a role,
I'd accept it on the spot.

482
00:31:14,221 --> 00:31:16,890
So that means, um, I should accept it?

483
00:31:16,974 --> 00:31:19,351
- God, no!
-(laughing)

484
00:31:21,144 --> 00:31:23,981
This much-talked-about sequel of his -

485
00:31:25,607 --> 00:31:27,442
Remember, he never finished it.

486
00:31:27,526 --> 00:31:29,570
Sorry to be brutal,

487
00:31:29,653 --> 00:31:33,365
but I'm a simple man
and the play tells a simple story.

488
00:31:33,448 --> 00:31:36,034
An older woman falls in love
with a scheming girl

489
00:31:36,118 --> 00:31:38,495
that has her
wrapped around her little finger.

490
00:31:38,579 --> 00:31:40,455
The girl takes advantage of her,

491
00:31:40,539 --> 00:31:44,334
squeezes everything she can
out of her, then dumps her.

492
00:31:44,418 --> 00:31:47,212
Helena's love for Sigrid
makes her stupid

493
00:31:47,296 --> 00:31:50,674
and blind to what everybody
in the audience can see right away.

494
00:31:51,174 --> 00:31:54,177
But then, that's really
all she's ever wanted.

495
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:58,265
She's fascinated by her own downfall.

496
00:31:58,348 --> 00:32:00,434
It's as clear as day.

497
00:32:00,517 --> 00:32:04,896
That's why the play was such a hit
and is still being performed today.

498
00:32:07,316 --> 00:32:10,319
Why stage it
if you want to tell another story?

499
00:32:10,402 --> 00:32:13,196
I think your reading is simplistic.

500
00:32:14,031 --> 00:32:16,450
I know Sigrid,

501
00:32:16,533 --> 00:32:18,869
and believe me,
she's more interesting than that.

502
00:32:18,952 --> 00:32:24,791
Yes, she takes advantage of Helena.
Yes, she fascinates her and she knows it.

503
00:32:25,792 --> 00:32:30,130
You can decide not to look any further,
but I had to because I played her.

504
00:32:30,213 --> 00:32:32,758
You're just talking about
what's on the surface.

505
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:36,970
The play is about
what attracts them to each other.

506
00:32:37,054 --> 00:32:41,224
It's harder to see,
and it's more profound and truer.

507
00:32:42,476 --> 00:32:46,813
The impossibility of their relationship
is as cruel for Sigrid.

508
00:32:46,897 --> 00:32:48,899
(scoffs)
“Cruel for Sigrid.”

509
00:32:49,733 --> 00:32:52,319
- I'm sure she'll get over it.
- What do you know?

510
00:32:52,402 --> 00:32:54,488
Time. Youth.

511
00:32:54,571 --> 00:32:56,490
She has her life ahead of her.

512
00:32:56,573 --> 00:33:00,327
Well, Helena is young too. She's not old.
She has her life ahead of her too.

513
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:02,329
But she decides to give it all up.

514
00:33:02,412 --> 00:33:04,748
Helena is not used to
being turned down.

515
00:33:04,831 --> 00:33:07,668
She discovers her own frailty
and she can't accept it.

516
00:33:21,973 --> 00:33:25,185
We'll drop Mr. Wald off first, please.

517
00:33:26,645 --> 00:33:28,772
Grand Hotel du Lac, please.

518
00:33:32,776 --> 00:33:35,570
So Klaus has persuaded you.

519
00:33:35,654 --> 00:33:37,114
You're going to play Helena.

520
00:33:37,197 --> 00:33:38,907
(laughs)

521
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:41,034
I didn't say that.

522
00:33:41,118 --> 00:33:43,537
But I'm considering it.

523
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,455
Yes.

524
00:33:58,218 --> 00:34:01,638
Are you sure you don't want
to have a last drink?

525
00:34:01,722 --> 00:34:03,724
(laughing)

526
00:34:05,726 --> 00:34:08,145
I'm already drunk, darling.

527
00:34:13,483 --> 00:34:14,901
Henryk!

528
00:34:14,985 --> 00:34:17,237
- Yes?
- Hold on.

529
00:34:24,536 --> 00:34:26,830

Wow.

- Hey.
- Hi.

539
00:36:27,784 --> 00:36:31,037
I just found the main road again.
I'm sorry. I must have set the GPS wrong.

540
00:36:31,121 --> 00:36:33,874
Like an hour or so, probably.

541
00:36:34,624 --> 00:36:37,752
I had a... dream, um -

542
00:36:39,754 --> 00:36:41,882
We were already rehearsing and...

543
00:36:41,965 --> 00:36:44,968
past and the present
were blending together.

544
00:36:46,303 --> 00:36:48,722
- I'm confused.
- No kidding.

545
00:36:50,056 --> 00:36:53,018
I shouldn't have said yes to Klaus.

546
00:36:53,101 --> 00:36:57,397
But Wilhelm's death, mourning -
I couldn't refuse.

547
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,482
He is a sick director.

548
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:02,611
Jo-Ann's a superstar.
It pays well.

549
00:37:03,486 --> 00:37:05,238
I don't need the money.

550
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:08,658
Okay.

551
00:37:33,016 --> 00:37:34,559
Hi.

552
00:37:40,357 --> 00:37:42,359
ROSA:
Stay as long as you want.

553
00:37:42,442 --> 00:37:43,944
I like the fact

554
00:37:44,027 --> 00:37:47,822
that you are working on the part here,
where it was written.

555
00:37:48,865 --> 00:37:51,826
You promised - no ghosts.

556
00:37:52,661 --> 00:37:54,955
There - There aren't any.

557
00:37:55,038 --> 00:37:56,706
(laughs)
I was joking.

558
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:59,626
No. It was half-joking.

559
00:37:59,709 --> 00:38:02,379
(both laughing)

560
00:38:48,174 --> 00:38:50,885
ROSA:
This is what I wanted to show you.

561
00:38:50,969 --> 00:38:53,596
This is where Wilhelm killed himself.

562
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,808
But that - that stays
between you and me.

563
00:39:01,438 --> 00:39:04,524
Is that the Maloja Pass over there?

564
00:39:04,607 --> 00:39:05,900
Yeah.

565
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:08,111
- The snake, right?
- The snake.

566
00:39:08,194 --> 00:39:12,824
Why a snake?
In the play, it's, uh - it's ambiguous.

567
00:39:13,992 --> 00:39:15,660
The Maloja snake.

568
00:39:16,453 --> 00:39:19,122
It's a cloud formation.

569
00:39:19,205 --> 00:39:21,249
Fairly rare.

570
00:39:21,332 --> 00:39:23,209
Partially unexplained.

571
00:39:23,293 --> 00:39:26,296
It's a sign of bad weather.

572
00:39:27,213 --> 00:39:30,550
And the clouds, they are coming
from the Italian lakes,

573
00:39:30,633 --> 00:39:32,427
over the pass

574
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:35,013
and winding through the valley

575
00:39:36,014 --> 00:39:37,599
like a serpent.

576
00:39:38,808 --> 00:39:41,728
Therefore, it's a snake.
They call it a snake.

577
00:39:41,811 --> 00:39:45,607
(translated from German)
Cloud Phenomena of Maloja.

578
00:39:52,405 --> 00:39:55,658
(translated from German)
Its harbingers.

579
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:05,668
(translated from German)
The clouds wind up the Maloja Pass.

580
00:40:15,011 --> 00:40:17,514
(translated from German)
The so-called Maloja snake.

581
00:40:28,024 --> 00:40:30,944
ROSA:
Wilhelm was fascinated by this film.

582
00:40:31,027 --> 00:40:35,865
He used to marvel at the fact
that the true nature of the landscape

583
00:40:35,949 --> 00:40:39,702
revealed itself in these images.

584
00:40:41,121 --> 00:40:42,997
Yes, um,

585
00:40:43,081 --> 00:40:46,334
but the black-and-white
creates a distance.

586
00:40:46,417 --> 00:40:48,628
It sets the passing of time.

587
00:40:49,379 --> 00:40:52,340
ROSA:
it's almost a century old.

588
00:40:52,966 --> 00:40:56,845
Actually it comes from very far away.

589
00:40:56,928 --> 00:40:59,722
That's the beauty of it.

590
00:41:13,444 --> 00:41:16,156
-(laughs) Thank you so much.
- Lovely to meet you. Thank you.

591
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:18,074
Thank you.

592
00:41:19,242 --> 00:41:21,077
(Rosa sighs)

593
00:41:21,161 --> 00:41:24,706
I won't promise
to come and see you in London.

594
00:41:24,789 --> 00:41:27,167
I hope you change your mind.
All right?

595
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:29,002
(laughs)

596
00:41:29,085 --> 00:41:31,379
Theater is only theater.

597
00:41:34,549 --> 00:41:35,884
Oh, Maria.

598
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:39,596
It belongs to Wilhelm.

599
00:41:40,763 --> 00:41:42,390
Keep it.

600
00:41:45,101 --> 00:41:47,187
(engine starts)

601
00:42:01,701 --> 00:42:04,370
You were 18 years old.
You weren't a child.

602
00:42:04,454 --> 00:42:07,457
There had to have been
some kind of attraction or...

603
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:10,919
Wilhelm was far from a saint, right?

604
00:42:13,129 --> 00:42:15,131
-(laughs)
- Maybe.

605
00:42:17,592 --> 00:42:19,636
Mmm.

606
00:42:19,719 --> 00:42:23,348
He did choose me,
so he must have felt something, but...

607
00:42:23,431 --> 00:42:25,433
it remained unspoken.

608
00:42:26,726 --> 00:42:29,103
- So you admit -
- And it's not very important.

609
00:42:29,187 --> 00:42:31,397
-(both laughing)
-it's not very important.

610
00:42:31,481 --> 00:42:32,732
Mmm.

611
00:42:32,815 --> 00:42:36,236
If that's not important,
what the fuck is important?

612
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:38,988
All that matters is what's in the movie.

613
00:42:39,072 --> 00:42:40,949
So you admit there was attraction.

614
00:42:42,283 --> 00:42:43,826
Stop.

615
00:42:44,869 --> 00:42:47,163
Why? Was it mutual?

616
00:42:47,247 --> 00:42:48,831
- Yes.
-(both laugh)

617
00:42:48,915 --> 00:42:51,668
No! I don't know. I don't know.

618
00:42:51,751 --> 00:42:53,878
You don't understand.

619
00:42:57,006 --> 00:43:00,885
Yes, I was attracted to Wilhelm,
but it's normal.

620
00:43:00,969 --> 00:43:03,263
I was fine with just feeling attracted

621
00:43:03,346 --> 00:43:06,182
and with the intimacy.

622
00:43:07,558 --> 00:43:09,560
So there was intimacy too.

623
00:43:10,186 --> 00:43:12,397
(laughing)

624
00:43:13,773 --> 00:43:16,234
Stop picking apart every word I say.

625
00:43:16,317 --> 00:43:19,779
Anything more would have
endangered our relationship.

626
00:43:19,862 --> 00:43:21,698
I was, uh -

627
00:43:21,781 --> 00:43:27,287
My intuition told me that it was
far more valuable than desire.

628
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:29,122
L-I feel you.

629
00:43:29,205 --> 00:43:32,959
- You were in love with him.
- Of course I wasn't.

630
00:43:33,042 --> 00:43:35,253
Stop oversimplifying.
It's too easy.

631
00:43:35,336 --> 00:43:37,630
It was less than that.

632
00:43:37,714 --> 00:43:39,215
And it was better.

633
00:43:40,883 --> 00:43:44,721
I don't know anymore. Maybe I only
remember what suits me to remember.

634
00:43:44,804 --> 00:43:46,723
Yeah. I think so.

635
00:43:46,806 --> 00:43:49,684
-'Cause the story changes every time.
- Bitch.

636
00:43:49,767 --> 00:43:51,185
(laughs)

637
00:43:51,269 --> 00:43:53,896
Do you want to christen
a shopping mall in Nanking?

638
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:55,315
No.

639
00:43:55,398 --> 00:43:58,026
How about a series of commercials
for eyeglasses?

640
00:43:58,109 --> 00:44:00,320
- No.
-It's only in Latin America.

641
00:44:00,403 --> 00:44:01,988
- No!
- All right.

642
00:44:02,071 --> 00:44:04,907
Um, there's a Spanish horror flick.
It's pretty gory.

643
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:07,160
You'd be playing a mother superior.

644
00:44:07,243 --> 00:44:09,996
There are werewolves involved,
for whatever reason.

645
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:11,372
No.

646
00:44:11,456 --> 00:44:14,625
An interview with an Italian magazine
targeting active women.

647
00:44:14,709 --> 00:44:16,711
“Seduction After 40.”

648
00:44:18,004 --> 00:44:19,422
No!
(laughs)

649
00:44:19,505 --> 00:44:21,174
But it's the cover.

650
00:44:21,257 --> 00:44:22,842
-(laughing) No!
- Okay.

651
00:44:22,925 --> 00:44:25,720
- Mario Testino is shooting it.
- I don't care.

652
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:29,265
Jo-Ann Ellis' movie
is opening up in Europe.

653
00:44:29,349 --> 00:44:31,267
She wants to meet you.

654
00:44:31,351 --> 00:44:33,561
- When?
- Next week.

655
00:44:35,188 --> 00:44:37,190
Where?

656
00:44:37,273 --> 00:44:40,109
Wherever you want.
She'll come here if you'd like.

657
00:44:41,569 --> 00:44:45,281
- Definitely not here.
- Maybe I'll tell her to book the Waldhaus.

658
00:44:46,824 --> 00:44:48,451
When is her movie opening?

659
00:44:48,534 --> 00:44:51,788
It opened last week.
Have you read a paper lately?

660
00:44:52,622 --> 00:44:54,874
- I'm sorry. You want one?
-(mutters)

661
00:44:55,958 --> 00:44:58,378
it's playing in St. Moritz,
if you want to see it.

662
00:44:58,461 --> 00:45:00,463
I'd rather wait until rehearsals start

663
00:45:00,546 --> 00:45:04,384
and... keep the image of Sigrid
as myself at 18.

664
00:45:04,467 --> 00:45:07,095
I know, I know.
It's a little disturbing.

665
00:45:08,096 --> 00:45:10,014
But I find it more interesting.

666
00:45:10,098 --> 00:45:12,225
Well, I didn't know you at 18,

667
00:45:12,308 --> 00:45:15,269
but I'm almost positive
Jo-Ann's a lot worse.

668
00:45:15,353 --> 00:45:17,230
How can you be so sure?

669
00:45:17,313 --> 00:45:21,150
- Have you googled her?
- Well, I just looked at the pictures.

670
00:45:22,235 --> 00:45:25,405
Well, you should dig a little deeper.

671
00:45:26,406 --> 00:45:29,534
Won't take you long
to find all the naked photos,

672
00:45:29,617 --> 00:45:31,786
the latest updates on her exploits.

673
00:45:31,869 --> 00:45:33,496
Such as?

674
00:45:33,579 --> 00:45:35,289
Her breakup.

675
00:45:36,249 --> 00:45:37,834
With Andrew Beltram?

676
00:45:39,127 --> 00:45:40,753
Any idea who that is?

677
00:45:40,837 --> 00:45:43,005
Not at all.

678
00:45:43,089 --> 00:45:44,966
What world do you live in?

679
00:45:45,049 --> 00:45:47,927
He's, like - He's the biggest star.

680
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:49,429
Says who?

681
00:45:49,512 --> 00:45:51,431
- Preteens.
- Oh.

682
00:45:51,514 --> 00:45:54,267
Hey, there are a shit-ton of them,
so be careful.

683
00:45:55,685 --> 00:45:58,604
Um, he broke up with her because
she wouldn't stop getting wasted

684
00:45:58,688 --> 00:46:00,440
and cheating on him in public.

685
00:46:00,523 --> 00:46:03,484
So she went to his house with a gun,
and he went bat-shit.

686
00:46:03,568 --> 00:46:06,779
Threw her out.
But, like, violently threw her out.

687
00:46:06,863 --> 00:46:09,782
Not exactly the way Klaus described her.

688
00:46:09,866 --> 00:46:12,910
The neighbors had to subdue her
'cause she was, like, shooting up the place.

689
00:46:12,994 --> 00:46:14,871
Apparently it wasn't easy.

690
00:46:14,954 --> 00:46:18,666
She went to rehab to get out of doing time.
She's better now.

691
00:46:18,749 --> 00:46:20,710
According to her press releases.

692
00:46:20,793 --> 00:46:22,420
Well, yeah.

693
00:46:22,503 --> 00:46:26,132
And, uh, the classical training,
the theater background,

694
00:46:26,215 --> 00:46:28,259
is that all bullshit?

695
00:46:28,342 --> 00:46:30,303
No. No, that's all true.

696
00:46:30,386 --> 00:46:32,847
She took off
and just started really fucking up.

697
00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:37,935
Um, I think she probably got jealous
of, like, Hollywood trash.

698
00:46:39,228 --> 00:46:41,814
TMZ deemed her the A-list actress

699
00:46:41,898 --> 00:46:44,317
that dreamt of making it to the Z-list.

700
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,569
You could have told me sooner.

701
00:46:48,738 --> 00:46:50,823
You despise Internet gossip.

702
00:46:50,907 --> 00:46:53,242
This is not gossip.
It's information.

703
00:46:54,076 --> 00:46:57,205
It's celebrity news. it's fun.

704
00:46:57,288 --> 00:46:59,832
- I thought you liked her a lot.
- I do.

705
00:46:59,916 --> 00:47:04,378
I love her. She's not completely antiseptic
like the rest of Hollywood.

706
00:47:04,462 --> 00:47:08,549
Well, you just said
she was a self-destructive crazy girl.

707
00:47:08,633 --> 00:47:11,677
- I didn't say that.
- Sorry. I must have misunderstood then.

708
00:47:11,761 --> 00:47:13,387
Where are my fucking cigarettes?

709
00:47:13,471 --> 00:47:15,348
They're right in front of you.

710
00:47:15,431 --> 00:47:17,058
Where?

711
00:47:18,809 --> 00:47:20,311
- Hello!
- Ah!

712
00:47:22,605 --> 00:47:25,024
She's brave enough to be herself.

713
00:47:25,107 --> 00:47:27,443
At her age,
I think that's pretty fucking cool.

714
00:47:29,695 --> 00:47:32,031
I don't see what's so cool
about fucking around,

715
00:47:32,114 --> 00:47:35,618
getting wasted out of your mind and almost
killing a boyfriend that's sick of you.

716
00:47:35,701 --> 00:47:38,287
I think she's got a bright future.

717
00:47:38,371 --> 00:47:41,791
In fact, I think she's probably
my favorite actress.

718
00:47:41,874 --> 00:47:43,626
Oh.

719
00:47:43,709 --> 00:47:46,212
You mean more than me? Hmm?

720
00:47:47,421 --> 00:47:50,383
No, I - I didn't mean that.

721
00:47:50,466 --> 00:47:52,218
Hmm?

722
00:47:52,301 --> 00:47:54,387
I'm more... what?

723
00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:56,556
Conventional?

724
00:47:56,639 --> 00:47:57,807
Boring.

725
00:47:57,890 --> 00:47:58,933
(scoffs)

726
00:47:59,016 --> 00:48:02,061
And I can't reach her intensity. No.

727
00:48:02,144 --> 00:48:04,230
(exhales)
I didn't say that.

728
00:48:05,064 --> 00:48:06,566
Of course not.

729
00:48:08,651 --> 00:48:10,319
VALENTINE:
Good night.

730
00:48:17,577 --> 00:48:19,328
<i>Hey!</i>

731
00:48:19,412 --> 00:48:20,871
<i>Motherfucker!</i>

732
00:48:20,955 --> 00:48:23,916
<i>Hey! Stop fucking following me, all right?
I'll fucking kill you!</i>

733
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,334
<i>I'll fucking kill you.</i>

734
00:48:31,424 --> 00:48:33,676
<i>So, let me ask you
a tough question.</i>

735
00:48:33,759 --> 00:48:36,095
<i>You were fired from
the Forbidden Planet remake.</i>

736
00:48:36,178 --> 00:48:38,431
<i>- I don't know about that.
-(audience laughing)</i>

737
00:48:38,514 --> 00:48:42,852
You were supposed to play
the old Anne Francis role, Altaira.

738
00:48:42,935 --> 00:48:44,228
- I don't know. Maybe.
-(laughing continues)

739
00:48:44,312 --> 00:48:48,482
And after your DUI arrest,
your studio canceled the contract.

740
00:48:48,566 --> 00:48:50,943
You know, even if that were true,

741
00:48:51,027 --> 00:48:55,031
that would have cost them
an arm and a leg.

742
00:48:55,114 --> 00:48:57,033
- (audience laughing, applauding)
<i>- $0</i> just say it <i>were true.</i>

743
00:48:57,116 --> 00:48:59,035
<i>Which I'm not saying it is.</i>

744
00:48:59,118 --> 00:49:03,539
<i>But, hypothetically speaking, I wouldn't
be able to even talk about it right now</i>

745
00:49:03,623 --> 00:49:06,876
<i>because I would've signed
a confidentiality agreement with the studio.</i>

746
00:49:06,959 --> 00:49:08,210
<i>Sure.</i>

747
00:49:08,294 --> 00:49:11,255
<i>$0 let is imagine
you were arrested for a DUI</i>

748
00:49:11,339 --> 00:49:13,799
<i>and you had insulted the police officer.</i>

749
00:49:13,883 --> 00:49:17,136
No. No, no. That's not hypothetical.
That's a verified fact.

750
00:49:17,219 --> 00:49:21,182
I did get arrested on a DUI,
and I did assault police officers.

751
00:49:21,265 --> 00:49:24,143
So it's the studio's reaction
that's hypothetical.

752
00:49:24,226 --> 00:49:25,353
Exactly.

753
00:49:25,436 --> 00:49:28,648
And their hypothetical
bat-shit crazy response

754
00:49:28,731 --> 00:49:31,525
would have cost them
a hypothetical seven-figure sum,

755
00:49:31,609 --> 00:49:34,403
which I guess I wouldn't
be able to talk about right now, right?

756
00:49:34,487 --> 00:49:38,407
(chuckles) So, will you be appearing
on the remake for Forbidden Planet?

757
00:49:38,491 --> 00:49:40,034
Uh...

758
00:49:40,117 --> 00:49:42,036
- I'd rather die...
-(audience laughing)

759
00:49:42,119 --> 00:49:43,996
very, very slowly

760
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:46,082
of, probably, food poisoning.

Yeah, um, I'm gonna -

766

I'm gonna do a play

uh, with Maria Enders.

Um, she's gonna play the older woman,

769
00:50:24,286 --> 00:50:28,582
and I will play the one
who drives her to suicide.

782
00:50:58,529 --> 00:51:00,740
(reporters laughing)

783
00:51:00,823 --> 00:51:02,908
REPORTER #3:
Klaus Kinski?

784
00:51:02,992 --> 00:51:04,326
- REPORTER #4: <i>Klaus Barbie.</i>
-(laughing continues)

785
00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:05,828
- Oh.
-(audio stops)

786
00:51:09,665 --> 00:51:11,792
(exhales)

787
00:51:11,876 --> 00:51:15,212
(footsteps)

788
00:51:17,506 --> 00:51:20,509
(footsteps continue)

789
00:51:23,971 --> 00:51:26,849
Okay. This is the armchair.

790
00:51:28,184 --> 00:51:29,685
Um...

791
00:51:32,021 --> 00:51:33,564
office door.

792
00:51:35,941 --> 00:51:37,526
Desk.

793
00:51:39,069 --> 00:51:40,654
Okay, go ahead.

794
00:51:47,161 --> 00:51:48,704
Come in.

795
00:51:52,583 --> 00:51:56,337
Sigrid, I asked you here because
your internship is almost over,

796
00:51:57,379 --> 00:52:00,299
and I wanted to congratulate you

797
00:52:00,382 --> 00:52:01,967
personally.

798
00:52:02,051 --> 00:52:04,053
Have a seat.

799
00:52:06,597 --> 00:52:08,724
No, there.
The - The armchair.

800
00:52:12,895 --> 00:52:14,230
(clears throat)

801
00:52:19,401 --> 00:52:22,071
Everyone in my office
sings your praises.

802
00:52:23,614 --> 00:52:26,408
Including the nastiest ones.

803
00:52:26,492 --> 00:52:30,496
The ones who think that I shouldn't have
taken over the company after my father died,

804
00:52:31,497 --> 00:52:34,083
that I'm running it into the ground.

805
00:52:35,584 --> 00:52:38,170
The ones who consider me incompetent,
not because I'm a woman

806
00:52:38,254 --> 00:52:41,048
but because they look at the figures,

807
00:52:41,131 --> 00:52:44,593
and the figures
aren't what they should be.

808
00:52:46,095 --> 00:52:48,889
I know it's true.
It keeps me up at night.

809
00:52:52,434 --> 00:52:54,603
It's been eating away at me.

810
00:52:55,771 --> 00:52:58,357
They've persuaded me,
and now I think they're right.

811
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:01,360
Why are you telling me this?
It's none of my business.

812
00:53:01,443 --> 00:53:03,445
You want people to know?

813
00:53:05,781 --> 00:53:09,201
You think if you arouse their pity,
they'll back off.

814
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:15,207
I've been around a lot less than you,
but in my experience it's quite the opposite.

815
00:53:15,291 --> 00:53:16,625
Wouldn't you agree?

816
00:53:17,793 --> 00:53:19,962
When they tell me about you,

817
00:53:20,754 --> 00:53:23,382
how much they appreciate you,

818
00:53:23,465 --> 00:53:26,051
they're using you to humiliate me.

819
00:53:26,135 --> 00:53:29,013
Shit! I messed up. Fuck!

820
00:53:29,722 --> 00:53:30,890
IFS - What?

821
00:53:30,973 --> 00:53:33,392
- It's to remind -
-it's to remind me!

822
00:53:33,475 --> 00:53:34,810
Oh! Sh-

823
00:53:40,149 --> 00:53:42,818
(Crying)
I hate this fucking scene.

824
00:53:43,736 --> 00:53:46,947
Oh, I have too many memories
of Susan Rosenberg

825
00:53:47,031 --> 00:53:51,243
and the disgust she made me feel
while she was slipping into the skin of this...

826
00:53:51,327 --> 00:53:53,120
defeated woman.

827
00:53:53,203 --> 00:53:56,624
She got such obscene pleasure out of it
night after night.

828
00:53:56,707 --> 00:53:57,791
Wh-Why “defeated”?

829
00:53:57,875 --> 00:54:00,794
Defeated by - by... age,

830
00:54:00,878 --> 00:54:04,048
by - by... her insecurities.

831
00:54:05,382 --> 00:54:07,676
Letting this kid
lead her around by the nose.

832
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:10,971
Come on. That's not -
That's not all there is to it. There's -

833
00:54:11,055 --> 00:54:13,057
I'll start over.

834
00:54:14,308 --> 00:54:18,020
This poor woman is ready to kill herself
before the play even starts.

835
00:54:19,021 --> 00:54:21,982
She's using Sigrid as a weapon,
that's all.

836
00:54:22,066 --> 00:54:23,734
I'll start over.

837
00:54:25,069 --> 00:54:26,654
(exhales)
Okay.

838
00:54:27,529 --> 00:54:29,031
(sniffles)

839
00:54:30,658 --> 00:54:32,701
When they tell me about you,

840
00:54:33,744 --> 00:54:36,038
how much they appreciate you,

841
00:54:38,082 --> 00:54:40,626
it's to remind me how happy they are

842
00:54:40,709 --> 00:54:43,504
to grant you
what they never granted me.

843
00:54:45,255 --> 00:54:47,716
They're using you to humiliate me.

844
00:54:48,801 --> 00:54:52,805
It's not just your youth,
or your powers of seduction.

845
00:54:54,014 --> 00:54:55,474
No, it's your aplomb,

846
00:54:55,557 --> 00:54:57,685
your unshakable self-confidence.

847
00:54:57,768 --> 00:54:59,812
- You don't know me.
- Nothing gets to you.

848
00:54:59,895 --> 00:55:03,273
You radiate... self-confidence.

849
00:55:03,357 --> 00:55:04,733
And you don't?
(scoffs)

850
00:55:04,817 --> 00:55:06,735
I wear a mask.

851
00:55:06,819 --> 00:55:10,322
It works with some people.
Others see right through it.

852
00:55:12,616 --> 00:55:14,660
I can tell which is which right away.

853
00:55:14,743 --> 00:55:17,121
If there's one thing I excel at,

854
00:55:17,204 --> 00:55:19,164
that's reading people's behavior.

855
00:55:19,248 --> 00:55:21,250
So how should I be reading yours?

856
00:55:25,045 --> 00:55:26,588
How do you think?

857
00:55:29,299 --> 00:55:32,344
I don't know. I'm reluctant to say it.
It's pretty clear.

858
00:55:32,428 --> 00:55:34,054
Don't be reluctant.

859
00:55:35,305 --> 00:55:39,184
Helena nervously crosses and uncrosses
her legs, reaches for a cigarette.

860
00:55:39,268 --> 00:55:40,769
(giggles)

861
00:55:42,021 --> 00:55:44,690
You talk about your insecurities.

862
00:55:44,773 --> 00:55:47,359
Your vulnerabilities.

863
00:55:47,443 --> 00:55:50,988
You open up to me,
and I'm not exactly sure why.

864
00:55:53,032 --> 00:55:56,076
It's as if you're expecting something.
Can I be frank?

865
00:56:00,873 --> 00:56:03,876
I don't think it's company figures
that are keeping you up at night.

866
00:56:03,959 --> 00:56:06,378
- What's keeping me up then?
- Desire.

867
00:56:08,797 --> 00:56:10,382
For me, I think.

868
00:56:10,466 --> 00:56:14,887
I noticed it the second you hired me,
and I'm sorry, but I've had fun playing with it.

869
00:56:16,305 --> 00:56:17,806
You've let me play with it.

870
00:56:17,890 --> 00:56:19,308
“Fun.”

871
00:56:20,142 --> 00:56:22,561
What a strange word.

872
00:56:22,644 --> 00:56:24,229
Not what I was expecting.

873
00:56:24,313 --> 00:56:26,648
Oh, this text is impossible.

874
00:56:26,732 --> 00:56:29,818
Oh, my God!
So now the play is bad?

875
00:56:29,902 --> 00:56:33,572
No. But everything is weighted
to make Sigrid look good.

876
00:56:34,990 --> 00:56:37,326
(exhales)
I didn't read it like that.

877
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,746
I see her arrogance, her cruelty,

878
00:56:40,829 --> 00:56:43,248
and Helena's humanity.

879
00:56:43,332 --> 00:56:45,459
She's able to talk about her own pain.

880
00:56:45,542 --> 00:56:47,252
It's moving.

881
00:56:47,336 --> 00:56:49,004
I'll start over.

882
00:56:52,299 --> 00:56:53,842
“Fun.”

883
00:56:54,927 --> 00:56:56,678
What a strange word.

884
00:56:58,514 --> 00:57:00,682
Not what I was expecting.

885
00:57:01,517 --> 00:57:03,102
She's such a stupid cunt.

886
00:57:03,185 --> 00:57:04,478
Oh.

887
00:57:04,561 --> 00:57:07,356
And I didn't expect you
to talk about desire either.

888
00:57:08,232 --> 00:57:10,317
Let me be frank now.

889
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,069
It makes me uncomfortable.

890
00:57:13,153 --> 00:57:16,532
And it forces me
to see you differently.

891
00:57:16,615 --> 00:57:18,742
And that gets under your skin.

892
00:57:20,035 --> 00:57:21,537
Pause.

893
00:57:22,371 --> 00:57:23,747
You can tell me.

894
00:57:23,831 --> 00:57:26,542
Stands, lights a cigarette.

895
00:57:27,709 --> 00:57:30,337
In fact, it's exactly
what you want to say, so say it.

896
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:32,422
Yes. it's true.

897
00:57:32,506 --> 00:57:34,508
You get under my skin.

898
00:57:36,093 --> 00:57:41,014
I wanted to ask you to stay on
and become my personal assistant.

899
00:57:41,098 --> 00:57:42,975
(chuckles)
She doesn't accept.

900
00:57:43,058 --> 00:57:45,477
- I mean, she does accept!
-(laughing)

901
00:57:45,561 --> 00:57:48,063
Without hesitation, she accepts.

902
00:57:50,107 --> 00:57:54,027

904
00:58:07,791 --> 00:58:10,794
Oh, I've been feeling sick all morning.

905
00:58:15,924 --> 00:58:17,551
<i>L</i> feel dirty.

906
00:58:19,219 --> 00:58:22,598
I don't like Helena, no matter
how much humanity you see in her.

907
00:58:23,807 --> 00:58:25,809
- Want some?
- No, thanks.

908
00:58:28,437 --> 00:58:31,190
Or maybe because of that humanity.
I don't know. I don't care.

909
00:58:31,273 --> 00:58:35,194
I don't feel good in her skin. I don't know
why I have to inflict this on myself.

910
00:58:35,277 --> 00:58:36,945
Then don't do it.

911
00:58:37,029 --> 00:58:39,865
That's what I'm saying.
I'm not doing it.

913
00:59:10,729 --> 00:59:13,440
I'd like to take the car tonight.

914
00:59:13,523 --> 00:59:16,443
Berndt rented a house on Lake Como
with some friends.

915
00:59:16,526 --> 00:59:18,153
That's pretty far.

916
00:59:19,029 --> 00:59:22,324
I mean, it's... two hours by car.

917
00:59:23,784 --> 00:59:26,787
If I left at 6:00,
I could probably be back by sunrise.

918
00:59:28,830 --> 00:59:31,541
- Would you be okay alone?
- Yeah.

919
00:59:31,625 --> 00:59:34,962
Yeah, just - just be careful
on the mountain roads at night.

920
00:59:37,673 --> 00:59:39,841
Are you involved with him?

921
00:59:40,926 --> 00:59:43,971
I mean, I-is this a thing now?

922
00:59:45,847 --> 00:59:47,432
I like him.

923
00:59:47,516 --> 00:59:49,393
Oh, you like him.

924
00:59:50,852 --> 00:59:52,604
That's all <i>we'll</i> get.

(chuckles)

926
00:59:55,023 --> 00:59:56,525
You're jealous.

927
00:59:57,734 --> 00:59:59,278
Jealous?

928
01:00:00,487 --> 01:00:02,990
I don't know. Of my time.

929
01:00:04,074 --> 01:00:05,575
My thoughts.

930
01:00:06,576 --> 01:00:08,328
- Maybe my affection.
- No.

931
01:00:08,412 --> 01:00:09,913
I'm not jealous.

932
01:00:09,997 --> 01:00:12,249
I'm thrilled
that you have a boyfriend.

933
01:00:12,332 --> 01:00:14,584
There haven't been that many,

934
01:00:14,668 --> 01:00:17,671
and when there is one,
you burn through him pretty fast.

935
01:00:18,714 --> 01:00:20,132
-(Maria laughs)
- I'll tell you.

936
01:00:20,215 --> 01:00:21,967
No, you won't.

937
01:00:22,050 --> 01:00:25,470
And I never know if I should believe
what little you do tell me.

938
01:00:26,346 --> 01:00:27,848
That's up to you.

01:00:33,061 --> 01:00:36,064

Uh-oh. Don't get jealous.

01:12:37,785 --> 01:12:41,080
That's why you admire what she does.

1098
01:12:42,373 --> 01:12:43,875
Yeah.

1099
01:12:43,958 --> 01:12:48,171
You know, I think that when you watch her
in a movie like the one we saw tonight,

1100
01:12:48,254 --> 01:12:51,966
there is... there is no distance there.

1101
01:12:52,050 --> 01:12:56,054
It's normal.
It's, uh... her culture. Right?

1102
01:12:56,137 --> 01:12:58,056
Yeah, agreed.

1103
01:12:58,139 --> 01:13:01,392
- What's wrong with my acting?
- Nothing.

1104
01:13:01,476 --> 01:13:04,437
What do I need to do
to make you admire me?

1105
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:06,647
Do I think too much? Huh?

1106
01:13:06,731 --> 01:13:08,566
Am I too classical?

1107
01:13:08,649 --> 01:13:11,277
Not liberated like Jo-Ann?

1108
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:14,280
You're here to talk to me,
so start talking.

1109
01:13:14,363 --> 01:13:15,406
Hmm?

1110
01:13:15,490 --> 01:13:18,117
I don't know. You...

1111
01:13:18,201 --> 01:13:21,037
You can't be as accomplished as you are

1112
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:23,873
and as well-rounded as an actress
as you are

1113
01:13:24,749 --> 01:13:27,251
and still expect to hold on
to the privileges of youth.

1114
01:13:27,335 --> 01:13:28,795
It just doesn't work like that.

1115
01:13:28,878 --> 01:13:30,755
Oh!

1116
01:13:30,838 --> 01:13:32,590
So I'm allowed to not be old,

1117
01:13:32,673 --> 01:13:35,593
as long as I don't want to be young,
is that it?

1118
01:13:35,676 --> 01:13:38,179
Yeah. I don't know. I guess so.

1119
01:13:39,347 --> 01:13:41,349
Yes. Totally. Well put.

1120
01:13:45,436 --> 01:13:46,938
Fuck.

1121
01:13:52,944 --> 01:13:55,655
I think, maybe, good night.

1122
01:13:55,738 --> 01:13:57,240
(exhales)

1123
01:13:58,407 --> 01:14:00,159
Wait, wait! Wait.

1124
01:14:00,243 --> 01:14:02,537
Hey. Hey-

1125
01:14:03,454 --> 01:14:05,998
You - You didn't tell me
how it went with Berndt.

1126
01:14:08,334 --> 01:14:11,712
Yeah, well, you know, um, fuck Berndt.
(laughs)

1127
01:14:12,505 --> 01:14:14,298
I thought you wouldn't believe me anyway.

1128
01:14:14,382 --> 01:14:16,050
Try.

1129
01:14:16,134 --> 01:14:18,177
Maybe you'll manage to persuade me.

1130
01:14:18,803 --> 01:14:20,805
I'm... exhausted.

1131
01:14:20,888 --> 01:14:23,057
I don't know. I don't have the energy.

1132
01:14:24,517 --> 01:14:26,519
Okay. Good night.

1133
01:14:27,436 --> 01:14:29,272
Oh, I spoke to Jay.

1134
01:14:29,355 --> 01:14:32,358
He doesn't think
he can get me out of the contract.

1135
01:14:34,819 --> 01:14:36,487
Yeah, I figured.

1136
01:14:41,868 --> 01:14:44,537
Please knock when you enter my office.

1137
01:14:45,997 --> 01:14:47,498
You summoned me.

1138
01:14:47,582 --> 01:14:50,084
I didn't summon you.
I asked you to come.

1139
01:14:50,168 --> 01:14:51,711
What's the difference?

1140
01:14:51,794 --> 01:14:55,590
There's differences. When I summon you,
it's for professional reasons.

1141
01:14:55,673 --> 01:14:58,551
When I ask you to come,
it's for... personal reasons.

1142
01:14:58,634 --> 01:15:00,845
- So it's personal.
- Yes.

1143
01:15:00,928 --> 01:15:02,847
All the more reason not to knock.

1144
01:15:02,930 --> 01:15:05,474
Everyone knocks
before coming into my office.

1145
01:15:05,558 --> 01:15:09,061
I could have been in a meeting
or in a private call.

1146
01:15:09,145 --> 01:15:11,814
I'm surprised Josephine let you through.

1147
01:15:11,898 --> 01:15:14,817
I told Josephine it didn't concern her.
She understood perfectly well.

1148
01:15:14,901 --> 01:15:17,195
Understood what?

1149
01:15:17,278 --> 01:15:19,363
That we have a personal relationship.

1150
01:15:19,447 --> 01:15:22,074
Since when does Josephine know

1151
01:15:22,158 --> 01:15:24,911
that we have what you call
a personal relationship?

1152
01:15:24,994 --> 01:15:27,330
Don't be stupid. She has eyes.

1153
01:15:27,413 --> 01:15:30,833
- You want me to draw you a picture?
- Please don't draw me a picture.

1154
01:15:31,792 --> 01:15:34,712
I thought it was between you and me.

1155
01:15:34,795 --> 01:15:36,297
I'm appalled.

1156
01:15:37,924 --> 01:15:39,425
Who else knows?

1157
01:15:41,886 --> 01:15:44,013
I don't know,

1158
01:15:44,096 --> 01:15:47,308
but in an office,
word gets around pretty fast.

1159
01:15:47,391 --> 01:15:49,227
You hired me as your personal assistant.

1160
01:15:49,310 --> 01:15:51,312
I'm under-qualified.

1161
01:15:52,813 --> 01:15:55,983
Everyone understood right away
that I could come and go as I pleased.

1162
01:15:56,067 --> 01:15:59,445
I created a vacuum around you,
to keep my hold on you.

1163
01:15:59,528 --> 01:16:01,906
Created a vacuum...

1164
01:16:03,407 --> 01:16:05,076
to keep your hold.

1165
01:16:09,830 --> 01:16:11,916
Don't you realize?

1166
01:16:11,999 --> 01:16:13,501
No.

1167
01:16:13,584 --> 01:16:15,503
I don't see things that way.

1168
01:16:15,586 --> 01:16:18,005
Then everyone else got it before you did.

1169
01:16:34,689 --> 01:16:37,233
MARIA: Shall we stop here?

1170
01:16:37,316 --> 01:16:38,818
Sure.

1171
01:16:42,405 --> 01:16:44,907
Can you repeat Sigrid's last lines?

1172
01:16:45,700 --> 01:16:47,201
(grunts)

1173
01:16:50,871 --> 01:16:53,082
“Then everyone else got it before you did.

1174
01:16:55,376 --> 01:16:57,753
Helena pauses and stares at Sigrid.”

1175
01:16:59,255 --> 01:17:01,757
What started at my place that night...

1176
01:17:03,592 --> 01:17:05,553
I won't deny a thing.

1177
01:17:08,139 --> 01:17:10,182
I probably wanted it. I don't know.

1178
01:17:12,184 --> 01:17:14,687
It's as if you put this idea in my head.

1179
01:17:15,229 --> 01:17:18,941
If you allowed yourself to be manipulated,
it's because you wanted it.

1180
01:17:20,776 --> 01:17:23,029
- I don't want anything.
- Stop!

1181
01:17:23,112 --> 01:17:25,364
I can't stand
that condescending tone of yours.

1182
01:17:25,448 --> 01:17:28,242
You want to be clear? This can't go on.

1183
01:17:28,326 --> 01:17:30,828
- Whatever you say.
-It's - I've thought it over.

1184
01:17:30,911 --> 01:17:32,830
<i>-It's finished.
- So I'll</i> leave.

1185
01:17:32,913 --> 01:17:36,584
No, you'll stay. You do your job well.
I have no complaints.

1186
01:17:39,003 --> 01:17:41,505
- I stay, and it's finished.
- We stop.

1187
01:17:41,589 --> 01:17:43,758
- And act as if it never happened.
- Yes.

1188
01:17:43,841 --> 01:17:46,677
Helena, you're not capable of that.

1189
01:17:49,722 --> 01:17:52,266
If I stay, nothing will change.
You'll be my lover.

1190
01:17:53,351 --> 01:17:54,352
No.

1191
01:17:54,435 --> 01:17:58,189
You will. And <i>I'll</i> keep
driving everyone else away.

1192
01:17:58,272 --> 01:18:00,274
I'll have a tighter
and tighter hold on you.

1193
01:18:00,358 --> 01:18:02,360
- Is that what you want?
- No, not necessarily.

1194
01:18:02,443 --> 01:18:04,528
I'm just telling you how it is.

1195
01:18:04,612 --> 01:18:07,239
But if you want me to leave,
just say so.

1196
01:18:12,912 --> 01:18:15,331
She doesn't speak. Say it.

1197
01:18:15,414 --> 01:18:17,291
It's time.

1198
01:18:17,375 --> 01:18:19,502
End of act 2.

1199
01:18:24,048 --> 01:18:26,801
- You hungry?
- Yeah.

1200
01:18:32,139 --> 01:18:34,308
(laughing)

1201
01:18:46,237 --> 01:18:48,572
(laughing)
“You'll be my lover.

1202
01:18:51,325 --> 01:18:54,203
I'll keep driving everyone else away.

1203
01:18:54,286 --> 01:18:56,789
I'll have a tighter
and tighter hold on you.”

1204
01:18:56,872 --> 01:18:59,834
Honestly,
you don't find this ridiculous?

1205
01:18:59,917 --> 01:19:02,920
- Why, 'cause she speaks brutally?
- No, because it's phony.

1206
01:19:03,003 --> 01:19:04,505
I don't believe it.

1207
01:19:06,173 --> 01:19:09,051
So you don't think people can be blinded
by their own emotions.

1208
01:19:09,135 --> 01:19:11,679
No, I do, but not to that extent.

1209
01:19:11,762 --> 01:19:13,681
It's too theoretical.

1210
01:19:15,057 --> 01:19:16,809
Even a little stupid.

1211
01:19:18,853 --> 01:19:20,312
It's theater.

1212
01:19:20,396 --> 01:19:23,858
It's an interpretation of life.
It can be truer than life itself.

1213
01:19:24,859 --> 01:19:28,237
Sigrid puts Helena's desires into words.
She says the unspoken.

1214
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:30,448
She... formulates it.

1215
01:19:30,531 --> 01:19:32,908
- Cruelly.
- Okay, cruelly.

1216
01:19:32,992 --> 01:19:35,578
Yeah, cruelly,
because she's up to no good.

1217
01:19:35,661 --> 01:19:37,621
You're not in the character's skin. You -

1218
01:19:37,705 --> 01:19:41,292
I have no choice. I have to be them.
I have to identify with them.

1219
01:19:41,375 --> 01:19:43,127
When it's phony, I - I feel it.

1220
01:19:43,210 --> 01:19:44,712
Viscerally.

1221
01:19:46,046 --> 01:19:48,799
(sighs)
it can be, uh...

1222
01:19:48,883 --> 01:19:51,552
literary, but still be true.

1223
01:19:53,888 --> 01:19:56,474
I can feel the difference.
I can hear it.

1224
01:20:21,415 --> 01:20:23,792
(bell jangling)

1225
01:20:27,838 --> 01:20:29,507
(goat bleating)

1226
01:20:32,927 --> 01:20:34,428
(goat bleats)

1227
01:20:43,687 --> 01:20:45,022
- Maria.
- Hmm?

1228
01:20:45,105 --> 01:20:47,483
We've got to go.
Sun's about to go down.

1229
01:20:53,739 --> 01:20:55,824
I know a shortcut a little further up.

1230
01:20:55,908 --> 01:20:59,787
It's steep, but, uh,
it'll take us straight to Val Fex.

1231
01:21:00,579 --> 01:21:03,415
- I thought Val Fex was that way.
- No,no,no.

1232
01:21:07,878 --> 01:21:10,047
VALENTINE:
You're sure this is the right path, huh?

1233
01:21:10,130 --> 01:21:13,384
MARIA: Well... actually, not really.

1234
01:21:13,467 --> 01:21:15,636
I'm not even sure it's a path.

1235
01:21:15,719 --> 01:21:18,722
Or we might have forked off
somewhere, I don't know.

1236
01:21:19,848 --> 01:21:21,809
I think you're right.

1237
01:21:23,102 --> 01:21:27,439
I'm pretty sure Val Fex
is, um... not this way.

1238
01:21:30,317 --> 01:21:32,987
Anyway, we're heading down.
We'll end up somewhere.

1239
01:21:35,614 --> 01:21:38,117
I think this road takes us to Maloja.

1240
01:21:40,452 --> 01:21:42,788
What do we do when we get to Maloja?

1241
01:21:43,914 --> 01:21:45,833
We take the bus.

1242
01:21:50,462 --> 01:21:54,341
You know, you don't have to keep me on
if you find my ideas simplistic.

1243
01:21:56,510 --> 01:21:58,178
What makes you say that?

1244
01:21:59,179 --> 01:22:03,684
If you find my point of view...
uninteresting, I -

1245
01:22:05,894 --> 01:22:08,480
I don't really know what I'm doing here. I...

1246
01:22:09,523 --> 01:22:12,651
I can run lines with you,
but I don't really see the point.

1247
01:22:12,735 --> 01:22:14,278
You can find anyone to do that.

1248
01:22:14,361 --> 01:22:17,948
No, all I'm saying is that thinking about a text
is different from living it.

1249
01:22:18,032 --> 01:22:20,034
It's nothing against you.

1250
01:22:20,117 --> 01:22:21,785
Y-You...

1251
01:22:21,869 --> 01:22:23,871
You hate the play. You hate her.

1252
01:22:27,333 --> 01:22:29,793
You don't have to take it out on me.

1253
01:22:29,877 --> 01:22:31,712
I'm just doing my job.

1254
01:22:45,601 --> 01:22:46,894
Ready?

1255
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:50,022
- You're ready?
- Yes!

1256
01:22:57,404 --> 01:22:59,073
Don't lie to me!

1257
01:22:59,156 --> 01:23:03,202
You received a confirmation
for a flight to Tokyo.

1258
01:23:03,285 --> 01:23:05,996
You're reading my mail now?
Aren't you ashamed?

1259
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:08,540
I haven't felt shame in a long time.

1260
01:23:08,624 --> 01:23:10,834
I went through all your desk drawers,
your notebooks,

1261
01:23:10,918 --> 01:23:13,337
and I'm doing it
because you want to leave me.

1262
01:23:13,420 --> 01:23:15,339
Now I know when and how.

1263
01:23:15,422 --> 01:23:19,134
Helena is restless.
Sigrid remains poised.

1264
01:23:19,218 --> 01:23:21,011
All you had to do was ask.

1265
01:23:21,095 --> 01:23:24,682
Yes, I accepted a job in Tokyo.
A pharmaceutical lab.

1266
01:23:24,765 --> 01:23:27,685
I think <i>it'll</i> be much more interesting
than the work I'm doing here.

1267
01:23:27,768 --> 01:23:30,521
More interesting
than what you're doing here?

1268
01:23:30,604 --> 01:23:34,400
Haven't I given into
every demand you've made?

1269
01:23:34,483 --> 01:23:38,362
No other company would have given you
that kind of responsibility and power!

1270
01:23:38,445 --> 01:23:40,322
Exactly.

1271
01:23:40,406 --> 01:23:42,616
It's weighing on me.

1272
01:23:42,700 --> 01:23:44,785
I know this place in and out.

1273
01:23:44,868 --> 01:23:49,164
The world moves. I want to feel that.
I want to be a part of it.

1274
01:23:49,915 --> 01:23:52,876
I want to travel.
Switzerland's too provincial.

1275
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:55,045
(screams)

1276
01:23:55,129 --> 01:23:57,840
(crying)

1277
01:24:01,969 --> 01:24:03,971
(crying continues)

1278
01:24:05,723 --> 01:24:08,892
She takes a deep breath
and regains her composure.

1279
01:24:08,976 --> 01:24:11,103
And with me you don't feel free?

1280
01:24:11,729 --> 01:24:14,273
You've become too dependent on me.

1281
01:24:14,356 --> 01:24:17,234
It's unhealthy.
What do I get in return?

1282
01:24:17,317 --> 01:24:19,737
I give you whatever you want.
You know that.

1283
01:24:19,820 --> 01:24:21,071
Oh.

1284
01:24:21,155 --> 01:24:24,575
Like a job at a dead-end company
that's about to go down the drain?

1285
01:24:24,658 --> 01:24:26,994
How could you say... a thing like that?

1286
01:24:27,077 --> 01:24:29,288
Open your eyes, my poor Helena.

1287
01:24:29,371 --> 01:24:30,914
I'm not your poor Helena!

1288
01:24:30,998 --> 01:24:35,711
- Nothing I've learned here is of any use to me.
- I'm not your poor Helena!

1289
01:24:35,794 --> 01:24:37,755
You'll never last.

1290
01:24:37,838 --> 01:24:40,382
You should listen to what
the bankers are telling you.

1291
01:24:40,466 --> 01:24:41,925
And your board members.

1292
01:24:42,009 --> 01:24:45,179
That's not true! For God's sake.

1293
01:24:46,597 --> 01:24:50,225
Oh, this relationship
between these women, it's - it's...

1294
01:24:50,893 --> 01:24:52,644
Fuck. it's disturbing.

1295
01:24:52,728 --> 01:24:54,229
MARIA: Disturbing.

1296
01:24:54,313 --> 01:24:56,231
Nowadays people say “disturbing”
about everything,

1297
01:24:56,315 --> 01:24:58,984
even the most conventional ideas.
(laughing)

1298
01:24:59,067 --> 01:25:02,112
Anyway, it's, uh - it's a male fantasy.

1299
01:25:02,196 --> 01:25:04,531
Uh, no, it's not.

1300
01:25:04,615 --> 01:25:07,159
I don't know why
I should be helping to bring it alive.

1301
01:25:07,242 --> 01:25:10,329
I bet you weren't saying stuff like this
when you were playing Sigrid.

1302
01:25:10,412 --> 01:25:12,831
I was a kid when I was playing Sigrid.

1303
01:25:12,915 --> 01:25:16,293
L-I wasn't asking those kind of questions.

1304
01:25:16,376 --> 01:25:18,295
Like Jo-Ann in her science-fiction film.

1305
01:25:18,378 --> 01:25:20,005
Yeah, probably.

1306
01:25:22,090 --> 01:25:24,635
Don't you want to get that innocence back?

1307
01:25:24,718 --> 01:25:26,470
You can't get innocent twice.

1308
01:25:26,553 --> 01:25:28,096
You can.

1309
01:25:28,180 --> 01:25:30,891
If you just accepted Helena
the way you accepted Sigrid.

1310
01:25:30,974 --> 01:25:34,478
Obviously, it's easier to relate to strength
rather than weakness.

1311
01:25:34,561 --> 01:25:36,730
Youth is better than maturity.

1312
01:25:36,814 --> 01:25:39,942
Cruelty is cool, suffering sucks.

1313
01:25:41,568 --> 01:25:43,320
But she's...

1314
01:25:43,403 --> 01:25:45,906
She's mature and she's innocent.

1315
01:25:45,989 --> 01:25:48,909
She's innocent in her own way.
That's what I like about her.

1316
01:25:54,581 --> 01:25:56,708
I'll make some coffee.
You want some?

1317
01:25:59,127 --> 01:26:01,505
Cruelty is cool and suffering sucks.

1318
01:26:20,190 --> 01:26:22,693
You didn't answer me.

1319
01:26:22,776 --> 01:26:27,072
You have your interpretation of the play.
I think mine's just confusing you.

1320
01:26:28,448 --> 01:26:30,117
It's frustrating me.

1321
01:26:31,118 --> 01:26:32,619
It's uncomfortable.

1322
01:26:32,703 --> 01:26:34,371
It's not good.

1323
01:26:42,921 --> 01:26:44,214
Stay.

1324
01:26:44,298 --> 01:26:45,799
(sighs)

1325
01:26:48,135 --> 01:26:49,970
No. No.

1326
01:26:50,053 --> 01:26:51,972
Please, stay.

1327
01:26:53,515 --> 01:26:55,183
I need you.

1328
01:27:10,324 --> 01:27:12,826
<i>N</i> (classical)

1329
01:27:21,752 --> 01:27:23,754
<i>N</i> (continues)

1330
01:27:43,523 --> 01:27:45,484
(whispers, inaudible)

1331
01:27:48,737 --> 01:27:50,739
(whispers, inaudible)

1332
01:28:35,784 --> 01:28:37,160
Thank you.

1333
01:28:37,244 --> 01:28:40,747
I prefer 18th-century music to any other.

1334
01:28:40,831 --> 01:28:42,874
It's so bright and lively.

1335
01:28:42,958 --> 01:28:46,920
Yeah, me too. Romantic music
is so sad and depressing.

1336
01:28:47,004 --> 01:28:49,881
But I'd rather listen to rock music
any day of the week though.

1337
01:28:49,965 --> 01:28:51,550
- Even the worst.
- Not me.

1338
01:28:51,633 --> 01:28:54,011
I've heard too much of it.
I'm sick of it.

1339
01:28:54,094 --> 01:28:56,513
Well, you're such a snob.

1340
01:28:56,596 --> 01:29:00,475
No. Tastes can get worn out,
kind of like desire.

1341
01:29:02,352 --> 01:29:05,480
I've never listened to Handel properly.
I think he's excellent.

1342
01:29:05,564 --> 01:29:08,108
I haven't been this moved
by music in ages.

1343
01:29:09,943 --> 01:29:11,653
You're making fun of me.

1344
01:29:11,737 --> 01:29:13,655
I'm not, but I just...

1345
01:29:15,282 --> 01:29:18,618
I find it really cute that you're trying
to fit in with my ideas.

1346
01:29:18,702 --> 01:29:20,996
But you know I'm not a music whiz.

1347
01:29:21,079 --> 01:29:23,874
I mean, besides what my family
practically spoon-fed me,

1348
01:29:23,957 --> 01:29:25,876
which is incredibly specialized,

1349
01:29:25,959 --> 01:29:28,587
I don't know a thing about music.

1350
01:29:30,630 --> 01:29:32,132
Thank you.

1351
01:29:32,883 --> 01:29:35,469
So, how'd it go with your wife?

1352
01:29:35,552 --> 01:29:37,262
Really well.

1353
01:29:37,345 --> 01:29:39,723
No, I'm kidding. It was horrible.

1354
01:29:39,806 --> 01:29:44,061
But, you know, she's... she's not the type
to wear her heart on her sleeve.

1355
01:29:44,144 --> 01:29:46,146
I think she was expecting it.

1356
01:29:46,229 --> 01:29:48,982
- Did you tell her about me?
- No, I said, you know,

1357
01:29:49,066 --> 01:29:52,652
I'd be going off on my own to write my book
and wouldn't be back.

1358
01:29:52,736 --> 01:29:54,488
She must be suspecting something.

1359
01:29:54,571 --> 01:29:56,823
She has no idea
you and I know each other.

1360
01:29:56,907 --> 01:29:59,367
Well, she will.
I mean, once it hits the tabloids.

1361
01:29:59,451 --> 01:30:02,746
- They're not going to find us here.
- They're going to find us anywhere.

1362
01:30:02,829 --> 01:30:04,498
It's their job, you know.

1363
01:30:04,581 --> 01:30:06,583
Did you say anything to Maria Enders?

1364
01:30:06,666 --> 01:30:09,920
Just that I would be taking advantage
of my press tour and come say hi.

1365
01:30:10,003 --> 01:30:12,089
She didn't find that strange?

1366
01:30:12,172 --> 01:30:16,176
I talked to her assistant, and she didn't
seem to question it, so I guess not.

1367
01:30:27,229 --> 01:30:29,439
♪♪ (jazz, faint)

1368
01:30:31,525 --> 01:30:33,527
Hey. There she is, just there.

1369
01:30:34,027 --> 01:30:36,113

- Hi. Hi.

1370
01:30:36,196 --> 01:30:38,448
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

1371
01:30:38,532 --> 01:30:40,117
- Wow.
- What?

1372
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:43,453
- I never would have recognized you.
- Really?

1373
01:30:43,537 --> 01:30:46,373
I mean, if you've only seen me
on the Internet or in movies,

1374
01:30:46,456 --> 01:30:48,959
-that's not really a big surprise.
- Still, it's a little weird.

1375
01:30:49,042 --> 01:30:51,920
You, on the other hand,
look exactly like all your roles.

1376
01:30:52,003 --> 01:30:54,131
(chuckles)
I hope not all of them.

1377
01:30:54,214 --> 01:30:56,800
No,no,no.
Only the better, only the better ones.

1378
01:30:56,883 --> 01:30:58,802
Rest assured,
you don't look like Nemesis.

1379
01:30:58,885 --> 01:31:02,097

- This is Chris. He's a... He's a novelist.

1380
01:31:02,180 --> 01:31:04,474
Hi. Nice to meet you, Chris.
My assistant.

1381
01:31:04,558 --> 01:31:07,144
Hey. it's so good to meet both of you.
Seriously.

1382
01:31:07,227 --> 01:31:08,520
Yeah.

1383
01:31:08,603 --> 01:31:11,857
Hello. May I get you anything to drink?

1384
01:31:11,940 --> 01:31:13,859
- A cognac for me, please.
- Yeah?

1385
01:31:13,942 --> 01:31:15,610
<i>- I'll</i> have the same.
- Okay.

1386
01:31:15,694 --> 01:31:17,404
- I'm fine, thanks.
- All right.

1387
01:31:17,487 --> 01:31:19,489
What herbal teas do you have?

1388
01:31:19,573 --> 01:31:22,325
We have vervain, mint and chamomile.

1389
01:31:22,409 --> 01:31:24,578
- Um, can I get a chamomile, please?
- Yeah, sure.

1390
01:31:24,661 --> 01:31:26,163
Thank you.

1391
01:31:27,414 --> 01:31:32,502
(sighs) I don't think you understand
how much of an honor this is for me.

1392
01:31:32,586 --> 01:31:34,963
When I was 15, I saw...

1393
01:31:35,046 --> 01:31:38,341
Oh, my God, the movie you did
with the CIA and Harrison Ford.

1394
01:31:38,425 --> 01:31:40,010
- I'm so sorry. I'm blanking.
- Um...

1395
01:31:40,093 --> 01:31:43,221
<i>Beetle on Its Back.
- A Beetle on Its Back, with Harrison</i> Ford.

1396
01:31:43,305 --> 01:31:44,764
You blew my mind.

1397
01:31:44,848 --> 01:31:46,808
You -You...

1398
01:31:46,892 --> 01:31:48,518
You were the epitome of class.

1399
01:31:48,602 --> 01:31:51,271
You were everything
I ever wanted to be as an actress.

1400
01:31:51,354 --> 01:31:53,773
And I mean, the way that you
battled those politicians

1401
01:31:53,857 --> 01:31:56,359
and the military brass men,
it was captivating.

1402
01:31:56,443 --> 01:31:59,863
It was my first Hollywood film.
I was a little lost.

1403
01:31:59,946 --> 01:32:03,241
Um... Sydney Pollack was really nice,

1404
01:32:03,325 --> 01:32:05,702
but sometimes I didn't understand
what he was saying,

1405
01:32:05,785 --> 01:32:07,579
so I was too shy to ask.

1406
01:32:07,662 --> 01:32:10,165
But fortunately,
Harrison was there to help.

1407
01:32:10,248 --> 01:32:12,542
-(laughing)
- A lot.

1408
01:32:14,377 --> 01:32:16,046
Well, then of course, after that,

1409
01:32:16,129 --> 01:32:19,466
I begged my parents to let me
see you on stage, in The <i>Seagull.</i>

1410
01:32:19,549 --> 01:32:23,386
And they didn't know who you were
before then, because...

1411
01:32:23,470 --> 01:32:25,347
well, they kind of hate movies.

1412
01:32:25,430 --> 01:32:28,225
- Well, I hope they tolerate the theater.
- No,no,no.

1413
01:32:28,308 --> 01:32:31,937
They don't just tolerate the theater.
I mean, they're absolutely in love with it.

1414
01:32:32,020 --> 01:32:34,689
In fact, they see everything and... and...

1415
01:32:34,773 --> 01:32:36,733
Well, you know,
when they saw your performance,

1416
01:32:36,816 --> 01:32:39,402
they said it was the best Nina
they'd ever seen.

1417
01:32:39,486 --> 01:32:41,571
And that meant a lot to me.

1418
01:32:41,655 --> 01:32:43,823
Because after -
You know, before that I -

1419
01:32:43,907 --> 01:32:47,244
I'd never been able to tell them
that I wanted to be an actress.

1420
01:32:47,327 --> 01:32:50,080
But because of you,
I could pursue my vocation.

1421
01:32:50,163 --> 01:32:52,332
I prefer your early French films.

1422
01:32:52,415 --> 01:32:54,668
There was a cycle at the ICA in London.

1423
01:32:54,751 --> 01:32:56,753
I saw almost all of them.

1424
01:32:56,836 --> 01:32:59,256
And you came.
You probably don't remember.

1425
01:32:59,339 --> 01:33:02,008
Oh, I remember perfectly well.

1426
01:33:02,092 --> 01:33:05,762
I was fascinated by how freely
you spoke about your work.

1427
01:33:05,845 --> 01:33:09,975
And, um, yet someone asked you
if you had any regrets,

1428
01:33:10,058 --> 01:33:13,478
and you said, “We're not allowed
to regret anything.

1429
01:33:13,561 --> 01:33:16,773
If we're sincere, then we're
the sum total of our experiences,

1430
01:33:16,856 --> 01:33:18,358
with no exceptions.”

1431
01:33:19,067 --> 01:33:20,694
I said that?

1432
01:33:20,777 --> 01:33:22,988
Well, not word for word.
Something like that.

1433
01:33:23,071 --> 01:33:26,366
- You don't think that anymore?
- Oh, I... No.

1434
01:33:26,449 --> 01:33:30,704
I completely agree with that, 100%.

1435
01:33:30,787 --> 01:33:33,123
(all laughing)

1436
01:33:34,124 --> 01:33:37,460
You know, I am incredibly intimidated
to take on your role.

1437
01:33:37,544 --> 01:33:40,964
I mean, no one's going to
be able to do it like you did.

1438
01:33:41,047 --> 01:33:43,216
- I hope you don't judge me too harshly.
- Oh.

1439
01:33:43,300 --> 01:33:45,885
We all have our own way into a character.
They're all good.

1440
01:33:45,969 --> 01:33:48,972
Well, I cannot wait to do
the read-through tomorrow.

1441
01:33:49,055 --> 01:33:51,683
<i>We'll</i> work in Wilhelm's chalet.
I hope that's okay with you.

1442
01:33:51,766 --> 01:33:55,645
Yeah, sure, as long as his ghost
isn't watching over us the entire time.

1443
01:33:55,729 --> 01:33:59,149
I can't promise you that, but don't worry.
He's a well-meaning ghost.

1444
01:33:59,232 --> 01:34:02,152
Ooh. Well-meaning?
I don't know about that.

1445
01:34:02,235 --> 01:34:03,903
Nor do l.

1446
01:34:05,447 --> 01:34:09,951
You know, it's incredibly brave of you
to take on the role of Helena.

1447
01:34:10,035 --> 01:34:13,580
It's... it's a way of dealing with time.

1448
01:34:13,663 --> 01:34:16,666
Yes, well, I don't know, sometimes I...

1449
01:34:18,585 --> 01:34:21,129
I tell myself that it's just a job.

1450
01:34:21,212 --> 01:34:24,174
And I'll be happy to move on
when it's over.

1451
01:34:25,383 --> 01:34:27,677
Hey. Thank you.

1452
01:34:27,761 --> 01:34:30,847
You still want to see the snake
you asked me the other day?

1453
01:34:30,930 --> 01:34:32,265
Oh, yeah.

1454
01:34:32,349 --> 01:34:35,018
The weather they're predicting
for tomorrow seems ideal.

1455
01:34:35,101 --> 01:34:37,562
So you better make sure
you're out there at daybreak.

1456
01:34:37,645 --> 01:34:40,482
It's wonderful to see it
coming over the Maloja Pass.

1457
01:34:40,565 --> 01:34:42,359
Great. Awesome. That's amazing.

1458
01:34:42,442 --> 01:34:44,235
- Thank you.
- Okay.

1459
01:34:45,487 --> 01:34:47,572
I thought they were really nice.

1460
01:34:49,157 --> 01:34:53,661
It's true. I... She's a lot more interesting
than the person you described.

1461
01:34:54,537 --> 01:34:56,581
I didn't know her parents were musicians.

1462
01:34:56,664 --> 01:34:58,792
I liked him '[00. He's...

1463
01:34:58,875 --> 01:35:00,710
(car door opens)

1464
01:35:00,794 --> 01:35:03,755
-(laughs)
- What's so funny? Did I say something funny?

1465
01:35:05,256 --> 01:35:08,051
They spent the whole evening
flattering you.

1466
01:35:08,134 --> 01:35:09,594
Of course you liked them.

1467
01:35:09,677 --> 01:35:12,555
- That has nothing to do with it.
- No, no. Of course not.

1468
01:35:12,639 --> 01:35:14,474
(laughing)

1469
01:35:22,816 --> 01:35:25,235
-(laughing)
- What was that movie again?

1470
01:35:27,070 --> 01:35:29,906
<i>Beetle on Its Back!</i>

1471
01:35:29,989 --> 01:35:31,991
<i>What was that meme'?
Beetle on Its Back!</i>

1472
01:35:32,075 --> 01:35:34,077
(Maria laughing)

1473
01:35:35,495 --> 01:35:37,539
I can't believe we got this scoop tonight.

1474
01:35:37,622 --> 01:35:39,082
What scoop?

1475
01:35:39,165 --> 01:35:41,459
She's with Christopher Giles.

1476
01:35:41,543 --> 01:35:44,170
Chris? His name is Christopher Giles?

1477
01:35:44,254 --> 01:35:46,464
- Yes.
- Is he famous?

1478
01:35:46,548 --> 01:35:49,259
He's... fiber-famous!

1479
01:35:50,218 --> 01:35:53,388
I can't remember
which major book prize he won, but...

1480
01:35:54,848 --> 01:35:58,601
He's married. He's with Dorothea
Von Duisburg, the German artist.

1481
01:35:59,602 --> 01:36:01,896
She had a show
at the Serpentine last year.

1482
01:36:05,442 --> 01:36:07,777
Never heard of either of them.

1483
01:36:10,029 --> 01:36:12,282
You should Google him.

1484
01:36:12,365 --> 01:36:14,617
How do you spell his name?

1485
01:36:14,701 --> 01:36:17,287
Giles. G-I-L-E-S.

1486
01:36:17,370 --> 01:36:19,706
Well, he's obviously with her.

1487
01:36:21,374 --> 01:36:22,625
Yeah.

1488
01:36:22,709 --> 01:36:26,504
When word gets out,
it's going to be, like, a tsunami.

1489
01:36:28,631 --> 01:36:30,633
Well, yeah, on their planet.

1490
01:36:30,717 --> 01:36:33,011
Their planet has a name.

1491
01:36:33,094 --> 01:36:35,555
It's called the real world.
Welcome!

1492
01:36:38,057 --> 01:36:40,977
Careful with that.
Come here. Give that to me.

1493
01:36:41,060 --> 01:36:42,687
(Maria laughing loudly)

1494
01:36:42,770 --> 01:36:44,272
Here.

1495
01:36:59,996 --> 01:37:02,832
MARIA: I spent all night thinking
about Helena's death.

1496
01:37:03,833 --> 01:37:05,376
Her death?

1497
01:37:05,460 --> 01:37:09,339
She doesn't necessarily die.
She just... She disappears.

1498
01:37:09,422 --> 01:37:11,257
That's your interpretation.

1499
01:37:11,341 --> 01:37:14,511
Well, it's... it's pretty ambiguous.

1500
01:37:14,594 --> 01:37:17,013
She goes out for a hike
and never comes back.

1501
01:37:17,096 --> 01:37:19,516
Seems clear enough to me.

1502
01:37:19,599 --> 01:37:21,476
You don't know that.

1503
01:37:21,559 --> 01:37:23,603
She could reinvent herself
somewhere else.

1504
01:37:23,686 --> 01:37:25,271
There's really no way of knowing.

1505
01:37:25,355 --> 01:37:27,357
Yeah, you can imagine
whatever you want.

1506
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:29,234
Are we going the right way?

1507
01:37:29,317 --> 01:37:32,028
I mean, I don't mind waking up
at the crack of dawn,

1508
01:37:32,111 --> 01:37:34,822
but not to get lost in the mountains
and miss the snake.

1509
01:37:34,906 --> 01:37:37,242
Well, we're basically here. You happy?

1510
01:37:37,325 --> 01:37:39,869
What makes you think we're here?

1511
01:37:39,953 --> 01:37:42,455
I've got a map!
You want me to show you?

1512
01:37:42,539 --> 01:37:44,040
Come here.

1513
01:37:45,917 --> 01:37:48,962
This is the bend we just went around
10 minutes ago.

1514
01:37:49,045 --> 01:37:52,006
And just around there
is the view of the valley. You see that?

1515
01:37:52,090 --> 01:37:54,759
- How do you know?
- How do -

1516
01:37:56,469 --> 01:37:59,847
Such a fucking pain in the ass.
Jesus Christ.

1517
01:38:00,890 --> 01:38:03,768
I don't know why you're so dead set
on making this play

1518
01:38:03,851 --> 01:38:06,271
say the opposite
of what it was meant to say.

1519
01:38:06,354 --> 01:38:08,314
At 20,

1520
01:38:08,398 --> 01:38:11,067
you saw Sigrid's ambition
and you saw her violence

1521
01:38:11,150 --> 01:38:12,902
because you felt it in yourself.

1522
01:38:12,986 --> 01:38:15,572
- So?
- That's what I'm saying.

1523
01:38:15,655 --> 01:38:18,032
The text is like an object.

1524
01:38:18,116 --> 01:38:20,660
It's gonna change perspective
based on where you're standing.

1525
01:38:21,619 --> 01:38:23,121
I don't know.

1526
01:38:25,415 --> 01:38:27,584
We should go.
We're gonna miss the snake.

1527
01:38:27,667 --> 01:38:29,794
There won't be any snake.

1528
01:38:31,754 --> 01:38:33,256
Fuck it.

1529
01:39:23,765 --> 01:39:25,266
Look there!

1530
01:39:26,434 --> 01:39:28,436
Is that the snake?

1531
01:39:30,438 --> 01:39:32,815
No.

1532
01:39:32,899 --> 01:39:35,276
No, it's just mist.

1533
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:37,654
A little fog.

1534
01:39:37,737 --> 01:39:39,697
But it breaks up.

1535
01:39:42,367 --> 01:39:44,994
Still pretty beautiful though.

1536
01:39:45,078 --> 01:39:48,748
It's like it's gathering
and pouring out into the valley.

1537
01:39:50,750 --> 01:39:52,919
Maybe it is the snake.

1538
01:39:55,004 --> 01:39:57,090
We have to be patient.

1539
01:39:59,467 --> 01:40:02,303
No, it's not the snake.

1540
01:40:02,387 --> 01:40:04,347
Oh, yes!

1541
01:40:04,430 --> 01:40:07,517
I think it's turning into the snake!

1542
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:09,602
How 'bout you?

1543
01:40:10,603 --> 01:40:12,105

01:42:21,067 --> 01:42:23,820
We're having dinner.
He's a half hour late.

1559
01:42:23,903 --> 01:42:26,572
<i>Oh, so you called me to kill time.</i>

1560
01:42:26,656 --> 01:42:28,241
<i>Just kidding.</i>

1561
01:42:28,324 --> 01:42:31,702
I'm not avoiding him
I - I want to talk to him one-on-one.

1562
01:42:31,786 --> 01:42:34,413
You know how reluctant I was.
I'm over that now.

1563
01:42:34,497 --> 01:42:37,166
<i>You know, Klaus understands
the risks you're taking.</i>

1564
01:42:37,250 --> 01:42:41,087
<i>I know he's sincere. He's doing this
for you and for Wilhelm's memory.</i>

1565
01:42:41,170 --> 01:42:43,256
And for the publicity.

1566
01:42:43,339 --> 01:42:45,591
Twenty years after being Sigrid,
I'm Helena.

1567
01:42:45,675 --> 01:42:48,469
That's all the press is talking about.

1568
01:42:48,553 --> 01:42:51,305
You know, he's like every artist
of his generation.

1569
01:42:51,389 --> 01:42:53,516
He has a flair for PR.

1570
01:42:53,599 --> 01:42:55,184
<i>Oh, and is that a crime?</i>

1571
01:42:55,268 --> 01:42:59,981
To excel and to know how to show it
is to excel twice.

1572
01:43:00,064 --> 01:43:02,066
Baltasar Gracián said that.

1573
01:43:02,149 --> 01:43:06,028
<i>I have no idea who that is,
but he was right.</i>

1574
01:43:06,112 --> 01:43:08,698
<i>The press is talking about you
and your work.</i>

1575
01:43:08,781 --> 01:43:12,034
Oh, I said okay to pictures. No interviews.
It's too soon, too fragile.

1576
01:43:12,118 --> 01:43:14,120
-(phone rings)
- Hold on.

1577
01:43:15,079 --> 01:43:16,831
Yes?

1578
01:43:18,040 --> 01:43:19,959
Tell him I'm on my way down.

1579
01:43:20,042 --> 01:43:21,544
Thank you.

1580
01:43:22,962 --> 01:43:25,965
<i>- It's Klaus.
- You 'll be fine.</i>

1581
01:43:28,968 --> 01:43:30,136
Hi.

1582
01:43:31,554 --> 01:43:32,763
- Hi.
- Hi.

1583
01:43:32,847 --> 01:43:36,517
Excuse me, I'm late.
But something terrible has happened.

1584
01:43:36,601 --> 01:43:39,228
Dorothea tried to commit suicide.
She's in a coma.

1585
01:43:39,312 --> 01:43:40,771
Dorothea?

1586
01:43:40,855 --> 01:43:43,316
Christopher Giles's wife.

1587
01:43:43,399 --> 01:43:46,694
Chris. Um, Jo-Ann's friend, you mean?

1588
01:43:46,777 --> 01:43:49,655
Yes, but you are not supposed
to know he's Jo-Ann's friend.

1589
01:43:49,739 --> 01:43:51,657
Well, they were together in Sils, so...

1590
01:43:51,741 --> 01:43:55,912
I thought it was more recent than that.
Excuse me, sir. We can go.

1591
01:43:55,995 --> 01:43:59,707
Well, she slit her wrists in her studio.

1592
01:43:59,790 --> 01:44:02,793
The housekeeper found her
in a pool of her own blood.

1593
01:44:02,877 --> 01:44:04,629
Oh, that's awful.

1594
01:44:06,088 --> 01:44:07,924
She's a well-known artist, right?

1595
01:44:08,007 --> 01:44:10,092
Dorothea is an amazing girl.

1596
01:44:10,176 --> 01:44:13,387
Beautiful, talented,
everything going for her.

1597
01:44:14,305 --> 01:44:16,265
I love her work.

1598
01:44:16,349 --> 01:44:18,643
I don't understand.

1599
01:44:18,726 --> 01:44:20,353
Jo-Ann is devastated.

1600
01:44:20,436 --> 01:44:23,064
She was at an exhibition.

1601
01:44:23,147 --> 01:44:24,982
She can't go back to the hotel.

1602
01:44:25,066 --> 01:44:27,318
The paparazzi have surrounded the place.

1603
01:44:28,361 --> 01:44:31,072
I suggested she join us. You don't mind?

1604
01:44:31,155 --> 01:44:33,074
No, of course not.

1605
01:44:46,087 --> 01:44:48,506
(turn signal clicking)

1606
01:45:05,481 --> 01:45:09,318
It was still just a rumor,
but the press knew something was up.

1607
01:45:09,402 --> 01:45:12,154
Someone posted in her blog
that it was the real reason

1608
01:45:12,238 --> 01:45:14,740
that Jo-Ann had accepted
to do a play in London.

1609
01:45:14,824 --> 01:45:16,325
And is that true?

1610
01:45:16,409 --> 01:45:20,663
She doesn't need a pretext to act in London,
but the paparazzi will never let go.

1611
01:45:20,746 --> 01:45:23,958
They need a picture with Christopher.
They're going wild.

1612
01:45:26,836 --> 01:45:28,337
(phone buzzes)

1613
01:45:29,422 --> 01:45:31,882
She's in her car.
She'll be here in five minutes.

1614
01:45:35,720 --> 01:45:38,889
- You wanted to talk to me?
- Sorry. I'm confused.

1615
01:45:40,599 --> 01:45:43,102
I had a long conversation
with Rosa last night.

1616
01:45:43,185 --> 01:45:47,898
I told her you were in London,
that we were about to start rehearsals.

1617
01:45:47,982 --> 01:45:49,525
That made her happy, I think.

1618
01:45:49,608 --> 01:45:52,945
Now all we have to do
is not disappoint her.

1619
01:45:55,614 --> 01:45:58,200
- Um, let's take Chateau Larousse.
- Thank you.

1620
01:45:59,118 --> 01:46:03,205
Rosa gave me fragments
from Wilhelm's follow-up to Maloja <i>Snake.</i>

1621
01:46:03,289 --> 01:46:05,332
A sign of her trust.

1622
01:46:05,416 --> 01:46:08,210
Some of the pages
make no sense out of context,

1623
01:46:08,294 --> 01:46:11,714
but there are a few others
that put the play in a new light.

1624
01:46:12,339 --> 01:46:14,884
How old was Wilhelm
when he wrote Maloja <i>Snake?</i>

1625
01:46:14,967 --> 01:46:17,011
Thirty-five or so? How -

1626
01:46:17,094 --> 01:46:18,554
Hmm. Thirty-eight.

1627
01:46:18,637 --> 01:46:20,139
- Thirty-eight?
- Yeah.

1628
01:46:20,222 --> 01:46:24,351
- Little older when he made the film.
- He was still a young man. All action.

1629
01:46:25,352 --> 01:46:28,064
Twenty-five years later,
obviously he was more analytical,

1630
01:46:28,147 --> 01:46:31,525
trying to put things in perspective,
maybe thinking about posterity.

1631
01:46:31,609 --> 01:46:33,569
Who knows?

1632
01:46:33,652 --> 01:46:36,697
Isn't it better to stay faithful
to his youthful energy?

1633
01:46:36,781 --> 01:46:38,491
- And forget the new scenes?
- Yes.

1634
01:46:41,160 --> 01:46:43,537
Wilhelm never had
any distance or maturity.

1635
01:46:43,621 --> 01:46:49,293
On the contrary, his last texts got bolder
and bolder and more and more enigmatic.

1636
01:46:50,795 --> 01:46:53,422
Here's another way of looking at it.

1637
01:46:53,506 --> 01:46:55,299
We think like him.

1638
01:46:55,382 --> 01:46:58,302
We - We project ourselves
into the future

1639
01:46:58,385 --> 01:47:01,680
instead of freezing ourselves
in the past so that we -

1640
01:47:01,764 --> 01:47:03,808
- Jo-Ann.
- Hi.

1641
01:47:04,642 --> 01:47:07,436
- What's happening?
- She's hanging on by a thread.

1642
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:10,773
She's lost a lot of blood,
but the doctors won't tell us anything.

1643
01:47:10,856 --> 01:47:13,692
I mean, Chris said she was
really relaxed when he told her.

1644
01:47:13,776 --> 01:47:15,945
She was just getting used to
the new situation.

1645
01:47:16,028 --> 01:47:17,488
Where's Christopher?

1646
01:47:17,571 --> 01:47:19,824
Dorothea's family got home
from Germany, so he...

1647
01:47:19,907 --> 01:47:23,119
They told him to leave the hospital,
so he's going to come join us.

1648
01:47:23,202 --> 01:47:24,954
Here? But that's ridiculous.

1649
01:47:25,037 --> 01:47:27,957
He will have all the paparazzi
from the hospital on his trail.

1650
01:47:28,040 --> 01:47:30,459
No. He said there were no paparazzi.
He'd know.

1651
01:47:30,543 --> 01:47:32,795
He's being naive.
Of course they're tailing him.

1652
01:47:32,878 --> 01:47:37,049
They're just doing it discreetly.
Tell him absolutely not to join us.

1653
01:47:42,471 --> 01:47:45,724
His - His voice mail's turned off.
<i>I'll</i> just text him.

1654
01:47:46,767 --> 01:47:48,811
If they follow him here, we are stuck.

1655
01:47:49,770 --> 01:47:52,565
- Do you have your driver?
- Yeah. He's outside.

1656
01:47:53,566 --> 01:47:56,026
Okay. Tell Christopher
to meet us at my club.

1657
01:47:56,110 --> 01:47:58,445
At least we'll have
some peace and quiet.

1658
01:47:58,529 --> 01:48:00,156
- Here's the address.
- Chris!

1659
01:48:00,239 --> 01:48:02,074
Hey, hey-

1660
01:48:02,158 --> 01:48:03,993
Are you all right?

1661
01:48:04,076 --> 01:48:06,662
- Did you get my messages?
- Um -

1662
01:48:06,745 --> 01:48:10,583
Klaus thinks the paparazzi
are following you from the hospital.

1663
01:48:10,666 --> 01:48:13,043
I don't know. I... I didn't see any.

1664
01:48:13,127 --> 01:48:16,297
They can't get a picture of us tonight.
It'd be a total disaster.

1665
01:48:16,380 --> 01:48:19,466
It'd spread like wildfire.
I'm going to call my driver.

1666
01:48:21,719 --> 01:48:24,013
Hey. Will you come pick us up?

1667
01:48:24,096 --> 01:48:26,515
- All right.
- Here.

1668
01:48:26,599 --> 01:48:28,517
The address of my club.

1669
01:48:28,601 --> 01:48:31,562
<i>We'll</i> go first.
Wait five minutes, take a taxi and join us.

1670
01:48:44,700 --> 01:48:46,619
(engine starts)

1671
01:48:47,953 --> 01:48:49,455
(tires screech)

1672
01:48:59,256 --> 01:49:01,383
- Fuck, they're following us.
-(phone chiming)

1673
01:49:02,927 --> 01:49:04,386
Hey, Ari?

1674
01:49:04,470 --> 01:49:06,805
No, there's no news here
from the hospital.

1675
01:49:06,889 --> 01:49:10,059
Yeah, I could really use you right now.

1676
01:49:10,142 --> 01:49:11,894
Whatever the first plane out is.

1677
01:49:11,977 --> 01:49:15,189
I'm stuck here in London
till the end of the year.

1678
01:49:15,272 --> 01:49:17,358
Rehearsals start tomorrow.

1679
01:49:17,441 --> 01:49:19,526
If she doesn't make it,

1680
01:49:19,610 --> 01:49:22,571
it's going to be a nuclear fucking winter.

1681
01:49:22,655 --> 01:49:24,907
KLAUS: What do you want to do?
Change hotels?

1682
01:49:25,658 --> 01:49:29,495
No way. Wherever I go, they're just
gonna find me and chase me down.

1683
01:49:29,578 --> 01:49:31,497
I'd rather just stay where I am.

1684
01:49:31,580 --> 01:49:34,083
You know, it's... I'm fine with it.

1685
01:49:34,166 --> 01:49:36,168
It'll just be hard for Chris.

1686
01:49:36,252 --> 01:49:38,671
- The media is going to crucify him.
- No,no.

1687
01:49:38,754 --> 01:49:42,174
I'll take the heat.
I'll be the home wrecker.

1688
01:49:42,258 --> 01:49:45,594
I'm used to getting nasty shit written about me.
I could honestly care less.

1689
01:49:45,678 --> 01:49:49,098
You want us to cancel tomorrow's rehearsal?
Maria, would you mind?

1690
01:49:49,181 --> 01:49:51,725
- No, of course not, no.
- No way.

1691
01:49:51,809 --> 01:49:54,603
No, no, no. I'd rather work.

1692
01:49:59,525 --> 01:50:02,278
- We didn't get to talk much.
- No.

1693
01:50:02,361 --> 01:50:05,572
<i>I'll</i> have the new scenes dropped off
at the front desk.

1694
01:50:05,656 --> 01:50:07,783
And we'll talk about them seriously.

1695
01:50:07,866 --> 01:50:10,786
Yeah, we can do that tomorrow,
after rehearsal.

1696
01:50:10,869 --> 01:50:14,623
Mmm, I'm drained after a workday.
It's not the best time for me.

1697
01:50:14,707 --> 01:50:17,084
I know. Same for me.

1698
01:50:17,167 --> 01:50:21,297
And next weekend I have to
see my kids in southern Italy.

1699
01:50:22,715 --> 01:50:25,467
<i>We'll</i> manage. Okay, good night.

1700
01:50:25,551 --> 01:50:27,011
Good night.

1701
01:50:27,094 --> 01:50:29,638
(door opens, closes)

1702
01:50:36,562 --> 01:50:39,606
“When they tell me about you,
how much they appreciate you,

1703
01:50:39,690 --> 01:50:42,443
it's to remind me how happy they are

1704
01:50:42,526 --> 01:50:45,112
to grant you what they never granted me.

1705
01:50:46,113 --> 01:50:48,115
- They're using you -”
-(knocking)

1706
01:51:00,085 --> 01:51:02,129
- Hi.
- I printed everything out.

1707
01:51:02,212 --> 01:51:03,172
Thanks.

1708
01:51:03,255 --> 01:51:06,592
If you want an English solicitor
to take a look at the papers, tell me.

1709
01:51:06,675 --> 01:51:09,470
I know a bilingual girl
who specializes in Paris real estates.

1710
01:51:11,597 --> 01:51:13,015
That's the sales agreements.

1711
01:51:13,098 --> 01:51:16,685
Your ex-husband is buying your half
of the apartment for the price you agreed to.

1712
01:51:16,769 --> 01:51:19,772
No, I didn't want to discuss it.
Maybe I was wrong.

1713
01:51:20,522 --> 01:51:23,400
That's the sales agreement
for the studio on rue du Chemin Vert.

1714
01:51:23,484 --> 01:51:26,695
Yeah. it's expensive, but it's worth it.

1715
01:51:26,779 --> 01:51:29,114
- So it's ready to sign?
- Tomorrow, as planned.

1716
01:51:29,198 --> 01:51:32,409
You take the Eurostar at 8:15,
leave Paris at 5:00,

1717
01:51:32,493 --> 01:51:35,037
and you'll be back in London
in time for dinner.

1718
01:51:35,120 --> 01:51:37,206
- Okay.
- If you want, I can travel with you.

1719
01:51:37,289 --> 01:51:38,957
<i>No, I'm fine.</i>

1720
01:51:43,003 --> 01:51:44,963
WOMAN: What do I tell Piers Roaldson?

1721
01:51:45,047 --> 01:51:47,216
Remind me who he is.

1722
01:51:47,299 --> 01:51:51,804
He's shooting a film next summer
called <i>Electric Shockwave.</i>

1723
01:51:51,887 --> 01:51:53,514
What's he done?

1724
01:51:53,597 --> 01:51:55,307
Nothing. He's 25.

1725
01:51:55,391 --> 01:51:58,769
But Jay says it's good
and that it's been green-lit.

1726
01:51:58,852 --> 01:52:02,439
- What's the part?
- They haven't sent it over yet.

1727
01:52:02,523 --> 01:52:04,024
It's the lead.

1728
01:52:04,108 --> 01:52:07,319
I think your character would be
some sort of... hybrid.

1729
01:52:08,821 --> 01:52:12,074
Mm, a creation of modern genetics,
but with a soul.

1730
01:52:12,157 --> 01:52:15,327
It's set in the near future,
the 23rd century.

1731
01:52:15,411 --> 01:52:17,413
On Earth?

1732
01:52:17,496 --> 01:52:19,832
Maybe. I'm not sure.

Thank you.

1736
01:52:27,673 --> 01:52:30,884
Well, tell Piers I'm interested,
and I'll read the script next week.

1737
01:52:30,968 --> 01:52:32,636
Okay?

1738
01:52:32,719 --> 01:52:35,139
And, uh, there are the new scenes
Klaus sent you.

1739
01:52:35,222 --> 01:52:37,558
- Ah, yes, I forgot.
- You want to run the lines?

1740
01:52:38,559 --> 01:52:40,978
No. I haven't read the pages yet.

1741
01:52:41,061 --> 01:52:42,813
He wants to know what you think.

1742
01:52:42,896 --> 01:52:45,107
Why doesn't he just call me?

1743
01:52:45,190 --> 01:52:47,359
Maybe he's waiting for your reaction.

1744
01:52:47,443 --> 01:52:49,653
You've had the scenes for two weeks.

1745
01:52:49,736 --> 01:52:51,697
I understand.

1746
01:52:51,780 --> 01:52:54,658
But I'd rather discover them
at the last minute and not overthink it.

1747
01:52:54,741 --> 01:52:58,454
It's the only way
I can keep it spontaneous.

1748
01:52:58,537 --> 01:53:01,540
That's how I, um, prepared Sigrid
20 years ago.

1749
01:53:01,623 --> 01:53:03,709
I'll do the same thing with Helena.

1750
01:53:04,751 --> 01:53:08,255

I think they're very good.

- Okay.

There are plenty.

Uh, may I have a cup of coffee, please?

1763
01:54:37,844 --> 01:54:40,138
You can imagine my first question.

1764
01:54:40,222 --> 01:54:45,185
Will the media frenzy around Jo-Ann Ellis
steal the spotlight?

1765
01:54:45,269 --> 01:54:48,355
All that matters is the show.
The rest is of no importance.

1766
01:54:48,438 --> 01:54:51,567
And fortunately, Dorothea pulled through.

1767
01:54:51,650 --> 01:54:55,404
I know you have a new take on it,
but will the audience be receptive

1768
01:54:55,487 --> 01:54:57,406
or might they be too distracted?

1769
01:54:57,489 --> 01:54:59,324
I suppose that's my question.

1770
01:54:59,408 --> 01:55:01,285
I hope they'll be receptive.

1771
01:55:01,368 --> 01:55:03,412
So you think the shows are airtight?

1772
01:55:03,495 --> 01:55:06,331
No connection to the outside world.

1773
01:55:06,415 --> 01:55:07,708
No.

1774
01:55:07,791 --> 01:55:10,794
No, each theatergoer
brings his own subjectivity.

1775
01:55:10,877 --> 01:55:14,339
And it's generally not defined
by tabloid headlines.

1776
01:55:14,423 --> 01:55:16,508
Some will go for the smell of scandal.

1777
01:55:16,592 --> 01:55:19,970
So will they see the show you had in mind,
or something else?

1778
01:55:22,472 --> 01:55:24,600
- MARIA: Jo-Ann?
- What's up?

1779
01:55:24,683 --> 01:55:26,476
I wanted to ask you -

1780
01:55:26,560 --> 01:55:29,313
You know the scene
at the beginning of act 3

1781
01:55:29,396 --> 01:55:33,609
when you tell me you want to leave
and I get on my knees and beg you to stay?

1782
01:55:33,692 --> 01:55:37,404
You're on the phone ordering pepperoncino
pizza for your coworkers in Accounting.

1783
01:55:37,487 --> 01:55:40,699
Well, you... you leave
without looking at me,

1784
01:55:40,782 --> 01:55:43,452
as if I didn't exist.

1785
01:55:43,535 --> 01:55:45,621
Um...

1786
01:55:45,704 --> 01:55:47,914
if you could pause for a second,
you know,

1787
01:55:47,998 --> 01:55:52,836
Helena's distress would last longer
when she's left alone in her office.

1788
01:55:54,087 --> 01:55:56,965
Well, the way you're playing it, um,

1789
01:55:57,049 --> 01:56:00,636
the audience follows you out,
but instantly forgets about her, so...

1790
01:56:01,470 --> 01:56:04,806
So... So what?

1791
01:56:04,890 --> 01:56:08,268
Well, when I played Sigrid,
I... I held it longer.

1792
01:56:08,352 --> 01:56:11,563
I thought it was more powerful,
dramatically.

1793
01:56:11,647 --> 01:56:13,523
I mean, it really played well.

1794
01:56:13,607 --> 01:56:17,319
Well, no one really gives a fuck
about Helena at that point, do they?

1795
01:56:17,402 --> 01:56:21,198
I'm sorry, but I mean, it's pretty clear to me
this poor woman's all washed up.

1796
01:56:21,281 --> 01:56:23,825
I mean, your character, right? Not you.

1797
01:56:23,909 --> 01:56:27,829
And... when Sigrid leaves Helena's office,

1798
01:56:27,913 --> 01:56:29,998
Helena is a wreck, and we get it.

1799
01:56:30,082 --> 01:56:32,334
You know, it's time to move on.

1800
01:56:32,417 --> 01:56:34,711
I think they want what comes next.

1801
01:56:35,504 --> 01:56:38,423
If you just held it a few seconds longer.

1802
01:56:38,507 --> 01:56:41,510
It doesn't really feel right for me, Maria.

1803
01:56:41,593 --> 01:56:43,095

1804
01:56:44,012 --> 01:56:45,597
You're right.

1805
01:56:46,682 --> 01:56:48,642
Yeah.

1806
01:56:48,725 --> 01:56:50,227
I, um...

1807
01:56:51,603 --> 01:56:55,107
I think I'm lost in my memories.

1808
01:56:55,190 --> 01:56:57,651
You think you've forgotten
your old habits,

1809
01:56:57,734 --> 01:56:59,528
but they all - they all come back.

1810
01:56:59,611 --> 01:57:01,905
I have to break them.

1811
01:57:01,988 --> 01:57:04,449
I guess you do.

1812
01:57:18,797 --> 01:57:21,466

1816
01:57:32,352 --> 01:57:35,480
Thanks so much for seeing me tonight.
I really appreciate it.

1817
01:57:35,564 --> 01:57:38,942
We're leaving early tomorrow morning
for a location scout in the Ukraine.

1818

be shooting our exteriors, mostly.

1819
01:57:41,903 --> 01:57:44,156
So, I - I read your script.

1820
01:57:44,239 --> 01:57:48,410
Yeah, well, um, I know we've never met,
but I actually wrote it with you in mind.

1821
01:57:48,493 --> 01:57:50,620
(sighs)
As a mutant?

1822
01:57:50,704 --> 01:57:54,666
I'm trying to consider genetics
from a more human point of view.

1823
01:57:56,126 --> 01:58:00,547
When I was reading it, um,
I imagined someone much younger.

1824
01:58:00,630 --> 01:58:02,799
Maybe me younger, actually,

1825
01:58:02,883 --> 01:58:06,094
but you're seeing me in movies
that were made years ago.

1826
01:58:06,178 --> 01:58:07,679
I've changed.

1827
01:58:07,763 --> 01:58:09,681
She has no age.

1828
01:58:09,765 --> 01:58:13,769
Or else she's every age at once,
like all of us.

1829
01:58:14,978 --> 01:58:16,855
Can I be frank?

1830
01:58:18,356 --> 01:58:21,985
Maybe it's because I'm working with her,
but... as I was reading it,

1831
01:58:22,068 --> 01:58:25,113
I kept thinking about Jo-Ann.

1832
01:58:25,197 --> 01:58:28,200
Yeah, well, personally,

1833
01:58:28,283 --> 01:58:30,952
I never think about Jo-Ann Ellis.

1834
01:58:31,036 --> 01:58:34,331
You're wrong.
She's smart... and talented.

1835
01:58:34,414 --> 01:58:37,042
She's modern, just like your character.

1836
01:58:37,125 --> 01:58:40,462
My character isn't modern.
Not in that way, anyway.

1837
01:58:40,545 --> 01:58:43,006
She's... outside of time.

1838
01:58:43,089 --> 01:58:45,050
Outside of time.

1839
01:58:48,261 --> 01:58:50,972
I don't understand.
It's too abstract for me.

1840
01:58:51,056 --> 01:58:52,516
(chuckling)
Sorry.

1841
01:58:52,599 --> 01:58:55,644
I, uh - I don't like this era.

1842
01:58:55,727 --> 01:58:57,395
You're wrong. it's yours.

1843
01:58:57,479 --> 01:58:59,231
Hey, man, I didn't choose it.

1844
01:59:00,398 --> 01:59:03,860
And if my era is Jo-Ann Ellis
and viral Internet scandals,

1845
01:59:03,944 --> 01:59:06,571
I think I'm entitled
to feel unrelated, aren't I?

1846
01:59:07,989 --> 01:59:11,576
I mean, it's nothing against her.
I guessed I just assumed you'd understand.
