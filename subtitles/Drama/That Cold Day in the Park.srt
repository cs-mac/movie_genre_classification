1
00:02:22,185 --> 00:02:24,687
(Doorbell rings)

2
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:27,315
(Door rattles)

3
00:02:43,873 --> 00:02:46,834
- Is it any warmer?
- No, it's really cold.

4
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,713
You'd better take those to Mrs Parnell.
It look me longer than I thought.

5
00:02:53,633 --> 00:02:55,635
Here are the birds.

6
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,305
Darn. They should have been in
ten minutes ago.

7
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:29,419
- The avocados were too hard.
- I've made some soup anyway.

8
00:03:29,544 --> 00:03:31,963
The doctor always enjoys a bit of soup.

9
00:03:32,088 --> 00:03:34,173
I don't believe
Mrs Ebury's mother's coming,

10
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:36,634
but would you leave the extra bird in
just in case?

11
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:40,346
Or you could have some cold
tomorrow with a nice jacket potato.

12
00:03:40,471 --> 00:03:42,932
You know I don't like potatoes.

13
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:03,619
(Doorbell rings)

14
00:04:03,745 --> 00:04:05,788
(Door opens)

15
00:04:07,457 --> 00:04:09,542
- Dr Stevenson.
- Parnell.

16
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:13,254
(Woman) We'll never get a cab
and it'll be pouring in an hour.

17
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:16,841
Oh, Mother.
You'd better leave your coat on, Mother.

18
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:18,968
I can't eat with my coat on, can I?

19
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:20,553
You should have worn
something warmer.

20
00:04:20,678 --> 00:04:22,346
I have something warmer underneath.

21
00:04:22,472 --> 00:04:24,640
Your hair's lovely.
Did you do something different?

22
00:04:24,766 --> 00:04:26,851
Yes, well, I went to a new shop
in the Bower Building.

23
00:04:26,976 --> 00:04:28,186
I like the blue in it.

24
00:04:28,311 --> 00:04:31,564
It's getting nasty again. I wager
we'll have snow before the week is up.

25
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:33,399
- Well, help yourself.
- Thank you, dear.

26
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:36,277
Frances. You look happy.

27
00:04:39,405 --> 00:04:42,158
Well, Doctor, how goes it
with the bedpan set?

28
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:44,160
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

29
00:04:44,285 --> 00:04:46,454
- We've missed you on the green.
- I'll be back soon enough.

30
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:49,707
- It's caught up on my bracelet.
- Let me help you, Mother.

31
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:52,627
(Whispers) Excuse me.

32
00:04:55,713 --> 00:04:59,425
- How did you come up?
- We took the lift.

33
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,428
I had to walk. There was
an out-of-service sign on the elevator.

34
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:03,971
It brought us up all right.

35
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:05,097
- David never reads signs.
- David.

36
00:05:05,223 --> 00:05:07,517
...never economy. And mark my words...

37
00:05:07,642 --> 00:05:11,521
- David, no more politics.
- How are the dogs doing?

38
00:05:11,646 --> 00:05:15,233
- (Guests chatter)
- I'll get the crystal.

39
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,737
(Guests chatter)

40
00:05:23,366 --> 00:05:25,785
(David) And in all fairness
to the parties concerned...

41
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,703
David.

42
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:30,414
- (Laughter)
- Oh, the squabs.

43
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:33,960
(Woman) They must be frozen.
Are they frozen, Frances?

44
00:05:34,085 --> 00:05:36,295
It's not squab. It's Cornish game meat.

45
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,131
- Cornish game birds. I love them.
- Yes, they're very good.

46
00:05:40,675 --> 00:05:43,177
And when you come to me, Frances,

47
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:47,265
I'll have some of that fatty skin that's
fixed to the bottom of the platter.

48
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:51,185
This wine's delicious, Frances.

49
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:55,022
It sounds very interesting. I'll tell you
one thing that's always puzzled me.

50
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:57,483
- Why is <i>it...</i>
- Oh, Mother.

51
00:05:57,608 --> 00:05:59,610
I did taste it. It was delicious.

52
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:02,154
- It tastes sour.
- Well, then, don't have it.

53
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,241
Thank you. I'll take some
from the other side, dear.

54
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:08,327
(Female guest) Oh, God, yes.

55
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:10,913
(Guests chatter)

56
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:15,251
(Woman) David, please. David.

57
00:06:19,297 --> 00:06:21,966
(Man sneezes)

58
00:06:22,091 --> 00:06:24,510
- (Sneezes)
- (Woman) Can't you control yourself?

59
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:27,597
Calm down. You're getting it
all over the carpet.

60
00:06:27,722 --> 00:06:30,266
- (Coughs)
- Parnell, take the cup. What a mess.

61
00:06:30,391 --> 00:06:32,268
(Woman no. 2) Can't you stop it?

62
00:06:32,393 --> 00:06:34,478
(David) It must be something in the room.

63
00:06:34,604 --> 00:06:36,272
(Woman) He's allergic to pollen.

64
00:06:36,397 --> 00:06:38,357
(Man) But there isn't any,
at this time of the year.

65
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:39,692
It's starting to rain.

66
00:06:39,817 --> 00:06:42,528
(Man) Yes, I suppose it is. It's been doing
it on and off for two months.

67
00:06:42,653 --> 00:06:45,281
(Woman)
Well, could he be allergic to rain?

68
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:49,327
I read somewhere that people
catch colds from germs,

69
00:06:49,452 --> 00:06:51,245
not from getting wet and being cold.

70
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:54,916
Rubbish. I always catch cold
after I've been wet or had a chill.

71
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:58,544
- What about it, Doctor?
- Well, actually, Frances is correct.

72
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:00,463
(Frances) There's a boy
sitting out there in the rain.

73
00:07:00,588 --> 00:07:02,965
(David) He's a damn fool.
He'll be sneezing next.

74
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,926
(Doctor)
It's not as simple as all that, though.

75
00:07:05,051 --> 00:07:06,761
Moisture has a great deal to do with it.

76
00:07:06,886 --> 00:07:08,971
The amount of moisture
one takes into one's lungs.

77
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:12,683
- (Frances) Someone should ask him in.
- Frances, what a curious thing to say.

78
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:15,269
I'm glad your mother's not alive
to hear a remark like that.

79
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:16,520
He doesn't even have a coat.

80
00:07:16,646 --> 00:07:20,441
Well, nobody's forcing him to sit
out in the rain. Perhaps he likes it.

81
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:23,402
He's just a boy.
Perhaps he has nowhere to go.

82
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:26,822
(Woman) You're being sentimental. One
would think you'd never read the papers.

83
00:07:26,948 --> 00:07:28,783
Come on, David. We must go.

84
00:07:28,908 --> 00:07:31,410
You'll want to nap
before you go off to bridge club.

85
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:34,038
- Shall I call you a cab, Mr Ebury?
- Yes, perhaps you'd better.

86
00:07:34,163 --> 00:07:35,748
Perhaps the doctor could drop us.

87
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:38,042
I'm not leaving for a few minutes.
I want a word with Frances.

88
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:41,504
Please. They're going to have such
trouble getting a taxi in all this rain,

89
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:43,089
and we can always talk another time.

90
00:07:43,214 --> 00:07:44,590
I particularly wanted to speak to you.

91
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:48,094
Well, aren't we going to see each other
Friday afternoon?

92
00:07:48,219 --> 00:07:50,763
- We're bowling, aren't we?
- Not if this weather holds.

93
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:53,599
(Woman)
We're right on the way to your office.

94
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:55,685
Please.

95
00:07:56,811 --> 00:07:58,938
Right.

96
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:03,275
(Rain pours outside)

97
00:08:03,401 --> 00:08:06,612
- I don't think Frances looks well.
- I hardly noticed.

98
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:08,572
(David) Oh, she's always looking tired.

99
00:08:08,698 --> 00:08:11,367
(Woman no. 2) She should take royal jelly,
one capsule every morning.

100
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:12,618
(David) What on earth's that?

101
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:14,787
(Woman no. 2)
What the queen bees make.

102
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:16,747
Which is what they eat.

103
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:19,291
(Door opens and shuts)

104
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:24,547
(Man) We're on our way.

105
00:08:24,672 --> 00:08:26,424
I put the bowls out for soup.

106
00:08:26,549 --> 00:08:29,010
- Don't forget to turn it off.
- I won't.

107
00:08:38,394 --> 00:08:40,312
(Door shuts)

108
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:45,860
(Frances) Hello!

109
00:08:45,985 --> 00:08:48,571
I'm talk...I'm talking to you!

110
00:08:49,572 --> 00:08:52,074
Come over here!

111
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:54,243
Yes! YOU

112
00:08:56,037 --> 00:08:58,080
(Bird squawks)

113
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,335
(Foghorn sounds)

114
00:09:08,591 --> 00:09:10,801
I saw you from my apartment.

115
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:13,345
I've been watching you in the rain.

116
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:18,559
Would you like to come upstairs to
my place, to my apartment, and get dry,

117
00:09:18,684 --> 00:09:21,312
just until the rain stops?

118
00:09:21,437 --> 00:09:25,816
I'll meet you right at the end down here
and we can go up to my apartment.

119
00:09:25,941 --> 00:09:29,236
The rain should let up shortly
and I can dry your things.

120
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:31,906
It's right this way. Just follow me.

121
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:36,994
(Bells chime)

122
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:42,875
(Vehicle sounds horn)

123
00:09:55,346 --> 00:09:57,431
Are you a student?

124
00:10:00,893 --> 00:10:03,020
Do you go to school?

125
00:10:04,897 --> 00:10:06,857
Are you a student?

126
00:10:09,485 --> 00:10:11,487
Can you hear me?

127
00:10:13,823 --> 00:10:16,408
You understand what I'm saying?

128
00:10:23,124 --> 00:10:25,084
Let me take your shoes off. Here.

129
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:28,212
Muddy.

130
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:41,559
Would you like a bath?

131
00:10:41,684 --> 00:10:43,519
A hot bath? You want a hot...

132
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:45,688
Come with me.

133
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:02,830
(Water runs)

134
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:07,293
Come and stand over here.

135
00:11:07,418 --> 00:11:08,502
Here.

136
00:11:18,012 --> 00:11:20,222
Come, let's take off your shirt.

137
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:40,117
Sit down.

138
00:12:30,084 --> 00:12:32,044
(Clock ticks)

139
00:12:53,816 --> 00:12:57,736
Would you like me to fix you
something else?

140
00:12:57,861 --> 00:13:00,572
Are you still hungry?

141
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:03,575
I know.

142
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:14,169
Oh.

143
00:13:15,296 --> 00:13:20,718
Well, it really looked quite nice before
Mrs Parnell transferred it to this plate.

144
00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:23,679
She has a thing about taking leftovers

145
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:25,431
and putting them
from one plate to another

146
00:13:25,556 --> 00:13:28,058
so she can wash up the first one.

147
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,197
I made it myself.

148
00:13:42,323 --> 00:13:44,283
I made it yesterday.

149
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:55,169
There's, er...pineapple and cream
and sponge cake.

150
00:13:57,755 --> 00:13:59,965
It's really quite good.

151
00:14:05,971 --> 00:14:07,431
Oh.

152
00:14:07,556 --> 00:14:09,558
I'm sorry.

153
00:14:11,352 --> 00:14:13,562
I wish I knew your name.

154
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:14,772
Your name.

155
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:21,320
Er...

156
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:23,530
I'm Frances.

157
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:25,783
Frances Austen.

158
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:35,793
You must think that
I'm a compulsive talker.

159
00:14:35,918 --> 00:14:40,464
But it just seems so odd to sit here in
silence, with you not saying anything.

160
00:14:53,185 --> 00:14:55,813
(Organ plays out of tune)

161
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:04,279
(Organ plays out of tune)

162
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:30,305
(Playing stops)

163
00:15:30,431 --> 00:15:33,350
<i>Do you DWI?</i>

164
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:35,727
Are you fond of music?

165
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:38,897
I have a...a small record collection.

166
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:41,608
Perhaps you would
like to hear something?

167
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:47,531
Would you come...come with me?

168
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,452
Would you come with me?

169
00:15:55,581 --> 00:15:57,666
My mother had
a large collection of records

170
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:00,085
but most of them are stored
in the spare room.

171
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:03,255
I keep my collection here.
Perhaps there's one you'll like in it.

172
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:07,217
Oh, there is one in particular
that I think you might like.

173
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:12,347
I took a course in music appreciation,
at one time,

174
00:16:12,473 --> 00:16:15,726
and now I try to spend
half an hour to an hour every day

175
00:16:15,851 --> 00:16:18,312
listening to something I really like.

176
00:16:23,859 --> 00:16:26,403
(Music plays)

177
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:38,040
(Music plays)

178
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:52,429
(Music stops)

179
00:17:00,646 --> 00:17:03,315
Do you want me to play this?

180
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,944
Do you want me to put that
on the record player?

181
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:19,206
(Music plays)

182
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:28,006
(Music plays)

183
00:17:45,941 --> 00:17:47,943
(Music plays)

184
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:06,396
(Music stops)

185
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:13,320
(Music plays)

186
00:19:23,789 --> 00:19:25,791
(Phone rings)

187
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:30,671
(Music stops)

188
00:19:32,714 --> 00:19:35,384
(Frances) Hello? Hello, Uncle David.

189
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:37,636
Did you?

190
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:42,307
Well, what kind of an envelope was it?

191
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:45,435
Yes, all right.
Well, hold on and I'll have a look.

192
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,979
I'm trying to remember.
Where did you sit?

193
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:52,067
Yes, perhaps it slipped
down the side of the sofa.

194
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:54,486
Hold on. Yes, just a moment.

195
00:19:58,532 --> 00:20:00,575
(Rain falling outside)

196
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:14,423
No, I don't see it.

197
00:20:15,507 --> 00:20:18,343
Yes, well, certainly.
I'll have a long look tomorrow, then.

198
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:21,012
Yes, tomorrow. Goodnight.

199
00:20:21,138 --> 00:20:23,140
(Rain falling outside)

200
00:20:29,521 --> 00:20:31,565
(Rain falling outside)

201
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,275
Are you really asleep?

202
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,819
(Rain falling outside)

203
00:21:06,516 --> 00:21:08,518
(Rain falling outside)

204
00:21:34,586 --> 00:21:38,757
I've made up a bed for you
in the spare room.

205
00:21:38,882 --> 00:21:41,176
You can stay if you like.

206
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:43,303
If you want to.

207
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:47,933
I don't know if you have a home or not.
I expect you have a room somewhere.

208
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:52,354
You don't have to, now. It's only an idea.

209
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:55,106
But your things won't be dry till morning.

210
00:21:55,232 --> 00:21:57,192
(Rain falling outside)

211
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,198
But it is warm here and there is a bed.

212
00:22:04,616 --> 00:22:06,326
Besides...

213
00:22:07,702 --> 00:22:10,247
...it's still raining out.

214
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:54,749
Goodnight.

215
00:22:59,337 --> 00:23:01,131
(Door shuts)

216
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,799
(Door rattles)

217
00:25:45,336 --> 00:25:47,297
Morning.

218
00:25:47,422 --> 00:25:51,468
I thought you might be tired of eggs
so I've made you something different.

219
00:25:51,593 --> 00:25:53,595
There.

220
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:57,057
Oh, I'm sorry.

221
00:25:57,182 --> 00:25:59,684
Er...

222
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:04,439
I've made you coffee. But if you'd
prefer tea, it's simple enough to do.

223
00:26:04,564 --> 00:26:06,733
I have to go out and do some shopping.

224
00:26:06,858 --> 00:26:09,611
I have to get some things,
but you know where the bathroom is

225
00:26:09,736 --> 00:26:14,199
and if you're still hungry, you can go
out and make yourself something else.

226
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,119
L...l shouldn't be longer than an hour.

227
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:41,684
(Clicks)

228
00:26:57,617 --> 00:26:59,619
(Toilet flushes)

229
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:07,836
(Clock ticks)

230
00:27:21,057 --> 00:27:23,017
(Clock ticks)

231
00:28:22,452 --> 00:28:24,537
(Footsteps)

232
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,830
Oh!

233
00:29:08,957 --> 00:29:11,125
Come see what I bought for you.

234
00:29:11,251 --> 00:29:13,670
You found Parnell's jacket, did you?

235
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:17,423
They're for you.

236
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,511
Try them on. Try the trousers on.

237
00:29:26,224 --> 00:29:28,184
They're very fashionable,
don't you think?

238
00:29:28,309 --> 00:29:30,478
I got them at the young men's shop.

239
00:29:54,043 --> 00:29:56,921
Oh, that's very nice.

240
00:29:57,046 --> 00:29:58,339
It's difficult to buy for somebody,

241
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:00,633
when you don't even know
what colour they like.

242
00:30:02,051 --> 00:30:03,511
The shoes?

243
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:07,140
I would have gotten leather,

244
00:30:07,265 --> 00:30:10,226
but the man says it's difficult
unless you have the person there to fit...

245
00:30:10,351 --> 00:30:12,437
Oh! There's the socks.

246
00:30:14,647 --> 00:30:16,566
Perhaps, er...

247
00:30:17,734 --> 00:30:20,153
...you don't wear socks
with those kind of shoes...

248
00:30:22,739 --> 00:30:24,824
Up. UP-

249
00:30:24,949 --> 00:30:27,744
Let me see. Oh, it's very nice.

250
00:30:28,745 --> 00:30:30,913
The colours are very nice.

251
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:35,543
These are presents from me to you,

252
00:30:35,668 --> 00:30:39,088
and you're welcome to take them
with you when you go.

253
00:30:44,761 --> 00:30:46,971
I'll go fix some lunch.

254
00:30:51,768 --> 00:30:54,312
(Cutlery clinks)

255
00:30:54,437 --> 00:30:57,231
(Frances)
I hope you like your chicken cold.

256
00:30:57,357 --> 00:30:59,859
Usually, l...l like to prepare it myself,

257
00:30:59,984 --> 00:31:04,155
but I didn't have time today,
what with the shopping and all.

258
00:31:05,823 --> 00:31:07,241
I wish you could speak.

259
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:12,372
It's so difficult to know what you want
or what you're thinking sometimes.

260
00:31:12,497 --> 00:31:15,416
You know, I have this friend.
He's a doctor.

261
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:19,045
His name is Charles
and he does some psychotherapy.

262
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:24,550
He actually made this woman, who
was convinced that she couldn't walk,

263
00:31:24,675 --> 00:31:26,552
ride a bicycle.

264
00:31:26,677 --> 00:31:29,555
I remember, one morning,

265
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,892
er...my girlfriend
and I, my best girlfriend,

266
00:31:33,017 --> 00:31:35,937
we decided that we would play truant.

267
00:31:36,062 --> 00:31:40,274
So, we rode our bicycles right up
to the front gates of the school

268
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,402
and then we turned
and went the other way

269
00:31:42,527 --> 00:31:44,779
and we cycled and cycled
and cycled for miles,

270
00:31:44,904 --> 00:31:49,575
until all of a sudden, where should we
end up but right back in front of the gate

271
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:53,621
and who should be coming in at
the same time, but the English teacher.

272
00:31:53,746 --> 00:31:56,332
You see, we had made a complete circle

273
00:31:56,457 --> 00:31:59,293
and ended up
right where we started from.

274
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:00,878
She was very masculine...

275
00:32:01,003 --> 00:32:02,797
- (Clock chimes)
- ...our English teacher.

276
00:32:02,922 --> 00:32:05,133
But quite, er...pretty.

277
00:32:06,134 --> 00:32:09,595
And many of the girls
had crushes on her.

278
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,015
I like to make a habit of, er...
turning this on early

279
00:32:13,141 --> 00:32:16,561
so that it's nice and warm
when I get into bed.

280
00:32:20,731 --> 00:32:24,318
I bought this for myself. My mother
would never have one, you know.

281
00:32:24,444 --> 00:32:28,698
She was afraid that, er...she would
be electrocuted in her sleep.

282
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:32,743
She was very old,
my mother, when she died,

283
00:32:32,869 --> 00:32:35,496
and I'm afraid she was a...a trifle senile.

284
00:32:37,665 --> 00:32:39,917
Were you warm enough last night?

285
00:32:40,042 --> 00:32:42,962
I wish that I had another one
of these to give to you.

286
00:32:44,714 --> 00:32:47,300
Would you like that?

287
00:32:47,425 --> 00:32:50,178
I could pick up one,
if you would like one.

288
00:32:51,971 --> 00:32:54,348
I'll have Mrs Parnell
pick up one tomorrow.

289
00:32:54,474 --> 00:32:56,350
She does that kind of thing for me.

290
00:32:56,476 --> 00:32:59,312
She's coming in tomorrow,
Mrs Parnell. Do you understand?

291
00:32:59,437 --> 00:33:01,314
She's coming in tomorrow, Thursday.

292
00:33:01,439 --> 00:33:04,317
She comes in on Tuesdays
and Thursdays.

293
00:33:04,442 --> 00:33:07,028
Now, there is no need for us
to explain why you're here.

294
00:33:07,153 --> 00:33:10,364
She works for me. This is my home.
I don't have to explain anything.

295
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:13,451
They used to work for my mother,
you see.

296
00:33:17,413 --> 00:33:19,415
Goodnight.

297
00:33:23,169 --> 00:33:27,048
Er...I'll bring you breakfast first thing
tomorrow morning at the same time.

298
00:33:27,173 --> 00:33:29,258
If that's all right.

299
00:33:29,383 --> 00:33:31,636
It's been a lovely day for me.

300
00:33:31,761 --> 00:33:33,804
I'm very glad you're here.

301
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:36,849
Goodnight.

302
00:34:11,092 --> 00:34:13,302
(Distant foghorn sounds)

303
00:34:57,054 --> 00:35:00,266
- (Chatter)
- (Dog barks)

304
00:35:02,977 --> 00:35:05,313
(Pop music plays)

305
00:35:07,106 --> 00:35:09,650
(Running upstairs)

306
00:35:11,193 --> 00:35:13,696
(Man) Do something useful.
Hold the baby, will you?

307
00:35:13,821 --> 00:35:16,699
Here, let's take these off.
That's a good girl.

308
00:35:16,824 --> 00:35:19,327
- Pop goes the weasel!
- Come on, honey.

309
00:35:19,452 --> 00:35:21,746
Where are they?

310
00:35:21,871 --> 00:35:23,372
- Bedtime.
- Bedtime?

311
00:35:23,497 --> 00:35:25,791
Bedtime.

312
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:28,044
- Oh, there she goes.
- (Baby cries)

313
00:35:28,169 --> 00:35:31,255
(Music plays)

314
00:35:36,093 --> 00:35:39,096
- Hey.
- (Man) You owe me five bucks for that.

315
00:35:39,221 --> 00:35:41,515
(Low chatter)

316
00:35:43,851 --> 00:35:46,854
(Music drowns speech)

317
00:35:48,481 --> 00:35:50,775
(Baby cries)

(Baby cries)

320
00:36:00,701 --> 00:36:02,620
(Man) Can't you stay to help your mother?

321
00:36:02,745 --> 00:36:05,247
(Woman) Turn the kettle on
if you're going in the kitchen.

322
00:36:05,373 --> 00:36:07,750
(Music playing)

323
00:36:09,627 --> 00:36:12,463
- (Baby cries)
- Aw, good girl.

324
00:36:12,588 --> 00:36:14,340
(Woman) Hey, wait a minute.

325
00:36:14,465 --> 00:36:16,967
Here's Nina's dress. Take it to her.

326
00:36:17,093 --> 00:36:19,095
(Dog barks)

327
00:36:21,931 --> 00:36:24,308

(Wind chimes)

334
00:37:10,354 --> 00:37:12,606
(Woman) Damn it, the cat...

335
00:37:15,651 --> 00:37:17,903
- Will you get out of here?
- (Foghorn sounds)

336
00:37:18,028 --> 00:37:20,114
Why don't you knock?

337
00:37:22,658 --> 00:37:25,745
- (Wind chimes)
- (Foghorn sounds)

338

- (Wind chimes)
- (Waves lapping)

339
00:37:38,132 --> 00:37:39,133
(Woman) Mm.

340
00:37:39,258 --> 00:37:41,594
(Bell sounds)

341
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:43,637
Mm.

342
00:37:44,597 --> 00:37:47,933
- (Foghorn sounds)
- Mm. Mm.

343
00:37:49,602 --> 00:37:51,061
Mm.

344
00:37:51,187 --> 00:37:54,565
- (Foghorn sounds)
- (She moans)

345

350
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,278
(Foghorn sounds)

351
00:38:45,616 --> 00:38:48,327
- (Wind chimes)
- (Foghorn sounds)

352
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:55,167
You can come in now.

353
00:38:55,292 --> 00:38:56,752
Come on.

354
00:39:03,634 --> 00:39:05,636
(Wind chimes)

355
00:39:13,894 --> 00:39:15,938
Close the door.

356
00:39:16,063 --> 00:39:18,774
(Foghorn sounds)

357
00:39:18,899 --> 00:39:20,067
You're not gonna put that sweater on.

358
00:39:20,192 --> 00:39:21,485
- It scratches.
- But I'm cold.

359
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:25,114
- (Door slides)
- Just a minute.

360
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:31,078
OK.

361
00:39:31,203 --> 00:39:33,205
(Bell sounds)

362
00:39:34,373 --> 00:39:36,876
- (Foghorn sounds)
- Where have you been?

363
00:39:37,001 --> 00:39:39,879
I've been sitting in Tatlow Park
for two days, waiting for you.

364
00:39:40,004 --> 00:39:41,922
- I see you brought my dress.
- Yeah, Sue picked it up for you.

365
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:44,633
You're burning those things again?

366
00:39:44,758 --> 00:39:46,594
Ooh, God.

367
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:49,972
- You mind if I just smoke mine?
- Yes, I do.

368
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:58,272
- Where are those papers?
- They're on the shelf there.

369
00:39:59,648 --> 00:40:02,526
- Found them.
- They're done.

370
00:40:02,651 --> 00:40:05,821
- (Foghorn sounds)
- I think.

371
00:40:05,946 --> 00:40:07,323
Oh, Jesus.

372
00:40:07,448 --> 00:40:09,575
Move, move, move, move, move.

373
00:40:11,243 --> 00:40:15,039
Hey, give me that.
It's got my eyelashes in.

374
00:40:21,337 --> 00:40:22,338
(Distant bell)

375
00:40:22,463 --> 00:40:24,214
- Did you see Mom?
- Yeah, I saw her.

376
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:26,091
- How is she?
- She's fine.

377
00:40:26,216 --> 00:40:28,260
It's me that nearly drowned.

378
00:40:28,385 --> 00:40:29,386
Sorry to hang you out,

379
00:40:29,511 --> 00:40:33,557
but we had a chance to cop some shit
in Seattle, so we hitched down.

380
00:40:33,682 --> 00:40:35,935
- They're good.
- Have a cookie, man.

381
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:38,354
Nice.

382
00:40:38,479 --> 00:40:40,064
Hm.

383
00:40:40,189 --> 00:40:42,816
Can't you just have a cookie?
Do you have to smoke that crap?

384
00:40:42,942 --> 00:40:46,820
I can't stand the smell of that smoke
and you know it.

385
00:40:46,946 --> 00:40:47,947
(He grunts)

386
00:40:48,072 --> 00:40:49,949
- What are you doing?
- I'm cold.

387
00:40:50,074 --> 00:40:52,701
- I could have frozen to death.
- Move over.

388
00:40:52,826 --> 00:40:54,078
How much grass
did you put in these things?

389
00:40:54,203 --> 00:40:56,121
Will you move over?

390
00:40:56,246 --> 00:40:59,792
- (Foghorn sounds)
- Anyway, I got picked up in the park.

391
00:40:59,917 --> 00:41:02,878
- Pigs? For what?
- Did you bring some food?

392
00:41:03,003 --> 00:41:06,674
There's bread and cheese in there,
and it wasn't the law. It was a lady.

393
00:41:06,799 --> 00:41:08,592
Mm, mm.

394
00:41:08,717 --> 00:41:12,221
Do you want to hear about this lady
that picked me up and gave me a bath?

395
00:41:12,346 --> 00:41:14,348
- A real bath?
- (Distant bell)

396
00:41:14,473 --> 00:41:16,392
- A bubble bath.
- A bubble bath?

397
00:41:16,517 --> 00:41:19,979
- How much did she pay you?
- Pay me for what?

398
00:41:20,104 --> 00:41:21,981
You know, for services.

399
00:41:22,106 --> 00:41:24,733
I mean, it's a well-known fact
that there's a service charge

400
00:41:24,858 --> 00:41:28,112
when old ladies take young boys in
for sexual purposes.

401
00:41:28,237 --> 00:41:34,034
That's right. It's like if your sister here
had any dough, she'd be paying me.

402
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:36,787
(They laugh)

403
00:41:39,748 --> 00:41:43,377
- (Bell sounds)
- How long did you stay with this lady?

404
00:41:43,502 --> 00:41:46,755
Till now, tonight, and she wasn't old.

405
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,217
- I never said she was old.
- Hey, she must have been pretty good.

406
00:41:50,342 --> 00:41:53,762
Listen, it was a hell of a lot better
than staying here or at home.

407
00:41:53,887 --> 00:41:55,806
I had my own room and my own bed.

408
00:41:55,931 --> 00:41:58,183
So, then, why did you leave,
if it was so groovy?

409
00:41:58,308 --> 00:42:02,312
- (Nina) Ow. Mm.
- (Foghorn sounds)

410
00:42:02,438 --> 00:42:05,983
I don't know.
I guess I just got tired of not talking.

411
00:42:06,108 --> 00:42:09,445
Christ. You mean, she didn't talk to you?

412
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:13,365
She didn't talk? That's all she did.
I was the one that didn't talk.

413
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:15,868
You're doing your number again, right?
Hey.

414
00:42:15,993 --> 00:42:18,037
You're doing your thing?
You're doing your number?

415
00:42:18,162 --> 00:42:19,705
(Nick) What thing?

416
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:23,709
(Nina) He's got this thing. He's been
doing it since he was a little kid.

417
00:42:23,834 --> 00:42:28,297
He doesn't talk. I mean...
I mean he doesn't talk for days.

418
00:42:28,422 --> 00:42:30,591
- So, why did you leave?
- He told you.

419
00:42:32,092 --> 00:42:34,970
Um...what did he tell her?

420
00:42:36,722 --> 00:42:41,268
He told you. He didn't tell her anything.
He didn't...he didn't talk to her.

421
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,689
Oh.

422
00:42:45,814 --> 00:42:47,858
(They laugh)

423
00:42:48,984 --> 00:42:53,697
She's a very strange lady. I've never
in my life heard anybody talk so much.

424
00:43:58,137 --> 00:44:00,180
(Clock ticks)

425
00:44:04,101 --> 00:44:06,812
(Mrs Parnell)
I've never seen such a beautiful day.

426
00:44:06,937 --> 00:44:09,064
Crime to stay indoors.

427
00:44:09,189 --> 00:44:10,858
You startled me.

428
00:44:10,983 --> 00:44:13,694
9.30, my usual time.

429
00:44:15,112 --> 00:44:17,948
Would you like a cup of coffee?
I'm afraid I didn't make tea this morning.

430
00:44:18,073 --> 00:44:22,619
No, thanks, clear. I'll get started.
What would you like me to do first?

431
00:44:22,744 --> 00:44:25,372
Make up the bed in the spare room.

432
00:44:25,497 --> 00:44:28,750
Make it up? Someone coming to stay?

433
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:32,004
No, I slept there last night.

434
00:44:32,129 --> 00:44:34,548
(Chuckles)

435
00:44:34,673 --> 00:44:37,885
(Clock ticks)

436
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:40,429
Oh, you haven't eaten your breakfast.

437
00:44:40,554 --> 00:44:42,556
No, I wasn't hungry.

438
00:44:44,892 --> 00:44:46,852
(Clock ticks)

439
00:44:48,645 --> 00:44:51,440
Why don't you go back to bed
for an hour while I clean up?

440
00:44:51,565 --> 00:44:54,026
No, I think I'll take a bath.

441
00:45:01,658 --> 00:45:03,660
Let me know when you want your lunch.

442
00:45:03,785 --> 00:45:05,704
I'm not hungry.

443
00:45:05,829 --> 00:45:07,831
Why don't you have a cup of bouillon?

444
00:45:07,956 --> 00:45:10,417
That won't hurt you. It goes down easily.

445
00:45:10,542 --> 00:45:12,336
I don't want anything to eat, Mrs Parnell.

446
00:45:12,461 --> 00:45:14,713
You go ahead and have your lunch.

447
00:45:14,838 --> 00:45:17,090
(Doorbell rings)

448
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:38,779
Yes?

449
00:45:38,904 --> 00:45:42,032
Look here, you hop it.
We're not buying anything.

450
00:45:42,157 --> 00:45:46,912
Come in, please. It's all right, Mrs
Parnell. It's a friend of mine. Come in.

451
00:45:47,037 --> 00:45:49,539
Please sit.

452
00:45:51,333 --> 00:45:54,044
Sit down. I'm glad you came back.

453
00:45:55,963 --> 00:45:57,965
This for me? Thank you.

454
00:46:01,677 --> 00:46:05,222
It's cookies? Are they from a bakery?

455
00:46:05,347 --> 00:46:09,184
They look home-made.
Did you make them yourself, then?

456
00:46:13,438 --> 00:46:15,482
Let me take your coat.

457
00:46:22,197 --> 00:46:24,449
Do you want me to finish
cleaning up in here?

458
00:46:24,574 --> 00:46:26,994
No, you can leave the rest today.

459
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:29,913
If you have anything you want to do,
please feel free to go ahead.

460
00:46:30,038 --> 00:46:33,500
Why don't you have your lunch and go
ahead? Are you hungry? Would you...

461
00:46:33,625 --> 00:46:34,793
(Mrs Parnell) Do you want me
to get you some lunch?

462
00:46:34,918 --> 00:46:39,047
No. You get yours.
You get your own. I'll get ours.

463
00:46:42,759 --> 00:46:45,512
I'll put these on a tray
and we can eat in here, all right?

464
00:46:52,269 --> 00:46:54,438
Mrs Parnell, I wish you would
have something to eat.

465
00:46:54,563 --> 00:46:58,025
I'm all right. You're busy.
I don't want to be in the way.

466
00:46:58,150 --> 00:47:02,404
Don't be silly. You could at least
have a cup of coffee.

467
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:06,783
Where is that corkscrew?

468
00:47:06,908 --> 00:47:08,869
Here.

469
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:15,250
(Clock ticks)

470
00:47:16,877 --> 00:47:19,046
Do you want to use that wine?

471
00:47:19,171 --> 00:47:22,049
That's the very good wine. The one
the doctor likes with his steak.

472
00:47:22,174 --> 00:47:24,134
Yes, I want the very good wine.

473
00:47:24,259 --> 00:47:27,804
What could I have with the cookies?
Perhaps I... I could have some fruit.

474
00:47:27,929 --> 00:47:31,058
Would you just finish that
for me, please?

475
00:47:31,183 --> 00:47:33,226
(Clock ticks)

476
00:47:47,491 --> 00:47:51,286
- These cookies don't look very nice.
- I think he made them himself.

477
00:47:51,411 --> 00:47:54,081
But they're all burned.
Someone's been scraping them.

478
00:47:54,206 --> 00:47:55,624
Please. I wish you wouldn't go on
about the cookies.

479
00:47:55,749 --> 00:47:59,586
- You're not going to have to eat them.
- And I wouldn't.

480
00:47:59,711 --> 00:48:01,838
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to snap at you.

481
00:48:01,963 --> 00:48:05,175
It's just that everything's
coming up at one time.

482
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:07,803
Parnell and I will be in
for your bridge party.

483
00:48:07,928 --> 00:48:10,055
No, I think everything's
been changed around.

484
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:13,308
I think I'm going over there or they're
coming over here the week after.

485
00:48:13,433 --> 00:48:15,560
I can't remember right now.

486
00:48:26,905 --> 00:48:29,074
(Door shuts)

487
00:49:23,753 --> 00:49:25,755
Huh.

488
00:49:26,965 --> 00:49:28,258
(Tuts)

489
00:49:28,383 --> 00:49:30,635
Lord. You must...

490
00:49:34,681 --> 00:49:36,725
I'm not dressed.

491
00:49:41,104 --> 00:49:44,441
Well...excuse me.

492
00:49:44,566 --> 00:49:48,487
I must go get dressed.
Will you excuse me, please?

493
00:51:22,122 --> 00:51:23,873
(Screams)

494
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:30,130
Did I frighten you?

495
00:51:32,549 --> 00:51:34,801
I frightened you.

496
00:51:34,926 --> 00:51:37,095
(She laughs)

497
00:51:39,014 --> 00:51:42,267
You know what I was doing?
I was playing blind...

498
00:51:44,436 --> 00:51:45,854
...man's bluff.

499
00:51:45,979 --> 00:51:48,940
Yes, blind man's bluff.
You know how to play that?

500
00:51:49,065 --> 00:51:53,278
We used to play it in school.
You know what this is that I found?

501
00:51:57,616 --> 00:51:59,534
You have three guesses.

502
00:52:00,327 --> 00:52:02,537
One.

503
00:52:02,662 --> 00:52:04,080
No.

504
00:52:06,625 --> 00:52:09,002
Two.

505
00:52:09,127 --> 00:52:11,713
No, it's not that at all.

506
00:52:14,466 --> 00:52:16,509
That's my school...

507
00:52:17,636 --> 00:52:19,387
...uh...

508
00:52:20,722 --> 00:52:21,723
...necktie.

509
00:52:22,807 --> 00:52:24,851
(Snorts)

510
00:52:24,976 --> 00:52:26,603
(Giggles)

511
00:52:26,728 --> 00:52:29,105
See, that's the, er...that's the red.

512
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:31,274
That symbolises the flame...

513
00:52:32,859 --> 00:52:34,861
...in my heart.

514
00:52:34,986 --> 00:52:38,823
Here. You wear it.
It's very lovely on you.

515
00:52:38,948 --> 00:52:42,952
And this is my harmonica. I found
it in the drawer, you see. Yes.

516
00:52:43,078 --> 00:52:45,538
- (Blows notes)
- Very good.

517
00:52:47,916 --> 00:52:49,668
(She laughs)

518
00:52:51,336 --> 00:52:53,254
Let me have it.

519
00:52:54,255 --> 00:52:56,758
I want to show you how...

520
00:52:56,883 --> 00:53:01,846
I used to have to stand
in front of a mirror in the...

521
00:53:04,891 --> 00:53:06,810
<i>I mean...</i>

522
00:53:10,689 --> 00:53:13,650
Oh! Yes.

523
00:53:13,775 --> 00:53:15,860
Yes.

524
00:53:15,985 --> 00:53:18,113
That's it. Through...through the loop.

525
00:53:19,322 --> 00:53:21,908
That...that's right. That's very nice.

526
00:53:22,033 --> 00:53:23,993
Thank you.

527
00:53:26,871 --> 00:53:28,873
Do you like that?

528
00:53:38,633 --> 00:53:40,552
<i>Oh...</i>

529
00:53:44,097 --> 00:53:46,099
...come here.

530
00:54:08,288 --> 00:54:10,290
(She blows mouth organ)

531
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:22,302
(She blows mouth organ)

532
00:54:27,265 --> 00:54:29,017
(She blows mouth organ)

533
00:54:42,489 --> 00:54:43,490
(Mouth organ squeaks)

534
00:54:45,867 --> 00:54:47,786
Ah. Oh, Oh, Oh!

535
00:54:47,911 --> 00:54:49,746
No.

536
00:54:49,871 --> 00:54:52,874
I'm sorry. Come on, get up.

537
00:54:52,999 --> 00:54:54,959
Come on. Up.

538
00:54:56,169 --> 00:54:58,797
Here.

539
00:54:58,922 --> 00:55:01,424
Straight-ahead.

540
00:55:01,549 --> 00:55:03,593
(Plays mouth organ)

541
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:21,861
(Plays mouth organ)

542
00:55:21,986 --> 00:55:23,822
There.

543
00:57:40,291 --> 00:57:43,127
(Door opens)

544
00:57:43,252 --> 00:57:45,630
(Frances) 'I have to go out.

545
00:57:45,755 --> 00:57:50,551
'I'm afraid that I will be gone most
of the day. I have an appointment.

546
00:57:50,677 --> 00:57:52,637
'There's this bowling tournament

547
00:57:52,762 --> 00:57:57,183
'and it's just a club thing, you see,
but I feel that I have to be there.

548
00:57:58,476 --> 00:58:03,356
'If you're hungry, there's plenty to eat
in the kitchen. You just help yourself.

549
00:58:05,024 --> 00:58:07,402
'I should be back around eight o'clock.

550
00:58:09,988 --> 00:58:12,907
'I promise that I won't be
any later than eight o'clock.'

551
00:58:13,032 --> 00:58:14,659
(Woman) How much longer do we have?

552
00:58:14,784 --> 00:58:16,285
(Woman no. 2)
You have an appointment, don't you?

553
00:58:16,411 --> 00:58:19,998
No, I didn't have one before I got here.
She just told me to sit down and wait.

554
00:58:20,123 --> 00:58:24,168
But there seems to be
so many people in and out.

555
00:58:24,293 --> 00:58:27,213
(Woman no. 2) You might as well
just make yourself comfortable.

556
00:58:27,338 --> 00:58:29,298
Just relax. You seem a little bit nervous.

557
00:58:29,424 --> 00:58:32,677
(Woman no. 1) Worst of all, I was here
last week and spent two hours waiting.

558
00:58:32,802 --> 00:58:34,178
Finally they sent me home.

559
00:58:34,303 --> 00:58:36,556
- Really?
- So, I guess this man's pretty busy.

560
00:58:36,681 --> 00:58:38,850
He seems to have
an interesting product.

561
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:40,935
Austen, Frances Austen.
I have an appointment.

562
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:43,521
- (Woman no. 2) Have you children?
- (Woman no. 1) I have four children.

563
00:58:43,646 --> 00:58:44,647
That's plenty.

564
00:58:44,772 --> 00:58:46,983
It's lovely, lovely,
but, yes, I've had enough

565
00:58:47,108 --> 00:58:50,236
and I don't care to worry
about enlargement.

566
00:58:50,361 --> 00:58:52,321
(Woman on tannoy) 'Dr Devlin
to emergency room.'

567
00:58:52,447 --> 00:58:54,574
Are you taking the pill?

568
00:58:54,699 --> 00:58:57,076
Well, I think, the pill...
I've heard stories.

569
00:58:57,201 --> 00:59:00,955
That the, er...that the little thing
that fits up inside, right?

570
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:02,874
- Yes, the coil.
- Yeah.

571
00:59:02,999 --> 00:59:05,960
I understand that every once in a while
they deliver very healthy babies.

572
00:59:06,085 --> 00:59:10,673
After four of those
I think I'll try the very safe one.

573
00:59:10,798 --> 00:59:12,925
Except I understand they put
pounds and pounds on you...

574
00:59:13,051 --> 00:59:16,429
They do actually put ten pounds
on you. What are you going to ask for?

575
00:59:16,554 --> 00:59:19,390
Well, I was hoping to get...to get the pill

576
00:59:19,515 --> 00:59:20,641
because I sort of assumed

577
00:59:20,767 --> 00:59:24,645
that they would just listen to your heart
and take your blood pressure.

578
00:59:24,771 --> 00:59:27,732
- Oh, no. They have to examine you.
- Oh, do they?

579
00:59:27,857 --> 00:59:29,525
- Always.
- Oh, they do?

580
00:59:29,650 --> 00:59:31,903
- (Tannoy) 'Dr Johnson, line five.'
- It's not that bad.

581
00:59:32,028 --> 00:59:34,197
- You've never had it done before?
- Yes, I have.

582
00:59:34,322 --> 00:59:35,990
That's why I was sort of...

583
00:59:36,115 --> 00:59:39,702
That's interesting. It's been years
since anything like that's bothered me.

584
00:59:39,827 --> 00:59:43,206
I'm nervous, I guess.
I've already been through it once.

585
00:59:43,331 --> 00:59:46,501
It's been a long time since I had
my first one, I can tell you.

586
00:59:46,626 --> 00:59:48,628
I can imagine.
How many children do you have?

587
00:59:48,753 --> 00:59:50,171
I wouldn't think you'd be nervous
after having...

588
00:59:50,296 --> 00:59:53,591
Oh, no, I'm sure I wouldn't
if I had any children.

589
00:59:53,716 --> 00:59:57,303
- But I don't have. I'm not married.
- Oh, I see.

590
00:59:57,428 --> 00:59:58,429
I think that's very good.

591
00:59:58,554 --> 01:00:02,058
If more girls came to a place like this
before they got themselves in trouble,

592
01:00:02,183 --> 01:00:04,227
their lives'd be a lot easier on them.

593
01:00:04,352 --> 01:00:09,732
I really don't know anything
and my mother will never talk about it.

594
01:00:09,857 --> 01:00:11,651
Well, no. Every time I use...

595
01:00:11,776 --> 01:00:14,195
Like, uh...the diaphragm
didn't work for me

596
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:16,364
and when it's condoms,
I don't know, whatever happens...

597
01:00:16,489 --> 01:00:19,242
I think that men get all excited
and put them on wrong or something,

598
01:00:19,367 --> 01:00:21,369
because two of my children
were born with those

599
01:00:21,494 --> 01:00:24,455
- so anyway...
- They take it very seriously.

600
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:28,292
Somebody told me that in every box
there's one with a hole in.

601
01:00:28,417 --> 01:00:30,211
That's sad.

602
01:00:30,336 --> 01:00:32,171
You've been married
a couple years now?

603
01:00:32,296 --> 01:00:34,966
Well, I started with the intrauterine device,

604
01:00:35,091 --> 01:00:37,301
but, believe it or not,
my husband said he could feel it.

605
01:00:37,426 --> 01:00:40,304
You mean some men
are bigger than others?

606
01:00:40,429 --> 01:00:41,722
Yeah, you could say that.

607
01:00:41,848 --> 01:00:44,517
I thought they were all, within reason,
about the same size.

608
01:00:44,642 --> 01:00:47,436
No, just like girls, they're all different.

609
01:00:47,562 --> 01:00:48,646
Well, I think that'd be right,

610
01:00:48,771 --> 01:00:53,151
because if you want a diaphragm
you have to get...fitted for one.

611
01:00:53,276 --> 01:00:55,361
Well, maybe they'll give you
the diaphragm.

612
01:00:55,486 --> 01:00:57,446
If you don't feel good,
they're still going to make you...

613
01:00:57,572 --> 01:01:01,617
- No, he wanted to get me the pill...
- But I think it's naive...

614
01:01:01,742 --> 01:01:03,578
Just a minute.
Don't forget your umbrella.

615
01:01:04,579 --> 01:01:05,621
- Well, I think the pill...
- Bye.

616
01:01:05,746 --> 01:01:07,373
- Bye.
- ...would be easiest.

617
01:01:07,498 --> 01:01:10,585
Yes, it is the easiest
but sometimes it puts weight on you.

618
01:01:10,710 --> 01:01:13,129
Let's face it,
are you ready for ten pounds?

619
01:01:13,254 --> 01:01:15,673
You just have to be
a little more careful.

620
01:01:15,798 --> 01:01:19,010
- (Woman) Miss Austen?
- I've never really had a problem...

621
01:01:19,135 --> 01:01:20,428
Miss Austen?

622
01:01:20,553 --> 01:01:24,307
If I had to lose weight,
I probably couldn't do it.

623
01:01:24,432 --> 01:01:25,516
If you go right to the end of the hall.

624
01:01:25,641 --> 01:01:27,727
It might spoil the whole thing.

625
01:01:27,852 --> 01:01:31,647
You get all jazzed up and they have
to go in and do all that junk for you.

626
01:01:31,772 --> 01:01:34,400
Well, if you're there, the guy's trading...

627
01:01:34,525 --> 01:01:36,944
Oh, come in.

628
01:01:37,069 --> 01:01:39,197
Do sit down.

629
01:01:39,322 --> 01:01:41,782
May I have your card, please?

630
01:01:43,618 --> 01:01:45,620
Thank you very much.

631
01:01:46,871 --> 01:01:49,874
Ah, let me see now. Miss Austen, is it?

632
01:01:49,999 --> 01:01:51,250
Yes.

633
01:01:51,375 --> 01:01:53,294
Er...single?

634
01:01:53,419 --> 01:01:54,879
Yes, I'm going to be married.

635
01:01:55,004 --> 01:01:57,715
Oh, how nice.
Have you ever been pregnant?

636
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:01,052
- No.
- Well, that simplifies everything.

637
01:02:01,177 --> 01:02:04,347
Dr Mackenzie is going to examine you
and he's considered very good.

638
01:02:04,472 --> 01:02:06,766
Will you come with me?

639
01:02:11,437 --> 01:02:13,314
Oh.

640
01:02:13,439 --> 01:02:15,942
Well, that wasn't so bad, was it?

641
01:02:17,610 --> 01:02:19,362
Come in. There you are.

642
01:02:19,487 --> 01:02:21,864
Now, if you'll just take your clothes off
and put on that gown,

643
01:02:21,989 --> 01:02:24,825
the doctor will be with you in a minute.

644
01:03:29,765 --> 01:03:31,684
(Knocking)

645
01:03:37,064 --> 01:03:38,899
(Knocking)

646
01:03:45,906 --> 01:03:47,908
(Knock)

647
01:03:49,327 --> 01:03:52,496
Oh, for Christ's sake.
What are you doing here?

648
01:03:52,621 --> 01:03:54,081
- Where is she?
- What are you doing here?

649
01:03:54,206 --> 01:03:57,001
What do you mean? I want to see.

650
01:04:00,755 --> 01:04:02,506
Where's the war hero?

651
01:04:02,631 --> 01:04:06,594
I think he's working.
Hey, is this your room?

652
01:04:06,719 --> 01:04:08,179
Not bad.

653
01:04:08,304 --> 01:04:11,807
Come on, Nina. You're gonna get me
in a hell of a lot of trouble.

654
01:04:11,932 --> 01:04:14,185
What's this crap?

655
01:04:15,353 --> 01:04:18,564
Will you put it down?
She could be back here any minute.

656
01:04:22,026 --> 01:04:24,195
Frances, you're late. I tried to phone.

657
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:26,906
- Yes, I know. I am sorry.
- There was no answer.

658
01:04:27,031 --> 01:04:29,575
- I had some errands to run.
- It's very damp today.

659
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:32,078
- Oh, Miss Austen, you're here!
- Yes, I won't be a moment.

660
01:04:32,203 --> 01:04:33,996
Good afternoon, Miss Austen.

661
01:04:34,121 --> 01:04:35,790
You got here.
We were worried about you.

662
01:04:35,915 --> 01:04:37,249
Oh, yes.

663
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:40,336
- Frances, you're late.
- I know.

664
01:04:40,461 --> 01:04:43,339
(Speech drowned out
by aeroplane overhead)

665
01:04:56,102 --> 01:04:57,728
For crying out loud!
You can't take a bath.

666
01:04:57,853 --> 01:05:00,523
- Get your little grubby hands off!
- She's gonna walk in here any second!

667
01:05:00,648 --> 01:05:03,401
I'm gonna take a bath.
Now leave it alone.

668
01:05:03,526 --> 01:05:05,569
But you can't. She's gonna walk
in the door any minute now.

669
01:05:05,694 --> 01:05:07,613
- You had a bath.
- That's different. She gave it to me.

670
01:05:07,738 --> 01:05:09,949
I'm gonna have a bath.

671
01:05:14,578 --> 01:05:18,666
- You're gonna get in a lot of trouble.
- She's not gonna mind, I'm sure.

672
01:05:20,835 --> 01:05:24,422
- After all, I am your big sister.
- Oh, come on. Will you cut it out?

673
01:05:29,135 --> 01:05:33,013
I mean, it's not like I get a bath
every day or anything like that.

674
01:05:33,139 --> 01:05:34,723
I can't have a bath in the houseboat.

675
01:05:34,849 --> 01:05:37,184
There's one at home
if you want to use it.

676
01:05:37,309 --> 01:05:38,352
(Nina) You should talk!

677
01:05:38,477 --> 01:05:41,522
Hey, come on. You know I spend a hell
of a lot more time at home than you do.

678
01:05:41,647 --> 01:05:45,484
This lady keeps her bathroom
equipped with junk.

679
01:05:50,948 --> 01:05:53,659
Hey, don't use any of that.
She's gonna know it's gone.

680
01:05:53,784 --> 01:05:56,787
- Good. Maybe she'll think you used it.
- Oh...

681
01:05:58,664 --> 01:05:59,957
Come on. Just hurry up, all right, please?

682
01:06:00,082 --> 01:06:02,626
She sure has some nifty things.

683
01:06:15,181 --> 01:06:17,725
I don't know when she's gonna be
home. Will you please hurry up?

684
01:06:17,850 --> 01:06:20,853
I'm gonna take my time!
Now will you relax?

685
01:06:23,439 --> 01:06:27,276
I told you, it's not like I get to take
a bath every day or something.

686
01:06:36,243 --> 01:06:39,371
Little wretch, depriving your sister
of a bath...

687
01:06:53,636 --> 01:06:54,720
(She sighs)

688
01:06:54,845 --> 01:06:58,849
Get me a...get me something, quick!
Get me a towel!

689
01:06:58,974 --> 01:07:00,309
There's one right behind you.

690
01:07:00,434 --> 01:07:04,271
I know, but I'm using it. Get me
something quick! Quick, quick, quick!

691
01:07:05,272 --> 01:07:07,233
Oh!Oh!

692
01:07:07,358 --> 01:07:09,235
- Here! Here!
- (indistinct)

693
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:12,947
Well, get it! My eyelash is coming off.

694
01:07:16,242 --> 01:07:17,993
Hey! What the...

695
01:07:18,118 --> 01:07:20,704
My pants are on! What are you doing?!

696
01:07:20,829 --> 01:07:22,498
Ha-ha-ha!

697
01:07:22,623 --> 01:07:26,835
All right, that's it for you now, kiddo!
That's it for you!

698
01:07:26,961 --> 01:07:29,171
You know who should be in here,
don't you?

699
01:07:29,296 --> 01:07:31,715
- All right, now you're gonna get it.
- No!

700
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,717
Oh!

701
01:07:35,052 --> 01:07:39,515
Now, you know we gotta cool it
because she's gonna see this stuff!

702
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:43,561
(Coughs) I wish I had my boatie.
Remember my boatie?

703
01:07:43,686 --> 01:07:45,521
I remember your duck. You remember?

704
01:07:45,646 --> 01:07:48,732
The duck was yours. The boatie was
mine, kid. It was a submarine.

705
01:07:48,857 --> 01:07:50,985
- Get over, John.
- Mom, you stand here.

706
01:07:51,110 --> 01:07:53,404
(Man) It's cold out here.

707
01:07:55,281 --> 01:07:58,075
That's a dandy.

708
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:00,995
Mid-season form.

709
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:03,289
(Woman) We're by the lane.

710
01:08:03,414 --> 01:08:06,792
- (Man) Here I am doing all the work.
- (Man no. 2) Let it go to the other end.

711
01:08:09,503 --> 01:08:10,713
(Woman) More or less from here.

712
01:08:10,838 --> 01:08:14,008
(Man) Oh, yes, it's quite easy.
They won't know the difference.

713
01:08:14,133 --> 01:08:18,387
- (Woman) Do you want to hold my coat?
- (Man) I'll hold you too.

714
01:08:18,512 --> 01:08:21,473
Well, are you having a bad day?

715
01:08:21,599 --> 01:08:22,975
It's much too cold for this.

716
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:25,227
This'll warm you up.

717
01:08:26,687 --> 01:08:29,231
- I think it's going to rain.
- Oh, I don't think so.

718
01:08:29,356 --> 01:08:32,693
- (Frances) How much longer will we be?
- Just another hour, that's all.

719
01:08:32,818 --> 01:08:35,988
- I wish Nicky was here.
- Well, he isn't.

720
01:08:36,113 --> 01:08:40,200
I wish anybody was here.
Mm, I wish you weren't my brother.

721
01:08:40,326 --> 01:08:42,536
Well, I am. Now will you come on
and get dressed?

722
01:08:42,661 --> 01:08:44,788
Ha.

723
01:08:46,498 --> 01:08:49,585
- Do you wish I wasn't your sister?
- Now, what's that supposed to mean?

724
01:08:51,629 --> 01:08:52,671
Do I excite you?

725
01:08:52,796 --> 01:08:54,506
How about going by the house?

726
01:08:54,632 --> 01:08:57,217
How long's it been since
you've seen Mom? Along time.

727
01:08:57,343 --> 01:08:59,637
(Laughs)

728
01:08:59,762 --> 01:09:00,763
Come here.

729
01:09:00,888 --> 01:09:02,306
Huh?

730
01:09:02,431 --> 01:09:04,725
- Come here.
- What for?

731
01:09:07,436 --> 01:09:09,813
Well, I have this...

732
01:09:09,938 --> 01:09:11,815
this stiff neck.

733
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:13,275
Mm...

734
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:15,569
Jesus, Nina.
You know, you're really crazy.

735
01:09:17,321 --> 01:09:19,615
I do excite you,
because you're afraid of me.

736
01:09:19,740 --> 01:09:22,451
Oh, for crying out loud.

737
01:09:22,576 --> 01:09:25,329
Where does it hurt?

738
01:09:25,454 --> 01:09:27,956
OK.

739
01:09:28,082 --> 01:09:30,167
Come on, sit down.

740
01:09:32,086 --> 01:09:33,545
Hm?

741
01:09:33,671 --> 01:09:36,298
Uh...gentle!

742
01:09:36,423 --> 01:09:38,676
Higher.

743
01:09:38,801 --> 01:09:40,803
Higher.

744
01:09:45,557 --> 01:09:47,559
Come on.

745
01:09:51,814 --> 01:09:52,940
Hon.

746
01:09:53,065 --> 01:09:54,733
What?

747
01:09:56,652 --> 01:09:59,113
You've got some sleep in your eye.

748
01:09:59,238 --> 01:10:01,657
- For Christ's sake!
- (Laughs)

749
01:10:05,327 --> 01:10:07,746
- (Frances) You needn't see me up.
- (Charles) Oh, don't be silly.

750
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:09,873
(Frances) To tell you the truth,
I'm not feeling very well.

751
01:10:09,998 --> 01:10:12,251
I think perhaps I caught a chill tonight.

752
01:10:12,376 --> 01:10:14,461
(Charles) We'd better give you
something for that, then.

753
01:10:14,586 --> 01:10:16,463
(Frances) Maybe it's only that I'm tired.

754
01:10:16,588 --> 01:10:19,383
(Charles) Mm-hm, now, look, Frances,

755
01:10:19,508 --> 01:10:22,469
you know I've been angling
to get you alone for some time now.

756
01:10:22,594 --> 01:10:25,264
(Frances) I wouldn't object
at any other time, but it's so late.

757
01:10:25,389 --> 01:10:27,725
(Charles) It's only 9.30.

758
01:11:14,521 --> 01:11:16,356
(Lock clicks)

759
01:11:23,906 --> 01:11:27,159
- May I have a brandy, please?
- Yes, help yourself.

760
01:11:27,284 --> 01:11:29,536
Thank you.

761
01:11:38,337 --> 01:11:40,756
(Glass clinks)

762
01:11:44,343 --> 01:11:46,303
I'd like a brandy and soda, please.

763
01:11:46,428 --> 01:11:48,514
Certainly.

764
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:56,480
(Clock ticks)

765
01:12:13,580 --> 01:12:16,750
- Got a headache?
- No, I don't.

766
01:12:16,875 --> 01:12:18,669
I don't have a headache.

767
01:12:18,794 --> 01:12:20,921
(Charles) You soon will have,
if you don't relax.

768
01:12:21,046 --> 01:12:23,590
(Clock ticks)

769
01:12:23,715 --> 01:12:26,093
I'm just tired.

770
01:12:26,218 --> 01:12:28,387
(Charles) Frances.

771
01:12:28,512 --> 01:12:30,889
We've known each other
for some time now.

772
01:12:31,014 --> 01:12:32,015
May I say something

773
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:37,062
that, coming from a stranger,
might seem somewhat impertinent?

774
01:12:37,187 --> 01:12:39,648
I've never discussed your personal life.

775
01:12:39,773 --> 01:12:44,278
Our friendship, and I think of it
as a very sincere friendship,

776
01:12:44,403 --> 01:12:46,780
has only just grazed the surface.

777
01:12:47,990 --> 01:12:53,662
What I'm trying to say is that
this isn't just a sudden whim.

778
01:12:53,787 --> 01:12:57,332
It's something I've given
a great deal of thought to.

779
01:12:57,457 --> 01:13:00,961
I'm sure that at times you've felt
the need of another person's love.

780
01:13:01,962 --> 01:13:05,966
(Man) OK, I want you just to bend your
knees now and wiggle on down the table

781
01:13:06,091 --> 01:13:09,094
and then put your feet out here
in the stirrups, just like that.

782
01:13:09,219 --> 01:13:11,179
That's fine. That's good.

783
01:13:11,305 --> 01:13:15,100
Now, see if you can just wiggle on
down a little more, OK?

784
01:13:16,602 --> 01:13:18,854
- (Charles) 'You all right?'
- (Frances) 'Yes.'

785
01:13:18,979 --> 01:13:19,980
(Charles) 'Are you sure you're all right?'

786
01:13:20,105 --> 01:13:23,525
(Frances) 'Yes, it's just been
a long, trying day, that's all.'

787
01:13:23,650 --> 01:13:27,571
(Charles) 'Frances, people always
tell doctors their problems.

788
01:13:27,696 --> 01:13:32,784
'They never seem to realise that,
well, doctors have problems too

789
01:13:32,910 --> 01:13:35,370
'and loneliness is a problem.

790
01:13:35,495 --> 01:13:40,000
'I am lonely, Frances. I'm just like other
people. I need someone to care about.'

791
01:13:40,125 --> 01:13:43,003
(Frances) 'Charles, I'd much rather you
wouldn't go on with this conversation.'

792
01:13:43,128 --> 01:13:46,048
- (Charles) 'I'm sorry. I didn't...'
- (Frances) 'I'm sorry.'

793
01:13:46,173 --> 01:13:48,133
(Charles) 'Frances, I hope
you didn't misunderstand.

794
01:13:48,258 --> 01:13:49,259
'When I used the word love...'

795
01:13:49,384 --> 01:13:52,512
(Man) That's fine.
Your ovaries appear to be normal.

796
01:13:52,638 --> 01:13:54,723
(Charles) 'I didn't mean I...

797
01:13:54,848 --> 01:13:57,893
'What I meant was warmth,
understanding, affection.

798
01:13:58,018 --> 01:14:02,397
'I didn't just mean... I hope you don't
think I would be so presumptuous.

799
01:14:02,522 --> 01:14:04,733
'I would never do anything to offend you.

800
01:14:04,858 --> 01:14:06,443
'Perhaps, in time,
your feelings might change.'

801
01:14:06,568 --> 01:14:09,154
(Frances) 'Charles, please.

802
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:11,114
'I'm afraid it's my fault.'

803
01:14:11,239 --> 01:14:12,783
(Man) and that's all there is to it.

804
01:14:12,908 --> 01:14:15,452
- I'd better go.
- Yes.

805
01:14:21,333 --> 01:14:24,628
(Charles) May I phone you tomorrow,
please?

806
01:14:24,753 --> 01:14:26,797
Sleep well.

807
01:14:32,636 --> 01:14:34,471
(Door shuts)

808
01:15:38,035 --> 01:15:39,995
(Door creaks)

809
01:15:46,126 --> 01:15:48,336
Are you awake?

810
01:15:50,464 --> 01:15:52,424
I can't sleep.

811
01:15:54,718 --> 01:15:57,137
It was such a long, tiring day for me.

812
01:15:57,262 --> 01:16:00,348
I suppose that I am too tired
to go to sleep.

813
01:16:00,474 --> 01:16:04,686
And then, too, it is strange, knowing
that someone else is in the house.

814
01:16:06,104 --> 01:16:08,565
I'm so used to being here alone.

815
01:16:12,736 --> 01:16:14,863
I wonder...

816
01:16:15,989 --> 01:16:18,450
...do you think that I'm lonely?

817
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:24,706
I am, you know, but, um...
I don't think about it.

818
01:16:25,832 --> 01:16:29,211
I remember my mother never stopped
saying how lonely she was

819
01:16:29,336 --> 01:16:31,254
after my father died.

820
01:16:31,379 --> 01:16:33,298
She kept talking on and on,

821
01:16:33,423 --> 01:16:36,676
always reminding me
how little company I was for her.

822
01:16:38,428 --> 01:16:42,766
But she was an old woman
and senile and it's...

823
01:16:42,891 --> 01:16:44,684
I don't think about it.

824
01:16:44,810 --> 01:16:49,397
Old people disgust me
with their feelings, sometimes.

825
01:16:54,528 --> 01:16:57,864
I wonder, do you think that I'm old?
Do you think that?

826
01:16:57,989 --> 01:17:00,033
(Clock chimes)

827
01:17:03,453 --> 01:17:05,705
You know, er...

828
01:17:07,124 --> 01:17:09,167
...I have this friend.

829
01:17:12,212 --> 01:17:14,506
Er...he's a doctor...

830
01:17:16,675 --> 01:17:20,137
...and he wants to make love to me
all the time.

831
01:17:20,262 --> 01:17:22,305
All the time.

832
01:17:22,430 --> 01:17:25,142
I find him very unattractive.

833
01:17:27,769 --> 01:17:32,190
But he still wants me.
I don't like to have him touch me.

834
01:17:32,315 --> 01:17:35,569
He reminds me of an old man.
He smells like an old man.

835
01:17:35,694 --> 01:17:40,824
I've known him for, Oh, ten years
and it's always been the same.

836
01:17:41,825 --> 01:17:43,952
Always the same.

837
01:17:45,912 --> 01:17:47,831
He's immaculate.

838
01:17:47,956 --> 01:17:50,292
His shirts and his shoes.

839
01:17:52,878 --> 01:17:56,214
Do you remember the shoes that
you wore the first day you came here?

840
01:17:56,339 --> 01:17:58,925
The shoes,
you had no laces in your shoes,

841
01:17:59,050 --> 01:18:01,386
and then you went without socks.

842
01:18:01,511 --> 01:18:04,264
I've never seen anyone go about
without socks before.

843
01:18:04,389 --> 01:18:06,892
It gave me such a peculiar feeling.

844
01:18:08,351 --> 01:18:11,062
His shoes are very well heeled...

845
01:18:12,105 --> 01:18:14,024
...and shiny...

846
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:18,361
...and rather small,

847
01:18:18,486 --> 01:18:21,531
and when he sits, you can see his
maroon garters that hold his socks up

848
01:18:21,656 --> 01:18:26,786
and he has a terr...terrible habit
of plucking at the creases...

849
01:18:28,079 --> 01:18:29,664
...in the knees of his trousers.

850
01:18:29,789 --> 01:18:34,002
Do you know the kind of person
that I'm trying to tell you about?

851
01:18:38,131 --> 01:18:40,133
I expect he needs me.

852
01:18:41,134 --> 01:18:45,931
But I have never felt the slightest bit of
desire for him, even out of loneliness.

853
01:18:46,056 --> 01:18:48,308
He disgusts me.

854
01:18:58,610 --> 01:19:02,197
I wish I knew whether you were
really asleep or just pretending.

855
01:19:02,322 --> 01:19:06,368
You are very clever
at pretending not to understand.

856
01:19:08,411 --> 01:19:11,289
Do you mind if I lay down on the bed?

857
01:19:12,457 --> 01:19:16,086
I'm not going to get under the covers.
I'm just going to lay on the top.

858
01:19:16,211 --> 01:19:18,213
Just here, just like this.

859
01:19:19,339 --> 01:19:21,549
I want to tell you something.

860
01:19:24,970 --> 01:19:30,517
If you feel you want to make love
to me, er...it's all right.

861
01:19:35,272 --> 01:19:37,524
I want you to make love to me.

862
01:19:46,741 --> 01:19:48,702
(Whispers) Please.

863
01:20:02,924 --> 01:20:05,051
(She screams)

864
01:20:05,176 --> 01:20:06,761
(Screams)

865
01:20:06,886 --> 01:20:08,763
(Screams)

866
01:20:08,888 --> 01:20:11,099
(Screams)

867
01:20:11,224 --> 01:20:14,436
(Man) "Old Red Warm Body Rub
for fun-loving people.

868
01:20:14,561 --> 01:20:16,813
"It gives a slippery sensual effect.

869
01:20:16,938 --> 01:20:19,107
"Works into the skin with rubbing,
providing..."

870
01:20:19,232 --> 01:20:22,485
(Man no. 2) You enjoy reading things like
that, don't you? You really do enjoy it.

871
01:20:22,610 --> 01:20:24,404
(Man no. 1) "it comes in a four-ounce jar..."

872
01:20:24,529 --> 01:20:28,867
What do you mean when you said
that she's not like you?

873
01:20:28,992 --> 01:20:31,119
- What do you mean?
- What are you trying to say? Spit it out.

874
01:20:31,244 --> 01:20:34,789
A few minutes ago,
you said she's...she's not like you.

875
01:20:34,914 --> 01:20:36,333
- What did you mean?
- She's different.

876
01:20:36,458 --> 01:20:38,877
(Nina) OK, she's different.
You said she's different.

877
01:20:39,002 --> 01:20:42,505
She's got a very strange attitude
towards sex, first of all.

878
01:20:42,630 --> 01:20:44,007
She makes a big deal out of it.

879
01:20:44,132 --> 01:20:48,386
Hey, listen, maybe I ought to go over
there and spend a little time with her.

880
01:20:48,511 --> 01:20:51,097
Yeah, maybe you'd better go home
and stop freeloading up here.

881
01:20:51,222 --> 01:20:54,309
Freeloading? You just had one hell
of a meal. Who do you think paid for it?

882
01:20:54,434 --> 01:20:57,145
- Nicky, we haven't had it yet. Relax.
- What's the difference, anyway?

883
01:20:57,270 --> 01:20:59,481
He's gonna get it. He's got an obligation.

884
01:20:59,606 --> 01:21:02,650
- My country's not at war.
- Oh, come on, man. That's shitty.

885
01:21:02,776 --> 01:21:05,528
That is shitty. You apologise to Nick.

886
01:21:06,988 --> 01:21:09,032
Tell him you're sorry.

887
01:21:13,161 --> 01:21:14,579
Tell him you're sorry.

888
01:21:15,747 --> 01:21:19,417
Oh. Now, look that face.
Another eight weeks of not talking.

889
01:21:19,542 --> 01:21:23,213
Hey, where are you going? You
haven't even had your sandwich yet.

890
01:21:23,338 --> 01:21:25,006
- Let him go.
- I'm not gonna let him...

891
01:21:25,131 --> 01:21:28,343
Will you let him go?
I mean, it's not surprising.

892
01:21:28,468 --> 01:21:30,178
(Nina) 'You're always hassling,
the two of you.

893
01:21:30,303 --> 01:21:34,099
'Look, I'm sick of this thing,
this in-between thing.'

894
01:21:37,602 --> 01:21:40,063
(Police sirens wail)

(Lock clicks)

902
01:23:09,027 --> 01:23:12,489
You slept later than usual.
I'm running a bath now.

(Door creaks)

916
01:25:07,895 --> 01:25:12,108
Don't think I can't get out of here.
I can get out any time I want.

917
01:25:14,444 --> 01:25:17,196
And if you think by keeping me here,
I'm gonna get in bed with you,

918
01:25:17,322 --> 01:25:19,866
you're wrong.

919
01:25:19,991 --> 01:25:24,203
If I want a girl or anything,
I'll just go out and get one myself...

920
01:25:26,956 --> 01:25:29,500
...and I might not come back.

I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

925
01:26:36,025 --> 01:26:39,028
I don't want you to be angry with me.

926
01:26:40,071 --> 01:26:42,949
I want you to stay here.

927
01:26:43,074 --> 01:26:45,410
I want things to stay the way they are.

928
01:26:45,535 --> 01:26:48,162
You can understand that, can't you?

929
01:26:49,539 --> 01:26:51,916
I can't let you go.

930
01:26:52,041 --> 01:26:54,001
Not now.

931
01:26:57,755 --> 01:26:59,966

- (Man no. 1) You've got a sister?

- (Man no. 2) She does.
- (Chuckles)

937
01:27:20,903 --> 01:27:22,530
(Man no. 1) Where would you get a sister?

938
01:27:22,655 --> 01:27:24,031
(Man no. 2) I'm serious.

939
01:27:25,283 --> 01:27:27,201
(Low chatter)

940
01:27:31,247 --> 01:27:33,624
(Man no. 1) Eighty stitches.

941
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:36,836
The last time Eunice took
one of her old institution trips,

942
01:27:36,961 --> 01:27:39,380
she stayed out there for three weeks.

943
01:27:43,009 --> 01:27:45,928
(Men murmur)

944
01:27:46,053 --> 01:27:47,221
Yeah?

945
01:27:47,346 --> 01:27:50,183
She's pretty good.

946
01:27:51,350 --> 01:27:52,769
She's sad.

947
01:27:52,894 --> 01:27:55,730
- Well, I went down there...
- Yeah?

948
01:27:55,855 --> 01:27:58,649
Well, you know, she is.

949
01:27:58,775 --> 01:28:00,109
She's...

950
01:28:00,234 --> 01:28:04,113
I tell you, I tell you,
this time she's finished.

951
01:28:04,238 --> 01:28:05,990
Does she try keeping house?

952
01:28:06,115 --> 01:28:07,283
Oh, man.

953
01:28:07,408 --> 01:28:09,494
- She can't work. What can she do?
- Eighty stitches?

954
01:28:09,619 --> 01:28:11,454
- Annie doesn't care.
- Eighty stitches?

955
01:28:11,579 --> 01:28:13,372
Eighty stitches.

956
01:28:13,498 --> 01:28:16,959
- She's...she's a dead chick.
- Mm.

957
01:28:17,084 --> 01:28:19,253
(Toilet flushes)

958
01:28:23,090 --> 01:28:25,051
Excuse me.

959
01:28:32,975 --> 01:28:35,686
Excuse me.
Do you happen to have the time?

960
01:28:35,812 --> 01:28:38,022
No, I'm sorry. My watch is being fixed.

961
01:28:38,147 --> 01:28:40,566
I think it's around 11 o'clock.

962
01:28:42,276 --> 01:28:45,655
- Do you have some blush-on?
- What?

963
01:28:45,780 --> 01:28:49,617
You know, blush-on,
stuff you blush on your cheeks.

964
01:28:49,742 --> 01:28:53,830
- No, I'm sorry. I don't have...
- It's OK.

965
01:28:56,541 --> 01:28:59,710
Are you alone?
I mean, are you meeting anybody?

966
01:28:59,836 --> 01:29:02,255
No one in particular. Why?

967
01:29:02,380 --> 01:29:05,883
Because, then, I have this...l have
a friend, a young friend, a man.

968
01:29:06,008 --> 01:29:10,096
He's staying in my apartment, he can't
get out and I was wondering if you...

969
01:29:10,221 --> 01:29:13,641
- What?
- ...if you would come home with me.

970
01:29:13,766 --> 01:29:18,062
He's very lonely. I was wondering
if you would come home with me.

971
01:29:18,187 --> 01:29:21,732
- You'd pay me?
- Oh, yes, of course I'd pay you.

972
01:29:21,858 --> 01:29:24,610
Oh, wow. You are really something, lady.

973
01:29:24,735 --> 01:29:28,322
You really are something. You've been
following me around, haven't you?

974
01:29:28,447 --> 01:29:31,576
You've been watching me.
You know I'm a working girl, don't you?

975
01:29:31,701 --> 01:29:35,371
Yeah, I'm a working girl, but I'm not a
pervert. So, leave me alone, will you?

976
01:29:35,496 --> 01:29:38,541
Just leave me alone. Find your own
thing, but stay away from me.

977
01:29:43,379 --> 01:29:45,339
(They laugh and chatter)

978
01:29:47,341 --> 01:29:49,760
You know what's going on
in that bathroom?

979
01:29:49,886 --> 01:29:52,221
What?
- There's a chick who's a pervert.

980
01:29:52,346 --> 01:29:54,765
<i>_
_ “h” 'WEN</i>

981
01:29:54,891 --> 01:29:56,517
Something else
you might not understand.

982
01:29:56,642 --> 01:29:58,936
- She want to pay you?
- Yeah.

983
01:29:59,061 --> 01:30:01,814
- It's your sister.
- (They laugh)

984
01:30:01,939 --> 01:30:04,483
Probably wouldn't even make much.

985
01:30:04,609 --> 01:30:06,944
- Have some of it.
- You could take a shot at that.

986
01:30:07,069 --> 01:30:08,821
(Men laugh)

987
01:30:08,946 --> 01:30:11,032
Come on.

988
01:30:11,157 --> 01:30:14,285
Nobody's gonna worry about it.
Oh, that's her, is it?

989
01:30:14,410 --> 01:30:17,997
Try the next one down the block.
It's the best dyke hangout in town.

990
01:30:18,122 --> 01:30:20,249
(They laugh)

991
01:30:22,209 --> 01:30:23,961
The lady needs some help.

992
01:30:24,086 --> 01:30:27,256
Hey, where you going, man?
Where's he going?

993
01:30:27,381 --> 01:30:29,550
Oh, come on. He's such a pig.

994
01:30:29,675 --> 01:30:31,719
(They laugh)

995
01:30:33,054 --> 01:30:35,264
Miss? Lady!

996
01:30:35,389 --> 01:30:37,266
Wait a minute.

997
01:30:38,267 --> 01:30:42,104
- I think I can help you.
- I don't believe so, thank you.

998
01:30:42,229 --> 01:30:43,940
I understand you're looking for a friend?

999
01:30:44,065 --> 01:30:46,108
No, I'm not looking for anyone now.

1000
01:30:46,233 --> 01:30:49,111
Look, I know my way around here
and I just thought I'd help you.

1001
01:30:49,236 --> 01:30:52,657
I suppose you think it's peculiar
or unusual that I should be asking.

1002
01:30:52,782 --> 01:30:56,452
I don't think
anything's peculiar or unusual.

1003
01:30:56,577 --> 01:30:59,497
You see, I have a man friend
who's staying in my apartment

1004
01:30:59,622 --> 01:31:02,583
and he couldn't come out himself
so he sent me.

1005
01:31:02,708 --> 01:31:05,127
How much you think he'll pay?

1006
01:31:05,252 --> 01:31:07,755
I don't know. I'm sorry.
We didn't discuss such a thing.

1007
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:10,633
Whatever you suggest, I expect.

1008
01:31:10,758 --> 01:31:13,302
Things are pretty tight, I think...

1009
01:31:13,427 --> 01:31:16,055
anything safe'd probably cost him
30, 35 dollars.

1010
01:31:16,180 --> 01:31:19,225
Yes, well, I'm sure that he would be
willing to pay that. I'm quite sure.

1011
01:31:19,350 --> 01:31:22,103
I know a couple of places. Let's try 'em.

1012
01:31:34,448 --> 01:31:37,034
(Woman) Ducky, don't be mad at me.

1013
01:31:37,159 --> 01:31:41,706
(Ducky) Why shouldn't I be? You were out
all night again, till five this morning.

1014
01:31:41,831 --> 01:31:43,749
(Woman)
Well, I had to go and see my sister.

1015
01:31:43,874 --> 01:31:45,626
(Ducky) Oh, come on.

1016
01:31:45,751 --> 01:31:48,254
Why don't you just sit down here
and I'll work this out?

1017
01:31:48,379 --> 01:31:50,256
All right.

1018
01:31:50,381 --> 01:31:52,925
(Women murmur)

1019
01:31:53,884 --> 01:31:56,345
- My name's Burt.
- I know. What do you want?

1020
01:31:56,470 --> 01:31:59,348
I want to get a companion for her.

1021
01:31:59,473 --> 01:32:00,766
(Ducky)
Your sister has a phone, doesn't she?

1022
01:32:00,891 --> 01:32:01,892
Yes.

1023
01:32:02,018 --> 01:32:04,186
Why the hell didn't you use it?
That's what I want to know.

1024
01:32:04,311 --> 01:32:06,355
Why the hell didn't you use it?

1025
01:32:07,690 --> 01:32:09,942
- What's your name, lady?
- I'm sorry?

1026
01:32:10,067 --> 01:32:12,445
- She gotta be nice, man. Pretty.
- How much will you pay?

1027
01:32:13,738 --> 01:32:17,199
Well, the gentleman said, er...30, 35.

1028
01:32:17,324 --> 01:32:20,161
50. 50 minimum for what you want.

1029
01:32:20,286 --> 01:32:23,956
- OK, we want to see her first.
- Go and get Sylvia.

1030
01:32:24,081 --> 01:32:27,293
AI, get the lady a coffee
while she's waiting.

1031
01:32:28,127 --> 01:32:30,755
No one in here's better than her.

1032
01:32:33,841 --> 01:32:36,260
(Ducky) I just want to know one thing...

1033
01:32:36,385 --> 01:32:39,889
What was he like?
That's all I want to know.

1034
01:32:40,014 --> 01:32:41,974
- (Woman) The young man was nice.
- Mm.

1035
01:32:42,099 --> 01:32:44,060
(Women murmur)

1036
01:32:47,438 --> 01:32:48,939
Madam, could I interest you
in a pamphlet?

1037
01:32:49,065 --> 01:32:52,485
The word of the Lord is written in here.
Read these two paragraphs.

1038
01:32:52,610 --> 01:32:54,278
You, sir, are a penitent.

1039
01:32:54,403 --> 01:32:56,614
Read the word of the Lord
as written in there. Bless you.

1040
01:32:56,739 --> 01:32:57,823
Right.

1041
01:32:57,948 --> 01:33:00,284
Aren't you beautiful?

1042
01:33:00,409 --> 01:33:03,204
Could I interrupt you for a moment
and offer you this pamphlet?

1043
01:33:03,329 --> 01:33:05,998
The true word of the Lord
is here revealed.

1044
01:33:06,123 --> 01:33:09,752
You shall find inner salvation and
happiness, if you read these few words...

1045
01:33:09,877 --> 01:33:11,670
(Ducky) Will you get the hell out of here?

1046
01:33:11,796 --> 01:33:14,840
Madam, you do not say,
"Get the hell out of here," to the Lord.

1047
01:33:14,965 --> 01:33:17,551
Knock it off and get the hell out of here!

1048
01:33:18,427 --> 01:33:21,847
Bless you, ladies.
The Lord will forgive you.

1049
01:33:24,016 --> 01:33:25,059
Over here.

1050
01:33:31,190 --> 01:33:33,192
This lady here wants you.

1051
01:33:33,317 --> 01:33:35,569
It's not for me. You understand?

1052
01:33:35,694 --> 01:33:37,446
- Where?
- It's at her place.

1053
01:33:37,571 --> 01:33:41,367
(Ducky's friend)
I didn't think about your needs...

1054
01:33:41,492 --> 01:33:42,827
OK.

1055
01:33:42,952 --> 01:33:44,370
OK?

1056
01:33:44,495 --> 01:33:46,413
You have to pay him now.

1057
01:33:46,539 --> 01:33:48,958
(Whispers) Oh, I'm sorry.

1058
01:33:51,418 --> 01:33:53,921
(Other women murmur)

1059
01:33:59,009 --> 01:34:02,138
(Ducky) I want to know one thing.
I want to know what...

1060
01:34:06,016 --> 01:34:10,479
Hey, lady. You got to pay
for your coffee. Fifteen cents.

1061
01:34:17,111 --> 01:34:20,030
- (Ducky) Can I choose where we go?
- (Friend) Yeah.

1062
01:34:23,284 --> 01:34:25,536
(indistinct)

1063
01:34:34,044 --> 01:34:36,130
(Meter clicks)

1064
01:34:43,679 --> 01:34:46,182
(Meter clicks)

1065
01:34:57,401 --> 01:34:59,236
(Meter clicks)

1066
01:35:03,449 --> 01:35:05,451
(Lock clicks)

1067
01:36:13,644 --> 01:36:15,229
(Door shuts)

1068
01:36:35,416 --> 01:36:37,418
(Lock rattles)

1069
01:36:49,263 --> 01:36:50,723
Would you come with me, please?

1070
01:36:55,102 --> 01:36:57,021
(Whispers) Please.

1071
01:37:41,065 --> 01:37:43,400
I'm sorry. I don't know your name.

1072
01:37:45,152 --> 01:37:46,236
Sylvia.

1073
01:37:46,362 --> 01:37:48,322
Yes, er...

1074
01:37:50,366 --> 01:37:52,451
...this is the boy that I told you about.

1075
01:38:08,175 --> 01:38:10,344
(Door rattles)

1076
01:38:11,512 --> 01:38:13,972
Oh, what? Are we locked in here?

1077
01:38:14,098 --> 01:38:17,518
Yeah, she's pretty handy
with the old key.

1078
01:38:19,561 --> 01:38:22,606
Am I supposed to be for her or for you?

1079
01:38:23,607 --> 01:38:25,609
Did she pay you?

1080
01:38:27,569 --> 01:38:28,904
Yeah.

1081
01:38:29,029 --> 01:38:31,156
How much?

1082
01:38:33,075 --> 01:38:34,660
20 bucks.

1083
01:38:34,785 --> 01:38:36,620
That's very generous.

1084
01:38:36,745 --> 01:38:39,373
I mean to me, not to you.

1085
01:38:40,874 --> 01:38:42,584
Oh.

1086
01:38:43,502 --> 01:38:45,212
Mm-hm.

1087
01:38:48,632 --> 01:38:50,551
Hm.

1088
01:38:51,802 --> 01:38:53,095
(Springs creak)

1089
01:38:53,220 --> 01:38:55,597
What is she? One of them voyeurs?

1090
01:38:55,722 --> 01:38:59,643
She looking through a little hole
somewhere around here?

1091
01:38:59,768 --> 01:39:01,687
- Are you looking at us, lady?!
- No, no, no, no.

1092
01:39:01,812 --> 01:39:05,607
She's...she's just a little mixed up,
that's all.

1093
01:39:07,526 --> 01:39:11,488
Yeah, well, I don't dig
those freak scenes, anyway.

1094
01:39:14,324 --> 01:39:16,243
But you look OK.

1095
01:39:16,368 --> 01:39:19,037
- (Laughs)
- Take it easy, all right?

1096
01:39:19,163 --> 01:39:21,874
- Oh! Take your sweater off.
- OK. All right, all right!

1097
01:39:21,999 --> 01:39:24,918
- Ha-ha!
- All right. Hold on for just a minute.

1098
01:39:25,043 --> 01:39:27,463
Wait. Listen, listen.
Let me go to the bathroom.

1099
01:39:27,588 --> 01:39:30,048
Hold on one sec. Hold on.

1100
01:39:51,528 --> 01:39:54,865
- There, that's right.
- All right.

1101
01:39:54,990 --> 01:39:56,992
OK, just hold on one second.

1102
01:39:57,117 --> 01:40:01,079
She's sure as hell not paying you
by the hour, is she?

1103
01:40:01,205 --> 01:40:02,956
(She moans)

1104
01:40:03,081 --> 01:40:04,666
Mm-hm.

1105
01:40:08,504 --> 01:40:11,089
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. Nothing's the matter.

1106
01:40:11,215 --> 01:40:14,426
- Nothing, that's right.
- It was something.

1107
01:40:14,551 --> 01:40:16,595
- Look, just...
- You're not concentrating.

1108
01:40:16,720 --> 01:40:19,431
Look, do you have to talk so much?

1109
01:40:20,933 --> 01:40:24,811
What is it? It's that freaky lady, right?
She's got you all upset.

1110
01:40:24,937 --> 01:40:27,689
Now...

1111
01:40:27,814 --> 01:40:29,233
Mm.

1112
01:40:29,358 --> 01:40:33,111
What are you...what are you
doing here with her?

1113
01:40:33,237 --> 01:40:37,115
Well, she's got me locked in,
for one thing.

1114
01:40:38,116 --> 01:40:39,993
You mean she's got you here
against your wishes?

1115
01:40:40,118 --> 01:40:43,872
If we're gonna carry on a conversation,
why don't we get up and get dressed?

1116
01:40:43,997 --> 01:40:45,999
Oh, mm.

1117
01:40:47,084 --> 01:40:49,044
Don't you like Sylvia?

1118
01:41:45,726 --> 01:41:49,021
- (Boy and Sylvia murmur)
- (Clock ticks)

1119
01:41:50,647 --> 01:41:53,483
(The boy) Go on!

1120
01:41:53,609 --> 01:41:58,071
(Sylvia) Cause when I get out of here,
you're coming right home with me.

1121
01:41:58,196 --> 01:42:01,158
OK? You've got to come with me.

1122
01:42:01,283 --> 01:42:03,785
- (Boy) Huh?
- (Sylvia) You've got to come with me.

1123
01:42:03,910 --> 01:42:06,997
- (Boy) Well, I don't know.
- (Sylvia) Well, I don't know(!)

1124
01:42:07,122 --> 01:42:09,166
- (Boy) We'll see. We'll see, all right?
- (Sylvia) Mm, mm, mm!

1125
01:42:09,291 --> 01:42:13,462
(Boy) Just hold on now
for one second, please.

1126
01:42:13,587 --> 01:42:15,756
- (Sylvia) Don't you...
- (Boy) All right.

1127
01:42:15,881 --> 01:42:17,591
(Sylvia laughs)

1128
01:42:17,716 --> 01:42:19,843
Oh. Oh.

1129
01:42:19,968 --> 01:42:23,347
- (Sylvia) Let me get a little feel.
- (Boy) All right.

1130
01:42:25,390 --> 01:42:27,601
Don't you like Sylvie?

1131
01:42:28,935 --> 01:42:29,936
(Clock ticks)

1132
01:42:30,062 --> 01:42:32,439
(Grunts)

1133
01:42:32,564 --> 01:42:35,067
(Sylvia murmurs)

1134
01:42:35,192 --> 01:42:38,195
<i>'</i> (Boy) Huh?
- (Sylvia) Oh.

1135
01:42:39,696 --> 01:42:41,865
(Sylvia) Now just you relax.

1136
01:42:41,990 --> 01:42:44,409
(Clock ticks)

1137
01:42:44,534 --> 01:42:47,120
(Sylvia) Don't be a little baby.

1138
01:42:47,245 --> 01:42:50,040
(Sylvia murmurs and laughs)

1139
01:42:52,167 --> 01:42:54,336
(Sylvia moans)

1140
01:42:54,461 --> 01:42:57,089
(They breathe hard)

1141
01:42:59,007 --> 01:43:01,802
(Sylvia moans)

1142
01:43:05,806 --> 01:43:09,476
- (Sylvia cries out)
- (Boy) What are you doing?

1143
01:43:09,601 --> 01:43:11,353
Stop it! Stop it!

1144
01:43:11,478 --> 01:43:14,064
(Sylvia cries out)

1145
01:43:14,189 --> 01:43:17,067
(Sylvia cries out)

1146
01:43:17,192 --> 01:43:19,569
(Cries out)

1147
01:43:22,280 --> 01:43:24,991
(Cries out)

1148
01:43:25,117 --> 01:43:27,202
(Cries out)

1149
01:43:27,327 --> 01:43:29,371
(Shrieks)

1150
01:45:06,551 --> 01:45:08,512
Oh.

1151
01:45:11,264 --> 01:45:13,475
Were you frightened?

1152
01:45:14,768 --> 01:45:17,312
You don't have to be frightened now.

1153
01:45:17,437 --> 01:45:19,856
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1154
01:45:19,981 --> 01:45:22,359
There's no need to be frightened now.

1155
01:45:23,485 --> 01:45:28,532
Now, I've told her to go. I've told
that girl to get her things and go now.

1156
01:45:28,657 --> 01:45:31,201
There's no need for you
to be afraid now, you see.

1157
01:45:31,326 --> 01:45:35,831
I told her that you didn't like her
and that she should go.

1158
01:45:35,956 --> 01:45:40,085
And I said, "He doesn't like you

1159
01:45:41,586 --> 01:45:43,463
"and you should go."

1160
01:45:43,588 --> 01:45:47,008
Don't be afraid. Oh, please.

1161
01:45:47,133 --> 01:45:51,388
And you can stay with me now.
You don't have to be afraid. All right?

1162
01:45:52,639 --> 01:45:57,686
You can stay. There's no need to be
afraid now. You can stay with me.

1163
01:46:00,605 --> 01:46:02,941
All right.

1164
01:46:09,364 --> 01:46:11,992
I want you to make love to me.

1165
01:46:13,952 --> 01:46:15,704
Please.

1166
01:46:17,747 --> 01:46:19,583
Please.

1167
01:46:22,919 --> 01:46:25,255
Please, stay with me.

1168
01:46:28,300 --> 01:46:30,302
Mm.

1169
01:46:30,427 --> 01:46:33,263
I want you to make love to me.

1170
01:46:38,852 --> 01:46:40,812
Please.

1171
01:46:42,772 --> 01:46:44,691
Please.
