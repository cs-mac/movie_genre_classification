1
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,870
Do your prayer my brother.

2
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,360
Said that Allah is the only god that
exists.

3
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,830
And is the largest.

4
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,950
Expensive present!

5
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,630
Since April 2003, the Kurdistan is
free.

6
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,780
Saddam Hussein has left a country in
ruins.

7
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,430
We must rebuild this country.

8
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,310
Establish strong institutions.

9
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,510
Police and army.

10
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,350
To protect our people.

11
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,460
There is no justice without
security.

12
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,950
And there is neither justice nor
security without punishment.

13
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,120
Sir.

14
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,070
Mr. Doctor.

15
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,030
Mr. Estimated mullah.

16
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,750
Today I feel honored.

17
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,670
For the first time in Kurdish
history.

18
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,630
In our democracy.

19
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,830
We will apply the death penalty.

20
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,760
The culprit.

21
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,750
Anwar ahmed gefur.

22
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,310
Committed murder and rape.

23
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,880
He will be hanged.

24
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,670
- Sir we do how?
- You have not prepared anything?

25
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,560
- Prepared what?
- The rope of the gallows!

26
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,310
Oh yes the string.

27
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,960
Idiot!

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,830
Do not kill me I am innocent.

29
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,190
That's illegal.
We must stop it.

30
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,230
He is not dead.
The law says?

31
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,470
The law is formally.
He must be hanged.

32
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,390
Not twice.
Condemn the imprisonment.

33
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,590
Has not yet been in prison he has to
die.

34
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,350
Then pull a bullet in the neck.

35
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,350
Not hanging is the only way.

36
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,430
I have a solution: the condemned is
small.

37
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,990
If I cling to him he will die soon.

38
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,670
So what do we do?

39
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,830
Blessing fell.

40
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,590
Hanging did not tell you like it?

41
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,710
I understand you.

42
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,750
But it should be out of this
situation.

43
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,910
I am a fighter not a cop.

44
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,430
The war is over Saddam fell.

45
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,510
Kurds are free.
I resign.

46
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,080
We need you now.

47
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,310
I did my work.
I leave you the honors.

48
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,350
Now I go home.

49
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,310
This country needs laws to security
and stability.

50
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,280
Otherwise we will lose everything we
have undertaken.

51
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,350
Does not become resistant cop.

52
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,670
You're too idealistic baran.

53
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,030
Our situation has improved.
It has all.

54
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,070
We sleep on oil.

55
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,870
No misses your luck.

56
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,670
Was not the concept of luck I think.

57
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,230
Well give me your gun.

58
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,830
The weapon it is mine.

59
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,680
Mom!

60
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,950
- My son missed you.
- You too.

61
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,520
Will shelter us.

62
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,870
My daughter I said no.

63
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,030
You do not go back to this village.

64
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,510
I work with children.

65
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,990
I sleep in the school.

66
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,990
You do not have to worry.

67
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,880
Enough Govend!
The father said no.

68
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,710
You will not go back.

69
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,750
Working one does not need your
salary.

70
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,270
If I had married taqiyeddine.

71
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,740
We would not be here.

72
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,430
I'm not made for taqiyeddine.

73
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,750
But you're a girl my daughter.

74
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,550
Well you trust my brothers?

75
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,800
Yes.

76
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,400
And your daughter?

77
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,430
I trust you too.

78
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,470
How you doin?

79
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,590
How you find my son?

80
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,230
It has the serious air.

81
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,240
It looks good.

82
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,990
It is beautiful.

83
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,910
Baran you came back to marry you and
we caches!

84
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,030
Kader what's this marriage thing
where you leave it?

85
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,110
Just in the garden my son I need
you.

86
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,790
Leave me alone mom.

87
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,230
Come see my son.

88
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,110
I decided to take the service.

89
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,950
This time.

90
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,870
You will work with me.

91
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,360
No.

92
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,230
Send me where you need me.

93
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,070
Very well.

94
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,070
Then I will send you there.

95
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,230
Qamarian.

96
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,230
A brand new police station waiting
for you.

97
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:34,030
I can not go farther.
The Turkish army destroyed the
bridge.

98
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,070
How I'm going to qamarian?

99
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,510
2 hours walk.

100
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,310
The bridge is destroyed continue
riding.

101
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,630
You're baran?

102
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,550
- And reber you?
- Yes it's me your assistant.

103
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,350
You were punished?

104
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,430
Nobody wants to come here.

105
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,060
It's my choice.

106
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:06,070
In town there's oil business money.

107
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,430
Why come here?

108
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,030
I fly my mother.

109
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:16,320
I can not leave the country rotten.

110
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,750
What were you doing before?

111
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,110
Fighter.
Since the age of fifteen years.

112
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,630
In our village there is nothing
going.

113
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,390
There is already something.

114
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,070
One makes smuggling here?

115
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,870
Here is the Bermuda Triangle.

116
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,580
Our Kurdish Iraq make alcohol
traffic.

117
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,550
With iran.

118
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,470
Our turkey Kurds are supplied with
weapons by.

119
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,120
Is Turkish planes?

120
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,110
They seek resistant.

121
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,710
It is the teacher.

122
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,550
I can not let you walk.

123
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,910
I'm used to walk.

124
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,750
Ride with me.

125
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,740
My name Govend.

126
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Baran.

127
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,710
What do you qamarian?

128
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,590
I'm the new commander.

129
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,640
Thank you.

130
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,070
I prefer staying here.

131
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:39,590
Thank you.

132
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,110
A woman with two men people will
talk.

133
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,790
Thank you.

134
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,350
It is still in the works but you
have a nice place.

135
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,920
Between I beg.

136
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,120
There are only two telephones in the
village.

137
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,550
A in here the other restaurant.

138
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,520
The villagers come here to call.

139
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,270
You're forced to listen to their
stories of love.

140
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,710
Hens and roosters.

141
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,070
Is boring.

142
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,470
But sometimes it can be used.

143
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,150
All these people are your photo
predecessors.

144
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,030
It is always the same photographer?

145
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,670
Yes.
What for?

146
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,790
Good evening.

147
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,630
- M.
Zirek!

148
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,950
Good evening.

149
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,430
We changed the lock.

150
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,790
I know they did when I was not
there.

151
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,550
- You do not have the new key?
- I'll see.

152
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,790
If you come stay with us.

153
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,150
Home?

154
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,550
Or at the inn.

155
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,880
It often cuts?

156
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,080
Electricity?

157
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,360
God only knows.

158
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,670
There are also two rooms with a
small prison.

159
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,550
This is the last commander of the
rifle.

160
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,350
That was the previous.

161
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,390
Cursed be your electricity!

162
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,750
Good evening.

163
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,720
You are welcome!

164
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,040
Thank you.

165
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,910
Alcohol?
I have very good alcohol.

166
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,750
For the night two or three bottles?

167
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,030
Since the death of simko.

168
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,670
It was not heated in you.

169
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,600
Good evening.

170
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,320
Good evening.

171
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,840
M. Saman.

172
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,830
I do not have the keys you do not
have a room?

173
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,750
There is a room?

174
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,080
No.

175
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,470
No I have no room.

176
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,400
I see.

177
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,750
They do not want a teacher.

178
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,470
It's school or the only woman they
do not want?

179
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,390
Since when you work here?

180
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,430
Three months.

181
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,550
Your family thinks what?

182
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,190
They are not all in agreement.

183
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,430
I respect what my father.

184
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,510
And he agreed?

185
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,880
Yes.

186
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,670
It is surely a good person.

187
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,040
Thank you.

188
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,160
Thank you.

189
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,880
Hello.

190
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,110
It's you again?

191
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,870
The new commander.

192
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,230
Aziz aga send me.
You are his guest tonight.

193
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,580
I do not know.

194
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,230
Is the lord of the region.

195
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:58,390
It invites every newcomer in the
evening of his arrival.

196
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:03,880
An invitation that does not refuse
reber is not it?

197
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,640
Then agree.

198
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,830
But for lunch.

199
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,510
You know what you're doing?

200
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,750
I'm going too fast?

201
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,150
Baran it would be a shame.

202
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,350
We do not have time to take at least
your photo.

203
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:39,110
Aziz has many ways.
It is very powerful.

204
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:46,950
Govend!

205
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,630
I have not had time to look for the
key.

206
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:53,150
When I got home the little had
fever.

207
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,920
He is better now?

208
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,670
He is better thank you.

209
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,430
Which changed the school's lock?

210
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,760
What?

211
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,560
It is you who have changed the lock
or is aziz aga?

212
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,520
I do not know Govend.

213
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,550
Do not you know?

214
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,360
We did not know you'd come back.

215
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,680
I came back.

216
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,870
In a few months you will be
transferred.

217
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,790
But I still.

218
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,070
And I have to feed my family.

219
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,910
You can accommodate children?

220
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,560
Sit!

221
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,800
Hello.

222
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,030
Where is my heater?

223
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,080
Not breathing.

224
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,030
That was very well.

225
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,720
Super.

226
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,880
It was very well.

227
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,760
Welcome baran.

228
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,240
Aziz thank you aga.

229
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,040
Welcome.

230
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,320
Enter.

231
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,480
Baran.

232
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,960
You're in front of bradost.

233
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,230
This mountain has always protected
us.

234
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:08,720
Turkish Persians and Arabs failed to
come here.

235
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,070
Aziz aga I am delighted to hear
that.

236
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,750
If there is corruption in the region
and.

237
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,070
Unworthy or compromise.

238
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,960
Or influence of foreign forces.

239
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,990
You can be proud of.

240
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,350
Baran I know who you are.

241
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,870
The liberation war is one thing.

242
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:46,190
Maintain peace and security is
something else.

243
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,790
You're aware of the fate of your
predecessor?

244
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,870
Poor simko.

245
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,230
He has been brutally murdered.

246
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,830
Stubborn he lost everything.

247
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,910
But do not worry.

248
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,200
I offer you my protection.

249
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,310
Times change.
Today authority is Kurdish.

250
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,710
Laws should apply everywhere.

251
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,310
It is I who must enforce.

252
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,030
And it is to me to protect you aziz
aga.

253
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Baran.

254
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,350
My family rules over these mountains
for years.

255
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,230
I know everyone.

256
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:34,510
Old young children.

257
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,470
Rather repair the bridge of the
village.

258
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,950
It is not the mission entrusted to
me that.

259
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,990
But I'm glad you hope modernize the
country.

260
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,470
Time will make you understand.

261
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,710
I'm the new commander of the region.

262
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,830
From now.

263
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,110
I will ensure law enforcement.

264
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,390
There are laws written.

265
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,550
And there are ancestral laws.

266
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,360
The fact.

267
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,030
I heard noises.

268
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,630
Your first night seems to have been
nice.

269
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,960
And though.

270
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,870
It does not concern you.

271
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,830
During the war that was aga?

272
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,510
He sometimes help our resistant.

273
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,510
By contacting the Turkish and
Iranian.

274
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,350
It was collabo?

275
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:56,310
Quite often found where you least
expect.

276
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,790
Here the war is not over.

277
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,470
We are not at peace here?

278
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,470
I go go.

279
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,940
Good evening!

280
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,110
What's going on?

281
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,590
One of our comrades was wounded.

282
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,070
He needs medication.

283
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:24,390
You can go and see if there is such
drugs at the inn?

284
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,110
And some food also.

285
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,910
What are you doing in these
mountains?

286
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,120
Rice.

287
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,910
Rice lenses.

288
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,870
And drugs?

289
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,270
- Penicillin?
- Antibiotics?

290
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,600
Hello!

291
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,710
Welcome Tajdin.

292
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,040
What do you want?

293
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,240
We will have fun.

294
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,920
Not touch me!

295
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,520
Bastard!

296
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,030
You hurt me.

297
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:14,870
Let me go!

298
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,200
Loose it!

299
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,200
Pull over!

300
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,280
Enough!

301
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,240
Shame on you!

302
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,480
Sluts!

303
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,880
Kind of whores.

304
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,720
I'll kill you.

305
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,030
These trails have nothing to do
here.

306
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,710
They must go.

307
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,910
I'll take care Tajdin.

308
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,910
It's me who'll take care.

309
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:45,870
We must rid the area of these
parasites.

310
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,110
You understand?

311
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,870
I'll tell you one thing.

312
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,390
I'll take them to the police.

313
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,500
Name commander!

314
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,550
I take them to aziz aga.

315
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,710
He will know how to take care.

316
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,200
Tajdin!

317
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,990
The law that's me!

318
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,670
You understand?

319
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,470
It will not always be there to
protect you.

320
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,990
What are you doing here?

321
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,710
We need medicine.

322
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,820
Turkish destroyed the bridge because
of you.

323
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,870
Now.

324
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,630
We can move on foot or on horseback.

325
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,870
You are fighting against the Turks
go to Turkey.

326
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,870
It has helped you against Saddam.

327
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,200
Enough!

328
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,590
One is that either Kurdish Turkey
and Iraq.

329
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,030
You're on their side?

330
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,150
Politically non.

331
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,230
Yes but morally.

332
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,150
I do not agree with the armed
struggle.

333
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,750
But I understand.

334
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,280
When you are in Turkey and Kurdish
woman.

335
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,150
The bush is freedom.

336
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,950
We can leave?

337
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,870
What medications you need?

338
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,300
Hello mistress.

339
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,390
You've seen before?

340
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,240
Six times nine?

341
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,470
Six times three?

342
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,270
Do not you know?

343
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,750
And one plus one?

344
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,840
One plus one does it make?

345
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,160
Say something.

346
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,750
Even if you do not know.

347
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:39,950
Ten.

348
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,280
- How much?
- Ten.

349
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,560
Ten?

350
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,270
Mizgin him and how much is it?

351
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,750
I know mistress.

352
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,310
But my mother more than my father
ten children are.

353
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,350
Was that fake drugs here.

354
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,720
Look.

355
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,830
Is flour.

356
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,030
Mr. Approach.

357
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,110
For $ 40 I give you the good.

358
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,390
Your university.

359
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,110
Should teach you morality too.

360
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,480
Medications!

361
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,950
You missed the opportunity to get
down!

362
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:17,710
You do not have things to say to my
lord?

363
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,950
I can not be a teacher and caretaker
manager.

364
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,550
I need it.

365
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,310
But thou hast hid me which housed
the turkey Kurdish home.

366
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,230
And its relationship with the
commander.

367
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,270
All that you knew zirek.

368
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,910
Nevertheless it is a good teacher.

369
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,270
Children learn best with it.

370
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,350
That's the most important.

371
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,510
Zirek rids us of her.

372
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,550
It is the administration that
decides not me.

373
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,910
Your son is still sick?

374
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,830
I could send abroad.

375
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,670
He will be treated in the best
hospitals.

376
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,470
Hear?

377
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,800
Yes.

378
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:13,350
She prostitute well with the
commander?

379
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,310
I want the address of his family.

380
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,240
Hello.

381
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,070
Hello.

382
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,430
Silence.

383
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,000
I'll do the class.

384
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,320
What?

385
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,910
I'll do the class.
You can leave you free.

386
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,150
There is a problem?

387
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,430
No.

388
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,750
You can go.
I do the class.

389
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,080
Govend.

390
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,390
I do not understand.

391
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,470
I go and you make the class?

392
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,800
Yes.

393
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,990
- I'm leaving and you make the
class?
- Yes.

394
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,510
C'mon do the class.

395
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,520
C'mon begins.

396
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,910
I want to talk to aziz aga.

397
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,430
It is not.

398
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,310
I want to talk to aziz aga.

399
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,070
You mean him?

400
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:56,630
I will never leave this school.

401
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,160
Say it to him.

402
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:02,750
I'll stay.

403
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,320
Say it to him.

404
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,040
Hello.

405
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:27,800
Agreed.

406
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,550
Back in a few minutes.

407
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,720
Thank you.

408
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:48,920
Govend!

409
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:03,680
Hello.

410
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,240
Hello.

411
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,200
Phone for you.

412
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,150
Dad what happens?

413
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,190
What you mean daddy?

414
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:55,950
Who told you that?

415
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:44,600
Reber come see.

416
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,750
You think they are smugglers?

417
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:51,470
It is men aziz aga.
Will know what they traffic.

418
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,510
There are too many.

419
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:55,360
We go.

420
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,750
It's our job.

421
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:11,270
Pull over!

422
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,630
Advance!

423
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:21,950
Stand still!

424
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,550
What are you a merchant?

425
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:37,910
Nothing.

426
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,790
It's a little soap and sugar.

427
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:44,950
Medications or drugs?

428
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,590
We need these drugs.

429
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:54,080
They are out of date?

430
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:57,230
I do not touch that.

431
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:04,150
I did not check the dates of
medications.

432
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:08,160
Handcuff him.

433
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:33,750
What do you want?

434
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,720
A cigarette please.

435
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:37,590
I dream of a cigarette.

436
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:41,390
Shut up and be quiet.

437
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:49,950
Opens the door.

438
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:59,670
I want to smoke and going to the
toilet.

439
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:02,950
Cigarette or toilet?

440
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:06,240
Cigarette.

441
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:15,790
This is not finished?

442
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,350
Stand still!

443
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,710
Baran why you stopped?

444
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,790
His file is empty.

445
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:05,030
He sold expired drugs.

446
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:06,630
You have evidence?

447
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,630
They have them removed.
Robert and I are witnesses.

448
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,550
Sir they sell expired medicines.

449
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,280
To poor people who die.

450
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:29,630
You tortured.

451
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,150
And have him extract confessions.

452
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:34,550
He could not defend himself.

453
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:37,790
Jaffar mohamed emin is that you?

454
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:39,500
Yes sir.

455
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,870
Do you recognize these accusations?

456
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:43,920
No.

457
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:49,070
We have families on the other side
of the border.

458
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:51,550
Sometimes we exchange.

459
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,320
Food.

460
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,910
You also have a witness?

461
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:05,030
My lord the respected aziz aga.

462
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:08,710
Attests to the honesty of his friend
Mohammed Emin jaffar.

463
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,750
His uprightness of his good faith.

464
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:14,030
And loyalty to our country.

465
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:19,270
Jaffar mohamed emin.

466
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,080
You are free.

467
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:22,750
Release it!

468
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:36,720
It's a shame.

469
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:42,430
Not now jafar.

470
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:43,760
Commander.

471
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,620
I talk to you?

472
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:03,000
You should not attack you aziz aga.

473
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,830
About your morals dating is sacred
here.

474
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:08,160
Morality?

475
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,430
It's good you can go reber.

476
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,870
They are dangerous, you know.
You want me to stay?

477
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,590
No thank you.

478
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:36,150
If your tribe asks you to kill me.

479
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:37,870
You kill me?

480
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:40,720
Fuck off!

481
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:01,430
Here is the police.

482
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:03,720
Govend?

483
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,400
And who are you?

484
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:09,790
Taqiyeddine.

485
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:54,840
Zirek?

486
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:58,390
Zirek is that you?

487
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:02,440
Who's there?

488
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:05,560
Zirek?

489
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:46,990
I heard the noise.

490
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:48,680
Who's there?

491
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,430
It's a school here or?

492
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:01,830
You finish your sentence and you're
dead.
What do you want?

493
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:04,910
We saw the light when we entered.

494
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:07,150
And here.

495
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,230
It was expected that.

496
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,390
Shame on you.

497
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:13,070
Go home Tajdin.

498
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,550
You do not scare me commander.

499
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:17,590
You do not scare anyone here.

500
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:23,030
My brother I do not want to kill
Kurdish.

501
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:28,110
You must respect the school and the
teacher.

502
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:30,430
It is there for your kids.

503
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,390
Rather it is there for you.

504
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:40,400
Stop!

505
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:47,310
Make us our weapons.
The mountain is dangerous.

506
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:48,640
We want our weapons.

507
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:50,400
If you cross a jackal negotiate.

508
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:54,110
Our weapons is our honor Commander.

509
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:55,870
Make us weapons.

510
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,350
You have no honor.

511
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:00,350
Get thee Tajdin.

512
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:01,680
Get the fuck camp.

513
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,110
You will regret commander.

514
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:25,480
Thank you.

515
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,070
Is brave for taking on this post.

516
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:37,470
Nobody wanted this village.

517
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:42,190
While children here need education.

518
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:45,070
I like it here.

519
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:48,070
I also love your children.

520
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:52,240
You do not have you?

521
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:54,560
No.

522
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:59,190
I have made up my studying
twenty-six.

523
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:03,430
For the people here I am very old
now.

524
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:06,600
How old are you?

525
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:09,390
Twenty-eight years.

526
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:14,430
Here if you're not married at my
age.

527
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:17,110
People think you have a problem.

528
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:25,710
Is that taqiyeddine?

529
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:26,590
What?

530
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:28,320
Is that taqiyeddine?

531
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:30,880
What for?

532
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:33,380
He called.

533
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:37,190
It's nothing.

534
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:39,880
He's an idiot.

535
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,270
You like music?

536
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:54,920
What for?

537
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:56,760
Like that.

538
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:00,600
Why you ask?

539
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:04,340
For nothing like that.

540
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:11,280
Yes.

541
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:13,560
Really?

542
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:16,150
What do you listen to?

543
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,470
Elvis Presley.

544
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:22,350
Jean Sebastian Bach.

545
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:23,750
Mozart.

546
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:26,230
There are many other.

547
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,150
Will not you sing?

548
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:30,480
Right now?

549
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:41,190
<i>When you go away from me.</i>

550
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:44,990
<i>The moon darkens.</i>

551
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:48,510
<i>Your beautiful face your neck thy
mouth.</i>

552
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:52,150
<i>Become for me the veil of night.</i>

553
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:55,440
<i>Your beautiful face your neck thy
mouth.</i>

554
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:59,070
<i>Become for me the veil of night.</i>

555
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:04,640
<i>You're my end hoofed my end.</i>

556
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:10,750
<i>You're my end hoofed my end.</i>

557
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:13,400
Here.

558
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:15,510
- Great picture!
- It shows.

559
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:18,950
It's not much but it's good.
Thank you!

560
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:20,680
Was the visit.

561
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:25,100
Welcome aziz aga.

562
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:29,350
I want to see the commander.

563
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:30,720
Without your men.

564
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:36,840
Last night it is a serious mistake.

565
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,230
I understand you do not know all of
us.

566
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:43,630
Guns do not count as.

567
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,030
But disarm a man.

568
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:47,820
It is an insult.

569
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:51,160
Weapons in schools is prohibited.

570
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:56,550
I love you very baran.
I like the stubborn men.

571
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:01,590
Then content yourself touching your
salary.

572
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:04,310
And do not meddle with the rest.

573
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:07,750
There is a problem?

574
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,190
It is said that you and the teacher.

575
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:12,920
You became friends.

576
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:14,910
A rather special friendship.

577
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:24,190
It does not concern you aziz aga.

578
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,150
You still do not understand baran.

579
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:31,270
Home the honor.

580
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:33,470
Matters.

581
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:36,790
I do not know which side you were
during the war aziz aga.

582
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:40,870
But I'm not sure we have the same
sense of honor.

583
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:01,270
Thus please.

584
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:22,460
You lack.

585
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:24,550
Cold blood.

586
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:26,030
Yes that's right.

587
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:28,470
I hope you know what you're doing.

588
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:34,270
If it is to prove your might aziz
aga not wrong.

589
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:35,920
You must be crazy!

590
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:52,760
Tajdin.

591
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:56,190
The real problem is baran.

592
01:01:58,160 --> 01:01:59,640
Must neutralize.

593
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:34,190
Abdullah how are you?

594
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:36,030
It's okay?

595
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:38,870
It will be a particular course.

596
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:40,520
Abdullah!

597
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:43,880
Are you okay?

598
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:45,670
You were not going to school.

599
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,070
You should go.
People do not like me here.

600
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:49,550
Go away!

601
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:50,910
Let's go!

602
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:52,990
You listen to me ever!

603
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:07,400
Baran.

604
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:41,150
Govend here is your tea.

605
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:43,800
Thank you.

606
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:49,660
You do not like my tea?

607
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:51,240
If so.

608
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:53,910
It is a little bitter for me.

609
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:57,230
I like it like that.

610
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:59,710
I too infused or I put too.

611
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:09,440
It will not?

612
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:10,800
Excuse me.

613
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:16,030
It is because of the children?

614
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,270
- They do not come?
- No.

615
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:26,870
What are you going to do?

616
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,910
I do not know.
I have no solution.

617
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:36,270
You're going to apply for a
transfer?

618
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:38,750
I could.

619
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:43,190
Excuse me I have to go.

620
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:46,950
If ever a child arrives.

621
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,110
It is better that I be there.

622
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:26,550
What are you doing here?

623
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:28,830
Welcome my brothers.

624
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:31,000
Where u from?

625
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:34,950
I am not accountable to you brother.

626
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:36,630
I am your brother.

627
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:39,070
I was in the police station.

628
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:41,120
You're reassured sadu?

629
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:44,040
Not meddle with it.

630
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:47,270
That's what I want to talk to you.

631
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:49,360
Returned.

632
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:50,640
Hence.

633
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:57,870
This is the first school to be
opened in this village.

634
01:06:58,200 --> 01:06:59,470
There are problems.

635
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:02,560
What problems?

636
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:06,350
Some do not want a teacher.

637
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:09,710
This is not the problem.

638
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:12,630
We heard of a man!

639
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:15,870
We trust you my sister.

640
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:18,760
But we heard gossip.

641
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:22,110
Is to reassure the father sends us.

642
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:24,830
Leave me alone.

643
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:28,950
Taqiyeddine and his family returned
to ask your hand.

644
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:31,950
I have the right to have an opinion?

645
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:34,270
- Yes.
- I dont no!

646
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:37,110
I never marry with taqiyeddine.

647
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:38,470
Clear?

648
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:50,270
Why are you doing this to him?

649
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:52,430
Down a tone.

650
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:54,840
Not forget to whom you speak.

651
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:12,550
You exhaust me.

652
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:15,110
You make me mad.

653
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:50,110
On the hill!

654
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:54,030
Whore burst!

655
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:54,990
I regret that it happens like that.

656
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:11,860
I give up.

657
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:13,990
I'm leaving.

658
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:24,710
Collabo!

659
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:35,110
It's good we go!

660
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:42,830
Uncle you okay?

661
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:32,910
It's up to you my lord.

662
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:36,310
Goes!

663
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:21,520
As will be alive aga.

664
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:25,110
You and your bitch will never have
peace.

665
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:10,920
Baran.

666
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:14,950
We can find a compromise.

667
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:34,110
I do not compromise.

668
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,790
Govend quickly do your suitcase!

669
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:04,390
Father is waiting for you.

670
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:06,590
It was you who decided or father?

671
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:08,060
Shut your mouth!

672
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:10,830
You are our honor.

673
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:12,630
We have to protect you.

674
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:16,070
Have you your honor I take care of
mine!

675
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:34,400
Get up!

676
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:36,470
You totally tried.

677
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:38,630
We must wash our honor.

678
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:39,990
Our father decides.

679
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:42,070
I do not give him that bitch!

680
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:44,550
You totally tried.

681
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:46,670
Shame on you!

682
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:48,080
He hath kissed?

683
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:49,240
Shame on you!

684
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:51,750
You are no different occupant.

685
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:54,540
You are like the soldiers of Saddam.

686
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:56,920
Dare you say that?

687
01:20:57,840 --> 01:20:59,030
We love you my sister.

688
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:00,360
