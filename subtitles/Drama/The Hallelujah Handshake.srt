44
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,636
<i>The land at first.

45
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,673
<i>Mountains thrust forth
from the molten darkness of the earth.

46
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,395
<i>Mountain and valley.

47
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,715
<i>The virgin West.

48
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,276
<i>High plateau
and red rock of sandstone.

49
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,076
<i>Wilderness West.

50
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:56,719
<i>Prairie land, rolling on and on
to the end of sight.

51
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,117
<i>Oh, pioneer West.

52
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,833
<i>What fervent dreams lay half-buried
in this land of promise?

53
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,952
<i>Dreams crushed by a cruel nature

54
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,753
<i>or the lance of an Indian warrior.

55
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,039
<i>Every page in history
must have its beginning,

56
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,311
<i>and ours takes us to the year 1867.

57
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,273
<i>An army that had fought
in the war between the states,

58
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,473
<i>that had bravely battled
in many an Indian campaign,

59
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,637
<i>now patrolled the West
in a time of peace,

60
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,320
<i>with ever-present thoughts of home.

61
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,036
<i>The Indian was back
on the reservation,

62
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:39,950
<i>where the Peace Commission of 1867
had met with various warlike tribes

63
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,799
<i>and secured certain promises
from them.

64
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,798
<i>In return,
papers were given to Indians,

65
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,153
<i>certifying them to be good citizens
who would obey the laws of the land.

66
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,555
<i>Many gifts were distributed.

67
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,955
<i>Beads,

68
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,155
<i>pieces of cloth,

69
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,070
<i>ammunition,

70
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,195
<i>and war-surplus rifles.

71
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,751
<i>Naturally, these rifles were
quite unfamiliar to the Indians.

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,197
<i>Of course, it was understood
these weapons were to be used

73
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,880
<i>solely for the purpose
of hunting game.

74
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,074
<i>The leaves turned early in that year.

75
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,230
<i>It could be a long, hard winter.

76
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,235
<i>The signs were everywhere.

77
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:49,514
<i>In the high country, the morning frost
would sometimes last until afternoon.

78
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,756
<i>Buffalo were feeding ravenously.

79
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,793
<i>Beaver were damming
and storing with strange vigour.

80
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:00,232
<i>Horses and dogs were becoming
shaggy-haired as never before.

81
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:05,156
<i>And it could be sensed in the booming,
bustling mining town of Denver.

82
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:10,715
<i>Most historians agree that the events
leading to the Battle of Whiskey Hills

83
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,434
<i>and the subsequent disaster
at Quicksand Bottoms

84
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,791
<i>began here in Denver,
at a miners' meeting.

85
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,549
<i>Such meetings were frequent

86
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:22,949
<i>and held as part
of the political fabric of the town.

87
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:28,072
<i>But the meeting of November 4th
had a marked air of grim foreboding.

88
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,348
Quiet! I got an announcement
I gotta make.

89
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,032
In 10 days from now
the city of Denver will be bone dry.

90
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,593
No!

91
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,393
Not one drop of whiskey anywhere.

92
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,371
Speak up! We can't hear ya!

93
00:05:43,572 --> 00:05:47,313
I said Denver will be bone dry
in 10 days.

94
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,714
You heard what I said.
I said plumb out and I mean out!

95
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,318
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

96
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:02,636
I thought Bert Keeler was gettin'
in a big order, but he was sick.

97
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,136
Sam Buford was gettin' in 60 barrels,

98
00:06:05,137 --> 00:06:06,912
but Sam got his foot caught
in that bear trap.

99
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,474
He didn't tell Shelby
to get his 50 barrels, so...

100
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,876
So with four big orders outta reach,
there ain't nobody else put in.

101
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,788
- Now, take this here saloon alone.
- That's all there is.

102
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,833
Look at it. And there's already been
snow flurries along Gunner's Pass.

103
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,916
If we get ourselves a hard, cold winter,

104
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,112
there won't be a wagonload of whiskey
in Denver till spring.

105
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,231
And it could be a late spring.

106
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:32,276
Hold it! So what we need,
we need us a plan.

107
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,068
Hey! What does Oracle say?

108
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,836
Afternoon, gents.

109
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,599
Oracle, what about this here winter?

110
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,199
The buffalo are feedin' ravenous.

111
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,993
The beaver are workin' somethin' fierce.

112
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,750
The horses and dogs are growin'
shaggy-haired like never before.

113
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,716
What else? Have you seen anything else?

114
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,994
Yep, I had me a vision on, uh...
Oh, it come on me two days ago.

115
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,475
- Well?
- What'd you see?

116
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,396
Uh...

117
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,476
Why, thank you.

118
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,394
At the feed store, it was.
Come on more sudden than most.

119
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,717
I was lookin' up, and there it was.

120
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,195
- What was it?
- Snow.

121
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,515
Heavy, white snow.

122
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,676
Yep, it's gonna be a long, hard winter.

123
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,634
And when a long, hard winter hits us,
by damn, she hits.

124
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,116
- No wagons gettin' through, no supplies?
- And no whiskey.

125
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,798
- You know.
- Yep.

126
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,992
It come on me two days ago.
We gotta have a plan.

127
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,793
- What kinda plan, Oracle?
- Uh, let me just...

128
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:22,311
<i>Hallelujah!

129
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,396
There! Now I see it!

130
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,555
I see all of us a-comin' together.
I, um...

131
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,758
I see us...
puttin' all the whiskey orders into

132
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:37,437
one big shipment for the whole winter.

133
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,752
I see us gettin'
an ironclad guarantee from, uh...

134
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,276
from some good company like, uh, uh...

135
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,075
Thank you. Like Frank Wallingham...

136
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,992
to get them drinkables to our saloons
right now afore the snows hit.

137
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,075
I, uh...

138
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,716
I see a wagon train, a whole
wagon train loaded up with whiskey

139
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,035
a-comin' down on us from Julesburg.

140
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,516
I see 20...

141
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,796
30...

142
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,318
40 wagons.

143
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,318
- Are you Hobbs?
- I am, sir.

144
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,632
- Did you print that?
- I did, sir.

145
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,911
- And who, may I ask, are you?
- Frank Wallingham.

146
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,350
I see. How do you do?
Won't you sit down, Mr. Wallingham?

147
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,278
No. I wanna know why.
Why did you do it?

148
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,755
I've done nothing but print the truth.

149
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,589
600 barrels of Philadelphia-brewed
whiskey moving from here to Denver.

150
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:48,635
Yes. Then what happens when the Indians
get wind of 40 wagons full of firewater?

151
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:52,230
- They'll scalp us from head to foot.
- Indians don't read newspapers.

152
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,670
- Who says they don't?
- The Indian problem's all settled.

153
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,234
Haven't you read
the Peace Commissioners' report?

154
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,318
All right, then. Worse than Indians!
Revenue agents!

155
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,034
Oh... Haven't paid
your federal taxes, huh?

156
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,838
Of course I pay my taxes!
I'm an honest businessman.

157
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:08,517
<i>And</i> a good Republican.

158
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,837
But give those snoopers a taste of honey
and they'll swarm down

159
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,996
from every direction but up.

160
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,759
- You have my sympathy.
- Sympathy?

161
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,235
It's because
I didn't advertise in your rag,

162
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,433
- because I didn't give you free whiskey.
- You'd better get outta here.

163
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,075
You listen to me. I've got every cent
that I own tied up in this cargo.

164
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,670
By damn, I'm gonna see it gets to Denver.
You can print that, sir.

165
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,915
I shall.

166
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,793
I'm sending a telegram to
Colonel Gearhart at Fort Russell.

167
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:39,038
I am demanding an entire troop of
US cavalry as escort. Print that, sir!

168
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,912
- I shall.
- Good.

169
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,998
You should also put in your paper
that I say

170
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:48,079
that any tax snooper, white road agent
or Red Indian that comes near my wagons

171
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,509
had better be wearin'
cast-iron underwear.

172
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,234
And if you try to blackmail me
one more time,

173
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,511
I'll come back here and cram
this down your lyin' throat.

174
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,596
Good day, sir.

175
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,958
- Smythe.
- Yes, sir.

176
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,913
What's the name of that
temperance woman? Martindale?

177
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,032
Massingale, sir.
Cora Templeton Massingale.

178
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,152
Oh, yes, Massingale.
Do you know where she is?

179
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:30,912
On a tour of New England last month, sir.
Then Boston, to Philadelphia, to Trenton.

180
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,998
She may be a female hellcat
about whiskey, sir,

181
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,510
but a fine figure of a woman,
with eyes...

182
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,437
- Smythe.
- Sir?

183
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,516
I asked you where she is.

184
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,996
Oh. At Fort Russell, sir.
She got there yesterday.

185
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,554
Fort Russell?

186
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,353
Send a telegram to her. Mark it urgent.

187
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,118
<i>The editor of the Julesburg Gazette
was quite right.

188
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,595
<i>Indians did not read newspapers.

189
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,009
<i>It's a matter of speculation therefore

190
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:02,309
<i>just how they did
hear of the whiskey cargo.

191
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,476
<i>There were couriers, of course,

192
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:09,435
<i>and there was the smoke signal, first
used by the ancient Greeks and Hebrews.

193
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:14,714
<i>How the Indians acquired it from them
is of no importance here. But they did.

194
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,319
<i>Nor was smoke used exclusively.

195
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,750
<i>A crude mirror, painted stone,

196
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,917
<i>carved bark of trees
were quite popular.

197
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,788
<i>And a peculiarly knotted string.

198
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,752
<i>The message was always
transmitted in code.

199
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,156
<i>A code which no white man
was ever able to break.

200
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,311
<i>Regardless of what method
was used by the Indians,

201
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,352
<i>it's a matter of record
that news of the whiskey train

202
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,916
<i>became common knowledge
within 48 hours

203
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:52,512
<i>to every tribe of every
North American Plains Indian.

204
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,318
<i>We are still unaware

205
00:12:55,319 --> 00:13:00,193
<i>why only one tribe rode out
to investigate the firewater train.

206
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,996
<i>But it's supposed there was competition
among the various tribes for the honour.

207
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:11,799
<i>It is for us to make reconnaissance
of wagon-train position.

208
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,590
<i>It is for me
to make such reconnaissance.

209
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,914
<i>He is chief of Sioux.

210
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,440
<i>And I am chief of Crow.

211
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,316
<i>We will do it.

212
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,678
<i>You will not do it. I will do it.

213
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,830
<i>You and I are blocked.

214
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,516
<i>Yes, we are.

215
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,914
<i>Authorities agree that personal disputes
among the Plains tribes

216
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,996
<i>were settled very quickly.

217
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,715
<i>Just south of Cheyenne
stood Fort Russell,

218
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,549
<i>famous throughout the West
as a bastion of military strength

219
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,673
<i>and the home of the rugged,
disciplined, frontier soldier.

220
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,031
<i>Stand up, stand up and sing it

221
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,119
<i>Beat it on the drum

222
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,711
<i>Stand, stand up and sing it

223
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,759
<i>Down with demon rum

224
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,311
<i>Stand up, stand up and sing it

225
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,433
<i>Raise our banners high

226
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,958
<i>Victory is coming

227
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,391
<i>Victory is nigh, believers

228
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,353
<i>Victory is nigh

229
00:14:54,240 --> 00:15:01,078
And now, ladies, I give you once again
Mrs. Cora Templeton Massingale.

230
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,030
Oh, thank you, thank you!
Your reception has warmed my heart.

231
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,915
Ladies, you have heard it said
that man is all mouth and muscle,

232
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:20,079
that he is dirty boots on one end
and a dirty mind on the other.

233
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,758
Don't you believe it.

234
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,634
If we are to enjoy equal rights with man,
we must respect him,

235
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,958
and, if we are to respect him,
then we must save him from himself

236
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,231
and from the poison of alcoholic spirits!

237
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,954
- Do you agree?
- Yes!

238
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,036
Then let the world know it.

239
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,836
Let us spread the word of emancipation
to every corner of this great nation.

240
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,633
Emancipation! Let me hear it!

241
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,069
Emancipation!

242
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,909
- Freedom for women!
- Freedom for women!

243
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,272
Shout it out, ladies!
Women can remake the world!

244
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,312
Women can remake the world!

245
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:06,116
<i>Mine eyes have seen the glory
of the coming of the Lord

246
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,835
<i>He is trampling out the vintage
where the grapes of wrath are stored

247
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:13,635
<i>He hath loosed the fateful lightning
of his terrible swift sword

248
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,639
<i>His truth is marching on

249
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,550
<i>Glory, glory, hallelujah

250
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:25,350
<i>Glory, glory, hallelujah

251
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,951
<i>Glory, glory, hallelujah

252
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,914
<i>His truth is marching on

253
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,154
Ladies! Let me hear it!

254
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,635
Emancipation!

255
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,833
- Shout it out!
- Freedom for women!

256
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:47,950
- Once again!
- Women can remake the world!

257
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,152
What do you think, Sergeant?

258
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,975
I hate to say it, Colonel,
but it sounds like

259
00:17:01,976 --> 00:17:04,671
Sioux or Cheyenne war cries to me, sir.

260
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,756
An uprising at the fort?

261
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,630
- Ridiculous.
- Yes, sir.

262
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:16,308
<i>I can read his righteous sentence
by the dim and flaring lamps

263
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:20,558
<i>His truth is marching on

264
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,950
Those are bugles, sir.

265
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,830
<i>Glory, glory, hallelujah

266
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,590
<i>Glory, glory, hallelujah

267
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,231
<i>Glory, glory, hallelujah

268
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:42,148
<i>His truth is marching on

269
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,075
<i>Glory, glory, hallelujah

270
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,477
<i>Glory, glory, hallelujah

271
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,231
<i>Glory, glory, hallelujah

272
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,115
<i>His truth is marching on

273
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,756
That's cannon, sir!

274
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,237
- Form a skirmish line to the left!
- Form a skirmish line to the left! Ho!

275
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,513
<i>In the beauty of the lilies
Christ was born across the sea

276
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:29,269
<i>With a glory in his bosom
that transfigures you and me

277
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,670
Draw carbines! Ho!

278
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,915
Company B returning. Open the gates.

279
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,793
<i>Glory, glory...

280
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,718
- My God! She's on fire, sir!
- Charge!

281
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,232
<i>Glory, glory, hallelujah

282
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,316
<i>His truth is...

283
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,038
- You!
- Good evening, Colonel.

284
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,150
Bandmaster, front and centre.

285
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,229
You're under arrest.
This entire band is under arrest.

286
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,113
You're confined to quarters
until further notice.

287
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,196
Dismissed!

288
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,076
Who are the idiots
who fired those cannon?

289
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,668
- Sergeant Perkins.
- Private McIntosh.

290
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,439
- Private Johnson.
- Private Williams.

291
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,233
Report to my quarters
tomorrow morning at nine.

292
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,554
Yes, sir.

293
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,591
Brady.

294
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:41,554
Return carbines.
In file, prepare to dismount.

295
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,636
Dismount.

296
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,477
Madam. Article twelve, section seven,
paragraph two of army regulations

297
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,037
states: "Government property cannot
be used for political demonstrations."

298
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,311
Sir, we have never designated
our movement to be political.

299
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,513
Article nine, section two, paragraph four
of army regulations clearly states

300
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,712
that civilian meetings may be held
at military installations

301
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,912
when permission has been granted
by the commanding officer.

302
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,157
The commanding officer? I see.

303
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,788
Forgive me, madam. We've been on patrol
for six days. I'm somewhat weary.

304
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,195
Captain Slater gave you
permission in my absence?

305
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,276
He did.

306
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,639
- Brady, I want this mess cleaned up.
- Yes, sir.

307
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,275
Ladies, I see you have transport.
You'll be escorted back to town.

308
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,597
The party will leave
in five minutes exactly.

309
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,278
- Madam, do you have quarters here?
- I have.

310
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,078
Then you may retire
to those quarters, madam,

311
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,193
and remake the world on some
other occasion. Good evening.

312
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,470
- Buell.
- Sir!

313
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,631
- Buell, get me Captain Slater.
- Yes, sir.

314
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,309
Excuse me, sir.
Did the colonel wish to see me?

315
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,274
- Where the hell did you come from?
- I couldn't help but overhear, sir.

316
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,359
I want the colonel to know that what
happened tonight, the way it happened,

317
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,153
was so quick that I hardly
had time to marshal my forces.

318
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,431
Did you give that woman permission
for a temperance rally?

319
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,777
Yes and no. That is, I had no idea

320
00:22:17,778 --> 00:22:19,394
it would get outta hand,
so to speak, sir.

321
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,750
What the hell did you expect?

322
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,872
Give a woman an acorn
and you're up to your rump in oak trees.

323
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,072
That's very true, sir. And I am sorry.

324
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,556
If only they hadn't started moving...
that is to say, marching.

325
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:35,229
- Led by the Fort Russell band.
- I'd say that Mrs. Massingale led them.

326
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,597
The band came next.

327
00:22:37,182 --> 00:22:39,911
You see, they were playing
<i>The Battle Hymn of the Republic</i>,

328
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:43,589
and every time they got
to "Hallelujah"... boom!

329
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:48,638
- I'm sorry, sir, about the cannon.
- Spare me the details.

330
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,716
Slater, what if word got out

331
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,718
that Fort Russell stood behind
a temperance movement?

332
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:58,038
That I, a line officer,
could ever support such a movement?

333
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,310
Well, you got a point there, sir.

334
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:05,151
- And you let them go right ahead.
- Well, I, uh...

335
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,336
Actually, I was trying to keep

336
00:23:06,337 --> 00:23:08,594
the colonel's daughter out of it,
for your sake.

337
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,470
What's my daughter got to do with this?

338
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,034
- Well, your daughter...
- Please.

339
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,833
I beg you not to hold
Paul responsible, Father.

340
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,916
It was my fault. I was the one who...

341
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,919
She was not. And I refuse to allow her
to accept responsibility. I was the one.

342
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,712
- You were not.
- Yes, I was.

343
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,989
Paul...

344
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,999
- In my own quarters.
- We're sorry, Father, truly we are.

345
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,997
- B-but...
- But what?

346
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,076
But...

347
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:39,157
But may I point out, sir, that you have
the only private quarters at the fort,

348
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,158
and we didn't expect you back so soon.

349
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:45,158
It's true that Miss Gearhart
has her own quarters, sir,

350
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:50,035
but I thought that my presence there
might put her in a compromising position.

351
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,175
Since my own quarters are shared,
sir...

352
00:23:52,178 --> 00:23:53,391
Slater! Answer me.

353
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,876
- I'm trying to, sir.
- He isn't either, not truthfully.

354
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,095
He wasn't keeping me out

355
00:23:58,096 --> 00:24:00,390
of the temperance meeting,
I was keeping <i>him</i>.

356
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:04,035
I thought he might try to stop
the marching, so this seemed a lovely...

357
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:07,357
I mean, a way... to divert him.

358
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,156
Louise.

359
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,669
You don't really mind, do you, darling?

360
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,713
I mean, you certainly couldn't have
enjoyed yourself any the less.

361
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,796
Louise!

362
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:25,111
Well, I'd do anything for
Cora Massingale and her cause.

363
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:29,153
And if you've hurt her, Father,
I'll never forgive you.

364
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,511
- Slater.
- Yes, sir.

365
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,496
The women, the rally, the cannon.

366
00:24:47,317 --> 00:24:48,952
I'll chalk it all up
to your inexperience.

367
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,035
Thank you, sir.

368
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,048
But you cannot...

369
00:24:51,788 --> 00:24:55,314
you simply cannot use my quarters for...
for this sort of thing.

370
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,759
I'm sorry, sir.

371
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,699
Why don't you just get on with it
and marry the girl?

372
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,919
Stop all this lying around?

373
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,914
Well, the colonel knows
my feelings about that, sir.

374
00:25:02,915 --> 00:25:05,352
The West is no life for a woman.

375
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,836
The West is no life for anyone.
Wind, dust, Indians.

376
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:13,316
I hate the wind. I hate the dust.
And I hate the Indians.

377
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,718
Yes, I know. And until my transfer
comes through to an eastern post, I'll...

378
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,635
I'll drink to that.

379
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,116
To you and Louise and a transfer.
There you are.

380
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:29,078
- I can't, sir.
- Why not?

381
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,510
I haven't said good night to Louise yet.
The liquor on my breath...

382
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,110
- She knows you drink, she knows I drink.
- I know that, sir, but...

383
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,994
If you had seen her at that meeting
tonight. She heard Mrs. Massingale.

384
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:43,874
Her eyes all lit up.
Frightened hell out of me, sir.

385
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,434
All right. Go to her.
Do whatever it is you do.

386
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,915
- Thank you, sir.
- But not on my bear rug!

387
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,996
No. No, sir.

388
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,155
Slater.

389
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:59,398
Here. Escort for a wagon train.
Fella named Wallingham.

390
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,590
Taxpayer, good Republican.

391
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:05,952
I want you to figure out how to intercept
the train and escort them to Denver.

392
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,834
Denver? That'll take over a week.
I promised Louise...

393
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,110
I know, I know. She'll cry, of course.

394
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,754
Just tell her duty is a cruel master.

395
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:22,314
Yes, sir. Duty... is a cruel... master.

396
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,079
Yes, sir. Thank you. Good night, sir.

397
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,190
- Colonel Gearhart?

398
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,956
Colonel?

399
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,516
Colonel?

400
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,959
I, uh...

401
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,236
I don't wish to intrude
on your privacy, Colonel, but...

402
00:26:57,737 --> 00:26:59,392
this is vitally important.

403
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,715
I'm taking a bath.

404
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,876
The sight of a gentleman taking his bath

405
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,629
is not foreign to a woman
who's been widowed twice.

406
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,991
Well... Would you care to have a seat?

407
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:17,953
No, thank you. What I have to say
is best said standing.

408
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,389
You'll forgive me if I don't get up.

409
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,670
It's not necessary.

410
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,167
Mrs. Massingale,

411
00:27:28,268 --> 00:27:32,511
I've already told Captain Slater
I won't hold him responsible.

412
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,757
In your case, I've written off
the entire incident. So now...

413
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,632
That's not why I'm here.

414
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,389
I have received a telegram from Julesburg
that distresses me deeply.

415
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,956
It says a train of 40 wagons left there
yesterday bound for Denver

416
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,231
and that you are to furnish
military escort for that train.

417
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,715
Is that information correct?

418
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:54,037
I received a request to that effect, yes.

419
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:59,359
Were you aware, Colonel, that the cargo
of those 40 wagons is alcohol?

420
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,952
- No, ma'am.
- Well, now you know.

421
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,878
Tell me, Colonel, are you
going to furnish escort?

422
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,752
Yes, ma'am.

423
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,952
I respectfully request
that you reconsider, Colonel.

424
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,709
In the name of suffering humanity,
I implore you to halt that wagon train

425
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,196
and destroy this poison
that they're carrying.

426
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:27,199
What you ask is... What you ask
is impossible. The cargo is legal.

427
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,198
I have no grounds nor wish
to destroy civilian property.

428
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,754
And now, madam, will you
leave me to my bath?

429
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,155
Is it legal to sell whiskey to Indians?

430
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,750
Who said anything...
Who said anything about Indians?

431
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,599
The cargo is headed for Denver,
for businessmen there.

432
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,678
- How do you know?
- I have the owner's word for it.

433
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,439
Mr. Frank Wallingham,
who is an acquaintance,

434
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,074
a taxpayer, and a good Republican.

435
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:54,356
Well, in that case,
you force me to take action.

436
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:58,397
Our movement has many friends
in many high places.

437
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,114
Men such as... Horace Greeley.

438
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,871
Is that a threat?

439
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,470
You can consider it such if you like.
My conscience forces me to make it.

440
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,750
And mine demands that I do my duty.

441
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,396
So be it.

442
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:22,915
May I impose upon your kindness for
directions to the post telegraph office?

443
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,796
Mrs. Massingale,
I'll do better than that.

444
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:30,595
I'll furnish you transportation
to the Cheyenne telegraph office,

445
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,837
where your messages are sure
to get out twice as quickly.

446
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,679
Thank you.

447
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,903
Call on me again if there's
anything further I can do.

448
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,148
You're a very generous man, Colonel.

449
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,476
Right turn! Ho!

450
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,714
Three telegrams, sir, just arrived.

451
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,676
Read them.

452
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,350
"The Governor of Colorado is
against liquor and its vicissitudes,

453
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,278
but his position makes it impossible
to take a position

454
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,960
in the matter of whiskey cargo
to Denver."

455
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,877
"The Adjutant General's office is
grateful to Women's Temperance

456
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,755
for the splendid morale factor they have
upon the American soldier. However..."

457
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,713
Whiskey matters must be left
to commanders in the field.

458
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,796
"Respectfully."

459
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,315
"Mr. Horace Greeley

460
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,750
has ever championed the noble cause
of temperance and suffrage,

461
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:06,317
but is unable to interfere with
constituted authority of the West."

462
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,910
Buell. Give these to Mrs. Massingale
with my compliments

463
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:16,794
and arrange transportation for her.
Her movement is moving.

464
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,516
Yes, sir.

465
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,717
<i>On the morning of November 16th,

466
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:28,278
<i>the Wallingham wagon train was moving
along north of the South Platte River.

467
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,756
<i>At the head was its owner,
Frank Wallingham,

468
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,917
<i>and its wagon master, Rafe Pike.

469
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,635
<i>To the rear was
a group of Irish teamsters

470
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,230
<i>under the leadership
of one Kevin O'Flaherty.

471
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,430
<i>The Slater patrol was turning south

472
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,233
<i>towards the course
of the Wallingham train,

473
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,920
<i>and a band of Sioux warriors
was on the move,

474
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,634
<i>led by the great Chief 5 Barrels

475
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,752
<i>and his sub-chief, Walks-Stooped-Over,

476
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:01,313
<i>who was also known in certain
Indian circles as Sky Eyes,

477
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,590
<i>due to the blue colour of his eyes,

478
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:09,511
<i>the heritage apparently of some slight,
uh... irregularity in his ancestry.

479
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,918
- Please, Father, be reasonable.
- No.

480
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:16,919
If Mrs. Massingale wants a farewell
meeting, she may use the mess hall.

481
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,951
But I will not attend.

482
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,275
But we're not asking you
to take the pledge.

483
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,676
Although a bit of temperance
might make you happier.

484
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,633
No red-blooded drinking man
is more temperate than I am.

485
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,876
And I'm happy. I'm damned happy.

486
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,960
If you would only try to
understand Mrs. Massingale,

487
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,275
a woman who's lost
two husbands to alcohol.

488
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,914
They drank themselves
into an early grave.

489
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,996
I can only wonder why.

490
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,792
Do you absolutely refuse, Father,
to attend this meeting?

491
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,718
I do, and I'm beginning
to regret giving you the hall.

492
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,115
The least you can do
is release the post band.

493
00:32:49,139 --> 00:32:49,839
No.

494
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,149
- But we can't sing hymns without them.
- Good.

495
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,748
- There's no point in having the meeting.
- Splendid.

496
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,836
Please, Father.

497
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:02,396
It means so much to us.
And Mrs. Massingale is leaving.

498
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,476
We may never see her again.

499
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,598
- Can I depend on that?
- Oh, I never go back on my word.

500
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,154
I shall say goodbye at the meeting.

501
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,838
Well, maybe the trombone.

502
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,394
Thank you, Father. You're a dear.

503
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:21,592
- And the drums?
- No. No drums.

504
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,515
Good afternoon.

505
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,757
<i>Stand up, stand up and sing it

506
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,999
<i>Raise our banners high

507
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,358
<i>Victory is coming

508
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,991
<i>Victory is nigh, believers

509
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,395
<i>Victory is nigh

510
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,319
- What's goin' on over there?
- Singing, sir.

511
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,999
- You have guards at every exit?
- As you ordered, sir.

512
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:55,317
You'd better double the guards.
Check the exits yourself.

513
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,318
If they break out of that hall
in marching formation...

514
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:02,149
- That's what happened to Captain Slater.
- Yes, sir.

515
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,237
Ladies, our enemy has two heads.

516
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,477
First, the enslavement of women by men.

517
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,794
Yes.

518
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,992
And second, the enslavement
of men themselves

519
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,509
by the remorseless tyrant alcohol.

520
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,712
- Are we willing to fight these enemies?
- Yes.

521
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,876
Then we must reach out for freedom,

522
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,833
and tear this tyrant
from the lips of man.

523
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:33,230
Now, ladies, I have
an announcement to make

524
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:36,750
to each and every one of you
who has touched my heart.

525
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:41,237
The time has come for me to say goodbye
to all you wonderful women...

526
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,793
Thank God!

527
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:46,196
Something has occurred
which requires my presence elsewhere.

528
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,472
- I am going to the city of Denver.
- Denver?

529
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:54,389
I know, I know. You ask me
"Why Denver?" I'll tell you why.

530
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:57,830
Because 40 wagons of whiskey
are going to Denver right now.

531
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:02,238
40 wagons of poison
for those poor misguided citizens,

532
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,430
and no one in high office seems to care.

533
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,278
Well, I do!

534
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,550
And I shall shout it over and over

535
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:13,276
until the mountains of Colorado come
tumbling down to the Denver saloons.

536
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:17,274
- Will your hearts go with me?
- Yes!

537
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,553
- Is our cause just and righteous?
- Yes!

538
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:26,712
- I've doubled the guards, sir.
- I want <i>you</i> to guard the main entrance.

539
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,957
- Do I have your blessings?
- Yes!

540
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,115
No!

541
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:34,437
No! I cannot let you go
to that sinful city alone.

542
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,352
If you'll have me, Mrs. Massingale,
I'll go with you.

543
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,951
Get over there.
Drag my daughter off that platform.

544
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,273
Oh, how wonderful, ladies!

545
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,756
- Oh, ladies, we'll <i>all</i> go to Denver.
- Yes!

546
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:58,078
- We'll make it our marching song.
- Yes!

547
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:03,433
<i>Stand up, we'll march to Denver

548
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,911
<i>No more wine or beer

549
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,999
<i>Stand up, we'll march to Denver

550
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,631
<i>We will have no fear

551
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,033
<i>Stand up, we'll march to Denver

552
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:22,755
<i>Raise our banners high

553
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,271
<i>Denver, we are coming

554
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:30,435
<i>Denver will be dry, believers

555
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:33,752
<i>Denver will be dry

556
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:38,033
<i>Stand up, we'll march to Denver

557
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,437
<i>Down with demon rum

558
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:45,468
<i>Stand up, we'll march to Denver

559
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,356
<i>Denver, here we come

560
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:53,354
<i>Stand up, we'll march to Denver

561
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:57,270
<i>Lift our banners high...

562
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,516
Well, Buell?

563
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,549
Just... tryin' to get my wind back, sir.

564
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,156
Knocked me flat, sir.

565
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,998
Did you hear what that...
woman said, sir?

566
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,031
I did.

567
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,435
- But, sir...
- "But, sir" what?

568
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,155
How can we let them
go through with it, sir?

569
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,997
March to Denver
through country like this,

570
00:37:22,098 --> 00:37:24,114
without escort or protection?

571
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,708
What if they come upon
a bunch of Indians, sir?

572
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,195
I suggest we pray for the Indians.

573
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:34,312
Can the... the army refuse escort, sir?

574
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,440
From now on, the army will do
what I tell it to do.

575
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,711
What, uh...
What do you intend to do, sir?

576
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:28,993
- Good morning, Miss Gearhart.
- Good morning, Sergeant Buell.

577
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,836
Go away.

578
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,316
Louise, will you please go away?

579
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,954
This should make you feel better.
Nice hot milk.

580
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,590
What's going on out there?

581
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,354
Will you stop that infernal uproar?

582
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:49,389
You will not under any circumstances
go off with that... that woman.

583
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,239
Yes, Father.

584
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,391
To Denver or anyplace else.
I want that clearly understood.

585
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,476
Yes, Father.

586
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,514
Now will you please leave me alone?

587
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:09,034
Is he better?

588
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,116
I'm afraid not.

589
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:15,031
Louise, go and get me some
more blankets. Lots of them.

590
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:18,709
I want him to perspire. We will
sweat the poison out of his system.

591
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,513
Blankets. All right, Mrs. Massingale.

592
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,995
- Mrs. Massingale!
- Lie back.

593
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,110
- Madam...
- Back.

594
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:42,797
Now... just be quiet, please.
Don't exert yourself.

595
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:46,632
- Madam, we have a surgeon.
- Just relax.

596
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,716
Let the blood flow.

597
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,717
Now tell me, Colonel, does
the pain centre lie about here?

598
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,796
Look, Mrs...

599
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:00,117
- It's a little higher.
- A little higher. Yes, of course.

600
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:10,479
- About this march, Mrs. Massingale...
- Just unwind.

601
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,239
This march to Denver... impossible.

602
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:17,519
Right here, at this junction,
Colonel, a series of cords.

603
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:23,672
And beneath them, intertwined nerves
like fine silk threads.

604
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,079
Matters of... transportation.

605
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,870
Rattlesnakes...

606
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,356
All connected up to here
where the pain centre lies.

607
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,996
Examine my position.

608
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,716
Consider, if you will...

609
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:46,950
- Oh, that feels good.
- That's the key point.

610
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,517
First we rub gently downwards,

611
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,715
and then upwards,

612
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,391
and then downwards again.

613
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:00,753
Now you're beginning to relax.
I can feel it in my fingers.

614
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,836
I wish I could help you, but...

615
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,316
Army regulations.

616
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,230
Article 12,

617
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,316
section 26,

618
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,629
paragraph...

619
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,156
That's right.

620
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,549
Relax. Relax.

621
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,715
Company, attention!

622
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,714
Company, attention!

623
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,949
Good morning, Colonel Gearhart.

624
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,957
Good morning, Father.

625
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:11,036
Morning, ladies.

626
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,294
Who are those men at the gate?

627
00:43:18,395 --> 00:43:20,949
Husbands.
Not all the ladies are single.

628
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:21,849
What do they want here?

629
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:25,358
The ladies are takin'
their wagons away.

630
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,551
They want the colonel
to do something about it, sir.

631
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,312
- Sir.
- Well?

632
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,670
Does the colonel intend...

633
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,429
I mean to say, sir,
will the escort party...

634
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,870
Sir, do you really intend
to go through with this thing?

635
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,151
Buell, you've got a great deal
to learn about military science.

636
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,430
A simple matter
of objective and stratagem.

637
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:56,393
Objective - get rid of these damn women.

638
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,556
- Stratagem...
- Take 'em to Denver, sir?

639
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,353
- Mount up, Buell. Mount up.
- Yes, sir.

640
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,349
- Move them out, Brady.
- Yes, sir.

641
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,351
Twos left!

642
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:15,948
Right turn! Ho!

643
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,956
Right turn! Ho!

644
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,756
Right turn! Ho!

645
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,189
Left turn! Ho!

646
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:24,678
<i>Stand up, we'll march to Denver

647
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:28,396
<i>No more wine or beer

648
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,713
<i>Stand up, we'll march to Denver

649
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:36,357
<i>No more whiskey here

650
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:40,712
<i>Stand up, we'll march to Denver

651
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,116
- Buell!
- Sir!

652
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:50,474
One bugler, just one bugler joins in
with that singing, I'll have him shot!

653
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,556
Yes, sir.

654
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,518
<i>Stand up, we'll march to Denver

655
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:04,237
<i>Down with demon rum

656
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,396
<i>Stand up...

657
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,719
<i>It might be prudent
right at this moment

658
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:12,159
<i>to get our bearings
upon this historic arena.

659
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,317
<i>Julesburg is here.

660
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:18,353
<i>To the southwest along the South
Platte River is the city of Denver.

661
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,710
<i>North of it we find Fort Russell.

662
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:24,594
<i>The Wallingham wagon train
had moved to this point on the river.

663
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:28,110
<i>The first cavalry patrol
under Captain Slater... here.

664
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:31,471
<i>The second cavalry patrol
under Colonel Gearhart... here,

665
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:34,319
<i>with, of course,
the temperance marchers.

666
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:37,159
<i>And the band of Sioux Indians... here.

667
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:42,069
<i>In the city of Denver, another
miners' meeting was being held.

668
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:04,112
Hold it! Hold it down.
This meetin' is called to order.

669
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,496
Tell me who called this meetin',

670
00:47:06,497 --> 00:47:08,153
what for,
and what's all the hollering about!

671
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,794
I did. Clayton, we gotta face the facts.

672
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:14,230
There's been no word from
that wagon train in two weeks.

673
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:17,750
- That's right.
- There's snow already at Grizzly Pass.

674
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:43,549
- Afternoon, gents.
- Oracle, the thing is we, uh...

675
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,636
- We got trouble.
- You know?

676
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,149
That wagon train
may not never get to you.

677
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,714
- Why not?
- Why, thank you.

678
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:59,672
It was all set on comin' to me.
I, uh... I was lookin' up and, uh... uh...

679
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,756
Thank you.

680
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:04,394
<i>Hallelu...

681
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:06,670
- There! Now I see it!
- What?

682
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,836
Uh... Injuns.

683
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,918
I see hundreds of Injuns.

684
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:19,356
You see anything else, Oracle?

685
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:22,392
- I think, uh...
- <i>Hallelu</i>...

686
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:26,354
- I see men... I see men on the march.
- Cavalry?

687
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,278
Course not.
This ain't no time for children.

688
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:32,153
I see men, men carryin', uh...

689
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,589
picks and, uh...

690
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:40,076
axes and, uh... uh...

691
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,876
uh...

692
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:55,399
shovels.

693
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:59,875
- Well, who are they?
- Denver citizens' militia.

694
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,356
A-marchin' out there
to intercept that wagon train

695
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:05,436
and see that whiskey gets home.

696
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:10,076
Hold on, Oracle. We're workin' men.
We're miners. We ain't Injun fighters.

697
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:14,398
I ain't marchin' up any rivers, sleeping
on the rocks and cookin' on campfires.

698
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:18,479
You gonna spend the whole winter
in Denver without no whiskey?

699
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:37,672
<i>At dawn the morning of November 17th,

700
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:41,429
<i>the second cavalry patrol
was heading due south for Denver,

701
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:44,393
<i>with of course the temperance marchers.

702
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:48,551
<i>The Wallingham wagon train
was turning west.

703
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:52,789
<i>The first cavalry patrol
was moving fast to intercept it.

704
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:56,549
<i>The Denver citizens' militia
was making an easterly crossing

705
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:58,591
<i>of the South Platte River,

706
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:02,395
<i>while the Sioux Indians
were coming down from the north,

707
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:06,278
<i>picking up more braves all the time.

708
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:09,109
Whoa!

709
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:13,950
For the beloved love of all the saints,
St Pat and Mike and Bridget,

710
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:17,152
and all the souls in purgatory,
not again!

711
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:21,038
Call yourself a wagon!
You rotten collection of wood!

712
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:23,958
You ain't fit for carryin' swill
to vultures!

713
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:45,996
Whoa!

714
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:51,999
All right, O'Flaherty. What's your excuse
this time, you ignorant immigrant lump?

715
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:58,232
Oh, lump, is it? Well...

716
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,456
All things being equal,

717
00:51:02,657 --> 00:51:04,953
we'll be havin' a word
with your lordship.

718
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:07,992
I told you I am not a lordship!

719
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:11,590
Can't expect an Irish serf to forget
the habits of a lifetime, now.

720
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:14,188
- Just get on with it.
- Well, now.

721
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:17,710
We, the Irish Teamsters,
have a petition of grievances.

722
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:19,990
We state in plain and simple terms

723
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:23,351
the bad conditions under which
we've been forced to labour,

724
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:27,996
and do hereby raise formal objection
to the followin', to wit:

725
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:31,352
travel hours and harnessin',
unharnessin',

726
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:36,159
carin' for horses, loadin', unloadin',

727
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,315
beddin', guard duty,

728
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:42,271
poor drinkin' water,

729
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,390
order of wagons in march,
and, might I add, in addition to

730
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:49,432
no whiskey ration whatsoever

731
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:51,915
in a whole cargo of whiskey.

732
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:58,234
Now, suppose these grievances
of yours aren't answered?

733
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:03,830
- What'll you do? Strike?
- That's an ugly word to a workin' man.

734
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:06,110
- But it would be considered.
- Ah...

735
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:09,152
Well, in that case, O'Flaherty,
you strike.

736
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,997
- Strike.
- And who, might I ask, pray tell me,

737
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:17,715
are you goin' to get to drive
your sweatin', rotten wagons?

738
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,072
- There are your grievances.
- We've struck off 12 more copies.

739
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,156
Exploiter! Capitalist!

740
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:32,430
Highbinder! Profiteer!

741
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:51,309
Mr. Wallingham, I presume.
Captain Slater at your service.

742
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53,510
Colonel Gearhart sends his compliments.

743
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:57,030
He's most happy to comply with
your request for escort to Denver.

744
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:59,116
Good for Colonel Gearhart.

745
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:01,834
Have you seen any Indians?
A scout informed me...

746
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:06,556
There aren't any Indians here. Haven't
you heard of the Peace Commission?

747
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:10,275
With a cargo like this,
you've got to be sure, damn sure!

748
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,960
Indians, revenue agents,
temperance women.

749
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:14,718
- Oh, you know.
- Know what?

750
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:16,831
- About Cora Massingale.
- Where?

751
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,916
It's all right. She's not here.

752
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,838
She's at Fort Russell
giving temperance lectures.

753
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:25,669
- Are you positive she's at Fort Russell?
- I positively guarantee it.

754
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:29,429
She isn't any nearer your cargo
than... than the Indians are.

755
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:37,990
- Hope it's hot.

756
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:40,270
Wait till we get you in.

757
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,436
Oh!

758
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:28,196
Sergeant, I, uh...

759
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:45,111
We've got a morale problem, sir.

760
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,231
Take care of it, Buell.

761
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:51,751
I think the colonel will have to
root it out, sir, right at the core.

762
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:54,348
The ladies, sir, are taking baths...

763
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:58,350
in the nude.

764
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:13,948
Mrs. Massingale,
I'd like a word with you.

765
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:31,958
Would you mind calling some other time,
Colonel? I'm taking a bath.

766
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:34,116
I am well aware
that you're taking a bath.

767
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,437
I don't care how dirty you are.

768
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:38,631
I will not have you ladies
bathing in the nude.

769
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:40,751
There's no other way I know of,
Colonel.

770
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:44,395
The opportunity was there and...
who knows what tomorrow might bring?

771
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:47,432
Especially now that
we've changed our plans.

772
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:50,518
- Changed your plans?
- Yes, Colonel.

773
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:55,320
You mean you want to go
back to Cheyenne now?

774
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:59,479
Don't be ridiculous. Of course not.
We want only to meet the wagon train.

775
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:03,195
But you are meeting the train.
That's why we're going to Denver.

776
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:06,153
But we want to meet it
long before it reaches Denver.

777
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,430
- That's not possible.
- On the contrary.

778
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:12,951
We now intend to intercept
the wagon train along the River Platte.

779
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:15,750
You what?

780
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:20,868
In a clash of wills, Colonel,
he who shouts loudest is lost.

781
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,956
Madam...

782
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:24,337
If I understand you correctly,

783
00:56:24,538 --> 00:56:27,995
you are going to lead your ladies
through unsettled Plains country

784
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:31,351
- along the South Platte River trail.
- Exactly.

785
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:35,268
And upon meeting the wagon train, I
surmise you will put on a demonstration,

786
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:38,437
whose purpose is to turn back the train.

787
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:39,993
Precisely.

788
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:44,117
Very well. But if you think
the United States Army

789
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:47,835
is going to escort a bunch of
harebrained females across open desert,

790
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:52,397
bent on throwing themselves under
horse teams, you're gravely mistaken.

791
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:56,832
Very well. I thank you
for your many courtesies thus far,

792
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:00,839
but if you force us to go our way
unescorted and any harm comes to us,

793
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:06,353
three million infuriated women will
turn the War Department upside down.

794
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:13,871
Mrs. Massingale, if I could force you
to do anything, which obviously I cannot,

795
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,152
it would be to go home, and stay home,
where all decent women belong.

796
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,556
- Sergeant.
- Sir?

797
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:47,636
- Dammit.
- Yes, sir.

798
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,830
Sergeant, I want some scouts
on the trail of those women tomorrow.

799
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:55,269
Have them keep
in constant touch with us.

800
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:57,755
We'll move in a somewhat
parallel direction.

801
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,836
Yes, sir.

802
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:04,870
Excuse me, sir. Parallel direction...

803
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:08,518
Is that a new tactic, sir?
I'm not acquainted with it.

804
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:12,315
- It was well known throughout the war.
- Yes, sir, of course.

805
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,114
- What's it called, sir?
- Called?

806
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:20,916
What command shall I give the men?
"Move in a somewhat parallel direction"?

807
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,952
It's called... detached contact.

808
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:26,594
Detached contact?

809
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:29,518
And let it so be recorded
in the daily journal!

810
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:32,516
Yes, sir.

811
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:59,151
<i>No documents can establish just how
the Sioux formulated their plans,

812
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:02,431
<i>although it's known
that a plan was so formulated.

813
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:04,755
<i>All we can do is surmise what was said.

814
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:12,273
<i>White man win war.
Now we use white man's way.

815
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:20,355
<i>You, Chief Walks-Stooped-Over, with
20 braves attack front of wagon train,

816
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,436
<i>and draw off guard.

817
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:27,150
<i>You, Chief Elks-Runner, with 20 braves

818
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:30,909
<i>attack rear of wagon train
and draw off guard.

819
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:34,396
<i>All other braves
attack centre of wagon train.

820
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:37,389
<i>When Long Knives chase braves,

821
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:41,433
<i>then great Chief 5 Barrels
and two brothers-in-law

822
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:45,394
<i>circle around whole wagon train,
come in from southeast,

823
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:49,035
<i>grab last three wagons
and go like hell... west.

824
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:55,194
<i>In the morning, when the sun rises
over Iron Mountain two hands high,

825
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:58,156
<i>attack!

826
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:03,999
<i>If Long Knives capture braves,
show them paper.

827
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:06,554
<i>We good Indians. No trouble.

828
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:10,030
<i>Go back to reservation.

829
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:13,709
<i>But before you go,
don't forget to ask for presents.

830
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:22,790
<i>In preparation for their attack,
the Indians took up three positions.

831
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:24,399
<i>Here...

832
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:25,555
<i>here...

833
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:27,352
<i>and here.

834
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:30,472
<i>The Wallingham wagon train
was moving in this direction,

835
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:33,433
<i>escorted by the first cavalry patrol.

836
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:35,710
<i>The temperance marchers,

837
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:38,718
<i>having turned east,
were moving in this direction.

838
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:40,189
<i>The second cavalry patrol

839
01:00:40,190 --> 01:00:43,436
<i>under Colonel Gearhart was
keeping detached contact.

840
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:47,997
<i>The citizens' militia were now heading
due north at this position.

841
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:51,669
<i>Obviously, a collision course
for all concerned.

842
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:57,673
<i>The day began with a sandstorm
of disturbing proportions.

843
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:12,875
- Hey, Rafe. Rafe! Rafe!
- What?

844
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,719
- Get 'em moved up back there!
- Huh?

845
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:17,990
Let's get them wagons moved up!

846
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:21,878
- Keep your eye on them Irishmen!
- What?

847
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:25,393
- Watch out for them agitators!
- Huh?

848
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:27,670
Oh, shut up!

849
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:35,872
Arise! Break away now.
They'll think we're lost in the storm.

850
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,355
They'll have to give in to our demands.

851
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:53,669
Keep together, everybody,
and keep moving!

852
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:56,109
Don't despair. We'll get through.

853
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:59,789
Buell, take a scout. Make contact
with the women. They may need help.

854
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,876
Sir. Phillips!

855
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:13,000
- Oracle, can you see anything?
- Nothing.

856
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:16,678
- I mean, in your mind.
- I need whiskey.

857
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:21,629
<i>Stand up, we'll march to Denver

01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:46,552
<i>Hallelujah, hallelu, Hallelujah Trail

935
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:50,873
<i>Hallelujah, hallelujah

936
01:14:51,240 --> 01:15:00,512
<i>Hallelujah, hallelu, Hallelujah Trail

937
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,389
- It's a miracle.
- I beg your pardon, sir?

938
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:50,877
A miracle of the highest order that so
many bullets could miss so many people

939
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,878
in so small an area
in such a short space of time.

940
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:58,198
- No fatalities at all?
- None reported, sir.

941
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:01,949
- What do you propose that we do now?
- Our duty is crystal clear.

942
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:04,719
The first thing we must do
is keep the peace.

943
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:07,229
- Do you agree, Buell?
- Absolutely, sir.

944
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:10,158
There are three important steps
to peace negotiations.

945
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:13,033
No fraternisation
and no discharge of firearms.

946
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:14,354
Yes, sir.

947
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:18,632
- And the third step, sir?
- The third step? It's not important.

948
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:20,296
What is important is to have
a conference.

949
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:22,833
No peace without a conference, Slater.

950
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:26,953
Buell, inform all interested parties
a conference will be held here

951
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:29,435
- in one hour from now.
- Yes, sir.

952
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:35,275
Beyond that,
my contract - I got it here - says

953
01:16:35,276 --> 01:16:36,871
that I am going to deliver,

954
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,514
and I am gonna deliver,
come hell or high water.

955
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:42,359
You gotta get them
damn foreigners outta here.

956
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:45,517
- Mr. Wallingham...
- I am a taxpayer and a good Republican,

957
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:47,631
which means I am entitled to army escort.

958
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:50,877
I'm damn well gonna get army escort
or I'm gonna raise hell...

959
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,752
- Mr. Wallingham.
- What?

960
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:56,236
I will not tolerate profanity
in the presence of ladies.

961
01:16:57,600 --> 01:16:59,556
Oh...

962
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:03,028
I think we understand
your position by now.

963
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:06,914
The next party to be heard from
will be... uh... uh... Who are you?

964
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:11,395
My name is Clayton Howell, sir,
commander of the Denver Free Militia.

965
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:13,829
- What do you want?
- I'd like to inform the colonel

966
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:17,748
that a lot of us here are members of
the Denver Saloon Owners' Association,

967
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:21,156
and we intend to receive that there cargo
and take it home with us.

968
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:23,669
The winter nights are
long and lonely in Denver,

969
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:25,791
and a man is sorely in need of comfort.

970
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:30,516
Startin' next month, that there sun
is gonna be a-settin' at 5.33pm,

971
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:32,790
and she's gonna rise
11 dark hours later...

972
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:35,912
All right. I think we can
leave the sun out of this.

973
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:39,275
- What are you doing here, Oracle?
- Colonel.

974
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:41,789
I'm the guide to the Denver Free Militia.

975
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:45,595
It is my duty to see that this
precious cargo and these good people...

976
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:49,474
Thank you, Oracle.
I'm well aware of the duties of a guide.

977
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:52,838
- You're next.
- Kevin O'Flaherty at your service, sir.

978
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:56,111
President of the Irish Teamsters.
With your permission,

979
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:58,993
I have here a resolution
containing 14 points,

980
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:01,918
which I'd like to read
prior to these labour negotiations.

981
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:03,553
Labour negotiations?

982
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:06,114
If our demands are not satisfied,
your lordship,

983
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:08,913
we intend to strike,
as nasty as that may seem.

984
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:11,634
- By damn, you just try...
- Wallingham!

985
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:13,589
Oh.

986
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:16,439
I am not gonna abandon
10 of my wagons to them Indians.

987
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:20,917
Who said you had to? You've got the
Denver Free Militia to drive your wagons.

988
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:22,951
What?

989
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:24,752
Excuse me, sir.

990
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:28,475
The militia couldn't do it, unless
we took a soldier to guard each wagon.

991
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:33,720
- They're the worst bar flies in Denver.
- And who's gonna guard the soldiers?

992
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:37,515
I see what you mean. Our supply of
temperance men is extremely limited.

993
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:39,551
Yes, sir. It sure is.

994
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:45,031
Well, since you have nothing further
to say, Mr. O'Flaherty, sit down.

995
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:48,118
- I call on Mrs. Massingale.
- Thank you very much, Colonel.

996
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:52,119
The temperance movement has now
spread right across this great nation.

997
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:53,798
Founded in the year...

998
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:56,832
Mrs. Massingale, we are not here
for a history of the movement.

999
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:59,520
- Have you anything further to say?
- I have.

1000
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:03,189
Dump it, I say. Dump this entire
vile cargo into the river right now.

1001
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:06,198
- By damn, madam...
- Mr. Wallingham!

1002
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:24,475
Did you get that, Captain?

1003
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:28,195
Not a word, but I have
an interpreter standing by. Sims!

1004
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:31,731
Yes, sir.

1005
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:36,117
Sims, find out what they're doing here,
why they left the reservation.

1006
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:51,232
<i>Hunt buffalo. Minding own business.

1007
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:55,634
<i>Then white Long Knives come along
and attack peaceful Indian.

1008
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:07,950
<i>Paper say peaceful Indian.

1009
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:13,030
<i>We go home,
but first you give us presents.

1010
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:18,237
- What'd he say?
- He said

1011
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:21,193
"Hunt buffalo in peace,
minding their own business,

1012
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:23,390
- when white Long Knives attack."
- What?

1013
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:26,592
Yes, sir. But they're willin'
to go home now, sir.

1014
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:28,938
Well, tell him he's made
a wise decision.

1015
01:20:29,039 --> 01:20:30,156
Yes, sir.

1016
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:42,559
<i>Where are presents for us?

1017
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:47,159
<i>You give me 20 wagons whiskey

1018
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:51,159
<i>or I don't take my braves home.

1019
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:53,716
<i>Period.

1020
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:00,437
Yes? What'd he say?

1021
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:03,836
He said he would like
to give you a present, sir.

1022
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:05,951
- That's fine.
- But he hasn't got one, sir.

1023
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:08,753
I see. Thank him, but tell him
no present is necessary.

1024
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:10,836
Wait... I'll tell him.

1025
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:31,351
All right, then. Tomorrow morning,
this whole, uh... this, uh...

1026
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:33,593
We're leaving for Denver.

1027
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:37,429
You will take your orders from
Sergeant Major Buell as to starting time,

1028
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:40,472
disposition of marching order,
camp sites, et cetera.

1029
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:43,160
Any decisions to be made
will be made by me.

1030
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:46,679
- Sergeant.
- Conference stands adjourned!

1031
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:27,596
- Buell.
- Yes, sir?

1032
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:30,156
What are those Indians doing here?

1033
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:33,955
- I don't know, sir.
- How long have they been following us?

1034
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:37,436
I was gonna bring that matter
to the colonel's attention.

1035
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:39,134
They've been trailing us all day, sir.

1036
01:22:39,914 --> 01:22:42,509
Shall I take a squad
and run 'em off, sir?

1037
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:44,896
Buell, the Indian wars are over.

1038
01:22:45,197 --> 01:22:47,233
These Sioux are wards
of the government.

1039
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:51,433
- How would that look in Washington?
- The colonel has a point, sir.

1040
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:56,315
Get the interpreter. Find out why they're
still here. And we'll camp early tonight.

1041
01:22:56,440 --> 01:22:59,750
- Field quarters assembly?
- Have the sentries out before dark.

1042
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:07,359
Carter, check the rest of the sentries
and find Sergeant Buell.

1043
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:26,876
<i>(water splashing)

1044
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:58,915
Phillips, what's going on here?

1045
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:01,156
Compliments of Mrs. Massingale, sir.

1046
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:02,918
She has use of another tub, sir,

1047
01:24:03,539 --> 01:24:05,956
and she thought
the colonel looked dirty, sir.

1048
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:08,753
Kind of scroungy and mucky, sir.

1049
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:11,870
And she thought... she sort of...

1050
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:15,393
Yes, sir.

1051
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:27,989
- Colonel Gearhart, sir.
- Yes?

1052
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:30,216
All sentries on their posts, sir.

1053
01:24:30,617 --> 01:24:32,379
The Denver militia has retired
for the evening.

1054
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:35,048
Where's Sergeant Buell?

1055
01:24:35,149 --> 01:24:38,159
At the Indian camp
with the interpreter.

1056
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:42,350
- That's all, Carter.
- Yes, sir.

1057
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:57,510
- Sir?
- Come in, Buell.

1058
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:01,474
The report from the interpreter, sir...

1059
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:03,636
He, uh...

1060
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:07,236
Well?

1061
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:09,916
There might be a little confusion, sir.

1062
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:12,190
- Confusion?
- Confusion. Yes, sir.

1063
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:15,710
The interpreter was only sure they said
"Hunt buffalo in peace,

1064
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:19,037
minding own business,
when white Long Knives attack."

1065
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:23,119
"Willing to go home.
Would like to give you present."

1066
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:29,635
Sergeant, get me Oracle Jones.

1067
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:32,836
Yes, sir.

1068
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:51,396
Friend.

1069
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:57,797
Go ahead. Don't beat around the bush.
Find out why the hell they're still here.

1070
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,150
He says he's waitin' for the presents.

1071
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:09,236
Presents? Wait a...

1072
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:13,357
Well, tell him we don't want
any presents, and thank him.

1073
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:25,309
Not for you, Colonel. For him.

1074
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:33,037
Just a minute. He said "Hunt buffalo
in peace, minding own business..."

1075
01:26:33,640 --> 01:26:35,471
- Sims!
- Yes, sir.

1076
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:38,672
- You're under arrest.
- Yes, sir.

1077
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:47,999
- Suppose I refuse to give them presents?
- They won't go home.

1078
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:53,396
Well, find out what they want.

1079
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:08,271
The chief says he wants 20 wagons of...
<i>minne wakan</i>... crazy water.

1080
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:11,316
20 wagons of whiskey?

1081
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:15,115
That chief...
he's a real boozer, Colonel.

1082
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:18,875
Well, you tell him no.

1083
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,594
No one's gonna blackmail
the United States Army!

1084
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:26,748
Tell him to pack up his braves and get
back where they come from. I'll tell him.

1085
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:31,952
White chief... Indian chief...
meet... as friends.

1086
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:35,191
Leave as friends.

1087
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:37,754
No crazy water, no whiskey.

1088
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:40,838
Go home in peace... But go home!

1089
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:42,916
- Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.

1090
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:48,358
<i>Hallelujah!

1091
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:50,912
There! Now I see it!

1092
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:14,760
Frank! Hold up there, Frank!

1093
01:30:16,040 --> 01:30:21,558
Frank, come sundown you head your
wagons in towards Quicksand Bottoms.

1094
01:30:21,680 --> 01:30:23,636
- Why?
- We'll be campin' there tonight.

1095
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:25,796
No, we ain't. Not this train.

1096
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:28,215
Well, sure, Frank.
You just suit yourself.

1097
01:30:28,416 --> 01:30:30,311
That's a waste of time
and horsepower.

1098
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:33,398
I'll just light out for Denver
on my lonesome.

1099
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:38,310
Wait a minute, Oracle.
You seen somethin'

1100
01:30:38,440 --> 01:30:43,195
Well now, I don't mind tellin' you
things is just beginnin' to come through.

1101
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:45,675
- What? What?
- Can't say.

1102
01:30:47,080 --> 01:30:49,230
Got somethin' to do
with Quicksand Bottoms?

1103
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:50,839
Yep.

1104
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:55,795
Rafe! Rafe! When we get to
Quicksand Bottoms, head in.

1105
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:59,435
- We're gonna camp there tonight.
- Huh?

1106
01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:03,235
When we get to Quicksand Bottoms,
head in. We're gonna camp there tonight.

1107
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:05,316
OK, Frank.

1108
01:31:14,160 --> 01:31:16,310
Militia, halt!

1109
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:22,080
Get that circle formed in there
and keep it tight.

1110
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:24,668
Stay away from the edge
of that swamp. Look out!

1111
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:27,837
Come on, move it up there.
Close it up tight!

1112
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:33,278
Stay away from the edge
of that swamp. Look out!

1113
01:31:37,640 --> 01:31:40,791
All right! All right!
Come on, the rest of ya! Watch out!

1114
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:43,036
Frank! You'd better come quick!

1115
01:31:43,160 --> 01:31:46,994
The Irish have gone on strike
and they've taken 10 of the wagons.

1116
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:58,517
Clayton! Go and rescue
that precious booze. Form up your men.

1117
01:31:58,640 --> 01:32:01,757
Militia!
Form up in a column of fours! Hup!

1118
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:09,189
Sir, the teamsters have
finally gone on strike.

1119
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:11,629
They've taken 10 wagons
and formed a circle.

1120
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:15,309
- Where's Wallingham?
- He's gettin' the militia together, sir.

1121
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:17,590
I've put a platoon
between them and the ladies.

1122
01:32:17,720 --> 01:32:20,712
- The ladies?
- They're supporting the strike, sir.

1123
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:23,798
It's quite possible
that violence is imminent.

1124
01:32:37,320 --> 01:32:39,436
Come down from there, you alien radical!

1125
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:41,312
- Capitalist!
- Anarchist!

1126
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:43,396
Hold your positions, ladies.

1127
01:32:54,920 --> 01:32:59,516
You finally got here, did ya? I want you
to get this damn mess straightened out.

1128
01:33:05,960 --> 01:33:09,555
You! Just what are you
and your ladies up to this time?

1129
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:13,278
Merely exercising our right
to peaceful assembly,

1130
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:15,319
as guaranteed by the Constitution,

1131
01:33:15,420 --> 01:33:18,838
which you, an army officer,
are sworn to uphold.

1132
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:21,555
O'Flaherty.

1133
01:33:21,680 --> 01:33:23,750
We're just honest workmen,
your lordship,

1134
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:27,475
exercising our God-given right
to refuse to work.

1135
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:31,479
Hah! You're a pack of cowards,
hidin' behind the skirts of these women.

1136
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:35,434
Besides that, you're a pack of Irish
thieves. They stole 10 of my wagons.

1137
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:39,439
- I demand you do somethin' about it.
- Now, calm yourself, Mr. Wallingham.

1138
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:42,438
I can see your wagons.
They don't look stolen to me.

1139
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:44,869
Well, they're as good as stolen, by damn!

1140
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,514
I must remind you, sir,
there are ladies present.

1141
01:33:47,640 --> 01:33:50,154
Damn right they're present.
I want 'em removed.

1142
01:33:50,280 --> 01:33:53,829
I'm sorry, Mr. Wallingham,
but this is obviously a labour dispute.

1143
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:55,594
Much as I hate to admit it,

1144
01:33:55,595 --> 01:33:58,829
Mrs. Massingale and Mr. O'Flaherty
are within their rights.

1145
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:02,191
What about my rights
as a taxpayer and a good Republican?

1146
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:06,029
I'll protect your wagons and cargo,
but under army regulations I cannot...

1147
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:09,357
All right, men. Enough of this
tin-soldier lawyer talk.

1148
01:34:09,480 --> 01:34:13,632
Club down them Irishmen.
Club 'em down and tote them women out.

1149
01:34:14,760 --> 01:34:15,977
Slater, take charge.

1150
01:34:16,799 --> 01:34:19,629
You'll meet force with force
to whatever extent is necessary.

1151
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:22,832
Companies A and B, move up! Ho!

1152
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:36,435
Draw carbines! Ho!

1153
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:42,958
Come on, get in there!
What are you waitin' for?

1154
01:34:43,880 --> 01:34:45,996
Uh... be reasonable, Frank.

1155
01:34:46,120 --> 01:34:49,476
We can't fight the United States Army.
It wouldn't look good.

1156
01:34:52,200 --> 01:34:56,671
All right, Gearhart. I'm holding you
responsible for every one of my wagons.

1157
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:59,758
- I accept the responsibility. Buell!
- Sir!

1158
01:34:59,880 --> 01:35:04,237
- We'll camp here tonight. Pick a site.
- Yes, sir. Field order 138, sir?

1159
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:09,356
Yes, sir.

1160
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:15,155
My congratulations, Mrs. Massingale. A
brilliant manoeuvre, flawlessly executed.

1161
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:17,555
Thank you, Colonel. I'm very flattered.

1162
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:20,436
Maintain order, Slater.

1163
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:38,391
Ladies.

1164
01:35:38,520 --> 01:35:40,476
Mrs. Massingale, ma'am...

1165
01:35:41,200 --> 01:35:44,636
Would you mind telling me just what
you expect to gain by all this?

1166
01:35:44,760 --> 01:35:46,239
Time, for one thing.

1167
01:35:46,360 --> 01:35:48,954
But you can't keep my wagons
immobilised for ever.

1168
01:35:49,080 --> 01:35:51,230
We'll see.

1169
01:35:51,360 --> 01:35:54,670
Would you mind telling me
what your next move might be?

1170
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:58,270
Well, apart from our non-violent
picket line, we have no plans.

1171
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:01,073
Except to have our meeting
at the Indian camp tonight.

1172
01:36:01,200 --> 01:36:03,156
- A what?
- A rally.

1173
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:04,998
A rally, Frank.

1174
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:08,192
Hold your positions, ladies.
Come along, Louise.

1175
01:36:10,120 --> 01:36:12,270
A rally at the Indian camp.

1176
01:36:14,160 --> 01:36:15,673
<i>We will save, we will save,

1177
01:36:16,040 --> 01:36:21,068
<i>we will save another soul, hallelujah

1178
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:27,708
<i>We will save, we will save,
we will save another soul

1179
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:31,355
<i>And if the road is rocky
and a man should start to slip

1180
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,753
<i>Man should start to slip,
man should start to slip

1181
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:38,429
<i>And if the road is rocky
and a man should start to slip

1182
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:41,950
<i>We will take a better grip

1183
01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:45,516
<i>And if a man gets weak
and takes a bottle from the shelf

1184
01:36:46,160 --> 01:36:48,913
<i>Bottle from the shelf,
bottle from the shelf

1185
01:36:49,040 --> 01:36:52,555
<i>And if a man gets weak
and takes a bottle from the shelf

1186
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:56,111
<i>We will save him from himself

1187
01:36:56,840 --> 01:36:58,273
<i>We will save...

1188
01:37:04,200 --> 01:37:10,639
<i>We will save, we will save,
we will save another soul

1189
01:37:10,760 --> 01:37:14,435
<i>And if the road is rocky
and a man should start to slip

1190
01:37:14,680 --> 01:37:16,750
<i>Man should start to slip...

1191
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:19,872
- What'd he say?
- He says, uh...

1192
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:23,197
"Good to sign white squaw's paper.
Good for peace."

1193
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:31,908
<i>We will save, we will save,
we will save another soul

1194
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:35,589
<i>And if the road is rocky
and a man should start to slip

1195
01:37:36,160 --> 01:37:39,038
<i>Man should start to slip,
man should start to slip...

1196
01:37:50,720 --> 01:37:52,434
If it's the last thing I ever do,

1197
01:37:52,918 --> 01:37:55,748
I'll have that entire band
transferred to Alaska.

1198
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:03,076
- What are they doing now?
- Singing, sir.

1199
01:38:03,200 --> 01:38:06,317
- And signing pledges.
- I don't believe it.

1200
01:38:06,440 --> 01:38:08,954
As far as I can tell,
they've got 50 signed already.

1201
01:38:09,080 --> 01:38:13,232
Go back there, Sergeant. Get me
one of those pledges. I wanna see it.

1202
01:38:14,240 --> 01:38:16,196
How can I get one, sir?

1203
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,195
Yes, sir!

1204
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:26,190
<i>We will save, we will save,
we will save another soul

1205
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:30,150
<i>And if a man is saved,
there are others still to come...

1206
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:32,937
Can you handle the rest of this,
Louise?

1207
01:38:32,938 --> 01:38:34,635
You can count on me, Mrs. Massingale.

1208
01:38:34,760 --> 01:38:36,796
I'm gonna hand out
equipment to Group B.

1209
01:38:36,920 --> 01:38:38,876
Good luck, Cora.

1210
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:46,314
Here, sir. Just a crazy mark,
but each one of 'em's marked different.

1211
01:38:46,440 --> 01:38:48,908
That woman! How many?

1212
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:50,996
- 81 now, sir.
- 81?

1213
01:38:52,680 --> 01:38:55,831
Get back there, Buell.
And tell Slater to cover his flanks.

1214
01:38:55,960 --> 01:38:57,234
Yes, sir.

1215
01:38:58,200 --> 01:39:00,156
Chisel.

1216
01:39:01,280 --> 01:39:03,475
Axe.

1217
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:05,477
Hammer.

1218
01:39:08,840 --> 01:39:10,910
Where's that Massingale woman?

1219
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:15,158
She's down there somewhere, Frank,
takin' advantage of ignorant savages.

1220
01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:18,989
- There oughta be a law agin it.
- There oughta be somethin'

1221
01:39:19,120 --> 01:39:20,099
I don't trust her.

1222
01:39:20,300 --> 01:39:23,079
You just keep your pants hitched,
Frank.

1223
01:39:41,240 --> 01:39:44,391
Chief says..."No more peace."

1224
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:51,230
What is it, Sergeant?
What happened, Sergeant?

1225
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:53,590
- The Indians have captured the women.
- What?

1226
01:39:53,720 --> 01:39:56,393
One minute they were all
signing pledges and then...

1227
01:39:56,520 --> 01:39:58,715
How did that idiot Slater
ever let it happen?

1228
01:39:58,840 --> 01:40:01,957
On behalf of Captain Slater, sir,
it's only fair to state

1229
01:40:02,080 --> 01:40:07,234
that if the women hadn't started singing
hymns and making all that... racket...

1230
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:15,311
Sir, the Indians disarmed my men
and took the ladies captive.

1231
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:17,351
I know what they did, Slater.

1232
01:40:17,480 --> 01:40:21,109
They moved fast, we were outnumbered,
there was nothing I could do.

1233
01:40:21,240 --> 01:40:22,832
- Sergeant.
- Sir!

1234
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:25,679
Alert the bugler. Rouse the camp.
Prepare for battle.

1235
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:31,158
Yes, sir! Sir, any rash move on our part
may endanger the lives of the women.

1236
01:40:31,280 --> 01:40:34,511
- Dammit, I can't just twiddle my thumbs.
- No, sir!

1237
01:40:34,640 --> 01:40:36,631
Sir, the sergeant's right, sir.

1238
01:40:36,760 --> 01:40:40,389
An attack right now might be
most ill-advised... sir.

1239
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:45,794
- Why is he here?
- He's a symbol of their good faith.

1240
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:47,717
Good faith?

1241
01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:50,308
- They wanna bargain with us.
- Bargain?

1242
01:40:50,440 --> 01:40:53,750
20 wagons of whiskey
in exchange for the women.

1243
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:57,077
- 20 wagons?
- Yes, sir. You see, the Indians...

1244
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:02,234
- Can he understand us?
- Not a word, sir.

1245
01:41:02,360 --> 01:41:04,954
20 wagons comes out to about...

1246
01:41:05,960 --> 01:41:08,554
three and seven-eighths women
per wagon.

1247
01:41:08,680 --> 01:41:11,797
I think that was it, or maybe
the interpreter was confused.

1248
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:12,875
- Slater.
- Yes, sir.

1249
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:17,073
There's only one course of action now.
I am declaring martial law!

1250
01:41:19,360 --> 01:41:20,508
I say you can't do it!

1251
01:41:20,609 --> 01:41:24,354
No tinhorn colonel's gonna come
here and declare martial law.

1252
01:41:24,480 --> 01:41:27,631
If you don't shut up, Mr. Wallingham,
my first step will be to lock you up.

1253
01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:30,832
Gentlemen, this bickering
can lead to nothing constructive.

1254
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:34,270
Since you cannot take
military action against the Indians

1255
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:38,791
and you cannot negotiate with them, there
is only one course of action open to us.

1256
01:41:38,920 --> 01:41:42,708
We must accede to their demands
and give them the whiskey without delay.

1257
01:41:42,840 --> 01:41:45,115
Giving whiskey to Indians
is strictly forbidden

1258
01:41:45,240 --> 01:41:48,277
by the army regulations
so dear to you, Mrs. Massingale.

1259
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:50,630
Not if the Indians
don't drink the whiskey.

1260
01:41:50,760 --> 01:41:53,274
What's to stop the Indians
from drinking whiskey?

1261
01:41:53,400 --> 01:41:54,879
Precisely.

1262
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:58,117
I have their pledges.
One hundred signed pledges

1263
01:41:58,240 --> 01:42:02,279
with this one on the top signed by
Chief 5 Barrels himself. That's his mark.

1264
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:04,709
She's right. That's his mark.

1265
01:42:04,840 --> 01:42:06,558
Do they get the whiskey?

1266
01:42:06,680 --> 01:42:09,638
It's <i>my</i> whiskey, and you're not
going to touch one drop of it!

1267
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:11,591
- Listen, Frank...
- Quiet!

1268
01:42:11,720 --> 01:42:15,793
In that case, I have no choice but to
destroy all the whiskey right now.

1269
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:17,353
You're bluffin'

1270
01:42:17,480 --> 01:42:19,710
Oh...

1271
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:21,796
Am I?

1272
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:25,357
There is a woman hidden in each
and every one of those wagons,

1273
01:42:25,480 --> 01:42:29,758
awaiting my order by code to start
smashing the barrels of this vile cargo.

1274
01:42:29,880 --> 01:42:32,075
Madam, you lie.

1275
01:42:32,200 --> 01:42:33,838
Indeed?

1276
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:39,590
Ladies of Group B...

1277
01:42:42,760 --> 01:42:44,910
Frank, will you keep your pants hitched?

1278
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:48,759
The signal was to be a hymn,
but that's not necessary.

1279
01:42:48,760 --> 01:42:50,319
Now, I'll just tell them to begin.

1280
01:42:50,440 --> 01:42:53,910
- You wouldn't do that.
- Ladies of Group B, you may begin!

1281
01:42:54,040 --> 01:42:56,156
Puncture those barrels!

1282
01:42:56,280 --> 01:42:58,874
- No, wait!
- Just a moment, ladies!

1283
01:43:02,040 --> 01:43:03,739
You let her smash one barrel

1284
01:43:03,740 --> 01:43:07,239
and I'll have those brass buttons
ripped off your chest!

1285
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:10,830
- I'm a taxpayer and a good Republican!
- You say that one more time

1286
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:13,474
and I'll bust you right in the nose!

1287
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:16,114
- Are you threatening me?
- Now sit down!

1288
01:43:16,240 --> 01:43:19,596
- You hear that?
- Sit down! Come on, Frank. Sit down.

1289
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:25,110
And shut up!

1290
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:29,909
Mrs. Massingale, sit down.

1291
01:43:31,640 --> 01:43:33,596
Sit down!

1292
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:43,190
And stay down.

1293
01:43:56,840 --> 01:43:59,752
Ladies of Group B,
get out of those wagons!

1294
01:44:00,280 --> 01:44:02,236
Right now!

1295
01:44:14,720 --> 01:44:16,915
- Sergeant, put this down.
- Yes, sir.

1296
01:44:17,040 --> 01:44:21,272
The United States Army confiscates
20 wagons of the Wallingham train.

1297
01:44:21,400 --> 01:44:24,233
There! You hear that?
Confiscation of private property,

1298
01:44:24,360 --> 01:44:28,069
in which case I shall be repaid in full.
Go ahead, declare martial law.

1299
01:44:28,200 --> 01:44:31,636
- Martial law to take effect at daybreak.
- You declare it right now!

1300
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:34,558
Don't you tell me
when to declare martial law.

1301
01:44:35,480 --> 01:44:39,519
Slater. Take that symbol of good faith
back to Chief 5 Barrels.

1302
01:44:39,640 --> 01:44:42,234
And, Slater, knock down the price.

1303
01:44:46,760 --> 01:44:48,955
- Buell.
- Sir!

1304
01:44:49,080 --> 01:44:51,036
This meeting stands adjourned.

1305
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:01,159
Get outta here!

1306
01:45:01,280 --> 01:45:04,033
Go on! Get outta here,
you bunch of vandals!

1307
01:45:04,160 --> 01:45:06,116
Get off of my property!

1308
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:08,870
Get off of my bed! Get outta here!

1309
01:45:26,680 --> 01:45:29,990
Get outta that wagon! Get outta there!

1310
01:45:31,800 --> 01:45:33,756
Out! Out!

1311
01:45:49,160 --> 01:45:52,197
I thought I heard ya, Frank.
<i>(chuckles)</i>

1312
01:45:52,320 --> 01:45:53,230
He, he, he...

1313
01:45:53,360 --> 01:45:55,715
You got me into this,
you soothsaying sot.

1314
01:45:55,840 --> 01:45:59,799
And now I'll get you out of it, Frank.
In fact, it's all set.

1315
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:03,754
Everything's ready, except one
more chore I gotta do right now.

1316
01:46:03,880 --> 01:46:07,589
Believe me, Frank,
you just trust old Oracle.

1317
01:46:07,720 --> 01:46:10,393
Me and my Billy girl
is gonna fix it all up.

1318
01:46:11,040 --> 01:46:14,794
Come on now, Billy girl.
Take me slow and take me true.

1319
01:46:43,280 --> 01:46:45,236
Colonel?

1320
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:47,956
Go away!

1321
01:46:50,760 --> 01:46:52,830
Madam, I don't know what you're up to,

1322
01:46:52,960 --> 01:46:55,758
but whatever it is
I don't wanna hear about it.

1323
01:46:56,520 --> 01:46:59,637
I've come to tell you how truly sorry
I am for what I've done.

1324
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:02,035
Thank you, and good night.

1325
01:47:02,160 --> 01:47:04,390
Colonel, do you realise what will happen

1326
01:47:04,520 --> 01:47:08,672
when word gets out that you've given
20 wagons of whiskey to Sioux Indians?

1327
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:10,518
I realise!

1328
01:47:10,640 --> 01:47:14,076
20 wagons confiscated from
a taxpayer and a good Republican.

1329
01:47:14,200 --> 01:47:17,112
Don't you tell me what he is
or I'll bust <i>you</i> on the nose!

1330
01:47:17,240 --> 01:47:19,339
Colonel, those cords again.
Just let me...

1331
01:47:19,340 --> 01:47:21,438
Get away from my cords!

1332
01:47:21,560 --> 01:47:24,120
If you just relax
and let the blood flow...

1333
01:47:24,240 --> 01:47:26,390
My blood can flow on its own.

1334
01:47:28,200 --> 01:47:31,510
Mrs. Massingale, I don't know
what your plans are for tomorrow,

1335
01:47:31,640 --> 01:47:34,518
but judging from experience,
you'd better get some rest.

1336
01:47:34,640 --> 01:47:37,712
How can I rest
after what I've done to you?

1337
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:39,796
Try!

1338
01:47:56,920 --> 01:47:58,876
Oh...

1339
01:48:14,600 --> 01:48:18,275
My selfishness, my obstinacy,

1340
01:48:18,400 --> 01:48:21,073
my stupidity in not listening
to your advice.

1341
01:48:21,200 --> 01:48:22,918
I must agree with you.

1342
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:25,035
It's all my fault
you're in this position.

1343
01:48:25,136 --> 01:48:27,830
Well, crying isn't going to help.

1344
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:44,837
Mrs. Massingale...

1345
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:50,630
Mrs. Massingale!

1346
01:48:50,760 --> 01:48:52,716
You needn't look so shocked.

1347
01:48:53,640 --> 01:48:57,394
Plato, Augustus, Alexander...

1348
01:48:57,920 --> 01:49:02,357
even George Washington took
occasional spirits in medicinal amounts.

1349
01:49:04,160 --> 01:49:08,517
There's nothing wrong with limited
libation under emotional stress.

1350
01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:14,195
Your entire career is ruined!

1351
01:49:15,800 --> 01:49:18,917
Well... I suppose
there'll be some criticism.

1352
01:49:19,240 --> 01:49:21,470
Criticism? You'll be crucified!

1353
01:49:22,680 --> 01:49:25,797
The press, the public,
the War Department.

1354
01:49:26,600 --> 01:49:28,556
Horace Greeley.

1355
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:31,716
Oh...

1356
01:49:41,160 --> 01:49:43,196
Well, if I can save
the lives of 27 women, I...

1357
01:49:44,592 --> 01:49:46,632
I'd gladly sacrifice my career.

1358
01:49:46,760 --> 01:49:50,275
After all, what is it?
Only 19 years of service.

1359
01:49:50,760 --> 01:49:53,832
With Grant at Vicksburg.
With Thomas at Nashville.

1360
01:49:53,960 --> 01:49:57,111
17 Indian campaigns,
Laramie to Fort Hall.

1361
01:49:59,040 --> 01:50:00,996
One more year.

1362
01:50:01,720 --> 01:50:05,872
281 dollars and 25 cents a month,
pension.

1363
01:50:06,960 --> 01:50:10,635
Sergeant Buell,
27 dollars and 50 cents a month.

1364
01:50:12,080 --> 01:50:14,275
Every month.

1365
01:50:14,400 --> 01:50:16,356
19 years.

1366
01:50:18,360 --> 01:50:22,035
And all that time,
not once have I ever...

1367
01:50:22,160 --> 01:50:25,436
never have I ever met anyone like...

1368
01:50:25,960 --> 01:50:28,110
Like me?

1369
01:50:29,600 --> 01:50:32,876
Oh, well, I'll just resign gracefully.
Anyway, I'll resign.

1370
01:50:34,040 --> 01:50:36,679
Well, at least you'll still
have your beloved West.

1371
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:38,950
- I hate the West.
- Oh, dear!

1372
01:50:39,080 --> 01:50:41,435
Dust, wind, Indians.

1373
01:50:43,320 --> 01:50:47,677
My stubbornness, my obstinacy,
my selfishness.

1374
01:50:47,800 --> 01:50:50,109
Now, now, Cora... uh... Mrs. Massingale.

1375
01:50:50,240 --> 01:50:52,435
If only I'd listened to you. If only!

1376
01:50:52,920 --> 01:50:55,832
Easy, easy, Mrs. Massingale... Cora.

1377
01:50:55,960 --> 01:50:58,793
Do you think you could
ever forgive me, Thaddeus?

1378
01:50:59,920 --> 01:51:02,070
Well, I...

1379
01:51:14,040 --> 01:51:16,713
I could try.

1380
01:51:23,800 --> 01:51:25,756
Cora...

1381
01:51:26,480 --> 01:51:29,472
Couldn't we forget all this? I mean...

1382
01:51:31,360 --> 01:51:36,434
I mean... just forget
the whole thing... Cora?

1383
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:39,313
- Colonel Gearhart!
- One moment, Slater.

1384
01:51:49,560 --> 01:51:51,516
Come in, Slater.

1385
01:51:54,440 --> 01:51:59,673
- Captain Slater reporting, sir.
- <i>Stand up, we'll march to Denver</i>

1386
01:52:00,600 --> 01:52:04,149
- <i>No more wine or beer</i>
- Someone's singing. Go on, Slater.

1387
01:52:04,960 --> 01:52:07,554
Uh... Chief 5 Barrels
said he'd take 15 barrels.

1388
01:52:07,680 --> 01:52:09,875
I came back with eight and he said 13.

1389
01:52:10,560 --> 01:52:11,477
I think that was the number.

1390
01:52:11,978 --> 01:52:14,394
The language barrier is very difficult,
sir.

1391
01:52:14,520 --> 01:52:17,671
- Did you reach any agreement?
- 10 wagons of whiskey.

1392
01:52:17,800 --> 01:52:19,279
- 10 wagons?
- For all the women.

1393
01:52:19,400 --> 01:52:21,231
- Good work, Slater.
- Thank you, sir.

1394
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:25,273
- What's he doing here?
- The same, sir. A symbol of good faith.

1395
01:52:29,880 --> 01:52:32,348
Are you sure he can't understand us?

1396
01:52:32,480 --> 01:52:34,710
- Not a word.
- That's all, Slater.

1397
01:52:39,160 --> 01:52:43,790
Oh... The Indians
would like to have... uh...

1398
01:52:43,920 --> 01:52:46,992
Mrs. Massingale present
for the exchange, sir.

1399
01:52:49,040 --> 01:52:51,508
- What for?
- Our symbol of good faith.

1400
01:52:52,400 --> 01:52:56,075
Tell Chief 5 Barrels I'd be happy
to join my brave ladies.

1401
01:52:58,360 --> 01:53:02,433
Yes, ma'am. I'll make all
the arrangements for the exchange. sir.

1402
01:53:02,560 --> 01:53:04,790
Good night, Slater.

1403
01:53:04,920 --> 01:53:06,876
It's scheduled for dawn.

1404
01:53:13,840 --> 01:53:15,478
Oh...

1405
01:53:15,600 --> 01:53:18,319
Thaddeus, isn't it wonderful? 10 wagons.

1406
01:53:18,440 --> 01:53:21,238
That's the exact number
held by the Irish teamsters.

1407
01:53:21,360 --> 01:53:26,115
You're not gonna have to confiscate
any of Mr. Wallingham's wagons after all.

1408
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:28,836
Yes... well...

1409
01:53:28,960 --> 01:53:32,077
It's a long day tomorrow, Cora,
and you need rest.

1410
01:53:32,200 --> 01:53:34,156
I'll take you back to your camp.

1411
01:53:37,040 --> 01:53:39,838
- Oh...
- Oh, I can get back by myself.

1412
01:53:39,960 --> 01:53:43,350
- You're sure?
- Oh, Thaddeus...

1413
01:53:43,480 --> 01:53:47,758
You're so kind and generous... and brave.

1414
01:53:53,680 --> 01:53:55,636
Good night, Thaddeus.

1415
01:53:58,440 --> 01:54:02,069
<i>Stand up, we'll march to Denver

1416
01:54:02,440 --> 01:54:05,034
<i>No more wine or beer...

1417
01:54:15,360 --> 01:54:17,316
<i>We shall save

1418
01:54:18,120 --> 01:54:20,076
<i>We shall save

1419
01:54:20,960 --> 01:54:23,838
<i>We shall save another soul

1420
01:54:24,760 --> 01:54:27,228
- <i>Hallelujah</i>
- Frank.

1421
01:54:27,360 --> 01:54:29,396
- Huh?
- Frank, she's all fixed up.

1422
01:54:30,300 --> 01:54:31,000
What?

1423
01:54:31,296 --> 01:54:33,790
Frank, listen carefully.
This is important.

1424
01:54:33,920 --> 01:54:36,070
Frank! Hey, Frank!

1425
01:54:38,040 --> 01:54:40,031
You've been drinkin'

1426
01:54:40,160 --> 01:54:44,676
Frank, listen carefully. If you could
get your wagon train outta here,

1427
01:54:44,800 --> 01:54:47,016
if you could cross the river
so as nobody,

1428
01:54:47,017 --> 01:54:50,432
no Injuns, no women
or army could follow,

1429
01:54:50,560 --> 01:54:53,028
would you do it?

1430
01:54:53,160 --> 01:54:55,151
- How?
- Wait a minute!

1431
01:54:55,280 --> 01:54:58,238
You'd have to give up
them 10 wagons on the exchange.

1432
01:54:58,360 --> 01:55:01,238
Now, here's what we do.
We take the rest of the wagons

1433
01:55:01,360 --> 01:55:04,955
and we ride across Quicksand Bottoms.
None of them people could see us.

1434
01:55:05,080 --> 01:55:07,036
- Hold it.
- We'd get across the river...

1435
01:55:07,160 --> 01:55:10,072
Hold on! Just a damn minute now.

1436
01:55:10,200 --> 01:55:13,590
Nobody can cross Quicksand Bottoms
cos they'd sink.

1437
01:55:13,720 --> 01:55:16,917
We can. There's a way, Frank.

1438
01:55:17,040 --> 01:55:19,474
I found it five years ago.

1439
01:55:19,600 --> 01:55:23,957
A bunch of scalp-hungry Injuns
chased me right up to the edge.

1440
01:55:24,080 --> 01:55:27,356
I knew for sure they'd get me
that night if I didn't get across.

1441
01:55:27,480 --> 01:55:32,076
I just pointed my Billy girl south
and let her go. She didn't miss a step.

1442
01:55:32,680 --> 01:55:36,309
I did the same thing tonight.
She took me right across.

1443
01:55:36,720 --> 01:55:40,657
I've staked out a trail across
the Bottoms with my red flannel.

1444
01:55:40,958 --> 01:55:42,208
We can't miss it.

1445
01:55:42,920 --> 01:55:48,233
We'll take all the wagons you got and go
across, a-pullin' up the stakes as we go.

1446
01:55:48,360 --> 01:55:50,954
They won't even know
what happened to us.

1447
01:55:51,080 --> 01:55:56,234
Once across the Bottoms, it's a straight
shoot to Denver over flat, open country.

1448
01:55:56,360 --> 01:55:59,875
- We'll be free and clear.
- <i>(Wallingham chuckles)</i>

1449
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:04,198
- Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
- Sh! Hush up!

1450
01:56:04,640 --> 01:56:07,552
Yeah... My sentiments exactly.

1451
01:56:08,600 --> 01:56:10,556
Hallelujah.

1452
01:56:11,880 --> 01:56:13,836
Here's one.

1453
01:56:16,560 --> 01:56:18,516
Here's another one.

1454
01:56:22,720 --> 01:56:24,790
Here...

1455
01:56:24,920 --> 01:56:27,115
and here's one.

1456
01:56:27,240 --> 01:56:29,959
- But what are they?
- I don't know.

1457
01:56:30,080 --> 01:56:33,914
- But does it look familiar?
- It looks like Mr. Jones' underwear.

1458
01:56:34,040 --> 01:56:37,316
- It is.
- Are you... are you sure?

1459
01:56:37,440 --> 01:56:41,638
The ladies have confirmed it. He's not
wearing those underdrawers now.

1460
01:56:41,760 --> 01:56:46,959
They're torn to shreds and spread out
on stakes all across Quicksand Bottoms.

1461
01:56:48,280 --> 01:56:51,352
- Where's Group C?

1462
01:56:54,760 --> 01:56:57,718
Mrs. Massingale, have you any idea
what these stakes are for?

1463
01:56:57,840 --> 01:57:00,718
I'm not sure, but I know
what we're gonna do with them.

1464
01:57:00,840 --> 01:57:03,149
- What?
- Move them.

1465
01:57:33,720 --> 01:57:36,712
Stay between those red markers.
Don't be a-laggin' behind.

1466
01:57:36,840 --> 01:57:38,796
Keep your wagons up close, all of ya!

1467
01:57:38,920 --> 01:57:41,878
Militia, when we move out,
get on the wagons.

1468
01:57:44,280 --> 01:57:45,478
That's the signal, sir.

1469
01:57:46,210 --> 01:57:48,862
All wagons ready for exchange.
Platoons A and B in position.

1470
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:53,357
Get down there, Buell. Send Mrs.
Massingale over to the exchange point.

1471
01:57:57,240 --> 01:57:59,470
- Mrs. Massingale!
- Whoa, whoa!

1472
01:57:59,600 --> 01:58:02,910
- Mrs. Massingale, excuse me.
- I'm busy right now, Mr. O'Flaherty.

1473
01:58:03,040 --> 01:58:05,998
- It's about them 10 wagons.
- What's the matter with them?

1474
01:58:06,120 --> 01:58:09,715
- Nothing, mum, but they ain't whiskey.
- Ain't whiskey?

1475
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:13,674
No, mum. Those wagons is filled
with French champagne. All of 'em.

1476
01:58:13,800 --> 01:58:16,758
You know anything about
French champagne, mum?

1477
01:58:16,880 --> 01:58:20,077
Well, I sipped some once
on my second honeymoon in Paris.

1478
01:58:20,200 --> 01:58:23,590
Aye, but it was most likely cold.
These bottles ain't, they're warm.

1479
01:58:23,720 --> 01:58:28,032
If you open a bottle of warm champagne,
especially when it's been shooken up,

1480
01:58:28,160 --> 01:58:30,310
well, it's...

1481
01:58:31,400 --> 01:58:35,154
- You mean they explode?
- Like a Marsh gun, about a .58 calibre.

1482
01:58:35,280 --> 01:58:38,033
We gotta handle those bottles
like dynamite.

1483
01:58:38,160 --> 01:58:41,755
That's why they hired us Irish teamsters.
It's our business.

1484
01:58:41,880 --> 01:58:44,678
What's gonna happen when
them savages get them wagons?

1485
01:58:44,800 --> 01:58:47,030
What's gonna happen to that champagne?

1486
01:58:47,160 --> 01:58:49,151
- Explosions?
- Right.

1487
01:58:49,280 --> 01:58:51,271
I just thought someone oughta know.

1488
01:58:51,400 --> 01:58:55,518
- Have you told Colonel Gearhart yet?
- Oh, no, mum. I've been afeard to.

1489
01:58:55,640 --> 01:58:57,596
What's holding you up, Mrs. Massingale?

1490
01:58:57,720 --> 01:59:01,429
I'm sorry, Sergeant Buell.
Excuse me, Mr. O'Flaherty.

1491
01:59:14,240 --> 01:59:16,356
Mrs. Massingale,
we have a bit of a problem.

1492
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:19,040
Chief 5 Barrels insists on
taking the first wagon,

1493
01:59:19,160 --> 01:59:22,994
and his two brothers-in-law
the second and third wagons,

1494
01:59:23,120 --> 01:59:28,114
and Elks-Runner the fourth wagon. That
leaves nobody in charge on their side.

1495
01:59:28,240 --> 01:59:30,310
Me in charge.

1496
01:59:30,440 --> 01:59:34,479
You? You speak our tongue?

1497
01:59:34,600 --> 01:59:37,956
I speak with straight tongue.
Me in charge good. Drink later.

1498
01:59:38,080 --> 01:59:40,992
We'll agree to your taking charge
on one condition,

1499
01:59:41,120 --> 01:59:43,759
that I stay at the exchange point
the whole time.

1500
01:59:43,880 --> 01:59:46,348
- Me there... whole time.
- Good.

1501
01:59:48,200 --> 01:59:50,350
One moment, please, Captain.

1502
01:59:55,280 --> 01:59:58,636
Mrs. Massingale, I'll never forgive
myself for having failed you.

1503
01:59:58,760 --> 02:00:00,990
10 wagonloads of whiskey to the Indians.

1504
02:00:01,120 --> 02:00:04,430
- I've destroyed the crusade.
- Not quite yet.

1505
02:00:04,560 --> 02:00:06,710
- What?
- Give me a hatpin.

1506
02:00:08,440 --> 02:00:10,396
Hatpin?

1507
02:00:10,880 --> 02:00:13,917
Our goal is still in sight, Louise.
Courage, ladies!

1508
02:00:19,080 --> 02:00:21,640
First three ladies, front and centre.

1509
02:00:23,240 --> 02:00:26,391
There they go, sir.
Three women starting across...

1510
02:00:27,600 --> 02:00:29,716
- Sir... sir!
- What's the matter?

1511
02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:33,674
That Massingale woman.
She's heading for the exchange point.

1512
02:00:35,920 --> 02:00:39,196
- Why's that symbol of good faith there?
- I can't say, sir.

1513
02:00:43,880 --> 02:00:47,759
- Roll the first wagon.
- First wagon... roll!

1514
02:01:14,760 --> 02:01:18,116
What's he trying to do,
bolting out of there like that?

1515
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:23,198
- Roll wagon two.
- Wagon two... roll!

1516
02:01:24,920 --> 02:01:26,876
Ladies, move out!

1517
02:01:28,360 --> 02:01:30,828
Wagon two, roll!

1518
02:01:32,600 --> 02:01:34,875
Next three ladies, front and centre.

1519
02:01:52,880 --> 02:01:55,792
Tell 'em not to bolt like that.
Our teams'll get out of control.

1520
02:01:55,920 --> 02:01:58,070
Tell those Indians not to bolt like that.

1521
02:02:40,720 --> 02:02:43,678
- Roll wagon three.
- Wagon three, roll!

1522
02:02:45,840 --> 02:02:48,308
Roll!

1523
02:02:48,760 --> 02:02:51,035
Next three ladies, front and centre!

1524
02:02:54,200 --> 02:02:56,156
Well, move out. Go!

1525
02:03:16,840 --> 02:03:20,913
Don't let those idiots bolt that way.
Roll the wagons slowly!

1526
02:03:21,360 --> 02:03:23,874
No, not those wagons.
Hold those wagons back!

1527
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:27,709
Hold on to those teams! There's gonna
be a runaway! Hold 'em, I say!

1528
02:03:27,840 --> 02:03:31,799
Whoa! Somebody tell them Indians
not to go bolting out there like that!

1529
02:03:32,360 --> 02:03:35,272
Wagon four, roll!

1530
02:03:37,640 --> 02:03:41,394
Next three ladies, front and centre!
Hold the wagons back!

1531
02:03:53,040 --> 02:03:54,837
Hold those teams back!

1532
02:03:57,360 --> 02:03:59,794
- Hold those wagons!
- Hold those wagons!

1533
02:04:03,120 --> 02:04:05,076
Don't bolt!

1534
02:04:37,040 --> 02:04:38,758
- Hold 'em back!
- Hold 'em back!

1535
02:04:43,680 --> 02:04:46,672
Carter! Cut those teams off
and bring 'em back!

1536
02:04:46,800 --> 02:04:48,552
Ho!

1537
02:04:51,360 --> 02:04:52,952
Ho!

1538
02:05:20,040 --> 02:05:22,713
- Look out! Look out!
- We got a stampede!

1539
02:05:22,840 --> 02:05:24,796
Hold on to that team!

1540
02:05:24,920 --> 02:05:27,150
Don't let 'em follow them other horses!

1541
02:05:27,480 --> 02:05:29,311
No, not that way!

1542
02:05:32,920 --> 02:05:35,115
You're going the wrong way!

1543
02:05:35,240 --> 02:05:38,437
They're gonna stampede!
You'll never get 'em back!

1544
02:05:38,560 --> 02:05:40,516
Pull them up! Pull them up there!

1545
02:05:41,120 --> 02:05:44,874
Hey, you! Pull them up!
You're going the wrong way!

1546
02:05:58,120 --> 02:06:00,270
The whole Wallingham train!

1547
02:06:41,920 --> 02:06:43,876
Hey! Hey, you!

1548
02:06:44,640 --> 02:06:46,596
Turn 'em, turn 'em!

1549
02:06:49,120 --> 02:06:51,509
Head 'em back to the quicksands.

1550
02:07:50,160 --> 02:07:52,355
Uh... company, halt.

1551
02:08:09,960 --> 02:08:11,916
Whoa! Whoa!

1552
02:08:13,240 --> 02:08:16,198
Get 'em on through there!
Follow them red flags!

1553
02:08:18,920 --> 02:08:21,309
All right!
Follow them red flags as you go.

1554
02:08:21,440 --> 02:08:26,116
Stay right along in line with them.
Follow them little red flags there.

1555
02:08:39,840 --> 02:08:41,637
Follow them markers!

1556
02:08:59,760 --> 02:09:03,355
Stay right in line with them.
Follow them little red flags and...

1557
02:09:04,520 --> 02:09:06,954
Hey, you! No, not that way!

1558
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:15,911
Frank! Look out, Frank!

1559
02:09:18,120 --> 02:09:20,509
Whoa! Whoa!

1560
02:09:22,520 --> 02:09:26,195
Rafe, Rafe! Come over here
and give me a hand with this thing!

1561
02:09:28,520 --> 02:09:30,476
Help me up!

1562
02:09:33,400 --> 02:09:35,356
Get 'em outta here!

1563
02:09:36,320 --> 02:09:38,959
- OK, take 'em out!
- Take 'em outta here.

1564
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:41,796
Go on, take 'em out!

1565
02:10:16,680 --> 02:10:19,478
Tell the colonel
the Indians are firing on us!

1566
02:10:21,160 --> 02:10:23,116
Return fire!

1567
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,560
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

1568
02:13:39,840 --> 02:13:42,149
Don't shoot!

1569
02:13:54,680 --> 02:13:56,830
I beg your pardon!

1570
02:13:56,960 --> 02:13:58,996
What do you think you're doing to me?

1571
02:13:59,320 --> 02:14:01,595
My God! They've got Mrs. Massingale!

1572
02:14:11,440 --> 02:14:13,908
Sir! Sir, they're waving a flag of truce!

1573
02:14:15,040 --> 02:14:17,918
It's a woman's petticoat. Charge!

1574
02:14:28,720 --> 02:14:30,676
- Thaddeus!
- You!

1575
02:14:38,480 --> 02:14:41,199
We go home now.

1576
02:14:41,320 --> 02:14:44,676
- You speak my tongue?
- I speak with straight tongue.

1577
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:46,956
We go home, hunt buffalo.

1578
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,355
Peaceful Indian. Forget presents.

1579
02:14:51,600 --> 02:14:55,673
You hunt buffalo in peace.
You hunt deer of green forest in peace.

1580
02:14:55,800 --> 02:14:58,030
You go home in peace. But go home!

1581
02:15:06,760 --> 02:15:08,716
Oh...

1582
02:15:10,040 --> 02:15:12,190
Hey. Hey!

1583
02:15:13,120 --> 02:15:15,554
Hey! Hey!

1584
02:15:26,440 --> 02:15:28,396
Get 'em outta there.

1585
02:15:39,440 --> 02:15:42,318
Rafe! Rafe! Throw me that rope!

1586
02:15:42,440 --> 02:15:43,873
Yeah. Get a rope!

1587
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:47,879
Hold what you got, Frank. I'm a-comin'
I'll help ya. Hold what you got, Frank!

1588
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:49,956
I'll be right there with you.

1589
02:15:57,520 --> 02:15:59,476
Make it fast to that tree.

1590
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:10,991
Get the slack outta that line.

1591
02:16:11,320 --> 02:16:13,276
Tighten up on it.

1592
02:16:14,320 --> 02:16:16,595
Now, hold on that. Hold it! Hold it!

1593
02:17:09,440 --> 02:17:14,434
<i>Companies A and B of the cavalry
escorted the ex-temperance marchers

1594
02:17:14,560 --> 02:17:18,155
<i>back to their husbands and
hungry children at Fort Russell.

1595
02:17:18,640 --> 02:17:20,870
<i>It is to be assumed some time passed

1596
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:25,039
<i>before the Indians were able to
regain their customary composure.

1597
02:17:25,800 --> 02:17:30,191
<i>But it is known that the exploits
of their journey became tribal legend,

1598
02:17:30,320 --> 02:17:35,235
<i>to be told over and over again,
from generation to generation,

1599
02:17:35,800 --> 02:17:38,109
<i>with slight revisions.

1600
02:17:38,480 --> 02:17:42,314
<i>The Denver Free Militia dissolved,
never to march again.

1601
02:17:42,720 --> 02:17:47,032
<i>And, of course, the strike
of the Irish teamsters failed,

1602
02:17:47,160 --> 02:17:50,630
<i>and the Wallingham Freighting Company
went bankrupt,

1603
02:17:51,080 --> 02:17:53,230
<i>having no visible assets.

1604
02:17:54,360 --> 02:17:58,035
You know, Frank,
some Injuns told me once...

1605
02:17:58,160 --> 02:18:00,594
Reliable Injuns, Frank.

1606
02:18:00,720 --> 02:18:04,235
They said a Cheyenne brave
and his pony sunk right here,

1607
02:18:04,360 --> 02:18:06,999
and durned if they didn't ooze up again

1608
02:18:07,120 --> 02:18:10,556
just as natural-lookin'
and as pretty as you please.

1609
02:18:11,520 --> 02:18:13,476
Oh, they was dead, of course,

1610
02:18:13,600 --> 02:18:16,558
but right near the top
where you could grab easy.

1611
02:18:18,080 --> 02:18:20,958
It might be worth waitin' for, eh, Frank?

1612
02:18:21,760 --> 02:18:23,955
Frank?

1613
02:18:25,840 --> 02:18:28,229
There. You see?

1614
02:18:32,120 --> 02:18:35,192
<i>So ended the great disaster
at Quicksand Bottoms.

1615
02:18:35,920 --> 02:18:37,876
<i>Oh, yes. Mrs. Massingale.

1616
02:18:39,240 --> 02:18:44,360
<i>Cora Templeton Massingale retired from
participation in temperance movements.

1617
02:18:45,320 --> 02:18:48,039
<i>A military wedding was held
at Fort Russell.

1618
02:18:51,720 --> 02:18:55,998
<i>As it turned out,
it was a double wedding.

1619
02:18:59,160 --> 02:19:03,312
<i>A homestead claim was filed
by Mr. Jones and Mr. Wallingham

1620
02:19:03,440 --> 02:19:08,036
<i>on a piece of land encompassing
the entire Quicksand Bottoms area.

1621
02:19:21,840 --> 02:19:24,400
Frank? Frank.

1622
02:19:25,320 --> 02:19:26,639
- Frank!
- What?

1623
02:19:26,760 --> 02:19:28,796
Frank!

1624
02:19:44,200 --> 02:19:46,156
Come on. Pull, Frank.

1625
02:19:48,280 --> 02:19:50,236
Careful, careful, careful.

1626
02:20:10,760 --> 02:20:13,149
Oracle... Oracle.

1627
02:20:13,280 --> 02:20:15,236
Oracle. Oracle!

1628
02:20:15,640 --> 02:20:17,392
Oracle. Oracle.

1629
02:20:17,520 --> 02:20:20,956
<i>Hallelujah!

1630
02:20:21,080 --> 02:20:23,514
There! Now I see it!

1631

- Glory, hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

1632
02:20:32,400 --> 02:20:34,072
<i>It's not to be denied

1633
02:20:34,200 --> 02:20:37,476
<i>that there were occasional
re-emergences of whiskey kegs,

1634
02:20:37,600 --> 02:20:42,276
<i>which kept Mr. Jones
and Mr. Wallingham, uh... uh...

1635
02:20:42,720 --> 02:20:45,871
<i>quite content for a number of years.

1636
