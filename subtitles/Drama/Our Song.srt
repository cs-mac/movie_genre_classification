1
00:00:07,254 --> 00:00:09,222
<i>I thought I'd never see you again.
Episode 19.</i>

2
00:00:09,356 --> 00:00:10,220
Welcome.

3
00:00:10,357 --> 00:00:13,848
You guys had enough.
So rest for a few days.

4
00:00:13,993 --> 00:00:15,051
If you're a doctor...

5
00:00:15,195 --> 00:00:17,061
Now I'm the master of Taehaksa.

6
00:00:17,198 --> 00:00:19,757
I loved the man from Haneuljae.

7
00:00:19,899 --> 00:00:21,764
Lock her up right now!

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,166
Lock her up in a single cell,
so I don't see her around!

9
00:00:27,107 --> 00:00:28,471
Duke Seodong.

10
00:00:28,907 --> 00:00:31,672
It's me, Jang.
Do you see me?

11
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:33,574
I came all the way to Taehaksa,

12
00:00:33,714 --> 00:00:36,876
What? Rules of Taehaksa?
Prince's order?

13
00:00:37,015 --> 00:00:38,983
Are you suspecting us?

14
00:00:39,118 --> 00:00:40,676
Why don't you give my father a klin?

15
00:00:40,819 --> 00:00:43,286
This isn't sleezy easy place
like Haneuljae.

16
00:00:43,421 --> 00:00:45,286
Is it true that
you're not the master here?

17
00:00:45,423 --> 00:00:47,790
Doctor is the only one
who can get it right.

18
00:00:47,926 --> 00:00:49,086
Do not back off yourself, please!

19
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:50,388
What the hell are you doing?

20
00:00:50,528 --> 00:00:52,394
You must not use
the same way to them.

21
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:53,588
Method bribery?

22
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,791
I confer you Naesol in foreign affair.

23
00:00:56,933 --> 00:00:58,401
Psycho!

24
00:00:59,137 --> 00:01:02,105
Well done!
You're my daughter!

25
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,300
I only followed
the rules of Taehaksa.

26
00:01:06,244 --> 00:01:10,612
Now I understand your mean.

27
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:17,845
When we borrow Prince's power,
we have another authority.

28
00:01:18,487 --> 00:01:21,150
Then nobody will study
the nature in Taehaksa,

29
00:01:21,291 --> 00:01:25,158
Only general's power
and prince's power will remain.

30
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:28,855
Prince's power means
only people of Haneuljae.

31
00:01:28,998 --> 00:01:30,761
So even if you become the master,

32
00:01:30,899 --> 00:01:33,868
You'll be left with only Haneuljae.

33
00:01:34,603 --> 00:01:38,562
Yes, they will isolate themselves.

34
00:01:39,406 --> 00:01:43,173
So I'm trying to take longer way.

35
00:01:44,512 --> 00:01:49,073
If I want to different destination with general,
I must go different way.

36
00:01:49,216 --> 00:01:52,482
Does it has to be longer way?

37
00:01:54,621 --> 00:01:56,282
Please tell me.

38
00:02:01,128 --> 00:02:05,689
That's your choice.

39
00:02:13,873 --> 00:02:17,036
You'll do it, right?
You'll clear my false charge.

40
00:02:18,077 --> 00:02:21,535
You've merits
so they won't do anything.

41
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,648
Just do it!

42
00:02:22,781 --> 00:02:25,751
Yes, we'll help you.
Do it.

43
00:02:25,885 --> 00:02:27,546
We can'tjust undergo with it.

44
00:02:27,686 --> 00:02:30,450
I never thought that Taehaksa is like this.

45
00:02:30,589 --> 00:02:32,056
Same here.

46
00:03:01,317 --> 00:03:05,083
This is not right.
You should step forward.

47
00:03:05,221 --> 00:03:09,282
Jang doesn't know the situation and system.
It's dangerous.

48
00:03:09,925 --> 00:03:12,417
Plus engineers are still young,

49
00:03:12,562 --> 00:03:15,621
I'm worried
if their minds would change.

50
00:03:16,065 --> 00:03:20,330
Please step forward and stop Jang.

51
00:03:22,071 --> 00:03:23,536
I want to do this.

52
00:03:29,478 --> 00:03:31,342
Right, do it.

53
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:32,639
Doctor!

54
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,238
Do it.

55
00:03:34,783 --> 00:03:35,749
Yes.

56
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:39,241
You should stop him.

57
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:41,152
What in the world,

58
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,153
I want to see something.

59
00:03:44,693 --> 00:03:46,556
See something?

60
00:03:56,301 --> 00:03:57,564
Doctor!

61
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:01,568
This is Jang who is conferred as Naesol.

62
00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:05,668
I'll go in and greet her.

63
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:22,723
I'm Jang who is conferred as Naesol.

64
00:04:22,861 --> 00:04:26,125
You didn't refuse the order?

65
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:30,531
That's foolish!

66
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,532
Go out!

67
00:04:37,674 --> 00:04:40,234
If this isn't precise,
we've a problem.

68
00:04:40,377 --> 00:04:42,345
Precisely...

69
00:04:45,582 --> 00:04:47,846
I'd like to know the number of people
in Taehaksa.

70
00:04:47,985 --> 00:04:52,352
Who is in charge of each workshop
and how promote is done.

71
00:04:52,788 --> 00:04:53,948
It's all there.

72
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:58,659
Can't you tell me while you go around?

73
00:04:58,792 --> 00:05:00,556
I don't have the luxury now.

74
00:05:25,452 --> 00:05:26,920
Why did you call us?

75
00:05:30,456 --> 00:05:31,616
You guys can help me out.

76
00:05:31,758 --> 00:05:32,725
What is it?

77
00:05:32,859 --> 00:05:35,020
It's number of people
and their experience for all workhsops,

78
00:05:35,162 --> 00:05:37,822
Ask people and find out precisely.

79
00:05:37,964 --> 00:05:38,932
Alright.

80
00:05:39,065 --> 00:05:40,622
Is this all?

81
00:05:40,767 --> 00:05:41,734
Yes.

82
00:05:41,868 --> 00:05:43,631
I will help anything like this.

83
00:05:43,769 --> 00:05:45,329
Please get us back where we belong.

84
00:05:45,471 --> 00:05:48,133
Yeah, engineer Gomo and Mojin

85
00:05:48,273 --> 00:05:51,243
Can't go to their meeting yet.

86
00:05:51,377 --> 00:05:54,038
And Young and Soji haven't been
arranged their workshop.

87
00:05:54,179 --> 00:05:57,342
And we have no mission or position either.

88
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:10,051
Excuse...

89
00:06:13,431 --> 00:06:14,489
Excuse...

90
00:06:46,361 --> 00:06:47,828
The engineer who copied mine

91
00:06:47,963 --> 00:06:50,624
She's the head engineer
of metallurgy's sister.

92
00:06:50,765 --> 00:06:53,029
She became an engineer
not long she got here.

93
00:06:53,167 --> 00:06:57,035
Same in the dye workshop.
I think he's general's people.

94
00:06:57,172 --> 00:06:59,731
Dad said that people have good talent
and stayed too long.

95
00:06:59,873 --> 00:07:01,432
There are too many people
staying as engineers.

96
00:07:01,576 --> 00:07:03,544
That's the same as other workshop.

97
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:08,639
I get it. Find out in detail anyway.

98
00:07:08,783 --> 00:07:10,147
Alright.

99
00:07:19,024 --> 00:07:21,288
I feel like I'm a different person.

100
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:27,192
<i>Is it because you said
you want to see her alive?</i>

101
00:07:28,134 --> 00:07:29,691
<i>I got to see her again.</i>

102
00:07:29,835 --> 00:07:33,203
<i>I don't wanna see her like the past
when I was powerless.</i>

103
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,006
<i>Forget her. You can't see her again.
She's mine now.</i>

104
00:07:50,754 --> 00:07:52,120
It's been over a year!

105
00:07:52,257 --> 00:07:56,716
When will you develop it?
Get out if you don't have talent!

106
00:08:08,372 --> 00:08:10,532
Didn't you use our papers?

107
00:08:10,672 --> 00:08:12,471
It's all Soo's.

108
00:08:12,609 --> 00:08:13,576
Then why didn't you develop it?

109
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:15,372
Because we have no talent. Why?

110
00:08:15,512 --> 00:08:17,376
They don't support us.

111
00:08:17,513 --> 00:08:20,572
I asked them to bring many types of wood,
they won't.

112
00:08:20,716 --> 00:08:23,184
I asked them to make a machine,
they won't.

113
00:08:23,619 --> 00:08:27,076
Damn it! I should really quit this.

114
00:08:27,222 --> 00:08:30,386
I've been hassled over a year, damn it.

115
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:35,590
What happened?

116
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:38,198
Yes, all papers are imported.

117
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:41,096
So we have to pay Soo with a lot of gold.

118
00:08:41,236 --> 00:08:43,396
Prince Aja and general ordered us to

119
00:08:43,537 --> 00:08:48,702
Develop it but it's not that easy.

120
00:09:03,158 --> 00:09:04,623
May I have your name?

121
00:09:04,756 --> 00:09:06,019
I'm Makhae.

122
00:09:06,859 --> 00:09:10,226
You've been in metallurgy for 8 years?
And you're good at it.

123
00:09:10,762 --> 00:09:12,424
How did you?

124
00:09:12,564 --> 00:09:14,326
Your name is Jangbo?

125
00:09:15,167 --> 00:09:17,227
You've been here for 7 years.

126
00:09:20,472 --> 00:09:22,736
I'm Dolsye and 13 years, ok?

127
00:09:22,874 --> 00:09:26,435
13 years?
Why are you still engineer?

128
00:09:26,578 --> 00:09:28,738
Because I'm dumb, why?

129
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,141
Really dumb.

130
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,251
Bloody youngster comes in
and takes Naesol,

131
00:09:33,385 --> 00:09:36,149
Bro, you've been here
more than 10 years and still engineer.

132
00:09:36,287 --> 00:09:37,549
Why bother to live? Huh?

133
00:09:37,688 --> 00:09:42,557
Why? It's good to see
younsters doing things.

134
00:09:44,795 --> 00:09:48,458
Excuse me, Jang.
Dr. Wooyoung wants to see you.

135
00:09:56,306 --> 00:09:57,569
Did you want to see me?

136
00:09:57,907 --> 00:10:01,774
Doctors held a meeting what to do
with Haneuljae members.

137
00:10:03,412 --> 00:10:05,881
All of you need to take promotion test.

138
00:10:06,016 --> 00:10:08,984
That means you can't admit
the system of Dr. Mok.

139
00:10:09,118 --> 00:10:12,610
Including you,
all are taking promotion test.

140
00:10:13,656 --> 00:10:15,817
Yes, I will take it.

141
00:10:16,557 --> 00:10:19,424
Instead, engineers who were here for 10 years

142
00:10:19,561 --> 00:10:22,326
Let them take the test with us.

143
00:10:23,564 --> 00:10:24,428
What's the reason?

144
00:10:24,565 --> 00:10:26,123
There's no reason.

145
00:10:26,268 --> 00:10:28,735
I checked the number of people
and many of them

146
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:31,532
Were over 10 years
and still engineers.

147
00:10:32,973 --> 00:10:36,033
They have to be organized in any way.

148
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:41,646
You don't acknowledge my system.

149
00:10:43,383 --> 00:10:44,543
Let's do that!

150
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:48,553
Whoever doesn't pass
this promotion test,

151
00:10:48,688 --> 00:10:51,248
Leaves Taehaksa.

152
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:55,856
Whether they're Haneuljae
or experienced engineers.

153
00:11:02,401 --> 00:11:05,961
Yes, but please make it open test.

154
00:11:06,906 --> 00:11:09,568
- Open?
- Yes.

155
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:14,706
Alright, that would be clear.

156
00:11:25,457 --> 00:11:28,016
Oh, my buddha.
Oh, my buddha.

157
00:11:28,158 --> 00:11:29,524
Cut it out, dad.

158
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,821
I trusted him, I really did.

159
00:11:31,962 --> 00:11:34,429
He could have sacked me quietly.

160
00:11:34,565 --> 00:11:38,125
I'll be embarrassed
after test and get sacked.

161
00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:41,135
Oh, my. How can he do this to me?

162
00:11:41,271 --> 00:11:42,829
You can do it well.

163
00:11:42,973 --> 00:11:46,931
Do it well? My eyes are blurry
and I'm too old for that.

164
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:53,239
I thought Jang was rectifying here,
why is he killing us?

165
00:11:53,381 --> 00:11:55,043
That's what I'm saying...

166
00:11:55,183 --> 00:11:57,152
Jang would have no choice.

167
00:11:57,286 --> 00:11:59,652
So we have to help him with our talent.

168
00:11:59,788 --> 00:12:01,653
- How?
- Is it?

169
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,553
- No.
- I think so.

170
00:12:03,692 --> 00:12:06,752
That's why he asked for open test.

171
00:12:06,895 --> 00:12:08,555
Open embarrassment.

172
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:12,155
But why are experience engineers
doing with us?

173
00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:15,896
Maybe that's why he asked
us to do that.

174
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:20,200
Right, he'd have his idea.
Let's check it out.

175
00:12:20,641 --> 00:12:25,805
Don't go.
Just warm your body here.

176
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:28,005
They will wield him.

177
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:31,015
Jang can't do this.

178
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:36,817
Doctor, this will scatter
Haneuljae people.

179
00:12:41,059 --> 00:12:43,721
Jang, you can stop it now.

180
00:12:44,062 --> 00:12:47,520
This will make things harder for doctor.

181
00:12:47,665 --> 00:12:51,124
The situation will flow
as they wield,

182
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,635
I know you tried to raise our pride

183
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:56,830
So you asked for experienced engineers
to do it with us.

184
00:12:56,974 --> 00:13:00,342
That gave our bad impression to people

185
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:02,640
Who is nothing to do
with authority and us.

186
00:13:03,881 --> 00:13:06,850
I'm not saying I don't know
your will and provocation.

187
00:13:06,984 --> 00:13:09,144
Let's just wait for doctor.

188
00:13:10,888 --> 00:13:12,047
Jang!

189
00:13:12,622 --> 00:13:14,180
Please help me.

190
00:13:15,827 --> 00:13:17,294
What is it?

191
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:18,486
Don't you know?

192
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:20,995
I don't care you got
the trust from Prince.

193
00:13:21,131 --> 00:13:23,099
Why you touch us to do the test!

194
00:13:23,233 --> 00:13:26,202
What the hell do you think you are?

195
00:13:27,037 --> 00:13:29,004
I only followed the rule.

196
00:13:29,138 --> 00:13:31,504
You can't get promoted
for 10 years, I understand.

197
00:13:31,641 --> 00:13:33,905
Invention is not anyone can do.

198
00:13:34,444 --> 00:13:37,900
- What?
- Instead you have to be expert at it.

199
00:13:38,047 --> 00:13:40,208
What the hell are you saying!

200
00:13:40,349 --> 00:13:44,613
Anyway if you don't pass this test,
you all must leave here.

201
00:13:44,752 --> 00:13:46,219
I'm letting you know.

202
00:14:02,669 --> 00:14:03,932
Jang,

203
00:14:04,071 --> 00:14:07,233
Why did you make those engineers
to take test together?

204
00:14:07,374 --> 00:14:08,932
Is there any reason?

205
00:14:09,077 --> 00:14:11,944
I want to know what I'm suspecting.

206
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,274
Anyway we can't avoid test.

207
00:14:14,414 --> 00:14:16,881
Right, that would make us clean.

208
00:14:17,016 --> 00:14:20,383
Yes, we just have to
show them our talent.

209
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,384
Nobody should be failed.

210
00:14:30,929 --> 00:14:34,387
You heard Jang.
You get kicked out if you fail.

211
00:14:34,532 --> 00:14:35,590
So what?

212
00:14:35,735 --> 00:14:38,101
You always have stomache
before the big test.

213
00:14:38,237 --> 00:14:40,101
And we get wrong
what you know.

214
00:14:40,239 --> 00:14:43,002
If you do that, we have to say goodbye.

215
00:14:43,141 --> 00:14:46,201
So practice now.
Try harder.

216
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:48,607
Make a loop until I count to 10.

217
00:14:48,746 --> 00:14:50,213
That's...

218
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:53,010
- Start! 1, 2.
- Wait, wait.

219
00:14:53,151 --> 00:14:57,314
3, 4, 5, 6, 7,

220
00:14:57,453 --> 00:15:02,323
- 8, 9, 9 and half and half.
- Almost done.

221
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:03,425
10!

222
00:15:03,859 --> 00:15:05,122
Here!

223
00:15:05,261 --> 00:15:07,230
Little late. Again!

224
00:15:07,363 --> 00:15:09,127
Don't worry about me.

225
00:15:09,267 --> 00:15:11,529
Go to Sir Mack and do something.

226
00:15:11,668 --> 00:15:14,865
Don't worry, he's determined.

227
00:15:37,224 --> 00:15:40,888
Finally heaven has given me up.

228
00:16:12,392 --> 00:16:13,950
He is determined.

229
00:16:14,094 --> 00:16:17,153
I haven't seen him
working hard for long.

230
00:16:25,803 --> 00:16:27,361
Engineer Mack Dosoo!

231
00:16:36,513 --> 00:16:40,471
Be well, Haneuljae family.
Please don't forget me...

232
00:16:41,018 --> 00:16:43,282
What, what is this?

233
00:16:44,322 --> 00:16:49,190
It's just sad poem of regreting
the farewell.

234
00:16:50,026 --> 00:16:51,688
Engineer Mack!

235
00:16:52,028 --> 00:16:54,895
I'm trying to end everything now.

236
00:16:55,031 --> 00:16:58,593
I don't want to cause
any trouble to Haneuljae,

237
00:16:58,735 --> 00:17:00,202
I should...

238
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:10,201
I saw spirit in your pottery.

239
00:17:10,345 --> 00:17:13,542
Put it in your pottery.
That's it.

240
00:17:15,384 --> 00:17:20,548
It's related to our pride.
You must do it.

241
00:17:20,687 --> 00:17:23,555
I trust you will do this.

242
00:17:30,297 --> 00:17:31,959
I trust you, too.

243
00:17:32,902 --> 00:17:35,266
It depends on Haneuljae's pride.

244
00:17:39,006 --> 00:17:40,473
Trust.

245
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:56,784
The test will be in 15th at 9 o'clock.

246
00:17:57,824 --> 00:17:58,982
Ok.

247
00:17:59,124 --> 00:18:02,890
For Haneuljae's test,
engineer Gulchi will provide,

248
00:18:03,029 --> 00:18:06,087
For Taehaksa, I'll provide it.

249
00:18:06,231 --> 00:18:07,391
Alright.

250
00:18:07,533 --> 00:18:13,027
For my test, I ask you to give it to me.

251
00:18:17,476 --> 00:18:18,534
I see.

252
00:19:10,224 --> 00:19:11,590
Start now!

253
00:19:12,426 --> 00:19:16,192
The test will be held in court.
Let's go to court.

254
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:21,000
It's not practical.

255
00:19:21,135 --> 00:19:22,397
Right.

256
00:19:50,562 --> 00:19:53,929
Have a seat where your name is on.

257
00:19:55,968 --> 00:19:58,128
It's about your specialty.

258
00:19:58,269 --> 00:20:01,136
Draw what you're asked.

259
00:20:03,473 --> 00:20:05,441
How many were there annually?

260
00:20:05,576 --> 00:20:07,237
Never.

261
00:20:07,678 --> 00:20:10,341
It'll start with the sound of bell.

262
00:20:10,481 --> 00:20:11,948
Please ring it.

263
00:20:29,131 --> 00:20:31,293
Why are you sitting at my seat?

264
00:20:31,434 --> 00:20:34,198
- Look at your name, here.
- Mack Do...

265
00:20:34,338 --> 00:20:37,305
It's here, here.

266
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:37,490
- This...
- Go.

267
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,391
Please do the open grading, too.

268
00:21:44,635 --> 00:21:47,697
Impartiality doesn't guarantee
without open grading.

269
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:49,999
Please do the open grading, too.

270
00:21:54,645 --> 00:21:56,703
I get it, but how?

271
00:21:56,847 --> 00:21:59,815
The head engineers of
each workshop come front please.

272
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,417
Sit on the engineers seat,

273
00:22:05,555 --> 00:22:08,718
And simply answer the question.

274
00:22:12,295 --> 00:22:16,060
I made a question with
what was invented in workshop.

275
00:22:16,198 --> 00:22:19,362
So simply draw your answer please.

276
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,674
Do that!

277
00:22:32,113 --> 00:22:33,979
- Do it.
- Yes.

278
00:22:34,516 --> 00:22:36,381
Proceed now.

279
00:22:36,517 --> 00:22:37,677
Yes.

280
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:29,167
Grade the answers.

281
00:23:30,801 --> 00:23:32,962
I have two drawings here.

282
00:23:33,103 --> 00:23:37,666
One is the same as original
and another one is yours.

283
00:23:37,809 --> 00:23:40,675
If two drawings match,
there's no problem.

284
00:23:40,811 --> 00:23:44,076
If not, one is copied or stolen.

285
00:23:44,915 --> 00:23:46,473
Please start.

286
00:23:53,023 --> 00:23:54,081
Same.

287
00:23:56,626 --> 00:23:57,593
Next.

288
00:24:02,932 --> 00:24:04,091
Correct.

289
00:24:04,433 --> 00:24:05,400
Next.

290
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,131
It's different.

291
00:24:14,975 --> 00:24:18,240
Who is Eunjin?
Answer is wrong!

292
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:21,940
It is not.
I drew it right.

293
00:24:22,082 --> 00:24:23,140
Really?

294
00:24:24,585 --> 00:24:26,747
Bring the original draft!

295
00:24:41,001 --> 00:24:42,367
It's the same.

296
00:24:45,004 --> 00:24:46,561
How did it happen?

297
00:24:49,708 --> 00:24:52,575
Engineer Soyoung copied it.

298
00:24:52,711 --> 00:24:54,372
Confess.

299
00:24:55,714 --> 00:25:00,174
I drew what I reflected.

300
00:25:04,923 --> 00:25:07,084
- Mark it.
- Yes.

301
00:25:10,528 --> 00:25:11,586
Next.

302
00:25:12,664 --> 00:25:14,029
Same.

303
00:25:14,167 --> 00:25:15,132
Next.

304
00:25:15,267 --> 00:25:16,233
It's different.

305
00:25:16,367 --> 00:25:17,925
How did it happen?

306
00:25:18,769 --> 00:25:20,031
Mark it.

307
00:25:26,978 --> 00:25:28,239
It's different.

308
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,838
Mine is correct!

309
00:25:31,582 --> 00:25:33,743
This part and this part is different.

310
00:25:33,884 --> 00:25:37,149
Engineer Dolsye drew it right.

311
00:25:37,287 --> 00:25:39,255
This invention is very new,

312
00:25:39,389 --> 00:25:41,549
And I know you got a lot
of points for this.

313
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:42,554
What are you saying?

314
00:25:42,691 --> 00:25:44,853
Are you sure you made this?

315
00:25:44,995 --> 00:25:48,259
What! Are you insulting me?

316
00:25:51,901 --> 00:25:55,359
So you think a few engineers

317
00:25:55,503 --> 00:25:59,565
Reported what they haven't made.

318
00:25:59,707 --> 00:26:00,766
Yes.

319
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:03,174
Method bribery is in place?

320
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:04,278
Yes.

321
00:26:04,413 --> 00:26:06,380
That's not possible.

322
00:26:06,513 --> 00:26:09,176
If it does, I'll abandon them!

323
00:26:13,353 --> 00:26:16,517
Has anyone bribed your method?

324
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:19,525
Has anyone?

325
00:26:21,361 --> 00:26:22,623
No.

326
00:26:24,064 --> 00:26:26,430
Has anyone bribed your method?

327
00:26:26,567 --> 00:26:28,534
I didn't intentionally do it.

328
00:26:28,668 --> 00:26:31,535
My idea was reported
without knowing it.

329
00:26:34,774 --> 00:26:39,143
You can tell me.
Has anyone done method bribery?

330
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:40,245
We've never done it.

331
00:26:40,379 --> 00:26:43,143
Did head engineer steal your invention?

332
00:26:43,281 --> 00:26:44,338
No.

333
00:26:45,784 --> 00:26:47,547
This is wrong.

334
00:26:47,687 --> 00:26:49,552
If you invented yourself,
it's your merit.

335
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:52,350
If everyone assisted,
it's everyone's merit.

336
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:55,550
It's not because name
and honor are important.

337
00:26:55,694 --> 00:26:58,254
You have to do this
to put your heart into study.

338
00:26:58,396 --> 00:27:00,659
We're meant to do that.

339
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:04,564
Has anyone done method bribery?

340
00:27:07,605 --> 00:27:08,470
We've never done it.

341
00:27:08,606 --> 00:27:11,269
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

342
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:22,614
Anyone can tell me.
I'll get your merit back.

343
00:27:22,753 --> 00:27:24,812
I'll get your name back.

344
00:27:30,761 --> 00:27:34,719
You've done it more than 10 years.
You're still an engineer.

345
00:27:34,863 --> 00:27:37,731
Come on, tell them!

346
00:27:37,868 --> 00:27:39,834
What are you afraid of?

347
00:27:39,968 --> 00:27:41,333
Tell them.

348
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:44,928
Taehaksa shouldn't be like this.

349
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:55,848
Only one person got stolen her method.

350
00:27:56,183 --> 00:28:00,552
Only Haneuljae people are telling me
there was bribery.

351
00:28:27,046 --> 00:28:31,813
You drove Taehaksa to currupted group.

352
00:28:33,552 --> 00:28:38,012
Neverthless, I'll leave Haneuljae people
who passed the test.

353
00:28:38,156 --> 00:28:43,719
You're responsible for me
and Taehaksa's disgrace.

354
00:28:43,861 --> 00:28:47,627
From now on, you no longer
perform your position.

355
00:28:48,266 --> 00:28:51,325
I'll deliver my mean to Prince Aja.

356
00:28:59,076 --> 00:29:01,442
He's bright but still young.

357
00:29:01,577 --> 00:29:05,639
That's right.
He thought expose will do the rest.

358
00:29:05,782 --> 00:29:08,443
We're not that easy.

359
00:29:09,385 --> 00:29:12,947
What about Mok?
Is he still in storage?

360
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:14,148
Yes.

361
00:29:15,191 --> 00:29:16,658
What a fox.

362
00:29:20,096 --> 00:29:24,156
Nobody admitted it
so Jang has to resign it.

363
00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:27,360
For this, Taehaksa is very confused.

364
00:29:27,503 --> 00:29:29,471
He wouldn't have done it
without an idea.

365
00:29:29,605 --> 00:29:31,368
But no one comes out,

366
00:29:31,506 --> 00:29:34,373
He wanted to change the Taehaksa.

367
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:38,372
But Wooyoung will gain more vigor.

368
00:29:38,813 --> 00:29:41,781
What's Dr. Mok's intention?

369
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,979
They have maintained
the group without us for 10 years.

370
00:29:47,121 --> 00:29:50,089
Did you think they will collapse
for your one exposure?

371
00:29:50,424 --> 00:29:52,891
People don't change their mind easily.

372
00:29:53,026 --> 00:29:55,186
Nor the group will.

373
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:59,390
So is this the end of what you tried?

374
00:30:00,034 --> 00:30:01,194
Doctor!

375
00:30:01,835 --> 00:30:03,996
There's nothing except Prince.

376
00:30:04,137 --> 00:30:06,196
Doctor, why are you doing this?

377
00:30:09,842 --> 00:30:11,205
What is it? Doctor.

378
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:14,141
What is that you're willing to see?

379
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:18,841
My power! I want to see my power.

380
00:30:21,686 --> 00:30:23,847
I'm not weird person.

381
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:26,651
How are you gonna live
in Taehaksa now?

382
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:29,954
But we're acknowledge
because of Jang.

383
00:30:30,095 --> 00:30:32,063
Acknowledgment is not important.

384
00:30:32,197 --> 00:30:35,563
They ignore us
and treat us like insects.

385
00:30:35,699 --> 00:30:37,859
It's scarier and shaking.

386
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:40,766
It's comfortable looking at their sign.

387
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:43,064
Right, I can't live like this.

388
00:30:43,206 --> 00:30:44,571
We have to live together.

389
00:30:44,707 --> 00:30:47,677
If we have to stay here,
that's better for us.

390
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:50,975
Now we can sleep in peace,
what's the matter?

391
00:30:51,114 --> 00:30:53,173
You have no one else to lookout,

392
00:30:53,316 --> 00:30:56,979
And with your audacity,
you can deal with it, Not us.

393
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,577
I'll be dead silent.
Let's not gather like this anymore.

394
00:31:00,722 --> 00:31:02,088
- Right.
- Yes.

395
00:31:02,224 --> 00:31:05,683
He saved you
when you were dying.

396
00:31:32,686 --> 00:31:34,655
I saw your eyes last night.

397
00:31:34,788 --> 00:31:35,653
What?

398
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:37,654
They were shaking.

399
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:39,652
What the hell.

400
00:31:39,794 --> 00:31:42,353
I'm not telling you to do big thing.

401
00:31:42,896 --> 00:31:46,263
Things that I made become mine,
and seeing people use it,

402
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:49,766
You may want to make better one.

403
00:31:51,004 --> 00:31:53,164
Hey! Get rid of him.

404
00:32:00,012 --> 00:32:03,070
I'll come back tomorrow.
Think about it.

405
00:32:03,214 --> 00:32:05,182
Why are you doing this?

406
00:32:06,018 --> 00:32:08,077
I'm trying to convince you.

407
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,584
You've gone insane.

408
00:32:09,721 --> 00:32:11,882
I want to put a mask on.

409
00:32:12,023 --> 00:32:15,720
Get your mind set, Jang!

410
00:32:15,859 --> 00:32:17,521
Jang!

411
00:32:20,865 --> 00:32:24,323
Have you given it pleasantly?
If so, I will go.

412
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:25,729
Stop it.

413
00:32:25,869 --> 00:32:29,635
You put your heart into it
without any bad feeling?

414
00:32:29,773 --> 00:32:31,638
Then I'll go.

415
00:32:32,276 --> 00:32:37,839
Our identities aren't good
but I'm just happy to work here.

416
00:32:37,981 --> 00:32:40,847
No, it shouldn't be like that at all.

417
00:32:41,184 --> 00:32:43,550
Heaven has given your talent without identity,

418
00:32:43,686 --> 00:32:45,847
Therefore Taehaksa has to be
equal for everyone.

419
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:49,655
I thought it was like that when I first came in.

420
00:33:04,306 --> 00:33:06,671
Why are you blocking other people?

421
00:33:06,807 --> 00:33:09,072
Why are you afraid of
getting acknowledged?

422
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:12,603
You're a coward.
You should be ashamed of yourself!

423
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:21,112
I will never give up.
You can't defeat me.

424
00:33:41,574 --> 00:33:42,734
Young master!

425
00:33:43,476 --> 00:33:45,136
Please have a seat here.

426
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,342
Are you alright?

427
00:33:49,481 --> 00:33:51,039
I feel like tired.

428
00:33:51,183 --> 00:33:53,446
Then why did you come out?

429
00:33:53,684 --> 00:33:57,347
Until Goosan comes,
please take a rest.

430
00:33:57,489 --> 00:33:59,047
Alright.

431
00:33:59,192 --> 00:34:02,159
How the hell did you come to here?

432
00:34:02,293 --> 00:34:03,851
Do you know something?

433
00:34:03,995 --> 00:34:05,360
Frankly...

434
00:34:06,597 --> 00:34:09,258
Frankly, Princess came to Haneuljae,

435
00:34:09,399 --> 00:34:12,391
Ordered us not to chase Jang
who was carrying you.

436
00:34:12,535 --> 00:34:14,902
What? Pricness did!

437
00:34:35,758 --> 00:34:37,919
It shouldn't go for long.

438
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:41,517
What if it gets exposed,
what would you do?

439
00:34:43,364 --> 00:34:46,732
Lord, please calm down.

440
00:34:49,871 --> 00:34:51,634
She went out with Baekjae person,

441
00:34:52,273 --> 00:34:54,638
Surely she was seeing Baekjae person?

442
00:34:54,776 --> 00:34:58,232
Yes, he's the engineer of Haneuljae.

443
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,949
And Princess helped him to escape?

444
00:35:02,083 --> 00:35:06,348
Yes, notjust escape.
They lived together for a while.

445
00:35:08,688 --> 00:35:10,349
How did she know him?

446
00:35:10,489 --> 00:35:12,684
He was the guy of Sedongyo,

447
00:35:12,826 --> 00:35:16,283
And he used to be
her guard for a while.

448
00:35:18,632 --> 00:35:20,496
And Kim Saheung knew all of these?

449
00:35:20,633 --> 00:35:23,898
Yes, his second son tried to pacify it

450
00:35:24,035 --> 00:35:27,403
So he ordered us to be silent.

451
00:35:32,844 --> 00:35:35,712
Didn't you go to meet Giroo?

452
00:35:35,848 --> 00:35:37,212
We have a problem.

453
00:35:37,348 --> 00:35:38,406
What is it?

454
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:41,917
I didn't know our man is
close to Wie's man.

455
00:35:42,053 --> 00:35:44,520
So? What happened?

456
00:35:44,656 --> 00:35:47,123
I think he talked princess...

457
00:35:47,257 --> 00:35:48,315
What?

458
00:35:51,162 --> 00:35:52,026
Sir.

459
00:35:52,163 --> 00:35:53,424
What is it?

460
00:35:53,564 --> 00:35:58,934
All of asristocrats from Seorabul are
coming to palace.

461
00:36:01,771 --> 00:36:04,638
What? They escaped and lived together?

462
00:36:04,775 --> 00:36:07,642
I'm very sorry to alert,

463
00:36:07,778 --> 00:36:09,540
But it is true.

464
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:11,043
Plus when soldiers pursued them,

465
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:14,479
She tried to kill herself to save him.

466
00:36:15,618 --> 00:36:17,881
So what can we do it?

467
00:36:18,019 --> 00:36:20,488
The rumor is spreaded all over the city.

468
00:36:23,926 --> 00:36:26,689
It's ashamed if he's Silla person.

469
00:36:26,828 --> 00:36:28,796
He is Baekjae person.

470
00:36:29,131 --> 00:36:30,996
This is really shameful.

471
00:36:31,133 --> 00:36:34,295
You got it all wrong.

472
00:36:34,435 --> 00:36:36,494
Since she took a job in Naesung...

473
00:36:36,638 --> 00:36:40,005
You knew everything about this!

474
00:36:41,142 --> 00:36:43,508
You found it out through your son,

475
00:36:43,643 --> 00:36:46,704
And you knew he is
the person of Seodongyo incident.

476
00:36:46,846 --> 00:36:49,406
Why didn't you report it to the King?

477
00:36:49,849 --> 00:36:53,911
Is that true?
You knew all about it?

478
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:56,713
When Princess and the man escaped,

479
00:36:56,856 --> 00:37:00,019
It was his men
who pursued them.

480
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:05,324
What? Did you really
know about this?

481
00:37:07,867 --> 00:37:12,166
The reason why the rumor is spreaded
is because of his men.

482
00:37:14,207 --> 00:37:18,575
You despised not only king
but whole imperial!

483
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:20,370
Is that true?

484
00:37:22,113 --> 00:37:24,673
Is Princess Chunmyung
telling the truth?

485
00:37:24,816 --> 00:37:26,784
No question is needed.

486
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:30,877
Palace and market are so noisy,
as well as Hwarang.

487
00:37:36,527 --> 00:37:38,893
You should lock him up.

488
00:37:43,134 --> 00:37:47,296
The rumor is so disgraceful that
I can't believe it.

489
00:37:47,437 --> 00:37:50,895
It must not be true, isn't it?

490
00:37:51,241 --> 00:37:53,105
Please kill us.

491
00:37:53,242 --> 00:37:56,701
They lived together,
is it true?

492
00:38:24,004 --> 00:38:27,565
What drove you so reckless!

493
00:38:31,312 --> 00:38:34,474
It's out of my hand now!

494
00:38:34,615 --> 00:38:37,481
How can I do! How!

495
00:38:45,058 --> 00:38:46,526
Have you been well?

496
00:38:46,627 --> 00:38:49,595
Brother, your waist is bad
so I can...

497
00:38:50,129 --> 00:38:51,494
He didn't come.

498
00:38:51,631 --> 00:38:52,996
Didn't come?

499
00:38:53,633 --> 00:38:55,999
He's been too hassled
so he won't come to work.

500
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:00,598
That's good.

501
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:04,404
His waist isn't well
so I can massage him.

502
00:39:07,646 --> 00:39:10,410
Do you how many people absent
because of you?

503
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:14,210
They informed me that
they won't come to work for a while.

504
00:39:21,258 --> 00:39:24,421
Here, I drew this.

505
00:39:24,561 --> 00:39:27,122
I told you I won't look at your stuff.

506
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:31,222
If you don't look,
who will look at mine?

507
00:39:31,368 --> 00:39:34,236
Report it to Dr. Wooyoung directly!

508
00:39:34,371 --> 00:39:36,736
Is this because of the last time?

509
00:39:36,873 --> 00:39:39,535
If so, I'm really sorry.

510
00:39:39,676 --> 00:39:41,233
You guilty people are still digging up.

511
00:39:41,377 --> 00:39:43,936
You're always asking the engineers.

512
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:47,537
That's not me.
I don't do that.

513
00:39:48,184 --> 00:39:50,846
Aren't you guys
tenacious Haneuljae people?

514
00:39:51,987 --> 00:39:53,648
I, I...

515
00:39:57,192 --> 00:39:58,750
She won't accept it?

516
00:39:58,894 --> 00:40:03,057
Since engineer does that,
other comrades won't talk to me.

517
00:40:03,197 --> 00:40:05,860
Same here.
They won't reply back.

518
00:40:06,001 --> 00:40:07,968
It makes me tired.

519
00:40:08,102 --> 00:40:09,467
That's same as me, but

520
00:40:09,603 --> 00:40:14,006
So please stop him.
Jang never gives up so they do to us.

521
00:40:14,141 --> 00:40:16,005
But he's trying hard.

522
00:40:16,141 --> 00:40:18,907
What hard? I got to live first.

523
00:40:19,647 --> 00:40:23,412
Since we came here.
We can just live quietly.

524
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:26,910
Even doctor is quiet
and why is he doing it!

525
00:40:27,754 --> 00:40:31,416
Calm donw,
I'll find him and talk with my dad.

526
00:40:36,061 --> 00:40:37,120
Jang,

527
00:40:38,864 --> 00:40:39,922
Stop it.

528
00:40:40,065 --> 00:40:45,128
I was wrong
if they will change their mind easily.

529
00:40:45,269 --> 00:40:46,931
But it already happened.

530
00:40:47,072 --> 00:40:49,835
If I stop now,
their mind will shut down even more.

531
00:40:49,974 --> 00:40:51,635
And they won't trust us.

532
00:40:51,777 --> 00:40:53,745
You shouldn't do that.

533
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:58,144
I have to convince them
until they trust me and my heart.

534
00:40:58,282 --> 00:40:59,544
At least one person.

535
00:40:59,684 --> 00:41:01,845
What about Haneuljae family?

536
00:41:01,986 --> 00:41:04,249
They can't even talk
and live in cold situation,

537
00:41:04,387 --> 00:41:06,550
What about them?

538
00:41:07,792 --> 00:41:09,157
Please help me.

539
00:41:11,595 --> 00:41:14,290
That's what Dr. Mok kept for long.

540
00:41:14,431 --> 00:41:15,591
Jang!

541
00:41:19,735 --> 00:41:23,501
Mom! Did you talk to Jang?

542
00:41:24,241 --> 00:41:25,709
He doesn't listen.

543
00:41:26,443 --> 00:41:30,105
I can't take it anymore.
It's too hard.

544
00:41:31,046 --> 00:41:35,312
Either I beat him
or I have to say I'm dying.

545
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:38,420
Bumro and his dad will
go and talk to him.

546
00:41:38,553 --> 00:41:40,112
You have to come with me, mom.

547
00:41:40,756 --> 00:41:42,018
Let's go.

548
00:41:49,864 --> 00:41:54,028
It's so noisy because of Haneuljae.
I put more for this time.

549
00:41:54,168 --> 00:41:56,637
Yes, thank you.

550
00:42:02,576 --> 00:42:04,339
What are you doing here?

551
00:42:04,477 --> 00:42:06,241
I said what are you doing here!

552
00:42:11,485 --> 00:42:13,180
What is this?

553
00:42:15,121 --> 00:42:16,782
Is this it?

554
00:42:18,825 --> 00:42:21,487
You sold your name for this?

555
00:42:26,031 --> 00:42:28,796
How much is it?

556
00:42:28,935 --> 00:42:32,893
All the machines that you thought and drew,

557
00:42:33,038 --> 00:42:35,302
How much does it cost to buy?

558
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:39,001
People get to smile with your machine,

559
00:42:39,143 --> 00:42:41,202
And they thank you for it.

560
00:42:41,746 --> 00:42:44,715
How much is it to replace that?

561
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:50,310
How much is it to replace your name
on Baekjae Singi?

562
00:42:50,654 --> 00:42:52,519
I'll buy it all.

563
00:42:53,057 --> 00:42:56,219
I'll tell Prince and buy it all!

564
00:42:56,559 --> 00:42:59,825
Who are you threatening to name Prince?

565
00:43:06,569 --> 00:43:09,436
Take care of him quietly.

566
00:43:09,572 --> 00:43:10,732
Yes.

567
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:26,481
What are you doing?

568
00:43:26,622 --> 00:43:27,678
- Hit him!
- No!

569
00:43:27,822 --> 00:43:29,084
It's dangerous, Ms Mojin.

570
00:43:29,223 --> 00:43:33,683
- If you ever touch him a bit
- I'll kill all of you!

571
00:43:34,328 --> 00:43:36,694
You got the wrong people!

572
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:39,698
You can never win this fight!

573
00:43:39,933 --> 00:43:41,595
Do you know why?

574
00:43:41,736 --> 00:43:43,599
Jang does what he's got to do.

575
00:43:43,737 --> 00:43:47,504
I scolded him for 10 years
but he never stopped what he wants!

576
00:43:48,442 --> 00:43:50,500
Do you know the second reason?

577
00:43:50,644 --> 00:43:52,407
We're next to him!

578
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:57,108
We know Jang is right
and we'll never leave him alone!

579
00:43:57,751 --> 00:44:00,116
Right! We'll never leave him alone!

580
00:44:01,655 --> 00:44:04,419
What the hell! You wanna die!

581
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:09,522
Let's go.

582
00:44:13,799 --> 00:44:15,265
You four there!

583
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:18,166
Shh! Nothing but cowards,

584
00:44:18,704 --> 00:44:20,262
Are you hurt...

585
00:44:21,206 --> 00:44:23,070
There you are.

586
00:44:23,508 --> 00:44:25,373
This is him, grandma.

587
00:44:26,511 --> 00:44:29,571
Grandma wants to ask you something.

588
00:44:29,714 --> 00:44:31,476
Go on.

589
00:44:33,016 --> 00:44:34,575
You know...

590
00:44:36,422 --> 00:44:40,686
Can little technique leave
my name on the book?

591
00:44:41,024 --> 00:44:46,484
Of course, this man will do
whatever he needs to do.

592
00:44:47,330 --> 00:44:53,395
Honestly I've been starched clothes
for 30 years here.

593
00:44:53,936 --> 00:44:58,306
It can be nothing
but I have 10 years old riped starch.

594
00:44:58,441 --> 00:45:02,399
I thought it'd be nice to make papers.

595
00:45:02,544 --> 00:45:06,310
But Taehaksa seemed to have trouble

596
00:45:06,449 --> 00:45:09,316
And it's not my specialty
so I didn't take it out.

597
00:45:09,452 --> 00:45:12,749
But can you leave my name?

598
00:45:12,887 --> 00:45:16,050
It can be great worth before I die.

599
00:45:17,691 --> 00:45:20,751
What are you doing, Jang?
She's asking you.

600
00:45:20,895 --> 00:45:24,763
She's asking you to leave her name.

601
00:45:25,399 --> 00:45:30,666
Yes, I will.
I will leave your name no matter what.

602
00:45:31,605 --> 00:45:35,472
Then I'll believe in you.

603
00:45:50,422 --> 00:45:53,085
Can I believe in you?

604
00:45:53,226 --> 00:45:54,284
Yes?

605
00:45:54,427 --> 00:45:56,486
Leave my name on it?

606
00:45:56,629 --> 00:45:59,096
Yes, I will leave it.

607
00:45:59,231 --> 00:46:03,291
I do what I need to do
and I have Haneuljae people with me.

608
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:08,401
I designed the machine for making papers.

609
00:46:08,539 --> 00:46:09,802
Really?

610
00:46:10,842 --> 00:46:13,536
Then we have a job to do.

611
00:46:21,485 --> 00:46:25,545
When I starched this,
no insect lay their eggs.

612
00:46:27,892 --> 00:46:29,552
Take a look.

613
00:46:30,193 --> 00:46:31,660
Do you press papers with it?

614
00:46:31,795 --> 00:46:35,663
Yes, put moist paper and dried paper,

615
00:46:35,799 --> 00:46:37,857
Before paper get dried, you press it.

616
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,368
Isn't it the same principle as ironing?

617
00:46:41,503 --> 00:46:45,769
Yes, it makes the surface very smooth

618
00:46:45,908 --> 00:46:49,571
And paper gets thin
and ink will spread evenly.

619
00:46:53,815 --> 00:46:55,976
Gather up after work!

620
00:47:22,676 --> 00:47:24,837
So how do you do starch?

621
00:47:24,977 --> 00:47:30,245
If you ripe it, it spreads out well
in water and last long!

622
00:47:30,383 --> 00:47:32,350
What do you do with paper mulberry?
Grind in millstone?

623
00:47:32,485 --> 00:47:35,147
Tap it, grind it, and pound it.

624
00:47:35,287 --> 00:47:36,754
Pound it? How?

625
00:47:36,889 --> 00:47:39,152
Beat it like you wash the clothes.

626
00:47:39,291 --> 00:47:43,351
If we need to make it smooth,
we need many materials.

627
00:47:43,495 --> 00:47:46,863
Dr. Mok is in storage,
I'll find it out.

628
00:47:46,999 --> 00:47:49,865
He'll steal it,
if it's for invention.

629
00:47:50,502 --> 00:47:52,367
So who's making reed screen?

630
00:47:52,504 --> 00:47:55,166
Isn't it tiresome?
Make Jang to do it.

631
00:47:55,306 --> 00:47:55,965
Why me?

632
00:47:56,107 --> 00:47:59,974
Because you're tiresome.
You do it.

633
00:48:00,111 --> 00:48:03,377
Yes, tiresome and longer ones make him do it.

634
00:48:03,515 --> 00:48:07,883
And creepy ones too.
He's so creepy.

635
00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:24,378
Is it that serious?

636
00:50:24,513 --> 00:50:25,980
Yes, lord.

637
00:50:26,115 --> 00:50:29,982
If you listen to their demand,
our damage is severe.

638
00:50:30,119 --> 00:50:33,485
Neverthless, progress has been very slow.

639
00:50:33,621 --> 00:50:35,486
Make a plan!

640
00:50:35,823 --> 00:50:39,588
We need to make it with our method.

641
00:50:39,727 --> 00:50:43,787
Whoever invents it, reward them enough.

642
00:50:43,932 --> 00:50:45,398
Yes, lord.

643
00:50:49,237 --> 00:50:51,101
I told you to make it ages ago.

644
00:50:51,238 --> 00:50:53,205
You still don't have good result?

645
00:50:53,338 --> 00:50:56,002
Did you deliver its urgency?

646
00:50:56,142 --> 00:51:01,604
We don't have skill yet.
Rushing it won't work.

647
00:51:02,248 --> 00:51:04,614
What happened to Taehaksa's technology!

648
00:51:14,894 --> 00:51:18,260
It depends on nation's benefit.
Why is it so slow?

649
00:51:18,396 --> 00:51:20,763
We're doing our best.

650
00:51:29,307 --> 00:51:32,867
Bu Yeosun came last time,
now it's Prince's turn?

651
00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:35,774
Did someone burn something last night?

652
00:51:35,914 --> 00:51:36,880
What is it?

653
00:51:37,015 --> 00:51:38,379
There are a lot of ashes.

654
00:51:38,515 --> 00:51:41,779
Frankly, there is mark of
using paper box.

655
00:51:41,918 --> 00:51:44,080
Have we been robbed?

656
00:51:44,221 --> 00:51:47,189
Nothing's missing but mark's of use.

657
00:51:48,324 --> 00:51:49,792
You're harsh.

658
00:51:50,426 --> 00:51:53,987
If your mean is this,
invent the papers.

659
00:51:54,130 --> 00:51:56,290
Soon, Soo's messenger will be here.

660
00:51:56,431 --> 00:52:00,197
They will ask for unreasonable demand
for their papers.

661
00:52:02,038 --> 00:52:03,402
Yes, sir.

662
00:52:07,843 --> 00:52:10,004
He's in Dr. Mok's room?

663
00:52:10,144 --> 00:52:11,203
Yes.

664
00:52:11,846 --> 00:52:13,438
How is Mok Rasoo?

665
00:52:13,581 --> 00:52:15,641
He's stuck in storage.

666
00:52:15,783 --> 00:52:18,150
How about Jang?

667
00:52:18,286 --> 00:52:21,948
Jang and Haneuljae people are very quiet.

668
00:52:23,090 --> 00:52:25,957
Please go in.
It looks like it'll rain.

669
00:52:28,795 --> 00:52:30,558
- I'm sorry.
- You fool!

670
00:52:31,899 --> 00:52:33,764
- Damn.
- We've a problem.

671
00:52:37,303 --> 00:52:39,168
I'm inqurying my greet.

672
00:52:41,508 --> 00:52:42,668
Who are they?

673
00:52:42,809 --> 00:52:44,673
They're engineers of Haneuljae.

674
00:52:45,411 --> 00:52:46,776
Isn't he Jang?

675
00:52:46,912 --> 00:52:49,473
What are they doing.
Follow me!

676
00:52:49,616 --> 00:52:50,775
Yes.

677
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:56,283
Hurry, hurry.

678
00:53:06,832 --> 00:53:09,095
What the hell are you doing here!

679
00:53:11,235 --> 00:53:14,226
Why are you gathered here and doing what!
