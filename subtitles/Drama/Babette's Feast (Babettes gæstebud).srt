1
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:08,119
The competition for Arirang's 5th Master

2
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,095
will now begin.

3
00:00:14,146 --> 00:00:17,360
<i>Final Episode</i>

4
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:34,696
Go Joon Young and

5
00:00:34,697 --> 00:00:35,952
Song Yeon Woo,

6
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:38,607
Arirang's 5th Master contenders,

7
00:00:38,608 --> 00:00:43,288
you may now start the competition.

8
00:01:36,587 --> 00:01:39,533
<i>The mullet will now be prepared.</i>

9
00:03:56,954 --> 00:03:58,852
Where are you running away to?

10
00:03:58,853 --> 00:04:00,091
Go back.

11
00:04:00,092 --> 00:04:01,702
Go and protect your disciple

12
00:04:01,703 --> 00:04:02,934
and your position.

13
00:04:02,935 --> 00:04:05,084
I'll take care of it.

14
00:04:09,657 --> 00:04:11,491
Aren't you curious?

15
00:04:11,492 --> 00:04:13,556
About who'll win?

16
00:04:17,045 --> 00:04:19,840
Sometimes I wondered.

17
00:04:19,841 --> 00:04:23,063
Twenty two years ago,
if you hadn't done that

18
00:04:23,064 --> 00:04:26,502
and competed fairly, who would've won?

19
00:04:26,503 --> 00:04:28,623
You're lying.

20
00:04:28,624 --> 00:04:30,668
Naturally, you think you would have.

21
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:33,360
The only person who thinks that is you.

22
00:04:33,361 --> 00:04:38,058
You've never considered me your rival.

23
00:04:38,059 --> 00:04:39,814
You've always

24
00:04:39,815 --> 00:04:41,374
looked down on me.

25
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:44,015
I didn't want to be caught,

26
00:04:44,016 --> 00:04:46,506
that I want to beat Seol Hee.

27
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:51,356
I want to be Master.

28
00:07:29,948 --> 00:07:30,750
Then

29
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:32,601
starting now, the judges

30
00:07:32,602 --> 00:07:35,156
will taste the food.

31
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:19,511
Both of you worked hard.

32
00:08:19,512 --> 00:08:23,028
Explain your dish.

33
00:08:29,623 --> 00:08:31,414
Though it was only for a short time,

34
00:08:31,415 --> 00:08:33,279
the Arirang that I've seen

35
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,184
has many different expressions.

36
00:08:36,185 --> 00:08:38,742
The kitchen staff's expressions,

37
00:08:38,743 --> 00:08:41,471
the seasonal changes of the menu,

38
00:08:41,472 --> 00:08:44,214
and even the customers who come here

39
00:08:44,215 --> 00:08:47,094
every day was different.

40
00:08:47,095 --> 00:08:49,521
During a few months it's like that

41
00:08:49,522 --> 00:08:51,864
so the 100 years of its existence,

42
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:54,723
it's hard to express it all in one dish.

43
00:08:54,724 --> 00:08:57,216
So if you can't express it all in one dish?

44
00:08:57,217 --> 00:08:59,626
That's why the dish I chose is

45
00:08:59,627 --> 00:09:02,393
carp with jeolpyeon stew.

46
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:06,351
In this one bowl,

47
00:09:06,352 --> 00:09:09,984
including beef, fish, various vegetables,

48
00:09:09,985 --> 00:09:11,582
and the jeolpyeon instead of rice

49
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,181
were all arranged harmoniously

50
00:09:13,182 --> 00:09:14,500
then with a broth seasoned

51
00:09:14,501 --> 00:09:15,820
with traditional soy sauce

52
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:18,013
I made a stew.

53
00:09:19,341 --> 00:09:21,340
I wanted to express the integrity

54
00:09:21,341 --> 00:09:22,508
that has protected Arirang

55
00:09:22,509 --> 00:09:23,677
for more than 100 years

56
00:09:23,678 --> 00:09:25,469
amidst fierce strife

57
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:29,136
in this one bowl.

58
00:09:29,137 --> 00:09:30,707
So

59
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:33,415
Arirang's long tradition,

60
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:36,097
fragrance, and sentiment...

61
00:09:36,098 --> 00:09:37,957
All of those things

62
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:41,356
are contained in this one dish?

63
00:09:45,074 --> 00:09:47,016
My dish is

64
00:09:47,017 --> 00:09:50,552
five colored steamed carp
made with 8 ingredients.

65
00:09:50,553 --> 00:09:53,510
Beef, ginseng, sea cucumber, abalone,

66
00:09:53,511 --> 00:09:55,304
shitake mushroom, bamboo shoot...

67
00:09:55,305 --> 00:09:57,099
With such valuable ingredients

68
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,879
I stuffed the carp's stomach.

69
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,183
Color,

70
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:02,227
texture,

71
00:10:02,228 --> 00:10:03,663
and taste

72
00:10:03,664 --> 00:10:06,450
all are magnificent.

73
00:10:06,451 --> 00:10:11,219
But if you use such expensive ingredients,

74
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:11,600
will anyone order it?

75
00:10:11,601 --> 00:10:13,075
Will anyone order it?

76
00:10:13,076 --> 00:10:15,328
There probably won't be.

77
00:10:16,528 --> 00:10:19,068
The expensive price is a problem but

78
00:10:19,069 --> 00:10:22,149
it is also hard to find such
high quality ingredients.

79
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:26,553
Eight jewels,

80
00:10:26,554 --> 00:10:31,486
like the 5 colored steamed carp made with
8 ingredients is too precious to eat.

81
00:10:31,928 --> 00:10:35,103
Something that has been
prepared with the utmost care.

82
00:10:35,104 --> 00:10:37,178
That

83
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:39,798
to me, is Korean Cuisine's image.

84
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,101
Yes.

85
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:45,628
That's so.

86
00:10:48,668 --> 00:10:50,614
In this dish, I wanted to

87
00:10:50,615 --> 00:10:53,137
express the preciousness of Korean Cuisine

88
00:10:53,138 --> 00:10:55,720
that Arirang will protect
for another 100 years

89
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:57,885
to everyone.

90
00:11:05,667 --> 00:11:07,515
And that is what I,

91
00:11:08,929 --> 00:11:11,778
for 10 years at Arirang,

92
00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:14,189
have seen

93
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:15,869
felt,

94
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,351
and learned.

95
00:11:34,878 --> 00:11:36,208
Then

96
00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:39,544
while the judges are
discussing their opinions

97
00:11:39,545 --> 00:11:43,616
we ask the two contenders
to wait off the stage.

98
00:11:55,888 --> 00:11:57,539
Seriously..

99
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:00,783
Stop looking so upset.

100
00:12:00,784 --> 00:12:05,887
Excuse me, but I am only driving because you
complained so much about your heavy bags.

101
00:12:05,888 --> 00:12:08,271
So why don't you just close that mouth.

102
00:12:08,272 --> 00:12:10,283
This transfer was decided suddenly!

103
00:12:10,284 --> 00:12:13,673
Still, it probably wasn't
decided this morning!

104
00:12:20,992 --> 00:12:23,141
Are you not going

105
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:25,100
to call Joon Young?

106
00:12:27,682 --> 00:12:30,267
If you really love someone

107
00:12:30,268 --> 00:12:32,985
you sometimes have to erase
everything from your head

108
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,330
Where I need to be standing right now.

109
00:12:36,331 --> 00:12:39,523
So you're just going to disapear?

110
00:12:39,524 --> 00:12:41,048
That's what's wrong with you

111
00:12:41,049 --> 00:12:43,797
If you like someone you
should stay by her side.

112
00:12:44,493 --> 00:12:46,433
I also want to live

113
00:12:46,434 --> 00:12:49,316
carefreely and freely just like you

114
00:12:49,317 --> 00:12:50,730
You can't.

115
00:12:50,731 --> 00:12:53,761
You start living like me, I'm
just going to get rid of you

116
00:13:20,204 --> 00:13:22,802
No matter what name you choose to go by

117
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:25,010
I'm going to keep on
living as Go Joon Young.

118
00:13:26,692 --> 00:13:29,882
The Joon Young who lived
wholeheartly and well

119
00:13:29,883 --> 00:13:31,725
I sincerely love her

120
00:13:31,726 --> 00:13:33,590
No matter what my name is

121
00:13:33,591 --> 00:13:37,749
the fact that she's Dad and
Mom's daughter won't change.

122
00:13:40,781 --> 00:13:43,397
You don't know, do you?

123
00:13:43,398 --> 00:13:46,954
If someone who has
everything is too dignified,

124
00:13:46,955 --> 00:13:49,337
how uncomfortable it makes people feel.

125
00:14:02,547 --> 00:14:04,620
The decision has been made.

126
00:14:06,418 --> 00:14:08,529
Regardless of who won, you can

127
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:10,642
acknowledge the winner, right?

128
00:14:13,883 --> 00:14:16,254
You expressed the present image of Arirang

129
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:18,711
so well.

130
00:14:20,562 --> 00:14:22,323
Thank you.

131
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:25,086
But

132
00:14:25,087 --> 00:14:28,301
the Master that Arirang now needs is

133
00:14:28,302 --> 00:14:30,142
someone who can lead Arirang
into the next 100 years

134
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:33,708
more than someone who can protect its past.

135
00:14:41,069 --> 00:14:42,521
In Joo,

136
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:47,584
you are Arirang's 5th Master.

137
00:14:48,667 --> 00:14:50,627
You did well.

138
00:15:02,162 --> 00:15:05,033
Why are you crying?

139
00:15:05,034 --> 00:15:07,919
There'll be so much more to cry about.

140
00:15:14,184 --> 00:15:16,870
It's because she's so happy.

141
00:15:16,871 --> 00:15:19,004
Aren't you being too greedy?

142
00:15:19,005 --> 00:15:22,450
Tears should be conceded to the loser.

143
00:15:27,411 --> 00:15:29,442
Congratulations.

144
00:16:04,844 --> 00:16:06,919
Alright.

145
00:16:08,205 --> 00:16:10,748
Let go of it all.

146
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:13,539
The venom in your heart and

147
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:16,865
hatred and greed.

148
00:16:16,866 --> 00:16:19,298
Cry it all away.

149
00:16:20,619 --> 00:16:22,651
You did well, my daughter.

150
00:16:23,726 --> 00:16:26,909
Thank you for doing well, my daughter.

151
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,195
Why are you hiding here?

152
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:53,919
If I'm near

153
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,974
Mom won't be able to
congratulate her fully.

154
00:16:56,975 --> 00:16:58,413
You're taking this better than I thought.

155
00:16:58,414 --> 00:17:02,717
Truthfully, I already knew the results.

156
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:07,295
No matter how much I try,

157
00:17:07,296 --> 00:17:11,281
her 22 years of experience

158
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:15,377
and passion for Arirang

159
00:17:15,378 --> 00:17:17,010
can't be beaten.

160
00:17:17,011 --> 00:17:18,998
Are you jealous?

161
00:17:19,632 --> 00:17:22,596
I'm envious.

162
00:17:22,597 --> 00:17:25,311
But, I like it now.

163
00:17:25,312 --> 00:17:27,195
Being able to cook as much as I want

164
00:17:27,196 --> 00:17:29,555
and live freely.

165
00:17:30,678 --> 00:17:32,656
The title "Master"

166
00:17:33,681 --> 00:17:35,998
does not fit me well.

167
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:39,608
Truthfully, I knew your skill level

168
00:17:39,609 --> 00:17:41,411
when I ate that lunch you packed for me.

169
00:17:41,412 --> 00:17:43,741
You need to improve a lot more.

170
00:17:43,742 --> 00:17:46,955
You're so great at comforting.

171
00:17:46,956 --> 00:17:49,465
You'd improve if you went abroad

172
00:17:49,466 --> 00:17:51,976
and learned from a great teacher.

173
00:17:51,977 --> 00:17:54,429
A great teacher?

174
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,595
I'm not joking.

175
00:18:01,596 --> 00:18:03,192
"The potatoes are overcooked.

176
00:18:03,193 --> 00:18:04,790
The carrots are soggy."

177
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:07,148
You'd scold me every day!

178
00:18:07,946 --> 00:18:10,787
I don't want a teacher like that.

179
00:18:42,104 --> 00:18:43,413
Hey, hey!

180
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:45,712
I'll go in by myself.

181
00:18:45,713 --> 00:18:47,293
True, it's not like we're never

182
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:48,875
going to see each other again.

183
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:51,725
Get inside.

184
00:18:51,726 --> 00:18:52,685
In Woo.

185
00:18:52,685 --> 00:18:53,684
Alright, I know.

186
00:18:53,685 --> 00:18:55,172
I'll go check on your grandmother

187
00:18:55,173 --> 00:18:56,661
while wishing her good morning!

188
00:18:56,662 --> 00:18:58,006
If she doesn't look well I'll

189
00:18:58,007 --> 00:18:59,351
immediately take her to a hospital.

190
00:18:59,352 --> 00:19:01,224
And twice a keep go and keep her company.

191
00:19:01,225 --> 00:19:02,229
That's it, right?

192
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:03,234
I didn't get anything wrong?

193
00:19:03,235 --> 00:19:05,635
There's a person who lost
her life 22 year ago

194
00:19:05,636 --> 00:19:08,516
while protecting Joon Young in the ocean.

195
00:19:08,977 --> 00:19:10,378
Not her foster father?

196
00:19:10,379 --> 00:19:12,134
She's related to us, too.

197
00:19:12,135 --> 00:19:13,370
Who?

198
00:19:13,371 --> 00:19:15,547
In Joo's mother.

199
00:19:18,509 --> 00:19:21,058
Yes, Mom.

200
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:23,440
Because I was nervous all morning,

201
00:19:23,441 --> 00:19:25,552
I'm a bit tired.

202
00:19:27,144 --> 00:19:30,152
Today, congratulate In Joo a lot.

203
00:19:30,153 --> 00:19:32,866
Alright. Thank you.

204
00:19:33,841 --> 00:19:36,636
Joon Young,

205
00:19:36,637 --> 00:19:39,148
you did really well today.

206
00:19:39,881 --> 00:19:42,594
Even if you're not the Master, to me

207
00:19:42,595 --> 00:19:45,945
you are a disciple I'm proud of.

208
00:19:45,946 --> 00:19:48,313
Yes.

209
00:19:48,314 --> 00:19:50,303
Take care.

210
00:19:59,152 --> 00:20:00,375
<i>1 new message.</i>

211
00:20:00,376 --> 00:20:01,600
<i>Jae Ha</i>

212
00:20:11,223 --> 00:20:13,443
<i>I'm leaving now.</i>

213
00:20:13,444 --> 00:20:16,373
<i>Maybe I'll return after 2 or 3 years.</i>

214
00:20:16,653 --> 00:20:19,886
<i>Ha In Joo, our little...</i>

215
00:20:19,887 --> 00:20:21,626
<i>If you are crying when I return,</i>

216
00:20:21,627 --> 00:20:23,366
you are going to get in big trouble.

217
00:20:23,367 --> 00:20:25,205
<i>Live courageously.</i>

218
00:20:25,206 --> 00:20:29,691
<i>My idol, Go Joon Young, fighting!</i>

219
00:20:34,075 --> 00:20:40,358
<i>Thank you, and</i>

220
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:44,577
<i>I'm very sorry.</i>

221
00:21:25,422 --> 00:21:27,450
<i>Hyung</i>

222
00:21:27,451 --> 00:21:30,769
<i>loved you a lot.</i>

223

<i>Hyung is in a lot of pain</i>

224
00:22:21,536 --> 00:22:23,860
<i>because of you.</i>

225
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:27,585
<i>And I</i>

226
00:22:33,403 --> 00:22:36,408
<i>can't forgive you.</i>

227
00:22:38,645 --> 00:22:41,435
<i>I'm sorry, my child.</i>

228
00:22:44,195 --> 00:22:46,835
<i>I'm sorry Ji Yoon.</i>

229
00:22:48,362 --> 00:22:52,028
My child..I'm so sorry

230
00:23:33,124 --> 00:23:36,853
The person who saved our
Joon Young is In Joo's Mom?

231
00:23:36,854 --> 00:23:38,740
I'm don't know for certain, but

232
00:23:38,741 --> 00:23:40,476
that day In Joo's Mom

233
00:23:40,477 --> 00:23:42,673
fell of the cruise ship that we were on.

234
00:23:42,674 --> 00:23:48,184
Then, while trying to rescue
Joon Young, In Joo's Mom...

235
00:23:48,185 --> 00:23:50,602
Even if it wasn't for Joon Young,

236
00:23:52,805 --> 00:23:56,600
she would have left this world anyway.

237
00:24:12,967 --> 00:24:15,392
Until now,

238
00:24:15,393 --> 00:24:18,939
have you taken care of it all by yourself?

239
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:26,940
At that time, I promised her
that I'd take good care of her.

240
00:24:43,053 --> 00:24:46,942
Nice and pretty In Joo

241
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:50,089
is dong well.

242
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:56,565
Next time, we'll all come together.

243
00:24:57,259 --> 00:25:00,962
All this time,

244
00:25:00,963 --> 00:25:08,823
our In Joo suffered all alone

245
00:25:08,824 --> 00:25:13,037
because of me.

246
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:15,863
I'm sorry.

247
00:25:29,434 --> 00:25:32,406
And

248
00:25:32,407 --> 00:25:40,315
thank you for saving our Joon Young,

249
00:25:42,468 --> 00:25:45,194
really

250
00:25:46,136 --> 00:25:50,098
I'm so thankful.

251
00:25:56,775 --> 00:25:58,674
Why are you smiling?

252
00:25:58,675 --> 00:26:00,575
What are you so happy about?

253
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:02,972
You intended to lose from the beginning?

254
00:26:02,973 --> 00:26:06,711
No. I really wanted to win.

255
00:26:06,712 --> 00:26:09,142
I wanted to win by cooking

256
00:26:09,143 --> 00:26:11,573
for the first time since I was born.

257
00:26:11,574 --> 00:26:14,625
Honestly, it was a little difficult.

258
00:26:15,542 --> 00:26:20,288
In Joo had spent time at Arirang,

259
00:26:20,289 --> 00:26:22,887
and she has special love
for it unlike myself.

260
00:26:22,888 --> 00:26:26,030
Please acknowledge her, Grandma.

261
00:26:26,031 --> 00:26:31,654
She only thought about
Arirang all this time.

262
00:26:31,655 --> 00:26:34,236
She probably saw the world differently

263
00:26:34,237 --> 00:26:36,819
than you from the beginning.

264
00:26:37,732 --> 00:26:39,656
What are you going to do now?

265
00:26:39,657 --> 00:26:40,953
Are you just...

266
00:26:40,954 --> 00:26:47,556
I could learn more about Korean cusine and
traditions from people at Arirang. But,

267
00:26:48,528 --> 00:26:52,824
I was happier cooking in Udo.

268
00:26:55,764 --> 00:26:58,008
You were using natural ingredients

269
00:26:58,009 --> 00:27:02,570
from the vast sea to
cook however you wanted.

270
00:27:02,571 --> 00:27:07,822
It was greedy of me to hold you here.

271
00:27:07,823 --> 00:27:09,595
I understand.

272
00:27:13,453 --> 00:27:15,495
No. I'm coming for sure this month.

273
00:27:15,496 --> 00:27:17,538
I never forget.

274
00:27:17,539 --> 00:27:20,445
There are still things to be done in Korea.

275
00:27:20,446 --> 00:27:23,903
Sure, don't worry. You can count on me.

276
00:27:28,193 --> 00:27:29,996
Are you committing fraud?

277
00:27:29,997 --> 00:27:36,231
No. It's not a fraud. We'll definitely go,
and show the best cooking within this month.

278
00:27:36,232 --> 00:27:37,536
Not yet, I told you that.

279
00:27:37,537 --> 00:27:40,655
Then, when? After you lose all your fans?

280
00:27:40,656 --> 00:27:42,276
You're scary.

281
00:27:43,271 --> 00:27:46,176
I surrender unconditionally today.

282
00:27:46,177 --> 00:27:49,006
Where are you running away to again?

283
00:27:49,007 --> 00:27:52,385
Look carefully, Haemil's fan site...

284
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:58,662
stopped.

285
00:28:01,727 --> 00:28:04,705
President Baek...

286
00:28:07,705 --> 00:28:09,223
<i>Breaking news. Sanarae President acknowledged in the
Haemil incident that the fault was entirely hers.</i>

287
00:28:09,224 --> 00:28:14,424
<i>President Baek Seol Hee announced she apologizes to her ideal son
Kim Do Young and will seek forgiveness to conclude the incident.</i>

288
00:28:29,182 --> 00:28:30,692
Jane.

289
00:28:30,693 --> 00:28:32,558
Is something wrong?

290
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,620
You don't look good.

291
00:28:34,621 --> 00:28:37,061
I...have something to ask you.

292
00:28:37,062 --> 00:28:39,503
That's why I asked you to meet me.

293
00:28:40,585 --> 00:28:43,102
Haemil, I mean

294
00:28:43,103 --> 00:28:48,293
Kim Do Yoon - do you love him?

295
00:28:49,114 --> 00:28:51,888
If you can't answer me decisively,

296
00:28:51,889 --> 00:28:54,664
please let go of Do Yoon.

297
00:28:54,665 --> 00:28:58,769
Am I interfering with his life?

298
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:04,735
No. You saved his life.

299
00:29:04,958 --> 00:29:08,085
While he was loving you,

300
00:29:08,086 --> 00:29:10,063
he was able to smile genuinely,

301
00:29:10,064 --> 00:29:12,438
cry.

302
00:29:12,439 --> 00:29:15,940
He became human.

303
00:29:15,941 --> 00:29:21,157
But Chef Kim Do Yoon
doesn't have time to wait.

304
00:29:21,158 --> 00:29:28,254
He made public his dishonourable family history and if
people know about a breach of contract because of a woman,

305
00:29:28,255 --> 00:29:33,040
It willl be difficult to recover.

306
00:29:39,697 --> 00:29:41,535
Say that again.

307
00:29:41,536 --> 00:29:43,375
Who is coming?

308
00:29:43,376 --> 00:29:45,881
Kim Do Yoon?

309
00:29:45,882 --> 00:29:48,785
Yes.

310
00:29:57,887 --> 00:30:01,598
Tell him I have an urgent
phone call, have him wait.

311
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:03,245
Yes.

312
00:30:17,819 --> 00:30:20,484
Haemil's come to my home.

313
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:23,767
Should I be crying because I'm so honored?

314
00:30:24,491 --> 00:30:26,389
Are you going out?

315
00:30:28,588 --> 00:30:33,168
There's a Female CEO dinner meeting today.

316
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:38,157
If you have something to
say, say it quickly and go.

317
00:30:43,016 --> 00:30:43,812
What?

318
00:30:43,813 --> 00:30:47,614
Since I confirmed you're
alive, I'm going to go.

319
00:30:49,956 --> 00:30:51,623
You thought that this Baek Seol Hee

320
00:30:51,624 --> 00:30:53,291
would be lying in bed?

321
00:30:53,292 --> 00:30:56,129
You haven't heard yet?

322
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:58,968
For the first time in 22
years, I beat Sung Do Hee.

323
00:30:58,969 --> 00:31:00,774
I heard.

324
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:02,581
Congratulations.

325
00:31:03,616 --> 00:31:05,856
You need to go out, right?

326
00:31:05,857 --> 00:31:08,098
I'll leave.

327
00:31:09,102 --> 00:31:11,387
Ji Yoon,

328
00:31:12,698 --> 00:31:17,406
is my son. Not just your brother.

329
00:31:17,407 --> 00:31:21,086
Stop being arrogant and
let him rest in peace.

330
00:31:44,346 --> 00:31:46,785
I told you I don't want anything.

331
00:31:46,786 --> 00:31:50,980
Your son told me I must.

332
00:32:21,252 --> 00:32:24,658
It..tastes good.

333
00:33:12,595 --> 00:33:14,589
Are you mad?

334
00:33:15,999 --> 00:33:19,201
I won't hate Mom anymore,

335
00:33:19,202 --> 00:33:21,565
so don't scold me so much.

336
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:27,567
<i>Ji Yoon ssi.</i>

337
00:33:27,568 --> 00:33:30,648
<i>Kim Ji Yoon ssi.</i>

338
00:33:32,248 --> 00:33:35,535
<i>Kim Ji Yoon.</i>

339
00:33:56,299 --> 00:33:59,440
I'm going to go to that girl now.

340
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:02,476
Since you two are close, speak well of me.

341
00:34:13,463 --> 00:34:15,562
I told you I was busy.

342
00:34:15,563 --> 00:34:17,331
I'm hungry.

343
00:34:18,426 --> 00:34:21,179
What kind of chef is always hungry?

344
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:23,497
Go cook.

345
00:34:23,498 --> 00:34:27,532
Right, you have a lot of money. Go buy it.

346
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:31,007
I don't want to.

347
00:34:31,008 --> 00:34:33,196
Let's eat together.

348
00:34:47,553 --> 00:34:48,486
Aren't you hot?

349
00:34:48,487 --> 00:34:50,072
Are you kidding?

350
00:34:50,073 --> 00:34:51,660
I'm so hot I could die.

351
00:34:51,661 --> 00:34:52,974
Then take it off.

352
00:34:52,975 --> 00:34:55,449
What if there are reporters?

353
00:34:57,502 --> 00:35:00,183
You think the reporters will recognize you?

354
00:35:02,054 --> 00:35:03,515
Things have finally calmed down

355
00:35:03,516 --> 00:35:04,977
between you and President Baek.

356
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:09,069
You'll be in a difficult
situation if there's a scandal.

357
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:11,987
You stand out more like that.

358
00:35:11,988 --> 00:35:15,003
You'll probably cause the scandal.

359
00:35:26,265 --> 00:35:27,489
Get out.

360
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,445
That person?

361
00:35:39,446 --> 00:35:41,291
No way..

362
00:35:41,292 --> 00:35:43,782
I think that's him.

363
00:35:43,783 --> 00:35:46,274
I really think that's him.

364
00:35:48,538 --> 00:35:51,312
Who's the woman he's with?

365
00:35:51,313 --> 00:35:53,945
Is that his girlfriend?

366
00:35:53,946 --> 00:35:56,578
I'm so jealous.

367
00:35:56,579 --> 00:35:58,913
I have a picture, I think it's him.

368
00:35:58,914 --> 00:36:01,016
Go and ask.

369
00:36:01,017 --> 00:36:03,120
I'm right, right?

370
00:36:05,404 --> 00:36:10,413
Excuse me. You're Haemil,
the star chef, right?

371
00:36:14,696 --> 00:36:16,572
No, I'm not.

372
00:36:16,573 --> 00:36:19,092
This is you.

373
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:32,162
You said you were hungry.

374
00:36:32,163 --> 00:36:34,055
Choose.

375
00:36:35,801 --> 00:36:38,002
I'm not hungry.

376
00:36:38,003 --> 00:36:40,346
There's nothing I want to eat on the menu.

377
00:36:40,347 --> 00:36:42,691
Eat alone.

378
00:36:47,964 --> 00:36:48,458
Let go.

379
00:36:48,459 --> 00:36:51,395
You said there's nothing you want to eat.

380
00:36:51,396 --> 00:36:54,526
I'll cook for you.

381
00:36:58,258 --> 00:37:01,038
What do you think you're doing?

382
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:04,859
If you don't want to get
more attention, sit still.

383
00:38:48,557 --> 00:38:53,207
<i>If he continues to delay it
might be the end for Do Yoon.</i>

384
00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:56,040
Go Joon Young-

385
00:38:56,041 --> 00:38:58,712
Wow, it's amazing that I can
see Haemil cooking here!

386
00:38:58,713 --> 00:39:01,384
It looks delicious. Can
you make one for me?

387
00:39:01,385 --> 00:39:04,816
No, I can't make anymore.

388
00:39:08,128 --> 00:39:11,947
This dish is one of a kind.

389
00:39:13,255 --> 00:39:15,895
One of a kind?

390
00:39:15,896 --> 00:39:18,537
Are you proposing?

391
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,225
Proposing by cooking.

392
00:39:23,226 --> 00:39:25,731
So cool!

393
00:39:25,732 --> 00:39:27,315
Who is she?

394
00:39:27,316 --> 00:39:28,900
Incredible!

395
00:39:38,923 --> 00:39:42,697
I'm going to go first.

396
00:40:12,181 --> 00:40:15,674
<i>Just grant me one wish.</i>

397
00:40:16,418 --> 00:40:18,748
<i>Now, I-</i>

398
00:40:19,928 --> 00:40:21,905
<i>I'm going to go to you.</i>

399
00:40:21,906 --> 00:40:24,247
<i>You... just don't run away too much.</i>

400
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,081
<i>That's the first time
anyone's said that to me.</i>

401
00:40:27,082 --> 00:40:30,122
<i>"I know you well. I'm
comfortable around you."</i>

402
00:40:30,123 --> 00:40:31,622
<i>"Thank you."</i>

403
00:40:34,903 --> 00:40:36,621
<i>This bastard!</i>

404
00:40:41,792 --> 00:40:44,798
<i>I take back what I said about running away.</i>

405
00:40:44,799 --> 00:40:46,685
<i>You, you come to me too.</i>

406
00:40:47,984 --> 00:40:50,173
<i>I'm having a hard time.</i>

407
00:40:51,189 --> 00:40:52,189
<i>Go Joon Young,</i>

408
00:40:52,962 --> 00:40:54,971
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

409
00:41:31,106 --> 00:41:33,042
We need to talk.

410
00:41:33,418 --> 00:41:34,417
I'm tired.

411
00:41:34,418 --> 00:41:35,834
Why?

412
00:41:35,835 --> 00:41:40,446
Because the great Haemil
proposed by cooking,

413
00:41:40,447 --> 00:41:42,030
but was rejected?

414
00:41:43,129 --> 00:41:45,035
"Star Chef Haemil's ordeal"

415
00:41:45,036 --> 00:41:46,943
It's ranked first on the search engines.

416
00:41:49,796 --> 00:41:51,616
This is Kim Do Yoon's schedule.

417
00:41:51,617 --> 00:41:53,570
Starts next week.

418
00:41:53,571 --> 00:41:54,987
BBC's cooking program,

419
00:41:54,988 --> 00:41:56,405
Haemil's Cooking School,

420
00:41:56,406 --> 00:41:58,549
community service projects.

421
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:01,479
And a World Tour starting year-end.

422
00:42:01,829 --> 00:42:03,003
Let's talk later.

423
00:42:03,004 --> 00:42:04,204
There's nothing to discuss,

424
00:42:04,205 --> 00:42:05,405
the contracts have been signed.

425
00:42:05,406 --> 00:42:06,114
Jane!

426
00:42:06,115 --> 00:42:08,552
It's your decision of course.

427
00:42:08,553 --> 00:42:09,933
But before you refuse,

428
00:42:09,934 --> 00:42:12,344
you'll need to declare bankruptcy.

429
00:42:15,226 --> 00:42:17,546
I met Joon Young

430
00:42:17,547 --> 00:42:19,298
and asked her to let you go.

431
00:42:21,543 --> 00:42:22,797
You,

432
00:42:22,798 --> 00:42:25,992
Do you know how selfish
your love is right now?

433
00:42:25,993 --> 00:42:27,898
You have to go anyway.

434
00:42:27,899 --> 00:42:30,198
Then what about Joon Young?

435
00:42:30,199 --> 00:42:33,291
She finally met her family.

436
00:42:33,292 --> 00:42:36,090
And what about her dreams?

437
00:42:36,676 --> 00:42:38,371
Don't delude yourself.

438
00:42:38,372 --> 00:42:40,785
Chasing and pushing ahead is not love.

439
00:42:40,786 --> 00:42:42,145
A worthless man who can't

440
00:42:42,146 --> 00:42:43,505
even take care of his own work

441
00:42:43,506 --> 00:42:46,184
definitely has no right.

442
00:43:02,688 --> 00:43:04,800
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

443
00:43:04,801 --> 00:43:06,367
<i>I would like Haemil</i>

444
00:43:06,368 --> 00:43:09,812
<i>to cook foods which can be enjoyed</i>

445
00:43:09,813 --> 00:43:11,450
<i>by all the people in the world</i>

446
00:43:11,451 --> 00:43:15,162
<i>instead of cooking food
for just one person.</i>

447
00:43:39,151 --> 00:43:41,354
<i>I will..</i>

448
00:44:01,137 --> 00:44:03,771
You really struggled.

449
00:44:17,728 --> 00:44:19,378
Master Sun, please come up to the stage.

450
00:44:19,379 --> 00:44:21,996
Please applaud her.

451
00:44:53,702 --> 00:44:55,779
Sung Do Hee, the 4th Master,

452
00:44:55,780 --> 00:45:00,217
will present Arirang's lotus medal herself.

453
00:45:41,273 --> 00:45:44,429
All the time I spent at Arirang,

454
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:46,785
my dream

455
00:45:46,786 --> 00:45:49,889
has been Sung Do Hee, the 4th Master.

456
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:52,553
I will now continue her goal and

457
00:45:52,554 --> 00:45:54,669
dream of a precious and priceless

458
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:56,499
Arirang.

459
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:59,900
To all those who have stayed by my side:

460
00:45:59,901 --> 00:46:01,229
Master Sun,

461
00:46:02,618 --> 00:46:04,748
our kitchen staff,

462
00:46:06,565 --> 00:46:08,518
the smell of the fermenting sauces,

463
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:10,473
the fragrance of the herbs in the garden,

464
00:46:11,062 --> 00:46:13,368
and everything of Arirang.

465
00:46:13,369 --> 00:46:15,675
I will keep in my heart

466
00:46:15,676 --> 00:46:19,209
and make an Arirang which
will last another 100 years.

467
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:20,827
Thank you.

468
00:46:52,450 --> 00:46:53,916
It's already started.

469
00:46:53,917 --> 00:46:55,071
You should hurry inside.

470
00:46:55,072 --> 00:46:56,788
You acted so high and mighty.

471
00:46:56,789 --> 00:46:58,301
How does it feel to lose?

472
00:46:58,302 --> 00:47:00,155
Because you haven't changed much,

473
00:47:00,156 --> 00:47:01,856
I like that a lot.

474
00:47:01,857 --> 00:47:03,454
You never miss

475
00:47:03,455 --> 00:47:05,924
someone's pain.

476
00:47:06,075 --> 00:47:08,343
I'll take that as a compliment.

477
00:47:08,974 --> 00:47:10,439
Right.

478
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:13,289
Kim Do Yoon, or Haemil, that rot-

479
00:47:14,064 --> 00:47:16,000
that prosperous child

480
00:47:16,001 --> 00:47:17,979
has left.

481
00:47:18,675 --> 00:47:20,130
Thank you!

482
00:47:20,131 --> 00:47:24,537
How worried I was that you
two might get married..

483
00:47:27,417 --> 00:47:29,389
That's great

484
00:47:29,390 --> 00:47:31,091
You threw away your own good fortune.

485
00:47:31,346 --> 00:47:35,205
To him, besides his own brother,

486
00:47:35,541 --> 00:47:37,643
you were first!

487
00:47:37,981 --> 00:47:39,672
Since he's lived his whole life
keeping himself locked up.

488
00:47:39,673 --> 00:47:41,364
If he gets hurt again,

489
00:47:41,365 --> 00:47:43,695
it'll be the end forever.

490
00:47:43,696 --> 00:47:46,740
Well, for me it's fine.

491
00:47:46,741 --> 00:47:48,588
I'm going

492

<i>Star Chef Haemil, returning

493
00:48:56,569 --> 00:48:59,046
Customer, do you want a ride?

494
00:49:01,713 --> 00:49:03,572

Mom! Today's the day you're
opening the GeumChungJang, right?

497
00:50:08,193 --> 00:50:10,049
I'm out of red pepper
paste and soybean paste.

498
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:11,907
Can I drop by to get some?

499
00:50:11,908 --> 00:50:14,472
You only want me when you need something?

500
00:50:14,473 --> 00:50:18,513
Am I like that? You know
I'm very busy, Mom.

504
00:51:09,389 --> 00:51:10,948
Did you call Joon Young?

505
00:51:10,949 --> 00:51:12,063
No.

506
00:51:12,064 --> 00:51:18,440
Well, maybe it's over if you haven't
been in touch over the whole year.

507
00:51:21,337 --> 00:51:24,993
How about me?

508
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,894
Just organize Saturday's Hong Kong

509
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:30,789
Food Fair Schedule and bring it to me.

510
00:51:30,790 --> 00:51:32,344
Here...

511
00:51:32,345 --> 00:51:35,892
"Ha Joon Young's Basic
Korean Cuisine Recipes."

512
00:51:35,893 --> 00:51:38,242
She published this with the International

513
00:51:38,243 --> 00:51:40,593
Korean Cuisine Foundation.
Isnt it incredible?

514
00:51:42,126 --> 00:51:47,261
There's more. Apparently there was news that
fake Korean food was prevailing in China.

515
00:51:47,262 --> 00:51:49,176
Joon Young flew over right away

516
00:51:49,177 --> 00:51:51,092
and picketed alone saying,

517
00:51:51,093 --> 00:51:56,347
"Correct the fake name,
cook with Korean recipes!"

518
00:51:56,348 --> 00:51:59,287
She created such a fuss.

519
00:51:59,288 --> 00:52:02,228
Isn't that so like Joon Young?

520
00:52:03,053 --> 00:52:05,186
A demonstration for
overseas chefs every week

521
00:52:05,187 --> 00:52:07,321
and she even published a book.

522
00:52:07,322 --> 00:52:11,763
She does more than that.
She is busier than me.

523
00:52:12,357 --> 00:52:15,954
You knew eveything already?

524
00:52:28,516 --> 00:52:30,621
Enjoy!

525
00:52:30,622 --> 00:52:32,822
Yes.

526
00:52:32,823 --> 00:52:34,238
Enjoy your food.

527
00:52:34,239 --> 00:52:35,655
Are you feeling better?

528
00:52:35,656 --> 00:52:37,599
You've gotten prettier.

529
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:39,969
Please enjoy your food.

530
00:52:39,970 --> 00:52:41,229
Elder, enjoy your food

531
00:52:41,230 --> 00:52:43,688
We'll enjoy it.

532
00:52:44,664 --> 00:52:45,617
I'll do it.

533
00:52:45,617 --> 00:52:46,617
Yes.

534
00:52:56,685 --> 00:53:00,323
Hey, I'm a CEO, too.

535
00:53:00,324 --> 00:53:04,986
Our restaurant is very busy.

536
00:53:12,044 --> 00:53:16,023
Alright! I'll come soon!

537
00:53:19,363 --> 00:53:23,455
You're going to wear out your cell phone.

538
00:53:26,293 --> 00:53:32,359
What was it... That kitchen
youngster has returned to Korea.

539
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:34,732
Did you get a call from him?

540
00:53:34,733 --> 00:53:37,251
Why would he contact me?

541
00:53:37,252 --> 00:53:39,790
I have nothing to do with him.

542
00:53:39,791 --> 00:53:43,899
I told you from the beginning
that he was not for you.

543
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:47,637
Just looking at him, he
looks like he's not steady.

544
00:53:47,638 --> 00:53:50,499
That's why I liked my son-in-law Choi...

545
00:53:56,561 --> 00:53:58,585
Kim Ahjussi!

546
00:53:58,586 --> 00:54:00,824
What are you doing at this hour?

547
00:54:00,825 --> 00:54:03,822
Perhaps, did you quit?

548
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:06,353
Work was too hard there.

549
00:54:06,354 --> 00:54:10,494
Ahjussi! I introduced you
there only a short time ago.

550
00:54:10,495 --> 00:54:14,254
Can I just stay here, and help out?

551
00:54:14,255 --> 00:54:17,239
Nope. Our motto is

552
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:20,281
only people who work can eat. You remember?

553
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:25,590
You can pay back today's free meal.

554
00:54:25,591 --> 00:54:31,796
After you eat, please wash all
those dirty dishes thoroughly.

555
00:54:34,149 --> 00:54:37,423
Aren't you asking a bit much for a meal?

556
00:54:37,896 --> 00:54:42,110
Do you want me to count how
many meals you had here?

557
00:54:42,111 --> 00:54:46,608
Alright. Alright. I'll
wash them thoroughly.

558
00:54:49,613 --> 00:54:51,362
Go find a job quickly.

559
00:54:51,363 --> 00:54:54,603
You'll get really tired
if you stay around her.

560
00:54:54,604 --> 00:54:57,691
She's really tough.

561
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:12,908
Yes?

562
00:55:12,909 --> 00:55:14,352
<i>Son...</i>

563
00:55:17,232 --> 00:55:18,914
What is it now?

564
00:55:18,915 --> 00:55:22,736
Don't worry, my son.

565
00:55:22,737 --> 00:55:27,441
I'm making a schedule without
interfering with your health.

566
00:55:27,442 --> 00:55:30,006
How long are you staying in Korea?

567
00:55:30,007 --> 00:55:34,562
Can you ask how he feels about
finishing the last show?

568
00:55:34,563 --> 00:55:36,616
I'm leaving tomorrow.

569
00:55:36,617 --> 00:55:40,365
You're really leaving tomorrow?

570
00:55:44,384 --> 00:55:47,916
I told you to stop by Sanarae this time.

571
00:55:47,917 --> 00:55:50,144
Oh, really?

572
00:56:17,388 --> 00:56:18,546
Omo... omo

573
00:56:20,558 --> 00:56:23,855
I'll do it.

574
00:56:31,753 --> 00:56:34,879
How did our Head Chef change like this?

575
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,398
This is betrayal and bias.

576
00:56:37,399 --> 00:56:39,566
Why? It looks nice.

577
00:56:39,567 --> 00:56:41,939
Right. It looks really nice.

578
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:44,597
That's right. After they went out,

579
00:56:44,598 --> 00:56:47,255
the kitchen atmosphere
became heartwarming also.

580
00:56:47,256 --> 00:56:48,686
Heartwarming?!?

581
00:56:48,687 --> 00:56:50,118
More like chaotic!

582
00:56:51,102 --> 00:56:54,345
Sous Chef, when are you going to feed us
noodles? (When are you going to get married.)

583
00:56:54,346 --> 00:56:56,448
Ask my Do Shik ssi.

584
00:56:56,449 --> 00:56:58,811
Do Shik ssi, when are we going to eat nood-

585
00:56:58,812 --> 00:57:05,216
You're on duty. Anything not pertaining
to work is off limits. Do you understand?

586
00:57:07,414 --> 00:57:11,154
Do you understand?!

587
00:57:11,155 --> 00:57:14,655
Who is making our Head Chef
to raise his voice like that?

588
00:57:14,656 --> 00:57:18,244
Ah, Master Chef!

589
00:57:20,704 --> 00:57:23,878
Today we're opening the GeumChungJang.

590
00:57:23,879 --> 00:57:25,337
Please prepare for what we

591
00:57:25,338 --> 00:57:26,797
discussed without any mistakes.

592
00:57:26,798 --> 00:57:28,761
Yes.

593
00:57:28,762 --> 00:57:32,543
You heard what Master Chef said.
You have just one hour left.

594
00:57:32,544 --> 00:57:35,239
Everyone let's get to work

595
00:58:00,174 --> 00:58:01,526
It's delicious.

596
00:58:16,685 --> 00:58:19,763
You've done well.

597
00:58:19,764 --> 00:58:23,508
You worked hard.

598
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:53,393
Thank you

599
00:58:53,394 --> 00:58:55,128
Thank you.

600
00:58:59,008 --> 00:59:01,748
Thanks for working hard.

601
00:59:23,609 --> 00:59:27,040
You really became a star now, huh?

602
00:59:30,065 --> 00:59:34,506
Anyways, where is CEO Go?
