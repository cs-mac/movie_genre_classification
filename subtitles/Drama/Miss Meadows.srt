1
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:31,726
Beautiful day.

2
00:01:32,626 --> 00:01:33,894
Yes, it certainly is.

3
00:01:33,994 --> 00:01:36,864
- That's a pretty dress.
- Thank you.

4
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:38,332
What you reading?

5
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:42,002
- Poetry.
- I know a poem. Want to hear it?

6
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,497
- No, thanks.
- I love Little Pussy.

7
00:01:44,598 --> 00:01:49,576
Her fur is so warm. And if I don't
hurt her, she'll do me no harm.

8
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:54,514
What's the matter, don't you like it?
Hey, why don't you and I get some lunch

9
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,850
and you could read some
of those poems to me?

10
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,685
No, thank you.
I prefer to read silently.

11
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:02,622
Oh, 'cause I'm real hungry
and I hate to eat alone.

12
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:06,193
Then perhaps a cafeteria-style
diner would suit your needs.

13
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,195
Think you're pretty cute, don't you?

14
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:10,497
My mother says I have a
certain kind of loveliness

15
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:14,468
though I believe in the Anasazi Indians
that the face is for others to look at.

16
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:16,003
Get in.

17
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:19,539
I'm going to walk away now.
I suggest you let me.

18
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:21,539
Get in!

19
00:02:23,777 --> 00:02:27,145
- Are you threatening me?
- Get in!

20
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:33,887
Toodle-oo.

21
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:52,906
Who saw him die? "I,"
said the fly, "With my little eye."

22
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,793
Mother dear, how do we
get blood out again?

23
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:57,697
<i>I told you, dear. Lemon juice
with equal parts ice water.</i>

24
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,100
<i>If you let it soak long enough,
no one'll know the difference.</i>

25
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,636
- It'll be our little secret.
- We have so many, Mother dear.

26
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:05,672
Now, tell Mother.

27
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:09,509
<i>Don't fib. Did you accidentally
cut yourself with a knife again?</i>

28
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:12,178
No, but don't worry
about me, Mother dear.

29
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:16,316
- Oh, Mother never stops her worry, Mary.
- You always say that.

30
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:19,719
- 'Cause it's always true.
- I can take care of myself.

31
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,822
So... what does my little big girl
plan on doing today?

32
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:26,291
I am substitute-teaching
in a low-income,

33
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:30,063
racially mixed bottom-scoring,
first-grade classroom.

34
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:34,401
Oh, you poor darling.
You could have run a charm school

35
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:37,904
in a soon-to-be bankrupt department
store or been president.

36
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,839
But that wasn't my destiny, Mother.

37
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:43,076
Well, I hardly think your destiny
is being a temporary teacher.

38
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:46,212
Well, no one knows their
destiny except... God

39
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:49,749
or... a best-selling author.

40
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:53,486
Well, I just don't understand why
you don't something more permanent.

41
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:55,422
Permanence is temporary, Mother dear.

42
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,892
Well, I suppose there's
some truth in that, Mary.

43
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:00,694
The truth is relative.

44
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:04,364
<i>- I guess I should let you go.</i>
- You'll never let me go.

45
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:08,733
- Toodle-oo. I love you.
- Toodle-oo. I love you too.

46
00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:32,158
<i>Life is mostly froth and bubble.
Two things stand like stone...</i>

47
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:37,330
kindness in another's trouble
and courage in your own.

48
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:40,467
What the author in this
book is trying to tell us,

49
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:45,538
that no matter what the most important
things in life are kindness and courage.

50
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:48,475
Who can tell me an example
of courage in their own lives?

51
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,710
- Miss Meadows, Miss Meadows!
- Gordon?

52
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,881
- Mrs. Meadows?
- It's Miss Meadows. Let's continue.

53
00:06:53,981 --> 00:06:57,583
If you're a "miss," does that
mean you miss having a husband?

54
00:06:57,683 --> 00:06:59,819
Well, that's one interpretation.

55
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:05,992
Although the other is that I prefer it
that way because I have all of you.

56
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:08,996
So who has an example for me?

57
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:10,997
Wow!

58
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,398
You thought of one, Heather?

59
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:15,635
Can I take a snack break now?

60
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:21,239
No, not yet. Can I help you
find an example of courage?

61
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,077
Well, Mrs. Dodd left us.

62
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:26,346
Well, Mrs. Dodd isn't here right now.
Miss Meadows is.

63
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,948
She's never coming back.

64
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:31,284
- Of course she is.
- No, she's not!

65
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:34,821
My grandma had the same
thing she does and she died.

66
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:39,824
I saw her in her coffin.
She looked like string cheese.

67
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:51,437
Well, it sounds like Mrs. Dodd
is an example of courage.

68
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:54,641
How about we make "get well soon"
cards for Mrs. Dodd

69
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:58,878
and I will personally see that she gets
them? Are we doing colored or plain?

70
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:02,849
- Plain. Colored!
- Plain... oh, my goodness!

71
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:06,986
Mrs. Dodd's got the Big C. Don't fill
those children's minds with false hope.

72
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:10,723
There are over 13 million cancer
survivors throughout the world.

73
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,992
The only thing false is
not having any hope.

74
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:15,795
- Is that a fact?
- Yes, for verification,

75
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:19,065
you can contact the
American Cancer Society.

76
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:23,234
Alright, Miss Meadows.
I've had it up to here with you.

77
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:29,544
Perhaps you're confusing me with the
scarf around your neck that's in danger

78
00:08:29,645 --> 00:08:34,380
of becoming a tourniquet.
I shall return to Mrs. Dodd's class.

79
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,185
The children don't need any
more changes right now.

80
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,654
I shall give them as much
consistency as I can

81
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:44,257
which might serve to reassure
them in these troubled times.

82
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:48,428
- Go home. Your check's in the mail.
- I seriously doubt that.

83
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:54,099
I rarely receive any checks
through the mail. Toodle-oo.

84
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:42,548
- Good morning, Mrs. Davenport.
- Good morning, Miss Meadows.

85
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:47,287
Oh! Your garden looks especially
perky today. What's your secret?

86
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:53,793
Honestly, coffee grinds
and meticulous weeding.

87
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:55,228
- Really?
- Yeah.

88
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:59,632
Alright, I'm gonna have to try that.
I just have to say, Miss Meadows,

89
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:02,168
it is such a pleasure having
you in the neighbourhood.

90
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:05,905
Ever since you've moved here,
things just feel different.

91
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:07,573
For the better, I hope.

92
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:11,144
Oh, yes! I mean, it's a
pleasure to live here again.

93
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:14,113
I do hope you'll renew your
lease and stay for good.

94
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:17,082
Stay for good? Good to stay.

95
00:10:17,782 --> 00:10:19,986
What doth the bluebird say?

96
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:31,431
Miss Meadows, a new
dentist joined Doug's practice

97
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:36,003
and he's available and we thought
we might fix you two up.

98
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,972
Thank you. But I
don't need a dentist.

99
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:44,711
Oh no, I just meant... well, I don't
want you to end up an old maid.

100
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:49,682
That's impossible.
I don't clean houses for a living.

101
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:53,219
And I have no intentions to
start domestication training.

102
00:10:54,319 --> 00:10:57,657
- Okay.
- But thank you. Ooh...

103
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:27,485
Careful on the thorns. Toodle-oo.

104
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:53,880
Oh, it's okay.

105
00:11:57,283 --> 00:12:00,219
Okay. No broken legs.

106
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:03,055
Good job. Yeah.

107
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:04,555
Excuse me, miss.

108
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:08,262
Hello, Sheriff.

109
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:13,599
Do you have any idea
why I pulled over?

110
00:12:14,299 --> 00:12:18,004
Yes. I parked my vehicle illegally
in the middle of the road

111
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:22,975
which causes the same safety hazard
as leaving a vehicle unoccupied.

112
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:26,645
But I was concerned for
the safety of this toad.

113
00:12:27,045 --> 00:12:29,481
And there was no on-street parking.

114
00:12:29,681 --> 00:12:32,985
Do you think if I kissed it,
it would turn into a prince?

115
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:37,958
Maybe.

116
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:41,127
Or it'll just be one lucky toad.

117
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:44,697
This is a '56 Metropolitan Nash?

118
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:47,767
Yeah, it reminds me of an old
pair of saddle shoes I once had.

119
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:50,503
Reminds me of my
grandmother's kitchen floor.

120
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:55,674
- So clean you could eat dinner off it.
- I prefer a table setting.

121
00:12:56,074 --> 00:12:57,643
Right.

122
00:12:58,243 --> 00:13:00,446
Can you... one... don't move.

123
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:06,283
Do you think that's really true? That you
can make a difference in this world?

124
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:13,591
I think it's impossible not to try.

125
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:17,027
I feel the exact same way.

126
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:23,169
- What is it you do for a living?
- I teach kids.

127
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:26,604
- Oh, that's nice.
- My pleasure.

128
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:32,845
Alright, so I think
I'm gonna let you off

129
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:35,448
- with a warning this time, Miss...
- Meadows.

130
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:38,184
- Meadows. That's a beautiful name.
- Thank you.

131
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:39,652
Can I ask where you're from?

132
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:44,722
"Can ask" is if you're physically
able; "may ask" is permission.

133
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,393
Toodle-oo, Sheriff.

134
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:53,831
Ca...carry on.

135
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:16,188
I know it's hard but although
Mrs. Dodd has left this world

136
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:19,592
and is teaching in another,
we're never going to forget her, right?

137
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:23,229
And she's never going to
forget any one of you.

138
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:30,002
I can feel her spirit in this classroom
right now, especially if I close my eyes.

139
00:14:31,202 --> 00:14:33,339
I see her.

140
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:38,210
She's wearing that blue dress.
She looks so pretty.

141
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:40,947
And she's smiling at all of you.
Do you see it?

142
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:44,283
- Yeah.
- Do you see her pretty smile?

143
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,985
Yeah.

144
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:48,287
See, we're starting to remember her.

145
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:51,724
If we do this every single day,
she'll always be with us.

146
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:54,560
- Okay?
- Yeah.

147
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:58,598
You're probably wondering why I
passed your cards back out?

148
00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:03,970
I was thinking that we
should paste them, each one
to its own balloon,

149
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:07,239
and then one day,
we're going to release them.

150
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:08,872
Yeah.

151
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:13,446
- You said she'd come back.
- I know, sweetheart.

152
00:15:15,046 --> 00:15:18,551
I was wrong. Sometimes
Miss Meadows...

153
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:20,753
Lie! You lied!

154
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:24,957
Heather. Excuse me, children.
Why don't you get started?

155
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:27,260
Heather, sweetheart.

156
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,730
Heather, sweetheart. Heather.

157
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,165
Come here, come here. Heather.

158
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:36,502
It's okay, sweetie. I'm so sorry.

159
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,572
I'm so sorry.

160
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:44,310
All the bad people stay
and all the good ones die.

161
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:48,914
I hate the world.
It's a terrible place.

162
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:53,519
I know. Sometimes it
is but not all the time.

163
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,389
And it's our responsibility...

164
00:15:57,689 --> 00:15:59,627
to make it a better place.

165
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:07,833
Hey, Miss Meadows, do you
want to come to Happy Hour?

166
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:09,301
Hey, Katharine.

167
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:11,704
I don't see how Happy Hour will
make much of a difference...

168
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:15,975
- Bye, Miss Meadows. I like your outfit.
- Well, thank you. Have a good afternoon.

169
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:17,543
Toodle-oo.

170
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,712
Miss Meadows.

171
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:23,149
- May I?
- Sheriff.

172
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:25,885
An absolutely splendid edition
that is essential to all.

173
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:29,186
If this doesn't make
you proper, nothing will.

174
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:38,695
Thank you.

175
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,036
I've always wanted my own copy.

176
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:00,920
A sentence contains
no unnecessary words,

177
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,323
a paragraph no unnecessary sentences.

178
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:06,859
Make every word tell.

179
00:17:08,259 --> 00:17:12,765
I would like to take you
for an afternoon spin

180
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:17,234
in my 1970 classic
Chevrolet pickup truck.

181
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:27,478
I would like that very much.

182
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:34,053
How, may I ask,
do you know where I work?

183
00:17:35,753 --> 00:17:37,454
I ran your plate.

184
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,326
Your work address came up. I...

185
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:49,034
- That's illegal.
- Yes, it is. I feel really bad.

186
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:52,638
I just... I couldn't stop thinking
about this girl

187
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,627
in the middle of the
road holding a toad.

188
00:17:55,728 --> 00:18:00,711
Dead right, I'm sorry. I apologize
to you. I broke the rules.

189
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:09,021
I think it's okay to break
the rules sometimes.

190
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:10,353
Good.

191
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,790
You tell your kids that?

192
00:18:16,996 --> 00:18:18,164
What?

193
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:21,164
That it's okay to break
the rules sometimes?

194
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:28,341
Well, I remind them
of their goodness.

195
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,974
How to...

196
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:36,415
protect themselves if they're around
someone that they don't think is good.

197
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:38,682
I like that.

198
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:45,655
Listen, if kids aren't safe, if they
don't feel safe, we're all lost.

199
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:57,269
- I like the rain.
- Why?

200
00:18:57,869 --> 00:19:00,169
Makes me feel clean.

201
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:06,212
I bought this property
a few years ago.

202
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:11,148
And right here, this is where I figured
I would build a house one day.

203
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:16,355
- Do you have a contractor's license?
- No, I don't have a contractor's license

204
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:19,358
but I will hire someone
to help me, so thank you.

205
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,758
Butterscotch or liquorice?

206
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:37,477
Sheriff, what may I ask made you
choose law enforcement as your career?

207
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:41,413
- Fear.
- Of what?

208
00:19:41,913 --> 00:19:45,073
It's a career choice motivated by the
soul-numbing fear that I might end up

209
00:19:45,174 --> 00:19:48,285
- like the rest of my family.
- What does that mean?

210
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:53,824
Are you familiar with
the term convicts?

211
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,996
So you have bad blood.

212
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:06,038
I don't know if I'd call it that.
Why did you start teaching?

213
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:08,941
- I'm asking you the questions.
- Oh, really? Okay.

214
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,310
So what's your second...

215
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:14,646
career choice?

216
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:21,553
- You have to promise not to laugh.
- No.

217
00:20:22,453 --> 00:20:23,953
No?

218
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,026
- You want me to take a risk?
- Yes, please.

219
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,265
Professional accordion player.

220
00:20:34,765 --> 00:20:35,899
Why?

221
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:42,575
Why not? I think it has
this obscure beauty.

222
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:44,711
It's misunderstood.

223
00:20:46,711 --> 00:20:52,917
Did you know that the accordion is
the second least-appreciated musical
instrument

224
00:20:53,117 --> 00:20:57,522
right ahead of the bagpipe and right
behind the dead-kitten flute?

225
00:20:57,622 --> 00:21:00,891
No, I did not know that
until right this very moment.

226
00:21:18,077 --> 00:21:22,481
- What may I ask are you doing?
- I'm dancing to your accordion.

227
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:26,353
I'm not that good.

228
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:29,089
It's a work in progress.

229
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:32,021
Isn't everything?

230
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:35,387
Thank you for the... the spin
and the snack.

231
00:22:36,187 --> 00:22:38,387
You're very welcome.

232
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,598
Miss Meadows.

233
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,698
Yes?

234
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:53,403
- May I...
- Yes.

235
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:28,205
Right.

236
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:35,147
That's gonna cover that
top window pane, right?

237
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,715
- Yep.
- The top and the bottom.

238
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:38,984
Mrs. Davenport, what are you doing?

239
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,453
Oh, better safe than sorry.

240
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:45,324
I'm sorry you don't feel safe. I thought
you said the neighbourhood had improved.

241
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,759
Haven't you been reading
the newspapers?

242
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:51,530
The Department of Corrections
released nearly 2000 prisoners

243
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:54,166
over the last six months
because of "overcrowding."

244
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:57,042
Now they can only account
for 800 of them.

245
00:23:57,143 --> 00:24:01,473
Some say that they've moved
right into this very neighbourhood.

246
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:03,475
My Doug says that
it's unconstitutional

247
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:06,011
to try and stop them.
He says it's the law.

248
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:09,915
Well... you can't live in fear.

249
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:13,685
Oh, Miss Meadows.
You're so young and naive.

250
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:16,788
I dare say I'm neither.
I just appear that way.

251
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:20,593
I hate to say this but I would not
walk around the neighbourhood

252
00:24:20,694 --> 00:24:24,963
in such lovely outfits.
You make yourself a target.

253
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:33,005
Mrs. Davenport, I don't
change my style for anyone.

254
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:35,605
Toodle-oo.

255
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:41,680
Yes, Toodle-oo to you, too.

256
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:44,216
Oh, dear.

257
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:25,557
So, I leave you, my friends,
with a question from Luke.

258
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:28,427
Who are our neighbours?

259
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:33,198
Let's then ask ourselves,
how can we serve them better?

260
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:37,699
Isn't that the example we
want to give our children?

261
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:43,606
Go in peace to love
and serve the Lord.

262
00:25:50,047 --> 00:25:52,849
- Hello, Sheriff.
- Miss Meadows.

263
00:25:55,220 --> 00:26:00,125
Much as I was looking forward
to seeing you, I never imagined
I'd see you here.

264
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:03,793
- Are you Catholic?
- No.

265
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,233
No, thank you.

266
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,908
I like singing in choirs.

267
00:26:11,609 --> 00:26:13,002
You?

268
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:19,278
Recovering. My grandmother used
to take me here when I was a kid.

269
00:26:19,378 --> 00:26:22,398
I used to get kicked out all the time.
And she sat me down

270
00:26:22,499 --> 00:26:26,151
and reminded me that she's the only
one in the family not going to hell.

271
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:29,074
And that if I played my cards right,
she'd take me along with her

272
00:26:29,175 --> 00:26:33,057
which I think is quite
morbid, actually. Anyway,

273
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:36,094
I promised her I'd just show up.

274
00:26:37,394 --> 00:26:39,428
You kept your promise.

275
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,667
I don't make them if
I can't keep them.

276
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,941
I can still taste your kiss.

277
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:10,326
Make a wish.

278
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:25,477
- Is it okay?
- Yeah.

279
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,319
Is that good?

280
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:45,163
- Look at me.
- I'm sorry.

281
00:27:45,263 --> 00:27:47,833
- It feels good.
- Okay.

282
00:27:47,933 --> 00:27:48,593
Okay.

283
00:27:50,494 --> 00:27:53,002
- Look at me.
- Okay.

284
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:38,047
Do you think repeat criminal
offenders can be rehabilitated?

285
00:28:41,552 --> 00:28:43,820
Is this your idea of pillow talk?

286
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,757
Pillows don't talk.

287
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,562
Just... just...

288
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:53,630
- Sorry.
- Okay.

289
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:01,436
Come here. Come here.

290
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:14,119
So do you?

291
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:16,054
Do I?

292
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:19,356
I believe in second chances.

293
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:26,062
I believe in trying but rehabilitation
didn't work for my father.

294
00:29:31,402 --> 00:29:33,438
So why do you do what you do?

295
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:35,407
Okay, why don't we keep
business out of the bedroom?

296
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:38,176
Because the law is
everybody's business.

297
00:29:39,276 --> 00:29:42,247
Is it? Is it?

298
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:44,182
Is the law everybody's
responsibility?

299
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:47,152
- I don't know.
- Yeah.

300
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:52,624
Look at this vigilante case I'm working on.
Part of me admires the guy.

301
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:57,226
But you're never gonna get me to say it out
loud because it's not politically correct.

302
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,310
You know, "politically
correct" is for politicians.

303
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:15,213
And there are bad
people in the world.

304
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:18,314
And they shouldn't be
around the good people.

305
00:30:20,651 --> 00:30:23,685
Especially the little ones.

306
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,499
You're amazing.

307
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:45,541
You look amazing. You are amazing.
That was amazing.

308
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:51,104
Can I ask a question, Miss Meadows?

309
00:30:51,205 --> 00:30:52,982
- Sure.
- Was that amazing for you?

310
00:30:56,488 --> 00:30:57,956
Sheriff,

311
00:30:58,956 --> 00:31:03,994
there are certain things that a lady
doesn't... tell a gentleman.

312
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:15,438
You do have manners.
Don't you, Miss Meadows?

313
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:27,116
What would the world be without them?

314
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:35,824
We'll never forget you, Mrs. Dodd!

315
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:41,398
She's an angel up
there now. Isn't she?

316
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:45,637
Yes, she certainly is.

317
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,607
Would you be our teacher for the
rest of the year, Miss Meadows?

318
00:31:48,707 --> 00:31:52,310
- Oh, no, I'm just your substitute.
- Why don't you stay?

319
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,713
Can we have our snack now?

320
00:31:54,813 --> 00:31:56,414
Yes.

321
00:31:56,514 --> 00:31:59,951
I think that we all have earned a treat.
I'm gonna go get us some hot dogs.

322
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:03,655
You guys stay with Miss Katherine.
Play nicely. I expect good manners.

323
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,997
Hi, I'd like to order
16 Top Dogs, please.

324
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:20,972
Hello.

325
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:34,417
I want to die.

326
00:32:36,654 --> 00:32:39,524
- I think you should.
- What?

327
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:43,094
You're of no use to society. You'll
waste innocent taxpayers' dollars,

328
00:32:43,194 --> 00:32:46,865
abuse the weak legal system and
enter a cowardly plea of insanity

329
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:50,168
to a morally bankrupt
defense attorney. For what?

330
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:55,140
Oh, and once incarcerated, you're gonna cost
taxpayers approximately $47,000 per year.

331
00:32:55,240 --> 00:33:00,679
So you know what? Make sure you point the
barrel of the gun to the back of the throat.

332
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:04,315
- I think I've changed my mind.
- That is so not an option.

333
00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:59,504
- Never fear, Miss Meadows is here.
- Where's our hot dogs?

334
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:05,476
Oh, well, Top Dog is experiencing
some unforeseen problems

335
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:08,913
and when it does, it's important to
have another plan to fall back on.

336
00:34:09,013 --> 00:34:14,218
You know, when one path is blocked,
we simply walk down another path. Right?

337
00:34:14,319 --> 00:34:17,188
- Yes.
- And that's what hope is.

338
00:34:17,288 --> 00:34:20,759
Hope is usually...

339
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:26,131
right around the corner. Just like that
ice cream truck. Ice cream for everyone!

340
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:27,799
- Hey, you.
- Hi.

341
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,934
What kind of flavour
are you gonna get?

342
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:33,938
Same kind as you, Miss Meadows.

343
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:37,776
Miss Meadows, when I grow up,
I want to be just like you.

344
00:34:37,876 --> 00:34:41,646
- Please don't say that, sweetheart.
- Why not?

345
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:45,283
Well, because you should aspire
to be your own individual.

346
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:49,387
You know, grow up and
have your own unique traits.

347
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:52,088
And secret ways, too?

348
00:34:55,759 --> 00:34:58,429
- Pardon me?
- I can keep a secret, Miss Meadows.

349
00:34:58,529 --> 00:35:01,999
But children shouldn't have secrets.
And they shouldn't keep them.

350
00:35:02,299 --> 00:35:06,201
But you spilled something
on your dress.

351
00:35:08,038 --> 00:35:09,007
What?

352
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,841
But you spilled something on
your dress, Miss Meadows.

353
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:17,248
I guess I did.

354
00:35:17,348 --> 00:35:20,952
I dislike that very much.
How about we get some ice cream?

355
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:25,123
Miss Meadows needs some
ice cream right now.

356
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:27,258
- Yay!
- Yeah, let's do it.

357
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:29,961
- What's his name?
- Frank.

358
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:32,063
- Hi, Frankie.
- I said his name is Frank.

359
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:35,098
Children, we mustn't approach
animals that we don't know. Come on.

360
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:38,470
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Always let them come to you.

361
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,670
Always let them come to you.

362
00:35:57,455 --> 00:35:58,790
- Mike.
- Yo.

363
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:00,992
- Heads up.
- What?

364
00:36:01,892 --> 00:36:03,227
Nice catch.

365
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:07,165
Hey listen, we've been compiling the case
information from the other jurisdictions

366
00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:09,734
and we've got a composite
on the vigilante.

367
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:13,404
And it looks like some kind of a...

368
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,873
Pulp Fiction Mary Poppins.

369
00:36:16,073 --> 00:36:19,377
Now, personally I'm not buying
that a woman is pulling all this off.

370
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:22,729
I mean, not that they're not capable
of it. Clearly Michelle is batshit

371
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:24,415
before her period comes.

372
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:26,582
- Danny, thank you.
- You got it.

373
00:36:30,088 --> 00:36:32,254
And can I get the ball back?

374
00:36:34,058 --> 00:36:35,925
Thought I taught
you better than that.

375
00:37:18,202 --> 00:37:21,272
Good afternoon, Sheriff.

376
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:22,573
Miss Meadows.

377
00:37:24,273 --> 00:37:26,074
How you doing?

378
00:37:27,845 --> 00:37:29,745
You look beautiful.

379
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:32,748
I got you something.

380
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:40,892
Wow. I love yellow.

381
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:43,494
I hope so. I stole it
from your front yard.

382
00:37:48,966 --> 00:37:51,436
So I thought maybe we could talk?

383
00:37:51,536 --> 00:37:55,473
- Yeah, it's a lovely day.
- It is a lovely day.

384
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:57,773
And this is a lovely door.

385
00:38:13,592 --> 00:38:16,160
You always wear those on your shoes?

386
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,293
Yeah.

387
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,935
Oh, this needs some work.

388
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:26,637
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. You?

389
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:31,340
Good, yes. I'm fine. I'm just asking...
there was a shooting near the school
today.

390
00:38:32,276 --> 00:38:36,681
And civilians were massacred.
The alleged shooter was killed also.

391
00:38:37,781 --> 00:38:42,288
- Excellent.
- Excellent? That's a good thing?

392
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,187
Yeah.

393
00:38:47,224 --> 00:38:50,161
Wait, I'm... I'm confused, Sheriff.

394
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:53,795
You just said that
civilians were killed.

395
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:58,268
What's the concern over
how the shooter died?

396
00:38:58,368 --> 00:39:00,571
Oh, no. My concern is about you.

397
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:03,508
There was an ice cream vendor
who said there was

398
00:39:03,608 --> 00:39:07,678
children from your school there right
around the time of the shooting.

399
00:39:19,223 --> 00:39:21,660
- Vanilla chocolate chip.
- Excuse me?

400
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,647
That's my favourite flavour and
they said that they will have it

401
00:39:24,748 --> 00:39:27,229
restocked by tomorrow.

402
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:34,070
- What's your favourite?
- Vanilla chocolate chip.

403
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:42,380
Then maybe we could
go together sometime.

404
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,736
- I'd like that. Do you like cones?
- Yeah.

405
00:39:46,837 --> 00:39:49,340
Good. I like the cones.
I feel a little goofy

406
00:39:49,441 --> 00:39:53,257
when I'm walking down the street
holding one but the uniform helps.

407
00:39:54,825 --> 00:39:57,294
Where did you live
before you moved here?

408
00:39:57,394 --> 00:40:01,433
- Somewhere else.
- Like Dayton?

409
00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:05,469
No. I didn't like Dayton.

410
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,135
So you did live there.

411
00:40:08,805 --> 00:40:10,540
Why do you want to know?

412
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:15,128
Well, there was just other
vigilante-style killings there
and I thought maybe

413
00:40:15,229 --> 00:40:18,514
- you'd heard of them.
- Nope.

414
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:23,353
No.

415
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:30,792
I moved here five and
a half months ago.

416
00:40:37,335 --> 00:40:40,072
Is there something
you're not telling me?

417
00:40:42,572 --> 00:40:45,774
There are a lot of things
I'm not telling you, Sheriff.

418
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:52,216
<i>Elements of Style's</i> 17th instruction
recommends to omit...

419
00:40:53,116 --> 00:40:55,316
needless words.

420
00:40:57,321 --> 00:40:58,521
Okay.

421
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:16,951
Sheriff, can you do me a
favour please? I want to know

422
00:41:17,052 --> 00:41:20,643
if any of the newly released convicts
have moved into this neighbourhood.

423
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:26,718
- Why?
- For the school, for the kids.

424
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:30,986
And I've seen someone lurking
about and he makes me...

425
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:36,221
- uncomfortable.
- Okay, who?

426
00:41:36,322 --> 00:41:39,497
- Someone said anything to you?
- No.

427
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:42,631
- Nothing's happened?
- No.

428
00:41:46,203 --> 00:41:47,970
I'll look into it.

429
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:54,345
I should go back to...

430
00:41:54,945 --> 00:41:56,912
work, so...

431
00:42:03,186 --> 00:42:06,355
You're killing me.
I can't sleep at night.

432
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:09,591
Toodle-oo.

433
00:42:20,437 --> 00:42:24,242
You're a vital young woman.
Don't worry.

434
00:42:24,342 --> 00:42:26,912
A mother never stops her worry.

435
00:42:28,112 --> 00:42:30,381
- Is it fair?
- What's that, Miss Meadows?

436
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:33,849
To bring a child into this world?

437
00:42:36,987 --> 00:42:40,922
I tell all my patients, if you make your
home a loving, stable environment,

438
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:43,443
that's all a child needs to thrive.

439
00:42:43,826 --> 00:42:46,461
- How big is it?
- About the size of your thumbnail.

440
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:04,813
Wait.

441
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,589
Toodle-oo.

442
00:43:14,558 --> 00:43:16,761
Frank, shut up.

443
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:26,771
Frank, I said shut up!

444
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,774
Sit down!

445
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:36,480
That's him. I've seen him
walking with his dog.

446
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:39,751
He was convicted of
felony child abuse.

447
00:43:49,093 --> 00:43:52,462
That's a nice purse
you have, by the way.

448
00:43:52,562 --> 00:43:54,117
Thank you.

449
00:43:54,797 --> 00:43:59,203
My mother says a lady never leaves home
without her accessories. I agree with her.

450
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:03,341
You don't talk about your
mother much. What's she like?

451
00:44:03,941 --> 00:44:07,311
Peanut brittle. Maybe artichokes.

452
00:44:07,411 --> 00:44:11,048
In that rare exception, a clean
public restroom, which I agree with.

453
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:12,150
- Miss Meadows?
- Yes.

454
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:13,651
- May I ask you a question?
- Sure.

455
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:15,886
What do you do when
you're not working?

456
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:21,025
My hobbies. You know, my gardening.
Takes a lot of time.

457
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:26,997
And knitting, and sometimes I paint.
And then there's my volunteer work.

458
00:44:27,097 --> 00:44:30,201
Can you be a little more
vague, maybe? Today.

459
00:44:30,301 --> 00:44:33,234
What did you do when
you got off work today?

460
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:40,942
Sheriff,

461
00:44:44,881 --> 00:44:50,285
I went to the fabric store, and I
got some yarn and knitting needles.

462
00:44:53,557 --> 00:44:55,757
And I started making a blanket.

463
00:44:59,964 --> 00:45:04,266
A baby blanket... for our baby.

464
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:17,716
Why didn't you tell me?

465
00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:20,449
I just did.

466
00:45:24,321 --> 00:45:26,958
Do you know what this means?

467
00:45:28,758 --> 00:45:32,861
Yeah. I don't... I don't know.

468
00:45:33,898 --> 00:45:35,698
Look at me.

469
00:45:39,203 --> 00:45:41,270
Miss Meadows...

470
00:45:44,808 --> 00:45:46,444
I want you to marry me.

471
00:45:47,544 --> 00:45:48,980
Me?

472
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:51,146
Yes, you.

473
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:57,886
- You don't know me.
- I know everything I need to know.

474
00:46:00,824 --> 00:46:02,592
I'll take care of you.

475
00:46:03,092 --> 00:46:07,729
It would be the highest honor of
my life to protect you and this child.

476
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:14,870
Really?

477
00:46:19,209 --> 00:46:20,742
Please.

478
00:46:26,516 --> 00:46:27,616
Yes.

479
00:46:28,852 --> 00:46:30,552
Yes!

480
00:47:09,627 --> 00:47:11,230
Sheriff...

481
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:15,401
Miss Meadows?

482
00:47:17,801 --> 00:47:21,972
You know marriage has
a certain... ring to it.

483
00:47:22,072 --> 00:47:25,543
You know, a wedding ring,
engagement ring...

484
00:47:25,643 --> 00:47:27,110
suffer-ring.

485
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:29,480
Oh, you have a very
strange sense of humor.

486
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:32,917
- You think I have a sense of humor?
- I do think you have a sense of humor.

487
00:47:33,017 --> 00:47:35,651
- You think I'm funny?
- I think you're strangely funny.

488
00:47:54,004 --> 00:47:56,038
Mother?

489
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:00,879
I met someone.

490
00:48:02,279 --> 00:48:07,281
And he has... kind eyes.

491
00:48:08,118 --> 00:48:12,423
- Just like Grandpa did, remember?
<i>- What are little boys made of?</i>

492
00:48:12,923 --> 00:48:15,492
Frogs and snails and puppy dog tails.

493
00:48:16,092 --> 00:48:20,597
Well, he's not a boy.
He says he's a man.

494
00:48:20,997 --> 00:48:25,369
- That's what they all say.
- Was I a good baby, mother?

495
00:48:26,469 --> 00:48:29,139
Mary... you were a perfect baby.

496
00:48:29,539 --> 00:48:31,244
Mother...

497
00:48:33,844 --> 00:48:36,414
When did I become...

498
00:48:37,214 --> 00:48:40,584
- less perfect?
- You were always perfect to me.

499
00:48:40,684 --> 00:48:42,920
When did I start to realize
that the world was...

500
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:45,222
A rotting cesspool of
decay and mediocrity?

501
00:48:45,322 --> 00:48:49,259
I'd have to say that was when that awful
Mr. Redding tried to bomb the mall.

502
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:52,663
- I thought it was when Uncle Clybert...
- Oh, no. It was years later, honey.

503
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:57,568
And it was before I found Mrs. Hartford
hanging from the theater rafters.

504
00:48:57,668 --> 00:49:02,337
Oh, I still think that was a shame.
She has such a beautiful singing voice.

505
00:49:07,077 --> 00:49:08,813
Or maybe it was...

506
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:34,335
All... through... the town...

507
00:49:35,939 --> 00:49:39,674
The wipers on the bus go
swish, swish, swish...

508
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:45,149
Swish, swish, swish...
swish, swish, swish...

509
00:49:45,249 --> 00:49:50,352
The wipers on the bus go
swish, swish, swish...

510
00:49:52,189 --> 00:49:55,690
All... through... the town...

511
00:50:07,705 --> 00:50:10,743
- I did it.
- Of course you did.

512
00:50:10,844 --> 00:50:14,078
- You can do anything.
- I can?

513
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:17,416
Hey, come here.

514
00:50:22,653 --> 00:50:25,589
<i>Mary? Mary?</i>

515
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:27,889
<i>Are you still there?</i>

516
00:50:32,663 --> 00:50:34,932
Mother, I have to go.

517
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:38,602
- Where are you off to now, my love?
- I'm going to have tea with a neighbour.

518
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:40,938
Oh, very good, dear.
Remember, mind your manners.

519
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:46,276
Our time we must not idly waste,
since all our hours fly off in haste.

520
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:51,613
With each new minute I strive to
fill my seven new acts of duty still.

521
00:50:54,351 --> 00:50:58,419
- Toodle-oo, I love you.
- Toodle-oo, I love you too.

522
00:51:24,714 --> 00:51:25,615
You.

523
00:51:26,615 --> 00:51:29,153
- Hello.
- Hello.

524
00:51:29,953 --> 00:51:33,054
I brought some tea and crumpets.

525
00:51:34,191 --> 00:51:37,795
Really? That's nice.

526
00:51:37,895 --> 00:51:40,464
You have no idea how
much that means, Miss?

527
00:51:40,564 --> 00:51:43,832
- Meadows.
- Won't you come in, Miss Meadows.

528
00:51:54,678 --> 00:51:56,478
Please.

529
00:52:01,018 --> 00:52:03,821
You'll have to, excuse the house.

530
00:52:03,921 --> 00:52:06,690
I'm still settling in.

531
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:11,929
- Did you just move to town?
- Yes, just like you, right?

532
00:52:12,229 --> 00:52:14,532
No, I've lived here for months.

533
00:52:15,532 --> 00:52:17,099
Me too.

534
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:26,575
This is so thoughtful. To be honest,
I haven't made a lot of friends yet.

535
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,803
First of all, I wanted to say...

536
00:52:53,603 --> 00:52:56,475
that I try to approach...

537
00:52:58,575 --> 00:53:01,078
every situation...

538
00:53:01,778 --> 00:53:05,781
- hoping for the best.
- What a lovely way to think.

539
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:12,090
And I certainly do hope
that you respect the...

540
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:17,694
peaceful and safe ways that this
community works so hard at,

541
00:53:17,794 --> 00:53:20,230
and they've come to cherish it.

542
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:22,366
I'm looking forward to it.

543
00:53:22,466 --> 00:53:25,769
And I also want you to know that I
know exactly who and what you are,

544
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:30,738
and should you harm anyone,
or any child, you will be killed.

545
00:53:31,441 --> 00:53:33,775
What did you just say?

546
00:53:37,314 --> 00:53:39,180
I said you will be killed.

547
00:53:40,517 --> 00:53:42,684
And just... who's going to kill me?

548
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:49,792
- I am.
- You?

549
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:59,100
Miss Meadows, have no fear. Your message
was received loud and clear.

550
00:54:01,244 --> 00:54:02,579
Good.

551
00:54:07,478 --> 00:54:09,078
Good.

552
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:12,216
That was my intention.

553
00:54:12,416 --> 00:54:16,653
I have to say... we're two peas
in a pod,

554
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:20,321
- and we have a lot in common.
- We have nothing in common.

555
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:31,002
- Actually...
- So now that you've come to visit me,

556
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:35,336
I think I should pay you a
visit at the school sometime.

557
00:54:40,042 --> 00:54:44,349
That is not a good idea.
It won't end well for you.

558
00:54:44,849 --> 00:54:49,768
- Gosh, that sounds like a threat.
- I do not make threats.

559
00:54:50,869 --> 00:54:54,823
I make promises. And only
promises that I intend to keep.

560
00:54:59,229 --> 00:55:02,866
Where are my manners?
Here you are in my house,

561
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:06,703
and I've not even properly introduced
myself. My name is Skylar.

562
00:55:07,003 --> 00:55:09,637
I don't care to know your name.

563
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:15,710
Well, now, who's
forgotten their manners?

564
00:55:19,949 --> 00:55:24,536
What gives you the right to come into my
house, threatening, making accusations,

565
00:55:24,637 --> 00:55:28,155
when I haven't done anything wrong?

566
00:55:28,592 --> 00:55:32,092
That's illegal, Miss Meadows.

567
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:37,835
The truth is not illegal.

568
00:55:38,735 --> 00:55:40,204
Hey.

569
00:55:41,104 --> 00:55:44,738
You have no idea what it's like
to have to start over again.

570
00:55:49,378 --> 00:55:52,280
- I most certainly do.
- Are you forgetting something?

571
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:57,521
My therapist says I have to take
care of myself and my needs

572
00:55:57,621 --> 00:56:01,725
before I can be good for
anyone else. Do you have one?

573
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:05,929
Because... and please don't
take this personally...

574
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:10,333
I think you could really use one. And I
would be happy to make a recommendation,

575
00:56:10,633 --> 00:56:14,201
because... you shouldn't wait.

576
00:56:15,004 --> 00:56:16,905
Toodle-oo.

577
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:38,760
Hey, you.

578
00:57:39,422 --> 00:57:43,160
Even though this is Sunday,
what we discuss in here applies
to every day, Louie.

579
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:44,528
- Miss Meadows?
- Yes?

580
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:47,464
How come Jesus looks like a
fashion model in that picture,

581
00:57:47,564 --> 00:57:50,300
but, like, any better in
my Aunt Bea's bedroom.

582
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:53,270
Well, since Jesus was a
Jew and came from Israel,

583
00:57:53,370 --> 00:57:56,173
my guess is that he looked like
neither one of those paintings.

584
00:57:56,273 --> 00:58:01,011
Those paintings were most probably
done by... an idealistic painter.

585
00:58:07,751 --> 00:58:09,920
- Oh, look at him!
- He's so cute!

586
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:12,389
He looks like he's
about two years old.

587
00:58:13,489 --> 00:58:15,626
That's 16 in a dog life.

588
00:58:16,726 --> 00:58:18,493
Too old for this class.

589
00:58:34,043 --> 00:58:39,914
We were discussing how every day is
Sunday, in terms of how we live, right?

590
00:58:45,288 --> 00:58:48,826
Hey, William, what are
you drawing a picture of?

591
00:58:49,326 --> 00:58:51,591
I don't know.

592
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:57,734
- You don't want to join the other kids?
- I don't know.

593
00:58:57,834 --> 00:59:00,234
Are you feeling okay?

594
00:59:02,605 --> 00:59:06,610
Why does Jesus say to turn the
other cheek when someone hits you?

595
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:10,113
Because he's saying that
that's preferable to fighting.

596
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:15,316
But what if you do turn it, and then he,
like, punches that one too?

597
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:38,406
Miss Meadows has an idea.
How about an early cookie break?

598
00:59:39,810 --> 00:59:42,746
Special one for you.

599
00:59:42,846 --> 00:59:47,427
Amber? I think it's your turn.
You're doing a very nice job.

600
00:59:47,528 --> 00:59:52,256
You're so quiet. One cookie
each, alright? Ooh.

601
00:59:52,856 --> 00:59:54,589
Beautiful.

602
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:59,829
You know you can tell
me anything, right?

603
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:02,432
Are you sure you ran into that wall?

604
01:00:03,032 --> 01:00:06,269
- I have to prepare at church for mass.
- What are you talking about? It's over.

605
01:00:06,369 --> 01:00:07,971
Papa Peter says I have to be there.

606
01:00:08,071 --> 01:00:11,371
He doesn't like it if I'm late.
He says it's a sin!

607
01:00:18,181 --> 01:00:21,719
Stop it! Stop!

608
01:00:25,021 --> 01:00:28,925
- Father!
- The Lord ask that we not judge.

609
01:00:29,025 --> 01:00:31,795
I think he asks more of us than that.

610
01:00:31,895 --> 01:00:34,798
How dare you? How dare you?

611
01:00:34,898 --> 01:00:38,034
- I do God's work!
- Don't you touch him!

612
01:02:14,797 --> 01:02:16,466
- Get out of my bed.
- Boo!

613
01:02:20,770 --> 01:02:22,970
Is that a toy gun?

614
01:02:31,147 --> 01:02:32,916
Guns are not toys, sweetie.

615
01:02:33,016 --> 01:02:36,820
That was a... secret toy?

616
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:39,923
Heather, I'm so sorry.

617
01:02:40,523 --> 01:02:42,225
I hope I didn't frighten you.

618
01:02:42,325 --> 01:02:46,894
Never fear... Miss Meadows is here.

619
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:54,570
- How did you get here?
- I walked.

620
01:02:54,970 --> 01:02:59,375
It was only a couple of blocks.
I wanted to surprise you.

621
01:02:59,575 --> 01:03:01,611
And how did you get in my bed?

622
01:03:01,711 --> 01:03:04,814
It was easy. I just crawled
through the window.

623
01:03:04,914 --> 01:03:08,682
You don't have ugly
bars like everyone else.

624
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:17,658
Miss Meadows?

625
01:03:20,931 --> 01:03:22,733
Can I...

626
01:03:23,433 --> 01:03:26,533
May I... be your flower girl?

627
01:03:28,237 --> 01:03:31,674
- Flower girl?
- Please? Oh, please!

628
01:03:31,774 --> 01:03:33,374
Okay, okay.

629
01:03:38,714 --> 01:03:41,325
I want you to be happy.
If you want to be my flower girl,

630
01:03:41,426 --> 01:03:44,854
- you can be my flower girl.
- It'll be so much fun!

631
01:03:44,954 --> 01:03:47,190
We'll be like best friends.

632
01:03:47,290 --> 01:03:51,891
I could tell you my secrets,
because I already know yours.

633
01:03:54,764 --> 01:03:56,066
Secrets?

634
01:03:56,666 --> 01:04:00,703
- Miss Meadows has a secret.
- What are you talking about?

635
01:04:00,803 --> 01:04:02,972
If I told you, it wouldn't
be a secret anymore.

636
01:04:03,072 --> 01:04:06,309
You have to tell me. It'll be
a secret between you and me.

637
01:04:06,409 --> 01:04:09,212
If I tell you, can I still
be your flower girl?

638
01:04:09,312 --> 01:04:10,880
Yes!

639
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:13,817
Only if you tell me.

640
01:04:14,917 --> 01:04:17,052
I saw you kill that man.

641
01:04:19,789 --> 01:04:21,191
What?

642
01:04:21,791 --> 01:04:24,360
- What man?
- In the Top Dog.

643
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:28,364
I forgot to tell you I
wanted relish on my hotdog,

644
01:04:28,464 --> 01:04:31,732
and I went to the window, and I saw.

645
01:04:53,689 --> 01:04:56,559
You're just a little girl.
You're just a little girl.

646
01:04:56,659 --> 01:05:01,064
You're just a little girl.
You're just a little girl.
You're just a little girl.

647
01:05:01,164 --> 01:05:05,068
You're just a little girl.
I'm so sorry.

648
01:05:05,168 --> 01:05:08,571
I'm so, so, so sorry. I'm so sorry.

649
01:05:08,671 --> 01:05:13,307
I'm so sorry. I'm very, very sorry.

650
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:16,544
I'm so sorry.

651
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:24,954
I still saw. It's okay.

652
01:05:25,354 --> 01:05:28,389
I have to go home now, for dinner.

653
01:05:35,331 --> 01:05:38,267
Why do you lock that
one twice, Miss Meadows?

654
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:45,475
Sometimes Miss Meadows
can be so... silly.

655
01:05:45,575 --> 01:05:47,908
It's not silly to be scared,
Miss Meadows.

656
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:53,918
I'm not scared of anything.

657
01:05:55,418 --> 01:05:57,820
Can I wear gloves like you do?

658
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:00,987
Yes. Come on.

659
01:06:11,768 --> 01:06:13,770
<i>- Hello, Mary.</i>
- Hey, Mommy.

660
01:06:13,870 --> 01:06:16,104
<i>I had a feeling you might call.</i>

661
01:06:18,742 --> 01:06:22,912
Mom... Mom, I'm scared.

662
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:25,582
I think I might...

663
01:06:25,682 --> 01:06:27,616
I might call the police.

664
01:06:27,716 --> 01:06:29,552
<i>- The police?</i>
- Yeah.

665
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:32,922
Mary, how many times must I tell you?

666
01:06:33,022 --> 01:06:36,225
<i>We must never rely on others to
do what we know must be done.</i>

667
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:39,796
<i>We have to take it upon ourselves
to right the wrongs of this world.</i>

668
01:06:39,896 --> 01:06:43,666
If a woman's tongue is her sword,
just think what her body can do.

669
01:06:43,766 --> 01:06:45,936
But...

670
01:06:46,636 --> 01:06:50,863
our bodies can bring new life, right?
I mean, that too, right?

671
01:06:50,964 --> 01:06:53,176
- Right?
<i>- Sometimes.</i>

672
01:06:53,876 --> 01:06:55,545
It can also take it away.

673
01:06:55,645 --> 01:06:59,415
- Isn't that up to God?
- Oh, Mary, here you go again.

674
01:06:59,515 --> 01:07:01,751
<i>We don't want to rely on
the overburdened heavens</i>

675
01:07:01,851 --> 01:07:04,885
<i>to give everyone their
retribution, now, do we?</i>

676
01:07:06,789 --> 01:07:08,293
Mom...

677
01:07:10,193 --> 01:07:12,560
Mom, I almost...

678
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:20,036
I'm gonna have a...

679
01:07:20,336 --> 01:07:23,136
I'm gonna have a baby.

680
01:07:25,308 --> 01:07:29,710
Me. I'm gonna... I'm gonna
have a baby.

681
01:07:32,982 --> 01:07:35,015
I'm gonna have a...

682
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:42,423
I'm gonna have a wedding!

683
01:07:59,542 --> 01:08:01,811
Are we supposed to forgive everyone?

684
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:02,912
Mommy...

685
01:08:03,012 --> 01:08:07,984
<i>Not everyone, my love.
Some things are unforgivable.</i>

686
01:08:13,689 --> 01:08:16,793
Today, we bid our dear
Mother Meadows goodbye.

687
01:08:16,893 --> 01:08:21,597
Lost to another act
of senseless, random violence.

688
01:08:21,697 --> 01:08:24,634
She leaves behind her pride and joy.

689
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:30,139
Little Mary. Let us all pray
for good to triumph over evil,

690
01:08:30,239 --> 01:08:35,108
and let us pray that some thing
or someone will guide us on.

691
01:08:36,145 --> 01:08:40,149
So am I... am I always gonna be
the black sheep?

692
01:08:40,449 --> 01:08:44,420
- <i>Yes, dear.</i>
- Okay. But I don't want to be.

693
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:48,524
<i>Oh, now, now... there, there...</i>

694
01:08:48,624 --> 01:08:52,295
<i>Just remember... black sheep
are still lambs.</i>

695
01:08:52,395 --> 01:08:55,395
Mommy? Mother?

696
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:59,600
I miss you.

697
01:09:03,406 --> 01:09:06,039
But I'm gonna let you go now.

698
01:09:08,544 --> 01:09:11,111
I'm gonna let you go now.

699
01:09:16,752 --> 01:09:19,586
I'm gonna let you go now.

700
01:09:34,303 --> 01:09:36,038
- Hey, Mike?
- Yeah.

701
01:09:36,138 --> 01:09:37,673
- Got your ballistics report.
- Great.

702
01:09:37,773 --> 01:09:39,909
- Looks like we got a match.
- Right on.

703
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:42,845
The truck driver and the Top
Dog kid, and now the priest,

704
01:09:42,945 --> 01:09:46,883
all with a .25 caliber short-barreled
pistol. Same gun.

705
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:49,650
- Okay.
- Oh, and there's this.

706
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:59,395
It appears Father Peter
was a serial child molester.

707
01:09:59,495 --> 01:10:03,132
And now a bunch of kids are coming
forward claiming sexual abuse.

708
01:10:03,332 --> 01:10:06,938
Nobody misses a pervert. If you
ask me, this guy's lucky he's dead.

709
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:13,175
Anyway. Oh, hey, we got
the wedding invitations too.

710
01:10:13,275 --> 01:10:16,879
- That didn't take long, did it?
- I guess when you know, you know.

711
01:10:16,979 --> 01:10:19,181
- Danny.
- Yeah.

712
01:10:19,281 --> 01:10:22,184
Was there anything about Michelle
that would've been a deal breaker?

713
01:10:22,884 --> 01:10:27,688
Maybe if she was a Steelers fan.
That probably would've done it.

714
01:10:42,304 --> 01:10:45,441
The baby has grown since
I started making this.

715
01:10:45,541 --> 01:10:49,879
I had to let out the seam.
Can you tell?

716
01:10:49,979 --> 01:10:52,179
I think you look beautiful.

717
01:10:54,717 --> 01:10:56,417
Thanks.

718
01:10:59,855 --> 01:11:02,393
Is your mother coming to the wedding?

719
01:11:04,093 --> 01:11:06,796
My mother doesn't like weddings.

720
01:11:06,896 --> 01:11:10,333
You don't think she'll make
an exception this time?

721
01:11:10,433 --> 01:11:11,767
No.

722
01:11:11,867 --> 01:11:15,135
What mother doesn't want to see
her daughter walk down the aisle?

723
01:11:16,872 --> 01:11:18,439
Mine.

724
01:11:23,612 --> 01:11:25,748
What happened to your shoe?

725
01:11:26,248 --> 01:11:29,483
Oh, it lost a tap.

726
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:37,491
I found this one.

727
01:11:41,597 --> 01:11:46,132
Oh! I've been looking all over
for this. Where did you find it?

728
01:11:48,104 --> 01:11:50,738
It was at the church.

729
01:12:00,950 --> 01:12:04,721
I am gonna just put
that on right now.

730
01:12:05,321 --> 01:12:07,188
Thank you.

731
01:12:26,809 --> 01:12:29,309
Dammit, it's not fitting.

732
01:12:31,147 --> 01:12:35,084
Yeah. That's right.

733
01:12:35,484 --> 01:12:37,884
Because it's not real.

734
01:12:41,924 --> 01:12:44,493
What are you talking about?

735
01:12:44,593 --> 01:12:46,827
It's not real.

736
01:12:49,165 --> 01:12:51,398
None of it is.

737
01:12:54,103 --> 01:12:56,672
Let's stop pretending, okay?

738
01:12:56,772 --> 01:13:01,908
Okay, now, let's stop pretending,
and let's tell the truth, you and I.

739
01:13:03,145 --> 01:13:05,649
Because I know.

740
01:13:06,449 --> 01:13:08,151
I know.

741
01:13:09,651 --> 01:13:12,076
I've been covering.
I've been denying the obvious,

742
01:13:12,177 --> 01:13:15,944
because I would do anything
for you. Anything.

743
01:13:16,745 --> 01:13:18,660
So I need you to do something for me.

744
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:23,264
I need you to promise me you're
going to stop this. Okay?

745
01:13:28,837 --> 01:13:31,174
I can't promise you that.

746
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:35,442
- Do you want cream or sugar?
- What happened to you?

747
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:41,040
You can tell me. You can tell me anything.
If you don't want to tell me,

748
01:13:41,141 --> 01:13:45,588
that's fine too. I'm here. But I
don't know what made you this way.

749
01:13:45,888 --> 01:13:48,824
And I just need you
to stop all this insanity.

750
01:13:48,924 --> 01:13:51,727
It's not insane!
What I do is not insane.

751
01:13:51,827 --> 01:13:56,098
You gotta be kidding me. You're walking
around with a gun in your purse.

752
01:13:56,198 --> 01:13:58,234
I don't know what you're
talking about anymore.

753
01:13:58,334 --> 01:14:00,002
I don't understand
anything you're saying.

754
01:14:00,102 --> 01:14:02,669
You can't talk to me like
a normal human being.

755
01:14:07,076 --> 01:14:09,812
You think I want to do this?
No one else is doing it!

756
01:14:09,912 --> 01:14:11,912
I see that. I'm aware of that.

757
01:14:16,785 --> 01:14:19,822
I mean, it's like the wolf
says to the lion...

758
01:14:19,922 --> 01:14:23,993
Okay, no. No, no, no. Stop, stop, stop.
You can't talk to me like this anymore.

759
01:14:24,093 --> 01:14:26,326
Just talk to me like a normal person.

760
01:14:27,930 --> 01:14:32,802
- I'm trying, okay?
- If you keep doing this...

761
01:14:33,402 --> 01:14:36,872
we're gonna get married
in federal prison.

762
01:14:36,972 --> 01:14:39,672
I don't want to, but I'll do it.

763
01:14:40,876 --> 01:14:42,678
I'll come visit you.

764
01:14:43,478 --> 01:14:45,781
But if you stop...

765
01:14:45,881 --> 01:14:49,449
If you can stop, I can bury this.

766
01:14:50,953 --> 01:14:55,992
Okay? But I need you to say that you
promise me you will never do this again.

767
01:14:56,092 --> 01:14:59,793
I need to know that
you're here with me also.

768
01:15:01,463 --> 01:15:03,766
Can you promise me?

769
01:15:04,266 --> 01:15:06,402
- Yes.
- Yes?

770
01:15:06,502 --> 01:15:07,603
- Yeah.
- You can?

771
01:15:07,703 --> 01:15:08,971
- I promise you.
- Okay.

772
01:15:09,071 --> 01:15:13,240
- Okay, good. Good, good, good.
- I'll...

773
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:18,611
- Sheriff?
- Yes.

774
01:15:21,684 --> 01:15:23,453
I'll try.

775
01:15:24,853 --> 01:15:27,087
I will try.

776
01:15:34,763 --> 01:15:36,601
Here you go.

777
01:15:39,101 --> 01:15:42,004
She's got quite a...

778
01:15:42,304 --> 01:15:44,006
following.

779
01:15:44,306 --> 01:15:47,743
Oh, Miss Meadows, you look so pretty.

780
01:15:47,843 --> 01:15:51,880
Thank you. You look beautiful.

781
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:54,648
Can I see you twirl in that dress?

782
01:15:56,218 --> 01:15:57,453
Wow!

783
01:15:57,553 --> 01:16:00,489
What about your hair?
You should have a flower in it?

784
01:16:00,589 --> 01:16:04,025
- You don't think the veil is enough.
- You need a flower too, for the baby.

785
01:16:04,125 --> 01:16:08,897
What a sweet thought. You know, there is
one single white rose in the back garden.

786
01:16:08,997 --> 01:16:11,333
I'll get it, and then we'll
leave for the church, okay?

787
01:16:11,433 --> 01:16:14,703
Not in your dress. I'll do it.

788
01:16:14,803 --> 01:16:17,139
Oh, no, sweetie, there's thorns.
I'll get it in a second.

789
01:16:17,239 --> 01:16:21,711
I'm a big girl, Miss Meadows.
Besides, I have gloves on. See?

790
01:16:22,211 --> 01:16:24,446
Okay. Go ahead, but be careful.

791
01:16:24,546 --> 01:16:27,649
- Thank you for your help.
- You're welcome.

792
01:16:39,861 --> 01:16:42,864
Heather, it's okay.
I think the veil is enough.

793
01:16:42,964 --> 01:16:47,136
You know, I just remembered that my mom
said it's bad luck to pick the last flower,

794
01:16:47,236 --> 01:16:50,939
and I have this whole bouquet
right here. I'll save it for the baby.

795
01:16:51,039 --> 01:16:53,706
I just don't want to be late.

796
01:16:57,712 --> 01:16:59,281
Heather?

797
01:17:02,584 --> 01:17:05,254
Heather? Heather?!

798
01:17:05,554 --> 01:17:06,953
Heather?

799
01:17:36,952 --> 01:17:37,853
Heather!

800
01:17:37,953 --> 01:17:40,022
- Miss Meadows!
- I got you, sweetie.

801
01:17:40,122 --> 01:17:44,960
Late on your first day. And a
tad overdressed, but oh, well.

802
01:17:45,060 --> 01:17:47,463
- Stop, stop, stop. Give me that.
- No! No!

803
01:17:47,563 --> 01:17:51,200
I will cut your throat. Now,
no offense, Miss Meadows,

804
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:54,234
but you do tend to
over-accessorize.

805
01:17:58,907 --> 01:18:02,011
Sheriff? She's never late.

806
01:18:02,411 --> 01:18:04,311
Never ever.

807
01:18:10,953 --> 01:18:13,389
You wouldn't let me
come to your school.

808
01:18:14,089 --> 01:18:16,492
So I thought I'd bring you to mine.

809
01:18:16,592 --> 01:18:20,161
- I thought you said you changed.
- I did, and then I changed back.

810
01:18:20,761 --> 01:18:23,932
And that's what the system gets
for kicking a kid out of school.

811
01:18:24,032 --> 01:18:26,602
You can't teach an
empty seat, can you?

812
01:18:27,002 --> 01:18:32,107
You know what they say, you spare
the rod, you spoil the child.

813
01:18:32,207 --> 01:18:36,409
- I don't agree with...
- Nobody cares! You're in my classroom!

814
01:18:38,246 --> 01:18:41,647
So you can shut up, okay?

815
01:18:43,584 --> 01:18:46,789
He says he's a teacher,
but I don't believe him.

816
01:18:46,889 --> 01:18:50,158
That's 'cause he's pretending.
He likes pretend, just like you.

817
01:18:50,258 --> 01:18:52,461
Just like Miss Meadows.

818
01:18:52,561 --> 01:18:57,633
Now, Heather, shall we
continue where we left off?

819
01:18:57,733 --> 01:19:01,537
Well, come on. Be excited!

820
01:19:01,637 --> 01:19:05,872
I honestly do not know how
you do this all day long.

821
01:19:10,178 --> 01:19:13,916
Go, go! Go come on, let's go!
We're gonna go come on.

822
01:19:16,718 --> 01:19:18,387
Run, Heather, run!

823
01:19:18,487 --> 01:19:21,925
- Get off me.
- Stop it! Sit down!

824
01:19:23,325 --> 01:19:26,428
- Get off me!
- Sit down. Sit down...

825
01:19:26,528 --> 01:19:31,366
That's it. There we go. There we go.

826
01:19:31,666 --> 01:19:34,617
You really think you could just go
off and live happily ever after,

827
01:19:34,718 --> 01:19:38,574
while the rest of us struggle to
carve out any version of a life?

828
01:19:38,974 --> 01:19:41,807
I'm assuming that's
rhetorical question?

829
01:20:01,296 --> 01:20:04,530
You think you're so
much better than me.

830
01:20:05,267 --> 01:20:07,470
You think you're perfect.

831
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:12,705
You wanna know something?
We're exactly the same.

832
01:20:14,710 --> 01:20:16,976
Exactly.

833
01:20:20,949 --> 01:20:24,117
Help! Help!

834
01:20:27,155 --> 01:20:30,924
He's got Miss Meadows!
He's got Miss Meadows!

835
01:20:33,862 --> 01:20:36,865
No! No! No! No!

836
01:20:36,965 --> 01:20:40,002
- Give it here!
- No! No, give it to me! Give it to me!

837
01:20:40,102 --> 01:20:42,204
Give me my purse! Give it to me!

838
01:20:42,304 --> 01:20:44,573
What's got you in such a fuss?

839
01:20:45,773 --> 01:20:48,077
What have we got here?

840
01:20:52,514 --> 01:20:54,702
- That's why you're so excited.
- No.

841
01:20:54,803 --> 01:20:57,486
- Is this thing real?
- It's not real. It's not real.

842
01:20:57,586 --> 01:21:01,423
- Really? Really? Is it? Is it?
- No, it's not.

843
01:21:02,490 --> 01:21:04,292
Oh, yes, it is real!

844
01:21:04,392 --> 01:21:07,396
- Don't do this.
- Crazy, arrogant...

845
01:21:07,496 --> 01:21:12,332
I am not crazy! You are crazy,
and I'm nothing like you!

846
01:21:14,002 --> 01:21:16,973
You really think you
can save the world?

847
01:21:22,544 --> 01:21:26,214
How about you try
saving yourself first?

848
01:21:26,314 --> 01:21:27,416
No! No!

849
01:21:35,991 --> 01:21:38,126
- Is that your gun?
- Yes.

850
01:21:39,526 --> 01:21:42,395
That's great. That's his prints now.

851
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:28,141
You can have some.

852
01:23:01,276 --> 01:23:03,309
Dinner's gonna be late.

853
01:23:15,757 --> 01:23:17,490
It won't take long.

854
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:28,704
Mommy has to go,
but she always comes back.

855
01:23:28,804 --> 01:23:32,908
If others need what I can spare,
I must with them my treasures share.

856
01:23:33,408 --> 01:23:34,443
Bye.

857
01:23:35,443 --> 01:23:38,845
- Be careful.
- I always am.

858
01:23:39,981 --> 01:23:41,948
Toodle-oo.

859
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:44,000
