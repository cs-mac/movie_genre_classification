1
00:00:12,862 --> 00:00:18,801
REMBRANDT

2
00:02:10,846 --> 00:02:12,780
Nobody in?

3
00:02:12,848 --> 00:02:15,783
- Shop!
- <i>Coming!</i>

4
00:02:17,853 --> 00:02:20,788
- Good morning, Master Rembrandt.
- Morning.

5
00:02:20,856 --> 00:02:22,790
Gentlemen, what can I
do for you?

6
00:02:22,858 --> 00:02:25,793
I'll have some colours, golden bronze,
yellow ochre, bull's blood.

7
00:02:25,861 --> 00:02:28,796
Don't be stubborn. You must paint
the officers of the Civic Guard.

8
00:02:28,864 --> 00:02:30,798
Think of what they'll pay!

9
00:02:30,866 --> 00:02:32,800
I don't like their faces.

10
00:02:32,868 --> 00:02:35,803
Now leave me alone. I'm busy
painting Saskia.

11
00:02:35,871 --> 00:02:39,807
Ultramarine, cobalt blue and
mixed vermilion.

12
00:02:40,876 --> 00:02:42,810
Rembrandt, how is Saskia?

13
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:44,812
Saskia is very well.

14
00:02:45,881 --> 00:02:48,816
- Where's your flemish green?
- <i>On your rigth.</i>

15
00:02:48,884 --> 00:02:51,819
She's in a very delicate state of
health, Rembrandt.

16
00:02:51,887 --> 00:02:54,754
Saskia's never been
better in her life.

17
00:02:55,824 --> 00:02:57,758
- What's this?
- <i>A new brew.</i>

18
00:02:57,826 --> 00:02:59,760
<i>A french painter invented it.</i>

19
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,764
I'll have some of this.

20
00:03:05,834 --> 00:03:07,768
Lovely flowers, master.

21
00:03:07,836 --> 00:03:10,771
Take them to my wife. You know my
house in the Jodenbreestraat?

22
00:03:10,839 --> 00:03:12,773
Yes, master. How many bunches?

23
00:03:12,841 --> 00:03:15,776
- Take the lot.
- I know. The whole barrow.

24
00:03:15,844 --> 00:03:18,779
My lucky day.

25
00:03:18,847 --> 00:03:21,782
- Etching needles?
- Try the english needles.

26
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:24,785
I think I will.
What about brushes?

27
00:03:24,853 --> 00:03:27,788
- Here.
- Master Rembrandt, look.

28
00:03:28,857 --> 00:03:31,792
- What have you got there?
- Perfect italian craftsmanship.

29
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,794
A real work of art.

30
00:03:33,862 --> 00:03:36,797
I've been looking for something
like this for a long time.

31
00:03:36,865 --> 00:03:39,800
I'll paint Saskia wearing this.

32
00:03:39,868 --> 00:03:40,800
I'll have it.

33
00:03:40,869 --> 00:03:43,804
5,000 florins, Master.

34
00:03:43,872 --> 00:03:46,807
My agent will see about that.

35
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:49,810
It's not worth more than 3,000
florins. It's madness, Rembrandt.

36
00:03:49,878 --> 00:03:52,848
You'd have to paint something
out-of-the-ordinary to pay for that.

37
00:03:52,848 --> 00:03:55,749
You'll have to paint the officers
of the Civic Guard.

38
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:58,753
All right, I'll paint the officers
of the Civic Guard.

39
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:07,762
The red fire of the rubies on
the whiteness of Saskia's neck.

40
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:10,765
The goddess Flora.

41
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,768
Saskia needs every
consideration.

42
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:16,771
Saskia has every consideration,
doctor.

43
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,774
She only gets up when I come
home to sit for the picture.

44
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:28,783
Titus, you must come now.

45
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:32,787
Your mother has to rest.

46
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:34,789
She has to sleep for
an hour.

47
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,791
Your father will be
here presently.

48
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:39,794
She has to put on a pretty
dress and fresh and well.

49
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:41,796
Your father's going to
paint her.

50
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,799
- Say good-bye.
- Good-bye.

51
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:47,802
Come along.

52
00:04:53,809 --> 00:04:56,744
- The master will be home in an hour.
- Which will it be?

53
00:04:56,812 --> 00:04:59,747
The brocade dress with
purple flowers...

54
00:04:59,815 --> 00:05:01,749
the gold shoes, the lace shawl,
gold hair ornament...

55
00:05:01,817 --> 00:05:03,751
and net and the
jewel box.

56
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,755
If the lady Saskia doesn't call in
an hour, go and waken her.

57
00:05:12,828 --> 00:05:14,762
You're a fool, Rembrandt.

58
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:18,765
Rembrandt.

59
00:05:29,845 --> 00:05:32,780
You promised our picture would be
next. Let's go and settle it.

60
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:37,785
Come on. You can paint Saskia
another day. Come on.

61
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:47,795
This is the new pupil. Show
him what to do.

62
00:05:52,835 --> 00:05:54,735
How much does your father
pay for your?

63
00:05:54,803 --> 00:05:56,737
25 florins a month.

64
00:05:56,805 --> 00:05:59,740
Yes. It's a lot of money.
We pay the same.

65
00:05:59,808 --> 00:06:01,742
If our fathers paid everything
they had, it wouldn't...

66
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,744
be enough for half an hour
of his teaching.

67
00:06:04,813 --> 00:06:06,747
He'll be here any
minute now.

68
00:06:06,815 --> 00:06:07,747
Run along!

69
00:06:07,816 --> 00:06:10,751
- How's Saskia?
- She's all right. She's sleeping.

70
00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:12,753
- When he comes in, will she get upset?
- Certainly she will.

71
00:06:12,821 --> 00:06:15,756
She's not to do it. He must be told.
He doesn't know ill she is.

72
00:06:15,824 --> 00:06:18,759
- We must get a doctor.
- I won't have a doctor in the house.

73
00:06:18,827 --> 00:06:20,761
- I won't have his life upset.
- Then I'll tell him.

74
00:06:20,829 --> 00:06:22,763
If you say a word...

75
00:06:25,834 --> 00:06:26,766
The lady Saskia.

76
00:06:27,836 --> 00:06:29,770
- Well, what is it?
- I don't know.

77
00:06:29,838 --> 00:06:31,772
- Should I get Dr. Tulp?
- Yes.

78
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,774
You better get Dr. Menasseh
as well.

79
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:46,787
Gentlemen, to the greatest painter
of our age, Rembrandt Van Rijn!

80
00:06:47,856 --> 00:06:49,790
He ought to pay us for
letting him paint...

81
00:06:49,858 --> 00:06:51,792
such a handsome lot
of fellows.

82
00:06:52,861 --> 00:06:55,796
Master Rembrandt is never in
need of models.

83
00:06:55,864 --> 00:06:59,800
Yes, He is. He can't paint his
wife all the time.

84
00:07:00,869 --> 00:07:04,805
How cold a man want to paint his
wife after 7 years of marriage?

85
00:07:09,878 --> 00:07:11,812
There was a man in the lanf
of Oars and the...

86
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,814
Lord gave him all that the
heart could desire.

87
00:07:13,882 --> 00:07:17,818
But beyond all this man was
in love with his wife.

88
00:07:17,886 --> 00:07:19,820
<i>He must have had a secret.</i>

89
00:07:19,888 --> 00:07:20,820
He had.

90
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:22,823
I'd like to know it.

91
00:07:23,892 --> 00:07:25,826
He had a vision once.

92
00:07:26,895 --> 00:07:29,830
A creature half child,
half woman.

93
00:07:29,898 --> 00:07:32,833
Half angel, half lover brushed
against him.

94
00:07:32,901 --> 00:07:34,835
All of a sudden he
knew that when...

95
00:07:34,903 --> 00:07:36,837
one woman gives
herself to you...

96
00:07:36,905 --> 00:07:39,840
you possess all women.

97
00:07:39,908 --> 00:07:43,844
Women of every age and
race and kind...

98
00:07:43,912 --> 00:07:46,847
and more than that, the
moon, the stars.

99
00:07:46,915 --> 00:07:49,850
All miracles and
legends are yours.

100
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:52,888
The brown-skinned girls
who enflame...

101
00:07:52,888 --> 00:07:55,789
your senses with
their play...

102
00:07:55,858 --> 00:08:00,795
the cool, yellow-haired women
who entice and escape you...

103
00:08:01,864 --> 00:08:03,798
the gentle ones
who se<i>rv</i>e you...

104
00:08:03,866 --> 00:08:06,801
slender ones torment you...

105
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,804
the mothers who bore
and suckled you...

106
00:08:09,872 --> 00:08:11,806
all women whom God
created out of...

107
00:08:11,874 --> 00:08:13,808
the teeming fullness
of the Earth...

108
00:08:13,876 --> 00:08:15,810
are yours in the love
of one woman.

109
00:08:15,878 --> 00:08:17,812
How?

110
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,815
Throw a purple garment
lightly over her shoulders.

111
00:08:20,883 --> 00:08:23,818
And she becomes the
queen of Sheba.

112
00:08:23,886 --> 00:08:27,822
Lay your tousled head blindly
upon her breast...

113
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:31,826
and she is a Delilah, waiting
to enthral you.

114
00:08:31,894 --> 00:08:37,833
Take her garments from her strip
the last veil from her body...

115
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,835
and she's a chaste Susanna...

116
00:08:40,903 --> 00:08:44,839
covering her nakedness with
fluttering hands.

117
00:08:44,907 --> 00:08:49,844
Gaze upon her as you would gaze
upon a thousand strange women...

118
00:08:49,912 --> 00:08:51,846
but never call her yours.

119
00:08:51,914 --> 00:08:55,782
For her secrets are inexhaustible,
you'll never know them all.

120
00:08:56,852 --> 00:08:59,787
Call her by one name only.

121
00:09:01,857 --> 00:09:03,791
I call her Saskia.

122
00:09:09,865 --> 00:09:11,799
Master Rembrandt,
come at once.

123
00:09:11,867 --> 00:09:13,801
Lady Saskia.

124
00:09:13,869 --> 00:09:15,803
Lady Saskia is...

125
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,809
The doctors should
be there by now.

126
00:09:21,877 --> 00:09:24,812
They ought to have been sent for
long ago, but I don't think...

127
00:09:27,883 --> 00:09:29,817
it's to late yet. There's nothing
to worry about. Really!

128
00:10:06,855 --> 00:10:08,789
Where is Rembrandt?

129
00:10:08,857 --> 00:10:10,791
Is he deliberately trying
to insult his guest?

130
00:10:10,859 --> 00:10:12,793
It is an insult.

131
00:10:12,861 --> 00:10:14,795
Have you ever heard of
a man who refused...

132
00:10:14,863 --> 00:10:16,797
to be present at his own
wife's funeral feast?

133
00:10:16,865 --> 00:10:18,799
- Where is him?
- Do you suppose he's in his studio?

134
00:10:18,867 --> 00:10:21,802
Is this a proper time for him
to be working...

135
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:24,805
with the funeral chimes still
ringing in his ears?

136
00:10:34,883 --> 00:10:36,817
The equerry to the
Prince of Orange.

137
00:10:36,885 --> 00:10:38,819
I'm going to fetch him.

138
00:11:04,846 --> 00:11:06,780
You see, she's wearing
a new necklace.

139
00:11:09,851 --> 00:11:12,786
I can still see her.
Soon it will fade.

140
00:11:12,854 --> 00:11:15,789
It will be as lost to me as
her body is lost to the grave.

141
00:11:15,857 --> 00:11:17,791
I haven't got much time.

142
00:11:32,874 --> 00:11:36,810
I have the honor, sir, in the name
of his highness, the Prince...

143
00:11:36,878 --> 00:11:38,812
to convey to you the deepest
sympathy of the...

144
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,814
house of Orange in your
sad bereavement.

145
00:11:44,886 --> 00:11:46,820
Did you say something to me?

146
00:11:49,891 --> 00:11:53,759
I have the honor, sir, in the name
of his highness, the Prince...

147
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:55,763
to convey to you the deepest
sympathy of the...

148
00:11:55,831 --> 00:11:57,765
house of Orange in your
sad bereavement.

149
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:59,767
Thank you.

150
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:40,807
Finished.

151
00:12:45,881 --> 00:12:47,815
Yes, it's a great moment.

152
00:12:47,883 --> 00:12:49,817
No greater and no
less than when...

153
00:12:49,885 --> 00:12:51,819
a shoemaker finishes
a pair of shoes.

154
00:12:56,825 --> 00:12:58,759
- Yes, it's a great picture.
- Yes.

155
00:12:58,827 --> 00:13:02,763
The greatest, the longest, the
largest, and the darkest.

156
00:13:02,831 --> 00:13:06,767
- They'll jump out of their boots.
- They'll go down on their knees.

157
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:13,774
Run along now. Guest will be
here presently.

158
00:13:20,849 --> 00:13:23,784
My lord burgomaster, ladies
and gentlemen...

159
00:13:23,852 --> 00:13:26,787
this is a memorable day in the
history of the Civic Guard.

160
00:13:26,855 --> 00:13:30,791
In the name of their lordships,
I request you to unveil...

161
00:13:30,859 --> 00:13:33,794
Rembrandt Van
Rijn's masterpiece.

162
00:14:45,867 --> 00:14:47,801
That helmet might be mine.

163
00:14:47,869 --> 00:14:49,803
No, it must be those legs.

164
00:14:49,871 --> 00:14:52,841
<i>A fine fair of legs for</i>
<i>all that money?</i>

165
00:14:52,841 --> 00:14:54,741
He's given banning Cocq
a clubbed foot.

166
00:14:54,809 --> 00:14:57,744
- Rombout kemp a hunchback.
- Where?

167
00:14:57,812 --> 00:15:00,747
Is that supposed to be
me, that grinning ape?

168
00:15:01,816 --> 00:15:03,750
What do you think of
the picture.

169
00:15:04,819 --> 00:15:06,753
No evasion. What do
you think of it?

170
00:15:06,821 --> 00:15:08,755
I can't say. I don't
understand it.

171
00:15:08,823 --> 00:15:11,758
- I can't see anything in it.
- You can't see anything?

172
00:15:11,826 --> 00:15:14,761
I can't see nothing but shadows,
darkness, and confusion.

173
00:15:14,829 --> 00:15:18,765
You surely don't expect us to
take this as serious art.

174
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:22,769
Something's got to be done.
They're making fun of it.

175
00:15:22,837 --> 00:15:25,772
Can't you hear them? It's no good
twiddling your moustache.

176
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,775
They say they won't pay. They say
you must paint a fresh picture.

177
00:15:28,843 --> 00:15:32,779
What did you think you were
doing? It's beyond a joke.

178
00:15:34,849 --> 00:15:36,783
- I agree with you, it is.
- Go on, say something to them.

179
00:15:39,854 --> 00:15:41,788
You're not suggesting that
I should apologize?

180
00:15:41,856 --> 00:15:44,791
I'm asking you to save
the situation.

181
00:15:44,859 --> 00:15:46,793
Think of what's at stake.

182
00:15:47,862 --> 00:15:49,796
Save the situation?

183
00:15:51,866 --> 00:15:53,731
All rigth.

184
00:15:57,806 --> 00:15:59,740
Capitain Banning Cocq.

185
00:16:03,812 --> 00:16:05,746
You have something
to say me?

186
00:16:07,816 --> 00:16:10,751
You undertook to paint the
portraits of 16...

187
00:16:10,819 --> 00:16:13,754
of my officers at 200 florins
a head.

188
00:16:13,822 --> 00:16:16,757
Of 16, only 6 are recognisable.

189
00:16:16,825 --> 00:16:18,759
Surely, you can't expect
the remaining...

190
00:16:18,827 --> 00:16:20,761
10 to pay for portraits
that don't exist.

191
00:16:20,829 --> 00:16:23,764
10 of these gentlemen have
nothing to pay.

192
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:25,765
Is there anything else?

193
00:16:27,836 --> 00:16:29,770
Yes, there is something else.

194
00:16:29,838 --> 00:16:31,772
You undertook to paint a
good satisfactory...

195
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,774
picture of our mess room.

196
00:16:33,842 --> 00:16:36,777
But this thing is
a monstrosity.

197
00:16:36,845 --> 00:16:38,779
Look at it for yourself.

198
00:16:38,847 --> 00:16:40,781
Is that supposed to represent...

199
00:16:40,849 --> 00:16:42,783
the officers of the
noble Civic Guard...

200
00:16:42,851 --> 00:16:44,785
a collection of gentlemen?

201
00:16:44,853 --> 00:16:47,788
Do those look like gentlemen
of rank and position?

202
00:16:47,856 --> 00:16:50,791
I wasn't trying to paint
gentlemen...

203
00:16:50,859 --> 00:16:53,794
of rank and position.
I wanted to paint men.

204
00:16:53,862 --> 00:16:55,796
Soldiers.

205
00:16:55,864 --> 00:16:57,798
A company marching out.

206
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:04,805
Gentlemen of rank and
position, indeed.

207
00:17:07,876 --> 00:17:10,811
Here's your gentlemen of rank
and what's underneath it.

208
00:17:10,879 --> 00:17:13,814
And this, and this,
and this!

209
00:17:13,882 --> 00:17:17,818
Your nose is painted by
bad liquor.

210
00:17:17,886 --> 00:17:21,822
Your mouth is reeking with
bawdy kisses.

211
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:25,826
Vanity and stupidity are
written all over your face.

212
00:17:25,894 --> 00:17:28,829
The only pretty thing
about you are...

213
00:17:28,897 --> 00:17:30,831
your ruffs and breastplates!

214
00:17:30,899 --> 00:17:33,834
And the only distinguished thing
about you are your hats!

215
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:46,847
- How many people are coming?
- How many? You'll see them.

216
00:17:46,915 --> 00:17:49,850
I'll teach you to answer me like
that when I speak to you.

217
00:17:49,918 --> 00:17:51,852
When the master comes, you'll
be sent packing.

218
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,785
- I am packing.
- You just wait.

219
00:17:53,855 --> 00:17:55,789
I've waited long enough.

220
00:17:55,857 --> 00:17:59,793
25 florins a month to a master who
is the laughingstock of the town.

221
00:17:59,861 --> 00:18:01,795
- That's a lie.
- I'm leaving him.

222
00:18:01,863 --> 00:18:03,797
You can wait and hear what
I've got to say to him.

223
00:18:06,868 --> 00:18:07,800
Where are the guests?

224
00:18:07,869 --> 00:18:10,804
Aren't we guests enough for
your fine dinner?

225
00:18:10,872 --> 00:18:13,807
- You've got something to say to me?
- No, sir.

226
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,809
Wasn't it something about
25 florins is too much...

227
00:18:15,877 --> 00:18:18,812
who's been derided by
the whole town?

228
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,814
No, sir.

229
00:18:21,883 --> 00:18:23,817
I ought to know something
about faces.

230
00:18:24,886 --> 00:18:27,821
- But, I might be mistaken.
- Yes, sir.

231
00:18:27,889 --> 00:18:29,823
But you're going to
leave me...

232
00:18:29,891 --> 00:18:32,826
you'll go to a better master.
You'll be rich and successful.

233
00:18:34,896 --> 00:18:36,830
I want dinner.

234
00:18:43,905 --> 00:18:45,839
Get out, all of you.

235
00:18:54,849 --> 00:18:56,783
Not very cheerful tonight.

236
00:18:58,853 --> 00:19:00,787
This will put new life
into you.

237
00:19:06,861 --> 00:19:07,793
Good health!

238
00:19:14,869 --> 00:19:18,805
Dutchman's mother's milk, the
staff of life in a stone bottle.

239
00:19:18,873 --> 00:19:20,807
Now I'll show you how we
drink you how...

240
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,809
we drink it in Leyden, where
I come from.

241
00:19:34,889 --> 00:19:35,821
Come on!

242
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:39,826
Get your glass
and come on.

243
00:19:43,898 --> 00:19:45,832
Look at him.

244
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,834
Flinck!

245
00:19:47,902 --> 00:19:50,837
Get up, you drunken swine.

246
00:19:54,842 --> 00:19:56,776
You're a good lad, Fabrizius.

247
00:20:00,848 --> 00:20:03,783
You're good, too, Dirxie.

248
00:20:09,857 --> 00:20:13,793
You're a good lad. And you leave
me for a better master.

249
00:20:13,861 --> 00:20:16,796
I'll never leave
you, master.

250
00:20:16,864 --> 00:20:18,798
For a better master,
I said.

251
00:20:19,867 --> 00:20:21,801
But, you're the greatest.

252
00:20:28,876 --> 00:20:31,811
Every man has a
destined path.

253
00:20:31,879 --> 00:20:34,814
If it leads him into the
wilderness, he's got to...

254
00:20:34,882 --> 00:20:37,817
follow it with his head high
and a smile on his lips.

255
00:20:37,885 --> 00:20:40,820
But you are following the
right path, master.

256
00:20:40,888 --> 00:20:42,822
You've known success.

257
00:20:43,891 --> 00:20:45,825
What is success?

258
00:20:47,895 --> 00:20:51,831
A soldier can reckon his
success in victories...

259
00:20:51,899 --> 00:20:53,764
the merchant in money.

260
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:56,770
But my world is
insubstantial.

261
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:06,780
I live in a beautiful, blinding,
swirling mist.

262
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,784
The world can offer
me nothing.

263
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:13,787
What I need is a woman
I can call my wife.

264
00:24:19,841 --> 00:24:22,776
No good. Most of them are his own
work, they won't fetch anything.

265
00:24:22,844 --> 00:24:24,778
Here's a Rubens sketch.

266
00:24:24,846 --> 00:24:26,780
A bit of antique sculpture.

267
00:24:26,848 --> 00:24:29,783
Those glasses and beakers
they're genuine.

268
00:24:29,851 --> 00:24:32,786
And now the jewels. The
jewels. The casket.

269
00:24:32,854 --> 00:24:34,788
The jewels.
The casket.

270
00:24:35,857 --> 00:24:37,791
Very well.

271
00:24:40,862 --> 00:24:41,794
Come on.

272
00:24:41,863 --> 00:24:43,797
Lot of vultures!

273
00:24:43,865 --> 00:24:46,800
Here's some daylight for you so
you can see what you're getting.

274
00:24:49,871 --> 00:24:53,739
You take everything anybody's
got left in the world.

275
00:24:53,808 --> 00:24:55,742
The jewels!
The casket!

276
00:24:56,811 --> 00:24:57,743
There it is.

277
00:25:06,821 --> 00:25:08,755
- Where are the jewels?
- We've eaten them.

278
00:25:08,823 --> 00:25:10,757
How do suppose we've
managed to live?

279
00:25:12,827 --> 00:25:14,761
What are you doing here?

280
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:17,764
- Get out!
- Keep calm, young gentleman.

281
00:25:17,832 --> 00:25:20,767
They're here on business.
You wouldn't understand.

282
00:25:20,835 --> 00:25:22,769
No! I want to know
what's going on.

283
00:25:22,837 --> 00:25:24,771
Show him the distraint order.

284
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,775
The distraint order of the
court of Bankruptcy.

285
00:25:31,846 --> 00:25:34,781
- You see, your father owes money.
- He'll pay it.

286
00:25:34,849 --> 00:25:37,784
It's a great deal of money. He
owes it to the tax collector...

287
00:25:37,852 --> 00:25:39,786
the green grocer,
to everybody.

288
00:25:39,854 --> 00:25:41,788
They all come to me
because I'm his agent.

289
00:25:41,856 --> 00:25:43,790
I've lost thousands
over him myself.

290
00:25:43,858 --> 00:25:45,792
We've got to get our
money somehow.

291
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,794
Is there no other way?

292
00:25:47,862 --> 00:25:50,797
Must you take away his house,
everything he has?

293
00:25:50,865 --> 00:25:53,732
He might to go the Prince to
solicit a commission or a grant.

294
00:25:53,801 --> 00:25:57,737
If he asks for a commission, he'll
have to learn to paint properly.

295
00:25:57,805 --> 00:25:59,739
My father paints as
he pleases.

296
00:25:59,807 --> 00:26:01,741
Listen, child, you go
to your room.

297
00:26:01,809 --> 00:26:03,743
Don't waste your time
painting and drawing.

298
00:26:03,811 --> 00:26:05,745
Look what it brings
you to.

299
00:26:05,813 --> 00:26:07,747
Come on, get on with
your studies.

300
00:26:09,817 --> 00:26:14,754
<i>Don't walk so fast,</i>
<i>my gentle sirs</i>

301
00:26:14,822 --> 00:26:17,757
<i>For time, you cannot</i>
<i>leave behind</i>

302
00:26:18,826 --> 00:26:21,761
<i>Once your mortal souls</i>
<i>are shriven</i>

303
00:26:21,829 --> 00:26:25,765
<i>You'll find eternity</i>
<i>in heaven</i>

304
00:26:25,833 --> 00:26:29,769
<i>Therefore, don't stay,</i>
<i>but give today</i>

305
00:26:30,838 --> 00:26:34,774
<i>To him that gives is given</i>

306
00:26:34,842 --> 00:26:37,777
Your business doesn't seem
to prosper today.

307
00:26:37,845 --> 00:26:38,777
It's no worse than yours.

308
00:26:38,846 --> 00:26:40,780
What do you know about me
and my business?

309
00:26:40,848 --> 00:26:43,783
Everyone knows you're the man
who paints beggars.

310
00:26:43,851 --> 00:26:45,785
Some say you're no better than
a beggar yourself.

311
00:26:45,853 --> 00:26:48,788
I like the look of you. You've got
the head of a tragic prophet.

312
00:26:48,856 --> 00:26:49,788
I don't like the look of you.

313
00:26:49,857 --> 00:26:52,792
You talk like a fine gentleman, but
you're nothing bit a bad painter.

314
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,795
You old scoundrel. What
do you mean?

315
00:26:55,863 --> 00:26:57,797
If you were a good
painter, there would...

316
00:26:57,865 --> 00:26:59,799
be no need for you to
paint beggars.

317
00:26:59,867 --> 00:27:02,802
Decent painters paint
decent people...

318
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:04,804
gentlemen of rank...

319
00:27:04,872 --> 00:27:06,806
fine ladies, kings.

320
00:27:07,875 --> 00:27:09,809
I do paint kings.

321
00:27:09,877 --> 00:27:12,812
I'll make an old testament
king out of you.

322
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,814
- How much?
- How much do you want?

323
00:27:14,882 --> 00:27:17,817
If you were a decent painter,
I'd ask half a florin.

324
00:27:17,885 --> 00:27:19,819
I'm losing business
all the time.

325
00:27:19,887 --> 00:27:21,821
It's a bargain. You shall
have your half florin.

326
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:23,822
Thanks.

327
00:27:24,892 --> 00:27:26,826
I haven't got any money
with me.

328
00:27:26,894 --> 00:27:29,829
What did I say? You're not
a decent painter.

329
00:27:29,897 --> 00:27:33,833
<i>Don't walk so fast,</i>
<i>my gentle sirs</i>

330
00:27:34,902 --> 00:27:36,836
All right. All right.

331
00:27:36,904 --> 00:27:38,838
I want to paint that royal
scoundrely face of yours.

332
00:27:38,906 --> 00:27:40,840
Now you stop here and
don't move.

333
00:27:40,908 --> 00:27:42,842
I'll come back with your
blood money.

334
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:45,845
Don't walk so fast,
my gentle sir.

335
00:27:45,913 --> 00:27:47,847
<i>For time you cannot</i>
<i>leave behind...</i>

336
00:27:47,915 --> 00:27:49,849
Thank you kindly, madam.

337
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,786
I came out without any money.
I need half a florin.

338
00:27:54,855 --> 00:27:56,789
Half of a florin in cash?

339
00:27:56,857 --> 00:27:58,791
It isn't much good in
sugar or clothes.

340
00:27:58,859 --> 00:28:01,794
That reminds me, you owe me
a rather large bill...

341
00:28:01,862 --> 00:28:03,796
for sugar and clothes.

342
00:28:03,864 --> 00:28:05,798
Afraid you're not getting
your money back?

343
00:28:05,866 --> 00:28:06,798
I didn't say so, Rembrandt.

344
00:28:06,867 --> 00:28:08,801
Will you lend it to me or not?

345
00:28:08,869 --> 00:28:11,804
Well, you were a good
customer once.

346
00:28:11,872 --> 00:28:14,807
I should say, I was. Put it on the
bill and send in your account.

347
00:28:14,875 --> 00:28:15,807
Good day.

348
00:28:20,881 --> 00:28:21,813
Good day.

349
00:28:22,883 --> 00:28:25,818
Debit half a florin to charities.

350
00:28:27,888 --> 00:28:29,822
The young Prince arrives at
Amsterdam today...

351
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:31,824
with his English bride,
the Stuart Princess.

352
00:28:31,892 --> 00:28:33,826
There will be a big reception
at the town hall.

353
00:28:33,894 --> 00:28:35,828
What should he do?

354
00:28:35,896 --> 00:28:37,830
Get his name on the
list of petitioners.

355
00:28:37,898 --> 00:28:40,833
He should remind the Prince his
father was his patron...

356
00:28:40,901 --> 00:28:42,835
and ask for a commission
or a grant.

357
00:28:42,903 --> 00:28:45,838
All right. He shall go
to the Prince.

358
00:28:45,906 --> 00:28:48,841
- And paint properly.
- And paint properly.

359
00:28:48,909 --> 00:28:51,844
He shall paint properly.

360
00:28:58,853 --> 00:29:00,787
- Where is she?
- The front door.

361
00:29:00,855 --> 00:29:02,789
- That's fine. She won't hear us.
- There were some men here.

362
00:29:02,857 --> 00:29:04,791
Titus, isn't he King Saul
to the life?

363
00:29:04,859 --> 00:29:07,794
- But Ludwick, and the lawyer...
- Come on.

364
00:29:16,871 --> 00:29:17,803
All right.

365
00:29:19,874 --> 00:29:21,808
Now, you old scarecrow, put
down your stick...

366
00:29:21,876 --> 00:29:23,810
take off those rags, and get
up on the throne.

367
00:29:24,879 --> 00:29:26,813
- Up where?
- Up there.

368
00:29:28,883 --> 00:29:30,817
Careful.

369
00:29:30,885 --> 00:29:32,819
Titus, the gold brocade and
the purple cloak.

370
00:29:41,896 --> 00:29:43,830
Put this ring on your finger.

371
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,834
You needn't try and pocket that.
It's only imitation.

372
00:30:09,857 --> 00:30:11,791
So the young gentleman's going
to play to me, is he?

373
00:30:11,859 --> 00:30:13,793
Is that the best you can
do for me?

374
00:30:13,861 --> 00:30:15,795
I thought I was supposed
to be a king.

375
00:30:16,864 --> 00:30:19,799
A real king ought to have dozens
of beautiful females...

376
00:30:19,867 --> 00:30:21,801
lying around on cushions...

377
00:30:21,869 --> 00:30:23,803
and offering him drinks.

378
00:30:25,873 --> 00:30:29,809
You're an old king and you've
had all the women you want.

379
00:30:30,878 --> 00:30:33,813
What's more, the evil spirit has
entered into you.

380
00:30:33,881 --> 00:30:35,815
Has it? What's that?

381
00:30:38,886 --> 00:30:40,820
Have you never heard the
story of King Saul?

382
00:30:41,889 --> 00:30:42,821
King S...

383
00:30:43,891 --> 00:30:45,825
I've never heard of
King Saul.

384
00:30:46,894 --> 00:30:48,828
Saul was a great King.

385
00:30:50,898 --> 00:30:52,832
And a great hero of
his people.

386
00:30:53,834 --> 00:30:57,770
Mighty and strong, the wind of
heaven filled his breast...

387
00:30:57,838 --> 00:31:00,773
and the hair grew on his head
like a lion's name.

388
00:31:01,842 --> 00:31:04,777
But the spirit of the Lord was
not upon him.

389
00:31:04,845 --> 00:31:08,781
And he that hath not the spirit of
the lord within him...

390
00:31:08,849 --> 00:31:11,784
all the power of the world and
the riches of the earth...

391
00:31:11,852 --> 00:31:13,786
shall not avail for his heart
will be troubled.

392
00:31:13,854 --> 00:31:15,788
Now, at this time...

393
00:31:16,857 --> 00:31:20,793
the boy David was tending
his father's sheep.

394
00:31:20,861 --> 00:31:24,797
He was a comely youth ruddy, and
of beautiful countenance...

395
00:31:24,865 --> 00:31:27,800
but he was poor and
despised of men.

396
00:31:27,868 --> 00:31:30,803
And the Lord spoke: "It matters
not what a man sees.

397
00:31:30,871 --> 00:31:33,806
For a man sees only what is
before his eyes.

398
00:31:33,874 --> 00:31:36,809
But God sees into
the heart."

399
00:31:37,878 --> 00:31:41,814
And the king was troubled by an
evil spirit so that he cried...

400
00:31:41,882 --> 00:31:45,818
out in the night and so could not
sleep with his heart hardened.

401
00:31:45,886 --> 00:31:49,822
Then his friends brought the boy
David to him for he was a...

402
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:53,758
cunning player on the harp and
a good voice sang out of him.

403
00:31:53,827 --> 00:31:56,762
And he played that night
before the king...

404
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:59,765
until the evil spirit
departed from him.

405
00:32:00,834 --> 00:32:02,768
And peace entered
his soul.

406
00:32:03,837 --> 00:32:07,773
So he played and sang, the
future king of Israel...

407
00:32:07,841 --> 00:32:10,776
before the king who was
to make way for him...

408
00:32:11,845 --> 00:32:15,781
the rising star before the
waning star...

409
00:32:15,849 --> 00:32:18,784
the bright light before
the fading one...

410
00:32:18,852 --> 00:32:20,786
God's chosen...

411
00:32:20,854 --> 00:32:24,790
before him whom God
had forsaken.

412
00:32:25,859 --> 00:32:27,793
And he sang this song...

413
00:32:28,862 --> 00:32:32,798
"The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.

414
00:32:32,866 --> 00:32:36,802
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

415
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:40,806
He leadeth me beside
the still waters.

416
00:32:40,874 --> 00:32:42,808
He restoreth my soul.

417
00:32:42,876 --> 00:32:46,812
He guideth me in the paths
of righteousness.

418
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,816
Though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death.

419
00:32:50,884 --> 00:32:52,853
I will fear no evil...

420
00:32:52,853 --> 00:32:54,753
for thou art with me.

421
00:32:54,822 --> 00:32:58,758
Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me."

422
00:33:15,843 --> 00:33:17,777
<i>Open the door!</i>

423
00:33:18,846 --> 00:33:20,780
<i>I know you're in there!</i>
<i>I have something to tell you.</i>

424
00:33:20,848 --> 00:33:23,783
<i>That's more important</i>
<i>than your work.</i>

425
00:33:24,852 --> 00:33:26,786
<i>You'll see a different you</i>
<i>when you find...</i>

426
00:33:26,854 --> 00:33:28,788
<i>yourselves without a roof</i>
<i>over your heads!</i>

427
00:33:28,856 --> 00:33:30,790
Stop that noise!

428
00:33:30,858 --> 00:33:32,792
<i>He still thinks he's</i>
<i>the Master...</i>

429
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,794
<i>a Master driven out of his own</i>
<i>house like a beggar...</i>

430
00:33:34,862 --> 00:33:36,796
<i>a worthless beggar!</i>

431
00:33:36,864 --> 00:33:39,799
They don't think much of our
profession here.

432
00:33:39,867 --> 00:33:41,801
Stay where you are.
We're working.

433
00:33:41,869 --> 00:33:42,801
<i>Open this door!</i>

434
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:45,805
<i>Titus, tell your father to</i>
<i>open the door!</i>

435
00:33:45,873 --> 00:33:47,807
Father, please don't be angry...

436
00:33:47,875 --> 00:33:49,809
but it would be better if you
opened the door.

437
00:33:50,878 --> 00:33:52,812
<i>Open the door!</i>

438
00:33:55,816 --> 00:33:57,750
Open the door!

439
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:03,756
The bailiff's men have been here.
They're going to seize the house.

440
00:34:03,824 --> 00:34:05,758
We'll be flung out on the street
without a moment's notice.

441
00:34:05,826 --> 00:34:07,760
You won't have a thing left
to call your...

442
00:34:07,828 --> 00:34:09,762
own not even the bed
you sleep in.

443
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:12,765
- I don't care!
- You don't care.

444
00:34:12,833 --> 00:34:14,767
You stand there seeing
ruin staring you...

445
00:34:14,835 --> 00:34:16,769
in the face and you
don't raise a finger.

446
00:34:17,838 --> 00:34:19,772
Look at you.

447
00:34:20,841 --> 00:34:22,775
So untidy.

448
00:34:23,844 --> 00:34:26,779
Your beard all over
your face.

449
00:34:28,849 --> 00:34:31,784
Listen, you've got to go to the
Prince. It's your last chance.

450
00:34:31,852 --> 00:34:33,786
Tell him how much his father
thought of you.

451
00:34:33,854 --> 00:34:37,790
Say that through no fault of your
own you've fallen upon evil times.

452
00:34:37,858 --> 00:34:40,793
Make him give you some
commissions or a grant of money.

453
00:34:40,861 --> 00:34:43,796
Use your common sense.

454
00:34:46,867 --> 00:34:48,801
Attend to your business.
Paint the sort...

455
00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:50,803
of pictures people
want nowadays.

456
00:34:50,871 --> 00:34:51,803
Look at Flinck...

457
00:34:51,872 --> 00:34:53,737
one of your worst pupils.

458
00:34:53,807 --> 00:34:56,742
Now he owns a carriage
repair. Why?

459
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:58,744
Because he paints
high-class pictures...

460
00:34:58,812 --> 00:35:00,746
and gives the people
what they want.

461
00:35:00,814 --> 00:35:02,748
You'd better do the
same, otherwise...

462
00:35:02,816 --> 00:35:04,750
you'll be ruined and
us along with you.

463
00:35:04,818 --> 00:35:07,753
I've worked and slaved and given
my life to this house and the boy...

464
00:35:07,821 --> 00:35:10,756
for a man who repays it with
nothing but ingratitude!

465
00:35:10,824 --> 00:35:12,758
The best years of my life have
gone to work and worry!

466
00:35:12,826 --> 00:35:15,761
Now I'm to be turned into the
streets to sta<i>rv</i>e!

467
00:35:15,829 --> 00:35:17,763
He won't raise a finger
to save those...

468
00:35:17,831 --> 00:35:19,765
he's brought to ruin
and disgrace!

469
00:35:19,833 --> 00:35:21,767
All right, I'll go to
the Prince.

470
00:35:23,837 --> 00:35:24,769
You will?

471
00:35:28,842 --> 00:35:31,777
I'm going to brush you before
you go to see anybody.

472
00:35:32,846 --> 00:35:34,780
We shan't be working
anymore today.

473
00:35:35,849 --> 00:35:37,783
And I was just feeling in
the right mood.

474
00:35:37,851 --> 00:35:40,786
I might not feel like it
another day.

475
00:35:52,833 --> 00:35:54,733
You're not really going,
are you?

476
00:35:56,803 --> 00:35:59,738
Listen, Titus...
if anything happens to me...

477
00:35:59,806 --> 00:36:01,740
you go to the country to your
mother's people.

478
00:36:01,808 --> 00:36:03,742
You'll live a fine life.

479
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:07,746
- No! I mean to be a painter like you.
- Don't you wish for that.

480
00:36:08,815 --> 00:36:10,749
Don't you want to be a painter.

481
00:36:16,823 --> 00:36:18,757
What are you doing here?

482
00:36:18,825 --> 00:36:20,759
Here, take this.

483
00:36:20,827 --> 00:36:22,761
It's only imitation.

484
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:33,772
Where are you going?

485
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,774
I'm going begging.
Why don't you come...

486
00:36:35,842 --> 00:36:37,776
along with me?
You may profit by it.

487
00:36:38,845 --> 00:36:41,780
Are you going begging to
the town hall, too?

488
00:36:41,848 --> 00:36:43,782
No, to the town gates first.

489
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:45,784
Why don't you come
and watch me?

490
00:36:45,852 --> 00:36:49,788
I can teach you more about the art
of begging than any in Holland.

491
00:36:49,856 --> 00:36:51,790
I still owe you some of
that half florin.

492
00:36:51,858 --> 00:36:53,792
You can take it out in lessons
from me if you like.

493
00:37:20,887 --> 00:37:24,823
Now watch me and see
how it's done.

494
00:37:25,892 --> 00:37:27,826
Look miserable. Come now,
not too miserable.

495
00:37:27,894 --> 00:37:29,828
If you look a hopeless case they'll
think you're past helping.

496
00:37:32,899 --> 00:37:36,835
When your right eye waters let
your left eye twinkle.

497
00:37:36,903 --> 00:37:40,839
Then when you show your
rags cut a caper.

498
00:37:40,907 --> 00:37:42,841
So as they say:
"Look at that fellow.

499
00:37:42,909 --> 00:37:44,843
He may be sta<i>rv</i>ing, but he's
got a merry air."

500
00:37:44,911 --> 00:37:46,845
Then they'll give you some.

501
00:37:50,917 --> 00:37:51,849
There they are!

502
00:38:55,849 --> 00:38:56,781
Here.

503
00:38:57,851 --> 00:38:58,783
Thank you, sir.

504
00:38:58,852 --> 00:39:00,786
You'll never be any
good. A born beggar...

505
00:39:00,854 --> 00:39:02,788
takes what he finds
and keeps it.

506
00:39:02,856 --> 00:39:04,790
You needn't be proud
of your old tricks.

507
00:39:04,858 --> 00:39:07,793
Any child can learn to catch
pennies if it's hungry.

508
00:39:08,862 --> 00:39:11,797
Do you know how an artist has
to beg at Court?

509
00:39:12,866 --> 00:39:16,802
An artist has to smile and
smile and keep on smiling.

510
00:39:17,871 --> 00:39:19,805
"May I humbly crave the
honour of being...

511
00:39:19,873 --> 00:39:22,808
presented to his royal
Highness?"

512
00:39:22,876 --> 00:39:26,812
"I am a painter...
Rembrandt Van Rijn."

513
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,814
"Yes, I remember you now.

514
00:39:28,882 --> 00:39:31,817
Wasn't there some scandal
about a picture...

515
00:39:31,885 --> 00:39:33,819
you painted for
the Civic Guard?"

516
00:39:33,887 --> 00:39:36,822
I hope you've learned how
to behave properly!

517
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:41,827
I can't behave properly!
I can't paint properly.

518
00:39:43,897 --> 00:39:45,831
But I can live my
life properly.

519
00:39:45,899 --> 00:39:48,834
Without money?
Where?

520
00:39:49,903 --> 00:39:51,837
At home.

521
00:39:52,873 --> 00:39:56,775
At my father's house. It's a
mill near Leyden.

522
00:39:56,843 --> 00:39:58,777
A mill, among peasants?

523
00:40:01,848 --> 00:40:03,782
I was born a peasant.

524
00:40:54,835 --> 00:40:56,769
Hello, father.

525
00:40:56,837 --> 00:40:59,772
Adriaen, here's your brother.
He's come home.

526
00:41:00,841 --> 00:41:02,775
Good evening, Adriaen.

527
00:41:03,844 --> 00:41:05,778
It's a long time since you've
been here.

528
00:41:06,847 --> 00:41:09,782
Well, I've had so much
work to do.

529
00:41:11,852 --> 00:41:13,786
I've new portraits and
commissions.

530
00:41:13,854 --> 00:41:15,788
That's good. The mill's
flourishing, too.

531
00:41:15,856 --> 00:41:17,790
We're kept busy morning
till night.

532
00:41:17,858 --> 00:41:19,792
I'm glad to hear that,
father.

533
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:22,795
You're just in time
for supper.

534
00:41:28,869 --> 00:41:31,804
You shall read the lesson
tonight, son.

535
00:41:32,873 --> 00:41:33,805
There.

536
00:41:41,882 --> 00:41:45,818
"I considered the days of old,
the ancient times.

537
00:41:47,888 --> 00:41:50,823
Will the lord cast
off forever?

538
00:41:51,892 --> 00:41:54,759
Will he be favourable
no more?

539
00:41:54,828 --> 00:41:58,764
Hath his mercy clean
gone forever?

540
00:41:58,832 --> 00:42:02,768
Doth his promise fail
for evermore?

541
00:42:03,837 --> 00:42:06,772
Hath God forgotten
to be gracious?

542
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,774
Hath he in anger
shut up...

543
00:42:09,843 --> 00:42:13,779
his tender mercies?

544
00:42:13,847 --> 00:42:16,782
And I said: This is my infirmity,
but I will remember...

545
00:42:17,851 --> 00:42:21,787
the years of the right hand
of the most High.

546
00:42:22,856 --> 00:42:25,791
I will remember the works
of the Lord.

547
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:29,795
Surely I will remember thy
wonders of old.

548
00:42:32,866 --> 00:42:34,800
The waters saw
thee, o God...

549
00:42:34,868 --> 00:42:36,802
the water saw thee.
They were afraid.

550
00:42:37,871 --> 00:42:39,805
The depths also were
troubled.

551
00:42:40,874 --> 00:42:42,808
The clouds poured
out water.

552
00:42:42,876 --> 00:42:44,810
The skies sent out a sound.

553
00:42:44,878 --> 00:42:47,813
Thine arrows also
went abroad.

554
00:42:48,882 --> 00:42:50,816
The voice of thy thunder
was in heaven.

555
00:42:50,884 --> 00:42:52,852
The lightnings lightened
the earth.

556
00:42:52,852 --> 00:42:55,753
And the earth trembled
and shook.

557
00:42:58,825 --> 00:43:01,760
But I will meditate also
of all thy works...

558
00:43:01,828 --> 00:43:03,762
and talk of thy doings.

559
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:08,767
Thy way, o God is
in the sanctuary."

560
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:35,794
It's a poor meal.

561
00:43:35,862 --> 00:43:38,797
Bread and soup.
Country fare.

562
00:43:39,866 --> 00:43:40,798
Black bread.

563
00:43:41,868 --> 00:43:43,802
Peasant's bread.

564
00:43:44,871 --> 00:43:46,805
I'm home.

565
00:44:45,865 --> 00:44:48,800
- Not so fast, little one.
- Let me go.

566
00:44:49,869 --> 00:44:51,803
Am I mistaken...

567
00:44:51,871 --> 00:44:54,738
or do I recognise that pretty
nose of yours?

568
00:44:54,808 --> 00:44:56,742
I've never seen your fat nose
before in all my life.

569
00:44:56,810 --> 00:44:59,745
- A kiss if I guess right?
- Yes, you can have a kiss.

570
00:44:59,813 --> 00:45:03,749
But if you're wrong, you buy
me a pot of beer.

571
00:45:03,817 --> 00:45:05,751
Sutja, right?

572
00:45:05,819 --> 00:45:07,753
That's my sister.

573
00:45:07,821 --> 00:45:09,755
You're little Elsa?

574
00:45:10,824 --> 00:45:12,758
Well, children grow up.

575
00:45:13,827 --> 00:45:16,762
Aw, you're not a stranger.
You do belong here.

576
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:17,762
I do.

577
00:45:17,831 --> 00:45:19,765
It's my home.

578
00:45:19,833 --> 00:45:22,768
You know, you remind me
of Adriaen the miller.

579
00:45:22,836 --> 00:45:24,770
I'm Adriaen the
miller's brother.

580
00:45:24,838 --> 00:45:26,772
The one that went
to the city, married...

581
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,774
a rich wife,
and became famous?

582
00:45:28,842 --> 00:45:30,776
That's right.

583
00:45:31,845 --> 00:45:33,779
Now you owe me a kiss.

584
00:45:33,847 --> 00:45:35,781
No, you owe me a
pot of beer.

585
00:45:35,849 --> 00:45:37,783
You mistook me for
my sister.

586
00:45:37,851 --> 00:45:39,785
- A kiss for beer?
- No.

587
00:45:39,853 --> 00:45:41,787
- A kiss for beer?
- Yes.

588
00:45:41,855 --> 00:45:43,789
Landlord, gallon of beer!

589
00:45:43,857 --> 00:45:45,791
Sutja, here's a man who
knows us...

590
00:45:45,859 --> 00:45:47,793
who orders beer by
the gallon.

591
00:45:47,861 --> 00:45:50,796
Don't have anything to do with
him. He's from the town.

592
00:45:50,864 --> 00:45:54,732
I've never been to the city.
Is it a merry life?

593
00:45:54,801 --> 00:45:56,735
Every day's a feast day.

594
00:45:57,804 --> 00:46:01,740
They hang sausages on the
doors instead of bellpulls...

595
00:46:01,808 --> 00:46:03,742
And the fountains
spurt wine.

596
00:46:09,816 --> 00:46:12,751
Take your ugly face away from
where it has no business to be.

597
00:46:12,819 --> 00:46:15,754
You old bullfrog! We don't allow
town oxen grazing on our pasture.

598
00:46:15,822 --> 00:46:17,756
He's not a stranger.

599
00:46:17,824 --> 00:46:19,758
He's the miller's brother, the
painter brother.

600
00:46:19,826 --> 00:46:23,762
I'll paint his nose red if he
doesn't keep his paws to himself.

601
00:46:23,830 --> 00:46:25,764
You're Jan Derricks,
aren't you?

602
00:46:25,832 --> 00:46:27,766
I used to lay you across my
knee and spank...

603
00:46:27,834 --> 00:46:29,768
you when you were a
lousy-headed pup.

604
00:46:29,836 --> 00:46:31,770
He talks as if he
belongs here...

605
00:46:31,838 --> 00:46:33,772
and looks as if he's come
from his own funeral.

606
00:46:35,842 --> 00:46:36,774
Now look here.

607
00:46:36,843 --> 00:46:40,779
I used to drink beer in this inn
when you lads were in napkins.

608
00:46:40,847 --> 00:46:44,783
I've still as good a seat to my
britches and as much right...

609
00:46:44,851 --> 00:46:46,785
to plant it where I choose as any
of you fat-rumped peasants!

610
00:46:46,853 --> 00:46:48,787
Leave me alone.

611
00:46:48,855 --> 00:46:50,789
Why do you come here
and make trouble?

612
00:46:50,857 --> 00:46:52,791
You were no use for us when
you were young.

613
00:46:52,859 --> 00:46:56,795
You went to the city because you
didn't like our country ways.

614
00:46:56,863 --> 00:47:00,799
If the smell of our pigsties is
too strong for you...

615
00:47:00,867 --> 00:47:02,801
keep your hands off
our bacon!

616
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:04,802
That's it.

617
00:47:04,871 --> 00:47:06,805
Get back to your city
wenches!

618
00:47:06,873 --> 00:47:08,807
Get out!

619
00:47:10,877 --> 00:47:13,812
I paid for my drink, and I've as much
right to drink it as anybody else!

620
00:47:16,883 --> 00:47:17,815
Drink that.

621
00:47:21,888 --> 00:47:23,822
Drink it yourself.

622
00:47:24,891 --> 00:47:27,826
Let's see if you've got
a miller's first!

623
00:47:27,894 --> 00:47:29,828
I'll show you what a painter's
first can do!

624
00:49:02,855 --> 00:49:05,790
I think I ought to go back to
Amsterdam, father.

625
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:09,794
God be with you, my boy.

626
00:49:39,892 --> 00:49:42,827
Titus!

627
00:49:43,896 --> 00:49:45,830
We shall be late. Can't you
hear the bells?

628
00:49:48,901 --> 00:49:51,836
Heaven have mercy on us.
Where will it all end?

629
00:49:51,904 --> 00:49:54,771
Three days and nights, and
not a sign of him.

630
00:49:54,841 --> 00:49:56,775
He treats his own house as
a plague spot.

631
00:49:56,843 --> 00:49:58,777
He avoids it because you make
his life impossible.

632
00:49:58,845 --> 00:50:00,779
Foolish, ignorant child.

633
00:50:00,847 --> 00:50:02,781
He's poisoning you with his
own wickedness.

634
00:50:02,849 --> 00:50:04,783
All right, let him go
his own way.

635
00:50:04,851 --> 00:50:06,785
Come on, come to church.

636
00:50:06,853 --> 00:50:09,788
And pray to God to make you a
better man than your father.

637
00:50:21,868 --> 00:50:22,800
Who are you?

638
00:50:22,869 --> 00:50:24,803
I'm the maid.

639
00:50:24,871 --> 00:50:26,805
How long have you
been here?

640
00:50:26,873 --> 00:50:28,807
Four weeks.

641
00:50:28,875 --> 00:50:30,809
I haven't seen you before.

642
00:50:31,878 --> 00:50:33,812
Where's the housekeeper?

643
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:35,814
She's gone to church.
It's Sunday.

644
00:50:40,887 --> 00:50:42,821
Come with me.

645
00:51:24,864 --> 00:51:26,798
Take off your shawl.

646
00:51:35,875 --> 00:51:37,809
You mustn't be frightened
if I look at you.

647
00:51:39,879 --> 00:51:41,813
I'm not looking at you as...

648
00:51:41,881 --> 00:51:43,815
a man looks.

649
00:51:46,886 --> 00:51:48,820
I'm a painter.

650
00:51:49,889 --> 00:51:52,824
Painters have a different way
of looking at things.

651
00:51:53,826 --> 00:51:56,260
You must imagine that I'm
looking at you in the...

652
00:51:56,329 --> 00:51:58,763
same way as the water with
which you wash yourself...

653
00:51:58,831 --> 00:52:02,767
or the air you move in or the
light that shines on you.

654
00:52:03,836 --> 00:52:07,772
That sees you all the time,
even when you're alone.

655
00:52:09,842 --> 00:52:11,776
You mustn't even know I'm
looking at you.

656
00:52:12,845 --> 00:52:14,779
Pretend I'm not in
the room.

657
00:52:14,847 --> 00:52:16,781
Well, I've disappeared.

658
00:52:21,854 --> 00:52:23,788
Make yourself comfortable.

659
00:52:25,858 --> 00:52:27,792
Are you warm enough?

660
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:30,795
Yes, but I ought to be cleaning
the vegetables.

661
00:52:30,863 --> 00:52:32,797
You shan't need any
vegetables today.

662
00:52:36,869 --> 00:52:38,803
What's your name?

663
00:52:38,871 --> 00:52:40,805
Hendrickje Stoffels.

664
00:52:40,873 --> 00:52:42,807
Hendrickje...
from the country?

665
00:52:42,875 --> 00:52:44,809
From Zeeland, my mother
has a little farm.

666
00:52:45,878 --> 00:52:47,812
Why did you leave
the country?

667
00:52:48,881 --> 00:52:51,816
I don't know. I didn't want
to stay at home.

668
00:52:52,852 --> 00:52:54,752
I'm very glad you came,
Hendrickje.

669
00:52:57,823 --> 00:53:00,758
That's no good. I want that
frightened look.

670
00:53:00,826 --> 00:53:02,760
But I don't feel frightened
anymore.

671
00:53:05,831 --> 00:53:09,767
So you don't feel frightened
anymore, Hendrickje?

672
00:53:43,869 --> 00:53:46,804
Pretty tune. Is it one of your
country songs?

673
00:53:46,872 --> 00:53:48,806
Yes, they sing it at home
in Zeeland.

674
00:53:48,874 --> 00:53:49,806
Well, go on.

675
00:53:49,875 --> 00:53:51,809
The next verse is
a sad one.

676
00:53:51,877 --> 00:53:54,744
Look at the dirt on
this table.

677
00:53:54,814 --> 00:53:56,748
You'd think it hadn't been
cleaned for years.

678
00:53:56,816 --> 00:53:57,748
Nor it has.

679
00:53:57,817 --> 00:54:00,752
Father kept it locked, wouldn't
let anyone in.

680
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:03,755
Who's the woman in
this picture?

681
00:54:05,825 --> 00:54:07,759
My mother.

682
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:09,761
She must have been
very beautiful.

683
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:15,767
What are you doing in here? The
kitchen's the place for you.

684
00:54:15,835 --> 00:54:17,769
I told you not to talk to her.

685
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:19,771
He gave me permission to
tidy the studio.

686
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:21,773
And I forbade you to set foot
in this room!

687
00:54:21,841 --> 00:54:23,775
You get downstairs where you
belong and don't let me find...

688
00:54:23,843 --> 00:54:24,775
you up here again.

689
00:54:24,844 --> 00:54:26,778
And keep your hands
off that boy.

690
00:54:26,846 --> 00:54:28,780
I suppose the father
isn't enough!

691
00:54:28,848 --> 00:54:30,782
Don't speak to her like that.
It's wicked and ugly.

692
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:34,786
Wicked, ugly? That's the thanks
I get for my years of se<i>rv</i>ice?

693
00:54:34,854 --> 00:54:36,788
Where would you be if it
wasn't for me?

694
00:54:36,856 --> 00:54:38,790
My whole life I've
worked for him.

695
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:40,792
I've kept his house clean,
cooked for him...

696
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:42,794
scrubbed for him, nursed
him when he was sick.

697
00:54:42,862 --> 00:54:43,794
I've brought up his child.

698
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:46,798
My whole life's been for him
and his happiness.

699
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:50,802
Now I'm no use to him anymore.
He prefers his kitchen maid.

700
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:53,737
But you needn't worry,
it won't last.

701
00:54:53,806 --> 00:54:55,740
He'll treat you as he's
treated me.

702
00:54:55,808 --> 00:54:58,743
You don't belong round here.
We don't want you round here.

703
00:54:58,811 --> 00:55:01,746
Get out of the house and leave
him alone, can't you?

704
00:55:01,814 --> 00:55:03,748
No, I can't.

705
00:55:04,817 --> 00:55:05,749
You can't?

706
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:09,754
All right. I can.

707
00:55:10,823 --> 00:55:12,757
One of us has got to go.

708
00:55:14,827 --> 00:55:17,762
I'll make you sorry for this.

709
00:55:19,832 --> 00:55:23,768
I'll make you sorry you
were ever born.

710
00:55:35,848 --> 00:55:37,782
Heertsbeeke, the lawyer, my
friends, Dr. Fabrizius...

711
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:39,784
Dr. Menaseeh and Titus,
of course.

712
00:55:41,854 --> 00:55:45,790
And what can I do for
you, Rembrandt?

713
00:55:49,862 --> 00:55:51,796
I'm going to be
married again.

714
00:55:51,864 --> 00:55:53,729
All right, I know I'm
an old fool.

715
00:55:53,799 --> 00:55:56,734
When King David was old and
stricken in years...

716
00:55:56,802 --> 00:56:00,738
he took unto himself Abishag.
The shunamite. King Solomon.

717
00:56:00,806 --> 00:56:03,741
Enough of your Old Testament Kings.
They all came to a bad end.

718
00:56:03,809 --> 00:56:06,744
I asked you here to be witnesses
to my marriage.

719
00:56:06,812 --> 00:56:09,747
- Only too glad, Rembrandt.
- I want you to settle the formalities.

720
00:56:09,815 --> 00:56:12,750
You can't get out of it so
easily as that.

721
00:56:12,818 --> 00:56:14,752
Get out? Get out
of what?

722
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:16,754
The lady Saskia Van
Uylenburgh...

723
00:56:16,822 --> 00:56:19,757
Left her fortune to her beloved
Rembrandt Van Rijn...

724
00:56:19,825 --> 00:56:22,760
with the proviso that in the
event of his remarriage...

725
00:56:22,828 --> 00:56:24,762
he must make over 1/2 of
the fortune...

726
00:56:24,830 --> 00:56:26,764
to her son Titus.

727
00:56:26,832 --> 00:56:28,766
Half of 40.000 florins...

728
00:56:28,834 --> 00:56:30,768
I never got a penny
of the 40,000.

729
00:56:30,836 --> 00:56:32,770
I know, but you accepted
the bequest.

730
00:56:32,838 --> 00:56:35,773
And so far as the law is concerned,
the obligation is undischarged.

731
00:56:35,841 --> 00:56:37,775
You cannot get
married again...

732
00:56:37,843 --> 00:56:40,778
unless you pay into the
court of chancellery...

733
00:56:40,846 --> 00:56:43,781
the sum of 20.000 florins for
your son Titus.

734
00:56:43,849 --> 00:56:46,784
20.000 florins.

735
00:56:49,855 --> 00:56:51,789
But it's ridiculous. I don't
want the money.

736
00:56:51,857 --> 00:56:54,792
I'll simply renounce
my claim.

737
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:56,794
You can't do that, my boy.

738
00:56:56,862 --> 00:56:58,796
You're underage.

739
00:56:58,864 --> 00:57:01,799
And the court of chancellery has no
intention of forfeiting this money.

740
00:57:01,867 --> 00:57:03,801
They're very sharp
on these things.

741
00:57:03,869 --> 00:57:07,805
- Why am I only 18?
- Shut up, Titus!

742
00:57:07,873 --> 00:57:10,808
You're too young to
know the world.

743
00:57:10,876 --> 00:57:13,811
You think it's a free place where you
can do as you choose. You're wrong.

744
00:57:13,879 --> 00:57:19,818
The world is a narrow cage
enclosed on 4 sides by iron bars.

745
00:57:19,885 --> 00:57:22,820
You beat your head against those
bars until you're sick...

746
00:57:23,889 --> 00:57:25,823
but you'll never get out...

747
00:57:25,891 --> 00:57:27,825
never as long as you live.

748
00:57:45,911 --> 00:57:47,845
I interrogated the
accused woman.

749
00:57:47,913 --> 00:57:50,848
Listen to the words of
her defence.

750
00:57:50,916 --> 00:57:53,783
Why did she submit to this
man's desires?

751
00:57:53,853 --> 00:57:56,788
"Because he was kind to me, kinder
than anyone had ever been."

752
00:57:56,856 --> 00:57:58,790
Why did she refuse to
abandon him?

753
00:57:58,858 --> 00:58:01,793
"Because I belonged to him,
and he needs me."

754
00:58:01,861 --> 00:58:04,796
Is that the voice of
lust, of sin?

755
00:58:04,864 --> 00:58:06,798
It is the voice of sin
which seeks to...

756
00:58:06,866 --> 00:58:09,801
dissemble and disguise
its true face.

757
00:58:09,869 --> 00:58:11,803
Such a woman is more
dangerous than...

758
00:58:11,871 --> 00:58:14,806
the vice which flaunts itself
at street corners.

759
00:58:14,874 --> 00:58:18,810
Such hypocrisy spreads the
poison of sacrilege...

760
00:58:18,878 --> 00:58:21,813
and sows the seeds of evil
desire in our midst.

761
00:58:21,881 --> 00:58:24,816
I ask you, dear brethren...

762
00:58:24,884 --> 00:58:28,820
why should that which is forbidden
to us, honest and honourable...

763
00:58:28,888 --> 00:58:30,822
citizens, be permitted to a
loose-living painter?

764
00:58:30,890 --> 00:58:34,826
Why should he live in open sin
with his concubine...

765
00:58:34,894 --> 00:58:37,829
whilst we are bound by the rules
and teachings of the church?

766
00:58:38,898 --> 00:58:39,830
No.

767
00:58:39,899 --> 00:58:42,834
An example must be
made here.

768
00:58:42,902 --> 00:58:44,836
The black sheep must
be driven out.

769
00:58:46,906 --> 00:58:48,840
Hendrickje Stoffels...

770
00:58:49,909 --> 00:58:52,878
your life and actions, being such
as to offend against the...

771
00:58:52,878 --> 00:58:56,780
public decency of
excommunication upon you.

772
00:58:56,849 --> 00:58:59,784
Henceforth, you are forbidden
to enter the House of God...

773
00:59:00,853 --> 00:59:03,788
and to partake of the
holy sacrament.

774
00:59:16,869 --> 00:59:20,805
On behalf of the bankruptcy court
I open the forced sale...

775
00:59:20,873 --> 00:59:24,809
of all the movable and immovable
property of the painter Rembrandt.

776
00:59:26,879 --> 00:59:29,814
Can you hear them selling our
furniture downstairs?

777
00:59:29,882 --> 00:59:31,816
I don't mind.
I'm very happy.

778
00:59:31,884 --> 00:59:35,820
Are you, When we haven't got a
proper house to go to?

779
00:59:35,888 --> 00:59:37,822
We have a little house.
That's all we need.

780
00:59:38,891 --> 00:59:40,825
Yes, that's all we need.

781
00:59:40,893 --> 00:59:42,827
You know, I never liked
this huge place.

782
00:59:42,895 --> 00:59:44,829
At first, it used to
frighten me.

783
00:59:44,897 --> 00:59:47,832
Then I used to think you needed
it to paint pictures in.

784
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:51,836
But now I know that all you need
is a warm coat, hot soup...

785
00:59:51,904 --> 00:59:53,769
and maybe me.

786
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:56,774
You know, I've come
into a fortune.

787
00:59:56,842 --> 00:59:59,777
Even though they're selling my
furniture downstairs.

788
01:00:00,846 --> 01:00:01,778
Come.

789
01:00:22,868 --> 01:00:25,803
He was a good man.
A just man.

790
01:00:25,871 --> 01:00:28,806
He didn't dese<i>rv</i>e this.

791
01:00:28,874 --> 01:00:31,809
Dese<i>rv</i>e? What does
that mean?

792
01:00:31,877 --> 01:00:35,813
A man without money is a
vagabond and a rogue.

793
01:01:02,841 --> 01:01:05,776
Rembrandt, I brought you a buyer
for your new picture.

794
01:01:05,844 --> 01:01:09,780
This is the Marquis de Guyencourt.
He's just arrived from Paris.

795
01:01:09,848 --> 01:01:11,782
And he has a commission to buy art
treasures for the Cardinal.

796
01:01:11,850 --> 01:01:12,782
Thank you.

797
01:01:38,877 --> 01:01:40,811
Does the Marquis like
this one?

798
01:01:42,881 --> 01:01:45,816
The Holy Family in flight
from Egypt.

799
01:01:47,886 --> 01:01:49,820
The blessed virgin
without a halo?

800
01:01:49,888 --> 01:01:52,858
Yes, without a halo. Sanctity
comes from within.

801
01:01:52,858 --> 01:01:55,759
One isn't obliged to wear it on the
head like a Flemish hat.

802
01:01:56,829 --> 01:01:58,763
I'll buy the picture.

803
01:01:58,831 --> 01:02:00,765
Will you accept 1,000 florins?

804
01:02:06,839 --> 01:02:08,773
1,000 florins.

805
01:02:09,842 --> 01:02:11,776
This is my wife.

806
01:02:12,845 --> 01:02:13,777
Shall I... would you...

807
01:02:13,846 --> 01:02:16,781
Shall I send it or...

808
01:02:16,849 --> 01:02:18,783
I'll put it on the carriage.

809
01:02:20,853 --> 01:02:22,787
- You can't do it, father.
- I can't do what?

810
01:02:22,855 --> 01:02:24,789
- The debtors' court order.
- What more do they want from me?

811
01:02:24,857 --> 01:02:26,791
The court decided
your canvases...

812
01:02:26,859 --> 01:02:29,794
become the property
of your creditors.

813
01:02:29,862 --> 01:02:31,796
The house didn't fetch enough to
cover all your debts.

814
01:02:31,864 --> 01:02:32,796
Shut up.

815
01:02:32,865 --> 01:02:36,801
They'll put him in jail. Ludwick's
threatened to have him arrested.

816
01:02:36,869 --> 01:02:38,803
He mustn't sell
his pictures.

817
01:02:38,871 --> 01:02:42,807
He's under oath to hand over his
work until his debts are cleared.

818
01:02:42,875 --> 01:02:45,810
- According to the Commercial Charter...
- Commercial Charter?

819
01:02:45,878 --> 01:02:47,812
I'm not a tradesman.

820
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:50,815
The picture I paint with my own
hands belongs to me.

821
01:02:54,820 --> 01:02:57,755
No, father, it doesn't
belong to you.

822
01:02:57,823 --> 01:02:59,757
You've no right to sell it.

823
01:03:09,835 --> 01:03:12,770
I'm sorry. I should have been
glad to buy the picture.

824
01:03:29,855 --> 01:03:32,790
I'll... go for a walk.

825
01:03:53,812 --> 01:03:55,746
You must explain to me...

826
01:03:56,815 --> 01:03:58,749
why don't his pictures belong
to him anymore?

827
01:03:58,817 --> 01:04:01,752
Listen, Hendrickje, I'll give
you an example.

828
01:04:02,821 --> 01:04:06,757
Imagine that the fisherman owes
money that he can't pay.

829
01:04:06,825 --> 01:04:08,759
If he catches fish and takes
it to the market...

830
01:04:08,827 --> 01:04:10,761
he's not allowed to
offer it for sale.

831
01:04:10,829 --> 01:04:14,765
<i>According to the law, he has to</i>
<i>hand it over to his creditors.</i>

832
01:04:16,835 --> 01:04:19,770
Caught you, my fine little fellow,
you haven't paid your taxes...

833
01:04:19,838 --> 01:04:22,773
therefore, any fish you catch
are public property.

834
01:04:22,841 --> 01:04:24,775
That's the law in Holland.

835
01:04:24,843 --> 01:04:26,777
You let Jan Butting alone.

836
01:04:26,845 --> 01:04:29,780
He's my assistant. I employ
him, see?

837
01:04:29,848 --> 01:04:31,782
He gets his food and
lodging from me...

838
01:04:31,850 --> 01:04:34,785
and any fish he catches
are mine.

839
01:04:34,853 --> 01:04:36,787
And there's a contract
to prove it.

840
01:04:36,855 --> 01:04:41,792
You can't arrest me for selling
fish, old dog's face.

841
01:04:42,861 --> 01:04:45,796
And that's the law
in Holland.

842
01:04:47,866 --> 01:04:49,800
So, that's the law
in Holland.

843
01:04:59,811 --> 01:05:01,745
Ludwick.

844
01:05:03,815 --> 01:05:05,749
You go on as if nothing
had happened.

845
01:05:05,817 --> 01:05:07,751
You go upstairs. I'll
deal with them.

846
01:05:10,822 --> 01:05:12,756
We'll be all right
up here.

847
01:05:16,828 --> 01:05:18,762
What can I do for you,
gentlemen?

848
01:05:18,830 --> 01:05:21,765
We represent the creditors to whom
the painter Rembrandt owes money.

849
01:05:21,833 --> 01:05:23,767
Does that convey anything
to you?

850
01:05:23,835 --> 01:05:25,769
I can't see what it has
to do with me?

851
01:05:25,837 --> 01:05:29,773
Breaking the law. These picture for
sale don't belong to you at all.

852
01:05:29,841 --> 01:05:30,773
Indeed?

853
01:05:30,842 --> 01:05:32,776
Everything that Rembrandt
paints, draws...

854
01:05:32,844 --> 01:05:34,778
or otherwise commits
paper...

855
01:05:34,846 --> 01:05:36,780
belongs to the creditors and must,
in law, be handed over to them.

856
01:05:36,848 --> 01:05:38,782
I happen to know that
you've already sold...

857
01:05:38,850 --> 01:05:40,784
one picture to France
for 1,000 florins.

858
01:05:40,852 --> 01:05:43,787
I suppose you realize that this
is a criminal offence.

859
01:05:43,855 --> 01:05:46,790
If you're speaking of the painter
Rembrandt Van Rijn...

860
01:05:46,858 --> 01:05:49,793
this man is in my employ. I own
the contract with him.

861
01:05:49,861 --> 01:05:51,795
He receives his food and
lodging from me...

862
01:05:51,863 --> 01:05:55,731
and in return, whatever he chooses
to paint becomes my property.

863
01:05:55,801 --> 01:05:57,735
Mine, gentlemen,
not yours.

864
01:05:57,803 --> 01:06:00,738
You can't take anything from me.
I don't owe you a brass farthing.

865
01:06:00,806 --> 01:06:02,740
That's the law in Holland.

866
01:06:02,808 --> 01:06:04,742
Can we see this
so-called contract?

867
01:06:04,810 --> 01:06:06,744
There's nothing in the
Commercial Charter...

868
01:06:06,812 --> 01:06:08,746
She talks about the
Commercial Charter?

869
01:06:08,814 --> 01:06:10,748
The woman can't
read or write.

870
01:06:10,816 --> 01:06:12,750
Why should I? I have a partner
who's wee-educated.

871
01:06:12,818 --> 01:06:13,750
Titus?

872
01:06:13,819 --> 01:06:15,753
My partner.

873
01:06:16,822 --> 01:06:18,756
We'd better go to the
painter himself.

874
01:06:19,825 --> 01:06:21,759
- Where are you going?
- To see Rembandt.

875
01:06:21,827 --> 01:06:23,761
I don't allow my se<i>rv</i>ants
to receive visitors...

876
01:06:23,829 --> 01:06:26,764
during working hours, and
he works 24 hours a day.

877
01:06:26,832 --> 01:06:28,766
This is trickery! She's the painter's
wife the mother of his child.

878
01:06:28,834 --> 01:06:29,766
What belongs to her
belongs to him.

879
01:06:29,835 --> 01:06:31,769
She has no right to make any
bargain with him.

880
01:06:31,837 --> 01:06:33,771
I'm going to the court.

881
01:06:33,839 --> 01:06:36,774
I'd advise you to see my lawyer
first. He drew up the contract.

882
01:06:36,842 --> 01:06:39,777
- It may save you a walk.
- Hold your tongue.

883
01:06:45,851 --> 01:06:47,785
You were superb.

884
01:06:49,855 --> 01:06:50,787
Splendid, splendid!

885
01:06:50,856 --> 01:06:52,790
Bless your heart.

886
01:06:54,860 --> 01:06:55,792
Wasn't she ma<i>rv</i>ellous?

887
01:06:55,861 --> 01:06:58,796
You wait. They'll be back
in half an hour...

888
01:06:58,864 --> 01:07:00,798
begging you to give them an
interest in the business.

889
01:07:01,867 --> 01:07:04,802
You'd better take a rest. You're
as white as a sheet.

890
01:07:04,870 --> 01:07:07,805
- I must get to the kitchen.
- You'll do nothing of the kind.

891
01:07:08,874 --> 01:07:09,806
Sit down.

892
01:07:15,881 --> 01:07:17,815
What do you employ me for,
if I'm not cook for you?

893
01:07:17,883 --> 01:07:20,818
I've heard it said that painters
are good cooks.

894
01:07:20,886 --> 01:07:23,821
It's part of our trade. I learned
cooking when I was an apprentice.

895
01:07:23,889 --> 01:07:25,823
But we're having goose.

896
01:07:25,891 --> 01:07:27,825
And do you think I don't know
how to cook a goose?

897
01:07:28,894 --> 01:07:31,829
Come on, Menasseh. You'll help me
with the apples and the chestnuts.

898
01:07:31,897 --> 01:07:33,831
Now, you stay there
and rest.

899
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:36,834
Come on, Menasseh.

900
01:07:48,914 --> 01:07:50,848
There you are.

901
01:08:15,874 --> 01:08:17,808
You're very handy with
the pots and pans.

902
01:08:19,878 --> 01:08:21,812
I spent a lot of my
life alone.

903
01:08:38,897 --> 01:08:40,831
Tell me the truth,
Menasseh.

904
01:08:42,901 --> 01:08:45,836
- How long will Hendrichje live?
- What?

905
01:08:48,907 --> 01:08:50,841
I can't lie to you.

906
01:08:54,846 --> 01:08:55,778
How long?

907
01:08:57,849 --> 01:08:59,783
That is god's
hands.

908
01:09:05,857 --> 01:09:07,791
She mustn't suspect that
I know anything.

909
01:09:08,860 --> 01:09:10,794
It would break
her heart.

910
01:09:11,863 --> 01:09:14,798
- But if she asks me?
- Then you must lie.

911
01:09:14,866 --> 01:09:16,800
But I tell you, I can't lie.

912
01:09:16,868 --> 01:09:19,803
You must learn to lie,
Menasseh.

913
01:09:19,871 --> 01:09:21,805
<i>Dr. Menasseh?</i>

914
01:09:21,873 --> 01:09:23,807
<i>Come help me</i>
<i>lay the table.</i>

915
01:09:23,875 --> 01:09:25,809
Yes. I'm coming.

916
01:09:32,884 --> 01:09:35,819
Hurry up with the table. The
goose is nearly done.

917
01:09:39,891 --> 01:09:42,826
Careful, doctor. See the
joints are straight.

918
01:09:43,895 --> 01:09:45,829
You should hire
a se<i>rv</i>ant girl.

919
01:09:45,897 --> 01:09:47,831
Take on a se<i>rv</i>ant and have her
get into debt again?

920
01:09:47,899 --> 01:09:50,834
We're tightening our purse
strings now.

921
01:09:50,902 --> 01:09:53,769
But you must take care
of your health.

922
01:09:53,838 --> 01:09:56,773
You've grown more delicate
since the child was born.

923
01:09:56,841 --> 01:09:58,775
Nursing her was too great
a strain on you.

924
01:09:58,843 --> 01:10:00,777
That's why I sent her away to my
mother in the country.

925
01:10:00,845 --> 01:10:03,780
But you need rest
and care.

926
01:10:09,854 --> 01:10:15,793
I shall go when my task is done
note sooner and note later.

927
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:17,794
Will you do something
to help me?

928
01:10:17,862 --> 01:10:19,796
If it's possible.

929
01:10:21,866 --> 01:10:23,800
He mustn't know
about me.

930
01:10:23,868 --> 01:10:26,803
These good times mustn't be
spoiled for him.

931
01:10:26,871 --> 01:10:29,806
You don't think he
suspects, do you?

932
01:10:31,876 --> 01:10:32,808
No.

933
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:36,812
The goose, the goose.

934
01:10:36,881 --> 01:10:38,815
Titus.

935
01:10:40,885 --> 01:10:42,819
The goose. Sit down.

936
01:10:43,888 --> 01:10:45,822
Sit down, everybody.

937
01:10:54,833 --> 01:10:57,768
No, Rembrandt. It can't
be done.

938
01:10:57,836 --> 01:11:00,771
A marriage cannot be arranged
in such a short time.

939
01:11:00,839 --> 01:11:02,773
And after all...

940
01:11:02,841 --> 01:11:04,775
why all this hurry?

941
01:11:04,843 --> 01:11:08,779
Can't you wait 4 weeks to marry
her like any ordinary person?

942
01:11:08,847 --> 01:11:09,779
No, Pastor.

943
01:11:09,848 --> 01:11:11,782
Why?

944
01:11:12,851 --> 01:11:15,786
Because she has a very
short time to live.

945
01:11:16,855 --> 01:11:19,790
I want to make her happy
before she dies.

946
01:11:21,860 --> 01:11:23,794
Have you disposed of
all the obstacles...

947
01:11:23,862 --> 01:11:26,797
that stood in the way of
your marriage?

948
01:11:26,865 --> 01:11:28,799
Yes. My son is
of age now.

949
01:11:28,867 --> 01:11:30,801
I don't need any money.

950
01:11:31,870 --> 01:11:33,804
I'll try to arrange it as
quickly as I can.

951
01:11:33,872 --> 01:11:38,809
Could it be managed next Sunday?
She has so little time.

952
01:11:39,878 --> 01:11:41,812
Very well.

953
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:44,815
I'll see that it's arranged
at once.

954
01:11:45,884 --> 01:11:48,819
Will you go and fetch the child and
bring Hendrickje's mother, too?

955
01:11:48,887 --> 01:11:51,822
Take the next coach and
be back in 3 days.

956
01:12:05,837 --> 01:12:08,772
You mustn't work.
You must rest.

957
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:10,774
- You look tired.
- Where's Titus?

958
01:12:10,842 --> 01:12:12,776
Titus? He's with his
young bride.

959
01:12:13,845 --> 01:12:15,779
He'll be leaving us soon, and we
shall be left alone.

960
01:12:15,847 --> 01:12:18,782
- You'd like that?
- Yes.

961
01:12:19,851 --> 01:12:22,786
And the baby, do you
miss her?

962
01:12:25,857 --> 01:12:27,791
She's being well cared for
in the country...

963
01:12:27,859 --> 01:12:30,794
but I thought perhaps next summer
I'd have her back again.

964
01:12:30,862 --> 01:12:32,796
Yes. Next summer.

965
01:12:32,864 --> 01:12:34,798
What have you got on
that dress for?

966
01:12:34,866 --> 01:12:36,800
I thought you wanted to
finish the picture.

967
01:12:36,868 --> 01:12:39,803
- It's Sunday.
- Yes. We must finish the picture.

968
01:12:39,871 --> 01:12:42,806
You can rest in the big chair
while I'm working.

969
01:12:42,874 --> 01:12:43,806
Come on.

970
01:13:01,826 --> 01:13:03,760
It's just like the first time.

971
01:13:03,828 --> 01:13:05,762
The house was empty, and
we were alone.

972
01:13:05,830 --> 01:13:08,765
You pulled me upstairs,
just like now.

973
01:13:08,833 --> 01:13:10,767
I remember.

974
01:13:28,853 --> 01:13:29,785
Sit down.

975
01:13:48,873 --> 01:13:50,807
"I'm not looking at you...

976
01:13:50,875 --> 01:13:53,742
as a man looks. I'm a painter.
That's what I said."

977
01:13:53,812 --> 01:13:58,749
"You must imagine I look at you
in the same way as the water...

978
01:13:58,817 --> 01:14:01,752
you wash yourself with or
the air you move in...

979
01:14:01,820 --> 01:14:03,754
or the light that
shines on you.

980
01:14:03,822 --> 01:14:07,758
That sees you, you know, all the
time even when you're quite alone."

981
01:14:07,826 --> 01:14:10,761
"You mustn't even know I'm
looking at you.

982
01:14:10,829 --> 01:14:12,763
Pretend I'm not in
the room."

983
01:14:14,833 --> 01:14:17,768
Now you must ask me if
I'm warm enough.

984
01:14:17,836 --> 01:14:19,770
"Are you warm enough?"

985
01:14:19,838 --> 01:14:22,773
"Yes, but I ought to be cleaning
the vegetables."

986
01:14:22,841 --> 01:14:25,776
"We shan't need any
vegetables today."

987
01:14:26,845 --> 01:14:28,779
Now you must ask
me my name.

988
01:14:28,847 --> 01:14:30,781
What a memory
you've got.

989
01:14:32,851 --> 01:14:35,786
Don't tell me any more.
I know the rest.

990
01:14:36,855 --> 01:14:38,789
"What's your name?"

991
01:14:38,857 --> 01:14:40,791
"Hendrickje Stoffels."

992
01:14:41,860 --> 01:14:43,794
"Hendrickje... are you from
the country?"

993
01:14:43,862 --> 01:14:46,797
"From Zeeland. My mother
has a little farm."

994
01:14:46,865 --> 01:14:48,799
"Why did you leave
the country?"

995
01:14:48,867 --> 01:14:51,802
"I don't know. I didn't want
to stay at home."

996
01:15:09,821 --> 01:15:12,756
"You know how glad I am that
you came, Hendrichje."

997
01:15:26,838 --> 01:15:27,770
Darling?

998
01:15:30,842 --> 01:15:31,774
Sweetheart?

999
01:15:33,845 --> 01:15:35,779
Hendrickje!

1000
01:15:49,861 --> 01:15:52,796
<i>Fresh herrings!</i>

1001
01:15:54,799 --> 01:15:56,733
Herrings?

1002
01:16:06,811 --> 01:16:10,747
How much are you charging this
morning, milord fishmonger?

1003
01:16:10,815 --> 01:16:12,749
The same as I
charged yesterday...

1004
01:16:12,817 --> 01:16:14,751
evening one heller, your
royal highness.

1005
01:16:19,824 --> 01:16:23,760
Here's half a heller. I'm not
paying for the smell.

1006
01:16:34,839 --> 01:16:37,774
Here we are. The
Full Moon Bodega.

1007
01:16:37,842 --> 01:16:39,776
I'm paying for everybody.

1008
01:16:39,844 --> 01:16:41,778
And anyone who leaves before
the new moon rises...

1009
01:16:41,846 --> 01:16:43,780
is no longer a friend
of mine.

1010
01:16:44,849 --> 01:16:45,781
You're a prince.

1011
01:16:45,850 --> 01:16:47,784
He sold his first picture
this morning...

1012
01:16:47,852 --> 01:16:49,786
and he wants to spend
it all at once.

1013
01:16:49,854 --> 01:16:51,788
There's genius for you.

1014
01:16:51,856 --> 01:16:54,791
Anybody who's afraid to squander
the first 1,000 florins...

1015
01:16:54,859 --> 01:16:56,793
he's earned doesn't dese<i>rv</i>e
to earn any more.

1016
01:16:56,861 --> 01:17:00,797
Coachman, unharness the horses.
Come on in with us.

1017
01:17:00,865 --> 01:17:02,799
Come on.

1018
01:17:09,874 --> 01:17:12,809
Not in front of all
these people!

1019
01:17:12,877 --> 01:17:15,812
What does it matter? They're all
drunk, and no one else is looking.

1020
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:17,814
That old man over there is.
He's laughing at us.

1021
01:17:17,882 --> 01:17:19,816
Why are you laughing,
grandpa?

1022
01:17:19,884 --> 01:17:23,820
Because I see a sight that
warms my old heart.

1023
01:17:24,889 --> 01:17:26,823
He's sweet. Ask him to
come with us.

1024
01:17:26,891 --> 01:17:28,825
I'll be getting jealous
in a minute.

1025
01:17:28,893 --> 01:17:32,829
Don't worry. They won't
want to kiss me.

1026
01:17:34,899 --> 01:17:36,833
Come on, grandpa.
You must be thirsty.

1027
01:17:36,901 --> 01:17:38,835
I am.

1028
01:17:38,903 --> 01:17:41,838
This herring was as salt
as the North Sea.

1029
01:17:42,907 --> 01:17:45,842
Fine head the old man has.
He'd make a good model.

1030
01:17:45,910 --> 01:17:47,844
You'll have to sing
for your supper.

1031
01:17:47,912 --> 01:17:49,846
Preach us a sermon or
tell us a funny story.

1032
01:17:49,914 --> 01:17:52,884
You look as if you've a pretty wit
under that turban of yours.

1033
01:17:52,884 --> 01:17:56,786
My wit is a delicate plant,
gentlemen.

1034
01:17:56,854 --> 01:17:58,788
It needs watering.

1035
01:17:58,856 --> 01:18:01,791
We'll water it with anything
you like, beer or brandy.

1036
01:18:01,859 --> 01:18:02,791
Come on.

1037
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:24,814
Drink! Drink! Drink!
Drink! Drink!

1038
01:18:24,882 --> 01:18:26,816
A toast, my friends,
to beauty.

1039
01:18:26,884 --> 01:18:28,818
- To woman.
- To youth.

1040
01:18:28,886 --> 01:18:30,820
- To love.
- To money.

1041
01:18:30,888 --> 01:18:31,820
To success.

1042
01:18:35,893 --> 01:18:37,827
What about you,
grandpa?

1043
01:18:37,895 --> 01:18:39,829
- You haven't given us your toast.
- I can't think of a toast.

1044
01:18:39,897 --> 01:18:42,832
You mumbled something into
your glass just now.

1045
01:18:42,900 --> 01:18:44,834
- I heard you.
- I heard you, too.

1046
01:18:44,902 --> 01:18:46,836
That wasn't a toast. They
weren't my words.

1047
01:18:46,904 --> 01:18:48,838
Well, whose words
were they, then?

1048
01:18:50,908 --> 01:18:53,775
They were the words
of King Solomon.

1049
01:18:53,845 --> 01:18:56,780
They are the best
words I know.

1050
01:18:56,848 --> 01:19:01,785
Let's have them. You can be King
Solomon, and teach us wisdom.

1051
01:19:03,855 --> 01:19:05,789
"Vanity of vanities.

1052
01:19:05,857 --> 01:19:07,791
All is vanity."

1053
01:19:07,859 --> 01:19:08,791
Bravo!

1054
01:19:11,863 --> 01:19:13,797
Go on, grandpa.

1055
01:19:13,865 --> 01:19:17,801
"I have seen all the works that
are done under the sun...

1056
01:19:17,869 --> 01:19:19,803
and behold...

1057
01:19:19,871 --> 01:19:21,805
all is vanity...

1058
01:19:22,874 --> 01:19:24,808
and vexations of Spirit.

1059
01:19:26,878 --> 01:19:29,813
For, in much wisdom...

1060
01:19:29,881 --> 01:19:31,815
is much grief...

1061
01:19:32,884 --> 01:19:34,818
and he that increaseth
knowledge...

1062
01:19:35,887 --> 01:19:37,821
increaseth sorrow.

1063
01:19:39,891 --> 01:19:41,825
Wherefore, I perceive...

1064
01:19:41,893 --> 01:19:44,828
that there is nothing better than
that a man shall rejoice...

1065
01:19:44,896 --> 01:19:46,830
in his own works.

1066
01:19:47,899 --> 01:19:49,833
For that is his portion."

1067
01:20:01,846 --> 01:20:03,780
Rembrandt.

1068
01:20:06,851 --> 01:20:08,785
Rembrandt?

1069
01:20:09,854 --> 01:20:11,788
I'm very sorry.

1070
01:20:11,856 --> 01:20:13,790
We didn't know.

1071
01:20:15,860 --> 01:20:18,795
I enjoyed myself
very much.

1072
01:20:18,863 --> 01:20:20,797
Amuse yourselves...

1073
01:20:20,865 --> 01:20:23,800
and remember
King Solomon.

1074
01:20:23,868 --> 01:20:25,802
May I?

1075
01:20:34,879 --> 01:20:36,813
Good night, children.

1076
01:20:44,889 --> 01:20:46,823
I thought I'd never
find you. I called...

1077
01:20:46,891 --> 01:20:48,825
at your studio 3 times
last week.

1078
01:20:48,893 --> 01:20:52,864
I know. I was busy. I've just
started a new portrait of myself.

1079
01:20:52,864 --> 01:20:54,764
I see.

1080
01:20:54,832 --> 01:20:56,766
I just wanted to find out if you
had enough to eat.

1081
01:20:56,834 --> 01:20:59,769
- Shall I come back now?
- No, I can manage...

1082
01:20:59,837 --> 01:21:01,771
but if you happen to have
a spare florin.

1083
01:21:01,839 --> 01:21:03,773
Of course, of course. Here.

1084
01:21:06,844 --> 01:21:07,776
Take this.

1085
01:21:08,846 --> 01:21:10,780
- No, five. No.
- No. Nonsense, nonsense.

1086
01:21:10,848 --> 01:21:12,782
But, mind you, spend
it on food, now.

1087
01:21:12,850 --> 01:21:14,784
Of course, of course.

1088
01:21:14,852 --> 01:21:18,788
You'd better go straight to the
butcher's. You're not looking well.

1089
01:21:18,856 --> 01:21:21,791
That's the light. You needn't worry
about me. I'm quite all right.

1090
01:21:21,859 --> 01:21:23,793
You're a good lad,
Fabrizius.

1091
01:21:23,861 --> 01:21:26,796
Go, along to this place here. The
meat there is good and cheap.

1092
01:21:26,864 --> 01:21:29,799
Yes, I'll go to the
butcher's.

1093
01:21:34,872 --> 01:21:37,807
- Now, goodbye.
- Goodbye. Take care of yourself.

1094
01:22:02,833 --> 01:22:04,767
Get out of here!

1095
01:23:15,439 --> 01:23:19,375
"Vanity of vanities.
All is vanity."

1096
01:23:51,876 --> 01:23:58,748
THE END
