anything you're good at?

Yes, coach.

Mm-hmm.

Good.

Varsity trials were last spring,
mr. Salvatore.

00:09:43,527 --> 00:09:44,827
I wasn't
here then, sir.

00:09:44,895 --> 00:09:47,263
And you're not here now,
as far as I'm concerned.

191
00:09:48,265 --> 00:09:50,466
Mr. Tanner, I realize
that you and I

192
00:09:50,534 --> 00:09:51,934
Didn't get off
to the best start,

193
00:09:52,002 --> 00:09:54,570
And I want
to apologize for that.

194

Dude, this is an opportunity.

205

Football's a contact sport.

206
00:10:27,805 --> 00:10:29,572
Sometimes people get hurt.

207

where is caroline?

I don't know.
It's not like her.

00:16:37,253 --> 00:16:39,153
Ok, he's here.

330
00:16:39,221 --> 00:16:42,423
Don't be nervous.
Just be your normal
loving self.

331
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:45,693

332
00:16:48,097 --> 00:16:49,998
Birthday candles.

333
00:17:06,315 --> 00:17:08,783
Did tanner give you
a hard time today?

334
00:17:08,851 --> 00:17:10,718
Well, he let me
on the team,

335
00:17:10,786 --> 00:17:13,087
So I must have done
something right.

336
00:17:13,155 --> 00:17:14,355
[chuckles]

337
00:17:14,423 --> 00:17:15,923
Bonnie, you should have
seen stefan today.

338
00:17:15,991 --> 00:17:17,458
Tyler threw a ball
right at him, and--

339
00:17:17,526 --> 00:17:18,993
Yeah, I heard.

340
00:17:25,301 --> 00:17:28,803
Why don't you tell stefan
about your family?

341
00:17:28,871 --> 00:17:32,273
Um, divorced. No mom.
Live with my dad.

342
00:17:32,341 --> 00:17:33,641
Hmm.

343
00:17:33,709 --> 00:17:35,677
No, about the witches.

344
00:17:35,744 --> 00:17:38,046
Bonnie's family
has a lineage of witches.

345
00:17:38,113 --> 00:17:39,447
It's really cool.

346
00:17:39,515 --> 00:17:40,848
Cool isn't
the word I'd use.

347
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:44,052
Well, it's certainly
interesting.

348
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:45,520
I'm not too versed,

349
00:17:45,587 --> 00:17:47,422
But I do know
that there's

350
00:17:47,489 --> 00:17:49,290
A history of celtic druids

351
00:17:49,358 --> 00:17:51,259
That migrated here
in the 1800s.

352
00:17:51,327 --> 00:17:52,927
My family came
by way of salem.

353
00:17:52,995 --> 00:17:54,062
Really?

354
00:17:54,129 --> 00:17:56,331
Salem witches?

355
00:17:56,398 --> 00:17:57,565
Yeah.
[chuckles]

356
00:17:57,633 --> 00:17:59,500
I would say
that's pretty cool.

357
00:17:59,568 --> 00:18:02,337
Really? Why?

358
00:18:02,404 --> 00:18:05,306
Salem witches
are heroic examples

359
00:18:05,374 --> 00:18:08,009
Of individualism

360
00:18:08,077 --> 00:18:09,744
And nonconformity.

361
00:18:11,013 --> 00:18:12,980
Yeah, they are.

362
00:18:13,048 --> 00:18:14,615

[doorbell rings]

364
00:18:17,152 --> 00:18:19,454
I wonder who that could be.

365
00:18:22,891 --> 00:18:24,192
Surprise!

366
00:18:24,259 --> 00:18:25,360
Bonnie said you were
doing dinner,

367
00:18:25,427 --> 00:18:26,627
So we brought dessert.

368
00:18:26,695 --> 00:18:29,831
Oh.
Hope you don't mind.

369
00:18:31,734 --> 00:18:33,468
What are you doing here?

370
00:18:33,535 --> 00:18:36,371
Waiting for elena
to invite me in.

371
00:18:36,438 --> 00:18:37,572
Oh, yeah, you can--
no, no, no.

372
00:18:37,639 --> 00:18:39,273
He can't, uh...

373
00:18:39,341 --> 00:18:41,609
He can't stay.

374
00:18:42,611 --> 00:18:44,879
Can you, damon?

375
00:18:46,382 --> 00:18:48,149
Get in here.

376
00:18:48,217 --> 00:18:50,985
We're just...Finishing up.

377
00:18:51,053 --> 00:18:53,054
It's fine.
Just come on in.

378
00:19:02,197 --> 00:19:04,832
You have a beautiful home,
elena.

379
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,868
Thank you.

380
00:19:11,269 --> 00:19:13,869
I cannot believe that mr. Tanner
let you on the team.

381
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,870
Tyler must be ***.

382
00:19:16,232 --> 00:19:17,766
But good for you.
Go for it.

383
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:20,368
That's what
I always tell him. You have to engage.

384
00:19:20,436 --> 00:19:22,437
You can't just sit there and wait
for life to come to you.

385
00:19:22,505 --> 00:19:23,538
You have to go get it.

386
00:19:23,606 --> 00:19:25,607
Yeah, elena wasn't
so lucky today.

387
00:19:25,675 --> 00:19:27,208
It's only because you missed
summer camp.

388
00:19:27,276 --> 00:19:29,044
God, I don't know how you're ever going
to learn the routines.

389
00:19:29,111 --> 00:19:31,446
I'll work with her.
She'll get it.

390
00:19:31,514 --> 00:19:32,881
I guess we can
put her in the back.

391
00:19:32,948 --> 00:19:35,850
You know,
you don't seem like

392
00:19:35,918 --> 00:19:37,519
The cheerleader type,
elena.

393
00:19:37,586 --> 00:19:39,521
Oh, it's just 'cause
her parents died.

394
00:19:39,588 --> 00:19:40,955
Yeah, I mean,
she's just

395
00:19:41,023 --> 00:19:42,624
Totally
going through
a blah phase.

396
00:19:42,692 --> 00:19:46,695
She used to be
way more fun.

397
00:19:46,762 --> 00:19:50,498
And I say that
with complete
sensitivity.

398
00:19:50,566 --> 00:19:52,467
I'm sorry, elena.

399
00:19:52,535 --> 00:19:54,903
I know what
it's like to lose
both your parents.

400
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:57,772
In fact, stefan and I
have watched almost
every single person

401
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,574
We've ever
cared about die.

402
00:19:59,642 --> 00:20:01,743
We don't need to get into
that right now, damon.

403
00:20:01,811 --> 00:20:04,145
Oh, you know what,
you're right, stef.
I'm sorry.

404
00:20:04,213 --> 00:20:07,282
The last thing I wanted
to do was bring her up.

405
00:20:11,654 --> 00:20:13,088
Mmm.

406
00:20:13,155 --> 00:20:14,589
Don't do that.

407
00:20:14,657 --> 00:20:16,524
Not while
I'm working.

408
00:20:16,592 --> 00:20:19,828
[music playing,
indistinct chatter]

409
00:20:19,895 --> 00:20:21,096
I'll see you later.

410
00:20:21,163 --> 00:20:22,897
I'll be right back.

411
00:20:30,339 --> 00:20:33,174
She's my sister
and I love her,

412
00:20:33,242 --> 00:20:36,878
But sometimes she can
really make you work for it.

413
00:20:36,946 --> 00:20:39,714
I find it pretty easy.

414
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:50,625
All right, I get it.
Hitting me to impress
her. That's--

415
00:20:50,693 --> 00:20:51,659
That's real nice.

416
00:20:51,727 --> 00:20:53,928
I don't need to impress her.

417
00:20:53,996 --> 00:20:55,964
I already won.

418
00:20:57,233 --> 00:20:59,467
Now you're dead.
Am I? 'cause it seems like

419
00:20:59,535 --> 00:21:01,536
I'm standing here
waiting for you to man up.

Ty, don't!

The next time I see you,
gilbert...

422
00:21:05,641 --> 00:21:07,108
No, next time I see you.

423
00:21:13,282 --> 00:21:14,716
What are you doin', vick?

424
00:21:17,253 --> 00:21:18,787
One more.

425
00:21:18,854 --> 00:21:21,589
Oh, thank you.

Nice save.

428
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:28,163
[chuckles]
I like you.

429
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:30,098
You know how to laugh.

430
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:31,199
And you make
stefan smile,

431
00:21:31,267 --> 00:21:32,067
Which is something
I haven't seen

432
00:21:32,135 --> 00:21:33,550
In a very long time.

433
00:21:36,573 --> 00:21:39,408
Earlier, did you mean...
Katherine?

434
00:21:39,476 --> 00:21:41,443
Mm-hmm.

435
00:21:42,361 --> 00:21:44,329
How did she die?

436
00:21:45,364 --> 00:21:47,999
In a fire.
Tragic fire.

437
00:21:48,067 --> 00:21:49,334
Recently?

438
00:21:49,402 --> 00:21:52,170
Well, it seems
like it was yesterday.

439
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:56,708
What was she like?

440
00:21:58,911 --> 00:22:00,545
She was beautiful.

441
00:22:00,613 --> 00:22:02,480
A lot like you
in that department.

442
00:22:02,548 --> 00:22:05,350
She was just
very complicated

443
00:22:05,418 --> 00:22:07,352
And selfish and at times
not very kind,

444
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,820
But very sexy
and seductive.

445
00:22:08,888 --> 00:22:13,058
So which one of you
dated her first?

447
00:22:16,195 --> 00:22:18,830
Nicely deduced.

Ask stefan.

449
00:22:20,633 --> 00:22:22,901
I'm sure his answer
differs from mine.

450
00:22:32,344 --> 00:22:34,946
I'd quit cheerleading
if I were you.

451
00:22:35,014 --> 00:22:36,648
Why do you say that?

452
00:22:36,716 --> 00:22:39,651
Oh, I saw you at practice.
You looked miserable.

453
00:22:39,719 --> 00:22:40,852
You saw that?

454
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,153
Uh-huh.

455
00:22:42,221 --> 00:22:45,457
I used to love it.
It was fun.

456
00:22:45,524 --> 00:22:47,392
Things are different
this year.

457
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,227
Everything that used
to matter doesn't anymore.

458
00:22:49,295 --> 00:22:50,361
So don't let it.

459
00:22:50,429 --> 00:22:51,830
Quit, move on.
Problem solved.

462
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,201
Some things
could matter again.

463
00:22:56,268 --> 00:22:57,736
Maybe.

464
00:22:57,803 --> 00:23:02,307
But...Seems a little
unrealistic to me.

I'm sorry.

About katherine.

467
00:23:14,987 --> 00:23:16,955
You lost her, too.

Sure, why not?

Matt tries, but he's just
having a really hard time.

473
00:23:30,169 --> 00:23:32,170
You have to
understand that

474
00:23:32,238 --> 00:23:33,471
They were
each other's first.

475

You know, like,
from the sandbox.

476
00:23:39,478 --> 00:23:41,579
That's a really nice scarf.

477
00:23:41,647 --> 00:23:43,481
Mm. Thank you,
it's new.

478
00:23:43,549 --> 00:23:44,549
Can I see it?

479
00:23:44,617 --> 00:23:48,019
I mean, would you mind
taking it off?

480
00:23:48,087 --> 00:23:49,387
Oh, I can't.

481
00:23:49,455 --> 00:23:52,457
Why not? You ok?

482
00:23:53,425 --> 00:23:54,759
Um...

483
00:23:54,827 --> 00:23:58,129
All I know is that
I can't take it off.

you two kids
talking about?

on her scarf.

you go see
if you can help?

I do dishes?

For me?

492
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:17,315
Hmm...I don't think so.

493
00:24:22,221 --> 00:24:25,457
Go see if elena
needs help
in the kitchen.

494
00:24:25,524 --> 00:24:27,192
You know what?

495
00:24:27,259 --> 00:24:29,727
I'm gonna go see
if elena needs some
help in the kitchen.

496
00:24:29,795 --> 00:24:32,297
Great.

497
00:24:40,673 --> 00:24:42,040
They are people, damon.

498
00:24:42,107 --> 00:24:43,541
She's not a puppet.

499
00:24:43,609 --> 00:24:45,176
She doesn't exist
for your amusement,

500
00:24:45,244 --> 00:24:46,911
For you to feed on
whenever you want to.

501
00:24:46,979 --> 00:24:48,313
Sure she does.

502
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,347
They all do.

503
00:24:49,415 --> 00:24:51,015
They're whatever
I want them to be.

504
00:24:51,083 --> 00:24:52,617
They're mine
for the taking.

505
00:24:52,685 --> 00:24:54,118
All right,
you've had your fun.

506
00:24:54,186 --> 00:24:56,054
You used caroline,
you got to me and elena,

507
00:24:56,121 --> 00:24:57,188
Good for you.

508
00:24:57,256 --> 00:24:58,823
Now it's time
for you to go.

509
00:24:58,891 --> 00:25:01,526
That's not a problem.

510
00:25:01,594 --> 00:25:03,595
Because...

511
00:25:03,662 --> 00:25:05,263
I've been invited in,

512
00:25:05,331 --> 00:25:06,865
And I'll come back
tomorrow night

513
00:25:06,932 --> 00:25:08,166
And the following night

514
00:25:08,234 --> 00:25:11,669
And I'll do
with your little
cheerleader

515
00:25:11,737 --> 00:25:14,038
Whatever I want to do.

516
00:25:14,106 --> 00:25:17,575
Because that is
what is normal to me.

Tonight wasn't
so bad. I had fun.

520
00:25:25,918 --> 00:25:27,585
Hmm. That makes one of us.

521
00:25:27,653 --> 00:25:29,521
[chuckles]
come on.

522
00:25:29,588 --> 00:25:32,590
Your brother isn't
as bad as you make
him out to be...

There must be a shred of humanity
left inside my brother.

527
00:27:03,402 --> 00:27:05,736
Somewhere.

528
00:27:05,804 --> 00:27:07,638
I keep hoping.

529
00:27:07,706 --> 00:27:10,374
But how do I
make him see it?

530
00:27:10,442 --> 00:27:12,443
And how do I
protect her?

Ooh.

00:27:49,414 --> 00:27:51,315
Look at you.
You look hot in your jersey.

535
00:27:51,383 --> 00:27:53,217
What happened?
No more cheerleader?

536
00:27:53,285 --> 00:27:55,085
I quit.
I'm a quitter.

00:27:55,153 --> 00:27:57,788
No, hey,
you're not a quitter.

538
00:27:57,856 --> 00:27:59,857
You suffered a great loss.
You're not the same person.

539
00:27:59,925 --> 00:28:02,860
You should be
looking ahead.

540
00:28:02,928 --> 00:28:04,094
You should be
starting over.

541
00:28:04,162 --> 00:28:06,330
Ok?

542
00:28:07,332 --> 00:28:09,567
I hope you don't think
this is

543
00:28:09,634 --> 00:28:13,070
Too soon
or too weird, but...

544

I, uh,

I wanted you
to have this.

Oh, my god,
it's beautiful.

It's something
that I've had forever,

548
00:28:26,318 --> 00:28:29,854
And, uh, I've never
wanted to give it
to anyone until now.

549
00:28:29,921 --> 00:28:34,291
I'd very much like it
if you'd wear it for me,

For...Good luck.

00:28:38,296 --> 00:28:39,864

that I smell?

No, it's, uh--
it's an herb.

And, uh,

I wanted
to thank you

00:28:52,244 --> 00:28:56,947
For pushing me
to try out for the team.

really good.

We'll figure it out.

And you're not
in uniform because...

Wait. Let's be
honest here.

00:29:57,575 --> 00:30:00,878
In the past, we used
to let other teams

Come into our town
and roll right over us!

And I'm gonna tell you
right now,

It has been
a long time

578
00:30:18,463 --> 00:30:20,998
Since I have seen
a kid like this

He just got here.

To put a check
in the win column,

I have only one thing
to say to you--

are hungry.

No, no, no,
it's fine.

Is it deep?
How bad is it?

Come on!

619
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:00,864
But...I saw it,
it was--

620
00:32:00,932 --> 00:32:02,232
He missed.

621
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,201
It's not my blood.

No, no, no.

I--I saw it. The glass
cut your hand. It was--

It's almost kick-off time,
all right?

00:32:13,178 --> 00:32:14,144
So, um,

627
00:32:14,212 --> 00:32:16,947
I'll, uh, I'll see
you after the game.

628
00:32:24,384 --> 00:32:25,417
Hey, tiki,
it's all wobbly.

629
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:26,785
Can you stand straight,
please?

630
00:32:26,853 --> 00:32:28,253
Could someone
please help tiki?

631
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:30,155
Hey! Where you been?

632
00:32:30,222 --> 00:32:31,423
Can I ask you a question

633
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:34,592
And you give me
a really serious
no-joke response?

634
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:35,860
Of course.
What is it?

635
00:32:35,928 --> 00:32:37,062
The bad mojo.

636
00:32:37,129 --> 00:32:39,364
When you touched stefan
and you had that reaction...

637
00:32:39,432 --> 00:32:41,232
You know what,
forget I said that.

638
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,201
Your little dinner
party plot totally won me over.

639
00:32:43,269 --> 00:32:44,669
No, bonnie, seriously.
What was it?

640
00:32:44,737 --> 00:32:46,538
Did you see something,

641
00:32:46,605 --> 00:32:48,273
Or...

642
00:32:49,208 --> 00:32:51,242
It wasn't clear
like a picture.

643
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:53,645
Like today,
I keep seeing

644
00:32:53,713 --> 00:32:54,779
Those same numbers
I told you about--

00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:57,282
8, 14, 22.

00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,817
Yeah?
When I touched stefan,

647
00:32:58,884 --> 00:33:00,285
It was a feeling.

648
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:04,823
And it vibrated through me,
and it was cold, and it--

649
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:06,791
And what?

650
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:08,960
It was death.

651
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:12,630
It's what I imagine
death to be like.

652
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:28,180
[gasps] you scared me.
What are you doing here?

00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,950
[whispering]
and why is that?

655
00:33:32,018 --> 00:33:33,985
I needed a break.

656
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:35,520
She talks more
than I can listen.

657
00:33:35,588 --> 00:33:37,622
That could be
a sign.

658
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:39,724
Well, she's awfully young.

659
00:33:39,792 --> 00:33:41,626
Not much younger
than you are.

660
00:33:41,694 --> 00:33:43,161
[chuckles]

661
00:33:44,229 --> 00:33:46,730
I don't see it going anywhere
in the bigger picture.

662
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:47,732
I think
she'd drive me crazy.

663
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,434
Caroline does have

664
00:33:49,502 --> 00:33:50,702
Some really
annoying traits,

665
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:52,237
But we've been
friends since the first grade

666
00:33:52,305 --> 00:33:53,939
And that means
something to me.

667
00:33:54,006 --> 00:33:56,975
Duly noted. I'm sorry
if I make you uncomfortable.

668
00:33:57,043 --> 00:33:59,110
That's not my intention.

669
00:33:59,178 --> 00:34:01,046
Yes, it is.

670
00:34:01,113 --> 00:34:04,449
Otherwise you wouldn't
put an alternate meaning

671
00:34:04,517 --> 00:34:06,651
Behind
everything you say.

672
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:11,089
You're right.

673
00:34:11,157 --> 00:34:13,925
I do have other intentions,
but so do you.

674
00:34:13,993 --> 00:34:16,061
Really?
Mm-hmm.

675
00:34:16,128 --> 00:34:19,431
I see 'em.

676
00:34:19,498 --> 00:34:20,765
You want me.

677
00:34:20,833 --> 00:34:22,067
Excuse me?

678
00:34:22,134 --> 00:34:24,769
I get to you.
You find yourself
drawn to me.

679
00:34:24,837 --> 00:34:26,605
You think about me
even when you don't
want to think about me.

680
00:34:26,672 --> 00:34:28,540
I bet you even
dreamed about me.

681
00:34:30,576 --> 00:34:31,910
And right now...

682
00:34:31,978 --> 00:34:34,913
You want to kiss me.

683
00:34:41,554 --> 00:34:43,021
What the hell?

684
00:34:43,089 --> 00:34:45,991
I don't know what game
you're trying to play
with stefan here,

685
00:34:46,058 --> 00:34:48,026
But I don't want
to be part of it.

686
00:34:48,094 --> 00:34:49,527
And I don't know what
happened in the past,

687
00:34:49,595 --> 00:34:51,663
But let's get
one thing straight--

688
00:34:51,731 --> 00:34:54,366
I am not katherine.

689
00:35:02,041 --> 00:35:03,475
You gonna be able to play?

690
00:35:03,542 --> 00:35:06,077
Oh, yeah,
I'm good.

691
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:08,647
Uh, what you did back there...

692
00:35:09,615 --> 00:35:11,316
You had jeremy's back.

693
00:35:11,384 --> 00:35:13,051
Ah, he's
a messed-up kid.

694
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:15,387
Somebody's gotta
look out for him.

695
00:35:15,454 --> 00:35:16,621
I know.

696
00:35:16,689 --> 00:35:19,824
This week at practice
I was a dick.

697
00:35:19,892 --> 00:35:21,259
Had your reasons.

698
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:23,261
No excuse.

699
00:35:27,466 --> 00:35:29,434
Good luck tonight.

700
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:31,169
We're lucky to have you.

701

Stefan joins a team,
makes a friend.

704

It's all so, "rah,
rah, go team, yeah!"

705
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:48,186
Not tonight.

706
00:35:48,254 --> 00:35:49,621
I'm done with you.

707
00:35:51,257 --> 00:35:53,458
Nice trick with elena.

708
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:56,027
Let me guess--
vervain in the necklace?

709
00:35:56,095 --> 00:35:58,463
I admit, I was
a bit surprised.

710
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:01,766
It's been a while
since anyone could
resist my compulsion.

711
00:36:02,902 --> 00:36:04,202
Where'd you get it?

712
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:06,137
Does it matter?

713
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:07,872
Guess I could
just seduce her
the old-fashioned way.

714
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:10,575
Or I could just...
Eat her.

715
00:36:14,013 --> 00:36:15,413
No.

716
00:36:15,481 --> 00:36:17,982
You're not gonna
hurt her, damon.

717
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:19,818
No?

718
00:36:19,885 --> 00:36:21,619
Because deep down inside,

719
00:36:21,687 --> 00:36:23,488
There is a part of you

720
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:24,823
That feels for her.

721
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:27,759
I was worried
that you had no humanity

722
00:36:27,827 --> 00:36:29,728
Left inside of you,

723
00:36:29,795 --> 00:36:32,597
That you may have actually
become the monster

724
00:36:32,665 --> 00:36:34,265
That you pretend to be.

725
00:36:34,333 --> 00:36:36,201
Who's pretending?
Then kill me.

726
00:36:36,268 --> 00:36:39,037
Well, I'm--
I'm tempted.

727
00:36:39,105 --> 00:36:40,805
No, you're not.

728
00:36:40,873 --> 00:36:41,973
You've had lifetimes
to do it,

729
00:36:42,041 --> 00:36:44,509
And yet, here I am.
I'm still alive.

730
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:46,311
And there you are.

731
00:36:46,379 --> 00:36:48,980
You're still haunting me.

732
00:36:49,048 --> 00:36:52,851
After 145 years.

733
00:36:52,918 --> 00:36:55,253
Katherine is dead.

734
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:57,589
And you hate me

735
00:36:57,656 --> 00:36:59,657
Because you loved her,

736
00:36:59,725 --> 00:37:02,994
And you torture me
because you still do.

737
00:37:03,062 --> 00:37:06,965
And that, my brother,

738
00:37:07,032 --> 00:37:09,367
Is your humanity.

We've got a game to play!

If that's
my humanity...

742

Then what's this?

743

I mean, what was that
about tonight?

What's beating up
the new guy going to prove?

Or screwing with my sister

Or pummeling
