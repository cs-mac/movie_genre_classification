00:00:09,569 --> 00:00:13,180
But my friend Olivia
has bigger dreams.

4
00:00:13,181 --> 00:00:16,141
Olivia majored in journalism
back when people

5
00:00:16,142 --> 00:00:19,102
gave a crap
about newspapers.

6
00:00:19,103 --> 00:00:22,398
Today's headline... tiny
Korean chick rejected again,

friend offers
sincere support.

8
00:00:25,052 --> 00:00:27,069
I should just give up.

9
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,278
You really should.

10
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:29,863
Hey, Olivia, I can
cheer you up.

11
00:00:29,864 --> 00:00:32,375
Remember that baby
bird I rescued?

12
00:00:32,376 --> 00:00:33,776
I named him Lancelot.

13
00:00:33,777 --> 00:00:35,511
Look what
I taught him to do.

Dee Dee, if some old lady tries
to give you an apple,

16
00:00:44,371 --> 00:00:45,587
you turn that bitch down.

17
00:00:45,588 --> 00:00:48,641
It took me 3 weeks to
nurse him back to health.

18
00:00:48,642 --> 00:00:50,242
Now he thinks
I'm his mommy.

19
00:00:50,243 --> 00:00:52,244
Can you say, "mommy"?

20
00:00:52,245 --> 00:00:56,598
Say, "mommy, mommy,
mommy, mama."

hey, did you guys hear
about the Hooters

26
00:01:19,695 --> 00:01:21,999
that's opening
down route 10?

Hooters?
Mm-hmm.

Please.

29
00:01:24,476 --> 00:01:27,368
I'm gonna open
a bar called wieners.

30
00:01:27,369 --> 00:01:30,037
And all the waiters would
have to wear a speedo

31
00:01:30,038 --> 00:01:33,925
with just the tip of their wiener
sticking out of the top.

Nobody wants
to see penis cleavage.

33
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:40,642
Especially
at my eye level.

34
00:01:40,643 --> 00:01:42,352
Look, guys,
the bottom line is

35
00:01:42,353 --> 00:01:43,721
we have to
compete with Hooters.

36
00:01:43,722 --> 00:01:45,106
So Jerry and I were
talking and I came up

37
00:01:45,107 --> 00:01:50,328
with a little idea for the uniforms
that he thought was brilliant.

38
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:53,447
You're going to look
great in that, Rick.

39
00:01:53,448 --> 00:01:57,568
Look, I know you think that these
objectify women and they do,

40
00:01:57,569 --> 00:02:01,496
but that's our business
plan, so just go for it.

41
00:02:02,941 --> 00:02:03,941
What makes this worse

42
00:02:03,942 --> 00:02:05,994
is that my cousins in
Korea probably made this.

43
00:02:05,995 --> 00:02:07,419
Yeah.

44
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,946
I am buying this for you

45
00:02:08,947 --> 00:02:10,965
because it took me
so long to get them.

46
00:02:10,966 --> 00:02:12,016
Oh, thank you.

47
00:02:12,017 --> 00:02:13,718
Hey, I couldn't help but
overhear your conversation

48
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:17,522
about your new uniforms and I can
understand why you don't like them.

49
00:02:17,523 --> 00:02:21,092
But from a marketing point
of view, they make sense.

No, but my roommate is and
she majored in journalism.

Ooh, that's rough.

60

No, but she's really smart.

61
00:02:41,512 --> 00:02:43,246
And she's Asian,
so Chung will have

I'd be happy
to get her an interview

if you'd let me

Wow. That is
an unethical proposal.

Why don't you
just eat something?

I was reading online

00:03:13,878 --> 00:03:15,061
that it seems
like a-face

to find some way

to live in harmony
with Lancelot.

That thing lived?

79
00:03:25,189 --> 00:03:27,824
Yes, but he's going to
have major trust issues.

80
00:03:27,825 --> 00:03:31,561
And I don't think he's going
to be able to have kids.

Chelsea, thank you so much
for getting me this interview.

I just hope you
find a job you love.

I love working
at the flower shop.

00:03:42,957 --> 00:03:45,241
I love the smell.
I love my smock.

86

I don't even mind that I'm
cold and wet all the time.

87
00:03:48,245 --> 00:03:51,414
I just pretend I'm working
in a dog's nose.

88

Dee Dee, if you ever
decide to drop acid,

89
00:03:53,818 --> 00:03:56,085
please make sure I'm there.

00:03:56,652 --> 00:03:57,587
You know what?

91
00:03:57,588 --> 00:03:59,940
I haven't had a prospect
this promising in 2 years.

92
00:03:59,941 --> 00:04:00,891
I'm so nervous.

93

the interview is always

94
00:04:02,627 --> 00:04:05,095
the most important part.
We should practice.

and I will be hr people.

Now, miss pack, out of all
the qualified applicants,

100
00:04:18,075 --> 00:04:21,478
what makes you think we should
hire you as assistant copywriter?

101
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:23,079
Mrs. Wiggenbottom,
may I interrupt?

102
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,164
Oh, yes, of course you may.

friends dating Tim Cornick?

Yes.
You've got the job.

105
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,389
That's not how it works.

106
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:36,259
I mean, is that you got your
job, Mrs. take-it-in-the bottom?

Chelsea: That night I
went out with Tim Cornick.

110
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:47,170
Because I was doing
this to help Olivia,

111
00:04:47,171 --> 00:04:48,688
I really turned
on the charm.

112
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:53,543
I just have to warn you, I am
a world class armpit farter.

113
00:04:54,362 --> 00:04:55,612
I was the youngest of 5 kids,

114
00:04:55,613 --> 00:04:57,697
so I was always
looking for attention.

115
00:04:57,698 --> 00:04:58,949
I was a ham, too.

116
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,651
Do you want me to burp
the alphabet for you?

a sparkling water, asap.

Do you know how she did?

120
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:11,094
She sailed through
the first round.

121
00:05:11,095 --> 00:05:12,103
Flying colors.

122
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:13,426
First round?

123
00:05:13,427 --> 00:05:14,664
Yeah, these jobs
are so competitive.

124
00:05:14,665 --> 00:05:16,633
There's a whole
series of interviews.

125
00:05:16,634 --> 00:05:18,568
You know, she has to go
through the process.

126
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:20,987
But, don't worry,
I've got her back.

127
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:22,864
Ok.

128
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:27,077
Ahem.

129

Is that...

130
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,288
What?

131
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:31,831
Listen.

132
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,541
What is it?

133
00:05:34,652 --> 00:05:36,903
It's butterfly kisses.

134
00:05:36,904 --> 00:05:38,054
Oh.

135
00:05:38,055 --> 00:05:42,409
It's about a father who
puts his daughter to bed

136
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:45,328
and gives her
butterfly kisses...

137
00:05:45,329 --> 00:05:46,463
With his eyelashes.

138
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:52,469
And the last verse is
the girl's wedding day

139
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:57,073
and the mom is putting
baby's breath in her hair.

140
00:05:57,074 --> 00:06:02,662
And her dad is giving
her butterfly kisses.

141
00:06:02,663 --> 00:06:08,001
You know, and he's just like this
big... he's like a big clunky guy.

142
00:06:08,002 --> 00:06:12,055
And he loves his
daughter so much.

143
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,791
You know, it's...

144
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:15,959
Do you have a daughter?

145
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,088
Oh, no. I just... I love
the idea of it.

[No audio]

147
00:06:43,652 --> 00:06:46,573
I don't understand
what's going on here.

148
00:06:46,574 --> 00:06:48,057
Shh!

149
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:50,443
Are you kidding me?

150
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:52,787
Listen to the words.

151
00:06:56,367 --> 00:06:58,535
Oh, God, my phone
is vibrating.

152

Who knows why
it isn't lighting up?

153
00:07:01,956 --> 00:07:03,173
You know, it's work.

154
00:07:03,174 --> 00:07:05,759
I have to take this. Hello?

Oh, my God!

156

Well, I'm on
a really fun date,

157
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:15,418
but I guess
I'll come right in.

158
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:16,269
What is it?

159
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,221
One of my fellow
cocktail waitresses,

a car accident.

Oh. Is she ok?

162
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,236
No, she died!

163
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,115
I have to go cover for her.

164
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:32,494
I know that if I died,
she would cover for me.

165
00:07:33,454 --> 00:07:34,320
I mean, she would have.

166
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:35,989
Obviously, you know,
she can't now but...

167
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,373
Thank you
so much for dinner.

168
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:38,274
I gotta go.

169
00:07:38,275 --> 00:07:39,159
That's awful.

170
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,327
Let me pay and I'll
drive you over there.

171
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:42,662
In a car?

172
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:45,615
Too soon.

173
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:50,720
Hey, what are
you doing here?

174
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:52,505
I thought you were on
your date with Tim Cornick.

175
00:07:52,506 --> 00:07:55,341
Girl, you know I would
do anything for you.

176
00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:57,185
I will give you
a bikini wax

177
00:07:57,595 --> 00:07:59,312
when you're
low on funds,

178
00:07:59,764 --> 00:08:01,397
but I will
not date a cry baby.

179
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:04,150
Did you do
something scary in bed?

180
00:08:05,336 --> 00:08:07,003
No, we were at dinner.

181
00:08:07,004 --> 00:08:08,037
He heard a country song.

182
00:08:08,038 --> 00:08:10,106
Oh, well, then he was
probably just trying

183
00:08:10,107 --> 00:08:12,358
to seem sensitive
to get you into bed.

184
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:14,344
He didn't know
he could just ask.

185
00:08:14,345 --> 00:08:15,410
Ha ha.

186
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:17,914
No, he's like a really
sensitive guy.

187
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:20,817
I think he was
menstruating.

188
00:08:20,818 --> 00:08:22,986
Chels, listen, most
girls would love a guy

189
00:08:22,987 --> 00:08:25,588
who's emotionally
available enough to cry.

190
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:26,706
You're more like a dude.

191
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:27,874
Yeah, if that means
I don't lose it

192
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,994
in front of people, then, yeah,
I guess I'm like a dude.

193
00:08:30,995 --> 00:08:33,763
And your deep voice
scares my mother.

194
00:08:34,374 --> 00:08:35,398
Thanks.

195
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:37,267
Well, it doesn't
matter anyways.

196
00:08:37,268 --> 00:08:39,636
Come on, you've got to keep
dating Tim Cornick.

197
00:08:39,637 --> 00:08:40,436
I need this job.

198
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:41,888
I need to pay off
my student loans.

199
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:44,899
I need to not be wearing
footballs on my boobs.

200
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,144
Baseballs are still available.

201
00:08:48,145 --> 00:08:50,363
Hey, Rick, have you
checked your email lately?

202
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:51,281
No. Why?
What's up?

203
00:08:51,282 --> 00:08:53,783
Jerry wants us to wear
new uniforms, too.

204
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:55,251
What?
What are they?

205
00:08:55,252 --> 00:08:56,386
I don't know.

206
00:08:56,387 --> 00:08:57,854
You know, I really hope we
don't have to wear suspenders.

207
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:02,667
It's like wearing a sign that
says, "pick me up, drunk man."

208
00:09:03,761 --> 00:09:05,562
I wonder what
the new uniforms are.

209
00:09:05,563 --> 00:09:09,098
I wonder why Jerry would leave
his BlackBerry on the bar.

210
00:09:09,099 --> 00:09:10,166
You sent the email?

211
00:09:10,167 --> 00:09:13,036
Yeah. Wait till you
see these uniforms.

212
00:09:13,037 --> 00:09:17,140
Unlike your education, some
things are worth the money.

213
00:09:18,008 --> 00:09:19,392
Oh, no, it's Tim Cornick.

214
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:20,727
He can't see me
like this.

215
00:09:20,728 --> 00:09:24,022
Ok. Go. But for God's sakes,
keep the music upbeat.

216
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:26,249
Hey, don't ask.

217
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:30,019
Chelsea, I hope I didn't do
anything to turn you off.

218
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,854
I'm kind of an emotional guy.

219
00:09:31,855 --> 00:09:35,158
You're not like most marketing
executives, are you, Tim?

220
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:36,960
Well, I'm the creative one.

221
00:09:36,961 --> 00:09:38,661
My partner handles
the business stuff.

222
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:41,289
You know? I do the heart.
He does the head.

223
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,298
Oh.

224
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:44,667
What's his number?

225
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:49,539
Hey, by the way, I am so
sorry about your friend.

226
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:53,142
But everyone seems to be doing ok.

227
00:09:53,592 --> 00:09:54,878
Oh, missy.

228
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:56,646
She didn't actually die.

229
00:09:56,647 --> 00:09:58,982
She just lost a foot.

230
00:09:58,983 --> 00:09:59,883
Oh, really?

231
00:09:59,884 --> 00:10:01,476
That's still sad and
everyone seems upbeat.

232
00:10:01,477 --> 00:10:04,687
No, well, people saw her making
fun of other people with one foot,

233
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:07,148
so everyone thought
she kind of deserved it.

234
00:10:08,158 --> 00:10:10,410
Wow, karma.

235
00:10:10,411 --> 00:10:11,227
Yeah.

236
00:10:11,228 --> 00:10:12,428
You know that song
"karma chameleon"?

237
00:10:12,429 --> 00:10:14,781
By heart, don't need a reminder.

238
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,250
Ok.

239
00:10:17,251 --> 00:10:20,453
But when do I get to
take you out again?

240
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:22,956
Please?

241
00:10:22,957 --> 00:10:24,407
Tomorrow night.

242
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:25,675
Great.

243
00:10:25,676 --> 00:10:29,420
How about one butterfly
kiss for the road?

244
00:10:31,348 --> 00:10:33,116
Ok.

245
00:10:43,025 --> 00:10:45,191
Chelsea: While Olivia's
interview process was grueling.

246
00:10:45,192 --> 00:10:46,968
She was trying her
best to stand out.

247
00:10:46,969 --> 00:10:48,106
[Grunting]

248
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,189
- Aah!
- Ha ha ha!

249
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:54,153
And I tried my hardest
not to put out.

250
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:58,646
Since I was forced to be with him,

251
00:10:58,647 --> 00:11:00,565
I actually started
to feel for the guy.

252
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,201
His raw emotion made me feel
protective toward him,

253
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,937
as Dee Dee was toward the
now half-eaten Lancelot.

254
00:11:05,938 --> 00:11:11,409
Or maybe it was just the 6 shots
of vodka before the main course.

255
00:11:14,329 --> 00:11:16,514
Hit me again.

256
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:22,870
Chelsea, I feel like we're
becoming best friends,

257
00:11:22,871 --> 00:11:24,517
but you're not that into me.

258
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:27,525
Oh, believe me, Tim,
we are not best friends.

259
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:31,829
But we're not lovers either
and I don't blame you.

260
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:35,199
Nobody wants to make love with me.

261
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,571
Mmm.

262
00:11:36,968 --> 00:11:39,036
I have sleep apnea.

263
00:11:39,037 --> 00:11:41,826
You know?
I'm allergic to everything.

264
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:45,376
The last woman I was with,
right in the middle of our intimacy

265
00:11:45,377 --> 00:11:47,123
she said, "this is a mistake."

266
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,712
"You can finish,
but this is a mistake."

267
00:11:51,713 --> 00:11:53,130
No.

268
00:11:55,917 --> 00:11:59,010
So I finished, you know.

269
00:11:59,011 --> 00:12:00,922
I haven't been with anybody

270
00:12:00,923 --> 00:12:04,849
in 18 months and I am so lonely.

271
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:08,296
Tim, you are such a great guy.

272
00:12:08,852 --> 00:12:12,523
You know, any woman would
be lucky to be with you.

273
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:14,285
You don't want to be with me.

274
00:12:14,286 --> 00:12:16,361
Of course I do.

275
00:12:16,362 --> 00:12:18,206
You do?
Yeah.

276
00:12:18,207 --> 00:12:21,542
Oh, Chelsea, you have no
idea what that means to me.

277
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:24,612
Yeah, but... but...
But not tonight.

278
00:12:25,452 --> 00:12:28,382
Because I have
had so much to drink,

279
00:12:28,383 --> 00:12:33,954
I'm afraid that I won't
be able to get it open.

280
00:12:39,311 --> 00:12:44,181
I love that you
are sharing with me.

281
00:12:44,888 --> 00:12:47,934
Hey, can I get another shot?

282
00:12:50,606 --> 00:12:52,073
I don't know what to do, Dee Dee.

283
00:12:52,074 --> 00:12:55,876
If I were you, I'd get a job
where you wear a shirt.

284
00:12:56,645 --> 00:12:58,646
No, I'm talking about Tim Cornick.

285
00:12:59,027 --> 00:13:00,780
We're both having guy problems.

286
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:01,988
What?

287
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:04,818
Mr. Kitty.
He's a real handful.

288
00:13:04,819 --> 00:13:06,787
But we love them, right?

289
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:09,622
Chelsea, I've got good news!

290
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:12,093
- You got the job?
- Yes!

291
00:13:12,094 --> 00:13:14,762
I still have to pick up
shifts at the bar,

292
00:13:14,763 --> 00:13:15,880
but I get to work sitting down

293
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:18,297
and you get to break up
with Tim Cornick.

294
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:19,934
No, I can't.

295
00:13:19,935 --> 00:13:20,935
He was so sad last night

296
00:13:20,936 --> 00:13:23,052
that I got drunk and
promised to sleep with him.

297
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:25,206
- What?
- Yeah.

298
00:13:25,207 --> 00:13:26,207
And if I turn him down now,

299
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:27,441
it'll totally break his heart.

300
00:13:27,442 --> 00:13:30,311
But if you make love with him,
he's going to want to marry you.

301
00:13:30,642 --> 00:13:32,546
Well, if I do have sex with him,

302
00:13:32,547 --> 00:13:36,016
at least we can use
his tears as lubricant.

303
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,200
This is unacceptable.

304
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:47,361
So it objectifies you.

305
00:13:47,362 --> 00:13:49,764
This is our new business plan.

306
00:13:53,957 --> 00:13:56,937
This is why I quit footlocker.

307
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:02,510
Wow. Todd is really packing.

308
00:14:02,511 --> 00:14:03,311
Yeah.

309
00:14:03,312 --> 00:14:04,595
Yeah, the gods of proportion

310
00:14:04,596 --> 00:14:06,814
have such mixed feelings about him.

311
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:08,882
All right, you know
what? That's it.

312
00:14:08,883 --> 00:14:11,185
I'm calling Jerry and I
am telling him we're not

313
00:14:11,186 --> 00:14:12,977
going to wear these
uniforms anymore.

314
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:13,988
Yeah, neither are we.

315
00:14:13,989 --> 00:14:15,222
Yeah, I mean, what's
he going to do?

316
00:14:15,223 --> 00:14:16,090
Is he going to fire all of us?

317
00:14:16,091 --> 00:14:17,491
No. This is demeaning, it's wrong,

318
00:14:17,492 --> 00:14:19,160
and we're not going
to do it anymore.

319
00:14:19,161 --> 00:14:22,236
You go, girl.
Thanks.
