1
00:00:56,556 --> 00:01:01,870
<i>There is a lovely road that
runs from Ixopo into the hills.</i>

2
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,538
<i>These hills are
grass-covered and rolling,</i>

3
00:01:04,539 --> 00:01:08,354
<i>and they are lovely
beyond any singing of it.</i>

4
00:01:08,355 --> 00:01:12,294
<i>The road climbs 7 miles
into them, to Carisbrooke;</i>

5
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,940
<i>And from there,
if there is no mist,</i>

6
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:20,016
<i>you look down on one
of the fairest valleys in Africa.</i>

7
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:48,567
CRY, THE BELOVED COUNTRY

8
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,786
Umfundisi! (Reverend)

9
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,549
Umfundisi.

10
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,199
Umfundisi.

11
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,582
<i>Come in!</i>

12
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,810
Yes?

13
00:03:35,821 --> 00:03:38,551
I bring a letter, Umfundisi.

14
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,800
A letter?

15
00:03:46,675 --> 00:03:47,990
Thank you.

16
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,523
<i>Go well, my child.</i>

17
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,651
Are you hungry, small one?

18
00:04:02,686 --> 00:04:04,883
A little hungry, umfundisi.

19
00:04:05,344 --> 00:04:09,000
Go to the mother, then.
Perhaps she has some food.

20
00:04:09,423 --> 00:04:12,113
Thank you, umfundisi.

21
00:04:33,722 --> 00:04:35,240
<i>Stephen!</i>

22
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,200
Has the child gone yet?

23
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,499
She is still eating.

24
00:04:39,534 --> 00:04:41,127
Let her eat.

25
00:04:41,162 --> 00:04:43,540
She brought a letter.

26
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,600
It is from Johannesburg.

27
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,090
It is not from Absalom, our son.

28
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,203
<i>But perhaps it concerns him.</i>

29
00:05:00,204 --> 00:05:04,042
<i>Perhaps, perhaps,
perhaps it is from brother John.</i>

30
00:05:04,043 --> 00:05:06,622
<i>We wanted a letter from
Johannesburg,</i>

31
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,940
<i>but when it comes,</i>

32
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,190
we are afraid to open it.

33
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,890
Who is afraid?

34
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,793
Open it!

35
00:05:23,303 --> 00:05:23,963
Well?

36
00:05:23,964 --> 00:05:25,640
Is from the Mission House.

37
00:05:25,654 --> 00:05:28,536
<i>"Sophiatown, Johannesburg."</i>

38
00:05:28,571 --> 00:05:32,551
<i>26, September, 1946.</i>

39
00:05:33,085 --> 00:05:35,910
<i>My dear brother in Christ...</i>

40
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,443
<i>I had the experience
of meting a young woman</i>

41
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:41,598
<i>here in Johannesburg.</i>

42
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,017
<i>She is your sister,</i>

43
00:05:43,018 --> 00:05:45,837
<i>Gertrude Kumalo.</i>

44
00:05:46,188 --> 00:05:48,300
<i>She is very sick</i>

45
00:05:48,712 --> 00:05:53,545
<i>"and I ask you to come
quickly to Johannesburg."</i>

46
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,300
<i>This is a journey
I have always feared.</i>

47
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,940
<i>When my people have gone,</i>

48
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,615
<i>never to return,</i>

49
00:06:01,686 --> 00:06:03,742
<i>the young men have gone to the mines,</i>

50
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:06,272
<i>so the young women go to find them.</i>

51
00:06:06,314 --> 00:06:08,509
<i>For who can enjoy the lovely land</i>

52
00:06:08,679 --> 00:06:10,886
<i>and the sun that pours down
on the earth</i>

53
00:06:10,887 --> 00:06:13,869
<i>when white will note live
equally with the black</i>

54
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,503
<i>a land where the white man has evething</i>

55
00:06:16,638 --> 00:06:19,422
<i>and the black man nothing.</i>

56
00:06:24,403 --> 00:06:26,300
12.56 lbs.

57
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,200
Take it all, Stephen.

58
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,998
And the Post Office Book.

59
00:06:32,285 --> 00:06:34,921
<i>There is 10 pounds in it.</i>

60
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:37,855
<i>There mabe be doctors, hospitals,</i>

61
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,800
other troubles.

62
00:06:40,231 --> 00:06:41,664
<i>Please take it.</i>

63
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:45,155
<i>You'll need it.</i>

64
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,875
- They have blowed the last whistle, umfundisi.
- Yes.

65
00:07:13,876 --> 00:07:16,054
The train is near.

66
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,036
I want to ask a favor,
umfundisi.

67
00:07:21,766 --> 00:07:23,300
Ask the favor.

68
00:07:23,816 --> 00:07:25,350
You know Sibeko?

69
00:07:25,751 --> 00:07:27,104
Yes.

70
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:28,748
Well...

71
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:31,270
Sibeko's daughter worked
for this white man, uSmith.

72
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:34,668
<i>And when uSmith daughter married
and moved to Johannesburg...</i>

73
00:07:34,669 --> 00:07:38,143
Sibeko's daughter
went with them to work.

74
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,841
But Sibeko has heard no word
from her this past 10, 12 months.

75
00:07:47,244 --> 00:07:49,879
<i>This is the address of uSmith's daughter.</i>

76
00:07:50,467 --> 00:07:53,256
<i>Sibeko asks that you inquire.</i>

77
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,300
<i>Grandfather!</i>

78
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,972
My boy!

79
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,862
Hello!

80
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:29,466
<i>Lovely to see you both.
You're looking marvelous.</i>

81
00:08:29,535 --> 00:08:31,170
<i>And how is your husband?</i>

82
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:33,852
Your son is in good health.
Thank you.

83
00:08:35,042 --> 00:08:36,730
Is it true...

84
00:08:36,742 --> 00:08:39,400
that he opened a boy's club for blacks?

85
00:08:39,746 --> 00:08:41,241
Yes.

86
00:08:41,276 --> 00:08:44,300
The "Claremont African Boys Club".

87
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,290
<i>What's he want to do that for?</i>

88
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,500
<i>I just don't understand Arthur.</i>

89
00:08:49,577 --> 00:08:51,060
I guess

90
00:08:51,075 --> 00:08:53,850
I never will understand.

91
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,090
I wish he leave things as they are.

92
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,025
<i>I wish he face the reality.
He's a dreamer.</i>

93
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,161
Blacks have their place,
we have our place.

94
00:09:02,162 --> 00:09:04,740
Blacks live their lives,
we live our lives.

95
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:06,481
But, separately.

96
00:09:08,776 --> 00:09:09,800
<i>Do you know, Ian?</i>

97
00:09:10,063 --> 00:09:11,500
There is an old saying,

98
00:09:11,501 --> 00:09:13,750
that
"birds of a feather stick together".

99
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:15,840
Please!

100
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:18,100
We're here for a family holiday.

101
00:09:18,278 --> 00:09:19,710
Well...

102
00:09:19,713 --> 00:09:23,013
why isn't he here,
with his family...

103
00:09:23,048 --> 00:09:24,529
instead back there?

104
00:09:31,257 --> 00:09:32,800
Tell me, my friend:

105
00:09:32,801 --> 00:09:35,209
why did Sibeko
not come to me himself?

106
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:37,960
He was afraid, umfundisi.
He is not of our church.

107
00:09:37,961 --> 00:09:39,868
Is he not of our people?

108
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:43,246
Can a man in trouble...

109
00:09:43,247 --> 00:09:47,482
- go only to those of his church?
- I shall tell him, umfundisi.

110
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:48,890
Tell Sibeko...

111
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,340
I shall inquire about his daughter.
Stay well, my friend.

112
00:09:51,353 --> 00:09:53,240
Go well, umfundisi.

113
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,800
<i>Go well...</i>

114
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:10,590
Hey, look!

115
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,190
The mines!

116
00:11:12,194 --> 00:11:13,494
<i>Wake up!</i>

117
00:11:13,495 --> 00:11:15,670
<i>Is the mines!</i>

118
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,590
<i>Umfundisi...</i>

119
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,390
<i>the train does not stop here.</i>

120
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,790
<i>Is this got to Johannesburg?</i>

121
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,522
<i>No, no, no...</i>

122
00:11:31,773 --> 00:11:35,000
<i>Umfundisi, Johannesburg
still along way away.</i>

123
00:11:59,004 --> 00:12:01,160
<i>Welcome to Johannesburg Station.</i>

124
00:12:01,161 --> 00:12:04,322
<i>Passengers????? Name-checks in hand.</i>

125
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:06,861
<i>Johannesburg Station.</i>

126
00:12:14,595 --> 00:12:17,521
Now we are here, umfundisi:
Johannesburg!

127
00:13:04,858 --> 00:13:06,867
- Where will you going, father?
- Sophiatown.

128
00:13:06,868 --> 00:13:08,989
Aha, Sophiatown!

129
00:13:09,006 --> 00:13:11,801
Come with me
then I shall show you.

130
00:13:11,803 --> 00:13:14,561
Thank you. Thank you.

131
00:13:28,219 --> 00:13:30,367
You must stand in this line,
umfundisi.

132
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,924
Shall I get the ticket for you,
umfundisi?

133
00:13:36,925 --> 00:13:40,706
- For you not lose your place in the line.
- Ah, thank you. You're kindness.

134
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,400
Friend.

135
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,890
Friend.

136
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,041
Please, tell me,
where is the ticket office?

137
00:14:24,042 --> 00:14:26,789
- What ticket office, umfundisi?
- For the ticket!

138
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,426
For the bus!

139
00:14:28,488 --> 00:14:30,678
You get the ticket in the bus.

140
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,956
There is not ticket office here.

141
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:38,494
But... a young said...

142
00:14:39,658 --> 00:14:42,320
I gave him money for a ticket.

143
00:14:42,321 --> 00:14:45,548
You have been robbed, umfundisi.

144
00:14:45,897 --> 00:14:47,590
Where are you going to...

145
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,332
Sophiatown?

146
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,755
Yes.

147
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:52,816
The mission house.

148
00:14:54,487 --> 00:14:56,957
This way that the
little our bus is coming...

149
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,257
and then I'll take you there.

150
00:15:36,274 --> 00:15:38,240
<i>It's been a very long?????,
umfundisi.</i>

151
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:41,371
<i>And I tear
it's only the beginning.</i>

152
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,500
<i>Good evening, Rev. Msimangu.</i>

153
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:02,002
I bring a friend to you.
The Reverend Kumalo, from Ndotsheni.

154
00:16:05,654 --> 00:16:07,833
I am glad to greet you.

155
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,505
- Please come in, come in.
- Thank you.

156
00:16:14,368 --> 00:16:17,650
<i>Lord God, we thank you
for the food that has given us.</i>

157
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:20,000
We pray for those
who are not afortunate,

158
00:16:20,002 --> 00:16:23,605
and we pray for our brother,
Stephen Kumalo, our visitor,

159
00:16:23,804 --> 00:16:25,916
that he may do the hard work.

160
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:28,340
In Jesus Christ. Amen.

161
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,091
Amen.

162
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:34,924
I think our visitor
is in need of his bed.

163
00:16:37,576 --> 00:16:38,626
<i>Reverendo Msimangu,</i>

164
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,900
<i>would you show our visitor to his room?</i>

165
00:16:45,288 --> 00:16:47,551
This will be your room, umfundisi.

166
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,420
<i>Thank you, Ms. Lithebe.</i>

167
00:16:49,422 --> 00:16:51,196
<i>The father will only to sleep in here.</i>

168
00:16:51,197 --> 00:16:53,854
<i>He will take his meals
with us in the mission.</i>

169
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,386
<i>If does anything,
please, ask, umfundisi.</i>

170
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,890
<i>I thank you.</i>

171
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:03,194
- Sleep well, umfundisi.
- Sleep well, mother.

172
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,300
<i>You will pardon me if
I'm hasty, but</i>

173
00:17:05,322 --> 00:17:07,279
I am anxious to hear about my sister.

174
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,931
<i>Oh yes, yes,
I'm sure you're anxiously.</i>

175
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,190
But... tell me first:

176
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,166
why did she come to Johannesburg?

177
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:16,090
<i>To look for her husband.</i>

178
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,814
He was recruited for the mines

179
00:17:17,815 --> 00:17:20,015
but he did not write

180
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,947
and did not return.

181
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:24,406
She took her small child
and came to look for him.

182
00:17:26,018 --> 00:17:27,810
Is she very sick?

183
00:17:27,821 --> 00:17:29,900
<i>Yes, she is very sick.</i>

184
00:17:30,218 --> 00:17:33,015
But it is not that
kind of sickness.

185
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,140
She is a...

186
00:17:34,352 --> 00:17:35,110
prostitute.

187
00:17:35,129 --> 00:17:38,042
I do not know
if she ever found her husband,

188
00:17:38,158 --> 00:17:40,737
but she has no husband now.

189
00:17:40,823 --> 00:17:42,499
She is in Claremont.

190
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:46,533
It is the rubbish heap of the city.

191
00:17:48,643 --> 00:17:51,480
I have two other great sorrows.

192
00:17:51,716 --> 00:17:52,907
My son Absalom

193
00:17:52,908 --> 00:17:55,647
he came here also to look for my sister.

194
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:59,565
- But...
- We shall try to find him, my brother.

195
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,876
You are kind.

196
00:18:00,877 --> 00:18:02,527
I'm not kind.

197
00:18:02,837 --> 00:18:05,018
I'm a sinful and selfish man.

198
00:18:05,019 --> 00:18:08,516
But God put his hands on me,
that is all.

199
00:18:09,876 --> 00:18:12,245
You said two great sorrows.

200
00:18:12,246 --> 00:18:14,510
I have a brother also
here at Johannesburg.

201
00:18:14,524 --> 00:18:16,990
He too does not write anymore.

202
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,009
- John Kumalo - carpenter.
- Ah! John Kumalo.

203
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:23,778
Oh, yes, oh, yes, I know him.

204
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:26,057
He is too busy to write.

205
00:18:26,058 --> 00:18:28,351
He is one of our great politicians.

206
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,650
Has no use
for for the church anymore.

207
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:33,761
He says that what God
has not done for South Africa,

208
00:18:33,762 --> 00:18:36,030
man must do.

209
00:18:44,705 --> 00:18:46,690
This is a bitter journey.

210
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:50,363
We shall start tomorrow
and try to sweeten it.

211
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,261
Sleep well.

212
00:18:52,263 --> 00:18:54,561
Go well, my brother.

213
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,856
Come here you, bitch!

214
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,340
I told you not to come here again.

215
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,470
Just get out of here!

216
00:19:42,471 --> 00:19:45,120
Unless you want to be?????, umfundisi.

217
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:47,170
Hey, where you
think you're going to?

218
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,010
<i>Come back, you bastards!</i>

219
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,498
Hypocrites!

220
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,022
The lady in pink. Where is she?
Have you seen her?

221
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,503
The lady in pink.

222
00:19:57,072 --> 00:19:58,229
Where is she?

223
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,677
Have you seen her?

224
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:00,990
Where is she?

225
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,459
She is in here.

226
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:06,893
Go well, umfundisi. Do well.

227
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,649
When you are ready,

228
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,587
you will find me the next door house,
number thirteen.

229
00:20:16,622 --> 00:20:21,000
A man and a woman
of our church live there. I'll wait.

230
00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:04,000
My sister...

231
00:21:04,736 --> 00:21:06,090
you've ashamed of us.

232
00:21:06,611 --> 00:21:08,190
Why, Gertrude? Why?

233
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,482
I had to have money for the child.

234
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,875
Where is the child?

235
00:21:11,876 --> 00:21:13,617
I will sent for him.

236
00:21:13,618 --> 00:21:16,200
Where is your husband?

237
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,130
I have not found him,
my brother.

238
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,361
I have come to take you back.

239
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,999
Do you wish to come back?

240
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:30,624
Do you wish with your heart

241
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:32,559
to come back?

242
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,160
I do not like Johannesburg.

243
00:21:35,346 --> 00:21:38,619
I am a bad woman, my brother.
I'm no woman to go back.

244
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,305
I've been in prision.

245
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:47,647
No. I'm a bad woman.

246
00:21:50,243 --> 00:21:52,810
God forgives us!

247
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,207
You thieves.
You're stealing my property.

248
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,040
She is mine property, Bitch!

249
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:17,595
You did want to leave me!

250
00:22:19,348 --> 00:22:22,102
Come back here! Come back here!

251
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,720
And you, why are you standing here?
Getting back! Come on, back!

252
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,940
My son Absalom!

253
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:41,200
Have you not heard of him?

254
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:43,624
I did heard of him.

255
00:22:43,953 --> 00:22:45,626
He lived in Sophiatown.

256
00:22:45,627 --> 00:22:47,652
Where, I'm not sure. But...

257
00:22:47,653 --> 00:22:52,643
he was often together with the
son of our brother John. He will know.

258
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:01,622
- All we ask for is justice!
- Justice!

259
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,732
Justice!

260
00:23:03,733 --> 00:23:05,381
Dignidade!

261
00:23:05,382 --> 00:23:08,690
Decência!

262
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:12,691
Here in Johannesburg

263
00:23:12,692 --> 00:23:14,472
it is the mines!

264
00:23:14,473 --> 00:23:15,823
<i>The mines!</i>

265
00:23:15,824 --> 00:23:18,464
Everything is the mines.

266
00:23:18,591 --> 00:23:19,355
The mines!

267
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:22,718
Everything the white man
has is built...

268
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:25,859
with the gold from the mines!

269
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,504
The mines!

270
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,700
The hospital...

271
00:23:30,151 --> 00:23:32,832
for europeans...

272
00:23:33,557 --> 00:23:36,658
the biggest hospital south

273
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:38,618
of the Ecuador...

274
00:23:38,906 --> 00:23:41,000
is built

275
00:23:41,123 --> 00:23:44,053
with the gold from the mines.

276
00:23:44,054 --> 00:23:46,379
The mines!

277
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,200
But...

278
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,860
go...

279
00:23:53,926 --> 00:23:57,690
go to our hospital...

280
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,867
and see our people...

281
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,226
lying on the floors.

282
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:09,851
They lie so close

283
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:13,652
you cannot step over them.

284
00:24:14,225 --> 00:24:16,620
Everything is built

285
00:24:16,629 --> 00:24:18,676
on our labour.

286
00:24:19,064 --> 00:24:21,585
And we get poorer

287
00:24:21,586 --> 00:24:24,932
and the white man gets richer.

288
00:24:24,933 --> 00:24:26,871
So now...

289
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,778
they will put up...

290
00:24:29,779 --> 00:24:32,642
our bus fares.

291
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:37,400
But we know how to answer them!

292
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:42,500
We will do what must be done!

293
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:47,200
Talk to your brothers
and to your sisters.

294
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:50,378
Tell them what is decided.

295
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,500
Mbumba!

296
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,472
Go well.

297
00:24:56,473 --> 00:24:59,100
Stay well.

298
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:34,601
Now the meeting is over,
I'm locking up now.

299
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,055
Umfundisi!

300
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:41,637
I'm surprised to see
men of the cloth here tonight.

301
00:25:41,638 --> 00:25:43,900
Good evening my own brother.

302
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,750
<i>Well, well!</i>

303
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,722
What are you doing in Johannesburg?

304
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:51,400
- Do you know the Reverend Msimangu?
- Of course.

305
00:25:52,209 --> 00:25:54,700
Everybody knows the good Reverend.

306
00:25:54,961 --> 00:25:56,812
<i>You did not write to us my brother.</i>

307
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,890
Why?

308
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,850
You people in Ndotsheni do not
understand the way life

309
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:03,390
in Johannesburg.

310
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,190
I thought it better not to write.

311
00:26:05,204 --> 00:26:08,312
Trouble, unnecessary trouble.

312
00:26:08,313 --> 00:26:09,933
I want to ask you something,
my brother.

313
00:26:09,934 --> 00:26:12,200
I do not give money
to the church.

314
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:17,347
- Reverend Msimangu knows that.
- No, no. It is not about the money.

315
00:26:18,363 --> 00:26:19,900
Where is my son?

316
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,950
Well...

317
00:26:24,969 --> 00:26:28,219
you have heard, no doubt,
that he was friendly with my son.

318
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,658
I have heard that, yes.

319
00:26:29,659 --> 00:26:32,649
Oh, then you know
how these young men are.

320
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:34,825
I do not blame them all together.

321
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,835
He wanted to live near his work.

322
00:26:36,836 --> 00:26:39,922
She had good work.
So, I did not stop him.

323
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:41,572
And your son went with him.

324
00:26:41,573 --> 00:26:43,000
And where, my brother?

325
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:45,794
I have a letter from him
here somewhere. Yes.

326
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,787
Yes, here it is.

327
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,560
Yes, with the address.

328
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,739
My worded
date is over a year ago.

329
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,885
I really must write to him.

330
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,602
Will we go.

331
00:27:00,637 --> 00:27:03,082
My hands are yours, my friend.

332
00:27:03,857 --> 00:27:08,860
<i>- Sawabona.
- Thank you.</i>

333
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:26,374
My brother...
is greately changed.

334
00:27:26,747 --> 00:27:28,697
But he has some truth on his side.

335
00:27:28,732 --> 00:27:29,724
Truth?

336
00:27:29,725 --> 00:27:31,994
But how can he have truth on his side
and not God?

337
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,557
But at least he is got something.

338
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,085
<i>Look around you.</i>

339
00:27:36,086 --> 00:27:37,370
<i>What do you see?</i>

340
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:39,849
Poverty, pain, suffering?

341
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:43,252
Sometimes it's hard, even for me,
to keep faith.

342
00:27:44,818 --> 00:27:46,752
Perhaps God is on his side.

343
00:27:46,753 --> 00:27:49,500
Only your brother does not
want to know it anymore.

344
00:28:24,347 --> 00:28:26,400
Here, hold this.

345
00:28:51,735 --> 00:28:53,200
Well, captain...

346
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:54,826
have you brought us some rain today?

347
00:28:54,827 --> 00:28:57,440
I don't see any Mr. Jarvis.

348
00:28:57,451 --> 00:28:59,765
<i>Well, no.</i>

349
00:29:00,265 --> 00:29:02,240
No...

350
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:04,605
neither do I.

351
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,690
Mr. Jarvis...

352
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,940
Tobias? Try the carburetor.

353
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:14,446
Yes.

354
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:17,373
I have some bad news for you, sir.

355
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,680
Is it my son?

356
00:29:21,694 --> 00:29:23,800
Yes, Mr. Jarvis.

357
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,500
Is he dead?

358
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,968
I'm afraid so, sir.

359
00:29:39,921 --> 00:29:41,390
Dead?

360
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,793
Yes, sir.

361
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,890
Sir!

362
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,105
I'm all right.

363
00:30:06,208 --> 00:30:07,270
I'm all right.

364
00:30:07,662 --> 00:30:09,823
I'm all right.

365
00:30:12,838 --> 00:30:15,190
- He was shot dead late in today in Johannesburg, sir.
- Shot?

366
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,832
Shot?

367
00:30:16,867 --> 00:30:18,700
Shot? Dead?

368
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,100
Yes, sir.

369
00:30:21,924 --> 00:30:26,219
They suspect a native gang, sir.

370
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,671
A native gang?

371
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,373
Yes, sir.

372
00:30:32,942 --> 00:30:35,185
Did you know his wife is away, sir?

373
00:30:35,186 --> 00:30:36,550
His wife...

374
00:30:36,574 --> 00:30:38,531
Ah, yes, yes. She is...

375
00:30:38,532 --> 00:30:41,996
She is here.
She is here with us.

376
00:30:42,505 --> 00:30:44,800
With her son... My...

377
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,203
My, my... my grandson.

378
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:53,105
I'm sorry, Mr. Jarvis.

379
00:30:53,445 --> 00:30:55,490
I really I'm sorry to bring this new, sir.

380
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,021
Is very kind of you.

381
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:59,751
Is very kind of you.

382
00:31:01,091 --> 00:31:04,900
<i>I'm instructed to offer you
every assistances, Mr. Jarvis.</i>

383
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:10,097
<i>Is there someone around
I can use the telephone?</i>

384
00:31:17,958 --> 00:31:19,450
Shot dead?

385
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,990
Yes, sir.

386
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,958
<i>Have you catch this...</i>

387
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,900
gang of natives?

388
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:28,793
Not yet, sir.

389
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,932
Oh, God...

390
00:31:32,967 --> 00:31:35,148
shot dead!

391
00:32:03,722 --> 00:32:06,404
<i>Hello grand-daddy.</i>

392
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:11,857
- He was our only child, do you know?
- I know that, Mr. Jarvis.

393
00:32:23,233 --> 00:32:25,790
The telephone is in the hall.

394
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:29,167
- Is a party line.
- Thank you, sir.

395
00:32:35,949 --> 00:32:38,294
<i>Everything alright, dear?</i>

396
00:32:40,477 --> 00:32:42,250
<i>Yeah, I...</i>

397
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,031
Ian... my study...

398
00:32:46,486 --> 00:32:47,919
<i>my tobacco pouch...</i>

399
00:32:47,923 --> 00:32:49,048
<i>would you?</i>

400
00:32:49,051 --> 00:32:50,873
He is a good lad.

401
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,700
There's been...

402
00:33:04,735 --> 00:33:06,052
There's been an accident.

403
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,053
<i>No!</i>

404
00:33:08,088 --> 00:33:09,651
Mom!

405
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,500
Ah, yes, Captain Collins.

406
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:18,650
<i>This is a terrible thing
whas happened.</i>

407
00:33:18,655 --> 00:33:21,626
<i>Arthur Jarvis
was a courageous young man,</i>

408
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,873
and he was a great
fighter for justice.

409
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,097
It is indeed a terrible thing.

410
00:33:28,132 --> 00:33:30,230
He was president of the
African Boys' Club.

411
00:33:30,231 --> 00:33:33,100
Here in Claremont,
in Gladiolus Street.

412
00:33:34,794 --> 00:33:36,638
We are talking about the murder.

413
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:39,186
Everyone is talking about the murder.

414
00:33:39,221 --> 00:33:42,700
I expected you knew this man,
Arthur Jarvis.

415
00:33:44,454 --> 00:33:47,064
- Jarvis?
- He came from your part the country.

416
00:33:48,066 --> 00:33:50,476
It says here...
Mr. Arthur Jarvis

417
00:33:50,511 --> 00:33:53,657
the only son os Mr. and Mrs. James Jarvis,

418
00:33:53,692 --> 00:33:55,500
Carlsbrooke, the town.

419
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,706
I know the father.

420
00:34:01,741 --> 00:34:04,124
I know him by sight and by name.

421
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:06,316
<i>We've never spoken.</i>

422
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:10,100
His farm is in the hills above Ndotsheni.

423
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:13,675
<i>Sometimes he rode past my church.</i>

424
00:34:14,263 --> 00:34:17,180
I did not known the son.

425
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,320
<i>Yet...</i>

426
00:34:23,037 --> 00:34:25,355
I remember...

427
00:34:25,356 --> 00:34:27,500
a small bright boy.

428
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:31,300
<i>He too sometimes
rode on his horse past the church.</i>

429
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,500
Excuse me, umfundisi. Sorry.

430
00:34:56,459 --> 00:34:57,459
<i>Umfundisi...</i>

431
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,797
are going to Alexandra?

432
00:34:58,850 --> 00:34:59,611
Yes.

433
00:34:59,612 --> 00:35:01,100
He are here to stop you.

434
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:03,297
You see, if you take this bus...

435
00:35:03,418 --> 00:35:05,360
you are weakening
the cause of the black people.

436
00:35:05,421 --> 00:35:07,218
Our business is very urgent.

437
00:35:07,284 --> 00:35:10,167
This boycott is also very urgent..

438
00:35:10,202 --> 00:35:11,936
Is it that long way to walk?

439
00:35:11,971 --> 00:35:15,000
It is the long way, umfundisi.
Perhaps 11 miles.

440
00:35:15,911 --> 00:35:17,661
That is a very long way
for an old man.

441
00:35:17,662 --> 00:35:20,856
Men as old as you
are doing it every day, umfundisi.

442
00:35:20,857 --> 00:35:22,161
And women.

443
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:25,564
And some are sick and
some are crippled. And children.

444
00:35:25,565 --> 00:35:28,944
They start at four in the morning,
and they turn at eight at night.

445
00:35:28,945 --> 00:35:31,397
I cannot stop you for taking
this bus, but...

446
00:35:31,398 --> 00:35:33,618
this is a cause we are fighting for.

447
00:35:35,626 --> 00:35:39,351
- Very well. We shall not use the bus.
- Thank you, umfundisi.

448
00:35:39,352 --> 00:35:41,400
Go well.

449
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:52,058
Sawubona (Hello), Ms. Mkize.

450
00:36:52,059 --> 00:36:53,640
What do you want?

451
00:36:53,644 --> 00:36:56,700
We are here about
Absalom Kumalo.

452
00:37:00,069 --> 00:37:01,700
<i>When did he go?</i>

453
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,400
A year it must be.

454
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,417
- And had he a friend?
- Sim.

455
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,744
The son of his father's brother.
But they left together.

456
00:37:11,195 --> 00:37:12,719
And did you no know where they went?

457
00:37:12,754 --> 00:37:14,595
No, they talked of many places.

458
00:37:14,596 --> 00:37:19,129
And how did he behave himself,
this Absalom Kumalo?

459
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,900
- I saw nothing wrong.
- But you guess that was something...

460
00:37:21,901 --> 00:37:22,797
<i>There was nothing wrong.</i>

461
00:37:22,798 --> 00:37:25,204
- Then why are you afraid.
- I'm not afraid.

462
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:30,936
- Why do you tremble?
- Because I'm cold.

463
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,600
There is something wrong.

464
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:57,155
My friend,
two of us are on too many.

465
00:37:57,156 --> 00:38:03,156
Turn left that a big street. There is a
place of refreshment. Wait for me there.

466
00:38:10,492 --> 00:38:12,500
Mrs. Mkize!

467
00:38:12,936 --> 00:38:14,700
Mrs. Mkize!

468
00:38:14,819 --> 00:38:17,051
- Mrs. Mkize!
- What do you want?

469
00:38:17,052 --> 00:38:19,710
That old man was with me
is the father of Absalom Kumalo.

470
00:38:19,711 --> 00:38:21,796
He is suffering because
cannot find his son.

471
00:38:21,831 --> 00:38:24,360
- That is a bad thing.
- Yes it is a bad thing.

472
00:38:24,395 --> 00:38:26,899
- Tell me what you would not tell to him.
- I have nothing to tell.

473
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,743
No doubt and if it is necessary
I shall go to the police

474
00:38:28,744 --> 00:38:30,041
because there will be
no other place to go.

475
00:38:30,042 --> 00:38:31,454
It is hard for a woman who is alone.

476
00:38:31,455 --> 00:38:33,449
It is hard for an old man
looking for his son.

477
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:35,000
No, I'm afraid.

478
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,243
I swear to you on this "Book"...

479
00:38:38,244 --> 00:38:40,686
that no trouble
will come to you of this.

480
00:38:40,721 --> 00:38:42,735
For we seek only a boy.

481
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,100
So help me God!

482
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,200
What sort of a life did they lead?

483
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,290
They brought many things here, umfundisi.

484
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,600
What things?

485
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,246
Clothes, watches, money...

486
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,453
food in bottles and tins
and many other things.

487
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,854
And why did they leave?

488
00:39:03,855 --> 00:39:06,886
<i>I think they were been near to being
discovered, umfundisi.</i>

489
00:39:07,227 --> 00:39:08,460
And they left when?

490
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:10,255
About a year, since.

491
00:39:10,352 --> 00:39:12,500
Indeed as I told you.

492
00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:15,459
But I do not know where they have gone.

493
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:22,200
<i>Thank you.</i>

494
00:39:31,706 --> 00:39:33,963
<i>Umfundisi!</i>

495
00:39:37,411 --> 00:39:39,679
<i>They were friend with a
taxi driver, Hiabeni.</i>

496
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,894
You'll find him at the bus stop.
Everyone knows him.

497
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:46,585
Thank you, Ms. Mkize.

498
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,285
<i>- Mr. Hiabeni...
- How did you know my name?</i>

499
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:02,818
A little black bird told me.

500
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,593
She also told me you can help us find
a young man,

501
00:40:05,594 --> 00:40:08,119
Absalom Kumalo.

502
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:11,773
<i>I'm not here to make troubles for you.</i>

503
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:14,252
But may companion
is the father of the young man.

504
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,699
Nice to meet you, umfundisi.

505
00:40:18,909 --> 00:40:21,200
He has come from Natal to find him.

506
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:22,650
<i>Can you help us?</i>

507
00:40:22,875 --> 00:40:26,257
<i>- I knew this young man, umfundisi.
- And where is he now?</i>

508
00:40:26,321 --> 00:40:28,208
I heard he was gone to Orlando.

509
00:40:28,922 --> 00:40:30,891
But, Orlando is big place.

510
00:40:31,489 --> 00:40:33,750
Where the squatters are.
It is not so big.

511
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:57,280
Nurse.

512
00:40:58,900 --> 00:40:59,999
Mr. Msimangu!

513
00:41:00,536 --> 00:41:02,890
- Sawubona (I see you).
- Yebo (yes, I see you too).

514
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:06,755
You know everyone in this...
godforsaken place.

515
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:08,800
<i>We are looking for a young man...</i>

516
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,800
the son of my brother, here.

517
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:15,033
<i>The boy's name is Absalom Kumalo.</i>

518
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,850
Did you ever know him?

519
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,060
- Yes.
- And where does he live?

520
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,690
I'm sorry, umfundisi...

521
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,780
<i>this time he is not here.</i>

522
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,680
<i>They took him away.</i>

523
00:41:27,684 --> 00:41:30,271
<i>The magistrate sent him to the reformatory.</i>

524
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:31,499
<i>- Derick!
- Present!</i>

525
00:41:31,502 --> 00:41:32,530
<i>- Tumi!
- Present!</i>

526
00:41:32,532 --> 00:41:33,601
- Dembiso!
- Present!

527
00:41:33,602 --> 00:41:34,134
- David!
- Present!

528
00:41:34,235 --> 00:41:36,440
<i>Strange!</i>

529
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,013
<i>Absalom tol us</i>

530
00:41:38,014 --> 00:41:39,600
he had no people.

531
00:41:39,624 --> 00:41:42,373
He was, no doubt, ashamed.

532
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,679
Your son did very well with us,
umfundisi.

533
00:41:45,854 --> 00:41:49,406
He became one of our senior boys
and I have great hope for his future.

534
00:41:49,441 --> 00:41:51,500
You mean, sir, that he is gone?

535
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,670
Yes.

536
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:57,550
<i>But only a month ago.</i>

537
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,889
We released him early.

538
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:04,869
Partly because of his age and
partly because of his good behaviour.

539
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:12,500
But mainly because there was a girl
who is pregnant by him.

540
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:17,200
And is he now married, sir?

541
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:20,100
No, umfundisi,
he is not married.

542
00:42:20,853 --> 00:42:22,915
But that not must to worry you.

543
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:24,353
The real question is

544
00:42:24,354 --> 00:42:27,800
whether he will care for them,
and lead a decent life.

545
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:31,390
<i>We arrange housing for them at Pimville.</i>

546
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:36,517
<i>So If you waited until I finish my work,
I can take you to see them .</i>

547
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:50,318
<i>We have come to inquire after Absalom.</i>

548
00:42:50,793 --> 00:42:53,311
This umfundisi is his father.

549
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:59,331
He went on Saturday to Springs.
Has not yet returned.

550
00:42:59,555 --> 00:43:01,600
But this is Tuesday.

551
00:43:05,377 --> 00:43:07,650
Have you heard nothing from him?

552
00:43:07,878 --> 00:43:09,901
<i>Nothing.</i>

553
00:43:12,097 --> 00:43:14,368
When will he return?

554
00:43:14,369 --> 00:43:15,700
I do not know.

555
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:18,660
What will you do?

556
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:23,212
I do not know.

557
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,800
You can do nothing here.
Let us go.

558
00:43:25,822 --> 00:43:26,989
- Hey...
- I tell you...

559
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:28,580
<i>you can do nothing.</i>

560
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,506
<i>Have you not troubles enough of your own?</i>

561
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:32,780
There are thousands
like her in Johannesburg.

562
00:43:32,794 --> 00:43:34,800
You do not understand.

563
00:43:34,918 --> 00:43:38,888
- That child will you be my grandchild.
- Great!

564
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:42,250
Even that you do not know.

565
00:43:44,075 --> 00:43:46,138
Thank you.

566
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,719
Do not give up hope, umfundisi.

567
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,294
And I will not give up the search.

568
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,619
He is a good man.

569
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:29,435
Come, let us walk.

570
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:37,200
What is it my friend?

571
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,647
I am ashamed to walk with you.

572
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,740
I ask you forgiveness my ugly words.

573
00:44:47,775 --> 00:44:49,813
You mean about the girl?

574
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:52,113
You are quick to understand.

575
00:44:52,114 --> 00:44:53,800
I'm old.

576
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:57,302
Have learned something.

577
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,967
You are forgiven.

578
00:45:37,123 --> 00:45:39,438
I am sorry.

579
00:45:41,331 --> 00:45:44,126
What can I say?

580
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:49,790
Mary.

581
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,200
I'm sorry, Mary.

582
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:54,631
I...

583
00:45:54,632 --> 00:45:57,362
taken the liberty to you
of canceling your hotel booking on.

584
00:45:57,397 --> 00:45:59,440
I thought will might
personal with us.

585
00:45:59,448 --> 00:46:01,371
Very good of you, Glyn.

586
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,900
This two officers want
to hear a word of you.

587
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:07,223
<i>Why don't you go to the car?
Be with you in a minute.</i>

588
00:46:07,336 --> 00:46:09,632
Come on, Mary. I am so sorry.

589
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:14,362
Please, accept our deep sympathy, Mr.
Jarvis.

590
00:46:14,397 --> 00:46:16,569
I'm sorry to have to do this
to you the moment you arrived

591
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:18,920
but you need formululize
the identification of the body.

592
00:46:18,921 --> 00:46:20,340
Mr. Henderson near offer to do it,

593
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:21,729
but it needs to be next of kin.

594
00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:24,199
- In fact needs to be...
- No! I'll do it.

595
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:26,689
I will be with Mary.

596
00:46:28,398 --> 00:46:31,498
- Have you caught the killers?
- Not yet.

597
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:38,534
My son was that champion,
you know?

598
00:47:14,608 --> 00:47:17,300
Bloody kaffers.

599
00:47:17,350 --> 00:47:20,356
Whoever did this...

600
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:23,500
find them...

601
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:26,556
hang them!

602
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:29,150
Bastards!

603
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:32,200
Bloody bastards!

604
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,711
Pastures green he leadeth me

605
00:47:39,712 --> 00:47:41,718
the quiet waters...

606
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:20,791
<i>"There is fear in the land..."</i>

607
00:48:20,958 --> 00:48:24,601
<i>And fear in the hearts
of all who live there.</i>

608
00:48:24,602 --> 00:48:29,370
<i>And fear puts an end to understanding
and the need to understand.</i>

609
00:48:29,534 --> 00:48:33,904
<i>So how shall we fashion such a land
when there is fear in the heart?</i>

610
00:48:33,905 --> 00:48:36,825
<i>The white man will
put more locks on his door...</i>

611
00:48:36,826 --> 00:48:38,890
<i>and get a fine fierce dog...</i>

612
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:41,748
<i>but the beauty
of the trees and of the stars...</i>

613
00:48:41,915 --> 00:48:45,258
<i>these things we shall forego.</i>

614
00:48:45,641 --> 00:48:48,209
<i>Cry, the beloved country...</i>

615
00:48:48,244 --> 00:48:49,826
<i>for the unborn child...</i>

616
00:48:49,827 --> 00:48:52,190
<i>that is the inheritor of our fear.</i>

617
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,749
<i>Let him not love the earth too deeply.</i>

618
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:58,722
<i>Let him not be too moved
when the birds of his land are singing...</i>

619
00:48:58,723 --> 00:49:02,371
<i>nor give too much
of his heart to a mountain or a valley.</i>

620
00:49:02,716 --> 00:49:07,286
<i>For fear will rob him
of all if his gives too much.</i>

621
00:49:07,776 --> 00:49:08,478
<i>Yes.,..</i>

622
00:49:08,532 --> 00:49:09,772
<i>Cry...</i>

623
00:49:10,004 --> 00:49:11,116
<i>cry...</i>

624
00:49:11,217 --> 00:49:13,300
<i>"the beloved country."</i>

625
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:54,800
<i>The police way here, my child?</i>

626
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:58,327
- Yes, umfundisi.
- And what do they want?

627
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:02,152
- They wanted Absalom, umfundisi.
- And why do they want him?

628
00:50:02,354 --> 00:50:03,990
I do not know.

629
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,722
- And why did you not ask?
- I was afraid.

630
00:50:07,723 --> 00:50:09,990
Did no one asked?

631
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:15,382
The women were about.
Maybe one of them asked.

632
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,890
This is exactly your son leaved, Mr.
Jarvis.

633
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:28,040
Nothing is been touched.

634
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:29,707
Thank you.

635
00:50:30,457 --> 00:50:33,457
I'll be in the car if
there is anything else.

636
00:50:39,155 --> 00:50:41,104
James, ?????
So his papers for you, if you like.

637
00:50:41,105 --> 00:50:42,406
No, no, no, no. Thank you, Glyn.

638
00:50:42,407 --> 00:50:46,500
This is something I wish to do myself.

639
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:07,204
Well, this is ironic.

640
00:51:07,950 --> 00:51:09,107
What is?

641
00:51:09,109 --> 00:51:12,835
<i>He must to be writing this,
when...</i>

642
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:15,255
when...

643
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:19,463
<i>"It is not"</i>

644
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:21,716

00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,025
<i>"which is the problem, but white crime."</i>

646
00:51:26,953 --> 00:51:30,100
<i>Arthur and I didn't always agree
on the native question. He...</i>

647
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:32,500
He was an idealist.

648
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:34,712
Yes, yes, yes.

649
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,850
<i>I think he ought be hard on the natives,
but also he...</i>

650
00:51:38,878 --> 00:51:41,833
he said the whatever crimes they committed

651
00:51:41,834 --> 00:51:43,792
we more less our fault.

652
00:51:44,488 --> 00:51:47,272
<i>I don't really understand.</i>

653
00:51:47,348 --> 00:51:50,209
<i>I don't mean that he wasn't sincere.</i>

654
00:51:51,156 --> 00:51:54,708
No, no, no.
Of course not, of course not.

655
00:51:55,258 --> 00:51:58,400
"What sort of memorial do we want?"

656
00:51:58,767 --> 00:51:59,915
What?

657
00:52:00,002 --> 00:52:03,560
I'm... I'm...
I'm reading what...

658
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:04,958
he wrote...

659
00:52:05,283 --> 00:52:07,571
<i>just before I if...</i>

660
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,047
"What sort of memorial"

661
00:52:11,048 --> 00:52:13,451
do we deserve?

662
00:52:13,864 --> 00:52:17,445
We call ourselves Christian people.

663
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:21,342
When posterity come to judge us

664
00:52:21,377 --> 00:52:23,900
<i>it will consign us</i>

665
00:52:23,928 --> 00:52:26,573
<i>to this...</i>

666
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:34,833
the sewers of history...

667
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:39,059
as tyrants...

668
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:41,744
oppressors...

669
00:52:42,878 --> 00:52:45,500
"and criminals."

670
00:52:46,125 --> 00:52:47,190
<i>Sir...</i>

671
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,802
<i>I'm sorry for interrupting you, but...</i>

672
00:52:48,907 --> 00:52:50,700
I thought you would like to know.

673
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:52,232
<i>We've caught them.</i>

674
00:52:52,233 --> 00:52:53,700
<i>All three of them.</i>

675
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:56,663
And we know which one pull the trigger.

676
00:53:03,522 --> 00:53:05,800
I came as soon as I heard.

677
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,200
Thank you.

678
00:53:10,350 --> 00:53:13,591
<i>One of the other two is
the son of your brother.</i>

679
00:53:23,550 --> 00:53:24,957
Absalom Kumalo?

680
00:53:25,150 --> 00:53:26,602
In there.

681
00:53:26,603 --> 00:53:28,099
Matthew Kumalo?

682
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:29,871
In there.

683
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:45,340
<i>At last I have found you.</i>

684
00:53:45,350 --> 00:53:48,438
<i>I have search in every place for you.</i>

685
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:52,315
<i>Why did you do this terrible thing?</i>

686
00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:55,750
Answer me, my child.

687
00:53:55,867 --> 00:53:57,920
I do not know.

688
00:53:58,187 --> 00:54:00,500
<i>Why did you carry a revolver?</i>

689
00:54:01,961 --> 00:54:04,323
For safety, my father.

690
00:54:04,707 --> 00:54:07,030
This Joanesburgo is a dangerous place.

691
00:54:07,031 --> 00:54:09,768
<i>A man never knows
when he is going to be attacked.</i>

692
00:54:10,484 --> 00:54:13,815
But why take it to the house?

693
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:18,100
Have they got it, my child?

694
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:22,590
<i>They have no doubt it was you?</i>

695
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:25,200
I told them.

696
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:28,470
What did you tell them?

697
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:34,249
I told them I was frightened when
the white man came. So I shot him.

698
00:54:34,513 --> 00:54:37,419
<i>I did not mean to kill him.</i>

699
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:39,590
And your cousin and the other?

700
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,710
Yes.

701
00:54:41,728 --> 00:54:44,000
I told them. They came with me,

702
00:54:44,450 --> 00:54:47,159
but it was I who shot the white man.

703
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,000
Absalom...

704
00:54:51,338 --> 00:54:52,790
Sir...

705
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:55,300
<i>I shall do what I can for you.</i>

706
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:59,110
He's got one minute!

707
00:54:59,122 --> 00:55:00,934
<i>My child...</i>

708
00:55:00,935 --> 00:55:04,598
do not write to your mother
untill I see you again.

709
00:55:04,633 --> 00:55:06,500
<i>I must first write to her.</i>

710
00:55:06,648 --> 00:55:08,227
It's good, my father.

711
00:55:08,350 --> 00:55:11,695
Come on, come on.
We haven't got all day.

712
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:17,858
<i>Stay well, my child.</i>

713
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:21,300
Go well, my father.

714
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,601
We should go at once and see a lawyer.

715
00:55:25,602 --> 00:55:28,183
What should we spend such money?

716
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,145
The story is plain...

717
00:55:30,146 --> 00:55:32,593
there cannot be doubt about it.

718
00:55:34,436 --> 00:55:36,328
What is the story?

719
00:55:36,329 --> 00:55:37,900
They broke into that house,

720
00:55:38,150 --> 00:55:39,781
<i>they struck down the servant.</i>

721
00:55:39,782 --> 00:55:41,490
And my son, not yours,

722
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:43,300
<i>shot the white man.</i>

723
00:55:43,737 --> 00:55:45,355
My son was afraid, he says...

724
00:55:45,356 --> 00:55:47,444
And he told them this.

725
00:55:47,445 --> 00:55:49,720
Why not, if that was the truth?

726
00:55:49,755 --> 00:55:51,792
<i>Perhaps you do not need a lawyer.</i>

727
00:55:51,793 --> 00:55:53,100
Will you have a lawyer then?

728
00:55:53,513 --> 00:55:55,290
Perhaps.

729
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:57,570
But, you see my brother

730
00:55:57,595 --> 00:55:59,443
there is no proof

731
00:55:59,445 --> 00:56:02,532
that my son
or this other young man

732
00:56:02,533 --> 00:56:04,441
was there at all.

733
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:07,608
What do you mean?

734
00:56:07,609 --> 00:56:09,990
<i>My son says that was...
Yes, yes, yes, yes...</i>

735
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,890
But, who...

736
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:14,365
will believe your son?

737
00:56:37,374 --> 00:56:40,550
CLAREMONT,
BOYS CLUB FOR AFRICANS

738
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:43,520
<i>Yeah, yeah, right, right.</i>

739
00:57:40,950 --> 00:57:44,000
<i>Can I help you, sir?</i>

740
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,348
My name is Robert Ndela.

741
00:57:56,383 --> 00:57:58,840
I'm the secretary in here.

742
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:00,902
I'm a teacher.

743
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:04,619
I'm Arthur's father.

744
00:58:06,394 --> 00:58:09,425
It's a friend. Carry on.

745
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:14,477
<i>I'm sorry for your loss.</i>

746
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:19,500
<i>I'm afraid I...</i>

747
00:58:19,850 --> 00:58:22,427
I have no office, but...

748
00:58:29,146 --> 00:58:32,200
<i>we'll never be able
to thank him in properly.</i>

749
00:58:32,451 --> 00:58:34,244
He bought us...

750
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:37,130
he bought us all this.

751
00:58:40,464 --> 00:58:43,379
<i>But these were small things, sir.</i>

752
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:47,124
What your son truly gave to us...

753
00:58:47,989 --> 00:58:50,200
was himself...

754
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:53,742
<i>his time...</i>

755
00:58:53,824 --> 00:58:56,127
his heart.

756
00:58:56,856 --> 00:59:01,500
His believe in a better future.

757
00:59:04,021 --> 00:59:06,012
Yes.

758
00:59:11,615 --> 00:59:13,490
I've read...

759
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:16,055
some of the things he said he believed in.

760
00:59:18,703 --> 00:59:20,885
Sir...

761
00:59:23,550 --> 00:59:25,910
to my knowledge

762
00:59:25,921 --> 00:59:28,474
your son never said...

763
00:59:28,477 --> 00:59:30,890
he believed in something...

764
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,208
unless he believed it.

765
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:40,396
I would like nothing better...

766
00:59:41,350 --> 00:59:44,472
than to understand my boy.

767
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:50,340
He's the only man I've ever met...

768
00:59:50,359 --> 00:59:52,747
black or white...

769
00:59:53,404 --> 00:59:56,388
who saw me for what I am.

770
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
What I really am.

771
00:59:59,323 --> 01:00:01,323
Yes.

772
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:08,276
He was on your side...

773
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:10,233
which makes what happened….

774
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:12,858
He was on no one's side, sir.

775
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:16,061
<i>Except, perhaps, sir...</i>

776
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:19,168
<i>yours and mine.</i>

777
01:00:20,368 --> 01:00:22,863
<i>You must be proud of him.</i>

778
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:26,851
He's a tribute to you.

779
01:01:04,584 --> 01:01:06,540
There were something...

780
01:01:06,550 --> 01:01:08,366
Arthur wrote...

781
01:01:08,367 --> 01:01:11,386
that day that he...

782
01:01:13,142 --> 01:01:14,972
He said:

783
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:17,610
that we told him were nothing.

784
01:01:17,618 --> 01:01:19,120
What did he mean?

785
01:01:19,130 --> 01:01:21,374
He meant that we told him...

786
01:01:21,650 --> 01:01:23,700
nothing...

787
01:01:23,710 --> 01:01:26,976
about the country in which we lived.

788
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:29,650
He said:

789
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:33,473
that we called ourselves christians...

790
01:01:33,508 --> 01:01:35,469
but we are...

791
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:37,890
indifferent...

792
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:41,082
to the sufferings of christians.

793
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,484
He said:

794
01:01:44,490 --> 01:01:48,582
that when we say we are Christians...

795
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,936
what we mean is...

796
01:01:53,166 --> 01:01:56,640
that we are white.

797
01:02:01,216 --> 01:02:03,223
Why?

798
01:02:03,258 --> 01:02:06,379
Why, why, why?

799
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:09,617
Do we bring children

800
01:02:09,620 --> 01:02:12,975
into this world?

801
01:02:14,985 --> 01:02:16,604
Come...

802
01:02:16,610 --> 01:02:18,800
come to bed.

803
01:02:19,850 --> 01:02:22,622
<i>Good morning, umfundisi.</i>

804
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:28,589
- And... how are you, my child?
- I am well, umfundisi.

805
01:02:29,550 --> 01:02:31,860
Have you heard about Absalom?

806
01:02:31,870 --> 01:02:34,458
I have not had, umfundisi.

807
01:02:37,870 --> 01:02:40,900
What I have to say is heavy.

808
01:02:41,298 --> 01:02:42,966
He is in prision.

809
01:02:43,550 --> 01:02:45,700
- In prision?
- Yes.

810
01:02:45,710 --> 01:02:48,390
And for the most terrible
deed that a man can do.

811
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:49,850
He has killed a man.

812
01:02:58,058 --> 01:02:59,300
Child...

813
01:02:59,309 --> 01:03:02,331
do you wish to marry my son?

814
01:03:03,050 --> 01:03:04,903
It is as the umfundisi sees it.

815
01:03:04,904 --> 01:03:07,540
I am asking you, my child.

816
01:03:08,650 --> 01:03:10,121
I can be willing.

817
01:03:10,122 --> 01:03:13,682
It is truth will you wish to marry him?

818
01:03:14,172 --> 01:03:16,939
It is truly my wish, umfundisi.

819
01:03:18,822 --> 01:03:21,018
I must be certain.

820
01:03:21,816 --> 01:03:25,000
I do not wish
to take you into my family

821
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:28,000
if you are unwilling.

822
01:03:29,950 --> 01:03:32,593
I'm willing.

823
01:03:49,202 --> 01:03:50,850
<i>Mr. Carmichael...</i>

824
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:52,894
<i>does my son have any chance?</i>

825
01:03:52,895 --> 01:03:56,959
<i>Well... it is a simple case in many ways.</i>

826
01:03:57,211 --> 01:04:00,300
Your son said that he
fired because he was afraid.

827
01:04:00,612 --> 01:04:03,802
<i>That he, indeed,
not meant to kill.</i>

828
01:04:03,948 --> 01:04:07,290
<i>I shall take the case for you Mr. Kumalo.</i>

829
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:10,563
<i>I shall take it "pro deo",
as we say.</i>

830
01:04:10,692 --> 01:04:13,491
<i>And this my brother,
John Kumalo,</i>

831
01:04:13,492 --> 01:04:15,030
engaged a lawyer also?

832
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:16,497
Oh, yes.

833
01:04:16,750 --> 01:04:18,990
They all say that your son is lying...

834
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:22,200
<i>and that the others two boys
went there at all.</i>

835
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:25,484
I don't believe your son is lying

836
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:30,509
<i>and that's my job to persuade the court
and he speaking the truth.</i>

837
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,100
Is that clear, Mr. Kumalo?

838
01:04:34,650 --> 01:04:36,673
Yes, sir.

839
01:04:39,686 --> 01:04:40,736
My brother...

840
01:04:41,050 --> 01:04:43,126
you should thank God for the lawyer.

841
01:04:43,153 --> 01:04:44,116
He is a good lawyer...

842
01:04:44,117 --> 01:04:45,684
and a good friend to our people.

843
01:04:46,056 --> 01:04:47,553
How can I thank God for the lawyer...

844
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:50,369
<i>and don't have money to pay him?</i>

845
01:04:50,370 --> 01:04:52,540
Did you not hear what he said?

846
01:04:52,550 --> 01:04:55,246
That he will take the case "pro deo".

847
01:04:55,247 --> 01:04:58,836
Which means that it will cost you nothing.

848
01:05:06,445 --> 01:05:08,837
I wish I didn't cry so easily.

849
01:05:08,872 --> 01:05:11,100
I cry too easily in this days.

850
01:05:12,902 --> 01:05:15,000
Go well, umfundisi.

851
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:19,575
<i>Sides in court: </i>

852
01:05:19,576 --> 01:05:22,157
<i>white to the left,
non-european to the right.</i>

853
01:05:22,158 --> 01:05:24,500
<i>All rise!</i>

854
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:40,061
Absalom Kumalo, Matthew Kumalo
and Johannes Pafuri...

855
01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:42,908
<i>you are charged
the murder of Arthur Trevelyan Jarvis</i>

856
01:05:42,910 --> 01:05:46,090
<i>in his house at Plantation Road,
Parkwold, Johannesburg...</i>

857
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:50,005
<i>on Tuesday,
the eighth day of October, 1946.</i>

858
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:53,320
<i>Absalom Kumalo...</i>

859
01:05:53,331 --> 01:05:55,255
<i>how do you plead:
Guilty or not guilty?</i>

860
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:57,798
I plead guilty to the killing.

861
01:05:57,799 --> 01:05:59,800
But I did not meant to kill.

862
01:05:59,860 --> 01:06:02,300
<i>Matthew Kumalo,
how do you plead: Guilty or not guilty?</i>

863
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,650
I'm not guilty.

864
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:08,517
<i>Johannes Pafuri,
how do you plead: Guilty or not guilty?</i>

865
01:06:10,412 --> 01:06:12,784
I'm also not guilty, sir.

866
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:14,700
<i>My lord...</i>

867
01:06:14,896 --> 01:06:18,813
my client, Absalom Kumalo,
will plead guilty to culpable homicide,

868
01:06:18,814 --> 01:06:20,673
for he had no intention to kill.

869
01:06:20,674 --> 01:06:24,790
<i>My lord, there is no charge
of culpable homicide.</i>

870
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:28,100
This is a case of murder
and nothing less than murder.

871
01:06:28,301 --> 01:06:30,309
And that is with murder that the accused,

872
01:06:30,310 --> 01:06:33,786
Absalom Kumalo, is charged.

873
01:06:34,750 --> 01:06:38,044
<i>- In that case...
- He will plead not guilty.</i>

874
01:06:38,083 --> 01:06:40,174
<i>If it please the court...</i>

875
01:06:40,340 --> 01:06:43,321
the facts of this
horrifying crime are simple

876
01:06:43,322 --> 01:06:45,290
<i>and straightforward.</i>

877
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:47,399
<i>Three men set out to rob.</i>

878
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:50,766
<i>One of them carried revolver.</i>

879
01:06:55,330 --> 01:06:57,953
And where was this?

880
01:06:59,759 --> 01:07:01,438
In my hand.

881
01:07:01,768 --> 01:07:05,230
And then what happended?

882
01:07:05,481 --> 01:07:09,611
<i>- The white man came into the passage.
- Yes, yes. And then?</i>

883
01:07:09,967 --> 01:07:12,071
I was frightened.

884
01:07:12,250 --> 01:07:14,903
<i>I fired the revolver.</i>

885
01:07:15,822 --> 01:07:18,346
<i>And then?</i>

886
01:07:21,381 --> 01:07:24,323
- The white man felt.
- Thank you.

887
01:07:24,324 --> 01:07:27,156
<i>Yes, Mr. Carmichael.</i>

888
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:32,079
Why did you carry this revolver?

889
01:07:32,177 --> 01:07:34,524
It was to frighten the
servant of the house.

890
01:07:34,525 --> 01:07:37,266
But, why did you carry any revolver?

891
01:07:37,267 --> 01:07:40,355
Because Johannesburg
is dangerous.

892
01:07:40,356 --> 01:07:44,750
So, was your only reason for carrying
this revolver, to frighten people?

893
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:46,490
Yes, sir.

894
01:07:46,491 --> 01:07:49,404
<i>And when you fired that the white man</i>

895
01:07:49,405 --> 01:07:52,100
<i>it was because you yourself
was frightened?</i>

896
01:07:52,732 --> 01:07:53,782
Yes, sir.

897
01:07:53,893 --> 01:07:55,362
<i>Did you know...</i>

898
01:07:55,550 --> 01:07:57,250
that the revolver was loaded?

899
01:07:57,500 --> 01:08:00,234
<i>Yes, sir, I knew it.</i>

900
01:08:00,235 --> 01:08:03,441
And if this revolver is
just to frighten people...

901
01:08:03,442 --> 01:08:04,800
why must it be loaded?

902
01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:08,383
<i>Were you, perhaps,
prepared to shoot it yourself?</i>

903
01:08:08,384 --> 01:08:09,956
No,

904
01:08:09,957 --> 01:08:12,800
I would not have shot a decent person.

905
01:08:12,804 --> 01:08:15,509
Out of shot only if someone
that shoted at me.

906
01:08:15,762 --> 01:08:18,387
<i>Would you have shot at a policeman</i>

907
01:08:18,578 --> 01:08:21,485
<i>if he had shot at you in
the execution of his duty?</i>

908
01:08:21,633 --> 01:08:23,297
No...

909
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:24,959
not at a policeman.

910
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,293
And the white man you did shot...

911
01:08:27,294 --> 01:08:31,300
was he, perhaps,
not a decent person?

912
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:35,902
<i>I will repeat the question.</i>

913
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,655
<i>The white man you shoted...</i>

914
01:08:37,656 --> 01:08:41,138
<i>was he, perhaps,
not a decent person?</i>

915
01:08:46,381 --> 01:08:48,616
I was afraid.

916
01:08:51,300 --> 01:08:54,300
I did no to meant to shoot him.

917
01:08:57,196 --> 01:09:00,276
This case is adjourned until
monday in the morning.

918
01:09:00,350 --> 01:09:03,006
<i>All rise!</i>

919
01:09:30,270 --> 01:09:34,317
MISSUS SMITH
24 KILKENNY ROAD - SPRINGS

920
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:21,955
What do you want?

921
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:29,400
Umfundisi!

922
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:34,600
Good morning.

923
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:53,006
Are you ill?

924
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:03,332
Thank you, umnumzana (sir).

925
01:11:03,903 --> 01:11:07,903
Are you sure you're not ill, umfundisi?

926
01:11:08,650 --> 01:11:11,624
I am recovered, umnumzana.

927
01:11:13,276 --> 01:11:14,896
Well...

928
01:11:15,820 --> 01:11:18,083
what is it that you are seeking?

929
01:11:35,050 --> 01:11:37,300
I am sorry, umnumzana.

930
01:11:43,377 --> 01:11:46,300
I am sorry to detain you, umnumzana.

931
01:11:48,066 --> 01:11:51,480
It is no matter, umfundisi.

932
01:11:52,284 --> 01:11:54,143
Oh yes, yes...

933
01:11:54,502 --> 01:11:56,614
this is the place.

934
01:11:57,650 --> 01:12:01,285
- There is a man named Sibeko of Ndotsheni.
- Ndotsheni?

935
01:12:01,550 --> 01:12:02,890
I know it.

936
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:05,205
I come from Ndotsheni.

937
01:12:08,334 --> 01:12:10,262
Sibeko's daughter...

938
01:12:10,461 --> 01:12:12,427
worked for a man...

939
01:12:12,462 --> 01:12:14,170
a white man,

940
01:12:14,205 --> 01:12:16,443
uSmith in Ixopo.

941
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:18,090
And...

942
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:19,384
and when his daughter married...

943
01:12:19,385 --> 01:12:22,400
and came here to Springs...

944
01:12:22,450 --> 01:12:24,560
Sibeko's daughter

945
01:12:24,571 --> 01:12:27,590
came here also to work for them.

946
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:30,390
Sibeko has not heard from her
these twelve months.

947
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:33,140
- I see.
- And I promise to...

948
01:12:33,150 --> 01:12:35,285
inquire about this girl.

949
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:40,792
I see.

950
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:43,500
<i>Ah, yes!</i>

951
01:12:44,229 --> 01:12:46,110
Well...

952
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,761
I am...

953
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:51,800
I'm a visitor here.

954
01:12:52,020 --> 01:12:54,306
<i>I'm alone today.</i>

955
01:12:54,606 --> 01:12:56,721
It is the server rest day off...

956
01:12:56,722 --> 01:13:00,742
and the daughter of... uSmith...
is not here.

957
01:13:09,379 --> 01:13:12,696
But she will soon be returning...

958
01:13:14,446 --> 01:13:16,090
if...

959
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:19,573
you wish to wait for her.

960
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:23,250
Please, sit.

961
01:13:23,421 --> 01:13:25,411
<i>Sit.</i>

962
01:13:33,050 --> 01:13:35,166
There is something between...

963
01:13:35,170 --> 01:13:37,190
you and me.

964
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:40,807
But I do not know what it is.

965
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:46,390
Umnumzana...

966
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:47,800
You need not...

967
01:13:47,811 --> 01:13:50,712
be in fear of me, umfundisi.

968
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:53,206
It is true, umnumzana.

969
01:13:53,207 --> 01:13:54,800
You do not know what it is.

970
01:13:55,008 --> 01:13:57,974
But I desire to know.

971
01:13:58,861 --> 01:14:01,924
It is the heaviest thing of all my years.

972
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:04,400
Then tell it.

973
01:14:04,420 --> 01:14:06,712
It will lighten you.

974
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,343
I'm afraid, umnumzana.

975
01:14:11,750 --> 01:14:13,790
I can see.

976
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:16,632
I can see that you are afraid.

977
01:14:16,997 --> 01:14:18,430
But I tell you...

978
01:14:18,439 --> 01:14:22,671
you need not to be in fear of me.

979
01:14:22,766 --> 01:14:25,978
<i>I shall not be angry.</i>

980
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:29,495
This thing,
that is the heaviest of all my years,

981
01:14:29,894 --> 01:14:32,600
is the heaviest thing
of all your years also.

982
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:38,057
That can only mean one thing.

983
01:14:38,900 --> 01:14:39,847
But I...

984
01:14:39,848 --> 01:14:43,900
I still do not understand.

985
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:50,300
It was my son...
that killed your son.

986
01:15:36,652 --> 01:15:38,792
Umfundisi...

987
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:43,525
I understand what I did not understand.

988
01:15:45,969 --> 01:15:48,800
There is no anger in me.

989
01:15:49,672 --> 01:15:52,700
Umnumzana!?!

990
01:15:55,162 --> 01:15:57,681
<i>James, we're back.
Where are you?</i>

991
01:15:57,682 --> 01:16:00,033
I'm in the garden.

992
01:16:00,487 --> 01:16:02,841
That is my wife.

993
01:16:03,569 --> 01:16:05,282
The mistress of the house is with her -...

994
01:16:05,283 --> 01:16:07,300
the daughter of uSmith.

995
01:16:07,542 --> 01:16:09,776
Do you still wish to see her?

996
01:16:09,777 --> 01:16:11,648
Are you recovered?

997
01:16:11,649 --> 01:16:14,988
It is what I came to do,
umnumzana.

998
01:16:22,887 --> 01:16:25,201
Umfundisi...

999
01:16:25,216 --> 01:16:26,726
how did you know me?

1000
01:16:26,727 --> 01:16:28,690
<i>From the court.</i>

1001
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:32,172
And I've seen you riding past Ndotsheni,

1002
01:16:32,180 --> 01:16:34,626
past the church where I work.

1003
01:16:37,693 --> 01:16:39,873
Perhaps...

1004
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:44,021
you also saw the boy.

1005
01:16:44,030 --> 01:16:45,334
<i>He too</i>

1006
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:48,500
used to ride past the church.

1007
01:16:50,054 --> 01:16:52,592
I remember...

1008
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:55,400
He had the brightness in him.

1009
01:16:56,182 --> 01:16:58,102
Yes.

1010
01:16:58,723 --> 01:17:01,226
He had the brightness in him.

1011
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:03,631
<i>There you are.
We were wondered where...</i>

1012
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:05,480
- Yes?
- Barbara...

1013
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:07,190
the umfundisi

1014
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:10,390
has come all the way from Ndotsheni.

1015
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:13,917
He wishes to inquire about
the Sibeko's daughter.

1016
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:15,391
<i>I had to get rid of her.</i>

1017
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:16,690
She drunk.

1018
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:20,316
She is arrested and taken
into jail for a month.

1019
01:17:20,317 --> 01:17:22,133
<i>Of course I could not take her back.</i>

1020
01:17:22,134 --> 01:17:24,683
You don't know where she is now?

1021
01:17:24,684 --> 01:17:25,390
No...

1022
01:17:25,398 --> 01:17:27,386
and I do not care.

1023
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:35,701
I thank you.

1024
01:17:39,206 --> 01:17:40,250
<i>Go well...</i>

1025
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:43,000
umfundisi.

1026
01:17:43,751 --> 01:17:47,211
Stay well, umnumzana.

1027
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,390
<i>And so...</i>

1028
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:03,828
<i>under the law,</i>

1029
01:18:03,863 --> 01:18:07,135
<i>a man is held responsible for his actions.</i>

1030
01:18:07,690 --> 01:18:12,961
<i>It is not for a judge to decide how far
human beings are in truth responsible...</i>

1031
01:18:13,350 --> 01:18:15,423
but under the law

1032
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:18,000
they are fully responsible.

1033
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:21,390
<i>You refer the learned counsel argued</i>

1034
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:23,790
<i>that the system put in South Africa</i>

1035
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:27,736
<i>contributes to the circumstances
of this case.</i>

1036
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:33,030
<i>"Have you, ironically,
held about the murdered man?"</i>

1037
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:34,105
<i>But</i>

1038
01:18:34,245 --> 01:18:36,642
<i>it's not for a judge to apportion blame</i>

1039
01:18:36,643 --> 01:18:38,752
<i>and a defective society</i>

1040
01:18:39,164 --> 01:18:42,900
<i>nor is it for a judge to show mercy.</i>

1041
01:18:43,296 --> 01:18:46,356
<i>After long and careful
deliberation,</i>

1042
01:18:46,357 --> 01:18:49,240
my assistants
and I have decided...

1043
01:18:49,250 --> 01:18:50,767
that the guilt

1044
01:18:50,768 --> 01:18:54,343
of the second and third accused,
in this case...

1045
01:18:54,854 --> 01:18:56,896
is not fully proved

1046
01:18:56,900 --> 01:19:00,207
<i>and they are, therefore,
discharged.</i>

1047
01:19:01,450 --> 01:19:02,450
<i>Silence!</i>

1048
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:03,815
Silence in the court!

1049
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:07,700
<i>Silence in this court room!</i>

1050
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:11,278
<i>Absalom Kumalo...</i>

1051
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:14,669
the court finds you guilty
of the murder

1052
01:19:14,670 --> 01:19:17,300
<i>of Arthur Trevelyan Jarvis,</i>

1053
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,590
<i>at his home in Parkwold,</i>

1054
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:24,976
<i>on the eighth of October, 1946.</i>

1055
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:28,422
<i>Have you anything to say</i>

1056
01:19:28,423 --> 01:19:31,405
<i>before sentences pronounced upon you?</i>

1057
01:19:31,950 --> 01:19:34,490
<i>I have only this to say: </i>

1058
01:19:34,491 --> 01:19:37,500
I killed this man...

1059
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:40,643
but I did not meant to kill him.

1060
01:19:42,371 --> 01:19:44,511
I was afraid.

1061
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,191
<i>I sentence you,</i>

1062
01:19:46,429 --> 01:19:48,480
Absalom Kumalo...

1063
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:51,110
to be returned to the custody

1064
01:19:51,497 --> 01:19:54,690
and to be hang by the neck
until you are dead.

1065
01:19:54,700 --> 01:19:57,629
<i>And may the Lord
have mercy of your soul.</i>

1066
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:02,330
<i>All rise!</i>

1067
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:19,400
Umfundisi...

1068
01:20:25,483 --> 01:20:28,896
It's time to go, umfundisi.

1069
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:45,840
<i>Come, come!</i>

1070
01:20:56,708 --> 01:20:58,250
My son...

1071
01:20:58,300 --> 01:21:01,813
<i>here is your wife that's to be.</i>

1072
01:21:06,100 --> 01:21:09,929
<i>Theirs in God has joined together,
let no man put asunder.</i>

1073
01:21:09,930 --> 01:21:13,649
<i>Forasmuch as Absalom and Katherine
have consented together in holy wedlock</i>

1074
01:21:13,650 --> 01:21:17,077
and have witnessed the same
before God and this company,

1075
01:21:17,078 --> 01:21:21,693
and there to have given and
pledged their troth either to other

1076
01:21:21,728 --> 01:21:25,800
and have declared the same
by giving and receiving a Ring,

1077
01:21:25,900 --> 01:21:28,198
and by joining hands;

1078
01:21:28,199 --> 01:21:29,800
I pronounce

1079
01:21:29,812 --> 01:21:32,290
that they are Man and Wife together.

1080
01:21:32,300 --> 01:21:35,190
In the Name of the Father, Son

1081
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:37,102
and of the Holy Ghost.

1082
01:21:37,103 --> 01:21:38,654
Amen.

1083
01:21:40,397 --> 01:21:43,805
You may now kiss the bride.

1084
01:22:03,842 --> 01:22:07,133
I'm glad you've married, my son.

1085
01:22:07,615 --> 01:22:10,140
I also am glad, my father.

1086
01:22:10,150 --> 01:22:12,990
I shall care for your child,
my son...

1087
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,443
as if it were my own.

1088
01:22:19,700 --> 01:22:22,730
When does my father
return to Ndotsheni?

1089
01:22:22,743 --> 01:22:24,750
Tomorrow.

1090
01:22:25,202 --> 01:22:28,100
And you will tell my
mother that I remember.

1091
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,800
Yes.

1092
01:22:38,650 --> 01:22:41,000
I'm afraid of the hanging.

1093
01:22:41,363 --> 01:22:44,603
- Be of courage, my son.
- I'm afraid of the hanging!

1094
01:22:45,700 --> 01:22:47,947
I am afraid of the hanging!

1095
01:22:49,350 --> 01:22:51,857
<i>Old man, you must go now.</i>

1096
01:22:52,410 --> 01:22:54,441
Come on! Come on, let's go.

1097
01:22:54,442 --> 01:22:55,941
Stay well, my son.

1098
01:22:55,942 --> 01:22:58,359
<i>I shall care for your wife and your child.</i>

1099
01:22:59,200 --> 01:22:59,842
Come!

1100
01:22:59,843 --> 01:23:01,864
Stay well, my son.

1101
01:23:01,899 --> 01:23:04,479
- Don't leave me!
- Come on! Let's go! Come on.

1102
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:06,520
No!

1103
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:24,990
Umfundisi...

1104
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,990
Yes, my child!

1105
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:30,330
I am now your daughter.

1106
01:23:40,543 --> 01:23:43,690
A taxi will be here at seven
to take you to the station.

1107
01:23:43,700 --> 01:23:44,925
Thank you, my brother.

1108
01:23:45,300 --> 01:23:48,544
It is good you are awake,
for I wish to speak to you...

1109
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:51,424
and we may have no further chance.

1110
01:23:53,450 --> 01:23:55,886
I have not told yoy this before,

1111
01:23:57,350 --> 01:23:58,890
but I...

1112
01:23:58,900 --> 01:24:02,202
forsaking the world and all possessions.

1113
01:24:02,617 --> 01:24:03,950
But...

1114
01:24:04,316 --> 01:24:05,728
why?

1115
01:24:05,729 --> 01:24:08,254
Why, my brother, are you doing this thing?

1116
01:24:08,637 --> 01:24:10,480
To pray.

1117
01:24:10,766 --> 01:24:14,700
To pray that my want great fear
will not come to pass.

1118
01:24:14,850 --> 01:24:16,862
What great fear?

1119
01:24:17,050 --> 01:24:21,177
I have this great fear in my heart.
But one day...

1120
01:24:21,526 --> 01:24:24,600
when the white man turn to loving,

1121
01:24:24,700 --> 01:24:27,000
he will find that we turned to hating.

1122
01:24:38,550 --> 01:24:40,173
I...

1123
01:24:40,893 --> 01:24:43,363
saved a little money.

1124
01:24:44,750 --> 01:24:47,900
I have no mother or father
to depend on me,

1125
01:24:48,970 --> 01:24:52,982
I have the permission of the Church
to give this to you, my friend.

1126
01:24:53,868 --> 01:24:57,548
To help you with all the money
you spent in Johannesburg.

1127
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:00,600
Do not Cry.

1128
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,566
Do not spoil this pleasure for me.

1129
01:25:02,567 --> 01:25:05,500
For I have never
had a pleasure like this one.

1130
01:25:18,193 --> 01:25:19,193
As for your son...

1131
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:22,450
they may still decide that
there will be mercy for him.

1132
01:25:23,750 --> 01:25:26,190
If there is no mercy...

1133
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:29,796
I will go up to the mountain on that day.

1134
01:25:30,897 --> 01:25:33,967
Twice before I had done this.

1135
01:25:34,477 --> 01:25:38,957
Once when Absalom was pretty
small and sick unto death;...

1136
01:25:39,630 --> 01:25:41,939
The second time...

1137
01:25:44,900 --> 01:25:48,911
was when I was solely tempted
to commit adultery.

1138
01:25:53,300 --> 01:25:57,000
I have never confessed that before.

1139
01:26:15,519 --> 01:26:17,381
I wish to ask a kindness.

1140
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:20,990
Ask all that I have, my friend.

1141
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:25,600
I ask that you will pray for me
in this new thing I am about to do.

1142
01:26:25,828 --> 01:26:27,433
I shall pray for you,

1143
01:26:27,434 --> 01:26:29,174
morning and evening,

1144
01:26:29,175 --> 01:26:33,300
all the days that are left,
Msimangu, friend of friends.

1145
01:26:33,900 --> 01:26:35,915
Thank you.

1146
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:39,044
What is it Ms. Lithebe?

1147
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:40,740
I'm sorry, umfundisi...

1148
01:26:40,750 --> 01:26:42,925
but your sister, Gertrude, is gone.

1149
01:26:43,132 --> 01:26:45,404
She must have gone in the night.

1150
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:10,003
He is, I think...

1151
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:12,777
the only truly good man I have ever met.

1152
01:27:13,070 --> 01:27:15,038
Then why, I wonder...

1153
01:27:15,039 --> 01:27:17,900
this god not showing many mercy?

1154
01:28:12,100 --> 01:28:15,100
<i>It is umfundisi!</i>

1155
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:23,288
<i>Umfundisi!</i>

1156
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,600
<i>What are these cries, James?</i>

1157
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:37,251
What are do they saying?

1158
01:28:38,766 --> 01:28:40,350
They're saying...

1159
01:28:43,043 --> 01:28:45,655
that he has come back.

1160
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:50,463
<i>Oh, Lord God!</i>

1161
01:28:50,464 --> 01:28:54,089
<i>We thank Thee for Thy unending mercy.</i>

1162
01:28:54,339 --> 01:28:55,593
<i>Oh, God!</i>

1163
01:28:55,594 --> 01:28:58,635
<i>Give us rain, we beseech Thee.</i>

1164
01:28:58,640 --> 01:29:03,390
<i>Give us rain, that we may
plough and sow our seed.</i>

1165
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:05,242
<i>And if there is no rain,</i>

1166
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:10,700
protect us against hunger and starvation,
we pray Thee.

1167
01:29:10,761 --> 01:29:12,966
And also Lord God...

1168
01:29:12,967 --> 01:29:15,571
for my son, Absalom...

1169
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:19,435
<i>forgive him his trespasses.</i>

1170
01:29:19,700 --> 01:29:20,711
Amen.

1171
01:29:20,850 --> 01:29:23,078
<i>Amen.</i>

1172
01:29:25,900 --> 01:29:29,376
Let me read back to you now.

1173
01:29:29,411 --> 01:29:31,600
"My dear mother and father..."

1174
01:29:32,417 --> 01:29:36,500
<i>They told me this morning
there will be no mercy.</i>

1175
01:29:36,937 --> 01:29:41,600
<i>So, I shall not see you or Ndotsheni again.</i>

1176
01:29:41,740 --> 01:29:45,038
<i>I'm dictating this to a priest.</i>

1177
01:29:45,328 --> 01:29:48,573
<i>A black priest from Pretoria.</i>

1178
01:29:48,769 --> 01:29:50,868
"This is a good place."

1179
01:29:51,439 --> 01:29:55,273
I am locked in, and no one
may come and talk to me.

1180
01:29:55,862 --> 01:29:58,091
But I may smoke

1181
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:02,300
and the white men do not speak badly to me.

1182
01:30:02,889 --> 01:30:05,981
<i>I think of you all at Ndotsheni,</i>

1183
01:30:06,520 --> 01:30:08,790
<i>and if I were back there</i>

1184
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:11,095
<i>I should not leave it again.</i>

1185
01:30:11,669 --> 01:30:14,900
<i>"Your lovely son, Absalom. "</i>

1186
01:31:18,360 --> 01:31:20,095
Umfundisi!

1187
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:22,779
<i>May I can shelter in your church?</i>

1188
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:24,380
Indeed!

1189
01:31:24,381 --> 01:31:27,000
Indeed, Umnumzana.

1190
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:45,273
It will soon pass.

1191
01:31:49,900 --> 01:31:51,800
The roof leaks.

1192
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:54,660
So I have noticed.

1193
01:32:12,604 --> 01:32:15,852
The roof leaks in many places.

1194
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:18,982
I have noticed that also.

1195
01:33:25,950 --> 01:33:28,573
It is passing.

1196
01:33:39,473 --> 01:33:41,669
Your son...

1197
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:44,300
have you heard...

1198
01:33:44,710 --> 01:33:46,500
is there...

1199
01:33:46,525 --> 01:33:49,430
mercy for your son?

1200
01:33:58,782 --> 01:34:00,800
When is it to be?

1201
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:04,323
In fifteen days from now.

1202
01:34:04,358 --> 01:34:07,101
At dawn.

1203
01:34:36,408 --> 01:34:39,690
Within comes to the dawn of the fifteen day

1204
01:34:39,700 --> 01:34:42,000
I shall remember.

1205
01:34:45,011 --> 01:34:47,623
Stay well, umfundisi.

1206
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:42,590
Tomorrow the thing will happen.

1207
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:45,327
It is the fifteenth day.

1208
01:35:45,328 --> 01:35:48,300
I'm going up into the mountain.

1209
01:35:48,905 --> 01:35:51,399
<i>Perhaps I could have food.</i>

1210
01:35:51,900 --> 01:35:54,821
It is all that it made.

1211
01:35:59,458 --> 01:36:02,000
I thank you.

1212
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,444
<i>Is that you, Umfundisi?</i>

1213
01:36:28,037 --> 01:36:30,561
Yes I, umnumzana.

1214
01:36:33,500 --> 01:36:35,550
<i>There we are.</i>

1215
01:36:35,570 --> 01:36:37,575
<i>Well met.</i>

1216
01:36:40,100 --> 01:36:42,080
<i>But I knew...</i>

1217
01:36:42,081 --> 01:36:45,074
<i>that you would go up into the mountain...</i>

1218
01:36:45,075 --> 01:36:47,909
on the fifteenth day.

1219
01:36:53,650 --> 01:36:55,411
Oh, yea...

1220
01:36:55,503 --> 01:36:57,790
<i>I have here a letter...</i>

1221
01:36:57,800 --> 01:37:00,784
for the people of your church.

1222
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:06,440
The letter asks...

1223
01:37:06,450 --> 01:37:09,874
if you desire a new church.

1224
01:37:11,046 --> 01:37:13,190
Do you, umfundisi?

1225
01:37:13,200 --> 01:37:16,234
Do you desire a new church?

1226
01:37:18,100 --> 01:37:21,062
<i>The plans will shortly come to you.</i>

1227
01:37:21,097 --> 01:37:24,419
And you must say
if they are what you desire.

1228
01:37:24,420 --> 01:37:28,301
<i>I shall send them to the Bishop,
umnumzana.</i>

1229
01:37:29,050 --> 01:37:32,002
And you will know what to do!

1230
01:37:32,900 --> 01:37:34,900
Perhaps...

1231
01:37:34,955 --> 01:37:37,300
they could build a stone...

1232
01:37:37,301 --> 01:37:40,785
with the name... of my son...

1233
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:44,600
<i>who aren't brightness anymore.</i>

1234
01:37:45,254 --> 01:37:48,622
<i>It shall be done, umnumzana.</i>

1235
01:37:51,577 --> 01:37:55,008
Go well, umfundisi.

1236
01:37:58,108 --> 01:38:02,090
<i>Who knows for what we live
and struggle and die?</i>

1237
01:38:02,100 --> 01:38:05,200
<i>Who knows what keeps us
living and struggling...</i>

1238
01:38:05,265 --> 01:38:07,700
<i>while all things break about us?</i>

1239
01:38:07,900 --> 01:38:11,840
<i>Who knows why the warm flesh
of a child is such comfort,</i>

1240
01:38:11,841 --> 01:38:13,300
<i>when one's own child</i>

1241
01:38:13,350 --> 01:38:16,800
<i>is lost and cannot be recovered?</i>

1242
01:38:17,047 --> 01:38:18,739
<i>Wise men write many books,</i>

1243
01:38:18,740 --> 01:38:21,290
<i>in words too hard to understand.</i>

1244
01:38:21,291 --> 01:38:24,140
<i>But this, the purpose of our lives,</i>

1245
01:38:24,220 --> 01:38:26,096
<i>the end of all our struggle,</i>

1246
01:38:26,097 --> 01:38:28,600
<i>is beyond all human wisdom.</i>

1247
01:38:29,100 --> 01:38:31,795
<i>Oh God, my God,</i>

1248
01:38:31,796 --> 01:38:33,505
<i>do not Thou forsake me.</i>

1249
01:38:33,506 --> 01:38:37,447
<i>Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death,</i>

1250
01:38:37,448 --> 01:38:39,930
<i>I shall fear no evil,</i>

1251
01:38:39,931 --> 01:38:43,239
<i>if Thou art with me….</i>

1252
01:39:06,300 --> 01:39:08,100
What is it my daughter?

1253
01:40:51,380 --> 01:40:56,077
For it is the dawn that has come,
as it has come for a thousand centuries,

1254
01:40:56,078 --> 01:40:58,078
never failing.

1255
01:40:58,079 --> 01:41:03,490
But when that dawn will
come, of our emancipation,

1256
01:41:03,500 --> 01:41:07,000
from the fear of the bondage
and the bondage of fear,

1257
01:41:07,010 --> 01:41:10,498
why, that is a secret.
