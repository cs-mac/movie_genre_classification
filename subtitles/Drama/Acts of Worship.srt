1
00:02:22,149 --> 00:02:23,372
Coffee?

2
00:02:29,556 --> 00:02:31,447
You know what you want?

3
00:02:35,095 --> 00:02:36,952
I'll be right back.

4
00:03:14,434 --> 00:03:18,225
...libel if it's true. We've gotta tell
the client we can't do this work.

5
00:03:18,305 --> 00:03:20,998
We file this lawsuit, I swear...

6
00:03:24,378 --> 00:03:27,110
- Thank you.
- Have nice day.

7
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:30,170
- He's sleeping with Anita.
- No way. She's not even hot.

8
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,607
Like I care.

9
00:03:33,354 --> 00:03:37,553
Come on, guys. They traded
this prick for three draft picks...

10
00:03:37,633 --> 00:03:39,514
...none of them worth spit.

11
00:03:40,828 --> 00:03:43,810
Sit up straight and eat your food.
You never listen.

12
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,704
All you do is fool around.
You never take anything seriously.

13
00:03:47,784 --> 00:03:49,674
Sorry, Dad.

14
00:04:14,693 --> 00:04:16,584
Can I help you?

15
00:04:18,561 --> 00:04:22,424
How about you just turn your ass around
and get the fuck out of here?

16
00:04:24,136 --> 00:04:26,378
You just back up, there.

17
00:04:55,835 --> 00:04:58,125
<i>Do I look crazy to you?</i>

18
00:04:58,205 --> 00:05:00,861
<i>Unhinged? Maybe I am.</i>

19
00:05:00,941 --> 00:05:04,800
<i>But before you rush to judgment,
let's rewind a bit.</i>

20
00:05:25,598 --> 00:05:30,224
Which is why he's gonna choose our firm
to defend him and not some cut-rate LLP...

21
00:05:30,304 --> 00:05:32,326
...with a radio commercial
and a catchy jingle.

22
00:05:32,406 --> 00:05:35,696
<i>Women speak approximately 20,000 words a day.</i>

23
00:05:35,776 --> 00:05:38,299
Yeah, you know, some not guilty.

24
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:41,468
I want to spend an extra million
or two on that, all right?

25
00:05:41,548 --> 00:05:44,171
<i>Men, 17,000.</i>

26
00:05:44,851 --> 00:05:46,674
No, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.

27
00:05:46,754 --> 00:05:49,943
This is not what I think. This is what it is.

28
00:05:50,023 --> 00:05:54,382
Another victim of the systemic
racism inherent in the police force.

29
00:05:54,462 --> 00:05:57,251
<i>I spoke around 80,000 words a day.</i>

30
00:05:57,331 --> 00:06:01,201
...my two favorite letters: N-G.

31
00:06:01,401 --> 00:06:05,427
- Not guilty.
- <i>Words were my weapon of choice.</i>

32
00:06:06,706 --> 00:06:10,164
<i>But out of those 80,000 words
I spoke a day...</i>

33
00:06:10,844 --> 00:06:13,535
<i>...do you know how many are really important?</i>

34
00:06:14,847 --> 00:06:16,133
<i>Three.</i>

35
00:06:16,483 --> 00:06:18,472
I love you.

36
00:06:18,552 --> 00:06:19,942
Come here.

37
00:06:21,688 --> 00:06:24,553
<i>Three words total out of 80,000.</i>

38
00:06:25,825 --> 00:06:27,481
I love you.

39
00:06:27,561 --> 00:06:29,452
<i>Not a good ratio.</i>

40
00:06:49,248 --> 00:06:51,605
Frank, you were supposed
to be here a half an hour ago.

41
00:06:51,685 --> 00:06:55,008
- The place is really starting to fill up.
- I know, I know. I'm sorry.

42
00:06:55,088 --> 00:06:59,381
- I'm heading down to the garage right now.
- <i>Olivia wants to talk to you.</i>

43
00:07:02,828 --> 00:07:04,617
Hi, Daddy.

44
00:07:04,697 --> 00:07:06,687
Hi, sweetheart.

45
00:07:06,767 --> 00:07:08,922
<i>You're coming, right?</i>

46
00:07:09,002 --> 00:07:11,502
- I'm on my way.
- <i>Good.</i>

47
00:07:11,582 --> 00:07:14,338
'Cause I think you're gonna
love my performance.

48
00:07:14,418 --> 00:07:17,531
- <i>Promise you'll be here?</i>
- I promise.

49
00:07:17,611 --> 00:07:19,468
<i>I love you.</i>

50
00:07:21,881 --> 00:07:23,406
Shit.

51
00:07:26,185 --> 00:07:28,476
Wait. Wait.

52
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,485
Frank, you got a minute?

53
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,504
Okay, you've got to sign these too.
We've got to ship them out tonight.

54
00:07:57,584 --> 00:08:00,838
Luckily there was a case argued
just recently on the supreme court.

55
00:08:00,918 --> 00:08:05,198
For three reasons acquittals should have
full effect under the double jeopardy...

56
00:08:09,195 --> 00:08:12,467
Olivia, you're next.

57
00:08:46,499 --> 00:08:48,689
This is my daddy's favorite song.

58
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:51,460
He and I always sing it together.

59
00:08:58,217 --> 00:09:00,826
<i>Dream</i>

60
00:09:00,856 --> 00:09:03,392
<i>Dream, dream, dream</i>

61
00:09:03,472 --> 00:09:05,858
<i>Dream</i>

62
00:09:05,938 --> 00:09:08,142
<i>Dream, dream, dream</i>

63
00:09:13,956 --> 00:09:15,852
<i>To hold me tight</i>

64
00:09:15,932 --> 00:09:18,817
<i>Whenever I want you</i>

65
00:09:18,897 --> 00:09:21,004
<i>All I have to do</i>

66
00:09:21,084 --> 00:09:23,464
<i>Is dream</i>

67
00:09:23,544 --> 00:09:26,084
<i>Dream, dream, dream</i>

68
00:09:31,888 --> 00:09:33,702
<i>Dream</i>

69
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:35,985
<i>Dream</i>

70
00:10:00,806 --> 00:10:02,996
<i>Hi, it's Sue. Please leave a message.</i>

71
00:10:03,076 --> 00:10:05,532
Susan. Listen, I'm sorry.

72
00:10:05,612 --> 00:10:08,635
Things just got away from me at work.

73
00:10:09,015 --> 00:10:12,065
Call me back, please. I'm sorry.

74
00:11:05,103 --> 00:11:09,562
- <i>Hi, it's Sue. Please leave a message.</i>
- Sue. Listen...

75
00:11:10,444 --> 00:11:14,935
...listen, I know you're upset
with me, but please call me back.

76
00:11:15,415 --> 00:11:18,902
It's getting late, and I'm worried
about you guys, okay?

77
00:12:05,531 --> 00:12:09,222
- Mr. Valera, I'm Detective Lustiger.
- Where are they?

78
00:12:09,302 --> 00:12:12,225
Are they okay? Where are they?

79
00:12:12,305 --> 00:12:14,162
Mr. Valera.

80
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,331
Mr. Valera.

81
00:12:18,811 --> 00:12:20,702
Mr. Valera!

82
00:12:22,615 --> 00:12:25,171
We're still waiting for the forensic team.

83
00:12:25,251 --> 00:12:30,176
Frank! Frank! I can't let you
contaminate the crime scene.

84
00:12:30,256 --> 00:12:31,813
Frank!

85
00:12:42,301 --> 00:12:45,392
My baby. That's my baby.

86
00:12:45,472 --> 00:12:48,862
- That's my baby!
- Hold him back!

87
00:12:48,942 --> 00:12:51,600
Let me go. Let me go!

88
00:12:52,778 --> 00:12:55,836
Let me go! Susan!

89
00:12:57,117 --> 00:12:58,939
Let me go!

90
00:12:59,419 --> 00:13:02,877
Get him back! Get him back!

91
00:13:10,763 --> 00:13:14,087
The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.

92
00:13:14,167 --> 00:13:16,857
He makes me lie down in green pastures.

93
00:13:16,937 --> 00:13:19,192
He leads me beside the still waters.

94
00:13:19,272 --> 00:13:21,194
He restores my soul.

95
00:13:21,274 --> 00:13:25,866
He leads me in the paths of
righteousness for his name's sake.

96
00:13:25,946 --> 00:13:29,569
Yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death...

97
00:13:29,649 --> 00:13:33,542
...I will fear no evil, for you are with me.

98
00:13:42,094 --> 00:13:45,586
Chances are they'll never catch
the people who killed them.

99
00:13:46,466 --> 00:13:50,690
And even if they do catch them,
some slick-tongued defense attorney...

100
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:52,559
...will probably get them off...

101
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:57,917
...some slick-tongued defense
attorney just like you.

102
00:14:01,113 --> 00:14:04,204
I always kept my tongue quiet
while my daughter was alive...

103
00:14:04,284 --> 00:14:07,507
...but I never saw what she saw in you.

104
00:14:07,867 --> 00:14:10,644
She left her family, friends behind...

105
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:13,413
...she followed you across the country...

106
00:14:13,493 --> 00:14:15,879
...put your needs ahead of her own...

107
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:19,820
...but as long as my daughter
was happy, I was happy.

108
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,056
Now that my daughter is dead...

109
00:14:23,136 --> 00:14:25,226
...and my granddaughter...

110
00:14:26,176 --> 00:14:29,264
...I'll tell you what I think of you,
Frank Valera...

111
00:14:31,144 --> 00:14:33,167
...you're all talk.

112
00:14:33,847 --> 00:14:36,736
You make your living spinning words...

113
00:14:36,816 --> 00:14:39,275
...into meanings that are vague...

114
00:14:39,355 --> 00:14:41,975
..and hazy and unclear...

115
00:14:42,455 --> 00:14:46,656
...all just to exonerate
the scum of the earth.

116
00:14:47,026 --> 00:14:49,182
And from this moment on...

117
00:14:49,262 --> 00:14:54,721
...I do not ever want to hear
your mealy-mouthed voice again.

118
00:14:55,501 --> 00:14:57,358
Am I understood?

119
00:14:58,688 --> 00:15:01,128
- Jeff...
- I said...

120
00:15:01,558 --> 00:15:06,018
...I never want to hear your voice again.

121
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:09,905
A nod will suffice.

122
00:17:53,078 --> 00:17:56,937
<i>Without a break in the case,
all the police could do was talk.</i>

123
00:17:57,017 --> 00:17:59,806
<i>Empty words to appease. A familiar game.</i>

124
00:17:59,886 --> 00:18:02,242
Your wife's car was expertly wiped down.

125
00:18:02,322 --> 00:18:04,945
<i>My wife and daughter, murdered.</i>

126
00:18:05,025 --> 00:18:07,247
<i>Their killer still out there
roaming the street.</i>

127
00:18:07,327 --> 00:18:12,197
- Maybe they knew what they were doing.
- <i>And all anyone could do was... talk.</i>

128
00:18:13,169 --> 00:18:16,023
And there wasn't any evidence
at the crime scene, right?

129
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:18,971
Found these tiny gold fibers.

130
00:18:19,051 --> 00:18:20,928
Gold fibers?

131
00:18:21,941 --> 00:18:26,721
I don't think my wife or Olivia were wearing
anything gold that night, were they?

132
00:18:26,801 --> 00:18:30,637
- No.
- So then, that's a lead, right?

133
00:18:30,717 --> 00:18:32,243
Well...

134
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,564
...I talked to a tailor downtown.
He said it was a very common thread.

135
00:18:35,644 --> 00:18:37,512
It's not much of a lead.

136
00:18:40,192 --> 00:18:41,915
And there are still no witnesses?

137
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:44,517
None have come forward,
but we're still looking.

138
00:18:44,597 --> 00:18:48,538
That area is a notorious stomping ground
for the <i>Oreversakonya.</i>

139
00:18:48,618 --> 00:18:51,391
- What was that?
- Russian mafia.

140
00:18:51,471 --> 00:18:54,695
They have a stranglehold in that area.
It's hard to get anyone to talk.

141
00:18:55,675 --> 00:19:00,000
Would it have been the Russian mafia,
like, robbery or a carjacking or something?

142
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,603
You guys never found my wife's purse.

143
00:19:03,703 --> 00:19:07,107
Pretty violent for a purse-snatching,
don't you think, Frank?

144
00:19:08,087 --> 00:19:09,976
Or carjacking?

145
00:19:10,356 --> 00:19:12,928
- Why'd they leave the car?
- I don't know.

146
00:19:13,008 --> 00:19:17,051
Maybe something went terribly wrong
and they had to flee, I don't know.

147
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:20,313
We are exhausting all leads.

148
00:19:20,393 --> 00:19:24,090
You don't need to keep coming down here,
Frank. I'll call you if anything comes up.

149
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:28,228
I'll call you even if something doesn't,
just to keep you informed.

150
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:31,264
Detective Lustiger...

151
00:19:31,744 --> 00:19:34,165
...will you please stop texting, sir?

152
00:19:43,555 --> 00:19:45,860
Can I see the file on the case?

153
00:19:49,461 --> 00:19:51,684
Chief wants a word with you, Bill.

154
00:19:51,964 --> 00:19:54,172
Tell him I'll be right there.

155
00:19:56,969 --> 00:19:58,526
Please.

156
00:19:59,504 --> 00:20:01,094
No.

157
00:20:01,274 --> 00:20:04,784
It's confidential. It's police business.

158
00:20:05,744 --> 00:20:07,867
It is my wife and my daughter.

159
00:20:07,947 --> 00:20:11,904
Frank, I am trying to find out who
did this and to bring them into justice.

160
00:20:11,984 --> 00:20:14,207
Well, try harder. Goddamn it!

161
00:20:14,287 --> 00:20:17,377
You have any idea how often
a violent crime is committed in this country?

162
00:20:17,457 --> 00:20:21,080
- No, I...
- Every 25.3 seconds, Frank.

163
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:25,785
That means for the 25.3 minutes you sat here,
60 violent crimes have been committed.

164
00:20:25,865 --> 00:20:27,388
Really?

165
00:20:32,071 --> 00:20:33,768
You okay?

166
00:20:35,074 --> 00:20:36,964
Am I okay?

167
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:39,867
I'll never be okay.

168
00:20:40,747 --> 00:20:42,570
Mr. Valera.

169
00:20:45,384 --> 00:20:47,141
We never give up.

170
00:20:48,287 --> 00:20:49,827
Yeah.

171
00:22:34,639 --> 00:22:37,218
Kill him! Tackle him!

172
00:22:51,676 --> 00:22:54,301
Come on! Come on!

173
00:23:06,057 --> 00:23:09,697
<i>It became clear to me
that justice would never be served.</i>

174
00:23:18,103 --> 00:23:20,560
<i>I made my family a promise...</i>

175
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,664
<i>...but my words were as empty
as everyone else's.</i>

176
00:23:27,612 --> 00:23:29,671
<i>I was the guilty one.</i>

177
00:23:55,174 --> 00:23:57,865
Get him! Get him! Get him! Get him!

178
00:24:16,195 --> 00:24:18,620
<i>I'd found my form of penance.</i>

179
00:25:28,433 --> 00:25:29,656
What are you doing?

180
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:33,359
<i>My associates suggested I take some time off.</i>

181
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:37,330
<i>"Mental-health days," they called it.</i>

182
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:42,391
<i>Although I know it was really because
they didn't want me around anymore.</i>

183
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:46,591
<i>Frankly, the feeling was mutual.</i>

184
00:25:50,055 --> 00:25:53,310
- I need time.
- <i>Defending suspected criminals...</i>

185
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:56,727
<i>...was something I'd lost my taste for.</i>

186
00:26:01,933 --> 00:26:04,991
Break it up! Stop!

187
00:26:36,735 --> 00:26:41,594
I suppose you're wondering, what is a nice
guy like me doing in a place like this?

188
00:26:41,674 --> 00:26:43,965
Something like that, yeah.

189
00:26:52,015 --> 00:26:56,070
I promised I'd meet them at my daughter's
talent show the night they were killed.

190
00:26:59,124 --> 00:27:00,976
I should've been there for them.

191
00:27:01,056 --> 00:27:03,783
The last message I ever got
from my wife was...

192
00:27:03,863 --> 00:27:07,689
...a text of a video she took
of a performance I missed.

193
00:27:09,067 --> 00:27:12,115
Yeah. Gave them my word...

194
00:27:13,072 --> 00:27:14,896
...then I broke it.

195
00:27:16,625 --> 00:27:18,466
It's killing me.

196
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:23,205
Frank, you can't blame yourself
for what happened.

197
00:27:23,285 --> 00:27:25,303
Oh, believe me, I can.

198
00:27:29,087 --> 00:27:30,943
What about you?

199
00:27:31,423 --> 00:27:35,848
You're not in a police uniform, which means
you're not here to bust the fights up.

200
00:27:36,428 --> 00:27:39,575
- You follow me here or something?
- This job, Frank...

201
00:27:40,433 --> 00:27:42,894
...it's a fucking war zone out there.

202
00:27:44,103 --> 00:27:46,126
The way people feel about cops...

203
00:27:47,406 --> 00:27:51,322
...sometimes I just gotta blow off
a little steam, you know?

204
00:27:52,811 --> 00:27:55,301
Of course, if the department knew
that I sometimes mixed it up...

205
00:27:55,381 --> 00:27:57,804
...in the underground fight circuit, well...

206
00:27:58,384 --> 00:28:00,962
...wouldn't be too good
for my career in law enforcement.

207
00:28:09,761 --> 00:28:13,053
You know, I was sorry to hear that...

208
00:28:13,433 --> 00:28:16,089
...they're going to re-prioritize your case.

209
00:28:17,769 --> 00:28:19,593
What the hell are you talking about?

210
00:28:21,506 --> 00:28:25,732
Your case has been re-prioritized from
active to cold. I thought you knew.

211
00:28:26,312 --> 00:28:28,401
- Why?
- Frank, it's been a long time.

212
00:28:28,481 --> 00:28:31,971
You know, we've got no fresh leads.
I mean, it's hard.

213
00:28:32,051 --> 00:28:35,480
- The case is dead?
- No, it's not dead, it's just...

214
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,203
...cold.

215
00:28:37,283 --> 00:28:40,583
Those are fucking semantics, and you know it.

216
00:28:40,663 --> 00:28:44,950
You know, this is a way of twisting words
around. Believe me, I know about it.

217
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:47,842
I've made a lot of money doing that.

218
00:28:53,172 --> 00:28:57,198
Look, I'll stay on top of Lustiger.
You know, try and keep it in his mind.

219
00:28:59,894 --> 00:29:01,736
Talk is cheap?

220
00:29:16,194 --> 00:29:18,052
Hey, mister.

221
00:29:20,952 --> 00:29:24,759
You looking for... company tonight?

222
00:29:26,534 --> 00:29:29,007
I can make you feel good if you want.

223
00:29:30,009 --> 00:29:32,885
You could do anything.

224
00:29:32,965 --> 00:29:35,569
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

225
00:29:37,081 --> 00:29:39,505
What are you doing out here?

226
00:29:39,785 --> 00:29:42,810
You're too young to be here. How old are you?

227
00:29:44,456 --> 00:29:47,483
Answer me. How old are you?

228
00:29:47,993 --> 00:29:49,515
Thirteen.

229
00:29:49,895 --> 00:29:51,150
Thirteen.

230
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:52,753
Shit.

231
00:29:58,502 --> 00:30:00,259
Get your ass over here.

232
00:30:00,339 --> 00:30:02,261
I'm sorry, buddy.

233
00:30:02,341 --> 00:30:05,298
She thought you were somebody else. Let's go.

234
00:30:05,378 --> 00:30:08,389
Please, sir. This girl is someone's daughter.

235
00:30:28,166 --> 00:30:30,437
<i>If I could have been
listening more closely...</i>

236
00:30:30,517 --> 00:30:32,736
<i>...if I would have been listening at all...</i>

237
00:30:32,816 --> 00:30:35,229
<i>...I probably would have heard it.</i>

238
00:32:11,499 --> 00:32:13,910
<i>Finding the book was a sign.</i>

239
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:17,997
<i>I had been punishing myself
for their deaths...</i>

240
00:32:18,677 --> 00:32:21,333
<i>...but I wasn't the one who killed them.</i>

241
00:32:21,613 --> 00:32:24,238
<i>I had been punishing the wrong person.</i>

242
00:34:33,311 --> 00:34:37,124
Meditations <i>was written
nearly 2,000 years ago...</i>

243
00:34:37,666 --> 00:34:40,873
<i>...and became the basis for stoicism...</i>

244
00:34:41,353 --> 00:34:42,806
<i>...which believed...</i>

245
00:34:42,886 --> 00:34:46,678
<i>...that the best indication
of an individual's philosophy...</i>

246
00:34:46,758 --> 00:34:48,615
<i>...was not what he said...</i>

247
00:34:49,293 --> 00:34:51,351
<i>...but rather what he did.</i>

248
00:34:52,831 --> 00:34:57,717
<i>Stoics would take a vow of silence
in order to focus on a specific task.</i>

249
00:34:58,337 --> 00:35:01,894
<i>It is why I took my own vow
not to be broken...</i>

250
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:05,399
<i>...until I avenged my wife
and daughter's murders.</i>

251
00:36:51,982 --> 00:36:54,273
<i>Within days after I stopped talking...</i>

252
00:36:54,353 --> 00:36:57,609
<i>...my sense of hearing
had drastically improved.</i>

253
00:36:57,989 --> 00:36:59,279
<i>You see?</i>

254
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:03,600
<i>Good things do happen when you
shut the fuck up for a minute or two.</i>

255
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,892
Hey.

256
00:39:34,462 --> 00:39:36,303
Nice ride, my man.

257
00:39:38,048 --> 00:39:41,110
But unfortunately you're in our territory,
so how about you just give me...

258
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:44,483
...your wallet and car keys,
and we'll call it even.

259
00:39:48,526 --> 00:39:51,151
<i>Could these be the men who killed them?</i>

260
00:39:52,997 --> 00:39:55,512
<i>A carjacking gone terribly wrong.</i>

261
00:40:08,813 --> 00:40:10,681
Come on!

262
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:20,446
Fucking dumb piece of shit!

263
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,045
Please.

264
00:41:37,318 --> 00:41:41,962
<i>I wanted to search his face
for the slightest hint of recognition.</i>

265
00:41:43,911 --> 00:41:46,333
<i>He had no idea who they were.</i>

266
00:43:07,925 --> 00:43:09,815
Are you okay?

267
00:44:10,955 --> 00:44:12,846
My name is Alma.

268
00:44:15,325 --> 00:44:18,316
I'm an E.R. nurse over at Mercy.

269
00:44:18,396 --> 00:44:21,801
I volunteer at the local homeless shelter.

270
00:44:22,833 --> 00:44:24,788
And you are?

271
00:44:30,307 --> 00:44:32,163
Are you okay?

272
00:44:32,943 --> 00:44:35,736
Do you understand me? <i>¿Me comprende?</i>

273
00:44:35,816 --> 00:44:37,703
Can you hear me?

274
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:42,224
Do you remember anything about yesterday?

275
00:44:43,284 --> 00:44:45,545
About how you got here?

276
00:44:48,358 --> 00:44:50,715
I was coming home from the hospital...

277
00:44:50,795 --> 00:44:53,928
...and I found you lying in the road.

278
00:44:54,008 --> 00:44:56,888
So I helped you over here.

279
00:44:57,168 --> 00:45:01,527
You were really out of it,
and that's when I discovered...

280
00:45:02,207 --> 00:45:04,195
...you'd been shot.

281
00:45:04,675 --> 00:45:07,299
Let me check it out. Okay?

282
00:45:07,779 --> 00:45:11,703
You're lucky. The bullet only grazed you...

283
00:45:11,783 --> 00:45:14,808
...so the wound was pretty easy to dress.

284
00:45:16,754 --> 00:45:18,278
Hey.

285
00:47:20,011 --> 00:47:23,434
<i>Why would Susan roll down</i>
<i>her window in the rain?</i>

286
00:47:24,014 --> 00:47:25,138
<i>Why?</i>

287
00:47:34,458 --> 00:47:35,882
Hi.

288
00:47:39,346 --> 00:47:41,755
You left this at my house.

289
00:47:46,349 --> 00:47:49,363
Your address is on your driver's license.

290
00:47:51,108 --> 00:47:54,133
Plus, I have to re-check your wound.

291
00:48:12,029 --> 00:48:13,920
You were very lucky.

292
00:48:23,357 --> 00:48:25,814
You don't have me fooled, you know.

293
00:48:25,894 --> 00:48:27,750
I know you can talk.

294
00:48:30,547 --> 00:48:33,571
Last night, after I bandaged you up...

295
00:48:34,551 --> 00:48:36,409
...you talked in your sleep.

296
00:48:37,354 --> 00:48:41,864
And if you can talk in your sleep,
you can talk when you are awake.

297
00:48:47,281 --> 00:48:50,556
You kept saying two names over and over...

298
00:48:51,736 --> 00:48:53,626
...Sue and Olivia.

299
00:49:09,619 --> 00:49:11,791
Your wife and daughter?

300
00:49:24,267 --> 00:49:26,292
I am so sorry.

301
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,364
Was their killer ever caught?

302
00:50:17,741 --> 00:50:20,113
I know that area very well.

303
00:50:21,758 --> 00:50:24,217
I drive through it on my way to work.

304
00:50:31,518 --> 00:50:33,743
Let me know if you need any help.

305
00:51:09,506 --> 00:51:12,261
<i>A transportation security dog.</i>

306
00:51:14,317 --> 00:51:18,536
<i>Trained to sniff out the smallest of scents
in the most densely populated areas...</i>

307
00:51:18,616 --> 00:51:20,640
<i>...with military precision.</i>

308
00:51:27,641 --> 00:51:31,317
<i>I wonder if my new friend
could fill in some blanks.</i>

309
00:52:46,236 --> 00:52:50,428
<i>The homeless encampment I had found...
if anyone was there that night...</i>

310
00:52:50,508 --> 00:52:52,997
<i>...they would have been the perfect witness.</i>

311
00:52:53,077 --> 00:52:55,535
<i>Maybe even the perfect killer.</i>

312
00:54:39,782 --> 00:54:41,505
No fever.

313
00:54:41,585 --> 00:54:43,474
You are going to be okay, honey.

314
00:54:44,854 --> 00:54:48,287
- The doctor will come soon.
- Thank you very much.

315
00:54:54,331 --> 00:54:56,354
You have something for me?

316
00:54:57,034 --> 00:54:58,924
I told you it was done.

317
00:55:01,704 --> 00:55:03,761
Nobody is done.

318
00:55:04,341 --> 00:55:06,198
Not until I say so.

319
00:55:09,846 --> 00:55:11,738
I'll be seeing you soon.

320
00:55:31,234 --> 00:55:34,558
Yeah, I know this spot.
It's Mr. Shivers' place.

321
00:55:34,638 --> 00:55:37,661
Sometimes on my way home
from the night shift...

322
00:55:37,741 --> 00:55:40,064
...I see him around here...

323
00:55:40,144 --> 00:55:41,968
...always smoking.

324
00:55:44,013 --> 00:55:47,138
But I've never interacted with him.

325
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:49,474
Actually, I never saw his face.

326
00:55:50,154 --> 00:55:53,276
So I wouldn't be able to I.D. him for you.

327
00:55:53,356 --> 00:55:55,247
I'm sorry.

328
00:55:56,759 --> 00:55:59,283
But I heard he works sometimes...

329
00:55:59,363 --> 00:56:01,788
...at the local diner as a fry cook.

330
00:56:04,568 --> 00:56:06,592
We don't know his real name.

331
00:56:08,104 --> 00:56:10,745
People at the shelter call him Mr. Shivers...

332
00:56:10,825 --> 00:56:13,065
...because he gives them the creeps.

333
00:56:14,912 --> 00:56:18,828
They say he has this really violent attitude.

334
00:56:36,082 --> 00:56:37,923
Thanks, Frank.

335
00:56:59,856 --> 00:57:03,014
You and I need to talk. Where are my drugs?

336
00:57:03,094 --> 00:57:05,082
I don't want to do this anymore.

337
00:57:05,162 --> 00:57:06,684
Listen.

338
00:57:07,364 --> 00:57:11,088
You will do as I tell you, understood?

339
00:57:11,168 --> 00:57:13,392
- Yes.
- Shut up!

340
00:57:46,109 --> 00:57:47,960
Those guys...

341
00:57:49,005 --> 00:57:51,229
...they came into the E.R....

342
00:57:51,829 --> 00:57:53,626
...about a year ago...

343
00:57:55,745 --> 00:57:57,970
...forcing me to pay protection.

344
00:57:59,816 --> 00:58:02,440
Have me steal drugs for them.

345
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:04,375
From the hospital, you know.

346
00:58:04,455 --> 00:58:07,280
Oxy, codeine, fentanyl.

347
00:58:08,658 --> 00:58:11,350
But the other day I told them I was done.

348
00:58:16,699 --> 00:58:19,054
They're gonna kill me for this, Frank.

349
00:58:21,070 --> 00:58:22,928
What am I going to do?

350
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:53,586
Nobody ever accused me of being able to cook.

351
00:59:55,732 --> 00:59:58,856
But I figured that one breakfast...

352
00:59:58,936 --> 01:00:01,360
...was the least I could do to thank you.

353
01:00:09,145 --> 01:00:13,026
You know, I've been thinking
about the guy you are looking for...

354
01:00:13,106 --> 01:00:14,671
...Mr. Shivers.

355
01:00:14,751 --> 01:00:19,132
Like I said, I've never worked
with him directly at the shelter, but...

356
01:00:21,924 --> 01:00:24,348
...but he had this cough...

357
01:00:24,678 --> 01:00:28,100
...a hacking cough you'd recognize anywhere.

358
01:00:50,653 --> 01:00:53,243
<i>Do I still look crazy to you?</i>

359
01:00:53,323 --> 01:00:56,046
<i>Unhinged? Like a maniac?</i>

360
01:00:56,126 --> 01:00:58,150
<i>All of the above?</i>

361
01:01:00,063 --> 01:01:02,453
<i>Yeah. You're probably right.</i>

362
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:05,240
<i>But at least now, you understand why.</i>

363
01:01:14,177 --> 01:01:16,333
<i>He recognized them.</i>

364
01:01:16,413 --> 01:01:18,010
<i>But...</i>

365
01:01:18,882 --> 01:01:21,538
<i>...there was no death in this man's eyes.</i>

366
01:01:21,618 --> 01:01:23,596
<i>He wasn't their killer.</i>

367
01:01:26,022 --> 01:01:28,680
I saw what happened that night.

368
01:01:43,172 --> 01:01:45,385
It was a cop.

369
01:01:47,176 --> 01:01:52,237
I was there. I saw the whole thing.

370
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:18,965
Mommy!

371
01:02:33,090 --> 01:02:35,214
Mommy! Mommy!

372
01:02:49,906 --> 01:02:52,763
<i>He killed them in the warehouse.</i>

373
01:02:52,843 --> 01:02:54,665
<i>What could I do?</i>

374
01:02:56,245 --> 01:02:59,144
I've got enough trouble already.

375
01:03:00,116 --> 01:03:03,743
I don't need no more trouble with cops.

376
01:03:13,062 --> 01:03:15,022
The purse...

377
01:03:15,102 --> 01:03:16,920
<i>...got left behind.</i>

378
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,658
I took the money from it, and I...

379
01:03:19,738 --> 01:03:23,229
...I got rid of it. I needed the money, man.

380
01:03:25,842 --> 01:03:27,867
I'm sorry, man.

381
01:03:29,215 --> 01:03:31,023
I'm sorry.

382
01:03:32,752 --> 01:03:34,895
Open the door!

383
01:03:35,185 --> 01:03:37,469
Come on! Open this door now!

384
01:03:38,989 --> 01:03:41,246
Open this door right now!

385
01:03:51,301 --> 01:03:54,960
I just want to see my son.
Take me to see my son.

386
01:03:56,773 --> 01:03:59,030
Get your hands off me!

387
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:03,033
Hey! I didn't do nothing, goddamn it!

388
01:04:03,113 --> 01:04:05,836
What'd I tell you?
Why don't you just let me go, man?

389
01:04:05,916 --> 01:04:07,671
- Cuff him!
- Motherfuckers!

390
01:04:07,751 --> 01:04:10,140
- Calm down!
- You need some help?

391
01:04:10,220 --> 01:04:11,942
- Fuck you!
- Calm down!

392
01:04:12,022 --> 01:04:13,913
Keep moving!

393
01:04:45,488 --> 01:04:49,244
<i>I wanted to narrow my pool
of suspects by finding out...</i>

394
01:04:49,324 --> 01:04:53,450
<i>...which officers were on duty
the night Shivers witnessed the killings.</i>

395
01:04:53,530 --> 01:04:55,051
<i>And of those officers...</i>

396
01:04:55,131 --> 01:04:59,424
<i>...which one had been assigned
to patrol that particular district.</i>

397
01:05:05,575 --> 01:05:08,601
<i>I was surprised to discover a familiar face.</i>

398
01:05:10,249 --> 01:05:12,037
<i>Could it really be him?</i>

399
01:07:20,646 --> 01:07:23,402
- Show him what you got!
- Hit him!

400
01:07:50,673 --> 01:07:54,131
<i>I followed Payton
for seven whole days and nights.</i>

401
01:07:55,411 --> 01:07:58,904
<i>I chased him as my demons were chasing me.</i>

402
01:08:00,950 --> 01:08:03,307
<i>I even alternated between cars...</i>

403
01:08:03,387 --> 01:08:05,676
<i>...as to not arouse suspicion.</i>

404
01:08:06,556 --> 01:08:08,845
<i>Night after night...</i>

405
01:08:09,125 --> 01:08:11,149
<i>...day after day.</i>

406
01:08:13,195 --> 01:08:15,768
<i>All the while wondering...</i>

407
01:08:15,848 --> 01:08:20,641
<i>...if this man truly was the one who
had killed my wife and daughter...</i>

408
01:08:21,037 --> 01:08:22,961
<i>...then why?</i>

409
01:08:24,190 --> 01:08:26,015
<i>So I kept watching...</i>

410
01:08:28,110 --> 01:08:30,335
<i>...trying to find an answer...</i>

411
01:08:31,530 --> 01:08:33,388
<i>...a sign...</i>

412
01:08:34,217 --> 01:08:36,275
<i>...or maybe a mistake.</i>

413
01:11:13,912 --> 01:11:17,335
- Found these tiny gold fibers.
- Gold fibers?

414
01:11:27,122 --> 01:11:28,712
Yes, officer?

415
01:11:28,792 --> 01:11:31,316
Can you please pull over on the next road?

416
01:11:40,386 --> 01:11:41,965
Mommy!

417
01:11:43,666 --> 01:11:45,196
<i>Mommy!</i>

418
01:12:58,814 --> 01:13:01,738
- <i>The case is dead?</i>
- <i>It's not dead, it's just cold.</i>

419
01:13:01,818 --> 01:13:06,144
This is a way of twisting words around.
I made a lot of money doing that.

420
01:16:10,138 --> 01:16:12,364
Now you know why I did it, Frank.

421
01:16:15,311 --> 01:16:18,136
Some creep you put back on the streets...

422
01:16:19,615 --> 01:16:21,640
...killed my little girl.

423
01:16:25,253 --> 01:16:27,485
Twelve years old, Frank.

424
01:16:29,491 --> 01:16:31,581
Murdered by a guy...

425
01:16:31,961 --> 01:16:34,245
...who should have been behind bars.

426
01:16:52,214 --> 01:16:54,435
This is where they died.

427
01:16:56,318 --> 01:16:58,577
Your wife was a fighter, Frank.

428
01:17:03,325 --> 01:17:05,150
But your little girl...

429
01:17:08,263 --> 01:17:10,687
...well, she was screaming...

430
01:17:11,367 --> 01:17:13,823
...crying for her daddy...

431
01:17:13,903 --> 01:17:15,760
...to come and save her.

432
01:17:18,306 --> 01:17:20,164
But you didn't.

433
01:17:21,844 --> 01:17:23,669
Where were you, Frank?

434
01:17:26,331 --> 01:17:28,189
Where were you?

435
01:20:37,906 --> 01:20:42,033
<i>I wanted nothing more than to kill
the human monster before me...</i>

436
01:20:45,663 --> 01:20:49,507
<i>...but that would make me no better than him.</i>

437
01:20:51,069 --> 01:20:54,443
<i>Because the greatest stoic
of them all has said...</i>

438
01:20:54,523 --> 01:20:58,816
<i>"...the best revenge
is to be unlike your enemy."</i>

439
01:21:51,045 --> 01:21:52,895
What do you think about the verdict?

440
01:21:52,975 --> 01:21:56,439
<i>The evidence against Officer Strode
was overwhelming.</i>

441
01:21:56,519 --> 01:21:58,841
<i>The department is very happy
with the verdict.</i>

442
01:21:58,921 --> 01:22:02,179
<i>There is nothing worse than a bad cop.</i>

443
01:22:03,025 --> 01:22:07,085
- <i>Detective, were there other cops involved?</i>
- <i>No, there's no evidence supporting that.</i>

444
01:22:17,672 --> 01:22:20,495
<i>Justice had been served.</i>

445
01:22:22,060 --> 01:22:24,469
<i>I had tried to make things right.</i>

446
01:22:26,514 --> 01:22:29,974
<i>But I knew that nothing I did
would ever bring them back.</i>

447
01:22:34,389 --> 01:22:36,814
<i>And I could never go into the past...</i>

448
01:22:37,993 --> 01:22:40,819
<i>...to be there for them, like I promised.</i>

449
01:22:43,565 --> 01:22:45,588
<i>If I could...</i>

450
01:22:45,668 --> 01:22:48,824
<i>...I would tell my daughter
that she was right...</i>

451
01:22:49,204 --> 01:22:51,829
<i>...I loved her performance.</i>

452
01:22:52,558 --> 01:22:57,099
<i>And I would tell them both the words
that still matter the most...</i>

453
01:22:57,179 --> 01:23:00,420
<i>...among the thousands we speak every day.</i>

454
01:23:01,150 --> 01:23:02,990
I love you.
