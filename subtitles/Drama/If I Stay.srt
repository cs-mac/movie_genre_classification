1
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,100
At the age of 26,
Ludwig Van Beethoven went deaf,

2
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,460
ending his career as a
successful concert pianist.

3
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,100
But determined not to let a
little thing like his hearing

4
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,740
end his music career,

5
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,500
my pal Ludwig became a composer.

6
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,340
Turned out the new gig suited him.

7
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,140
It's like that old saying,

8
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,020
"Life is what happens when
you're busy making other plans."

9
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,500
Take my dad.

10
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,220
When my little brother,
Teddy, was born,

11
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,860
he quit his band to get a real job.

12
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,900
But then he fell in
love with teaching.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,980
Now he spends
his days in the mosh pit

14
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,500
that is high school English class.

15
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,380
Or my mom, a riot girl
who found her calling

16
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:35,900
as a part-time travel agent
and a full-time supermom.

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,740
These days, she only
moshes with Teddy.

18
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,944
Scooch over, dude.

19
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,260
And then there's me.

20
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,220
I thought I knew where I was going.

21
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,380
I thought I had it all mapped out.

22
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,180
Turns out, I had no idea.

23
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,620
Your coffee, maestro.

24
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,060
- Thank you.
- Me too. I want some!

25
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,260
No way, dude.

26
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,620
You don't give crack to somebody
who's already on speed.

27
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,380
Don't worry,
we switched him to decaf.

28
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,820
- Whoa. As long as you don't switch me.
- No, baby,

29
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,626
that would be child abuse.

30
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,110
Hey, did you see this?

31
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,620
I got a Google Alert
about it yesterday.

32
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,460
It's the most we've seen
of him in a few months.

33
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,505
I know.

34
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,620
Oh, my God, is he really
opening up for The Shins?

35
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,180
Yeah. When they play
in Portland tonight.

36
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,300
That's huge.

37
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,868
Yeah, I know. It's kind of crazy.

38
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,140
Everything he's ever wanted's
actually coming true.

39
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,500
I know you guys haven't
been talking much lately.

40
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,900
Mom, I really don't want
to talk about it, okay?

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,820
I'm just saying that if you miss
each other it's okay to reach out.

42
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,940
Okay!

43
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,820
Come on. If you guys
want a ride, we got to go.

44
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,580
Now let's update you
on the snowstorm and school closures.

45
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,740
Baby, turn that up.

46
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,820
Portland and Clackamas counties

47
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,020
are now calling for a snow day.

48
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,540
All schools in Portland and Clackamas
districts will be closed for the day.

49
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,140
Yes! That means no school, kids.

50
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,500
Well, ain't that a bitch?

51
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,102
School's out forever!

52
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,820
Did you really just
quote Alice Cooper?

53
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,700
My God, son, have I
taught you nothing?

54
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,260
Let's go make a snow monster.

55
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,020
We can try. It looks like it's not
really sticking out there, though.

56
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,940
You guys are all playing
hooky without me?

57
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,500
It's not hooky if it's a snow day.

58
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,780
So not fair.

59
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,860
- Life isn't fair.
- That is true.

60
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,340
But sometimes you got to,
like, noodge it a little.

61
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,820
It'd be bad to go to
work with this cough,

62
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,627
spreading my germs around.

63
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,580
You know how when you meet someone

64
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,820
and they just already are the
person they're meant to be?

65
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,060
That was Adam.

66
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,700
Nobody outside Portland
had ever heard of his band.

67
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,540
But he already was somebody.

68
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,791
Everybody knew who he was.

69
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,220
Me?

70
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,185
Not so much.

71
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,260
What class was this?

72
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,060
Advanced Composition.

73
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,380
What's she doing?

74
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,900
She's more advanced.

75
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,300
Adam. What's up?

76
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,621
I think everyone left.

77
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,340
Let's get some lunch.
I am Starvin' Marvin.

78
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,660
Oh, and, um, by the way,

79
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,140
that Adam rocker dude was
totally checking you out.

80
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,940
Adam Wilde saw me geeking out?

81
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,100
He saw you blissing out
and he was into it.

82
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,380
No, he isn't "into it," Kim.

83
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,020
Uh, yeah, he is, Mia.

84
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,420
He's way into you.

85
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,180
Do not take his picture, Kim.

86
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,623
I'm not an amateur.

87
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,700
You're welcome.

88
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,940
Over the next couple of weeks

89
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,067
I noticed Adam hanging around
while I was practicing my cello.

90
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,947
You're Mia.

91
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,020
- Yeah.
- Good.

92
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,380
I just wanted to clear that up.

93
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,660
There were rumors.

94
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,820
I'm Adam.

95
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,460
I kno... Um...

96
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,860
Hi.

97
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,980
Wow.

98
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,940
Yo-Yo Ma much?

99
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,020
Kinda.

100
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,260
What's the deal with that?

101
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,500
Is that, like, street or something?
Yo-Yo Mama?

102
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,620
It's Chinese.

103
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,620
And don't mock the master.

104
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,260
- It's blasphemous.
- I'm sorry, my bad.

105
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,430
Hey, I got some tickets
to see a cellist.

106
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,740
Really?

107
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,502
Yeah. You interested?

108
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,140
You're asking me on a date?

109
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,060
Yeah. Well, a friend of the family
had the tickets and can't go.

110
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,743
Anyhow, it's this Friday.
I could pick you up.

111
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,580
What?

112
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,660
You can't hide in that
rehearsal room forever.

113
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,500
It's too late.

114
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,784
I see you.

115
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,180
Hey.

116
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,740
I'm Kim.

117
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,466
Hi.

118
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,871
Okay. I'll see you guys later.

119
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,581
Bye.

120
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,380
Oh, my God!

121
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,460
What?

122
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,500
I told you he was into you.

123
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,540
No, no. He just had a question
about classical music and...

124
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,346
Okay.

125
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,020
Better be nice to you or else

126
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,780
I'll crush him like the bug he is.

127
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,100
God, all right, we get it.
You're in love! Go away!

128
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,140
You got two types of girls
in this world, Mia.

129
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,700
Girls who have boyfriends
in high school...

130
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,780
And girls like us who
wait till college.

131
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,144
So much happier.

132
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,980
I'm totally off the hook.

133
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,660
What are we doing today, hmm?

134
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,620
We can go the farm, visit
Henry, Willow and the baby?

135
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,540
Stop by my folks' place
for a late lunch?

136
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,980
Mia, you gonna come with us?

137
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,060
I don't know.

138
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,820
There's this tricky part
of the Beethoven sonata

139
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,980
that I've really gotta nail,

140
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,460
and, well, the letters
were mailed on Friday.

141
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,580
Juilliard.

142
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,700
The audition was 2 months ago,

143
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,580
but I can still feel
it in my fingers.

144
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,060
Okay, this is painful to watch.

145
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,660
Look, who knows what time the mail's
even gonna be delivered today?

146
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,340
Come on, you got to come with us.

147
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,460
Come on, baby. Pretty soon
you're gonna be off to college,

148
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,820
no matter where you're going.

149
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,340
How many snow days are we gonna
be able to spend together?

150
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,420
Are you really playing
the guilt card right now?

151
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,740
We'll let you pick the music.

152
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,340
And bribery.

153
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,140
Honey, guilt and bribery are
the glue that have held

154
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,260
parents and teenagers
together for generations.

155
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,740
Don't fight tradition.

156
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,260
Fine.

157
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,980
Boom!

158
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,381
I am a passenger

159
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,500
And I ride and I ride...

160
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,940
I thought you said
I'd pick the music.

161
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,900
Oh, yah. She's right, Teddy.
Fire up the jams, sister.

162
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,340
Let's hear something old-school.

163
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,980
How 'bout I kick out a few tunes

164
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,780
from our favorite
Austrian melody maker,

165
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,300
Franz Schubert.

166
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,060
Not that old-school.

167
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,380
Iggy Pop! Iggy Pop!

168
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,620
Teddy, you can listen
to Iggy on your iPod.

169
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,660
But nothing after 1978.

170
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,940
- You understand me, young man?
- Yes, sir.

171
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,580
Well, I choose Ludwig Van Beethoven.

172
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,140
Surprise.

173
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,980
I've always wondered if

174
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,140
Mom and Dad were disappointed

175
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,220
that I didn't turn
out more like them.

176
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,020
I tried to. I mean, Mom and I
went to all of Dad's shows.

177
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,420
Dad's band was called Nasty Bruises.

178
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,660
Embarrassing, I know.

179
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,660
They were what you might
call "big" in our town.

180
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,900
And for a while, everyone
thought they might get bigger.

181
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,671
That was my preschool.

182
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,665
But then one day in second grade...

183
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,780
I wanna play it.

184
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,380
Cellos are crazy expensive.

185
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,260
So, I borrowed a crappy
one from school.

186
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,260
Mom and Dad found a student
from a local college to teach me.

187
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,660
And I rehearsed day and night.

188
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,989
I couldn't get enough.

189
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,020
I love her.

190
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,820
But I'm about ready to
stab my eyeballs out.

191
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,020
This is exactly why I
could never procreate.

192
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,780
Amen, sister.

193
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,300
I loved the order.

194
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,660
The structure.

195
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,060
But what really hooked me was
that feeling I got in my chest.

196
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,989
It's like my heart was
beating with the cello.

197
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,265
Dude.

198
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,624
She's been at it since
this afternoon.

199
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,980
You want me to tell her to
hang it up for the night?

200
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,706
No.

201
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,100
You go in there you'd probably
get clubbed with a bow.

202
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,509
I wouldn't risk it.

203
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,260
I wonder where she gets that from.

204
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,460
Ah, naw, guys play
music for two reasons.

205
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,740
To get laid and because
they got rage.

206
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,220
But mostly to get laid.

207
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,471
Well, that's probably
not her motivation.

208
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,903
No. Exactly.

209
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,220
She's not doing it to get anything.

210
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,300
She's just doing it out of pure...

211
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,748
We made that.

212
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,940
The next day,
Dad came home with a present.

213
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,350
A cello of my very own.

214
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,460
Isn't it amazing how life
is one thing and then,

215
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,660
in an instant,
it becomes something else?

216
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,300
Like here I am, Mia.

217
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,500
The girl who thinks about
the cello and Adam

218
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,627
and whether a letter is
waiting for me at home.

219
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,270
And just like that...

220
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,220
Get some cribbing in there.
Support those columns.

221
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,420
We need a full
spinal immobilization.

222
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,067
Hello?

223
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,100
Our resources are good right now.

224
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,260
Excuse me!

225
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,180
Sir, excuse me?

226
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,620
Hello?

227
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,221
Mom.

228
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,626
Teddy!

229
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,865
Dad!

230
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,300
We have
oreshortening in this left leg.

231
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,901
Yeah.

232
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,980
Do you wanna
get a tube in her now?

233
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,180
Just grab the Ambu bag for now.

234
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,270
No!

235
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,580
Wake up!

236
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,511
Wake up.

237
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,110
Wake up.

238
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,068
Go, 1, 2, 3.

239
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,740
Let's move.
Her Glasgow Coma's at a 7.

240
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,580
Tell Portland to
have a trauma team ready.

241
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,620
Glasgow Coma? Why do
you need a trauma team?

242
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,180
One female, late teens, critical,
en route to Portland now.

243
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,260
- One 8-year-old male, conscious.
- Mom! Dad!

244
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,380
Teddy!

245
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,391
Let's go, Demetri.

246
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:34,070
Hang in there, baby.
We'll be in Portland soon.

247
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,500
You okay?

248
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,620
No.

249
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,620
You wanna hit up my closet?

250
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,302
Your closet's terrifying.

251
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,340
I don't even wanna go.

252
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,260
Come on, he's just a guy, Mia.

253
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,060
Yeah, but he's the first guy I've
ever gone on a maybe-date with

254
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,420
and I don't know whether to wear
date clothes or casual clothes or...

255
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,500
Just wear, you know,
something you feel good in.

256
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,740
And if this Adam dude doesn't see how
amazing you are, then he's a total...

257
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,860
- Shithead.
- Yeah.

258
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,108
Oh, I think I'm gonna puke.

259
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,068
Better before than during.

260
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,580
You must be Adam.

261
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,100
Uh, yeah. I am, yeah.

262
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,420
Nice threads.

263
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,740
Come on in. I'm the old man, Denny.

264
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,020
I know. You were in
Nasty Bruises, right?

265
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,980
Oh, wow,
you're impressing me already.

266
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,100
Well, I have your CDs.

267
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,740
You're the one.

268
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,660
They make great coasters,
right? Come on.

269
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,940
Adam's here!

270
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,100
Is that Mia?

271
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,900
Yeah. That's our
little rock and roll.

272
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,940
She was Nasty Bruises'
original groupie.

273
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,100
Oh, no. Is he telling
you old war stories?

274
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,701
Hey.

275
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,020
- We should probably go.
- 'Kay.

276
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,460
'Kay, you kids be careful out there.

277
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,740
I hear it gets pretty
wild at the symphony.

278
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,940
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

279
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,621
Bye.

280
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,860
Your parents seem pretty cool.

281
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,020
So they tell me.

282
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,180
Seriously, I respect any musician

283
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,140
who just leaves it all
on the stage like that.

284
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,260
She was awesome.

285
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,060
Thought you were a little
bored there in the beginning.

286
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,660
No. That snoring was
the lady next to me.

287
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,944
I loved every minute of it.

288
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,909
All right, Hall,
so what's your story?

289
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:22,466
How did parents like yours end
up having a kid like you?

290
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,943
- Well, I was certainly bred to be a rocker.
- Mmm-hmm.

291
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,660
But I have this theory that
I was switched at birth.

292
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,069
Okay. That explains it.

293
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,310
No, but seriously.

294
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,860
I don't know,
I've always kind of felt like this

295
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,020
Martian in my family.

296
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,588
I don't look like
either of my parents.

297
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,900
My mom's this tough chick
and my dad's all outgoing

298
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,300
and I went and chose
Beethoven and the cello.

299
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,220
When I was 8,
I saw this old video

300
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,740
of the Ramones playing
"I Wanna Be Sedated".

301
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,140
And it felt like my head exploded.

302
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,860
And I was like, "I have to
learn to play the guitar."

303
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,589
So, my uncle hooked me
up with this old Fender.

304
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,182
Yeah, that thing saved my life.

305
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:30,022
You didn't really get those tickets
from a family friend, did you?

306
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,500
That was 2 weeks
of pizza delivery tips.

307
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,340
Why?

308
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,700
Why me?

309
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,790
Because I like to watch you play.

310
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,548
You go to another place.

311
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,705
And you're beautiful.

312
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,710
You get this crease in
your forehead right there.

313
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,831
Why do I have this feeling you're
about to mess up my entire life?

314
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,701
A little mess never hurt anybody.

315
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,620
A week later, Adam invited
me to see his band play.

316
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,180
Liz, Mia. Mia, Liz.

317
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,227
Ah, I got to change the tube
on this amp. I'll see ya in there.

318
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,506
Okay.

319
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,263
1, 2, 3, 4!

320
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,784
Whoo!

321
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,820
I wasn't lookin' for something

322
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,071
To sink my teeth into

323
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,820
I didn't know what I wanted

324
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,548
I never do

325
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,700
I want what you have

326
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,304
I want what you have now

327
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,420
Give it to me

328
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:12,141
Do you make it look so good
'cause you know what's up?

329
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:20,060
Do you know exactly what to do?

330
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,900
I want what you have

331
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,540
I want you have now

332
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,380
Give it to me

333
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,380
I want what you have

334
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,940
I want you have now

335
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:39,060
Give it to me

336
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,910
Thank you and good night.

337
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,340
So, what other bands are you into?

338
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,500
Um...

339
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,580
Classical mostly.

340
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,860
Right on. I love classic rock.

341
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,660
Mia!

342
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,820
Hey. Are you okay?

343
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,540
Kinda miscommunicating with people.

344
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,700
The usual.

345
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,940
Yo, Adam. After-party at Darren's.
You comin'?

346
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,420
Yeah. Yeah, we're in. Yeah.

347
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,500
- You in?
- I have my curfew.

348
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,420
- Curfew?
- Yeah.

349
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,021
Okay.

350
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,065
Well, we'll set you loose early.

351
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,780
Thanks for slummin' it with us tonight.

352
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,780
Yeah. No problem.

353
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,543
Yo, Adam, just kiss her and let's go, man.

354
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,302
Come on.

355
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,900
We're cool, right?

356
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,260
- You and me?
- Yeah.

357
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,100
We're cool.

358
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,300
Hey, you finally got to meet Liz.

359
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,026
Yeah.

360
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,225
You two have a lot in common.

361
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,907
You ever, like,

362
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,420
hooked up, or...

363
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,260
Actually, I'm glad
you brought that up.

364
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,060
We do have a lot in common.

365
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,940
For instance, we're both

366
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,746
into girls.

367
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,389
She's with Astrid.

368
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,140
Oh, wow!

369
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,220
Go, Astrid.

370
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,266
And now we've got
that out of the way.

371
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,060
I'm bummed you can't
stay out with us tonight.

372
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,264
Yeah, I know.

373
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,420
Mia, just go. Have fun.

374
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,740
- Mom?
- Kat! Get away from the window.

375
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,705
- Dad?
- Sorry.

376
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,820
Like, your mom and dad are
cool with you staying out,

377
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,070
but you don't want to, or...

378
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,300
Um...

379
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:41,791
Look, I think I'm coming
down with something.

380
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,107
Right.

381
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:49,620
Yeah, well, just give me a
shout when you get over it.

382
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,020
I'll see you around.

383
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,980
- Hey, Adam.
- Mom, get back inside.

384
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,620
We always do these stragglers'
dinners on Sunday.

385
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,260
You should come by some time.

386
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,660
Thanks.

387
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,625
Maybe I'll check it out.

388
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,624
You know, that was wrong
on so many levels.

389
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,220
What? She shouldn't be scared
to hang out with those guys.

390
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,700
They're us.

391
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,660
Exactly.

392
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,228
- Okay, bring her out.
- Behind.

393
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,141
No palpable
deformities at this time.

394
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,586
Go, go, go.

395
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,460
What do we got here?

396
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,580
Collapsed lung, broken ribs.

397
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,660
Looks like 3.

398
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,740
Abrasions to the legs, face.

399
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,220
Brain contusions,
full extent unknown.

400
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,700
And an internal bleed.

401
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,060
Rest of the family's on the way in.

402
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,700
Ultrasound, X-ray, 12-chem,
type and cross-match.

403
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,700
Let's get the RT down here, please.

404
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,871
On my count. 1, 2, 3.

405
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,100
Hey, excuse me, I need
to check on my family.

406
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,101
It's Kathleen Hall,
Dennis Hall and Theodore Hall?

407
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,830
- Good to go.
- Hello?

408
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,100
Hey, I was trying to look at that.

409
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,580
Ruptured spleen, we need to move.

410
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,340
We're taking Mia
Hall into operating room one.

411
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,420
All right, let's get her in there.

412
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,980
We got to remove the spleen,
drain the lung

413
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,260
and figure out what's
causing the bleed.

414
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,100
If she wants to live,
she better start fighting.

415
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,700
Start fighting? How am I
supposed to start fighting?

416
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,060
Someone just talk to me, please!
Just help me.

417
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,780
Okay, let's go, folks.

418
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,666
Her sutures.

419
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,300
Arterial line set.

420
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,460
Okay, let's get it cleaned up.

421
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,820
Your cut-down
tray's almost prepped.

422
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,460
Let's go, let's go.

423
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,140
Thank you.

424
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,620
GCS still looks high.

425
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,824
Am I gonna die?

426
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,710
Is that what this is?

427
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,740
Here's the secret, baby.

428
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,300
You control this whole thing.

429
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,620
If you live, if you die,
it's all up to you.

430
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,871
So, whatever fight you got in you,
you got to pull it out now.

431
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,260
Call the blood bank.
I need 2 units of O neg.

432
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,620
Keep two on hold.

433
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,220
I think we're gonna
need a lot more than that.

434
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,140
Let's see if we can
track down her relatives, please.

435
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,180
Right away, sir.

436
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,386
One of her parents is
on their way to OR 4 now.

437
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,467
Dad?

438
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,660
We just have
to relieve the swelling.

439
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,342
For a guy who was in such a bad
car wreck, he really lucked out.

440
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,104
Hey, Mia! Look what
I found loitering out front.

441
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,305
Do we want him?

442
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,951
I was hungry.

443
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,980
Well, I'm glad you came.

444
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,860
Because you're hungry and we
have food for you to eat, or...

445
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,064
Well, food to eat is my favorite.

446
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,180
Out of my way, people. I just worked
a double and I need to feast.

447
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,220
I'm eatin' dim sum for a twosome.

448
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,380
Hey, what's up, Willow?

449
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,020
Welcome, Adam. It's nice to see ya.

450
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,380
Play your cards right,
we might make you a regular.

451
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,700
- Okay, Mom, we got it.
- Thanks.

452
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,586
Come on.

453
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,180
Okay, so who is it?
Bobby Schayer from Bad Religion.

454
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,380
- Tim Leitch from FEAR.
- Tim Leitch from FEAR.

455
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,180
- The guy from Dead Moon.
- Andrew Loomis.

456
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:24,340
And the guy from
The Wipers, Sam Henry.

457
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,620
So if you think about it,

458
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:29,220
Portland's kind of like a haven for
legendary punk drummers, right?

459
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,420
That's a good point.

460
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,900
Mia, your man knows
his punk rock history.

461
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,626
Thanks.

462
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,860
Ow!

463
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,580
Oh, my God! Oh, God,
something just stung me.

464
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,260
Who does that?

465
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,380
A bee?

466
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,260
- Babe, are you sure it's a bee?
- Oh, yeah.

467
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,420
We got to get the stinger out.

468
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,580
No, we're not doing that.

469
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,387
Trust me, this is this only
thing I learned in Boy Scouts.

470
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,460
Got it.

471
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,580
Way hotter than tweezers.

472
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,260
Stand down, woman.
You're already knocked up.

473
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,060
You know, you should
get stung more often.

474
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,900
I'm sorry to say that's
the furthest we've gotten

475
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,229
since our first date.

476
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:17,702
Yeah. Maybe we should
do something about that.

477
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,027
I like where your head's at, Hall.

478
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,980
Adam?

479
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,460
I'm coming up.

480
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,140
No, you cannot come up.

481
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,900
I have something to tell you.

482
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,582
Besides, it's too late.
I'm already climbing.

483
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,590
Oh, God.

484
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,340
Okay. Um...

485
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,500
Oh! Schroeder.

486
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,101
Um...

487
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,621
Hey.

488
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,461
Hey.

489
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,860
I thought you went home.

490
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,791
I got lost.

491
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,460
Did you actually learn that
beesting thing from the Boy Scouts?

492
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,860
No, I totally made it up.

493
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,620
I just really wanted
to suck your hand

494
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,660
in front of all your
parents' friends.

495
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,469
What did you want to tell me?

496
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,991
Today was awesome.

497
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,300
You guys are like a real family here.

498
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,900
I don't think I've ever seen
one of those up close.

499
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,740
It's impressive.

500
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,740
Yeah, well, trust me,
it hasn't always been that way.

501
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,060
When I was a kid,
things were so chaotic.

502
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,700
They'd be up late, so I was up late.

503
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:14,110
And Dad would be on the
road for weeks at a time.

504
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,830
They didn't really get it
together until Teddy was born.

505
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,671
What about you?
What are your parents like?

506
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,707
They're not really a part of my life.

507
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:30,180
Honestly, I can't remember them ever
being in the same place for a meal.

508
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,940
And if you want to track down the
old man, that's gonna take a while.

509
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,020
So...

510
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,260
Adam.

511
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,387
No, it's cool. I'm good
at being mostly alone.

512
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,784
But that's the thing,

513
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,389
you're not alone.

514
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,065
Not anymore.

515
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,901
Wait.

516
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,100
I need to take it slow, okay?

517
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,145
I love slow.

518
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,980
And meet

519
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,180
Me there

520
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:25,071
Bundles of flowers,
we wait through the hours of cold

521
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,780
Winter shall howl at the walls

522
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:36,749
Tearing down doors of time

523
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:46,265
Shelter as we go...

524
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,020
Is there enough room?

525
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,660
A little more underneath, please.

526
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,388
- Suture.
- There we go.

527
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,100
The surgery's been
going on for hours,

528
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,350
and they're nowhere near done.

529
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,700
I need to find my family.

530
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,620
Kim?

531
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,060
Kim, wait!

532
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,460
I came here as soon
as I could. What happened?

533
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,020
- Is everyone okay?
- We don't know.

534
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,460
Gran. Gramps.

535
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:28,301
We need to find out
what the hell's going on here.

536
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,220
Excuse me, my name is Estelle Hall.

537
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,700
Our son, Denny Hall,
his wife, Kathleen,

538
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,460
and their two kids got
in a car accident

539
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,980
this morning and we'd like to
find out how they're doing.

540
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,820
- Yes, of course.
- Mr. and Mrs. Hall?

541
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,100
I'm Liddy. I'm your social worker.

542
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,060
I've just been assigned your case.

543
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,220
I am so sorry for what's happened.

544
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,060
Now, I haven't been able to
speak to anyone's doctors yet,

545
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:53,660
but I do know that Mia and
Dennis are still in surgery.

546
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,980
Most likely they'll be
heading to the ICU.

547
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,060
There is no information on
Kathleen in the system yet.

548
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,540
But Theodore...

549
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,500
- Teddy?
- Yes, Teddy.

550
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,140
He was conscious when he arrived.

551
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,900
He's getting a CAT scan now.

552
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,420
Why don't you make yourselves
as comfortable as you can

553
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,620
and I will come and
get you the second

554
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,660
I have any new information. Okay?

555
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,147
Thank you.

556
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,220
Hey, Henry and Willow
are on their way.

557
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,260
And I tried calling Adam and
left a couple messages,

558
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,100
but I haven't heard anything yet.

559
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,180
There are two types
of people in this world, Kim.

560
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,860
Those who like real coffee,

561
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,780
and those who like froufrou
drinks with ridiculous names.

562
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,420
Um, wow. You know,
I'm not ashamed to be

563
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,700
a cinnamon-spice chai latte lover.

564
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,780
Thank you very much.

565
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,620
Yeah, well, it kind of smells like
Christmas threw up in your mug.

566
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,260
Fine by me.

567
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,340
So, Adam.

568
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,740
Is it awesome?

569
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,540
It feels big.

570
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,940
It's crazy. I can't eat,
I can't sleep.

571
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,220
But...

572
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,940
For starters, I hate
going to his shows.

573
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,300
Do you not like his music, or...

574
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,580
No, I love his music.

575
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,460
He writes these amazing songs, and...

576
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,020
I don't know, when he comes off stage

577
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,700
I just wanna, like,
lick the side of his face.

578
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,620
Oh, baby.

579
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,460
But when I hang out with his crowd,

580
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,780
I just feel like...

581
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,380
Like a fish out of water?

582
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,820
Like a fish on Mars.

583
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:09,140
Come on, it's not his friends
you're afraid of, it's him.

584
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:12,140
I mean, he's older, he's in a band.

585
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,061
All those girls surrounding him.
I mean,

586
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,300
it's scary. I get it.

587
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,220
What if it doesn't work out?

588
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,460
You gonna be there to
pick up the pieces?

589
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,425
Every last one of 'em.

590
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,660
But if it gets serious,

591
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,060
you better not turn into
one of those girlfriends

592
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,185
who only speaks in
the first person plural.

593
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,500
"We love the winter."

594
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,590
"We never use deodorant."

595
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,500
"We only like quinoa."

596
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,740
If you ever turn into one of
those girls, I'mma gonna shoot ya.

597
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,260
If I ever turn into
one of those girls,

598
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,430
I'mma gonna give you the gun.

599
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,260
Hey. Mom?

600
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,980
Who's the toughest,
hottest rocker chick you can think of?

601
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,500
- Debbie Harry.
- Okay, cool.

602
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,500
Or Patti Smith or Joan Jett.

603
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,340
Lucinda Williams,
even though she's country.

604
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,660
Kim Gordon.

605
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,660
What's this,
a social studies project?

606
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,548
No, it's for Halloween.

607
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,620
Tonight, with Adam.

608
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,063
Oh, you're going as the rocker chick.

609
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,980
I don't even wanna go.

610
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,380
Bunny rabbit.

611
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,780
What's up?

612
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,580
I wanna dive into Adam's world.

613
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,140
You know, I wanna
be like his friends.

614
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,220
But what if I can't pull it off?

615
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,980
The whole messy punk rocker
live-in-the-moment thing.

616
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,820
Then you return all the clothes
to my closet in the morning

617
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,660
and go about your life.

618
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,900
Baby, it's one night.

619
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,500
Right?

620
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,900
I mean, I know it's not your thing,

621
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,821
but why not try out messy and
in-the-moment and see how it feels.

622
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,829
You might be surprised.

623
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,151
Hey, Adam.

624
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,860
Whoa, Hall. I didn't
think you had it in you.

625
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,220
Whoa, yourself.

626
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,106
I'm Beethoven.

627
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,860
Ludwig.

628
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,189
Come on, let's go.

629
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,385
What's up, Adam?

630
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,780
Debbie Harry always said,

631
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,140
"A shot before showtime
does the trick." So...

632
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,300
Bottoms up.

633
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,060
Oh, I'm good.

634
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,185
Okay. Well,
it's there if you want it.

635
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,740
Yo, Adam. We're goin' on.

636
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,540
Okay. I've gotta go do my set.

637
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,820
No running off with some me wannabe.

638
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,626
I'll try.

639
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,300
Have fun.

640
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,500
Oh, my God, Mia.

641
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,380
You look amazing.
Did you get this in Seattle?

642
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,380
Hey. Wanna bone?

643
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,700
You're frickin'
embarrassing yourself.

644
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,740
Come on, at least give
me your bone number.

645
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:38,662
Ladies and gentlemen, Willamette Stone!

646
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,380
Happy Halloween.

647
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,186
Whoo!

648
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,580
Are you coming?

649
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:06,380
I've gotta say I'm
feelin' better than I should

650
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:11,065
Don't got a lot, but I
know life is always good

651
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,260
Oh, come on over

652
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:15,460
Bring some friends
who have the time...

653
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,820
Mia, you have to come.

654
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,020
Wait.

655
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:21,021
I'm feeling fine...

656
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,620
Hey.

657
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,500
'Scuse me. Move it.

658
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:30,180
So tell me now,
are you in or are you not?

659
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:34,900
I don't want to move the world
I just wanna sit on top

660
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,060
Let's raise a glass

661
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,620
Here's to the best and to the worst

662
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:44,942
Here's to the feelings that
you just can't put to words

663
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:59,100
We got tonight we got tonight

664
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,420
For the years

665
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,620
For the night

666
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,060
I'm feelin' good

667
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,460
I'm feeling high

668
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,951
I'm feelin' like I've never felt

669
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:18,220
We got tonight we got tonight

670
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,267
For the years, for tonight...

671
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,460
Bye, Adam. Bye, Rocker Mia.

672
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,700
Bye, you guys.

673
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,347
Bye.

674
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,541
So...

675
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,420
Do you like me like this?

676
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,340
At last, you finally figured it out.

677
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,380
No, come on.

678
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,660
I mean, do you like
me how I am tonight?

679
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,060
You know what I liked?

680
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,780
I liked how into the show you were.

681
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,180
How you actually wanted to dance

682
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,620
and hang outwith us
riffraff afterwards.

683
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,140
That was cool.

684
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:54,346
Yeah, but do you like me better,

685
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,351
you know,

686
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,940
- like this?
- Better than what?

687
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,660
Better than the normal Mia.

688
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:04,780
You know, with the hair and
the makeup and the clothing.

689
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:09,430
Mia, I don't give a shit
about your clothes.

690
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,340
Don't you get it?

691
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,980
The you you are now is the same
you I was in love with yesterday.

692
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,787
The same you I'll be
in love with tomorrow.

693
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,709
Can we go somewhere?

694
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,661
Yeah.

695
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,706
Wow.

696
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,420
What is this place?

697
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,785
It's an old boatworks shed.

698
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,060
One day, me and the band
are gonna fix it up

699
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,867
and we're gonna rehearse
and record here.

700
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,460
It's perfect.

701
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,225
So are you.

702
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,060
Adam.

703
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,707
Yeah?

704
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,671
I've never...

705
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,540
Just think of it like we're
playing music together.

706
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,780
Adam, that doesn't make any sense.

707
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,064
Yes, it does.

708
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,780
All right, well,
take your jacket off.

709
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,541
Okay.

710
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,781
All right.

711
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,670
So we have four strings.

712
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,220
We have the C string

713
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,020
and G,

714
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,826
D

715
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,627
and A.

716
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,380
And if I were to play glissando,

717
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,823
it'd feel like this.

718
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,620
And if I were to play pizzicato,

719
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,551
it'd feel like this.

720
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,020
And if I were to play forte.

721
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,060
I know forte.

722
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,822
I ain't never gonna shut you out!

723
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:28,191
Everywhere I'm looking now

724
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:32,387
I'm surrounded by your embrace

725
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,865
Baby, I can see your halo

726
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:40,341
You know you're my saving grace...

727
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,780
Intensive Care Unit.

728
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,586
Yeah, she is.

729
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,782
How are we, beautiful?

730
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:01,060
I told 'em that I don't
wanna leave you.

731
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,503
I'm not gonna let you
out of my sight.

732
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,226
We have another one from
the accident, Nurse Davis.

733
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,741
Dad. Thank God.

734
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,700
Oh, my God, George.

735
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,100
Is he going to be okay?

736
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,620
We're updating his chart right now.

737
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,100
The doctor will be in to
speak with you shortly.

738
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,701
Dad?

739
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,460
Where is he?
Where'd you guys take him?

740
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,860
I'll just finish writing the
orders and then she's all yours.

741
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,420
Girl's been through the wringer.

742
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:33,300
Yeah. And this is the
easy part. Accident like that?

743
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,460
Mom was DOA. Dad died on the table.

744
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,820
Poor kid's waking up an orphan.

745
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,501
If she wakes up.

746
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,700
Mom.

747
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,060
Dad!

748
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,302
I'm getting you!

749
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,186
Whoo!

750
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,420
I love you.

751
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,867
Teddy.

752
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,310
1814...

753
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,421
Teddy.

754
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,300
Hey, little man.
Look at this room.

755
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,060
You got the best place in the joint.

756
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,020
Are you okay?

757
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:09,580
That's right. You just get some rest.

758
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,860
I'm not going anywhere.

759
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,940
Oh, Gran. Hey, I just got here.

760
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,140
They're saying he's
through the worst of it.

761
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,900
They were assigning his room,
so, I thought I'd come here

762
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,460
before I checked in on Kat and Den...

763
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,425
They didn't...

764
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,151
Oh, my God!

765
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,060
Excuse me.

766
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,900
You're mine now, Teddy.

767
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,027
And no matter what,
I will never leave you.

768
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,110
We're gonna make it.

769
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,429
Listen, I need to do something.

770
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:58,389
But I promise you, Teddy.

771
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,580
Adam.

772
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,705
You came.

773
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,260
Listen. You can't let Teddy
grow up without a family.

774
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:34,020
You have got to fight.

775
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,860
You can do this. You have to do this.

776
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,020
Mia!

777
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,580
- Excuse me.
- Sir!

778
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,340
- Mia!
- Adam.

779
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,460
Mia!

780
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,061
Mia!

781
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,824
Being with Adam
was like learning to fly.

782
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:01,311
It was exciting and scary,
all at the same time.

783
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,227
That spring was a magical time.

784
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:10,140
Adam's band was playing bigger clubs

785
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,380
and festival in different cities.

786
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:16,420
Once he graduated, they started
getting booked even more.

787
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:19,671
By the fall, record labels
were taking notice.

788
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,620
People were taking notice of me too.

789
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:26,460
I was the first high school
student ever invited

790
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:30,064
to perform solo at the
college's fall recital.

791
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:35,460
And even though Adam was away a lot,

792
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:38,900
when he was in town,
we spent all of our time together.

793
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,540
I can't believe I'm stuck
at school for another year.

794
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,540
It'll go by fast.

795
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,100
You still thinking of
applying to Lewis & Clark?

796
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:49,580
Yeah, of course. I mean,
they have a great music program.

797
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,860
I need someplace with financial aid.

798
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:55,060
Maybe we can live around
the corner from each other.

799
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:59,551
Or we could shorten the commute
and get a place together.

800
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,586
Really?

801
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,386
That actually sounds kinda perfect.

802
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:28,065
- Kid's good.
- Whoo!

803
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:33,140
Sir, I told you
you can't go in there.

804
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,140
What do you mean I can't go
in there? This is bullshit.

805
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:36,700
Sir, you can't be in there.

806
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,420
You need to calm down.

807
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:39,700
ICU visitations are restricted

808
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,700
to immediate family only.
Are you family?

809
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,660
All right, you got me.
I'm not family.

810
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,180
Come on, just let him in!

811
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:48,066
Do I need to call security?

812
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,901
Adam.

813
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,820
Juilliard?

814
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,940
Just look on the computer like you do

815
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,100
and see what it takes
to get in there.

816
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,180
They say it's the best there is.

817
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,100
Of course it is,
but it's across the country.

818
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:14,421
You know, and Lewis & Clark has an
amazing performance studies program.

819
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:18,389
Besides, my whole life is here.

820
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:35,060
Dad, can I ask you a question?

821
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:36,420
Always.

822
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,545
Do you ever miss being in your band?

823
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,180
What brought this on?

824
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:45,340
You always say that you left your
band to become a better dad.

825
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:48,100
But you were a great dad
when you were in the band.

826
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:51,060
You didn't have to give up something
you loved so much just for us.

827
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:54,180
No, baby, I didn't give anything up.

828
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,540
I played that adventure out,

829
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:58,140
and then it was time for a
new adventure with you guys.

830
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,180
And sometimes you
make choices in life,

831
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:04,068
and sometimes choices make you.

832
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,540
Does that make any sense?

833
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,820
Yeah. I mean,

834
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:11,340
I think that the cello was
a choice that made me.

835
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,226
There you go.

836
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:32,140
Do you think the band
would ever relocate?

837
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,340
No. Why?

838
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:34,660
I don't know.

839
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:36,940
To see someplace new.

840
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,666
Maybe New York.

841
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,703
I can't imagine. Portland's
where we're from, you know?

842
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:45,667
Oh, yeah.

843
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:52,940
I gotta tell you something.

844
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,702
I have to listen to what
you have to tell me.

845
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:02,068
I'm going to buy all of these albums.

846
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,980
Whoa. The whole 3 bucks?

847
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:07,309
Slow down, big spender.

848
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,100
Whoo!

849
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:31,860
Whoa, Mom. Seriously,
that just makes me more nervous.

850
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:33,620
Sorry. Just ignore me.

851
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,300
Yeah. Just pretend we're not here.

852
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,500
Dad, honestly, how was that one?

853
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,100
I thought it was fantastic, Mia.

854
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,460
You say that about everything.

855
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,940
Because you're awesome.
They have to give you an audition.

856
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,580
Yeah, but you don't understand.

857
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:46,140
This is Juilliard.

858
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:47,620
This isn't just some punk album

859
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:50,580
where you can throw music at a
wall and hope it sounds all right.

860
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:52,181
Whoa.

861
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,500
I'm sorry.

862
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,340
I really didn't mean that.

863
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,860
This is pointless.

864
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:02,110
I'm not good enough.

865
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,742
I thought the last one was amazing.

866
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,661
Really?

867
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,340
I think I can do better.

868
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,385
Then let's do it.

869
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,100
Okay.

870
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,660
Yeah. Let's do it.

871
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,340
I miss you every time you go.

872
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:40,580
It'll just be a few days. Maybe more.

873
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:44,540
Well, I know you guys are
gonna kill it at City Limits.

874
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:45,660
Are you sure you can't come?

875
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,660
I'm pretty sure I can fit
you in my guitar case.

876
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:52,231
I would, but I got school.

877
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:53,580
Wow.

878
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,060
Never thought I'd hear that again.

879
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:57,020
- Come on man, we gotta hit the road.
- Okay.

880
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:05,540
- I'll be back before you know it.
- Okay.

881
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:08,060
- Come on. We gotta go.
- We're bringing him back, all right?

882
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,220
- Bye.
- Have fun.

883
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:11,946
We roll.

884
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:23,100
So what's the whatty-what
from Austin? Hear from Adam?

885
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,300
No. I called him,
but I haven't heard back.

886
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:28,580
It's fine. I mean, he's slammed.

887
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:31,060
Yeah, life on the road.

888
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:33,344
Don't give me that face.

889
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:34,740
Mmm!

890
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:36,705
Speaking of the devil.

891
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:37,900
Hello?

892
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:38,940
Hey, babe.

893
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,260
So, you all rich and famous now?

894
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:41,460
Not yet.

895
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:43,340
But Merge Records made
an offer to sign us.

896
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,780
It's been crazy.

897
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:47,260
Shut up. That's amazing, Adam.

898
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:49,340
Yeah, they're throwing
us a party right now.

899
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,100
Well, I miss you.

900
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,780
Dude! You got champagne

901
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,586
all over my phone!

902
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,581
Hello?

903
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:54,668
Waiting for the rejection

904
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:58,060
It comes in waves and
it feels like a throb

905
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,981
You wanted only the ending

906
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:04,311
But what you got was much too long

907
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:07,260
I can't be you, you know

908
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:10,340
My heart is underground

909
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:13,220
When I believe it was different

910
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:15,660
I believe we could turn it...

911
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,421
Wait.

912
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,227
Sorry.

913
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,786
Mia, wait.

914
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:26,380
Sorry, I didn't see ya there.

915
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:28,420
No worries. Just bringing
food for you guys.

916
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:30,060
Oh, cool. Thanks.

917
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,700
We're just gettin' ready
for tomorrow night.

918
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,300
It's gonna be a total homecoming.

919
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:36,300
It's our first gig in town
since we got signed.

920
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:37,901
Adam.

921
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:39,821
Yeah?

922
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:42,830
I applied to Juilliard.

923
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,740
- What?
- Yeah,

924
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:47,420
it's this amazing school.

925
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,863
Yeah, I know what Juilliard is.

926
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:52,260
Well, it was just on a whim.

927
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:54,140
Isn't it in New York?

928
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:55,420
Yeah.

929
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,340
Well, why didn't you tell me?

930
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:58,380
Well, I tried

931
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:01,860
but I figured, why tell
you until it was real?

932
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:04,060
Okay. So why you telling me now?

933
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,740
Well, I got an audition.

934
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:08,308
In San Francisco.

935
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,541
Wow.

936
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,220
Wow.

937
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:14,629
Juilliard. Mia, that's...

938
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,184
Way to go. That's cool.

939
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:19,860
Yeah, well, I won't get in.

940
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,580
But it's kind of a big deal

941
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,511
that I even got an audition.

942
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:26,108
Most people don't.

943
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:30,830
Well, Yo Mama better
watch his back. Right?

944
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:52,260
I can't get you out of my mind

945
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:57,780
I can't get you out of my mind

946
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:01,380
The homecoming concert was different

947
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:03,780
than any show the band had played.

948
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:08,226
They were tighter, better,
more confident than ever before.

949
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:12,620
And Adam seemed,

950
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:15,905
well, like he was becoming
a full-blown star.

951
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:35,500
I can't get you out of my mind

952
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,660
They're really good.
I've been following them.

953
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,500
Thanks. Thanks for coming.

954
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:48,020
Did you like the show?

955
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:49,860
Good.

956
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,060
- Thanks, guys.
- Aw!

957
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:54,140
Hey.

958
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,780
You guys were insanely good up there.

959
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,620
Yeah, well, I'm glad
you could make it.

960
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,540
Of course I made it.

961
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:02,020
- A-bomb.
- Hey, man!

962
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:03,500
- I can't believe you came!
- What's goin' on, bro?

963
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:05,660
- Tight set tonight.
- Could I get your autograph?

964
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,300
Yeah, sure.

965
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,265
Oh, wow. Okay.

966
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:10,620
It says Willamette Stone.

967
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,900
Yeah. I can see that.

968
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,184
There you go. This is cool.

969
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:25,740
If you're so bored you have to read,

970
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:28,820
maybe you should've just stayed home.

971
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:32,020
I'm just trying to get
some homework done.

972
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:33,580
And researching what phrase

973
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:36,626
I'm gonna have tattooed
over my left boob.

974
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:39,940
What's all this?

975
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:41,060
We got booked last-minute to do

976
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:42,500
a string of shows in Seattle.

977
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:45,023
We gotta leave tonight, so...

978
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:47,260
For how long?

979
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:48,380
I don't know. Like a week?

980
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:49,700
10 days?

981
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,340
It's hard to say.

982
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,500
Yeah, but we had plans.

983
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,260
Remember? For my birthday dinner?

984
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:57,703
Oh, right. Shit. Sorry.

985
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:00,420
Well, it's fine. I just
wish you would've told me.

986
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,510
What, like you told
me about Juilliard?

987
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,220
And for the record, I didn't
even hear about the tour

988
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:07,580
until tonight right
before the show, so...

989
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,420
So that's what "Glad you could
make it" was all about?

990
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:10,860
That's why you're so pissed at me?

991
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,060
Why would I be pissed about
you going to a school

992
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,260
3,000 miles away?

993
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:16,900
I'm not going there, Adam.
It's just an audition.

994
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,420
Which you didn't even
tell me about, Mia!

995
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,260
And besides, this isn't
about Juilliard.

996
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:23,020
This is about you
ditching on our plans.

997
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:24,746
- You're a liar.
- Whoa!

998
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:28,420
Screw you, Adam! I haven't
ditched out on anything.

999
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:30,100
Am I crazy, or did you say that

1000
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:33,021
us getting a place together
would be perfect? Huh?

1001
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,140
- It's...
- No, you know what?

1002
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:36,980
It's fine.

1003
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:38,740
Whatever.

1004
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:39,940
What? You get to follow your dreams,

1005
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:42,500
but I can't follow mine unless
I have your permission?

1006
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:44,020
And I just have to sit
here and wait around,

1007
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:46,460
hoping that you'll come
home every few weeks?

1008
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:47,540
How is that fair?

1009
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:49,860
You lied to me, Mia. We had plans.

1010
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:51,780
One minute, it's one thing.
The next minute, it's the other.

1011
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,020
I grew up with that shit, okay?

1012
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:55,349
I don't need it.

1013
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:57,500
Even if I do go to Juilliard,

1014
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,900
we can figure it out.

1015
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,140
Baby, we can text and we can Skype...

1016
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:03,580
Skype? Skype?

1017
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:04,900
Jesus, Mia! Have you ever even

1018
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,500
had a long-distance relationship?

1019
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:08,060
It's bullshit.

1020
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:10,980
Okay? It's like dating a ghost.

1021
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:12,980
But Skype, it solves
everything right?

1022
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:14,180
You know, you're so naive, man.

1023
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:15,700
You don't know shit about the world.

1024
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,380
I can't believe you
just said that to me.

1025
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:18,900
What, you want me to
write it down for you?

1026
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,780
Adam! Sorry, dude, but we gotta jet

1027
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:24,462
if we wanna make it to
the motel before sunup.

1028
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:27,660
No! No. You cannot
leave me like that!

1029
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,340
Why didn't you tell me?

1030
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:32,750
Maybe because I am
terrified of losing you!

1031
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:39,666
You know what? You do your thing.
I'm gonna do mine.

1032
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:44,660
Fine, but for the record,
you're the one who's getting in the van.

1033
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:46,220
Yeah, whatever.

1034
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:21,740
Mr. and Mrs. Hall?

1035
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:23,341
Yes.

1036
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:26,700
So, Mia's still unconscious.

1037
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:29,140
The respiratory therapists
are going to run some tests

1038
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:32,260
to see when they can wean
her off the ventilator.

1039
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,100
So, that's good news.

1040
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:36,260
If she can breathe on her own.

1041
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:39,700
With comatose patients,
the first 24 hours are critical.

1042
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:41,460
If she shows any
signs of awareness...

1043
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:43,420
- Adam.
- I'm sorry. I gotta go.

1044
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:55,501
Woke up this morning...

1045
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:13,300
Looked up this morning

1046
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:19,191
Saw the roses full of thorns...

1047
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:29,060
The food was good but the
service is a little, you know...

1048
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:31,380
Well, I'm sorry.
It's just the way things are.

1049
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:33,903
That's not necessary.

1050
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:35,780
When are we gonna open presents?

1051
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:37,300
- Mia?
- That's gonna be fun!

1052
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:38,460
Yeah, you wanna do that?

1053
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:40,391
Yeah, sure.

1054
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:46,547
I've gone all around

1055
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:53,230
Till there's nothing left to say

1056
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:03,789
Wrote it all down

1057
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:10,508
Into something that couldn't be said

1058
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:27,140
I thought you were
supposed to be, uh,

1059
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:29,020
in Seattle.

1060
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:31,180
No show tonight so I just

1061
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:33,305
thought I'd drive down for the day.

1062
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,020
What's that?

1063
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:45,220
It's a replica.

1064
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:47,780
Of Jolari Hall in San Francisco.

1065
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:49,980
Where you'll be
auditioning for Juilliard.

1066
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:51,900
That's the ceiling.

1067
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,980
I put it up there.

1068
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:55,580
It's intense.

1069
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:57,700
Yeah. I figured,

1070
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:59,020
you know, if you
look at it every night

1071
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:01,941
it wouldn't seem so scary
when you get there.

1072
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:07,109
What do you want, Adam?

1073
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:09,420
Mia, I'm sorry.

1074
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:12,220
- I know, I suck.
- No, no.

1075
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:14,660
You can't just disappear
from my life like that

1076
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:16,580
and pop back into it
whenever you feel like it.

1077
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:18,540
I know. It's just,

1078
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:21,940
the people in my life have a
habit of disappearing on me

1079
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:23,540
and when you started making plans...

1080
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:26,142
You're not gonna lose me.

1081
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:30,223
Adam, I love you.

1082
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:34,023
But these last few days

1083
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:36,220
have been brutal.

1084
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:37,860
I know.

1085
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:39,985
I know. For me too.

1086
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:49,991
Happy birthday.

1087
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:53,580
Well, at least I know
the wrapping's yours.

1088
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:55,545
Shut up. And just open it. Come on.

1089
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,707
It's a cello and a guitar.

1090
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:06,905
Do you get it?

1091
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:31,181
God, I hate you.

1092
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:49,620
When did you know you were good at playing music?

1093
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:50,700
Oh, I dunno.

1094
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:53,060
Come on.

1095
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:55,628
What was, like, the moment?

1096
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:59,263
Actually, there was one night.

1097
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:02,468
When we first started playing out.

1098
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:06,260
Right before the show, Liz talked
me into going to the liquor store

1099
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:08,828
and getting her a Red Bull.

1100
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,830
So I go in and

1101
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:16,864
There's this drunk dude
buying a bottle of Jack.

1102
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:21,463
And I realize it's him.

1103
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:24,749
It's my old man.

1104
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:27,700
And I just

1105
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:29,825
stop cold.

1106
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:34,380
And he just looks right at me

1107
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:36,505
and walks out.

1108
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:39,304
No idea who I was.

1109
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:43,505
Shit, Adam.

1110
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:47,700
Then that night,
I played like I was on fire.

1111
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:50,620
I don't know if I thought I was good.
I just..

1112
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:53,826
Knew that
nothing else mattered.

1113
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:56,420
Till now.

1114
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:58,431
Till you.

1115
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:11,585
When I play,

1116
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:14,660
I kind of picture

1117
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:17,388
myself inside the cello.

1118
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:20,420
It's like my little house.

1119
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:22,181
Really?

1120
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:26,900
Actually, no.

1121
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,900
I'm totally just in it for the guys.

1122
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,501
Oh.

1123
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:34,740
- I got you, didn't I?
- Yeah.

1124
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:36,341
Yeah.

1125
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:03,864
How am I supposed to
find the strength to stay?

1126
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:07,905
What would it feel like
to wake up an orphan?

1127
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:11,780
To never smell Dad cooking pancakes?

1128
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:16,226
To never stand next to Mom quietly
talking as we do the dishes?

1129
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:19,909
But how could I go?

1130
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:25,180
The nurse said I control
this whole thing.

1131
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:27,980
If I live, if I die.

1132
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:30,070
It's all up to me.

1133
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:34,345
And that terrifies me
more than anything else.

1134
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:40,980
Mia Hall.

1135
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:43,111
Good luck.

1136
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:09,700
Thanks for driving me, Gramps.

1137
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:11,825
I mean, that was...

1138
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:15,901
Thank you.

1139
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:17,781
Mia.

1140
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:22,260
I just wanted to tell you that

1141
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:24,100
I watched your audition.

1142
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:26,145
From backstage.

1143
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:27,380
I wasn't too sure

1144
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:29,660
if that cello was gonna
make it out alive.

1145
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:31,620
I know. I didn't know I had it in me.

1146
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:33,267
Well, you do.

1147
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:34,460
You were fearless.

1148
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:37,188
You played your guts out up there.

1149
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:38,901
Mia.

1150
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:42,380
You've got something special.

1151
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:44,340
Your dad had it too,

1152
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:46,500
but I never told him.

1153
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:49,785
I never made too much
fuss about his music

1154
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:52,660
and I don't wanna make the
same mistake with you.

1155
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:54,380
If those Juilliard
people don't take you,

1156
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:55,860
they are damn fools

1157
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:58,701
because what you did
up there was magic.

1158
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,545
Thank you, Gramps.

1159
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:21,825
I spend these hollow nights

1160
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:25,146
All alone

1161
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:32,150
Safe from the looking glass

1162
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:35,824
Which you kept home

1163
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:41,980
I saw the sea and knew

1164
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:46,426
It was a mirage

1165
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:52,460
It wasn't even so

1166
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:56,348
I played the odds

1167
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:00,700
I never wanted to go

1168
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:03,302
And now I'm letting you know

1169
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:05,340
I just wanted to feel

1170
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:10,740
The life in me

1171
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:17,020
Oh, hey! You're back.

1172
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:19,580
That was a really
beautiful song, Adam.

1173
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:21,705
It's gettin' there.

1174
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:23,540
How'd it go?

1175
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:25,300
Did you kill the audition?

1176
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:28,100
Are they gonna let you in on a full scholarship?

1177
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:30,460
I did all right, I guess.

1178
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:32,140
But it's kinda like

1179
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:33,620
playing to statues.

1180
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:36,020
Oh, come on. I bet you
did better than you think.

1181
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:37,985
And if not...

1182
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:41,660
Actually...

1183
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:46,106
Adam, I played better than
I have in my entire life.

1184
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:51,260
It was like I was possessed
and the music, it just...

1185
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:54,022
it poured out of me.

1186
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:58,387
God. I've never felt
anything like that before.

1187
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:00,981
Wow.

1188
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:04,103
I wish I could've seen that.

1189
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:06,830
Yeah, me too.

1190
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:11,505
You know, for once, I actually felt like

1191
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:14,069
I could do this.

1192
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:19,540
Why didn't you call me
after the audition to brag?

1193
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:22,825
I know I should have, but...

1194
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:25,180
I don't wanna fight, okay?

1195
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:27,111
I know. I don't wanna fight.

1196
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:32,900
Okay, well, you played better
than you have in your entire life.

1197
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,990
We should celebrate.

1198
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:47,340
So how come you've never
written a song for me?

1199
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:49,020
I don't know, I'm no good at writing

1200
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:50,860
about things that make me happy.

1201
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:52,300
If you want a song,
you're gonna have to, like,

1202
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:53,500
cheat on me or something.

1203
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:55,180
What do I have to do
for a whole album?

1204
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:57,140
Come on. Don't get greedy.

1205
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:03,180
You know, I don't
think I'll even get in.

1206
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:05,020
There were like 100 other kids there.

1207
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:07,860
Then I don't have to choose, right?

1208
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:11,540
But if you do get in, the choice
is already made, isn't it?

1209
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:13,860
Mia, come on. I'm not
gonna be that asshole

1210
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:16,340
that stops you from
going to Juilliard.

1211
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:19,100
If it was me, you'd let me go.

1212
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:22,146
Yeah, but in a way, I already have.

1213
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:24,540
You know, you're going
to your own Juilliard.

1214
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:26,426
Yeah, I know.

1215
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:28,985
But I'm still here.

1216
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:33,145
Okay? And I'm still
crazy in love with you.

1217
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:36,909
Yeah, me too.

1218
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:57,740
There you are.

1219
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:00,342
Been looking everywhere for you.

1220
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:05,420
Guess your big show
got canceled, huh?

1221
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:07,670
Like I give a shit.

1222
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:10,580
- Oh, I'm sorry. I'm just...
- No, it's fine.

1223
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:12,420
I get it.

1224
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:19,829
The first day, man.

1225
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:23,660
The first day I walked past that room

1226
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:26,228
and saw her playing, that was it.

1227
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:32,100
God, I'm such an asshole.

1228
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:34,543
No, Adam. Don't.

1229
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:42,471
She get in? To Juilliard?

1230
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:45,546
I don't know.

1231
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:48,060
Letters sent out Friday.

1232
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:50,867
I think she was
supposed to hear today.

1233
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:53,260
I can't.

1234
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:55,749
I can't lose her again.

1235
01:14:57,920 --> 01:14:59,581
Let's go.

1236
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:21,941
What now?

1237
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:24,943
Well, I gotta get
in there. I gotta see her.

1238
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:32,660
Excuse me.

1239
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:35,060
Hi, there's this girl
and she's having a baby

1240
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:37,260
in the bathroom on the third floor.

1241
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:38,860
And she's down there
and she's just grunting

1242
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:40,700
and screaming and there's
blood everywhere!

1243
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:41,980
And it's really unsanitary,

1244
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:43,540
and we really need someone
down there right now.

1245
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:44,660
Okay...

1246
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:47,300
We really need someone
down there right now!

1247
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:49,231
- Shit!
- Go!

1248
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:57,460
Excuse me, young man,
I've told you you can't be here.

1249
01:15:57,560 --> 01:15:58,620
Security, get me Security. Right now.

1250
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:00,631
Mia Hall?

1251
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:04,460
Please, I just wanna
feel you touch me.

1252
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,664
- Mia.
- Please.

1253
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:09,460
- Hands off.
- Come on.

1254
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:11,300
What are you doing? Get off me!

1255
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,823
You can't do this to him!

1256
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:16,340
You know, I tried to
do this the nice way.

1257
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:18,460
You wouldn't know nice if
it bit you in the ass, lady.

1258
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:20,585
Hey. Knock it off.

1259
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:22,460
- Willow?
- Willow?

1260
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:23,860
What the hell is going on?

1261
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:25,220
They were trying to
break into the ICU.

1262
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:28,100
Yeah, 'cause Jabba the Nurse
wouldn't let us in to see Mia.

1263
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:30,620
Well, I know these kids
personally, so, why don't you just let me

1264
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:32,745
handle it from here.

1265
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:37,310
Fine. Then just keep
them in the waiting room.

1266
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:42,900
What the hell were you guys thinking?

1267
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,150
I need to see Mia.

1268
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:49,861
Well, she's gonna need
you now more than ever.

1269
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:54,070
Hey, what's going on?

1270
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:56,949
Willow, what's happening?

1271
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:00,190
Willow, why aren't you with Teddy?

1272
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:02,307
Willow.

1273
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:05,100
Oh, shit.

1274
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:06,826
Teddy!

1275
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:14,785
Mr. and Mrs. Hall.

1276
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:17,703
- Teddy.
- I'm Dr. DeVenne.

1277
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:20,300
- Teddy?
- I am so sorry.

1278
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:21,620
Where is he?

1279
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:24,140
He had an epidural
hemorrhage in the brain.

1280
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:26,460
We did everything we
could to save him.

1281
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:28,346
No!

1282
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:35,700
He will never graduate
from T-ball to baseball.

1283
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:38,143
And never learn to drive.

1284
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:39,740
Never kiss a girl.

1285
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:41,140
You can't catch me!

1286
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:43,071
Never fall in love.

1287
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:50,105
God!

1288
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:54,868
I don't wanna... I don't wanna...

1289
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:57,940
God, I don't wanna...

1290
01:17:58,040 --> 01:17:59,740
I don't wanna do this anymore.

1291
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:02,069
I want this to be over!

1292
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:17,060
Give me the chart.

1293
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:18,340
Abdomen's rigid. Full of fluid.

1294
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:21,420
Jesus. Splenectomy,
brain contusions, collapsed lung.

1295
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:24,140
- We gotta run.
- BP and pulse ox are dropping.

1296
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:26,420
Okay, let's get her back in surgery.
Let's go, come on.

1297
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:28,660
Get out of the way.
Swipe the door, please.

1298
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:31,308
- Get that elevator.
- Out of the way!

1299
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:34,265
They know we're coming?

1300
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:38,540
All right, sweetheart.
We can only carry you so far.

1301
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:40,983
After that, it's all you.

1302
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:46,106
Oh, my God. Mia.

1303
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:51,430
- Oh, my God.
- Adam.

1304
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:54,265
Goodbye, Adam.

1305
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:03,420
It's almost time. It's almost time.

1306
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:05,460
I'll take some of that. Yeah.

1307
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:07,505
- Do not!
- Thank you!

1308
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:09,991
Cheers.

1309
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:13,020
9, 8, 7, 6...

1310
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:15,180
- There you are!
- Here I am!

1311
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:17,180
...5, 4...

1312
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:19,740
3, 2, 1.

1313
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:21,900
Happy New Year!

1314
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:28,740
"Even when they were
just wasting time

1315
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:30,700
"they weren't wasting time.

1316
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:34,463
"It was as if no time they spent
together could ever be wasted."

1317
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:35,740
Who said that?

1318
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:37,500
Some guy in some book.

1319
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:38,900
And what was he talking about?

1320
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,860
Some couple in some movie.

1321
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:41,940
My point is...

1322
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:43,180
Yes, maestro?

1323
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:47,020
My point is he could have
been talking about us.

1324
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:49,110
That he could.

1325
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:03,420
Promise me.

1326
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:05,300
I promise you.

1327
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:07,311
Wait, what am I promising?

1328
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:10,861
That we'll spend next
New Year's together.

1329
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:14,780
Even if we're in different places,
you'll still be with me.

1330
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:16,700
No, that's not good enough.
Not Skyping,

1331
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:19,300
not texting, together.

1332
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:22,904
Baby, you know we can't
promise each other that.

1333
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:27,666
I guess we both know
where this is heading.

1334
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:42,865
Yeah, I guess so.

1335
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:53,660
The old thing...

1336
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:55,180
- All right.
- Delicious!

1337
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:57,020
What are you looking at?

1338
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:59,420
Because we're fascinated.

1339
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:00,580
- You!
- Fascinating.

1340
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:03,260
You're a spatula man now.

1341
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:05,300
- Look it, a drummer.
- He's totally drumming with it.

1342
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:07,340
Come on, give me
your plate. All right, get ready.

1343
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:08,900
Hey! There she is.

1344
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,020
Hey!

1345
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:11,660
Happy New Year!

1346
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:13,140
If you're still drunk,
you're totally grounded.

1347
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:14,980
If not, I'm gonna let it slide.

1348
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:16,300
I'm definitely not drunk.

1349
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:18,860
Well, you were still out all
night so come on. Spill.

1350
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:20,180
How was the party?

1351
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:21,540
Fine.

1352
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:23,551
How was Adam?

1353
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:31,140
Okay, everybody. Let's move
this party to another room.

1354
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:32,500
Let's go.

1355
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:34,540
Take your mimosas.

1356
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:36,904
We'll go watch the Rose Parade.

1357
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:40,142
Come on. Let's go.

1358
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:50,860
I'm sorry.

1359
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:52,380
Oh, God, it's gross.

1360
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:54,470
It's not gross.

1361
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,911
Oh, God.

1362
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:58,380
You wash, I'll dry.

1363
01:21:58,480 --> 01:21:59,660
Yeah.

1364
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:01,340
Make us feel better.

1365
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:03,829
Warm water, soap.

1366
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:07,180
Oh, God.

1367
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:09,700
I'm such a mess.

1368
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:11,940
You know, we had this

1369
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:14,668
perfect year and a half together.

1370
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:21,740
And now, we're just moving
in different directions.

1371
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:23,705
Is it over?

1372
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:26,021
Yeah.

1373
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:31,780
You're supposed to
break up with someone

1374
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:33,300
because you're not in love with them.

1375
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:35,948
Not because you're completely
in love with them.

1376
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:41,700
But what do I know, right?
I'm only 17.

1377
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:43,900
You know plenty.

1378
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,940
It's just very inconvenient to
fall in love when you're age.

1379
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:48,500
Especially if it's the real thing.

1380
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:51,500
You know, if we weren't musicians,
we could just...

1381
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:54,260
We could just go to college together.

1382
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:55,980
You know, like normal people do.

1383
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:57,660
There's no such thing as normal, Mia.

1384
01:22:57,760 --> 01:22:58,860
Every relationship is rough.

1385
01:22:58,960 --> 01:22:59,940
I don't have to tell you that.

1386
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:01,060
Yeah, I know.

1387
01:23:01,160 --> 01:23:02,220
Don't blame it on music.

1388
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:04,743
Yeah, but music's the
reason we're breaking up.

1389
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:08,660
That is bullshit, Mia. You know that.

1390
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:11,069
What am I gonna do?

1391
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:14,786
I am being completely torn in half.

1392
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:17,820
You're going to go to Juilliard

1393
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:19,910
and play the hell out of your cello.

1394
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:23,103
Or you're not.

1395
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:25,140
You're gonna stay with Adam

1396
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:27,420
and have lots of amazing adventures.

1397
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:29,140
Or you're not.

1398
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:32,180
Or maybe tomorrow, the Earth's
gonna smash into a meteor.

1399
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:34,145
Or it's not.

1400
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:37,740
Life is this big fat
gigantic stinking mess.

1401
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:40,468
But that's the beauty of it too.

1402
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:43,860
Whatever you do, I support you.

1403
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:46,110
Either way, you win.

1404
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:49,546
And also either way there's
something that you lose.

1405
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:53,783
What can I say, baby?

1406
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:56,782
True love's a bitch.

1407
01:24:56,040 --> 01:24:57,701
Gramps.

1408
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:01,704
Gramps, what do I do?

1409
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:10,620
I've been trying to think of what

1410
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:15,191
Denny would
want me to say to you.

1411
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:17,704
The kid was a helluva
of dad, wasn't he?

1412
01:25:18,440 --> 01:25:20,942
He sure had me beat.

1413
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:26,549
I remember the day
that he quit the band.

1414
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:30,460
He just up and said,

1415
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:33,791
"That's it. The time has come."

1416
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:37,542
I was surprised.

1417
01:25:38,720 --> 01:25:42,429
I never really liked the
way the band sounded but,

1418
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:45,140
I knew how important
it was to him.

1419
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:49,142
And so I asked him, I said,
"Why are you quitting?"

1420
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:51,820
And he said,

1421
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:55,500
"You make sacrifices for your kids.

1422
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:57,864
"For your kids."

1423
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:00,500
He said that without even blinking.

1424
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:02,660
That's why he quit the band.

1425
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:04,220
For Teddy.

1426
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:06,060
For you.

1427
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:09,900
It was when he heard
you play so well.

1428
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,901
I think that's when
it clicked for him.

1429
01:26:13,640 --> 01:26:16,700
Your incredible talent, it...

1430
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:20,420
He just couldn't believe it.

1431
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:24,660
And all he wanted to do
was to give you more so.

1432
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:26,820
He quit the band,

1433
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:29,184
he sold his drum kit

1434
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:31,950
and he bought you that cello.

1435
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:35,465
Sacrifice.

1436
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:38,991
That's what we do for the
people that we love.

1437
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:43,103
And here's mine, Mia.

1438
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:45,784
I want you to live.

1439
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:48,340
I want that more than
anything in this world.

1440
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:52,467
I want you to fight like
hell to stay with us.

1441
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:56,380
But, with everybody else gone,

1442
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:58,540
I know it might not be what you want.

1443
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:03,304
It might be too hard for
you to keep fighting, so...

1444
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:08,029
If you wanna go,

1445
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:11,667
I want you to know it's okay.

1446
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:14,065
It's okay.

1447
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:19,503
I understand.

1448
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:32,510
Thank you.

1449
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:41,666
Gramps?

1450
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:37,061
Hey.

1451
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:40,620
Hey.

1452
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:46,620
So many people have come to see you

1453
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:49,621
I've lost count of them all.

1454
01:28:50,440 --> 01:28:54,180
There are like 30 people

1455
01:28:54,280 --> 01:28:56,305
in that waiting room.

1456
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:02,664
Some are related to
you and some aren't but,

1457
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:06,023
but we're your family.

1458
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:11,345
You still have a family, Mia.

1459
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:24,831
Look.

1460
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:28,700
This is my favorite picture of you.

1461
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:30,301
Ever.

1462
01:29:32,120 --> 01:29:34,110
You were so happy that day.

1463
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,264
And no matter what,

1464
01:29:40,640 --> 01:29:43,825
that's the way I'm always
gonna remember you.

1465
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:55,940
The best day of my life was
one I never even saw coming.

1466
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:57,220
It was Labor Day,

1467
01:29:57,320 --> 01:30:01,029
early this fall before things
started to go bad with Adam.

1468
01:30:01,160 --> 01:30:05,062
In some ways, it was just
like a usual potluck dinner.

1469
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:07,780
But there was a special feel to it.

1470
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:09,900
People kept on showing up.

1471
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,380
All the old friends
from Dad's band days

1472
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:15,580
and all the new ones
from Adam's band.

1473
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:18,820
Willow and Henry were there
with their newborn baby.

1474
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:21,420
Dad hauled the barbecue
out of the basement

1475
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:23,940
and he and Teddy spent
the day flipping burgers.

1476
01:30:24,040 --> 01:30:25,900
And when it started to get dark

1477
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:29,060
Henry had the bright
idea to start a bonfire.

1478
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:39,541
Mia!

1479
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:44,580
No way! I'm not playing for you guys.

1480
01:30:44,680 --> 01:30:46,260
Not for us, with us.

1481
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:47,820
Seriously, Mia, if you don't, I will.

1482
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:50,340
And have you ever heard the
sound of a thousand dying cats?

1483
01:30:50,440 --> 01:30:53,068
Come on, Hall.
We're playing together.

1484
01:30:53,680 --> 01:30:56,023
I really hate you all.

1485
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:03,580
All right, Mia.

1486
01:31:03,680 --> 01:31:05,306
Gotta play for us, Mia.

1487
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:25,140
I've always thought of the
cello as a solo instrument.

1488
01:31:25,240 --> 01:31:28,220
It's probably why it's always
made me so comfortable.

1489
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:30,310
Just me and my cello.

1490
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:33,900
But that night,
sitting around the bonfire,

1491
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,660
jamming with Adam and everyone else,

1492
01:31:36,760 --> 01:31:38,460
I realized I was wrong.

1493
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:41,500
The cello isn't a solo instrument.

1494
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:43,380
It's part of something bigger.

1495
01:31:43,480 --> 01:31:46,780
Today is the greatest

1496
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:48,980
Day I've ever known

1497
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:52,540
Can't live for tomorrow

1498
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:54,860
Tomorrow's much too long

1499
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:59,146
I'll burn my eyes out

1500
01:32:00,920 --> 01:32:05,106
Before I get out

1501
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:09,546
I wanted more

1502
01:32:12,280 --> 01:32:17,183
Than life could ever grant me

1503
01:32:17,960 --> 01:32:21,589
Bored by the chore

1504
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:27,861
Of saving face

1505
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:33,020
Today is the greatest

1506
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:35,220
Day I've never known

1507
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:38,820
Can't wait for tomorrow

1508
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:41,020
I might not have that long

1509
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:45,466
I'll tear my heart out

1510
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:51,704
Before I get out

1511
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:01,700
The thing is, Mom and Dad

1512
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:03,220
always had their scene.

1513
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:04,980
And Adam had his.

1514
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:08,660
And I was always jealous
because I didn't have mine.

1515
01:33:08,760 --> 01:33:11,342
Until the night of the bonfire.

1516
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:13,670
That was my scene.

1517
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:15,380
That was where I belonged.

1518
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:22,182
That's what happiness felt like.

1519
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:27,502
But that could never exist again.

1520
01:35:29,160 --> 01:35:31,901
Just after this piece.

1521
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:18,026
Adam.

1522
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:34,660
Mia.

1523
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:35,780
Don't.

1524
01:36:35,880 --> 01:36:37,711
Stay.

1525
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:42,940
I know a huge part of your
life is forever ruined

1526
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:45,780
because of what happened today.

1527
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:48,500
I'm not dumb enough to
think that I can fix it.

1528
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:50,590
You can't.

1529
01:36:51,240 --> 01:36:53,469
But I went to your house.

1530
01:36:54,240 --> 01:36:58,062
And I had to climb up the balcony
to get in like I used to.

1531
01:36:59,680 --> 01:37:02,911
And I found this in your mail slot.

1532
01:37:04,120 --> 01:37:06,220
I totally broke and entered
and stole your mail,

1533
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:08,743
so the Feds might be comin' after me.

1534
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:22,500
"Dear Mia,

1535
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:25,387
"it gives me tremendous pleasure..."

1536
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:30,829
Mia, you got in.

1537
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:34,422
To Juilliard. Mia, you did it.

1538
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:37,145
I got in.

1539
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:42,102
And if you want me to
come with you, I will.

1540
01:37:43,120 --> 01:37:45,463
Okay, I'll move to New York.

1541
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:48,508
I'll do whatever you want.

1542
01:37:49,160 --> 01:37:51,469
Just please stay.

1543
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:54,903
You're my home, Mia.

1544
01:37:55,760 --> 01:37:56,860
I don't care where we are.

1545
01:37:56,960 --> 01:37:59,349
I just care that we're together.

1546
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:03,189
I know that now.

1547
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:08,380
I will do anything if you stay.

1548
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:11,145
I can't.

1549
01:38:11,640 --> 01:38:13,301
You know I can't.

1550
01:38:19,640 --> 01:38:21,260
I'm still kinda working
on this thing, but...

1551
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:33,709
You wrote me a song.

1552
01:38:39,200 --> 01:38:42,460
Breathe deep, breathe clear

1553
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:45,100
Know that I'm here

1554
01:38:45,200 --> 01:38:48,220
Know that I'm here

1555
01:38:48,320 --> 01:38:49,580
Waiting

1556
01:38:49,680 --> 01:38:52,900
Stay strong, stay gold

1557
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,502
You don't have to fear

1558
01:38:55,680 --> 01:38:58,740
You don't have to fear

1559
01:38:58,840 --> 01:38:59,860
Waiting

1560
01:38:59,960 --> 01:39:07,184
I'll see you soon

1561
01:39:09,080 --> 01:39:14,100
How could a heart like yours

1562
01:39:14,200 --> 01:39:19,420
Ever love a heart like mine?

1563
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:24,460
How could I live before?

1564
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:28,380
How could I have been so blind?

1565
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:32,740
So blind

1566
01:39:32,840 --> 01:39:35,388
You opened up my heart...

1567
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:39,540
You still have a family.

1568
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:41,140
All your love

1569
01:39:41,240 --> 01:39:43,742
Is all I'll ever need

1570
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:47,346
I will do anything if you stay.

1571
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:49,820
If you wanna go,

1572
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:52,468
I want you to know it's okay.

1573
01:39:55,960 --> 01:40:00,749
How could I live before?

1574
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:02,871
How could I have lived?

1575
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:25,307
Mia.

1576
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:38,470
Take my mind and take my pain

1577
01:40:41,160 --> 01:40:46,143
Like an empty bottle takes the rain

1578
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:54,591
And heal, heal

1579
01:40:54,760 --> 01:40:57,388
Heal, heal

1580
01:41:00,360 --> 01:41:05,502
Take my past and take my sins

1581
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:13,142
Like an empty sail takes the wind

1582
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:21,347
And heal, heal

1583
01:41:21,560 --> 01:41:24,381
Heal, heal

1584
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:34,949
And tell me some things last

1585
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:44,024
And tell me some things last

1586
01:42:01,360 --> 01:42:06,070
Take my heart and take my hand

1587
01:42:08,280 --> 01:42:13,183
Like an ocean takes the dirty sands

1588
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:20,660
And heal, heal

1589
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:23,547
Heal, heal

1590
01:42:25,880 --> 01:42:30,669
Take my mind and take my pain

1591
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:37,585
Like an empty bottle takes the rain

1592
01:42:40,120 --> 01:42:44,860
And heal, heal

1593
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:47,906
Heal, heal

1594
01:42:49,400 --> 01:42:56,351
And tell me some things last

1595
01:42:58,160 --> 01:43:04,941
And tell me some things last

1596
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:13,791
And tell me some things last

1597
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:22,791
And tell me some things last

1598
01:43:36,640 --> 01:43:39,825
I spend these hollow nights

1599
01:43:40,200 --> 01:43:43,146
All alone

1600
01:43:46,840 --> 01:43:50,060
Safe from the looking glass

1601
01:43:50,160 --> 01:43:53,823
That you kept home

1602
01:43:56,440 --> 01:43:58,669
Let's go

1603
01:44:02,240 --> 01:44:05,060
I saw the sea and knew

1604
01:44:05,160 --> 01:44:09,631
It was a mirage

1605
01:44:12,400 --> 01:44:15,580
It wasn't even so

1606
01:44:15,680 --> 01:44:19,423
I played the odds

1607
01:44:23,480 --> 01:44:26,586
Full of black and blues

1608
01:44:28,600 --> 01:44:31,260
From all the nights with you

1609
01:44:31,360 --> 01:44:33,900
I never wanted to go

1610
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,389
I don't want you anymore

1611
01:44:36,520 --> 01:44:41,540
I don't want you to
feel the same as me

1612
01:44:41,640 --> 01:44:44,140
I never wanted to go

1613
01:44:44,240 --> 01:44:46,580
But now I'm letting you know

1614
01:44:46,680 --> 01:44:49,100
I just wanted to feel

1615
01:44:49,200 --> 01:44:54,228
The life in me

1616
01:44:58,360 --> 01:45:01,620
I went from solid steel

1617
01:45:01,720 --> 01:45:05,463
To broken glass

1618
01:45:08,600 --> 01:45:11,740
The darkest side in me

1619
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:15,071
You brought out fast

1620
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:22,990
The things I said were true

1621
01:45:24,640 --> 01:45:27,460
I'm taking them back from you

1622
01:45:27,560 --> 01:45:30,140
I never wanted to go

1623
01:45:30,240 --> 01:45:32,740
I don't want you anymore

1624
01:45:32,840 --> 01:45:37,780
I don't want you to
feel the same as me

1625
01:45:37,880 --> 01:45:40,340
I never wanted to go

1626
01:45:40,440 --> 01:45:42,900
But now I'm letting you know

1627
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,340
I just wanted to feel

1628
01:45:45,440 --> 01:45:49,661
The life in me

1629
01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:52,340
I miss you

1630
01:45:52,440 --> 01:45:55,102
I wish you

1631
01:45:55,720 --> 01:45:58,143
Will let me be

1632
01:46:00,080 --> 01:46:02,340
Just leave it

1633
01:46:02,440 --> 01:46:04,500
We stopped breathing

1634
01:46:04,600 --> 01:46:08,070
I need to be free

1635
01:46:08,480 --> 01:46:10,940
I never wanted to go

1636
01:46:11,040 --> 01:46:13,380
But now I'm letting you know

1637
01:46:13,480 --> 01:46:15,439
I just wanted to feel

1638
01:46:15,440 --> 01:46:21,663
The life in me
