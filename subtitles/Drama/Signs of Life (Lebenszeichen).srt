1
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:14,036
SIGNS OF LIFE

2
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,884
- Actors -

3
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:14,467
- Sound -

4
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:02,750
Written, directed & produced
by Werner Herzog

5
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:07,141
What's the matter?

6
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,212
It's so hot!

7
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,952
Bring him over there.

8
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,550
He's almost dead.

9
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:34,005
Four weeks
after the parachutist Stroszek

10
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,638
was transferred to Crete, -

11
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:38,878
- he was wounded and had to be
withdrawn from battle.

12
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:42,153
He and another soldier
had been shot at

13
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,416
by partisans in the west, -

14
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:47,425
- near the town of Chania.

15
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:49,961
It occurred during a lull
in the fighting, -

16
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:52,156
- in a village held
by the Germans.

17
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:42,672
After convalescence,

18
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:45,870
Stroszek was sent to Cos
in the Dodekanes.

19
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:48,140
On that island,
there had been no fighting.

20
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:49,704
It was peaceful there.

21
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:53,175
A helpful officer
sought to find a post -

22
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:55,846
- where Stroszek could spend
the rest of the war

23
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:58,117
- without seeing
any more action.

24
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:23,914
The occupation of the island
was peaceful, -

25
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:27,316
- and only required
a garrison of 60.

26
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,719
Stroszek was separated
from the main garrison -

27
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:31,984
- and stationed
in the old fortress.

28
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:03,955
H is Greek wife, Nora,
and two other soldiers -

29
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:05,456
- lived together with him there.

30
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:10,155
A previous guard informed them
about their duties.

31
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:13,357
The only entrance,
which could be reached by a bridge, -

32
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,901
- had to be kept locked at night.

33
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:38,186
Parts of the town had been destroyed
several times by earthquakes.

34
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:42,023
As a result, old relics were
often found under the ruins.

35
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:45,822
The Venetians
began to use relics

36
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:49,561
to fill in the walls
of the fortress.

37
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,762
After the walls were finished, -

38
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:53,669
- this was no longer possible.

39
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:15,217
There was an am m unition depot
in the main courtyard -

40
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:19,253
- which was abandoned by the
Greeks and had to be guarded -

41
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:24,065
- even though the Germans
couldn't use it in their own weapons.

42
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:28,899
Guarding this
was their only real task.

43
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:54,789
The living-quarters were located

44
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:57,427
in a newer building
in the fortress.

45
00:08:57,503 --> 00:09:00,734
There,
the still incom plete m useum

46
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:03,604
and the house of the restorer -

47
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:05,166
- had been requisitioned
by the army.

48
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:13,885
The surroundings had
a strange effect on Stroszek, -

49
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:18,686
- but he could find
no explanation for this.

50
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:21,556
However, the others adapted
themselves quickly to the place.

51
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:29,027
Stroszek had tried his hand
at various jobs without success.

52
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:31,365
At one time,
he had been a salesman.

53
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:36,966
But he had always wanted to
em igrate to Canada or Australia.

54
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:39,568
Then he thought of
going to Chile, -

55
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:42,773
- since he knew a fam ily there.

56
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:49,381
Nora nursed him in the hospital.

57
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:52,618
Stroszek had been granted
special perm ission to marry her.

58
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:44,372
What a shame that the people had
to leave all their belongings behind.

59
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:52,007
The household crockery,
their little pictures.

60
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:54,917
How touching it all is.

61
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:57,547
And now we are making ourselves
comfortable here.

62
00:10:57,623 --> 00:10:58,590
Do you understand me?

63
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:05,458
If this war goes on
m uch longer, -

64
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:07,499
- we'll spend a long time here.

65
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:12,098
If the war lasts very long, -

66
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:15,197
- I m ight have a baby here.

67
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:27,379
The words are hard to read
because they run into each other.

68
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:29,216
It's beautiful.

69
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:37,058
Becker had often m issed school
because of illness.

70
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:41,998
Still, he passed his exams
with the highest marks.

71
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:46,027
When war came, stronger men
were found unfit for service.

72
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:49,871
He passed his physical, but soon
fell ill after he was drafted.

73
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,991
Meinhard was formerly
a bar-keeper, -

74
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:15,932
- until one of his customers
was killed in a brawl.

75
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:17,696
He then became a crane-operator.

76
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,398
It paid better anyway.

77
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:47,560
Everything's full of oil here.

78
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,104
Here everything's full of oil.

79
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:04,675
Salad in oil,
fish in oil, meat, -

80
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,810
- machine-gun in oil.

81
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:09,821
What a shitty country!

82
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:15,660
Empty, no ammunition.

83
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,625
Are we supposed
to shoot with grease?

84
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:40,149
Okay, I'll get it.

85
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:56,599
I couldn't fix
a decent meal today.

86
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,399
Salt and other things
are m issing.

87
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:01,905
We have wine instead.

88
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:03,464
No thanks, not for me.

89
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:07,103
It tastes like turpentine.

90
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:13,476
Dammit!

91
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:15,543
This place is full of roaches.

92
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:18,414
They're not harmful.

93
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:21,186
They are the most repulsive
things on earth.

94
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,249
They don't even bite.

95
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:23,556
It's not that.

96
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:28,623
They snap and pop all night
long, just like this.

97
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:33,098
Just like that all night.

98
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:07,367
Becker, listen, I've got it.

99
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:12,499
The trap has to be placed
against the wall, -

100
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:18,107
- since the roaches always keep
running along the walls.

101
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:21,550
It works like this.
Look!

102
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:27,388
The roach runs
up this board or ram p -

103
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:29,791
- until it arrives
at this trap, -

104
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:35,323
- which moves
at the slightest touch.

105
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:37,130
Then it falls into the funnel, -

106
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:42,936
- either this way or that way.

107
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:49,104
It should be baited,
but with what?

108
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:52,742
What do you think they eat,
sugar?

109
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:55,412
One could try it.

110
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:07,760
Stroszek volunteered from the beginning
for sentry duty at night.

111
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:10,996
The lights in town
were never put out at night.

112
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,163
He loved to sit
facing the town -

113
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:17,038
- in order to show the world
that he was still functional.

114
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:26,810
Everyplace else had been bom bed:
only this place was spared.

115
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:32,084
Stroszek thought that he could detect
a kind of anticipation in the town -

116
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:36,025
- which somehow attracted him
and seemed to offer him a challenge.

117
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:32,706
U nbelievable!

118
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:34,343
There really are roaches
in here!

119
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:41,559
There are even two of them!

120
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:52,070
I know I've got
some insecticide somewhere.

121
00:17:56,775 --> 00:18:00,939
This is the right seasoning.

122
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:11,380
That's what they get -

123
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:14,654
- for being so repulsive.

124
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:34,936
Do we have turpentine
or something?

125
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:39,842
The brushes are getting sticky,
we can throw them away soon.

126
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:46,011
Maybe hot water would work.

127
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:48,746
Are you crazy?

128
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,117
- Gasoline.

129
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,417
- Gas would do the job.

130
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:56,154
I'll pick some up
when I go in town.

131
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:58,128
I can mail the letters too.

132
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:10,775
Those dam ned idiots, -

133
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:14,141
- loading me down
with a whole can.

134
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,680
And in this heat.

135
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:19,284
Dam m it!

136
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:20,682
That's what I say about it.

137
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,120
Regulations!

138
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,326
T o hell with them.

139
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:47,677
You took long enough.

140
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,270
I'm almost finished.

141
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:51,475
What do you mean, long?

142
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:56,078
You just can't reason
with those idiots from supply.

143
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:57,621
I tell them I want a little gas.

144
00:20:57,689 --> 00:20:58,917
They say they haven't got any.

145
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:02,085
So I had to take a whole can.

146
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,651
That's regulations for you.

147
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,595
H urry up.

148
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:09,190
I can't take this fiddling
around m uch longer.

149
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:12,726
We've only been here
two weeks, -

150
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:15,705
- and in two days
we won't have any more work.

151
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,298
In 2 days
we can twiddle our thumbs.

152
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:18,638
You are always napping anyway.

153
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,439
Don't be angry.

154
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:23,538
All work doesn't have to go
so fast.

155
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:27,042
Here are peaches.

156
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:42,628
Not peashes, but peaches.

157
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:48,698
Please take seat.

158
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:54,070
I'll make my round on the bike.

159
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:57,013
I'm not the best guard.

160
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:13,620
There's hardly any goat's m ilk.

161
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:16,725
So we have to drink
black coffee.

162
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:19,100
- Aha.
- Aha, what?

163
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,332
I've always said -

164
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:24,432
- that goat's m ilk is shit;
it tastes like he-goat.

165
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:27,342
Besides, she doesn't give
any m ilk.

166
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:28,902
Maybe we should sell her.

167
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:29,969
Who would buy her?

168
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:31,379
She's as old as Methuselah.

169
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:34,886
The founders
probably brought her.

170
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:35,977
A pity.

171
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:37,487
I imagined everything
to be so nice.

172
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:43,426
A goat that gives milk,
hens that lay eggs.

173
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:47,124
I imagined
a pretty little garden.

174
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:51,125
But this place
is too dry for that.

175
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:58,267
Well, Becker, what's up?

176
00:22:58,343 --> 00:22:59,742
Has the goat given any m ilk?

177
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:01,335
Found any eggs?

178
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:07,113
No, but there's a strange fellow
outside the gate.

179
00:23:07,185 --> 00:23:08,914
He wants to come in.

180
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:11,217
Do we know him, or what?

181
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:16,192
No idea;
he says he's a king.

182
00:23:16,261 --> 00:23:17,387
A king?

183
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:19,794
He must have a screw loose.

184
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:21,492
He's well-mannered.

185
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:22,931
Let's have a look at him.

186
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:27,370
Although the isolation of
the fortress weighed on them, -

187
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:30,237
- the appearance of a stranger -

188
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:33,766
- was felt as a violation of a domain
which had to be defended.

189
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,505
Excuse the disturbance.

190
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:40,415
I think I'd better leave.

191
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:42,953
I didn't realize
that soldiers were here.

192
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:46,047
I hope
that I didn't disturb you.

193
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:54,030
Would you like to have
some coffee?

194
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:57,694
No, please don't bother.

195
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:03,503
I had intended to ask this gentleman
whether I could spend the night here.

196
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:06,442
I'm a stranger in this country.

197
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:07,773
There would be room enough.

198
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:10,406
No, this is military territory.

199
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:13,042
Actually, we have no objections.

200
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:16,383
Excuse my curiosity,
but where do you come from?

201
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:21,256
I'm not sure, but I think
I was born in Portugal.

202
00:24:21,326 --> 00:24:25,626
I'm a gypsy, you know,
and am probably from Portugal.

203
00:24:25,697 --> 00:24:27,756
I was there as a small child.

204
00:24:34,372 --> 00:24:37,398
You say that you're a king?

205
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,341
Does this thing work?

206
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:51,113
That's nice.

207
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:52,315
Where did you get it?

208
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:55,052
I've had it for a long time.

209
00:24:55,126 --> 00:24:57,492
T ell us some more.

210
00:24:57,562 --> 00:24:59,689
This is a rare occasion.

211
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:01,823
I really am a king.

212
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,892
I became separated
from my tribe as a child.

213
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:07,905
Since then
I've been searching for them.

214
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:09,406
I've been
practically everywhere -

215
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:11,271
in Germany for a long time, -

216
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:16,042
- in Poland, England, and Spain.

217
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:18,639
I was in Rumania too.

218
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:23,211
I'm not ashamed of my poverty;
I can live of it.

219
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:26,086
Sometimes I do card-tricks.

220
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:30,184
It is quite difficult
for us gypsies.

221
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,854
What a strange person.

222
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:08,597
I mean the gypsy.

223
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:12,026
Do you think he was lying?

224
00:26:12,103 --> 00:26:15,004
Probably.

225
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,540
I didn't believe him.

226
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:19,236
He's like a paper flower
compared to this one.

227
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:26,680
Can you make anything
out of that?

228
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:30,744
It's difficult
for the words run together.

229
00:26:30,822 --> 00:26:32,289
Something's m issing here.

230
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:39,222
This word is "demos. "

231
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:40,525
What does "demos" mean?

232
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:41,623
People.

233
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:49,073
- "Kyna, " the dog...

234
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,472
Pardon me,
I used the wrong case.

235
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:58,913
I have the feeling that life's
rather unbalanced here.

236
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:01,817
Our duty here is as sim ple
as one can imagine.

237
00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:03,751
But keeping watch all night -

238
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:05,790
And one doesn't sleep
long mornings.

239
00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:07,916
It's really too short.

240
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:10,791
Why do you always try
to get us to hurry?

241
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:13,592
We have plenty of time
so we can take things easy.

242
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:27,241
Look!

243
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,306
A super egg from a super hen.

244
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:41,320
Could you give me the chalk
for a m inute to try something?

245
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:43,884
Know how to hypnotize a hen?

246
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:51,027
You press its head to the ground
and draw a straight line from the bill.

247
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:53,036
We used to watch
my grandfather do that.

248
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:56,562
One could also draw a circle.

249
00:27:56,641 --> 00:28:02,045
Then the hen would run in a circle
until it became exhausted.

250
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:04,377
Ever seen
a caterpillar procession?

251
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:10,354
There are thousands of caterpillars
creeping through the woods.

252
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:17,021
If you change the direction
of the first one so it follows the last, -

253
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:24,263
- then they run in a circle
until they are exhausted.

254
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:27,964
That would be a new method
to kill insects.

255
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,904
Come here my dear...

256
00:28:33,611 --> 00:28:36,205
What a stupid expression
hens have.

257
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:38,579
It could hypnotize one.

258
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:41,175
Hen, who is hypnotizing
whom here?

259
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:43,652
Watch now!

260
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:48,182
Ready; set; go!

261
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:01,098
Isn't that our king?

262
00:29:01,172 --> 00:29:04,664
Ah, you're still here!

263
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,768
This is a friendly place here.

264
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:09,871
I'd like to stay for a while.

265
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:14,180
Have you found
any of your clan yet?

266
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:16,584
You see, I've thought it over.

267
00:29:16,654 --> 00:29:23,526
It could be that your clan
is also looking for you, -

268
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:27,497
- and since you
are looking for them, -

269
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:31,194
- you might be going
in circles -

270
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,430
- and might never meet.

271
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:37,339
I don't run in circles;
others do.

272
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,535
Our people
always changes directions.

273
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:40,873
That's crazy.

274
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:46,842
I have a card trick to show you.

275
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:49,512
Is that a normal pack of cards?

276
00:29:49,587 --> 00:29:51,817
Y es, it's legitimate.

277
00:29:57,262 --> 00:29:59,594
All nines.

278
00:29:59,664 --> 00:30:01,097
There m ust be a trick to it.

279
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:03,999
You m ust have a second pack
up your sleeve.

280
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:06,229
Oh, that's a fine collection.

281
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:15,303
Here is something for you.

282
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:27,648
That's a souvenir,
a little wooden owl.

283
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:32,355
You can buy one in any shop.

284
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:34,295
Look.

285
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:38,802
The eyes and ears are moving.

286
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:53,981
Maybe hydro-pressure has something
to do with the movements.

287
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:04,654
The tail moves too.

288
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:06,594
Wait, it can be pulled out.

289
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:12,459
Something is moving inside -
a fly.

290
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:15,505
The poor things.

291
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:17,040
There's another one.

292
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:19,599
Look how it crawls.

293
00:31:19,677 --> 00:31:20,701
It's half dead.

294
00:31:20,778 --> 00:31:24,646
It's terrible
to do such a thing.

295
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:25,740
He's gone.

296
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:14,856
People here tell a story
about a submarine -

297
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:18,054
- that surfaced here
a few days ago.

298
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:21,724
It happened towards evening.

299
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:27,468
Some of the crew came up on deck
to get some fresh air.

300
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:34,571
It was just sunset -

301
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:40,174
- and they were so im pressed
by the setting sun -

302
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:44,779
- that they didn't notice
the enemy planes approaching.

303
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:47,654
Well, some did notice them, -

304
00:33:47,725 --> 00:33:52,526
- and they were able to
escape through the hatch.

305
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:58,001
They closed the hatch
and submerged.

306
00:33:58,069 --> 00:34:05,373
Three remained on deck
and were drowned.

307
00:34:06,944 --> 00:34:09,936
No, I'm not uneasy.

308
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:12,107
What's bothering you then?

309
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:13,775
What are you thinking about?

310
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:20,821
T ake off your shoes.

311
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:36,306
Come here quickly, Meinhard!

312
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:38,636
Where is Stroszek?

313
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:41,143
He's in the house with Nora.

314
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:44,511
I have copies of the texts
and even translations of them.

315
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:51,421
Stroszek,
come here for a m inute.

316
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:54,519
This is Achmed.

317
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,348
He says he's a Turk,

318
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:20,316
and as a Turk would normally
pray 5 times a day.

319
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:23,217
But he only prays
3 times a day now -

320
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:26,188
- because the children
scoff at him.

321
00:35:32,897 --> 00:35:36,697
He has a printed copy
of the inscription.

322
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:37,825
About our stone too?

323
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:38,891
About this one too;

324
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:45,603
I can read it to you,
if you like.

325
00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:48,873
Don't m ind if it is
only fragmentary.

326
00:35:48,946 --> 00:35:51,346
Much of it is om itted.

327
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:56,286
"... have shown reverence
to the gods, -

328
00:35:56,354 --> 00:36:00,085
- have offered thanks to the gods,
also the inhabitants of Cos... "

329
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:03,457
The text begins
right in the m iddle.

330
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:05,655
It continues like this:

331
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:09,325
"... for the days are sure;
the merchants sigh no more, -

332
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,801
- and the ports join
in the rejoicing:

333
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:17,466
- for the seas are safe,
the pirates destroyed.

334
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:19,976
All the robbers and their chief
have been hanged, -

335
00:36:20,044 --> 00:36:22,842
- even his dog has been hanged. "

336
00:36:23,781 --> 00:36:26,045
I can't make m uch of that.

337
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,387
You've got the wrong idea.

338
00:36:32,456 --> 00:36:35,118
The ancient Greeks
weren't like that.

339
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:39,630
During the Olym pic games,
they put stones between their knuckles -

340
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:41,324
- and covered them
with leather straps.

341
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:43,799
They smashed
their noses to pulp.

342
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:09,117
How beautiful it is when
the worst of the heat is gone.

343
00:37:13,097 --> 00:37:15,463
Where is Becker?

344
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:17,865
He's looking
for new inscriptions.

345
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:22,863
Stop that nonsense.

346
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,306
There aren't any fish there.

347
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,105
You just don't know!

348
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:34,708
At full moon the whole sea
is full of them.

349
00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:39,848
They're only an inch or so long;
but there are shoals of them.

350
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:44,861
The whole world
is full of vermin.

351
00:40:27,658 --> 00:40:29,888
What a mood you're in now.

352
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:36,165
What's wrong?

353
00:40:36,233 --> 00:40:38,030
Is it my fault again?

354
00:40:40,638 --> 00:40:42,799
Is it because of that cock?

355
00:40:42,873 --> 00:40:46,309
It wasn't my fault,
it was the children.

356
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:04,420
Do you know what kangaroos
look like on Sunday?

357
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:23,145
I can magnetize a knife.

358
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:26,377
Watch, ladies and gentlemen.

359
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:28,509
The greatest show on earth...

360
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:37,717
The magnetic current has to flow
through the arm into the knife.

361
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:56,974
It should be a straight wall,
a smooth one.

362
00:41:57,047 --> 00:41:59,481
There, now fold your arms.

363
00:42:01,085 --> 00:42:03,679
The one who holds out longest
is the winner.

364
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:14,022
On certain days Stroszek
became confused and apathetic.

365
00:42:14,098 --> 00:42:16,692
Now and then he undertook
something with haste,

366
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:19,668
only to give it up again.

367
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:23,696
Nora acted prudently;
but he began -

368
00:42:23,774 --> 00:42:26,538
- to withdraw from her
and the others.

369
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:33,006
Are you a tough one.

370
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:36,814
But only because you're light.

371
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:39,481
It's no wonder.

372
00:43:14,792 --> 00:43:16,555
Now I'm only against myself.

373
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:26,202
One time Stroszek stretched a rope
and tried tight-rope walking.

374
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:29,034
Meinhard ran for Nora
to stop him.

375
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:31,574
But he was already on the rope
by the time she arrived.

376
00:43:31,642 --> 00:43:35,806
But she retained her com posure,
and he didn't fall.

377
00:43:38,983 --> 00:43:40,575
What on earth are you doing?

378
00:43:40,651 --> 00:43:42,312
Lighting a cigarette.

379
00:43:42,386 --> 00:43:44,877
Are you mad?
We'll all explode!

380
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:45,944
Oh, I see.

381
00:43:52,429 --> 00:43:54,659
Give me the ones
that are finished.

382
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:57,790
I said the finished ones.

383
00:44:00,871 --> 00:44:02,463
All of them.

384
00:44:08,379 --> 00:44:11,542
Now fill them with some powder.

385
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:16,117
More wool.

386
00:44:16,186 --> 00:44:18,177
I didn't find any sawdust,
but it should work.

387
00:44:18,255 --> 00:44:20,553
What a way to cut that.

388
00:44:20,624 --> 00:44:25,323
Like this you see.

389
00:44:25,396 --> 00:44:26,954
That's how it should be done.

390
00:44:27,031 --> 00:44:29,226
Will that help?

391
00:44:29,299 --> 00:44:32,132
I'm sure that it'll work
like a rocket exploding.

392
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:34,727
No, not in any case.

393
00:44:34,805 --> 00:44:36,705
I'll show you.

394
00:44:36,774 --> 00:44:42,440
If I fill the rocket with powder
and then wool -

395
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:45,175
- it won't explode all at once.

396
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:49,015
It will go gradually,
understand?

397
00:44:49,086 --> 00:44:53,455
Before we proceed
we ought to try one out.

398
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:56,220
How many do you have?

399
00:44:56,293 --> 00:44:57,385
About 8.

400
00:44:57,461 --> 00:44:59,053
Wait to set them off.

401
00:44:59,129 --> 00:45:00,926
I'll get Nora.

402
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:07,598
It was Stroszek's idea
to make the fireworks -

403
00:45:07,671 --> 00:45:13,371
- out of the powder taken
from the shells in the depot.

404
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:15,605
But the others
had to do the work -

405
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:18,341
- for Stroszek had again lapsed
into passivity.

406
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:26,487
Thank God that we have something
to keep us busy again.

407
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:28,787
Now we can try one out.

408
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:30,486
Give me one of those.

409
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:33,029
Where are you
going to set it off?

410
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:35,565
Over this shaft here.

411
00:45:35,632 --> 00:45:41,070
I just hold it like this, light it,
and it will work just fine.

412
00:45:41,138 --> 00:45:43,629
That will blow
your hand to bits.

413
00:45:43,707 --> 00:45:45,265
No problem at all.

414
00:45:47,611 --> 00:45:50,603
Wouldn't it be better to attach
it to a piece of wood?

415
00:45:50,681 --> 00:45:52,171
You're cowards!

416
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:54,610
Out of the way there.

417
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:57,586
I won't take any responsibility
for this.

418
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:06,479
During the night, partisans
had secretly laid out a crown -

419
00:47:06,557 --> 00:47:09,788
- of light stones
on the mountain.

420
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:12,158
It could be seen
from a distance.

421
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:14,390
It didn't signify
immediate danger, -

422
00:47:14,464 --> 00:47:17,024
- but it did distinguish
friend and foe.

423
00:48:19,129 --> 00:48:23,463
Now that I can talk,
what shall I say?

424
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:31,862
Come on in.

425
00:49:31,935 --> 00:49:34,165
I won't disturb you.

426
00:49:34,237 --> 00:49:35,204
Well, then -

427
00:49:40,444 --> 00:49:42,503
Where are you stationed?

428
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:43,739
Here in the town.

429
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:47,011
But there is nothing to do
in this place.

430
00:49:47,084 --> 00:49:48,881
I have no official duties.

431
00:49:48,952 --> 00:49:52,149
I can practice all day long.

432
00:49:52,222 --> 00:49:54,281
You're really lucky, aren't you?

433
00:49:54,358 --> 00:49:56,952
But sometimes I have to carry
heavy objects,

434
00:49:57,027 --> 00:49:59,552
and that ruins my hands.

435
00:49:59,629 --> 00:50:04,293
Then I have to start all over again
until my fingers loosen up again.

436
00:50:04,368 --> 00:50:07,064
I'm actually running
after my fingers.

437
00:50:14,077 --> 00:50:19,344
I don't understand much about music,
but you do play well.

438
00:50:19,416 --> 00:50:22,078
That was Chopin.

439
00:50:22,152 --> 00:50:27,283
You may think that the music
is not fitting for this place.

440
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:28,551
It's different -

441
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:30,183
- malicious.

442
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:36,495
Chopin himself was malicious;
he was unpredictable.

443
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:40,058
The only thing
one could count on -

444
00:50:40,137 --> 00:50:41,729
- was him coughing blood.

445
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:24,809
Don't you hear it in the music?

446
00:52:14,531 --> 00:52:15,759
What's the matter?

447
00:52:15,832 --> 00:52:18,699
Nothing, nothing at all.

448
00:52:18,768 --> 00:52:21,999
Come on and tell me about it.

449
00:52:25,075 --> 00:52:27,635
Is it anything special?

450
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:31,977
No, nothing special.

451
00:52:32,048 --> 00:52:35,017
Then tell me what it is.

452
00:52:35,085 --> 00:52:37,349
Well...

453
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:41,789
no, I do feel at home
in the fortress, -

454
00:52:41,858 --> 00:52:43,883
- and we get on well enough, -

455
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:55,428
- but I feel closed in somehow,
the walls -

456
00:52:55,505 --> 00:53:00,568
- Y es, I see what you mean.

457
00:53:00,644 --> 00:53:03,772
You know that
we brought you here -

458
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:12,949
- especially to give you
a chance to recuperate.

459
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:16,322
Would you like to be sent
on patrol now and then?

460
00:53:16,393 --> 00:53:19,692
That would be nice.

461
00:53:19,763 --> 00:53:24,393
Look, I'll send you
to the southeast ridge tomorrow.

462
00:53:24,467 --> 00:53:25,593
That's not dangerous.

463
00:53:25,669 --> 00:53:29,002
But we have to show up there
again, anyway.

464
00:53:29,072 --> 00:53:32,439
It won't be too m uch
for his knee.

465
00:53:32,509 --> 00:53:34,238
I'll show you which route
to take on the map.

466
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:44,317
First to the ridge,
then the plateau.

467
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:47,254
You can be back
by the afternoon.

468
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:30,832
Wou Id you I ike to dri nk
some water?

469
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:33,664
Wife, get some water for them!

470
00:54:33,737 --> 00:54:36,035
Dri nk as m uch as you I ike.

471
00:54:41,077 --> 00:54:45,446
You're dri ppi ng with sweat.

472
00:54:57,661 --> 00:55:02,064
Don't you want to rest?

473
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:12,067
We don't have anything to eat.

474
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:15,134
Sorry, there's no bread.

475
00:55:15,211 --> 00:55:16,644
You may have
some more water, though.

476
00:55:18,682 --> 00:55:20,616
The little one can hardly talk;

477
00:55:20,684 --> 00:55:23,915
her mother is out
with the sheep, -

478
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:27,753
and I'm gone most of the night.

479
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:31,851
Now and then she goes into town
to visit her aunt Maria.

480
00:55:31,928 --> 00:55:34,863
There she learns
to talk a little.

481
00:55:34,931 --> 00:55:40,733
It's beautiful here;
there's water and fresh air.

482
00:55:40,804 --> 00:55:46,140
There are no children here
for her to talk to.

483
00:55:46,209 --> 00:55:48,769
She can hardly talk at all.

484
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:52,747
Won't you say your song
for them?

485
00:55:52,816 --> 00:55:57,378
Go and say it.

486
00:55:57,454 --> 00:55:59,854
Say it?

487
00:55:59,923 --> 00:56:04,019
Say it from the beginning.

488
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:11,896
High on the mountain,
lambs are grazing, -

489
00:56:11,968 --> 00:56:13,560
- grazing there in loneliness.

490
00:56:13,636 --> 00:56:16,070
One of them is lost.

491
00:56:16,139 --> 00:56:18,539
Run, shepherds, run!

492
00:56:18,608 --> 00:56:22,066
For over the mountains
are circling...

493
00:56:22,145 --> 00:56:25,114
- "vultures. "

494
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:35,760
Drink that.
It's good in the heat.

495
01:00:35,832 --> 01:00:40,462
You know that I can't stand
this thin stuff.

496
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:06,557
The medical officer wants to
exam ine us today at five o'clock.

497
01:01:06,629 --> 01:01:09,689
What?

498
01:01:09,766 --> 01:01:11,961
Our next exam ination
wasn't scheduled for two weeks.

499
01:01:12,035 --> 01:01:13,662
Don't ask me why.

500
01:01:13,736 --> 01:01:15,966
They do as they please with us.

501
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:26,542
Did you know that they are
thinking of sending you home?

502
01:01:41,998 --> 01:01:44,364
Why me?

503
01:01:49,072 --> 01:01:52,132
Because of yesterday
on the mountain.

504
01:01:57,647 --> 01:02:03,085
So, you squealed on me!

505
01:02:03,152 --> 01:02:06,053
Adm it that you squealed on me,
you swine!

506
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:17,466
Sit down, Stroszek,
and go on eating.

507
01:02:30,179 --> 01:02:31,737
Don't touch me.

508
01:02:31,814 --> 01:02:33,042
It's better like this.

509
01:02:33,116 --> 01:02:35,016
He and Nora saw the captain.

510
01:02:49,198 --> 01:02:50,688
Nora, out of the way!

511
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:53,292
Get away, get out of here!

512
01:04:09,579 --> 01:04:11,376
I don't see anything.

513
01:04:11,447 --> 01:04:14,041
The shooting m ust be com ing
from the houses.

514
01:04:14,116 --> 01:04:18,712
Stroszek has gone mad.

515
01:04:18,788 --> 01:04:21,518
He shot at us.

516
01:04:21,591 --> 01:04:23,149
It was just like the last time.

517
01:04:23,226 --> 01:04:25,456
He had another fit.

518
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:26,495
Did you disarm him?

519
01:04:26,562 --> 01:04:29,224
It was impossible;
he had a gun.

520
01:04:29,298 --> 01:04:30,822
It's not partisans.

521
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:33,960
One of our men on the fortress
has gone berserk.

522
01:04:34,036 --> 01:04:36,129
Stand by.

523
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:39,368
No, we don't need
any road blocks.

524
01:04:39,442 --> 01:04:41,774
Alright,
send a platoon over here.

525
01:04:41,844 --> 01:04:44,642
We may even have to move the H Q.

526
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:47,308
The entrance is exposed.

527
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:49,715
Who would ever
have imagined this?

528
01:05:04,333 --> 01:05:08,326
Send out some sentries;
but don't alarm him.

529
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:11,532
I think his wife can lure him
out in an hour or so.

530
01:06:14,603 --> 01:06:21,008
Away, go away.

531
01:06:21,077 --> 01:06:22,738
Come down from here.

532
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:27,249
I promise nothing
will happen to you.

533
01:06:27,316 --> 01:06:32,185
I don't follow orders anymore.

534
01:06:37,226 --> 01:06:41,856
I've taken up the cause of man.

535
01:06:54,076 --> 01:06:55,805
One has to keep something, -

536
01:06:55,878 --> 01:06:59,871
- plants.

537
01:06:59,949 --> 01:07:04,613
Their names:
wheat, barley, poppies.

538
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:08,418
Come down im mediately, Stroszek.

539
01:07:08,491 --> 01:07:09,651
That's an official order.

540
01:07:13,896 --> 01:07:15,761
Go away you swine!

541
01:07:20,269 --> 01:07:25,229
I'm going to blow up
the whole works.

542
01:07:32,415 --> 01:07:34,713
That was a m istake.

543
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:38,249
We should have taken
stricter measures.

544
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:42,450
Now he's worse and doesn't
expose himself at all.

545
01:07:42,525 --> 01:07:45,050
We can't get snipers
close enough -

546
01:07:45,127 --> 01:07:52,659
- because he m ight see them
and blow up the am mo.

547
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:54,794
What do you think doctor:

548
01:07:54,870 --> 01:07:59,102
is there a chance
he m ight return to normal?

549
01:07:59,175 --> 01:08:01,871
It's difficult to say.

550
01:08:01,944 --> 01:08:03,605
What you want is a prognosis, -

551
01:08:03,679 --> 01:08:08,673
- but with the information
I have,

552
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:12,915
I can't even make a diagnosis.

553
01:08:12,988 --> 01:08:15,923
We don't know the extent
of his injury.

554
01:08:15,991 --> 01:08:19,722
We don't have
the hospital report.

555
01:08:19,795 --> 01:08:25,324
And we know nothing about his
background and circumstances -

556
01:08:25,401 --> 01:08:29,929
- which led
to his present state.

557
01:08:30,005 --> 01:08:36,968
Still, we can reckon that he
m ight come back to normal soon.

558
01:08:37,046 --> 01:08:40,948
Just like yesterday,
after his fit.

559
01:08:41,016 --> 01:08:47,444
But I wouldn't count
on a rapid rem ission.

560
01:08:47,523 --> 01:08:54,087
I would suggest that we listen
to what Stroszek has to say, -

561
01:08:54,163 --> 01:08:57,792
- and how he behaves and acts.

562
01:08:57,867 --> 01:09:05,672
Then we m ight be able to understand
what is really the matter with him.

563
01:09:05,741 --> 01:09:08,904
How should we act towards him?

564
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:12,436
With extreme caution,
in any case.

565
01:09:12,515 --> 01:09:20,354
One m ust bear in m ind
that a person in his state -

566
01:09:20,422 --> 01:09:21,821
- is capable
of almost anything, -

567
01:09:21,891 --> 01:09:24,655
- even of executing
com plex actions.

568
01:09:24,727 --> 01:09:31,997
If you provoke him, he m ight
very well blow up the depot -

569
01:09:32,067 --> 01:09:34,126
- And from
the technical standpoint -

570
01:09:34,203 --> 01:09:36,068
- does he have
the technical capability?

571
01:09:36,138 --> 01:09:38,265
Y es.
I'm afraid he does.

572
01:09:48,551 --> 01:09:52,078
If he is ready,
it could go up now.

573
01:09:52,154 --> 01:09:54,679
It only takes a few grenades.

574
01:09:54,757 --> 01:09:57,783
What could be
the force of the blast?

575
01:09:57,860 --> 01:10:02,058
I'm not through with
my calculations.

576
01:10:02,131 --> 01:10:06,329
There are 5 or 6 tons of TNT, -

577
01:10:06,402 --> 01:10:09,030
- if all of
the hydro-m ines detonate.

578
01:10:09,104 --> 01:10:11,538
The other am mo
is not so dangerous.

579
01:10:11,607 --> 01:10:15,703
But that is enough to endanger
whole sections of the town.

580
01:10:15,778 --> 01:10:19,737
The damage would be
so extensive -

581
01:10:19,815 --> 01:10:25,811
- as to endanger the surrounding
houses from falling debris.

582
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:31,155
Then we have to evacuate
the other buildings.

583
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:34,321
It's what I anticipated.

584
01:10:34,396 --> 01:10:41,325
Mr. Vassiliou, we have summoned you
as a civilian representative.

585
01:10:41,403 --> 01:10:44,634
I hope you understand
this measure.

586
01:10:44,707 --> 01:10:45,969
Do you understand me?

587
01:10:46,041 --> 01:10:47,235
Y es, of course.

588
01:10:47,309 --> 01:10:49,743
It's difficult to move people.

589
01:10:49,812 --> 01:10:54,306
There's no place to put them.

590
01:10:54,383 --> 01:10:56,317
The German's take up
too m uch space.

591
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:05,359
He asks if anything
can be done to help.

592
01:11:05,427 --> 01:11:07,258
There's not m uch to eat, -

593
01:11:07,329 --> 01:11:13,962
- and the boats can't be unloaded
since they can't leave the harbor.

594
01:11:14,036 --> 01:11:18,473
The ships can't leave
the harbor anymore?

595
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:21,907
There's not m uch we can do now.

596
01:11:21,977 --> 01:11:25,242
At least not before dusk.

597
01:11:30,085 --> 01:11:33,213
If he remains quiet,
we can wait for one more night.

598
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:36,725
He'll return to normal soon,
maybe tomorrow.

599
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:40,558
He has to sleep or at least
relax his attention.

600
01:11:40,629 --> 01:11:47,762
We can discuss
the evacuation separately.

601
01:11:47,836 --> 01:11:54,036
The people in question will probably
have to leave their goods behind, -

602
01:11:54,109 --> 01:11:56,134
- in order to facilitate it.

603
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:05,886
Stroszek repeatedly threatened
to blow the am mo -

604
01:12:05,954 --> 01:12:09,185
- as soon as anyone came close.

605
01:12:09,258 --> 01:12:11,453
He said he would blow up
the whole place, -

606
01:12:11,527 --> 01:12:13,722
- and make the earth shake.

607
01:12:13,796 --> 01:12:18,358
Then people would see what was
at the bottom of everything.

608
01:12:18,434 --> 01:12:21,926
He wanted to make
this revelation.

609
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:26,236
After this, the evacuation
measures were accelerated.

610
01:12:46,662 --> 01:12:49,153
Don't be sad.

611
01:12:49,231 --> 01:12:53,065
If you are sad, we are too.

612
01:12:53,135 --> 01:12:58,095
I haven't seen my kids
for 10 years.

613
01:12:58,173 --> 01:13:05,443
I work every day,
and it is not easy.

614
01:13:05,514 --> 01:13:07,812
That's I ife for you.

615
01:13:07,883 --> 01:13:12,718
M uch happens
i n the course of I ife.

616
01:13:12,788 --> 01:13:17,088
Come to us when you are down.

617
01:13:17,159 --> 01:13:25,362
We can sit and talk.

618
01:13:30,139 --> 01:13:34,542
Stroszek didn't expose himself
and held the fortress against everyone.

619
01:13:34,610 --> 01:13:36,942
He was almost invulnerable.

620
01:13:37,012 --> 01:13:39,037
He challenged friend and foe
to battle, -

621
01:13:39,114 --> 01:13:41,639
- but no one accepted
his challenge.

622
01:13:41,717 --> 01:13:44,880
He declared war on everyone
in a furious protest.

623
01:13:44,953 --> 01:13:49,322
He even rebelled against
the orbit of the sun at dawn.

624
01:13:49,391 --> 01:13:52,849
He screamed that one could only
encounter light with light.

625
01:13:55,297 --> 01:13:56,594
Did everything go alright?

626
01:13:56,698 --> 01:13:59,132
There weren't any incidents at all.

627
01:13:59,201 --> 01:14:01,669
Such an action
is always unpopular.

628
01:14:01,737 --> 01:14:03,170
What is Stroszek doing now?

629
01:14:03,238 --> 01:14:06,435
T ake the rest of the guns
and files along too.

630
01:14:06,508 --> 01:14:07,475
He's been restless.

631
01:14:07,543 --> 01:14:09,238
Maybe he fears an attack.

632
01:14:09,311 --> 01:14:13,680
He's still threatening
to blow the place up.

633
01:14:15,651 --> 01:14:19,781
Look at this rag here.

634
01:14:19,855 --> 01:14:23,791
Exactly like this here, a rag...

635
01:14:25,194 --> 01:14:27,162
What is that?

636
01:15:39,468 --> 01:15:42,335
He failed to set the sun on fire, -

637
01:15:42,404 --> 01:15:47,273
- just as the town at which he
aimed his rockets remained unscathed.

638
01:15:48,644 --> 01:15:52,239
He only managed to kill a donkey
the day before.

639
01:15:52,314 --> 01:15:57,650
Now he had to be content
with a scorched chair.

640
01:17:40,188 --> 01:17:42,622
Since no one accepted
his challenge,

641
01:17:42,691 --> 01:17:45,182
Stroszek began to insult
the town.

642
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:47,990
A town
of im maculate virginity, -

643
01:17:48,063 --> 01:17:51,555
- just waiting for someone
to bom bard it.

644
01:17:51,633 --> 01:17:55,831
That's what every town
waits for.

645
01:17:55,904 --> 01:18:00,637
It was her fault that things
turned out unsatisfactory.

646
01:20:48,009 --> 01:20:50,307
We won't shoot at him.

647
01:20:50,378 --> 01:20:54,974
The danger of him setting fire
to the am mo would be too great.

648
01:20:55,050 --> 01:21:00,886
The best chance to catch him is
while he's setting off the rockets.

649
01:21:00,956 --> 01:21:04,585
He said that he was going to
set off some more soon.

650
01:21:04,659 --> 01:21:07,184
Y es, he still has many of the...

651
01:21:07,262 --> 01:21:08,752
how do you say...?

652
01:21:08,830 --> 01:21:09,854
You mean rockets?

653
01:21:09,931 --> 01:21:10,898
Fireworks?

654
01:21:10,966 --> 01:21:12,297
Y es, rockets.

655
01:21:12,367 --> 01:21:16,531
He surely has a lot left,
because we made many of them.

656
01:21:16,605 --> 01:21:21,099
If he does set off some more -

657
01:21:21,176 --> 01:21:24,942
- we could certainly
overpower him, -

658
01:21:25,013 --> 01:21:28,278
- for he sets off the rockets
near the battlement.

659
01:21:28,350 --> 01:21:36,724
And that's far-removed
from the am mo.

660
01:21:36,791 --> 01:21:39,419
He'll be so busy
with the rockets -

661
01:21:39,494 --> 01:21:45,194
- that my men can scale the wall
at various points sim ultaneously, -

662
01:21:45,267 --> 01:21:46,894
- particularly at dark.

663
01:21:50,205 --> 01:21:55,233
T ake up your positions at 6 o'clock
when you are given the sign.

664
01:21:55,310 --> 01:21:59,440
But wait to act at the moment -

665
01:21:59,514 --> 01:22:02,278
- when the first rocket goes up.

666
01:22:02,350 --> 01:22:07,686
There'll be
more fireworks today.

667
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:11,522
Men, the most im portant thing -

668
01:22:11,593 --> 01:22:13,618
- is to scale
the wall quickly, -

669
01:22:13,695 --> 01:22:18,064
- and at all three points.

670
01:22:18,133 --> 01:22:21,534
You will receive equipment for it, -

671
01:22:21,603 --> 01:22:25,403
- ropes, ladders, hooks,
and teargas.

672
01:22:48,897 --> 01:22:53,561
Stroszek cried that they could
do nothing to him, no one could, -

673
01:22:53,635 --> 01:22:56,229
- for he had now found
his calling.

674
01:22:56,304 --> 01:23:00,138
At 10 years of age, he was already
catching trout with his bare hands -

675
01:23:00,208 --> 01:23:02,733
- when the other boys
were still wetting their pants.

676
01:25:19,180 --> 01:25:23,378
During the night when Stroszek
again started another firework display, -

677
01:25:23,451 --> 01:25:26,352
- he was overpowered
by his own men.

678
01:25:26,421 --> 01:25:31,825
He didn't make it to the depot,
for he was already surrounded.

679
01:25:31,893 --> 01:25:35,886
In his rebellion he had
undertaken something titanic -

680
01:25:35,964 --> 01:25:38,660
- for the enemy
was far superior.

681
01:25:38,733 --> 01:25:42,692
Thus he had failed as miserably
as all others of his kind.
