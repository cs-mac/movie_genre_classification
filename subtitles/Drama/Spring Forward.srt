Shall we start?

169
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,930
<i>Go ahead.</i>

170
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:07,770
We can do it now.

171
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:12,190
Do it again.

172
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,200
Can you get out of here?
Please?

173
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,660
Ah, yes.
I’m sorry.

174
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,510
Mr. Director.

175
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,570
Yes, I'm sorry.

176
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,600
Don't mind me.
Please continue.

177
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,810
Do a good job.

178
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:24,870
Yes.

179
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,610
Dr. Kang, it looks so real.

180
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,510
I'll start again.

181
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,990
Okay.
I’m tying it again.

182
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:33,880
Go ahead.

183
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,960
I'll do it again.

184
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,910
<i>- Messer.
- Here.</i>

185
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:40,580
Hello.

186
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,830
Hello.

187
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,310
Huh?
Hey, hey.

188
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,820
The man who told you to pass
isn't there.

189
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:57,720
Look, look.

190
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,570
Really?

191
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,040
That's not him, right?

192
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:05,010
No, it's not.
God is smiling on us.

193
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:05,810
Let’s go.

194
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,050
Mister, give me two packs.

195
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:10,390
- Okay.
- It’s $19.20, right?

196
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,190
Yes.

197
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,720
Oh my God!

198
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,090
I said pass.

199
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,330
Wh... What?

200
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,930
You already bought some.

201
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,090
Already?

202
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,320
No.

203
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,620
What if I find it in your bag?

204
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,930
Mister.

205
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,870
Don’t be so strict.

206
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,670
Please understand our situation…

207
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:39,470
Please?

208
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,740
You bought enough for the two of you.

209
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,500
Why are you being so greedy?

210
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,300
Huh?

211
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,400
I’m busy.
Leave now.

212
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,350
Mister, it's not like that.

213
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:50,060
I’m a clinical dietitian
for Hae Gil Hospital.

214
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,660
I have to buy meat here today...

215
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:55,290
...to provide meals for our patients.

216
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,290
Also.

217
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,640
One of the patients won't
eat anything, so…

218
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,550
Do you really want me to believe this?

219
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:09,990
I tried to disguise myself with a cap
because I'm desperate...

220
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,810
…but I’m telling you the truth.

221
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,780
- I’m really from Hae Gil Hospital.
- Pass.

222
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:16,420
- Do Yoon.
- Yes.

223
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,600
Take a good look at these ladies...

224
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,350
…and don’t sell any beef
to them, alright?

225
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,710
- Okay.
- Mister!

226
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,660
Do you think that I’m lying to you?

227
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,720
Look me in my eyes, okay?

228
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,000
Hey, let’s just go.

229
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,820
He's not buying it.

230
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,750
Hey, you!

231
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,650
Wait a minute.

232
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,150
It’s you, right?

233
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,500
- Excuse me?
- What?

234
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,500
Buying our beef cheaply
and selling it at a markup...

235
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,420
It’s you, right?

236
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,450
What?

237
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:55,290
Do you think that we sell it
with no margin…

238
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:57,160
…for people like you
to take advantage of?

239
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,200
Mister.

240
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,650
- I think you've misunderstood us.
- Misunderstood?

241
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,900
Did you say that I misunderstood you?

242
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:06,970
Wow, what a young brat you are.

243
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,480
How dare you live your life for free?

244
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,000
Free?

245
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,890
My life for free?

246
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:18,640
Bom Yi.

247
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,610
Wait.

248
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,250
Mister.

249
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,650
I think that's a little much.

250
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,180
- I don’t think so.
- Let’s just go.

251
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,100
Wait a moment.

252
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,620
How dare you…

253
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,840
How dare you tell me
that I live my life for free?

254
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,310
Apologize to me right now.

255
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:35,460
Apologize?

256
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,630
Yes, apologize to me.

257
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,020
Yes, we did try to buy more beef...

258
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:42,100
...but it's because we really need it.

259
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,210
I don’t know what caused
such a misunderstanding, but...

260
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:48,090
...you shouldn't be that rude
without knowing me.

261
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:49,310
It's terrible manners.

262
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:51,280
Are you looking for manners
from a butcher?

263
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,930
I don’t know what a manners are...

264
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:55,500
...but I do know something
about a good beating.

265
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:59,190
Fine.
Just go home.

266
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,550
I let you go just this once.

267
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,860
If I see you again…

268
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,700
...I’ll give you a demonstration...

269
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,620
...a personal demonstration of how
you separate bone from flesh.

270
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:10,170
Hey, mister.

271
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,680
Apologize to me
for what you just said too.

272
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,400
Haven't you heard the saying,
"A person’s body is a gift..."

273
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,070
"...so not hurting them is
the start of one's filial duty"?

274
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,770
No, I haven't.
So what?

275
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:18,880
Who the hell are you…

276
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,960
...that you dare threaten my body...

277
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,400
...which was a gift from my parents?

278
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,040
Hey, mister!
Don’t run away from me.

279
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,180
Apologize to me right now.

280
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,700
If you don’t, I’ll sue you.

281
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,180
- Bom Yi!
- Get off me.

282
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,890
No, I won’t.
Apologize to me!

283
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:32,690
Right now!

284
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:33,610
Ugh!

285
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:38,990
Jesus, my beef!

286
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,670
Darn it.

287
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,400
What are you going to do
about my beef?

288
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,070
You’re lucky that
I’m ending this here.

289
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:48,560
If I actually see you again…

290
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,120
…I’ll break your legs.

291
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,760
Go away!

292
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:55,710
He must be really crazy.

293
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:59,270
Hey, are you hurt?

294
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:00,450
Let me see.

295
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,820
Oh my God.

296
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:07,820
What do you think about them,
Chairman Song?

297
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:11,990
We won't have a problem establishing
the International Medical Center…

298
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,200
…as long as Dr. Kang renews
his contract with us.

299
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,100
Dr. Kang’s contract will expire soon.

300
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:18,170
Lots of hospitals want him.

301
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,350
Why are you worried about it?

302
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,800
Dr. Kang and Bom Yi will get
married soon, won’t they?

303
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:25,130
Dr. Kang wouldn’t renew
his contract with us…

304
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:27,610
...just because they're getting married.

305
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:30,780
If he were willing to renew it,
he would have come to this meeting.

306
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:36,220
Judging by his uncooperative attitude…

307
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,220
...I don't think the renewal
will be easy.

308
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,520
Then why don’t you appoint him as
the new director of the hospital?

309
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,670
You have a grounds for it
since he’ll be your son-in-law.

310
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,900
Appoint him as director?

311
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,260
Then what about the current director?

312
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,850
He’s responsible for the hospital's
current situation.

313
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,640
It's been five years since then.

314
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,260
Why are you bringing that up again?

315
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:56,400
Yes.

316
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,680
It's been five years already, but...

317
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,670
…the hospital still hasn't
recovered yet.

318
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:04,510
Your husband is just
a figurehead anyway.

319
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:07,980
There’s no meaning in him
being director now anyway.

320
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,520
If you’re uncomfortable with it,
I’ll persuade him.

321
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:16,770
Maybe if we fail in renewing
Dr. Kang's contract...

322
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:18,360
…but not now.

323
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,600
Hey, the shooting finished
earlier than I thought.

324
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,630
I just did what I always do.

325
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,670
Wow, you've turned into a snob now.

326
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:37,290
By the way, why didn’t you participate
in the meeting today?

327
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,300
It’s not that I didn’t go.
It's that I couldn't.

328
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,350
No one asked me to come…

329
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,680
…even though I waited around for it.

330
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,690
You still should have gone.

00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,650
<i>...when I see these children?</i>

494
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:09,790
What should I do?

495
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,430
Hey.

496
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,080
Would you like to buy some ice cream?

497
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,610
It's really tasty because it's made
from Udo peanuts.

498
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:25,790
No, that’s not what I meant, but…

499
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:28,620
By the way, is it just the two of you?

500
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:30,120
Where's your mother?

501
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,940
Why are you asking about mother?

502
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,310
Mother isn’t here.

503
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:34,290
Ba Da.

504
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:37,570
What’s the matter?

505
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,300
That’s…

506
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:44,040
My dad's over there.

507
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:50,970
That man… is your father?

508
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,240
What’s the matter?

509
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,110
Well...

510
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,240
Come here a minute.

511
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,790
Is your house nearby?

512
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:10,860
Yes, it's in the back.

513
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:12,190
Ah…

514
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:24,140
Let's just do this
until those people are gone.

515
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:26,570
Thank you.

516
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,740
By the way, ma'am...

517
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,990
- No, it's *Noona.
- Noona.

518
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,990
[Noona: Older sister or older female]

519
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,890
Yes?
What is it?

520
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,690
Why were you crying over there?

521
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:39,770
Did you see it?

522
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:44,780
I think it’s because
of the sea breeze.

523
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,750
So your name is Ba Da?

524
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:50,370
Yes, and my sister’s name is Poo Reum.

525
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,670
So together you're *Poo Reum Ba Da?

526
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,670
[Poo Reum Ba Da: "Blue sea" in Korea]

527
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:54,610
That's very pretty.

528
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,950
It isn’t pretty at all.

529
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:59,910
Grandmother told us that
we’re troublesome.

530
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,280
Why?

531
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:04,320
It’s because Poo Reun Ba Da
ate up my mother.

532
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,190
Ba Da...

533
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,560
What does that mean?

534
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:11,090
She went to heaven.

535
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:14,630
She died.

536
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:21,570
Okay.

537
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:23,360
I get it.

538
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,100
Noona.

539
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:29,170
You told me that mother always
did this to you, right?

540
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:32,330
Yeah.

541
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:45,990
Wait a moment.

542
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,630
Here.

543
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:53,420
If you wear it like this,
it’s good for two reasons.

544
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:56,500
It can hide your back
and it'll keep your tummy warm.

545
00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:00,260
Don’t forget to mark the date
on your calendar.

546
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:03,680
Your name is Poo Reum, right?

547
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,980
If you have any more questions...

548
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,630
...call me here.

549
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,250
Okay.

550
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:15,030
Go in and change your clothes now.

551
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:17,360
What are you doing?

552
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:24,680
What do you mean?

553
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,870
Why are you here?

554
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,340
What do you mean?

555
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,420
Don't you recognize me?

556
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,100
Recognize what?

557
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:39,290
What are you doing here
with my children?

558
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:41,470
What is this about?
She gave you her card?

559
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,080
It’s nothing.

560
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,550
If it’s nothing,
why did you almost hug a stranger?

561
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,800
If you don’t know, just be quiet.

562
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,220
What is she saying?

563
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:54,090
You shouldn't leave your children
so you can day drink.

564
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,310
What’s wrong with you, really?

565
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,200
What do you know about me?

566
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,830
Dad, don’t be mean to her.

567
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,780
She helped me.

568
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:04,310
How did she help you?

569
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,610
Tell me.
What did you do?

570
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:09,100
Why are you blaming your child?

571
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:10,840
Step aside.

572
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:12,470
It’s none of your business…

573
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,920
I told you to stop it.

574
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:30,050
Still…

575
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,610
...if you hang around my children
like this...

576
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:33,880
...someone might misunderstand.

577
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,240
It’s okay.

578
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,420
I heard that…

579
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:41,510
…they don’t have mother…

580
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:44,510
...so take good care of them, okay?

581
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,570
Don’t let them eat junk food…

582
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,780
…and give them seaweed or beans.

583
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:50,810
Make sure they sleep warm too, okay?

584
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:54,970
Bye.

585
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,740
Auntie.

586
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,840
We sold three ice creams.

587
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,910
I told you not to do that.

588
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,520
I’m sorry.

589
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,240
The children did it for fun.

590
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,500
<i>Who the hell are you…</i>

591
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,390
<i>...that you dare threaten my body...</i>

592
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:32,820
<i>...which was a gift from my parents?</i>

593
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,610
<i>Hey, mister!
Don’t run away from me.</i>

594
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:35,900
<i>Apologize to me right now.</i>

595
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,910
<i>If you don’t, I’ll sue you.</i>

596
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:39,430
<i>- Bom Yi!
- Get off me.</i>

597
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:41,100
<i>No, I won’t.
Apologize to me!</i>

598
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,400
<i>Right now!
Ugh!</i>

599
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,430
<i>Jesus, my beef!</i>

600
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,940
I've seen the video and find
no liability on our part.

601
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,220
By the way, does Miss Lee Bom Yi
really have today off?

602
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,950
Do you have any problem with that?

603
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:57,730
After filing a complaint like this...

604
00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:01,730
...she should expect us to visit
her today for a settlement...

605
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:05,460
...but not she has the day off
and isn't answering her phone.

606
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:09,130
Are you considering her
a black consumer?

607
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:11,570
I'm telling you just in case.

608
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:13,670
If she asks for unreasonable amount…

609
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:15,100
…we’ll sue her too.

610
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,570
Miss Lee Bom Yi isn’t the kind of person
to ask for settlement money.

611
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,340
It's possible if she has the chance.

612
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:27,150
You’re making a big mistake now.

613
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:28,780
What do you mean?

614
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:31,850
If you go any further than this,
we’ll call a lawyer too.

615
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:36,700
Do you mean that your hospital
would deal with this?

616
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:39,680
I think there’s nothing more
to hear or say here.

617
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,010
Please leave now.

618
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:45,120
My daughter knows how to fight properly.

619
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,750
Hey, it's true she's your daughter.

620
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:52,200
Why does she cause so many problems?

621
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,310
She really concerns me.

622
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:58,480
What should we do?
She does it because she wants to.

623
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:01,380
God.
Really…

624
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,710
Do I have to tie her up at home
after she gets married?

625
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:06,650
Do it if you can.

626
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,160
Miss Bae.

627
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,230
Can you find out about Dr. Kang?

628
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:17,020
His family, his friends and...
his family issues.

629
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:18,230
I know nothing about him.

630
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:20,070
You don't need to talk so cautiously.

631
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:23,260
Miss Bae already knows
about your snobbery.

632
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:28,530
I mean, you understood her, right?

633
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:31,080
She meant that she wants you
to do a background check on Dr. Kang.

634
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,150
Yes.

635
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:33,850
Okay.

636
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,390
You.

637
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:38,590
You know where Bom Yi is now, right?

638
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,200
Did you write a doctor’s note
for Bom Yi?

639
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,060
Yes.

640
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:49,660
What a perfect couple you are.

641
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:51,270
You're suited so well for each other.

642
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:53,070
She started a war
with thousands of troops.

643
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:54,570
Excuse me?

644
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:57,100
She started a bloody war just
from posting something on the internet.

645
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,400
You gave her the weapon to do it.
Did you know that?

646
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,140
Ms. Chairman must be mad
because of Bom Yi again.

647
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,700
Tell me about it.

648
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,760
If she were here, she wouldn't
have any hair left.

649
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:10,880
I think she took the day off today
because of it.

650
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,190
- Her phone's off too.
- Is that right?

651
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:15,280
You didn’t know?

652
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:17,120
Didn’t she tell you
where she was going?

653
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:19,430
Well she must have another man then.

654
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:20,650
Too bad for you.

655
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:22,670
What a brat.

656

00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,570
Mr. Director.

658
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:33,370
Yes?

659
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:38,280
Is there any chance that Bom Yi knows
where her heart came from?

660
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:40,970
She doesn’t know who the donor was...

661
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:43,380
...but the heart came by helicopter...

662
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:44,960
...so she would know a rough location.

663
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:49,290
I saw a heart sticker over Udo Island
on the map in her room.

664
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,020
What about it?

665
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,900
I wonder if that's where she went.

666
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:04,750
It's the anniversary of the death
of her donor.

667
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:09,210
So she finally went.
