She wants me to tell her that her
husband is going to be okay...

And that I have every confidence...

and after all this work...

It's my job to keep their bodies from
giving out. Or what am I doing here?

00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,560
No.

485
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,480
I couldn't fix him.
I did everything right...

486
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,400
And I couldn't fix him.

487
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,240
That's not supposed to happen.

488
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,240
And I...

489
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,080
You cried.

490
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,240
Yeah.

491
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:51,240
SETH: Why do people cry?
MAGGIE: What do you mean?

492
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,320
I mean, what happens physically?

493
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,120
Well.

494
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:01,400
Tear ducts operate on a normal basis
to lubricate and protect the eye.

495
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:04,800
When you have an emotion,
they overact and create tears.

496
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,960
Why? Why do they overact?

497
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,960
I don't know.

498
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:12,720
Maybe...

499
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,520
Maybe emotion becomes so intense...

500
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,560
Your body just can't contain it.

501
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:21,320
Your mind and your feelings
become too powerful.

502
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,240
Your body weeps.

503
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,920
[ BEEPER ]

504
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,240
I have to go.

505
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,440
I got to go. Stay right here.

506
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,200
Don't go anywhere.

507
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,120
Stay right there.

508
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,720
MAGGIE: Get the tube out.
NURSE: He can't breathe.

509
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,760
It's because the tube is blocked.

510
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,760
MAGGIE:
How you feeling?

511
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,880
Ready to hit the waves.

512
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,640
MAGGIE: I'm afraid your body surfing
days are over.

513
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:24,000
You got a mean tattoo going there.
What does your wife think of that?

514
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,920
That is my wife.

515
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,800
Check his vitals every 15.

516
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,000
I can't see you, but I know you're there.

517
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:05,600
MESSINGER: Go back and tell them
that I'm not going.

518
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,600
Not yet.

519
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,760
JORDAN:
Where have you been?

520
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,680
MAGGIE:
Oh, shit. I totally forgot dinner.

521
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,240
JORDAN:
Dinner?

522
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:43,800
JORDAN:
With who?

523
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:50,320
A guy I met. I bumped into him
and we got something to eat.

524
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,080
Did you pack my backpack?

525
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,200
JORDAN:
What else?

526
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,640
We talked...

527
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,960
And then I got beeped
and he disappeared.

528
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,440
Why did you pack my backpack?

529
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:02,560
JORDAN:
Earl, what are you doing?

530
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,360
JORDAN: I thought we'd fly up to Tahoe,
use your uncle's cabin...

531
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:06,880
Maybe do a little hiking.

532
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,400
What?

533
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,000
God. Is it...?

534
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:15,480
Maggie, it's just a tick.

535
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:18,720
- Get a match.
- We're not going to burn him, Jordan.

536
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,800
It'll have to back out.
Can't leave the head in.

537
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,040
We can't just be burning tick heads.
JORDAN: Then get some alcohol.

538
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:25,120
I don't have any.

539
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:27,520
JORDAN: You don't have any alcohol?
MAGGIE: I don't operate here.

540
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,200
JORDAN:
How about some olive oil?

541
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,360
Which kind? Jalapeo or rosemary?

542
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,560
Rosemary.

543
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:40,280
JORDAN: So what did you and your
friend... What did you say his name was?

544
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:42,920
Seth.

545
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,960
What did you two talk about?

546
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:47,760
Dying.

547
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:53,640
Come on, we deal with life and death
every day. Why can't we talk about it?

548
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:56,800
I hope you won't become a
surgeon who prays in the O.R.

549
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:06,400
Can we talk for a minute?

550
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:07,920
We'll talk while camping.

551
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,440
Jordan, I can't go camping now.

552
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,320
We need some time together.

553
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,960
All right, let's see if we can
just spend 5 minutes.

554
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:19,280
Let's see if we can just stand
still together for 5 minutes.

555
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:21,000
Doing what?

556
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,160
Just being here.

557
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,160
I'll get the trail map.

558
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:27,720
No, I mean it.

559
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,440
Nothing but us.

560
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,000
What do I do?

561
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,720
Just look at me.

562
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:49,400
You can't do it.

563
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:52,880
You can't do it.

564
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:55,640
- You flinched. You lose!
- You cheat.

565
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,520
That old black magic called...

566
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:14,440
Love.

567
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,560
Thank you very much.

568
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,320
Welcome back. We've been talking
to mothers who are members of the KKK.

569
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:24,120
You want to watch anything?

570
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,000
MESSINGER:
Me neither.

571
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,960
SETH:
How do you know when I'm here?

572
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:45,680
I know.

573
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,320
MESSINGER:
Jeez, you look good.

574
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:53,680
I forgot how good everybody looked.

575
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,200
30 years of silence.

576
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:02,040
You got guts, kid, showing yourself
like that. I appreciate that. I do.

577
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:03,560
It'll make it easier.

578
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:07,120
I got to tell you, I feel fine.

579
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:08,880
You might want to check your orders...

580
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:11,080
Because I sure don't feel
like I'm dying.

581
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:12,480
You're not dying.

582
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:16,080
Right. Then how come you're
hanging around my room all the time?

583
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:18,520
I'm the only one with his ass
hanging out of his dress.

584
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:21,400
Unless...

585
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:26,360
Could it be...

586
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:28,560
The doctor?

587
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:31,440
Sure.

588
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,160
The doctor.

589
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,640
She's pretty.

590
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,400
A little flat-chested...

591
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,320
But all you need's a handful.

592
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,600
- Who are you?
- This is good.

593
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:44,080
This is what they call...

594
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:46,400
"serendipitous."

595
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,880
Look that up in the dictionary,
you'll see a picture of you and me.

596
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,320
Thank you.

597
00:48:58,040 --> 00:48:59,720
You ready to deal?

598
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:02,880
Because I can answer all
your questions, friend.

599
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:13,480
How's the French toast?

600
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,120
Fabulous.

601
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,440
Set me up.

602
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:26,600
Guess I should introduce myself.

603
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:28,760
Come on, give me your hand.

604
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,680
Put it in mine. There you go.

605
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,880
A little tighter. Tighter.
There you go.

606
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:36,480
No, that's too much.

607
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,880
There you go. Good grip.

608
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,280
Nathaniel Messinger.

609
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,240
Glutton, hedonist...

610
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:47,640
Former celestial body,
recent addition to the human race.

611
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:52,960
I don't believe you.

612
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,440
MESSINGER:
You want proof?

613
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:56,680
MESSINGER:
You hang out at a library.

614
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,520
MESSINGER:
You can speak every language.

615
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:00,720
You travel with the speed of thought...

616
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,800
And you're reading
my mind right now.

617
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,160
Stop that.

618
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:05,600
You're doing it.

619
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,360
It's impossible.

620
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:11,720
"Some things are true
whether you believe them or not."

621
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,280
How?

622
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,200
MESSINGER: You choose.
SETH: Choose?

623
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,000
To fall to Earth.

624
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:22,080
You take the plunge,
the tumble, the dive.

625
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,280
You jump off a bridge.
Leap out a window.

626
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:27,240
You just make up your mind
to do it and you do it.

627
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:33,280
MESSINGER: You wake up all smelly,
and aching from head to toe...

628
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,200
And hungrier than you've
ever been...

629
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:38,840
Only you have no idea what hunger is
or any of that stuff...

630
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:42,920
So it's all real confusing
and painful, but very, very good.

631
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:46,800
Human.

632
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:49,760
Listen, kid:

633
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:54,120
He gave these bozos
the greatest gift in the universe.

634
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:56,400
You think He didn't give it to us too?

635
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:57,560
Which gift?

636
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,800
Free will, brother.

637
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,440
Free will.

638
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,440
MESSINGER:
Couldn't get a job.

639
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,760
MESSINGER:
No past, no training.

640
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,440
MESSINGER:
No l.D.

641
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:38,440
Then one day, I was walking
past a building site.

642
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:40,040
A skyscraper.

643
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:42,800
And I thought, "l could do that."

644
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,880
You see, these people down here...

645
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:48,040
A lot of them are afraid of heights,
you know what I'm saying?

01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:42,880
Try.

985

We fit together.

This is what I like best.

You haven't even started yet.

996

We have our whole lives together.

Don't go. The driver went.

I wanted to show you everything.

God, no, Maggie!

1015
01:36:01,320 --> 01:36:02,600
To touch you...

1016
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:04,000
And to feel you.

1017
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:07,760
To be able to hold your hand right now.
