<i>[Episode 12]</i>

3
00:01:32,534 --> 00:01:34,024
What is this?

4
00:01:35,344 --> 00:01:37,054
Why is it beating so fast?

5
00:01:37,654 --> 00:01:39,354
Is something wrong with my heart?

6
00:01:52,434 --> 00:01:54,324
What... where did she go?

7
00:02:02,214 --> 00:02:04,664
Why is Seung Hyun sleeping over there?

8
00:02:08,954 --> 00:02:10,904
Where did No Ra go?

9
00:02:19,064 --> 00:02:20,514
<i>[Cha Hyun Suk]</i>

10
00:02:28,244 --> 00:02:29,293
Hey.

11
00:02:29,294 --> 00:02:32,123
Ha No Ra, where are you?

12
00:02:32,124 --> 00:02:33,294
Home.

13
00:02:36,094 --> 00:02:39,243
Hey! If you were leaving,
you should've told me.

14
00:02:39,244 --> 00:02:42,213
Sorry. You were asleep, so...

15
00:02:42,214 --> 00:02:45,503
You went alone when it's still dark out.
You should be more careful...

16
00:02:45,504 --> 00:02:48,414
Anyways, you couldn't sleep so you left?

17
00:02:49,154 --> 00:02:54,163
Huh? It was just so hot.

18
00:02:54,164 --> 00:02:56,394
Saunas are supposed to be hot.

19
00:02:57,274 --> 00:02:59,773
Can you take care of Seung Hyun?

20
00:02:59,774 --> 00:03:02,483
Don't worry about that.
Just get more sleep.

21
00:03:02,484 --> 00:03:07,583
Oh, make sure to tell your husband
why you stayed out last night.

22
00:03:07,584 --> 00:03:09,664
I'll take care of it.

23
00:03:13,894 --> 00:03:17,214
Why is it so uncomfortable?

24
00:03:21,084 --> 00:03:24,043
I guess she didn't feel comfortable
staying out overnight.

25
00:03:24,044 --> 00:03:25,694
Since she took off like a bullet.

26
00:03:36,894 --> 00:03:39,284
Who were you talking to
so early in the morning?

27
00:03:40,574 --> 00:03:41,844
My friend.

28
00:03:54,624 --> 00:03:56,024
Cha Hyun Suk?

29
00:03:58,374 --> 00:04:00,173
Professor, thank you.

30
00:04:00,174 --> 00:04:03,813
I'll definitely pay you for the repairs
next month when I get paid.

31
00:04:03,814 --> 00:04:06,323
Instead of paying for the repairs,
run errands for me.

32
00:04:06,324 --> 00:04:07,404
What?

33
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:11,063
You can just run an errand for me later.

34
00:04:11,064 --> 00:04:13,153
Oh, like yesterday?

35
00:04:13,154 --> 00:04:14,224
Yes.

36
00:04:14,674 --> 00:04:18,014
Anyways Professor,
you like No Ra, don't you?

37
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:22,234
Nope.

38
00:04:26,644 --> 00:04:27,913
Park Seung Hyun.

39
00:04:27,914 --> 00:04:30,973
I just think that you two
look good together.

40
00:04:30,974 --> 00:04:35,453
Hey kid, No Ra and I are just friends.

41
00:04:35,454 --> 00:04:37,054
Just friends.

42
00:04:37,754 --> 00:04:39,433
You want to quit our club?

43
00:04:39,434 --> 00:04:43,333
I think it'll be hard to do club work
while working part-time.

44
00:04:43,334 --> 00:04:45,373
I already miss so many meetings.

45
00:04:45,374 --> 00:04:48,943
It wasn't easy getting in, you should
keep at it even if it's just a hobby.

46
00:04:48,944 --> 00:04:52,583
I wanted to,
but I think that was also a dream.

47
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:55,423
Reality is getting in the way.

48
00:04:55,424 --> 00:04:58,493
There is a right time for everything.

49
00:04:58,494 --> 00:05:02,414
As for dancing, I'll be content
with just watching from now on.

50
00:05:03,894 --> 00:05:08,593
But if the club needs help,
send out an SOS whenever.

51
00:05:08,594 --> 00:05:11,043
Except for when I have to work,
I'll help with everything.

52
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:13,453
I'm really going to send out an SOS.

53
00:05:13,454 --> 00:05:16,863
When we need manual labor help
and stuff, I'm going to contact you.

54
00:05:16,864 --> 00:05:18,333
Of course, Senior.

55
00:05:18,334 --> 00:05:21,424
Once a junior, forever a junior.

56
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:14,814
Why am I like this?

57
00:06:21,494 --> 00:06:25,054
Gosh, why did he have to startle me
by sleeping so close?

58
00:06:39,394 --> 00:06:43,003
Producer Cha also knew that
Ha No Ra is your wife, right?

59
00:06:43,004 --> 00:06:44,503
One thing I know for sure

60
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:47,364
is that he doesn't know about you at all.

61
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:50,934
When anxious, being direct is the best.

62
00:06:54,704 --> 00:06:56,744
Hello, Professor Cha.

63
00:06:58,804 --> 00:07:00,743
Our committee has decided to accept

64
00:07:00,744 --> 00:07:07,183
Professor Kim Woo Chul's decision not to
consult for the "You and Now" project.

65
00:07:07,184 --> 00:07:08,914
Of course it has.

66
00:07:11,834 --> 00:07:13,554
Why is he acting so cold?

67
00:07:16,784 --> 00:07:23,224
They way he's looking at me is not
as someone who's interested in me.

68
00:07:24,724 --> 00:07:26,813
Why does it feel
like it's a look of hatred?

69
00:07:26,814 --> 00:07:28,304
Kim Woo Chul and Ha No Ra...

70
00:07:28,334 --> 00:07:30,633
<i>If my intentions are exposed,
it won't be fun anymore.</i>

71
00:07:30,634 --> 00:07:32,333
- Legally...
<i>- Find the answer.</i>

72
00:07:32,334 --> 00:07:34,244
<i>Since you're smart.</i>

73
00:07:36,044 --> 00:07:38,413
Okay, I will find out
what the intention was.

74
00:07:38,414 --> 00:07:40,824
Since I'm a smart woman.

75
00:07:42,944 --> 00:07:47,894
Ha No Ra and Cha Hyun Suk
are high school friends.

76
00:07:49,224 --> 00:07:52,863
Cha Hyun Suk used to like Ha No Ra.

77
00:07:52,864 --> 00:07:57,044
And Ha No Ra's husband is Kim Woo Chul.

78
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:02,643
Cha Hyun Suk really dislikes
Ha No Ra's husband.

79
00:08:02,644 --> 00:08:05,513
Why? Because he still likes Ha No Ra?

80
00:08:05,514 --> 00:08:06,873
That's not it.

81
00:08:06,874 --> 00:08:09,243
He showed interest in me.

82
00:08:09,244 --> 00:08:10,634
Then why?

83
00:08:19,884 --> 00:08:21,514
The fountain pen?

84
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:36,513
<i>Kim Yi Jin, you're dating someone
in secret, right?</i>

85
00:08:36,514 --> 00:08:39,924
You should date properly,
before it's too late.

86
00:08:41,224 --> 00:08:43,604
Will "W" turn into a heart?

87
00:08:44,434 --> 00:08:46,594
Oh, Mother! Father!

88
00:08:47,784 --> 00:08:51,814
Cha Hyun Suk knew all along?

89
00:08:52,654 --> 00:08:54,614
You have something to say?

90
00:08:55,064 --> 00:08:57,183
You told me to find out
what your intention was.

91
00:08:57,184 --> 00:08:59,174
I came for a confirmation.

92
00:08:59,764 --> 00:09:00,954
A confirmation?

93
00:09:01,814 --> 00:09:05,414
Cha Hyun Suk, are you interested in me?

94
00:09:06,954 --> 00:09:09,324
I was, a lot.

95
00:09:10,114 --> 00:09:11,814
"I was..."

96
00:09:13,544 --> 00:09:16,554
Were you interested in me as a woman?

97
00:09:17,544 --> 00:09:21,103
I never said
I was interested in you as a woman.

98
00:09:21,104 --> 00:09:25,003
I never said I gave you a ride because
I wanted to be with you, or liked you.

99
00:09:25,004 --> 00:09:27,003
I said let's go ride a bicycle.

100
00:09:27,004 --> 00:09:29,583
I never said let's ride it together.

101
00:09:29,584 --> 00:09:32,594
Is my intention clear to you now?

102
00:09:32,904 --> 00:09:35,254
If you can answer one more thing.

103
00:09:36,114 --> 00:09:38,473
Why did you pretend you weren't friends
with Ha No Ra

104
00:09:38,474 --> 00:09:40,284
when in fact you two are friends?

105
00:09:43,044 --> 00:09:47,053
As expected, my hypothesis is correct.

106
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:50,073
Was that you warning
Professor Kim Woo Chul?

107
00:09:50,074 --> 00:09:54,113
If Professor Kim didn't say anything,
then I also don't have anything to say.

108
00:09:54,114 --> 00:09:58,383
But there's one thing you got wrong.

109
00:09:58,384 --> 00:10:00,843
As for Professor Kim Woo Chul and I...

110
00:10:00,844 --> 00:10:05,423
We are not having an affair
like you think we are.

111
00:10:05,424 --> 00:10:08,453
What's your definition of an affair?

112
00:10:08,454 --> 00:10:12,883
Professor Kim Woo Chul and his wife,
they are not a married couple.

113
00:10:12,884 --> 00:10:15,984
In a practical sense, they are divorced.

114
00:10:17,934 --> 00:10:19,813
What do you mean...

115
00:10:19,814 --> 00:10:24,093
Oh, I knew Ha No Ra
wouldn't have told you anything.

116
00:10:24,094 --> 00:10:27,073
That's probably why
you put yourself forward like that.

117
00:10:27,074 --> 00:10:28,813
I asked what do you mean?

118
00:10:28,814 --> 00:10:32,563
A few years ago,
they agreed to get divorced.

119
00:10:32,564 --> 00:10:35,334
They even got their agreement notarized,
those two.

120
00:10:35,734 --> 00:10:38,433
Divorce? Notarized?

121
00:10:38,434 --> 00:10:41,223
If you can't believe me,
then ask Ha No Ra about it.

122
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:43,343
She probably has the notarized agreement.

123
00:10:43,344 --> 00:10:44,833
One thing is clear.

124
00:10:44,834 --> 00:10:48,553
I met Professor Kim Woo Chul who was
in essence already divorced.

125
00:10:48,554 --> 00:10:51,883
And the reason why that agreement
hasn't been fulfilled yet

126
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:55,824
is because Ha No Ra
is having a hard time letting go.

127
00:10:56,564 --> 00:11:00,344
That's also the explanation behind
her going to college in secret.

128
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:06,933
Would a sane person work at a college
if his ex-wife was going to that school?

129
00:11:06,934 --> 00:11:12,434
Kim Woo Chul had no idea Ha No Ra
was even going to college.

130
00:11:15,664 --> 00:11:18,943
So don't go around
misunderstanding things.

131
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:22,924
And make sure
no unfounded rumors get spread.

132
00:11:30,224 --> 00:11:32,914
This is the final audition list
for each character.

133
00:11:33,924 --> 00:11:37,293
Can you confirm with them that they will
be participating in the next audition?

134
00:11:37,294 --> 00:11:38,654
Okay, I will.

135
00:11:39,224 --> 00:11:41,983
Before you do that, let's eat.
You must be hungry.

136
00:11:41,984 --> 00:11:43,513
What would you like?

137
00:11:43,514 --> 00:11:45,613
Whatever you like, Sang Ye.

138
00:11:45,614 --> 00:11:47,954
You always tell me to choose what I want.

139
00:11:51,184 --> 00:11:52,703
Do you like spicy rice cakes?

140
00:11:52,704 --> 00:11:56,193
Of course.
I used to live in a spicy rice cake place.

141
00:11:56,194 --> 00:11:58,354
Senior likes spicy rice cakes too.

142
00:11:59,284 --> 00:12:04,024
Were you two regulars at
a spicy rice cake place in high school?

143
00:12:05,704 --> 00:12:09,713
Do you by chance know that
spicy rice cake place too?

144
00:12:09,714 --> 00:12:12,384
Senior still hasn't told you?

145
00:12:12,964 --> 00:12:18,174
That place is run by Yang Dong Chul who
went to Haekwang High School with you.

146
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,914
Yang Dong Chul?

147
00:12:21,634 --> 00:12:24,514
It's a store run by Dong Chul?

148
00:12:34,274 --> 00:12:35,384
Oh my.

149
00:12:36,324 --> 00:12:39,134
<i>Grandma's Flower Spicy Rice Cakes
is the name of the place.</i>

150
00:12:41,524 --> 00:12:44,714
Another regular who inherited the recipe?

151
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:48,274
Enjoy.

152
00:12:49,814 --> 00:12:51,114
Ha No Ra!

153
00:12:52,394 --> 00:12:53,934
Dong Chul!

154
00:12:57,254 --> 00:12:59,143
You're finally here, huh?

155
00:12:59,144 --> 00:13:01,313
What do you mean by "finally here"?

156
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:03,763
Aren't you here because Cha
told you about this place?

157
00:13:03,764 --> 00:13:05,073
No.

158
00:13:05,074 --> 00:13:08,544
How exactly did this come about?

159
00:13:09,004 --> 00:13:10,773
Oh my! What is this?

160
00:13:10,774 --> 00:13:14,003
What is that sign?
Yang Dong Chul, why are you here?

161
00:13:14,004 --> 00:13:16,613
Why didn't you say anything
when we met at Haekwang High School?

162
00:13:16,614 --> 00:13:19,224
Just come in for now. Come on in.

163
00:13:20,804 --> 00:13:25,503
Back then, Yoon Young fainted
after No Ra's grandma's burial.

164
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:29,154
Do you remember that's why
I cleaned up Grandma's store?

165
00:13:29,464 --> 00:13:30,583
Yeah.

166
00:13:30,584 --> 00:13:34,563
I sent you the store deposit and
Grandma's bank account, right?

167
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:36,913
Yes, but that's not important.

168
00:13:36,914 --> 00:13:41,603
How is that you're running the store now
with the exact same recipe?

169
00:13:41,604 --> 00:13:43,314
It's because of Hyun Suk.

170
00:13:43,954 --> 00:13:45,614
- Cha Hyun Suk?
- Cha Hyun Suk?

171
00:13:46,854 --> 00:13:50,934
When I went to organize everything,
Hyun Suk came along with me to the store.

172
00:14:12,074 --> 00:14:15,184
Did you get everything that
Ra Yoon Young wrote down on the list?

173
00:14:16,984 --> 00:14:18,184
Yeah, I did.

174
00:14:20,104 --> 00:14:23,113
I guess we won't be able to eat
Grandma's Flower Spicy Rice Cake anymore.

175
00:14:23,114 --> 00:14:26,723
Mister Bae from the real estate office
said this is a good location.

176
00:14:26,724 --> 00:14:28,284
He wants to run it.

177
00:14:31,264 --> 00:14:32,924
What good would it do?

178
00:14:33,924 --> 00:14:35,404
It wouldn't taste the same.

179
00:14:36,274 --> 00:14:40,884
Hey, hey, hey! It's the seasoning.

180
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:43,863
There was a reason for that unique taste.

181
00:14:43,864 --> 00:14:45,504
What is this, anyways?

182
00:14:47,974 --> 00:14:49,413
Dried radish.

183
00:14:49,414 --> 00:14:53,284
If you stir-fry this and make a stock,
it will taste savory and delicious.

184
00:14:54,444 --> 00:14:56,043
I didn't know it back then.

185
00:14:56,044 --> 00:15:00,424
But Cha had taken ownership of the
store and let Mister Bae run it.

186
00:15:00,784 --> 00:15:06,134
Hyun Suk took ownership
of my grandma's store?

187
00:15:06,594 --> 00:15:07,764
Why would he do that?

188
00:15:08,634 --> 00:15:11,683
He said he'd yearn for it forever
if he didn't.

189
00:15:11,684 --> 00:15:14,524
But why are you running it now?

190
00:15:15,284 --> 00:15:17,413
I never succeeded with my acting.

191
00:15:17,414 --> 00:15:20,193
I got caught up in a pyramid scheme,
and ended up with a large debt.

192
00:15:20,194 --> 00:15:23,313
I was going to set up a stationery store
by the school, so I came to this area.

193
00:15:23,314 --> 00:15:26,053
And I saw this store,
Grandma's Flower Spicy Rice Cake.

194
00:15:26,054 --> 00:15:28,233
The building was getting old,
and they were going to close down.

195
00:15:28,234 --> 00:15:29,974
So, the secret recipe was passed on to me.

196
00:15:30,674 --> 00:15:33,604
I became friends with Hyun Suk after that.

197
00:15:34,464 --> 00:15:39,934
Hyun Suk was the one to keep
my grandma's store alive all this time?

198
00:15:45,514 --> 00:15:49,933
<i>Professor Kim Woo Chul and his wife,
they are not a married couple.</i>

199
00:15:49,934 --> 00:15:53,093
<i>In a practical sense, they are divorced.</i>

200
00:15:53,094 --> 00:15:56,963
She couldn't even tell him
she's terminally ill, or going to college.

201
00:15:56,964 --> 00:16:00,433
She's 38 years old, and he makes
her work a part-time job.

202
00:16:00,434 --> 00:16:02,454
Why is she living with someone like that?

203
00:16:02,684 --> 00:16:04,303
Because he's her universe.

204
00:16:04,304 --> 00:16:06,693
It would make Min Soo's dad uncomfortable.

205
00:16:06,694 --> 00:16:10,573
We agreed to pretend
not to know each other at school.

206
00:16:10,574 --> 00:16:14,303
<i>A few years ago,
they agreed to get a divorce.</i>

207
00:16:14,304 --> 00:16:17,324
<i>They even got their agreement notarized,
those two.</i>

208
00:16:19,984 --> 00:16:21,404
Ha No Ra.

209
00:16:22,334 --> 00:16:24,344
You idiot. You idiot.

210
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:28,474
You lived your life like that?

211
00:16:31,354 --> 00:16:34,003
Why didn't Cha Hyun Suk
say anything earlier?

212
00:16:34,004 --> 00:16:35,883
Hey, Yang Dong Chul! You too!

213
00:16:35,884 --> 00:16:37,903
I told you.

214
00:16:37,904 --> 00:16:40,923
Hyun Suk told me not to say anything.

215
00:16:40,924 --> 00:16:45,093
It's fine. At least I know now.

216
00:16:45,094 --> 00:16:46,773
Thank you.

217
00:16:46,774 --> 00:16:49,854
Both you and Hyun Suk.

218
00:16:51,274 --> 00:16:55,663
Hyun Suk must have been
really close to your grandma.

219
00:16:55,664 --> 00:16:57,104
I guess so.

220
00:16:58,004 --> 00:16:59,934
I couldn't even do what he did.

221
00:17:29,364 --> 00:17:30,964
<i>[Ha No Ra]</i>

222
00:17:33,354 --> 00:17:34,544
Where's No Ra?

223
00:17:34,894 --> 00:17:37,313
Senior, by chance...

224
00:17:37,314 --> 00:17:40,563
Was I not supposed to tell her
where the spicy rice cake store is?

225
00:17:40,564 --> 00:17:41,894
What do you mean?

226
00:17:42,514 --> 00:17:44,093
We were deciding where to eat.

227
00:17:44,094 --> 00:17:46,833
And she asked about the spicy rice cake
store, so I told her where it is.

228
00:17:46,834 --> 00:17:49,004
She left and hasn't been back.

229
00:17:49,904 --> 00:17:51,074
Oh yeah?

230
00:17:55,024 --> 00:17:57,314
- You did good.
- What?

231
00:17:58,074 --> 00:18:00,143
She needs the good memories.

232
00:18:00,144 --> 00:18:02,813
Sometimes, memories can give you strength.

233
00:18:02,814 --> 00:18:05,664
Senior, what do you mean by that?

234
00:18:06,734 --> 00:18:11,814
I want No Ra to remember
just how much she was once loved.

235
00:18:16,044 --> 00:18:18,534
Oh, Dong Chul. Is No Ra still there?

236
00:18:20,654 --> 00:18:22,004
What is she doing?

237
00:18:22,374 --> 00:18:24,083
<i>She's crying.</i>

238
00:18:24,084 --> 00:18:27,534
<i>She heard the story about the store,
and now she's crying.</i>

239
00:18:29,324 --> 00:18:30,814
Just let her cry.

240
00:18:32,224 --> 00:18:34,693
Close the store, and let her cry in peace.

241
00:18:34,694 --> 00:18:36,603
I'll cover the sales for today.

242
00:18:36,604 --> 00:18:39,113
<i>You want me to close the store
and let her cry?</i>

243
00:18:39,114 --> 00:18:41,053
<i>You'll cover the sales?</i>

244
00:18:41,054 --> 00:18:44,283
<i>Hey! Are you Ha No Ra's husband?
Are you her dad?</i>

245
00:18:44,284 --> 00:18:45,784
I'm her older brother, you punk.

246
00:18:46,724 --> 00:18:48,784
That's right. I'm not joking.

247
00:18:50,274 --> 00:18:52,424
Don't talk to her. Let her be.

248
00:18:54,064 --> 00:18:57,594
What is it now, and why are you acting
like her older brother this time?

249
00:18:58,404 --> 00:19:00,703
I'm feeling heartbroken, that's why.

250
00:19:00,704 --> 00:19:04,333
Is Professor Kim Woo Chul refusing
to break up with Kim Yi Jin?

251
00:19:04,334 --> 00:19:06,283
That's not what's important.

252
00:19:06,284 --> 00:19:08,953
As for No Ra's relationship with
Kim Woo Chul...

253
00:19:08,954 --> 00:19:12,103
I couldn't fix it to begin with.

254
00:19:12,104 --> 00:19:14,223
What do you mean by that?

255
00:19:14,224 --> 00:19:18,643
The thing with the universe is...
it's not something we can live without.

256
00:19:18,644 --> 00:19:20,484
I didn't think of that.

257
00:19:20,904 --> 00:19:22,984
Can you live without the universe?

258
00:19:23,414 --> 00:19:25,603
We can't even live without the Earth.

259
00:19:25,604 --> 00:19:29,723
Are you saying that Kim Woo Chul
is Ha No Ra's universe?

260
00:19:29,724 --> 00:19:31,533
If I had known earlier...

261
00:19:31,534 --> 00:19:35,093
I wouldn't have been so mean, taunting,
or ask so many questions.

262
00:19:35,094 --> 00:19:36,534
I wouldn't have gotten angry.

263
00:19:37,704 --> 00:19:39,564
I wouldn't have done anything.

264
00:19:40,024 --> 00:19:43,643
I should have just been good to her.

265
00:19:43,644 --> 00:19:45,044
Like an older brother.

266
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:49,504
I should have been good to her
like an old friend.

267
00:19:50,784 --> 00:19:53,704
She has no one to turn to or lean on.

268
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:57,324
I should have become someone
she could depend on.

269
00:20:05,024 --> 00:20:08,444
What should I say when I see him?

270
00:20:09,634 --> 00:20:11,124
Thank you...

271
00:20:13,244 --> 00:20:17,164
Thank you doesn't really cover it.

272
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:27,004
- You're here?
- You're back?

273
00:20:31,174 --> 00:20:33,174
Sorry I'm late.

274
00:20:33,724 --> 00:20:35,784
Sorry I'm late, Sang Ye.

275
00:20:36,334 --> 00:20:39,504
While you were playing hooky,
I did all your work, Ha No Ra.

276
00:20:39,834 --> 00:20:41,193
Sorry.

277
00:20:41,194 --> 00:20:43,824
I wasn't in my right mind.

278
00:20:44,304 --> 00:20:46,643
- By the way, Hyun Suk...
- Hold on.

279
00:20:46,644 --> 00:20:49,813
Sang Ye, did you pick some actors
for the roles of Dae Chul and Su Jin?

280
00:20:49,814 --> 00:20:52,204
Yes, I picked a few people for now.

281
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:56,164
Then the only urgent thing left
is the meeting to come up with a title.

282
00:20:56,494 --> 00:20:59,343
A meeting? I'll prepare some tea.

283
00:20:59,344 --> 00:21:00,654
Forget about tea.

284
00:21:01,984 --> 00:21:03,293
Go get the car ready.

285
00:21:03,294 --> 00:21:05,374
- Sang Ye, you get the equipment.
- Okay.

286
00:21:05,814 --> 00:21:07,353
Are you going somewhere?

287
00:21:07,354 --> 00:21:10,834
We're having the meeting outdoors today.
I'll get ready and come down.

288
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,113
We have meetings outdoors?

289
00:21:16,114 --> 00:21:18,813
Sometimes he likes to do them outside.

290
00:21:18,814 --> 00:21:21,504
Whenever he feels tired,
there's a place he likes to go.

291
00:21:21,884 --> 00:21:23,044
Oh.

292
00:21:23,384 --> 00:21:25,144
Where is it?

293
00:21:27,984 --> 00:21:30,713
What kind of meeting can we do
at a campground?

294
00:21:30,714 --> 00:21:32,904
We're too busy to go too far.

295
00:21:34,254 --> 00:21:36,563
He really is quite odd.

296
00:21:36,564 --> 00:21:38,163
Your Senior over there.

297
00:21:38,164 --> 00:21:40,454
I really can't keep up with him.

298
00:21:41,224 --> 00:21:43,973
Ha No Ra, Shin Sang Ye.
You two are talking instead of moving.

299
00:21:43,974 --> 00:21:46,474
Ha No Ra, you haven't read my script yet
have you?

300
00:21:48,524 --> 00:21:49,734
Read this.

301
00:21:50,034 --> 00:21:52,633
Sang Ye, you go over the audition lines.

302
00:21:52,634 --> 00:21:53,664
Okay.

303
00:21:56,074 --> 00:21:57,114
Here.

304
00:21:58,324 --> 00:22:00,744
But who will do the cooking?

305
00:22:01,274 --> 00:22:03,223
Who else? I'll have to do it.

306
00:22:03,224 --> 00:22:07,233
Because you played hooky before,
you couldn't read it back then.

307
00:22:07,234 --> 00:22:08,693
You need to read it quickly now.

308
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:10,964
You have to read it in order for us
to have our meeting.

309
00:22:11,674 --> 00:22:13,044
Okay, here.

310
00:22:15,994 --> 00:22:17,534
Report back to me when you're done.

311
00:22:19,664 --> 00:22:22,054
All right.

312
00:22:29,384 --> 00:22:31,564
Is this okay?

313
00:22:32,174 --> 00:22:34,883
When Senior wants to do
a meeting outdoors

314
00:22:34,884 --> 00:22:37,583
it's best to do what he tells you to do.

315
00:22:37,584 --> 00:22:38,874
Oh...

316
00:23:21,924 --> 00:23:25,474
Right... he's always had those dimples.

317
00:23:44,084 --> 00:23:45,664
Let's eat!

318
00:23:51,124 --> 00:23:54,103
Wow! Budae stew!

319
00:23:54,104 --> 00:23:55,853
When did you prepare all this?

320
00:23:55,854 --> 00:23:58,083
This is nothing.
I've lived alone for many years.

321
00:23:58,084 --> 00:23:59,744
Sit down. Let's eat.

322
00:24:00,794 --> 00:24:02,453
I'm so curious.

323
00:24:02,454 --> 00:24:03,574
Try it.

324
00:24:13,784 --> 00:24:15,054
It's amazing, isn't it?

325
00:24:15,574 --> 00:24:17,853
I think you're better than me.

326
00:24:17,854 --> 00:24:20,364
Hey, that's not true.
I know your cooking skills.

327
00:24:21,914 --> 00:24:24,813
You're right. I don't cook that often.

328
00:24:24,814 --> 00:24:26,553
But there's nothing I can't make.
Right, Sang Ye?

329
00:24:26,554 --> 00:24:28,694
Of course. It's only because you don't.

330
00:24:29,534 --> 00:24:32,344
Why did you go so overboard today?

331
00:24:33,634 --> 00:24:36,273
I told you. It's for our meeting
to come up with a title.

332
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:39,563
Eat lots, and come up with many ideas.

333
00:24:39,564 --> 00:24:43,674
I'm not too confident about ideas,
but I will eat lots of food.

334
00:24:44,884 --> 00:24:49,664
I can't recall how long it's been since
someone's prepared a meal for me.

335
00:24:53,294 --> 00:24:56,074
Here, here. Eat lots of meat too. Okay?

336
00:25:02,224 --> 00:25:04,574
This is really good!

337
00:25:05,054 --> 00:25:09,123
But why are you
changing the title anyways?

338
00:25:09,124 --> 00:25:12,913
Hey, it's a rule that we do not talk
about work while eating.

339
00:25:12,914 --> 00:25:16,203
We will have our meeting after eating
and cleaning everything up.

340
00:25:16,204 --> 00:25:18,114
Our minds will be clearer.

341
00:25:18,714 --> 00:25:21,804
Senior, what should our bet be
for who has to do the dishes?

342
00:25:22,484 --> 00:25:24,144
Bet for the dishes?

343
00:25:25,484 --> 00:25:29,283
Wow! I got it. I got it!

344
00:25:29,284 --> 00:25:30,983
I got it again.

345
00:25:30,984 --> 00:25:32,814
You're just on fire today.

346
00:25:33,654 --> 00:25:36,094
Senior, you're really bad at this.

347
00:25:36,454 --> 00:25:38,054
Oh yeah!

348
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:41,783
Oh yeah, Godori!

349
00:25:41,784 --> 00:25:44,483
Have you been playing Go-Stop
all the time?

350
00:25:44,484 --> 00:25:47,383
Yeah, I guess my past skills
are still there.

351
00:25:47,384 --> 00:25:49,303
You have to win three out of five games.

352
00:25:49,304 --> 00:25:50,674
It's not over yet.

353
00:25:53,154 --> 00:25:56,733
Hey! The winner gets to shuffle the cards.

354
00:25:56,734 --> 00:25:59,314
In my neighborhood, the loser
gets to shuffle the cards.

355
00:26:01,814 --> 00:26:04,244
Oh! What is that?

356
00:26:06,914 --> 00:26:09,143
What? What is it?

357
00:26:09,144 --> 00:26:11,343
Oh, it was just a lamb.

358
00:26:11,344 --> 00:26:12,604
Let's go again.

359
00:26:27,374 --> 00:26:30,174
Oh yeah! You're all dead.

360
00:26:33,084 --> 00:26:34,304
You're in trouble.

361
00:26:42,974 --> 00:26:45,883
Go on, Cha Hyun Suk. I'll do it.

362
00:26:45,884 --> 00:26:47,304
I lost.

363
00:26:47,674 --> 00:26:50,643
You did the cooking and
now the dishes, too?

364
00:26:50,644 --> 00:26:54,563
I'm your employee, at that.
It's just wouldn't be right.

365
00:26:54,564 --> 00:26:55,633
Come on.

366
00:26:55,634 --> 00:26:58,253
Then you can rinse the dishes.
We can do it together.

367
00:26:58,254 --> 00:26:59,254
Here.

368
00:26:59,255 --> 00:27:01,344
Should we do that? Okay.

369
00:27:12,374 --> 00:27:13,794
Thanks.

370
00:27:14,724 --> 00:27:17,484
For what? Your grandma's store?

371
00:27:21,304 --> 00:27:26,113
I didn't realize how close you were
to my grandma.

372
00:27:26,114 --> 00:27:29,114
I received a lot of free meals
from your grandma.

373
00:27:30,214 --> 00:27:31,743
Still...

374
00:27:31,744 --> 00:27:34,994
I don't know how I can pay you back.

375
00:27:35,664 --> 00:27:37,814
Why don't you say,
"thank you, Oppa"?

376
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:41,343
What? "Oppa"?

377
00:27:41,344 --> 00:27:42,984
I am taller than you.

378
00:27:43,374 --> 00:27:45,063
Does being taller than me
make you my older brother?

379
00:27:45,064 --> 00:27:46,253
I'm not just taller.

380
00:27:46,254 --> 00:27:48,593
I'm a bigger person than you.
I have a bigger heart than you.

381
00:27:48,594 --> 00:27:50,723
My birthday is probably earlier
than yours.

382
00:27:50,724 --> 00:27:52,884
That's right. I am your Oppa.

383
00:27:53,404 --> 00:27:56,353
Why do you suddenly want to be my Oppa?

384
00:27:56,354 --> 00:27:58,734
You don't have an Oppa,
and I don't have a little sister.

385
00:27:59,544 --> 00:28:01,754
I'm just saying you can think of me
as an older brother.

386
00:28:02,644 --> 00:28:06,124
All right... Oppa.

387
00:28:07,914 --> 00:28:09,274
Satisfied?

388
00:28:10,234 --> 00:28:11,804
That's not bad.

389
00:28:31,234 --> 00:28:32,713
<i>Take a digestive before sleeping.</i>

390
00:28:32,714 --> 00:28:34,504
<i>You went overboard with the food earlier.</i>

391
00:28:38,624 --> 00:28:40,064
<i>Thanks.</i>

392
00:28:45,344 --> 00:28:49,384
I never have anything to say to him
but "thanks".

393
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:56,724
<i>Okay, sleep well.</i>

394
00:29:02,804 --> 00:29:04,364
<i>Thanks.</i>

395
00:29:13,254 --> 00:29:14,514
<i>Yes, Yi Jin.</i>

396
00:29:15,414 --> 00:29:17,273
What are you doing?

397
00:29:17,274 --> 00:29:20,334
I'm at the K Society meeting.
It's my turn this quarter.

398
00:29:20,654 --> 00:29:21,854
Oh...

399
00:29:23,074 --> 00:29:26,154
So, what is going on with our problem?

400
00:29:26,734 --> 00:29:29,573
Why didn't you contact me again?

401
00:29:29,574 --> 00:29:33,123
Like I told you, I'm looking at various
methods of figuring out the issue.

402
00:29:33,124 --> 00:29:37,303
These various methods that you're
looking at...

403
00:29:37,304 --> 00:29:41,573
when, where, and how
will I hear about them from you?

404
00:29:41,574 --> 00:29:44,693
More important than anything,
these methods to resolve the issue

405
00:29:44,694 --> 00:29:49,693
have to appeal to both my household
and Woocheon University at the same time.

406
00:29:49,694 --> 00:29:51,844
You do know this, don't you?

407
00:29:52,994 --> 00:29:55,194
Have you always been
this kind of woman, Yi Jin?

408
00:29:55,634 --> 00:29:57,194
This kind of woman...

409
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:01,444
"This kind of woman"?
What do you mean by that?

410
00:30:01,794 --> 00:30:04,443
You never used to inquire
about details like this.

411
00:30:04,444 --> 00:30:08,484
You're not acting in a manner
that allows me to leave you be.

412
00:30:10,724 --> 00:30:13,314
I need to go now, so I'll call you later.

413
00:30:15,294 --> 00:30:16,394
Wait...

414
00:30:20,724 --> 00:30:22,814
- Nice to see you all.
- Hello.

415
00:30:28,974 --> 00:30:31,003
Why didn't Professor Kim Yi Jin come?

416
00:30:31,004 --> 00:30:33,143
I'm not sure.
I guess she's busy with school work.

417
00:30:33,144 --> 00:30:35,503
Professor Kim Woo Chul,
it's been a long time.

418
00:30:35,504 --> 00:30:38,163
You were often too busy writing
your papers to come out.

419
00:30:38,164 --> 00:30:39,693
I almost didn't make it this month either.

420
00:30:39,694 --> 00:30:42,963
He's working on the manuscript revision
for Acta Psychologica.

421
00:30:42,964 --> 00:30:44,313
But I dragged him here.

422
00:30:44,314 --> 00:30:48,193
Acta Psychologica,
that famous international journal?

423
00:30:48,194 --> 00:30:50,293
My manuscript has been accepted already.

424
00:30:50,294 --> 00:30:53,843
I'm sure it's very difficult to get
your paper published in that journal.

425
00:30:53,844 --> 00:30:56,923
Because it's difficult, it's more
meaningful to challenge it every year.

426
00:30:56,924 --> 00:30:59,083
Did Professor Lindemann recommend you?

427
00:30:59,084 --> 00:31:00,133
No, not at all.

428
00:31:00,134 --> 00:31:03,943
If he comes to the conference in
Seoul this month, I'll give him an update.

429
00:31:03,944 --> 00:31:06,283
Either way, this guy Kim Woo Chul...

430
00:31:06,284 --> 00:31:09,873
In Germany, he was more diligent
than the Germans.

431
00:31:09,874 --> 00:31:12,483
He's diligent to a fault.

432
00:31:12,484 --> 00:31:13,613
What are you saying?

433
00:31:13,614 --> 00:31:16,213
If you didn't go to Woocheon University

434
00:31:16,214 --> 00:31:18,343
you could've ended up
at Jahcheon University.

435
00:31:18,344 --> 00:31:20,343
What? Jahcheon University?

436
00:31:20,344 --> 00:31:22,103
Over there. You see Doctor Ja?

437
00:31:22,104 --> 00:31:25,593
Doctor Ja's father in law is a psychology
professor at Jahcheon University.

438
00:31:25,594 --> 00:31:27,533
Apparently, his health is failing.

439
00:31:27,534 --> 00:31:30,774
And he's about to retire
and emigrate to New Zealand.

440
00:31:31,494 --> 00:31:33,393
And they will have
a faculty position open?

441
00:31:33,394 --> 00:31:37,644
Officially, not yet.
But he'll make the decision soon.

442
00:31:38,094 --> 00:31:40,394
Such a shame, Kim Woo Chul.

443
00:31:41,304 --> 00:31:43,424
Jahcheon University.

444
00:31:46,014 --> 00:31:47,754
Jahcheon University, huh.

445
00:31:49,244 --> 00:31:50,973
It's somewhere around here.

446
00:31:50,974 --> 00:31:53,413
I don't see it. Maybe it's gone now?

447
00:31:53,414 --> 00:31:56,194
It was on the foodie blog a few days ago.

448
00:31:58,624 --> 00:32:02,494
This is the Myungjin building,
and this is the convenience store. So...

449
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:15,873
<i>Most college students these days
also work part-time.</i>

450
00:32:15,874 --> 00:32:17,753
<i>There are students who work more.</i>

451
00:32:17,754 --> 00:32:19,314
She works at a convenience store?

452
00:32:19,814 --> 00:32:21,174
What did you say?

453
00:32:24,814 --> 00:32:28,524
- Come this way.
- Why? Why, why?

454
00:32:29,004 --> 00:32:32,133
I'm sorry, Hye Mi.
I forgot about something urgent.

455
00:32:32,134 --> 00:32:33,163
What?

456
00:32:33,164 --> 00:32:35,463
Let's go for dessert next time. Sorry.

457
00:32:35,464 --> 00:32:36,813
I have to go.

458
00:32:36,814 --> 00:32:38,193
What...

459
00:32:38,194 --> 00:32:41,894
Hey, Kim Min Soo! Hey! Hey!

460
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:53,153
Why are you home at this hour again?
Shouldn't you be at a library?

461
00:32:53,154 --> 00:32:55,153
I need to talk to you.

462
00:32:55,154 --> 00:32:57,443
You haven't heard me properly.

463
00:32:57,444 --> 00:33:00,284
- When you become an adult legally...
- Did you know Mom's been working?

464
00:33:01,124 --> 00:33:03,943
Oh, that. That's nothing.

465
00:33:03,944 --> 00:33:06,213
She's just doing easy work
at her friend's office.

466
00:33:06,214 --> 00:33:07,994
She's working at a convenience store too.

467
00:33:09,424 --> 00:33:11,463
At a convenience store?

468
00:33:11,464 --> 00:33:13,373
You two can do whatever you want
about the divorce.

469
00:33:13,374 --> 00:33:15,533
But you should pay for Mom's tuition.

470
00:33:15,534 --> 00:33:18,274
She couldn't go to college before
because of you!

471
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:22,834
Where... where is that convenience store?

472
00:33:34,084 --> 00:33:37,213
Auntie, how many leftover
triangle kimbaps do we have?

473
00:33:37,214 --> 00:33:40,313
Three.
I left them under the cash register.

474
00:33:40,314 --> 00:33:42,983
You should take them home.

475
00:33:42,984 --> 00:33:44,294
Okay.

476
00:33:44,694 --> 00:33:47,064
I got free lunch for tomorrow.

477
00:33:48,864 --> 00:33:50,703
What did you just say?

478
00:33:50,704 --> 00:33:53,603
How dare you tell her to take home
some leftover triangle kimbap.

479
00:33:53,604 --> 00:33:55,654
"Auntie"? Who are you calling "Auntie"?

480
00:33:57,694 --> 00:33:58,973
Min Soo's Dad!

481
00:33:58,974 --> 00:34:01,193
Who are you again?

482
00:34:01,194 --> 00:34:03,293
Me? I'm her husband.

483
00:34:03,294 --> 00:34:06,873
Who do you think she is for you
to treat her so poorly?

484
00:34:06,874 --> 00:34:09,233
What are you doing?

485
00:34:09,234 --> 00:34:10,384
Come out right now.

486
00:34:11,524 --> 00:34:13,543
Why is Kim Woo Chul's wife here
being mistreated?

487
00:34:13,544 --> 00:34:15,773
You're Professor Kim Woo Chul's wife!

488
00:34:15,774 --> 00:34:17,924
Yeah, right...
A professor's wife.

489
00:34:18,344 --> 00:34:20,983
What did you just say?

490
00:34:20,984 --> 00:34:25,983
Would a professor's wife care so much
about an hourly wage and leftover kimbaps?

491
00:34:25,984 --> 00:34:28,153
I'm sure her husband
doesn't make good money.

492
00:34:28,154 --> 00:34:29,324
What?

493
00:34:30,254 --> 00:34:32,364
You rotten bastard!

494
00:34:50,574 --> 00:34:54,004
Here. I'm sure you can buy 20 of those
with this money.

495
00:34:57,484 --> 00:35:00,113
Who do you think you are,
getting me fired?

496
00:35:00,114 --> 00:35:01,983
I said I'll give you the money.

497
00:35:01,984 --> 00:35:03,463
Look at that person.

498
00:35:03,464 --> 00:35:05,523
He doesn't believe that you're a wife
of a professor.

499
00:35:05,524 --> 00:35:08,323
You doing this makes me look bad.

500
00:35:08,324 --> 00:35:11,753
I am not a wife of a professor.

501
00:35:11,754 --> 00:35:14,273
I am not Kim Woo Chul's wife.

502
00:35:14,274 --> 00:35:17,443
We agreed to get divorced, Min Soo's Dad.

503
00:35:17,444 --> 00:35:19,673
It hasn't been legally finalized.

504
00:35:19,674 --> 00:35:21,173
What?

505
00:35:21,174 --> 00:35:26,314
Until it's finalized legally...
Yes, you're my responsibility.

506
00:35:27,214 --> 00:35:29,363
I'm not a kid.

507
00:35:29,364 --> 00:35:32,904
And between adults, why would one
be someone else's responsibility?

508
00:35:33,294 --> 00:35:36,793
If you take your responsibility further,
you'll end up killing someone.

509
00:35:36,794 --> 00:35:38,003
What?

510
00:35:38,004 --> 00:35:41,463
I am now my own responsibility.

511
00:35:41,464 --> 00:35:44,044
How can you make a living
working at a convenience store?

512
00:35:44,364 --> 00:35:48,444
Oh, by chance, did Producer Cha say
he'll pay for your living?

513
00:35:49,634 --> 00:35:54,093
If you're considering divorce because
you think you can trust Producer Cha

514
00:35:54,094 --> 00:35:56,364
that really is a huge miscalculation
on your part.

515
00:35:56,794 --> 00:35:59,233
You really are too much.

516
00:35:59,234 --> 00:36:02,673
Were you always this difficult
to get through to?

517
00:36:02,674 --> 00:36:04,073
What?

518
00:36:04,074 --> 00:36:06,563
Forget it. You should leave.

519
00:36:06,564 --> 00:36:09,024
Just get in the car. Let's talk at home.

520
00:36:14,134 --> 00:36:15,504
That woman...

521
00:36:23,754 --> 00:36:25,423
Guess who.

522
00:36:25,424 --> 00:36:27,894
Why were you so late?

523
00:36:28,254 --> 00:36:29,304
Hey you!

524
00:36:54,044 --> 00:36:56,064
- Ha No Ra!
- Please, just...

525
00:36:58,704 --> 00:37:00,404
It was Hyun Suk...

526
00:37:01,324 --> 00:37:04,834
It was definitely Cha Hyun Suk.

527
00:37:14,144 --> 00:37:15,854
Who is it, at this hour?

528
00:37:17,404 --> 00:37:19,184
It's me, No Ra.

529
00:37:19,704 --> 00:37:20,784
No Ra?

530
00:37:33,524 --> 00:37:34,914
Is something going on?

531
00:37:36,204 --> 00:37:38,304
I have something to ask you.

532
00:37:40,544 --> 00:37:42,793
Oh, why don't you come in?

533
00:37:42,794 --> 00:37:45,994
No. I can ask from here.

534
00:37:48,904 --> 00:37:50,474
Did you by chance...

535
00:37:51,004 --> 00:37:55,264
You remember the Massa Maren show?

536
00:37:57,874 --> 00:38:00,784
Did you see Min Soo's dad?

537
00:38:05,104 --> 00:38:06,474
Did you?

538
00:38:09,024 --> 00:38:11,494
He wasn't alone...

539
00:38:12,894 --> 00:38:16,014
He was with someone else.

540
00:38:17,264 --> 00:38:18,604
Did you see that?

541
00:38:20,804 --> 00:38:22,084
You did, didn't you?

542
00:38:26,424 --> 00:38:29,674
Yes... I did.

543
00:38:33,804 --> 00:38:34,994
So you did.

544
00:38:37,694 --> 00:38:39,754
That's why you acted that way.

545
00:38:40,524 --> 00:38:41,624
Towards me...

546
00:38:41,934 --> 00:38:43,383
No Ra, the thing is...

547
00:38:43,384 --> 00:38:45,364
You must have found it pretty amusing.

548
00:38:47,444 --> 00:38:51,824
Seeing me running away after
seeing my husband with another woman.

549
00:38:53,394 --> 00:38:54,424
What?

550
00:38:54,784 --> 00:38:58,683
Why didn't you tell me earlier
that you knew about it?

551
00:38:58,684 --> 00:39:02,443
Why do you have to embarrass me like this?

552
00:39:02,444 --> 00:39:07,303
So, this is why you were suddenly
being a good friend to me.

553
00:39:07,304 --> 00:39:09,553
You disliked me so much before.

554
00:39:09,554 --> 00:39:11,204
You felt sorry for me.

555
00:39:12,164 --> 00:39:14,423
Come in. Let's talk inside.

556
00:39:14,424 --> 00:39:16,264
Forget it!

557
00:39:23,514 --> 00:39:26,984
Ha No Ra... No Ra!

558
00:39:29,824 --> 00:39:31,724
That's not why!

559
00:39:38,704 --> 00:39:40,924
No Ra... Ha No Ra!

560
00:39:47,934 --> 00:39:49,234
No Ra.

561
00:39:51,044 --> 00:39:52,404
No Ra!

562
00:39:56,264 --> 00:39:57,673
<i>Don't you understand?</i>

563
00:39:57,674 --> 00:39:59,404
I helped you because I felt sorry for you.

564
00:39:59,614 --> 00:40:01,943
Because you felt sorry for me?

565
00:40:01,944 --> 00:40:05,353
In other words, it was pity.

566
00:40:05,354 --> 00:40:09,354
If I didn't think you were dying,
I never would have put on a show.

567
00:40:12,254 --> 00:40:13,893
You're damaging my belongings!

568
00:40:13,894 --> 00:40:16,294
You can bill me for the damage!

569
00:40:19,124 --> 00:40:21,433
<i>I want you to quit your job here
and work in my office.</i>

570
00:40:21,434 --> 00:40:24,774
<i>I need help with my project,
so come and help me out.</i>

571
00:40:25,604 --> 00:40:26,984
Let's work together.

572
00:40:40,894 --> 00:40:42,914
Yi Jin, let's take my car.

573
00:40:43,314 --> 00:40:44,364
Wait...

574
00:40:49,504 --> 00:40:52,343
<i>Am I supposed to drag you with me
when your husband is there?</i>

575
00:40:52,344 --> 00:40:56,074
You'd want to go with your husband,
not me.

576
00:41:13,114 --> 00:41:18,484
I must have looked...
so stupid.

577
00:41:34,024 --> 00:41:36,024
Senior, I have coffee.

578
00:41:36,944 --> 00:41:38,994
Why is he coming down so late today?

579
00:41:40,954 --> 00:41:42,444
<i>[Ha No Ra]</i>

580
00:41:44,384 --> 00:41:46,234
Why are you calling so early today?

581
00:41:47,194 --> 00:41:51,074
I won't be able to go in anymore, Sang Ye.

582
00:41:51,564 --> 00:41:54,904
I'm sorry I couldn't give you
notice earlier.

583
00:41:55,784 --> 00:41:59,364
Why can't you come?
Are you saying you're quitting?

584
00:42:05,744 --> 00:42:07,284
Ha No Ra?

585
00:42:09,664 --> 00:42:11,484
Is she quitting?

586
00:42:11,824 --> 00:42:13,243
What happened?

587
00:42:13,244 --> 00:42:15,034
Why is she acting this way?

588
00:42:15,464 --> 00:42:18,754
Who am I that she'd care so much
and quit this job?

589
00:42:19,434 --> 00:42:21,574
If she doesn't work, what will she do?

590
00:42:26,184 --> 00:42:27,654
<i>[Ha No Ra]</i>

591
00:42:38,574 --> 00:42:40,694
<i>[Cha Hyun Suk]</i>

<i>[Part-time Job World]</i>

593
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:32,364
I'm the one who told you about this path.

594
00:43:35,434 --> 00:43:37,303
Ha No Ra, are you seriously
going to be this way?

595
00:43:37,304 --> 00:43:40,954
You just got used to the office work.
How can you quit like this?

596
00:43:41,804 --> 00:43:43,993
You know why I'm doing this.

597
00:43:43,994 --> 00:43:45,283
What's the big deal?

598
00:43:45,284 --> 00:43:47,534
There are all sorts of things
happening in the world.

599
00:43:49,844 --> 00:43:51,693
Would you have said anything
if it were you?

600
00:43:51,694 --> 00:43:54,364
I said nothing because I'm your friend.

601
00:43:54,714 --> 00:43:58,274
Seeing you avoid me out of embarrassment
like this is actually hurtful to me.

602
00:43:59,004 --> 00:44:02,503
I'm just uncomfortable about it.
Find someone to replace me.

603
00:44:02,504 --> 00:44:04,593
We have auditions this evening.

604
00:44:04,594 --> 00:44:06,714
Who can we find to replace you?
You have to do it.

605
00:44:09,784 --> 00:44:10,933
Hello?

606
00:44:10,934 --> 00:44:13,853
<i>Ha No Ra? It's Kim Yi Jin.</i>

607
00:44:13,854 --> 00:44:15,824
Ah... yes.

608
00:44:18,724 --> 00:44:23,484
<i>I wanted to tell you about the part-time
job I told you about last time.</i>

609
00:44:24,484 --> 00:44:25,953
Hold on one moment.

610
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:28,494
I have to go meet someone.

611
00:44:29,444 --> 00:44:32,013
Yes, please continue.

612
00:44:32,014 --> 00:44:33,254
I'll be waiting.

613
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:35,194
Come to the office!

614
00:44:38,924 --> 00:44:40,594
What am I going to do with you?

615
00:44:49,774 --> 00:44:52,683
Kim Min Soo, why are you acting this way?

616
00:44:52,684 --> 00:44:53,793
I said I'll tell you later.

617
00:44:53,794 --> 00:44:57,093
When will that be? How long should I
wait around not knowing anything?

618
00:44:57,094 --> 00:44:59,573
We were fine going to the dessert cafe,
and suddenly you ran off.

619
00:44:59,574 --> 00:45:01,323
You've been weird lately.

620
00:45:01,324 --> 00:45:03,333
Even when we're together,
you're not really here.

621
00:45:03,334 --> 00:45:06,333
I need to know what it is
in order to help or be patient.

622
00:45:06,334 --> 00:45:07,393
It's nothing.

623
00:45:07,394 --> 00:45:09,674
If it's nothing, why won't you tell me?

624
00:45:12,094 --> 00:45:15,283
It has nothing to do with you,
and it's my problem.

625
00:45:15,284 --> 00:45:18,343
Once time passes
and I organize my thoughts

626
00:45:18,344 --> 00:45:20,463
I'll tell you everything then. Okay?

627
00:45:20,464 --> 00:45:22,173
What am I to you?

628
00:45:22,174 --> 00:45:25,533
If we're a couple, shouldn't we share
everything and do it all together?

629
00:45:25,534 --> 00:45:28,434
- What is it?
- It's not your problem!

630
00:45:30,424 --> 00:45:33,373
Hye Mi... I didn't mean that.

631
00:45:33,374 --> 00:45:35,644
Hey, young couple.

632
00:45:39,614 --> 00:45:42,264
Young lady with the denim dress.

633
00:45:43,334 --> 00:45:47,083
When a man has a problem,
they recede into a cave.

634
00:45:47,084 --> 00:45:49,383
They need time to think alone.

635
00:45:49,384 --> 00:45:52,183
If you leave him alone,
he'll come out on his own eventually.

636
00:45:52,184 --> 00:45:54,803
Don't try to know too much, and just wait.

637
00:45:54,804 --> 00:45:56,613
And you in the white sweater.

638
00:45:56,614 --> 00:46:00,663
Your girlfriend is asking you to
acknowledge her loneliness and hardship.

639
00:46:00,664 --> 00:46:04,833
If a man doesn't say anything,
women will imagine the very worst.

640
00:46:04,834 --> 00:46:07,893
If you ignore your girlfriend just because
you're having a hard time

641
00:46:07,894 --> 00:46:09,734
of course she'll feel hurt.

642
00:46:16,104 --> 00:46:19,454
These are the ways in which men and women
differ from one another.

643
00:46:22,324 --> 00:46:23,944
It's very hard.

644
00:46:31,964 --> 00:46:33,303
You heard him, right?

645
00:46:33,304 --> 00:46:37,034
Don't fall into your own thoughts
and lose me on the way.

646
00:46:44,664 --> 00:46:47,403
My friend is in charge of a gallery.

647
00:46:47,404 --> 00:46:51,043
Next month, they are planning
a large scale exhibition.

648
00:46:51,044 --> 00:46:54,484
It's a project assistant job
that should last about a month.

649
00:46:55,154 --> 00:46:59,013
Why are you helping me get a job?

650
00:46:59,014 --> 00:47:03,434
Well, that's because...
You do work part-time jobs.

651
00:47:04,064 --> 00:47:07,263
Why do you work part-time jobs, anyways?

652
00:47:07,264 --> 00:47:09,433
Do you plan to continue working?

653
00:47:09,434 --> 00:47:12,333
Are you doing it for independence?

654
00:47:12,334 --> 00:47:13,824
Kim Yi Jin.

655
00:47:14,674 --> 00:47:16,554
You're going through a tough time,
aren't you?

656
00:47:16,794 --> 00:47:17,913
Pardon?

657
00:47:17,914 --> 00:47:19,973
You don't need to do this.

658
00:47:19,974 --> 00:47:23,303
What kind of person I am,
why I'm working jobs...

659
00:47:23,304 --> 00:47:25,334
Or why I'm attending college...

660
00:47:25,974 --> 00:47:28,014
None of that is important.

661
00:47:28,494 --> 00:47:30,853
What do you mean...

662
00:47:30,854 --> 00:47:32,534
Kim Woo Chul.

663
00:47:33,564 --> 00:47:34,984
You can have him.

664
00:47:38,854 --> 00:47:39,914
What?

665
00:47:40,684 --> 00:47:44,424
I know why you are doing this.

666
00:47:48,164 --> 00:47:50,044
I know who you are, too.

667
00:47:52,844 --> 00:47:57,064
We run into each other often,
even in restrooms.

668
00:47:57,584 --> 00:47:58,763
Yes.

669
00:47:58,764 --> 00:47:59,883
<i>[Cousin]</i>

670
00:47:59,884 --> 00:48:02,014
You must be close to your cousin.

671
00:48:14,394 --> 00:48:16,854
Oh, okay. I'll call you again.

672
00:48:18,434 --> 00:48:24,224
Ha No Ra, why are you working
in Producer Cha's office?

673
00:48:24,524 --> 00:48:26,184
Because I need money.

674
00:48:26,744 --> 00:48:31,553
Then are you open to working
another part-time job?

675
00:48:31,554 --> 00:48:35,353
As long as the time
doesn't conflict with my jobs now.

676
00:48:35,354 --> 00:48:40,364
Then I'll find out the specifics on time
and contact you again.

677
00:48:40,744 --> 00:48:41,824
Okay.

678
00:48:53,964 --> 00:48:55,474
<i>[Cousin 010-275-017]</i>

679
00:48:59,764 --> 00:49:04,654
<i>[Min Soo's Dad 010-275-017]</i>

680
00:49:22,164 --> 00:49:24,174
- Thank you.
- No problem.

681
00:49:26,744 --> 00:49:28,923
Hye Mi, Hye Mi! Help me out.

682
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:30,134
Hurry, hurry!

683
00:49:43,634 --> 00:49:47,233
What exactly are you talking about?

684
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:52,354
Your cousin's phone number and
Kim Woo Chul's number are the same.

685
00:49:55,284 --> 00:50:00,834
Also... why do you keep asking me
so many questions?

686
00:50:01,474 --> 00:50:04,314
Haven't you heard from Kim Woo Chul?

687
00:50:04,654 --> 00:50:07,754
We've decided to go to court.

688
00:50:08,074 --> 00:50:11,284
You've decided to go to court?

689
00:50:11,934 --> 00:50:13,544
When?

690
00:50:13,554 --> 00:50:15,773
He told me he needs to submit
a family information certificate

691
00:50:15,774 --> 00:50:17,983
by the end of July.

692
00:50:17,984 --> 00:50:19,903
So, we've pushed it till then.

693
00:50:19,904 --> 00:50:22,384
A family information certificate?

694
00:50:22,824 --> 00:50:27,904
I was told there's a personnel committee
meeting for new professors.

695
00:50:28,294 --> 00:50:30,744
Personnel committee meeting?

696
00:50:57,814 --> 00:50:59,684
"You can have him"?

697
00:51:00,114 --> 00:51:02,033
"You can have him"?

698
00:51:02,034 --> 00:51:04,824
She said "you can have him".
This is so absurd!

699
00:51:06,064 --> 00:51:07,803
She doesn't need him, and I can have him.

700
00:51:07,804 --> 00:51:09,684
Kim Woo Chul...

701
00:51:10,104 --> 00:51:12,784
He said she came to college for him.

702
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:15,533
Oh, gosh!

703
00:51:15,534 --> 00:51:17,693
Yes, Professor Lindemann.

704
00:51:17,694 --> 00:51:20,384
I'll make a reservation at the hotel.

705
00:51:21,714 --> 00:51:24,464
I'm eager to meet you, as well.

706
00:51:36,994 --> 00:51:40,384
I heard that there is no
personnel committee meeting.

707
00:51:40,944 --> 00:51:41,994
What?

708
00:51:42,394 --> 00:51:45,203
I just met Kim Yi Jin before coming here.

709
00:51:45,204 --> 00:51:47,144
Didn't she call you?

710
00:51:47,774 --> 00:51:49,403
You met who?

711
00:51:49,404 --> 00:51:53,094
Your woman...
Professor Kim Yi Jin.

712
00:51:56,154 --> 00:52:00,863
I don't even want to know why you
lied and pushed back the divorce date.

713
00:52:00,864 --> 00:52:05,394
But, I do know that you don't need
a family information certificate.

714
00:52:05,904 --> 00:52:07,313
So, let's go to the courthouse now.

715
00:52:07,314 --> 00:52:08,863
No, no. Wait.

716
00:52:08,864 --> 00:52:11,854
I told Kim Yi Jin everything.

717
00:52:12,284 --> 00:52:13,964
I told her that we're getting a divorce.

718
00:52:14,154 --> 00:52:15,494
How could you...

719
00:52:16,944 --> 00:52:21,433
Let's come back to the context of the
words that are coming out of your mouth.

720
00:52:21,434 --> 00:52:24,043
The reason I used the the personnel
committee meeting as an excuse was

721
00:52:24,044 --> 00:52:26,864
I determined that you needed time
to make the right decision.

722
00:52:26,904 --> 00:52:28,803
Give it a rest now, would you!

723
00:52:28,804 --> 00:52:30,514
Please!

724
00:52:30,944 --> 00:52:34,824
You have narcissistic
personality disorder.

725
00:52:35,274 --> 00:52:36,373
What?

726
00:52:36,374 --> 00:52:38,413
I learned about it psychology class.

727
00:52:38,414 --> 00:52:40,633
You think everything revolves around you.

728
00:52:40,634 --> 00:52:42,964
You rationalize to make things about you,
and alter situations.

729
00:52:43,004 --> 00:52:45,954
Stop that, please!

730
00:52:47,574 --> 00:52:51,343
Min Soo's Dad, please...

731
00:52:51,344 --> 00:52:53,524
Don't push this any further.

732
00:52:55,694 --> 00:52:58,064
I even met up with Professor Kim Yi Jin!

733
00:53:03,214 --> 00:53:04,304
What...

734
00:53:11,434 --> 00:53:13,444
She met Kim Yi Jin?

735
00:53:14,644 --> 00:53:16,004
How did she know?

736
00:53:16,744 --> 00:53:20,474
<i>I took her because Kim Yi Jin
is your woman!</i>

737
00:53:21,214 --> 00:53:25,494
<i>So you need to hurry up
and deal with Kim Yi Jin.</i>

738
00:53:25,874 --> 00:53:28,264
<i>Otherwise, I'll shred you to pieces.</i>

739
00:53:38,474 --> 00:53:40,793
I told you to never
show your face here again.

740
00:53:40,794 --> 00:53:42,844
Why do you say one thing and do another?

741
00:53:43,854 --> 00:53:44,983
What are you doing!

742
00:53:44,984 --> 00:53:47,303
Didn't you say you'll protect
No Ra's family?

743
00:53:47,304 --> 00:53:50,144
And then you tell No Ra about Kim Yi Jin?

744
00:53:51,694 --> 00:53:52,783
What are you...

745
00:53:52,784 --> 00:53:54,903
At the show, it wasn't No Ra
who saw us, right?

746
00:53:54,904 --> 00:53:56,913
You saw us and told her, right?

747
00:53:56,914 --> 00:54:00,884
Cha Hyun Suk, without you, Ha No Ra is not
someone who can behave that way!

748
00:54:01,304 --> 00:54:05,864
How did you coach her, exactly, that she
gave me the divorce papers unprompted?

749
00:54:06,714 --> 00:54:09,044
- Divorce papers?
- Yes.

750
00:54:09,654 --> 00:54:11,274
How did you encourage her?

751
00:54:12,764 --> 00:54:17,304
You probably told her about Kim Yi Jin,
and told her to get a divorce.

752
00:54:18,444 --> 00:54:21,444
No Ra asked for a divorce?
Is that what you're saying?

753
00:54:22,254 --> 00:54:24,354
When? When?

754
00:54:27,084 --> 00:54:30,784
No Ra has decided
to get divorced for real?

755
00:54:47,804 --> 00:54:50,104
What is this?

756
00:54:55,594 --> 00:54:57,094
He didn't know?

757
00:55:02,074 --> 00:55:04,523
Cha Hyun Suk, that punk.

758
00:55:04,524 --> 00:55:06,724
Does this mean
his intentions were sincere?

759
00:55:07,684 --> 00:55:10,644
He genuinely tried to bring
No Ra and me back together?

760
00:55:15,484 --> 00:55:18,914
He has that much affection for her?

761
00:55:44,734 --> 00:55:46,314
<i>[Cha Hyun Suk]</i>

762
00:55:58,304 --> 00:56:02,884
<i>Can't you please pick up? It's urgent.
Please.</i>

763
00:56:05,874 --> 00:56:07,364
<i>[Cha Hyun Suk]</i>

764
00:56:15,504 --> 00:56:16,673
Yes.

765
00:56:16,674 --> 00:56:18,253
<i>You really aren't coming?</i>

766
00:56:18,254 --> 00:56:20,903
<i>It's chaos here with Sang Ye by herself.</i>

767
00:56:20,904 --> 00:56:23,153
I told you I wasn't coming.

768
00:56:23,154 --> 00:56:26,733
<i>I'm really asking you for a favor.
Can you help me out?</i>

769
00:56:26,734 --> 00:56:30,193
<i>Yes, it's straight ahead on that street.</i>

770
00:56:30,194 --> 00:56:32,843
<i>Hey, Ha No Ra, didn't you
say you were my friend?</i>

771
00:56:32,844 --> 00:56:35,243
<i>Didn't you thank me for coming
back to you as a friend?</i>

772
00:56:35,244 --> 00:56:37,824
<i>Even if I faked it?</i>

773
00:56:54,924 --> 00:56:57,123
Goodness, I can breathe now.

774
00:56:57,124 --> 00:57:00,244
- Thank you for coming.
- What should I do?

775
00:57:01,224 --> 00:57:04,893
Put the audition list and the evaluation
form in the file rack.

776
00:57:04,894 --> 00:57:08,523
And the actors auditioning for Jung Hye
and Ji Woo's roles will be here soon.

777
00:57:08,524 --> 00:57:12,203
The scripts are over there, so can you
guide them when they get here?

778
00:57:12,204 --> 00:57:13,474
Okay.

779
00:57:20,754 --> 00:57:22,463
Suddenly one day...

780
00:57:22,464 --> 00:57:25,693
The feeling of not being able to hear the
sound of breathing that was always there.

781
00:57:25,694 --> 00:57:27,653
Do you know what that's like?

782
00:57:27,654 --> 00:57:30,213
When my child fell asleep...

783
00:57:30,214 --> 00:57:32,424
that breathing sound.

784
00:57:33,254 --> 00:57:35,224
Can you go again?

785
00:57:36,024 --> 00:57:37,783
Suddenly one day...

786
00:57:37,784 --> 00:57:41,064
The feeling of not being able to hear the
sound of breathing that was always there.

787
00:57:45,004 --> 00:57:47,114
- Hong So Ra.
- Yes.

788
00:57:48,744 --> 00:57:50,454
You can go in now.

789
00:58:04,884 --> 00:58:06,294
My goodness.

790
00:58:08,004 --> 00:58:10,134
Ha No Ra's body must ache all over.

791
00:58:11,324 --> 00:58:12,974
No, not really.

792
00:58:16,294 --> 00:58:17,844
Good job.

793
00:58:18,804 --> 00:58:20,393
What the...

794
00:58:20,394 --> 00:58:23,164
You worked hard, and you did a good job.

795
00:58:24,454 --> 00:58:25,814
You did very well.

796
00:58:27,194 --> 00:58:28,904
I didn't do much.

797
00:58:29,764 --> 00:58:31,194
Finish up here and come outside.

798
00:58:34,454 --> 00:58:38,014
It wasn't a big deal,
but he says I did well?

799
00:58:46,324 --> 00:58:49,954
It's all right. Why are you coming?

800
00:58:51,114 --> 00:58:52,994
I'm also on my way somewhere.

801
00:58:53,924 --> 00:58:55,903
Then go ahead.

802
00:58:55,904 --> 00:58:57,744
I was going to take the bus too.

803
00:59:00,164 --> 00:59:04,093
Cha Hyun Suk, I came today
because you were in a pinch.

804
00:59:04,094 --> 00:59:05,613
I won't be coming tomorrow, or after.

805
00:59:05,614 --> 00:59:08,813
I've already got another part-time job.

806
00:59:08,814 --> 00:59:11,703
Come on, I heard from Seung Hyun
that you haven't yet.

807
00:59:11,704 --> 00:59:12,754
When?

808
00:59:14,854 --> 00:59:17,054
I got an interview somewhere.

809
00:59:18,124 --> 00:59:20,124
Do you dislike working with me that much?

810
00:59:20,854 --> 00:59:22,443
Stop.

811
00:59:22,444 --> 00:59:25,513
Ha No Ra, do you think
I'm that good of a person?

812
00:59:25,514 --> 00:59:26,983
Don't you remember when we first met?

813
00:59:26,984 --> 00:59:29,213
I'm not that generous of a person.

814
00:59:29,214 --> 00:59:32,683
I don't help people out
just because I'm sympathetic. Ever.

815
00:59:32,684 --> 00:59:36,794
Even when I met you again, and when
I thought you were terminally ill...

816
00:59:37,204 --> 00:59:40,223
Even when I knew your married life
was miserable...

817
00:59:40,224 --> 00:59:42,953
I never pitied you. Not even once.

818
00:59:42,954 --> 00:59:45,914
I'd rather not talk about those things.

819
00:59:47,144 --> 00:59:50,594
You're a very important person to me.

820
00:59:55,924 --> 00:59:57,964
That's why I was good to you.

821
00:59:58,344 --> 01:00:01,644
Because I like you.
I did everything because I wanted to.

822
01:00:03,424 --> 01:00:07,533
All on my own...
I got bothered, I got upset.

823
01:00:07,534 --> 01:00:10,834
And I fretted over it all on my own,
like how I did in the past.

824
01:00:12,924 --> 01:00:16,474
What are you trying to say?

825
01:00:20,724 --> 01:00:21,854
Here.

826
01:00:23,274 --> 01:00:24,863
What is it?

827
01:00:24,864 --> 01:00:26,424
Open it when you get home.

828
01:00:27,394 --> 01:00:29,164
Make sure you open it alone.

829
01:00:29,534 --> 01:00:31,603
What is it though?

830
01:00:31,604 --> 01:00:34,334
Proof that I didn't pity you.

831
01:00:34,914 --> 01:00:38,624
Proof that you're quite the woman.

832
01:00:40,274 --> 01:00:42,114
My precious memories.

833
01:00:43,364 --> 01:00:47,543
Hey, I seriously wanted
to keep this to myself.

834
01:00:47,544 --> 01:00:50,074
But because you're whining so much,
I'm revealing it to you.

835
01:00:51,654 --> 01:00:54,374
So from now on, you can live your life
remembering who you once were.

836
01:00:55,134 --> 01:00:57,923
What exactly is this?

837
01:00:57,924 --> 01:01:01,713
Come ask me how you became
that kind of person to me.

838
01:01:01,714 --> 01:01:03,364
I'll answer you then.

839
01:01:45,024 --> 01:01:46,944
What could this be?

840
01:01:59,704 --> 01:02:03,114
Oh, these are the songs I used to like.

841
01:02:22,824 --> 01:02:25,553
<i>At first, I was happy being your friend.</i>

842
01:02:25,554 --> 01:02:27,094
<i>But that's not the case anymore.</i>

843
01:02:28,184 --> 01:02:31,524
<i>Ha No Ra, I like you.</i>

844
01:02:35,184 --> 01:02:36,384
<i>Ha No Ra.</i>

845
01:02:38,994 --> 01:02:40,634
<i>I like you.</i>

846
01:02:45,624 --> 01:02:53,624
