1
00:01:49,605 --> 00:01:51,844
Hey, Sebbe!

2
00:01:56,855 --> 00:02:02,804
- I'm going to get wasted.
- You said that yesterday!

3
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:05,593
Hey, what's up?

4
00:02:05,814 --> 00:02:09,559
When are you going to play, Sebbe?
It's been ages.

5
00:02:09,772 --> 00:02:13,269
- Isn't it time you got a gig?
- Yeah, yeah, I will.

6
00:02:13,481 --> 00:02:17,557
- You have to work hard to succeed.
- Stop nagging!

7
00:02:17,773 --> 00:02:21,684
- Excuse me, there are two of you?
- Yes.

8
00:02:21,898 --> 00:02:23,272
He doesn't mean us.

9
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:29,012
- Wait 'til I get my record deal.
- Your dad's money'll run out one day!

10
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:31,187
Pay for your own booze!

11
00:02:31,399 --> 00:02:34,480
I should be on the list. Mia Ekström!

12
00:02:34,691 --> 00:02:38,222
I don't have anyone by that name.
Guest list only tonight.

13
00:02:38,441 --> 00:02:42,933
- Let's go somewhere else.
- Please, I hear Stureplan is great!

14
00:02:43,149 --> 00:02:46,313
- And I'm going home tomorrow!
- Excuse me...

15
00:02:46,525 --> 00:02:53,232
- They put me on the list yesterday.
- I'm busy! Try again later.

16
00:02:55,109 --> 00:02:58,439
- Hi
- Hi

17
00:02:58,817 --> 00:03:03,309
But your colleague
promised me... and my friends!

18
00:03:03,526 --> 00:03:07,567
- What, you're together?
- Yes! Why wouldn't you believe that?

19
00:03:07,776 --> 00:03:13,227
- How many in your group?
- Uh... six.

20
00:03:14,818 --> 00:03:19,855
- Okay then. Welcome.
- What happened, Mia?

21
00:03:20,068 --> 00:03:23,932
- What a weird girl!
- Sebbe, help me out here.

22
00:03:24,152 --> 00:03:27,269
Oskar's paying!
The first round, anyway.

23
00:04:01,237 --> 00:04:05,397
- Jesus! Watch your step, hippo!
- Excuse me?!

24
00:04:05,613 --> 00:04:07,899
Just ignore him, honey. We all do.

25
00:04:08,113 --> 00:04:12,320
- Why are you so slow?
- I can't hear you!

26
00:04:39,073 --> 00:04:40,317
Nice voice.

27
00:04:41,407 --> 00:04:43,776
Nice tits.

28
00:05:15,492 --> 00:05:21,441
'Code GRANDMA. Bring breakfast! '

29
00:05:22,159 --> 00:05:26,900
I understand, sweetheart,
but you need to remember,

30
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:30,649
grandma had a good, long life.

31
00:05:30,868 --> 00:05:32,491
- Hi.
- Zup.

32
00:05:32,701 --> 00:05:35,071
She's in a better place now.

33
00:05:35,826 --> 00:05:39,986
Yeah, mom...
I'll try to pull myself together.

34
00:05:40,202 --> 00:05:44,278
I'll come over later.
I need to get the door now.

35
00:05:45,327 --> 00:05:48,361
Hi... Grandma...

36
00:05:48,577 --> 00:05:49,655
What?

37
00:05:49,869 --> 00:05:55,948
She was Norway's most famous
tap dancer, a pioneer in the genre.

38
00:05:57,328 --> 00:06:00,030
And for her to die...

39
00:06:00,245 --> 00:06:05,482
falling down a staircase...
In Stavanger!

40
00:06:05,703 --> 00:06:09,069
- Three flights!
- Wow, that's terrible.

41
00:06:09,287 --> 00:06:12,534
Maybe I should go now...

42
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:18,618
- I'm sorry for your loss.
- Thanks.

43
00:06:21,579 --> 00:06:25,490
- Too much?
- Un poquito.

44
00:06:35,913 --> 00:06:42,195
That bald record producer was here
yesterday looking at the blue blazer.

45
00:06:42,414 --> 00:06:44,321
Hammarsten?

46
00:06:44,539 --> 00:06:47,786
Did you play my demo?

47
00:06:47,997 --> 00:06:52,406
Uh, no, sorry. He wasn't here long.
We didn't have his size.

48
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:58,737
- Shit! I always miss him.
- Didn't they want to sign you once?

49
00:06:58,956 --> 00:07:06,115
I thought so... But they signed some
"Idol" loser with the same "look".

50
00:07:06,332 --> 00:07:12,660
What bullshit. Have you seen anyone
who looks like me on "Idol"?

51
00:07:14,707 --> 00:07:19,412
I suppose I should send in my demo.
Keep in touch.

52
00:07:21,124 --> 00:07:24,905
Hammarsten is awesome;
he's worked with everyone.

53
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:29,368
Hey, why don't you unpack
today's delivery?

54
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:32,996
If his size came in,
you can call him!

55
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:34,582
Sounds fun.

56
00:07:38,084 --> 00:07:42,160
I, uh, put on your demo.

57
00:07:42,376 --> 00:07:46,322
- And he left his card.
- No way!

58
00:07:48,543 --> 00:07:50,498
What the? Wh?

59
00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:55,497
- What did he... Should I?
- Just call him.

60
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:58,494
- Now?!
- Yeah.

61
00:07:59,835 --> 00:08:01,032
Yeah!

62
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:27,700
I need my brows shaped, too.

63
00:08:31,295 --> 00:08:36,795
- Welcome! Can I take your coat?
- No thanks, I just saw my son there.

64
00:08:37,004 --> 00:08:39,291
Sebastian!

65
00:08:39,504 --> 00:08:42,171
- Hi!
- Hi, Mom.

66
00:08:42,379 --> 00:08:45,330
Oh, you're soaking! Heading home?

67
00:08:45,546 --> 00:08:49,540
- No, to the cemetery.
- It's the 20th already?

68
00:08:49,755 --> 00:08:54,045
Yes. He would have been 27 today.
I can wait if you want to come.

69
00:08:54,255 --> 00:08:59,245
No, I have a lot going on tonight,
I won't have time.

70
00:08:59,464 --> 00:09:03,043
- Okay. Were you off today?
- No, I worked...

71
00:09:03,255 --> 00:09:07,463
And I talked to a music producer
who heard my demo!

72
00:09:08,964 --> 00:09:12,496
What did he say?
Have you bought clothes again!

73
00:09:12,714 --> 00:09:17,834
Honey, it's no wonder your paycheck
doesn't last. Really!

74
00:09:18,048 --> 00:09:23,286
He said he'll call later this week
and his label may want to sign me.

75
00:09:23,507 --> 00:09:29,504
- I think it'll happen this time!
- Well, that's good, I guess.

76
00:09:31,049 --> 00:09:34,664
- I've got to go now.
- Can't you tell Dad?

77
00:09:34,882 --> 00:09:37,585
- About what?
- The record label!

78
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:42,338
- Tell him yourself.
- He'll just go on about that job.

79
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:48,664
- Can't you just let him call...
- No, Mom, it's not going to happen.

80
00:09:48,883 --> 00:09:54,299
- You can't be a store clerk forever!
- I'm not a store clerk!

81
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:59,046
I'm getting a record contract!
Stop worrying about me.

82
00:09:59,259 --> 00:10:04,461
I never worry about you.
People like you always get by.

83
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:09,717
- "People like me"?
- Talk to you later!

84
00:10:40,761 --> 00:10:44,625
- What do you think?
- It sounds good.

85
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:48,175
- But?
- Are you planning on working today?

86
00:10:49,804 --> 00:10:53,928
Can you pass me
the labels behind you?

87
00:10:58,179 --> 00:10:59,885
Thanks...

88
00:11:00,096 --> 00:11:04,172
- The head office still bugging you?
- No.

89
00:11:04,388 --> 00:11:08,844
- I'm getting promoted.
- Yeah? To what?

90
00:11:09,055 --> 00:11:14,636
Purchaser for Scandinavia.
I'll work at the head office.

91
00:11:14,847 --> 00:11:20,180
- And attend all the European shows!
- Only the European ones?

92
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:25,548
I'm kidding! That's great!
Why didn't you tell me?

93
00:11:25,764 --> 00:11:27,636
Sweet!

94
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:31,796
- When do you start?
- In June.

95
00:11:32,014 --> 00:11:36,257
That's totally awesome.
You deserve it.

96
00:11:37,306 --> 00:11:41,514
And I'll be stuck here
in the storeroom.

97
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:47,509
Look, I'm sorry, but I can't
work here. I just feel...

98
00:11:49,057 --> 00:11:53,928
- I can't take it!
- Seriously, you don't "work" much.

99
00:11:54,141 --> 00:12:00,008
You mostly just surf on your iPhone.
You haven't worked a full day...

100
00:12:00,224 --> 00:12:02,843
Quiet! Hang on, hang on...

101
00:12:04,058 --> 00:12:06,629
Sebastian.

102
00:12:07,183 --> 00:12:09,340
Hi!

103
00:12:09,725 --> 00:12:11,680
I'm great, thanks.

104
00:12:11,892 --> 00:12:17,225
No, I'm not busy.
I'm actually off work today.

105
00:12:17,434 --> 00:12:22,885
Sure, I'm in the neighborhood anyway.
Great, see you later. Bye.

106
00:12:23,101 --> 00:12:26,513
- YES! The record company!
- What did they say?

107
00:12:26,726 --> 00:12:30,388
- To be there in a half hour!
- Hey! Sebbe!

108
00:12:30,601 --> 00:12:35,935
- The jacket?
- Dock my pay or something.

109
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:43,095
Hi, I'm Jens Hammarsten.

110
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:46,641
I mean, I'm here to see him.
I'm Sebastian Silverberg.

111
00:12:46,852 --> 00:12:48,310
One moment, please.

112
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:52,015
I have a Sebastian Silverberg here.
Okay.

113
00:12:52,228 --> 00:12:57,762
- Around the corner, 4th on the left.
- Fourth door. Thanks.

114
00:13:00,811 --> 00:13:06,595
- Let's keep in touch, Sebbe. Later.
- Bye, uh, later!

115
00:13:38,689 --> 00:13:43,227
- Are you coming? We're freezing!
- Go in! I'm on my way.

116
00:13:43,439 --> 00:13:47,847
- Look, is Pelle there?
- What do you want with him?

117
00:13:48,064 --> 00:13:51,395
Enough with your Norwegian accent!
Give me Pelle!

118
00:13:51,606 --> 00:13:55,931
We're going in.
I'm going to the bar.

119
00:13:56,148 --> 00:13:58,767
Sebbe! Hello?

120
00:13:58,981 --> 00:14:02,596
Hello? He's not there!

121
00:14:02,815 --> 00:14:04,853
- Hello?
- Yes! Congrats!

122
00:14:05,065 --> 00:14:09,189
- A contract, that's sweet, man!
- I know.

123
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:13,096
It's incredible. And it's about time!

124
00:14:13,316 --> 00:14:19,976
- Is it a done deal? Have you signed?
- I need a lawyer to check it first.

125
00:14:20,191 --> 00:14:25,181
- I wondered if you could help me?
- Of course!

126
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,766
Hey, I see a taxi.
Tonight's going to be awesome!

127
00:15:10,277 --> 00:15:12,731
Hello?

128
00:15:15,694 --> 00:15:18,230
Hello?

129
00:15:19,195 --> 00:15:22,062
Can someone help me?

130
00:15:23,445 --> 00:15:28,398
Hello!? Can someone help me?!

131
00:15:29,904 --> 00:15:33,269
Hello!? Hello!?

132
00:15:44,154 --> 00:15:47,520
Can you see the light?

133
00:15:48,571 --> 00:15:50,443
No.

134
00:15:51,322 --> 00:15:54,438
- Now?
- No.

135
00:15:55,363 --> 00:15:58,362
- Now?
- No.

136
00:15:58,989 --> 00:16:02,650
- And now?
- No.

137
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:08,938
- Does your head hurt?
- Yes, back here.

138
00:16:10,406 --> 00:16:14,234
- The back of your head?
- Yeah... or sort of everywhere.

139
00:16:14,448 --> 00:16:19,319
Let me take a look at the other eye.
Do you see the light now?

140
00:16:19,532 --> 00:16:23,905
No! I don't see any fucking light!
What the hell is wrong?!

141
00:16:24,115 --> 00:16:28,524
Stop crying, Mom! What's wrong?!
Don't touch me!

142
00:16:47,783 --> 00:16:52,156
Your son had an aneurysm.

143
00:16:52,367 --> 00:16:59,110
The fall caused it to burst, and the
bleeding damaged the visual cortex.

144
00:17:00,117 --> 00:17:03,898
It was a time bomb,

145
00:17:04,118 --> 00:17:07,483
just waiting to go off.

146
00:17:07,701 --> 00:17:12,608
But he will be able
to see again, right?

147
00:17:12,826 --> 00:17:16,737
- He will get his sight back?
- I'm sorry.

148
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:22,237
It's highly unlikely
that it will return naturally.

149
00:17:23,327 --> 00:17:27,238
The good news is that
Sebastian is being treated,

150
00:17:27,452 --> 00:17:30,071
so he's in no danger.

151
00:17:30,286 --> 00:17:35,239
- So what do we do now?
- We wait.

152
00:17:35,453 --> 00:17:39,233
- Wait? For what?
- To see if his condition changes.

153
00:17:39,453 --> 00:17:46,114
And seek new treatments. There's
progress all the time in this field.

154
00:17:50,037 --> 00:17:53,734
We'll keep searching.
We can't just do nothing.

155
00:17:53,954 --> 00:17:56,443
I refuse to accept this!

156
00:17:56,662 --> 00:18:00,491
You heard the doctor,
his condition may change.

157
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:44,744
It's pretty cozy in here.

158
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,282
For a while.

159
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:57,821
- Have you heard from Hammarsten?
- No, that's over.

160
00:18:58,041 --> 00:19:00,446
What? Why?

161
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:07,113
I don't know. I got a letter
"on behalf of Jens Hammarsten."

162
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:11,991
- He didn't even call me himself.
- What a fucking fake.

163
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:19,332
But you're a singer.
You don't need to see to be a star.

164
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:23,204
Look at Ray Charles,
or Stevie Wonder, or...

165
00:19:23,418 --> 00:19:26,581
- Youssou N'dour.
- What do you mean, Youssou N'dour?

166
00:19:26,793 --> 00:19:29,910
The guy who sings
"Seven Seconds Away."

167
00:19:30,126 --> 00:19:33,457
- He's not blind.
- He's not?

168
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,492
We're going out tonight.
Want to come?

169
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,701
Oh come on!

170
00:19:44,627 --> 00:19:49,249
You going to drag me around
like a seeing-eye dog?

171
00:19:49,461 --> 00:19:51,451
I'm stuck here!

172
00:19:51,669 --> 00:19:56,741
My parents got me an assistant
to help me with my "daily life."

173
00:19:58,128 --> 00:20:02,750
- What daily life? I have no life.
- Of course you do!

174
00:20:02,962 --> 00:20:07,335
Come on, Sebbe! Come out with us
tonight. I'll look after you.

175
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:16,083
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

176
00:20:16,296 --> 00:20:18,500
Cheers!

177
00:20:20,879 --> 00:20:26,165
The best way to get over a girl
is to "get over" another girl.

178
00:20:27,463 --> 00:20:31,788
- Did you get that Sebbe?
- Why don't you sing something?

179
00:20:32,005 --> 00:20:33,830
- What?
- Cheers!

180
00:21:10,507 --> 00:21:13,292
Erik!

181
00:21:13,507 --> 00:21:16,292
Erik! Erik!

182
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:26,088
Sorry.

183
00:21:31,342 --> 00:21:32,965
Sorry, sorry!

184
00:21:49,551 --> 00:21:51,589
Erik! Erik!

185
00:21:54,427 --> 00:21:56,796
Erik! Erik!

186
00:22:09,469 --> 00:22:12,136
- Fucking drunk. Get out of here!
- You OK?

187
00:22:12,344 --> 00:22:16,801
- He's not drunk, he's blind!
- Sure he is...

188
00:22:17,011 --> 00:22:21,005
What are you laughing at?
You think this is funny?

189
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:24,799
Get me a cab. Get me a cab!

190
00:22:38,221 --> 00:22:42,511
- At Gmail?
...dot com, yes.

191
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:56,384
- What's your password?
- donkeyballs84.

192
00:22:57,847 --> 00:23:01,426
No, there's nothing interesting here.

193
00:23:01,639 --> 00:23:05,336
- Invitations to night clubs...
- Delete.

194
00:23:05,556 --> 00:23:10,213
And you've got mail from Oskar
af Ström-de Luca and Pelle Borg.

195
00:23:10,431 --> 00:23:14,888
- They wonder why you never call.
- Delete those too.

196
00:23:16,973 --> 00:23:20,635
Straight ahead, straight...
You know the way.

197
00:23:21,598 --> 00:23:27,512
You're a meter from the couch.
Watch out for the rug.

198
00:23:29,557 --> 00:23:33,882
Cool!
This is some place you've got.

199
00:23:39,349 --> 00:23:42,550
- Are you bringing the guitar?
- No.

200
00:23:42,766 --> 00:23:46,428
- The amp?
- No.

201
00:23:55,975 --> 00:24:01,427
- You collect watches?
- Nah, I just like them.

202
00:24:01,642 --> 00:24:03,680
You can tell a lot
from a person's watch.

203
00:24:03,893 --> 00:24:07,839
Mine came free with a tank of gas.

204
00:24:09,851 --> 00:24:13,134
That says a lot about me, doesn't it?

205
00:24:19,102 --> 00:24:23,510
I can help you post them on eBay
if you like. They'd be worth a lot.

206
00:24:23,727 --> 00:24:30,435
- Why would I sell my watches?
- Oh, uh... I thought that now...

207
00:24:31,978 --> 00:24:35,841
You want some coffee?
I'll go to 7-Eleven.

208
00:24:36,061 --> 00:24:38,550
Yeah.

209
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:42,844
I'll be back soon.

210
00:25:54,066 --> 00:25:56,934
- Good morning!
- Hello.

211
00:25:58,524 --> 00:25:59,804
Hi.

212
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:05,561
I brought my guitar.
I thought maybe we could jam.

213
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:11,309
- Shall we play?
- Nah, I thought I'd get dressed.

214
00:26:11,525 --> 00:26:15,602
- I think it would be good for you.
- I don't feel like it.

215
00:26:15,817 --> 00:26:20,309
You don't have to see the strings.
It's in your muscle memory.

216
00:26:20,526 --> 00:26:24,436
I have a friend who works
at the music school.

217
00:26:24,651 --> 00:26:28,266
He has this group, they're called...

218
00:26:28,485 --> 00:26:34,398
"Everyone Can" - they're special
needs kids. I've heard them play.

219
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:38,023
They're wicked!
The keyboardist is deaf.

220
00:26:38,235 --> 00:26:42,146
It's wild - how does he do it?

221
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:49,069
So I asked if they had an opening
for you, because I thought...

222
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:55,855
Okay, okay, okay, I'm sorry!

223
00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:00,236
Okay, take it easy. Easy!

224
00:27:03,153 --> 00:27:06,105
Okay, take it easy.

225
00:27:16,821 --> 00:27:19,985
Sebastian!

226
00:27:23,071 --> 00:27:26,318
Open up!

227
00:27:30,488 --> 00:27:33,984
Your dad and I
want to help, you know that.

228
00:27:34,197 --> 00:27:38,653
But you have to help us to help you.

229
00:27:38,864 --> 00:27:42,525
- What do you want?
- Is that so hard to understand?

230
00:27:42,739 --> 00:27:45,737
I don't want a fucking
personal assistant!

231
00:27:45,948 --> 00:27:49,988
Condescending jackasses
who push you around.

232
00:27:50,198 --> 00:27:54,855
Or worse, some fat old lady
to wipe my ass and comb my hair.

233
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:59,482
- Sebastian, that's enough.
- What do you want us to do?

234
00:27:59,698 --> 00:28:05,032
You have no idea how hard
we're working to help you!

235
00:28:06,282 --> 00:28:11,189
Not to mention the apartment
I'm paying for.

236
00:28:11,407 --> 00:28:18,020
- Which is empty and you won't let...
- It's always about money with you!

237
00:28:18,241 --> 00:28:24,523
It's not about money! I'd give
everything we own to make you well.

238
00:28:25,492 --> 00:28:30,066
But we're lost here.
What do you want from us?

239
00:28:30,284 --> 00:28:34,941
I want my fucking sight back!
My life back!

240
00:28:36,576 --> 00:28:40,072
Can you do that?

241
00:28:42,201 --> 00:28:46,526
No, you can't!
So there's not much you can do.

242
00:29:02,619 --> 00:29:04,823
- Hello.
- Hi, I'm Mia.

243
00:29:05,036 --> 00:29:07,903
- Come in.
- Thanks

244
00:29:22,703 --> 00:29:27,527
It was a nice walk from the station.
I think spring is finally here.

245
00:29:30,579 --> 00:29:34,489
Yes, it's nice.

246
00:29:35,746 --> 00:29:41,909
- Have you come a long way?
- No, I live in the Hornstull area.

247
00:29:42,121 --> 00:29:46,862
So, Mia, can you tell me
about yourself?

248
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:52,235
I'm 24, I live
in Hornstull, as I said...

249
00:29:52,455 --> 00:29:56,663
I work three or four evenings a week
in the home help services.

250
00:29:56,872 --> 00:29:59,195
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

251
00:29:59,414 --> 00:30:03,906
And on weekends I work
at Åhléns department store.

252
00:30:04,122 --> 00:30:10,486
Well, it's every other week, so I can
work the other weekends with...

253
00:30:10,706 --> 00:30:12,827
Sebastian.

254
00:30:13,623 --> 00:30:16,159
- Which department?
- Gloves and hosiery.

255
00:30:16,373 --> 00:30:21,445
I can get you a 25% discount
if you come while I'm working.

256
00:30:23,457 --> 00:30:28,992
Not that you look like you need
a discount on hosiery.

257
00:30:29,207 --> 00:30:33,948
- Do you have any formal training?
- No.

258
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:39,037
I don't know what I want to do yet,
so I'm just working and saving up.

259
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:42,532
Saving is good.
What the hell is this?

260
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:48,995
Have you invested
in stocks or bonds or what?

261
00:30:50,042 --> 00:30:51,832
A bank account.

262
00:30:52,042 --> 00:30:56,202
- I see. What's your interest rate?
- Göran!

263
00:30:56,417 --> 00:30:58,325
What?

264
00:30:58,542 --> 00:31:01,031
As I said on the phone,

265
00:31:01,251 --> 00:31:06,371
Sebastian lost his eyesight
in an accident three months ago,

266
00:31:06,585 --> 00:31:11,159
and it's taking time
for him to adapt.

267
00:31:11,376 --> 00:31:14,873
Since the accident
he's been very angry.

268
00:31:15,585 --> 00:31:21,369
We want to find someone who doesn't
irritate him as much as the others.

269
00:31:21,585 --> 00:31:23,623
Do you understand?

270
00:31:23,836 --> 00:31:28,125
I can't make any promises.

271
00:31:28,336 --> 00:31:32,460
I mean, I've never worked with blind
people before. Did I spit on you?

272
00:31:32,669 --> 00:31:36,746
Don't worry. Why don't you
go out and introduce yourself!

273
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:40,955
- Now?
- Yes. Take the cookies.

274
00:32:02,213 --> 00:32:06,669
What is it!? I said you don't
have to come here all the time.

275
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,874
Call my cell or just shout
from the kitchen. I'll hear you.

276
00:32:11,088 --> 00:32:15,793
Hi, I'm Mia. Your mom told me
to come and introduce myself.

277
00:32:16,005 --> 00:32:17,961
She did?

278
00:32:22,339 --> 00:32:25,124
She gave me some cookies.
Want some?

279
00:32:25,339 --> 00:32:29,796
No, I don't eat fast carbs.

280
00:32:53,841 --> 00:32:58,961
- You're not going to offer to help?
- Well, I assumed you'd ask.

281
00:33:01,466 --> 00:33:06,089
Cool, a Patek Aquanaut!
Oh, you have a Panerai too!

282
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:09,381
Two, actually. You like watches?

283
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:13,915
Yeah. My grandpa had
a watch store in the old town.

284
00:33:14,134 --> 00:33:18,791
He worked there till he died in April
'94. The same day as Kurt Cobain.

285
00:33:19,009 --> 00:33:25,752
Not that they had anything in common.
Except heroin addiction, of course.

286
00:33:26,468 --> 00:33:29,964
Grandpa used to say you can tell
a lot from a person's watch.

287
00:33:30,176 --> 00:33:32,167
He said that?

288
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:36,924
But he never wore one.
He didn't want to be judged that way.

289
00:33:37,594 --> 00:33:41,457
- Clearing out CDs?
- Looking for a song.

290
00:33:41,677 --> 00:33:45,885
- I don't remember the name or artist.
- That could take time.

291
00:33:46,636 --> 00:33:51,969
How about I read the names and make
"definitely not" and "maybe" piles?

292
00:33:52,178 --> 00:33:54,085
Then you just have to listen
to the maybes.

293
00:33:54,345 --> 00:33:56,170
- Okay

294
00:33:56,595 --> 00:33:58,881
So, what have you got?

295
00:33:59,095 --> 00:34:02,591
- Could it be Robbie Williams?
- No.

296
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,635
- Per Gessle?
- No, it's not Swedish.

297
00:34:06,845 --> 00:34:09,843
That makes things easier.

298
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:16,170
Engelbert Humperdinck?
You have eclectic taste.

299
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:19,386
No, it's not Engelbert.

300
00:34:19,596 --> 00:34:23,886
- Oh, Backstreet Boys?
- No, they...

301
00:34:24,096 --> 00:34:28,718
- I've got a Backstreet Boys CD?
- You sound worried!

302
00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:33,634
I'm just kidding, you don't.
Or maybe you do?

303
00:34:33,847 --> 00:34:37,675
No, not Backstreet Boys.

304
00:34:52,765 --> 00:34:56,012
- What are you sighing over?
- Pictures of America.

305
00:34:56,223 --> 00:34:58,463
- I'm saving for a road trip.
- Cool.

306
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:04,341
I'm going to fly to LA,
buy a car and start driving.

307
00:35:04,557 --> 00:35:10,755
When I get to New York I'll sell
the car and fly back to Sweden.

308
00:35:11,766 --> 00:35:15,890
- The Grand Canyon looks enormous.
- It is pretty big.

309
00:35:16,099 --> 00:35:18,422
- Have you been to America?
- Yeah.

310
00:35:18,641 --> 00:35:23,133
- When?
- A few times. New York with the guys.

311
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:28,470
Disneyland, Disneyworld. We went
to the Grand Canyon when I was 8-9.

312
00:35:28,684 --> 00:35:31,800
You had just turned 8.

313
00:35:32,017 --> 00:35:36,426
Sebastian screamed
for three straight hours.

314
00:35:36,642 --> 00:35:41,928
We were taking a donkey ride
and Sebastian wanted ice cream.

315
00:35:42,143 --> 00:35:48,175
We told him there was no ice cream
in the Grand Canyon, but he kept on.

316
00:35:48,393 --> 00:35:54,224
Finally the guide had us turn back,
saying the donkeys couldn't take it.

317
00:35:54,435 --> 00:35:56,840
"Donkey get nervous!"

318
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:02,595
Yeah, yeah, donkey get nervous.
Donkeys are very neurotic animals.

319
00:36:02,811 --> 00:36:05,513
- Aren't they?
- It's common knowledge...

320
00:36:05,727 --> 00:36:09,342
- Why don't you two go out?
- We are out.

321
00:36:09,561 --> 00:36:13,769
- Okay... See you later.
- Bye!

322
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:19,305
Is that bastard back?

323
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:23,727
- Get it off! Get it off!
- It's gone now, calm down.

324
00:36:23,937 --> 00:36:28,227
I fucking hate fucking wasps!

325
00:36:33,729 --> 00:36:38,636
The woman grabs
the man's buttock.

326
00:36:38,854 --> 00:36:42,895
- Want some popcorn?
- No thanks.

327
00:36:43,105 --> 00:36:45,854
He touches her left breast.

328
00:36:47,313 --> 00:36:50,513
And two more! And lateral!

329
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:56,353
- And five more!
- Stop that, I'm counting!

330
00:36:56,564 --> 00:37:00,225
That's great, keep going!

331
00:37:17,148 --> 00:37:20,100
I'll get it.

332
00:37:20,315 --> 00:37:24,772
Silverberg.
Hi, thanks for calling me back.

333
00:37:24,982 --> 00:37:28,016
It's about my son,
Sebastian Silverberg...

334
00:37:28,857 --> 00:37:33,562
- To the elevator?
- No, first left before the elevator.

335
00:37:35,774 --> 00:37:37,148
Welcome home.

336
00:37:38,525 --> 00:37:41,606
So I'm starting my new job
on Monday.

337
00:37:41,816 --> 00:37:45,561
Friday is my last day
in the store! Yes!

338
00:37:45,775 --> 00:37:50,479
The new catalogue is here
and the collection looks sweet.

339
00:37:50,692 --> 00:37:55,978
- Who's this? You have a brother?
- We miss you buddy. Call me ASAP.

340
00:37:57,817 --> 00:38:01,349
Hey, Sebbe, it's Oskar.
Me and Pelle

341
00:38:01,568 --> 00:38:05,811
just passed that Brazilian model
who tried to go down on you,

342
00:38:06,026 --> 00:38:11,775
in the toilet at East,
and we just had to call you.

343
00:38:11,985 --> 00:38:16,145
We miss you like hell. Call us!

344
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:21,729
...added you on facebook in January but
you haven't confirmed my request yet...

345
00:38:21,944 --> 00:38:27,692
- A bit 80s with an answering machine?
- Nice if you don't feel like talking.

346
00:38:27,903 --> 00:38:31,268
I bet.

347
00:38:31,486 --> 00:38:35,610
I guess it fits the American Psycho
look you're going for here.

348
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:38,818
- Were those your friends?
- Yeah.

349
00:38:39,028 --> 00:38:41,730
- Close friends?
- Sort of.

350
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:48,941
I found a CD with a hot picture
of you on the cover. Can I put it on?

351
00:38:49,154 --> 00:38:53,776
- If you must.
- I must!

352
00:39:14,114 --> 00:39:17,112
Oh my god! I'm blown away.

353
00:39:17,322 --> 00:39:22,359
Your voice is amazing! I don't know
what to say, you're gifted!

354
00:39:22,572 --> 00:39:26,566
The lyrics sucked,
but feel my goosebumps!

355
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:28,736
- The lyrics?
- Feel!

356
00:39:28,948 --> 00:39:33,854
- What about the lyrics?
- It's like a 90s boy band song.

357
00:39:34,073 --> 00:39:37,521
- Such a great voice!
- Thanks.

358
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:43,444
- Who wrote your songs?
- I did.

359
00:39:45,824 --> 00:39:50,114
Oh... Well, maybe
I didn't really get the lyrics.

360
00:39:50,324 --> 00:39:53,571
What's it about?

361
00:39:54,699 --> 00:39:58,030
Um, well, it's, you know...

362
00:39:58,241 --> 00:40:02,899
You're walking down the street,
you see a girl. She's hot.

363
00:40:03,117 --> 00:40:09,030
You think okay. You know.
She's dressed hot. You think okay...

364
00:40:09,992 --> 00:40:12,777
Sort of...

365
00:40:13,701 --> 00:40:17,741
You have to dare to put yourself
out there when you write.

366
00:40:17,951 --> 00:40:22,988
Let yourself be vulnerable.
Dare to show your feelings!

367
00:40:23,201 --> 00:40:26,982
Without feelings
the words are empty.

368
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:33,816
Write about heartbreak,
about rejection.

369
00:40:34,035 --> 00:40:37,863
It has to be personal, specific,

370
00:40:38,077 --> 00:40:43,446
from the heart, like Coldplay,
or David Gray.

371
00:40:43,661 --> 00:40:45,817
Or Paolo Nutini!

372
00:40:56,578 --> 00:41:01,912
- Cut that out!
- You have to feel...

373
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:07,489
...the magical pain of life!
- What romantic bullshit.

374
00:41:07,704 --> 00:41:10,572
Magical pain? Come on!

375
00:41:12,329 --> 00:41:16,370
What? You never had your heart
broken? Been rejected?

376
00:41:17,288 --> 00:41:19,741
Never been in love?

377
00:41:19,954 --> 00:41:22,822
- Ached for someone?
- No, not really.

378
00:41:23,038 --> 00:41:25,906
What have you been doing
all your life?

379
00:41:26,122 --> 00:41:29,238
I'll tell you some other time.
Can I ask you something?

380
00:41:29,455 --> 00:41:34,871
Are you a one-piece girl
or a bikini babe?

381
00:41:35,747 --> 00:41:40,784
- I sunbathe naked on private jetties.
- Oh yeah?

382
00:41:45,998 --> 00:41:48,996
You liar!

383
00:41:49,998 --> 00:41:53,695
NOW you dare all of a sudden!

384
00:41:55,457 --> 00:42:00,079
Here come two super-skinny chicks
with pouty lips.

385
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:03,039
One has a big-eared rat
on a string.

386
00:42:07,082 --> 00:42:12,154
Oh wow. Two very elegant businessmen
right behind you.

387
00:42:12,374 --> 00:42:15,989
- Not bad. But something is wrong.
- What?

388
00:42:16,208 --> 00:42:23,082
One of them walks funny. I bet
he's just had a sack and crack wax.

389
00:42:23,292 --> 00:42:28,163
Oh, he's itchy.
He may have lost some skin.

390
00:42:28,375 --> 00:42:32,416
- More, more!
- We have a cougar, could be Russian.

391
00:42:32,626 --> 00:42:38,539
With a real Playboy bunny body.
Oops, her heel is stuck in the grate.

392
00:42:39,876 --> 00:42:45,576
She's struggling, she's about to fall
- and someone comes to the rescue.

393
00:42:47,918 --> 00:42:52,042
You're crazy.
You're making this up!

394
00:42:52,252 --> 00:42:56,459
- No, I swear!
- Playboy bunny body...

395
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:03,876
- Do I have something in my teeth?
- No.

396
00:43:04,086 --> 00:43:06,705
When will you learn
to trust me?

397
00:43:07,586 --> 00:43:11,876
I won't let you go around with
food on your face or your fly open.

398
00:43:12,086 --> 00:43:18,415
- You might not notice.
- I notice most things.

399
00:43:20,962 --> 00:43:25,454
- You're so vain!
- I just don't want stuff in my teeth.

400
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:29,747
- Ice cream?
- Ice cream... That sounds good.

401
00:43:31,129 --> 00:43:33,285
The bench is here.

402
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:53,870
Hi! Excuse me, have I seen you
somewhere before?

403
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:58,830
- I don't think I've seen you before.
- Are you sure?

404
00:43:59,047 --> 00:44:01,750
- Yeah...
- But I'm sure...

405
00:44:01,964 --> 00:44:07,416
- Where do you hang out?
- Where don't I hang out?

406
00:44:07,631 --> 00:44:10,499
- Maybe it was at the terrace at F12?
- F12, maybe!

407
00:44:10,715 --> 00:44:16,084
- By the way, I'm Sebastian.
- Lisa. Nice to meet you.

408
00:44:16,298 --> 00:44:20,292
- What are you doing tonight?
- I'll probably go out.

409
00:44:20,507 --> 00:44:26,006
- Maybe we can meet up?
- Wow, pushy!

410
00:44:26,216 --> 00:44:31,549
Why don't you put your number
on my phone?

411
00:44:31,758 --> 00:44:35,621
Write: "Lisa with the pretty hair."

412
00:44:35,841 --> 00:44:41,127
- You have a lot of Lisas?
- There's Lisa with the ugly hair too.

413
00:44:47,134 --> 00:44:49,373
There. Your phone.

414
00:44:49,592 --> 00:44:53,171
Oh! I keep it in my back pocket.

415
00:44:53,384 --> 00:44:57,674
Actually the other one. Thanks.

416
00:44:57,884 --> 00:45:02,755
- See you.
- I'll be in touch.

417
00:45:06,635 --> 00:45:10,001
Here's your ice cream.

418
00:45:10,218 --> 00:45:12,707
Who was that?

419
00:45:12,927 --> 00:45:17,134
- You saw her? Was she hot?
- You don't know her?

420
00:45:18,344 --> 00:45:21,544
- What was she doing?
- Nothing. Was she hot?

421
00:45:21,761 --> 00:45:25,375
She was a typical...

422
00:45:26,844 --> 00:45:29,629
She was average height.

423
00:45:32,803 --> 00:45:37,259
Thin - not creepy thin,
but a fairly straight figure.

424
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:40,421
She had a friendly face,

425
00:45:40,637 --> 00:45:45,839
thick eyebrows, natural brown hair
and hazel eyes. What's so funny?

426
00:45:46,054 --> 00:45:50,842
You were so observant! Doesn't
sound like anything for me anyway.

427
00:45:51,054 --> 00:45:54,633
- Why not?
- Just doesn't sound like any fun.

428
00:45:58,929 --> 00:46:02,461
So, what do you look like then?

429
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:05,882
Looks are important to you,
aren't they?

430
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:13,468
They're important to everyone. Those
who deny it are either lying or ugly.

431
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:16,881
In which case they're not
in a position to be picky.

432
00:46:17,097 --> 00:46:22,217
- Come on, what do you look like?
- How do you think I look?

433
00:46:22,431 --> 00:46:26,507
In my head you're... fit,

434
00:46:26,723 --> 00:46:33,633
with fine features, perfect taste in
clothes... and I'm thinking blonde

435
00:46:33,848 --> 00:46:39,430
with blue eyes. Like a shorter
version of Cameron Diaz. Am I close?

436
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:46,260
- Pretty much...
- I'm so good at that!

437
00:46:46,474 --> 00:46:49,591
Here comes a wasp!

438
00:46:50,391 --> 00:46:53,508
What! Is it on me?
Take my ice cream! Take it!

439
00:46:54,558 --> 00:46:58,552
- I shouldn't have had any ice cream!
- It's gone now.

440
00:47:02,392 --> 00:47:07,926
- Do you like TV talent shows?
- Not a fan, why?

441
00:47:08,142 --> 00:47:13,677
There's a new one coming this fall
and I thought you should audition.

442
00:47:13,892 --> 00:47:17,637
- Forget it!
- Why not?

443
00:47:19,768 --> 00:47:23,216
Sebastian Silverberg,
the Blind Singer?

444
00:47:23,435 --> 00:47:27,298
It'd be like that armless guitarist
on YouTube. Forget it!

445
00:47:32,227 --> 00:47:38,259
- How are the road trip plans going?
- Fine. The saving is slow.

446
00:47:38,477 --> 00:47:41,890
You're so cheap,
it ought to go quickly.

447
00:47:42,102 --> 00:47:46,511
- I'll get there eventually.
- Of course you will.

448
00:47:55,770 --> 00:48:00,511
That's good! But how about
"All alone - where are you" instead?

449
00:48:00,728 --> 00:48:05,552
- That would work.
- Okay, then go into...

450
00:48:05,770 --> 00:48:12,017
The bridge, followed by
the new chorus.

451
00:48:12,229 --> 00:48:15,097
From the top.

452
00:48:37,314 --> 00:48:39,719
Good!

453
00:48:39,939 --> 00:48:44,727
- I ought to be getting home.
- What time is it?

454
00:48:44,939 --> 00:48:49,478
- 1:30.
- That's practically breakfast time.

455
00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:53,269
There's no point in going home
before breakfast.

456
00:48:53,482 --> 00:48:59,680
- And we have 15 verses to write.
- Okay, let's do that.

457
00:49:44,568 --> 00:49:51,727
Send in your audition demos to
our new talent show, Star Struck!

458
00:49:51,943 --> 00:49:54,562
Sebbe...

459
00:49:55,819 --> 00:50:01,318
I may have accidentally sent
your demo to the show...

460
00:50:01,527 --> 00:50:06,517
- Accidentally?
- Don't be mad - you're so good!

461
00:50:06,736 --> 00:50:10,018
Especially since I've been helping
with the lyrics!

462
00:50:10,236 --> 00:50:13,933
- I'm not doing it.
- Just see if you get an audition!

463
00:50:14,153 --> 00:50:17,934
I'm not going on one of those shows.

464
00:50:18,153 --> 00:50:24,980
- A bad attitude doesn't suit you.
- But everything else does!

465
00:50:26,404 --> 00:50:28,939
Stop it! That drives me crazy!

466
00:50:29,154 --> 00:50:33,444
What's that? I can't hear you
through a mouthful of chips.

467
00:52:18,911 --> 00:52:21,695
Sebastian!

468
00:52:26,453 --> 00:52:30,529
- It's your parents.
- Open up, throw us the key!

469
00:52:30,745 --> 00:52:35,651
- Call the police.
- Sebastian! Fantastic news!

470
00:52:35,870 --> 00:52:40,942
- What?
- They've decided to operate!

471
00:52:41,162 --> 00:52:44,907
- What?
- They want you there tomorrow!

472
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:48,735
- I'm going to have?
- Yes!

473
00:52:48,996 --> 00:52:52,196
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

474
00:52:55,579 --> 00:53:00,403
- I can't find my toothbrush.
- I'll try to find it.

475
00:53:23,831 --> 00:53:28,987
I thought you could
hold on to my watch.

476
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:35,204
- Can I put it in my bag?
- As long as you don't scratch it!

477
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:44,290
I need to tell you something...

478
00:53:44,499 --> 00:53:49,203
Hi there.
It's time for a little sedative.

479
00:53:49,416 --> 00:53:54,073
Ah, nice.
What did you want to say?

480
00:53:54,291 --> 00:53:57,871
Oh, nothing.

481
00:53:58,083 --> 00:54:01,366
- I should go now.
- Okay.

482
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:08,906
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

483
00:54:19,959 --> 00:54:22,792
Mia?

484
00:54:25,335 --> 00:54:30,039
- See you soon.
- See you.

485
00:55:17,004 --> 00:55:18,414
Mia?

486
00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:23,003
Sebastian! Mia had to go.
She'll be back tomorrow.

487
00:55:23,213 --> 00:55:28,333
- You look beautiful, Mom!
- Oh, darling!

488
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:35,788
- Everything's all right now.
- You look good, too, Dad!

489
00:55:36,006 --> 00:55:40,912
Hi, it's Mia
Hi, Sebbe!

490
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:47,544
Hi!

491
00:55:53,382 --> 00:55:55,787
Hi, Sebastian...

492
00:55:56,007 --> 00:55:59,704
It's me, Mia!

493
00:56:01,549 --> 00:56:05,756
Hi, Sebbe, it's me!

494
00:56:12,383 --> 00:56:16,791
Hi, Sebastian, it's me, Mia!

495
00:56:17,008 --> 00:56:19,710
"You're borderline", she says.

496
00:56:19,925 --> 00:56:24,713
I said, "Finish your course
before you start diagnosing people."

497
00:56:25,009 --> 00:56:29,252
It's impolite, just because
you're studying psychology.

498
00:56:31,509 --> 00:56:35,088
Hi...

499
00:56:35,301 --> 00:56:39,875
- I can come back later.
- No, no, come in!

500
00:56:52,135 --> 00:56:57,373
- So this is Mia?
- This is her.

501
00:56:57,594 --> 00:57:03,378
- I guess I don't look like...
- Don't worry about it.

502
00:57:04,261 --> 00:57:10,009
- Erik, Mia - Mia, Erik.
- I brought you some chocolates.

503
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:13,881
- Hey there.
- Hi, I'm Mia.

504
00:57:21,054 --> 00:57:25,261
- How are you? How do you feel?
- Well...

505
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:29,678
Everything's brighter
and more colorful.

506
00:57:29,887 --> 00:57:35,671
Dad looks fatter and Mom looks older.
Don't tell them I said that!

507
00:57:43,597 --> 00:57:48,717
I heard you get to go home on
Wednesday. What will you do first?

508
00:57:53,472 --> 00:57:59,303
I'm going to go back to my old life.
Like it was before the accident.

509
00:58:57,434 --> 00:58:59,639
- Hi!
- Hey! Great to see you!

510
00:59:07,602 --> 00:59:10,137
Cheers!

511
00:59:49,979 --> 00:59:53,760
Hi, Sebastian, it's Mia.
Sorry you couldn't meet me yesterday.

512
00:59:53,979 --> 00:59:58,518
I'm working all week, but maybe
we can go for a walk on Friday?

513
00:59:58,730 --> 01:00:02,593
- Everything all right?
- I'm fine.

514
01:00:29,315 --> 01:00:33,095
- How are the road trip plans going?
- Great. In fact...

515
01:00:33,315 --> 01:00:36,930
- I'm sorry. Can I take this?
- Sure.

516
01:00:37,149 --> 01:00:40,182
Hey! Lobster!

517
01:00:41,024 --> 01:00:46,393
Yeah, great. I was wondering if
it's okay if I bring three friends?

518
01:00:47,899 --> 01:00:49,689
Great!

519
01:00:49,899 --> 01:00:54,474
No, just put them under my name.
Okay, see you later. Bye.

520
01:00:54,691 --> 01:00:56,516
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

521
01:00:56,733 --> 01:01:01,307
- Sebbe! Hi!
- Hi! Jessica.

522
01:01:01,525 --> 01:01:04,772
- You remember Kristina?
- Of course.

523
01:01:06,067 --> 01:01:10,641
- Erik told us what happened.
- It must have been awful!

524
01:01:10,859 --> 01:01:15,563
Yeah, it was... difficult,
but I've moved on.

525
01:01:18,109 --> 01:01:24,356
Sorry, this is Mia, an old friend.
- This is Jessica and Kristina.

526
01:01:24,568 --> 01:01:27,187
- Are you going out tonight?
- Yeah.

527
01:01:27,402 --> 01:01:32,901
- Sweet, maybe we'll see you.
- I'm sure we will.

528
01:01:34,277 --> 01:01:38,485
- Nice girls.
- Yeah.

529
01:01:38,694 --> 01:01:44,442
- Want to get some ice cream?
- I don't really have time.

530
01:01:47,028 --> 01:01:51,650
- Have you written any music lately?
- No, I haven't felt like it.

531
01:01:52,403 --> 01:01:56,776
- Don't give up! You're so talented.
- I know.

532
01:02:00,029 --> 01:02:04,651
Is that really the kind of girls
you like hanging out with?

533
01:02:04,862 --> 01:02:08,986
- What's wrong with them?
- I just thought you'd be...

534
01:02:09,196 --> 01:02:13,770
That I'd be... what?

535
01:02:14,446 --> 01:02:18,274
Honestly, Mia,
you don't know me.

536
01:02:18,488 --> 01:02:23,987
You knew me when I was a different
person. I'm grateful for your help.

537
01:02:24,197 --> 01:02:29,648
- But you have no idea who I am now.
- How can you say that?

538
01:02:29,864 --> 01:02:33,644
Are you mad that
I don't look like that?

539
01:02:33,864 --> 01:02:37,728
- I don't care what you look like.
- Okay...

540
01:02:37,947 --> 01:02:44,276
- But it is weird that you lied.
- Well, I knew you liked Barbie dolls.

541
01:02:44,490 --> 01:02:50,024
- That says more about you than me.
- What do you mean by that?

542
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:56,522
You lied about your looks and you
liked me better when I was helpless.

543
01:02:56,740 --> 01:03:00,569
Now that I can see, you suddenly
have a problem with me.

544
01:03:00,782 --> 01:03:06,483
I just wonder what happened to you.
We laughed at stupid girls like that.

545
01:03:06,699 --> 01:03:09,650
No, I laughed at you
laughing at "stupid girls like that".

546
01:03:09,866 --> 01:03:14,323
- You're obsessed with them. Drop it.
- You drop it! What's your problem?!

547
01:03:14,533 --> 01:03:21,146
When will you dare to take a chance?
Go for your dream - you're so close!

548
01:03:21,367 --> 01:03:26,404
Get a life! Find a handicapped
boyfriend if it turns you on.

549
01:03:26,617 --> 01:03:28,608
- Seriously?
- Yes, seriously.

550
01:03:29,492 --> 01:03:34,446
I just want you to succeed because
you're so good. Because I care.

551
01:03:34,659 --> 01:03:38,107
- Thanks. That's great.
- What do you mean "great"?

552
01:03:39,576 --> 01:03:43,617
- You'd rather be with one of those...
- Go on, what?

553
01:03:43,826 --> 01:03:49,160
- You know what I mean!
- Yes, I would. Totally.

554
01:03:49,368 --> 01:03:52,734
- You're a blind idiot!
- Nope, I'm not blind.

555
01:03:52,952 --> 01:03:55,619
- Then open your eyes!
- Have a nice life.

556
01:03:55,827 --> 01:03:58,067
You too!

557
01:04:16,662 --> 01:04:21,450
- It's all I have.
- You have Maria and the kids.

558
01:04:21,662 --> 01:04:26,864
This is the only hobby I have.
I don't have anything else.

559
01:04:39,288 --> 01:04:42,121
Hi, are you looking
for anything special?

560
01:07:05,713 --> 01:07:10,122
'Hi awake? '

561
01:07:19,631 --> 01:07:22,499
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

562
01:07:25,423 --> 01:07:30,127
You know what? This isn't
a very nice way to treat people.

563
01:07:31,007 --> 01:07:35,878
- It's fucking immature.
- I'm going to my grandma's funeral!

564
01:07:36,090 --> 01:07:40,036
Yeah, yeah.
Your grandma dies often, doesn't she?

565
01:07:40,257 --> 01:07:45,247
You don't even remember
sleeping with me before. Incredible.

566
01:07:45,466 --> 01:07:48,630
Bye. Say hello to grandma!

567
01:07:50,841 --> 01:07:55,546
I thought she'd take a hint,
but she calls me crying,

568
01:07:55,758 --> 01:08:01,672
says she broke up with her boyfriend
for me, and I was like, why?

569
01:08:01,884 --> 01:08:06,209
Women. Why are they so emotional?
So much drama!

570
01:08:08,259 --> 01:08:11,257
- Sebbe?
- Huh?

571
01:08:11,467 --> 01:08:16,291
- Don't you get tired of this shit?
- What shit?

572
01:08:16,509 --> 01:08:20,124
I can't be bothered.
I'm going home.

573
01:08:20,343 --> 01:08:23,874
- Who's going home?
- Sebbe, apparently.

574
01:08:24,093 --> 01:08:31,334
- Come on, Sebbe! You've changed.
- Cool it. Don't be so emotional.

575
01:08:31,552 --> 01:08:35,498
- So much drama!
- Yeah, yeah.

576
01:08:35,719 --> 01:08:40,044
- Take care.
- Sebbe! Don't be so boring!

577
01:08:40,261 --> 01:08:44,420
- Buy your own drinks, Oskar!
- You suck!

578
01:08:44,636 --> 01:08:47,587
Loser!

579
01:08:48,095 --> 01:08:50,844
Sebbe?

580
01:08:54,470 --> 01:08:58,760
Oh! Excuse me?

581
01:09:01,595 --> 01:09:06,585
- Do you ever see Mia?
- No, not for a while.

582
01:09:06,804 --> 01:09:11,426
Such a nice girl.
Pretty and sweet and ambitious.

583
01:09:11,638 --> 01:09:17,256
- You're not in touch at all?
- We don't hang in the same circles.

584
01:09:17,471 --> 01:09:21,300
But you two seemed so close.

585
01:09:21,513 --> 01:09:25,554
We didn't have much choice.

586
01:09:26,764 --> 01:09:32,428
She was here yesterday with a letter
for you. In the drawer.

587
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:57,760
- Is this it? Nothing else?
- No, that's all.

588
01:11:37,730 --> 01:11:39,602
Thanks.

589
01:11:41,938 --> 01:11:48,813
Can you tell us something about
yourself that's not on the form?

590
01:11:50,189 --> 01:11:51,468
Like what?

591
01:11:52,772 --> 01:11:57,264
Something that makes you
different, or special?

592
01:11:59,939 --> 01:12:04,182
Let's try an easier question. When
did you decide to become an artist?

593
01:12:13,232 --> 01:12:18,813
I remember it was on my brother
Theo's eighth birthday.

594
01:12:19,024 --> 01:12:22,437
When all the kids had gone home,

595
01:12:22,649 --> 01:12:26,809
Theo and I went upstairs
to play with his presents.

596
01:12:27,024 --> 01:12:31,646
He'd gotten a Millennium Falcon
space ship,

597
01:12:31,858 --> 01:12:37,357
plus all the Star Wars action
figures, and I was super jealous.

598
01:12:37,567 --> 01:12:41,063
We were playing and MTV was on.

599
01:12:41,275 --> 01:12:48,102
And it was Tracy Chapman
with the live version of Fast Car.

600
01:12:48,317 --> 01:12:53,473
And I remember
we both just stopped playing,

601
01:12:53,693 --> 01:12:57,141
all at once, and looked at the TV.

602
01:12:59,276 --> 01:13:05,060
I saw how fascinated he was.
I was only six,

603
01:13:05,277 --> 01:13:11,144
but I thought to myself, "This is
what I'm going to do with my life."

604
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:15,982
I begged Mom to buy me a guitar,
and she did.

605
01:13:18,194 --> 01:13:22,058
Then... Theo got sick that summer.

606
01:13:22,278 --> 01:13:25,229
He died six months later.

607
01:13:25,444 --> 01:13:29,936
So he never got to see...

608
01:13:30,695 --> 01:13:32,769
...that I kept practicing.

609
01:13:33,903 --> 01:13:39,521
Apart from Theo, music
is the only thing I've ever loved.

610
01:13:50,113 --> 01:13:53,395
- You have one new message.
- Hi, Mia, it's Sebastian!

611
01:13:54,071 --> 01:13:56,690
I guess you're working.

612
01:13:56,905 --> 01:14:02,190
I just wanted to say I auditioned
for Star Struck today and I made it.

613
01:14:02,405 --> 01:14:05,486
I'll be on TV on Saturday, live.

614
01:14:06,364 --> 01:14:11,151
So I just want to thank you for
sending in my demo and everything.

615
01:14:11,364 --> 01:14:14,777
Oh, I have another call.

616
01:14:14,989 --> 01:14:20,903
I miss... Take care,
and thanks a million again. Bye.

617
01:14:23,156 --> 01:14:24,815
Hi, Mom!

618
01:14:25,031 --> 01:14:29,736
No, not much.
I'm going to be on TV on Saturday.

619
01:14:29,990 --> 01:14:35,192
It's almost time for the show
you've been waiting for all summer.

620
01:14:35,407 --> 01:14:38,938
Sweden's biggest talent show...

621
01:14:44,866 --> 01:14:48,730
It's extremely important
that you're on time.

622
01:14:53,491 --> 01:14:56,324
- Nervous?
- Nah...

623
01:14:56,533 --> 01:15:00,527
I'm sure it's going to go great!

624
01:15:16,993 --> 01:15:21,366
Screaming psychos, alcoholic mothers,
cut-up junkies...

625
01:15:21,576 --> 01:15:24,528
All of them come before me!

626
01:15:25,660 --> 01:15:30,364
Our next talent is
a guitarist and singer.

627
01:15:30,577 --> 01:15:33,244
All the way from Östermalm...

628
01:15:33,452 --> 01:15:40,327
- Are you married?
- No, but I'm banging your wife.

629
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:42,278
She's unclean!

630
01:15:42,494 --> 01:15:47,614
...that you'll want to hang with.
A big hand for Sebastian Silverberg!

631
01:15:50,787 --> 01:15:54,532
- Quiet, quiet, Sebastian's on!
- Come on, son!

632
01:17:01,249 --> 01:17:05,574
That was Sebastian's twist
on Robyn's Hang with Me.

633
01:17:05,791 --> 01:17:09,867
- Over to you, Josefin.
- What can I say? You were awesome!

634
01:17:10,083 --> 01:17:11,990
Thanks.

635
01:17:12,208 --> 01:17:15,491
- Lars?
- Powerful. Very good!

636
01:17:15,708 --> 01:17:20,117
I just hope people vote for your
voice, not your good looks!

637
01:17:20,542 --> 01:17:24,073
- He was wonderful!
- Wasn't he!

638
01:17:24,292 --> 01:17:28,866
To vote for Sebastian Silverberg,
dial 08-205080.

639
01:17:29,084 --> 01:17:32,035
- Did you call from both phones?
- Yes, I have both!

640
01:17:32,751 --> 01:17:34,457
Every vote counts!

641
01:17:35,251 --> 01:17:40,750
The next act is from Piteå: Marie
Stråhle and her dogs Mini and Bobo!

642
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:50,534
Dancing dogs may have been
entertaining before TV and X-boxes...

643
01:17:50,752 --> 01:17:54,118
- Watch it!
- Look where you're going!

644
01:17:55,544 --> 01:17:59,834
No freak show act will win.
Forget them.

645
01:18:00,044 --> 01:18:03,789
- So the acrobat girls?
- They're out.

646
01:18:04,003 --> 01:18:07,084
- But their acrobatic skills could...
- They're at least 40!

647
01:18:07,295 --> 01:18:11,205
- Sebbe! We voted for you!
- We want you to win!

648
01:18:11,420 --> 01:18:15,165
- Can we have your autograph?
- What are your names?

649
01:18:16,337 --> 01:18:19,537
Whoa... Johanna, Elin, Irma?

650
01:18:19,754 --> 01:18:21,828
Stand straight!

651
01:18:29,338 --> 01:18:31,412
Thank you, dear.

652
01:18:31,629 --> 01:18:36,168
- So that's your friend?
- More an acquaintance.

653
01:18:38,922 --> 01:18:44,373
He must be the most handsome man
I've ever seen!

654
01:18:44,589 --> 01:18:48,168
Unfortunately, he thinks so too.

655
01:18:59,048 --> 01:19:02,579
- I say no.
- That's a no.

656
01:19:02,798 --> 01:19:07,953
- That was embarrassing.
- And I'd like to say no.

657
01:19:23,174 --> 01:19:27,003
I hope you vote for this group!
That was great!

658
01:19:27,216 --> 01:19:32,004
- Sure, I can sing at your place.
- Oh, please do!

659
01:20:02,343 --> 01:20:06,005
I have a flight to LA
via London on the 19th.

660
01:20:06,218 --> 01:20:11,090
- It leaves at 6: 15 AM, is that OK?
- I'll check.

661
01:20:19,386 --> 01:20:22,882
- Is it okay?
- Oh, I just...

662
01:20:28,595 --> 01:20:34,176
I... no... You know what,
I don't think I'm ready to book yet.

663
01:20:37,387 --> 01:20:41,760
- What do you think?
- I think you should go!

664
01:20:41,971 --> 01:20:45,004
Yes, you're right. Book it!

665
01:20:48,554 --> 01:20:52,050
One, two, three, four
and one, two, three.

666
01:20:52,263 --> 01:20:57,216
- Together, and "Baby" and...
- I'm sorry... this doesn't feel...

667
01:20:57,430 --> 01:21:00,760
The steps, "Baby"...
I can't even see the camera!

668
01:21:00,972 --> 01:21:06,092
It's okay, honey, that's why we
rehearse with the cameraman.

669
01:21:06,305 --> 01:21:12,136
You do your thing and let him work on
staying out of the way. From the top!

670
01:21:16,848 --> 01:21:21,055
With his unique version of
the Marina and the Diamonds song,

671
01:21:21,265 --> 01:21:24,879
Sebastian Silverberg
with I Am Not a Robot!

672
01:21:27,057 --> 01:21:30,173
Those are his parents!
They're so sweet!

673
01:21:31,432 --> 01:21:34,880
Tell me when you see his friends.

674
01:21:40,099 --> 01:21:44,922
- Has he stopped calling?
- No, he's called a few times.

675
01:21:45,141 --> 01:21:49,715
- What did he say?
- I haven't answered.

676
01:21:49,933 --> 01:21:51,307
Quiet!

677
01:22:29,477 --> 01:22:35,261
- He's a partier - is he hung over?
- No, that's not it.

678
01:23:04,312 --> 01:23:06,517
Keep it going!

679
01:23:28,356 --> 01:23:30,642
My god...

680
01:23:30,856 --> 01:23:33,770
Good work!

681
01:23:33,981 --> 01:23:38,437
As usual, we start with the judges.
Lars, over to you!

682
01:23:39,981 --> 01:23:43,596
- Are you still in the running?
- Just barely.

683
01:23:43,815 --> 01:23:48,188
- Tell me when you see my hand.
- Now.

684
01:23:49,607 --> 01:23:54,644
- I'll call the doctor. We'll go...
- I've already seen him.

685
01:23:56,357 --> 01:23:58,597
They're doing all they can.

686
01:24:15,525 --> 01:24:18,938
- Sebastian!
- Sebastian, can I get a picture?

687
01:24:19,150 --> 01:24:24,021
What happened last week, Sebastian?
Do you feel ready for tomorrow?

688
01:25:15,279 --> 01:25:18,146
That was fine.

689
01:25:21,529 --> 01:25:25,736
- How is Sebastian's vision?
- He says it comes and goes.

690
01:25:26,779 --> 01:25:30,062
- Will he tell the truth?
- I don't know.

691
01:25:30,279 --> 01:25:34,854
He doesn't want it
to come out until after the final.

692
01:25:35,071 --> 01:25:39,112
He's afraid it will
affect the voting.

693
01:25:40,822 --> 01:25:44,686
- How are you?
- I'm okay. It's harder for Göran.

694
01:25:44,905 --> 01:25:48,318
It's hard to see
his son hurting, after...

695
01:25:48,531 --> 01:25:53,946
- Sebastian told me about Theo.
- He did?

696
01:25:54,156 --> 01:26:00,568
He hardly ever talks about him. It's
great that he's begun to open up.

697
01:26:03,823 --> 01:26:07,734
You've done wonders for him!

698
01:26:13,824 --> 01:26:16,312
Shit!

699
01:26:16,532 --> 01:26:20,573
Accept it, you're useless.
You'll never beat my high score.

700
01:26:21,908 --> 01:26:26,233
That was a great melody.
Nice lyrics.

701
01:26:26,449 --> 01:26:30,739
- Is it about anyone special?
- You, of course! Gimme that.

702
01:26:30,950 --> 01:26:36,615
- Can you see well enough to play?
- Well enough to beat you!

703
01:26:36,825 --> 01:26:40,771
Hi, it's Sebastian.
Leave a message after the sound.

704
01:26:42,825 --> 01:26:46,606
Hello, this is Walter Bergman
from the evening news.

705
01:26:46,826 --> 01:26:52,242
We've learned that you're losing
your sight after a brain hemorrhage.

706
01:26:52,451 --> 01:26:57,986
The story will be on the front page.
Call me if you have any comments.

707
01:26:58,201 --> 01:27:02,491
My number is 08...

708
01:27:05,285 --> 01:27:09,742
Hi Sebastian, this is Stina
from Gossip magazine. Would you...

709
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:54,864
Hello.

710
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:59,453
- Hello, hi... how are you?
- Fine.

711
01:28:01,872 --> 01:28:06,446
- I didn't expect you to answer.
- I know...

712
01:28:06,664 --> 01:28:11,819
Look, I know I owe you a massive
apology for the last time we met.

713
01:28:12,039 --> 01:28:15,784
I acted like a total ass.
I'm really, really sorry.

714
01:28:21,206 --> 01:28:25,532
- Hmm, so how are you?
- Pretty good. I...

715
01:28:27,457 --> 01:28:29,531
I'm okay.

716
01:28:29,749 --> 01:28:33,280
Can you believe the record label
wants me back!

717
01:28:33,499 --> 01:28:38,868
- Really? Will you sign with them?
- Nah.

718
01:28:40,124 --> 01:28:45,280
I think I'll wait for an indie label
that lets me write my own stuff.

719
01:28:49,875 --> 01:28:53,287
Aren't you going to sing any
of your own songs on the show?

720
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:59,579
I could, but I don't know.
Time has just flown by and...

721
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:07,247
- Not everyone is as brave as you.
- Brave? I don't know about that.

722
01:29:11,168 --> 01:29:15,742
- Do you want to come tonight?
- To the final?

723
01:29:19,210 --> 01:29:23,618
- Well, I'm leaving in the morning...
- Yeah? Wow!

724
01:29:23,835 --> 01:29:29,286
- To America?
...and I'm still packing, so...

725
01:29:30,335 --> 01:29:35,621
I can ask them to reserve a seat
for you in case you change your mind.

726
01:29:35,836 --> 01:29:38,704
Okay...

727
01:29:40,878 --> 01:29:43,497
I'll let you go now.

728
01:29:43,711 --> 01:29:47,835
I hope your road trip is awesome.

729
01:29:48,045 --> 01:29:52,453
- That it's everything you hoped.
- Thanks.

730
01:29:52,670 --> 01:29:56,202
- Well, bon voyage.
- Bye.

731
01:30:05,963 --> 01:30:09,375
"Bon voyage"?

732
01:30:34,298 --> 01:30:38,920
After ten exciting weeks
following ten unique talents,

733
01:30:39,131 --> 01:30:45,330
hand-picked from thousands of
applicants, it's time for the final.

734
01:30:56,049 --> 01:30:59,497
- 30 minutes, Sebastian.
- Sure...

735
01:30:59,716 --> 01:31:04,172
- Do you need anything?
- No, I'm fine.

736
01:31:04,383 --> 01:31:10,083
Wait - there is something
I could use some help with.

737
01:31:31,009 --> 01:31:36,343
I will! Maybe not right when I land,
but after a few days.

738
01:31:38,093 --> 01:31:41,921
Hi, Mom. Yeah, he told me.

739
01:31:45,927 --> 01:31:49,707
Can I call you back?
- What are you doing here?

740
01:31:49,927 --> 01:31:55,545
I had to see you. I didn't want you
to leave without a proper goodbye.

741
01:31:55,761 --> 01:31:58,759
Well... Bye then.

742
01:31:58,969 --> 01:32:04,385
I have to finish packing.
So I can go "get a life", right?

743
01:32:05,553 --> 01:32:08,338
- And you need to get back!
- But...

744
01:32:08,553 --> 01:32:15,759
I'm so sorry for how I treated you.
Seeing you after the operation...

745
01:32:15,970 --> 01:32:19,550
...reminded me of the accident
and how terrible I felt then.

746
01:32:20,762 --> 01:32:26,214
I mean... when I got to know you
in all that time we spent together,

747
01:32:26,429 --> 01:32:29,925
You made me feel things...

748
01:32:30,138 --> 01:32:33,053
You know, things
I'd never felt before.

749
01:32:33,263 --> 01:32:38,419
Like... before I met you,
I felt like a Swatch on the inside,

750
01:32:38,638 --> 01:32:41,885
but like a Patek Philippe
on the outside.

751
01:32:42,097 --> 01:32:45,379
- You're talking about watches now?
- I mean...

752
01:32:45,597 --> 01:32:51,760
My lyrics! You know how they were,
but you made me feel the opposite.

753
01:32:51,973 --> 01:32:55,836
More like Coldplay
than Lady Gaga, you know?

754
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:03,513
You made me feel...
You make me feel like...

755
01:33:09,432 --> 01:33:10,711
Instead of:

756
01:33:17,807 --> 01:33:21,636
That's what I wanted to say.
And also... I'm sorry.

757
01:33:27,683 --> 01:33:30,302
I'm sorry.

758
01:33:34,017 --> 01:33:38,141
- Come on, let's go to the final.
- Screw the final.

759
01:33:38,892 --> 01:33:42,305
Hello and welcome
to the grand final!

760
01:33:42,976 --> 01:33:48,475
A big hand for the hip hop
dance group Rhythmic Soul Crew.

761
01:34:22,103 --> 01:34:24,971
- Shit...
- Where the hell have you been?!

762
01:34:25,186 --> 01:34:29,132
Take a seat in the front there.

763
01:34:29,937 --> 01:34:32,769
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

764
01:34:32,979 --> 01:34:37,932
- God, I'm still in my pajamas!
- You're so embarrassing!

765
01:34:38,937 --> 01:34:40,216
Go!

766
01:34:57,230 --> 01:35:02,765
Let's hear it for the gravity-defying
dancers of Rhythmic Soul Crew!

767
01:35:04,355 --> 01:35:10,637
It's time to introduce the man
who's made big headlines this week.

768
01:35:10,856 --> 01:35:14,352
Let's give a big hand
for Sebastian Silverberg!

769
01:35:33,065 --> 01:35:34,807
- Hi, Sebastian.
- Hi.

770
01:35:35,024 --> 01:35:38,472
I love you, Sebbe!

771
01:35:38,691 --> 01:35:44,558
- How are you?
- I have major butterflies right now!

772
01:35:44,774 --> 01:35:50,889
I'll bet. Before you perform,
I thought I'd give you the chance

773
01:35:51,108 --> 01:35:56,015
to comment on all the rumors
circulating the past few weeks.

774
01:35:56,234 --> 01:35:58,900
Okay, uh...

775
01:36:01,651 --> 01:36:05,265
It's true, I'm losing my sight.

776
01:36:08,276 --> 01:36:14,558
My journey hasn't been all that easy
this past year.

777
01:36:14,776 --> 01:36:20,228
But I guess, even if...
even if you face tough times,

778
01:36:20,443 --> 01:36:25,148
you just have to take a chance
and try your best.

779
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:32,235
That's what helps you write
interesting lyrics, right?

780
01:36:38,528 --> 01:36:40,565
It gives me great pleasure
to present,

781
01:36:40,778 --> 01:36:46,443
for the first time with one of his
own songs, Sebastian Silverberg!

782
01:36:58,654 --> 01:37:05,860
I'd like to dedicate this song to
those who are starting new journeys.

783
01:37:06,071 --> 01:37:10,693
And tonight I can see.
Tonight I can see everything.
