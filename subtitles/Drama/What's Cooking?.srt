1
00:00:40,001 --> 00:00:47,126
WHAT'S COOKING IN PARIS

2
00:01:57,043 --> 00:01:59,210
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening, madam.

3
00:02:20,918 --> 00:02:21,918
All is well?

4
00:02:22,085 --> 00:02:24,210
- Very well, thank you.
- Very well.

5
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,085
What a good idea, coming here.

6
00:02:27,251 --> 00:02:30,543
- It's not at all expensive.
- How much?

7
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,835
- 20,000 a head.
- Without wine?

8
00:02:33,001 --> 00:02:35,668
- Of course.
- A gift.

9
00:02:37,585 --> 00:02:40,876
If they ask for a liqueur,
it's on the house.

10
00:02:41,043 --> 00:02:43,543
- And if they don't?
- Nothing.

11
00:02:55,001 --> 00:02:58,335
- What's that?
- Eggs mimosa, Mr Septime.

12
00:02:58,501 --> 00:03:01,210
- You call that eggs mimosa?
- Yes.

13
00:03:01,376 --> 00:03:05,751
To simulate eggs mimosa foliage,
I want tarragon!

14
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:08,418
Come on.

15
00:03:15,335 --> 00:03:16,835
Be careful.

16
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,543
- Who did that?
- He did.

17
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,210
Him?

18
00:03:24,126 --> 00:03:26,168
- You did this?
- So what?

19
00:03:26,335 --> 00:03:27,960
Watch your tone.

20
00:03:28,126 --> 00:03:31,376
I've already said that
to simulate eggs mimosa foliage,

21
00:03:31,543 --> 00:03:33,626
I want tarragon,
not parsley.

22
00:03:33,793 --> 00:03:36,335
- Tell the chef.
- I don't care about the chef.

23
00:03:36,501 --> 00:03:38,210
What's the matter?

24
00:03:38,376 --> 00:03:40,460
- OK, Marcel?
- What's up?

25
00:03:40,626 --> 00:03:41,793
A trifle.

26
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,376
Mr Septime wants to use tarragon.

27
00:03:44,543 --> 00:03:46,876
In the mimosa?
Parsley and onions.

28
00:03:47,043 --> 00:03:48,960
No tarragon.
That's not good.

29
00:03:49,126 --> 00:03:51,335
- That's what I said.
- No.

30
00:03:51,501 --> 00:03:53,835
You're not happy with my godson?

31
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:55,876
Oh, he's your godson?

32
00:03:56,043 --> 00:03:58,960
- Louise's boy.
- Oh! He looks just like her.

33
00:03:59,126 --> 00:04:00,710
- Is Louise well?
- Very well.

34
00:04:00,876 --> 00:04:03,251
- And you, Marcel?
- Very, very well.

35
00:04:03,418 --> 00:04:06,751
Too many cooks in this kitchen,
don't you think?

36
00:04:08,293 --> 00:04:09,960
I have to be going.

37
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,293
Only he can give me a complex.

38
00:04:16,001 --> 00:04:19,168
Shame!
Aren't you ashamed?

39
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,793
Coward!

40
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,501
No. That's quite enough.

41
00:04:22,668 --> 00:04:24,710
What can you do!

42
00:04:33,126 --> 00:04:35,543
- Tie.
- Oh, sorry.

43
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:38,501
My Lady called?

44
00:04:38,668 --> 00:04:40,626
No. I was calling Poupette.

45
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:47,293
You're not called Poupette!

46
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,126
Are you called Poupette?
Disappear.

47
00:04:50,293 --> 00:04:51,210
Sorry.

48
00:04:51,376 --> 00:04:54,543
- Very good, Septime.
- Thank you, my Lord. The bag.

49
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,335
After you.

50
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:01,376
- Where is he?
- Here, Mr Septime.

51
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,085
Cloakroom.

52
00:05:05,251 --> 00:05:07,626
It was very good.
We'll be back.

53
00:05:07,793 --> 00:05:09,293
I'll see you out.

54
00:05:22,043 --> 00:05:23,835
What's that?

55
00:05:24,001 --> 00:05:25,751
Thursday, my Lord.

56
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:28,626
President Novales off to the Elysée.

57
00:05:28,793 --> 00:05:31,210
More traffic jams.

58
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:40,543
When you've dropped me
at the Elysée,

59
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:43,501
book me a table for dinner
at Septime's.

60
00:05:43,668 --> 00:05:45,085
But, your Excellency...

61
00:05:45,251 --> 00:05:47,543
I said at Septime's.

62
00:05:58,335 --> 00:05:59,835
Mr Septime...

63
00:06:01,376 --> 00:06:03,585
- Sorry?
- Look.

64
00:06:04,251 --> 00:06:05,335
Where?

65
00:06:06,793 --> 00:06:08,335
Over there.

66
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:19,501
- Wait...
- There. Write.

67
00:06:19,668 --> 00:06:21,835
- Oh, no?
- Yes.

68
00:06:25,793 --> 00:06:27,126
Thank you, Roger.

69
00:06:27,293 --> 00:06:28,501
A little cachou?

70
00:06:28,668 --> 00:06:31,376
No, thank you, Roger.
How kind.

71
00:06:41,585 --> 00:06:43,376
Please!

72
00:06:43,543 --> 00:06:44,835
Monsieur?

73
00:06:45,001 --> 00:06:46,585
What's wrong?

74
00:06:46,751 --> 00:06:48,626
I've stained my tie.

75
00:06:48,793 --> 00:06:51,543
No. Don't touch. Wait.

76
00:06:55,168 --> 00:06:57,085
Don't move.
Hands like this.

77
00:07:06,835 --> 00:07:08,835
No. There. It's there.

78
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,751
Oh, Minister!

79
00:07:12,918 --> 00:07:14,710
Minister?

80
00:07:14,876 --> 00:07:17,168
The secretary of state.

81
00:07:17,335 --> 00:07:19,126
The undersecretary of state.

82
00:07:19,293 --> 00:07:21,293
The...?

83
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,376
No matter.

84
00:07:22,585 --> 00:07:25,918
My dear Septime,
here's one you haven't heard.

85
00:07:26,085 --> 00:07:28,335
You're going to make me laugh again.

86
00:07:28,501 --> 00:07:31,210
One day, my principal
private secretary...

87
00:07:31,376 --> 00:07:32,418
He's a scream!

88
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:34,501
Come now, wait!

89
00:07:34,668 --> 00:07:38,251
My principal private secretary
asks me to bring him...

90
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:51,668
It was his sister!

91
00:07:53,793 --> 00:07:57,376
Very sharp. Very witty.
He's a charming chap.

92
00:07:58,085 --> 00:08:00,168
- My friend!
- Commissioner.

93
00:08:00,335 --> 00:08:02,960
Two colleagues from abroad.

94
00:08:03,126 --> 00:08:06,460
- Commendatore Riganti.
- How do you do?

95
00:08:06,668 --> 00:08:09,126
And his German colleague,
Dr Muller.

96
00:08:09,293 --> 00:08:10,918
Pleased to meet you.

97
00:08:11,085 --> 00:08:16,251
I promised him you'd give him
the recipe for your souffle.

98
00:08:16,418 --> 00:08:17,751
Please.

99
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,960
- It's a professional secret.
- Just between us...

100
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:25,293
For you, Commissioner...

101
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:28,460
Right. You take
one kilo of potatoes.

102
00:08:28,543 --> 00:08:30,126
For how many people?

103
00:08:30,335 --> 00:08:37,501
It depends whether they're normal
or abnormal, a fat person.

104
00:08:37,668 --> 00:08:40,501
One kilo of potatoes,

105
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:43,793
one litre of milk, three eggs,

106
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:48,960
90 grams of butter,
salt and nutmeg.

107
00:08:49,126 --> 00:08:50,126
Nutmeg.

108
00:08:50,751 --> 00:08:53,293
I repeat, Herr Muller.

109
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:19,460
Signor Riganti, Commissioner...

110
00:09:19,751 --> 00:09:22,376
Understood, Herr Muller?

111
00:09:25,126 --> 00:09:27,835
Goodbye, Herr Muller.

112
00:09:29,501 --> 00:09:32,501
- Your coat.
- You're leaving during lunch?

113
00:09:32,668 --> 00:09:35,210
Yes. I have to go to...

114
00:09:35,376 --> 00:09:38,668
You're a dark horse.
I'll have to look into that.

115
00:09:38,835 --> 00:09:43,043
Oh, no. I'm going to see
my poor old mother.

116
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:46,085
- She's 90 and this tall.
- She won't grow now.

117
00:09:47,043 --> 00:09:48,001
See you soon.

118
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,793
Gentlemen, here's the souffle.

119
00:09:53,168 --> 00:09:54,585
Monsieur.

120
00:09:55,918 --> 00:09:57,418
Wait...

121
00:09:57,585 --> 00:10:00,793
Look! Did you see that?
Look up there.

122
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,210
Up where?

123
00:10:39,168 --> 00:10:41,251
That's rather exaggerated.

124
00:10:41,418 --> 00:10:43,418
They'll think that's weird.

125
00:10:44,251 --> 00:10:47,001
I'm curious to know
what they think of me

126
00:10:47,168 --> 00:10:50,585
and how they treat customers
when I'm not there.

127
00:10:50,668 --> 00:10:53,501
Well, my lads...

128
00:10:53,585 --> 00:10:57,251
I think I've had an idea.

129
00:11:04,085 --> 00:11:05,876
Good day, sir.

130
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:11,835
- Isn't the boss here?
- No. Mr Septime has gone out.

131
00:11:12,001 --> 00:11:16,126
- You must be pleased.
- Why should I be pleased?

132
00:11:16,293 --> 00:11:19,668
- Is it too late for lunch?
- Not at all.

133
00:11:19,835 --> 00:11:23,001
Monsieur shall have
what Monsieur wishes.

134
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:28,543
- See to Monsieur.
- Good day, monsieur. This way.

135
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,127
My God!

136
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:40,751
- Isn't the boss here?
- Mr Septime has gone out.

137
00:11:40,918 --> 00:11:42,960
You must be pleased.

138
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:46,501
- You must be pleased.
- My word!

139
00:11:46,668 --> 00:11:48,876
- Are you happy, then?
- Yes.

140
00:11:52,335 --> 00:11:54,835
- Sorry.
- It's nothing, monsieur.

141
00:11:55,793 --> 00:11:58,376
There's a draught here.
Draughts everywhere.

142
00:11:58,543 --> 00:12:02,376
- I'll take this table.
- Certainly, monsieur.

143
00:12:02,543 --> 00:12:05,960
Septime's unfair, don't you think?

144
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:07,751
- He's unfair.
- My word!

145
00:12:07,918 --> 00:12:11,251
Unfair, is he?
You said it.

146
00:12:11,418 --> 00:12:14,251
Sorry. Here.
I'll be fine here.

147
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:20,626
- Oh, my goodness!
- It's nothing, monsieur.

148
00:12:27,168 --> 00:12:30,835
Between the piano and the cold,
I'll take flu.

149
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:32,293
Let's go over here.

150
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,835
- This one's reserved.
- No matter.

151
00:12:36,001 --> 00:12:37,376
Is this all right?

152
00:12:37,543 --> 00:12:39,251
There. Thank you.

153
00:12:40,501 --> 00:12:43,210
Excuse me. Wait.

154
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:47,793
Let's see, let's see...

155
00:12:51,751 --> 00:12:53,001
Come now...

156
00:12:55,376 --> 00:12:59,251
Wait, a poetic idea comes to me.

157
00:12:59,418 --> 00:13:02,793
- Monsieur writes?
- I dabble. A rhyme or two.

158
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:07,001
May I recommend
the duck à la rouennaise?

159
00:13:08,626 --> 00:13:11,085
"Duck à la rouennaise,

160
00:13:11,251 --> 00:13:14,418
roast boar au vélours"...

161
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,626
- Au vélours?
- Au velours.

162
00:13:16,793 --> 00:13:18,751
"Roast boar au velours."

163
00:13:18,918 --> 00:13:22,585
"Rabbit à la cabriole."
Oh! "La cabriole"!

164
00:13:24,668 --> 00:13:28,710
- I don't recommend that.
- You don't?

165
00:13:28,876 --> 00:13:31,710
Wait. Another poetic idea.

166
00:13:39,501 --> 00:13:42,043
- Give me a radish.
- Sorry?

167
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:46,085
- Give me a radish.
- Very well, monsieur. And?

168
00:13:46,251 --> 00:13:49,501
And if I'm still peckish, a yoghurt.

169
00:13:49,668 --> 00:13:51,126
A yoghurt.

170
00:13:51,293 --> 00:13:54,043
- Quick. I'm in a rush.
- It shall be swift.

171
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,251
No. Leave it with me.

172
00:13:58,418 --> 00:14:00,585
What do you advise with a radish?

173
00:14:00,751 --> 00:14:02,876
Monsieur could have a Muscadet.

174
00:14:03,668 --> 00:14:04,876
Is that dry or sweet?

175
00:14:05,085 --> 00:14:07,751
- Rather dry.
- I'd prefer something sweet.

176
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,501
A Sauternes, then.

177
00:14:10,251 --> 00:14:12,001
- Is that sweet?
- Very sweet.

178
00:14:12,626 --> 00:14:17,126
- Too sweet?
- A demi-sec, perhaps?

179
00:14:17,335 --> 00:14:19,626
No. I'd rather a demi-sweet.

180
00:14:21,376 --> 00:14:24,668
Give it here,
since you don't know...

181
00:14:24,835 --> 00:14:28,251
How is your Evian water?

182
00:14:28,418 --> 00:14:30,210
It's very cold.

183
00:14:30,376 --> 00:14:33,085
- And your Perrier water?
- That's good too.

184
00:14:33,251 --> 00:14:37,710
A Perrier water, lukewarm
only slightly sparkling.

185
00:14:40,376 --> 00:14:43,335
Don't snatch it off me.
Gently. Calmly.

186
00:14:44,543 --> 00:14:49,876
No. I asked for a radish.
A radish. There, that's all.

187
00:14:50,918 --> 00:14:52,251
I have no knife.

188
00:14:54,876 --> 00:14:57,210
I don't need it. Thanks.

189
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,793
Ah! Very good. Thank you.
And 10 makes 50.

190
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,251
Thank you.

191
00:16:25,001 --> 00:16:26,501
A pleasant lunch?

192
00:16:28,918 --> 00:16:31,543
Would Monsieur care for a dessert?

193
00:16:31,876 --> 00:16:36,501
A small carrot for Monsieur,
sprinkled with...

194
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:43,418
- Mr Septime!
- Hush!

195
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:44,626
Swine.

196
00:16:44,793 --> 00:16:48,085
Conscientiousness, catering,
French tradition...

197
00:16:48,293 --> 00:16:50,251
Have you forgotten everything?

198
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:53,751
Grandeur, nobility...
You are a swine.

199
00:16:57,835 --> 00:16:59,585
Are you making fun of me?

200
00:17:07,501 --> 00:17:10,835
I don't know what time
Mr Septime will be back.

201
00:17:10,918 --> 00:17:13,835
I'm here. Go away.

202
00:17:14,001 --> 00:17:15,335
He's gone.

203
00:17:16,793 --> 00:17:19,626
He arrived in a wig,
dressed up...

204
00:17:19,793 --> 00:17:22,168
He asked for this table,
then that...

205
00:17:22,335 --> 00:17:24,751
He takes the menu... A radish!

206
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:26,001
A carrot?

207
00:17:26,168 --> 00:17:29,126
He ripped off his wig...
"Swine! Swine!"

208
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:33,251
My God, my God, my God...

209
00:17:33,418 --> 00:17:37,543
I shall be worthy of his choice.
A prestigious head of state...

210
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:42,043
Please, Mr Septime.
We want to choose the table.

211
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:46,168
I'm in charge of security.
I'd like to inspect the premises.

212
00:17:46,335 --> 00:17:48,126
Nothing could be simpler.

213
00:17:52,126 --> 00:17:53,085
Mademoiselle.

214
00:17:53,251 --> 00:17:56,126
Many crowned heads have sat here.

215
00:17:56,293 --> 00:17:57,876
This way, mademoiselle.

216
00:17:58,043 --> 00:18:01,168
Number 15, perhaps? No? Fine.

217
00:18:01,335 --> 00:18:04,335
- Number eight. Over there.
- No. Definitely not eight.

218
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:07,543
His Excellency the president
is very superstitious.

219
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:09,793
- Here, the eight...
- At home too.

220
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,626
- Oh? What about 13?
- 13. Yes.

221
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:17,001
The Queen of England
was sitting there.

222
00:18:17,168 --> 00:18:18,960
There she was, very slim...

223
00:18:19,126 --> 00:18:20,585
The prince was there...

224
00:18:20,751 --> 00:18:23,210
The royal children here.

225
00:18:29,293 --> 00:18:32,460
- No special menu?
- The president trusts you.

226
00:18:32,626 --> 00:18:36,335
- He loves surprises.
- I'll try to please.

227
00:18:36,501 --> 00:18:38,001
There is something.

228
00:18:38,168 --> 00:18:42,085
He insists on tasting
your speciality dessert.

229
00:18:42,251 --> 00:18:45,376
The Septime pyramid.

230
00:18:45,543 --> 00:18:50,543
Tell him that, for his Excellency,
Septime will exceed expectations.

231
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:53,960
- Everything all right?
- You're sure of your staff?

232
00:18:54,126 --> 00:18:56,876
Absolutely.
There are three gendarmes' sons...

233
00:18:57,043 --> 00:18:59,793
There's no bad blood?
You understand me?

234
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:04,251
The only policy here
is customer satisfaction.

235
00:19:04,418 --> 00:19:06,210
Thank you.

236
00:19:18,085 --> 00:19:21,460
- See you tonight, Mr Septime.
- I'll see you out.

237
00:19:25,585 --> 00:19:27,210
My God!

238
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:33,168
You embody the decadence
of French catering!

239
00:19:33,335 --> 00:19:37,001
For the fourth brigade, yours,
4:30 in the rehearsal room,

240
00:19:37,168 --> 00:19:39,626
drama classes applied to catering.

241
00:19:39,793 --> 00:19:41,460
- Again?
- And again!

242
00:19:41,626 --> 00:19:42,543
My God!

243
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:45,460
You come too.
It won't do you any harm.

244
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,418
Smile, damn it!

245
00:19:59,585 --> 00:20:02,835
Smile! Not bad.
You, go on. Quick!

246
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:04,835
Not bad. Go on.

247
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,710
No! Damn it!
Come back here.

248
00:20:07,876 --> 00:20:11,126
I've told you 100 times
to stand like this.

249
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,293
Natural. Normal.

250
00:20:15,543 --> 00:20:19,585
Catch. If you break it,
you'll pay. Go on.

251
00:20:21,168 --> 00:20:23,293
That's not bad.
Your turn.

252
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,085
Your turn, quick!

253
00:20:29,751 --> 00:20:30,793
Enough!

254
00:20:31,543 --> 00:20:32,751
Shut it!

255
00:20:33,376 --> 00:20:35,585
Shut it! There!

256
00:20:39,085 --> 00:20:40,960
Not good.
Take my place.

257
00:20:41,126 --> 00:20:42,585
I'll explain.

258
00:20:42,751 --> 00:20:47,001
Here, you're in the kitchen.
Beyond the door is the restaurant.

259
00:20:47,168 --> 00:20:49,460
We must serve and smile.

260
00:20:49,626 --> 00:20:53,251
The smile is our tip.
There!

261
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,668
I'll show you.

262
00:20:54,835 --> 00:20:57,501
Here, I have problems.
Everybody has.

263
00:20:57,668 --> 00:21:00,418
But we must serve and we shall.

264
00:21:00,585 --> 00:21:02,418
Go on, open it.

265
00:21:02,585 --> 00:21:04,335
And I smile.

266
00:21:04,501 --> 00:21:09,043
Now, my dear Roger
will show you what to do.

267
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:11,043
You have problems.

268
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:12,168
We must serve!

269
00:21:12,335 --> 00:21:14,710
Smile and go.

270
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:21,168
I don't know, Mr Septime.

271
00:21:21,918 --> 00:21:24,126
Maybe it's the pulley.

272
00:21:24,293 --> 00:21:26,626
Stand aside.
You, work that.

273
00:21:29,335 --> 00:21:31,710
- That's better.
- Very good, even.

274
00:21:31,876 --> 00:21:34,543
You stand there.
Wait. Take that.

275
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,001
We'll go again.
You have problems.

276
00:21:37,168 --> 00:21:39,751
You have just had some problems.

277
00:21:39,918 --> 00:21:41,460
And we start again.

278
00:21:41,626 --> 00:21:45,126
You serve,
you smile and you leave.

279
00:21:47,668 --> 00:21:49,085
That was you.

280
00:21:49,668 --> 00:21:51,626
That was you.

281
00:21:51,793 --> 00:21:53,960
That was you.
Come here, Roger.

282
00:21:54,126 --> 00:21:55,376
Come here.

283
00:21:55,543 --> 00:21:57,376
It wasn't me, Mr Septime.

284
00:21:58,043 --> 00:22:00,543
- Note down his punishment.
- May I?

285
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:02,293
Go ahead.

286
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:07,126
Copy out 20 menus at home
for tonight.

287
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:10,751
And I'll add 10 for tomorrow...

288
00:22:11,501 --> 00:22:14,293
- In Gothic!
- Gothic?

289
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,251
My God, my God...

290
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:19,335
You're starting to annoy me
with your my Gods.

291
00:22:19,501 --> 00:22:22,668
- You disapprove of me.
- Oh, at this stage...

292
00:22:22,835 --> 00:22:25,376
Get used to these modern methods.

293
00:22:25,543 --> 00:22:27,543
My God, my God!

294
00:22:38,168 --> 00:22:40,668
Mr Septime!
I was looking for you.

295
00:22:40,835 --> 00:22:41,835
Here I am.

296
00:22:42,001 --> 00:22:46,043
I tidied up the cellar.
There's no more...

297
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:47,418
Come again.

298
00:22:47,585 --> 00:22:51,168
I tidied up the cellar.
There's no more...

299
00:22:51,335 --> 00:22:54,001
Nuits-Saint-Georges 1949.
Correct?

300
00:22:54,168 --> 00:22:57,043
- I'll get some in.
- How nice of you.

301
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:59,960
Tell me, how's your Gothic script?

302
00:23:00,126 --> 00:23:04,168
- Yes. It's very difficult.
- We'll come back to that.

303
00:23:04,335 --> 00:23:07,335
Let's see if everyone's
learnt their lesson.

304
00:23:07,501 --> 00:23:09,751
Pick up your props. Places.

305
00:23:09,918 --> 00:23:13,210
You two who do nothing,
stick that over there.

306
00:23:13,376 --> 00:23:15,793
You two, pushing brooms.
Hop to it!

307
00:23:17,001 --> 00:23:20,043
"My God, my God!"
Yes, I know, it's degrading.

308
00:23:30,168 --> 00:23:32,960
Now, all together.

309
00:23:33,126 --> 00:23:34,585
Come along!

310
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,751
Go on.

311
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:44,085
No. One second. I'll count us in.

312
00:23:44,251 --> 00:23:46,876
And three, four...

313
00:24:05,876 --> 00:24:07,210
Get out.

314
00:24:09,835 --> 00:24:10,668
Come here.

315
00:24:10,835 --> 00:24:14,335
- Was I all right?
- Not bad, my dear Roger.

316
00:24:14,501 --> 00:24:16,418
Two-faced sod!

317
00:24:16,585 --> 00:24:18,335
You, watch yourself.

318
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,126
Three, four...

319
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:41,835
Plié, stretch your leg and hop!

320
00:25:32,793 --> 00:25:35,376
Stop! What's got into you?

321
00:25:35,543 --> 00:25:37,918
What is this collective madness?

322
00:25:38,085 --> 00:25:40,918
That's right.
It was him, Mr Septime.

323
00:25:41,085 --> 00:25:43,085
Why did you speed up?

324
00:25:43,251 --> 00:25:47,210
If I hadn't stopped it,
where would it have led?

325
00:25:47,376 --> 00:25:49,960
- Agitator!
- You're right.

326
00:25:50,126 --> 00:25:52,168
Right. Line up.

327
00:25:52,335 --> 00:25:54,710
You'll pay for that.
You'll see.

328
00:25:54,876 --> 00:25:56,085
Line up. Come on!

329
00:25:56,251 --> 00:26:00,834
Down there, my dear Roger.
You'll pay for that.

330
00:26:05,251 --> 00:26:07,376
Someone tripped you up.

331
00:26:09,543 --> 00:26:11,335
Who did that?

332
00:26:12,543 --> 00:26:16,751
- Bravo! Is this mutiny?
- Mutiny! My God!

333
00:26:16,918 --> 00:26:20,210
- You'll pay tomorrow.
- Why tomorrow, Mr Septime?

334
00:26:20,376 --> 00:26:23,210
Tonight,
a prestigious guest of France,

335
00:26:23,376 --> 00:26:26,126
President Novales,
honours us with his presence.

336
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:30,668
Our restaurant is the embassy
of French gastronomy.

337
00:26:30,835 --> 00:26:33,668
In serving tonight,
you will serve France.

338
00:26:33,835 --> 00:26:36,376
You, agitator, listen a second.

339
00:26:36,543 --> 00:26:38,335
And listen well.

340
00:26:48,376 --> 00:26:49,793
Listen.

341
00:26:55,251 --> 00:26:57,835
Do me an arrangement for tonight.

342
00:26:58,001 --> 00:27:01,085
- Tonight?
- You have two hours. It's enough.

343
00:27:01,251 --> 00:27:05,460
- There must be 30 musicians.
- It'll be easier for three instruments.

344
00:27:05,626 --> 00:27:07,043
A quick shortcut.

345
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:10,210
- Does your violinist play flute?
- Flute?

346
00:27:10,376 --> 00:27:12,710
That'll be fine.
Julien, come here.

347
00:27:12,876 --> 00:27:15,376
Tell me... Open your eyes!
Wake up.

348
00:27:15,543 --> 00:27:19,751
- Did your father play cello?
- Yes. Papa played cello.

349
00:27:19,918 --> 00:27:22,793
You'll hold the cello tonight.

350
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:25,126
When the president arrives

351
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:29,085
I'll give you a discreet signal
to start the anthem, like this.

352
00:27:29,251 --> 00:27:31,418
For instance, let's suppose...

353
00:27:32,668 --> 00:27:34,168
And I'll do...

354
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,501
Don't make fun of me.
You'd better watch yourself.

355
00:28:05,626 --> 00:28:08,793
Mr President,
mademoiselle, monsieur...

356
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,335
What pleasure, what...

357
00:28:11,501 --> 00:28:15,126
Please, Mr Septime. I'm starving.

358
00:28:16,168 --> 00:28:17,960
Excuse me. Where has he gone?

359
00:28:18,126 --> 00:28:19,793
Go and open it!

360
00:28:23,585 --> 00:28:26,168
Here. Sorry. There.

361
00:28:26,585 --> 00:28:29,293
After you.
You, the door!

362
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,543
This way.

363
00:28:52,376 --> 00:28:53,710
This way, please.

364
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:56,501
Your Excellency.

365
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:39,085
These gentlemen will look after you,
Mr President.

366
00:29:39,251 --> 00:29:40,960
I'll be right back.

367
00:29:45,293 --> 00:29:48,168
You're a swine.
You'll pay clearly for that.

368
00:29:48,335 --> 00:29:51,252
It's shameful.
You know it's shameful.

369
00:30:23,835 --> 00:30:25,710
Don't touch that!
No manners.

370
00:30:25,876 --> 00:30:28,335
What's that?
Don't touch that.

371
00:30:28,501 --> 00:30:31,501
I give the orders here!

372
00:30:31,668 --> 00:30:34,126
- Where's your hat?
- I don't have one.

373
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:37,835
Look... Come, now.

374
00:30:38,001 --> 00:30:39,501
Yes. Maybe.

375
00:30:43,585 --> 00:30:46,210
Not you.
My godson will drive.

376
00:30:46,376 --> 00:30:47,751
I like him.

377
00:30:47,918 --> 00:30:50,960
Remember. In the dining room,
pay no attention.

378
00:30:51,126 --> 00:30:54,918
- Is that caramel?
- Don't bother about it. Go.

379
00:31:04,293 --> 00:31:07,793
Yes, I know.
I'm a coward. So what?

380
00:31:08,418 --> 00:31:10,335
Get on, godson!

381
00:31:27,793 --> 00:31:28,793
It's lovely.

382
00:31:38,168 --> 00:31:39,335
Bravo.

383
00:31:48,585 --> 00:31:50,085
That's alcohol.

384
00:32:19,168 --> 00:32:20,585
My God!

385
00:32:20,668 --> 00:32:22,126
What is it?

386
00:32:23,543 --> 00:32:26,210
Don't panic.
It was a surprise.

387
00:32:26,876 --> 00:32:29,835
Don't panic.
It was a surprise.

388
00:32:30,001 --> 00:32:31,793
The president!

389
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,960
The president has disappeared.

390
00:32:34,126 --> 00:32:36,418
- Where's the president?
- Here. No.

391
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,001
- The president.
- He's here. Well, he was.

392
00:32:40,168 --> 00:32:42,543
The president has disappeared!

393
00:32:43,335 --> 00:32:45,626
The president has been kidnapped!

394
00:32:45,793 --> 00:32:49,626
The surprise scared him.
He went for a stroll.

395
00:32:49,793 --> 00:32:52,626
He's not here.
He's playing a joke on us.

396
00:32:52,793 --> 00:32:55,085
- I'll call the police.
- Quick.

397
00:32:55,251 --> 00:32:56,418
Where is he?

398
00:32:57,001 --> 00:32:58,168
Where is he?

399
00:32:58,335 --> 00:33:00,376
President! He's not here.

400
00:33:02,335 --> 00:33:03,918
What's the matter?

401
00:33:06,335 --> 00:33:08,960
President!
Where's the president?

402
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:13,585
Have you never seen me before?

403
00:33:19,543 --> 00:33:22,126
Mr President?
He's not here.

404
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:24,918
Let me through.

405
00:33:25,918 --> 00:33:28,626
- What's that on your face?
- Shut up!

406
00:33:28,793 --> 00:33:31,585
Have you seen a very big chap,

407
00:33:31,751 --> 00:33:33,751
a leader of men?

408
00:33:33,918 --> 00:33:37,501
I only know one big chap here.
That's me.

409
00:33:38,251 --> 00:33:41,626
Listen, Marcel...

410
00:33:42,585 --> 00:33:43,876
No. It's not nice.

411
00:33:44,043 --> 00:33:46,501
It's not nice.
You're not nice.

412
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:50,585
Septime's.
Yes, the restaurant.

413
00:33:50,751 --> 00:33:51,960
Thank you.

414
00:33:54,376 --> 00:33:58,376
I've called the police.
They'll be here in a few minutes.

415
00:33:58,543 --> 00:34:01,710
- Mr Septime, did you find him?
- Sit down.

416
00:34:01,876 --> 00:34:05,876
I've just seen him. He's coming.
It was nothing. Sit down.

417
00:34:06,626 --> 00:34:08,668
Music!

418
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:13,418
Clear off!

419
00:34:24,126 --> 00:34:28,584
- Did you really see him?
- He's here, he's coming!

420
00:34:31,876 --> 00:34:34,876
He isn't here?
He'll be here in two minutes.

421
00:34:42,668 --> 00:34:44,293
What's happened?

422
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:46,168
What's that on your face?

423
00:34:46,335 --> 00:34:47,918
Nothing. We'll find him.

424
00:34:48,085 --> 00:34:49,585
Everything's OK.

425
00:34:49,751 --> 00:34:52,835
Don't tell the police,
or my restaurant has had it.

426
00:34:53,001 --> 00:34:56,460
But we'll find him.
Everything's fine.

427
00:34:56,626 --> 00:35:00,210
Who? I don't know.
Everything's fine.

428
00:35:00,376 --> 00:35:01,460
Everything's fine.

429
00:35:02,876 --> 00:35:04,335
Yes. "Everything's fine."

430
00:35:04,501 --> 00:35:06,168
HEAD OF STATE KIDNAPPED

431
00:35:06,668 --> 00:35:08,251
It just keeps getting better.

432
00:35:09,668 --> 00:35:14,335
A head of state
kidnapped from your restaurant.

433
00:35:15,168 --> 00:35:17,043
The honour of France at stake.

434
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:19,918
Diplomatic complications
in the pipeline.

435
00:35:20,085 --> 00:35:24,543
All we're missing
is a declaration of war.

436
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:27,043
No need to tell the police!

437
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:29,918
- I lost my head.
- Did you get it back?

438
00:35:30,085 --> 00:35:32,585
- Your head!
- Yes. It's here.

439
00:35:33,918 --> 00:35:36,043
Well, get this into it.

440
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:41,460
A president has disappeared
from your restaurant.

441
00:35:41,626 --> 00:35:43,335
He must be found.

442
00:35:43,501 --> 00:35:46,501
Did he disappear from your restaurant
or not?

443
00:35:46,668 --> 00:35:50,293
- You're the prime suspect.
- What would I do with a president?

444
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:53,376
A chef would be more useful.

445
00:35:53,543 --> 00:35:57,335
- You think that's funny?
- No, Commissioner.

446
00:35:57,501 --> 00:35:59,168
Me neither.

447
00:36:01,793 --> 00:36:04,585
An abduction like that
wasn't improvised.

448
00:36:06,126 --> 00:36:09,168
The terrorists had people
on the inside.

449
00:36:09,335 --> 00:36:11,460
- Where?
- In your hole!

450
00:36:11,626 --> 00:36:13,460
I won't have you saying...

451
00:36:13,626 --> 00:36:16,168
- You're sure of your staff?
- As of myself.

452
00:36:16,335 --> 00:36:18,918
Yes. Let's talk about you.

453
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,918
You're a bachelor, aren't you?

454
00:36:32,293 --> 00:36:34,001
At your age?

455
00:36:34,168 --> 00:36:36,501
Built like you are?
Oh, yes!

456
00:36:37,293 --> 00:36:39,043
Is that normal?

457
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:42,876
Tell me about your relationships.
You see what I mean?

458
00:36:43,043 --> 00:36:46,001
My relationships
are with the Parisian elite...

459
00:36:46,168 --> 00:36:48,085
Do you take me for a fool?

460
00:36:48,251 --> 00:36:52,918
Tell me. It won't leave here.
Nor will you, if you lie.

461
00:36:53,793 --> 00:36:56,585
My entire life is my restaurant...

462
00:36:56,751 --> 00:37:00,168
Don't tell me your recipe
for happiness is limited

463
00:37:00,335 --> 00:37:03,876
to gooseberry charlotte
and goose canapé!

464
00:37:05,168 --> 00:37:08,460
Look, Commissioner,
I'll come clean.

465
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:13,043
- At 16, entering the kitchen...
- Was like taking the cloth.

466
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:14,502
That's right.

467
00:37:14,668 --> 00:37:17,876
But I warn you, Father,

468
00:37:18,043 --> 00:37:20,876
if you don't want us
to close your monastery...

469
00:37:21,043 --> 00:37:23,001
Oh, yes I can!

470
00:37:23,168 --> 00:37:26,960
- Show me your good faith.
- How?

471
00:37:27,126 --> 00:37:30,209
By collaborating closely
with my department.

472
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,002
My God!

473
00:37:36,168 --> 00:37:38,668
Certain compatriots
of President Novales,

474
00:37:38,835 --> 00:37:40,918
soldiers opposed to his regime,

475
00:37:41,085 --> 00:37:44,126
left the country
when he came to power.

476
00:37:44,293 --> 00:37:49,001
We have the description of some
of the terrorists hiding in France

477
00:37:49,168 --> 00:37:51,668
in secret organisations.

478
00:37:51,835 --> 00:37:54,751
The foreign desk gave us this.

479
00:37:54,918 --> 00:37:56,751
Come and see.

480
00:37:56,918 --> 00:38:00,960
Do any of these faces
look like your customers?

481
00:38:02,585 --> 00:38:07,501
No, Commissioner.
We don't serve that kind.

482
00:38:32,001 --> 00:38:34,668
What got into you?
Did you get the wrong date?

483
00:38:34,835 --> 00:38:37,876
You were meant to kidnap him
at the weekend at the airport.

484
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,710
Where have you put him?

485
00:38:40,585 --> 00:38:41,626
Well?

486
00:38:41,793 --> 00:38:44,793
- We've kidnapped nobody.
- Nobody.

487
00:38:45,543 --> 00:38:47,251
What? Nobody?

488
00:38:47,418 --> 00:38:51,293
- We were awaiting orders.
- We read about it in the press.

489
00:38:52,918 --> 00:38:55,251
Then who has kidnapped him?

490
00:38:55,418 --> 00:38:56,918
Who?

491
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:01,376
Another secret organisation.

492
00:39:02,168 --> 00:39:05,793
Who, then? Ah, the traitors!
They'll pay for this.

493
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,293
We have to catch them first.

494
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:11,460
There's only one way.
Go back to the source.

495
00:39:11,626 --> 00:39:12,960
The restaurant.

496
00:39:13,626 --> 00:39:14,918
Indeed.

497
00:39:15,085 --> 00:39:18,127
Meanwhile, watch Septime all day.

498
00:39:18,293 --> 00:39:20,626
We'll meet there this evening.

499
00:39:20,793 --> 00:39:24,793
Don't lose him.
He's being questioned now.

500
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,418
Leave immediately.
Go, General.

501
00:39:27,585 --> 00:39:29,793
Yes, sir, Captain.

502
00:39:32,918 --> 00:39:35,210
I'll give you these photos.

503
00:39:35,376 --> 00:39:40,793
If one of these terrorists shows up,
call me immediately.

504
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:45,210
But if I'm being watched
and I can't talk freely...

505
00:39:45,376 --> 00:39:47,835
- My telephone...
- Yes. I understand.

506
00:39:48,001 --> 00:39:49,876
- We're here and...
- Yes!

507
00:39:50,043 --> 00:39:51,751
You sneeze.

508
00:39:51,918 --> 00:39:54,751
Sneeze three times.
I'll understand and I'll come.

509
00:39:54,918 --> 00:40:00,293
I hope I won't have to show you
my speciality.

510
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,876
What speciality?

511
00:40:02,585 --> 00:40:05,876
Take a plump suspect.

512
00:40:07,585 --> 00:40:09,918
Surround him
with four fat inspectors.

513
00:40:11,418 --> 00:40:15,376
Marinate for 48 hours in a steamer.

514
00:40:15,543 --> 00:40:18,668
That'll loosen
even the most reluctant of tongues.

515
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:23,543
- Understand?
- Yes, Commissioner.

516
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:25,126
Go to it.

517
00:40:34,501 --> 00:40:35,793
There he is!

518
00:40:36,418 --> 00:40:39,210
Leave me alone.
I've nothing to say.

519
00:40:46,293 --> 00:40:47,710
Leave me alone.

520
00:40:47,876 --> 00:40:49,626
Leave me alone!

521
00:40:55,251 --> 00:40:56,501
Let's go.

522
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:05,876
Police, terrorists!
What next?

523
00:41:06,043 --> 00:41:08,751
- Hello, Mr Septime.
- What's going on?

524
00:41:08,918 --> 00:41:13,543
- You don't seem happy.
- Oh, yes. I'm thrilled.

525
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:16,376
Thrilled. He's thrilled!

526
00:41:16,543 --> 00:41:20,626
When the people's benefactor
is among torturers!

527
00:41:21,835 --> 00:41:25,626
- You'll have to make amends.
- Amends for what?

528
00:41:25,793 --> 00:41:29,960
Our president was kidnapped
in your restaurant, right?

529
00:41:30,668 --> 00:41:34,085
Back home, that's enough
to have you shot.

530
00:41:35,751 --> 00:41:39,001
Try your luck.
Who needs a ticket?

531
00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:44,168
Look.

532
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:47,001
Don't try that again.
Listen.

533
00:41:47,168 --> 00:41:52,001
You're going to help me
lure the wolves out of their lair.

534
00:41:52,168 --> 00:41:55,668
You'll provoke them by telling
the papers you saw them.

535
00:41:55,835 --> 00:41:59,460
- It's not true!
- The terrorists will think it's true.

536
00:41:59,626 --> 00:42:03,251
- They'll try to kill me.
- But they'll show themselves.

537
00:42:03,418 --> 00:42:06,043
We catch them and shoot them.

538
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:08,418
Before they kill you.

539
00:42:08,585 --> 00:42:10,293
What if they kill me first?

540
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:14,376
Choose: them later
or me right now.

541
00:42:22,918 --> 00:42:24,543
Murderer!

542
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,376
Mind the car!

543
00:42:58,793 --> 00:43:00,710
That takes the biscuit!

544
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:15,626
Well? What have you decided?

545
00:43:15,793 --> 00:43:18,543
Let's talk somewhere more peaceful.

546
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:20,918
- Where?
- I don't know.

547
00:43:21,085 --> 00:43:23,376
Come for dinner one night.

548
00:43:23,543 --> 00:43:25,918
No. Not one night. Tonight!

549
00:43:32,501 --> 00:43:33,585
Wait.

550
00:44:14,251 --> 00:44:18,126
OK? Everything all right?

551
00:44:20,168 --> 00:44:22,376
- All right?
- Fine, thank you.

552
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:33,501
Mademoiselle, monsieur, this way.

553
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:40,876
- Have you chosen?
- I've chosen a good table.

554
00:44:41,043 --> 00:44:44,460
Have you had time
to think about me?

555
00:44:44,626 --> 00:44:47,501
Look...
I haven't stopped.

556
00:44:47,668 --> 00:44:51,335
Seriously. Have you thought
about my proposal?

557
00:44:51,501 --> 00:44:54,085
We can talk after the rush.

558
00:44:54,251 --> 00:44:57,626
It'd be better for you
before the rush.

559
00:45:16,585 --> 00:45:19,001
Mr Septime,
there's no more crayfish.

560
00:45:19,168 --> 00:45:22,626
- What do we do?
- We must sneeze.

561
00:45:36,126 --> 00:45:37,543
One!

562
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:39,043
Two!

563
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:41,460
- Three! Get it?
- Bravo. We're on our way.

564
00:45:41,626 --> 00:45:43,460
Be quick!

565
00:45:51,585 --> 00:45:53,918
I'll be right there.
Just a second.

566
00:45:59,043 --> 00:46:00,668
There. I sneezed.

567
00:46:00,835 --> 00:46:04,043
The police are coming.
They're like rats in a trap.

568
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:05,668
Look.

569
00:46:08,751 --> 00:46:10,043
Calm down.

570
00:46:10,251 --> 00:46:13,793
I've planned it all. Leave it to me.
I'll keep them here.

571
00:46:21,543 --> 00:46:25,460
- I'm all yours.
- The chef is so angry!

572
00:46:25,626 --> 00:46:27,460
- Why?
- He wants to come here.

573
00:46:27,626 --> 00:46:29,960
Let him stay there. I'll go to him.

574
00:46:30,126 --> 00:46:32,876
Come along! I've things to do here.

575
00:46:33,043 --> 00:46:34,835
What would you like?
Oh, sorry...

576
00:46:35,001 --> 00:46:37,668
Sit down here.

577
00:46:38,751 --> 00:46:40,668
Good resemblance.

578
00:46:40,835 --> 00:46:42,501
Good photograph.

579
00:46:42,668 --> 00:46:45,918
- Aficionado!
- I don't understand Spanish.

580
00:46:46,085 --> 00:46:48,085
You understand it perfectly.

581
00:46:48,251 --> 00:46:50,376
- Yes. You're right.
- Let's chat.

582
00:46:50,543 --> 00:46:54,376
You can invite us to drink
your best champagne.

583
00:46:57,126 --> 00:47:00,376
Mr Septime is treating us
to his best champagne.

584
00:47:00,543 --> 00:47:02,876
That's not possible!
Is it?

585
00:47:08,585 --> 00:47:11,543
I don't understand.
What are you saying?

586
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:12,876
...the police...

587
00:47:13,043 --> 00:47:15,251
Are you taking the mickey?

588
00:47:16,668 --> 00:47:18,668
...whether it's dry or sweet.

589
00:47:18,835 --> 00:47:20,918
His best champagne!

590
00:47:21,085 --> 00:47:23,251
- I'll help him.
- Sit down.

591
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:29,626
- That's the firemen.
- No.

592
00:47:30,293 --> 00:47:31,835
It is, it's the firemen.

593
00:47:32,043 --> 00:47:36,793
Firemen go B-A, B-A.
The police go D-A, D-A.

594
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,168
- That's B-A, B-A.
- That's D-A, D-A.

595
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:46,001
- That's B-A, B-A, B-A.
- No, it's...

596
00:47:46,168 --> 00:47:48,501
The police are coming. We must leave.

597
00:47:48,668 --> 00:47:50,335
Leave?
And the champagne?

598
00:47:50,501 --> 00:47:52,168
- At the house.
- The bill.

599
00:47:52,335 --> 00:47:54,085
The bill's for you.

600
00:48:12,376 --> 00:48:13,501
Well?

601
00:48:15,543 --> 00:48:17,543
I get it. Well? Where are they?

602
00:48:18,335 --> 00:48:20,168
Behind.

603
00:48:21,335 --> 00:48:22,460
No one's there.

604
00:48:25,918 --> 00:48:29,168
Where are they?
I'll rip their eyes out!

605
00:48:29,335 --> 00:48:33,335
- You let them go, you imbecile!
- Take the hysterical woman away.

606
00:48:33,501 --> 00:48:36,293
You're addressing
the president's secretary.

607
00:48:36,501 --> 00:48:39,210
Forgive me, mademoiselle.
My respects.

608
00:48:39,376 --> 00:48:41,585
- Run after them.
- Whom?

609
00:48:41,793 --> 00:48:44,710
- Didn't the owner of this dive say?
- Please!

610
00:48:44,876 --> 00:48:46,210
The terrorists!

611
00:48:46,418 --> 00:48:49,293
- Where are they?
- Far away. I told you 15 times.

612
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:54,835
I sneezed five times.
You didn't get it at all!

613
00:48:55,001 --> 00:48:56,585
I didn't get it?

614
00:48:56,751 --> 00:49:01,126
Insulting a representative
of authority while on duty.

615
00:49:01,293 --> 00:49:03,376
You'll spend the night in a cell.

616
00:49:03,585 --> 00:49:07,585
- Take him away!
- I won't tolerate it!

617
00:49:09,168 --> 00:49:13,501
I order you to let me go.
Let me go, damn it!

618
00:49:16,876 --> 00:49:19,793
In a black maria?
How shameful!

619
00:49:21,085 --> 00:49:24,501
I'll complain to the minister
tomorrow morning!

620
00:49:31,251 --> 00:49:33,126
Wait for me. I'll be right back.

621
00:49:34,251 --> 00:49:35,543
Leave us.

622
00:49:36,585 --> 00:49:41,543
Well? I hope a night's meditation
was profitable.

623
00:49:42,585 --> 00:49:44,918
I'll be magnanimous.
You're free.

624
00:49:45,085 --> 00:49:47,376
- Good.
- Your car is here.

625
00:49:47,543 --> 00:49:50,126
- Everything's fine?
- Everything's fine.

626
00:49:50,293 --> 00:49:53,585
Now the terrorists
will be looking to kill you.

627
00:49:53,751 --> 00:49:56,668
- What?
- You're under our protection.

628
00:49:56,835 --> 00:49:58,043
Is that understood?

629
00:49:58,210 --> 00:50:01,085
We start the operation again.
You've no choice.

630
00:50:01,251 --> 00:50:02,876
It's your last chance.

631
00:50:03,793 --> 00:50:05,251
What do I do?

632
00:50:09,793 --> 00:50:12,960
Goodbye, Commissioner...

633
00:50:36,835 --> 00:50:38,918
There he is!

634
00:50:44,835 --> 00:50:46,668
Hello, Septime.

635
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:49,626
Don't turn around.
Carry straight on.

636
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:52,960
You're going to obey me.

637
00:50:53,126 --> 00:50:56,001
We're going for a little spin.

638
00:50:56,168 --> 00:50:59,876
I want to talk,
but I need somewhere more peaceful.

639
00:51:00,043 --> 00:51:04,710
We'll carry on this chat later.
Head for the Saint-Cloud Park.

640
00:51:04,876 --> 00:51:07,168
- Got that?
- Saint-Cloud Park.

641
00:51:07,335 --> 00:51:09,793
And be very careful.

642
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:12,085
Remember your life is at stake.

643
00:51:15,751 --> 00:51:17,751
POLICE HEADQUARTERS

644
00:51:19,251 --> 00:51:21,668
No, no, no!

645
00:51:21,835 --> 00:51:23,751
Keep moving.
Look where you are!

646
00:51:23,918 --> 00:51:25,126
Come here.

647
00:51:25,293 --> 00:51:26,543
Come here!

648
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:30,543
Don't look suspicious.
Look into the air.

649
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:33,585
There's a terrorist
hiding in my back seat.

650
00:51:33,751 --> 00:51:36,335
Underneath...
I don't know, but look.

651
00:51:36,501 --> 00:51:38,835
No, no. Discreetly.

652
00:51:39,001 --> 00:51:41,793
Is he there, then?

653
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:45,793
Lucky I'm in a good mood.
Go on, move along!

654
00:51:46,001 --> 00:51:50,501
I tell you, he's hiding there.
He wants to kill me.

655
00:51:50,668 --> 00:51:52,918
He's a killer. He wants to kill me.

656
00:51:53,126 --> 00:51:56,126
Look. You can see
there's nobody there.

657
00:51:57,543 --> 00:52:00,001
He's gone.
Or he's in the trunk.

658
00:52:00,168 --> 00:52:02,793
In the trunk?
Let's check the trunk.

659
00:52:04,710 --> 00:52:06,376
- Come on.
- Be careful.

660
00:52:06,543 --> 00:52:09,001
Are you armed? He's dangerous.

661
00:52:09,168 --> 00:52:11,251
It'll be fine. Don't worry.

662
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:16,543
He's gone.
Oh, there's nobody there.

663
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:19,293
- But he talked to me.
- He won't talk now.

664
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:22,251
He can't have gone far.
Isn't he underneath?

665
00:52:22,418 --> 00:52:24,918
- He talked to me.
- Go home and sleep.

666
00:52:25,085 --> 00:52:28,460
- Is he underneath?
- Move along. He won't talk now.

667
00:52:28,626 --> 00:52:30,751
He's not behind? Thank you.

668
00:52:30,918 --> 00:52:32,668
That's right. Go on.

669
00:52:36,751 --> 00:52:38,543
- Septime.
- I don't believe it!

670
00:52:38,710 --> 00:52:43,001
That wasn't very sensible.
You are most unwise.

671
00:52:43,168 --> 00:52:45,501
You'd better not try again.

672
00:52:46,668 --> 00:52:50,668
Carry on without turning round.
Saint-Cloud, I said.

673
00:52:50,835 --> 00:52:55,627
It's a peaceful spot where I can
address your conscience.

674
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:17,668
Now get out, Septime.

675
00:53:17,835 --> 00:53:22,085
Come and sit in the back with me.
We can have a little chat.

676
00:53:27,626 --> 00:53:29,043
Sit down!

677
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:35,835
No. I'm not the invisible man.

678
00:53:36,001 --> 00:53:38,251
Search, Septime.

679
00:53:40,418 --> 00:53:43,001
I'm behind you.

680
00:53:45,751 --> 00:53:47,585
Pick up the paper.

681
00:53:50,210 --> 00:53:51,668
<i>There I am.</i>

682
00:53:54,168 --> 00:53:57,460
<i>And now you can listen to me.</i>

683
00:53:58,835 --> 00:54:00,918
<i>I didn't set up this business</i>

684
00:54:01,085 --> 00:54:04,376
<i>to tell you Aunt Lucie's
latest recipe.</i>

685
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:07,210
<i>You'll be eliminated forthwith</i>

686
00:54:07,376 --> 00:54:10,293
<i>if you don't carry out
my orders carefully.</i>

687
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:11,793
<i>They are simple.</i>

688
00:54:12,501 --> 00:54:15,210
<i>You ask for an audience
with the minister.</i>

689
00:54:15,376 --> 00:54:19,210
<i>The commissioner
you've just seen will help.</i>

690
00:54:19,376 --> 00:54:20,210
<i>And then</i>

691
00:54:20,418 --> 00:54:25,585
<i>I'll say:
Yes, Minister, gentlemen,</i>

692
00:54:25,751 --> 00:54:29,626
<i>we are holding President Novales.</i>

693
00:54:29,793 --> 00:54:32,751
<i>We didn't kidnap him
for political ends.</i>

694
00:54:32,918 --> 00:54:38,043
<i>We are an independent group
unaffiliated to parties,</i>

695
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:41,501
<i>which wants to live
free of dishonest compromise.</i>

696
00:54:41,668 --> 00:54:44,001
<i>We have decided this:</i>

697
00:54:45,293 --> 00:54:48,376
<i>if the sum of 200 million
in treasury bonds</i>

698
00:54:48,543 --> 00:54:53,793
<i>doesn't reach us within three days
through Mr Septime,</i>

699
00:54:54,001 --> 00:54:57,501
<i>not only will he be shot dead,</i>

700
00:54:57,668 --> 00:55:00,585
<i>but President Novales
will face a firing squad</i>

701
00:55:00,793 --> 00:55:03,585
<i>with all the honours
due to his rank.</i>

702
00:55:04,043 --> 00:55:08,585
Imagine the international
repercussions for France

703
00:55:08,793 --> 00:55:13,376
if you abandon your guest
to such a tragic fate.

704
00:55:13,585 --> 00:55:17,668
<i>Mr Septime, the ransom carrier,
will receive our instructions.</i>

705
00:55:17,835 --> 00:55:21,626
<i>An itinerary will be communicated
to him as he progresses.</i>

706
00:55:22,085 --> 00:55:24,710
<i>Our next broadcast will be
tomorrow morning.</i>

707
00:55:24,793 --> 00:55:27,085
<i>Resume listening at 11 o'clock.</i>

708
00:55:31,418 --> 00:55:34,335
What can we do?
We can't get out of it.

709
00:55:34,501 --> 00:55:36,418
Indeed, Minister.

710
00:55:36,585 --> 00:55:39,543
If the president were executed,
we'd look silly.

711
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:41,210
What about me, Minister?

712
00:55:41,376 --> 00:55:46,460
Yes, you, of course.
But him!

713
00:55:46,626 --> 00:55:50,043
All I can do is raise the money,

714
00:55:50,210 --> 00:55:53,168
and you must prove yourself
worthy of our trust.

715
00:55:53,335 --> 00:55:55,251
Come, my good friend.

716
00:55:55,418 --> 00:55:59,001
Don't worry.
It'll all be fine. You'll see.

717
00:55:59,168 --> 00:56:00,293
Yes, I'll see.

718
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:02,918
Try to think of something else.

719
00:56:03,085 --> 00:56:06,626
I'll call you tomorrow
to hand over the money.

720
00:56:06,793 --> 00:56:09,376
Will I have to sneeze?

721
00:56:09,543 --> 00:56:13,168
I don't see why.
And sleep.

722
00:56:13,335 --> 00:56:16,293
I want a fighting-fit Septime.

723
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:19,793
Good night, Commissioner.

724
00:56:21,876 --> 00:56:25,001
It's all going very well.
Wonderfully.

725
00:56:25,168 --> 00:56:27,668
Your machinations are Machiavellian.

726
00:56:27,835 --> 00:56:31,585
It's progress in the service
of old principles.

727
00:56:31,751 --> 00:56:34,585
Bait. Always bait the hook.
Like in fishing.

728
00:56:34,751 --> 00:56:37,751
Imagine the terrorists
who kidnapped the president

729
00:56:37,918 --> 00:56:41,918
when they hear that others
are trying to pocket 200 million.

730
00:56:42,085 --> 00:56:43,876
They'll show themselves.

731
00:56:44,043 --> 00:56:47,210
They'll follow brave Septime
and we'll pick them up.

732
00:56:47,376 --> 00:56:51,668
200 million on the loose!
You could have said 50.

733
00:56:51,835 --> 00:56:54,876
It wouldn't have sounded serious,
Minister.

734
00:56:55,043 --> 00:56:57,418
Do we start the operation
from here?

735
00:56:57,585 --> 00:56:59,585
No, dear chap.
From your office.

736
00:56:59,751 --> 00:57:02,459
It's your idea, not mine.

737
00:57:02,626 --> 00:57:07,085
Tomorrow I'll have
the treasury bonds. I'll bring them.

738
00:57:08,501 --> 00:57:11,376
Thank you most kindly, Minister.

739
00:57:19,168 --> 00:57:20,793
There, my dear Septime.

740
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:25,376
You'll drop the ransom
where they tell you and then call me.

741
00:57:25,543 --> 00:57:27,585
If I can. I mean, I hope so.

742
00:57:27,751 --> 00:57:30,126
Come on, buck up!

743
00:57:30,293 --> 00:57:32,793
All you have to do is your duty.

744
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,543
We'll do ours.

745
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:38,085
Don't have me followed!
Did you hear?

746
00:57:38,251 --> 00:57:41,668
They won't hesitate to execute me,
and the president too.

747
00:57:41,835 --> 00:57:45,876
They'll execute the president.
I'll be executed, anyway.

748
00:57:46,585 --> 00:57:48,626
- Septime...
- Yes.

749
00:57:48,793 --> 00:57:50,126
Look at me.

750
00:57:51,668 --> 00:57:53,460
Is my word enough or not?

751
00:57:55,293 --> 00:57:56,835
Yes.

752
00:57:57,001 --> 00:57:59,710
The eyes of France are upon you.

753
00:58:02,585 --> 00:58:05,085
And if you accomplish your mission,

754
00:58:05,251 --> 00:58:08,085
it will show its gratitude.

755
00:58:12,043 --> 00:58:14,418
- The same?
- I promise.

756
00:58:15,501 --> 00:58:16,918
The same colour?

757
00:58:19,376 --> 00:58:20,876
Yes.

758
00:58:26,085 --> 00:58:27,751
Bon voyage, Septime.

759
00:58:38,751 --> 00:58:39,835
Go on.

760
00:58:51,001 --> 00:58:52,001
Well?

761
00:58:52,168 --> 00:58:55,710
The satellite is in orbit.
All we have to do is guide it.

762
00:58:55,876 --> 00:58:59,210
- What if it fails?
- No danger.

763
00:58:59,376 --> 00:59:00,960
Septime knows well enough

764
00:59:01,126 --> 00:59:04,251
you can't make an omelette
without breaking eggs.

765
00:59:04,418 --> 00:59:07,626
A 200-million omelette
à la Septime, quite a feast!

766
00:59:07,793 --> 00:59:13,210
- We're watching his every move.
- I find that very bold.

767
00:59:13,376 --> 00:59:15,751
- If I may...
- Please.

768
00:59:20,126 --> 00:59:23,085
There he is. You'll see.

769
00:59:23,251 --> 00:59:25,626
11 o'clock. Demonstration.

770
00:59:28,835 --> 00:59:30,085
Hello, Septime?

771
00:59:31,085 --> 00:59:33,085
<i>Go to the newspaper kiosk.</i>

772
00:59:36,626 --> 00:59:38,501
We'll have him go around it.

773
00:59:39,793 --> 00:59:42,376
Stop! Walk around the kiosk.

774
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:49,335
Faster.

775
00:59:54,501 --> 00:59:56,376
<i>Faster than that!</i>

776
01:00:04,126 --> 01:00:06,918
<i>Stop! Straight ahead now.</i>

777
01:00:11,210 --> 01:00:12,210
Stop!

778
01:00:12,376 --> 01:00:14,335
Go to your car.

779
01:00:17,585 --> 01:00:21,043
<i>Septime! I said go to your car.</i>

780
01:00:27,835 --> 01:00:29,793
Are you getting in your car or not?

781
01:00:29,918 --> 01:00:33,876
<i>Do so, and wait for my instructions.</i>

782
01:00:34,043 --> 01:00:38,043
<i>Rest and recover your strength.
You're going on a long trip.</i>

783
01:00:42,376 --> 01:00:45,210
There.
Excuse me, Minister.

784
01:00:49,376 --> 01:00:51,835
- Promising.
- Just breaking it in.

785
01:00:52,001 --> 01:00:54,751
It'll be fine, you'll see.

786
01:00:54,918 --> 01:00:57,501
I have to call the radio and the press.

787
01:00:57,710 --> 01:01:02,585
"The heroic Frenchman will be
the last-chance messenger..."

788
01:01:02,751 --> 01:01:05,501
The scum!
Daring to demand a ransom!

789
01:01:05,668 --> 01:01:07,876
Old traditions are dying, sir.

790
01:01:08,043 --> 01:01:11,001
Men don't risk their lives
for honour.

791
01:01:11,168 --> 01:01:12,793
But that's the kind of men we are.

792
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:16,543
We must intercept the ransom
for our noble cause.

793
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:19,501
It won't fall into corrupt hands.

794
01:01:19,668 --> 01:01:23,418
We must be cautious.
This Septime will be watched.

795
01:01:23,626 --> 01:01:26,751
First, we'll start
by following him.

796
01:01:26,918 --> 01:01:28,918
But the first chance we get...

797
01:01:31,001 --> 01:01:32,793
<i>Septime!</i>

798
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:36,793
<i>After the tunnel,
head towards the pass. Out.</i>

799
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:00,043
There he is!

800
01:02:00,210 --> 01:02:01,210
Go on.

801
01:02:01,376 --> 01:02:04,793
Go straight on for now.

802
01:02:06,085 --> 01:02:09,210
<i>Don't forget we're still here.</i>

803
01:02:14,751 --> 01:02:19,543
They'll soon be after him,
and we'll get to the president.

804
01:02:19,710 --> 01:02:23,627
One has to wait in the shadows
to see clearly.

805
01:02:23,793 --> 01:02:27,918
Your idea is excellent.
You surprised us. Eh, Henri?

806
01:02:48,876 --> 01:02:51,126
This way, we'll be ahead of him.

807
01:02:51,293 --> 01:02:53,543
To follow well, one must precede.

808
01:02:53,751 --> 01:02:57,543
- And we know where he's going.
- So we won't lose him.

809
01:02:59,001 --> 01:03:00,543
Let's hit the road.

810
01:03:06,876 --> 01:03:09,585
Are we going to dawdle around
like this for long?

811
01:03:09,751 --> 01:03:13,626
We keep watch
and see where he leads us.

812
01:03:18,335 --> 01:03:22,418
Oh, there's snow now.
Snow!

813
01:03:39,876 --> 01:03:41,168
We have a nibble.

814
01:03:41,876 --> 01:03:43,876
What do our customers look like?

815
01:03:44,501 --> 01:03:45,626
A convertible.

816
01:03:47,126 --> 01:03:49,668
Followed by an American car.

817
01:03:50,210 --> 01:03:53,835
Heading the procession
is our friend Septime...

818
01:03:55,085 --> 01:03:57,918
...closely followed
by a ravishing blonde.

819
01:03:58,376 --> 01:03:59,959
Charming!

820
01:04:02,668 --> 01:04:06,126
Followed by the very full limousine.
It's working.

821
01:04:06,293 --> 01:04:07,501
Go on.

822
01:04:10,585 --> 01:04:11,793
Hello, Septime?

823
01:04:13,293 --> 01:04:16,710
<i>In three minutes, you'll reach
Black Rock Pass.</i>

824
01:04:16,876 --> 01:04:20,793
After the pass,
go through the village

825
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:24,668
and turn right towards Val d'Isère.

826
01:04:24,876 --> 01:04:28,585
<i>I repeat: after the pass,
towards Val d'Isère.</i>

827
01:04:28,751 --> 01:04:32,460
Val d'Isère,
Hotel de la Poste, two stars,

828
01:04:32,626 --> 01:04:37,501
frogs' legs à la savoyarde,
saddle of lamb in pepper sauce.

829
01:04:39,418 --> 01:04:42,126
Let's move on to the next stage.

830
01:05:05,293 --> 01:05:07,751
Good day.
Everything's ready. This way.

831
01:05:07,918 --> 01:05:09,293
Perfect.

832
01:05:10,293 --> 01:05:12,710
The garage is at the rear.

833
01:06:01,668 --> 01:06:04,835
Take him in hand,
but don't scare our brave Septime.

834
01:06:05,001 --> 01:06:07,001
Hello, Septime, do you read?

835
01:06:07,668 --> 01:06:11,376
<i>Don't forget
you're carrying all our hopes.</i>

836
01:06:12,210 --> 01:06:14,835
- <i>Careful, the road is slippery.</i>
- Yes. Thank you.

837
01:06:15,001 --> 01:06:17,793
<i>If you skid, don't ever brake.</i>

838
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:20,585
<i>Accelerate into the skid.</i>

839
01:06:20,751 --> 01:06:22,376
That's right.

840
01:06:22,543 --> 01:06:24,126
Into it?

841
01:06:28,168 --> 01:06:29,251
The stop sign!

842
01:06:29,418 --> 01:06:30,543
Let's go.

843
01:06:53,168 --> 01:06:56,585
Oh, the fools!
They'll spoil everything.

844
01:06:57,585 --> 01:06:59,335
Always getting in the way.

845
01:06:59,918 --> 01:07:02,376
That wasn't meant to happen.

846
01:07:12,376 --> 01:07:14,335
If they catch him,
we've had it.

847
01:07:16,793 --> 01:07:19,126
Police motorbikes!
What do they want?

848
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:30,960
Call him. Tell him to step on it.

849
01:07:33,001 --> 01:07:35,668
If you're caught, you'll be executed.

850
01:07:35,876 --> 01:07:38,043
<i>Quick, hurry. Don't wait.</i>

851
01:07:38,210 --> 01:07:39,460
Go now!

852
01:07:52,168 --> 01:07:54,168
They've lost ground. It's OK.

853
01:07:57,668 --> 01:08:00,501
This Mr Septime is very good.

854
01:08:01,626 --> 01:08:03,501
I've lost them.

855
01:08:15,085 --> 01:08:17,793
There they are! I've had it.

856
01:08:19,501 --> 01:08:22,668
"If you skid"...
What did he tell me?

857
01:08:22,835 --> 01:08:26,251
"If you skid,
brake in the opposite direction"...

858
01:08:26,418 --> 01:08:27,585
I don't remember.

859
01:08:28,085 --> 01:08:29,751
Lock the...

860
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:36,210
They're getting closer.

861
01:08:37,335 --> 01:08:38,543
I've had it.

862
01:08:39,043 --> 01:08:40,418
I've had it!

863
01:08:55,501 --> 01:08:57,835
Well, well. Let's go down for a look.

864
01:09:00,918 --> 01:09:03,626
Here's our first customer.

865
01:09:04,418 --> 01:09:06,960
See, my idea works pretty well!

866
01:09:07,126 --> 01:09:10,376
We'll see if she's after Septime.
Get him to speed up.

867
01:09:11,168 --> 01:09:13,210
<i>Faster, Septime. Faster!</i>

868
01:09:13,376 --> 01:09:17,210
"Faster!"
It's easy to say over a microphone.

869
01:09:22,376 --> 01:09:23,376
Go!

870
01:09:23,543 --> 01:09:26,376
I can't.
I can't!

871
01:09:27,335 --> 01:09:29,001
- <i>Faster, Septime.</i>
- I can't.

872
01:09:29,835 --> 01:09:32,001
- <i>Faster, Septime.</i>
- I can't.

873
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:34,793
- <i>Faster, Septime.</i>
- I can't!

874
01:09:47,251 --> 01:09:50,835
She doesn't like cops.
She must be in on it.

875
01:09:52,835 --> 01:09:55,085
Here are our family friends again.

876
01:09:55,251 --> 01:09:57,626
Like a procession.
Better and better.

877
01:10:04,126 --> 01:10:05,710
This is tricky.
Accelerate!

878
01:10:07,710 --> 01:10:08,793
Oh, damn!

879
01:10:14,585 --> 01:10:18,418
I lost them this time.
Now we're home and dry.

880
01:10:18,585 --> 01:10:20,668
What's that?

881
01:11:34,126 --> 01:11:36,835
A car!
Quick! Quick!

882
01:11:37,001 --> 01:11:39,710
I can't. I've had enough...

883
01:11:43,293 --> 01:11:44,335
Come on!

884
01:11:45,418 --> 01:11:48,043
Quick. Hurry! Go on!

885
01:11:55,543 --> 01:11:57,001
There are the others.

886
01:11:59,085 --> 01:12:01,001
Don't let them out of our sight.

887
01:12:02,501 --> 01:12:04,293
I saved your life.

888
01:12:04,460 --> 01:12:06,918
- The police couldn't catch you.
- Why?

889
01:12:07,085 --> 01:12:11,960
The others would have executed
the president, and you'd be dead.

890
01:12:12,126 --> 01:12:14,960
- So I saved your life.
- Thank you.

891
01:12:15,126 --> 01:12:16,710
Put your seat belt on.

892
01:12:21,043 --> 01:12:22,835
Watch out!

893
01:12:24,793 --> 01:12:26,626
Faster!

894
01:12:40,501 --> 01:12:41,626
There they are.

895
01:12:45,585 --> 01:12:47,626
We won't lose them now.

896
01:12:58,043 --> 01:12:59,335
Come on!

897
01:13:16,001 --> 01:13:19,251
- We're being followed!
- By whom?

898
01:13:19,418 --> 01:13:21,793
Who cares? Faster!

899
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:23,543
Come on, faster!

900
01:13:23,710 --> 01:13:25,085
Top speed.

901
01:13:27,918 --> 01:13:29,001
Come on!

902
01:13:34,210 --> 01:13:36,918
They must stop.
Shoot the tyres!

903
01:13:46,626 --> 01:13:49,543
Traitors! I'll have them shot!

904
01:13:49,710 --> 01:13:51,876
They're the ones shooting
at the moment.

905
01:14:08,876 --> 01:14:11,585
We'll get them in the valley.
Go!

906
01:14:19,251 --> 01:14:21,585
I think we've got them.

907
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:02,001
This is a better road.

908
01:16:09,876 --> 01:16:13,335
- We've given them the slip.
- You think?

909
01:16:22,668 --> 01:16:24,168
Don't move.

910
01:16:32,335 --> 01:16:34,376
Ah, Commissioner.

911
01:16:34,710 --> 01:16:37,251
What a nice surprise to see you here!

912
01:16:40,001 --> 01:16:41,960
Is it over? Is it over?

913
01:16:43,001 --> 01:16:46,918
- Is it over?
- Yes. If you come with me...

914
01:16:47,626 --> 01:16:50,376
Yes, Commissioner. I've had enough...

915
01:16:56,043 --> 01:16:58,543
If you didn't kidnap him
why did you want the ransom?

916
01:16:58,710 --> 01:17:00,918
- So the others wouldn't get it.
- Which others?

917
01:17:01,085 --> 01:17:03,168
The ones who kidnapped him.

918
01:17:03,335 --> 01:17:06,418
I don't know where the president is.
I didn't kidnap him.

919
01:17:06,585 --> 01:17:08,293
It wasn't me. That's all.

920
01:17:14,585 --> 01:17:16,710
- He's tough!
- What can we do?

921
01:17:16,876 --> 01:17:19,960
Take him by the finger
and turn like that.

922
01:17:20,126 --> 01:17:21,793
Give him to me!
I'll do it.

923
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:23,293
No! Not her! No!

924
01:17:23,460 --> 01:17:25,668
Do you want to find the president?

925
01:17:25,835 --> 01:17:30,793
In our country certain methods
are not permitted by law.

926
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:34,668
What was the point of having
a revolution?

927
01:17:40,001 --> 01:17:41,585
Commissioner...

928
01:17:44,001 --> 01:17:46,001
Can I have a word?

929
01:17:49,918 --> 01:17:52,460
It's getting late.

930
01:17:52,626 --> 01:17:53,876
Are you tired?

931
01:17:54,043 --> 01:17:56,376
I want to go.

932
01:17:57,335 --> 01:17:59,251
Can I take my coat?

933
01:17:59,418 --> 01:18:01,001
Will you see me out?

934
01:18:01,168 --> 01:18:04,835
- You're going at such a time?
- I'm rather tired.

935
01:18:05,001 --> 01:18:09,376
You won't see your restaurant
tonight... your president.

936
01:18:09,543 --> 01:18:14,043
The people's hero's life is at stake,
and you think of your bistro!

937
01:18:14,210 --> 01:18:17,668
It takes all sorts:
heroes and bistros.

938
01:18:18,085 --> 01:18:19,626
Greasy-spoon owner!

939
01:18:23,501 --> 01:18:25,876
I definitely prefer Scandinavians.

940
01:18:26,043 --> 01:18:28,710
She called me a greasy-spoon owner!

941
01:18:28,876 --> 01:18:30,918
It didn't go that badly.

942
01:18:31,085 --> 01:18:34,835
- I'm happy to have contributed...
- I renew my compliments.

943
01:18:35,001 --> 01:18:37,668
- Thank you, Commissioner.
- You first.

944
01:18:38,668 --> 01:18:41,043
Talking of compliments...

945
01:18:41,210 --> 01:18:44,210
You're going to have a word
with the minister.

946
01:18:44,376 --> 01:18:46,085
- Oh! The...?
- That's right.

947
01:18:46,251 --> 01:18:49,210
I'll bear it in mind.
What am I saying? We will.

948
01:18:49,376 --> 01:18:52,585
We'll talk about it over dinner
at your place.

949
01:18:52,751 --> 01:18:54,751
To mark the occasion,

950
01:18:54,918 --> 01:18:59,585
I'll do stuffed lamb's trotters
à la Septime!

951
01:19:01,001 --> 01:19:03,460
I guarantee he'll talk,
and fast!

952
01:19:07,001 --> 01:19:08,293
Gentlemen!

953
01:19:09,293 --> 01:19:11,168
Gentlemen, I salute you.

954
01:19:13,168 --> 01:19:15,543
Gentlemen, I salute you.

955
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:22,585
Now to Septime's!
"Very good, monsieur."

956
01:19:24,126 --> 01:19:26,668
"Here we are, monsieur."
"Thank you, Emile."

957
01:19:26,835 --> 01:19:30,210
"Hello, your Ladyship.
Hello, Minister."

958
01:19:30,376 --> 01:19:32,876
Hello, Mr Septime.

959
01:19:36,168 --> 01:19:38,418
"Hello, your Ladyship.
Hello, Minister."

960
01:19:38,585 --> 01:19:40,293
Hello, Mr Septime.

961
01:19:40,460 --> 01:19:42,293
Who's this?

962
01:19:42,460 --> 01:19:45,460
- We're going to take a little trip.
- Not again.

963
01:19:45,626 --> 01:19:49,085
In a plane. Yes, in a plane.

964
01:19:50,335 --> 01:19:52,335
That's enough!

965
01:19:52,501 --> 01:19:55,460
Follow my instructions.
Straight ahead.

966
01:19:55,626 --> 01:19:58,710
Turn left at the end of the avenue.

967
01:19:58,876 --> 01:20:00,751
Oh, not again!

968
01:20:00,918 --> 01:20:03,376
- Not again, surely?
- Go on!

969
01:20:05,751 --> 01:20:07,876
I've had enough. Enough!

970
01:20:37,293 --> 01:20:39,710
You're wasting your time, believe me.

971
01:20:39,876 --> 01:20:42,543
This case is closed.

972
01:20:42,710 --> 01:20:43,877
Not quite.

973
01:20:44,043 --> 01:20:46,751
What do you mean?
I don't understand.

974
01:20:46,918 --> 01:20:49,710
You'll understand... soon.

975
01:21:08,293 --> 01:21:10,835
Don't be afraid.
There's no danger.

976
01:21:11,001 --> 01:21:13,293
It'll all be fine, you'll see.

977
01:21:13,460 --> 01:21:15,418
I'll see, I'll see...

978
01:21:53,460 --> 01:21:54,418
Monsieur...

979
01:22:01,543 --> 01:22:03,793
Mr President!

980
01:22:06,710 --> 01:22:09,668
Mr Septime!
Glad to see you again.

981
01:22:09,835 --> 01:22:13,251
Me too!
You've not been mistreated?

982
01:22:13,418 --> 01:22:16,376
I've never been so happy
in my life.

983
01:22:16,543 --> 01:22:18,960
I'm finally free!

984
01:22:19,126 --> 01:22:20,751
I'm free!

985
01:22:20,918 --> 01:22:23,460
But you are a prisoner?

986
01:22:23,626 --> 01:22:27,501
- Only of myself.
- I don't understand.

987
01:22:27,668 --> 01:22:29,876
I must confess everything.

988
01:22:30,043 --> 01:22:32,668
- No one kidnapped me.
- What?

989
01:22:32,835 --> 01:22:35,168
- I kidnapped myself.
- What?

990
01:22:35,335 --> 01:22:37,585
Yes. All on my own.

991
01:22:38,210 --> 01:22:40,751
I organised my escape
to my retreat here.

992
01:22:40,918 --> 01:22:43,460
- It started at your restaurant.
- I know.

993
01:22:43,626 --> 01:22:47,626
Forgive me. I couldn't bear it.
I had to escape.

994
01:22:47,793 --> 01:22:50,460
You can't imagine
a statesman's life.

995
01:22:50,626 --> 01:22:54,418
Official chores,
protocol, hypocrisy...

996
01:22:54,585 --> 01:22:55,793
I'd had enough.

997
01:22:57,126 --> 01:23:00,418
You didn't think
of the trouble you'd cause me?

998
01:23:01,626 --> 01:23:05,293
I needed space, fresh air,

999
01:23:05,460 --> 01:23:09,418
freedom, fishing, bird song.

1000
01:23:09,585 --> 01:23:11,626
I've discovered nature.

1001
01:23:11,793 --> 01:23:14,751
And France!
France is beautiful!

1002
01:23:14,918 --> 01:23:18,876
Yes, it's very pretty,
but this isn't serious.

1003
01:23:19,043 --> 01:23:23,043
You should have thought
before taking power.

1004
01:23:23,210 --> 01:23:25,585
When you take power,
you have to keep it.

1005
01:23:25,751 --> 01:23:28,168
- If I'd known!
- It's too late now.

1006
01:23:28,335 --> 01:23:31,710
I run a restaurant.
I can't just desert.

1007
01:23:31,876 --> 01:23:35,043
Who said that was my intention?

1008
01:23:35,626 --> 01:23:37,710
This man was the pyramid.

1009
01:23:37,876 --> 01:23:40,543
He was the pyramid?

1010
01:23:41,668 --> 01:23:43,168
He's a real friend.

1011
01:23:43,335 --> 01:23:47,293
What about this woman who loves you,
your secretary?

1012
01:23:47,460 --> 01:23:49,210
- She's yours.
- I don't want her.

1013
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:50,835
- Me neither.
- What?

1014
01:23:51,001 --> 01:23:54,376
You can get sick of everything.
Even earthquakes.

1015
01:23:54,543 --> 01:23:57,293
It needs sorting out.
You can take her...

1016
01:23:57,460 --> 01:23:59,543
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

1017
01:23:59,710 --> 01:24:01,543
My holidays are over.

1018
01:24:01,710 --> 01:24:04,418
I owe you the finest days
of my life.

1019
01:24:04,585 --> 01:24:10,001
- I can't say the same.
- That's why you're here.

1020
01:24:10,168 --> 01:24:13,668
I decided to right
the wrongs I've done you.

1021
01:24:13,835 --> 01:24:17,460
- What?
- I'll make you a hero.

1022
01:24:18,460 --> 01:24:20,210
A hero!

1023
01:24:21,460 --> 01:24:25,210
THANKS TO HEROIC MR SEPTIME,
MISSING HEAD OF STATE IS FOUND

1024
01:24:25,376 --> 01:24:27,376
AND ESCAPES FROM HIS KIDNAPPERS

1025
01:25:26,085 --> 01:25:27,793
The president has disappeared!

1026
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:30,210
- What have you done?
- I don't know!

1027
01:25:30,376 --> 01:25:32,834
Not the pyramid again!

1028
01:25:33,001 --> 01:25:35,626
Find him or I'll throw you in jail!

1029
01:25:35,793 --> 01:25:37,251
What have you done...

1030
01:25:45,043 --> 01:25:46,626
Music, quick!

1031
01:25:48,001 --> 01:25:50,501
- I'd like to know...
- The anthem!

1032
01:25:53,460 --> 01:25:55,293
No, no, no.

1033
01:25:56,543 --> 01:25:57,585
No.

1034
01:26:50,043 --> 01:26:52,043
