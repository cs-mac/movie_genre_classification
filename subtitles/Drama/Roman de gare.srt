00:00:19,395 --> 00:00:25,797
About 140 years ago
in the turbulent Bakumatsu era...

2
00:00:27,499 --> 00:00:33,765
There was an assassin
called Hitokiri Battousai.

3
00:00:35,303 --> 00:00:37,890
Following orders of the
people of the anti-shogunate

4
00:00:37,903 --> 00:00:40,500
movement he was acting behind
the scenes in Kyoto...

5
00:00:40,553 --> 00:00:42,913
Being feared by many due
to his strength and

6
00:00:42,926 --> 00:00:45,296
cool-headedness even in
the fiercest of fights.

7
00:00:47,892 --> 00:00:54,781
It is now the crucial battle of
the Boshin Civil War...

8
00:01:15,295 --> 00:01:19,622
[January of 1868]

9
00:01:19,895 --> 00:01:27,895
[January of 1868]
[In the mountains of Toba-fushimi]

10
00:01:48,617 --> 00:01:51,588
It's them! Shinsengumi!

11
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,350
Hitokiri Battousai!

12
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,990
Where are you? Where?

13
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,910
Saito Hajime, Captain of the Third Unit
of the Shinsengumi! Brace yourself!

14
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,950
It's time for the duel, Battousai!

15
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,990
We won! It's the Imperial Standard!

16
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,070
Now you're just a rebel army!

17
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,550
It's the victory of the
Satsuma-Choushuu Alliance!

18
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,870
So it's come...

19
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,310
The new age.

20
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,470
At last.

21
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,990
Himura Battousai!

22
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,310
Don't think it's the end of it.

23
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,869
Even if the world changes...

24
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:59,530
We have no other path but to
live by the sword and die by the sword.

25
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,470
Why?

26
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,460
Why have I survived?

27
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,520
What's with this sword?

28
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,950
It belongs to Hitokiri Battousai...

[1878 - the 11th year of Meiji Era]
[Tokyo]

00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,750
Field marshal Yamagata Aritomo speaks!

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,030
Salute!

33
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,310
At ease!

34
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,230
10 years have passed
since the Revolution...

35
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:01,110
This country became unified!

36
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,040
It continues to develop using
the Western countries as a model.

37
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:13,240
Power of the new government
spread far and wide...

38
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:19,190
Bringing fortune and stability
to our country!

39
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:31,830
The age when fear and violence
were ruling came to the end!

40
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,310
Salute!

41
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,150
Humans are weak.

42
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,300
They long to talk about ideals...

43
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:59,190
But in the end three things make
them no better than animals...

44
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,350
Their well-being...

45
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,150
Money...

46
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,230
And pleasure.

47
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,900
Excuse me.

48
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:31,750
It's a success! You did well, Megumi.

49
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,150
Thank you.

50
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,190
This new sort of opium...

51
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,710
Turns human into a beast.

52
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,190
You may go.

53
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,430
One person who knows the way
of making is more than enough.

54

Which one should I choose? Says Kamisama...

55

Thank you so much!

56
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,830
Damn it!

57
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,110
Let's go!

58
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,870
Leave him alone.

59
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,510
This guy...

60
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,030
I'll leave him to Battousai.

61

Banzai! Banzai!

62
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,910
How about delicious yaki-dango?

63
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,910
I'll take one.

64
00:13:27,717 --> 00:13:28,990
Why don't you understand?

65
00:13:28,998 --> 00:13:30,638
That's why I told you not to come closer!

66
00:13:31,929 --> 00:13:34,065
Go away! There! Get it already!

It's the police officer who

70

It is a warning then.

Again Hitokiri Battousai... Why there
is always an assassin's vindication?

72
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,580
It's a fake.

73
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,430
What?

74
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,403
A "vindication of slaying
the evil" is a list

75
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:00,550
of all misdeeds the
killed person committed.

But there's none...

77
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,760
It's not the Battousai's way of doing.

Isn't it different form a usual sword?

You can't kill anyone with this.

101
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,790
Right?

102
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,780

this discription of a person...

always come in a bunch.

How about one?

113

Police officer who worked
undercover was killed.

The killer calls himself "Battousai".

This is the new age after all.

127

Don't get carried away.

128

This ghost of the samurai age seems to fail
to notice that the times have changed.

It's a meal!

130

Look at those people.

131
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,683
They all lost their livelihood
with coming of the Meiji era.

132
00:19:08,696 --> 00:19:11,190
Descendants of samurais,
samurais, ronins.

133
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,348
I couldn't remain indifferent looking at them.
So I hired them as my guards.

134
00:19:15,361 --> 00:19:19,360
It's for everyone's good
that I look after them.

135
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:23,130
As they're very capable, if you
just leave them alone who knows

136
00:19:23,143 --> 00:19:26,034
what they'll do. No one can predict
whom a hungry dog would bite.

137
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:37,550
Well, by looking at you I can tell
that you were a samurai as well.

138
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:38,750
And still am.

139
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,830
As expected, we won't get along.

140
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,350
Be careful.

141
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:47,230
Police is all about "evidence and proof"
but I'm not.

142
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,270
Kanryu-sama, Megumi has disappeared.

143
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,760
What'd you say? Megumi's run away?

144
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:12,070
We were informed by the bribed policeman.

145
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,390
He told that she came to the police alone.

146
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,270
Damn it, Megumi!

147
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:37,150
No need to worry, I'm tellin ya!

148
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:41,280
If she tells them about the opium
she'll be charged for making it as well.

149
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,110
You're so stupid!

150
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,750
Can you imagine what will happen
if she get desperate?

151
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,470
What do you know about women?

152
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,930
What?! What the hell!

153
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,750
Shut up!

154
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,790
Bring the woman back. Now!

155
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,660
Don't you touch me.

156
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,980
What did you say?

157
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,900
I'll search for her.

158
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,790
What?

159
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,310
Don't kill her, Jin'e.

160
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,630
She knows the secret of
manufacturing "a spider's web".

161
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:32,670
With others do whatever
you want, "Battousai".

162
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,030
Isn't it you who asked for our protection?

163
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,300
If you don't explain the situation to us...

164
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,510
Can't be helped then.

165
00:22:09,696 --> 00:22:10,676
What happened?

166
00:22:12,263 --> 00:22:12,903
It's over there!

167
00:22:13,111 --> 00:22:13,751
What's going on?

168
00:22:16,138 --> 00:22:17,179
This way!

169
00:22:17,334 --> 00:22:18,710
Get off the way!

170
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,460
Are you Battousai?
Quit your resistance!

171
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,750
What are you?

172
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,390
Don't move!

173
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,950
Stay where you are!

174
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,750
It's not a black magic.

175
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,940
It's Nikkaidou Heihou's "Shin no Ippou".

176
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,020
Human's heart is weak
being full of fears.

177
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,343
By striking this weakness
with strong spirit of

178
00:23:45,356 --> 00:23:47,950
the sword I paralize all
victim's movements.

179
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,620
Is it painful?

180
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,310
The weaker heart is
the easier to strike.

181
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,830
Ah, it's a kitten!

182
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,230
Cute!

183
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,980
What's...

184
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,870
Stop right there!

185
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,390
Are you that Battousai?

186
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,161
For what reason do you murder people...

187
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:41,060
Proclaiming yourself to be one
of Kamiya Kasshin Ryuu?

188
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,520
Because of a scum like you, my father...

189
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:59,540
Kamiya Kasshin Ryuu left by my father is...

190
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,430
You father is what?

191
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:14,720
He teached the sword which brings
men to life. Sword that is not for kill...

192
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:19,110
Not for murder...
But for bringing men to life!

193
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:27,470
Woman with a wooden sword
has the guts to face me.

194
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,510
Shut up!

195
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,790
What can you do with this stick?

196
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,790
Only after it tasted blood
sword comes to life...

197
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,920
You'll percieve it in the next world.

198
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,470
You forgot this.

199
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,990
What? Who are you?

200
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,110
It doesn't matter.

201
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:16,670
So it's you the man who
calls himself Battousai.

202
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,990
This scar...

203
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,030
This speed...

204
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,510
You must be the legendary...

205
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:46,430
It doesn't work on you...

206
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,870
Run!

207
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,150
This way!

208
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,709
Brace yourself, Battousai!

209
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:59,550
Seems like there was a point
surviving in this boring world after all.

210
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,660
Get the rope ready!

211
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,070
Are you alright?

212
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,220
He's there! Battousai's there!

213
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,710
Catch him!

214
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,220
This way.

215
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,510
No, this one.

216
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,270
Oro?!

217
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,750
I have to thank you...

218
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,750
But just so you know
I'd be fine even without your help.

219
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,740
It's better to treat your wounds right now.

220
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:29,950
Acting master Kamiya Kaoru...

221
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:35,150
It was never a big school...

222
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,310
But still, in respect of my father
who passed away...

223
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,990
Many people have been practicing here.

224
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:56,150
However, six months ago...

225
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,481
Because of the commotion Battousai
started it's became like this...

226
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:09,230
I need to stop his wrong-doings
as fast as possible. Otherwise...

227
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,030
You should give up on him.

228
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,310
What?

229
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:20,190
He is far stronger than you, Kaoru-dono.

230
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:26,190
A swordsman must be honest
about his foe's skill and his own.

231
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,990
You must have realised already,
what will happen next time you face him.

232
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,350
Dignity of your school...

233
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,870
Such a thing is not worth your life.

234
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,870
Sword is not a tool to kill people with...

235
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:06,190
Kamiya Kasshin Ryuu sees as ideal
the sword that brings men to life.

236
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,040
For the school to be stained by
a sword that kills is unthinkable.

237
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,100
But just a mere rurouni...

238
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,910
Can't understand this pain!

239
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,030
The sword that brings to life...

240
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,230
Well...

241
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,968
Whatever your reasons
might be, it's impossible

242
00:31:42,981 --> 00:31:44,680
to patrol at nights
with such a wound.

243
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,360
I'm sure your father
wouldn't wish his dauther...

244
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,420
To protect the name of the school...

245
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,630
With her own life.

246
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,780
Exuse me.

247
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,310
Such an awful murders!

248
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,350
Does he challenge us?

249
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,340
Rurouni?

250
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,910
Ah, it's just you...

251
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,710
What'd you mean "just me"?

252
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,070
Not satisfyed with Myoujin Yahiko-sama?

253
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,830
You're too noisy.

254
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,350
Where is my breakfast?

255
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:51,590
Be so kind to feed a poor starving child!

256
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,910
You're making too much noise.

257
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,750
Trainings first.

258
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,001
Kaoru: Start cleaning up already!
Yahiko: I don't want!

259
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,270
Who are you?

260
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,080
We come to get this dojo.
[He holds the dojo sign.]

261
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,550
What?

262
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,590
We'll give you a good price.

263
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,070
One noble man says he wants
to buy it for a lot of money.

264
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:34,590
For you... It's not a bad offer.

265
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,041
What are you talking about?

266
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,150
I'd never give away my father's
dojo just like that!

267
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,110
Hey, master!

268
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:45,100
You're quite a shameless woman, huh.

269
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,750
To talk like that after the cruel murderer
came right out of your school...

270
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,990
Battousai has nothing
to do with our school!

271
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,100
Don't get so worked up!

272
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,281
It seems noone comes near your dojo,
the dojo that trains murderers.

273
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,950
Do it, guys!

274
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,470
Stop!

275
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,620
Stop it!

276
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,470
What do you think you're doing?!

277
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,150
Yahiko!

278
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,310
What's with this brat?

279
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,858
I'm Myoujin Yahiko -
descendant of Tokyo samurais!

280
00:35:15,871 --> 00:35:18,300
And I won't forgive bastards
who bully the weak!

281
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,430
Let go of him!

282
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,990
What are you doing?!

283
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,950
Talk big after you got strong not before!

284
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,260
Exactly!

285
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:33,510
This school is said to teach
the sword that brings to life...

286
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:38,670
How about bring yourself to life
with that sword?

287
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,600
Don't walk into with your shoes on!

288
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,190
Sword that brings to life... So naive!

289
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,510
Remove your shoes! Put off your shoes!

290
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,670
Our goal is violence,
the essence of our art is to kill!

291
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,030
This is the true nature
of swordsmanship.

292
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,710
Get it!

293
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,550
Won't forgive!

294
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,540
Rurouni...

295
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,220
Out of the way!

296
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,180
Who're you?

297
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,590
You are right...

298
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,670
Her words are the words of a person...

299
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,550
Who never soiled one's
hands with a killing.

300
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,870
Sounds like childish nonsense.

301
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,390
A sword is a weapon.

302
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,070
Swordsmanship is an art of killing.

303
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:57,740
No matter what pretty words you use...

304
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,590
This is the truth that can not be changed.

305
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,920
But in the face of such awful truth...

306
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,150
I prefer the naive words of Kaoru-dono.

307
00:37:11,116 --> 00:37:12,145
Bullshit!

308
00:37:44,421 --> 00:37:47,360
Don't run, you! Go face him!

309
00:37:47,633 --> 00:37:50,366
Don't hide, you idiot!

310
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:52,621
I tell you to go and fight!

311
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:47,620
The style Hitokiri Battousai uses
is that of Hiten Mitsurugi Ryuu.

312
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:56,190
It's an ancient style
that pits one against many.

313
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,230
If not for this sword...

314
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,750
Many of you would be dead.

315
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,420
You bastard!

316
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,430
You are...

317
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,340
Kaoru-chan!

318
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,910
What've happened?!

319
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,390
He's dead!

320
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,270
What... What have happened here?

321
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,380
Is it him? He killed them?!

322
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,430
No, you're wrong.

323
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,590
They suddenly came to attack the dojo.

324
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,940
But it's okay.

325
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,750
No one has been killed,
they are just unconscious.

326
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,590
This way, this way!

327
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,790
What happened?

328
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,240
You what, haven't heard about
the law? No swords are allowed!

329
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,150
Bring them all in!

330
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,470
What happened here?

331
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,790
I'm afraid it's all my fault...

332
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,270
I'm rurouni and I'm to
blame for all of this...

333
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,470
It has nothing to do with this dojo.

334
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,460
Let's go!

335
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,500
Wait!

336
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,630
Rurouni-san...

337
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,350
What is it?

338
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,820
At least tell me your name!

339
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:16,670
Ororo!

340
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,980
Wait a second!

341
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,350
It is Himura Kenshin.

342
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:25,790
Off the way!

343
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,870
Kenshin...

344
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,350
The heart of sword...

345
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,750
Quiet!

346
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,550
Newcomer's here!

347
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,020
Move your legs!

348
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:53,740
Open the door!

349
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,240
A man with the scar
in a shape of character "ten".

350
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,790
Just as I thought, it's you.

351
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,470
Long time no see...

352
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,590
Hitokiri Battousai.

353
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:33,850
It's been almost ten years
since the Battle of Toba-fushimi.

354
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,460
I need to talk to you.

355
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,100
Come out.

356
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,040
Hitokiri Battousai, huh.

357
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:39,870
It's sure have been a while!
Where you have been hiding all this time?

358
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,070
Yamagata-san?

359
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,183
There've been rumors that
last ten years extremely

360
00:44:48,196 --> 00:44:49,870
skilled rurouni has been
helping people around.

361
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:55,550
I ordered my men to investigate it.

362
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,060
What?

363
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:02,950
Ah, this guy?

364
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:08,070
In the past we followed different paths.

365
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:12,750
But both of us wanted
the same - the better country.

366
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:21,910
Now he is called Fujita Goro.
He works for me.

367
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,590
What do you want from me?

368
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,430
There is a bunch that sells it openly.

369
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,750
Goes by name "spider's web".

370
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:39,270
Outside it looks like normal opium
but content is absolutely different.

371
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,590
Makes people heavely addicted.

372
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,950
Opium will ruin the country.

373
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:50,790
Even the greatest Qing dynasty
couldn't do anything...

374
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,070
And the part of its territories
became a British colony.

375
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,270
I'm only a rurouni.

376
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,750
Why explain it all to me?

377
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,150
No doubt...

378
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:07,790
They are planning something bigger.

379
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,150
Help me...

380
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,470
Get a position in the military service...

381
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:34,639
And use these hands once
more for the sake of...

382
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:37,930
I don't feel like working
as hitokiri ever again.

383
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,990
"Hitokiri", huh?

384
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:53,710
It all was for the sake of Revolution!

385
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,720
Have you lost all strength of yours?

386
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:01,230
Why use such a ridiculous sword?

387
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:08,510
How are you going to protect anybody,
a hitokiri who doesn't kill?

388
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,870
Even with this sword...

389
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,830
I can protect the people within my sight.

390
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,190
Want to try it?

391
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:25,390
Before talking big how about
protect at least yourself?

392
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:44,659
I won't draw my sword.

393
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:45,700
As if I care!

394
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,590
Sword with a blade put upside down...

395
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:28,070
Will hurt you in the end.

396
00:48:34,670 --> 00:48:36,230
Just like this.

397
00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:41,800
Have you remembered that time?

398
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:48,150
As I threw my past away...

399
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,110
I don't kill people anymore!

400
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,150
That's enough!

401
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,710
I'm sorry for that.

402
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:31,830
It's nothing.

403
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,150
Release him.

404
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:00,350
Hey, Kaoru?

405
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:33,990
Kaoru!

406
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:34,870
Oh!

407
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:41,590
Sorry! Are you okay?

408
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:44,230
Help me, please!

409
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,590
I'm being chased!

410
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:49,060
I beg you.

411
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:00,300
Kaoru-dono...

412
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,510
You have nowhere to go, right?

413
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:33,870
Come to my place.

414
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,350
Because you saved me.

415
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:46,070
You must have already realised...

416
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,229
That I was a hitokiri.

417
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:49,950
I don't care!

418
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,270
The person I met...

419
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:01,110
Was a rurouni called Kenshin.

420
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:06,590
We all have things in our past
we don't want to talk about.

421
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:10,710
Right?

422
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:15,110
Here you are.

423
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:18,270
Take it!

424
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:24,270
Let's go!

425
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:32,550
Come on.

426
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:35,630
Let's go!

427
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,230
Come inside.

428
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:50,910
Exuse me for intruding.

429
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:56,270
Yahiko.

430
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:02,910
This is Myoujin Yahiko.
I teach him sword from time to time...

431
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,200
And he lives there most of the time.

432
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:09,510
She has no students at all
so I kindly come to visit.

433
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:12,110
He is rude but kind inside.

434
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:14,430
Shut up! I just want to become strong!

435
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:15,950
As you wish.

436
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:18,390
Kenshin will live here too from now on.

437
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:21,110
I'm your sempai then!

438
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:25,110
Take good care of me.

439
00:53:26,106 --> 00:53:27,307
O..ok.

440
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:32,030
Introduce him to me too.

441
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:38,660
What? Who are you?!

442
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,641
She was soaking wet so I decided
to let her take the bath at least.

443
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:43,329
And you decided it all by yourself?

444
00:53:43,330 --> 00:53:45,990
Who is that gentlmen?

445
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:51,350
W..wait!

446
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,150
This is rurouni, he's name is Kenshin.

447
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:59,990
Oh, so it's you!

448
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,280
I heard about you from the boy.

449
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:06,790
I'm Takani Megumi.
Nice to meet you!

450
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:09,830
Nice to meet you.

451
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,430
It's better to have
a change of clothes, right?

452
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,350
Much obliged.

453
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,230
Father was a big man...

454
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:45,870
Only his clothes from when
he was young will fit you.

455
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:47,780
Color...

456
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,350
Color may be a little bit flashy for you...

457
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,710
No, it's alright.

458
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:49,510
Sword that brings to life...

459
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,470
Welcome!

460
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:06,390
By the way...

461
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:10,070
Why are you even here?

462
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:14,870
Oh, looks like someone is jealous!

463
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:18,670
You are not from here, are you?

464
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:21,310
Where do you live? Where are you from?

465
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:22,460
Secret!

466
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:24,710
Mysterious woman is beautiful, isn't she?

467
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,350
Enough of this talk.

468
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:29,910
Here you are.

469
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:32,110
Thank you.

470
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:39,630
It's in a sign of my gratitude. So don't
be shy and eat as much as you want.

471
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:42,990
Then...

472
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:48,830
Delicious.

473
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:50,390
Right?

474
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:51,790
So hot!

475
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:53,990
Eat carefully!

476
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:55,340
I know!

477
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:56,860
Kaoru-chan...

478
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:00,400
I heard about what happened in the dojo.

479
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:01,540
Tae-san...

480
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:04,270
Don't give up.

481
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:05,830
We all decided...

482
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,590
That we won't sell our places
no matter what.

483
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:10,670
Welcome!

484
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:14,270
Welcome!

485
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,230
Ah, that's Takeda Kanryu!

486
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:21,880
He is a businessman who has
a mansion on the outskirts of town.

487
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:24,470
Where is the bathroom?

488
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:25,910
That way.

489
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:35,910
Kanryu-sama!

490
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:43,870
Excuse me for interrupting your dinner...

491
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:51,670
Is it you that brave man who alone
protected the dojo from ten thugs?

492
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:58,910
I am trading foreign goods.

493
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:03,430
Hey.

494
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:07,140
Let's go straight to the point.

495
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:11,270
I want to employ you with this money.

496
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:16,470
If you work for ten people you'll get
a payment tenth times bigger.

497
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:19,830
How about that?
Will you become our bodyguard?

498
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:23,390
I decline your offer.

499
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:33,990
Is this not enough?

500
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,310
I got it.

501
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:42,150
Eagles eat no flies, is that it?

502
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:44,270
Well, I don't mind.

503
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:50,350
However, in the Meiji era
money is everything.

504
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:54,310
Sorry to tell you that,
but now your pride is worthless.

505
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:56,046
Moreover, samurais who
continue to hold onto it...

506
00:58:56,286 --> 00:58:58,150
Are falling low one after another.

507
00:58:58,280 --> 00:58:59,790
As a result, nowadays
red-light districts...

508
00:58:59,961 --> 00:59:02,141
Are full of wifes and
daughters of ex-samurais.

509
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:05,430
Look at the members of gangs...

510
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:10,270
All of them are samurais who broke down.
That's the world we live in now.

511
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:16,470
Forget about your samurai's past.

512
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:20,670
And start to learn...

513
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,310
How to enjoy...

514
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:24,780
Your life.

515
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:32,750
Exuse me.

516
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:50,990
No money, no hot pot.

517
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:54,910
I'll get that money then!

518
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:56,350
Sanosuke-san?

519
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:57,710
W-wait!

520
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,470
Hire me!

521
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:07,700
Who are you?

522
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:12,830
I'm fight merchant Sagara Sanousuke!

523
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:15,870
Just out of jail.
Have nothing to do.

524
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:18,460
Are you good enough...

525
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:21,030
For such a sum?

526
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:26,500
Want to try me out,
legendary hitokiri...

527
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,830
Himura Battousai-san!

528
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:30,390
What?!

529
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,710
If I beat him will you employ me?

530
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:45,510
We disturb people here.

531
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:48,540
May we go outside?

532
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:53,670
I've been waiting for it!

533
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:55,120
All go outside!

534
01:00:55,210 --> 01:00:56,910
It's a fight!

535
01:00:58,920 --> 01:00:59,950
This is a sword...

536
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:04,470
To cut riders with horses.
It's called zanbatou.

537
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:07,440
Was popular during the Ounin War.

538
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:17,790
Haven't been using it for ages,
so it's not sharp at all.

539
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:18,790
Still...

540
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:27,590
I can smash you down with it.

541
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:40,230
Wait!

542
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:50,630
Himura Battousai!

543
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:54,081
Warrior of Revolution
from Choushuu province!

544
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:58,260
Worked as hitokiri for 5 years,
since he was 14 years old.

545
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:06,390
But for the last 10 years
no one has seen you.

546
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:22,190
That was good!

547
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:23,750
Off the way!

548
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:26,460
Off the way!

549
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:39,670
I put my sword away.

550
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:46,150
Then bring it back and fight me!

551
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:50,660
I don't want to fight you.

552
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:51,750
Why is that?!

553
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:59,150
There is no reason for us to fight.

554
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:10,070
That man...

555
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:13,430
Are you going to use your talent for him?

556
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:23,390
What's happening?

557
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:26,590
What's wrong?

558
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:29,230
What are you doing, fight merchant?

559
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:31,150
Kill him already!

560
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:33,550
Shut up!

561
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:36,510
Don't you tell me how to fight!

562
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:37,630
Is it the end?

563
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:52,180
Well, let it be it then.

564
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:56,230
Don't want to end up in jail again.

565
01:03:58,240 --> 01:03:59,910
Looks like I made some noise!

566
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:01,950
Go back, all of you!

567
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:03,590
It was just for show!

568
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:07,750
It's the end!

569
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:09,110
Let's go home.

570
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:13,870
Sorry for causing trouble.

571
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:19,590
Let's go back and eat.

572
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:21,870
Would be a waste not to eat it all.

573
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:24,910
He is the real thing.

574
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:28,710
Be careful with him.

575
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:39,630
We shouldn't make Battousai angry.

576
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:41,860
Got it!

577
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:52,790
Not enough blood!

578
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:59,350
Still not enough blood!

579
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:04,100
This is my way of doing!

580

It is me who is real Hitokiri Battousai!

Again work of fake Battousai...

582
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:31,150
Killed them, killed the police officers.
Who's side he is on.

583
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:36,830
Once you lose your humanity,
you can't go back.

584
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:41,030
Only then one can be called "hitokiri".

585
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:48,070
Please, go ahead.

586
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:49,110

587
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:51,030
Let's go.

588
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:52,030
Wait!

589
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:54,220
I got it!

590
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:02,190
Those are guys who attacked the dojo.

591
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:05,920
Result would be the same
if you just killed them at the time.

592
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:10,630
But if you did it then...

593
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:14,550
Those police officers would still be alive.

594
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:19,590
Even your sakabato...

595
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,070
Can be useful.

596
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:31,870
Off the way!

597
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:33,390
Let me see!

Be called the murder for the new age?

01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:39,670
If I continue to practice with
such a weakling I'll lose my skill.

664
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:41,430
It's my line!

665
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:43,750
Kaoru-dono, Yahiko, both of you...

666
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:45,790
Let's just eat!

667
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:48,870
Kaoru-chan!

668
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:51,710
Is anybody here?

669
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:53,030
Kaoru-chan!

670
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:54,630
I need your help!

671
01:19:57,760 --> 01:20:00,550
Her body suddenly became numb...

672
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:03,520
Breathing got harsh and then...

673
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:05,070
Have you seen the doctor?

674
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:10,460
No, since the last night all doctors
from the area have disappeared!

675
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:18,190
We don't know what to do anymore!

676
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:19,230
Hey!

677
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:38,060
Be careful.

678
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:45,070
I'll get this dojo!

679
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:52,969
Kaoru-chan! Kaoru-chan!

680
01:20:52,970 --> 01:20:53,790
Help us!

681
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:55,430
Kaoru-chan!

682
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:56,990
Help!

683
01:20:57,160 --> 01:20:58,110
What's happened?

684
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:03,950
She's been telling since morning
that her belly hurts.

685
01:21:04,040 --> 01:21:05,310
She collapsed...

686
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:12,190
This way?

687
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:17,100
What's happening?

688
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:21,070
Is it a virus?

689
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:23,790
Hey!

690
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:25,910
Somebody, call a doctor!

691
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,801
If you need a doctor,
there is one right here.

692
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:36,590
High temperature and coma...

693
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:41,150
Most probably caused by poison.

694
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:42,470
What?

695
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:44,150
Poison? Are you sure?

696
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:47,040
We must get the poison out fast!
And water, I need water!

697
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:48,710
But not from the well!

698
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:50,960
There's a high chance that
wells were poisoned. What?

699
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:55,230
Come to the drug store,
buy some castor oil.

700
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:57,230
I also need a towel and a kettle.

701
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:58,030
And you!

702
01:21:58,160 --> 01:22:00,910
You go buy as much water as possible.

703
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:03,990
Kaoru-san, can we get any
Chinese medicine in the town?

704
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:08,321
I'll write you the list,
go and bring it all!

705
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:14,430
We are dealing with a poison!
Time is everything! Quickly!

706
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:16,670
Got it! Yes!

707
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:31,350
I brought water! Who needs water?

708
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:39,350
It'll heal you.

709
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:00,630
You'll get better.

710
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:34,750
I won't forgive.

711
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,790
How dare he treat person's life like this?

712
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:48,270
Megumi-dono.

713
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:53,430
Wouldn't you tell me the truth at last?

714
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:00,960
You said "Takani-san"?

715
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:02,830
You mean Megumi-san?

716
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:03,990
You know her?

717
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:05,790
Know? There is no one
in the world of medicine...

718
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:10,550
Who doesn't know name "Takani"!

719
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:14,281
Takani Clan is a famous family...

720
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:18,070
That has been healing
people for many years...

721
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:21,790
However, during the Aizu War...

722
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:26,470
They all went to the front
and were killed in a battle.

723
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:29,670
Is it so?

724
01:24:30,360 --> 01:24:32,390
Only one daugther stayed alive.

725
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:45,750
You were a hitokiri, weren't you?

726
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:53,030
How about to tell me about yourself...

727
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:57,750
Before asking me.

728
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:15,430
You must have killed many people
with those hands of yours.

729
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:21,870
And this scar?

730
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:25,030
To boast around?

731
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:28,550
Decoration of some kind?

732
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:39,150
This scar...

733
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,590
It was left by one young samurai...

734
01:25:53,240 --> 01:25:55,070
While this one...

735
01:25:59,480 --> 01:26:03,430
Was left by the woman who
was going to be his wife.

736
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:12,630
Countless lifes...

737
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:17,030
I took countless lifes.

738
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:19,070
I'm different from you.

739
01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:25,420
I've no family. No relatives to rely on...

740
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:33,110
Kanryu found me...

741
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:39,630
And I've become his woman.

742
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:53,430
We just used each other...

743
01:26:58,600 --> 01:27:02,950
He used me to get money
for the opium while I used him...

744
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:10,270
To survive.

745
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,590
To survive...

746
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:35,510
Give me some opium! Please!

747
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:37,270
Shut up!

748
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:40,660
Shut up!

749
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,910
Kanryu has over 250 guards...

750
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:01,510
And among them some are skilled samurais...

751
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:04,190
Who lost everything in the revolution.

752
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:10,910
I'll go with you.

753
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:19,030
Kenshin!

754
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:22,590
Kenshin, this...

755
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:24,670
Megumi-san has left.

756
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:33,020
It can't be.

757
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:06,180
I'll go too!

758
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:10,030
No.

759
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:16,310
The only master of
Kamiya Kasshin Ryuu must be safe.

760
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:20,030
But... It'll probably
take all night...

761
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:24,630
So prepare breakfast for
five people and a hot bath!

762
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:26,180
I'll go too!

763
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:27,870
Yahiko!

764
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,910
Even if you go, you'll
just be a hindrance.

765
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:34,630
Shut up!

766
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:35,670
Yahiko!

767
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:42,590
You'll stay at the dojo.

768
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:43,990
What?

769
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:50,350
I entrust Kaoru-dono and the dojo to you.

770
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:40,750
Of course...

771
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:44,700
I knew you'd come back.

772
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:47,710
You have nowhere to go...

773
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:52,110
But here.

774
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:55,870
From tomorrow you'll work hard...

775
01:31:55,960 --> 01:31:57,670
I came back...

776
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:02,910
Not to make more opium...

777
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:04,750
What?

778
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:07,110
I came back to kill you!

779
01:32:12,120 --> 01:32:13,590
Calm down...

780
01:32:14,040 --> 01:32:16,310
We have the same fate...

781
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:19,390
I'll kill myself right after!

782
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:21,270
You morons, stop staring
and do something!

783
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:22,830
Stop being foolish!

784
01:32:23,160 --> 01:32:24,510
It's my atonement!

785
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:32,700
You!

786
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:36,350
Ungrateful bitch!

787
01:32:51,880 --> 01:32:53,510
Finally there...

788
01:33:02,840 --> 01:33:04,470
It's him.

789
01:33:15,720 --> 01:33:17,190
Takeda Kanryu!

790
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:27,950
Hey you! I'll beat the shit
out of you for free!

791
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:29,910
Come here right now!

792
01:34:31,080 --> 01:34:32,590
Himura Battousai!

793
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:36,340
Megumi-dono!

794
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:40,510
Dare to break into others' house!

795
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:42,750
What a scum!

796
01:34:42,920 --> 01:34:44,710
What're you talking about?!

797
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:46,990
Don't hold yourself!

798
01:34:47,680 --> 01:34:48,550
Kill them!

799
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:52,670
Kill them right now!

800
01:35:01,480 --> 01:35:05,100
Do it! I have money for all!

801
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:08,990
Look! It's the money!

802
01:35:11,120 --> 01:35:14,590
I'll pay as much as you
want for their heads!

803
01:35:24,120 --> 01:35:25,430
Kill them!

804
01:35:39,560 --> 01:35:42,630
I don't get it!

805
01:35:43,120 --> 01:35:48,630
Why? Why Battousai is doing it?
For what?

806
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:53,470
If he was a man who wants money or fame, he
could have been in the military top by now.

807
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:57,830
Warriors of the Revolution
are all like this.

808
01:36:00,760 --> 01:36:01,980
What a clever dick!

809
01:36:06,120 --> 01:36:07,670
Get it ready!

810
01:36:09,120 --> 01:36:10,470
You mean "that" thing? But...

811
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:11,910
Don't you talk back!

812
01:36:12,040 --> 01:36:15,430
It's an iron rule of the business!
Be double sure!

813
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:20,430
Bring the woman!

814
01:36:52,760 --> 01:36:55,140
Can I ask you a favour?

815
01:37:47,240 --> 01:37:49,030
Where that crazy glassess-guy went?

816
01:37:49,160 --> 01:37:50,630
Probably upstairs...

817
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:00,670
Who's among you morons my opponent?

818
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:13,990
I'll be the one for you!

819
01:38:26,120 --> 01:38:29,900
Hand to hand!
Time for fight merchants has come!

820
01:38:30,360 --> 01:38:31,310
Go ahead!

821
01:38:31,640 --> 01:38:32,830
Much obliged.

822
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:50,990
So you're the Battousai...

823
01:38:55,320 --> 01:38:56,830
Where is Megumi-dono?

824
01:38:58,160 --> 01:39:01,470
Is that woman even worth saving?

825
01:39:02,160 --> 01:39:04,790
There is not a single person
not worth saving.

826
01:39:05,120 --> 01:39:06,990
What a nice logic.

827
01:39:08,120 --> 01:39:09,150
You tell me.

828
01:39:10,200 --> 01:39:12,500
Why did you sell your soul to Kanryu?

829
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:16,100
Soul?

830
01:39:16,640 --> 01:39:20,180
You also once belonged
to a samurai clan, did you not?

831
01:39:24,520 --> 01:39:26,630
Stop talking nonsense.

832
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:46,670
Because I couldn't feed myself...

833
01:39:48,040 --> 01:39:51,390
In that peaceful era you created.

834
01:40:32,200 --> 01:40:33,950
Kenshin! Are you ok?

835
01:40:55,400 --> 01:40:56,070
Die!

836
01:41:25,680 --> 01:41:27,390
What's with this sword?

837
01:41:34,640 --> 01:41:36,040
It's my vow not to kill ever again.

838
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:38,790
Sakabato.

839
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:53,630
Where do you think you're going?!

840
01:42:17,160 --> 01:42:19,990
Wait a second! Wait!

841
01:42:21,680 --> 01:42:22,870
What for?

842
01:42:31,200 --> 01:42:33,190
Want to try it too? It's good!

843
01:42:33,320 --> 01:42:34,190
Here!

844
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:42,350
I'm a vegetarian. Poor thing.

845
01:42:45,880 --> 01:42:47,020
Drink it then?

846
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:48,860
Give it to me.

847
01:43:25,730 --> 01:43:29,340
After killing so many people
it's too late for sakabato!

848
01:43:29,720 --> 01:43:30,750
Cut the bullshit!

849
01:44:08,280 --> 01:44:10,110
Fight is done!

850
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:13,100
By head!

851
01:44:22,080 --> 01:44:23,350
It was fun!

852
01:44:54,440 --> 01:44:57,030
Finally got serious...

853
01:45:20,720 --> 01:45:23,070
What is the vow not to kill?!

854
01:45:24,200 --> 01:45:27,030
You think you'll end this
fight without killing?

855
01:45:28,040 --> 01:45:29,180
I will.

856
01:45:29,680 --> 01:45:30,900
Come and try!

857
01:46:12,760 --> 01:46:14,550
You've done him pretty hard.

858
01:46:17,280 --> 01:46:19,070
Let's go.

859
01:46:20,560 --> 01:46:21,590
Wait...

860
01:46:24,240 --> 01:46:26,590
It's not the end of our battle yet!

861
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:29,110
Fight!

862
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:33,070
It is the end of it.

863
01:47:08,320 --> 01:47:10,030
Too much fun!

864
01:47:14,440 --> 01:47:15,390
Fire!

865
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:17,540
Sanosuke!

866
01:47:24,360 --> 01:47:27,750
You'll let me smoke my cigar
slowly, will you not?

867
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:31,500
Huh? Look at what you've
done to others' home!

868
01:47:31,640 --> 01:47:32,509
Bastards!

869
01:47:32,510 --> 01:47:34,150
It's you who've done it all, idiot!!

870
01:47:34,240 --> 01:47:36,350
Where is the legendary hitokiri?!

871
01:47:36,600 --> 01:47:38,190
Don't understimate me!

872
01:47:39,320 --> 01:47:41,350
I'll help you kill him.

873
01:47:42,320 --> 01:47:44,110
Why are you here?

874
01:47:44,560 --> 01:47:47,510
The brat from your place
came to the police.

875
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:49,110
Yahiko?

876
01:47:52,040 --> 01:47:53,150
What've happened?

877
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:54,470
Look...

878
01:47:57,360 --> 01:48:00,190
If this monstrous canon aims at one side...

879
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:02,830
Other side becomes a blind spot.

880
01:48:03,520 --> 01:48:05,190
Come at me!

881
01:48:05,320 --> 01:48:08,030
Welcome, welcome!

882
01:48:08,680 --> 01:48:09,710
Come on!

883
01:48:10,680 --> 01:48:11,550
I give up!

884
01:48:12,680 --> 01:48:14,030
You won!

885
01:48:14,360 --> 01:48:17,070
Don't shoot, don't shoot!

886
01:48:18,520 --> 01:48:21,030
There's no way we could
defeat such a thing.

887
01:48:21,360 --> 01:48:22,710
Right, Kenshin?

888
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:27,380
You come too, we can't win.

889
01:48:34,040 --> 01:48:35,550
I surrender.

890
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:45,590
Put off your sword!

891
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:09,110
Apologize to me!

892
01:49:09,560 --> 01:49:11,590
Cast yourself at my feet!

893
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:16,580
And put off your clothes!
Get naked!

894
01:49:16,760 --> 01:49:19,790
Apologize on your knees, naked!

895
01:49:23,320 --> 01:49:24,790
Don't get carried away!

896
01:49:27,760 --> 01:49:29,270
Damn you!

897
01:49:36,440 --> 01:49:37,420
This way! Shoot!

898
01:49:37,600 --> 01:49:38,790
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!

899
01:49:40,760 --> 01:49:42,590
More! More!

900
01:50:02,920 --> 01:50:04,510
Damn!

901
01:50:17,680 --> 01:50:21,460
Do you see now
what thing money can't buy?

902
01:50:31,280 --> 01:50:33,660
You're the one begging now...

903
01:50:41,880 --> 01:50:43,150
It's a life.

904
01:50:46,680 --> 01:50:47,820
Quit it!

905
01:50:54,400 --> 01:50:58,020
That means now I finally
can beat the shit out of you.

906
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:04,830
It's my work from now on. Go!

907
01:51:08,760 --> 01:51:09,870
Much obliged.

908
01:51:27,400 --> 01:51:28,350
Megumi-dono!

909
01:51:31,400 --> 01:51:32,870
Sorry for making you wait.

910
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:34,590
It's all right now.

911
01:51:35,400 --> 01:51:37,150
Thank God you're safe.

912
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:41,710
Don't waste your time!
Kaoru-san's in trouble!

913
01:52:07,960 --> 01:52:09,950
Looks like you're back to your senses.

914
01:52:17,160 --> 01:52:19,350
Don't look at me like that.

915
01:52:20,520 --> 01:52:23,950
I took you as hostage
because it'll enrage Battousai.

916
01:52:24,760 --> 01:52:29,470
Rage will bring more rage and
he'll be back to Hitokiri he once was.

917
01:52:40,200 --> 01:52:42,470
Looks like he'll be here soon.

918
01:52:55,720 --> 01:52:56,700
Kenshin!

919
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:13,510
You are angry.

920
01:53:14,960 --> 01:53:17,830
Yes, at you bastard who
involved Kaoru-dono.

921
01:53:19,720 --> 01:53:23,340
And at myself who couldn't prevent it.

922
01:53:24,720 --> 01:53:25,830
Kenshin?

923
01:53:33,640 --> 01:53:35,710
That's good, Battousai

924
01:53:36,960 --> 01:53:38,830
Get angry more!

925
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:42,140
Kaoru-dono!

926
01:54:08,840 --> 01:54:10,950
Think you can kill me with such a sword?

927
01:54:45,240 --> 01:54:46,220
Kenshin!

928
01:54:48,680 --> 01:54:51,090
You read my moves well...
Untill my "backwards wheel"!

929
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:20,950
Kenshin!

930
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:28,190
Not yet!

931
01:55:32,120 --> 01:55:37,030
You aren't the Battousai yet.
Not nearly.

932
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:51,110
Kaoru-dono!

933
01:55:51,280 --> 01:55:56,790
I made Shin no Ippou stronger than usual.
Enough to stop her lungs.

934
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:03,800
She will last two minutes at most.

935
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:12,060
Jin'e!

936
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:14,310
You've no time to talk.

937
01:56:15,800 --> 01:56:17,950
If you've something to say,
speak with that sword!

938
01:56:25,320 --> 01:56:26,790
Very good!

939
01:56:28,640 --> 01:56:30,630
If you do want to live...

940
01:56:31,280 --> 01:56:33,710
Break the spell you put on Kaoru-dono!

941
01:56:34,040 --> 01:56:36,030
I can't anymore.

942
01:56:37,680 --> 01:56:39,980
There's only two ways...

943
01:56:40,360 --> 01:56:42,190
She must either break it herself or...

944
01:56:43,680 --> 01:56:45,670
My will must be shattered...

945
01:56:47,800 --> 01:56:49,790
With my death.

946
01:56:53,720 --> 01:56:54,700
Then...

947
01:57:46,760 --> 01:57:50,910
It's time for our duel,
Himura Battousai

948
01:58:08,760 --> 01:58:10,270
No more games.

949
01:58:17,440 --> 01:58:20,310
Strike so that I can kill you.

950
01:58:47,630 --> 01:58:50,300
Take this!

951
01:59:28,040 --> 01:59:31,030
The stance of Battoujutsu, huh.

952
01:59:57,360 --> 02:00:01,870
Hiten Mitsurugi Ryuu,
battoujutsu "Souryuusen".

953
02:00:04,400 --> 02:00:07,230
I crushed your elbow
and severed your ligaments.

954
02:00:08,080 --> 02:00:11,190
Your life as swordsmen is over...

955
02:00:14,880 --> 02:00:15,910
And this...

956
02:00:19,560 --> 02:00:21,390
Is the end of your life.

957
02:00:29,920 --> 02:00:31,830
To save Kaoru-dono...

958
02:00:35,200 --> 02:00:37,550
I will once again become the hitokiri.

959
02:00:41,080 --> 02:00:42,430
Kill me!

960
02:00:43,440 --> 02:00:44,270
Die!

961
02:00:45,560 --> 02:00:47,110
Kenshin, no!

962
02:00:59,400 --> 02:01:01,350
She broke the spell!

963
02:01:03,240 --> 02:01:04,460
Kaoru-dono.

964
02:01:07,040 --> 02:01:10,580
Don't become hitokiri!

965
02:01:14,320 --> 02:01:16,620
You mustn't kill.

966
02:01:21,320 --> 02:01:22,630
Don't kill him...

967
02:01:24,440 --> 02:01:25,470
Kenshin...

968
02:01:30,160 --> 02:01:31,220
You...

969
02:01:35,560 --> 02:01:38,310
For the sake of people you killed...

970
02:01:42,680 --> 02:01:43,950
You...

971
02:01:47,360 --> 02:01:48,500
Until now...

972
02:01:50,480 --> 02:01:52,590
For the sake of people you saved...

973
02:01:57,920 --> 02:01:59,590
Now people can be saved...

974
02:02:04,160 --> 02:02:07,310
Cause now is...

975
02:02:09,360 --> 02:02:10,340
Now is the new age...

976
02:02:15,440 --> 02:02:16,470
Which...

977
02:02:20,720 --> 02:02:26,510
Which was created by you, Kenshin!

978
02:02:42,640 --> 02:02:44,030
Kaoru-dono...

979
02:02:49,400 --> 02:02:55,230
We must end it, Battousai.

980
02:03:00,360 --> 02:03:01,580
That's enough.

981
02:03:02,600 --> 02:03:05,710
You can't win with only left hand.

982
02:03:09,240 --> 02:03:11,430
It's not the end yet.

983
02:03:22,720 --> 02:03:25,750
Inside you're the hitokiri as well.

984
02:03:26,440 --> 02:03:29,980
I'm the hitokiri myself, I can tell...

985
02:03:32,080 --> 02:03:34,540
No matter what hitokiri is hitokiri.

986
02:03:37,080 --> 02:03:41,190
You won't be able to pretend
to be just a rurouni forever.

987
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,670
I'll wait for you in the hell.

988
02:04:43,640 --> 02:04:44,830
Do you get it now?

989
02:04:46,360 --> 02:04:49,830
What happens when you
go around talking about "justice"...

990
02:04:50,760 --> 02:04:52,640
Pretending to be a rurouni
who would not kill...

991
02:04:57,000 --> 02:05:00,190
When someone is killed, hatred is born...

992
02:05:01,680 --> 02:05:03,980
The hatred brings another murder...

993
02:05:05,840 --> 02:05:08,190
To break this chain...

994
02:05:09,880 --> 02:05:13,310
Is a purpose of this sword
which does not kill.

995
02:05:17,840 --> 02:05:20,400
How long are going to say these
fine but empty words?

996
02:05:32,720 --> 02:05:34,510
Going to wander again?

997
02:05:38,080 --> 02:05:40,910
The way of rurouni is
the way of weaklings.

998
02:05:47,360 --> 02:05:49,230
Live by the sword die by the sword.

999
02:05:51,880 --> 02:05:54,750
There is no other way for us.

1000
02:06:10,560 --> 02:06:13,020
There are lots of smuggled goods...

1001
02:06:13,880 --> 02:06:17,500
Don't let anyone get away!

1002
02:06:25,080 --> 02:06:26,990
Why won't you lead me to the harbor?

1003
02:06:27,120 --> 02:06:30,550
If you let me run away,
I'll pay you in abundance!

1004
02:06:35,800 --> 02:06:37,950
Money is in this pocket...
In this pocket!

1005
02:06:38,080 --> 02:06:39,590
There's money in it!

1006
02:06:40,760 --> 02:06:42,710
At least bring me other shoe, won't you?

1007
02:06:42,800 --> 02:06:43,310
Shut up!

1008
02:06:43,440 --> 02:06:45,590
It's so hard to walk!

1009
02:06:45,760 --> 02:06:48,470
I'll be back! You'll see!

1010
02:07:54,840 --> 02:07:55,510
Kenshin!

1011
02:07:56,320 --> 02:07:57,350
You're awake?

1012
02:07:58,040 --> 02:07:59,150
Kenshin!

1013
02:07:59,800 --> 02:08:00,550
Where's Kenshin?

1014
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:01,870
Eh? Ah, well...

1015
02:08:03,360 --> 02:08:05,030
What is it?

1016
02:08:06,360 --> 02:08:07,310
No, it can't be...

1017
02:08:07,560 --> 02:08:09,390
Wait!

1018
02:08:18,080 --> 02:08:18,990
Oro?

1019
02:08:26,040 --> 02:08:27,070
Kenshin!

1020
02:08:27,640 --> 02:08:29,830
You woke up, Kaoru-dono...

1021
02:08:30,240 --> 02:08:32,470
Listen to the end!

1022
02:08:32,880 --> 02:08:36,030
Kenshin promised to prepare dinner today.

1023
02:08:36,200 --> 02:08:38,310
I'm so hungry!

1024
02:09:06,360 --> 02:09:09,350
Welcome back, Kenshin...

1025
02:09:15,080 --> 02:09:16,950
I'm home.

1026
