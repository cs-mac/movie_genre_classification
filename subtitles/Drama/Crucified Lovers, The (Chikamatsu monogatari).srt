<i>[Episode 13]</i>

3
00:00:05,952 --> 00:00:07,833
Seriously, it came out again.

4
00:00:07,833 --> 00:00:11,236
See, you threw out this hair clip
for no reason and it's all bent now!

5
00:00:13,048 --> 00:00:14,755
Seriously...

6
00:00:14,755 --> 00:00:16,227
Hand it over.

7
00:00:19,075 --> 00:00:20,657
Come over here.

8
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,245
Did it work?

9
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:46,655
But... about that story of the Little
Mermaid you mentioned yesterday.

10
00:00:46,655 --> 00:00:48,565
Does it really end like that?

11
00:00:49,676 --> 00:00:54,066
To my knowledge, the Little Mermaid
doesn't disappear into sea foam bubbles.

12
00:00:58,092 --> 00:01:00,444
The Prince can't remember,
so what can you do?

13
00:01:06,454 --> 00:01:08,567
How would you have
liked it to end then?

14
00:01:10,522 --> 00:01:11,804
Me?

15
00:01:30,485 --> 00:01:32,651
Hey, hurry up!
The boat came in!

16
00:01:38,445 --> 00:01:41,143
People must be waiting. Let's go.

17
00:01:55,498 --> 00:01:57,452
About that Little Mermaid
story earlier...

18
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:01,507
I remembered how it ended.

19
00:02:03,137 --> 00:02:05,562
How... does it end?

20
00:02:15,967 --> 00:02:18,767
'The moment the Little Mermaid
turns into sea foam bubbles...'

21
00:02:22,043 --> 00:02:25,671
'The Prince's memory...'

returned.'

23
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,789
Shouldn't fairytales
usually end like that?

24
00:02:45,789 --> 00:02:47,218
A happy ending.

25
00:02:47,218 --> 00:02:49,557
People don't know fairytales very well.

26
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:55,931
Soo In, when did you get here?

27
00:02:55,931 --> 00:02:58,163
- Just now.
- Let's go.

28
00:03:12,105 --> 00:03:13,795
Are you all right?

29
00:03:16,743 --> 00:03:18,687
Yes.

30
00:03:18,687 --> 00:03:21,447
I'm sorry to have made
you worry over nothing.

31
00:03:23,121 --> 00:03:25,069
Not at all. Let's go.

32
00:03:37,222 --> 00:03:39,799
That's right. It isn't over yet.

33
00:03:40,251 --> 00:03:43,324
Snap out of it, Park Soo In.

34
00:03:49,086 --> 00:03:51,120
- This way.
- Yes.

35
00:03:54,296 --> 00:03:58,107
President Jo!
Let's have dinner together.

36
00:03:58,107 --> 00:04:00,192
I have something to
tell you as well.

37
00:04:25,604 --> 00:04:27,524
Let's eat.

38
00:04:28,292 --> 00:04:32,131
- Did you find what you lost?
- Yes, I did.

39
00:04:32,845 --> 00:04:35,102
What was it that you
were in such a hurry?

40
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,739
This is all because of that
hair clip you bought her.

41
00:04:39,963 --> 00:04:43,266
Spend money if you're going
to buy a present for your girlfriend.

42
00:04:43,266 --> 00:04:44,645
How countrified.

43
00:04:50,617 --> 00:04:52,447
Go on, eat.

44
00:04:58,474 --> 00:04:59,979
What?

45
00:04:59,979 --> 00:05:02,393
Is it the first time you've seen
someone wrap eel in lettuce?

46
00:05:03,509 --> 00:05:05,278
It's delicious wrapped
in sesame leaf as well.

47
00:05:05,278 --> 00:05:08,662
President Jo. I told you that
I had something to tell you.

48
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,138
Joon Hyun and I are getting engaged.

49
00:05:15,372 --> 00:05:17,744
I felt like you should know
ahead of time.

50
00:05:19,023 --> 00:05:23,240
We're planning a quiet occasion
without letting the press know.

51
00:05:24,673 --> 00:05:27,242
Yes well... that's
something to celebrate.

52
00:05:27,242 --> 00:05:29,446
Congratulations.

53
00:05:37,835 --> 00:05:41,393
Did I... do something wrong
by bringing up the engagement party?

54
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:48,689
I'm sorry for deciding that
on my own without consulting you.

55
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:53,107
No, it's okay. Let's go.

56
00:06:07,927 --> 00:06:09,403
You're going to go home, right?

57
00:06:11,018 --> 00:06:13,871
No, I'll go to the practice studio.

58
00:06:15,328 --> 00:06:17,456
I'd like for you to rest at home today.

59
00:06:18,951 --> 00:06:22,441
I'm fine. Don't worry about me.

60
00:06:26,838 --> 00:06:28,796
You don't have to be like that
in front of me.

61
00:06:28,796 --> 00:06:30,613
Do whatever you want.

62
00:06:30,613 --> 00:06:32,468
Don't hold it in.

<i>Joon Hyun and I are getting engaged.</i>

64
00:07:19,932 --> 00:07:23,538
Joon Hyun and I are getting engaged.

65
00:07:26,011 --> 00:07:27,867
Found it!

66
00:07:46,031 --> 00:07:49,351
We found this at the crime scene.
Is this yours?

67
00:07:56,113 --> 00:07:58,049
- Tae Song.
<i>- Where are you right now?</i>

68
00:07:59,127 --> 00:08:01,905
I'm on my way to hand my cellphone
to a repair shop...

69
00:08:02,938 --> 00:08:04,695
Never mind. I'll go myself.

70
00:08:06,699 --> 00:08:09,601
It'll take some time to recover
the videos.

71
00:08:09,601 --> 00:08:12,106
I'll contact you.

72
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:20,166
He isn't here.

<i>Customer, were you happy
with your service?</i>

75
00:08:47,321 --> 00:08:52,476
<i>We'll contact you when the phone
you gave us is repaired. Thank you.</i>

76
00:08:54,003 --> 00:08:55,515
He gave them a cellphone to repair?

77
00:08:55,515 --> 00:08:57,926
But this is his cellphone.

78
00:08:59,082 --> 00:09:01,640
No way...

79
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,569
- You're here?
- You're here.

80
00:09:12,272 --> 00:09:14,194
These are the locations for
our engagement party.

81
00:09:14,194 --> 00:09:15,748
Why don't you choose.

82
00:09:15,748 --> 00:09:18,276
I think this one is run down
despite it being popular...

83
00:09:18,718 --> 00:09:21,286
What? He already picked it up?

84
00:09:21,286 --> 00:09:23,707
Jang Joon Hyun picked up
his cellphone in person.

85
00:09:26,803 --> 00:09:28,554
Are you all right?

86
00:09:33,891 --> 00:09:36,207
Why didn't I think of
that cellphone earlier?

87
00:09:36,692 --> 00:09:38,986
It's all over if he looks
at that cellphone!

88
00:09:38,986 --> 00:09:41,320
It'll have pictures of them
together and everything!

89
00:09:42,111 --> 00:09:44,719
What do we do now?
What are we going to do?

90
00:09:44,719 --> 00:09:46,833
Calm down.
Your engagement's coming up soon.

91
00:09:48,273 --> 00:09:49,728
I'll take care of the cellphone.

92
00:09:49,728 --> 00:09:51,575
You trust me, don't you?

[Lee Hwa Soon: LA Address]

94
00:10:06,613 --> 00:10:08,797
Hello?

95
00:10:08,797 --> 00:10:11,371
Is this Hwa Soon?
It's me, Yang Joo Hee.

96
00:10:13,703 --> 00:10:15,748
Right, it's been a while.

97
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:19,698
Did you hear? That Joon Hyun
and Soo In are getting engaged?

98
00:10:19,698 --> 00:10:22,489
Goodness, you didn't know?

99
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:26,584
These are all the albums
Shine Star produced.

100
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:31,021
Should I call it a
kind of honorary hall?

101
00:10:31,695 --> 00:10:34,038
Wow.

102
00:10:34,038 --> 00:10:35,458
Choose one.

103
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:39,730
See if there's a record that
could be your role model.

104
00:10:47,207 --> 00:10:49,687
What if you put out a ballad?

105
00:10:50,421 --> 00:10:51,452
What?

106
00:10:51,452 --> 00:10:53,659
There's no rule saying
you have to stick to trot.

107
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:57,039
Think about it.
There are a lot of options.

00:11:08,356 --> 00:11:10,317
Yes, Soo In.

110
00:11:11,264 --> 00:11:13,520
Our engagement party
invitations came today.

111
00:11:17,806 --> 00:11:20,860
Who would you invite from Shine Star?

112
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,316
I was going to ask my mom first.

113
00:11:27,149 --> 00:11:29,398
Choon Hee.

114
00:11:33,642 --> 00:11:37,920
Our engagement party is on Monday.
You can come, right?

115
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,661
We shouldn't do that.
How about you sing a celebratory song?

116
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:47,195
We can quiet down the rumors
between the three of us that way.

117
00:11:47,195 --> 00:11:49,852
- Soo In.
- I have an event that day.

118
00:12:08,781 --> 00:12:10,951
I'm sorry.

119
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,324
About what?

120
00:12:14,337 --> 00:12:15,772
Asking you to sing
a celebratory song.

121
00:12:27,778 --> 00:12:29,714
Are you happy?

122
00:12:33,883 --> 00:12:36,810
What reason would I have...
not to be?

123
00:12:45,642 --> 00:12:48,477
That's enough then.

124
00:12:53,955 --> 00:12:56,371
I gave out all the invitations.

125
00:12:56,371 --> 00:12:58,738
I promised to give them
a call the day before...

126
00:12:58,738 --> 00:13:00,919
- Soo In?
- Yeah?

127
00:13:02,363 --> 00:13:05,206
Don't misunderstand what
I'm going to say and just listen.

128
00:13:07,038 --> 00:13:10,631
There's something I need to confirm...
before the engagement party.

129
00:13:10,631 --> 00:13:12,812
So about that...

130
00:13:12,812 --> 00:13:15,125
Couldn't we postpone
the engagement party?

131
00:13:15,856 --> 00:13:18,019
- Joon Hyun.
- No, it's that...

132
00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:20,936
- It's not because of something else...
- Is there another woman?

133
00:13:20,936 --> 00:13:22,440
Huh?

134
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,531
Tell me the truth.

135
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:27,082
It's not like that.

136
00:13:28,075 --> 00:13:30,170
That's enough then.

137
00:13:32,574 --> 00:13:38,191
Joon Hyun. After a sudden accident
and losing your memory...

138
00:13:38,191 --> 00:13:41,258
I understand that you're probably
really confused lately.

139
00:13:42,345 --> 00:13:45,402
Let's try a little harder, okay?

140
00:13:45,912 --> 00:13:49,169
And...

141
00:13:50,439 --> 00:13:52,206
Thanks.

142
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:57,614
You saved me at the concert hall.
I won't ever forget that.

143
00:13:57,614 --> 00:14:00,542
I wanted to make sure
that I told you these words.

144
00:14:17,359 --> 00:14:19,494
What's all this?

145
00:14:19,494 --> 00:14:21,127
Son!

146
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:25,716
Oh, my son! Have you been well?

147
00:14:25,716 --> 00:14:28,234
Mom. Why did you come here?

148
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:31,888
What do you mean? Should I not come
even if my son's getting engaged?

149
00:14:31,888 --> 00:14:36,467
Yang Joo... I mean,
Soo In's mother called me.

150
00:14:36,467 --> 00:14:38,937
My impressive son.

151
00:14:41,295 --> 00:14:45,385
How long has it been, Hwa Soon?
You haven't changed.

152
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:48,790
I always look the same.
But you've seemed to age.

153
00:14:51,522 --> 00:14:54,004
- We're both getting older.
- 'We'?

154
00:14:54,004 --> 00:14:58,504
Oh dear, there are people asking me
if I'm in my twenties in the States.

155
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:03,131
Mother, we're seeing each other
after quite a while.

156
00:15:03,131 --> 00:15:05,705
- Do you remember me?
- Oh yes, Soo In.

157
00:15:06,912 --> 00:15:09,092
It's the first time seeing each other
since you were young, right?

158
00:15:09,092 --> 00:15:13,377
- How pretty you've grown up to be.
- Thank you.

159
00:15:13,377 --> 00:15:15,602
But who's going to pay for the house?

160
00:15:17,275 --> 00:15:19,772
- House?
- The house the kids will live in.

161
00:15:19,772 --> 00:15:22,595
Shouldn't you have
prepared one if you're

162
00:15:22,608 --> 00:15:25,442
getting Joon Hyun
as a son-in-law?

163
00:15:35,515 --> 00:15:38,391
[Soo In]

164
00:15:51,021 --> 00:15:53,601
Are you happy?

165
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:07,349
Jang Joon Hyun and Park Soo In
are getting engaged today.

166
00:16:07,349 --> 00:16:10,719
What? Jang Joon Hyun
and Park Soo In?

167
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:18,586
Per your instructions, I also
looked into Yang Joo Hee.

168
00:16:18,586 --> 00:16:20,422
Is that right?

169
00:16:42,853 --> 00:16:45,931
You have to go back to your owner now.

170
00:16:51,548 --> 00:16:56,445
Right. You at least have to stay
by Jang Joon Hyun's side.

171
00:16:58,394 --> 00:17:00,678
I'll miss you.

172
00:17:21,692 --> 00:17:23,176
It was here.

173
00:17:32,982 --> 00:17:36,553
<i>I'll make sure to find
your guitar for you. Choon Hee.</i>

174
00:17:49,953 --> 00:17:54,754
Goodness, President Jo.
What brings you?

175
00:17:55,304 --> 00:17:57,601
Were you responsible
for the scandal

176
00:17:57,614 --> 00:17:59,922
between Choi Choon Hee
and the politician?

177
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,618
Excuse me?

178
00:18:02,618 --> 00:18:04,697
Choi Choon Hee is a singer
I told you to train.

179
00:18:04,697 --> 00:18:07,391
But you fed her to the wolves
like that, Director Yang?

180
00:18:09,864 --> 00:18:12,251
What was your reason for that?

181
00:18:12,251 --> 00:18:15,930
I don't know what you're talking about.

182
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:18,792
I don't know what
you've heard...

183
00:18:18,805 --> 00:18:21,678
Did you know Choon Hee
is Sung Joo's daughter?

184
00:18:22,465 --> 00:18:25,182
I have a debt to Oh Sung Joo.

185
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:29,758
I'll take care of Choi Choon Hee
until her father returns.

186
00:18:29,758 --> 00:18:31,917
I'm warning you, Director Yang.

187
00:18:31,917 --> 00:18:36,269
If you mess with Choi Choon Hee
one more time...

188
00:18:37,437 --> 00:18:40,487
I won't stand for it.

189
00:18:50,381 --> 00:18:55,771
President Jo just came by.

190
00:18:55,771 --> 00:18:57,801
He claims to know everything
about Choi Choon Hee.

191
00:18:57,801 --> 00:18:59,661
It's okay.

192
00:18:59,661 --> 00:19:05,532
If this gets out, then let's take
care of Choi Choon Hee for good.

193
00:19:14,918 --> 00:19:18,436
Jang Joon Hyun?

194
00:19:21,608 --> 00:19:24,148
Someone asked me to deliver this to you.

195
00:19:26,103 --> 00:19:29,623
Who... dropped this off?

196
00:19:29,623 --> 00:19:32,834
A woman dropped by not too long ago
and asked me to give this to you.

197
00:19:32,834 --> 00:19:35,121
- A woman?
- Yes.

198
00:20:12,234 --> 00:20:13,900
Choi Choon Hee?

199
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:18,266
Choi Choon Hee!

200
00:20:34,981 --> 00:20:38,117
Choi Choon Hee!

201
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,658
Choi Choon Hee!

202
00:20:48,103 --> 00:20:50,039
Choi Choon Hee!

203
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:54,794
Choi Choon Hee!

204
00:20:57,898 --> 00:21:02,174
Choi Choon Hee!

205
00:21:27,474 --> 00:21:29,529
Are you awake now?

206
00:21:33,368 --> 00:21:34,846
Choi Choon Hee.

207
00:21:34,846 --> 00:21:36,742
What about Choi Choon Hee?

208
00:21:40,702 --> 00:21:43,456
She's asleep.
She'll wake up soon.

209
00:21:47,386 --> 00:21:50,210
She'll be fine once she's stabilized.

210
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:52,444
Neither of you have to worry.

211
00:22:16,764 --> 00:22:22,168
<i>I want to say that I love you</i>

212
00:22:22,168 --> 00:22:28,490
<i>Just riding on this wish</i>

213
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:31,365
<i>Afraid that you might leave</i>

214
00:22:31,365 --> 00:22:31,487
- Choi Choon Hee.
- Hmm?
<i>Afraid that you might leave</i>

215
00:22:31,487 --> 00:22:33,479
- Choi Choon Hee.
- Hmm?

216
00:22:33,479 --> 00:22:36,038
Sorry.

217
00:22:55,927 --> 00:22:57,942
Are you okay?

218
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:00,769
Huh?

219
00:23:01,348 --> 00:23:04,184
I was a bit late, wasn't I?

220
00:23:30,699 --> 00:23:33,027
It's yours, Choi Choon Hee.

221
00:23:38,725 --> 00:23:40,525
- Over there.
- Joon Hyun!

222
00:23:40,525 --> 00:23:43,155
Joon Hyun!

223
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:45,524
Goodness, my son!

224
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:48,767
Son, what happened?
I heard you were in an accident!

225
00:23:48,767 --> 00:23:51,334
- Don't worry, I'm fine.
- Are you really okay?

226
00:23:51,334 --> 00:23:55,982
Yeah. But how did you know
that I was here?

227
00:23:55,982 --> 00:23:57,708
I tried calling and
the nurse picked up.

228
00:23:57,708 --> 00:24:01,581
But Joon Hyun, who were you
in such a rush to see?

229
00:24:01,581 --> 00:24:03,285
Huh?

230
00:24:03,285 --> 00:24:07,036
A friend who lives far away came by
and left without a word.

231
00:24:07,036 --> 00:24:09,259
I went looking for that friend, and...

232
00:24:09,259 --> 00:24:13,125
But now the engagement party is ruined
because of me. What will you do?

233
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:14,929
Is that the issue right now?

234
00:24:14,942 --> 00:24:16,757
We can reschedule
the engagement party.

235
00:24:16,757 --> 00:24:19,037
You should be getting better right now.

236
00:24:19,037 --> 00:24:21,255
Still, what a relief.

237
00:24:21,255 --> 00:24:26,268
Someone was complaining because they
didn't know you were in an accident...

238
00:24:28,139 --> 00:24:30,751
What a relief. Oh, my son.

239
00:24:30,751 --> 00:24:34,952
In any case, nothing good
can come from Yang Joo Hee's family.

240
00:24:34,952 --> 00:24:38,093
Like that accident on stage
and today's accident, too...

241
00:24:38,093 --> 00:24:40,678
What's going on?

242
00:24:43,322 --> 00:24:46,721
Figures, in Sung Joo's accident too...

243
00:24:48,038 --> 00:24:49,778
There was an accident in the past?

244
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,476
No, my son. It was nothing at all.

245
00:25:13,835 --> 00:25:17,396
Now that our son-in-law is well,
we should continue with the engagement.

246
00:25:17,396 --> 00:25:22,036
You saved me at the concert.
I won't ever forget that.

247
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:30,914
Even if this gets out, let's take care
of Choi Choon Hee for good next time.

248
00:26:09,716 --> 00:26:11,720
Are you awake now?

249
00:26:15,954 --> 00:26:18,736
You're looking for the man
that came in with you, right?

250
00:26:18,736 --> 00:26:21,192
- Singer Jang Joon Hyun.
- Was he really hurt?

251
00:26:21,192 --> 00:26:23,366
- Did he look okay?
- He went back home earlier.

252
00:26:23,366 --> 00:26:27,391
It's a relief that
both of you are fine.

253
00:26:27,391 --> 00:26:29,473
Ah, yes.

254
00:26:32,974 --> 00:26:35,237
That guy has no loyalty.

255
00:26:35,237 --> 00:26:37,469
How can he just leave?

256
00:26:39,637 --> 00:26:43,275
But it's a relief to
hear that he's fine.

257
00:26:56,098 --> 00:26:58,367
[Missed Call]

258
00:27:08,383 --> 00:27:10,638
You must be giving it
to your girlfriend.

259
00:27:11,812 --> 00:27:14,307
Who is it?

260
00:27:15,714 --> 00:27:17,624
It's President Jo!

261
00:27:22,227 --> 00:27:24,844
Here, a present for the Little Miss.

262
00:27:24,844 --> 00:27:27,504
Wow, it's candy! Looks delicious!

263
00:27:36,526 --> 00:27:38,800
What? You don't like candy?

264
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,802
That's not it...

265
00:27:40,802 --> 00:27:43,116
This is a bribe.

266
00:27:43,116 --> 00:27:45,784
- Huh?
- I'm a fair person.

267
00:27:45,784 --> 00:27:48,970
I'm going to keep a firm boundary
with you and Joon Hyun.

268
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:52,007
I won't stand for it
if you cross it.

269
00:27:52,007 --> 00:27:54,691
Ah, so there was that problem!

270
00:27:54,691 --> 00:27:58,641
That's right. How about this then?

271
00:27:58,641 --> 00:28:02,990
You eat this candy and also
eat the ones from that man!

272
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,959
That's fair then.

273
00:28:04,959 --> 00:28:07,943
It's fair not to receive anything
from anyone

274
00:28:07,943 --> 00:28:10,370
but isn't it also fair to accept
gifts from both people?

275
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:12,547
- Isn't that right?
- Oh!

276
00:28:12,547 --> 00:28:14,462
All right, here.

277
00:28:19,713 --> 00:28:21,806
What's this?

278
00:28:22,298 --> 00:28:25,163
I have to hand it to these adults.

279
00:28:25,163 --> 00:28:28,229
You shouldn't joke around
with food!

280
00:28:28,229 --> 00:28:29,925
I really thought it was candy!

281
00:28:29,925 --> 00:28:32,513
The real candy's here!

282
00:28:40,205 --> 00:28:41,774
- Is it good?
- Yes.

283
00:28:44,978 --> 00:28:46,863
This is for your sister.
Chocolate.

284
00:28:46,863 --> 00:28:50,976
Wow, chocolate!
I really like chocolate!

285
00:28:50,976 --> 00:28:52,920
No, you can't eat this, Byul.

286
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,283
There's a bitter alcohol in here
that only adults can eat.

287
00:28:55,283 --> 00:28:57,645
- Liquor?
- Yeah.

288
00:28:57,645 --> 00:29:00,333
Your sister is probably having
a hard day today.

289
00:29:00,333 --> 00:29:05,285
Tell her to eat these and
have sweet dreams tonight.

290
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:07,249
Got it?

291
00:29:07,249 --> 00:29:09,858
I think I know what you mean.

292
00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:21,682
What?

293
00:29:21,682 --> 00:29:23,922
This competition has
gone on, but it feels

294
00:29:23,935 --> 00:29:26,186
like the other competitor
has withdrawn.

295
00:29:27,203 --> 00:29:29,254
Jang Joon Hyun didn't get engaged.

296
00:29:29,254 --> 00:29:32,075
- What?
- They're rescheduling it.

297
00:29:32,075 --> 00:29:34,603
In any case...

298
00:29:34,603 --> 00:29:38,448
You should probably
pull it more towards you, huh?

299
00:29:38,448 --> 00:29:44,245
So what I'm thinking, is to give you
a proper chance to act as my father.

300
00:29:44,245 --> 00:29:46,281
Huh?

301
00:29:55,497 --> 00:29:58,350
<i>Ji Sook, I'm sorry.</i>

302
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:02,421
<i>Because of my momentary passion,
I couldn't look at you.</i>

303
00:30:02,421 --> 00:30:06,054
<i>I'll just keep watch over you
from a distance.</i>

304
00:30:10,722 --> 00:30:11,979
Tae Song!

305
00:30:11,979 --> 00:30:14,617
- Hi, Pil Nyeo.
- Have you been well?

306
00:30:14,617 --> 00:30:17,554
Look how much better you look
after being away for some time.

307
00:30:17,554 --> 00:30:22,063
It must make a difference. I feel
great and my skin feels good, too.

308
00:30:22,063 --> 00:30:26,699
Oh. Then you two went
on a trip together?

309
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:29,308
So you've officially
become a couple then?

310
00:30:29,308 --> 00:30:31,364
We've officially become a couple!

311
00:30:32,305 --> 00:30:34,750
Ji Sook!

312
00:30:35,979 --> 00:30:39,464
No, it's good.

313
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:44,211
Let's eat together.
Why are you eating alone?

314
00:30:44,211 --> 00:30:46,448
Should we order one more?

315
00:30:46,448 --> 00:30:49,262
- I'm... done. Done.
- You still have a lot left.

316
00:30:49,262 --> 00:30:51,097
You can't.

317
00:30:51,097 --> 00:30:53,042
- Goodbye.
- I'm leaving!

318
00:30:55,209 --> 00:30:57,381
They're embarrassed.

319
00:31:02,685 --> 00:31:03,961
Hi.

320
00:31:06,045 --> 00:31:08,274
I'm your top fan.

321
00:31:08,274 --> 00:31:12,543
- Hello.
- You're prettiest when you smile

322
00:31:12,543 --> 00:31:17,051
so why does your face look like it's
carrying all the burdens of the world?

323
00:31:20,959 --> 00:31:24,316
Should we hold a fan meeting
to boost your spirits?

324
00:31:24,316 --> 00:31:26,000
- A fan meeting?
- Yes.

325
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:29,135
Hi.

326
00:31:34,168 --> 00:31:37,244
What? Are you worried because
it'll be expensive?

327
00:31:37,244 --> 00:31:39,486
Afraid I might ask you to pay?

328
00:31:39,486 --> 00:31:41,976
Of course not, of course not at all.

329
00:31:41,976 --> 00:31:46,073
I'm just kidding.
Over here.

330
00:31:49,976 --> 00:31:54,100
President Jo.
What are you doing here?

331
00:31:55,718 --> 00:31:58,718
- I planned this with my father.
- Father...

332
00:31:58,718 --> 00:32:01,235
He's your father?

333
00:32:02,668 --> 00:32:04,736
- President Jo Hee Moon...
- Father.

334
00:32:04,736 --> 00:32:06,954
Goodness, oh my!

335
00:32:06,954 --> 00:32:10,321
There were so many things
I was curious about!

336
00:32:10,321 --> 00:32:14,279
I heard that you told Jang Joon Hyun
to train me.

337
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:16,793
But how did you know who I was?

338
00:32:16,793 --> 00:32:19,365
I was the one who trained your mother.

339
00:32:19,365 --> 00:32:23,068
It was the first job I had
when I established Shine Star.

340
00:32:24,549 --> 00:32:31,549
Then the person who gave up
singing was... my mother?

341
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:33,117
That's right.

342
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:37,136
Your mother was a great singer.

343
00:32:40,952 --> 00:32:43,130
But you knew about this too, President?

344
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:46,678
What? No, I just found out.

345
00:32:46,678 --> 00:32:51,619
But Father, Choon Hee must take after
her mother's excellent singing talent.

346
00:32:51,619 --> 00:32:55,497
That's right. I sometimes
see Choon Hee's

347
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:59,398
mother in Choon Hee's
performances.

348
00:33:00,089 --> 00:33:04,198
How about you make your mother's dreams
come true, Choi Choon Hee?

349
00:33:13,186 --> 00:33:18,918
<i>Mom, I want to become
an impressive singer like you.</i>

350
00:33:21,539 --> 00:33:24,485
<i>You're going to help me
concentrate on singing, right?</i>

351
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:29,409
<i>I miss you.</i>

352
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,473
Who is it?

353
00:34:06,639 --> 00:34:09,693
Is this Choi Choon Hee's...

354
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:14,127
Why are you at our house?

355
00:34:15,715 --> 00:34:17,163
Hey, Choi Choon Hee.

356
00:34:18,695 --> 00:34:22,278
Next time that happens,
don't get involved.

357
00:34:22,278 --> 00:34:26,518
If you have to get involved...
then call me.

358
00:34:33,387 --> 00:34:34,763
Boo!

359
00:34:35,377 --> 00:34:37,579
Why I ought to just...

360
00:34:37,579 --> 00:34:39,360
I feel better. Don't
you think of the

361
00:34:39,373 --> 00:34:41,164
person waiting at home
who made you food?

362
00:34:41,164 --> 00:34:44,252
- Hey, I'm sorry.
- Let's go.

363
00:34:44,252 --> 00:34:45,654
Agreed.

364
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:16,711
What brings you here?

365
00:35:38,214 --> 00:35:41,069
You dropped off my guitar
and left, didn't you?

366
00:35:41,069 --> 00:35:42,495
What was that?

367
00:35:42,495 --> 00:35:45,057
You entrusted that to me
when you were my manager.

368
00:35:45,057 --> 00:35:47,077
I entrusted that to you?

369
00:35:47,077 --> 00:35:49,137
I definitely gave that to the new...

370
00:35:49,137 --> 00:35:51,246
What?

371
00:35:51,246 --> 00:35:53,539
So what I'm saying is that

372
00:35:53,539 --> 00:35:56,521
it's a one of a kind so I wouldn't
have entrusted that to you.

373
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:58,943
I don't know your situation.

374
00:36:00,426 --> 00:36:04,158
Anyhow, what happened
to your engagement party?

375
00:36:04,158 --> 00:36:06,364
We're going to reschedule it.

376
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:08,003
Good for you.

377
00:36:09,305 --> 00:36:11,527
How could you have run out like that?

378
00:36:11,527 --> 00:36:13,245
What if something even worse happened?

379
00:36:14,468 --> 00:36:16,694
You don't even have a pretty face.

380
00:36:16,694 --> 00:36:19,235
You'll probably look good
if you get a scar.

381
00:36:19,235 --> 00:36:20,376
Did you come all the
way here to say that?

382
00:36:20,389 --> 00:36:21,541
That's not it...

383
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:25,144
Ah, it's hot!

384
00:36:29,225 --> 00:36:31,157
What's going on?

385
00:36:31,157 --> 00:36:33,955
- Why doesn't the rotation work?
- It's broken.

386
00:36:33,955 --> 00:36:36,316
During the summer?

387
00:36:36,787 --> 00:36:38,974
You're really something.

388
00:36:57,335 --> 00:36:59,513
<i>[Six times for a big one!
four times for a small one!]</i>

389
00:37:13,623 --> 00:37:15,303
I'm leaving.

390
00:37:15,303 --> 00:37:17,441
You called me yesterday, didn't you?

391
00:37:17,441 --> 00:37:20,557
- Yeah.
- How did you know my number?

392
00:37:20,557 --> 00:37:23,036
I asked Tae Song.

393
00:37:24,278 --> 00:37:26,015
Why did you call?

394
00:37:26,015 --> 00:37:28,427
That's because...

395
00:37:29,214 --> 00:37:31,854
I wanted to say thanks.

396
00:37:33,701 --> 00:37:37,858
Thanks... for yesterday.

397
00:37:39,546 --> 00:37:41,653
I'm leaving.

398
00:37:53,716 --> 00:37:56,569
<i>Thanks, Choi Choon Hee.</i>

399
00:37:56,569 --> 00:38:00,886
<i>For saving me... and
for finding my guitar.</i>

400
00:38:06,928 --> 00:38:08,886
What are you talking about?

401
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:12,892
It's not like we did anything!
Who's Park Soo In to bark out orders?

402
00:38:12,892 --> 00:38:14,866
She wants us to do
a homeless persons' event?

403
00:38:14,866 --> 00:38:16,800
Don't you think it's
too much, Chul Man?

404
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:21,380
Those people don't know
how to be grateful.

405
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:24,475
Forget all those people
who don't have a conscience!

406
00:38:28,932 --> 00:38:31,609
Choon Hee. What do you think?

407
00:38:33,309 --> 00:38:35,315
I want to do it.

408
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:39,322
I'll think of Dad,
and if he likes my

409
00:38:39,335 --> 00:38:42,468
song, then I think
I'll be strengthened.

410
00:38:42,468 --> 00:38:44,027
Okay, good.

411
00:38:44,027 --> 00:38:47,612
Chul Man, should we do
a dance this time, too?

412
00:38:47,612 --> 00:38:50,748
Of course. How could we not do one?

413
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:57,842
- Isn't that right, Ji Sook?
- You really are amazing, Chul Man.

414
00:38:57,842 --> 00:39:00,682
You're Choon Hee's manager
and her backup dancer.

415
00:39:00,682 --> 00:39:03,287
Do they call that 'a multi-player'?

416
00:39:04,734 --> 00:39:06,231
Goodness, look at me.

417
00:39:08,966 --> 00:39:11,399
Don't worry about the
chorus, Choon Hee.

418
00:39:11,399 --> 00:39:14,361
Tae Song, let's make sure
to practice and get it right this time.

419
00:39:14,361 --> 00:39:15,966
We have to match our lips.

420
00:39:15,966 --> 00:39:17,734
Like this and that,
they have to be in sync...

421
00:39:19,177 --> 00:39:21,286
Oh my endorphins.

422
00:39:21,286 --> 00:39:23,217
Thank you, everyone.

423
00:39:26,194 --> 00:39:27,745
- Tae Song.
- Huh?

424
00:39:31,029 --> 00:39:33,437
Pil Nyeo.

425
00:39:36,715 --> 00:39:37,858
Goodness.

426
00:39:37,858 --> 00:39:40,774
P...Pil Nyeo...

427
00:39:43,946 --> 00:39:46,402
Pil Nyeo! Pil Nyeo!

428
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:52,140
Good good! Your voice
just came through from behind you.

429
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,488
Now that you have your sound down.

430
00:39:54,488 --> 00:39:58,074
The 'feel' is very important in trot.

431
00:39:58,074 --> 00:39:59,952
'Feel.' Listen.

432
00:40:04,994 --> 00:40:09,280
<i>It was like this from the start.
I liked you</i>

433
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,282
<i>from the moment I first met you.</i>

434
00:40:13,282 --> 00:40:20,321
<i>Like a cold, I get feverish
and that's how I knew it was love.</i>

00:40:20,321 --> 00:40:23,057
<i>The wind is blowing</i>

like a happy pigeon.</i>

439
00:40:44,667 --> 00:40:47,285
- Hello.
- Hello.

440
00:40:48,568 --> 00:40:50,988
I'm trusting you all today!
Let's get together!

441
00:40:50,988 --> 00:40:53,141
We're... we're really doing this, okay?

442
00:40:53,141 --> 00:40:55,751
Let's do our best and be serious.

443
00:40:55,751 --> 00:40:58,887
Start! Choi Choon Hee!
Choi Choon Hee! Fighting!

444
00:40:59,437 --> 00:41:01,439
- Fighting!
- I'm really nervous.

445
00:41:06,721 --> 00:41:08,906
Hello. I'm singer Choi Choon Hee.

446
00:41:08,906 --> 00:41:13,812
I'll be singing 'My Way'
for you all today.

447
00:41:13,812 --> 00:41:17,235
How noisy! It's hard enough
living as  it is!

448
00:41:17,235 --> 00:41:20,935
- We can't even eat in peace?
- That's right! Let us eat!

449
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:25,785
Mister, you're very tired, aren't you?

450
00:41:25,785 --> 00:41:29,382
I really had a hard time
making a living, too.

451
00:41:29,382 --> 00:41:33,696
But the thing about music...
is that it's a great strength.

452
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:36,740
So if you give me just three minutes...

453
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:41,560
I want to be a small source
of strength for you all today.

454
00:41:42,074 --> 00:41:45,563
Could I sing just one song for you?
Thank you.

455
00:41:45,563 --> 00:41:48,474
Then I'll be singing 'My Way' for you!

456

<i>I thought that I came a long way.</i>

<i>I look back and you aren't there.</i>

458
00:42:13,513 --> 00:42:14,831
<i>- Not there!
- Not there!</i>

459
00:42:14,831 --> 00:42:19,521
<i>I really thought it would
rain hard.</i>

460
00:42:19,521 --> 00:42:23,219
<i>But there wasn't any.</i>

461
00:42:23,219 --> 00:42:24,689
<i>- Wasn't any!
- Wasn't any!</i>

462
00:42:24,689 --> 00:42:29,290
<i>At first I wasn't afraid...</i>

463
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:34,169
<i>But that scaredy cat changed
after some time.</i>

464
00:42:34,169 --> 00:42:38,259
<i>Everyone can fall at least once.</i>

465
00:42:38,259 --> 00:42:43,387
<i>But you can't get yourself down now.</i>

466
00:42:43,387 --> 00:42:49,071
<i>Until the day I collapse
going down my path</i>

467
00:42:49,071 --> 00:42:53,968
<i>I'm going to stand up and
face it one more time.</i>

00:43:43,089 --> 00:43:46,188
<i>- Is this Choi Myung Sik?</i>
- Yes, it is.

477
00:43:47,482 --> 00:43:48,927
Yes.

478
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:50,395
You postponed your
surgery before.

479
00:43:50,395 --> 00:43:52,944
What date should I reschedule it for?

480
00:43:52,944 --> 00:43:56,067
About that...

481
00:43:56,067 --> 00:43:59,990
I don't think I can get surgery.
I'm sorry.

482
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:02,324
You can't afford not
to get surgery at this time.

483
00:44:02,324 --> 00:44:06,224
<i>Choi Myung Sik!
Choi Myung Sik!</i>

484
00:44:16,165 --> 00:44:20,686
Joon Hyun. This came for you.

485
00:44:20,686 --> 00:44:22,956
Wow, it was...

486
00:44:23,862 --> 00:44:28,807
What's this? Jang Joon Hyun,
has your memory returned?

487
00:44:28,807 --> 00:44:31,604
Wow, this is good news!

488
00:44:31,604 --> 00:44:33,635
This is good! I'm so happy for you!

489
00:44:33,635 --> 00:44:35,463
- This is good news!
- Can you laugh right now?

490
00:44:35,463 --> 00:44:37,019
Get on your knees.

491
00:44:43,413 --> 00:44:46,675
I'm sorry.
I deserve to die.

492
00:44:48,108 --> 00:44:49,775
You deserve to die?

493
00:44:51,427 --> 00:44:53,367
For what?

494
00:44:53,367 --> 00:44:56,215
For having handed me over
to the police?

495
00:44:56,215 --> 00:45:01,446
Or not telling me about Choon Hee?
What do you think is the graver sin?

496
00:45:02,914 --> 00:45:05,331
The second?

497
00:45:06,074 --> 00:45:09,557
Forget it. There's something
you need to do for me.

498
00:45:09,557 --> 00:45:11,460
What's that?

499
00:45:12,773 --> 00:45:15,927
Keep it a secret that my memory's
returned for the time being.

500
00:45:15,927 --> 00:45:17,411
Huh?

501
00:45:17,411 --> 00:45:19,990
If Director Yang finds out, who know
what will happen to Choon Hee.

502
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:22,836
You can keep this secret, right?

503
00:45:24,245 --> 00:45:27,384
- I got it.
- I'll kill you if you betray me again.

504
00:45:28,784 --> 00:45:32,287
I... thought you'd be better
if I did that...

505
00:45:37,236 --> 00:45:39,583
Joon Hyun, is it okay
to overwork yourself

506
00:45:39,596 --> 00:45:41,954
like this when you
were just discharged?

507
00:45:44,167 --> 00:45:45,641
- Soo In.
- Hmm?

508
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:49,978
Just a minute.

509
00:45:57,546 --> 00:46:01,390
There's something that
I've been wanting to ask you.

510
00:46:03,313 --> 00:46:04,747
W...what's that?

511
00:46:06,408 --> 00:46:10,235
That day... the day of the accident...

512
00:46:11,483 --> 00:46:13,536
Why were you up on that stage?

513
00:46:14,463 --> 00:46:18,625
That wasn't your stage, but
Choi Choon Hee's concert.

514
00:46:20,955 --> 00:46:25,581
That... I went to cheer Choon Hee on.

515
00:46:25,581 --> 00:46:27,211
She's my junior, after all.

516
00:46:27,211 --> 00:46:29,502
I went because I should at least
be looking after her.

517
00:46:30,106 --> 00:46:32,443
I see.

518
00:46:33,865 --> 00:46:37,515
But the thing is... I keep having
these weird thoughts.

519
00:46:39,297 --> 00:46:42,390
That someone was targeting
someone else...

520
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:45,006
and that I was hit for their sakes.

521
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:49,736
By any chance...

522
00:46:49,736 --> 00:46:51,591
was that person was
targeting Choi Choon Hee.

523
00:46:52,262 --> 00:46:56,863
J...Joon Hyun, I don't even want
to think about that day.

524
00:46:56,863 --> 00:46:59,580
Do you know how surprised I was
when you were hurt?

525
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:02,186
I seriously thought that
something terrible happened to you.

526
00:47:03,438 --> 00:47:07,277
All that's important to me
is that you're safe, Joon Hyun.

527
00:47:07,277 --> 00:47:10,297
If someone targeted Choi Choon Hee...

528
00:47:10,297 --> 00:47:12,090
then that's a relief.

529
00:47:14,543 --> 00:47:16,595
But someone I love.

530
00:47:18,767 --> 00:47:22,247
If they were targeting you, then I
probably couldn't stand aside.

531
00:47:24,045 --> 00:47:26,388
I'd hunt them down to the end.

532
00:47:34,355 --> 00:47:36,779
Come in.

533
00:47:47,812 --> 00:47:49,787
Come in. What brings you here?

534
00:47:50,976 --> 00:47:52,850
I came to see you, of course.

535
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:56,602
Is that right?
Should I call Soo In over, too?

536
00:47:56,602 --> 00:47:58,346
We could all have dinner later.

537
00:47:58,346 --> 00:48:01,693
More importantly, I have something
to tell you, Director Yang.

538
00:48:02,652 --> 00:48:04,154
Go ahead.

539
00:48:05,251 --> 00:48:07,245
There's something that's been
on my mind.

540
00:48:07,245 --> 00:48:09,390
About the accident last time...

541
00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:14,313
I went to the office at the concert
because I'm superstitious.

542
00:48:14,313 --> 00:48:18,806
But it just so happened that
the CCTV cameras weren't on then.

543
00:48:20,158 --> 00:48:25,175
I lost my cellphone there too.

544
00:48:27,049 --> 00:48:28,895
And so?

545
00:48:28,895 --> 00:48:32,173
I'm thinking... that I need
to look more into it.

546
00:48:35,801 --> 00:48:39,827
Aren't you overdoing it when
your body isn't up to it yet?

547
00:48:40,472 --> 00:48:42,756
I'll look into that problem myself
from now on.

548
00:48:42,756 --> 00:48:44,460
- You...
- No.

549
00:48:45,234 --> 00:48:48,196
I'm the type who gets impatient
when I'm curious.

550
00:48:49,373 --> 00:48:51,727
I'm planning to hunt it down
myself to the end.

551
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:00,893
But the thing is...

552
00:49:00,893 --> 00:49:08,106
Why... are you telling me
all this right now?

553
00:49:08,984 --> 00:49:10,609
What do you mean?

554
00:49:12,593 --> 00:49:16,538
We'll be a family soon, and family
shares everything with each other.

555
00:49:16,538 --> 00:49:18,776
Am I wrong, Director Yang?

556
00:49:19,692 --> 00:49:23,385
Of course... you aren't wrong.

557
00:49:28,058 --> 00:49:29,921
Mom, Joon Hyun is acting weird.

558
00:49:29,921 --> 00:49:33,787
I'll say. He keeps
asking about that day.

559
00:49:33,787 --> 00:49:34,994
He went to you, too?

560
00:49:34,994 --> 00:49:37,637
Did his memory return
and he's pretending it didn't?

561
00:49:37,637 --> 00:49:40,003
Wait a minute.

562
00:49:40,003 --> 00:49:43,431
Let's think of an order.
What's the priority.

563
00:49:50,915 --> 00:49:53,709
When will our little Byul....
She's here.

564
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:06,282
Hey.

565
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,318
- Ow!
- I heard you hit my sister!

566
00:50:14,923 --> 00:50:17,903
You! You called your older
sister like a coward?

567
00:50:17,903 --> 00:50:20,372
You little punk!
So fearless!

568
00:50:20,372 --> 00:50:22,247
Do you want to be hit?

569
00:50:22,247 --> 00:50:24,853
You little punks! So fearless!

570
00:50:24,853 --> 00:50:26,389
Do you want to be hit?

571
00:50:26,389 --> 00:50:27,714
Mister!

572
00:50:27,714 --> 00:50:31,690
Who is it? You won't let go?
Let go!

573
00:50:32,406 --> 00:50:34,137
You let go first.

574
00:50:40,072 --> 00:50:43,880
Mister, don't butt in
and be on your way.

575
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:45,466
How annoying.

576
00:50:45,466 --> 00:50:48,696
Pick up the gum you spat out right now.

577
00:50:48,696 --> 00:50:50,316
What is he saying?

578
00:50:50,316 --> 00:50:52,596
This man, seriously...

579
00:50:52,596 --> 00:50:54,652
He doesn't know what
to be afraid of.

580
00:50:56,648 --> 00:50:59,780
Hey, who are you?

581
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:01,837
Who are you to talk like that?

582
00:51:03,414 --> 00:51:06,144
I'm...

583
00:51:07,693 --> 00:51:11,982
Music's god... Jang Joon Hyun.

584
00:51:11,982 --> 00:51:13,912
- Oh my god!
- Ah! Joon Hyun!

585
00:51:13,912 --> 00:51:15,811
You're really Jang Joon Hyun?

586
00:51:17,158 --> 00:51:18,981
What do I do? Hit me!

587
00:51:19,399 --> 00:51:22,065
It hurts! This isn't a dream!

588
00:51:24,189 --> 00:51:25,577
Kids.

589
00:51:25,577 --> 00:51:30,602
I'm part of Byul's family, but you
seem to be giving her a hard time.

590
00:51:30,602 --> 00:51:32,928
No, no. What do you mean?

591
00:51:33,691 --> 00:51:36,155
I'm seeing this cutie
for the first time!

592
00:51:38,717 --> 00:51:41,456
My little sister is really
good friends with her!

593
00:51:41,456 --> 00:51:43,649
- Isn't that right?
- Then...

594
00:51:43,649 --> 00:51:45,689
You're going to get along
from now on, right?

595
00:51:46,923 --> 00:51:48,707
Hurry up and answer.

596
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:50,872
Yes.

597
00:51:59,066 --> 00:52:00,854
- Should I give you an autograph?
- Yes, yes!

598
00:52:00,854 --> 00:52:03,279
- Should I take a picture with you?
- Yes!

599
00:52:03,279 --> 00:52:04,741
All right!

600
00:52:04,741 --> 00:52:07,122
- Does it taste good?
- It does.

601
00:52:09,049 --> 00:52:12,754
Byul, about today...

602
00:52:13,158 --> 00:52:16,381
I know. It's a secret
to my sister, right?

603
00:52:18,138 --> 00:52:19,313
Secret? Okay.

604
00:52:19,313 --> 00:52:20,603
Okay.

605
00:52:21,864 --> 00:52:23,767
- Bang!
- Bang!

606
00:52:23,767 --> 00:52:25,411
- Bang, bang!
- Bang, bang, bang!

607
00:52:25,411 --> 00:52:29,516
Choi Myung Sik? It's been a while
since I've seen him, too.

608
00:52:34,785 --> 00:52:36,645
Anyone home?

609
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:52,098
Father!

610
00:52:53,243 --> 00:52:55,713
Father, are you okay?

611
00:53:10,873 --> 00:53:13,110
Here, here, here.

612
00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:15,614
It's fine. It's hot, it's hot.
Be careful.

613
00:53:16,469 --> 00:53:19,420
You haven't eaten until now?

614
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:22,876
That's what I'm saying.
I said we should eat anywhere, but...

615
00:53:22,876 --> 00:53:29,094
For me, if I don't have the ox
bone broth you've cooked overnight

616
00:53:29,094 --> 00:53:31,855
to have this soondae soup...

617
00:53:31,855 --> 00:53:35,263
Then no matter what I eat,
it feels like I haven't eaten.

618
00:53:36,524 --> 00:53:37,977
Check, please!

619
00:53:37,977 --> 00:53:39,465
- Yes.
- Sit down.

620
00:53:39,465 --> 00:53:41,405
Coming!

621
00:53:43,425 --> 00:53:45,351
- For two, yes?
- Yes.

622
00:53:46,175 --> 00:53:48,221
Fourteen thousand Won.

623
00:53:50,585 --> 00:53:51,991
Goodbye!

624
00:54:03,879 --> 00:54:07,701
Father, are you awake now?

625
00:54:23,545 --> 00:54:27,341
In order to resolve my debts...

626
00:54:27,341 --> 00:54:30,511
I went to loan sharks and
took out a private loan.

627
00:54:32,174 --> 00:54:35,343
But then I was nearly beaten
to death by them.

628
00:54:37,139 --> 00:54:40,558
When I opened my eyes,
I was in the hospital.

629
00:54:41,870 --> 00:54:44,682
I also have colon cancer.

630
00:54:45,778 --> 00:54:52,037
I found out... that I only have
six months to live.

631
00:54:54,503 --> 00:54:57,614
I don't have the money
to pay for treatment, either.

632
00:54:58,554 --> 00:55:03,423
But I wanted to leave something
to my children before I went...

633
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:05,819
So I started cleaning.

634
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:12,435
But this pitiful life...

635
00:55:14,501 --> 00:55:17,713
is still breathing.

636
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:32,436
When I was in grade school...

637
00:55:32,436 --> 00:55:38,088
I came back from school
to find out that my father had died.

638
00:55:44,699 --> 00:55:46,487
I shouldn't have gone
to school that day.

639
00:55:49,231 --> 00:55:54,486
I should have stayed by his side
for one more hour...

640
00:55:58,594 --> 00:56:04,378
You hAve no idea how
long I regretted that.

641
00:56:10,678 --> 00:56:12,812
Father.

642
00:56:13,831 --> 00:56:17,628
Choon Hee's having a really hard time
because of various scandals.

643
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:21,934
I'm going to go back to Choon Hee.

644
00:56:21,934 --> 00:56:26,458
But before I do, couldn't you
take care of her for now?

645
00:56:31,410 --> 00:56:33,860
Even if it's just for an hour more.

646
00:56:43,465 --> 00:56:45,243
Yes.

647
00:56:46,118 --> 00:56:48,694
- President.
- Yes.

648
00:56:48,694 --> 00:56:51,708
Hello.

649
00:56:51,708 --> 00:56:54,415
I heard you had a concert
at a homeless persons' event.

650
00:56:54,415 --> 00:56:59,609
Yes, I went to help volunteer
but they were so good to me.

651
00:57:00,487 --> 00:57:04,271
It had a positive response,
so the company is going to help out.

652
00:57:04,271 --> 00:57:06,763
Oh really? That's really great news.

653
00:57:08,105 --> 00:57:11,555
And... at the concert...

654
00:57:11,555 --> 00:57:14,439
I think I discovered
an extremely important fact.

655
00:57:16,179 --> 00:57:18,220
Congratulating people
when they're happy,

656
00:57:18,233 --> 00:57:20,284
comforting those
when they're sad...

657
00:57:20,284 --> 00:57:25,758
and a song that doesn't differentiate
between age groups is trot.

658
00:57:27,027 --> 00:57:29,734
I really must be made for trot.

659
00:57:32,227 --> 00:57:34,776
I'm happiest when I sing trot.

660
00:57:36,047 --> 00:57:40,971
So about the ballad album
that you mentioned last time...

661
00:57:40,971 --> 00:57:43,110
Understood.
We'll pretend that never came up.

662
00:57:43,110 --> 00:57:45,017
As expected!

663
00:57:45,017 --> 00:57:47,151
Thank you!

664
00:58:01,572 --> 00:58:07,043
Choi Choon Hee? Yes it was her who was
hospitalized with Jang Joon Hyun.

665
00:58:15,248 --> 00:58:17,920
Has Joon Hyun's memories returned?

666
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:20,380
Or has he just fallen
for Choi Choon Hee again?

667
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:22,786
How do we make sure?

668
00:58:22,786 --> 00:58:25,262
Just do as I tell you.

669
00:58:29,742 --> 00:58:31,867
I'll cook it for you.
Go and get changed.

670
00:58:31,867 --> 00:58:33,415
Okay.

671
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:00,924
Choon Hee.

672
00:59:02,798 --> 00:59:06,844
The strings on my ukelele are fixed.
Did you fix them?

673
00:59:06,844 --> 00:59:08,668
No.

674
00:59:10,422 --> 00:59:13,181
Huh? The fan turns now.

675
00:59:55,458 --> 00:59:57,963
Joon Hyun, I love it.

676
00:59:57,963 --> 01:00:00,139
You bought this for me, right?

677
01:00:00,139 --> 01:00:01,758
It says 'Angel' here.

678
01:00:04,166 --> 01:00:06,417
It wasn't?

679
01:00:08,323 --> 01:00:10,434
What's with your expression, Joon Hyun?

680
01:00:13,034 --> 01:00:16,779
- I'm disappointed in you, Soo In.
- Huh?

681
01:00:23,454 --> 01:00:25,984
I wanted to give it to you properly.

682
01:00:27,283 --> 01:00:29,269
I wanted to see your
surprised expression.

683
01:00:32,232 --> 01:00:34,581
So are you angry, Joon Hyun?

684
01:00:34,581 --> 01:00:37,104
I'm sorry. What do I do?

685
01:00:38,665 --> 01:00:40,917
I'm just kidding.

686
01:00:40,917 --> 01:00:45,491
Why do I have such good taste?
It suits you perfectly.

687
01:00:47,434 --> 01:00:49,526
Seriously.

688
01:01:12,967 --> 01:01:16,305
Good thing you came!
Fix my ukelele strings for me!

689
01:01:16,305 --> 01:01:19,353
- The rotation's broken.
- In this heat?

690
01:01:19,353 --> 01:01:21,351
Watch out!

691
01:02:04,953 --> 01:02:08,917
I'll drink it well.

692
01:03:04,621 --> 01:03:07,114
I'm back.

693
01:03:16,414 --> 01:03:24,414
