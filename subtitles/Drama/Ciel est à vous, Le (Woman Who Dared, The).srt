1
00:00:59,883 --> 00:01:03,284
MAN BITES DOG

2
00:01:03,654 --> 00:01:07,283
I've just finished
ballasting the corpse, see?

3
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:10,850
That means you fill it
with certain things because...

4
00:01:11,629 --> 00:01:14,894
You may not be aware that
a corpse underwater

5
00:01:14,965 --> 00:01:17,160
swells up with air, see?

6
00:01:17,234 --> 00:01:19,600
So it tends to foat
to the surface.

7
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:22,468
You have to load it
with ballast so it sinks.

8
00:01:22,539 --> 00:01:25,599
You weight it down with stones
and other heavy stuff.

9
00:01:26,076 --> 00:01:28,271
There's a ballast ratio
for corpses...

10
00:01:28,345 --> 00:01:30,142
Three times bodyweight

11
00:01:30,214 --> 00:01:32,682
for an average adult
like this victim.

12
00:01:33,283 --> 00:01:36,684
But for children
and midgets it's different.

13
00:01:36,954 --> 00:01:38,785
Kids are lighter.

14
00:01:38,856 --> 00:01:40,380
So it's four times bodyweight.

15
00:01:40,457 --> 00:01:42,015
What?
- Never had problems?

16
00:01:42,092 --> 00:01:44,856
No. Midgets are heavier,
so you double the weight.

17
00:01:44,928 --> 00:01:47,692
Midgets have denser bones
so you double the weight.

18
00:01:47,765 --> 00:01:51,201
For old people, multiply by five.
Old bones are porous.

19
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:33,369
- Hi, Mom!
- Goodness gracious!

20
00:02:33,877 --> 00:02:36,277
How's my little boy?

21
00:02:37,481 --> 00:02:40,314
This is Mom, that's Grandma,
this is the store.

22
00:02:40,884 --> 00:02:42,749
This is where I grew up.

23
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,516
Grandpa's not here?
- He's out.

24
00:02:45,589 --> 00:02:47,716
He'll be back soon.

25
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:49,983
What time is it?

26
00:02:51,562 --> 00:02:54,053
Guess what...

27
00:02:54,631 --> 00:02:56,428
My Grandpa.

28
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,901
I've put up with her now
for 53 years!

29
00:03:01,171 --> 00:03:02,502
Imagine that.

30
00:03:02,573 --> 00:03:04,632
Imagine the effort it took him?

31
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:07,040
Guess who made the effort,
me or him?

32
00:03:07,111 --> 00:03:10,979
Hats off. I've put up
with her now for 53 years.

33
00:03:11,048 --> 00:03:14,211
He was such a cheerful little boy.

34
00:03:14,284 --> 00:03:17,378
Full of pranks,
and blond as a field of wheat.

35
00:03:18,589 --> 00:03:22,252
Don't tease me, Papa.
- Stop it or I'll cry!

36
00:03:23,994 --> 00:03:25,962
You ruin everything.

37
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:28,795
Benoit was such a delight.

38
00:03:28,866 --> 00:03:31,664
- A good boy?
- A darling!

39
00:03:31,802 --> 00:03:34,032
He was affectionate and sweet.

40
00:03:34,104 --> 00:03:36,072
Laughing all the time, all the time.

41
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:39,075
What do you mean, "he was"?
He's not anymore?

42
00:03:39,143 --> 00:03:43,546
You don't understand me, Papa.

43
00:03:44,181 --> 00:03:46,445
How they bickered!

44
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:49,577
Like cats and dogs!

45
00:03:53,457 --> 00:03:55,322
Lights!

46
00:04:03,934 --> 00:04:06,095
I usually start the month
with a postman.

47
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:08,365
I get up in the morning

48
00:04:08,472 --> 00:04:10,337
and spend it pinching pensions.

49
00:04:10,407 --> 00:04:14,537
At the same time this allows me
to locate old folks with money.

50
00:04:14,678 --> 00:04:19,081
What I avoid are young couples.
They stink of poverty.

51
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:23,279
It's unpleasant.
But old folks are loaded, that's for sure!

52
00:04:24,755 --> 00:04:26,780
I've never seen an old pauper.

53
00:04:32,062 --> 00:04:34,860
Stingy? Yes. But paupers? Never.

54
00:04:53,817 --> 00:04:56,251
You watching me... or the kids?

55
00:04:59,423 --> 00:05:01,448
They have guns just like me.

56
00:05:09,066 --> 00:05:11,057
Not bad at all, these gadgets.

57
00:05:12,336 --> 00:05:14,065
Give me one.

58
00:05:22,145 --> 00:05:23,612
Go on and play.

59
00:05:32,956 --> 00:05:34,514
No school today?

60
00:06:00,817 --> 00:06:01,818
That's the trouble with women.

61
00:06:01,818 --> 00:06:02,375
That's the trouble with women.

62
00:06:02,452 --> 00:06:04,147
Sure I've been hurt before.

63
00:06:05,956 --> 00:06:09,483
I gave them something,
they gave me something.

64
00:06:10,794 --> 00:06:12,591
But there comes a time

65
00:06:13,764 --> 00:06:16,130
when you start to ask questions.

66
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:18,324
All on account of that little door.

67
00:06:18,402 --> 00:06:20,927
In a couple,
the door has to stay open.

68
00:06:22,072 --> 00:06:23,801
And when it's open

69
00:06:23,874 --> 00:06:27,810
it's either to bring
in new nourishment...

70
00:06:28,078 --> 00:06:30,171
or it's to let you out.

71
00:06:30,247 --> 00:06:32,272
Either you add a little seed...

72
00:06:32,349 --> 00:06:34,874
and that seed can be a baby,

73
00:06:34,952 --> 00:06:36,920
or a good time or a holiday...

74
00:06:36,987 --> 00:06:39,956
Or you get out,
lock, stock and seed.

75
00:06:40,457 --> 00:06:43,620
With women, you can't always tell
if the door's open

76
00:06:44,428 --> 00:06:46,396
and if it's time to add a seed,

77
00:06:48,165 --> 00:06:50,326
or get the hell out.

78
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:54,364
I've been hurt
because I'd open the doorwide,

79
00:06:54,438 --> 00:06:56,303
and they'd shut it.

80
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:08,583
Love leaves a trail of sulfur

81
00:07:08,652 --> 00:07:10,483
like some lingering smell.

82
00:07:10,554 --> 00:07:12,784
As soon as you meet someone,
you smell it.

83
00:07:12,856 --> 00:07:16,849
Like when you take a leak,
your fingers smell.

84
00:07:16,927 --> 00:07:19,122
You have to wash them
two or three times

85
00:07:19,196 --> 00:07:21,187
so you can forget you pissed.

86
00:07:26,003 --> 00:07:28,164
Watch me, I'll show you a trick.

87
00:07:28,405 --> 00:07:31,602
As a kid they called me
"The Octopus."

88
00:07:32,476 --> 00:07:33,909
Know why?

89
00:07:33,977 --> 00:07:38,710
Because I could make
any part of my body move on its own.

90
00:07:38,815 --> 00:07:40,510
I'll show you.

91
00:07:41,084 --> 00:07:43,951
All by itself. Watch my nose.

92
00:07:45,155 --> 00:07:46,884
Look.

93
00:07:51,328 --> 00:07:54,456
Now my ears. Watch closely.

94
00:07:58,935 --> 00:08:00,800
See that? Look!

95
00:08:00,871 --> 00:08:04,534
Now the right one.
Now the left... See?

96
00:08:05,475 --> 00:08:08,137
I can make something else move,

97
00:08:08,712 --> 00:08:11,681
but it's not for the camera!

98
00:08:12,816 --> 00:08:14,716
Turn it off, you jerk!

99
00:08:21,992 --> 00:08:25,223
- Got home okay last night?
- No problem.

100
00:08:25,362 --> 00:08:27,762
I figured you guys
must have been bushed.

101
00:08:31,568 --> 00:08:33,502
Throw the keys down.

102
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,431
Or are you coming down?

103
00:08:35,505 --> 00:08:37,803
I'll throw you the keys.

104
00:08:58,295 --> 00:08:59,990
It's not the right key.

105
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,705
It's not this one.

106
00:09:11,775 --> 00:09:13,606
Must be the other one.

107
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:27,153
Look who's here! Benoit!

108
00:09:28,492 --> 00:09:30,824
I'm so glad to see you!

109
00:09:30,994 --> 00:09:34,623
What a surprise!
How've you been?

110
00:09:34,698 --> 00:09:37,360
Fine, Jenny.
I'm here with a camera...

111
00:09:37,434 --> 00:09:39,493
They're doing a thing on me.

112
00:09:40,737 --> 00:09:42,671
Do you mind?
- Not at all.

113
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:48,835
Come in, come in.

114
00:09:48,912 --> 00:09:50,777
Don't stay out there.

115
00:09:52,449 --> 00:09:55,816
So what's new?
- I had a rough time locating you.

116
00:09:56,186 --> 00:09:59,917
I thought you still lived at Sablon.

117
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:04,183
We were evicted by urban renewal.

118
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:08,763
Here's where we wound up.
- Maurice gave me the address.

119
00:10:08,832 --> 00:10:10,959
I'm so glad to see you!

120
00:10:11,635 --> 00:10:13,933
Got anything to drink?

121
00:10:14,337 --> 00:10:16,771
My throat's dry.

122
00:10:16,973 --> 00:10:19,305
- What'll it be?
- Some of your brandy.

123
00:10:21,511 --> 00:10:23,274
- How about your friends?
- Ask them.

124
00:10:23,346 --> 00:10:26,713
- What'll it be?
- Something cold.

125
00:10:26,783 --> 00:10:29,809
- And you, sir?
- A beer for me.

126
00:10:29,886 --> 00:10:31,444
- And you?
- A brandy as well.

127
00:10:31,521 --> 00:10:33,011
Coming up!

128
00:10:33,089 --> 00:10:34,818
That's my Jenny.

129
00:10:34,891 --> 00:10:37,689
That's her, this is her world.

130
00:10:37,761 --> 00:10:41,754
That's her in her prime,
when she was a beauty.

131
00:10:41,831 --> 00:10:43,526
She's still a beauty.

132
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:46,267
That's when I met her.

133
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:53,834
This is Jenny's bed.

134
00:10:55,145 --> 00:10:57,477
I'll show you something.

135
00:11:01,751 --> 00:11:05,084
You can tan while you make love.

136
00:11:07,023 --> 00:11:12,017
When you're through,
you've got a brown ass!

137
00:11:12,095 --> 00:11:13,653
Ever see anything like it? Bet not!

138
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:16,358
What nonsense!

139
00:11:17,267 --> 00:11:19,030
Baloney, baloney...

140
00:11:19,102 --> 00:11:21,434
Jenny used to live...

141
00:11:21,504 --> 00:11:24,371
I told you she moved.
That's why we had trouble finding her.

142
00:11:24,441 --> 00:11:27,774
She lived 30 years
in the Sablon district.

143
00:11:29,479 --> 00:11:32,505
Then some real estate developer...

144
00:11:32,582 --> 00:11:34,982
I can't remember the name,
but the hell with it...

145
00:11:35,352 --> 00:11:37,149
decided just like that

146
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:41,554
to move in.! Sure they could...

147
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:44,822
The law's on their side.
We didn't own the house.

148
00:11:45,328 --> 00:11:48,297
Anyway, they raised holy hell,
threw everyone out.

149
00:11:48,431 --> 00:11:50,922
But it was the way
they went about it...

150
00:11:52,168 --> 00:11:54,329
So, they told Jenny to move out...

151
00:11:54,404 --> 00:11:57,305
There was this little smart-ass,

152
00:11:57,374 --> 00:12:00,502
a vulgar little jerk,
who had the nerve

153
00:12:00,577 --> 00:12:04,013
to speak and behave rudely
with Jenny...

154
00:12:05,649 --> 00:12:08,709
The Sablon may have got a face-lift,

155
00:12:08,785 --> 00:12:11,686
but one guy's no longer around
to enjoy it.

156
00:12:12,489 --> 00:12:15,890
It's only fair if a member
of the family is wronged...

157
00:12:16,226 --> 00:12:19,684
So I went and had a little talk
with that fella...

158
00:12:29,939 --> 00:12:33,306
I'll call you back, sweets,
I'm still working.

159
00:12:34,277 --> 00:12:36,142
Talk to you in a sec.

160
00:12:44,154 --> 00:12:46,782
Those bastards!
A black night watchman!

161
00:12:46,856 --> 00:12:48,790
What a dirty trick!

162
00:12:48,858 --> 00:12:52,316
So you can't see him!
Who'd ever sink so low?

163
00:12:52,562 --> 00:12:54,530
They'll stop at nothing!

164
00:12:55,031 --> 00:12:57,659
Poor kid, born under the sun!

165
00:12:57,867 --> 00:13:00,335
I bet he grew up
under the baobabs,

166
00:13:00,403 --> 00:13:03,304
and here he is on a work site.
It makes me sick.

167
00:13:03,773 --> 00:13:06,207
They try to get away with murder.

168
00:13:06,276 --> 00:13:10,042
It's like this cement. Hungarian
probably. Made to last temporarily.

169
00:13:10,146 --> 00:13:14,549
You can be sure they use
more sand than cement, too.

170
00:13:15,151 --> 00:13:19,520
They pinch pennies,
then the walls crack!

171
00:13:19,589 --> 00:13:21,784
The whole building crumbles.

172
00:13:21,858 --> 00:13:25,555
I once buried two Arabs
in a wall over there..

173
00:13:25,695 --> 00:13:27,788
Facing Mecca, of course...

174
00:13:27,864 --> 00:13:30,458
In two years their assholes
will see daylight.

175
00:13:30,533 --> 00:13:32,501
Let's go sink this Mubutu.

176
00:13:32,569 --> 00:13:34,628
A handsome fella to boot.

177
00:13:34,704 --> 00:13:36,638
But I'm warning you,
I won't touch him.

178
00:13:38,308 --> 00:13:39,434
Why not?

179
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:41,067
AIDS, Rémy...

180
00:13:41,144 --> 00:13:43,612
AIDS. Green monkeys.

181
00:13:44,047 --> 00:13:46,777
Grab him by the galoshes,
but I won't touch him.

182
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:49,683
But why's he in yellow
if he's in camoufage?

183
00:13:49,753 --> 00:13:52,950
At least he had no dogs,
usually they have a pack of curs.

184
00:13:54,524 --> 00:13:57,493
I hate them. Blacks have a way
with animals, you know.

185
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,027
That's a fact.

186
00:13:59,095 --> 00:14:01,495
They know how to talk to them.

187
00:14:05,368 --> 00:14:07,233
Here's our golden opportunity.

188
00:14:07,404 --> 00:14:10,567
To see if that legend
about their size is true.

189
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,666
Rémy, pull his pants down.

190
00:14:17,414 --> 00:14:19,780
We'll know in a jiffy.

191
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,377
Good Lord!

192
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:26,452
He's really well hung.

193
00:14:29,626 --> 00:14:31,924
You can wrap it up now.
It's disgusting!

194
00:14:31,995 --> 00:14:35,487
The kid's barely 18
and already hung like a polar bear!

195
00:14:37,033 --> 00:14:40,002
Kids like that often work
in nightclubs.

196
00:14:40,136 --> 00:14:41,933
It's their livelihood.

197
00:14:42,005 --> 00:14:44,633
He must be a prude
to take a job like this.

198
00:14:44,808 --> 00:14:48,608
But some guys make a living
with their organ. Awful, isn't it?

199
00:14:48,678 --> 00:14:50,145
What's so funny?

200
00:14:50,213 --> 00:14:53,580
It sure won't make you a living.

201
00:14:54,284 --> 00:14:59,517
Here we are in a neighborhood
of mostly senior citizens.

202
00:14:59,823 --> 00:15:03,919
Planners design so-called
low-cost housing.

203
00:15:04,627 --> 00:15:06,720
Flats meant for young people,

204
00:15:07,063 --> 00:15:09,293
for newlyweds setting up house,

205
00:15:09,365 --> 00:15:11,458
for workers,
for housewives,

206
00:15:11,534 --> 00:15:13,297
and maybe even the unemployed.

207
00:15:13,369 --> 00:15:16,532
It's all part
of the district renewal plan

208
00:15:16,606 --> 00:15:20,542
that aims to bring old folks
out of isolation by mixing them

209
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:22,202
with the working population.

210
00:15:22,278 --> 00:15:24,143
It's a great idea,
but what I don't like is--

211
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,512
and here's the rub--
how can you design

212
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,949
low-cost housing projects

213
00:15:29,018 --> 00:15:31,179
in total disregard for aesthetics?

214
00:15:31,254 --> 00:15:33,222
I can't accept that, I'm sorry.

215
00:15:35,391 --> 00:15:38,849
They thought of planting
Japanese cherry trees

216
00:15:38,928 --> 00:15:40,896
along the lanes, see?

217
00:15:40,964 --> 00:15:43,330
In the style of English beach resorts.

218
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:46,095
A truly grand idea,
but did they do it?

219
00:15:46,336 --> 00:15:47,826
Did they do it?
- No.

220
00:15:47,904 --> 00:15:50,964
Yes, they did.
But they didn't follow through!

221
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,907
That's the shame of it.
It was purely cosmetic.

222
00:15:53,977 --> 00:15:57,208
Just to dazzle them,
and people fell for it.

223
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:01,375
I followed it all,
I saw how far their bright ideas went.

224
00:16:01,451 --> 00:16:03,681
What do you notice at first glance?

225
00:16:03,753 --> 00:16:05,778
What stands out?

226
00:16:06,356 --> 00:16:08,221
The red bricks!

227
00:16:08,691 --> 00:16:10,386
What's red bring to mind?

228
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:13,088
Red is the color of blood,
of Indians!

229
00:16:13,363 --> 00:16:15,331
It's the color of violence!

230
00:16:15,398 --> 00:16:19,835
And the scourge of society--
as everybody agrees-- is violence.

231
00:16:19,903 --> 00:16:21,666
So why the red bricks?

232
00:16:21,738 --> 00:16:23,638
Red is also the color of wine...

233
00:16:23,706 --> 00:16:25,833
For wining and dining.

234
00:16:25,909 --> 00:16:30,175
It's all about palm-greasing,
dirty politicians

235
00:16:30,246 --> 00:16:32,237
and wheeling and dealing.

236
00:16:32,315 --> 00:16:36,217
It pains me.
Wherever you take your camera...

237
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:39,687
Folks would love to stop and say,

238
00:16:39,756 --> 00:16:43,351
"What a lovely flower bed,
what powerful asymmetry!"

239
00:16:43,426 --> 00:16:46,224
"What a beautiful red hue of brick."

240
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:48,059
But they never get the chance.

241
00:16:48,131 --> 00:16:50,599
Instead they sit in front
of their TV sets.

242
00:16:50,667 --> 00:16:53,898
If I'd been asked to design
that kind of a layout,

243
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:56,996
I'd have planned
ground-level homes

244
00:16:57,073 --> 00:17:00,372
with spacious lawns,
a bit like Frank Lloyd Wright,

245
00:17:00,777 --> 00:17:03,746
in the style of Japanese houses.

246
00:17:03,813 --> 00:17:07,579
Despite their faults,
those people sure know how to live!

247
00:17:12,922 --> 00:17:18,360
You know, emphasizing aesthetics
is one thing,

248
00:17:18,761 --> 00:17:20,558
stressing the functional is another.

249
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,860
Those guys
overemphasize the functional,

250
00:17:23,032 --> 00:17:25,865
unlike people like Gaudi,

251
00:17:25,935 --> 00:17:29,132
who had a magnificent
architectural style,

252
00:17:29,205 --> 00:17:32,732
a very organic style,
forms that grow out of nowhere.

253
00:17:32,809 --> 00:17:35,471
Or Horta who did
such fabulous things,

254
00:17:35,545 --> 00:17:37,638
those great whiplash effects.

255
00:17:39,115 --> 00:17:42,380
Sorry to disturb you,
we're a television crew.

256
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:47,583
We're doing a report on loneliness
in high-rise apartments.

257
00:17:47,957 --> 00:17:50,755
Would you mind answering
a few questions?

258
00:17:50,893 --> 00:17:53,259
Of course,
if it doesn't take too long.

259
00:17:53,329 --> 00:17:55,524
I promise we'll be brief.

260
00:17:56,699 --> 00:17:58,223
Come in.

261
00:17:58,301 --> 00:18:00,235
You'll hardly notice us.

262
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:02,570
This is the crew.

263
00:18:04,841 --> 00:18:06,001
Sit down.

264
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:09,005
Go ahead.

265
00:18:09,479 --> 00:18:13,813
Don't let the camera intimidate you.
Just act and speak naturally.

266
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:18,216
It bothers me none.
I was filmed once in Mons.

267
00:18:18,821 --> 00:18:21,255
There was an army band concert.
I enjoyed that.

268
00:18:21,324 --> 00:18:24,259
That's fine, our subject
is used to the camera.

269
00:18:24,327 --> 00:18:25,658
Just fine.

270
00:18:25,728 --> 00:18:28,595
May I ask my first question?
- Ofcourse.

271
00:18:29,465 --> 00:18:33,868
Tell me, Madam,
among your friends and acquaintances,

272
00:18:33,936 --> 00:18:37,633
does anyone visit you regularly?

273
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:41,376
I have acquaintances...

274
00:18:42,245 --> 00:18:46,306
but I get along with everybody.

275
00:18:46,382 --> 00:18:48,111
They call me Granny...

276
00:18:48,184 --> 00:18:51,381
Granny Snuff, ever been snuffed out?

277
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,986
This is a special case.

278
00:19:01,898 --> 00:19:05,959
When I came in, I immediately
noticed the box of Sedocar.

279
00:19:06,035 --> 00:19:07,832
You may not know this,

280
00:19:07,904 --> 00:19:10,964
but Sedocar is a drug
for heart patients.

281
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,531
So I just freaked her out,

282
00:19:13,676 --> 00:19:16,474
which saves me a bullet.

283
00:19:17,346 --> 00:19:20,611
It's so much easier on the neighbors,
on me, and on her.

284
00:19:20,683 --> 00:19:23,516
I like to try out new work methods.

285
00:19:23,953 --> 00:19:26,649
She's fading fast now.

286
00:19:26,756 --> 00:19:30,157
We may as well go straight
to the heart of the matter.

287
00:19:30,226 --> 00:19:33,059
Let's hit the jackpot.
On to the kitchen?

288
00:19:33,496 --> 00:19:35,396
Lift the tablecloth.

289
00:19:35,932 --> 00:19:38,059
I'm gonna have a drink.

290
00:19:45,942 --> 00:19:48,035
Help yourselves.

291
00:19:48,111 --> 00:19:49,806
There's plenty for all.

292
00:19:49,879 --> 00:19:52,177
I know you're filming
on a shoestring budget.

293
00:19:52,648 --> 00:19:54,878
I believe in sharing, no problem.

294
00:19:54,951 --> 00:19:56,077
Thanks, Ben.

295
00:19:56,152 --> 00:19:59,121
Back to work.
Follow me and I'll show you.

296
00:19:59,822 --> 00:20:02,256
I bet there's something
under the bed.

297
00:20:02,325 --> 00:20:06,421
I don't know, but I have
a feeling about this room.

298
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:29,850
The little hog!

299
00:20:39,095 --> 00:20:41,290
Now I'll show you something.

300
00:20:41,397 --> 00:20:45,333
Here's the jewelry,
glassware and stuff...

301
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,121
The old lady whet my appetite.

302
00:21:13,863 --> 00:21:15,524
Know what I'd like, Rémy?

303
00:21:16,332 --> 00:21:19,324
A nice big plate of mussels,

304
00:21:19,402 --> 00:21:21,893
with lots of veggies,
sauce, and fries.

305
00:21:22,438 --> 00:21:23,928
Where can you get mussels?

306
00:21:24,006 --> 00:21:25,837
- A restaurant.
- By the sea.

307
00:21:25,908 --> 00:21:27,535
You're my guests for a seaside dinner.

308
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:29,840
What do you say?
It's a two-hour drive.

309
00:21:29,912 --> 00:21:32,972
A big plate of mussels,
some drinks...

310
00:21:33,349 --> 00:21:35,840
It'll be a great evening.
Just to celebrate.

311
00:21:38,955 --> 00:21:40,479
What's wrong?

312
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:43,354
What's the matter?
Don't you like mussels?

313
00:21:43,426 --> 00:21:44,950
Sure, I do.

314
00:21:45,394 --> 00:21:47,055
Then why the blank look?
Let's go.

315
00:21:47,129 --> 00:21:49,927
I think André has to be home tonight.

316
00:21:50,366 --> 00:21:52,596
- You have to go home?
- I had other plans.

317
00:21:52,668 --> 00:21:55,136
Then call home
and let's hit the road.

318
00:21:56,172 --> 00:21:57,833
Patrick?

319
00:21:58,441 --> 00:22:00,033
What about him?

320
00:22:00,109 --> 00:22:01,838
Without André, there's no point...

321
00:22:01,911 --> 00:22:05,347
I'm the guy who should be invited!

322
00:22:05,948 --> 00:22:07,848
Let's paint the town red.

323
00:22:07,917 --> 00:22:12,616
What if we went another time?

324
00:22:12,788 --> 00:22:14,847
They have commitments.

325
00:22:14,924 --> 00:22:18,325
It's okay, if I plan in advance.

326
00:22:18,394 --> 00:22:20,419
It's nice of you, Ben.

327
00:22:21,564 --> 00:22:23,498
Then come with me.

328
00:22:27,203 --> 00:22:29,034
I have no car.

329
00:22:29,772 --> 00:22:33,538
- We'll all go some other time.
- Okay, forget it.

330
00:22:35,011 --> 00:22:37,809
I'll find a restaurant nearby.

331
00:22:38,581 --> 00:22:40,606
Never mind, guys.

332
00:22:41,317 --> 00:22:43,080
It'll be for another time.

333
00:22:43,152 --> 00:22:45,211
Sure, no problem, another time.

334
00:22:45,288 --> 00:22:47,813
We'll have plenty of opportunities.

335
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:49,890
Sure we will.

336
00:22:52,161 --> 00:22:56,655
See you around.
Let me know when you need me.

337
00:22:57,633 --> 00:23:00,534
- Do you want a lift?
- Walking's good for the appetite.

338
00:23:00,603 --> 00:23:04,130
- We'll give you a lift.
- I'd rather walk, for the appetite.

339
00:23:04,206 --> 00:23:06,800
Thanks anyway, guys.

340
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,483
André hinted earlier

341
00:23:19,555 --> 00:23:22,615
that you might have trouble
financing the rest of your film.

342
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:26,453
I'm naturally ready to share
the cost of film.

343
00:23:26,529 --> 00:23:29,589
- I'd be delighted.
- That's nice of you.

344
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:34,431
And if we have to work overtime,
we'll do it.

345
00:23:34,971 --> 00:23:37,769
We'll turn this film into an epic!

346
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,070
A toast to the old lady.

347
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:45,738
White or red?

348
00:23:45,815 --> 00:23:48,443
Shall I choose?

349
00:23:48,617 --> 00:23:50,380
We'll have this one.

350
00:23:50,753 --> 00:23:53,950
I'm afraid that's not
the wisest choice today.

351
00:23:54,523 --> 00:23:57,185
If you'll allow me...
- I'll allow you nothing.

352
00:23:57,259 --> 00:24:00,057
Take care of your face case,
then you can make allowances.

353
00:24:04,934 --> 00:24:08,495
At times, crafty as a fox,

354
00:24:09,638 --> 00:24:12,698
at times, a little rascal,

355
00:24:13,843 --> 00:24:15,777
at times, a gangster,

356
00:24:15,945 --> 00:24:18,140
but generous as they come.

357
00:24:18,681 --> 00:24:21,775
Whatever the amount
you need, Rémy,

358
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:26,882
Benoit will always,
and I mean always, deliver.

359
00:24:28,157 --> 00:24:29,749
Thanks, Ben.

360
00:24:46,609 --> 00:24:48,839
In a kingdom by the sea,

361
00:24:50,646 --> 00:24:52,773
along clear gulfs,

362
00:24:55,684 --> 00:24:57,948
and plump waves

363
00:24:59,355 --> 00:25:01,687
to stop the waves,

364
00:25:01,757 --> 00:25:05,591
and flying fish, gliding like gulls,

365
00:25:06,996 --> 00:25:10,523
and plankton to your heart's content,

366
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:12,863
and red salmon

367
00:25:12,935 --> 00:25:16,393
leaping from the heavens,

368
00:25:16,472 --> 00:25:20,272
the sour jelly fish
and purple sea weed,

369
00:25:20,342 --> 00:25:22,810
and the winter's kelp...

370
00:25:22,912 --> 00:25:27,872
Nothing shall stop me
from calling your name...

371
00:25:29,118 --> 00:25:33,578
Sea, Sea, Sea, O cruel mother,

372
00:25:33,656 --> 00:25:35,419
Oh, say, can you see...

373
00:25:41,864 --> 00:25:44,094
What are you waiting for,
douche bag, high tide?

374
00:25:44,166 --> 00:25:47,226
We'd better go.
Bring us a mop, please.

375
00:25:51,707 --> 00:25:53,299
I'm all right.

376
00:25:59,148 --> 00:26:01,241
Must be bad mussels.

377
00:26:02,451 --> 00:26:04,749
You don't feel sick?
- I'm okay.

378
00:26:04,954 --> 00:26:06,922
Let's go home.

379
00:26:07,223 --> 00:26:09,282
I'll pay and we'll leave.

380
00:26:26,408 --> 00:26:29,673
Meet Valerie--
thanks to her many worldly contacts,

381
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:32,541
she's given me a taste
of various artistic circles.

382
00:26:33,449 --> 00:26:35,542
Some of those circles
are very closed.

383
00:26:35,618 --> 00:26:37,449
Today we're in the world
of painting.

384
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,978
I have a keen interest in that world.

385
00:26:41,157 --> 00:26:43,853
This is a very nice Swedish exhibit.
Had a look?

386
00:26:44,126 --> 00:26:47,357
The Swedish are interesting...
intensely sensitive.

387
00:26:48,297 --> 00:26:51,892
An artist I really appreciate
is Bernard Buffet.

388
00:26:51,967 --> 00:26:54,458
Know his work?
You know who I mean?

389
00:26:54,837 --> 00:26:58,671
He did a poster for Robert Hossein...
Heard of him, no?

390
00:26:58,741 --> 00:27:01,232
For a show called
"The Life of Jesus."

391
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:04,006
It shows a big hand
reaching up to the sky.

392
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:06,639
And the hand's meant
to evoke Jesus.

393
00:27:06,715 --> 00:27:08,615
The scarification
and all that jazz.

394
00:27:08,684 --> 00:27:11,346
Big hands, big drawings...
A knockout!

395
00:27:11,487 --> 00:27:14,047
Hossein sure knows
how to pick his collaborators.

396
00:27:14,123 --> 00:27:16,523
You like Hossein?
His shows are great.

397
00:27:16,892 --> 00:27:18,621
Seen any?

398
00:27:18,694 --> 00:27:23,393
A great actor, too.
He's made lots of movies.

399
00:27:23,465 --> 00:27:26,957
He used to play dark romantic types
in those old costume pictures.

400
00:27:27,036 --> 00:27:29,266
Doyou know Ben's trade?

401
00:27:29,438 --> 00:27:32,532
You can speak up.
Your silence is eloquent!

402
00:27:32,741 --> 00:27:34,902
Some trade!
- Dummy!

403
00:27:36,111 --> 00:27:37,442
Doesn't it botheryou?

404
00:27:37,513 --> 00:27:40,175
I don't pry into his work.

405
00:27:40,249 --> 00:27:42,183
Everyone's got to eat.

406
00:27:42,251 --> 00:27:44,685
Besides, we're old friends.

407
00:27:45,287 --> 00:27:47,812
Talking about Buffet,
here it comes!

408
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:49,653
Over this way.

409
00:27:50,926 --> 00:27:52,587
Don't be afraid.

410
00:27:52,661 --> 00:27:54,686
The camera makes him nervous.

411
00:27:54,763 --> 00:27:56,458
Help yourselves to canapés.

412
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,227
I only eat the top part.

413
00:28:07,142 --> 00:28:09,770
- What note did you just play?
- Oh, it's an F sharp.

414
00:28:09,845 --> 00:28:12,507
- And what did you play?
- An F natural.

415
00:28:12,581 --> 00:28:14,913
That's right, ducky.

416
00:28:16,352 --> 00:28:18,343
In 4l4 time.

417
00:28:32,534 --> 00:28:34,695
Imet Valerie at the conservatory.

418
00:28:35,804 --> 00:28:38,170
Keep in time.

419
00:28:38,974 --> 00:28:40,839
You're playing too fast.

420
00:28:41,043 --> 00:28:43,443
She must've been about 10.

421
00:28:46,982 --> 00:28:51,817
She had long dark braids
right behind her ears,

422
00:28:52,388 --> 00:28:55,824
little white ankle socks
and a little skirt.

423
00:28:55,891 --> 00:28:58,325
She was always smiling,

424
00:28:58,861 --> 00:29:01,659
running here and there,
always late.

425
00:29:02,264 --> 00:29:03,925
We used to laugh about it.

426
00:29:03,999 --> 00:29:06,058
I must have been 17 or 18,

427
00:29:07,002 --> 00:29:09,971
and I took her under my wing
right off.

428
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:14,100
She'd play minuets
and short pieces for me.

429
00:29:14,209 --> 00:29:16,268
I'd try to accompany her.

430
00:29:16,979 --> 00:29:21,075
She went on to make a career
for herself, as you know.

431
00:29:21,684 --> 00:29:23,447
And I'm proud ofher.

432
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:25,853
I changed instruments.

433
00:29:25,921 --> 00:29:27,354
The piano?

434
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:29,851
The blunderbuss.

435
00:29:33,495 --> 00:29:36,794
But it's like a horn,
it needs polishing.

436
00:29:56,585 --> 00:29:59,418
Stay on his tail!

437
00:29:59,488 --> 00:30:01,718
You idiot!

438
00:30:22,344 --> 00:30:25,245
- I think I hit him.
- Where'd he go?

439
00:30:25,748 --> 00:30:27,079
In there.

440
00:30:39,094 --> 00:30:40,994
He came this way.

441
00:30:43,265 --> 00:30:44,755
Say, Rémy...

442
00:30:45,267 --> 00:30:47,360
Smell something funny?

443
00:30:47,503 --> 00:30:49,937
- What is it?
- Chickenshit.

444
00:30:50,305 --> 00:30:52,705
We're warm.
Doomsday is near.

445
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:18,917
Come and look.

446
00:32:19,394 --> 00:32:21,954
Up there by the skylight.
Look, Rémy.

447
00:32:23,065 --> 00:32:24,794
Look, Patrick!

448
00:32:25,801 --> 00:32:29,293
It's a pair. It's mating season.

449
00:32:34,943 --> 00:32:37,173
Look at this feather.

450
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,404
It's oily.

451
00:32:39,481 --> 00:32:44,145
The male secretes
a pungent greasy substance

452
00:32:44,219 --> 00:32:45,982
that lures the female.

453
00:32:46,588 --> 00:32:48,647
That's Mother Nature.

454
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:55,187
Pigeon, winged cloak of grey,

455
00:32:55,864 --> 00:32:58,094
In the city's hellish maw,

456
00:32:58,166 --> 00:33:00,134
One glance and you fly away,

457
00:33:00,702 --> 00:33:03,227
Your graceholds mein awe.

458
00:33:18,253 --> 00:33:19,948
Shit, shit, shit...

459
00:33:20,022 --> 00:33:22,286
Got a problem?

460
00:33:22,925 --> 00:33:24,825
I lost something.

461
00:33:25,827 --> 00:33:27,658
My I.D. bracelet.
- What?

462
00:33:27,729 --> 00:33:29,993
I lost my I.D. bracelet.

463
00:33:31,199 --> 00:33:33,099
Goddamn it!

464
00:33:33,168 --> 00:33:36,433
- Sentimental value?
- First Communion.

465
00:33:36,905 --> 00:33:38,839
It's a pain losing it, huh?

466
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:41,401
It was a pain to steal.

467
00:33:41,476 --> 00:33:44,036
There aren't many kids around
with my first name.

468
00:33:44,913 --> 00:33:47,074
It's worth a small fortune.

469
00:33:47,149 --> 00:33:48,946
I bought it with Dad.

470
00:33:51,353 --> 00:33:52,980
Patrick?

471
00:33:53,722 --> 00:33:56,418
See anything?
- Nothing down here.

472
00:33:58,527 --> 00:34:00,154
Rémy!

473
00:34:00,729 --> 00:34:04,756
Look over the railing.

474
00:34:04,833 --> 00:34:09,293
- Here?
- To the left.

475
00:34:09,605 --> 00:34:12,733
Here?
Don't see a thing.

476
00:34:12,808 --> 00:34:15,641
Move up, I see something shiny.

477
00:34:15,711 --> 00:34:18,578
Take a good look. Go up two steps.

478
00:34:19,314 --> 00:34:21,441
There's something shiny
to your right.

479
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:23,513
Here?

480
00:34:23,819 --> 00:34:25,650
That's not it.

481
00:34:25,721 --> 00:34:28,849
It's just a piece of metal.

482
00:34:47,342 --> 00:34:50,539
This happened to me in Biarritz.
The only time...

483
00:34:51,446 --> 00:34:53,004
Find anything?

484
00:34:53,649 --> 00:34:57,813
...I went swimming with my signet ring,
and lost it among the rocks.

485
00:34:57,886 --> 00:35:00,081
No way of finding it,just like now.

486
00:35:00,155 --> 00:35:02,020
I'd need a metal detector.

487
00:35:29,284 --> 00:35:31,309
Got a zoom lens?

488
00:35:32,354 --> 00:35:34,845
Can you zoom in and find him?

489
00:35:37,325 --> 00:35:38,986
You okay?

490
00:36:14,329 --> 00:36:18,231
Sorry about your pal.
It was an accident.

491
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:27,236
Stop it, kid, you start like that
and it becomes a habit...

492
00:36:27,342 --> 00:36:30,334
That's revenge... Stop it.

493
00:36:31,747 --> 00:36:33,715
Come on... I understand... Stop it.

494
00:36:43,625 --> 00:36:46,287
I'll buy you a drink at Malou's.

495
00:37:00,442 --> 00:37:02,740
I completely forgot
about this one!

496
00:37:14,189 --> 00:37:16,180
Help me get him in the trunk.

497
00:37:16,792 --> 00:37:18,453
Take his feet.

498
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:54,995
We'll make it a quick one,
I'm beat.

499
00:38:00,802 --> 00:38:03,794
Hi, Malou, how's life?
- Fine.

500
00:38:03,872 --> 00:38:05,362
Not much action.

501
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,068
Not for now. It'll pick up.

502
00:38:10,712 --> 00:38:12,771
You gotta have hope.

503
00:38:16,184 --> 00:38:18,209
Hereyou go.

504
00:38:28,296 --> 00:38:30,321
See anything worthwhile?

505
00:38:30,398 --> 00:38:32,525
I saw a real good boxing match.

506
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:35,092
The Moroccan featherweight..
A massacre...

507
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:37,261
He clobbered little Freddy.

508
00:38:37,339 --> 00:38:40,672
They wipe us out everywhere,
even in the ring. It's amazing.

509
00:38:40,742 --> 00:38:42,334
It's awful.

510
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:44,901
Real quick on his feet,
the little Moroccan...

511
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,710
And I mean little.
- They all are.

512
00:38:47,782 --> 00:38:49,682
You weren't big
in the ring yourself.

513
00:38:49,751 --> 00:38:52,117
No, but I had a real wallop.

514
00:38:52,187 --> 00:38:55,122
- You sure did.
- That's what counts, the wallop.

515
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:57,249
Take the train station murder.

516
00:38:57,325 --> 00:38:58,952
The restroom murder.

517
00:38:59,027 --> 00:39:01,359
Who got the headlines? Who?

518
00:39:01,663 --> 00:39:05,030
Come on, who got the headlines?

519
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,897
- The dentist.
- The dental mechanic!

520
00:39:06,968 --> 00:39:10,563
And the toilet attendant
didn't even get a single line!

521
00:39:11,273 --> 00:39:13,434
Little guys don't make waves.

522
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:15,371
If you kill a whale,

523
00:39:15,443 --> 00:39:18,310
you get Greenpeace
and Jacques Cousteau on your back!

524
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,643
But wipe out sardines
and you get a canning subsidy!

525
00:39:23,685 --> 00:39:25,778
I go for the small fry.

526
00:39:25,854 --> 00:39:28,220
- You're afraid of the big fish.
- What?

527
00:39:29,524 --> 00:39:32,789
- Afraid of the big fish.
- You don't get it! Bug off!.

528
00:39:32,861 --> 00:39:34,658
I'd rather talk to him.

529
00:39:34,729 --> 00:39:37,630
I'm not afraid of big stuff, Rémy,
honestly I'm not.

530
00:39:37,966 --> 00:39:40,196
I just don't like to make a fuss.

531
00:39:40,268 --> 00:39:43,795
I hate making waves.
I work small and reap big!

532
00:39:44,873 --> 00:39:49,310
But I know the nice suburbs.
Anytime you wanna go!

533
00:39:49,377 --> 00:39:52,642
- Let's go then.
- Whenever you like!

534
00:39:52,747 --> 00:39:54,544
- Not tonight.
- Why not?

535
00:39:54,616 --> 00:39:57,278
Because we lost our sound man,

536
00:39:57,352 --> 00:40:00,082
and without him
I don't feel up to it.

537
00:40:05,093 --> 00:40:07,994
And I still have to dump the cabbie.

538
00:40:09,531 --> 00:40:12,261
I'm going to the quarry,
the canal's a drag.

539
00:40:15,637 --> 00:40:17,127
This one's on me.

540
00:40:17,205 --> 00:40:18,934
Anyway...

541
00:40:19,441 --> 00:40:23,400
The shooting's temporarily on hold.

542
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,909
Patrick, our sound man...

543
00:40:30,185 --> 00:40:32,210
is dead.

544
00:40:35,256 --> 00:40:40,057
Things like that are
really hard to talk about.

545
00:40:41,162 --> 00:40:43,596
This may sound like a cliché...

546
00:40:50,305 --> 00:40:52,705
But it's an occupational hazard.

547
00:40:53,575 --> 00:40:55,770
We're all aware of that.

548
00:40:56,378 --> 00:40:58,676
I think Patrick was.

549
00:41:02,584 --> 00:41:04,882
And I think we should continue
the film...

550
00:41:07,222 --> 00:41:09,417
because this is your film, Patrick.

551
00:41:16,264 --> 00:41:18,664
That's what I wanted to tell you...

552
00:41:19,501 --> 00:41:21,628
that we're all thinking of you...

553
00:41:23,905 --> 00:41:25,770
and Marie-Paule,

554
00:41:25,874 --> 00:41:28,308
the girl you just moved in with...

555
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,173
who's carrying your child.

556
00:41:40,188 --> 00:41:42,019
So long, Patrick.

557
00:41:44,726 --> 00:41:46,523
Bear up, Marie-Paule.

558
00:41:51,633 --> 00:41:53,897
No, no, that one's much too big.

559
00:42:00,308 --> 00:42:02,003
Too near the street.

560
00:42:02,077 --> 00:42:04,272
Hold on a bit...

561
00:42:08,183 --> 00:42:09,946
Stop here, Rémy.

562
00:42:10,318 --> 00:42:11,785
Yeah, here...

563
00:42:25,166 --> 00:42:27,532
You wanted a nice suburban home,
take your pick.

564
00:42:27,602 --> 00:42:29,399
Nice grounds.

565
00:42:29,471 --> 00:42:31,939
All we have to do now is wait.

566
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,840
We wait nice and quiet
until dark.

567
00:42:34,909 --> 00:42:36,740
Hand me a beer.

568
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,612
Who shook up the beers?

569
00:42:43,318 --> 00:42:45,343
I haven't always been...

570
00:42:47,789 --> 00:42:49,347
Check that out.

571
00:42:49,424 --> 00:42:53,656
Ten years from now
she'll be sucking dick like her mother.

572
00:42:54,162 --> 00:42:56,562
Nature really does things right.

573
00:42:57,031 --> 00:42:59,727
Amazing. And she doesn't even
know it yet.

574
00:43:00,368 --> 00:43:02,962
Doesn't even know
the color of a cock.

575
00:43:05,707 --> 00:43:08,005
Say, Rémy, that reminds me...

576
00:43:09,077 --> 00:43:12,046
Aren't there a hell of a lot of gays
in your trade?

577
00:43:12,914 --> 00:43:15,280
In show biz?

578
00:43:15,617 --> 00:43:18,586
You oughta know,
there are more in your trade

579
00:43:18,653 --> 00:43:20,621
than in most normal trades.

580
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:24,590
You can say what you want.

581
00:43:24,659 --> 00:43:26,593
You don't mind me talking
about it?

582
00:43:27,829 --> 00:43:29,558
Look at Charles Trenet.

583
00:43:29,731 --> 00:43:31,961
Now there's a fagrant case for you.

584
00:43:38,706 --> 00:43:41,607
I think they're all over the place,
you know....

585
00:43:42,844 --> 00:43:45,335
It doesn't bother me personally.

586
00:43:45,446 --> 00:43:48,108
You must know a few.
- Like Cocteau?

587
00:43:48,249 --> 00:43:52,652
No, that'sJean Marais.
Butyou must know some gays, André.

588
00:43:53,955 --> 00:43:56,185
I was watching you three
the other day.

589
00:43:56,758 --> 00:43:59,420
You wouldn't happen to be gay?

590
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:01,555
No kidding, Rémy?

591
00:44:01,629 --> 00:44:04,564
Because I don't mind ifyou are...
No?

592
00:44:12,173 --> 00:44:13,902
Close the door, Rémy.

593
00:44:14,175 --> 00:44:16,006
She'll calm down soon enough.

594
00:44:24,419 --> 00:44:26,148
Honey!

595
00:44:36,664 --> 00:44:38,325
Catherine, get the door!

596
00:44:41,636 --> 00:44:43,501
Who was it, darling?

597
00:44:51,212 --> 00:44:53,840
André, Rémy!
Does this remind you of anything?

598
00:44:54,482 --> 00:44:56,313
The Old Gun !

599
00:44:56,384 --> 00:44:58,750
Philippe Noiret!
A nice movie.

600
00:44:59,587 --> 00:45:01,578
Franco, over here.

601
00:45:03,424 --> 00:45:05,858
Stick the mike here.

602
00:45:11,566 --> 00:45:14,228
That's my idea.
Fat Noiret didn't do that.

603
00:45:19,007 --> 00:45:21,168
Noiret's put on weight.

604
00:45:24,612 --> 00:45:26,978
Mommy! Mommy!

605
00:45:39,327 --> 00:45:40,885
I lost him.

606
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:46,958
Kid!

607
00:45:51,139 --> 00:45:53,664
Come on out!

608
00:45:54,375 --> 00:45:56,673
It's just for fun, kid!

609
00:45:58,413 --> 00:46:00,005
Little bugger!

610
00:46:03,284 --> 00:46:05,809
Come on, kid!

611
00:46:07,989 --> 00:46:10,457
You can't stay in the woods alone.

612
00:46:23,571 --> 00:46:25,471
Put out your spotlight.

613
00:46:29,877 --> 00:46:32,107
Put it on!

614
00:46:38,019 --> 00:46:39,850
Get him!

615
00:46:40,955 --> 00:46:43,446
Mommy!

616
00:46:45,626 --> 00:46:48,754
What the fuck are you doing?
Catch him, you morons!

617
00:47:06,748 --> 00:47:08,909
Damn it, he's as turbulent
as his mother!

618
00:47:09,384 --> 00:47:11,682
Rémy, gimme a hand,
get his arms and legs.

619
00:47:12,687 --> 00:47:14,985
Filthy kid, goddamn it!

620
00:47:16,791 --> 00:47:18,850
Hold his arms.

621
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:21,528
Do you kill many children?

622
00:47:21,696 --> 00:47:23,527
No.

623
00:47:23,598 --> 00:47:27,898
You must have noticed that I don't really
have the knack in this department.

624
00:47:28,436 --> 00:47:32,372
This must be my second or third kid
in five years.

625
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:33,805
Why?

626
00:47:33,875 --> 00:47:35,740
- I don't like infanticide.
- Why not?

627
00:47:36,210 --> 00:47:38,303
Kids aren't good business, Rémy.

628
00:47:38,379 --> 00:47:41,644
In theory, they're not bankable,
understand?

629
00:47:41,716 --> 00:47:43,616
You can still make something off him.

630
00:47:43,684 --> 00:47:45,845
You must mean kidnapping.

631
00:47:47,789 --> 00:47:51,020
But I think it's more ofa nuisance
than anything else.

632
00:47:51,092 --> 00:47:53,720
Especially
when the media gets involved.

633
00:47:54,328 --> 00:47:56,592
Now hold on,
I'm not talking about you.

634
00:47:57,765 --> 00:48:00,757
You're pretty discreet.
Congrats.

635
00:48:05,106 --> 00:48:06,801
That'll do it.

636
00:48:07,642 --> 00:48:09,507
The little creep really had us going.

637
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:14,809
Nothing here.

638
00:48:14,882 --> 00:48:17,009
We really blew it.

639
00:48:18,352 --> 00:48:20,843
I warned you about suburban homes.

640
00:48:21,556 --> 00:48:23,387
There are credit cards.

641
00:48:24,091 --> 00:48:26,821
You might as well
call the cops right now.

642
00:48:27,094 --> 00:48:29,085
Go on. There's the phone.

643
00:48:30,531 --> 00:48:32,431
This is bullshit.

644
00:48:34,235 --> 00:48:36,669
And we're running out
of cash for film.

645
00:48:38,039 --> 00:48:40,132
And we're running out
of cash for film.

646
00:48:41,209 --> 00:48:44,144
The problem's not cash.
That, I have.

647
00:48:44,879 --> 00:48:48,713
It's those three innocents.
There oughta be a law.

648
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:51,045
Well, I'm... I'm not...

649
00:48:52,153 --> 00:48:53,848
I'm not a lunatic.

650
00:48:53,921 --> 00:48:53,955
It's a shame to let big houses
fall into neglect like this.

651
00:48:53,955 --> 00:48:57,823
It's a shame to let big houses
fall into neglect like this.

652
00:48:57,959 --> 00:49:00,860
Throw a coat of paint
on the walls and mirrors--

653
00:49:00,928 --> 00:49:02,418
and it's Versailles.

654
00:49:02,497 --> 00:49:05,625
Could be, but it'll take more coats
than you think.

655
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:09,136
Your bad breath is
something awful, Rémy.

656
00:49:09,871 --> 00:49:12,431
You shouldn't talk
under people's noses,

657
00:49:12,507 --> 00:49:14,702
because it's really unpleasant.

658
00:49:14,775 --> 00:49:17,073
Watch out for the window, André.

659
00:49:17,144 --> 00:49:19,135
Stop bumping into things.

660
00:49:19,213 --> 00:49:22,046
Really! I don't know why,
but all day long

661
00:49:22,116 --> 00:49:25,916
you stink like a billy goat
when you talk loud under people's noses.

662
00:49:27,755 --> 00:49:29,985
Don't mind the mess.

663
00:49:30,825 --> 00:49:32,315
Come on.

664
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:35,128
How much you need this time?

665
00:49:35,563 --> 00:49:37,292
How much?
- 1 0,000.

666
00:49:37,365 --> 00:49:38,832
1 0,000!

667
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:41,425
Damn it, you spend it faster
than I make it, Rémy.

668
00:49:43,738 --> 00:49:48,334
Let me tell you something, Rémy,
your spotlight gets on my tits.

669
00:49:49,110 --> 00:49:51,135
Sorry, but there's not enough light.

670
00:49:51,312 --> 00:49:56,147
I know, butyesterdaywith the kid
it blinded me and disrupted mywork.

671
00:49:56,217 --> 00:49:59,243
- I'm sorry.
- Sure, you're sorry.

672
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:02,255
Here, for your bad breath--
have a candy.

673
00:50:07,361 --> 00:50:10,888
Right before he died, I told him,

674
00:50:11,999 --> 00:50:14,331
"Come on,
we've got enough footage.

675
00:50:14,602 --> 00:50:16,661
We've got enough sound."

676
00:50:16,837 --> 00:50:18,828
And he said,

677
00:50:20,675 --> 00:50:22,905
""We'll never have enough.""

678
00:50:25,947 --> 00:50:29,246
He was a charming boy...

679
00:50:31,852 --> 00:50:33,979
who wouldn't compromise...

680
00:50:37,959 --> 00:50:40,154
We're all thinking of you, Franco,

681
00:50:41,929 --> 00:50:43,954
and this film's dedicated toyou.

682
00:50:48,369 --> 00:50:51,270
And I'm thinking of Marie-Paule,
your girlfriend...

683
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:54,371
who's carrying...

684
00:50:57,078 --> 00:50:58,568
your child.

685
00:51:56,937 --> 00:51:59,735
Ricardo Giovanni,
alias the Nightingale.

686
00:52:00,107 --> 00:52:03,201
Capable but dissolute,
much too dissolute.

687
00:52:03,644 --> 00:52:05,373
Like all Mediterraneans.

688
00:52:07,882 --> 00:52:09,474
Come on out.

689
00:52:11,852 --> 00:52:13,342
Holy shit!

690
00:52:14,488 --> 00:52:16,718
A camera crew. Know 'em?

691
00:52:17,758 --> 00:52:20,454
I'm a director. This is my team...

692
00:52:20,528 --> 00:52:24,464
Holy smoke, André!
Get a load of the big camera!

693
00:52:24,665 --> 00:52:27,532
This is real fancy material.
Don'tyou want it?

694
00:52:27,601 --> 00:52:28,829
No, it's video.

695
00:52:28,903 --> 00:52:30,700
- And what's ours?
- Film.

696
00:52:38,145 --> 00:52:40,978
Let's take advantage
ofour luck, Rémy.

697
00:52:42,249 --> 00:52:44,410
This one's for you.

698
00:53:01,936 --> 00:53:02,103
That makes 68 francs...

699
00:53:02,103 --> 00:53:05,630
That makes 68 francs...

700
00:53:15,216 --> 00:53:16,843
Here you go.

701
00:53:17,718 --> 00:53:20,585
Doyou have any room, sir?
I'll giveyou a bag.

702
00:53:20,654 --> 00:53:23,122
1 80 grams. All right?

703
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:29,520
For once we have something
to celebrate...

704
00:53:30,030 --> 00:53:33,227
Don't tell her! I'll have some...

705
00:53:33,968 --> 00:53:36,334
Well, it's a French drink...

706
00:53:37,238 --> 00:53:39,138
Malaga wine.
- There is none.

707
00:53:39,206 --> 00:53:41,231
- Some Muscat.
- There's no Muscat.

708
00:53:41,308 --> 00:53:43,367
- No alcohol?
- None at all.

709
00:53:43,444 --> 00:53:45,571
- A Coke?
- That, I have.

710
00:53:46,013 --> 00:53:47,640
Ice cold.

711
00:53:48,983 --> 00:53:51,144
No, thankyou.

712
00:53:51,886 --> 00:53:53,353
Grandma's not here?

713
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:55,047
She's in the store.

714
00:53:55,623 --> 00:53:57,682
But I can still have
something else.

715
00:53:57,758 --> 00:53:58,986
What?

716
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:02,028
What I had with Hugues.

717
00:54:02,463 --> 00:54:04,590
- Port wine.
- Port!

718
00:54:08,803 --> 00:54:11,738
Be careful,
he's not allowed to drink.

719
00:54:11,906 --> 00:54:14,306
Don't give him a drink.
He shouldn't.

720
00:54:14,375 --> 00:54:16,605
- Why not?
- He's been sick.

721
00:54:17,111 --> 00:54:18,703
- Really?
- Yes, indeed.

722
00:54:18,779 --> 00:54:19,939
What did he have?

723
00:54:20,014 --> 00:54:23,347
Vascular spasms.
He could get a heart attack.

724
00:54:25,619 --> 00:54:28,281
So be careful.
He mustn"t overdo it.

725
00:54:28,355 --> 00:54:30,653
One glass...
He forgets, too.

726
00:54:31,225 --> 00:54:34,160
He forgets what he drinks,
and that makes it even worse.

727
00:54:34,228 --> 00:54:35,957
Understand?
- Yes, sure.

728
00:54:36,030 --> 00:54:37,759
He doesn't realize it.

729
00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:40,357
You promise?

730
00:54:45,306 --> 00:54:48,469
I have two pairs of panties of...
Brigitte Bardot's.

731
00:54:49,610 --> 00:54:51,942
The fellow was in raptures.

732
00:54:52,046 --> 00:54:56,642
But I tell him
it's 200 francs a pair.

733
00:54:57,718 --> 00:55:02,849
In those days, 200 francs
was a lot for the time.

734
00:55:03,824 --> 00:55:05,792
So we make a deal.

735
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:09,796
But I still had
to pick up the panties

736
00:55:09,897 --> 00:55:13,628
at the department store.

737
00:55:14,001 --> 00:55:17,334
I buy the panties, I rumple them,
I come back.

738
00:55:17,872 --> 00:55:20,705
- You bought two pairs?
- Two pairs?

739
00:55:20,774 --> 00:55:23,140
No,just one...

740
00:55:23,744 --> 00:55:26,838
So I give him one and I say,
""There are the panties.""

741
00:55:27,248 --> 00:55:29,182
And I get my 200 francs.

742
00:55:29,483 --> 00:55:32,680
So for 200 francs,
I sold Brigitte Bardot's panties.

743
00:55:33,621 --> 00:55:37,387
In those days, that's at least
1 ,000 francs nowadays.

744
00:55:37,992 --> 00:55:41,450
In those days.
- He still thinks it's her real panties?

745
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:44,664
I think he does.

746
00:55:44,732 --> 00:55:47,257
I recently asked him
ifhe still had them.

747
00:55:47,534 --> 00:55:49,798
He says, "I still got 'em."

748
00:55:50,704 --> 00:55:54,140
It's a true story.

749
00:56:15,029 --> 00:56:18,556
I think the chubby one there
was Grandma's sister.

750
00:56:23,704 --> 00:56:25,069
Switch on the lights, Rémy.

751
00:56:25,139 --> 00:56:26,970
These old films are just charming.

752
00:56:27,808 --> 00:56:29,298
Just charming.

753
00:56:29,376 --> 00:56:32,812
Grandpa didn't do so badly
with his tiny material.

754
00:56:32,913 --> 00:56:34,710
I love watching them.

755
00:56:34,782 --> 00:56:38,445
You're gonna break 'em.
Just take it easywith those.

756
00:56:41,388 --> 00:56:43,822
Let's go downstairs
beforeyou break everything.

757
00:56:43,891 --> 00:56:45,518
What did I tell you?

758
00:56:45,592 --> 00:56:48,186
- I think...
- I've had enough.

759
00:56:48,662 --> 00:56:50,493
- Doyou want an orange?
- No, I don't like fruit.

760
00:56:50,564 --> 00:56:51,622
Are you sure?

761
00:56:51,699 --> 00:56:54,691
They killed a child...

762
00:56:55,035 --> 00:56:57,401
Butjust before,
they killed his parents.

763
00:56:57,604 --> 00:57:00,937
So he saw his parents being killed.
Can you imagine?

764
00:57:01,008 --> 00:57:04,500
I swear if they did that
to a child of mine, I'd slaughter "em.

765
00:57:04,578 --> 00:57:07,376
And with me, there'd be no trial.

766
00:57:07,448 --> 00:57:10,008
I'd be judge andjury myself!.

767
00:57:40,381 --> 00:57:42,406
Has Roger been around
the ring lately?

768
00:57:42,983 --> 00:57:44,473
- Who?
- Roger.

769
00:57:44,551 --> 00:57:46,542
Haven't seen him in a while.
Why?

770
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:48,417
I hear he's boxing again.

771
00:57:50,691 --> 00:57:52,420
I don't know what happened.

772
00:57:52,493 --> 00:57:54,222
Kalifa.

773
00:57:55,929 --> 00:57:58,557
Tell the gentleman
how you got your job here.

774
00:57:59,033 --> 00:58:01,126
Mr. Benoit got it for me.

775
00:58:02,936 --> 00:58:05,336
You haven't come to see me
in a while.

776
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,071
What?
- I didn't know.

777
00:58:08,142 --> 00:58:09,939
I can't hearyou.

778
00:58:10,010 --> 00:58:12,103
I didn't know
whereyou were, sir.

779
00:58:14,181 --> 00:58:16,547
And no kiss from Benichou?

780
00:58:16,984 --> 00:58:19,043
He doesn't look happy to see me.

781
00:58:23,157 --> 00:58:25,148
The boy looks pale.

782
00:58:25,759 --> 00:58:28,785
Come see me after the fight.
I'll give you some money.

783
00:58:30,464 --> 00:58:32,398
Buy him a new satchel.

784
00:58:32,466 --> 00:58:35,094
And buyyourself some shoes.
You look like a gypsy.

785
00:58:41,675 --> 00:58:41,708
Film lovers!

786
00:58:41,708 --> 00:58:43,733
Film lovers!

787
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:45,642
Film lovers, good evening!

788
00:58:47,214 --> 00:58:50,115
Tonight, for one showing only...

789
00:58:50,184 --> 00:58:52,277
My big dick!

790
00:58:53,921 --> 00:58:56,151
You're not gonna start that again?

791
00:58:56,223 --> 00:58:58,623
Film lovers,
a slight change ofprogram...

792
00:58:59,893 --> 00:59:02,691
You're gonna see
Malou's great big tits.

793
00:59:02,763 --> 00:59:04,856
Malou! Your tits!

794
00:59:04,932 --> 00:59:06,832
Cut it out, Ben!

795
00:59:07,935 --> 00:59:10,130
You've gone far enough.
- Okay, okay.

796
00:59:11,805 --> 00:59:13,773
I've had it with your grossness.

797
00:59:15,175 --> 00:59:17,575
- What'll it be, Rémy?
- Another one.

798
00:59:17,644 --> 00:59:19,578
A Dead Baby Boy.

799
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:22,271
No more beer,
you're having a Dead Baby Boy.

800
00:59:23,450 --> 00:59:26,283
How about you?
- A Dead Baby Boy.

801
00:59:26,353 --> 00:59:28,412
- And the new guy?
- A screwdriver.

802
00:59:28,489 --> 00:59:31,219
You're having a Dead Baby Boy
with the rest ofus!

803
00:59:31,625 --> 00:59:34,287
Malou! Four Dead Baby Boys!

804
00:59:34,361 --> 00:59:35,794
What's that?

805
00:59:35,863 --> 00:59:38,297
What is it?
- A Dead Baby Boy?

806
00:59:38,365 --> 00:59:40,833
It's dynamite.

807
00:59:41,735 --> 00:59:43,635
You"ll see.

808
00:59:45,572 --> 00:59:49,201
Malou, make 'em stiff!.

809
00:59:51,912 --> 00:59:53,436
You know your problem?

810
00:59:53,514 --> 00:59:57,006
It's your temper,
it does you wrong.

811
00:59:57,084 --> 00:59:58,608
I wonder why.

812
00:59:58,685 --> 01:00:00,778
- It does you wrong.
- No, it doesn't.

813
01:00:00,988 --> 01:00:02,979
It'll doyou wrong soon.

814
01:00:03,056 --> 01:00:05,456
Quit laughing, you half-wit!

815
01:00:05,692 --> 01:00:08,183
Stop hitting me, creep!

816
01:00:08,996 --> 01:00:10,327
Holy shit.

817
01:00:12,966 --> 01:00:16,561
Areyou uglywhen you laugh!

818
01:00:16,637 --> 01:00:18,298
It's unbelievable!

819
01:00:19,573 --> 01:00:21,905
He's so uglywhen he laughs!

820
01:00:24,611 --> 01:00:26,909
You should have let me
fi lm him, André.

821
01:00:30,417 --> 01:00:32,385
Serve us up.

822
01:00:35,889 --> 01:00:37,823
A tear ofgin.

823
01:00:40,928 --> 01:00:42,452
Just a tear.

824
01:00:44,431 --> 01:00:46,331
A river oftonic...

825
01:00:50,437 --> 01:00:52,132
And then...

826
01:00:52,372 --> 01:00:53,930
the little victim:

827
01:00:55,108 --> 01:00:58,009
One part olive,

828
01:00:59,346 --> 01:01:01,075
one part sugar cube,

829
01:01:01,315 --> 01:01:02,805
and one part piece ofstring.

830
01:01:02,883 --> 01:01:05,477
And there's our Dead Baby Boy.

831
01:01:05,552 --> 01:01:07,349
A quick ratio quiz:

832
01:01:07,554 --> 01:01:11,547
How much ballast does it take
to sink a dead kid?

833
01:01:11,758 --> 01:01:13,282
Rémy?

834
01:01:16,363 --> 01:01:19,059
How many times
the kid's bodyweight?

835
01:01:19,399 --> 01:01:20,457
Twice his weight!

836
01:01:20,534 --> 01:01:23,503
Shut up and let Rémy answer.
Twice his weight, correct.

837
01:01:25,405 --> 01:01:28,863
Why? Because his bones are...
- Porous!

838
01:01:28,942 --> 01:01:30,842
IfI'm boring you,just say so.

839
01:01:30,911 --> 01:01:33,004
You're not even paying attention.

840
01:01:33,547 --> 01:01:36,448
Nowyou take
your Dead Baby Boy

841
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:39,077
and sink it.

842
01:01:40,153 --> 01:01:42,986
And you wait and see.

843
01:01:43,056 --> 01:01:45,991
When the olive rises...

844
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:49,025
Whichever comes up fi rst

845
01:01:49,096 --> 01:01:51,792
is the loser,
and buys the next round.

846
01:01:52,933 --> 01:01:54,696
It's as simple as that.

847
01:01:54,768 --> 01:01:57,532
Goddamn it.
I get myjacket soaked

848
01:01:58,038 --> 01:02:01,166
every time I serve a drink.

849
01:02:13,654 --> 01:02:15,383
You lose!

850
01:02:16,189 --> 01:02:17,781
Shit.

851
01:02:18,825 --> 01:02:22,522
Malou, set up another round.

852
01:02:26,667 --> 01:02:28,328
André's second...

853
01:02:29,870 --> 01:02:31,428
Rémy's third.

854
01:02:31,505 --> 01:02:34,269
That was a nice little package,
Vincent.

855
01:02:34,341 --> 01:02:36,866
Sucker.
He's a sucker.

856
01:02:38,378 --> 01:02:41,211
I'll buy the next one.

857
01:02:41,915 --> 01:02:43,610
I think...

858
01:02:48,522 --> 01:02:50,649
I'll eat my Dead Baby Boy.

859
01:02:50,957 --> 01:02:52,652
Waste not, want not.

860
01:03:02,669 --> 01:03:04,660
Never swallow the string.

861
01:03:13,013 --> 01:03:15,709
That was a great one!

862
01:03:18,251 --> 01:03:20,116
Get out!
I've had it with you!

863
01:03:20,187 --> 01:03:23,554
Just say I disgustyou!

864
01:03:23,690 --> 01:03:26,022
All because I have some faults!

865
01:03:27,627 --> 01:03:29,595
Cinema.!

866
01:03:30,597 --> 01:03:33,760
I'll go because I am cinema!

867
01:03:38,438 --> 01:03:42,101
From screen to screen,
film to film,

868
01:03:42,743 --> 01:03:46,975
I gave you my life,

869
01:03:47,447 --> 01:03:49,347
And you, Gabin,

870
01:03:49,649 --> 01:03:51,981
son of Lucien,

871
01:03:52,285 --> 01:03:55,686
it made you a good boy again!

872
01:03:55,756 --> 01:03:57,280
All together now!

873
01:04:01,094 --> 01:04:03,858
Get a shot of me while I piss,
that's it!

874
01:04:04,965 --> 01:04:06,956
Come on, you jerks!

875
01:04:08,702 --> 01:04:10,829
In the port of shadows,

876
01:04:12,038 --> 01:04:15,166
sings Michéle Morgan.

877
01:04:16,209 --> 01:04:18,575
Got a great pair of eyes on,

878
01:04:18,645 --> 01:04:21,341
Heputitsonicely, that Jean.

879
01:04:26,086 --> 01:04:30,113
From screen to screen,
from film to film,

880
01:04:35,729 --> 01:04:38,994
Ivan Rebrov,
Yuletide child,

881
01:04:40,167 --> 01:04:41,896
sometimes...

882
01:04:57,317 --> 01:04:59,114
And you, Ivan,

883
01:04:59,719 --> 01:05:02,187
sing Noel.!

884
01:05:14,835 --> 01:05:18,703
Hush, not a sound,
It's the night round.

885
01:05:19,873 --> 01:05:23,673
Hush, not a sound,
It's the night round.

886
01:05:24,277 --> 01:05:26,643
With diligence,

887
01:05:26,713 --> 01:05:29,648
Keep the silence,

888
01:05:29,716 --> 01:05:33,516
Onward without asound.

889
01:05:36,323 --> 01:05:38,587
Your turn.

890
01:05:39,292 --> 01:05:40,953
Don't move!

891
01:06:00,747 --> 01:06:05,013
I'll blow his brains out!

892
01:06:05,085 --> 01:06:07,019
What's your wife's name?

893
01:06:07,587 --> 01:06:09,179
Martine.

894
01:06:11,291 --> 01:06:13,919
I like to know a woman
before making her come.

895
01:06:13,994 --> 01:06:16,963
You're all beasts.
It takes a little gentleness.

896
01:06:17,898 --> 01:06:21,629
Like a little bird
coming home to roost.

897
01:06:21,768 --> 01:06:23,702
Like a little piggy.

898
01:06:24,771 --> 01:06:27,103
Filthy slut.

899
01:06:32,512 --> 01:06:35,208
See that?
She's moaning!

900
01:07:42,282 --> 01:07:43,749
Aftermy tour

901
01:07:43,817 --> 01:07:45,614
the concierge gave me this.

902
01:07:45,685 --> 01:07:48,848
It'd been in a box for 3 days.
It began to stink.

903
01:07:49,522 --> 01:07:52,582
I had a shock!

904
01:07:52,659 --> 01:07:54,991
I didn't know
ifI should wait to showyou.

905
01:07:55,061 --> 01:07:58,428
You did the right thing.
Put it away now.

906
01:07:59,165 --> 01:08:01,497
- I had to showyou.
- You did right.

907
01:08:04,638 --> 01:08:07,539
- Know what it means?
- Don't worry, I know.

908
01:08:07,774 --> 01:08:09,435
You see, Rémy,

909
01:08:09,509 --> 01:08:13,502
at that hideout I wasted
an Italian named Giovanni.

910
01:08:13,580 --> 01:08:16,845
Well, this is a warning
from his brother.

911
01:08:17,884 --> 01:08:20,478
I knew he'd turn up someday,

912
01:08:21,121 --> 01:08:22,952
but it's just a warning.

913
01:08:23,023 --> 01:08:26,049
Don't worry, Valerie,
Just burn it and forget about it.

914
01:08:31,965 --> 01:08:34,957
They'rejust Italians...
Small-time.

915
01:08:41,541 --> 01:08:43,907
He hasn't been working out regularly.

916
01:08:44,477 --> 01:08:46,707
Paul, go and work with Karim.

917
01:08:54,254 --> 01:08:56,222
- Does it hurt?
- A bit.

918
01:08:56,289 --> 01:08:58,348
But that's normal.

919
01:09:00,427 --> 01:09:03,225
I'm starting to get
some movement again.

920
01:09:03,296 --> 01:09:04,627
- Are you?
- Sure.

921
01:09:04,698 --> 01:09:06,097
Just look.

922
01:09:06,166 --> 01:09:07,861
Good for you.

923
01:09:08,168 --> 01:09:10,398
Careful, don't exert yourself.

924
01:09:11,037 --> 01:09:13,597
Don't overdo it.

925
01:09:18,545 --> 01:09:21,446
I'll be on my feet
in a couple of weeks.

926
01:09:21,881 --> 01:09:25,317
When you'reyoung,
you're in shape soon enough.

927
01:09:25,385 --> 01:09:29,412
When you've got your youth,
you mend quickly.

928
01:09:29,489 --> 01:09:30,956
You can be sure ofthat.

929
01:09:31,024 --> 01:09:32,753
Modern medicine works wonders.

930
01:09:32,826 --> 01:09:35,056
The things they can do today.

931
01:09:35,128 --> 01:09:38,620
I always warned him
this would happen.

932
01:09:40,066 --> 01:09:41,966
It was a great match.

933
01:09:42,035 --> 01:09:45,027
That's the way sports are.

934
01:09:45,238 --> 01:09:49,140
All that running around,
it's like soccer, you murder each other.

935
01:09:49,209 --> 01:09:51,575
Mom got a rat in the mail.

936
01:09:51,644 --> 01:09:54,078
A skewered rat!

937
01:09:54,147 --> 01:09:56,047
Really? A skewered rat?

938
01:09:56,416 --> 01:09:58,111
I know who sent it.

939
01:09:58,485 --> 01:10:00,419
It's those Taviers again.

940
01:10:00,487 --> 01:10:03,047
Guess what they did
Just recently?

941
01:10:03,189 --> 01:10:06,420
They pissed in
MadamJoquet's mailbox!

942
01:10:06,493 --> 01:10:09,985
All her letters soaked through,

943
01:10:10,063 --> 01:10:11,860
everything ruined.

944
01:10:11,931 --> 01:10:13,922
Unreadable.

945
01:10:14,901 --> 01:10:16,960
Why, did you read them?

946
01:10:17,570 --> 01:10:19,435
It hurts to laugh.

947
01:10:22,375 --> 01:10:24,366
When you see something like that...

948
01:10:24,911 --> 01:10:27,539
Butjust look
at that poor man there...

949
01:10:28,681 --> 01:10:32,515
His children don't even
come to visit.

950
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:36,880
What a shame.
- It's a shame.

951
01:10:37,457 --> 01:10:41,188
- Does he have kids?
- I think so.

952
01:10:42,228 --> 01:10:46,289
He must have children,
but he never gets any visits.

953
01:10:48,835 --> 01:10:50,894
Don'tyou smell something?

954
01:10:51,905 --> 01:10:53,497
A bit.

955
01:10:55,708 --> 01:10:57,835
Chickenshit?
- Not that.

956
01:10:58,311 --> 01:11:00,836
It smells like shit.
- Could be.

957
01:11:05,385 --> 01:11:07,444
Did you make caca?

958
01:11:07,821 --> 01:11:09,721
Did you make caca?

959
01:11:10,089 --> 01:11:11,613
Thankyou.

960
01:11:11,691 --> 01:11:14,251
That's kind ofyou,
but don't bother.

961
01:11:14,861 --> 01:11:16,726
You did make caca!

962
01:11:16,796 --> 01:11:20,960
I'm all right.
It's fi ne like that.

963
01:11:21,034 --> 01:11:23,229
I'll ring for the nurse.

964
01:11:24,370 --> 01:11:26,133
What for?

965
01:11:28,741 --> 01:11:30,470
He shits all day long.

966
01:11:30,543 --> 01:11:32,101
It doesn't bother you?

967
01:11:32,178 --> 01:11:35,511
It's like this all day, and he sings too.

968
01:11:36,249 --> 01:11:38,513
Shits and sings,
that's all he can do.

969
01:11:41,588 --> 01:11:43,283
He's a pharmacist.

970
01:11:46,059 --> 01:11:47,890
You again?

971
01:11:47,961 --> 01:11:51,419
You're just in time
for a real treat.

972
01:11:51,965 --> 01:11:55,901
- We did a big caca!
- I did it just foryou.

973
01:11:55,969 --> 01:11:58,494
I shit for nights,
I shit for days,

974
01:11:58,571 --> 01:12:00,903
I shit allover,
I shit always.

975
01:12:00,974 --> 01:12:04,034
If you'd only behave.
Behave!

976
01:12:05,845 --> 01:12:08,837
If you don't have looks,
at least have manners.

977
01:12:08,915 --> 01:12:10,883
You want to repeat that?

978
01:12:11,351 --> 01:12:13,615
I'm here to do myjob agreeably!

979
01:12:13,686 --> 01:12:17,520
If you call that work...
You enjoy it.

980
01:12:18,224 --> 01:12:21,751
You love shit, eh?
You sure raise a stink over crap!

981
01:12:21,828 --> 01:12:24,319
I giveyou plenty,
butyou're never happy.

982
01:12:24,397 --> 01:12:26,422
I'll change you.

983
01:12:27,033 --> 01:12:28,762
Countyour blessings!

984
01:12:28,835 --> 01:12:32,168
- You could leave me as I am.
- Wallowing in shit?

985
01:12:32,238 --> 01:12:34,468
You enjoy it.

986
01:12:34,941 --> 01:12:37,273
You'd be mad
ifthere wasn't enough!

987
01:12:37,343 --> 01:12:40,744
- Lucky they're not all like him.
- You'll get your money's worth.

988
01:12:40,813 --> 01:12:43,008
Let's go, my girl.

989
01:12:49,355 --> 01:12:51,585
I shit for nights,
I shit for days,

990
01:12:51,658 --> 01:12:54,718
I shit allover,
I shit always.

991
01:13:05,772 --> 01:13:08,070
Take care ofyourself.
And we'll go out

992
01:13:08,141 --> 01:13:10,769
and have that drink
when you're out and about.

993
01:13:53,353 --> 01:13:55,412
Talk about surprises,

994
01:13:56,322 --> 01:13:58,313
this takes the cake.

995
01:13:58,391 --> 01:14:00,552
Were you in on this?

996
01:14:01,361 --> 01:14:03,295
Hi,Jenny.

997
01:14:03,363 --> 01:14:05,524
This is a hell ofa surprise.

998
01:14:12,705 --> 01:14:14,195
Already rolling?

999
01:14:19,045 --> 01:14:23,072
It sure is nice to see people
in the pink.

1000
01:14:23,249 --> 01:14:25,217
You're all fixed now.

1001
01:14:25,785 --> 01:14:27,650
How's the hip,Jenny?

1002
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:30,052
- Getting better.
- Watch yourself.

1003
01:14:31,557 --> 01:14:34,788
You too, Valerie,
with all those drugs you take.

1004
01:14:34,861 --> 01:14:36,988
Especially the pill!

1005
01:14:39,899 --> 01:14:42,891
Let's have some cake.

1006
01:14:44,237 --> 01:14:46,000
Just a small piece,

1007
01:14:47,206 --> 01:14:48,969
I already ate at the hospital.

1008
01:14:49,042 --> 01:14:51,875
For me, a big piece,
like my piece!

1009
01:14:53,946 --> 01:14:56,176
It's worth tasting.

1010
01:15:02,655 --> 01:15:04,589
Here's to Ben.

1011
01:15:22,175 --> 01:15:24,735
- For me?
- From the whole crew.

1012
01:15:24,911 --> 01:15:26,776
How thoughtful.

1013
01:15:26,979 --> 01:15:29,948
Thanks, André, Vincent.
- Happy birthday, Ben.

1014
01:15:30,917 --> 01:15:32,350
What is it?

1015
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:36,847
It's not very heavy.
It can't be a bomb.

1016
01:15:38,591 --> 01:15:40,354
I'll open it.

1017
01:15:43,596 --> 01:15:45,894
That's a great idea.

1018
01:15:46,732 --> 01:15:48,700
A holster.

1019
01:15:48,835 --> 01:15:51,565
Just the right color.
Who picked it out?

1020
01:15:51,737 --> 01:15:53,967
- André.
- Thanks so much.

1021
01:15:54,707 --> 01:15:56,368
It was the perfect choice.

1022
01:15:56,442 --> 01:15:58,535
Help me put it on, Rémy.

1023
01:16:00,613 --> 01:16:04,640
It's just what I needed,
but never thought of it myself.

1024
01:16:05,351 --> 01:16:07,649
Quality leather, too.

1025
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:10,484
Can you get me my revolver?
I'll try it right now.

1026
01:16:14,127 --> 01:16:15,788
Found it, Valerie?

1027
01:16:18,431 --> 01:16:20,490
It's superb.

1028
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:24,063
What freedom of movement,
what a difference!

1029
01:16:25,605 --> 01:16:28,267
You can really move around
in a thing like this.

1030
01:17:01,641 --> 01:17:03,666
May I have some more bubbly?

1031
01:17:33,606 --> 01:17:35,574
Another present?

1032
01:17:36,809 --> 01:17:38,970
You're spoiling me.
- Aren't we?

1033
01:17:39,045 --> 01:17:40,706
What is it?

1034
01:17:52,225 --> 01:17:54,352
- It's a beauty.
- I thought so.

1035
01:17:54,427 --> 01:17:56,327
It's a real pleasure.

1036
01:17:56,762 --> 01:17:59,458
It"s a splendid seagull.
Got it in the frame?

1037
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:04,026
Isn't it nice?

1038
01:18:04,103 --> 01:18:05,934
A fine gull.

1039
01:18:08,140 --> 01:18:09,664
Have some more cake.

1040
01:18:09,742 --> 01:18:11,573
I haven't finished my first slice.

1041
01:18:11,644 --> 01:18:14,579
Anyway, I'm not that hungry.

1042
01:18:17,316 --> 01:18:19,443
That's sweet of you,Jenny.

1043
01:18:21,821 --> 01:18:23,413
You're welcome, sir.

1044
01:18:24,257 --> 01:18:26,054
If you like it.

1045
01:18:26,392 --> 01:18:28,622
You don't have to call me "sir."

1046
01:18:29,729 --> 01:18:32,630
What's this "sir" business
all ofa sudden?

1047
01:18:32,698 --> 01:18:35,531
True, I don't always say ""sir.""

1048
01:18:35,601 --> 01:18:37,501
How can I say it...

1049
01:18:37,570 --> 01:18:39,834
- You're moved?
- I'm moved...

1050
01:18:41,707 --> 01:18:43,971
By that pretty creature!

1051
01:19:15,708 --> 01:19:17,608
We can forget it.

1052
01:19:20,713 --> 01:19:22,374
Take a look.

1053
01:19:52,878 --> 01:19:55,972
What the hell are you doing?

1054
01:19:56,649 --> 01:19:59,243
I can still see a huge bundle
from up here!

1055
01:19:59,318 --> 01:20:01,479
Do I have to come
and do it myself?

1056
01:20:01,554 --> 01:20:03,317
Cover all that up!

1057
01:20:03,389 --> 01:20:06,756
Rémy, I can see legs sticking out!

1058
01:20:06,826 --> 01:20:08,885
Don't just stand there!

1059
01:20:08,961 --> 01:20:11,555
You have nothing better
to do than fi lm, André?

1060
01:20:11,630 --> 01:20:13,257
You faggot!

1061
01:20:15,968 --> 01:20:17,936
Am Ion television?

1062
01:20:50,903 --> 01:20:52,768
Shouldn't have done it like that.

1063
01:20:52,838 --> 01:20:56,239
I should have thrown him
on the crates and hit him.

1064
01:20:56,308 --> 01:20:58,674
He had me waltzing like a skirt.

1065
01:20:59,178 --> 01:21:01,703
He had time to kick me
in the nuts.

1066
01:21:07,119 --> 01:21:09,280
I can't move in this thing.

1067
01:21:09,655 --> 01:21:11,850
He got out of that nicely.

1068
01:21:16,262 --> 01:21:18,492
You could have given me
a hand there.

1069
01:21:25,604 --> 01:21:27,401
I didn't expect...

1070
01:21:29,942 --> 01:21:33,275
Teamwork means being able
to count on your colleagues.

1071
01:21:33,345 --> 01:21:36,508
But I couldn't count on you
this time, right orwrong?

1072
01:21:37,817 --> 01:21:39,250
Right.

1073
01:21:42,922 --> 01:21:44,787
It's a shame.

1074
01:21:51,630 --> 01:21:53,825
And stop making faces
behind my back.

1075
01:22:06,812 --> 01:22:09,406
Thejuryhandeddown its verdict
late this afternoon.

1076
01:22:09,615 --> 01:22:13,346

andhis usualsmug,
arrogantglintin his eye.

1079
01:22:18,958 --> 01:22:23,395
Don't talk tome about other murders
until the seareproven.

1080
01:22:23,462 --> 01:22:25,760
A harsh verdict
for such evidence?

1081
01:22:25,898 --> 01:22:30,494
Yes. I will be consulting my client
to decide if we'll appeal.

1082
01:22:30,603 --> 01:22:32,901
That's all I have to say.
Thank you.

1083
01:22:33,272 --> 01:22:35,001
Counsellor!

1084
01:22:42,715 --> 01:22:45,343
What would you like me
to bring you?

1085
01:22:48,687 --> 01:22:49,915
Nothing.

1086
01:22:49,989 --> 01:22:53,083
Don't say that.

1087
01:22:53,225 --> 01:22:55,216
We always need something.

1088
01:22:55,294 --> 01:22:57,592
What can I bring you
from the store?

1089
01:22:57,830 --> 01:23:00,628
I'll come see you often, I promise.

1090
01:23:00,699 --> 01:23:02,792
How often can I come?

1091
01:23:04,436 --> 01:23:05,994
I have no idea.

1092
01:23:06,071 --> 01:23:07,902
They didn't tell you yet?

1093
01:23:08,073 --> 01:23:10,541
Bring cigarettes.

1094
01:23:11,043 --> 01:23:14,012
- Smoking's allowed?
- Yes, it's allowed.

1095
01:23:14,079 --> 01:23:17,378
I'll bring some,
butyou need food...

1096
01:23:18,150 --> 01:23:20,118
Cigarettes aren't enough.

1097
01:23:21,353 --> 01:23:23,617
I don't believe it.

1098
01:23:25,157 --> 01:23:29,958
I don't believe anything they say.
I really don't.

1099
01:23:31,997 --> 01:23:33,794
I'm so sad,

1100
01:23:34,466 --> 01:23:37,094
but whatever happens,
I'll always come.

1101
01:23:58,524 --> 01:24:00,014
Rémy, it's Ben.

1102
01:24:00,092 --> 01:24:01,753

1103
01:24:02,161 --> 01:24:04,857
Meetmein two hours.

1104
01:24:04,930 --> 01:24:06,955
First, pick up Valerie.

1105
01:24:07,032 --> 01:24:09,830
Meetme
where we met the fiirst time.

1106

Without trumpets or banners,

01:24:42,234 --> 01:24:44,532
Seeit, here it comes.

1116
01:24:44,703 --> 01:24:47,069
The splendid autumn.

1117
01:24:47,940 --> 01:24:50,431
- Hi, Ben.
- Valerie's not with you?

1118
01:24:51,644 --> 01:24:53,612
She was to meet us here.

1119
01:25:02,988 --> 01:25:05,047
Can I have a cigarette?

1120
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:16,300
How'd the jailbreak go?

1121
01:25:18,570 --> 01:25:20,333
Take off, Rémy.

1122
01:25:20,506 --> 01:25:21,996
Where to?

1123
01:25:22,374 --> 01:25:24,205
To Valerie's.

1124
01:25:32,051 --> 01:25:33,712
Valerie!

1125
01:27:15,754 --> 01:27:19,622
- Water's no good for futes.
- Think shit's good for scales?

1126
01:28:38,170 --> 01:28:40,001
Is it serious?

1127
01:28:45,644 --> 01:28:50,172
Mom wasn't a musician!
Is that what you want to know?

1128
01:28:51,550 --> 01:28:54,246
She got hers with a broom!

1129
01:28:59,491 --> 01:29:02,255
Sorry, Rémy...
I'm sorry, kid.

1130
01:29:13,438 --> 01:29:13,639
I want to get some things
out of the closet.

01:29:13,639 --> 01:29:15,937
I want to get some things
out of the closet.

1132
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:23,145
It was a great hideout.

1133
01:29:23,315 --> 01:29:26,011
- Sorry?
- I said it was a great hideout.

1134
01:29:46,738 --> 01:29:48,467
- What'll you do now?
- What?

1135
01:29:48,540 --> 01:29:50,405
What doyou plan to do now?

1136
01:29:50,809 --> 01:29:53,801
I don't know...
Leave, in any case.

1137
01:29:54,713 --> 01:29:57,614
Got a place to go?
Whereyou know somebody?

1138
01:30:02,220 --> 01:30:03,812
So you're here, too.

1139
01:30:05,257 --> 01:30:06,952
Let's recite, Rémy.
