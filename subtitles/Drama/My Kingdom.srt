1
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,249
She's denied the cross
for her suicide,

2
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:13,293
and then buried
at the center of a crossroads.

3
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,462
Show me the logic!

4
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,340
- Father?
- What?

5
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,969
The devil is a practical man.

6
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,596
If she were a witch,

7
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:26,640
she's a poor return
on his investments.

8
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,559
- What do you know of logic?
- Well, I have ears, Father,

9
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,103
although one is notched,

10
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,981
because I love justice.
- You love thieving!

11
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,276
Shut up. You dig.

12
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:48,745
♪ When I were young
and so the world, ♪

13
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:52,124
♪ I was pretty as a girl. ♪

14
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,085
♪ I am now a man of "gravitas" ♪

15
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:58,839
♪ with a double chin
and a giant ass. ♪

16
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,051
Crusaders.

17
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:08,932
Clear the road, if you will.

18
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:33,957
Squire!

19
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:43,300
This is for the burial from my lord.

20
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:44,801
And a mass

21
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:46,803
for her soul.

22
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:52,684
Wait!

23
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:56,021
- Have you forgotten?
- She was your brother's wife.

24
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,106
She was a suicide.
Cut off her head!

25
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,067
And return the ax!

26
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,751
You know this place, my lord?

27
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:20,587
Know it?

28
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:22,047
I know all of it.

29
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,013
Your brother?
You have spoken to him?

30
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,766
On what matter, my lord?
He is still arrested.

31
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:36,186
Your brother is as responsible
for his wife's sin as I am.

32
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:38,355
Opinions differ, my lord.

33
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:40,774
The burial was...?

34
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:42,776
Yes.

35
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:45,612
- Yet you did not mutilate the person?
- No.

36
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,114
Good.

37
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:49,491
A law can go too far.

38
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,785
It can go too far.
I ask myself:

39
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,912
would Jesus do it thusly?

40
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:58,500
There is so much done in Christendom
of which Christ would be incapable.

41
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,794
Release your brother.
I cannot do without him.

42
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,296
But my brother,
my lord Bishop,

43
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:09,052
is possessed by the devil
and must be... examined.

44
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:11,721
Your brother is as mad as you are.
He grieves!

45
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,642
Without your brother, I cannot finish
my church. Let him out!

46
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,519
And give him this.

47
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:22,357
And tell him that he is
at the very center of my prayers.

48
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,078
The Bishop needs you.

49
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:20,457
- Release him.
- On your feet.

50
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,002
This is not heaven.
It's the world.

51
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,129
And there's troubles in it.

52
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:48,443
Do yourself no injury.
Other men are always good for that.

53
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:11,007
- And what of Jerusalem?
- Jerusalem?

54
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:13,885
In peril, my lord. As always.

55
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:17,430
We have stood there against
the Saracens for over 100 years.

56
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,474
The Saracens, as you call them,

57
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:23,270
have now unified in Egypt,
Syria and all Arabia.

58
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:28,358
- The Saracens have someone new.
- Saladin, their king.

59
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:29,484
Salah-al Din!

60
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:32,404
Gibberish!

61
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:35,657
Very fine.

62
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,285
And yet you do not drink.

63
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,872
A knight should be a knight.
A monk, a monk.

64
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:46,918
- Brother. - Not both at once.
That's what I say. Now...

65
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,755
I may be old-fashioned,
but, as for the cup,

66
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:57,679
I have an artificer,
a blacksmith. Or did have.

67
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:03,852
Which son of the blacksmith of my time
is the blacksmith now?

68
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,145
Balian.

69
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,646
The eldest.

70
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:08,982
His child died.

71
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:12,902
His wife fell into a melancholy.
She would not listen to reason.

72
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:14,738
She killed herself.

73
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:16,990
It occurs.

74
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:20,035
But what's that to you?

75
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,079
A private matter.

76
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:32,422
It's been six and twenty years
since my brother took the cross

77
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:37,344
and now he returns an actual baron
of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.

78
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,430
How is that for the lot
of a younger brother?

79
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:45,518
With no heir... it comes to me.
And thus to you.

80
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,812
Then I thank the stars for my uncle.

81
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,545
Go on.

82
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:20,553
Her grave was here.

83
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,347
Or was it there?

84
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:27,060
I'm afraid I can't tell you
the exact location.

85
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,813
I wasn't present at the burial.

86
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,193
Call me a liar.

87
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:36,903
You have reason.

88
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,243
You never fight back.

89
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:53,837
You always turn the other cheek.

90
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,840
Now, I think that
you conceive yourself without sin.

91
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:00,135
That is a sin!

92
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,669
We shall work.

93
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:41,528
Cullen, I told you to stop that! Now!

94
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,580
That is the man!
That is the man!

95
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,541
You're an armourer, yes?

96
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:59,003
An artificer, according to your lord
and this priest.

97
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,631
You have my sympathy
and my blessing.

98
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:06,386
Your dead wife and stillborn child
are today the subject of my prayers.

99
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:12,809
We need all these horses shod.
We need food, and we'll pay.

100
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,063
Says yes.

101
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:28,992
He has made great engines for sieges.

102
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:35,039
He has made war machines
that cast the largest stones.

103
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,876
He also works finely in silver.

104
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:43,423
He will be one of the few on your
journey worth more alive than dead.

105
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:44,841
Shut up.

106
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:53,850
Have you been at war?

107
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:55,894
On horse.

108
00:14:57,021 --> 00:15:00,481
- And as an enginer. - Against whom
and for whom did you fight?

109
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:04,903
For one lord against another.
On a point which cannot be remembered.

110
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,156
There's better game now.

111
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,699
One God against another!

112
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:13,369
- The pay is proportionate!
- Yeah, I've been telling him that!

113
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:07,256
Do you still advise
what you advised upon the road?

114
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:10,009
I do, my lord.

115
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:14,347
I know that this man, Balian,
mourns his wife.

116
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,443
What does that say?

117
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:31,280
What man is a man
who does not make the world better?

118
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,573
Leave me with this man.

119
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:44,419
God has made us men.
We must suffer all.

120
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,463
I, also, have lost.

121
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:58,975
Some say Jerusalem is the very center
of the world for asking forgiveness.

122
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:01,728
For myself

123
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:05,189
I call it here, now.

124
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,745
I knew your namesake.

125
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:29,255
I... knew your mother.

126
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:36,471
To be courteous, I should say
that it was against her objections.

127
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:41,684
That I was the lord's brother
and she had no choice. But...

128
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,187
I did not force her.

129
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:54,197
I have forgiveness to ask of you.

130
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,928
I am Godfrey,
the baron of Ibelin.

131
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:20,431
I have 100 men at arms in Jerusalem.

132
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:25,186
If you will come with me,
you will have a living and

133
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,815
you will have my thanks.
There it is.

134
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:31,526
Whoever you are, my lord,

135
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:37,156
my place is here.
- What made it your place is now dead.

136
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,123
You will never see me again.

137
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,751
If you want anything of me,
take it now.

138
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,089
I want nothing.

139
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,633
I am sorry for your troubles.

140
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,552
God protect you.

141
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,407
Jerusalem is easy to find.

142
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:22,451
You come
to where the men speak Italian

143
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:25,329
and continue
until they speak something else.

144
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:27,540
We go by Messina.

145
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:29,625
Good-bye.

146
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,207
The village does not want you.

147
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:15,254
When the old lord is dead,
they will drive you out.

148
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,637
When the Bishop is dead,
it is certain!

149
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:25,973
And you take my property.

150
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,100
- The Church.
- You.

151
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:31,229
They would have taken you
to Jerusalem,

152
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:32,772
away from

153
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:35,191
all this.

154
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,442
I arranged it.

155
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:45,159
I swear to you, you will have no peace
so long as you stay here.

156
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:50,248
No man ever needed
a new world more.

157
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:55,336
Imagine your sin and pain erased.

158
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:57,713
All.

159
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:11,018
If you take the crusade,

160
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:15,064
you may relieve
your wife's position in hell.

161
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:17,066
I put it delicately.

162
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,694
She was a suicide.
She is in hell.

163
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:24,740
Though, what she does there
without a head...

164
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:45,988
Wait here.

165
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,507
Have you come to kill me?

166
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,259
Even these days, it is not easy.

167
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:09,678
Well?

168
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:19,021
I have done

169
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:22,775
murder.

170
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:25,861
Haven't we all?

171
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:30,116
Is it true that in Jerusalem,
I can erase my sins

172
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:34,412
and those of my wife?
Is it true?

173
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,081
We can find out together.

174
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:41,585
Show me your hand.

175
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:01,397
Hey!

176
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:33,012
Pick it up!
Let's see what you're made of!

177
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,805
His hand is hurt, my lord.

178
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:38,100
I once fought two days
with an arrow through my testicle.

179
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,612
Never use a low guard.

180
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,155
You fight well!

181
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:53,449
Let's work on your skills.

182
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:01,165
You take a high guard, like this.

183
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:04,084
The Italians call it
La Posta di Falcone,

184
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:06,754
the guard of the hawk.
You strike from high.

185
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,380
Like this.

186
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:11,050
Do it.

187
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:13,260
Sword straighter.

188
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:17,181
Come on. Leg back.
Bend your knees. Sword straighter!

189
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:21,268
Defend yourself.

190
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:26,524
The blade isn't
the only part of a sword.

191
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:31,445
Attack.

192
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:41,455
I have your leave?

193
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,755
Pay attention.

194
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:56,053
Eins, zwei, drei,

195
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,138
vier, fünf!

196
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:14,154
What's this?

197
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,126
- Uncle.
- Nephew.

198
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:31,338
You have with you a man, Balian,
who killed a priest, his brother.

199
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:35,801
I'm charged by both my father
and the lord Bishop to bring him back.

200
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:45,644
What he says is true.

201
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:48,439
They have the right to take me.

202
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:50,357
I say he's innocent of the charge.

203
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,735
If you say he's guilty,
then we'll fight

204
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,112
and God will decide
the truth of it.

205
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:58,240
My German friend
is a close student of the law.

206
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:01,035
Just give him to me.
I'll fight you for something else.

207
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:03,787
Uncle, he's a murderer.

208
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:05,956
So am I.

209
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:14,548
Whoever dies here today,
you will certainly be among them.

210
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:16,634
You're my uncle.

211
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:18,802
I must give you the road.

212
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:32,316
Heinrich!

213
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:34,568
Heinrich!

214
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:35,903
To the flanks!

215
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:15,002
Come on!

216
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,158
Thank my brother for his love!

217
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:26,573
I am the son of Roger de...

218
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:28,992
Take your helmet off
while addressing me.

219
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:40,420
I am the son of Roger de Cormier.

220
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:50,222
I am accorded
the privilege of... ransom.

221
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,475
This is true.

222
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:33,140
Well, you broke the arrow.

223
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:36,393
If the ribs are broken,

224
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:39,479
the marrow...
may enter the blood.

225
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:42,983
In which case,
you'll take a fever and die.

226
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:45,861
Or a cyst will form

227
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:47,905
and you'll live.

228
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:52,492
You're in the hands of God.

229
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,162
Get me some more wine.

230
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:10,469
It was not
that they had no right to take you.

231
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,679
It was the way they asked.

232
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,974
They had the right to take me.

233
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:20,103
And so do I.

234
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:39,164
To kill an infidel,

235
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,041
the Pope has said, is not murder.

236
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:42,834
It is the path to heaven.

237
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:47,214
To kill an infidel, the Pope has said,
is not murder.

238
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:49,841
It is the path to heaven.

239
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:51,802
Godfrey.

240
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:59,601
To kill an infidel, the Pope has said,
is not murder.

241
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:01,478
It is the path to heaven.

242
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:12,572
- Where do you go?
- To Jerusalem, brother.

243
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:15,701
- By which road?
- Someone knows.

244
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:18,328
God knows.

245
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:35,012
When shall we stop this madness?

246
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:37,472
It will soon be beyond my concern.

247
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:46,481
Who is this?

248
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:49,693
My son.

249
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:58,201
Would I had fought you when you were
still capable of making bastards!

250
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:03,457
I knew your mother
when she was making hers.

251
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:07,335
Fortunately, you're too old
to be one of mine.

252
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:11,214
All will be settled.

253
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,486
Do you know
what lies in the Holy Land?

254
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:17,906
A new world.

255
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:21,368
A man who in France
had not a house

256
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:24,079
is in the Holy Land
the master of a city.

257
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:27,916
He who was the master of a city
begs in the gutter.

258
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:33,880
There, at the end of the world,
you are not what you were born, but...

259
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:37,050
what you have
within yourself to be.

260
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:39,594
I hope to find forgiveness.

261
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:42,305
That's all I know.

262
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:49,604
Whatever your position,
you are of my house,

263
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:53,191
and that means you will serve
the King of Jerusalem.

264
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:56,361
What could a king ask
of a man like me?

265
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,866
A better world
than has ever been seen.

266
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:04,244
A kingdom of conscience.

267
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:07,372
A kingdom of heaven.

268
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:11,001
There is peace
between Christian and Muslim.

269
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:12,752
We live together.

270
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:16,882
Or, between Salah-al Din and the King,
we try.

271
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:20,969
Did you think that lay
at the end of crusade?

272
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:23,138
It does.

273
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:29,144
My son, you are all that survives me.
Do not disappoint me.

274
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:38,153
When we took the Holy Land,
we took the Saracen trading ports.

275
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:41,615
So Italian ships
carry silks and spices

276
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:44,618
and pilgrims, if they have money.

277
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,164
And Italy becomes rich,

278
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,291
as the Savior intended.

279
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:58,506
- Who are those men?
- Muslims.

280
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:01,468
Saracens.

281
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:05,305
- And they are allowed their prayers?
- If they pay the tax.

282
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:12,312
Praise be to God.
It is proper to praise Him.

283
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:14,940
It sounds like our prayers.

284
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:23,698
It's good!

285
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,376
When the King is dead,

286
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:38,755
Jerusalem will be no place
for friends of Muslims

287
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:41,007
or traitors to Christendom

288
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:42,717
like your father.

289
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,846
I am Guy de Lusignan.

290
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:49,808
Remember that name.

291
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:52,018
And me.

292
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:58,066
Keep it.

293
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:00,527
My lord!

294
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,782
How will you ride if you have
no stick to beat the horse?

295
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:11,746
He will be king
in Jerusalem one day.

296
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,722
Balian!

297
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:34,728
Hurry.

298
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:46,614
I can go no further.

299
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,334
Get on your knees.

300
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:23,360
Be without fear
in the face of your enemies.

301
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:26,279
Be brave and upright
that God may love thee.

302
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:30,784
Speak the truth always,
even if it leads to your death.

303
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:34,871
Safeguard the helpless
and do no wrong.

304
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:37,707
That is your oath.

305
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:48,802
And that's so you remember it.

306
00:39:57,311 --> 00:40:00,397
Arise a knight
and baron of Ibelin.

307
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:14,452
Defend the King.

308
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:19,416
If the King is no more,
protect the people.

309
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:25,964
It is time now, my lord,
to confess to Holy God, not your son.

310
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:29,175
Are you sorry for all your sins?

311
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:32,554
For all but one.

312
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:45,066
Per istam sanctam unctionem
et suam piissimam misericordiam,

313
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:48,945
adiuvet te Dominus
gratia Spiritus Sancti...

314
00:40:57,496 --> 00:41:00,331
You sail now for Jerusalem,
as your father wished.

315
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:02,041
I'll follow within the week.

316
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,419
Now, the voyage is perilous.

317
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:08,089
If God has purpose for you there,
He'll keep you safe in His hands.

318
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:10,508
If not,

319
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:14,053
God bless you.

320
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:11,314
Whoa... Whoa... Whoa...

321
00:44:36,131 --> 00:44:38,925
He says that is his horse!

322
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:41,094
Why would it be his horse?

323
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:43,262
Because it is on his land!

324
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:46,015
I took this horse from the sea!

325
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:58,111
He says, "You are a great liar!"

326
00:44:58,737 --> 00:45:01,239
And he will fight you
because you are a liar.

327
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:03,116
I have no desire to fight!

328
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:05,243
Then you must give him the horse!

329
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:12,500
No!

330
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:27,974
Fight me fairly!

331
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:31,728
Why? Why should he?
He is a knight!

332
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:33,771
And I am the baron of Ibelin!

333
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,906
He says the baron of Ibelin is old.

334
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:46,993
He knew him at Damascus.

335
00:45:47,786 --> 00:45:49,162
I am the new one.

336
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:01,215
Stop!

337
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:09,474
That's enough!

338
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:11,726
Stop!

339
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:17,523
Ibelin, that's enough!

340
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:20,067
Ibelin! No!

341
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,926
You've taken it very well
that I have killed your master.

342
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:46,719
It was the end of his time.

343
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:50,389
All is as God wills it.

344
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:56,437
Now finish this.

345
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:16,457
Take me to Jerusalem.

346
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:20,313
A very good horse.

347
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:24,025
Take the horse.

348
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:26,777
And be about your business.

349
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:29,947
This is your prize of battle.

350
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:33,492
I am your prisoner, your slave,
should you wish it.

351
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:36,412
I have been a slave
or very near to one.

352
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:39,457
I will never keep one
nor suffer any to be kept.

353
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:41,208
Go.

354
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:50,676
The man you killed

355
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:53,638
was a very great cavalier
among the Muslims.

356
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:57,350
- His name was Muhammad al Fais.
- I will pray for him.

357
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:01,562
Your quality will be known
among your enemies,

358
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:04,106
before ever you meet them,
my friend.

359
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:16,410
Old man,

360
00:49:17,162 --> 00:49:19,413
where is it
that Christ was crucified?

361
00:50:02,874 --> 00:50:03,916
(God,)

362
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:06,836
(what is it you want of me?)

363
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:46,375
(How can you be in hell,
when you're in my heart?)

364
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:32,296
You must have known him.

365
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:35,549
- What?
- Since you carry Godfrey's sword

366
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:37,635
you must have known him.

367
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:41,847
I did.

368
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:43,182
A man my size.

369
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:51,107
Yes.

370
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:52,983
And green eyes.

371
00:51:57,864 --> 00:51:58,948
Blue.

372
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:06,789
Come with us,

373
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:09,416
my lord.

374
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:33,274
No. No.

375
00:52:33,608 --> 00:52:34,859
Give me the towel.

376
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:37,278
Give me the towel.

377
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:39,113
Give me the towel.

378
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:13,772
A man who in France
had not a house

379
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:16,483
is in the Holy Land
the master of a city.

380
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:50,017
Stop!

381
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:51,810
You're hurting him.

382
00:53:53,146 --> 00:53:56,065
Whoa... Whoa...

383
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:15,000
Where's your master?

384
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:16,877
I have none.

385
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:21,006
Give me some water.

386
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:36,480
Thank you for the drink.

387
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:42,987
If you happen to see Balian,
the son of Godfrey,

388
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:45,447
tell him that Sibylla called.

389
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:59,336
So how find you Jerusalem?

390
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:01,797
God does not speak to me,

391
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:04,174
not even on the hill

392
00:55:05,218 --> 00:55:08,554
where Christ died.
I am outside God's grace.

393
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:10,681
I have not heard that.

394
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:12,141
At any rate,

395
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:13,726
it seems

396
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:16,562
I have lost my religion.

397
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:19,273
I put no stock in religion.

398
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:22,818
By the word "religion",
I've seen the lunacy of fanatics

399
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:25,612
of every denomination
be called the will of God.

400
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:29,491
I've seen too much religion
in the eyes of too many murderers.

401
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:32,202
Holiness

402
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:34,288
is in right action

403
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:38,083
and courage on behalf of those
who cannot defend themselves.

404
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:40,377
And goodness...

405
00:55:44,215 --> 00:55:45,591
What God desires

406
00:55:46,551 --> 00:55:47,676
is here

407
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:49,595
and here.

408
00:55:49,804 --> 00:55:53,140
By what you decide to do every day,
you will be a good man

409
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:56,018
or not.

410
00:55:58,355 --> 00:55:59,271
Come.

411
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:27,216
The King has made a peace
with Salah-al Din these past 6 years.

412
00:56:27,258 --> 00:56:30,677
He holds Jerusalem as a place
for prayer for all faiths,

413
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:33,013
as the Muslims
did before we came.

414
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:37,101
These men are Templars.
They killed Arabs.

415
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:48,028
So they are dying for what the Pope
would command them to do.

416
00:56:49,197 --> 00:56:50,239
Yes.

417
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:52,199
But not Christ, I think.

418
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:54,785
Nor this king.

419
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:10,843
- Who says I raid?
- That witness.

420
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:13,053
All of Jerusalem,

421
00:57:13,721 --> 00:57:14,888
holy God,

422
00:57:15,473 --> 00:57:16,515
and me!

423
00:57:17,058 --> 00:57:21,770
That witness, if you call him that,
is a Saracen. He lies.

424
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:24,440
There will come a day,
Reynald de Chatillon,

425
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:27,526
when you are not protected
by your title!

426
00:57:28,903 --> 00:57:30,112
When will that be?

427
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:34,700
Alert me, Tiberias, when men are equal
and the Kingdom of Heaven has arrived.

428
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:38,996
Those Templars have been hung
for a raid that I know you commanded!

429
00:57:40,206 --> 00:57:41,248
Prove it!

430
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:43,542
I will wait at Kerak until you do.

431
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:47,463
The King will take
your castle of Kerak, Reynald.

432
00:57:47,922 --> 00:57:49,465
Try to take it, Tiberias.

433
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:51,383
I'll be there!

434
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,557
You're letting him go?

435
00:57:58,683 --> 00:58:00,142
Why are you letting him go?

436
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:02,019
I cannot protect your caravans

437
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:04,646
unless you agree to be escorted
by our soldiers!

438
00:58:04,689 --> 00:58:09,485
I trade to make money, not to offend
God by associating with Christians!

439
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:11,820
But you will take Christian gold.

440
00:58:12,197 --> 00:58:13,489
Gold is gold.

441
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:17,242
Of course.

442
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:21,955
My lord Tiberias.

443
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:31,715
My lord.

444
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:36,386
It's true.

445
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,182
You're your father's son.

446
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:41,767
He was my friend.

447
00:58:42,393 --> 00:58:43,560
I am yours.

448
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:46,605
Godfrey dead...

449
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:49,775
It could have come at a better time.
Come!

450
00:58:51,402 --> 00:58:55,614
It was shouted in the streets
that you killed a great lord of Syria.

451
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:58,534
Salah-al Din himself sent word

452
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:01,620
that your fight
did not breach the peace,

453
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:07,459
that you had cause.
What know you of Salah-al Din?

454
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:11,296
That he is king of the Saracens
and that he surrounds this kingdom.

455
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:14,758
He has 200,000 men
in Damascus alone.

456
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:18,262
He could win a war
if he goes to war,

457
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:22,724
and he's daily given cause for war
by fanatics newly from Europe,

458
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:26,562
by Templar bastards
like Reynald de Chatillon.

459
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:30,691
Here from this room I keep the peace,
so far as it can be kept.

460
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:34,236
But Salah-al Din and the King,
between them,

461
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:37,489
would make a better world.

462
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:41,076
If it lives only for a while,
Tiberias, it still has lived.

463
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:49,876
What did your father tell you
of your... obligations?

464
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:52,504
That I was to be a good knight.

465
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:57,718
I pray
the world and Jerusalem

466
00:59:58,678 --> 01:00:01,263
can accommodate
such a rarity

467
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:04,766
as a perfect knight.

468
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:10,439
Have you dined?

469
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:23,076
The Princess Sibylla of Jerusalem
and her husband, Guy de Lusignan!

470
01:00:35,089 --> 01:00:39,343
- So, how many knights
did you find in France? - Fifty.

471
01:00:40,386 --> 01:00:42,429
They've sworn allegiance
to the King?

472
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:44,431
Of course, Tiberias.

473
01:00:44,849 --> 01:00:45,891
Obviously.

474
01:00:51,397 --> 01:00:52,981
You sit at my table!

475
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:55,442
Is it not the King's table?

476
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:58,320
Is it? I have not seen a king at it
for some years.

477
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:02,908
I cannot eat.
I... am finicky about company.

478
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:07,079
In France,
this could not inherit.

479
01:01:07,372 --> 01:01:12,709
But here there are no civilized rules.
I have business in the East.

480
01:01:15,588 --> 01:01:19,424
My wife does not lament
at my absences.

481
01:01:19,926 --> 01:01:22,260
That is
either the best of wives

482
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:24,846
or the very, very worst.

483
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:29,935
- Do you go to meet Reynald?
- No, my lord. He is in disfavor!

484
01:01:30,061 --> 01:01:31,770
I am a member of this court!

485
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:35,941
Why should I make league
with that... troublemaker?

486
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:45,534
To the very best of wives!

487
01:01:46,327 --> 01:01:47,786
God bless Jerusalem.

488
01:01:49,914 --> 01:01:53,542
- The King will see him now.
- The King would see Godfrey's son.

489
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:55,836
I'll take him.

490
01:01:57,380 --> 01:02:00,132
This morning I spoke
without knowing who you were.

491
01:02:00,633 --> 01:02:02,050
I knew who you were.

492
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:04,845
It's unmistakable.

493
01:02:05,346 --> 01:02:06,680
I loved your father.

494
01:02:08,057 --> 01:02:09,474
And I shall love you.

495
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:15,230
Do you fear being with me?

496
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:17,274
No.

497
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:20,610
And yes.

498
01:02:23,531 --> 01:02:26,032
A woman in my place
has two faces:

499
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:30,829
one for the world
and one which she wears in private.

500
01:02:31,664 --> 01:02:33,540
With you, I'll be only Sibylla.

501
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:41,923
Tiberias thinks me unpredictable.

502
01:02:42,633 --> 01:02:44,760
I am... unpredictable.

503
01:02:48,681 --> 01:02:50,223
No. There.

504
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:06,782
Come forward.

505
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:09,659
I am glad to meet Godfrey's son.

506
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,788
He was one of my greatest teachers.

507
01:03:14,332 --> 01:03:17,876
He was there when, playing
with the other boys, my arm was cut

508
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:20,420
and it was he,
not my father's physicians,

509
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:22,297
who noticed that I felt no pain.

510
01:03:24,133 --> 01:03:26,718
He wept when he gave my father
the news

511
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:29,805
that I am a leper.

512
01:03:32,975 --> 01:03:34,226
The Saracens say

513
01:03:34,685 --> 01:03:38,730
that this disease is God's vengeance
against the vanity of our kingdom.

514
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:41,525
As wretched as I am

515
01:03:41,943 --> 01:03:44,444
these Arabs believe
that the chastisement

516
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:47,781
that awaits me in hell
is far more severe and lasting.

517
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:52,244
If that's true,
I call it unfair.

518
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:56,540
Come, sit.

519
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:01,294
- Do you play?
- No.

520
01:04:01,754 --> 01:04:03,421
The whole world is in chess.

521
01:04:04,882 --> 01:04:06,800
Any move can be
the death of you.

522
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:11,137
Do anything
except remain where you started

523
01:04:11,597 --> 01:04:13,640
and you can't be sure of your end.

524
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:16,142
Were you sure of your end once?

525
01:04:17,895 --> 01:04:19,729
- I was.
- What was it?

526
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,943
To be buried 100 yards
from where I was born.

527
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:27,070
And now?

528
01:04:27,321 --> 01:04:30,448
Now I sit in Jerusalem
and look upon a king.

529
01:04:35,329 --> 01:04:37,497
When I was 16,
I won a great victory.

530
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,501
I felt in that moment
I would live to be 100.

531
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:45,088
Now I know I shall not see 30.

532
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:49,718
None of us know our end, really.

533
01:04:50,595 --> 01:04:53,138
Or what hand will guide us there.

534
01:04:54,515 --> 01:04:57,267
A king may move a man.

535
01:04:57,894 --> 01:04:59,519
A father may claim a son.

536
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:02,314
That man can also move himself.

537
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:06,526
And only then does that man
truly begin his own game.

538
01:05:08,029 --> 01:05:11,281
Remember that howsoever
you are played or by whom,

539
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:13,575
your soul
is in your keeping alone.

540
01:05:14,493 --> 01:05:18,288
Even though those who presume
to play you be kings or men of power,

541
01:05:19,123 --> 01:05:21,541
when you stand before God,
you cannot say:

542
01:05:22,877 --> 01:05:25,128
"But I was told
by others to do thus"

543
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:31,176
or that "virtue was not convenient
at the time." This will not suffice.

544
01:05:32,303 --> 01:05:33,428
Remember that.

545
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:36,806
I will.

546
01:05:39,518 --> 01:05:40,852
You know what this is?

547
01:05:41,854 --> 01:05:44,439
- The fortification.
- What do you think of it?

548
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,985
You disapprove.
Well, how would you improve it?

549
01:05:49,403 --> 01:05:50,445
A cross,

550
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:52,781
or better, a star,

551
01:05:53,532 --> 01:05:54,574
like this.

552
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:56,952
That way, no part of the fortress
may be approached

553
01:05:56,994 --> 01:05:59,788
without being exposed
to fire from another part.

554
01:05:59,830 --> 01:06:03,041
Yes, I like this. Your walls
are more difficult to address!

555
01:06:06,045 --> 01:06:07,087
Very good.

556
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:09,965
You will go
to your father's house at Ibelin,

557
01:06:10,299 --> 01:06:11,549
your house now.

558
01:06:12,009 --> 01:06:14,970
And then from there,
you will protect the pilgrim road.

559
01:06:15,179 --> 01:06:18,098
Safeguard in particular
the Jews and the Muslims.

560
01:06:18,766 --> 01:06:20,809
All are welcome in Jerusalem.

561
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:24,813
Not only because it's expedient,
but because it is right.

562
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:29,943
Protect the helpless.
And then maybe one day,

563
01:06:30,194 --> 01:06:33,029
when I am helpless,
you will come and protect me.

564
01:07:56,405 --> 01:07:57,572
There, my lord.

565
01:07:58,949 --> 01:07:59,991
Ibelin.

566
01:08:52,586 --> 01:08:53,878
Quod sumus

567
01:08:56,465 --> 01:08:57,757
hoc eritis.

568
01:08:59,552 --> 01:09:02,595
Such as we are...
you will be.

569
01:09:36,463 --> 01:09:38,089
Your father was important.

570
01:09:39,925 --> 01:09:41,342
His lands were not.

571
01:09:42,887 --> 01:09:44,137
It will suit me.

572
01:09:49,643 --> 01:09:53,438
My lord, you have 1,000 acres,
100 families.

573
01:09:55,482 --> 01:09:58,151
You have Christians,
Jews, Muslims.

574
01:09:58,611 --> 01:10:00,320
You have 50 pairs of oxen.

575
01:10:00,696 --> 01:10:02,572
This is a poor and dusty place.

576
01:10:03,991 --> 01:10:07,160
What we do not have...
is water.

577
01:11:14,645 --> 01:11:15,603
All right.

578
01:11:15,729 --> 01:11:16,980
Stone the walls.

579
01:12:16,665 --> 01:12:18,082
I'm on my way to Cana,

580
01:12:22,629 --> 01:12:24,714
where Jesus changed water to wine.

581
01:12:26,425 --> 01:12:29,469
But a better trick
would be to change you to a nobleman.

582
01:12:29,511 --> 01:12:30,678
That should be easy.

583
01:12:30,971 --> 01:12:33,806
In France, a few yards of silk
can make a nobleman.

584
01:12:35,726 --> 01:12:37,518
I expect your hospitality.

585
01:12:38,437 --> 01:12:39,562
It is given.

586
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:31,090
But this isn't adultery.
It's washing.

587
01:14:36,638 --> 01:14:38,181
But if it were adultery,

588
01:14:38,807 --> 01:14:39,891
which it isn't,

589
01:14:40,434 --> 01:14:42,977
the Commandments
are not for people like us.

590
01:14:43,854 --> 01:14:45,313
They are for the others.

591
01:14:46,732 --> 01:14:48,733
Did they give you something to eat?

592
01:14:49,651 --> 01:14:51,986
I said to wait
until the master returned.

593
01:14:55,073 --> 01:14:57,617
My cook will prepare something
while you wash.

594
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:26,812
- What? - It seems years
since I've seen a woman eat.

595
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:29,232
Truly?

596
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:34,779
I was watching you today.

597
01:15:35,906 --> 01:15:38,616
You've been given a patch of dirt,
and it seems

598
01:15:39,493 --> 01:15:41,661
you will build
a new Jerusalem here.

599
01:15:42,621 --> 01:15:43,788
It is my land.

600
01:15:46,667 --> 01:15:49,418
Who would I be
if I did not try to make it better?

601
01:16:05,894 --> 01:16:07,311
They try to be one:

602
01:16:08,272 --> 01:16:12,066
one heart, one morality.

603
01:16:12,943 --> 01:16:14,694
Their prophet says, "Submit."

604
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:16,821
Jesus says,

605
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:20,366
"Decide."

606
01:16:21,827 --> 01:16:23,244
Did you decide on Guy?

607
01:16:26,915 --> 01:16:28,708
Guy was chosen by my mother.

608
01:16:29,042 --> 01:16:31,877
My first husband died
before our son was born.

609
01:16:33,255 --> 01:16:34,589
I was only 15.

610
01:16:37,134 --> 01:16:38,509
I've met your son.

611
01:18:21,029 --> 01:18:22,613
I could stay here forever.

612
01:18:23,949 --> 01:18:25,282
This house is yours.

613
01:18:26,576 --> 01:18:28,160
Why do you think I'm here?

614
01:18:39,673 --> 01:18:42,174
I know that Ibelin
is not on the way to Cana.

615
01:18:43,051 --> 01:18:44,802
What else do you know, my lord?

616
01:18:45,387 --> 01:18:47,138
I know that you are a princess.

617
01:18:48,598 --> 01:18:49,890
And I am no lord.

618
01:18:50,392 --> 01:18:51,475
You're a knight.

619
01:18:52,102 --> 01:18:54,645
Neither earned... nor proved.

620
01:19:00,152 --> 01:19:03,738
I'm not here with you
because I'm... bored

621
01:19:04,448 --> 01:19:05,740
or wicked.

622
01:19:06,324 --> 01:19:07,658
I'm here because

623
01:19:09,911 --> 01:19:12,872
in the East,
between one person and another,

624
01:19:14,791 --> 01:19:16,125
there is only light.

625
01:20:29,366 --> 01:20:30,658
Hold!

626
01:20:35,163 --> 01:20:39,208
- This caravan is armed, Reynald.
- Good! No sport otherwise!

627
01:20:40,877 --> 01:20:42,086
They've seen us.

628
01:20:43,588 --> 01:20:45,673
Go after them.
A rider's getting away.

629
01:20:45,715 --> 01:20:48,175
It's a broad desert.
Nothing'll come of it. Nothing.

630
01:20:48,218 --> 01:20:50,845
I prefer not to be hanged
before my wife is queen.

631
01:20:51,054 --> 01:20:52,096
Don't worry.

632
01:20:52,138 --> 01:20:53,681
"Who but Reynald?" they'll say.

633
01:20:54,349 --> 01:20:55,599
It's always me.

634
01:20:55,642 --> 01:20:58,018
They'll believe it in Jerusalem,
I assure you.

635
01:20:58,061 --> 01:20:59,728
You were at Nazareth, praying.

636
01:21:00,605 --> 01:21:02,273
You're a dangerous man, Reynald.

637
01:21:02,315 --> 01:21:04,984
If the war's to be now or later,
I would have it now.

638
01:21:05,277 --> 01:21:08,737
- How long can the leper last?
- God wills it!

639
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:10,447
God wills it!

640
01:21:10,490 --> 01:21:13,742
- Jerusalem!
- Charge!

641
01:21:41,897 --> 01:21:43,063
It's you!

642
01:22:22,145 --> 01:22:23,479
This is from France.

643
01:22:24,230 --> 01:22:25,606
I've never been there.

644
01:22:26,399 --> 01:22:27,942
This is from my brother.

645
01:22:28,860 --> 01:22:30,736
This is to remind us of death.

646
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:32,863
And this

647
01:22:35,575 --> 01:22:37,368
I bought the day I saw you.

648
01:22:40,413 --> 01:22:41,497
You lie.

649
01:23:10,443 --> 01:23:11,652
Guy de Lusignan

650
01:23:12,028 --> 01:23:14,697
and Reynald de Chatillon,
with the Templars,

651
01:23:14,739 --> 01:23:17,616
have attacked a Saracen caravan.
- Liar!

652
01:23:20,078 --> 01:23:21,328
Silence!

653
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:23,330
It was no caravan.

654
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:27,710
It was an army headed for Bethlehem
to desecrate the birthplace of Our Lord!

655
01:23:27,919 --> 01:23:32,006
Reynald, with the Templars, have
broken the King's pledge of peace!

656
01:23:32,298 --> 01:23:34,675
Salah-al Din will come
into this kingdom...

657
01:23:34,718 --> 01:23:38,929
Tiberias knows more than a Christian
should about Salah-al Din's intentions.

658
01:23:43,518 --> 01:23:45,436
That I would rather live with men

659
01:23:45,895 --> 01:23:47,146
than kill them

660
01:23:48,356 --> 01:23:50,524
is certainly why you are alive.

661
01:23:50,859 --> 01:23:54,528
That sort of Christianity
has its uses, I suppose.

662
01:23:54,779 --> 01:23:57,114
We must not go to war
with Salah-al Din!

663
01:23:58,241 --> 01:23:59,616
We do not want it!

664
01:23:59,784 --> 01:24:05,372
- And we may not win it!
- Blasphemy! - Blasphemy! - Blasphemy!

665
01:24:06,458 --> 01:24:09,251
An army of Jesus Christ
which bears His holy cross

666
01:24:09,294 --> 01:24:10,377
cannot be beaten.

667
01:24:10,962 --> 01:24:13,839
Does the count of Tiberias
suggest that it could be?

668
01:24:14,174 --> 01:24:15,424
There must be war.

669
01:24:15,633 --> 01:24:17,718
- God wills it!
- God wills it!

670
01:24:17,927 --> 01:24:19,636
God wills it!

671
01:24:33,568 --> 01:24:35,152
Silence!

672
01:24:44,329 --> 01:24:48,207
Salah-al Din has crossed the Jordan
with 200,000 men.

673
01:24:49,709 --> 01:24:54,046
He will make first for Kerak
and Reynald de Chatillon. My lord...

674
01:25:02,097 --> 01:25:04,807
We must meet him
before he reaches Kerak.

675
01:25:06,142 --> 01:25:07,601
I will lead the army.

676
01:25:08,728 --> 01:25:10,354
My lord, if you travel,

677
01:25:11,231 --> 01:25:12,397
you'll die.

678
01:25:12,899 --> 01:25:15,818
Send word to Balian
to protect the villagers.

679
01:25:18,613 --> 01:25:19,988
Assemble the army!

680
01:25:40,510 --> 01:25:41,844
What becomes of us?

681
01:25:44,264 --> 01:25:45,722
The world will decide.

682
01:25:47,684 --> 01:25:49,434
The world always decides.

683
01:26:09,372 --> 01:26:10,414
My lord!

684
01:26:10,623 --> 01:26:12,332
The King is marching on Kerak!

685
01:26:36,983 --> 01:26:38,275
Saracen cavalry!

686
01:26:38,651 --> 01:26:40,652
They're coming to close Reynald in!

687
01:26:40,737 --> 01:26:43,030
These people are not safe
outside the walls!

688
01:26:43,156 --> 01:26:45,657
Salah-al Din will certainly come
behind them!

689
01:27:00,089 --> 01:27:01,757
Go into the fortress now.

690
01:27:33,748 --> 01:27:34,831
Visitors!

691
01:27:45,802 --> 01:27:46,885
My lord Balian!

692
01:27:48,846 --> 01:27:50,055
My lord Balian!

693
01:27:52,058 --> 01:27:55,018
My lord Reynald prays
you bring your force into Kerak!

694
01:27:55,061 --> 01:27:57,896
Thank you, but no.
If we do, these people will die.

695
01:27:58,481 --> 01:28:01,358
We'll hold the Saracen cavalry
until the King arrives.

696
01:28:02,527 --> 01:28:03,568
So be it.

697
01:28:08,366 --> 01:28:10,450
We cannot attack that
and live.

698
01:28:13,496 --> 01:28:14,663
My lady.

699
01:28:16,833 --> 01:28:18,000
What do you look at?

700
01:28:18,751 --> 01:28:19,793
A knight...

701
01:28:22,171 --> 01:28:23,338
His men...

702
01:28:31,431 --> 01:28:32,472
Are you with me?

703
01:29:30,156 --> 01:29:32,074
Forward!

704
01:29:40,958 --> 01:29:43,001
Divide!

705
01:31:46,834 --> 01:31:49,419
Your quality will be known
among your enemies

706
01:31:49,921 --> 01:31:52,088
before ever you meet them,
my friend.

707
01:31:56,594 --> 01:31:59,346
- You were not that man's servant.
- No.

708
01:32:00,223 --> 01:32:01,556
He was my servant.

709
01:32:11,442 --> 01:32:14,277
- And what becomes of us?
- As you deserve.

710
01:32:15,696 --> 01:32:17,489
You reap what you sow.

711
01:32:18,741 --> 01:32:20,825
You have heard of this, no?

712
01:32:22,578 --> 01:32:23,620
Get up.

713
01:32:37,969 --> 01:32:39,511
You may go into Kerak.

714
01:32:40,471 --> 01:32:41,930
But you will die there.

715
01:32:43,015 --> 01:32:44,391
My master is here.

716
01:33:05,329 --> 01:33:08,331
Tell my lord Salah-al Din
that Jerusalem has come.

717
01:34:10,478 --> 01:34:11,728
Salah-al Din...

718
01:34:34,919 --> 01:34:38,588
I pray you'll pull back your cavalry
and leave this matter to me.

719
01:34:39,757 --> 01:34:42,384
I pray
you'll retire unharmed to Damascus.

720
01:34:44,220 --> 01:34:46,346
Reynald of Chatillon
will be punished.

721
01:34:47,264 --> 01:34:48,390
I swear it.

722
01:34:49,308 --> 01:34:51,351
Withdraw or we will all die here.

723
01:35:04,490 --> 01:35:05,699
Do we have terms?

724
01:35:10,287 --> 01:35:11,579
We have terms.

725
01:35:19,755 --> 01:35:22,590
I will... send you my physicians.

726
01:35:48,993 --> 01:35:50,702
I am Reynald of Chatillon!

727
01:36:32,286 --> 01:36:33,661
On your knees.

728
01:36:36,791 --> 01:36:37,916
Lower.

729
01:36:41,545 --> 01:36:42,587
I...

730
01:36:43,589 --> 01:36:44,964
am Jerusalem.

731
01:36:46,801 --> 01:36:49,594
And you, Reynald,

732
01:36:50,429 --> 01:36:52,472
will give me the kiss of peace.

733
01:37:12,201 --> 01:37:13,326
Guard!

734
01:37:22,002 --> 01:37:24,254
- What are you looking at?
- A dead man.

735
01:37:25,381 --> 01:37:26,756
Reynald of Chatillon,

736
01:37:27,132 --> 01:37:29,092
you are arrested
and condemned.

737
01:37:47,611 --> 01:37:49,362
If you continue like this,

738
01:37:50,155 --> 01:37:52,282
I shall have to find
a use for you.

739
01:37:52,741 --> 01:37:54,701
If God can spare you, that is.

740
01:37:55,494 --> 01:37:56,995
God does not know me.

741
01:37:57,913 --> 01:37:59,038
Yes, but I do.

742
01:38:22,771 --> 01:38:24,314
I need you in Jerusalem.

743
01:42:02,199 --> 01:42:03,533
Why did we retire?

744
01:42:06,328 --> 01:42:07,370
Why?

745
01:42:08,539 --> 01:42:10,039
God did not favor him.

746
01:42:10,582 --> 01:42:13,209
And God alone determines
the results of battles.

747
01:42:13,293 --> 01:42:15,878
The results of battles
are determined by God,

748
01:42:16,171 --> 01:42:17,839
but also by preparation,

749
01:42:18,382 --> 01:42:19,423
numbers,

750
01:42:19,633 --> 01:42:22,760
the absence of disease
and the availability of water.

751
01:42:23,971 --> 01:42:26,889
One cannot maintain a siege
with the enemy behind.

752
01:42:27,724 --> 01:42:31,352
How many battles did God win
for the Muslims before I came?

753
01:42:32,312 --> 01:42:33,479
That is

754
01:42:34,189 --> 01:42:36,649
before God determined
that I should come.

755
01:42:37,943 --> 01:42:39,026
Few enough.

756
01:42:41,655 --> 01:42:43,406
That's because we were sinful.

757
01:42:45,993 --> 01:42:49,036
It is because you were unprepared.

758
01:42:49,538 --> 01:42:52,415
If you think that way,
you shall not be king for long.

759
01:42:58,714 --> 01:43:01,883
When I am not king,
I quake for Islam.

760
01:43:03,844 --> 01:43:05,553
Thank you for your visit.

761
01:43:09,892 --> 01:43:12,143
Thank you for your visit.

762
01:43:17,691 --> 01:43:18,816
You promised.

763
01:43:20,110 --> 01:43:22,195
You promised to return Jerusalem.

764
01:43:25,157 --> 01:43:26,240
Don't forget.

765
01:43:42,341 --> 01:43:45,301
If I do not deliver war,
I have no peace.

766
01:43:46,178 --> 01:43:48,221
The King of Jerusalem will die soon.

767
01:43:48,889 --> 01:43:52,642
When he is dead, the boy will become
king of a kingdom he cannot control.

768
01:43:53,435 --> 01:43:57,355
The Christians
will make the war you need.

769
01:44:01,693 --> 01:44:02,944
Move on!

770
01:44:03,904 --> 01:44:05,154
Forward!

771
01:44:57,165 --> 01:45:00,167
I am Reynald de Chatillon!

772
01:45:03,171 --> 01:45:06,757
I am Reynald de Chatillon!

773
01:45:07,926 --> 01:45:10,428
Reynald de Chatillon!

774
01:45:12,347 --> 01:45:14,473
I... am

775
01:45:16,351 --> 01:45:18,769
Reynald de Chatillon!

776
01:45:20,731 --> 01:45:26,694
The things that we have left undone
plague us as death comes.

777
01:45:27,612 --> 01:45:29,280
That is why, to the dying

778
01:45:29,865 --> 01:45:34,285
there is no comfort but the Lord.
- Spare me your sermon.

779
01:45:35,829 --> 01:45:39,081
Go and prepare your people
for the coronation of my nephew.

780
01:45:42,044 --> 01:45:44,003
Your confession, my lord.

781
01:45:44,796 --> 01:45:47,173
I shall confess to God
when I see Him.

782
01:45:50,844 --> 01:45:51,927
Not to you.

783
01:45:54,556 --> 01:45:55,806
Now leave me.

784
01:46:42,312 --> 01:46:45,106
You sometimes dream
you are my wife.

785
01:46:46,066 --> 01:46:47,983
Let's pretend you are.

786
01:47:26,523 --> 01:47:27,731
I must go...

787
01:47:33,280 --> 01:47:34,905
We can't meet in the city.

788
01:47:36,324 --> 01:47:37,700
Then we will leave it.

789
01:47:39,369 --> 01:47:42,329
And live how? Live where?

790
01:47:42,998 --> 01:47:44,165
Balian,

791
01:47:45,667 --> 01:47:47,042
my brother's dying.

792
01:47:48,253 --> 01:47:50,880
My son will be king
and I his regent.

793
01:47:51,465 --> 01:47:52,882
I must rule for him.

794
01:47:53,967 --> 01:48:00,014
And not just in Jerusalem,
but Acre, Ascalon, Beirut.

795
01:48:02,434 --> 01:48:03,517
And Guy?

796
01:48:32,506 --> 01:48:35,966
Always surround your knights
with foot soldiers.

797
01:48:39,346 --> 01:48:40,971
These rooms are not yours.

798
01:48:44,601 --> 01:48:48,020
One day I will be the husband
I was commissioned to be.

799
01:48:48,939 --> 01:48:51,148
And perhaps not, my dear.

800
01:48:52,150 --> 01:48:56,445
Your lover has 100 knights
and the love of the King;

801
01:48:56,571 --> 01:48:59,657
I the largest force
in the kingdom

802
01:49:00,033 --> 01:49:02,076
and the support of the Templars.

803
01:49:03,036 --> 01:49:05,287
I can do
without the King's affection.

804
01:49:06,456 --> 01:49:08,123
But as for your love...

805
01:49:18,134 --> 01:49:20,427
Then we must come
to an understanding.

806
01:49:21,429 --> 01:49:26,392
You need my knights,
or his rule will be bloody and brief.

807
01:49:40,323 --> 01:49:42,074
So, my friend,

808
01:49:42,742 --> 01:49:45,119
the time has come
to conclude my affairs.

809
01:49:46,329 --> 01:49:48,205
If I leave the army with Guy,

810
01:49:48,373 --> 01:49:52,001
he will take power through my sister
and make war on the Muslims.

811
01:49:52,127 --> 01:49:55,963
We have decided that you shall take
command of the army of Jerusalem.

812
01:49:57,340 --> 01:50:00,759
Will you defend my nephew
when he's king?

813
01:50:02,721 --> 01:50:04,054
Whatever you ask

814
01:50:04,514 --> 01:50:07,391
I will serve.
- No, hear it all before you answer.

815
01:50:10,228 --> 01:50:14,356
Would you marry my sister Sibylla
were she free of Guy de Lusignan?

816
01:50:16,860 --> 01:50:17,901
And Guy?

817
01:50:19,279 --> 01:50:20,738
He will be executed

818
01:50:22,324 --> 01:50:25,534
along with his knights
who do not swear your allegiance.

819
01:50:29,456 --> 01:50:32,833
- I cannot be the cause of that.
- Whatever you ask

820
01:50:34,419 --> 01:50:35,711
I will serve.

821
01:50:39,758 --> 01:50:42,259
A king may move a man, you said,

822
01:50:44,012 --> 01:50:46,513
but the soul belongs to the man.

823
01:50:48,642 --> 01:50:49,933
Yes, I did.

824
01:50:51,436 --> 01:50:54,021
You have my love...
and my answer.

825
01:50:57,484 --> 01:50:58,651
So be it.

826
01:51:00,153 --> 01:51:01,695
Why do you protect Guy?

827
01:51:02,489 --> 01:51:04,156
He's a man who insults you,

828
01:51:04,699 --> 01:51:05,824
who hates you,

829
01:51:06,076 --> 01:51:08,744
who would kill you himself
if he had the chance.

830
01:51:09,329 --> 01:51:13,499
But for the salvation of this kingdom,
would it be so hard

831
01:51:14,834 --> 01:51:16,251
to marry Sibylla?

832
01:51:17,587 --> 01:51:22,633
- Jerusalem has no need
of a perfect knight. - No.

833
01:51:23,593 --> 01:51:25,511
It is a kingdom of conscience

834
01:51:26,680 --> 01:51:27,763
or nothing.

835
01:51:46,783 --> 01:51:47,825
Sibylla!

836
01:52:01,548 --> 01:52:03,298
Who are you to refuse a king?

837
01:52:04,259 --> 01:52:07,594
I will have power
without Guy or with him.

838
01:52:08,179 --> 01:52:10,889
Guy isn't dead at your say so
or my brother's,

839
01:52:11,224 --> 01:52:12,433
but at mine.

840
01:52:15,145 --> 01:52:18,355
Do you have any idea of Jerusalem
except that it is yours?

841
01:52:18,481 --> 01:52:21,358
You will never hold it in peace
as your brother did.

842
01:52:22,110 --> 01:52:23,193
It will be war.

843
01:52:24,070 --> 01:52:26,655
My grandfather
took Jerusalem in blood.

844
01:52:27,407 --> 01:52:30,075
I'll keep it the same way,
or any way I can.

845
01:52:31,202 --> 01:52:32,703
I am what I am.

846
01:52:33,747 --> 01:52:35,289
I offer you that

847
01:52:36,499 --> 01:52:38,041
and the world.

848
01:52:44,841 --> 01:52:46,049
You say no.

849
01:52:48,636 --> 01:52:50,262
Do you think I'm like Guy?

850
01:52:51,389 --> 01:52:53,015
That I would sell my soul?

851
01:53:01,858 --> 01:53:02,941
There'll be a day

852
01:53:03,985 --> 01:53:06,612
when you will wish
you had done a little evil

853
01:53:06,905 --> 01:53:08,530
to do a greater good.

854
01:53:15,705 --> 01:53:16,747
Reynald.

855
01:53:25,381 --> 01:53:26,423
My lord.

856
01:54:07,549 --> 01:54:09,258
Do you really think
that the King

857
01:54:09,300 --> 01:54:11,635
wants you head of the army
once he's gone?

858
01:54:15,306 --> 01:54:16,682
Think your wife does?

859
01:54:22,564 --> 01:54:26,567
- I have a problem.
- Ah, yes. Balian.

860
01:54:27,318 --> 01:54:28,610
I saw him at Kerak.

861
01:54:30,655 --> 01:54:31,822
Celebrated.

862
01:54:33,533 --> 01:54:36,618
You must beware a popular man.

863
01:54:37,912 --> 01:54:38,996
Kill him.

864
01:54:46,546 --> 01:54:48,255
- What's that?
- England.

865
01:54:48,631 --> 01:54:51,967
- The king?
- Richard. And his father was Henry.

866
01:54:52,093 --> 01:54:53,176
Good.

867
01:54:53,428 --> 01:54:56,388
- And that?
- France. Will I ever see France?

868
01:54:57,098 --> 01:54:59,850
Maybe one day.
But you must be king here.

869
01:55:02,186 --> 01:55:04,229
How many islands
can you see here?

870
01:55:05,940 --> 01:55:08,567
- One, two, three...
- The King will see you.

871
01:55:08,651 --> 01:55:09,735
No, I can't.

872
01:55:10,445 --> 01:55:12,821
I can't bear to look at him.
He knows this.

873
01:55:14,198 --> 01:55:16,199
It doesn't mean I don't love him.

874
01:55:17,035 --> 01:55:18,410
Go, madam.

875
01:56:58,636 --> 01:56:59,678
Hello.

876
01:57:01,347 --> 01:57:02,389
Hello.

877
01:57:03,391 --> 01:57:04,766
I was dreaming.

878
01:57:06,144 --> 01:57:07,936
I was back in that summer

879
01:57:09,397 --> 01:57:11,481
when I defeated Salah-al Din.

880
01:57:12,483 --> 01:57:13,692
Do you remember it?

881
01:57:15,194 --> 01:57:16,737
I was only 16.

882
01:57:17,864 --> 01:57:21,283
- You were a beautiful boy.
- Yes.

883
01:57:21,451 --> 01:57:23,243
You've always been beautiful,

884
01:57:25,788 --> 01:57:27,080
in every way.

885
01:57:30,543 --> 01:57:32,335
My beautiful sister...

886
01:57:33,504 --> 01:57:34,796
I've missed you.

887
01:57:35,965 --> 01:57:37,299
So beautiful...

888
01:57:39,635 --> 01:57:42,012
I'm sorry
if I've caused you any pain.

889
01:57:45,641 --> 01:57:47,309
Remember me as I was.

890
01:57:50,313 --> 01:57:51,438
I will.

891
01:58:43,366 --> 01:58:44,491
Sibylla!

892
01:58:59,674 --> 01:59:01,550
If my son has your knights,

893
01:59:05,429 --> 01:59:06,930
you have your wife.

One may stare into the light
until one becomes the light.

902
02:01:07,385 --> 02:01:08,969
I've done it many times.

903
02:01:16,644 --> 02:01:18,019
There's your religion!

904
02:01:18,562 --> 02:01:19,604
One spark.

905
02:01:20,356 --> 02:01:21,648
A creosote bush.

906
02:01:24,652 --> 02:01:26,069
There's your Moses!

907
02:01:26,988 --> 02:01:28,488
I did not hear it speak.

908
02:01:28,990 --> 02:01:31,074
It does not mean
that there is no God.

909
02:01:33,077 --> 02:01:34,369
Do you love her?

910
02:01:35,121 --> 02:01:36,288
Yes.

911
02:01:36,580 --> 02:01:39,958
Your heart will mend.
Your duty is to the people of the city.

912
02:01:41,752 --> 02:01:42,919
I go to pray.

913
02:01:43,421 --> 02:01:44,462
For what?

914
02:01:47,758 --> 02:01:50,677
For the strength
to endure what is to come.

915
02:01:51,345 --> 02:01:52,679
And what is to come?

916
02:01:53,431 --> 02:01:56,766
The reckoning is to come
for what was done 100 years before.

917
02:01:57,435 --> 02:01:59,477
The Muslims will never forget.

918
02:02:04,108 --> 02:02:05,400
Nor should they.

919
02:02:37,141 --> 02:02:39,976
My lady,
your letter to Salah-al Din...

920
02:02:40,353 --> 02:02:42,771
Peace to be sustained,
borders respected,

921
02:02:42,813 --> 02:02:48,610
trade allowed to continue.
Is this wise to show your intentions?

922
02:02:48,694 --> 02:02:51,154
Better, surely, to let him wonder.

923
02:02:52,073 --> 02:02:53,740
We keep my brother's peace.

924
02:02:54,075 --> 02:02:55,200
Sign.

925
02:03:07,129 --> 02:03:08,213
Take the seal.

926
02:03:12,009 --> 02:03:13,259
Be careful.

927
02:03:25,272 --> 02:03:26,981
Put it back, my darling.

928
02:03:41,747 --> 02:03:43,039
Hey!

929
02:04:14,530 --> 02:04:15,738
There is a rumor.

930
02:04:17,575 --> 02:04:19,325
We must condemn it immediately.

931
02:04:20,619 --> 02:04:21,786
Call it treason.

932
02:04:22,830 --> 02:04:26,291
- And kill those who whisper it.
- The rumor will die

933
02:04:26,959 --> 02:04:29,169
if we show the boy as active.

934
02:04:32,256 --> 02:04:34,174
How long before he wears a mask?

935
02:04:37,178 --> 02:04:39,012
Will you have one made for him?

936
02:04:40,598 --> 02:04:44,350
How did my boy deserve it?

937
02:04:48,814 --> 02:04:50,899
Jerusalem is dead, Tiberias.

938
02:04:53,944 --> 02:04:56,404
No kingdom
is worth my son alive in hell.

939
02:04:59,533 --> 02:05:01,284
I will go to hell instead.

940
02:05:25,142 --> 02:05:28,144
- Do you remember the story of Louan?
- No.

941
02:05:28,354 --> 02:05:32,232
- No? Do you remember why?
- No.

942
02:05:32,816 --> 02:05:36,194
And he was so lonely that

943
02:05:37,321 --> 02:05:39,948
he called all the gods.
- Why?

944
02:05:40,115 --> 02:05:43,159
Because he was desperate.
As a proof of love.

That is what I do.

Behold your rightful Queen and heir

I, Sibylla, by the grace
of the Holy Spirit,

02:08:42,172 --> 02:08:45,383
choose as King
Guy de Lusignan,

the man who has been my husband.

With the help of God,
he will rule his people well.

Long live the King!
Long live the King!

Long live the King!

I am what I am.

973
02:09:31,013 --> 02:09:32,472
Someone has to be.

974
02:09:57,456 --> 02:09:58,956
Salah-al Din's sister.

975
02:10:00,959 --> 02:10:02,126
I know.

976
02:10:22,606 --> 02:10:23,689
I know.

977
02:10:51,301 --> 02:10:52,718
Speak.

978
02:10:58,600 --> 02:11:01,394
The Sultan demands
the return of his sister's body,

979
02:11:01,436 --> 02:11:05,022
the heads of those responsible,
and the surrender of Jerusalem.

980

Does he?

981
02:11:13,574 --> 02:11:15,908
What answer
do you return to Salah-al Din?

982

This.

983
02:11:46,273 --> 02:11:48,190
Take the head to Damascus.

984
02:11:56,074 --> 02:11:58,075
I am Jerusalem.

985
02:12:02,497 --> 02:12:07,501
Assemble the army! Yeah!

986
02:12:28,774 --> 02:12:33,527
Now this assembly of barons
and all Jerusalem is complete.

987
02:12:34,363 --> 02:12:37,406
There are those among you
who may disagree

988
02:12:37,783 --> 02:12:40,826
with our succession,
but it is war.

989
02:12:40,869 --> 02:12:42,244
Aye!

990
02:12:42,704 --> 02:12:44,956
And I am...

991
02:12:47,709 --> 02:12:48,834
the King.

992
02:12:50,379 --> 02:12:53,631
We march at once.
What say this council?

993
02:12:53,715 --> 02:12:55,132
Aye!

994
02:12:56,176 --> 02:12:57,343
No.

995
02:12:57,719 --> 02:12:59,136
If you must have war,

996
02:13:00,097 --> 02:13:02,431
this army cannot move away
from water.

997
02:13:03,684 --> 02:13:05,977
You have a chance
to hold the city.

998
02:13:06,603 --> 02:13:08,980
But if you move out
against Salah-al Din,

999
02:13:10,232 --> 02:13:13,693
this army will be destroyed,
and the city left defenseless.

1000
02:13:13,735 --> 02:13:18,739
When I wish a blacksmith
to advise me in war, I will tell him.

1001
02:13:19,074 --> 02:13:21,325
Salah-al Din wants you to come out.

1002
02:13:24,454 --> 02:13:26,831
He is waiting for you
to make that mistake.

1003
02:13:27,916 --> 02:13:29,250
He knows his man.

1004
02:13:30,127 --> 02:13:32,712
- We should meet the enemies of God!
- Aye!

1005
02:13:32,838 --> 02:13:34,171
And so we shall!

1006
02:13:35,215 --> 02:13:36,424
Then you do so

1007
02:13:37,009 --> 02:13:41,012
without my knights.
- Then I will have the glory, Tiberias.

1008
02:13:41,221 --> 02:13:43,723
You had yours
years and years ago.

1009
02:13:45,225 --> 02:13:47,101
It's time for mine.

1010
02:13:52,691 --> 02:13:54,400
Forward!

1011
02:13:55,360 --> 02:13:56,777
Forward!

1012
02:13:57,904 --> 02:13:59,113
Forward!

1013
02:13:59,656 --> 02:14:00,698
Forward!

1014
02:14:15,756 --> 02:14:16,797
Tiberias.

1015
02:14:19,843 --> 02:14:22,470
When Salah-al Din has finished
with Guy, he will come.

1016
02:14:23,430 --> 02:14:25,139
We must look to the defenses.

1017
02:14:26,183 --> 02:14:27,349
The boy is dead.

1018
02:14:33,106 --> 02:14:34,482
- Guy?
- No.

1019
02:14:34,941 --> 02:14:37,026
The boy was leperous like his uncle.

1020
02:14:38,111 --> 02:14:39,570
She gave him peace.

1021
02:14:40,489 --> 02:14:41,739
She let him go.

1022
02:14:44,826 --> 02:14:47,787
And Jerusalem along with him.

1023
02:14:55,212 --> 02:14:56,587
You go with the army?

1024
02:14:57,464 --> 02:14:59,090
My order is with the army.

1025
02:15:00,467 --> 02:15:01,926
You go to certain death.

1026
02:15:02,677 --> 02:15:04,178
All death is certain.

1027
02:15:04,679 --> 02:15:07,348
I shall tell your father
what I've seen you become.

1028
02:15:33,875 --> 02:15:35,417
♪ ...cogner ici. ♪

1029
02:15:35,460 --> 02:15:41,757
♪ Ma fille, c'est le charpentier
qui raccomode. ♪

1030
02:15:50,267 --> 02:15:51,934
When Salah-al Din comes,

1031
02:15:53,854 --> 02:15:55,479
we're not defensible.

1032
02:15:58,400 --> 02:16:00,860
Save the people
from what I have done.

1033
02:16:02,362 --> 02:16:03,445
I will.

1034
02:17:06,718 --> 02:17:07,843
God wills it.

1035
02:17:38,166 --> 02:17:39,416
Can you sense it?

1036
02:17:40,377 --> 02:17:42,086
There has been no messenger.

1037
02:19:04,210 --> 02:19:05,878
I drink water for what it is.

1038
02:19:10,884 --> 02:19:12,843
I did not give the cup to you.

1039
02:19:13,553 --> 02:19:15,429
No, my lord.

1040
02:20:25,875 --> 02:20:27,668
A king does not kill a king.

1041
02:20:28,962 --> 02:20:31,338
Were you not close enough
to a great king

1042
02:20:31,464 --> 02:20:33,549
to learn by his example?

1043
02:21:11,671 --> 02:21:13,755
I've given Jerusalem my whole life,

1044
02:21:14,757 --> 02:21:15,841
everything.

1045
02:21:19,012 --> 02:21:20,429
First I thought we...

1046
02:21:22,098 --> 02:21:23,640
were fighting for God.

1047
02:21:24,601 --> 02:21:28,437
Then I realized we were fighting
for wealth and... land.

1048
02:21:29,397 --> 02:21:30,522
I was ashamed.

1049
02:21:39,365 --> 02:21:40,449
Tiberias.

1050
02:21:41,743 --> 02:21:43,869
There is no more Jerusalem.

1051
02:21:46,080 --> 02:21:49,208
I shall go to Cyprus.
Will you come with me?

1052
02:21:50,126 --> 02:21:51,418
No.

1053
02:21:52,795 --> 02:21:54,421
You are your father's son.

1054
02:21:57,759 --> 02:22:00,969
Salah-al Din must move his army
from water to water.

1055
02:22:01,513 --> 02:22:05,390
That gives you four days!
Maybe five!

1056
02:22:07,101 --> 02:22:08,268
God be with you.

1057
02:22:09,854 --> 02:22:11,355
He's no longer with me.

1058
02:23:06,327 --> 02:23:07,452
Mark four hundred.

1059
02:23:07,954 --> 02:23:09,121
Four hundred!

1060
02:23:09,872 --> 02:23:11,039
Four hundred!

1061
02:23:26,639 --> 02:23:27,764
They're here.

1062
02:23:28,516 --> 02:23:29,850
It is only one man.

1063
02:23:33,646 --> 02:23:35,814
No. They're here.

1064
02:23:57,503 --> 02:24:00,297
This is the only section of the wall
that they can attack

1065
02:24:00,340 --> 02:24:02,174
once they begin
to bombard the walls.

1066
02:24:02,759 --> 02:24:05,552
They will stop only to avoid
hitting their own siege towers

1067
02:24:05,595 --> 02:24:06,637
as they come in.

1068
02:24:07,055 --> 02:24:08,430
We take the bombardment.

1069
02:24:08,806 --> 02:24:10,849
When they cease firing, we fire.

1070
02:24:15,104 --> 02:24:16,730
We must leave the city!

1071
02:24:18,066 --> 02:24:19,816
How exactly, my lord Bishop?

1072
02:24:19,901 --> 02:24:22,277
The fastest horses
from a lesser gate.

1073
02:24:24,113 --> 02:24:25,238
And the people?

1074
02:24:25,281 --> 02:24:28,450
It is unfortunate about the people,
but it is God's will!

1075
02:24:38,086 --> 02:24:39,378
Silence!

1076
02:24:40,713 --> 02:24:41,963
Silence!

1077
02:24:42,382 --> 02:24:43,507
Silence!

1078
02:24:48,513 --> 02:24:52,182
It has fallen to us
to defend Jerusalem.

1079
02:24:52,767 --> 02:24:57,062
And we have made our preparations
as well as they can be made.

1080
02:24:58,606 --> 02:25:02,192
None of us
took this city from Muslims.

1081
02:25:03,486 --> 02:25:07,197
No Muslim of the great army
now coming against us

1082
02:25:07,365 --> 02:25:10,659
was born
when this city was lost.

1083
02:25:12,370 --> 02:25:16,456
We fight
over an offense we did not give,

1084
02:25:17,500 --> 02:25:20,335
against those who were not alive
to be offended.

1085
02:25:22,672 --> 02:25:24,005
What is Jerusalem?

1086
02:25:25,091 --> 02:25:29,845
Your holy places lie over the Jewish
temple that the Romans pulled down.

1087
02:25:30,930 --> 02:25:33,640
The Muslim places of worship
lie over yours.

1088
02:25:36,644 --> 02:25:38,145
Which is more holy?

1089
02:25:41,065 --> 02:25:42,232
The wall?

1090
02:25:43,109 --> 02:25:44,234
The mosque?

1091
02:25:44,902 --> 02:25:46,153
The sepulcher?

1092
02:25:47,321 --> 02:25:48,655
Who has claim?

1093
02:25:49,824 --> 02:25:51,575
No one has claim.

1094
02:25:52,577 --> 02:25:54,828
All have claim!

1095
02:25:55,037 --> 02:25:57,080
- That is blasphemy!
- Be quiet!

1096
02:25:57,331 --> 02:25:58,832
We defend this city

1097
02:25:59,751 --> 02:26:04,921
not to protect these stones, but
the people living within these walls.

1098
02:26:27,361 --> 02:26:28,403
My lord!

1099
02:26:29,363 --> 02:26:30,697
My lord! My lord!

1100
02:26:31,449 --> 02:26:35,577
How are we to defend Jerusalem
without knights?

1101
02:26:35,953 --> 02:26:37,287
We have no knights!

1102
02:26:37,622 --> 02:26:38,747
Truly?

1103
02:26:48,883 --> 02:26:52,052
- What is your condition?
- I am servant to the Patriarch.

1104
02:26:52,386 --> 02:26:55,680
- That is... one of my servants.
- Is he?

1105
02:26:56,432 --> 02:26:57,891
You were born a servant?

1106
02:26:59,393 --> 02:27:00,560
Kneel.

1107
02:27:05,691 --> 02:27:07,234
Every man at arms

1108
02:27:08,110 --> 02:27:09,986
or capable of bearing them,

1109
02:27:10,863 --> 02:27:11,947
kneel!

1110
02:27:16,577 --> 02:27:17,953
On your knees!

1111
02:27:24,710 --> 02:27:27,420
Be without fear
in the face of your enemies.

1112
02:27:28,840 --> 02:27:32,384
Be brave and upright,
that God may love thee.

1113
02:27:34,428 --> 02:27:37,722
Speak the truth,
even if it leads to your death.

1114
02:27:40,476 --> 02:27:41,977
Safeguard the helpless.

1115
02:27:43,145 --> 02:27:44,479
That is your oath.

1116
02:27:49,861 --> 02:27:51,653
And that is so you remember it.

1117
02:27:52,530 --> 02:27:53,780
Rise a knight!

1118
02:27:55,408 --> 02:27:56,992
Rise a knight!

1119
02:28:05,167 --> 02:28:06,585
Master Gravedigger.

1120
02:28:07,461 --> 02:28:09,337
- It is you?
- Not what I was.

1121
02:28:09,881 --> 02:28:11,047
Nor are you.

1122
02:28:11,215 --> 02:28:12,424
Rise a knight.

1123
02:28:15,887 --> 02:28:17,304
Who do you think you are?

1124
02:28:17,847 --> 02:28:19,431
Will you alter the world?

1125
02:28:20,224 --> 02:28:23,977
Does making a man a knight
make him a better fighter?

1126
02:28:30,860 --> 02:28:31,985
Yes.

1127
02:29:08,189 --> 02:29:09,230
Almaric,

1128
02:29:12,777 --> 02:29:13,985
if you survive,

1129
02:29:15,655 --> 02:29:16,988
Ibelin is yours.

1130
02:29:19,575 --> 02:29:21,242
You are master of Ibelin.

1131
02:29:27,792 --> 02:29:28,833
I confirm it.

1132
02:29:31,003 --> 02:29:34,798
Rise a knight... and baron of Ibelin.

1133
02:29:36,801 --> 02:29:39,886
But... it is a poor and dusty place.

1134
02:29:50,356 --> 02:29:51,815
There can be no victory

1135
02:29:51,941 --> 02:29:53,233
except through God!

1136
02:29:53,359 --> 02:29:54,401
My lord?

1137
02:29:55,111 --> 02:29:56,277
No.

1138
02:29:57,405 --> 02:29:59,823
May God be with us!

1139
02:30:05,746 --> 02:30:08,456
When... will it begin?

1140
02:30:12,211 --> 02:30:13,336
Soon.

1141
02:30:30,312 --> 02:30:31,604
Balista!

1142
02:30:44,910 --> 02:30:46,536
Get them to the walls!

1143
02:30:48,497 --> 02:30:51,207
Water! Bring water!

1144
02:30:53,544 --> 02:30:55,211
Get the machines to the walls!

1145
02:30:57,757 --> 02:30:59,299
Push!

1146
02:31:02,219 --> 02:31:03,261
Run!

1147
02:31:04,180 --> 02:31:05,221
Push!

1148
02:31:22,698 --> 02:31:24,365
Why do they not fire back?

1149
02:31:25,201 --> 02:31:26,409
They wait.

1150
02:32:54,039 --> 02:32:55,582
That was only the first day.

1151
02:32:56,333 --> 02:32:57,917
There may be a hundred more.

1152
02:32:58,419 --> 02:33:01,546
Salah-al Din will show no mercy.

1153
02:33:05,509 --> 02:33:06,676
We must hold out.

1154
02:33:07,511 --> 02:33:09,095
Force him to offer terms.

1155
02:33:09,555 --> 02:33:11,973
- What terms?
- We fight for the people,

1156
02:33:12,975 --> 02:33:14,726
their safety and freedom.

1157
02:34:09,990 --> 02:34:12,951
- Mercy.
- No. I cannot.

1158
02:35:03,335 --> 02:35:05,753
- Four hundred!
- Four hundred!

1159
02:35:06,046 --> 02:35:07,880
- Four hundred!
- Fire!

1160
02:35:07,923 --> 02:35:09,132
Fire!

1161
02:35:38,329 --> 02:35:39,370
Three hundred!

1162
02:35:39,538 --> 02:35:41,247
- Three hundred!
- Fire!

1163
02:35:41,498 --> 02:35:42,790
Fire!

1164
02:35:43,334 --> 02:35:44,375
Fire!

1165
02:35:53,385 --> 02:35:55,511
- One fifty!
- One fifty!

1166
02:36:30,798 --> 02:36:32,256
Hold your fire!

1167
02:36:33,801 --> 02:36:35,009
Hold!

1168
02:36:42,226 --> 02:36:43,267
Fire!

1169
02:36:44,311 --> 02:36:45,645
Fire!

1170
02:37:23,225 --> 02:37:25,643
Oil! Now!

1171
02:37:29,356 --> 02:37:30,773
Fire!

1172
02:37:50,669 --> 02:37:51,794
Who defends?

1173
02:37:52,588 --> 02:37:55,006
Balian of Ibelin,
the son of Godfrey.

1174
02:37:55,382 --> 02:37:56,424
Godfrey.

1175
02:37:57,259 --> 02:38:01,471
Godfrey nearly killed me
in the Lebanon. Truly.

1176
02:38:01,680 --> 02:38:05,600
- I did not know he had a son.
- It was his son at Kerak.

1177
02:38:10,397 --> 02:38:12,857
- The one you let live.
- Yes.

1178
02:38:13,317 --> 02:38:15,151
Perhaps you should not have.

1179
02:38:15,694 --> 02:38:19,071
Perhaps... I should have had
a different teacher.

1180
02:40:38,754 --> 02:40:41,297
- Fire!
- Fire!

1181
02:40:44,426 --> 02:40:45,468
Fire!

1182
02:40:47,137 --> 02:40:48,179
Fire!

1183
02:40:50,265 --> 02:40:51,307
Fire!

1184
02:40:52,476 --> 02:40:53,517
Now!

1185
02:41:54,079 --> 02:41:55,621
You are not a sister.

1186
02:41:57,207 --> 02:41:58,541
We are what we do.

1187
02:42:00,168 --> 02:42:03,546
Then I am a man who's traveled
a long way to die for nothing.

1188
02:42:04,840 --> 02:42:06,549
What would you say to that?

1189
02:42:11,972 --> 02:42:13,681
I would say that I'm sorry.

1190
02:42:14,474 --> 02:42:15,975
And I'm sorry for you,

1191
02:42:18,353 --> 02:42:19,895
Queen of Jerusalem.

1192
02:43:10,822 --> 02:43:12,198
When a body is burnt,

1193
02:43:13,116 --> 02:43:15,868
it cannot be resurrected
until Judgment Day.

1194
02:43:17,078 --> 02:43:18,954
If we do not burn these bodies,

1195
02:43:19,080 --> 02:43:21,665
we will all be dead of disease
in three days.

1196
02:43:22,667 --> 02:43:24,502
God will understand, my lord.

1197
02:43:26,004 --> 02:43:27,213
And if He doesn't,

1198
02:43:28,799 --> 02:43:30,174
then He is not God,

1199
02:43:31,301 --> 02:43:33,010
and we need not worry.

1200
02:43:49,236 --> 02:43:52,530
The wall where the Christopher gate
used to be has been weakened.

1201
02:43:52,572 --> 02:43:56,325
Yes. Usually when a gate is blocked in,
it is weaker than the wall around it.

1202
02:43:56,368 --> 02:43:59,036
- Or stronger.
- It is weaker! Rashid has seen it!

1203
02:43:59,830 --> 02:44:02,873
This will be our door into Jerusalem.

1204
02:44:14,511 --> 02:44:16,595
This is where we will make our stand.

1205
02:44:17,305 --> 02:44:18,430
We must prepare.

1206
02:44:22,310 --> 02:44:23,352
Brothers!

1207
02:44:23,770 --> 02:44:24,812
Brothers!

1208
02:44:25,230 --> 02:44:27,314
God has sent you this day!

1209
02:44:28,024 --> 02:44:33,237
You will take no prisoners!
As they did so shall it be done!

1210
02:44:33,947 --> 02:44:36,866
- Allahu akbar!
- Allahu akbar!

1211
02:45:14,279 --> 02:45:15,905
When this wall comes down,

1212
02:45:19,117 --> 02:45:20,826
there will be no quarter.

1213
02:45:22,454 --> 02:45:24,330
If you throw down your arms,

1214
02:45:25,415 --> 02:45:27,124
your families will die.

1215
02:45:31,671 --> 02:45:34,006
We can break this army here.

1216
02:45:38,386 --> 02:45:40,137
So I say, let them come.

1217
02:45:41,765 --> 02:45:43,057
Let them come!

1218
02:45:44,476 --> 02:45:45,643
Come on!

1219
02:45:46,353 --> 02:45:49,271
Come on! Come on!

1220
02:49:26,614 --> 02:49:28,073
Remember me in France,

1221
02:49:29,617 --> 02:49:31,076
Master Gravedigger.

1222
02:49:31,494 --> 02:49:32,536
My lord!

1223
02:50:06,321 --> 02:50:07,821
They will ask for terms.

1224
02:50:08,823 --> 02:50:10,908
They must... ask for terms.

1225
02:50:11,743 --> 02:50:14,661
Convert to Islam. Repent later.

1226
02:50:17,457 --> 02:50:19,666
You've taught me
a lot about religion,

1227
02:50:19,709 --> 02:50:20,918
Your Eminence.

1228
02:50:43,191 --> 02:50:44,775
Will you yield the city?

1229
02:50:49,989 --> 02:50:52,908
Before I lose it,
I will burn it to the ground.

1230
02:50:53,785 --> 02:50:55,953
Your holy places, ours,

1231
02:50:56,204 --> 02:50:59,164
every last thing in Jerusalem
that drives men mad.

1232
02:51:01,084 --> 02:51:03,710
I wonder if it would not be better
if you did.

1233
02:51:04,629 --> 02:51:07,256
- You will destroy it?
- Every stone.

1234
02:51:07,715 --> 02:51:11,510
And every Christian knight you kill
will take ten Saracens with him.

1235
02:51:11,678 --> 02:51:14,513
You will destroy your army here
and never raise another.

1236
02:51:14,555 --> 02:51:17,933
I swear to God that to take this city
will be the end of you.

1237
02:51:23,648 --> 02:51:26,858
Your city
is full of women and children.

1238
02:51:27,151 --> 02:51:31,071
If my army will die,
so will your city.

1239
02:51:35,660 --> 02:51:37,619
Do you offer terms?
I ask none.

1240
02:51:43,042 --> 02:51:47,170
I will give every soul
safe conduct to Christian lands.

1241
02:51:47,588 --> 02:51:48,755
Every soul.

1242
02:51:49,590 --> 02:51:55,262
The women, the children, the old
and all your knights and soldiers

1243
02:51:55,388 --> 02:51:56,805
and your Queen.

1244
02:51:57,849 --> 02:52:00,892
Your King, such as he is,

1245
02:52:01,227 --> 02:52:05,272
I leave to you
and what God will make of him.

1246
02:52:06,107 --> 02:52:09,234
No one will be harmed.
I swear to God.

1247
02:52:09,944 --> 02:52:12,612
The Christians butchered
every Muslim within the walls

1248
02:52:12,655 --> 02:52:13,697
when they took this city.

1249
02:52:14,657 --> 02:52:19,745
I am not those men.
I am Salah-al Din.

1250
02:52:20,121 --> 02:52:21,496
Salah-al Din.

1251
02:52:33,593 --> 02:52:36,219
Then, under these terms,
I surrender Jerusalem.

1252
02:52:41,434 --> 02:52:42,934
And peace be with you.

1253
02:52:48,107 --> 02:52:49,566
What is Jerusalem worth?

1254
02:52:51,819 --> 02:52:53,028
Nothing.

1255
02:52:59,786 --> 02:53:00,869
Everything.

1256
02:53:42,537 --> 02:53:44,246
I have surrendered Jerusalem.

1257
02:53:46,707 --> 02:53:49,042
All will be safely escorted
to the sea.

1258
02:53:52,004 --> 02:53:54,005
If this is the Kingdom of Heaven,

1259
02:53:57,760 --> 02:53:59,928
let God do with it as He wills.

1260
02:54:12,650 --> 02:54:14,317
Balian! Balian!

1261
02:54:15,445 --> 02:54:16,653
Balian!

1262
02:54:35,381 --> 02:54:37,257
Your brother's kingdom was here

1263
02:54:38,092 --> 02:54:39,259
and here.

1264
02:54:40,845 --> 02:54:43,054
That kingdom
can never be surrendered.

1265
02:54:50,521 --> 02:54:51,688
What should I do?

1266
02:54:55,401 --> 02:54:58,904
I'm still the Queen of Acre,
Ascalon, Tripoli.

1267
02:55:00,490 --> 02:55:02,157
Decide not to be a queen

1268
02:55:03,201 --> 02:55:04,784
and I will come to you.

1269
02:55:35,274 --> 02:55:37,400
The perfect knight.

1270
02:55:37,860 --> 02:55:39,945
Is that what you think you are?
Is it?

1271
02:55:54,794 --> 02:55:56,753
We are all of us what we do.

1272
02:57:07,700 --> 02:57:08,783
Do it.

1273
02:57:13,998 --> 02:57:15,457
When you rise again,

1274
02:57:16,250 --> 02:57:17,417
if you rise,

1275
02:57:20,379 --> 02:57:21,838
rise a knight.

1276
02:58:35,746 --> 02:58:36,871
This horse

1277
02:58:40,793 --> 02:58:42,794
is not a very good horse.

1278
02:58:43,546 --> 02:58:44,838
I will not keep it.

1279
02:58:46,966 --> 02:58:48,133
Thank you.

1280
02:58:52,263 --> 02:58:54,013
And if God does not love you,

1281
02:58:54,765 --> 02:58:57,684
how could you have done
all the things that you have done?

1282
02:58:59,311 --> 02:59:00,729
Peace be upon you.

1283
03:01:16,407 --> 03:01:17,949
A queen never walks.

1284
03:01:25,457 --> 03:01:26,916
And yet you are walking.

1285
03:02:47,039 --> 03:02:48,331
Forward!

1286
03:02:50,793 --> 03:02:51,876
Forward!

1287
03:02:56,173 --> 03:02:57,215
Halt!

1288
03:03:02,096 --> 03:03:04,681
We crusade to recover
the Kingdom of Jerusalem.

1289
03:03:09,603 --> 03:03:11,729
You go
to where the men speak Italian

1290
03:03:12,773 --> 03:03:15,650
and then continue
until they speak something else.

1291
03:03:24,576 --> 03:03:26,619
We come by this road
to find Balian

1292
03:03:27,371 --> 03:03:29,247
who was defender of Jerusalem.

1293
03:03:30,582 --> 03:03:31,833
I am the blacksmith.

1294
03:03:35,254 --> 03:03:37,046
And I am the King of England.

1295
03:03:38,424 --> 03:03:39,882
I am the blacksmith.

1296
03:03:44,263 --> 03:03:45,430
Formation!

1297
03:03:46,974 --> 03:03:48,099
Forward!
