1
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,810
In 1942, most of Western Europe ...

2
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,870
had fallen under the onslaught of the German army.

3
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:09,230
But in the east, the Soviet Union
resists the invasion of Nazi forces.

4
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:15,830
Throughout the Eastern Front is a desperate
struggle for every inch of land.

5
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:21,570
Both sides suffer heavy losses.

6
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:26,739
And neither party will be satisfied
for anything less than victory.

7
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,469
Victory at any cost!

8
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:35,649
FIRST SQUADRON:
MOMENT OF TRUTH

9
00:03:11,338 --> 00:03:13,298
Attack!

10
00:03:45,537 --> 00:03:48,297
That girl is obviously mentally ill.

11
00:03:48,907 --> 00:03:50,997
Don't exaggerate.

12
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:54,317
She is an orphan, a victim of war.

13
00:04:19,566 --> 00:04:21,566
Smile!

14
00:04:21,846 --> 00:04:24,156
It is for the party newspaper.

15
00:04:26,596 --> 00:04:29,536
And now, our next attraction ...

16
00:04:29,616 --> 00:04:31,496
I'm not afraid to say ...

17
00:04:31,556 --> 00:04:34,656
an amazing girl wonder.  Let's
give her a round of applause!

18
00:04:34,906 --> 00:04:36,976
She can answer any question. 

19
00:04:37,006 --> 00:04:39,996
Ask her anything, even your
innermost secrets.

20
00:04:40,696 --> 00:04:44,486
Come on, just ask.  Don't be shy.

21
00:04:47,825 --> 00:04:48,955
What's my name?

22
00:04:53,925 --> 00:04:55,355
Dimitry Sonin.

23
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:59,145
It's true, folks!  Well done.

24
00:05:02,615 --> 00:05:06,915
And you are private Panteleyev, from Tula.

25
00:05:07,495 --> 00:05:10,745
Your nickname in school was "Mozart".

26
00:05:11,315 --> 00:05:12,315
That's true, he told me so.

27
00:05:12,605 --> 00:05:15,595
Okay, everyone, let's find out when
the offensive is starting.

28
00:05:17,685 --> 00:05:19,865
What's my name?
When will I receive a letter from home?

29
00:05:19,935 --> 00:05:21,815
Who stole my knife?

30
00:05:22,535 --> 00:05:24,445
Will Lyuba marry me?

31
00:05:37,524 --> 00:05:39,324
I just wanted to ask ...

32
00:05:39,374 --> 00:05:41,844
How long do I have to live?

33
00:05:52,764 --> 00:05:57,014
Nadya, time to wrap up ...

34
00:05:57,104 --> 00:05:59,284
We're ...

35
00:06:00,284 --> 00:06:01,744
Airstrike!

36
00:07:01,382 --> 00:07:03,362
Happy birthday, little Nadya.

37
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:34,961
Stealing apples is not okay.

38
00:07:35,111 --> 00:07:36,321
Yes, sorry ...

39
00:07:36,401 --> 00:07:38,561
I'm Leo, what's your name?

40
00:07:40,261 --> 00:07:40,831
Nadya.

41
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,480
This is the Friendship of Nations
fountain.

42
00:08:47,139 --> 00:08:48,359
Nadya, this ...

43
00:08:48,589 --> 00:08:50,119
is for you.

44
00:08:50,149 --> 00:08:51,879
How cute!

45
00:08:51,969 --> 00:08:52,969
Thanks!

46
00:09:25,138 --> 00:09:27,038
Marat, let's race!

47
00:09:27,538 --> 00:09:29,988
I cannot go any faster with this thing.

48
00:09:31,318 --> 00:09:34,638
Lieutenant Valya destroyed
another enemy bomber!

49
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:57,617
Don't worry, you'll learn it too.

50
00:09:57,717 --> 00:10:00,607
Everyone at the boarding
school can do this.

51
00:10:09,647 --> 00:10:12,387
Explosive substances can
also be mixed using ...

52
00:10:13,787 --> 00:10:17,177
It is your duty to be fearless ...

53
00:10:17,537 --> 00:10:20,807
determined, calm
in any situation ...

54
00:10:21,437 --> 00:10:25,407
maintain a common bond,
and, most importantly ...

55
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:29,856
abide by the principles
of the 6th Division.

56
00:11:04,465 --> 00:11:08,335
Quick, hide there and don't come
out until I return!

57
00:11:09,785 --> 00:11:12,045
I'll get the guys and come back.

58
00:11:12,285 --> 00:11:16,065
Don't worry, and do not move from here.
No matter what happens.

59
00:11:37,005 --> 00:11:39,325
We have them, let's go.

60
00:12:04,674 --> 00:12:08,024
Run for the exit!  It's 
too soon for you to die!

61
00:12:08,604 --> 00:12:09,954
Leo, I don't understand ...

62
00:12:09,984 --> 00:12:13,544
You are trapped between life
and death, but you must survive.

63
00:12:13,764 --> 00:12:15,254
Run!

64
00:12:22,453 --> 00:12:25,153
At last, we meet again ...

65
00:12:27,753 --> 00:12:28,973
Gentlemen ...

66
00:12:29,113 --> 00:12:33,583
leaders of the Reich are concerned about
the state of affairs on the Eastern Front.

67
00:12:33,693 --> 00:12:36,813
All offensives on the Eastern Front
during the winter campaign have failed.

68
00:12:36,843 --> 00:12:40,933
The army proved unable to
break the Russian lines.

69
00:12:41,123 --> 00:12:45,143
To win this war, we must
take drastic measures!

70
00:12:45,303 --> 00:12:46,953
What do you suggest?

71
00:12:47,003 --> 00:12:50,713
It is time to start
Operation Sword of Vengeance.

72
00:12:50,743 --> 00:12:55,303
Astrologers have confirmed that
the Moment of Truth is approaching.

73
00:12:56,372 --> 00:13:00,672
But Director, for such a ritual we
would would need an artifact ...

74
00:13:00,942 --> 00:13:03,562
with a great energy potential.

75
00:13:05,532 --> 00:13:09,492
And finally, we have one!

76
00:13:09,762 --> 00:13:15,022
Gentlemen, behold the legendary sword
of Grandmaster Baron von Wolff.

77
00:13:15,332 --> 00:13:18,812
With it, we shall summon the
baron's ghost to join our cause!

78
00:13:35,891 --> 00:13:38,851
That is my sword!
Give it back to me!

79
00:13:41,241 --> 00:13:44,801
Grand Master, we Elders
of the Ahnenerbe ...

80
00:13:44,801 --> 00:13:50,331
call upon you and your fallen brothers.

81
00:13:50,781 --> 00:13:53,691
Rise from the dead,
and with this sword ...

82
00:13:53,721 --> 00:13:56,531
take revenge on your sworn
enemies -- the Russians.

83
00:13:57,731 --> 00:14:01,481
I've waited 700 years,
dreaming of revenge!

84
00:14:01,621 --> 00:14:04,421
At last, my sword returns to my hands.

85
00:14:05,871 --> 00:14:09,161
I accept your offer!

86
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,850
Come, Nadya.

87
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:4 4,950
That knight ... I have dreamt about him.

88
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:48,150
I had this nightmare, over and over.

89
00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:50,539
This dream is the last thing I remember.

90
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:55,349
He was a legendary warrior and sorcerer,
known as Baron von Wolff.

91
00:14:56,409 --> 00:15:01,539
Baron and the knights of his Order were
excommunicated for practicing black magic.

92
00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:07,499
In 1242, he set out to conquer Russia.

93
00:15:11,949 --> 00:15:16,109
Von Wolff's crusaders burned villages ...

94
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:19,339
and slaughtered their inhabitants.

95
00:15:20,239 --> 00:15:24,499
Many believed he was served
by demons of the underworld.

96
00:15:26,588 --> 00:15:30,818
But finally, people of many villages
united to resist the Order ...

97
00:15:30,818 --> 00:15:35,778
and managed to defeat Von Wolff in a conflict
referred to as the "Battle on the Ice".


98
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:42,388
The knights of the Order perished
at the bottom of the lake.

99
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:51,108
A prophecy says that 700 years
after his death ...

100
00:15:51,328 --> 00:15:53,888
the Baron's ghost will return to life.

101
00:15:54,278 --> 00:15:57,348
And this is the year, 1942, which will mark ...

102
00:15:57,638 --> 00:16:00,068
when those 700 years will have elapsed.

103
00:16:01,218 --> 00:16:04,288
But why have I been dreaming about this?

104
00:16:04,577 --> 00:16:07,087
Nadya, those aren't just dreams.
They are visions.

105
00:16:07,217 --> 00:16:09,517
You must use your gift to avert disaster.

106
00:16:10,277 --> 00:16:14,957
You have the gift of premonition.

107
00:16:15,347 --> 00:16:18,987
But I don't even know who I am,
or where I am ...

108
00:16:20,147 --> 00:16:22,787
Now eat.

109
00:16:23,137 --> 00:16:25,957
You have a long journey ahead of you.

110
00:16:26,227 --> 00:16:27,877
I have nowhere to go.

111
00:16:28,147 --> 00:16:30,997
I don't remember where I live.

112
00:16:31,577 --> 00:16:35,887
We will go to Moscow together, 
to the Kremlin ...

113
00:16:36,637 --> 00:16:40,297
I'll take you where ...

114
00:16:40,397 --> 00:16:44,257
your help is needed most.

115
00:16:54,846 --> 00:16:59,146
Nadya, go to Moscow ...

116
00:16:59,926 --> 00:17:03,966
find General Belov in the Kremlin,
he will explain everything.

117
00:17:04,026 --> 00:17:04,676
And you?

118
00:17:04,746 --> 00:17:06,616
Don't worry about me, just go!

119
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:02,423
Go away!

120
00:19:07,413 --> 00:19:09,143
Please, allow me to enter.

121
00:19:09,313 --> 00:19:11,663
I really need to get in.

122
00:19:25,562 --> 00:19:27,292
Where is the General Belov?

123
00:19:27,952 --> 00:19:32,942
Please, I must see 
General Belov immediately.

124
00:19:35,092 --> 00:19:38,212
You know, little girl, if you
behave violently again ...

125
00:19:38,332 --> 00:19:40,942
we'll be forced to sedate you.

126
00:19:42,482 --> 00:19:45,352
I cannot let you see General Belov ...

127
00:19:45,702 --> 00:19:47,012
because no such person exists.

128
00:19:47,362 --> 00:19:50,912
He is a figment of your imagination,
a side effect of the contusion.

129
00:19:51,651 --> 00:19:54,621
Oh, contusion?  I see, but ...

130
00:19:55,671 --> 00:19:57,151
Lies!  You don't know anything!

131
00:19:57,251 --> 00:19:58,851
Let me out, now!

132
00:20:02,111 --> 00:20:06,221
We do they accept these lunatics?  We
are full with the wounded as we are.

133
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:35,650
Who are you?

134
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:40,240
You don't know who I am?

135
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,630
I am your commander, General Belov.

136
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:49,250
We have been searching all over for you.

137
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:52,060
What happened?

138
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,680
Sorry, but I do not remember anything.

139
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:58,660
I spoke with the doctors.

140
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:01,030
A blow to your head has
damaged your memory.

141
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:03,470
Do you remember anything at all?

142
00:21:04,089 --> 00:21:05,469
A circus ...

143
00:21:05,539 --> 00:21:07,809
friends, summer ...

144
00:21:08,049 --> 00:21:12,279
boarding school ... then the war began ...
my friends were killed ...

145
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:16,829
That was over six months ago, many
things have happened since.

146
00:21:17,259 --> 00:21:19,559
We don't have much time.

147
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:22,579
I'll tell you everything you need to know.

148
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:30,309
World War II is under way.
	
149
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:34,719
Nazi Germany attacked our country.

150
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:38,349
Parallel to regular military operations ...

151
00:21:38,509 --> 00:21:43,259
two occult secret service agencies are
engaged in a covert struggle.

152
00:21:43,298 --> 00:21:46,638
The German "Ahnenerbe" within the SS ...

153
00:21:46,748 --> 00:21:50,478
against the 6th Division of the Soviet
Military Intelligence -- that's us.

154
00:21:51,988 --> 00:21:54,578
We are not a regular intelligence
division though.

155
00:21:54,658 --> 00:21:57,258
We use the tools of occult and magic:

156
00:21:57,258 --> 00:22:00,728
astrology, clairvoyance, and hypnosis.

157
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:03,878
I am the director of the 6th Division.

158
00:22:03,918 --> 00:22:05,808
And you, you are my best agent.

159
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:10,108
Since the beginning of the war, you have
completed numerous important missions.

160
00:22:10,528 --> 00:22:15,298
A week ago, we sent you to the frontline on
an assignment, as a member of a propaganda team.

161
00:22:15,498 --> 00:22:18,358
That's where you vanished.

162
00:22:24,477 --> 00:22:28,357
Your parents both had extrasensory abilities.

163
00:22:29,767 --> 00:22:31,227
Ever since they died ...

164
00:22:31,367 --> 00:22:34,457
the 6th Division has been your family.

165
00:22:35,107 --> 00:22:37,077
They died?  How, when?

166
00:22:37,207 --> 00:22:39,447
Before the war, while performing their duty.

167
00:22:42,967 --> 00:22:44,967
We have an tremendous workload now ...

168
00:22:45,007 --> 00:22:46,967
we need you more than ever!

169
00:22:50,127 --> 00:22:54,907
Much depends on the counter-operation
we are currently planning.

170
00:23:02,316 --> 00:23:06,866
The Astro-radar shows enormous
activity in the Beyond.

171
00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:10,346
We have intelligence that the
Ahnenerbe have found a powerful ally.

172
00:23:10,406 --> 00:23:14,506
If it's Baron von Wolff and his knights,
we have a real problem on our hands.

173
00:23:14,866 --> 00:23:16,316
Does that look familiar?

174
00:23:16,496 --> 00:23:19,306
I saw him in my dreams.  He will come soon.

175
00:23:19,426 --> 00:23:20,906
Yes, very soon.

176
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:23,376
The old prophecy is being fulfilled.

177
00:23:24,476 --> 00:23:26,766
And that means that within hours ...

178
00:23:26,766 --> 00:23:29,566
The spirits of Von Wolff and his warriors ...

179
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:32,276
will fall upon our positions.

180
00:23:32,466 --> 00:23:36,566
Obviously, the ghosts and demons
are not afraid of our weapons.

181
00:23:36,725 --> 00:23:39,315
The living cannot even see them.

182
00:23:39,545 --> 00:23:45,465
But how can I help?
You're the only one who can.  I'll explain.

183
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:54,195
For years, the 6th Division has been developing
a special task force of teen agents ...

184
00:23:54,255 --> 00:23:55,405
The First Squadron.

185
00:23:55,495 --> 00:23:58,005
It was terminated at the beginning
of the war by the Ahnenerbe.

186
00:23:59,485 --> 00:24:00,375
Leo

187
00:24:00,685 --> 00:24:01,555
Zena

188
00:24:01,735 --> 00:24:02,465
Marat

189
00:24:02,985 --> 00:24:03,895
Valya

190
00:24:04,005 --> 00:24:05,405
They were all killed ...

191
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:10,455
You're the only survivor
of the First Squadron.

192
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:16,355
Training at our school was designed to create
a spiritual bond between the Squadron members.

193
00:24:16,644 --> 00:24:21,254
That's why you can just call upon the
spirits of your fallen comrades ...

194
00:24:21,414 --> 00:24:24,094
and with them, stop Von Wolff's assault.

195
00:24:25,384 --> 00:24:28,444
The time has come for you
to meet them again!

196
00:24:28,784 --> 00:24:29,724
But how?

197
00:24:29,814 --> 00:24:32,234
You said the Pioneers were killed, weren't they?

198
00:24:32,744 --> 00:24:33,624
Exactly.

199
00:24:33,974 --> 00:24:36,404
I want you to go to the other side.

200
00:24:36,554 --> 00:24:41,794
The 6th Division has created a 
special machine ...

201
00:24:41,864 --> 00:24:45,304
called Sputnik Alpha.
This is our only chance.

202
00:24:45,324 --> 00:24:47,324
Will you do it?

203
00:24:47,744 --> 00:24:49,324
I'll try ...

204
00:24:50,583 --> 00:24:53,273
Your locker is marked with the letter "N".

 205
00:24:53,443 --> 00:24:56,593
There you will find everything 
you need for the assignment.

206
00:25:33,852 --> 00:25:38,272
The machine travels to the Beyond
through the pilot's subconscious ...

207
00:25:38,372 --> 00:25:42,302
so you will land in a familiar place.

208
00:25:42,422 --> 00:25:46,912
Your sword is a rare and powerful
weapon against the supernatural.

209
00:25:47,292 --> 00:25:52,352
Don't hesitate to use it.  You're an expert
with it.  You have very little time, so hurry.

210
00:25:55,652 --> 00:25:56,762
Most importantly ...

211
00:25:56,852 --> 00:26:00,682
do not miss the red return signal.

212
00:26:00,752 --> 00:26:03,232
If you miss it, you'll be stuck there forever.

213
00:26:04,201 --> 00:26:05,961
Come back alive.

214
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:07,961
Let's go!

215
00:26:40,661 --> 00:26:43,021
Hello?  Is there anybody there?

216
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:50,259
Seventy-seventh, Seventy-seventh,
cease fire, over.

217
00:28:08,918 --> 00:28:10,048
Brothers!

218
00:28:10,078 --> 00:28:13,888
When the enemy stole our
victory by deceit ...

219
00:28:13,948 --> 00:28:16,608
and lake ice broke under our feet ...

220
00:28:16,668 --> 00:28:20,308
they thought we had been vanquished forever.

221
00:28:20,658 --> 00:28:22,408
They were wrong!

222
00:28:22,548 --> 00:28:25,618
We haven't spent 700 years
in limbo in vain!

223
00:28:25,818 --> 00:28:30,428
A new Moment of Truth is coming ...

224
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:34,428
and this time, we will be victorious!

225
00:28:34,767 --> 00:28:39,727
We will destroy the destinies of the living!

226
00:28:43,567 --> 00:28:44,917
What?

227
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:47,177
She's alive!

228
00:28:49,757 --> 00:28:51,657
There's no place for the living here.

229
00:28:51,827 --> 00:28:54,747
Okay, take her to the butcher!

230
00:28:55,237 --> 00:28:57,307
Time waits for no man.

231
00:28:57,557 --> 00:28:59,547
We're moving out!

232
00:29:15,536 --> 00:29:18,466
The evil spirits left the man ...

233
00:29:18,826 --> 00:29:21,746
and entered the pigs ...

234
00:29:22,906 --> 00:29:26,256
and the herd ran down a sharp
slope, into the water ...

235
00:29:26,376 --> 00:29:28,336
and found their destruction.

236
00:29:28,986 --> 00:29:31,286
The Gospel of Luke ...

237
00:29:35,646 --> 00:29:36,596
What is this?

238
00:29:46,386 --> 00:29:47,986
Ready to roll?

239
00:29:53,565 --> 00:29:55,645
On cue, as always ...
 
240
00:29:55,785 --> 00:29:57,565
Listen, how did you get here?

241
00:29:57,635 --> 00:30:00,235
Are you dead?

242
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:01,705
Didn't I warn you ...

243
00:30:04,775 --> 00:30:05,845
No, I'm alive.

244
00:30:05,965 --> 00:30:07,845
General Belov sent me.

245
00:30:07,915 --> 00:30:10,945
They have a machine that can
send people over here.

246
00:30:12,395 --> 00:30:15,135
Are they crazy there,
at the 6th Division?!

247
00:30:15,185 --> 00:30:18,025
No one returns alive from this place.

248
00:30:18,105 --> 00:30:20,485
Now they do.

249
00:30:20,525 --> 00:30:22,425
How did you find me?

250
00:30:22,465 --> 00:30:23,675
We all sensed you.

251
00:30:23,735 --> 00:30:27,825
Remember the mental frequency
synchronization exercises at school?

252
00:30:27,924 --> 00:30:31,504
We may be dead, but we still know
everything we learned while alive.

253
00:30:37,244 --> 00:30:38,274
Below.

254
00:30:59,184 --> 00:31:00,274
So frightening, so gloomy ...

255
00:31:00,324 --> 00:31:02,594
And yet, so beautiful.

256
00:31:03,144 --> 00:31:05,354
What a strange place.

257
00:31:05,883 --> 00:31:08,863
Yeah, not the best place for an school reunion.

258
00:31:08,963 --> 00:31:10,913
That is the Valley of the Shadows ...

259
00:31:11,043 --> 00:31:15,263
where the spirits of fallen
warriors go after death.

260
00:31:15,463 --> 00:31:19,543
They say there are other lands beyond those
mountains, but no one knows for sure.

261
00:31:19,863 --> 00:31:22,263
There is no way out of the 
Valley of the Shadows.

262
00:31:26,383 --> 00:31:29,253
So, why are you here?

263
00:31:30,063 --> 00:31:34,233
After waiting 700 years, Von Wolff is about ...

264
00:31:34,383 --> 00:31:37,333
to break the threshold between the worlds.

265
00:31:38,323 --> 00:31:42,033
He reached an agreement with the Ahnenerbe ...

266
00:31:42,113 --> 00:31:44,113
and will fight on their side.

267
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:46,112
Unbelievable.

268
00:31:46,182 --> 00:31:48,982
The threshold has not been broken for centuries!

269
00:31:49,652 --> 00:31:53,222
The dead versus the living ...
The living have no chance ...

270
00:31:53,902 --> 00:31:58,172
Von Wolff has become an extremely
powerful demon over the years.

271
00:31:58,262 --> 00:32:01,082
His hatred has great destructive power.

272
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:05,922
Once the Nazis can control that power,
they'll rule the world of the living.

273
00:32:06,082 --> 00:32:10,082
I've come for you.
We must stop Von Wolff.

274
00:32:10,192 --> 00:32:12,322
I can't do it on my own!

275
00:32:12,382 --> 00:32:14,152
Nadya, don't you get it?

276
00:32:14,172 --> 00:32:17,942
We were killed, we are out of the game.

277
00:32:18,092 --> 00:32:20,432
We can not return.
It's forbidden ...

278
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:23,311
If you don't intervene, millions
of people will die!

279
00:32:23,421 --> 00:32:27,071
The world of the living and the world of
the dead will become one!

280
00:32:27,211 --> 00:32:29,281
That will be ...

281
00:32:29,731 --> 00:32:31,091
the apocalypse.

282
00:32:36,791 --> 00:32:40,291
Listen, you were killed
and I kept living.

283
00:32:41,311 --> 00:32:47,041
But I come asking you to help us, 
the living, win this ruthless war.

284
00:32:47,411 --> 00:32:50,681
Let everyone decide for themselves ...

285
00:32:51,201 --> 00:32:53,621
I, for one, am ready.

286
00:32:53,661 --> 00:32:55,521
It is my war, too.

287
00:32:55,581 --> 00:32:59,071
I can't just sit and watch
as things get worse there.

288
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:02,630
So, guys, hark back to the
old days of yore.

289
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:04,690
We weren't killed in vain.

290
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,410
Well, Nadya, how typical ...

291
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:09,940
don't you just love being the
center of attention.

292
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:15,940
Okay, I'm in.  I don't want to miss
an opportunity to kick some Nazi ass.

293
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,840
And what about me?

294
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:21,070
I'm with you guys!

295
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,930
I knew you'd agree.

296
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:26,510
First Squadron is back together,
just like old times.

297
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:32,240
Comrade General, Sputnik is overheating.

298
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:34,170
Let's bring her back!

299
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:40,759
What is this?

300
00:33:40,879 --> 00:33:42,269
What's going on, Nadya?

301
00:33:43,309 --> 00:33:44,109
The signal!

302
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:46,279
We must hurry to the Ferris wheel!

303
00:33:46,339 --> 00:33:48,279
What's taking her so long?

304
00:33:50,209 --> 00:33:52,029
We're going to lose her.

305
00:33:52,069 --> 00:33:52,909
Nadya ...

306
00:33:53,719 --> 00:33:54,979
Come on, girl!

307
00:34:00,299 --> 00:34:03,859
Come back here when the
amusement park runs again.

308
00:34:04,499 --> 00:34:06,529
That will be the signal to cross.

309
00:34:06,749 --> 00:34:10,329
We'll be there.
See you on the other side!

310
00:34:14,358 --> 00:34:17,268
You had me worried sick.

311
00:34:22,898 --> 00:34:30,078
Congratulations -- you're the first human ever
to return alive from the world of the dead.

312
00:34:30,178 --> 00:34:34,448
Now, tell me what happened.
Did you see them?

313
00:34:35,008 --> 00:34:37,718
Von Wolff is ready to cross.

314
00:34:38,048 --> 00:34:41,058
But the First Squadron will fight!

315
00:34:41,268 --> 00:34:43,288
I have a surprise for you.

316
00:34:46,278 --> 00:34:47,368
Oh, hello.

317
00:34:48,048 --> 00:34:52,428
You see, like I said, I'm safe and sound.

318
00:34:58,557 --> 00:35:01,257
It was a close call, but ...

319
00:35:01,697 --> 00:35:04,267
actually, those two were after you.

320
00:35:06,307 --> 00:35:08,347
Back to business ...

321
00:35:08,597 --> 00:35:10,937
700 years after his death ...

322
00:35:10,977 --> 00:35:14,157
Von Wolff will cross into our
world at the Moment of Truth ...

323
00:35:14,417 --> 00:35:17,037
but we don't know precisely
when and where it will happen.

324
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:17,817
The Moment of Truth!

325
00:35:17,957 --> 00:35:22,517
That's what Von Wolff told his knights.

326
00:35:22,807 --> 00:35:24,247
What does it mean?

327
00:35:24,837 --> 00:35:28,437
Moments of Truth are the most critical ...

328
00:35:28,576 --> 00:35:32,376
decisive moments, when
actions of one man ...

329
00:35:32,516 --> 00:35:37,626
determine the outcome of a
battle or an entire war.

330
00:35:38,286 --> 00:35:42,046
Moments of Truth are instants ...

331
00:35:42,206 --> 00:35:45,556
imperceptible to mortals, when
creatures from the other world ...

332
00:35:46,176 --> 00:35:51,326
may enter our world and interfere
with the natural course of time.

333
00:35:51,976 --> 00:35:56,096
Moments of Truth always have and
always will exist in history ...

334
00:35:56,256 --> 00:35:59,026
but only those with a rare gift
can foresee and endure them.

335
00:35:59,706 --> 00:36:03,366
And you, Nadya, have that gift.

336
00:36:08,475 --> 00:36:10,055
Herr Obergruppenfuhrer.

337
00:36:11,095 --> 00:36:12,815
Here come our beauties!

338
00:36:12,845 --> 00:36:14,745
Any good news?

339
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:18,865
The girl was spotted on the Eastern Front ...

340
00:36:19,105 --> 00:36:24,095
a clairvoyant, working for Soviet intelligence.

341
00:36:24,385 --> 00:36:27,705
Despite our efforts,
we failed to eliminate her.

342
00:36:31,905 --> 00:36:36,715
Could you, please, get rid of this
6th Division clairvoyant?

343
00:36:36,855 --> 00:36:39,875
It must be done before the Moment of Truth.

344
00:36:39,985 --> 00:36:42,555
Tomorrow morning you should be in Moscow.

345
00:36:42,684 --> 00:36:43,914
You are dismissed.

346
00:36:43,914 --> 00:36:44,354
Yes, sir!
Retire.

347
00:36:50,714 --> 00:36:51,944
This is what we know ...

348
00:36:51,994 --> 00:36:57,274
a large number of troops are concentrated
on both sides of the lake shore.

349
00:37:00,674 --> 00:37:05,364
Each side has tried to attack
but every attempt has failed.

350
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:09,734
It is around here that the 
Moment of Truth will occur.

351
00:37:10,164 --> 00:37:14,474
The commander in your dream is the only one
who will dare to rise from the trenches ...

352
00:37:14,724 --> 00:37:18,054
and lead the soldiers in in the attack.

353
00:37:18,214 --> 00:37:21,684
At the Moment of Truth, Von Wolff
will try to behead him.

354
00:37:21,863 --> 00:37:24,283
Should our attack not take place ...

355
00:37:24,443 --> 00:37:27,953
the Germans will launch a counter-
offensive and break our frontline.

356
00:37:28,383 --> 00:37:33,653
Try again, maybe you will see his
face, or perhaps his platoon ...

357
00:37:34,263 --> 00:37:34,953
I'm trying ...

358
00:37:52,633 --> 00:37:54,243
I can not see.

359
00:37:54,293 --> 00:37:56,793
You're too tired.
You just need to rest.

360
00:37:56,913 --> 00:38:02,183
A driver will take you to the barracks.

361
00:38:02,972 --> 00:38:06,532
Get some sleep, recuperate, and it will work ...

362
00:38:13,692 --> 00:38:15,052
I know you.

363
00:38:16,022 --> 00:38:17,602
You were a circus performer.

364
00:38:17,662 --> 00:38:19,192
I drove you once, before the war.

365
00:38:22,952 --> 00:38:26,212
I also remember your parents.
They were wonderful people ...

366
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:28,762
May they rest in peace ...

367
00:38:28,882 --> 00:38:31,312
Please, tell me about my parents.

368
00:38:31,432 --> 00:38:33,062
I hardly remember them.

369
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:34,202
You don't remember?

370
00:38:34,242 --> 00:38:36,822
But only a year has passed since  ...

371
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:22,380
" CAPTAIN ALEXANDER NEMOV, THE
SOLE SURVIVOR OF HIS SUBDIVISION ...
 
372
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:25,890
HAS BEEN TREATED AT A NEARBY HOSPITAL
FOLLOWING A MASSIVE ENEMY AIR RAID ...

373
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:31,920
NOW HOPES TO RETURN TO THE FRONT
LINES OF COMBAT TO FIGHT THE ENEMY "

374
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:47,230
The sole survivor!

375
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:51,250
This is the subject of the Moment of Truth!
I found him.

376
00:39:51,819 --> 00:39:53,539
It's me, I found him.

377
00:39:53,569 --> 00:39:55,959
Captain Alexander Nemov.

378
00:39:57,279 --> 00:39:58,049
Yes.

379
00:39:58,359 --> 00:40:01,269
I need the exact location of his regiment.

380
00:40:01,329 --> 00:40:04,999
No, I'm fine, but the driver was killed.
Someone is following me.

381
00:40:05,289 --> 00:40:08,249
I understand.  I will call
you from the station.

382
00:41:01,608 --> 00:41:03,698
Can I get over there before the fork?

383
00:42:32,375 --> 00:42:38,015
Soldiers retreating from their positions
without an order are traitors.

384
00:42:38,415 --> 00:42:43,215
Cowards and deserters will
be executed on the spot.

385
00:42:43,265 --> 00:42:46,815
The enemy will be defeated!  We shall prevail!

386
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:03,404
Here we go.

387
00:43:03,574 --> 00:43:05,594
I hope he's there ...

388
00:43:09,644 --> 00:43:11,334
Go away, we're closed!

389
00:43:13,264 --> 00:43:15,044
What do you want?

390
00:43:16,534 --> 00:43:17,464
Can't you read ...

391
00:43:20,504 --> 00:43:21,854
What are you doing?

392
00:43:21,884 --> 00:43:24,614
Everybody wants something from the Hunchback ...

393
00:43:24,834 --> 00:43:26,454
I've told you I have nothing to sell!

394
00:43:26,844 --> 00:43:29,134
Listen, Hunchback, we have no time.

395
00:43:29,324 --> 00:43:31,254
How about a trade?

396
00:43:34,064 --> 00:43:36,524
6th Division of the Russian Military Intelligence.

397
00:43:37,103 --> 00:43:38,453
A rarity.

398
00:43:39,013 --> 00:43:40,793
Okay.

399
00:43:49,943 --> 00:43:51,213
Damn!

400
00:43:52,583 --> 00:43:53,843
Wow!

401
00:43:53,893 --> 00:43:55,803
That's more like it!

402
00:43:57,473 --> 00:43:59,173
The latest models on the market.

403
00:43:59,243 --> 00:44:02,213
Russia, Germany, Japan.

404
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:06,303
All calibrated and in perfect working condition.

405
00:44:07,283 --> 00:44:10,433
Let me check.

406
00:44:14,292 --> 00:44:15,922
Was that necessary?

407
00:44:52,671 --> 00:44:54,051
I hope this works.

408
00:45:12,581 --> 00:45:14,271
Really?   Here?

409
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:16,461
This is the only pavilion with lights on.

410
00:45:17,921 --> 00:45:20,301
This will be the gateway to Nadya's subconscious.

411
00:45:20,521 --> 00:45:21,231
Come on.

412
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:31,940
Get in, she's calling uss.

413
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:38,020
This tunnel should lead us
to the world of the living.

414
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:02,550
Stealing apples is not okay.

415
00:46:06,919 --> 00:46:07,929
It's accelerating!

416
00:46:11,449 --> 00:46:13,429
Hurry up, faster.

417
00:47:16,678 --> 00:47:19,348
They didn't come.

418
00:47:22,337 --> 00:47:23,677
Knights ...

419
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:26,277
you are all part of the
most glorious of battles.

420
00:47:26,407 --> 00:47:28,787
Your names will remain anonymous ...

421
00:47:28,837 --> 00:47:31,557
but your deads will live for eternity!

422
00:47:47,477 --> 00:47:48,357
Here goes ...

423
00:47:48,627 --> 00:47:49,847
It's starting ...

424
00:48:42,635 --> 00:48:44,195
Some like it hot, huh!

425
00:48:52,365 --> 00:48:53,605
Not a moment too soon.

426
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:03,585
Leo!

427
00:49:56,123 --> 00:49:57,163
Nadya!!

428
00:50:06,013 --> 00:50:08,793
Welcome to the Valley of the Shadows.

429
00:50:12,053 --> 00:50:13,413
Nadya!

430
00:50:34,772 --> 00:50:36,222
What just happened?

431
00:50:42,542 --> 00:50:45,202
Did Nadya just whack Von Wolff?

432
00:50:46,082 --> 00:50:49,802
Bon voyage, weirdos!

433
00:51:00,812 --> 00:51:01,922
Attack!

434
00:51:12,731 --> 00:51:13,231
Fire!

435
00:51:13,301 --> 00:51:14,021
Fire!

436
00:51:23,241 --> 00:51:24,271
Speaking!

437
00:51:31,611 --> 00:51:32,961
Prepare an airplane now.

438
00:51:33,661 --> 00:51:36,161
I will pick Nadya up in person.

439
00:52:00,210 --> 00:52:01,660
That's not him!

440
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:03,970
He escaped ...
