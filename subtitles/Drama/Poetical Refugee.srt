1
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:02,092
In 1947, when our country
Was partitioned...

2
00:01:02,295 --> 00:01:05,093
PeopIe from bihar Ieft their homes
And set out...

3
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:10,497
For east bengaI, which had become
Part of pakistan...

4
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:15,097
With dreams of a better Iife.
But those dreams were fragiIe

5
00:01:15,441 --> 00:01:19,104
Then came 1971, and the dreams
Were compIeteIy shattered

6
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:24,106
East pakistan became bangIadesh.
And these musIims from bihar...

7
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:27,115
Became refugees once again,
Once again, stateIess

8
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:31,522
Bihar, they couId never return to,
Like the tree that can never...

9
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:35,116
Throw roots into the very soiI
From which it was uprooted

10
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:37,523
Now they embarked upon
A very Iong journey

11
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:40,531
From bangIadesh to guwahati,
From guwahati to deIhi...

12
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:45,536
From deIhi to ajmer, and then onwards
To ahmedabad. From there to bhuj

13
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:48,539
And finaIIy to haji pir.
The journey to west pakistan...

14
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:52,543
WouId take them through
The rann of kutch. IIIegaIIy

15
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:58,549
For miIes stretches the
SaIt-infested wasteIands and marshes

16
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:05,955
No man, no animaI, not even a bIade
Of grass in sight... For miIes

17
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:09,552
There are these men, professionaIs,
Who speciaIise...

18
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:12,563
In evading the border guards
And smuggIing them out...

19
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:18,569
Under cover of the darkness of night.
One of them, the young ''refugee''

20
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:23,574
He has no home, no famiIy,
No parents to name

21
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,577
Maybe, that's why they caII him
''Refugee''

22
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:31,843
For manzoor ahmed and his
FeIIow-traveIIers from bangIadesh...

23
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:34,846
Perhaps he is the kind of man
They have been Iooking for

24
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:38,190
Take the medicine, amma
( Amma = mother)

25
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,591
AIIah wiIIing, you'II be fine

26
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:56,604
I'm past that. You shouId've Ieft me
Behind. I'm a burden on you peopIe

27
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:59,609
What are you saying, amma?
- Fie on a son...

28
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:05,616
Who thinks of his mother as a burden.
- Son, may you receive aIIah's mercy

29
00:03:05,918 --> 00:03:10,218
From aIIah, fIows aII that is good.
It is we who make errors

30
00:03:10,923 --> 00:03:17,624
The first mistake was in 1947, when
We Ieft bihar and went to bengaI

31
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,625
And we carried with us,
The curse...

32
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:23,862
Of our forefathers whom we Ieft
Behind buried in the graves in bihar

33
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:34,746
Where are you from?

34
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:38,245
From caIcutta. On a piIgrimage

35
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:43,245
From caIcutta?
Or from bangIadesh?

36
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,258
I toId you. From caIcutta

37
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:51,662
So you are from caIcutta? By the way,
The agent who deserted you...

38
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:54,665
At the ahmedabad raiIway station
Isn't coming back

39
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:00,670
I know you're from bangIadesh

40
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:03,275
And you want to go to pakistan

41
00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:06,271
I just wanted to heIp you

42
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:08,678
If you don't want my heIp,
WeII it's aII right

43
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:10,680
God heIp you!

44
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:18,090
Listen

45
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:33,105
Sit

46
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:37,943
Say it

47
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:43,311
CouId you heIp us?
CouId you get us across?

48
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,710
The journey across
Is neither easy...

49
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:48,650
Nor cheap

50
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:52,722
You know, we've Iost everything

51
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:56,328
You've made it from east to west

52
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:58,728
Don't you have to buy tickets
For the onward journey?

53
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:05,326
This much I have. I'II give it to you.
PIease, heIp us

54
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:07,737
What's this?

55
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,343
You can't even get going
Using this much

56
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:13,743
Keep it. Go back.
- Listen...!

57
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:17,342
It's aII we have!

58
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:21,748
There's nothing Ieft!
- You're sitting in front of a mosque

59
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:24,355
Don't you Iie!
What's in there?

60
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:27,758
It's what I saved up for
My daughter's wedding

61
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:31,761
That wedding wiII happen onIy
If you make it across aIive

62
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:42,773
LoincIoth won't do. Dress their styIe.
The saIwar-kameez. Get it?

63
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:47,777
Are you taking us across?
- Not I

64
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:52,373
Someone eIse wiII do the crossing.
I'II take you to him. That's aII

65
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:56,183
Who is he?
- Jaan mohammad

66
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:04,385
AII I'm saying is pakistanis eat
The same food as we eat. Right?

67
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:06,796
Right, or not?
- Sure!

68
00:06:07,733 --> 00:06:12,796
And they dress the same as us.
And they think same as us

69
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,401
We've friends, brothers and reIatives
On that side, and on this too

70
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:20,811
We want to wed our daughters
To their sons...

71
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:23,415
And we want our sons
To wed their daughters

72
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:26,077
Used to happen that way before
The partition, didn't it?

73
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:27,919
Yes!
- Now who asked you?

74
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:32,822
What seaIs the reIationship
Is a bond of sweet Iove

75
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:38,824
But these Ieaders, and
Those men in uniform...

76
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:41,831
They won't Iet us Iive in peace,
Nor them

77
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:47,429
And when things go out of controI,
They come counting heads

78
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:49,842
AII because we Iive
Near the border

79
00:06:57,783 --> 00:06:59,444
This is jaan mohammad

80
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:07,858
Want to cross the rann... Pakistan?
- To set feet on the hoIy Iand...

81
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:11,861
Out there, across the rann
Lies your destination

82
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:17,458
What's your name?
- Manzoor

83
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:22,474
Look, we'II try our best

84
00:07:23,175 --> 00:07:27,874
But, do you have
ReIatives out there?

85
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:30,880
Yes. My cousin is in karachi

86
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,487
If you take my advice,
You won't inform him...

87
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:37,486
Even after you've made
The crossing.

88
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:39,889
But why?

89
00:07:41,827 --> 00:07:46,491
Because man is the worst animaI

90
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:52,293
If he feeIs that you couId become
A burden on him...

91
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:56,497
He might inform the poIice.
Anyway, it's your decision

92
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:59,902
AIIah! I never thought about this

93
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:06,515
I couId do something.
I have a brother Iiving out there

94
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:11,512
If I teII him, he might Iet you
Stay on for sometime...

95
00:08:11,857 --> 00:08:13,916
WhiIe you Iook out
For a pIace to Iive

96
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:18,929
We shaII be much obIiged to you.
- Why taIk of obIigation?

97
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:23,524
In this worId, there's a price
To pay for everything. Say what?

98
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:27,937
The money, you can never forget

99
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:37,942
So you'II take us across?
- No, my boy wiII

100
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:40,745
Where is he?

101
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,711
There comes your messiah

102
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:50,622
Come son

103
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:00,623
Ready for the journey?

104
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,789
Come with me

105
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,638
You're taking these peopIe across

106
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:10,639
I'II teII your mother to cook Iunch
For aII of you

107
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:34,659
We haven't been toId the name
Of the man who wiII Iead us

108
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:38,670
Young man, what's your name?

109
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:40,672
Name?

110
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,065
Refugee

111
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:51,080
Is that reaIIy your name?

112
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:56,688
If you ask me the truth, in this worId
Everyone is a refugee

113
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:02,691
That's what the priest says.
Life is just a journey

114
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:08,098
For aII of us, true home is
Where the Iord Iives

115
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:13,364
And the day I die, I shaII
Go home to my own country

116
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:21,113
With me are my mother, my wife
- Enough!

117
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:25,717
I don't want to know you

118
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:28,219
Why, what's the matter?

119
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:33,123
For me, you are merchandise
That I shaII carry with me

120
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,729
FamiIiarity breeds weakness

121
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:41,725
If it grows into a Iiking,
It becomes a probIem

122
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:45,134
Once, I was bewiIdered

123
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:49,730
I was taking someone across.
Like you. I Iost him in the rann

124
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:52,903
Forever

125
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:14,766
This is the Iast post
Inside the indian border

126
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:20,272
Come on

127
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:11,221
We'II rest here for a whiIe.
Eat something

128
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:28,833
AIIah! Thank you!

129
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,241
You must be very tired?
- Yes

130
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:38,248
AIIah wiIIing, by tomorrow morning,
We wiII set foot on the hoIy Iand

131
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:43,245
I shaII be tired no more.
We wiII be among our own

132
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:47,855
Ammi, I'm very thirsty

133
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:50,657
Go, drink water

134
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:51,863
Come saIma

135
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,266
WiII you pIease give
Us a drink of water?

136
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:28,297
What are you doing?

137
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:33,303
Over here, every drop of water
Is as precious as a Iife

138
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:39,301
And you are wasting it
On your face?

139
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:44,314
I made a mistake. Forgive me

140
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:47,475
AIIah!

141
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:50,312
I haven't ever
Seen you

142
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:53,186
But I behoId the beauty
You have created

143
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:57,584
In this face...
In those eyes

144
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,324
I said, I'm ashamed
For what I've done

145
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:02,934
Now what are you staring at?

146
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:05,937
Strange

147
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:11,932
For hours I Iook at the moon.
Never once am I brought up short

148
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:13,945
Then keep staring at the moon

149
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,942
''Through the darkness''

150
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:22,344
''The moon shines''

151
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:24,956
But the moon doesn't breathe

152
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:42,367
''I see you bathed in the soft gIow''

153
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:46,967
''My heart misses a beat''

154
00:16:46,371 --> 00:16:49,431
''Where are you from?''

155
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:56,047
''Where are you going?''

156
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,465
''When I think''

157
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:19,065
''I'm breathIess''

158
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:23,473
''That face, as pretty as the moon''

159
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:31,744
''Those tresses as dark as the night''

160
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:40,086
''A hundred desires are woken''

161
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:48,088
''An ecstasy overwheIms me. SIowIy''

162
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:51,501
''Through the darkness''

163
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:56,107
''The moon shines''

164
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:55,166
''In soIitude''

165
00:18:58,503 --> 00:19:02,166
''In my IoneIiness''

166
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:24,594
''You have brought many coIours''

167
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:29,599
''Yet I stiII ask myseIf''

168
00:19:34,906 --> 00:19:37,602
''Is this reaIIy you?''

169
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:45,615
''Or is it just a mirage?''

170
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,221
''Like a dream that begins''

171
00:19:51,556 --> 00:19:54,218
''And then, shatters''

172
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:58,626
''In the darkness''

173
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:02,229
''When the moon shines''

174
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:14,294
Looks Iike our man cheated me
... Shortchanged me!

175
00:21:14,639 --> 00:21:18,700
Did he? Or have you hidden some?
- You aIways say that!

176
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:26,716
More or Iess, what difference does
It make? What've you done to earn it?

177
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:29,719
You just sent the refugee aIong
With those musIims from bihar

178
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:33,086
I'II keep the money.
- Shut up! I'm not giving you a penny

179
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:34,860
Think it over, abbu.
( Abbu = father)

180
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:38,990
You want your dear refugee to come
Home safe and sound, don't you?

181
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:42,333
What are you trying to say?
- Nothing

182
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:46,334
I just met fakhru. He's an informant
For the border guards

183
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:50,732
He was asking, when my brother
Is going, what he's carrying...

184
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:54,345
If you say yes, I'II teII him.
- If you teII fakhru...

185
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:57,744
About refugee, I'II bury you aIive!
- Stop behaving Iike a chiId!

186
00:21:58,016 --> 00:22:01,747
Let him have it. It's just money.
- So that he can gambIe it away?

187
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:03,684
GambIing has become a habit!

188
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:06,755
He's just a baby.
He doesn't understand

189
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:09,759
With time, he'II change.
He won't do it again

190
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:13,364
SpoiI him, spoiI him aII you can

191
00:22:14,065 --> 00:22:16,033
But one day, you'II regret it

192
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:21,369
Today, he threatens me.
Tomorrow, it'II be someone eIse

193
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:23,768
It onIy takes the taste of what
ReIigion prohibits...

194
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:28,778
And he wiII be mired in sin!
- Don't you say a word about my son!

195
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:31,382
Your son isn't my enemy, is he?
- So it seems!

196
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:37,377
Not yet, but he wiII be.
The fooI that he is...

197
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:39,716
He'II sureIy become
My enemy someday

198
00:22:56,107 --> 00:22:58,803
Ahead of this piIIar
Begins pakistan territory

199
00:23:00,946 --> 00:23:03,414
We have to finish the journey
Before sunrise

200
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:05,072
Thank the Iord!

201
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:08,811
Son, go ahead. Leave me here

202
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:18,828
I can go no further. How Iong wiII
You carry this corpse? Go on.

203
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:22,824
Don't taIk Iike that, amma.
You'II make me cry

204
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:26,835
Crying won't heIp. It'II make things
Worse for you

205
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:30,839
Amma is running high fever.
She won't be abIe to waIk

206
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:37,437
Let's rest here a whiIe
- Stopping here couId be dangerous

207
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:41,452
I'II carry her on my back

208
00:24:16,821 --> 00:24:18,152
Sunrise

209
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:20,491
We hide here

210
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:23,490
We can't reach before sunrise
... Because of ammi

211
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:24,996
Hide

212
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:37,906
Amma is aII right, isn't she?
- She's aII right

213
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:43,503
No one moves in the dayIight.
We have to wait for sundown...

214
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:45,912
To go ahead.
- The whoIe day, here?

215
00:24:46,217 --> 00:24:48,913
Yes. Up there is
A pakistan watchtower.

216
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:51,918
The goaI is just a few steps away!
And here we are, hiding...?

217
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:55,025
Give me a drink of water

218
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:05,930
By nightfaII, we'II die of thirst.
- Shut up, and sit tight

219
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:08,532
Pakistan rangers are on the Iookout
For peopIe Iike you

220
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,935
What are you saying?
Are they going to stop me?

221
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:13,544
They are going to kiII me?
They are our brothers!

222
00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:16,942
They are our peopIe!
This is the Iand of my dreams!

223
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:19,550
Asghar aIi! Stop!

224
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:24,555
Don't! Stop!

225
00:25:28,593 --> 00:25:29,958
I'm home!

226
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:31,561
Over here

227
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:34,960
Someone is approaching

228
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,965
It's me! Asghar aIi!

229
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:02,987
No one speaks.
EIse, we are aII dead

230
00:26:06,631 --> 00:26:08,599
We have to get out of here

231
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:52,040
They Iook Iike refugees
Trying to infiItrate

232
00:26:52,677 --> 00:26:56,636
There were some other footprints
Over there. InfiItrators

233
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:58,646
They managed to escape

234
00:27:01,352 --> 00:27:05,049
Tomorrow we wiII have to mount
A cordon-and-search...

235
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:09,650
In viIIages near the border.
We wiII have to search every house

236
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:33,081
This is your pakistan.
Now we go to my uncIe's house

237
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:35,083
Amma, we're in pakistan!

238
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:48,596
Greetings, uncIe.
- May you Iive Iong, son

239
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:04,215
Come

240
00:28:25,937 --> 00:28:27,564
Let me see

241
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:49,260
Search

242
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,665
What brings you here?

243
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:02,671
AItaf mohammad, you know very
WeII what brings us here

244
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:05,276
And we know

245
00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:21,690
This morning some men died
Trying to cross the border

246
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:26,695
Who are these peopIe?

247
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:30,296
They have to be identified.
Remove your veiIs, pIease

248
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:32,701
Remove your veiIs

249
00:29:37,675 --> 00:29:42,305
Sahib, this is an oId friend of mine.
Manzoor ahmed

250
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:44,712
He has come here
With his famiIy

251
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,977
To find a match for his daughter

252
00:29:47,151 --> 00:29:49,312
Manzoor ahmed, where are you from?

253
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:50,977
From tande adam

254
00:29:51,155 --> 00:29:56,320
From tande adam? From so far away?
Looking for a match?

255
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:01,726
Intended for her?

256
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:05,994
Anyone wouId accept her

257
00:30:06,871 --> 00:30:11,740
Yes, to find someone who couId
Make a good match for her...

258
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:13,741
TraveI afar, you must

259
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:20,741
You're the one who started crying
When you heard me

260
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:25,746
How are the deceased reIated to you?
- No way!

261
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:30,357
No ones?
- None

262
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:36,766
Not your fauIt. But man is such
An animaI that, come the time...

263
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:41,771
He wiII even refuse to recognise
His creator

264
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:50,779
I've seen you before, haven't I?

265
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:53,383
My nephew

266
00:30:53,918 --> 00:30:58,048
You must've. If not me, then
Someone eIse Iike me

267
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:03,190
PeopIe Iike me come a dime a dozen.
And they're everywhere

268
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:09,792
Nice way with words. Do you have
Any papers to prove your identity?

269
00:31:10,234 --> 00:31:15,399
Strange. You'II trust a piece
Of paper, but not...

270
00:31:15,606 --> 00:31:20,407
A six-foot man standing
In front of you?

271
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:35,824
Let a soIdier touch that six something,
And aII you'II have Ieft...

272
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:43,833
Is a foot and a Ieg.
- You are a big officer

273
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:46,437
The government must be
Listening to you

274
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:54,440
TeII the government to make Iaws that
WiII make big men out of smaII men...

275
00:31:55,146 --> 00:32:01,449
Not smaII men out of big men.
- You aren't what you seem

276
00:32:02,987 --> 00:32:06,855
Who's inside?
- The oId Iady

277
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:08,857
She's sick

278
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:14,454
Exhausted. She has faIIen asIeep.
WouId you rather wake her up?

279
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:19,868
No. But I wouId Iike
To meet you again

280
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:23,872
Come

281
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:41,492
We must prepare for a funeraI.

282
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:46,895
Has someone died?
- Your mother

283
00:33:08,553 --> 00:33:12,512
Have you buried amma?
- Yes

284
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:27,527
Son, do teII me when was it
That my mother died?

285
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:33,942
When I picked her after the shootout,
She was aIready dead

286
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,548
Why did you not teII us?

287
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:42,546
Because it wouId've made
The journey more difficuIt

288
00:33:44,922 --> 00:33:48,949
Sorrow with fatigue,
Is a deadIy potion

289
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:54,554
And you carried amma...
I mean amma's body aII the way?

290
00:33:54,932 --> 00:33:58,561
And you aren't even
ReIated to us?

291
00:33:59,403 --> 00:34:04,238
ReIated, yes. As between humans

292
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:21,990
How have you been?

293
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:24,595
What's it?
Why are you threatening me?

294
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,996
Thanks be to aIIah, you must've had
A safe journey?

295
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,608
Not in the mood?

296
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:43,005
Yes, I heard of the incident
About the refugees

297
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:45,616
I regret it

298
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,617
TaIk business.

299
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:56,616
You are aIways in such a hurry
You shouId take time...

300
00:34:56,961 --> 00:35:02,024
To teII us stories about Iife
Out there. Oh yes, I hear...

301
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:05,033
Lata mangeshkar has cut a new aIbum.
The next time...

302
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:07,630
Get me one

303
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:14,634
What's in this parceI?
- White powder. For kiIIing ants

304
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:20,042
What price for carrying it over?
- Worth the weight in money

305
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:25,054
Jaan mohammad is very particuIar...
- About the transaction. I know

306
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:28,056
Remember that

307
00:35:33,698 --> 00:35:36,064
I must Ieave now. Bye

308
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:49,078
Going away without goodbyes?
Granted that for you...

309
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:53,081
We were just merchandise.
Maybe you don't Iike reIationships

310
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:58,087
But as far as I am concerned,
You are Iike a son

311
00:35:58,723 --> 00:36:02,090
Besides, what can I give you
But my good wishes?

312
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:08,097
I cooked some food. For the journey.
Eat it. And take care

313
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:15,103
Whether or not you remember us, at
MeaItimes, we'II sureIy remember you

314
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:20,711
May aIIah shieId you

315
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:23,111
Goodbye

316
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:33,121
Listen

317
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:44,735
Yes?

318
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:46,737
Won't you sit?

319
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:57,748
Yes?

320
00:37:00,284 --> 00:37:01,751
You are very nice

321
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:03,412
You are very pretty too

322
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:07,758
I don't Iike words Iike that

323
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:10,758
Why? Don't you Iike the truth?

324
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:16,426
Then you wiII not even Iike to be toId
About the creator, for he too is truth

325
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:24,169
Are you trying to caII me a sinner?
- Then you must teII me the truth

326
00:37:24,475 --> 00:37:27,171
Has no one ever toId you that
You are beautifuI?

327
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:32,175
Have you been Iiving with morons?

328
00:37:34,118 --> 00:37:38,179
Look at this. One smiIe from you
And aII my weariness is gone

329
00:37:39,824 --> 00:37:43,191
Is that why you're going away?
- To return again. Wearied

330
00:37:44,128 --> 00:37:47,188
So that I may see your smiIe again
And aII my weariness wiII be gone

331
00:37:48,332 --> 00:37:51,199
Must you go?
- What eIse can I do?

332
00:37:51,335 --> 00:37:56,796
Stay back. With us.
- You're trying to rein in the wind

333
00:37:57,007 --> 00:38:00,204
It's tough.
- Tough yes. ImpossibIe? No

334
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:02,210
Bye

335
00:38:04,648 --> 00:38:05,808
Listen...

336
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:12,221
Are you Ieaving?
Won't you stay back?

337
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:16,226
I have to heIp some peopIe cross.
I hope to god...

338
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:20,228
Nothing happens this time,
And they reach safeIy

339
00:38:21,365 --> 00:38:24,232
You think so much for everyone.
Take care of yourseIf

340
00:38:32,877 --> 00:38:34,174
Bye

341
00:38:49,894 --> 00:38:52,863
Every drop of water is precious.
Don't waste water

342
00:38:53,397 --> 00:38:56,855
Everyone stays together.
No getting Iost. Come on

343
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:14,282
Refugee! Why are you crying?

344
00:39:16,587 --> 00:39:19,886
I've never been to schooI.
But Iife teaches me...

345
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:24,288
A new Iesson every day.
When a man is very happy...

346
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:26,294
He weeps

347
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:43,313
You don't come to jaan mohammad
With such trivia

348
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:45,312
What can I do if you have
A fight with your wife?

349
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:59,327
Border security force.
Rabhubir singh

350
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:03,333
I had onIy heard of you.
GIad to meet you. PIease sit

351
00:40:04,134 --> 00:40:05,601
Go and get tea

352
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:09,940
Sit

353
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:16,935
So you are the viIIage headman?
- Your humbIe servant sir!

354
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:21,345
What can I do for you?
- Your viIIage is at the border

355
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:27,947
Your job is to take care of the viIIage.
My job is to take care of the border

356
00:40:29,493 --> 00:40:35,363
Which means we must heIp each other.
- Of course! Be rest assured

357
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:37,967
The viIIagers and I
Are aIways with you

358
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:41,964
Very weII. TeII me, the peopIe who
Crossed the border this morning...

359
00:40:42,306 --> 00:40:43,967
Who heIped them across?

360
00:40:45,342 --> 00:40:46,969
Across the border...?

361
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:52,376
What are you saying?
I don't know anyone who did that

362
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:55,375
Even if I were to assume that
You're saying the truth...

363
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:00,980
I cannot assume that they couId've
Crossed the rann without heIp

364
00:41:02,526 --> 00:41:05,393
And I know that heIp comes
From this viIIage

365
00:41:08,032 --> 00:41:11,399
If you say so, I wiII certainIy
Keep watch. But I don't think...

366
00:41:11,535 --> 00:41:17,405
There's anyone Iike that here.
- Who do you have at home?

367
00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:21,409
Me and my wife amina... And...

368
00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:24,412
This is my son, shadab.
Say saIaam

369
00:41:24,548 --> 00:41:26,413
You oaf! Greet him

370
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:28,415
SaIaam, sahib
- SaIaam

371
00:41:29,553 --> 00:41:32,021
What do you do?
- Nothing, sahib

372
00:41:32,222 --> 00:41:34,019
I just pIay.
- What do you pIay?

373
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:38,423
FootbaII, or hockey?
- AII he pIays is fIush

374
00:41:40,464 --> 00:41:43,433
So you gambIe?
- Don't trust my father

375
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:45,034
He's aIways after me

376
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:50,040
There... My other son
Is here too

377
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:55,045
My other son.
- This one?

378
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:56,679
The eIder

379
00:41:57,081 --> 00:41:58,446
Where have you been?

380
00:41:59,883 --> 00:42:03,046
Hey, I'm asking you

381
00:42:03,253 --> 00:42:05,721
Where have you been?

382
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:08,217
Around. Why?

383
00:42:09,093 --> 00:42:12,460
Because the dirt on your shoes
TeIIs a different story

384
00:42:14,898 --> 00:42:16,058
Did you go out to the rann?

385
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:21,060
I have to. The cattIe stray.
I have to bring them back

386
00:42:21,271 --> 00:42:26,072
And why do they? For grazing on saIt?
Or for a taste of saIt water

387
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:31,070
Had they known as much,
WouId they be caIIed beasts?

388
00:42:31,482 --> 00:42:35,077
WeII said. You have a way with words

389
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,088
And you aren't as simpIe
As you make out to be

390
00:42:39,123 --> 00:42:41,489
From now on, we'II have to keep
Take good care of you

391
00:42:42,126 --> 00:42:46,085
Just as weII, sahib. TiII now,
My father was taking care of me

392
00:42:46,296 --> 00:42:47,729
Now, you too?

393
00:42:53,137 --> 00:42:55,503
Don't you worry

394
00:42:56,140 --> 00:43:00,099
I'II take better care of you
Than your father ever did

395
00:43:38,182 --> 00:43:39,649
We have come to take you

396
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:40,611
What...?

397
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:44,548
What is your name?
- SaIma

398
00:43:44,688 --> 00:43:47,555
SaIma... That's a IoveIy name

399
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:50,160
You're aII aIone, aren't you?

400
00:43:50,594 --> 00:43:54,553
I know you have no one.
Poor things, they've aII been kiIIed

401
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:59,158
Anyway, from now on,
You'II never be IoneIy

402
00:43:59,369 --> 00:44:02,566
You'II Iive with me

403
00:44:03,407 --> 00:44:06,171
For god's sake, don't say that!
- FooIish girI!

404
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:11,579
What I'm saying is for your good.
Food, cIothes, a home

405
00:44:11,715 --> 00:44:16,175
You need someone to provide you
With aII the needs of Iife

406
00:44:17,221 --> 00:44:21,590
Besides, I'm not that
Bad a man, saIma

407
00:44:22,226 --> 00:44:24,592
Look at me.
- Let go!

408
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:27,595
Why are you moIesting her?!
- Get out, oId man!

409
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,607
You Iike that girI?
- UndoubtedIy

410
00:44:40,244 --> 00:44:42,212
WiII you marry her?
- What?

411
00:44:42,412 --> 00:44:45,609
I asked you, wiII you marry her?
- I haven't thought about that

412
00:44:45,749 --> 00:44:48,616
Then forget about what
You've been thinking

413
00:44:50,254 --> 00:44:53,223
SaIma is someone's daughter too,
And someone's sister

414
00:44:53,423 --> 00:44:55,220
Her dignity isn't for saIe. Get it?

415
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:58,628
I understand, sir.
- Then go back to your duty

416
00:44:58,762 --> 00:45:01,629
You are going to bring us to shame!

417
00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:07,635
I beg your pardon for what
My soIdier has done

418
00:45:14,278 --> 00:45:19,648
My chiId, do not think you're aIone.
We won't Iet anything happen to you

419
00:45:20,784 --> 00:45:26,245
For me, you are just Iike
My daughter naaz

420
00:45:29,493 --> 00:45:34,658
So nice of the pakistani officer
To heIp someone in need

421
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,268
May the Iord preserve him

422
00:45:39,303 --> 00:45:44,263
AIso the refugee. To those who have
Lost their way, he hoIds the Iight

423
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:37,725
''Why do I feeI''

424
00:46:38,362 --> 00:46:41,729
''That which has never happened''

425
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:44,732
''WiII come to be''

426
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:48,735
''Why do I feeI''

427
00:46:49,773 --> 00:46:52,333
''This heart of mine''

428
00:46:53,377 --> 00:46:55,345
''I'm about to Iose''

429
00:46:55,746 --> 00:46:57,338
''Why eIse...''

430
00:46:57,781 --> 00:47:00,341
''Does the heart
Skip a beat?''

431
00:47:00,884 --> 00:47:04,752
''Why breathIessness?''

432
00:47:04,888 --> 00:47:08,756
''Why can I not sIeep?''

433
00:48:40,484 --> 00:48:46,855
''Why does someone's face
CIoud my eyes?''

434
00:48:47,991 --> 00:48:53,452
''Why comes onIy this one
In my dreams?''

435
00:48:54,031 --> 00:48:59,867
''With the new season
Is there new hope?''

436
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:03,867
''Why is there music in the air?''

437
00:49:11,515 --> 00:49:13,483
''Why do I feeI''

438
00:49:14,017 --> 00:49:18,886
''The beginning of an ecstasy''

439
00:49:21,525 --> 00:49:24,494
''Why do I feeI''

440
00:49:24,828 --> 00:49:29,891
''I am beginning to Iose myseIf''

441
00:49:31,068 --> 00:49:32,899
''Why eIse...''

442
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:35,903
''Does the heart
Skip a beat?''

443
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:38,906
''Why breathIessness?''

444
00:49:39,876 --> 00:49:43,903
''Why can I not sIeep?''

00:49:45,549 --> 00:49:47,517
''Why do I feeI''

446

''That which has never happened
WiII come to be''

447
00:50:22,919 --> 00:50:29,449
''Is this the fragrance I yearn for?''

448
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:35,857
''In the shade of the cIouds
Is there the coIour bIue?''

449
00:50:36,266 --> 00:50:42,068
''In the cooI breeze...
Is there a new song?''

450
00:50:42,606 --> 00:50:48,067
''Do I hear fIutes pIaying?''

451
00:51:02,626 --> 00:51:05,094
''Why do I feeI''

WiII come to end''

455
00:51:23,346 --> 00:51:24,904
''Why eIse...''

456
00:51:25,148 --> 00:51:27,514
''Does the heart
Skip a beat?''

457
00:51:28,485 --> 00:51:30,510
''Why breathIessness?''

458
00:51:31,321 --> 00:51:35,519
''Why can I not sIeep?''

459
00:51:51,174 --> 00:51:53,142
Is it reaIIy you?
Or am I dreaming?

460
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:54,574
Touch me, and see

461
00:51:58,181 --> 00:52:01,548
It's you! Dreams don't
FeeI the pinch

462
00:52:02,185 --> 00:52:04,551
TeII me, when did you Ieave,
And when did you get back?

463
00:52:04,688 --> 00:52:07,555
And what remains of the distance?
- If you want...

464
00:52:07,691 --> 00:52:09,158
There wiII be no distance

465
00:52:12,862 --> 00:52:14,693
This journey through Iife is strange

466
00:52:14,864 --> 00:52:16,559
One even begins to Iike
His merchandise

467
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:17,564
What...?

468
00:52:18,435 --> 00:52:21,165
Abbu... Ammi...
Look who's here

469
00:52:23,206 --> 00:52:25,572
When did you come?
- As and when you saw me

470
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:30,578
BIess you. What brings you here?
Important work?

471
00:52:32,215 --> 00:52:36,584
Work, yes. And I aIso wanted
To meet you. So I came over

472
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,187
Good you did

473
00:52:38,388 --> 00:52:41,585
He must be tired. How about
Some breakfast and tea?

474
00:52:41,725 --> 00:52:43,192
I'II make tea

475
00:52:44,227 --> 00:52:49,187
There's a confectioner nearby.
He makes a nice cookie with dates

476
00:52:49,399 --> 00:52:52,197
With tea, it's fabuIous.
I'II get it

477
00:52:52,736 --> 00:52:56,604
Cookie with dates?
I never ate that

478
00:52:57,407 --> 00:53:00,604
You can come aIong too
... I mean, we aII couId

479
00:53:01,244 --> 00:53:03,610
Never mind, I'II get it.
- I'II come too

480
00:53:03,747 --> 00:53:06,614
Abbu, may I?
- AII right. But be back soon

481
00:53:14,658 --> 00:53:16,626
Did you say something?
- No

482
00:53:16,926 --> 00:53:20,225
Then what was that I heard?
- It happens

483
00:53:20,463 --> 00:53:23,626
What happens?
- Your ears are ringing

484
00:53:23,767 --> 00:53:26,634
Are there beIIs in my ears
That start ringing?

485
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:29,636
Then there must be something
That you want to hear

486
00:53:30,273 --> 00:53:32,241
Something I missed saying.

487
00:53:35,779 --> 00:53:37,644
What happened? Come aIong

488
00:53:42,285 --> 00:53:47,655
TeII me, how come you're back
So soon? With more refugees?

489
00:53:48,291 --> 00:53:51,260
With just myseIf.
- Lies

490
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,667
Is the fIour done?
- It'II take some time

491
00:54:08,812 --> 00:54:12,680
What I'm asking you is,
Do you get sIeep at nights?

492
00:54:14,317 --> 00:54:18,686
Do you get sIeep at nights?
- PerfectIy. Like a chiId

493
00:54:19,322 --> 00:54:22,291
ChiIdren wake up in their sIeep,
And they cry

494
00:54:23,827 --> 00:54:27,695
Kids wake up, and they cry

495
00:54:27,997 --> 00:54:31,694
Nothing of the sort happens to me.
I enjoy my sIeep

496
00:54:32,335 --> 00:54:33,302
You're Iying!

497
00:54:34,337 --> 00:54:38,706
TeII me, does your heart
Yearn for someone?

498
00:54:39,342 --> 00:54:43,301
What?
- Do you yearn for someone?

499
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,706
Leavened bread? Fried in butter?
Great!

500
00:54:47,851 --> 00:54:53,721
Stop joking. TeII me, at heart,
Do you yearn for someone?

501
00:54:53,857 --> 00:54:54,824
No

502
00:54:56,359 --> 00:54:57,724
You're Iying

503
00:54:58,361 --> 00:55:02,320
If everything is aII Iies,
Then what's the truth?

504
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:08,735
I didn't say anything

505
00:55:16,379 --> 00:55:18,347
Back?

506
00:55:36,399 --> 00:55:37,764
What's written in it?

507
00:55:43,406 --> 00:55:45,772
The same oId romantic story

508
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:49,378
About Iovers separated

509
00:55:50,413 --> 00:55:53,382
In the end, they die for each other

510
00:55:54,083 --> 00:55:58,383
But our refugee isn't about
To give his Iife for a girI

511
00:55:58,922 --> 00:56:01,789
He's just going to do what we ask him,
No questions asked

512
00:56:02,425 --> 00:56:06,794
Come over tomorrow morning. There's
A bundIe of cIothes to be deIivered

513
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:10,797
On your way back, bring the guns.
- Guns for whom?

514
00:56:10,934 --> 00:56:18,807
The Iesser you ask, the safer
Your Iady Iove wiII be. EIse...

515
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:21,738
EIse what, you pimp?

516
00:56:22,445 --> 00:56:26,404
If she is even touched,
I'II rip you apart!

517
00:56:29,452 --> 00:56:34,822
How many wiII you rip apart?
Me, the border guards...

518
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:38,427
AIso the pakistani rangers
Across the border?

519
00:56:39,696 --> 00:56:43,826
Rip it up. Rip it aII apart

520
00:56:49,973 --> 00:56:53,841
Strange are your ways, Iord

521
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:59,846
Son, I see something new in you

522
00:57:00,817 --> 00:57:06,449
But I aIways come here
To beg for bIessings

523
00:57:10,493 --> 00:57:13,860
What is it you seek
That you have not?

524
00:57:15,498 --> 00:57:21,869
I have no one. No father, no mother,
No friend, no brother

525
00:57:22,505 --> 00:57:24,132
Not even a country

526
00:57:24,674 --> 00:57:32,479
Thou art my father, thou art my mother
Thou art my brother, thou, my friend

527
00:57:33,516 --> 00:57:36,883
For whom are you praying?

528
00:57:40,523 --> 00:57:42,150
There is someone

529
00:57:46,529 --> 00:57:48,497
Across the border

530
00:57:54,537 --> 00:57:58,906
The same officer! AIIah heIp us!

531
00:57:59,042 --> 00:58:00,907
Don't worry. He isn't a bad man

532
00:58:09,552 --> 00:58:10,519
PIease be seated

533
00:58:13,056 --> 00:58:15,923
Good to see that you've taken up
A house here

534
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:23,931
We want to get over what we came here
For. It might take us time

535
00:58:24,067 --> 00:58:27,935
So we took a house.
- Yes, a match for your daughter

536
00:58:28,571 --> 00:58:32,940
You wiII have to hunt far and wide.
- Without the Iord's wish...

537
00:58:33,076 --> 00:58:37,945
Man can do nothing, sahib.
- True. Look at me

538
00:58:38,581 --> 00:58:42,950
FoIks at home have tried their best.
But here I am... AII aIone

539
00:58:43,786 --> 00:58:47,950
You aren't married yet?
- No

540
00:58:48,391 --> 00:58:52,555
Why?
- Forever, I've been Iooking...

541
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:58,231
For the Iooks
I might faII for

542
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:07,976
Abba, Iook! Pretty IittIe kids!
Look at them!

543
00:59:08,111 --> 00:59:11,979
Where did you pick them up?
- Aren't they pretty, amma?

544
00:59:19,622 --> 00:59:21,988
Aren't they pretty, abba?
- Yes dear

545
00:59:24,427 --> 00:59:26,588
Say saIaam to the gentIeman

546
00:59:26,796 --> 00:59:27,922
Go inside

547
00:59:29,799 --> 00:59:32,996
Strange, haven't you found
Anyone, ever?

548
00:59:33,536 --> 00:59:36,266
Yes, and no

549
00:59:38,641 --> 00:59:39,938
Meaning?

550
00:59:41,144 --> 00:59:47,014
Without the Iord's wish,
Man can do nothing.

551
00:59:57,293 --> 00:59:59,022
Pretty kids, reaIIy

552
01:00:00,329 --> 01:00:03,298
But not prettier than you are

553
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:16,035
What is the matter?

554
01:00:16,179 --> 01:00:17,976
Someone is here to see you

555
01:00:22,218 --> 01:00:27,815
Has he a name?
- Why not? The name is refugee

556
01:00:28,324 --> 01:00:29,313
What?

557
01:00:32,328 --> 01:00:33,795
Is that any name?

558
01:00:52,715 --> 01:00:54,080
What's wrong with my name?

559
01:00:54,717 --> 01:00:59,086
One who comes seeking refuge
Is caIIed a refugee

560
01:00:59,722 --> 01:01:03,681
That's why I don't Iike that name.
I want someone to give me refuge

561
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:05,691
Not someone who wants refuge

562
01:01:06,195 --> 01:01:10,689
I don't understand.
- Don't stress your IittIe mind

563
01:01:11,067 --> 01:01:14,696
Suffice to know that I wiII never
CaII you by that name

564
01:01:14,871 --> 01:01:17,704
Then what wiII you caII me?

565
01:01:22,245 --> 01:01:24,713
Yes, just jee

566
01:01:29,252 --> 01:01:32,119
But that's what girIs caII
Their husbands

567
01:01:38,761 --> 01:01:43,130
Take it as you Iike.
But what I want to say is...

568
01:01:43,766 --> 01:01:47,725
You aren't giving aII that
You earn to your father

569
01:01:47,937 --> 01:01:49,734
You'II Iet me have some too.
- Why?

570
01:01:49,939 --> 01:01:52,134
I have to buiId this house.
- You want to buiId this house?

571
01:01:52,775 --> 01:01:55,744
For yourseIf?
- Not for myseIf. For us

572
01:02:05,288 --> 01:02:10,157
Naaz, do you reaIise
What you are saying?

573
01:02:10,793 --> 01:02:15,162
Why not? I'm taIking about tomorrow.
My house... Is yours

574
01:02:15,798 --> 01:02:16,765
My house?

575
01:02:19,802 --> 01:02:20,769
Mine...?

576
01:02:35,318 --> 01:02:41,188
Can someone beIieve it when he sees
His cherished dream coming true?

577
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:48,187
My house, my viIIage, my country

578
01:02:49,332 --> 01:02:51,800
Are you about to weep?

579
01:02:52,235 --> 01:02:56,194
No, the joy wiII fIow forth
From my eyes

580
01:02:58,341 --> 01:03:02,209
Naaz, whether or not
My country I have...

581
01:03:03,346 --> 01:03:05,211
Whether my viIIage
I have or not...

582
01:03:05,848 --> 01:03:10,217
Whether my name is mine,
But this dream wiII remain mine

583
01:03:11,854 --> 01:03:13,822
The dream you have given to me

584
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:24,232
Whether or not we buiId this house,
I shaII aIways be gratefuI to you

585
01:03:25,868 --> 01:03:28,837
For caring for my dream

586
01:03:29,372 --> 01:03:32,239
Why can't we buiId the house?
Just make enough money

587
01:03:33,876 --> 01:03:37,243
The money, I can give you.
But what about your father?

588
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:39,347
What wiII he say?

589
01:03:40,883 --> 01:03:43,249
Yes, that's worrying

590
01:03:44,553 --> 01:03:49,252
There's a way out. Give the money
To your uncIe aItaf mohammad

591
01:03:49,892 --> 01:03:51,860
He wiII give the money to abba,
And he wiII give it to me

592
01:03:52,061 --> 01:03:55,258
That couId work.
- Done?

593
01:03:55,398 --> 01:03:58,265
Done.
- Then your house is as good as done

594
01:03:58,401 --> 01:04:01,268
Done aIready?
- Yes. I can see it

595
01:04:01,404 --> 01:04:02,371
Where?

596
01:04:02,571 --> 01:04:05,870
Look into my eyes, into my heart.
You'II see it

597
01:04:09,712 --> 01:04:11,270
You need some money?

598
01:04:11,914 --> 01:04:15,281
Yes.
- What?! Do you hear?

599
01:04:15,418 --> 01:04:17,283
For the first time ever,
My son wants money!

600
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,888
Keep it! Keep it aII!

601
01:04:20,256 --> 01:04:24,886
What do you want aII this money for?
- To buy a gift for someone

602
01:04:26,929 --> 01:04:29,898
Look at me... Look!

603
01:04:30,933 --> 01:04:32,901
If something transpires,
You'II teII me, won't you?

604
01:04:33,436 --> 01:04:37,304
If not you, who eIse wiII I teII?
- God bIess you, my chiId!

605
01:04:38,441 --> 01:04:41,308
Stop staring, count the money
And serve Iunch for my son

606
01:04:41,444 --> 01:04:43,309
The food is ready

607
01:04:43,946 --> 01:04:46,312
No hurry. I'II eat Iater

608
01:04:46,449 --> 01:04:47,416
Listen...

609
01:04:47,950 --> 01:04:49,315
Son, I'm gIad!

610
01:06:14,036 --> 01:06:18,405
''Now our hearts
Beat together''

611
01:06:25,047 --> 01:06:27,413
''We are crazy...''

612
01:06:30,052 --> 01:06:33,419
''So goes the story''

613
01:08:09,785 --> 01:08:15,519
''Your scorching eyes
Bring out my beauty''

614
01:08:18,661 --> 01:08:23,530
''Ever since I feII in Iove
I have been a compIete woman''

615
01:08:36,845 --> 01:08:42,545
''This is the truth
It's aII your doing''

616
01:08:43,185 --> 01:08:47,554
''I have Iost aII my senses
Oh, I am now mad''

617
01:09:23,225 --> 01:09:24,920
Whom are these guns meant for?

618
01:09:28,731 --> 01:09:35,603
It's said of Iove that
The hunter becomes the hunted

619
01:09:37,239 --> 01:09:39,207
The whims of the rich, my friend.

620
01:09:39,408 --> 01:09:41,603
That thakur mahendra pratap singh
Over on the other side

621
01:09:41,744 --> 01:09:43,609
It's the stuff he wants
To go hunting with

622
01:09:43,746 --> 01:09:45,213
CarefuI whiIe you go

623
01:10:01,263 --> 01:10:02,628
Hey brother...

624
01:10:03,899 --> 01:10:05,628
Give me the money.
I need it

625
01:10:06,268 --> 01:10:10,227
I need the money I have

626
01:10:10,506 --> 01:10:13,634
What wiII you do with money?
- Do I have no needs?

627
01:10:14,243 --> 01:10:18,646
I have to make a Iiving.
I have to make my dreams come true

628
01:10:19,281 --> 01:10:24,412
A home, a wife.
Kids

629
01:10:26,288 --> 01:10:28,256
LoveIy dream

630
01:10:28,624 --> 01:10:34,256
But teII me, what wiII you
Name my nephew?

631
01:10:34,463 --> 01:10:36,431
SaIim refugee,
Or aIi refugee?

632
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:39,927
What nonsense! My chiIdren aren't
Going to be refugees!

633
01:10:40,302 --> 01:10:44,261
You don't have a name to yourseIf.
What name wiII you give your chiIdren?

634
01:10:44,606 --> 01:10:47,268
You know what they caII someone
Who doesn't have a father?

635
01:10:55,317 --> 01:10:58,286
The news?
- At dawn, the day after tomorrow...

636
01:10:58,821 --> 01:11:01,688
One man wiII cross over.
- Name?

637
01:11:02,324 --> 01:11:04,690
No name.
- What do you mean?

638
01:11:05,327 --> 01:11:08,694
If you are smart,
You'II know who he is

639
01:11:26,849 --> 01:11:28,714
What's the bad news this time?

640
01:11:30,853 --> 01:11:33,720
Today, it's good news

641
01:11:34,356 --> 01:11:37,325
You can't go to india tonight
- Why?

642
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:40,726
The border guards are
On the Iookout for you

643
01:11:41,163 --> 01:11:43,324
Who informed them?
- I got to know that...

644
01:11:43,532 --> 01:11:45,727
Someone cIose to you
Has tattIed

645
01:11:50,873 --> 01:11:55,674
Thanks. But I must go.
- Fine. It's your Iife

646
01:12:06,388 --> 01:12:08,754
TeII me, why are you dressed
In whites?

647
01:12:09,057 --> 01:12:11,753
The coIour white doesn't show up
In the rann

648
01:12:11,894 --> 01:12:13,759
I'II merge with the background white
In the rann

649
01:12:14,396 --> 01:12:16,762
But you must go?
- I have to

650
01:12:17,299 --> 01:12:19,028
I toId you not to!

651
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:31,777
You shouId've been named
The angry one

652
01:12:38,921 --> 01:12:41,389
Naaz, my good naaz

653
01:12:43,926 --> 01:12:49,057
I'm not good. I'm bad! Very bad!
But I'm not Ietting you go

654
01:12:49,665 --> 01:12:53,795
To whom beIongs my whoIe Iife?
TeII me

655
01:12:53,936 --> 01:12:57,394
How wouId I know?
- You know. It's yours

656
01:12:57,606 --> 01:13:02,805
Isn't it... Isn't it?
- Yes. It is. So?

657
01:13:02,945 --> 01:13:05,812
I'm just going away
For just a few days

658
01:13:06,448 --> 01:13:08,416
Not for one moment

659
01:13:09,785 --> 01:13:11,810
When you get angry...

660
01:13:13,455 --> 01:13:17,915
You Iook IoveIy!
- Not otherwise? I won't taIk to you!

661
01:13:19,795 --> 01:13:23,856
Angry again? Stop getting worked up.
- On one condition

662
01:13:24,466 --> 01:13:27,435
You wiII say whatever I say.
- Agreed

663
01:13:27,970 --> 01:13:32,839
When you waIk, when you sit...
- When you waIk, when you sit...

664
01:13:32,975 --> 01:13:35,443
When you sIeep, when you're awake...
- When you sIeep, when you're awake...

665
01:13:35,978 --> 01:13:38,845
When you Iaugh, when you cry...
- When you Iaugh, when you cry...

666
01:13:38,981 --> 01:13:42,849
When you fight...
- And when you fight, I Iove you

667
01:13:43,952 --> 01:13:46,853
I didn't say that. Why did you say it?
- I didn't say it either

668
01:13:47,489 --> 01:13:50,856
Then who eIse said that?
- This fooI said it

669
01:13:51,493 --> 01:13:53,859
SoftIy, beat that heart.
- Why?

670
01:13:55,497 --> 01:13:57,465
I Iive in there

671
01:13:58,901 --> 01:14:01,870
Listen to me, don't go today

672
01:14:04,506 --> 01:14:06,474
Today I have to go, naaz

673
01:14:08,010 --> 01:14:10,478
Do you Iike going away from me?

674
01:14:24,526 --> 01:14:26,892
Anything in sight?
- No sir

675
01:14:29,531 --> 01:14:30,896
You wiII

676
01:14:34,269 --> 01:14:35,167
I see something!

677
01:14:47,950 --> 01:14:49,508
Let him come cIoser

678
01:17:10,892 --> 01:17:13,326
Has the very earth devoured him?

679
01:17:13,695 --> 01:17:15,663
Whoever he is, he's very smart

680
01:17:17,199 --> 01:17:19,064
He knows the rann inside out

681
01:17:20,202 --> 01:17:21,669
Turn back

682
01:18:49,291 --> 01:18:52,260
Get up! What happened?

683
01:18:52,794 --> 01:18:56,662
Shot me.
- Shot you? Who'd shoot you?

684
01:18:56,798 --> 01:19:00,256
The border guards. They're scouring
The viIIage Iooking for me

685
01:19:00,435 --> 01:19:04,667
Don't worry. I'II extract the buIIet,
And I'II wash the wound with herbs

686
01:19:05,307 --> 01:19:08,276
The wound wiII heaI soon.
TiII then, you stay here

687
01:19:20,322 --> 01:19:24,281
What are you doing?
- Making a home

688
01:19:24,626 --> 01:19:27,288
For whom?
- MyseIf. Who eIse?

689
01:19:28,830 --> 01:19:30,297
Is this supposed to be your job?

690
01:19:33,335 --> 01:19:35,701
If the home is mine,
Why isn't the work mine?

691
01:19:36,338 --> 01:19:40,707
I watch the birds making nests
Out of twigs

692
01:19:41,343 --> 01:19:43,971
Then they hunt for food
To feed their young

693
01:19:44,713 --> 01:19:48,308
And whom wiII you feed?
- No one

694
01:19:48,483 --> 01:19:50,713
But someone wiII feed me.
- Who?

695
01:19:51,353 --> 01:19:55,312
There must be someone,
The angeIs have chosen for me

696
01:19:55,857 --> 01:19:59,315
So you've decided to marry?

697
01:20:01,529 --> 01:20:05,727
I have to. How Iong wiII I remain
A burden on my father?

698
01:20:06,368 --> 01:20:10,327
If I find a good man Iike you,
I'II take his hand

699
01:20:13,708 --> 01:20:15,005
Amen

700
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:20,746
What worries me now,
Is naaz's marriage

701
01:20:27,789 --> 01:20:30,758
Here you are, and I was Iooking over
The whoIe house for you

702
01:20:31,393 --> 01:20:33,759
Be seated.
- Thank you

703
01:20:34,896 --> 01:20:36,363
Is everything aII right?

704
01:20:36,932 --> 01:20:42,768
Thanks be to the Iord, sahib.
- If you caII me ''sahib''...

705
01:20:43,405 --> 01:20:49,366
I won't Iike it. I want to know
Something about naaz's marriage

706
01:20:49,711 --> 01:20:53,772
Are you Iooking for
A reputed famiIy?

707
01:20:55,917 --> 01:21:03,380
We haven't quite thought about that.
- No, I mean... What if...

708
01:21:03,591 --> 01:21:08,392
The bridegroom's entourage is Iarge?
- You speak as if you've found...

709
01:21:08,596 --> 01:21:13,397
A boy for our naaz.
- How couId I...?

710
01:21:14,436 --> 01:21:21,399
She has found someone for herseIf
- Who is he?

711
01:21:22,844 --> 01:21:24,812
You shouId ask your daughter

712
01:21:25,447 --> 01:21:32,819
Naaz is very shy. She won't teII us
Anything. Why don't you teII us?

713
01:21:34,456 --> 01:21:41,828
A girI won't speak of it openIy.
But conversationaIIy...

714
01:21:41,963 --> 01:21:48,835
She toId me, ''if I find a good man
Like you, I'II take his hand''

715
01:21:50,472 --> 01:21:56,433
You won't object, wiII you?
- You speak of objections?!

716
01:21:56,978 --> 01:22:03,440
We cannot beIieve our good fortune!
- Do I take it as a yes from you?

717
01:22:03,985 --> 01:22:05,850
OnIy a very Iucky girI
WouId find such man!

718
01:22:08,990 --> 01:22:12,448
Then I'II speak to my mother.
Goodbye

719
01:22:15,296 --> 01:22:16,456
God bIess you, son

720
01:22:19,901 --> 01:22:21,459
Lady!

721
01:22:21,669 --> 01:22:23,864
SaIaam aIeikum, Iady!
Is everything aII right?

722
01:22:24,506 --> 01:22:25,871
Bad mood?

723
01:22:33,748 --> 01:22:35,477
SaIaam uncIe.
- BIess you

724
01:22:36,518 --> 01:22:38,486
Have you come aIone?
- Yes

725
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:43,883
Anything important?
- Your nephew...

726
01:22:44,025 --> 01:22:46,892
Hasn't been here for quite some time.
- Yes, it's been a whiIe

727
01:22:48,029 --> 01:22:51,897
Is he aII right?
I'm very scared

728
01:22:53,034 --> 01:22:56,902
I've been seeing a very bad dream
About him having been shot

729
01:22:58,239 --> 01:23:00,036
Your dream wasn't untrue

730
01:23:00,708 --> 01:23:02,903
Yes, he was shot

731
01:23:03,545 --> 01:23:04,512
No!

732
01:23:07,949 --> 01:23:12,511
Naaz! Stop, my chiId

733
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:20,528
Get a hoId on yourseIf

734
01:23:20,895 --> 01:23:22,522
It's a minor wound

735
01:23:22,897 --> 01:23:25,923
He's aII right...
He's aII right, dear

736
01:23:30,905 --> 01:23:35,933
Are you saying the truth?
- WouId I Iie to you, my chiId?

737
01:23:37,078 --> 01:23:41,947
Then swear it.
- I swear it by aIIah

738
01:23:43,084 --> 01:23:45,951
He's aII right now.
He'II be here soon

739
01:23:48,089 --> 01:23:50,956
And I shouIdn't worry?
- Yes, my chiId

740
01:23:51,893 --> 01:23:56,956
Have faith in the Iord.
He aIways Iistens to ardent prayers

741
01:24:03,104 --> 01:24:04,071
AIIah!

742
01:24:11,112 --> 01:24:13,979
Lord, thou art Iove

743
01:24:14,115 --> 01:24:17,983
With faith in thy Iove and mercy,
I am going to marry the man I Iove

744
01:24:18,119 --> 01:24:19,984
So heIp me Iord

745
01:24:34,636 --> 01:24:39,005
I was praying to the Iord
That he sends you to me

746
01:24:39,641 --> 01:24:43,008
I open my eyes, and I see you

747
01:24:43,311 --> 01:24:49,011
A miIIion thanks to aIIah!
My prayers have been answered

748
01:24:49,150 --> 01:24:52,950
Your uncIe said that you had been
Shot. It hurt you, didn't it?

749
01:24:54,189 --> 01:24:56,282
Just a minor wound.
It heaIed

750
01:24:56,658 --> 01:25:00,025
Minor wound? Was it a buIIet
Or a cotton peIIet?

751
01:25:00,161 --> 01:25:03,028
You're Iying. Show it to me.
I want to see

752
01:25:03,431 --> 01:25:07,026
What madness is this? I toId you.
The wound has heaIed

753
01:25:10,672 --> 01:25:14,631
Had it been a wound you were to
InfIict on me, it wouId never heaI

754
01:25:15,009 --> 01:25:19,036
Just a buIIet. It's heaIed.
- Don't you fIatter me

755
01:25:19,180 --> 01:25:23,048
Now Iisten, I'm not Ietting you go
Anywhere. I have found out...

756
01:25:23,685 --> 01:25:26,654
Where the priest Iives. I'II beg him
To get us married today itseIf

757
01:25:26,854 --> 01:25:29,049
Today itseIf? Is this a doII's wedding?

758
01:25:29,357 --> 01:25:31,655
Joke as much as you Iike,
But you're staying here.

759
01:25:33,027 --> 01:25:36,656
WiII these peopIe Iet me Iive here?
- Then we'II cross back

760
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,195
WiII they Iet you Iive over there?

761
01:25:41,369 --> 01:25:44,065
Neither here, nor there?
Then where do we Iive?

762
01:25:45,206 --> 01:25:49,074
In our hearts, where onIy we ruIe

763
01:25:50,044 --> 01:25:53,673
Before you ruIe, you must seek
The bIessings of my parents

764
01:25:56,284 --> 01:26:02,348
Ammi, your dream is about to come true.
Keep the bride's trousseau ready

765
01:26:03,658 --> 01:26:07,094
Naaz, don't make such a hasty decision
About your Iife!

766
01:26:07,228 --> 01:26:11,494
Who am I? What's my standing?
Think about my precedents, naaz

767
01:26:12,033 --> 01:26:15,696
Their forefathers might be from bihar.
As of now, they are in our country

768
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:20,867
How are you? You've come
After a Iong time

769
01:26:21,142 --> 01:26:23,110
Yes ammi. She is a musIim

770
01:26:23,344 --> 01:26:25,710
Abbu, I want to discuss
Something with you

771
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:32,713
The decision concerns my Iife
- I've come to know of your decision

772
01:26:33,755 --> 01:26:39,716
I'm gIad! You made yourseIf a home,
And you even took your own decisions!

773
01:26:40,094 --> 01:26:45,122
May the Iord give you much happiness.
- I've been praying for the same

774
01:26:45,266 --> 01:26:48,133
May the Iord make your every wish
Come true

775
01:26:48,603 --> 01:26:50,730
Yes, I Iike her very much

776
01:26:51,072 --> 01:26:56,135
The Iord has given me my wish.
And you've given me happiness

777
01:26:56,277 --> 01:26:58,142
I am not afraid of anyone
In this worId!

778
01:27:03,184 --> 01:27:05,152
Naaz, Iook at me...

779
01:27:06,287 --> 01:27:07,754
What's wrong with you?

780
01:27:07,955 --> 01:27:11,152
Your eyes... Hey, you're cross-eyed!

781
01:27:11,793 --> 01:27:14,159
And your nose... It's crooked!

782
01:27:14,295 --> 01:27:17,162
It'II take either a bIind man
Or a madman to marry you

783
01:27:17,799 --> 01:27:20,768
What did you say?
Just you wait!

784
01:27:21,369 --> 01:27:27,171
The night after tomorrow,
Just take a Iook at the moon

785
01:27:27,308 --> 01:27:29,674
It's a fuII-moon night.
You'II see how beautifuI she is

786
01:27:38,434 --> 01:27:40,299
Stop! Stop, I say

787
01:27:49,945 --> 01:27:52,914
Cross-eyed, am I?
- No! Your eyes are very pretty

788
01:27:53,949 --> 01:27:56,315
Crooked nose?
- No, it's straight

789
01:27:56,618 --> 01:27:59,917
And no one wiII marry me?
- Anyone wouId!

790
01:28:00,489 --> 01:28:02,320
I'II show you!

791
01:28:03,959 --> 01:28:06,325
Hey, you've made a home!
- Shut your eyes!

792
01:28:06,462 --> 01:28:09,920
You've seen nothing!
Go on, out of here

793
01:28:10,966 --> 01:28:12,934
Don't come in tiII I caII you

794
01:28:26,148 --> 01:28:27,615
Dressed Iike a bride!

795
01:28:27,983 --> 01:28:29,348
Your wedding dress?

796
01:28:30,486 --> 01:28:32,613
One for you too.
Put it on

797
01:28:34,990 --> 01:28:39,359
But why? What's going on?
- I toId you. Just wear it

798
01:28:47,002 --> 01:28:49,971
What have you made me wear?
- You Iook nice

799
01:28:51,006 --> 01:28:53,372
How do you Iike the house?
- You've decorated it...

800
01:28:53,509 --> 01:28:56,967
just Iike my father's house.
- So that when you Iive here...

801
01:28:57,179 --> 01:29:00,376
you won't miss India

802
01:29:08,524 --> 01:29:11,982
What are you thinking?
- As my Iost dream...

803
01:29:12,194 --> 01:29:15,994
is right here in front of me.
- Do I figure somewhere in the dream?

804
01:29:17,032 --> 01:29:18,499
You are the dream

805
01:29:24,039 --> 01:29:28,408
It's Iate. If I don't Ieave now,
I won't be abIe to make it by daybreak

806
01:30:44,620 --> 01:30:48,488
''O'feIIow traveIIer''

807
01:30:49,458 --> 01:30:54,088
''Come cIose to me''

808
01:31:09,878 --> 01:31:14,110
''For a Iifetime, we have to
traveI together''

809
01:31:14,650 --> 01:31:18,518
''Come cIose to me''

810
01:32:31,226 --> 01:32:35,595
''On this journey together''

811
01:32:35,897 --> 01:32:39,594
''Together in darkness''

812
01:33:00,756 --> 01:33:04,624
''We mustn't Iose these moments''

813
01:33:05,260 --> 01:33:09,629
''Come cIose to me''

814
01:34:58,774 --> 01:35:03,734
''Those who have Ieft
their homes behind''

815
01:35:04,546 --> 01:35:08,744
''WiII never be afraid
of distances''

816
01:35:24,399 --> 01:35:28,358
''We wiII traveI
to the Iand of Iove''

817
01:35:28,703 --> 01:35:33,367
''Come cIose to me''

818
01:36:21,289 --> 01:36:23,484
Why isn't Refugee here with them yet?

819
01:36:23,792 --> 01:36:28,058
Strange! It's my son who isn't back.
Aren't you worrying too much?

820
01:36:28,396 --> 01:36:34,824
Your son has my bIessings. I'm worried
for those who are traveIIing with him

821
01:36:36,238 --> 01:36:39,833
You know them?
- You couId say so

822
01:36:40,475 --> 01:36:42,443
One of them is a bigshot

823
01:36:43,478 --> 01:36:44,945
Bigshot? Meaning?

824
01:36:46,281 --> 01:36:51,844
Big enough to run this entire business
we're part of

825
01:36:52,988 --> 01:36:56,856
If that's the bigshot,
then it's him coming

826
01:36:58,493 --> 01:37:00,120
Yes! He's the one

827
01:37:11,506 --> 01:37:13,474
WeIcome!

828
01:37:15,010 --> 01:37:17,478
I hope you didn't have probIems
on the way?

829
01:37:19,814 --> 01:37:21,475
Makkad?
- Yes

830
01:37:21,683 --> 01:37:23,150
I'm Jaan Mohammad

831
01:37:24,519 --> 01:37:25,884
I know

832
01:37:30,025 --> 01:37:34,485
You do...?
But we've never met before

833
01:37:39,734 --> 01:37:42,897
Come, Iet's sit on the roof
of my new house and taIk

834
01:37:54,716 --> 01:37:56,513
PIease be seated

835
01:37:57,052 --> 01:37:59,520
Who are these peopIe?
- I don't know

836
01:37:59,721 --> 01:38:01,518
But whoever they are,
they aren't right

837
01:38:01,957 --> 01:38:04,926
What do you mean?
- They aren't refugees

838
01:38:05,060 --> 01:38:07,927
They're something eIse.
On the way, they fought with me

839
01:38:08,063 --> 01:38:10,691
AIthough it was
their mistake.

840
01:38:35,590 --> 01:38:37,956
I was just trying to save your Iife

841
01:38:39,594 --> 01:38:43,553
A Iighted match can be seen
for miIes across the Rann

842
01:38:44,599 --> 01:38:47,966
Had anyone seen it, we wouId've
aII been dead

843
01:38:51,606 --> 01:38:54,575
Fought with you?
You aren't hurt, are you?

844
01:38:54,776 --> 01:38:59,975
Nothing much.
- One minute

845
01:39:03,018 --> 01:39:04,986
My son says you fought with him

846
01:39:06,621 --> 01:39:08,248
I'm asking you

847
01:39:12,127 --> 01:39:17,588
I spared him because he knew the way.
Otherwise, I shoot men Iike these

848
01:39:19,401 --> 01:39:20,993
You'II shoot me?
Shoot me!

849
01:39:21,136 --> 01:39:23,001
Who d'you think you're going to shoot?
Who d'you think you're trying to scare?

850
01:39:23,138 --> 01:39:24,935
Shoot!

851
01:39:25,807 --> 01:39:30,005
CaIm down, son! You mustn't do this.
Jaan Mohammad, sit down

852
01:39:30,145 --> 01:39:32,010
What's happened to my son?
- Here comes the Iady!

853
01:39:32,647 --> 01:39:35,616
This is Jaan Mohammad's wife.
This is his younger son

854
01:39:35,917 --> 01:39:39,011
PIease be seated, Iady.
...Don't get angry

855
01:39:39,654 --> 01:39:40,951
Be seated

856
01:39:42,157 --> 01:39:43,624
ReIax

857
01:39:43,825 --> 01:39:49,024
He's a very good boy. It's just the
fire of the youth. Forgive him

858
01:39:54,269 --> 01:39:56,134
When the trapped bird tries
to free itseIf...

859
01:39:57,672 --> 01:40:04,043
it breaks its own wings. Makes no
difference to the trap. Get it?

860
01:40:06,181 --> 01:40:12,643
I'm not here to fight.
I know everything has a price

861
01:40:13,188 --> 01:40:15,656
And I'm paying you the price

862
01:40:16,091 --> 01:40:17,149
Look here

863
01:40:19,694 --> 01:40:21,059
I don't want your money

864
01:40:23,031 --> 01:40:24,658
He has gone mad!
- So much money!

865
01:40:25,100 --> 01:40:30,060
Look Iady! Not even four generations
of yours wouId have seen so much!

866
01:40:31,172 --> 01:40:34,073
Keep it. The Goddess of WeaIth
has come home to you!

867
01:40:34,375 --> 01:40:35,672
Forget it, Abbu!

868
01:40:35,877 --> 01:40:39,677
Let's keep it.
- He's mad!

869
01:40:39,881 --> 01:40:42,679
AItercations happen aII the time.
Why shouId you mind?

870
01:40:42,884 --> 01:40:45,079
Go on, Iady. Take it aII away

871
01:40:47,722 --> 01:40:49,087
God bIess you, son

872
01:40:51,726 --> 01:40:56,686
Now teII us, what's the programme?
- They are taking the train to DeIhi

873
01:40:57,732 --> 01:41:00,098
They must board the train tonight.
- WiII be done

874
01:41:00,235 --> 01:41:03,102
My son is very tired.
He isn't going anywhere

875
01:41:04,739 --> 01:41:07,105
Go on son. Eat something.
And get some rest

876
01:41:09,744 --> 01:41:12,110
I'II see them off.
- Shut up! You aren't going anywhere

877
01:41:12,247 --> 01:41:15,114
I'm going, Abbu. Let me go
- Oh yes, he'II manage. Sharp kid

878
01:41:19,754 --> 01:41:21,221
So much money? What for?

879
01:41:22,257 --> 01:41:26,125
Buy the tickets. Keep the change

880
01:41:26,294 --> 01:41:31,732
Keep it?! There's 10,000 in this wad!
There wiII be Iots Ieft over

881
01:41:32,033 --> 01:41:35,127
There are a Iot more wads
from where this comes

882
01:41:35,770 --> 01:41:40,139
Keep working, take orders.
Wads Iike these wiII rain on you

883
01:41:43,444 --> 01:41:47,141
And you...?
- I'II Iive here. In this viIIage

884
01:41:48,116 --> 01:41:52,143
You can't stay here. The border guards
come here at aII odd times...

885
01:41:52,287 --> 01:41:55,154
to do head-counts.
And I'm the viIIage chief

886
01:41:55,290 --> 01:41:57,417
What's my repIy going to be,
if he counts one head more?

887
01:42:02,297 --> 01:42:08,167
Once you've stepped into deep waters,
it's no use getting scared of drowning

888
01:42:11,806 --> 01:42:15,173
Who is that man?
- He Iives in our viIIage

889
01:42:15,310 --> 01:42:17,175
What's his name?
- Haider

890
01:42:19,814 --> 01:42:21,782
Nice name.
- Sure

891
01:42:21,983 --> 01:42:23,780
CaII him up

892
01:42:25,820 --> 01:42:27,185
Come up

893
01:42:28,323 --> 01:42:30,188
Run, man!
- Coming

894
01:42:41,836 --> 01:42:44,805
Big brother here wants to meet you

895
01:42:45,006 --> 01:42:49,204
Greetings Haider AIi, greetings

896
01:43:03,658 --> 01:43:11,224
Now I've soIved your probIem.
Haider is stiII aIive

897
01:43:12,867 --> 01:43:14,835
Takes care of your head count

898
01:43:17,872 --> 01:43:22,172
From now on...
my name is Haider AIi

899
01:43:28,383 --> 01:43:30,248
Take care of the corpse.
- WiII be done

900
01:43:37,892 --> 01:43:39,257
Give me a hand, Shadab

901
01:43:49,404 --> 01:43:51,770
Who is it, so Iate at night?

902
01:43:54,909 --> 01:43:57,776
HeIIo Ammi! HeIIo Abbu!
- My son!

903
01:43:59,914 --> 01:44:01,779
Where the heII have you been?
- I had gone to DeIhi

904
01:44:02,417 --> 01:44:05,386
Hasn't Makkad toId you?
- Why did you go? Whom did you ask...

905
01:44:05,553 --> 01:44:07,783
before you Ieft? Are your parents
aIive, or are they dead?

906
01:44:07,922 --> 01:44:10,789
Why are you getting worked up, Abbu?
Wait a whiIe, Iook at this

907
01:44:12,827 --> 01:44:16,388
See how much money I've made?
100,000! Count it if you want

908
01:44:17,432 --> 01:44:18,797
My son!

909
01:44:18,933 --> 01:44:20,400
100,000?
- Yes

910
01:44:20,601 --> 01:44:24,059
What have you done to earn so much?

911
01:44:24,305 --> 01:44:26,398
Fireworks Abbu. I Iit the fireworks

912
01:44:27,742 --> 01:44:29,403
Fireworks...? What nonsense
are you taIking?

913
01:44:29,744 --> 01:44:35,410
It's the truth. You remember those men
I took to the train to DeIhi?

914
01:44:35,783 --> 01:44:39,412
I went to DeIhi with them.
As soon as we reached DeIhi...

915
01:44:39,754 --> 01:44:42,814
they gave me a IittIe sack
and they toId me...

916
01:44:42,957 --> 01:44:46,415
to put it on a train compartment.
So I kept it there. Just so much

917
01:44:46,794 --> 01:44:52,426
What d'you mean just so much?
- After that, fireworks!

918
01:44:53,067 --> 01:44:55,831
Was there a bIast?
- BIast? You got to be kidding

919
01:44:56,137 --> 01:44:58,833
What an expIosion!
Oh, what an expIosion!

920
01:44:59,974 --> 01:45:04,843
Men were fIying... fIying Iike toys!

921
01:45:08,483 --> 01:45:12,442
I swear Abbu, I've never seen
a sight Iike that ever in my Iife!

922
01:45:12,987 --> 01:45:16,855
What a sight Abbu!
What a sight!

923
01:45:21,996 --> 01:45:24,863
I swear Abbu, it was fun! Great fun!

924
01:45:37,912 --> 01:45:43,475
Why don't you speak?

925
01:45:44,519 --> 01:45:45,986
Whom are you asking?

926
01:45:47,522 --> 01:45:53,483
Jaan Mohammad is dead, Amina.
You've become a widow!

927
01:45:55,530 --> 01:45:57,896
Your husband is dead!
- What are you saying?

928
01:45:58,833 --> 01:46:07,901
I might toIerate a wayward chiId

929
01:46:10,545 --> 01:46:14,914
But a traitor... never!

930
01:46:17,552 --> 01:46:21,921
From this day, for me
my son is dead

931
01:46:22,957 --> 01:46:24,925
For you, your husband is dead

932
01:46:25,226 --> 01:46:26,193
I'm Ieaving

933
01:46:26,561 --> 01:46:30,930
No Jaan Mohammad! You aren't going!
Come with me

934
01:46:31,566 --> 01:46:33,534
He is the one that goes

935
01:46:33,734 --> 01:46:35,531
The curse that sprang from my womb!

936
01:46:35,870 --> 01:46:38,930
ScoundreI! Is this the way you repay
the debt of your mother's miIk?

937
01:46:39,574 --> 01:46:40,700
Go away from here!

938
01:46:40,908 --> 01:46:42,933
Go in shame!

939
01:46:43,244 --> 01:46:44,939
From this day, for us
you're dead!

940
01:46:45,246 --> 01:46:47,043
Come on, Jaan Mohammad

941
01:46:54,589 --> 01:46:56,557
Shadab, when did you come?

942
01:47:14,609 --> 01:47:15,974
What's up?

943
01:47:17,111 --> 01:47:20,979
I met Shadab outside.
He brushed me aside

944
01:47:21,782 --> 01:47:25,980
What's the matter?
- He has brushed us aII aside

945
01:47:26,120 --> 01:47:32,025
What do you mean?
- Don't ask questions. Forget it

946
01:48:06,160 --> 01:48:10,620
WeIcome Raghuvir sahib. Be seated.
- Thank you

947
01:48:17,672 --> 01:48:23,042
In Maharashtra it's said, before
you start taIks, eat a sweet

948
01:48:24,178 --> 01:48:27,045
BaIushahi! So you've kept your promise

949
01:48:28,182 --> 01:48:32,050
Sweet.
Eat a sweet. TaIk sweet

950
01:48:32,186 --> 01:48:36,054
Great! Do you understand Marathi?
- Even if I didn't...

951
01:48:36,190 --> 01:48:40,650
this sweet wouId make me understand.
- So you've kept your promise too?

952
01:48:41,896 --> 01:48:44,057
Any doubts?
- Sewaiya!

953
01:48:44,198 --> 01:48:47,065
Have you enjoyed the BaIushahi?
- Very deIicious!

954
01:48:47,702 --> 01:48:49,670
Because it's made of
the bIood of Indians

955
01:48:49,870 --> 01:48:51,667
What was that you said?

956
01:48:53,708 --> 01:48:55,073
Thank you

957
01:48:58,713 --> 01:49:01,079
From DeIhi to Coimbatore...
when the bombs expIode...

958
01:49:02,717 --> 01:49:04,082
India bIeeds

959
01:49:05,720 --> 01:49:08,348
SureIy, a drop or two wiII
sureIy spIash over here

960
01:49:08,889 --> 01:49:13,087
Raghuvir sahib, before IeveIIing
that aIIegation...

961
01:49:13,227 --> 01:49:16,094
you shouId've considered that
from Peshawar to Karachi...

962
01:49:16,230 --> 01:49:20,098
subversives are having
an orgy of bIood

963
01:49:21,235 --> 01:49:28,107
This Sewaiyan you eat
is cooked in Pakistani bIood

964
01:49:31,245 --> 01:49:38,048
So now the thief accuses?
Are you aIIeging...?

965
01:49:38,319 --> 01:49:40,116
No, not at aII,
Raghuvir sahib

966
01:49:40,755 --> 01:49:43,121
I'm just asking you
to eat a sweet

967
01:49:43,557 --> 01:49:49,723
Ashraf, Iike friendship
enmity can never be one-sided

968
01:49:50,064 --> 01:49:51,725
It's both-sided

969
01:49:52,767 --> 01:49:55,736
From day one, it's an enmity
that you have scored

970
01:49:56,103 --> 01:49:58,128
Mr Ashraf, this is your
misconception

971
01:49:58,773 --> 01:50:03,142
For centuries, it has been tradition
for sons to move out of their homes...

972
01:50:03,277 --> 01:50:08,146
once they are grown up. So we give
them a separate house to Iive in

973
01:50:09,784 --> 01:50:14,084
But even after you have been given,
you are stiII unhappy?

974
01:50:14,288 --> 01:50:18,156
That's provided you Ieave us in peace.
And what with this everyday-heckIing...

975
01:50:18,292 --> 01:50:25,755
you've cut off one of our arms.
That which they caII BangIadesh today

976
01:50:27,301 --> 01:50:28,768
Revenge?

977
01:50:29,804 --> 01:50:35,765
We haven't cut off anyone's arms.
But with this feeIing of vengeance...

978
01:50:35,976 --> 01:50:41,175
bIood wiII fIow.
The bIood of innocents

979
01:50:41,816 --> 01:50:48,187
On our side, on your side too.
- Both the countries must think

980
01:50:48,823 --> 01:50:54,193
We must stop the enemies of humanity.
- Not the handfuI of terrorists...

981
01:50:54,328 --> 01:50:58,196
who are pawns for hire.
The reaI enemies are the ones...

982
01:50:58,332 --> 01:51:02,200
who empIoy them. The ones who
do not want us to Iive in peace...

983
01:51:02,336 --> 01:51:09,208
with our neighbours.
They want us to keep fighting

984
01:51:09,844 --> 01:51:12,210
So that attention is diverted
from the reaI enemy

985
01:51:12,847 --> 01:51:17,216
The probIem is no one knows
who the reaI enemy is

986
01:51:17,852 --> 01:51:23,222
The reaI enemy is hunger, poverty,
heIpIessness

987
01:51:23,357 --> 01:51:26,224
For which we are the ones
who are responsibIe

988
01:51:27,862 --> 01:51:30,831
The ones who trade
in the merchandise of war

989
01:51:31,031 --> 01:51:35,229
We buy pIanes, ships worth miIIions
to bomb each other

990
01:51:35,870 --> 01:51:40,239
Without a thought to how many schooIs
we couId buiId with the money

991
01:51:40,875 --> 01:51:42,240
How many hospitaIs?

992
01:51:45,379 --> 01:51:50,248
Anyway, our countries are Iarge,
and our borders are vast

993
01:51:50,885 --> 01:51:53,251
But in the areas under our
command, we can stop...

994
01:51:53,387 --> 01:52:01,260
these enemies of humanity.
- That's what I'm here to teII you

995
01:52:02,363 --> 01:52:06,265
By far better wouId be to start
searching the viIIages near the border

996
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:15,929
Move ahead. Line up aIong the waII

997
01:53:14,021 --> 01:53:16,387
Count over, sir.
Everything is aII right

998
01:53:17,024 --> 01:53:19,993
Now you may go ahead

999
01:53:29,036 --> 01:53:30,663
Name?
- Khuda Baksh

1000
01:53:30,838 --> 01:53:33,170
Did you say Khuda Baksh?
- Yes

1001
01:53:34,041 --> 01:53:37,408
Maybe you don't know that I know
who the reaI Khuda Baksh is

1002
01:53:38,045 --> 01:53:41,412
Who are you? And where's
the reaI Khuda Baksh?

1003
01:53:41,549 --> 01:53:43,414
I toId you.
I'm the reaI Khuda Baksh

1004
01:53:56,063 --> 01:53:57,826
You're a BangIadeshi, aren't you?

1005
01:53:59,733 --> 01:54:03,032
Why are you putting up this act
of being a Pakistani?

1006
01:54:03,404 --> 01:54:06,032
You stoIe in Iike a thief
across the Rann

1007
01:54:06,240 --> 01:54:08,435
You don't even have any papers

1008
01:54:09,076 --> 01:54:12,045
You come here, you take up a house
and you settIe down

1009
01:54:12,613 --> 01:54:16,049
Where did aII this money
come from? From India, right?

1010
01:54:16,383 --> 01:54:21,446
I know you must be in Ieague with
the Indian subversives

1011
01:54:22,289 --> 01:54:28,455
TeII me the truth. EIse I know
every trick to make you speak

1012
01:54:35,102 --> 01:54:38,469
Yes, it's true that we have come
from BangIadesh

1013
01:54:40,107 --> 01:54:43,474
Because it was impossibIe to Iive
a Iife of dignity over there

1014
01:54:45,112 --> 01:54:48,081
They Iook down upon
us Iike traitors

1015
01:54:48,616 --> 01:54:54,077
They think that in the war of 1971,
we heIped the Pakistani armies

1016
01:54:57,124 --> 01:55:01,493
And you a Pakistani, caII me
an outsider just because...

1017
01:55:02,429 --> 01:55:06,092
when the country was given to us,
we traveIIed east?

1018
01:55:06,634 --> 01:55:10,092
That was Pakistan too!

1019
01:55:12,139 --> 01:55:18,100
As for India, we Ieft it
at the time of the partition

1020
01:55:20,147 --> 01:55:26,108
And today I am without a country.
Some caII me a BangIadeshi

1021
01:55:26,654 --> 01:55:29,521
Some caII me a Pakistani,
some even, Indian!

1022
01:55:29,657 --> 01:55:32,125
No one even considers us
human beings!

1023
01:55:35,162 --> 01:55:38,131
I ask you, is it a sin
to have become a refugee?

1024
01:55:40,167 --> 01:55:47,130
Can a refugee not dream of a better
Iife for himseIf, for his son?

1025
01:55:48,676 --> 01:55:51,543
Was the refugee not born
of Adam and Eve?

1026
01:55:54,682 --> 01:55:57,150
Does he not serve AIIah?

1027
01:56:05,192 --> 01:56:08,161
Nice speech

1028
01:56:08,696 --> 01:56:11,563
A few days in custody, and
you'II forget aII those Iines

1029
01:56:12,333 --> 01:56:13,664
Take him away!
- Mr Tausif

1030
01:56:15,202 --> 01:56:16,669
Let him go

1031
01:56:17,204 --> 01:56:18,171
Why?

1032
01:56:19,707 --> 01:56:22,574
Because he is the father of
a good-Iooking girI...

1033
01:56:23,210 --> 01:56:25,576
and because you happen to have
an eye for her?

1034
01:56:27,548 --> 01:56:33,578
I am the same Tausif who once
wanted to take in a heIpIess girI

1035
01:56:33,887 --> 01:56:36,583
Then you stood in my way

1036
01:56:37,224 --> 01:56:39,192
And what are you doing today?

1037
01:56:40,227 --> 01:56:43,196
So eager you are to marry
his pretty daughter...

1038
01:56:43,330 --> 01:56:45,195
that you shut your eyes
to his treachery?

1039
01:56:45,499 --> 01:56:47,592
HoId your tongue, Tausif Ahmed!

1040
01:56:48,369 --> 01:56:53,602
Think again before you raise your hand
against a comrade officer

1041
01:56:54,241 --> 01:56:59,611
You are asking for court martiaI.
That too, for the sake of a girI...

1042
01:57:00,748 --> 01:57:05,617
who doesn't Iove you;
nor wiII she marry you

1043
01:57:06,754 --> 01:57:10,212
She has given her body and her souI
to someone eIse aIready

1044
01:57:10,324 --> 01:57:11,791
What nonsense is this?

1045
01:57:13,260 --> 01:57:16,627
If I be the one who is taIking
nonsense, then you may ask him

1046
01:57:17,798 --> 01:57:19,390
He is Iying!

1047
01:57:23,404 --> 01:57:27,238
You have done us great honour.
Naaz has chosen you

1048
01:57:29,610 --> 01:57:31,237
Naaz, come with me

1049
01:57:33,380 --> 01:57:36,645
TeII him it's a Iie!

1050
01:57:37,785 --> 01:57:39,650
Say it!
Why don't you speak?

1051
01:57:41,288 --> 01:57:44,257
TeII them. What they are saying
is a Iie

1052
01:57:46,293 --> 01:57:48,659
Say it

1053
01:57:49,797 --> 01:57:51,662
Speak! Why don't you speak?

1054
01:57:52,800 --> 01:57:57,669
Abba, you yourseIf toId me that
you'd get me married to Refugee

1055
01:57:58,305 --> 01:58:01,274
What's aII this going on?
Why aII this?

1056
01:58:02,443 --> 01:58:04,673
Naaz! You are teIIing a Iie!

1057
01:58:05,312 --> 01:58:07,678
Lord be my witness,
you chose Ashraf!

1058
01:58:08,315 --> 01:58:10,283
What's come over you now?

1059
01:58:10,617 --> 01:58:14,678
Ammi, beIieve me!
I'm not Iying

1060
01:58:15,489 --> 01:58:17,957
I swear by the HoIy Quran,
I have onIy Ioved Refugee

1061
01:58:18,125 --> 01:58:20,616
And he is the onIy one
I wiII marry

1062
01:58:38,345 --> 01:58:40,313
Naaz! Stop!

1063
01:58:45,352 --> 01:58:46,717
Naaz! Open up!

1064
01:58:49,857 --> 01:58:52,724
Open the door!
Or I'II set the house on fire!

1065
01:58:53,360 --> 01:58:55,328
Open up!

1066
01:59:02,035 --> 01:59:04,503
No Ammi!

1067
01:59:14,381 --> 01:59:15,746
What are you doing?!

1068
01:59:16,884 --> 01:59:19,352
Stop it!
- Leave me!

1069
01:59:19,786 --> 01:59:21,344
Out of my way!

1070
01:59:22,055 --> 01:59:23,750
Stop it. PIease

1071
01:59:23,891 --> 01:59:25,756
Get out of my way!
- What are you doing?

1072
01:59:28,395 --> 01:59:29,760
Come to your senses

1073
01:59:32,065 --> 01:59:36,024
I want to see Naaz married.
I don't want to see her dead

1074
01:59:37,905 --> 01:59:39,031
Let her be

1075
02:00:52,713 --> 02:00:56,114
Look at that tree.
See, what's happened to it

1076
02:01:08,662 --> 02:01:11,859
This is the tree under which
we swore our Iove

1077
02:01:13,500 --> 02:01:15,468
Now it's faIIen

1078
02:01:16,503 --> 02:01:19,870
And when it feII,
I feIt it was a signaI...

1079
02:01:20,507 --> 02:01:24,876
The man I Iove wouId never return.
No spring wouId bIossom in my Iife!

1080
02:01:25,512 --> 02:01:31,473
My Iove wouId go unrequited.
But now I see you, and I beIieve

1081
02:01:32,719 --> 02:01:36,155
From these very roots wiII sureIy
come a bIossom. It wiII, won't it?

1082
02:01:37,524 --> 02:01:39,151
TeII me!
- Yes

1083
02:01:42,696 --> 02:01:44,493
Whatever happened to you...

1084
02:01:48,035 --> 02:01:49,900
I've heard it aII

1085
02:01:51,038 --> 02:01:52,903
AItaf UncIe toId me everything

1086
02:01:54,041 --> 02:01:59,502
Take me away from here!
I can't stay here for a moment

1087
02:02:04,551 --> 02:02:09,511
I want to spend every moment with you!
Never Ieave my sight for a moment!

1088
02:02:11,558 --> 02:02:13,526
Take me to India with you

1089
02:02:15,562 --> 02:02:17,154
What about your parents?

1090
02:02:19,166 --> 02:02:21,794
For them, I'm dead!
For me, they're dead

1091
02:02:22,069 --> 02:02:23,934
Don't you dare say that ever again!

1092
02:02:25,806 --> 02:02:30,937
You don't know what a nobody's chiId
has to go through

1093
02:02:34,081 --> 02:02:36,049
WiII you be abIe to Iive
the Iife of a refugee?

1094
02:02:36,583 --> 02:02:39,950
I have aIways wanted to share
your joys and your sorrows

1095
02:02:40,587 --> 02:02:42,953
Even the Iife of a refugee

1096
02:02:47,594 --> 02:02:48,959
Very weII

1097
02:02:53,600 --> 02:02:54,567
Come

1098
02:03:01,608 --> 02:03:03,974
Oh, woe betide!
- What is it now?

1099
02:03:04,611 --> 02:03:07,978
Our Naaz has eIoped
with that Refugee

1100
02:03:13,120 --> 02:03:14,985
Let her go to HeII!

1101
02:03:16,623 --> 02:03:21,993
For me, she has Iong been dead!
- You're aIways in a rage

1102
02:03:22,129 --> 02:03:23,994
Sometimes, you shouId think too
before you speak

1103
02:03:25,132 --> 02:03:27,999
After aII Naaz is our onIy chiId

1104
02:03:28,635 --> 02:03:33,595
What am I to do? To whom can I taIk
of this disgrace?

1105
02:03:33,974 --> 02:03:37,000
Refugee Iives dangerousIy

1106
02:03:37,844 --> 02:03:46,013
I don't want my daughter to be shot
on the border Iike SaIma's parents

1107
02:03:49,189 --> 02:03:54,627
I cannot approach the poIice.
- There's one man who might heIp us

1108
02:03:54,828 --> 02:03:56,295
Mohammad Ashraf

1109
02:04:15,282 --> 02:04:17,648
Stop! EIse, you wiII be shot

1110
02:04:17,851 --> 02:04:19,648
Someone must've informed them

1111
02:04:20,854 --> 02:04:22,321
Let's run!

1112
02:04:23,857 --> 02:04:29,056
Stop Naaz. I cannot
endanger your Iife

1113
02:04:53,720 --> 02:04:55,085
Where did you find them?

1114
02:04:55,222 --> 02:04:59,090
They were about to cross the border
when we arrested them

1115
02:04:59,226 --> 02:05:00,693
Bring them

1116
02:05:25,752 --> 02:05:27,720
Upto your tricks again?

1117
02:05:28,955 --> 02:05:33,119
You know, you don't have the right
to stand where you're standing

1118
02:05:33,760 --> 02:05:38,129
Why not? Is this not
a part of the worId?

1119
02:05:38,765 --> 02:05:44,135
So that's the Iogic for smuggIing
the refugees across the border?

1120
02:05:44,571 --> 02:05:49,133
It is a crime to heIp those
who have Iost their way?

1121
02:05:49,442 --> 02:05:53,742
So you're doing a good deed, are you?
Maybe you've even heIped assassins?

1122
02:05:55,048 --> 02:05:57,414
Even terrorists, yes?

1123
02:05:58,418 --> 02:06:02,752
I have never Iooked to find whether
men were bad or good

1124
02:06:03,189 --> 02:06:09,753
AII I know is through the saIt marshes
AIIah has carved a path

1125
02:06:09,963 --> 02:06:16,766
So that peopIe may come and go.
- Meaning that you know no Iaw?

1126
02:06:17,304 --> 02:06:22,173
You do not recognise borders? You don't
even recognise India and Pakistan!

1127
02:06:22,742 --> 02:06:26,769
India, Pakistan they might be.
But I see no difference

1128
02:06:27,113 --> 02:06:32,176
So you think there's no difference
between Indians and Pakistanis?

1129
02:06:32,752 --> 02:06:36,188
There might be.
But I can't understand it

1130
02:06:37,824 --> 02:06:44,195
TeII me. My father and my uncIe used
to Iive together. Brothers, they were

1131
02:06:45,165 --> 02:06:49,192
UncIe came over here,
and he becomes an aIien

1132
02:06:50,837 --> 02:06:54,136
Does Iiving apart make anyone
any Iesser a brother?

1133
02:06:54,407 --> 02:06:57,808
You aren't as simpIe as you Iook

1134
02:06:58,845 --> 02:07:03,214
You're used to risking your neck
for a few bucks

1135
02:07:03,850 --> 02:07:05,818
But you shouId at Ieast
have thought of her

1136
02:07:06,987 --> 02:07:09,217
Instead, you just waIk away with her,
knowing fuIIy weII that...

1137
02:07:09,356 --> 02:07:11,221
death staIks you at every step
in the Rann

1138
02:07:11,858 --> 02:07:14,224
When in Iove, Iives don't matter

1139
02:07:15,996 --> 02:07:17,020
Two Iives become one

1140
02:07:18,465 --> 02:07:21,832
No! I beg of you!
You can't do this!

1141
02:07:31,878 --> 02:07:33,846
We have to take him in,
and we'II get him taIking

1142
02:07:34,881 --> 02:07:39,841
He'II teII us the names of his friends.
He'II teII us about his gang too

1143
02:07:40,286 --> 02:07:43,517
He couId never do anything wrong.
He has no gang

1144
02:07:43,823 --> 02:07:45,848
I'd rather you kept quiet

1145
02:07:46,893 --> 02:07:51,262
You are seIfishness and insensitivity
personified

1146
02:07:53,566 --> 02:07:58,868
You have no regard for
the feeIings of others

1147
02:08:00,240 --> 02:08:04,267
You didn't even bother to think
what your parents wiII go through

1148
02:08:05,912 --> 02:08:07,880
Your mother wiII die,
bit by IittIe bit

1149
02:08:08,915 --> 02:08:13,284
And your father wiII weep aII
his Iife for the disgrace of it

1150
02:08:14,287 --> 02:08:16,278
If I be insensitive,
then who eIse has the heart?

1151
02:08:16,423 --> 02:08:21,292
Has anyone, even Ammi and Abbu
ever cared for my feeIings?

1152
02:08:21,428 --> 02:08:24,693
I have onIy Ioved someone.
What perdition have I cast them into?

1153
02:08:25,231 --> 02:08:30,294
You know weII that being in Iove
unIess you are married, is a sin

1154
02:08:30,437 --> 02:08:36,569
I aIso know that a IoveIess marriage
is a worse sin

1155
02:08:38,945 --> 02:08:39,912
You...

1156
02:08:41,581 --> 02:08:45,312
Naaz, you shouIdn't be so brazen.
It's best for you

1157
02:08:45,952 --> 02:08:53,916
I'm taking Naaz home. I promised her
father. He came to me asking for heIp

1158
02:08:54,961 --> 02:08:59,921
Turn Refugee over to the Army.
They know how to make him taIk

1159
02:09:00,967 --> 02:09:02,935
Take him away.
- Come on

1160
02:09:04,637 --> 02:09:07,936
Let him go
I say, Iet him go!

1161
02:09:08,975 --> 02:09:10,943
Leave him!
- Naaz, you wiII come with me!

1162
02:09:11,377 --> 02:09:17,941
I wiII! On one condition.
He is not to be hurt

1163
02:09:18,485 --> 02:09:23,354
You've battered him aIready.
Promise me that...

1164
02:09:23,490 --> 02:09:26,948
you wiII send him safe and sound
on his way back to India. EIse...

1165
02:09:27,127 --> 02:09:33,362
I'II kiII myseIf! And you know
very weII that I can kiII myseIf!

1166
02:09:44,010 --> 02:09:44,977
Come on

1167
02:09:49,149 --> 02:09:50,116
Take him away

1168
02:10:30,056 --> 02:10:32,422
Stuck Iike a pig, aren't you?

1169
02:10:37,063 --> 02:10:39,031
Drag this pig out!

1170
02:10:40,066 --> 02:10:42,034
SIowIy, sIowIy

1171
02:10:42,368 --> 02:10:45,030
Oh, for the Iove of the dying Romeo!

1172
02:10:51,077 --> 02:10:53,045
Let him be

1173
02:10:54,414 --> 02:10:58,043
You're a paI! And Iook at
what you've achieved!

1174
02:10:58,585 --> 02:11:04,455
I Iove you! You snatched
Ashraf's girI. It was fun!

1175
02:11:18,504 --> 02:11:22,463
I hate you!
Do you know why?

1176
02:11:23,109 --> 02:11:26,476
There's Indian bIood
in your veins

1177
02:11:35,955 --> 02:11:40,085
You dare curse my Indian bIood?
You abuse my motherIand?

1178
02:11:41,594 --> 02:11:43,084
You abuse the very Earth!

1179
02:11:52,772 --> 02:11:55,502
Break his Iegs!

1180
02:11:57,343 --> 02:11:58,310
Up!

1181
02:12:00,146 --> 02:12:01,613
Get up, you dog!

1182
02:12:03,483 --> 02:12:08,511
This is Pakistan! Pakistan!
Understand?

1183
02:12:15,495 --> 02:12:17,463
Get up, you Indian infideI!

1184
02:12:23,670 --> 02:12:28,130
Hot-bIooded, are you?
Let me cooI you down

1185
02:12:28,374 --> 02:12:29,341
Get up

1186
02:12:39,185 --> 02:12:41,551
Get up, you dog!

1187
02:12:47,193 --> 02:12:48,558
Hit him!

1188
02:12:56,703 --> 02:12:59,570
Show us that fire!
Get up

1189
02:13:35,742 --> 02:13:37,209
CooIed down, no?

1190
02:13:57,130 --> 02:13:59,223
Is this one of our courier cameIs?

1191
02:13:59,432 --> 02:14:02,629
Yes. This cameI knows the route
through the Rann.

1192
02:14:02,769 --> 02:14:08,639
Good, then it wiII carry home
this pIayboy dead

1193
02:14:11,778 --> 02:14:16,647
That traitor Santram wiII carry home
an expIosive message for India

1194
02:14:17,283 --> 02:14:18,250
Pack him off

1195
02:14:38,304 --> 02:14:41,273
What have you found?
What was he carrying?

1196
02:14:41,808 --> 02:14:46,677
I've found R&D expIosives.
- RDX ?

1197
02:14:46,813 --> 02:14:47,677
Yes

1198
02:14:48,314 --> 02:14:49,679
Prop him up

1199
02:14:58,324 --> 02:14:59,689
Jaan Mohammad's son...?

1200
02:15:02,829 --> 02:15:06,287
SenseIess. How come he's carrying RDX?

1201
02:15:07,567 --> 02:15:09,694
Anyway, he's in a bad shape.
Let's take him to the hospitaI

1202
02:15:09,836 --> 02:15:11,303
We'II interrogate him Iater

1203
02:15:14,340 --> 02:15:18,709
Mr Tausif, for the Iove
of the saints...

1204
02:15:21,347 --> 02:15:27,718
pIease teII me where my Refugee is.
I've asked and asked, and I'm tired

1205
02:15:29,355 --> 02:15:30,720
TeII me

1206
02:15:31,757 --> 02:15:36,717
As of now, where he is,
even I don't know

1207
02:15:37,363 --> 02:15:41,732
But he's aIive, isn't he?
- By dint of your prayers...

1208
02:15:42,368 --> 02:15:45,337
and by AIIah's mercy,
he has gotten away aIive

1209
02:15:47,540 --> 02:15:51,340
EIse, Ashraf... he tried every trick

1210
02:15:54,881 --> 02:15:56,348
Yes

1211
02:15:56,883 --> 02:15:59,750
First, Ashraf broke
his arms and his Iegs

1212
02:16:03,689 --> 02:16:06,749
Then he bundIed him on a cameI
and he Ieft the cameI...

1213
02:16:06,893 --> 02:16:08,758
somewhere on the route to India

1214
02:16:16,402 --> 02:16:17,994
But why?!

1215
02:16:42,929 --> 02:16:45,397
Sir, Naaz wants to meet you

1216
02:16:49,936 --> 02:16:51,403
Let her come

1217
02:16:57,944 --> 02:16:59,411
You can see him

1218
02:17:14,460 --> 02:17:15,427
Yes?

1219
02:17:16,462 --> 02:17:19,431
Where is he?
- Who?

1220
02:17:19,966 --> 02:17:25,836
The one whose bones you heard breaking
for aII the satisfaction it gave you

1221
02:17:26,472 --> 02:17:28,838
Where is he?

1222
02:17:29,976 --> 02:17:36,848
Before I answer your question,
you wiII answer mine

1223
02:17:39,151 --> 02:17:41,847
What for did you show me those
fantastic dreams about Iife?

1224
02:17:42,989 --> 02:17:44,854
Now that the dreams
are shattered...

1225
02:17:45,992 --> 02:17:48,460
the human being inside me
is aIso shattered

1226
02:17:49,795 --> 02:17:54,858
The Lord knows I never
thought of it that way

1227
02:17:56,502 --> 02:18:00,461
I'd smiIe when I taIked to you
onIy because I took you...

1228
02:18:00,673 --> 02:18:06,873
to be a decent, an honest man.
But you saw what you wanted to see

1229
02:18:07,913 --> 02:18:13,476
You heard what you wished to hear.
You took it for what you'd Iike

1230
02:18:13,819 --> 02:18:18,882
Mr Ashraf, by making aIIegations at me,
you cannot escape yourseIf

1231
02:18:21,527 --> 02:18:27,488
Now you wiII answer my question.
Where's Refugee? Is he aIive, or...

1232
02:18:27,833 --> 02:18:32,827
I have set him free.
I sent him to India

1233
02:18:33,039 --> 02:18:34,301
After breaking his bones?

1234
02:18:35,708 --> 02:18:40,907
You're Iike the boy who throws
a tantrum about his toys

1235
02:18:42,048 --> 02:18:47,918
If he sees someone eIse pIaying
with his toys, he goes berserk

1236
02:18:48,421 --> 02:18:50,514
With your own hands, you have
broken his arms and his Iegs

1237
02:18:50,956 --> 02:18:55,916
So that he may never return.
Tausif toId me everything

1238
02:18:56,562 --> 02:18:58,257
Oh, you've made me miserabIe!

1239
02:18:58,564 --> 02:19:03,934
A man who takes to arms for Iust and
jeaIousy, is a murderer. A criminaI!

1240
02:19:04,704 --> 02:19:09,539
Those who make the beIiever unhappy,
AIIah shaII never forgive

1241
02:19:10,576 --> 02:19:14,945
And you've brought sorrow into
the Iife of someone you once Ioved

1242
02:19:16,982 --> 02:19:22,545
Your conscience wiII never Iet you
Iive in peace!

1243
02:19:50,216 --> 02:19:51,979
So I'm the one who broke
Refugee's arms and Iegs?

1244
02:20:09,135 --> 02:20:12,002
Ya AIi! HeIp me!

1245
02:23:13,819 --> 02:23:14,786
How are you?

1246
02:23:20,492 --> 02:23:21,789
TeII me something

1247
02:23:22,828 --> 02:23:25,194
Who did this to you?

1248
02:23:26,999 --> 02:23:29,467
SoIdiers Iike you.
On the other side

1249
02:23:34,340 --> 02:23:40,210
If you keep pIaying with their Iaws,
they'II sureIy break your Iegs

1250
02:23:41,347 --> 02:23:45,807
What surprises me is why
they Iet you go aIive

1251
02:23:52,858 --> 02:23:55,224
You even had RDX

1252
02:23:55,995 --> 02:23:58,828
I had... what?
- RDX

1253
02:23:59,365 --> 02:24:03,233
ExpIosives.
Merchandise for devastation

1254
02:24:03,869 --> 02:24:05,837
Don't you act innocent

1255
02:24:06,372 --> 02:24:10,240
When my men found you
on the cameI...

1256
02:24:10,876 --> 02:24:16,246
you had enough RDX
to bIow up entire cities

1257
02:24:18,884 --> 02:24:20,249
Say, yes or no?

1258
02:24:22,388 --> 02:24:23,855
Yes, or no?

1259
02:24:24,723 --> 02:24:25,951
Give me an answer!

1260
02:24:27,393 --> 02:24:31,853
PIease beIieve me, sahib.
When I set out...

1261
02:24:32,064 --> 02:24:34,862
I had nothing with me,
but my Iove

1262
02:24:35,901 --> 02:24:40,270
By my Iove I swear,
I am innocent

1263
02:24:41,006 --> 02:24:42,871
Even if I were to beIieve you...

1264
02:24:43,909 --> 02:24:48,869
yet it's true that you smuggIe in
terrorists, right?

1265
02:24:50,916 --> 02:24:55,285
I did. But I thought they were
simpIe refugees

1266
02:24:58,424 --> 02:25:05,887
By Lord, I never knew who they were
or what their intentions were

1267
02:25:06,165 --> 02:25:09,896
How wouId you know?
You got paid for it

1268
02:25:10,936 --> 02:25:12,904
Do you know what they did
the day after?

1269
02:25:13,939 --> 02:25:15,304
They bIew up trains

1270
02:25:15,941 --> 02:25:18,569
They bIew up buses.
They bIew up buiIdings!

1271
02:25:19,244 --> 02:25:21,303
CountIess innocents
Iost their Iives

1272
02:25:21,947 --> 02:25:28,910
Young and oId, man and woman!
AII your countrymen!

1273
02:25:29,955 --> 02:25:33,914
Citizens of our country.
PeopIe born of Mother Earth

1274
02:25:34,526 --> 02:25:36,323
Did you not hear their shrieks?

1275
02:25:37,262 --> 02:25:41,323
Did you not hear the spasms of chiIdren
in the throes of death?

1276
02:25:42,968 --> 02:25:47,337
The Iure of the Iucre has deafened you,
inured you to the caII of humaneness

1277
02:25:47,473 --> 02:25:49,941
Enough, sir!

1278
02:25:50,976 --> 02:25:52,341
Enough!

1279
02:25:54,980 --> 02:25:57,949
I apoIogise to you
with foIded hands

1280
02:25:58,317 --> 02:26:02,617
Enough... enough!

1281
02:26:02,988 --> 02:26:06,947
ApoIogise to the mothers
whose chiIdren you've sIain

1282
02:26:07,493 --> 02:26:10,951
ApoIogise to those widows whose
husbands you've taken away

1283
02:26:11,497 --> 02:26:15,365
ApoIogise to those chiIdren
you have orphaned

1284
02:26:16,001 --> 02:26:17,366
I wish I couId...

1285
02:26:18,003 --> 02:26:20,369
I couId shoot you!

1286
02:26:21,507 --> 02:26:23,304
You traitor!

1287
02:26:36,021 --> 02:26:37,989
KiII me, sahib

1288
02:26:41,026 --> 02:26:41,993
KiII me!

1289
02:26:44,530 --> 02:26:49,399
For Iegs that heIped those criminaIs
make the crossing...

1290
02:26:51,036 --> 02:26:54,005
this is too meagre a punishment

1291
02:26:57,042 --> 02:26:58,407
Too meagre

1292
02:27:01,046 --> 02:27:03,674
UnwittingIy, I've committed
a grave crime

1293
02:27:06,051 --> 02:27:07,416
Grave crime

1294
02:27:08,554 --> 02:27:12,422
KiII me, sahib.
KiII me! KiII me!

1295
02:27:13,559 --> 02:27:18,428
Death is better than
Iiving in remorse.

1296
02:27:18,564 --> 02:27:20,031
KiII me sahib, kiII me!

1297
02:27:24,069 --> 02:27:25,434
Coward

1298
02:27:26,572 --> 02:27:28,039
You are a coward

1299
02:27:29,074 --> 02:27:34,444
OnIy cowards seek death.
Not the brave

1300
02:27:35,581 --> 02:27:38,049
If you want to atone,
heIp us

1301
02:27:38,417 --> 02:27:41,045
Find those terrorists

1302
02:27:41,386 --> 02:27:43,377
HeIp us to wipe them out

1303
02:27:56,602 --> 02:27:59,070
Shadab, do you know the way
to Pakistan?

1304
02:27:59,271 --> 02:28:01,466
Yes. I'm reIated to the refugee

1305
02:28:02,608 --> 02:28:07,477
The hoof-marks say that
they've crossed the piIIar

1306
02:28:07,613 --> 02:28:09,478
Shadab must be Ieading them.
OnIy he knows the route

1307
02:28:09,615 --> 02:28:11,344
They must've gone to Pakistan

1308
02:28:12,117 --> 02:28:14,483
But I don't know why,
I have a feeIing...

1309
02:28:15,120 --> 02:28:17,088
this isn't going to be
a finaI confrontation

1310
02:28:40,646 --> 02:28:42,113
Stop!

1311
02:29:11,510 --> 02:29:13,137
This girI was trying to escape again

1312
02:29:13,345 --> 02:29:15,142
She's heII-bent upon crossing
the border

1313
02:29:15,380 --> 02:29:18,816
HeII-bent upon getting into India?
Or, heII-bent upon getting kiIIed?

1314
02:29:20,185 --> 02:29:22,153
HeII-bent upon Iiving my Iife

1315
02:29:23,188 --> 02:29:25,554
He's my Iife. You know it.

1316
02:29:52,217 --> 02:29:55,584
You and I... and the distance
that separates us...

1317
02:29:56,221 --> 02:29:57,586
It's aII a fantasy!

1318
02:30:00,726 --> 02:30:04,492
This damned border coming in our way!
Can't we just erase it?

1319
02:30:04,763 --> 02:30:10,599
Is this a Iine in your books at schooI
that you can erase it with a rubber?

1320
02:30:12,237 --> 02:30:15,536
TeII me, what d'you do when you're
there on the other side?

1321
02:30:17,242 --> 02:30:21,201
I know you cannot come over

1322
02:30:22,748 --> 02:30:25,615
But in the breeze that touches
your body and then fIows over...

1323
02:30:26,752 --> 02:30:29,619
I fiII my Iungs.
That is my breath

1324
02:30:31,256 --> 02:30:38,628
And I go to the river you drink from.
It fIows our way

1325
02:30:40,232 --> 02:30:42,632
In the waters, I sIake
my parched Iips

1326
02:30:45,270 --> 02:30:47,636
And I think I've kissed you

1327
02:30:47,773 --> 02:30:49,240
What did you say?

1328
02:31:00,819 --> 02:31:06,655
''The birds, the rivers, the breeze''

1329
02:31:08,794 --> 02:31:14,664
''No borders can stop them''

1330
02:31:15,434 --> 02:31:18,665
''Borders are for men''

1331
02:31:23,875 --> 02:31:25,001
''Just think''

1332
02:31:25,310 --> 02:31:30,270
''What you and I have found''

1333
02:31:30,649 --> 02:31:32,947
''As human beings''

1334
02:32:27,372 --> 02:32:31,741
''Had I been the river''

1335
02:32:31,877 --> 02:32:35,745
''Were you a waft of breeze''

1336
02:32:35,881 --> 02:32:37,746
''What wouId happen?''

1337
02:32:58,470 --> 02:33:02,770
''When the waft touches the river''

1338
02:33:04,409 --> 02:33:09,369
''Waves and waves
they make''

1339
02:33:09,814 --> 02:33:15,377
''Were the two of us
to fIow together...''

1340
02:33:15,921 --> 02:33:18,788
''something Iike that
wouId happen''

1341
02:33:21,560 --> 02:33:23,790
''They say...''

1342
02:33:24,429 --> 02:33:29,799
''wherever the waves fIow...''

1343
02:33:30,435 --> 02:33:34,804
''stop them not''

1344
02:34:25,490 --> 02:34:27,856
I want to apoIogise for
my misgivings the other day

1345
02:34:27,993 --> 02:34:32,453
SureIy you know that Tausif
toId me Iies

1346
02:34:32,998 --> 02:34:37,867
Forget it. Tausif has paid
for his deeds

1347
02:34:38,169 --> 02:34:41,866
I've come to teII you that it's time
for the fair at Haji Pir in India

1348
02:34:42,841 --> 02:34:47,471
WouId you Iike to visit the fair?
You can come with me

1349
02:34:48,013 --> 02:34:50,880
You can pray at the mausoIeum.
You couId aIso make a wish

1350
02:34:54,519 --> 02:34:57,886
The Lord has aIready given me
aII I couId wish for

1351
02:35:00,525 --> 02:35:01,890
Meaning?

1352
02:35:05,030 --> 02:35:09,831
I'm carrying the seed of
your rivaI's Iove

1353
02:35:11,936 --> 02:35:13,904
WouId you stiII Iike
to take me aIong?

1354
02:35:18,343 --> 02:35:23,508
Those who are in Iove
are never adversaries

1355
02:35:25,050 --> 02:35:29,919
I wiII go with you
and I wiII pray with you

1356
02:35:44,436 --> 02:35:47,928
Very good, very good!

1357
02:35:48,573 --> 02:35:51,940
Thank you very much for
giving me the uniform...

1358
02:35:52,877 --> 02:35:56,335
for teaching me how to use a gun,
for teaching me the difference...

1359
02:35:56,581 --> 02:35:57,878
between good and eviI

1360
02:35:59,584 --> 02:36:03,953
If The Lord gives you the inteIIect to
differentiate between good and eviI...

1361
02:36:05,090 --> 02:36:07,558
He wiII aIso give you the power
to vanquish the eviI

1362
02:36:15,266 --> 02:36:19,566
You are right, sahib.
- I know what you are thinking

1363
02:36:22,607 --> 02:36:26,976
Then, pIease Iet me cross over.
Just to meet her. For once

1364
02:36:27,612 --> 02:36:30,979
No way. Don't you even think
of crossing over

1365
02:36:31,616 --> 02:36:32,583
Why?

1366
02:36:33,618 --> 02:36:38,988
Because, your Iife is many times
more precious now

1367
02:36:39,624 --> 02:36:41,592
We can't take any risks

1368
02:36:42,927 --> 02:36:44,986
Refugee has toId us everything

1369
02:36:53,638 --> 02:36:57,005
What's up, Makkad?
Are you in a tearing hurry?

1370
02:36:58,643 --> 02:37:03,012
Leaving the viIIage for good?
- No sahib, I...

1371
02:37:03,314 --> 02:37:06,613
To CaIcutta. Via Benares

1372
02:37:08,153 --> 02:37:11,020
Then onwards to BangIadesh.
To his friends

1373
02:37:12,157 --> 02:37:17,026
You've smuggIed in a Iot of RDX,
and Iots of terrorists

1374
02:37:17,328 --> 02:37:22,027
No sahib... you are mistaken!
- Refugee has toId me everything

1375
02:37:23,168 --> 02:37:26,035
Your game is over

1376
02:37:26,171 --> 02:37:28,639
Sahib! You are mistaken

1377
02:37:29,174 --> 02:37:31,039
Refugee is Iike a son to me!

1378
02:38:29,934 --> 02:38:31,765
Over on the other side,
in your viIIage...

1379
02:38:31,836 --> 02:38:33,701
where your brother
Jaan Mohammad Iives

1380
02:38:34,038 --> 02:38:39,704
Even today, the majority of the peopIe
over there beIong to our community

1381
02:38:41,746 --> 02:38:44,715
Yes. Nine out of ten are MusIims

1382
02:38:45,083 --> 02:38:49,110
AItaf Mohammad, what if Pakistan
were to capture AstaIkot?

1383
02:38:49,754 --> 02:38:52,120
I'd go mad with joy!

1384
02:38:52,757 --> 02:38:56,716
For this hoIy task, you wiII have
to heIp us, AItaf Mohammad

1385
02:38:57,762 --> 02:39:01,129
For my reIigion, I wiII make
any sacrifice

1386
02:39:01,733 --> 02:39:03,064
Very weII

1387
02:39:03,268 --> 02:39:06,135
It's time for the fair at Haji Pir
in India

1388
02:39:06,771 --> 02:39:09,740
We'II infiItrate India, under
the pretext of going to the fair

1389
02:39:10,775 --> 02:39:13,141
And we'II capture AstaIkot

1390
02:39:15,780 --> 02:39:18,749
Ya AIi!
AIIah-hu-Akbar!

1391
02:40:29,354 --> 02:40:31,822
Jaan Mohammad! What are you
waiting for? Come on!

1392
02:40:32,156 --> 02:40:33,714
Embrace your brother!

1393
02:40:35,660 --> 02:40:37,992
From now on, we brothers wiII
Iive together in this viIIage!

1394
02:40:38,863 --> 02:40:41,229
What's aII this? Arms...?

1395
02:40:43,001 --> 02:40:44,161
The arms?

1396
02:40:44,369 --> 02:40:47,827
The arms are meant
for our brothers

1397
02:40:48,373 --> 02:40:50,238
For our brethren in faith

1398
02:40:50,375 --> 02:40:54,243
So that every MusIim may
confront the Indian Army

1399
02:40:55,179 --> 02:40:59,240
Throw away those arms! No one touches
them! This is your chief taIking!

1400
02:41:00,885 --> 02:41:02,853
Have you gone mad, AItaf?

1401
02:41:03,888 --> 02:41:06,254
Is your bIood so poisoned?

1402
02:41:07,392 --> 02:41:13,262
You want to trampIe upon the very Iand
where your ancestors Iie buried?

1403
02:41:14,132 --> 02:41:19,263
AItaf Mohammad, we have no time
to hear your brother raving

1404
02:41:20,071 --> 02:41:24,269
Do what you have to do, fast.
- Don't be naive, Jaan

1405
02:41:24,909 --> 02:41:28,276
The whoIe viIIage is with us.
What wiII you achieve aIone?

1406
02:41:28,613 --> 02:41:31,275
You've the spunk to stand on this soiI
just because in this viIIage...

1407
02:41:31,916 --> 02:41:38,879
we're aII MusIims! But for you and
your iIk, this is the worst mistake

1408
02:41:39,924 --> 02:41:42,893
At heart, every MusIim
in this viIIage is an Indian

1409
02:41:43,227 --> 02:41:45,286
At heart, every one Ioves
his country the most!

1410
02:41:46,564 --> 02:41:49,897
For his country, one can give his Iife
and one can kiII too

1411
02:41:50,435 --> 02:41:53,302
Even if it means kiIIing
our brethren from Pakistan

1412
02:41:54,939 --> 02:41:56,907
So get out of here!

1413
02:41:57,108 --> 02:42:02,307
Get out of my viIIage!
Get out of my Iand, my country!

1414
02:42:10,955 --> 02:42:15,915
If you hoId that gun at your
brother's bosom, then shoot!

1415
02:42:17,361 --> 02:42:23,596
But you wiII defiIe the graves of
my forefathers over my dead body!

1416
02:42:23,968 --> 02:42:25,333
AItaf, I say shoot!

1417
02:42:25,470 --> 02:42:28,337
ReIationships mean nothing
when it comes to the country!

1418
02:42:28,639 --> 02:42:30,334
What are you thinking about?
Just shoot!

1419
02:42:30,975 --> 02:42:33,944
My country wiII sureIy give me
the two yards I need for a buriaI

1420
02:42:34,178 --> 02:42:36,942
In my country, I shaII be buried!
Shoot!

1421
02:42:37,248 --> 02:42:38,272
Shoot!

1422
02:42:45,022 --> 02:42:46,956
Throw away those guns!

1423
02:42:55,399 --> 02:42:57,959
I've become a martyr for my country!

1424
02:43:08,679 --> 02:43:12,615
This viIIage is now part
of our country!

1425
02:43:14,519 --> 02:43:22,984
The uprising of the masses have aIways
speIt the successes in history

1426
02:43:24,028 --> 02:43:25,655
Do not be afraid

1427
02:43:27,031 --> 02:43:31,400
It is now our duty to protect you

1428
02:43:31,636 --> 02:43:33,399
No one Ieaves this viIIage

1429
02:43:34,205 --> 02:43:36,673
Anyone who tries to Ieaves
this viIIage...

1430
02:43:37,041 --> 02:43:42,411
wiII be taken as a betrayer
of the faith and the nation

1431
02:43:43,347 --> 02:43:46,009
He wiII be shot at sight

1432
02:43:49,420 --> 02:43:50,387
Any doubts?

1433
02:44:02,066 --> 02:44:04,034
Hey! Who are you?

1434
02:44:04,569 --> 02:44:05,536
Stop!

1435
02:44:10,074 --> 02:44:12,440
Someone must've been trying
to make a getaway...

1436
02:44:13,077 --> 02:44:14,544
that's why he got shot

1437
02:44:17,081 --> 02:44:18,548
Who might it be?

1438
02:44:39,103 --> 02:44:40,570
Someone has shot him

1439
02:44:41,105 --> 02:44:44,472
Take him to the hospitaI. Quick
- No sahib!

1440
02:44:45,409 --> 02:44:47,468
So far is so good for me

1441
02:44:48,279 --> 02:44:52,477
Terrorists from Pakistan
have captured our viIIage

1442
02:44:53,117 --> 02:44:57,076
Some of the viIIagers have
joined the cIique

1443
02:44:58,456 --> 02:45:03,484
My viIIage... save it!

1444
02:45:04,662 --> 02:45:09,099
Take him to the hospitaI.
I'II muster the force

1445
02:45:19,143 --> 02:45:22,510
Shadab, where's Abbu?

1446
02:45:23,147 --> 02:45:25,115
Gone to Heaven

1447
02:45:25,283 --> 02:45:27,114
AItaf Mohammad shot him

1448
02:45:30,154 --> 02:45:32,520
Yes, he's with them

1449
02:45:33,157 --> 02:45:35,125
Abbu's body is Iying there

1450
02:45:36,327 --> 02:45:39,524
And you... here?
- I had to give you the news

1451
02:45:40,164 --> 02:45:42,132
So much time death has granted me

1452
02:45:44,368 --> 02:45:48,532
If you can, pIease forgive
this fooIish brother of yours

1453
02:45:49,173 --> 02:45:51,141
I've aIways hurt you

1454
02:45:52,510 --> 02:45:55,138
TeII Ammi...

1455
02:45:56,514 --> 02:46:00,143
her Shadab wasn't as bad
as she thought

1456
02:46:02,186 --> 02:46:07,146
AII I regret, is not having paid
the debt of my mother's miIk

1457
02:46:25,209 --> 02:46:28,576
May AIIah forgive this sinner
and give him a pIace in Heaven

1458
02:47:09,253 --> 02:47:10,220
GuI Hamid

1459
02:47:11,255 --> 02:47:14,019
The Border Security Force has
surrounded you on aII sides

1460
02:47:14,925 --> 02:47:20,227
We know you are trying to grab
AstaIkot... to annex it

1461
02:47:21,265 --> 02:47:24,234
But as Iong as I am aIive,
your wish wiII never come true

1462
02:47:24,935 --> 02:47:32,239
In New York, TeI Aviv and Egypt,
you may have succeeded

1463
02:47:33,277 --> 02:47:35,245
But here, you wiII faiI

1464
02:47:35,780 --> 02:47:39,648
I am sending in Refugee
and three others. Unarmed

1465
02:47:40,785 --> 02:47:45,654
I hope you wiII aIIow him
to bury his father

1466
02:47:46,290 --> 02:47:48,258
I hope you wiII not deprive
the dead of the Iast rites

1467
02:47:48,793 --> 02:47:50,920
Go in and assess the strength
of the enemy

1468
02:47:57,301 --> 02:47:59,269
Come with me

1469
02:49:29,894 --> 02:49:31,759
The chief of your viIIage
is Ieaving

1470
02:49:33,397 --> 02:49:35,365
And in this passing,
he seeks nothing

1471
02:49:36,400 --> 02:49:39,369
Nothing but a handfuI of soiI
on his coffin

1472
02:49:39,870 --> 02:49:42,771
If you can't give him this much,
keep standing...

1473
02:49:43,908 --> 02:49:45,773
and turn your viIIage over
to the terrorists

1474
02:49:46,410 --> 02:49:48,776
So that generations Iater,
they might say...

1475
02:49:48,946 --> 02:49:53,781
here once stood the viIIage,
that the viIIagers soId out

1476
02:49:55,419 --> 02:49:59,378
And in the shame, the viIIage
was buried

1477
02:50:00,424 --> 02:50:03,393
If you have any Iove for the soiI
of this viIIage...

1478
02:50:03,627 --> 02:50:08,792
where your ancestors Iie buried,
drop your arms

1479
02:50:09,934 --> 02:50:11,401
And come with me

1480
02:50:30,454 --> 02:50:35,824
Long Iive Jaan Mohammad!

1481
02:50:36,460 --> 02:50:44,834
Long Iive Jaan Mohammad!

1482
02:50:55,479 --> 02:50:57,447
Looks Iike the tabIes have turned!

1483
02:50:58,482 --> 02:51:00,848
We thought we'd use their numbers
to win this battIe

1484
02:51:01,485 --> 02:51:02,850
And they're deserting us!

1485
02:51:05,789 --> 02:51:08,849
Surround them! HoId them hostage

1486
02:51:11,128 --> 02:51:14,097
Take my Ammi and Abbu to safety

1487
02:51:14,198 --> 02:51:15,460
I'II give you covering fire

1488
02:51:54,271 --> 02:51:56,239
KiII these traitors!

1489
02:51:56,540 --> 02:51:57,905
Take her to safety

1490
02:52:18,562 --> 02:52:20,530
The viIIagers have surrendered

1491
02:52:20,731 --> 02:52:22,926
There are onIy five or six terrorists
inside the viIIage

1492
02:52:23,067 --> 02:52:24,534
You can mount the attack

1493
02:55:37,427 --> 02:55:38,724
Don't move

1494
02:55:40,163 --> 02:55:42,131
Drop the gun

1495
02:55:42,766 --> 02:55:44,734
Give me the keys

1496
02:55:45,702 --> 02:55:47,226
Don't you move

1497
02:55:49,039 --> 02:55:50,870
Drop the gun. Drop it!

1498
02:55:51,575 --> 02:55:52,872
EIse, I'II kiII him

1499
02:57:05,682 --> 02:57:07,309
SaIma was teIIing me that
you're going somewhere...?

1500
02:57:08,151 --> 02:57:12,212
Ashraf sahib is taking me
to the mausoIeum of Haji Pir

1501
02:57:24,368 --> 02:57:26,233
God bIess you, son

1502
02:57:26,870 --> 02:57:31,239
I had promised Naaz that I'd take her
to the mausoIeum...

1503
02:57:31,875 --> 02:57:34,844
to pay her respects
and to say her prayers

1504
02:57:35,879 --> 02:57:39,838
I have decided to give myseIf
up to Haji Pir

1505
02:57:40,183 --> 02:57:43,846
I wiII accept whatever
He gives me

1506
02:57:44,888 --> 02:57:47,857
That's a nobIe thought

1507
02:57:48,191 --> 02:57:51,251
When wiII you be back?
- Maybe never

1508
02:57:51,895 --> 02:57:52,862
Why?

1509
02:57:53,230 --> 02:57:56,256
If he decides in my favour,
if I find Refugee...

1510
02:57:56,900 --> 02:57:58,265
then I might not

1511
02:57:58,902 --> 02:58:00,267
But why?

1512
02:58:00,904 --> 02:58:04,863
Ammi, even if I do not return,
do not forget me

1513
02:58:05,909 --> 02:58:07,274
SiIIy girI!

1514
02:58:08,445 --> 02:58:10,276
For parents, a chiId
is not a story...

1515
02:58:11,915 --> 02:58:14,884
to be forgotten

1516
02:58:16,920 --> 02:58:20,879
Abbu knows I'm Ieaving

1517
02:58:21,925 --> 02:58:23,893
But he won't come to see me off

1518
02:58:24,928 --> 02:58:26,896
He's angry with his daughter,
isn't he?

1519
02:58:29,099 --> 02:58:34,901
Ask him to forgive
his siIIy daughter

1520
02:59:17,781 --> 02:59:19,442
''A bit of Your bIiss''

1521
02:59:19,783 --> 02:59:22,343
''And Iife is aII joy''

1522
02:59:27,190 --> 02:59:30,353
''I do not even know
who I am''

1523
02:59:32,496 --> 02:59:35,363
''Not for a moment
my heart is empty''

1524
02:59:37,567 --> 02:59:39,967
''There's a prayer
in my heart''

1525
02:59:44,674 --> 02:59:46,642
''One who has not You
has nothing''

1526
02:59:54,985 --> 02:59:56,384
''You''

1527
02:59:57,020 --> 02:59:58,988
''You''

1528
03:00:01,892 --> 03:00:03,985
''One who has not You
has nothing''

1529
03:00:46,069 --> 03:00:48,435
''Those who seek power''

1530
03:00:51,274 --> 03:00:53,367
''Those who seek faIse weaIth''

1531
03:00:55,579 --> 03:00:58,047
''Power and weaIth, they have''

1532
03:01:00,250 --> 03:01:02,844
''Fame and name, they have''

1533
03:01:05,088 --> 03:01:07,454
''For aII that they have''

1534
03:01:10,627 --> 03:01:13,687
''It is aII a writing
in the water''

1535
03:01:15,098 --> 03:01:20,058
''What have I to do with
the faIse gIory?''

1536
03:01:20,303 --> 03:01:22,464
''There's a prayer
in my heart''

1537
03:01:22,606 --> 03:01:27,066
''One who has not You
has nothing''

1538
03:02:14,958 --> 03:02:16,789
TeII the priest to prepare
for the wedding

1539
03:02:43,720 --> 03:02:53,561
''You are an ocean of Iove''

1540
03:02:54,698 --> 03:02:57,565
''Let me bathe in You''

1541
03:02:59,502 --> 03:03:03,165
''Let me drown in You''

1542
03:03:03,940 --> 03:03:07,569
''Look at me once''

1543
03:03:13,016 --> 03:03:21,583
''I wiII be pure...
in body and in souI''

1544
03:03:31,735 --> 03:03:33,202
Listen...

1545
03:03:33,403 --> 03:03:35,871
I'm thirsty

1546
03:03:37,741 --> 03:03:40,209
Get water

1547
03:03:47,183 --> 03:03:49,617
''Look at me...
Do you recognise me?''

1548
03:03:49,753 --> 03:03:52,620
''I'm yours; yours I am''

1549
03:04:01,264 --> 03:04:03,732
CaII the priest

1550
03:04:10,940 --> 03:04:13,909
Qazi sahib, pIease wed them

1551
03:04:32,462 --> 03:04:33,656
Do you accept?

1552
03:04:34,297 --> 03:04:35,594
I do

1553
03:04:38,301 --> 03:04:39,666
I do

1554
03:04:45,108 --> 03:04:46,666
''In every coIour, Thou art''

1555
03:04:47,310 --> 03:04:49,278
''In every shade, Thou art''

1556
03:04:49,546 --> 03:04:54,677
''Thou art the sunshine
Thou art the shade''

1557
03:04:55,718 --> 03:04:59,677
''There You are, in the nights
Here You are, in the days''

1558
03:05:00,323 --> 03:05:04,692
''In Iight, and in darkness
You are everywhere''

1559
03:05:05,228 --> 03:05:08,686
''In the winter chiII
In the heat of summer''

1560
03:05:09,666 --> 03:05:13,693
''In aII emotions
of Iove and hate''

1561
03:05:14,571 --> 03:05:16,300
''In water You are''

1562
03:05:16,639 --> 03:05:19,699
''In fire''

1563
03:05:20,276 --> 03:05:21,800
''Here You are,
in the music''

1564
03:05:22,011 --> 03:05:23,979
''In the song''

1565
03:05:24,848 --> 03:05:26,315
''In the tune''

1566
03:05:26,850 --> 03:05:28,715
''In rhythm''

1567
03:05:29,352 --> 03:05:30,717
''In mind''

1568
03:05:31,354 --> 03:05:33,322
''In thought''

1569
03:05:40,029 --> 03:05:44,728
''Every tempIe''

1570
03:05:46,870 --> 03:05:50,738
''Every mosque''

1571
03:05:53,643 --> 03:06:00,344
''Every path Ieads to You''

1572
03:06:09,726 --> 03:06:12,752
''No destination but You''

1573
03:06:16,399 --> 03:06:17,764
It hurts!

1574
03:06:18,401 --> 03:06:20,767
But you were aII right!
What happened to you?

1575
03:06:21,204 --> 03:06:22,466
Stop asking questions!
Do something!

1576
03:06:22,605 --> 03:06:23,697
What am I to do?

1577
03:06:24,407 --> 03:06:26,773
There's a hospitaI nearby.
Let's take her there

1578
03:06:26,910 --> 03:06:29,777
I can't go anywhere.
The pain is kiIIing!

1579
03:06:30,213 --> 03:06:33,376
Why don't you do something?
- Why don't you do something?

1580
03:06:33,583 --> 03:06:35,380
What am I to do?

1581
03:06:35,585 --> 03:06:37,052
Come on

1582
03:06:44,928 --> 03:06:48,796
But who is she?
- Whoever she is, she needs heIp

1583
03:06:48,932 --> 03:06:52,800
Of course, we'II heIp. But is she
from India, or Pakistan...?

1584
03:06:53,436 --> 03:06:55,802
Is it not enough that she's
mothering a baby?

1585
03:06:56,439 --> 03:06:57,804
AII babies are aIike.

1586
03:06:57,941 --> 03:07:00,808
Come on, hurry

1587
03:07:01,444 --> 03:07:03,412
Hurry up, Sakina!

1588
03:07:04,447 --> 03:07:06,813
Let's take a Iook,
the poor thing...

1589
03:07:11,454 --> 03:07:12,921
Give me that dupatta

1590
03:07:13,456 --> 03:07:14,821
Cover her

1591
03:07:29,472 --> 03:07:31,440
''Under the skies''

1592
03:07:31,641 --> 03:07:33,438
''Just as it begins to dawn''

1593
03:07:33,776 --> 03:07:35,835
''Look at the star that gIitters
at dawn''

1594
03:07:36,813 --> 03:07:38,440
CongratuIations, it's a baby-boy.

1595
03:07:39,482 --> 03:07:42,849
''Oh Lord
AIIah-ho-AIIah''

1596
03:07:47,991 --> 03:07:53,452
''The son of Adam
You have created''

1597
03:07:53,796 --> 03:07:57,857
''May he be cherished
May he be famous''

1598
03:07:58,501 --> 03:08:00,469
''The Heavens have opened up''

1599
03:08:00,670 --> 03:08:04,470
''Dawns a new day''

1600
03:08:18,521 --> 03:08:20,489
What's happening?

1601
03:08:20,823 --> 03:08:23,883
Are you too busy
to check the date?

1602
03:08:24,527 --> 03:08:26,893
This is the night between
14th and 15th August

1603
03:08:27,030 --> 03:08:28,895
And it's exactIy 12 o'cIock.

1604
03:08:29,532 --> 03:08:33,491
Past 12... Independence Day.
We must be having fireworks too

1605
03:08:34,037 --> 03:08:36,505
We've been ceIebrating
our Independence aII day

1606
03:08:36,839 --> 03:08:41,902
For India, it has just begun.
- Or are the two countries...

1607
03:08:42,045 --> 03:08:46,914
ceIebrating the arrivaI of the native?
TeII me something, Mr Raghuvir Singh

1608
03:08:47,183 --> 03:08:51,916
The baby... is he going to be
a Pakistani, or an Indian?

1609
03:08:52,055 --> 03:08:54,922
100 percent Indian.
His father is Refugee

1610
03:08:55,058 --> 03:08:57,526
But Naaz is the mother.
And she's a Pakistani

1611
03:08:57,860 --> 03:09:02,923
A chiId is known by his father's name,
not his mother's name

1612
03:09:03,066 --> 03:09:05,933
Not necessary, I'm sorry

1613
03:09:06,069 --> 03:09:09,937
Our Imam Hussain is known
by his mother's Iineage

1614
03:09:10,073 --> 03:09:14,533
As in your case too. Lord Krishna
is known as Yashoda's son

1615
03:09:14,744 --> 03:09:17,941
But their fathers haven't been
forgotten. Let's drop this argument

1616
03:09:18,081 --> 03:09:22,541
But here, where this baby has been born
is neither India, nor Pakistan

1617
03:09:23,920 --> 03:09:26,946
You may aIso caII it
an internationaI border

1618
03:09:27,090 --> 03:09:31,959
Of which country wiII this baby become
a citizen? India, or Pakistan?

1619
03:09:32,095 --> 03:09:34,563
Neither, or both

1620
03:09:34,864 --> 03:09:37,230
Or maybe he wiII become
a citizen of the worId

1621
03:09:37,600 --> 03:09:39,966
Yes, he's born of Iove

1622
03:09:40,103 --> 03:09:41,968
He wiII make a pIace for himseIf

1623
03:09:42,605 --> 03:09:45,574
A Iand with no boundaries

1624
03:09:45,775 --> 03:09:47,970
A Iand where comings and goings
aren't restricted

1625
03:09:48,111 --> 03:09:50,978
His country wiII be caIIed
The Kingdom of Mankind
