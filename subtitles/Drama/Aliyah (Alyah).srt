1
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,400
Next time you want 25 grams,
tell me first, ok?

2
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,960
Yeah ok. I'll try.

3
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,200
- There won't be a next time.
- What?

4
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,560
I'm out.

5
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,600
Are you sure?
What else do you know how to do?

6
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,320
- Erase my number. Ok?
- Yeah.

7
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,280
I'll call you next week.

8
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,920
Alex Raphaelson, come here.

9
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,560
Don't worry,
I'm your brother's friend.

10
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,960
Come here I said.

11
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,840
Tell him I want to talk to him.
It's important. My name is Claude.

12
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,160
- Are you ignoring me?
- You're ignoring me.

13
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,400
- No, I am in hell. A kiss?
- No. Let me go.

14
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,080
No kiss!

15
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,840
Alex, look at what I found for you.

16
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,880
Look.

17
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,280
It's a picture of Grandpa.

18
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,800
Mom always said you look alike.

19
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,480
Take it. I got it for you.

20
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,760
- Alex, help me out.
- I just gave you 1 grand.

21
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,960
Remember?

22
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,960
- Another grand.
- I can't.

23
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,920
- I'll pay you back in a week.
- I can't.

24
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,640
Fuck off, Isaac.
What about me?

25
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,640
I wouldn't ask you,
if I didn't need it.

26
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,320
Do you want me on my knees,
is that it?

27
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,400
Is that it? Say it.

28
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,800
I'm struggling right now.

29
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'll pay you back next week.

30
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,520
Worst case, I'll get you a watch.

31
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,040
No. It's ok.

32
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,560
Take this.

33
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,520
It's all I have.

34
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,040
Shit!

35
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,680
You're a real lifesaver, Alex.

36
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,760
- Can I kiss you now?
- No.

37
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,120
Finally! Come here.

38
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,400
Hi Auntie.

39
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,560
- How are you?
- Fine. You?

40
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,120
Nathan, look who's here.

41
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,280
Well, I'll say...

42
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,240
You? Here for Shabbat?
Nothing to eat at home?

43
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,760
Silly. He's here
to see his favorite cousin.

44
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,640
Don't listen to this schmuck.

45
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,280
Come here. Let me hug you.

46
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,640
Did you leave your hair in Israel?

47
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,080
Ok. Go join the guests.

48
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,960
And you, come with me. This way.

49
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,960
You could stay in touch you know.

50
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm worried about you.

51
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,360
I'm fine.

52
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,280
Really?

53
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,960
Really, I am fine.

54
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,920
You never pick up when I call.

55
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,400
And your brother?

56
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,480
He's fine.

57
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,840
But I don't see him that often.

58
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,000
Good. Go see your cousin.

59
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,800
He missed you.

60
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,560
- How are you?
- Fine.

61
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,680
Hi Gabriel.

62
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,000
- Hello.
- Hi.

63
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,080
- She didn't know?
- Not a word since I left...

64
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,840
- I didn't think you'd come.
- Me neither.

65
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,160
This is Jeanne,

66
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,960
a goy who wants to spend
Shabbat with bad Jews.

67
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,840
- Hi, goy friend.
- Hi.

68
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,240
- Oh sorry.
- Is your fiancé here?

69
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,560
He left to buy cigs
4 days ago and no news since.

70
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,640
- Should I worry?
- Yes. 4 days is a lot.

71
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,840
I think the gefilte fish
is calling us, hear it?

72
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,360
- I hear it.
- Come on, let's go.

73
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,880
You don't know any Hebrew, do you?

74
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,440
- I know shalom.
- Shabbat shalom.

75
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,560
Do you know what it means?

76
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,360
It means...

77
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,440
Amen.

78
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,560
Hello. How are you?

79
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,720
Good evening, everyone.

80
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,320
I'm here to save private Nathan.
Where is he?

81
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,800
There he is.

82
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,000
Hi Auntie. How are you?

83
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,560
Hi, Isaac.

84
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,800
This is for you.

85
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,720
It is beautiful.

86
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,240
Hi Dad.

87
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,440
Where were you?

88
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,520
You're the one who disappeared.

89
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,520
Not true.

90
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,680
- Yes it is.
- Look.

91
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,000
Oh, thanks.

92
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,120
Not spoiling him! This was a promise.

93
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,160
It's true. I can confirm.

94
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,000
You don't come and say hi?

95
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,560
How are you?

96
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,880
Well. You?
It's so good to see you.

97
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,720
- What has changed?
- This.

98
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,560
A toast for the madman who
tried his luck in a crazy country.

99
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,440
Are you ok?

100
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,880
Oh, shit!

101
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,000
Excuse me. It's my partner,
I need to get this.

102
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,600
Hello?

103
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,480
So Esther's getting married?

104
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,320
Did you think
she would wait for you?

105
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,280
Well, no. But isn't this really fast?

106
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,840
He must have been convincing.
He wasn't her type.

107
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,240
- And exactly what was her type?
- Well, me.

108
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,600
But her girlfriend...

109
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,280
If she turns around, she likes me.

110
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,040
She's not turning around.

111
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,480
Look at me.

112
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,400
Damn it! You asshole.

113
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,000
I don't get it.

114
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,880
Pay up with a smoke, huh?

115
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,600
So, what have you been doing lately?

116
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,160
I get by.

117
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,440
- You? How was the army?
- Why bring it up? It's over.

118
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,440
What'll you do now?

119
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,440
- Someone's curious.
- C'mon Nathan, tell me.

120
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,840
I'm opening a restaurant in Tel Aviv,
with 2 guys from the army,

121
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,720
renovating an old workshop.

122
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,280
Do you know La Mezzanine,
at Odéon?

123
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,160
It'll be like that.

124
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,120
Dinner till 11pm, midnight.

125
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,880
And then, you dance.

126
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,280
It'll be a hit.

127
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,040
Can you pack me up
in your suitcase?

128
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,000
What?

129
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,120
Can you put me in your suitcase?

130
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,320
Hey, have a little
something to smoke?

131
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,920
No.

132
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,440
- Nothing.
- You?

133
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,000
- No, I gotta go.
- Already?

134
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,440
- What's with him?
- I don't know.

135
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,720
Alex, wait.

136
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,320
- We need to talk.
- No.

137
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,160
You don't know what I want to say.
You think I want money?

138
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:13,200
I'm not asking for any,
I'm paying you back.

139
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,000
- You listening?
- Yes.

140
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,200
Remember the pharmacist, Rebecca?

141
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,880
I had a little fling with her.

142
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,280
She thinks that I'm leaving Anaëlle.

143
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,320
I said too much.
She wants to tell her everything.

144
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,440
- So...?
- Go and tell her

145
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,000
that I won't leave my wife or my son.

146
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,920
I don't believe this.

147
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,440
- I will not leave them.
- Are you kidding me?

148
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,040
It won't cost you.
If you tell her, she'll listen.

149
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,160
- It's your life.
- I know, but...

150
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,200
Let go of me.

151
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,560
What do you even...

152
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,440
Isaac? There you are.

153
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,080
Coming.

154
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,760
- Do you ever sleep?
- You're up too!

155
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,600
No noise. Mom's sleeping.

156
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,080
- Go left.
- Into your room?

157
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,320
- You ok?
- Yeah, fine.

158
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,720
Why the long face?

159
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,920
Thinking about what you said
about the restaurant, Israel and...

160
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,040
I thought that...

161
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,760
Maybe it would
be good for me too.

162
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,640
I could help you. I don't know.

163
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,280
I am pretty experienced.
I wanted a restaurant.

164
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,640
Yeah. I know.

165
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,720
I thought that it would be good.

166
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,040
Leaving would be good for me.

167
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,760
When I left, you made fun of me.

168
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,080
You said it was "a shitty country".

169
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,760
- And now you're interested?
- Yeah.

170
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,320
What do you think?

171
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,880
That things will just
fall into your lap?

172
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,760
That all you need
is someone nice to help

173
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,440
and it will all work out?

174
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,040
Are you dreaming?

175
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,880
I don't know if I can trust you.

176
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,760
And my partners...

177
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,040
they are tough.

178
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,760
Tell them that I am too.

179
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,880
You'll also need some dough.

180
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,200
How much?

181
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,360
Well, we all put in 15,000 euros.

182
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:51,760
If I tell them you're a partner,
I need the max now, before I go.

183
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,280
And you have to make
your aliyah.

184
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,200
Ok.

185
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,480
What, "ok"?

186
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,600
- Do you know what it is?
- Yes.

187
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,200
It's like the urge to piss?

188
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,840
Sure, if you say so.

189
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,520
I don't see it.

190
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,080
You're just talking.

191
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,320
But, fine. Just think it through.

192
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,920
It's different over there.

193
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,520
Oh c'mon. I know, Dad.

194
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,480
- Do you speak Hebrew?
- Yeah.

195
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,920
If I say...

196
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,760
If I say, for instance...

197
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,160
You know what I said?

198
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,360
You don't speak Hebrew.

199
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,640
Were you making stuff up?
Yes. Fuck!

200
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,320
Wanna see where it is?

201
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,320
Yeah.

202
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,320
This is Tel Aviv.

203
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,320
And the restaurant is...
See the port?

204
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,680
It's right there,
between the beach and the building.

205
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,160
There.

206
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,960
Gotta run.
A client's waiting for me at Roissy.

207
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,520
What's going on?
Why the sudden rush?

208
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,880
- I need 15,000 euros.
- Woah...

209
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,200
Only with coke you know.

210
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,640
- I know.
- Alright.

211
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,920
Why do you need so much?

212
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,200
A project in Israel with my cousin.

213
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,200
Where they wear tiny crêpes
on their heads?

214
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,200
What will you do there?

215
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,080
They're called kippahs.

216
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,240
So, what?

217
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,800
- You leaving me?
- No. Why?

218
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,840
Cous' will be happy you're dealing
your way to the Holy Land.

219
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,040
Lecture me all year,
but then you want in, huh?

220
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,960
- Can you help? I can't...
- Yes. Hold on.

221
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,200
My cousin will never know.

222
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,760
I'm just in a rush.
That's all.

223
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,360
I'll stop dealing after.

224
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,360
Don't move.

225
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,200
- Thanks.
- Looking good.

226
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,560
Does your brother
know you're leaving?

227
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,960
The less he knows, the better.

228
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,920
He's bad news anyway.

229
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,120
- And you're good news?
- Yes.

230
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,640
I can't take you.
You have your moped.

231
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,680
Sorry, in a rush.
Call me tonight?

232
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,040
I'll call you.

233
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,360
Hello ma'am, where's the mosque?

234
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,520
- I got lost.
- Hi.

235
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,680
- How are you?
- Fine. You?

236
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,040
We didn't get a chance
to chat at Aline's.

237
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,840
- Well, I'm fine.
- Really?

238
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,840
What are you doing here?

239
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,400
I need you.

240
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,760
You said that
before you dumped me.

241
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,640
I need to learn Hebrew.

242
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,840
So it's true, you're going to Israel?

243
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Yes.

244
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,440
You, to Israel?

245
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,080
With Nathan.

246
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,000
But you know that
there are only Jews in Israel?

247
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,200
Really?

248
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,480
- Do you have other Jewish friends?
- Not really.

249
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:10,560
Jews can be a pain,
when there are a lot of them.

250
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,240
Look at our families.
Especially yours.

251
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,200
Stop.

252
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,720
- You've been 15 times.
- I don't want to move.

253
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,040
Well, I do.

254
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,760
Will you help?

255
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,320
No. I don't see why I would.

256
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,880
- You're a saint.
- Don't be blasphemous.

257
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,480
Saturday. 8 o'clock.

258
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,920
"8 o'clock."

259
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,680
In the morning, you moron!

260
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,400
I need to go back.

261
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,200
Thank you.

262
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,520
Ok. You can go.

263
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,200
Spread your arms, please.

264
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,040
Name some Jewish holidays, please?

265
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,480
- Jewish holidays?
- Yes, please.

266
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,080
There is Passover, Hanukkah,
Shabbat...

267
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,080
Ok. Go ahead.
Go through the gate please.

268
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,240
- Goodbye.
- Thanks.

269
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,760
Come with me please.
Hello.

270
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,120
My name is David Meyer,
I am your shaliah.

271
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,920
I am French, Israeli.
I'll be in Paris for 2-3 years,

272
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,320
to help you all with your aliyah.

273
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,360
As you know,
it's also the will of Israel.

274
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,520
We must return to our country,
the country of all Jews.

275
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,600
It's normal to
want change in your life,

276
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,320
to you want to return
to your country.

277
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,360
Look at this portrait.
It's Theodor Herzl.

278
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,480
His big invention was Zionism.

279
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,200
For him, it was the way
to fight anti-Semitism

280
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,360
and the way for Jews
to take charge of their destiny.

281
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,120
Isn't that a grand idea?

282
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,640
But don't go thinking that
the Promised Land is easy,

283
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,800
leaving your French conveniences
for Israel,

284
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,320
where there can be war at any time

285
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:52,640
- some say "all the time" -
is important,

286
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,320
a defining act.

287
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,960
Keep this in mind
every step of the way.

288
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,520
- Does everyone understand?
- Yes.

289
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,320
Good. Let's do questions.

290
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,400
I will hand out a program.

291
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,120
Then, we will begin.

292
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,400
- Here.
- Thanks.

293
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,200
- Are you nervous?
- No.

294
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,800
Just an interview. It's ok.

295
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,360
You're not there yet.

296
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,200
How well do you know Israel?

297
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,800
I went once, as a kid.

298
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,760
Why?

299
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:33,280
It's rare to see applicants
that don't know Israel.

300
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,920
Does it change anything?

301
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,360
You're right. It does not.

302
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,520
So why are you leaving?

303
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:46,920
I can have a job in a restaurant,
doing the renovations.

304
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,920
It's an opportunity.

305
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,960
Leaving without preparing?

306
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,760
I just don't want to be
called for military service.

307
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,560
Only benefits,
no inconveniences. Right?

308
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,960
- How old are you?
- 27.

309
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,640
You won't have to serve.

310
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,200
But if there's a war,

311
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,240
you could be a reservist.
You understand?

312
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,560
What do I need to do?

313
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:18,920
First of all, you need a
Certificate of Jewishness.

314
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,280
The consistory will tell you
what to do.

315
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,200
Fill out the form
and come back to me.

316
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,480
One last thing, Mr. Raphaelson...

317
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,200
No criminal record, right?

318
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,560
No.

319
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,520
If you do, speak up now.

320
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,960
I helped a man who hid
his criminal record from me.

321
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:40,080
Took a plane. Got sent back home
at Ben-Gourion.

322
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,200
He might never be able
to leave again.

323
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,680
No criminal record.

324
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,000
- Wassup?
- All good?

325
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,360
- Hey wassup?
- All good?

326
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,360
- Here for Polo?
- Yeah.

327
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,000
Alex, a friend.

328
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,640
"A friend"?

329
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,440
- Go ahead.
- Let's go.

330
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,360
Go ahead.

331
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:43,400
You remind me of a guy
we called David Pig.

332
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,800
He dealt with us
when we worked in the streets.

333
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,640
If we sold pot, he was there.

334
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,520
And every day, he asked
if he could go out and sell too.

335
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,520
"I want a piece
of the pie too, you guys."

336
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:05,360
We'd tell him to fuck off.
We didn't want no Jew out there.

337
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:11,080
One day, he bought his own joint.
To sell on our street.

338
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,240
We gave him hell.
But he always came back.

339
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,240
Like that, for 1 month.

340
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,800
After 1 month, we saw how
determined he was. No giving up.

341
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,360
So we let him sell.

342
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,280
That's the day we called him
David Pig, isn't it?

343
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,360
Not sure why.
I think the idiot ate pork.

344
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,880
You want 40, right?

345
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,240
- You want 40, right?
- As usual.

346
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,840
Thanks.

347
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,840
Can I taste it?

348
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,640
I'm looking for...

349
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,840
Where is there...?

350
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,920
How can I get to...?

351
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,560
Which bus goes to...?

352
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,320
Could you drive me to..., please.

353
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,800
Where can I buy...?

354
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,760
Go to hell!

355
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:36,280
Listen, he's having problems
with his girlfriend.

356
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,600
He needs time.
He wants to fix the relationship.

357
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,880
He couldn't tell me himself?

358
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:46,040
He thought this would be better,
less hurtful for you.

359
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,600
Do you know what happened
to bearers of bad news

360
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,560
in Ancient times?

361
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:54,520
They'd get burned, asshole.
You and your brother are cowards.

362
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,160
I'll give you a reputation.

363
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,800
He lied. He said that
we'd spend week-ends in Venice.

364
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,120
I never saw one gondola.

365
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,520
He's the one who said
that he'd leave Anaëlle.

366
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,280
He even wrote me poems.
I've never had

367
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,360
a boyfriend write me poems.

368
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,840
It's sad,
but you should stop calling him.

369
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,360
After 2 months, he'll come back.

370
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,480
- You ok?
- Fuck off.

371
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,440
Forget about him. He's bad news.

372
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,040
Poems?
Run, as far as you can.

373
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,840
Jeanne? Jeanne.

374
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,760
- Do you remember me?
- Yes. Of course.

375
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:35,280
It doesn't seem like
a good time to be interrupted.

376
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,160
Oh it's fine.
On the contrary, perfect timing.

377
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,240
No. It's not what you think.

378
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,560
I believe what I see.
Were you making a girl cry?

379
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,840
I don't know that girl.
It's for my brother.

380
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,520
Want to grab some coffee with me?

381
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,480
I don't really like coffee.

382
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,840
Will you come get some with me?

383
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,400
People like you
drink coffee, no?

384
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,920
Who are these "people like me"?

385
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,200
Students.
You're a student, aren't you?

386
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,800
I'll have a beer, if you don't mind.

387
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,720
So you know Esther?

388
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,000
We met in Oriental studies.
I'm learning Japanese.

389
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,080
What will you do with that?

390
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,200
Open a sushi restaurant.

391
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,000
Become a translator.

392
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,240
Do you know that Esther's my ex?

393
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,360
"Ex" what? Exceptional?

394
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:44,280
No. Exasperating.

395
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,440
Since then, what do you do?

396
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,680
Since then?

397
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,160
Business. I'm opening
a restaurant in Israel.

398
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,600
- When?
- Why do you want to know?

399
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,120
I don't need to know.

400
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,080
Thank you.

401
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,840
Thank you.

402
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,480
I like awkward guys.
They're charming.

403
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,560
They're charming?

404
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,880
Well, I think you're charming.

405
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,320
I knew you were pretty,
but now...

406
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,920
Maybe it was too dark.

407
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,560
Maybe I'm just blind.

408
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,720
That's possible too.

409
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,640
I need to take this.
2 minutes. Hold on.

410
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,880
Hold on. Call you back.

411
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,400
Let me out, please.

412
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,760
- How much?
- 150.

413
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,240
Are you Lætitia?

414
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,760
Hi.

415
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,200
I have to get back.
I need to work. No, no.

416
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:38,480
Hi.

417
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,480
Tell me what you did yesterday.
Take your time. Be clear.

418
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,120
Yesterday...

419
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,680
- Remember yesterday?
- I do, I do.

420
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:06,120
I woke up, I smoked a cigarette
while reading the paper...

421
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,960
Say it in Hebrew, idiot.

422
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,000
I can only say
"smoke a cigarette".

423
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,440
Well, say it.

424
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,960
The time? What time is it?

425
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,240
I can't remember how to say
the hours.

426
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,520
No, no. Try to remember.

427
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,600
12.

428
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,840
And the hour...

429
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,560
- Then, I met up with a friend.
- Who?

430
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,280
You won't be happy?

431
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,480
Mathias?

432
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,560
You still see that idiot?

433
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,200
He's my best friend.

434
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,720
- Say it in Hebrew.
- I don't know how.

435
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,360
He never let me down.

436
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,280
You never liked him.

437
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,880
And "demanding"?

438
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,360
You're the most tovanit girl ever.

439
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,480
Demanding with the ones I love.

440
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,640
You don't remember anything.

441
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,200
Here, my elementary level book,
you can practice.

442
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,720
- You're getting married?
- Yes.

443
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,880
At the synagogue, at your parents'?

444
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,480
At his parents' house.

445
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,720
- Do I know him?
- Doubt it.

446
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,600
So, no one knows him.

447
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:07,480
- He's the invisible man.
- He's a Mossad agent.

448
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,440
Mossad.

449
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,320
I see him as fat,
working in import-export.

450
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,360
You're stupid.

451
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,760
He's skinny and teaches biology.

452
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,560
Biology, fascinating!

453
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,520
If you wear a wig, I'll go nuts.

454
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,800
It won't look good.

455
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,280
I'm not marrying a bearded man!

456
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,600
Whatever.

457
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,360
If you go to Israel,
you will see plenty of wigs,

458
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,400
and little nylon tights
even in 120°F...

459
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,240
Not so much in Tel Aviv.

460
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,960
If you need to fight, will you go?

461
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,400
If there's war, will you go?

462
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,280
- No.
- Wait for me. 2 seconds.

463
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,720
Will you kill people,
Palestinians, if you have to?

464
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,200
- For your homeland?
- I said no.

465
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,640
I'm too old for military service.
I won't do it.

466
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,040
I'll just vote left. There.

467
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,800
Whatever works for you.

468
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,520
But, I don't get it.
I thought that we agreed.

469
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,800
When we saw them all leave,

470
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,000
we said that our lives are here,
we are Jews, but Parisian.

471
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,160
We have no business over there.

472
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,560
If you want to leave, go.
But go to Canada or Australia.

473
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,160
Not really into kangaroos.

474
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,160
I don't know why I'm annoyed.

475
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,800
Worst timing ever.
Everyone's back, and you go.

476
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,240
Maybe this country is messed up,
like me.

477
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:47,360
You had everything going for you.
You could have done anything.

478
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:50,360
Instead you're a dealer,
going to Israel.

479
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,800
I don't deal anymore.

480
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,840
But, Esther, look at yourself!

481
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,960
You're a Hebrew teacher,
you're marrying a Jew,

482
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,600
you never lived anywhere else.

483
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,720
What did you free yourself from?

484
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,080
Honestly.

485
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,760
I am very happy, with him.

486
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,440
Good.

487
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,120
- Hello sir.
- Hello.

488
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,160
- Follow me please.
- Yes.

489
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:49,280
- How can I help you?
- I need to see a Rabbi.

490
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,440
Which one? There are several.

491
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,160
I need a Certificate of Jewishness.

492
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,120
Are you an aliyah applicant?

493
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,400
Ask for Rabbi Schulman.
He'll be here next week.

494
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,560
In a rush?

495
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,440
Well, I don't have
my parents' ketubah.

496
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,560
Can you prove that they're Jewish,

497
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,880
with your family record book?

498
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,960
Are their names Jewish?

499
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,080
That's all? They just need
Jewish names?

500
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,920
We can make things
more difficult, if you want.

501
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,200
No, no.

502
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,800
What are their family names?

503
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,400
Katz and Raphaelson.

504
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,440
So, yes. That should be fine then.

505
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,440
Someone's knocking at the door.

506
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,680
And then you say?

507
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,800
- Sorry, I'm late.
- Oh it's ok.

508
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:48,000
I kept some of your mother's boxes.

509
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,360
Come.

510
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,120
I'm sure the family book is there.

511
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,000
Listen, I'll let you go through it.

512
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,640
FAMILY RECORD BOOK

513
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,000
- I found it.
- You're lucky,

514
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,840
I've had no use for it
since your mother's death.

515
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,160
They are curious.

516
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:26,280
Do you remember him?
This is Alex, my son.

517
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:29,240
You met him,
but you were very young.

518
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:32,840
- You can say hi.
- Hi.

519
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,160
Set the table, please.

520
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,800
Will you stay?
We don't have enough but...

521
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,400
No, no. I can't.

522
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,320
I'm going to Israel.

523
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,720
Really?

524
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,000
Do you know Israel?

525
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,160
No.

526
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,560
What will you do?

527
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,520
Work with Nathan.

528
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,320
You will work?
That's a nice change.

529
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,240
And your brother?

530
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,320
How will he do without you?
What will he do?

531
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:14,160
- He doesn't know.
- Oh, of course.

532
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,160
If he knew, he would stop you.

533
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,600
He thinks you owe him everything.

534
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,320
Back then, he said that he was
like your real dad, no?

535
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:25,600
Want to know how he is?

536
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:27,240
No.

537
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,040
And Gabriel?

538
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,000
- How is he?
- 5th grade,

539
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,520
good student.
- Good.

540
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,840
Do you need anything else?

541
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:43,040
5,000 euros. Do you have that?

542
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,840
Well I'm doing this.
I won't walk you out.

543
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:53,000
Have a safe trip.

544
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,440
And stay in touch.

545
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:02,120
Ciao!

546
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,840
Who is it?

547
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,680
Jeanne. I'm early,
I was in the neighborhood.

548
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,680
- Can you open?
- Coming.

549
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,320
Coming.

550
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:45,040
Ok!

551
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,760
- Well...
- How are you?

552
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:49,760
Fine.

553
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,200
So, this is your cave?

554
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:05,440
- May I?
- Sure.

555
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:23,600
- Do you deal drugs?
- What?

556
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,280
I know you do.

557
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,560
No. I don't.

558
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,880
It's ok. I like the fact
that you try to hide it.

559
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,160
But I don't deal.

560
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,920
- Is that you?
- Yeah.

561
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:51,320
"Conversation kit. Hebrew."

562
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,000
- So it's happening?
- Yes.

563
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,760
"Israel, find happiness
and serenity."

564
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,360
"Israel, one trip,
a lifetime of happiness."

565
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:18,160
"3 steps to get your
Certificate of Jewishness." So?

566
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:20,880
What?

567
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:23,080
So you're officially Jewish?

568
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:24,640
Working on it.

569
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,440
Do you have family in Israel?

570
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:35,040
- My cousin.
- And...?

571
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:37,280
And that's all.

572
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,600
This is kind of an adventure.

573
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,200
"Ticket receipt, one way trip."

574
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,920
- They don't give a return?
- No.

575
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:54,880
- What did you think?
- Nothing.

576
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:56,760
You're leaving.

577
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:15,320
Wait, wait.

578
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,480
Is it God you're looking for?

579
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:04,160
No.

580
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:07,760
I'm going because...

581
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:10,440
no one is asking me to stay.

582
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,600
Even my father isn't asking me to.

583
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,920
Actually, he doesn't give a shit.

584
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:22,800
What if I asked you?

585
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,320
Stay.

586
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:32,640
Go ahead. Take it.

587
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,080
He was never good at soccer.

588
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:48,040
Isaac!

589
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:56,520
Do you see who's here?
Come on, let's go tell them.

590
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,160
Well, you came,

591
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:02,320
- accompanied.
- This is Jeanne.

592
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,360
- Hello.
- Hello, Jeanne.

593
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:08,240
We have some big news.
I asked Anaëlle to marry me!

594
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,920
- Do you want to know how?
- No.

595
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:13,360
I got down on one knee.

596
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,200
I gave her a ring.

597
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,640
I said: "Anaëlle, I love you.
Be my wife."

598
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,640
And you know what? She said yes!

599
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,880
Show them.
They don't believe us.

600
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:29,040
Will you be our best man?

601
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:31,760
We'd be honored.

602
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,320
- Come, time for champagne.
- Come.

603
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:47,680
Do you want some more?

604
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:49,200
I'd love some.

605
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:54,840
Thanks.

606
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,840
How long have you and Alex
been together?

607
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:00,800
You're nosy!

608
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:05,080
It's just that I don't know much
about my brother's love life.

609
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:09,040
I'm not sure we're technically
in a relationship.

610
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:12,200
If he brought you here, then you are.

611
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:13,680
He hates introducing me.

612
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,200
Why?
You're irresistible?

613
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,640
More like the shame of the family.

614
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,200
Ugly little duckling.

615
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:24,040
So meeting the ugly duckling
is a good thing?

616
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:25,040
Yeah, why not?

617
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,920
I think I have no way of
holding him back.

618
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,120
- In any case, he's leaving.
- Where to?

619
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:34,360
To Israel.

620
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:35,960
Tel Aviv.

621
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:38,480
You didn't know?

622
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,040
And you're not going?

623
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:46,920
Why?

624
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:53,040
I wouldn't worry too much.

625
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:56,120
He's very indecisive.

626
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,120
You'll see. He won't go.

627
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:11,640
Ask them to wait for me.
No. Don't have them wait for me.

628
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,520
- What exactly did you need?
- 40.

629
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,240
You've been doing well lately.

630
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:33,760
Not bad.

631
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:38,280
Baby, my earrings?

632
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:40,840
Check the bathroom.

633
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:49,360
Here you go. Be belek.
Hide it well.

634
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,640
Ok. Can I trust you?

635
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:13,360
Isaac. Are you ok?

636
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,200
What have you done?
Come.

637
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:35,080
Oh, fuck. That stuff burns.

638
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:36,680
Don't you have normal stuff?

639
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:37,800
Look at me.

640
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:40,920
Where were you?

641
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:43,280
Here and there.
Looking for dough.

642
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:45,560
And...?

643
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:49,560
I saw the guys from Sarcelles.
Four of them cornered me.

644
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:52,360
It will get worse,
if I don't pay back now.

645
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,360
How much do you owe?

646
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:58,560
Four. Four grand.

647
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:04,440
I can't give it to you.
I need it.

648
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:05,560
What for?

649
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:08,800
To live, asshole. I don't know.

650
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:10,240
"To live."

651
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:17,160
Can I stay here for 2-3 days
while this heals?

652
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:19,160
I don't want Ana to see me.

653
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,880
What will you tell her?

654
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:25,360
Anything.
That I went to Bordeaux.

655
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:30,000
- You think she'll believe it?
- She can't see me.

656
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:35,520
- You really need the cash?
- Yes.

657
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:38,360
What for?

658
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:40,200
You have plans, right?

659
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:42,080
Big plans?

660
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:43,960
Sir Alex has a master plan?

661
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:46,640
Ah, I see...

662
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:49,640
Oh, fuck!

663
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,200
I want to shoot myself.

664
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:57,400
I'm going to get a gun,
put it here and shoot.

665
00:55:58,600 --> 00:55:59,800
Like that.

666
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:20,960
Yeah. Ana?

667
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:24,680
Yes. It's me.
I need to go back to Bordeaux.

668
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:27,800
Meeting a guy
who's buying some watches.

669
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:30,040
2 days tops.

670
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,080
Then, I won't go anywhere. Promise.

671
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:34,480
No, no. I'm fine. Don't worry.

672
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:36,800
Yeah. Me too, yeah.

673
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:38,840
I'll call you tonight.

674
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:48,320
I'll do 2,000, but I'm coming too.

675
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,560
They are bastards. Stay out of this.

676
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:52,520
Just giving the money.

677
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:55,080
Take this, but I'm coming
with you. Got it?

678
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,800
- What are you doing?
- Coming with you.

679
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,240
Ok. You came.

680
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:10,920
What more do you want?

681
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:14,360
If I'm not back in 10mn,
come and find me on the 3rd floor.

682
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:54,240
Are you sleeping?

683
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:57,000
- You good?
- Yes. Thanks so much.

684
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,800
- You're saying thanks?
- Yeah why?

685
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:01,480
When it suits you, right?

686
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:05,200
Or it's "I need dough.
I'm in trouble. I'm getting married."

687
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,360
For the marriage,
I did not ask for help.

688
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:10,200
I just had to make your
pharmacist cry.

689
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,640
It's normal.
You're my little brother.

690
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:13,920
That makes you laugh?

691
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:20,000
You know what,
I'd like to go to Mom's grave.

692
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:22,960
- Right now?
- Yeah.

693
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,960
- Esther's getting married.
- I know.

694
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:32,640
- How do you know?
- I see her sometimes.

695
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:34,240
Meaning?

696
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,080
- What?
- Are you guys fornicating?

697
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:40,560
What a choice of words!

698
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:43,720
- Thanks. Do you know what it means?
- Yes.

699
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:47,240
- Are you guys fornicating or not?
- No. It's over.

700
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:49,120
You were crazy about her.

701
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:52,280
Remember jumping
in the 2 inch pond at camp?

702
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:55,360
- Desperate.
- I was trying to commit suicide.

703
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:57,080
I don't believe you!

704
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,720
You're actually a romantic.

705
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:01,000
Maybe even more than I am.

706
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:03,560
And Jeanne?

707
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:05,640
What about Jeanne?

708
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:06,920
Do you love her?

709
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,440
You and your crazy choice of words!

710
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:12,280
- It's simple.
- No, it's not.

711
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:14,640
- Love her. Don't love her?
- No.

712
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:16,920
- She loves you.
- Really?

713
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:17,840
Oh yeah.

714
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:23,800
You're actually a heartbreaker.
That's your problem.

715
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:25,360
I'm not like you.

716
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:28,800
I've had more girlfriends
than you think.

717
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Sure, but not decent ones.

718
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,840
What? You don't think
that Anaëlle is pretty?

719
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,240
She's okay, yes.

720
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:38,400
- So?
- But isn't she nearly blind?

721
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:41,640
You're jealous.

722
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:46,160
It's crazy. I just realized,
just this second,

723
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:48,800
that you are jealous of me.
How crazy.

724
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,280
My son is good-looking.
You can't say no.

725
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:52,640
He's very good-looking.

726
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:19,000
Rose Raphaelson born Katz

727
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:42,040
- Hey man. Come on in.
- How are you?

728
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:46,840
As usual?

729
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:53,240
Your buddy Mathias is here.

730
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:55,560
- Mathias is here?
- Yeah, come in.

731
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:04,960
What's up, buddy?

732
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:06,040
What's up?

733
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:08,720
Take a good look at this guy
because

734
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:11,680
he's my best friend
and I'd do anything for him.

735
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:13,880
Do you know that?

736
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:16,680
And he is very clever.

737
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:19,440
He's as clever as a fox.

738
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:22,520
He'll watch over our families
when we're in jail.

739
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,480
You won't let me down, right?

740
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,760
- You won't let me down?
- No. Let's talk.

741
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:33,120
Wait. Listen to me, buddy.

742
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:35,680
You have to listen to me.

743
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:38,160
You have to listen to me.

744
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:40,520
You're my brother,

745
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:43,880
and I'm your brother.

746
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:48,400
We'll go to Rotterdam,
buy some stuff, make lots of money.

747
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:51,560
- No.
- Tomorrow night. You and I.

748
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:53,320
We'll go to Rotterdam.

749
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:56,760
We'll load it in the trunk.
We'll do it overnight.

750
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,720
It's what you wanted, no?
Big and quick, right?

751
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:03,400
- That's not it.
- I planned everything.

752
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:07,200
Lucie is coming. We're 3
business students visiting Holland.

753
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:10,880
I'll take a car from the garage.
I planned everything.

754
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:14,040
It won't work, Mathias.

755
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:23,320
That guy's only fucking goal in life

756
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:26,680
is to open a crêpe stand in Israel.

757
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,240
- Fuck off, little league.
- Calm down.

758
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:37,160
Come on, fuck off.

759
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:38,640
Calm down, I said.

760
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:58,120
I have the cash.

761
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:08,200
You know what, Isaac?
You're nothing. Nothing at all.

762
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:41,840
Oh, fuck!

763
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:39,800
Relax, will you?

764
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,800
If customs sees your pathetic face,
we're screwed.

765
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:47,640
You ok, in the back there, Lucie?
All good?

766
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:53,640
- Talk. What's going on?
- Nothing. It's fine. Drive.

767
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:15,520
I'll be quick.

768
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:25,200
Thanks.

769
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:41,880
I need you to listen carefully.
I've never been this serious.

770
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:47,360
I'm going to meet Lucie
at the coffee machine.

771
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:49,040
I'll go quickly.

772
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:52,520
I'll leave the keys in the ignition.

773
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:56,560
Once inside, I'll take my time.

774
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:59,920
I might chat with her,
negotiate a kiss.

775
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:01,400
Or 2.

776
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:07,040
And you, during this time,
you will take a deep breath...

777
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,280
slap yourself in the face,
like you do to wake up...

778
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:17,720
look at the cash.
And remember that you need it.

779
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:22,560
It would be stupid to get arrested.
You can't screw it all up.

780
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:28,000
So, you will start the car...

781
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:32,560
think about your
awesome friend Mathias.

782
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:37,720
And get back on the road to Paris.

783
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:41,320
Understood?

784
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:45,120
You can't do that. There's Polo.

785
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:48,640
I'll say that I didn't see it coming.

786
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:52,720
Lucie can be our witness,
and if he flips out,

787
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:55,640
I'll pay him back.
I'll do the trip again.

788
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:00,640
And you can pay me back
from your kosher crêpes.

789
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:09,760
I can come with you guys.

790
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:12,040
But I don't want that.

791
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:16,960
I'm doing this for me.
Do you understand?

792
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:18,280
I need it.

793
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:27,000
And you, you need to leave Isaac.

794
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:50,120
I'll take this.
You know... for the ride back.

795
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:57,560
May I?

796
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:02,800
Here.

797
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,640
It's my father's stuff.

798
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:07,880
Boxers, socks, a sweater, jeans.

799
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:10,160
- What you wanted.
- Thanks.

800
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:22,280
- So you're flying out tonight?
- Yes.

801
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:25,280
I land in Tel Aviv tomorrow at 4.

802
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:29,960
Ok. Well that gives me enough time
to share a story.

803
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:31,040
You interested?

804
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:34,760
For the road.

805
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:45,520
I'll be J.
And you'll be A.

806
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:48,440
J loves A.

807
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:51,560
But...

808
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:56,000
A is more complicated
than you'd think,

809
01:12:56,160 --> 01:13:00,120
which means that J, who loves drama,

810
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:02,080
loves him even more.

811
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:04,600
A, on the other hand...

812
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:07,040
- You following?
- Yes.

813
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:11,600
...is still dealing with
what we will call EP,

814
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:13,400
for "existential problem".

815
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:18,360
And that attracts J even more.

816
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:20,880
Even though she hates to admit it.

817
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:24,320
But he has a brother,

818
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:26,720
I,

819
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:31,240
who ruins his life.

820
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:39,000
And he also has an ex, E...

821
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:42,000
who he loved very much.

822
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:00,120
So, let's recap.

823
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:05,920
A is surrounded by I, E and EP.

824
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:12,280
And J would like to have
a spot of her own.

825
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:13,400
You see?

826
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:16,440
She would like to break
all of these other bonds

827
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:17,960
because J is special.

828
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:20,560
And on top of it, A knows it.

829
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:23,240
The problem is that since A

830
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:27,440
thinks that he will be able
to find peace in Israel,

831
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:32,560
this relationship between J and A

832
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:35,280
is impossible.

833
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:40,480
Well, I think that A loves J.

834
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:44,120
As soon as he does
something good in his life,

835
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:47,280
he will let himself be loved.

836
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:54,200
A will think about the times
that he slept with J

837
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:57,400
because J is good in bed,
despite falling asleep so fast.

838
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:00,880
That's true. J is very good in bed.

839
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:02,880
Meanwhile,

840
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:08,680
J will miss A's cock, even if
it does not wear a little hat.

841
01:23:58,120 --> 01:24:01,200
Subtitling: Eclair Group

842
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:54,360
The trip to Paris

843
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:55,880
Who do you think you are?

844
01:25:56,040 --> 01:25:57,320
Are you serious?

845
01:25:57,520 --> 01:26:00,160
You're the one
who's late every day.

846
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:01,920
You have proof?

847
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:05,400
What proof? This is not
a courthouse, this is work.

848
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:08,440
They drink coffee and smoke
and you say nothing.

849
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:11,840
If I had something to tell them,
I would.

850
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:13,760
This is about you.

851
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:19,880
Julie is passionate, as usual.

852
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:22,160
Mourad, you're perfect.

853
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:24,160
Let's move on.

854
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:28,880
Amina and Momo, get ready.

855
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:32,760
The new theme is love.

856
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:36,560
Take your time
and listen to each other.

857
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:42,920
What are you doing?

858
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:44,320
Stop it.

859
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:47,320
-Jérôme, you have a problem?
-No.

860
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:50,480
He's taking the piss,
he's not used to taking notes.

861
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:51,840
Knock it off.

862
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:55,760
I'm writing scene 6 for him,
he'll be a virgin.

863
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:58,600
Let it go now.

864
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:01,640
You're supposed to write at home,
not here.

865
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:04,480
I can't. Nothing comes.

866
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:07,080
-What do you mean?
-I have no inspiration.

867
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:09,160
You can't just wait for it.

868
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:12,320
Take the time to write
and think about it.

869
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:16,040
Me too, I try but I can't.
I only have one character.

870
01:27:16,160 --> 01:27:17,320
It doesn't matter.

871
01:27:17,480 --> 01:27:20,480
What's important
is to use your own words.

872
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:23,880
Who's coming
to the workshop tonight?

873
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:30,360
This great author
wants to work with youngsters.

874
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:32,040
-What time?
-7pm.

875
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:34,920
-I have dance lesson.
-I have class.

876
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:37,320
-And A-levels.
-You're taking it now?

877
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:39,920
Yeah, right. You're like 40.

878
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:41,760
It's a BTEC.

879
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:43,880
-Where?
-In the 5th arrondissement.

880
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:45,920
-Where is that?
-Saint-Michel.

881
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:48,480
Near Les Halles.

882
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:50,600
It is a big workshop.

883
01:27:53,320 --> 01:27:55,440
Are you coming over
to watch the game?

884
01:27:55,560 --> 01:27:58,160
I'm going to this writing thing.

885
01:27:58,280 --> 01:28:00,360
Paris will give me ideas.

886
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:02,280
What? Are you serious?

887
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:04,320
I dig that.

888
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:06,600
Sitting by the river

889
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:08,480
inspires me.

890
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:12,360
-You're not watching the game?
-I don't give a shit.

891
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:14,240
What is this thing?

892
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:15,520
It's for bohos.

893
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:18,040
You suck,
you don't know anything.

894
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:20,320
I'm talking about
the real Paris.

895
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:25,360
Girls in skirts,
bars, restaurants.

896
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:28,240
If you could see their bakeries.

897
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:31,800
When you take a bite,
you don't lose your bloody teeth.

898
01:28:31,960 --> 01:28:33,880
It's gonna suck.

899
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,480
You'll be bored to death

900
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:39,640
and end up reading mangas
with some guys in Virgin.

901
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:42,040
OK, forget it.

902
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:52,800
-I'm off.
-You're not going home?

903
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,640
-I have something to do.
-Laters.

904
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:23,160
How are you doing?

905
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:34,240
-What's up?
-Hey, vampire face.

906
01:29:36,920 --> 01:29:39,080
All good, bud?

907
01:29:40,680 --> 01:29:41,880
Hey, Mourad.

908
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,600
Do you know what we're up to?

909
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:47,920
-You're sitting on your asses.
-No, we're lounging.

910
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:50,160
He learned a new word,
he's high now.

911
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:53,680
-I'm in a hurry.
-Chill out, man.

912
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:55,960
-I'm off.
-It's been a while.

913
01:29:56,160 --> 01:29:59,200
-Where to?
-Something in Paris.

914
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:01,760
-To see a chick.
-Where did you get that?

915
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:04,400
You're going to Paris
without your buddies?

916
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:07,200
Seriously,
you know the game is tonight.

917
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:08,920
It's cooked.

918
01:30:09,080 --> 01:30:11,040
-What?
-I'm not coming.

919
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:13,360
Why?
We haven't seen you in ages.

920
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:15,600
Stay with us, bud.

921
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:17,240
Come back.

922
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:19,960
-You've changed.
-Your mum is looking for you.

923
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:22,400
Your mum is looking for me.

924
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:24,640
Don't turn your back on us.

925
01:30:24,760 --> 01:30:28,600
-I'm sure he's in love.
-He's going down.

926
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:32,880
He stopped eating pasta
and he was mad about it.

927
01:30:45,160 --> 01:30:46,600
All good, brother?

928
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:48,800
Listen to this, it's mental.

929
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:53,400
A famous writer wants to work
with suburb kids like me.

930
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:56,040
I'm going to
his writing workshop tonight.

931
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:59,640
He's gonna be mad
about my stuff.

932
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:04,880
I'll tell you about it
when I come back, OK?

933
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,720
See you, bro.

934
01:31:18,040 --> 01:31:19,920
-You're here?
-I live here.

935
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:21,840
Show some respect.

936
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:23,400
Move.

937
01:31:44,360 --> 01:31:45,960
Get dressed.

938
01:31:46,120 --> 01:31:47,480
Mourad?

939
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:52,400
What?

940
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:55,360
-What are you doing?
-Having a shower obviously.

941
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:58,960
-At that time?
-There's a time now?

942
01:31:59,160 --> 01:32:02,560
-I need you.
-Wait a second, I can't hear you.

943
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:07,480
What's wrong?

944
01:32:07,640 --> 01:32:11,320
You get in without saying hi
and shower at that time.

945
01:32:11,480 --> 01:32:12,480
It's rude.

946
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:14,960
Are you kidding?
You're driving me mad.

947
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:19,200
You shower in the morning
or before going to bed, not now.

948
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:22,120
-What is this for?
-Auntie Zora's wedding.

949
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:23,960
You're stressing me for that?

950
01:32:24,160 --> 01:32:27,000
We have to put this in the car
and leave.

951
01:32:27,200 --> 01:32:30,000
-Uncle Hassan said...
-What, leave?

952
01:32:30,160 --> 01:32:32,200
We're all going as a family.

953
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:33,360
No way.

954
01:32:33,480 --> 01:32:36,520
Auntie Zora is getting married
each year.

955
01:32:36,680 --> 01:32:38,080
You're coming, period.

956
01:32:38,240 --> 01:32:39,480
I have things to do.

957
01:32:39,680 --> 01:32:42,520
Exactly, you have to come
to a family wedding.

958
01:32:42,680 --> 01:32:45,920
-You should have told me.
-I did but you never listen.

959
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:48,480
You told me a year ago
when I was asleep?

960
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:52,520
-You never told me about it.
-Why do you moan all the time?

961
01:32:52,680 --> 01:32:56,120
I don't like Arabic weddings,
I told you a hundred times.

962
01:32:56,240 --> 01:32:59,160
You prefer Italian
or Chinese weddings?

963
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:01,960
Arabic weddings
are all the same.

964
01:33:02,120 --> 01:33:05,000
The same tune is on repeat

965
01:33:05,160 --> 01:33:08,240
and the bloody couscous is gross.

966
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:11,240
It's full of hypocrites I hate.

967
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:14,480
-You do it for your aunt.
-It's always last minute.

968
01:33:14,680 --> 01:33:16,640
-When and where?
-8.30pm.

969
01:33:16,760 --> 01:33:19,280
-In Beauvais.
-60km away?

970
01:33:19,480 --> 01:33:22,640
Forget it, Mum.
I'll meet you there.

971
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:25,240
Out of the question,
you're coming with us.

972
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:27,920
-I never ask you anything.
-Nasser will drive you.

973
01:33:28,080 --> 01:33:30,200
Nasser is my nephew,
not my son.

974
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:33,640
People will notice.
How embarrassing.

975
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:35,960
Get out of the way.

976
01:33:40,920 --> 01:33:43,200
-What are you doing?
-Not your business.

977
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:48,160
-Where is my bag?
-I don't know.

978
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:50,080
I left it there.

979
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:51,920
Well, I'm here.

980
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:55,080
-You're sitting on it, idiot.
-Mum!
