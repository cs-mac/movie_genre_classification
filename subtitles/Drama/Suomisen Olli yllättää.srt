1
00:00:50,051 --> 00:00:56,766
THE HAPPIEST DAY
IN THE LIFE OF OLLI MAKI

2
00:00:59,852 --> 00:01:03,189
Use the choke.
It's the knob between the seats.

3
00:01:04,273 --> 00:01:08,319
Give it a little gas.
Can you reach?

4
00:01:11,781 --> 00:01:16,494
Let's try something different.
Maybe this will work.

5
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:22,333
Everything's all right.
Let me take you out.

6
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:24,335
Thank you.

7
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:29,715
Don't get upset now.
Where are your parents?

8
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:34,405
Hi.

9
00:02:34,864 --> 00:02:36,574
You must be Olli.
- Yes.

10
00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:39,952
Where's Raija?
- She's inside.

11
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:41,787
Right.

12
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:47,418
Hello.
- Oh hello.

13
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:50,963
Oh hello.
- Hi.

14
00:02:51,714 --> 00:02:54,467
Going somewhere?
- To the wedding.

15
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:56,510
What wedding?

16
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,519
What wedding?

17
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:10,816
Are you going dressed like that?
- I don't know.

18
00:03:16,447 --> 00:03:20,034
Are they big?
- Yeah, a little in the front.

19
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:23,120
Let me put newspaper in them.

20
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:28,584
I heard your manager
is so full of himself -

21
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:31,545
that he put you
in the featherweight class -

22
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,590
because he didn't want you
in the same class -

23
00:03:34,757 --> 00:03:37,092
he used to box in.
- Elis is a good guy.

24
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:41,680
Are you riding with us?
- No, in Olli's car. - Yes.

25
00:03:45,518 --> 00:03:47,394
Use the choke.

26
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:56,028
It won't start.
- Try again.

27
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:01,867
Can you manage?

28
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:24,348
"If I speak in the tongues of men
or of angels, -

29
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,684
but do not have love..."

30
00:04:26,851 --> 00:04:30,020
I heard they put you
in the bantam weight class.

31
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:32,565
No, I'm in the featherweight class.

32
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:36,902
Featherweight? Are they
lighter than bantam weight?

33
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:40,030
No, they're heavier. 57 kilos.

34
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:43,075
How much do you weigh now?
- What?

35
00:04:43,242 --> 00:04:46,745
How much do you weigh now?
- A little over 60.

36
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:50,791
Isn't there a class between them?
- Bantam would be.

37
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,794
No, lightweight is between them.

38
00:04:54,420 --> 00:05:00,759
How much do the bantams weigh?
- 53.5. They're very light.

39
00:05:02,428 --> 00:05:05,639
Feathers are heavier than bantams?
Makes no sense.

40
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:10,644
Why aren't you competing in
the lightweight class? - Well...

41
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:13,147
Be quiet, kids.

42
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,692
Good luck.

43
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:20,946
"...faith, hope and love.
But the greatest of these is love."

44
00:05:56,732 --> 00:06:05,866
<i>Youth is the happiest time,
a truly blessed thing</i>

45
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:16,043
<i>Filled with joy and longing
in a seemingly endless spring</i>

46
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:28,430
What are you doing?
- Trying to catch the fly.

47
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,854
Drink the milk up so we can
catch the fly with the glass.

48
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:38,649
Good job. Can I please have it?

49
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:40,901
Thank you.

50
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:56,333
What are we going to do with it?
- Let's kill it.

51
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:59,128
Let's release it.
- Let's eat it.

52
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:01,130
Shall we release it?
- Yes.

53
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:03,549
Let's eat it.
- It's gone.

54
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:08,178
Here you are.

55
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:40,169
Hi.

56
00:07:53,891 --> 00:08:01,065
Yes. Dear guests
and the bride and groom.

57
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:06,153
I remember when you, Tuula,
were born.

58
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,448
It was a beautiful spring morning.

59
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:11,658
Love seems to be a serious thing.

60
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:17,206
The sun was shining,
and it was a bit cloudy.

61
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,875
It wasn't raining.

62
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:19,226
Olli. Olli, look.

63
00:10:04,188 --> 00:10:07,482
All right.
The world champion has arrived.

64
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:13,071
Put your bags in here. Hi.

65
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:16,158
This is Raija.
- Hello. I'm Elis.

66
00:10:16,325 --> 00:10:17,951
Did the trip go well?
- Yes.

67
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,204
Good. Please step in the car.

68
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,997
There's a boxing boom now.

69
00:10:22,164 --> 00:10:24,917
Some people have been
asking me about the match.

70
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,544
That's good.
They'll come to the match.

71
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:30,839
I've been sparring
in the outdoor dance pavilion.

72
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:34,259
Outside? - Yeah, because
the match will be outside.

73
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:38,972
Damn good, as we'll be practicing
at the outdoor swimming pool.

74
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:43,310
Who are these people in the photos?
- That's Rocky Marciano.

75
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:47,064
Sure you know him?
One of the greatest.

76
00:10:47,231 --> 00:10:51,902
He's got his own restaurant now.
Excellent food. We ate there.

77
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,779
You know who that is?
- No.

78
00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:58,492
You have to know.
Sure you know. It's Frankie.

79
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:02,037
Frankie boy. Frank Sinatra.

80
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:06,291
We're friends. I took the photo.
- Right. That's something.

81
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:09,795
Who made this?
- Olli, you know what it is?

82
00:11:09,962 --> 00:11:13,340
That's you when you won
the European Championship? - Yes.

83
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:15,425
I won the gold in 1951.

84
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:17,719
I fought Pierre MontanÃ© and won.

85
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:19,972
I knocked him out
in the last round.

86
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:22,266
That was the best day of my life.

87
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,604
Oh, it's Laila and the kids.

88
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:32,401
Hi.
The guests have arrived already.

89
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:35,320
Hi.
- This is Raija.

90
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:37,531
Take the sweater off.

91
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:39,449
Hi, I'm Raija.
- Hi.

92
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:41,660
Could you make the beds for them?

93
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:45,622
Will you be staying here or
somewhere else? - I'll stay here.

94
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:49,251
All right. Please make the beds
for them in the kids' room.

95
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:51,044
Why there?

96
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:55,966
I wasn't expecting
him to bring anyone.

97
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:58,927
Make the beds in the kids' room,
all right?

98
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:05,017
I'll show you the way.
Not that there's much to show.

99
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:10,230
Hi.
- Hi. Is this your room?

100
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:13,150
Yes.
- Now you have to be evacuated.

101
00:12:13,317 --> 00:12:15,027
That's okay.

102
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:18,530
Which one of you will sleep here?
- Me.

103
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:23,327
Wow. - Okay, let's let
our guests settle in here.

104
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:27,205
C'mon, kids. Go on.

105
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:29,082
Come see us later.

106
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,425
Is it sturdy enough
for your weight? - C'mon!

107
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:40,427
Who's the fatso here?

108
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,561
Welcome, everyone.
- Thank you.

109
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:52,856
Please be seated.

110
00:12:53,357 --> 00:12:59,654
If you run out of seats, you can
stand by the door or back wall.

111
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:02,699
I'm sure there's room for everyone.

112
00:13:03,075 --> 00:13:06,787
Why don't we get started
little by little.

113
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:09,581
Thank you for coming.

114
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:14,127
Can you make room for me?
Could you move a little?

115
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:18,840
All right.

116
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:24,846
On August 17th, we'll make
Finnish sports history.

117
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:28,308
That's when Olli Maki,
"The Baker of Kokkola," -

118
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:32,854
will meet Davey Moore,
the current world champion.

119
00:13:33,397 --> 00:13:35,774
The night is organized
by Askin Talli.

120
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:38,402
We promise you
it'll be a spectacle -

121
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:41,321
like none other
you've ever seen in Finland.

122
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:44,866
No one has even dared
to dream about something like this.

123
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:48,495
You don't have to go all the way
to America to see a great show.

124
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:50,497
We're bringing America here.

125
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:54,292
This is your first time competing
in the featherweight class.

126
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:57,254
How do you think
it'll affect your performance?

127
00:13:57,587 --> 00:14:02,592
Well... I'll be a little lighter...

128
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:06,263
But so will my opponent.

129
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:09,433
I don't know.
I guess it won't be that different.

130
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:13,270
I'm Reijo Pahkamaki from
Keskipohjanmaa newspaper.

131
00:14:13,437 --> 00:14:17,816
Is Olli under 57 kilos
at the moment? - Of course not.

132
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:20,318
We have over two weeks
until the match.

133
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:24,281
Losing weight is
a normal thing for boxers.

134
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:26,074
Unlike for some.

135
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:29,411
This will be
the most important match -

136
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:31,538
in Olli's professional career.

137
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:34,958
We'll do our best to bring
the title home to Finland.

138
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:39,838
The other competitors will be...

139
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:43,175
That's it. Move your feet.
Keep your hands up.

140
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:47,971
Harder. Harder.
That's it. Good job.

141
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,348
Use your lead hand. Harder! Good!

142
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:53,143
Keep your hands up.
Move your feet.

143
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,520
Hands up. Good!

144
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:58,106
Break! Elis!
- Olli, stop.

145
00:14:58,273 --> 00:14:59,900
I can't do this anymore.

146
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:02,402
Really good job.

147
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:11,912
Let's continue.

148
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:17,709
Okay.

149
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:27,093
Good job, Olli!

150
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,056
Good. That's it.

151
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,017
Good. Hit.

152
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:37,354
Good. All right.

153
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:48,657
Don't hit an old man.
Excellent job. Excellent.

154
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:57,582
Holy shit, Olli.
It's looking great.

155
00:15:57,749 --> 00:16:00,669
This is going to be something.
You get it?

156
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:02,879
Good job. Keep up the good work.

157
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:06,633
Good job, Olli.

158
00:16:29,573 --> 00:16:34,661
Hey, guys!
Guys, listen. Oh my God.

159
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:39,583
I'd like to introduce you
to two gentlemen.

160
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:43,712
These guys are going to make
a documentary about our event.

161
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,549
They'll film you intensely.
Everybody will be in the film.

162
00:16:47,716 --> 00:16:49,884
Me too?
- Everybody.

163
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:53,555
First and foremost we'll
concentrate on Olli's journey -

164
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:56,766
to becoming the world champion
and a national hero.

165
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:58,560
No stress.

166
00:16:59,311 --> 00:17:04,357
We'll try to stay out of your way
and just film you training.

167
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:06,776
Luukkonen.

168
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:09,321
Hi.
- Hello.

169
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:14,284
We're in a bit of a hurry,
so why don't we continue later.

170
00:17:14,743 --> 00:17:16,411
Good.
- See you.

171
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:19,080
Good. Thank you.

172
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,883
Does this have a name?
- What?

173
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:32,344
Does your buddy have a name?

174
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:36,264
Elis, can you help me
with the tie?

175
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,894
Can someone tie his tie?

176
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:44,105
Put the tie on him.

177
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:48,360
We're ready. Please step
in front of the camera.

178
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:50,528
Let's go, GUYS-

179
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:56,576
All right then.

180
00:17:58,161 --> 00:17:59,829
Tighten it a bit. Good.

181
00:18:00,872 --> 00:18:05,752
Okay. Then just a hint of a smile.

182
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:08,672
Look in the camera.

183
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:14,010
Okay, try to concentrate now.
- All right.

184
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:19,516
Smile a little and...

185
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:26,022
Everybody focus now.

186
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:29,275
Here we go. Look in the camera.

187
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:34,072
And another one.

188
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,907
Good. Thank you.

189
00:18:38,243 --> 00:18:41,162
Then we'll take
a photo of Olli and Sirpa together.

190
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:43,665
You don't need me anymore?
- No.

191
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:46,126
Okay. Good.

192
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:51,297
Hi.

193
00:18:54,217 --> 00:18:56,928
Saara, do we have a stool?

194
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:04,185
Which one?
- Take the red one.

195
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:13,111
I should get on this?

196
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:15,864
Here?
- Yes.

197
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:18,283
Will it hold?
- Oh yes.

198
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:23,413
Looking good.

199
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:28,752
Olli, don't be shy.
Put your arms around her.

200
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:31,421
Olli, I'll wait for you outside.

201
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:36,092
Good. Look into the camera.

202
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,057
Perfect. Good job, guys.

203
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:47,312
Olli and I have an important dinner
with a sponsor.

204
00:19:47,562 --> 00:19:49,773
You can walk back to my place.
- Yeah.

205
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:52,942
Will you be all right?
We won't be long.

206
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:55,945
I'll probably get lost
in the first park. - Right.

207
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,574
Don't take the suit off.

208
00:19:59,783 --> 00:20:01,618
I'll see you later, guys!

209
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:19,803
Here.

210
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,597
This one?
- Yeah.

211
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:41,574
That's a lot of silverware.
- A bit too much.

212
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,495
C'mon. We have a good deal
with this place.

213
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:48,289
We can eat here
as often as we like.

214
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:50,458
Of course
you can't eat that much, -

215
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,460
but we can bring sponsors here.

216
00:20:52,627 --> 00:20:55,880
We only have to take a couple
of photos with them. - Right.

217
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,384
Here he comes.
Stay calm and cool.

218
00:20:59,968 --> 00:21:01,594
Oh.
- Hello.

219
00:21:01,803 --> 00:21:04,764
Hello. Olli Maki.
- Hello.

220
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:08,601
You like the food?
- Very much.

221
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:11,437
I mean,
we haven't eaten anything yet, -

222
00:21:11,646 --> 00:21:15,275
but the food we've seen looks good.

223
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:19,070
I'll get the menu for you.
- Thank you.

224
00:21:20,363 --> 00:21:21,990
Thank you.

225
00:21:27,662 --> 00:21:30,164
Let's get out of here.
- Take it easy now.

226
00:21:30,373 --> 00:21:34,127
She'll help you.
I'll get back to work. - Okay.

227
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:38,715
We can take the photos
after you've eaten. - Sure.

228
00:21:38,882 --> 00:21:40,550
All right then.

229
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:43,553
Here you are, gentlemen.
The menu.

230
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:46,598
Okay. Thank you.

231
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:58,067
How's your weight?

232
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:02,322
60 some odd kilos.

233
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:07,911
What does "60 some odd" mean?
- A little over 60.

234
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:13,041
Is everything okay?
- Yes.

235
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:21,549
You realize this is damn important
for you? - Of course.

236
00:22:22,717 --> 00:22:25,637
Focus on what's important.

237
00:22:25,887 --> 00:22:28,389
We'll make sure
that when all this is over, -

238
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:32,185
you can say
that August 17th, 1962, -

239
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:35,229
was the happiest clay of your life.
- Yeah.

240
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:38,441
The bread is really good.

241
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:03,466
Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

242
00:23:58,813 --> 00:24:01,649
Can I take this bouquet?
- Sure.

243
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:08,281
Hold this, please.
- Sure.

244
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:14,620
Thanks.

245
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,113
Come here. Quick.

246
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:58,331
Flowers?
- I thought I'd scare him.

247
00:24:58,498 --> 00:25:00,958
Throw them away.
Throw them away.

248
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:03,211
I'll say they're from all of us.
- No.

249
00:25:03,336 --> 00:25:05,046
I'll say you chose them.

250
00:25:20,311 --> 00:25:22,271
Give him the flowers.

251
00:25:35,118 --> 00:25:38,704
Something's wrong with my camera.
Can you give one more kiss?

252
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:44,335
Something's wrong.

253
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:47,463
One more kiss, please.

254
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:24,458
How have Olli's preparations gone?

255
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:35,469
Sorry, what was the question?
- How have your preparations gone?

256
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:40,933
They've gone very well.
Nothing special.

257
00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:45,855
Maki has only fought ten matches
as a professional.

258
00:26:46,022 --> 00:26:47,940
Moore has fought 64 matches, -

259
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:51,360
more than half of which
he's won by knockout.

260
00:26:51,569 --> 00:26:55,740
Are you scared?
- No. Why should I be?

261
00:26:55,990 --> 00:27:01,204
I'm happy to be able to fight
such a good boxer.

262
00:27:01,412 --> 00:27:05,458
At least I won't be losing
to a bad one.

263
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:09,420
I'll fight,
and we'll see what happens.

264
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:13,674
"I'll fight, and...
- Why don't you write:

265
00:27:13,883 --> 00:27:16,844
Olli Maki isn't scared
of anyone or anything.

266
00:27:17,178 --> 00:27:21,140
Olli has almost 300 amateur
matches under his belt.

267
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:24,518
He won the European title in 1959.

268
00:27:24,769 --> 00:27:28,022
Of his ten professional matches,
he's won eight.

269
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:30,024
He's in incredible shape, -

270
00:27:30,191 --> 00:27:34,695
focused 100 percent on bringing
the championship to Finland.

271
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:41,702
This will be
a great national sports event.

272
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:46,165
We promise the audience
we won't let them down.

273
00:27:47,917 --> 00:27:50,628
Olli, you have to get
your act together.- What?

274
00:27:50,795 --> 00:27:54,548
You have to tell people you'll go
through a wall if you have to, -

275
00:27:54,757 --> 00:27:57,426
not "I'll fight,
and we'll see what happens."

276
00:27:58,511 --> 00:28:00,972
Is everything okay?
- Yes.

277
00:28:20,074 --> 00:28:22,493
Bye. Bye-

278
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:27,957
Is something wrong?
- I'm not sure.

279
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:33,045
Can I be honest? - Of course.
You have to be honest with me.

280
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,507
You know, I think...

281
00:28:38,009 --> 00:28:42,847
I think I'm in love.
- Bye.

282
00:28:43,014 --> 00:28:45,182
I see.

283
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:49,937
This is a very bad moment
to discuss things like that.

284
00:28:50,104 --> 00:28:53,566
I had to tell you. I realized it
at the press conference.

285
00:28:55,318 --> 00:28:59,113
Can you deal with this... thing?
- Sure.

286
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:03,909
We can't let anything come
between you and the match.

287
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:08,497
It's obvious that the match is
my main goal at the moment.

288
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:11,334
Goddammit, Olli.
What is this nonsense?

289
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,837
This is the shittiest moment
to fall in love. - Yeah, yeah.

290
00:29:15,046 --> 00:29:17,757
Get your act together.
Thanks, bye.

291
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:21,969
I just said that I'm in love.
- Everything's okay, right?

292
00:29:22,136 --> 00:29:24,764
What's so terrible about it?
I just said...

293
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,683
This is what I meant.

294
00:29:28,017 --> 00:29:31,937
Olli, are you already
under 57 kilos?

295
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:34,940
Not yet.
- He doesn't even need to be yet.

296
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:37,651
I'm on schedule.
- But you will be under it?

297
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:39,612
Of course.

298
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:48,329
That went well.
- Yes, it did. It was perfect.

299
00:29:48,788 --> 00:29:51,874
Speed! Way to go, Olli!

300
00:29:53,918 --> 00:29:55,544
Faster!

301
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:05,179
Hey! My ankle's still bothering me.

302
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:11,644
I'll buy us frankfurters.
- Oh.

303
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,939
I don't know if I can eat any.

304
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,566
Sim Sala Bim.

305
00:30:18,651 --> 00:30:21,153
Wow.
- I love this.

306
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,490
I can tell. - This is so much fun.
Let's go to the corner.

307
00:30:24,657 --> 00:30:26,450
This is the best spot.

308
00:30:29,245 --> 00:30:31,038
Excuse me.

309
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:37,753
Don't throw before he whistles.

310
00:30:40,423 --> 00:30:42,091
Fatima isn't here today.

311
00:30:43,217 --> 00:30:45,594
But they're nice as well.

312
00:30:46,095 --> 00:30:47,888
Now you can throw.

313
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:58,441
Now they're swimming.

314
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:26,969
Hi.
- Hi.

315
00:31:31,474 --> 00:31:33,684
A long run?
- Yeah.

316
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:36,896
You ran all the way?
- Yeah, that's what happened.

317
00:31:37,938 --> 00:31:40,024
You rode your bike beside him?

318
00:31:41,317 --> 00:31:42,943
Okay.

319
00:31:48,699 --> 00:31:51,619
I see. I see.

320
00:31:53,496 --> 00:31:57,583
Why did you lie to him? - He's
under enough pressure as it is.

321
00:31:58,334 --> 00:32:02,546
I can focus better when he's
not on my back the whole time.

322
00:32:04,757 --> 00:32:06,509
I'll go take a shower.

323
00:32:11,305 --> 00:32:13,349
I'll go take a shower.
- Uh-huh.

324
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:25,069
A little harder.

325
00:32:27,321 --> 00:32:29,114
Good job, guys!
- Olli!

326
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:33,077
You can't give up!

327
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:37,373
Move your feet. Good.

328
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:48,842
Hi. C'mon in.
We'll warm up a bit.

329
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:52,429
I think this would be
a good spot for filming.

330
00:33:20,249 --> 00:33:22,084
Olli, that's enough.

331
00:33:22,293 --> 00:33:24,753
Come here. Come.

332
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:35,139
Could you box for the camera?
- How?

333
00:33:35,556 --> 00:33:39,476
Pretend that the camera
is your opponent. Like this.

334
00:33:41,729 --> 00:33:44,023
Right.
- Lights.

335
00:33:57,453 --> 00:34:01,749
Go ahead, box.
I'll check how it looks.

336
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:04,043
Box. Box.

337
00:34:05,586 --> 00:34:07,379
That's good. Roll it.

338
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:10,257
Go ahead, box.

339
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:12,885
Look cruel.

340
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:16,180
Knock him out.

341
00:34:16,597 --> 00:34:19,933
Come closer. That's it.

342
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:27,941
Thanks. That's enough.
- Yep. Thanks.

343
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:37,826
Damn good. This is what we need.
Excellent.

344
00:34:38,494 --> 00:34:42,706
Thank you. Are we going
to shoot the home scene today?

345
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:46,377
Hi.
- Hello.

346
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:53,092
Go ahead, go in.
- Where do you want the plant?

347
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,386
Bring it in.

348
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:57,346
Hi.

349
00:34:57,846 --> 00:35:03,435
Eevi and Snadi and Anneli.
Everybody in. Come.

350
00:35:07,356 --> 00:35:12,319
Eevi, don't push the buttons.
Go to Mom. Go.

351
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:41,515
Look into the camera.

352
00:35:48,564 --> 00:35:50,399
Hi.
- Look into the camera.

353
00:35:56,155 --> 00:35:58,824
We're ready.
- We're not.

354
00:35:58,991 --> 00:36:00,617
We don't need you yet.

355
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:06,206
Let's start
with Olli entering the house.

356
00:36:06,582 --> 00:36:10,669
Shall I enter alone or with Raija?
- Alone.

357
00:36:11,003 --> 00:36:13,088
Yeah, maybe it's better.
- Yeah.

358
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,340
Why don't you go there.

359
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:19,511
Why couldn't Raija enter with me?

360
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:22,806
You're preparing for
a world championship match.

361
00:36:22,973 --> 00:36:26,810
It doesn't look good if you have
a chick on your arm all the time.

362
00:36:28,604 --> 00:36:32,608
Shall we go out?
- Olli, please go outside.

363
00:36:32,775 --> 00:36:35,903
You'll greet him inside.
- Right.

364
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:39,573
You'll go outside,
and I'll greet you inside.

365
00:36:39,782 --> 00:36:41,408
Shut the door.

366
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:45,996
Action.

367
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:49,792
Oh.

368
00:36:53,253 --> 00:36:55,214
Hi.
- Hello.

369
00:37:01,762 --> 00:37:04,765
I see.
- Good. Thank you.

370
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:10,229
Was it okay?
- I think it was really nice.

371
00:37:10,479 --> 00:37:12,105
Good.

372
00:37:13,273 --> 00:37:15,526
Pour the coffee, please.

373
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:20,280
Pour coffee for Olli, please.

374
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:27,246
Please go back to your place.

375
00:37:43,262 --> 00:37:46,682
Nice house.
- Yeah.

376
00:37:46,849 --> 00:37:53,105
This belongs to an acquaintance
of Elis. He doesn't use it.

377
00:37:54,648 --> 00:38:00,279
I wonder what there is to do here.
- Here? There's nothing to do here.

378
00:38:04,992 --> 00:38:06,660
Look inside.

379
00:38:56,793 --> 00:38:58,420
All right.

380
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:01,340
What do you think?

381
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:03,842
Is it finished?
- Yes.

382
00:39:05,969 --> 00:39:08,055
Okay. Thank you.

383
00:39:26,949 --> 00:39:28,575
Hello.
- Hello.

384
00:39:28,742 --> 00:39:32,663
When does the next train
to Kokkola leave? - In an hour.

385
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:35,791
Is it the last one today?
- Yes, it is.

386
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:38,669
One ticket, please.

387
00:39:44,257 --> 00:39:49,429
Good. Keep your hands up.
Harder, Olli. Harder.

388
00:39:49,596 --> 00:39:53,642
Move your feet. That's it.
Keep your hands up all the time.

389
00:39:55,227 --> 00:39:58,355
Very good. Hit him.

390
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:03,193
Hi.
- Hello. Am I interrupting?

391
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:07,572
A little. What is it?
- I thought I'd go visit home.

392
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:10,909
I just bought a ticket,
and the train is leaving.

393
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:13,286
Can you tell Olli?
- Sure.

394
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:16,790
Take care.
- Have a good trip.

395
00:40:16,957 --> 00:40:18,583
Thanks.

396
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:23,171
Olli, now it's starting to look...
What?

397
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:27,926
Where did Raija go?
- She went home. But now...

398
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:30,470
Did you tell her to leave?
- Of course not.

399
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:34,516
She came here and said her train
is leaving. But this is...

400
00:40:34,683 --> 00:40:36,727
Oh, she said, "Take care."

401
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:39,438
But this is starting to look good.

402
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:39,015
I'll listen to your lungs.

403
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:44,229
Take a deep breath.

404
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:50,694
Olli, come. You can do that later.

405
00:42:55,323 --> 00:42:58,451
He has no business fighting
in the adult weight class.

406
00:42:59,786 --> 00:43:01,580
How much is it?

407
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:03,748
It's a little over...

408
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:08,795
It's a little over... 60.
- Over 60?

409
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:10,797
What the hell?

410
00:43:11,047 --> 00:43:13,341
It's too damn much.

411
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:17,429
Are you a clown? Are you a clown?
- No, I'm not.

412
00:43:18,722 --> 00:43:20,599
The weight is what it is.

413
00:43:21,558 --> 00:43:23,643
57 is too low.

414
00:43:23,894 --> 00:43:27,230
We agreed on this weeks ago.
We can't change it now.

415
00:43:27,981 --> 00:43:30,442
Your class would've been
right for me.

416
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:33,862
What? - 61 kilos
would've been just right.

417
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:43,371
How the hell can it be over 60?

418
00:43:43,997 --> 00:43:46,458
How many weeks
have I been telling you -

419
00:43:46,625 --> 00:43:50,045
you have to lose weight?
How many weeks?

420
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:55,300
I've never failed
to make the weight.

421
00:43:56,968 --> 00:43:58,637
Good.

422
00:44:01,765 --> 00:44:03,391
Elis.

423
00:44:26,373 --> 00:44:28,375
I'll go get some fresh air.

424
00:44:57,445 --> 00:45:00,865
Sit on the bench. That's good.

425
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:05,036
Are you going to be okay?
- Yeah, I'll be okay.

426
00:45:05,203 --> 00:45:09,541
If you feel dizzy, put your head
between your knees. Sit here.

427
00:45:09,708 --> 00:45:11,334
You want water?

428
00:45:13,503 --> 00:45:16,631
No, I'll be fine.

429
00:45:32,981 --> 00:45:35,275
You look pretty serious
in the picture.

430
00:45:35,442 --> 00:45:38,320
I thought this was Olli's match,
but it's Elis's.

431
00:45:38,486 --> 00:45:42,657
"Elis Ask's world championship
match." - Look at the poster.

432
00:45:45,702 --> 00:45:48,246
Come take a photo with us.
- All right.

433
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:51,082
I see, high society is calling.

434
00:45:53,585 --> 00:45:57,756
Hello.
- Step in the middle.

435
00:45:58,715 --> 00:46:02,427
Show your fists.
- Well... Sure.

436
00:46:06,389 --> 00:46:09,017
Thank you.
- Olli!

437
00:46:09,184 --> 00:46:10,810
Come here, will you?

438
00:46:16,733 --> 00:46:18,526
Gentlemen, this is Olli Maki.

439
00:46:18,693 --> 00:46:22,113
The match has been made possible
by these gentlemen.

440
00:46:22,364 --> 00:46:24,282
Hello. Olli.

441
00:46:24,657 --> 00:46:26,493
Hello.

442
00:46:27,911 --> 00:46:29,621
Hello.

443
00:46:29,788 --> 00:46:32,624
So this is what our new
national hero looks like?

444
00:46:32,874 --> 00:46:35,752
Well, let's fight first.

445
00:46:36,211 --> 00:46:38,338
It's nice that you're modest, -

446
00:46:38,505 --> 00:46:41,549
but we want a world champion.
- Absolutely.

447
00:46:41,758 --> 00:46:44,719
It's important
that we have a home match.

448
00:46:44,928 --> 00:46:48,390
That way the Finnish people
can support him. - That's right.

449
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:51,226
It might be easier
to fight in the home ring, -

450
00:46:51,393 --> 00:46:53,895
but public support
is really important.

451
00:46:54,062 --> 00:46:57,941
How many tickets have you sold?
- We still have about 4,000 left.

452
00:47:10,245 --> 00:47:12,038
You hear that, Olli?
- Yeah?

453
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:18,837
Could I use the phone?
I need to take care of something.

454
00:47:19,963 --> 00:47:22,715
It's in the back.
- Thanks.

455
00:47:25,718 --> 00:47:27,345
Hello.
- Hey.

456
00:47:47,365 --> 00:47:48,992
Hi, this is Olli.

457
00:47:51,703 --> 00:47:53,830
At the theater?

458
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:55,999
Yeah.

459
00:47:56,541 --> 00:48:00,879
No, that's okay.
I can try again later.

460
00:48:04,591 --> 00:48:06,342
Tell her I said hi.

461
00:48:06,593 --> 00:48:08,428
Okay. Bye.

462
00:48:21,357 --> 00:48:24,444
What the hell?
- She wasn't home.

463
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:29,407
Haven't I mingled enough?
- What are you doing?

464
00:48:30,575 --> 00:48:33,244
Did I do something wrong?
You need something?

465
00:48:33,411 --> 00:48:35,413
You have problems?
- No.

466
00:48:36,623 --> 00:48:41,628
Those people are ready to give
you money and support you.

467
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:43,922
And what do you do?

468
00:48:44,088 --> 00:48:47,175
You sneak away to call
the goddamn backwater town.

469
00:48:47,509 --> 00:48:49,969
What's wrong with you, Olli?

470
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:57,852
Boys, how about a group photo?
- Of course.

471
00:49:13,868 --> 00:49:15,537
World champion.

472
00:49:22,335 --> 00:49:24,921
Oh, you want to be in it too.
- Is it okay?

473
00:51:57,323 --> 00:51:58,950
Time!

474
00:51:59,534 --> 00:52:01,160
Olli, you're next.

475
00:52:30,022 --> 00:52:31,649
All right.

476
00:52:43,369 --> 00:52:45,121
Don't feel sorry for him!

477
00:52:52,879 --> 00:52:54,672
Don't feel sorry for him!

478
00:52:55,047 --> 00:52:56,716
Punch him!

479
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:00,428
Come on!

480
00:53:10,396 --> 00:53:12,690
Punch him harder!

481
00:53:12,857 --> 00:53:16,736
Good. Punch him!
Don't feel sorry for him! - Time!

482
00:53:16,903 --> 00:53:18,529
Good job!

483
00:53:19,113 --> 00:53:23,409
All right. Now it's starting
to look the way it should.

484
00:53:50,102 --> 00:53:51,729
<i>Goddammit!</i>

485
00:53:54,857 --> 00:53:58,903
<i>Listen! How did
you spend all our money?</i>

486
00:54:00,655 --> 00:54:02,657
<i>We can't live like this!</i>

487
00:54:04,784 --> 00:54:06,953
<i>Get us money. I don't care how.</i>

488
00:54:11,958 --> 00:54:16,921
Take your coats.
We'll put them on downstairs.

489
00:54:17,171 --> 00:54:18,798
Goddammit!

490
00:54:55,042 --> 00:54:57,837
Daddy's going inside
to say hi to a friend.

491
00:54:58,087 --> 00:55:00,464
I'll be back soon. Wait in the car.

492
00:55:23,905 --> 00:55:26,908
What? You need to poop? Okay.

493
00:55:27,825 --> 00:55:30,828
Just a moment.

494
00:55:34,916 --> 00:55:36,626
Wait in the car.

495
00:55:45,885 --> 00:55:47,511
Are you soaked?

496
00:55:48,596 --> 00:55:51,724
Eevi needs to use the bathroom.
- Come on in.

497
00:55:51,891 --> 00:55:53,809
That's why we needed to come in.

498
00:55:53,976 --> 00:55:56,562
Eevi needs to use the bathroom.
- Okay.

499
00:55:57,813 --> 00:56:01,859
May she use the bathroom? - Sure.
It's on the left. Go ahead.

500
00:56:02,026 --> 00:56:03,945
Go ahead.

501
00:56:05,154 --> 00:56:07,406
I'll come wipe soon.

502
00:56:07,615 --> 00:56:09,825
Go ahead, sit on the toilet.

503
00:56:22,755 --> 00:56:28,344
I have my daughter with me.
She needed to use the bathroom.

504
00:56:28,511 --> 00:56:32,348
The others are waiting in the car.
The weather is pretty horrible.

505
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:34,350
Well.

506
00:56:34,809 --> 00:56:38,854
How much do you need?
-just enough for daily expenses.

507
00:56:39,021 --> 00:56:41,983
For tomorrow
and the clay after tomorrow.

508
00:56:42,650 --> 00:56:47,196
300,000? 250,000?

509
00:56:47,405 --> 00:56:50,741
200,000 is okay.
Whatever you think is appropriate.

510
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:53,160
I'll write you
a check for 300,000 -

511
00:56:53,327 --> 00:56:55,746
so that you can concentrate
on your work.

512
00:56:57,915 --> 00:57:02,795
Here you go.
- Thank you. This really helps.

513
00:57:02,962 --> 00:57:05,006
Your support is important.

514
00:57:05,881 --> 00:57:09,927
I hear Maki is a communist.

515
00:57:12,179 --> 00:57:14,890
As far as I know, he's a baker.

516
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:21,188
Olli is an excellent boxer.

517
00:57:21,355 --> 00:57:27,528
I don't follow politics,
so I don't know what he is.

518
00:57:27,737 --> 00:57:29,989
I promise
you won't be disappointed.

519
00:57:30,197 --> 00:57:31,907
Olli is in incredible shape.

520
00:57:32,116 --> 00:57:35,995
We're making
a world champion here, so...

521
00:57:37,705 --> 00:57:39,415
Nice to hear.

522
00:57:39,832 --> 00:57:45,046
See you on Saturday then.
- Yes. Sorry for the disturbance.

523
00:57:45,212 --> 00:57:47,381
We'll leave now.
See you on Saturday.

524
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:50,551
Let's get out quick.

525
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:53,596
Thank you. Bye.

526
00:57:58,601 --> 00:58:02,980
Where's Eevi?
- Is she still in the bathroom?

527
00:58:04,065 --> 00:58:06,275
Fucking hell.

528
00:58:06,692 --> 00:58:08,319
Wait here.

529
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:17,870
Hello again. We... - We forgot
his daughter in the bathroom.

530
00:58:18,037 --> 00:58:20,956
Yes, we left the kid there.
Would it be possible...

531
00:58:21,123 --> 00:58:23,709
Come on in.
- Thank you.

532
00:58:23,876 --> 00:58:25,503
Thank you.

533
00:58:28,214 --> 00:58:31,050
Eevi. Are you ready?

534
00:58:33,385 --> 00:58:35,054
Yeah.

535
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:52,530
There he is. - Thank you.
Sorry for the disturbance.

536
00:58:52,738 --> 00:58:55,783
You have everything now?
- Now we do. Thank you.

537
00:59:11,674 --> 00:59:13,425
Hi, this is Olli.

538
00:59:13,592 --> 00:59:15,219
Is Raija home?

539
00:59:17,346 --> 00:59:21,308
Right. Do you know
when she'll be home?

540
00:59:24,103 --> 00:59:26,772
Yeah. Okay.

541
00:59:27,815 --> 00:59:31,610
Well, bye then. Yes. Bye.

542
00:59:56,802 --> 01:00:00,806
BECOMING A CHAMPION
IN AN AJANMIES SUIT

543
01:00:05,644 --> 01:00:08,772
It arrives at 6:58 in Kokkola.
- Okay. I'll wait here.

544
01:00:08,939 --> 01:00:11,066
Thank you. Welcome.
- Thanks.

545
01:01:19,176 --> 01:01:20,844
Wall!

546
01:01:21,428 --> 01:01:23,097
Let's break it!

547
01:01:26,225 --> 01:01:30,062
Don't break it!
- All right. Good.

548
01:01:32,273 --> 01:01:34,566
Now you get to go home.

549
01:01:35,901 --> 01:01:38,570
<i>BYE- See you!
' See you!</i>

550
01:01:56,005 --> 01:02:00,050
What are you thinking?
- Nothing.

551
01:02:01,552 --> 01:02:03,554
You're thinking about something.

552
01:02:04,596 --> 01:02:06,682
It's impossible to stop thinking.

553
01:02:11,812 --> 01:02:15,566
I ran away.
- Why?

554
01:02:17,401 --> 01:02:22,156
I couldn't focus there.
- Can you focus here?

555
01:02:30,372 --> 01:02:32,041
Come help me put these away.

556
01:02:32,207 --> 01:02:34,501
The band is rehearsing
here tomorrow.

557
01:02:34,668 --> 01:02:37,129
They get mad
if I leave stuff lying around.

558
01:02:43,719 --> 01:02:46,555
<i>Goddammit, Olli.
What's wrong with you? - fight.</i>

559
01:02:46,722 --> 01:02:51,352
<i>The arena is full of people
who want to see you train.</i>

560
01:02:51,518 --> 01:02:55,230
<i>But you run to some
goddamn backwoods! - Err, well...</i>

561
01:02:55,397 --> 01:02:57,608
I'm training here.

562
01:02:57,775 --> 01:03:00,361
<i>You understand?
Get back here immediately!</i>

563
01:03:00,527 --> 01:03:03,113
<i>Tomorrow.
- You understand?</i>

564
01:03:03,322 --> 01:03:07,451
<i>Yes. Good. fight. Bye.
- You have to train...</i>

565
01:03:14,625 --> 01:03:17,795
How are things in Helsinki?
- They're good.

566
01:03:18,253 --> 01:03:21,965
Don't you want to eat with us?
- I still have to lose weight.

567
01:03:22,132 --> 01:03:24,635
That's terrible.
You're so skinny as it is.

568
01:03:24,802 --> 01:03:27,971
At least have coffee.
- Sure. I'll have a cup.

569
01:03:35,479 --> 01:03:37,523
I have to pedal fast here.

570
01:03:41,402 --> 01:03:43,195
The road is a bit soft.

571
01:03:43,404 --> 01:03:45,364
Hold on.

572
01:03:45,989 --> 01:03:47,616
Here's a curve.

573
01:04:47,342 --> 01:04:50,053
You have to come to Helsinki
with me. - Again?

574
01:04:50,304 --> 01:04:52,306
I can't focus if you're not there.

575
01:04:53,515 --> 01:04:55,309
What do you think I am?

576
01:04:57,978 --> 01:05:00,814
You can't come here
just because you're scared -

577
01:05:00,981 --> 01:05:03,150
to be somewhere else.
- It's not that.

578
01:05:03,317 --> 01:05:06,445
That's how you behave.
- I just...

579
01:05:08,697 --> 01:05:10,365
What if I lose?

580
01:05:11,366 --> 01:05:13,785
What if people are
disappointed in me -

581
01:05:13,952 --> 01:05:16,663
and realize I'm not
the guy they advertised?

582
01:05:18,373 --> 01:05:20,250
What if you're disappointed?

583
01:05:20,459 --> 01:05:24,254
How could I be disappointed when
I haven't asked anything of you?

584
01:05:27,674 --> 01:05:29,551
If anyone's disappointed, -

585
01:05:29,718 --> 01:05:32,137
it's because
of his own stupid fantasies.

586
01:05:32,304 --> 01:05:34,223
You're not responsible for them.

587
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:40,187
Is that so?
- Yes, it is.

588
01:05:44,441 --> 01:05:46,276
Will you marry me?

589
01:05:47,528 --> 01:05:49,613
Will you become the world champion?

590
01:05:50,697 --> 01:05:52,324
Of course I will.

591
01:05:53,367 --> 01:05:55,244
Okay, I'll marry you.

592
01:06:39,746 --> 01:06:41,582
Okay, let's get going.

593
01:07:24,458 --> 01:07:30,797
Imagine a sold-out crowd shouting,
"Olli! Olli! Olli!"

594
01:07:31,423 --> 01:07:34,509
A terrible thought.
- A terrible thought?

595
01:07:37,262 --> 01:07:39,556
You might think you're modest, -

596
01:07:40,682 --> 01:07:43,644
but do you realize
how your modesty sounds?

597
01:07:44,978 --> 01:07:47,147
I'm doing all this for you.

598
01:07:47,397 --> 01:07:51,443
Dozens of people
are here working for you.

599
01:07:51,693 --> 01:07:53,862
Maybe that's not exactly
what I want.

600
01:07:54,363 --> 01:07:57,366
What is it that you want?
- I want to be left in peace.

601
01:07:57,741 --> 01:07:59,409
Peace?

602
01:07:59,576 --> 01:08:05,248
When 30,000 people are watching
you getting beat up? - No, I...

603
01:08:05,415 --> 01:08:07,959
I want peace before the match.

604
01:08:08,168 --> 01:08:11,463
Now people are shoving
microphones in my face, asking, -

605
01:08:11,630 --> 01:08:15,425
"How are you feeling?"
The film crew and this damn circus.

606
01:08:15,592 --> 01:08:17,219
You have to understand -

607
01:08:17,386 --> 01:08:19,930
that this damn circus pays
for everything.

608
01:08:21,014 --> 01:08:22,766
This isn't an amateur match -

609
01:08:22,933 --> 01:08:26,978
where your mom's selling tickets
and your dad's selling pretzels.

610
01:08:28,355 --> 01:08:30,816
Welcome to professional sports.

611
01:08:32,067 --> 01:08:34,152
The scale is totally different.

612
01:08:49,543 --> 01:08:52,254
Of course I want
to fight the match. I just...

613
01:08:54,965 --> 01:08:59,094
...wish I didn't have to deal
with all the people and the fuss.

614
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:05,308
We can't have the match at the
Workers' Hall in your small town.

615
01:09:09,771 --> 01:09:13,233
Raffle tickets. 20 marks each!

616
01:09:13,442 --> 01:09:16,069
Pretzels, 30 marks a piece!

617
01:09:16,361 --> 01:09:19,281
Davey Moore alone cost 12 million.

618
01:09:22,576 --> 01:09:27,956
I understand, but I'd just
like to focus alone in peace.

619
01:09:29,332 --> 01:09:34,045
If you want peace,
I'll arrange it for you.

620
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:11,666
Well.

621
01:10:12,626 --> 01:10:14,377
Are you going to be okay?

622
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:16,922
Yeah, I'll be fine.

623
01:10:20,383 --> 01:10:22,052
Huh?

624
01:13:57,267 --> 01:13:58,893
Davey Moore.

625
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:01,146
56.5 kilos.

626
01:14:06,359 --> 01:14:08,778
Then Olli Maki.
- Olli.

627
01:14:12,407 --> 01:14:14,034
Can you hold this?

628
01:14:33,553 --> 01:14:35,638
Take your shorts off.
Take them off.

629
01:14:51,988 --> 01:14:53,615
Olli Maki.

630
01:14:53,782 --> 01:14:56,910
56.98 kilos.

631
01:15:05,627 --> 01:15:07,253
Thank you.

632
01:15:12,467 --> 01:15:14,094
Olli.

633
01:15:17,639 --> 01:15:22,352
Good job. Great.

634
01:15:23,937 --> 01:15:27,565
You did it. Olli, you did it.

635
01:15:33,279 --> 01:15:37,492
Oh, we're taking pictures.
Let's go.

636
01:15:43,706 --> 01:15:45,875
Olli, come take pictures with us.

637
01:16:02,350 --> 01:16:05,854
Yes, we'll take these.
- Okay.

638
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:09,732
What do you want engraved on them?
- What do people usually have?

639
01:16:10,275 --> 01:16:12,861
The date and the names.

640
01:16:14,737 --> 01:16:17,365
Why don't you write:

641
01:16:18,283 --> 01:16:23,246
Raija and Olli,
August 17th, 1962.

642
01:16:23,538 --> 01:16:25,665
Is that okay?
- Yeah.

643
01:16:26,791 --> 01:16:30,461
Okay. You can pick these up
on Monday. - Yes.

644
01:16:30,670 --> 01:16:32,422
Just a moment.
- Thank you.

645
01:17:19,969 --> 01:17:23,264
Remember that you've worked
a hell of a lot for this.

646
01:17:24,015 --> 01:17:26,559
You've practiced
in the best possible way.

647
01:17:28,102 --> 01:17:30,271
You'll go out there and enjoy.

648
01:17:30,438 --> 01:17:32,315
Show them what you know.

649
01:17:33,066 --> 01:17:36,152
Don't be afraid of anything,
not even losing.

650
01:17:36,611 --> 01:17:38,488
You know you're safe.

651
01:17:40,531 --> 01:17:43,618
If it starts going bad,
we'll always be there for you.

652
01:17:51,292 --> 01:17:53,544
Is there anything else
I can do for you?

653
01:17:54,462 --> 01:17:56,381
No. I'm ready.

654
01:18:13,606 --> 01:18:17,610
<i>Dear friends of boxing.</i>

655
01:18:20,530 --> 01:18:26,619
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
for the first time in Finland, -</i>

656
01:18:26,869 --> 01:18:30,456
<i>a world championship match.</i>

657
01:19:12,498 --> 01:19:14,751
<i>Ladies and gentlemen.</i>

658
01:19:21,549 --> 01:19:28,389
<i>Placing second in the 7957
European Amateur Championships, -</i>

659
01:19:28,931 --> 01:19:33,519
<i>winner of the 1959
European lightweight title.</i>

660
01:19:33,686 --> 01:19:38,608
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, -</i>

661
01:19:38,816 --> 01:19:42,612
<i>"The Baker of Kokkola, "
Olli Maki.</i>

662
01:20:21,526 --> 01:20:23,486
Keep your hands up. That's good.

663
01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:26,197
Good.

664
01:20:26,364 --> 01:20:28,241
Keep your feet moving.

665
01:20:53,516 --> 01:20:55,309
You're doing great!

666
01:21:09,866 --> 01:21:11,534
All right, go.

667
01:21:15,830 --> 01:21:17,498
Move your feet.

668
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:19,667
That's the way.

669
01:21:23,838 --> 01:21:26,340
Good. Good.

670
01:21:38,352 --> 01:21:40,688
Get up. Get up.

671
01:21:42,773 --> 01:21:44,442
Get Up!

672
01:21:49,447 --> 01:21:51,073
Hands up.

673
01:22:00,166 --> 01:22:01,792
Go, go, go!

674
01:22:04,795 --> 01:22:06,756
Get up. UP!

675
01:22:12,345 --> 01:22:13,971
Put your hands up.

676
01:22:14,722 --> 01:22:16,349
Hands...

677
01:22:50,675 --> 01:22:52,301
What happened?

678
01:22:54,428 --> 01:22:57,390
What happened?
- It's over.

679
01:22:57,557 --> 01:22:59,267
I couldn't see anything.

680
01:23:01,310 --> 01:23:03,187
Ladies and gentlemen.

681
01:23:03,646 --> 01:23:07,275
The winner and still champion...
Davey Moore.

682
01:23:09,235 --> 01:23:12,780
All right. Where are the flowers?

683
01:23:29,130 --> 01:23:31,048
I couldn't see him coming.

684
01:23:38,472 --> 01:23:44,437
I think I had my chin too high.

685
01:24:56,384 --> 01:24:59,303
Olli, how are you feeling?

686
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:07,353
I don't have much to say;
it happened so quickly.

687
01:25:10,398 --> 01:25:13,025
How would you describe the match?

688
01:25:14,568 --> 01:25:20,157
I think it was the easiest match
of my professional career -

689
01:25:20,324 --> 01:25:23,077
in the sense
that it was over so quickly.

690
01:25:23,244 --> 01:25:27,456
I've had full matches before,
15 rounds.

691
01:25:28,457 --> 01:25:32,169
This was over after two rounds.
- Make some room, will you?

692
01:25:33,129 --> 01:25:34,922
Put the camera down.

693
01:25:37,925 --> 01:25:42,805
Elis, could you stand in the middle
and pose for the camera with Olli?

694
01:25:43,013 --> 01:25:45,182
We're going to take the final shot.

695
01:25:47,518 --> 01:25:49,145
Elis.

696
01:25:55,067 --> 01:25:57,862
Let's go take the shot.
- Oh. Sure.

697
01:27:06,514 --> 01:27:08,933
Should we leave?
- What?

698
01:27:09,099 --> 01:27:10,768
Do you want to leave?

699
01:27:12,228 --> 01:27:14,063
Let's stay another moment.

700
01:27:45,761 --> 01:27:47,721
Or should we just leave now?

701
01:28:00,025 --> 01:28:02,444
Olli. Come here.

702
01:28:02,820 --> 01:28:06,282
Raija and I are leaving.
- No. Come here.

703
01:28:07,741 --> 01:28:09,368
Bye!

704
01:28:35,603 --> 01:28:37,730
You think we'll be like them?

705
01:28:39,481 --> 01:28:43,903
You mean old?
- Yes, and happy.

706
01:28:46,614 --> 01:28:48,365
Of course we will.

707
01:29:19,521 --> 01:29:21,148
Okay.

708
01:29:28,030 --> 01:29:29,657
One, two...
