1
00:00:15,044 --> 00:00:16,604
This...

2
00:00:17,274 --> 00:00:19,914
What color do you think they are?

3
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:22,624
Purple?

4
00:00:23,214 --> 00:00:25,754
No, it's plum-colored.

5
00:00:26,384 --> 00:00:29,314
It means eternal love.

6
00:00:32,414 --> 00:00:34,754
I love you, Soo Hyun.

7
00:00:37,354 --> 00:00:40,234
I'm different from your mom.

8
00:00:41,384 --> 00:00:44,833
I will never

9
00:00:44,834 --> 00:00:46,904
leave your side.

10
00:01:08,274 --> 00:01:10,934
<i>Final Episode</i>

11
00:01:15,444 --> 00:01:19,284
<i>Soo Hyun, will you go to
your office for a moment?</i>

12
00:01:35,734 --> 00:01:39,983
<i>Soo Hyun is gruff but he is a handsome man. Soo Hyun
is a romantic man who shows me a movie when I am sad.</i>

13
00:01:39,984 --> 00:01:43,774
<i>Soo Hyun can't write well, but he has a nice
voice. Soo Hyun is the man who made me love again.</i>

14
00:02:05,664 --> 00:02:10,464
<i>Soo Hyun, you are the man I love.</i>

15
00:02:22,854 --> 00:02:24,803
<i>I came to do a project.</i>

16
00:02:24,804 --> 00:02:28,253
<i>It's called the Choi Soo
Hyun rehabilitation project.</i>

17
00:02:28,254 --> 00:02:29,923
<i>You'll help me, won't you?</i>

18
00:02:29,924 --> 00:02:31,833
<i>Will you do it for me, please?</i>

19
00:02:31,834 --> 00:02:33,463
<i>Please eat a bit.</i>

20
00:02:33,464 --> 00:02:36,403
<i>Soo Hyun, you are responsible
for repaying my kindness.</i>

21
00:02:36,404 --> 00:02:38,664
<i>I love you, Soo Hyun.</i>

22
00:02:39,204 --> 00:02:44,684
<i>I'll never leave your side.</i>

23
00:02:47,454 --> 00:02:49,733
You're going to stop the experiment?

24
00:02:49,734 --> 00:02:50,913
Yes.

25
00:02:50,914 --> 00:02:53,413
I think it will be difficult
to do at this moment.

26
00:02:53,414 --> 00:02:54,573
I'm sorry.

27
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:57,794
Last time, you said something
similar, why again?

28
00:02:59,464 --> 00:03:01,033
What's the problem?

29
00:03:01,034 --> 00:03:03,043
I'll solve all of them for you.

30
00:03:03,044 --> 00:03:06,053
It's not a problem for you to solve.

31
00:03:06,054 --> 00:03:08,033
In my hypothesis,

32
00:03:08,034 --> 00:03:11,394
I realized that there might be an error.

33
00:03:15,274 --> 00:03:17,063
There is no such thing as
true love for a woman,

34
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:19,694
are you talking about that?

35
00:03:20,904 --> 00:03:22,403
Yes.

36
00:03:22,404 --> 00:03:25,984
That means it will really turn
this experiment upside down.

37
00:03:26,004 --> 00:03:27,753
Then, what are we going to do now?

38
00:03:27,754 --> 00:03:30,893
I already set aside the budget
to invest in your experiment,

39
00:03:30,894 --> 00:03:32,803
we also decided on the direction
marketing would take.

40
00:03:32,804 --> 00:03:38,063
I'll do my utmost to help you with marketing from
the point of view of a psychologist, however

41
00:03:38,064 --> 00:03:41,494
for now, I will postpone this experiment.

42
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:47,204
<i>This is really just a
small possibility, but</i>

43
00:03:47,224 --> 00:03:51,373
<i>Soo Hyun may say he is going
to cancel the experiment.</i>

44
00:03:51,374 --> 00:03:52,893
What?

45
00:03:52,894 --> 00:03:55,183
Do you know how much we
spent on this experiment?

46
00:03:55,184 --> 00:03:57,703
I'm sorry, Chairman.

47
00:03:57,704 --> 00:04:01,823
But if that happens, Soo Hyun has
committed a breach of contract anyway.

48
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:05,123
Let's say that the company will
compensate for the damages.

49
00:04:05,124 --> 00:04:08,893
What do you think about
scolding Soo Hyun separately?

50
00:04:08,894 --> 00:04:12,973
For example, like giving him a penalty.

51
00:04:12,974 --> 00:04:14,744
A penalty?

52
00:04:19,274 --> 00:04:22,623
Exactly what kind of plan did you come up with?
What kind of favor did you ask of the Chairman?

53
00:04:22,624 --> 00:04:23,753
What do you mean?

54
00:04:23,754 --> 00:04:28,974
All I was told was to give you psychological
counseling because you had a problem.

55
00:04:30,024 --> 00:04:34,444
That's my seat. Since you're the client,
please sit on the opposite side.

56
00:04:47,324 --> 00:04:50,274
How do you feel these days?

57
00:04:50,284 --> 00:04:52,204
Just so-so.

58
00:04:52,884 --> 00:04:53,884
Ah right!

59
00:04:53,885 --> 00:04:57,083
An interesting thing happened to me.
I'm a psychological counselor, but

60
00:04:57,084 --> 00:04:59,483
the fortune teller downstairs
said she would counsel me.

61
00:04:59,484 --> 00:05:01,653
Isn't it amusing?

62
00:05:01,654 --> 00:05:04,593
- Do you sleep well?- Yes.

63
00:05:04,594 --> 00:05:08,623
Lie. You're not sleeping or eating well.

64
00:05:08,624 --> 00:05:10,403
I do drink at least a glass of milk.

65
00:05:10,404 --> 00:05:14,573
Also, a client can lie at anytime.
Catching that

66
00:05:14,574 --> 00:05:18,773
and figuring out what kind of defense
mechanism and inner scars are present

67
00:05:18,774 --> 00:05:22,633
to help the client is the counselor's job.

68
00:05:22,634 --> 00:05:25,673
Well, that's for me to take care of.

69
00:05:25,674 --> 00:05:28,993
Soo Hyun, these days, you
don't even tear up, right?

70
00:05:28,994 --> 00:05:30,413
There's nothing for me to be sad about.

71
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:32,774
Your mom returned.

72
00:05:34,064 --> 00:05:39,423
Isn't crying my eyeballs out at the age of thirty
six because my mom came even more abnormal?

73
00:05:39,424 --> 00:05:40,833
When you were six years old,

74
00:05:40,834 --> 00:05:43,473
on top of that, it's your mom
who abandoned and left you.

75
00:05:43,474 --> 00:05:46,303
Because of that, you lost your
memories before the age of six

76
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:50,203
and still feel pain when
hit by water droplets.

77
00:05:50,204 --> 00:05:52,353
Crying and getting angry
at appropriate times,

78
00:05:52,354 --> 00:05:56,283
displaying one's emotions naturally like
that are what normal people usually do.

79
00:05:56,284 --> 00:06:00,484
Isn't crying when you see
your mom a natural reaction?

80
00:06:03,264 --> 00:06:07,243
The degree to which something causes one to
shed tears differs from person to person.

81
00:06:07,244 --> 00:06:09,673
Also, there are defense mechanisms.

82
00:06:09,674 --> 00:06:11,613
Not all defense mechanisms are bad.

83
00:06:11,614 --> 00:06:14,923
I transferred the memory of
losing my mom into psychology.

84
00:06:14,924 --> 00:06:18,114
That's a desirable defense mechanism.

85
00:06:20,884 --> 00:06:24,143
Since I'm starting to use some professional
terms, you find it hard to understand me, right?

86
00:06:24,144 --> 00:06:25,813
Ask me comfortably.

87
00:06:25,814 --> 00:06:29,604
If you find something that you
don't understand, I will help you.

88
00:06:34,704 --> 00:06:37,893
Maybe it's because I packed in a rush, there
are too many things that I didn't bring.

89
00:06:37,894 --> 00:06:39,873
Cell phone charger, underwear, socks.

90
00:06:39,874 --> 00:06:42,943
My hands are really bored because
I didn't bring my Rubik's cube.

91
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,793
Noona, can't we just buy all
that at the supermarket?

92
00:06:45,794 --> 00:06:49,513
We have to save money,
how can we buy all that?

93
00:06:49,514 --> 00:06:54,663
Also, because I bought a new camera this month,
I'm reaching my credit card's spending limit.

94
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:57,253
Out of all things, the charger. What to do?

95
00:06:57,254 --> 00:06:58,983
Even though you don't pick
up Noona Hye Rim's calls,

96
00:06:58,984 --> 00:07:01,343
if you get calls from work, it
wouldn't be good to miss them.

97
00:07:01,344 --> 00:07:04,813
I asked for a vacation so it's alright, but

98
00:07:04,814 --> 00:07:06,533
it won't do.

99
00:07:06,534 --> 00:07:08,783
I'll go and bring it without her knowing.

100
00:07:08,784 --> 00:07:10,884
How?

101
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,504
Hello.

102
00:07:35,214 --> 00:07:37,114
Hello.

103
00:07:44,914 --> 00:07:47,883
What? She just came in the house?

104
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,493
Alright, I'll go right
to her and this wench...

105
00:07:50,494 --> 00:07:51,813
<i>You can't!</i>

106
00:07:51,814 --> 00:07:55,443
If you just catch her and ask her where Ji
Ho is, do you think Yoo Rim will tell you?

107
00:07:55,444 --> 00:07:58,043
She'll just play dead
for a day and run away.

108
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:00,904
That's true. Then what should I do?

109
00:08:22,574 --> 00:08:24,413
<i>There is only one answer.</i>

110
00:08:24,414 --> 00:08:26,644
<i>Storming in on the scene.</i>

111
00:08:35,564 --> 00:08:37,784
Here. Here too.

112
00:08:41,094 --> 00:08:43,984
Noona, your neckline is very pretty.

113
00:08:45,464 --> 00:08:48,453
You! You also said you fell for my
Unni after seeing her neckline.

114
00:08:48,454 --> 00:08:52,073
No, compared to yours,
hers is just a tree trunk.

115
00:08:52,074 --> 00:08:54,193
A rough and bumpy tree trunk.

116
00:08:54,194 --> 00:08:55,564
Really?

117
00:08:56,844 --> 00:08:59,363
This is the first time I'm hearing
that I'm prettier than my sister.

118
00:08:59,364 --> 00:09:01,484
Thank you, my baby!

119
00:09:04,764 --> 00:09:08,193
Aigoo, are you lovey-dovey
and playing house?

120
00:09:08,194 --> 00:09:10,924
Unni, how did you come here?

121
00:09:13,744 --> 00:09:18,874
Do you like it? Running away and living happily in
ignorant bliss, do you like it that much? Do you? Aiyoo!

122
00:09:30,474 --> 00:09:32,463
Ji Ho,

123
00:09:32,464 --> 00:09:36,153
when I was twenty one, exactly
at your age, I got married.

124
00:09:36,154 --> 00:09:37,883
But,

125
00:09:37,884 --> 00:09:39,073
look.

126
00:09:39,074 --> 00:09:41,903
This is what your future looks like.
Do I look good? Do I look good to you?

127
00:09:41,904 --> 00:09:43,593
I thought you looked good.

128
00:09:43,594 --> 00:09:46,024
It was just because
Brother-in-law was a bastard.

129
00:09:46,684 --> 00:09:50,013
My husband having an
affair is also my fault.

130
00:09:50,014 --> 00:09:52,843
We just got married because we liked each other.
We didn't know anything about each other.

131
00:09:52,844 --> 00:09:55,633
That's why starting from how we squeeze
toothpaste to the way we clean the house,

132
00:09:55,634 --> 00:09:58,673
- we started fighting the day after the wedding—-
Both of us squeeze toothpaste from the bottom.

133
00:09:58,674 --> 00:10:00,884
- Isn't that right, Ji Ho?- Yes.

134
00:10:00,914 --> 00:10:02,603
But the cleaning...

135
00:10:02,604 --> 00:10:05,073
You can't do it everyday,
once every three days. Deal?

136
00:10:05,074 --> 00:10:06,623
Yes.

137
00:10:06,624 --> 00:10:10,463
Look. Right now, what kind of
life will you have at this rate?

138
00:10:10,464 --> 00:10:12,423
If you do things your way like
that, what if Ji Ho explodes?

139
00:10:12,424 --> 00:10:14,573
I'm not a volcano. I won't explode.

140
00:10:14,574 --> 00:10:16,343
I've got a firm grasp
on him, so don't worry.

141
00:10:16,344 --> 00:10:21,284
Also, as you know, he's blank, white drawing
paper. I can just draw on him as I please.

142
00:10:22,034 --> 00:10:25,343
Fine, let's say you two got married
after I yielded a hundred times.

143
00:10:25,344 --> 00:10:28,713
How are you going to get a house?
We can rent it.

144
00:10:28,714 --> 00:10:31,573
The smallest 18 pyeong <i>(1 pyeong = 3.3 m2)</i> room costs
700,000 to 1,000,000 Won a month. ($700-$1,000)

145
00:10:31,574 --> 00:10:34,003
You, can you handle that kind of rent?

146
00:10:34,004 --> 00:10:36,223
Above all that, how are the two of you
going to sleep in that tiny room?

147
00:10:36,224 --> 00:10:40,454
We're going to hold onto each other tight and
sleep together, why? Try finding another fault!

148
00:10:42,094 --> 00:10:43,783
Fine.

149
00:10:43,784 --> 00:10:47,153
Then, let's end our relations.

150
00:10:47,154 --> 00:10:48,283
What?!

151
00:10:48,284 --> 00:10:50,393
Why does talk about relations
suddenly come out?

152
00:10:50,394 --> 00:10:53,433
I tried so hard so you wouldn't
face a fate like mine,

153
00:10:53,434 --> 00:10:55,453
but since you're coming
out like this, well.

154
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:58,613
From now on, let's live
without seeing each other.

155
00:10:58,614 --> 00:11:03,124
Today, you and I are finished.
In the future, bye-bye. Okay?

156
00:11:04,654 --> 00:11:06,574
I'm pregnant.

157
00:11:13,904 --> 00:11:16,233
To be honest, I didn't
want to tell you this but,

158
00:11:16,234 --> 00:11:17,644
I am with child.

159
00:11:17,654 --> 00:11:21,014
So, I have to marry him
as soon as possible.

160
00:11:23,354 --> 00:11:25,043
Noona, do you really...

161
00:11:25,044 --> 00:11:27,084
You'll congratulate me, right?

162
00:11:30,784 --> 00:11:33,593
Are you in your right mind, right now?
Are you?

163
00:11:33,594 --> 00:11:36,514
Are you beating a pregnant woman?

164
00:11:38,674 --> 00:11:43,483
What did you do? This young bastard! Ji Ho!

165
00:11:43,484 --> 00:11:45,753
Noona, I'm sorry. Sorry.

166
00:11:45,754 --> 00:11:49,164
He didn't do anything wrong.
Hit me instead.

167
00:11:50,464 --> 00:11:55,004
Fine, you two try having a nice life!

168
00:11:56,234 --> 00:11:58,513
Unni!

169
00:11:58,514 --> 00:12:00,903
Noona, is it true?

170
00:12:00,904 --> 00:12:01,973
Do you really have my child...

171
00:12:01,974 --> 00:12:05,354
Are you crazy? It's a lie. Unni!

172
00:12:06,544 --> 00:12:11,073
Unni! Unni, I'm sorry! I did wrong!

173
00:12:11,074 --> 00:12:14,713
Don't run, you wench! What if
something happens to the baby?!

174
00:12:14,714 --> 00:12:18,603
Unni, we will live well
so don't be against us...

175
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:21,644
For now, come to the house.
We'll talk inside.

176
00:12:39,914 --> 00:12:41,533
Doctor, here are the documents.

177
00:12:41,534 --> 00:12:43,824
Yes, thank you.

178
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:54,174
Doctor, my friend had a stomach ulcer.

179
00:12:54,754 --> 00:12:57,263
But since he hates hospitals,

180
00:12:57,264 --> 00:13:00,613
he ate and exercised well,
and I think after one year,

181
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:03,814
he went to the hospital for a check up and
it turns out he was completely cured.

182
00:13:07,054 --> 00:13:09,824
So are you saying that I will
have gotten better, too?

183
00:13:10,774 --> 00:13:14,304
Do you think that a stomach
ulcer and cancer are the same?

184
00:13:14,974 --> 00:13:18,733
In any case, an illness is an illness.

185
00:13:18,734 --> 00:13:22,863
So Doctor, even if you don't undergo
surgery, at least get examined.

186
00:13:22,864 --> 00:13:27,013
You also lived happily
with a positive mind,

187
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:31,464
it's possible that the cancer may have
gotten a bit better, don't you think?

188
00:13:34,374 --> 00:13:41,184
Fine, I will directly show you
what kind of condition I am in.

189
00:13:50,464 --> 00:13:55,083
It's not good. It has metastasized
from the lymph nodes to the liver.

190
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,263
Pardon?

191
00:13:56,264 --> 00:13:58,943
Now, not only does she
need radiation therapy,

192
00:13:58,944 --> 00:14:04,623
she also needs chemotherapy. Surgery
is also definitely necessary.

193
00:14:04,624 --> 00:14:07,744
What is the percentage
of complete recovery?

194
00:14:08,944 --> 00:14:12,134
About 30%.

195
00:14:17,734 --> 00:14:23,523
Doctor, still he said the percentage of
full recovery is higher than other cancers.

196
00:14:23,524 --> 00:14:27,093
Undergo surgery and receive
treatment, please?

197
00:14:27,094 --> 00:14:32,583
For thyroid cancer, ten years must pass before
one can know the chances of full recovery.

198
00:14:32,584 --> 00:14:35,673
If it's ten years from now,

199
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:39,504
at that age, I won't be able
to finish my bucket list.

200
00:14:40,764 --> 00:14:43,264
While I still have the strength,

201
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:48,233
while doing my bucket list,
I'm going to enjoy my life.

202
00:14:48,234 --> 00:14:52,053
Without being able to do that and spending ten
years in a hospital receiving chemotherapy

203
00:14:52,054 --> 00:14:54,884
as my life dies and rots away,

204
00:14:56,414 --> 00:14:58,624
I absolutely don't want that.

205
00:15:08,434 --> 00:15:13,873
Never tell the people in the
center about my present condition.

206
00:15:13,874 --> 00:15:19,574
If rumors start to fly about that, I will
go back to Jeju Island because of it.

207
00:15:24,864 --> 00:15:27,664
Seung Chan, the thing is...

208
00:15:28,614 --> 00:15:31,204
What? Is something wrong?

209
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:35,624
It's nothing. But, why?

210
00:15:36,754 --> 00:15:39,153
Can I go to your home for a moment today?

211
00:15:39,154 --> 00:15:40,303
Why?

212
00:15:40,304 --> 00:15:42,844
I want to act like Choi Soo Hyun.

213
00:15:44,504 --> 00:15:46,903
You're sure that Soo Hyun will
be coming home late, right?

214
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:49,763
Yes, he said he'd be having dinner
together with professors from his school.

215
00:15:49,764 --> 00:15:51,733
But why? What are you looking for?

216
00:15:51,734 --> 00:15:54,083
<i>Photos of Soo Hyun like the
ones you gave me last time.</i>

217
00:15:54,084 --> 00:15:58,403
Anything related to Soo Hyun's
emotional scar will do.

218
00:15:58,404 --> 00:16:01,503
Are there any toys or albums
from when he was a child?

219
00:16:01,504 --> 00:16:05,133
I don't know, I think he threw
them away when he moved.

220
00:16:05,134 --> 00:16:08,763
No, I think my mom took the album
when she left for Switzerland.

221
00:16:08,764 --> 00:16:11,413
Why? If you need it, should I tell her
to bring it with her when she comes?

222
00:16:11,414 --> 00:16:12,543
Your mom is coming?

223
00:16:12,544 --> 00:16:16,113
Yes, together with my father. She said they're
coming briefly for a relative's wedding.

224
00:16:16,114 --> 00:16:19,143
Then, is there anything
else besides the album?

225
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:23,053
I'm not sure, if it's something that'll
help you to know Hyung's mind...

226
00:16:23,054 --> 00:16:25,064
Perhaps, is it here?

227
00:16:46,314 --> 00:16:48,664
Why? Are you getting any clues?

228
00:16:49,524 --> 00:16:53,634
Yes, even though it's leading me in a
different direction, I discovered it.

229
00:17:10,574 --> 00:17:12,463
<i>Shamanism's Ethical
Principles and Symbolism</i>

230
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:14,464
<i>Between Cold-heartedness and Passion</i>

231
00:17:23,104 --> 00:17:26,284
<i>Credit Card Receipt</i>

232
00:17:29,794 --> 00:17:33,894
<i>Past love</i>

233
00:17:40,824 --> 00:17:43,923
- What is this?- It's a box.

234
00:17:43,924 --> 00:17:47,613
It was in your closet, it's
your stuff from college right?

235
00:17:47,614 --> 00:17:49,293
By any chance, did you search my room?

236
00:17:49,294 --> 00:17:54,323
Answer my question. Why did you suddenly look into
things you had while you where attending Stanford?

237
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:56,193
Did you suddenly think of Claire?

238
00:17:56,194 --> 00:17:57,623
That...

239
00:17:57,624 --> 00:18:02,773
Also what is this? You bought a necklace from Luxury
Little Shop, and that's while I was in Daejon.

240
00:18:02,774 --> 00:18:05,383
Why did you buy a necklace from a designer
shop? Who were you going to give it to?

241
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:06,663
Hye Rim.

242
00:18:06,664 --> 00:18:09,663
Also these books related to past love,
Internet searches related to past love,

243
00:18:09,664 --> 00:18:11,843
Why are you thinking of past love suddenly?

244
00:18:11,844 --> 00:18:17,474
It's Claire, right? She is back so you are thinking of those times
while looking at these things and searching the Internet, right?

245
00:18:20,354 --> 00:18:22,494
Can I talk now?

246
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:28,294
Let's hear it, although it's obvious
you'll be giving a ton of excuses.

247
00:18:29,004 --> 00:18:32,303
You're right about me opening this box because
there was something I wanted to look at.

248
00:18:32,304 --> 00:18:35,223
I wanted to make you the
omelettes that you like.

249
00:18:35,224 --> 00:18:39,893
A recipe that my roommate, who
was a good cook, was in here.

250
00:18:39,894 --> 00:18:43,773
If you can't believe me, would you like me to make
it for you according to that recipe right now?

251
00:18:43,774 --> 00:18:46,653
Then, what's with the
picture taken with Claire?

252
00:18:46,654 --> 00:18:48,833
Claire's picture was there?

253
00:18:48,834 --> 00:18:51,834
Why didn't you throw it away?
It's useless to me.

254
00:18:53,224 --> 00:18:57,733
Also this, you're right about me buying it
for a female. I already gave it to her.

255
00:18:57,734 --> 00:18:59,013
Who is it? Claire?

256
00:18:59,014 --> 00:19:00,353
I gave it to Hye Rim.

257
00:19:00,354 --> 00:19:01,593
Are you joking?

258
00:19:01,594 --> 00:19:03,893
The Pomeranian in my home, Hye Rim.

259
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:08,664
Did you not see her when you went
to my room? She was wearing it.

260
00:19:14,894 --> 00:19:18,223
Also this, I read it because of a client.

261
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:22,103
Among my clients, I have one who got dumped
by her boyfriend and is having hard time.

262
00:19:22,104 --> 00:19:27,484
So during her counseling sessions, she kept on quoting this
book, so I glanced at it to try to get a better understanding.

263
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:33,033
By the way, I guess you didn't see
the book about Shamanism next to it?

264
00:19:33,034 --> 00:19:35,984
I was reading that book because of you.

265
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:41,404
The explanation is over, your
misunderstanding is resolved, right?

266
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:56,293
Seung Chan, please book me a plane ticket.

267
00:19:56,294 --> 00:19:57,903
Ah, yes.

268
00:19:57,904 --> 00:20:00,053
Aren't you going to ask me where I'm going?

269
00:20:00,054 --> 00:20:01,663
Where are you going?

270
00:20:01,664 --> 00:20:06,694
Alaska. I'm going to leave in three
weeks to accomplish my bucket list.

271
00:20:07,444 --> 00:20:08,663
Yes.

272
00:20:08,664 --> 00:20:13,063
Is there nothing else
you want to ask about?

273
00:20:13,064 --> 00:20:14,784
No, there isn't.

274
00:20:20,884 --> 00:20:23,654
This is the reservation confirmation.

275
00:20:26,774 --> 00:20:31,003
But, the price is this expensive?

276
00:20:31,004 --> 00:20:33,344
Yes, since it's double the price.

277
00:20:34,464 --> 00:20:37,743
I also booked a ticket
so we can go together.

278
00:20:37,744 --> 00:20:40,143
I can go with you, right?

279
00:20:40,144 --> 00:20:42,293
Really?

280
00:20:42,294 --> 00:20:46,873
If you come with me, it will
really mean a great deal to me.

281
00:20:46,874 --> 00:20:52,093
But I searched a bit about Alaska.

282
00:20:52,094 --> 00:20:55,143
I know I can do it, but I think
it'll be difficult for you.

283
00:20:55,144 --> 00:20:56,403
Why?

284
00:20:56,404 --> 00:20:59,613
First of all, the plane trip
will take fifteen hours.

285
00:20:59,614 --> 00:21:02,594
Will it be possible? You
have cancer, Doctor.

286
00:21:03,424 --> 00:21:07,273
On top of that, to see the Aurora Borealis,
you have to go to a place called Fairbanks.

287
00:21:07,274 --> 00:21:10,083
During the winter, the sun barely rises.
It's all night.

288
00:21:10,084 --> 00:21:13,854
Also, the temperature drops
to -54 degrees Celsius.

289
00:21:15,104 --> 00:21:16,783
What do you want to say?

290
00:21:16,784 --> 00:21:19,624
On top of that, the weather is unstable.

291
00:21:20,334 --> 00:21:24,933
Storms, lightening, and hail.
They say it's no joke.

292
00:21:24,934 --> 00:21:29,033
Oh right. You said you also wanted
to see Machu Picchu, right?

293
00:21:29,034 --> 00:21:34,474
The altitude there is 2,400 meters. But you're
having difficulty with the mountain in front of us.

294
00:21:37,404 --> 00:21:41,483
But you can solve all
these things in one blow.

295
00:21:41,484 --> 00:21:43,253
I'm not undergoing surgery.

296
00:21:43,254 --> 00:21:46,503
Doctor, the recovery percentage is 30%.

297
00:21:46,504 --> 00:21:52,073
It's not only 30%, but 30% is left.
Why are you ignoring that?

298
00:21:52,074 --> 00:21:57,254
I'll decide what to do with my life. I
don't want to leave it to percentages.

299
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:03,253
In three weeks, I'm definitely going
to Alaska to see the Aurora Borealis.

300
00:22:03,254 --> 00:22:07,394
Whether you want to tag
along or not is up to you.

301
00:22:16,444 --> 00:22:18,414
Enjoy.

302
00:22:28,354 --> 00:22:29,984
Come upstairs.

303
00:22:38,354 --> 00:22:42,603
Drink. It's a tea good for your
hormones when you're pregnant.

304
00:22:42,604 --> 00:22:43,693
Noona, can I have a glass of water...

305
00:22:43,694 --> 00:22:45,913
Go home and stuff it
down your throat there.

306
00:22:45,914 --> 00:22:49,083
Also, why did you give her something
heavy to carry on your way in?

307
00:22:49,084 --> 00:22:52,594
Do you know how dangerous it is to do
that at the beginning of pregnancy?

308
00:22:55,014 --> 00:22:56,943
How many months along are you?

309
00:22:56,944 --> 00:23:00,823
No, I don't think it reached that far.
How many weeks along are you?

310
00:23:00,824 --> 00:23:05,724
<i>What should I do? When should
I tell her I'm not pregnant?</i>

311
00:23:06,314 --> 00:23:08,533
I bought milk, anchovies, and cheese.

312
00:23:08,534 --> 00:23:12,633
Now the baby's bones are being formed,
so you need to eat a lot of calcium.

313
00:23:12,634 --> 00:23:18,654
You need to drink water frequently, eat lots of vegetables
and fruits. Stay away from severe exercise. Okay?

314
00:23:21,924 --> 00:23:24,453
It's time, let's go.

315
00:23:24,454 --> 00:23:25,234
Where?

316
00:23:25,235 --> 00:23:27,203
I reserved an appointment
with the obstetrician.

317
00:23:27,204 --> 00:23:28,054
What?

318
00:23:28,055 --> 00:23:32,064
We need to know if the baby is doing
well and if there are any dangers.

319
00:23:33,314 --> 00:23:34,863
Let's go.

320
00:23:34,864 --> 00:23:36,903
I'm still in the early stages of
pregnancy, so I should be okay.

321
00:23:36,904 --> 00:23:38,583
It's because it's the early stages
that it's even more dangerous!

322
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:43,543
We need to take an ultrasound and see if the baby's
heart is beating properly, and how big it is!

323
00:23:43,544 --> 00:23:47,184
What are you doing just sitting there as the
baby's father? Hurry up and help her to stand.

324
00:23:47,784 --> 00:23:49,153
Come here. Let's go.

325
00:23:49,154 --> 00:23:50,323
Unni!

326
00:23:50,324 --> 00:23:51,413
Come out quickly.

327
00:23:51,414 --> 00:23:54,323
I don't want to!

328
00:23:54,324 --> 00:23:57,454
Unni! I said I'm okay.

329
00:24:01,274 --> 00:24:03,763
- My stomach hurts.
- What to do? Is the baby alright?

330
00:24:03,764 --> 00:24:06,843
I slightly jabbed it.

331
00:24:06,844 --> 00:24:09,723
Call 911!

332
00:24:09,724 --> 00:24:11,103
No, you can't!

333
00:24:11,104 --> 00:24:15,123
This is 911 right? There is a pregnant woman who
hurt her stomach while falling down the stairs.

334
00:24:15,124 --> 00:24:17,684
I don't have it! I said I don't have it!

335
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:21,314
What don't you have?

336
00:24:21,974 --> 00:24:24,524
There is no baby.

337
00:24:26,324 --> 00:24:27,844
What?

338
00:24:28,914 --> 00:24:32,684
I lied, I'm sorry Unni.

339
00:24:41,704 --> 00:24:45,894
What's wrong with me? I keep laughing.

340
00:24:54,964 --> 00:24:59,104
What should we do? Unni
seems to have lost it.

341
00:25:17,274 --> 00:25:19,864
Why is your face like that?

342
00:25:20,404 --> 00:25:23,284
Aren't you happy to see your
father after such a long time?

343
00:25:33,354 --> 00:25:35,243
Two course A's and...

344
00:25:35,244 --> 00:25:36,333
What are you going to have?

345
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:38,124
The B Course.

346
00:25:44,434 --> 00:25:46,313
Is work going well?

347
00:25:46,314 --> 00:25:48,513
I heard you make him do menial tasks.

348
00:25:48,514 --> 00:25:52,033
You are his older brother yet you can't
take proper care of your younger brother.

349
00:25:52,034 --> 00:25:54,623
Don't you have any connections
to give him a great job?

350
00:25:54,624 --> 00:25:57,483
No Father, it's because
I'm still not ready yet.

351
00:25:57,484 --> 00:26:02,793
If I spent all that money and sent you to study
abroad, you should at least be holding a good spot.

352
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:05,383
Instead you're giving
consultations to people.

353
00:26:05,384 --> 00:26:09,154
And getting paid a meager amount of money.
Is that what you should be doing?

354
00:26:10,734 --> 00:26:14,543
Can't you even answer?
You are so frustrating.

355
00:26:14,544 --> 00:26:17,324
You take after your mother.

356
00:26:20,144 --> 00:26:22,143
What's with that smile?

357
00:26:22,144 --> 00:26:25,553
You are saying whatever you
want about me as always.

358
00:26:25,554 --> 00:26:26,733
Hyung.

359
00:26:26,734 --> 00:26:31,193
You know that I can't eat oysters, right?
Yet, you order oysters as you please?

360
00:26:31,194 --> 00:26:33,583
Is not being able to eat oysters at
your age something to boast about?

361
00:26:33,584 --> 00:26:36,563
At your age, you shouldn't be picky about
food and be able to eat everything.

362
00:26:36,564 --> 00:26:41,803
That's what I'm saying. I'm old enough but
why are you still treating me like a child?

363
00:26:41,804 --> 00:26:45,333
How dare you argue back?

364
00:26:45,334 --> 00:26:50,563
Counseling you say? What does it matter
to you what I do? Studying abroad?

365
00:26:50,564 --> 00:26:52,773
Did you ever support me financially?

366
00:26:52,774 --> 00:26:55,183
If I hadn't given permission, do you
think you would have studied abroad?

367
00:26:55,184 --> 00:27:00,503
I studied abroad on my own with the
money I earned. You had no part in it.

368
00:27:00,504 --> 00:27:01,913
"You?"

369
00:27:01,914 --> 00:27:04,063
Hyung, what's wrong with you? Saying that to our
father whom we haven't seen in a long time.

370
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:09,553
He has to be someone I can learn something from to be a father. Just
because he has money, all he knows how to do is to put on airs.

371
00:27:09,554 --> 00:27:13,134
A person full of prejudice and
stubborness who does as he pleases.

372
00:27:13,894 --> 00:27:16,373
Now you even want to be
treated as a father?

373
00:27:16,374 --> 00:27:17,334
You punk!

374
00:27:17,335 --> 00:27:20,293
Do you know why I studied abroad?

375
00:27:20,294 --> 00:27:24,643
I wanted to escape from your
tyranny as soon as possible.

376
00:27:24,644 --> 00:27:29,504
When I was smiling, I really wasn't smiling.
Why? Because you forced me to smile.

377
00:27:34,204 --> 00:27:36,373
Eat a lot of delicious food and leave.

378
00:27:36,374 --> 00:27:40,334
You have to live a long, long life
to fulfill that greed of yours.

379
00:27:53,294 --> 00:27:55,714
Hyung, how dare you be rude?

380
00:27:57,084 --> 00:27:59,493
Did you really want to say that
to our old and feeble father?

381
00:27:59,494 --> 00:28:01,633
This is between me and father.

382
00:28:01,634 --> 00:28:06,553
Someone like you who was raised with
love has no right to say that to me.

383
00:28:06,554 --> 00:28:09,403
You're the one that pushed him out!

384
00:28:09,404 --> 00:28:15,133
Father? Fine, I don't know about him but
at least me and mom tried our best.

385
00:28:15,134 --> 00:28:20,583
We did our best to get along
with you and live well together.

386
00:28:20,584 --> 00:28:25,254
But who's the one who pushed away
a mom like that and me? It's you!

387
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:31,424
The reason our family became like this
is because of you. You did wrong.

388
00:28:49,544 --> 00:28:53,803
<i>Soo Hyun, Mom did everything wrong.</i>

389
00:28:53,804 --> 00:28:57,444
<i>What can I do to be forgiven by you?</i>

390
00:29:02,334 --> 00:29:04,113
<i>I'm so sorry, Soo Hyun!</i>

391
00:29:04,114 --> 00:29:08,084
<i>You're right and never come back again.</i>

392
00:29:25,404 --> 00:29:27,113
Hello.

393
00:29:27,114 --> 00:29:29,213
Excuse me,

394
00:29:29,214 --> 00:29:32,293
May I know which room Seo
Yeon Hee is staying at?

395
00:29:32,294 --> 00:29:35,674
Excuse me, but what is your
relationship with her?

396
00:29:46,234 --> 00:29:48,784
Forget it, I've found her.

397
00:29:51,114 --> 00:29:55,304
Hello? Oh, Son.

398
00:29:56,114 --> 00:30:01,303
<i>Mom will be back in few days.
Are you eating well?</i>

399
00:30:01,304 --> 00:30:04,943
<i>You can't just eat instant food.</i>

400
00:30:04,944 --> 00:30:09,863
There's the beef bone soup I made.
Eat that.

401
00:30:09,864 --> 00:30:13,784
Are your preparations for
the exam going well? Oh my!

402
00:30:14,974 --> 00:30:19,714
<i>That's good! Then you just have to
receive notice from one more school?</i>

403
00:30:20,874 --> 00:30:24,843
<i>That's good, my son. You got into two
schools that you wanted to attend.</i>

404
00:30:24,844 --> 00:30:27,934
Now all you need to do is
choose which one to attend.

405
00:30:31,444 --> 00:30:33,283
What should we do about Soo Hyun?

406
00:30:33,284 --> 00:30:35,243
Whether I treat him well or
console him, he gets angry.

407
00:30:35,244 --> 00:30:38,523
If I try to approach him even just a
little, he slips away like a mudfish.

408
00:30:38,524 --> 00:30:40,773
I don't know what more I can do for him.

409
00:30:40,774 --> 00:30:43,313
It will be hard.

410
00:30:43,314 --> 00:30:48,204
Professor Choi isn't an ordinary person,
because he's a psychological counselor.

411
00:30:48,904 --> 00:30:52,103
Right now, what Professor Choi needs is...

412
00:30:52,104 --> 00:30:54,893
a replay of emotions.

413
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:57,793
A replay of emotions?

414
00:30:57,794 --> 00:30:59,303
Yes.

415
00:30:59,304 --> 00:31:04,543
Professor Choi is currently looking at his
problem calmly like an audience member offstage.

416
00:31:04,544 --> 00:31:10,203
"I know all the characters and the
plot." As if he were doing an analysis.

417
00:31:10,204 --> 00:31:16,413
But, by doing that, he will never come
to a realization of his feelings.

418
00:31:16,414 --> 00:31:19,623
Then how?

419
00:31:19,624 --> 00:31:26,074
You have to put Professor Choi
on stage, as the main character.

420
00:31:58,734 --> 00:32:00,813
Where are we going?

421
00:32:00,814 --> 00:32:02,643
Today's counseling session
takes place outdoors.

422
00:32:02,644 --> 00:32:05,883
Don't you know that counseling sessions are only
once a week? And outdoor counseling sessions...

423
00:32:05,884 --> 00:32:08,423
A fortune teller's consultation
is a little different.

424
00:32:08,424 --> 00:32:14,154
Whenever I feel like it, wherever I get the feel from, no matter
how many hours it takes, I'll do it. Until I wear myself out.

425
00:32:14,754 --> 00:32:19,813
It seems you did quite a lot of research about me. You
even found the elementary school I used to attend.

426
00:32:19,814 --> 00:32:23,683
When you were in school,
what kind of kid were you?

427
00:32:23,684 --> 00:32:29,434
I was the same as other kids. I
ran around, ate, and played well.

428
00:32:33,934 --> 00:32:36,574
How was it at this time?

429
00:32:43,464 --> 00:32:48,853
<i>Soo Hyun, it would be
nice if you came for me</i>

430
00:32:48,854 --> 00:32:52,914
<i>I don't want to be here alone.</i>

431
00:32:53,804 --> 00:32:57,174
<i>Now. One, two…</i>

432
00:32:59,094 --> 00:33:02,393
<i>Choi Soo Hyun, why is your
expression like that for a picture?</i>

433
00:33:02,394 --> 00:33:06,703
<i>Were you scolded by someone?! Smile.</i>

434
00:33:06,704 --> 00:33:08,774
<i>I told you to smile more!</i>

435
00:33:10,824 --> 00:33:14,974
<i>Alright. One, two…</i>

436
00:33:16,464 --> 00:33:21,774
<i>A boy is so sullen when taking a picture.
You're such a loser.</i>

437
00:33:23,704 --> 00:33:25,593
<i>Soo Hyun, why aren't you coming?</i>

438
00:33:25,594 --> 00:33:30,153
<i>Please go ahead, I will stay
here and play for a bit.</i>

439
00:33:30,154 --> 00:33:34,123
<i>Why play outside in this cold winter?
Just come, you punk!</i>

440
00:33:34,124 --> 00:33:39,393
<i>I... I really will just
play a little more here.</i>

441
00:33:39,394 --> 00:33:41,153
<i>Soo Hyun.</i>

442
00:33:41,154 --> 00:33:46,134
<i>Do whatever you want! The kid takes after his
mother and is always doing what he wants.</i>

443
00:34:20,194 --> 00:34:22,704
Go and comfort him.

444
00:34:24,514 --> 00:34:29,764
The only person who can comfort
that child now is you.

445
00:34:39,054 --> 00:34:40,544
<i>Mom.</i>

446
00:35:33,894 --> 00:35:38,803
Doctor, when you go to Alaska,
would you like this bag or

447
00:35:38,804 --> 00:35:41,343
this one?

448
00:35:41,344 --> 00:35:42,353
This one.

449
00:35:42,354 --> 00:35:44,913
Okay, I'll order it for you.

450
00:35:44,914 --> 00:35:48,684
But I don't know if she'll be
able to go with that stamina.

451
00:35:57,724 --> 00:36:03,173
Doctor, in Alaska, if you do the Aurora tour, I think we'll
be able to see it easier. Should I sign us up for it?

452
00:36:03,174 --> 00:36:05,123
Yes, go ahead.

453
00:36:05,124 --> 00:36:09,794
But we're going quite far. Will
it be possible for her to move?

454
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,054
Doctor.

455
00:36:21,704 --> 00:36:26,914
While we're in Alaska, it will be great to
see Igloos. Should we tour them as well?

456
00:36:28,744 --> 00:36:31,453
You will say it's not
possible again, won't you?

457
00:36:31,454 --> 00:36:32,904
Yes.

458
00:36:33,584 --> 00:36:36,173
Why are you continuing to do this?

459
00:36:36,174 --> 00:36:39,244
I want to see it with you for
a long time, that's why.

460
00:36:40,984 --> 00:36:45,153
You're my mentor. Once you're my mentor,
aren't you my mentor till the end?

461
00:36:45,154 --> 00:36:50,144
For twenty years, thirty years, I want
your support, what's with just six months?

462
00:36:54,004 --> 00:36:56,613
Get the surgery, Doctor.

463
00:36:56,614 --> 00:37:01,893
Overcome the chemotherapy and build your stamina.
Go with me to see the Aurora Borealis, Peru,

464
00:37:01,894 --> 00:37:06,914
dye your hair purple, and while drinking beer
from all over the world, enjoy your life.

465
00:37:09,094 --> 00:37:13,294
Spend a long, long time with me. Okay?

466
00:37:25,794 --> 00:37:28,144
<i>Fashionably Late</i>

467
00:37:30,804 --> 00:37:35,534
10. Lie down in an Alaskan igloo
and watch the Aurora Borealis.

468
00:37:42,114 --> 00:37:45,004
<i>Bucket list ♪11.</i>

469
00:37:47,264 --> 00:37:49,534
<i>11. Get surgery.</i>

470
00:39:03,944 --> 00:39:06,974
- Are you ready?- Yes, Noona.

471
00:39:18,874 --> 00:39:20,343
What are you doing? Quickly get up.

472
00:39:20,344 --> 00:39:23,593
First, in about one month, we are going
to have our engagement party in the Cafe.

473
00:39:23,594 --> 00:39:26,593
Afterwards, we both decided that we would each put 40%
of our wages into an installment savings account.

474
00:39:26,594 --> 00:39:29,163
As for marriage, we will do it
in three years at the latest.

475
00:39:29,164 --> 00:39:31,893
Three years later? Even so,
you'll be twenty four.

476
00:39:31,894 --> 00:39:33,993
To me, age is not important.

477
00:39:33,994 --> 00:39:37,673
For Noona Yoo Rim, while she's still pretty, I want
to have her wear a wedding dress as soon as possible.

478
00:39:37,674 --> 00:39:40,553
The wedding will be the
smallest size possible.

479
00:39:40,554 --> 00:39:43,363
As for the house, we'll start with a 18
pyeong <i>(1 pyeong=3.3m2)</i> one room on a lease.

480
00:39:43,364 --> 00:39:46,473
We'll repay the debt within a year. We'll
also put money into an apartment application.

481
00:39:46,474 --> 00:39:50,313
Do you think money for an apartment application
comes out of nowhere? What about living expenses?

482
00:39:50,314 --> 00:39:53,393
What will you be doing then? Will you
keep working in the center as an intern?

483
00:39:53,394 --> 00:39:56,333
Within three years, I will make sure to get my
LCPC.<i> (Licensed Clinical Professional Counselor)</i>

484
00:39:56,334 --> 00:39:58,803
If I don't, Noona said she won't marry me.

485
00:39:58,804 --> 00:40:02,263
As soon as we marry, Ji Ho and I will
be having four separate bank accounts.

486
00:40:02,264 --> 00:40:04,593
Income, expenditure, emergency
funds, investments. Like this.

487
00:40:04,594 --> 00:40:08,873
And in case we can't earn
money, we decided to

488
00:40:08,874 --> 00:40:14,303
For starters, our ten year plan is like this.
The final objective is getting our house.

489
00:40:14,304 --> 00:40:19,874
Also, until Noona Yoo Rim becomes a documentary
director, I'll be in her films every week.

490
00:40:23,824 --> 00:40:26,544
When are you going to meet the parents?

491
00:40:29,424 --> 00:40:34,013
That is the first step in marriage, do
you think it's just between you two?

492
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:37,283
Unni! Are you finally
giving your permission?

493
00:40:37,284 --> 00:40:40,103
Thank you so much, Unni! We'll live well.

494
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:42,184
Get away, you wench.

495
00:41:02,164 --> 00:41:04,503
How is the Doctor?

496
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:07,363
She is much better than we think.

497
00:41:07,364 --> 00:41:12,634
Hyung, I'm sorry for last time.

498
00:41:13,594 --> 00:41:20,184
I forgot that my father was very harsh
on you. I'm sorry for crossing the line.

499
00:41:22,404 --> 00:41:24,054

By any chance, did she check out?

She checked out ten minutes ago.

00:47:35,944 --> 00:47:38,784
I came way too late, right?

558
00:47:44,504 --> 00:47:50,294
My birthday... did you even remember?

559
00:47:52,444 --> 00:47:53,894
Yes.

560
00:47:55,484 --> 00:48:01,034
What mother in this world would
forget her child's birthday?

561
00:48:03,524 --> 00:48:08,984
Then, what about you saying that
you'd come back on my birthday?

562
00:48:10,214 --> 00:48:12,614
Did you still remember telling me that?

563
00:48:13,304 --> 00:48:15,293
That... I...

564
00:48:15,294 --> 00:48:17,874
Why can't you remember that?

565
00:48:19,264 --> 00:48:25,404
Do you know how hard it's
been for me because of that?

566
00:48:30,284 --> 00:48:37,064
I thought you left because of me...
how much I...

567
00:48:39,084 --> 00:48:44,043
I'm sorry... Mom was wrong.

568
00:48:44,044 --> 00:48:46,254
Mom was...

569
00:48:49,664 --> 00:48:52,174
If you've separated from father,

570
00:48:55,114 --> 00:48:59,174
you should have fought to come and take me.

571
00:49:01,824 --> 00:49:06,534
How could you just leave
me with such a father?

572
00:49:07,614 --> 00:49:11,524
Was it so only you could live well?

573
00:49:14,204 --> 00:49:18,194
I had no power.

574
00:49:19,164 --> 00:49:24,764
Back then, I was kicked out,
so I didn't have anything.

575
00:49:26,354 --> 00:49:28,573
Still, I tried to do whatever I could, but

576
00:49:28,574 --> 00:49:33,803
your father's attorney was so powerful.

577
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:37,493
Everything was blamed on me. I
even got treatment for depression...

578
00:49:37,494 --> 00:49:40,384
Still, you should have come for me!

579
00:49:42,674 --> 00:49:47,384
Step-mother, younger brother and father
were living happily, except me...

580
00:49:49,244 --> 00:49:52,073
Then, you got yourself a new family...

581
00:49:52,074 --> 00:49:54,924
And I was the only one who was left alone.

582
00:49:56,844 --> 00:49:59,604
Soo Hyun.

583
00:50:03,284 --> 00:50:08,373
The fact that no one is on my
side and I'm alone in this world,

584
00:50:08,374 --> 00:50:10,653
do you know how that feels?

585
00:50:10,654 --> 00:50:15,393
It's... It's not like that now.
Starting from now,

586
00:50:15,394 --> 00:50:18,144
I'll be by your side.

587
00:50:21,354 --> 00:50:24,273
I'm sorry, Soo Hyun.

588
00:50:24,274 --> 00:50:29,474
For making you wait for thirty
years, I'm really sorry.

589
00:51:20,134 --> 00:51:24,454
It's your first round of chemotherapy.
You will be receiving this for a week.

590
00:51:39,754 --> 00:51:44,014
Doctor, I brought over movies I've
collected. Would you like to watch them?

591
00:51:44,904 --> 00:51:46,633
No, thank you.

592
00:51:46,634 --> 00:51:50,193
There are dramas too. Korean,
American and British.

593
00:51:50,194 --> 00:51:52,144
It's all right.

594
00:51:53,984 --> 00:51:57,993
Then, how about a performance?
Choi Seung Chan's live.

595
00:51:57,994 --> 00:52:01,373
Well, I guess it's not live. In
any case, it's a performance.

00:53:24,654 --> 00:53:26,833
Oh, Ji Ho. What is Soo Hyun doing?

608
00:53:26,834 --> 00:53:29,633
Claire came so they're working together.

609
00:53:29,634 --> 00:53:31,213
Clarie came again?

610
00:53:31,214 --> 00:53:34,594
Yes. They said they're going to stay up all
night because they have a lot of work.

611
00:53:44,344 --> 00:53:51,363
That rascal never eats with me.
She always eats with that guy.

612
00:53:51,364 --> 00:53:54,003
Still, I heard you become very close.

613
00:53:54,004 --> 00:53:59,444
But, why are you meeting that type of guy?

614
00:53:59,454 --> 00:54:00,274
Excuse me?

615
00:54:00,275 --> 00:54:05,983
I heard everything through Secretary Lee.
You're dating Choi Soo Hyun?

616
00:54:05,984 --> 00:54:08,553
Ah, yes.

617
00:54:08,554 --> 00:54:11,603
No wonder.

618
00:54:11,604 --> 00:54:16,653
I should've known when you asked me to give him
the penalty of receiving counseling from you.

619
00:54:16,654 --> 00:54:20,933
But, do you two see eye to eye?

620
00:54:20,934 --> 00:54:25,203
Choi Soo Hyun is rather rude.

621
00:54:25,204 --> 00:54:27,803
Is he affectionate towards you?

622
00:54:27,804 --> 00:54:30,403
These days, he's become too
affectionate that it's a problem.

623
00:54:30,404 --> 00:54:34,683
I fixed him through counseling sessions and he seems to
have gained confidence about being able to love now.

624
00:54:34,684 --> 00:54:38,063
He's nice to every woman.

625
00:54:38,064 --> 00:54:40,653
Today, this woman named Claire...

626
00:54:40,654 --> 00:54:42,313
Cl... What?

627
00:54:42,314 --> 00:54:47,854
Chairman, when you were dating
your wife, you had a rival, right?

628
00:54:48,654 --> 00:54:49,594
How did you know that?

629
00:54:49,595 --> 00:54:51,833
I saw all of your love letters...

630
00:54:51,834 --> 00:54:55,043
It's a spiritual message.

631
00:54:55,044 --> 00:54:58,823
But how did you get rid of your rival?

632
00:54:58,824 --> 00:55:02,284
Did you hang onto him?

633
00:55:05,014 --> 00:55:10,023
Love will follow the one who loves.

634
00:55:10,024 --> 00:55:12,813
Don't be dispassionate.

635
00:55:12,814 --> 00:55:17,114
Love will find a way.

636
00:55:18,874 --> 00:55:20,514
Eat your meal.

637
00:55:21,754 --> 00:55:25,523
Thank you for helping me out with my work.
It's been a lot of help.

638
00:55:25,524 --> 00:55:29,863
It's nothing. I only did a
few written consultations.

639
00:55:29,864 --> 00:55:32,843
Are you going back now? What about a car?
Did you take a taxi?

640
00:55:32,844 --> 00:55:35,783
Yeah. I was thinking of going
straight to the airport.

641
00:55:35,784 --> 00:55:38,503
There aren't any taxis you
can catch here though.

642
00:55:38,504 --> 00:55:41,164
Let's go. I'll take you to the airport.

643
00:56:00,304 --> 00:56:03,363
Hye Rim, I was just going to take Claire.

644
00:56:03,364 --> 00:56:05,133
Claire is going back to the States, so...

645
00:56:05,134 --> 00:56:07,434
Did anyone ask?

646
00:56:23,084 --> 00:56:25,934
Unni, what's wrong? Did something happen?

647
00:56:30,614 --> 00:56:35,074
Yoo Rim, why am I always like this?

648
00:56:35,854 --> 00:56:38,353
What are you talking about?

649
00:56:38,354 --> 00:56:43,034
Now I feel like I'm going
to lose Soo Hyun, too.

650
00:56:43,744 --> 00:56:46,424
I'm so uneasy.

651
00:57:07,234 --> 00:57:10,794
[Stage three]: A very demanding task that can
be perceived as out of the norm by society.

652
00:57:13,804 --> 00:57:18,604
[Stage three task]:

653
00:57:33,074 --> 00:57:36,994
<i>You'll need this when you drive.</i>

654
00:57:43,584 --> 00:57:45,384
<i>Welcome.</i>

655
00:57:47,164 --> 00:57:49,403
Please give me the same design as this.

656
00:57:49,404 --> 00:57:51,124
Yes.

657
00:58:09,124 --> 00:58:12,564
<i>Movie Box</i>

658
00:58:16,614 --> 00:58:17,853
He's doing this crap again!

659
00:58:17,854 --> 00:58:19,633
Do you think I'm going to get fooled again?

660
00:58:19,634 --> 00:58:22,614
Are you crazy? I'll never go!

661
00:58:49,894 --> 00:58:52,593
Oh, there's a person sitting here.

662
00:58:52,594 --> 00:58:53,863
I don't think so.

663
00:58:53,864 --> 00:58:57,414
Row G, seat 26. It's correct.

664
00:59:11,254 --> 00:59:16,573
Audience members, during the show, ringing cell
phones and light from your cell phone's screens

665
00:59:16,574 --> 00:59:21,293
can really disturb another audience member.

666
00:59:21,294 --> 00:59:27,073
We who have survived broken hearts and despair,
in order to see hope through this movie,

667
00:59:27,074 --> 00:59:31,174
please make sure to turn off
your cameras and cell phones.

668
00:59:32,034 --> 00:59:36,093
Don't kick the seat in front of you and
please place napkins in the trashcan.

669
00:59:36,094 --> 00:59:40,103
In case of a fire, please use the
emergency exit on this side.

670
00:59:40,104 --> 00:59:44,913
The restroom is around
the corner on the left.

671
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:46,674
And...

672
00:59:49,394 --> 00:59:51,814
to the woman in row G, seat 25.

673
00:59:56,134 --> 01:00:03,533
To me, more than anyone in this world, the
woman in row G, seat 25 is precious to me.

674
01:00:03,534 --> 01:00:08,633
The one who took me out of my emotional
scar was the one in row G, seat 25.

675
01:00:08,634 --> 01:00:12,354
The one who also made me examine myself
was also the one in row G, seat 25.

676
01:00:13,624 --> 01:00:16,503
"So that's why I have to change."

677
01:00:16,504 --> 01:00:21,033
"I have to become cooler", the one who also
made me think of this is in row G, seat 25.

678
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:23,664
Awww...

679
01:00:27,854 --> 01:00:29,934
I love you, Hye Rim.

680
01:00:56,694 --> 01:00:58,453
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

681
01:00:58,454 --> 01:01:00,734
Yes, I'm crazy.

682
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:04,653
- How was my task for stage three
of the experiment? -What?

683
01:01:04,654 --> 01:01:09,053
Just now, I did the third task for stage three
of the psychological love experiment for you.

684
01:01:09,054 --> 01:01:11,573
It's a task where I must endure the
inappropriate stares of people around me

685
01:01:11,574 --> 01:01:14,794
to the degree that I might
appear to be crazy.

686
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:20,924
It's evidence that I've totally
fallen in love with you.

687
01:01:22,724 --> 01:01:26,423
Till the very end, that damn experiment.
It's always that experiment.

688
01:01:26,424 --> 01:01:28,334
I love you, Hye Rim.
