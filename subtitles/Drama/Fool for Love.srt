# Listen to me, woman

00:02:59,144 --> 00:03:00,686
# Listen to me

3
00:03:00,812 --> 00:03:03,729
# I want you to understand

4
00:03:21,499 --> 00:03:24,073
.. country KAFH...

5
00:03:32,552 --> 00:03:36,763
# Come on, baby, let's ride

6
00:03:39,851 --> 00:03:46,352
# I can hear the sound
of your headlights on the ground

7
00:03:46,483 --> 00:03:48,689
# Looking for me

8
00:03:51,946 --> 00:03:56,904
It's 70 degrees...
- # Make new plans for the kitchen too...

9
00:03:59,078 --> 00:04:01,866
# Make me smell the sweat

10
00:04:01,998 --> 00:04:07,871
# On the red leather seat...

11
00:04:09,923 --> 00:04:13,339
# Come on, baby, let's ride

12
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,505
# Come on, baby, let's ride

13
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:22,340
# Slide on into your four-wheel drive

# Let's ride

15
00:04:29,776 --> 00:04:33,774
# Let me feel you moving with the moon

16
00:04:33,905 --> 00:04:39,409
# Like the storming desert rain

17
00:04:40,829 --> 00:04:44,198
# Come on, baby, let's ride

18
00:04:47,836 --> 00:04:52,462
# Let me see the eyes that you hide

19
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:56,540
# Under your hair

20
00:04:58,763 --> 00:05:03,010
# Come on, baby, let's ride

21
00:05:04,477 --> 00:05:07,478
# Come on, baby, let's ride

00:05:16,448 --> 00:05:18,606

00:05:30,753 --> 00:05:32,378
# Let's ride

27
00:05:59,991 --> 00:06:02,945
# Listen to me, woman

28
00:06:03,077 --> 00:06:04,572
# Listen to me

29
00:06:04,704 --> 00:06:07,160
# I want you to understand

30
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:11,626
Mr Valdes? I'm locking up.

31
00:06:11,753 --> 00:06:14,505
I'll put the laundry in your car.

32
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,485
# Come on, baby, let's ride

33
00:06:46,371 --> 00:06:49,621
# Come on, baby, let's ride

34
00:06:49,749 --> 00:06:53,332
# Slide on into your four-wheel drive

35
00:06:54,796 --> 00:06:57,287
# Let's ride

36
00:06:58,383 --> 00:07:00,257
# Let's ride

37
00:07:02,095 --> 00:07:04,134
# Let's ride

38
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:08,089
# Let's ride

39
00:08:40,735 --> 00:08:42,775
Hey! Anybody?

40
00:11:51,843 --> 00:11:54,132
Move.

41
00:11:54,262 --> 00:11:56,302
Move!

42
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,989
You gonna do the laundry now?

43
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:30,501
- You don't have to do the laundry for me.
- How'd you find me?

44
00:12:30,632 --> 00:12:33,253
I saw the old Chevy layin' tits-up out there.

45
00:12:33,384 --> 00:12:36,718
I figured you died in a car crash
or you settled in for a while.

46
00:12:36,846 --> 00:12:40,013
- Wouldn't make much difference to you.
- What's that?

47
00:12:40,141 --> 00:12:42,181
If I died in some car crash.

48
00:12:44,062 --> 00:12:48,640
I knew I shoulda had 'em burn
that damn thing. Or bury it.

49
00:12:48,775 --> 00:12:54,196
You'd have gone right past
if it hadn't been for that car, right?

50
00:12:54,322 --> 00:12:56,611
I'd have found you one way or the other.

51
00:13:04,749 --> 00:13:06,457
Eddie.

52
00:13:09,045 --> 00:13:12,628
You want me
to take those sheets for you?

53
00:13:12,757 --> 00:13:15,794
I've been doin' my own laundry
for months now.

54
00:13:15,927 --> 00:13:18,679
I'm real good at it.

55
00:13:18,805 --> 00:13:21,889
You just plunk the old quarters in
and let it rip.

56
00:13:24,602 --> 00:13:26,725
Come on, honey, let me do your laundry.

57
00:13:26,855 --> 00:13:29,809
- You wanna do my laundry?
- Hey! Whoa, whoa!

58
00:13:29,941 --> 00:13:31,934
- Son of a bitch!
- Hey! Whoa!

59
00:13:32,068 --> 00:13:34,310
Do you do her laundry?

60
00:14:03,308 --> 00:14:06,759
You want an aspirin or somethin', huh?

61
00:14:08,521 --> 00:14:10,810
You got a headache?

62
00:14:13,568 --> 00:14:16,024
You want some water?

63
00:14:20,909 --> 00:14:23,067
May.

64
00:14:23,203 --> 00:14:25,491
May, come on.

65
00:14:25,622 --> 00:14:27,199
Honey?

66
00:14:29,042 --> 00:14:33,086
You want me to make you
some hot tea or somethin'?

67
00:14:33,213 --> 00:14:37,590
You want some tea?
I'll make you some tea like I used to, OK?

68
00:14:37,717 --> 00:14:39,757
With lemon?

69
00:14:45,016 --> 00:14:48,385
You want some Ovaltine? May...

70
00:14:49,479 --> 00:14:53,263
May, you gotta let go of me now, OK?
Honey.

71
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,817
You want me to go, huh?

72
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:07,157
- What do you want, then?
- You smell.

73
00:15:07,831 --> 00:15:10,119
Your fingers smell.

74
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:13,001
- Horses.
- Pussy.

75
00:15:13,128 --> 00:15:16,662
- Oh, come on, May!
- They do. They smell like metal.

76
00:15:16,798 --> 00:15:19,336
I am not gonna start this shit.

77
00:15:20,635 --> 00:15:22,462
Rich pussy.

78
00:15:23,596 --> 00:15:27,261
- Very clean pussy.
- I came to see if you were all right.

79
00:15:27,392 --> 00:15:31,686
- I don't need you.
- Oh? OK. Good. Great.

80
00:15:34,107 --> 00:15:36,776
What the hell are you doing in that truck?

81
00:15:41,865 --> 00:15:45,150
- Eddie, don't go!
- Get outta here!

82
00:15:49,038 --> 00:15:52,573
God damn... What kinda dump is this?

83
00:15:54,794 --> 00:15:57,332
You live here?

84
00:16:11,102 --> 00:16:14,637
What am I gonna do?
What am I supposed to do now?

85
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:18,814
What?

86
00:16:22,363 --> 00:16:24,403
Oh, shit.

87
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:31,410
You're gonna erase me.

88
00:16:31,539 --> 00:16:34,113
What are you talkin' about?

89
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:41,583
You're gonna erase me. You're
gonna erase me or have me erased.

90
00:16:41,716 --> 00:16:44,670
Why would I want... Are you crazy?

91
00:16:45,762 --> 00:16:48,679
- Cos I'm in the way.
- Whoa, May.

92
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:52,092
- Don't talk like that.
- I am.

93
00:16:52,227 --> 00:16:56,094
May, I am tryin' to take care of you,
all right?

94
00:16:56,231 --> 00:16:59,101
Sure you are !

95
00:17:00,276 --> 00:17:03,028
Get back. Come on, back.

96
00:17:03,154 --> 00:17:05,396
You're just guilty.

97
00:17:06,616 --> 00:17:11,527
- You're gutless and you're guilty.
- That's real cute. Great. Gutless.

98
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:15,874
- What are you doing with these horses?
- I'm unloading them.

99
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,954
Haven't been out of this rig in 200 miles.

100
00:17:19,087 --> 00:17:22,871
Even my horses
have to suffer because of you.

101
00:17:26,344 --> 00:17:28,835
- I'm gonna kill her.
- Who?

102
00:17:30,557 --> 00:17:33,842
- Who?
- Don't talk like that, will ya?

103
00:17:33,977 --> 00:17:39,137
I am. I'm gonna kill her
and then I'm gonna kill you.

104
00:17:39,274 --> 00:17:41,313
You're scaring me to death.

105
00:17:42,485 --> 00:17:48,155
- Back up. Get back.
- Two very sharp knives.

106
00:17:48,283 --> 00:17:52,197
Two separate knives.
One for you and one for her.

107
00:17:52,328 --> 00:17:54,368
So the blood don't mix.

108
00:17:55,290 --> 00:18:00,913
Do you know what I'm gonna do
to her first? I'm gonna torture her.

109
00:18:01,045 --> 00:18:03,252
- Do you hear me?
- Uh-huh.

110
00:18:03,381 --> 00:18:07,461
- I'm gonna torture her first.
- Oh, great.

111
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:13,468
- Not you. I'm gonna let you have it.
- Thanks.

112
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,639
That's right.

113
00:18:15,769 --> 00:18:22,352
Probably in the midst of a kiss, after
you think everything's been healed up.

114
00:18:22,484 --> 00:18:25,734
Right when you think
you've buffaloed me again.

115
00:18:26,488 --> 00:18:29,239
That's right when you die.

116
00:18:31,326 --> 00:18:35,158
You know how many miles I went
out of my way to come and see you?

117
00:18:35,288 --> 00:18:38,040
- Nobody asked you to come here!
- 2,482.

118
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:42,211
- Where you been, Katmandu?
- 2,482 miles!

119
00:18:42,337 --> 00:18:44,376
So what?

120
00:20:11,926 --> 00:20:13,966
I missed you, you know.

121
00:20:20,059 --> 00:20:22,099
I did.

122
00:20:23,354 --> 00:20:27,483
More than anything
I ever missed in my whole life.

123
00:20:27,609 --> 00:20:32,069
Kept thinkin' about you
the whole time I was driving.

124
00:20:33,156 --> 00:20:35,279
I kept seeing you.

125
00:20:39,287 --> 00:20:41,327
Sometimes just a part of you.

126
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:46,711
Yeah? Like which part?

127
00:20:46,836 --> 00:20:50,419
- Your neck.
- My neck?

128
00:20:50,548 --> 00:20:53,086
- Yeah.
- You missed my neck?

129
00:20:54,052 --> 00:21:02,806
Yeah. Well, I missed all of you, but... your
neck kept comin' up for some reason.

130
00:21:02,936 --> 00:21:05,605
- I kept cryin' about your neck.
- You were cryin'?

131
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:07,806
- Yeah.
- Crying?

132
00:21:08,441 --> 00:21:09,437
Yeah.

133
00:21:11,736 --> 00:21:14,654
Was this before or after
your fling with the countess?

134
00:21:14,781 --> 00:21:18,399
There wasn't any fling with any countess.

135
00:21:18,535 --> 00:21:20,942
- You're a liar.
- I took her to dinner once.

136
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:23,748
- You're a liar.
- OK, twice.

137
00:21:23,873 --> 00:21:28,831
You were bumpin' on a regular basis.
Don't stand there and give me this shit.

138
00:21:36,052 --> 00:21:42,055
- I'm takin' you back, May.
- Back to that idiot trailer? Oh, no.

139
00:21:42,183 --> 00:21:47,094
No, I'm movin'. I got a piece of ground
up in Wyoming now.

140
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:49,270
- Wyoming?
- Yeah.

141
00:21:49,399 --> 00:21:51,475
I'm not goin' to Wyoming.

142
00:21:51,609 --> 00:21:54,859
What's up there?
Marlboro Man or somethin'?

143
00:21:54,988 --> 00:21:58,238
- Well, you can't stay here.
- Why not?

144
00:21:58,366 --> 00:22:01,984
Why not? I'm a regular citizen now.

145
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,445
And I got me a job.

146
00:22:07,709 --> 00:22:10,710
You got a job?

147
00:22:10,837 --> 00:22:14,170
That's right.
You think I'm helpless or somethin'?

148
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:16,457
That's what you think, right?

149
00:22:16,593 --> 00:22:19,380
- Yeah, it is.
- No, I just...

150
00:22:19,512 --> 00:22:22,632
Been a long time since you had a job.

151
00:22:26,436 --> 00:22:29,390
Well, I'm a cook.

152
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,569
A cook?
You can't even flip an egg, can you?

153
00:22:36,237 --> 00:22:39,024
- I'm not talkin' to you any more.
- May!

154
00:22:39,157 --> 00:22:43,866
May! Goddammit!
Quit doin' this, will ya?

155
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:48,953
I got it all worked out now.
I been thinkin' about this for weeks.

156
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:54,588
I'll build a corral for the horses. We can
have a vegetable garden and chickens.

157
00:22:54,714 --> 00:22:56,588
I hate chickens.

158
00:22:57,717 --> 00:23:01,585
I hate horses
and I hate all that other shit too.

159
00:23:01,721 --> 00:23:04,805
You have me confused
with somebody else, don't ya?

160
00:23:04,933 --> 00:23:07,803
Unbelievable!

161
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:17,277
I'm not lettin' go of you this time, May.

162
00:23:17,403 --> 00:23:20,737
You never had me to begin with, Eddie.

163
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:27,203
You keep comin' up with
this lame country dream,

164
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:30,781
life in the country,
vegetables and chickens and stuff.

165
00:23:30,917 --> 00:23:35,330
I hate all that stuff.
It makes me puke to even think about it.

166
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:47,004
What do you think it's like sitting in a tin
trailer waiting for the butane to arrive?

167
00:23:47,142 --> 00:23:50,593
Then hiking down the Laundromat.
You think that's thrilling?

168
00:23:50,728 --> 00:23:53,350
What?

169
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:17,957
- Get outta here, Eddie.

170
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:20,212
Turn off this goddamn thing.

171
00:24:20,341 --> 00:24:24,838
Don't touch me.
Now get outta here. Dammit.

172
00:24:31,352 --> 00:24:34,852
Couldn't you just stay put?
I told you I was comin' back to get you.

173
00:24:34,981 --> 00:24:38,599
I bought you all them magazines.
I thought you liked that.

174
00:24:38,735 --> 00:24:42,020
- Those French kinds.
- Oh, God.

175
00:24:42,155 --> 00:24:45,571
Yeah. I did. You're right.

176
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:48,736
I especially liked the one
with the countess on the cover.

177
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:51,622
That was real cute.

178
00:24:52,248 --> 00:24:54,537
I liked that one a lot.

179
00:25:01,841 --> 00:25:04,000
All right.

180
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:06,840
All right what?

181
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:17,021
- Where are you goin'?
- I'm gonna sleep in the truck.

182
00:25:26,032 --> 00:25:31,572
- You're gonna spend the night?
- I'll be gone in the morning.

183
00:25:31,704 --> 00:25:38,454
# He was branded by the Wyoming wind

184
00:25:38,586 --> 00:25:43,414
# He belongs to her until he dies

185
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:46,883
No. Wait.

186
00:25:48,263 --> 00:25:51,679
#... from the Laramie river

187
00:25:51,808 --> 00:25:58,345
# And his heartbeat's Cheyenne

188
00:25:58,481 --> 00:26:03,820
# Why, oh, Wyoming

189
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:10,699
# You make me wonder why

190
00:26:11,786 --> 00:26:17,741
# Why, oh, Wyoming

191
00:26:18,501 --> 00:26:23,496
# Why?

192
00:26:51,785 --> 00:26:54,240
# She liked the crowds

193
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:57,953
# He looked up in the clouds

194
00:26:58,082 --> 00:27:03,290
# So they never saw eye to eye

195
00:27:03,963 --> 00:27:07,831
# She had her magazine dreams

196
00:27:07,967 --> 00:27:10,885
# Of faraway scenes

197
00:27:11,012 --> 00:27:18,094
# And he had the Wyoming sky

198
00:27:18,228 --> 00:27:23,269
# Why, oh, Wyoming

199
00:27:24,734 --> 00:27:29,230
# You make me wonder why

200
00:27:31,491 --> 00:27:37,161
# Why, oh, Wyoming

201
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:43,661
# Why?

202
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:50,216
# Why, oh, Wyoming

203
00:27:51,302 --> 00:27:57,672
# You make me wonder why

204
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:02,720
# Why, oh, Wyoming

205
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:10,816
# Why?

206
00:28:10,947 --> 00:28:16,570
# Why, oh, Wyoming

207
00:28:17,704 --> 00:28:24,323
# You make me wonder why

208
00:28:24,461 --> 00:28:29,621
# Why, oh, Wyoming

209
00:28:30,717 --> 00:28:36,091
# Why?

210
00:28:53,406 --> 00:28:58,531
You can take it.
You're a stunt man. Right?

211
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:48,458
- You got any tequila?
- You already drank my tequila!

212
00:29:53,383 --> 00:29:58,804
- Come on, I wanna show you somethin'.
- I'm in the middle of somethin' here.

213
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:02,465
- I'm tryin' to talk to somebody.
- Show you something.

214
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,352
Look at that.

215
00:30:05,478 --> 00:30:07,518
Remember that?

216
00:30:08,857 --> 00:30:12,391
- Where'd you get this?

217
00:30:14,863 --> 00:30:17,270
Take a look at that picture over there.

218
00:30:17,407 --> 00:30:21,155
- You know who that is?
- I'm not sure.

219
00:30:25,665 --> 00:30:27,823
It's Barbara Mandrell.

220
00:30:29,586 --> 00:30:32,456
That's who that is. Barbara Mandrell.

221
00:30:32,589 --> 00:30:34,795
You heard of her?

222
00:30:36,509 --> 00:30:38,003
Yeah, sure.

223
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:42,922
Would you believe me
if I told you I was married to her?

224
00:30:43,057 --> 00:30:45,097
- No.
- Uh-huh.

225
00:30:45,226 --> 00:30:48,227
You see, that's the difference right there.

226
00:30:48,688 --> 00:30:52,555
I'm actually married to Barbara Mandrell
in my mind.

227
00:30:52,692 --> 00:30:55,479
Can you understand that?

228
00:30:55,612 --> 00:30:59,111
- Yeah, sure.
- Oh, good.

229
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,529
I'm glad we have an understanding.

230
00:31:57,048 --> 00:32:00,583
I swear to God
I didn't hate you even more.

231
00:32:04,264 --> 00:32:08,178
It just grows. Just grows and grows.

232
00:32:08,309 --> 00:32:13,102
But I mean to see you no more.
See you no more.

233
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:16,434
Just to see a picture of you.
No, not just you.

234
00:32:16,568 --> 00:32:20,067
I've seen a picture of you and her,
that bitch.

235
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:56,183
I don't understand how I could hate you
so much after so much time.

236
00:32:58,067 --> 00:33:01,104
I don't remember
how much I'd like to hate you.

237
00:33:01,237 --> 00:33:04,606
I hate you even more. That's right.

238
00:33:04,741 --> 00:33:09,367
I hate you even more
and all it does is just grow.

239
00:33:09,996 --> 00:33:12,404
If I see you in the morning...

240
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:15,114
See a picture of you...

241
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:19,666
Of you and that bitch.

242
00:33:28,056 --> 00:33:30,594
I don't care.

243
00:33:40,652 --> 00:33:43,024
It just invades my head.

244
00:33:43,905 --> 00:33:47,440
It invades my head all the time.

245
00:33:47,575 --> 00:33:51,490
Bet you love that, don't you?

246
00:33:56,334 --> 00:34:00,083
This picture stings me more
than seeing you with her.

247
00:34:02,757 --> 00:34:04,916
It stings me more.

248
00:34:06,136 --> 00:34:09,136
And it cuts me. Always cuts me.

249
00:34:09,973 --> 00:34:12,012
Cuts me up.

250
00:34:12,976 --> 00:34:16,641
Cuts me...

251
00:34:16,771 --> 00:34:19,558
And he kinda just comes...

252
00:34:19,691 --> 00:34:24,436
Uninvited, like.

253
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:30,819
Right when I don't expect it.
Like a little torture.

254
00:34:30,952 --> 00:34:33,241
Like a little torture.

255
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:35,411
I blame you more. I do.

256
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:41,578
I blame you more for this torture
than I actually do for what you did.

257
00:34:43,006 --> 00:34:46,706
If you love her, I could kill you.

258
00:34:46,843 --> 00:34:49,168
If I really wanted to, I could.

259
00:34:49,304 --> 00:34:51,795
I don't care
that much about you to kill you.

260
00:34:54,642 --> 00:34:57,513
You forgot your sweater.

261
00:35:06,988 --> 00:35:10,191
You better go.
It's better that you go right now.

262
00:35:10,325 --> 00:35:15,117
- I wish you'd make up your mind...
- I got somebody comin' here to get me.

263
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:17,286
Here?

264
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:20,950
Yeah, here.
Where you think they're gonna go?

265
00:35:21,085 --> 00:35:24,039
- Who you been seein'?
- Don't you come near me!

266
00:35:24,172 --> 00:35:26,710
Don't you even think about it.

267
00:35:49,072 --> 00:35:52,690
This time... Makes me so sick...

268
00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:24,433
# Low down leaving sun, I've done

269
00:36:24,566 --> 00:36:27,816
# Did everything that needs done

270
00:36:28,611 --> 00:36:30,734
# But woe is me

271
00:36:30,864 --> 00:36:32,940
# Why can't I see?

272
00:36:33,074 --> 00:36:37,570
# I'd best be leaving well enough alone

273
00:36:37,704 --> 00:36:39,743
# Them neon light nights

274
00:36:39,873 --> 00:36:42,328
# Couldn't stay out of fights

275
00:36:42,459 --> 00:36:46,503
# Keep a-haunting me in memories

276
00:36:46,629 --> 00:36:48,955
# Well, there's one in every crowd

277
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:51,415
# For crying out loud

278
00:36:51,551 --> 00:36:55,299
# Why was it always turning out to be me?

279
00:36:56,222 --> 00:36:58,262
# Where does it go?

280
00:36:58,391 --> 00:37:00,431
# The good Lord only knows

281
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,727
# Seems like it was just the other day

282
00:37:05,023 --> 00:37:07,062
# I was down at Green Gables

283
00:37:07,192 --> 00:37:09,480
# A-hawking them tables

284
00:37:09,611 --> 00:37:13,359
# And generally blowing
all my hard-earned pay

285
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,363
# Piano rolled blues

286
00:37:16,493 --> 00:37:18,651
# Danced holes in my shoes

287
00:37:18,787 --> 00:37:23,164
# There weren't another other way to be

288
00:37:23,291 --> 00:37:27,668
# For lovable losers, no-account boozers

289
00:37:27,796 --> 00:37:32,292
# And honky tonk heroes like me

290
00:37:32,425 --> 00:37:34,714
Hey, hey.

291
00:37:40,183 --> 00:37:42,389
# Where does it go?

292
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:44,595
# The good Lord only knows

293
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:48,643
# Seems like it was just the other day

294
00:38:03,957 --> 00:38:05,996
You got any glasses?

295
00:38:07,919 --> 00:38:10,540
They're in the bathroom.

296
00:38:10,672 --> 00:38:14,041
- What they doing in the bathroom?
- I keep everything there.

297
00:38:14,175 --> 00:38:17,710
- It's safer.
- Where are the damn glasses?

298
00:38:17,846 --> 00:38:21,215
- In the medicine cabinet.
- What are they doing there?

299
00:38:22,434 --> 00:38:26,134
There are no germs
in the medicine cabinet.

300
00:38:26,271 --> 00:38:29,058
Oh, germs. Germs.

301
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:31,681
Germs.

302
00:38:31,818 --> 00:38:34,107
- Germs.
- That's right.

303
00:38:34,237 --> 00:38:36,277
Do you want some of this?

304
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:39,029
No. I'm on the wagon.

305
00:38:40,118 --> 00:38:43,451
- Good. It's about time.

306
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:24,526
- I have returned.

307
00:39:51,064 --> 00:39:57,434
- Wait a minute. I'm not that kind of a guy.
- Oh, you know you are.

308
00:40:03,827 --> 00:40:06,697
Not on the first date.

309
00:40:15,588 --> 00:40:19,123
# With a trembling hand and a bottle of gin

310
00:40:19,259 --> 00:40:22,509
# And a rose of a different name

311
00:40:24,139 --> 00:40:27,638
# The devil made me do it the first time

312
00:40:27,767 --> 00:40:31,101
# The second time I done it on my own

313
00:40:31,229 --> 00:40:34,563
# Lord, put a handle
on a simple-handed man

314
00:40:34,691 --> 00:40:38,190
# And help him leave that black rose alone

315
00:40:55,503 --> 00:40:58,706
# When the devil made that woman

316
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:02,209
# Lord, he threw the pattern away

317
00:41:02,343 --> 00:41:05,629
# She was built for speed
with the tools you need

318
00:41:05,763 --> 00:41:09,097
# To make a new fool every day

319
00:41:11,561 --> 00:41:14,348
# Way down deep and dirty

320
00:41:14,481 --> 00:41:17,684
# On the darker side of shame

321
00:41:17,817 --> 00:41:21,601
# I caught a cane-cutting man
and a bottle of gin

322
00:41:21,738 --> 00:41:24,941
# With a rose of a different name

323
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:30,445
# The devil made me do it the first time

324
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:34,115
# The second time I done it on my own

325
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:37,168
# Lord, put a handle
on a simple-handed man

326
00:41:37,295 --> 00:41:40,581
# And help him leave that black rose alone

327
00:41:42,592 --> 00:41:46,043
# The devil made me do it the first time

328
00:41:46,179 --> 00:41:49,049
# The second time I done it on my own

329
00:41:49,724 --> 00:41:52,808
# Lord, put a handle
on a simple-handed man

330
00:41:52,936 --> 00:41:56,554
# And help him leave that black rose alone

331
00:42:10,954 --> 00:42:13,824
- What are you gonna do with that?
- Clean it.

332
00:42:21,381 --> 00:42:24,547
Eddie, this is a very friendly person
comin' here.

333
00:42:24,676 --> 00:42:26,799
He's not malicious in any way.

334
00:42:28,346 --> 00:42:31,632
- Did you hear what I said?
- About what?

335
00:42:35,979 --> 00:42:39,893
- About the man who's comin' here.
- What man?

336
00:42:43,403 --> 00:42:45,645
First off, it can't be very serious.

337
00:42:47,407 --> 00:42:50,906
- Oh, really? And why is that?
- Cos you call him a man.

338
00:42:54,414 --> 00:42:56,952
- What am I supposed to call him?
- A guy.

339
00:42:57,083 --> 00:42:59,539
If you called him a guy, I'd be worried.

340
00:42:59,669 --> 00:43:02,789
Since you call him a man,
you give yourself away.

341
00:43:02,922 --> 00:43:07,335
You're in a dumb situation with this guy
by callin' him a man.

342
00:43:07,469 --> 00:43:13,174
- You put yourself below him.
- What the hell do you know about it?

343
00:43:13,308 --> 00:43:18,266
Anybody who don't kill himself
by fallin' off horses and ridin' steers

344
00:43:18,396 --> 00:43:21,812
- is a twerp in your book, isn't that right?
- Yeah, that is right.

345
00:43:21,941 --> 00:43:24,267
What are you supposed to call yourself?

346
00:43:24,402 --> 00:43:28,186
You supposed to call yourself a guy
or call yourself a man?

347
00:43:28,323 --> 00:43:31,608
If you ain't a cowboy, you ain't shit.

348
00:43:31,743 --> 00:43:35,741
- Why's everything a contest with you?

349
00:43:35,872 --> 00:43:38,789
He's not competing with you.
He doesn't know you exist.

350
00:43:38,917 --> 00:43:42,784
- You can introduce me.
- You can't keep messing me around.

351
00:43:42,921 --> 00:43:47,168
You have no right to be jealous of me.
Not after all the bullshit I've been through.

352
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:52,887
- We got a pact. Remember that?
- We haven't got anything any more.

353
00:43:53,014 --> 00:43:56,217
Is that right?
How come you're so excited?

354
00:43:56,351 --> 00:44:01,511
- I'm not excited!
- Yeah, you are. You're beside yourself.

355
00:44:01,648 --> 00:44:04,649
You're drivin' me crazy, that's why.

356
00:44:04,776 --> 00:44:07,349
You know we're connected, May.

357
00:44:07,487 --> 00:44:12,398
We'll always be connected.
That was decided a long time ago.

358
00:44:12,534 --> 00:44:15,404
Nothing was decided, Eddie.
You screwed up.

359
00:44:15,537 --> 00:44:19,997
- You know what happened.
- You promised me that.

360
00:44:20,125 --> 00:44:22,960
You promised
you'd never bring that up again.

361
00:44:23,086 --> 00:44:25,838
A promise can't stop that. It happened.

362
00:44:25,964 --> 00:44:29,796
- Nothing happened, Eddie!
- Innocent to the last drop.

363
00:44:29,926 --> 00:44:31,966
Nothing happened!

364
00:44:32,095 --> 00:44:36,223
- You're a traitor.
- Eddie, nothing ever happened!

365
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:39,556
Eddie!

366
00:44:42,647 --> 00:44:44,687
Eddie!

367
00:46:22,205 --> 00:46:24,244
Baby?

368
00:47:36,404 --> 00:47:38,776
You know something, honey?

369
00:47:39,866 --> 00:47:41,989
There is one thing I'll never forget.

370
00:47:43,745 --> 00:47:45,903
I'll never forget this as long as I live.

371
00:47:49,959 --> 00:47:54,456
I don't even know
why I remember it exactly.

372
00:47:54,589 --> 00:47:58,836
But you and me and your mother

373
00:48:00,011 --> 00:48:05,765
were drivin' through southern Utah once,
I think it was,

374
00:48:06,351 --> 00:48:08,390
in that old Plymouth we had.

375
00:48:09,604 --> 00:48:14,515
You remember that Plym?
It had a white plastic hood.

376
00:48:14,651 --> 00:48:17,984
A replica of the Mayflower, I think it was.

377
00:48:38,049 --> 00:48:40,836
Well, it was some kind of ship.

378
00:48:40,969 --> 00:48:43,970
Anyway, we'd been drivin' all night

379
00:48:44,097 --> 00:48:48,095
and you were sound asleep
in the back seat

380
00:48:48,226 --> 00:48:51,346
and your momma was sound asleep
in the front.

381
00:48:51,479 --> 00:48:56,640
# You lied your way right into my heart

382
00:48:56,776 --> 00:49:02,233
# Said all those things
I thought I'd never hear

383
00:49:02,365 --> 00:49:06,612
# You held my hand
when we went out walking

384
00:49:06,744 --> 00:49:10,244
Then all of a sudden you woke up crying.

385
00:49:11,749 --> 00:49:15,747
Just busting a gut over something.
I don't know what it was.

386
00:49:15,879 --> 00:49:18,880
A nightmare or something.

387
00:49:21,301 --> 00:49:23,459
Woke your momma right up.

388
00:49:40,862 --> 00:49:44,397
She climbed over the seat
there in the back with you

389
00:49:44,532 --> 00:49:47,070
to try to get you settled down.

390
00:49:49,370 --> 00:49:53,154
But you just kept wailing.
Wouldn't shut up for hell nor high water.

391
00:49:54,459 --> 00:49:58,373
So I stopped the Plymouth
by the side of the road,

392
00:49:58,505 --> 00:50:00,996
middle of nowhere.

393
00:50:08,807 --> 00:50:11,843
Can't even remember
where it was exactly.

394
00:50:11,976 --> 00:50:14,135
Pitch-black.

395
00:50:31,996 --> 00:50:38,248
And I picked you up out of the back seat
there and carried you out into this field.

396
00:50:38,962 --> 00:50:41,963
Thought the cold air
might quiet you down.

397
00:50:42,882 --> 00:50:45,836
But you just kept howling.

398
00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:52,428
And all of a sudden
I saw something move out there.

399
00:50:53,768 --> 00:50:56,686
Something bigger
than both of us put together.

400
00:50:58,731 --> 00:51:02,812
And it started to move toward us,
kinda slow.

401
00:51:02,944 --> 00:51:08,698
And then it started to get joined up
by some other things just like it.

402
00:51:08,825 --> 00:51:11,316
Same shape and everything.

403
00:51:13,413 --> 00:51:18,869
But these things started
to kind of move in on us.

404
00:51:21,629 --> 00:51:26,541
I looked back at the car
to see if your mother was all right

405
00:51:27,886 --> 00:51:32,429
and just then these things started to moo.

406
00:51:35,935 --> 00:51:37,975
They all started mooing away.

407
00:51:38,104 --> 00:51:41,438
- The cows?

408
00:51:47,906 --> 00:51:54,193
Sure enough, there we were standing
in the middle of a goddamn herd of cattle.

409
00:51:55,121 --> 00:51:58,822
You never heard a baby
pipe down so fast.

410
00:52:14,516 --> 00:52:20,768
You just never made a peep after that
the whole rest of the trip.

411
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:29,643
You got any gin in there?

412
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,599
# Rosa

413
00:53:43,688 --> 00:53:47,057
# He told me about you

414
00:53:48,151 --> 00:53:52,896
# He said that you danced like the wind

415
00:53:53,031 --> 00:53:56,281
# Go, Rosa, go

416
00:53:58,828 --> 00:54:01,533
# Rosa

417
00:54:01,664 --> 00:54:06,207
# I came here to warn you

418
00:54:06,336 --> 00:54:11,128
# That hombre belongs to me

419
00:54:11,257 --> 00:54:14,211
# Go, Rosa, go

420
00:54:14,844 --> 00:54:17,300
# Rosa

421
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:21,807
# Stop looking that way at him

422
00:54:21,935 --> 00:54:26,727
# My patience is wearing thin

423
00:54:26,856 --> 00:54:30,142
# Now you better go

424
00:54:31,653 --> 00:54:34,856
# Go, Rosa, go

425
00:54:36,157 --> 00:54:39,407
# Go back to Mexico

426
00:54:40,537 --> 00:54:44,784
# You and I, we are strangers

427
00:54:44,916 --> 00:54:48,581
# But your life is in danger

428
00:54:51,005 --> 00:54:53,081
# Rosa

429
00:54:54,175 --> 00:54:58,173
# Your eyes are as black as sin

430
00:54:58,304 --> 00:55:02,172
# They're casting a spell on him

431
00:55:03,435 --> 00:55:05,972
# No, Rosa, no

432
00:55:07,063 --> 00:55:08,937
# Rosa

433
00:55:09,816 --> 00:55:14,394
# Here north of the border

434
00:55:14,529 --> 00:55:17,945
# When you take a man like that

435
00:55:19,033 --> 00:55:22,865
# There's no law and order

436
00:55:22,996 --> 00:55:25,534
# Rosa

437
00:55:25,665 --> 00:55:29,283
# Stop looking that way at him

438
00:55:30,336 --> 00:55:34,797
# My patience is wearing thin

439
00:55:34,924 --> 00:55:38,293
# Now you better go

440
00:55:39,846 --> 00:55:42,467
# Go, Rosa, go

441
00:55:44,350 --> 00:55:47,933
# Go back to Mexico

442
00:55:48,646 --> 00:55:52,596
# You and I, we are strangers

443
00:55:52,734 --> 00:55:56,732
# But your life is in danger

444
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:04,545
- Asshole.

445
00:57:24,242 --> 00:57:28,156
Oh, that cow got away?
Come on, boy.

446
00:58:10,997 --> 00:58:14,532
Decided to jump off the wagon, huh?

447
00:58:14,667 --> 00:58:18,083
Hm. Mm.

448
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:29,504
- What are you doing?
- Just a little practice.

449
00:58:32,310 --> 00:58:34,552
Gotta stay in practice these days.

450
00:58:34,687 --> 00:58:39,231
There's kids out there
ropin' cattle in six seconds dead.

451
00:58:39,359 --> 00:58:42,229
They got it down to a science.

452
00:58:42,362 --> 00:58:46,609
- I thought you were leaving.
- Yeah, I was gonna.

453
00:58:46,741 --> 00:58:50,027
But then I got
about ten miles down the road there

454
00:58:50,161 --> 00:58:55,156
and it suddenly occurred to me there
probably isn't any man comin' here at all.

455
00:58:55,291 --> 00:58:59,371
Probably isn't any guy
or any man or anybody.

456
00:59:01,297 --> 00:59:03,788
You just made all that up.

457
00:59:11,141 --> 00:59:14,058
- Why would I do that?
- Just to get even.

458
00:59:26,406 --> 00:59:28,445
So that's how it is.

459
00:59:28,575 --> 00:59:31,944
Gonna get real mean and sloppy,
just like old times.

460
00:59:33,288 --> 00:59:35,115
- Well...
- Like old times.

461
00:59:35,248 --> 00:59:38,913
I haven't drunk in quite a while, honey.
I've been real good.

462
00:59:39,043 --> 00:59:42,163
I figure I owe it to myself for once.

463
00:59:50,763 --> 00:59:54,014
Have you balled him yet?

464
00:59:56,394 --> 00:59:58,434
Hm?

465
01:00:00,315 --> 01:00:02,354
I'm just curious.

466
01:00:04,277 --> 01:00:08,026
You don't have to tell me.
I already know it.

467
01:00:14,913 --> 01:00:17,949
I hope this man comes over here.

468
01:00:18,082 --> 01:00:20,574
I really hope he does.

469
01:00:20,710 --> 01:00:23,996
I wanna see him walk through that door.

470
01:00:27,425 --> 01:00:31,672
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna nail his ass to the floor.

471
01:00:31,805 --> 01:00:34,011
Directly.

472
01:00:38,478 --> 01:00:40,554
I'm not stickin' around for this.

473
01:00:42,732 --> 01:00:47,394
- Wait. Come on, take it easy.

474
01:00:47,529 --> 01:00:51,111
Honey! I'll back off, OK? I'll be real nice.

475
01:00:51,241 --> 01:00:54,277
I'll be just like a little old pussycat, OK?

476
01:00:54,410 --> 01:00:58,740
You can introduce me to him
as your brother, OK?

477
01:01:00,542 --> 01:01:04,835
- OK? Maybe not your brother.
- Maybe not.

478
01:01:04,963 --> 01:01:07,632
Your cousin, OK?
I just wanna meet him.

479
01:01:07,757 --> 01:01:12,051
- No! Why do you wanna meet him?
- You don't understand these things.

480
01:01:12,178 --> 01:01:15,096
You can tell a lot about a person
by the company they keep.

481
01:01:15,223 --> 01:01:18,556
- No. I'm just gonna go in the office.
- Come on.

482
01:01:18,685 --> 01:01:22,184
- We'll try and forget the whole thing.
- Good. OK.

483
01:01:22,313 --> 01:01:24,271
Great.

484
01:01:29,821 --> 01:01:32,656
Uh-oh.

485
01:01:32,782 --> 01:01:34,276
Great.

486
01:01:34,409 --> 01:01:40,115
Why don't you run out there and throw
yourself into his arms or something?

487
01:01:40,248 --> 01:01:43,498
- What are you gonna do?
- Put my hooks on.

488
01:01:43,626 --> 01:01:46,497
I wanna look good,
give him the right impression.

489
01:01:46,629 --> 01:01:49,915
- I'm your cousin, after all.
- I swear to God, if you hurt him...

490
01:01:50,049 --> 01:01:53,584
- I'm not gonna hurt him.
- He's just an ordinary date.

491
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:59,972
- I'm gonna turn him into a fig.
- Just this once, Eddie, do me a favour.

492
01:02:00,101 --> 01:02:03,470
Just one time.
Just this once, Eddie.

493
01:02:03,605 --> 01:02:06,392
Anything you want, honey.
Anything you want.

494
01:02:21,915 --> 01:02:25,615
What are you doing? May?

495
01:02:26,711 --> 01:02:30,210
May, what are you doing? May?

496
01:02:32,258 --> 01:02:34,880
- May?
- It's not him.

497
01:02:37,180 --> 01:02:40,513
- It's not, uh?
- No, it's not.

498
01:02:41,184 --> 01:02:44,304
Oh, too bad. Who is it, then?

499
01:02:46,106 --> 01:02:48,810
Somebody else.

500
01:02:49,859 --> 01:02:54,605
It's a big, huge, extra-Iong
black Mercedes Benz.

501
01:02:55,448 --> 01:02:58,153
This is a motel, isn't it?

502
01:02:58,284 --> 01:03:00,822
Rich people have to sleep too.

503
01:03:02,455 --> 01:03:06,120
This ain't a black Mercedes Benz
type of motel, Eddie.

504
01:03:08,044 --> 01:03:11,413
Somebody's just standin' out there
in front of that car.

505
01:03:11,548 --> 01:03:14,121
Just standin' there lookin' at me.

506
01:03:16,052 --> 01:03:19,219
What are they doin'?

507
01:03:19,347 --> 01:03:23,048
I don't think it's a they, Eddie.
I think it's a she.

508
01:03:23,184 --> 01:03:25,391
May, get away from the door.

509
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:28,521
Not that you know anybody
with a black Mercedes Benz...

510
01:03:30,108 --> 01:03:31,104
Stay down.

511
01:03:31,234 --> 01:03:34,899
- Who the hell is that?
- How should I know? Stay there.

512
01:03:35,029 --> 01:03:37,734
It's OK.

513
01:03:43,788 --> 01:03:46,955
I don't know who she is.
Just stay there.

514
01:03:47,083 --> 01:03:49,870
That is the kind of car a countess drives.

515
01:03:51,337 --> 01:03:54,706
You don't know her?
That's the kind of car a countess drives.

516
01:03:54,841 --> 01:03:57,795
- Stay down!

517
01:03:59,512 --> 01:04:02,383
- You OK? Stay down.
- I'm down!

518
01:04:02,515 --> 01:04:04,722
- How crazy is she?
- Pretty crazy.

519
01:04:04,851 --> 01:04:07,805
- Just stay down.
- Have you balled her yet?

520
01:04:19,491 --> 01:04:23,323
She's blown the goddamn windshield
out of my truck!

521
01:04:23,453 --> 01:04:27,036
- She what?
- She's blown the windshield out.

522
01:04:27,832 --> 01:04:31,782
- You should have thought of this!
- Where are you going? Wait a second.

523
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:34,624
- Keep those lights off.
- Don't you tell me what to do!

524
01:04:34,756 --> 01:04:37,247
She's gonna come back.
We gotta get outta here.

525
01:04:37,383 --> 01:04:42,508
- We gotta get your stuff...
- Stop it! Don't you dare pick me up!

526
01:04:46,434 --> 01:04:51,226
- Put me down!
- I came here to get you.

527
01:04:51,356 --> 01:04:57,109
I came all this way to get you. Do you
think I'd do that for anybody else?

528
01:04:57,237 --> 01:05:00,487
- Put me down!
- Listen to me!

529
01:05:00,615 --> 01:05:05,277
The amazing thing is, neither one of you
look a bit familiar to me.

530
01:05:05,411 --> 01:05:07,700
Can't figure that one out.

531
01:05:07,831 --> 01:05:10,867
I don't recognise myself
in either one of you. Never have.

532
01:05:12,961 --> 01:05:16,211
Now get your stuff.
We're gettin' outta here.

533
01:05:16,339 --> 01:05:19,790
No, I'm not leavin',
but you're leavin' for sure!

534
01:05:20,885 --> 01:05:24,965
- You broke my bed.
- I am not leavin' without you, May.

535
01:05:25,098 --> 01:05:28,265
If you're stayin' here, I'm stayin' here.

536
01:05:28,393 --> 01:05:32,473
You'll never get rid of me. I'll track you
down, no matter where you go.

537
01:05:33,189 --> 01:05:35,680
I know exactly how your mind works.

538
01:05:35,817 --> 01:05:37,856
I've been right every time.

539
01:05:37,986 --> 01:05:42,446
- Every single time.
- You gotta give this up, Eddie.

540
01:05:42,574 --> 01:05:46,274
I don't know what's in your head
any more, I really don't.

541
01:05:46,411 --> 01:05:49,365
Now you desperately need me?

542
01:05:49,497 --> 01:05:52,035
Now you can't live without me?

543
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:56,377
Why should I believe you now?

544
01:05:57,464 --> 01:06:01,675
Cos it's true? Cos it was
supposed to be true every other time.

545
01:06:01,801 --> 01:06:05,336
Every other time before this,
and it's true again.

546
01:06:05,472 --> 01:06:07,844
You've been jerkin' me off for 15 years.

547
01:06:07,974 --> 01:06:11,675
For 15 years I've been a yo-yo to you.

548
01:06:11,811 --> 01:06:14,896
You know what?
I never been split either.

549
01:06:15,023 --> 01:06:21,026
I never thought one way or another about
it. I either loved you or I didn't love you.

550
01:06:21,154 --> 01:06:23,193
You know what, Eddie?

551
01:06:23,323 --> 01:06:26,277
Now I just plain don't love you.

552
01:06:27,285 --> 01:06:29,361
You understand?

553
01:06:29,496 --> 01:06:32,580
You hear me, Eddie?
You understand?

554
01:06:33,875 --> 01:06:39,379
I don't love you, I don't need you
and I don't want you.

555
01:06:39,506 --> 01:06:42,127
- You get it?
- Get in the bathroom.

556
01:06:42,509 --> 01:06:45,344
I'm not gettin' in the bathroom!

557
01:06:45,470 --> 01:06:47,759
I'm not gonna hide in my own house!

558
01:06:47,889 --> 01:06:52,432
I'm gonna go out
and I'm gonna tear her damn hair off!

559
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:55,051
- May...
- I'm gonna whack her ass. That's right.

560
01:06:55,188 --> 01:06:59,399
Come on in here with your damn gun.
Bring all your weapons.

561
01:07:06,783 --> 01:07:09,155
Stop!

562
01:07:09,285 --> 01:07:11,823
No!

563
01:07:12,330 --> 01:07:15,533
Oh, no. It's all right. It's all right.

564
01:07:15,667 --> 01:07:19,830
It's all right. We were just
havin' an argument. It's OK.

565
01:07:19,963 --> 01:07:23,545
It's OK. It's just a little argument, that's all.

566
01:07:23,675 --> 01:07:25,881
Oh, God.

567
01:07:26,010 --> 01:07:29,629
I heard you screamin' when I drove up
and then all the lights went out.

568
01:07:29,764 --> 01:07:33,548
- I thought someone was tryin' to...
- Oh.

569
01:07:33,685 --> 01:07:36,176
No, they weren't.

570
01:07:37,188 --> 01:07:41,020
I better turn my truck lights off.
The battery will run down.

571
01:07:41,151 --> 01:07:43,274
Yeah, you better.

572
01:07:45,572 --> 01:07:49,901
It sure looked like you was gettin'...
you know...

573
01:07:50,034 --> 01:07:52,074
No, I wasn't.

574
01:07:52,203 --> 01:07:54,410
- That's him?
- I'm gonna kill you.

575
01:08:00,086 --> 01:08:06,089
Oh, Martin, this is... this is my cousin.

576
01:08:06,217 --> 01:08:08,376
Ed... die.

577
01:08:09,888 --> 01:08:13,221
- I'm sorry.
- She's lyin'.

578
01:08:14,434 --> 01:08:17,767
- Oh?
- Oh, no. You wanna come on in?

579
01:08:17,896 --> 01:08:21,763
- Have a drink. I bet you need one.
- Yeah.

580
01:08:22,525 --> 01:08:27,816
I'm gonna have to get you a...
wash you a glass, OK?

581
01:08:27,947 --> 01:08:29,572
- Yeah.
- OK?

582
01:08:29,699 --> 01:08:31,739
OK.

583
01:08:34,454 --> 01:08:37,739
She keeps the glasses in the bathroom.
Isn't that weird?

584
01:08:41,211 --> 01:08:43,666
I was startin' to think
you weren't gonna come.

585
01:08:43,797 --> 01:08:49,039
I'm sorry. I had to water the football field
down at the high school.

586
01:08:49,177 --> 01:08:51,086
- Forgot all about it.
- You did?

587
01:08:51,221 --> 01:08:54,506
- Forgot all about what?
- I forgot about the waterin'.

588
01:08:54,641 --> 01:08:58,175
I was halfway here when I remembered.

589
01:08:58,311 --> 01:09:02,605
- There you go.
- I thought you forgot about her.

590
01:09:02,732 --> 01:09:04,855
Oh, no.

591
01:09:04,984 --> 01:09:08,353
How far was halfway?

592
01:09:11,074 --> 01:09:13,113
Excuse me?

593
01:09:13,243 --> 01:09:16,279
How far was it
when you were halfway here?

594
01:09:16,412 --> 01:09:19,413
I don't know.
I guess a couple of miles or so.

595
01:09:19,541 --> 01:09:23,669
A couple of miles?
A couple of lousy, stinkin' miles?

596
01:09:23,795 --> 01:09:26,915
You wanna know how many miles
I came? You wanna know?

597
01:09:27,048 --> 01:09:31,924
- Huh?
- Agh! I'm so sorry.

598
01:09:32,053 --> 01:09:36,181
It's OK. We've been drinkin' a little bit.

599
01:09:36,307 --> 01:09:38,134
She's in deep shit.

600
01:09:38,268 --> 01:09:40,723
I'm gonna kill you.

601
01:09:42,021 --> 01:09:44,477
What's the matter, May?

602
01:09:44,607 --> 01:09:47,608
What? Nothin'.

603
01:09:49,612 --> 01:09:52,566
How come you had all the lights off?

604
01:09:53,408 --> 01:09:56,741
Oh... Yeah, we were gonna go out.

605
01:09:56,870 --> 01:10:00,239
- But you...
- And we were gonna come back.

606
01:10:00,373 --> 01:10:02,864
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

607
01:10:03,001 --> 01:10:05,871
That's not what we were gonna do.

608
01:10:07,088 --> 01:10:10,920
That's not
what we were gonna do, Marty. No.

609
01:10:11,050 --> 01:10:15,511
We were actually
havin' a big argument about you.

610
01:10:17,807 --> 01:10:20,049
- About me?
- Uh-huh.

611
01:10:20,185 --> 01:10:23,518
We were in the middle
of a big argument about you.

612
01:10:23,646 --> 01:10:26,351
It got so heated up,
we had to turn the lights off.

613
01:10:28,860 --> 01:10:32,229
- He's just joking.
- What was it about?

614
01:10:32,363 --> 01:10:38,616
It was about whether or not
you're actually a man or not.

615
01:10:39,704 --> 01:10:43,654
Whether you're a man... or just a guy.

616
01:10:45,877 --> 01:10:50,171
See, she says that you're a man.
Did you know that?

617
01:10:50,298 --> 01:10:52,919
Did you know that's what she calls you?
A man.

618
01:10:53,051 --> 01:10:56,918
- I didn't know that.
- I didn't. Don't worry about it.

619
01:10:57,055 --> 01:10:59,131
It's OK. I don't mind it.

620
01:11:01,518 --> 01:11:03,724
Didn't we say
we were goin' to the movies?

621
01:11:03,853 --> 01:11:06,060
Yeah. That's what I thought.

622
01:11:06,940 --> 01:11:11,020
- We drink on up and we go, OK?

623
01:11:12,946 --> 01:11:14,985
I'll be back.

624
01:11:24,082 --> 01:11:27,367
She's not mad or anything, is she?

625
01:11:27,502 --> 01:11:29,625
I didn't mean to make her mad.

626
01:11:29,754 --> 01:11:31,913
Huh.

627
01:11:49,149 --> 01:11:52,352
What are you gonna go see, Marty?

628
01:11:52,485 --> 01:11:54,727
I can't decide.

629
01:11:57,240 --> 01:12:02,068
What do you mean? Supposed to have
all that worked out, aren't you?

630
01:12:02,203 --> 01:12:05,074
Yeah, but I'm not sure what she likes.

631
01:12:05,206 --> 01:12:08,789
What difference does that make?
You're takin' her out, right?

632
01:12:08,918 --> 01:12:10,745
Yeah.

633
01:12:10,879 --> 01:12:14,497
You pick the movie.
The guy is supposed to pick the movie.

634
01:12:14,632 --> 01:12:17,918
The guy always picks the movie.

635
01:12:18,052 --> 01:12:22,346
Yeah, but I don't wanna take her
to somethin' she doesn't wanna see.

636
01:12:22,474 --> 01:12:25,143
How do you know
what she wants to see?

637
01:12:25,268 --> 01:12:29,562
- I don't. That's the reason I can't decide.
- Uh-huh.

638
01:12:29,689 --> 01:12:33,140
What if I take her
to somethin' she's seen before?

639
01:12:33,276 --> 01:12:35,981
No, you missed the whole point, Marty.

640
01:12:36,112 --> 01:12:39,113
The reason
you're takin' her out to the movies

641
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:43,570
isn't to see somethin'
that she hasn't seen before.

642
01:12:43,703 --> 01:12:45,743
- No?
- No.

643
01:12:45,872 --> 01:12:48,493
The reason
you're takin' her out to the movies

644
01:12:48,625 --> 01:12:51,460
is you just wanna be with her, right?

645
01:12:51,586 --> 01:12:55,880
You just wanna... be close to her, right?

646
01:12:59,052 --> 01:13:01,969
- Yeah, I guess.
- Yeah.

647
01:13:02,096 --> 01:13:04,173
You could take her just about anywhere.

648
01:13:05,725 --> 01:13:09,853
After a while you probably won't
even have to take her out at all.

649
01:13:09,979 --> 01:13:13,313
You can hang around here,
save yourself a lot of money.

650
01:13:13,441 --> 01:13:15,481
Yeah.

651
01:13:16,903 --> 01:13:19,987
- Oops.
- What'll we do here?

652
01:13:21,825 --> 01:13:27,945
Well, you could...
You could uh... tell each other stories.

653
01:13:28,081 --> 01:13:29,705
- Stories?
- Yeah.

654
01:13:29,833 --> 01:13:32,502
- I don't know any stories.
- Well, make 'em up.

655
01:13:32,627 --> 01:13:38,381
- That'd be lyin', wouldn't it?
- No. Only when you believe it's true.

656
01:13:38,508 --> 01:13:41,758
When you know it's a lie, it's not lyin'.

657
01:13:41,886 --> 01:13:46,098
- You want a hand up off the floor?
- No.

658
01:13:46,224 --> 01:13:48,929
I like it down here.
There's less tension.

659
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:52,144
You notice when you're standin' up
there's more tension?

660
01:13:52,272 --> 01:13:57,064
Yeah. A lot of times when I'm workin'
I'm down on my hands and knees.

661
01:13:57,193 --> 01:14:00,728
- What line of work do you follow?
- Yard work, mostly.

662
01:14:00,864 --> 01:14:06,106
Oh. You mean lawns and stuff?

663
01:14:07,203 --> 01:14:10,821
- Maintenance.
- You do lawns on your hands and knees?

664
01:14:10,957 --> 01:14:15,085
- Edgin'. Trimmin' around the edges.
- Oh, yeah?

665
01:14:15,211 --> 01:14:18,960
- Weedin' around the sprinkler heads.
- I get you.

666
01:14:19,090 --> 01:14:22,874
Yeah, I always noticed
how much more relaxed I get

667
01:14:23,011 --> 01:14:27,222
when I'm down on my hands and knees,
close to the ground.

668
01:14:27,348 --> 01:14:32,176
You can get down on your hands
and knees right now. I don't mind.

669
01:14:32,937 --> 01:14:36,353
- No, I'll stand, thanks.
- Suit yourself.

670
01:14:36,483 --> 01:14:41,477
You're just gonna get
more and more tense.

671
01:14:41,613 --> 01:14:43,652
Huh?

672
01:14:43,782 --> 01:14:49,072
- So you're May's cousin, huh?
- Yeah. See that right there?

673
01:14:49,204 --> 01:14:52,786
That's the result of tension, askin' me that.

674
01:14:52,916 --> 01:14:55,241
- What?
- Askin' me if I'm her cousin.

675
01:14:55,376 --> 01:14:58,662
- You know I'm not her cousin.
- How would I know that?

676
01:14:58,797 --> 01:15:01,751
- Do I look like her cousin?
- She said you were.

677
01:15:01,883 --> 01:15:06,628
- She's lyin'.
- Well, what are you, then?

678
01:15:08,973 --> 01:15:11,595
You're really gettin' tense.

679
01:15:11,726 --> 01:15:16,637
- Maybe I just better go on.
- No, wait. Martin, don't go.

680
01:15:16,773 --> 01:15:18,600
Don't go, Marty.

681
01:15:18,733 --> 01:15:22,897
It is blue and Ionely
out there in the black night.

682
01:15:23,029 --> 01:15:25,069
I'll tell you what.

683
01:15:25,198 --> 01:15:29,860
Let's go over to the bar and
have us a little drink. What do you say?

684
01:15:29,994 --> 01:15:33,695
- She gonna be OK?
- Yeah. She's always OK.

685
01:15:33,832 --> 01:15:38,244
She's just takin' her time just to torture ya.

686
01:15:38,378 --> 01:15:44,250
- How will she know where we went?
- She knows. She's got a sixth sense.

687
01:15:55,603 --> 01:15:58,889
Come on, Marty.
Come on. There we go.

688
01:15:59,023 --> 01:16:01,728
There we go. There we go.

689
01:16:35,810 --> 01:16:40,223
What exactly
is the matter with May anyway?

690
01:16:40,774 --> 01:16:44,143
- She's in a state of shock.
- Shock?

691
01:16:44,277 --> 01:16:47,646
- How come?
- Well...

692
01:16:47,781 --> 01:16:50,022
We haven't seen each other
in a long time.

693
01:16:50,575 --> 01:16:55,866
Me and her, we go back quite a way.
High school.

694
01:16:55,997 --> 01:16:58,037
Oh, really? Oh.

695
01:16:59,125 --> 01:17:03,205
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah. A lot of miles.

696
01:17:03,338 --> 01:17:06,458
So you're not really cousins, then?

697
01:17:06,591 --> 01:17:10,423
Well, not really, no.

698
01:17:13,473 --> 01:17:15,964
- You're her husband?
- No.

699
01:17:17,977 --> 01:17:20,017
No.

700
01:17:29,864 --> 01:17:31,904
She's my sister.

701
01:17:35,787 --> 01:17:38,278
- Your sister?
- Mm.

702
01:17:38,414 --> 01:17:42,661
Hm. So you knew each other
even before high school?

703
01:17:42,794 --> 01:17:46,293
No. I never even knew I had a sister
until it was too late.

704
01:17:46,422 --> 01:17:50,372
- How do you mean?
- By the time I found out, we'd already...

705
01:17:52,679 --> 01:17:56,629
you know... fooled around.

706
01:18:07,277 --> 01:18:09,565
- You fooled around?
- Yeah.

707
01:18:09,696 --> 01:18:12,068
Mm-hm.

708
01:18:14,951 --> 01:18:17,074
That's illegal, isn't it?

709
01:18:17,203 --> 01:18:20,904
- Only if you get caught.
- Hey. Who is this guy?

710
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:24,789
- Is that true? She's really your sister?
- Half. Only half.

711
01:18:24,919 --> 01:18:28,039
- Which half?
- The top half.

712
01:18:28,173 --> 01:18:30,212
In horses we call that the top side.

713
01:18:30,341 --> 01:18:35,846
And the mare is what?
The mare is distaff.

714
01:18:36,473 --> 01:18:39,046
Ain't that the bottom half? Distaff.

715
01:18:39,184 --> 01:18:41,935
It's funny I should remember that.

716
01:18:46,274 --> 01:18:49,477
You fooled around
in high school together?

717
01:18:49,611 --> 01:18:53,822
- Everybody fools around in high school.
- I never did.

718
01:18:53,948 --> 01:18:56,819
- Maybe you should have.
- Not with my sister, anyway.

719
01:18:56,951 --> 01:18:59,324
I wouldn't recommend that.

720
01:19:04,709 --> 01:19:07,461
How could that happen? I mean...

721
01:19:07,587 --> 01:19:09,829
Well, see...

722
01:19:13,301 --> 01:19:16,919
Our daddy fell in love twice.

723
01:19:19,557 --> 01:19:22,131
That's basically how it happened.

724
01:19:22,268 --> 01:19:27,014
Once with my mom
and once with her mom.

725
01:19:27,148 --> 01:19:31,478
It was the same love,
it just got split in two, that's all.

726
01:19:36,324 --> 01:19:39,693
How come you didn't know each other
until high school?

727
01:19:39,828 --> 01:19:42,663
He lived two separate lives.

728
01:19:43,373 --> 01:19:47,121
Two completely separate lives.

729
01:19:50,004 --> 01:19:54,797
He'd live with me and my mom and then
he'd go and live with her and her mom.

730
01:19:55,343 --> 01:20:00,385
Don't be too hard on me, boy.
It's happened to the best of us.

731
01:20:02,308 --> 01:20:06,009
- You never knew what was goin' on?
- No.

732
01:20:07,397 --> 01:20:10,600
Never knew.
Neither did my mother.

733
01:20:10,733 --> 01:20:13,141
- She knew.
- She never knew.

734
01:20:13,278 --> 01:20:16,729
She must have suspected
somethin' was going on.

735
01:20:16,865 --> 01:20:22,155
Well... if she did,
she never let on to me about it.

736
01:20:25,832 --> 01:20:28,952
Maybe she was afraid of findin' out.

737
01:20:32,172 --> 01:20:37,249
Or maybe she just... loved him.
I don't know.

738
01:20:38,553 --> 01:20:41,388
He'd disappear.

739
01:20:42,307 --> 01:20:45,224
Months at a time he'd disappear.

740
01:20:48,396 --> 01:20:50,934
She never once asked where he went.

741
01:20:52,692 --> 01:20:55,978
She was always glad to see him, though.

742
01:20:57,989 --> 01:21:02,698
I remember, me and her, we used to go
runnin' out of the house to meet him

743
01:21:02,827 --> 01:21:08,035
as soon as we saw him in the old
Studebaker, drivin' across the fields.

744
01:21:08,166 --> 01:21:10,205
It was a Willis.

745
01:21:11,628 --> 01:21:14,997
I never owned a goddamn Studebaker.

746
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:19,800
It was a Willis Knight.

747
01:21:28,478 --> 01:21:33,021
How'd you finally find out
that she was your sister?

748
01:21:34,192 --> 01:21:36,730
This went on for years, see.

749
01:21:38,154 --> 01:21:40,443
Honey.

750
01:21:40,573 --> 01:21:44,357
He kept disappearing
and then reappearing.

751
01:21:50,708 --> 01:21:55,205
And... then one day it stopped.

752
01:21:59,509 --> 01:22:02,178
He just stayed home for a while.

753
01:22:05,223 --> 01:22:09,173
He stayed in the house.
He never went outside.

754
01:22:11,479 --> 01:22:19,605
He just sat in his chair, starin'.
Then he started goin' on these walks.

755
01:22:22,699 --> 01:22:28,784
He'd go on these long walks and he'd
walk all day and he'd walk all night.

756
01:22:28,913 --> 01:22:30,953
Ellie!

757
01:22:32,625 --> 01:22:36,705
He'd just disappear in the dark.

758
01:22:47,432 --> 01:22:51,560
I remember watchin' him
from my bedroom window.

759
01:22:52,645 --> 01:22:57,188
He'd just disappear in the dark
with his overcoat on.

760
01:22:58,359 --> 01:23:00,435
Where was he going?

761
01:23:02,655 --> 01:23:04,695
Just walkin'.

762
01:23:07,452 --> 01:23:10,951
I was making a decision.

763
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:13,120
And one night...

764
01:23:15,168 --> 01:23:18,085
I asked him if I could go with him.

765
01:23:23,301 --> 01:23:25,341
And he took me.

766
01:23:27,889 --> 01:23:31,056
We walked straight out
across the fields together.

767
01:23:31,184 --> 01:23:36,558
I remember it was just ploughed
and our feet sank down in the powder.

768
01:23:38,024 --> 01:23:42,733
The dirt came up over the tops
of my shoes and weighed me down.

769
01:23:42,862 --> 01:23:46,777
I wanted to stop and empty my shoes out
but he wouldn't stop.

770
01:23:46,908 --> 01:23:50,526
He kept walkin' straight ahead.

771
01:23:50,662 --> 01:23:56,534
I was afraid of losin' him in the dark,
so I just kept up as best I could.

772
01:24:00,338 --> 01:24:04,170
And we were completely silent
the whole time.

773
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:07,301
We never said a word to each other.

774
01:24:07,428 --> 01:24:09,587
We could barely see a foot in front of us

775
01:24:09,722 --> 01:24:14,550
and these white owls kept swooping down
out of nowhere, hunting forjack rabbits,

776
01:24:14,686 --> 01:24:18,102
diving right past our heads
and disappearing.

777
01:24:18,231 --> 01:24:23,985
We just kept walkin' silent like that
for miles until we got to town.

778
01:24:27,657 --> 01:24:33,945
I remember seein' the old man in
the liquor store as he paid for the bottle.

779
01:24:46,342 --> 01:24:50,803
Then he came out with the bottle
wrapped in a brown paper sack.

780
01:24:50,930 --> 01:24:54,549
What are you doin'?
Attacking me or something?

781
01:24:54,684 --> 01:24:58,053
He opened the bottle up
and offered it to me.

782
01:24:58,188 --> 01:25:02,055
Before he even took a drink,
he offered it to me first.

783
01:25:02,192 --> 01:25:06,106
I took it and drank it
and handed it back to him.

784
01:25:06,237 --> 01:25:11,528
We just kept passing it back and forth
like that till we drank the whole thing dry.

785
01:25:12,994 --> 01:25:18,499
Finally we reached this little white house
with a red awning on the far side of town.

786
01:25:18,625 --> 01:25:21,994
# Listen to me, woman
Listen to me

787
01:25:22,128 --> 01:25:25,497
# I want you to understand

788
01:25:25,632 --> 01:25:30,092
We walked right up to the front porch
and he rang the bell.

789
01:25:53,409 --> 01:25:59,199
I remember gettin' real nervous because
I wasn't expecting to visit anybody.

790
01:25:59,332 --> 01:26:03,496
And then this woman comes to the door.

791
01:26:04,629 --> 01:26:07,915
This real pretty woman with red hair.

792
01:26:08,049 --> 01:26:12,960
And she throws herself into his arms
and he starts crying.

793
01:26:13,096 --> 01:26:17,010
He just breaks down
right there in front of me.

794
01:26:18,101 --> 01:26:20,971
She's kissing him all on the face.

795
01:26:21,104 --> 01:26:24,188
He's just cryin' like a little baby.

796
01:26:28,111 --> 01:26:30,150
And then...

797
01:26:34,909 --> 01:26:39,536
through the doorway behind them both,
I see this girl.

798
01:26:41,291 --> 01:26:43,330
She just appears.

799
01:26:46,087 --> 01:26:49,586
She's just standin' there starin' at me.

800
01:26:54,429 --> 01:26:56,801
And I'm starin' back at her.

801
01:27:02,729 --> 01:27:05,683
Can't take our eyes off each other.

802
01:27:09,402 --> 01:27:16,235
It was like we knew each other from
somewhere but we couldn't place where.

803
01:27:20,497 --> 01:27:24,245
But the second we saw each other,
that very second,

804
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:29,460
we knew we'd never stop bein' in love.

805
01:27:50,151 --> 01:27:55,442
Boy, you're incredible.
You're just unbelievable.

806
01:27:55,573 --> 01:27:58,859
Martin comes all the way over here,
doesn't know you from Adam.

807
01:27:58,993 --> 01:28:02,825
You start tellin' him a story like that.
Are you crazy?

808
01:28:04,749 --> 01:28:07,536
Are you?

809
01:28:08,211 --> 01:28:13,502
None of it's true, Martin.
He's had this weird, sick idea for years.

810
01:28:13,633 --> 01:28:18,876
It's totally made up. I don't know
where he got it from. He's a bit nuts.

811
01:28:20,682 --> 01:28:24,098
I don't know where he got it from,
but he's completely nuts.

812
01:28:24,227 --> 01:28:29,566
She's a little embarrassed about
the whole thing. You can't blame her.

813
01:28:29,691 --> 01:28:33,475
- Hand me a glass, please.
- You heard that, huh?

814
01:28:33,611 --> 01:28:36,019
Oh, yeah, I heard it.

815
01:28:36,156 --> 01:28:40,652
I heard it, every word of it,
and I followed it very carefully.

816
01:28:40,785 --> 01:28:46,124
He's told me the same story a thousand
times and it always changes. Always.

817
01:28:46,249 --> 01:28:51,492
- I never, ever repeat myself.
- You do nothin' but repeat yourself.

818
01:28:51,629 --> 01:28:55,959
That's all you do. You go around
in one big circle. Round and round.

819
01:28:56,092 --> 01:28:59,544
Did you think it was a story?
Did you think I made that whole thing up?

820
01:28:59,679 --> 01:29:03,262
At the time you were tellin' it
it seemed real.

821
01:29:03,391 --> 01:29:06,807
But now you're doubtin' it
because she says it's a lie?

822
01:29:06,936 --> 01:29:12,607
She suggests it's a lie and
all of a sudden you change your mind?

823
01:29:12,734 --> 01:29:16,150
- Let's go to the movies.
- Nobody is goin' to the movies.

824
01:29:16,279 --> 01:29:21,155
There's not a movie in a hundred miles
that can match the story I'm gonna tell.

825
01:29:21,284 --> 01:29:25,448
- I'm gonna finish this story, OK?
- Eddie...

826
01:29:25,580 --> 01:29:29,079
- You wanna hear the rest of the story?
- Sure.

827
01:29:29,209 --> 01:29:31,248
OK. Good.

828
01:29:34,172 --> 01:29:38,086
- I'm dyin' to hear it myself.
- Yeah.

829
01:29:38,218 --> 01:29:41,172
You think
this is gonna change something?

830
01:29:41,304 --> 01:29:43,344
No.

831
01:29:44,849 --> 01:29:49,476
- Then what's the point?
- It's absolutely pointless.

832
01:29:51,523 --> 01:29:53,349
Why put everybody through this?

833
01:29:53,483 --> 01:29:56,437
Martin don't wanna hear
this bullshit and neither do I.

834
01:29:56,569 --> 01:29:59,107
I know you don't wanna hear it.

835
01:30:02,033 --> 01:30:05,200
Don't try and pass it off on me, Eddie.

836
01:30:06,955 --> 01:30:09,576
You got it turned around.

837
01:30:10,917 --> 01:30:13,871
You got it all turned around.

838
01:30:14,003 --> 01:30:17,704
You don't even know
which end is up any more.

839
01:30:24,848 --> 01:30:27,884
I don't need either of you.

840
01:30:28,017 --> 01:30:30,508
I don't need any of it.

841
01:30:31,813 --> 01:30:34,897
Cos I know the whole rest of the story.

842
01:30:35,024 --> 01:30:37,515
I know exactly how it happened.

843
01:30:37,652 --> 01:30:40,855
Without adding any little tricks onto it,
Eddie.

844
01:30:40,989 --> 01:30:44,239
- What does she know?
- She's lyin'.

845
01:30:48,705 --> 01:30:51,825
Want me to finish it for you, Eddie? Huh?

846
01:30:52,876 --> 01:30:56,458
Want me to finish the story for ya, Eddie?

847
01:31:04,179 --> 01:31:07,713
See, my mother...

848
01:31:07,849 --> 01:31:08,845
May?

849
01:31:08,975 --> 01:31:13,684
My momma, the pretty red-haired lady.

850
01:31:16,524 --> 01:31:18,564
She was. She was...

851
01:31:21,446 --> 01:31:25,029
She was desperately in love
with the old man.

852
01:31:26,117 --> 01:31:29,985
Wasn't she, Eddie?
You could see it in her eyes.

853
01:31:30,121 --> 01:31:36,124
She was so obsessed with him
that she couldn't stand to be without him.

854
01:31:37,462 --> 01:31:39,668
Even for a second.

855
01:31:41,007 --> 01:31:44,791
So she kept hunting for him
from town to town

856
01:31:44,928 --> 01:31:51,677
and following clues he'd leave behind,
like a postcard, a motel matchbook.

857
01:31:53,645 --> 01:31:59,600
He didn't ever leave anything simple
behind like a telephone number

858
01:31:59,734 --> 01:32:01,774
or an address.

859
01:32:03,363 --> 01:32:07,526
Cos, you see,
my momma was his little secret.

860
01:32:08,535 --> 01:32:10,574
She hounded him.

861
01:32:11,663 --> 01:32:14,913
Hounded him for years and years.

862
01:32:20,672 --> 01:32:24,800
And he just kept tryin'
to keep her at a distance.

863
01:32:27,428 --> 01:32:31,426
Cos, see,
the closer these two separate lives,

864
01:32:33,351 --> 01:32:35,509
these two separate kids,

865
01:32:36,771 --> 01:32:40,187
these two separate women got together,

866
01:32:42,527 --> 01:32:44,816
the more nervous he got.

867
01:32:47,490 --> 01:32:50,361
And the more filled with terror

868
01:32:52,328 --> 01:32:56,741
that these two lives
would find out about each other

869
01:32:58,042 --> 01:33:02,289
and his little secret
would devour him whole,

870
01:33:02,422 --> 01:33:04,829
just take him by the throat.

871
01:33:10,054 --> 01:33:12,724
She finally caught up with him.

872
01:33:13,683 --> 01:33:15,925
She just dulled him down.

873
01:33:17,896 --> 01:33:22,143
I remember that day
when we got to that town

874
01:33:22,275 --> 01:33:26,984
and she kept sayin' - she was on fire,
she was crazy - she kept sayin'

875
01:33:27,113 --> 01:33:31,740
"This is it.
This is the place, May. This is the place."

876
01:33:32,827 --> 01:33:35,912
And her whole body was tremblin' like this

877
01:33:36,039 --> 01:33:40,333
as we were walkin' through the streets
lookin' for this house.

878
01:33:41,169 --> 01:33:45,498
I remember
she was holdin' my hand so tight,

879
01:33:45,632 --> 01:33:49,961
I thought she was gonna crush
all the bones in my fingers.

880
01:33:50,929 --> 01:33:53,846
She was so terrified.

881
01:33:53,973 --> 01:33:58,682
She was so terrified
she was gonna run into him by accident,

882
01:33:58,812 --> 01:34:01,682
cos she knew she was trespassin'.

883
01:34:03,233 --> 01:34:08,191
She knew she was crossin'
into the forbidden zone.

884
01:34:14,744 --> 01:34:17,864
But she couldn't help herself.

885
01:34:30,051 --> 01:34:34,096
So we walked all day
in that stupid hick town.

886
01:34:35,181 --> 01:34:37,221
All day.

887
01:34:37,350 --> 01:34:42,973
Goin' up and down every street
in all these neighbourhoods,

888
01:34:43,106 --> 01:34:46,190
lookin' in on every dumb family,

889
01:34:46,317 --> 01:34:50,018
peerin' through all these open windows.

890
01:34:50,155 --> 01:34:53,903
I remember it was exactly supper time

891
01:34:54,033 --> 01:34:57,533
cos everybody was sittin'
around the table havin' fried chicken.

892
01:34:57,662 --> 01:35:01,612
That's how close we were to the window.
We could see what they were eatin'.

893
01:35:01,749 --> 01:35:05,996
We could hear the voices but we couldn't
make out what they were sayin'.

894
01:35:06,129 --> 01:35:09,580
But Eddie and his momma were talkin'

895
01:35:09,716 --> 01:35:13,334
and the old man, he just sat there.

896
01:35:13,470 --> 01:35:16,636
He didn't say nothin', did he, Eddie?

897
01:35:17,891 --> 01:35:22,138
He just sat there in silence,
eatin' his fried chicken.

898
01:35:22,270 --> 01:35:25,271
She's off the wall.
You gotta do something about this.

899
01:35:32,781 --> 01:35:38,949
The funny thing was, almost as soon
as we found him, he disappeared.

900
01:35:42,582 --> 01:35:46,165
She weren't with him
but a couple of weeks.

901
01:35:46,294 --> 01:35:49,165
He just... vanished.

902
01:35:52,509 --> 01:35:55,878
Nobody ever saw him after that. Ever.

903
01:36:02,435 --> 01:36:06,433
And Momma,
she just turned herself inside out.

904
01:36:08,108 --> 01:36:14,609
I couldn't understand it. She grieved
like somebody had died or somethin'.

905
01:36:14,739 --> 01:36:18,191
I just couldn't understand that.

906
01:36:18,326 --> 01:36:21,410
Cos I was feelin'just the opposite.

907
01:36:25,625 --> 01:36:27,665
See, I...

908
01:36:31,005 --> 01:36:33,045
I was in love.

909
01:36:39,139 --> 01:36:44,180
I remember I'd come home from school
after bein' with Eddie

910
01:36:45,854 --> 01:36:49,057
and I was filled with this joy that...

911
01:36:56,406 --> 01:36:59,027
And there she'd be.

912
01:36:59,159 --> 01:37:04,117
She'd be standin' in the kitchen
just starin' at the sink.

913
01:37:05,373 --> 01:37:07,579
And her eyes looked like a funeral.

914
01:37:07,709 --> 01:37:12,999
I didn't know what to say to her.
I didn't even feel sorry for her.

915
01:37:13,131 --> 01:37:15,836
Cos all I could think of was him.

916
01:37:18,011 --> 01:37:20,584
And all he could think about was me.

917
01:37:20,722 --> 01:37:23,094
Isn't that right, Eddie?

918
01:37:25,727 --> 01:37:29,974
We couldn't take a breath
without thinkin' of each other.

919
01:37:30,106 --> 01:37:34,104
We couldn't eat,
couldn't sleep unless we were together.

920
01:37:35,069 --> 01:37:39,198
Eddie's mom didn't know
what was wrong with him.

921
01:37:40,492 --> 01:37:46,696
But my momma...
my momma knew exactly.

922
01:37:49,542 --> 01:37:51,998
Right down to her bones.

923
01:37:53,296 --> 01:37:58,456
She went to Eddie
and she begged him not to see me.

924
01:38:02,847 --> 01:38:06,892
She went to Eddie's mom and begged her.

925
01:38:14,526 --> 01:38:16,565
But Eddie's mother...

926
01:38:20,949 --> 01:38:24,199
Eddie's mother blew her brains out,
didn't she, Eddie?

927
01:38:25,495 --> 01:38:28,033
She blew her brains right out.

928
01:38:32,794 --> 01:38:36,957
Now, wait a second.
Just a goddamn second here.

929
01:38:37,090 --> 01:38:39,877
This story doesn't hold water.

930
01:38:40,969 --> 01:38:44,503
You ain't gonna let her off the hook
with that one, are you?

931
01:38:44,639 --> 01:38:48,933
That's the dumbest version
I ever heard in my whole life.

932
01:38:49,060 --> 01:38:54,267
She never blew her brains out.
Nobody ever told me that.

933
01:38:54,399 --> 01:38:57,483
Where in the hell did that come from?

934
01:38:59,404 --> 01:39:01,443
Well?

935
01:39:01,573 --> 01:39:03,612
Well, stand up.

936
01:39:04,826 --> 01:39:09,287
Get on your feet now, goddammit!
I wanna hear the male side of this thing!

937
01:39:09,414 --> 01:39:13,114
You're gonna represent me now.
You're gonna speak on my behalf.

938
01:39:13,251 --> 01:39:16,454
There's nobody to speak for me now.

939
01:39:16,588 --> 01:39:19,079
Get up.

940
01:39:19,215 --> 01:39:23,593
Well, tell her, then.
Tell her what really happened.

941
01:39:33,855 --> 01:39:35,894
It was your shotgun.

942
01:39:44,157 --> 01:39:49,531
Same one we used to duck-hunt with.
Browning.

943
01:39:51,915 --> 01:39:54,999
She'd never fired a gun in her whole life.

944
01:40:00,423 --> 01:40:02,463
That was her first time.

945
01:40:11,184 --> 01:40:13,473
Nobody ever told me that.

946
01:40:15,230 --> 01:40:17,637
I was left completely in the dark
on that one.

947
01:40:18,566 --> 01:40:22,149
- You were gone.
- Somebody could have found me.

948
01:40:22,278 --> 01:40:25,398
They could have hunted me down.
I wasn't impossible to find.

949
01:40:25,532 --> 01:40:30,359
- You were gone.
- I know I was gone, God damn you!

950
01:40:31,913 --> 01:40:33,953
I was gone!

951
01:40:35,125 --> 01:40:38,375
But I wasn't disconnected.

952
01:40:38,503 --> 01:40:41,539
There was nothing cut off in me.
Don't you forget that.

953
01:40:41,673 --> 01:40:46,382
Everything went on just the same
as before I left. Nothing changed.

954
01:40:53,726 --> 01:40:59,516
But your mother... Your mother
wouldn't give it up, would she?

955
01:40:59,649 --> 01:41:04,110
She drew me to her.
She went out of her way to draw me in.

956
01:41:04,237 --> 01:41:06,443
She was a force.

957
01:41:07,240 --> 01:41:10,823
I told her I'd never come across for her
from the very beginning,

958
01:41:10,952 --> 01:41:13,525
but she kept opening up to me.

959
01:41:13,663 --> 01:41:16,415
She kept...

960
01:41:23,006 --> 01:41:25,212
See, she... She...

961
01:41:26,217 --> 01:41:30,511
She... She kept
opening up her heart to me, see.

962
01:41:30,638 --> 01:41:35,846
You know, how could I turn her down
when she loved me like that?

963
01:41:35,977 --> 01:41:38,729
How could I turn away from her?

964
01:41:38,855 --> 01:41:41,809
We were completely whole.

965
01:41:44,194 --> 01:41:46,435
What are you doing?

966
01:41:47,906 --> 01:41:51,239
Speak to her.
Bring her round to our side.

967
01:41:51,367 --> 01:41:53,693
Make her see this thing in a clear light!

968
01:41:56,039 --> 01:41:58,115
Stay away from her, now.

969
01:41:58,583 --> 01:42:01,703
What the hell are you doing?
Keep away from her!

970
01:42:02,170 --> 01:42:04,578
You two can't come together.

971
01:42:05,048 --> 01:42:09,342
You gotta hold up my end of this deal.
I got nobody now.

972
01:42:09,469 --> 01:42:11,545
You can't betray me now.

973
01:42:14,432 --> 01:42:16,057
You're my son.

974
01:42:36,913 --> 01:42:39,830
I ain't staying. I ain't.

975
01:43:13,491 --> 01:43:15,531
May?

976
01:43:15,660 --> 01:43:18,151
- Hey, May!

977
01:43:23,251 --> 01:43:26,834
The whole place is burnin' down, May.

978
01:43:26,963 --> 01:43:29,999
Wait a minute, May. May?

979
01:43:31,759 --> 01:43:34,297
Do you need some help or anything?

980
01:43:43,062 --> 01:43:45,814
I got a truck. I can drive you
anywhere you wanna go.

981
01:44:01,289 --> 01:44:03,329
-Where are you goin'?

982
01:44:03,458 --> 01:44:05,497
May?

983
01:44:07,754 --> 01:44:10,589
You're not goin' with him, are you?

984
01:44:10,715 --> 01:44:12,755
He's gone.

985
01:44:14,511 --> 01:44:15,506
May?

986
01:44:30,777 --> 01:44:32,935
-May!
