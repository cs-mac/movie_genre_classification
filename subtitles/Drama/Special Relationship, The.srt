00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:17,140
Park Min Ho Kidnapping Case
Part 1 

3
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,250
Min Ho sent something. 

4
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,900
That punk didn't even show up today. 

5
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,310
He was here until 2 AM last night investigating. 

6
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,610
What investigation? 

7
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,210
I don't know. 

8
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:02,890
F! That's what it was written as. 

9
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,700
Director Yeo! 

10
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:04,980
Find the real murderer of the Majang Room Salon case. 

11
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:13,580
Send the result to tonight's 9 o'clock news. 

12
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:23,100
If we run...
or fail to find out... 

13
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,560
I will die. 

14
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,520
Okay. 

15
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:09,190
There was a murder last night around 1 AM in Majang. 

16
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:11,920
A male and female were shot. 

17
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,950
The video recorded on Min Ho's phone was filmed at 4:25 AM. 

18
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:19,400
Min Ho left work at 2.
He didn't get home. 

19
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,960
He got kidnapped somewhere on the way. 

20
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,420
The handcuffs he's wearing are the ones policemen use. 

21
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:30,510
Specialized handcuffs.
Only for police. 

22
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:34,880
But, Min Ho's handcuffs are back at the office. 

23
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,350
Is the kidnapper a cop? 

24
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,340
He knows us well. 

25
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,150
And he picked Min Ho among us. 

26
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,000
He wasn't "picked." 

27
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:50,750
If it wasn't for that F nonsense,
he would've left early. 

28
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,240
And this wouldn't have happened. 

29
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:01,740
Director Yeo. 

30
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:03,750
Stop the car. 

31
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:21,570
We can be easily played in a situation like this. 

32
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:26,370
If we give into this bastard,
then the law becomes a joke. 

33
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,120
Senior. 

34
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:33,030
Director Yeo. 

35
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,120
Let's focus on one thing. 

36
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,270
This time... 

37
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:42,710
We're only focusing on Min Ho. 

38
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,690
We really need teamwork now. 

39
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,060
At least for Min Ho. 

40
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,020
What are you doing here? 

41
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,340
What kind of case is it? 

42
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:27,820
You guys don't need to be here.
This case is already closed. 

43
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,400
The suspect is open. 

44
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,490
Total of 6 bullets. 

45
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,810
Usually 2 are empty ones. 

46
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:11,900
But if the suspect put in 6 real bullets... 

47
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:16,080
This wasn't an accident.
He intended to kill. 

48
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:25,010
One right next to his feet.
Shot almost vertically. 

49
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:26,910
The first one was a missed shot. 

50
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,980
He was either nervous or excited. 

51
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,770
5 random shots. 

52
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,600
The suspect must be an amateur. 

53
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,740
He must've shot randomly? 

54
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:42,410
Both victims were fatally wounded. 

55
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:43,450
One was shot in the heart. 

56
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:46,780
The other was shot right next to the neck passing the artery. 

57
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,660
That explains all this blood. 

58
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,360
What's this?
Can you take a look at this? 

59
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,110
This isn't a blood splash or a blood spill. 

60
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,840
Traces of blood wiping? 

61
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,810
Check the blood and the black stain beside it. 

62
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,080
Director Yeo.
Let's talk for a minute. 

63
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:35,210
Weren't those gunshots? 

64
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:37,960
Gunshots? I didn't hear anything. 

65
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,200
Follow him. 

66
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,060
Yes. 

67
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,470
Who is this? 

68
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:50,680
Suspect Ji Jin Hyun.
He was filmed during our internal investigation. 

69
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,400
Ji Jin Hyuk had an internal investigation? 

70
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,350
Not Ji Jin Hyuk,
Lee Byung Man. 

71
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,950
The room salon gate,
Lee Byung Man? 

72
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:03,690
Ji Jin Hyuk leaked prostitute information and accepted bribery. 

73
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:05,940
He had an affair with the female victim. 

74
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,450
He must've shot them when he saw those two together. 

75
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,940
This is going to be tough. 

76
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,840
What other location did we miss? 

77
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,340
Ji Jin Hyuk's house. 

78
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,780
I'll take responsibility for this one! 

79
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,880
What happened? 

80
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,970
We got a report from a county sheriff. 

81
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:33,510
The keys were still inside. 

82
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:37,330
And the car owner was a police so we preserved the scene as is. 

83
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:41,230
There isn't much traffic in this area. 

84
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,470
And there's no cameras. 

85
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,690
Kidnapped within 5 kilometers? 

86
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,040
Someone stalked him. 

87
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,570
You bastard. 

88
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:56,660
He's definitely not an amateur. 

89
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,780
There's no evidence that he was forced out. 

90
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,050
That means he walked out on his own. 

91
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:10,140
Why? 

92
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:20,840
Fake accident... 

93
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,910
The headlights are broken. 

94
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,870
It must've been a lower car. 

95
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,870
Where could he have gone? 

96
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:47,240
Car type, year, color.
You would know, right? 

97
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,890
You guys are pros.
Especially in hit and runs. 

98
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:54,610
It's my day off.
Let me rest. 

99
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:57,250
Call me as soon as you find out. 

100
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:00,880
You should at least have a drink with me! 

101
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,680
Only calls when he needs me...
What's going on? 

102
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:29,210
The arrest and search happened at the same time. 

103
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,860
Here's an escape.
Too high to jump off though. 

104
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,450
Plus, he was barefoot. 

105
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:47,280
Why is there nothing else? 

106
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,320
Director! 

107
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:00,280
Something is strange. 

108
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:08,040
The investigation states that the suspect shot through the window. 

109
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,100
But the neighbors say differently. 

110
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:15,140
They heard 2 gunshots and then they heard the window shatter. 

111
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:29,730
The black stain found on the cloth was a mixture of... 

112
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:33,270
Wax, oil, dye, etc... 

113
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,600
It's shoe polish. 

114
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,830
Shoe polish? 

115
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:37,080
Yes. 

116
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,630
He must've wiped the blood stain from his shoes onto the cloth. 

117
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,000
So it was dress shoes? 

118
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:52,970
He casually wiped the blood.
Horribly aimed shots... 

119
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,790
Something seems unnatural. 

120
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:59,160
Okay. 

121
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,210
Ji Jin Hyuk was wearing tennis shoes. 

122
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,170
He's being framed. 

123
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,590
Arrest is not the point for this case... 

124
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,680
It's his tail on the line. 

125
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:21,210
Lizard 

126
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:28,180
Two hours between the kidnapping and filming process. 

127
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:33,430
There are a total of 6 empty buildings in this 2 hour distance. 

128
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:38,770
Three left, Min Ho... 

129
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:46,570
Leaving your work behind is the same thing as a hit and run! 

130
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,310
What? 

131
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:49,730
Black Sonata. 

132
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:52,050
There's probably hundreds of that car in Seoul. 

133
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:55,220
But not that many passing from 1 AM to 4 AM last night. 

134
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,330
Get the plate number and put it up for search. 

135
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,450
At least tell me what happened- 

136
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:02,040
Hello?
You always hang up on me! 


137
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,990
Are you trying to cut his tail? 

138
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:15,520
What kind of nonsense are you talking about? 

139
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:26,920
Find the real murderer of the Majang Room Salon case. 

140
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:33,590
Send the result to tonight's 9 o'clock news. 

141
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:37,270
If we run...
or fail to find out... 

142
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:39,110
I will die. 

143
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:41,940
Okay. 

144
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,390
What do we do now? 

145
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,690
We have to find him. 

146
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:48,620
How are we going to find him by 9 PM tonight? 

147
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,590
I mean, the real murderer. 

148
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,750
Real murderer? 

149
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,650
Ji Jin Hyuk is the real murderer! 

150
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,810
We can't release that to the press yet. 

151
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,030
Chief. 

152
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:03,670
Help us find Min Ho or stay out of it. 

153
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:08,340
From now on... 

154
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,590
I'm going to do whatever it takes. 

155
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:26,550
It's certain that Ji Jin Hyuk is being falsely accused. 

156
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:28,840
The crime happened at 1 AM in Majang. 

157
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,570
And Min Ho was kidnapped roughly an hour later. 

158
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:34,500
Why would that bastard move so quickly? 

159
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,890
It's not enough to just find the real murderer. 

160
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,370
Min Ho was put inside a trap. 

161
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:46,890
We need to find out who made this trap. 

162
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,650
Illegal phone. 

163
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,780
We need to investigate.
Please step out. 

164
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,780
Ah, yes. 

165
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,960
It's the perfect place to record. 

166
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,080
No people, no guards... 

167
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,330
This isn't his hometown nor is it a police district. 

168
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:25,670
But seeing that he came here means he knows this place well. 

169
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:29,270
He's a suspicious person.
He's not stupid. 

170
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,450
He doesn't go to places he doesn't know. 

171
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,700
I found it! 

172
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,350
Where?! 

173
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,010
Are you asking me to analyze this picture? 

174
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:52,500
I need accurate information as soon as possible. 

175
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,170
Investigating an internal affair? 

176
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:06,700
The result isn't that great for a crime that was prepped for a year. 

177
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,840
1 year? 

178
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,580
The internal investigators have been working on this for a year. 

179
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:22,170
The VIP of that room salon always got away with it... 

180
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:24,430
So they prepared this for a year. 

181
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:29,240
In the end, that VIP's tail got chopped off. 

182
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,090
Anyway! 

183
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:34,030
Ji Jin Hyuk is a dead man. 

184
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:39,220
Even if it wasn't him,
he's getting 4 terms... 

185
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:43,770
He fell into the trap and now he's supposed to die. Perfect scenario ending. 

186
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:18,860
This car? 

187
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,870
Yeah! 

188
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,840
Thank god. 

189
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,520
Are you crazy?
We don't know where he ran off to! 

190
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,200
They're moving together. 

191
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,710
Thank god we have fewer options to choose from now. 

192
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:08,680
But it must be hard dragging along a grown man. 

193
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,300
He might be dead. 

194
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,000
Do you feed a dead person water? 

195
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,800
This bastard must've stolen another car. 

196
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,870
Call me if someone files a missing car report. 

197
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:32,910
I told you it's my day off! 

198
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:36,030
Damn, I'm hungry.

199
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,450
I don't know what's going on but don't get involved. 

200
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:44,960
This is Pandora's box. 

201
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,130
He's on the 2nd floor. 

202
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:33,540
4th floor. 

203
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,590
I think he went to the roof. 

204
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:25,180
The criminal wore your type of shoe. 

205
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:28,030
Wait. Wait. 

206
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:37,910
Prosecutor? 

207
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:43,700
Pandora 

208
00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:00,230
011-6310-1630 

209
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:02,470
This is Lee Byung Man's number. 

210
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:06,800
Ji Jin Hyuk and Lee Byung Man have known each other. 

211
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:10,930
They even had a conversation yesterday using the fake phone. 

212
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:16,590
What could they have been doing together? 

213
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,890
What bring you here? 

214
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,700
Ryu Mi Ho? 

215
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:46,320
Our business got shut down because of her. 

216
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,970
Shut down? 

217
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:50,350
I found out it was temporary. 

218
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:54,580
Has it been weeks now?
She ran away all of a sudden. 

219
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,960
Pandora. 

220
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:09,530
She was going to reveal Lee Byung Man's dirty deeds. 

221
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:11,880
But she disappeared all of a sudden? 

222
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:16,100
It seems like Lee Byung Man made her do deliveries. 

223
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:21,290
She did well at first but she wanted money and ran away. 

224
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:23,290
Later, she called us. 

225
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,880
Because she was scared. 

226
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,360
Not the police but to a prosecutor? 

227
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:33,530
She knew that Lee Byung Man was affiliated with someone in the police. 

228
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:34,800
And that... 

229
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,920
Lee Byung Man killed somebody. 

230
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,040
Very neatly. 

231
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,910
There are a lot of new apartments. 

232
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,330
How do you like it here? 

233
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:58,890
There are a lot of markets and it's close to Seoul. 

234
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:03,840
The kidnapper needs a place to hide where no one can see. 

235
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,500
He needs to run away eventually so he must know this place well. 

236
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:11,220
A place from his childhood,
where there is no connection. 

237
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,240
Very good. 

238
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,390
What size are you looking for? 

239
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,730
Are you living by yourself? 

240
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:26,390
It doesn't matter if I live alone or not. 

241
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,920
Not an apartment... 

242
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:31,910
A market. 

243
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,490
Somewhere with no cameras. 

244
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,890
Who is it? 

245
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:03,630
I'm with the police. 

246
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:07,260
Excuse me but is this where Mi Ho lives? 

247
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,030
Did you find her? 

248
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:23,170
When you're a social worker,
you see lots of kids like Mi Ho. 

249
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:27,890
Kids who are smart but turn bad due to lack of family support. 

250
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:34,890
Isn't it crazy that they still underage girls like her? 

251
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,580
How long has it been since she left the house? 

252
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,880
I think it's been a week now. 

253
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,880
After the Detective took her. 

254
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,110
Detective? 

255
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:53,180
A Detective came to get Mi Ho? 

256
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,370
Yes. 

257
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:06,120
Yes? 

258
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,650
There was a witness for Lee Byung Man.

259
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:10,090
She's a young student. 

260
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:11,630
Ryu Mi Ho. 

261
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:15,570
10 days ago, Lee Byeong Man sent a picture to Ji Jin Hyuk to find her. 

262
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:19,520
Then a week later, Ji Jin Hyuk took her from her house. 

263
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,180
That's where it ends. 

264
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:25,750
Pandora was trying to open the box and that's when it started. 

265
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:28,040
If Ji Jin Hyuk got rid of the witness, Ryu Mi Ho... 

266
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,510
He's not the tail, he's the body. 

267
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:33,680
The next target after Lee Byung Man. 

268
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,910
If we know what's inside Pandora's Box... 

269
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:40,450
Then we can find out who purposefully closed it as well. 

270
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:52,210
Ma'am! Give me some cold water! 

271
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,130
We don't have cold water. 

272
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:03,220
I had cold ones but someone just bought them all. 

273
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,350
All? 

274
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,920
A young man? 

275
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,000
Yes. 

276
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:14,920
That's him! He was just here! 

277
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,660
Where did he go? 

278
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:22,310
He drove off asking where Incheon was. 

279
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:23,650
Incheon? 

280
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:42,720
What happened? 

281
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,620
We're still checking the cameras. 

282
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:56,020
It hasn't even been 30 minutes.
Why are you looking at 40-50 minutes ago? 

283
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:59,220
We checked twice but we couldn't find anything so we went back. 

284
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:01,900
That can't be... 

285
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:05,060
From that store to here is only 5 minutes, 10 minutes maximum. 

286
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:15,030
This bastard. 

287
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:20,710
What's on the opposite direction? 

288
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:22,490
It's the way back to Seoul. 

289
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:27,590
He's still here. 

290
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:28,990
Keep looking. 

291
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:29,800
Yes! 

292
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:06,680
How is it? 

293
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:09,950
This time it's a hotel. 

294
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:13,670
I thought of you. 

295
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:18,300
Can you ask room service to get me some medicine? 

296
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:22,640
You haven't lost it yet.
Making jokes in this situation. 

297
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,990
I'm serious. 

298
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,850
I have no intention of killing you. 

299
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:38,340
If your team moves quickly,
you should be able to go home tonight. 

300
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:44,020
Those guys can't do it without me. 

301
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,990
I don't know why you're doing this... 

302
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,960
But we can help you. 

303
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:57,220
The fact that I'm your target means that you trust our team. 

304
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:03,640
Look at this kid talking nonsense. 

305
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:08,000
Can't you see the mask on my face? 

306
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:10,680
This mask from society? 

307
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,010
Put your head down. 

308
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:20,200
Chameleon 

309
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:29,390
Hyung, the missing car report came in. 

310
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:33,710
Old black Grandeur.
Number: 02-318 

311
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:35,310
02-318. 

312
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,220
Did you hear me? 

313
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,900
Where is the Chief? 

314
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,530
I'm not sure. 

315
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:55,440
Is he in a meeting? 

316
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,930
I'm not sure. 

317
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:21,070
Wait! I'm not here for you!
I'm here for Mi ho! 

318
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:27,810
It's all my fault. 

319
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:31,640
I introduced her to that place. 

320
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:35,030
You were the last person she sent a text message to. 

321
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:36,740
What did she say? 

322
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,690
This. 

323
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:48,570
The annoying one? 

324
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:51,990
Who is she telling you to call? 

325
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:54,390
There's someone who used to always scold us. 

326
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:57,970
Always told us to graduate,
not to blame our parents. 

327
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:02,600
He bought us food and told us to call him when we're in trouble. 

328
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:08,920
Mi Ho said that she found a way to live after stealing that money. 

329
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,950
But, she was still scared. 

330
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:18,390
I didn't call him because I didn't want him to worry. 

331
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:21,370
Mi Ho knew something was coming. 

332
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:26,450
Was this person someone who could've helped? 

333
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:27,710
Probably... 

334
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,830
He's a Detective. 

335
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,950
Detective? 

336
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:34,970
Yes. 

337
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,000
What's his name? 

338
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,630
Here. 

339
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,750
Isn't that it?
Black 3218? 

340
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,370
Don't point. 

341
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,860
He could be looking somewhere else. 

342
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,960
He's trying to fool me. 

343
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,860
Min Ho? 

344
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:00,490
Park Min Ho? 

345
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:17,350
What room is that black car staying in? 

346
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:18,690
Grandeur? 

347
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,700
It's Room 302. 

348
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,790
What's this? 

349
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:51,710
What the hell do you think you're doing? 

350
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:54,430
The suspect has a gun... 

351
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:58,980
Since when did we start shooting?
When?! 

352
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,770
Let's talk this over, okay? 

353
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,970
What station are you guys from? 

354
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:08,230
Internal Investigations. 

355
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:12,160
He left this place clean... 

356
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:20,530
He didn't clean, he just didn't come in... 

357
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:25,120
This means he knew we were after him, you fools... 

358
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:41,120
Well, kids who are fools become policemen. 

359
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:02,650
Don't blame me. 

360
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,680
He wants us to still chase after him. 

361
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:06,440
He still has a reason to not kill Min Ho. For sure. 

362
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:09,740
We have to get some time. 

363
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:11,930
Ji Jin Hyuk is not the murderer. 

364
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:16,120
He is affiliated with this case... 

365
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:18,680
...but he is not the killer. 

366
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:24,730
This is all they came up with for a year. 

367
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:30,680
It's worse than your work in half a day. Stupid people. 

368
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:36,300
Did you meet the prosecutors? 

369
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:40,450
They were on a race with Lee Byung Man's case. 

370
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:45,490
Dead or alive, we started this mess... 

371
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:47,690
...so we have to clean it up. 

372
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:51,720
Didn't you say to help or step aside? 

373
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:55,820
I'll back off but help me out. 

374
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,660
Find him before the prosecutors. 

375
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:03,450
More investigation is needed until I can find him. 

376
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:07,300
We need to get the press release as soon as possible. 

377
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:10,720
Fine. What are we doing with the criminal? 

378
00:42:11,350 --> 00:42:12,690
We need to make one up. 

379
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,910
Let's make one. 

380
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:33,270
The moon empties everything to become full once again. 

381
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:35,720
After the waning moon,
it becomes the end of the month. 

382
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:40,490
I'm also going to put everything on the line this time. 

383
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:49,940
Am I still in danger? 

384
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,600
It's over now. 

385
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:56,130
We got a confession that someone blamed you for everything. 

386
00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:59,240
There'll be a major investigation for all the corruptions. 

387
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,730
What about me? 

388
00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:03,930
You won't be on the list. 

389
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:05,840
Let's meet. 

390
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,240
I'll take responsibility. 

391
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:10,250
I don't trust anyone. 

392
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:13,080
You guys come here and... 

393
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:16,470
If something happens to me then it'll really get crazy. 

394
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:19,780
Come to the place where Min Ho was kidnapped. 

395
00:43:20,950 --> 00:43:24,390
Show up after the 9 o'clock news. 

396
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:26,230
We'll trade after the news. 

397
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,540
If you don't come... 

398
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:31,820
Then it won't get crazy... 

399
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:33,380
It'll be the end. 

400
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:14,310
Ma Suk Gi, 24 years of service.
International Investigation Team. 

401
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:17,300
Those two know each other. 

402
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:19,260
There must be a connection with the room salon and Mi Ho. 

403
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:23,070
He was the one filming on the night of the crime. 

404
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:26,360
And he was also the one with the gun at the motel. 

405
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,280
Weren't those gunshots? 

406
00:44:37,430 --> 00:44:40,040
Gunshots? I didn't hear anything. 

407
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:44,220
He was the one fooling around with the gun at the motel? 

408
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:47,180
Since when did we start shooting?
When!? 

409
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,830
Let's talk this over, okay? 

410
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:57,250
We still haven't located him yet. 

411
00:44:57,250 --> 00:44:58,440
Okay. 

412
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,100
Director Yeo. 

413
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:52,890
First news. 

414
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:59,050
The suspect for the crime that took place in a hostess bar yesterday is now arrested. 

415
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:07,160
The suspect is now under arrest for the shooting yesterday. 

416
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:12,720
Mr. Lee and Ms. Yang who grew a significant number of these businesses... 

417
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,680
...has been shot for unknown reasons. 

418
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:21,430
It is stated that he is currently being questioned for the purpose behind killing. 

419
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:25,860
The police cannot release any information during the investigation... 

420
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:30,040
...therefore they are trying their best. 

421
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:36,000
There is a high chance that the arrested suspect is a former police officer. 

422
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,270
This is Yoon Jung Hee from YCN News. 

423
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:06,280
Where is Park Min Ho? 

424
00:47:08,050 --> 00:47:13,020
I'm sorry but I don't even trust my own mom. 

425
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:14,770
So how can I trust you guys? 

426
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:19,550
I put him somewhere safe, so don't worry. 

427
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:21,550
Let me have some type of insurance. 

428
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:30,790
If something happens to me you know he's dead, right? 

429
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:34,450
Let's get in the car. 

430
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:36,630
We'll send someone over to get Park Min Ho. 

431
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,490
What is this? 

432
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:48,830
What's going on? 

433
00:47:48,830 --> 00:47:51,790
Stand still! 

434
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:57,110
What the hell? 

435
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:04,770
What's up with him? 

436
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:09,960
He's not talking... 

437
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:17,550
Director Yeo... 

438
00:49:18,690 --> 00:49:21,520
I think Min Ho's in danger. 

439
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:24,850
What's going to happen to him? 

440
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:36,070
What happened? 

441
00:51:58,350 --> 00:51:59,580
Dad... 

442
00:52:01,070 --> 00:52:03,600
Please come out of that hell now, Dad... 

443
00:52:05,610 --> 00:52:08,290
I'm not going to die there like that... 

444
00:52:09,770 --> 00:52:11,930
I'm never going to die like that... 

445
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,250
What? 

446
00:53:02,830 --> 00:53:08,080
Why is he... alone? 

447
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:14,200
2 hours ago, there was a shooting incident. 

448
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:17,510
They heard ammunitions... 

449
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:23,260
It's the same neighborhood as the cameras. 

450
00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:25,340
And... 

451
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:36,970
There were 2 reports of a gunshot in the Ya San area. 

452
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:27,390

453
00:54:27,390 --> 00:54:30,440
Find the real murderer of the Majang Room Salon case. 

454
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:35,280
If we run...
or fail to find out... 

455
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,580
I will die. 

456
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:37,990
Director Yeo. 

457
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:41,360
Let's focus on one thing. 

458
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:43,150
This time... 

459
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:46,760
Let's only focus on Min Ho. 

460
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:52,670
Since when did we start shooting?
When!? 

461
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:55,280
Let go of me and let's talk. 

462
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,400
Help us find Min Ho or stay out of it. 

463
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:02,070
From now on,
I'm going to do whatever it takes.
