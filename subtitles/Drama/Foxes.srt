1
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:19,539
Just a few minutes past
7:00 in the morning.

2
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:23,626
Hi, I'm Jeff Gonzer.
It's time to wake up.

3
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:25,754
- I know that you feel that it's completely...
- Wrong.

4
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,547
No, but you're ready
to wake up, aren't you?

5
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:28,840
- Yes, Jeffrey.
- That's good,

6
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,508
'cause it's going to be
a beautiful day today,

7
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:32,469
temperatures in the mid-70s in the city,

8
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:35,764
a little cooler near the beaches and
warmer in the valleys, as always...

9
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:38,641
Look it, you gotta wake up. No arguing.

10
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:41,936
It's time to stick your finger in your
third eye at least to wake yourself up.

11
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:44,105
You even have to get your dog awake.

12
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:48,392
It's just time to wake up.
Everybody, get up!

13
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:50,894
Hey. Shake your booty.

14
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,282
Jeanie, don't stay in there.

15
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:56,525
I'm not even in there yet.

16
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:25,971
Oh, Christ. We gotta wake up Annie.

17
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:31,560
Annie? Annie, wake up.

18
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:44,865
- Is Annie awake?
- Not yet.

19
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,628
I didn't even hear her come in.
I was totally vegged.

20
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,588
Yeah, she was sick all
over some guy's car.

21
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:51,955
Yeah? From what?

22
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:55,834
Quaaludes. Beer. Wine.
Some real heavy kind of pills.

23
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,463
Poor thing.

24
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:02,632
Teenage dopers. What a waste.

25
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:06,303
Don't do that.

26
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,941
The Three Stooges,
they always just sort of throw it.

27
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,609
She can't do that. She'll drown.

28
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,945
I'm only saying that's what
the Three Stooges always do.

29
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:16,197
I'm not saying she should do it, okay?

30
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:18,116
Yeah, well, you know,
she ditches one more time, that's it.

31
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,118
They're just gonna flunk her
and throw her out in the street.

32
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:21,318
Forget it.

33
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:24,706
- What's that mean?
- I mean, what the shit?

34
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:28,200
- Please.
- She doesn't care if she never wakes up.

35
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:43,141
- Hi.
- Hey.

36
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,883
What are you guys looking at?

37
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:48,438
Oh, my gosh.

38
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,106
- You're not gonna eat that, are you?
- I am really hungry.

39
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:52,817
It's really disgusting. Yeah.
And then tomorrow you're gonna complain.

40
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:55,102
You just take that and
rub it in your thighs.

41
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,479
You're such a dummy.

42
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:00,658
You're hilarious.

43
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:02,577
Get your hands off of there.
I'm gonna eat it.

44
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,361
But I want it.

45
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:09,709
You guys are really pissed at me.

46
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,076
How's your head?

47
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:14,505
A whole bunch of people just moved in.
I think I'm gonna barf.

48
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:16,883
- You don't look sick.
- Well, I am.

49
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,334
I just got a case of the munchies.

50
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:22,096
Anybody want to ditch sixth
period and go to the beach?

51
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:23,681
I got a hair appointment at Saks.

52
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:24,933
Thought you said I couldn't ditch.

53
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,601
That's just Phys. Ed.
You can ditch that.

54
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:27,727
What're you gonna do with your hair?

55
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,063
Mom's after me to have it chopped
so I can look like Dorothy Hammill.

56
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,147
What?

57
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,941
Like, she doesn't dig me
wearing her clothes, you know,

58
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,692
and having all the guys
think I'm mature, okay.

59
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:37,737
Like they'd be coming on to me
and not looking at her.

60
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,114
Get 'em to chop your
head instead, Deirdre.

61
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:41,199
That's pretty retarded,

62
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:44,234
considering who it was sick all
over that guy's car last night.

63
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:46,913
- Who cares?
- He cares. Don't you care?

64
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,039
I don't even know him.

65
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,375
Besides, it was this
really gross Trans Am

66
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:53,253
with some jerkoff dragon blowing
smoke all over the hood.

67
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,546
- Was he cute?
- Who?

68
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:57,757
The geek in the car, geekaloid.

69
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:01,052
The only geek I know
is Randy Teratunian.

70
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,929
- So?
- You're the one thinks he's hot.

71
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,014
- I do not.
- You said you wanted to go with him.

72
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:08,008
I never said I want to go with him.
I said I want to ball him.

73
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:10,802
Excuse me.

74
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:13,930
Did you tell your Dad that you were
staying over my house last night?

75
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,266
I gotta call him.

76
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:21,072
Guess what? For an elaborate change,
we are late again.

77
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:22,448
- I don't believe this.
- God.

78
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,158
- I do not believe this.
- Come on.

79
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:25,576
I'm always getting tardies.

80
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:27,787
- Anybody seen my keys?
- No, not again!

81
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,747
- Have you seen the keys?
- I don't know.

82
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,958
My keys!

83
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,668
Where'd you leave 'em?

84
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:36,786
Who knows? It's not my house.

85
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,250
Can I listen to Abbey Road?

86
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:47,557
Whenever I need to mellow out,
I always listen to my Mom's Abbey Road.

87
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,434
We're going to school, retardo.

88
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,227
When I'm 18, I'm gonna shine that place.

89
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:53,104
Well, you're 16 now.

90
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,096
Ain't that a bitch?

91
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,641
- Where are you going?
- To school.

92
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:44,145
Leave the keys.

93
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,940
- Why?
- Because you can't take the truck.

94
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,026
- We'll talk about it later.
- How come?

95
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,665
We'll talk when you
come home from school.

96
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,626
That's unfair.

97
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,336
Come right back.

98
00:07:58,436 --> 00:07:59,869
Can't we talk about it now?

99
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:03,039
No, please. I don't
want to start anything.

100
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,927
Well, I don't want to have
to worry all day that

101
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,762
you're just gonna pull
some big number later.

102
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,546
The school called.

103
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,266
Oh, God, I don't want to
talk about this now.

104
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,301
I know, Child Development.

105
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,020
You've been cutting.

106
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,524
It's just Child Development, Mom.
It's so stupid. You wouldn't believe it.

107
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,192
- Jeanie.
- Can I just have the keys?

108
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,977
- Please?
- Jeanie, I don't want to have a bad day.

109
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:28,356
Well, it's my truck, you know.
Dad gave it to me.

110
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,527
This is Sam.

111
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:34,946
My daughter, Jeanie.

112
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:37,073
Hello.

113
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,743
Hi.

114
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:43,580
Jesus, Deirdre, this is gross.

115
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:46,551
I don't know what I'm going
to do about this shit.

116
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:49,595
- We're walking.
- No!

117
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,389
God, you know what
I hate about this place?

118
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,673
When some place is too small,
you can never find anything.

119
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:58,229
I should go to New York and live
in a loft, become a painter.

120
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,690
I need space,
like 20 foot ceilings, you know?

121
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,734
Really, let's all go to New York
and open a boutique.

122
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,143
Yeah.

123
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:07,687
Dad!

124
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,195
Dad, please!

125
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,514
That guy is sick.

126
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,526
What are we gonna do?

127
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:47,268
Call the cops?

128
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:11,737
You're lifting the child by the leg.

129
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:14,282
You are not savages!

130
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:19,152
Take the child gently, ever so gently!

131
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:24,657
We show our babies love
and our babies grow up in love.

132
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,077
That's a rubber doll, Mrs. Steiner.

133
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,939
Excuse me.

134
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,819
You want a hit?

135
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:02,538
I'm a mother.

136
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:04,447
All right!

137
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:08,586
Creep.

138
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,755
- Don't you want to say hello?
- Hello, Scott.

139
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:14,374
- Wait a minute. Did you miss me?
- How's Susan?

140
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:16,960
Susan Halpern?

141
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:18,304
You know any other Susans?

142
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,932
Come on, I mean, so her folks invited us
to the beach for the weekend.

143
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,434
They were there the whole time.

144
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,969
And they never took
their eyes off of you.

145
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:30,181
Well, yeah. Sort of.

146
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,778
Hey, Jeanie, like your new hairdo.

147
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:36,104
It's not new, Mr. Symonds.

148
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:39,575
- Will you come to the office?
- Yeah, sure.

149
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:41,484
Wait a minute.

150
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,204
Don't I even get a kiss?

151
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:46,281
You think I want Susan
Halpern's bacteria?

152
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:11,232
- They were fighting.
- Something racial?

153
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:14,642
- No. A girl.
- Thank God.

154
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:30,501
- Do you know where Annie is?
- Nope.

155
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:33,671
- No idea?
- No.

156
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,840
Her dad's looking for her, you know.

157
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,957
No. I mean, I don't.

158
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:42,680
You see, I'd like to talk to her first,
find out what's going on in her head.

159
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:46,049
Then maybe I could smooth things
out with her dad. He's...

160
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:47,550
Crazy.

161
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,302
Angry.

162
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,939
He thinks she should go to a hospital.

163
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,733
- Where?
- A private hospital.

164
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,142
Someplace out in Sun Valley.

165
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,903
You mean, a mental hospital.

166
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,322
They work with lots of runaway girls.

167
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:02,023
She doesn't run away anymore.

168
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:03,868
She's been gone for a week.

169
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,786
But she's been at my house. Ask my mom.

170
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:09,415
I know, honey. But the guy's
her dad. He's worried.

171
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:12,626
You know why her sister ran off?
Really, Mr. Symonds, do you know?

172
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:15,379
He put handcuffs on her because
she got pregnant by some guy

173
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:17,715
and he acts like she's some sort
of fallen woman or something.

174
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,842
All she wanted to do was
go out and get an abortion.

175
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,918
No shit, Mr. Symonds.

176
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:27,590
Yeah, I know. The guy gets really angry.

177
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:31,678
Yeah.

178
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:38,986
Really, man.

179
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:42,448
I mean, how's Annie supposed to
become your well-adjusted teenager?

180
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,117
If she got right with her dad,
then she'd really be fucked.

181
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,484
For sure.

182
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,997
If she got so he thought that
she was like really A-Okay,

183
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:52,281
she'd have to become a policewoman.

184
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,169
She should have someplace
to go, you know.

185
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:56,619
Where?

186
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,956
Well, I don't know.

187
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,804
Sometimes I think it's
like 1:00 in the morning

188
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:08,891
and you just had a fight with your
mom and there's no place to go.

189
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:12,269
Someplace with like pillows around,
a little music,

190
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:13,938
some people to talk to.

191
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,471
That sort of thing, you know?

192
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:18,307
Someplace of our own, you know?

193
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,278
- Hey, Brad!
- Hey, hi.

194
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:22,655
- Where you been?
- I've been working.

195
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,031
Yeah? Aren't you going to school?

196
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:26,274
No, I got a job filling
up fire extinguishers.

197
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,577
- Have you seen Annie?
- Yeah.

198
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,496
- Where?
- On the bus.

199
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:31,747
- That bus?
- Yeah.

200
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:35,658
- Hey!
- Hey, bus! Dumb bus! Dumb fucker bus!

201
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,586
Hey, you sure you saw her?

202
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:40,047
Yeah. She wanted me to hang
with her, but I got to go to work.

203
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,841
Well, did she say where she was going?

204
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:42,967
Hollyweird.

205
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,218
You're lying. She's on probation.

206
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:47,638
Hollywood Boulevard is a bozo no-no.
That's what her parole officer said.

207
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,714
If you're lying,
you're really a low character.

208
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,633
Excuse me.

209
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,493
A major injury accident,

210
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:12,746
a collision on the Golden State Freeway
northbound on the Glendale Freeway

211
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:15,207
and San Diego Freeway
northbound north of Avalon.

212
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,574
Bruce Wayne, KFI in...

213
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:02,453
You're Dragon, aren't you?

214
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:07,959
Have you seen Annie?

215
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,090
Annie Mallick? You used to know her.

216
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:34,745
God, Jeanie, I don't know how
you can even talk to that guy.

217
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:36,413
I mean, like, he looks like,

218
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:38,248
he could hypnotize you like a
cobra or something, you know.

219
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:39,792
And the next thing,
you're out on the Boulevard

220
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,034
and you're dressed like
the Pointer Sisters.

221
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:51,261
I knew Annie wouldn't be here.
She's not that bananas.

222
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:53,296
I don't know.

223
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,317
- Hey, there's Mary!
- Who's she?

224
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,319
She's in my floral arrangement class.

225
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,405
Jeez, what a weirdo.

226
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:12,273
- Mary Weirdo.
- The Merry Weirdo.

227
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:19,530
Hey! Annie! Annie! There's Annie!

228
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:23,335
- Annie!
- Jeanie!

229
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,129
Jeanie! It's Jeanie!

230
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,338
Come on! Get in the car!

231
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,298
I'm walking my dog!

232
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:30,134
What, on Hollywood Boulevard?

233
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:33,137
I just found him! This is Loser's belt.

234
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,888
Just get in the car, okay?

235
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:36,974
Hey, baby, move it, will you?

236
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,308
You talking to me?

237
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:40,060
No, creep, you ain't my baby.

238
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,261
You don't talk to my woman like that.

239
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:44,273
Come on, just move it, will you, friend?

240
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,524
I ain't your friend.

241
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,226
You're busting my asshole, asshole.

242
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:50,853
Come on! Get in!

243
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,689
Jeanie!

244
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,499
You're on probation, you dumb shit.
You're supposed to stay out of Hollywood.

245
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,334
Loser was taking me home.

246
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:06,503
Well, just stay away from Loser.
He's in a street club.

247
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:09,423
I just wanted to get home and see
my mom before my dad gets there.

248
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:11,258
Yeah, he wants to put you in a hospital!

249
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:14,178
- A hospital?
- For severe maniacs.

250
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,679
He can't do that.

251
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:17,380
He can't?

252
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,718
I'm totally freaked.

253
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,316
You see your dad's car?

254
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:40,245
- Nope.
- And what about your mom's?

255
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:41,946
No, she doesn't have a car.

256
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,573
Okay.

257
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,411
Oh, man.

258
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,572
We were going to call, Mrs. Mallick.

259
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,773
I mean, my mom was gonna call.

260
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,994
Mom wants to know if

261
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,496
Annie could stay over our
house for a couple of days.

262
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,697
If that's okay with you.

263
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:17,092
Just so long as her dad doesn't come
along with a straitjacket or something.

264
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:22,338
If you wouldn't tell him where she is,
I'd really appreciate it.

265
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:26,342
I don't tell the man nothing.

266
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:34,318
I can't feel sorry for my mom.

267
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,727
Not while she takes shit from my dad.

268
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:39,990
Is this what you call barbeque flavor?

269
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,857
All right, let's check this out.

270
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:45,486
Here.

271
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:48,572
Gross!

272
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:53,369
You know, he's not really my dad.

273
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,173
Since when?

274
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,425
- It's true.
- No kidding?

275
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:01,553
Remember the flower children
that all the time used to do acid?

276
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:05,349
I was like 11.
I dropped acid and it all came out.

277
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:08,227
You know that guy, that cop?
He ain't my dad.

278
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:11,063
I saw my real dad. No shit.

279
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:14,024
- What'd he look like?
- Really cool.

280
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:19,404
A cross between Cary Grant
and the mighty Thor.

281
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:20,980
He was a motocross biker.

282
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:22,783
I don't see Cary Grant on a bike.

283
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,775
He was.

284
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:27,287
He was so beautiful.

285
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:28,946
You're crazy.

286
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:34,827
Hot breath.

287
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:41,500
Okay, now just cool it.
You know, just shine him.

288
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:07,160
Is that all you're eating?

289
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,320
Would you girls kindly
talk to each other?

290
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:13,792
What's wrong with her?

291
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:16,160
What's always wrong with her?

292
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,423
Please.

293
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:20,748
Forty-one cents, please.

294
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:24,460
- She's paying for it.
- All of this?

295
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:38,442
This okay?

296
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,444
That'll be fine. Thank you.

297
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,353
Thank you, Greg.

298
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,563
Greg.

299
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,899
Yeah. Greg.

300
00:23:58,186 --> 00:24:01,330
Hey. Stick the goodies
in the goodie bag.

301
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:08,712
I want to get out alive!

302
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:11,141
Just as long as it's not someplace
in the Valley, you know?

303
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:12,851
I've been thinking someplace
in the hills, you know?

304
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:16,480
With, like, avocado trees everywhere,
and a really great sound system.

305
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,899
- As long as the neighbors don't complain.
- Yeah.

306
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,609
Well, I don't know what I'd tell my mom.

307
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,819
Well, just tell her with all the
money she's getting for alimony...

308
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:25,396
She doesn't get alimony anymore
since she married Franklin.

309
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:27,324
- She gets child support.
- Yeah, I guess.

310
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,409
Well, you're the child, dummy.
It belongs to you.

311
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,495
Well, what about me?
My folks are still together.

312
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:33,038
Maybe they're about to break up.

313
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,947
God, Annie, don't say that!

314
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,417
Just tell her you need
a family unit, you know?

315
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:39,920
Because you haven't especially
got a family unit right now.

316
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,589
No, Franklin isn't
exactly a family unit.

317
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:45,467
Hey, I don't want you guys going through
this big number just 'cause of me.

318
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:46,593
What number?

319
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:48,762
Moving out. Finding a place of our own.

320
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:51,473
Well, you know, it's not just for you.
My mother would love it.

321
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:54,351
She's all the time talking about how
she's such a young woman and all.

322
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,770
God, my folks,
I don't know what they'd say.

323
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,855
They never think that
I should do anything.

324
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:01,900
Well, why don't you just tell them that
you're spending all your time at my house?

325
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,026
At least in the beginning.

326
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:06,363
Sometimes they make me feel
so incredibly juvenile. I hate it.

327
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,230
Hello, may I speak with Greg, please?

328
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:12,234
It's an emergency.
I'm calling from the hospital.

329
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:15,038
No, no, but pretty serious.

330
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:16,998
Not really. But pretty.

331
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:18,834
God, I look like shit!

332
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:22,995
I know you don't remember me,
but I was in your store today.

333
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:28,301
Deirdre Thompkins. I just bought
this little container of yogurt.

334
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:33,682
You know, I was thinking of some place,
like, with two windows on either side.

335
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:37,227
- That was Mexican lace.
- One in the morning where I could write.

336
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:39,146
And one in the afternoon
where I could paint.

337
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:40,846
I'm surprised you remember.

338
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:43,140
Jeanie, do you think we could do that?

339
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:45,569
I don't know. I gotta ask my dad, 'cause

340
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:48,738
if I tell my mother about the child support,
she's just gonna freak.

341
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:51,032
You see, I have well, that is,

342
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:54,995
I had these two tickets to the
Angel concert for tonight.

343
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:56,830
But I lost them and I thought,

344
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,823
maybe I might have dropped them
near your cashier stand.

345
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,117
You haven't.

346
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:04,203
Drats.

347
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:07,466
I mean, I looked through my purse
and everything. I mean, like...

348
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,958
Let me just look again, okay?

349
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:18,801
Oh, my God! Am I embarrassed!

350
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:22,481
I don't know how to tell you this,
but I feel so stupid.

351
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,441
I mean, I just found them in my purse.

352
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:27,319
I mean, I already told my date he's not
my boyfriend or anything, you know.

353
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,403
He's just my date.

354
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:29,779
But I already told him we couldn't go

355
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:32,231
and he's already gone down to
Newport Beach or something.

356
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,650
- Oh, God!
- What? What?

357
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:37,569
Oh, God, Greg. Well...

358
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:41,541
I don't know, I mean,
if you'd like, but,

359
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:43,659
you hardly know whether
you would like me.

360
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:49,382
No, no, no. I'm getting there in a
car with some of my dear friends.

361
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:51,250
But I could meet you in the lobby.

362
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,878
The Shrine Auditorium.

363
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:57,464
About 8:00?

364
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,175
Wonderful!

365
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,473
What're you gonna tell Bobby?
You broke your leg?

366
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:20,988
Hello Mrs. Koch? Hi, it's Deirdre.
Can I talk to Bobby, please?

367
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,701
He left already?

368
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:29,422
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
I went to Elaine's

369
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:33,375
and then I saw Princess
Lee Radziwell, right?

370
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:37,889
And I said, "Hey..."

371
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:41,216
Hey, Princess Lee, what're you trying
to do, make me sick or something.

372
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:43,802
- Look!
- Right on.

373
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:47,399
Hey, you fine thing!

374
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:50,309
Hey, you got any tickets you wanna sell?

375
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,612
Wanna buy some ludes?

376
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:54,364
Anything you want, baby.

377
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:56,440
Not from you, slime.

378
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:59,327
- Dykes!
- Dykes!

379
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:00,527
Dykes!

380
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:03,322
Baby!

381
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:06,575
Kissy, kissy!

382
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:17,628
- Yes, yes, yes!
- Come on, girls!

383
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:48,960
- Why don't you stop, please?
- Why?

384
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,620
To check your purse.
Pull it down, please.

385
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:56,333
Come on. Where you guys been?

386
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:58,803
The first group's already on. Let's go.

387
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:00,138
Good evening.

388
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:02,798
Look, we're missing Heavy Waters.
Skip says they're dynamite.

389
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:05,226
I see you got your tickets okay.

390
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:06,603
Yeah. Thanks.

391
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:08,021
You don't have to thank me.

392
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:10,148
I mean, my dad gets these
tickets for free, right?

393
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,608
- Hi, Scott. How's tricks?
- Hi.

394
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,193
Hey, who's Skip?

395
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:15,445
- A surfer.
- What's wrong with that?

396
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:18,689
Let's shoot the curl, man.

397
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:34,964
She okay?

398
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:37,634
Maybe you better go on in
and check out the seats.

399
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,636
I already did.
They're dynamite. Come on.

400
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,221
Dynamite...

401
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:43,515
You got an attitude, you know?

402
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:46,174
Why don't you just try
and be sweet, okay?

403
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,678
I'm not going in by myself.

404
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,481
Why not?

405
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:53,015
'Cause you're with me.

406
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,018
- I mean, you're...
- What?

407
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,479
You used to be my girl.

408
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:07,738
Hey, Jeanie! There's your main man!
Here's your guy!

409
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:14,494
- Hey, there's Bobby.
- Where?

410
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:21,376
Okay, Dee. Do your stuff.

411
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,682
- Hi.
- Hi, Deirdre. Am I late?

412
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,382
Who are you?

413
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:28,717
Who is he?

414
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,229
Bobby, Bobby.
I got to talk to you, okay?

415
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:34,389
Come on. Come here.
I've got to talk to you.

416
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:38,903
Are you sick or something?

417
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,896
Here. Why don't you sit down?

418
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,825
Have you ever known me to shit you?

419
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,285
Yeah, all the time.

420
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:47,704
Well, this is the one time that
I'm not going to, all right?

421
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:49,873
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. It's Annie.

422
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,958
She's really sick.

423
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:53,376
She doesn't look sick.

424
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:56,745
Well, that's 'cause she's not talking
to the blonde guy over there.

425
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:00,884
- I'm going in.
- No, no! Look, see...

426
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,886
We tried to distract her mind, right?

427
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:05,054
So we line her up with this guy

428
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:07,891
and she takes one look at him, right?

429
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:10,852
She totally freaks.
She thinks he looks like her dad.

430
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:13,813
- And she almost pulled...
- He doesn't look anything like her dad.

431
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:18,067
Well sure he does. I mean, he's got like
the whole cop thing going for him.

432
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:20,978
She almost pulled a whole self-destruct
thing right on the spot!

433
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:22,614
Bullshit!

434
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:27,160
And, well, you know that she's
always had this thing for you and...

435
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,286
Since when?

436
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:31,247
Since she was 12 years old!

437
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:32,916
Don't you remember?

438
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:36,336
She always thought that you
were like all four Beach Boys

439
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:39,621
rolled into one pair
of flippers, you know?

440
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:44,126
- You're a lying bitch.
- Yeah, and you're Annie's date.

441
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:45,919
Well, what about Deirdre?

442
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:49,339
She's being kind.

443
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:52,843
- Yeah?
- She agreed to sit with Greg.

444
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,805
For Annie.

445
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:08,108
You gotta keep it low, keep it low.

446
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,949
Two bucks.

447
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:18,962
Do you want a lude?

448
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:20,129
Hey, what's going on?

449
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:21,464
Hi.

450
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:24,342
- Where are you sitting?
- With Annie.

451
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:25,959
I'm her date.

452
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:30,839
Well, fuck you guys.

453
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:33,508
What's wrong with him?

454
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,761
I don't know.

455
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:41,693
Watch 'em move
Watch 'em shake it down

456
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:42,819
All right!

457
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:44,320
Strolling to the beat

458
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:47,355
To the beat of the song

459
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:52,778
They're looking good
Like foxes should

460
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:55,623
Dancing to the music

461
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:58,617
All night long!

462
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:04,048
No one can do it

463
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:08,627
Better than they can

464
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:24,017
Twentieth Century Foxes!

465
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:33,276
Hanging tough through thick and thin

466
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:36,789
They're stepping out
Stepping out of...

467
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:37,999
You get your tickets, all right?

468
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:40,501
Yeah, thanks.
My friends say thanks, too.

469
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:45,247
- All right. How's your mom?
- She's okay. I was hoping...

470
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:49,218
- Dad, can I ask you something?
- Yeah, of course.

471
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:51,628
- He's on the bass.
- Good. Okay.

472
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:54,557
Oh, God, we gotta go
to Seattle tomorrow.

473
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:56,559
Three nights in a football field.

474
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:57,884
Dad...

475
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:01,888
I'm sorry. Go on, ask.

476
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:04,516
Maybe after the concert.

477
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:08,019
Come on. We'll go in here.

478
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,398
Oh, Christ.

479
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:16,361
Here.

480
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,710
Are you that unhappy?

481
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:34,514
It's not that, Dad. It's just...

482
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:37,340
We want some place where we can
help each other, you know?

483
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:40,436
Look, why won't it wait until
I come back into town, eh?

484
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:42,387
I'm gonna be here all through Christmas.

485
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:44,482
We'll see a lot of each other.

486
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,567
Anyway, I want you to meet Sandra.

487
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:48,059
Did you meet Sandra?

488
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:51,479
- No.
- Good God, what a cook!

489
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:55,525
Her Japanese is superb. You'll like her.

490
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:59,362
Just a minute. Give us a minute. Please.

491
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,991
Getting any rest?

492
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:09,424
What you ought to do?

493
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:12,552
You ought to go out and get a
nice little place for you and Mom

494
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:14,762
in the Valley with some trees around it.

495
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:16,264
I'll pay for it.

496
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:19,174
Mom likes where she is.
I'm talking about me, Dad.

497
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,852
What a bummer.

498
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:23,563
Living in a place like that
with all those dead plants.

499
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:24,981
Look, it's not gonna take much.

500
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:27,224
It just means the child
support bit, that's all.

501
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:30,194
Look, I can't mess with that!

502
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:32,479
Those lawyers would roast me,
wouldn't they?

503
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:36,691
You need any money or
anything for clothes?

504
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:38,735
No, I'm okay.

505
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:44,491
Look. Stick with Mom.

506
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:48,828
Christ, it's bad enough
having an absentee dad.

507
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:52,207
- I don't mind.
- I do.

508
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:55,219
Look, I'll tell you what.

509
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:58,713
At Christmas,
let's go back up on to the ranch.

510
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,008
Come on.

511
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:07,222
One of these days I'm gonna
buy out Zak and the other guys.

512
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:10,934
You and me can own the ranch.

513
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:14,729
We'll get rid of all
those crazies up there.

514
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:17,366
Just you and I

515
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:20,068
and lots of your friends.
And well get some horses in.

516
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:23,780
Plenty of horses.
It'd be great, wouldn't it?

517
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:26,992
Yeah.

518
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:45,927
Waste the night away!

519
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,253
Can I stay with you tonight, Annie?

520
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:12,329
I'm staying at Jeanie's.

521
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:14,664
Well, can I stay with you?

522
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:17,917
What do you mean?

523
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:21,004
Can I sleep with you?

524
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:24,924
God, Brad. What if I meet someone slick?

525
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:27,135
You know, you really
are shitty sometimes.

526
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:29,387
'Cause I won't sleep with you?

527
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:32,307
We've known each other
practically forever.

528
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:43,276
- Can I stay with you?
- Me?

529
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,454
I told my dad I wasn't coming home.

530
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:49,407
You want to... Jesus, Brad.

531
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:51,326
It wouldn't be bad.

532
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:57,707
Jeanie?

533
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:27,330
- Duke! Duke! There's Duke!
- Hey, don't! Will you let go?

534
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,832
- Honk the horn! Honk the horn.
- Would you quit it?

535
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:32,742
- Hey, Annie, what about my party?
- Duke!

536
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,621
Hey! How you been?

537
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:41,000
- Oh, crap.
- Shit.

538
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:10,780
It's all over with Scott, huh?

539
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,541
Guess so.

540
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:15,044
You know, you've been together
with him for three years.

541
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:17,745
- It's too much.
- Yeah.

542
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:21,342
You know, when I first met him
I was so much in love with him

543
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,543
that every time I saw him, I'd cry.

544
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:28,423
He couldn't figure it out.
"Hi," he'd say, and I'd just blubber.

545
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:30,175
It was really weird.

546
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:35,763
I bought this necklace,
this bracelet for him in Laguna.

547
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:40,444
I never had the guts to give it to him.

548
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:43,062
Then finally, when we got together,

549
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:48,443
I never gave it to him, because it
reminded me so much of him that

550
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:52,614
I just didn't want to
let it go, you know?

551
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:59,537
He sure has changed
since he got the van.

552
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:02,207
Changed since he got the hair blower.

553
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:06,387
Guess you don't feel
much like my party, huh?

554
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:07,795
Yeah, why not?

555
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,933
Jeanie, there's a lot of other guys.

556
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:12,717
Yeah? Like who, for instance?

557
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,302
Lots.

558
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:17,388
- Lots of egos.
- No.

559
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,600
Out of control egos.

560
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:23,520
You know about guys.

561
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:25,772
What's that supposed to mean?

562
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,483
I mean you've slept with guys.

563
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:29,984
A lot.

564
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:34,373
I slept with a couple of guys in
ninth grade, 'cause it was new.

565
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:38,660
But I'm not some total
dingbat like Deirdre.

566
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:40,203
Okay.

567
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:44,082
- I'm no Suzy Slut, you know what I mean?
- Yeah.

568
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:49,629
- I slept with a guy once.
- What?

569
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:51,932
We didn't do anything or anything.
We just slept.

570
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:56,970
I mean, he held me so tight my
nose was pushed against his neck.

571
00:40:57,746 --> 00:40:59,357
I thought I was going to suffocate.

572
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,599
Who was this guy? The Boston Strangler?

573
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:04,070
You don't know him.
He's a much older guy.

574
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,489
You been sticking your nose in
somebody's neck, and I don't know him?

575
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:09,649
- God! We used to be friends.
- Come on!

576
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:20,702
Hey, sis.

577
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:22,495
What are you guys doing here?

578
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:25,707
Mother!

579
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:30,262
What are these guys doing here?

580
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:31,972
God, what a cry baby.

581
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:33,265
I'm gonna get furious at you.

582
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:35,184
- "I'm gonna get furious at you!"
- Sissie!

583
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:36,593
Put 'em up.

584
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,387
Okay, kids! In the kitchen, quick!

585
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:42,265
Scoot!

586
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,278
- Hi, Jeanie.
- Hi, Mrs. Axman.

587
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:47,571
What's the fuss?

588
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:50,116
Mom, you know I don't want
a bunch of kids at my party.

589
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:52,827
Okay, okay. Your friends
aren't kids anymore, huh?

590
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:56,029
Mom! I don't expect you to understand.

591
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:59,667
Come on. You know and I know that
that's malarkey, Miss Smart.

592
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:02,962
- Jeanie, turn that off, will you?
- Sure.

593
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:06,048
We'd just as well sit down and talk out
the ground rules of a few things

594
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:07,174
before your friends get here.

595
00:42:07,274 --> 00:42:09,009
- I don't want a lecture now.
- I didn't say lecture.

596
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:10,803
In front of Jeanie and everything?

597
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:13,764
Jeanie, you want a beer?
There's a keg in the kitchen.

598
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:15,256
No thanks.

599
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:17,759
Let's all sit down.

600
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:24,650
Mom, I'm trying to get my head
into having a good time, okay?

601
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,026
If you're gonna go and spoil it...

602
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:29,655
Come on and laugh a little,
for damn sake!

603
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:34,108
Dad and I got the keg of beer, which I still
can't believe, but damned if we didn't.

604
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:37,913
When the party gets started,
we're gonna go on to bed.

605
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:39,364
You'll have the house.

606
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:42,960
What if I told you some of
the people don't drink beer?

607
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,295
They drink other stuff.

608
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,829
What people? You mean
your high school friends?

609
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:51,000
Well, they drink Scotch and
tequila and stuff like that.

610
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:53,262
You drink Scotch, Madge?

611
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:57,465
No. But I could if I wanted.
I could drink it for breakfast.

612
00:42:58,242 --> 00:42:59,926
You drink Scotch, Jeanie?

613
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:02,220
No. I don't like Scotch.

614
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:07,475
They're bringing Scotch tonight?

615
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:11,562
Maybe. I don't tell them what to bring.
I'm not their mother.

616
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:17,777
Well, well, it's gonna be some party.

617
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:21,081
Maybe Dad and I should
go out of town tonight.

618
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:23,375
That way everybody wouldn't
have a mother around.

619
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:25,044
You're just going to make it impossible!

620
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:29,757
Everybody could get real drunk
on Scotch and have a free time.

621
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:32,218
A real sexual time, maybe.

622
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:34,303
- Did you call me?
- No!

623
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:35,930
Go to the kitchen, Sissie!

624
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:38,339
- I want to hear!
- Go!

625
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:43,521
It's so unreal. Why do they
always have to talk about sex?

626
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:47,775
It's not me, it's you. Your friends,
they're all talking about it.

627
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,852
They're having affairs in
junior high school. Oh, my God.

628
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:53,697
You don't think that we can
have any serious emotion, huh?

629
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:56,283
That any of us can experience
something really deep?

630
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:59,569
Jeanie, she's been in love since she was 12.
And I'll bet you don't even believe it!

631
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:06,460
I don't want you to think
I was born on another planet.

632
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,380
When Dad and I were going together,
we experimented.

633
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,457
Yes, we did. More than once.
I can't lie to you.

634
00:44:12,941 --> 00:44:15,261
Mom, you don't have
to get into this, okay?

635
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:18,880
But I always wished that we hadn't.
That we waited.

636
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:22,717
You don't understand. I have.

637
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:25,271
- I've waited.
- What do you mean?

638
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:26,605
I mean I'm a virgin.

639
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:28,222
What's wrong with that?

640
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:30,276
- I hate it.
- Thank God!

641
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:32,403
Sissie, bring your mother a beer!

642
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:33,978
Come on, Mom.

643
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:37,106
What're we gonna do with her?

644
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:41,620
We're not gonna have a party.

645
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,831
We sure as shooting are!

646
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:45,782
Madge says were not.

647
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:51,412
If you don't come out and say hi to
your friends, I'm sending them away.

648
00:44:52,898 --> 00:44:55,384
If I send them all away,

649
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:58,377
you are going to have to
call everyone and apologize.

650
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:03,090
And until you do...
You are making me furious, Madge!

651
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:07,104
Until you make an apology on the
phone to everyone of your friends

652
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:09,680
who comes by here tonight,
you are grounded!

653
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:12,475
You can bank on it!

654
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:23,245
Yeah. I think Angel's
real cute, you know?

655
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:27,573
That punk movement, they're a bunch of
retards with safety pins in their faces...

656
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:29,659
- But Angel's good.
- Yeah.

657
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:33,454
Gotta go home. The party's off!

658
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:34,872
Where's Madge?

659
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:38,000
- She's grounded.
- How come?

660
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:40,461
She's a virgin.

661
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:34,181
Hi.

662
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:38,227
How was the concert?

663
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:39,478
Fine.

664
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:43,190
I saw Dad.

665
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,029
How was he?

666
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:50,156
Fine.

667
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:56,871
What's wrong, Mom?

668
00:46:57,648 --> 00:47:01,667
I just read this frigging
page five times.

669
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:05,463
How come you're not asleep?

670
00:47:06,114 --> 00:47:10,092
Because I have a test tomorrow.
And I study for my tests.

671
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:19,685
Your dad thinks that if I get a degree that
I'll be smart enough to leave him alone.

672
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:24,283
Did you do your homework?

673
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:26,442
I don't have any. It's the weekend.

674
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,704
I got this crazy idea that
you'll go to college,

675
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:32,416
you'll read a lot of books.
You'll become this brainy person.

676
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:34,784
You'll know how to talk to
neurotics like your mother.

677
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:36,754
How's your friend?

678
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:39,747
- Sam?
- He seems nice.

679
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:41,248
He's with his wife.

680
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:45,836
- Ex-wife. He's divorced.
- That's cool.

681
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:48,807
He's taking me to lunch tomorrow.

682
00:47:48,907 --> 00:47:50,517
Did he take you to dinner last night?

683
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:51,717
What does that mean?

684
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:54,345
Nothing. Forget it.

685
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:58,901
I'm a 40-year-old woman and I'm
sitting here reading Plato again.

686
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:00,194
It's insane!

687
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:02,237
No, he didn't take me
to dinner last night.

688
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:04,156
And he didn't take me to dinner
tonight like he said he would

689
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:06,575
because his ex-wife called
and he wasn't free to go.

690
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:07,942
So he apologized.

691
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:09,244
What for?

692
00:48:09,344 --> 00:48:11,955
Sure, I should have had dinner with him
first and found what his intentions were.

693
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:13,457
If they were honorable or not.

694
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:16,960
I was too busy throwing
myself at some guy.

695
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:20,964
Like all the other divorced,
desperate UCLA undergraduates.

696
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:24,458
But I did it 'cause it felt good,
'cause I wanted to. Okay?

697
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:28,796
Okay.

698
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:33,092
Shit. I'm sorry.

699
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:19,513
I can't focus again.

700
00:49:20,248 --> 00:49:22,850
You gotta get your prescription checked.

701
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:26,062
I know. I keep meaning to.

702
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:48,209
Right there.

703
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:51,346
I would've loved Plato.

704
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:54,173
He and his friends,
none of them liked to wear shoes.

705
00:49:55,951 --> 00:50:00,054
"Thus far I have been speaking of
the fourth and last kind of madness

706
00:50:00,288 --> 00:50:03,525
"which is imputed to him who,
when he sees the beauty of the earth

707
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:07,353
"is transported with
the recollection..."

708
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:11,700
...the manager of the Shoe Stop shoe store
on Hacienda Boulevard in La Puente.

709
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,201
Good morning, Shoe Stop. May I help you?

710
00:50:13,301 --> 00:50:15,829
I have a hobby. I like to chew on shoes.

711
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:17,831
- It's something usually I do at home, but...
- You like to what?

712
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:19,499
Chew on shoes.

713
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:21,084
Today is my day off

714
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:24,046
and I wondered whether I
could come down to Shoe Stop

715
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:26,131
and just chew on some of the
shoes down there for a while.

716
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:28,717
Get out of here or I'll
personally kill you.

717
00:50:28,817 --> 00:50:30,761
I don't take them home.
I mean, I'm not gonna wear them.

718
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,387
Is it going to be noticeable?

719
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:35,265
If another customer comes in
and wants that shoe to wear,

720
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:37,017
is it gonna be noticeable
that somebody nibbled on it?

721
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:39,853
Are your shoes that quality shoes that
somebody's gonna care that much?

722
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:41,229
- Don't.
- Yes, they are.

723
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:42,898
I mean, we don't carry junk here.

724
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:46,568
You do have terrific prices down
there because it is self-service.

725
00:50:46,668 --> 00:50:47,611
Yes.

726
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:50,447
The shoes would sell
elsewhere for $20 or $16.90?

727
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:53,158
- Yeah, that's correct.
- I'm at a pay phone right around the corner.

728
00:50:53,258 --> 00:50:55,609
Why don't you let me come over...

729
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,120
All right. Why don't you come over now?

730
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,164
I have some shoes at the back.
We'll talk about it.

731
00:50:59,264 --> 00:51:02,000
I mean, if somebody's gonna eat shoes,
they might as well eat the best. Right?

732
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,450
That's right.

733
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:41,947
Jay? Are you leaving?

734
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:45,659
Just to New York. For a week.

735
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:51,290
I've been calling your place for weeks.

736
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:53,010
I couldn't call back.

737
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:55,220
Well, why? I mean, I was like dying.

738
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:56,888
Mom thinks I'm going with Terry.

739
00:51:56,988 --> 00:51:59,266
She likes him 'cause he smiles a lot.

740
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:01,050
It's obnoxious.

741
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:02,936
What's wrong with me?

742
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:04,762
You know.

743
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:09,975
The age thing.

744
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:13,071
- For a change.
- I'm 16.

745
00:52:13,171 --> 00:52:18,076
Doesn't matter. I mean,
my grandmother was having babies at 16.

746
00:52:18,176 --> 00:52:19,828
Well, Sheila had a baby at 16.

747
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:21,413
Yeah, my grandmother was married.

748
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:23,331
Well, she didn't want to marry the guy.

749
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:25,824
Okay, okay. Don't get mad.

750
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:28,118
I want to ask you a question.

751
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:30,955
Do you really love me?

752
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:34,051
- That's the question?
- No, I'm getting to that.

753
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:35,635
But I want to know that first.

754
00:52:35,735 --> 00:52:37,544
I'm in love with you.

755
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:39,797
You know what that means?

756
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,049
Yeah, it means you throw up a lot.

757
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:43,894
No, seriously.

758
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:48,190
Every time I listen to the radio,
every song I hear is about you.

759
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:50,015
I've been sick a lot.

760
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:52,393
What's the question?

761
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:58,784
Well, I know how we didn't
actually do anything that night

762
00:52:58,884 --> 00:53:01,661
because you have this tremendous
amount of respect for me.

763
00:53:01,761 --> 00:53:03,362
I appreciate it.

764
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:06,500
Like you say, you don't
want to rush into anything,

765
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:10,369
not when you feel so deeply about
somebody and everything, but...

766
00:53:12,939 --> 00:53:14,164
Yeah?

767
00:53:15,817 --> 00:53:18,419
What would have been so wrong with it?

768
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:20,421
What?

769
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:26,010
If we made love.
Would it have been so terrible?

770
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:29,054
Well, no.

771
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,393
What time does your plane leave?

772
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:39,148
They got planes going
all day to New York.

773
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:54,422
Hello?

774
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:57,416
Jeanie? Hi.

775
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,753
I've been a terrible friend to you.

776
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:03,181
I've been keeping a secret from you.

777
00:54:03,281 --> 00:54:06,342
It's just about the most
important secret in my life.

778
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:10,846
I feel terrible. I'm in love.

779
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:15,476
A guy named Jay. You don't know him.

780
00:54:15,835 --> 00:54:17,227
He's much older.

781
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:20,856
Yeah, guess what?

782
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:24,693
I'm in his bed now. Yeah.

783
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:29,448
Madge?

784
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:31,742
Did you cry?

785
00:54:36,564 --> 00:54:38,332
What the hell, maybe I will.

786
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:41,136
He says if I want why don't
I spend all my time here?

787
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:44,671
Except when he's out of town,
and then he says everybody can stay here.

788
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:49,009
Yeah, Annie, too. Annie's cool.

789
00:54:52,747 --> 00:54:56,600
Well, he wants to meet you, too.
But I'll talk to you later, okay?

790
00:54:57,252 --> 00:55:00,229
Okay. Yeah, okay. Bye.

791
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:11,323
- That was Madge.
- I heard.

792
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:17,704
Things like that can really
make you sad, you know?

793
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:22,376
Yeah. The day your best
friend gets de-virginized.

794
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:27,589
No, it's not that.

795
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:32,187
She's the type of girl that...

796
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:35,764
She goes to bed with a guy once
and that's it, she's gonna marry him.

797
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:42,354
Come on. A girl gets married at 16,
she'd have to be real ugly.

798
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:46,316
We'll probably never see her again.

799
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:55,701
You know, I'm not gonna
get married until I'm 26.

800
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:59,997
Maybe I'll have a baby and then
decide if I really need the guy.

801
00:56:00,648 --> 00:56:03,125
But not before I'm 26.

802
00:56:05,278 --> 00:56:07,713
What are you gonna do up until then?

803
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:13,969
Just what I'm doing now.
Have a good time.

804
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:16,430
Good time.

805
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:20,684
This is making me sick.

806
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:22,696
I hope Jay doesn't mind us
using all his logs.

807
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:24,480
Nah, he won't mind.

808
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:28,108
- Wait a minute.
- Shit.

809
00:56:29,677 --> 00:56:31,413
We gonna have a fire again?

810
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:34,124
- We're trying.
- Isn't it awful hot?

811
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:35,959
Didn't you like the
fire we had last night?

812
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:39,661
Yeah, it was like Camp Fire Girls.

813
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:41,965
A lot of the old songs.

814
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:44,291
When you got a home,
you gotta have a hearth.

815
00:56:45,026 --> 00:56:47,044
Okay. Here we go.

816
00:56:50,448 --> 00:56:51,933
God, look at this!

817
00:56:52,033 --> 00:56:54,384
Look what you did to my floor.

818
00:56:55,036 --> 00:56:56,521
It's Jay's floor.

819
00:56:56,621 --> 00:56:58,680
We better get a vacuum
and clean this shit up.

820
00:56:59,457 --> 00:57:00,557
Hi.

821
00:57:05,171 --> 00:57:07,866
- Yellow Zonkers. Fiddle Faddle.
- Caramel.

822
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:09,284
- Twinkies!
- LAY'S!

823
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:10,827
- Look at this!
- Wheat Thins?

824
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:11,953
I'm on a diet.

825
00:57:12,053 --> 00:57:13,747
- What's this?
- Malt liquor.

826
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:15,790
This is supposed to be a dinner,
not a football game.

827
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:19,085
- Go yourself next time!
- You're the only one with an ID.

828
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:21,463
- Where's the cream cheese?
- I ran out of money.

829
00:57:21,563 --> 00:57:25,592
No dip? Thirteen bucks and no dip?
I don't believe you, Deirdre.

830
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:27,218
God, what a gimp.

831
00:57:27,318 --> 00:57:28,636
No dip?

832
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:30,379
Fuck you all, okay?

833
00:57:36,077 --> 00:57:40,565
I'm the only one who has to go to the
store all the time and buy that stuff.

834
00:57:40,665 --> 00:57:43,443
And my mom doesn't even
know where I am for sure.

835
00:57:43,543 --> 00:57:46,488
She sounded really worried on the phone.

836
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:47,739
Come on, Dee.

837
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,991
I don't even know what we're doing here.

838
00:57:50,091 --> 00:57:52,869
This is a place of our own, you know?
A family sort of.

839
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:54,361
Wait right here.

840
00:57:55,513 --> 00:57:58,083
Maybe I should go
home for a little while.

841
00:57:58,183 --> 00:58:00,043
Look, Dee, forget your mom, you know?

842
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:03,078
When you go out in the world,
it gets scary sometimes.

843
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:04,871
Learn to laugh a little.

844
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:10,637
Yeah. Why don't we ever have a party?

845
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:12,212
A party without Jay?

846
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:16,216
Forget it.

847
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:27,519
I'm sorry. I'll be right back.

848
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:31,231
Hey! This is dumb.

849
00:58:35,303 --> 00:58:36,403
Jeanie?

850
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:41,575
How about a little something
for those glasses?

851
00:58:47,398 --> 00:58:49,249
- Shit!
- Annie!

852
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:52,169
Terry?

853
00:58:53,279 --> 00:58:56,673
Carter? Here you go. Greg?

854
00:58:57,659 --> 00:58:59,259
Thanks.

855
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:01,428
Greg?

856
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:09,603
Need anything from the kitchen?

857
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:11,521
Yeah, just you, Deirdre.

858
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:15,618
I think this occasion calls for a toast.

859
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:18,820
Great. Carter has this
tremendous speaking voice.

860
00:59:20,848 --> 00:59:22,917
Shit!

861
00:59:23,017 --> 00:59:24,461
- I'll get it.
- I got it!

862
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:25,837
I'll get it! I'll get it!

863
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:28,163
Are you gonna be gross at our party?

864
00:59:30,191 --> 00:59:33,293
I told you we shouldn't invite him.
I wanted a real date.

865
00:59:33,444 --> 00:59:35,889
- I'm a real date.
- You're a nerd.

866
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:38,090
You know, you piss me off sometimes.

867
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:41,936
Well, why don't you just grow up?
Get taller or something.

868
00:59:42,036 --> 00:59:43,771
Brad, you're tall enough to eat dinner.

869
00:59:43,871 --> 00:59:46,014
Now why don't you dry up?
Go get some coffee.

870
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:48,684
It's okay.

871
00:59:54,048 --> 00:59:55,524
I'm sorry.

872
00:59:57,552 --> 00:59:59,778
Hey! Rejection.

873
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:15,261
- Hey, hey, is this stoked?
- Yeah, really stoked.

874
01:00:15,361 --> 01:00:17,754
Why don't you sit over there, okay?

875
01:00:40,845 --> 01:00:43,029
- All right.
- Nice!

876
01:00:43,264 --> 01:00:44,948
Everyone, start.

877
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:50,328
I'll be back.

878
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:56,209
- Is Laurie here?
- No, Debbie, this is a private party.

879
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:58,221
Well, Laurie told me to meet her here.

880
01:00:58,321 --> 01:00:59,681
Look, Debby,
I'm really gonna get pissed.

881
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:02,183
I don't know how Laurie
knows about this party, okay?

882
01:01:02,283 --> 01:01:03,759
Well, excuse me!

883
01:01:04,118 --> 01:01:06,052
Can I at least come in and wait for her?

884
01:01:06,287 --> 01:01:07,981
- No.
- God!

885
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:09,181
Good night.

886
01:01:20,051 --> 01:01:22,694
This party is, like, wow!

887
01:01:23,888 --> 01:01:25,540
I looked over at the other table.

888
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,375
- Yeah?
- And it was her!

889
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:29,877
Joni Mitchell, man.

890
01:01:29,977 --> 01:01:32,880
I could not believe it
and she looked terrific.

891
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:37,677
Anyway I put my hand on Corky's hand
and I go, "Hey, that's Joni Mitchell."

892
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:41,171
And he goes, "Yeah," you know,
just like it was his mother or something.

893
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:47,010
Joni Mitchell. Wow! It was
like freaking out. I mean...

894
01:01:47,578 --> 01:01:51,097
I could not believe it.
Joni Mitchell. Wow, man.

895
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:54,360
Anybody hear the new
album by Weather Report?

896
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:57,947
I smiled at her. She smiled
back at me. No shit, man.

897
01:01:58,047 --> 01:02:01,701
I thought that was so hip.
I mean, Joni Mitchell smiled at me.

898
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:03,202
Okay, Annie, okay.

899
01:02:03,302 --> 01:02:06,446
- I mean, no shit.
- Okay. Calm down, all right?

900
01:02:08,474 --> 01:02:09,616
My turn.

901
01:02:10,101 --> 01:02:12,410
At least she wasn't some stuck-up twat.

902
01:02:14,856 --> 01:02:16,382
- Scarlett!
- Jason.

903
01:02:16,482 --> 01:02:18,593
Scarlett, it's Rhett. Let me in.

904
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:19,927
Very funny.

905
01:02:20,027 --> 01:02:21,971
On good looks alone,
I deserve more than that.

906
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:24,641
Look, why don't you take your good
looks back down the hill, all right?

907
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:28,093
- Jason! Jason!
- Hey, hey, Princess.

908
01:02:28,536 --> 01:02:29,646
You still go to Hollywood High?

909
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:32,607
No, Christ. I go to Pierce College now.
I'm a Psych major.

910
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:34,108
Come on in and have some champagne.

911
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:35,818
Look, this is a private party, okay?

912
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:37,695
What? You guys know Buddy, don't you?

913
01:02:37,795 --> 01:02:39,697
Hey Buddy, you want some champagne?

914
01:02:39,797 --> 01:02:41,407
- Come on in, Buddy.
- Banzai, all right.

915
01:02:41,507 --> 01:02:42,450
No, you don't. No, you don't.

916
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:44,744
Come on, Jeanie. Dinner's over.

917
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:46,704
Look, this isn't even our place.

918
01:02:46,804 --> 01:02:48,780
Well, let's ask Madge. Come on.

919
01:02:49,223 --> 01:02:51,125
- Stay there.
- I'm with Buddy.

920
01:02:51,225 --> 01:02:52,409
Oh, Christ.

921
01:02:54,562 --> 01:02:56,788
There's a lot of guys out there.

922
01:03:51,118 --> 01:03:53,521
Hey, come on outside.
I'd like to show you something.

923
01:03:53,621 --> 01:03:54,888
No, thanks. I've seen it.

924
01:04:16,310 --> 01:04:17,702
Now, listen.

925
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:19,714
- If you're going with a guy...
- Yeah?

926
01:04:19,814 --> 01:04:21,799
You can use a diaphragm.

927
01:04:21,899 --> 01:04:24,677
'Cause you got an idea
when you're doing it.

928
01:04:24,777 --> 01:04:28,890
But, on your own,
you better stick to the pill,

929
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:32,425
'cause you never know what
you don't know, you know?

930
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:58,669
No! They can't stay!

931
01:04:58,769 --> 01:05:00,046
You can't stay. I'm sorry.

932
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:01,830
It's okay. Don't be sorry.

933
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:04,666
Look, this is a private party, okay?

934
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:06,793
I'm just leaving.

935
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:14,718
Hey! You ready to go, darling?

936
01:05:15,828 --> 01:05:17,470
Yeah, he's ready to go.

937
01:05:23,628 --> 01:05:25,353
Dang you!

938
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:47,333
What's going on?

939
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:50,253
Get off the line!

940
01:05:51,322 --> 01:05:52,640
You bastard!

941
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:55,508
Get off the line! I'm trying to
call the police! Get off the line!

942
01:05:56,994 --> 01:05:58,595
You fucker!

943
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:16,279
Any injuries?

944
01:06:20,184 --> 01:06:22,003
Some items are harmed.

945
01:06:22,103 --> 01:06:23,588
Stereo equipment mostly,

946
01:06:23,688 --> 01:06:26,539
but nobody wants to remember who
stole them or where they went.

947
01:06:27,441 --> 01:06:30,376
Yes, they're right here,
the responsible party.

948
01:06:31,737 --> 01:06:35,131
No, we wanted to hold them
until we told you.

949
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:38,218
No, no, no, sir.

950
01:06:38,911 --> 01:06:40,553
It's your place.

951
01:06:41,622 --> 01:06:43,691
In that case, we'll hold
them for their parents,

952
01:06:43,791 --> 01:06:45,558
and give them a counsel and release.

953
01:06:46,377 --> 01:06:48,019
Again?

954
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:52,899
Mad, Mad Axman?

955
01:06:54,176 --> 01:06:55,735
Give me a spelling on that.

956
01:06:56,971 --> 01:06:58,113
Madge.

957
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:01,241
Axman.

958
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:06,037
Thank you.

959
01:07:08,649 --> 01:07:13,628
He wanted a Madge Axman to know he'd
be returning to the city in the morning.

960
01:07:16,991 --> 01:07:18,383
Hello, Frank.

961
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:20,510
- Working hard?
- No.

962
01:07:22,288 --> 01:07:24,097
What've we got here?

963
01:07:24,331 --> 01:07:27,276
Drunkenness, narcotics,
destruction of property.

964
01:07:27,376 --> 01:07:30,321
Some stolen goods, but the owner
doesn't want to press charges.

965
01:07:30,421 --> 01:07:32,564
I'm giving them all a
counsel and release.

966
01:07:33,132 --> 01:07:34,399
Is that your daughter?

967
01:07:41,265 --> 01:07:42,407
Bye, Ann.

968
01:07:51,358 --> 01:07:52,625
Stay there.

969
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:07,307
Drunkenness, narcotics,
destruction of property. What else?

970
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:09,517
They're cops, Mom.

971
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:14,031
I don't like your friends, Jeanie.

972
01:08:14,131 --> 01:08:15,356
I know that.

973
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:18,985
You'll have to tell me. Are there
any nice people left in the world?

974
01:08:19,386 --> 01:08:20,820
You never like my friends.

975
01:08:21,305 --> 01:08:24,073
Are there some nice boys,
nice girls, either one?

976
01:08:24,809 --> 01:08:26,752
- Yeah.
- What?

977
01:08:26,852 --> 01:08:28,462
Yeah. I said, yeah.

978
01:08:28,562 --> 01:08:30,506
Whatever happened to the word "yes"?

979
01:08:30,606 --> 01:08:33,092
For Christ's sake, Mom,
they're putting Annie in the hospital.

980
01:08:33,192 --> 01:08:34,635
You don't even care.

981
01:08:34,735 --> 01:08:38,305
I do care, and I'm sorry, darling.
I know Annie's basically a nice kid.

982
01:08:38,405 --> 01:08:39,932
You don't even know her.

983
01:08:40,032 --> 01:08:41,716
I know you're upset.

984
01:08:42,326 --> 01:08:43,978
She could die in that hospital.

985
01:08:44,078 --> 01:08:47,314
She could end up committing suicide.

986
01:08:47,414 --> 01:08:48,733
Did she say something about suicide?

987
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:50,860
She can't stand small spaces.

988
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,445
Did she actually say the word suicide?

989
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:54,938
No, but I know what she feels.

990
01:08:55,381 --> 01:08:56,490
Well, I'll call the hospital.

991
01:08:56,590 --> 01:08:59,035
Oh, God, that's not
going to do any good.

992
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:01,236
We'll ask the doctors,
what their opinion is.

993
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:03,748
They're the ones that are
saying Annie's sick.

994
01:09:03,848 --> 01:09:05,249
Their opinions are just sick.

995
01:09:05,349 --> 01:09:07,001
They're doctors.
At least we can ask their opinion.

996
01:09:07,101 --> 01:09:09,452
- Forget it! Just forget it.
- What?

997
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:13,883
Why, stop keep telling me
to say things over again.

998
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:15,333
It really bothers me.

999
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:18,836
"Forget it" is a very rude
thing to say to somebody.

1000
01:09:19,947 --> 01:09:24,717
Oh, God, you keep telling me to cry!
I don't want to cry anymore!

1001
01:09:27,204 --> 01:09:30,107
Maybe Annie is sick.
Did you ever think of that?

1002
01:09:30,207 --> 01:09:32,359
Maybe the whole bunch of you is sick.

1003
01:09:32,459 --> 01:09:35,404
You booze. You dope.
You sleep with whoever.

1004
01:09:35,504 --> 01:09:37,198
I don't even know who you are.

1005
01:09:37,298 --> 01:09:39,366
You look like kids,
but you don't act like 'em.

1006
01:09:39,466 --> 01:09:41,818
You're short 40-year-olds
and you're tough ones.

1007
01:09:42,344 --> 01:09:44,955
You just hate everybody since Dad left.

1008
01:09:45,055 --> 01:09:48,125
Everyone except some guy
you can just meet and...

1009
01:09:48,225 --> 01:09:49,701
What? Meet and what?

1010
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:52,546
You throw yourself on the
line all the time, Mom.

1011
01:09:52,646 --> 01:09:55,382
You jump on some guy and when he tells
you he doesn't want to see you anymore,

1012
01:09:55,482 --> 01:09:56,967
you just cry on the phone.

1013
01:09:57,067 --> 01:09:58,052
I don't care if you are my daughter.

1014
01:09:58,152 --> 01:09:59,845
You're not talking about me
or my friends like...

1015
01:09:59,945 --> 01:10:02,139
Well, you talk about
my friends that way!

1016
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:03,224
And you don't like Sam?

1017
01:10:03,324 --> 01:10:07,394
I don't know him! Do you?
Do you know him, Mom?

1018
01:10:07,494 --> 01:10:10,481
Did you know him before you just
jumped into bed with him like that?

1019
01:10:10,581 --> 01:10:15,486
That's nasty. That's cruel and
nasty and ugly and unloving,

1020
01:10:15,586 --> 01:10:17,321
and I wish I could punch you.

1021
01:10:17,421 --> 01:10:19,740
I wish to God I knew how to punch you.

1022
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:23,860
What's the matter with Sam?

1023
01:10:24,178 --> 01:10:25,913
He wears white shoes.

1024
01:10:26,013 --> 01:10:29,449
White shoes? You apologize!
You apologize!

1025
01:10:30,351 --> 01:10:32,744
I haven't finished. I'm not finished!

1026
01:10:33,354 --> 01:10:36,456
Just because they fit you for a
diaphragm doesn't make you a woman.

1027
01:10:41,612 --> 01:10:44,932
Sam is a good man, and you
make no mistake about that.

1028
01:10:45,032 --> 01:10:48,102
He's a decent human being
and he cares for me.

1029
01:10:48,202 --> 01:10:49,969
He says he even loves me.

1030
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:52,347
I'm going to spend some time with him.

1031
01:10:52,498 --> 01:10:54,775
A week, a few days. Who knows?

1032
01:10:54,875 --> 01:10:56,443
You want a place of your own?

1033
01:10:56,543 --> 01:11:00,021
Fine. Take this one, 'cause I'm
not gonna bring him here anymore.

1034
01:11:00,631 --> 01:11:02,575
All you girls are laughing at him.

1035
01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:05,119
There's too much music here
and too many boys, girls,

1036
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:08,497
laying all over the furniture,
half out of your clothes, on the floor!

1037
01:11:08,597 --> 01:11:11,208
You're too beautiful, all of you.

1038
01:11:11,308 --> 01:11:13,493
You make me hate my hips.

1039
01:11:14,436 --> 01:11:16,204
I hate my hips!

1040
01:12:00,607 --> 01:12:04,043
- I thought it was Jay.
- It's just me.

1041
01:12:04,278 --> 01:12:05,711
Jeanie.

1042
01:12:07,948 --> 01:12:10,967
- Where's Deirdre?
- Her mom won't let her come.

1043
01:12:11,952 --> 01:12:14,887
Stay away from trouble.
Something like that.

1044
01:12:17,291 --> 01:12:19,276
Well, shit on her.

1045
01:12:19,376 --> 01:12:22,061
She's not going to go
with us to see Annie?

1046
01:12:23,797 --> 01:12:24,939
No one is.

1047
01:12:25,424 --> 01:12:26,700
I talked to her mom.

1048
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:28,035
You talked to Gladys?

1049
01:12:28,135 --> 01:12:33,823
Yeah. She says no one can
visit her unless they're family.

1050
01:12:35,225 --> 01:12:37,544
Her dad doesn't want
her to see us anyway.

1051
01:12:37,644 --> 01:12:40,246
He's such a total drag.

1052
01:12:42,066 --> 01:12:44,417
I could scream, you know.

1053
01:12:47,279 --> 01:12:48,880
Well, it's not her fault.

1054
01:12:49,948 --> 01:12:53,227
Gladys is a nice lady,
once you get past her depressions.

1055
01:12:53,327 --> 01:12:56,137
What are we gonna do?

1056
01:13:05,631 --> 01:13:07,064
It's awful, huh?

1057
01:13:07,549 --> 01:13:09,150
It's not good.

1058
01:13:09,343 --> 01:13:11,986
We're gonna get jobs
and pay for the stereo.

1059
01:13:15,724 --> 01:13:17,418
I'm taking the proficiency exam

1060
01:13:17,518 --> 01:13:20,745
so I don't have to go to classes,
and I can work full-time.

1061
01:13:21,730 --> 01:13:23,590
They're gonna give me a certificate
so that I can show it...

1062
01:13:23,690 --> 01:13:25,458
Will you excuse us, please?

1063
01:13:27,069 --> 01:13:28,920
I can get into some colleges.

1064
01:13:29,196 --> 01:13:31,714
Some colleges, I can get into.

1065
01:13:38,622 --> 01:13:40,389
We're paying for everything.

1066
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:43,142
Doing what?

1067
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:45,904
Do you have any idea

1068
01:13:46,004 --> 01:13:49,607
what it's going to cost to put
this place back together again?

1069
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:52,202
Yes.

1070
01:13:52,302 --> 01:13:54,779
Yeah? How much?

1071
01:13:56,056 --> 01:13:58,625
Jay, you think
we're children, don't you?

1072
01:13:58,725 --> 01:14:00,586
I know you're children!

1073
01:14:00,686 --> 01:14:03,329
Living off your parents,
for Christ's sake.

1074
01:14:03,856 --> 01:14:05,632
I thought you loved me.

1075
01:14:05,732 --> 01:14:08,510
I thought age didn't matter.

1076
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:12,588
I do love you! I fucking worship you!

1077
01:14:15,075 --> 01:14:17,009
I must be nuts.

1078
01:14:18,412 --> 01:14:21,430
God! I must be nuts.

1079
01:14:25,169 --> 01:14:27,853
- I'll leave.
- Terrific.

1080
01:14:31,091 --> 01:14:33,827
You can stop wrecking things.
It's just gonna cost us more.

1081
01:14:33,927 --> 01:14:36,580
- What are you gonna do?
- Jay.

1082
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:38,874
What are you gonna do?
Be a waitress at Denny's?

1083
01:14:38,974 --> 01:14:39,958
Maybe!

1084
01:14:40,058 --> 01:14:42,743
Well, at that rate, it would take
you all about 80 years apiece!

1085
01:14:46,356 --> 01:14:48,749
I'll tell you one thing,
Mr. Jay Thompson.

1086
01:14:48,901 --> 01:14:52,888
The next time you see any of us
children coming through that door,

1087
01:14:52,988 --> 01:14:55,808
well, I'm gonna have
the money in my hand!

1088
01:14:55,908 --> 01:14:57,883
- Damn!
- What door?

1089
01:14:58,118 --> 01:14:59,885
This door!

1090
01:15:13,217 --> 01:15:17,111
I'm really pissed at you and all
your flaky teenage friends.

1091
01:15:18,096 --> 01:15:20,040
I'm not through talking to you.

1092
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:21,449
I am!

1093
01:15:22,392 --> 01:15:24,545
- Come back here.
- Why? So you can beat me up?

1094
01:15:24,645 --> 01:15:27,455
- You're goddamn right!
- Forget it.

1095
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:32,460
Please.

1096
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:36,380
- What?
- What do you mean, what?

1097
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:37,798
Please, what?

1098
01:15:38,992 --> 01:15:41,802
Please come back here
so I can beat you up.

1099
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:33,229
Hey!

1100
01:16:34,131 --> 01:16:36,366
I thought they had you
filling fire extinguishers.

1101
01:16:36,466 --> 01:16:38,202
Christmas is coming.

1102
01:16:38,302 --> 01:16:40,496
- Are you breaking for lunch sometime?
- No way.

1103
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:43,290
I thought maybe you'd want to
come with me and have some lunch.

1104
01:16:43,390 --> 01:16:44,490
All right.

1105
01:16:44,683 --> 01:16:45,959
Well, would they let you do that?

1106
01:16:46,059 --> 01:16:49,328
Are you kidding me?
This guy is paying shit.

1107
01:16:51,815 --> 01:16:55,000
You've got some white stuff
in your hair. Come here.

1108
01:16:59,906 --> 01:17:04,635
I thought you might be sad about Annie,
need someone to talk to.

1109
01:17:09,249 --> 01:17:12,736
I remember how incredibly sad you can
get about things and I thought that,

1110
01:17:12,836 --> 01:17:15,604
you know, you shouldn't have
to go through all that alone.

1111
01:17:16,214 --> 01:17:17,648
Thanks.

1112
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:23,738
Smell something?

1113
01:17:25,932 --> 01:17:27,491
It's my boots.

1114
01:17:27,768 --> 01:17:29,869
Well, what you been walking in?

1115
01:17:30,979 --> 01:17:34,415
I ran out of socks and that
makes my feet sweat a lot.

1116
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:37,803
God, that's awful. I mean, I'm sorry,
but you should get some socks.

1117
01:17:37,903 --> 01:17:39,754
Those boots are awful.

1118
01:17:47,079 --> 01:17:49,513
You didn't have to do that.

1119
01:18:27,119 --> 01:18:30,439
The trouble with LA is that everybody's
trying to act so supercool

1120
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:32,190
and into their own space.

1121
01:18:32,290 --> 01:18:34,568
Like they'd be ruined if
they had to feel anything.

1122
01:18:34,668 --> 01:18:36,403
I know, I used to be in yoga class.

1123
01:18:36,503 --> 01:18:38,071
God, this stuff is poison.

1124
01:18:38,171 --> 01:18:39,740
You don't know what they put in here.

1125
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:42,274
Yeah. What are you gonna do, right?

1126
01:18:44,219 --> 01:18:47,696
You know, nobody wants to feel
the pain in things anymore.

1127
01:18:48,682 --> 01:18:51,835
For instance, I can feel the
pain in things sometimes.

1128
01:18:51,935 --> 01:18:54,870
There's this one-eyed rooster I know.

1129
01:18:56,481 --> 01:18:59,875
Like some dog got to him
and bit a hole in his head.

1130
01:19:01,153 --> 01:19:04,880
Back in this place my dad used to take me,
when he was into the outdoors.

1131
01:19:05,407 --> 01:19:07,142
Some ranch, really, in the Sierras.

1132
01:19:07,242 --> 01:19:11,480
Bunch of stoner types, real spiritual heads,
always in some full lotus

1133
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:13,774
squatting their way to a
new head or something.

1134
01:19:13,874 --> 01:19:16,985
And this is really bullshit 'cause
there are all these rock-n-rollers

1135
01:19:17,085 --> 01:19:20,614
making lots of real heavy money
and they're om-ing up in the hills.

1136
01:19:20,714 --> 01:19:24,316
And I said, there's pain
in this rooster's head.

1137
01:19:25,552 --> 01:19:30,030
And they go, "Too much maya, man.
Too much maya."

1138
01:19:30,724 --> 01:19:32,825
Like pain's an illusion.

1139
01:19:33,435 --> 01:19:35,369
Like it isn't even real.

1140
01:19:36,146 --> 01:19:38,664
Christ. Illusion, right?

1141
01:19:39,733 --> 01:19:41,667
I wanted to laugh. It was...

1142
01:19:42,736 --> 01:19:46,881
It was like some church for these guys
sitting under these trees, you know?

1143
01:19:47,741 --> 01:19:51,260
I did something really gross.
My dad got so pissed.

1144
01:19:52,829 --> 01:19:55,055
I let this guy's tea...

1145
01:19:55,499 --> 01:19:59,810
Accidentally, right, this whole hot cup
of hot tea fall down this guy's leg.

1146
01:20:01,129 --> 01:20:04,023
He's sitting there
screaming and yelling.

1147
01:20:04,925 --> 01:20:08,861
He said he wasn't mad at me,
but it was a really stupid bitch thing to do.

1148
01:20:10,430 --> 01:20:15,576
Boy. He stopped talking
about pain being an illusion.

1149
01:20:33,578 --> 01:20:35,304
What are you thinking about?

1150
01:20:35,747 --> 01:20:37,056
About Annie.

1151
01:20:37,958 --> 01:20:39,350
What about Annie?

1152
01:20:40,210 --> 01:20:41,602
Just about Annie.

1153
01:21:20,834 --> 01:21:23,361
I guess it's too late
to go back to work.

1154
01:21:23,461 --> 01:21:24,937
It's no problem.

1155
01:21:26,673 --> 01:21:27,982
Sorry.

1156
01:21:35,515 --> 01:21:37,417
Was there angel dust in those joints?

1157
01:21:37,517 --> 01:21:38,826
No.

1158
01:21:39,603 --> 01:21:41,245
Sure you're not lying?

1159
01:21:41,521 --> 01:21:44,123
- Would I lie to you?
- Yeah.

1160
01:21:46,526 --> 01:21:49,044
I just, I can't handle it.

1161
01:21:50,322 --> 01:21:52,297
Angel dust, I mean.

1162
01:21:56,202 --> 01:21:57,803
Is that your phone ringing?

1163
01:21:58,413 --> 01:22:00,097
Nah, forget it.

1164
01:22:01,166 --> 01:22:02,433
Yeah.

1165
01:22:28,318 --> 01:22:29,543
Hello?

1166
01:22:30,612 --> 01:22:32,963
Annie. How are you?

1167
01:22:33,406 --> 01:22:34,766
Well, they let you phone from there?

1168
01:22:34,866 --> 01:22:37,018
Brad's here, I'll let you
talk to him in a minute.

1169
01:22:37,118 --> 01:22:40,637
What? Wait a minute! Where are you?

1170
01:22:41,081 --> 01:22:42,148
You're where?

1171
01:22:42,248 --> 01:22:45,142
Annie! Annie!

1172
01:22:51,633 --> 01:22:53,034
- Let's go. That's Annie.
- How is she?

1173
01:22:53,134 --> 01:22:54,234
She's loaded.

1174
01:23:25,083 --> 01:23:26,183
Jesus.

1175
01:23:41,057 --> 01:23:42,959
Come on, baby. You ready to leave?

1176
01:23:43,059 --> 01:23:46,578
- We're having a party.
- Doctor says no more parties, okay?

1177
01:23:50,984 --> 01:23:53,877
- Get me home.
- Okay.

1178
01:24:02,412 --> 01:24:04,731
- Excuse me.
- What did he say?

1179
01:24:04,831 --> 01:24:08,600
- "Excuse me."
- Why? What did he do?

1180
01:24:09,377 --> 01:24:12,396
Jimmy, what is this pile of shit?

1181
01:24:23,391 --> 01:24:24,867
Shootout.

1182
01:24:53,546 --> 01:24:55,480
- Your neck's bleeding.
- My neck!

1183
01:25:14,567 --> 01:25:17,470
I was so pissed I just walked out.

1184
01:25:17,570 --> 01:25:20,005
Right in the middle of visitors' hour.

1185
01:25:22,242 --> 01:25:24,927
With this girl's parents,
like I was the sister.

1186
01:25:26,037 --> 01:25:29,223
They gave me all this prescription
dope at the hospital.

1187
01:25:29,415 --> 01:25:31,151
What a trip, man.

1188
01:25:31,251 --> 01:25:33,727
Remember that? Jack Nicholson.

1189
01:25:34,087 --> 01:25:36,239
What a trip, man.

1190
01:25:36,339 --> 01:25:37,490
Can we sit down?

1191
01:25:37,590 --> 01:25:39,826
No. Look, would you
just walk off these pills?

1192
01:25:39,926 --> 01:25:42,287
'Cause otherwise you're gonna
end up going into a coma.

1193
01:25:42,387 --> 01:25:46,374
Was I happy to see you!
You were beautiful.

1194
01:25:46,474 --> 01:25:49,368
- You lie.
- You were my hero!

1195
01:25:49,936 --> 01:25:53,757
I saw you coming and I said,
"Hero, take me home."

1196
01:25:53,857 --> 01:25:55,175
You did not.

1197
01:25:55,275 --> 01:25:57,376
I was thinking it.

1198
01:25:58,486 --> 01:26:00,680
Yeah? You should've called, you know?

1199
01:26:00,780 --> 01:26:03,683
I did. I called forever!

1200
01:26:03,783 --> 01:26:06,093
I thought you'd be happy to see me.

1201
01:26:09,247 --> 01:26:11,390
- You got a lude?
- No, he doesn't.

1202
01:26:12,125 --> 01:26:13,860
You gonna be a total drag?

1203
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:16,071
I just shined one mother,
I don't need another.

1204
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:18,615
Okay, so you got a couple of
low characters for parents

1205
01:26:18,715 --> 01:26:21,066
and you think they can just fuck all.

1206
01:26:21,217 --> 01:26:22,494
Well, I can understand that.

1207
01:26:22,594 --> 01:26:25,538
But if you're just gonna get loaded
all the time and shine everybody,

1208
01:26:25,638 --> 01:26:27,665
well, shine you!
'Cause it's not working anymore!

1209
01:26:27,765 --> 01:26:31,461
Shine you, if that's how you feel!
I'm going to Oregon.

1210
01:26:31,561 --> 01:26:34,204
- Oregon?
- Bert's up there.

1211
01:26:34,397 --> 01:26:35,507
Another dirthead.

1212
01:26:35,607 --> 01:26:37,133
He's measuring trees.

1213
01:26:37,233 --> 01:26:39,719
Look, I'm living alone right now.
My mom moved out.

1214
01:26:39,819 --> 01:26:42,889
I don't know what the hell she's doing with
her life, but that's her business, okay?

1215
01:26:42,989 --> 01:26:44,891
I'm willing to take you on
for a couple of weeks

1216
01:26:44,991 --> 01:26:48,093
but not if you're just gonna go out and
get loaded all the time! You understand?

1217
01:26:49,621 --> 01:26:51,471
I'm going to Oregon.

1218
01:26:51,664 --> 01:26:54,234
You can't even walk with one
foot in front of the other!

1219
01:26:54,334 --> 01:26:55,434
Come on now, Annie.

1220
01:26:55,710 --> 01:26:58,103
Annie! Annie!

1221
01:26:59,714 --> 01:27:01,106
Annie!

1222
01:27:08,431 --> 01:27:09,990
Listen to me!

1223
01:27:10,934 --> 01:27:12,993
I'm getting real pissed! Stop!

1224
01:27:18,191 --> 01:27:20,927
Listen to me, god damn it! Listen to me!

1225
01:27:21,027 --> 01:27:22,720
If you're gonna stay with me,
you gotta go by the rules!

1226
01:27:22,820 --> 01:27:25,598
And the rules are we're gonna get
through this fucking high school!

1227
01:27:25,698 --> 01:27:28,935
We're gonna pay back Jay and get
jobs and a bunch of shit like that!

1228
01:27:29,035 --> 01:27:31,271
And if you don't like that,
that's just tough shit!

1229
01:27:31,371 --> 01:27:34,306
'Cause that's the way life is and
you better learn to eat a little!

1230
01:27:34,624 --> 01:27:38,935
And I'm not coming back for you
every time you goddamn blow it!

1231
01:27:46,552 --> 01:27:51,656
You know, no one can
take a joke anymore.

1232
01:28:00,441 --> 01:28:03,668
- It's my dad!
- No, it's a patrol car, Annie.

1233
01:28:04,028 --> 01:28:07,214
Annie! Annie, stay there.
Don't go far, okay?

1234
01:28:26,634 --> 01:28:29,361
- I want some ID.
- What for?

1235
01:28:30,847 --> 01:28:36,410
You're after curfew, this is a private
road and because I want it. You, too.

1236
01:28:54,787 --> 01:28:57,815
You're going home. We don't
want to see you up here again.

1237
01:28:57,915 --> 01:28:59,808
We've got your names.

1238
01:29:27,779 --> 01:29:31,256
Annie! Annie, where are you?

1239
01:29:32,033 --> 01:29:34,050
Was that my dad?

1240
01:29:34,952 --> 01:29:38,180
They're gone, Annie! They're all gone!
Where are you?

1241
01:29:43,127 --> 01:29:44,478
Here.

1242
01:30:13,533 --> 01:30:15,300
Where the fuck is she?

1243
01:30:15,868 --> 01:30:17,802
Hey, turkey! Here!

1244
01:30:25,002 --> 01:30:26,353
Come on!

1245
01:30:36,556 --> 01:30:38,490
Did you see that?

1246
01:30:44,230 --> 01:30:45,830
Oh, shit!

1247
01:30:53,072 --> 01:30:54,798
Get the guy! Try and get him!

1248
01:30:59,620 --> 01:31:01,429
Let him drive!

1249
01:31:37,575 --> 01:31:41,177
She thinks I'm putting her
in a spot if I just call her.

1250
01:31:42,538 --> 01:31:45,348
Like it's really stupid if I love her.

1251
01:31:50,838 --> 01:31:54,232
She keeps on saying, "You must be high."

1252
01:31:54,592 --> 01:31:56,244
Isn't that the rat's ass?

1253
01:31:56,344 --> 01:31:59,487
High? Just because I love her?

1254
01:31:59,889 --> 01:32:01,207
"That's the rules," she said.

1255
01:32:01,307 --> 01:32:05,410
I can't come over or see her
or anything if I'm high.

1256
01:32:06,229 --> 01:32:08,496
Oh, man. I just love her.

1257
01:32:09,690 --> 01:32:11,583
That's not high, huh?

1258
01:32:11,859 --> 01:32:12,969
No.

1259
01:32:13,069 --> 01:32:15,420
I've been in my car for three days now.

1260
01:32:16,322 --> 01:32:17,765
For real?

1261
01:32:17,865 --> 01:32:20,008
Well, you know, I stop to eat.

1262
01:32:22,036 --> 01:32:23,896
God, you're really bent up.

1263
01:32:23,996 --> 01:32:27,098
You girls think it's a joke
or something, being in love.

1264
01:32:29,377 --> 01:32:31,227
Are you sure we're going
to North Hollywood?

1265
01:32:31,629 --> 01:32:34,740
Well, actually, I was
going to Santa Monica.

1266
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:37,651
But I thought you might
want to go with me.

1267
01:32:37,843 --> 01:32:40,695
Thanks, man. But I really
gotta get to North Hollywood.

1268
01:32:43,182 --> 01:32:48,161
You know, I'm not like the rest of those
guys that are disrespectful to girls.

1269
01:32:49,814 --> 01:32:51,456
You better let me out.

1270
01:32:53,192 --> 01:32:54,668
Okay.

1271
01:33:02,827 --> 01:33:04,302
Thanks a lot, really.

1272
01:33:05,037 --> 01:33:06,429
Here, you want a pill?

1273
01:33:33,566 --> 01:33:35,333
Jeanie, be there!

1274
01:33:45,411 --> 01:33:49,681
Annie! Annie!

1275
01:33:54,086 --> 01:33:59,858
Annie!

1276
01:34:54,939 --> 01:34:56,664
Disappointed?

1277
01:35:12,498 --> 01:35:14,599
I know you wanted a place of your own.

1278
01:35:15,501 --> 01:35:18,478
It's okay, Mom. We sort of had one.

1279
01:35:20,131 --> 01:35:22,774
Sam wants me, it's not that.

1280
01:35:23,801 --> 01:35:25,443
He'd like me to stay.

1281
01:35:26,178 --> 01:35:27,403
What happened?

1282
01:35:28,222 --> 01:35:30,198
I couldn't move my robe in there.

1283
01:35:30,933 --> 01:35:33,243
The place was too nice for my robe.

1284
01:35:34,478 --> 01:35:37,497
Annie's left the hospital and
we don't know where she is.

1285
01:35:42,111 --> 01:35:43,628
She'll be back.

1286
01:35:44,196 --> 01:35:45,922
I don't know.

1287
01:36:05,593 --> 01:36:06,943
You want a ride?

1288
01:36:08,679 --> 01:36:10,280
Are you going to North Hollywood?

1289
01:36:11,599 --> 01:36:13,292
Are we going to North Hollywood?

1290
01:36:13,392 --> 01:36:15,660
Yeah. Let's go to North Hollywood.

1291
01:36:24,236 --> 01:36:27,463
- Sure you're going that way?
- Sure.

1292
01:36:30,576 --> 01:36:31,801
Hi.

1293
01:36:38,918 --> 01:36:40,361
I'm Daryl.

1294
01:36:40,461 --> 01:36:42,353
This is my wife, Bert.

1295
01:36:43,005 --> 01:36:44,397
Yeah?

1296
01:36:45,090 --> 01:36:47,025
You think that's a strange name?

1297
01:36:47,593 --> 01:36:49,152
It's strange.

1298
01:36:49,512 --> 01:36:50,820
Here. Hold this.

1299
01:36:51,764 --> 01:36:53,332
Hey, watch your driving.

1300
01:36:53,432 --> 01:36:54,866
Grab onto that.

1301
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:57,744
Here, grab the wheel.

1302
01:37:05,319 --> 01:37:07,378
You guys are weird.

1303
01:37:07,947 --> 01:37:09,598
Did you hear that?

1304
01:37:09,698 --> 01:37:12,175
Come on. Why are you so uptight?
We like you.

1305
01:37:16,455 --> 01:37:18,056
Why don't you relax?

1306
01:37:18,666 --> 01:37:20,985
- I gotta get to Jeanie's.
- Who's Jeanie?

1307
01:37:21,085 --> 01:37:22,352
Come on, relax.

1308
01:37:23,796 --> 01:37:26,356
The beast with five fingers.

1309
01:37:43,774 --> 01:37:46,376
- Wanna turn up the IV's?
- Don't.

1310
01:37:47,194 --> 01:37:48,596
Those are Jeanie's pants.

1311
01:37:48,696 --> 01:37:50,681
- Now, it's okay.
- Pressures dropped.

1312
01:37:50,781 --> 01:37:52,507
Pressure's dropping.

1313
01:37:56,495 --> 01:37:58,262
She's going out of it here.

1314
01:38:04,753 --> 01:38:06,270
- Turn up the IV.
- All right.

1315
01:38:07,131 --> 01:38:09,825
Take it easy. Take it easy.
It'll be okay.

1316
01:38:09,925 --> 01:38:11,150
Slow that down, good.

1317
01:38:12,094 --> 01:38:14,445
That's good. That's good.

1318
01:38:18,183 --> 01:38:20,535
She's spitting up blood.

1319
01:38:40,414 --> 01:38:41,556
We've lost her.

1320
01:38:54,595 --> 01:38:56,863
We gotta wake up Annie.

1321
01:39:13,656 --> 01:39:16,090
You sure piss me off sometimes, Annie.

1322
01:39:51,568 --> 01:39:54,096
I can't go on without you all!

1323
01:39:54,196 --> 01:39:56,557
- How does it feel, married woman?
- I'm terrified!

1324
01:39:56,657 --> 01:39:58,925
- You hear that?
- Good-bye!

1325
01:40:00,828 --> 01:40:02,929
Goodbye! Dad!

1326
01:40:04,164 --> 01:40:05,473
Here you go!

1327
01:40:21,890 --> 01:40:23,626
I'll come out later, okay?

1328
01:40:23,726 --> 01:40:24,710
Where're you going?

1329
01:40:24,810 --> 01:40:27,713
We've got to go over to Stan's.
It's some real heavy family stuff.

1330
01:40:27,813 --> 01:40:29,256
Otherwise I'd go with you now, you know?

1331
01:40:29,356 --> 01:40:31,383
- Really.
- Okay.

1332
01:40:31,483 --> 01:40:33,501
- Bye, Mary.
- Bye.

1333
01:40:44,580 --> 01:40:46,514
You want me to drive up there with you?

1334
01:40:47,499 --> 01:40:50,810
If you want.

1335
01:40:52,546 --> 01:40:55,324
I don't want to tell you that you can't.

1336
01:40:55,424 --> 01:40:58,619
Well, tell me the truth. My God,
you're on your way to college.

1337
01:40:58,719 --> 01:40:59,954
You're gonna be on your own.

1338
01:41:00,054 --> 01:41:03,156
The least we can do is be
honest at this point, can't we?

1339
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:06,919
I don't know. Things get so complicated.

1340
01:41:07,019 --> 01:41:09,829
I think we'd be better off if we didn't
call each other mother and daughter.

1341
01:41:10,314 --> 01:41:13,050
I'd rather go alone.
I mean, that's the truth.

1342
01:41:13,150 --> 01:41:16,377
I like calling you mom. Okay?

1343
01:41:17,321 --> 01:41:18,931
- Okay.
- Okay.

1344
01:41:19,031 --> 01:41:21,308
I know that the subject
doesn't come up too often.

1345
01:41:21,408 --> 01:41:24,353
We never really get the chance
to talk about it, but...

1346
01:41:24,453 --> 01:41:26,220
I really love you.

1347
01:41:28,832 --> 01:41:31,434
I love you, too, honey.

1348
01:42:32,938 --> 01:42:36,175
Back in the heavy stoned days when
we used to stay up and talk a lot,

1349
01:42:36,275 --> 01:42:39,178
Annie and me,
we were talking about dying.

1350
01:42:39,278 --> 01:42:40,846
How it feels and all.

1351
01:42:40,946 --> 01:42:43,557
I said I'd never get buried.

1352
01:42:43,657 --> 01:42:46,268
I couldn't stand them
shoveling dirt in my face.

1353
01:42:46,368 --> 01:42:47,352
Like I'd know I'd be dead,

1354
01:42:47,452 --> 01:42:51,222
but I still might have this strong
compulsion to breathe, okay?

1355
01:42:51,874 --> 01:42:53,400
But Annie,

1356
01:42:53,500 --> 01:42:57,696
she said she wanted to be buried
right in the ground under a pear tree.

1357
01:42:57,796 --> 01:43:00,991
Really. Not in a box or anything.

1358
01:43:01,091 --> 01:43:03,410
She said she wanted the roots
going right through her.

1359
01:43:03,510 --> 01:43:07,430
And each year, we'd come along
and take a pear and go,

1360
01:43:07,431 --> 01:43:11,951
"Hey, Annie's tasting
good this year, huh?"
