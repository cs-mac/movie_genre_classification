00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,071
I can't tell you how much
we admire that.

465
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,300
But what we do

466
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,340
is negotiate,

467
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,940
demonstrate,

468
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,140
resist.

469
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,260
And a big part of that

470
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,460
is raising white consciousness.

471
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,020
And in particular the consciousness

472
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,905
of whichever white man happens
to be sitting in the Oval Office.

473
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:26,029
Right now, Johnson has other fish to fry
and he'll ignore us if he can.

474
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,740
The only way to stop him doing that

475
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,671
is by being on the front page
of the national press every morning

476
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,980
and by being on the TV news every night.

477
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,262
And that requires

I've been told the sheriff in this town
isn't like Laurie Pritchett in Albany.

484
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,349
He's a big ignorant bully
like Bull Connor in Birmingham.

485

Well, you tell me. You know Selma.

486

You know Sheriff Jim Clark.

487
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,180
Is he Laurie Pritchett?

488
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,621
Or is he Bull Connor?

489
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,221
He's Bull Connor.

493
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:41,220
See, Clark doesn't control the streets
like Connor did in Birmingham.

494
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,540
Clark's the County Sheriff,

495
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,780
and all he controls in Selma
is the County Courthouse.

496

See, in Albany, there were
no clearly defined battle zones.

504
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,620
The issue was segregation,

505
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,020
and segregation was everywhere.

506
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:08,226
In Selma, we can concentrate
our actions on one building.

to these people then, sir?

A lot of work has been done here,

But your local sheriff here?
He doesn't know that.

675

So allow me to be the alternative
to your husband.

about us in the past, Coretta?

682
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:39,980
He called us "ignorant Negro preachers."

683

Called me a modern day Uncle Tom.

684
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:45,060
Said on national television
that the white man pays me

685
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:48,260
to keep Negroes defenseless.

686
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:51,304
The white man pays me!

687

How could you allow it?

688

I'm telling you...

689

with banning these laws that

891

if a Negro tries to register,

892
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:01,071
I mean, actually musters up
the courage to go in that courthouse,

893
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:04,740
that their name and address
is published in the paper.

894
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:07,180
It gives anybody who wants
to do them any harm

930
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:32,460
A march from Selma to Montgomery
to protest and amplify.

931
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:34,500
Well, I'll be damned.

932
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:36,980
This was always
part of the plan, wasn't it?

933
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:40,104
Provoke some tragedy
in little old Selma, then go big.

934
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:44,068
Get someone killed
and march on the State Capitol!

935
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:47,060
Selma to Montgomery's gotta be 50 miles!

936
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:49,860
You march those people
into rural Alabama unprotected,

937
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:51,100
it's gonna be open season.

938
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,620
It's too damn far
and too damn dangerous!

939
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:55,580
Then propose new legislation, sir.

940
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:58,431
I can't do that this year.
I won't! I told you.

941
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:00,820
We need your involvement here,
Mr. President.

942
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:03,540
We deserve your help
as citizens of this country.

943
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:04,700
Citizens under attack.

944
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:07,900
Now, you listen to me. You listen to me.

945
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,860
You're an activist. I'm a politician.

946
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:12,540
You got one big issue.
I got a hundred and one.

947
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,580
Now, you demanding more

948
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:17,020
and putting me on the spot
with this visit, that's okay.

949
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:18,860
That's your job. That's what you do.

950
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:21,500
But I am sick and tired

951
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:23,860
of you demanding and telling me

952
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:26,260
what I can and what I can't do.

953

If you want my support
on this voting thing,

954

I need some quid pro quo from you.

What do you want, Mr. President?

956
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:36,108
We have a line on
some threats that are, uh...

957
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:38,420
particularly troubling.

958
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:40,220
Well, what's new?

959
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:44,900
No, no. This is serious.
Credible threats with detail.

The same high-level

Bugging our homes and our hotel rooms.

Can't or won't?

I came here hoping
to talk to you about people.

01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:07,390
While rageful violence continues
towards the unarmed people of Selma,

1229
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:13,380
while they are assaulted with tear gas
and batons like an enemy in a war,

1230
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:17,020
no citizen of this country
can call themselves blameless,

1231
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:20,906
for we all bear a responsibility
for our fellow man.

1232
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:24,420
I am appealing to men and women of God

1233
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:26,500
and goodwill everywhere,

1234
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:28,900
white, black and otherwise.

1235
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:34,740
If you believe all are created equal,
come to Selma.

1236
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:39,389
Join us. Join our march
against injustice and inhumanity.

1237
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:41,950
We need you to stand with us.

Dr. King's call-to-action

1239
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:49,389
was nationally televised.

1240
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:54,620
We've seen hundreds of people travel across
the country to attend tomorrow's march,

1241
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:58,905
mostly white,
mostly clergy of some kind.

1242
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:03,500
The SCLC is seeking
a federal court order

1243
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:07,068
enjoining the state authorities
from interfering with the next march.

1244
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:10,500
You're asking me to overturn
the Governor's mandate

1245
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:12,620
and to do so without a hearing,

1246
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:16,020
but it's not going to happen at all
without a proper proceeding.

1247
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:19,060
Dr. King is in position
to lead tomorrow's march, Judge.

1248
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:23,140
Understood, but you will have
your day in court on Thursday, Mr. Gray.

1249
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:26,020
Meanwhile, there will be
no march tomorrow.

1250
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:28,746
I will not oppose Wallace
against protocol.

1251
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:32,984
"Thousands head south in moral crusade."

1252

<font color="#808080">WHITE:</font> The SCLC already filed an appeal

1253

against Wallace's orders this morning.

1254
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:45,628
You want my advice, Mr. President?

1255
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:47,545
You have to ask?

1256
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:50,624
Give King the march to Montgomery.

1257
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:55,663
Do that, and then Selma's over.

1258
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,220
Then you're back in control.

1259
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:00,300
In control of what?

1260
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:02,260
Another civil war?

1261
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:03,980
This ain't about the goddamn march.

1262
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:05,780
You think he cares about the march?

1263
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:08,586
He wants the law changed, now.

1264
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:10,540
I've got Congress
calling me by the dozens.

1265
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:13,140
I've got picketing that gets
bigger and bigger every day.

1266
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:15,911
He tugs on their goddamn
white liberal conscience.

1267
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:19,941
Every march pulls 'em. Especially when
people are getting beat up in the streets.

1268
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:26,306
These pictures are going
around the world, Lee.

1269
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:28,500
I understand, Mr. President.

1270
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:30,180
All the more reason to act now.

1271
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:31,427
I'm gonna act now.

1272
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:34,860
You tell Wallace
and those backwater hicks

1273
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:37,020
I don't want to see
any more of this horseshit.

1274
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:40,220
And you tell King he best not march,
you hear me?

1275
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:43,740
Either King stops and Wallace stops,

1276
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:45,860
or I'll stop 'em both.

1277
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:49,507
I'm here on the President's order
to try and make this work.

1278
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:52,305
Please work with me.

1279
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:55,423
So we give up the march and you...

1280
01:22:56,360 --> 01:22:57,825
You give what?

1281
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:00,180
We asked for federal protection.

1282
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:03,300
And with no disrespect, but when
the Assistant Attorney General

1283
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:05,460
is the highest-ranking
federal official in Selma,

1284
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:07,740
we have our answer.

1285
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:09,100
And it's not the one we want.

1286
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:13,900
Might I suggest that you
speak with Governor Wallace

1287
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,620
and Sheriff Clark
and urge them against violence

1288
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:18,460
instead of trying to persuade us

1289
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:20,469
not to have a peaceful protest?

1290
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:28,263
Maybe we can make a deal.

1291
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:31,190
What if I

1292
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:36,229
could assure you that the administration
would endorse a later march

1293
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:38,625
if tomorrow is called off?

1294
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:44,345
You know what?
He's closer than you may think

1295
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:46,941
to coming around on this issue.

1296
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:50,660
I believe this compromise
might be agreeable.

and all you have sacrificed
for this struggle.

1382

the faith you once had in me.

01:43:01,480 --> 01:43:02,860
v. the state of Alabama,

1530
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:06,621
I will now hear testimony
from the plaintiffs. Mr. Gray.

1531
01:43:07,680 --> 01:43:10,020
Your Honor, you will hear
testimony from the victims

1532
01:43:10,120 --> 01:43:12,905
who were beaten and bludgeoned
in their quest for freedom.

1533
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:16,625
For their right to vote
and to self-determine.

1534
01:43:17,120 --> 01:43:18,220
The fact of the matter, Your Honor,

1535
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:21,390
is that the incidents that occurred
cannot be disputed.

1536
01:43:21,720 --> 01:43:24,221
These particular circumstances

1537
01:43:24,640 --> 01:43:30,190
will paint a thorough picture
of the horrific events endured in Selma.

1538
01:43:30,760 --> 01:43:32,940
Very well, you may proceed.

1539
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:37,270
Mr. King, you went out on that bridge
in direct violation of that judge's orders.

1540
01:43:37,880 --> 01:43:41,382
You deliberately disobeyed this judge
and the Governor, did you not?

1541
01:43:42,600 --> 01:43:45,700
Thousands of people came to Selma,

1542
01:43:45,800 --> 01:43:48,870
aroused by Sunday's brutal acts

1543
01:43:49,160 --> 01:43:52,820
exacted by officials
of the city of Selma

1544
01:43:52,920 --> 01:43:54,740
and the state of Alabama.

1545
01:43:54,840 --> 01:43:57,900
I felt if I had not led the march,

1546
01:43:58,000 --> 01:43:59,980
pent-up emotions and inner tensions

1547
01:44:00,080 --> 01:44:04,469
would have led to an uncontrollable
retaliatory situation,

1548
01:44:05,760 --> 01:44:08,460
a violent situation on both sides.

1549
01:44:08,560 --> 01:44:10,100
I don't need any of your preaching
and prancing in here,

1550
01:44:10,200 --> 01:44:11,420
you hear? I want an answer.

1551
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:12,780
Objection.

1552
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:14,141
Watch it, counselor.

1553
01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:15,900
I'm trying very hard, Judge.

1554
01:44:16,160 --> 01:44:17,625
Try harder, counselor.

1555
01:44:23,200 --> 01:44:26,380
It seems basic
to our constitutional principles

1556
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:29,789
that the extent
of the right to assemble,

1557
01:44:30,480 --> 01:44:32,220
and demonstrate and march

1558
01:44:32,320 --> 01:44:34,340
along the highway in a peaceful manner

1559
01:44:34,440 --> 01:44:35,700
ought to be commensurate

1560
01:44:35,800 --> 01:44:38,300
with the enormity of the wrongs

1561
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:40,821
that are being protested
and petitioned against.

1562
01:44:41,640 --> 01:44:46,268
In this case, the wrongs are enormous.

1563
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:49,866
Therefore,

1564
01:44:50,760 --> 01:44:53,980
the extent of the right to demonstrate

1565
01:44:54,080 --> 01:44:57,662
in an estimated five-day march
from Selma to Montgomery

1566
01:44:58,240 --> 01:45:00,024
has been approved accordingly.

Well, Mr. President...

1588
01:46:21,400 --> 01:46:23,820
Malcontents are disrupting Alabama,

1589
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:27,308
and it's your responsibility
to stop them.

1590
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,660
They're protesting
about the right to vote

1591
01:46:30,760 --> 01:46:34,100
and the way they're treated
in your state.

1592
01:46:34,200 --> 01:46:38,380
So that's your problem,
your responsibility,

and it's on your watch.

01:46:41,120 --> 01:46:43,268
Mr. President, I disagree.

1595
01:46:43,800 --> 01:46:47,180
We have a certain way things are done.
It's the way it is.

1596
01:46:47,280 --> 01:46:49,587
And it's the way
the people want it to stay.

1597
01:46:51,640 --> 01:46:53,900
George, why are you doing this?

1598
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:55,860
Your whole career
has been working for the poor.

1599
01:46:55,960 --> 01:46:57,744
Why are you off on this black thing?

1600
01:46:58,160 --> 01:47:00,911
Well, 'cause you can't ever
satisfy them.

1601
01:47:01,880 --> 01:47:03,740
First, it's the front seat of the bus.

1602
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:06,460
Next, it's take over the parks,

1603
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:08,300
then it's the public schools,

1604
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:11,060
then it's voting, then it's jobs,

1605
01:47:11,160 --> 01:47:14,423
then it's distribution
of wealth without work.

1606
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:18,900
George, you seen all those demonstrators

1607
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:20,260
out front of the White House

1608
01:47:20,360 --> 01:47:22,540
keeping my Lady Bird awake
the whole damn night?

1609
01:47:22,640 --> 01:47:24,580
Oh, yes, Mr. President. I saw them.

1610
01:47:24,680 --> 01:47:27,540
Well, let's go out there, you and I,

1611
01:47:27,640 --> 01:47:31,142
and announce that you've decided
to let the blacks vote undeterred,

1612
01:47:31,720 --> 01:47:33,420
and this whole mess will go away.

1613
01:47:33,520 --> 01:47:36,624
And I don't have to draft bills
or force the issue.

1614
01:47:37,720 --> 01:47:39,780
Now, why don't we do that, George?

1615
01:47:39,880 --> 01:47:42,824
Why don't you just let the niggers vote?

1616
01:47:43,560 --> 01:47:45,660
You agree they got
the right to vote, don't you?

1617
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:47,580
Oh, there's no quarrel with that.

1618
01:47:47,680 --> 01:47:49,862
I know that. That's the law.

1619
01:47:50,720 --> 01:47:52,629
Then why don't you just let 'em vote?

1620
01:47:52,920 --> 01:47:54,460
I don't have that power.

1621
01:47:54,560 --> 01:47:56,420
It belongs to the county registrars.

1622
01:47:56,520 --> 01:47:58,827
Now, don't shit me
about who runs Alabama.

1623
01:48:00,040 --> 01:48:04,500
I don't have any legal power
over the county registrars, Mr. President.

1624
01:48:04,600 --> 01:48:06,828
They have their regulations
and they adhere.

1625
01:48:07,400 --> 01:48:09,787
Are you trying to shit me,
George Wallace?

1626
01:48:10,240 --> 01:48:12,500
Are you trying
to fuck over your President?

1627
01:48:12,600 --> 01:48:13,780
Mr. President...

1628
01:48:13,880 --> 01:48:16,100
We shouldn't even
be thinking about 1965.

1629
01:48:16,200 --> 01:48:19,031
We should be thinking about 1985.

1630
01:48:19,600 --> 01:48:21,862
You and I'll be both dead
and gone by then.

1631
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:25,140
In 1985, what do you want looking back?

1632
01:48:25,240 --> 01:48:26,980
You want people remembering you sayin',

1633
01:48:27,080 --> 01:48:31,583
"Wait," or "I can't,"
or, uh... "It's too hard"?

1634
01:48:34,400 --> 01:48:36,820
I don't right care what they think,

1635
01:48:36,920 --> 01:48:39,421
and you shouldn't neither.

1636
01:48:44,720 --> 01:48:46,026
Well...

1637
01:48:47,320 --> 01:48:49,420

I speak tonight for the dignity of man

1640

and the destiny of democracy.

1641

At times, history and fate

1643
01:49:13,160 --> 01:49:18,221
So it was last week in Selma, Alabama.

1644
01:49:19,400 --> 01:49:22,504
There, long suffering men and women

1645
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:28,380
peacefully protested the denial
of their rights as Americans.

1646
01:49:28,480 --> 01:49:30,580
Rarely in any time

1647
01:49:30,680 --> 01:49:34,023

1648
01:49:34,880 --> 01:49:36,948
of America itself.

1649
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:42,340
The issue for equal rights
for the American Negro

1650
01:49:42,440 --> 01:49:43,826
is that issue.

1651
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:46,101
For this issue,

1652
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:50,104
many of them were brutally assaulted.

1653
01:49:54,480 --> 01:49:58,665
There is no Negro problem.
There is no Southern problem.

1654
01:49:59,640 --> 01:50:02,740
There is only an American problem.

But, today, the sun is shining,

who worked hard to get us here.

I may not be with them
for all the sunny days to come,

is light ahead for them,
