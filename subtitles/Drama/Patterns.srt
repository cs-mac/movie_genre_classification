1
00:01:58,391 --> 00:01:59,635
Good morning, Miss Lanier.

2
00:02:00,139 --> 00:02:02,198
If you're this early, you'll
have to take the local.

3
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,379
Alright, Phil.

4
00:02:14,435 --> 00:02:16,658
20th floor Executive, Miss Lanier.
─ Thank you, Phil.

5
00:02:21,789 --> 00:02:23,839
Good morning, Miss Lanier.
─ Good morning, Martha.

6
00:02:23,997 --> 00:02:26,504
I couldn't find a cab anywhere.
─ Such a lovely day, though.

7
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,693
40th Floor Executive. Ramsey
& Company. Miss Stevens.

8
00:02:35,277 --> 00:02:37,659
I'm sorry sir, our switchboard
doesn't open until nine.

9
00:02:37,975 --> 00:02:40,047
You will be able to reach
him shortly thereafter

10
00:02:40,422 --> 00:02:41,037
Ann.

11
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,456
That's correct, sir.

12
00:02:43,734 --> 00:02:45,678
Mr Staples begins with
the company today.

13
00:02:46,324 --> 00:02:48,063
I'll leave your message on his desk.

14
00:02:49,331 --> 00:02:51,399
Ann, would you put this on
Mr Staples's desk, please.

15
00:02:51,499 --> 00:02:52,325
Yes, ma'am.

16
00:02:52,425 --> 00:02:55,344
Mr Staples will be in Mr Quinn's
old office, Executive Corridor.

17
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,484
Yes, I know.

18
00:02:57,964 --> 00:03:00,846
I said deliver it, not read it.
─ Yes, ma'am.

19
00:03:04,294 --> 00:03:06,643
Executive. 40th Floor. Miss Stevens.

20
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:13,617
Morning.
─ Hi.

21
00:03:13,856 --> 00:03:14,929
Good morning, madam.

22
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:17,279
What did Margie say?
She's to go to work next door?

23
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:18,323
Oh no.

24
00:03:18,649 --> 00:03:20,481
Well I'm glad I don't.
─ Not there.

25
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,871
Well, they really fixed up a new
Exec's office for him, didn't they.

26
00:03:25,476 --> 00:03:26,263
Very nice.

27
00:03:26,867 --> 00:03:27,772
A new man.

28
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,864
Right next door to your boss.

29
00:03:30,262 --> 00:03:32,409
And awfully close to Mr Ramsey.

30
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:34,684
It so happens that the new man.

31
00:03:35,317 --> 00:03:36,275
What's his name?

32
00:03:36,786 --> 00:03:37,991
Staples?
─ Uhuh.

33
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:39,689
Will be working with Mr Briggs.

34
00:03:40,212 --> 00:03:41,714
They try to have adjoining offices.

35
00:03:42,045 --> 00:03:44,543
Marjorie baby, you're awfully defensive.

36
00:03:46,364 --> 00:03:48,651
I guess that's because you're
worried about your Mr Briggs.

37
00:03:49,953 --> 00:03:51,026
Run along, will you.

38
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:55,820
May I have some more cream, please?

39
00:04:16,184 --> 00:04:18,841
Next car, please. Next car.
Next car, please. Okay.

40
00:04:19,817 --> 00:04:20,658
Next car.

41
00:04:23,816 --> 00:04:27,350
Harry, Charlie, Joe. Express down.
No stops. We're jammed.

42
00:04:37,378 --> 00:04:39,503
Next car, please. Next car. Next car.

43
00:04:40,236 --> 00:04:42,243
Good morning, Mr Ramsey.
Next car, please.

44
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,599
Thank you, Lenny.
─ Yes, sir.

45
00:04:54,957 --> 00:04:56,494
"<i>Miss Lanier. We've seen him</i>."

46
00:04:56,899 --> 00:04:58,372
"<i>He's here</i>."
─ Thank you, Martha.

47
00:05:02,925 --> 00:05:04,142
Chief operator, please.

48
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,865
Miss Phillips, you can put those three
long-distance calls through to Mr Ramsey.

49
00:05:09,137 --> 00:05:11,179
Portland, Dallas, St Louis offices.

50
00:05:16,002 --> 00:05:18,205
Good morning, Mr Ramsey.
─ Good morning, Miss Lanier.

51
00:05:22,117 --> 00:05:22,989
Any messages?

52
00:05:23,191 --> 00:05:25,750
You have calls place for our
Portland, Dallas and St Louis offices.

53
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,220
Nothing else important, sir.

54
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,201
Martin Tool & Die.
You said you'd wired him.

55
00:05:29,474 --> 00:05:31,126
Yes, you'll find a copy in my briefcase.

56
00:05:32,058 --> 00:05:33,795
You are right as usual.
Nothing important.

57
00:05:34,869 --> 00:05:36,871
I have the Portland
report in my briefcase.

58
00:05:37,412 --> 00:05:39,277
I want it teletyped this
morning to Seattle.

59
00:05:39,947 --> 00:05:43,053
Have someone there drive over to Portland
and get it to Johnson before lunch.

60
00:05:43,691 --> 00:05:45,854
Then run off 20 copies,
confidential mimeographing.

61
00:05:45,954 --> 00:05:47,819
Have them ready in time
for the board meeting.

62
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,106
I want it on the agenda.

63
00:05:50,427 --> 00:05:52,840
Has Mr Staples arrived yet?
─ Not yet, sir.

64
00:05:53,878 --> 00:05:55,745
Delay the meeting until
ten this morning.

65
00:05:55,845 --> 00:05:58,201
To give you time to get the
report mimeo'd and distributed.

66
00:05:58,754 --> 00:06:00,362
I want it read, and carefully.

67
00:06:01,096 --> 00:06:02,905
Get word underground
to the secretaries ..

68
00:06:03,005 --> 00:06:05,403
That no-one can count on making
any early luncheon appointments.

69
00:06:05,891 --> 00:06:06,849
And make a note.

70
00:06:07,358 --> 00:06:10,178
Staples is to sit one down
from Vandeventer on my left.

71
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:11,508
Yes sir.

72
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,509
Let me know as soon
as Mr Staples arrives.

73
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:15,664
Yes, Mr Ramsey.

74
00:06:46,974 --> 00:06:49,098
Well, Fred .. here we are.

75
00:06:49,873 --> 00:06:50,966
Yeah, here we are.

76
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:53,359
A little different
to Mansfield, isn't it.

77
00:06:53,935 --> 00:06:57,457
Now I know what a mother feels when her
child goes to school for the first time.

78
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:58,884
Well, goodbye, mother.

79
00:06:59,734 --> 00:07:01,156
It looks <i>big</i>, doesn't it.

80
00:07:01,576 --> 00:07:04,391
Well, give me a chance, honey.
Maybe I can cut it down to my size.

81
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:08,108
And I'm a little late.
─ Shall I call you when I ..

82
00:07:08,382 --> 00:07:11,409
No, no, no. You go on home
after you've finished shopping.

83
00:07:11,726 --> 00:07:14,356
And find a garage somewhere
around mid-town to park the car.

84
00:07:14,693 --> 00:07:17,430
I'll phone you on what
train I'll be on. Bye bye.

85
00:07:21,176 --> 00:07:22,303
Goodbye, darling.

86
00:07:42,143 --> 00:07:44,078
Ramsey & Company, the board room ..

87
00:07:44,288 --> 00:07:45,877
Yes, sir. Executive or Administrative?

88
00:07:46,285 --> 00:07:48,821
The Executive. Mr Ramsey.
─ 40th floor, sir.

89
00:07:49,737 --> 00:07:51,260
Morning. Morning.

90
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:54,055
Oh, you want the tower, sir.

91
00:07:55,822 --> 00:07:57,231
The tower elevator, sir.

92
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,820
It will be down in a minute.
─ Oh.

93
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:02,059
Sorry. Thank you.
─ My pleasure, sir.

94
00:08:03,335 --> 00:08:05,551
Good morning, Ed. Good morning.
─ Good morning.

95
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:08,452
Good morning. Good morning.

96
00:08:08,998 --> 00:08:10,859
Good morning, Jamie.
─ Good morning, Bill.

97
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,843
Morning, Marge. How was the weekend?
─ Fine.

98
00:08:14,943 --> 00:08:17,262
Letters are on your desk. The
coffee cart is here any minute.

99
00:08:17,362 --> 00:08:19,556
I can use some coffee.
─ Didn't you get any rest at all?

100
00:08:19,656 --> 00:08:22,790
Couldn't even take my kind to the
double-header.   ─ What a shame.

101
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:25,553
That planning report is going
to be a real job, Marge.

102
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,838
This will be a big week for
you too, with that thing.

103
00:08:28,188 --> 00:08:30,573
I believe we'll try a rough first draft.
─ Long?

104
00:08:30,881 --> 00:08:32,529
No longer than the telephone directory.

105
00:08:32,891 --> 00:08:33,821
Phew!

106
00:08:34,761 --> 00:08:35,434
Marge.

107
00:08:37,895 --> 00:08:39,444
Has Mr Staples come in yet, Marge?

108
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,809
No, sir.

109
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:44,279
Mr Staples?
─ Yes.

110
00:08:44,379 --> 00:08:46,190
I'm Margaret Lanier,
Mr Ramsey's secretary.

111
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:47,661
Oh, how do you do.

112
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:51,609
Mr Ramsey would be here to welcome you
himself but he has a long distance call.

113
00:08:52,046 --> 00:08:53,731
May <i>I</i> take you back to your office?

114
00:08:53,896 --> 00:08:55,112
Why, thank you very much.

115
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,700
And on our way, I might show you
some of our other departments.

116
00:08:58,988 --> 00:09:00,233
Have you met Miss Stevens?

117
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,323
I introduced myself, Miss Lanier.
─ Fine.

118
00:09:03,266 --> 00:09:05,193
And may I bid you my
own personal welcome.

119
00:09:05,643 --> 00:09:07,087
We are very glad to see you.

120
00:09:07,187 --> 00:09:08,945
Well, that's very nice
of you. Thank you.

121
00:09:09,045 --> 00:09:10,833
Now if you'll just come
with me, Mr Staples.

122
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:14,987
Miss Stevens.

123
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:16,749
Marketing and Sales are below here.

124
00:09:17,078 --> 00:09:19,177
We have our own research
department on the 40th floor.

125
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:20,992
Perhaps you'd like to see that later?

126
00:09:21,196 --> 00:09:22,843
This is the Executive Corridor.

127
00:09:24,503 --> 00:09:26,428
Mr Ramsey's office is that
one down at the end.

128
00:09:26,763 --> 00:09:28,733
Then Mr Jameson, head of purchasing.

129
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,734
Mr Briggs. You'll be working
closely with Mr Briggs.

130
00:09:31,944 --> 00:09:34,041
Mr Vandeventer, Chief Engineer.

131
00:09:34,314 --> 00:09:35,559
And this is <i>your</i> office.

132
00:09:45,775 --> 00:09:46,676
Isn't it nice?

133
00:09:47,995 --> 00:09:49,039
I hope you like it.

134
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:53,726
Mr Ramsey was told by your office that
you're especially fond of this period.

135
00:09:54,977 --> 00:09:58,287
Wasn't your office in Mansfield
furnished in early American?

136
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:01,069
My furniture consisted
of two filing cabinets ..

137
00:10:01,169 --> 00:10:04,043
And a surplus metal desk
off of a destroyer escort.

138
00:10:06,675 --> 00:10:07,924
No, it's ..

139
00:10:08,337 --> 00:10:10,475
It's really very attractive. Very.

140
00:10:11,033 --> 00:10:12,676
I appreciate it very much indeed.

141
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,639
Excuse me, Miss Lanier.
Ann said you wanted to see me.

142
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:19,245
Oh yes, Marge.
Mr Staples, this is Miss Fleming.

143
00:10:19,345 --> 00:10:20,799
How do you do.
─ How do you do.

144
00:10:20,899 --> 00:10:24,170
Marge, see that Mr Staples has all he
needs in the way of office equipment.

145
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:28,133
It was arranged for this morning
at Mr Briggs' suggestion.

146
00:10:28,505 --> 00:10:31,159
I must rush now, Mr Staples.
Again, a most cordial welcome.

147
00:10:31,354 --> 00:10:32,429
Thank you very much.

148
00:10:32,628 --> 00:10:35,809
And Marge, will you stop by at my
desk when you've finished here please?

149
00:10:35,972 --> 00:10:36,958
Yes, Miss Lanier.

150
00:10:42,131 --> 00:10:44,906
I think I'd better explain the
phone system, Mr Staples.

151
00:10:45,497 --> 00:10:46,600
There are four lines.

152
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:49,036
One, is your private
line direct to outside.

153
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,972
Two is for conference calls.

154
00:10:51,225 --> 00:10:52,469
Three is for inter-office.

155
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:55,388
And Four, this button,
is for your secretary.

156
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,008
Oh I'm sorry. May I?
─ Oh. Yes, thank you.

157
00:11:00,782 --> 00:11:02,077
Yes, I think I have that.

158
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:03,721
Let me see.

159
00:11:04,668 --> 00:11:05,870
Outside, inter-office ..

160
00:11:07,116 --> 00:11:08,103
Conference and ..

161
00:11:09,158 --> 00:11:10,061
Yes, that's ..

162
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:11,403
That's fine.

163
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:16,952
Thank heavens this isn't early American.

164
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:21,623
Busy?

165
00:11:22,061 --> 00:11:23,550
No .. not at all.

166
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:26,357
Well, you must be ..?
─ Bill Briggs, your next-door neighbor.

167
00:11:26,692 --> 00:11:29,169
Yes, of course. Well I'm
certainly glad to meet you, sir.

168
00:11:29,475 --> 00:11:32,794
I think Mr Ramsey told me
you'd been sick, didn't he?

169
00:11:33,087 --> 00:11:33,902
Oh, did he?

170
00:11:34,248 --> 00:11:37,747
Actually, it's just a .. just a pesky
stomach that's been acting up on me.

171
00:11:38,178 --> 00:11:39,509
You just in from Mansfield?

172
00:11:39,609 --> 00:11:42,643
Yes, they took a house for us.
Oh, sit down, Mr Briggs.

173
00:11:42,934 --> 00:11:44,988
Settled already? Good.

174
00:11:45,852 --> 00:11:48,207
I'm not trying to set myself
up as a real New Yorker.

175
00:11:48,528 --> 00:11:50,535
Altoona, Pennsylvania.
That's where I came from.

176
00:11:51,257 --> 00:11:53,195
My first trip home, I was wearing spats.

177
00:11:53,892 --> 00:11:55,883
I remember my father not
being able to get over it.

178
00:11:56,184 --> 00:11:57,115
He says "<i>Bill</i>".

179
00:11:57,445 --> 00:11:58,433
"<i>Bill</i>" he says ..

180
00:11:58,711 --> 00:12:02,112
"<i>You went to New York to see the sights,
and instead you've became one of them</i>."

181
00:12:05,135 --> 00:12:06,853
We just got here Friday afternoon.

182
00:12:06,953 --> 00:12:09,495
So this morning, Nancy
insisted .. my wife.

183
00:12:09,948 --> 00:12:12,385
Insisted on driving me to
work on the first morning.

184
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,767
Well, you know the way women are.

185
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,944
You know, you come out
of a .. small-town plant.

186
00:12:20,693 --> 00:12:22,496
You feel a little lost
in a place like this.

187
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:26,374
Well, as I was saying, you know. We
walked into a house Friday afternoon.

188
00:12:26,565 --> 00:12:28,734
And we'd never laid eyes on
the place before, you know.

189
00:12:29,219 --> 00:12:31,059
And there it was furnished
like a magazine.

190
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:33,271
Milk in the icebox,
bourbon on the shelf.

191
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:37,505
I don't know. You got to hand it to 'em
the way they do things round here.

192
00:12:37,703 --> 00:12:40,344
Yes, Miss Lanier handles
all that. Does a fine job.

193
00:12:41,644 --> 00:12:44,348
That feeling that I got driving
into town this morning.

194
00:12:46,142 --> 00:12:48,106
I got to admit it's just ..

195
00:12:49,098 --> 00:12:50,747
It's just a little overwhelming.

196
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:55,452
Yes. And it's a pretty wonderful
thing to be as young as you are.

197
00:12:56,027 --> 00:12:58,500
And see it all spread out
in front of you like a ..

198
00:12:59,522 --> 00:13:00,794
Like a Christmas tree.

199
00:13:02,043 --> 00:13:04,452
You know .. you think of ..

200
00:13:05,395 --> 00:13:07,669
You think of big business.
You always think of it as being ..

201
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,375
Very impersonal .. you know ..?

202
00:13:11,967 --> 00:13:12,639
But ..

203
00:13:13,825 --> 00:13:15,618
It's really not true
with your Mr Ramsey.

204
00:13:17,389 --> 00:13:18,490
I know what you mean.

205
00:13:21,351 --> 00:13:23,080
How much time did you put in Mansfield?

206
00:13:23,477 --> 00:13:24,463
Almost six years.

207
00:13:24,661 --> 00:13:28,423
You must have blown a bugle in Ramsey's
ear in Ohio. He got you here in a hurry.

208
00:13:29,704 --> 00:13:33,266
Well actually, I wasn't at all sure I
wanted to come to New York, but ..

209
00:13:34,729 --> 00:13:37,286
This Ramsey is a pretty dynamic man.

210
00:13:37,632 --> 00:13:38,848
Yes .. I know.

211
00:13:40,472 --> 00:13:42,944
You see, you've been with the
firm some time now, haven't you?

212
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:46,010
Oh, maybe forty years or so.

213
00:13:47,771 --> 00:13:50,960
I seem to recall Mr Ramsey talking
about you as a production man.

214
00:13:51,768 --> 00:13:53,232
You're an engineer, aren't you?

215
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:55,034
Yes, but ..

216
00:13:55,618 --> 00:13:58,237
From what he told me, I guess I'll
be a little of everything around here.

217
00:13:58,558 --> 00:14:00,452
Mostly, in industrial relations.

218
00:14:02,738 --> 00:14:03,840
Industrial relations?

219
00:14:05,858 --> 00:14:08,094
As a matter of fact, it's
been one of my specialities.

220
00:14:09,527 --> 00:14:10,170
We ..

221
00:14:11,108 --> 00:14:13,156
We ought to get along
pretty well together.

222
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,906
I'm sure we will.

223
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:17,662
Excuse me.

224
00:14:18,032 --> 00:14:20,424
Mr Ramsey has called a meeting in
the conference room, Mr Briggs.

225
00:14:21,002 --> 00:14:21,588
Oh?

226
00:14:22,301 --> 00:14:24,592
Well Fred, it's been a real
pleasure meeting you.

227
00:14:24,813 --> 00:14:25,602
Thank you.

228
00:14:25,702 --> 00:14:27,378
Mr Ramsey is expecting Mr Staples, too.

229
00:14:28,751 --> 00:14:29,339
Oh.

230
00:14:30,868 --> 00:14:33,489
Well then, I'll .. I'll go in
with you if you don't mind?

231
00:14:34,134 --> 00:14:34,949
Not at all.

232
00:14:37,455 --> 00:14:39,814
I just hope Mr Ramsey
remembers hiring me.

233
00:14:41,054 --> 00:14:43,137
Mr Ramsey rarely forgets anything.

234
00:14:43,992 --> 00:14:45,312
After you.
─ Thank you.

235
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:47,934
Staples?
─ Yes.           ─ Hello.

236
00:14:48,192 --> 00:14:50,283
Fred, this is Harvey Jameson,
head of purchasing.

237
00:14:50,383 --> 00:14:51,501
Hello. How are you?

238
00:14:51,675 --> 00:14:52,976
So they finally finished it.

239
00:14:53,271 --> 00:14:53,919
What?

240
00:14:54,225 --> 00:14:56,911
Fred, your office. On Friday the
painters were here. It was a madhouse.

241
00:14:57,269 --> 00:14:59,442
Hey Bill, are you taking
along Ramsey's breakdown?

242
00:14:59,729 --> 00:15:02,772
No. I forgot that. A couple
of other things I forgot, too.

243
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:05,670
Jamie, you and Fred go in together.
I'll be a few minutes.          ─ Fine.

244
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:07,660
I suppose Lanier has
given you the Cook's tour?

245
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,734
What? Oh yes.

246
00:15:08,834 --> 00:15:10,488
Did she show you the conference room?

247
00:15:10,588 --> 00:15:12,216
Oh yes, on the other side. Yes.

248
00:15:13,171 --> 00:15:13,958
Mr Briggs.

249
00:15:14,978 --> 00:15:15,997
What is it, Marge?

250
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:19,522
I don't know.

251
00:15:21,878 --> 00:15:23,549
Mr Briggs, I think I ought to resign.

252
00:15:24,045 --> 00:15:25,881
Resign? What are you talking about?

253
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:27,924
What happened? What is it, Marge?

254
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:32,031
Mr Briggs, I've just been ordered to go
over to Mr Staples as his new secretary.

255
00:15:32,444 --> 00:15:34,572
Temporarily.
─ No, I don't think so.

256
00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:36,995
Who gave this order?
─ Miss Lanier.

257
00:15:37,295 --> 00:15:39,177
When?
─ About five minutes ago.

258
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:41,887
You are supposed to
break in your new secretary.

259
00:15:42,463 --> 00:15:45,522
They've picked a new secretary for me?
─ Yes, I think so.

260
00:15:47,025 --> 00:15:50,357
Out of the question for you to resign,
Marge. To even think of resigning.

261
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:53,635
You're a fine, wonderful
woman, and a great secretary.

262
00:15:54,357 --> 00:15:56,316
That's the reason they want
you over with Staples.

263
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:59,658
He'll need someone like you as he's new.
They want him to get into harness fast.

264
00:16:00,712 --> 00:16:03,005
Who can tell, Marge?
One of these days ..

265
00:16:03,598 --> 00:16:06,171
That .. stomach of mine
is a pretty perverse organ.

266
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,320
And .. I'm tired.

267
00:16:09,045 --> 00:16:11,331
You know, as it must to all men.

268
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,086
Mr Briggs.

269
00:16:14,054 --> 00:16:15,957
Have you any idea who your successor is?

270
00:16:17,828 --> 00:16:19,606
Yes. They've chose Sylvia Trammel.

271
00:16:20,219 --> 00:16:21,509
Miss Trammel?
─ Hmm.

272
00:16:21,709 --> 00:16:23,198
It is so ordained. So be it.

273
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,033
She's new, but she supposed
to be very good at dictation.

274
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,240
Well, we'll give her
a chance to prove it.

275
00:16:30,007 --> 00:16:30,793
Mr Briggs.

276
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,157
If I could only tell you what
this job has meant to me.

277
00:16:36,023 --> 00:16:38,157
What working with you has meant to me ..

278
00:16:39,157 --> 00:16:40,029
Alright, kid.

279
00:16:40,746 --> 00:16:42,886
Wash up, get your money
and get out of here.

280
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:48,292
And give Mr Staples all the
best you've got in you.

281
00:16:48,513 --> 00:16:50,536
I know you will. That's the
only way you operate.

282
00:16:51,292 --> 00:16:52,260
I like they guy.

283
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:55,531
I have a feeling he's going to
carve out a career around here.

284
00:16:56,534 --> 00:16:57,292
Yes, sir.

285
00:16:58,006 --> 00:16:59,308
Everybody seems to think so.

286
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:05,289
Sorry to keep you waiting, gentlemen.
Mr Ramsey will be with us in a moment.

287
00:17:29,842 --> 00:17:31,987
Been away, have you?
─ Good to see you.

288
00:17:32,087 --> 00:17:33,974
Sorry, Fred. I was held
up for a few minutes.

289
00:17:34,074 --> 00:17:35,170
See you later, Fred.

290
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,657
Where are we going to sit you?

291
00:17:36,757 --> 00:17:39,225
Oh, here's an empty chair.
I guess you can sit right here.

292
00:17:39,406 --> 00:17:42,380
Mr Staples, will you sit over there,
please? Right next to Mr Vandeventer.

293
00:17:42,699 --> 00:17:43,901
One down from Mr Ramsey.

294
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:50,109
Welcome back, Bill. Feeling better?

295
00:17:50,341 --> 00:17:52,189
Much, thank you. A little stomach upset.

296
00:17:52,452 --> 00:17:54,069
Good .. I'm glad it's cleared up.

297
00:17:56,402 --> 00:17:58,885
John, don't forget that contract.
Can we get it through tomorrow?

298
00:18:02,436 --> 00:18:05,301
First gentlemen, I'd like you to look
over the mimeo'd sheet on top.

299
00:18:06,316 --> 00:18:09,870
Haverford Mutual had some doctors look
into the matter of executive diets.

300
00:18:11,183 --> 00:18:13,140
Their findings showed
incredible deficiencies.

301
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:16,922
They've gotten up some food
tables. I'll have them mimeo'd

302
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:18,775
I'd like you to look them over.

303
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:23,518
As you know, it's been my feeling that
a healthy executive is an efficient one.

304
00:18:26,574 --> 00:18:29,957
I think it not amiss now to introduce
the newest member of our team.

305
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:32,425
Mr Fred Staples.
He's from Mansfield, Ohio.

306
00:18:33,214 --> 00:18:36,982
As you know, he was General Manager of
Queen Tool & Die until we took it over.

307
00:18:37,546 --> 00:18:39,136
His record there was a brilliant one.

308
00:18:39,414 --> 00:18:41,057
He's a production engineer by training.

309
00:18:41,222 --> 00:18:43,113
And an industrial
relations man by instinct.

310
00:18:44,019 --> 00:18:45,377
I expect good things from him.

311
00:18:52,003 --> 00:18:53,954
You've probably met everyone, but ..

312
00:18:54,241 --> 00:18:56,156
Just for the record,
reading from left to right.

313
00:18:56,441 --> 00:18:58,400
Mr Jameson, Head of Purchasing.
─ Yeah, we've met.

314
00:18:58,609 --> 00:18:59,824
Mr Grannigan, Controller.

315
00:19:00,674 --> 00:19:01,889
Mr Gordon, Head of Sales.

316
00:19:02,653 --> 00:19:03,926
Mr Latham, Head of Service.

317
00:19:04,174 --> 00:19:05,848
Mr Portier, Chief of Operations.

318
00:19:05,948 --> 00:19:07,626
How do you do, sir.
─ Nice to know you.

319
00:19:07,726 --> 00:19:09,674
And Mr Vandeventer, Chief Engineer.

320
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,861
How are you? Nice to see you.
─ Pleasure.

321
00:19:12,642 --> 00:19:14,620
Oh, and of course you've met Mr Briggs.

322
00:19:15,341 --> 00:19:16,069
Oh yes.

323
00:19:16,169 --> 00:19:18,257
He's our Vice President and
Assistant General manager.

324
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:20,991
In charge of everything that everybody
else forgets to be in charge of.

325
00:19:23,407 --> 00:19:25,509
Now gentlemen, you
all have before you a ..

326
00:19:25,723 --> 00:19:28,444
Copy of the Williamston
Plant purchase prospectus.

327
00:19:28,682 --> 00:19:30,589
Mr Jameson, did you attach a supplement?

328
00:19:30,783 --> 00:19:34,444
It's right there, Mr Ramsey.
Page 17r, under "Process Equipment".

329
00:19:34,865 --> 00:19:38,561
Mr Grannigan, the stock purchase plan
I outlined. I have your comments here?

330
00:19:38,785 --> 00:19:39,916
You do, Mr Ramsey.

331
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,489
Feasible, is it?
─ Very much so, in my opinion.

332
00:19:44,659 --> 00:19:45,303
Good.

333
00:19:46,431 --> 00:19:47,076
Well.

334
00:19:47,637 --> 00:19:50,855
That about winds it up, unless there
are any .. further points to be made.

335
00:19:50,955 --> 00:19:53,980
I do think, Mr Ramsey, if we could keep
the transaction under wraps for a bit.

336
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,559
At least during the preliminaries.

337
00:19:55,659 --> 00:19:59,243
You know what happens to the stock quote
if it leaks that we agreed the purchase.

338
00:19:59,691 --> 00:20:00,935
I've arranged it this way.

339
00:20:01,647 --> 00:20:03,629
The stock quotation as
of yesterday morning.

340
00:20:07,856 --> 00:20:11,814
You seem to be straining at the
leash, Mr Briggs. Or am I mistaken?

341
00:20:12,152 --> 00:20:14,795
You mention here that probable time of
purchase will be some time in June.

342
00:20:14,895 --> 00:20:16,939
Now, the plant is to be in
receivership until then?

343
00:20:17,404 --> 00:20:18,806
That seems to be what it says.

344
00:20:18,906 --> 00:20:21,206
That means six months with improper
maintenance of equipment.

345
00:20:21,306 --> 00:20:22,436
Oh, I doubt it, Bill.

346
00:20:22,932 --> 00:20:25,206
I've had two of my best men
out there for the last six weeks.

347
00:20:25,656 --> 00:20:28,178
We had a varying voltage problem,
but that was taken care of.

348
00:20:28,858 --> 00:20:32,185
No, maintenance-wise, I doubt if there
will be $1,000 worth of deterioration.

349
00:20:32,433 --> 00:20:34,112
How about goodwill?
─ What about it?

350
00:20:34,738 --> 00:20:37,559
The plant employs 900 men. That's
half the working force of the village.

351
00:20:38,219 --> 00:20:38,795
So?

352
00:20:38,895 --> 00:20:40,047
What do we do with the men?

353
00:20:40,147 --> 00:20:43,596
Cover them in Cosmoline and put them
in a drawer until we resume production?

354
00:20:43,885 --> 00:20:45,589
I thought your concern
was for the plant.

355
00:20:45,689 --> 00:20:47,259
What good is the plant without men?

356
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:50,316
You chop a village payroll in half for
six months and you may not have a plant.

357
00:20:50,512 --> 00:20:52,070
Because you might not have a village.

358
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:54,833
Mr Briggs, if we may be permitted
to disregard for the moment ..

359
00:20:54,933 --> 00:20:56,721
The considerations that
you have brought up.

360
00:20:57,307 --> 00:20:58,723
What about the rest of the plan?

361
00:20:59,413 --> 00:21:00,600
I'd say it was adequate.

362
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:02,428
Adequate?

363
00:21:04,816 --> 00:21:06,747
That gentlemen, is the
kiss of death. Believe me.

364
00:21:07,665 --> 00:21:09,376
I've known Mr Briggs for a long time.

365
00:21:09,928 --> 00:21:13,419
When he says something is adequate, what
he means is, it is entirely <i>inadequate</i>.

366
00:21:13,693 --> 00:21:17,579
I must admit to feeling concern over 900
men suddenly deprived of a livelihood.

367
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,282
Mr Briggs, do me the goodness ..

368
00:21:19,382 --> 00:21:22,251
To look at what I consider to be a
fairly elementary business principle.

369
00:21:22,897 --> 00:21:24,996
By putting 900 men out
of work temporarily.

370
00:21:25,161 --> 00:21:27,759
We may ultimately employ twice
that number in the same town.

371
00:21:28,342 --> 00:21:30,140
By cutting production costs as a result.

372
00:21:30,411 --> 00:21:32,768
We will then be able to compete
more favorably in the market.

373
00:21:33,187 --> 00:21:34,795
Thus we'll be able to sell more goods.

374
00:21:35,331 --> 00:21:37,574
We're not going to ruin that town.
We're going to make it.

375
00:21:37,674 --> 00:21:39,861
I should think Mr Briggs,
that after thirty years ..

376
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,403
You'd be able to think beyond
the tongue-clucking stage ..

377
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:45,144
And come up with something
resembling an analytical point of view.

378
00:21:45,244 --> 00:21:47,297
I'm under the impression
I gave you a point of view.

379
00:21:47,397 --> 00:21:48,315
I saw none!

380
00:21:48,828 --> 00:21:51,247
I've perceived what amounts
to a rather emotional little titbit.

381
00:21:51,502 --> 00:21:53,582
That was decidedly more
charitable than coöperative.

382
00:21:53,774 --> 00:21:55,261
And by no means thought through.

383
00:21:55,361 --> 00:21:57,990
I asked I believe, for an objective
view of a business venture.

384
00:21:58,403 --> 00:22:00,665
From you I got and I seem to
be constantly to be getting ..

385
00:22:00,885 --> 00:22:02,663
A very negative response, if any at all.

386
00:22:03,045 --> 00:22:04,432
"Adequate", I believe you said.

387
00:22:04,739 --> 00:22:08,026
Well, Mr Briggs. This move will save us
conservatively half a million dollars.

388
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:10,236
Which we'll be able to
put back into the business.

389
00:22:10,427 --> 00:22:12,620
I must say you take a
liberal view of adequacy.

390
00:22:12,806 --> 00:22:14,868
I didn't intend to make a
central issue out of this.

391
00:22:14,968 --> 00:22:17,267
But I did feel it important
enough to air in this meeting.

392
00:22:21,789 --> 00:22:23,437
Well, you have aired it in this meeting.

393
00:22:23,862 --> 00:22:25,453
And I think it's a good thing you did.

394
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,474
But I think Bill, we're pretty
much of one mind about it now.

395
00:22:29,108 --> 00:22:31,258
And we may assume the
matter is closed now?

396
00:22:32,737 --> 00:22:33,558
Mr Briggs?

397
00:22:42,589 --> 00:22:44,007
How about you, Mr Staples?

398
00:22:44,501 --> 00:22:45,661
Do you have an opinion?

399
00:22:46,564 --> 00:22:49,093
No .. no, I think not, Mr Ramsey.

400
00:22:49,723 --> 00:22:50,481
Why not?

401
00:22:51,864 --> 00:22:54,050
Well frankly, it's a little out
of my grasp at the moment.

402
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:56,178
I don't know anything
about the firm, its ..

403
00:22:56,614 --> 00:22:58,920
Corporate set up.
Its reasons for bankruptcy.

404
00:22:59,808 --> 00:23:01,224
Or for that matter, its product.

405
00:23:01,832 --> 00:23:03,192
I'm afraid I'll have to pass.

406
00:23:04,937 --> 00:23:05,780
Good answer.

407
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:09,595
I respect thoughtful
judgement, Mr Staples.

408
00:23:10,904 --> 00:23:11,862
Congratulations.

409
00:23:15,661 --> 00:23:17,146
We'll adjourn now until 2 o'clock.

410
00:23:18,755 --> 00:23:20,822
I'm sorry we got started
so late this morning.

411
00:23:20,922 --> 00:23:23,415
But I wanted this analysis
mimeo'd for your inspection.

412
00:23:24,635 --> 00:23:27,508
After lunch, we'll take up the Portland
report which you have before you.

413
00:23:28,424 --> 00:23:31,150
Mr Grannigan attended the stockholder's
meeting there on Tuesday.

414
00:23:31,366 --> 00:23:33,289
And we'll begin our
discussion with his report.

415
00:23:34,608 --> 00:23:36,403
That's all.
─ Alright, sir.

416
00:23:38,337 --> 00:23:39,198
Oh, Bill.

417
00:23:40,196 --> 00:23:42,535
What about coming to have some lunch?
─ No, thank you.

418
00:23:45,952 --> 00:23:49,126
Oh Bill, wasn't there something you
wanted to speak to me about before?

419
00:23:49,589 --> 00:23:51,234
Nothing important.
─ Fine.

420
00:23:51,906 --> 00:23:54,421
Your tummy is alright, eh?
─ Cast iron. Couldn't be better.

421
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:55,742
Good. Keep it up.

422
00:23:57,767 --> 00:23:58,825
Oh, Staples.

423
00:23:59,864 --> 00:24:01,143
See you later.
─ You bet.

424
00:24:02,818 --> 00:24:04,711
Good to have you with us, Staples.
─ Thank you.

425
00:24:04,811 --> 00:24:06,198
The arrangements satisfactory?

426
00:24:06,298 --> 00:24:09,471
Yes, just perfect. I'm sure you'll hear
from my wife very soon about that.

427
00:24:09,711 --> 00:24:10,872
It's a beautiful house.

428
00:24:10,972 --> 00:24:13,133
It's beautiful country up there.
I'm sure you'll love it.

429
00:24:13,636 --> 00:24:14,297
Oh ..

430
00:24:15,112 --> 00:24:16,184
See you later, Bill?

431
00:24:18,217 --> 00:24:18,946
Oh Fred.

432
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:23,448
Briggs is working on a project now.
A comprehensive planning report.

433
00:24:23,776 --> 00:24:25,521
The point is that it's very important.

434
00:24:25,806 --> 00:24:27,800
Most important indeed
for our future program.

435
00:24:28,292 --> 00:24:29,908
And it is <i>far</i> too big a job for Briggs.

436
00:24:30,382 --> 00:24:31,715
Or for any one man to handle.

437
00:24:32,391 --> 00:24:34,301
Now what I want you to
do is get your finger in.

438
00:24:34,566 --> 00:24:35,355
Certainly.

439
00:24:35,564 --> 00:24:37,635
What I mean is .. <i>more</i>
than just your finger in.

440
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:38,949
You understand?

441
00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:41,240
Yes, Mr Ramsey. You
make that quite clear.

442
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:56,288
Oh, could I see you a
minute, Miss Fleming.

443
00:25:15,331 --> 00:25:16,089
Yes, sir?

444
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:20,922
Oh, I wonder if you can check for me,
please, as to who's to be my secretary.

445
00:25:21,485 --> 00:25:22,992
I need some notes typed up.

446
00:25:24,103 --> 00:25:25,740
I'm to be your secretary, Mr Staples.

447
00:25:29,153 --> 00:25:30,480
But I thought Mr Briggs ..

448
00:25:31,003 --> 00:25:32,079
It was arranged for.

449
00:25:32,306 --> 00:25:33,915
Just before the meeting, Mr Staples.

450
00:25:36,413 --> 00:25:38,764
I take it you would rather
remain with Mr Briggs?

451
00:25:39,217 --> 00:25:41,621
I was Mr Briggs' secretary
for seven years, Mr Staples.

452
00:25:41,976 --> 00:25:45,406
Well in that case I see no reason why
I shouldn't be able to get someone else.

453
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:49,123
It was Mr Ramsey's idea.

454
00:25:50,305 --> 00:25:51,983
Do you want to give me those notes now?

455
00:25:55,685 --> 00:25:59,085
No .. why don't you have
your lunch first, Miss Fleming.

456
00:25:59,185 --> 00:26:01,096
We'll take care of these
when you come back.

457
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:15,646
Mr Briggs.

458
00:26:19,699 --> 00:26:21,144
There are some notes here that ..

459
00:26:21,797 --> 00:26:22,669
Later, Marge.

460
00:26:23,675 --> 00:26:24,749
I'll do it later.

461
00:27:05,126 --> 00:27:07,658
Darling, you didn't say anything about
my new hairdo. Do you like it?

462
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:08,874
Yeah, it's lovely.

463
00:27:13,326 --> 00:27:15,913
I wish you could see the new dresses
I bought. They're just beautiful.

464
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:17,691
Where are they?

465
00:27:17,791 --> 00:27:20,629
Oh, they're still at the store
having little things done to them.

466
00:27:20,893 --> 00:27:22,582
Come to the kitchen, I'll make a drink.

467
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:23,795
Not the kitchen.

468
00:27:24,592 --> 00:27:25,597
The library.

469
00:27:27,603 --> 00:27:28,245
Oh.

470
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:37,933
I hoped they'd have the dresses ready.

471
00:27:38,033 --> 00:27:40,107
I'd have them sent over to
your office this afternoon.

472
00:27:40,573 --> 00:27:42,669
I spoke to your secretary
about it when I called.

473
00:27:43,859 --> 00:27:45,332
It's funny. She didn't mention it.

474
00:27:45,702 --> 00:27:47,498
They didn't get the job done in time.

475
00:27:48,226 --> 00:27:49,871
She had a nice voice. What's she like?

476
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:51,770
Who?

477
00:27:52,346 --> 00:27:53,439
Your secretary.

478
00:27:54,238 --> 00:27:54,881
Oh ..

479
00:27:55,889 --> 00:27:57,018
What you might expect.

480
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,512
You know.

481
00:28:00,605 --> 00:28:01,737
What's her name?

482
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:05,101
Now to tell you the truth,
I didn't get her name.

483
00:28:05,456 --> 00:28:06,598
Only her dimensions.

484
00:28:07,124 --> 00:28:08,397
Ha. Alright.

485
00:28:10,218 --> 00:28:12,014
No .. her name is "Fleming".

486
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:15,448
It so happens you don't have a
thing in the world to worry about.

487
00:28:15,548 --> 00:28:16,998
She doesn't like me worth a bit.

488
00:28:18,365 --> 00:28:18,981
Why?

489
00:28:20,472 --> 00:28:23,579
Well, I guess she prefers
working for her former boss.

490
00:28:25,482 --> 00:28:26,758
Well then, why doesn't she?

491
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:29,075
I don't know. Some kind of ..

492
00:28:30,904 --> 00:28:32,436
Strategy at the top, I guess.

493
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:35,670
Sounds funny.

494
00:28:36,596 --> 00:28:37,240
Yeah.

495
00:28:38,928 --> 00:28:42,198
Her ex-boss happens to be only
one of the Vice Presidents ..

496
00:28:44,165 --> 00:28:46,555
My superior, and a
very nice guy to boot.

497
00:28:47,576 --> 00:28:49,944
Could that perhaps be a good sign?

498
00:28:51,184 --> 00:28:53,264
You figure it out. It left
me a little up in the air.

499
00:28:55,259 --> 00:28:57,084
You know Nancy, running a ..

500
00:28:57,815 --> 00:29:00,358
Plant in Ohio is beginning
to take on all the ..

501
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,017
Aspects of a ..

502
00:29:03,305 --> 00:29:06,486
Nice simple uncomplicated gravy train.

503
00:29:08,959 --> 00:29:10,061
What happened today?

504
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:12,376
Oh, nothing really.

505
00:29:12,871 --> 00:29:13,624
Just ..

506
00:29:14,824 --> 00:29:15,985
An impression, I guess.

507
00:29:18,725 --> 00:29:19,511
Sort of ..

508
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:22,058
Queer undercurrents.

509
00:29:22,751 --> 00:29:23,509
Tensions.

510
00:29:28,092 --> 00:29:28,878
Good luck.

511
00:29:56,187 --> 00:29:56,978
Mr Ramsey.

512
00:29:58,196 --> 00:30:00,100
Good morning, Mr Ramsey.
─ Miss Stevens.

513
00:30:04,272 --> 00:30:05,344
Fine. Thanks, Jerry.

514
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,268
Let me see that breakdown again.
─ Oh, sure.

515
00:30:08,694 --> 00:30:10,486
Miss Fleming, will you
step in for a minute?

516
00:30:10,586 --> 00:30:11,645
Yes, Mr Staples.

517
00:30:15,424 --> 00:30:17,012
No, that's not the one.
─ I'm sorry.

518
00:30:17,112 --> 00:30:18,150
I'll see to this.

519
00:30:19,036 --> 00:30:20,514
Here it is. Yeah.

520
00:30:20,857 --> 00:30:23,788
This is the only one I've cross indexed
for division, so don't let him keep it.

521
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:26,712
I want Billy to take my letter
from Henry Jacobsen with him.

522
00:30:27,087 --> 00:30:27,819
Oh. Yes.

523
00:30:28,266 --> 00:30:29,267
Now look, Billy.

524
00:30:30,546 --> 00:30:32,830
Henry is a nice, sincere guy, you know.

525
00:30:33,197 --> 00:30:34,542
Made out of Bessemer steel.

526
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:37,299
He hasn't been off of his duff
since he learned how to walk.

527
00:30:37,399 --> 00:30:39,861
He started out stoking coke
furnaces when he was 14.

528
00:30:40,137 --> 00:30:41,495
Mill foreman at 20 ..

529
00:30:41,595 --> 00:30:44,840
And ended up buying the whole plant
for his own 40th birthday present. So ..

530
00:30:45,275 --> 00:30:46,977
Know what I mean? Watch out.
─ Sure will.

531
00:30:47,077 --> 00:30:49,208
And give him that report and
then remember what he says.

532
00:30:49,383 --> 00:30:51,505
Make stenographic notes when
you can. When you can't ..

533
00:30:51,605 --> 00:30:53,653
Put it on paper as soon
as you get out of his office.

534
00:30:53,753 --> 00:30:54,768
No approximations.

535
00:30:55,009 --> 00:30:56,638
Make it as ..
─ Fred, I've got to go.

536
00:30:56,738 --> 00:30:57,734
I must know what they think.

537
00:30:57,834 --> 00:31:00,147
I want to know how they feel
about every paragraph they read.

538
00:31:00,402 --> 00:31:02,650
I just hope they'll open up more
to you than they did to me.

539
00:31:02,863 --> 00:31:05,024
I'll be down there sometime
next week for their decision.

540
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:07,465
Mention that to them will you.
─ Yes sir, I will.

541
00:31:08,087 --> 00:31:08,759
Hello?

542
00:31:09,364 --> 00:31:11,353
Ah .. hold it please. Just a second.

543
00:31:11,651 --> 00:31:14,027
Have a nice trip, Billy. And be
sure and call me Sunday night.

544
00:31:14,294 --> 00:31:15,998
I will. Thanks very much.
Thanks, Marge.

545
00:31:16,098 --> 00:31:18,560
Yes, put him on. Don't go
away Miss Fleming, please.

546
00:31:19,282 --> 00:31:20,004
Hello?

547
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:21,120
Judd.

548
00:31:21,407 --> 00:31:23,220
Look, sorry. I meant
to call you right back.

549
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:26,443
It's about that Atlantic States nitrate
meeting set up for October the 3rd.

550
00:31:26,604 --> 00:31:27,844
I'd like a delay on that.

551
00:31:31,284 --> 00:31:33,631
Well, I want to walk in there
sure of my ground and ..

552
00:31:33,882 --> 00:31:35,880
October is not going to
give me any ground at all.

553
00:31:39,129 --> 00:31:40,343
Yeah, could you do that?

554
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:41,860
That would be a help.

555
00:31:43,447 --> 00:31:44,330
November 7th.

556
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:46,881
Fine.

557
00:31:48,219 --> 00:31:49,826
Look, I'll see you in the dining room.

558
00:31:50,013 --> 00:31:50,828
Okay, good.

559
00:31:52,071 --> 00:31:53,492
Put that on my calendar, please.

560
00:31:53,965 --> 00:31:54,780
Now then ..

561
00:31:55,621 --> 00:31:57,580
Did you get those wires off?
─ Yes, sir.

562
00:31:57,863 --> 00:32:00,092
Right after lunch I want you
to set up a conference call ..

563
00:32:00,192 --> 00:32:02,537
With Ramsey, Jameson and myself
with Frank Derring in Denver.

564
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:05,314
You got a minute, Fred?
Sorry, Marge. This is urgent.

565
00:32:05,414 --> 00:32:07,604
It's about that NLRB vote in Portland.
─ What about it?

566
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,081
Ramsey's grumbling about it.
He thinks it's premature.

567
00:32:10,508 --> 00:32:12,456
Premature? What's he talking about?

568
00:32:12,975 --> 00:32:16,219
He's had that plant running on
wishful thinking for 19 months now.

569
00:32:16,642 --> 00:32:19,540
We've got a labor problem out there
all primed to explode in our faces.

570
00:32:20,306 --> 00:32:23,273
Look Bill, you'd better walk into his
office with a great big neon sign:

571
00:32:23,457 --> 00:32:26,417
"Strike", you know .. then tell him
I've got a little estimate worked out ..

572
00:32:26,517 --> 00:32:29,966
That it will cost us, conservatively,
$4,000 a day if that plant goes out.

573
00:32:30,182 --> 00:32:31,575
You know how it will hit him.

574
00:32:31,675 --> 00:32:33,017
You go and dig up the ground.

575
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,500
I'll follow you with a bulldozer
and we'll plow him under.

576
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:39,404
We've got 800 lumberjacks out there and
if they go it will do us big, you know.

577
00:32:39,504 --> 00:32:40,983
This won't be any one-week picket.

578
00:32:41,083 --> 00:32:43,244
This thing could go on for
a year with no strain at all.

579
00:32:43,905 --> 00:32:46,695
You walk in there, set the charge,
and I'll be in to light the fuse.

580
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:47,556
Fine.

581
00:32:47,758 --> 00:32:49,064
I'll have to call you back.

582
00:32:54,957 --> 00:32:57,595
Is 2:30 convenient for your
call to Denver, Mr Staples?

583
00:32:58,674 --> 00:32:59,792
Anything else?

584
00:32:59,892 --> 00:33:01,937
I've another problem here
if you can spare a minute.

585
00:33:02,037 --> 00:33:03,762
Oh Paul. How are you, partner?

586
00:33:04,262 --> 00:33:05,662
Mr Staples, that gun.

587
00:33:05,948 --> 00:33:08,007
Ah, you got it. You like it?
You try it out yet?

588
00:33:08,107 --> 00:33:08,956
Try it yet?

589
00:33:09,056 --> 00:33:11,922
Thirty seconds after he saw "Winchester"
on the box, he was sighting it.

590
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,098
Well, how about going out for a little
skeet shooting on Sunday? Give it try?

591
00:33:15,334 --> 00:33:16,546
Wonderful. Can I Dad?

592
00:33:17,013 --> 00:33:19,761
He's all yours, Fred. It's a
little too strenuous for me.

593
00:33:19,861 --> 00:33:21,787
Mr Staples doesn't get
tired like you do, Dad.

594
00:33:21,887 --> 00:33:23,022
I don't get tired.

595
00:33:23,658 --> 00:33:24,819
He was an All-American.

596
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:27,022
It was just terrific so I had
to stop by and thank you.

597
00:33:27,122 --> 00:33:27,932
Forget it.

598
00:33:28,032 --> 00:33:29,563
Well, so long. I'll see you outside.

599
00:33:32,961 --> 00:33:34,293
Real thoughtful of you, Fred.

600
00:33:35,071 --> 00:33:36,280
It's my pleasure, Bill.

601
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,369
Hello, Mr Ramsey.

602
00:33:37,608 --> 00:33:39,761
How are you, Paul?
Still taking your vitamins, are you?

603
00:33:40,506 --> 00:33:43,012
I guess so, sir.
─ Fine, fine. Keep it up.

604
00:33:44,315 --> 00:33:45,416
Excuse me, Mr Briggs.

605
00:33:48,095 --> 00:33:49,497
Oh man, I'm tired.

606
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:52,896
I've arranged for your call to Denver,
Mr Staples. I must go over a paragraph.

607
00:33:53,064 --> 00:33:55,947
No, I think I'll knock that off after
lunch if you don't mind, Miss Fleming.

608
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:57,282
Alright, Mr Staples.

609
00:33:59,417 --> 00:34:01,050
No. Drink it here. Relax a minute.

610
00:34:02,538 --> 00:34:03,357
Thank you.

611
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:05,612
I will.

612
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:25,300
Would you like some of mine?

613
00:34:26,443 --> 00:34:28,259
Yes, thank you.
As a matter of fact, I would.

614
00:34:32,272 --> 00:34:33,871
No, that's fine, thank you.

615
00:34:38,812 --> 00:34:40,628
Where did you play your
football, Mr Staples?

616
00:34:41,905 --> 00:34:45,238
Oh, Ohio State. But don't ask
me the years. I won't tell you.

617
00:34:45,878 --> 00:34:46,836
I won't ask you.

618
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:50,444
Anyway, I feel about three times
older than when I first came here.

619
00:34:51,662 --> 00:34:52,794
They've kept you busy?

620
00:34:53,529 --> 00:34:54,724
Yes, they sure have.

621
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:58,441
You've done very well.
You've fitted in quickly.

622
00:35:02,195 --> 00:35:03,083
Thank you.

623
00:35:06,323 --> 00:35:09,520
You know, that's the first out-and-out
<i>friendly</i> thing you've said to me.

624
00:35:10,948 --> 00:35:13,080
I think you resent me a little,
don't you, Miss Fleming?

625
00:35:13,303 --> 00:35:15,292
I don't know why you should ..
─ Well, it's just ..

626
00:35:15,605 --> 00:35:17,492
A feeling that I've
gotten from time to time.

627
00:35:20,059 --> 00:35:22,437
If you work with a man for
a long time, a fine man.

628
00:35:22,714 --> 00:35:25,075
You become part of him.
You identify yourself with him.

629
00:35:26,059 --> 00:35:27,332
Then along comes a new man.

630
00:35:28,482 --> 00:35:30,327
I like Bill Briggs. I like him a lot.

631
00:35:30,882 --> 00:35:32,011
I have from the first.

632
00:35:32,644 --> 00:35:36,231
If I have done or said anything ..
─ No, no. Of course not.

633
00:35:37,993 --> 00:35:39,695
Because I must say
you've been very fair.

634
00:35:43,303 --> 00:35:44,834
But seven years isn't a day.

635
00:35:46,246 --> 00:35:47,464
I owe a lot to Mr Briggs.

636
00:35:49,292 --> 00:35:52,106
Mr Briggs is the last of the
original bunch around here.

637
00:35:52,284 --> 00:35:54,072
The people who really
started this business.

638
00:35:54,272 --> 00:35:56,376
And it's not easy to be the
last of the original bunch.

639
00:35:58,121 --> 00:35:58,855
I know.

640
00:35:59,747 --> 00:36:01,508
He's not well. He has a bad heart.

641
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:03,306
And an ulcer.

642
00:36:05,627 --> 00:36:08,216
I guess that's just about par for
the executive course, isn't it.

643
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,896
Well, I guess I've always
been a field man.

644
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:14,050
I haven't been an executive long
enough to find that out for myself.

645
00:36:14,821 --> 00:36:15,838
You're a good one.

646
00:36:16,278 --> 00:36:17,839
I think you're a very good executive.

647
00:36:19,423 --> 00:36:20,625
You admit mistakes.

648
00:36:21,186 --> 00:36:22,373
You don't pass the buck.

649
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,286
You're a lot like Mr Briggs that way.

650
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:30,077
I take that as a very nice compliment.
─ I mean it.

651
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:34,473
Mr Briggs only trouble is that
he could never be a yes-man.

652
00:36:34,829 --> 00:36:36,187
Not even to Mr Ramsey himself.

653
00:36:38,234 --> 00:36:39,911
He always has to speak his mind.

654
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,094
You see Mr Ramsey .. doesn't
like his judgement questioned.

655
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,473
You either go along.

656
00:36:47,695 --> 00:36:48,681
Or you get off.

657
00:36:49,614 --> 00:36:50,991
Bill Briggs never got off.

658
00:36:52,219 --> 00:36:53,205
No. He never did.

659
00:36:54,934 --> 00:36:56,489
But maybe he's about to be pushed.

660
00:37:04,538 --> 00:37:07,866
They drew up in the next round and then
Howard went by him with a 60 foot putt.

661
00:37:09,092 --> 00:37:13,115
I ask you. 7 birdies and he sunk an 80
foot putt on the last hole for an eagle.

662
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:15,266
Well, hello my dear.
You know, that's some golf.

663
00:37:17,322 --> 00:37:19,125
Got everything you need?
─ Yes, indeed.

664
00:37:34,894 --> 00:37:36,825
That coffee will be ready
in just a little while.

665
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:38,015
Fine.

666
00:37:39,273 --> 00:37:40,205
You know, my ..

667
00:37:40,778 --> 00:37:42,404
My father's recipe for coffee ..

668
00:37:42,956 --> 00:37:44,990
Was to mix salt and
chocolate with the grounds.

669
00:37:46,035 --> 00:37:47,466
And cook them all up together.

670
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:50,020
He'd never drink anything else.

671
00:37:50,672 --> 00:37:51,658
Sounds wonderful.

672
00:37:52,509 --> 00:37:53,210
They ..

673
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:56,650
They serve it in a small down-town
restaurant I eat at occasionally.

674
00:37:57,973 --> 00:37:59,620
I must remember to mention it to Fred.

675
00:38:01,556 --> 00:38:03,451
You said he was a
confirmed coffee drinker?

676
00:38:04,353 --> 00:38:06,017
Dedicated.
─ Fine.

677
00:38:07,534 --> 00:38:09,441
He's quite a young man,
this husband of yours.

678
00:38:10,767 --> 00:38:12,732
Have you had a chance to
read much of the report?

679
00:38:12,989 --> 00:38:14,434
Of course it isn't finished yet.

680
00:38:14,534 --> 00:38:16,405
Thank you for letting me see this much.

681
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:20,281
Not according to the protocol,
I suppose, of a dinner party.

682
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:23,594
It makes me extremely
proud of my judgement.

683
00:38:24,784 --> 00:38:25,707
I'm so happy.

684
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,619
He's been worried about it.

685
00:38:27,908 --> 00:38:28,580
Nancy.

686
00:38:29,706 --> 00:38:30,783
Would you excuse me?

687
00:38:37,996 --> 00:38:39,272
A Wonderful party, you two.

688
00:38:39,641 --> 00:38:41,196
Makes me think I should get married.

689
00:38:41,296 --> 00:38:43,373
Don't do anything as drastic as that.

690
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,617
It's been wonderful having
you, Ed. Come again soon.

691
00:38:45,717 --> 00:38:46,962
You try keeping me away.

692
00:38:47,252 --> 00:38:49,841
I'll see you at the office tomorrow.
─ Yes. Bright and early. Goodnight.

693
00:38:50,313 --> 00:38:52,578
Ah Jamie, you don't have to
go yet. Stick around a while.

694
00:38:52,909 --> 00:38:54,851
Of course, I'd like to stay
all night, however ..

695
00:38:54,951 --> 00:38:57,306
We're going home. I can't
get him out of here, Nancy.

696
00:38:57,538 --> 00:39:00,352
At these office parties,
eating all the canapés is bad.

697
00:39:00,732 --> 00:39:02,498
I thought everybody behaved very well.

698
00:39:02,598 --> 00:39:03,514
Is that so?

699
00:39:03,614 --> 00:39:05,363
I give you credit for that.
─ Night, again.

700
00:39:05,463 --> 00:39:07,183
I was beginning to like all of them.

701
00:39:07,283 --> 00:39:09,159
Will you come over and see us?
─ Certainly.

702
00:39:09,259 --> 00:39:10,574
During the day?
─ Love to.

703
00:39:10,674 --> 00:39:12,745
You know, holidays.
Jamie never gets home at all.

704
00:39:12,845 --> 00:39:15,333
I think we wives ought to form a union.
─ You're right.

705
00:39:15,498 --> 00:39:17,343
Goodnight, dear.
─ Bye bye.       ─ Goodnight.

706
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:26,178
I wonder what happened
to Bill Briggs tonight.

707
00:39:26,624 --> 00:39:29,407
Oh darling, I forgot to
tell you. He phoned earlier.

708
00:39:29,963 --> 00:39:32,182
He said he wanted to come
but he just didn't feel up to it.

709
00:39:32,282 --> 00:39:34,127
Oh, I wish you'd have
called me to the phone.

710
00:39:34,227 --> 00:39:36,387
I wanted to talk to him anyway.
─ Darling, you were busy.

711
00:39:36,535 --> 00:39:37,664
Well, I know, but I ..

712
00:39:39,915 --> 00:39:41,962
What about Ramsey? Is he
planning to spend the night?

713
00:39:42,681 --> 00:39:46,378
No .. he just gravitated towards the
library and made himself cozy.

714
00:39:47,873 --> 00:39:50,110
That sounds a little like
<i>artificial</i> gravitation to me.

715
00:39:50,459 --> 00:39:52,928
You didn't have anything to do
with it, of course?        ─ Well ..

716
00:39:53,987 --> 00:39:55,729
He's really an amazing person.

717
00:39:56,278 --> 00:39:59,026
You know, I expected
a real tycoon, but ..

718
00:39:59,484 --> 00:40:01,354
He's so simple. Almost childlike.

719
00:40:02,207 --> 00:40:05,494
Baby, I just hope by mistake
you never wander into a jungle.

720
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:10,153
Goodnight, Jeff.
─ Goodnight. Wonderful time.

721
00:40:14,898 --> 00:40:16,780
The most interesting
reading matter here, Fred.

722
00:40:17,854 --> 00:40:19,120
Very interesting reading.

723
00:40:20,249 --> 00:40:23,828
I took the liberty of taking your wife's
invitation to look over your report.

724
00:40:25,234 --> 00:40:26,021
Oh really?

725
00:40:26,648 --> 00:40:27,663
Good, heady stuff.

726
00:40:28,345 --> 00:40:29,420
Good solid thinking.

727
00:40:29,882 --> 00:40:31,654
And some of it is better than good.

728
00:40:33,221 --> 00:40:35,888
Of course, I can't say that I agree
with all your conclusions, but ..

729
00:40:36,504 --> 00:40:37,638
I listen to arguments.

730
00:40:38,306 --> 00:40:40,219
It will be good to hear
arguments for a change.

731
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:42,076
<i>Good </i>arguments.

732
00:40:42,927 --> 00:40:45,997
I can't tell you what a relief that is.
We really sweated that one out.

733
00:40:46,502 --> 00:40:48,103
Fred, I like a man to show initiative.

734
00:40:49,203 --> 00:40:51,642
I like a man who's not afraid
to think a new thought.

735
00:40:51,827 --> 00:40:53,712
To take a different kind
of step on his own.

736
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:56,080
With your permission, I'll ..

737
00:40:56,449 --> 00:40:59,069
Borrow this extra copy of
your report just overnight.

738
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,435
But for now, I can say ..

739
00:41:02,075 --> 00:41:03,142
I'm very impressed.

740
00:41:04,973 --> 00:41:07,979
Of course we haven't finished it yet,
but Bill and I, after another week we ..

741
00:41:08,145 --> 00:41:08,788
Bill?

742
00:41:10,571 --> 00:41:11,530
You mean Briggs?

743
00:41:13,308 --> 00:41:15,546
Yes, sir. Well, we worked
together on this.

744
00:41:15,993 --> 00:41:17,448
Oh come now, Staples.

745
00:41:18,279 --> 00:41:20,377
I pride myself on my sense for style.

746
00:41:21,189 --> 00:41:24,762
I can link what I see with what I know
to be peculiar to a certain individual.

747
00:41:25,464 --> 00:41:26,860
And I know Bill Briggs' work.

748
00:41:27,338 --> 00:41:29,346
I've been exposed to it
since I was of voting age.

749
00:41:29,903 --> 00:41:30,606
This ..

750
00:41:31,299 --> 00:41:33,738
This isn't his style.
It isn't his brand of thinking.

751
00:41:34,813 --> 00:41:37,288
Well, I don't know what Nancy has
told you, but Bill and I worked ..

752
00:41:37,388 --> 00:41:39,096
Fred. Learn to accept success.

753
00:41:40,389 --> 00:41:42,656
It's tougher sometimes than
learning to accept failure.

754
00:41:43,726 --> 00:41:45,630
Don't take half of your
accomplishment and ..

755
00:41:45,886 --> 00:41:48,145
And hand it out gratuitously
to the man on your left.

756
00:41:48,572 --> 00:41:50,276
Who hasn't the stuff
to do it on his own.

757
00:41:50,866 --> 00:41:52,631
That is charitable. Humane.

758
00:41:53,004 --> 00:41:54,968
It makes you feel good.
But it's <i>not</i> business.

759
00:41:55,068 --> 00:41:56,804
Mr Ramsey, I'd like
to clear up one point.

760
00:41:56,904 --> 00:41:58,606
There will be a meeting
on Tuesday, Fred.

761
00:41:59,206 --> 00:42:00,593
We can discuss the report then.

762
00:42:01,356 --> 00:42:03,286
I assure you I don't
want any undue credit.

763
00:42:03,386 --> 00:42:05,131
I never extend undue credit.

764
00:42:05,676 --> 00:42:07,740
Ask anybody! Ask your friend, Briggs.

765
00:42:09,404 --> 00:42:11,017
You think I'm tough on him, don't you.

766
00:42:13,449 --> 00:42:14,465
I am tough on him.

767
00:42:18,228 --> 00:42:19,620
And I think Bill is ..

768
00:42:21,313 --> 00:42:22,500
I think he's a good man.

769
00:42:23,322 --> 00:42:24,028
He was.

770
00:42:24,824 --> 00:42:26,695
And grandfather clocks <i>were</i> good clocks.

771
00:42:26,972 --> 00:42:28,788
And Stanley Steamers
<i>were</i> good automobiles.

772
00:42:28,888 --> 00:42:30,883
But you can't run them
in competition today.

773
00:42:32,136 --> 00:42:35,045
I must say that I like some
of his ideas very much.

774
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:36,907
Very much indeed.

775
00:42:37,363 --> 00:42:38,092
So do I.

776
00:42:39,267 --> 00:42:40,142
Some of them.

777
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:41,758
Not many.

778
00:42:43,373 --> 00:42:44,446
Still, a man with ..

779
00:42:45,472 --> 00:42:46,740
Bill's experience and ..

780
00:42:48,603 --> 00:42:50,468
I don't know. I think he'd
be hard to replace.

781
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:53,176
I'll see if that coffee is ready yet.
─ Are you serious, Fred?

782
00:42:53,677 --> 00:42:55,096
Briggs would be hard to replace?

783
00:42:55,818 --> 00:42:57,093
Do you honestly think that?

784
00:42:57,767 --> 00:43:00,705
And why do you think I brought you down
here from Mansfield on short notice?

785
00:43:01,415 --> 00:43:03,786
Do you think that was a whim?
Is that what you think?

786
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:06,671
Fred, you're Briggs' replacement.

787
00:43:07,575 --> 00:43:08,933
I thought you understood that.

788
00:43:10,741 --> 00:43:11,413
I'm ..

789
00:43:12,629 --> 00:43:13,933
Expecting his resignation.

790
00:43:14,654 --> 00:43:16,742
I don't like to prolong
these things. They are ..

791
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,944
Unpleasant and personal,
no matter what tack you use.

792
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:24,370
And under no circumstances
could I, or ..

793
00:43:25,042 --> 00:43:26,432
Would I, undertake to fire him.

794
00:43:33,265 --> 00:43:36,225
Coffee is in the living room. I thought
you'd like to go in there? Quiet.

795
00:43:36,545 --> 00:43:38,388
Look at the time. I really must go.

796
00:43:39,517 --> 00:43:40,880
It's been a wonderful evening.

797
00:43:41,466 --> 00:43:42,882
Sorry you have to leave so soon.

798
00:43:43,392 --> 00:43:44,294
I really must.

799
00:43:45,604 --> 00:43:48,199
My .. coat, I think is in the bedroom.

800
00:43:48,798 --> 00:43:50,470
Oh yes of course. I will get it for you.

801
00:44:00,534 --> 00:44:01,941
May I make a suggestion?

802
00:44:03,699 --> 00:44:05,703
Mr Ramsey, I don't want
to seem ungrateful.

803
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,549
I'm not looking for gratitude.

804
00:44:08,523 --> 00:44:10,313
You can't run a business
on thank-you notes.

805
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:12,180
That's Briggs' trouble.

806
00:44:12,962 --> 00:44:15,382
And, God forgive me that
was my father's trouble, too.

807
00:44:16,411 --> 00:44:17,057
This.

808
00:44:18,446 --> 00:44:22,599
The incredible conception of an industry
being run like a soup kitchen, like a ..

809
00:44:23,185 --> 00:44:24,754
Like a welfare comfort station.

810
00:44:26,899 --> 00:44:28,642
I know what the old-timers think of me.

811
00:44:29,662 --> 00:44:31,371
I've grown up getting stared at ..

812
00:44:31,471 --> 00:44:34,345
By a lot of tongue-clucking
old fogeys who find me ruthless.

813
00:44:35,943 --> 00:44:37,501
The kind of people who represent all ..

814
00:44:37,601 --> 00:44:40,980
That might have kept our business from
growing to anything like its present size.

815
00:44:42,612 --> 00:44:47,142
This .. this stupid black and white idea
that honesty and profit are incompatible.

816
00:44:49,437 --> 00:44:50,859
I just happen to feel.

817
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:53,379
That the atmosphere
of a large corporation.

818
00:44:53,601 --> 00:44:55,746
Cannot be constantly cathedral-like.

819
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:08,259
Thank you, Mrs Staples.

820
00:45:09,285 --> 00:45:12,048
And .. again, thanks for
a wonderful evening.

821
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:20,177
I'll see you in the morning, Fred.

822
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:23,955
You didn't steal that promotion.

823
00:45:25,370 --> 00:45:26,185
You won it.

824
00:45:27,511 --> 00:45:28,412
Remember that.

825
00:45:34,757 --> 00:45:36,656
Goodnight, Mr Ramsey.
I hope you'll come again.

826
00:45:36,935 --> 00:45:39,051
Thank you Nancy, and I hope
I'll be able to. Goodnight.

827
00:45:39,293 --> 00:45:40,096
Goodnight.

828
00:45:53,275 --> 00:45:55,506
What .. what was <i>that</i> all about?

829
00:45:57,030 --> 00:45:58,674
I'm Bill Briggs' replacement.

830
00:46:00,189 --> 00:46:01,657
A Vice Presidency?

831
00:46:02,033 --> 00:46:03,682
You must have really spread it on him.

832
00:46:05,034 --> 00:46:05,741
Listen.

833
00:46:06,759 --> 00:46:08,250
A little rare roast beef and ..

834
00:46:08,588 --> 00:46:11,514
Wifely pride don't get you
that kind of a promotion.

835
00:46:11,844 --> 00:46:13,719
Yeah, it takes something a little more.

836
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:16,242
A little misrepresentation
for one thing.

837
00:46:17,383 --> 00:46:19,512
A little switch in
authorship for another.

838
00:46:19,873 --> 00:46:21,517
You told him <i>I'd</i> written that report.

839
00:46:21,617 --> 00:46:23,597
I did not! I told him
Bill had helped you.

840
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:25,739
But Nancy, this is Bill's basic idea.

841
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:29,059
They're the same set of ideas that he's
had for years. I gathered that much

842
00:46:29,379 --> 00:46:31,642
You gave it life, you made it work.
You made it practical.

843
00:46:31,742 --> 00:46:33,549
Even so Nancy, I don't
want any part of it.

844
00:46:33,649 --> 00:46:35,784
Fred, I happen to know what
you contributed to this.

845
00:46:36,378 --> 00:46:38,658
I also know that you
can't stand winning.

846
00:46:38,758 --> 00:46:40,849
If you have even a nodding
acquaintance with the loser.

847
00:46:40,949 --> 00:46:44,164
I don't like stepping on another human
being to get to a capital gains bracket.

848
00:46:44,339 --> 00:46:46,316
Ramsey stalking that
poor guy like an animal.

849
00:46:46,416 --> 00:46:48,223
He'll whip him to death if he
can, to make him resign.

850
00:46:48,323 --> 00:46:50,456
I didn't hear you tell Mr
Ramsey he was mistaken.

851
00:46:50,556 --> 00:46:52,851
I didn't hear any clear-cut
defence of Mr Briggs.

852
00:46:53,436 --> 00:46:54,937
If you don't want to be successful.

853
00:46:55,037 --> 00:46:56,653
Go tell that to Mr Ramsey.
─ Look, Nancy.

854
00:46:56,753 --> 00:46:57,786
Will you please ..

855
00:46:57,886 --> 00:46:59,922
Then you check in every
night, but don't tell me ..

856
00:47:00,022 --> 00:47:03,374
I don't want to argue about it!
─ Nor do I .. I want you to answer me.

857
00:47:04,159 --> 00:47:06,272
Did you tell him that
your wife was mistaken?

858
00:47:06,918 --> 00:47:09,650
Did you tell him that you were taking
bows for something that you did not do?

859
00:47:16,149 --> 00:47:16,841
No.

860
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:20,348
No, I didn't.

861
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:23,373
Why not, Fred?

862
00:47:25,292 --> 00:47:26,029
Why not?

863
00:47:28,313 --> 00:47:29,627
Because I wanted the job.

864
00:47:32,605 --> 00:47:33,414
Thank you.

865
00:47:34,225 --> 00:47:35,738
For a straight and honest answer.

866
00:47:37,773 --> 00:47:39,429
Now I think we can both sleep tonight.

867
00:48:11,574 --> 00:48:13,189
Hi.
─ Good morning, Paul.

868
00:48:14,758 --> 00:48:16,602
Where is Cora?
─ She's late, I guess.

869
00:48:21,832 --> 00:48:23,450
Aren't you going to be late for school?

870
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:25,094
It's only 8:10.

871
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:26,800
I've still got six minutes.

872
00:48:27,672 --> 00:48:29,693
You've got it figured out to
a science, haven't you.

873
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,735
I've just got it figured to
how far I have to go.

874
00:48:34,018 --> 00:48:35,307
And how long it'll take me.

875
00:48:35,407 --> 00:48:37,700
Well, if you've found that out,
you've found out a lot.

876
00:48:40,755 --> 00:48:41,862
Thanks for breakfast.

877
00:48:43,897 --> 00:48:45,361
You worked late again last night.

878
00:48:45,696 --> 00:48:47,555
Yeah. No rest for the weary.

879
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:51,281
You haven't got it down to a
science yet, have you dad.

880
00:48:51,784 --> 00:48:52,427
What?

881
00:48:53,473 --> 00:48:54,803
How far you have to go and ..

882
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:56,704
How long it will take you.

883
00:48:58,837 --> 00:49:00,024
What's the matter, Paul?

884
00:49:04,791 --> 00:49:06,439
Here. Here's last night's double-header.

885
00:49:06,677 --> 00:49:08,007
The one we were going to see.

886
00:49:08,382 --> 00:49:10,333
Oh, I forgot all about it, Paul. I'm ..

887
00:49:11,065 --> 00:49:11,852
I'm sorry.

888
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:14,963
We didn't miss much.
I watched it on television.

889
00:49:15,364 --> 00:49:18,297
A crummy double-header. The Braves
took both of them. You're lucky.

890
00:49:19,445 --> 00:49:21,273
The Yanks are playing
tonight, aren't they?

891
00:49:21,373 --> 00:49:22,674
Yeah. They play the Red Sox.

892
00:49:23,149 --> 00:49:24,422
Let's start all over again.

893
00:49:24,742 --> 00:49:27,548
You meet me at the office. We'll have
dinner and then go to the game together.

894
00:49:27,648 --> 00:49:29,158
Sounds good.
─ It's a date.

895
00:49:31,036 --> 00:49:31,833
You're on.

896
00:49:32,329 --> 00:49:33,963
So long, Dad. Have a good day and ..

897
00:49:35,115 --> 00:49:35,779
Uh ..

898
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:37,804
If you can't make it tonight.

899
00:49:37,998 --> 00:49:39,500
Would you give me a call at school?

900
00:49:40,427 --> 00:49:42,361
I've raised the world's worst pessimist.

901
00:49:42,461 --> 00:49:46,195
At eight in the morning you work out the
worst thing that could happen tonight.

902
00:49:47,367 --> 00:49:48,668
Upstairs in my room, I've ..

903
00:49:49,338 --> 00:49:51,759
I've got a drawer full of tickets
to ballgames we've never seen.

904
00:49:52,549 --> 00:49:53,678
Because of that stuff.

905
00:49:54,537 --> 00:49:55,210
But ..

906
00:49:55,969 --> 00:49:57,616
Call me if you can, Dad. It's important.

907
00:49:58,197 --> 00:49:59,500
I'll make it this time, son.

908
00:50:00,834 --> 00:50:02,612
Can't you have another
glass of milk and ..

909
00:50:02,712 --> 00:50:04,837
Maybe tell me about last
night's double-header?

910
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:07,270
I'll be late. I wish I could.

911
00:50:08,253 --> 00:50:09,756
So long, Dad. Take it easy.

912
00:50:10,406 --> 00:50:11,049
Sure.

913
00:50:29,937 --> 00:50:31,154
Good evening, Mr Staples.

914
00:50:31,326 --> 00:50:32,398
Good evening, Sally.

915
00:50:46,848 --> 00:50:47,606
Paul?

916
00:50:57,306 --> 00:50:58,064
Hi, Bill.

917
00:50:59,162 --> 00:50:59,966
Hi, Fred.

918
00:51:01,295 --> 00:51:02,492
I thought it was my son.

919
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:04,316
He's going to pick me up.

920
00:51:06,016 --> 00:51:07,348
You got time for a cigarette?

921
00:51:09,031 --> 00:51:09,788
Sure.

922
00:51:13,576 --> 00:51:16,250
What are you doing here? I thought
you were going to the ballgame.

923
00:51:17,144 --> 00:51:18,903
I've had a miserable
headache since dinner.

924
00:51:19,853 --> 00:51:22,430
So I sent Paul on to see the game alone.

925
00:51:22,949 --> 00:51:24,164
He's going to pick me up.

926
00:51:24,606 --> 00:51:25,907
How long have you been here?

927
00:51:26,461 --> 00:51:27,845
A couple of hours, I guess.

928
00:51:30,978 --> 00:51:33,498
Can I get you an aspirin or something?
─ No .. no.

929
00:51:33,921 --> 00:51:35,019
I'm much better now.

930
00:51:37,022 --> 00:51:37,825
Anyway.

931
00:51:38,272 --> 00:51:41,375
It gave me a chance to look over the
supplements you did for the report.

932
00:51:43,245 --> 00:51:45,021
I think Ramsey's right, Fred.

933
00:51:45,772 --> 00:51:47,995
You may be an engineer
by diploma, but you're ..

934
00:51:49,081 --> 00:51:51,896
A crackerjack industrial planner
by instinct or something.

935
00:51:52,523 --> 00:51:54,956
Coming from you Bill,
that sounds real good.

936
00:51:55,499 --> 00:51:56,600
No question about it.

937
00:51:57,142 --> 00:51:58,994
Some of your suggestions
were great, Fred.

938
00:51:59,654 --> 00:52:00,526
Really great.

939
00:52:01,041 --> 00:52:02,724
I've incorporated them verbatim.

940
00:52:05,423 --> 00:52:06,697
I like your approach, Fred.

941
00:52:07,567 --> 00:52:10,145
You think of people in
terms of the human factor.

942
00:52:10,785 --> 00:52:12,588
Not just logistically.

943
00:52:13,636 --> 00:52:16,385
Something I've never been able
to make Ramsey understand.

944
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:18,420
Anyway.

945
00:52:18,878 --> 00:52:21,972
Now he can't complain I turn
in the same report every year.

946
00:52:23,093 --> 00:52:24,776
He won't be able to say that this year.

947
00:52:28,216 --> 00:52:29,275
Join me, Fred?

948
00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:32,261
No thanks, Bill. I've got to ..

949
00:52:32,504 --> 00:52:34,359
Take Nancy out for supper and ..

950
00:52:35,035 --> 00:52:36,921
And that long drive home, you know.

951
00:52:41,085 --> 00:52:43,600
I don't know.
Maybe I'm just getting old.

952
00:52:44,925 --> 00:52:46,171
I used to be pretty tough.

953
00:52:47,197 --> 00:52:48,709
I'm still tough, I guess.

954
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:53,092
But every now and then I get .. tired.

955
00:52:56,822 --> 00:52:58,218
Tired of arguments.

956
00:52:58,436 --> 00:53:01,898
Tired of battling. Tired of the
whole bloody mess with all this ..

957
00:53:02,198 --> 00:53:04,486
Fancy organization as super-finagling.

958
00:53:04,951 --> 00:53:07,341
Oh I know it's legal and
modern and all that.

959
00:53:07,816 --> 00:53:09,435
It's what they call a "trend" isn't it?

960
00:53:09,975 --> 00:53:12,136
In the old days things
were a lot simpler.

961
00:53:13,368 --> 00:53:16,297
Businesses grow, Bill.
─ This business didn't grow.

962
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:18,612
Not since old man Ramsey passed on.

963
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:20,163
It's been added to.

964
00:53:20,770 --> 00:53:21,935
That's not growth.

965
00:53:22,322 --> 00:53:26,408
Just plain acquisition of business
and stock transfers and bank loans.

966
00:53:26,965 --> 00:53:30,223
Manipulated by hired shysters
and a sharp-shooting accountant.

967
00:53:30,966 --> 00:53:34,858
And organized and controlled by
a barracuda like Walter Ramsey.

968
00:53:36,977 --> 00:53:38,664
You sure you won't have a snifter, Fred?

969
00:53:40,037 --> 00:53:41,847
I wish you would.
─ No.

970
00:53:45,236 --> 00:53:47,728
Look, times change, Bill. You know that.

971
00:53:47,894 --> 00:53:49,667
But do they always
change for the better?

972
00:53:49,959 --> 00:53:53,749
Old Ramsey could walk down a production
line and call any man by his first name.

973
00:53:54,158 --> 00:53:56,304
And get called by his
first name in return.

974
00:53:56,572 --> 00:53:58,752
Yeah, I know that feeling, believe me.

975
00:53:59,094 --> 00:54:01,217
He didn't need public relations experts.

976
00:54:01,784 --> 00:54:03,708
Honor was enough. Character.

977
00:54:04,404 --> 00:54:06,738
And he never sold a share of
stock in this company either.

978
00:54:07,218 --> 00:54:10,637
Not until the depression came along and
then he had to raise cash or go under.

979
00:54:10,983 --> 00:54:12,059
And do you know why?

980
00:54:12,226 --> 00:54:14,996
Because he would not
lay off one single man.

981
00:54:15,692 --> 00:54:17,342
That's the kind of man Jim Ramsey was.

982
00:54:19,338 --> 00:54:23,289
Now I sit in that fancy conference
room with Jim Ramsey's son.

983
00:54:24,844 --> 00:54:27,871
I sit there and I see all
the old man's principles ..

984
00:54:28,577 --> 00:54:29,861
All his beliefs.

985
00:54:30,249 --> 00:54:32,194
Every single thing holy to him.

986
00:54:32,866 --> 00:54:35,876
Jobbed off by this spindly
little financial wizard.

987
00:54:36,634 --> 00:54:38,888
This wall-eyed,
ice-coated little rooster.

988
00:54:38,988 --> 00:54:41,394
Who knows more about debentures
than about the human heart.

989
00:54:41,494 --> 00:54:42,640
Bill.
─ I'm alright.

990
00:54:43,585 --> 00:54:45,005
Take it easy.
─ I'm alright.

991
00:54:45,841 --> 00:54:47,857
You're beginning to work yourself up.
─ I'm alright.

992
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:52,091
Sit down, Fred.

993
00:54:54,111 --> 00:54:57,840
Sit down quietly and be a nice,
sympathetic friend and associate.

994
00:54:59,532 --> 00:55:04,098
I wonder if you're as good a human being
as you are an industrial relations man.

995
00:55:08,261 --> 00:55:09,593
He doesn't like you, does he.

996
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:10,809
No.

997
00:55:13,388 --> 00:55:14,132
Bill.

998
00:55:14,815 --> 00:55:17,391
Has it ever occurred to you to resign?
─ Pah!

999
00:55:17,657 --> 00:55:20,035
Of course it has .. a thousand times.

1000
00:55:22,115 --> 00:55:23,016
Why don't you?

1001
00:55:24,117 --> 00:55:24,761
What?

1002
00:55:26,119 --> 00:55:27,029
Resign.

1003
00:55:29,509 --> 00:55:31,800
You can't take the chance
of letting this man fire you.

1004
00:55:32,728 --> 00:55:35,494
On our level you don't
get fired. You know that.

1005
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:40,392
After 30 years productive work they can't
say to a man like me "alright, get out".

1006
00:55:41,155 --> 00:55:42,466
They just can't do that.

1007
00:55:43,562 --> 00:55:44,614
So what do they do?

1008
00:55:45,882 --> 00:55:47,202
They create a situation.

1009
00:55:48,379 --> 00:55:51,581
A situation you can't work in
and finally that you can't live in.

1010
00:55:52,583 --> 00:55:54,685
With this tension .. abuse.

1011
00:55:55,857 --> 00:55:57,385
Small humiliations.

1012
00:55:58,451 --> 00:56:02,110
It all starts out on a scale
so subtle, so microscopic.

1013
00:56:03,444 --> 00:56:06,146
That at first you can't really
believe it's happening at all.

1014
00:56:08,082 --> 00:56:09,813
Gradually, the thing
begins to take shape.

1015
00:56:11,281 --> 00:56:13,230
Pieces fit together.
All the little bits.

1016
00:56:14,048 --> 00:56:15,389
And it becomes unmistakable.

1017
00:56:16,691 --> 00:56:19,450
They chip away at your
pride, your security.

1018
00:56:20,539 --> 00:56:22,991
Until you begin to have .. doubts.

1019
00:56:24,139 --> 00:56:26,089
Then .. fears.

1020
00:56:28,007 --> 00:56:28,931
Ramsey.

1021
00:56:29,990 --> 00:56:31,202
He wants me to resign.

1022
00:56:31,302 --> 00:56:34,680
He wants me to get my craw so full, I'll
be miserable enough to do just that.

1023
00:56:35,056 --> 00:56:37,101
But you'd take it?
─ Yes, I'd take it.

1024
00:56:37,523 --> 00:56:38,141
Why?

1025
00:56:38,409 --> 00:56:41,198
The bigger the job, the more desperately
you hang on to it.              ─ Why?

1026
00:56:42,261 --> 00:56:42,917
Why?

1027
00:56:43,017 --> 00:56:44,661
Why do you take it?
Why don't you quit?

1028
00:56:45,724 --> 00:56:46,404
Quit?

1029
00:56:46,504 --> 00:56:48,040
Yes, Quit. Get out of it, chuck it.

1030
00:56:48,417 --> 00:56:50,591
You'd have your pension,
your peace of mind.

1031
00:56:51,425 --> 00:56:52,014
No!

1032
00:56:52,431 --> 00:56:55,788
You know Ramsey is going to go on
hounding you until he makes you quit.

1033
00:56:56,173 --> 00:56:56,854
Never!

1034
00:56:57,938 --> 00:56:59,342
He'll <i>never </i>make me quit!

1035
00:57:04,794 --> 00:57:05,580
Bill, I ..

1036
00:57:07,012 --> 00:57:09,514
I wish I could understand
why you go on taking it.

1037
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:11,744
Because I'm weak, I guess.

1038
00:57:12,486 --> 00:57:15,466
Because I'm sixty-two years old and
I don't think I could get another job.

1039
00:57:15,990 --> 00:57:17,207
How does that strike you?

1040
00:57:17,916 --> 00:57:18,902
How do you think?

1041
00:57:21,573 --> 00:57:23,458
Once in a while I have a dream.

1042
00:57:24,643 --> 00:57:28,172
I dream I'm sitting in that conference
room and he starts working me over.

1043
00:57:29,129 --> 00:57:30,600
I'm just smiling, see.

1044
00:57:31,559 --> 00:57:33,256
I'm perfectly calm and I'm taking it.

1045
00:57:34,363 --> 00:57:36,134
I don't show the slightest resentment.

1046
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:37,688
And then.

1047
00:57:38,681 --> 00:57:42,131
And then without any change of
expression, I get up out of my chair.

1048
00:57:42,231 --> 00:57:43,508
And I walk over to him.

1049
00:57:44,188 --> 00:57:46,028
And I say .. "Ramsey".
─ Bill.

1050
00:57:46,617 --> 00:57:48,830
Ramsey!
─ Bill.           ─ Ramsey, I say!

1051
00:57:49,092 --> 00:57:51,679
And then I smash him, and then
I smash him again.     ─ Bill.

1052
00:57:51,779 --> 00:57:53,492
Get hold of yourself.
─ I hit him again!

1053
00:57:53,592 --> 00:57:55,625
And he starts to fall and I hold him up.

1054
00:57:55,725 --> 00:57:56,424
Bill!

1055
00:57:56,524 --> 00:57:58,483
Ramsey, I say: I'm not through yet!
─ Bill!

1056
00:58:00,935 --> 00:58:02,479
[ Whistling ]

1057
00:58:03,751 --> 00:58:04,623
It's the kid.

1058
00:58:05,685 --> 00:58:06,930
He's coming to pick me up.

1059
00:58:07,123 --> 00:58:09,496
Fred .. I don't want him
to see me. Not like this.

1060
00:58:09,695 --> 00:58:12,519
You're alright, Bill. Just sit down now.
─ No, he can't see me like this.

1061
00:58:13,018 --> 00:58:16,045
Fred, help me, help me.
─ Alright, I'll take care of him.

1062
00:58:16,409 --> 00:58:18,434
You just lay low for a bit.
I'll see he gets home.

1063
00:58:18,534 --> 00:58:20,856
Tell him I left early to get ..
─ Bill, be quiet .. be quiet!

1064
00:58:20,956 --> 00:58:22,372
Please Fred, hurry.
─ Be quiet.

1065
00:58:25,612 --> 00:58:28,337
[ Whistling ]

1066
00:58:29,416 --> 00:58:30,488
It's me, Paul.

1067
00:58:30,883 --> 00:58:32,357
Oh hi, Mr Staples.

1068
00:58:33,549 --> 00:58:35,793
Man, what a place by night.

1069
00:58:36,127 --> 00:58:37,570
Where do they keep the caskets?

1070
00:58:37,670 --> 00:58:38,832
How you doing, partner?

1071
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:40,698
Dad said I should drop
in and pick him up.

1072
00:58:41,306 --> 00:58:43,523
Oh. Well he went on home.
He needed a little rest.

1073
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:45,629
Oh .. good.

1074
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:47,685
He's under orders not to work late.

1075
00:58:48,494 --> 00:58:50,057
He can't seem to keep away lately.

1076
00:58:50,362 --> 00:58:52,160
Always working, always worrying.

1077
00:58:53,364 --> 00:58:54,724
No wonder he's Number 2 man.

1078
00:58:55,468 --> 00:58:57,352
Suppose I drop you off
at Grand Central, huh?

1079
00:58:57,452 --> 00:58:58,707
Swell. Thanks, Mr Staples.

1080
00:58:59,379 --> 00:59:01,567
Ever since I can remember he's
been married to this place.

1081
00:59:01,821 --> 00:59:03,221
Mom used to say the same thing.

1082
00:59:04,029 --> 00:59:06,604
They were great together,
Mr Staples. Mum and Dad.

1083
00:59:07,104 --> 00:59:09,351
They used to yell and
argue and carry on.

1084
00:59:09,865 --> 00:59:10,854
He was a fighter.

00:59:22,905 --> 00:59:23,863
Thank you, Mark.

00:59:43,431 --> 00:59:45,088
There's another bundle on the truck.

1088
00:59:58,598 --> 01:00:01,047
Mr Staples. You left your
hat in Mr Briggs' office.

1089
01:00:01,215 --> 01:00:04,355
Fred, I've the Stanley contract made up.
─ Later, please.

1090
01:00:05,944 --> 01:00:06,944
A bad night.

1091
01:00:13,676 --> 01:00:14,675
Yes, Mr Staples?

1092
01:00:15,291 --> 01:00:17,199
Now this is the proposals report.

1093
01:00:17,474 --> 01:00:20,050
Give that to Miss Lanier for
confidential mimeo-ing.

1094
01:00:20,279 --> 01:00:23,162
Tell her that Mr Briggs has the
only carbon. Is he in yet?

1095
01:00:23,341 --> 01:00:24,073
No, sir.

1096
01:00:24,543 --> 01:00:25,799
Mr Staples.
─ Yes?

1097
01:00:26,063 --> 01:00:27,048
It's not signed.

1098
01:00:27,873 --> 01:00:30,320
How would you like the
names? In what order?

1099
01:00:30,803 --> 01:00:34,319
First yours, or first Mr Briggs?
─ I don't care. It makes no difference.

1100
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:35,927
But a joint project, sir?

1101
01:00:36,027 --> 01:00:39,615
I really don't think it's too important.
Put Mr Briggs name first if you like.

1102
01:00:40,262 --> 01:00:42,193
Just give it to Miss Lanier, right away.

1103
01:00:42,927 --> 01:00:45,213
I'd like this thing printed
by afternoon if possible.

1104
01:00:48,018 --> 01:00:49,033
That's all, Marge.

1105
01:01:05,196 --> 01:01:06,375
Yes Marge, what is it?

1106
01:01:06,475 --> 01:01:08,714
Proposals report. Will you
sign it so it can be printed?

1107
01:01:08,814 --> 01:01:09,745
Would you ..?

1108
01:01:11,477 --> 01:01:12,614
Just a moment, please.

1109
01:01:12,714 --> 01:01:15,369
Marge, would you please take it in to
Mr Ramsey. He asked to see it first.

1110
01:01:15,912 --> 01:01:16,586
Hello?

1111
01:01:17,493 --> 01:01:18,597
Oh yes, good morning.

1112
01:01:19,727 --> 01:01:21,160
Is that the report?
─ Yes, sir.

1113
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:23,417
Miss Lanier said you wanted to see it.
─ Yes, I do.

1114
01:01:24,328 --> 01:01:25,288
Who signed this?

1115
01:01:25,498 --> 01:01:27,879
I wrote the title page.
Mr Staples suggested I sign it.

1116
01:01:32,788 --> 01:01:33,546
Print it.

1117
01:01:33,743 --> 01:01:36,034
I'm sure that if Mr Staples knew ..
─ Print it, Miss Fleming.

1118
01:01:44,324 --> 01:01:45,800
I can sign that report now, Marge.

1119
01:01:53,006 --> 01:01:54,609
Now we meet with Ramsey in 20 minutes.

1120
01:01:54,709 --> 01:01:58,026
Under the conditions and the time we've
got, it's the best plan I can devise.

1121
01:01:58,212 --> 01:02:00,487
It's the only one ready, so you
fellows have got to go along.

1122
01:02:01,222 --> 01:02:03,454
Marge, I can sign that report now.

1123
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:11,686
Thank you, Marge.

1124
01:02:21,736 --> 01:02:23,827
The major projects during the
period aforementioned ..

1125
01:02:23,927 --> 01:02:25,877
Being the Huber Petroleum Refinery.

1126
01:02:26,353 --> 01:02:29,638
The Sterling Carstairs Refinery.
The Chatham Nichols Smelter Company.

1127
01:02:30,019 --> 01:02:32,671
The Henderson Valley Dam.
The Swincarbon Steam Plant.

1128
01:02:33,088 --> 01:02:35,490
And the New England Canadian
natural gas pipeline.

1129
01:02:35,994 --> 01:02:37,439
A good report, Van.

1130
01:02:38,074 --> 01:02:40,205
I get a real feeling of
activity doing your reading.

1131
01:02:42,690 --> 01:02:46,105
The next item of business is
the projects proposal report.

1132
01:02:47,332 --> 01:02:49,978
Clearly, of the the greatest single
importance on our docket this morning.

1133
01:02:50,417 --> 01:02:52,126
I must say, and I'm
sure you all agree ..

1134
01:02:52,226 --> 01:02:54,933
That I am not given to enthusiasms
at the drop of a submission.

1135
01:02:55,925 --> 01:02:59,424
But of this, I'm impelled to say that it
is unique in effort, genius and thought.

1136
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:04,517
To Mr Staples of our organization goes
my heartfelt thanks and congratulations.

1137
01:03:05,247 --> 01:03:08,792
Besides being our newest member,
he is shaping up as our most astute.

1138
01:03:09,547 --> 01:03:13,266
This set of proposals is ingenious
comprehensive and fresh.

1139
01:03:13,821 --> 01:03:14,779
Congratulations.

1140
01:03:15,410 --> 01:03:18,249
Your success is a reaffirmation of my
own judgement.         ─ Mr Ramsey.

1141
01:03:18,349 --> 01:03:20,202
My own <i>good</i> judgement, I may add.
─ Mr Ramsey.

1142
01:03:20,302 --> 01:03:22,281
I prefer not to be drenched
in modesty Mr Staples.

1143
01:03:22,381 --> 01:03:25,816
This is not modesty, just the
extension of credit where it's due.

1144
01:03:26,181 --> 01:03:27,753
Bill is as responsible as ..
─ Mr Briggs.

1145
01:03:27,853 --> 01:03:29,879
Is your name about to be used in vain?

1146
01:03:30,531 --> 01:03:32,553
I don't think Fred would
use my name in vain.

1147
01:03:32,782 --> 01:03:35,925
It is refreshing to find someone
not suffering from over-modesty.

1148
01:03:36,331 --> 01:03:39,453
What I was trying to say is, that we
worked on this project together.

1149
01:03:39,654 --> 01:03:40,869
It was a combined effort.

1150
01:03:41,093 --> 01:03:42,053
I'm sure it was.

1151
01:03:42,797 --> 01:03:44,309
Well as long as that's understood.

1152
01:03:44,409 --> 01:03:46,647
Oh it is. It is.
It's just that I feel ..

1153
01:03:46,815 --> 01:03:49,339
Reasonably competent to assess
the individual performances.

1154
01:03:49,679 --> 01:03:52,699
And to single out those that
I feel should be singled out.

1155
01:03:53,032 --> 01:03:56,622
With all due regard for Mr Staples'
concern for his fellow man.

1156
01:03:59,078 --> 01:04:02,109
Now then, if Mr Briggs' ego
has been sufficiently nourished ..

1157
01:04:02,209 --> 01:04:04,336
I don't think Fred brought
this up to feed my ego.

1158
01:04:04,531 --> 01:04:08,115
Oh, well whatever it was that prompted
his precipitate dash to your defense.

1159
01:04:08,282 --> 01:04:11,044
There was no dash to my defense.
─ Why not drop the thing, Mr Briggs?

1160
01:04:11,528 --> 01:04:14,491
I hate becoming entangled in
absurd little personality conflicts.

1161
01:04:14,711 --> 01:04:17,472
I'll put a star by your name on the
front cover if that will make you happy.

1162
01:04:17,572 --> 01:04:19,742
My name is no longer on the front cover.
─ Mr Briggs.

1163
01:04:19,953 --> 01:04:23,306
You're twisting the thing to make it
seem I'm grubbing for some recognition.

1164
01:04:23,513 --> 01:04:24,332
Mr Briggs.

1165
01:04:24,549 --> 01:04:27,304
I find it unfair, Mr Ramsey.
─ We have a full agenda.

1166
01:04:28,059 --> 01:04:31,374
If you feel so bruised that you must
persist in prolonging this discussion.

1167
01:04:31,561 --> 01:04:34,416
Mr Ramsey!
Let me finish Mr Staples, if I may.

1168
01:04:35,095 --> 01:04:37,309
We have only one purpose here. To work.

1169
01:04:38,089 --> 01:04:41,520
We cannot hope to accomplish this if we
must be continually subjected to the ..

1170
01:04:41,702 --> 01:04:44,073
To these singularly unbecoming
strains and tensions.

1171
01:04:44,458 --> 01:04:46,258
These childish claims
and counter-claims.

1172
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:49,576
Mr Briggs, I asked
you a simple question.

1173
01:04:50,270 --> 01:04:53,866
Is it or is not within my province to
credit a man with a job well done?

1174
01:04:54,039 --> 01:04:55,991
Of course it is.
─ Then may we drop it now?

1175
01:04:56,091 --> 01:04:57,574
Only if it's clearly understood ..

1176
01:04:57,674 --> 01:05:00,480
That I do not submit to these calculated
discolorations of a man's worth.

1177
01:05:00,740 --> 01:05:04,362
As to a man's worth, Mr Briggs, I think
I have proven myself a competent judge.

1178
01:05:05,056 --> 01:05:08,885
I ask you to recall I built the business
from a scratch-pile of used lumber ..

1179
01:05:09,064 --> 01:05:10,693
And a few machines into a giant.

1180
01:05:11,007 --> 01:05:12,572
And I made few mistakes in doing it.

1181
01:05:13,060 --> 01:05:15,322
Few mistakes in business and
few mistakes in judging men.

1182
01:05:15,422 --> 01:05:17,029
You've made one here, this report ..

1183
01:05:17,129 --> 01:05:18,897
I refuse to engage in a running fight ..

1184
01:05:18,997 --> 01:05:21,354
Because a supposedly responsible
official of this company ..

1185
01:05:21,454 --> 01:05:23,878
Persists in wasting time
haggling over credit.

1186
01:05:24,106 --> 01:05:26,201
That is not fair.
─ I was not haggling over credit.

1187
01:05:26,708 --> 01:05:28,349
This is a joint report we worked on.

1188
01:05:28,449 --> 01:05:30,365
Don't tell me what is true
and what is not true.

1189
01:05:30,590 --> 01:05:33,663
What am I, some kind of idiot? That I
can't recognize another man's thinking?

1190
01:05:34,074 --> 01:05:36,062
Whatever your abilities
in the past, Mr Briggs.

1191
01:05:36,162 --> 01:05:39,447
Your work hasn't shown this stamp of
originality and talent in ten years.

1192
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:43,016
A man slips, clutches.
He loses his grip.

1193
01:05:43,383 --> 01:05:45,049
He tries to hand on by someone else's.

1194
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:47,106
You have no right to say that.

1195
01:05:48,213 --> 01:05:49,600
Bill, will you please speak up.

1196
01:05:51,154 --> 01:05:52,533
Do by all means, Mr Briggs.

1197
01:05:53,756 --> 01:05:55,144
You think I'm mistaken, do you?

1198
01:05:56,237 --> 01:05:57,885
Can I go through 150 pages ..

1199
01:05:58,051 --> 01:06:01,354
And point out to you line by line, where
another man has taken over for you?

1200
01:06:01,454 --> 01:06:02,826
Has <i>had</i> to take over for you.

1201
01:06:02,926 --> 01:06:05,644
And I can point out sections of this
report that I never had to touch.

1202
01:06:05,852 --> 01:06:07,689
Had to, Mr Staples? Of course you can.

1203
01:06:08,132 --> 01:06:11,373
Let me show them to you. I've seen
them submitted, year after year.

1204
01:06:11,958 --> 01:06:14,288
"Principles and precepts
for better business."

1205
01:06:14,819 --> 01:06:16,691
Mr Briggs' yearly platitudes.

1206
01:06:17,365 --> 01:06:20,261
But you translated his unworkable
well-intentioned philosophy.

1207
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:22,123
Into tough business procedures.

1208
01:06:22,721 --> 01:06:23,710
You make it work.

1209
01:06:23,965 --> 01:06:24,668
Ramsey!

1210
01:06:24,859 --> 01:06:28,008
Mr Briggs, I will not tolerate
insubordination on any level.

1211
01:06:28,427 --> 01:06:30,382
And if anyone here
finds that intolerable ..

1212
01:06:30,482 --> 01:06:32,815
He has the God-given right
to offer his resignation.

1213
01:06:45,701 --> 01:06:46,345
Bill.

1214
01:06:48,184 --> 01:06:48,885
Please.

1215
01:06:51,570 --> 01:06:52,603
Mister Ramsey.

1216
01:06:54,808 --> 01:06:57,349
I had no intention of
seeming insubordinate.

1217
01:07:14,229 --> 01:07:15,364
Meeting is adjourned.

1218
01:07:27,486 --> 01:07:28,273
Mr Briggs.

1219
01:07:33,254 --> 01:07:34,043
Mr Briggs.

1220
01:07:36,701 --> 01:07:38,131
Miss Lanier! Miss Lanier!

1221
01:07:38,382 --> 01:07:39,026
Bill.

1222
01:07:40,077 --> 01:07:41,228
Bill, can you hear me?

1223
01:07:41,741 --> 01:07:42,556
A little ..

1224
01:07:43,205 --> 01:07:44,831
A little .. bottle of pills.

1225
01:07:45,736 --> 01:07:47,443
In my coat .. in the office.

1226
01:07:47,936 --> 01:07:49,241
Get some water.
─ Yes, sir.

1227
01:07:49,821 --> 01:07:52,295
Grannigan, get an ambulance.
And call Dr Fletcher.

1228
01:07:52,602 --> 01:07:53,584
Don't move him.

1229
01:07:54,243 --> 01:07:54,919
Fred.

1230
01:07:56,113 --> 01:07:58,900
Bill .. still giving .. audits.

1231
01:08:00,094 --> 01:08:01,488
Do me a favor, Fred.

1232
01:08:01,953 --> 01:08:02,769
What, Bill?

1233
01:08:03,342 --> 01:08:04,264
Tell him ..

1234
01:08:05,239 --> 01:08:06,056
Tell him ..

1235
01:08:06,769 --> 01:08:07,610
Go to ..

1236
01:08:20,891 --> 01:08:22,443
[ Telephone ]

1237
01:08:27,058 --> 01:08:27,873
Hello?

1238
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:33,410
Thank you, Mr Staples.

1239
01:08:37,870 --> 01:08:38,857
Five minutes ago.

1240
01:08:55,809 --> 01:08:57,310
We just had word from the hospital.

1241
01:08:58,472 --> 01:08:59,963
He died five minutes ago.

1242
01:09:01,675 --> 01:09:02,862
Thank you, Mr Grannigan.

1243
01:10:59,828 --> 01:11:00,500
Nancy?

1244
01:11:01,307 --> 01:11:02,494
What are you doing here?

1245
01:11:02,948 --> 01:11:04,049
I called your office.

1246
01:11:05,059 --> 01:11:07,003
And there wasn't any
train, so I drove here.

1247
01:11:10,394 --> 01:11:11,869
How did you know where to find me?

1248
01:11:12,853 --> 01:11:14,183
They told me at the hospital.

1249
01:11:17,110 --> 01:11:18,524
Does Paul know?

1250
01:11:21,951 --> 01:11:23,095
Yes, he's with ..

1251
01:11:23,606 --> 01:11:24,907
Bill's sister. He's alright.

1252
01:11:25,743 --> 01:11:27,073
You care for something, Miss?

1253
01:11:30,010 --> 01:11:31,453
Have you had anything to eat?

1254
01:11:32,455 --> 01:11:33,143
Huh?

1255
01:11:34,614 --> 01:11:36,156
Have you <i>eaten</i> anything?

1256
01:11:41,753 --> 01:11:42,478
Fred.

1257
01:11:44,205 --> 01:11:45,106
What happened?

1258
01:11:46,959 --> 01:11:47,688
Nothing.

1259
01:11:49,438 --> 01:11:50,429
Not a thing.

1260
01:11:52,010 --> 01:11:53,016
Except a murder.

1261
01:11:54,938 --> 01:11:56,674
There were witnesses, too. Plenty of us.

1262
01:11:58,625 --> 01:12:01,578
And no-one lifted a finger to stop it.
─ Oh, Fred.

1263
01:12:01,758 --> 01:12:04,442
Nancy, I know. I didn't lift a finger.
─ You <i>don't </i>know.

1264
01:12:05,464 --> 01:12:07,888
I'm not going to have you going
around in sackcloth and ashes ..

1265
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:10,711
For something that you did
everything in your power to stop.

1266
01:12:11,322 --> 01:12:13,335
You begged him to resign. You know that.

1267
01:12:13,819 --> 01:12:15,231
What more could you have done?

1268
01:12:15,513 --> 01:12:16,960
What more could anyone have done?

1269
01:12:17,515 --> 01:12:19,163
Nancy, I think you had better go home.

1270
01:12:19,577 --> 01:12:20,932
Would you check this please?

1271
01:12:21,748 --> 01:12:23,150
Are you coming?
─ Nope.

1272
01:12:24,442 --> 01:12:25,402
Then I won't go.

1273
01:12:25,745 --> 01:12:27,685
I want you to go home and start packing.

1274
01:12:29,419 --> 01:12:30,553
Where are we going?

1275
01:12:31,289 --> 01:12:33,279
I don't know. Somewhere. Anywhere.

1276
01:12:34,672 --> 01:12:35,578
Just away.

1277
01:12:36,502 --> 01:12:39,253
There's an awful stink in this town
and we're going to get away from it.

1278
01:12:42,337 --> 01:12:44,966
Come on, I'll put you in the car.
─ No, I'm not going to leave you alone.

1279
01:12:45,191 --> 01:12:48,266
Nancy, I want you to go home, please.
─ No, I'm not going tonight.

1280
01:12:48,489 --> 01:12:49,990
Tomorrow, I'll do anything you ask.

1281
01:12:50,156 --> 01:12:53,368
I'll pack, I'll go anywhere you ask. But
not tonight, not in the state you're in.

1282
01:12:53,539 --> 01:12:55,756
Look. There's something I've got to do.
─ Fine.

1283
01:12:56,329 --> 01:12:57,573
Then we'll do it together.

1284
01:13:44,767 --> 01:13:47,858
Bill was meant to go to Lansing tomorrow
morning for a meeting with Phillips.

1285
01:13:48,699 --> 01:13:50,060
You'll have to take his place.

1286
01:13:50,832 --> 01:13:52,419
I believe I've already mentioned that.

1287
01:13:52,856 --> 01:13:54,014
Yeah. You mentioned it.

1288
01:13:59,536 --> 01:14:01,673
You'll leave on flight number 116.

1289
01:14:01,883 --> 01:14:03,160
8:32 from LaGuärdia.

1290
01:14:04,849 --> 01:14:07,313
Miss Lanier will meet you at the
airport with your reservation ..

1291
01:14:07,413 --> 01:14:10,395
And all the memoranda and correspondence
pertaining to the negotiations.

1292
01:14:11,241 --> 01:14:13,238
You'll have three uninterrupted
hours in the air ..

1293
01:14:13,338 --> 01:14:15,154
To familiarize yourself
with all the details.

1294
01:14:16,332 --> 01:14:18,996
I have no interest whatever
in the Phillips matter.

1295
01:14:19,955 --> 01:14:20,856
What was that?

1296
01:14:21,310 --> 01:14:23,590
I'm telling you that I don't
want the job. I'm through.

1297
01:14:23,690 --> 01:14:26,030
I'm quitting. I resign as of now.

1298
01:14:26,365 --> 01:14:27,007
Why?

1299
01:14:27,183 --> 01:14:28,838
Because I hate your guts.

1300
01:14:29,616 --> 01:14:31,661
You used Bill Briggs for a whipping boy.

1301
01:14:32,139 --> 01:14:34,356
You made him knuckle under
and then you beat him to death.

1302
01:14:34,548 --> 01:14:37,479
You wouldn't try anything like that
with me because I'd kill you first.

1303
01:14:38,218 --> 01:14:40,019
I'm not a nice human being. What else?

1304
01:14:40,272 --> 01:14:41,545
You're nothing but a freak!

1305
01:14:41,884 --> 01:14:45,683
You drive your people to peak efficiency
if they make it or a grave if they can't.

1306
01:14:46,468 --> 01:14:49,047
Because Bill lacked the strength ..
─ And the perspicacity.

1307
01:14:49,519 --> 01:14:50,741
He was second in command.

1308
01:14:51,019 --> 01:14:53,044
He'd a lot of responsibility
to hold and he cracked.

1309
01:14:53,144 --> 01:14:55,726
It was <i>his</i> business, too.
─ It's no-one's business.

1310
01:14:56,145 --> 01:14:57,446
It belongs only to the best.

1311
01:14:57,861 --> 01:15:00,885
To those who can control it, sustain it,
nurture it, keep it growing.

1312
01:15:01,694 --> 01:15:03,885
Right now it belongs to us
because we're producing.

1313
01:15:04,347 --> 01:15:06,578
But in the future it belongs
to whoever has the brains ..

1314
01:15:06,821 --> 01:15:08,747
The nerve and the skill
to take it away from us.

1315
01:15:08,961 --> 01:15:11,691
Well, they can have my share of it right
now, as I don't want any part of it.

1316
01:15:11,791 --> 01:15:13,601
What do you want from me? Apologies?

1317
01:15:14,154 --> 01:15:15,418
I don't apologize!

1318
01:15:17,063 --> 01:15:17,859
What else?

1319
01:15:19,287 --> 01:15:21,024
A nice, unsullied conscience?

1320
01:15:22,271 --> 01:15:24,875
Do you walk out of there with a
halo because you spoke your mind?

1321
01:15:25,737 --> 01:15:26,811
What do you do then?

1322
01:15:27,310 --> 01:15:30,543
Go to work for some nickel and
dime outfit run by "nice" people?

1323
01:15:30,784 --> 01:15:32,997
Who won't challenge you
and prod you and goad you.

1324
01:15:33,281 --> 01:15:35,435
And drive you to a height
you never even dreamed of.

1325
01:15:36,041 --> 01:15:38,630
A company where there is nothing
to fight for, because you are the best.

1326
01:15:38,891 --> 01:15:40,265
Where there is no competition.

1327
01:15:40,911 --> 01:15:44,567
Where everything is handed to you.
And nothing is worth fighting for.

1328
01:15:45,297 --> 01:15:46,709
I want you to stay.

1329
01:15:48,589 --> 01:15:50,508
I don't think you understand, Ramsey.

1330
01:15:51,274 --> 01:15:53,982
I don't like you.
I don't like anything about you.

1331
01:15:54,185 --> 01:15:55,648
I didn't hire you to like me.

1332
01:15:56,168 --> 01:15:58,452
Alright. I'm not a nice
person in your eyes.

1333
01:15:58,888 --> 01:16:02,021
But whatever I am, you'll learn
more, grow more and do more ..

1334
01:16:02,121 --> 01:16:03,854
Here with me than
anywhere else on earth.

1335
01:16:04,510 --> 01:16:07,188
I want you to stay because
I need help on my level.

1336
01:16:07,653 --> 01:16:09,702
And you're the only one
who's able to function there.

1337
01:16:10,347 --> 01:16:13,114
Be a conscience for me if you want.
Be anything you like.

1338
01:16:13,771 --> 01:16:16,245
And if it's something I don't like
you'll know about it soon enough.

1339
01:16:17,139 --> 01:16:18,786
I think you're strong enough to take it.

1340
01:16:19,222 --> 01:16:21,239
And if not, I think you're
strong enough to get out.

1341
01:16:22,350 --> 01:16:23,441
Name your terms!

1342
01:16:23,667 --> 01:16:25,058
All terms are negotiable.

1343
01:16:26,581 --> 01:16:27,645
I don't think so.

1344
01:16:28,225 --> 01:16:29,030
Not mine.

1345
01:16:29,457 --> 01:16:30,220
Alright.

1346
01:16:30,936 --> 01:16:32,960
I'd just as soon not waste
any time doing trading.

1347
01:16:34,071 --> 01:16:35,846
As of now, your salary is doubled.

1348
01:16:37,242 --> 01:16:39,173
Your stock option is doubled
right down the line.

1349
01:16:40,685 --> 01:16:42,502
Your expense account is
whatever you make it.

1350
01:16:42,956 --> 01:16:44,854
Add to that a new title: Vice President.

1351
01:16:48,637 --> 01:16:49,960
I want a lot more than that.

1352
01:16:50,862 --> 01:16:54,398
You're not taking me on as just another
Vice President you can just push around.

1353
01:16:55,613 --> 01:16:58,907
You'll take me as someone who
hates you down to the bare nerves.

1354
01:16:59,091 --> 01:17:00,850
Nothing in the world
will ever change that.

1355
01:17:01,394 --> 01:17:05,278
I'll argue with you, contradict you,
fight you in every way I know how.

1356
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:09,329
I'll do everything in my power to push
you out and take your place myself.

1357
01:17:10,007 --> 01:17:10,994
Go ahead and try.

1358
01:17:12,585 --> 01:17:13,408
Mr Staples.

1359
01:17:14,204 --> 01:17:15,422
You have yourself a deal.

1360
01:17:16,348 --> 01:17:17,334
Have it drawn up.

1361
01:17:18,452 --> 01:17:20,076
No reservations now?

1362
01:17:23,366 --> 01:17:24,299
Yes. One.

1363
01:17:25,606 --> 01:17:27,506
Bill had one pitiful little dream.

1364
01:17:27,693 --> 01:17:30,012
That someday he'd walk in
here and break your jaw.

1365
01:17:31,460 --> 01:17:33,799
I reserve the right to
have that wish for myself.

1366
01:17:35,260 --> 01:17:36,908
I'll have it drawn into to the contract.

1367
01:17:37,641 --> 01:17:39,652
With a little rider giving
me the same privilege.

1368
01:17:48,485 --> 01:17:50,713
Oh .. Staples.

1369
01:17:51,624 --> 01:17:54,520
You'll be pleased to know that Bill
Briggs' boy is being taken care of.

1370
01:17:58,473 --> 01:18:00,369
Well, that lets you
sleep better tonight.

1371
01:18:02,381 --> 01:18:03,356
It begins, huh?

1372
01:18:05,162 --> 01:18:06,618
It begins .. fair enough?

1373
01:18:08,226 --> 01:18:09,069
Fair enough.

1374
01:18:49,487 --> 01:18:50,302
Do we pack?

1375
01:18:52,404 --> 01:18:54,155
No .. we stay.

1376
01:18:55,545 --> 01:18:57,417
On whose terms?
─ Mine.

1377
01:18:59,167 --> 01:18:59,896
And his.

1378
01:19:01,284 --> 01:19:02,918
Are you satisfied?
─ Yes.

1379
01:19:03,896 --> 01:19:04,889
Oh, Fred.

1380
01:19:05,362 --> 01:19:08,706
You know it's easy enough to chuck
something you thiñk is wrong.

1381
01:19:10,032 --> 01:19:11,878
I don't know. This way
maybe there's a çhance.

1382
01:19:12,164 --> 01:19:13,140
I'm so happy.

1383
01:19:13,824 --> 01:19:14,785
Well, we'll see.

1384
01:19:16,247 --> 01:19:17,522
I've got to go to Lansing.

1385
01:19:18,235 --> 01:19:19,250
The morning plane.

1386
01:19:19,624 --> 01:19:21,743
When will you be back?
─ Tomorrow night.

1387
01:19:23,041 --> 01:19:23,971
I'll be late.

1388
01:19:26,079 --> 01:19:27,094
Aren't you always?

1389
01:20:13,875 --> 01:20:14,956
T-G
