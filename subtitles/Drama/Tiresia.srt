1
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:13,666
Soon I'll be in my garden of roses.
Soon. I'm waiting.31

2
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:15,768
Roses full of thorns.

3
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:18,933
Fake scents.
Better than real ones.

4
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:31,647
The original is vulgar
because of its past.

5
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:34,418
It was only a try, an attempt.

6
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:38,620
The illusion is not the real thing.
The copy is perfect.

7
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:53,002
The copy is perfect.

8
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:56,342
As I see it.
As I smell it.

9
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:59,812
Again in my garden tonight.
Again roses.

10
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:03,149
Even if there's only one.
A beautiful day.

11
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:21,028
No more sleeping without you.
No more sleeping anyway.

12
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:18,352
Poor garden.
Shitty little garden.

13
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:20,219
Not one flower that's real.

14
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:24,525
Shitty little garden.
No scents.

15
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,398
All of you, my roses.
I'm almost there.

16
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:33,060
I want to know you all.
In fact, I do.

17
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:35,399
You, you, and you.
I know you.

18
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:37,906
Wait for me.
I'm almost there.

19
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:40,773
My garden of roses.
Thorny roses.

20
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:43,575
Fake scents.
Better than real ones.

21
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:46,013
The original is a vulgar attempt.

22
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:42,631
Everything is wrong tonight.

23
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:51,948
She went partying with that couple.

24
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:55,480
Then with her husband.

25
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:58,614
Fuck!

26
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,860
- She came back already.
- Oh my God!

27
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:10,230
He only took her for 20 minutes.

28
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,871
Where are you going?

29
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:24,380
- I'll show you a great time.
- Today is her turn.

30
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:57,607
Look at him.
He's very handsome.

31
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:07,279
Katie, we haven't made enough money
to even buy rice and beans.

32
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:13,085
Not even enough for the market.

33
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:14,624
Hey, Fares, don't go for that one.

34
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:17,593
He's got his hands in his pockets.
He's got nothing.

35
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,197
- Let's find another one.
- Yeah, okay.

36
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,595
We're expensive.

37
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:23,928
I know.

38
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:31,305
Hi, darling.
What are we doing?

39
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:37,039
Come here, my love.

40
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,911
Kimi, look at this guy over here.

41
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:40,450
I don't even want to look right now.

42
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:42,075
I saw him from far away
and got nervous.

43
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:44,745
- Look. He wants you.
- You think so?

44
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:48,883
Hey, want some pleasure?

45
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,619
Real pleasure.

46
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:52,627
What do you think?

47
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:54,959
Hey, where are you going?

48
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:57,423
Hey, what happened?

49
00:10:57,523 --> 00:10:59,503
I don't know what happened.

50
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:02,801
You let him go.
Now you're all alone.

51
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,942
That's a nice car.

52
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:09,206
Go with that one.

53
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,998
It's not working.

54
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:39,474
There's no money to even leave.

55
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:41,971
I'm not gonna stay here.

56
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:14,101
All with hat in hand

57
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,706
The first is her father

58
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:23,844
The second is her brother

59
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:26,184
And the third

60
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:33,287
Is who won Theresa's hand

61
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:38,061
Theresinha rises

62
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:42,606
She rose from the floor

63
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:45,175
And smiling

64
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,767
She tells the man:

65
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:53,783
"I will give you my heart"

66
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:58,549
I want a slice of orange

67
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:03,525
And a piece of lemon

68
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:08,190
And from the prettiest girl

69
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:14,499
I want a kiss and a hug

70
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:19,565
And lots of ripe oranges

71
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:24,978
Lots of fallen lemons

72
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:30,144
Lots of spilled blood

73
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:35,021
Inside my heart

74
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:40,086
Jesus's' Theresinha

75
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:45,397
Has fallen down

76
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:51,703
Three knights have come

77
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:56,075
All with hat in hand

78
00:13:57,069 --> 00:14:03,577
Theresinha rises

79
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:12,696
I'm coming.

80
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:31,973
Is that your sister?

81
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:33,705
Yeah. She's coming.
Oh, there she is.

82
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:34,411
Yeah. She's coming.
Oh, there she is.

83
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:36,110
Oh, honey.
You won't die anytime soon.

84
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:39,018
- How are you doing?
- Good, good.

85
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:43,116
You can talk about me.
But only good things.

86
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,923
It's not enough.

87
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:51,301
- Can I talk to you?
- Okay.

88
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,336
Bye. Later.

89
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:57,702
So, this is what it should be.

90
00:14:57,796 --> 00:15:02,040
He wants a girl and a transsexual.

91
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:03,511
Understand? Both.

92
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:08,176
He's a rich American.
You got it? Understand?

93
00:15:08,273 --> 00:15:12,312
So we'll split it.
A percentage goes to the house.

94
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:15,722
The rest is yours.
Do whatever you want with it.

95
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:18,158
Just don't let him hurt you.

96
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:23,427
No, no, no! I won't let him.
Of course not.

97
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,966
I'll run away. I'll really run.

98
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,901
- Good idea.
- No, no, no.

99
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:32,339
Can you tighten this for me?

100
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:35,311
It's good. It's good.

101
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,676
It's really cold.

102
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:42,109
Hi, darling.
Any work? Nothing.

103
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:45,586
There aren't any cars.
No one's driving by.

104
00:15:45,677 --> 00:15:48,123
Horrible. Terrible.

105
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:50,352
How are you, darling?
Did you work a lot today?

106
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,553
Many clients?

107
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:54,859
A lot? You're tired, then.
You'll go home soon.

108
00:15:54,953 --> 00:15:56,694
That's good.

109
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:12,443
Take a look. This?

110
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:15,951
Give it to him. Okay?

111
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:19,386
No, no, just give it to him.

112
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:22,516
More money won't make it last longer.

113
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:23,957
And you drive me back.

114
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:25,687
No problem.

115
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:28,689
You can touch me.

116
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:30,289
Not now.

117
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:16,842
Want a drink?

118
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:18,881
I'll take a Coke.

119
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:21,484
Don't have any.

120
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:24,253
Whatever.

121
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:26,851
Water?

122
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:29,985
Okay.

123
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,505
Here.

124
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:51,103
Thanks.

125
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:09,230
Please don't undress.

126
00:18:11,089 --> 00:18:12,568
Don't you want to have sex?

127
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:13,602
No.

128
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:18,732
- I'm a whore.
- I don't believe so.

129
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,867
Well, maybe. But I don't care.

130
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:24,072
I'll undress. We'll have sex.

131
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,081
All right?

132
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,075
Come here.

133
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:31,807
Now you belong to me.
You're going to live with me.

134
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,412
Hey! Listen!

135
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:47,027
Hey! I don't want to stay in here!

136
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,230
I'm going out.

137
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:52,658
To avoid those painful moments.

138
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:55,136
You asking me to let you go.

139
00:19:56,561 --> 00:19:59,735
You, screaming.
I can't stand screaming.

140
00:20:00,665 --> 00:20:02,872
You saying it's impossible.

141
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:04,447
Because it is possible.

142
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:09,645
Let's save some time.
I'll be back when we have it.

143
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:20,456
Are you okay?

144
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:23,617
I'm just not used to drinking.

145
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:25,789
But it's good?

146
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:27,329
Yes, it is.

147
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,812
I left Brazil.

148
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:25,911
I escaped Immigration here.

149
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,491
You won't be the one
who locks me up.

150
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:31,925
If my brother finds you,
he'll kill you.

151
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,293
He'll cut your balls off.

152
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:39,199
Let me out of here!
You fucking bastard!

153
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:59,821
You son of a bitch!

154
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:04,317
Let me go!

155
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:06,824
Let me out of here!

156
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:09,262
This rotten place!

157
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:13,063
I can't take it anymore!

158
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:15,001
Fuck!

159
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:20,442
You're an idiot!
I hate you! I hate you!

160
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:24,937
Sit down.

161
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:29,812
Don't be afraid. I won't hurt you.

162
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:32,612
Sit down.

163
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,375
I'm glad to see you calm now.

164
00:23:57,168 --> 00:23:59,114
I was afraid you wouldn't understand.

165
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:00,808
I don't understand.

166
00:24:14,552 --> 00:24:16,589
Do you want to eat?

167
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:29,709
Sorry. This is to sleep with you.

168
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:44,852
It hurts.

169
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:38,772
I'm a little girl.

170
00:25:39,537 --> 00:25:41,016
Fuck me.

171
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,376
Be quiet. Sleep.

172
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,361
How long must I stay here?

173
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:36,133
I don't know.

174
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:40,408
Aren't you hungry?

175
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:46,711
Come and eat.

176
00:27:10,728 --> 00:27:12,105
Here.

177
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,340
Eat.

178
00:27:26,077 --> 00:27:28,250
It's not poisoned. Eat.

179
00:27:58,076 --> 00:28:00,181
I need other clothes.

180
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:05,860
Sing for me
what you sang in the woods.

181
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,527
What's it about?

182
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,846
I don't want to be tied up.

183
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,792
Then not so tightly.

184
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:43,889
I'll try.

185
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:52,327
So how are you?

186
00:29:53,822 --> 00:30:01,536
Go on, life is great.
Move, have fun.

187
00:30:51,412 --> 00:30:52,857
You promised.

188
00:30:52,947 --> 00:30:54,119
Yes, yes.

189
00:32:00,481 --> 00:32:02,586
Look at what I am.

190
00:32:03,618 --> 00:32:05,620
It's inhuman.

191
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,495
It's disgusting.

192
00:32:11,292 --> 00:32:13,135
Take a good look.

193
00:32:15,897 --> 00:32:17,672
Take a good look!

194
00:32:28,476 --> 00:32:30,717
Please don't look at me.

195
00:32:32,613 --> 00:32:34,456
Let me wash.

196
00:32:36,351 --> 00:32:38,331
At least that.

197
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:17,613
I'll get the coffee.

198
00:36:47,268 --> 00:36:54,516
Jesus's' Theresinha
has fallen down.

199
00:36:56,477 --> 00:36:59,253
Three knights have come.

200
00:37:00,615 --> 00:37:03,892
All with hat in hand.

201
00:37:05,953 --> 00:37:08,229
The first is her father.

202
00:37:10,057 --> 00:37:12,560
The second is her brother.

203
00:37:14,295 --> 00:37:20,940
And the third
is who won Theresa's hand.

204
00:37:24,138 --> 00:37:27,381
Theresinha rises.

205
00:37:31,045 --> 00:37:33,184
And smiling,

206
00:37:36,651 --> 00:37:41,361
she tells the man,
"I'll give you my heart."

207
00:37:42,056 --> 00:37:45,196
And lots of ripe oranges.

208
00:37:45,893 --> 00:37:48,373
Lots of fallen lemons.

209
00:37:50,231 --> 00:37:57,376
Lots of spilled blood
inside my heart.

210
00:37:59,206 --> 00:38:03,746
I want a slice of orange

211
00:38:05,346 --> 00:38:07,553
and a piece of lemon.

212
00:38:08,416 --> 00:38:10,896
And from the prettiest girl,

213
00:38:12,186 --> 00:38:15,292
I want a kiss and a hug.

214
00:38:30,705 --> 00:38:32,946
How long have I been here?

215
00:38:34,008 --> 00:38:35,612
Don't know. Why?

216
00:38:37,411 --> 00:38:39,982
Just wanted to know.

217
00:42:11,091 --> 00:42:12,798
Eat with me.

218
00:42:12,893 --> 00:42:14,804
I can't stand being alone.

219
00:42:15,462 --> 00:42:17,601
I swear I'll stay calm.

220
00:42:20,067 --> 00:42:21,546
Please.

221
00:42:22,469 --> 00:42:23,880
Sit down.

222
00:42:24,672 --> 00:42:25,912
Come here.

223
00:42:26,774 --> 00:42:28,947
I promise I won't.

224
00:42:30,077 --> 00:42:31,988
I won't scream.

225
00:42:34,181 --> 00:42:35,660
Okay.

226
00:44:27,027 --> 00:44:31,840
You're attracted to transsexuals,
but you can't touch them.

227
00:44:32,666 --> 00:44:35,112
Yes, we have something special.

228
00:44:35,202 --> 00:44:37,443
It's a great joy.

229
00:44:38,305 --> 00:44:40,945
But it's a desperate joy.

230
00:44:42,409 --> 00:44:45,549
But you can't see that.

231
00:44:46,747 --> 00:44:48,852
I don't understand you.

232
00:44:49,316 --> 00:44:51,318
Can't explain it in French.

233
00:44:55,956 --> 00:44:58,163
I need to clean up.

234
00:46:07,659 --> 00:46:10,071
See what's happening?

235
00:46:12,597 --> 00:46:14,634
You know what I am.

236
00:46:16,601 --> 00:46:20,606
You know it's not natural.
It's chemical.

237
00:46:20,705 --> 00:46:21,877
Right?

238
00:46:23,508 --> 00:46:24,646
I know.

239
00:46:26,344 --> 00:46:27,914
It stopped working.

240
00:46:47,065 --> 00:46:48,544
How about it, honey?

241
00:46:48,633 --> 00:46:50,306
30 for a blowjob and love.

242
00:46:50,402 --> 00:46:52,575
- How do you...?
- What?

243
00:46:53,505 --> 00:46:55,678
- Is it hormones?
- What?

244
00:46:55,774 --> 00:46:56,912
Is it hormones?

245
00:46:57,008 --> 00:46:58,248
Get out of here.

246
00:46:58,343 --> 00:46:59,788
Do you have some on you?

247
00:46:59,878 --> 00:47:01,050
Get out of here.

248
00:47:01,146 --> 00:47:02,352
What's going on?

249
00:47:05,483 --> 00:47:06,461
What's the problem?

250
00:47:06,551 --> 00:47:09,157
I don't know, Eduardo.
He's talking about hormones.

251
00:47:09,254 --> 00:47:10,426
I have no idea what he wants.

252
00:47:10,522 --> 00:47:12,468
Tell him to leave, please.

253
00:47:13,191 --> 00:47:14,101
Problem?

254
00:47:14,192 --> 00:47:16,468
I'm going. I was only asking.

255
00:47:33,144 --> 00:47:34,919
Don't look at me.

256
00:47:40,552 --> 00:47:43,123
You know this can't go on.

257
00:47:44,923 --> 00:47:46,960
I can't get your hormones.

258
00:47:48,526 --> 00:47:51,234
Your friends will take you, kill me.

259
00:47:51,329 --> 00:47:53,002
Then let me go.

260
00:47:53,398 --> 00:47:55,378
Look at me.

261
00:47:55,934 --> 00:47:58,505
- This isn't what you want.
- It's the same.

262
00:47:59,337 --> 00:48:01,112
You'll come after me.

263
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:06,050
I swear I won't tell anyone
where you live or what you look like.

264
00:48:06,478 --> 00:48:09,015
You know you can trust me.

265
00:48:11,082 --> 00:48:14,325
At first, you'll be happy,
so you won't tell.

266
00:48:14,419 --> 00:48:15,625
But later...

267
00:48:19,524 --> 00:48:22,994
If you don't let me go,
then go and see my brother.

268
00:48:23,094 --> 00:48:25,335
His name's Eduardo.

269
00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:27,376
Tell him we're together.

270
00:48:27,465 --> 00:48:30,935
Tell him I belong to you,
that I'm your wife.

271
00:48:31,036 --> 00:48:33,380
Ask him for my hormones.

272
00:48:34,372 --> 00:48:37,512
Go and come back. I'll wait.

273
00:48:42,047 --> 00:48:44,254
Will you help me?

274
00:48:44,349 --> 00:48:45,885
Yes, I will.

275
00:48:48,186 --> 00:48:49,256
How?

276
00:49:00,732 --> 00:49:01,904
I'm going.

277
00:49:03,301 --> 00:49:04,780
I'm waiting.

278
00:49:06,871 --> 00:49:08,350
Be back soon.

279
00:49:24,823 --> 00:49:26,564
I'm tired.

280
00:49:27,125 --> 00:49:28,468
Rest.

281
00:49:34,799 --> 00:49:36,301
I love you.

282
00:56:37,789 --> 00:56:41,396
Jesus had just died on the cross.

283
00:56:41,492 --> 00:56:43,494
It was Friday.

284
00:56:43,628 --> 00:56:48,270
Bodies could not remain
on the cross on the Sabbath.

285
00:56:48,366 --> 00:56:52,405
So the Jews asked Pilate

286
00:56:52,503 --> 00:56:57,976
that the legs be broken
and that they be taken away.

287
00:56:58,075 --> 00:57:02,114
The soldiers broke the legs
of the first.

288
00:57:02,213 --> 00:57:04,124
Then the second.

289
00:57:04,215 --> 00:57:08,186
Those who were crucified with Jesus.

290
00:57:09,687 --> 00:57:13,829
They came to him
and saw he was already dead.

291
00:57:15,059 --> 00:57:18,233
They did not break his legs.

292
00:57:18,930 --> 00:57:25,176
But one of the soldiers with a spear
pierced his side.

293
00:57:26,304 --> 00:57:31,617
Blood and water
came out immediately.

294
00:57:31,709 --> 00:57:35,680
He that saw it bares record.

295
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:38,886
So that you would believe it, too.

296
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:58,102
"When he came out of the water,

297
00:57:58,736 --> 00:58:00,807
Jesus saw the heavens open.

298
00:58:01,706 --> 00:58:04,448
The Holy Spirit descended
as a dove upon him.

299
00:58:05,409 --> 00:58:08,049
A voice came from Heaven:

300
00:58:08,179 --> 00:58:11,092
'You are my beloved Son.

301
00:58:11,182 --> 00:58:13,856
I place all my love in you.'"

302
01:02:01,610 --> 01:02:03,590
Why not go to the hospital?

303
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:05,817
I don't want the police.

304
01:02:05,914 --> 01:02:08,292
I don't want to be sent back.

305
01:02:09,484 --> 01:02:11,225
I don't have papers.

306
01:02:14,423 --> 01:02:16,369
What's your name?

307
01:02:17,292 --> 01:02:19,329
Tiresia.

308
01:02:21,563 --> 01:02:23,839
So what should we do?

309
01:02:23,932 --> 01:02:25,138
I don't know.

310
01:02:26,334 --> 01:02:30,339
No matter what, my eyes are gone.
What's done is done.

311
01:02:35,143 --> 01:02:37,521
Very well.

312
01:02:37,612 --> 01:02:38,784
All right.

313
01:02:51,159 --> 01:02:55,505
Want to hear me out?
Want to know what I think?

314
01:02:55,597 --> 01:02:57,406
You're 17 years old.

315
01:02:59,434 --> 01:03:01,038
I'm never here.

316
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:05,347
I'm always working on the road.

317
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:09,946
That's it. That's all I have to say.

318
01:03:10,045 --> 01:03:12,491
I won't go against your will.

319
01:03:14,049 --> 01:03:15,722
But be careful.

320
01:03:16,485 --> 01:03:18,590
Be careful for you, okay?

321
01:03:22,424 --> 01:03:23,732
Promise?

322
01:04:36,498 --> 01:04:37,806
Don't help me.

323
01:04:38,833 --> 01:04:41,143
Watch me, that's all.

324
01:05:13,568 --> 01:05:16,412
If only you knew
what I did to be beautiful.

325
01:07:22,397 --> 01:07:24,434
I don't know how to repay you.

326
01:07:25,667 --> 01:07:27,408
How to thank you.

327
01:07:30,638 --> 01:07:32,515
I want you to come with me.

328
01:07:38,780 --> 01:07:42,728
I have a brother, Eduardo,
who will take care of me.

329
01:07:44,419 --> 01:07:47,866
I want him to thank you,
to give you something.

330
01:08:00,902 --> 01:08:02,074
What's that?

331
01:08:18,186 --> 01:08:19,995
You want your ball back?

332
01:08:20,421 --> 01:08:21,456
Yes.

333
01:08:22,056 --> 01:08:23,262
Go on.

334
01:08:35,837 --> 01:08:36,713
Anna.

335
01:08:37,172 --> 01:08:38,082
Anna.

336
01:08:38,206 --> 01:08:41,676
His brother is older.
Maybe 18, 20.

337
01:08:42,010 --> 01:08:43,512
Do you know him?

338
01:08:44,479 --> 01:08:46,288
Tonight...
How do I say it?

339
01:08:46,414 --> 01:08:49,054
He's going somewhere.
With people.

340
01:08:49,150 --> 01:08:52,324
Do what you can.
Find him, his family.

341
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:54,400
He shouldn't go.

342
01:09:48,076 --> 01:09:51,614
The alarm went off,
and they drove away.

343
01:09:51,713 --> 01:09:53,488
They had an accident.

344
01:09:54,449 --> 01:09:56,554
The two in front died instantly.

345
01:09:58,987 --> 01:10:03,663
Our son was in back.
He's hurt, but it's not serious.

346
01:10:04,392 --> 01:10:08,135
I'm sorry. Really.

347
01:10:08,229 --> 01:10:11,233
We should have listened.

348
01:10:11,332 --> 01:10:14,245
You saw the accident.

349
01:10:14,335 --> 01:10:17,373
You warned us. The girl came.

350
01:10:17,472 --> 01:10:19,418
I don't know.

351
01:10:19,507 --> 01:10:22,181
It came like that, a feeling.

352
01:10:22,277 --> 01:10:26,851
We thought you were crazy.
We shouldn't have.

353
01:10:27,749 --> 01:10:29,888
At the same time,

354
01:10:29,984 --> 01:10:33,454
we still told him.

355
01:10:33,554 --> 01:10:37,058
Maybe that's why he sat in the back.

356
01:10:37,926 --> 01:10:40,133
We shouldn't have laughed you off.

357
01:10:51,306 --> 01:10:54,287
It's okay. I can do it.

358
01:11:43,524 --> 01:11:46,027
A man came by this morning.

359
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:47,867
You were out shopping.

360
01:11:48,830 --> 01:11:51,811
I think his name's Clement.

361
01:11:51,899 --> 01:11:55,642
He was worried
about some work problems.

362
01:11:55,737 --> 01:11:57,842
His factory.

363
01:11:57,939 --> 01:12:00,818
The workers put down their machinery.

364
01:12:00,908 --> 01:12:02,979
He could go bankrupt.

365
01:12:04,245 --> 01:12:06,782
Someone wants to hurt him.

366
01:12:06,881 --> 01:12:12,058
Someone close,
someone who works with him.

367
01:12:12,153 --> 01:12:16,363
He needs to know,
or he'll lose his factory.

368
01:12:16,457 --> 01:12:18,596
He needs to open his eyes.

369
01:12:20,661 --> 01:12:22,641
He needs to do it now.

370
01:12:23,598 --> 01:12:26,977
Of course, he won't want to hear it.

371
01:12:28,369 --> 01:12:29,871
He won't believe it.

372
01:12:30,738 --> 01:12:32,877
He won't doubt those around him.

373
01:13:03,671 --> 01:13:09,246
Jesus's Theresinha
Has fallen down

374
01:13:09,343 --> 01:13:13,120
Three knights have come

375
01:13:13,214 --> 01:13:17,526
All with hat in hand

376
01:13:19,554 --> 01:13:24,264
The first is her father

377
01:13:24,358 --> 01:13:28,329
The second is her brother

378
01:14:59,387 --> 01:15:00,923
What is it?

379
01:15:01,556 --> 01:15:04,901
I know you'll always love me.

380
01:15:04,992 --> 01:15:06,403
And how do you know that?

381
01:15:06,494 --> 01:15:07,905
I just know it.

382
01:15:10,932 --> 01:15:12,969
Didn't know it before?

383
01:15:33,487 --> 01:15:36,127
I guess I should say yes.

384
01:15:36,257 --> 01:15:38,999
My first husband died 10 years ago.

385
01:15:39,327 --> 01:15:42,137
I'm 32. I have a daughter.

386
01:15:42,263 --> 01:15:46,006
We live alone. It's not always fun.

387
01:15:49,570 --> 01:15:53,780
And also, he was already married
in a church.

388
01:15:53,874 --> 01:15:57,151
And I married my husband, who died.

389
01:15:57,245 --> 01:16:02,820
If I remarry,
who will be my real husband?

390
01:16:07,488 --> 01:16:10,298
This is all I can give you.

391
01:16:14,862 --> 01:16:18,105
I want to know
if I'm making a mistake.

392
01:17:13,052 --> 01:17:16,329
- Don't look at me like that.
- Sorry.

393
01:17:19,625 --> 01:17:21,070
I just want to say...

394
01:17:21,828 --> 01:17:23,637
I want to tell you...

395
01:17:32,238 --> 01:17:33,478
What?

396
01:17:37,210 --> 01:17:40,020
We can do something for you.

397
01:17:40,112 --> 01:17:41,955
For my appearance, is that it?

398
01:17:49,355 --> 01:17:51,460
I don't know what I want yet.

399
01:17:51,591 --> 01:17:54,629
I think I'll just stay this way.

400
01:17:54,727 --> 01:17:58,573
I don't want to do anything.
I'll see.

401
01:18:01,167 --> 01:18:03,169
I can't see myself, anyway.

402
01:18:04,971 --> 01:18:06,780
So I don't care.

403
01:18:14,413 --> 01:18:16,518
You received a lot of letters.

404
01:18:20,853 --> 01:18:22,799
I read some of them.

405
01:18:26,158 --> 01:18:28,035
They're beautiful.

406
01:18:35,968 --> 01:18:37,948
I'm a simple man.

407
01:18:38,037 --> 01:18:41,883
I don't expect to understand.
Some things are beyond me.

408
01:18:44,143 --> 01:18:46,487
If others are interested, why not?

409
01:18:48,648 --> 01:18:52,994
If you have a gift, you have to give.

410
01:18:54,854 --> 01:18:58,961
I don't know what's going on,
but my daughter is happy with you.

411
01:18:59,091 --> 01:19:03,767
I'm glad to see her that way.

412
01:19:16,375 --> 01:19:19,322
- What's Anna like?
- She's my daughter.

413
01:19:20,613 --> 01:19:22,650
My own daughter.

414
01:19:22,748 --> 01:19:24,659
I'm nothing. It's her.

415
01:19:24,750 --> 01:19:26,525
Me...

416
01:19:26,619 --> 01:19:28,860
All I want...

417
01:19:28,955 --> 01:19:33,995
Don't speak about me. Nothing.

418
01:19:34,093 --> 01:19:36,266
I don't want to know.

419
01:19:36,362 --> 01:19:40,606
Not if I die,
not if I win the lottery.

420
01:19:53,446 --> 01:19:55,653
I want peace.

421
01:20:01,654 --> 01:20:03,224
I don't understand.

422
01:20:04,557 --> 01:20:07,128
Help me.

423
01:20:08,327 --> 01:20:10,933
Why do I have this?

424
01:20:12,431 --> 01:20:18,404
Tell me. I'm ready to hear.

425
01:20:19,472 --> 01:20:23,477
I don't know.

426
01:20:24,777 --> 01:20:29,624
But if you have a gift,
you have to give.

427
01:20:37,490 --> 01:20:38,468
Here.

428
01:20:38,557 --> 01:20:40,230
Thank you.

429
01:21:34,747 --> 01:21:37,626
You have something
more beautiful than money.

430
01:21:38,617 --> 01:21:40,358
More beautiful than yourselves.

431
01:21:41,253 --> 01:21:43,096
It's a big chance.

432
01:21:45,091 --> 01:21:46,661
There's a statue.

433
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:49,801
It protects you.

434
01:21:51,130 --> 01:21:52,768
I see water.

435
01:21:54,633 --> 01:21:56,977
You'll be healed there.

436
01:21:57,069 --> 01:21:59,675
You don't know you're sick.

437
01:22:01,307 --> 01:22:02,752
Lots of water.

438
01:22:04,877 --> 01:22:07,289
It might be autumn.

439
01:22:07,413 --> 01:22:09,324
The leaves aren't the same.

440
01:22:10,683 --> 01:22:13,129
Someone will be unhappy.

441
01:22:13,219 --> 01:22:16,393
He'll be the strongest in the end.

442
01:22:19,859 --> 01:22:21,497
Dear Edu:

443
01:22:21,594 --> 01:22:26,634
I couldn't send news.
I don't know what to say.

444
01:22:26,732 --> 01:22:31,579
I don't know where I am.
But I'm safe here.

445
01:22:31,670 --> 01:22:34,844
I'm living with a young girl
named Anna.

446
01:22:34,940 --> 01:22:37,648
She takes care of me.

447
01:22:37,743 --> 01:22:41,054
I don't know why. But she's a gift.

448
01:22:42,148 --> 01:22:46,961
Since I lost my eyesight,
I have no idea what she looks like.

449
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:49,697
The only thing I know

450
01:22:49,789 --> 01:22:53,669
is that you and I will probably
never see each other again.

451
01:22:54,260 --> 01:22:57,935
Don't make this a drama.

452
01:22:58,030 --> 01:23:03,207
I'll never see anyone again.
And I wish no one could see me.

453
01:23:04,904 --> 01:23:06,383
What was my life?

454
01:23:07,173 --> 01:23:09,380
It has changed violently.

455
01:23:10,476 --> 01:23:12,820
But I'm happy sometimes.

456
01:23:12,912 --> 01:23:16,291
I speak about
the beautiful things I see.

457
01:23:17,016 --> 01:23:20,361
I remember you were very beautiful,
too, my little brother:

458
01:23:21,620 --> 01:23:26,035
Don't worry about me.
Nothing is in our hands anymore.

459
01:23:26,125 --> 01:23:28,298
Tiresia.

460
01:23:28,661 --> 01:23:30,504
Anna?

461
01:23:58,490 --> 01:24:00,697
Anna, I can't find the chair.

462
01:24:19,478 --> 01:24:20,980
Anna, where are you?

463
01:24:46,438 --> 01:24:48,008
I saw Anna.

464
01:24:48,140 --> 01:24:51,485
She was with boys her own age.
They seemed nice.

465
01:24:54,546 --> 01:24:55,923
It's a nice age.

466
01:24:56,048 --> 01:25:00,258
My son's age.
I have a 16-year-old son.

467
01:25:02,288 --> 01:25:06,566
I'd like to see him hanging out
with boys his own age.

468
01:25:08,127 --> 01:25:10,573
But my son doesn't do anything.

469
01:25:11,363 --> 01:25:15,004
All day in his room, doesn't speak.

470
01:25:16,035 --> 01:25:19,812
When I speak, he doesn't respond.

471
01:25:20,906 --> 01:25:22,886
For the past two months.

472
01:25:22,975 --> 01:25:25,581
I don't know what to do.

473
01:25:27,813 --> 01:25:30,123
I drove a long way to get here.

474
01:25:31,684 --> 01:25:32,890
Yes, I know.

475
01:25:41,226 --> 01:25:43,934
What do you think I should do?

476
01:25:44,029 --> 01:25:47,602
What I think isn't important.
I only translate.

477
01:25:47,700 --> 01:25:49,646
Then translate me.

478
01:25:52,237 --> 01:25:55,946
My wife can't sleep.
I don't know what to do.

479
01:25:59,044 --> 01:26:01,490
Speak. Tell me something.

480
01:26:03,315 --> 01:26:05,317
I came for my son.

481
01:26:05,851 --> 01:26:09,298
He says nothing, does nothing.
He won't go to school.

482
01:26:09,421 --> 01:26:13,062
He won't see his girlfriend,
stays in his room.

483
01:26:13,158 --> 01:26:14,796
So I'll tell you.

484
01:26:15,461 --> 01:26:19,204
A real drama awaits you back home.

485
01:26:20,299 --> 01:26:21,642
Your son is dead.

486
01:26:21,734 --> 01:26:25,375
He threw himself out the window.

487
01:26:25,471 --> 01:26:29,214
I didn't want to tell you.

488
01:26:30,809 --> 01:26:33,312
I accept my destiny.

489
01:26:33,412 --> 01:26:36,222
You must accept yours.

490
01:26:37,216 --> 01:26:40,129
My God, you're a monster.

491
01:26:40,219 --> 01:26:42,790
You're the devil.

492
01:26:42,888 --> 01:26:44,424
You're a whore.

493
01:28:23,722 --> 01:28:26,362
Clement is waiting at the door.

494
01:28:26,725 --> 01:28:28,864
Because he lost his factory.

495
01:29:05,264 --> 01:29:08,609
Dear Tiresia, the prophet.

496
01:29:08,700 --> 01:29:11,306
Others suffer and seek salvation.

497
01:29:11,403 --> 01:29:15,476
How I would like to be you.
You seek what's beyond destiny.

498
01:29:54,346 --> 01:29:58,294
No need to worry.
There's no prophet, no oracle.

499
01:29:58,383 --> 01:30:01,830
Just local legend, rumors.

500
01:30:04,590 --> 01:30:07,571
This isn't about prophecy,
but miracle.

501
01:30:07,659 --> 01:30:09,605
A miracle?

502
01:30:09,695 --> 01:30:12,471
That man who has leukemia...

503
01:30:12,564 --> 01:30:13,634
Simon?

504
01:30:13,732 --> 01:30:18,681
Two weeks ago, he saw Tiresia.
He told him he would be healed.

505
01:30:18,770 --> 01:30:21,546
- And he was?
- Yes.

506
01:31:04,815 --> 01:31:06,158
Anna?

507
01:31:06,283 --> 01:31:09,287
Am I disturbing you?

508
01:31:09,387 --> 01:31:10,798
Anna.

509
01:31:21,966 --> 01:31:25,072
Anna, please leave us.

510
01:31:28,606 --> 01:31:30,483
I want you to go out.

511
01:31:50,294 --> 01:31:51,705
My name's Francois.

512
01:31:52,863 --> 01:31:54,570
I've heard a lot about you.

513
01:32:00,504 --> 01:32:02,211
People care for you?

514
01:32:02,940 --> 01:32:06,319
I ask for nothing.
They give me things.

515
01:32:07,445 --> 01:32:09,391
They help because I can't work.

516
01:32:13,084 --> 01:32:15,030
It's nice of them.

517
01:32:19,457 --> 01:32:21,459
When they come, you speak to them?

518
01:32:22,359 --> 01:32:25,135
We talk, that's all.

519
01:32:27,164 --> 01:32:29,440
I think I need to see you, too.

520
01:32:30,234 --> 01:32:32,180
No one needs to see me.

521
01:32:32,269 --> 01:32:34,840
People come, that's how it is.

522
01:32:38,409 --> 01:32:41,049
I'd like to know
what you see about me.

523
01:32:43,647 --> 01:32:45,388
I can't see anything.

524
01:32:55,926 --> 01:32:57,371
Goodbye.

525
01:32:59,130 --> 01:33:00,837
Father?

526
01:33:03,968 --> 01:33:05,914
How did you know I was a priest?

527
01:33:07,538 --> 01:33:09,779
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

528
01:33:15,045 --> 01:33:18,151
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

529
01:33:18,949 --> 01:33:21,327
I'm sorry.
I can't take your confession.

530
01:35:01,018 --> 01:35:02,622
I know it's a sin.

531
01:35:02,753 --> 01:35:05,029
Roses aren't God's invention.

532
01:35:05,155 --> 01:35:08,193
Man took what God created
and transformed them.

533
01:35:08,792 --> 01:35:11,636
I thank God that I'm here today.

534
01:35:11,762 --> 01:35:14,072
And not when roses didn't exist.

535
01:35:58,342 --> 01:35:59,514
It's wine.

536
01:35:59,810 --> 01:36:01,084
Thank you.

537
01:36:04,181 --> 01:36:06,787
I couldn't come empty-handed.

538
01:36:10,387 --> 01:36:12,367
Can I ask you something?

539
01:36:12,756 --> 01:36:14,463
Yes.

540
01:36:14,558 --> 01:36:16,799
How long have you been blind?

541
01:36:19,296 --> 01:36:21,367
I had an accident a while back.

542
01:36:22,232 --> 01:36:24,109
I'm sorry.

543
01:36:25,736 --> 01:36:27,443
What happened?

544
01:36:28,539 --> 01:36:30,280
I can't remember.

545
01:36:31,275 --> 01:36:34,313
You can't, or you don't want to say?

546
01:36:34,411 --> 01:36:36,084
I can't remember.

547
01:36:37,081 --> 01:36:38,560
Do you suffer?

548
01:36:41,385 --> 01:36:44,696
We get used to everything.
So I got used to this, too.

549
01:36:45,189 --> 01:36:48,727
I'm well cared for here.
I was taken in.

550
01:36:49,426 --> 01:36:53,431
People try to give me
the best life possible.

551
01:36:54,598 --> 01:36:57,374
You say you see things?

552
01:36:57,468 --> 01:36:59,448
Things which will happen?

553
01:36:59,536 --> 01:37:02,983
Those things happen.
But I don't make miracles.

554
01:37:03,073 --> 01:37:04,381
All right.

555
01:37:04,475 --> 01:37:06,682
Tell them I don't do miracles.

556
01:37:06,777 --> 01:37:08,120
I'll tell them.

557
01:37:08,679 --> 01:37:10,454
You must.

558
01:37:12,082 --> 01:37:13,425
What do you see?

559
01:37:14,785 --> 01:37:16,423
What does an oracle see?

560
01:37:16,787 --> 01:37:18,767
A sentence comes, that's all.

561
01:37:23,961 --> 01:37:25,838
And then what?

562
01:37:29,233 --> 01:37:30,735
Then I speak it.

563
01:37:35,072 --> 01:37:37,575
Does it come in a precise way?

564
01:37:41,545 --> 01:37:43,525
I don't understand.

565
01:37:44,982 --> 01:37:47,019
Do you decide anything?

566
01:37:49,019 --> 01:37:52,057
When it comes?
Who should hear it?

567
01:37:54,358 --> 01:37:55,735
I don't know.

568
01:37:56,393 --> 01:37:58,771
People are there. Words come.

569
01:37:58,896 --> 01:38:00,466
I speak.

570
01:38:01,398 --> 01:38:03,639
Do you understand the words?

571
01:38:13,544 --> 01:38:15,387
No need to be afraid.

572
01:38:16,747 --> 01:38:18,317
I'm not afraid.

573
01:38:47,044 --> 01:38:49,285
You remind me of a painting I own.

574
01:38:53,817 --> 01:38:56,024
A woman seated on a sofa.

575
01:38:56,820 --> 01:38:59,801
She stands out.
The sofa and wall are uni-colored.

576
01:39:00,757 --> 01:39:05,638
She wears a black dress.
Her black hair is in a bun.

577
01:39:05,729 --> 01:39:09,404
Fine features, thin neck and wrists.

578
01:39:09,500 --> 01:39:13,380
Hands folded, she's leaning.

579
01:39:13,470 --> 01:39:16,883
Her pose is somewhat twisted.

580
01:39:16,974 --> 01:39:19,853
Her face is long and slightly odd.

581
01:39:19,943 --> 01:39:22,685
Can't tell if she's smiling
or judging.

582
01:39:24,248 --> 01:39:28,025
Maybe just an unimportant scene
from a salon. Maybe not.

583
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:32,990
An impression she sees
something that we don't.

584
01:39:33,090 --> 01:39:34,660
Like she's mocking.

585
01:39:36,493 --> 01:39:40,236
Maybe just cynical or disillusioned.

586
01:39:40,330 --> 01:39:43,504
I'm nothing like that woman.

587
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:47,343
I had an accident.
I lost my sight.

588
01:39:47,471 --> 01:39:49,041
I was taken in.

589
01:39:50,107 --> 01:39:54,283
I'm fine here.
Safe and well cared for.

590
01:39:54,411 --> 01:39:55,754
That's all.

591
01:39:55,846 --> 01:39:57,883
No, there's something else.

592
01:39:58,015 --> 01:39:59,926
I don't know.

593
01:40:00,017 --> 01:40:02,793
Let's say I can't lie.

594
01:40:02,886 --> 01:40:05,924
Even if telling the truth
is difficult.

595
01:40:06,023 --> 01:40:09,061
How do you know you tell the truth?

596
01:40:09,159 --> 01:40:12,697
I just know, that's all.

597
01:40:21,772 --> 01:40:24,309
- Letters from locals?
- Yes.

598
01:40:24,408 --> 01:40:26,251
May I?

599
01:40:26,343 --> 01:40:28,084
Go on.

600
01:40:40,791 --> 01:40:42,361
You don't open them.

601
01:40:42,893 --> 01:40:47,069
As I said, I don't decide.

602
01:40:51,001 --> 01:40:53,504
Precisely. Here's something.

603
01:40:53,604 --> 01:40:55,982
A short poem by Omar Khayyam.

604
01:40:58,141 --> 01:40:59,518
I'll read it to you.

605
01:40:59,610 --> 01:41:02,853
The blind considered Khayyam
to be wise and intelligent.

606
01:41:05,415 --> 01:41:11,366
"The circle we cross reveals not,
neither beginning nor end.

607
01:41:11,455 --> 01:41:13,696
Nothing pronounces the truth:

608
01:41:13,790 --> 01:41:16,464
From where we come is where we go.

609
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:19,666
The Master created all things,

610
01:41:19,763 --> 01:41:22,266
but why condemn them
to imperfection?

611
01:41:22,366 --> 01:41:22,431
If their images prove ugly,
whose fault is it?

612
01:41:22,432 --> 01:41:27,074
If their images prove ugly,
whose fault is it?

613
01:41:27,170 --> 01:41:31,016
And if beautiful,
why seek their ruin?"

614
01:41:31,107 --> 01:41:36,022
You know,
I'm just a whore from Brazil.

615
01:41:36,112 --> 01:41:40,026
I don't understand all you say.

616
01:41:40,116 --> 01:41:43,290
That's why I mentioned my painting.

617
01:41:43,953 --> 01:41:48,095
One can't be above things
and want to transform them.

618
01:41:48,191 --> 01:41:50,262
Let things be as written.

619
01:41:50,359 --> 01:41:53,602
I was transformed. I didn't choose.

620
01:41:53,696 --> 01:41:55,300
That's different.

621
01:41:56,999 --> 01:41:59,445
But you still made a choice.

622
01:41:59,535 --> 01:42:01,481
I'm not sure.

623
01:42:04,974 --> 01:42:08,319
Do you suffer from your physique?

624
01:42:09,312 --> 01:42:11,053
That's unimportant.

625
01:42:11,147 --> 01:42:13,093
Not true. That can't be said.

626
01:42:13,182 --> 01:42:15,321
I'm talking about me.

627
01:42:15,418 --> 01:42:17,898
I was from the favela slums.

628
01:42:17,987 --> 01:42:21,696
I always knew my life
would be different from other boys.

629
01:42:21,791 --> 01:42:25,500
But I didn't choose, not even that.

630
01:42:25,595 --> 01:42:27,438
It was there.

631
01:42:29,065 --> 01:42:31,477
It took a lot of work.

632
01:42:31,567 --> 01:42:33,478
It was my own war.

633
01:42:34,670 --> 01:42:39,483
I became a woman, then a whore.

634
01:42:39,575 --> 01:42:44,251
Little boys who become women,
they become whores.

635
01:42:46,182 --> 01:42:48,458
Then a man tore out my eyes.

636
01:42:50,186 --> 01:42:51,824
Now I have a gift.

637
01:42:52,889 --> 01:42:55,267
So I give.

638
01:42:55,358 --> 01:42:57,736
I don't see the wrong in that.

639
01:42:57,827 --> 01:43:03,436
All of you look at me,
thinking it's more, it's a great joy.

640
01:43:03,533 --> 01:43:07,948
But it's a celebration in despair.
No one sees that.

641
01:43:08,037 --> 01:43:10,381
I can't decide.

642
01:43:10,473 --> 01:43:14,546
That's how it is. I decide nothing.

643
01:43:14,644 --> 01:43:18,023
I told you, I decide nothing.

644
01:43:18,114 --> 01:43:21,095
I'm just like that.

645
01:43:21,183 --> 01:43:23,663
Nothing I can do about it.

646
01:43:25,421 --> 01:43:27,731
I live with that. I accept it.

647
01:43:27,823 --> 01:43:30,565
I feel something, then I speak it.

648
01:43:31,294 --> 01:43:33,501
The truth is a force.

649
01:43:35,331 --> 01:43:38,710
I told you, my life changed violently.

650
01:43:40,236 --> 01:43:42,341
Sometimes, I feel happy.

651
01:43:50,212 --> 01:43:52,749
They trust me with the trivial.

652
01:43:55,217 --> 01:43:57,788
They trust Tiresia with their souls.

653
01:44:01,991 --> 01:44:04,972
A horrible night which seems endless.

654
01:44:05,061 --> 01:44:07,268
A real priest is never liked.

655
01:44:07,363 --> 01:44:09,502
I believe people like me enough.

656
01:44:14,971 --> 01:44:18,282
Tiresia said my pride
would soon pass.

657
01:44:18,374 --> 01:44:21,787
That what I thought was an ulcer
was only temporary.

658
01:44:21,877 --> 01:44:24,050
But I would have a dental problem.

659
01:44:31,687 --> 01:44:33,428
I feel lost.

660
01:44:33,522 --> 01:44:35,729
I don't understand it all.

661
01:44:35,825 --> 01:44:37,236
I just take it.

662
01:44:37,627 --> 01:44:42,201
Now I see separate things
seem to be connected.

663
01:45:52,935 --> 01:45:54,778
Who did you go out with last night?

664
01:45:54,870 --> 01:45:56,440
Yesterday?
The guy with the Mercedes?

665
01:45:56,539 --> 01:45:59,315
I think I saw him somewhere before.

666
01:45:59,408 --> 01:46:01,012
He made out with Vivi, right?

667
01:46:01,110 --> 01:46:03,852
Yes. Because he's been my client
for a long time.

668
01:46:05,781 --> 01:46:09,024
- Oh, Vivi! Big Vivi!
- Oh, yeah. She told me.

669
01:46:09,118 --> 01:46:10,119
Big Vivi.

670
01:46:10,219 --> 01:46:13,928
Oh, yeah. She's got a huge dick.
It's like a child's arm.

671
01:46:14,023 --> 01:46:15,058
A child's arm!

672
01:46:15,157 --> 01:46:16,363
But I don't know what went wrong,

673
01:46:16,459 --> 01:46:19,838
because yesterday, he wanted me
to go with him, and I did.

674
01:46:19,929 --> 01:46:22,671
You need to take it easy.

675
01:46:24,133 --> 01:46:26,545
Why fight in the street?

676
01:46:28,938 --> 01:46:31,248
Don't be so touchy.

677
01:46:31,340 --> 01:46:33,445
You don't have papers.

678
01:46:33,542 --> 01:46:35,419
You need to be discreet.

679
01:46:39,749 --> 01:46:41,456
I talked to Mom.

680
01:46:42,551 --> 01:46:45,361
They're preparing Arsenio's departure.

681
01:46:46,222 --> 01:46:48,395
They send you a kiss.

682
01:46:57,266 --> 01:46:59,405
You should call her.

683
01:46:59,502 --> 01:47:02,847
She says you never call.

684
01:47:02,938 --> 01:47:04,815
You listening, mule?

685
01:47:04,907 --> 01:47:08,116
I'm listening, Edu.

686
01:47:36,539 --> 01:47:37,609
Thanks.

687
01:48:18,280 --> 01:48:19,953
Don't you want to have sex?

688
01:48:20,049 --> 01:48:20,891
No.

689
01:48:22,585 --> 01:48:24,189
I'm a whore.

690
01:48:25,855 --> 01:48:27,664
I don't believe so.

691
01:48:27,756 --> 01:48:30,168
Yes, I'm a whore.

692
01:48:30,259 --> 01:48:34,036
I'll undress. We'll have sex.

693
01:48:34,129 --> 01:48:35,267
All right?

694
01:48:38,934 --> 01:48:39,969
Come here.

695
01:48:44,240 --> 01:48:46,743
More beautiful than the others?

696
01:48:47,710 --> 01:48:48,711
Yes.

697
01:48:49,044 --> 01:48:51,081
Your skin is soft again.

698
01:48:53,983 --> 01:48:56,327
My hands are too big.

699
01:48:56,418 --> 01:48:58,625
I don't think so.

700
01:48:58,721 --> 01:49:00,291
They are.

701
01:49:00,389 --> 01:49:02,130
Show me.

702
01:49:08,197 --> 01:49:09,870
They're beautiful.

703
01:49:11,033 --> 01:49:13,035
Small hands are vulgar.

704
01:49:17,740 --> 01:49:19,879
But I have a penis.

705
01:49:19,975 --> 01:49:21,045
I know.

706
01:49:21,410 --> 01:49:24,323
- You like my faults?
- Yes.

707
01:49:24,413 --> 01:49:26,256
Even up close?

708
01:49:26,348 --> 01:49:27,622
Even up close.

709
01:49:29,151 --> 01:49:30,858
So you love me?

710
01:49:30,953 --> 01:49:32,296
Yes, I love you.

711
01:49:36,558 --> 01:49:39,164
Please, let me go.

712
01:49:45,267 --> 01:49:46,746
Please.

713
01:49:46,835 --> 01:49:48,678
It hurts.

714
01:49:48,771 --> 01:49:50,751
I'm scared.

715
01:49:54,243 --> 01:49:55,779
Mom.

716
01:49:57,846 --> 01:50:00,918
I don't want to go back.
I don't want to go back.

717
01:50:02,952 --> 01:50:05,125
Why did this happen?

718
01:50:05,220 --> 01:50:08,827
Mary, I want to feel
your hand in mine.

719
01:50:08,924 --> 01:50:10,267
It's inside.

720
01:50:10,359 --> 01:50:13,033
Inside me.

721
01:50:15,230 --> 01:50:19,474
I can hear. I can hear. I'm alive.

722
01:50:19,568 --> 01:50:22,242
Anna will be the mother of Christ.

723
01:51:08,217 --> 01:51:11,858
There's no beginning, no end.
No witness.

724
01:51:11,954 --> 01:51:14,935
We're just a part
of things that go on.

725
01:51:20,262 --> 01:51:21,332
Thank you.

726
01:51:54,930 --> 01:51:56,773
It opens here.

727
01:51:57,366 --> 01:51:59,846
See what's there. The key...

728
01:51:59,968 --> 01:52:02,915
Put the key in and turn.

729
01:52:03,005 --> 01:52:04,951
It opens.

730
01:52:05,040 --> 01:52:09,546
Like that.

731
01:52:11,480 --> 01:52:19,422
Break it, and it will fall.

732
01:52:23,525 --> 01:52:24,765
Open.

733
01:52:24,860 --> 01:52:26,305
Open.

734
01:52:29,565 --> 01:52:31,772
The cross, I'm putting it down.

735
01:52:31,867 --> 01:52:35,280
And I open.

736
01:52:37,573 --> 01:52:39,484
They fell.

737
01:52:43,278 --> 01:52:45,451
They fell.

738
01:53:09,938 --> 01:53:11,440
And then...

739
01:53:13,508 --> 01:53:14,953
That.

740
01:53:18,680 --> 01:53:25,154
Okay, I don't know if--
What? I do that?
