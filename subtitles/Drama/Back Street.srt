1
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:23,087
THE USURPADORA

2
00:00:55,370 --> 00:01:00,285
CINCINNATI In the old and good
times before the 18th amendment.

3
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,362
Open the door and there she is.

4
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:14,160
I know I earned it, Ray.

5
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,766
For you, Ray.

6
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:23,883
You are awesome.

7
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,088
You are very curious.

8
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:12,561
You give one the whole rope
of the world...

9
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:16,201
And the first thing you do
all is to be hanged.

10
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,562
Come on, Ray.

11
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:25,324
We had lots of fun.
What do you say?

12
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:27,285
Fact.

13
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:31,407
That's great.
We're going to do something.

14
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,562
I know a small hotel
in this street...

15
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,329
Let's Dance.

16
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,928
- Hi, Ray.
- Hello!

17
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,406
- How are you?
- Very good.

18
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:02,401
- What are you doing here?
- I came in case I saw you.

19
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:08,245
Who is it?

20
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:12,922
Ray Schmidt, the girl
Most cheerful of the city.

21
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:14,170
It seems.

22
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:15,803
What do you say?

23
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:20,409
I've been saying no
since before I met you...

24
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,481
and that's five years ago.

25
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,408
He thinks you very smart, does not he?

26
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:28,243
With the travelers he does not
Missing list

27
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,407
I see you come a kilometer.

28
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:34,883
All right, listen to this.

29
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:46,489
Ray, what's wrong with you?
It was just a joke.

30
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:50,963
I love it too.
Let's stop joking.

31
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:05,202
- But, mam...
- I said no!

32
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:09,523
You will not go out alone at night
with a man.

33
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:13,208
Next to the Rhine is not a place
for decent girls.

34
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:14,929
You let Ray go.

35
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:19,083
Ray Schmidt is not my daughter,
but my stepdaughter.

36
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:22,488
So I do not have
authority over it.

37
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:24,528
They are very serious words.

38
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,881
So that's true.

39
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:30,083
If Ray Schmidt were my daughter...

40
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:34,209
I would not walk around
at night like a top.

41
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:35,679
Why not?

42
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:38,200
He works a lot in the store,
and at night...

43
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:42,443
At night it would be better
at home with your family...

44
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:46,803
and not tossed around
going out with some and with others.

45
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:51,529
But to the girls of today
They do not like being at home.

46
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:54,929
These young people are lost.

47
00:04:55,890 --> 00:05:00,406
It is always said that
young people are lost.

48
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:06,048
But in the end,
they always manage to save themselves.

49
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:08,526
- Hello everyone.
- Hi, Kurt.

50
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:16,879
Is this Ray?

51
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:20,368
He has not returned yet.
He went to "Next to the Rhine".

52
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:26,280
- Are you still engaged in that madness?
- Oh, burn?

53
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:30,325
Kurt, I thought you were
an intelligent boy.

54
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:31,764
Autom viles!

55
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:34,604
Within five years
there will be no trace.

56
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:35,925
Do you believe?

57
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,122
There's a guy in Detroit
that makes them dozens.

58
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:40,690
- What's his name?
- Henry Ford.

59
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,119
Not the slightest idea.

60
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:46,204
- Well, he has almost won half a million.
- Half a million?

61
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:49,165
It's the funniest thing I've ever heard.

62
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:52,090
Cr ame, I would buy a
dealer of yours...

63
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:55,318
even if I had to sell my store.

64
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:58,164
Keep your store
and invest in horses.

65
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:59,564
Autom viles!

66
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:02,125
Dirty and smelly pots!

67
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:05,442
If that's why, the horses
They do not smell like flowers either.

68
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:09,119
"Kurt Schendler, do not be obscene!"

69
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,001
- Good evening, Bob.
- Adi s.

70
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:27,605
- Ah, Ray arrives.
- Good evening, daddy.

71
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:31,242
- Hello Darling.
- Good evening, Kurt.

72
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:34,966
- You went to "Along the Rhine"?
- Yes, I did not stop dancing.

73
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,365
You will be tired.

74
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,208
Ray, I was waiting for you.

75
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:42,010
- S? For what?
- I wanted to ask you...

76
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,925
You would mind coming tomorrow
to the store...

77
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,642
to help me with the books?

78
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,208
Of course not, I'll be delighted.

79
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,879
- They're done a mess.
- As usual.

80
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:55,929
I read that a girl of Indiana...

81
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:58,240
went to a bicycle shop...

82
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:01,562
and they found her dead
two weeks later...

83
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:04,160
with his head in a sack
of burlap.

84
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:09,604
You do not know,
but I'm going to bed.

85
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:12,918
Come on, Frida.

86
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,050
Mam, why do I have
to lie down so soon?

87
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:19,367
They say you can do that
a boy marry if...

88
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:23,042
Go to your room.
You are incorrigible.

89
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,527
It would be better if I left
to sleep.

90
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:30,968
There's nothing like a good night's sleep
to feel like new.

91
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:35,445
- Goodnight.
- Ray, will we see you tomorrow?

92
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:38,040
- Of course I do.
- Goodnight.

93
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:43,801
Simptic, right?

94
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:48,525
- Same as t.
- I, a great boy?

95
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:50,164
Of course.

96
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:54,205
Not anymore, honey.
I start going down.

97
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:59,488
Pap! Do not say that.

98
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,528
You are the most boy
young I know.

99
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:11,324
Ray, it does not seem bad to me that you
dream with something better than Kurt.

100
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:14,920
But maybe life
bring you something worse.

101
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:17,041
Kurt is a good boy.

102
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,083
Maybe it will never surprise you.

103
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,649
But it's almost better.

104
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:26,521
Most marriages
they end up giving many surprises.

105
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:51,083
Ray, come!
I want to teach you one thing!

106
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:53,119
Why is it beautiful?

107
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:58,522
- What's a wonder?
- It's fabulous!

108
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:11,361
I will finish it as soon as
receive a piece tomorrow.

109
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:15,765
- Will you accompany me to look for her?
- When I finish with the books.

110
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:18,763
You are charming, helping me
Sundays with books.

111
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:23,683
I do not even want to think
in how they would be if not!

112
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:30,045
- What happened?
- I've turned it off.

113
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:32,850
Ray...

114
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:35,161
Do you have confidence in me?

115
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:39,128
Of course I do.
You will be an important man.

116
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:40,479
I'm sure.

117
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,647
I'm glad to hear you say that,
why...

118
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:46,122
Ray, do you want to marry me?

119
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:53,563
Well, I...

120
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:56,648
I do not think it's
so funny. I...

121
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:01,085
I do not laugh at you, Kurt.
I just thought.

122
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:06,366
You are the first man
who asks me in marriage.

123
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,959
I'm the only one
that has had value.

124
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:13,689
Many have value.

125
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:16,803
They think they can have me
without marrying me.

126
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,119
What do they know?

127
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,008
Only because you're happy...

128
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:23,641
That they dare
to procrastinate with me!

129
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:29,530
Ray.

130
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,442
It's not like that, is it?

131
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:35,887
- What?
- That they can have you without...

132
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,968
I already knew!

133
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:55,963
Pap has gone up.

134
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:03,766
Ray, you have not answered
to my question.

135
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:06,166
- What question?
- Do you want to marry me?

136
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:10,119
- Kurt, you're great.
- But...

137
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:12,678
But you do not love me.

138
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:14,449
So, no.

139
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:17,247
It would be horrible to get married
with you...

140
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:19,481
and one day discover
who wanted another.

141
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:25,404
I know myself very well.
With me, it's all or nothing.

142
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:29,448
God assist man
I fell in love with.

143
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:33,924
Until you find it
will not accept a no.

144
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:36,648
I will continue asking for it.

145
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:39,964
It seems reasonable to me.

146
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:01,682
- Hello, Ray!
- Hello!

147
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:03,923
- How are you?
- Greatly.

148
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:07,208
- Do you know Kurt Shendler?
- Hello.

149
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:10,084
Do you mind waiting?
I'm going to the slogan.

150
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:11,929
- Sure, Kurt.
- See you soon.

151
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:15,561
- Are you going to take that train?
- Unfortunately.

152
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:19,167
- I have not seen you much this trip.
- And who is to blame?

153
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:21,446
What a way to treat me.

154
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:25,080
I learn to love you,
and then you leave me abandoned.

155
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:28,044
Do not start, do not start!

156
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:33,888
Ray, I'm going to take the train to
Detroit. Are you coming with me?

157
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:37,126
I would love it, but I can not.

158
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:40,601
- Why?
- I forgot the toothbrush.

159
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:45,327
You are always the same!
You baffle me.

160
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:49,483
I think you're a fraud.

161
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:54,162
But the next time it comes
You will not escape so easily.

162
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:55,479
We'll see.

163
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:57,846
- Hello, Walter.
- Bakeless, what's up?

164
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:02,003
- What are you doing here?
- As usual. Go and come.

165
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:03,650
- How is the bank going?
- All right.

166
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:06,160
- And the textiles?
- Fatal.

167
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:09,169
- Adi s, Ray.
- Adi s.

168
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:13,604
Oh, Walter. I introduce you to
a friend, Ray Schmidt.

169
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:20,010
Charmed.

170
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:26,770
- What do you think?
- I'm telling you?

171
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,842
I'll say it sooner or later.

172
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:32,486
I thought it is the day
more perfect than I've seen.

173
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,603
Are you crazy?

174
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:38,089
It makes embarrassment, and threatens
rain since this morning.

175
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:42,648
You are crazy The sky is
clear and the air is intoxicating.

176
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:45,441
God in heaven and you on earth.

177
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:49,046
It will make me red.

178
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:52,128
It is already
and it feels very good.

179
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:54,490
Come on?

180
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:04,245
- I have not heard his name.
- Does it matter?

181
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:05,839
Not especially.

182
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:15,842
- I'm taking her?
- I already have a car, thanks.

183
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:18,282
It seems to have everything.

184
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:25,562
Your car.

185
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:27,604
Not rush.

186
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:30,410
When are we ever seeing each other again?

187
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:38,203
Tonight at 10.
11th street corner with Adams.

188
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:42,088
- I have an appointment.
- An lela.

189
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:26,282
- Hello.
- What's up?

190
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,808
He does not seem surprised
of seeing me.

191
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:31,888
- I'm not.
- What do you think?

192
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:33,967
Are you very sure of himself.

193
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:35,525
Thus.

194
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:38,808
But if you want something very much,
It ends up becoming reality.

195
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:42,679
- Let's go a little?
- All right.

196
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:47,120
- What's his name?
- Ray.

197
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:51,046
- Oh, I'm glad.
- Are you happy? Why?

198
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:54,049
The names must be
appropriate for people.

199
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:57,203
Ray: Sunbeam, ray of joy...

200
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:59,003
ray of my heart.

201
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:01,603
Tell me, what do you do?

202
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:04,888
Work in the haberdashery
of my father.

203
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:07,760
How did he meet the guy
What did we introduce?

204
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:09,359
Bakeless?

205
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:13,210
He is a simple traveler trade.

206
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:16,840
- Now it's up to you.
- Breathe deeply.

207
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:18,490
Ahead.

208
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,009
- What's his name?
- Walter Saxel.

209
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:24,165
It is also beautiful.
Where do you live?

210
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:26,526
In Hamilton, I have come
to see the Tower.

211
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:31,249
- Do you know them?
- I know Corinne Tower.

212
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:33,202
Blonde, with blue eyes.

213
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:35,238
How did you meet her?

214
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:39,085
I've known her for a long time.
We are promised.

215
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:42,804
What luck is mine!

216
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:47,479
If I know a nice man
He is always promised.

217
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:50,842
Does he think of me?

218
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:55,409
It's raining.

219
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:59,607
It is completely right.
Let's go in there.

220
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:11,210
- Hello, Walter.
- What's up?

221
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:13,004
I'm glad to see you.

222
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,081
- When did you arrive?
- This morning.

223
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:17,326
- And your mother?
- All right. Come tomorrow.

224
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,128
- And Corinne?
- Very well thanks.

225
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:21,202
I'll be nervous about the wedding.

226
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:24,806
- It's in a week.
- Yes, that's it.

227
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,489
Are you waiting for Corinne?

228
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:29,409
In fact,
I was waiting for a taxi.

229
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:33,603
- Nice to see you.
- We'll call you.

230
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:37,605
- Say hello to Corinne.
- He will, good night.

231
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:00,647
- What are you doing, playing hide-and-seek?
- You're t!

232
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:03,564
I was grabbing to some friends.

233
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,647
- Who?
- You do not know them.

234
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:08,889
- Are you waiting a lot?
- What if I take a lot?

235
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:11,843
- I'm late?
- Half an hour.

236
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:13,170
I am sorry.

237
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:16,004
- Coach!
- Yes, sir.

238
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:25,439
- Where are we going?
- Wherever you want.

239
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:28,402
- A "Next to the Rhine"?
- Very good.

240
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:31,569
Next to the Rhine.

241
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:51,404
- What do you think?
- He should not have come.

242
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:53,846
Do you regret it?

243
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:55,927
Why do not you say
What you think?

244
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:02,688
- Will you marry here or in Hamilton?
- Let's not talk about that today.

245
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:04,045
I am sorry.

246
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:06,362
Do not misunderstand me.

247
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:08,408
Corinne is great.
We grew up together.

248
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:12,963
We promised each other two years ago.
My mother really wants that wedding.

249
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:21,082
Walter, I think we should not
come back to see us.

250
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:27,448
Actually, see us
It has been crazy.

251
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:33,969
You're adorable.

252
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:38,602
When I hold you in my arms
it does not matter anything else.

253
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:40,809
It's like a drug.

254
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:45,159
I feel like leaving everything.

255
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,363
Let's see here.

256
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:26,920
I have never met nobody like t.

257
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:32,363
Why did not I meet you?
Years ago, before?

258
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,088
If I knew you my mother!

259
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:44,249
Look, my mother will come tomorrow.

260
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:46,642
I have tickets for the park.

261
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:50,520
You appear casually
as if you did not know.

262
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:53,000
- Do you understand?
- Yes, Walter.

263
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:56,288
We will be at the kiosk
from the band at three.

264
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:59,080
We will sit right
in front of the kiosk.

265
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:01,203
You will come, will not you?

266
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:05,680
Yes, Walter. There will be.

267
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:32,007
- What a crowd!
- Yes, mother.

268
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:33,649
Let's feel here.

269
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,923
Cara, he will love me.
Cruz, he will not love me.

270
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:39,884
Hello, you've already returned
of the church?

271
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:42,286
Ray, I have to talk to you.

272
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:45,408
You tell me later.
I'm in a hurry.

273
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:51,563
Why do you close?

274
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:54,529
- I have to talk now.
- Of what?

275
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:56,681
Hugo leaves the city.

276
00:22:57,050 --> 00:23:00,759
- And you worry?
- We have to stop him!

277
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,609
He has to stay and...

278
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:08,280
- Frida!
- No, Ray!

279
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:10,487
If mam found out!

280
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:13,880
Ray, you have to do something!

281
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:25,045
All right, talk to him tonight.

282
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:27,844
It will be too late!
I found it when I came back...

283
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:30,843
and leaves this afternoon
on the train at 3:20.

284
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:36,358
But Frida, I have
an important commitment.

285
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:39,524
A more appointment!
This is important.

286
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:41,238
Listen, Frida.

287
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,888
Nothing in the world is
so important

288
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:46,843
like today is in the park at 3.

289
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:49,289
Pray for me.

290
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:50,645
Give me luck!

291
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,529
Move away from the door.

292
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:56,644
If you do not come with me,
I swear I'll kill myself!

293
00:23:57,050 --> 00:24:00,406
I will not be able to continue living if!

294
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:02,682
- I'll kill myself!
- Frida!

295
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:07,359
Boba!

296
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:12,527
Ray, do not leave me!

297
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:17,281
I have nobody but you.

298
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:23,008
No, I will not leave you.

299
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:26,639
You can count on Ray.

300
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:33,207
Come on. Come on.

301
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:36,087
Let's see him now.

302
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:45,762
Take, drop your eyes.
That your mother does not see you.

303
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:15,769
Wall Street NY

304
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:43,849
Walter!

305
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:46,604
You will not be long
without talking to me!

306
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:48,689
Walter Saxel!

307
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:52,167
The same, in flesh and blood,
Miss Schmidt.

308
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:57,329
- The usual Walter.
- I have not changed in five years?

309
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:00,484
5 years ago you planted me
in the park.

310
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:02,886
- He did not leave you.
- Of course I do.

311
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:05,001
- No!
- Of course I do.

312
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:07,410
Excuse me.

313
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:10,646
We obstruct the traffic.

314
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:16,009
Let's see, where were we?
Oh, yes.

315
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:19,168
The music kiosk.
I was there and you were not.

316
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:20,763
I arrived somewhat late.

317
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:23,763
We stay until
that the concert ended.

318
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:25,841
He arrived when he left people.

319
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:29,247
- I was furious.
- It looked in your note.

320
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:31,281
- Was it hard?
- Tremendous.

321
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:34,442
- I am sorry.
- Jur do not forgive you.

322
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:36,288
But you have forgiven me.

323
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:39,078
- Yes.
- The same Ray Schmidt as always.

324
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:41,241
Just as good,
More young than ever.

325
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:43,487
And you're still so smart
as usual.

326
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:45,290
Thank you.

327
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:46,962
What have you been doing?

328
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:50,088
Many things, I will be
partner of my firm.

329
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:51,804
That's great!

330
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:53,770
And I have given birth to two children.

331
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:57,002
- What smart!
- Y t, what have you done?

332
00:27:57,610 --> 00:28:00,602
They are not going to make me
partner, but...

333
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:03,159
I am the best paid woman
of my company.

334
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:07,403
If we do not leave,
we will bury the snow.

335
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:08,650
Have dinner with me

336
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:10,602
- I have a commitment.
- R mpelo.

337
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:13,480
I will call my wife,
and will return at once.

338
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:18,163
- We'll have dinner together, what do you say?
- Very good.

339
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:36,410
Are we going?

340
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:08,606
- You're still beautiful.
- Thank you.

341
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:13,961
You know a lot of people
In New York?

342
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,170
Very much.

343
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:19,481
Is there anyone special?

344
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:37,650
75

345
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:41,690
Thank you.

346
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:52,526
I'm sorry I can not invite you.

347
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:56,403
No gentlemen are allowed
no dogs.

348
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:58,125
I understand.

349
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:02,087
My landlady has instincts
of bloodhound.

350
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:06,921
I guess we say goodbye here.

351
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:09,960
It has been great to see you again.

352
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:12,440
Really? I'm not sure.

353
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:18,639
It would have been better
not having seen us again.

354
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:20,365
But Walter!

355
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:23,289
I am sorry,
I did not want to say that.

356
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:24,770
Perd name.

357
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:29,127
Your memory has harassed me
day and night.

358
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:31,642
I tried to forget you.

359
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,480
And now, you come back to torture me.

360
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:37,402
Walter, honey!

361
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:40,921
What can I say? What can I do?

362
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:46,968
- Ray, you still care, do not you?
- You do not know?

363
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:00,003
When will I see you?

364
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:03,163
- When you want.
- I'll call you.

365
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:06,402
I'm going away two days.
I'll call you on Saturday.

366
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:10,199
You will find me in
Liberty 3270.

367
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:12,839
- Will you remember the number?
- I will never forget it.

368
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:16,519
- Adi s, honey.
- Adi s, Walter.

369
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:22,409
S bete the neck, do not get cold.

370
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:24,442
Be careful. Adi s.

371
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:44,568
Relax, I have loose.

372
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:46,765
How are you?

373
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:49,200
- I'm late?
- No heaven. Do we enter?

374
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:22,283
- Is for you.
- For me?

375
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:27,598
We could not continue
staying in the corners.

376
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:30,482
You do not care, do you?

377
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:37,522
No, Walter, I do not care.

378
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:21,685
Please, you want to call
to my number?

379
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:24,280
It seems to me that the phone
it does not work.

380
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:37,080
It does not work well.
Thank you very much.

381
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:44,008
After dinner,
nothing like my pipe.

382
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:45,930
In addition, I wanted to talk to you.

383
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:49,526
An excellent dinner
Corinne is perfect.

384
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:51,926
- And the house is beautiful.
- Thanks to you.

385
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:53,643
- How?
- You have paid for it.

386
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,879
Corinne has always been
my favorite niece.

387
00:33:57,130 --> 00:33:59,405
And in addition, you earned it.

388
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:04,690
And that reminds me of something.

389
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:09,403
- You leave for Europe last morning.
- T o Felix!

390
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:11,364
The Dalmatia negotiations.

391
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:13,681
- You were going t.
- I have changed my mind.

392
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:15,847
We need a man more young

393
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:18,161
I'm counting on you, Walter.

394
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:21,284
It is wonderful.
A great opportunity.

395
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:23,762
I will be good a vacation.

396
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:28,364
I suggest you take to Corinne.

397
00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:32,003
But Uncle Felix...

398
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:03,403
- Hello.
- Walter!

399
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:20,127
- Are you glad to see me?
- Sure! I did not expect it.

400
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:22,804
It should not be here,
but I could escape.

401
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:24,290
I had to see you.

402
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:26,486
- I'm glad.
- You've missed me?

403
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:28,960
You do not know how much.
It has been terrible!

404
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:32,003
- Only three days.
- Only three days!

405
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:35,282
For you it has not been much,
You have been very busy.

406
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:39,125
But, what happens to me?
Phone Slope,

407
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:43,039
to hear your key in the door,
waiting waiting...

408
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:47,005
- Walter, it's been terrible!
- I am so sorry. Really.

409
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,283
It does not matter anymore.

410
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:53,682
Come on, tell me!

411
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:56,166
- What?
- The great news!

412
00:35:56,970 --> 00:35:58,642
If I did not say anything...

413
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:01,963
You did not say anything else
since you entered.

414
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:07,364
Do not lie to me ever, my life.
You tell me everything without speaking.

415
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:10,887
Your way of entering,
to cross the room...

416
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:16,048
that look of an excited child.
I am also excited. What is it?

417
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:20,767
It is exciting. Remember
the negotiations of Dalmatia?

418
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:25,362
T o Felix has decided not to go
and send me to me.

419
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:30,525
- We left after tomorrow.
- Passed tomorrow? To Europe?

420
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:34,882
- I can not believe it!
- What?

421
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:38,845
Europe! Not even
I dared to dream it.

422
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:41,765
Just going there would be wonderful.

423
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:46,083
But my first trip with you!
Walter!

424
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:56,930
Ray...
I'm afraid you do not understand.

425
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:01,963
I can not ask you to come with me.

426
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:08,878
Do not think I do not want to.
It hurts as much as it does you.

427
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:12,965
But Uncle Felix... It scared me.

428
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:16,642
It's like a sphinx,
you never know what he thinks.

429
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:23,008
He talks a lot about appearances
and he said he should take Corinne.

430
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:25,409
There is no one who understands!
Schedule scan it!

431
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:27,084
It is awful. Pass.

432
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:31,403
My husband told the landlord today
If we do not lower the rent, we move.

433
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:35,121
From all the houses
in which we have lived!

434
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:40,926
Although the hardest is you.

435
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:46,079
Remove a lot
of air and light, right?

436
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:47,519
It is a pity.

437
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:50,199
- Why do not you move?
- Right now I can not.

438
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:55,042
Of course, until your husband returns.
He's been away for a long time, right?

439
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:57,048
- Yes.
- Go back soon?

440
00:38:57,410 --> 00:39:00,129
Your work is unpredictable.
It is hard to say.

441
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:03,761
Yes, I understand.
What is it, a tree?

442
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:07,048
No, it's a flower, is not it?
Is beautiful.

443
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:10,609
"Well, I almost forgot
why he had come!"

444
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:13,763
- Do you leave me a couple of lemons?
- Yes, of course.

445
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:17,286
My husband is arriving.
He loves lemonade.

446
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:24,004
And today I do not have...
Oh, is this your husband?

447
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:28,208
Well yes, it's him.

448
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:34,246
"Well, how handsome he is!
S that is brown!"

449
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:37,328
- Here's the lemons.
- Thank you very much.

450
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:41,329
- May I bring them to you.
- No hurry.

451
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:45,160
Let's see when they finish!
The floor is worse than mine.

452
00:39:57,930 --> 00:40:01,559
<i>It came well to Paris.
I wish you were with me.</i>

453
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:08,122
<i>I have to stay longer.
I miss you so much.</i>

454
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:21,806
<i>- Help!
- What was that?</i>

455
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:24,968
Help! Help!

456
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:27,201
- What happened?
- An accident!

457
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:30,363
- The oven has exploded!
- My eyes!

458
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:33,363
- Call the firemen!
- A doctor, hurry!

459
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:38,122
Why do not you let me
Call your husband?

460
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:41,208
- No, do not call him!
- Well, he will not.

461
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:48,527
- I'm bothering you a lot.
- Do not worry.

462
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:51,608
You have been very kind.

463
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:57,006
Who are you? What is it called?
Ray Schmidt, your neighbor.

464
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:04,160
What has the doctor said?
Will it be disfigured?

465
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:06,364
Of course not.

466
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:09,087
I do not know what Jim will say.

467
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:13,808
- Let me call you.
- No, you must not!

468
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:15,405
He forbade me.

469
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:18,403
- In such a case...
- Do not understand.

470
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:25,206
I...
He is not really my husband.

471
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:29,479
He is married.

472
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:51,130
- Ray Schmidt!
- Kurt Shendler!

473
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:56,321
I knew that this was your house, but not
I expected to meet you at the door.

474
00:41:57,210 --> 00:42:01,408
- How pretty you are!
- Wait until I recover!

475
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:04,444
- Where do you come from?
- Detroit.

476
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:08,001
Jam s would have recognized you!
How well you are!

477
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:11,640
And you're doing well!
What have you been doing?

478
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:15,088
- Is it that you do not know?
- Knowing what?

479
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:18,049
You do not know the Kurt Sussex?

480
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:21,407
- Sure, everyone knows them.
- Well, I'm that Kurt.

481
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:24,160
- T?
- Of course I am.

482
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:27,244
Kurt, I can not believe it!

483
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:29,958
- What are you doing here?
- Business trip.

484
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:33,486
It's my first trip to New York
and I want to see the city.

485
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:36,563
And you teach it to me?
Tact done?

486
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:38,249
You can be sure.

487
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:41,123
Let's go somewhere
where it makes less heat.

488
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:45,168
This is wonderful!

489
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:48,564
- For me, it's a party.
- What do you want to eat?

490
00:42:53,890 --> 00:42:55,243
Do you know, Kurt?

491
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:58,278
I can not explain.
What have you done to yourself?

492
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:02,969
Remember that I had
the hair of end?

493
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:04,968
Well, I've crushed it.

494
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:08,128
I changed my glasses,
I wear a suit instead of a monkey.

495
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:12,243
But other than that,
I'm still the same as always.

496
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:15,449
How did you find me?

497
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:18,409
I wrote to Frida, she says that
you are still in the same bouquet.

498
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:23,845
- Now I'm on vacations.
- That's great.

499
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:27,640
Because I have a huge list
of places to go.

500
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:44,042
- Hello!
- Hello!

501
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:46,088
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

502
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:48,366
- Come, come on.
- Very good.

503
00:44:02,290 --> 00:44:05,362
Say? Hi, Kurt.

504
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:10,159
No, nothing.

505
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:15,119
I would love it.
Wait a minute, pass!

506
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:17,643
Now I'm going.

507
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:20,884
Yes, Kurt.

508
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:24,045
Why?

509
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:29,359
Very good.

510
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:31,918
About seven o'clock?

511
00:44:33,890 --> 00:44:36,358
Yes, I'll be ready. Adi s.

512
00:44:39,770 --> 00:44:40,770
Are you going out today?

513
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:44,519
Play the Detroit team.
Do not see how Kurt shouted.

514
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:46,606
- He's a great guy.
- It's great.

515
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:49,678
Have you been crying, True?

516
00:44:50,050 --> 00:44:53,486
Ray, I'm going crazy
if I do not know something about Jim.

517
00:44:54,410 --> 00:44:58,119
Francine, I hope you stop crying.
He does not deserve it.

518
00:44:58,850 --> 00:45:00,568
Does anyone deserve it?

519
00:45:01,850 --> 00:45:04,887
I know that now
It's very hard, but...

520
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:07,007
But is better.

521
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:09,087
Now you are free
to do what you want.

522
00:45:09,890 --> 00:45:12,358
But Ray, I love him!

523
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:16,282
And he? Surely I
He loves you too, does not he?

524
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:18,805
Before, he loved me very much.
And I only asked him that.

525
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:21,484
I would have done any
thing for him.

526
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:23,448
He just wanted his love.

527
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:27,488
It's the only thing you have.
The only thing you will have.

528
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:30,328
And not for long.

529
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:35,285
What can it do for you
a man like him?

530
00:45:36,130 --> 00:45:40,089
It can be seen with you,
introduce yourself to your friends?

531
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:46,004
You can only hide in a
alley where you wait

532
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:51,569
when the phone rings, to
arrive postcards without a signature.

533
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:56,366
If I could hate him!
If I could stop loving him!

534
00:45:56,650 --> 00:46:01,929
Francine, esc chame. D jalo
before it is too late.

535
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:07,204
Find a good boy, c sate,
have children Only then will you be happy.

536
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:09,846
I know what I'm talking about.

537
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:13,247
There is not a woman in a million
who has found happiness

538
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:15,526
in an alley.

539
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:22,330
Hi, Ray.

540
00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:28,758
Walter!

541
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:30,959
Cari o!

542
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:46,208
I present to a friend
Oh, Francine.

543
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:47,844
Francine, this is...

544
00:46:49,570 --> 00:46:52,448
- It's Walter!
- Enchanted, Mr. Schmidt.

545
00:46:52,770 --> 00:46:55,409
- Pleasure.
- I've heard a lot about you.

546
00:46:55,810 --> 00:46:59,325
- Well, I'm leaving.
- See you soon.

547
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:02,284
- Goodnight.
- I'll pass by your house.

548
00:47:05,650 --> 00:47:07,049
Walter!

549
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:08,684
Cari o!

550
00:47:09,370 --> 00:47:10,519
When have you arrived?

551
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:13,201
I did not know that today
a boat arrived.

552
00:47:13,490 --> 00:47:15,450
- When did you arrive?
- The day before yesterday.

553
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:19,007
Yesterday?

554
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:22,678
Walter, you've been two days
In New York!

555
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:25,922
I've been so busy...
You can not imagine it.

556
00:47:26,570 --> 00:47:30,006
I know, Walter. But,
Could not you have called?

557
00:47:30,290 --> 00:47:33,327
I wanted to call you many times,
but I could not.

558
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:38,246
- Perd name, please.
- Of course I do.

559
00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:44,925
What's the summer?
You seems to be exhausted.

560
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:48,401
It will be better when cool.
It has been frightening.

561
00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:51,882
T o Felix wrote me that
It has been the worst in 30 years.

562
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:55,606
In contrast, in Europe
He had to put on a coat.

563
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:57,529
And Switzerland!

564
00:47:58,330 --> 00:48:01,049
Suiza? I did not know
that you were going to Switzerland.

565
00:48:01,930 --> 00:48:03,045
Did not he write it to you?

566
00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:06,083
I received three postcards
throughout the summer.

567
00:48:06,370 --> 00:48:11,364
I know I wrote you more letters.
They must have been lost.

568
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:13,529
It's possible.

569
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:18,522
Finally, when finishing the
negotiations, thought:

570
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:22,082
Why not take advantage
and see Europe?

571
00:48:22,370 --> 00:48:24,651
I spent four weeks watching
France, Switzerland, Italy...

572
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:26,888
It was wonderful!

573
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:31,368
And when you left you did not see
the time to return.

574
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:32,650
Four weeks!

575
00:48:32,890 --> 00:48:35,324
Well, it was my first
trip to Europe.

576
00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:39,042
You only told me
It has been very hot.

577
00:48:39,410 --> 00:48:43,369
There is not much to tell.
You already know how time passes.

578
00:48:43,570 --> 00:48:46,482
Making loners,
fixing some dress...

579
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:50,599
going to the market...
I have started painting porcelain.

580
00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:54,884
So he had something to do.
In addition, he sold some pieces.

581
00:48:55,130 --> 00:48:58,008
Why? I do not like
that you do those things.

582
00:48:58,530 --> 00:49:01,124
There is no concrete reason,
Walter.

583
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:05,120
But sometimes, you want to have
money in your pocket.

584
00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:07,003
Ray!

585
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:12,606
I forgot to leave you money
for those four weeks.

586
00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:17,369
I'll fix it tomorrow.
I hope you did not have problems.

587
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:20,005
Absolutely. I managed it well.

588
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:23,560
- I'm sorry...
- I do not want you to feel it.

589
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:26,046
I was not looking for your compassion.

590
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:28,845
I do not feel worthy of compassion.

591
00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:34,486
It would be a summer again
how is this if necessary?

592
00:49:36,050 --> 00:49:38,610
But there is something
that we must solve.

593
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,607
There have been terrible moments.

594
00:49:42,290 --> 00:49:45,521
I left my job to
be free when you came.

595
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:48,318
Very good. But, what do I have?

596
00:49:48,570 --> 00:49:51,403
Loners, wait
to the phone ringing,

597
00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:55,604
wait for you to come,
die when you do not show up...

598
00:49:56,010 --> 00:49:59,764
I can not meet your friends,
nor make friends of their own.

599
00:50:01,330 --> 00:50:03,639
You do not know what empties
that is my life.

600
00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:07,049
Vac a, honey?
When do you have me?

601
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:11,001
That is just the question.
I do not always have you.

602
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:12,922
This summer I have not had you.

603
00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:19,006
And every time you're more busy.
There will be more trips without Ray.

604
00:50:20,330 --> 00:50:26,121
I can not continue like this, waiting,
dreaming, with empty hands.

605
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:30,799
Walter... give me a son.

606
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:36,525
Ray! Have you gone crazy?

607
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:39,844
I do not understand how
you can suggest it!

608
00:50:40,610 --> 00:50:43,841
Have you thought about the consequences?

609
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:45,769
Unclear.

610
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:48,041
They would be terrible,
at least for me.

611
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:51,129
Think of the esc ndalo,
it would end with my future.

612
00:50:51,490 --> 00:50:52,490
It's unthinkable!

613
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:54,363
After all, You are not my wife.

614
00:50:58,050 --> 00:50:59,165
Ray!

615
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:01,248
I did not want to say that!

616
00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:04,648
Do not worry.

617
00:51:07,170 --> 00:51:09,638
You are tired.
Today you are not t,

618
00:51:09,930 --> 00:51:12,364
or you would not have suggested
something like that.

619
00:51:14,090 --> 00:51:18,083
You are right. I'm tired.

620
00:51:53,770 --> 00:51:56,364
Ray... I have to go.

621
00:51:57,090 --> 00:51:58,603
You know.

622
00:51:59,170 --> 00:52:00,922
I'm so sorry, honey.

623
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:11,845
- Perd name.
- Of course I do.

624
00:52:22,490 --> 00:52:24,367
Tomorrow everything will be different.

625
00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:38,927
Adi s, Walter.

626
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:35,444
Ahead.

627
00:53:36,970 --> 00:53:38,528
I'm sorry I'm late.

628
00:53:38,930 --> 00:53:41,569
But when I was going to leave,
They gave me a call.

629
00:53:42,650 --> 00:53:44,083
I have to return.

630
00:53:44,490 --> 00:53:45,490
To Detroit?

631
00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:47,208
- Tonight.
- I am sorry.

632
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:50,448
But it's a shame,
with the plans we had.

633
00:53:51,850 --> 00:53:54,967
I had never had it as well.

634
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:58,364
But it is an important agreement.
I have to return.

635
00:53:59,890 --> 00:54:03,246
Although I would like to leave it
and stay with you.

636
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:10,008
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing.

637
00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:14,080
Only today I am very strange.

638
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:19,367
It's been great to have you here.

639
00:54:20,850 --> 00:54:24,843
I'm sorry you're leaving like that.
I will miss you.

640
00:54:25,370 --> 00:54:26,962
I'm glad you told me that.

641
00:54:28,090 --> 00:54:32,766
Leave like this, so suddenly
It gives me courage to ask you something.

642
00:54:33,530 --> 00:54:35,130
Something that I have already asked for.

643
00:54:35,530 --> 00:54:38,761
Something that will keep asking
if I keep my health.

644
00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:42,049
I do not blame you
that you would reject me.

645
00:54:42,410 --> 00:54:45,846
Then it was a simple
and poorer than rats.

646
00:54:46,090 --> 00:54:47,648
- Not that...
- Let me finish.

647
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:51,443
Just when I collect value,
you interrupt me.

648
00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:53,038
Have compassion.

649
00:54:53,530 --> 00:54:58,923
Anyway, now I'm rich, or almost.
And I'm still crazy about you.

650
00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:01,089
Do you accept me, Ray?

651
00:55:02,410 --> 00:55:05,163
- You're a great guy.
- Yes, I already know that.

652
00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:07,481
But that does not answer
to my question.

653
00:55:08,410 --> 00:55:09,559
Do you accept?

654
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:14,686
Kurt, Do you know what I am?

655
00:55:15,210 --> 00:55:18,088
Ray Schmidt, the girl
the world's greatest.

656
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:31,802
- Of course if you're not free...
- I am.

657
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:37,648
It was not, Kurt, but I already am.

658
00:55:40,850 --> 00:55:47,688
<i>So, this is the end
of ours, Walter.</i>

659
00:55:49,770 --> 00:55:57,770
<i>I'm coming home to Cincinnati, and...</i>

660
00:56:13,530 --> 00:56:15,122
Again the door!

661
00:56:19,450 --> 00:56:21,406
Excuse me, live here
Mrs. Hugo Hank?

662
00:56:21,770 --> 00:56:23,886
Yes, but if you are a seller,
I warn you...

663
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:28,203
I do not sell anything,
I'm looking for Ray Schmidt.

664
00:56:28,650 --> 00:56:31,767
I am so sorry.
Do not you want to pass?

665
00:56:33,570 --> 00:56:37,882
I did not want to be so rude, but I
they interrupt ten times a day.

666
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:40,320
Almost always to sell something.

667
00:56:40,650 --> 00:56:45,565
Back at any time.
He has gone to the shopping center.

668
00:56:45,890 --> 00:56:50,680
- Mam, who is it?
- What manners are those, Hugo?

669
00:56:51,570 --> 00:56:55,040
These are my children, sir...
I have not heard his name.

670
00:56:55,290 --> 00:56:57,326
- Walter Saxel.
- Yes, Mr. Saxel.

671
00:56:57,610 --> 00:56:59,487
This is Hugo, and little Ray.

672
00:57:02,810 --> 00:57:04,448
- Hi, Ray.
- Hello.

673
00:57:06,490 --> 00:57:08,879
- You're a beautiful girl.
- Yes.

674
00:57:11,570 --> 00:57:15,006
- How is Ray?
- Divinely. Just arrived.

675
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:16,649
He will be married soon.

676
00:57:17,010 --> 00:57:19,570
With Kurt Shendler, a great man.

677
00:57:19,850 --> 00:57:23,843
Fig. They laugh at him
because he believed in the car.

678
00:57:24,770 --> 00:57:26,681
I was one of the few people
who encouraged him.

679
00:57:29,370 --> 00:57:32,885
- I think nothing is missing.
- See you later, Kurt.

680
00:57:47,090 --> 00:57:48,205
Hi, Ray.

681
00:57:48,890 --> 00:57:49,890
Hi.

682
00:57:50,850 --> 00:57:52,363
I found your note on the floor.

683
00:57:54,050 --> 00:57:56,086
It's not true that
this is the end.

684
00:58:10,410 --> 00:58:14,801
- I've missed you.
- Me too to you.

685
00:58:16,450 --> 00:58:19,601
If you wanted to make me suffer,
You've got it.

686
00:58:21,210 --> 00:58:22,484
It has been frightening.

687
00:58:24,330 --> 00:58:27,879
I did not think I could
need so much nobody.

688
00:58:29,170 --> 00:58:31,206
I have no right
to ask you nothing.

689
00:58:31,770 --> 00:58:33,328
Call me selfish.

690
00:58:33,770 --> 00:58:36,238
I can not offer you anything
of what you could have:

691
00:58:36,530 --> 00:58:39,681
A home, a name, some children.

692
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:46,846
I'm just one thing.
I need you. I love you.

693
00:58:49,210 --> 00:58:51,166
Come back with me, Ray.

694
00:59:00,290 --> 00:59:05,125
You try to run away from something.
Your site is with me.

695
00:59:05,490 --> 00:59:06,639
But Walter!

696
00:59:12,370 --> 00:59:17,444
If I go back now,
Where will it end?

697
00:59:19,370 --> 00:59:21,042
I love you, Ray.

698
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:45,806
This trip makes me very excited.
I'm sorry you can not accompany me.

699
00:59:46,290 --> 00:59:48,360
- You work too much.
- I'll find time.

700
00:59:50,050 --> 00:59:52,041
- Hello, captain.
- Hello, Mr. Saxel.

701
00:59:52,330 --> 00:59:53,604
Nice to have you here.

702
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:55,846
Do you remember Mrs. Saxel?

703
00:59:57,210 --> 00:59:58,609
- My son...
- Charmed.

704
00:59:59,130 --> 01:00:00,610
- And my daughter.
- It is a pleasure.

705
01:00:01,090 --> 01:00:02,205
I hope we have a good trip.

706
01:00:02,530 --> 01:00:05,886
If you need anything,
Do not hesitate to call me.

707
01:00:13,530 --> 01:00:17,284
- Excuse me, Mr. Saxel.
- Where can I serve you?

708
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:20,408
What will you say to the commission?
Of Berlin?

709
01:00:20,690 --> 01:00:23,648
I have no idea
Maybe you can help me.

710
01:00:23,930 --> 01:00:24,930
Sr. Saxel!

711
01:00:25,130 --> 01:00:26,358
Suppose I tell you.

712
01:00:26,650 --> 01:00:30,643
Someone would take over
of my brilliant ideas.

713
01:00:30,930 --> 01:00:32,204
- No thanks.
- Thank you.

714
01:00:32,530 --> 01:00:34,202
A moment!

715
01:00:39,290 --> 01:00:42,805
There is half of life there
by Walter Saxel.

716
01:00:43,370 --> 01:00:46,009
- And there's the other half.
- Where?

717
01:00:46,370 --> 01:00:49,203
That beautiful woman
of the silver fox.

718
01:00:54,930 --> 01:00:57,000
It does not look like
of devourer of men.

719
01:00:57,650 --> 01:00:58,765
Of course.

720
01:00:59,250 --> 01:01:02,959
But go where Saxel goes,
his shadow will follow him.

721
01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:07,038
- Will Corinne know?
- I doubt it.

722
01:01:07,570 --> 01:01:11,324
For Corinne, a mistress
It is a novel character.

723
01:01:11,570 --> 01:01:14,084
- Thank you very much.
- Come here, please.

724
01:01:15,850 --> 01:01:19,206
I can make one here
with his family?

725
01:01:27,530 --> 01:01:29,646
- Look, Dick!
- Where?

726
01:01:32,370 --> 01:01:33,564
Beware of the step.

727
01:01:35,450 --> 01:01:37,884
Could you tell me
My cabin, please?

728
01:01:40,330 --> 01:01:41,683
How do you know?

729
01:01:42,450 --> 01:01:45,840
Good girls we will be
blind, but not stupid.

730
01:01:47,930 --> 01:01:50,319
- He has seen us.
- I'm not moving.

731
01:01:50,650 --> 01:01:52,561
Through the second corridor
on the left.

732
01:01:55,010 --> 01:01:56,443
I'm sick!

733
01:01:56,970 --> 01:01:59,882
It has already humbled us enough.
We have to do something.

734
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:03,606
- Who is going to do it?
- I.

735
01:03:15,290 --> 01:03:18,805
- Good evening, Miss Schmidt.
- Good evening, Mr. Saxel.

736
01:03:19,250 --> 01:03:22,128
- Have you already had dinner?
- Yes, thank you.

737
01:03:23,010 --> 01:03:25,570
I'm afraid I can not see you
In this travel.

738
01:03:26,130 --> 01:03:28,166
Do not worry.

739
01:03:28,610 --> 01:03:31,568
It seems that everyone
He knows me.

740
01:03:31,970 --> 01:03:33,289
I understand.

741
01:03:36,690 --> 01:03:39,921
We'll see each other in Paris.
In the usual place.

742
01:03:40,690 --> 01:03:44,399
I want to consult you things
before the conference.

743
01:04:14,850 --> 01:04:18,968
But hey, what's the matter with you?
You have taken it with that bitch.

744
01:04:19,410 --> 01:04:23,801
As I caught you,
I will make you picadillo, bobo.

745
01:04:24,090 --> 01:04:26,604
Let's go. S abete to your chair.

746
01:04:34,970 --> 01:04:36,688
I've made you something hot.

747
01:04:38,530 --> 01:04:40,088
I love this place.

748
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:42,970
It's a simple hotel,
but you give it something special.

749
01:04:43,330 --> 01:04:45,048
"The magic touch
of a woman's hand

750
01:04:46,050 --> 01:04:48,848
illuminates up
the darkest corner."

751
01:04:49,170 --> 01:04:50,842
Thanks, honey.

752
01:04:58,010 --> 01:05:01,889
Nothing like a chocolate
French made by you.

753
01:05:02,130 --> 01:05:04,325
Thank you.
Do you want some cookies?

754
01:05:11,970 --> 01:05:13,881
By the way, Where is my speech?

755
01:05:14,330 --> 01:05:16,924
There. You already have it ready.

756
01:05:24,530 --> 01:05:25,599
Here it is.

757
01:05:26,330 --> 01:05:28,924
- Do you like it?
- It's the best you've written.

758
01:05:29,890 --> 01:05:31,767
You did not say anything
of your contribution.

759
01:05:32,330 --> 01:05:35,879
- My contribution?
- Your contribution.

760
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:38,890
I used to cheat myself thinking
that everything was more than mine.

761
01:05:39,370 --> 01:05:42,965
A very bright guy.
But it is not true.

762
01:05:43,410 --> 01:05:45,287
Walter, do not be absurd!

763
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:53,802
Now do not start arguing.
I'm not in the mood for nonsense.

764
01:05:54,090 --> 01:05:57,002
- I would not hit a lady.
- Do not provoke me.

765
01:06:08,650 --> 01:06:11,483
Par s always takes out
your animal facet.

766
01:06:11,970 --> 01:06:15,121
Sit down and be nice.
This is not a way to rest.

767
01:06:18,490 --> 01:06:20,799
You are getting more and more beautiful.

768
01:06:21,490 --> 01:06:23,242
You will be divine with white hair.

769
01:06:23,570 --> 01:06:26,528
You never drank it,
I hate artificiality.

770
01:06:26,810 --> 01:06:30,883
Besides, it's not going for you.
You are too authentic.

771
01:06:42,050 --> 01:06:44,405
I would like to take you to Berlin.

772
01:06:44,850 --> 01:06:48,479
- Will you go back a lot?
- Four days. I'll go on a plane.

773
01:06:48,850 --> 01:06:50,602
Check it well while I'm away.

774
01:06:52,330 --> 01:06:56,846
Do not worry. Unseat the casino.

775
01:06:57,930 --> 01:06:59,409
Player!

776
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:02,205
Remind me to leave you
money before leaving.

777
01:08:28,530 --> 01:08:29,679
Ahead.

778
01:08:45,930 --> 01:08:49,320
I think we do not need
presentation, Ms. Schmidt.

779
01:08:49,650 --> 01:08:51,242
I've been around for years.

780
01:08:51,610 --> 01:08:54,363
He has been following us
like an odious shadow.

781
01:08:54,650 --> 01:08:58,689
Everyone knows less my mother.
And she will find out soon.

782
01:08:59,130 --> 01:09:02,918
My sister is going to enter
in an aristocratic family.

783
01:09:03,250 --> 01:09:06,322
If they inquire about you,
my mother will find out.

784
01:09:06,770 --> 01:09:09,330
She does not imagine
that there are women like you.

785
01:09:09,570 --> 01:09:13,802
I want you never to know.
"Leave us alone, Mrs. Schmidt!"

786
01:09:14,050 --> 01:09:15,881
I would throw it out if I could.

787
01:09:16,090 --> 01:09:19,321
You are all cold,
egoists, calculators.

788
01:09:19,530 --> 01:09:23,000
They only have one purpose:
Secure your position.

789
01:09:23,570 --> 01:09:26,004
I will not ask you to think
in my sister or in me.

790
01:09:26,490 --> 01:09:28,845
What are the children
for someone like you?

791
01:09:29,090 --> 01:09:31,558
I have not come to discuss,
but to warn her!

792
01:09:31,850 --> 01:09:35,206
Leave my father alone!
For always!

793
01:09:36,930 --> 01:09:38,761
You will receive a compensation.

794
01:09:39,090 --> 01:09:41,809
After all, Money is what counts.

795
01:09:43,770 --> 01:09:44,770
Ahead.

796
01:09:50,970 --> 01:09:52,289
Hi, Dick.

797
01:10:04,570 --> 01:10:06,481
- What are you doing here?
- I have the right.

798
01:10:07,490 --> 01:10:11,483
I do not doubt it, son.
What are you doing here?

799
01:10:12,330 --> 01:10:14,844
- I've asked your...
- Dick.

800
01:10:21,490 --> 01:10:24,766
Sit down, son.
I want to talk to you.

801
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:34,249
Do not go.

802
01:10:54,370 --> 01:10:55,883
Sit down, son.

803
01:11:06,210 --> 01:11:09,805
Dick, a long time before
that you were born,

804
01:11:10,050 --> 01:11:11,970
two months before I got married
With your mother.

805
01:11:12,610 --> 01:11:14,680
I met Ray Schmidt.

806
01:11:32,690 --> 01:11:35,329
For 25 years
we have loved each other.

807
01:11:36,130 --> 01:11:40,601
You are too young
to know how much time that is.

808
01:11:41,890 --> 01:11:44,848
I have not removed
to my family what I gave him.

809
01:11:45,530 --> 01:11:50,809
You did not want it
and she was happy to receive it.

810
01:11:51,530 --> 01:11:55,284
And she gave me what nobody
He had offered me.

811
01:11:57,370 --> 01:12:00,282
This part of my life
It's just more.

812
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:05,484
You can not enter it.
Nor force me to abandon it.

813
01:12:07,330 --> 01:12:08,763
That is all.

814
01:12:10,250 --> 01:12:12,684
What do you want me to do,
who applauds?

815
01:12:14,170 --> 01:12:17,321
I want you to understand
if you are mature enough.

816
01:12:17,570 --> 01:12:18,969
And if I'm not?

817
01:12:20,170 --> 01:12:23,207
Then, oc pate
of your affairs and leave.

818
01:12:24,330 --> 01:12:25,365
I will go.

819
01:12:26,890 --> 01:12:28,289
But it's my business.

820
01:12:28,850 --> 01:12:30,602
You are despicable!

821
01:12:32,850 --> 01:12:34,408
Outside!

822
01:12:41,650 --> 01:12:44,960
Walter, you should not
to have spoken to him like that.

823
01:12:45,610 --> 01:12:46,963
He is your son.

824
01:12:49,370 --> 01:12:50,689
Naturally.

825
01:12:52,330 --> 01:12:56,039
And I love him more
about you think.

826
01:12:59,090 --> 01:13:02,924
But I would give gladly
everything I have, life itself,

827
01:13:04,610 --> 01:13:06,646
for that little nose of yours.

828
01:13:42,010 --> 01:13:43,443
I love you.

829
01:13:45,490 --> 01:13:50,120
- I know, I...
- Do not ever leave me.

830
01:13:51,450 --> 01:13:53,088
I will not leave you, Walter.

831
01:14:05,090 --> 01:14:07,126
Tomorrow we will have
the day for us.

832
01:14:07,370 --> 01:14:08,405
Are you happy?

833
01:14:10,050 --> 01:14:12,690
It will come in the first hour
and we will have breakfast together.

834
01:14:17,410 --> 01:14:25,328
- What did Richard say?
- Nothing important, Walter.

835
01:14:27,170 --> 01:14:30,048
Breakfast is at 9.

836
01:14:31,210 --> 01:14:36,967
You know I'm always punctual
when it comes to your breakfasts.

837
01:14:40,370 --> 01:14:44,329
- Good evening, honey.
- Goodnight.

838
01:15:08,570 --> 01:15:09,889
Ahead.

839
01:15:13,410 --> 01:15:14,968
Good morning, ma'am.

840
01:15:15,290 --> 01:15:17,850
- It's been a precious day.
- Thank you.

841
01:15:30,290 --> 01:15:33,407

Wants to talk to you.

Do you want to talk to me?

854
01:16:37,570 --> 01:16:39,640
Alone.

855
01:16:41,690 --> 01:16:44,284
Sorry, pap wants
talk to me for a moment.

856

01:17:42,250 --> 01:17:48,359
- Montparnasse 6753?
- Yes, yes.

863
01:17:57,290 --> 01:17:59,246
Wait a moment.

864
01:18:26,490 --> 01:18:31,883

- Walter.

865

I can not hear you, honey.
What do you want to tell me?

867

Hurry, doctor!

870
01:19:23,570 --> 01:19:25,083
Doctor, do not breathe.

871
01:19:25,770 --> 01:19:27,089
Has died.

872
01:19:33,490 --> 01:19:37,961
Walter! Walter, Walter!

Do not abandon me!
Do not abandon me!

Cari o...

My life...

876

<i>Today the funeral is celebrated
by Walter Saxel.</i>

877
01:20:06,370 --> 01:20:09,601
<i>The funeral for Walter Saxel,

Ahead.

881
01:20:45,290 --> 01:20:46,643
Can I pass?

882
01:20:57,690 --> 01:21:00,204
My father would have loved
that came.

883
01:21:01,650 --> 01:21:04,960
I guess he knows everything.

884
01:21:07,370 --> 01:21:09,645
His last thought It was for you.

885
01:21:14,050 --> 01:21:18,123
I called her and he tried
talk to him, but...

886
01:21:19,490 --> 01:21:22,448
Mrs. Schmidt, my father would have
I wanted to leave you something.

887
01:21:22,930 --> 01:21:25,444
I know for a reason
who said that night.

888
01:21:26,010 --> 01:21:28,240
Naturally,
It does not appear in your will.

889
01:21:30,170 --> 01:21:31,842
Did he take care of you?

890
01:21:33,850 --> 01:21:38,640
My father how much?
I mean, what amount?

891
01:21:39,090 --> 01:21:40,159
200 dollars.

892
01:21:40,450 --> 01:21:42,805
- A week?
- A month.

893
01:21:45,130 --> 01:21:48,566
- In total?
- Total.

894
01:21:50,130 --> 01:21:51,165
Good heavens!

895
01:21:54,890 --> 01:21:56,403
Do you want to stay here?

896
01:22:00,290 --> 01:22:02,599
I would like to go home.

897
01:22:03,330 --> 01:22:04,763
Yes, of course.

898
01:22:21,850 --> 01:22:24,887
Every first of the month
I will receive the money.

899
01:22:25,850 --> 01:22:30,526
If you need anything,
Do not hesitate to call me.

900
01:22:51,650 --> 01:22:53,322
Walter!

901
01:22:55,010 --> 01:22:59,526
Your son is going to take care of me.

902
01:23:00,010 --> 01:23:02,160
He was so kind!

903
01:23:02,650 --> 01:23:04,641
It could have been my son.

904
01:23:07,170 --> 01:23:10,845
Our son.

905
01:23:15,490 --> 01:23:21,087
Walter, I wonder...
what would have happened

906
01:23:23,410 --> 01:23:25,605
if your mother I had known

907
01:23:26,970 --> 01:23:28,403
that day...

908
01:23:29,970 --> 01:23:31,881
in the park.

909
01:23:56,810 --> 01:23:59,040
Mother, this is Ray Schmidt.

910
01:24:01,090 --> 01:24:06,084
So you're Ray. You're lovely.

911
01:24:06,690 --> 01:24:10,205
My daughter,
you have my blessing

912
01:24:10,570 --> 01:24:12,879
and I hope you know very happy.

913
01:24:15,570 --> 01:24:17,083
Are we going?

914
01:24:25,250 --> 01:24:27,127
I'm coming, Walter.

915
01:24:30,570 --> 01:24:32,128
I'm going.
