1
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:24,248
Ain't but one kind of blues.

2
00:00:25,557 --> 00:00:28,754
And that consisted between

3
00:00:29,395 --> 00:00:32,455
male and female that's in love.

4
00:00:33,432 --> 00:00:37,493
In love, just like
I sung one of them songs a while ago

5
00:00:37,603 --> 00:00:41,767
and I put a verse in there
saying that love hide all fault

6
00:00:41,874 --> 00:00:44,502
and make you do things
you don't wanna do.

7
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,171
Love sometimes
will leave you feeling sad and blue.

8
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,511
I'm talking about the blues!
I ain't talking about monkey junk.

9
00:00:51,617 --> 00:00:55,713
And it consisted
between male and female.

10
00:00:55,821 --> 00:01:01,316
And that means two people,
supposed to be in love

11
00:01:01,427 --> 00:01:04,055
when one or the other

12
00:01:04,997 --> 00:01:09,127
deceives the other through their love.

13
00:02:16,201 --> 00:02:17,361
Ronnie?

14
00:02:21,974 --> 00:02:24,067
Are you okay? Baby?

15
00:02:27,179 --> 00:02:28,840
Baby. Baby.

16
00:02:28,947 --> 00:02:31,211
It's okay. It's okay.

17
00:02:31,316 --> 00:02:34,945
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

18
00:02:35,821 --> 00:02:36,879
It's okay.

19
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:42,823
I never laid a hand on her in anger.

20
00:02:43,562 --> 00:02:47,225
Not one time, R.L.
Not even when I was drinking.

21
00:02:47,332 --> 00:02:48,890
But this here business
got me wondering

22
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:50,992
what a good shake and slap
would do for her.

23
00:02:51,103 --> 00:02:53,003
We gonna keep that talk
between us now.

24
00:02:53,105 --> 00:02:54,834
Don't you go in there
with that shit on your tongue.

25
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,805
I ain't start this shit, R.L.

26
00:03:00,012 --> 00:03:02,537
You wanna pray with me
before you go in, Laz?

27
00:03:07,219 --> 00:03:11,019
Heavenly Father, we do not question
your divine plan for us,

28
00:03:11,123 --> 00:03:14,615
but in these times,
when our spirit lies in shadow,

29
00:03:14,726 --> 00:03:17,718
when we are lost,
we ask for your strength.

30
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:21,459
We ask for strength
to surpass all understanding.

31
00:03:21,567 --> 00:03:24,968
In your name we pray. Amen.

32
00:03:34,613 --> 00:03:37,639
Can't remember the last time
I saw you in that suit.

33
00:03:37,749 --> 00:03:39,580
At your mamma's funeral.

34
00:03:40,452 --> 00:03:42,079
I was a pallbearer, remember?

35
00:03:42,187 --> 00:03:44,655
How about I get you folks some coffee
before I take your order?

36
00:03:44,756 --> 00:03:47,418
We won't be staying long.
Coffee will be fine.

37
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:54,094
We leaving this weekend.
Deke got a friend in Mobile...

38
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:55,826
You gonna talk about that motherfucker,

39
00:03:55,934 --> 00:03:57,526
I'm just gonna get up
and leave you sitting here

40
00:03:57,636 --> 00:03:58,933
in that new shit he bought you.

41
00:03:59,037 --> 00:04:01,005
I thought we was gonna be friendly
about this.

42
00:04:01,106 --> 00:04:02,630
You sneaking around behind my back,

43
00:04:02,741 --> 00:04:05,539
got everybody in town
looking at me like I'm a fool.

44
00:04:05,644 --> 00:04:07,737
What's friendly about that?

45
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,948
I'm not ready to grow old, Laz.

46
00:04:11,049 --> 00:04:14,712
Living with you, I feel it.
Like I'm one foot in the dirt.

47
00:04:15,754 --> 00:04:18,723
Saw what happened to my mamma,
and that's not gonna happen to me.

48
00:04:18,824 --> 00:04:20,382
I got living to do.

49
00:04:20,492 --> 00:04:23,120
And you gonna do that living with him.

50
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,095
Look, Rose,

51
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:30,027
when folk get sick,
they do what they can

52
00:04:30,135 --> 00:04:32,035
to get on the mend, get well.

53
00:04:33,205 --> 00:04:35,366
Our marriage, it just done got sick.

54
00:04:35,474 --> 00:04:37,271
Don't talk to me about sick!

55
00:04:37,409 --> 00:04:40,105
I ain't been right
since I moved into that drafty house.

56
00:04:40,212 --> 00:04:41,474
Keeps the heat on.

57
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,310
That damn, rusty radiator
about burned the skin off my legs.

58
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:47,180
- Kept us warm for 12 years.
- Laz, you can't say nothing that's...

59
00:04:47,286 --> 00:04:49,516
Look, look, look.
Look, maybe we can do like R.L. said,

60
00:04:49,621 --> 00:04:51,714
come down to the church
and get with one of them counselors.

61
00:04:51,823 --> 00:04:53,518
I don't love you no more.

62
00:04:59,064 --> 00:05:00,895
I'm sorry you hurting.

63
00:05:02,434 --> 00:05:04,026
I said my piece.

64
00:05:06,672 --> 00:05:08,162
God forgive you
for what you done to me.

65
00:05:08,273 --> 00:05:09,297
Let me go.

66
00:05:09,408 --> 00:05:11,808
My daddy told me
a younger woman would bleed me dry,

67
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,036
and that's what you've done.

68
00:05:13,145 --> 00:05:16,080
- Laz, I said let...
- You better pray, gal.

69
00:05:16,181 --> 00:05:18,945
You hear me? You best pray.

70
00:05:19,051 --> 00:05:21,144
Don't you lay a curse on me!

71
00:05:22,688 --> 00:05:24,451
Yeah, go on, look.

72
00:05:24,556 --> 00:05:27,491
See if I give a shit
about any of you people!

73
00:05:45,744 --> 00:05:48,144
- You still want a lift?
- Yeah.

74
00:05:49,281 --> 00:05:51,044
Transmission's shot.

75
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:03,285
Hey.

76
00:06:04,796 --> 00:06:07,356
Make sure you go see my Aunt Lori.
You gotta get rid of that cough.

77
00:06:07,466 --> 00:06:09,024
This ain't gonna work.

78
00:06:09,668 --> 00:06:10,896
- Rae...
- I don't see why we gotta

79
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:13,028
pretend about it when you and I
both know it ain't gonna work.

80
00:06:13,138 --> 00:06:15,197
- Rae, please don't do this, okay?
- It's stupid!

81
00:06:15,307 --> 00:06:17,400
- Rae. Rae!
- It's so fucking stupid!

82
00:06:22,047 --> 00:06:25,141
Look it. I got something for us, okay?

83
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,877
Give me your hand.

84
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,781
Give me your hand.

85
00:06:31,823 --> 00:06:32,915
Look.

86
00:06:39,331 --> 00:06:40,355
See?

87
00:06:40,932 --> 00:06:45,096
Both these watches are gonna beep
at the same time, every night.

88
00:06:45,203 --> 00:06:49,435
So no matter how far away we are,
we'll be thinking about each other.

89
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:51,766
Hey, look at me.

90
00:06:52,778 --> 00:06:54,143
Look at me.

91
00:06:56,248 --> 00:07:00,082
I gotta believe we can do this,
or I ain't gonna make it.

92
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,978
Okay.

93
00:07:04,289 --> 00:07:05,881
God, I love you.

94
00:07:32,884 --> 00:07:34,442
Ronnie, wait!

95
00:07:36,888 --> 00:07:38,082
Ronnie!

96
00:08:21,066 --> 00:08:22,158
Fuck.

97
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,160
No, no.

98
00:08:57,636 --> 00:08:59,763
Hey, you got any money?

99
00:08:59,871 --> 00:09:01,668
Thought you had a man for that.

100
00:09:01,773 --> 00:09:03,638
I said we weren't gonna talk about him.

101
00:09:03,742 --> 00:09:05,835
How many times
we done done this shit?

102
00:09:05,944 --> 00:09:07,502
Look, I ain't calling you
no ho or nothing,

103
00:09:07,612 --> 00:09:09,603
but I ain't gonna let you
play me like no trick, neither.

104
00:09:09,714 --> 00:09:13,047
- Remember, you called me.
- Save it.

105
00:09:13,151 --> 00:09:15,915
Save it for those dumb fuckers
you sell crack to.

106
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,987
How much money you need, ho?

107
00:09:20,091 --> 00:09:21,581
The hell you call me?

108
00:09:24,763 --> 00:09:28,130
You wanna get rough, huh?
Is that what you doing?

109
00:09:29,167 --> 00:09:31,658
Tehronne. Tehronne, let me go.
Let me go!

110
00:09:44,049 --> 00:09:45,073
Bye.

111
00:10:29,728 --> 00:10:30,752
It's already noon, Rae.

112
00:10:30,862 --> 00:10:32,386
You think them shorts
should still be on?

113
00:10:32,497 --> 00:10:36,126
Well, if they weren't, you could
kiss my rebel cootch, you faggot.

114
00:10:40,872 --> 00:10:42,601
Cough drops or condoms?

115
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,537
I didn't know you was working here.

116
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,908
Yeah, well, you know how it is.

117
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:57,216
I just love getting dressed up
in these goddamn blue vests.

118
00:11:01,693 --> 00:11:04,355
Your meal ticket get shipped out today?

119
00:11:08,733 --> 00:11:11,497
Just let me know
if I can be of any assistance.

120
00:11:15,774 --> 00:11:18,334
Here you go, Linc.
Keep the change on that.

121
00:11:19,344 --> 00:11:20,606
Thanks, Mr. Laz.

122
00:11:20,712 --> 00:11:23,112
But if you wanna tip me,
best do it in butter beans.

123
00:11:23,214 --> 00:11:24,875
Mamma wants a bag of yours.

124
00:11:24,983 --> 00:11:27,247
"None of that store-bought junk."
That's what she said.

125
00:11:27,352 --> 00:11:29,252
All right, you keep the change anyhow.

126
00:11:29,354 --> 00:11:31,481
Come on out to the house,
I'll load you up.

127
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,818
Yes, sir.

128
00:12:38,256 --> 00:12:41,282
Why y'all stop having dances
on Saturday night?

129
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:44,362
You used to have live bands
and all kind of shit.

130
00:12:44,462 --> 00:12:46,157
Feels like a wake up in here now.

131
00:12:46,264 --> 00:12:50,223
Folks can dance if they want.
I didn't buy that mirror ball for nothing.

132
00:12:50,335 --> 00:12:52,860
Y'all seen my snakeskin shoes?

133
00:12:52,971 --> 00:12:55,303
- They from New York.
- Yeah.

134
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:57,637
My niece,
she gets them on the computer.

135
00:12:57,742 --> 00:13:00,609
- Is that right?
- They got blue snakes up north?

136
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,142
No. They got blue dye, though.

137
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:08,447
You think them boots on your feet
come from a black cow?

138
00:13:08,553 --> 00:13:11,215
You wanna get on somebody
about live music?

139
00:13:11,322 --> 00:13:13,051
Get on old Laz there.

140
00:13:13,158 --> 00:13:16,184
He the one who got this joint shaking
back in the day.

141
00:13:16,294 --> 00:13:18,228
You ain't gotta tell me.

142
00:13:18,329 --> 00:13:19,956
Me and my girlfriends,

143
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:23,159
we used to talk about
how hard his fingertips get

144
00:13:23,268 --> 00:13:25,566
just picking that guitar.

145
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:28,230
They hard from picking peas,
not strings.

146
00:13:28,339 --> 00:13:30,068
And they still hard.

147
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:36,242
Mayella, it ain't never happened.
It damn sure ain't gonna happen tonight.

148
00:13:36,347 --> 00:13:38,406
Oh, Laz, I know you hurting.

149
00:13:38,516 --> 00:13:40,484
But you should know more than me,

150
00:13:40,585 --> 00:13:44,419
ain't no better cure for the blues
than some good pussy.

151
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:56,533
Now that's a whole lot of woman
right there.

152
00:13:56,634 --> 00:13:57,726
Yeah.

153
00:13:57,836 --> 00:14:00,236
She sure do like to spread it around.

154
00:14:03,908 --> 00:14:05,136
Hey, Laz.

155
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,810
Me and you friends and all,

156
00:14:07,912 --> 00:14:11,348
but promise me
you'll keep your cool in my joint.

157
00:14:17,989 --> 00:14:20,787
- I'm gonna finish my beer.
- All right then.

158
00:14:24,696 --> 00:14:26,163
Mind if I sit?

159
00:14:33,671 --> 00:14:37,767
Rose said that
it didn't go too well this afternoon.

160
00:14:38,576 --> 00:14:40,771
See, I told her. I said, "Rose,

161
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:43,643
"we ain't leaving
till we make peace with Laz."

162
00:14:43,748 --> 00:14:46,478
And that's the God's truth. I laid it down.

163
00:14:46,584 --> 00:14:48,711
- You laid it down?
- I did.

164
00:14:49,354 --> 00:14:50,787
That's funny.

165
00:14:51,556 --> 00:14:54,024
You laying it down for my wife.

166
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:56,423
You think I wanna hurt you, Laz?

167
00:14:57,095 --> 00:14:59,893
- Man, I'd take a bullet for you!
- Would you now?

168
00:14:59,998 --> 00:15:02,296
We can put that to the test.

169
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:06,632
Say, Bo, would you still got that
little .22 over behind the bar?

170
00:15:06,738 --> 00:15:08,729
My little brother here say
he'd take a bullet for me.

171
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,274
All right now, slow your roll now.

172
00:15:13,945 --> 00:15:16,539
You come in here
to ease your heart, huh?

173
00:15:17,282 --> 00:15:19,682
Well, I ain't gonna help you do that.

174
00:15:19,784 --> 00:15:21,775
You took her into your bed,

175
00:15:23,488 --> 00:15:25,479
now you got to lay in it.

176
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:34,021
I'll always love you, Laz.

177
00:15:34,699 --> 00:15:36,428
Till the end of my days.

178
00:15:38,736 --> 00:15:41,204
- Laz, what you doing, man?
- Laz, God damn it!

179
00:15:41,306 --> 00:15:43,433
Cain slew Abel.

180
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,441
Slew him out of envy.

181
00:15:45,543 --> 00:15:48,410
God put his mark on Cain for his sins.

182
00:15:48,513 --> 00:15:51,676
Is that what you want, Deke?
Huh? Is that what you come here for?

183
00:15:51,783 --> 00:15:55,776
I'll do it for you.
All you got to do is say it again.

184
00:15:56,521 --> 00:15:58,079
Say you love me.

185
00:15:59,057 --> 00:16:00,922
Say you love me, nigger!

186
00:16:27,118 --> 00:16:29,416
- Ronnie ship out this morning?
- Yeah. He's so stupid.

187
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,487
Why do you think he's stupid?

188
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:33,284
He told me he don't want nothing to do
with no military career.

189
00:16:33,391 --> 00:16:37,293
He wants to go up in Knoxville,
start an auto body shop with his uncle.

190
00:16:37,395 --> 00:16:40,558
- I said, "Let's go! Let's do it now!"
- Really?

191
00:16:40,665 --> 00:16:44,032
Shit, Ronnie knows cars.
Fixed that Buick for my Uncle Dale.

192
00:16:44,135 --> 00:16:47,935
Then he starts talking all this shit
about honor and duty. I swear.

193
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:49,939
If he gets hurt up there,
I'm gonna kill him.

194
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:52,032
It's not like you're married.
He ain't even proposed.

195
00:16:52,143 --> 00:16:53,440
He don't give a shit about me.

196
00:16:53,544 --> 00:16:56,138
I begged him not to go.
I fucking begged him.

197
00:16:56,247 --> 00:16:57,714
Oh, my God!

198
00:17:07,325 --> 00:17:09,316
Hey, you all right?

199
00:17:09,427 --> 00:17:11,793
- Yeah. I'm okay.
- You wanna go home?

200
00:17:11,896 --> 00:17:15,354
No, it just gets worse there,
leaving me to my own head.

201
00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:26,902
- Better?
- Yeah.

202
00:17:27,011 --> 00:17:29,605
- Hey, Jess.
- Hey, Batson.

203
00:17:29,714 --> 00:17:31,773
You Robotripping tonight?

204
00:17:31,883 --> 00:17:34,010
No, but I will smoke that joint.

205
00:17:34,118 --> 00:17:37,383
Well, check this out.
I got eight packs of DXM.

206
00:17:37,488 --> 00:17:38,682
I got OxyContin.

207
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:42,487
I got a whole shitload of Coricidin
if you wanna get out-of-body and all.

208
00:17:42,593 --> 00:17:45,323
Coricidin? You're just trying to get me
out of my clothes.

209
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:47,796
- I'll be right back, okay?
- All right.

210
00:17:50,835 --> 00:17:53,804
- Hey.
- What you want?

211
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:58,065
Ain't no reason I can't go out
and have fun with my friends.

212
00:17:58,176 --> 00:18:00,667
What, you think
I'm Ronnie's spy or something?

213
00:18:01,646 --> 00:18:04,274
Come tomorrow, his dumb ass
gonna be halfway around the world

214
00:18:04,382 --> 00:18:06,976
trying to keep his head
on his shoulders.

215
00:18:07,418 --> 00:18:10,046
You think
he's gonna be thinking about you?

216
00:18:11,689 --> 00:18:13,179
You go to hell.

217
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:18,921
Hey, how many to get me fucked up?

218
00:19:57,128 --> 00:20:00,461
Just like a bird without a feather

219
00:20:05,403 --> 00:20:08,736
You know I'm lost without your love

220
00:20:13,811 --> 00:20:17,144
Just like a bird without a feather

221
00:20:21,886 --> 00:20:24,787
You know I'm lost without your love

222
00:20:29,594 --> 00:20:32,154
You know I need your lovin'

223
00:20:33,764 --> 00:20:37,063
Just like the angels need heaven above

224
00:20:45,109 --> 00:20:47,202
Well, I done shot that woman

225
00:20:50,548 --> 00:20:53,711
Shot her 'cause she done me wrong

226
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:04,825
Yeah, I love that woman

227
00:21:06,464 --> 00:21:09,729
Says she ain't love no one but me

228
00:21:17,842 --> 00:21:21,073
Yeah, but I caught that woman cheatin'

229
00:21:23,514 --> 00:21:26,711
Now our home ain't where it used to be

230
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:42,991
Jess!

231
00:21:46,437 --> 00:21:49,201
Jess! Jess!

232
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:57,272
Stop!

233
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:00,775
- Stop! Stop!
- Stop what?

234
00:22:00,885 --> 00:22:03,854
Stop. I'm spinning. Don't.

235
00:22:08,659 --> 00:22:11,184
Oh, God, that feels so much better.

236
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:28,107
Come on, I'll take you home.

237
00:22:42,126 --> 00:22:44,526
Thought you had
some shorts on earlier.

238
00:22:45,763 --> 00:22:47,230
I got others.

239
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,590
This thing you got...

240
00:22:56,107 --> 00:23:00,009
I've heard people say you'd fuck a tree
if it was handy. I can see that.

241
00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:04,573
But that nigger, Tehronne?

242
00:23:09,253 --> 00:23:10,948
He thinks he's some player

243
00:23:11,055 --> 00:23:14,183
'cause he hustles dope
and stolen hubcaps, I mean,

244
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:16,726
I can see a tree. But that piece of shit?

245
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:19,260
I begged him not to go.

246
00:23:20,965 --> 00:23:22,125
But he went.

247
00:23:22,233 --> 00:23:23,928
I begged him.

248
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:25,866
I bet you did.

249
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:28,564
Just had to get
that black cock up in you.

250
00:23:37,515 --> 00:23:38,982
That's not...

251
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,046
What the fuck you laughing at?

252
00:23:44,155 --> 00:23:46,953
You ain't got a half
of what Tehronne got.

253
00:23:49,627 --> 00:23:51,117
Not a half.

254
00:23:58,969 --> 00:24:00,129
Get up!

255
00:24:01,138 --> 00:24:02,730
I ain't playing!

256
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:07,639
You gotta open your goddamn eyes!
God damn it!

257
00:24:18,622 --> 00:24:20,089
Jesus Christ.

258
00:24:43,948 --> 00:24:45,677
Hey, man, wake up.

259
00:25:14,745 --> 00:25:16,770
- Lazarus.
- Bojo called.

260
00:25:17,481 --> 00:25:22,043
Said you got to see your brother
at the long end of a broken bottle.

261
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,247
What, you call to preach me
about turning the other cheek now?

262
00:25:26,357 --> 00:25:29,952
I think you did all right by God,
under the circumstances.

263
00:25:31,896 --> 00:25:35,229
Your people are here for you, Laz.
This is your home.

264
00:25:35,332 --> 00:25:37,800
Ain't no shame
in showing your face around here.

265
00:25:37,902 --> 00:25:39,460
Yeah, all right.

266
00:25:41,672 --> 00:25:42,798
Shit.

267
00:27:23,941 --> 00:27:25,169
Oh, shit!

268
00:27:44,428 --> 00:27:45,793
Little lady?

269
00:27:46,864 --> 00:27:48,764
Little lady, listen to me. Miss.

270
00:27:48,866 --> 00:27:52,199
Miss, now, I need you to open
your eyes for me, all right?

271
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:55,170
Come on now. Open your eyes.
Now, you can do that for me, can't you?

272
00:27:55,272 --> 00:27:57,263
Come on. Come on.

273
00:27:57,374 --> 00:27:59,205
There you go. Just like that.

274
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,402
That's good.

275
00:28:00,511 --> 00:28:02,172
- Tehronne.
- Huh?

276
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:04,804
- Tehronne.
- Tehronne?

277
00:28:05,816 --> 00:28:08,250
He did... He did... He didn't do this to...

278
00:28:11,155 --> 00:28:12,588
It's all right.

279
00:28:14,825 --> 00:28:18,727
I'm fixing to go to town and get
some medicines so I can fix you up.

280
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,889
You just rest, all right?

281
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:25,060
Just try to get some sleep.

282
00:28:25,936 --> 00:28:27,995
Take that chill off of you.

283
00:28:30,007 --> 00:28:31,235
God damn.

284
00:29:05,409 --> 00:29:08,845
- Lazarus?
- Miss Angie. You gave me a start.

285
00:29:08,946 --> 00:29:12,382
I'm sorry, it's these soft shoes
I wear for my back.

286
00:29:12,483 --> 00:29:14,781
- You hurt your back?
- No, no, I'm standing most of my day.

287
00:29:14,885 --> 00:29:16,785
They're just for support.

288
00:29:16,887 --> 00:29:18,878
Didn't see you in church this morning.

289
00:29:18,989 --> 00:29:22,618
Oh, I'm real busy with the crops.

290
00:29:22,726 --> 00:29:26,423
And if I don't work on Sunday,
then I have to hire some extra hands.

291
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:29,124
Well, it's good to see you.

292
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,692
Look here, Miss Angela,

293
00:29:32,569 --> 00:29:36,198
my little niece,
she got a real bad cough.

294
00:29:36,306 --> 00:29:39,002
- You take her to a doctor?
- No.

295
00:29:39,109 --> 00:29:42,078
She can't go...
Well, ain't no money for a doctor.

296
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:45,615
Her daddy off work
and he asked me to take care of her.

297
00:29:47,017 --> 00:29:49,315
I don't... I don't know what to do.

298
00:29:50,354 --> 00:29:51,878
You wait right here.

299
00:31:23,981 --> 00:31:26,745
Is your niece older than 12?

300
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:29,978
Okay. My sister got a bad cough
with her pneumonia

301
00:31:30,087 --> 00:31:31,520
so I just copied her prescription.

302
00:31:31,622 --> 00:31:34,591
You don t need to pay anything.
Just take it.

303
00:31:34,691 --> 00:31:37,455
And if she gets worse,
you give me a call.

304
00:31:37,561 --> 00:31:39,529
I put my number on the bottle.

305
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,234
You ain't gonna get into no trouble
about this, is you?

306
00:31:45,335 --> 00:31:47,132
Not if no one finds out.

307
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:07,251
Hey, Laz.
You know we closed on Sunday, man.

308
00:32:07,357 --> 00:32:09,416
I need to talk to Tehronne.

309
00:32:09,893 --> 00:32:11,224
Yo, T!

310
00:32:12,729 --> 00:32:14,822
Laz wanna holla at you, man.

311
00:32:15,299 --> 00:32:16,994
Come on back, Cuz.

312
00:32:18,769 --> 00:32:22,500
You call it a game
when one man wins each time?

313
00:32:24,174 --> 00:32:26,506
I call it a motherfucking shame.

314
00:32:27,945 --> 00:32:30,345
- What you want?
- Can I get a word?

315
00:32:32,416 --> 00:32:33,610
Come on.

316
00:32:42,125 --> 00:32:45,652
- You want some weed?
- No, man, I don't mess with that stuff.

317
00:32:47,097 --> 00:32:49,588
You know a white girl about yay high,

318
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:52,396
dirty blonde hair
split down the middle like?

319
00:32:52,502 --> 00:32:54,493
That ain't up to me to hook you up, pop.

320
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:56,573
- She on her own, you know?
- Huh?

321
00:32:56,673 --> 00:32:58,732
I don't pimp that.

322
00:32:58,842 --> 00:33:01,037
But if you talking about
who I think you talking about,

323
00:33:01,144 --> 00:33:03,806
you talking about Rae. Rae Doole.

324
00:33:04,648 --> 00:33:06,946
Sexy little split tail, like you say.

325
00:33:07,517 --> 00:33:11,078
Can't hook you up with that.
But I do got two ho.

326
00:33:11,188 --> 00:33:12,883
One of them ain't in town

327
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:15,857
and the other one pregnant,
so you on your own.

328
00:33:16,526 --> 00:33:19,256
Well, this Rae, you get with her?

329
00:33:19,363 --> 00:33:22,196
- Shit, man, who ain't fucked her?
- What you mean?

330
00:33:22,299 --> 00:33:25,666
Man, she got a spare minute,
she snatch up anybody.

331
00:33:25,769 --> 00:33:29,136
Sometime she needs the real deal,
so she calls me up.

332
00:33:29,806 --> 00:33:32,866
Girl got a itch, you know?
What's a nigger to do?

333
00:33:34,945 --> 00:33:38,403
Now this girl, Rae, she like it rough?

334
00:33:38,515 --> 00:33:40,073
You know, like beating on her
or whatnot?

335
00:33:40,183 --> 00:33:41,309
That ain't my scene.

336
00:33:41,418 --> 00:33:43,113
- That something you into?
- No.

337
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:46,121
See, look, nigger, that girl's in my favor.

338
00:33:46,223 --> 00:33:48,418
You fuck with her rough,
you got me to fuck with.

339
00:33:48,525 --> 00:33:51,392
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Collar that dog, boy.

340
00:33:51,495 --> 00:33:54,487
I don't wanna mess with her.
I just wanna know who she is, that's all.

341
00:33:54,598 --> 00:33:58,432
Like I say, you wanna hook up with that,
I ain't in your way.

342
00:33:58,535 --> 00:34:01,470
That switch of hers
been all over town anyway.

343
00:34:01,571 --> 00:34:04,438
- She got that sickness, you know?
- What sickness?

344
00:34:05,342 --> 00:34:09,836
What I'm saying is,
she gotta get dick or she goes crazy.

345
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:13,940
Get my money ready, nigger.

346
00:34:18,255 --> 00:34:19,347
Miss?

347
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:21,953
Miss Rae?

348
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,625
Hey! Hey, you hear me?

349
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:30,428
Come here. Come on.

350
00:34:31,435 --> 00:34:33,164
Come on now. Hey.

351
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:36,533
Oh, shit! You burning up!

352
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:40,167
Hey, listen to me.
Look me in the eye now. Come on.

353
00:34:40,277 --> 00:34:41,710
Look at me.

354
00:34:41,812 --> 00:34:44,645
See, ain't no harm here. Ain't no harm.

355
00:34:44,748 --> 00:34:46,716
All I wanna do is get you well.

356
00:34:47,551 --> 00:34:50,850
My name is Lazarus. Lazarus Redd.

357
00:34:50,954 --> 00:34:53,718
- Lazarus.
- That's right. My name is Lazarus.

358
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:55,382
- Lazarus Redd.
- Lazarus.

359
00:34:55,492 --> 00:34:58,655
And I'm gonna take good care of you,
all right? Okay?

360
00:35:06,036 --> 00:35:08,732
Lazarus! Lazarus!

361
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:10,867
Lazarus!

362
00:35:11,341 --> 00:35:13,605
Get off me! Get off me!

363
00:35:17,047 --> 00:35:19,914
See if I give a shit
about any of you people!

364
00:35:42,139 --> 00:35:45,438
Lazarus! Lazarus!

365
00:35:46,176 --> 00:35:48,144
Lazarus!

366
00:36:32,656 --> 00:36:35,250
I know. I know it hurts. I know it hurts!

367
00:36:35,358 --> 00:36:36,848
We gotta break that fever!

368
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,723
I ain't gonna let you die!

369
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:41,457
I ain't letting you die!

370
00:36:41,565 --> 00:36:43,032
Now breathe.

371
00:36:43,567 --> 00:36:46,331
Come on. Breathe now. Calm down.

372
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:51,433
There you go. You cooling off already.

373
00:36:51,942 --> 00:36:55,673
Girl, you put the fear of the devil in me.

374
00:36:56,279 --> 00:36:59,908
I was scared as a kid
on Halloween night in the graveyard.

375
00:37:23,006 --> 00:37:24,166
Ronnie?

376
00:37:31,414 --> 00:37:32,506
Ronnie?

377
00:37:35,352 --> 00:37:37,820
Ronnie, where did you go?
Where did you go?

378
00:37:39,089 --> 00:37:40,420
Where did you go?

379
00:37:41,258 --> 00:37:44,227
Where did you go, Ronnie?
Where did you go?

380
00:37:46,229 --> 00:37:47,389
Ronnie?

381
00:37:48,231 --> 00:37:49,425
Ronnie?

382
00:37:51,601 --> 00:37:54,161
Ronnie!

383
00:37:56,907 --> 00:37:58,670
Ronnie!

384
00:37:58,775 --> 00:38:00,367
Say, gal...

385
00:38:00,477 --> 00:38:01,535
Hey.

386
00:38:02,546 --> 00:38:04,776
Is you hearing the sound of my voice?

387
00:38:05,682 --> 00:38:07,582
You traveling now, girl.

388
00:38:08,552 --> 00:38:11,214
Why don't you come on back
in the house with me now?

389
00:38:11,321 --> 00:38:12,913
Come on now.

390
00:38:13,023 --> 00:38:14,115
Come on!

391
00:38:14,224 --> 00:38:16,784
Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey, you all right?

392
00:38:16,893 --> 00:38:20,920
Whoa, whoa, whoa now.
Come on. Hey, hey.

393
00:38:26,169 --> 00:38:28,797
It's all right. It's all right. It's all right.

394
00:38:28,905 --> 00:38:30,964
Come on. Come on.

395
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:35,837
You all right. You all right.

396
00:38:44,154 --> 00:38:47,123
It's all right now. It's okay.
Just rest, all right.

397
00:38:50,527 --> 00:38:51,824
It's okay.

398
00:38:53,363 --> 00:38:54,955
It's okay.

399
00:38:55,065 --> 00:38:56,828
- Oh, no, no, no.
- It's okay.

400
00:38:57,601 --> 00:39:00,661
Hey. Hey.
We ain't gonna do that, all right?

401
00:39:02,305 --> 00:39:05,138
Here you go, Rae. You're safe now.

402
00:39:06,443 --> 00:39:08,502
Listen. Listen. Listen here.

403
00:39:09,279 --> 00:39:11,144
I went

404
00:39:12,782 --> 00:39:15,273
Down to the church house

405
00:39:17,053 --> 00:39:19,078
I heard a voice

406
00:39:20,023 --> 00:39:22,253
Tell me to pray

407
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:26,185
I got down on my knees

408
00:39:27,063 --> 00:39:29,861
But I had no words to say

409
00:39:31,234 --> 00:39:33,327
No words to say

410
00:39:34,904 --> 00:39:37,065
You know I could not pray

411
00:40:41,471 --> 00:40:44,531
If I, I was a catfish

412
00:40:45,575 --> 00:40:48,476
Swimming, Lord, in the deep blue sea

413
00:40:49,245 --> 00:40:52,681
I'd have all you big leg women

414
00:40:52,782 --> 00:40:54,841
Fishing after me

415
00:40:54,951 --> 00:40:56,578
Fishing after me

416
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:04,587
Well, there's two, two trains runnin'

417
00:41:05,295 --> 00:41:07,923
They run, they run my way

418
00:41:08,565 --> 00:41:10,897
You know one run 'round midnight

419
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,560
The other run just 'fore day,
just 'fore day

420
00:41:14,337 --> 00:41:17,238
That train, Lord, took my baby away

421
00:41:17,974 --> 00:41:19,874
Took my baby away

422
00:42:16,132 --> 00:42:17,963
Whoa, whoa, whoa, now.

423
00:42:19,002 --> 00:42:21,232
Just take it easy. Don't go too fast.

424
00:42:21,905 --> 00:42:23,839
How long I been out?

425
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:27,034
You been in and out, I don't know,
I guess two days.

426
00:42:28,011 --> 00:42:29,137
Two days?

427
00:42:29,245 --> 00:42:31,805
Well, you wake up in spells, you know.

428
00:42:31,915 --> 00:42:34,850
Just long enough to get
some of this medicine in you.

429
00:42:35,952 --> 00:42:37,977
Can you turn that shit off?

430
00:42:38,755 --> 00:42:40,017
Oh, yeah.

431
00:42:46,729 --> 00:42:49,197
Found you out by the side of the road.

432
00:42:49,299 --> 00:42:52,530
Looked like somebody
took to beating on you pretty bad.

433
00:42:52,635 --> 00:42:55,069
You know who done that to you?

434
00:42:55,171 --> 00:42:57,696
- Where's Ronnie?
- I don't know who that is.

435
00:42:57,807 --> 00:43:00,207
No, wait, wait. He left.

436
00:43:05,114 --> 00:43:08,914
I don't got any money or anything,
you know, for fixing me up.

437
00:43:09,018 --> 00:43:10,918
I don't need none.

438
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:13,250
I guess I best be on my way.

439
00:43:13,356 --> 00:43:16,553
- I think we need to talk some.
- No, sir.

440
00:43:16,659 --> 00:43:17,785
I gotta be on my way.

441
00:43:17,894 --> 00:43:20,328
Best to get your wits about you before...

442
00:43:23,933 --> 00:43:25,924
I wanted to tell you about that.

443
00:43:27,003 --> 00:43:28,903
Why you got me chained?

444
00:43:38,681 --> 00:43:40,239
What the fuck you been doing to me?

445
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:42,784
I ain't laid a hand on you,
except to break your fever.

446
00:43:42,886 --> 00:43:45,116
- Like I said...
- Get this goddamn chain off me!

447
00:43:45,221 --> 00:43:47,883
Look, girl, you been running wild on me!

448
00:43:47,991 --> 00:43:50,482
Between them fits
and them fever dreams you having,

449
00:43:50,593 --> 00:43:52,424
I been chasing you
all over this place at night.

450
00:43:52,529 --> 00:43:54,963
Well, I'm woke now.
You can take this off.

451
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:00,264
No. You ain't right yet.

452
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:03,100
I'm right enough
to stand on my own two feet.

453
00:44:03,206 --> 00:44:05,606
Now get this goddamn chain off me!

454
00:44:07,076 --> 00:44:09,670
Why you let them mens
treat you like that?

455
00:44:10,914 --> 00:44:11,972
What?

456
00:44:12,081 --> 00:44:15,517
All them mens you up under,
why you let them do you like that?

457
00:44:18,488 --> 00:44:20,479
What the hell you know about me?

458
00:44:21,658 --> 00:44:23,683
You ain't got no right
to talk to me about that shit!

459
00:44:23,793 --> 00:44:26,193
- Who the fuck do you think you are?
- I saved your life, girl!

460
00:44:26,296 --> 00:44:29,094
I can do or say whatever the fuck I want!

461
00:44:30,767 --> 00:44:33,759
Now, I done give you enough chain
so you can get around the house here.

462
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:36,862
You can get to the kitchen.
Bathroom, back yonder.

463
00:44:36,973 --> 00:44:38,634
You got enough food around here.

464
00:44:38,741 --> 00:44:41,733
A few more swallows left
in that medicine over there.

465
00:44:41,844 --> 00:44:46,611
Whatever you want, you know,
if you wanna have me, you can take me.

466
00:44:46,716 --> 00:44:51,449
I'll do whatever you like.
Just, when you're done, I gotta go.

467
00:44:51,554 --> 00:44:55,012
You know?
'Cause I can't stay here with you.

468
00:44:55,124 --> 00:44:58,423
God seen fit to put you in my path.

469
00:44:59,529 --> 00:45:02,760
And I aim to cure you
of your wickedness.

470
00:45:06,669 --> 00:45:09,638
- You some kind of pervert?
- No, ma'am.

471
00:45:09,739 --> 00:45:12,139
Some crazy Jesus freak,
gonna fuck the spirit into me?

472
00:45:12,241 --> 00:45:14,402
You watch your tongue in my house!

473
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:16,341
- Look it, mister...
- Now, you sick!

474
00:45:16,446 --> 00:45:18,710
- You got a sickness!
- Look it, mister...

475
00:45:18,815 --> 00:45:20,908
- We done broke the fever.
- I will do whatever you want.

476
00:45:21,017 --> 00:45:23,212
Now, we gonna break the hold
the devil got on you!

477
00:45:23,319 --> 00:45:25,651
I can't stay here! I can't stay here!

478
00:45:28,224 --> 00:45:29,350
Help!

479
00:45:38,601 --> 00:45:40,569
Somebody help me!

480
00:45:59,255 --> 00:46:01,246
We ain't gonna be moved.

481
00:46:08,097 --> 00:46:09,894
Listen here, gal.

482
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:12,999
I ain't gonna be moved on this.

483
00:46:15,905 --> 00:46:17,133
Help!

484
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:22,071
Let me go!

485
00:46:22,178 --> 00:46:25,443
You can holler all you want.
Ain't nobody gonna hear you.

486
00:46:25,548 --> 00:46:27,641
Ain't gonna bend my will, neither.

487
00:46:28,251 --> 00:46:29,582
Right or wrong,

488
00:46:31,521 --> 00:46:32,954
you gonna mind me.

489
00:46:33,056 --> 00:46:36,116
Like Jesus says, I'm gonna suffer you.

490
00:46:36,225 --> 00:46:37,852
I'm gonna suffer you!

491
00:46:38,928 --> 00:46:41,158
Get your ass back in my house!

492
00:46:45,435 --> 00:46:46,629
Or what?

493
00:46:48,838 --> 00:46:50,066
Or what?

494
00:47:15,798 --> 00:47:18,965
- Quit it! It hurts!
- Now, whose doing is that?

495
00:47:29,378 --> 00:47:31,437
God damn it! Okay!

496
00:47:41,657 --> 00:47:43,022
You hungry?

497
00:47:55,304 --> 00:47:58,171
I put a lot of backache
into growing them greens.

498
00:47:59,242 --> 00:48:01,506
Some love into cooking the rest of it.

499
00:48:02,378 --> 00:48:04,903
If you slow down,
you might taste some of it.

500
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:25,492
Oh, you like this?

501
00:48:25,601 --> 00:48:28,069
Walking me through this field all day
like I was your mule?

502
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:30,298
Can't lay around on the sofa all day.

503
00:48:30,406 --> 00:48:32,271
Gotta get your legs strong.

504
00:48:32,375 --> 00:48:35,003
If I break one, you gonna shoot me?

505
00:48:54,864 --> 00:48:57,628
My daddy was one of the first mens
in these parts

506
00:48:57,733 --> 00:49:00,463
to start a soil conservation group.

507
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:04,870
They got a group of farmers together,
every year they rotate the crops.

508
00:49:05,875 --> 00:49:07,706
Know why they do that?

509
00:49:08,778 --> 00:49:10,643
Keep the soil healthy.

510
00:49:11,914 --> 00:49:14,280
- That sting?
- Itches.

511
00:49:14,383 --> 00:49:16,248
That mean it's healing.

512
00:49:18,988 --> 00:49:23,925
Now, I done seen it in nature
and I done seen it in men.

513
00:49:25,228 --> 00:49:28,720
You gots to change, rotate the crop.

514
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:31,732
Gotta have change,
else that seed won't take.

515
00:49:31,834 --> 00:49:34,064
Hell, girl, you gotta cut that shit out.

516
00:49:34,170 --> 00:49:36,297
Laying up under all them fools,

517
00:49:36,405 --> 00:49:38,600
rutting on you
like you some bitch in heat,

518
00:49:38,708 --> 00:49:40,335
like you somebody's dog.

519
00:49:40,443 --> 00:49:45,437
A man or woman
that enters into union with Almighty God

520
00:49:45,548 --> 00:49:47,140
in the sanctity of marriage,

521
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:50,947
should not demean theyselves
by bending to another's will.

522
00:49:51,053 --> 00:49:52,884
Hell, girl, is you crazy?

523
00:49:52,989 --> 00:49:56,015
I ain't no saint. I ain't saying I ain't weak.

524
00:49:56,125 --> 00:49:59,686
I mean, playing guitar
in them blood-bucket jukes all your life,

525
00:49:59,795 --> 00:50:01,092
a nigger learn how to sin.

526
00:50:01,197 --> 00:50:04,223
And I do got sin in me.
I ain't gonna lie about that.

527
00:50:04,333 --> 00:50:06,028
But I got respect!

528
00:50:06,135 --> 00:50:08,831
And all you got in you is bile!
Just bile!

529
00:50:08,938 --> 00:50:11,873
Running around behind my back,
whoring with my brother!

530
00:50:11,974 --> 00:50:13,942
- Killing my baby!
- Get off!

531
00:50:31,894 --> 00:50:34,294
I didn't mean to go off like that.

532
00:50:36,799 --> 00:50:39,563
Why you old men gotta talk so much?

533
00:50:39,669 --> 00:50:42,297
You gotta talk yourself into fucking me?

534
00:50:42,405 --> 00:50:43,997
Like little boys.

535
00:50:45,474 --> 00:50:48,443
It's okay. I'm grown. I know.

536
00:50:49,512 --> 00:50:51,036
We can go slow.

537
00:50:53,916 --> 00:50:56,214
You gonna give me another bath?

538
00:52:57,239 --> 00:53:00,106
Well, Archie, there goes our fortune.

539
00:53:00,208 --> 00:53:03,268
Laz, we've been doing good
since you been away.

540
00:53:06,147 --> 00:53:08,342
What time Ella Mae's open up?

541
00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:10,884
You needing to buy some pantyhose?

542
00:53:11,853 --> 00:53:13,946
Couple of dresses, actually.

543
00:53:34,142 --> 00:53:37,407
- May I help you, sir?
- Yessum.

544
00:53:37,512 --> 00:53:41,107
I'm looking to get some things
for a woman.

545
00:53:41,216 --> 00:53:45,778
You know, some dresses and such
and maybe some shoes.

546
00:53:45,887 --> 00:53:50,051
But they gotta be nice things,
you know, proper things for a woman.

547
00:53:50,158 --> 00:53:53,321
You know, things that make a woman
feel like a woman

548
00:53:53,428 --> 00:53:56,761
and not look like a hussy or a floozy.

549
00:53:58,366 --> 00:54:00,732
Well, that makes it easier.

550
00:54:17,285 --> 00:54:18,547
Hello?

551
00:54:20,188 --> 00:54:21,280
Hey!

552
00:54:23,391 --> 00:54:24,619
Asshole.

553
00:54:59,561 --> 00:55:02,189
I just wanted to bring something
to show my appreciation.

554
00:55:02,297 --> 00:55:05,164
Some squash, tomatoes,
corn, butter beans.

555
00:55:05,266 --> 00:55:06,893
Oh, you didn't have to do that.

556
00:55:07,001 --> 00:55:09,765
Well, my niece is all better now,
thanks to you.

557
00:55:09,871 --> 00:55:11,964
That's good. I'm happy to hear it.

558
00:55:12,073 --> 00:55:15,133
Oh, and I put something special in here.

559
00:55:15,977 --> 00:55:18,673
This whipped body cream.
Got a scent to it.

560
00:55:21,983 --> 00:55:24,213
That there is ginger soufflé.

561
00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:28,915
Say, you put it on
after a hot bath or shower,

562
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:32,151
it'll make you soft, smell good.

563
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:34,285
That's real sweet of you.

564
00:55:34,396 --> 00:55:36,887
Just hope you enjoy it.

565
00:55:36,998 --> 00:55:38,363
Thank you.

566
00:55:49,110 --> 00:55:50,236
Mr. Lazarus!

567
00:55:53,681 --> 00:55:54,978
Hey, Mr. Laz!

568
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:01,546
I come for the butter beans!

569
00:56:10,832 --> 00:56:12,060
Mr. Laz?

570
00:56:42,363 --> 00:56:43,921
Mr. Laz, you in there?

571
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:47,154
Mr. Laz!

572
00:57:48,429 --> 00:57:50,192
I'm coming inside!

573
00:58:26,367 --> 00:58:28,028
There now! Hush up!

574
00:58:37,645 --> 00:58:41,081
God damn! Girl, I can't leave you alone
for a minute!

575
00:58:41,182 --> 00:58:43,582
Get your ass away from around here!

576
00:58:46,854 --> 00:58:48,719
Lincoln. Lincoln!

577
00:58:58,299 --> 00:59:00,893
Was that Lincoln James
I seen running off?

578
00:59:03,471 --> 00:59:05,234
Why his britches down
around his knees?

579
00:59:06,641 --> 00:59:08,199
R.L., you gonna have to get on.

580
00:59:09,644 --> 00:59:11,839
Can't have nobody around my place.

581
00:59:11,946 --> 00:59:13,880
You get a call from Rose?

582
00:59:13,982 --> 00:59:15,472
This ain't got nothing to do
with that woman.

583
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:17,778
I just don't wanna be bothered
with nobody right now.

584
00:59:17,885 --> 00:59:21,616
Something wrong with your phone?
I been trying to call you for a few days.

585
00:59:21,723 --> 00:59:23,384
Going dove hunting?

586
00:59:23,491 --> 00:59:27,018
R.L., now I done told you to get on.
I ain't playing.

587
00:59:33,034 --> 00:59:35,832
You saying that gun is for me if I don't.

588
00:59:35,937 --> 00:59:39,100
I ain't letting you
talk me out of shit no more, R.L.

589
00:59:39,207 --> 00:59:42,404
I done made up my mind on this,
I ain't gonna be moved.

590
00:59:43,478 --> 00:59:44,502
"Ain't gonna be moved."

591
00:59:44,612 --> 00:59:46,978
There ain't no room
for preaching around here no more!

592
00:59:47,081 --> 00:59:48,639
Now, I done told you to get on!

593
00:59:48,750 --> 00:59:50,377
- Or what?
- Go on now!

594
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:54,445
Go on. Shoot me.

595
00:59:55,189 --> 00:59:56,679
Shoot me, killer.

596
00:59:59,961 --> 01:00:02,930
I ought to stomp your ass,
pointing this thing at me.

597
01:00:06,034 --> 01:00:07,524
Damn it, Laz.

598
01:00:07,635 --> 01:00:10,126
I know we ain't blood,
but we was raised like brothers,

599
01:00:10,238 --> 01:00:12,798
since the very first day
we was slapped on the ass.

600
01:00:12,907 --> 01:00:15,034
Now you gonna go point a gun at me?

601
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:24,350
If you were in some kind of trouble,
then we gonna figure something out.

602
01:00:24,452 --> 01:00:25,942
You and me.

603
01:00:29,957 --> 01:00:32,425
Here. Go on, wipe your face off.

604
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:41,768
This got something to do with Rose?

605
01:00:44,138 --> 01:00:45,400
Then what?

606
01:00:56,317 --> 01:00:58,012
I didn't wanna do it.

607
01:01:07,295 --> 01:01:09,559
Are you out of your goddamn mind?

608
01:01:09,664 --> 01:01:10,892
Man in your line of work

609
01:01:10,998 --> 01:01:13,694
ought to not use the Lord's name in vain
like you just did.

610
01:01:13,801 --> 01:01:15,769
A half-naked white woman
chained up in your house!

611
01:01:15,870 --> 01:01:19,897
Now look here, I found that girl beat on
and left for dead out on the road!

612
01:01:20,007 --> 01:01:21,474
I just brung her home!

613
01:01:21,576 --> 01:01:23,271
Laz, I know that girl!

614
01:01:23,377 --> 01:01:27,336
She had a whole mess of crabs
and STDs! What you thinking?

615
01:01:27,448 --> 01:01:31,077
I swear on my mamma's grave, R.L.,
I ain't touched that girl.

616
01:01:31,185 --> 01:01:32,777
My wick dry on this.

617
01:01:39,427 --> 01:01:42,396
You say she was beat on.
You call the Sheriff on this?

618
01:01:42,497 --> 01:01:46,263
R.L., now put yourself in my place.

619
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:48,927
You out here by yourself with,
as you say,

620
01:01:49,036 --> 01:01:52,233
a half-naked white woman
who love to fuck.

621
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:55,241
Now, I done been toe to toe
with the law in this town a heap of times

622
01:01:55,343 --> 01:01:57,334
just for being black and nearby.

623
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:02,681
- What's that chain around her waist for?
- Go on in there and ask her.

624
01:02:03,518 --> 01:02:07,113
Now this girl been rut on
and beat on all her days.

625
01:02:07,221 --> 01:02:10,452
She need to talk to somebody
with some sense and some reasoning.

626
01:02:10,558 --> 01:02:11,752
That's you.

627
01:02:12,727 --> 01:02:14,888
Just go in there and talk to her.

628
01:02:16,898 --> 01:02:18,058
Please.

629
01:02:23,838 --> 01:02:25,863
And I'm fixing steaks for supper.

630
01:02:27,108 --> 01:02:28,837
I expect you to stay.

631
01:02:28,943 --> 01:02:32,902
You expect me to sit down and eat with
that woman chained up the way she is?

632
01:02:33,014 --> 01:02:35,608
R.L., you watch yourself in there.

633
01:02:36,317 --> 01:02:38,945
That gal be on your dick
like stank on shit.

634
01:02:46,694 --> 01:02:47,888
Lincoln.

635
01:02:48,563 --> 01:02:50,690
Come here, boy. Come on.

636
01:02:52,233 --> 01:02:55,168
- I ain't hurt you none, did I?
- No, sir.

637
01:02:56,070 --> 01:02:57,367
Look here.

638
01:02:58,272 --> 01:03:02,368
What happened up yonder at the house,
that wasn't your fault.

639
01:03:02,476 --> 01:03:04,876
Ain't a young man alive
could've kept his pants on

640
01:03:04,979 --> 01:03:07,379
with that girl in heat like she is.

641
01:03:07,481 --> 01:03:09,210
Why she got a chain on her?

642
01:03:09,317 --> 01:03:12,878
Well, now, that's between me and her,
that's private.

643
01:03:14,555 --> 01:03:15,579
So,

644
01:03:17,592 --> 01:03:20,152
- that your first time?
- Yes, sir.

645
01:03:20,995 --> 01:03:23,987
Shit! I remember my first time

646
01:03:24,098 --> 01:03:26,999
was out behind my uncle's barn
with my second cousin.

647
01:03:28,569 --> 01:03:32,699
Man, that girl must've weighed two tons
if she weighed a pound.

648
01:03:32,807 --> 01:03:35,332
Could've done a lot better for myself.

649
01:03:35,443 --> 01:03:38,037
Hell, look like you sure enough did.

650
01:03:40,948 --> 01:03:43,280
- You want a cigarette?
- No, sir.

651
01:03:43,784 --> 01:03:45,979
That's usually what you do
when you get through, you know.

652
01:03:46,087 --> 01:03:48,351
You either smoke
or leave them smoking.

653
01:03:53,961 --> 01:03:56,691
- You a preacher?
- That's right.

654
01:03:58,499 --> 01:04:00,194
Can I ask you a question?

655
01:04:02,937 --> 01:04:06,134
You know how people are always
saying, you gotta get right with Jesus

656
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:08,071
if you want not to go to hell, you know.

657
01:04:08,209 --> 01:04:12,236
Gotta say you're sorry
and Jesus will let you into heaven.

658
01:04:13,581 --> 01:04:15,640
You can put it that way.

659
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:17,843
That's so fucking stupid.

660
01:04:17,952 --> 01:04:20,944
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I don't mean to curse. I just...

661
01:04:21,055 --> 01:04:24,047
No, no, no. What's on your mind?
What's on your mind?

662
01:04:25,993 --> 01:04:28,962
You can't go around hurting people
and then just

663
01:04:29,063 --> 01:04:31,725
say you're sorry
and it all gets washed away.

664
01:04:33,034 --> 01:04:35,298
Why would heaven
want people like that?

665
01:04:41,809 --> 01:04:43,333
I'm gonna tell you something,

666
01:04:43,444 --> 01:04:46,504
and it's just gonna be
between you and me.

667
01:04:46,614 --> 01:04:49,845
I think folks
carry on about heaven too much.

668
01:04:49,951 --> 01:04:53,910
Like it's some kind of
all-you-can-eat buffet up in the clouds,

669
01:04:54,021 --> 01:04:56,148
and folks just do as they're told

670
01:04:56,257 --> 01:04:59,351
so they can eat what they want
behind some pearly gates.

671
01:05:06,233 --> 01:05:08,201
There's sin in my heart.

672
01:05:10,037 --> 01:05:12,198
There's evil in the world.

673
01:05:12,306 --> 01:05:16,208
But when I got no one, I talk to God.

674
01:05:18,112 --> 01:05:20,171
I ask for strength.

675
01:05:20,281 --> 01:05:22,215
I ask for forgiveness.

676
01:05:22,316 --> 01:05:25,683
Not peace at the end of my days
when I got no more life to live

677
01:05:25,786 --> 01:05:28,254
or no more good to do, but today.

678
01:05:29,657 --> 01:05:30,988
Right now.

679
01:05:36,030 --> 01:05:37,725
What's your heaven?

680
01:05:43,537 --> 01:05:44,697
Ronnie.

681
01:06:17,838 --> 01:06:19,328
Holy shit.

682
01:06:26,380 --> 01:06:29,349
Hey, Jim, let's get Ronnie set up here.

683
01:06:32,420 --> 01:06:33,387
Thank you.

684
01:06:35,656 --> 01:06:36,918
Hey, Herman.

685
01:06:37,558 --> 01:06:40,618
Hey, Ronnie.
They buy you that Big Chicken Dinner?

686
01:06:43,397 --> 01:06:44,625
The what?

687
01:06:45,066 --> 01:06:47,660
They got different names
for things in the Corps

688
01:06:47,768 --> 01:06:49,633
when they trying to get rid of you.

689
01:06:49,737 --> 01:06:51,500
I don't know what it's like in the Guard,

690
01:06:51,605 --> 01:06:56,406
but there's a thing called the
Bad Conduct Discharge, a BCD.

691
01:06:56,510 --> 01:06:59,445
It's not the same as the brig,
but it'll sure fuck you up for life

692
01:06:59,547 --> 01:07:02,345
if you ever wanna work
for the government.

693
01:07:02,450 --> 01:07:04,543
How do you get one of them deals?

694
01:07:04,652 --> 01:07:07,148
Well, blowing boys in the head...

695
01:07:07,254 --> 01:07:08,846
Whoa, whoa, whoa, son!

696
01:07:08,956 --> 01:07:11,015
I ain't saying shit about you.
I'm just talking.

697
01:07:11,125 --> 01:07:13,650
You don't know what you're
talking about, so shut the fuck up!

698
01:07:13,761 --> 01:07:15,661
All right, man. All right! It's all right!

699
01:07:15,763 --> 01:07:18,960
Hey, Herman. Come on, man.
He just got back. Shit.

700
01:07:19,066 --> 01:07:21,500
To get back
he had to have gone somewhere.

701
01:07:21,602 --> 01:07:23,297
- Fuck you!
- All right, man.

702
01:07:25,339 --> 01:07:27,933
- Come on, sit down.
- God damn it.

703
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:40,947
So what happened?

704
01:07:44,125 --> 01:07:47,492
They been keeping a folder on me
'cause of my stomach.

705
01:07:48,395 --> 01:07:51,660
Like how I used to get before games
back in school.

706
01:07:54,034 --> 01:07:55,501
I can't shoot.

707
01:07:56,437 --> 01:07:58,632
I mean, target practice, I'm a pro.

708
01:07:58,739 --> 01:08:01,207
I can tag
right between the numbers, but...

709
01:08:05,146 --> 01:08:08,809
Something happens
when I get around loud noises.

710
01:08:09,717 --> 01:08:13,585
I get shaky and start to lose my breath.

711
01:08:16,056 --> 01:08:17,956
They called it anxiety.

712
01:08:18,626 --> 01:08:20,150
Severe anxiety.

713
01:08:23,164 --> 01:08:25,189
Anyway, they sent me home.

714
01:08:29,737 --> 01:08:33,138
I guess it could be worse.
Could be coming back in a body bag.

715
01:08:33,941 --> 01:08:36,171
Hey, I can't get Rae on the phone.

716
01:08:37,578 --> 01:08:39,773
I mean, I called, she's not at home.

717
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:41,609
None of her friends
seem to know where she is.

718
01:08:41,715 --> 01:08:42,773
She's around.

719
01:08:42,883 --> 01:08:43,941
Always is.

720
01:08:44,051 --> 01:08:46,144
I don't know. I just feel like
something bad's happened.

721
01:08:46,253 --> 01:08:49,051
You'd tell me
if you knew something, right?

722
01:08:56,363 --> 01:08:59,890
Now that's sharp. That is sharp.

723
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,059
You ain't had no trouble with that chain,
did you?

724
01:09:02,169 --> 01:09:03,193
No.

725
01:09:06,907 --> 01:09:09,842
Well, steaks is on.

726
01:09:10,744 --> 01:09:12,735
Potatoes is boiling.

727
01:09:12,846 --> 01:09:15,576
R.L. and Lincoln are out there
grilling the corn.

728
01:09:15,683 --> 01:09:18,345
I'm about to throw these biscuits
in the oven.

729
01:09:18,452 --> 01:09:21,615
- What you know how to fix?
- I don't fucking cook.

730
01:09:21,722 --> 01:09:25,852
You know, Rae, I known a whole bunch
of hard-cussing people in my day...

731
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:29,555
All right, all right. Now, look.
I put the goddamn dress on, okay?

732
01:09:29,663 --> 01:09:32,131
I think I'm handling myself
with a little bit of fucking restraint,

733
01:09:32,233 --> 01:09:34,724
how you got me chained up here
like I'm some kind of dog!

734
01:09:34,835 --> 01:09:36,063
Rae. Rae!

735
01:09:37,137 --> 01:09:39,037
I ain't arguing with you.

736
01:09:39,139 --> 01:09:43,075
All I'm saying is
I know you got more in you than filth.

737
01:09:45,913 --> 01:09:48,746
- You saying you can't cook nothing?
- No.

738
01:09:50,985 --> 01:09:54,944
- Can you boil water?
- I think I can handle that.

739
01:09:55,089 --> 01:09:57,853
All right. Get to handling it.

740
01:10:04,765 --> 01:10:08,132
- We gonna eat with her?
- That's what I'm told.

741
01:10:11,572 --> 01:10:15,201
- She still gonna have that chain on?
- Well, I'm working on that.

742
01:10:16,877 --> 01:10:19,573
We ask you to bless this meal
put before us.

743
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:21,511
May this food nourish our bodies

744
01:10:21,615 --> 01:10:23,708
and may the fellowship
nourish our spirit.

745
01:10:23,817 --> 01:10:26,183
In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

746
01:10:26,287 --> 01:10:27,515
Amen.

747
01:10:28,422 --> 01:10:31,220
Y'all let me know
if these steaks is too dry, all right?

748
01:10:31,325 --> 01:10:34,419
And don't be shy now.
Got plenty over here.

749
01:10:34,528 --> 01:10:37,725
- This all looks wonderful.
- I skipped lunch today.

750
01:10:41,402 --> 01:10:44,838
These eggs got a little kick to them.
What you put in this?

751
01:10:44,938 --> 01:10:47,964
I expect you need to ask the chef here.

752
01:10:48,075 --> 01:10:49,565
Cayenne pepper.

753
01:11:05,459 --> 01:11:06,517
Rae?

754
01:11:08,696 --> 01:11:09,856
Rae?

755
01:11:23,177 --> 01:11:24,872
Kitchen looks just like I left it.

756
01:11:24,978 --> 01:11:27,310
She ever tell you
she was thinking of taking off?

757
01:11:27,414 --> 01:11:30,212
You know how she gets!
With her history...

758
01:11:31,418 --> 01:11:32,646
God damn!

759
01:11:36,757 --> 01:11:39,658
I guess I could see
how she could get scared.

760
01:11:45,699 --> 01:11:47,462
All right. All right, man.

761
01:11:48,235 --> 01:11:49,532
Sit down.

762
01:12:00,514 --> 01:12:03,483
Her mamma works down
at the grocery down on the square.

763
01:12:03,584 --> 01:12:05,814
- Hell, maybe she's seen her.
- Ronnie.

764
01:12:05,919 --> 01:12:08,581
You can't see it
'cause you're too close to it.

765
01:12:09,590 --> 01:12:13,082
Anxiety spells you get,
you never had that shit back in school.

766
01:12:13,193 --> 01:12:15,320
- That's not true...
- You joined up in that monkey troop

767
01:12:15,429 --> 01:12:17,420
'cause you had a plan for yourself!

768
01:12:17,531 --> 01:12:20,295
Army's gonna pay for school.
Gonna get yourself a degree.

769
01:12:20,401 --> 01:12:22,232
Maybe something in business
or agriculture.

770
01:12:22,336 --> 01:12:23,894
You were gonna
make something of yourself.

771
01:12:24,004 --> 01:12:27,440
Then you had to go and fall in love
with the school slut.

772
01:12:27,541 --> 01:12:30,135
Hey, I know about how she was like.

773
01:12:30,844 --> 01:12:33,540
Hey, I was the only one
she talked to about it.

774
01:12:33,647 --> 01:12:35,342
How she was abused.

775
01:12:37,418 --> 01:12:39,045
- Terrible things, Gill.
- Bullshit.

776
01:12:39,153 --> 01:12:41,087
Terrible things. Things you
don't even wanna know about.

777
01:12:41,188 --> 01:12:42,655
You had a plan!

778
01:12:43,190 --> 01:12:46,023
You had a goddamn life
and she just fucked the guts out of you!

779
01:12:46,126 --> 01:12:48,560
She had to take care of me
the whole time!

780
01:12:50,230 --> 01:12:53,324
Shit, I'd start throwing up, choking!

781
01:12:56,069 --> 01:12:59,095
And I got better. You know?

782
01:13:00,741 --> 01:13:04,472
And since we been together
she put all that junk behind her.

783
01:13:05,712 --> 01:13:07,373
She been faithful.

784
01:13:20,394 --> 01:13:22,089
First weekend away,

785
01:13:23,163 --> 01:13:26,064
when you was off playing soldier
on Saturdays,

786
01:13:26,166 --> 01:13:29,602
I come over, drop off spare keys
like you want me to.

787
01:13:30,471 --> 01:13:33,065
You weren't gone two hours

788
01:13:35,175 --> 01:13:38,008
and she was aching
to get me inside of her.

789
01:13:38,879 --> 01:13:42,542
I mean, every time you leave town,
that pussy's up for grabs.

790
01:13:42,649 --> 01:13:44,116
You're a liar.

791
01:13:46,286 --> 01:13:47,753
Is that right?

792
01:13:48,889 --> 01:13:52,791
Don't you think it's funny how I know
where everything in your house is?

793
01:13:56,230 --> 01:13:59,324
I don't care if that hurts you or not.
I really don't.

794
01:14:03,103 --> 01:14:04,297
Truth is

795
01:14:06,273 --> 01:14:08,906
I don't even know who you are anymore.

796
01:14:10,644 --> 01:14:13,477
So fuck it.

797
01:14:55,422 --> 01:14:58,448
- You gonna steal my truck now?
- Make yourself at home.

798
01:14:59,293 --> 01:15:01,090
You've done it already.

799
01:15:16,977 --> 01:15:19,537
- You take it straight?
- Sure.

800
01:15:31,124 --> 01:15:32,250
Jesus!

801
01:15:35,162 --> 01:15:37,289
- You want another one?
- Sure.

802
01:15:38,498 --> 01:15:40,466
We drinking buddies now?

803
01:15:44,137 --> 01:15:45,661
To

804
01:15:51,345 --> 01:15:52,539
freedom.

805
01:15:53,780 --> 01:15:55,475
Still making jokes.

806
01:15:59,353 --> 01:16:01,082
This ain't no joke.

807
01:16:02,789 --> 01:16:04,120
Come here.

808
01:16:10,497 --> 01:16:13,898
It ain't on me to change your life
or nobody else's.

809
01:16:16,036 --> 01:16:20,029
Shit. People gonna do
what the hell they wanna do anyway.

810
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:28,539
You ain't got but one life.

811
01:16:29,683 --> 01:16:32,277
You ought to live it the way you want.

812
01:16:43,463 --> 01:16:46,330
I can take you back to town now
if you want.

813
01:16:50,437 --> 01:16:51,461
Laz,

814
01:16:53,273 --> 01:16:55,434
will you do something for me?

815
01:16:59,212 --> 01:17:00,839
Whatever you want.

816
01:17:34,047 --> 01:17:36,515
I ain't played for nobody in years.

817
01:17:44,825 --> 01:17:48,192
I wanted me some kids,
a whole mess of them.

818
01:17:49,262 --> 01:17:53,631
But for Rose, my wife,
kids is for another time.

819
01:17:58,939 --> 01:18:00,497
Then one spring,

820
01:18:03,310 --> 01:18:05,335
I seened a change in her.

821
01:18:06,580 --> 01:18:08,707
Her breasts started swelling up.

822
01:18:09,649 --> 01:18:13,449
Couple of mornings,
I hear her in the bathroom throwing up.

823
01:18:13,553 --> 01:18:18,388
I done seen it in other women before,
so I knew.

824
01:18:22,629 --> 01:18:23,926
Then one day,

825
01:18:24,965 --> 01:18:28,401
Rose said she had to go to Jackson,
visit her folks,

826
01:18:28,502 --> 01:18:32,199
and she ain't wanted me to go,
so I stayed here.

827
01:18:35,642 --> 01:18:39,442
You know how they talk about a woman
having that glow?

828
01:18:42,282 --> 01:18:44,375
She didn't have it no more.

829
01:18:46,853 --> 01:18:48,582
She done cut it out.

830
01:18:49,823 --> 01:18:51,313
Got rid of it.

831
01:18:57,330 --> 01:18:59,230
That voice in my head,

832
01:19:00,634 --> 01:19:04,400
every time I think it's gone,
it comes howling back.

833
01:19:07,340 --> 01:19:09,171
Calls me when I'm ailing,

834
01:19:09,943 --> 01:19:12,673
when I can't find my way home.

835
01:19:13,146 --> 01:19:15,011
Lost in the pines.

836
01:19:16,750 --> 01:19:19,378
I calls it the Black Snake Moan.

837
01:19:25,959 --> 01:19:29,952
Black snake all in my room

838
01:19:42,075 --> 01:19:45,704
Black snake all in my room

839
01:19:54,054 --> 01:19:56,921
Some pretty mamma

840
01:19:57,290 --> 01:20:01,454
Better get this black snake soon

841
01:20:09,769 --> 01:20:12,533
Sing, Laz. Please keep singing.

842
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:22,948
Black snake is evil

843
01:20:24,284 --> 01:20:28,015
Black snake is all I see

844
01:20:35,695 --> 01:20:37,959
Black snake is evil

845
01:20:39,499 --> 01:20:42,991
Black snake is all I see

846
01:20:50,777 --> 01:20:52,768
Woke up this morning

847
01:20:55,115 --> 01:20:58,676
Black snake moved in on me

848
01:21:43,196 --> 01:21:46,029
- Where you gonna be?
- I'm gonna be right here.

849
01:21:46,132 --> 01:21:47,929
- Be here all afternoon.
- Okay.

850
01:21:52,672 --> 01:21:53,730
Hey.

851
01:21:55,308 --> 01:21:57,435
You sure you ready for this?

852
01:21:59,279 --> 01:22:02,510
Yeah. Yeah, no big deal.
I'm just gonna get some girlie stuff.

853
01:22:02,615 --> 01:22:04,879
You know, like some makeup and stuff.

854
01:22:06,453 --> 01:22:07,750
All right.

855
01:22:21,901 --> 01:22:22,959
Hey.

856
01:22:23,703 --> 01:22:26,171
You know,
this town ain't going nowhere.

857
01:22:26,272 --> 01:22:28,365
Take all the time you need.

858
01:22:28,908 --> 01:22:30,239
All right.

859
01:22:51,865 --> 01:22:53,628
She a friend of mine.

860
01:23:11,584 --> 01:23:14,610
I bet you got a lot of loyal customers.

861
01:23:14,721 --> 01:23:16,655
- Hey, Miss Angie.
- Hey.

862
01:23:17,690 --> 01:23:19,351
Like what I brung you, huh?

863
01:23:19,459 --> 01:23:22,292
I've been eating like a princess all week.

864
01:23:23,229 --> 01:23:25,697
I even got enough for us to take lunch.

865
01:23:25,799 --> 01:23:27,130
That'd be nice.

866
01:23:27,233 --> 01:23:30,225
And I got that lotion on you gave me.

867
01:23:31,971 --> 01:23:33,632
Can you smell it?

868
01:23:37,811 --> 01:23:39,472
Now that's nice, too.

869
01:23:59,632 --> 01:24:00,690
Hey.

870
01:24:02,669 --> 01:24:04,603
What happened to your face?

871
01:24:05,305 --> 01:24:07,364
I got in a little accident.

872
01:24:10,443 --> 01:24:13,071
I was thinking,
since you're working on the square now,

873
01:24:13,179 --> 01:24:17,138
if you wanted to, we could get coffee
or something some morning.

874
01:24:17,250 --> 01:24:20,048
- You need money again?
- No.

875
01:24:20,153 --> 01:24:21,381
No, I...

876
01:24:22,822 --> 01:24:24,619
Why we always gotta do this?

877
01:24:24,724 --> 01:24:27,488
You and me been at each other
as far back as I can remember.

878
01:24:27,594 --> 01:24:29,027
I'm your daughter.

879
01:24:30,130 --> 01:24:34,260
- I'm the only family you got.
- You never needed nobody, Rae.

880
01:24:34,367 --> 01:24:36,426
You always made that
perfectly clear to me.

881
01:24:36,536 --> 01:24:37,969
I know I did.

882
01:24:39,405 --> 01:24:43,535
But I'm trying to be different, you know.
I'm trying to get some peace.

883
01:24:45,078 --> 01:24:48,411
Yeah, well, I'm working here now.
Can't you see that?

884
01:24:52,385 --> 01:24:54,410
I just wanted some makeup.

885
01:24:54,521 --> 01:24:56,512
All that shit's on aisle five.

886
01:25:04,497 --> 01:25:07,523
I just think you should've
kept him off me, that's all.

887
01:25:14,741 --> 01:25:18,438
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Now don't do that, Mamma.

888
01:25:18,545 --> 01:25:21,139
I will go along
with all the crap you talk about me,

889
01:25:21,247 --> 01:25:23,442
but you can't pretend no more on that.

890
01:25:23,550 --> 01:25:25,040
'Cause I was just a kid.

891
01:25:25,151 --> 01:25:27,517
I didn't know
about all that shit he was doing to me.

892
01:25:27,620 --> 01:25:29,554
And you let him do it.

893
01:25:29,656 --> 01:25:32,887
Some big nobody in your life and you
let him do whatever the fuck he wanted!

894
01:25:32,992 --> 01:25:36,223
No. Okay. All right. I'm sorry, Mamma.
I didn't mean to shout.

895
01:25:36,329 --> 01:25:37,819
Sorry, I didn't mean to get upset.
I just...

896
01:25:37,931 --> 01:25:39,728
All my life I've been
putting out your fires

897
01:25:39,832 --> 01:25:42,665
while you been giving out your snatch
to every wagging dick in this town!

898
01:25:42,769 --> 01:25:43,929
And now you're gonna
put the blame at my feet?

899
01:25:44,037 --> 01:25:45,163
Mamma, if we can just talk about it.

900
01:25:45,271 --> 01:25:46,898
If you could just tell me,
we could be eye to eye on this.

901
01:25:47,006 --> 01:25:48,166
I'm just not gonna take your shit.
No, I'm not.

902
01:25:48,274 --> 01:25:51,471
You don't have to say you're sorry!
Just tell me how you knew!

903
01:25:51,578 --> 01:25:53,671
The only thing I'm sorry for

904
01:25:53,780 --> 01:25:56,180
is for ever listening to my parents
and having you

905
01:25:56,282 --> 01:25:58,409
and not doing what I should've done.

906
01:26:08,828 --> 01:26:12,628
Tell me you didn't know,
you goddamn liar! Tell me!

907
01:26:13,399 --> 01:26:16,061
You fucking liar!

908
01:26:16,169 --> 01:26:17,659
Fuck you!

909
01:26:17,770 --> 01:26:21,399
You were in the next goddamn room,
you bitch!

910
01:26:23,142 --> 01:26:26,168
What you be doing with yourself
when you ain't working?

911
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:30,181
I was thinking about singing in the choir.

912
01:26:30,283 --> 01:26:31,716
Up at the church?

913
01:26:31,818 --> 01:26:34,912
- Why don't you sing me something?
- When? Now?

914
01:26:35,021 --> 01:26:36,147
- Yeah.
- Oh, no.

915
01:26:36,256 --> 01:26:40,420
Come on now, don't be shy.
Just go ahead and let it out.

916
01:26:43,963 --> 01:26:45,624
All right. Let's see.

917
01:26:48,101 --> 01:26:54,336
There is a balm in Gilead

918
01:26:56,009 --> 01:27:01,276
To make the wounded whole

919
01:27:02,482 --> 01:27:08,944
There is a balm in Gilead

920
01:27:09,922 --> 01:27:15,053
To heal the sin sick soul

921
01:27:15,995 --> 01:27:18,225
What? What is it?

922
01:27:20,266 --> 01:27:21,597
Get off!

923
01:27:23,069 --> 01:27:24,468
My God!

924
01:27:26,739 --> 01:27:29,537
Turn her loose!
Turn her loose, God damn it!

925
01:27:35,248 --> 01:27:37,341
Do you hear the sound of my voice?

926
01:27:42,221 --> 01:27:44,689
Y'all get on out the way now.
Move, man!

927
01:27:49,495 --> 01:27:50,860
This your niece?

928
01:28:22,628 --> 01:28:25,426
You took care of your wife
like you do me?

929
01:28:28,101 --> 01:28:29,295
I tried.

930
01:29:26,359 --> 01:29:28,725
Ain't no use in us fighting this shit.

931
01:29:28,828 --> 01:29:31,023
You and me, we night owls.

932
01:29:32,165 --> 01:29:33,427
Get dressed.

933
01:29:50,883 --> 01:29:53,545
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

934
01:30:01,461 --> 01:30:03,588
All right, see if you can find yourself
a seat over there

935
01:30:03,696 --> 01:30:05,664
in the corner on that bench.

936
01:30:05,765 --> 01:30:08,233
Go on.
Ain't nobody gonna fuck with you.

937
01:30:09,135 --> 01:30:10,534
Who the hell's all this?

938
01:30:10,636 --> 01:30:13,901
What? I called Bojo, like you said.
Called the fellas in the band.

939
01:30:14,006 --> 01:30:15,667
Where the fuck
all these people come from?

940
01:30:15,775 --> 01:30:17,470
I been drinking
in this shithole all my life,

941
01:30:17,577 --> 01:30:19,636
I ain't never seen
this many people in here at once.

942
01:30:19,745 --> 01:30:21,610
Shithole? Kiss my ass, Laz.

943
01:30:21,714 --> 01:30:23,113
Back at you, motherfucker.

944
01:30:23,216 --> 01:30:26,481
I bet both of y'all called all these people,
didn't you?

945
01:30:26,586 --> 01:30:29,987
That's right, preacher, get me drunk
so I don't stick my foot up your ass.

946
01:30:30,089 --> 01:30:32,023
I just know how you get.

947
01:30:32,124 --> 01:30:35,218
Good to know
you still got some butterflies in your gut.

948
01:30:36,362 --> 01:30:38,159
All right, here we go.

949
01:30:39,031 --> 01:30:40,396
Hey, y'all.

950
01:30:41,234 --> 01:30:42,292
All right.

951
01:30:50,877 --> 01:30:54,369
Ced. Ken. Thank y'all for coming.

952
01:30:56,115 --> 01:30:58,640
All y'all, hush up. Shut up.

953
01:30:59,852 --> 01:31:03,049
All right now.
Y'all ready for some shit?

954
01:31:04,323 --> 01:31:06,348
Is you ready for some shit?

955
01:31:08,327 --> 01:31:09,692
Alice Mae.

956
01:31:19,205 --> 01:31:22,038
If you see my baby

957
01:31:22,141 --> 01:31:25,338
They call her Alice Mae

958
01:31:25,444 --> 01:31:27,571
Yeah! You home now, old man!

959
01:31:27,680 --> 01:31:29,978
You just walked through the door!
Yeah!

960
01:31:30,082 --> 01:31:32,642
If you see my baby

961
01:31:32,752 --> 01:31:36,313
They call her Alice Mae

962
01:31:36,422 --> 01:31:38,287
You wanna cut it up, baby?

963
01:31:41,160 --> 01:31:43,788
Tell all them fellas

964
01:31:43,896 --> 01:31:46,831
They'd better stay away

965
01:31:51,237 --> 01:31:53,865
Tell all them fellas

966
01:31:53,973 --> 01:31:57,136
In this here neighborhood

967
01:32:01,814 --> 01:32:04,305
Tell all them fellas

968
01:32:04,417 --> 01:32:07,648
In this here neighborhood

969
01:32:12,858 --> 01:32:14,951
This here's my woman

970
01:32:15,061 --> 01:32:20,192
That chacha will do you no good

971
01:32:29,141 --> 01:32:31,507
Whoa! Yeah!

972
01:32:43,723 --> 01:32:47,386
This here a song from back in the day

973
01:32:47,493 --> 01:32:50,462
Nineteen hundred and sixty-two

974
01:32:52,131 --> 01:32:55,623
My woman put my black ass
out in the cold

975
01:32:55,735 --> 01:32:57,760
I said, "Baby, why you leaving?"

976
01:32:57,870 --> 01:33:00,202
She said, "Our love done gone cold"

977
01:33:00,306 --> 01:33:04,470
Well, I waded through water
and I waded through mud

978
01:33:04,577 --> 01:33:08,980
Till I come to this place
they call the Bucket of Blood

979
01:33:18,758 --> 01:33:21,886
You know, that bartender
give me a dirty look and a dirty glass

980
01:33:21,994 --> 01:33:26,260
I said, "Say, motherfucker!
Do you know who I am?"

981
01:33:26,365 --> 01:33:30,734
He said, "Hell no, nigger!
I don't give a goddamn!"

982
01:33:40,479 --> 01:33:44,279
I reached down in my pocket
and pulled out my shiny .44

983
01:33:44,383 --> 01:33:46,442
Shot that motherfucker twice!

984
01:33:46,552 --> 01:33:48,179
He hit the goddamn floor

985
01:33:53,292 --> 01:33:56,955
'Bout that time
you could've heard the drop of a pin

986
01:33:57,063 --> 01:34:01,432
That's when that bad motherfucker
Billy Lyons walked in

987
01:34:10,609 --> 01:34:14,807
'Bout that time a pimp eased up
and turned out the lights

988
01:34:14,914 --> 01:34:18,645
That's when I had old Billy Lyons
dead in my sights

989
01:34:18,751 --> 01:34:22,380
When the lights come back on
old Billy gone to rest

990
01:34:22,488 --> 01:34:26,720
I pumped nine of my bullets
in his motherfucking chest!

991
01:35:05,364 --> 01:35:08,026
Sometime, that kind of blues

992
01:35:08,768 --> 01:35:12,602
will make you even kill one another

993
01:35:12,705 --> 01:35:16,232
or do anything that kind of low.

994
01:35:16,909 --> 01:35:20,140
It goes here, on this side.

995
01:35:21,781 --> 01:35:23,544
That's where the blues started.

996
01:35:23,649 --> 01:35:25,913
It ain't on this side. It's over here.

997
01:35:31,190 --> 01:35:33,852
This little light of mine

998
01:35:33,959 --> 01:35:37,224
I'm gonna let it shine

999
01:35:37,329 --> 01:35:40,230
This little light of mine

1000
01:35:43,135 --> 01:35:45,626
This little light of mine

1001
01:35:49,575 --> 01:35:52,635
This little light of mine

1002
01:35:52,745 --> 01:35:55,771
I'm gonna let it shine

1003
01:35:55,881 --> 01:35:58,247
This little light of...

1004
01:35:59,518 --> 01:36:00,985
This little light of mine

1005
01:36:01,086 --> 01:36:03,145
Look like somebody know a song.

1006
01:36:04,690 --> 01:36:08,182
No. I got the words in my head
but, you know...

1007
01:36:08,294 --> 01:36:11,163
I don't know where I learned it.
But I can't play.

1008
01:36:12,198 --> 01:36:13,756
How you feeling?

1009
01:36:15,267 --> 01:36:18,202
You know how you feel
when you come out of a bad hangover?

1010
01:36:18,304 --> 01:36:21,034
You know, like you could
open your eyes a little more?

1011
01:36:21,140 --> 01:36:23,267
Yeah. Yeah, I'm there.

1012
01:36:24,476 --> 01:36:27,775
I got up real early this morning.
You know, the sun was shining.

1013
01:36:27,880 --> 01:36:30,678
And I thought
maybe I'd see if I could play this, but...

1014
01:36:30,783 --> 01:36:32,751
- You can.
- No, I can't.

1015
01:36:32,852 --> 01:36:35,320
Yeah, you can.
Right here. Right here, see?

1016
01:36:37,957 --> 01:36:41,256
- I tell you what. You sing.
- All right.

1017
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:44,227
- I'll see if I can pick it out for you.
- Okay.

1018
01:36:46,265 --> 01:36:47,732
All right, now.

1019
01:36:48,367 --> 01:36:53,828
Just close your eyes
and think on what you love.

1020
01:36:55,641 --> 01:36:58,439
- Get a real good picture of it.
- What I love.

1021
01:37:03,048 --> 01:37:06,245
This little light of mine

1022
01:37:06,352 --> 01:37:09,515
I'm gonna let it shine

1023
01:37:09,622 --> 01:37:12,614
This little light of mine

1024
01:37:12,725 --> 01:37:15,819
I'm gonna let it shine

1025
01:37:15,928 --> 01:37:18,920
This little light of mine

1026
01:37:19,031 --> 01:37:21,226
I'm gonna let it shine

1027
01:37:21,333 --> 01:37:27,033
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine

1028
01:37:28,307 --> 01:37:30,434
Hide it under a bushel

1029
01:37:30,542 --> 01:37:34,273
No, I'm gonna let it shine

1030
01:37:34,380 --> 01:37:36,473
Hide it under a bushel

1031
01:37:36,582 --> 01:37:40,575
No, I'm gonna let it shine

1032
01:37:40,686 --> 01:37:42,779
Hide it under a bushel

1033
01:37:42,888 --> 01:37:45,686
No, I'm gonna let it shine

1034
01:37:45,791 --> 01:37:51,661
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine

1035
01:37:52,998 --> 01:37:55,592
This little light of mine

1036
01:37:55,701 --> 01:37:58,670
I'm gonna let it shine

1037
01:37:58,771 --> 01:38:01,672
This little light of mine

1038
01:38:01,774 --> 01:38:04,766
I'm gonna let it shine

1039
01:38:04,877 --> 01:38:07,937
This little light of mine

1040
01:38:08,047 --> 01:38:10,481
I'm gonna let it shine

1041
01:38:10,582 --> 01:38:15,542
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine

1042
01:38:17,323 --> 01:38:18,517
Ronnie!

1043
01:38:19,158 --> 01:38:20,216
No!

1044
01:38:22,728 --> 01:38:26,664
It ain't been but a week
and you already some nigger's whore.

1045
01:38:28,300 --> 01:38:30,734
Oh, did you think I wouldn't find out?

1046
01:38:32,071 --> 01:38:34,403
Did you think I wouldn't find out?

1047
01:38:34,506 --> 01:38:38,943
Gill told me how you and him...
How you and everybody...

1048
01:38:39,044 --> 01:38:41,171
Did you have fun with her, huh?

1049
01:38:41,947 --> 01:38:44,677
Sweet as a peach, I bet! Huh?

1050
01:38:44,783 --> 01:38:47,047
- No!
- Shut up, bitch! Shut the fuck up!

1051
01:38:47,152 --> 01:38:49,814
Be careful where you aim that gun, boy.

1052
01:38:51,190 --> 01:38:53,624
Or what? Huh?

1053
01:38:54,493 --> 01:38:55,892
Or what?

1054
01:38:55,995 --> 01:38:58,259
You come to talk, boy,
or you come to kill somebody?

1055
01:38:58,364 --> 01:39:01,128
You ain't gonna be calling me boy
when I blow your fucking face off!

1056
01:39:01,233 --> 01:39:05,636
Boy, you so green
you couldn't stomp a baby duck.

1057
01:39:06,505 --> 01:39:08,564
Are you testing me? Huh?

1058
01:39:08,674 --> 01:39:11,108
Just what kind of test
would that be, huh?

1059
01:39:12,111 --> 01:39:13,738
Test if you're a man?

1060
01:39:14,646 --> 01:39:16,341
If you're a killer?

1061
01:39:17,216 --> 01:39:19,707
Hell, that ain't hard to find out, is it?

1062
01:39:19,818 --> 01:39:22,548
All you gotta do is pull that trigger back.

1063
01:39:23,188 --> 01:39:24,314
Go on.

1064
01:39:25,090 --> 01:39:26,352
Go ahead.

1065
01:39:29,661 --> 01:39:31,754
- Okay, Ronnie...
- God damn it, Rae!

1066
01:39:31,864 --> 01:39:34,264
Keep that gun trained on me, boy.

1067
01:39:34,366 --> 01:39:37,699
Now, you wanna kill a man,
and all you need's a reason, right?

1068
01:39:37,803 --> 01:39:40,203
Well, you know
she been out here with me.

1069
01:39:41,640 --> 01:39:45,633
Been all over town giving up that switch
you thought was yours.

1070
01:39:45,744 --> 01:39:48,941
- Shut up!
- Give all your love to one woman

1071
01:39:49,048 --> 01:39:51,414
and she give it to another man.

1072
01:39:51,517 --> 01:39:54,145
Now that's a reason to kill a man there.

1073
01:39:54,253 --> 01:39:57,984
Then won't be no questions.
She'll know you a man!

1074
01:39:58,090 --> 01:40:00,217
- A real killer!
- Don't say that to me!

1075
01:40:00,325 --> 01:40:03,021
I'm too old to play house or cowboys.

1076
01:40:04,696 --> 01:40:07,631
You gonna do it or get out of my face.

1077
01:40:10,135 --> 01:40:11,261
Go on.

1078
01:40:12,137 --> 01:40:13,297
Do it!

1079
01:40:14,473 --> 01:40:16,236
Ronnie. Ronnie.

1080
01:40:17,976 --> 01:40:21,810
Ronnie, baby, look at me.
Ronnie, look at me. Look at me.

1081
01:40:21,914 --> 01:40:23,472
Come on, look at me.

1082
01:40:23,582 --> 01:40:27,678
Baby, it's all right. I got you. I got you.

1083
01:40:27,786 --> 01:40:30,721
Come on. Come on.

1084
01:40:35,060 --> 01:40:37,654
Hold on. Hold on, baby.

1085
01:40:39,698 --> 01:40:41,393
- Hey, it's me.
- It's okay.

1086
01:40:41,500 --> 01:40:43,627
I need you to get over here.

1087
01:40:44,369 --> 01:40:45,927
Yeah, right now!

1088
01:40:56,582 --> 01:40:59,176
We did a lot of dreaming, me and Rae.

1089
01:41:01,553 --> 01:41:03,544
Made big plans to get out.

1090
01:41:08,794 --> 01:41:12,787
I'd go do my tour and move out of here.

1091
01:41:15,734 --> 01:41:17,565
Maybe go to Knoxville.

1092
01:41:27,112 --> 01:41:28,477
But when Rae

1093
01:41:29,348 --> 01:41:31,441
gets like she does

1094
01:41:34,019 --> 01:41:35,714
and does the things

1095
01:41:37,656 --> 01:41:39,248
that she does...

1096
01:41:44,163 --> 01:41:46,154
Go on, Ronnie. Go on.

1097
01:41:46,265 --> 01:41:50,065
- This is fucking stupid.
- Go on.

1098
01:41:51,803 --> 01:41:54,533
What Rae did for me,

1099
01:41:58,877 --> 01:42:00,344
she fixed me.

1100
01:42:07,152 --> 01:42:08,881
But I can't fix her.

1101
01:42:13,559 --> 01:42:14,583
Rae,

1102
01:42:16,195 --> 01:42:19,289
we don't wanna fix you or judge you.

1103
01:42:20,532 --> 01:42:22,864
Only you and the good Lord can do that.

1104
01:42:23,936 --> 01:42:27,099
But I want you to tell me
about these spells you get.

1105
01:42:31,810 --> 01:42:33,004
Well,

1106
01:42:35,380 --> 01:42:37,974
I get these thoughts in my head,
you know.

1107
01:42:40,018 --> 01:42:44,011
Like shit I done
or shit that's been done to me,

1108
01:42:44,122 --> 01:42:46,750
and I can't get them out.

1109
01:42:47,326 --> 01:42:50,159
And it burns, you know, it hurts.

1110
01:42:50,262 --> 01:42:54,130
It starts in my head
and moves down to my hands,

1111
01:42:54,233 --> 01:42:58,397
and my stomach, and then lower, and...

1112
01:43:00,472 --> 01:43:05,910
You know, sometimes I can stop them
but mostly I can't.

1113
01:43:06,912 --> 01:43:09,142
The only thing that ever
made that feel better was Ronnie

1114
01:43:09,248 --> 01:43:10,909
'cause I love him so much.

1115
01:43:12,751 --> 01:43:16,847
Why don't you look at Ronnie
and tell him how you feel?

1116
01:43:32,604 --> 01:43:35,266
I think... I think we're fucked up.

1117
01:43:36,575 --> 01:43:39,100
Both of us. I mean, I know I am.

1118
01:43:41,546 --> 01:43:45,346
But that don't mean
that what I feel isn't real,

1119
01:43:45,851 --> 01:43:47,910
that I can't love somebody.

1120
01:43:50,222 --> 01:43:55,956
And I know how I've been
and what I've done is real, real bad.

1121
01:43:57,062 --> 01:43:58,222
But...

1122
01:44:07,539 --> 01:44:10,235
So if you wanna quit on me,
I understand.

1123
01:44:11,877 --> 01:44:13,401
But please don't.

1124
01:44:17,749 --> 01:44:18,841
So,

1125
01:44:20,819 --> 01:44:23,219
what you two gonna do about this?

1126
01:44:39,237 --> 01:44:40,829
Hi, Miss Angie.

1127
01:44:40,939 --> 01:44:45,433
You wasn't at your work
so I just figured I'd drop by.

1128
01:44:45,544 --> 01:44:47,011
What you need?

1129
01:44:48,313 --> 01:44:50,178
I need your help again.

1130
01:44:51,016 --> 01:44:52,574
More cough syrup?

1131
01:44:54,686 --> 01:44:55,914
Come on.

1132
01:45:00,959 --> 01:45:02,119
Shit.

1133
01:45:04,363 --> 01:45:05,728
You Ronnie?

1134
01:45:07,666 --> 01:45:08,690
Yeah.

1135
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:11,496
I'm Lincoln.
I'm gonna be your best man.

1136
01:45:12,604 --> 01:45:13,696
Okay.

1137
01:45:14,206 --> 01:45:17,642
You having trouble with that tie?
'Cause I'm pretty good at it.

1138
01:45:24,416 --> 01:45:27,613
Gotta do it like this
or I'll get all turned around.

1139
01:45:32,824 --> 01:45:35,622
Laz, she's ready.

1140
01:45:41,466 --> 01:45:43,058
Ain't she pretty?

1141
01:45:43,602 --> 01:45:46,002
I'll give y'all some time together.

1142
01:45:52,677 --> 01:45:54,440
Now that is sharp!

1143
01:45:55,113 --> 01:45:57,604
Girl, you sharp as a tack.

1144
01:45:57,716 --> 01:45:59,775
Old Miss Ella Mae done you right,
didn't she?

1145
01:45:59,885 --> 01:46:01,546
- Yeah.
- You like it?

1146
01:46:01,653 --> 01:46:03,120
I've had nice things before

1147
01:46:03,221 --> 01:46:05,451
but, you know,
I always seem to ruin them somehow.

1148
01:46:05,557 --> 01:46:09,084
This here one yours.
I know you gonna take care of it.

1149
01:46:09,194 --> 01:46:12,652
- I'm gonna try. But, Laz...
- Hey, hey.

1150
01:46:12,764 --> 01:46:16,359
We ain't gonna have
no talk like that today, all right?

1151
01:46:16,468 --> 01:46:20,336
You and me, we gonna get through this.
We gonna be just fine.

1152
01:46:21,673 --> 01:46:24,164
You go on and live your life.

1153
01:46:24,276 --> 01:46:27,939
Get your shit together and live your life.

1154
01:46:29,014 --> 01:46:30,072
Okay.

1155
01:46:36,054 --> 01:46:38,454
I don't want you to let go of me.

1156
01:46:39,658 --> 01:46:40,989
You and me,

1157
01:46:42,494 --> 01:46:44,894
we always gonna have hope
to each other.

1158
01:46:52,137 --> 01:46:56,597
When I was a child, I talked like a child,

1159
01:46:56,708 --> 01:47:01,338
I thought like a child,
I reasoned like a child.

1160
01:47:02,414 --> 01:47:07,215
When I became a man,
I put aside my childish ways.

1161
01:47:08,353 --> 01:47:11,049
All right. You got her now.

1162
01:47:12,858 --> 01:47:14,985
And now these three remain,

1163
01:47:16,428 --> 01:47:21,422
faith, hope and love.

1164
01:47:21,967 --> 01:47:24,993
But the greatest of these is love.

1165
01:48:48,954 --> 01:48:50,148
Ronnie?

1166
01:48:51,823 --> 01:48:53,154
I gotta pull over.

1167
01:49:34,099 --> 01:49:35,157
Okay.

1168
01:49:36,635 --> 01:49:37,693
Okay.

1169
01:49:38,937 --> 01:49:39,995
Okay.

1170
01:49:41,873 --> 01:49:44,273
This little light of mine

1171
01:49:44,376 --> 01:49:47,277
I'm gonna let it shine

1172
01:49:47,379 --> 01:49:49,870
This little light of mine

1173
01:49:49,981 --> 01:49:52,211
I'm gonna let it shine

1174
01:49:52,317 --> 01:49:55,115
This little light of mine

1175
01:49:55,220 --> 01:49:58,280
I'm gonna let it shine

1176
01:49:58,390 --> 01:50:02,759
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine

1177
01:50:07,232 --> 01:50:08,529
Baby.

1178
01:50:10,602 --> 01:50:11,660
See?

1179
01:50:12,404 --> 01:50:13,996
See? We're okay.

1180
01:50:14,673 --> 01:50:16,004
We're okay.
