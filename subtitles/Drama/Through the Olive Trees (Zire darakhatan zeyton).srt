1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:06,480
I'm Mohamed Ali Keshavarz,
the actor who plays the director.

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,360
The other actors
were hired on location.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,000
We're in Koker,
about 400 kilometers

4
00:00:12,701 --> 00:00:14,951
no, 350 kilometers
north of Teheran,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,280
where an earthquake
destroyed everything last year.

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,000
The girls are hungry,
they've still got a long way to go.

7
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:23,000
Can we speed it up a bit?

8
00:00:24,701 --> 00:00:27,500
We have come to this rebuilt school

9
00:00:27,501 --> 00:00:29,001
to choose a young actress.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry, I'm late.

11
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,920
What's your name?

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,920
Mehri Ziai

13
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,080
- What's your name?

14
00:00:55,081 --> 00:00:57,000

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,280
- And you?

16
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,000
- You, what's your name?
- Tahereh Ladanian.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,720
Mrs. Shiva,
note down this girl's address.

18
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,480
- Your address?
- Near the Lakeh bazaar.

19
00:01:11,481 --> 00:01:12,480
- Your name?
- Tahereh Ladanian

20
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,840
- Your address
Near the Lakeh bazaar.

21
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,560
- You, what's your name?
- Fariba Jafari

22
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,000
- What class?
3rd Year literature.

23
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,280
- Mrs. Shiva, note down her name too.

24
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,920
- And you?
- Nazila Khadem

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,920
Mrs. Shiva, note her name.

26
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,760
- Your address?
- I haven't got a real address

27
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,520
But where do you live?

28
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,520
Rostam-Abbad, in Jalalye.

29
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,000
It's cold.

30
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,120
What's your name?

31
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,080
Zinat Hassanpour

32
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,600
You're all out of line!

33
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,000
Where will you show it?

34
00:01:53,001 --> 00:01:55,000
You're filming us...
Oh, what does it matter?

35
00:01:55,001 --> 00:01:57,001
You won't show it.

36
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,320
- You mean, on TV?
- Yes

37
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:02,320
You're right.

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,120
But is that any reason
not to film?

39
00:02:05,121 --> 00:02:07,080
Aren't you going to show it to us?

40
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,680
Your last film went out on Channel 2,
which we can't get here. Why bother?

41
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,640
What do you say?
Do we film or not?

42
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,400
We film!

43
00:02:16,401 --> 00:02:17,401
We film!
But you'll have to show it!

44
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,320
Yes, you'll have to show it!

45
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,120
- What's your name again?
- Tahereh.

46
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,600
Tahereh what?

47
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,680
Poursadeghi

48
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,320
Mrs. Shiva, note her name too.

49
00:02:28,321 --> 00:02:30,000
Say your name again.

50
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,600
Your address?

51
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,960
You, what's your name?

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,040
Zahra Djenab.

53
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,200
- From where?
- Rostam-Abbad.

54
00:02:41,201 --> 00:02:42,040
- How old are you?
- 15.

55
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,440
15?

56
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,800
Mrs. Shiva, note down her name.

57
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:48,920
- Your name?
- Zahra Dejnab.

58
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,600
- Your address?
- Rostam-Abbad, in Koker.

59
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:07,360

Today is Sunday

70
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,200
9th day in the month of Khord,

71
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,200
or the 8th in the month of Zihadjeh,

or also May 30, 1993.

73
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,000
1353 years ago,
on a day like this,

74
00:04:32,001 --> 00:04:35,001
8th of the month of Zihadjeh
in year 60...

75
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,400
- Hello
- Hello

76
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,920
- Are you well?
- Yes, thank you.

77
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,080
Were you going on foot?

78
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,400
I'd given up waiting for you,

79
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,520
so I started walking
to catch up with the minibus.

80
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,360
We worked late last night
and it was hard getting up.

81
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,400
This is what you asked for.

82
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,200
Chalk?

83
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,000
Yes, but not the chalk you wanted.

84
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,000
This was made by the students.

85
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:07,120
They didn't sift it very well.
There may be small stones in it.

86
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,000
If it doesn't write well,

87
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,800
break it in two
and you will find it will work better.

88
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:21,000
You will find some at the school,
perhaps better quality too.

89
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,280
We're not going to school.

90
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,000
Why do you need chalk then?

91
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,640
For the clapboard.

92
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,400
What's that?

93
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,400
It's used to identify shots.

94
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,520
We write on it
like on a blackboard.

95
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,000
I see,
a board for the shooting.

96
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,800
I remember I saw one on the set
of "Where is My Friend's House?"

97
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,200
I remember,
you were very good in that film.

98
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,000
That's kind of you!
I played the part of the teacher.

99
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,200
You were perfect in the part.

100
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,600
Oh, it's a part I play every day,
I am a teacher!

101
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,600
I have a favour to ask of you...

102
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,720
Excuse me, ma'am,
could you catch up with the minibus?

103
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,320
The school system
provides you with a minibus?

104
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,000
No, it belongs
to the Gandjeh shoe factory.

105
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,600
It drops us at the factory
and we cover the last kilometer

106
00:06:15,601 --> 00:06:19,000
on foot to get to Saramarz.

107
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,520
As I was saying...
I don't really like

108
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,720
films, cinema
and art in general.

109
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,720
But...
with this earthquake...

110
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,200
and all our problems...

111
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,000
Well, if you could possibly

112
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,200
find me a small part

113
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:43,701
in your film...

114
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,720
- Of course.
- Thank you very much.

115
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,320
Take the short-cut.

116
00:06:48,321 --> 00:06:50,600
- This way?
- Yes yes, that way.

117
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,600
- You won't forget...
- Don't worry.

118
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,760
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

119
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,000
Tahereh...

120
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,520
Tahereh...

121
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,800
Miss Tahereh...

122
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,720
- Grandmother...
- Yes?

123
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,480
Hello, grandmother.

124
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,200
- Are you well?
- Yes, thank God.

125
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,320
- Where has Tahereh gone?
- I don't know.

126
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,960
We were meeting at 7:30.

127
00:08:06,961 --> 00:08:12,320
She left at dawn,
to borrow a dress from a friend.

128
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:17,000
I don't know where she is now.

129
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,000
- So what do I do?
- Make yourself comfortable.

130
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,880
-  How are you grandmother?
- Come up here.

131
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,200
Come and sit down.

132
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,120
Come up here and sit down near me.

133
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,080
- I'll wait for her here.
- She's gone to school.

134
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,200
She told me
she was going to borrow a dress.

135
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:41,080
I'm not quite sure,
I don't know everything she does.

136
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,400
It's hard to understand...

137
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,400
What did she say exactly?
Do I wait for her or not?

138
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,920
- What do I do?
- I don't know ...

139
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,500
At her age, she can't keep still.
She can't keep her word.

140
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,480
You were wrong to arrange
to meet her.

141
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:04,080
This morning
I sent here to the well

142
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,080
but she left the water
down in the yard.

143
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,280
With my bad legs,
I can't go down there.

144
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
The time it takes to get down there,
my food's burned...

145
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,200
Besides, she's forgotten her book.

146
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,320
- Thank you for the water
- That's okay. Do you want some?

147
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,400
Yes, please.

148
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,800
You're back at last, are you?

149
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,080
What time do you call this?

150
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,200
I went to see my friend.

151
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,200
It's  6:30
and you're not ready yet!

152
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,640
I went to borrow a dress.

153
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,280
- Well? Did you find one?
- Yes.

154
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,400
Let me see.

155
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,000
You're supposed to wear
a peasant dress, not one like that.

156
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,200
My friend said it suited me.
It just needs taking in.

157
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,080
I tell her to change the dress,
and she says she'll take it in!

158
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,480
- You will wear a peasant dress!
- Just let me try it on.

159
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,000
You can't just do as you please.

160
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,800
You'll  wear a peasant dress,

161
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,960
I won't say it again.

162
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,520
- She said it just needs taking in.
- I said no!

163
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,000
I'll try it on and you'll see.

164
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,720
It's hopeless,
she's so stubborn!

165
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,800
You have to wear a peasant dress.
Understand? A peasant dress!

166
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,200
No one wears them nowadays.

167
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,200
- Pour, please.
- Is that enough?

168
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,320
Yes, thank you very much.

169
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,000
What did you say?

170
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,400
No one
wears dresses like that anymore.

171
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,880
What about your grandmother?
She wears one, a very pretty one.

172
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,080
They're for old people, not me.

173
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,200
I've seen young people wear them.
They suited them too.

174
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,880
But they wear peasants,
illiterate peasants!

175
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,080
Students don't wear them.
You saw that.

176
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,600
At school, of course not,
since those are the rules.

177
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,280
But you have to wear one for us.

178
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,400
How on earth did you bring her up?

179
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,080
She won't stop arguing!

180
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,080
I didn't bring her up, ma'am.

181
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,000
Her mother did, God bless her.

182
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,600
Is something wrong?

183
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,880
Tahereh, that's a pretty dress,
it suits you perfectly...

184
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,880
but it's not right for us.

185
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,800
It's the only one I've got.

186
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,200
It's all right, I'll sort it out.

187
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,800
- It's the only one I'll wear.
- She's looking for an excuse!

188
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,280
She can have her mother's dress,
from the chest.

189
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,400
Can I borrow a flower-pot?

190
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,400
- I will bring it back.
- Take that one.

191
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,720
No, I prefer this one.
The stem's too long on that one.

192
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,800
- Thank you. Good-bye.
- God go with you!

193
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,800
I'll fetch you at one o'clock.

194
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,600
All right, one o'clock.

195
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,680
Mrs. Shiva!

196
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,080
Hello, how are you?
You've only got one pot?

197
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,520
Yes. But Babak is bringing
two others.

198
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,800
- What's your name?
- Ahmad.

199
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,040
Ahmad what?
- Ahmadpour

200
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,680
Ahmand Ahmadpour.
Put it in the back.

201
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,880
Careful you don't break the stem.

202
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,800
- Mind the stem!
- All right.

203
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,840
And the flower too.

204
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,520
Hello

205
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,920
- They're all dry!
- This is all they had.

206
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,160
Put them in the back
with the others.

207
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,080
Thanks, boys.
Where are you going?

208
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,200
We're going to school.
We've got exams.

209
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,200
-  I'll give you a lift.
- Thanks but it's just over there.

210
00:13:40,201 --> 00:13:41,701
In the tents.

211
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,400
Oh , okay. Good-bye then.

212
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,320
Do you want to come to the set,
after your exams?

213
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,400
Yes...

214
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,400
- Do you know where?
- Koker.

215
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,480
- That's right. Come when you want...
- Okay. Good-bye.

216
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,000
Scene 4, shot 1, take 1.

217
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,280
Action!

218
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,680
Very good... Stay where you are.

219
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,120
- Hello
- Hello

220
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,320
- Hello
- God be with you

221
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,280
Cut!

222
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,680
Why don't you reply?

223
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,400
She says: "God be with you,"
and then you say:"Take care. "

224
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,880
Then you ask her for water
and that's all.

225
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,360
Take the sack of plaster
and go down.

226
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,720
Do you understand?

227
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,400
Let's go.

228
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,120
Ready?

229
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,120
Shot 1, take 2.

230
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,280
Very good... Stay where you are.

231
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,560
- Hello
- Hello

232
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,000
God be with you...

233
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,480
Cut!

234
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,600
Speak! Answer her!

235
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,800
When she greets you,
you say your lines!

236
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,680
Take the sack and go down.

237
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,400
Fardhad...

238
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,520
When he greets you,
look at him for a second.

239
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,280
And then answer him.

240
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:54,800
Let's go.

241
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,880
- Sound?
- Ready.

242
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,400
Camera?

243
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,160
Shot 1, take 3.

244
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,200
Very good, stay where you are!

245
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,920
- Hello
- Hello

246
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,800
- Hello
- Hello

247
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,400
God be with you...

248
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,200
Why don't you say anything?
Don't you want to say it?

249
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,480
Have you forgotten?

250
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Come down.

251
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,000
Take down the sack.

252
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,800
Take it and go down!

253
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,000
No sir, I can't do it.

254
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,120
- What?
- I can't do it.

255
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,120
What's that supposed to mean?

256
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,600
Can you come here a minute?

257
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,720
- What?
- Will you come here a minute?

258
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,400
What's wrong?

259
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,000
I stammer.

260
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,400
What?

261
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,600
You were speaking fine earlier!

262
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,680
Yes... but...
When I speak to a girl...

263
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,120
I start stammering.

264
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,800
Right.
You can go.

265
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,680
Azim, wait,
we'll give you a lift.

266
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,200
- Mrs. Shiva...
- Yes?

267
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,880
Drive him back
and bring me Hossein.

268
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,480
Hossein? Who's that?

269
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,800
- Our Hossein, at the camp.
- All right.

270
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,880
Get in the car, I'll take you back.

271
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,200
- Mrs. Shiva
- Yes?

272
00:17:52,201 --> 00:17:55,120
Rehearse with Hossein in the car,
and hurry!

273
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,200
- Time's short!
- All right.

274
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,000
Shall we put the camera away?

275
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,080
No, leave it,
they're coming back.

276
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,600
Children, you can't come over
to this side of the rope,

277
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,680
but can I cross it?

278
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,680
Yes!... No!... Yes!... No!...

279
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,680
- Well, can I or can't I?
-  Come on!

280
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:05,520
- Haven't you got exams?
- No... Yes, we have!

281
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,680
What are you doing here then?

282
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,800
We came to see the shoot.

283
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,320
- You came all this way?
- Yes!

284
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,200
- How many kilometers is that?
- 9 kilometers!

285
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,080
I'd like to ask you a question.

286
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,120
Ask me!

287
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,480
Wait...

288
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,480
Children, can you tell me
what co-operation is?

289
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,000
I know! Can I answer?

290
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,440
- Calm down! You, answer me.
- Working with one another.

291
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,760
Working with one another.

292
00:19:35,761 --> 00:19:36,800
Can I answer?

293
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,400
Helping one another.

294
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,680
It's my turn.
Yes, you now.

295
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Now let's see if you can tell me...

296
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,520
the capital of Guilan.

297
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,800
- I know! I know!
- Rasht! Rasht! Rasht!

298
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:05,000
- Where's Rostam-Abbad?
- At Poshteh, in Guilan.

299
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,240
Near Roudbar

300
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,000
- And what's the speciality of Roudbar?
- Olives! Olives!

301
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,600
- Repeat your lines to me.
- But I know them.

302
00:20:24,601 --> 00:20:28,680
- Don't worry.
- Say them, to put my mind at rest.

303
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,800
I put the sack of plaster there,
and go up the stairs.

304
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,200
Does it have to be plaster?

305
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,680
Remember you have to do
what we tell you!

306
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,800
Okay, fine...

307
00:20:43,801 --> 00:20:46,800
I take the plaster and go upstairs.
Up there, a woman says:

308
00:20:47,801 --> 00:20:49,401
"Good luck."

309
00:20:50,702 --> 00:20:52,921
No, she says
"God be with you."

310
00:20:52,922 --> 00:20:54,400
She says: "God be with you."

311
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,560
And I answer:
"Give me water, I'm thirsty."

312
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,040
Is that right?
Does that suit you?

313
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,680
What's going on?
You're blocking the road!

314
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,000
We'll move.

315
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,360
With that car and your bricks,
how do I get past?

316
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,600
We'll have it moved soon.

317
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,680
I've got to get through!

318
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,800
You'll get through, Inch' Allah,
in half an hour.

319
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,920
You're joking!
I've got tons of things to do!

320
00:21:27,921 --> 00:21:33,520
So have we! We come from the provinces,
we slave here for others,

321
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,480
all that just to feed our families.

322
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,800
That's no answer.
How do I get past?

323
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,920
We'll ask a worker
to clear the road.

324
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,520
But just one!

325
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,800
That's not my problem.
I'm in a hurry!

326
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,680
If you're in a hurry,
your worker can help us.

327
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,080
move the bricks
and clear the road!

328
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,920
- We'll all finish faster.
- It's not his job to do that!

329
00:21:57,921 --> 00:22:01,000
- It's your job.
- It is not our problem!

330
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,320
- You're blocking the road!
You should clear it.

331
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,200
You move them.

332
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,520
Ma'am, I'm really sorry.

333
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,000
I'll gladly do anything you ask,
but not masonry...

334
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,480
I'm not in building anymore.

335
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,480
I came to appear in your film.

336
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,520
I'll work as an actor,
but not as a mason!

337
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,480
- Yes?
- The road to Koker, please?

338
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,920
- Koker? It's behind you.
- The road's blocked.

339
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,600
Carry on a bit,
there's a track after the bridge.

340
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,000
Hey! Hossein!
Don't get too big-headed!

341
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,480
Ma'am...

342
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,360
Why ask someone else
for directions

343
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,680
when I'm from around here?

344
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,600
Since you no longer
touch plaster or masonry,

345
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,920
I thought you didn't
give directions either!

346
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,520
You only want only to be an actor...

347
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,400
so I asked someone else.

348
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,280
- Whose turn?
- Mine, sir!

349
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:47,000
You? No, you're too clever.

350
00:23:47,001 --> 00:23:48,701
Too clever by half.

351
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Right, children,
we'll see about the rest later.

352
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,200
- Mr. Panahi, are you ready?
- Yes.

353
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,480
Hossein, hurry up!

354
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,800
- Mr. Jafarian?
- Yes?

355
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,200
Mrs. Shiva, hurry up.

356
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,800
We're rehearsing.

357
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,880
Mr. Kheradmand, hurry.

358
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,240
Ready when you are.

359
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,480
Shot 1, take 1.

360
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,200
Very good... Stay where you are!

361
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,720
- Hello!
- Hello

362
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Hello...

363
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,800
Cut!

364
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,920
Hossein,
why don't you say anything?

365
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,600
Pick up the sack
and go back down.

366
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,080
Farhad, don't look at him too much
as he goes up!

367
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
- Understand?
- Yes.

368
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,680
Shot 1, take 2

369
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,480
Very good... Stay where you are!

370
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,480
- Hello
- Hello

371
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,840
Hello...

372
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,000
Cut!

373
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,280
Mrs. Shiva,
didn't you rehearse with him?

374
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,520
Of course I did,
he was fine in the car.

375
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,680
Take the sack back down.

376
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,320
When I say hello to her,
she doesn't reply.

377
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,120
She refuses to greet me.
What am I supposed to do?

378
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,480
- She doesn't say hello?
- No.

379
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,400
Right, we've stopped
because of you.

380
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,680
so tell me, what' s going on
between you and that girl.

381
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,800
Tell me.

382
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,600
Well, it was at Eynollah's,
God bless him,

383
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,520
where I used to work.

384
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,400
This young girl used to live
in the house just opposite.

385
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:12,200
She was sitting on the stairs,
studying

386
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
She was there, just opposite me,
and to my eyes,

387
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:22,480
she looked so gentle,
the kind I could see myself marrying.

388
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,400
I conceived the notion
 of marrying her.

389
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,480
Then I went back to work
until the end of the day.

390
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,600
When I went to wash
my hands and feet,

391
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:41,520
I saw her mother
coming over to the spring to fetch water.

392
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I spoke to her about her daughter.
She got annoyed.

393
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,000
Why?

394
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,000
I don't know.
Perhaps she thought

395
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,800
I wasn't serious enough,

396
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,200
that I wanted to spread rumours,

397
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,200
that I didn't want her really,
that I didn't deserve her.

398
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,600
Fine and then?

399
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:09,680
That evening I went to change my clothes
and Eynollah told me not to bother


400
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,680
coming to work the next day.

401
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:16,320
I think she asked Eynollah
to fire me

402
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:22,000
and then offered him a good worker
to replace me.

403
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,800
That was the night
the earthquake struck.

404
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:30,800
Eynollah's family
- God bless them - 

405
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:36,200
and the family of this girl,
Tahereh, were killed

406
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,880
- Tahereh's parents?
- Yes.

407
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,400
- And then?
- They all perished.

408
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:50,000
On the third day of mourning,
I went to the cemetery.

409
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,280
There were so many people there
that I wasn't able to see her.

410
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:02,800
On the 7th day of mourning,

411
00:29:02,801 --> 00:29:07,801
I saw her at her parents' grave.
I wanted to speak to her,

412
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,080
but her grandmother
asked me to pray for the dead.

413
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,400
Before I was able
to finish my prayer.

414
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,480
they had disappeared.

415
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,200
You haven't seen her since?

416
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,400
- Never?
- No.

417
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:27,320
Only once,
on the 40th day of mourning.

418
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,280
And what did you do?

419
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:33,400
On the 40th day, I went back
to the cemetery.

420
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,800
Her grandmother was there.

421
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,600
I said to myself
that these poor people

422
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:43,200
knew now that the world is cruel,

423
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,720
and that life is short,

424
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,800
that they wouldn't disappoint me.

425
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,000
If these people
had treated me better earlier

426
00:29:56,001 --> 00:29:57,920
perhaps all this
wouldn't have happened to them.

427
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,400
The earthquake may not have happened.

428
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:04,200
I thought
that the sighing in my heart

429
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,400
had destroyed all these houses.

430
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:14,480
Could I buy myself a house
just like that?

431
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,320
Besides,
as my heart was heavy.

432
00:30:18,321 --> 00:30:23,400
I wanted to relieve my sorrow

433
00:30:23,401 --> 00:30:25,520
and pour it out on them.

434
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,200
I said to them:
"Now that nobody

435
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:34,520
has a house anymore,
here we are all

436
00:30:34,521 --> 00:30:36,520
on an equal footing.
I haven't got a house,

437
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,120
but neither have you!"

438
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,000
I see.

439
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,800
Since I was 11 years old

440
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,120
I had worked in other people's houses.

441
00:30:53,121 --> 00:30:54,800
It was your trade?

442
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,800
My trade?

443
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,440
I worked with a mason.

444
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,320
What exactly did you do?

445
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:03,520
I laid bricks,
earth bricks or cement bricks.

446
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,400
I did that sort of work.

447
00:31:06,401 --> 00:31:07,920
People have always said to me:

448
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
"No house, no woman."

449
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,800
Since I didn't have a house,

450
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,440
no one would give me a woman
to marry.

451
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,960
It takes time
to build a house.

452
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,840
And you haven't seen her since?

453
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,920
I have.
Not this Thursday,

454
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:28,400
but the one before,

455
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,200
the day I saw you on the set.

456
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,080
And?

457
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,800
I asked
for her hand in marriage again.

458
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:42,480
I didn't want to see them again,
but I decided to go anyway.

459
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,480
Where?

460
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:52,000
To the cemetery.  I saw them there.

461
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,880
Is he here again?
He never leaves us alone!

462
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,520
He won't leave us in peace!

463
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:26,800
- The key?
- Go on, I'm coming.

464
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,880
- Hello

465
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,680
- Are you well?
- Yes, thank God!

466
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,880
- Can I have your answer?
- The answer's no.

467
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:18,120
Apparently your granddaughter
is willing. So why not?

468
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,600
You want my answer?
Well,  it's no!

469
00:34:20,601 --> 00:34:23,600
What does that mean?
Try to think of me too!

470
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,800
Everyone says
she wants to get married

471
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,200
and you stubbornly keep on saying:
"The answer's no."

472
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,600
The answer's no!

473
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,120
Give me at least two reasons.
Explain it to me.

474
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,200
You're illiterate,
you've got no home!

475
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:41,880
The important thing is manners,
intelligence and understanding.

476
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,880
You may be kind and understanding,
but you need a house!

477
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,520
She chose me.

478
00:34:47,521 --> 00:34:49,280
You're stopping us living together.

479
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,400
The answer's no.

480
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:55,200
You've got no house, you're illiterate,
you're empty-headed.

481
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,320
Mind your own business!

482
00:34:56,321 --> 00:35:01,520
You won't have her!
Stop thinking about her!

483
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,800
Otherwise,
I'll make your life hell!

484
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:12,400
If her parents were still alive,
I'd at least have a little hope...

485
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,880
But with you, nothing!

486
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,800
If they were alive,
they wouldn't give her to you.

487
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,000
Even them!

488
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,480
Are you sure that's also the way
your granddaughter feels?

489
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,800
My answer's no!

490
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,600
Cut!

491
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,240
Wait a minute!

492
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,360
What are you doing there?

493
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,520
Run fast, come over here...

494
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,520
A little faster!

495
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,720
Come quickly over here.

496
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,120
Back here...

497
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,600
We're filming

498
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,880
Sound.

499
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,600
Camera.

500
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,880
Scene 7, shot 2, take 2

501
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,480
Action!

502
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,200
After I take Tahereh back,

503
00:36:57,201 --> 00:36:58,480
can I go and fetch the one...

504
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,600
That...

505
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,200
Who?

506
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,240
After I take Tahereh back
can I go and fetch Poursadeghi?

507
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:17,520
- Who's Poursadeghi?
- The girl with green eyes.

508
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,880
Ask Tahereh, not me.

509
00:37:19,881 --> 00:37:21,600
She's better for the part.

510
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,880
But I can't do anything
if she won't talk.

511
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,880
She doesn't listen,
she doesn't act...

512
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,840
It's obvious. He's the problem!

513
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:32,120
With Azim,
there wasn't any problem.

514
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,800
Let's avoid the problems.
- How?

515
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:41,200
- Do what you can.
- I'm not sure I'll be able to.

516
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,400
- Try anyway.
- All right.

517
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,800
Hossein, fetch my cigarettes
from the car.

518
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,120
- What?
- Fetch my cigarettes.

519
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,120
All right.

520
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,320
- Hello Bagheri.
- Hello.

521
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,880
- How are you?
- Very well, thanks.

522
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,320
I'm delighted.

523
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,040
That smells good.
What are you cooking up for us?

524
00:39:20,041 --> 00:39:21,400
Mirza ghassemi.

525
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
The crew asked for it for dinner.

526
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,880
- Bagheri?
- Yes?

527
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,320
What was the dish
with the sharp taste?

528
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,800
That was torshi tareh.

529
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,880
How do you make that?

530
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,280
- Torshi Tareh?
- No. In fact...

531
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,880
- I'd rather you told me...
- What?

532
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,600
Isn't your wife jealous
of your cooking skills?

533
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:51,600
She used to be once, yes.
Now she isn't here anymore.

534
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,600
- Really?
- Yes. She's dead.

535
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,400
She was killed in the earthquake.

536
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,200
God bless her.

537
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,800
- You're alone now?
- Alone, yes.

538
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,480
- Cigarette?
- No, I just had one.

539
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,320
- Bagheri?
- Yes...?

540
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
I mean, now...

541
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:17,400
you're not thinking
of finding a companion?

542
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,680
I don't want to remarry.

543
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,520
Why? You're all alone.

544
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:26,720
I lived with her for fifty years.
She gave me six children.

545
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,000
It wouldn't be right.

546
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,400
But your children
have left home now.

547
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:39,200
It would be nice for you
to have a companion.

548
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,000
My life's coming to an end...

549
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,720
You're joking,
you're in your prime!

550
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:53,000
A lot of women here have lost their husbands,
and a lot of husbands, their wives.

551
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,400
Maybe,
but I don't want to get married.

552
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:02,000
After fifty years with someone,

553
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:11,280
it's not right to remarry
for me at 60 or 65.

554
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,000
- Hossein!
- Yes?

555
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,960
- Bring me a clean dish!
- Right away.

556
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,880
Are you coming, Hossein?

557
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,920
We didn't look after our parents,
why should our children

558
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,400
look after us?
With their problems in Teheran.

559
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,760
Who do they do?
- They live in Teheran.

560
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,240
One works in an oil company,
Falate Gharreh.

561
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,040
Yes, I see...

562
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,800
He goes to the island of Lavan...

563
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,040
to the port of Guenaveh.

564
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,720
- That's a hot area.
- Hot?

565
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,040
Your other son who works
at the automobile association.

566
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,080
does he have children?

567
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,560
Yes, three.

568
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:35,280
And your two sons who are here,
what do they do?

569
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,520
They're drivers.

570
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:41,480
One drives a truck and
the other works at the town hall.

571
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,960
How did it go?

572
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,240
She refuses to listen.

573
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,960
She said
we hired her for one day.

574
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,360
and that she has to review
for exams.

575
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:55,720
I said: "No problem, bring
your book and study on the set."

576
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:59,080
Apparently, she doesn't want
to be with that boy.

577
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,040
She doesn't want to.

578
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:05,320
You have to change one or the other.

579
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:08,160
Either the girl or Hossein.

580
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:14,040
Hossein,
go and water those flowers!

581
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,680
- They've been parched for 2 days!
- You never said

582
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:19,080
- Who was it I told then?
- Mohammadi.

583
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,640
Mohammadi says
that I asked you

584
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:25,840
and you tell me
I asked it Mohammadi.

585
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,400
What do I have to do?

586
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:30,400
I'd have done it
if you'd asked.

587
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,400
- You forgot.
- I didn't!

588
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:37,000
I was a bit crafty.

589
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:40,280
I told her to hurry up
and decide.

590
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,520
or I'd go and fetch Poursadeghi.

591
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,880
She reacted immediately
and said:

592
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:48,040
"I'll see, come back tomorrow."

593
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:51,000
In any case,
I think we have to

594
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,440
change either one or the other.

595
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:56,120
The girl could cause problems later.

596
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,320
We'll find a solution.

597
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,720
What you were saying, Bagheri?

598
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,800
Hossein, get up.

599
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,400
Hossein, that's enough.
Wake up!

600
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,800
It's late,
you've got to wake up.

601
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,400
Hello, ma'am.

602
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,720
- Hello.
- Hello to you.

603
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,640
Hossein, it is very late.

604
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:34,920
Wake up!

605
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,640
You got up late too.
We want some tea.

606
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:40,960
- Hossein didn't let me sleep.
- Why not?

607
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:44,800
He was raving: "My white socks,
where are my white socks?"

608
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:49,040
With the wind, I couldn't sleep.
I had to put the bed outside.

609
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,840
Go and make some tea.
I'll wake the others.

610
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,400
Mr. Karimi?

611
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,600
- Hello.
- Hello.

612
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:21,440
- Hello, Mrs. Shiva.
- Hello.

613
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:24,480
- Is Mr. Rhafari up?
- Yes,  he's going jogging.

614
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,080
Mr. Samak Bachi?

615
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:30,040
It's very late.

616
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:33,000
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hello.

617
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:39,800
Mr. Jafarian?

618
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,320
I am awake.

619
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:49,040
- Mr. Jafarian?
- Hello.

620
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,320
Hello.

621
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,280
Mr. Kheradmand?

622
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,440
Yes, I'm here.

623
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:02,400
- Hello, Farhad.
- Hello, Mrs. Shiva.

624
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,840
If you don't need Hossein,

625
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,280
let him sleep a little.
He didn't sleep well, he's tired.

626
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,160
I don't understand.

627
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,040
I am awake!

628
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:22,760
Clear away the cups, wash them
and get our breakfast!

629
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:25,440
I am awake
and you say I'm sleeping!

630
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,200
Was I asleep?

631
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,600
Rectification...

632
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,920
Hossein was up early!

633
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:33,120
Okay!

634
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,720
Poor thing, he's worried.

635
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:41,200
Me too, I found it hard getting up.

636
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,440
Didn't you have a good night?

637
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,280
No, I had a sprung mattress.

638
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,280
My back hurt,

639
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,960
it was damp on the ground.

640
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:55,040
I spent the night as best I could.

641
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,480
But the pure morning air
makes it all worthwhile!

642
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:01,280
Here, breathing is a real pleasure.

643
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:05,960
I think they've all left
this place, haven't they?

644
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:08,880
Most of them were killed
in the earthquake

645
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,640
and the survivors moved away

646
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:14,920
to live along the side
of the highway in tiny houses.

647
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:19,480
They preferred the highway
to the pure air here?

648
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,160
I guess so...

649
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:23,480
They were right, poor things.

650
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:26,800
After the quake,
help couldn't reach them.

651
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,240
The roads were blocked
and many of them died.

652
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,960
The survivors left.

653
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:35,400
Besides... you can't live
on nothing but fresh air!

654
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:39,320
You need other things too and
you find them along the highway

655
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:42,480
And from there,
they can always move elsewhere.

656
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:44,760
That's why
12 million live in Teheran!

657
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:47,800
Let's stop churning out cliches.

658
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:51,360
I'd like to tell you something
about this place.

659
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:54,560
If you greet the souls
of the inhabitants of this place,

660
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:56,000
they answer you.

661
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,840
- Their souls?
- Yes.

662
00:47:58,520 --> 00:47:59,760
Hello.

663
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:03,000
If you say it that way,
only I can answer.

664
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,520
Say it a lot louder,
so they can hear.

665
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:07,040
Hello!

666
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,280
Did you hear?

667
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:13,440
- You're having me on.
- Why?

668
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,920
It's obvious, it's an echo.

669
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:18,520
If you think it's an echo,
say something else.

670
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:20,480
then you'll see if they reply.

671
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:22,160
What can I say?

672
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,360
Pouya! Pouya!

673
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:26,840
Yes, dad?

674
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:29,680
Nothing,
I wasn't talking to you!

675
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,840
One other thing: they only answer
to hello and good-bye.

676
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,120
Listen...

677
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:38,320
Good-bye!

678
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:44,080
And if you say good-bye
and then don't leave

679
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,080
they won't answer
your hello anymore!

680
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:48,640
Don't forget:
just hello and good-bye.

681
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,000
I'm going.

682
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:54,160
Farhad,

683
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:57,400
give this to Mr. Panahi.
I will catch up with you.

684
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:58,760
Good-bye.

685
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:46,720
Sit here in front.

686
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,960
I'll sit next to Hossein.

687
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,400
Everything okay, Hossein?

688
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,200
Yes, thank you.

689
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:00,120
- You don't look too happy.
- No, I am.

690
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,880
Maybe you're tired?

691
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:07,320
I hear you didn't sleep well
last night.

692
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,440
I did, but I fell asleep late.

693
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:13,080
You don't look like someone
who slept badly

694
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,600
but like someone who's upset.

695
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,160
Isn't that right?

696
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,280
No, I'm not upset.

697
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,080
Oh yes, you are.

698
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,400
You know, sir,

699
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:27,800
I don't like to speak ill
of others,

700
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:32,720
but inhabitants of dead Poshteh
are a lot friendlier

701
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:35,240
than little Miss Tahereh.

702
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:36,640
What do you mean?

703
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:41,240
When you greeted them
this morning at least they replied!

704
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:42,440
That's true.

705
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:46,080
I greeted her three times yesterday.
She never replied once.

706
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,720
Usually, you only say hello once.

707
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,160
If there's no reply,
you never say hello again.

708
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:53,920
- It's your fault.
- You're the one who asked me!

709
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,640
I told you to say it...

710
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,960
just once!

711
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:08,640
I thought
that by greeting her...

712
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:14,080
maybe she would reply...
She didn't reply.

713
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:16,800
I won't say hello
to her again either.

714
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:24,960
Whay about today?

715
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:27,880
Will she be there?

716
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:30,080
I don't know. Maybe...
Mrs. Shiva?

717
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:31,520
Yes?

718
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,480
Stop for these people.

719
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:40,920
Hossein, let them in.

720
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:23,120
Where were you coming from?

721
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,920
I don't speak your dialect.

722
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:26,680
We were at the public baths.

723
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:29,240
Where are the baths?

724
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:31,520
Beyond Chima.

725
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:37,280
There's another over there.
Why go so far?

726
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:41,640
There are shops there,
there's the bazaar...

727
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:46,520
There's a baker's
and our daughters come with us.

728
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:50,000
Isn't it hard for you
going all that way?

729
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:53,640
Maybe, but it's quieter
and it's better.

730
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:58,120
Won't you catch cold up here?

731
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:01,960
We are cold
but we have to get home.

732
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:04,960
The cold, the heat

733
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:06,440
don't bother us.

734
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:08,680
We can't change it,

735
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,320
even if it's hard.

736
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,960
Over there it's quieter,
that's why...

737
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:17,240
- Is she your daughter?
- Yes.

738
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:21,480
She doesn't look like you.

739
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:23,280
She looks like her brother.

740
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:28,000
Her brother
looks like his father, doesn't he?

741
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,840
So she must look like her father.

742
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:35,400
- Where's her father now?
- He's dead.

743
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:38,520
- During the earthquake?
- That's right.

744
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:41,880
God bless him...

745
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,120
Do you think

746
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:48,600
she'd like to be in our film?

747
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:52,920
- Do you want to be in our film?
- No.

748
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,480
- Why?
- She can't act.

749
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:58,240
It's not difficult...

750
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:01,280
She just has to wash dishes
near a spring!

751
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,360
Surely she can do that?

752
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:05,840
Couldn't you do that?

753
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:10,480
What's your name?

754
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:14,080
Look at me.

755
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:17,200
Excuse me, sir,

756
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:20,600
but here people don't give
the names of women or girls

757
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,960
to a stranger.
It's not our custom.

758
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,680
Tell me, are there still people
who live here?

759
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:38,360
Very few. Only those
who still have cattle and sheep.

760
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,960
The others have moved down
to the highway.

761
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:44,480
- Do you have cattle too?
- We've got nothing anymore.

762
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:45,760
Why stay then?

763
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:49,600
The edge of the highway
is no place to live.

764
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:51,440
It's not quiet.

765
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:55,000
Where do you come from?

766
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,000
We all come
from Taleche-Tolab.

767
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,560
- Taleche-Tolab?
- Yes.

768
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:01,880
Back there, we had flies,
tea plantations,

769
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:04,120
trees, rice fields, silk!

770
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:08,360
- Flies?
- Honey flies, yes.

771
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,680
We had to abandon everything
to come here.

772
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:13,360
But giving up this place

773
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:16,880
to live by the road on tarmac...
we couldn't do that.

774
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:19,480
Have you ever been
to Taleche-Tolab?

775
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,680
Taleche? No.

776
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:27,120
If you had, you wouldn't ask
why we won't move to the road!

777
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:30,120
It's no place to live.

778
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:34,280
All that smoke and asphalt
and people passing!

779
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:35,720
Indeed.

780
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:38,480
Thanks a lot,
this is where we get off.

781
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:39,720
Mrs. Shiva,

782
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,120
let them off here.

783
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:48,760
Grandmother,
give me your address.

784
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:50,280
We haven't got one!

785
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:53,600
Give it to me anyway,
we may need it later.

786
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:56,560
We haven't got an address.
Why do you want it?

787
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,440
- You'll see why.
- We haven't got an address anymore.

788
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:01,440
- Good-bye, sir.
- Good-bye.

789
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,400
Grandmother, come here.

790
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:04,600
Mrs. Shiva...

791
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:06,960
take down her address.

792
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:09,600
- Yes?
- Where do you live?

793
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:14,160
Nowhere! Over there...
behind the tree...

794
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:16,640
We haven't got a phone.
We're near the road.

795
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:19,960
- I don't want your phone number.
- I haven't got an address.

796
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:22,840
We live behind the tree.
Our tent is over there.

797
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,360
We've got no address, nothing.

798
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:28,760
- What's your name?
- Zahra Norouzi.

799
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:32,320
- If I need you, will you be there?
- Yes, yes.

800
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,800
- My house is over there.
- I'll come and fetch you.

801
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,240
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

802
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:56,080
What did you want that woman?

803
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:59,880
Her...
No, she doesn't interest me...

804
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:02,960
I was thinking of her daughter

805
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,480
for the scene at the spring.

806
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:06,600
If it doesn't work,

807
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:09,160
I've also got an idea about Hossein.

808
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,560
What do you think, Hossein?

809
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:15,200
Her? I'm not interested.

810
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:18,400
Why?
She's a charming girl.

811
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:22,880
Yes, she may be pretty,

812
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:24,360
but she's illiterate.

813
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:27,440
- How do you know that?
- These people are peasants.

814
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:29,120
They've had no education.

815
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:33,000
When I get married
and have children,

816
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:36,280
if my wife is illiterate like me,

817
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,680
who'll help the children
with their homework?

818
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:40,800
I see.

819
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:45,160
Maybe she'd get on better with you,
seeing as you're illiterate.

820
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:48,200
I don't know how to read,
so I have to

821
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:50,800
find someone who's educated,

822
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:54,760
and sociable too,
who can read and write,

823
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:57,520
so that one of us

824
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:00,920
can help the children
with their homework

825
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:03,320
and all their exams.

826
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:06,920
If we're both illiterate,

827
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,040
life will be impossible!

828
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:13,800
So you don't want her
because she's illiterate, is that it?

829
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:20,280
But Tahereh doesn't want you
for the same reason.

830
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:23,000
Why are you annoyed then?

831
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,160
I'm not annoyed!

832
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:29,200
Yes you are,
just a bit annoyed.

833
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:31,760
I think...

834
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:38,200
if land-owners married land-owners,
rich people married rich people...

835
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:42,840
and illiterates married illiterates,
nothing would work.

836
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:45,440
It's much better

837
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:48,320
if people who read
marry illiterates,

838
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:51,880
rich people marry poor people,

839
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:56,440
homeless people
marry land-owners.

840
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:58,280
So that everyone...

841
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:01,520
can help each other out.
I think that's better.

842
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:03,280
If two people marry

843
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:06,160
and end up with two houses,

844
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:09,840
they can't have their head in one
and their feet in the other!

845
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:13,000
Am I right or wrong?
They can't do that!

846
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:16,160
Indeed, they can't do that,

847
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:20,400
but they can live in one
and rent out the other, can't they?

848
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:21,800
Can't they?

849
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:27,880
That's possible.

850
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,000
Tahereh?

851
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:58,000
Miss Tahereh?

852
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:03,400
Grandmother?

853
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:49,560
Scene 14, shot 1, take 1

854
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:51,560
Action!

855
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:52,640
Tahereh...

856
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:56,120
Tahereh, where did you put
my white socks?

857
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:58,080
Look in your clothes,

858
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:00,760
I already looked,
they're not there.

859
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:02,960
Maybe near the fireplace.

860
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:05,080
They're not there either.

861
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:07,600
I don't know what you do
with my things!

862
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:10,280
I know!
You put them in your shoes!

863
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:12,720
I'll gladly go and look

864
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:16,520
but I know they're not there!

865
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:19,120
But since you say so, fine,

866
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:20,680
I'll go and look in my shoes...

867
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:27,480
Ah, the white socks are here!

868
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:31,640
You look
as if you just got married.

869
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:33,120
That's right!

870
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:35,640
- How long ago?
- Five days.

871
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:38,000
Five days or five months?

872
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:39,640
Five days!

873
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:43,040
- The night of the tremor?
- No...

874
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:44,520
One day later.

875
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:47,120
Hossein...

876
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:51,320
Why lower your head?
Stand up straight when you talk.

877
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:52,760
Let's do it again.

878
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:55,080
- Sound?
- Yes?

879
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:57,080
- Recording?
- Ready.

880
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:58,240
Camera!

881
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:00,560
Scene 14, shot 1, take 2.

882
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:01,720
Action!

883
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:04,800
Tahereh, where did you put
my white socks?

884
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:07,040
Look in your clothes.

885
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:11,760
I already looked,
they're not there.

886
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:15,440
- Maybe near the fireplace.
- I already looked.

887
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:17,960
I don't know what you do
with my things!

888
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:20,000
You must have put them
in your shoes!

889
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:24,320
I'm sure they're not there.
But since you say so, fine.

890
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:26,000
I'll go and look in my shoes...

891
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:27,960
But I know they're not there.

892
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:35,480
Ah, the white socks are here!

893
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:38,120
You look
as if you just got married.

894
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:39,840
Yes.

895
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:41,600
How long ago?

896
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:43,360
Five days.

897
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:47,680
- Five days or five months?
- Five days!

898
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:52,720
- The night of the tremor?
- No, one day later.

899
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:54,120
All right...

900
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:56,800
What's going on?

901
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:58,760
Hey, don't pour any water?

902
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:01,000
- I was watering the flowers.
- The flowers?

903
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:04,160
Look to see
if there's anyone below!

904
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:07,000
I'm not saying
not to water them!

905
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:10,520
- But look below first!
- Sorry!

906
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:14,640
So many people were buried
under the rubble,

907
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:17,720
a few drops of water on my head
won't harm me...

908
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:19,600
Don't yell at her!

909
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:25,440
There can't have been
many victims in your family...

910
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:28,920
for you to go and get married
the day after the quake.

911
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:32,040
There were. Cousins,
aunts, uncles...

912
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:36,000
All told,
there must be 25 dead...

913
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:37,320
Cut!

914
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:38,920
It's 65!

915
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:40,960
No, sir. I lost 25 people.

916
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:43,160
No, it's 65! Start again.

917
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:44,680
Hossein, get ready.

918
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:46,520
Ahmad, wait a second.

919
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:48,960
Go on, Ahmad,
go and sit over there.

920
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:50,880
Quick... Ready to  go?

921
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:53,360
Ready?

922
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:55,280
Faster!

923
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:57,360
They're rolling.

924
01:03:57,680 --> 01:03:58,800
Hossein, ready?

925
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:02,240
Wait a minute,
the sun's gone behind the clouds.

926
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:05,600
We'll have to wait five minutes.
Maybe less.

927
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:13,640
Excuse me, while we wait,
could you listen to this tape?

928
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:16,680
There's a noise.
Does it bother you?

929
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:20,400
Let me listen first.

930
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:25,720
Do you want a close shot?

931
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:28,480
Wait, I'm listening to the sound.

932
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:40,680
Tahereh...

933
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:44,320
When I ask about the socks,

934
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:47,320
don't go thinking it's me.
It's not.

935
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:50,520
It's what the director wants.

936
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:54,240
I am not the kind
who keeps asking:

937
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:57,000
"Where are my socks?"

938
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:00,680
If I get married,
I'll have enough tact...

939
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:04,400
to put away my socks,

940
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:09,080
my clothes and all my things!

941
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:12,920
I want to get married
simply to be happy,

942
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:16,080
not to have you cook for me

943
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:18,600
or look after my clothes

944
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:22,800
I'd like you to carry on studying
if you want to,

945
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:27,520
while I work
and go to eat at the bazaar.

946
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:31,280
The only thing I want...

947
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:37,560
is your happiness.
I want to make you happy.

948
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:40,200
Okay? We're ready.

949
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:43,200
Is your heart with me?

950
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:46,120
Tell me.

951
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,400
Scene 14, shot 1, scene 3

952
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:49,760
Action!

953
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:54,520
Why doesn't he start?

954
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:57,400
- Why don't you start?
- Tahereh!

955
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:00,320
Where did you put my socks?

956
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:02,280
Look in your clothes.

957
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:04,080
I already looked!

958
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:06,160
No, they're not there.

959
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,160
Maybe near the fireplace.

960
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:11,680
The fireplace?
No, they're not there either!

961
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:14,160
I don't know what you do
with my things!

962
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:16,200
Look in your shoes.

963
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:19,080
They're not in the shoes either,
but I'll check.

964
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:21,840
I know they're not there...

965
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,760
I'll gladly have a look,
but I'm sure they're not there.

966
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:27,360
Since you say so, fine.

967
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:32,040
Ah , they are here,
in the shoes.

968
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:36,440
You look
as if you just got married!

969
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:37,440
Yes.

970
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:39,160
How long ago?

971
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:40,840
Five days.

972
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:44,680
- Five days or five months?
- Five days!

973
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:49,840
The night of the tremor?

974
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,240
No, one day later.

975
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:58,160
Hey, don't pour any water!

976
01:06:58,320 --> 01:06:59,640
I was watering the flowers, sorry!

977
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:04,720
You can water them but check to see
if there's anyone below first!

978
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:06,880
- Sorry!
- It doesn't matter!

979
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:09,320
So many people were buried
under the rubble,

980
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:12,520
a few drops of water on my head
won't harm me...

981
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:16,680
Tell me...

982
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:19,520
There can't have been
many victims

983
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:22,000
in your family
if you got married the day after.

984
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:24,040
There were. Cousins,

985
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:27,000
aunts, uncles...
All told,

986
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:29,160
there must be 25 dead...

987
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:32,400
Not! Not 25! 65!

988
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:35,800
- You have to say 65 people.
- 65?

989
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:38,960
But I swear I only lost 25!

990
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:40,360
Well say 65 anyway.

991
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:43,840
- We need new film.
- Hossein, ready?

992
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,200
Go back up.

993
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:49,560
Esmail, untie the ropes.
We'll put the canvas away.

994
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:51,600
The shadow has to be there.

995
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:06,720
Mrs. Shiva,
some paper, please. Thank you.

996
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:10,520
Whose pen is this?

997
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:24,520
We haven't yet had
the chance to laugh

998
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:26,120
or talk together.

999
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:31,440
I've only spoken to your mother
and your grandmother.

1000
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:35,640
But old people don't understand

1001
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:39,400
what young people feel.
They've forgotten their youth.

1002
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:43,560
I want to know... if your heart...

1003
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:46,080
is with me or not.

1004
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:50,640
That's right.

1005
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:55,520
read your book and
don't pay any attention to them.

1006
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:59,960
They're busy directing.
They're not bothered about us.

1007
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:03,160
If you dare not say yes

1008
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:07,640
turn the page of your book,
that will be my reply

1009
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:18,320
The problem, I think, is the house.

1010
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:21,520
So I'll go andl see the owner

1011
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:23,480
and talk to him

1012
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:25,880
so that he'll give me this house.

1013
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:28,960
It won't cost a lot.

1014
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,240
We'll be able to live here

1015
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:35,040
because it brings us luck.

1016
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:37,440
Ever since we got here,

1017
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:39,800
flowers have bloomed inside,

1018
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,040
flowers to wish us welcome.

1019
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:48,400
We don't need
this sack of plaster anymore.

1020
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:50,680
We've done that shot.

1021
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:57,000
I'll ask them for that plaster
and buy two other sacks.

1022
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:59,840
I can turn this house

1023
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:02,480
into a very beautiful place.

1024
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:04,440
I'll put a window over there.

1025
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:06,800
When you wake in the morning,

1026
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:09,560
and the mountains
you'll see opposite

1027
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:12,160
and mountains of opposite

1028
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:14,120
will make your heart joyful.

1029
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:17,920
I swore that I'd never do
any more masonry again.

1030
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:20,800
If I have to do it,
it will be only for you.

1031
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:24,920
But I want to know
if your heart is with me.

1032
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,680
Don't worry about the others.

1033
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:32,320
If you turn a page,

1034
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:34,200
I'll have my reply.

1035
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:46,960
Mr. Jafarian, we're shooting.
Ready?

1036
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:48,240
Sound.

1037
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:50,200
Camera.

1038
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:53,080
Scene 14, shot 1, take 4

1039
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:54,320
Action!

1040
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:58,680
- Hossein! Hossein!
- Yes.

1041
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:02,040
Why don't you say anything?
Are you asleep? Go on, speak.

1042
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:03,720
Tahereh!

1043
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:06,120
Where are my white socks?

1044
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:08,360
Look in your clothes.

1045
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:11,880
I already looked.
They're not there.

1046
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:14,120
Maybe near the fireplace.

1047
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:15,880
They're not there.

1048
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:18,520
I don't know what you do
with my things!

1049
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:21,000
You must have put them
in your shoes.

1050
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:22,960
In my shoes?
I don't think so.

1051
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:25,440
But since you say so, fine.

1052
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,880
I'll go and look in my shoes.
Okay.

1053
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:33,400
Oh! They are in my shoes!

1054
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:38,360
You look
as if you just got married.

1055
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:39,520
Yes.

1056
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:40,880
How long ago?

1057
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:42,600
Five days.

1058
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:44,840
Five days or five months?

1059
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,320
Five days!

1060
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:49,600
You mean the night of the tremor?

1061
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:52,960
One day later.

1062
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,840
Hey, stop pouring water!

1063
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,480
Sorry, I was watering the flowers.

1064
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:04,240
You can water them,
but check if there's anyone below!

1065
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:05,680
All right. Sorry.

1066
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:09,120
Don't yell at her. So many people
were buried under the rubble,

1067
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:11,440
a few drop of water on my head

1068
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,440
won't harm me...

1069
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:17,560
There can't have been
many victims

1070
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:21,600
in your family for you
to get married the day after.

1071
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:23,480
There were.
Cousins,

1072
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:25,600
aunts, uncles...
All toldl,

1073
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:27,800
they must be 65 dead...

1074
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:30,520
I thought,
if I wait for the elders' approval,

1075
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:32,560
one will say to wait

1076
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:37,200
until the third day of mourning,
another the seventh day,

1077
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:39,320
another the fortieth,

1078
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:43,200
or even the whole year!

1079
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:46,320
If we'd listened to them,
we'd have had to wait a long time.

1080
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:49,080
So we decided to marry,
to come here.

1081
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:50,960
and get it over with.

1082
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:52,760
- You brought her here?
- Yes...

1083
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:54,080
No, not here...

1084
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:56,280
We've been her three days.

1085
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:59,360
At first, we lived under
a sheet of palastic.

1086
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:01,600
What? A sheet of palastic?

1087
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:03,040
You mean plastic?

1088
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:06,720
I had bought 20 yards
of palastic for the rice fields.

1089
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:08,600
I used it for something else.

1090
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:11,320
I stuck four feet in the ground
and, with the palastic,

1091
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:14,040
made a roof to protect us
from the rain.

1092
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:16,080
And we moved in beneath it.

1093
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:18,320
- It was your wedding room?
- Yes.

1094
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:23,680
- What did you do after?
- What did you do after?

1095
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:26,800
- For food?
- For food?

1096
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:29,760
Well, we didn't have
any plates or things left.

1097
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:31,880
I thought we'd go and look

1098
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:34,440
at the place where we used to live

1099
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:37,760
to see if I could find any.

1100
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:40,080
I looked through the rubble

1101
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:44,000
and I found a pot,
a plate and a couple of spoons.

1102
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:46,400
We washed them...

1103
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:49,280
and brought them back
to our palastic shelter.

1104
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:51,200
Then I went to the bazaar,

1105
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:55,400
to see if I could find
something to eat.

1106
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:58,000
I saw two trucks
from the emergency services

1107
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:01,440
parked alongside the highway.

1108
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:04,520
One was giving out tents
and the other tomatoes.

1109
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:08,680
We got there too late for the tents,

1110
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:10,640
but we managed to get
a few tomatoes.

1111
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:12,560
We washed them.

1112
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:16,080
I made myself a wooden skewer

1113
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:19,480
and I put the tomatoes on it.

1114
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:21,440
I grilled them and we ate them.

1115
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:23,640
- As your wedding banquet?
- Yes...

1116
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:25,120
Cut!

1117
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:29,840
That was good. We've finished.
Thank you, everybody.

1118
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:32,560
Hossein, do us a favour
and bring us some tea.

1119
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:51,600
- Have some.
- No thank you.

1120
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,320
Reza, bring that box over.

1121
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:42,440
This is how it'll be.

1122
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:46,760
Sometimes, I'll serve the tea,

1123
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:48,280
sometimes you.

1124
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:50,280
That's the way...

1125
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:54,200
I see married life.

1126
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:58,560
That's what life is!

1127
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:00,080
- Hossein!
- Yes?

1128
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:02,840
Mr. Nazari?

1129
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:08,600
Put one of the flower-pots here.
These are too dry.

1130
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:23,040
Hossein, come and give us a hand.

1131
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:25,560
Hossein is tired,
let him rest.

1132
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:31,200
Mr. Hossein won't dirty his hands
with shovels and bricks.

1133
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:34,440
We shouldn't either.

1134
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:37,560
He's decided not to be

1135
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:38,720
a mason anymore.

1136
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:40,440
Mrs. Shiva is right.

1137
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:43,800
I swore I'd never
do that work again.

1138
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:47,640
If I ever do it again,
it will be only for you.

1139
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:50,560
It's not a bad job these days.

1140
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:55,760
I could easily make 1,500 tomans
a day more than a doctor.

1141
01:17:56,360 --> 01:17:59,640
1,500 toumans a day,
that's 45,000 toumans a month.

1142
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:02,480
We can put by 10,000 tomans
for your study fees

1143
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:05,760
and transport and we can keep...

1144
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:07,160
- Hossein?
- Yes.

1145
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:08,920
- Where are you?
- Here.

1146
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:11,400
- Where's your jacket?
- It's downstairs.

1147
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:13,200
- Go and put it on.
- All right.

1148
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:14,920
- Faster than that.
- All right.

1149
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:17,160
Are you ready?

1150
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:19,360
- Start the sound.
- Recording.

1151
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:20,720
Camera.

1152
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:23,720
- Scene 14, shot 2, take 1.
- Action!

1153
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:32,080
Did they know,
the people who died?

1154
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:34,720
Well, as long as we're living,

1155
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:36,280
we have to start a family.

1156
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:38,560
Perhaps the next quake
will kill us all too.

1157
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:41,360
- Am I wrong, sir?
- No.

1158
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:45,760
Look, you forgot this.

1159
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:51,360
Cut!

1160
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:54,240
Why "look"?
He's got a name, hasn't he?

1161
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:55,920
"Mr. Hossein."

1162
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:58,960
Say : "Mr. Hossein, you forgot this."
That's all.

1163
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:00,160
Do it again.

1164
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:02,320
Scene 14, shot 2, take 2.

1165
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:03,720
Action!

1166
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:06,920
Did they know,
the people who died?

1167
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:10,480
Well, as long as we're living,
we have to start a family.

1168
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:13,040
Perhaps the next quake
will kill us all too.

1169
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:16,240
- Am I wrong, sir?
- No, you're right.

1170
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:19,160
Hossein, you forgot this.

1171
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:25,480
He hasn't held his hand out yet,
so why are you doing it?

1172
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:30,040
Miss Tahereh,
not "Hossein", but "Mr. Hossein".

1173
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:31,520
Do it again.

1174
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:34,680
- Ready?
- Sound.

1175
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:37,360
- Recording.
- Camera.

1176
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:39,720
Shot 2, take 3

1177
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:41,040
Action!

1178
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:43,920
Did they know,
the people who died?

1179
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:47,480
Well, as long as we're living,
we have to start a family.

1180
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:49,840
Perhaps the next quake
will kill us all too.

1181
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:53,360
- Am I wrong, sir?
- No, you're right.

1182
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:56,360
Hossein, you forgot this.

1183
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:57,720
Cut!

1184
01:19:57,960 --> 01:20:00,520
Why "Hossein"?
You have to say "Mr.Hossein"!

1185
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:02,720
How many times
do I have to tell you?

1186
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:04,600
Shot 2, take 4

1187
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:08,120
Did they know,
the people who died?

1188
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:11,840
Well, as long as we're living,
we have to start a family.

1189
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:14,720
Perhaps the next quake
will kill us all too.

1190
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:18,080
- An I wrong, sir?
- No, you're right.

1191
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Hossein, you forgot this.

1192
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:23,000
Cut!

1193
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:25,320
Tahereh,
you said "Hossein" again!

1194
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:28,400
I already told you.
You have to say "Mr. Hossein".

1195
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:30,360
Shot 2, take 5.

1196
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:34,240
Did they know,
those which died?

1197
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:37,440
Well, as long as we're living,
we have to start a family.

1198
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:40,800
Perhaps the next quake
will kill us all too.

1199
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:43,120
- Am I wrong, sir?
- No, you're right.

1200
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:45,680
Hossein, you forgot this.

1201
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:53,440
Cut!

1202
01:20:57,080 --> 01:20:58,680
She still didn't say it!

1203
01:21:04,040 --> 01:21:05,040
Excuse me, sir,

1204
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:06,040
do you know

1205
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:07,760
some women here

1206
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:11,440
no longer call
their husbands "Mr."?

1207
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:16,000
Miss Tahereh
cannot manage to say it either.

1208
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:20,400
I don't think it will seem
implausible in the film.

1209
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:24,200
No, it won't seem implausbile.

1210
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:25,360
- One more time?
- No.

1211
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:26,720
- Is that a wrap?
- Yes.

1212
01:21:26,959 --> 01:21:30,059
Thanks, guys.
Let's clear everything away.

1213
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:32,040
Thank you, Mr. Jafarian.

1214
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:36,080
Hossein, put the glasses in the car.
It's getting late.

1215
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:39,160
Tahereh, pick up your book.
It's over.

1216
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:40,840
- For me?
- Yes.

1217
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:43,600
You won't say
your lines properly.

1218
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:46,320
Where are the Ahmadpour boys?

1219
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:51,720
Put your flower pots in the car.

1220
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:54,480
Tahereh, take your flower-pot too.

1221
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:00,640
Do you know which one it is?
Don't take somebody else's.

1222
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:04,120
Hurry...
Pick up your flower-pots.

1223
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:07,640
Wait, let Tahereh come down first.

1224
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:10,840
Put them in the back.

1225
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:12,720
We're leaving now.

1226
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:15,320
Run, children, hurry.

1227
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:20,720
Can't you find your flower-pots?

1228
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:23,560
How many did you have, Babak?

1229
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:26,840
- I had two.
- Don't dawdle, come on.

1230
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:29,040
It had two red flowers.
It's not here!

1231
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:30,840
Look for it then, but hurry.

1232
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:33,600
Isn't it the one on the corner?

1233
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:36,360
There. Take it,
there on the corner.

1234
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:38,920
Careful you don't break the stem.

1235
01:22:43,480 --> 01:22:46,400
Put it in the back somewhere.

1236
01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:51,760
Where's Mr. Nazari?

1237
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:59,960
- Is the minibus here yet?
- It's on its way.

1238
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:03,840
Tahereh, put it in the back
and then sit down, I'm coming.

1239
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:23,320
Hossein, change your shoes
and put the flower-pots away.

1240
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:24,520
All right.

1241
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:27,560
Let's take down the canvas.

1242
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:35,080
Hossein, do me a favour,

1243
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:38,400
untie the ropes.
We're putting the canvas away.

1244
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:40,000
All right, sir.

1245
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:42,480
Can you serve us some tea?

1246
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:45,120
I just did!

1247
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:48,000
Yes, but Reza drank my cup.

1248
01:23:50,160 --> 01:23:53,200
Guys, Hossein's tired,
leave him alone.

1249
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:57,920
Put the glasses in the car
and get in.

1250
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:01,920
Mr. Karimi,
don't put that in the car.

1251
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:03,800
Wait for the minibus.

1252
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:08,360
But there won't be room
in the minibus.

1253
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:09,800
What do we do, Mr. Panahi?

1254
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:12,880
Let the children go first,
the minibus will soon be here.

1255
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:16,160
Let the children go first,
the minibus will soon be here.

1256
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:18,800
We have to be organized
and professional.

1257
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:21,120
Three people can take the minibus,

1258
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:24,600
with the flower-pots on their knees
and still be comfortable.

1259
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:28,080
Your things weren't that heavy!

1260
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:30,720
Why didn't you sort something out
with Jafarian?

1261
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:35,480
Let's be professional!

1262
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:41,400
Why all this gear?

1263
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:45,000
In case it rains.

1264
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:48,160
We have to consider
every possibility.

1265
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:05,440
The children have got exams,
take them back quickly.

1266
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:26,400
Mrs. Shiva?

1267
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:32,080
Mr. Panahi...

1268
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:36,840
The girl has gone!

1269
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:38,920
- Who has gone?
- Tahereh.

1270
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:47,840
Tahereh, wait, we'll drive you back.
It's a long way.

1271
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,360
I know a short-cut.

1272
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:52,040
The minibus will be here
in 5 minutes.

1273
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:06,680
Hossein, can't you see
we're arguing over transport?

1274
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:09,560
You're young, you can walk.
Go on!

1275
01:26:54,640 --> 01:26:55,680
Tahereh!

1276
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:14,240
Miss Tahereh...
I might not see you again.

1277
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:16,120
If you want to give me a reply,

1278
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:17,680
give it to me now.

1279
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:22,240
No, don't listen
to your grandmother.

1280
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:24,240
Old women only ever think

1281
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:29,440
of rich men,
who own houses and factories.

1282
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,600
They only think of them.

1283
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:38,800
But intelligence and understanding
are important too.

1284
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:42,720
You haven't got a father or mother.
You need a good husband.

1285
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:45,960
Not just any old crook
or any old fool.

1286
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:49,480
I really want to live with you.
I'm not trying to trick you.

1287
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:52,560
God is my witness,
it's not your beauty.

1288
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:56,080
nor anything else,
I just want you to have...

1289
01:27:56,280 --> 01:27:59,520
a place in life,
so that you don't have to worry.

1290
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:02,680
Come on, let's live together,
hand in hand.

1291
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:04,680
Answer me

1292
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:08,280
You've got a tongue!
The good Lord gave you

1293
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:10,720
a tongue to give an answer
to someone like me.

1294
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:18,560
If you don't want to answer,

1295
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:21,800
then I want an explanation
about that look you gave me

1296
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:23,520
at the cemetery.

1297
01:28:23,680 --> 01:28:26,640
That look that drew me to you
and made me follow you

1298
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:29,200
all this time
to get an answer from you.

1299
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:32,440
I want your reply,
not your grandmother's.

1300
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:35,560
I don't want to speak to her again,
I don't want to see her.

1301
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:38,640
When she got married,

1302
01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:41,240
or when your parents
- God bless them -

1303
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:44,720
got married,
did they have a house? No!

1304
01:28:45,160 --> 01:28:48,720
We're going to work too,
we're going to build our house too.

1305
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:52,560
Your grandmother says
without a house, I won't find a wife.

1306
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:56,480
I'll work and, little by little,
I'll have a house too.

1307
01:28:56,640 --> 01:28:58,360
I'm just as capable as anyone else.

1308
01:28:58,840 --> 01:29:01,400
I'm no worse than anyone else
and I say

1309
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:04,400
we can live together,
and people will envy us!

1310
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:06,360
We're just as good as anyone else!

1311
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:09,040
Who had a house around here?
Ask anyone!

1312
01:29:09,240 --> 01:29:12,760
Did they have a house
when they got married?

1313
01:29:13,240 --> 01:29:15,120
Even rich people,

1314
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:18,480
when they get married,
don't have a house.

1315
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:21,040
They move in with their parents

1316
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:23,360
for a while and find a house.

1317
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:25,720
You have to work hard.
You have to be brave.

1318
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:28,440
The director said it.

1319
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:30,480
The people who died,

1320
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:33,080
did they know?

1321
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:35,040
He must know

1322
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:38,080
He studied in the city.

1323
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:41,000
In Teheran.
That's a big city.

1324
01:29:41,320 --> 01:29:43,880
He studied.
He knows what he's talking about.

1325
01:29:44,120 --> 01:29:47,120
Listen to him.
It's logical.

1326
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:48,720
You have to admit it.

1327
01:29:48,920 --> 01:29:50,640
And even if you don't agree,

1328
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:53,080
say something!
React!

1329
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:56,000
Give me an answer today

1330
01:29:56,160 --> 01:29:58,680
The shoot is over
and I won't see you again.

1331
01:29:58,840 --> 01:30:01,480
If you don't answer today,

1332
01:30:01,680 --> 01:30:03,560
I won't bother you anymore.

1333
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:05,200
Give me your answer.

1334
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:07,880
If you love me, say:
"Yes, I love you"!

1335
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:11,680
If you don't,
explain that look,

1336
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:14,120
that look you gave me
in the cemetery.

1337
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:16,840
Since that look,
I've been following you.

1338
01:30:17,480 --> 01:30:20,080
I've been saying to myself
that you want me,

1339
01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:22,640
but that you're scared
of your grandmother!

1340
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:25,800
Some girls
are more beautiful than you!

1341
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:28,320
Better than you!

1342
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:30,640
I could marry one, but I won't!

1343
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:32,840
I want to marry you,

1344
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:35,320
you who have
neither father nor mother.

1345
01:30:35,480 --> 01:30:37,920
What are you thinking?
You're not speaking.

1346
01:30:40,360 --> 01:30:44,320
At least give me
the flower-pot to carry.

1347
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:46,960
If I'd known it was yours,

1348
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:49,400
I'd have watered it.
I wouldn't have let

1349
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:51,600
Mohammad touch it.

1350
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:57,200
Have you got
a heart of stone or what?

1351
01:30:58,600 --> 01:31:00,240
Your heart's made of stone!

1352
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:29,800
Do you only think
of the way you look?

1353
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:31,800
I'm just doing it for you,

1354
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:33,920
to give you a future.

1355
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:36,000
Hossein can have plenty of women...

1356
01:31:36,160 --> 01:31:37,760
I can find one anywhere.

1357
01:31:45,720 --> 01:31:48,720
Tahereh, please, answer me.

1358
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:50,400
If someone saw us together,

1359
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:53,480
he'd think we were betrothed.

1360
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:55,160
He'd never guess

1361
01:31:55,161 --> 01:31:58,161
that you won't reply
or that you haven't got a tongue!
