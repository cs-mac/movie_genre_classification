<i>Kazakhstan...October 4th, 1957...</i>

2
00:00:47,934 --> 00:00:51,434
<i>A Soviet Vostok rocket thrusts its way
through the clouds...</i>

3
00:00:51,434 --> 00:00:53,026
<i>...towards Earth orbit...</i>

4
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:59,823
<i>There, it delivers Sputnik...
a tiny man-made satellite...</i>

5
00:00:59,823 --> 00:01:01,951
<i>...and the Age of Space was born.</i>

6
00:01:03,936 --> 00:01:06,418
<i>A Soviet triumph that amazed the world...</i>

7
00:01:06,418 --> 00:01:08,758
<i>...and stunned the Americans.</i>

8
00:01:13,145 --> 00:01:16,490
<i>Two months later, came a Sputnik
6 times as heavy...</i>

9
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:19,731
<i>...with a passenger...
a dog named Laika.</i>

Hey...dog-face...!
Show us ya snatch!

11
00:02:03,803 --> 00:02:06,107
<i>I'm hanging around that same old scene...</i>

<i>My girlfriend Betsy, she's just fourteen...</i>

13

<i>There's nothing better for me to do...</i>

14
00:02:13,837 --> 00:02:17,357
<i>I'm living on dog food...So what?</i>

15
00:02:23,645 --> 00:02:26,217
<i>Dog food is so good for you...</i>

16
00:02:26,915 --> 00:02:29,537
<i>It makes you strong and clever too...</i>

17
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,942
<i>Dog food is a current craze</i>

18
00:02:33,933 --> 00:02:35,400
<i>Eat some every day...</i>

19

...hit me on the head...

20
00:02:38,455 --> 00:02:40,903
...I think I've got brain damage.

21
00:03:23,547 --> 00:03:25,108
...And when do the tickets go on sale?

22
00:03:25,108 --> 00:03:26,543
Tomorrow!

23
00:03:26,543 --> 00:03:27,582
And who are the tickets for?

24
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,476
David Bowie!

25
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,165
Oi! You!...

26
00:03:46,165 --> 00:03:49,652

29
00:03:57,322 --> 00:03:58,984
Yeah...you!

30
00:03:58,984 --> 00:04:01,559
Are you from the planet 'Poofter'?...

31
00:04:01,594 --> 00:04:03,425
Or the planet 'Stupider'?

32
00:04:03,425 --> 00:04:05,453
Think carefully before answering, Sammy.

33
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:08,604
I'll knock your fuckin' block off!

34
00:04:12,135 --> 00:04:13,297
Didn't you hear me?

35
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:18,340
I asked you a question,
prick-face!

36
00:04:18,924 --> 00:04:20,291
I said...

37
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:21,406
'Poofter'.

38
00:04:22,168 --> 00:04:23,895
Or just stupid!

39
00:04:26,089 --> 00:04:26,756
Eh?!

00:04:35,661 --> 00:04:37,183
Why don't you fuck off!?

45
00:04:37,183 --> 00:04:39,096
No one asked YOU...
plain-face!

46
00:04:39,096 --> 00:04:40,257
Easy!

47
00:04:43,203 --> 00:04:45,603
Coward or somethin'?
What's the matter with ya?

48
00:04:45,603 --> 00:04:46,610
Come on...get up!

Let's get the fuck outta here!

52
00:04:59,488 --> 00:05:00,882
You fuckin' moll!

53
00:05:00,882 --> 00:05:02,437
Fuckin' moll!

54
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:05,649
Look at me fuckin' head!
I got a fuckin' bleeder there!

55
00:05:21,744 --> 00:05:23,522
Let's hear it for Frankie Teardrop!

56
00:05:23,522 --> 00:05:25,489
Frankie's gonna make it!

57

You!

58
00:05:31,311 --> 00:05:33,855
Frankie Teardrop is gone!

59
00:05:45,218 --> 00:05:47,659

<i>...Irish band in stereo...</i>

<i>OK thanks, Gavin...I've gotta say...</i>

00:07:05,786 --> 00:07:07,320
Oops...sorry...!

See ya!

80
00:07:08,368 --> 00:07:09,114
Have you still got the phone?

81
00:07:09,717 --> 00:07:11,448
You wouldn't know, anyway.

82
00:07:13,551 --> 00:07:14,770
Not another one!

Good morning, Sammy!

87
00:08:27,932 --> 00:08:29,789
Did ya have a good kip
on the stairs there?

88
00:08:48,506 --> 00:08:50,230
Yes, little fella...it's food!

89
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,629
It's been a long time since you've seen
anything like this, hasn't it?

90
00:08:52,229 --> 00:08:54,387
You weed!

91
00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:07,056
Better watch out, Sammy...

92
00:09:07,056 --> 00:09:08,999
You'll get healthy eating
all THAT crap!

93
00:09:09,793 --> 00:09:10,727
You're right!

94
00:09:17,331 --> 00:09:18,513
Brains...

95
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,261
That's TV, Sammy...

96
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,757
That's what you watch
when you got no brain...

97
00:09:27,757 --> 00:09:29,504
...like you and me.

98
00:09:33,015 --> 00:09:36,802
<i>The physical contour of the RTL2 interests me
much less than the success of the whole operation.</i>

99
00:09:36,802 --> 00:09:39,116
Haven't you got your glasses with you,
little fella?

100
00:09:39,116 --> 00:09:40,453
You're blind as a bat, aren't ya?

101
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:57,974
Careful you don't
get any sun on you, sonny...

102
00:09:57,974 --> 00:09:59,655
You'll shrivel up and die!

103
00:10:32,968 --> 00:10:35,317
Sammy?...Sammy No-brains...

104
00:10:35,317 --> 00:10:36,023
I remember you...

105
00:10:36,023 --> 00:10:37,925
Didn't I just see you a moment ago
in the kitchen?

106
00:10:38,725 --> 00:10:40,277
What's this you've got here?

107
00:10:40,277 --> 00:10:41,731
It's a THING.

108
00:10:41,731 --> 00:10:42,709
Hmm...

109
00:10:43,286 --> 00:10:44,492
It's a girl, Sammy.

110
00:10:44,492 --> 00:10:46,354
Never seen one of THEM before...
have ya?!

111
00:10:47,654 --> 00:10:48,860
Hello little fella...

112
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,218
Where are YOU from?

113
00:10:56,278 --> 00:10:57,347
It's NOT a girl!

114
00:10:57,347 --> 00:11:00,137
I've seen girls before...
and they don't look like that.

115
00:11:00,137 --> 00:11:02,448
Want a bite
of my fairy-toast?

116
00:11:05,501 --> 00:11:09,104

126
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:26,772
Inconsiderate arseholes!

127
00:13:51,224 --> 00:13:52,510
Lock the door!

128
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:54,067
Lock the door?
It's falling open...

129
00:13:56,056 --> 00:13:56,730
Just got to put my lipstick on!

130
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:58,153
What for?
You've got enough on already.

131
00:13:58,154 --> 00:13:59,370
No...there's not enough.

132
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:01,655
- It looks fine!   - Are you sure?
- Come on, hurry up.

133
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:08,038
You want a tug?

134
00:14:08,038 --> 00:14:09,662
No...!

135
00:14:13,576 --> 00:14:15,473
Hey, Jen...you want some love?

136
00:14:16,295 --> 00:14:16,517
Yeah.

137
00:14:16,518 --> 00:14:17,518
Good old Jenny!

138
00:14:19,351 --> 00:14:22,270
Someone's been fucking using this
for making skag.

139
00:14:22,271 --> 00:14:23,271
Tim.

140
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,319
There you are, Jen...

141
00:14:33,319 --> 00:14:35,299
Oh...thanks.

142
00:14:35,299 --> 00:14:36,098
Hiya, Luchio...

143
00:14:36,098 --> 00:14:37,812
Been building any bridges lately?

144
00:14:37,812 --> 00:14:40,752
Ah...Come on, guys...
Stop giving me a hard time!

145
00:14:43,227 --> 00:14:44,676
What have you got here?

146
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:46,632
Constructional engineering.

147
00:14:46,632 --> 00:14:49,315
How do you understand
all those wiggly things?

148
00:14:49,315 --> 00:14:51,348
Easy...I've  done it before...

149
00:14:53,316 --> 00:14:54,691
See what the government
has done?

150
00:14:56,806 --> 00:14:58,596
Look at what the mad man is doing?

151
00:14:59,429 --> 00:15:02,917
Totally ignored Land Rights.
Causing mass unemployment.

152
00:15:02,917 --> 00:15:05,723
Poverty.  Infringement
of people's personal rights.

153
00:15:05,723 --> 00:15:07,061
Spent a mega-fortune on defence.

154
00:15:07,061 --> 00:15:09,202
And now he's cutting back  
on social welfare.

155
00:15:09,202 --> 00:15:11,115
Oh, no...Chuck's here!

156
00:15:13,001 --> 00:15:14,205
How's it going...
you hippy bastards?!

157
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:15,487
One bloody thing only...

158
00:15:15,487 --> 00:15:18,299
Fascist dictatorship...
and a police state!

159
00:15:19,389 --> 00:15:20,476
How are you going, punk rock?

160
00:15:20,476 --> 00:15:22,111
That's 2 things!

161
00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:33,807
Hello Barry...how's it going?

162
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:35,770
Fightin' the fuckin' revolution, mate.

163
00:15:36,764 --> 00:15:37,310
Have a bong.

164
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:41,025
- Feels beautiful!...So fluffy!
- Thank you.

165
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:43,888
- 'bye
- 'bye!

166
00:15:43,889 --> 00:15:44,889
Women and blacks are the load.

167
00:15:49,977 --> 00:15:51,390
- Hi Anna.
- Hi Anthony.

168
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,169
How's work?

169
00:15:52,169 --> 00:15:54,118
Oh, you know...a bit depressing.

170
00:15:54,118 --> 00:15:55,572
My favorite patient died today.

171
00:15:55,572 --> 00:15:57,123
- Oh, really?!
- Yeah.

172
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:58,828
I used to work in a nursing-home.

173
00:15:58,828 --> 00:16:00,468
- A while ago.
- Did you?

174
00:16:02,382 --> 00:16:04,800
It's really sad actually, the way
they're put away like that...

175
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,243
Some of them are so cluey.

176
00:16:06,243 --> 00:16:07,145
Yeah...I know what you mean...

177
00:16:07,145 --> 00:16:10,141
- I met some amazing characters.
- Fuck off Sam, I'm trying to talk.

178
00:16:10,141 --> 00:16:10,804
There was this old guy in there...

179
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:12,786
He was a vaudeville actor
from Hollywood.

180
00:16:12,786 --> 00:16:13,940
He was ancient!

181
00:16:15,218 --> 00:16:16,394
Fuck!

182
00:16:16,394 --> 00:16:17,139
Stop it!

183
00:16:17,139 --> 00:16:17,995
There was this one guy...

184
00:16:17,995 --> 00:16:19,996
He was an old vaudeville actor
from Hollywood...

185
00:16:19,996 --> 00:16:20,606
Yeah?

186
00:16:20,606 --> 00:16:21,559
He was really ancient.

187
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:23,000
He must have been
well over 80.

188
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,529
He came out here
in the thirties...

189
00:16:25,001 --> 00:16:27,346
He knew people like Douglas Fairbanks

190
00:16:27,346 --> 00:16:28,540
...and Charlie Chaplin.

191
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,173
He's an amazing character.

192
00:16:30,173 --> 00:16:31,338
Leave me alone!

193
00:16:32,812 --> 00:16:33,732
Come here!

194
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:36,093
Find many beer-bottle tops?

195
00:16:39,314 --> 00:16:40,212
Stop it!

196
00:16:40,212 --> 00:16:42,976
Yeah...he knew people
like Charlie Chaplin and Douglas Fairbanks.

197
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,039
Say 'three'!

198
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:46,597
Three!

199
00:16:46,597 --> 00:16:47,663
Say Meryl Streep.

200
00:16:47,663 --> 00:16:48,396
Fuck off!

201
00:16:50,348 --> 00:16:51,995
You only care about yourself.

202
00:16:51,995 --> 00:16:52,947
I do not!

203
00:16:52,947 --> 00:16:54,674
I've written a song
about you, Clare.

204
00:16:54,674 --> 00:16:56,081
Oh yeah...
What's it called?

205
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:56,950
'Brick Woman'

206
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,146
Oh...thanks a lot!

207
00:16:58,146 --> 00:16:58,947
He was incredible...

208
00:16:58,947 --> 00:17:00,081
- ...he'd just ramble...
- Why's it called that?

209
00:17:00,113 --> 00:17:01,671
Coz you're a BRICK!

210
00:17:01,671 --> 00:17:03,184
Anyway, I used to get round
into the wards...

211
00:17:03,184 --> 00:17:04,692
Hi guys...what's happening?

212
00:17:04,692 --> 00:17:08,024
Show it to me!

213
00:17:08,024 --> 00:17:09,952
Come on Charles!

214
00:17:12,262 --> 00:17:14,100
I remember when I had a girlfriend...

215
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,817
Boy, those were the days, eh, Luch...

216
00:17:15,817 --> 00:17:18,732
More sex than you could
poke a stick at...Sorry Jenny.

217
00:17:20,652 --> 00:17:22,161
Did someone here say 'Ballarat'?

218
00:17:22,161 --> 00:17:24,879
- You guys can really fuck.
- No you can't!

219
00:17:26,556 --> 00:17:28,193
<i>Twenty-one year old Frankie...</i>

220
00:17:29,161 --> 00:17:31,769
<i>He's married, he's got a wife and kid...</i>

221
00:17:49,043 --> 00:17:50,408
<i>Everybody is...</i>

222
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:53,811
<i>...acting so deranged.</i>

223
00:18:05,736 --> 00:18:07,292
Where is this party, anyway?

224
00:20:04,509 --> 00:20:05,794
My God...we've landed!

225
00:20:05,794 --> 00:20:06,756
Tim!

226
00:20:06,756 --> 00:20:08,361
It's better than taking acid!

227
00:20:09,311 --> 00:20:11,394
Righto, kids...open the door!

228
00:20:19,659 --> 00:20:21,945
Bloody fuckin' bastards!

229
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,489
Come on!

230
00:20:40,603 --> 00:20:41,959
God, I hate parties...

231
00:20:41,959 --> 00:20:43,796
Piece o' poo!

232
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:46,557
We've just been involved
in a serious accident.

233
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:48,904
Nearly cost us all out lives.

234
00:20:48,904 --> 00:20:51,404
Get me a drink, Billy...
I'm thirsty!

235
00:20:56,175 --> 00:20:57,584
Hey, Jeff...

236
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,358
Jeff!...

237
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:02,205
Say...'clitoris'!

238
00:21:02,777 --> 00:21:03,441
What?!

239
00:21:03,441 --> 00:21:05,292
Say 'clitoris'!

240
00:21:06,526 --> 00:21:08,062
Go on! It's easy!

241
00:21:08,062 --> 00:21:11,028
'Clit...or...is'!

242
00:21:16,782 --> 00:21:21,160
Anna!

243
00:21:22,108 --> 00:21:24,445
Hell!...Anna...Got a cigarette?

244
00:21:24,445 --> 00:21:26,734
Am I gonna get a drink?

245
00:21:26,734 --> 00:21:27,583
I want a beer!

246
00:21:41,011 --> 00:21:42,565
How does it feel?

247
00:21:42,565 --> 00:21:45,211
What?
How does 'what' feel?

248
00:21:45,211 --> 00:21:46,789
Being in love.

249
00:21:48,485 --> 00:21:49,629
THAT thing?!

250
00:21:51,218 --> 00:21:52,842
Really frightening.

251
00:22:07,832 --> 00:22:09,073
What have you got there, Sammy?

252
00:22:09,073 --> 00:22:10,663
My corelian wig.

253
00:22:18,487 --> 00:22:19,677
Yum!

254
00:22:21,453 --> 00:22:22,846
Get some crumpets.

255
00:22:23,902 --> 00:22:25,257
One 'Submarine' sandwich...

256
00:22:26,318 --> 00:22:27,817
...and a chocolate 'Paddle Pop'...

257
00:22:34,452 --> 00:22:36,224
Sammy...what else have you got?

258
00:22:37,495 --> 00:22:38,448
Do you want anything else?

259
00:22:38,448 --> 00:22:40,351
Oh, and a big brown of these.

260
00:22:40,351 --> 00:22:41,919
And a chocolate 'Smokey'...

261
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:42,917
We want these.

262
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:44,802
Thanks, Anna.

263
00:22:45,135 --> 00:22:45,956
That's alright.

264
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:47,806
Look at all the crumpets!

265
00:22:47,806 --> 00:22:49,174
Oh...what is this here?

266
00:22:50,667 --> 00:22:51,579
Remember these...

267
00:22:55,195 --> 00:22:56,727
A Winfield Blue...
and a packet of Peter Stuyvesant.

268
00:22:56,727 --> 00:22:57,936
And I'm Freddie!

269
00:22:58,553 --> 00:23:01,587
And 6 chocolate 'Freddos'...
Do you want anything?

270
00:23:04,089 --> 00:23:04,920
How much is that?

271
00:23:06,027 --> 00:23:06,663
Yum!

272
00:23:06,663 --> 00:23:07,471
Hot brick!

273
00:23:12,672 --> 00:23:14,964
I got dropped from the agency, today.

274
00:23:14,964 --> 00:23:15,817
What agency?

275
00:23:15,817 --> 00:23:18,212
The agency I work for!

276
00:23:20,763 --> 00:23:23,047
No more of this...
No more peanut butter!

277
00:23:23,414 --> 00:23:25,264
No more chocolate 'Smarties'.

278
00:23:25,264 --> 00:23:29,226
Oh, Anna...this Communion dress
is just beautiful!

279
00:23:29,968 --> 00:23:32,901
I had one just like that,
when I was at 'Holy Family'.

280
00:23:32,901 --> 00:23:34,970
'Holy Family'?!...
I was at 'Holy Family'.

281
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:37,347
Oh, bullshit, Sammy!...
You were not!

282
00:23:37,347 --> 00:23:38,159
I was!

283
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,855
Okay, then...
What's your Confirmation Name?

284
00:23:39,855 --> 00:23:40,577
There's Anna...

285
00:23:42,564 --> 00:23:43,492
...lookin' stoned.

286
00:23:43,492 --> 00:23:44,565
We ARE NOT!

287
00:23:44,565 --> 00:23:46,034
We haven't even GOT one!

288
00:23:46,034 --> 00:23:47,497
Oh...watch out!

289
00:23:48,645 --> 00:23:50,648
Get your OWN cigarettes, Sammy!

290
00:23:50,648 --> 00:23:52,290
I always buy them...!

291
00:23:52,674 --> 00:23:54,520
This is very important!

292
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,781
Is it, really?!

293
00:23:58,922 --> 00:24:02,129
<i>...the astronauts in the very special Skylab......</i>

294
00:24:08,593 --> 00:24:11,356
<i>...join concerns of people everywhere.</i>

295
00:24:12,162 --> 00:24:17,243
<i>...and the Skylab III crew...
we wish to extend to people around the world...</i>

296
00:24:17,243 --> 00:24:21,833
<i>..a message of peace, goodwill,
and human understanding.</i>

297
00:24:23,689 --> 00:24:25,215
I can't believe it!

298
00:24:26,251 --> 00:24:27,381
Fuckin' thing!

299
00:24:40,996 --> 00:24:43,820
Oh...Luchio...
Hi...This is Anne...

300
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:46,912
- Luchio...Anne...
- Hi Luchio... - Hi...

301
00:25:21,663 --> 00:25:24,030
I don't wanna hear about her!

302
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:26,939
Wouldn't you?...
Even when she had an amazing body!

303
00:25:26,939 --> 00:25:28,980
I don't want to hear about it!

304
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:33,927
We must have made love,
about...7...8 times.

305
00:25:33,927 --> 00:25:35,684
I don't want to hear about it!

306
00:25:35,684 --> 00:25:38,305
Luchio...there are millions
of girls out there...

307
00:25:38,305 --> 00:25:40,139
...All you have to do is
go out there and get them!

308
00:25:40,139 --> 00:25:41,240
Listen, arsehole!...

309
00:25:42,115 --> 00:25:45,352
I've got 6 engineering exams
to study for, in 5 weeks...

310
00:25:45,352 --> 00:25:47,700
...and I don't want YOU
fuckin' me around!

311
00:25:49,125 --> 00:25:50,922
Rompicolioni!

312
00:25:52,892 --> 00:25:53,943
Dingo!

313
00:26:09,704 --> 00:26:11,514
What are you doing?!...
We were watching that!

314
00:26:11,514 --> 00:26:12,531
You were asleep!

315
00:26:12,531 --> 00:26:14,285
Doesn't mean we weren't watching it.

316
00:26:16,329 --> 00:26:17,806
Can you believe that, Tim?

317
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:21,235
Leave him alone...
You're sick!

318
00:26:21,567 --> 00:26:23,286
My vein hurts.

319
00:26:27,561 --> 00:26:28,686
Timmy...

320
00:26:32,974 --> 00:26:34,917
Oh...shit!

321
00:26:42,758 --> 00:26:43,768
The door!

322
00:26:47,007 --> 00:26:48,906
Tim...get the door!

323
00:26:48,906 --> 00:26:49,914
Has to be Chuck!

324
00:26:49,914 --> 00:26:52,469
Oh, no...not Chuck!

325
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:55,944
- Chuck...Chuckie...
- Chuck you old bastard!

326
00:27:00,772 --> 00:27:02,613
Okay, shithead...
once is enough!

327
00:27:04,482 --> 00:27:05,578
My God...did I say that?!

328
00:27:05,945 --> 00:27:06,914
Luchio here?

329
00:27:06,914 --> 00:27:08,327
Luchio...um...

330
00:27:08,895 --> 00:27:10,073
The name rings a bell.

331
00:27:10,073 --> 00:27:11,165
Well, is he or isn't he?

332
00:27:13,185 --> 00:27:14,667
Luchio!

333
00:27:14,667 --> 00:27:16,107
Is this him, Leanne?

334
00:27:16,107 --> 00:27:17,742
Hang on...
Give me a look...

335
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:21,228
Luchio!

336
00:27:25,764 --> 00:27:26,870
We're in for some fun now.

337
00:27:33,686 --> 00:27:35,694
Hey...do you want us to go in there
and rough him up a bit?

338
00:27:35,694 --> 00:27:37,531
No...no worries...
I'll see you later.

339
00:27:45,912 --> 00:27:47,399
Jesus!...What a dump!

340
00:27:48,908 --> 00:27:50,427
Pleased to see me?

341
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:55,256
See ya, Leanne!...
See ya!

342
00:27:57,813 --> 00:27:59,523
Oh!...Fuck!

343
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:05,006
You nearly spitted on me...
...fucking arsehole!

344
00:28:07,287 --> 00:28:09,297
Oh...honey...

345
00:28:12,387 --> 00:28:13,154
Come back!

346
00:28:13,524 --> 00:28:15,270
- Fuck off!
- Don't leave me!

347
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,538
Get the bloody phone!

348
00:28:16,538 --> 00:28:18,187
I AM getting it!

349
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:23,880
I don't think so...
I'll just ask.

350
00:28:24,543 --> 00:28:25,410
Come back!

351
00:28:26,798 --> 00:28:28,747
Hello...she was here a few times
earlier in the week...

352
00:28:28,747 --> 00:28:30,789
...but she went off
on a school camp.

353
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:33,055
She's not there?

354
00:28:34,034 --> 00:28:35,879
Well, I don't know
where she'd be, then.

355
00:28:37,362 --> 00:28:40,312
No....I'm sure she's quite capable
of looking after herself.

356
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,120
Yep, she's a big girl, now!

357
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,496
- Yep...OK....bye bye.
- All she does is talk.

358
00:28:45,496 --> 00:28:47,749
Phone!...Shut up!

359
00:28:53,572 --> 00:28:54,968
She was crying.

360
00:28:54,969 --> 00:28:57,543
I don't need YOU or my mother 
to tell me what to do.

361
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:10,799
<i>Love 'll get you like a case of anthrax...</i>

362
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,714
<i>And that's something I don't want to catch</i>

363
00:29:14,551 --> 00:29:17,191
<i>Love 'll get you like a case of anthrax...</i>

364
00:29:17,191 --> 00:29:20,144
<i>And that's something I don't want to catch...</i>

365
00:29:28,458 --> 00:29:29,923
What's with the 'dress-up'?

366
00:29:31,887 --> 00:29:36,305
I have an interview
to become an air-hostess.

367
00:29:37,576 --> 00:29:38,568
Air-hostess!

368
00:29:39,875 --> 00:29:40,837
Airline food!

369
00:29:40,837 --> 00:29:42,819
Love airline food...
Bring me back some!

370
00:29:42,819 --> 00:29:45,106
Is that all you can
ever think about?

371
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,318
I think of lots of things...

372
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:49,115
Yeah? Like what?!

373
00:29:49,115 --> 00:29:51,590
Like...um...

374
00:29:57,467 --> 00:29:58,608
I'll use the axe!

375
00:29:58,608 --> 00:30:00,237
Now I've got to go
to the interview..all wet!...

376
00:30:00,237 --> 00:30:01,393
THANKS a lot!

377
00:30:01,393 --> 00:30:02,202
I'm sorry.

378
00:30:08,602 --> 00:30:10,551
What are you wearing THEM for?

379
00:30:12,588 --> 00:30:14,341
How else am I supposed to wash 'em?

380
00:30:16,796 --> 00:30:17,970
You're disgusting!

381
00:30:22,938 --> 00:30:23,941
Coming tonight?

382
00:30:23,941 --> 00:30:25,979
No!...
Who wants to hear YOU sing?

383
00:30:26,788 --> 00:30:28,038
Bring your eye-liner!
Please.

384
00:30:30,987 --> 00:30:32,718
Come on...let's DO something!

385
00:30:35,437 --> 00:30:36,821
Where did Mitch get to?

386
00:30:36,821 --> 00:30:39,940
Hang around, and you'll see
Mitch's first one-night stand!

387
00:30:41,571 --> 00:30:43,213
Let's score!

388
00:30:43,213 --> 00:30:44,486
I love that theme.

389
00:30:44,486 --> 00:30:47,613
Great pad, Anna...
How much is the rent?

390
00:30:48,214 --> 00:30:49,975
50 a week...great isn't it?

391
00:30:52,413 --> 00:30:54,108
This hair looks great...
You'll love it.

392
00:30:55,926 --> 00:30:57,518
Watch out...Chuck's here.

393
00:30:57,983 --> 00:30:59,948
Come on David...
Let's get a fuckin' move on!

394
00:30:59,949 --> 00:31:01,838
He's in a bad mood!

395
00:31:04,727 --> 00:31:06,005
We're busy...we're takin' stock!

396
00:31:06,005 --> 00:31:07,498
Better get that thing working, Tim.

397
00:31:08,024 --> 00:31:10,382
- Yeah...try it. Try it!
- Shut up!

398
00:31:10,382 --> 00:31:12,195
What about ME,
you bastards.

399
00:31:13,339 --> 00:31:15,237
How are the synthesisers, Timmy?

400
00:31:16,567 --> 00:31:18,060
It's gonna be fantastic.

401
00:31:24,425 --> 00:31:25,999
Can I have a bottle of ephedrine.

402
00:31:32,062 --> 00:31:32,972
Yes...it's all there...

403
00:31:36,162 --> 00:31:38,045
- You get 'em?
- Yeah.

404
00:31:42,272 --> 00:31:44,232
Chuck's leaving...
Come on!

405
00:31:46,922 --> 00:31:48,026
It's wonderful!

406
00:31:48,026 --> 00:31:50,499
Looks great...
Just love it!

407
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:55,354
- You're a fantastic hairdresser, Anna.
- Come back here!

408
00:31:56,357 --> 00:31:58,944
Leanne...come on up!

409
00:32:01,349 --> 00:32:02,085
Boo!

410
00:32:02,085 --> 00:32:04,673
'Called Sue'...
I'll be right down.

411
00:32:05,477 --> 00:32:07,084
Bloody hippy!

412
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:14,691
- Hi Sue....sorry!
- Bloody sex-maniac!

413
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:17,387
Fixed it, Tim?

414
00:32:17,387 --> 00:32:18,989
- Shut up, Chuck!
- Hi, Tim.

415
00:32:19,908 --> 00:32:22,547
- This is Sue.
- Hi Sue!  - Hi!

416
00:32:22,547 --> 00:32:24,962
Tim...can I borrow
your Dingo record?

417
00:32:26,351 --> 00:32:27,316
Can you borrow it?!

418
00:32:27,316 --> 00:32:29,092
You've still got it
from last time!

419
00:32:29,092 --> 00:32:30,870
-You're right, Tim...
- I've given up trying to steal it back!

420
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:32,541
What 've you done with my sticks?

421
00:32:38,613 --> 00:32:39,746
Great!

422
00:32:41,996 --> 00:32:43,383
Nice!

423
00:32:46,308 --> 00:32:47,318
That should do it!

424
00:32:50,333 --> 00:32:53,144
Prepare yourself, Moocho...
He's playin' that record again.

425
00:32:58,124 --> 00:32:58,124
Sam...where are my sticks?

426
00:32:59,238 --> 00:33:00,873
Thanks for nothin',
you bastard!

427
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:33,282
Alright...let's drive!

428
00:33:35,645 --> 00:33:37,730
<i>...true love...working it out...</i>

429
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:40,192
<i>True love's what it's all about...</i>

430
00:33:40,192 --> 00:33:43,380
<i>True love...beautiful...</i>

431
00:33:46,172 --> 00:33:47,036
Hey!...

432
00:33:47,758 --> 00:33:49,514
What's on at the monkey's place?

433
00:33:52,445 --> 00:33:53,541
Hey...Anna!...

434
00:33:58,558 --> 00:33:59,839
Got any underwear, Anna?

435
00:33:59,903 --> 00:34:01,225
Have you got my lipstick?

436
00:34:03,949 --> 00:34:04,674
Who's playing, Anna?

437
00:34:04,674 --> 00:34:06,181
The Champions!

438
00:34:08,908 --> 00:34:11,109
Somebody get the fucking phone!

439
00:34:50,031 --> 00:34:51,563
Just leave me alone.

440
00:34:51,563 --> 00:34:53,064
Yeah...you'd like that,
wouldn't ya?!

441
00:34:53,064 --> 00:34:55,093
I hate ya...hate, hate, hate!

442
00:34:56,769 --> 00:34:59,047
Fuck that...
I've got pure adrenalin!

443
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,546
Cigarette?

444
00:35:24,982 --> 00:35:26,008
Still guilts?

445
00:35:28,227 --> 00:35:29,906
It's about Tim...

446
00:35:31,342 --> 00:35:33,356
I've got this friend...
with a real synthesiser.

447
00:35:33,356 --> 00:35:34,970
Well, Chuck...
Time to buy us a beer.

448
00:35:35,614 --> 00:35:37,242
Reckon it might be,
you old bastard.

449
00:35:37,242 --> 00:35:38,815
Come down to the bar with me,
and I'll buy YOU one.

450
00:35:39,823 --> 00:35:41,681
This stuff's made
from an electronics kit!

451
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:44,127
You could get something 
so much better.

452
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,750
He's not a fuckin' muso...
He can't even play.

453
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:54,218
It'd be really good to have someone... 
who knows something about music.

454
00:35:58,534 --> 00:36:03,898
<i>I've been contemplating suicide...</i>

455
00:36:03,898 --> 00:36:11,468
<i>But it really doesn't suit my style...</i>

456
00:36:14,313 --> 00:36:19,667
<i>So I think I'll just act bored instead...</i>

457
00:36:21,648 --> 00:36:27,002
<i>Who contain the blood I could've shed?</i>

458
00:36:29,703 --> 00:36:35,739
<i>She makes me feel so weary...</i>

459
00:36:35,739 --> 00:36:42,617
<i>My heart is really on its knees...</i>

460
00:36:44,804 --> 00:36:49,509
<i>But I keep a poker face so well...</i>

461
00:36:53,696 --> 00:36:58,804
<i>That even mother couldn't tell...</i>

462
00:37:08,546 --> 00:37:09,782
Oh, fuck it!

463
00:37:11,082 --> 00:37:14,316
Come on girls...
give it a push!

464
00:37:14,317 --> 00:37:17,014
Come on girls...push, Anna!

465
00:37:26,725 --> 00:37:28,356
Why don't you, 'round the door?

466
00:37:28,356 --> 00:37:29,604
Come on...let's go...

467
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,729
Are you a cowgirl?!

468
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:56,660
Whoo...cowgirl!...whoo whoo!

469
00:37:57,493 --> 00:37:59,162
Fuckin' bitches!...
Fuck off!

470
00:38:03,124 --> 00:38:04,626
Oh...you're beautiful!

471
00:38:23,346 --> 00:38:24,782
Could you buy me a drink, Annie?

472
00:38:24,782 --> 00:38:27,125
You were going to give me some pot.

473
00:38:27,125 --> 00:38:28,150
Anna!

474
00:38:30,418 --> 00:38:32,067
Buy us a beer!

475
00:38:33,206 --> 00:38:34,331
I missed you!

476
00:38:34,331 --> 00:38:35,857
You know you only said that yourself!

477
00:38:35,857 --> 00:38:37,121
I do so love you!

478
00:38:37,121 --> 00:38:37,891
Liar!

479
00:38:37,891 --> 00:38:39,756
I do! I love your big nose!

480
00:38:39,756 --> 00:38:40,798
Big nose!

481
00:38:53,953 --> 00:38:55,040
Filthy cowgirl moll!

482
00:38:59,243 --> 00:39:00,638
It's not finished yet.

483
00:39:06,729 --> 00:39:08,064
Hi, Anna!

484
00:39:08,757 --> 00:39:10,523
- It's alright?
- Yeah.

485
00:39:11,427 --> 00:39:12,606
- Kate!
- Yeah?

486
00:39:12,606 --> 00:39:14,201
- Got any 'speed' on you?
- Yeah!

487
00:39:17,393 --> 00:39:18,721
What's the matter with HER?

488
00:39:26,857 --> 00:39:29,499
Alright, guys...what's happening?
What's that doing?

489
00:40:22,278 --> 00:40:23,486
Excuse me...

490
00:40:24,483 --> 00:40:26,146
Could I have a tequila and orange...

491
00:40:33,096 --> 00:40:34,525
Are you sure it's in here?

492
00:40:35,689 --> 00:40:37,230
There...it's in there!

493
00:40:41,845 --> 00:40:43,879
Thanks...That'll do.

494
00:41:01,493 --> 00:41:04,179
Pure adrenalin...
George got it from a chemist place.

495
00:41:10,723 --> 00:41:12,255
Oh...shit!

496
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:15,928
Oh my God...

497
00:41:39,557 --> 00:41:42,503
I don't think you should
swallow this in future.

498
00:41:42,503 --> 00:41:43,847
Yeah.

499
00:41:44,459 --> 00:41:46,927
Can't you get that
bloody thing working, Tim?

500
00:41:46,927 --> 00:41:48,609
Leave him alone, Davis!

501
00:41:48,609 --> 00:41:51,103
It's supposed to be a synthesiser,
you know.

502
00:41:51,103 --> 00:41:52,722
Shut up, will you...
It's gonna work.

503
00:41:53,514 --> 00:41:55,417
Come on, Tim...
Get it together!

504
00:42:04,783 --> 00:42:07,676
Hello there...dogs in space.

505
00:42:19,182 --> 00:42:23,381
<i>Long ago when I was not much younger
than a day...</i>

506
00:42:24,213 --> 00:42:29,060
<i>Daddy used to take me there
to watch him as he played...</i>

507
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:33,658
<i>Golf course do you remember
of course you do...</i>

508
00:42:34,853 --> 00:42:38,794
<i>Golf course when I was young
I did not envy you...</i>

509
00:42:44,982 --> 00:42:49,270
<i>Now the days have turned to years
and I'll become a man...</i>

510
00:42:49,784 --> 00:42:54,681
<i>I bought myself a set of clubs
and I tried the best I can.</i>

511
00:43:00,307 --> 00:43:04,793
<i>Here comes the early morning light
revealing you...</i>

512
00:43:04,793 --> 00:43:09,983
<i>Golf course without you there's
not much a man can do...</i>

513
00:43:30,997 --> 00:43:35,288
<i>Golf course do you remember?...
Of course you do...</i>

514
00:43:36,399 --> 00:43:40,325
<i>Golf course when I was young
I did not envy you...</i>

515
00:43:51,661 --> 00:43:56,206
<i>A world's a scene in my head
telling me how to play...</i>

516
00:43:57,072 --> 00:44:02,948
<i>I'm alive, so alive, well,
what more can I say?</i>

517
00:44:12,167 --> 00:44:17,099
<i>Ask me what I get it done
than where the future lies...</i>

518
00:44:17,099 --> 00:44:22,045
<i>I tap my clubs and smile and say
I'll stay here 'til I die.</i>

519
00:44:22,765 --> 00:44:27,092
<i>Here comes the early morning light
revealing you...</i>

520
00:44:27,736 --> 00:44:31,912
<i>Golf course when I was young remember,
I did not envy you.</i>

521
00:44:32,761 --> 00:44:36,930
<i>Golf course do you remember?
Of course you do!</i>

522
00:44:37,958 --> 00:44:42,172
<i>Golf course a hundred percent....
I'll not envy you...</i>

523
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:55,444
I can fix it...
Just give us a second.

524
00:44:56,974 --> 00:44:59,220
Okay...here's your beers...
Let's get out of here...right?

525
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:00,732
Boz...I'll buy you a drink.

526
00:45:00,732 --> 00:45:02,051
Big fucking deal!

527
00:45:02,051 --> 00:45:03,263
Do you forgive me?

528
00:45:03,263 --> 00:45:03,645
Sam!...

529
00:45:09,403 --> 00:45:11,216
Listen...can you score for us?

530
00:45:11,216 --> 00:45:12,294
Can you sing?!

531
00:45:13,046 --> 00:45:14,139
Thank you very much.

532
00:45:18,056 --> 00:45:24,190
<i>I've been contemplating suicide...</i>

533
00:45:26,710 --> 00:45:33,290
<i>but it really doesn't suit my style...</i>

534
00:45:35,336 --> 00:45:41,209
<i>so I think I'll just act bored instead...</i>

535
00:45:41,641 --> 00:45:43,407
Fakes and phonies...

536
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,660
That's all they fucking-well are!

537
00:45:47,797 --> 00:45:49,777
How do you know
if you've had a good time?

538
00:45:51,768 --> 00:45:53,032
Well, how d'ya know?

539
00:45:53,032 --> 00:45:54,673
How DO ya know?!

540
00:45:55,296 --> 00:45:57,889
When ya throw ya knickers
up against the wall...

541
00:45:57,889 --> 00:46:00,068
...and they STICK there!

542
00:46:04,196 --> 00:46:06,915
You wanted to front that girl...
didn't ya?!

543
00:46:08,041 --> 00:46:09,323
Tim...

544
00:46:10,419 --> 00:46:12,567
We've all decided
to get a new keyboard...

545
00:46:12,567 --> 00:46:14,150
...kind of.

546
00:46:15,575 --> 00:46:16,964
It doesn't matter.

547
00:46:16,964 --> 00:46:18,523
I was gonna leave, anyway.

548
00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:27,929
Are you coming, Sammy... or what?

549
00:46:28,721 --> 00:46:30,729
Hey...wait for ME!

550
00:46:34,029 --> 00:46:37,803
<i>and the sound of her name</i>

551
00:46:37,803 --> 00:46:43,029
<i>sends a permanent shiver 
down my SPINE.</i>

552
00:47:00,418 --> 00:47:05,736
<i>I keep her photograph against my heart...</i>

553
00:47:08,753 --> 00:47:14,490
<i>for in my life she played a starring part.</i>

554
00:47:16,433 --> 00:47:22,904
<i>All alcohol and cigarettes...</i>

555
00:47:25,094 --> 00:47:31,081
<i>I've got no room for cheap regrets...</i>

556
00:47:32,869 --> 00:47:34,517
Will you do it for me?

557
00:47:50,523 --> 00:47:51,874
Just hold onto it.

558
00:47:56,804 --> 00:47:58,884
You will have a long flight...

559
00:47:58,884 --> 00:47:59,982
And then you should come clean.

560
00:49:03,553 --> 00:49:06,802
Once upon a time,
there was a green monster...

561
00:49:07,293 --> 00:49:11,472
And he ate a whole train
full of obnoxious people.

562
00:49:12,770 --> 00:49:15,354
Of course he got
a very bad case of indigestion...

563
00:49:15,959 --> 00:49:17,519
...that lasted for many weeks.

564
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:21,033
And so he eventually decided
that he needed some medicine.

565
00:49:21,808 --> 00:49:25,376
He strolled, on his many legs,
to the nearest pharmacist, and said...

566
00:49:25,376 --> 00:49:28,593
"I have indigestion and nausea..."

567
00:49:29,153 --> 00:49:30,789
"What from?" asked the chemist.

568
00:49:30,789 --> 00:49:34,146
"Oh...just all the obnoxious people
in this world."

569
00:49:35,169 --> 00:49:36,645
...said the dragon.

570
00:49:36,645 --> 00:49:40,225
And the chemist, after carefully
considering the monster's problem...

571
00:49:40,225 --> 00:49:42,733
...gave him some milk of magnesia.

572
00:49:43,798 --> 00:49:46,812
In 2 days, the monster
was feeling better again...

573
00:49:46,812 --> 00:49:49,801
So he ate another train
full of the same sort of people.

574
00:49:52,649 --> 00:49:54,624
He felt worse than before...

575
00:49:54,624 --> 00:49:56,162
...and after weeks of suffering...

576
00:49:56,162 --> 00:49:57,993
...went back to the chemist...

577
00:49:57,993 --> 00:50:00,506
"Please help me, Mr Chemist!"
he said

578
00:50:00,506 --> 00:50:04,205
"All of THOSE people in this world,
make me terribly sick."

579
00:50:04,205 --> 00:50:06,472
The pharmacist replied...

580
00:50:06,472 --> 00:50:10,014
"You must get over this terrible objection
to the people of this world..."

581
00:50:10,014 --> 00:50:12,997
"I'll give you some
milk of magnesia, anyway."

582
00:50:13,711 --> 00:50:17,037
The green monster
was much fatter now...

583
00:50:17,037 --> 00:50:21,674
...yet, as he had eaten 2 trains...
recovered in a few days.

584
00:50:22,386 --> 00:50:24,292
He was lying
by the railway tracks...

585
00:50:24,292 --> 00:50:26,644
...when a train stopped,
right in front of him.

586
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:29,696
He looked up with his big brown eyes...

587
00:50:29,696 --> 00:50:31,535
...watching the people...

588
00:51:04,422 --> 00:51:08,002
<i>Even man's sleep was monitored
by a cap with sensors...</i>

589
00:51:08,002 --> 00:51:12,213
<i>...as each astronaut bedded down
vertically in a sort of sleeping bag...</i>

590
00:51:12,213 --> 00:51:13,923
<i>...in his individual sleep compartment...</i>

591
00:51:13,923 --> 00:51:16,662
<i>...or should I say...stateroom!</i>

592
00:51:23,251 --> 00:51:25,554
Why on the one-way?...
Look at notice...

593
00:51:25,554 --> 00:51:27,383
Look at the sign,
you bastard...look!

594
00:51:29,837 --> 00:51:32,045
Only one-way...
Only one-way! You...

595
00:51:35,493 --> 00:51:37,051
You want a go, mate?...
Come on!...

596
00:51:38,334 --> 00:51:39,916
Effin' wog!

597
00:51:48,584 --> 00:51:49,546
Morning!

598
00:51:53,909 --> 00:51:55,217
Leanne!

599
00:51:55,217 --> 00:51:56,087
It depends, really...

600
00:51:56,087 --> 00:51:58,739
It can be over in 5 minutes.

601
00:51:59,804 --> 00:52:01,811
And then...it can last for hours.

602
00:52:01,811 --> 00:52:03,616
Especially if it's stirred.

603
00:52:03,616 --> 00:52:05,584
And sometimes
you can almost fall asleep.

604
00:52:06,452 --> 00:52:08,883
The worst part of it
is standing up after...

605
00:52:08,883 --> 00:52:10,924
...and have it all running
down your leg!

606
00:52:12,211 --> 00:52:13,699
Yeah...yuk!

607
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:32,498
Get up!

608
00:52:38,065 --> 00:52:39,376
What sort of time do you call this?

609
00:52:39,376 --> 00:52:40,487
We've been up since 5 o'clock!

610
00:52:40,487 --> 00:52:41,713
- Hi, Al!
- Come on!

611
00:52:41,713 --> 00:52:43,085
Jesus Christ!...

612
00:52:43,085 --> 00:52:46,692
-...What sort of dump...
- Tony...wake up! You've got some visitors.

613
00:52:46,692 --> 00:52:49,602
What sort of shit-cunt
sort of street is this anyway?!

614
00:52:49,602 --> 00:52:51,536
Lucky I didn't bring the '250' down here...

615
00:52:51,828 --> 00:52:53,142
I've brought the 'F100'...

616
00:52:53,142 --> 00:52:54,661
It was all I could do
to get it down the street.

617
00:52:54,661 --> 00:52:56,733
- It wouldn't do me, I tell ya.
- Come on...wake up!

618
00:53:21,190 --> 00:53:23,119
I've got a truckload
of chainsaws down there...

619
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:24,623
I'd better not leave them there
without me being there.

620
00:53:30,357 --> 00:53:31,815
I'll go down and get 'em
out of the truck.

621
00:53:31,815 --> 00:53:33,274
I'll bring them into the kitchen.

622
00:53:35,094 --> 00:53:36,011
Okay?

623
00:53:41,042 --> 00:53:42,721
Weren't you supposed
to be at work today?

624
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:44,384
I don't feel like going.

625
00:53:46,418 --> 00:53:48,198
Well, how would YOU
like to try it?

626
00:53:48,198 --> 00:53:51,429
You just don't give a shit about anyone
except yourself...DO you?

627
00:53:55,168 --> 00:53:58,915
<i>Let's go back to the comfortable environment
of life in space.</i>

628
00:54:06,846 --> 00:54:10,287
<i>No circus acrobat
or elite swimmer, can match this. </i>

629
00:54:19,019 --> 00:54:20,690
Well, you take this little beauty, mate...

630
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:22,424
It purrs like a kitten full of cream...

631
00:54:24,014 --> 00:54:26,448
It's so simple to use...
your granny could use it...

632
00:54:26,448 --> 00:54:27,771
And this chain brake...

633
00:54:27,771 --> 00:54:30,937
That's what your professionals
dream of...right?

634
00:54:30,937 --> 00:54:34,605
I tell you what...
It's got an 80cc motor...

635
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:36,764
...that puts out enough power...

636
00:54:36,764 --> 00:54:40,169
...to really get
you environmentalists worried!

637
00:54:45,517 --> 00:54:46,287
Sam!

638
00:54:46,287 --> 00:54:49,940
Down there to the left...
just right in front of the telly.

639
00:54:55,195 --> 00:54:58,264
Oh God...a hippy!...
...Yeah?

640
00:54:59,177 --> 00:55:01,439
I'm Barbara...I rang you.

641
00:55:02,397 --> 00:55:04,120
I'm from the Socialist Youth Alliance.

642
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:04,961
Oh, yeah!

643
00:55:04,961 --> 00:55:07,225
Yeah...
The 'Rock Against Unemployment' concert.

644
00:55:07,225 --> 00:55:07,982
Have a seat.

645
00:55:15,059 --> 00:55:16,436
Where shall I start?

646
00:55:16,747 --> 00:55:19,221
Well, that's Nick...he's in the band...
plays guitar...

647
00:55:20,592 --> 00:55:21,557
Hi Nick!

648
00:55:23,054 --> 00:55:24,032
Excellent!

649
00:55:24,032 --> 00:55:27,091
- Hey Nick...which one's Don Bradman?
- Well as you're probably already aware...

650
00:55:27,091 --> 00:55:30,471
...all the welfare schemes
put into operation by the sacked Labor government...

651
00:55:30,471 --> 00:55:34,692
...have been ruthlessly slashed
by the present fascist Fraser dictatorship.

652
00:55:34,692 --> 00:55:37,203
It eats into the living tissue
of the working classes...

653
00:55:37,203 --> 00:55:38,554
...like a tumour.

654
00:55:38,554 --> 00:55:39,910
"Power to the workers"...yeah...

655
00:55:39,910 --> 00:55:40,912
I've got cancer.

656
00:55:42,581 --> 00:55:45,676
It's a refusal to even acknowledge
the institutionalised bureaucracy...

657
00:55:45,676 --> 00:55:48,270
...that perpetrates these social conditions...
...Right?!

658
00:55:48,270 --> 00:55:51,865
So...we're organising a benefit concert...

659
00:55:51,865 --> 00:55:54,017
...for bands such as yourselves...

660
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:57,357
...whose music epitomises an anarchist
and...

661
00:55:57,357 --> 00:55:58,676
Anarchistic?

662
00:55:59,902 --> 00:56:00,685
Anarchistic...

663
00:56:00,685 --> 00:56:01,795
Got a cigarette?

664
00:56:01,795 --> 00:56:05,282
...reaction to the present
totalitarian society...

665
00:56:05,282 --> 00:56:09,749
..and attempts to break down
the crushing monopolies of the multinationals.

666
00:56:09,749 --> 00:56:11,654
No future...right?!

667
00:56:11,654 --> 00:56:14,887
Right.
How much money we gonna get?

668
00:56:14,887 --> 00:56:16,184
How much money do we get?

669
00:56:19,684 --> 00:56:21,366
Has your band got insurance?

670
00:56:22,661 --> 00:56:23,907
"Countdown"!

671
00:56:23,907 --> 00:56:25,707
<i>And now...live through Australia...</i>

672
00:56:25,707 --> 00:56:27,105
<i>"Countdown"...</i>

673
00:56:36,932 --> 00:56:38,837
<i>Now let's talk to the great Bowie!</i>

674
00:56:38,837 --> 00:56:40,619
Get out of the way!

675
00:56:41,788 --> 00:56:44,177
Hi...I'm Barbara.

676
00:56:44,177 --> 00:56:49,190
G'day...I'm Jenny... this is Colin...Al...
Emmy and Lizzy.

677
00:56:52,444 --> 00:56:56,931
Do you people realise the present capitalist crisis,
we now find ourselves in?

678
00:56:57,632 --> 00:57:00,493
I mean...we're in a situation today...

679
00:57:00,493 --> 00:57:02,230
...totally and completely...

680
00:57:02,308 --> 00:57:05,832
This'll go through a red-gum sleeper,
like a knife through a piece of fuckin' butter.

681
00:57:05,832 --> 00:57:06,986
Do you realise that?

682
00:57:06,986 --> 00:57:09,473
If this gets stuck...say in a log...

683
00:57:09,473 --> 00:57:12,529
All you do, is whack on the chain brake...

684
00:57:12,529 --> 00:57:14,592
And it slips straight out, like that!

685
00:57:14,592 --> 00:57:16,041
Fuckin' incredible!

686
00:57:16,041 --> 00:57:17,222
Where's Eno?

687
00:57:17,222 --> 00:57:18,678
Did he get thrown out
of his band, too?

688
00:57:18,678 --> 00:57:19,764
Shut up, Tim!

689
00:57:19,764 --> 00:57:21,185
I'll give you a demonstration...

690
00:57:36,847 --> 00:57:37,946
Now we missed it all!

691
00:57:40,003 --> 00:57:41,302
Fuckin' idiot!

692
00:57:41,302 --> 00:57:45,103
That's a dumb thing...
We're trying to listen to the TV.

693
00:57:45,103 --> 00:57:46,564
We were watching that.

694
00:57:48,811 --> 00:57:51,289
You wouldn't 've said that
if it was a guitar, you know.

695
00:57:53,183 --> 00:57:54,080
YOU could operate that.

696
00:57:55,295 --> 00:57:57,327
Look...it's like driving a car...

697
00:57:57,327 --> 00:57:59,694
I drive a V8...
I wouldn't drive anything else.

698
00:57:59,694 --> 00:58:01,621
Not like these whelps in here...

699
00:58:02,865 --> 00:58:04,689
They're putting
the whole movement back years.

700
00:58:06,523 --> 00:58:10,867
After 1975 and 'Gang of Four'...

701
00:58:10,867 --> 00:58:12,183
Hiya 'Chainsaw Baby'!

702
00:58:15,662 --> 00:58:18,148
How'dya like a nice big axe
to play with, eh?

703
00:58:19,410 --> 00:58:21,812
It was originally designed
by the Swedish...

704
00:58:23,661 --> 00:58:26,827
...to operate under
all weather conditions.

705
00:58:27,747 --> 00:58:30,023
Here's our bundle...
Haven't paid in 3 months...

706
00:58:30,650 --> 00:58:31,410
There's Guy Fawkes.

707
00:58:31,410 --> 00:58:33,709
Won't be long before you're
spewing out one of them, will it?

708
00:58:36,874 --> 00:58:38,714
I hate babies!

709
00:58:38,714 --> 00:58:40,736
One day you can grow up
and take on louts like him...

710
00:58:40,736 --> 00:58:42,008
Won't that be fun?!

711
00:58:42,009 --> 00:58:44,493
Let's say hello to Uncle Sammy No-brain!

712
00:58:49,250 --> 00:58:52,195
It's the only part of the whole machine
that's not made in Sweden.

713
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:53,654
But you've got to remember...

714
00:58:53,654 --> 00:58:56,871
Put the plastic cover
back on the top.

715
00:58:56,871 --> 00:59:00,077
Otherwise you could
put your hand back...

716
00:59:00,077 --> 00:59:01,946
...and burn the back of it
on the cylinder-head.

717
00:59:02,990 --> 00:59:07,609
Otherwise it's a...
fucking amazing machine, that!

718
00:59:08,258 --> 00:59:09,753
It's a fucking amazing machine.

719
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:34,135
Don't forget to get the batteries.

720
00:59:34,995 --> 00:59:37,574
Hello, welcome to the store...
How can WE help YOU?!

721
00:59:41,908 --> 00:59:43,987
There's better be some egg-flip here!

722
00:59:45,751 --> 00:59:47,028
There's only one left,
and that's mine!

723
00:59:48,533 --> 00:59:50,604
I'll tell Tim...but I don't think
he'll be very pleased.

724
00:59:54,461 --> 00:59:56,312
- Tim...no egg-flip left.
- What?!

725
00:59:58,546 --> 01:00:00,480
No bloody egg-flip left...man...
what's the world coming to!

726
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,625
I've been called a lot of things
in my time...

727
01:00:02,625 --> 01:00:04,326
....but I'm not responsible
for shortages.

728
01:00:04,326 --> 01:00:05,616
I like these...

729
01:00:05,616 --> 01:00:06,905
Can I get a whole-grain sandwich?

730
01:00:06,905 --> 01:00:08,269
Can I get some 'Coco-Pops'?

731
01:00:09,342 --> 01:00:11,261
Davis...you're really stupid!...

732
01:00:11,261 --> 01:00:14,193
Big...little...

733
01:00:18,170 --> 01:00:19,733
Well at least we're in bread.

734
01:00:48,570 --> 01:00:49,308
Hello, Mum.

735
01:00:51,695 --> 01:00:52,687
Hello, Sam!

736
01:00:54,002 --> 01:00:54,833
The time, Mum.

737
01:00:54,833 --> 01:00:56,407
I had to book it, Sam.

738
01:01:16,589 --> 01:01:17,679
No drinks?

739
01:01:17,679 --> 01:01:20,283
Sorry...I'll go and get something.

740
01:01:20,283 --> 01:01:21,879
No...don't bother.

741
01:01:27,383 --> 01:01:28,918
I brought you some clean clothes.

742
01:01:35,006 --> 01:01:36,493
Are you still with that girl?

743
01:01:38,387 --> 01:01:39,239
Does SHE cook?

744
01:01:42,526 --> 01:01:44,075
Father Francis said to say hello.

745
01:01:46,689 --> 01:01:48,686
You can ALWAYS stay at home,
you know.

746
01:01:48,686 --> 01:01:50,347
I'm on my own now.

747
01:02:11,763 --> 01:02:13,183
Luch...

748
01:02:14,757 --> 01:02:17,199
There's something
I've been meaning to tell you...

749
01:02:19,281 --> 01:02:20,850
I'm pregnant.

750
01:02:23,631 --> 01:02:25,513
Well, I know it's not yours...

751
01:02:26,197 --> 01:02:27,519
But it's gonna need a father...

752
01:02:47,939 --> 01:02:49,254
Enjoy that?

753
01:02:49,943 --> 01:02:51,256
I have to go now...

754
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:56,639
- Take care.
- I will.

755
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:01,850
See you, Mum.

756
01:03:04,502 --> 01:03:05,421
Bang!

757
01:03:05,422 --> 01:03:05,908
But, Leanne...

758
01:03:05,908 --> 01:03:06,893
Bloody arsehole!

759
01:03:06,893 --> 01:03:08,476
Leanne, I'm not the father!

760
01:03:08,476 --> 01:03:10,220
Thanks for nothin', creep-face!

761
01:03:10,946 --> 01:03:11,859
Aw...Leanne!

762
01:03:15,559 --> 01:03:17,564
- Hi, Leanne.
- Piss off!

763
01:03:48,927 --> 01:03:50,445
Anna...

764
01:03:53,333 --> 01:03:54,495
Anna...Is that you?

765
01:03:57,479 --> 01:03:58,427
Fucking arsehole!

766
01:03:58,427 --> 01:04:01,821
Why don't you go after her,
if that's what you want?!

767
01:05:02,568 --> 01:05:05,095
Hey Tim...this egg-flip
tastes like cold sick!

768
01:05:05,095 --> 01:05:05,816
Yeah...great, isn't it?

769
01:05:05,816 --> 01:05:07,395
Sammy No-brain!

770
01:05:11,756 --> 01:05:15,190
I wouldn't kiss you, if you were
the last bloke on earth!

771
01:05:15,190 --> 01:05:17,517
Oh yes...you don't have to,
you know.

772
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:21,852
Bloody egg-flips are shit!

773
01:05:24,308 --> 01:05:27,595
<i>- What day is it Mully?
- I'm not Mully...</i>

774
01:05:29,435 --> 01:05:31,451
Get out of the way...
You weed!

775
01:05:43,430 --> 01:05:47,355
What gives me the shits, is the Fraser
government's attitude to land rights.

776
01:05:47,390 --> 01:05:49,041
After what he did to Whitlam!

777
01:05:50,523 --> 01:05:53,031
One of my closest friends
has an aboriginal girlfriend, right...

778
01:05:53,031 --> 01:05:54,755
A really beautiful person...

779
01:05:55,575 --> 01:05:57,020
But so fucking angst!

780
01:05:57,653 --> 01:05:59,249
Are you a Malist or a Trot?

781
01:05:59,249 --> 01:06:00,845
Smile, guys!

782
01:06:03,438 --> 01:06:04,684
<i>...stop jumping up and down...</i>

783
01:06:04,684 --> 01:06:05,820
<i>...so I can see who you are.</i>

784
01:06:05,820 --> 01:06:07,876
<i>I'm not jumping.</i>

785
01:06:08,919 --> 01:06:09,862
<i>What's your name?</i>

786
01:06:09,862 --> 01:06:10,987
<i>Guthrie.</i>

787
01:06:10,987 --> 01:06:12,776
<i>Are you someone I know?</i>

788
01:06:12,776 --> 01:06:15,222
<i>We met last night
at the Waldorf-Ritz.</i>

789
01:06:15,222 --> 01:06:18,459
<i>Oh yes, you were with Mrs Matthews,
talking to God.</i>

790
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:20,915
<i>Or were you?</i>

791
01:06:20,915 --> 01:06:23,085
<i>I'm the forgotten man.</i>

792
01:06:23,998 --> 01:06:25,265
But surely you'd allow Maoists back.

793
01:06:25,265 --> 01:06:28,458
HOW much money did you...?

794
01:06:37,278 --> 01:06:40,625
It's arseholes like you
who perpetuate the state of male domination...

795
01:06:40,625 --> 01:06:42,984
How many other societies
do YOU know of...

796
01:06:42,984 --> 01:06:45,895
...where the main form of male abuse
is to grope for the female genitals.

797
01:06:45,895 --> 01:06:49,401
Women are the slaves of slaves...
and the outcasts of outcasts...

798
01:06:49,810 --> 01:06:51,441
...Bonded into marital prostitution...

799
01:06:51,441 --> 01:06:53,555
...in YOUR male-dominated society.

800
01:06:56,572 --> 01:06:58,154
Are we gettin' through to you,
shit-head?

801
01:06:58,442 --> 01:07:02,952
...you and your wife bloody fill us up
with toxins from our industrialised society...

802
01:07:03,409 --> 01:07:05,610
Now this is the only thing
that can break 'em down.

803
01:07:06,233 --> 01:07:08,083
I used to be in a band.

804
01:07:09,092 --> 01:07:10,125
I quit, though.

805
01:07:10,841 --> 01:07:12,437
I'm getting too famous.

806
01:07:12,437 --> 01:07:15,272
- Chlorophyl?
- Yeah...chlorophyl.

807
01:07:15,272 --> 01:07:16,653
Liquid sunshine!

808
01:07:16,653 --> 01:07:18,139
You look at any society
in the world today...

809
01:07:18,139 --> 01:07:20,758
...and on the bottom rung of the ladder,
you'll find women and blacks...

810
01:07:20,832 --> 01:07:22,655
Do you understand that...
you stupid cunt!?

811
01:07:22,655 --> 01:07:23,543
Cheers, Bub.

812
01:07:32,072 --> 01:07:33,861
Bloody punk-rockers!

813
01:07:41,370 --> 01:07:44,420
What the hell...
That's why I use benzie.

814
01:07:44,420 --> 01:07:46,438
Hey...it's the fuckin' Trots, mate...

815
01:07:46,438 --> 01:07:47,222
Split us!...

816
01:07:47,222 --> 01:07:48,529
Split the black movement...

817
01:07:48,529 --> 01:07:49,566
Split the women's movement...

818
01:07:49,566 --> 01:07:52,394
Split the primates!
Split the fuckin' apathy!

819
01:07:55,687 --> 01:07:57,246
Still smoking that?

820
01:08:00,462 --> 01:08:02,520
There's not much left...

821
01:08:03,258 --> 01:08:05,112
I can't believe you're living
in this place...

822
01:08:05,112 --> 01:08:09,186
These men are preying on the naivet
and inexperience of young girls!

823
01:08:09,186 --> 01:08:11,001
It's pure sexual exploitation!

824
01:08:12,265 --> 01:08:15,039
Barny, mate!...Merci beaucoup!...
as they say in fuckin' Europe.

825
01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:16,790
You have beautiful hair!

826
01:08:19,513 --> 01:08:21,384
Are you involved with anybody
at the moment?

827
01:08:24,188 --> 01:08:26,499
Get out of it...you stupid creep!

828
01:08:34,969 --> 01:08:36,954
What YOU need...is a good fuck!

829
01:08:39,977 --> 01:08:41,764
I had some 'magic mushrooms', once.

830
01:08:42,620 --> 01:08:43,805
And I was feeding my dog...

831
01:08:43,805 --> 01:08:48,046
...And all these blue and red sparks
started shooting up between my fingers.

832
01:08:48,593 --> 01:08:50,583
And all these little rain-clouds
around my head...

833
01:08:50,583 --> 01:08:51,681
...and sort of rained on it!

834
01:08:51,681 --> 01:08:53,090
Fan...tas...tic.

835
01:08:53,090 --> 01:08:55,954
It's ME...I'm on fire!

836
01:08:59,221 --> 01:09:00,162
Do you want a tug?

837
01:09:19,821 --> 01:09:20,975
Oi...you!...

838
01:09:21,544 --> 01:09:22,305
What?

839
01:09:22,305 --> 01:09:25,492
Suck my brother's fucking dick!

840
01:10:03,455 --> 01:10:06,194
What's YOUR 'glue'...a 'friar'?

841
01:10:07,648 --> 01:10:09,234
Are you alright?

842
01:10:18,006 --> 01:10:19,693
Tequila!

843
01:10:22,660 --> 01:10:23,551
Hey Tim!

844
01:10:23,551 --> 01:10:24,497
It's the cops!

845
01:10:28,682 --> 01:10:31,629
One thing I hate
more than fucking blokes...

846
01:10:31,629 --> 01:10:33,368
...is fucking dykes!

847
01:10:34,618 --> 01:10:36,371
Do you think you could turn
the music down?...

848
01:10:36,371 --> 01:10:37,934
...because the neighbours
have been complaining.

849
01:10:44,444 --> 01:10:46,209
And keep your little friend up there, quiet...

850
01:10:46,209 --> 01:10:49,300
...Because we don't want
to have to come back, again!

851
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:52,640
Tequila...TEQUILA!

852
01:11:00,924 --> 01:11:02,219
Fuckin' arseholes!

853
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:04,448
Ya fake arseholes!

854
01:11:04,448 --> 01:11:05,866
Take hold of it...!

855
01:11:05,866 --> 01:11:08,163
Shove it up ya fake A!

856
01:11:10,223 --> 01:11:13,182
Yeah...ya fuckin' fakes!

857
01:11:15,451 --> 01:11:17,990
Hey...how can you hate...
someone your pint size...

858
01:11:22,614 --> 01:11:26,020
If Chuck touches me once more...
I'll scream!

859
01:11:28,486 --> 01:11:29,688
Have you got
any cough mixture?

860
01:11:33,402 --> 01:11:34,631
I'll need that for my throat.

861
01:11:34,631 --> 01:11:35,857
Yeah...sorry.

862
01:11:35,857 --> 01:11:37,050
What are you doing?

863
01:11:37,050 --> 01:11:39,460
What exam's that for?
When is it?

864
01:11:39,755 --> 01:11:40,710
About a week.

865
01:11:40,710 --> 01:11:42,186
You're kidding!

866
01:11:55,142 --> 01:11:56,488
Piss off!...The lot of ya!

867
01:11:57,208 --> 01:11:58,213
Fuckin' idiots!

868
01:12:02,278 --> 01:12:03,217
Fuckheads!

869
01:12:08,979 --> 01:12:11,255
Come on, you fuck!...
Help me with this.

870
01:12:15,606 --> 01:12:16,694
Hurry up!

871
01:12:20,865 --> 01:12:22,956
Oh God...
Who's he fucking now?!

872
01:12:43,677 --> 01:12:45,557
Hey, Luchio, ya bastard...
Plug this in!

873
01:12:49,666 --> 01:12:53,665
<i>NASA has also just confirmed

A thousand dollars!

01:13:27,099 --> 01:13:28,745
I wonder how much heroin THAT'd buy!

885

<i>We wish to apologise for the cancellation

889
01:13:41,477 --> 01:13:44,219
- Oh, what would YOU know?
- Shut up!

890
01:13:44,584 --> 01:13:45,669
Fucking arsehole!

891
01:13:49,165 --> 01:13:51,517
I've seen this movie...
It's really great!

892
01:13:54,248 --> 01:13:55,759
- Forgive me?
- NO!

893
01:13:56,806 --> 01:13:57,844
I'm bored!

894
01:14:02,975 --> 01:14:05,743
Tim's goin' to have some fun...
say hello to the sex-maniacs!

895
01:14:05,743 --> 01:14:07,250
Hello, sex-maniacs!

896
01:14:15,817 --> 01:14:18,634
Davis...you're really stupid.

897
01:14:20,025 --> 01:14:21,862
Yeah...youse guys are idiots.

898
01:14:22,571 --> 01:14:24,415
Shut up!
It's MY TV!

899
01:14:24,415 --> 01:14:26,140
You're in front of the bloody picture!

900
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:29,724
- It's MY television.
- It IS NOT!

901
01:14:29,724 --> 01:14:31,560
Bloody well is so!

902
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:33,323
It IS NOT, Sam!

903
01:14:33,323 --> 01:14:35,579
Shut up!...
I'm tryin' to WATCH this!

904
01:14:35,579 --> 01:14:38,753
- That's Linette's mum's television which she gave to us.
- I think it's MY television.

905
01:14:38,753 --> 01:14:40,546
Bullshit! This is the one
my brother gave me...

906
01:14:40,546 --> 01:14:42,276
THAT's the one
that Linette gave YOU.

907
01:14:42,978 --> 01:14:44,861
That one with all the paint
and bullshit on it.

908
01:14:47,154 --> 01:14:48,660
THAT's the one
your brother gave you.

909
01:14:49,941 --> 01:14:50,913
This is mine...

910
01:14:50,913 --> 01:14:54,040
...and now it's on fuckin' fire...
and I don't want it burnt!

911
01:14:55,161 --> 01:14:57,411
Well, it's a bit fuckin' late now...
isn't it, Sam?!

912
01:14:58,899 --> 01:15:01,602
You know, in all the years
I've known Sammy...

913
01:15:01,602 --> 01:15:04,129
...I've never heard of him, ONCE...

914
01:15:04,129 --> 01:15:06,418
...having a single coherent thought!

915
01:15:07,133 --> 01:15:08,729
In the entire time!

916
01:15:08,846 --> 01:15:11,256
My brother Ed is gonna kill you, Davis!

917
01:15:11,499 --> 01:15:12,744
Oh, don't worry...

918
01:15:12,745 --> 01:15:15,022
I don't want to know...
I want to see the movie!

919
01:15:14,933 --> 01:15:16,227
...I seen in that film...

920
01:15:23,492 --> 01:15:25,773
Anyone for coffee...or sex?!

921
01:15:27,207 --> 01:15:28,341
What?...either or both?

922
01:15:28,341 --> 01:15:29,679
I want coffee.

923
01:15:29,679 --> 01:15:31,406
Piss off...or go to bed.

924
01:15:34,744 --> 01:15:37,855
- I knew this guy...
- Oh, yeah.

925
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:39,473
He was a friend 
of my mother's.

926
01:15:39,473 --> 01:15:41,623
Got to know each other 
really well.

927
01:15:42,878 --> 01:15:44,626
It's amazing how much
we came to suit each other.

928
01:15:46,847 --> 01:15:48,790
We'd think about things 
in the same way.

929
01:15:50,811 --> 01:15:52,747
There was perfect chemistry.

930
01:15:53,145 --> 01:15:54,818
You could tell
what each other was thinking.

931
01:15:55,345 --> 01:15:56,255
How old is he?

932
01:15:56,255 --> 01:15:57,510
41.

933
01:15:57,510 --> 01:15:58,412
Really?!

934
01:15:59,873 --> 01:16:01,279
It's not just physical, you know.

935
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:04,685
He ended up having these terrible fights 
with my mother...

936
01:16:05,699 --> 01:16:07,605
He'd tell me about it afterwards.

937
01:16:09,465 --> 01:16:11,862
He wanted to stay here and live...
become a resident...

938
01:16:11,862 --> 01:16:13,377
...except his visa ran out.

939
01:16:13,377 --> 01:16:17,266
My mother rang up Immigration,
and got him deported.

940
01:16:17,266 --> 01:16:18,487
That's terrible.

941
01:16:18,487 --> 01:16:19,500
The bitch.

942
01:16:22,185 --> 01:16:23,677
We've been hit!
Help!

943
01:16:23,949 --> 01:16:25,877
Women and children first!

944
01:16:26,742 --> 01:16:28,608
Thanks a lot, guys!

945
01:16:28,608 --> 01:16:30,284
Aah...shut up, ya arsehole!

946
01:16:34,572 --> 01:16:35,927
Come on, Annie...let's go!

947
01:16:40,312 --> 01:16:42,717
Watch it!...
I could get killed!

948
01:16:44,460 --> 01:16:45,593
Want to go upstairs?

949
01:16:45,593 --> 01:16:47,533
Oh...yeah...
That'd be nice.

950
01:16:50,908 --> 01:16:53,154
Watch it!...
The neighbour's here!

951
01:16:53,154 --> 01:16:57,998
For why? 4 o'clock in the morning!
Why for you do this?!

952
01:16:59,324 --> 01:17:00,443
Move!

953
01:17:13,939 --> 01:17:15,718
I'll see you tomorrow...
Alright?

954
01:17:15,718 --> 01:17:17,074
Okay.

955
01:17:17,074 --> 01:17:18,521
I'm gonna stay in Tim's room.

956
01:17:19,450 --> 01:17:21,068
- Okay?
- Okay.

957
01:17:21,862 --> 01:17:23,048
Goodnight.

958
01:18:21,186 --> 01:18:23,569
Gee, Chuck...what's that?!

959
01:18:23,569 --> 01:18:26,584
I dunno, Nick...

962
01:18:30,888 --> 01:18:32,285

of a small bungalow </i>

965
01:18:38,833 --> 01:18:40,443
<i>out there in space,
right now.</i>

966
01:18:40,443 --> 01:18:41,891
<i>It's empty and available...</i>

967
01:18:41,891 --> 01:18:44,126
<i>...with a beautiful view of Earth.</i>

968
01:18:45,578 --> 01:18:49,167
<i>Skylab...a bungalow that has
already had 9 tenants...</i>

969
01:18:49,592 --> 01:18:51,077
<i>The main purpose of Skylab</i>

970
01:18:51,077 --> 01:18:55,202
<i>was to make space flight more useful
to man's endeavours on Earth.</i>

971
01:18:55,202 --> 01:18:58,679
I am fucking warning you...
Why you play music?

972
01:20:05,833 --> 01:20:06,990
Oh...hello!

973
01:20:11,253 --> 01:20:12,975
At least I didn't miss anything.

974
01:20:37,491 --> 01:20:39,329
Bugger off!

975
01:20:43,990 --> 01:20:45,363
What the fuck's THAT?

976
01:21:05,940 --> 01:21:07,423
You're not USING anything...ARE you?!

977
01:21:07,423 --> 01:21:08,845
Anything what?

978
01:21:09,670 --> 01:21:10,712
Didn't think so.

979
01:21:21,209 --> 01:21:22,422
One minute.

980
01:21:28,452 --> 01:21:31,586
I wouldn't have to borrow any,
if you didn't steal all of mine!

981
01:21:32,504 --> 01:21:35,117
And don't you dare play
that bloody Eno record!

982
01:21:41,098 --> 01:21:42,868
What's this, Davis?

983
01:21:45,773 --> 01:21:48,059
It's a sheep, Luchio.

984
01:21:48,059 --> 01:21:51,489
Took a trip up the country last night,
and got you a little friend.

985
01:21:53,449 --> 01:21:56,002
And if you don't like it...
you can always eat it!

986
01:22:02,015 --> 01:22:02,831
I got it!

987
01:22:04,272 --> 01:22:05,550
Hey...what is that?

988
01:22:20,445 --> 01:22:22,404
I've never done this before,
you know.

989
01:22:23,576 --> 01:22:24,329
Me neither!

990
01:22:24,329 --> 01:22:25,642
Oh, bullshit!

991
01:22:25,642 --> 01:22:27,730
It's true...
I'm a born-again virgin.

992
01:22:33,629 --> 01:22:35,666
This is outrageous!

993
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:43,346
Would you believe this, Luchio?

994
01:22:44,430 --> 01:22:47,515
Typical of a bunch of spoiled
middle-class brats.

995
01:22:48,735 --> 01:22:49,778
Pathetic!

996
01:22:52,296 --> 01:22:54,397
Have you seen some of the girls
they have in here?

997
01:22:54,397 --> 01:22:57,079
They can't be more than 14!

998
01:23:01,927 --> 01:23:02,638
What's that?

999
01:23:04,423 --> 01:23:05,247
It's a sheep.

1000
01:23:06,829 --> 01:23:08,264
Don't you know anything?

1001
01:23:21,528 --> 01:23:22,479
It's not gonna fit.

1002
01:23:24,294 --> 01:23:26,577
Either I'm too big,
or you're too small.

1003
01:23:31,233 --> 01:23:32,909
Would you mind if I use
some Vaseline?

1004
01:23:35,218 --> 01:23:36,100
G'day, Tones...

1005
01:23:36,797 --> 01:23:39,074
Well you must've really got up
your neighbour's nose this time...

1006
01:23:39,074 --> 01:23:40,824
He reckons you've got drugs
on the premises.

1007
01:23:40,824 --> 01:23:42,966
You wouldn't have anything
like that here...would ya?

1008
01:23:42,966 --> 01:23:44,132
No...not that I know of.

1009
01:23:44,132 --> 01:23:44,904
No, I didn't think so...well...

1010
01:23:44,904 --> 01:23:47,194
I think we'd better come in
and take a look around...

1011
01:23:47,194 --> 01:23:48,526
...just for the record...
you understand.

1012
01:23:51,496 --> 01:23:54,670
Hey, guys...there's a bloody sheep
in my room!

1013
01:23:56,747 --> 01:23:58,216
Well, think yourself lucky!

1014
01:23:58,216 --> 01:24:00,062
Well there doesn't seem
to be anything here.

1015
01:24:07,606 --> 01:24:08,280
Anyway, Bert...

1016
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:10,014
You want to take a squiz-around,
out the back?

1017
01:24:10,014 --> 01:24:11,735
Yeah...'right.

1018
01:24:18,554 --> 01:24:20,500
Yeah, I know how you feel, Tones...
It's a bit bloody ridiculous.

1019
01:24:21,871 --> 01:24:24,477
I was at me girlfriend's place last week
...sharin' a joint!

1020
01:24:25,470 --> 01:24:26,470
And what happens?...

1021
01:24:26,470 --> 01:24:29,440
The blokes from the Richmond CID
decide to raid the place for drugs...

1022
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:31,251
Well it's MY head
that's on the choppin' block!

1023
01:24:31,251 --> 01:24:33,633
If this doesn't get us $1000...
nothing will!

1024
01:24:33,633 --> 01:24:35,235
Skylab...

1025
01:24:35,235 --> 01:24:36,371
There's a bloody lamb in here!

1026
01:24:36,371 --> 01:24:37,577
Yeah...well, anyway...

1027
01:24:37,577 --> 01:24:39,887
It cost me a fortune in beers
to get out of that one...

1028
01:24:39,887 --> 01:24:41,456
...unscathed...so to speak.

1029
01:24:41,456 --> 01:24:43,488
...we'll have to start drinking,
till we have sex.

1030
01:24:43,543 --> 01:24:44,828
What's it look like out the back...
pretty clean?

1031
01:24:44,828 --> 01:24:46,225
It's no worries.

1032
01:24:46,225 --> 01:24:47,572
Yeah...that's what I thought.

1033
01:24:47,981 --> 01:24:49,404
Okay...thanks a lot, Tones!

1034
01:24:50,133 --> 01:24:51,544
Lucky we got you guys here...

1035
01:24:51,544 --> 01:24:53,469
Otherwise there'd be
nothin' for us to do!

1036
01:24:53,469 --> 01:24:55,001
- Seeya.
- Seeya.

1037
01:24:55,243 --> 01:24:56,327
That's the stratosphere...

1038
01:24:57,364 --> 01:24:59,072
That's travelling through space.

1039
01:25:01,851 --> 01:25:02,732
The Skylab.

1040
01:25:06,524 --> 01:25:08,707
I think I'm gonna join
the Public Service.

1041
01:25:16,198 --> 01:25:17,040
Thank God!

1042
01:25:19,103 --> 01:25:20,467
Good luck, Luchio!

1043
01:25:21,038 --> 01:25:21,909
Thanks, mate!

1044
01:25:23,091 --> 01:25:25,575
Hey...look at what you do...
4 o'clock in the morning!

1045
01:25:25,575 --> 01:25:27,657
Not WHAT you do,
4 o'clock in the morning...

1046
01:25:27,657 --> 01:25:29,201
You play the music!

1047
01:25:29,201 --> 01:25:30,348
WHY you do this?

1048
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:39,776
- Hi, Tones...
- Hi.

1049
01:25:42,579 --> 01:25:43,604
Could WE have a word?

1050
01:25:43,690 --> 01:25:44,747
Sure!

1051
01:25:45,650 --> 01:25:47,239
I've decided to go to Sydney.

1052
01:25:48,216 --> 01:25:49,179
Really?!

1053
01:25:49,179 --> 01:25:50,843
- Yeah.
- How long for?

1054
01:25:51,749 --> 01:25:53,900
I don't know...about 3 months,
or something.

1055
01:25:55,685 --> 01:25:56,642
Okay then...

1056
01:25:57,799 --> 01:26:00,344
If you want to go...
I suppose you should.

1057
01:26:05,697 --> 01:26:06,455
Hi!

1058
01:26:06,455 --> 01:26:07,331
Hi.

1059
01:26:08,767 --> 01:26:10,718
- How are YOU, this morning?
- I'm fine.

1060
01:26:12,138 --> 01:26:13,719
I still love you...Okay?

1061
01:26:13,719 --> 01:26:15,693
If Barry comes around
looking for me...

1062
01:26:15,693 --> 01:26:17,359
...tell him I don't live here
any more...okay?

1063
01:26:17,359 --> 01:26:18,426
I'm going rock-climbing.

1064
01:26:18,886 --> 01:26:20,214
- Goodbye.
- See you.

1065
01:26:20,214 --> 01:26:23,902
I'll tell you why they fuck
sixteen-year old girls!...

1066
01:26:23,902 --> 01:26:26,240
Thanks...see you later.

1067
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:27,856
...because they're scared
anybody older...

1068
01:26:27,856 --> 01:26:30,442
...would tell them
what a lousy ROOT they are!

1069
01:26:32,625 --> 01:26:34,451
Bloody dykes!

1070
01:26:38,803 --> 01:26:39,501
Jen...

1071
01:26:39,501 --> 01:26:41,330
...are you coming or staying?

1072
01:26:46,909 --> 01:26:48,090
You don't HAVE to come,
you know...

1073
01:26:48,090 --> 01:26:49,383
You can stay with HER.

1074
01:26:49,383 --> 01:26:52,860
<i>A high priority is also placed on a machine
that would allow an astronaut...</i>

1075
01:26:52,860 --> 01:26:55,756
<i>...to move freely about,
outside a spacecraft.</i>

1076
01:26:56,491 --> 01:27:01,289
<i>Using the Skylab's upper dome area,
to explore this kind of flying characteristic...</i>

1077
01:27:01,289 --> 01:27:02,610
<i>The astronaut uses...</i>

1078
01:27:03,469 --> 01:27:05,220
Hello...come on everyone...

1079
01:27:07,128 --> 01:27:08,775
Where IS everyone?
Where ARE they?

1080
01:27:09,145 --> 01:27:10,531
Come on, ya bastards!

1081
01:27:19,193 --> 01:27:20,076
See ya!

1082
01:27:26,566 --> 01:27:28,316
It's just come in
from Thailand.

1083
01:27:33,224 --> 01:27:35,267
They got it through Customs 
in a shoe.

1084
01:28:06,354 --> 01:28:08,618
What's the address...
Do you remember?

1085
01:28:23,054 --> 01:28:23,979
Sammy!...

1086
01:28:44,101 --> 01:28:45,937
Hello...it's photo time!

1087
01:28:45,937 --> 01:28:47,882
Oh, no...what a bore!

1088
01:28:48,646 --> 01:28:49,833
Jeffrey!

1089
01:28:50,730 --> 01:28:52,331
Jeffrey!
Are you in?

1090
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:53,545
Hi, Jeffrey!

1091
01:28:58,694 --> 01:29:00,285
I want three 'tons'.

1092
01:29:08,444 --> 01:29:09,703
You want some?

1093
01:29:47,408 --> 01:29:49,127
It's great, isn't it?

1094
01:30:04,720 --> 01:30:05,440
Ready?

1095
01:30:20,681 --> 01:30:24,385
<i>Oh baby, what a place to be...</i>

1096
01:30:27,987 --> 01:30:31,566
<i>In the service of the bourgeoisie...</i>

1097
01:30:35,323 --> 01:30:38,616
<i>Where can my believers be...</i>

1098
01:30:42,296 --> 01:30:46,232
<i>I wanna jump into the endless sea.</i>

1099
01:30:49,169 --> 01:30:53,288
<i>Oh oh, the endless sea...</i>

1100
01:30:56,074 --> 01:31:00,063
<i>Oh oh, the endless sea...</i>

1101
01:31:03,425 --> 01:31:07,341
<i>I wanna jump into the endless sea...</i>

1102
01:31:10,570 --> 01:31:14,486
<i>Let it wash all over me.</i>

1103
01:31:46,206 --> 01:31:49,915
<i>Above us is a dirty sky...</i>

1104
01:31:53,099 --> 01:31:56,919
<i>Full of youths and liquors...</i>

1105
01:32:00,134 --> 01:32:03,814
<i>A little girl, a little guy...</i>

1106
01:32:06,566 --> 01:32:10,528
<i>This air can't get much thicker.</i>

1107
01:32:14,230 --> 01:32:17,990
<i>Oh oh, the endless sea...</i>

1108
01:32:21,123 --> 01:32:25,142
<i>Oh oh, the endless sea...</i>

1109
01:32:28,183 --> 01:32:32,243
<i>Oh oh, the endless sea...</i>

1110
01:32:35,387 --> 01:32:39,791
<i>Let it wash all over me.</i>

1111
01:32:40,657 --> 01:32:42,303
<i>And when you're tight for the rent...</i>

1112
01:32:42,303 --> 01:32:43,944
<i>You think you're gonna break...</i>

1113
01:32:43,944 --> 01:32:46,377
<i>But you know it's no damn good...</i>

1114
01:32:46,377 --> 01:32:47,772
<i>Just one more phony on the take...</i>

1115
01:32:47,772 --> 01:32:49,081
<i>You better go...</i>

1116
01:32:51,511 --> 01:32:53,325
<i>Oh buddy...</i>

1117
01:32:53,325 --> 01:32:56,329
<i>I really think that you better go...</i>

1118
01:32:58,846 --> 01:33:03,715
<i>Buddy...you better go!</i>

1119
01:33:17,516 --> 01:33:18,912
I've passed!

1120
01:33:18,912 --> 01:33:21,122
I've bloody-well passed
the whole lot!

1121
01:33:21,122 --> 01:33:22,624
It's hard to believe it.

1122
01:33:23,669 --> 01:33:25,955
Hey, guys!...
What's happened?

1123
01:33:29,103 --> 01:33:32,431
<i>The endless...sea.</i>

1124
01:34:57,329 --> 01:34:58,867
Lord...hear our prayer...

1125
01:34:58,867 --> 01:35:00,903
Welcome our sister, Anna...

1126
01:35:01,293 --> 01:35:04,802
And help US to comfort each other,
with the assurance of our faith.

1127
01:35:33,467 --> 01:35:35,369
<i>There's a corner to this room...</i>

1128
01:35:37,846 --> 01:35:43,234
<i>Where there's nothing left to remember...</i>

1129
01:35:43,234 --> 01:35:46,628
<i>There's time on the clocks on the wall...</i>

1130
01:35:48,062 --> 01:35:52,048
<i>But there's nothing left to remember...</i>

1131
01:35:53,950 --> 01:35:57,115
<i>A thought or two lingers on...</i>

1132
01:35:57,115 --> 01:36:04,315
<i>In memoriam the plaques on the wall
and time stands still...</i>

1133
01:36:05,225 --> 01:36:11,622
<i>Rooms for the memory,
rooms for the memory...</i>

1134
01:36:11,622 --> 01:36:21,335
<i>Rooms for the memory,
rooms for the memory.</i>

1135
01:36:22,833 --> 01:36:24,537
It's a pretty nasty business, Tones...

1136
01:36:24,537 --> 01:36:27,047
When these gorillas come
and knock down your door...

1137
01:36:27,047 --> 01:36:29,668
...and drag all your personal effects
out into the middle of the road...

1138
01:36:29,668 --> 01:36:32,406
...But you haven't paid your rent
in 3 months...

1139
01:36:32,406 --> 01:36:34,884
So, legally, you haven't got a leg
to stand on, Tones.

1140
01:36:34,884 --> 01:36:37,455
The best we can do
is give you 24 hours...

1141
01:36:37,455 --> 01:36:39,587
...and then you'll have to find
somewhere else to live.

1142
01:36:40,510 --> 01:36:43,818
<i>There's time on the clocks on the wall...</i>

1143
01:36:45,783 --> 01:36:49,516
<i>But time stands still, remember.</i>

1144
01:36:50,499 --> 01:36:54,357
<i>But there's nothing left at all...</i>

1145
01:36:54,357 --> 01:36:59,338
<i>But time stands still, remember.</i>

1146
01:37:01,033 --> 01:37:04,163
<i>A thought or two lingers on...</i>

1147
01:37:04,163 --> 01:37:11,296
<i>In memoriam the plaques on the wall
and time stands still.</i>

1148
01:37:12,452 --> 01:37:18,902
<i>Rooms for the memory,
rooms for the memory...</i>

1149
01:37:19,904 --> 01:37:29,396
<i>Rooms for the memory,
rooms for the memory.</i>

1150
01:37:47,944 --> 01:37:50,284
<i>There's a corner to this room...</i>

1151
01:37:52,912 --> 01:37:56,830
<i>A telephone, a chair, a memory...</i>

1152
01:37:57,819 --> 01:38:03,099
<i>But there's nothing left to this gloom...</i>

1153
01:38:03,099 --> 01:38:06,193
<i>When time stands still, remember.</i>

1154
01:38:07,246 --> 01:38:11,074
<i>A thought or two lingers on...</i>

1155
01:38:12,039 --> 01:38:19,183
<i>In memoriam the plaques on the wall
and time stands still...</i>

1156
01:38:19,183 --> 01:38:26,035
<i>Rooms for the memory,
rooms for the memory...</i>

1157
01:38:27,336 --> 01:38:36,065
<i>Rooms for the memory,
rooms for the memory.</i>

1158
01:38:36,065 --> 01:38:53,519
<i>Remember!</i>

1159
01:38:53,519 --> 01:38:56,856
<i>Rooms for the memory...</i>

1160
01:39:48,175 --> 01:39:52,334
<i>Remember!</i>
