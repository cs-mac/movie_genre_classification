HAVE FUN WATCHING :)

00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,900
& MISSING PARTS (...)  DUE TO BAD AUDIO -

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,300
- Town Hall please.
- Very good, sir.

00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,800
(OFFICE DISCUSSION)

11
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,100
- Yes, sir.
- My name is Lampton, Joe Lampton.

12
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:40,500
Ohh, yes you are coming to work here, aren't you ?
... One moment please.

13
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,600
Mr.Hoylake will see you right away.

14
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,300
Come in.

15
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,700
We didn't expect you till Monday.

16
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:06,800
Sit down.

17
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,200
We are not accustomed to such an excess of zeal.

18
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,400
But it's not exactly that Mr.Hoylake.

19
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,600
I'm not surprised that you wanted to leave Dufton as soon as possible.

20
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,000
You'll find big differences here, you know.

21
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,000
Not only work,

22
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,100
You'll meet a different class of people.

23
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,200
We pride ourselves on being civilized here in Warnley.

24
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:34,800
Dufton is not much of a place but ... we're not exactly savages there you know Mr.Hoylake.

25
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:41,200
You think not? ...Well, what did you come to see me about?

26
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:46,100
Well, I thought perhaps... you see I have to get fixed up in digs ...

27
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,200
You shouldn't have any difficulty.

28
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,500
- Soames,
- Yes, sir - You might come in. - Right, Mr. Hoylake.

29
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,100
You'll be working with Mr. Soames, Internal audit.

30
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,900
He's got dig somewhere near Top. Top's the fashionable district.

31
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,800
He's very comfortable, I beleive.

32
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,600
Come in.

33
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,700
Charles Soames, Joe Lampton. Lampton is the new man.

34
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,300
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

35
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,700
He hasn't got anywhere to live. Can you help him?

36
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,200
- I think so.
- I'll leave it to you then.

37
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:25,600
We'll have a longer session later on. I'll keep an hour on Monday morning for you.

38
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,500
This is it. And that's your desk.

39
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,600
Well, he didn't keep you long in the firing line.

40
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,500
Joe this is Mrs. Samson, better known as June.

41
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,700
This is Joe Lampton, greatest addition to Treasuries Department chain gang.

42
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,500
I think I'm going to enjoy my sentence.

43
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,200
I don't mind you enjoying, but you don't have to smack your lips so vigorously.

44
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,900
Hot tip Charles, dog in 2nd race tonight, interested?

45
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,000
No, but hold on a minute. Meet new boy Joe Lampton, Teddy Merrick.

46
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,800
God may help you. I got to run.

47
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,700
- Well Charles how about those reports ?

48
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,800
- Well...those Stampton reports now where did I put them?

49
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:53,900
Somewhere in ...

50
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,900
- Have you tried looking under your skirt?
- What do you mean?

51
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,100
You're sitting on them, love.

52
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,200
Ohh, really? (...) Seeing you.

53
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,700
- She belong to us?
- Where did you get that proprietorial plural?

54
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,500
I meant the Teasuries Department.

55
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,000
No, she's h. typist.

56
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,800
We have our own talent.

57
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,400
Now digs, Mabel would you get me an outside line.

58
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,000
No dear, it's not a personal call.

59
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,300
Look Mabel I don't wanna argue with you, just get me an outside line

60
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,200
or I will put a tuppence in your moral little slot next time I'm passing.

61
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,000
Constipated bitch, she think's she had shares in corporation.

62
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,500
Warnley  4-3-1-5

63
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,200
It's not for you lad.

64
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,600
But I can look, can't I ?

65
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,900
I guess there is no law against looking at women on street.

66
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,500
Hello, is that you Mrs.Thompson?

67
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,100
Charles Soames here. I was wondering if I might bring Mr.Lampton to see you?

68
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,800
Yeah, we'll be at the house long before that, thank you Mrs. Thompson.

69
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,700
That is as good as fixed and one of the best digs in Warnley too.

70
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,200
Is that what you really want ?

71
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,500
A clerk's dream; a girl with a Riviera tan and a Lagonda?

72
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,000
That's what I'm going to have.

73
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,300
Ha,ha... Come on, let's go.

74
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,000
Nobody ever goes to Dufton, they just pass trough it.

75
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:30,400
A sunday treat of fish and chips, wrapped in a greasy "News Of The World".

76
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:35,100
And chaps like me; prospect appetizing is yesterday's fish paste sandwich.

77
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:43,400
You know, I was a POW at least there was a limit to the time that you serve, but Dufton

78
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,000
it seemed like a lifetime sentence.

79
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,500
You shouldn't be so nostalgic on your first day away of your own place, you know.

80
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,300
I was looking at your river,

81
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,800
kids fishing and swimming in it.

82
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:58,800
in Dufton canal's like a sewer.

83
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,900
kids never had the chance to fish or swim.

84
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,900
And the people ... well I suppose they never had the chance either.

85
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,500
I assume here well... it's so different.

86
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,300
You wouldn't believe it Charles.

87
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,000
But you made Warnley sound so special Joe, so very special .

88
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,100
It is special. It's not Dufton.

89
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Not everybody admires the view from here.

90
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,200
Look Joe,

91
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,100
there's the Top, that's where the money is.

92
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,100
that'a a lovely houses up there you know Joe.

93
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,300
I'll have one of those.

94
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,500
I'm going to have the lot.

95
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:40,800
Ha, ha! No you're not! Not in local goverment you're not. Did you ever work it out brother?

96
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,800
In 20 years time, you could be sitting in Hoylake's chair, and that is as high as you can go.

97
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:50,100
and that means; a 1000 £ a year, a semi-detached  downtown, a 2nd hand Austin,

98
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,600
and a wife to match if you know what I mean.

99
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,500
I know damn well what you mean.

100
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,500
That's why I'm going to have the lot.

101
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,700
Oh, no no..

102
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,500
Oh, by the way what you do for entertainment around here?

103
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,300
Well, there's flicks  of course.

104
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,000
Teddy Merrick and I play snooker on Friday nights. Do you play?

105
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:06,900
Badly.

106
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,900
Oh, and then we have our amateur dramatic society "The Thespians", are you interested in theater?

107
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,600
Yes.

108
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,900
Look, it's only 2 weeks away.

109
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,500
And Charly Soames here as being a part among "The Thespians"  can probably

110
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,000
still get you tickets for opening night.

111
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,600
(PLAY) And then he went back to bed.

112
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,300
(PLAY) Yes.

113
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,700
(PLAY) To his own bed?

114
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,300
(PLAY)  What's wrong with you?

115
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,200
(PLAY) Did you really think I would know the minute I saw you two together.

116
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,800
(PLAY) There's nothing to know.

117
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,500
(PLAY) I have no idea what you're talking about.

118
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,900
(PLAY) You're all upset.

119
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:39,800
Who is she?

120
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,800
You should have seen her in the "Playground".

121
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,100
Sex, terrific.

122
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,600
Alice Aisgill. She's French.

123
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,300
That's her husband,  lucky devil sitting at the end of the front row.

124
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,600
(PLAY) Then I refuse to go to the court room.

125
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,000
(PLAY) You can't do that to him.

126
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,100
But she's not married, she couldn't be?

127
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,800
You mean Susan.

128
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,900
Oh, Susan Brown.

129
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,400
Yeah.

130
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,200
She's the daughter of old millionaire Brown.

131
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,000
He owns most of Warnley.

132
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,100
Have a chew too.

133
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,700
Thanks.

134
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Joe don't waste your time.

135
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,700
Susan is out of your reach, she's way up in the top drawer.

136
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,200
She had a couple of bad days. Finishing school isn't quite finished with her.

137
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,100
Hello Teddy, didn't you think she was superb?

138
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,200
I don't know what you're talking about but I thought she was super, didn't you Joe?

139
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,900
Oh, this is Joe Lampton.

140
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,300
Didn't you think she was a absolutely super Joe?

141
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,400
Oh, absolutely super.

142
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,900
I thought they were all absolutely super.

143
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,400
Well my children, what was it like out front? And where's June?

144
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,500
Oh, there she's talking to Bernard a foolish virgin.

145
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,700
What dou you think out there Joe?

146
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,800
Well that wasn't bad.

147
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,600
Oh, dabbing, dabbing us with that phrase. Come meet some of the company.

148
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,100
I want you to meet Alice Aisgill our leading lady.

149
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,600
Alice, this is Joe Lampton.

150
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:50,800
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

151
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,100
You're new here, aren't you?

152
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,400
Yes, I've only been here for a couple of weeks.

153
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,300
He's in our department.

154
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,600
It's Susan Joe wants to meet. He has a thing for Susan.

155
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,500
Hey Bernard, come meet Bernard. Our producer.

156
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,300
Bernard, this is Joe Lampton.

157
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,000
Hello June.

158
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,500
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

159
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,000
What do you think of Charles' door effect June?

160
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,300
It was like thunder.

161
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,000
That's the trouble with these literal minds.

162
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,300
The play writes instructions said crack of door.

163
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,600
That's exactly what we got.

164
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:16,600
(PEOPLE SPEAKING IN BACKGROUND)

165
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,000
Come on Joe.

166
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,200
Hello Charles.

167
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,000
Hello.

168
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,300
Was I terrible?

169
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,700
You were very good as a matter of fact.

170
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,000
I want you to meet a friend of mine.

171
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,200
Joe Lampton, Susan Brown. He liked the show very much.

172
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,100
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

173
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:33,900
Where's Jack?

174
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,400
Ohh, he went to fetch his car.

175
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,000
Oh, Charles you know that scene, the love scene

176
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,400
I tried to remember what Bernard said.

177
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,800
Do you think I do any better?

178
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,100
You were fine.

179
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,500
Hey Jenny you don't need to take that home yet, you know  we will need it again tomorrow night.

180
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,700
Why don't you leave it for Tilly?

181
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,500
If I'd only known...

182
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,400
You'd known what?

183
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,400
If I'd only known you'd be so beautiful I would have brought you some flowers.

184
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,600
There you are Jack.

185
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,400
Here I am.

186
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,600
You comin' for a drink, darling?

187
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,900
Oh, we haven't been properly introduced, haven't we?

188
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,600
I'm Eva, Eva Kent and you are Joe, aren't you?

189
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,400
We're going after the clearance, are you coming?

190
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,100
Oh, I'd love to but Jack and I have to go home for dinner.

191
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,100
Oh, what a pitty.

192
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,700
- Cyril !
- Joe this is Cyril.

193
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,400
This is Cyril, he is my husband, beleive it or not.

194
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,500
Cyril this is Joe.

195
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,400
- Hello.
- Hello again.

196
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,100
Teddy was telling me about you, Teddy Merrick.

197
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,700
I hope you gonna like it here.

198
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,100
I know I am.

199
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,100
You don't beat about the bush. Don't you?

200
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,200
I would look out if I were you Jack, I think you'll find you have a rival, for Susan's lovely hand.

201
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:27,700
Ha,ha..

202

Joe this is Jack Wales. Jack this is Joe sthg. from the terasuries.

Lampton, Joe Lampton.

204
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,900
You and Joe have a lot in common both being entrapped birdmen.

205
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,500
Oh, that.

206
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,500
What outfit?

207
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,500
Wellington's.

208
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,900
Hmm, sergeant observer ha?

209
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,900
Yes, how did you know?

210
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,800
Oh, I can tell.

211
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,900
Did you ever get beyond Wellington's?

212
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,400
No, as a matter of fact I was shut down early, spent most of the war in a prison camp.

213
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,600
Oh, is that so?

214
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:51,900
Must have been rough.

215
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,000
Well ... as a matter of fact...

216
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,300
Ha,ha come on Sue... 22:40 precisely. Operation Supper would begin.

217
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,700
Ha, ha what a stinker, don't know how you all stand it. Come on Sue.

218
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,900
Do come and have a drink with us first.

219
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,800
Well we'd love to but you know Papa Brown, he likes you on the dot. Some other time.

220
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:06,700
Good night all.

221
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,100
Good night sergeant.

222
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,600
You must tell me about your POW experiences but some other time.

223
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,900
I'll remember the flowers next time.

224
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,800
Good night. Sirrrr !

Freaking Officer.

226
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,700
Jack Wales was a POW too.

227
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,200
He escaped.

228
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:34,500
Are you ready darling?

232
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,200
Hello, Sergeant.

233
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,400
Shoping for lingerie?

234
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,400
What size are you? 44?

235
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:42,000
Listen, do me a favour, will you? I know all about you now.

236
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:45,600
I know you were a squadron leader with a distinguished war record, the DSO

237
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,300
and all the rest of it.

238
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,800
But just do me a favour

239
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,600
the war is over, stop calling me sergant!

240
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,000
I'll try to remember.

241
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,100
But sergant you're selling me short,

242
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,800
didn't anyone told you about my DFC?

243
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,800

And he just stood there. Watching this one, gloating over it like a bloody watch dog.

246
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,000
All phony acts and putting on a squadron's leader act with me.

247
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,700
Even threw the DFC at me.

248
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,300
If we've done what ever it was he did we would have only got a DFM.

249
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,900
Just medals, no crosses for us.

Different brands of courage, don't you know.

251
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,900
Oh, there's Charlie S., I'll see what he's on.

252

Here, isn't that Susan's father's works?

253
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,100
Joe you're wasting your time.

254
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,200
These two familes, "The Browns" and  "The Wales"s they are worth more brass

255
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,700
then the rest of Warnley rolls together.

256
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,500
Heyy, what you think about that one?

257
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,800
Hmm, not bad...but not grade one.

258
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,800
What you mean by that?

259
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,900
Time I filled you in on the Lampton report on love.

260
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,900
I 've got a full proof method for grading women.

261
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:49,600
Partly money, partly background and partly J. Lampton's instinct.

262
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,800
Now take Susan Brown.

263
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,300
Are you offering her to me.

264
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,500
No, seriously Susan is grade one on every account.

265
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,800
You just have to look at her to know.

266
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,200
Susan is not for you lad.

267
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,500
It just so happens that I like her.

268
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,900
You lust after her, you mean.

269
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,400
No, no, no. It's not that at all.

270
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,300
Well, it's partly that but not just that.

271
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,600
She's so wholesome.

272
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:13,600
And you think you'd find her wholesome if her old man didn't have a million in the bank.

273
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,000
There are plenty of other wholesome girls in Warnley, you know.

274
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,200
Like who? Like June?

275
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,000
Yes, like June.

276
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,000
Say you got you some kind of understanding with her?

277
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,400
Me lord Nooo! June's a good kid but she's got an invalid mother.

278
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,400
And they live of June's salary, the pair of them. So whom ever marries June

279
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,800
marries her invalid mother too.

280
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:34,100
What you and me should be looking for is a nice girl with no ties

281
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,800
and a nice family business in background, shopping.

282
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:42,200
Joe, 2, track 2. We got 4 to 1. What are you on?

283
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,900
Grade one. I put my 2 bob on grade one everytime.

284
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,600
In number 2 to win please.

285
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,200
How about that baby?

286
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,900
That one, she's grade 10.

287
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:59,300
Grade 9 and over means boredom on Saturday nights, you wanna keep miles away from them.

288
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,200
All on 4 to win, please.

289
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,600
Now grade ones like my girl

290
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:05,500
they'll be really something special in bed, you see that they have almost nothing else to do.

291
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,400
1 to win please.

292
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,800
Come on Joe, there's the bell.

293
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,600
That Brown he must ... , you know.

294
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,800
All those chimneys, that's money.

295
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,300
Beautiful, beautiful brass.

296
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,200
Belching out every minute of the day and night.

297
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:16,800
Come on.

298
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,900
You know Charles, I've been thinking about that dramatic club.

299
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:23,600
You remember you said you need man, a fresh blood and all that.

300
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,400
Did you mean it?

301
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,400
I certainly did.

302
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,500
Well I don't know if I'm really good, mind but I'd like to try.

303
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,100
Oh, I get it.

304
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,100
You're not interested in dramatics it's Susan.

305
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:34,900
Ohh, I know. "You're wasting your time Joe." But do you  wanna bet on it?

306
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,900
Did I here somebody say bet ?

307
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,700
I bet you'd never gonna get a length of a date with her.

308
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,500
A Dollar on it then.

309
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,700
Right then. Cut it.

Hello.

313
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,800
You know I never seemed to get a chance to speak to you.

314
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,100
I only joined the club because of you

315
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,200
now I here that you're not even in the new play.

00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,800
But errr...  What about the car for tomorrow.

475
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,400
What about it?

476
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,800
You know I was going to take Elspeth to Manchester to the ballet.

477
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,000
You know I arranged it weeks ago.

478
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,500
Well you'll just have to make it some other time, won't you?

479
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,900
Enjoy yourselves everybody.

480
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,400
Goodnight dear.

481
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,300
CAR DRIVES OFF)

482
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,700
Well I thought you said you were going to be word perfect tonight.

483
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,700
Well I thought I would till I got on stage.

484
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,400
Well Bernard...

485
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:37,000
You know what that means couple of days hard labor with his secretary.

486
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:37,900
Yeah...  Does she...

487
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,500
Shall I see you home?

488
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:54,500
No.

489
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,000
Alice, I hate to see you hurt.

490
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,500
I'm not hurt.

491
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,400
You sure you don't want me to take you home?

492
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,700
I'd like to.

493
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,100
I'd rather not.

494
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,300
Good night Joe.

495
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:44,900
Joe!

496
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,500
Shhh!

497
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,500
What are you doing here? I was just thinking about you.

498
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,200
You were?

499
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,800
I was thinking about you when I passed town hall and the thought stuck on.

500
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,700
Like a hangover. What were you thinking about me?

501
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:58,800
Nothing exactly.

502
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,400
What are you doing here?

503
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,400
I often come down here to do the library account.

504
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:10,300
You know Susan, you're looking very pretty.

505
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,600
Thank you kindly, sir. You think this is any good?

506
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,900
I wanted it, but there was a waiting list.

507
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:20,100
If you could wait for me for about 10 minutes, we can go and have some coffee together.

508
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,300
I can't, I'm meeting my mother for lunch.

509
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,300
Oh well... they tell me that there's a very good film on at the Regal.

510
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,600
The musical? Super!

511
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:28,700
Have you seen it?

512
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:29,000
No.

513
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:29,300
Would you like to go?

514
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:29,900
Yes.

515
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:30,400
When?

516
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,400
Oh.

517
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:41,000
You know Susan, you're not only pretty, you're beautiful.

518
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,400
Tonight then.

519
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,100
Oh, Tonight will do like no other night has ever done.

520
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,300
I'll pick you up at your house. At 7 o'clock.

521
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,500
No, I'd rather meet you there.

522
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,900
7 o'clock at the Regal.

523
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,700
7 o'clock then ... at the Regal.

524
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,000
Charles!  Lend me some money.

525
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,100
What for?

526
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,500
Come on. I'm late. I'll explain to you later.

527
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,300
All right.

528
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:11,900
Hurry up!

529
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,600
Thank you.

530
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,900
By the way do you remember that bet I made you the other day?

531
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,100
Which one?

532
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,400
At the dog races. Do  you remember?

533
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:17,900
Yes.

534
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,700
Well you've lost, you owe me 15 Bob.

535
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,800
Oh, NO!

536
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:21,800
Yessss!

537
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,900
You know, you're the sort of girl I'd like to take out.

538
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:28,600
Why?

539
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:37,000
Well, there's you're shape and you're size and then the sheen in your hair, sort of light in your eyes.

540
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:41,000
Oh but, the most important because I think you're a dear keeper.

541
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,400
- A what?
- A dear keeper.

542
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,300
What a lovely word! What does it mean?

543
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:49,700
My mother called me that everytime I asked her for something that cost more than she could afford.

544
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,300
I'd like to meet your mother, she sounds fun.

545
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,800
She's dead.

546
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:57,700
I'm sorry.

547
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,900
My mother and my father were both killed in an air raid.

548
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,600
I don't even know if it was an air raid.

549
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,300
The only bombs that ever do dropped in Dufton,

550
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,300
probably by mistake,

551
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,500
Anyway they had to fall in our house.

552
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,000
Joe how awful for you?

553
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,000
I'm terribly sorry.

554
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:20,700
It's allright.

555
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,400
It happened a long time ago.

556
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,300
Good evening. Aren't you going to offer me a drink?

557
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,000
Jack !

558
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,100
I thought you were washing your hair tonight.

559
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:30,700
Waiter!

560
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,900
You are not a hair dresser too, are you sergeant?

561
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,900
No, I'm not a hair dresser and I'm not your bloody back ...

562
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,100
A large Scotch for me please.

563
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,200
Don't let us keep you ...

564
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,200
Not at all, it's a pleasure.

565
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:42,700
As a matter of fact, I wanted to have a chat with you for a long time, about your acting actually.

566
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,400
I think you have distinct comic possibilities.

567
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,800
Don't you agree Susan ?

568
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,800
If you'll excuse me...

569
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:56,500
If I live to be a hundred, Jack I never forgive you for this.

570
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,400
I thought you were gonna wash your hair tonight.

571
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:05,200
Well I don't know what you were thinking there but I would take that away for a start.

572
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,700
I want to build a new administration block not a ladies lavatory.

573
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,700
We make machine tools at Brown's, remember not silk stockings.

574
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,000
You should never let this young man get so far with it.

575
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,200
I only saw a sketch Mr. Brown.

576
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,500
It looked very handsome.

577
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:21,900
You come back tomorrow with some designs I can use or don't bother to come back at all!

578
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,800
Either of you, go on - get out!

579
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,100
- Miss Bishop! -Yes,sir! -What
happened to that London call?

580
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:27,900
It's engaged sir!

581
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,000
Well will you try the other number?

582
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I must get those shares on the market before they close.

583
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:31,700
Very good, sir.

584
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,300
Hello, what are you two doing here?

585
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,500
Susan just told me she's going out tonight.

586
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,000
I want you to tell her not.

587
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,600
Ohh, why?

588
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,800
One thing, the number of guests will upset my table,

589
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,800
another it is that Joe Lampton again.

590
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:47,600
Can't you put him off for once Susan just to please your mother?

591
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:53,100
No, I can't. It isn't just tonight. Mother doesn't like him, she doesn't think he's suitable.

592
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,000
Do you?

593
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:59,100
I don't know about suitable but I like him. He calls me a dear keeper.

594
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,200
A what?

595
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:04,000
You'll explain to mother daddy, I'm sure you know.

596
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,100
Good bye...

597
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,100
Don't be cross. You know I love you both.

598
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,800
That doesn't get me anywhere with my dinner party.

599
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,600
Why didn't you stop her?

600
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,100
Because stopping her seeing that man isn't the way to put an end to it.

601
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:17,900
Then what is?

602
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:21,300
Don't you mind her getting mixed up  with a small town nobody.

603
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,700
Small town nobody sometimes do well enough. You saw that wrong once with one, mother.

604
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,800
I happened to be Susan's mother, not yours.

605
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:34,700
Now listen, would you stop bothering your head about Joe Lampton.

606
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,200
And just leave it to me.

607
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:38,800
Get me the town hall.

608
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,500
I have a minute to do, I thought we might have a little chat.

609
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,800
You picked up the work very quickly.

610
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,800
6 months now, aint it?

611
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,000
Not quite.

612
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,700
You're a bright lad Lampton. And you've also lover's sense.

613
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,400
Sense enough I'm sure and not to resent what I'm gonna say to you.

614
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,400
This is a small town, Lampton.

615
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,000
I've lived in it all my life.

616
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,700
I know the people, I know the business.

617
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,600
Councillor Brown for instance.

618
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,000
I went to school with him.

619
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:10,100
You know ofcourse he's the chairman of the establishment commity.

620
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,600
Yes but I don't quite see...

621
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,600
He is a powerful man Lampton.

622
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,500
That  engineering works of his, built it up from nothing.

623
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,600
Now it is the biggset of it's kind in Warnley.

624
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:24,400
Ruthless, well I suppose you've got to be ruthless in business.

625
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,600
He knows what he wants and he gets it.

626
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,900
He can drive a coach and (...) trough that commity anytime he wants.

627
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:38,100
Every councill is the same there is always one strong man, a danger man,

628
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,800
towns officials are concerned.

629
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:49,700
Mind you, no matter how influentual any councillor may be (...) but when it comes to promotion

630
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,300
there is the rump. That's a different matter.

631
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,300
You follow me Joe ?

632
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,400
I follow you.

633
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,000

Charles, you wouldn't believe in this, they are playing right into my hands.

795
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,100
They sent her away, they are scared of me.

796
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:51,400
Watch it Joe! Do you want me to drop these unspeakably delicious sausages?

797
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:52,400
Of meee!

798

Susan ofcourse! Susan's parents.

Now how can people get to be so stupid?

801
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:05,100
You know, all I have to do now is to sit under the tree and wait for the apple to drop.

802
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:08,800
For a chap just has been sperated form his lady love you don't seem to be taking it very hard.

Why should I care? I've got compansations.

Ha,ha,ha!

Come on eat.

Oh, darling... It's late.

807
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:34,600
Elsbeth suppose to be here any minute.

808

Come on. Put that on.

Oh, you are.. What's that word?

Insatiable.

That's it. That's what you are.

812
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:53,800
Old man, insatiable... You want coffee?

813
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:54,500
Tea.

Poor Elsbeth. She lands us her flat. And we pinch her all food.

815
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:07,800
You know, I hate you to put your close on.

816
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,400
It's very sweet of you honey, but I'm too old to walk about with my girdle.

817
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:13,400
Oh, you're not old.

818
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,800
Oh, yes I am. But you already knew.

819
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,300
I wish you wouldn't talk like that.

820
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:23,700
I'm 25 and I had a lot of experience.

821
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:24,900
I'm sure you have.

822
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:28,200
But my love you are very old and very mature.

823
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:33,700
You know, I never dreamed that it could ever be like this.

824
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:43,000
So good. There never was anyone so good to me before.

825
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:51,500
I'm alive now. All of me is alive. It hurts sometimes but I don't care.

826
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:53,300
Why did you marry him?

827
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,000
Let's not talk about it.

828
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:57,700
You're hungry?

I'm always hungry. (...)

Oui madam.

I'll get some bred.

Uh, I cut my finger.

I'm alright.

I like you doing things for me.

I like doing things for you, anything.

No...

You're so good to me.

I'll be good for you too.

Don't be so bourgeois!

Hello Elsbeth.

Oh, hello dears. I hope I haven't disturbed you.

848
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:21,500
I do try to be discreet but I had to come in. It was cold outside.

Let me get you some tea.

Hello Esbeth.

What an afternoon I've had, worse production my goodness.

852
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:32,200
Some of those girls, I don't know why they ever went into this sort of thing, I don't really.

Don't put your daughter on the stage Mrs. W.

If you give us a concert you will have some food.

Oh, lovely dear.

You're a lucky young man Joe.

857
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:46,100
Alice is an angel, a perfect angel with a heart of gold.

858
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:47,500
Cigarette?

859
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,900
I don't blame her as you're the sort of man I like.

860
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:52,600
Too many pansies around these days.

861
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:56,700
I knew a lot of real men once, they are all dead now.

862

Little mass like me carries on.

00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:02,300
Do you love Alice?

864
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:04,500
Yes.

865
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,300
I thought so.

866
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:11,900
She's crazy about you. You know that I suppose.

867
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,900
She doesn't know it herself yet.

868
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,600
Don't hurt her Joe. Don't ever hurt her.

869
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:30,200
No I wouldn't hurt her.

870
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:32,900
I hope not.

871
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:40,200
It's for you Joe.

Thank you Charles.

"I'm having a wonderful time. Missing Warnley a lot." Dear Susan, imaginative isn't she?

875
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:07,200
You know what that means, missing you.

876
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:08,900
Ehh...

877
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:10,400
And she's put her address on again.

878
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,400
That can only mean one thing, she wants you to write to her.

879
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:14,200
Well I'm not going to.

880
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:15,000
Why not?

881
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,400
Well one reason is she expects me to, second because I don't know what to write.

882
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,100
You're getting pretty keen on Alice, aren't you?

883
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:26,500
You worry me Joe, you can't do it, you know you can't woo two women.

884
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:29,200
Not in a town this size. Do you ever think about George Aisgill?

885
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:30,600
No, why should I?

886
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,000
Becasue he's dangerous.

887
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:33,400
Dangerous Aisgill? Come on...

888
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:36,800
If he ever goes after you then god help you, that's all I say.

889
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:37,900
Come on.

890
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:27,300
Darling, will you tell me something, will you?

891
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:28,300
What love?

892
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:34,700
Supposing you had met me when I was 10 years younger, would you have taken me seriously?

893
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:36,300
You know, I would.

894
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:44,300
Imagine me as I was 10 years ago and you, as you are now.

895
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:52,500
There were no lines then. Would you have loved me and wanted to marry me?

896
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:55,400
Yes. But I'll tell you something

897
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:56,200
What?

898
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:59,200
I like you the way you are now.

899
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:03,800
You'd like me much more when I was your age.

900
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:07,700
I've never known anyone like you.

901
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:16,900
Oh, I like to sleep with you, I mean truely sleep and wake up beside you in the morning.

902
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,800
How is the time, ohh...

903
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:41,200
Alice you're beautiful. I'd like to have a picture of you like that.

904
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:43,500
There is a picture of me in the nude somewhere.

905
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,100
You're joking.

906
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:46,900
No, there really is.

907
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:51,700
I was in the university at that time. And I met an artist at a party.

908
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,400
He wanted a model. I don't suppose it was even a good painting.

909
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:57,400
How often did you do this?

910
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:58,800
Only once.

911
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:02,900
Are you sure?

912
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:07,100
Ofcourse I'm sure. I don't tell lies, you know that.

913
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:11,000
You never told me. Why didn't you tell me?

914
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,000
Because I had forgotten about it.

915
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:17,700
Oh, darling you're the first. I didn't sleep with him if that's what you're thinking.

916
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:23,000
Why? Why did have to do it?

917
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:28,100
There are a millions of women a lot poorer than you in the world

918
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:30,800
who rather die than expose themselves for a few lousy rotten shillings.

919
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,500
Damn you to hell, I feel like, like to beat you black and blue.

920
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:39,300
What's it got to do with you?

921
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:41,100
It was long before I met you.

922
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:45,200
I must remember your beasty little provincial mind doesn't like nudity.

923
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,800
You stupid bitch, it isn't that at all!

924
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:50,900
Don't you see that it's the idea of other people looking at you naked that I hate,

925
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,800
it's indecent, don't you see?

926
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:57,600
Oh, I understand now what makes men kill women like you.

927
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:02,400
Oh, you're very brave and very moral all of a sudden.

928
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:04,700
That's what you like, isn't it?

929
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:06,200
Leg show and Lingerie.

930
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:12,100
It's indecent for me to pose for an artist who sees me as an arrangement of lines and color

931
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:16,200
but it's perfectly ok for you to kiss me all over and lay for an hour just looking at me.

932
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:23,000
I suppose it gives you a thrill. A dirty little thrill. I suppose you see me as your own private

933
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,700
dirty postcard.

934
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:29,000
You can't imagine that a man could look at a naked woman without wanting to make love to her

935
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:30,000
Can you?

936
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,400
If you want to know, I can't.

937
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:36,600
Elsbeth isn't rich you know. You needn't drink all her gin.

938
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,800
Give that to her and tell her I broke the bottle.

939
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:47,300
To think I ever let you touch me.

940
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:53,900
Now listen, I own my own body and I'm not ashamed of it.

941
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:57,000
And I'm not ashamed of anything I've ever done.

942
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:59,300
If you'd mixed with intelligent people,

943
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:02,500
you wouldn't be glaring at me if I've had committed some crime.

944
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:13,100
Oh, some of the things you've told me about yourself, I can just see you in Dufton now.

945
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:18,700
Looking at nudes in magazines, drooling over them.

946
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:25,000
Saying you wouldn't mind having a quick bash, that's one of your urge, isn't it?

947
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:28,100
The (...) girl's calling them shameless whores.

948
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,100
Oh, shut up!

949
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:31,900
You make a great todo about your humble beginnings.

950
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:34,300
but you've never really been (...)

951
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:36,800
You've never gone hungry.

952
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,600
What do you think a POW gets to eat?

953
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:41,900
Hmm, even then you didn't starve.

954
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:45,800
There always been somebody to take care of old Joe.

955
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:50,900
Got extra, tell me yourself.

956
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:54,000
Because you got along so well with the guards.

957
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:02,600
Why didn't you have the guts to escape?

958
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:04,800
Like Jack Wales ?

959
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:10,500
Don't mention that swine's name to me.

960
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:13,300
It was allright for him to escape.

961
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:17,100
He had a rich father to look after him and buy him an education.

962
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:20,900
Those 3 years were the only chance I get to be qualified.

963
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:24,500
Let all those rich bastards who have all the fun, be heros.

964
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:26,100
Let them pay for their privileges.

965
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:30,400
If you want that straight from this soldier, I was bloody well pleased that I was captured.

966
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,100
I didn't like being a prisoner but it was a damn sigh better than being dead.

967
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:36,600
Come to that!

968
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,800
What did you do 50 years ago back in the Great War?

969
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:56,700
You want some tea?

970
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:00,600
I don't want anything.

971
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:23,200
It was good while it lasted.

972
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:26,200
I mean that.

973
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,000
I'm sorry that it had to end like this.

974
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:37,600
I'm sorry too.

975
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:41,000
Good bye, Alice.

976
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:43,600
Good bye.

Yeah, whiskey... Oh, it reminds me

Good evening, Susan.

984
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:23,200
I hope you had a nice holiday.

985
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:26,700
Hello Joe. Have you met my father and mother?

986
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:28,000
This is Mr. Lampton, mother.

987
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:29,700
- How do you do Mr.Lampton?
- How do you do?

988
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:31,100
I've seen you at the Town Hall, lad.

989
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,300
You know his worship the mayor and mayoress.

One of our bright young man in our treasures office.

01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:37,600
Well, what are you drinking?

992
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:38,400
Scotch, please.

993
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:39,600
Make it a large one.

994
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:40,900
By the way, weren't you at M. Hall?

995
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:42,200
Yes, 551 squadron.

996
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:43,400
Oh, I had very good friend in that squadron

(PEOPLE SMALL TALK)

998

You come form Dufton, don't you?

999
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:03,300
It was Dufton, wasn't it?

1000
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:04,200
Yes, sir.

1001
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:06,500
Must be quite a change for you.

1002
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:11,400
How is canon Jones? I haven't seen him in... must be (...) years,

1003
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:14,300
oh, you know canon Jones, don't you?

1004
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:17,400
No, I'm afraid, I don't.

1005

Charming wife and terribly (...)

1006

You know J.C.Brotherton, I'm sure of that.

1007
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:26,800
I know him much in the same way as I know the Prime Minister.

1008
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:30,900
My father used to work in one of his mills as an overlocker.

1009
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:34,500
Now that's nice, don't you think?

1010
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:39,300
I've noticed this orchestra, year after year,  the older the piece the happier they are with it.

1011
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:43,100
Well, speaking of Dufton, an extraordinary chap there, Jack C.

1012
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,000
Checking his money around allright he's well on his way to Knighthood.

1013
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:49,200
And drove his father to a meeting last month, he's got a large Mercedes.

1014
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:50,900
Father said he drove like a maniac.

1015
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:52,600
You know him don't you?

1016
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:53,900
I don't know any tally man.

1017
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:56,600
I don't follow you old man.

1018
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,900
A tally man is... well he sells clothes on credit,

1019
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:02,200
money lending at fantastic hight interest rates.

1020
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:03,300
It's business.

1021
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:04,900
You wouldn't refuse the profits, would you?

1022
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:07,600
It's dirty business.

1023
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:13,500
Henry are you aware of it or not but this is our dance, good night Mr. Lampton.

1024
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:15,500
Well I'll see if you're gonna risk it with me.

1025
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:19,900
Come on Sue. See you later, sergeant.

1026
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:25,600
Don't worry about the way the world runs, lad.

1027
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:28,700
Enjoy it, while you're young.

1028
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:31,600
Hmm...

1029
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:41,200
Joe, if you are free I coud see you the dance after next.

1030
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,100
Joe, why didn't you write?

1031
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:55,900
You didn't write either. Only postcards.

1032
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:57,700
I was waiting for you to write.

1033
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:03,200
A girl can't write first. She can't if she has any pride.

1034
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:08,600
Why did you go away without letting me know?

1035
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,700
I had to, they sent me away.

1036
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:12,700
Don't you believe me?

1037
01:03:13,100 --> 01:03:14,000
Oh, I believe you.

1038
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:16,300
But that's why I didn't write.

1039
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:21,100
Because I knew how hopeless it was.

1040
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:22,400
Why?

1041
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,200
You know it's hopeless Susan.

1042
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,200
Tell me Joe, please.

1043
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:28,300
Well you saw them there, when I met your parents, the way they were needling me

1044
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:29,600
and you couldn't do anything about it.

1045
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,900
I wanted to, really I did.

1046
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:35,400
One day they will say you mustn't see that vulgar person again.

1047
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:36,300
They wouldn't dare.

1048
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:39,700
I won't ever let them come between us.

1049
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:46,900
It's useless Susan. You know it is.

1050
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:56,100
Let me kiss you.
Just this once.

1051
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:07,700
Don't you care about me?

1052
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:15,100
Maybe, it's because I care too much.

1053
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:27,900
I love you Joe, I love you.

1054
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:30,200
I love you too.

1055
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:32,900
Do you really?

1056
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Oh, Joe how much?

1057
01:04:38,900 --> 01:04:39,800
Very much.

1058
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:58,500
No!

1059
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:05,900
I'm sorry Joe, really I am.

1060
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:14,100
Gosh I'm hot!

1061
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:17,700
You shouldn't be hot. You've nothing on.

1062
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:20,800
Is that better?

1063
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:22,200
Is that what  prim Joe wants?

1064
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:24,000
No, that's not what Joe wants.

1065
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:26,700
You know what Joe wants.

1066
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:29,300
It's what all the Joe's  want.

1067
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:32,000
Oh, Joe.

1068
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:38,000
You know sometimes when you kiss me, I feel as if you're not really here.

1069
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:39,600
I'm here allright and I can prove it.

1070
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:42,700
Seriously Joe, there's something wrong, isn't there?

1071
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:44,800
Don't you like the way I make love?

1072
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:46,300
Ohh, I like it very much.

1073
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:49,300
It reminds me of a good set of mixed tennis.

1074
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,500
That's not a very kind thing to say...

1075
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:51,900
I sometimes don't feel very kind.

1076
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:54,000
- Why?
- Your mother and father,

1077
01:05:53,900 --> 01:05:55,700
were they kind to me the other night?

1078
01:05:57,100 --> 01:05:58,400
I can just see your mother now.

1079

Saying "You mustn't see that vulgar Lampton boy again or whatever his name is,

1080
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:04,700
the one with the bulging shirt and the chromium cufflinks."

1081
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:08,200
And then there is you... You lead me on so far and then you stop me.

What do you think I'm made of?

1083
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:17,300
It's not that I don't want to. It's just... I suppose I'm scared.

1084
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:22,700
I do love you Joe! I'd do anything for you Joe, anything!

1085
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:29,200
Except what any girl would do for the man she loves.

1086
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:33,800
Joe how much do you love me?

1087
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:35,400
Very much.

1088
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:39,100
About a million pounds worth.

1089
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:45,300
Joe be gentle with me.

1092
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:05,600
Oh, I know it's hell ride this minute but the way I look at it, he's the looser.

1093

Come on Susan, I think we'd better be going now.

1094

I don't want to go. I don't ever want to go.

1095

Wasn't it absolutely the most wonderful thing that ever happened to you?

Wasn't it Joe?

Yes... Come on let's go.

1100
01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:04,500
Must we really go?

That's quite a thought.

Joe, do you know I don't really feel any different.

1106
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:21,400
I thought I would feel terribly different but I don't.

1107

You don't really want to talk about it, do you?

1109
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,500
You're not really sentimental, are you?

1110
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:32,800
No, I'd rather not talk about it.

1111

Joe, do you know something? I do belive you are a (...) aren't you?

1112
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:41,300
I expect I am.

1113
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:46,800
Do I look different Joe? Do I?

1114
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:47,800
No.

1115
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:11,100
Hey, come on Joe, what are you waiting for?

1116
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:14,600
I think I'll hang on for a bit, I've got some work to do.

1117
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:15,600
But it's Friday!

1118
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:16,700
You can get along without me.

1119
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,500
For the last few day you've been lower than (...) belly.

1120
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:20,700
What's the matter with you?

1121
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:21,600
Nothing.

You won't be sitting pretty. You always said that Susan was  (...)

Yes, everything is going my way.

Ready chaps?

1125
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:28,900
You two go ahead. I won't go tonight.

01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:30,800
What's the matter with him? What's wrong Joe?

1127
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:33,100
I tell you, nothing's the matter. I just don't happen to feel like boosing.

1128
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:36,700
Come on Teddy, call me later Joe if you feel like it.

1129
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:13,700
Nothing has changed. Nothing at all.

1130
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:27,800
- I don't care about them.
- I don't either.

1131
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:37,100
I couldn't do without you. I love you Alice.

1132
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:40,800
I love you.

1133
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:47,400
Remember what was it you once said, loving friends you said.

1134
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:49,800
Let's be loving firends.

1135
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:53,400
I didn't want to fall in love with you.

1136
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:56,500
I tried to fall in love with Susan.

1137

What are we gonna do?

1138
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:03,800
I don't know.

1139
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:07,200
It's been hell these last weeks.

1140
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:09,600
I want you all the time.

1141

Not just stolen meetings.

Oh, Alice listen, couldn't we, I have a fortnight starting next month on the 15th.

1143

Charles says, he knows of a cottage belongs to a friend of his.

1144
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:27,300
We could have it for a few days for next to nothing.

1145
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:30,900
And there will be nobody for miles around.

1146

Just us, together.

Oh, Alice couldn't we?

1148
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:10,500
No, I've never done this before.

1149
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:15,500
Next time I do it, I tell you, it's going to be legitimate.

1150
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:19,500
Darling you sound like a lawyer.

I feel more like a (...) gate porter.

1152

Hmmm, not very flattering.

1153
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:37,800
Oh, it's nice here.

Yes...

1160

No, no I don't want to smoke and I don't want to drink.

1161
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:24,000
Because cigarettes and drink, they dull you.

I want every minute of these 4 days.

Very well, the answer is "Yes", sometimes.

1167

But Joe, you don't know about those things.

1168

They are not as simple as that, it's all mixed up.

You don't love him.

No.

You and him, well it's not like us, is it ?

No, it's not.

You're such a honest person. Why the hell do you have to be so honest?

1174
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:43,000
Darling I'm glad you're honest. I love you for it.

Do you have to go tomorrow?

You know I have.

1177
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:17,600
You know, I used to think it was a lot of romantic nonsense,

one man, one woman,

1179
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:25,200

any one of a 100 women.

Oh, I know you're my woman Alice. My rush.

And you've got all the love I ever have to give.

1184
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:48,300
You've changed so much, Joe, you know that.

1185
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:49,300
So have you.

1186
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:51,500
Yes, I've no more defences.

1187

How have I changed?

1188
01:15:56,100 --> 01:16:03,400
Oh, I don't know how to say it. You're stronger now. More sure of yourself.

1189
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:08,100
I was so angry with you at first when you wanted Susan.

1190

Seemed to want things for all the wrong reasons.

1191
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:17,800
And you didn't see how you were damaging yourself as a person.

1192
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:22,600
You weren't proud to be you, just to be yourself.

1193
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:26,300
But you're proud now, aren't you?

1194
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:32,000
Oh,yes, now I am the proudest man in the world.

1195
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:44,000
You've got so much Joe... Everything. You don't ever have to pretend.

Just have to be yourself.

Oh, no it's much too nice for me.

Do you want me to divorce George?

01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:15,700
Yes. But would you?

1210

Hmm,hmm...

Well I'm not agreeable.

You haven't any choice.

She's my wife and she's going to remain my wife.

I want to make it quite clear to you.

1238
01:20:49,900 --> 01:20:51,300
She has no grounds for divorce.

1239

Everybody knows the way you treat her, that's about you and your women.

But nobody can prove anything.

1241

I'll smear you both across the headlines.

How did you know?

1249
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:19,800
I make it my business to know. It'll break you because you

can't stand a scandal like that and you know it.

You can't hold her. Maybe she can't divorce you but she can leave you,

you can't stop her from leaving you.

Can you keep her?

1255

I can keep her because I love her.

1256

She's 10 years older than you and she hasn't a penny of her own.

If she leaves me, I'll sue you for enticement.

Then you won't be able to support even yourself.

You got everything pretty well worked out, haven't you?

I have, there are no loop holes, get it clear from now on you'll leave Alice alone.

1263
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,200
Because she's my wife. That's why.

1264
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:02,500
You trying to tell me you still love her?

1265
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:04,200
I'm not trying to tell you anything.

1266
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:13,300
I've let you off lightly. There will be no more warnings.

1267
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:23,700
Say that again.

1268
01:22:23,900 --> 01:22:26,000
I said, June and I decided to go steady

1269
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,600
and I wanted you to be the first one to know.

1270
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:28,900
That's just wonderful.

1271
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:30,300
Oh, Joe show some enthusiasm.

1272
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:33,100
Well I seem to remember you wanted a girl with no responsibilities

1273
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,500
and a small family business in the background.

1274
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:37,300
Well that don't seem to matter much anymore.

1275
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:39,800
Oh, what about the invalid mother?

1276
01:22:40,700 --> 01:22:41,500
Oh, I get it.

1277
01:22:42,100 --> 01:22:44,600
She's died and left you a large insurance policy.

1278
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:46,200
Hah, Joe...

1279
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:49,100
No seriously, what about her invalid mother?

1280
01:22:49,100 --> 01:22:51,000
Well don't seem to matter much either.

1281
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,700
(PHONE RINGING)

1282
01:22:53,700 --> 01:22:56,100
June is a fine kid, you couldn't have done better Charles.

1283
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,300
As a matter of fact, I'm thinking about settling down myself.

1284
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,800
That might be June. I'll be right with you Joe.

1285
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:10,100
Hey, Joe, it's for you, Mr. Brown.

1286
01:23:11,100 --> 01:23:11,600
Who ?

1287
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:15,800
God allmighty Brown, that's who. He wants to talk to you.

1288
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:18,100
Tell him my mother sent me touring on the Riveria.

1289
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,500
Ohh, no Joe, come on quick, he's waiting.

1290
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:21,800
Oh, let him wait.

1291
01:23:22,100 --> 01:23:23,500
Joe, what's got into you lately?

1292
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:24,700
I had enough threats for one day.

1293
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:26,200
Come on!

1294
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:29,100
Allright, I'm coming.

1295
01:23:33,900 --> 01:23:37,500
Yes? Are you sure it's me, you want to speak to Mr. Brown?

1296
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:43,800
Oh, yes.

1297
01:23:53,900 --> 01:23:54,700
What did he want?

1298
01:23:55,700 --> 01:23:58,400
He wants me to have lunch with him at the conservative club at 1 o'clock.

1299
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:26,900
Sit down. You're late.

1300
01:24:27,900 --> 01:24:29,100
We'll have the game soup.

1301
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:33,500
First time you've been in this club, is it?

1302
01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:35,600
This or any other Conservative Club.

1303
01:24:36,300 --> 01:24:38,800
My father would turn in his grave if he could see me now.

1304
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:42,800
Who would mind? But we are not bound by our fathers.

1305
01:24:44,300 --> 01:24:45,600
I've got a proposition for you.

1306
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:49,800
You're a clever young man, you don't want to stay in the Town Hall

1307
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:51,500
for the rest of your life, do you?

1308
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:53,900
Now is the time that accountants can do well for themselves.

1309
01:24:55,200 --> 01:24:57,200
Now, I'm willing to set you up in business.

1310
01:24:58,300 --> 01:24:59,300
Buy you a partnership.

1311
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:01,700
Well, what do you say?

1312
01:25:04,100 --> 01:25:05,400
There's a catch somewhere.

1313
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:08,500
Not a catch but a condition.

1314
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:13,000
I'll set you up on condition that you never see Susan again

1315
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:14,500
or communicate with her.

1316
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:18,700
Now just what's so funny about that young man?

1317
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:21,600
Nothing I could explain.

1318
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:24,400
If you agree I'll make you a rich man.

1319
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:28,000
You'll be a damn sight better of than you'll ever be in local goverment.

1320
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:30,900
Well, what do you say?

1321
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:35,300
Are you trying to buy me off?

1322
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:40,200
That's right. I'm buying you off and I'm paying a damn fine price for it.

1323
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:42,200
Come on now, use your head.

1324
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:45,300
You want to improve yourself, you want to get in among the money.

1325
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:47,900
Allright, I don't blame you for that.

1326
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:51,400
But you're not getting my brass through Susan.

1327
01:25:51,300 --> 01:25:56,000
You wouldn't talk to me like that I if I were Jack Wales and had a rich daddy behind me.

1328
01:25:56,100 --> 01:25:58,700
I don't give a damn for Jack Wales.

1329
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:01,400
A nice business merger between the two families.

1330
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:03,000
I don't barter my daughter.

1331
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:05,400
You tried to barter her now.

1332
01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:06,700
That's enough!

1333
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,900
I told you my offer, it's the best chance you'll ever have.

1334
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:16,200
Now take it or leave it but get this into your head, if you refuse it

1335
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:18,700
I'm going to break you.

1336
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,100
And what's more, I shall run you out of Warnley!

1337
01:26:23,700 --> 01:26:25,800
Everybody wants to run me out of Warnley.

1338
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:32,600
Let's say you kick me out and I take Susan with me.

1339
01:26:34,300 --> 01:26:36,000
She's in love with me you know.

1340
01:26:36,100 --> 01:26:39,000
Susan's too young to know her own mind, she'll do as I tell her.

1341
01:26:39,700 --> 01:26:42,000
If she disobeys me I'll cut her out without a penny.

1342
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:43,800
You mean throw her out.

1343
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:48,200
If necessary... I thought that might interest you.

1344
01:26:49,900 --> 01:26:55,800
No! ...
I say "No" to your bloody rotten offer!

1345
01:26:56,300 --> 01:26:57,200
Wait a minute!

1346
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:06,600
Now I'll tell you what you gonna do.

1347
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:10,600
Sit down.

1348
01:27:16,900 --> 01:27:20,200
You're marrying her with my concent, right quick.

1349
01:27:20,700 --> 01:27:21,400
Am I?

1350
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:22,400
That's right.

1351
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:26,600
But I don't understand.

1352
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:30,300
Don't you? The reason's very simple.

1353
01:27:31,300 --> 01:27:33,500
Well, I'm glad you have the grace to blush.

1354
01:27:35,300 --> 01:27:36,800
But why didn't she tell me?

1355
01:27:39,300 --> 01:27:40,200
Chicken again?

1356
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:43,500
I'll be turning into one soon, we'll have the pie.

1357
01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:45,800
I'll have scotch please, a large one.

1358
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:49,400
She didn't tell you because she didn't want you to wear her out of her sense of duty.

1359
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:52,100
And I didn't tell you because I wanted to try you out.

1360
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:52,900
Hmm.

1361
01:27:53,100 --> 01:27:55,100
There's no need to laugh like that young man.

1362
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:58,100
It isn't the way I planned to have my daughter wed.

1363
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:02,300
Now listen, you're gonna throw up your job at the Town Hall.

1364
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:04,700
I need somebody to reorganise the office,

1365
01:28:04,900 --> 01:28:07,200
I want some effiency in that side of the business.

1366
01:28:13,700 --> 01:28:14,500
Well? ...

1367
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:35,300
How about salary?

1368
01:28:38,900 --> 01:28:40,400
1.000 a year to start with.

1369
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:42,500
Naught, if you don't make a success of it.

1370
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:45,600
And that's just one of the matter to be cleared up.

1371
01:28:46,300 --> 01:28:48,100
If you don't, it's all off.

1372
01:28:48,300 --> 01:28:50,900
You've been too runny about it already.

1373
01:28:51,700 --> 01:28:58,200
Leave off Alice Aisgill. Now, I'm not gonna have my daughter hurt anymore

1374
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:00,600
and I'm not gonna have my son in law in the divorce court either.

1375
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:03,400
Not on account of an old whore like that.

1376
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:08,500
There's no need to talk about her in that way.

1377
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:10,500
I use words that fit.

1378
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:12,200
Now get done with her.

1379
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:14,400
I'll not gonna have it put off anymore.

1380
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:16,400
Bring coffee for two.

1381
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,300
I'm driving over to L.

1382
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:22,300
I'll drop you off at their house, Susan wants to talk to you.

1383
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:24,200
But... I've got to get back to the office.

1384
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:27,500
I told Hoylake you are taking the afternoon off.

1385
01:29:29,500 --> 01:29:32,000
You can fix just about anything, can't you?

1386
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:33,800
Just about.

1387
01:29:52,900 --> 01:29:54,600
I'll tell Miss Susan that you are here.

1388
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:12,500
(BIRDS CHIRPING)

1389
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:18,700
Joe!

1390
01:30:27,300 --> 01:30:31,500
Joe isn't it wonderful? I'm so happy.

1391
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:34,600
And now we are really going to be married.

1392
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,300
Why didn't you tell me about the baby?

1393
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:42,300
I don't know, you seemed so strange lately.

1394
01:30:43,100 --> 01:30:44,500
As if you didn't like me very much.

1395
01:30:46,100 --> 01:30:47,700
But it's allright now, isn't it Joe?

1396
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:51,600
Yes, yes it's all allright now.

1397
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:05,000
Joe, people have told me even daddy said that you,

1398
01:31:06,700 --> 01:31:08,600
you were having an affair with Alice Aisgill.

1399
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:12,200
How could you?

1400
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:14,100
She's so old!

1401
01:31:16,700 --> 01:31:19,200
Just an old whore like her, that's what you mean, isn't it?

1402
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:23,600
Well, it's all over now. So just forget about it.

1403
01:31:24,100 --> 01:31:24,900
How do I know that?

1404
01:31:24,900 --> 01:31:26,200
Because I'm telling you.

1405
01:31:26,700 --> 01:31:30,900
Listen Joe, if you so much as look at her again we are through.

1406
01:31:31,100 --> 01:31:34,900
I don't care about the baby or anything, I mean it! I won't be second best!

1407
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:37,200
Promise me, you never ever gonna see her again!

1408
01:31:37,100 --> 01:31:38,400
I can't do that.

1409
01:31:39,900 --> 01:31:43,700
I'm going to see her just one more time and tell her about us.

1410
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:44,400
You could write to her.

1411
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:46,300
I'm going to see her!

1412
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:56,800
Joe, you do love me, don't you?

1413
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:03,000
May I come in? Oh, hello Mr. Lampton.

1414
01:32:03,500 --> 01:32:05,800
I suppose now I better call you Joe.

1415
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:09,400
The sooner we get on with the arrangements the better.

1416
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:14,000
We decided on a white wedding inspite of the circumstances.

1417
01:32:14,100 --> 01:32:17,300
The first thing I require from you is the list of the guests.

1418
01:32:35,100 --> 01:32:36,500
(DOOR OPENS & CLOSES)

1419
01:32:37,900 --> 01:32:40,300
Darling I thought you would never come. You're so late.

1420
01:32:40,700 --> 01:32:41,200
Come on.

1421
01:32:45,300 --> 01:32:46,300
Got a suprise for you.

1422
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:48,400
Come on, open it.

1423
01:32:49,300 --> 01:32:54,900
Oh ...
You don't like it?

1424
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:57,900
Yes, I like it very much but...

1425
01:32:58,100 --> 01:33:00,000
If you don't like it you can change it for another color.

1426
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:02,800
What's wrong, you look so serious.

1427
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:05,500
No, I ... I like the color.

1428
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:09,000
Oh, Alice...
Alice sit down.

1429
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,500
You won't me be hurting my feelings.

1430
01:33:12,100 --> 01:33:14,100
I'm not touchy about things like that.

1431
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:28,500
I'm going to marry Susan. Everthing's fixed, even the date.

1432
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,100
I'm going to marry her.

1433
01:33:42,100 --> 01:33:43,100
I put her in the family way.

1434
01:33:47,500 --> 01:33:49,400
What did you expect me to do, run away?

1435
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:57,300
No, but that doesn't mean you have to marry her...

1436
01:33:57,700 --> 01:33:59,300
I've got to marry her!

1437
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:00,900
You'll be telling me next you love her.

1438
01:34:01,100 --> 01:34:01,900
Look Alice, please.

1439
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:04,700
Please don't let us have a scene.

1440
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,800
We were loving friends remember,

1441
01:34:08,700 --> 01:34:12,200
right from the start you said we were only loving friends.

1442
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:18,900
It wasn't possible anyway you and me, you know it wasn't.

1443
01:34:20,100 --> 01:34:21,500
Well, George wouldn't let you go.

1444
01:34:22,100 --> 01:34:24,200
If you had taken him to court, he would have thrown more muck

1445
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:25,900
at us than either of us could stand.

1446
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:27,500
I would have lost my job.

1447
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:29,600
Of what could we have lived on?

1448
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:40,700
You're a timid soul, aren't you?

1449
01:34:43,700 --> 01:34:46,300
I suppose you're going to work for Brown.

1450
01:34:50,200 --> 01:34:50,700
Yes.

1451
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:56,500
You've done very well for yourself Joe.

1452
01:34:57,900 --> 01:35:02,800
Finally, you've got everything you wanted, haven't you?

1453
01:35:10,900 --> 01:35:13,000
There's something you would never understand Joe,

1454
01:35:14,100 --> 01:35:15,500
these people are the top.

1455
01:35:16,300 --> 01:35:18,100
They are the same as anybody else.

1456
01:35:18,900 --> 01:35:22,800
but you had it inside of you, to be so much bigger than anyone of them.

1457
01:35:24,300 --> 01:35:28,800
You just had to be yourself, that was all.

1458
01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:35,800
With me you were yourself, only with me.

1459
01:35:38,200 --> 01:35:39,800
Try to understand what you have done.

1460
01:35:41,500 --> 01:35:47,600
Look Alice, I'm going to marry Susan.

1461
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:52,500
Allright, maybe I do love you, but I'm going to marry her.

1462
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:55,200
Now please don't make it any more difficult for us both.

1463
01:35:55,300 --> 01:35:56,700
Oh, to hell with you!

1464
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:02,900
You think our love is just like a layer of dirt, that I can wash it off?

1465
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:05,500
I believed in our love.

1466
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:07,100
What else have I got?

1467
01:36:07,700 --> 01:36:08,900
It's all I had to believe in.

1468
01:36:10,100 --> 01:36:11,900
You ask me not to make it difficult.

1469
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:16,800
But I'm not like you, aunt in Dufton, why should I make it difficult for you?

1470
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:20,600
Because it won't do you any good, that's why. I'm going to marry Susan.

1471
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:23,100
Don't say it again. Please don't say it again.

1472
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:31,000
I think we need a little drink.

1473
01:36:35,100 --> 01:36:38,300
Look Alice, I wish you face facts.

1474
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:44,000
I never loved anyone else. But there's just, isn't any future for us together.

1475
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:47,000
That was a pretty speech.

1476
01:36:47,200 --> 01:36:50,100
I suppose you worked that out before you came, didn't you?

1477
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,400
I'm never going to see you again, that's what I came to tell you.

1478
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:56,200
I'm going now.

I've never seen her like that before.

1484

She'll be allright, she knows her way around.

Miss Brown, if you don't mind my saying so, will make a lovely bride.

1503
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:10,800
She ran the car off the cliff at Sparrow Hill. I heard she was drunk.

What's that?

Alice Aisgill, Mr.Lampton.

1506

They say that the car was bent like that and blood all over the place.

1507
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:19,700
What was she doing at Sparrow Hill, anyway?

Oh goodness knows, she's been drinking allright?

1509

Probably didn't know where she was.

Yes. I knew her.

Good looking woman too, it's hard on Aisgill.
