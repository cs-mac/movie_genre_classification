1
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,060
Happy birthday.

2
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,500
Who is it?

3
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,860
- Mr. Jacobs?
- Yes?

4
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,180
It’s me, Frank Hallet.

5
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,020
Hallet?

6
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,780
- Trick or treat!
- What?

7
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,140
Trick or treat!

8
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:43,060
It’s Halloween, young lady.
Why aren’t you out trick-or-treating?

9
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,820
Oh, somebody’s birthday.

10
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:49,180
- Whose, yours?
- Yes.

11
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:52,500
- Well, happy birthday.
- Thank you.

12
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,660
And besides your birthday,
it’s also Halloween.

13
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,300
Can I tell my father what you want?

14
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,380
My name’s Frank Hallet.
Your father knows me.

15
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,780
My two kids will be along.
They’re trick-or-treating.

16
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,500
I'm just going along to make sure...

17
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,980
...there aren’t any real goblins
hanging around.

18
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,740
Like dirty old men who try to give
pretty little girls some candy.

19
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,260
Tell your father you’ve got company.

20
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:15,300
You better shut the door.
You'll let all the heat out of the house.

21
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:18,580
I've seen you around,
but we’ve never met, have we?

22
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:21,220
- You came over from England, right?
- Right.

23
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,300
And they don’t celebrate
Halloween in England?

24
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,420
No.

25
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,020
It’s a big day here...

26
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,740
...when all the kids get dressed up
in costumes and masks...

27
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,500
...and go around to all the houses...

28
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,380
...and shout, "Trick or treat!"

29
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,020
And you’re supposed to act scared.

30
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,180
And if you don’t give them a treat,
they pull some dirty trick on you.

31
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,260
You mean, no trick-or-treaters
have been by here tonight?

32
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:43,420
Well, there will be. My two kids
will be along here any minute.

33
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:46,780
One’s a green skeleton and
the other’s a Frankenstein monster.

34
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,020
What’s considered a treat?

35
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,860
Candy, popcorn, gum,
anything like that.

36
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,740
Would they like a piece of cake?

37
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,860
But that’s your birthday cake.

38
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,580
You shouldn’t cut it just for them.

39
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,820
Bravo.

40
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,740
Where’s your mother?

41
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,580
My mother’s dead.

42
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,300
But your father’s here.

43
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,340
He smokes French cigarettes, right?

44
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,940
Am I right about
the French cigarettes?

45
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,380
Yeah.

46
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,180
Where is he, upstairs?

47
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,740
Your father’s upstairs?

48
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,500
- No, he’s in his study, working.
- Oh, yes. He’s a poet.

49
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,300
My mother says he’s a poet.

50
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,340
And whatever my mother says
automatically has to be true.

51
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,260
It wouldn’t dare not be.

52
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,260
My mother’s the lady that leased
this place to you and your father.

53
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,580
Oh, that’s great.

54
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,780
The kids are gonna love this.

55
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,540
Are my hands cold?

56
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,700
You’re 13?

57
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,660
I counted 13 candles.

58
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,740
- That’s all I had.
- You’re 14?

59
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,380
L"II bet you write poetry too.

60
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,620
I'd like to read
your poems sometime.

61
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,260
Just you and your father live here?
Just you two?

62
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,940
Yeah.

63
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:28,100
And I'll bet this is
his favorite chair, isn’t it?

64
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,460
Yeah.

65
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,660
What’ve you got there?
What is that, a hamster?

66
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,700
Oh, let me see.

67
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,980
Well, I just wanna see.

68
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,900
What’s his name?

69
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,420
Oh, come on. He’s gotta have a name.
Tell me his name.

70
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,820
Gordon.

71
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:53,260
Gordon? He’s cute.

72
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,700
Shouldn’t you tell
your father I'm here?

73
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,820
No, not when he’s working.

74
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,900
You’re a very pretty girl,
you know that?

75
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,100
Pretty eyes.

76
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,020
Pretty hair.

77
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:14,900
Pretty girl like you,
and your birthday and all...

78
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,020
No boyfriend?

79
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,380
Come on,
I’ll bet you got a boyfriend.

80
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,620
L"II bet you got lots of boyfriends,
pretty girl like you.

81
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,540
It’s okay. It’s all right. Relax.

82
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,660
I get to spank you on your birthday.
That’s a custom here.

83
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,940
Yes, you get one spank for every year,
and one to grown on.

84
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,580
See, you got off easy.

85
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,460
Now, don’t get mad.
It’s just a game.

86
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,620
It’s just a silly birthday game,
that’s all.

87
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,540
You don’t think I was trying to
be fresh, do you? Don’t be silly.

88
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,820
I’ve got two kids of my own, you know,
and they'll be along any minute.

89
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,380
Here they come now, even.
Well, I’m off.

90
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,380
Thank you for the treats.

91
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:53,060
No trick on you tonight.

92
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,060
Hello, boys!

93
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,420
Tell your father I’m sorry
I missed him. Good night.

94
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,100
Hey, I've got some treats for you.

95
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:03,460
There we go.
One for you and one for you.

96
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,460
Come on, boys, let’s go.
Happy birthday!

97
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,460
Come on, boys, let’s go, go, go.

98
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,820
Jacobs, Lester and Jacobs, Rynn.

99
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,420
That’s me.

100
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,060
It’s what you call a joint account.

101
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,340
Sign here, please.

102
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:05,420
- Have you got your key?
- Right here.

103
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,100
You can take it into
one of these booths.

104
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,060
Yes, I know. Thank you.

105
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:24,100
Sign your name again, please.

106
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,140
She’s only 13.

107
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,340
My father has an account here.
Lester Jacobs.

108
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,460
Next, please?

109
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:47,940
Could I have that paper
with my signature on it, please?

110
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,460
Thank you.

111
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:22,180
Crab apples. No grapes this year.

112
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:25,100
How are you two
getting along out here?

113
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:28,340
- Everything all right?
- Yes, just fine.

114
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,340
You do remember me?

115
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,340
I’m Cora Hallet.

116
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,620
Your father leased
this house from me.

117
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,940
Yeah, I remember you.

118
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,860
- Where did this come from?
- It’s my father’s.

119
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,900
This belongs here.

120
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:50,820
That table and braided rug
belong over there.

121
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:56,140
Poets aren’t supposed to live
like other people, is that it?

122
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,780
I keep forgetting to ask him
to autograph one for me.

123
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,180
"I love you." Signed, "Father."

124
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,780
Nice and simple.

125
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,420
We don’t see much
of you two in the village.

126
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,780
Not even at the market.

127
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:18,260
Well, the market does deliver.

128
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,020
If one can afford it.

129
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,660
Do you want me to give
a message to my father?

130
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,620
Such a shame about those grapes.

131
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,220
Nobody bothered to spray.

132
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,380
I can give my father any message.

133
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,620
I came for the jelly glasses.

134
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,220
For as long as I can remember...

135
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,780
...the owners and I have made
jelly out of those grapes.

136
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:39,060
The glasses are in the cellar.

137
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,060
Your father’s not home?

138
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,860
No, he isn’t.

139
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,460
Oh, that’s too bad.

140
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:52,500
I was having a little gathering
at my house and I was hoping that...

141
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,140
Is he in the village?

142
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,260
No, he’s in New York.

143
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:02,660
When I was outside,
I could have sworn I heard voices.

144
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,340
Hebrew?

145
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,860
I should think French
would be more help.

146
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,780
Or Italian.

147
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:16,940
Lord knows there are enough of them
around these days to speak it with.

148
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,580
Are you sure you don’t want
to give my father a message?

149
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:23,940
So many outsiders
in the village these days.

150
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,980
Oh, from London.

151
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,140
- Yeah.
- I adore crosswords.

152
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,140
Well, you can take it with you
if you like.

153
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:33,860
- But your father’s doing it.
- I’m doing it.

154
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,300
And Hebrew.

155
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,460
My son’s children tell me...

156
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:43,220
...you gave them some birthday cake
the other night.

157
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,580
He came inside the house?

158
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,580
- My son?
- Yeah, he came inside.

159
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,820
Your father?

160
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,220
Your father was here that evening?

161
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,580
He was in his study.

162
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,500
When he’s working,
he can’t be disturbed.

163
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:01,420
Since that evening,
my son’s been back?

164
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,100
No.

165
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,580
- Not been back at all?
- No.

166
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,500
If my son should come back
and your father isn’t here...

167
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:14,100
...it might be better
if you didn’t let him in.

168
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,540
Well, he didn’t ask
my permission the first time.

169
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,740
I hope you didn’t intend that
to sound so rude.

170
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:25,060
L"II tell my father you said not to let
your son inside the door.

171
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,860
That won’t be necessary.

172
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:29,420
Maybe I don’t understand
what you want, Mrs. Hallet.

173
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,140
One thing I certainly do not want...

174
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:34,620
...is to go on and on about something
that doesn’t matter in the slightest.

175
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,580
I came for jelly glasses.
We'll get them now.

176
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,140
Your son says I have pretty hair.

177
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,980
Did he tell you that?

178
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,220
We’ll get the glasses now.

179
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,620
They’re in the cellar.

180
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,980
We’ll move this table...

181
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,260
...so I can get the rug up
and raise the trap door.

182
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:56,180
My father and I like the table
where it is.

183
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,860
But the glasses are in the cellar.

184
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,540
L"II get them for you later,
Mrs. Hallet.

185
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,980
Move the table.

186
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,020
This is my house.

187
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,140
You are an extraordinarily
rude little girl...

188
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,220
...who’s going to do exactly as I say.

189
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,500
Last week you took
the only good grapes we have...

190
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,860
...and now the crab apples.

191
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,420
And you never asked if you might.

192
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,300
And today you just walked
bang into my house!

193
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,420
- This is not your house!
- My house!

194
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,900
Leased.

195
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,900
You’re 13.

196
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,780
Why aren’t you in school?

197
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,780
Thirteen means I have no rights,
is that it?

198
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:35,020
Thirteen means
you should be in school.

199
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,580
- Look at me when I speak to you.
- I study at home.

200
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,540
It so happens I’m a member
of the school board.

201
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:47,420
When we meet on Monday,
they’ll be very interested in your case.

202
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,620
Now, where’s your father?

203
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:53,220
- I told you, he’s in New York.
- Exactly where in New York?

204
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,340
He’s having lunch
with his publisher.

205
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,180
I want the publisher’s
telephone number.

206
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:00,020
- I don’t have it.
- The publisher’s name?

207
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,300
This one’s London.

208
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:14,380
Your father will telephone me the
moment he comes back, understood?

209
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,900
This is my house.

210
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,900
What are you doing here?

211
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,300
It’s Saturday afternoon.
Why aren’t you at the game?

212
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,820
I’ve gotta do this report
on government...

213
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,660
...and I need to know when
the school board holds its meetings.

214
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,500
Well, would it help you to visit one?

215
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:31,180
No. Actually, all I really need
to know is when it meets.

216
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,580
Twice monthly.

217
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,660
Someone told me
it’s meeting this Monday.

218
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:38,620
No, the board meets again
a week from Thursday.

219
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,740
These are the bylaws.

220
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:45,220
- If you need any further help...
- No. This is super. Thank you.

221
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,380
But you shouldn’t be working now.
You should be at the ball game.

222
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,460
The Wildcats need
all the help they can get.

223
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,820
Whose class are you doing
the paper for?

224
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,300
Excuse me. Maybe I can
get there by halftime.

225
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:07,620
You’re a liar, Mrs. Hallet.
You’re a liar.

226
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,980
Rynn, where you going?

227
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:20,940
Back home.

228
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,100
If you can wait a second,
I’ll give you a lift.

229
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,900
No, really. I’m fine.

230
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,980
I was hoping maybe you and...

231
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,260
Some other time, then.

232
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,820
Could you give your mother
a message for me?

233
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,620
Tell her I have those jelly glasses...

234
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,140
...and any time she wants to come by,
they’ll be there.

235
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,940
I can come by later myself,
if you like.

236
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:41,540
I think it'd be better if she came.
My father wants to talk to her.

237
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,140
Yeah, I’ll tell her.

238
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,540
- Everything all right, miss?
- Fine, officer.

239
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:50,020
I mean, he wasn’t bothering you,
was he?

240
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,100
Mr. Hallet?

241
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,580
Your folks let you wander
around town by yourself?

242
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,900
I live with my father. He lets me
come into town when I want.

243
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,940
- What’s your name?
- Rynn Jacobs.

244
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,740
Do you have a name, officer?

245
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:05,100
Oh, sure, yeah. Sorry.
The name’s Miglioriti.

246
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,500
- Miglioriti.
- Yeah. You got it.

247
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,100
But call me Ron.

248
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,780
Miglioriti. That’s a nice name.

249
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,260
It’s Italian.

250
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,140
It’s hard for most Americans.

251
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,060
And have the Miglioritis been living
in this town a long time?

252
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:21,220
Hey, you sound like you’ve been
talking to Mrs. Hallet.

253
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,940
To her, if you weren’t on
the first ship that put in here...

254
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,500
...you'll always be an immigrant.

255
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,500
I guess we’re the newest,
me and my father.

256
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,500
You’ve been here, what,
a couple of months?

257
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,180
Yeah, about that.

258
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,260
Like it?

259
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:37,500
- Is school okay?
- Yeah, it’s okay.

260
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,220
- Yeah, being new isn’t easy.
- There’s the lane.

261
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,700
Around here, folks can be
a little cold at first...

262
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:46,780
...but when you’ve been here longer,
they’ll seem even colder.

263
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,380
Thanks for the ride.

264
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,980
Maybe I could have
a talk with your father.

265
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:57,100
- Why?
- Nothing to worry your head about.

266
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,820
Well, I can’t disturb him
when he’s working.

267
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,060
Yeah, well, let’s see if he is.

268
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:09,940
Sorry, he’s working.
He’s translating some Russian poetry.

269
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,900
When that door’s locked,
I can’t bother him.

270
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,260
I suspect the only reason Mrs. Hallet
lets us into her village...

271
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,100
...is because my father’s a poet.

272
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,780
Mrs. Hallet loves poets.

273
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,420
That’s one of his books over there.

274
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,140
- He wrote that, huh?
- Yeah.

275
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,660
Want him to sign a copy for you?

276
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,860
Yeah, sure. I never met a real poet.

277
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,700
I mean, look, don’t laugh at me...

278
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,220
...but I can’t believe
people like poetry.

279
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:39,660
I’m not talking about that
birthday-card stuff, but real poetry.

280
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,820
I mean, when it doesn’t even rhyme.

281
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,420
No, I’m not laughing at you.

282
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:47,140
My father says that most people
who say they like poetry...

283
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,340
...only pretend to like it.
You’re honest.

284
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,140
He’s your favorite poet, huh?

285
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,980
No. He’s my father.

286
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,620
Emily Dickinson’s my favorite.

287
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,660
Emily Dickinson, yeah.

288
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:02,940
You know, it can be pretty nice here
in the village once you get used to it.

289
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,220
And just don’t let Mrs. Hallet
hassle you.

290
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,980
Her son says I’m a pretty girl.

291
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,220
That what he said?

292
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,700
What is he, a pervert?

293
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,780
I guess that means little girls
shouldn’t accept candy from him.

294
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,660
- Not if they’re smart little girls.
- Don’t worry, I won’t.

295
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,700
I’m glad you came by, though.

296
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,620
Yeah, me too, I’m glad, but...

297
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,580
Do you like turkey?

298
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,900
Well, to tell you the truth, no.

299
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,820
You know, birds are reptiles
from way back.

300
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:31,900
Biologically.

301
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,420
Yeah, well, then I guess you don’t
wanna buy a raffle ticket, huh?

302
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:38,300
You mean if we buy a raffle ticket,
we might win a turkey?

303
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,860
For Thanksgiving.
Yeah, a big 20-pounder.

304
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:43,180
- A big turkey, huh?
- Yeah.

305
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,140
Yeah, all right, we'll take two tickets.

306
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,180
Two dollars.

307
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:02,260
Look, I really hate to do this,
you know? I mean...

308
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,940
It’s all right.

309
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:07,140
Hold on. Here.

310
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:10,340
There’s one for you,
and one for your father.

311
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,620
And we’ll see which one’s
the lucky one, okay?

312
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,140
All right.

313
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:19,300
- Thank your father too.
- Sure.

314
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:25,580
- See you around.
- Bye-bye.

315
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,540
Hello?

316
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:37,380
- I may come in.
- I invited you, Mrs. Hallet.

317
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,820
We had a meeting
of the school board this morning.

318
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,380
I spoke to them about you.

319
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:46,580
I must say, when they heard about
your case, they were very interested.

320
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,420
I was just about to put a kettle on.
Would you like some tea?

321
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,100
Very interested in your case.

322
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,340
You don’t wanna hear
what they said?

323
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,220
As for tea, Darjeeling or Earl Grey?

324
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:02,340
I came here prepared
to forget about yesterday...

325
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:06,300
...but I must say, I don’t care for
your tone any better today.

326
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,300
Well, then it’s up to me to apologize.

327
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,980
What I find particularly surprising...

328
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:14,100
...is that most boys and girls
who are educated in England...

329
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,740
...are so well-behaved.

330
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,700
What did you decide for the tea?

331
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:21,140
Not a glass of that thick,
sweet wine...

332
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:24,700
...you people use
in your religious rituals?

333
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:27,460
Or aren’t you old enough
to drink wine?

334
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,740
You told my son 14,
you told me 13.

335
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,260
Now, which is it to be?

336
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:35,700
- Thirteen.
- And brilliant.

337
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:39,100
As so many of your people are.

338
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:43,980
Mrs. Hallet, will you please accept my
apology for what happened yesterday?

339
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,660
I’m afraid it isn’t that simple.

340
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:50,020
You told my son your father
wished to speak to me?

341
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:55,420
I certainly wish to speak to him.
Call him.

342
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,140
Well, he’s translating right now.

343
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:00,260
I couldn’t disturb him
even for Officer Miglioriti.

344
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:03,420
Officer Miglioriti works
for people like me.

345
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,180
In case you’re wondering...

346
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:08,260
...I’m waiting right here
until you do call your father.

347
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,180
You never answered about the tea.

348
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:13,340
I can’t imagine what made any of us
think you could be happy here.

349
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,500
My father and I love this house.

350
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:19,020
No, I think we’ll make other plans.

351
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:21,860
Our lease is for three years.

352
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,700
Leases have known to be broken.

353
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:29,180
Unless, of course, your father and I
could come to some understanding.

354
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,020
And what would that be,
Mrs. Hallet?

355
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:33,980
There it is again,
that continual mocking tone.

356
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,220
And don’t look at me with
those hurt eyes...

357
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:38,100
...and pretend you’ve been
misunderstood.

358
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:41,700
You and I both know
you say exactly what you intend.

359
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,460
Here are your glasses, Mrs. Hallet.

360
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,700
I’m being dismissed?

361
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,580
Call your father. Right this minute.

362
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:55,380
Not when he’s working.

363
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:59,780
You and I know perfectly well
he isn’t there.

364
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:03,260
Go in that study, Mrs. Hallet,
and I tell my father about your son.

365
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:06,660
- My son?
- About Halloween.

366
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,260
I haven’t told my father yet.

367
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,980
- Told your father what?
- What happened here.

368
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,460
Everybody in the village
knows about your son.

369
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:18,820
Miglioriti. He’s a liar.
He hates my son.

370
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:22,300
Did he tell you he had an affair with my
son’s wife before they were married?

371
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,580
I even had to ask him why the police
don’t do anything about it.

372
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,420
Why should they do anything?

373
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,980
When your son gives candy
to pretty little girls?

374
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,060
Your jelly glasses, Mrs. Hallet.

375
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:39,140
- You are gonna get out of this house.
- My house!

376
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:42,020
With or without your father!

377
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:47,060
Sure, this is a lonely place.
Often I’m alone.

378
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,740
That doesn’t worry me, Mrs. Hallet.

379
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:52,500
And if it worries you, that’s a problem
you’d better take up with your son.

380
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,940
Goddamn you!

381
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,780
No seals.

382
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:05,980
Without rubber seals,
these glasses are worthless.

383
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,260
The seals are in the cellar.

384
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:12,220
And this time, don’t you dare
tell me to come back later.

385
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,340
Get out of my house!

386
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,980
I’m warning you, Mrs. Hallet.

387
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:21,380
Get out of my house!

388
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:28,140
Mrs. Hallet, I’m warning you!

389
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:45,020
Hi. You been driving long?

390
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,300
How come you’re in this car?

391
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:53,100
- How come you’re dressed like that?
- Because I’m a magician.

392
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:55,460
And what’s that, your magic wand?

393
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:59,580
Oh, it’s my cane. I’m a cripple.

394
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:03,340
- I guess I should say I’m sorry.
- Why? It’s not your fault.

395
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:06,380
Saturday, when all my brothers
are playing football...

396
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,900
...I’m putting on a magic show...

397
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:11,300
...for some rich kid’s birthday party.

398
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,380
Let’s see you do something magic.

399
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:17,140
Say, aren’t you too young to drive?

400
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,100
Well, my neighbor’s
supposed to take it.

401
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:22,500
My father’s really counting on it
being at the station when he gets in.

402
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:24,460
You think you could take it?
I can pay you.

403
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:27,260
Say, you know you got
a chipped tooth?

404
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:32,460
- How come I never see you in school?
- I don’t go to school.

405
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:37,260
- You sick or something?
- No, school is stultifying.

406
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,980
You say this was your father’s car?

407
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:42,300
No, no. What I said was that
my father needs it at the station.

408
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:45,620
- It’s hers.
- Whose?

409
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,700
Old lady Hallet's.

410
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:51,540
It’s a beauty.
Only 34,000 miles on it.

411
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,220
I ought to know.

412
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,460
My father has a service station.
He works on it.

413
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:58,060
- She’s lending it to us.
- No way.

414
00:31:58,740 --> 00:31:59,940
She’s letting my father.

415
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:02,340
She won’t even let
her own creep son drive it.

416
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:07,020
- Here’s $5.
- I’m already late for my magic show.

417
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:12,740
You gonna come back afterwards?

418
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,700
Please?

419
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:19,500
- Look, I need your help.
- Maybe after the magic show.

420
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,380
You promise?

421
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,780
Ma, the new trick with the hand puppet
went over really big.

422
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:41,100
I’m still here at the birthday party.

423
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:45,180
No, Ma, they asked me, really.
They asked me to stay for dinner too.

424
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,500
Just hamburgers and Cokes.

425
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:50,700
Come on, tell Tom he can take her
to the movie for a change.

426
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,820
It’s his turn anyway.

427
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:55,300
Look, I’ll talk to you later, okay?
Good...

428
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:00,260
Yeah, yeah, okay.
Yeah, yeah, okay. Bye-bye.

429
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:03,620
You don’t have any
brothers or sisters, do you?

430
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:04,980
No.

431
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,820
That’s something
I can’t even imagine.

432
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:10,260
- Hey, light the candles, huh?
- Yeah, sure.

433
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,540
- Hey, that’s a pretty dress.
- Thanks.

434
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,060
My father and I bought it
in Morocco.

435
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,940
Hey, they smoke a lot of hash there.

436
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,220
They do a lot of things there.

437
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,820
Did you ever smoke hash?

438
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,300
Hundreds of times.

439
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,180
- Yeah? No kidding?
- Yeah.

440
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:32,420
You’re a regular hippie, huh?

441
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,900
No, not really.

442
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:40,300
Go ahead, sit down.
Want some wine?

443
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,900
- Do you?
- No, I hate it.

444
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,420
Me too.

445
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,580
You’re a pretty good cook.

446
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:08,060
- Is that so surprising?
- I only meant for being 13 and all.

447
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:12,380
How old do you have to be before
people start treating you like a person?

448
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,380
- Hey, Mario.
- Yeah?

449
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:16,460
Thanks about the car and stuff.

450
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:20,700
You know, you may be smart,
but you’re stupid.

451
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:24,060
I mean, if you wanted to get her car
away from the front of the house...

452
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:26,900
...why go to all the hassle
of taking it down to the station?

453
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,580
You see, the trick in magic...

454
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:32,620
...is to do the one thing
so simple and so obvious...

455
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,940
...that no one ever thinks of it.

456
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:40,220
You see? What’s simpler than putting
the car back where it came from?

457
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:43,140
Did anyone see you
take her car back to her office?

458
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,940
Jesus, you think I wanna get busted...

459
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:48,420
...for ripping off old lady Hallet’s
most prized possession?

460
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:52,820
You know, you don’t even trust me
enough to tell me why I did it.

461
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,700
You did it to help me.

462
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:59,540
Did you lock her car doors?

463
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,420
You should’ve put them
through her office mailbox.

464
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,540
No, I shouldn’t. Let me tell you.

465
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:08,020
I’m sitting there in her Bentley
in the dark, right...

466
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:11,140
...in front of her goddamn office,
trying not to let anybody see me...

467
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:12,580
...and ask me what I’m doing.

468
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,180
I gotta be careful, right?

469
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:17,780
Now, I may not know why Mrs. Hallet
didn’t drive her own car back...

470
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:19,820
...but one thing I do know:

471
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,820
Why would Mrs. Hallet
put her own keys...

472
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:24,260
...through her own goddamn
office mailbox?

473
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:28,580
She wouldn’t. She’d keep her keys.
They’d be wherever she is.

474
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:30,860
I feel like some wine.

475
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:35,940
Hey, now, this is pretty fancy.
Doesn’t even unscrew.

476
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:38,940
It’s got a cork and everything.
Now, this is class.

477
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:42,020
You still didn’t tell me why. How come
she didn’t drive her car back?

478
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,900
- So, what do you care?
- I risked my goddamn ass for you.

479
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,060
You didn’t have to.

480
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:48,620
Look, you better tell me
what the hell is going on...

481
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:51,780
...because if I'd left that car
down at the station like you told me...

482
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:54,140
...everybody in the village
would’ve recognized it.

483
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,300
You don’t trust anybody, do you?

484
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:02,500
- You want another lamb chop?
- Shouldn’t we save it for your father?

485
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,460
He’s staying overnight in New York.

486
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,860
Hey, you never said that.

487
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:10,420
- Have you ever stayed alone before?
- Sure, hundreds of times.

488
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:12,260
Like all those times
you smoked hash?

489
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,780
- Aren’t you scared?
- Of what?

490
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,540
- Of being alone.
- No.

491
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,740
You know, last week on TV
I saw this old woman...

492
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:23,580
...who was strangled
with a body stocking.

493
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,660
I mean, it can happen.

494
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,460
You know you got an outside light?

495
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:37,820
- Leave it on all the time, okay?
- Thanks.

496
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:40,500
You know, with me,
you got an indoor light.

497
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,500
Hey, that’s neat.

498
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:45,860
Well, Mr. Show Biz, that’s me.

499
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,860
You need more of an audience.

500
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,100
I’d like you to meet Gordon.

501
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,620
Gordon.

502
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,620
Isn’t he cute?

503
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,900
- Hey, hi, Gordon.
- Get away.

504
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,700
You don’t even trust me
with your rat.

505
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,460
- It’s a hamster.
- It looks like a rat.

506
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,860
- You look like a rat.
- No.

507
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,460
- Come here.
- You got any pets?

508
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:11,340
No, just my parents,
which I water and feed regularly.

509
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,780
How nice.

510
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:15,060
I think we gotta get Gordon
back to the cage.

511
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:17,180
L"II make a deal with you.

512
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,780
You tell me about the car,
I’ll tell you why I’m crippled.

513
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,220
No.

514
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,820
It was polio shots.

515
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:24,820
See, I have so many
brothers and sisters...

516
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:28,380
...that my mother forgot
who did and who didn’t.

517
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:31,900
Okay, now I wanna know
about the car. All of it.

518
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,220
We have some peach ice cream.
Would you like some?

519
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,780
No.

520
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,700
- The car.
- Her car?

521
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:41,180
Did you leave any fingerprints?

522
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:46,020
Presto! No fingerprints.

523
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,100
You’re so magic,
let’s see you do a trick.

524
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:50,340
- Okay. Hold on to my cane.
- I want a trick!

525
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,900
- Hold on to my cane.
- All right.

526
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:56,100
Ladies and gentlemen, I shall now
make an automobile disappear.

527
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:59,740
- You already did that.
- Well, then, behold, I shall disappear.

528
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,620
Now, go hide your eyes
in the corner and don’t peek.

529
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:05,380
Okay, you ready? Now, don’t peek.
Don’t peek, Gordon.

530
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:11,260
Here we go. One, two, three.

531
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,260
Ready or not, here I come.

532
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,780
Mario?

533
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:23,140
Hey, Mario?

534
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,460
Mario?

535
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,980
Give me that!

536
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:47,340
Well, Mary-fucking-Poppins.

537
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:50,380
- Give me that!
- Come and get it.

538
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,180
Give it!

539
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:55,100
Mario.

540
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:58,500
Mario, I mean it. Now, stop.

541
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,260
Mario.

542
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,380
Listen.

543
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:12,660
Somebody’s out there. Okay.

544
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,540
Hey, it’s a police car.

545
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:25,020
Hey, don’t worry. It’s my uncle Ron.

546
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,060
- Hi.
- Hi. Come on in.

547
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,940
Would you like a glass of wine?

548
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,020
Yeah, it’s okay. You’re off duty.

549
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,500
Hey, so, what’s happening, unc?

550
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,420
I mean, where’s your
Playmate of the Week?

551
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:40,020
She’s waiting outside in the car.

552
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:42,660
You know, he likes the ones
who look like they were...

553
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:45,420
...blown up with a bicycle pump,
you know?

554
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:48,940
What, are you gonna bust us
for drinking here? I won’t have it.

555
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:51,460
You’re just lucky
I don’t smell any grass.

556
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,020
You got any? L"II buy it cheap.

557
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,980
No respect. No respect for the law.

558
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:57,220
Respect? You want respect?

559
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:00,380
He wants respect, and he’s using
his police car to get all his action.

560
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:02,420
Just the two of you, huh?

561
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,740
My father’s sleeping.

562
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:07,900
- You met her father?
- Oh, yeah, nice guy.

563
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,380
He had dinner with you, huh?

564
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:12,140
Hey, how many plates you see here?
I count two. One...

565
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,220
Yeah, okay, okay, wise guy.
All right.

566
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:17,060
He was tired,
so he went upstairs to bed.

567
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:21,980
Candlelight, wine and a fireplace.

568
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:24,380
It’s really very romantic.

569
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,940
Frank Hallet called in twice.

570
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:32,300
- He said his mother’s missing.
- She’s probably out house-pimping.

571
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:34,180
Mario don’t like the Hallets.

572
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:36,820
Me? I don’t think you like them
too much either.

573
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,780
I remember he tried
to get Hallet busted...

574
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:41,020
...for dragging some little girl
into the bushes.

575
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,300
He couldn’t do it, though.

576
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:44,580
All Hallet’s mother did
was marry the creep off...

577
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:46,900
...to some waitress with two kids.
- That’s enough.

578
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:49,820
- To prove he was normal.
- Don’t be such a smart-ass.

579
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:53,220
Anyway, her car’s in front
of the office, but no sign of her.

580
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:55,300
And Hallet said he was
coming over here...

581
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:58,500
...to pick up some jelly glasses
or something like that.

582
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:04,220
Yeah, well, you see,
they’re still here waiting for her.

583
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:07,460
- No one’s touched them.
- So she never came by, huh?

584
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:11,140
- No.
- So you came looking for her here?

585
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:13,820
I came here because I thought
that Rynn might be alone.

586
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:16,860
Did you think that fink would be
waiting here for you to catch him?

587
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:19,820
Look, if you don’t want your mom
and dad to know you were here...

588
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:22,500
...don’t be such a smart-ass.
- Who’s a smart-ass?

589
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:25,020
Why don’t you teach him
some manners.

590
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:28,900
Oh, if Mrs. Hallet comes by, could
you have her call the police station?

591
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,700
- Okay?
- Fine.

592
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,940
- Thanks for the wine.
- Good night.

593
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,900
And don’t do anything I wouldn’t do.

594
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,900
- I mean, that was scary, wasn’t it?
- Yeah.

595
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:48,740
Wasn’t it? How’d you like the way
I made your father disappear?

596
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:51,620
- You lied.
- You bet your ass.

597
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:54,020
What did you want me
to do anyway?

598
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:57,700
Well, where do you think
you’re going?

599
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:58,980
Just testing.

600
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:02,300
Like, you don’t really want me to go
or anything, do you? Do you, huh?

601
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:03,940
- No.
- Oh, you got feelings, huh?

602
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:06,260
I thought you were
a piece of cardboard. Come.

603
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:08,060
Come on.

604
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:13,100
Are you crazy?

605
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:19,060
He’s back. Come on.
Go ahead, answer the door.

606
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,300
- You ready?
- Yeah, go ahead.

607
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:25,700
Hello.

608
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,180
May I come in?

609
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:34,500
I think it’s time you and I
had a little talk, don’t you agree?

610
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:41,340
Are these the famous jelly jars?

611
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:44,860
Hello.

612
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:48,540
Only two for dinner?

613
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:54,100
Did your father quit smoking, Rynn?

614
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:55,940
Give us a light, son.

615
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:17,380
It’s cold in here. Let’s put
some more wood on the fire.

616
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:19,140
L"II get it.

617
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:27,780
Hello, Gordon.

618
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:42,420
Where’s your father, Rynn?

619
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:49,380
Do you love Gordon?

620
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:51,500
Yes.

621
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:54,700
Yes, what?

622
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,340
Yes, I love Gordon.

623
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:01,540
And I think Gordon loves you too.

624
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:13,100
No!

625
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:15,260
Hey, what are you? A maniac?

626
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:30,500
The son of a bitch bit me.

627
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,340
Give me some disinfectant.

628
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:38,060
It’s upstairs in the medicine cabinet.

629
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:42,940
Now, listen to me, young lady.

630
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:45,020
I know you’re up to something.

631
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:47,820
And I wanna know
where your father is.

632
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:53,180
What'll you tell me this time?
He’s working? Or sleeping?

633
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:55,300
Did he have dinner here?

634
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:58,500
- Did you have dinner here, son?
- Yep.

635
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:00,860
Just you and pretty Rynn?

636
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:02,860
Yep.

637
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:05,740
- And where’s he?
- Who?

638
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:08,900
- Who are we talking about?
- Oh, her father’s sleeping.

639
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:11,140
- Upstairs?
- Upstairs.

640
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:12,900
- You were gonna say in the study.
- No.

641
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:15,700
- Don’t lie to me, damn it. You were.
- No, I wasn’t.

642
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:18,820
- Who is he?
- I’m Mario Podesta.

643
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:21,860
- I asked you. Who is he?
- He’s Mario Podesta.

644
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:25,380
Oh, yes. I think I’ve seen you hobbling
around the village, haven’t I?

645
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:26,820
- My uncle’s a cop.
- Really?

646
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:28,740
He was just here.

647
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:31,260
- Why was he here?
- And he’s coming back.

648
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:33,740
- That’s not what I asked you.
- Tell him.

649
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,740
Yes, tell me.

650
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:39,260
He said you called about your mother.
Said you might come looking for her.

651
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:40,820
Why would my dear mother be here?

652
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:42,940
Unless she ran off
with the man of the house...

653
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:44,580
...which has happened on occasion.

654
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:46,980
- She’s not here.
- No, it was about the jelly glasses.

655
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:49,580
The other day you said
you didn’t have any boyfriends.

656
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:50,700
Yes.

657
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:53,060
- Are you her boyfriend?
- Yes.

658
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:56,660
You told me no boyfriends.

659
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:59,180
She’s very young.
Did she tell you how old she was?

660
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:02,020
- Thirteen.
- Don’t you know any girls your age?

661
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:04,900
Or do girls your age like to dance?

662
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:07,780
- The jelly glasses.
- What about them?

663
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:10,820
- You can take them now.
- Not now.

664
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:13,060
Perhaps Mother came by
but you weren’t home.

665
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:14,940
I was here all the time.

666
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:17,860
- Didn’t you go to the football game?
- I couldn’t have missed her.

667
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:20,420
So you say you’ve
been here all along?

668
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:22,700
- Yeah.
- That’s very strange.

669
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:24,260
You can take the glasses now.

670
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:26,020
- L"II put them in your car.
- Will you?

671
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:28,060
- Yeah, I’ll do it right now.
- No, you can’t.

672
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:29,540
No car.

673
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:32,580
See, I walked here tonight,
as my dear wife has the station wagon.

674
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:35,460
As for the Bentley,
dear Mother has the keys.

675
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:37,180
What do you want, Mr. Hallet?

676
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:41,060
- What do you want, son?
- What do you mean?

677
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:43,980
You want what all boyfriends want.
You don’t like girls?

678
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:45,980
- Yes, I like girls.
- You don’t want Rynn?

679
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:50,300
Be a good little magician,
will you, son?

680
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:52,620
Disappear yourself.
Tell him to get out of here.

681
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:54,940
- He’s my friend.
- But not your boyfriend.

682
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:58,340
First, I shall tell you what I want.

683
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:01,860
I wanna know what’s been
happening here in this house.

684
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:04,460
I wanna know
what happened here today!

685
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:07,260
Nothing happened.

686
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:09,700
All day is a long time
for nothing to happen.

687
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:11,340
Just now the police were here.

688
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:14,500
Yes or no? That happened, didn’t it?

689
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:17,060
The police were here, yes or no?

690
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:21,620
Officer Miglioriti came to say
you were looking for your mother.

691
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:23,260
Go on.

692
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:26,060
- There are the jelly glasses.
- Meaning what?

693
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:29,060
- Meaning she hasn’t been here.
- That doesn’t prove anything.

694
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:32,980
- I guess I can’t help you, can I?
- Do you wanna help me?

695
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:36,580
- Do you wanna help me, son?
- Sure.

696
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:39,340
Then get your ass
the hell out of here right now.

697
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,100
Hey, Rynn, call the cops.

698
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:43,740
Be my guest.

699
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:57,860
What’s the matter, gimp?
Got trouble staying on your feet?

700
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:06,860
I didn’t think you’d call.

701
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:08,900
Hit the road, wop.

702
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:11,860
- We’ll both go.
- No, just you and your goddamn cape.

703
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:13,780
Get out of here.

704
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:26,020
I’m a wop.
Wops carry knives, right?

705
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:30,340
Guinea. Dago. Wop.

706
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:33,100
Easy, son. Easy.
I take it back. I take it all back.

707
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:36,100
What do they call guys like you
who hang around little girls?

708
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:37,820
A pervert?

709
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:41,220
You know, if I stick this in your guts,
all the cops will do is thank me.

710
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:44,900
Now, I think you’d better get
the hell out of here.

711
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:46,660
Get out of here!

712
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:55,940
- Call the cops.
- No.

713
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:58,580
Little son of a bitch.

714
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:02,700
I’m not through with you,
that’s for damn sure.

715
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:19,220
Is it hers?

716
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:21,220
Yeah.

717
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:33,260
Come on.

718
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:37,300
Oh, boy.

719
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:39,820
That’s trouble.

720
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:42,860
I mean, how did...?

721
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:46,300
Why don’t you take the cookies in
where the tea will be.

722
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:49,060
Mario?

723
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:53,340
Rynn, how long has it been
for your mother?

724
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:58,220
October 17th.

725
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:02,980
I don’t understand.
I mean, don’t bodies...?

726
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:05,180
- Decompose?
- Yeah.

727
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:06,900
Well, you can put stuff on them.

728
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:09,740
So why don’t you take
the tray in next to the fire, all right?

729
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,340
Yeah.

730
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:13,580
How do you know
how to do that stuff?

731
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:16,500
I looked it up in the library.

732
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:23,140
In London we found out
my father was dying.

733
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:24,780
My mother had run away
when I was 3.

734
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:27,820
He didn’t want her to get her
red fingernails into me ever again.

735
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:29,700
We left England
without a word to anyone.

736
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:33,820
It was the end of the summer
when I came here...

737
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:35,980
...and I knew this was the place.

738
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:38,380
But he said I should think
it over for a week...

739
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:42,260
...to make sure I wanted to spend
the next three years of my life here.

740
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:45,100
The rent’s paid up
for the next three years.

741
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:48,180
So three more years like this?

742
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:56,460
Almost all September,
he looked fine.

743
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:00,940
If the pain was terrible,
he never said anything.

744
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:05,020
Then one Sunday evening...

745
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:07,940
...we were sitting in this room...

746
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:12,100
...and he whispered to me
in a very soft voice...

747
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:16,500
...that I wasn’t like
anybody else in the world...

748
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:19,940
...that people
wouldn’t understand me.

749
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:22,380
They’d order me around,
tell me what to do...

750
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:25,740
...and try to make me into the person
they wanted me to be.

751
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:31,100
Since I was only a kid,
I couldn’t say anything.

752
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:34,700
I’d have to stay alone...

753
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:38,820
...keep out of trouble and make
myself very small in the world.

754
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:41,580
All alone?

755
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:44,860
We worked out every detail.

756
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:46,900
We knew it wouldn’t be easy.

757
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:52,420
Here’s a letter from my father.

758
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:56,420
"Don’t give in and play their game.

759
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:58,860
Fight them any way you have to.

760
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:00,860
Survive."

761
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:03,140
That’s what he said.

762
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:06,660
Then he kissed me...

763
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:09,660
...and walked off into the trees
and down the lane.

764
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:13,300
In that room, I found charts
of tide tables and waters...

765
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:15,740
...in the sound and the ocean.

766
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:20,540
He'll never be found.

767
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:24,420
Did you cry a lot?

768
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:27,700
Depends what you mean by a lot.

769
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:32,500
No. I guess not very much.

770
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:34,940
Do you believe in God?

771
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:38,020
- It’d be nice.
- But you don’t.

772
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:39,900
I don’t know.

773
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,940
You know, it’s all so goddamn wild.

774
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:44,100
I mean...

775
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:46,980
...there’s so many problems.

776
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:50,060
- How do you pay for stuff?
- Traveler’s checks.

777
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:52,420
Yeah, kids can have them too.

778
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:56,420
I keep them in a safe-deposit box
in the bank.

779
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:59,140
I have to make them last
for three years.

780
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:03,740
- How’d your mother find you?
- By lying to my father’s publisher.

781
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:07,500
She walked right in.
Fingernails as red as ever.

782
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:10,180
My God, the nerve of her.

783
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:14,820
She sat right over there.
Smoked her gold-tipped cigarettes...

784
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:18,060
...went on and on about the
pollution in the Mediterranean...

785
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:20,620
...and how marvelous it would be
to stay here.

786
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:24,940
I hated myself for doing it,
but I actually acted happy to see her.

787
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:30,740
She asked me for a drink, but I lied
and told her we didn’t have any.

788
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:34,220
I gave her some tea
with the same almond biscuits.

789
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:35,660
They’re very good.

790
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:40,180
My father had given me a small bottle
containing some white powder.

791
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:44,780
He said if she should arrive,
I should put it in her tea.

792
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:47,100
It would calm her,
make her less aggressive.

793
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:49,060
Well, it sure did.

794
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:50,820
But you didn’t know
what it was, huh?

795
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:52,500
No, not until after.

796
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:54,820
I looked it up
based on its properties.

797
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:57,420
- Potassium cyanide.
- And that’s what you put in her tea?

798
00:54:57,580 --> 00:55:00,620
Father meant what he said about
doing anything you have to to survive.

799
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:05,660
How come you’re not
drinking yours?

800
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:10,860
Mine’s still too hot.
I didn’t put in any cold milk.

801
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:14,380
I can still see her red nails
holding up that cup.

802
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:18,060
After a few sips, she said
that the tea tasted of almonds.

803
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:21,500
"It’s the almond cookies," I told her.

804
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:25,540
"They come from Fortnum’s."
She loved that.

805
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:29,580
- How long did it take?
- Quite fast, actually.

806
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:33,380
You mean, like,
first you can’t breathe?

807
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:36,100
Yeah. Apparently.

808
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:41,700
What’s wrong with you?
You okay?

809
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:49,500
Yeah, now I’m okay.

810
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:53,220
I’m all right.

811
00:55:58,220 --> 00:55:59,900
Listen.

812
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:06,540
It’s just the wind.
Sounds like it’s alive.

813
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:09,220
Look, about the telephone.

814
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:11,260
We better not call each other
from now on...

815
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:13,460
...because somebody
might be listening, okay?

816
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:15,020
Okay.

817
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:14,980
Let’s go.

818
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:18,620
I’m not gonna play their game.

819
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:21,100
Would that be so awful?

820
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:22,700
The game is pretending, you know?

821
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:26,100
It’s like going through the motions
of living without really living.

822
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:27,700
But what about school?

823
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:29,900
School is having people
tell you what life is...

824
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:31,660
...and never finding out by yourself.

825
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:33,820
Yeah, but kids have to go to school.

826
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:35,220
Why?

827
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:36,940
Okay, so your father taught you.

828
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:38,980
Everybody doesn’t have
a father like yours.

829
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:41,340
Everybody can’t be like you.

830
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:43,940
If I’d listened to them,
I’d be like them.

831
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:47,620
Damn. You keep saying "them"
like everyone’s out to get you.

832
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:49,500
Maybe they are.

833
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:51,300
Well, you gotta trust somebody.

834
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:04,540
Mario!

835
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:07,820
Come on.

836
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:11,500
Mario.

837
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:15,940
Come on, Mario. Mario!

838
01:01:20,540 --> 01:01:22,380
You all right?

839
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:26,220
I’ve got a tub waiting
for you upstairs.

840
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:50,540
Hello?

841
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:54,020
Mr. Hallet?

842
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:55,820
Mr. Hallet, I know this is you...

843
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:59,260
...because everybody else is at
the football game this afternoon.

844
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:02,540
I should warn you that the police
are watching our house...

845
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:04,980
...right this very minute, Mr. Hallet.

846
01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:15,500
I found a pair of
your father’s pajamas.

847
01:02:15,820 --> 01:02:17,580
It’s a pretty good fit.

848
01:02:17,740 --> 01:02:20,460
Come on, you’re shivering.
Sit down.

849
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:24,460
- Who called?
- No one.

850
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:26,460
Rynn, who called?

851
01:02:26,620 --> 01:02:28,980
Well, whoever called
didn’t leave their name.

852
01:02:29,140 --> 01:02:30,860
Was it Hallet?

853
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:34,300
- Yeah.
- That creep.

854
01:02:35,140 --> 01:02:37,180
You’re like ice.

855
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:39,060
Come on.

856
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:55,260
- Is that better?
- Yeah.

857
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:01,500
It’s dark already.

858
01:03:06,220 --> 01:03:07,780
Mario...

859
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:12,580
...if you want,
I can get into bed with you.

860
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:30,700
- Is that better?
- Yeah.

861
01:03:34,180 --> 01:03:35,820
Mario?

862
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:39,660
I know what you’re gonna ask.

863
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:42,580
Have you ever?

864
01:03:43,540 --> 01:03:45,540
Hundreds of times.

865
01:03:50,020 --> 01:03:52,380
Do they expect you
home for dinner?

866
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:54,860
Would it be so terrible
if you didn’t go?

867
01:03:55,020 --> 01:03:58,060
I mean, if your parents did
find out about us?

868
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:00,900
Your uncle Ron knows.

869
01:04:01,460 --> 01:04:05,260
Look, Rynn, they’d wanna
know all about you.

870
01:04:05,420 --> 01:04:07,660
Every goddamn thing.

871
01:04:09,580 --> 01:04:12,500
And I’m not as good
at lying as you are.

872
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:20,460
Here, take this. It’s my father’s.

873
01:04:22,820 --> 01:04:25,460
Like your father said in that letter:

874
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:30,060
Since when do they let kids
do what they want?

875
01:04:43,740 --> 01:04:47,380
- Come back after dinner?
- L"II try.

876
01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:53,940
- Who is it?
- Ron Miglioriti.

877
01:05:57,900 --> 01:06:00,860
Hi. I’m just making
my Saturday-night call.

878
01:06:01,020 --> 01:06:02,500
Yeah, come on in.

879
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:04,740
- You all right?
- Fine.

880
01:06:04,940 --> 01:06:07,980
- How are you?
- Fine, fine, thanks.

881
01:06:08,140 --> 01:06:10,700
- Can I get you anything...?
- No, no. I can’t stay, really.

882
01:06:10,860 --> 01:06:13,460
Your pumped-up lady
waiting for you?

883
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:16,900
Sorry. Does make me sound
like a smart-ass, doesn’t it?

884
01:06:19,180 --> 01:06:22,060
- You’re all alone, huh?
- My father’s here.

885
01:06:22,220 --> 01:06:26,060
Rynn, I don’t believe what you’ve been
telling me about your father.

886
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:27,580
No?

887
01:06:27,740 --> 01:06:30,660
No, no, you’re gonna tell me
that he’s in there working, right?

888
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:33,020
He was this afternoon. Translating.

889
01:06:33,180 --> 01:06:35,340
Then he was, and now he isn’t?
That’s it, huh?

890
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:36,940
No, he’s resting upstairs.

891
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:39,300
I’ve been here three times.

892
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:42,580
And each time I notice
how good you are with words.

893
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:45,860
The way you speak,
you’re very careful.

894
01:06:46,020 --> 01:06:47,460
You’re too goddamn careful.

895
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:50,740
- You don’t believe he’s upstairs, then?
- No.

896
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:52,740
All right.

897
01:06:53,780 --> 01:06:55,340
Father!

898
01:06:57,820 --> 01:06:59,460
Father?

899
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:03,860
- He should be down in a minute.
- Yeah, sure.

900
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:08,460
Look, I understand, because I haven’t
been telling you the truth all the time.

901
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:11,980
Because my father isn’t a well man.

902
01:07:12,620 --> 01:07:14,220
Maybe you don’t understand
about poets.

903
01:07:14,380 --> 01:07:18,500
Edgar Allen Poe was a drug addict.
Dylan Thomas drank himself to death.

904
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:19,980
Sylvia Plath took her own life.

905
01:07:20,140 --> 01:07:22,220
Rynn, we’re talking about your father.

906
01:07:22,860 --> 01:07:24,620
Yeah, well...

907
01:07:26,140 --> 01:07:30,860
Sometimes my father goes
into his room and locks the door.

908
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:32,740
He keeps something
in a desk drawer.

909
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:34,780
I don’t know what it is.

910
01:07:36,020 --> 01:07:37,700
But I know...

911
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:40,460
...when he locks that door...

912
01:07:41,420 --> 01:07:44,740
...he doesn’t want me to see
the way he becomes, you know?

913
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:46,860
That may sound stupid,
but you don’t know my...

914
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:48,100
Yes, Rynn, what is it?

915
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:53,740
Father, I’d like you to meet
Officer Miglioriti.

916
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:56,740
- You know, the one I told you about.
- Good evening, sir.

917
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:59,460
- Sorry to bother you.
- Yes, quite all right. Quite all right.

918
01:07:59,660 --> 01:08:01,220
I’m the one to apologize.

919
01:08:01,420 --> 01:08:02,820
I confess to being a bit tired.

920
01:08:03,020 --> 01:08:04,900
So how can my daughter
and I help you?

921
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:06,980
No, no problem, no problem.

922
01:08:07,180 --> 01:08:09,940
Rynn, nip into my study,
get one of my books, will you?

923
01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:11,860
And a pen, please.

924
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:15,180
Rynn tells me we’ve promised you
an autographed copy.

925
01:08:16,940 --> 01:08:19,660
If you’d be good enough
to spell Miglioriti.

926
01:08:19,820 --> 01:08:21,220
"Ron" will be okay.

927
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:23,180
Yes, Ron, okay. Here.

928
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:26,860
Ron, from Lester.

929
01:08:29,740 --> 01:08:32,060
Well, it’s really been nice
to meet you, sir.

930
01:08:32,220 --> 01:08:35,020
Yes, it’s a pleasure. Good night.

931
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:36,820
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

932
01:08:36,980 --> 01:08:39,340
- See you later, Rynn.
- Good night.

933
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:45,700
Guess I owe you an apology, huh?

934
01:08:45,860 --> 01:08:47,820
That’s all right. Don’t worry about it.

935
01:08:49,820 --> 01:08:53,060
- Good night.
- I hope you enjoy the book.

936
01:08:53,220 --> 01:08:54,780
Thanks.

937
01:09:14,460 --> 01:09:18,100
You were great.
Your voice was so deep.

938
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:20,420
Yeah.

939
01:09:24,140 --> 01:09:27,020
Yeah, it’s this damn cold.

940
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:33,180
How do you spell Miglioriti?

941
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:37,300
How would I have known
if you hadn’t come back?

942
01:09:37,460 --> 01:09:40,420
- I would have come back anyway.
- I hoped you would.

943
01:09:40,860 --> 01:09:44,140
Remember? You said
I don’t trust anybody.

944
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:50,180
You know, we should have told
Uncle Ron what he was interrupting.

945
01:09:50,380 --> 01:09:52,700
A gentleman never tells.

946
01:09:52,860 --> 01:09:55,180
Well, maybe in England they don’t...

947
01:09:55,340 --> 01:09:57,780
...but here they never
shut up about it.

948
01:09:58,180 --> 01:10:01,220
L"II bet half... Well, hell,
most of the football team...

949
01:10:01,420 --> 01:10:03,740
...that’s all they ever do,
is talk about it.

950
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:08,100
You know, I won’t tell anybody.

951
01:10:09,020 --> 01:10:10,700
You know, we have
to trust each other...

952
01:10:10,860 --> 01:10:13,460
...because most people don’t
go through as much as we have.

953
01:10:13,620 --> 01:10:16,340
Not even in a whole entire lifetime.

954
01:10:18,060 --> 01:10:20,020
No one will know about us.

955
01:10:20,180 --> 01:10:22,740
I never knew how much
I needed you.

956
01:10:23,220 --> 01:10:24,860
Ever think maybe
I’m playing your game?

957
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:26,460
Because you want to?

958
01:10:26,620 --> 01:10:29,060
No. Because I love you.

959
01:10:35,020 --> 01:10:36,820
Thank you.

960
01:10:39,420 --> 01:10:42,220
- You’re gonna catch my cold.
- I don’t care.

961
01:10:45,180 --> 01:10:48,780
You know, when I told you
I didn’t mind being alone, I lied.

962
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:51,500
Don’t ever leave, okay?

963
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:18,060
With all this snow,
it’s a good time to see...

964
01:11:18,220 --> 01:11:20,260
...if you and your father
have had any visitors.

965
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:24,220
I love detective stories.
Do you read Agatha Christie?

966
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:26,020
All her murder mysteries
take place...

967
01:11:26,180 --> 01:11:28,380
...in the most beautiful
old English country houses.

968
01:11:28,540 --> 01:11:30,020
See these?

969
01:11:30,380 --> 01:11:32,540
Footprints. They’re mine
and my father’s, I expect.

970
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:34,580
They’re not very clear.

971
01:11:34,740 --> 01:11:36,900
As long as you’re here,
you wanna give me a hand?

972
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:39,740
You know, I can’t
figure you out at all.

973
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:42,580
You haven’t even asked me
about Mario.

974
01:11:44,740 --> 01:11:47,420
- What about him?
- He’s in the hospital.

975
01:11:47,740 --> 01:11:49,180
Pneumonia.

976
01:11:50,980 --> 01:11:52,100
How bad?

977
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:54,540
Well, without the antibiotics,
he would’ve died.

978
01:11:57,260 --> 01:11:59,100
I’ve gotta see him.
I’ve gotta see him.

979
01:11:59,260 --> 01:12:01,060
Can you go now?

980
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:10,100
- You’ve seen him?
- Yeah.

981
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:12,780
He was delirious
and talking out loud.

982
01:12:12,940 --> 01:12:14,460
About the two of you.

983
01:12:14,620 --> 01:12:15,780
Yes?

984
01:12:16,180 --> 01:12:17,420
Saying how much he loves you.

985
01:12:59,180 --> 01:13:00,740
Mario.

986
01:13:02,660 --> 01:13:04,140
Mario?

987
01:13:09,580 --> 01:13:11,420
Mario, I love you.

988
01:13:15,060 --> 01:13:17,340
My father worked it all out.

989
01:13:20,380 --> 01:13:22,060
How I’d live.

990
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:25,540
What I’d do.

991
01:13:28,780 --> 01:13:31,140
But it can’t work.

992
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:36,180
It can’t work without you.

993
01:13:39,820 --> 01:13:41,540
He was wrong.

994
01:17:28,940 --> 01:17:30,060
No...

995
01:17:36,420 --> 01:17:38,060
Oh, Mario.

996
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:41,940
Anything for a trick.
You weren’t sick at all.

997
01:17:43,740 --> 01:17:46,340
- Get out of here!
- Trick or treat.

998
01:17:46,540 --> 01:17:49,180
Mr. Hallet, if you leave right now,
I won’t say a word, okay?

999
01:17:49,340 --> 01:17:53,860
Call the police? No?
Why don’t you call your father.

1000
01:17:55,660 --> 01:17:59,540
The least you could do is offer me
a cup of tea after I got all dressed up.

1001
01:18:02,540 --> 01:18:03,500
If anybody came by...

1002
01:18:03,660 --> 01:18:06,860
...naturally they’d assume I was
your little friend, don’t you think?

1003
01:18:07,460 --> 01:18:08,900
I even limped.

1004
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:10,780
Officer Miglioriti's
gonna be coming by.

1005
01:18:10,940 --> 01:18:14,700
Officer Miglioriti is at his stupid raffle.

1006
01:18:15,380 --> 01:18:17,580
It’s awful dirty down there
in the cellar.

1007
01:18:17,740 --> 01:18:19,980
I had no idea what I’d find.

1008
01:18:20,140 --> 01:18:23,100
Certainly not those damn jelly jars.

1009
01:18:24,780 --> 01:18:27,380
L"II show you what I did find,
if you’re interested.

1010
01:18:29,420 --> 01:18:30,500
A hairpin.

1011
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:33,180
Not yours, though. No.

1012
01:18:33,340 --> 01:18:36,620
You wouldn’t wear pins
in that pretty hair.

1013
01:18:37,060 --> 01:18:39,780
- Could’ve been down there for years.
- No, it would’ve rusted.

1014
01:18:39,940 --> 01:18:42,500
Besides, it still smells
of the perfume...

1015
01:18:42,700 --> 01:18:45,220
...I gave my mother
for Christmas last year.

1016
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:47,140
One more thing.

1017
01:18:47,980 --> 01:18:51,580
A bright-red broken fingernail,
wouldn’t you say?

1018
01:18:52,220 --> 01:18:54,340
I wonder who that belongs to.

1019
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:56,980
Not my mother’s color at all.

1020
01:18:58,140 --> 01:19:02,020
No telling what the police
could come up with down there.

1021
01:19:02,220 --> 01:19:04,180
Or out in the garden.

1022
01:19:06,220 --> 01:19:07,620
At least I should thank you...

1023
01:19:07,820 --> 01:19:11,300
...for bringing the Bentley
back to the office, though.

1024
01:19:12,420 --> 01:19:15,180
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.

1025
01:19:16,260 --> 01:19:18,220
Had to call a locksmith.

1026
01:19:19,820 --> 01:19:22,260
Any idea where the keys might be?

1027
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:26,380
Perhaps on that chain
around your pretty neck.

1028
01:19:29,700 --> 01:19:33,140
- Where are you going?
- You said you wanted some tea.

1029
01:19:35,620 --> 01:19:38,860
There are some details
still to be worked out, of course.

1030
01:19:39,020 --> 01:19:40,300
Not to worry.

1031
01:19:41,180 --> 01:19:45,180
L"II enjoy figuring them out
on our long winter nights together.

1032
01:19:57,780 --> 01:19:59,180
Hello?

1033
01:19:59,620 --> 01:20:04,220
Officer Miglioriti.
What? Oh, really?

1034
01:20:04,380 --> 01:20:05,900
That’s great.

1035
01:20:08,420 --> 01:20:10,220
No, no, not now.

1036
01:20:10,940 --> 01:20:12,380
L"II manage.

1037
01:20:12,980 --> 01:20:15,860
Okay, thanks. Bye.

1038
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:20,420
Rule number one: No secrets.

1039
01:20:20,580 --> 01:20:23,260
I won the stupid
Thanksgiving turkey.

1040
01:20:23,420 --> 01:20:24,540
Congratulations.

1041
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:27,620
And you told him not to bring it by.
Very wise.

1042
01:20:37,580 --> 01:20:39,340
You know...

1043
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:43,380
...there’s no reason you shouldn’t go
right on living the way you have been.

1044
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:48,460
Only now, of course,
we’ll be friends, you and I.

1045
01:20:51,660 --> 01:20:53,700
Just us two, huh?

1046
01:21:06,540 --> 01:21:09,380
We could become
very good friends.

1047
01:21:14,260 --> 01:21:17,100
I like the way you handled yourself
on the phone.

1048
01:21:17,620 --> 01:21:19,420
You are brilliant.

1049
01:21:19,900 --> 01:21:22,060
You’re inventive and resourceful...

1050
01:21:22,220 --> 01:21:24,100
...very cool under fire.

1051
01:21:24,260 --> 01:21:25,780
You know how to survive, don’t you?

1052
01:21:25,940 --> 01:21:27,900
I thought I did.

1053
01:21:49,140 --> 01:21:50,860
What about Mario?

1054
01:21:51,020 --> 01:21:54,340
- He’s in the hospital.
- He knows. Everything.

1055
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:56,300
- Maybe he'll die.
- The doctor says no.

1056
01:21:56,460 --> 01:22:00,140
It really doesn’t matter, you know.
He’s an accomplice.

1057
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:03,180
- Mr. Hallet?
- Yes, my dear?

1058
01:22:03,340 --> 01:22:05,420
Will you tell your wife?

1059
01:22:05,580 --> 01:22:06,900
What?

1060
01:22:07,060 --> 01:22:09,060
Will you tell your wife?

1061
01:22:11,140 --> 01:22:14,540
Well, suppose you let me
take care of that, okay?

1062
01:22:15,860 --> 01:22:17,540
The fire’s catching.

1063
01:22:17,700 --> 01:22:19,780
It’s nice and cozy now, huh?

1064
01:22:19,980 --> 01:22:23,500
- What are we listening to?
- Chopin. Piano Concerto No. 1.

1065
01:22:23,660 --> 01:22:25,260
Yes.

1066
01:22:25,740 --> 01:22:27,100
It’s lovely.

1067
01:22:28,140 --> 01:22:31,100
- You want milk?
- Yes, please.

1068
01:22:33,300 --> 01:22:34,620
Thank you.

1069
01:22:36,860 --> 01:22:39,820
- Would you like some sugar?
- Just one, please.

1070
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:43,020
L"II expect you to remember that.

1071
01:22:43,180 --> 01:22:46,060
That’s easy. It’s the same as I take.

1072
01:22:49,740 --> 01:22:52,140
Nothing like a nice
hot cup of tea, is there?

1073
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:53,660
No.

1074
01:23:04,700 --> 01:23:07,860
- Something wrong, my dear?
- No.

1075
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:10,740
Why aren’t you drinking your tea?

1076
01:23:10,940 --> 01:23:13,260
I’m waiting for you. You’re the guest.

1077
01:23:15,340 --> 01:23:17,540
You put more milk in yours.

1078
01:23:17,700 --> 01:23:19,060
Did I?

1079
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:22,100
Actually, that’s the way
I prefer mine.

1080
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:28,620
I’d prefer yours.

1081
01:23:30,180 --> 01:23:32,460
Look at me when I talk to you.

1082
01:23:32,860 --> 01:23:34,780
I want yours.

1083
01:23:42,700 --> 01:23:45,860
Gives us more a feeling of sharing,
don’t you agree?

1084
01:23:51,140 --> 01:23:52,940
Ladies first.

1085
01:23:55,180 --> 01:23:56,580
No, wait.

1086
01:24:02,900 --> 01:24:04,300
Is it good?

1087
01:24:14,860 --> 01:24:16,580
Just right.

1088
01:24:18,260 --> 01:24:19,980
You know why I switched cups,
don’t you?

1089
01:24:20,140 --> 01:24:23,140
- No.
- Oh, now, think.

1090
01:24:25,820 --> 01:24:27,860
Some sort of test?

1091
01:24:28,420 --> 01:24:31,140
Just so you remember,
none of your little tricks.

1092
01:24:43,820 --> 01:24:45,100
Tea tastes like almonds.

01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:47,900
Must be the almond cookies.

1094
01:24:48,220 --> 01:24:49,860
Oh, yes.

1095
01:24:53,940 --> 01:24:55,380
Excuse me.

1096
01:25:23,620 --> 01:25:25,900
You should see the way the fire...

1097
01:25:26,620 --> 01:25:28,700
...lights up your hair.

1098
01:25:31,540 --> 01:25:34,540
All yellow and gold.

1099
01:25:36,980 --> 01:25:38,900
Such lovely hair.
