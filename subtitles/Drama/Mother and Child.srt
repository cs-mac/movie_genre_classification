I spoke to Bill Colden 
 about you.

He says you're one of 
 the best lawyers 
 he's ever worked with.

We had 
 a good relationship.

He runs that firm well.

18

Yes, he does.

19
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:22,670
So, in your estimation, 
 what are your 
 professional strengths?

20
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,540
Well, I don't believe 
 in improvisation.

21
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,640
I prepare 
 my cases rigorously.

22
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:31,470
I'm on top of clients. 
 I handle them well.

23
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,840
I protect them 
 from themselves.

24
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,640
I prefer to work on 
 a project by myself,

25
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:39,370
but I can work 
 just as well in a team, 
 if necessary.

26
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:42,100
I work equally well 
 with men or women,

27
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,310
but I prefer 
 to report to a man.

28
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,210
Why's that?

29
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,500
Many women 
 find me threatening.

30
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:51,700
Would I be 
 reporting to you?

Yes.

32
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,010
So, we'd have nothing 
 to worry about, then.

(CHUCKLING)

34

Why do you think women 
 find you threatening?

35
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:05,740
I'm not in the sisterhood. 
 I'm my own person.

36
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:13,580
I saw from this 
 that you moved to and from 
 this area several times.

37
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:17,050
I've gone wherever 
 I've had to go 
 to get ahead.

38
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:19,170
But you always 
 return here.

39

This part of the world 
 is as good as any.

40
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:28,570
Well, Elizabeth, 
 your resume 
 is very impressive.

41
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,770
It's no secret 
 you'd be a great asset 
 to us.

42
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,200
I would not 
 disappoint you.

43
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:34,470
If you wouldn't mind,

44
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:37,610
could you give me 
 some of your 
 personal background?

45
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,510
I was born here 
 in Los Angeles.

46
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,880
And I was given up 
 for adoption 
 on the day of my birth.

47
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,440
My mother was 14 
 when she had me.

48
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,610
And that's all I know 
 about her.

49
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,240
My adoptive father died 
 when I was 10.

50
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,010
My adoptive mother and I 
 are not close.

51
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,840
My name, 
 Elizabeth Joyce,

52
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,900
is one I picked out 
 for myself 
 in junior high.

53
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:08,070
It's my legal name now. 
 I don't go by any other.

54
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:09,870
I live alone.

55
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,970
I have 
 since I turned 17.

56
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,340
I've never 
 been married,

57
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,940
and I have no plans 
 to marry.

58
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:22,640
I value my independence 
 above all things.

59
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:25,940
That way I don't have 
 any expectations to fulfill

60
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:29,070
other than my own, 
 which are great enough.

 from the beginning.

But we just haven't 
 been able to.

 you know, against hope, 
 as they say.

But that just 
 isn't going to be.

And we've accepted that.

68
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:59,600
And we're not bitter. 
 I mean, I don't think.

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,070
Do you think 
 we're bitter 
 about it?

No. No, we're not.

And, we could learn 
 to love a baby

even if 
 it wasn't ours.

77
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,940
Would we get to name 
 the baby ourselves?

78
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,680
It depends on 
 the circumstances.

79
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,920
Sometimes 
 the biological parents

80
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,770
and the adoptive parents 
 agree on a name.

81
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,640
We could agree 
 to agree.

Yeah, well, 
 I didn't see eye-to-eye 
 with my supervisor.

00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,500
She was sloppy

296
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:47,560
and she needed me 
 to pick up the slack 
 for her.

297
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:50,910
I got tired of it 
 and I told her so.

And she had me fired.

You don't believe 
 that a higher being

created you and loves you, 
 and looks after you?

No. I'm sorry.

I believe that 
 when we're born 
 we come from nothing.

And that when we die 
 we go back to nothing.

536
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,340
That what we make 
 of our lives

is as a result of 
 our will and our luck,

 of our character,

00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:08,770
We've never met.

800
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:10,530
So what can I 
 do for you?

801
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:13,540
I'm a month late 
 with my period.

802
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:14,840
Are you sexually active?

803
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:16,200
I'm not pregnant.

804
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:17,600
What form of birth control 
 do you use?

805
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:18,660
My tubes are tied.

806
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:21,370
How long have 
 they been tied?

807
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:23,500
Since I was 17.

808
00:54:23,570 --> 00:54:24,600
That's unusual.

809
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:27,260
It's not a procedure 
 normally done on minors,

810
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:28,530
except for medical reasons.

811
00:54:29,470 --> 00:54:31,530
I had it done 
 across the border.

812
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:33,310
They didn't know 
 I was a minor.

813
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:39,770
Any other symptoms, 
 abdominal pain, 
 cramps, fever?

814
00:54:39,830 --> 00:54:41,100
No. 
 No? Okay.

815
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,540
Let's take a look at you.

816
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:55,100
Were you at USC Law?

817
00:54:56,170 --> 00:54:57,230
I have met you.

818
00:54:57,630 --> 00:55:00,200
I'm friends 
 with Sophie Sparrow 
 and Nina Marshall.

819
00:55:00,270 --> 00:55:02,180
You used to live 
 next door to them.

820
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:04,580
We never actually talked.

821
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:06,830
You were... You were 
 a little intimidating.

822
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:09,870
What's wrong?

823
00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:12,270
You know, I don't appreciate 
 looking back on my life

824
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:13,710
with someone 
 I've known for two minutes.

825
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:17,540
Oh, I'm sorry. 
 I didn't mean anything 
 by that.

826
00:55:19,430 --> 00:55:20,500
I'm so sorry.

827
00:55:20,570 --> 00:55:23,170
That was unprofessional 
 and bad timing.

828
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:26,070
I don't presume 
 to know anything about you.

829
00:55:27,130 --> 00:55:28,200
Please forgive me.

830
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,740
Okay.

831
00:56:02,970 --> 00:56:05,840
I'll have the nurse 
 get a blood sample 
 and some urine.

832
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:11,110
You could be pregnant. 
 It's not impossible.

833
00:56:29,870 --> 00:56:32,310
I'm done, Karen. 
 I'll see you next week.

834
00:56:47,630 --> 00:56:48,940
Thank you.

 for Her fucking Majesty 
 to find me?

845

It's better this way.

We're all better off 
 like this.

847

Why do you ask?

848
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:55,600
I thought she'd be 
 very pleased 
 with who you are.

Since you landed here,

853

I can't tell 
 if I'm coming or going.

In fact your willfulness 
 is a great part of your charm.

857

But it's getting 
 a little scary for me, 
 having these feelings.

858
00:58:40,670 --> 00:58:42,800
I'm going to 
 have to bow out.

859

You don't seem like a man 
 who's scared by scary things.

860
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:56,030
It's precaution.

 something to you.

She was given up 
 for adoption.

write her letters

And I buy her 
 birthday gifts.

 for her, Rachel.

The most kind-hearted man

You're my father's wife now.

My children 
 will grow to know you 
 as their grandmother.

990
01:10:30,570 --> 01:10:34,810
Because it's the time 
 spent together that counts, 
 more than blood.

991
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:38,000
Time counts the most.

<i>AMANDA:</i> Well, Elizabeth.

To say that you are 
 grossly overqualified

998
01:10:58,330 --> 01:10:59,900

I don't care

 about what Melissa said?

1013

I actually 
 agree with her.

I think you should 
 look for her.

1015

Why?

1016
01:11:58,060 --> 01:12:01,270
Because whatever happens 
 when you meet her, Karen,

1017
01:12:02,430 --> 01:12:04,210
it'll be easier than

1018
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:08,030
this thing that's 
 eating away at you.

1019
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:12,600
Why haven't you 
 told me this before?

1020
01:12:12,670 --> 01:12:14,970
I was working my way 
 towards it.

1021
01:12:19,900 --> 01:12:22,140
She might be out there 
 looking for you.

1022
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:24,340
Have you thought about that?

1023
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:30,770
There's nothing that 
 I haven't thought of.

1024
01:12:32,470 --> 01:12:34,140
You'd know where to start?

1025
01:12:34,740 --> 01:12:36,030
Mmm-hmm.

1026
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:39,070
So, what's your 
 biggest fear?

1027
01:12:42,030 --> 01:12:44,340
That she'll spit in my face.

1028
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:51,900
You delivered 
 on November 7th, 1973.

1029
01:12:52,930 --> 01:12:55,600
Your mother 
 was the legal guardian 
 of the baby.

1030
01:12:55,670 --> 01:12:58,300
You agreed to that 
 before she was born.

1031
01:12:59,260 --> 01:13:02,330
And a couple adopted 
 the baby on November 10th.

1032
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:07,300
Unfortunately, the provisions 
 of the adoption

1033
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:09,470
don't allow me 
 to give out any information

1034
01:13:09,530 --> 01:13:12,240
regarding the identity 
 of the parties involved.

1035
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:16,530
What you can do 
 is write a letter to her.

1036
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:19,170
The letter will be 
 kept in the file.

1037
01:13:19,230 --> 01:13:22,940
And if she were 
 ever to contact us, 
 we would give her the letter

1038
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:26,330
and she would be free 
 to reach out to you directly.

1039
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:35,040
I'm sorry, 
 that is the best I can do.

1040
01:13:38,260 --> 01:13:40,140
Oh, so, if she had been here,

1041
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:41,730
she would've been 
 told the same thing.

1042
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:43,570
That's right.

1043
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:47,130
So, if she was here, 
 she didn't leave me a letter.

1044
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:49,630
Well, there's no letter 
 in the file.

1045
01:13:50,230 --> 01:13:51,330
So,

1046
01:13:52,630 --> 01:13:57,970
she's either not looking, 
 or she didn't want 
 to write a letter

1047
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:01,010
or she thinks 
 I'm not looking for her.

1048
01:14:01,070 --> 01:14:03,740
Maybe she doesn't know 
 where to look.

1049
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:05,960
Well, I really 
 encourage you 
 to write a letter

1050
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:08,130
because it works.
