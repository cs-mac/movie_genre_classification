1
00:02:51,883 --> 00:02:55,284
"He that shall lose his life for me
shall find it.

2
00:02:56,588 --> 00:02:58,579
"If thou wilt be perfect...

3
00:02:58,924 --> 00:03:02,758
"go sell what thou hast
and give to the poor...

4
00:03:02,828 --> 00:03:04,819
"and come follow me. "

5
00:03:08,533 --> 00:03:12,128
Each sister shall understand
that on entering the convent...

6
00:03:12,337 --> 00:03:15,704
she has made the sacrifice
of her life to God.

7
00:04:49,568 --> 00:04:52,002
Well, are we off?

8
00:04:52,304 --> 00:04:56,172
-Whenever you're ready, Father.
-Let's not wait for that.

9
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,675
Your hat's on crooked.

10
00:05:01,413 --> 00:05:04,780
I tried to put it on without a mirror
to get used to....

11
00:05:10,088 --> 00:05:11,248
There.

12
00:05:14,059 --> 00:05:18,655
Marie didn't want to say goodbye.
And I'd rather not see Louise.

13
00:05:18,997 --> 00:05:21,022
She'll be so upset and....

14
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:25,261
There's no chance. I'll wait outside.

15
00:05:31,376 --> 00:05:35,403
Now, Louise, I left some things upstairs
for you and Marie.

16
00:05:36,047 --> 00:05:40,541
Divide the dresses, but you keep
the blue ones because blue is your color.

17
00:06:03,074 --> 00:06:04,837
Take good care of Father.

18
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,435
And don't let him
do too many operations in one day.

19
00:06:07,512 --> 00:06:09,104
Why do you have to go, anyway?

20
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,374
Pierre.

21
00:06:10,649 --> 00:06:13,709
Come along, Gaby,
I ordered the table for 1 :00.

22
00:06:16,922 --> 00:06:19,254
I wish you all as happy as I am.

23
00:06:48,954 --> 00:06:51,889
Gaby, I can see you poor,
I can see you chaste.

24
00:06:51,957 --> 00:06:56,087
But I cannot see you, a strong-willed girl,
obedient to those bells.

25
00:06:57,595 --> 00:07:00,689
In the Congo, Father,
they'll be calling me to work I love.

26
00:07:00,765 --> 00:07:04,223
You may never get to the Congo.
You certainly can never ask for it.

27
00:07:04,302 --> 00:07:06,031
You know that, don't you?

28
00:07:06,438 --> 00:07:09,805
Your personal wishes cease to exist
when you enter that door.

29
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:15,609
Maybe it would be easier
if I went in alone, Father.

30
00:07:16,381 --> 00:07:20,181
You're not an orphan.
Or going without your father's consent.

31
00:07:20,785 --> 00:07:22,412
Please remember this, Gaby.

32
00:07:22,487 --> 00:07:25,581
Remember, if you ever decide
this is not right for you...

33
00:07:25,657 --> 00:07:29,286
there is no sense of failure
in coming back home.

34
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,884
Sister William.

35
00:08:16,808 --> 00:08:18,799
-Dr. Van der Mal?
-Yes?

36
00:08:18,877 --> 00:08:22,404
My name's Pascin.
You operated on me five years ago.

37
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,643
-Oh, yes. Left lung, wasn't it?
-No, the right.

38
00:08:26,484 --> 00:08:31,285
-May I present my daughter, Simone?
-And my daughter, Gabrielle.

39
00:08:36,628 --> 00:08:38,220
A great day.

40
00:08:43,334 --> 00:08:45,063
-Dr. Van der Mal?
-Sister.

41
00:08:45,136 --> 00:08:48,128
I am Sister Margarita,
Mistress of Postulants.

42
00:08:49,107 --> 00:08:50,335
Welcome.

43
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:55,170
Of course you know Sister William
from the hospital.

44
00:08:55,246 --> 00:08:58,682
Sister William and I
have shared many an anxious hour.

45
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,148
Sister William says Gabrielle
will be a truly great nurse.

46
00:09:05,223 --> 00:09:08,021
I know you are largely responsible for that.

47
00:09:08,093 --> 00:09:12,257
-I'll miss her in my laboratory.
-We'll put her to good use in ours.

48
00:09:13,465 --> 00:09:15,296
Real spirit, I think.

49
00:09:16,201 --> 00:09:20,103
Well, we call it stubbornness.
You may, too, after a few weeks.

50
00:09:20,572 --> 00:09:22,540
We'll be going in shortly.

51
00:09:22,607 --> 00:09:25,405
-Good afternoon, Doctor.
-Good afternoon, Sister.

52
00:09:28,613 --> 00:09:32,140
I suppose Sister Margarita
is what they call a living rule.

53
00:09:32,217 --> 00:09:33,616
What's that?

54
00:09:33,918 --> 00:09:37,012
They say if the holy rule of a convent
were destroyed...

55
00:09:37,088 --> 00:09:41,354
it could be recaptured by studying
the behavior of such a perfect nun.

56
00:09:44,195 --> 00:09:46,220
-Doctor.
-Sister.

57
00:09:48,466 --> 00:09:50,434
The dowry, I think, Father.

58
00:09:51,035 --> 00:09:53,435
Oh, yes, of course.

59
00:09:55,073 --> 00:09:56,734
Thank you, Doctor.

60
00:10:25,937 --> 00:10:28,269
Goodbye, Father. I'll miss you.

61
00:10:30,742 --> 00:10:32,334
I'll do my best.

62
00:10:33,044 --> 00:10:35,069
I want you to be proud of me.

63
00:10:35,246 --> 00:10:38,841
I don't want to be proud of you.
I want you to be happy.

64
00:10:39,584 --> 00:10:40,915
I am happy.

65
00:11:56,861 --> 00:12:00,558
Gabrielle, your number is 1,072.

66
00:12:01,165 --> 00:12:02,564
Thank you, Sister.

67
00:12:02,634 --> 00:12:04,864
You are blessed to have this number.

68
00:12:04,936 --> 00:12:09,703
It belonged to Sister Marie Polycarpe.
She was a nursing sister in the Congo.

69
00:12:16,014 --> 00:12:19,973
When you have your things, you will
form two columns and face the door.

70
00:12:24,022 --> 00:12:25,819
From now on, your place in line...

71
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:28,859
is determined by your age
in this community.

72
00:12:29,961 --> 00:12:32,361
The first admitted is the oldest.

73
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,523
That is Yvonne Duval.

74
00:12:34,899 --> 00:12:35,991
Here.

75
00:12:39,337 --> 00:12:42,670
Yvonne Duval. Henrietta de la Croix.

76
00:12:43,341 --> 00:12:47,004
Simone Pascin. Cecile de Planer.

77
00:12:47,812 --> 00:12:49,677
Gabrielle Van der Mal.

78
00:12:50,114 --> 00:12:51,638
Helen de Rode.

79
00:12:52,717 --> 00:12:56,153
Your hands must learn to stay still.
And out of sight.

80
00:12:56,421 --> 00:12:59,720
Except when they're needed
for nursing or prayer.

81
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:03,559
I'm so glad you're here, Sister William.

82
00:13:03,795 --> 00:13:07,026
When you go through that door,
I'm not here.

83
00:13:07,098 --> 00:13:09,362
For the six months
that you're a postulant...

84
00:13:09,434 --> 00:13:11,026
and the year as a novice...

85
00:13:11,102 --> 00:13:14,265
we may not speak to each other
except in matters of work.

86
00:13:14,572 --> 00:13:16,096
I didn't know.

87
00:13:20,178 --> 00:13:22,146
Do not fret about your veils.

88
00:13:22,547 --> 00:13:25,107
You will soon learn to dress
without mirrors.

89
00:13:26,551 --> 00:13:29,714
As you will learn tomorrow
when we start studying the Holy Rule...

90
00:13:29,787 --> 00:13:32,312
which governs our life
here in the community...

91
00:13:32,757 --> 00:13:35,885
one of the first conditions
is the rule of silence.

92
00:13:36,894 --> 00:13:39,761
Exterior and interior silence.

93
00:13:41,132 --> 00:13:44,659
We observe the Grand Silence
from after chapel at night...

94
00:13:44,902 --> 00:13:47,029
until after chapel in the morning.

95
00:13:49,307 --> 00:13:52,868
We will go now into chapel
for evening prayers.

96
00:17:14,946 --> 00:17:19,349
Dear children, you will have five days
of instruction and preparation...

97
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:23,884
before you are formally admitted
as postulants by the Superior General.

98
00:17:25,156 --> 00:17:28,887
We constantly strive toward perfection
by inner silence.

99
00:17:29,961 --> 00:17:31,826
The ultimate goal of this silence...

100
00:17:31,896 --> 00:17:35,457
is to make possible
constant conversation with God.

101
00:17:36,167 --> 00:17:38,328
Therefore, we do not talk loudly...

102
00:17:38,603 --> 00:17:41,572
nor do we engage
in useless conversations.

103
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,870
We close doors quietly.

104
00:17:45,843 --> 00:17:49,802
Whenever possible,
we use a kind of sign language.

105
00:17:52,283 --> 00:17:55,218
This means,
"May I have permission to speak?"

106
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,718
This means, "Excuse me."

107
00:18:00,091 --> 00:18:01,683
Shall we try it?

108
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,760
We do this to attract a sister's attention.

109
00:18:14,238 --> 00:18:15,762
Just the sleeve.

110
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,938
We never touch another sister, of course.

111
00:18:19,677 --> 00:18:22,703
We use signs, particularly during meals.

112
00:18:23,781 --> 00:18:26,614
We, of course,
never ask for things for ourselves.

113
00:18:26,884 --> 00:18:30,411
Each sister is alert to the needs
of her fellow sisters.

114
00:18:51,609 --> 00:18:54,169
In walking, dear children,
we never saunter...

115
00:18:54,245 --> 00:18:57,510
as though we had no place to go.
Nor do we hurry.

116
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:01,484
When we walk
through halls and corridors...

117
00:19:01,552 --> 00:19:05,181
we practice humility
by walking close to the walls.

118
00:19:05,523 --> 00:19:06,581
Now.

119
00:19:55,773 --> 00:19:57,570
Tomorrow, in the chapter hall...

120
00:19:57,641 --> 00:20:01,771
the Superior General will admit you
formally into the congregation.

121
00:20:01,879 --> 00:20:05,337
And you will begin
your six months?terms as postulants.

122
00:20:07,084 --> 00:20:10,611
The Reverend Mother Emmanuel
represents Christ among us.

123
00:20:10,988 --> 00:20:13,786
And as such she is loved
and obeyed by us.

124
00:21:10,347 --> 00:21:12,611
What do you ask, my children?

125
00:21:13,017 --> 00:21:16,953
To be admitted into this congregation.

126
00:21:17,188 --> 00:21:19,520
Arise in the name of God.

127
00:21:28,165 --> 00:21:31,999
Dear children, it is not easy to be a nun.

128
00:21:32,636 --> 00:21:35,537
It is not a life of refuge from the world.

129
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,999
It is a life of sacrifice.

130
00:21:38,542 --> 00:21:41,636
In a way, it is a life against nature.

131
00:21:42,413 --> 00:21:46,247
It is a never-ending struggle
for self-perfection.

132
00:21:46,984 --> 00:21:49,817
Some of you will have
more trouble than others.

133
00:21:50,487 --> 00:21:54,218
Poverty, chastity, and obedience
are extremely difficult.

134
00:21:54,525 --> 00:21:57,050
Each of us here can assure you of that.

135
00:21:57,795 --> 00:22:01,697
The sacrifices that are required
of us are bearable...

136
00:22:01,765 --> 00:22:04,233
only if we make them with love.

137
00:22:05,202 --> 00:22:08,399
Just as in the world
we can do impossible things...

138
00:22:08,472 --> 00:22:10,997
with a glad heart for a loved one...

139
00:22:11,275 --> 00:22:13,072
so it is with us.

140
00:22:13,744 --> 00:22:16,178
We can endure greater sacrifice...

141
00:22:16,814 --> 00:22:21,376
because the object of our love
is our Lord Jesus Christ.

142
00:22:22,186 --> 00:22:25,451
In order to come into closer union
with our Lord...

143
00:22:26,056 --> 00:22:28,957
you will be submitted
to exercises and tests...

144
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:32,220
which are designed
to root out your faults...

145
00:22:32,663 --> 00:22:34,358
curb your passions...

146
00:22:34,632 --> 00:22:37,829
and prepare you
for acquiring the virtues and grace.

147
00:22:38,269 --> 00:22:41,295
If you question
these exercises in humility...

148
00:22:41,572 --> 00:22:45,406
these steps towards a closer union
with our crucified Lord...

149
00:22:46,043 --> 00:22:48,341
you do not belong with us.

150
00:22:49,413 --> 00:22:53,042
Cloistered life is made up
of an infinity of small things.

151
00:22:53,651 --> 00:22:56,916
You must try to live the Holy Rule
not day by day...

152
00:22:57,221 --> 00:22:58,916
but minute by minute...

153
00:22:58,989 --> 00:23:02,516
in a state of constant alertness
against imperfections.

154
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:06,493
The perfect nun is one who,
for the love of God...

155
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:09,597
is obedient in all things unto death.

156
00:23:10,601 --> 00:23:14,867
Remember, dear children,
you can very easily cheat us, your sisters.

157
00:23:15,306 --> 00:23:19,037
But you can never cheat yourself. Or God.

158
00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:37,522
The postulant will learn
strict obedience to the bell...

159
00:23:37,594 --> 00:23:39,357
which is the voice of God.

160
00:23:39,697 --> 00:23:42,393
Stopping whatever she is doing instantly...

161
00:23:42,466 --> 00:23:45,526
when it calls to other duty or devotions.

162
00:23:47,972 --> 00:23:50,600
What is served for lunch, do you know?

163
00:23:52,042 --> 00:23:55,341
It doesn't matter.
They won't let me eat it, anyway.

164
00:24:27,044 --> 00:24:29,672
Twice each day for the rest of your lives...

165
00:24:29,747 --> 00:24:31,874
you will examine your consciences.

166
00:24:31,982 --> 00:24:33,813
And enter in these notebooks...

167
00:24:33,884 --> 00:24:37,081
each and every imperfection
against the Holy Rule.

168
00:24:38,389 --> 00:24:42,257
For example, if you drink
a glass of water between meals...

169
00:24:42,326 --> 00:24:44,351
without asking permission.

170
00:24:44,561 --> 00:24:47,086
If you leave a light on unnecessarily.

171
00:24:47,731 --> 00:24:51,098
If you're late for work, and so on.

172
00:24:52,403 --> 00:24:56,100
I accuse myself of breaking
the Grand Silence.

173
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:01,607
I accuse myself of
uncharitable thoughts about my sisters.

174
00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:07,082
I accuse myself of having drunk a glass of
water between meals without permission.

175
00:25:07,618 --> 00:25:10,849
I accuse myself of failing
in modesty of the eyes.

176
00:25:11,455 --> 00:25:14,151
I accuse myself of worldly desires.

177
00:25:14,992 --> 00:25:18,155
I accuse myself
of having spoken without necessity.

178
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:22,658
I accuse myself of laughing
during the Grand Silence.

179
00:25:24,068 --> 00:25:25,797
I accuse myself....

180
00:25:29,273 --> 00:25:31,741
I accuse myself of daydreaming.

181
00:25:32,643 --> 00:25:35,373
-I accuse myself....
-I accuse myself....

182
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,240
Enter.

183
00:26:23,961 --> 00:26:27,692
Yesterday I visited one of our sisters
who is ill in hospital.

184
00:26:27,764 --> 00:26:30,062
And your father was attending her.

185
00:26:31,034 --> 00:26:34,231
He asked about you. And about the Congo.

186
00:26:34,304 --> 00:26:38,138
And the bush station where he thinks
you would like to do your nursing.

187
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:42,042
I told him it was much too soon
even to think of it.

188
00:26:42,412 --> 00:26:44,175
Of course, Reverend Mother.

189
00:26:45,082 --> 00:26:47,949
-I....
-Well, go ahead.

190
00:26:49,953 --> 00:26:52,353
I just want to become a good nurse
and a good nun...

191
00:26:52,422 --> 00:26:54,390
and to do God's work wherever I'm sent.

192
00:26:54,458 --> 00:26:56,426
First become a good nun.

193
00:26:56,894 --> 00:27:00,330
We select only the very strongest sisters
for our missions.

194
00:27:01,031 --> 00:27:04,865
Your nursing qualifications would
seem to make you a likely candidate.

195
00:27:05,235 --> 00:27:09,171
But you are still very far
from being mature in the religious life.

196
00:27:09,773 --> 00:27:13,174
Maturity is the armor of our missionaries.

197
00:27:13,977 --> 00:27:16,707
And this is not achieved in a day.

198
00:27:18,248 --> 00:27:20,716
Since tomorrow is the day of vesture...

199
00:27:20,784 --> 00:27:23,412
when you receive the habit of a novice...

200
00:27:23,487 --> 00:27:26,012
we must talk today about detachment.

201
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:31,154
You have already detached yourselves
from family and friends.

202
00:27:32,129 --> 00:27:36,691
Now we have the difficult detachment
from things and memories.

203
00:27:38,068 --> 00:27:40,332
Tonight, when you go to your cells...

204
00:27:40,504 --> 00:27:42,995
you will find parts of your new habit.

205
00:27:43,707 --> 00:27:48,007
And on your tables, the only possessions
allowed you from now on.

206
00:27:49,713 --> 00:27:51,704
A basket will be passed.

207
00:27:52,549 --> 00:27:55,677
And you must put in it,
of your own free will...

208
00:27:56,386 --> 00:27:58,411
any object you still have...

209
00:27:58,989 --> 00:28:02,220
which might call up memories
of your former life.

210
00:28:54,811 --> 00:28:56,836
What do you ask, my daughters?

211
00:28:57,347 --> 00:29:00,680
We ask for the mercy of God.

212
00:29:01,051 --> 00:29:03,815
And for the favor to be received...

213
00:29:03,887 --> 00:29:06,014
into this congregation.

214
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:08,415
We offer our Lord...

215
00:29:08,492 --> 00:29:12,189
our liberty, our memory, and our will.

216
00:29:12,329 --> 00:29:16,959
And we ask only for His love
and His holy grace.

217
00:29:17,901 --> 00:29:19,892
Are you firmly resolved...

218
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:23,703
to despise the honors, riches...

219
00:29:24,541 --> 00:29:27,442
and all the vain pleasures of this world...

220
00:29:27,911 --> 00:29:31,005
in order to prepare
for a closer union with God?

221
00:29:31,715 --> 00:29:35,207
We are so resolved, Monsignor.

222
00:29:35,719 --> 00:29:39,018
Do you make this request
of your own free will?

223
00:29:39,089 --> 00:29:40,420
-Yes.
-Yes.

224
00:29:44,995 --> 00:29:47,520
May the Lord, who has begun this...

225
00:29:48,265 --> 00:29:51,530
-bring it to perfection.
-Amen.

226
00:31:36,339 --> 00:31:37,829
Go, my children...

227
00:31:37,908 --> 00:31:40,934
divest yourselves
of the vanity of this world.

228
00:31:41,478 --> 00:31:45,141
And receive for your bodies
the habit of humility.

229
00:35:13,123 --> 00:35:17,617
Yvonne Duval
will be known as Sister Marie Sebastian.

230
00:35:18,361 --> 00:35:22,957
Henrietta de la Croix
will be known as Sister Marie Bernadette.

231
00:35:26,936 --> 00:35:31,600
Simone Pascin
will be known as Sister Marie Christine.

232
00:35:32,742 --> 00:35:37,179
Cecile de Planer
will be known as Sister Marie Joseph.

233
00:35:42,252 --> 00:35:46,245
Gabrielle Van der Mal
will be known as Sister Luke.

234
00:36:11,881 --> 00:36:14,543
Sister, you make a beautiful nun.

235
00:36:21,124 --> 00:36:22,318
Sister.

236
00:36:42,746 --> 00:36:44,338
You're blushing.

237
00:36:44,748 --> 00:36:47,239
It happened to me, too, in my ward.

238
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:50,018
We shouldn't blush, I'm sure we shouldn't.

239
00:36:50,086 --> 00:36:51,849
How can we help it?

240
00:36:52,388 --> 00:36:55,186
It must mean
some wrong awareness of self.

241
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:58,627
Must we write it in our notebooks?

242
00:36:59,863 --> 00:37:01,330
I don't know.

243
00:37:01,631 --> 00:37:04,225
Should we write that we talked alone?

244
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:11,700
I always start it.

245
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,549
Your training as a postulant
has been mostly in externals.

246
00:37:27,891 --> 00:37:30,587
Now, as novices,
you will be devoting the next year...

247
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,958
to the real formation of a nun.

248
00:37:33,096 --> 00:37:36,657
During that entire year,
none of you will leave the Mother House.

249
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,966
We will pay particular attention
to the removal of faults...

250
00:37:41,237 --> 00:37:44,638
the control of passions,
and the acquiring of virtue...

251
00:37:44,707 --> 00:37:47,107
so that you may be born again in Christ.

252
00:37:47,277 --> 00:37:51,441
We will have exercises to develop charity,
forbearance, and humility...

253
00:37:51,514 --> 00:37:53,948
and tests to destroy love of self.

254
00:37:54,984 --> 00:37:58,181
Two of these tests
are the culpa and the penance.

255
00:38:00,123 --> 00:38:02,648
From now on, in addition
to writing in your notebooks...

256
00:38:02,725 --> 00:38:04,124
you will once a week...

257
00:38:04,194 --> 00:38:07,891
proclaim before your sisters
your external faults against the Rule.

258
00:38:07,964 --> 00:38:11,923
And you will be given a penance
to perform in refectory or in chapel.

259
00:38:13,102 --> 00:38:17,266
The degree of humiliation will tell you
how much pride is still alive in you.

260
00:38:18,141 --> 00:38:20,769
Only as your pride slowly crumble...

261
00:38:20,977 --> 00:38:23,775
will you get the first glimpse
of true humility.

262
00:38:24,681 --> 00:38:27,275
If any sister has observed you
in an external fault...

263
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:28,817
which you have not proclaimed...

264
00:38:28,885 --> 00:38:30,785
it is her duty to proclaim you in charity...

265
00:38:30,854 --> 00:38:34,221
so that you may be aware
of your errors and correct them.

266
00:38:34,657 --> 00:38:39,287
I say my culpa for speaking without
necessity, for being late for chapel...

267
00:38:39,362 --> 00:38:41,762
for letting a door slam without penance.

268
00:38:46,269 --> 00:38:48,635
What do you have to say in charity?

269
00:38:48,705 --> 00:38:52,869
I proclaim my sister for giving in
to the temptation of vanity...

270
00:38:53,076 --> 00:38:55,840
by looking at herself in a glass window.

271
00:38:59,048 --> 00:39:01,778
You will say three Hail Marys
in refectory...

272
00:39:01,851 --> 00:39:04,718
for the sister who had the charity
to proclaim you.

273
00:39:04,921 --> 00:39:07,856
And three Hail Marys
for each imperfection.

274
00:39:08,458 --> 00:39:11,427
And pray God to help you
to perfect yourself.

275
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:17,466
Mother, I will try to correct myself
with the grace of God.

276
00:39:27,477 --> 00:39:30,605
I say my culpa
for breaking the rule of obedience...

277
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:33,513
by not stopping work
when I heard the bell.

278
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:36,744
For having spilled milk
twice in the refectory.

279
00:39:36,953 --> 00:39:40,514
For having spoken without necessity
during Grand Silence.

280
00:39:46,996 --> 00:39:49,396
What have you to say in charity?

281
00:40:01,277 --> 00:40:04,269
I proclaim myself and Sister Luke...

282
00:40:04,347 --> 00:40:06,747
for seeking each other's company.

283
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:13,885
You will ask God to help you
to overcome this attachment...

284
00:40:14,757 --> 00:40:18,989
and you will kiss the feet of the nuns
and beg your bread in refectory.

285
00:40:25,034 --> 00:40:29,061
Mother, I will try to correct myself
with the grace of God.

286
00:41:40,109 --> 00:41:41,542
Dear Lord...

287
00:41:41,944 --> 00:41:44,742
the more I try,
the more imperfect I become.

288
00:41:45,448 --> 00:41:48,975
I seem to fail in charity,
humility, and obedience.

289
00:41:50,119 --> 00:41:52,644
Pride has not been burned out of me.

290
00:41:54,757 --> 00:41:57,021
When I succeed in obeying the Rule...

291
00:41:57,093 --> 00:42:00,790
I fail at the same time
because I have pride in succeeding.

292
00:42:15,311 --> 00:42:18,974
Tomorrow you go on retreat
before taking the first vows, don't you?

293
00:42:19,182 --> 00:42:21,616
The Grand Silence doesn't matter for me.

294
00:42:21,684 --> 00:42:24,209
I'm not taking my vows. I'm leaving.

295
00:42:25,188 --> 00:42:28,919
So I can talk without having to say a culpa
or do a penance.

296
00:42:31,294 --> 00:42:32,352
Why?

297
00:42:33,096 --> 00:42:36,463
Mother Emmanuel said,
"Remember, you can cheat us...

298
00:42:36,532 --> 00:42:39,228
"but you cannot cheat yourself or God."

299
00:42:40,436 --> 00:42:43,234
Well, to go on would be cheating God.

300
00:42:44,207 --> 00:42:47,370
-To be a hypocrite.
-We all have our doubts.

301
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:50,035
-My confessor--
-Of course.

302
00:42:50,413 --> 00:42:52,074
But I know myself.

303
00:42:53,249 --> 00:42:55,240
I could never be like you.

304
00:42:55,618 --> 00:42:57,279
As strong as you.

305
00:42:58,754 --> 00:43:00,745
I'm the weakest of us all.

306
00:43:00,823 --> 00:43:03,883
If you were,
you would not be taking your vows.

307
00:43:05,661 --> 00:43:09,688
Now I've earned you another penance
by talking to you in the Grand Silence.

308
00:43:09,765 --> 00:43:11,130
I'm sorry.

309
00:43:12,902 --> 00:43:14,199
Goodbye.

310
00:43:17,607 --> 00:43:19,006
Pray for me.

311
00:43:53,943 --> 00:43:57,902
"I, Gabrielle Van der Mal,
known as Sister Luke...

312
00:43:58,281 --> 00:44:02,342
"promise to God in the presence
of Your Grace and our Reverend Mother...

313
00:44:02,585 --> 00:44:05,577
"to obey the Holy Rule
of this congregation...

314
00:44:05,755 --> 00:44:10,283
"and to persevere in the life
of obedience, chastity, and poverty...

315
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,859
"for the period of three years. Amen."

316
00:45:37,046 --> 00:45:41,278
Sister Luke, this is the discipline
for penance in private.

317
00:45:41,751 --> 00:45:46,313
You will use it twice each week at night
while you are saying the Miserere.

318
00:45:47,456 --> 00:45:50,653
Remember, it is essentially
a symbol of penance.

319
00:45:51,093 --> 00:45:54,085
Too much is as bad as too little.

320
00:45:55,564 --> 00:45:59,000
Don't forget you are only an instrument.

321
00:45:59,735 --> 00:46:04,229
In yourself you are nothing,
until you are lifted up.

322
00:46:07,476 --> 00:46:11,606
Tomorrow you will leave for the School
of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp.

323
00:46:37,073 --> 00:46:38,404
Excuse me.

324
00:46:49,518 --> 00:46:52,510
Your father's daughter. Excellent.

325
00:47:06,068 --> 00:47:07,433
Excuse me.

326
00:47:20,116 --> 00:47:21,242
Well.

327
00:47:24,587 --> 00:47:27,283
Sister Pauline,
how long were you in the Congo?

328
00:47:27,523 --> 00:47:28,683
Seven years.

329
00:47:28,758 --> 00:47:31,158
You worked quite a lot with the lepers,
didn't you?

330
00:47:31,227 --> 00:47:32,524
-Yes.
-Yes!

331
00:47:32,628 --> 00:47:35,995
Well, that is the bacillus
which causes leprosy!

332
00:47:37,099 --> 00:47:38,760
Thank you, Doctor.

333
00:47:42,938 --> 00:47:46,669
I, too, have lost some of my quickness,
my memory...

334
00:47:47,576 --> 00:47:49,567
from too much Congo sun.

335
00:47:50,679 --> 00:47:52,306
Too much quinine.

336
00:47:53,048 --> 00:47:57,712
If any of you think that the Congo
that you'll find today in 1930...

337
00:47:57,787 --> 00:48:02,019
is anything like the Congo that we found
when we went there 20 years ago...

338
00:48:02,091 --> 00:48:03,922
you will be mistaken.

339
00:48:07,129 --> 00:48:10,929
There are now bicycle paths
through the brush.

340
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:18,806
Close that window, somebody,
will you? There.

341
00:48:20,142 --> 00:48:24,579
I know you think it's hot.
Wait till you've had your share of malaria.

342
00:48:26,515 --> 00:48:29,814
Don't be selfish, Sister Luke,
help your sisters.

343
00:48:32,188 --> 00:48:35,157
She was brought up
looking through a microscope, you know...

344
00:48:35,891 --> 00:48:39,088
whilst most of you
were playing with kaleidoscopes.

345
00:48:41,063 --> 00:48:44,692
Sister Luke, would you help me with this?

346
00:48:59,048 --> 00:49:01,949
That is the bacille de Koch
that causes tuberculosis.

347
00:49:02,017 --> 00:49:05,453
-I thought it was the leprosy bacillus.
-They are very alike.

348
00:49:05,521 --> 00:49:08,046
Both rod-shaped, both acid-fast...

349
00:49:08,491 --> 00:49:12,484
both with a slight shadow
almost like an enclosing capsule.

350
00:49:13,329 --> 00:49:15,092
But if you look very closely...

351
00:49:15,164 --> 00:49:19,328
you'll see that the leprosy bacillus
is slightly fatter and longer.

352
00:50:12,555 --> 00:50:13,749
Enter.

353
00:50:36,045 --> 00:50:38,377
I'm in trouble, Reverend Mother.

354
00:50:38,781 --> 00:50:40,544
It's Sister Pauline.

355
00:50:40,683 --> 00:50:44,915
My conscience is not at peace because
of my unfriendly feelings towards her.

356
00:50:46,789 --> 00:50:50,225
At the Mother House, we were told
to overcome feelings like this...

357
00:50:50,292 --> 00:50:52,226
by trying to help the person.

358
00:50:52,361 --> 00:50:55,797
For five months I've tried to help
Sister Pauline in the courses.

359
00:50:55,864 --> 00:50:57,331
She needs help.

360
00:50:58,133 --> 00:51:00,397
But she will not permit friendship...

361
00:51:01,170 --> 00:51:03,195
and so I do not know what to do.

362
00:51:03,372 --> 00:51:05,670
Sister Pauline has already come to me.

363
00:51:06,041 --> 00:51:08,271
The feeling you describe is mutual.

364
00:51:09,278 --> 00:51:11,473
She thinks you are full of pride.

365
00:51:11,981 --> 00:51:15,109
She does not believe
that you can ever achieve humility.

366
00:51:17,486 --> 00:51:20,819
I'm ashamed, My Mother,
for her and for me.

367
00:51:22,257 --> 00:51:24,953
All this sounds very childish
when you tell it.

368
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:27,858
Her dislike, I believe, is based on fear.

369
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:31,859
She worries that she will
not be able to pass the examination.

370
00:51:31,934 --> 00:51:35,461
Or if she does,
that she will be far below you in grade.

371
00:51:36,005 --> 00:51:39,839
This could easily mean
that she could not return to the Congo.

372
00:51:41,577 --> 00:51:45,570
You have been given a truly great
opportunity to make a sacrifice for God.

373
00:51:45,814 --> 00:51:47,941
You asked what you might do?

374
00:51:49,818 --> 00:51:51,615
Would you, Sister Luke...

375
00:51:51,687 --> 00:51:54,918
be able to fail your examination
to show humility?

376
00:52:09,872 --> 00:52:11,271
My Mother...

377
00:52:14,943 --> 00:52:19,004
I would be willing if the Mother House
knows of this and approves.

378
00:52:19,081 --> 00:52:22,278
Then it would be a humility with hooks,
as we say.

379
00:52:22,551 --> 00:52:26,009
A humility that takes something back
for the sacrifice.

380
00:52:26,255 --> 00:52:30,521
In this case, the satisfaction of knowing
that the Mother House knows.

381
00:52:30,659 --> 00:52:33,093
-Courage needs witnesses.
-Yes.

382
00:52:33,529 --> 00:52:35,360
Real humility, on the other hand...

383
00:52:35,431 --> 00:52:37,956
passes unperceived
between God and the soul.

384
00:52:38,267 --> 00:52:41,532
You have heard our phrase,
"Do good and disappear."

385
00:52:43,739 --> 00:52:46,173
How do we know when we are humble?

386
00:52:46,742 --> 00:52:49,370
When we can accept a real humiliation.

387
00:52:49,778 --> 00:52:51,575
Such as this failure.

388
00:52:56,919 --> 00:52:59,547
How can I know God wants this from me?

389
00:52:59,955 --> 00:53:01,479
Go and ask Him.

390
00:53:01,857 --> 00:53:06,191
But remember, you are weighing an
opportunity that may never come again.

391
00:53:06,261 --> 00:53:08,252
Out of His eternal time...

392
00:53:08,330 --> 00:53:11,493
God chooses His moment
to offer the most perfect alliance...

393
00:53:11,567 --> 00:53:13,592
with each individual soul.

394
00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:24,911
-Good morning, Sister Luke.
-Good morning, Doctor.

395
00:53:26,081 --> 00:53:30,347
I promised I would call your father
immediately after the examination.

396
00:53:32,588 --> 00:53:35,989
I shall defer to my eminent colleagues
for the first question.

397
00:53:37,659 --> 00:53:40,992
Sister, the board would like
to hear from you...

398
00:53:41,396 --> 00:53:45,298
in what parts of the tsetse fly
will the trypanosomes be found.

399
00:53:58,347 --> 00:54:00,975
You may take your time
with this question, Sister.

400
00:54:01,049 --> 00:54:03,984
We have been working on them
since the 1880s.

401
00:54:14,263 --> 00:54:16,493
They will be found in the....

402
00:54:19,601 --> 00:54:22,399
Perhaps you'd like the question repeated?

403
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,840
In the tsetse fly,
the trypanosomes will be found...

404
00:54:33,916 --> 00:54:36,908
in the gut,
mouth parts, and salivary glands...

405
00:54:36,985 --> 00:54:39,545
in all of which sites they multiply.

406
00:54:41,323 --> 00:54:45,760
We would like to hear a r¨¦sum¨¦ of the special clinical types of pernicious...

407
00:54:45,828 --> 00:54:48,991
as differentiated
from chronic or latent malaria.

408
00:54:49,164 --> 00:54:53,225
Cerebral, algid, bilious remittent fever,
blackwater fever...

409
00:54:53,302 --> 00:54:55,327
and bronchopneumonic form.

410
00:55:09,451 --> 00:55:10,884
I have good news.

411
00:55:10,953 --> 00:55:14,411
All four of our sisters
have passed their examinations.

412
00:55:18,327 --> 00:55:21,194
Sister Pauline will return to the Congo.

413
00:55:21,864 --> 00:55:24,264
Sisters Timothy and Ellen...

414
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:26,725
will go to the Congo, too.

415
00:55:27,502 --> 00:55:29,970
Sister Luke will leave tomorrow morning...

416
00:55:30,038 --> 00:55:34,031
to join the nursing staff
of our mental sanatorium near Brussels.

417
00:55:45,721 --> 00:55:49,418
Perhaps Reverend Mother feels
you are not yet ready for the Congo.

418
00:55:50,092 --> 00:55:53,323
You must learn to accept with love
whatever comes to you.

419
00:55:53,395 --> 00:55:55,829
It is essential in religious life.

420
00:55:56,465 --> 00:55:58,956
You passed fourth in a class of 80.

421
00:56:45,347 --> 00:56:48,407
Everything they do
is to be accepted as normal.

422
00:56:50,752 --> 00:56:53,152
Sister Agnes, Sister Luke.

423
00:56:53,822 --> 00:56:56,222
Good morning, Mother Christoph.

424
00:57:00,429 --> 00:57:02,989
Our practical nurses
stand a four-hour shift.

425
00:57:03,432 --> 00:57:07,528
Our sisters take unlimited duty,
sometimes from eight to 10 hours.

426
00:57:14,977 --> 00:57:18,276
These are the cells
for our most dangerous patients.

427
00:57:23,752 --> 00:57:26,243
We try to approach
even our most dangerous cases...

428
00:57:26,321 --> 00:57:28,949
with gentle and persuasive reasoning.

429
00:57:33,261 --> 00:57:37,595
Sister Berthold, this is Sister Luke,
who is to be with us for a while.

430
00:57:37,733 --> 00:57:39,667
-Sister Berthold.
-Sister Luke.

431
00:57:43,372 --> 00:57:45,932
This one thinks
that she is the Archangel Gabriel.

432
00:57:46,008 --> 00:57:47,771
So we call her that.

433
00:57:49,911 --> 00:57:51,936
Good afternoon, Archangel.

434
00:58:02,524 --> 00:58:05,084
She's a schizophrenic and very dangerous.

435
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:09,722
She has perfectly sane periods when
she talks intelligently about her farm.

436
00:58:10,198 --> 00:58:13,395
A sister is forbidden to open the door
of any of these cells...

437
00:58:13,468 --> 00:58:17,370
unless there is another sister with her.
Or a practical helper.

438
00:58:18,006 --> 00:58:21,533
One ought to be able to get through
to someone like her.

439
00:58:24,146 --> 00:58:27,115
-Hello.
-Hello, Archangel.

440
00:58:29,284 --> 00:58:32,947
This is the room where we give
the treatment for the violent cases.

441
00:58:33,522 --> 00:58:36,286
We keep them four to eight hours
in baths...

442
00:58:36,358 --> 00:58:38,622
maintained at a constant temperature.

443
00:58:41,296 --> 00:58:43,992
The sound that you hear are their heels...

444
00:58:44,332 --> 00:58:46,596
beating up and down against the tubs.

445
00:58:46,868 --> 00:58:48,301
Sister Marie is on duty.

446
00:58:48,370 --> 00:58:51,771
She generally remains there
from eight to 10 hours at a time.

447
00:59:12,761 --> 00:59:14,160
Sister Luke.

448
01:00:22,531 --> 01:00:24,590
It isn't one of my pleasantest duties...

449
01:00:24,666 --> 01:00:27,499
opening and reading
other people's letters, but...

450
01:00:27,702 --> 01:00:30,432
sometimes it does allow me to help them.

451
01:00:30,872 --> 01:00:33,932
As you see,
your father asks an angry question.

452
01:00:34,609 --> 01:00:37,806
Why should you waste
all these months of your time here...

453
01:00:37,879 --> 01:00:41,110
after your strenuous courses
in tropical medicine?

454
01:00:41,449 --> 01:00:43,747
I must apologize for my father.

455
01:00:44,753 --> 01:00:47,017
Your father's a very great man.

456
01:00:47,088 --> 01:00:48,953
But I don't think he understands...

457
01:00:49,024 --> 01:00:53,358
that the colonies are only for sisters
perfected in the religious life.

458
01:00:54,362 --> 01:00:57,695
He asks what you could possibly learn
in this place.

459
01:00:57,933 --> 01:01:02,165
When I'm permitted to write to him
I will tell him what I can learn here:

460
01:01:02,237 --> 01:01:03,568
obedience.

461
01:01:06,441 --> 01:01:09,535
Perhaps that's what Mother Emmanuel
had in mind.

462
01:01:10,011 --> 01:01:13,003
That this would make
an excellent proving ground.

463
01:01:13,081 --> 01:01:14,480
I shall try.

464
01:01:15,350 --> 01:01:17,341
And I shall try with you...

465
01:01:17,586 --> 01:01:20,714
since your soul is in my care
while you are here.

466
01:01:20,789 --> 01:01:22,882
Thank you, Reverend Mother.

467
01:02:25,987 --> 01:02:29,423
-Yes?
-I am so thirsty.

468
01:02:30,725 --> 01:02:33,250
May I have a drink of water, please?

469
01:02:36,598 --> 01:02:38,259
A terrible thirst.

470
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,865
The fish was so salty.

471
01:03:57,212 --> 01:03:58,474
Oh, God.

472
01:04:00,715 --> 01:04:01,977
God.

473
01:04:30,712 --> 01:04:31,701
Oh, God.

474
01:04:57,872 --> 01:04:59,339
The Archangel.

475
01:05:06,314 --> 01:05:09,306
Pride. Pride and disobedience.

476
01:05:11,352 --> 01:05:12,876
Always disobedience.

477
01:05:12,954 --> 01:05:16,754
Don't try to talk. I would probably
have done the same thing.

478
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:24,093
I accuse myself also of pride in thinking
I could handle the Archangel myself.

479
01:05:24,632 --> 01:05:29,228
I accuse myself of using personal
judgment in not ringing the bell for help.

480
01:05:30,238 --> 01:05:32,706
I accuse myself of a sense of heroism.

481
01:05:33,541 --> 01:05:36,476
Mother, in the three days
I've been lying in the infirmary...

482
01:05:36,544 --> 01:05:39,445
I have accused myself
of almost every possible imperfection...

483
01:05:39,514 --> 01:05:41,175
against the Holy Rule.

484
01:05:41,249 --> 01:05:43,581
They are always such glaring faults.

485
01:05:43,651 --> 01:05:45,619
At the School of Tropical Medicine...

486
01:05:45,687 --> 01:05:49,248
Mother Marcella offered me the chance
to show true humility...

487
01:05:49,324 --> 01:05:52,122
-by failing an examination.
-I know.

488
01:05:53,728 --> 01:05:55,753
Mother Marcella means well...

489
01:05:55,830 --> 01:05:59,266
but she was very wrong
to make that suggestion to you.

490
01:06:00,268 --> 01:06:04,864
My child, I don't underestimate for
a moment the seriousness of your faults.

491
01:06:05,540 --> 01:06:09,408
But you mustn't destroy yourself
with guilt and remorse.

492
01:06:10,278 --> 01:06:13,179
You must learn to bend a little
or you'll break.

493
01:06:13,248 --> 01:06:16,706
Long before I entered the order,
I had a rule of my own:

494
01:06:16,784 --> 01:06:18,308
All or nothing.

495
01:06:20,054 --> 01:06:22,284
I want to be a good nun or....

496
01:06:22,557 --> 01:06:25,082
You will be a good nun, Sister Luke.

497
01:06:27,862 --> 01:06:31,320
I thought one would reach
some sort of resting place...

498
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,527
where obedience would be natural
and struggle would end.

499
01:06:37,639 --> 01:06:39,971
There is no resting place. Ever.

500
01:06:40,542 --> 01:06:43,067
But you must have patience with yourself.

501
01:06:43,144 --> 01:06:45,977
Unhappy saints are lost
from the beginning.

502
01:06:46,281 --> 01:06:48,715
Ask for God's help and guidance...

503
01:06:48,783 --> 01:06:51,251
and I know you will make your final vows.

504
01:06:57,358 --> 01:06:59,053
"I, Sister Luke...

505
01:06:59,127 --> 01:07:03,427
"promise to God in the presence of
Your Grace and of our Reverend Mother...

506
01:07:03,498 --> 01:07:06,228
"to persevere in the life of obedience...

507
01:07:06,401 --> 01:07:08,301
"chastity, and poverty...

508
01:07:08,636 --> 01:07:10,695
"until death. Amen."

509
01:07:13,992 --> 01:07:15,687
I declare you from today...

510
01:07:15,761 --> 01:07:18,787
the bride of Jesus Christ,
Son of Almighty God.

511
01:07:33,111 --> 01:07:34,738
I declare you from today...

512
01:07:34,813 --> 01:07:37,873
the bride of Jesus Christ,
Son of Almighty God.

513
01:07:39,251 --> 01:07:43,984
-Mother, pray for me.
-My daughter, may God give you peace.

514
01:08:29,668 --> 01:08:31,761
Don't be proud of me, Father.

515
01:08:31,837 --> 01:08:33,702
This is really flight.

516
01:08:33,839 --> 01:08:37,741
It will be so much easier in the Congo
to remember I'm nothing.

517
01:08:37,809 --> 01:08:42,610
There will be no worldly associations
in a bush station, in the jungle.

518
01:09:11,810 --> 01:09:14,210
Please, God, let me do some good.

519
01:11:09,227 --> 01:11:11,195
Where's Mother Mathilde?

520
01:11:11,896 --> 01:11:14,694
We are very fortunate in Mother Mathilde.

521
01:11:18,269 --> 01:11:20,396
-Mama Augustine.
-Kalulu.

522
01:11:20,605 --> 01:11:23,972
-Welcome home, Mama Augustine.
-It's good to be back.

523
01:11:25,577 --> 01:11:28,410
Ilunga. This is Sister Luke.

524
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:30,638
This is Kalulu.

525
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:32,806
He practically runs the convent.

526
01:11:34,019 --> 01:11:36,749
Sister Augustine. Welcome back.

527
01:11:37,789 --> 01:11:39,051
Welcome.

528
01:11:43,395 --> 01:11:45,590
-This is Sister Aurelie.
-Sister.

529
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:46,721
Sister Luke.

530
01:11:46,798 --> 01:11:50,859
Now, a short boat trip across the Congo
and you're home.

531
01:12:08,787 --> 01:12:10,652
And there's the Congo.

532
01:13:07,178 --> 01:13:09,874
Drums tell your arrival, Mama Augustine.

533
01:13:09,948 --> 01:13:11,813
Yours, too, Mama Luke.

534
01:13:18,189 --> 01:13:20,623
What are the drums saying, Kalulu?

535
01:13:22,660 --> 01:13:25,151
Mama Augustine, she can read drums.

536
01:13:56,361 --> 01:13:57,453
Sister Luke....

537
01:13:57,529 --> 01:14:01,295
I thought it might amuse you to know
what the drums said about you last night.

538
01:14:01,366 --> 01:14:04,233
The way Kalulu laughed,
it must be something very funny.

539
01:14:04,302 --> 01:14:05,496
They said:

540
01:14:05,570 --> 01:14:08,505
"Held hands with Big Mama Mathilde
on way back to Sister House...

541
01:14:08,573 --> 01:14:11,940
"therefore esteemed.
Talks little, looks much.

542
01:14:12,277 --> 01:14:14,609
"Young enough to bear children."

543
01:14:26,424 --> 01:14:28,324
We call her the Novice.

544
01:14:29,627 --> 01:14:33,620
But like all little novices,
she's still imperfect in discipline.

545
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:39,102
Come along with me now on my rounds.
We'll start with the native hospital.

546
01:14:39,170 --> 01:14:41,968
How we've needed
this extra pair of hands.

547
01:15:20,645 --> 01:15:22,977
"Yambo"means hello.
But of course you know that.

548
01:15:23,047 --> 01:15:24,571
-You've been studying.
-Yes.

549
01:15:26,484 --> 01:15:29,180
-Mama Luke.
-Yambo, Mama Luke.

550
01:15:29,587 --> 01:15:33,148
Only one generation ago,
their fathers were savages in the forest.

551
01:15:33,224 --> 01:15:35,419
We couldn't run the hospital
without them.

552
01:15:35,493 --> 01:15:37,859
You'll notice
we haven't converted them all yet.

553
01:15:37,929 --> 01:15:41,729
Some still wear the witch doctor's fetish
around their necks.

554
01:15:46,704 --> 01:15:49,172
That is our surgeon, Dr. Fortunati.

555
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:51,333
He spends half his time here.

556
01:15:51,409 --> 01:15:54,401
The rest of the day
he operates in the white hospital.

557
01:16:14,766 --> 01:16:17,200
I'm afraid she's too fast for me...

558
01:16:17,268 --> 01:16:19,964
but nursing them every day, I'll learn.

559
01:16:32,750 --> 01:16:35,446
I see our chaplain, Father Andre, is here.

560
01:16:35,553 --> 01:16:36,884
He is greatly loved.

561
01:16:36,954 --> 01:16:39,582
Even the non-Catholics
hold their children up to him...

562
01:16:39,657 --> 01:16:41,852
to be blessed when he passes.

563
01:16:42,060 --> 01:16:43,322
Father Andre...

564
01:16:43,394 --> 01:16:45,555
you have a new soul to look after.

565
01:16:45,630 --> 01:16:47,598
-Sister Luke.
-Sister.

566
01:16:47,665 --> 01:16:49,690
-Father.
-We're so glad you are here.

567
01:16:49,767 --> 01:16:51,962
We do need another pair of hands.

568
01:16:52,036 --> 01:16:54,800
The barber's been itching
to get at that beard for years...

569
01:16:54,872 --> 01:16:57,170
but the natives
have a picture of God with a beard...

570
01:16:57,241 --> 01:16:59,732
so priests have to wear beards
in the Congo.

571
01:16:59,811 --> 01:17:02,974
No beard, no converts. Excuse me, please.

572
01:17:45,207 --> 01:17:49,507
We're only beginning to persuade them
to come to hospital to have their babies.

573
01:17:49,578 --> 01:17:51,773
Not all of them trust us, yet.

574
01:17:51,847 --> 01:17:54,975
Many of them still prefer
to deliver themselves in the bush.

575
01:17:55,050 --> 01:17:57,575
They scoop out a hole and that's it.

576
01:18:05,072 --> 01:18:07,973
That's how they call
our children to school.

577
01:19:53,581 --> 01:19:55,014
-Sister.
-Sister.

578
01:19:55,082 --> 01:19:58,711
Sister is teaching the mothers
how to wash their children.

579
01:20:00,888 --> 01:20:03,379
You know,
I had hoped to go to the bush station...

580
01:20:03,457 --> 01:20:06,654
but seeing all of this,
I'm very happy to be here.

581
01:20:07,728 --> 01:20:10,253
But Mother Emmanuel sent you a cable,
didn't she?

582
01:20:10,331 --> 01:20:12,265
Yes, that I was to be here with you.

583
01:20:12,333 --> 01:20:15,666
With us, yes,
but not at the native hospital.

584
01:20:16,303 --> 01:20:19,932
Across the way, at the white hospital,
with the Europeans.

585
01:20:43,631 --> 01:20:47,123
One of the nurses here got TB
and we had to send her home.

586
01:20:47,201 --> 01:20:50,295
TB makes further service
in the Congo impossible...

587
01:20:50,371 --> 01:20:52,862
so you'll have to hold down
two jobs over there.

588
01:20:52,940 --> 01:20:56,205
Supervising the nurses
and assisting Dr. Fortunati.

589
01:20:58,345 --> 01:20:59,744
I'm sorry...

590
01:21:00,347 --> 01:21:03,145
but it's a lesson
we all have to learn, isn't it?

591
01:21:03,517 --> 01:21:05,109
Disappointments.

592
01:21:05,453 --> 01:21:07,182
We'll go there now.

593
01:21:25,439 --> 01:21:27,999
-Good morning, Mama Mathilde.
-Ilunga, this is Sister Luke.

594
01:21:28,075 --> 01:21:29,235
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

595
01:21:29,310 --> 01:21:32,211
Ilunga will be your deputy here
at the hospital.

596
01:21:32,279 --> 01:21:33,405
Good.

597
01:21:53,300 --> 01:21:56,098
You will be assisting Dr. Fortunati here.

598
01:21:56,570 --> 01:21:59,198
He is a genius and a devil.

599
01:21:59,807 --> 01:22:02,241
He works himself to exhaustion...

600
01:22:02,309 --> 01:22:04,072
and his nurses, too.

601
01:22:04,645 --> 01:22:07,079
I'm used to doctors. My father....

602
01:22:09,016 --> 01:22:10,711
I'm sorry, I forgot.

603
01:22:10,784 --> 01:22:13,912
Your father is a great surgeon. I know.

604
01:22:15,155 --> 01:22:18,522
You must always leave surgery
the moment operations are over.

605
01:22:18,592 --> 01:22:20,958
You must never linger to discuss a case.

606
01:22:21,028 --> 01:22:24,054
You will be tempted to
because he is a marvel.

607
01:22:24,465 --> 01:22:26,865
But remember, he is also a man...

608
01:22:26,934 --> 01:22:28,231
a bachelor...

609
01:22:28,302 --> 01:22:30,497
and I'm afraid an unbeliever.

610
01:22:30,671 --> 01:22:35,165
Don't ever think for an instant, Sister,
that your habit will protect you.

611
01:22:36,310 --> 01:22:39,245
Now, I leave you
to look over your equipment.

612
01:22:40,481 --> 01:22:41,880
Yes, Mother.

613
01:23:43,077 --> 01:23:46,911
You will say six A ves and a Pater Noster
for that bit of vanity, Sister.

614
01:23:46,981 --> 01:23:49,973
I'm Dr. Fortunati.
You must be the new sister.

615
01:23:50,718 --> 01:23:53,312
-Yes, I'm Sister Luke.
-How do you do?

616
01:23:53,954 --> 01:23:56,889
-How do you do?
-Well, the drums were right.

617
01:23:58,459 --> 01:24:01,155
I see somebody told you what they said.

618
01:24:01,895 --> 01:24:04,625
I believe I'm to assist you
in the operating room, Doctor.

619
01:24:04,698 --> 01:24:05,892
Yes.

620
01:24:05,966 --> 01:24:08,457
I hope you bear up longer
than the last sister.

621
01:24:08,535 --> 01:24:10,127
I can only try.

622
01:24:11,238 --> 01:24:14,833
These summer months this room gets
like a bake-oven by 9:00 in the morning...

623
01:24:14,908 --> 01:24:18,207
so I operate at 5:00.
That means you get up at 4:00.

624
01:24:18,646 --> 01:24:20,113
I'll be here.

625
01:24:20,514 --> 01:24:23,608
And sometimes I operate
right through the time of your mass.

626
01:24:23,684 --> 01:24:25,743
So you'll get used to taking communion...

627
01:24:25,819 --> 01:24:28,185
at that door there, on those occasions.

628
01:24:28,255 --> 01:24:30,450
I'll have to ask permission
of Reverend Mother.

629
01:24:30,524 --> 01:24:33,652
Reverend Mother is not in charge here.
This is a government hospital.

630
01:24:33,727 --> 01:24:36,161
-Still, I'll--
-You're paid by the government...

631
01:24:36,230 --> 01:24:38,721
and therefore, you're responsible to them.

632
01:24:38,799 --> 01:24:41,131
They don't pay you to pray,
but to assist me.

633
01:24:41,201 --> 01:24:42,998
-I understand that.
-It's all right.

634
01:24:43,070 --> 01:24:45,800
The Reverend Mother's
given permission to the operating sisters.

635
01:24:45,873 --> 01:24:50,310
I can't have my nurses running off to mass
in the middle of an operation.

636
01:24:51,011 --> 01:24:52,774
5:00 in the morning?

637
01:24:52,913 --> 01:24:55,438
Have you ever assisted
at an operation before?

638
01:24:55,516 --> 01:24:58,508
Yes. My father's Dr. Hubert Van der Mal.

639
01:24:59,853 --> 01:25:01,184
I see.

640
01:25:01,355 --> 01:25:03,414
You'll say another five A ves
and beg your soup...

641
01:25:03,490 --> 01:25:05,958
for that little display of pride, Sister.

642
01:25:39,626 --> 01:25:41,389
These boys had better be trained to do...

643
01:25:41,462 --> 01:25:43,487
more than just stand around
dropping things.

644
01:25:43,564 --> 01:25:45,964
Yes, Doctor, I'll work with them.

645
01:25:46,133 --> 01:25:47,361
Tighter.

646
01:25:54,208 --> 01:25:56,073
Don't you faint on me.

647
01:25:57,077 --> 01:25:58,305
I won't.

648
01:25:59,313 --> 01:26:01,508
I asked Mother Mathilde
to let the operating sister...

649
01:26:01,582 --> 01:26:04,380
have something to eat before she came in
the morning, but she won't.

650
01:26:04,451 --> 01:26:06,442
-So if you faint on me--
-I won't faint, Doctor...

651
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:09,956
if you promise not to eat garlic again
the night before an operation.

652
01:26:11,825 --> 01:26:13,349
All right, I promise.

653
01:26:17,965 --> 01:26:19,592
All right, go on.

654
01:27:00,607 --> 01:27:03,804
When you've been at this longer,
I'll explain what I was doing.

655
01:27:03,877 --> 01:27:06,141
Your being the daughter
of Dr. Van der Mal...

656
01:27:06,213 --> 01:27:08,204
I expect you could instruct me.

657
01:27:09,016 --> 01:27:11,951
Please don't mention
my father again, Doctor.

658
01:27:38,712 --> 01:27:40,976
-Good morning, Reverend Mother.
-Good morning.

659
01:27:41,048 --> 01:27:44,074
I wouldn't say their hands are as gentle
as Sister Luke's...

660
01:27:44,151 --> 01:27:45,880
but then whose are?

661
01:27:48,555 --> 01:27:51,251
This is certainly a great step forward.

662
01:27:51,959 --> 01:27:56,396
I'd like to borrow Sister Luke
to organize our boys in the textile mills.

663
01:27:59,066 --> 01:28:01,159
Just a moment, Sister Luke.

664
01:28:09,776 --> 01:28:12,939
I had a telephone call
from the Bishop last night.

665
01:28:13,013 --> 01:28:16,176
He had read your name in the paper
and heard your name on the drums...

666
01:28:16,250 --> 01:28:18,650
about making some innovations here.

667
01:28:18,719 --> 01:28:21,916
He asked me what I knew about it.
I had no answer.

668
01:28:22,456 --> 01:28:25,220
It didn't occur to me to ask for permission.

669
01:28:25,292 --> 01:28:29,558
He also asked me why one of my nuns
was trying to singularize herself.

670
01:28:35,435 --> 01:28:37,665
I've failed you, Reverend Mother.

671
01:28:37,738 --> 01:28:42,334
A superior must know what is happening
in a hospital entrusted to her care.

672
01:28:43,710 --> 01:28:46,110
You have done something very important.

673
01:28:46,179 --> 01:28:48,739
Your only fault
is in not telling me in advance...

674
01:28:48,815 --> 01:28:51,147
and saving me the embarrassment.

675
01:29:13,540 --> 01:29:15,405
-Mama Luke.
-Yes, Emil?

676
01:29:16,076 --> 01:29:18,044
Where are your husbands?

677
01:29:19,212 --> 01:29:21,237
I don't understand, Emil.

678
01:29:21,315 --> 01:29:24,751
Where are the husbands
of the white mamas at the house?

679
01:29:24,818 --> 01:29:26,945
Have you asked Mama Mathilde
about this?

680
01:29:27,020 --> 01:29:29,045
-Yes.
-What did she say?

681
01:29:29,189 --> 01:29:32,056
Something about you all being
the wives of one man.

682
01:29:32,125 --> 01:29:33,922
But I know that can't be right.

683
01:29:33,994 --> 01:29:37,122
Father Andre says it's wrong
to have more than one wife.

684
01:29:37,364 --> 01:29:39,662
Well, it's not easy to explain.

685
01:29:39,733 --> 01:29:43,965
I can understand some of the others
not having husbands, but not you.

686
01:29:44,371 --> 01:29:46,839
The fact is, Emil, I have one.

687
01:29:47,307 --> 01:29:50,401
-Well, I thought you would.
-But he's in Heaven.

688
01:29:50,577 --> 01:29:52,374
I'm sorry, Mama Luke.

689
01:29:52,679 --> 01:29:54,203
I'm very sorry.

690
01:30:12,532 --> 01:30:15,399
Can you do without me
for a few days, Sister?

691
01:30:15,469 --> 01:30:18,461
-What do you mean, Doctor?
-Well, I think we both need a rest.

692
01:30:18,538 --> 01:30:21,507
I'm going up to Lake Kivu
for the weekend to do some fishing.

693
01:30:21,575 --> 01:30:22,667
I see.

694
01:30:22,743 --> 01:30:25,735
Give you a chance
to catch up on your prayers.

695
01:30:28,248 --> 01:30:29,909
If there's an emergency?

696
01:30:29,983 --> 01:30:32,349
Well, send for one of the doctors
in the town.

697
01:30:32,419 --> 01:30:34,683
Keep up the morphine
with the terminal cancer.

698
01:30:34,755 --> 01:30:37,849
But don't touch the dressings
on the skin graft.

699
01:30:38,892 --> 01:30:40,484
You'd better get some rest yourself.

700
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:42,994
I've been working you pretty hard
in the last few months.

701
01:30:43,063 --> 01:30:45,588
I'm all right. Have a fine weekend.

702
01:30:47,501 --> 01:30:49,469
Did you ever go fishing?

703
01:30:52,873 --> 01:30:56,536
It's impossible to talk to somebody
who's not allowed to remember.

704
01:30:56,610 --> 01:30:58,271
See you on Monday.

705
01:31:37,818 --> 01:31:40,150
Sister, the mission just called.

706
01:31:41,354 --> 01:31:45,290
Father Andre has had a bad accident.
They're bringing him here.

707
01:31:45,725 --> 01:31:48,853
See if you can still find Dr. Fortunati,
please, Sister.

708
01:32:00,073 --> 01:32:03,440
Call one of the town doctors
for surgery immediately.

709
01:32:15,055 --> 01:32:17,649
-Is the leg very bad?
-It's shattered.

710
01:32:18,125 --> 01:32:20,525
The doctor will have to amputate.

711
01:32:27,167 --> 01:32:31,160
They can't reach a doctor.
I left one of the boys to keep trying.

712
01:32:34,641 --> 01:32:38,543
In that case, we'll have to do
the best we can to save the leg.

713
01:33:00,433 --> 01:33:04,995
I'd like to save you from the sin of pride,
Sister, but I'm afraid I can't.

714
01:33:05,739 --> 01:33:08,833
This may take nearly a year
to mend completely.

715
01:33:09,643 --> 01:33:12,373
But you've saved the Father and his leg.

716
01:33:20,487 --> 01:33:23,047
Mother Mathilde and Sister Aurelie
assisted me.

717
01:33:23,123 --> 01:33:27,287
Yes, and all the other nuns praying
for you back at the Mother House. I know.

718
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:29,692
But you were the one who did it.

719
01:33:40,407 --> 01:33:43,535
It's a photograph of a final x-ray
of Father Andre's leg.

720
01:33:43,610 --> 01:33:47,137
It's just to remind you
what an excellent nurse you are.

721
01:33:49,849 --> 01:33:51,180
Mother Mathilde's making a trip...

722
01:33:51,251 --> 01:33:53,549
up the river next month
to visit the bush stations.

723
01:33:53,620 --> 01:33:55,178
I'm going to send you along, too...

724
01:33:55,255 --> 01:33:58,691
to make the annual leprosy check
on Father Vermeuhlen.

725
01:33:59,192 --> 01:34:01,717
-I see you don't know about him.
-No.

726
01:34:02,562 --> 01:34:06,020
Well, he's known as
the White Saint of the Leper Colony.

727
01:34:06,099 --> 01:34:07,760
The trip will do you good.

728
01:34:07,834 --> 01:34:09,995
And meeting Father Vermeuhlen will, too.

729
01:34:10,070 --> 01:34:13,130
Religion hasn't made him
tense and disciplined.

730
01:34:16,142 --> 01:34:20,135
-A nun is a disciplined person.
-Yes, but not necessarily tense.

731
01:34:20,413 --> 01:34:23,211
As a surgeon, it's not my business
to probe into the mind...

732
01:34:23,283 --> 01:34:27,413
but I'd say that tension is a sign
of an exhausting inner struggle.

733
01:34:31,758 --> 01:34:33,419
The Grand Silence?

734
01:34:35,462 --> 01:34:37,987
Do you realize
that every time you talk to me like this...

735
01:34:38,064 --> 01:34:42,296
I should go down on my knees
before my sisters and proclaim my fault?

736
01:34:46,906 --> 01:34:48,237
I'm sorry.

737
01:35:56,910 --> 01:35:58,935
There's Father Vermeuhlen.

738
01:36:08,054 --> 01:36:11,387
Father Vermeuhlen was
one of the first missionaries in the Congo.

739
01:36:11,458 --> 01:36:13,756
He lived all alone in the bush.

740
01:36:14,060 --> 01:36:17,257
One day he disappeared,
they thought he was dead.

741
01:36:17,564 --> 01:36:20,931
But years later they found him.
Living with a native.

742
01:36:21,534 --> 01:36:23,229
As penance for his sins...

743
01:36:23,303 --> 01:36:27,000
he asked to be allowed to devote
the rest of his life to the lepers.

744
01:37:53,059 --> 01:37:55,994
Well, I'll show you the rest of the station.

745
01:38:04,938 --> 01:38:08,396
It's a makeshift,
but at least they're being cared for.

746
01:38:08,475 --> 01:38:12,639
If left in the forest with their tribes,
they'd be abandoned to die.

747
01:38:12,946 --> 01:38:15,346
Do they realize how ill they are?

748
01:38:15,648 --> 01:38:18,947
Somehow we're all of us
protected from full realization.

749
01:38:19,285 --> 01:38:21,150
How's that rascal Fortunati?

750
01:38:21,221 --> 01:38:23,712
He gave me complete instructions
about you.

751
01:38:23,790 --> 01:38:25,815
All the tests I must make.

752
01:38:26,659 --> 01:38:28,854
Well, we can forget about the tests.

753
01:38:29,329 --> 01:38:33,527
I know they're a nuisance,
but that is the real reason for our trip.

754
01:38:39,472 --> 01:38:42,407
He always said
it was just a matter of time.

755
01:39:39,632 --> 01:39:42,157
Reverend Mother, I'm sorry to ask again...

756
01:39:42,235 --> 01:39:44,829
but may I have permission
to be absent from vespers?

757
01:39:44,904 --> 01:39:47,134
There are some slides I must--

758
01:39:47,607 --> 01:39:49,404
Thank you, Reverend Mother.

759
01:40:31,751 --> 01:40:34,185
What are we going to do about you?

760
01:40:35,488 --> 01:40:37,149
We operated at 5:00 in the morning.

761
01:40:37,223 --> 01:40:40,590
It's now after midnight
and we operate again at 5:00.

762
01:40:42,195 --> 01:40:43,685
I'll be there.

763
01:40:43,997 --> 01:40:46,727
But how many more days
will you be there?

764
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:49,693
What'll I do if you're not?

765
01:40:54,807 --> 01:40:58,334
You comfort your patients
by listening to their troubles.

766
01:40:58,411 --> 01:41:00,208
Who listens to yours?

767
01:41:01,714 --> 01:41:04,979
I'm responsible for the health
of the patients in this hospital.

768
01:41:05,051 --> 01:41:07,042
And for your health, too.

769
01:41:07,654 --> 01:41:09,178
You go to bed.

770
01:42:02,709 --> 01:42:05,542
I don't know what to do, Doctor. I have TB.

771
01:42:07,080 --> 01:42:08,479
Who says so?

772
01:42:10,049 --> 01:42:11,710
Who told you that?

773
01:42:11,818 --> 01:42:13,479
I just made a test.

774
01:42:13,553 --> 01:42:16,021
It will mean my going back to Europe.

775
01:42:16,089 --> 01:42:18,922
But you're the only one
in the whole Congo I can work with.

776
01:42:18,991 --> 01:42:20,618
I can't lose you.

777
01:42:23,730 --> 01:42:25,425
Let's have a look.

778
01:42:25,898 --> 01:42:27,957
I'm not allowed.
I should call another sister.

779
01:42:28,034 --> 01:42:29,695
Let's have a look.

780
01:42:57,997 --> 01:42:59,328
I'm ready.

781
01:43:01,267 --> 01:43:04,634
You're never wrong,
but let's hope this time you are.

782
01:43:12,044 --> 01:43:13,773
Take a deep breath.

783
01:43:19,519 --> 01:43:20,884
And again.

784
01:43:25,424 --> 01:43:26,823
And again.

785
01:43:30,997 --> 01:43:32,328
And again.

786
01:43:37,870 --> 01:43:39,201
Now cough.

787
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:42,068
Breathe.

788
01:43:46,279 --> 01:43:47,439
Cough.

789
01:43:49,081 --> 01:43:50,309
Breathe.

790
01:44:00,026 --> 01:44:01,493
We're lucky, Sister.

791
01:44:01,561 --> 01:44:05,361
It's a small summit lesion,
and I think we've got it in time.

792
01:44:15,775 --> 01:44:17,936
You can stand the gold treatment.

793
01:44:18,010 --> 01:44:20,376
It's a bit rough on the kidneys,
but you're strong.

794
01:44:20,446 --> 01:44:22,641
I'll take the responsibility.

795
01:44:22,849 --> 01:44:25,613
-I'll have to tell Mother Mathilde.
-Why?

796
01:44:26,352 --> 01:44:28,479
Obedience. I must.

797
01:44:28,588 --> 01:44:30,920
They'll send you home if you do.

798
01:44:38,497 --> 01:44:39,725
I know.

799
01:44:42,668 --> 01:44:47,037
You're afraid you won't be able to
stand the convent if they send you back.

800
01:44:48,608 --> 01:44:51,076
I'm going to tell you
something about yourself, Sister.

801
01:44:51,143 --> 01:44:54,340
I've never worked with any other kind
of nurse except nuns since I began.

802
01:44:54,413 --> 01:44:57,849
And you're not in the mold, Sister.
You never will be.

803
01:44:58,751 --> 01:45:00,912
You're what's called a worldly nun.

804
01:45:01,120 --> 01:45:03,520
ldeal for the public, ideal for the patients.

805
01:45:03,589 --> 01:45:06,956
But you see things your own way.
You stick to your own ideas.

806
01:45:07,026 --> 01:45:11,190
You'll never be the kind of nun
that your convent expects you to be.

807
01:45:11,264 --> 01:45:13,061
That's your illness.

808
01:45:13,199 --> 01:45:15,099
The TB is a byproduct.

809
01:45:17,670 --> 01:45:20,605
I can cure the byproduct,
if you want me to.

810
01:45:22,041 --> 01:45:23,565
I want to stay.

811
01:45:24,343 --> 01:45:26,038
All right, leave it to me.

812
01:45:26,112 --> 01:45:29,946
I'll tell the Mother Superior in such a way
that she can't send you home.

813
01:45:30,016 --> 01:45:31,916
We'll put you up in the little pavilion...

814
01:45:31,984 --> 01:45:34,475
where you'll be sleeping
practically in the treetops.

815
01:45:34,553 --> 01:45:37,351
-How long?
-Five, six months, perhaps.

816
01:45:38,124 --> 01:45:40,718
But remember,
I'm only working on the byproduct.

817
01:45:40,793 --> 01:45:43,318
The main illness is for you to cure.

818
01:45:45,498 --> 01:45:46,760
I'll try.

819
01:45:49,335 --> 01:45:53,396
Anything you knew before I did,
keep under your bonnet if you can.

820
01:45:56,943 --> 01:45:58,638
That is, unless your pride...

821
01:45:58,711 --> 01:46:02,442
as a genius of the microscope
doesn't get the better of you.

822
01:46:03,950 --> 01:46:06,111
I'll take an x-ray in the morning.

823
01:46:27,807 --> 01:46:29,035
Come in.

824
01:46:33,012 --> 01:46:35,981
His name is Felix and Mother Mathilde
said you might have him.

825
01:46:36,048 --> 01:46:37,242
Really?

826
01:46:38,384 --> 01:46:40,249
Ilunga gave him to me.

827
01:46:40,653 --> 01:46:44,020
I'd rather he'd given me that fetish
from around his neck.

828
01:46:49,962 --> 01:46:53,329
This reminds me of a tree house
that I had when I....

829
01:47:01,407 --> 01:47:03,238
Anything you want, you ask for it.

830
01:47:03,309 --> 01:47:06,369
Because Dr. Fortunati says
you're to be pampered.

831
01:47:06,445 --> 01:47:08,174
Isn't it wonderful?

832
01:47:10,549 --> 01:47:12,176
Thanks for Felix.

833
01:47:56,495 --> 01:47:58,827
Refuse nothing. Ask for nothing.

834
01:48:01,033 --> 01:48:03,866
It's a prairie oyster. Swallow it quickly.

835
01:48:11,444 --> 01:48:15,141
Each night at 10:00 you'll be awakened
with sandwiches and two glasses of wine.

836
01:48:15,214 --> 01:48:16,408
I see.

837
01:48:17,216 --> 01:48:19,707
The drums have already started
passing the word...

838
01:48:19,785 --> 01:48:23,084
so by tomorrow we'll be swamped
with food and drink for Sister Luke.

839
01:48:24,090 --> 01:48:25,421
Don't cry.

840
01:48:27,093 --> 01:48:29,220
Don't think too much. Relax.

841
01:48:30,129 --> 01:48:33,155
Live life as it comes. From day to day.

842
01:48:34,567 --> 01:48:37,468
I want you to drink
as much of this Belgian beer as you can.

843
01:48:37,536 --> 01:48:41,165
Unless you want to come out
of this gold dust cure with ruined kidneys.

844
01:48:41,240 --> 01:48:42,502
How can I drink so much--

845
01:48:42,575 --> 01:48:46,204
It's all right, there's nobody
to see you here except him.

846
01:48:50,783 --> 01:48:52,910
And you know about monkeys.

847
01:48:55,988 --> 01:48:58,786
That's right. It's good to see you laugh.

848
01:49:00,326 --> 01:49:02,351
You keep laughing, Sister.

849
01:49:03,696 --> 01:49:04,890
I will.

850
01:49:09,101 --> 01:49:12,332
I said rest. Absolute rest.

851
01:49:41,600 --> 01:49:43,261
Thank you, Mother.

852
01:49:45,104 --> 01:49:48,267
I don't know if I'm well yet,
but I feel so well.

853
01:49:48,374 --> 01:49:50,103
So completely well.

854
01:49:50,442 --> 01:49:53,900
It's strange that I had to fall ill to learn
to take each day and each night...

855
01:49:53,979 --> 01:49:57,073
as a gift from God. Without struggle.

856
01:49:57,550 --> 01:50:00,576
It seems impossible,
but when I say my culpa to you next...

857
01:50:00,653 --> 01:50:04,612
I don't think I'll have any imperfections
against the Rule to proclaim.

858
01:50:04,690 --> 01:50:08,558
Except that tonight
you talked during the Grand Silence.

859
01:50:25,377 --> 01:50:27,607
That's a whole week of normal.

860
01:50:28,914 --> 01:50:32,782
You're allowed to have pride, Doctor.
Take pride in your cure.

861
01:50:32,985 --> 01:50:34,509
Are you cured?

862
01:50:34,787 --> 01:50:37,654
The slides and the temperature seem to....

863
01:50:39,792 --> 01:50:44,024
-It'll be good to have you back in surgery.
-It'll be good to be useful again.

864
01:50:44,096 --> 01:50:45,495
Don't rush it, Sister.

865
01:50:45,564 --> 01:50:47,759
It's not going to be easy
to return to the community.

866
01:50:47,833 --> 01:50:51,325
Even to this select little gathering
here in the Congo.

867
01:50:55,107 --> 01:50:56,199
I'm going to miss this.

868
01:51:00,879 --> 01:51:02,005
Well.

869
01:51:22,167 --> 01:51:23,862
At least he's curious.

870
01:51:23,936 --> 01:51:27,372
If I could only get him
into the chapel Christmas Eve.

871
01:51:31,710 --> 01:51:34,338
Well, what do you think of it, Ilunga?

872
01:51:36,081 --> 01:51:37,844
It's for the chapel.

873
01:51:38,951 --> 01:51:40,441
Christmas Eve.

874
01:51:46,558 --> 01:51:49,254
Come in. Come in and have a look at it.

875
01:52:02,341 --> 01:52:04,332
I'm afraid not this year.

876
01:52:06,278 --> 01:52:09,213
I would give anything
if I could convert him.

877
01:52:34,440 --> 01:52:36,499
You spoil them, Sister.

878
01:52:36,875 --> 01:52:39,742
It's one of our building boys
who's come for first aid.

879
01:52:39,812 --> 01:52:43,213
You think if you bandage their fingers,
you'll get their souls.

880
01:52:43,282 --> 01:52:45,273
Well, maybe you're right.

881
01:52:46,785 --> 01:52:48,412
No, inside. Dispensary.

882
01:52:50,889 --> 01:52:52,083
No, inside.

883
01:53:48,947 --> 01:53:50,915
Ilunga, help me lift her.

884
01:53:52,317 --> 01:53:53,716
Ilunga.

885
01:53:58,390 --> 01:54:00,585
She is dead, Reverend Mother.

886
01:54:25,617 --> 01:54:26,845
Ilunga.

887
01:54:30,055 --> 01:54:33,991
If you're on your way to contagion,
please take these to Sister Raphael.

888
01:54:42,801 --> 01:54:44,996
-I don't understand.
-What?

889
01:54:45,137 --> 01:54:46,866
You're not angry with us?

890
01:54:46,972 --> 01:54:50,464
-There's no place in our hearts for anger.
-But this killing, Mama Luke.

891
01:54:50,542 --> 01:54:52,032
Not even then.

892
01:54:53,479 --> 01:54:55,470
Why did he do it, Ilunga?

893
01:54:55,581 --> 01:54:58,414
A witch doctor told him
that if he killed a white woman...

894
01:54:58,484 --> 01:55:01,317
he'd be rid of the ghost of his dead wife.

895
01:55:02,154 --> 01:55:03,781
I feel sorry for him.

896
01:55:03,856 --> 01:55:05,448
If such a death happened with us...

897
01:55:05,524 --> 01:55:08,288
we'd tie the murderer to a stake
and cut his body for fish bait.

898
01:55:08,360 --> 01:55:11,295
But we would not.
We've been taught to forgive.

899
01:55:11,363 --> 01:55:15,129
That's what you must try
and make the other boys understand.

900
01:55:23,976 --> 01:55:27,878
Tell the boys we hope they'll all come
to chapel Christmas Eve.

901
01:55:29,848 --> 01:55:31,748
Maybe even you, Ilunga.

902
01:57:41,113 --> 01:57:44,480
Sometime this afternoon
we'll discus the Englebert case.

903
01:57:44,549 --> 01:57:47,541
I want to give you instructions for the trip.

904
01:57:47,786 --> 01:57:50,949
-The trip?
-Yes. Hasn't Mother Mathilde told you?

905
01:57:51,189 --> 01:57:52,315
What?

906
01:57:52,624 --> 01:57:56,355
I have to send you back to Belgium.
With the Englebert case.

907
01:58:00,265 --> 01:58:04,326
You are the only one qualified.
The only one we can possibly send.

908
01:58:04,703 --> 01:58:06,694
He is important to the colony.

909
01:58:06,772 --> 01:58:09,332
And we can only avoid
a complete mental breakdown...

910
01:58:09,408 --> 01:58:12,741
if we get him to a sanitarium
with proper facilities.

911
01:58:12,811 --> 01:58:14,403
Of course, Mother.

912
01:58:14,479 --> 01:58:18,575
I hope the Mother House
will return you to us as soon as possible.

913
01:58:18,884 --> 01:58:21,250
In the meantime, at long last...

914
01:58:21,653 --> 01:58:26,056
they are sending me another sister
with qualifications similar to yours.

915
01:58:28,860 --> 01:58:32,387
Dr. Fortunati will give you instructions
about the case.

916
01:58:32,564 --> 01:58:34,429
We shall all miss you.

917
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:38,936
You'll have native guards to help you
on the train as far as the coast.

918
01:58:39,004 --> 01:58:42,030
After that, the ship's doctor
will share the responsibility.

919
01:58:42,107 --> 01:58:45,770
I'll give you a supply of sedatives
in case he needs them.

920
01:58:45,977 --> 01:58:48,707
Do you think they'll send you back here?

921
01:58:48,780 --> 01:58:50,270
I don't know.

922
01:58:50,916 --> 01:58:53,908
-There's going to be a war in Europe.
-I know.

923
01:58:56,054 --> 01:58:59,888
They tell me somebody else is coming out
to fill in for you or take your place.

924
01:58:59,958 --> 01:59:02,188
-Yes.
-Somebody else will have to train her.

925
01:59:02,260 --> 01:59:05,320
I'm taking a long vacation
when you leave here.

926
01:59:07,499 --> 01:59:08,989
I couldn't help it.

927
01:59:09,067 --> 01:59:12,764
Englebert's an important man.
There was nobody else, I had to send you.

928
01:59:12,838 --> 01:59:14,305
I understand.

929
01:59:14,573 --> 01:59:18,532
I wish I could keep you here.
As much for your sake as for mine.

930
01:59:20,679 --> 01:59:23,773
Supposing they keep you
indefinitely in Belgium?

931
01:59:24,683 --> 01:59:27,743
You seem so sure
of your religious strength, but I'm not.

932
01:59:27,819 --> 01:59:31,983
Once you set foot in the Mother House,
the walls, the discipline, the silence--

933
01:59:32,057 --> 01:59:34,525
Will you indicate the dosage
for the sedatives?

934
01:59:34,593 --> 01:59:38,029
But if they keep you indefinitely,
will the strength be enough?

935
01:59:38,096 --> 01:59:39,188
Yes.

936
01:59:39,865 --> 01:59:42,527
You're sure it's not
that ferocious will of yours?

937
01:59:42,601 --> 01:59:43,829
I'm sure.

938
01:59:43,902 --> 01:59:46,564
But when you get there,
you're going to wish that you--

939
01:59:46,638 --> 01:59:49,869
Doctor, a nun is not a person
who wishes or desires.

940
01:59:49,941 --> 01:59:51,932
But you're going to feel that you can't....

941
01:59:52,010 --> 01:59:55,241
When you're ready to discuss the case,
please ring for me.

942
02:00:15,367 --> 02:00:17,961
I'm coming back, you beautiful thing.

943
02:00:19,671 --> 02:00:21,798
Do you hear me? I'm coming back.

944
02:01:06,084 --> 02:01:07,813
Come in, Mama Luke.

945
02:01:12,390 --> 02:01:13,982
This is for you.

946
02:01:22,300 --> 02:01:24,063
Tell them thank you.

947
02:03:27,625 --> 02:03:31,721
-How is your health, my child?
-Very good, thank you, Reverend Mother.

948
02:03:31,796 --> 02:03:34,424
So many fine letters
from colonial families...

949
02:03:34,499 --> 02:03:37,229
and missionary fathers
about your good work.

950
02:03:37,302 --> 02:03:39,964
You were liked and respected
by everyone out there...

951
02:03:40,038 --> 02:03:42,472
including your native boys, I see.

952
02:03:43,141 --> 02:03:45,974
Do you wish me to give it to your father?

953
02:03:47,512 --> 02:03:51,073
I would rather it be kept in
the congregation to which it belongs.

954
02:03:51,149 --> 02:03:52,946
When I return to....

955
02:03:53,551 --> 02:03:56,611
When I leave here, it will be good to know
it is in the Mother House.

956
02:03:56,688 --> 02:03:58,918
That is very generous of you.

957
02:03:59,257 --> 02:04:03,387
You will be a splendid example
for our postulants and novices here.

958
02:04:03,728 --> 02:04:06,629
And I think they will be good for you, too.

959
02:04:06,798 --> 02:04:10,666
The more we are looked to for example,
the better examples we become.

960
02:04:10,735 --> 02:04:14,171
-Don't you find that true?
-Yes, Reverend Mother.

961
02:04:14,239 --> 02:04:16,833
So, you will stay here with us then.

962
02:04:17,442 --> 02:04:19,501
Now, you must have a good rest.

963
02:04:19,577 --> 02:04:21,704
You must not worry about anything.

964
02:04:21,780 --> 02:04:24,476
Simply enjoy being home again.

965
02:04:25,050 --> 02:04:27,245
Couldn't I help at the hospital,
Reverend Mother?

966
02:04:27,318 --> 02:04:29,616
No, my child, not now.

967
02:04:30,021 --> 02:04:33,855
You must have a few quiet months
to renew your spiritual life.

968
02:04:37,462 --> 02:04:40,158
This will look very nice in our museum.

969
02:04:54,379 --> 02:04:55,505
Gaby.

970
02:05:01,553 --> 02:05:03,316
You look thin, Gaby.

971
02:05:05,323 --> 02:05:08,417
-You always say that, Father.
-It's always true.

972
02:05:09,661 --> 02:05:11,128
No, it isn't.

973
02:05:12,397 --> 02:05:13,796
Of course...

974
02:05:14,199 --> 02:05:18,033
I don't believe that rubbish about
your having had TB in the Congo.

975
02:05:18,103 --> 02:05:19,900
Don't believe it then.

976
02:05:19,971 --> 02:05:23,463
One just doesn't survive
and have TB in the tropics.

977
02:05:23,875 --> 02:05:25,206
Here I am.

978
02:05:28,313 --> 02:05:30,543
You must've had a good doctor.

979
02:05:30,815 --> 02:05:32,214
Exceptional.

980
02:05:37,989 --> 02:05:41,618
I suppose they'll be sending you back
after a little rest?

981
02:05:42,393 --> 02:05:43,690
I don't know.

982
02:05:43,761 --> 02:05:45,558
If there's not a war.

983
02:05:46,064 --> 02:05:48,897
They talked about nothing else
on the boat.

984
02:05:50,668 --> 02:05:52,761
Your brother's in the army.

985
02:05:52,971 --> 02:05:55,496
-Little Pierre?
-Oh, it's big Pierre.

986
02:05:56,174 --> 02:05:59,075
Your sisters?husbands
are in the army, too.

987
02:05:59,144 --> 02:06:02,341
Marie and Louise
will come to see you soon.

988
02:06:04,249 --> 02:06:06,046
There can't be a war.

989
02:06:09,487 --> 02:06:11,512
How are you, really, Gaby?

990
02:06:12,790 --> 02:06:16,089
I'm very well, Father.
Would you like to see the x-rays?

991
02:06:16,161 --> 02:06:17,685
I mean in here.

992
02:06:19,430 --> 02:06:21,227
How are you in there?

993
02:06:21,733 --> 02:06:23,758
Still very lonely for you.

994
02:06:26,771 --> 02:06:30,730
You know, Jean never married.

995
02:06:32,410 --> 02:06:35,004
Father, you're an incurable romantic.

996
02:06:35,113 --> 02:06:37,547
Jean isn't in my thoughts anymore.

997
02:06:43,121 --> 02:06:46,454
I finally had to take a hand
in training your successor...

998
02:06:46,524 --> 02:06:48,719
but she'll never replace you.

999
02:06:49,127 --> 02:06:51,254
She has no rebellion in her.

1000
02:06:51,629 --> 02:06:53,563
That girl was born to be a nun...

1001
02:06:53,631 --> 02:06:57,692
something you could never be
in a thousand years, Reverend Sister.

1002
02:06:58,036 --> 02:07:01,096
You're not in love with him,
are you, my child?

1003
02:07:01,806 --> 02:07:05,264
No, Mother, of course
I've not fallen in love with him.

1004
02:07:05,343 --> 02:07:08,073
I admire him deeply
for his skill and selflessness...

1005
02:07:08,146 --> 02:07:10,546
when there is a life to be saved.

1006
02:07:10,882 --> 02:07:12,975
I think always he's very close to God...

1007
02:07:13,051 --> 02:07:15,849
in those unearthly hours
when he operates.

1008
02:07:27,098 --> 02:07:30,932
Dear Lord,
help me to detach from these memories.

1009
02:07:31,603 --> 02:07:35,664
How can I be a good nun
if I cannot get the Congo out of my blood?

1010
02:07:41,346 --> 02:07:44,679
Suppose you're detained
in the Mother House indefinitely?

1011
02:07:44,749 --> 02:07:47,183
Will your strength be enough then?

1012
02:08:00,598 --> 02:08:03,726
Ordinarily, I would advise you
to go on a retreat...

1013
02:08:03,801 --> 02:08:06,326
to try to regain your inner silence.

1014
02:08:07,138 --> 02:08:09,936
I have done nothing
but pray and meditate.

1015
02:08:10,541 --> 02:08:14,978
Many years ago, I came back from
the missions to the quiet of this house.

1016
02:08:15,847 --> 02:08:17,974
I know what you are feeling.

1017
02:08:18,549 --> 02:08:21,347
There can be no comparison,
Reverend Mother.

1018
02:08:21,419 --> 02:08:24,820
I've been remembering you especially
in my prayers...

1019
02:08:25,223 --> 02:08:28,124
knowing the agony
you've been going through.

1020
02:08:28,760 --> 02:08:32,389
For weeks, each tap on my door,
I thought it would be you.

1021
02:08:35,166 --> 02:08:38,966
I know it would have been the greater
perfection to have stayed here quietly.

1022
02:08:39,037 --> 02:08:41,562
And the greater danger in your case.

1023
02:08:43,041 --> 02:08:46,568
I can't send you back to the Congo
with the talk of war.

1024
02:08:51,883 --> 02:08:55,546
But there is an important post
as Assistant in Surgery...

1025
02:08:55,620 --> 02:08:58,282
at our hospital on the Holland border.

1026
02:08:58,356 --> 02:09:00,449
Thank you, Reverend Mother.

1027
02:09:17,742 --> 02:09:22,145
I have just received a telephone call
from our Reverend Mother Emmanuel.

1028
02:09:22,847 --> 02:09:25,543
"At 3:00 a.m. Rotterdam was bombarded...

1029
02:09:26,317 --> 02:09:28,217
"many thousands killed.

1030
02:09:29,053 --> 02:09:31,385
"Belgium was bombarded at 5:00.

1031
02:09:32,824 --> 02:09:35,691
"The country's system of sluices
had been put into operation...

1032
02:09:35,760 --> 02:09:40,424
"and certain main roads are already blown
up to prevent the German advances."

1033
02:09:41,999 --> 02:09:44,832
I tell you this
only that you will be prepared.

1034
02:09:44,902 --> 02:09:47,962
Our work must go on
as if nothing has happened.

1035
02:09:48,239 --> 02:09:52,733
It will be your responsibility
to set the example of courage and calm.

1036
02:09:53,444 --> 02:09:57,346
And to retain in your hearts
the spirit of charity for all.

1037
02:09:58,015 --> 02:10:00,347
Even the enemies of our country.

1038
02:10:32,817 --> 02:10:35,684
"Brussels fell to the enemy today.

1039
02:10:36,754 --> 02:10:39,279
"All of Holland is in German hands.

1040
02:10:40,892 --> 02:10:43,156
"The Maginot Line has fallen...

1041
02:10:43,461 --> 02:10:46,021
"and Northern France has been occupied."

1042
02:10:50,601 --> 02:10:53,536
"The Belgian Army,
the British Expeditionary Forces...

1043
02:10:53,604 --> 02:10:55,504
"and the Ninth French Army...

1044
02:10:55,573 --> 02:10:58,201
"are fighting with their
backs to the sea at Dunkirk."

1045
02:11:05,082 --> 02:11:07,607
King Leopold has signed a surrender.

1046
02:11:08,519 --> 02:11:12,353
He asks the population to behave
with dignity and discipline.

1047
02:11:13,124 --> 02:11:15,957
The sisters are urged not to take sides...

1048
02:11:16,294 --> 02:11:20,788
and not to participate in any activity
against the forces of occupation...

1049
02:11:21,165 --> 02:11:24,760
so that the orderly life
of the community is not disturbed...

1050
02:11:24,836 --> 02:11:28,465
and so that our hospital work
may go on without confusion.

1051
02:11:53,931 --> 02:11:56,798
I can only say again, monsieur,
that Mademoiselle Lisa...

1052
02:11:56,868 --> 02:11:59,769
cannot accept telephone calls
while on duty.

1053
02:12:05,409 --> 02:12:08,378
All right, Father, just a moment.

1054
02:12:24,662 --> 02:12:27,096
Someone who says he's Father John.

1055
02:12:45,850 --> 02:12:49,342
Sister Luke, may I have permission
to go into town for an hour?

1056
02:12:49,420 --> 02:12:51,047
My uncle is sick.

1057
02:13:10,474 --> 02:13:14,103
Now, Lisa, you've used that
"sick uncle" excuse twice in the last week.

1058
02:13:14,178 --> 02:13:15,645
-Have I?
-Yes.

1059
02:13:16,047 --> 02:13:18,982
-I have to go, Sister.
-Then tell me why.

1060
02:13:19,050 --> 02:13:20,984
You say you want to become a nun.

1061
02:13:21,052 --> 02:13:24,681
Well, one of the first things to learn
is obedience to....

1062
02:13:30,661 --> 02:13:34,722
We are hiding our soldiers who escaped.
We're hoping to get them to England.

1063
02:13:34,966 --> 02:13:37,366
-The underground--
-That's enough.

1064
02:13:37,535 --> 02:13:40,595
-Your brother may be one of the boys--
-Please.

1065
02:13:43,074 --> 02:13:44,541
I have to go.

1066
02:13:50,715 --> 02:13:52,205
Please, may I?

1067
02:13:52,717 --> 02:13:55,151
If ever I can be of help, tell me.

1068
02:13:56,454 --> 02:13:57,614
Hurry.

1069
02:14:02,493 --> 02:14:04,723
Did you mean that, about help?

1070
02:14:16,907 --> 02:14:19,842
Dear Lord, forgive me,
I cannot obey anymore.

1071
02:14:20,544 --> 02:14:23,741
What I do from now on
is between You and me alone.

1072
02:14:41,465 --> 02:14:44,059
I have a letter for you, Sister Luke.

1073
02:14:46,337 --> 02:14:48,601
Then I'll have to show it
to Mother Superior.

1074
02:14:48,673 --> 02:14:49,833
Don't.

1075
02:16:17,995 --> 02:16:20,259
If such a death happened with us,
Mama Luke...

1076
02:16:20,331 --> 02:16:24,199
we'd tie the murderer to a stake
and cut his body for fish bait.

1077
02:16:24,268 --> 02:16:27,431
But we would not.
We have been taught to forgive.

1078
02:16:41,886 --> 02:16:43,251
Oh, Father!

1079
02:17:02,072 --> 02:17:04,802
Father, I no longer belong in a convent.

1080
02:17:06,744 --> 02:17:08,974
Why do you say that, my child?

1081
02:17:09,213 --> 02:17:11,909
I am a hypocrite in the religious life.

1082
02:17:12,516 --> 02:17:15,781
I wear the habit of obedience,
but I flout the Rule.

1083
02:17:17,454 --> 02:17:20,514
I wear the cross of Christ
above a heart filled with hate.

1084
02:17:20,591 --> 02:17:24,391
You must try, my child.
These times are sent to test us.

1085
02:17:26,130 --> 02:17:28,758
I wonder if I'm even a good Christian.

1086
02:17:28,999 --> 02:17:32,366
When I think of my father,
I can't forgive the enemy.

1087
02:17:33,938 --> 02:17:36,372
And this is only one of my faults.

1088
02:17:36,440 --> 02:17:40,274
You must pray to God
to deliver you from revenge in the heart.

1089
02:17:40,611 --> 02:17:43,205
Today, a German war nurse died here...

1090
02:17:43,781 --> 02:17:46,511
and try as I would, I couldn't regret it.

1091
02:17:47,184 --> 02:17:50,711
My whole lifework
has been dedicated to saving lives...

1092
02:17:51,288 --> 02:17:53,153
and I almost rejoiced.

1093
02:17:53,591 --> 02:17:55,821
Perhaps it is too much to ask.

1094
02:17:56,994 --> 02:17:59,189
Father, I don't believe that.

1095
02:17:59,296 --> 02:18:01,321
It is not too much to ask.

1096
02:18:03,434 --> 02:18:05,334
I simply cannot obey...

1097
02:18:06,036 --> 02:18:10,370
-and if I cannot obey, then--
-You're so hard on yourself, my child.

1098
02:18:12,042 --> 02:18:15,102
Father, please lay my case
before the Cardinal.

1099
02:18:17,781 --> 02:18:19,578
I am no longer a nun.

1100
02:18:21,685 --> 02:18:24,415
You solemnly promised
to obey unto death.

1101
02:18:26,023 --> 02:18:29,220
You should seek God's pleasure
and your own joy...

1102
02:18:29,393 --> 02:18:31,725
in keeping faith with your vows.

1103
02:18:32,663 --> 02:18:35,757
Sacrifice is the only test
to thy love of God.

1104
02:18:38,302 --> 02:18:41,237
You will make a novena
to our Blessed Virgin.

1105
02:18:42,406 --> 02:18:44,431
She always works miracles.

1106
02:18:45,209 --> 02:18:46,972
Haven't you noticed?

1107
02:18:53,250 --> 02:18:55,878
All right, Father, because you ask me.

1108
02:19:01,592 --> 02:19:05,358
Reverend Mother Emmanuel
is paying a visit in a week's time.

1109
02:19:06,563 --> 02:19:08,758
Please wait and speak to her.

1110
02:19:09,199 --> 02:19:11,793
I do not want to see Mother Emmanuel.

1111
02:19:12,670 --> 02:19:15,764
Are you afraid
she'll dissuade you from leaving?

1112
02:19:16,206 --> 02:19:17,696
It isn't that.

1113
02:19:18,776 --> 02:19:21,074
Please lay my case before the Cardinal.

1114
02:19:21,145 --> 02:19:23,443
Won't you wait a little longer?

1115
02:19:24,448 --> 02:19:26,439
Father, you must forgive me...

1116
02:19:26,517 --> 02:19:29,350
but if you do not put my case
before the Cardinal...

1117
02:19:29,420 --> 02:19:31,911
I should do something that would kill me.

1118
02:19:31,989 --> 02:19:34,389
I shall leave without permission.

1119
02:19:59,316 --> 02:20:02,114
Why did you make me ask for you,
my child?

1120
02:20:02,353 --> 02:20:05,754
Didn't you know
that I'd been aware of your struggle?

1121
02:20:06,523 --> 02:20:09,219
It is too late for discussions,
Reverend Mother.

1122
02:20:09,293 --> 02:20:11,261
I'm at the end of my struggles.

1123
02:20:11,328 --> 02:20:13,228
Your sisters love you...

1124
02:20:13,297 --> 02:20:15,197
the doctors trust you...

1125
02:20:15,265 --> 02:20:17,995
and your students
respect you enormously.

1126
02:20:19,603 --> 02:20:21,833
You can cheat your sisters...

1127
02:20:23,007 --> 02:20:25,601
but you cannot cheat yourself or God.

1128
02:20:26,210 --> 02:20:30,647
Have you struggled long enough to say
surely that you've come to the end?

1129
02:20:31,782 --> 02:20:35,616
I think I've been struggling all these years,
Reverend Mother.

1130
02:20:36,820 --> 02:20:40,722
In the beginning, each struggle
seemed different from the one before it.

1131
02:20:40,791 --> 02:20:42,816
But then they began to repeat...

1132
02:20:42,926 --> 02:20:46,123
and I saw
they all had the same core: obedience...

1133
02:20:46,597 --> 02:20:48,258
without question...

1134
02:20:48,332 --> 02:20:50,300
without inner murmuring.

1135
02:20:50,901 --> 02:20:53,802
Perfect obedience as Christ practiced it...

1136
02:20:54,338 --> 02:20:56,067
as I no longer can.

1137
02:20:57,241 --> 02:20:58,299
Yes?

1138
02:21:00,210 --> 02:21:03,509
There are times when my conscience asks
which has priority.

1139
02:21:03,580 --> 02:21:05,377
It or the Holy Rule?

1140
02:21:07,117 --> 02:21:09,176
When the bell calls me to chapel...

1141
02:21:09,253 --> 02:21:12,245
I often have to sacrifice
what might be the decisive moment...

1142
02:21:12,322 --> 02:21:14,756
in a spiritual talk with a patient.

1143
02:21:14,825 --> 02:21:18,090
I'm late every day
for chapel or refectory or both.

1144
02:21:18,695 --> 02:21:21,027
When I have night duty,
I break the Grand Silence...

1145
02:21:21,098 --> 02:21:25,762
because I can no longer cut short a talk
with a patient who seems to need me.

1146
02:21:27,004 --> 02:21:30,770
Mother, why must God's helpers
be struck dumb by five bells...

1147
02:21:30,841 --> 02:21:35,073
in the very hours when men in trouble
want to talk about their souls?

1148
02:21:38,115 --> 02:21:42,142
You entered the convent to be a nun,
not to be a nurse.

1149
02:21:42,753 --> 02:21:47,349
The religious life must be more important
to you than your love of medicine.

1150
02:21:51,995 --> 02:21:54,725
Won't you make one more effort for God?

1151
02:21:55,666 --> 02:21:57,964
And for me as His instrument?

1152
02:22:00,070 --> 02:22:02,300
I have tried, Reverend Mother.

1153
02:22:08,212 --> 02:22:11,943
When I go from here,
I shall take you with me in my heart...

1154
02:22:12,716 --> 02:22:15,742
and keep you each day in my prayers.

1155
02:22:56,026 --> 02:22:58,256
-Lisa.
-Sister.

1156
02:22:59,963 --> 02:23:03,160
Lisa, you often talked
about entering the convent.

1157
02:23:03,233 --> 02:23:05,258
Yes, Sister. I'm going to.

1158
02:23:06,436 --> 02:23:09,997
You're not entering because
of any personal feeling of admiration...

1159
02:23:10,073 --> 02:23:11,700
you might have...

1160
02:23:12,709 --> 02:23:14,609
for any of the sisters?

1161
02:23:15,245 --> 02:23:18,612
No, not really. I don't think so.

1162
02:23:20,784 --> 02:23:24,083
I just wanted to know, Lisa,
because I'm going out.

1163
02:23:26,590 --> 02:23:28,581
I felt you were going to.

1164
02:23:29,660 --> 02:23:31,685
I'm glad you're coming in.

1165
02:23:33,030 --> 02:23:35,498
Is it certain that you're leaving?

1166
02:23:36,300 --> 02:23:37,790
I have asked.

1167
02:23:39,203 --> 02:23:40,830
What happens now?

1168
02:23:42,105 --> 02:23:43,629
I have no idea.

1169
02:23:47,978 --> 02:23:49,639
Here's an address.

1170
02:23:50,647 --> 02:23:52,877
The underground needs nurses.

1171
02:23:55,686 --> 02:23:59,019
-We shall miss you.
-And I shall miss....

1172
02:24:04,695 --> 02:24:07,721
You'll be a fine nun, Lisa. Not a failure.

1173
02:24:22,279 --> 02:24:26,045
As a representative of the Archbishop,
I must ask you, Sister Luke...

1174
02:24:26,116 --> 02:24:29,051
if you are doing this of your own free will?

1175
02:24:29,519 --> 02:24:30,577
Yes.

1176
02:24:31,188 --> 02:24:35,591
Sister, have you really considered
the seriousness of what you're doing?

1177
02:24:36,693 --> 02:24:37,751
Yes.

1178
02:24:44,234 --> 02:24:47,169
There are these three papers
to sign, Sister.

1179
02:24:48,605 --> 02:24:50,971
One copy is for you, one is for us...

1180
02:24:51,041 --> 02:24:53,509
and one is for the papal archives.

1181
02:25:03,387 --> 02:25:05,378
Have you somewhere to go?

1182
02:25:09,393 --> 02:25:10,451
Yes.

1183
02:25:12,763 --> 02:25:15,254
Sister, is there nothing we can do?

1184
02:25:17,567 --> 02:25:18,795
Nothing.

1185
02:26:00,577 --> 02:26:03,205
From here
you will go to the portress?room.

1186
02:26:03,280 --> 02:26:06,010
She will give you further instructions.

1187
02:26:09,319 --> 02:26:11,844
You may leave your keys on my desk.

1188
02:26:26,436 --> 02:26:30,338
And in conclusion, the dowry
your father gave when you entered.

1189
02:26:36,046 --> 02:26:37,673
You must take it.

1190
02:27:56,326 --> 02:27:59,420
Go through here to Room 12.
Everything is ready.

1191
02:27:59,863 --> 02:28:03,321
Press the button when you are finished
and I will open.

1192
02:31:30,340 --> 02:31:31,329
English
