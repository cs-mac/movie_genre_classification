1
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,232
Keep it high.

2
00:01:47,332 --> 00:01:49,401
Babe, you promised we
were gonna get away.

3
00:01:53,338 --> 00:01:58,076
You know I want to. I can't.
Maybe in a couple years.

4
00:01:58,176 --> 00:01:59,912
You're not gonna be
thankful when you're 50

5
00:02:00,012 --> 00:02:01,838
and wasting your life in a cubicle.

6
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,461
You don't feel the same way, I see.

7
00:02:11,488 --> 00:02:13,175
All right, badass.

8
00:02:14,327 --> 00:02:16,679
Come on, you're the only
thing keeping me here.

9
00:02:16,779 --> 00:02:19,265
Come on, I'm done
losing the rat race.

10
00:02:24,203 --> 00:02:27,857
There are things I want in life and
my job helps me get those things.

11
00:02:27,957 --> 00:02:29,817
Babe.

12
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:39,918
Come on, keep it high.

13
00:02:46,934 --> 00:02:48,511
You've never been there.

14
00:02:50,188 --> 00:02:53,599
There's a calm that comes over you.

15
00:02:55,026 --> 00:02:57,804
The water.

16
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,727
We could be the ones.

17
00:03:04,827 --> 00:03:07,781
We could be the ones that got away.

18
00:03:19,093 --> 00:03:21,829
And what about the mortgage?

19
00:03:21,929 --> 00:03:24,123
I just refinanced.

20
00:03:24,223 --> 00:03:26,041
And I have my student loans.

21
00:03:26,141 --> 00:03:28,502
You know how important this job is.

22
00:03:28,602 --> 00:03:30,421
It's a pleasure to be here.

23
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:32,464
Our first question...

24
00:03:32,564 --> 00:03:36,143
Look it. Your real love's here.

25
00:03:37,486 --> 00:03:38,679
You can box with him.

26
00:03:38,779 --> 00:03:41,015
And we want jobs here in America.

27
00:03:41,115 --> 00:03:44,226
You know he's the 38th
richest man in the world?

28
00:03:44,326 --> 00:03:47,521
Yeah, well, if that's rich,
then I don't want to be rich.

29
00:03:47,621 --> 00:03:48,689
Will you stop?

30
00:03:48,789 --> 00:03:50,315
...really hard to get it down,

31
00:03:50,415 --> 00:03:54,069
but our companies are
making huge profits.

32
00:03:54,169 --> 00:03:57,289
And which have you become,
ignorant or apathetic?

33
00:03:59,007 --> 00:04:02,412
I don't know and I don't care.

34
00:04:02,512 --> 00:04:04,748
...only half cheaper

35
00:04:04,848 --> 00:04:06,458
but maybe even a three quarter...

36
00:04:06,558 --> 00:04:08,543
Oh, come on.

37
00:04:08,643 --> 00:04:10,928
It was a joke.

38
00:04:12,814 --> 00:04:14,799
A good one.

39
00:04:16,317 --> 00:04:18,803
People trust our company
and what we do.

40
00:04:18,903 --> 00:04:21,848
And I just hope that I
can always live up to it.

41
00:04:21,948 --> 00:04:24,642
I believe I can because,
not knowingly,

42
00:04:24,742 --> 00:04:28,363
I have never, ever done
anything that's been dishonest.

43
00:04:53,104 --> 00:04:55,391
Left your key card on
your desk again?

44
00:04:56,859 --> 00:04:58,719
I got you.

45
00:04:58,819 --> 00:05:00,304
Thanks.

46
00:05:00,404 --> 00:05:02,264
So, any plans for the 4th?

47
00:05:02,364 --> 00:05:05,101
No plans. I'm just gonna
enjoy the holiday weekend.

48
00:05:05,201 --> 00:05:07,103
Bet you can't wait
to get out of here.

49
00:05:07,203 --> 00:05:10,322
No, working the double shift.
I can use the holiday pay.

50
00:05:13,709 --> 00:05:15,111
Your kids all right?

51
00:05:15,211 --> 00:05:17,738
Yeah, they're fine.

52
00:05:17,838 --> 00:05:20,207
What's with the long face, then?

53
00:05:22,383 --> 00:05:23,985
This is you.

54
00:05:27,556 --> 00:05:30,334
- There you go.
- Okay.

55
00:05:30,434 --> 00:05:32,719
If you need to talk, I'm here.

56
00:05:47,618 --> 00:05:50,113
What's wrong?

57
00:05:52,749 --> 00:05:55,034
Jane.

58
00:05:59,547 --> 00:06:01,491
Something terrible's happened.

59
00:06:01,591 --> 00:06:03,076
What?

60
00:06:03,176 --> 00:06:05,078
This can't be easy to hear,

61
00:06:05,178 --> 00:06:08,665
but they found Mike dead
this morning out front.

62
00:06:08,765 --> 00:06:10,550
What?

63
00:06:12,185 --> 00:06:13,970
How?

64
00:06:15,772 --> 00:06:17,974
Apparently suicide.

65
00:06:23,321 --> 00:06:25,648
He threw himself from
the top of the building.

66
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,444
- Oh, my God.
- I'm sorry.

67
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,110
You okay? I'm so sorry, Jane.

68
00:07:51,536 --> 00:07:53,863
They already packed
all of Mike's stuff.

69
00:07:55,415 --> 00:07:58,151
I can't believe they moved so fast.

70
00:07:58,251 --> 00:08:00,245
What do you expect?

71
00:08:06,551 --> 00:08:08,745
Everyone.

72
00:08:08,845 --> 00:08:12,132
Can you gather around?

73
00:08:21,024 --> 00:08:24,136
As soon as I heard the
very distressing news,

74
00:08:24,236 --> 00:08:28,473
I wanted to be here in
person with you all

75
00:08:28,573 --> 00:08:30,685
at this very difficult time.

76
00:08:30,785 --> 00:08:35,315
We all have a huge hole
in our heart this morning.

77
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:38,151
Especially me.

78
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:42,121
Because not only was
Mike my employee...

79
00:08:43,881 --> 00:08:47,460
he was also my friend.

80
00:08:49,011 --> 00:08:51,331
We are like a family here

81
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:54,167
and we must all stick together.

82
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:57,712
As Winston Churchill said,

83
00:08:57,812 --> 00:09:01,215
"Success is not final.

84
00:09:01,315 --> 00:09:04,135
Failure is not fatal.

85
00:09:04,235 --> 00:09:08,981
It's the courage to
continue that counts."

86
00:09:10,032 --> 00:09:15,396
We will continue Mike's great work.

87
00:09:15,496 --> 00:09:17,448
God bless you all.

88
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:21,736
God bless Mike.

89
00:09:21,836 --> 00:09:23,989
Jane, a word.

90
00:09:24,089 --> 00:09:26,333
Oh, of course.

91
00:09:34,057 --> 00:09:36,710
God.

92
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:41,306
How could a man...

93
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:46,678
It's interesting, isn't it?

94
00:09:46,778 --> 00:09:49,556
This must have been the
last view that he had

95
00:09:49,656 --> 00:09:51,433
before he jumped off the building.

96
00:09:51,533 --> 00:09:53,727
Poor Mike.

97
00:09:53,827 --> 00:09:56,397
You knew him well, didn't you?

98
00:09:56,497 --> 00:09:58,607
Yes, sir.

99
00:09:58,707 --> 00:10:00,992
What was his mindset?

100
00:10:02,503 --> 00:10:04,738
That's just the thing.

101
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:07,908
I never thought Mike would be
capable of something like this.

102
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:11,503
Well, we never know
what we're capable of.

103
00:10:13,347 --> 00:10:16,584
You know, it seems to me, Jane,

104
00:10:16,684 --> 00:10:19,421
you are the ideal candidate

105
00:10:19,521 --> 00:10:22,048
to take over Mike's position.

106
00:10:22,148 --> 00:10:24,509
That hadn't even occurred to me.

107
00:10:24,609 --> 00:10:27,387
Oh, please, don't be coy with me.

108
00:10:27,487 --> 00:10:30,432
This is one great opportunity.

109
00:10:30,532 --> 00:10:33,309
Does that excite you?

110
00:10:33,409 --> 00:10:35,562
With all due respect, sir,

111
00:10:35,662 --> 00:10:38,898
it's difficult to be excited
about anything right now.

112
00:10:38,998 --> 00:10:40,942
Very well.

113
00:10:41,042 --> 00:10:45,246
Remember, time waits for no man.

114
00:11:34,597 --> 00:11:36,965
Oh, more good news.

115
00:11:53,741 --> 00:11:56,644
- Hello?
- Jane, it's Pam.

116
00:11:56,744 --> 00:12:00,314
Oh, my God. Pam, I am so sorry.

117
00:12:00,414 --> 00:12:02,233
I don't know what to say.

118
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,861
I didn't know who else to call.

119
00:12:04,961 --> 00:12:07,989
I just don't understand.

120
00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:10,375
Mike would have never...

121
00:12:11,301 --> 00:12:13,370
What can I do for you?

122
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:18,341
Mike has some photos on his
desk of him and the kids.

123
00:12:19,267 --> 00:12:21,878
I just can't come to the
office and face everyone.

124
00:12:21,978 --> 00:12:24,506
Do you mind getting
them for me, please?

125
00:12:24,606 --> 00:12:26,550
I will grab every photo I see

126
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:28,510
and make sure you get
them right away.

127
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:32,021
I can bring them over to you,
too, if you want some company.

128
00:12:33,948 --> 00:12:37,018
Pam, if there's anything
else that we can do,

129
00:12:37,118 --> 00:12:39,688
me or Ray, please don't
hesitate to ask us.

130
00:12:39,788 --> 00:12:41,731
We're here for you, okay?

131
00:12:41,831 --> 00:12:43,908
Thank you, Jane.

132
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:01,602
Damn it, Colleen.

133
00:16:01,702 --> 00:16:03,562
You can't just barge
in here like that.

134
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:06,940
I know, I'm sorry. I come in peace.

135
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,701
You've got to eat, babe.

136
00:16:11,712 --> 00:16:14,239
- Jane.
- Thank you.

137
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:16,291
I'll eat it.

138
00:16:22,431 --> 00:16:24,633
We have secrets between us now?

139
00:16:27,227 --> 00:16:29,054
You're learning the game.

140
00:17:27,748 --> 00:17:29,867
I didn't think he even liked Mike.

141
00:17:32,962 --> 00:17:34,947
If you think Taft or anybody here

142
00:17:35,047 --> 00:17:37,658
cares about anything but
their own job, you're nuts.

143
00:17:37,758 --> 00:17:40,586
I want his job and he
wants Gault's job.

144
00:17:42,721 --> 00:17:44,874
Did you know what
Mike was working on?

145
00:17:44,974 --> 00:17:47,710
- What he was into?
- Into?

146
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:49,420
- Yeah.
- What was he into?

147
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,347
What is it you think we
do here, cure cancer?

148
00:17:54,024 --> 00:17:57,311
I'm not quite sure what
you're getting at.

149
00:17:59,613 --> 00:18:01,148
What is he doing?

150
00:18:02,783 --> 00:18:06,061
Let me give you the same advice
I got when I started here.

151
00:18:06,161 --> 00:18:08,939
The only way a woman is gonna
get ahead in this boys' club

152
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:12,818
is to keep her head down and be the
biggest bitch on the block, period.

153
00:18:12,918 --> 00:18:15,404
God, who said that?

154
00:18:15,504 --> 00:18:17,539
You did.

155
00:18:25,056 --> 00:18:26,674
My Lord.

156
00:18:43,366 --> 00:18:45,268
This doesn't make sense.

157
00:18:45,368 --> 00:18:47,487
Of all people...

158
00:18:50,373 --> 00:18:52,943
You don't think Mike
was the suicidal type?

159
00:18:53,043 --> 00:18:55,820
I don't know what
the suicidal type is,

160
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,580
but it wasn't Mike.

161
00:19:01,551 --> 00:19:03,086
Then why'd he do it?

162
00:19:09,184 --> 00:19:12,262
I found this taped to the
bottom of Mike's desk.

163
00:19:18,527 --> 00:19:19,887
What is that?

164
00:19:19,987 --> 00:19:21,722
Financial data

165
00:19:21,822 --> 00:19:25,776
that implicates someone in this
company of major embezzlement.

166
00:19:27,578 --> 00:19:30,690
The large pension securities accounts
have been completely depleted.

167
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:33,318
- The amount missing is staggering.
- Stop.

168
00:19:35,336 --> 00:19:37,863
I need you to double-check the files

169
00:19:37,963 --> 00:19:40,324
and be absolutely certain before
you make any accusations.

170
00:19:40,424 --> 00:19:41,993
I already have.

171
00:19:42,093 --> 00:19:44,420
But I'll do it again if you want.

172
00:19:46,764 --> 00:19:48,582
Jane, let's keep this between us.

173
00:19:48,682 --> 00:19:51,127
I don't need to tell you
how serious this is.

174
00:19:51,227 --> 00:19:53,345
What are we gonna do if it's true?

175
00:19:55,147 --> 00:19:58,384
If you have actually have something,

176
00:19:58,484 --> 00:20:00,936
there are procedures.

177
00:20:02,113 --> 00:20:05,566
We'll wait until the office is
empty and we'll call the SEC.

178
00:20:06,617 --> 00:20:08,486
Together.

179
00:20:10,122 --> 00:20:12,733
But I need the proof.

180
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:14,034
Okay.

181
00:20:15,627 --> 00:20:18,038
I'll go get your proof.

182
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:11,959
You're not bailing out on
happy hour again, are you?

183
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:14,045
Oh.

184
00:21:14,145 --> 00:21:16,297
I just have to finish this stuff up.

185
00:21:16,397 --> 00:21:18,925
- Couple more hours.
- You need a drink.

186
00:21:19,025 --> 00:21:20,968
We all do.

187
00:21:21,068 --> 00:21:23,096
I can't.

188
00:21:23,196 --> 00:21:25,556
Can you babysit Ray
for me until I get there?

189
00:21:25,656 --> 00:21:28,935
Are you sure?
You've seen me when I drink.

190
00:21:30,536 --> 00:21:32,772
Then behave yourself
and be a good girl.

191
00:21:32,872 --> 00:21:34,607
Are you serious with this?

192
00:21:34,707 --> 00:21:37,360
I really can't come. I'm sorry.

193
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,487
Okay, just call me
when you finish up.

194
00:21:39,587 --> 00:21:41,414
I will.

195
00:21:59,775 --> 00:22:01,343
Well?

196
00:22:01,443 --> 00:22:03,846
Well, Mike was onto something.

197
00:22:03,946 --> 00:22:07,274
Big. Bad.

198
00:22:08,116 --> 00:22:10,444
- You know, illegal.
- Okay.

199
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:16,024
Get everything ready
for a formal review

200
00:22:16,124 --> 00:22:18,994
and I'll have someone
here in 30 minutes.

201
00:22:22,631 --> 00:22:24,374
It'll be okay.

202
00:22:45,445 --> 00:22:47,681
It's me.

203
00:22:47,781 --> 00:22:51,360
Unfortunately the problem has spread.

204
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:55,865
No, it's beyond my control.

205
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,914
I'll be in the lobby.

206
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:46,700
Hey, babe. How you feeling?

207
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,536
I thought I knew him.

208
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:53,415
Just crazy to think how
someone can be here one day

209
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:56,051
and the next day they're
gone just like that.

210
00:23:58,187 --> 00:24:00,055
I know.

211
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:03,259
I'm sorry, babe. I love you.

212
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:05,135
Can I do anything?

213
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:07,805
No.

214
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:09,265
I don't know.

215
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:11,016
Do you want me to come and get you?

216
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,685
I will come and get you right now.

217
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:14,728
No, please don't do that.

218
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:18,816
I... I have to do this on my own.

219
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,659
Got to do what?

220
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,495
It's nothing to worry about.

221
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:28,158
Anyway, you're gonna be proud of me.

222
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:30,494
I'm always proud of you.

223
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:32,955
I want to take care of you.

224
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:35,841
I'm gonna be fine. I promise.

225
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,795
Colleen's on her way over.

226
00:24:38,895 --> 00:24:41,222
Oh.

227
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:44,217
Okay.

228
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:46,511
I love you, Ray.

229
00:24:46,611 --> 00:24:48,396
I love you.

230
00:25:37,613 --> 00:25:39,156
Let's get this over with.

231
00:25:43,335 --> 00:25:46,405
- We need to see the surveillance room.
- Surveillance room?

232
00:25:46,505 --> 00:25:48,499
Anybody on duty besides you tonight?

233
00:25:49,592 --> 00:25:50,910
It's okay, Lamont. He's with me.

234
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:53,253
Come on, Frank, let's go upstairs.
Let's not waste time here.

235
00:25:55,639 --> 00:25:57,166
Anybody else on duty tonight?

236
00:25:57,266 --> 00:25:59,502
No. Why do you ask?

237
00:25:59,602 --> 00:26:02,262
Let's go to the surveillance room.

238
00:26:03,939 --> 00:26:05,474
Thank you, Lamont.

239
00:26:10,696 --> 00:26:12,056
Right through here.

240
00:26:12,156 --> 00:26:15,476
Wow, look at this place. How long
you been with the company, Lamont?

241
00:26:15,576 --> 00:26:17,770
- Five years.
- Wow, five years.

242
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:20,280
- All the latest gear?
- Yup.

243
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:23,985
- You got a family?
- Yeah, wife and two girls.

244
00:26:24,085 --> 00:26:27,572
Oh. Which ones are
the main video drives?

245
00:26:27,672 --> 00:26:29,408
These two.

246
00:26:29,508 --> 00:26:31,076
This one and this one?

247
00:26:31,176 --> 00:26:32,786
- Yes.
- How old are your girls?

248
00:26:32,886 --> 00:26:34,413
Four and six.

249
00:26:34,513 --> 00:26:37,332
- You got life insurance?
- Life insurance?

250
00:26:37,432 --> 00:26:40,677
I'm gonna need to pull these drives.

251
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:07,654
Jane, this is Frank.

252
00:27:07,754 --> 00:27:11,283
He's one of our crisis managers
here to get us started internally.

253
00:27:11,383 --> 00:27:14,202
A pleasure. We need to
get out in front of this.

254
00:27:14,302 --> 00:27:16,204
These things tend to
accelerate if we don't.

255
00:27:16,304 --> 00:27:18,791
Just a brief interview until
the legal team gets here.

256
00:27:18,891 --> 00:27:21,093
Of course.

257
00:27:29,902 --> 00:27:31,604
Thank you.

258
00:27:33,864 --> 00:27:36,809
- What a view.
- Yeah.

259
00:27:36,909 --> 00:27:38,895
That's what the corner
office gets you.

260
00:27:38,995 --> 00:27:40,229
Yeah.

261
00:27:40,329 --> 00:27:42,264
I'll try to make this as
painless as possible.

262
00:27:42,364 --> 00:27:44,692
I need to get a very
clear understanding

263
00:27:44,792 --> 00:27:47,970
- of what it is you've observed.
- Of course.

264
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:51,240
- Regulations, you understand.
- Okay.

265
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,992
How long have you been
with the company?

266
00:27:53,092 --> 00:27:55,161
- Three years.
- Three years?

267
00:27:55,261 --> 00:27:59,040
And was Mike your
supervisor the entire time?

268
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:02,627
Yes, but he was more
than a supervisor.

269
00:28:02,727 --> 00:28:05,671
He was a mentor.

270
00:28:05,771 --> 00:28:07,965
Kind of like a big brother.

271
00:28:08,065 --> 00:28:11,261
I can only imagine how
difficult this is for you.

272
00:28:11,361 --> 00:28:13,597
I'm so sorry.

273
00:28:13,697 --> 00:28:15,098
Okay, well, tell me
now what you found.

274
00:28:15,198 --> 00:28:17,601
Bullet points. We'll get
to the specifics later.

275
00:28:17,701 --> 00:28:19,653
Of course.

276
00:28:21,288 --> 00:28:22,523
It's not good.

277
00:28:22,623 --> 00:28:25,359
The transfers were made
to overseas accounts

278
00:28:25,459 --> 00:28:27,402
which were practically untraceable.

279
00:28:27,502 --> 00:28:29,029
Wow, those accounts
should have been under

280
00:28:29,129 --> 00:28:30,239
the direct governance
and control of...

281
00:28:30,339 --> 00:28:33,825
Someone who has full
access and authorization.

282
00:28:33,925 --> 00:28:36,828
Well, there can't be many
people on that list.

283
00:28:36,928 --> 00:28:39,089
Did you have a name?

284
00:28:40,223 --> 00:28:42,008
I do.

285
00:28:43,185 --> 00:28:45,345
Who is it?

286
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:50,517
I can't say with absolute certainty.

287
00:28:52,194 --> 00:28:54,354
Who is it?

288
00:28:58,784 --> 00:29:00,360
It's Gault.

289
00:29:05,208 --> 00:29:06,534
Here.

290
00:29:08,711 --> 00:29:10,238
I've checked all the data thoroughly.

291
00:29:10,338 --> 00:29:12,574
He's the only one.

292
00:29:12,674 --> 00:29:14,292
Thaddeus Gault?

293
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:18,129
The man who built the company?

294
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:21,624
Yes.

295
00:29:21,724 --> 00:29:23,876
This is quite explosive, Jane.

296
00:29:23,976 --> 00:29:25,628
I know.

297
00:29:25,728 --> 00:29:27,422
I don't want to take
on a man like that.

298
00:29:27,522 --> 00:29:29,966
That's why you're here.

299
00:29:30,066 --> 00:29:31,509
That's right. That is why I'm here.

300
00:29:31,609 --> 00:29:33,595
But I need to know,
have you discussed this

301
00:29:33,695 --> 00:29:35,763
with anyone else since
making the report?

302
00:29:35,863 --> 00:29:38,558
Phoned anyone?
Received any phone calls?

303
00:29:38,658 --> 00:29:42,145
- Besides Taft, no.
- Are you sure?

304
00:29:42,245 --> 00:29:45,406
Yeah, I'm sure.

305
00:29:48,251 --> 00:29:52,113
Do you think that this may
have had something to do with

306
00:29:52,213 --> 00:29:57,376
your recently departed
colleague's demise?

307
00:29:58,554 --> 00:30:01,590
Yes, I think he's who uncovered it.

308
00:30:06,854 --> 00:30:09,431
Interesting.

309
00:30:15,237 --> 00:30:17,264
- I'm gonna use the restroom.
- Out of the question.

310
00:30:17,364 --> 00:30:18,766
We're almost finished here.

311
00:30:18,866 --> 00:30:20,225
Well, I really need to go.

312
00:30:20,325 --> 00:30:22,353
Sit down.

313
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:25,113
Now.

314
00:30:28,208 --> 00:30:31,745
Copies... yes or no?

315
00:30:32,755 --> 00:30:35,332
Did you make any copies?

316
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:39,662
I don't think it would be in
your best interest to lie...

317
00:31:01,785 --> 00:31:03,520
Who are you?

318
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,480
Copies...

319
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,399
yes or no?

320
00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:09,984
Yes or no?

321
00:31:10,084 --> 00:31:12,036
Yes.

322
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:15,665
I made a copy.

323
00:31:16,883 --> 00:31:19,202
Where is it?

324
00:31:19,302 --> 00:31:22,163
In my friend's cubicle.

325
00:31:22,263 --> 00:31:25,417
I hid it there just in case.

326
00:31:25,517 --> 00:31:27,677
In case of what?

327
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:31,347
Let's go get it.

328
00:32:19,863 --> 00:32:20,981
Frank!

329
00:32:23,242 --> 00:32:24,443
Frank!

330
00:32:33,711 --> 00:32:35,788
Come on.

331
00:32:46,057 --> 00:32:47,425
Come on.

332
00:33:02,574 --> 00:33:04,818
Take the elevator.

333
00:34:16,148 --> 00:34:17,641
No!

334
00:34:28,954 --> 00:34:30,647
Okay, I'm in the room.

335
00:34:30,747 --> 00:34:32,357
- I'm in the room.
- Stop the elevator.

336
00:34:32,457 --> 00:34:36,445
This panel makes
no sense whatsoever.

337
00:34:36,545 --> 00:34:38,739
We're screwed. She's probably
called the cops by now.

338
00:34:38,839 --> 00:34:40,949
I took care of her phone.
Do me a favor.

339
00:34:41,049 --> 00:34:42,734
Don't think, all right?
Just do what I say.

340
00:34:43,034 --> 00:34:44,536
I'm trying.

341
00:34:44,636 --> 00:34:46,713
Stop the elevator.

342
00:35:10,912 --> 00:35:12,405
What?

343
00:35:13,206 --> 00:35:15,075
What?

344
00:35:31,684 --> 00:35:33,719
No. No.

345
00:35:41,069 --> 00:35:44,855
Oh, I think the entire
system's fried.

346
00:36:33,831 --> 00:36:35,907
No.

347
00:36:41,964 --> 00:36:44,958
Yes! Yes. Yes.

348
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:09,893
Damn it!

349
00:37:09,993 --> 00:37:11,978
Mr. Taft, come on.
What's going on here?

350
00:37:12,078 --> 00:37:15,998
I'm so sorry, Lamont. I'm sure
Mr. Gault will approve all of this.

351
00:37:16,698 --> 00:37:17,776
Frank!

352
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:43,559
Frank!

353
00:38:07,801 --> 00:38:09,453
Was that necessary?

354
00:38:09,553 --> 00:38:12,289
You need to get ahold of yourself.
We've got a lot to do.

355
00:38:12,389 --> 00:38:14,591
Now let's go.

356
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:18,629
We need to get into the elevator room

357
00:38:18,729 --> 00:38:20,172
and turn off this alarm.

358
00:38:20,272 --> 00:38:21,841
What about the cops?

359
00:38:21,941 --> 00:38:23,300
It's internal only.

360
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,761
They couldn't hear it unless
there were parked right outside.

361
00:38:25,861 --> 00:38:27,346
We're wasting time.

362
00:38:27,446 --> 00:38:30,566
I need to find one of
those elevator keys.

363
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:42,828
Let's go.

364
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:49,201
Please let someone hear this.

365
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,968
Do you even know where you're going?

366
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:40,378
No. No.

367
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:41,713
No.

368
00:39:41,813 --> 00:39:43,089
No, no, no, no, no.

369
00:39:43,189 --> 00:39:45,926
No.

370
00:39:53,284 --> 00:39:55,394
No. What is...

371
00:39:55,494 --> 00:39:57,988
Emergency call.

372
00:39:59,165 --> 00:40:00,816
Hello?

373
00:40:00,916 --> 00:40:02,568
My name is Jane Porter.

374
00:40:02,668 --> 00:40:04,403
I'm stuck in the
elevator at Gault Tower.

375
00:40:04,503 --> 00:40:07,406
Can anybody hear me?
Can anybody hear me?

376
00:40:07,506 --> 00:40:08,741
Great.

377
00:40:08,841 --> 00:40:11,452
You're supposed to be fixing the
situation, not making it worse.

378
00:40:11,552 --> 00:40:13,955
I am fixing the situation.

379
00:40:14,055 --> 00:40:15,915
I'm cleaning up your mess.

380
00:40:16,015 --> 00:40:18,292
Watch it, Frank.
You may be the muscle,

381
00:40:18,392 --> 00:40:20,086
but I still run things around here.

382
00:40:20,186 --> 00:40:22,012
Don't forget your place.

383
00:40:25,691 --> 00:40:27,385
You're absolutely right.

384
00:40:32,865 --> 00:40:34,100
All right.

385
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,694
How do we get her out?

386
00:40:41,665 --> 00:40:43,402
Cut the elevator cables.

387
00:40:43,502 --> 00:40:46,446
It won't work.
Elevators all have emergency brakes.

388
00:40:46,546 --> 00:40:49,950
All right, well,
how about we burn her out?

389
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:54,079
The sprinkler system will kick on.
There's no guarantee she'd die.

390
00:40:54,179 --> 00:40:56,081
Then turn off the sprinklers.

391
00:40:56,181 --> 00:40:58,500
Look, the fire department will
be here in five minutes, okay?

392
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,243
That's no good.

393
00:41:01,343 --> 00:41:05,674
Okay, well, let's hear some of
your ideas, 'cause I'm fresh out.

394
00:41:07,484 --> 00:41:10,679
Tell me everything you
know about our Jane here.

395
00:41:10,779 --> 00:41:13,473
Husband? Boyfriend?

396
00:41:13,573 --> 00:41:15,517
Significant other?

397
00:41:15,617 --> 00:41:16,977
A boyfriend, I think.

398
00:41:17,077 --> 00:41:19,904
I try not to concern myself
with their private lives.

399
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:24,359
Boyfriend.

400
00:41:24,459 --> 00:41:26,486
Do we have his information?

401
00:41:26,586 --> 00:41:29,748
It's in her profile.
Everything's on the computer.

402
00:41:32,926 --> 00:41:35,037
Smart girl.

403
00:41:35,137 --> 00:41:38,166
It's not over. She's got
a lot of fight in her yet.

404
00:41:38,266 --> 00:41:40,501
Open your eyes, Frank. It is over.

405
00:41:40,601 --> 00:41:43,004
This girl's gonna be the end
of the company and Gault.

406
00:41:43,104 --> 00:41:45,973
- It's time to split.
- We're not going anywhere.

407
00:41:47,442 --> 00:41:50,478
Very athletic. Impressive.

408
00:43:10,192 --> 00:43:11,560
No.

409
00:43:14,404 --> 00:43:16,648
No!

410
00:43:29,796 --> 00:43:32,407
That poor guy. He didn't
even see you coming.

411
00:43:32,507 --> 00:43:34,581
- Come on, he did it to himself.
- No.

412
00:43:34,682 --> 00:43:36,035
Seriously.

413
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:49,007
This is Ray. I'm not
available right now.

414
00:43:49,107 --> 00:43:52,051
Leave me a message and I'll get
back to you as soon as possible.

415
00:43:53,151 --> 00:43:55,681
Ray! Ray!

416
00:43:56,281 --> 00:43:57,724
Ray!

417
00:44:45,122 --> 00:44:47,066
Hey, be patient.

418
00:44:47,166 --> 00:44:49,360
She'll be here.

419
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:53,163
You know Jane. Her two
hours always turn into five.

420
00:44:54,298 --> 00:44:55,699
Take it easy, cowboy.

421
00:44:55,799 --> 00:44:57,243
Hey, you know she loves you.

422
00:44:57,343 --> 00:45:00,204
No, she loves her job.
I'm a close second, though.

423
00:45:00,304 --> 00:45:01,747
Cut her a break.

424
00:45:01,847 --> 00:45:03,841
It's just hard.

425
00:45:05,351 --> 00:45:07,678
She doesn't let anybody in.

426
00:45:09,605 --> 00:45:12,592
Let's give her one more hour.

427
00:45:12,692 --> 00:45:15,637
If she doesn't show,
we'll go and get her.

428
00:45:15,737 --> 00:45:18,923
- One more round, all right? On me.
- Perfect.

429
00:45:19,824 --> 00:45:22,819
Excuse me. Can we get
another round, please?

430
00:46:58,173 --> 00:47:02,003
No. No, no, no, no.

431
00:47:29,122 --> 00:47:31,366
You can't open it.

432
00:47:32,542 --> 00:47:35,028
You can't open it, you jerk!

433
00:47:35,128 --> 00:47:36,863
You little bitch.

434
00:48:30,476 --> 00:48:33,337
Okay, we need to start using
our brains here, okay?

435
00:48:33,437 --> 00:48:35,047
This thing has spiraled
out of control.

436
00:48:35,147 --> 00:48:37,349
You got to start listening to me.

437
00:48:38,401 --> 00:48:40,728
- Listening to you?
- Yeah.

438
00:48:41,529 --> 00:48:44,307
Look, I have access

439
00:48:44,407 --> 00:48:47,478
to several accounts that
this company holds offshore.

440
00:48:47,578 --> 00:48:51,273
Large accounts. Let's cut our losses

441
00:48:51,373 --> 00:48:53,492
and let someone else
handle this crap.

442
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:58,822
What's wrong?

443
00:48:58,922 --> 00:49:01,700
- You.
- Oh, great.

444
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,494
What's that supposed to mean?

445
00:49:03,594 --> 00:49:07,631
Your lack of loyalty disgusts me.

446
00:49:14,771 --> 00:49:17,216
Now wait. Hold it, damn it.

447
00:49:17,316 --> 00:49:20,052
- Call Gault.
- And tell him what?

448
00:49:20,152 --> 00:49:21,678
Okay, no, look, Frank.

449
00:49:21,778 --> 00:49:26,433
Frank, I'll pay you all my options.

450
00:49:26,533 --> 00:49:28,811
The offshore account.

451
00:49:28,911 --> 00:49:31,897
You offering me a bribe?

452
00:49:31,997 --> 00:49:35,526
I could pay you more
than Gault ever will ever.

453
00:49:35,626 --> 00:49:38,286
You know it and I know it.

454
00:49:42,467 --> 00:49:45,294
Look, hey, you can kill me...

455
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:51,008
or you can be $5 million richer.

456
00:49:52,143 --> 00:49:53,795
A wire transfer?

457
00:49:53,895 --> 00:49:56,681
Yes. Instant.

458
00:49:58,358 --> 00:50:00,385
I work in cash.

459
00:50:19,087 --> 00:50:20,613
Frank, please.

460
00:50:20,713 --> 00:50:23,867
You had one job...
to protect the company.

461
00:50:23,967 --> 00:50:25,543
I did.

462
00:50:27,011 --> 00:50:30,081
No, you didn't.

463
00:50:34,687 --> 00:50:36,547
Oh, God.

464
00:50:45,906 --> 00:50:48,734
Oh, God.

465
00:51:10,305 --> 00:51:11,749
How's that?

466
00:51:11,849 --> 00:51:13,792
How's that feel?

467
00:51:13,892 --> 00:51:16,053
No more.

468
00:51:17,354 --> 00:51:19,765
Where you going?

469
00:51:22,776 --> 00:51:25,304
Frank, I'm sorry.

470
00:51:25,404 --> 00:51:28,024
Frank, I'm sorry.

471
00:51:29,743 --> 00:51:33,980
No. No. No. No, no.

472
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:37,158
No. No.

473
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:42,413
No!

474
00:52:00,106 --> 00:52:01,383
No, Walt, listen,

475
00:52:01,483 --> 00:52:04,811
this is turning into a witch hunt.

476
00:52:06,112 --> 00:52:07,555
Yes.

477
00:52:07,655 --> 00:52:10,725
Listen, are you just
going to let the SEC

478
00:52:10,825 --> 00:52:14,862
continue to investigate these
Mickey Mouse allegations?

479
00:52:17,082 --> 00:52:18,608
No.

480
00:52:18,708 --> 00:52:20,694
All right, all right. I understand.

481
00:52:20,794 --> 00:52:22,530
I understand.

482
00:52:22,630 --> 00:52:26,367
Well, when are you gonna get
back to the private sector?

483
00:52:26,467 --> 00:52:31,205
You know there's always
a position for you here.

484
00:52:31,305 --> 00:52:33,416
Sure. Yeah.

485
00:52:33,516 --> 00:52:35,759
All right, good night.

486
00:52:50,157 --> 00:52:52,018
Janey.

487
00:52:52,118 --> 00:52:55,563
We have an interesting problem.

488
00:52:55,663 --> 00:52:57,523
You stuck in that elevator

489
00:52:57,623 --> 00:52:59,817
and me stuck in this building.

490
00:52:59,917 --> 00:53:03,871
Stasis until something gives.

491
00:53:06,006 --> 00:53:08,701
I don't want to talk
to you. Put Taft on.

492
00:53:08,801 --> 00:53:10,870
Mr. Taft is not available right now,

493
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:12,963
but I'd be happy to take a message.

494
00:53:15,684 --> 00:53:19,012
Okay, put Lamont on.

495
00:53:20,397 --> 00:53:22,849
Lamont's resting.

496
00:53:24,192 --> 00:53:28,063
You monster.

497
00:53:28,864 --> 00:53:31,232
You're about to find out.

498
00:53:34,077 --> 00:53:36,321
Go to hell.

499
00:54:12,825 --> 00:54:15,319
Where are you going now?

500
00:54:47,976 --> 00:54:51,155
No! Let go! Let go!

501
00:54:56,869 --> 00:54:59,230
No!

502
00:55:05,337 --> 00:55:06,989
Fuck!

503
00:56:28,963 --> 00:56:31,491
What's next?

504
00:56:31,591 --> 00:56:33,326
You gonna stare me to death?

505
00:56:33,426 --> 00:56:36,621
I'm trying to remember.

506
00:56:36,721 --> 00:56:39,048
It's a thing about a cat.

507
00:56:40,350 --> 00:56:44,295
Some guy's name. Schumer's cat.

508
00:56:44,395 --> 00:56:46,965
Schlesinger's.

509
00:56:47,065 --> 00:56:49,050
It's a paradox.

510
00:56:49,150 --> 00:56:52,304
The cat in the box

511
00:56:52,404 --> 00:56:55,391
that's both alive and dead.

512
00:56:55,491 --> 00:56:57,643
Just like you, Janey.

513
00:56:57,743 --> 00:57:00,020
You think you have me beat?

514
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:01,647
Look where you are.

515
00:57:01,747 --> 00:57:04,984
Savoring the moment.

516
00:57:05,084 --> 00:57:06,944
You're gonna look back and
remember this as the night

517
00:57:07,044 --> 00:57:09,655
that everything came crashing down.

518
00:57:09,755 --> 00:57:11,790
Maybe.

519
00:57:26,605 --> 00:57:29,558
You and Gault will
make great cellmates.

520
00:57:44,207 --> 00:57:46,818
- Daddy!
- Hey!

521
00:57:46,918 --> 00:57:49,245
- Oh. Sorry I'm late.
- Hi.

522
00:57:50,088 --> 00:57:53,658
I thought that I would never
get that elevator running.

523
00:57:53,758 --> 00:57:56,036
- Can I stay up late?
- No.

524
00:57:56,136 --> 00:57:58,455
We made a deal. 8:00.

525
00:57:58,555 --> 00:58:00,707
Tomorrow night you can stay up
as late as you want for your party.

526
00:58:00,807 --> 00:58:02,792
Will there be a pony
ride like at Hudson's?

527
00:58:02,892 --> 00:58:06,546
No. No smelly animals.
Absolutely not.

528
00:58:06,646 --> 00:58:09,799
- But Dad said...
- Okay, loudmouth.

529
00:58:09,899 --> 00:58:12,177
- Time for bed.
- Tell me you didn't.

530
00:58:12,277 --> 00:58:14,346
- He didn't.
- I didn't.

531
00:58:14,446 --> 00:58:17,140
But you know my dad.
He can't say no to the squirt.

532
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:18,725
And neither can you.

533
00:58:21,286 --> 00:58:22,729
Oh.

534
00:58:22,829 --> 00:58:25,065
All right, come on, monster.

535
00:58:25,165 --> 00:58:27,233
Good night, buddy.

536
00:58:27,333 --> 00:58:28,526
- Good night.
- Good night.

537
00:58:28,626 --> 00:58:30,778
- Let me know if I should wait up.
- Okay.

538
00:58:32,178 --> 00:58:33,356
This is Robert.

539
00:58:45,269 --> 00:58:48,464
- Gault Towers.
- Just returning to inform you

540
00:58:48,564 --> 00:58:51,592
that a service man has been contacted
and should be there shortly.

541
00:58:51,692 --> 00:58:55,713
Thank you very much. Good night.

542
00:59:02,536 --> 00:59:06,232
Tick-tock. Tick-tock.

543
00:59:06,332 --> 00:59:09,827
If you could do something,
you'd do it.

544
00:59:11,045 --> 00:59:12,738
Oh, I'm doing something.

545
00:59:12,838 --> 00:59:15,116
You're screwed.

546
00:59:15,216 --> 00:59:18,202
But you can't leave 'cause
you're just Gault's janitor.

547
00:59:18,302 --> 00:59:19,878
That's all you are.

548
00:59:21,764 --> 00:59:24,049
I'm a whole lot more than that.

549
00:59:24,892 --> 00:59:27,461
Like your friend Mike found out.

550
00:59:27,561 --> 00:59:31,182
He couldn't see the bigger picture.

551
00:59:33,026 --> 00:59:35,053
Just like you, Janey.

552
00:59:35,153 --> 00:59:38,773
You could have been sitting pretty
right now if you'd played ball.

553
00:59:39,783 --> 00:59:42,561
Now you're just another loose end.

554
00:59:42,661 --> 00:59:45,488
It's a sacrifice for
the greater good.

555
00:59:50,585 --> 00:59:52,195
What do you think of that?

556
00:59:52,295 --> 00:59:53,955
I never thought of anybody else.

557
00:59:55,757 --> 00:59:57,993
Janey.

558
00:59:58,093 --> 01:00:00,754
But I have your word?

559
01:00:01,846 --> 01:00:03,548
That's right.

560
01:00:06,685 --> 01:00:09,471
Do this one thing and
your family is set for life.

561
01:00:11,565 --> 01:00:13,516
I can't.

562
01:00:14,442 --> 01:00:16,478
I can't do it.

563
01:00:22,284 --> 01:00:23,985
Let me help you.

564
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:51,631
Come on, then.

565
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:53,883
Do something.

566
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:57,645
I'm waiting for you.

567
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:01,565
You hear me?

568
01:01:02,658 --> 01:01:04,652
Do something!

569
01:01:05,661 --> 01:01:07,863
Come on!

570
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:10,866
Do something!

571
01:01:16,797 --> 01:01:19,334
I'm talking to you!

572
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:43,100
Hey, thanks for coming out so late.

573
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,352
Oh, it's not a problem.

574
01:01:45,452 --> 01:01:47,521
It's part of the job, right?

575
01:01:47,621 --> 01:01:49,856
Someone stuck?

576
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:52,401
Yeah, I got a lady
trapped in elevator two.

577
01:01:52,501 --> 01:01:54,278
She's freaking out.
Can you believe that?

578
01:01:54,378 --> 01:01:56,663
What happened to Lamont?

579
01:01:58,090 --> 01:02:00,826
You're wearing his shirt.
Jeez, he didn't get fired, did he?

580
01:02:00,926 --> 01:02:02,744
Oh, no, no, no. He went home sick.

581
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:05,581
And I'm the new guy and
I didn't have any shirts.

582
01:02:05,681 --> 01:02:08,375
They didn't have 'em made up for
me so let me... he's a nice guy.

583
01:02:08,475 --> 01:02:10,586
- Frank.
- Robert.

584
01:02:10,686 --> 01:02:13,764
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.

585
01:02:14,565 --> 01:02:17,427
All right, I'll check
the machine room.

586
01:02:17,527 --> 01:02:21,431
Should probably be able to
get it started from there.

587
01:02:21,531 --> 01:02:23,308
You know what? Lamont left sick

588
01:02:23,408 --> 01:02:26,811
and he left in such a hurry
he never gave me those keys.

589
01:02:26,911 --> 01:02:29,022
How am I supposed
to reboot the system?

590
01:02:29,122 --> 01:02:30,732
Can't you just get on
top of the elevator,

591
01:02:30,832 --> 01:02:32,442
take her out through
the emergency hatch?

592
01:02:32,542 --> 01:02:34,193
It's against regulations.

593
01:02:34,293 --> 01:02:36,863
Extracting passengers through
the hatch is strictly last resort.

594
01:02:36,963 --> 01:02:38,781
My job's kind of on the line here.

595
01:02:38,881 --> 01:02:41,659
- Your job?
- Yeah, it's my first day.

596
01:02:41,759 --> 01:02:44,787
I got this hotshot exec yelling
about how she's gonna get me fired

597
01:02:44,887 --> 01:02:46,547
because I can't get her out.

598
01:02:49,809 --> 01:02:52,337
I've been on unemployment for a year.

599
01:02:52,437 --> 01:02:55,298
I got a wife and kids.
I need this job. Please.

600
01:02:55,398 --> 01:02:57,175
One time.

601
01:02:57,275 --> 01:02:58,760
Please.

602
01:02:58,860 --> 01:03:00,678
Okay.

603
01:03:15,544 --> 01:03:17,363
You owe me one, Frank.

604
01:03:22,468 --> 01:03:26,372
If anyone asks, I tried to fix the
problem downstairs first, okay?

605
01:03:26,472 --> 01:03:28,966
Absolutely. 100%.

606
01:03:40,527 --> 01:03:41,845
Something wrong?

607
01:03:41,945 --> 01:03:44,640
Oh, no, it's just my
wife saying good night.

608
01:03:44,740 --> 01:03:47,101
Well, the sooner we get done here,

609
01:03:47,201 --> 01:03:48,902
the sooner you get
home to her, right?

610
01:03:49,703 --> 01:03:52,155
Yup. Amen to that.

611
01:03:54,166 --> 01:03:56,201
All right.

612
01:04:13,393 --> 01:04:14,804
All right, here we go.

613
01:04:30,078 --> 01:04:31,688
Did you open the
doors already, Frank?

614
01:04:31,788 --> 01:04:34,274
I did. I was just
trying to get her out.

615
01:04:34,374 --> 01:04:37,652
I guess you need some kind of special
tool for that bolt or something.

616
01:04:37,752 --> 01:04:39,946
Yeah, there's a very
good reason for that.

617
01:04:40,046 --> 01:04:41,948
It's so that untrained
people like yourself

618
01:04:42,048 --> 01:04:43,950
don't get yourself killed.

619
01:04:44,050 --> 01:04:46,578
Elevators are the safest
form of transportation

620
01:04:46,678 --> 01:04:47,996
and that's an actual fact.

621
01:04:48,096 --> 01:04:51,291
But that doesn't mean they won't
squish you real good if you get unlucky.

622
01:04:51,391 --> 01:04:54,462
Believe me, too many people do.
I have seen some things.

623
01:04:54,562 --> 01:04:57,298
Anyway, in the future when you
have a problem with an elevator,

624
01:04:57,398 --> 01:04:59,633
call a professional.
You might live longer, you know?

625
01:04:59,733 --> 01:05:02,720
That's good advice, thanks.

626
01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:04,764
- Hello.
- Help!

627
01:05:04,864 --> 01:05:06,474
Hey, you know what?
Don't get her stirred up again.

628
01:05:06,574 --> 01:05:09,351
I finally got her calmed down.
She as kind of flipping out.

629
01:05:09,451 --> 01:05:11,479
You know, she got it in her
head I was trying to hurt her.

630
01:05:11,579 --> 01:05:14,148
- Can you believe that?
- I've seen it before. No problem.

631
01:05:14,248 --> 01:05:15,900
People, when they get
into closed spaces,

632
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,535
sometimes they get a little crazy.
I'll just get her out.

633
01:05:23,215 --> 01:05:24,492
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

634
01:05:24,592 --> 01:05:26,452
- What are you doing?
- I'm just gonna help you.

635
01:05:26,552 --> 01:05:29,997
Yeah, don't.
This is what I do, Frank.

636
01:05:30,097 --> 01:05:31,832
When you get a license
to fix elevators,

637
01:05:31,932 --> 01:05:33,626
you can play around in
the shaft all you like.

638
01:05:33,726 --> 01:05:36,261
But until then, just,
you know, give me a break.

639
01:05:38,606 --> 01:05:41,675
Help! Please, get me out of here!

640
01:05:41,775 --> 01:05:43,636
Please, you've got to
get me out of here fast.

641
01:05:43,736 --> 01:05:45,813
- I'm going to go crazy.
- She's totally lost it.

642
01:05:47,449 --> 01:05:50,143
Just take it easy, lady.
It's okay.

643
01:05:50,243 --> 01:05:51,937
We'll have you out in
just a second, all right?

644
01:05:52,037 --> 01:05:54,189
No, get me out of here now, please!

645
01:05:54,289 --> 01:05:56,358
I'm gonna go crazy in here.
Please, please.

646
01:05:56,458 --> 01:05:59,110
Get me out of here. This guy shot me.

647
01:05:59,210 --> 01:06:01,112
Shot you, ma'am?

648
01:06:01,212 --> 01:06:04,866
Yes, he shot me.
I have the gun in here.

649
01:06:04,966 --> 01:06:08,870
Okay, just relax, ma'am.
Nobody's trying to kill you.

650
01:06:08,970 --> 01:06:12,374
I promise I'm gonna have you
out of there in just a second.

651
01:06:12,474 --> 01:06:14,884
If you just...

652
01:06:17,646 --> 01:06:19,089
Something wrong?

653
01:06:19,189 --> 01:06:20,924
Robert?

654
01:06:21,024 --> 01:06:23,218
Yeah.

655
01:06:23,318 --> 01:06:25,929
Looks like there's...
there's, like, a bunch of...

656
01:06:26,029 --> 01:06:28,606
dirt or something caked in here.

657
01:06:29,824 --> 01:06:31,893
Get me out now!

658
01:06:31,993 --> 01:06:34,145
Oh, yeah.

659
01:06:34,245 --> 01:06:35,605
I'll have you out in a second.

660
01:06:35,705 --> 01:06:39,576
Actually, I'm gonna have to grab
a screwdriver or something.

661
01:06:40,502 --> 01:06:41,787
No.

662
01:06:43,589 --> 01:06:45,283
No.

663
01:06:45,383 --> 01:06:46,784
No! No!

664
01:06:46,884 --> 01:06:49,336
- You're a terrible liar.
- Huh?

665
01:07:04,151 --> 01:07:05,970
No! No!

666
01:07:06,070 --> 01:07:07,597
No!

667
01:07:12,843 --> 01:07:15,154
No! No!

668
01:07:33,639 --> 01:07:35,842
No. No. No.

669
01:07:59,541 --> 01:08:03,153
Whoa, no! No, no, no!
Stop! Stop! Stop!

670
01:08:03,253 --> 01:08:05,906
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

671
01:08:06,006 --> 01:08:08,408
Calm down. Calm down. Look.
Look. Look. Look. Look.

672
01:08:08,508 --> 01:08:10,911
Look, I'm just a repair man.
Calm down.

673
01:08:11,011 --> 01:08:13,580
Calm down. Stop. Calm down.

674
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:16,333
- I'm not gonna hurt you.
- Oh, my God.

675
01:08:16,433 --> 01:08:18,126
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

676
01:08:18,226 --> 01:08:19,844
Yeah.

677
01:08:21,271 --> 01:08:23,507
I'm assuming since
I'm still breathing

678
01:08:23,607 --> 01:08:26,468
- that that gun is not loaded.
- No.

679
01:08:26,568 --> 01:08:28,179
Is he still out there?

680
01:08:28,279 --> 01:08:30,348
Yeah. What the hell is going on?

681
01:08:30,448 --> 01:08:33,017
He's still out there. Did I call you?

682
01:08:33,117 --> 01:08:34,477
No, no, no.

683
01:08:34,577 --> 01:08:37,271
He just did what everybody does when
someone is stuck in an elevator.

684
01:08:37,371 --> 01:08:40,316
They call a repairman.

685
01:08:45,254 --> 01:08:48,165
Oh, wait. Wait, you are shot.

686
01:08:48,966 --> 01:08:50,076
Yeah, but I'm okay.

687
01:08:50,176 --> 01:08:51,911
Listen, we need to get out of
here before he comes back.

688
01:08:52,011 --> 01:08:54,372
Listen to me.
Where does that ladder go?

689
01:08:54,472 --> 01:08:56,499
It goes to the roof, but just relax.

690
01:08:56,599 --> 01:08:59,544
I closed the outer doors.
He can't even get into the shaft.

691
01:08:59,644 --> 01:09:00,837
He did before.

692
01:09:00,937 --> 01:09:03,214
Yeah, but before he had this.

693
01:09:03,314 --> 01:09:05,299
It's the building's elevator key.

694
01:09:05,399 --> 01:09:08,219
He can't get into the
elevators without it.

695
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:10,888
This is the safest place.

696
01:09:10,988 --> 01:09:14,225
In an hour, when my wife starts
to wonder what's happened,

697
01:09:14,325 --> 01:09:15,560
she'll call someone.

698
01:09:15,660 --> 01:09:17,228
Can't he just get another key?

699
01:09:17,328 --> 01:09:19,564
There is no other key.
Not in this building anyway.

700
01:09:19,664 --> 01:09:23,152
How can you be sure of that?

701
01:09:23,252 --> 01:09:25,287
Take a look.

702
01:09:28,715 --> 01:09:31,410
What, Robert Brown?
You're Robert Brown?

703
01:09:31,510 --> 01:09:35,039
Well, Robert Brown, Jr.
I work for my dad.

704
01:09:37,224 --> 01:09:39,251
You are?

705
01:09:39,351 --> 01:09:42,963
Jane. Jane Porter.

706
01:09:43,063 --> 01:09:47,176
Well, it's nothing personal,
Jane Porter,

707
01:09:47,276 --> 01:09:50,020
but it has not been my
pleasure to meet you.

708
01:10:02,166 --> 01:10:04,610
So he's not getting in here?

709
01:10:04,710 --> 01:10:06,779
No.

710
01:10:06,879 --> 01:10:09,206
You promise?

711
01:10:10,007 --> 01:10:11,917
I promise.

712
01:10:14,094 --> 01:10:16,005
Okay.

713
01:10:18,057 --> 01:10:20,176
You pack a mean wallop, by the way.

714
01:10:21,394 --> 01:10:23,429
Sorry.

715
01:10:27,483 --> 01:10:29,803
Couldn't he just get a key
from another building?

716
01:10:29,903 --> 01:10:33,014
Not all buildings
have the same elevator key.

717
01:10:33,114 --> 01:10:35,809
What's he gonna do,
break into every one on the block

718
01:10:35,909 --> 01:10:37,852
and risk more witnesses?

719
01:10:37,952 --> 01:10:39,529
I don't think so.

720
01:10:41,497 --> 01:10:43,950
Drink up.

721
01:10:50,882 --> 01:10:53,118
She'll be here.

722
01:10:53,218 --> 01:10:55,245
It's getting pretty late.

723
01:10:55,345 --> 01:10:57,004
I better go get her.

724
01:11:24,625 --> 01:11:27,862
Oh, hey, Jane. I will
bet you a million bucks

725
01:11:27,962 --> 01:11:30,164
that we are both gonna be fine.

726
01:11:31,507 --> 01:11:33,033
A million?

727
01:11:35,177 --> 01:11:37,496
Elevator repair business
must be booming.

728
01:11:37,596 --> 01:11:39,081
It's pretty good.

729
01:11:39,181 --> 01:11:41,333
It's honest work and it's steady.

730
01:11:41,433 --> 01:11:43,419
My wife and I have a beautiful house.

731
01:11:43,519 --> 01:11:46,088
We put a little money aside
for our kid to go to college.

732
01:11:46,188 --> 01:11:48,307
What more does a man want, right?

733
01:11:49,984 --> 01:11:53,554
You're right. You really are.

734
01:11:53,654 --> 01:11:56,724
Yeah, I see people just
chasing more, you know?

735
01:11:56,824 --> 01:11:59,643
More stuff, more money, more power.

736
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:02,396
Never satisfied.

737
01:12:02,496 --> 01:12:06,034
Those people are more stuck
than we are right now.

738
01:12:08,128 --> 01:12:12,574
Thank you, Mr. Robert Brown, Jr.

739
01:12:12,674 --> 01:12:14,792
What for?

740
01:12:16,011 --> 01:12:18,496
For rescuing me, of course.

741
01:12:18,596 --> 01:12:20,957
Well, we're not out of this box yet,

742
01:12:21,057 --> 01:12:24,002
but, yeah, we're gonna be fine.

743
01:12:24,102 --> 01:12:27,380
In fact, I will bet that guy is
probably a million miles away by now.

744
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:28,673
Just doing whatever...

745
01:12:28,773 --> 01:12:32,594
3-4-1 -8-2...

746
01:12:32,694 --> 01:12:34,554
What? What did he say?

747
01:12:34,654 --> 01:12:36,681
...Ramble Hills Drive.

748
01:12:36,781 --> 01:12:42,062
3-4-1 -8-2

749
01:12:42,162 --> 01:12:45,106
Ramble Hills Drive.

750
01:12:45,206 --> 01:12:47,901
You hear me, repairman?

751
01:12:48,001 --> 01:12:50,578
Robert? Robert, what's wrong?

752
01:12:51,629 --> 01:12:53,865
You say you fix elevators.

753
01:12:53,965 --> 01:12:56,534
Well, I'm in a different
line of work.

754
01:12:56,634 --> 01:12:58,371
You hear me, repairman?

755
01:12:58,471 --> 01:13:00,790
You hurt my family, I will kill you!

756
01:13:00,890 --> 01:13:04,627
Do you understand? I will kill you!

757
01:13:04,727 --> 01:13:07,630
You have 60 seconds to open this door

758
01:13:07,730 --> 01:13:11,759
or I'm gonna go down
to Ramble Hills Drive

759
01:13:11,859 --> 01:13:15,012
and introduce myself to your family.

760
01:13:15,112 --> 01:13:18,140
They'll get to see up
close what it is I do.

761
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:20,526
Oh, God.

762
01:13:23,079 --> 01:13:25,147
Your wife's kind of hot.

763
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:27,783
I may have a look.

764
01:13:30,252 --> 01:13:33,038
60 seconds and counting, Robert.

765
01:13:36,967 --> 01:13:39,912
45 seconds, repairman.

766
01:13:40,012 --> 01:13:43,382
You care about a stranger
more than your family?

767
01:13:51,441 --> 01:13:53,093
30.

768
01:13:53,193 --> 01:13:55,637
I'm sorry, I've got to do it.

769
01:13:55,737 --> 01:13:57,389
I got a kid.

770
01:13:57,489 --> 01:13:59,057
No, wait! Wait!

771
01:13:59,157 --> 01:14:02,144
- Let me go. Let me go.
- No.

772
01:14:02,244 --> 01:14:04,187
This is my thing. He wants me.

773
01:14:04,287 --> 01:14:06,690
I'm not leaving the lives of my
family to you or anybody else.

774
01:14:06,790 --> 01:14:09,276
Now help me up.

775
01:14:09,376 --> 01:14:12,112
Okay. Okay. Okay, okay, okay, Okay.

776
01:14:12,212 --> 01:14:14,406
- Help me.
- Come on. Come on.

777
01:14:14,506 --> 01:14:16,366
Okay.

778
01:14:16,466 --> 01:14:18,869
Okay, you got this.

779
01:14:18,969 --> 01:14:21,538
15 seconds.

780
01:14:21,638 --> 01:14:23,206
You don't know where to go.

781
01:14:23,306 --> 01:14:24,875
I need to borrow your key card.

782
01:14:24,975 --> 01:14:27,294
Shoot.

783
01:14:27,394 --> 01:14:29,254
I don't...

784
01:14:29,354 --> 01:14:31,423
- All right, hold on.
- You're quick on your feet.

785
01:14:31,523 --> 01:14:34,092
- Stay right here.
- Jane always said that.

786
01:14:34,192 --> 01:14:37,062
I got it. Come on.

787
01:15:16,235 --> 01:15:18,187
You've been a lot of trouble.

788
01:15:18,988 --> 01:15:21,232
But not anymore.

789
01:16:00,322 --> 01:16:02,057
Get off!

790
01:16:06,245 --> 01:16:10,149
I'm gonna keep doing it until all
the tendons in your wrist snap.

791
01:16:10,249 --> 01:16:12,860
The copy, did you make one?

792
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:14,903
No. No.

793
01:16:15,603 --> 01:16:17,256
Make me believe you.

794
01:16:18,056 --> 01:16:22,043
Okay, okay! Okay, just stop, please.

795
01:17:24,115 --> 01:17:26,735
How's that feel?

796
01:18:25,512 --> 01:18:27,956
No, get off!

797
01:18:30,308 --> 01:18:31,876
- Get off!
- Jane, what's going on?

798
01:18:31,976 --> 01:18:33,887
Are you okay?

799
01:18:51,037 --> 01:18:52,897
Are you okay?

800
01:18:52,997 --> 01:18:56,484
Yes. Take the elevator
down to the garage.

801
01:18:56,584 --> 01:18:58,153
What? Why?

802
01:18:58,253 --> 01:18:59,904
Ray!

803
01:19:00,004 --> 01:19:03,283
It's been a long night.
I just want to go home.

804
01:19:03,383 --> 01:19:06,002
Going down.

805
01:19:15,646 --> 01:19:17,556
No.

806
01:20:03,903 --> 01:20:06,146
Jane!

807
01:20:08,617 --> 01:20:10,435
Oh, my God! Baby!

808
01:20:10,535 --> 01:20:12,729
Baby, are you okay?

809
01:20:12,829 --> 01:20:14,731
- Yeah.
- What's happening?

810
01:20:14,831 --> 01:20:17,067
- What...
- Don't worry, I'm okay.

811
01:20:17,167 --> 01:20:19,194
My God, what happened to you?

812
01:20:19,294 --> 01:20:21,196
What...

813
01:20:21,296 --> 01:20:23,240
what happened to you, baby?

814
01:20:23,340 --> 01:20:24,741
Oh, my God.

815
01:20:24,841 --> 01:20:27,160
I'll tell you everything.
Could we go home, please?

816
01:20:27,260 --> 01:20:29,204
Yes. Yeah.

817
01:20:29,304 --> 01:20:31,081
Okay.

818
01:20:31,181 --> 01:20:32,916
Oh, baby.

819
01:20:33,016 --> 01:20:35,010
I love you.

820
01:20:43,610 --> 01:20:45,178
Your vitals all look really good.

821
01:20:45,278 --> 01:20:46,805
- That's good.
- Comfortable?

822
01:20:46,905 --> 01:20:49,766
All things considered, yeah.

823
01:20:49,866 --> 01:20:52,102
When do you thinks the earliest
I'll be able to get out of here?

824
01:20:52,202 --> 01:20:53,937
I'm gonna keep you overnight

825
01:20:54,037 --> 01:20:57,315
and if you're feeling well,
probably get you to work on Monday.

826
01:20:57,415 --> 01:20:59,776
- Babe.
- Hi.

827
01:20:59,876 --> 01:21:02,989
- I'm so glad you're okay.
- Hey. Thanks. I'm good.

828
01:21:03,089 --> 01:21:05,499
I'm okay. I love you.

829
01:21:06,467 --> 01:21:08,286
- Hey.
- What happened?

830
01:21:08,386 --> 01:21:10,121
What's up, man? How you doing?

831
01:21:10,221 --> 01:21:11,581
- Good.
- Happy birthday.

832
01:21:11,681 --> 01:21:13,291
Thank you.

833
01:21:13,391 --> 01:21:15,126
Jane, oh.

834
01:21:15,226 --> 01:21:18,254
There was a woman on the
elevator with me named Jane.

835
01:21:18,354 --> 01:21:20,089
Yeah, she called and checked on you.

836
01:21:20,189 --> 01:21:22,683
- She okay?
- She's gonna be fine.

837
01:21:24,652 --> 01:21:26,095
I'll be back to check
on you in a little bit.

838
01:21:26,195 --> 01:21:28,355
Hi.

839
01:21:49,510 --> 01:21:51,462
Jane.

840
01:21:53,764 --> 01:21:55,334
Hi.

841
01:21:55,434 --> 01:21:57,920
Well, Jane, you look
surprised to see me.

842
01:21:58,020 --> 01:21:59,838
Pleasantly so, I hope.

843
01:21:59,938 --> 01:22:02,841
No, I knew I'd see you again.

844
01:22:02,941 --> 01:22:04,968
I just thought you'd be in handcuffs.

845
01:22:05,068 --> 01:22:07,346
Well, Jane, you know
how these things work.

846
01:22:07,446 --> 01:22:10,974
By the way, I've ordered a complete
and thorough investigation

847
01:22:11,074 --> 01:22:14,269
into this whole sorry affair.

848
01:22:14,369 --> 01:22:16,355
Don't insult me, Mr. Gault.

849
01:22:16,455 --> 01:22:18,357
I know what you've done

850
01:22:18,457 --> 01:22:20,192
and I'm not gonna let
you get away with it.

851
01:22:20,292 --> 01:22:24,363
Jane, please don't be foolish.

852
01:22:24,463 --> 01:22:27,866
Pick your bets very carefully.

853
01:22:27,966 --> 01:22:30,828
You know, a wise man once said,

854
01:22:30,928 --> 01:22:34,331
"He who controls the
nation's money supply

855
01:22:34,431 --> 01:22:37,835
cares not who makes its laws."

856
01:22:37,935 --> 01:22:39,545
You're going to jail.

857
01:22:39,645 --> 01:22:41,129
And if I don't?

858
01:22:41,229 --> 01:22:44,049
Do you think I'm going
to forget about you?

859
01:22:44,149 --> 01:22:48,054
I don't think you or I can afford
to forget about one another.

860
01:22:48,154 --> 01:22:50,932
Such a shame.

861
01:22:51,032 --> 01:22:54,185
You know, power would
have sat so beautifully

862
01:22:54,285 --> 01:22:56,771
on those elegant shoulders of yours.

863
01:22:56,871 --> 01:23:01,568
You would have been a strong,
extraordinary leader in business.

864
01:23:01,668 --> 01:23:05,955
But as it is, you've got
no sense of humor.

865
01:23:07,006 --> 01:23:11,043
Did you ever consider that
maybe you're not funny, sir?

866
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:14,998
Oh...

867
01:23:15,098 --> 01:23:17,466
say hi to Walt for me.

868
01:23:37,704 --> 01:23:40,565
Are you sure you're ready
to leave this all behind?

869
01:23:40,665 --> 01:23:43,777
Everything I need is right here.

870
01:23:51,427 --> 01:23:52,870
Thaddeus Gault appeared before

871
01:23:52,970 --> 01:23:54,955
the Securities and
Exchange Commission today

872
01:23:55,055 --> 01:23:57,666
to answer charges of
fraud and embezzlement.

873
01:23:57,766 --> 01:24:00,252
If found guilty as CEO
of Gault Capital,

874
01:24:00,352 --> 01:24:03,547
he could be facing up
to 20 years in prison.

875
01:24:03,647 --> 01:24:05,966
There is also an
ongoing investigation

876
01:24:06,066 --> 01:24:08,135
into the suspicious
and untimely death

877
01:24:08,235 --> 01:24:10,346
of one of Gault Capital's
financial advisors.
