Beauty and the Beast

3
00:01:30,836 --> 00:01:33,657
written and directed by
Jean Cocteau

4
00:01:33,762 --> 00:01:38,475
from a story by
Madame Leprince de Beaumont

5
00:02:35,252 --> 00:02:38,441
- Action.
- Rolling.

6
00:02:38,547 --> 00:02:40,819
Beauty and the beast,
take one.

7
00:02:40,924 --> 00:02:42,843
Cut. Just a minute.

8
00:02:44,339 --> 00:02:49,787
Children believe what we tell them.
They have complete faith in us.

9
00:02:49,894 --> 00:02:53,792
They believe that a rose plucked
from a garden

10
00:02:53,899 --> 00:02:59,508
can plunge a family into conflict.

11
00:02:59,615 --> 00:03:03,347
They believe that the hands
of a human beast

12
00:03:03,453 --> 00:03:09,375
will smoke when he slays a victim,

13
00:03:09,084 --> 00:03:12,566
and that this will cause
the beast shame

14
00:03:12,671 --> 00:03:17,455
when a young maiden
takes up residence in his home.

15
00:03:17,093 --> 00:03:20,868
They believe a thousand other
simple things.

16
00:03:21,298 --> 00:03:25,247
I ask of you a little
of this childlike simplicity,

17
00:03:25,354 --> 00:03:30,128
and, to bring us luck,

18
00:03:30,234 --> 00:03:35,550
let me speak four truly magic words,
childhood's 'open sesame':

19
00:03:35,657 --> 00:03:41,205
"Once upon a time..."

20
00:03:45,294 --> 00:03:46,712
that girl!

21
00:03:46,755 --> 00:03:49,799
You know how she is.
She can't do a thing.

22
00:03:53,263 --> 00:03:54,848
No good!

23
00:03:56,558 --> 00:04:00,562
Cheater!
Your foot's not on the line.

24
00:04:02,648 --> 00:04:04,526
My dress!

25
00:04:05,485 --> 00:04:09,698
- What's the matter?
- They shot an arrow into the room.

26
00:04:14,245 --> 00:04:17,832
You brutes!
You could have blinded us!

27
00:04:22,714 --> 00:04:25,570
- Is Belle all right?
- Always Belle.

28
00:04:25,676 --> 00:04:27,094
The hell with her!

29
00:04:28,473 --> 00:04:32,100
You nearly killed cabriole.

30
00:04:50,706 --> 00:04:52,333
There they are.

31
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:59,925
Belle, scrub the floor.
We're going to be late for the duchess.

32
00:05:02,595 --> 00:05:05,118
Murderers!
- My sisters are shrews.

33
00:05:05,225 --> 00:05:08,538
Drinking, chasing girls and cheating
at cards - it's all they care about.

34
00:05:08,644 --> 00:05:12,459
When you're poor, you stay home
and wash clothes and polish the cutlery.

35
00:05:12,565 --> 00:05:14,546
These witches act like princesses

36
00:05:14,652 --> 00:05:17,549
and never even realize
everyone's laughing in their face.

37
00:05:17,656 --> 00:05:21,618
- Answer him.
- I won't give him the satisfaction.

38
00:05:23,287 --> 00:05:26,561
What beautiful creatures!

39
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:29,148
Let's hurry
or we'll miss the concert.

40
00:05:29,254 --> 00:05:31,733
So enchanting! So divine!

41
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,132
Simpletons!

42
00:05:33,174 --> 00:05:35,553
Footmen!

43
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,448
Incredible!

44
00:05:56,368 --> 00:05:59,663
Do we pay you to sleep?

45
00:06:02,251 --> 00:06:05,463
I've never seen anything like it!

46
00:06:08,633 --> 00:06:10,344
These chairs!

47
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:14,619
These chairs are filthy!

48
00:06:14,724 --> 00:06:16,602
Footmen!

49
00:06:19,521 --> 00:06:21,231
Hurry up!

50
00:06:22,484 --> 00:06:24,714
Come on, we're leaving!

51
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,907
Not under the ladder!

52
00:06:34,539 --> 00:06:38,627
Drunkards,
you're asleep on your feet!

53
00:07:08,205 --> 00:07:10,728
That drunkard doesn't
even know his place.

54
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:13,086
Good-for-nothing!

55
00:07:18,134 --> 00:07:21,555
They've been drinking!

56
00:07:22,431 --> 00:07:24,933
Come on, footmen!

57
00:07:33,444 --> 00:07:39,327
May the devil himself
splatter you with dung.

58
00:07:49,213 --> 00:07:51,216
Belle,

59
00:07:51,382 --> 00:07:54,844
you weren't made to be a servant.

60
00:07:55,387 --> 00:08:00,226
Even the floor longs
to be your mirror!

61
00:08:02,687 --> 00:08:06,461
You mustn't go on slaving
day and night for your sisters.

62
00:08:06,567 --> 00:08:09,716
If our father's ships
hadn't been lost in the storm,

63
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,301
then perhaps I could
enjoy myself like them.

64
00:08:12,407 --> 00:08:14,472
But we're ruined, Avenant,
and I must work.

65
00:08:14,576 --> 00:08:17,807
Why don't your sisters work?

66
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:19,811
My sisters are too beautiful.

67
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:22,753
Their hands are too white.

68
00:08:23,297 --> 00:08:24,714
Belle,

69
00:08:24,797 --> 00:08:27,634
you are the most beautiful of all!

70
00:08:28,428 --> 00:08:30,346
Look at your hands.

71
00:08:30,387 --> 00:08:32,159
Avenant, let go of my hand.

72
00:08:32,265 --> 00:08:35,664
Please go.
I must finish my work.

73
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:37,729
I love you.

74
00:08:39,733 --> 00:08:41,568
Marry me.

75
00:08:42,277 --> 00:08:44,591
No, Avenant.
You mustn't speak of that again.

76
00:08:44,697 --> 00:08:46,491
It's no use.

77
00:08:48,618 --> 00:08:50,537
You don't like me.

78
00:08:50,621 --> 00:08:52,601
It's not that, Avenant.

79
00:08:52,706 --> 00:08:54,208
Well, then?

80
00:08:54,251 --> 00:08:58,171
I must remain a maid
and stay with father.

81
00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:01,778
I'll carry you away
from this stupid life!

82
00:09:01,884 --> 00:09:03,470
Let me go!

83
00:09:03,554 --> 00:09:05,700
Get your hands off her!
You want a black eye?

84
00:09:05,807 --> 00:09:08,246
It's all right, Ludovic.
He was asking me to marry him.

85
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:11,688
- What did you say?
- Your sister doesn't want me.

86
00:09:12,523 --> 00:09:14,461
I'm a scoundrel, and proud of it,

87
00:09:14,567 --> 00:09:18,319
but I won't stand
to see you marry one.

88
00:09:20,574 --> 00:09:22,512
Consider yourself warned.

89
00:09:22,618 --> 00:09:25,621
Now clear out, you hoodlum!

90
00:09:29,918 --> 00:09:31,920
Avenant, you're mad!

91
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:36,842
Come in, gentlemen.

92
00:09:36,884 --> 00:09:41,472
Make yourselves at home
while I tell everyone the great news.

93
00:09:49,318 --> 00:09:51,236
My father!

94
00:09:53,154 --> 00:09:54,907
He mustn't know.

95
00:09:56,451 --> 00:09:59,599
My daughters are out
being pampered by high society.

96
00:09:59,703 --> 00:10:04,000
But I can't wait for them.
I'm itching to break the news.

97
00:10:07,505 --> 00:10:09,841
Come here, Belle.

98
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,426
Come, Ludovic.

99
00:10:12,677 --> 00:10:15,806
You're welcome too, Avenant.

100
00:10:20,395 --> 00:10:22,625
These gentlemen will overlook
your mischief,

101
00:10:22,732 --> 00:10:25,254
just as the prosecutor here
has done me the great favor

102
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,674
of suspending all proceedings
begun against me.

103
00:10:28,781 --> 00:10:30,427
We're going to be rich!

104
00:10:30,531 --> 00:10:32,471
One of my ships has arrived
with its cargo.

105
00:10:32,576 --> 00:10:34,680
- Avenant knew it!
- Ludovic!

106
00:10:34,788 --> 00:10:37,311
That's why he asked
Belle to marry him.

107
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:39,897
He asked me before
while we were still poor.

108
00:10:40,003 --> 00:10:44,424
- Are you going to leave me?
- No, father, I'll never leave you.

109
00:10:45,426 --> 00:10:47,407
They said the duchess
wasn't receiving guests,

110
00:10:47,511 --> 00:10:49,700
but we could hear laughter
and music in the court.

111
00:10:49,807 --> 00:10:52,579
Congratulations, father! We've just
reaped the fruits of your foolishness.

112
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:54,310
You should be proud!

113
00:10:54,395 --> 00:10:56,708
Invite one and all to drink
while your daughters are insulted

114
00:10:56,815 --> 00:10:58,585
and doors slam in their face!

115
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:01,381
- My darlings!
- That duchess is a smart woman.

116
00:11:01,487 --> 00:11:03,509
I'm so ashamed I could die!

117
00:11:03,614 --> 00:11:07,618
Come, Adelaide.
Leave them to drink to our ill fortune.

118
00:11:10,539 --> 00:11:11,914
Father!

119
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:15,857
Let those two devils sulk.
I'll soon make it up to them.

120
00:11:15,962 --> 00:11:18,734
I'll set out for port tomorrow
and settle my affairs.

121
00:11:18,842 --> 00:11:21,281
They'll be married
to a duke and a prince!

122
00:11:21,386 --> 00:11:22,595
Gentlemen!

123
00:11:28,645 --> 00:11:30,459
Bring us back
some brocade dresses.

124
00:11:30,563 --> 00:11:32,961
Jewels, fans
and ostrich feathers!

125
00:11:33,319 --> 00:11:36,007
I want the whole town
to die of envy!

126
00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:40,011
A monkey!
I'd like a monkey.

127
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:42,036
A parrot.

128
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:54,278
What shall I bring back
for you, Belle?

129
00:11:54,383 --> 00:11:57,865
Father, bring me a rose.

130
00:11:57,971 --> 00:12:01,391
There aren't any around here.

131
00:12:24,295 --> 00:12:27,610
If I don't pay up tonight,
they'll throw me in prison.

132
00:12:27,715 --> 00:12:31,489
A moneylender is quick to understand.
I told him the whole story.

133
00:12:31,595 --> 00:12:34,681
Lay it on thick.
Here he comes.

134
00:12:38,151 --> 00:12:41,000
It's a very large sum.

135
00:12:41,602 --> 00:12:43,629
You know one of the lost ships
has made it back to port.

136
00:12:43,734 --> 00:12:45,755
I'll pay you as soon as
my father returns.

137
00:12:45,862 --> 00:12:50,554
You know the law: If you can't pay,
I can sue your father for it.

138
00:12:50,661 --> 00:12:55,457
If your father can't pay,
I'll take his furnishings.

139
00:12:56,336 --> 00:12:59,921
Sign it.
What can you lose?

140
00:13:11,602 --> 00:13:13,437
What can I do, sir?

141
00:13:13,479 --> 00:13:17,211
If nothing's left from the last ship,
what's to become of me?

142
00:13:17,317 --> 00:13:20,923
Your creditors in the port were
quicker than those in town. Sue them.

143
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:24,261
I don't even have money
to stay at the inn in town.

144
00:13:24,367 --> 00:13:25,952
Then return home.

145
00:13:26,036 --> 00:13:29,225
Cross the forest in the dark of night?
I'll get lost.

146
00:13:29,332 --> 00:13:31,270
You crossed it at night to get here.

147
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:34,523
But there was a moon out then.
Now there's a fog.

148
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,610
I tell you, I'll get lost.
- Get lost, then!

149
00:13:36,716 --> 00:13:39,864
Easy for you to say!
I'd like to see you in my shoes.

150
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:41,555
It's frightening!

151
00:16:30,967 --> 00:16:33,052
Is anybody there?

152
00:16:57,715 --> 00:16:59,001
Is anyone there?

153
00:18:23,752 --> 00:18:25,362
Anybody there?

154
00:21:42,008 --> 00:21:43,718
Hello?

155
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,733
Hello?

156
00:23:05,901 --> 00:23:08,946
So, my dear sir,

157
00:23:11,157 --> 00:23:13,702
you steal my roses.

158
00:23:14,077 --> 00:23:16,328
You steal my roses,

159
00:23:16,413 --> 00:23:20,520
the things I love most
in all the world.

160
00:23:20,627 --> 00:23:22,648
Your luck has gone
from bad to worse.

161
00:23:22,753 --> 00:23:27,384
You could have taken anything -
except my roses.

162
00:23:27,844 --> 00:23:31,325
The punishment
for this simple theft

163
00:23:31,433 --> 00:23:33,059
is death!

164
00:23:33,184 --> 00:23:35,582
Sir, I didn't know.
I meant no harm.

165
00:23:35,687 --> 00:23:38,042
My daughter asked me
to bring her a rose.

166
00:23:38,149 --> 00:23:41,130
Don't address me as "sir."

167
00:23:41,667 --> 00:23:43,924
I'm called the beast!

168
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:47,159
I don't like compliments.

169
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:50,537
Don't try to understand.

170
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:53,166
You have 15 minutes

171
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:55,376
to prepare to die.

172
00:23:55,461 --> 00:23:57,379
- Sir-
- again!

173
00:23:57,421 --> 00:23:59,317
The beast orders you to be silent.

174
00:23:59,423 --> 00:24:02,572
You stole a rose,
so you must die.

175
00:24:02,677 --> 00:24:06,366
Unless one of your daughters -

176
00:24:06,472 --> 00:24:09,747
how many do you have?
- Three.

177
00:24:09,853 --> 00:24:14,627
Unless one of your daughters
agrees to pay your debt

178
00:24:14,733 --> 00:24:16,693
and take your place.

179
00:24:17,361 --> 00:24:19,697
Don't argue. Be off!

180
00:24:19,782 --> 00:24:22,445
Make the most of the chance
I've offered you.

181
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:25,891
And should your daughters refuse
to die in your place,

182
00:24:25,996 --> 00:24:29,353
swear to return in three days.
Swear it!

183
00:24:29,459 --> 00:24:32,177
I swear.

184
00:24:31,378 --> 00:24:35,194
But how will I find my way home?
I got lost in the forest.

185
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:38,323
You'll find a white horse
in my stables.

186
00:24:38,429 --> 00:24:40,660
His name is magnificent.

187
00:24:40,765 --> 00:24:44,747
Whisper in his ear,
"go where I am going, magnificent.

188
00:24:44,853 --> 00:24:47,689
Go, go, go!"

189
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:50,879
He'll take you home
and bring you back to my castle,

190
00:24:50,985 --> 00:24:54,674
should your daughters prove too cowardly
to ride him in your place.

191
00:24:54,781 --> 00:24:56,325
Go now!

192
00:25:35,706 --> 00:25:41,002
I don't remember if the journey
was quick or endless.

193
00:25:41,171 --> 00:25:45,091
Magnificent is in our stable.

194
00:25:44,592 --> 00:25:46,594
That's my story.

195
00:25:47,721 --> 00:25:50,952
Take this rose, Belle.

196
00:25:51,058 --> 00:25:53,764
It has cost me dear.

197
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:57,543
That's what happens when a fool
asks you to bring her a rose.

198
00:25:57,649 --> 00:25:59,838
See what her pride has caused!

199
00:25:59,944 --> 00:26:02,842
She tried to teach us a lesson
by acting the picture of modesty!

200
00:26:02,947 --> 00:26:05,594
She's not even crying!

201
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,724
You won't die, father.
It's my fault.

202
00:26:08,829 --> 00:26:11,185
It's only right that I go in your place.
- Are you crazy?

203
00:26:11,948 --> 00:26:14,773
Ludovic and I will go
and kill this awful beast!

204
00:26:14,878 --> 00:26:18,902
His power is too great.
You could never destroy him.

205
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:20,738
Don't you worry, Belle.

206
00:26:20,843 --> 00:26:25,078
I am old, and I gave my word.
I will go.

207
00:26:24,681 --> 00:26:28,480
You will not go, father.
You can still win your case.

208
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:32,065
- How will we get by?
- Sell my furniture.

209
00:26:32,859 --> 00:26:35,215
Why don't you go, Felicity?

210
00:26:36,193 --> 00:26:37,582
You're too tough to eat!

211
00:26:37,364 --> 00:26:39,761
Too bad the beast
doesn't want a boy.

212
00:26:39,867 --> 00:26:41,722
He could eat you
and die of poisoning!

213
00:26:41,828 --> 00:26:43,204
Children, please.

214
00:26:43,445 --> 00:26:46,665
Father, I'd rather be eaten alive
by that monster

215
00:26:46,375 --> 00:26:50,129
than die of grief at your loss.

216
00:26:51,089 --> 00:26:55,051
- You will not go to that monster!
- What business is it of yours?

217
00:26:55,344 --> 00:26:57,408
It's mine if I say it is!

218
00:26:57,513 --> 00:27:00,806
Do you love the little fool?
You make a fine pair!

219
00:27:00,392 --> 00:27:02,998
- Avenant, slap her!
- Calm down.

220
00:27:03,103 --> 00:27:05,959
Repeat what you just said.

221
00:27:06,065 --> 00:27:07,357
A pair of fools!

222
00:27:09,067 --> 00:27:11,882
He struck me!
- Brute! Scoundrel!

223
00:27:11,989 --> 00:27:16,179
- You dare slap my sister?
- You want one too? I've got plenty!

224
00:27:16,781 --> 00:27:18,704
Cheat! Thief!

225
00:27:18,747 --> 00:27:21,666
My children!

226
00:27:22,002 --> 00:27:25,964
- Ludovic, he's ill.
- Let's take him to his room.

227
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:49,178
- He struck me, Adelaide!
- We don't have a penny left.

228
00:27:49,698 --> 00:27:51,056
We mustn't lose our heads.

229
00:27:51,161 --> 00:27:55,499
The beast will devour them all,
and we'll marry princes!

230
00:28:40,429 --> 00:28:42,575
Go where I am going,
magnificent.

231
00:28:42,681 --> 00:28:44,682
Go, go, go!

232
00:31:28,881 --> 00:31:34,137
Belle, I am the door
to your room.

233
00:32:24,574 --> 00:32:28,472
I am your mirror, Belle.

234
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:33,624
Reflect in your heart for me,
and I will reflect for you.

235
00:33:27,107 --> 00:33:28,567
Where are you going?

236
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:25,256
Belle, you mustn't look
into my eyes.

237
00:36:25,542 --> 00:36:28,260
You needn't fear.
You will never see me,

238
00:36:28,573 --> 00:36:33,622
except each evening at 7:00,

239
00:36:34,081 --> 00:36:36,292
when you will dine,

240
00:36:36,655 --> 00:36:40,464
and I will come to the great hall.

241
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:46,639
And never look into my eyes.

242
00:37:41,162 --> 00:37:43,164
Don't be afraid.

243
00:37:43,164 --> 00:37:46,958
I'm not.

244
00:37:48,713 --> 00:37:53,509
Will you permit me
to watch you dine?

245
00:37:53,677 --> 00:37:55,345
You are the master.

246
00:38:00,477 --> 00:38:04,732
There is no master here but you.

247
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,328
I disgust you.

248
00:38:17,331 --> 00:38:20,646
You find me repulsive.

249
00:38:20,752 --> 00:38:23,254
I cannot lie, beast.

250
00:38:24,297 --> 00:38:27,653
Everything here is
at your command.

251
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,991
I don't feel at ease in all this finery,

252
00:38:31,097 --> 00:38:33,620
and I'm not used to being waited on.

253
00:38:33,725 --> 00:38:36,957
But I sense you are doing
everything possible

254
00:38:37,063 --> 00:38:41,275
to help me forget your ugliness.

255
00:38:51,121 --> 00:38:54,083
I have a good heart,

256
00:38:55,835 --> 00:39:00,283
but I am a monster.

257
00:38:59,715 --> 00:39:03,614
There are men
far more monstrous than you,

258
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,765
though they conceal it well.

259
00:39:07,182 --> 00:39:11,176
Besides being hideous,

260
00:39:10,562 --> 00:39:13,084
I'm not quick-witted.

261
00:39:13,189 --> 00:39:17,777
You're quick enough
to recognize it.

262
00:39:18,654 --> 00:39:23,117
Everything in this castle is yours.

263
00:39:23,493 --> 00:39:28,206
Make your slightest whim known.

264
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:42,559
I shall appear
every evening at 7:00.

265
00:39:44,144 --> 00:39:49,002
Then, before taking my leave,
I will ask you one question.

266
00:39:49,108 --> 00:39:51,005
Always the same question.

267
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:54,196
What is that question?

268
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,537
Will you be my wife?

269
00:40:02,248 --> 00:40:04,167
No, beast!

270
00:40:09,132 --> 00:40:13,788
Good-bye, then, Belle.

271
00:40:14,346 --> 00:40:16,181
Until tomorrow.

272
00:43:45,872 --> 00:43:49,062
Where is Belle?

273
00:44:34,326 --> 00:44:38,058
- Why are you in my room?
- I wanted - I was just -

274
00:44:38,164 --> 00:44:43,253
I came to bring you a gift.

275
00:44:45,644 --> 00:44:47,216
Get out!

276
00:44:58,147 --> 00:45:00,065
Get out.

277
00:47:29,329 --> 00:47:34,585
I thought you'd be
having supper, Belle.

278
00:47:34,961 --> 00:47:39,068
I'm not hungry.
I'd rather walk with you.

279
00:47:39,174 --> 00:47:44,596
You do me a great honor.

280
00:47:52,691 --> 00:47:55,735
A great honor.

281
00:47:56,362 --> 00:48:00,616
Your voice seems softer.

282
00:48:05,425 --> 00:48:09,270
Are your days here terribly boring?

283
00:48:09,377 --> 00:48:11,440
I do find the days long.

284
00:48:12,087 --> 00:48:16,717
I confess, this evening
I was looking forward to 7:00.

285
00:48:16,970 --> 00:48:20,284
Your kindness encourages me
to ask once again

286
00:48:20,390 --> 00:48:25,388
the question that torments my soul.

287
00:48:24,604 --> 00:48:28,335
Go ahead and ask.
My answer will always be the same.

288
00:48:28,443 --> 00:48:32,905
Let us be friends, beast.
Don't ask me for more.

289
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:37,785
And what do you do all day?

290
00:48:38,454 --> 00:48:41,436
Are you listening to me?

291
00:48:41,973 --> 00:48:43,669
I'm talking to you.

292
00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:49,174
Forgive me.

293
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:56,892
Where are you, beast?

294
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:02,190
Forgive me.

295
00:49:05,611 --> 00:49:07,696
It's nothing.

296
00:49:45,196 --> 00:49:46,703
What's the matter?

297
00:49:48,204 --> 00:49:50,665
I'm thirsty.

298
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:02,637
Drink from my hands.

299
00:50:16,692 --> 00:50:22,245
It doesn't repulse you
to let me drink from your hands?

300
00:50:22,912 --> 00:50:27,417
No, beast. I like it.

301
00:50:27,793 --> 00:50:31,882
I'd never want to cause you
the slightest harm.

302
00:50:34,876 --> 00:50:37,431
But still

303
00:50:39,336 --> 00:50:44,645
you dream of being
far away from me.

304
00:51:15,267 --> 00:51:17,478
You're very late.

305
00:51:18,104 --> 00:51:23,463
Thank you for noticing, Belle.

306
00:51:23,956 --> 00:51:28,010
I confess I was
very impatient to see you.

307
00:51:28,116 --> 00:51:31,180
I must speak with you!
- Belle!

308
00:51:31,288 --> 00:51:33,308
I can't live
without seeing my father.

309
00:51:33,414 --> 00:51:38,377
Please, let me go.
- Get up, Belle!

310
00:51:41,258 --> 00:51:45,740
It is I who should kneel

311
00:51:45,847 --> 00:51:47,995
and take orders from you.

312
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:52,103
Let me go and come back.

313
00:51:53,647 --> 00:51:56,150
When you return,

314
00:51:56,442 --> 00:51:58,236
will you be my wife?

315
00:52:00,923 --> 00:52:02,532
You're killing me.

316
00:52:02,992 --> 00:52:07,288
I know I'm horrible to look at.

317
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:13,273
But I would die of grief
if I let you go

318
00:52:13,379 --> 00:52:18,404
and you didn't return.

319
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:21,241
I'll return in a week.

320
00:52:21,347 --> 00:52:25,757
I care for you too much
to want to cause your death.

321
00:52:27,897 --> 00:52:29,858
You stroke me

322
00:52:31,067 --> 00:52:33,173
the way one strokes an animal.

323
00:52:33,278 --> 00:52:37,158
But you are an animal.

324
00:52:40,454 --> 00:52:45,229
What you ask is
a very serious matter.

325
00:52:45,334 --> 00:52:48,712
I must think about it.

326
00:52:53,454 --> 00:52:57,222
Will you walk with me
to the garden?

327
00:53:21,461 --> 00:53:25,151
Has another asked for your hand
in marriage?

328
00:53:25,258 --> 00:53:27,176
Yes, beast.

329
00:53:39,683 --> 00:53:43,528
Who proposed to you?

330
00:53:45,744 --> 00:53:47,764
A young man?

331
00:53:47,909 --> 00:53:50,120
Yes, beast.

332
00:53:50,785 --> 00:53:53,081
Was he handsome?

333
00:53:53,125 --> 00:53:55,376
Yes.

334
00:53:57,422 --> 00:53:59,902
Why didn't you marry him?

335
00:54:00,008 --> 00:54:03,928
I couldn't leave my father.

336
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:09,456
What was this handsome
young man's name?

337
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:11,861
Avenant.

338
00:54:25,121 --> 00:54:27,290
What's the matter?

339
00:54:28,541 --> 00:54:31,920
Beast, what's wrong?

340
00:55:13,512 --> 00:55:17,516
What are you doing
at my door at this hour?

341
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:21,564
Heavens!

342
00:55:22,304 --> 00:55:24,211
You're covered with blood!

343
00:55:24,317 --> 00:55:29,154
- Forgive me.
- What should I forgive you for?

344
00:55:31,952 --> 00:55:34,288
For being a beast.

345
00:55:37,038 --> 00:55:39,278
Forgive me.

346
00:55:41,922 --> 00:55:45,028
Those words are not worthy of you.

347
00:55:45,134 --> 00:55:47,177
Aren't you ashamed?

348
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:50,515
Clean yourself up

349
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:54,313
and go to bed.

350
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:03,197
Close your door!

351
00:56:07,036 --> 00:56:11,331
Quickly!
Close your door!

352
00:56:12,083 --> 00:56:15,397
Your look burns like fire.

353
00:56:15,505 --> 00:56:19,842
I cannot bear you
to look at me like that.

354
00:56:33,192 --> 00:56:34,964
They're taking everything.

355
00:56:35,069 --> 00:56:39,031
You'll see -
they'll take our table, too.

356
00:56:39,282 --> 00:56:41,243
Let's play.

357
00:56:44,288 --> 00:56:48,103
Go speak with your father.
He doesn't understand, of course.

358
00:56:48,210 --> 00:56:51,566
It's not my place
to tell him the truth.

359
00:56:52,394 --> 00:56:53,133
Go on.

360
00:57:17,328 --> 00:57:20,226
Ludovic, confess it was you.

361
00:57:20,332 --> 00:57:22,938
To tell the truth, yes, it was.

362
00:57:23,044 --> 00:57:26,547
Ludovic, this is your doing.

363
00:57:37,936 --> 00:57:41,460
The gentlemen's very ill.
You must leave him his bed.

364
00:57:41,567 --> 00:57:43,547
We always leave the beds.

365
00:57:44,083 --> 00:57:46,466
I bet you those women
find a way to keep their things.

366
00:57:46,572 --> 00:57:50,159
I have a guarantee
for your sisters.

367
00:57:54,082 --> 00:57:55,875
Give me a hand.

368
00:58:22,406 --> 00:58:24,116
Are you ill?

369
00:58:24,992 --> 00:58:28,913
Yes, beast, I am.

370
00:58:32,837 --> 00:58:34,254
What is it?

371
00:58:34,838 --> 00:58:37,508
My father is dying.

372
00:58:39,262 --> 00:58:42,408
I can't bear to see you ill.

373
00:58:42,515 --> 00:58:45,977
Send me home to my father.

374
00:58:46,436 --> 00:58:48,397
If I accept,

375
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:53,968
do you swear to return in a week?

376
00:58:56,239 --> 00:58:58,366
I swear.

377
00:59:06,835 --> 00:59:09,046
Come.

378
00:59:25,107 --> 00:59:28,235
Look over there, Belle.

379
00:59:28,570 --> 00:59:31,384
Do you see that pavilion?

380
00:59:31,491 --> 00:59:36,015
It's called Diana's pavilion.

381
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:41,187
It's the only place in my domain
where no one may enter.

382
00:59:41,293 --> 00:59:44,004
Not you and not I.

383
00:59:45,924 --> 00:59:52,140
All I possess,
I possess by the power of magic.

384
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:58,800
But my true riches
are in that pavilion,

385
00:59:58,941 --> 01:00:03,110
and one can only enter
with a golden key.

386
01:00:03,404 --> 01:00:05,614
Here it is, Belle.

387
01:00:08,117 --> 01:00:12,809
I give you the greatest possible
proof of trust

388
01:00:12,915 --> 01:00:17,044
that one can give in this world.

389
01:00:17,921 --> 01:00:21,195
If you do not return,

390
01:00:21,301 --> 01:00:23,428
I will die.

391
01:00:26,077 --> 01:00:28,058
After my death,

392
01:00:29,184 --> 01:00:31,957
you will be safely out of danger,

393
01:00:32,064 --> 01:00:34,419
and my riches will be yours.

394
01:00:34,524 --> 01:00:37,361
Take the key.

395
01:00:38,445 --> 01:00:41,365
I know your soul.

396
01:00:41,449 --> 01:00:45,389
This key, delivered into your hands,

397
01:00:45,495 --> 01:00:48,518
will be the pledge of your return.

398
01:00:48,625 --> 01:00:52,148
Then you agree to send me back
to my father?

399
01:00:52,254 --> 01:00:54,234
You'll be there this very morning.

400
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:58,573
Night is not the same here
as where you come from.

401
01:00:58,994 --> 01:01:01,056
Here, it's night.

402
01:01:01,974 --> 01:01:06,064
In your world, it's day.

403
01:01:13,488 --> 01:01:16,552
A rose with its role to play,

404
01:01:16,757 --> 01:01:20,432
my mirror, my golden key,

405
01:01:20,537 --> 01:01:23,268
my horse and my glove

406
01:01:23,374 --> 01:01:27,898
are the five secrets of my power.

407
01:01:28,006 --> 01:01:30,444
I entrust them to you.

408
01:01:30,549 --> 01:01:34,990
You have only to put this glove
on your right hand

409
01:01:35,097 --> 01:01:39,935
and you'll be transported
wherever you wish.

410
01:01:49,955 --> 01:01:54,578
Remember your promise.

411
01:02:03,226 --> 01:02:05,508
Farewell, Belle.

412
01:03:18,096 --> 01:03:20,786
- I'm dreaming.
- No, father, you're not.

413
01:03:20,891 --> 01:03:22,454
It's really me - Belle.

414
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:25,041
Thinking you were dead,
I myself was dying.

415
01:03:25,146 --> 01:03:30,129
Did you escape?
- No, the beast let me come see you.

416
01:03:30,236 --> 01:03:33,884
- Then that monster has a soul?
- He suffers.

417
01:03:33,990 --> 01:03:36,971
One half of him is in constant
struggle with the other half.

418
01:03:37,077 --> 01:03:40,308
He's more cruel to himself
than he is to human beings.

419
01:03:40,414 --> 01:03:42,812
Belle, I saw him.
That face is hideous.

420
01:03:42,917 --> 01:03:46,232
At first I was indeed afraid, father.

421
01:03:46,338 --> 01:03:50,070
Now I sometimes feel
like bursting out laughing.

422
01:03:50,176 --> 01:03:53,157
But then I look into his eyes,

423
01:03:53,263 --> 01:03:55,224
and they're so sad

424
01:03:55,266 --> 01:03:57,330
that I have to turn away
to keep from crying.

425
01:03:57,435 --> 01:04:00,542
Don't tell me you've agreed
to live with that monster!

426
01:04:00,648 --> 01:04:02,942
I must, father.

427
01:04:03,025 --> 01:04:07,216
Certain powers obey him,
while there are others he must obey.

428
01:04:07,322 --> 01:04:11,513
If I ran away, I'd cause great harm
to him - and to you.

429
01:04:11,619 --> 01:04:13,307
Does he threaten you?

430
01:04:13,413 --> 01:04:17,019
He comes to me only at times when
his cruelty is not too frightening.

431
01:04:17,126 --> 01:04:21,191
Sometimes his bearing
is almost noble.

432
01:04:21,297 --> 01:04:26,321
Other times, he's unsteady
and seems stricken with some infirmity.

433
01:04:26,428 --> 01:04:29,158
You manage to feel sorry for him?

434
01:04:29,265 --> 01:04:31,601
I bear his presence,

435
01:04:31,642 --> 01:04:34,874
because I'd be happy if I could
make him forget his ugliness.

436
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:39,254
Your goodness will cost you dearly,
my Belle.

437
01:04:39,361 --> 01:04:44,116
Father, that monster is good.

438
01:04:46,286 --> 01:04:49,998
My heavens!
A diamond!

439
01:04:53,586 --> 01:04:55,254
And another.

440
01:04:55,422 --> 01:04:57,944
Proof that the spirits
are keeping him safe

441
01:04:58,050 --> 01:04:59,863
because I cried for him.

442
01:04:59,968 --> 01:05:02,032
These diamonds could be
the devil's work.

443
01:05:02,138 --> 01:05:05,369
Put your mind at ease, father.
They are yours to keep.

444
01:05:05,475 --> 01:05:08,539
He's given them to you.
They'll bring you life.

445
01:05:08,645 --> 01:05:12,211
But if you tell my sisters,
they'll take the diamonds

446
01:05:12,317 --> 01:05:15,612
and leave you with nothing.

447
01:05:35,512 --> 01:05:37,952
I'd rather sleep in sheets
than hang them up.

448
01:05:38,057 --> 01:05:40,016
Look at my hands!

449
01:05:40,101 --> 01:05:41,936
Appalling!

450
01:05:41,978 --> 01:05:45,417
Look at mine!
Reduced to being a cook!

451
01:05:45,524 --> 01:05:49,339
My dear princesses,
when you're poor, you work!

452
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:52,551
- Imbecile!
- You should talk, you swindler!

453
01:05:52,657 --> 01:05:55,513
If it weren't for you,
we'd still have a servant.

454
01:05:55,619 --> 01:05:57,496
It was my fault.

455
01:05:58,081 --> 01:06:00,894
Kindly take note that
I am paying for it in the flesh.

456
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:06,006
When you're not drinking
or gambling.

457
01:06:06,592 --> 01:06:09,446
Such charming creatures!

458
01:06:09,553 --> 01:06:12,158
How is your father this morning?

459
01:06:12,265 --> 01:06:15,893
You think they take care of him?

460
01:06:16,102 --> 01:06:18,916
I'm the one looking after him.

461
01:06:19,022 --> 01:06:22,379
He's still very weak
and cannot stand.

462
01:06:22,485 --> 01:06:26,259
Felicity, Adelaide, Ludovic!

463
01:06:26,364 --> 01:06:28,408
For heaven's sake!

464
01:06:30,202 --> 01:06:33,100
An elegant woman,
and father standing at her side!

465
01:06:33,205 --> 01:06:35,102
And us without our finery!

466
01:06:35,208 --> 01:06:37,002
It's Belle!

467
01:06:37,210 --> 01:06:41,256
- Belle? Impossible.
- But it is.

468
01:06:47,056 --> 01:06:49,141
Go away!

469
01:06:49,225 --> 01:06:51,101
As charming as ever.

470
01:06:53,606 --> 01:06:56,497
Belle came to my room
and restored me to health.

471
01:06:55,902 --> 01:06:58,528
Where did you come from?

472
01:06:59,989 --> 01:07:03,408
What a magnificent necklace!

473
01:07:04,243 --> 01:07:05,598
You take it, Felicity.

474
01:07:05,703 --> 01:07:09,218
It will look even more
magnificent on you.

475
01:07:08,875 --> 01:07:12,544
- My god!
- Drop it this instant!

476
01:07:19,011 --> 01:07:22,284
The beast meant it for you alone.

477
01:07:22,389 --> 01:07:25,454
You can't give it to anyone else.

478
01:07:25,561 --> 01:07:30,358
Come, Adelaide, let's get dressed.
What must we look like?

479
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:34,904
Good-bye, my lovelies!

480
01:07:44,626 --> 01:07:46,336
Who did my washing?

481
01:07:46,378 --> 01:07:48,297
We did.

482
01:07:50,008 --> 01:07:52,070
The sheets are dragging
on the ground.

483
01:07:52,176 --> 01:07:55,157
So, he's not a ferocious beast?

484
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:57,994
No, he's a good beast.

485
01:07:58,100 --> 01:08:00,539
You're not going back, are you?

486
01:08:00,644 --> 01:08:02,291
Yes, Avenant. I promised.

487
01:08:02,397 --> 01:08:04,544
The beast freed me
for just one week.

488
01:08:04,649 --> 01:08:09,946
If I don't return,
he'll die of grief.

489
01:08:10,197 --> 01:08:12,242
Do you love him?

490
01:08:12,326 --> 01:08:14,661
No, Avenant.

491
01:08:15,203 --> 01:08:17,331
I'm fond of him.

492
01:08:17,916 --> 01:08:20,981
It's not the same thing.

493
01:08:21,085 --> 01:08:24,153
The church tribunal will be
quite interested

494
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:27,926
in the display of witchcraft
we just witnessed.

495
01:08:28,512 --> 01:08:30,473
Good-bye for now.

496
01:08:35,646 --> 01:08:37,168
Let's go in the shed.

497
01:08:37,272 --> 01:08:40,838
We can have a serious talk now.
They won't hear us.

498
01:08:40,944 --> 01:08:42,571
So tell us.

499
01:08:50,497 --> 01:08:53,561
He's entrusted me
with the key to his treasure.

500
01:08:53,667 --> 01:08:56,481
He has complete confidence in me.

501
01:08:56,587 --> 01:08:59,512
I'd be the monster
if I were to not return.

502
01:08:58,923 --> 01:09:01,612
How many servants wait on you?

503
01:09:01,718 --> 01:09:03,532
Invisible hands serve me.

504
01:09:03,638 --> 01:09:05,575
They dress me
and arrange my hair.

505
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:08,995
They open and close the doors.
I never see a soul.

506
01:09:09,101 --> 01:09:11,457
Does this beast speak
the language of men?

507
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:14,211
Yes. He speaks like you and me.

508
01:09:14,317 --> 01:09:18,705
Does he crawl on four legs?
What does he eat and drink?

509
01:09:17,947 --> 01:09:21,659
I've given him water
to drink on occasion.

510
01:09:21,951 --> 01:09:25,164
He would never eat me.

511
01:09:27,959 --> 01:09:30,522
- Can you imagine?
- Incredible.

512
01:09:30,628 --> 01:09:34,193
That little fool is happier
than we are. She's rich!

513
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:36,863
There are a lot of other husbands
with beards and horns.

514
01:09:36,970 --> 01:09:40,200
- She's so proud she could burst.
- Don't worry.

515
01:09:40,307 --> 01:09:43,204
I've got a good head
on these shoulders.

516
01:09:43,311 --> 01:09:45,248
We'll be very friendly

517
01:09:45,354 --> 01:09:48,649
and let the boys worm
the information out of her.

518
01:09:49,984 --> 01:09:52,946
How much do you have on you?

519
01:09:54,157 --> 01:09:57,993
There. It's frightening.

520
01:09:58,288 --> 01:10:02,315
We must act.
I've come to a decision.

521
01:10:01,918 --> 01:10:04,981
There's nothing more we can do.

522
01:10:05,086 --> 01:10:09,360
I can't stand the idea of Belle
returning to that beast tomorrow.

523
01:10:09,466 --> 01:10:11,260
We must kill him.

524
01:10:11,303 --> 01:10:13,031
And take his treasure.

525
01:10:13,139 --> 01:10:17,143
But do you realize
we're dealing with magic powers?

526
01:10:17,559 --> 01:10:19,998
I don't believe in magic powers.

527
01:10:20,104 --> 01:10:22,336
The beast hypnotizes her
to see what he wants her to.

528
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:24,150
I'm scared.

529
01:10:24,485 --> 01:10:28,384
No power in the world can frighten me
when it comes to rescuing Belle.

530
01:10:28,489 --> 01:10:30,386
Besides, we have no choice.

531
01:10:30,491 --> 01:10:33,057
Convince your sisters
there's something in it for them.

532
01:10:33,161 --> 01:10:35,350
They'll stop Belle from leaving.

533
01:10:35,456 --> 01:10:38,228
Dazzle them with the treasure.

534
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:41,023
How will you ever find
the beast's castle?

535
01:10:41,130 --> 01:10:43,257
I'll ask Belle.

536
01:10:43,342 --> 01:10:46,511
I'll pry the secret out of her.

537
01:10:57,108 --> 01:11:01,006
We'll rub our eyes with onions
to make us cry.

538
01:11:01,112 --> 01:11:03,197
She'll smell it.

539
01:11:03,283 --> 01:11:05,178
Ludovic's ideas are always
so distasteful!

540
01:11:05,284 --> 01:11:07,390
The little fool's
too stupid to notice.

541
01:11:07,495 --> 01:11:11,499
Ludovic's idea isn't so dumb.
Help me.

542
01:11:13,044 --> 01:11:14,629
Delightful.

543
01:11:14,711 --> 01:11:16,673
Hurry up!

544
01:11:25,516 --> 01:11:29,687
Belle, you mustn't leave us.
You can't go.

545
01:11:30,606 --> 01:11:32,651
Stay here with us.

546
01:11:32,733 --> 01:11:34,923
We haven't always been fair to you,

547
01:11:35,028 --> 01:11:38,301
but now that we might lose you,
we realize how much we love you.

548
01:11:38,407 --> 01:11:39,491
Are you crying?

549
01:11:39,576 --> 01:11:43,640
If the beast really loves you,
he'll let you stay longer.

550
01:11:43,747 --> 01:11:47,188
- Stay another week.
- Impossible.

551
01:11:47,293 --> 01:11:51,214
Do you want your father
and sisters to die of grief?

552
01:11:51,382 --> 01:11:53,967
Stay with us, Belle.

553
01:11:54,050 --> 01:11:57,615
- I can't.
- Don't be like that. Stay!

554
01:11:57,723 --> 01:12:00,688
Adelaide, my little sister.

555
01:11:59,974 --> 01:12:01,455
Adelaide was just saying,

556
01:12:01,559 --> 01:12:05,416
"now I see who our Belle really is.
I'll die if she leaves us."

557
01:12:05,523 --> 01:12:10,255
- Don't tempt me.
- Don't leave us tomorrow.

558
01:12:10,363 --> 01:12:14,385
Explain to the beast
it's your sisters' fault.

559
01:12:14,492 --> 01:12:18,057
I didn't know
you loved me so much.

560
01:12:18,164 --> 01:12:20,499
You're an angel!

561
01:12:22,627 --> 01:12:24,671
We're so happy.

562
01:12:26,715 --> 01:12:30,511
We're so very, very happy!

563
01:12:35,684 --> 01:12:37,228
She's crying.

564
01:12:37,311 --> 01:12:40,000
She'll stay,
and we'll share the treasure.

565
01:12:40,106 --> 01:12:43,692
Let's go and wash.
You stink!

566
01:12:44,361 --> 01:12:46,466
- Well?
- Well, what?

567
01:12:46,572 --> 01:12:48,219
- Is she staying?
- Yes.

568
01:12:48,324 --> 01:12:50,596
- Do you have the key?
- Give it here.

569
01:12:50,702 --> 01:12:53,434
- What do you take me for?
- We know what you'll do. It's gold!

570
01:12:53,539 --> 01:12:55,310
- You idiot!
- Don't start again.

571
01:12:55,416 --> 01:12:57,395
I'll give it to Avenant
if he decides to go.

572
01:12:57,503 --> 01:13:01,150
You women are too much!
Where's he going to go, and how?

573
01:13:01,258 --> 01:13:04,343
We'll let him figure that out!

574
01:13:06,263 --> 01:13:08,348
Belle, you seem sad.

575
01:13:08,516 --> 01:13:10,394
No, father.

576
01:13:11,228 --> 01:13:14,333
She misses her luxuries.
Our banality disgusts her.

577
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:16,359
Felicity!

578
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:21,405
The beast undoubtedly possesses
charms that we lack.

579
01:13:22,074 --> 01:13:26,954
Mademoiselle must think
she's too grand to wait on us now.

580
01:13:40,636 --> 01:13:43,243
What have they done to you now?

581
01:13:43,348 --> 01:13:45,267
It was your sisters.

582
01:13:45,352 --> 01:13:48,207
They don't waste any time,
the wretches!

583
01:13:48,314 --> 01:13:50,733
Belle, listen to me.

584
01:13:53,278 --> 01:13:55,323
Don't cry.

585
01:13:56,615 --> 01:13:59,137
I must wake you
from this nightmare.

586
01:13:59,243 --> 01:14:01,098
I have to take you away.

587
01:14:01,203 --> 01:14:04,560
I know what you're thinking,
that I'm just a scoundrel.

588
01:14:04,666 --> 01:14:09,525
But at your side I will work!
We'll leave this town and these taverns.

589
01:14:09,631 --> 01:14:13,593
Answer me.
What is it?

590
01:14:15,137 --> 01:14:17,034
I see - it's the beast.

591
01:14:17,139 --> 01:14:21,560
Tell me how to reach his castle,
and I'll go and kill him.

592
01:14:24,064 --> 01:14:26,024
You don't answer.

593
01:14:27,444 --> 01:14:32,218
I knew it.
He's worked some charm on you.

594
01:14:32,326 --> 01:14:35,431
Or else that heart of yours
that I know so well

595
01:14:35,537 --> 01:14:38,184
cannot bring itself
to wish him evil.

596
01:14:38,291 --> 01:14:43,649
Belle, I assure you,
if that monster suffered as I do,

597
01:14:43,756 --> 01:14:48,029
he would rush to your side
and carry you off with him.

598
01:14:48,137 --> 01:14:53,017
I assure you,
he's forgotten you.

599
01:17:25,615 --> 01:17:28,306
Come in, quick.
They won't find us here.

600
01:17:28,411 --> 01:17:32,165
You're late, as usual.

601
01:17:37,216 --> 01:17:38,342
Well?

602
01:17:38,382 --> 01:17:41,489
My mind's made up.
There's no going back.

603
01:17:41,594 --> 01:17:44,575
That's fine, but how will we get
to the beast's castle?

604
01:17:44,682 --> 01:17:47,079
Didn't you find out her secret?

605
01:17:47,184 --> 01:17:49,080
She only says
what the beast allows her to.

606
01:17:49,188 --> 01:17:52,001
We know all the other details,
but she wouldn't tell us that.

607
01:17:52,107 --> 01:17:55,964
I'll get it out of her.
I'll torture her!

608
01:17:56,070 --> 01:17:59,448
Do that and you can count me out.

609
01:17:59,741 --> 01:18:01,451
What's that?

610
01:18:03,328 --> 01:18:05,163
I'll go and see.

611
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:27,607
A lone white horse.

612
01:18:28,698 --> 01:18:30,839
It's magnificent.
I'm sure of it!

613
01:18:31,729 --> 01:18:34,199
He jumped the fence
and entered the courtyard.

614
01:18:38,622 --> 01:18:41,060
Heaven sent him to us.

615
01:18:41,166 --> 01:18:43,855
- Hell, more likely.
- I'm afraid.

616
01:18:43,962 --> 01:18:46,984
Shut up, idiot!
Bring the horse in, quietly.

617
01:18:47,089 --> 01:18:48,986
Don't anyone go out there.

618
01:18:49,092 --> 01:18:51,052
I'm going.

619
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:33,582
The beast sent him here to get Belle.
Perfect timing!

620
01:19:33,687 --> 01:19:37,461
The horse will take
you and Ludovic instead.

621
01:19:37,567 --> 01:19:40,792
- It's all right for you to talk!
- Are you a man or a woman?

622
01:19:40,071 --> 01:19:44,116
- I'd like to see you go.
- We've no time to lose.

623
01:19:46,994 --> 01:19:51,332
Get on behind me, Ludovic.
- God save us!

624
01:19:52,668 --> 01:19:54,463
Your bows!

625
01:19:56,006 --> 01:19:58,153
What's that in my way?

626
01:19:58,259 --> 01:19:59,427
A sack.

627
01:19:59,511 --> 01:20:03,598
If it's gold, it'll change to straw
if I touch it. You open it.

628
01:20:04,183 --> 01:20:05,350
A mirror!

629
01:20:05,435 --> 01:20:08,332
To reflect the ugly heart of a girl
who breaks her promises.

630
01:20:08,439 --> 01:20:11,278
See? The beast isn't
so stupid after all.

631
01:20:11,025 --> 01:20:14,654
Here's the key.
Off you go, and good luck.

632
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:19,094
- I forgot the magic words.
- It's something like "go, go, go."

633
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:21,597
We'd be in fine shape
if we had to count on you.

634
01:20:21,705 --> 01:20:25,625
"Go where I am going, magnificent.
Go, go, go."

635
01:20:39,434 --> 01:20:41,477
Ludovic!

636
01:20:43,063 --> 01:20:45,627
What's wrong with you?

637
01:20:45,733 --> 01:20:48,172
Have we sent them to their deaths?

638
01:20:48,277 --> 01:20:49,821
Fool!

639
01:20:50,030 --> 01:20:51,282
The mirror!

640
01:20:58,582 --> 01:21:00,352
I have an uneasy feeling.

641
01:21:00,459 --> 01:21:03,629
Look at yourself.
You're green!

642
01:21:05,465 --> 01:21:07,259
Look!

643
01:21:09,670 --> 01:21:12,326
What do you see?
- Nothing.

644
01:21:12,431 --> 01:21:16,478
Let's take it to Belle.
It's her turn.

645
01:21:25,572 --> 01:21:28,053
Mademoiselle dresses up
like a princess

646
01:21:28,159 --> 01:21:30,139
when she thinks she's all alone, eh?

647
01:21:30,246 --> 01:21:32,268
Who do you think you are?

648
01:21:32,373 --> 01:21:36,229
This mirror was mysteriously left
for you on the doorstep.

649
01:21:36,336 --> 01:21:40,756
You'll see what kind of beauty
pleases a beast!

650
01:23:18,083 --> 01:23:20,044
The key!

651
01:23:30,765 --> 01:23:32,432
The key!

652
01:23:39,610 --> 01:23:41,487
Where is it?

653
01:24:08,644 --> 01:24:10,770
My beast!

654
01:24:31,631 --> 01:24:33,632
My beast!

655
01:24:48,692 --> 01:24:50,693
Answer me, beast!

656
01:25:05,544 --> 01:25:07,254
Forgive me.

657
01:25:10,469 --> 01:25:14,597
Answer me, beast.
Look at me.

658
01:25:15,350 --> 01:25:18,686
Your glove will revive you.

659
01:25:21,190 --> 01:25:23,233
Help me.

660
01:25:26,071 --> 01:25:28,531
I am the monster.

661
01:25:29,699 --> 01:25:33,621
You will live.
- Too late.

662
01:25:43,632 --> 01:25:46,905
- Are we there?
- Yes.

663
01:25:47,588 --> 01:25:51,474
First we have to kill the beast.
- We'll take care of that later.

664
01:25:58,319 --> 01:26:00,195
Do you have the key?

665
01:26:05,494 --> 01:26:07,119
Stop.

666
01:26:08,121 --> 01:26:11,603
That golden key could set off
some diabolical device.

667
01:26:11,709 --> 01:26:15,170
We have to be careful.
- Right.

668
01:26:15,380 --> 01:26:19,467
We won't use the door.
Follow me.

669
01:26:32,316 --> 01:26:33,735
Climb up.

670
01:26:35,362 --> 01:26:38,093
Be brave!
You're scared, as usual.

671
01:26:38,198 --> 01:26:40,136
I'm not scared.
I'm just thinking.

672
01:26:40,243 --> 01:26:42,121
Same thing.

673
01:26:51,508 --> 01:26:53,801
Are you coming?

674
01:26:59,266 --> 01:27:02,769
- Where are we?
- On some kind of glass panels.

675
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:14,660
Look!

676
01:27:15,244 --> 01:27:17,537
Amazing!

677
01:27:22,419 --> 01:27:24,462
What's that?

678
01:27:26,756 --> 01:27:28,258
It's Diana.

679
01:27:28,342 --> 01:27:30,808
Don't be a coward!

680
01:27:30,137 --> 01:27:33,159
Use those powerful claws
to hold on to life!

681
01:27:33,266 --> 01:27:36,496
Fight! Get up
and let out a roar!

682
01:27:36,602 --> 01:27:38,604
Scare death away!

683
01:27:38,688 --> 01:27:40,398
Belle,

684
01:27:43,110 --> 01:27:45,362
if I were a man...

685
01:27:47,199 --> 01:27:53,248
perhaps I could do as you say.

686
01:27:56,251 --> 01:27:59,088
But poor beasts

687
01:28:00,213 --> 01:28:03,800
who wish to prove their love

688
01:28:04,178 --> 01:28:09,684
can only grovel on the ground

689
01:28:12,269 --> 01:28:14,271
and die.

690
01:28:24,577 --> 01:28:27,747
- I'll break the glass.
- Be careful.

691
01:28:36,232 --> 01:28:38,343
Glass is just glass.

692
01:28:40,472 --> 01:28:42,557
Hold on to my hands.

693
01:28:42,640 --> 01:28:45,523
I'll lower myself down
and jump to the ground.

694
01:28:45,142 --> 01:28:47,414
- It's too high.
- I'll jump.

695
01:28:47,522 --> 01:28:52,317
- How do we get the treasure out?
- Don't worry. First we have to get in.

696
01:28:53,278 --> 01:28:57,657
Stand firm and get a good grip.

697
01:29:06,294 --> 01:29:09,859
Wait a minute.
Don't let go yet.

698
01:29:09,965 --> 01:29:13,199
Don't let go until I tell you.

699
01:29:27,652 --> 01:29:29,655
Where is the beast?

700
01:29:33,786 --> 01:29:37,433
He is no more.
It was I, Belle.

701
01:29:37,539 --> 01:29:39,561
My parents didn't believe
in magic spirits,

702
01:29:39,666 --> 01:29:43,440
so the spirits took their revenge
through me.

703
01:29:43,547 --> 01:29:47,735
I could only be saved

704
01:29:47,178 --> 01:29:50,180
by a loving look.

705
01:29:51,641 --> 01:29:56,457
Can such miracles really happen?

706
01:29:56,563 --> 01:29:59,251
You and I are living proof.

707
01:29:59,357 --> 01:30:04,425
Love can turn
a man into a beast.

708
01:30:04,530 --> 01:30:09,494
But love can also make
an ugly man handsome.

709
01:30:10,162 --> 01:30:12,499
What's wrong, Belle?

710
01:30:12,540 --> 01:30:15,479
It's almost as if
you miss my ugliness.

711
01:30:15,585 --> 01:30:19,452
It's not that, my lord.

712
01:30:19,256 --> 01:30:23,274
But you look like someone
I used to know.

713
01:30:23,135 --> 01:30:24,762
Who?

714
01:30:24,846 --> 01:30:26,807
My brother's friend.

715
01:30:27,350 --> 01:30:29,351
Did you love him?

716
01:30:29,645 --> 01:30:31,355
Yes.

717
01:30:33,357 --> 01:30:35,277
Did he know?

718
01:30:39,197 --> 01:30:42,595
But you did love the beast?

719
01:30:42,702 --> 01:30:44,829
Yes.

720
01:30:49,168 --> 01:30:53,464
You're a strange girl, Belle.

721
01:30:54,258 --> 01:30:56,468
A strange girl.

722
01:30:58,851 --> 01:31:00,639
At your service.

723
01:31:01,349 --> 01:31:06,478
Are you disappointed
that I look like your brother's friend?

724
01:31:07,523 --> 01:31:09,274
Yes.

725
01:31:17,661 --> 01:31:20,933
The first time
I took you in my arms,

726
01:31:21,246 --> 01:31:23,266
I was the beast.

727
01:31:26,717 --> 01:31:28,214
Are you happy?

728
01:31:28,716 --> 01:31:32,198
I'll have to get used to it.

729
01:31:32,303 --> 01:31:34,159
Where will you take me?

730
01:31:34,263 --> 01:31:39,849
To my kingdom,
where you'll be a great queen.

731
01:31:39,853 --> 01:31:42,625
There you'll be reunited
with your father,

732
01:31:42,733 --> 01:31:46,130
and your sisters
will carry the train of your gown.

733
01:31:46,235 --> 01:31:47,737
Is it far?

734
01:31:47,822 --> 01:31:51,367
We'll fly through the air.

735
01:31:54,245 --> 01:31:56,726
You won't be frightened?

736
01:31:56,833 --> 01:32:00,418
I don't mind being frightened...

737
01:32:01,654 --> 01:32:02,714
with you.

738
01:32:41,428 --> 01:32:44,262
I'm taking you away.

739
01:32:46,644 --> 01:32:48,354
Off we go.

740
01:32:49,019 --> 01:32:59,019
