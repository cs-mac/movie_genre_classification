00:00:10,988 --> 00:00:13,307
Episode 15

2
00:00:16,307 --> 00:00:20,570
Da Mi's heart seems to have been hurt.

3
00:00:21,106 --> 00:00:23,144
What happened?

4
00:00:24,874 --> 00:00:29,715
She thinks that I abandoned her.

5
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:34,604
Isn't that the truth?

6
00:00:37,687 --> 00:00:41,570
I thought that you abandoned me.

7
00:00:41,701 --> 00:00:44,821
No matter how angry I was or
how much I wanted to break up,

8
00:00:44,933 --> 00:00:49,199
even if I had made it seem as though
I never wanted to see you again,

9
00:00:49,323 --> 00:00:51,898
if you really had the intention to come back to me,

10
00:00:52,017 --> 00:00:56,368
you would have been able to break it off over there.

11
00:00:57,823 --> 00:00:59,993
Was that what you had hoped for?

12
00:01:00,091 --> 00:01:02,982
I thought I had done what you wanted.

13
00:01:03,042 --> 00:01:06,578
When a woman who views her husband as her everything,

14
00:01:06,652 --> 00:01:10,359
finds out that he has another wife,

15
00:01:10,463 --> 00:01:13,446
what else is there to say?

16
00:01:16,846 --> 00:01:22,617
Then, I was thirty.

17
00:01:22,968 --> 00:01:27,018
You were thirty-two.

18
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:34,939
It seems like it was very hard for you
and I to understand one another.

19
00:01:36,778 --> 00:01:41,640
What thoughts do you have about Da Mi?

20
00:01:47,763 --> 00:01:50,232
I want to do everything I can for her.

21
00:01:50,322 --> 00:01:52,996
As long as you allow it.

22
00:01:55,063 --> 00:01:59,932
It'd be good if you took her to Japan too.

23
00:02:02,201 --> 00:02:03,816
If she wants to make up her mind to study,

24
00:02:03,908 --> 00:02:08,110
it might be hard for her because there
are so many people here that she knows.

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,543
Although she says she'll no longer be an actress,

26
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:15,473
but for now the things mentioned on
the Internet will not settle down.

27
00:02:16,563 --> 00:02:21,176
I think that the best choice is to
put her in a different setting.

28
00:02:24,322 --> 00:02:27,385
Her Japanese is already pretty good.

29
00:02:28,101 --> 00:02:30,005
What do you think?

30
00:02:30,018 --> 00:02:34,736
Would you be okay without Da Mi?

31
00:02:35,926 --> 00:02:39,660
I'll be fine. It won't be a problem.

32
00:02:42,467 --> 00:02:45,951
I have to work.

33
00:02:47,202 --> 00:02:49,952
And I'm going to get married.

34
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:45,290
Da Mi.

35
00:03:52,564 --> 00:03:55,849
What's going on with my daughter? Let Mom see.

36
00:04:05,244 --> 00:04:08,822
Did Dad make you sad?

37
00:04:11,225 --> 00:04:13,471
Then why are you sad?

38
00:04:15,374 --> 00:04:17,028
Why are you crying?

39
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,732
Like a silly fool.

40
00:04:20,203 --> 00:04:21,855
Mom.

41
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:23,904
What's wrong?

42
00:04:24,526 --> 00:04:27,569
It's about Dad's home in Japan.

43
00:04:28,217 --> 00:04:29,219
Yes.

44
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:34,763
It's like the home we used to have.

45
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:39,957
Mom, Dad, and me.

46
00:04:40,593 --> 00:04:43,263
The home with the three of us together.

47
00:04:46,278 --> 00:04:49,361
Dad looks very happy in that home.

48
00:04:51,044 --> 00:04:57,137
I had thought that Dad would be missing Mom and me.

49
00:04:58,566 --> 00:05:01,643
Living very depressed everyday.

50
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:08,998
I thought that he'd be living with
an ahjumma that he didn't like.

51
00:05:11,285 --> 00:05:18,969
Imagining Dad like this, I was able to forget my own
feelings of loneliness from those twelve years.

52
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,536
Dad loves that ahjumma.

53
00:05:26,156 --> 00:05:28,600
Mom knows that, right?

54
00:05:30,117 --> 00:05:31,162
Da Mi.

55
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:32,609
Hmm?

56
00:05:33,503 --> 00:05:38,114
Even though your dad and I separated in that way,

57
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:44,560
I never wanted your father to have an unhappy marriage.

58
00:05:46,068 --> 00:05:53,310
Dad was definitely a good husband and will be a great father.

59
00:05:54,913 --> 00:06:00,422
No matter where he is at, he will sincerely do his best in everything.

60
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,420
That's the type of person he is.

61
00:06:02,477 --> 00:06:04,998
Mom, be honest.

62
00:06:05,912 --> 00:06:08,857
You really don't care?

63
00:06:10,292 --> 00:06:12,734
I feel really awful.

64
00:06:12,921 --> 00:06:14,750
I understand how you feel.

65
00:06:14,842 --> 00:06:17,344
At your age, of course it will be hard.

66
00:06:17,506 --> 00:06:19,187
But...

67
00:06:20,676 --> 00:06:23,268
Because your father is that type of person,

68
00:06:23,391 --> 00:06:26,146
that's why I loved him.

69
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,402
Dad…

70
00:06:27,405 --> 00:06:31,437
Don't say anymore, Mom. Forget about it.

71
00:06:32,222 --> 00:06:33,180
Da Mi.

72
00:06:33,187 --> 00:06:39,441
No matter where he is at, he will sincerely do his best in everything.

73
00:06:41,433 --> 00:06:45,326
In these past twelve years, I never even got to see his face.

74
00:06:45,608 --> 00:06:48,095
That was because Mom didn't let him come.

75
00:06:48,146 --> 00:06:52,737
If he really wanted to see me,

76
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:57,520
he would have come no matter what, right?

77
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,594
Mom, are you inside?

78
00:07:48,985 --> 00:07:51,878
Oh, Mom's washing her face.

79
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:29,731
Are you okay?

80
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:31,578
I'm fine.

81
00:08:31,863 --> 00:08:34,382
You didn't have much to eat, so then why would it hurt?

82
00:08:34,961 --> 00:08:39,347
They say if you eat knowing you're going to get
indigestion, it'll be worse. Don't worry about it.

83
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:43,819
Is it because you feel uneasy having seen Dad?

84
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:46,721
No.

85
00:09:01,762 --> 00:09:03,007
Da Mi.

86
00:09:03,862 --> 00:09:05,079
Hmm?

87
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:13,035
You think Mom hates Dad, don't you?

88
00:09:15,145 --> 00:09:17,783
It's Dad's fault, isn't it?

89
00:09:19,828 --> 00:09:21,360
It is.

90
00:09:24,035 --> 00:09:28,114
Mom doesn't want to understand him either.

91
00:09:29,818 --> 00:09:31,884
What does that mean?

92
00:09:32,664 --> 00:09:35,082
Because I was hurt too deeply,

93
00:09:35,214 --> 00:09:40,879
I don't want to understand your dad, or forgive your dad.

94
00:09:44,222 --> 00:09:48,678
Dad isn't a bad man.

95
00:09:51,245 --> 00:09:55,784
He's just not a person who is able to guard himself.

96
00:09:56,434 --> 00:10:00,710
Gentleness and weakness does not matter.

97
00:10:01,154 --> 00:10:02,955
Let's go, Mom.

98
00:10:03,297 --> 00:10:06,394
I want to go home and rest.

99
00:10:24,781 --> 00:10:27,724
You've gotten skinnier, my child.

100
00:10:29,594 --> 00:10:32,814
Are you living in a dark corner?

101
00:10:33,646 --> 00:10:36,254
How my heart aches for you.

102
00:10:36,487 --> 00:10:37,986
What?

103
00:10:37,995 --> 00:10:42,448
In all of South Korea, only Mom feels sorry for me.

104
00:10:44,379 --> 00:10:48,987
Mom... Mom...

105
00:11:04,301 --> 00:11:05,802
Mom...

106
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:11,440
Mom...

107
00:11:19,549 --> 00:11:21,594
I want to live, Ji Sup.

108
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,843
I don't want to die.

109
00:11:25,948 --> 00:11:29,539
A month is okay. A week is fine.

110
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:32,693
Let me live a bit longer.

111
00:11:33,383 --> 00:11:37,007
Okay. You've got the right idea.

112
00:11:38,925 --> 00:11:43,724
Right now, the treatment at the hospital is also effective.

113
00:11:44,383 --> 00:11:49,188
If you stay at the hospital and accept
treatment it will be easier for you.

114
00:11:49,247 --> 00:11:53,642
So first, stay at the hospital.

115
00:11:53,814 --> 00:11:55,601
I understand.

116
00:11:55,755 --> 00:11:59,050
There are a lot of people in this hospital who recognize you.

117
00:11:59,156 --> 00:12:01,306
Nearby there is a newly-constructed hospital.

118
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:03,845
My friend is the director. His medical skills are very good.

119
00:12:03,938 --> 00:12:06,976
Please.

120
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,203
Kang Ae.

121
00:12:16,175 --> 00:12:21,397
I've seen patients who have gotten better on their own.

122
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:26,117
A person's health is uncertain.

123
00:12:26,522 --> 00:12:30,289
It's impossible to explain too clearly our modern-day technology.

124
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:34,252
Don't lose your courage.

125
00:12:36,194 --> 00:12:41,261
Also, although I've already told you this, but you need
to remember not to allow yourself too much stress.

126
00:12:41,317 --> 00:12:44,853
Stress is the worst thing to have right now.

127
00:12:54,763 --> 00:12:58,411
- Where's Da Mi?
- She just got a phone call and left.

128
00:13:21,304 --> 00:13:23,604
It's an interesting skill.

129
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:29,456
I have something I'd like to discuss with you.

130
00:13:29,573 --> 00:13:30,975
Go ahead.

131
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,895
Because my child's mother is getting remarried,

132
00:13:36,007 --> 00:13:39,474
I want to bring my child over here to study.

133
00:13:39,478 --> 00:13:43,158
Have you already agreed on it with the child's mother?

134
00:13:43,304 --> 00:13:44,551
Yes.

135
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:50,160
After you broke up, didn't you still pay child support?

136
00:13:50,283 --> 00:13:51,754
Yes.

137
00:13:52,383 --> 00:13:56,894
But a child that has already been raised
up is now going to be handed over to you?

138
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:00,987
It might be in consideration of the child's future.

139
00:14:01,065 --> 00:14:04,819
Even if I allowed it, would she come with you?

140
00:14:06,119 --> 00:14:09,987
Because of this issue, I want to go back one more time.

141
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:18,346
Give me some time to think about it.

142
00:14:18,372 --> 00:14:22,724
Seeing each other after twelve years,

143
00:14:23,211 --> 00:14:27,207
I like her.

144
00:14:44,239 --> 00:14:46,384
Sakae.

145
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:52,257
Can you forgive me one more time?

146
00:14:52,795 --> 00:14:55,220
Is it something concerning the other place?

147
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,115
About Miss Da Mi?

148
00:14:58,884 --> 00:15:03,866
I'd like to bring Da Mi over here to study.

149
00:15:05,247 --> 00:15:11,412
If it's something like that, please don't talk to me about it.

150
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:15,252
Don't make Yuka and Aki upset.

151
00:15:16,008 --> 00:15:18,066
Don't let anyone know.

152
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:22,009
Just take care of it quietly on your own.

153
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:26,580
If you have confidence, then do as you please.

154
00:15:35,774 --> 00:15:37,802
Sakae...

155
00:16:31,414 --> 00:16:34,779
Ahjumma, Da Mi is back.

156
00:16:45,785 --> 00:16:47,483
Where did you go?

157
00:16:47,529 --> 00:16:50,786
To the company. I have to go back again at noon.

158
00:16:51,003 --> 00:16:53,128
The company? Why?

159
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:56,896
I'm going to start working soon,
haven't I been on break for too long?

160
00:16:56,926 --> 00:16:58,934
Didn't you say it was over?

161
00:16:59,045 --> 00:17:02,167
Didn't you say you weren't going
to be an actress any longer?

162
00:17:02,203 --> 00:17:04,687
How did Mom know?

163
00:17:04,906 --> 00:17:07,215
I saw Chairman Ha's mother.

164
00:17:07,357 --> 00:17:08,639
Mother?

165
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:11,062
She came looking for me.

166
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:14,573
But why are you all of the sudden
saying you're going to work again?

167
00:17:15,113 --> 00:17:17,608
The company is running into some hard times.

168
00:17:17,657 --> 00:17:19,004
Da Mi.

169
00:17:19,198 --> 00:17:21,060
This is the last time.

170
00:17:21,245 --> 00:17:23,427
Afterwards I'll go to school.

171
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:26,123
Once you start, it'll be another few months.

172
00:17:26,131 --> 00:17:28,692
Mom can't wait that long.

173
00:17:28,991 --> 00:17:30,530
Why not?

174
00:17:33,109 --> 00:17:35,017
Just this once.

175
00:17:35,082 --> 00:17:37,138
I'll promise you, okay?

176
00:17:37,404 --> 00:17:40,488
Whatever you've gotten from that company,
you've already returned more than enough.

177
00:17:40,507 --> 00:17:42,724
There's no need to continue, Da Mi.

178
00:17:42,738 --> 00:17:44,749
Mom.

179
00:17:45,914 --> 00:17:47,942
Go to Japan.

180
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,744
You can't just stay here. You can't.

181
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,781
Go to Japan with your father.

182
00:17:56,689 --> 00:17:58,711
Go study.

183
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:01,269
Dad will take care of you.

184
00:18:01,298 --> 00:18:02,969
Why are you suddenly like this?

185
00:18:03,046 --> 00:18:09,075
I won't easily let you end up like this.
I'll make you go to school.

186
00:18:09,098 --> 00:18:11,621
Do you really want to send me away?

187
00:18:11,627 --> 00:18:13,340
Yes.

188
00:18:18,548 --> 00:18:20,520
<i>Don't waste any more time.</i>

189
00:18:20,521 --> 00:18:23,484
<i>Come and pick up the child.</i>

190
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,340
What does Da Mi think?

191
00:18:26,401 --> 00:18:29,167
She won't be that obedient.

192
00:18:30,327 --> 00:18:35,053
But in the end, she will understand.

193
00:18:37,353 --> 00:18:43,919
Don't let her think that she's being
kicked out because I'm getting married.

194
00:18:44,009 --> 00:18:47,679
I trust that you'll take good care of Da Mi.

195
00:18:48,535 --> 00:18:50,601
<i>Please.</i>

196
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:55,650
<i>Are you listening?</i>

197
00:18:57,632 --> 00:18:59,773
I'm listening.

198
00:19:01,663 --> 00:19:05,204
Hearing the word "Please" from you,

199
00:19:05,976 --> 00:19:08,415
My heart aches.

200
00:19:10,063 --> 00:19:12,521
Thank you for entrusting her to me.

201
00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:00,851
Are you ready?

202
00:20:03,219 --> 00:20:05,515
I've gotten the results of our hospital check-up.

203
00:20:05,594 --> 00:20:07,999
I didn't check up on anything useless.

204
00:20:08,438 --> 00:20:13,076
The liver, white blood cells, and bone marrow have all checked out fine.

205
00:20:13,218 --> 00:20:16,606
So tomorrow we will begin treatment.

206
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:21,116
I can be better, can't I?

207
00:20:21,312 --> 00:20:24,124
Think about when you and Da Mi's father broke up.

208
00:20:24,234 --> 00:20:28,313
At that time, Jeong Seon called me long distance.

209
00:20:28,486 --> 00:20:32,155
She told me to pick you up when you came back to the country.

210
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:36,657
She said she was very worried about you.

211
00:20:39,096 --> 00:20:44,562
When I saw you in the airport, my heart ached.

212
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,423
Didn't you make it through all of that?

213
00:20:53,532 --> 00:20:57,345
The Lee Kang Ae that I know isn't a weak person.

214
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:05,328
That's true. You're right. I'll get through it.

215
00:21:07,923 --> 00:21:12,243
In the next five days, everyday you'll have to get three types of shots.

216
00:21:12,515 --> 00:21:14,638
When you get them, it might hurt a lot.

217
00:21:14,693 --> 00:21:18,883
A week after they're done, it'll be a lot better.

218
00:21:21,181 --> 00:21:26,836
Because the medicinal properties are too strong,
every day the shot will be in the same place.

219
00:21:26,947 --> 00:21:29,741
Even so, you have to endure it.

220
00:21:34,456 --> 00:21:35,186
Oppa.

221
00:21:36,969 --> 00:21:38,303
That's right.

222
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:42,353
Don't you believe me?

223
00:21:42,475 --> 00:21:44,421
Hear me out!

224
00:21:45,242 --> 00:21:46,805
Why do you only think of yourself?

225
00:21:46,897 --> 00:21:49,849
It's really hard to understand!

226
00:21:53,464 --> 00:21:55,219
She's still not back?

227
00:21:56,052 --> 00:21:58,602
Go warm up the house.

228
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,337
Good, you've done well.

229
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:07,271
Oh, at the airport.

230
00:22:07,531 --> 00:22:08,714
Da Mi, you've worked hard!

231
00:22:08,751 --> 00:22:11,275
- Yes, you've worked hard!
- You've worked hard, see you tomorrow!

232
00:22:16,284 --> 00:22:17,900
Yoo Da Mi ssi.

233
00:22:20,353 --> 00:22:21,416
Yes?

234
00:22:25,156 --> 00:22:27,081
Appearing now is good.

235
00:22:27,952 --> 00:22:30,296
Our company raised you.

236
00:22:30,952 --> 00:22:33,950
Don't think of having a change of heart.
In the future, you should concentrate...

237
00:22:33,954 --> 00:22:37,146
And hand over the position...

238
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:38,847
as Chairman, right, Mother?

239
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:43,202
That's the way it should be!

240
00:22:43,347 --> 00:22:45,033
Let's talk about it when we get home.

241
00:22:45,043 --> 00:22:46,547
Please just don't interfere anymore.

242
00:22:46,686 --> 00:22:48,550
Up until now, hasn't Hyung done a great job?

243
00:22:48,655 --> 00:22:50,440
You stubborn rascal, what do you know?

244
00:22:50,551 --> 00:22:52,750
Just because of your brother, the company almost collapsed!

245
00:22:52,894 --> 00:22:55,537
Can you promise that in the future something like this won't happen?

246
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:56,798
Mom.

247
00:22:57,319 --> 00:22:59,920
My being like this is all for you!

248
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,234
Don't you know?

249
00:23:01,236 --> 00:23:04,145
Throw aside all of that useless greed!

250
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:08,898
I'm really ashamed of Mom.

251
00:23:08,917 --> 00:23:10,253
What is there to be ashamed about?

252
00:23:10,269 --> 00:23:13,390
Have I gambled or have I stolen someone else's money?

253
00:23:13,484 --> 00:23:15,165
Don't say anymore. Hurry on home.

254
00:23:15,188 --> 00:23:15,872
Hurry and go.

255
00:23:17,165 --> 00:23:18,731
This child…

256
00:23:20,658 --> 00:23:21,730
Hyung.

257
00:23:23,546 --> 00:23:25,404
I'll take him home.

258
00:23:25,889 --> 00:23:27,569
You go ahead.

259
00:23:28,018 --> 00:23:31,126
Don't let him drink, have him home early.

260
00:23:32,975 --> 00:23:35,887
Aigoo, you stubborn rascal.

261
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:48,548
Let's go. Let's go eat.

262
00:24:03,062 --> 00:24:04,731
I understand your feelings.

263
00:24:06,201 --> 00:24:08,980
I understand your feelings toward me.

264
00:24:09,506 --> 00:24:10,625
It's okay.

265
00:24:10,883 --> 00:24:15,901
The first time I saw you, it was when you were seven, right?

266
00:24:17,645 --> 00:24:20,436
Then, I was in my first year of middle school.

267
00:24:20,697 --> 00:24:25,501
Before you appeared I always felt so tired.

268
00:24:27,357 --> 00:24:29,939
My father was busy all of the time,

269
00:24:30,121 --> 00:24:33,528
My mother was sick all the time.

270
00:24:34,484 --> 00:24:36,810
Because I always ate alone,

271
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,245
I felt very lonely.

272
00:24:42,432 --> 00:24:43,386
Hyung.

273
00:24:44,246 --> 00:24:51,091
When Mom ridicules me, do you think
I always just endure it patiently?

274
00:24:52,835 --> 00:24:56,854
It's hard to always be patient.

275
00:24:58,164 --> 00:25:04,794
But when I remember that I have only one
younger brother, I wouldn't feel bad anymore.

276
00:25:04,924 --> 00:25:07,546
I can endure it.

277
00:25:17,135 --> 00:25:22,948
Mom, aunt, uncle and the others, they always tell me,

278
00:25:23,103 --> 00:25:27,338
that I'm a guy who wouldn't bleed a
drop even when pierced by a needle.

279
00:25:28,017 --> 00:25:31,141
That might actually be true.

280
00:25:32,018 --> 00:25:41,027
But when I saw my brother hurting, I would hurt too.

281
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:26,036
Oppa.

282
00:26:31,848 --> 00:26:33,898
Come inside.

283
00:26:36,146 --> 00:26:40,621
If you're like this, then the Chairman will feel even worse.

284
00:26:47,371 --> 00:26:49,442
Oppa.

285
00:26:54,598 --> 00:26:56,633
Traveling?

286
00:26:57,069 --> 00:27:01,541
Hey Da Mi, did you know that Mom went traveling?

287
00:27:02,102 --> 00:27:04,092
Earlier this morning, she didn't say anything.

288
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:06,247
She must've wanted to go all of a sudden.

289
00:27:06,264 --> 00:27:09,386
Well anyway, artists are always like that.

290
00:27:09,698 --> 00:27:11,572
Then I won't say anything, Da Mi.

291
00:27:11,929 --> 00:27:13,889
Sin Ae has set a date.

292
00:27:13,937 --> 00:27:15,878
Omo, really?

293
00:27:15,955 --> 00:27:19,229
Yeah, she said she's going to marry him
no matter what. What else could be done?

294
00:27:19,405 --> 00:27:20,931
Congratulations, ahjumma.

295
00:27:21,281 --> 00:27:23,826
I don't know if I was right or wrong.

296
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:27,812
After that stubborn girl heard it, she ran out of the
house so happy like a little dog. She's still not back either.

297
00:27:27,834 --> 00:27:31,328
Then when is my mother getting married?

298
00:27:31,777 --> 00:27:32,984
Yeah.

299
00:27:33,125 --> 00:27:36,190
- I heard that they've already started building the house.
- The house?

300
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:42,203
Ajussi says that he's going to build a
beautiful house and bring your mom over there.

301
00:27:42,313 --> 00:27:44,315
- You go too!
- What?

302
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:45,921
Get married!

303
00:27:47,106 --> 00:27:50,679
- You get so happy just at the mention of marriage.
- Oh, that's not it, Ahjumma.

304
00:27:50,779 --> 00:27:53,223
What? You're even blushing!

305
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,900
What are you talking about, Ahjumma?

306
00:27:54,902 --> 00:27:56,188
Look, look!

307
00:27:56,511 --> 00:27:58,624
Aigoo, aigoo!

308
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:05,570
<i>My beloved Da Mi,</i>

309
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:10,907
<i>Mom has begun to accept treatment.</i>

310
00:28:17,941 --> 00:28:19,113
Yes?

311
00:28:22,845 --> 00:28:24,101
Are you sleeping well?

312
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,334
Yes.

313
00:28:26,842 --> 00:28:28,184
Are you going to work?

314
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:32,339
Yes. I'll stay ten minutes here and then go.

315
00:28:32,827 --> 00:28:34,105
Don't worry about it.

316
00:28:34,608 --> 00:28:36,198
I'm not worrying.

317
00:28:36,404 --> 00:28:37,606
Is your mood a bit better?

318
00:28:37,885 --> 00:28:39,154
Mmhmm.

319
00:28:40,965 --> 00:28:43,198
Think about it, Ji Sup.

320
00:28:43,826 --> 00:28:48,732
I don't think that my life isn't good.

321
00:28:48,998 --> 00:28:51,918
Aren't there many people who, though
they have the ability and the strength,

322
00:28:52,013 --> 00:28:55,855
have never experienced success even once?

323
00:28:56,421 --> 00:29:02,849
Whenever one of my pieces is a success,
I'll feel both guilty and thankful.

324
00:29:03,499 --> 00:29:05,563
I'll be fine.

325
00:29:06,326 --> 00:29:08,577
Yes, that's the way to think.

326
00:29:08,808 --> 00:29:12,014
Coming from Ma Pu to here isn't a complete waste.

327
00:29:12,258 --> 00:29:15,934
It was all because of your hard work and luck.

328
00:29:16,648 --> 00:29:19,356
You aren't a weak person either.

329
00:29:20,115 --> 00:29:22,247
Try with all your effort.

330
00:29:25,379 --> 00:29:28,478
A medical professor in New York wrote a book..

331
00:29:28,639 --> 00:29:33,499
Your sickness can be healed based on your personal mood and feelings.

332
00:29:34,322 --> 00:29:37,620
The patient's attitude and mood is very important.

333
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:42,728
You have to keep believing that you'll get better, believe that you'll be healed.

334
00:29:43,046 --> 00:29:44,636
I will.

335
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,050
I've seen Keon Hee Hyung.

336
00:29:52,297 --> 00:29:53,840
He seems to be working very hard.

337
00:29:54,327 --> 00:29:59,151
I was thinking about whether or not to tell him the truth.

338
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:01,697
If we tell him the truth...

339
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:07,407
It'll be even harder for him.

340
00:30:10,646 --> 00:30:12,721
I know too...

341
00:30:12,922 --> 00:30:16,393
That he is a compassionate kind-hearted man.

342
00:30:16,796 --> 00:30:21,471
He won't just let me alone.

343
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:25,886
But there's no way to keep on until the end.

344
00:30:27,535 --> 00:30:31,463
I don't want to let him know that I might be dying from sickness.

345
00:30:31,877 --> 00:30:36,330
I don't want to get his comfort before I die either.

346
00:30:36,603 --> 00:30:40,704
I only want to let him remember when I was good.

347
00:30:41,721 --> 00:30:42,722
Kang Ae.

348
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:49,477
I don't know what my Da Mi is doing.

349
00:30:50,184 --> 00:30:54,026
Since there's also a branch of the company here, I'll come often.

350
00:30:56,121 --> 00:30:58,903
Did you come here because Mom asked you to?

351
00:30:58,932 --> 00:31:00,271
You already know?

352
00:31:00,486 --> 00:31:03,557
If that's the reason then your trip was a waste.

353
00:31:11,774 --> 00:31:14,105
Although Mom brought it up first,

354
00:31:14,808 --> 00:31:19,775
I don't think that Mom asked as a favor.

355
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:23,315
I think that this is Mom's consent.

356
00:31:24,973 --> 00:31:28,905
I know you resent me.

357
00:31:31,871 --> 00:31:37,094
I need time to be with you.

358
00:31:40,262 --> 00:31:42,671
How about Yuka?

359
00:31:42,678 --> 00:31:44,371
Is she doing well?

360
00:31:55,008 --> 00:31:57,305
It's a letter from Yuka.

361
00:32:09,491 --> 00:32:11,097
<i>Dear Da Mi Unni,</i>

362
00:32:11,615 --> 00:32:15,837
<i>Right now Yuka is very studiously learning Korean,</i>

363
00:32:16,124 --> 00:32:20,745
<i>Next time when I see Unni, I will loudly shout</i>

364
00:32:21,183 --> 00:32:23,197
<i>"Da Mi Unni!"</i>

365
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:28,121
<i>At that time, please embrace Yuka in your heart.</i>

366
00:32:28,635 --> 00:32:33,260
<i>During this time I didn't know the truth, I'm sorry.</i>

367
00:32:33,543 --> 00:32:35,899
<i>See you next time!</i>

368
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:37,687
<i>Yuka.</i>

369
00:32:47,728 --> 00:32:49,575
Did Dad tell her?

370
00:32:59,819 --> 00:33:01,442
No.

371
00:33:01,894 --> 00:33:03,997
Yuka found out on her own.

372
00:33:13,197 --> 00:33:17,322
Is Dad always a person to be carried away by circumstances?

373
00:33:17,642 --> 00:33:21,982
Because of Grandpa, because of Mom, because of Yuka.

374
00:33:24,251 --> 00:33:27,557
What type of person is Dad, really?

375
00:33:29,886 --> 00:33:32,918
I love you, Da Mi.

376
00:33:34,372 --> 00:33:37,045
I will resolve my own problems.

377
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:43,346
Are you going back to the film set?

378
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,933
I have an appointment to meet someone.

379
00:33:45,995 --> 00:33:47,759
Let's go, Dad will take you.

380
00:33:48,201 --> 00:33:50,267
It's close by.

381
00:33:53,373 --> 00:33:55,708
It's really cold, hurry back.

382
00:34:45,622 --> 00:34:48,510
It's okay, it's okay.

383
00:34:49,798 --> 00:34:53,855
It'll be okay. It'll be okay.

384
00:35:20,661 --> 00:35:22,751
I heard that you threw up, didn't you?

385
00:35:23,155 --> 00:35:23,898
Yes.

386
00:35:25,044 --> 00:35:27,414
Try taking it again after you have calmed down.

387
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:29,436
If that still doesn't work, we'll change the medication.

388
00:35:29,673 --> 00:35:31,642
Do you have any other symptoms?

389
00:35:33,399 --> 00:35:39,030
My mouth is dry, and it's a bit hard to breathe.

390
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:43,502
When will radiation begin?

391
00:35:44,424 --> 00:35:46,079
It has to follow a sequence.

392
00:35:46,641 --> 00:35:48,581
Did the results of the blood tests come out yet?

393
00:35:48,718 --> 00:35:49,925
Not yet.

394
00:35:50,679 --> 00:35:54,064
We will decide after the results come out.

395
00:35:54,499 --> 00:35:55,707
Well then…

396
00:36:00,133 --> 00:36:02,751
Lee Kang Ae ssi, here is your medicine.

397
00:36:25,479 --> 00:36:26,610
Hello?

398
00:36:28,118 --> 00:36:29,332
<i>Mom?</i>

399
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:33,890
<i>Hello?</i>

400
00:36:35,534 --> 00:36:37,101
Yes, it's Mom.

401
00:36:37,425 --> 00:36:39,069
<i>Where are you, Mom?</i>

402
00:36:40,274 --> 00:36:41,898
Oh, by the ocean.

403
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:43,889
<i>How wonderful!</i>

404
00:36:43,958 --> 00:36:45,634
<i>What did you do today?</i>

405
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:52,073
I watched the sea, and ate yummy stuff.

406
00:36:53,726 --> 00:36:55,682
I slept a long time.

407
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:57,662
And also walked around a lot.

408
00:36:58,385 --> 00:37:00,464
<i>Can you see the ocean from your room?</i>

409
00:37:02,277 --> 00:37:05,274
Oh, yeah, I can see it.

410
00:37:05,533 --> 00:37:08,713
<i>Mom, rest comfortably there for a while. You don't have to worry about me.</i>

411
00:37:08,723 --> 00:37:12,430
<i>And also, I had lunch with Dad today.</i>

412
00:37:13,737 --> 00:37:14,922
Really?

413
00:37:17,614 --> 00:37:19,248
What did Dad say?

414
00:37:22,192 --> 00:37:26,606
Mom, Yeo Jin is at our house right now.
Let's talk about it next time.

415
00:37:26,608 --> 00:37:28,220
<i>Okay, I got it.</i>

416
00:37:28,236 --> 00:37:29,595
<i>Be happy.</i>

417
00:37:30,788 --> 00:37:32,809
You too, Mom.

418
00:37:35,563 --> 00:37:37,603
Did you hang up so quickly because of me?

419
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,434
Talk some more.

420
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:43,574
Hmm, what is Sin Beom Oppa doing?

421
00:37:45,708 --> 00:37:47,112
If you're curious then go see.

422
00:37:48,644 --> 00:37:50,019
Where are you going?

423
00:37:50,321 --> 00:37:51,859
To wash up.

424
00:37:52,408 --> 00:37:53,706
Yeo Jin.

425
00:37:54,082 --> 00:37:56,691
I'm going to do that commercial that I mentioned last time.

426
00:37:57,581 --> 00:37:59,300
Didn't you say you weren't doing that?

427
00:37:59,365 --> 00:38:01,080
I want to earn money.

428
00:38:53,219 --> 00:38:56,973
Why'd you take away even the IV tube?

429
00:38:57,391 --> 00:38:59,781
Just now they even took off the IV tube.

430
00:39:02,063 --> 00:39:03,345
Kang Ae.

431
00:39:04,712 --> 00:39:06,895
What? I'm fine.

432
00:39:07,331 --> 00:39:08,784
I can take it.

433
00:39:11,185 --> 00:39:13,783
The results of the blood test indicate

434
00:39:14,655 --> 00:39:18,764
that the level of the white blood cells have greatly decreased.

435
00:39:22,967 --> 00:39:28,643
You can't continue to accept treatment.

436
00:39:32,082 --> 00:39:37,288
Having less white blood cells means a weak immune system.

437
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:41,358
The immunity towards terminal illnesses is also weaker.

438
00:39:42,501 --> 00:39:44,389
So we have to stop.

439
00:39:47,285 --> 00:39:54,204
Then, if it goes back to normal, will I continue accepting treatment?

440
00:39:56,452 --> 00:39:58,243
We'll see.

441
00:40:16,001 --> 00:40:21,045
Give me some hot water.

442
00:40:22,438 --> 00:40:23,683
Okay.

443
00:41:27,513 --> 00:41:29,724
Besides hospital treatment, there are still many other ways.

444
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:31,950
Don't give up here.

445
00:41:33,347 --> 00:41:35,270
Then tell everyone, okay?

446
00:41:35,725 --> 00:41:38,695
Tell Jeong Seon, tell Da Mi, tell everyone.

447
00:41:39,301 --> 00:41:41,332
Then accept help.

448
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:44,538
Eat whatever is said to help.

449
00:41:44,962 --> 00:41:47,471
If there are any good methods then look for them.

450
00:41:47,643 --> 00:41:48,707
That's why...

451
00:41:48,707 --> 00:41:51,736
That's why I said there were people who got better.

452
00:41:53,957 --> 00:41:55,612
Why aren't you saying anything?

453
00:41:55,705 --> 00:41:58,956
Taking it by yourself, not letting anyone else know.

454
00:41:59,284 --> 00:42:01,253
What type of arrogance is this?

455
00:42:02,296 --> 00:42:05,957
It was hell when I first found out about it.

456
00:42:07,621 --> 00:42:10,330
Even like that, will my sickness get better?

457
00:42:10,369 --> 00:42:13,184
Why should I let everyone be upset in advance?

458
00:42:13,212 --> 00:42:15,237
Sickness also gets better.

459
00:42:15,881 --> 00:42:17,531
Say it.

460
00:42:18,732 --> 00:42:20,601
Who knows what type of method will come out from where?

461
00:42:20,633 --> 00:42:22,649
Ji Sup, please.

462
00:42:29,021 --> 00:42:32,383
Weren't you the same way with Ji Na's mother?

463
00:42:33,068 --> 00:42:36,643
Everything that could've been tried was tried.

464
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:44,503
So, aren't you regretful?

465
00:42:48,456 --> 00:42:51,676
There's obviously nothing left that we can do.

466
00:42:51,714 --> 00:42:55,892
But is it good to still waste all the time that's left?

467
00:42:56,904 --> 00:42:58,993
So?

468
00:42:59,005 --> 00:43:02,100
Does Ji Na like you?

469
00:43:05,601 --> 00:43:07,923
How is Ji Na's mother now?

470
00:43:08,489 --> 00:43:11,876
Did she want to leave by that method?

471
00:43:16,208 --> 00:43:17,291
No.

472
00:43:20,474 --> 00:43:21,522
No.

473
00:43:24,108 --> 00:43:26,632
She only told me afterwards,

474
00:43:30,905 --> 00:43:35,268
to let her go.

475
00:43:43,967 --> 00:43:46,002
What could I have done?

476
00:43:47,923 --> 00:43:50,029
I still don't know.

477
00:43:52,912 --> 00:43:55,037
Because I'm a doctor,

478
00:43:55,454 --> 00:44:02,504
compared to other people, I didn't give up on Ji Na's mother that early.

479
00:44:04,891 --> 00:44:11,614
That woman was in pain longer than others.

480
00:44:20,955 --> 00:44:27,834
Let me decide how to leave.

481
00:44:29,128 --> 00:44:36,689
- Kang Ae.
- I want to live like a normal person in the time I have left.

482
00:44:37,589 --> 00:44:44,114
Knowing I don't have long to live... Seeing the people
I love worry and not able to breathe because of me...

483
00:44:45,521 --> 00:44:48,239
I don't want it to be like that, Ji Sup.

484
00:44:57,886 --> 00:45:00,399
This precious time,

485
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:06,137
I will use it well.

486
00:48:48,203 --> 00:48:49,205
Da Mi ssi.

487
00:48:49,222 --> 00:48:50,534
- Da Mi ssi.
- Yes.

488
00:48:51,991 --> 00:48:53,957
This is from the Chairman.

489
00:48:54,834 --> 00:48:57,961
I was the one who said that your cell phone was broken.

490
00:48:58,619 --> 00:49:00,370
I'll just buy it myself.

491
00:49:00,488 --> 00:49:05,066
He says that if his younger brother calls, then get in touch with him.

492
00:49:05,659 --> 00:49:06,424
What?

493
00:49:07,909 --> 00:49:09,991
They say he's disappeared.

494
00:49:58,563 --> 00:50:00,500
Why'd you come back without contacting us?

495
00:50:00,514 --> 00:50:02,258
Oh, I just got back.

496
00:50:02,316 --> 00:50:05,370
What? If you'd told me I would've gone to pick you up.

497
00:50:06,224 --> 00:50:07,740
You don't look well.

498
00:50:07,852 --> 00:50:08,963
Are you sick?

499
00:50:09,432 --> 00:50:12,664
Yes, it must've been something I ate.

500
00:50:13,004 --> 00:50:14,851
What did you eat?

501
00:50:14,976 --> 00:50:18,099
In a matter of days, your complexion has completely changed.

502
00:50:18,134 --> 00:50:22,224
Why act so carelessly? It's affecting even your stomach.

503
00:50:23,943 --> 00:50:25,038
Are you alone?

504
00:50:25,336 --> 00:50:28,755
Yes. Having not been able to get in
touch with you, I've almost gone crazy.

505
00:50:28,864 --> 00:50:30,349
Sin Ae has set a date.

506
00:50:31,072 --> 00:50:32,163
Really?

507
00:50:32,551 --> 00:50:34,607
That's good.

508
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:44,517
Hey, he wanted the mother-in-law to be healthy,
so he bought a dumbbell. What do you think?

509
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:46,344
Really?

510
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:52,467
After he brought it here, he said... Mom, do this. Mom, do that.

511
00:50:52,476 --> 00:50:55,826
After a while, he drilled a hole and hung it up.

512
00:50:58,013 --> 00:51:01,003
Don't laugh, my heart's rather miserable.

513
00:51:02,265 --> 00:51:04,534
Did you go traveling together?

514
00:51:06,650 --> 00:51:09,075
Stubborn girl, I knew it.

515
00:51:10,766 --> 00:51:12,075
Were you happy?

516
00:51:12,584 --> 00:51:14,382
Was he good to you?

517
00:51:15,552 --> 00:51:17,113
Jeong Seon,

518
00:51:18,327 --> 00:51:23,049
I want to eat that Sesame Porridge of yours.

519
00:51:23,295 --> 00:51:27,092
Now I've seen everything!

520
00:51:27,201 --> 00:51:29,231
You've even asked me to make something for you!

521
00:51:29,326 --> 00:51:31,937
Aren't you really good at making porridge?

522
00:51:32,207 --> 00:51:37,238
When my stomach's not feeling well, you have no idea how good it feels to eat that.

523
00:51:37,524 --> 00:51:39,095
Silly girl.

524
00:51:39,515 --> 00:51:42,344
I am rather good at making porridge.

525
00:51:42,998 --> 00:51:44,295
Just porridge?

526
00:51:44,636 --> 00:51:48,020
Your meat and ginger soup is also
really good. Your kimchi is also good.

527
00:51:50,214 --> 00:51:52,671
It's really nice when you're by my side.

528
00:51:53,082 --> 00:51:58,280
If it weren't for you, it'd be really hard for me.

529
00:51:59,882 --> 00:52:02,234
You're about to get married and you really say the strangest things.

530
00:52:02,277 --> 00:52:07,183
Don't say anything, you've gotten my heart all warm and tickled.

531
00:52:10,497 --> 00:52:12,682
Thank you, friend.

532
00:52:13,033 --> 00:52:14,923
Aigoo, really.

533
00:52:16,151 --> 00:52:19,266
Wait a sec, I'll soak the rice.

534
00:52:41,303 --> 00:52:42,936
I'm back!

535
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:46,495
You're back?

536
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:50,150
Mom!

537
00:52:50,370 --> 00:52:53,547
Come on in. I made kimchi fried rice.

538
00:53:01,506 --> 00:53:03,132
When did you get back?

539
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:04,511
Earlier in the morning.

540
00:53:05,031 --> 00:53:06,481
Was it fun?

541
00:53:06,505 --> 00:53:11,371
Yes. But since I was so anxious to get back I didn't buy anything.

542
00:53:11,673 --> 00:53:13,057
It's okay.

543
00:53:14,152 --> 00:53:16,230
Did Mom make the kimchi fried rice?

544
00:53:16,404 --> 00:53:18,293
I only helped out a bit.

545
00:53:18,322 --> 00:53:20,515
She ate something on her trip and it got her sick.

546
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:23,514
So that's why you don't look well.

547
00:53:24,504 --> 00:53:25,776
Eat well.

548
00:53:26,514 --> 00:53:27,870
It must be very good!

549
00:53:35,522 --> 00:53:37,527
Eat slower.

550
00:53:48,647 --> 00:53:51,501
Mom must really like taking walks.

551
00:53:52,332 --> 00:53:53,797
Did Dad say that?

552
00:53:54,003 --> 00:53:55,003
Mm-hmm.

553
00:53:55,908 --> 00:53:59,725
Dad said that as soon as you finished dinner you'd drag him out for a walk.

554
00:54:00,753 --> 00:54:06,645
I seem to still remember taking a walk before with Mom and Dad.

555
00:54:08,805 --> 00:54:13,926
On the walk, didn't we always have to go into the stationery store?

556
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:18,236
To go look at the erasers and the pencils.

557
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:20,221
Really?

558
00:54:20,878 --> 00:54:23,814
Every time a new eraser came out we'd have to buy it.

559
00:54:23,817 --> 00:54:26,486
Aigoo, back then we really bought a lot.

560
00:54:28,774 --> 00:54:31,191
We liked to look at flowers.

561
00:54:31,645 --> 00:54:37,250
We'd stand in front of the flower store and stare a long time.

562
00:54:39,313 --> 00:54:45,375
How many more times will I be able to take walks with Mom like this?

563
00:54:49,025 --> 00:54:51,206
Didn't you say you were getting married?

564
00:54:52,484 --> 00:54:53,959
I still don't know when we'll get married.

565
00:54:54,014 --> 00:54:56,600
But why are you so eager to send me over to Dad's?

566
00:54:56,644 --> 00:54:59,080
It's not because of this.

567
00:54:59,716 --> 00:55:01,222
Mom.

568
00:55:03,773 --> 00:55:06,375
Because of that, it's been very hard for me.

569
00:55:06,499 --> 00:55:08,500
I'm like a burden.

570
00:55:08,594 --> 00:55:09,834
Da Mi.

571
00:55:10,314 --> 00:55:15,250
I know, I'm not doing it to make you feel bad.

572
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:18,749
But it's still rather strange.

573
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:24,219
Mom is Mom, Dad is Dad.
Both say that they love me.

574
00:55:24,662 --> 00:55:27,298
And I know that neither is lying.

575
00:55:28,677 --> 00:55:33,235
But why isn't there anything that can enter my heart?

576
00:55:34,124 --> 00:55:36,877
Why do I always feel like I'm alone?

577
00:55:41,546 --> 00:55:44,085
It looks like I really haven't matured after all.

578
00:55:46,511 --> 00:55:48,024
It's not like that.

579
00:55:49,996 --> 00:55:53,303
I'm sorry, for making you feel this way.

580
00:55:53,328 --> 00:55:55,526
It's okay.

581
00:55:57,967 --> 00:56:00,271
I want to tell you something, Mom.

582
00:56:00,387 --> 00:56:02,272
I rented a house.

583
00:56:02,666 --> 00:56:03,708
Hmm?

584
00:56:03,855 --> 00:56:05,763
It's near the company.

585
00:56:06,583 --> 00:56:08,537
I found a small apartment.

586
00:56:08,634 --> 00:56:10,833
I'll be moving in the day after next.

587
00:56:10,959 --> 00:56:12,225
Da Mi.

588
00:56:12,457 --> 00:56:14,981
Well, after Mom gets married,

589
00:56:15,115 --> 00:56:17,287
it'll be me living in that house by myself anyway.

590
00:56:18,885 --> 00:56:22,759
So if I went along to the new house it'd be hard for me to get used to.

591
00:56:23,708 --> 00:56:25,791
Don't worry about me.

592
00:56:26,151 --> 00:56:28,679
Mom, just do as you please.

593
00:56:29,051 --> 00:56:31,864
I can live on my own now.

594
00:56:33,824 --> 00:56:36,021
You're not going with Dad?

595
00:56:36,562 --> 00:56:39,573
I'll give myself some time to consider it.

596
00:56:40,836 --> 00:56:43,239
Even if I went to Japan,

597
00:56:47,238 --> 00:56:50,398
Then will I not have a house here anymore?

598
00:56:51,853 --> 00:56:55,614
If you live by yourself there, will you think it is too big?

599
00:56:55,866 --> 00:56:56,959
Mmhmm.

600
00:56:58,150 --> 00:57:00,273
Then Mom will buy a house for you.

601
00:57:00,387 --> 00:57:02,479
Just move in directly.

602
00:57:04,801 --> 00:57:06,567
But not now.

603
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:09,230
Go later.

604
00:57:09,435 --> 00:57:10,457
Huh?

605
00:57:11,552 --> 00:57:16,863
Let me take Grandma's stuff.

606
00:57:22,453 --> 00:57:25,332
Don't take Grandma's stuff away.

607
00:57:25,999 --> 00:57:27,087
Why not?

608
00:57:36,699 --> 00:57:38,905
Da Mi, isn't there a phrase like this?

609
00:57:40,688 --> 00:57:45,868
"You must also learn to let the ones you love go."

610
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:55,573
No matter who it is, there will be a time for him or her to leave.

611
00:57:57,403 --> 00:58:02,087
Let her go, forget her.

612
00:58:03,981 --> 00:58:06,216
This is also love.

613
00:58:09,024 --> 00:58:13,322
Mom hasn't done it.

614
00:58:14,967 --> 00:58:17,322
It's really very hard.

615
00:58:21,334 --> 00:58:24,752
In the eight years that I knew your father,

616
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:28,922
I was very happy, Da Mi.

617
00:58:29,853 --> 00:58:36,033
But, when I should've let him go, I didn't.

618
00:58:37,969 --> 00:58:42,033
I lived with Dad forever in my heart.

619
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:53,247
Because of this, I missed out on many precious things.

620
00:59:05,184 --> 00:59:07,147
Don't be like this.

621
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:11,400
You've loved Dad, haven't you?

622
00:59:15,822 --> 00:59:17,022
Yes.

623
00:59:19,635 --> 00:59:22,792
I loved him more than anyone else in the world.

624
00:59:24,947 --> 00:59:27,057
He's a good man.

625
00:59:33,596 --> 00:59:37,041
Let me see how beautiful my daughter is.

626
01:00:02,238 --> 01:00:05,250
When you make something, do it directly.

627
01:00:05,369 --> 01:00:07,933
When you watch, watch it directly.

628
01:00:08,031 --> 01:00:10,042
My thoughts are right, aren't they?

629
01:00:10,474 --> 01:00:11,454
Yeah.

630
01:00:11,938 --> 01:00:14,943
Their parents will want to see how we live, won't they?

631
01:00:14,988 --> 01:00:16,339
You've done well.

632
01:00:17,068 --> 01:00:21,119
You're doing well too. It should've been this way a lot earlier.

633
01:00:40,437 --> 01:00:42,044
Cut, okay!

634
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:43,726
Good work!

635
01:00:43,836 --> 01:00:44,979
Good work!

636
01:00:45,274 --> 01:00:46,132
Good work!

637
01:00:46,775 --> 01:00:48,463
- Good work!
- Good work!

638
01:00:48,650 --> 01:00:50,185
- Good work!
- Good work!

639
01:00:50,515 --> 01:00:52,179
- Good work!
- Good work!

640
01:00:52,312 --> 01:00:54,324
Good work!

641
01:00:54,618 --> 01:00:56,386
Good work!

642
01:01:12,725 --> 01:01:14,814
Is there a reason why you're here for me?

643
01:01:14,830 --> 01:01:17,020
I want to go back together.

644
01:01:18,346 --> 01:01:20,989
Mom invited me to eat dinner together.

645
01:01:21,021 --> 01:01:22,285
Mom?

646
01:01:22,763 --> 01:01:23,843
Yes.

647
01:02:08,571 --> 01:02:10,072
You came.

648
01:02:10,889 --> 01:02:12,769
Thank you for your invitation.

649
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:15,639
Bring him in.

650
01:02:22,872 --> 01:02:26,691
Wow! Mom is really a great chef!

651
01:02:27,430 --> 01:02:29,641
When it's a special occasion, she'll like to invite others.

652
01:02:29,723 --> 01:02:32,250
Mom also really likes to use candles.

653
01:02:33,268 --> 01:02:34,565
Sit.

654
01:02:35,768 --> 01:02:37,175
I'm going to wash my hands.

655
01:02:37,188 --> 01:02:38,079
Dad.

656
01:02:38,406 --> 01:02:39,267
Mmm.

657
01:02:45,642 --> 01:02:48,017
You seem to be a lot thinner.

658
01:02:48,537 --> 01:02:50,181
I'm not feeling too well.

659
01:02:50,488 --> 01:02:51,663
Where?

660
01:02:52,845 --> 01:02:54,674
It was something I ate.

661
01:02:56,203 --> 01:02:59,141
You have to be careful of your health. Don't get sick.

662
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:02,965
You have gout...

663
01:03:02,979 --> 01:03:07,048
I'm fine. It hasn't started up for a long time now.

664
01:03:07,049 --> 01:03:08,937
Don't get sick anymore.

665
01:03:09,165 --> 01:03:17,415
When the time comes for Da Mi to get married, you have
to be healthy and well in order to walk her down the aisle.

666
01:03:18,876 --> 01:03:21,100
Will you allow me to?

667
01:03:21,267 --> 01:03:24,502
Is she called Yuka?

668
01:03:27,796 --> 01:03:30,174
Da Mi told me.

669
01:03:30,860 --> 01:03:32,427
And also...

670
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:35,008
Aki.

671
01:03:37,327 --> 01:03:39,601
Does he look like you?

672
01:03:42,038 --> 01:03:43,505
Aki does.

673
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:48,380
I want to meet them.

674
01:03:52,796 --> 01:03:57,642
The way you were before, that
image still appears in front of me.

675
01:03:59,530 --> 01:04:01,992
Often with smiling people.

676
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:06,344
People smiling often.

677
01:04:15,286 --> 01:04:16,790
Oh, yes.

678
01:04:17,274 --> 01:04:20,397
I left the red wine in the car.
Don't you like red wine a lot?

679
01:04:21,241 --> 01:04:23,146
Didn't I get it from you?

680
01:04:23,709 --> 01:04:27,687
I learned a lot about red wine.

681
01:04:27,931 --> 01:04:28,993
Kang Ae.

682
01:04:29,585 --> 01:04:31,456
Bring the red wine in.

683
01:04:31,457 --> 01:04:34,084
We'll make a toast to Da Mi.

684
01:04:34,995 --> 01:04:39,125
Teach Da Mi about red wine too. Start from the basics.

685
01:04:39,162 --> 01:04:41,168
Slowly.

686
01:04:44,859 --> 01:04:47,226
Dad is going out to get something from the car.

687
01:04:50,847 --> 01:04:55,725
Mom will just take some medicine and come back.

688
01:04:57,401 --> 01:05:00,130
Did Mom make this bouquet?

689
01:05:32,662 --> 01:05:33,756
Wife!

690
01:05:33,776 --> 01:05:34,717
Kang Ae!

691
01:05:35,590 --> 01:05:36,588
Kang Ae!

692
01:05:36,663 --> 01:05:38,180
Pull yourself together!

693
01:05:38,229 --> 01:05:39,549
Kang Ae, what's wrong?

694
01:05:39,566 --> 01:05:40,500
Pull yourself together!

695
01:05:40,564 --> 01:05:41,615
Mom!

696
01:05:41,845 --> 01:05:42,917
- Mom!
- Kang Ae!

697
01:05:42,988 --> 01:05:45,457
- Mom, what's wrong? Mom!
- Pull yourself together!

698
01:05:45,709 --> 01:05:47,402
Mom, Mom!

699
01:05:47,448 --> 01:05:48,780
Can you hear me?

700
01:05:49,205 --> 01:05:52,548
- What's wrong? Kang Ae!
- Mom!

706
01:06:11,299 --> 01:06:12,953
<i>Even if you can't see Mom with your eyes, </i>

707
01:06:13,008 --> 01:06:15,360
<i>you have to remember that Mom is always by your side.</i>

708
01:06:15,547 --> 01:06:16,727
<i>No matter where you go.</i>

709
01:06:16,796 --> 01:06:18,894
Hey, Kang Ae?

710
01:06:18,936 --> 01:06:20,700
<i>Isn't there anything that can be done?</i>

711
01:06:20,792 --> 01:06:22,606
<i>My beloved Da Mi,</i>

712
01:06:23,686 --> 01:06:28,308
<i>Because of you, Mom has been very happy.</i>

713
01:06:28,891 --> 01:06:31,902
<i>Watching you smile, watching you persevere.</i>

714
01:06:31,931 --> 01:06:34,780
<i>That's why I can stand up again.</i>

715
01:06:35,141 --> 01:06:37,606
<i>If Mom forces you to do anything,</i>

716
01:06:37,996 --> 01:06:43,030
<i>it's also because Mom is loving you deeply.</i>

717
01:06:50,646 --> 01:06:52,934
<i>I'm sorry, Kang Ae.</i>

718
01:06:53,294 --> 01:06:55,206
<i>I'm sorry!</i>
