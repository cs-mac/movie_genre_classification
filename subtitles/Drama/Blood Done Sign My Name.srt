♫ Last Sunday morning ♫

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,350
♫ The sunshine
Felt like rain ♫

5
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:23,022
♫ The week before,
They all seemed the same ♫

6
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:26,066
♫ With the help of God
And true friends ♫

7
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:28,902
♫ I come to realize ♫

8
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:31,238
♫ I still had
Two strong legs ♫

00:00:31,322 --> 00:00:33,574
♫ And even wings to fly ♫

♫ Oh, I ain't wasting
Time no more ♫

(woman)
We heard it on the radio.
ln the songs, you could tell

14
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,505
that there was a movement--

15
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:49,840
(woman 2)
Because we were hearing
what was going on

16
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:50,883
all over
the country.

17
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:52,718
Yes, yes.

18
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:54,178
And it seemed like
it was real everywhere

19
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:55,679
but here.
What happened?

20
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:57,931
How did we get
left behind?

21
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:02,561
(man)
I lived in this part of
North Carolina all my life.

22
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:09,526
Back in 1 970, these fields
were flat-covered in tobacco.

23
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:11,570
Far as you could see.

24
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:14,948
lf tobacco was the blood
of eastern North Carolina,

25
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,117
then Oxford was its heart.

26
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:22,081
For 300 years, tobacco flowed
through those old warehouses.

27
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:25,375
And like blood,
it kept people alive--

28
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,794
black and white.

29
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,545
After having served
in Vietnam,

30
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,965
and having many
black soldiers
around me,

31
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:35,427
where it was
pretty much the norm,

32
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:39,306
I come back home
and only find a
few blacks

33
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,225
on the Highway Patrol
at the time,

34
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,976
it seemed
a little
strange to me.

35
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:45,437
But being
an old North Carolina boy

36
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:48,732
and raised down in New Bern,

37
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:52,069
um, I was surprised,
but at the same time,

38
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:55,781
my background told me
that I wasn't too surprised.

39
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:57,950
Martin Luther King
was never my favorite,

40
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:59,326
but I admired him.

41
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,411
I liked what he stood for.

42
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,455
But after Dickie Marrow
was killed,

43
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,624
nobody was having
that shit anymore.

44
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:09,294
We was about ready
to kick some ass
our own selves.

45
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:41,952
(little boy)
What is it?

46
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:43,203
(older boy)
Shh.

47
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:53,297
See? I told you
Grandma Jessie's rich.

48
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,257
Wow.

49
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:58,302
There's gotta be close to
$10 worth of Cokes
right here.

50
00:02:58,344 --> 00:02:59,803
I'm gonna take one.

51
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,805
She won't miss it.

52
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,515
(man)
Vern, Tim,
come on outside

53
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,892
and say goodbye
to your grandmother.

54
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,643
(grandmother)
Vernon.

55
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:07,853
Saying our goodbyes,
Mother Jessie.

56
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:09,855
Vernon, before you go,

57
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:12,024
there's something serious
l've got to talk
to you about.

58
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,692
lf my boys
broke something, you
know I'm good for it.

59
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:14,860
Bye, Grandma.

60
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:16,195
So long, Grandma!

61
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,989
I n the car!
Okay, last one.

62
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:21,116
Well, I think
we're ready.

63
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:24,661
Martha, I asked Vidalia
to pack a basket of food
for the trip.

64
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,872
Would you go see
if it's ready?

65
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,999
Of course.

66
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,667
[door closes]

67
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,836
Anyway, Vernon,

68
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:36,423
I know you believe
you can talk your way
out of every predicament,

69
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:39,176
but Oxford
is not like Biscoe.

70
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,262
They're more
set in their ways.

71
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,972
Don't you worry,
Mother Jessie.

72
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,641
The Lord hasn't
let us down yet.

73
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:54,608
It's not the Lord
I'm worried about, Vernon.

74
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:57,861
Let's get this show
on the road, Tysons.

75
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,279
Load 'em up.

76
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,782
Oh, I'm gonna
miss you so much.

77
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:03,492
You be sure
and write me, you hear?

78
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:04,868
I will. I'm gonna
miss it here, too.

79
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,954
All right, sweetie. Bye.

80
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:09,748
Bye, Mother Jessie.

81
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:11,083
(both boys)
Bye, Grandma.

82
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:12,834
Vernon, you take
care now.

83
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,670
(Vern)
I don't want to leave.

84
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:16,880
(Tim)
Me, neither.

85
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,590
(Vernon)
Come on, everyone.
We're on an adventure.

86
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,401
[bell rings]

87
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:39,152
Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.

88
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:40,946
I said good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.

89
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,656
(class)
Good morning.

90
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,741
Welcome to
third period English.

91
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:47,411
My name is Mr. Chavis.

92
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:52,040
And I'm your teacher.

93
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,959
lf you could, turn
with me to page 1 5
in your textbooks.

94
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:56,420
We'll be covering
Ralph Ellison.

95
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:00,048
Mr. Chavis.

96
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,009
Yes.

97
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,677
you really know
Stokely Carmichael
the Black Panther?

98
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:06,179
Yes. I know him.

99
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:09,933
When I was at U NCC, I had him
speak to a student assembly.

100
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,685
And they let
you do that?

101
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:14,354
Sure. I was head
of the Student Union.

102
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:17,607
And I thought it would be
a good idea if people heard
what he had to say.

103
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,609
What's a
Student Union?

104
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:29,619
What's a Student Union?

105
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:33,498
A Student Union is basically
an organization of students,

106
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:39,004
a place to meet,
discuss ideas,
affect change.

107
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:41,465
Any other questions
before we start?

108
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:44,634
Yeah. Why'd you ever want
to come back to Oxford?

109
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,906
Are you sure you priced
this flour right?

110
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,534
I can get it over at the A&P
for almost 50 cents less.

111
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:12,871
Then you just walk
another mile and a half
over there and buy it.

112
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,751
May I have a bag, please?

113
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,360
(Tim)
Why do we have a house
with furniture already in it?

114
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:45,028
(Martha)
Because the church
owns it, honey.

115
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,406
It's not ours.

116
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,741
Remember the one
where all the furniture
was covered in plastic?

117
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:53,537
(Vernon)
Hah. That was a long
time ago, little buck.

118
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,581
Oh, Vernon,
it's beautiful.

119
00:06:56,666 --> 00:07:00,877
I just hope they haven't
completely redecorated
the place.

120
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,256
Just once, l'd like
to paint our home myself.

121
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:08,385
Okay, everyone,
best behavior.

122
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,429
Let's go, Tysons.

123
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,901
Reverend Tyson ! Hi.

124
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,611
You must be Martha.

125
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,071
Yes, hi.

126
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,531
I'm lsabel Taylor,
and on behalf

127
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,575
of the ladies
of First Methodist,

128
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:34,077
welcome to Oxford
and your new home.

129
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,954
We knew y'all would
be getting in late,

130
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:38,081
so we just
dropped off
a few things

131
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,417
so you'd have
something for supper.

132
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,420
Well, thank you.
Everything looks
so nice.

133
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,590
We painted
the whole house
and redid the drapes.

134
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,925
You shouldn't have.

135
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,302
Well, I don't
mean to be rude,

136
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:52,679
but I need to
excuse myself.

137
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:55,474
But you ladies,
you feel free to
stay and just visit

138
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:56,683
for as long
as you like.

139
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,477
See you Sunday.

140
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,438
(woman)
Sure you don't need
any help unpacking?

141
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:28,275
No, thanks,
I'm fine. Bye.

142
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:31,653
Oh, Lord, not again.

143
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:48,211
[sighs]

144
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,380
[knocking]

145
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,756
Come in.

146
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,592
(Roseanna)
Mrs. Tyson?

147
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,010
Yes?

148
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:58,388
Hi. My name is
Roseanna Allen.

149
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:01,766
I'm a friend of Vidalia,
who works for your mother.

150
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:05,061
She said you might be
needing some help.

151
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:07,188
Roseanna, you
are a godsend.

152
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:01,368
(woman)
Ben, is that you?

153
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,620
Yeah, it's me, Mom.

154
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:08,792
Oh, good.
Dinner's ready.

155
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:11,127
(mom)
And all you could see
were these little feet

156
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,545
running down the hall,
just bare bottomed,

157
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,631
and him chasing him.
It was so--

158
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:15,965
(woman)

mad because they
broke the vase.

we've had that, though?

is either a man

with a
total disregard
for his career,

269

bravest preachers

You know, Reverend,
l've been a member
of that church

279
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:01,954

But they all fell
into two groups.

00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,996
Yeah. I agree
with you, Eddie.

315
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,665
Ain't nothing
gonna happen--

316
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,292
unless you make
it happen.

317
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:19,675
(male voice)
No one's saying you
don't work hard, Robert.

318
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:23,012
Jesus. You work
like a slave.

319
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:25,848
It's just that some folks
downtown want to make sure

320
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:30,353
you got things under
control out here,
that's all.

321
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:34,106
Now you tell those folks
not to worry about
their investment.

322
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:36,442
Ain't nobody
gonna mess with
me out here.

323
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:39,195
I got friends who'll
guarantee me of that.

324
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:41,197
The change
machine's empty
in the laundromat.

325
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:42,573
Hello, Mr. Watkins.

326
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,033
Larry, how you
doing, son?

327
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:45,159
Fine, sir!

328
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:49,038
[cash register

329
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:50,748
Now you have
a good day.

330
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:56,087
Howdy.

331
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:57,880
What you need?

332
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,257
Driving by,
see the shop,

333
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,842
realize I'm due
for a haircut.

334
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:04,553
No.

335
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:05,763
No?

336
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:07,265
No what?

337
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,808
I need to make
an appointment?

338
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:11,060
No.

339
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:13,312
I don't cut
y'all's hair here.

340
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,569
All right, all right.

341
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,238
No problem.

342
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,532
I'll go to a fellow
in town I know.

343
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,995
Y'all have a good day.

344
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,502
You know what, Robert?

345
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:38,629
You've got
a good thing
going on out here.

346
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:41,465
lf you don't die
of a heart attack
trying to keep it up

347
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,760
and if you
keep that temper of
yours under control,

348
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,096
you might
just end up
a rich man.

349
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,765
Don't you worry
about me, Billy.

350
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,143
I'm gonna be fine.

351
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:55,271
(male voice)
Next order of business,
a request by Mike Taylor

352
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:57,440
for a new stop sign
down his way.

353
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,317
Neil, is
the application
in order?

354
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,319
Yes. We've
been out there
and checked it out.

355
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:04,030
Then I'm looking
for a motion to
move this thing along.

356
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:06,198
Motion.
Second.

357
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,283
All in favor?

358
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:08,617
(many)
Aye.

359
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:10,453
Opposed? Motion carried.

360
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:12,997
Next item.

361
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:16,125
Restoration of
the basketball
rims in city park.

362
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,626
Mr. Chavis, this
is your request?

363
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,170
It is, Your Honor.

364
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:21,964
Looks pretty
straightforward to me.

365
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:24,508
Um...

366
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,552
unfortunately, Mr. Chavis,
we are not

367
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:29,597
the jurisdictional body
you need to be addressing.

368
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:32,016
That would be the town
Recreational Committee,

369
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,143
which meets the first
Tuesday of every month.

370
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:36,062
I have, Your Honor.

371
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,980
I beg your pardon?

372
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:39,815
I have
submitted that request
to the Rec Committee,

373
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,233
but since it never holds
a quorum in its meetings,

374
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:42,651
it can't vote
on that request.

375
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:43,903
Well, better
luck next month.

376
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:45,821
Mr. Mayor,

377
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,990
the Rec Committee has
not held a quorum
since 1964,

378
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,992
which, not coincidentally,

379
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,869
was the year
of the Federal
Civil Rights Act.

380
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:53,662
But, that may be,

381
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,831
but there's nothing
that we can do
about that.

382
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,249
Actually, there is,
Your Honor.

383
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:59,710
Based on the town charter,

384
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,337
if a standing committee
is without a quorum

385
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:03,381
for a period of longer
than six months,

386
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:07,176
then it's possible
for this council--
to call for a vote.

387
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,178
Neil?

388
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:11,347
He is correct,
Your Honor.

389
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:14,266
But only if there is
a quorum present

390
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,102
at the time
the vote is called.

391
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:23,734
[clears throat]

392
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,699
Your Honor
and everybody,

393
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:33,702
I'm sorry, but I forgot
I need to leave
early tonight.

394
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:42,461
I'm afraid I have
to leave early as
well, Your Honor.

395
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:48,926
Well, that leaves us
without a quorum.

396
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:52,513
Adjourned.

397
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:09,530
How'd it go?

398
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:16,078
What was that
Frederick Douglass quote

399
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:19,081
your father was always
so fond of reciting?

400
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,625
Power concedes nothing...

401
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,253
Without a demand.

402
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:26,755
Yeah, well,
I demanded.

403
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:29,341
The power
just rolled
right over me.

404
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:31,969
Well, I don't think
Frederick Douglass

405
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:36,765
expected the
power to yield
on his first attempt.

406
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,976
[chuckles]

407
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,353
I guess he didn't.

408
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:43,355
Get some rest, son.

409
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,690
Night, Momma.

410
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:02,541
Pack of menthol
Rx, please.

411
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:05,836
What you trying
to pull, boy?

412
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:09,632
They're--for
my momma, sir.

413
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:13,135
Yeah?

414
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:15,471
Then she ought to know
that they're 35 cents.

415
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:26,148
Why'd you tell him
these were for
your momma?

416
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:30,069
For 35 cents, he'd
sell the baby Jesus
a pack of smokes.

417
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,990
He's got, like,
500 other--

418
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:35,950
(Jebbie)
That was awesome.

419
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,076
Sweet, man.

420
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,994
What the heck?

421
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:41,830
Hey, what're you
niggers doing in
our neighborhood?

422
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:43,707
What're you doing?

423
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:51,173
Y'all better get
your black asses
out of here

424
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:54,218
before we
come over there
and kick them out!

425
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,976
(several)
Run!

426
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:51,609
(Roseanna)
Hey!

427
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:54,111
You get home. Now.

428
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:58,574
[sigh]

429
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:02,119
Thank you, Roseanna.

430
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:04,413
He was gonna
kill me!

431
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,040
And why
would that be?

432
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:09,793
Well, because Jebbie
threw a rock at him.

433
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:13,464
I didn't throw it!

434
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:15,841
Well, it didn't look like
you did much to stop him.

435
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:21,138
You go clean up.

436
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:23,766
And get
them cigarettes
out your back pocket

437
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:26,769
before your momma
gets home.

438
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:31,440
Thanks, Roseanna.

439
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:32,941
Good night.

440
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:34,318
(Vernon)
See you tomorrow.

441
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:53,212
What're you
gonna do?

442
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:56,757
I'm taking you on
a trip, little buck.

443
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:03,055
(Daddy)
Whoo!

444
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:05,099
Come on! Let's go!

445
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,564
Come on, Daddy!

446
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:13,899
Are you
speaking to me?

447
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:15,150
Yeah!

448
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:18,904
Woo-hoo!

449
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:48,308
Daddy?

450
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,479
When are you
gonna talk to me?

451
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:56,859
I'm not, little buck.

452
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:59,319
I'm gonna
show you something.

453
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:53,165
What is it, Daddy?

454
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:57,753
It's a revival!

455
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,588
Tim.

456
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:02,132
Tim. It's
not a revival.

457
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:41,964
(man's voice)
The light of Jesus.

458
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:43,298
(several)
For our God.

459
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,802
The light of Jesus.

460
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,805
(several)
The light of Christ.

461
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,223
The light of Jesus.

462
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:53,141
Deliverance.

463
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:56,645
We are the chosen ones.

464
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:59,773
By the fire of
Calvary's cross

465
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:02,067
and the sentinel
and the bearer of
the light,

466
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:04,736
jointly give birth
to the star.

467
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:06,864
For our God.
For our God.

468
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:10,242
Let the
circles of light
become alive.

469
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:14,663
The light of Christ.

470
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:17,666
We mean to cleanse
and purify
our virtues

471
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:23,046
by burning out our
vices from the fire
of His word.

472
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:24,923
The light of Christ.

473
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:27,384
Honor,

474
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:32,848
truth, loyalty, purity.

475
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,017
For our God.
For our God.

476
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:37,936
[cheering]

477
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:41,940
I want to go, Daddy.

478
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:43,984
Shh.

479
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,527
(faint)
Please, Daddy.
I want to go home now.

480
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:47,863
Let the circle
truly become

481
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:50,866
a living representation
of our order

482
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:54,036
in the darkness
of the world.

483
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:12,179
When I saw the cross,
I thought everything
was good.

484
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:16,892
Evil can sometimes be
hard to recognize.

485
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,227
It hides in
normal things.

486
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:21,438
People you
think you know.

487
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:27,069
But recognizing evil
isn't the hardest part.

488
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:29,112
It's standing
up to it,

489
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:31,031
even when nobody
else will.

490
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:38,914
(Dr. Proctor)
So essentially, the
quality of our choices

491
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:41,416
determine the quality
of our lives.

492
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:44,461
Which, translated, means
you probably need to work
a little harder.

493
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:50,759
[whispering]
Thank you.

494
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:56,098
Dr. Proctor, my name is
Reverend Vernon Tyson.

495
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,474
Reverend Tyson.

496
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:59,518
Please.

497
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:03,105
I'm the pastor
at the Oxford
Methodist Church.

498
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:04,940
I heard you
preach last year

499
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,441
at the North Carolina
Council of Churches.

500
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:08,694
You gave a
magnificent speech.

501
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:11,989
Well, thank you,
Reverend Tyson.

502
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:17,452
But I'm assuming that
wasn't the only reason
you came to see me.

503
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:19,287
So he said yes.

504
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:21,790
And we'll get run out
of town together.
[chuckles]

505
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,375
You might be
right about that.

506
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:25,293
Well, I think
you're overreacting.

507
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,462
I'm just
saying there are
people in this town

508
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:30,007
who think that things
have moved awfully fast
in a very short time

509
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:32,551
and maybe
they should just--
slow down a bit.

510
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:34,886
Well, if anybody
bothered to ask the
blacks in this town,

511
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:38,181
they'd tell you if things
went any slower they'd
be going backward.

512
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:42,019
At the very least
don't you think you
should've consulted

513
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:44,813
with the Executive Committee
before inviting him to speak?

514
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:47,858
Dr. Samuel Proctor
is one of the leading
educators in America.

515
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:49,568
All the
more embarrassing
if you have to go back

516
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:51,319
and tell
him they won't
let him preach.

517
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:53,822
They? Who is they?

518
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:58,326
You know
full well
who's they.

519
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:01,079
They, who
put bread
on our table.

520
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:05,625
[sigh]

521
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,252
I know what I'm
doing, Martha.

522
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:12,257
Trust me.

523
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:19,681
Just promise you'll give
me 24 hours notice to
start packing.

524
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,933
Bless this food
to the nourishment
of our bodies.

525
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,685
[phone ringing]

526
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,687
May Your goodness
and mercy be upon us

527
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,355
and with those
less fortunate.

528
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,524
I n Your
holy name. Amen.

529
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:30,776
(others)
Amen.

530
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,527
No. I got it.

531
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:40,077
Reverend Tyson.

532
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:41,953
Oh, hello, John.

533
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:43,622
Yes, as a matter of fact,
we just sat down--

534
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:48,043
Yeah, sure, l'd
be happy to listen.

535
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:50,212
I see.

536
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:53,799
Un-huh.

537
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:56,051
Well, I'm sorry
you feel that way,

538
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:59,096
but I'm afraid
I can't do that.

539
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:02,974
No.

540
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:08,814
[phone ringing]

541
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,821
Reverend Tyson.

542
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:17,489
(male voice)
Is it true you invited

543
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:21,284
a nigger to preach
at our church?

544
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,161
Who is this?

545
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:25,247
'Cause if it's true,
you're gonna regret it.

546
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,748
Who is this?

547
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,125
[dial tone]

548
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:39,010
[sigh]

549
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:46,935
(kids, shouting)
Fight! Fight!

550
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,895
Stop it! Stop it!

551
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:51,606
Tim Tyson!

552
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:53,483
What are you doing?

553
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:57,154
He called Daddy
a nigger-lover.

554
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:59,990
Your daddy
doesn't need
you to defend him.

555
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:03,618
I wasn't defending
him, Momma.

556
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:05,495
I was trying
not to be wicked.

557
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,664
Wicked?

558
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:10,876
Daddy says
the wickedest
thing we can do

559
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,212
is to do nothing.

560
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:19,050
[sigh]
Oh, honey.

561
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:20,677
[ding]

562
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:23,305
Dorothy.

563
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:24,806
I came as soon
as I heard.

564
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:27,976
How's Joe?

565
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,477
He's gonna be okay.

566
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,271
Thank God.

567
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:36,818
Vernon...

568
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:42,282
he isn't
gonna want to see
you when he comes out.

569
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:04,095
(Martha)
Vernon? ls that you?

570
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:07,849
Vernon?

571
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:13,855
Dick called.

572
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:18,193
They scheduled
an executive committee
meeting tonight at 7:00.

573
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:24,866
What was I
thinking, Martha?

574
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:28,245
Did I really
believe I could change
everything by myself?

575
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:36,920
You're not changing
anything--by yourself.

576
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,466
I'm here.

577
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,096
Stand your ground.

578
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:50,392
Good evening, everyone.

579
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:51,726
Reverend Tyson.

580
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:53,979
Jack, Mr. Pink.

581
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:54,813
Vernon.

582
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:57,232
Dick.

583
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:59,484
I'm assuming we're
all here tonight

584
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:02,404
because of my invitation
to Dr. Samuel Proctor
to speak this Sunday.

585
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:04,489
Why would you
do this, Vernon?

586
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:06,658
I got people coming
into my store asking me

587
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:08,618
what kind of ship
we're running here.

588
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:10,620
Wanting to know did
we really invite

589
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,664
a Negro preacher
to stand in
our pulpit?

590
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:14,249
And what did you
tell them, Jack?

591
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:16,334
I told them
they heard wrong.

592
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:19,045
Ain't no Negro professor
speaking in our church
on Sunday.

593
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:22,465
Oh, Jack, why in the hell
would you say something
like that?

594
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,634
'Cause it's the
truth, Thad!

595
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:27,804
Vernon, nobody's saying
that it's perfect here,

596
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:31,308
but we've got good relations
with the Negro community.

597
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:34,769
This might not be time
to--to stir things up.

598
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:37,105
What time is
a good time, Dick?

599
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:39,774
A year from now?

600
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:41,985
What, five years
from now, Doug?

601
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:44,654
Does that sound about right?
Once your boys graduate
high school?

602
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:48,450
Ten years from now? Heck,
this is starting to sound
like work.

603
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:53,038
Why don't we just
leave it for the next
generation to fix?

604
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:54,664
lf this man
speaks on Sunday,

605
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,458
there will
be a breach

606
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:58,626
that will split
this congregation.

607
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:02,881
Is he worth tearing
this church apart over?

608
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:11,389
You, um, you can end
this with one
call, Vernon.

609
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:14,934
Just call him
and tell him
don't come.

610
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,484
We're living beneath
a dam, gentlemen,

611
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:26,154
a dam that's holding back
300 years of wrong.

612
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:28,323
Now, you can say that dam
ain't going to break

613
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:30,158
all you want,
but when the rains come

614
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:32,494
and that dam bursts open

615
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:34,496
and all that's bad
comes flooding out,

616
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:38,083
you won't have time
to run for high ground.

617
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:41,002
Now is the time.

618
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:45,090
That's why
I invited him.

619
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:47,842
And that's why I'm not
making that phone call.

620
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:49,677
Well, that's all
well and good, Vernon,

621
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:51,429
but this is
our church,

622
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:54,182
and you don't have
a right to do this.

623
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:56,935
Well, actually,
Jack, I do. And
you gave it to me.

624
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:59,687
This is the Methodist
Book of Discipline.

625
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:02,357
It defines the
rules that govern
our denomination.

626
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:04,359
And it says--

627
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,611
"the pastor
of this church
can determine the number

628
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:09,614
and the nature of services
held in the sanctuary."

629
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:15,036
And for the moment,
I am still the pastor
of this church.

630
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:18,456
Now, if you see
things differently,

631
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:22,544
you give Bishop
Grayson Tullis
a phone call

632
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:24,337
and you let him know.

633
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:27,966
Otherwise, I have a job
to do tomorrow, gentlemen.

634
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:30,677
And I hope to see
you all there.

635
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,348
[organ playing]

636
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:54,451
Reverend Tyson?

637
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:57,328
You never asked me what I
was going to speak about.

638
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:59,456
No, sir.

639
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:03,251
I didn't think
that was my place.

640
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,752
Thank you.

641
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:12,802
Shall we face
the lions?

642
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:15,096
[chuckles]

643
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:39,329
I come to you today

644
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:43,291
to talk about a problem
of enormous magnitude.

645
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:46,628
Something some of you would
probably rather not hear about.

646
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:50,840
But it is a subject
that affects us.

647
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:53,468
I am the president
of North Carolina A&T,

648
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:55,345
a black university
of approximately 4,000--

649
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:56,971
I'll be right back.

650
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:58,640
outstanding young men
and women.

651
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:00,642
Among our many fine
accomplishments

652
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:02,393
is our football program.

653
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:05,313
The other day,
my coach came in
to see me.

654
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:07,732
He told me
that the finest
running back

655
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:10,568
he had ever seen
is down at New Bern.

656
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:15,323
Now, this prospect's daddy
and his brother both went
to A&T.

657
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:17,367
But when my coach went
down to recruit him,

658
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:19,994
he say he ain't
coming to A&T.

659
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:22,580
Said he's going to school
over at Chapel Hill,

660
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:24,874
says he's going to play
for the Tarheels.

661
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:28,044
They got the big school
over there, big money,

662
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:31,839
the big stadium, and he's
going to play for them.

663
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:34,050
Then my poor coach
drove over to Kinston

664
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:37,011
to see about this 300-pound
offensive tackle they got

665
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:39,347
at the Negro
high school there.

666
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:41,015
A fine young man,
good grades,

667
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:44,102
but he say he ain't
coming to A&T, either.

668
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:46,688
That his mama wants him
to play for N .C. State

669
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:50,400
and wear the red and white
of the Wolfpack.

670
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:53,111
Well, when Coach finished,
he looked at me defeated,

671
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:55,572
and said, "I'm sorry,
but we're going to struggle

672
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:57,031
"next year
on the football field

673
00:42:57,116 --> 00:43:01,035
and probably
for years to come."

674
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:04,497
l've never seen
a sadder man.

675
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:10,044
I walked over
and put an arm
around him and said,

676
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:12,880
"See, that's the problem
with all this integration,

677
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:17,218
Coach, that's just the price
we're going to have to pay."

678
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:20,138
[laughter]

679
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:29,564
Our lesson today comes
from the Book of John.

680
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:32,817
Willie Mae? You
listening to
the radio?

681
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:41,451
Willie Mae?

682
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:42,577
(little girl, happily)
Daddy!

683
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:46,581
[happy sob]

684
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:59,761
[loud music,
cheerful whooping]

685
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:01,679
[chatter]

686
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:21,199
[indistinct chatter]

687
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:24,202
What'd they feed you
over there, boy?
You're getting big.

688
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:27,330
Ah ! Cockroaches.
[laughs]

689
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:30,291
Take this off, handsome.

690
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,126
How are y'all all doing?

691
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:35,046
You're looking great,
looking great.

692
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:38,216
That Miss Mary Catherine?

693
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,467
How you doing, son?

694
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:41,386
Hey, Mr. Yancey.

695
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:42,804
Thank you
for coming tonight.
I really appreciate it.

696
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:43,846
You look great.
You look great.

697
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:45,640
Thank you, sir.

698
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:47,350
Still growing up like a weed,
but you look great.

699
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:49,060
Thank you.
See you guys
in a little bit.

700
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:50,645
See you.

701
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:53,731
How you doing, man?

702
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:56,693
Fanny. Hey, baby,
how you doing?

703
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,823
It's good to see you.

704
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:02,907
Good to see you.
I'll see you
in a little bit.

705
00:45:02,991 --> 00:45:04,158
Hey, Roseanna.

706
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:05,284
Hey.

707
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:06,744
You look wonderful.

708
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:07,829
Auntie Roberta.

709
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:09,163
Wonderful.

710
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:10,415
Give me some
of that sugar.

711
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:12,583
Yes. Yes.

712
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:15,545
Dickie, we took care
of Willie Mae and the
girls for you.

713
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:16,921
Just like you
took care of me.

714
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:18,589
Yes.

715
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:19,882
Now it's your turn
to take care of them.

716
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:23,052
I will.
I promise.

717
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:33,688
Hey, darling.

718
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:36,691
Betsy, you didn't let him
touch none of this food,
did you?

719
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:40,069
Well, well, well.
What the cat
dragged in.

720
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:42,530
How's life at
the rubber plant?

721
00:45:42,614 --> 00:45:45,700
It's good. They're starting
up a late shift next week,

722
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:47,869
but I ain't
too interested in that.

723
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:50,121
Well, good. You can
help me down at
the store

724
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:51,539
in all your
spare time.

725
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:55,126
[sigh]

726
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:09,223
Did you put that chain
on that boat trailer
like I told you?

727
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:10,475
Yeah.

728
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:12,059
Well, you better have.

729
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:13,811
You let something
like that slip

730
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:16,022
and you go back
and that boat
won't be there.

731
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:18,775
The chain's there. Boat'll
be there when we get back.

732
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:20,818
Like that time
you left the
bolt undone

733
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:23,654
on the back door and
they stole us blind
down at the shop.

734
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:24,906
That was
an accident.

735
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:26,240
Took care of that.

736
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:27,658
Yeah, when it
was too late.

737
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:29,410
You need to use
your head, son.

738
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:30,787
Yes, sir.

739
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:32,830
Betsy went to
the doctor today.

740
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:34,916
The baby's doing fine.
Everything looks okay.

741
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:37,668
Maybe once that baby
comes, y'all'll come
by more often.

742
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:40,922
You ready to
be a granddaddy?

743
00:46:41,006 --> 00:46:43,424
Hmpf.

744
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:45,593
You ready to be
an uncle, boy?

745
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:47,470
I don't even like
being a brother.

746
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:49,430
[laughs]

747
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:53,142
Go on back upstairs
and start packing
your bags, then.

748
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:55,353
All right, you
see Mr. Fox here?

749
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:57,814
Mr. Fox needs some sleep, too,
just like you need some sleep.

750
00:46:57,898 --> 00:46:59,649
All right? All right.
So get to bed.

751
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:01,943
I'll see you
in the morning.
All right?

752
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:14,622
[tired sigh]

753
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,958
Why don't you
go find Boo

754
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,378
and play
a couple hands
of bid whist.

755
00:47:20,462 --> 00:47:23,464
I know you've been
wanting to catch up.

756
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:27,009
I'll be okay.

757
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:28,845
I'll be back
in a bit.

758
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:31,055
I'll be waiting.

759
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:35,893
Go on.

760
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:41,357
(Fanny)
Who's there?

761
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:43,693
It's Dickie, Fanny.
How you feeling?

762
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:45,444
Oh, I'm hanging
in there.

763
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:47,572
lf you're
looking for Boo,
he ain't here.

764
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:50,074
Think he's
at Four Corners.

765
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:51,826
lf you're
going over there,

766
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:53,494
will you get me
a ice-cold soda?

767
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:54,745
I sure am thirsty.

768
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:56,664
You got it.

769
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:58,332
And don't
go getting
in no trouble.

770
00:47:58,417 --> 00:47:59,500
Bring my soda
right back here
to me.

771
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:01,836
Yes, ma'am.

772
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:18,060
Okay. I took out
the trash and broke
down those boxes.

773
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:19,562
Anything else?

774
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:25,067
Yeah. Go lock up
the barber shop.

775
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:26,861
How much longer
we gonna be here?

776
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:29,113
Well, till the old man
turns the lights out.

777
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:35,119
[whistles]
He closing up?

778
00:48:35,203 --> 00:48:38,456
I'll bet you that's
the last time Roger
comes over for dinner.

779
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:48,424
Hey, Dickie.
Is that you?

780
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:50,968
Yes, ma'am,
Mrs. Downing.

781
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:02,396
Seen Boo?

782
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:03,397
No, man.

783
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:04,607
Nowhere.

784
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:05,858
All right.

785
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:14,367
Hey, girls.

786
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:16,243
Y'all looking
good tonight.

787
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:19,789
Is this where all
the action is?

788
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:26,754
I can't believe y'all
out here all by
y'allselves.

789
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:28,255
Hey, nigger!
Hey, you!

790
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:30,633
That's my wife
you're talking to.

791
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:33,260
Hey, man, listen, I
was just talking to
the sisters here.

792
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:35,179
Right.

793
00:49:35,263 --> 00:49:36,973
Hey, man, it's cool.
Listen, listen.

794
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:38,432
I was just talking
to the sisters over here.

795
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:39,809
The hell you were.

796
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:42,603
Man, what're
you doing?

797
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:44,188
I'll show you
what I'm doing.

798
00:49:44,272 --> 00:49:45,356
[grunts]

799
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,525
(wife)
Larry, no!

800
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:49,360
Hey!

801
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:51,529
Larry, no!

802
00:49:51,613 --> 00:49:53,322
[grunts]

803
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,282
Stop it!
Larry, stop!

804
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:56,742
[wife]
Stop!

805
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:57,910
Damn!

806
00:49:57,995 --> 00:49:59,537
You're crazy, man!

807
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:00,621
[wife]
He's got
a knife!

808
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:06,752
Hey, Dickie!
Dickie, run!

809
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:12,216
Hey, where's the fire?

810
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:13,467
[shotgun blasts echo]

811
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:16,846
[Boo shouts, moaning]

812
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:21,976
[panting]

813
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:23,936
I didn't do nothing!

814
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:50,254
Okay, okay, man.

815
00:50:51,923 --> 00:50:53,674
You got me.

816
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:58,345
Let's just
forget about it.
You got me, man.

817
00:50:58,388 --> 00:50:59,847
Okay?

818
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:12,359
[grunts]

819
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:18,532
[grunting,
fists pounding]

820
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:29,210
[grunts and pounding]

821
00:51:29,294 --> 00:51:32,379
[grunts and thuds]

822
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:37,259
Better stop that
before you kill him!

823
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:39,345
You better get back
in your house, woman!

824
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:40,471
[grunts]

825
00:51:40,555 --> 00:51:45,726
[continued kicking]

826
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:50,272
[heavy breathing]

827
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:54,235
[gunshot]

828
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:57,238
[dog barking in distance]

829
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:02,493
[train whistling in distance]

830
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:13,045
Go lock up the stores.

831
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:36,694
[sobbing wildly]
Oh, God.

832
00:52:36,778 --> 00:52:38,445
Oh, God, Dickie.

833
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:40,781
Ba-bro, get us a car.
Go get us a car!

834
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:42,825
Honey, we got to find him.

835
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:44,869
Oh, dear. Okay,
you look over here.

836
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:46,328
(nurse)
Ma'am, stop.
You can't go in there.

837
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:48,914
Over here.

838
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:50,958
Dickie? Dickie,
it's Roberta.

839
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:52,334
I'm right
here, honey.

840
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:53,294
Ma'am, you'll
have to leave.

841
00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:56,797
Oh, my God!

842
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,674
What have they
done to you?

843
00:52:58,758 --> 00:53:01,385
They're going to have to
take him to Duke Hospital.

844
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:08,767
[ambulance siren wailing]

845
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:40,716
No. No!

846
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,509
I ain't going to no
damn police station.

847
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:43,844
They ain't gonna listen
to a word I got to say.

848
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:46,055
Boo, I'll take you down.

849
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:57,191
Ain't nobody gonna
mess with us.

850
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:59,235
Who's on the desk?

851
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:00,861
Let me speak with him.

852
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:09,578
Dale.

853
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:12,206
Yeah, this is
Billy Watkins.

854
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:14,458
I understand there was
a shooting tonight

855
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:19,129
at, um,
Mr. Teel's store
out at Four Corners.

856
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:23,259
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

857
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:25,219
He's with me.

858
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:28,764
I'll bring him in
a little later.

859
00:54:28,848 --> 00:54:30,808
'Preciate it.

860
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:38,399
Do you still
have people
up in Berea?

861
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:41,443
Yeah.

862
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:43,028
Call 'em. Tell them
you're gonna
be staying

863
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:45,614
with 'em
for a while.

864
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,246
Well, what you
want me to do?

865
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:54,248
Go upstairs.

866
00:54:54,332 --> 00:54:56,583
Get yourself
a pillowcase.

867
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:58,794
Fill it with all
the money you can
put your hands on.

868
00:54:58,878 --> 00:55:01,338
You're gonna need it.

869
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:07,261
Excuse me, Sergeant.

870
00:55:07,345 --> 00:55:09,680
This is
William Chavis.

871
00:55:09,764 --> 00:55:12,808
He was
shot this evening
by Mr. Robert Teel.

872
00:55:12,892 --> 00:55:15,936
Mr. Teel and his sons
killed Dickie Marrow.

873
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:18,105
It was witnessed
by Mr. Chavis

874
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:20,441
and he'd
like to report
that murder,

875
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:23,444
his own assault,
and swear out a warrant
for the Teels' arrest.

876
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:27,531
Have a seat.

877
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:51,305
Sorry.

878
00:55:57,145 --> 00:56:02,483
[sigh]

879
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:19,083
All that time
he was in the service,

880
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:22,753
I prayed that nothing
would happen to him.

881
00:56:22,837 --> 00:56:25,255
I prayed and prayed.

882
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:30,594
Somebody should've told me
I needed to be praying

883
00:56:30,678 --> 00:56:35,099
he wouldn't get shot
in his own hometown.

884
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:08,549
Nothing I can do.

885
00:57:57,348 --> 00:58:00,267
C'mon, Boo.
Let's go home.

886
00:58:12,238 --> 00:58:14,114
John, I just heard.

887
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:15,908
What can I do?

888
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:22,247
It's too
late, Vernon.
Too late.

889
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:24,333
Go on home.

890
00:58:32,884 --> 00:58:34,510
Oh, nice one.

891
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:35,677
So close.

892
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:37,137
Hey, where you been?

893
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,181
Home. Y'all hear?

894
00:58:39,265 --> 00:58:41,475
Daddy, Roger, and them
shot them a nigger.

895
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:43,435
Why?

896
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,647
Said something
he shouldn't have
to Larry's wife Judy.

897
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:49,650
Tim Tyson.

898
00:58:49,734 --> 00:58:50,984
Come in for supper.

899
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:53,070
What're we having?

900
00:58:53,154 --> 00:58:55,072
I am not
announcing my menu
to the neighborhood.

901
00:58:55,156 --> 00:58:56,782
Come in now.

902
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:17,553
[rumble of thunder]

903
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:23,225
Shh. It's only me.

904
00:59:25,603 --> 00:59:27,229
Daddy.

905
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:32,192
Is everything
going to be okay?

906
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:34,319
Go to sleep,
little buck.

907
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:11,607
[indistinct shout]

908
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:13,609
Y'all, come on.

909
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:22,367
[shouting]

910
01:00:29,751 --> 01:01:31,603
[shouting continues]

911
01:02:15,773 --> 01:02:17,816
Let's go around back.

912
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:26,700
[siren approaches]

913
01:02:41,382 --> 01:02:43,550
[shouting and noise fade]

914
01:02:50,808 --> 01:02:53,226
(mayor)
Quiet, please.

915
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:55,437
This morning,
I dispatched a telegram
to the Governor's office

916
01:02:55,521 --> 01:02:58,440
informing him
of the events
of last night,

917
01:02:58,524 --> 01:03:02,402
as well as my intention
to declare the existence
of a state of emergency

918
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:05,405
and the imposing
of a curfew for
all citizens

919
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:09,409
from 7:30 in the evening
until 6 in the morning,
beginning tonight.

920
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:14,247
Further, I requested
from him the assistance
of State Troopers

921
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:16,166
to help enforce this curfew.

922
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:19,836
And most importantly,
to restore a safe, secure,

923
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:23,590
and law-abiding
environment for the
hearing tomorrow

924
01:03:23,674 --> 01:03:26,968
and for the trial
in the months to come.

925
01:03:32,433 --> 01:03:34,351
All citizens my ass!

926
01:03:34,435 --> 01:03:35,811
Damn right.

927
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:37,395
That curfew
ain't nothing

928
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:38,814
but a No Niggers
After Nightfall Act.

929
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:39,564
(several)
That's right.

930
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:46,404
(teacher)
You can have...

931
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:50,200
whatever you can take.

932
01:03:50,284 --> 01:03:51,701
(student)
Yeah.

933
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:52,953
That's right.

934
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:56,790
Yeah, Mr. Chavis.

935
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:59,459
But you can only keep--

936
01:03:59,544 --> 01:04:01,711
what you can--

937
01:04:04,131 --> 01:04:06,675
hold.

938
01:04:06,759 --> 01:04:08,301
That's right.
We're gonna keep it!

939
01:04:08,344 --> 01:04:09,761
Keep what, Darrel?

940
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:12,973
Beer? Cigarettes?
TV sets?

941
01:04:13,015 --> 01:04:14,933
You think that's why
the State Troopers
are here?

942
01:04:15,017 --> 01:04:17,602
Because you broke
some windows and
stole some groceries?

943
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:19,312
They're not.

944
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:21,356
You want to know
why they're here?

945
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:23,483
They're here
because last night,
when you hit those streets,

946
01:04:23,568 --> 01:04:25,652
you took something
more valuable than you
could ever imagine.

947
01:04:25,736 --> 01:04:28,321
Something our families have
been fighting for for years.

948
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:32,158
I'm talking about equality.

949
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:34,828
And they're not going to let
you keep it without a fight.

950
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:36,580
I ain't giving
it back.

951
01:04:36,664 --> 01:04:37,831
Me, neither.

952
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:39,291
Good.

953
01:04:43,004 --> 01:04:45,547
Mr. Chavis!

954
01:04:45,631 --> 01:04:47,382
Mr. Chavis,
where you going?

955
01:04:49,343 --> 01:04:51,011
What's going on?

956
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:54,556
Come on!

957
01:05:45,066 --> 01:05:48,401
Please take a seat
quickly and quietly.

958
01:05:56,577 --> 01:05:58,119
[gavel pounds]

959
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:09,047
[gavel pounds]
Proceed.

960
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:16,805
I saw three men
standing over Dickie.

961
01:06:16,889 --> 01:06:19,349
Can you
identify those men?

962
01:06:19,433 --> 01:06:22,477
Yes.

963
01:06:22,561 --> 01:06:25,271
Two of them
are over there.

964
01:06:25,314 --> 01:06:28,024
Robert Teel,
he had a shotgun,

965
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:30,402
and Larry Teel,
he had a rifle.

966
01:06:33,864 --> 01:06:35,532
Where's the third man?

967
01:06:35,616 --> 01:06:39,285
Your Honor, none
of the witnesses
were able

968
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:42,664
to positively
identify the third man.

969
01:06:44,458 --> 01:06:46,960
[sigh]

970
01:06:47,044 --> 01:06:48,086
[birds chirping]

[sigh]

972
01:06:52,717 --> 01:06:53,842
Hey, Momma.

973
01:06:53,926 --> 01:06:54,968
Hey.

974
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:06,479
I took my students
to the Teel hearing today.

975
01:07:06,564 --> 01:07:08,732
I heard.

976
01:07:08,816 --> 01:07:10,483
Quite a show.

977
01:07:10,568 --> 01:07:13,820
Yeah, it was
a show, all right.

978
01:07:13,904 --> 01:07:19,659
I just wanted them
to witness the legal
process, you know?

979
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:22,871
All they saw was
the same old Oxford.

980
01:07:22,955 --> 01:07:26,166
Every rich businessman
in town sang that
killer's praises

981
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:29,919
like he was
the Lord Jesus himself.

982
01:07:30,004 --> 01:07:31,838
I made a
phone call today.

983
01:07:34,467 --> 01:07:37,385
I called
Ralph Abernathy.

984
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:39,929
He's sending
someone to help.

985

Good morning, gentlemen.

993
01:08:15,633 --> 01:08:17,801
I thought I
was coming
to a funeral.

994
01:08:17,885 --> 01:08:20,804
You fellows
look like you're
expecting an attack.

995
01:08:20,888 --> 01:08:23,640
We're expecting a
fellow from out of
state to stir things up.

996
01:08:23,724 --> 01:08:25,475
Stir things up?
What's his name?

997
01:08:25,559 --> 01:08:27,227
His name's Frinks.

998
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:29,229
Golden Frinks?

999
01:08:29,313 --> 01:08:31,064
He's coming here?

1000
01:08:31,148 --> 01:08:33,233
Hoo-hoo, hell
of a speaker.

1001
01:08:33,275 --> 01:08:35,110
That man can flat-out
ring the bells of heaven

1002
01:08:35,194 --> 01:08:36,611
when you get him going.

1003
01:08:36,695 --> 01:08:38,822
You ever heard him preach?

1004
01:08:38,906 --> 01:08:40,448
No. Can't say
that we have.

1005
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:42,617
Hot as a pepper.

1006
01:08:42,701 --> 01:08:44,160
He was with
the late Dr. King

1007
01:08:44,245 --> 01:08:45,745
in Selma, Montgomery,
and Birmingham.

1008
01:08:45,830 --> 01:08:47,747
I heard he been
arrested over 50 times

1009
01:08:47,832 --> 01:08:49,707
for his civil
rights involvement.

1010
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:51,292
And on top of
all of that,

1011
01:08:51,377 --> 01:08:53,253
he's a hell of
a sharp dresser.

1012
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:54,754
You boys ever seen
a picture of him?

1013
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:56,005
No, sir.

1014
01:08:56,090 --> 01:08:58,007
He always wears
a dashiki

1015
01:08:58,092 --> 01:09:00,677
with a big cross
'round his neck.

1016
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,432
But stir things up?

1017
01:09:06,517 --> 01:09:09,727
Now, I don't
know how you can
stir up a funeral.

1018
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:14,983
We can't
let you in,
Mr. Frinks.

1019
01:09:17,069 --> 01:09:20,613
I understand.
I understand completely.

1020
01:09:20,698 --> 01:09:22,157
I see them watches.

1021
01:09:22,241 --> 01:09:23,950
You boys
get them
in Vietnam?

1022
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:25,660
Yes, sir.

1023
01:09:25,744 --> 01:09:28,788
Well, you know
Dickie Marrow
was a vet, too.

1024
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:30,707
He served.

1025
01:09:30,791 --> 01:09:33,626
He was a soldier,
just like y'all.

1026
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:37,172
And he deserves
a whole lot better
than all of this.

1027
01:09:44,805 --> 01:09:46,306
No, sir, Mr. Jones.

1028
01:09:46,348 --> 01:09:49,100
You're not too late.
Go right ahead.

1029
01:09:52,605 --> 01:09:55,857
(pastor)
...one of the closest
Scriptures in my heart,

1030
01:09:55,941 --> 01:09:57,275
and I say that--

1031
01:09:57,359 --> 01:09:58,943
[spectators]
Praise the Lord.

1032
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:03,156
I n the name
of our Lord, the Almighty.

1033
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:04,490
Amen.

1034
01:10:04,533 --> 01:10:05,658
(spectators)
Amen.

1035
01:10:07,328 --> 01:10:09,329
Amen.

1036
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:13,625
Yes. Amen.

1037
01:10:15,753 --> 01:10:18,922
Pastor, could I
say a few words?

1038
01:10:19,006 --> 01:10:20,924
Thank you.

1039
01:10:27,473 --> 01:10:29,057
This young man--

1040
01:10:29,141 --> 01:10:34,604
was a husband,
he was a daddy.

1041
01:10:34,688 --> 01:10:39,108
He was a son, an uncle...

1042
01:10:39,193 --> 01:10:41,277
and a cousin.

1043
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:47,450
For 30 years, l've been
attending the funerals
of soldiers.

1044
01:10:47,534 --> 01:10:49,577
Soldiers of the movement.

1045
01:10:51,789 --> 01:10:53,373
And l've had
enough of it.

1046
01:10:53,415 --> 01:10:55,583
(several)
Yes, sir.

1047
01:10:55,668 --> 01:10:59,921
Now, I know we're here
to bury Dickie Marrow today,

1048
01:11:00,005 --> 01:11:02,632
but when I look
in your faces,

1049
01:11:02,716 --> 01:11:06,886
I see there's
something else
that needs to be buried.

1050
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:08,304
Discrimination.

1051
01:11:08,389 --> 01:11:10,056
(several)
Yes.

1052
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:11,474
Segregation.

1053
01:11:11,558 --> 01:11:12,642
(several)
That's right.

1054
01:11:12,726 --> 01:11:13,559
(woman)
Amen. Yes.

1055
01:11:13,644 --> 01:11:14,811
Bigotry!

1056
01:11:14,895 --> 01:11:16,062
(several)
That's right!

1057
01:11:16,146 --> 01:11:18,064
And all the complicity

1058
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:19,732
of pulling a people down.

1059
01:11:19,817 --> 01:11:21,192
(many)
Yeah!

1060
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:23,444
(man)
That's right! Yes!

1061
01:11:23,529 --> 01:11:26,406
Now, to them downtown
who put that statue up,

1062
01:11:26,448 --> 01:11:27,740
this young man here

1063
01:11:27,825 --> 01:11:30,410
is just another
nigger dead.

1064
01:11:30,494 --> 01:11:31,869
(man)
Yeah.

1065
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:34,580
But it ain't
gonna end that way

1066
01:11:34,665 --> 01:11:37,250
'cause what's
gonna end up
dead is Jim Crow!

1067
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:38,584
Jim Crow's
gonna be dead.

1068
01:11:38,669 --> 01:11:40,169
(Boo)
Yes.

1069
01:11:40,254 --> 01:11:43,589
Now, I
know we ain't
got no permit.

1070
01:11:43,632 --> 01:11:46,592
We ain't got nothing.

1071
01:11:46,677 --> 01:11:48,136
But we are marching on.

1072
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:49,971
(several)
That's right.
M m-hmm.

1073
01:11:50,055 --> 01:11:52,640
We're going to go march

1074
01:11:52,725 --> 01:11:56,936
to that Confederate
monument downtown,

1075
01:11:56,979 --> 01:11:59,355
and we're going to tell
that old soldier

1076
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:01,190
it's time for him
to come down.

1077
01:12:01,275 --> 01:12:03,276
(many voices assent)

1078
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:05,194
And that South
that he's guarding

1079
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:08,614
for all those
years is dead.

1080
01:12:08,699 --> 01:12:10,825
And we will
tell him loud, like,

1081
01:12:10,909 --> 01:12:12,785
because he's a old man

1082
01:12:12,870 --> 01:12:14,787
and he has a hard time
hearing these kind
of things.

1083
01:12:14,872 --> 01:12:16,456
(man)
Preach it now,
preach it.

1084
01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:20,460
You don't represent us,
and you never did!

1085
01:12:20,544 --> 01:12:23,463
(woman)
Yes! Go ahead!

1086
01:12:23,505 --> 01:12:25,798
This here is
our South, too!

1087
01:12:25,841 --> 01:12:27,467
(man)
That's right.

1088
01:12:27,551 --> 01:12:30,303
We were born here...

1089
01:12:30,387 --> 01:12:33,181
grew up here...

1090
01:12:33,265 --> 01:12:35,892
work here...

1091
01:12:35,976 --> 01:12:38,227
raise our
children here...

1092
01:12:38,312 --> 01:12:39,812
Yes, Lord.

1093
01:12:39,897 --> 01:12:43,691
and we ain't gonna
be silent no more!

1094
01:12:43,776 --> 01:12:45,985
(many)
No more!

1095
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:47,695
And then we're
going to tell him

1096
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:50,239
that this
young man here,
Dickie Marrow,

1097
01:12:50,324 --> 01:12:51,574
didn't die for nothing.

1098
01:12:51,658 --> 01:12:53,493
Yes, sir.

1099
01:12:53,535 --> 01:12:55,078
He died for us.

1100
01:12:55,162 --> 01:12:57,372
(several)
Yes, he did.

1101
01:12:57,456 --> 01:12:59,665
And we're never
gonna forget it.

1102
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:01,334
Never!

01:24:48,333 --> 01:24:50,793
(crowd)
Yeah!

1266
01:24:50,877 --> 01:24:52,294
[knocking]

1267
01:24:52,378 --> 01:24:54,588
Jesus rode
into Jerusalem

1268
01:24:54,672 --> 01:24:56,590
on the back
of a donkey.

1269
01:24:56,674 --> 01:24:58,926
Ain't nobody
in there.

1270
01:24:59,010 --> 01:25:02,888
Willie Mae and her two
beautiful daughters--

1271
01:25:02,931 --> 01:25:05,224
I thought you said
Mr. Frinks contacted
the Governor.

1272
01:25:05,266 --> 01:25:07,142
That's what he
said. That's
what he told me.

1273
01:25:09,729 --> 01:25:13,315
So many long, hot miles.

1274
01:25:13,399 --> 01:25:16,443
50 long, hot miles
to bring us right
here today.

1275
01:25:16,528 --> 01:25:18,320
(crowd)
Yes!

1276
01:25:18,404 --> 01:25:20,030
All those
people who walked

1277
01:25:20,115 --> 01:25:22,241
thought we
were talking
to the Governor.

1278
01:25:23,827 --> 01:25:26,411
My girls rode
all the way here.

1279
01:25:26,496 --> 01:25:28,497
For what?

1280
01:25:30,667 --> 01:25:33,502
What?

1281
01:25:33,586 --> 01:25:36,171
Please, just get
me out of here.

1282
01:25:36,256 --> 01:25:37,714
Come on.

1283
01:25:46,808 --> 01:25:48,892
Okay.

1284
01:25:48,977 --> 01:25:54,106
(Frinks)
We will not stop till
we have justice! No!

1285
01:25:54,190 --> 01:25:56,817
And because blood
done signed our names.

1286
01:25:56,901 --> 01:25:59,319
Come on!
[cheering]

1287
01:25:59,404 --> 01:26:02,156
The blood
of Martin Luther King.

1288
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:03,365
Blood of Malcolm X.

1289
01:26:03,449 --> 01:26:04,741
(many)
Yes!

1290
01:26:04,826 --> 01:26:06,285
The blood of Medgar Evers.

1291
01:26:06,327 --> 01:26:07,953
The blood of Dickie Marrow

1292
01:26:08,037 --> 01:26:10,038
brought us here today.

1293
01:26:13,459 --> 01:26:16,044
Wait, they're back.
Let's hear what
they got to say.

1294
01:26:16,129 --> 01:26:18,380
Tell us what
the Governor said.

1295
01:26:18,464 --> 01:26:24,178
Ben Chavis is going to
tell us what Governor
Scott has said.

1296
01:26:28,099 --> 01:26:29,266
(man)
Brother, speak!

1297
01:26:31,394 --> 01:26:35,105
[clears throat]

1298
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:37,232
Governor Scott has chosen
not to meet with us today.

1299
01:26:37,317 --> 01:26:38,400
(many)
What?

1300
01:26:38,484 --> 01:26:40,235
Come on, man.

1301
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:42,988
Neither he nor the
Lieutenant Governor

1302
01:26:43,072 --> 01:26:46,116
nor any of their staff,
though they were told
we were coming,

1303
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:48,577
chose to make
themselves available!

1304
01:26:48,661 --> 01:26:50,871
What the Governor
just told us by
his absence

1305
01:26:50,955 --> 01:26:52,706
is that to the
white power structure,

1306
01:26:52,790 --> 01:26:54,041
Dickie Marrow's just
another nigger dead!

1307
01:26:54,125 --> 01:26:56,335
(crowd)
No!

1308
01:26:56,377 --> 01:26:59,671
Well, Governor,
you mark this day
on your calendar.

1309
01:26:59,756 --> 01:27:01,798
Because the
day for begging
for black people

1310
01:27:01,883 --> 01:27:03,675
in North Carolina is over!

1311
01:27:03,718 --> 01:27:04,885
And you will never
forget this day again!

1312
01:27:04,969 --> 01:27:08,096
[cheering

1313

(Frinks)
So you see what we
accomplished today?

1323
01:27:53,142 --> 01:27:55,227
If we
stick together
and stand together,

1324
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:56,603
there's nothing
we can't do.

1325
01:27:56,688 --> 01:27:58,814
See you on the bus.

1326
01:28:04,570 --> 01:28:06,989
You told Willie Mae
that we was going to meet
with the Governor

1327
01:28:07,073 --> 01:28:08,573
when you knew
he wouldn't see
us, didn't you?

1328
01:28:08,658 --> 01:28:11,243
I told her the truth.

1329
01:28:11,286 --> 01:28:14,329
I told her I
notified his office
that we were coming.

1330
01:28:14,414 --> 01:28:16,915
You let her and her
girls ride on top of
that fake coffin

1331
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,626
for 50 miles,
knowing that meeting
wasn't gonna happen.

1332
01:28:19,711 --> 01:28:21,086
That don't bother you?

1333
01:28:21,170 --> 01:28:23,171
You think Dickie
Marrow's murder

1334
01:28:23,256 --> 01:28:25,632
is the worst
civil rights
lynching ever?

1335
01:28:25,717 --> 01:28:28,343
It doesn't even come close
to the things I've seen.

1336
01:28:28,428 --> 01:28:30,429
And you
think her pain
is any different

1337
01:28:30,471 --> 01:28:33,223
from the pain of
those other families?

1338
01:28:33,308 --> 01:28:35,642
Now, what's special
about his death is

1339
01:28:35,727 --> 01:28:38,603
that it gives us
an opportunity to
make things better.

1340
01:28:38,646 --> 01:28:40,647
Who do you
think I am?

1341
01:28:40,732 --> 01:28:42,983
I'm not Dr. King.

1342
01:28:43,067 --> 01:28:46,194
I'm not one
of his golden boys.

1343
01:28:46,279 --> 01:28:47,779
I'm a stoker, man.

1344
01:28:47,822 --> 01:28:50,115
You understand?

1345
01:28:50,199 --> 01:28:54,786
They send me
in to the towns
to keep things hot.

1346
01:28:54,829 --> 01:28:57,456
That's my job.

1347
01:28:57,540 --> 01:29:00,792
I'm just a stoker.

1348
01:29:03,796 --> 01:29:05,797
(anchorman over TV)
In Raleigh today,

1349
01:29:05,882 --> 01:29:07,924
groups of blacks
marched in protest

1350
01:29:08,009 --> 01:29:10,302
over the killing
of a Negro Oxford
man last week.

1351
01:29:10,386 --> 01:29:12,637
Governor Scott's refusal
to meet with black leaders

1352
01:29:12,722 --> 01:29:15,140
has reportedly angered
many of the marchers.

1353
01:29:15,224 --> 01:29:17,642
Local police in Oxford
continue to claim

1354
01:29:17,685 --> 01:29:20,103
that the situation there
is under control.

1355
01:29:22,482 --> 01:29:24,858
Shit, man,
put that damn
thing out.

1356
01:29:28,946 --> 01:29:31,782
Okay, now
we sync watches.

1357
01:29:34,118 --> 01:29:35,494
Sync on five,

1358
01:29:35,536 --> 01:29:37,037

two, one.

1361
01:30:09,487 --> 01:30:11,363

We got a call.
Come on.

[siren wails]

1363
01:30:31,926 --> 01:30:34,386
Let's go.

1365
01:31:16,095 --> 01:31:18,847
(Eddie)
Go, go, go, go. Go!

1366
01:31:42,663 --> 01:31:45,540
Come on.

1367
01:31:45,625 --> 01:31:47,751
Hurry up. Hurry up!

1368
01:31:56,302 --> 01:31:57,802
Eddie, what
you doing, man?

1369
01:31:57,887 --> 01:31:59,471
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1370
01:31:59,514 --> 01:32:02,474
Something's wrong.

1371
01:32:02,517 --> 01:32:03,975
Maybe it didn't catch.

1372
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:06,144
Just give it a second.

1373
01:32:06,187 --> 01:32:07,854
Shit. It didn't catch.

1374
01:32:11,317 --> 01:32:12,567
Eddie!

1375
01:32:12,652 --> 01:32:15,362
Eddie.

1376
01:32:19,033 --> 01:32:22,827
[creaking]

1377
01:32:35,383 --> 01:32:37,634
I think it worked.

1378
01:32:49,897 --> 01:32:52,899
[distant siren wails]

1379
01:33:02,743 --> 01:33:04,619
Daddy?

1380
01:33:25,683 --> 01:33:28,059
It's big.

1381
01:33:28,102 --> 01:33:31,896
Daddy, is it
coming here?

1382
01:33:31,939 --> 01:33:33,773
(Vernon)
Oh, no, honey.

1383
01:33:33,858 --> 01:33:44,743
It's okay.

1384
01:33:58,633 --> 01:34:01,176
Ain't nothing
gonna happen
unless you make it.

1385
01:34:55,022 --> 01:34:58,650
I've presided over several
racially charged cases.

1386
01:34:58,734 --> 01:35:01,861
I harbor no prejudice
against Negroes.

1387
01:35:01,946 --> 01:35:04,823
I was raised
in a mainly black county.

1388
01:35:04,907 --> 01:35:07,867
I ate with them.
I played with them.

1389
01:35:07,952 --> 01:35:10,704
We had an
instinctive love
for the Negro race.

1390
01:35:10,788 --> 01:35:12,330
(crowd)
Black power!

1391
01:35:12,415 --> 01:35:16,042
My secretary is black.

1392
01:35:16,127 --> 01:35:19,379
That should show you
how I feel about them.

1393
01:35:19,463 --> 01:35:21,256
I have heard the arguments

1394
01:35:21,340 --> 01:35:25,009
that this community is
too turbulent
for a trial.

1395
01:35:25,094 --> 01:35:27,011
But I do not feel
they present

1396
01:35:27,096 --> 01:35:29,597
an adequate reason for
moving these proceedings.

1397
01:35:29,682 --> 01:35:31,933
[all talking at once]

1398
01:35:32,017 --> 01:35:35,562
Does it concern you
that only 9 of the
100 juror candidates

1399
01:35:35,646 --> 01:35:37,897
examined for this
trial were black?

1400
01:35:37,982 --> 01:35:40,692
No. Why would
that concern me?

1401
01:35:40,735 --> 01:35:43,945
Because Warren County,
from which the jury
pool is drawn,

1402
01:35:44,029 --> 01:35:46,698
is in fact
more than
2/3 black.

1403
01:35:46,782 --> 01:35:51,828
This is a fair
and impartial jury.

1404
01:35:51,912 --> 01:35:54,831
And it'll be a fair
and impartial trial.

1405
01:36:04,675 --> 01:36:08,052
Mr. Burgwyn, is the
prosecution ready?

1406
01:36:10,306 --> 01:36:11,890
Yes, we are,
Your Honor.

1407
01:36:11,974 --> 01:36:14,559
We call
Dr. Page Hudson
to the stand.

1408
01:36:14,643 --> 01:36:18,646
The deceased
had two serious
fractures of the skull,

1409
01:36:18,731 --> 01:36:21,274
one on the
top of his head,
the other on the back.

1410
01:36:21,358 --> 01:36:24,736
He also had bruises
and abrasions all
over his body,

1411
01:36:24,820 --> 01:36:28,239
both .41 0 and 12-gauge
shotgun wounds on the
backs of his legs,

1412
01:36:28,324 --> 01:36:34,412
as well as a .22-caliber
bullet wound in the center
of his forehead.

1413
01:36:34,497 --> 01:36:36,498
I'd been hanging
with the fellas

1414
01:36:36,582 --> 01:36:38,458
in the shed
at the old
fish market.

1415
01:36:38,542 --> 01:36:42,045
Suddenly I hear Dickie
and a white man arguing.

1416
01:36:44,423 --> 01:36:46,966
That's when I
saw Mr. Teel

1417
01:36:47,051 --> 01:36:48,760
come out the store
with a shotgun.

1418
01:36:48,844 --> 01:36:50,261
And what did you do?

1419
01:36:50,304 --> 01:36:51,429
I ran!

1420
01:36:51,514 --> 01:36:53,932
I mean, we all ran.

1421
01:36:53,974 --> 01:36:57,185
I heard about two
or three shots.

1422
01:36:57,269 --> 01:37:01,356
And, uh, then
I came back.

1423
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:03,066
I saw Larry Teel

1424
01:37:03,150 --> 01:37:06,277
standing over Dickie
with a shotgun.

1425
01:37:06,362 --> 01:37:09,781
I--yelled at him.

1426
01:37:12,785 --> 01:37:14,869
"Stop before you
kill that boy."

1427
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:24,170
Finally, I
heard the shot.

1428
01:37:26,757 --> 01:37:30,718
Who was
holding the rifle,
Mrs. Downing?

1429
01:37:30,803 --> 01:37:33,388
Who was
holding the gun

1430
01:37:33,472 --> 01:37:36,766
that fired
the final shot?

1431
01:37:41,063 --> 01:37:42,438
Him there.

1432
01:37:48,612 --> 01:37:50,530
Larry Teel.

1433
01:37:54,869 --> 01:37:57,704
I was on my way
to find everybody

1434
01:37:57,788 --> 01:38:01,416
when Willie and Jimmie
and them flew by me.

1435
01:38:01,500 --> 01:38:02,959
Then I heard
a shotgun blast.

1436
01:38:08,340 --> 01:38:11,175
And after
they beat him,
what happened?

1437
01:38:11,260 --> 01:38:13,344
There was
one more shot.

1438
01:38:13,429 --> 01:38:15,346
Sounded like
a cap pistol.

1439
01:38:15,431 --> 01:38:17,432
[gunshot]

1440
01:38:20,811 --> 01:38:23,229
No further questions,
Your Honor.

1441
01:38:25,900 --> 01:38:30,111
Boo, have
you ever been
in any trouble?

1442
01:38:32,281 --> 01:38:33,698
Legal trouble?

1443
01:38:33,741 --> 01:38:36,409
Yeah. But I
ain't on trial.

1444
01:38:36,493 --> 01:38:38,786
What kind
of trouble?

1445
01:38:38,871 --> 01:38:40,872
Stuff.

1446
01:38:40,915 --> 01:38:43,249
Receiving stolen goods,

1447
01:38:43,334 --> 01:38:46,586
breaking and entering?

1448
01:38:46,670 --> 01:38:48,087
That kind of stuff?

1449
01:38:48,172 --> 01:38:50,965
Yeah, but I ain't
killed nobody.

1450
01:38:51,050 --> 01:38:54,218
I'm sorry.
I didn't say
you did.

1451
01:38:54,261 --> 01:38:56,554
Did you serve time
for those crimes?

1452
01:38:56,597 --> 01:38:58,723
Yeah.

1453
01:38:58,766 --> 01:39:00,600
In fact, you're on
probation right now,

1454
01:39:00,684 --> 01:39:02,143
isn't that correct?

1455
01:39:02,227 --> 01:39:03,853
Yeah.

1456
01:39:10,569 --> 01:39:13,655
Mr. Chavis,
do you see the man

1457
01:39:13,739 --> 01:39:15,949
that fired the
shot that killed
Dickie Marrow?

1458
01:39:16,033 --> 01:39:17,575
Yes.

1459
01:39:23,082 --> 01:39:25,166
Will you get up
and go over and
touch him?

1460
01:39:25,250 --> 01:39:27,460
Yeah, sure.

1461
01:39:27,544 --> 01:39:29,212
Please.

1462
01:39:44,228 --> 01:39:45,979
Touch him.

1463
01:39:51,151 --> 01:39:53,194
Thank you.
That's all.

1464
01:39:53,278 --> 01:39:58,866
[general murmuring]

1465
01:39:58,951 --> 01:40:01,619
(judge)
Is the defense
ready, Mr. Watkins?

1466
01:40:01,662 --> 01:40:04,539
Yes, we are,
Your Honor.

1467
01:40:04,623 --> 01:40:07,959
What did
Dickie Marrow
say to you?

1468
01:40:08,043 --> 01:40:10,044
He said,
"Hey, white girl."

1469
01:40:10,129 --> 01:40:11,629
"Hey, white girl."

1470
01:40:11,714 --> 01:40:13,798
Huh.

1471
01:40:13,882 --> 01:40:15,800
Had you said
anything to him?

1472
01:40:15,884 --> 01:40:17,135
No, sir.

1473
01:40:17,219 --> 01:40:20,346
And then
what happened?

1474
01:40:20,431 --> 01:40:24,976
And then Larry told him,
"Don't be speaking to
her like that."

1475
01:40:25,019 --> 01:40:26,686
And then he
came at Larry
with a knife,

1476
01:40:26,770 --> 01:40:29,814
and I screamed
for help.

1477
01:40:29,857 --> 01:40:34,485
(Larry Teel)
He said, "Hey, white
girl. Hey, you bitch ."

1478
01:40:34,528 --> 01:40:38,406
I said, "Don't talk
to my wife like that."

1479
01:40:38,490 --> 01:40:43,661
And he said, uh,
"Come on, I'm a
soul brother."

1480
01:40:43,746 --> 01:40:46,080
Then he pulled
his knife on me.

1481
01:40:46,165 --> 01:40:48,499
After he went down,
what happened?

1482
01:40:51,128 --> 01:40:53,546
I hit him
with my fists,

1483
01:40:53,630 --> 01:40:57,842
took the knife
away from him,
then stood up.

1484
01:40:57,926 --> 01:40:59,969
The rifle that
shot him.

1485
01:41:00,054 --> 01:41:01,554
Were you holding
the rifle?

1486
01:41:01,638 --> 01:41:03,389
No, sir.

1487
01:41:03,474 --> 01:41:06,267
Did you see who
was holding it?

1488
01:41:08,228 --> 01:41:11,731
No. I was looking down
at him on the ground.

1489
01:41:11,815 --> 01:41:14,275
Did you recognize
the other men?

1490
01:41:18,947 --> 01:41:20,865
It was
happening so fast.

1491
01:41:20,908 --> 01:41:22,700
The boy attacked me.

1492
01:41:22,785 --> 01:41:24,535
And I ran
after him--

1493
01:41:24,578 --> 01:41:26,120
Larry--

1494
01:41:26,205 --> 01:41:28,247
did you recognize
the other men?

1495
01:41:32,252 --> 01:41:35,421
My father was there.

1496
01:41:35,506 --> 01:41:38,466
I recognized
his voice
when he said,

1497
01:41:38,550 --> 01:41:41,886
"I'm gonna call
an ambulance and
the police."

1498
01:41:41,929 --> 01:41:43,888
And what about
the other man?

1499
01:41:47,518 --> 01:41:49,977
I didn't know
who he was.

1500
01:41:59,571 --> 01:42:02,949
(anchorman over TV)
ln a surprise move
here Thursday, Larry Teel,

1501
01:42:03,033 --> 01:42:05,451
son of a
local barber,
Robert Teel,

1502
01:42:05,536 --> 01:42:08,913
took the witness stand
in Granville County
Superior Court

1503
01:42:08,956 --> 01:42:11,249
and denied that he shot
and killed a local
Negro man.

1504
01:42:11,291 --> 01:42:13,000
(Watkins)
Were you holding
the rifle?

1505
01:42:13,085 --> 01:42:15,086
(Larry)
No, sir.

1506
01:42:15,170 --> 01:42:17,588
(Watkins)
Did you see
who was holding it?

1507
01:42:28,934 --> 01:42:34,856
So tell me, Roger,
one more time,
what happened.

1508
01:42:34,940 --> 01:42:37,859
I heard Judy
call for help.

1509
01:42:37,943 --> 01:42:41,863
I ran after
my father.

1510
01:42:41,947 --> 01:42:44,157
When I got
to the other side
of the fish market,

1511
01:42:44,241 --> 01:42:45,992
I saw him and Larry
and joined them.

1512
01:42:50,164 --> 01:42:52,957
Did Larry Teel
at any time
that night

1513
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,501
have a gun
in his hand?

1514
01:42:57,546 --> 01:42:59,964
No.

1515
01:43:00,007 --> 01:43:03,176
Then how could
that last shot
have been fired?

1516
01:43:09,183 --> 01:43:10,391
Roger?

1517
01:43:10,475 --> 01:43:13,269
I was holding it.

1518
01:43:13,353 --> 01:43:16,856
Someone bumped
my shoulder, and
the gun went off.

1519
01:43:16,940 --> 01:43:20,401
[weeping]

1520
01:43:20,485 --> 01:43:22,486
I didn't mean
to kill anybody.

1521
01:43:22,571 --> 01:43:24,530
It was
an accident.

1522
01:43:29,077 --> 01:43:31,579
No further questions,
Your Honor.

1523
01:43:31,663 --> 01:43:33,539
(attorney)
lf this was
an accident,

1524
01:43:33,624 --> 01:43:35,166
why did you let
your father and brother

1525
01:43:35,250 --> 01:43:36,918
stand trial for
first-degree murder?

1526
01:43:37,002 --> 01:43:40,713
'Cause my
lawyers told me
not to say nothing.

1527
01:43:40,797 --> 01:43:42,673
Do you mean to
tell this jury

1528
01:43:42,758 --> 01:43:44,425
that you let
them sit in jail

1529
01:43:44,509 --> 01:43:46,928
without the privilege
of bond for three months,

1530
01:43:47,012 --> 01:43:49,347
and didn't tell anybody
that you shot this man

1531
01:43:49,389 --> 01:43:52,516
or that it
was an accident?

1532
01:43:52,601 --> 01:43:56,020
Your father and your
brother were on trial
for their lives!

1533
01:43:56,104 --> 01:43:57,730
For their lives!

1534
01:43:57,814 --> 01:43:59,732
And you
have not set foot
in this courtroom

1535
01:43:59,816 --> 01:44:01,692
until today!

1536
01:44:01,777 --> 01:44:03,986
My attorney
told me not
to come.

1537
01:44:07,324 --> 01:44:09,575
That boy lay
on the ground

1538
01:44:09,660 --> 01:44:15,122
begging for his life,
helpless, Roger.

1539
01:44:15,207 --> 01:44:16,624
Did you kick him?

1540
01:44:16,708 --> 01:44:19,293
We was all
kicking him.

1541
01:44:19,378 --> 01:44:20,878
And did
you beat him

1542
01:44:20,921 --> 01:44:22,713
with the stock
of that rifle, Roger?

1543
01:44:22,798 --> 01:44:25,132
His skull
was fractured.

1544
01:44:25,217 --> 01:44:26,509
Did you hit
him with it?

1545
01:44:30,764 --> 01:44:34,058
I refuse to answer on
the grounds that it
may incriminate me.

1546
01:44:34,101 --> 01:44:35,685
Who told you
to say that?

1547
01:44:35,769 --> 01:44:37,478
Who told you to plead
the Fifth Amendment?

1548
01:44:37,562 --> 01:44:40,982
My lawyers.
Mr. Watkins.

1549
01:44:43,443 --> 01:44:46,404
And did they tell
you that all the
witnesses had testified

1550
01:44:46,446 --> 01:44:49,031
that Larry
was holding
the gun?

1551
01:44:49,116 --> 01:44:51,242
And that if you said
that you shot the rifle

1552
01:44:51,326 --> 01:44:53,327
and that it
was an accident,

1553
01:44:53,412 --> 01:44:55,997
that your father
and brother might not
have to go to prison?

1554
01:44:58,000 --> 01:44:59,750
I refuse
to answer
on the--

1555
01:44:59,835 --> 01:45:03,421
Your brother
shot that boy,
didn't he, Roger?!

1556
01:45:03,463 --> 01:45:06,090
And you and your daddy
helped kill him,
didn't you?

1557
01:45:06,174 --> 01:45:09,302
They let you stay home
with your wife and
your baby.

1558
01:45:09,386 --> 01:45:10,803
Now you're supposed
to help them

1559
01:45:10,887 --> 01:45:12,763
and say that
you shot him

1560
01:45:12,848 --> 01:45:14,390
because they know there
isn't a witness anywhere

1561
01:45:14,474 --> 01:45:17,977
that can testify
to that effect.

1562
01:45:18,061 --> 01:45:20,104
Nobody but your wife
and your attorney,

1563
01:45:20,147 --> 01:45:22,315
and neither one of them
can testify against you.

1564
01:45:22,399 --> 01:45:30,531
But I'm sure they
told you that, too,
didn't they, Roger?

1565
01:45:30,615 --> 01:45:33,534
No further questions.

1566
01:45:33,618 --> 01:45:35,286
[hubbub of voices]

1567
01:45:35,370 --> 01:45:37,121
(female voices)
Lieutenant Williams,

1568
01:45:37,205 --> 01:45:38,831
why wasn't
the third
man indicted?

1569
01:45:38,915 --> 01:45:40,791
There was a
third party mentioned

1570
01:45:40,834 --> 01:45:43,169
from time to time
during the investigation,

1571
01:45:43,253 --> 01:45:45,546
but none of my witnesses
were able to make

1572
01:45:45,630 --> 01:45:47,965
a positive identification
of a third person,

and they all saw the
defendant, Larry Teel,
fire the fatal shot.

1574
01:46:01,480 --> 01:46:03,064
[clears throat]

1575
01:46:03,148 --> 01:46:07,735
Three men beat
Dickie Marrow

1576
01:46:07,819 --> 01:46:11,822
while he helplessly
begged for his life,

1577
01:46:11,907 --> 01:46:14,950
more than a hundred feet
off of their property.

1578
01:46:18,413 --> 01:46:23,334
First they shot him
as he was running away,

1579
01:46:23,418 --> 01:46:25,419
and then, when he was
flat on his back,

1580
01:46:25,504 --> 01:46:29,006
they beat him,
and they kicked him.

1581
01:46:29,091 --> 01:46:31,008
And they stomped him

1582
01:46:31,051 --> 01:46:34,011
and hit him
in the head
with a shotgun butt

1583
01:46:34,054 --> 01:46:36,722
over and over.

1584
01:46:36,807 --> 01:46:39,350
Then they put
a bullet in
his head,

1585
01:46:39,393 --> 01:46:42,269
just like you or I
would kill a snake,

1586
01:46:42,354 --> 01:46:47,900
and they called it
self-defense.

1587
01:46:47,984 --> 01:46:51,070
Then, after the state
proved beyond any doubt

1588
01:46:51,154 --> 01:46:52,613
that this killing

1589
01:46:52,697 --> 01:46:54,907
was by no stretch
of the imagination

1590
01:46:54,991 --> 01:46:56,742
an act of self-defense,

1591
01:46:56,827 --> 01:47:01,288
they came up
with a new story.

1592
01:47:01,373 --> 01:47:03,040
An accident.

1593
01:47:03,083 --> 01:47:05,543
Or what
they might call--

1594
01:47:05,585 --> 01:47:08,796
accidental self-defense.

1595
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:13,384
Of course, there is
no such category,
ladies and gentlemen,

1596
01:47:13,468 --> 01:47:17,054
and nothing remotely
like that happened.

1597
01:47:20,308 --> 01:47:24,061
This case is
one of the most
serious cases

1598
01:47:24,146 --> 01:47:26,021
ever to be tried
in this state.

1599
01:47:26,106 --> 01:47:29,775
And the outcome
will affect events
in this community,

01:47:29,860 --> 01:47:32,319
the state of
North Carolina,

1601

and across the nation.

1602
01:47:33,780 --> 01:47:35,906
We cannot tell the world

1603
01:47:35,949 --> 01:47:38,659
that we have one system
of justice for Negroes

1604
01:47:38,743 --> 01:47:40,953
and another for whites.

1605
01:47:41,037 --> 01:47:44,457
We must face the truth

1606
01:47:44,541 --> 01:47:46,792
and we must act upon it

1607
01:47:46,877 --> 01:47:49,420
or be damned
by our lies forever.

I--I hear that baby cry,

1612
01:48:05,604 --> 01:48:09,440
and I can't
help but think
about a little girl

1613
01:48:09,483 --> 01:48:11,442
going to have
to grow up now

1614
01:48:11,485 --> 01:48:15,821
without knowing
her father.

1615
01:48:15,906 --> 01:48:19,200
And I can't help
but hear that cry

1616
01:48:19,284 --> 01:48:21,202
as a cry from
Dickie Marrow,

1617
01:48:21,286 --> 01:48:25,206
saying, "Don't
let them kill me--

1618
01:48:25,290 --> 01:48:29,335
"and just tell the world
it was an accident.

1619

Please!--Don't let
them do that to me."

01:48:42,140 --> 01:48:44,558
because you
just as clearly
say to the world

1624
01:48:44,643 --> 01:48:49,813
that justice
is dead--in

I haven't really
thought about
it. Why?

There's been a killing
down in Louisiana.

a stoker down there.

01:55:37,513 --> 01:55:39,556
(Vernon)
Dick? What you
doing out here?

1732
01:55:39,641 --> 01:55:42,059
Hey, Vernon.

1733
01:55:42,101 --> 01:55:43,894
Vernon.

1734
01:55:46,564 --> 01:55:47,814
Gray.

1735
01:55:47,899 --> 01:55:49,066
C'mon in.

1736
01:55:49,150 --> 01:55:51,109
Close the
door, please.

1737
01:57:03,558 --> 01:57:07,436
That's a right good-size
hole you're digging
there, brethren.

1738
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:09,813
Yeah. We're digging
a hole big enough
so we can bury

1739
01:57:09,897 --> 01:57:11,440
every sorry sumbitch
in Oxford.

1740
01:57:18,698 --> 01:57:22,159
(man)
Well, that's the stupidest
damn thing l've ever heard of.

1741
01:57:22,243 --> 01:57:24,828
Who's going to be left
to cover us all up?

1742
01:57:24,871 --> 01:57:28,415
[laughs]
That's good.
That's real good.

1743
01:57:38,176 --> 01:57:39,885
(Vernon)
And they have sand
dunes in Wilmington.

1744
01:57:39,969 --> 01:57:41,595
White, white sand dunes.

1745
01:57:41,679 --> 01:57:43,722
Where it's the ocean
in the distance there.

1746
01:57:43,806 --> 01:57:45,348
And we're gonna run
over them sand dunes

1747
01:57:45,433 --> 01:57:47,392
and we're gonna
run in the water.

1748
01:57:47,477 --> 01:57:49,686
And we're gonna
just go crazy.
You in? You in?

1749
01:57:49,729 --> 01:57:52,481
You in? Yeah?

1750
01:57:58,404 --> 01:57:59,362
[sniffles]

1751
01:57:59,447 --> 01:58:04,743
[sigh]

1752
01:58:10,249 --> 01:58:12,000
[openly sobs]

1753
01:58:33,231 --> 01:58:36,066
Hey, $5 .00, please,
and can I borrow
that air gauge?

1754
01:58:36,150 --> 01:58:37,317
C'mon, pumpkin.

1755
01:58:37,401 --> 01:58:38,568
Thank you.

1756
01:58:48,913 --> 01:58:50,914
Daddy?

1757
01:58:50,998 --> 01:58:54,084
Did we get run
out of town?

1758
01:58:54,168 --> 01:58:56,962
Of course not.

1759
01:58:57,046 --> 01:58:59,005
We've been offered
a new church
in Wilmington.

1760
01:58:59,090 --> 01:59:01,591
It's a good church, too.

1761
01:59:01,634 --> 01:59:03,593
Some of the kids
at my school

1762
01:59:03,636 --> 01:59:06,429
said that you were
the reason that
everything happened.

1763
01:59:06,514 --> 01:59:10,225
They said their
parents are glad
that you're gone.

1764
01:59:10,309 --> 01:59:14,104
I imagine some of them'll
be crowing about now,
that's true.

1765
01:59:14,188 --> 01:59:16,773
But you know, the rooster
crows and the sun comes up

1766
01:59:16,816 --> 01:59:19,568
and that old rooster thinks
he done it all by himself.

1767
01:59:19,652 --> 01:59:22,154
But the Lord sees it
a little bit differently.

1768
01:59:27,410 --> 01:59:30,078
I did what I had
to do, little buck.

1769
01:59:32,123 --> 01:59:33,748
Let's go.

1770
01:59:49,098 --> 01:59:50,682
Everybody in the car.

1771
01:59:52,018 --> 01:59:55,270
We're on an adventure.

1772
01:59:58,524 --> 02:00:00,150
Thank you.

1773
02:00:20,296 --> 02:00:22,672
(male voice)
Did you ever hear
Golden Frinks?

1774
02:00:22,715 --> 02:00:26,551
Yeah, I heard
Golden Frinks
preach once.

1775
02:00:26,636 --> 02:00:28,220
Long time ago
at a funeral.

1776
02:00:30,973 --> 02:00:34,434
He flat
rang the bells
of heaven, too.

1777
02:00:34,518 --> 02:00:40,315
Who's Golden Frinks?

1778
02:00:45,613 --> 02:00:47,072
[soft music]

1779
02:07:24,720 --> 02:07:26,429

1780

1781
