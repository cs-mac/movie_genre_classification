I wanted to become
a professional boxer.

213
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:12,119
So, I went to sign up
for a boxing license.

They told me that the required age
is 1 8 but I was only 1 6.

he wanted me to retire.

328

I was 26 years old.

I thought I could still obtain
the chance to win a world title.

So, l fought those last six fights
without management.

I should've listened to Eddie

Maybe l wouldn't have Parkinson's.

Maybe l wouldn't have
trauma problems from being hit.

335
00:21:57,692 --> 00:22:00,860
And, but, the thing is,
it was my choice,

I just live life to its fullest.

for a fight at the MGM Grand.

342
00:22:23,384 --> 00:22:25,051
It was two weeks before the fight.

343
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:26,970
They went up and down the rankings,

344
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:29,556
and they couldn't find anybody
in the top five

It's like a 44-1 shot.

is the most feared

I think this guy just hit so hard,

that Ledwaba is totally
on the defensive.

360
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:08,720
He took this fight on
only two weeks notice,

361
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:12,265
only came here to America,
ten days ago,

362
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:15,935
and he is banging Ledwaba
right now.

363
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:18,646
And another, big right hand upstairs.

364

And now he's got Ledwaba
bleeding badly.

guys about how good Manny is,

374
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:47,842
and I say, "Watch him, he's going to
beat Ledwaba",

375
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:50,136
then people started believing in
Manny Pacquiao.

376
00:23:50,221 --> 00:23:52,013
So, we're in Texas.

377
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:54,766
And we had a really good
training camp over there.

378
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,268
At the weigh in, there's a pool table.

379
00:23:57,353 --> 00:24:00,647
So, Manny set up this shot,
it was six balls,

380
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:03,483
he's going to sink six balls
in one shot.

381
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:06,444
First try, they all went in.

382

out for the 1 2th round, Manny.

I don't care how proud he is.

386
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:18,623
There's no way a great fighter should
have to go through

387
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:19,833
3 more minutes of this.

Here comes Barrera's corner.

390

on the apron.

391

He's going to step into the ring.
That's a good decision.

392

two rounds ago.

Pacquiao tonight,

399

he himself is only
going to get 300 grand out of it.

400
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:54,576
So he deserves the chance
to make big money in the future.

changed my life also, because

406
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:10,508
l was content with him knocking
people out with the big left hand.

407
00:25:10,593 --> 00:25:12,760
But then we fought Morales.

Freddie Roach says,

409
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:16,598
"He's been too left hand dominant.

410
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:19,142
"To beat Morales, he'll have
to use his lead hand,

Morales very weary about
Pacquiao's left hand power.

00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,151
And I think it's clear right now

414
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:32,864
Manny Pacquiao isn't going to deck
Érik Morales with one big shot.

I said, "You know what,

418

"l can't be satisfied with
what l have here.

make him a more complete fighter."

on the right hand

until it's as good as the left."

422
00:25:54,762 --> 00:25:56,763
He had no idea what I was up to.

423
00:25:56,847 --> 00:26:00,141
Finally I said, "Manny, I'm just
working on getting you confidence,

424
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:01,684
in both hands."

425
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:04,145
And he just smiled at me
and, you know,

426
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,563
he just continued working,

427
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:08,233
and he knocked a guy out with
a hook for the first time,

428

ln some instances, less than half

Murad Muhammad
and his promotional company M & M

448
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:56,132
had entered into this secret agreement
with Pacquiao's managers.

449
00:27:57,301 --> 00:27:59,177
At the time, the Nazarios.

450
00:27:59,887 --> 00:28:03,598
He was funneling money
to a company.

451
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:06,642
Money that rightfully should've gone
to Manny Pacquiao, to the manager,

452
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:08,728
so you stop right there, and you say,

453
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:13,191
"Why is the promoter ever sharing
money with the manager?"

454
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:16,069
Especially without the fighter
knowing about it.

455
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:19,530
This is the Ali Act.

456

Manny Pacquiao's manager.

00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:39,258
which would've made it okay for him
to share money with them.

463
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:44,263
There's no central agency
regulating this.

464
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:50,353
What other sport do you have where
a guy every second of every round

465
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:52,855
is risking his life, literally.

466
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:55,400
Putting it all on the line
and why shouldn't he get

467
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:57,985
every cent that he's owed?

468

THOMAS: A promoter's job is to make
as much

469
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:14,419
money as the promoter can for himself.

470
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:18,714
A promoter wants to make money.
That's why they're in business.

471
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:23,219
But it's the fighter's job,

472
00:29:24,388 --> 00:29:27,515
to have the proper
business representatives

473
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,435
to negotiate with the promoter.

474
00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:39,610
Certainly Bob Arum has done
a wonderful job

475
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:45,032
of building Manny Pacquiao
as a commercial attraction.

476
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:47,702
But, no promoter is Mother Teresa.

477
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:50,204
Golden Boy certainly
isn't Mother Teresa.

Don King isn't, Lou DiBella isn't,
Bob Arum isn't.

l was spoiled
when l started promoting.

481
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,800
Because I started with Muhammad Ali.

482
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:07,305
As I spent more time
in the business,

483
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:11,267
I had attractions who
weren't Muhammad Ali.

484
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:16,439
And, therefore, I had to take
a larger role to bring attention

485
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:18,649
to the product that I was selling.

about promoters,

487
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:26,741
good, bad or indifferent,
I'm sure Bob himself has heard bad.

488

But they have an eye for talent.

489

Bob Arum has become and has remained
one of the major forces in the sport.

490

Longer than almost any promoter

best fighter he's ever had of all time

"l need ten copies of 24/7"?

517

Regardless of what Manny said,

on the scene in the mid 2000s.

525
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:17,560
Freddie introduced Michael to Manny.

526

Freddie has often said that it was
the biggest mistake of his life.

He would like to impose himself

that "l am next to Manny Pacquiao."

was fulfilling,

930
00:55:32,121 --> 00:55:36,833
but uniting people through twelve
rounds of fighting felt short-lived.

931
00:55:37,376 --> 00:55:40,712
Manny's journey would soon take
another direction.

932
00:55:44,258 --> 00:55:48,052
My dream is to focus as a politician.

933
00:55:48,846 --> 00:55:52,849
Lot of politicians is corrupt so,
I don't want to be like them.

MANNY: Mr. Speaker,
my dear colleagues,

937
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:05,528
ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon!

938
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:07,447
The victory over Margarito

939
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:10,992
the eighth championship belt
in the different weight division

940
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:12,744
is not mine alone.

941
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:16,664
It belongs to every Filipino.

942
00:56:16,999 --> 00:56:20,626
The Filipino people have shown
once more to the world

943
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:24,630
that the Filipinos can excel
in a world-class arena.

944
00:56:24,715 --> 00:56:30,470
Because of hard-work, dedication
and faith in God Almighty.

As your colleague,

946
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:35,308
let me thank our President,
His Excellency, Benigno Aquino

947
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:37,769
because of his promise
that he will help

948
00:56:37,853 --> 00:56:39,854
the province of Sarangani

949
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:42,815

950
00:56:45,778 --> 00:56:49,155
FRANKLlN: One ofthe promises of Manny
as a Congressman

951
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:52,700
is the promise to people
to give them a hospital.

952
00:56:52,785 --> 00:56:54,994
The promise has been there
for some time,

953

and we don't have a public hospital.

954
00:56:56,872 --> 00:57:00,249
So this is a promise that was
made to the people,

Manny Pacquiao.

And then, you've got
your people of Sarangani.

What priority are you gonna give them?

-But have l been beaten?

because he has never been beaten.

And he's that good.

987

l don't think it's a no-brainer that
Manny goes there and beats him.

last fight, and then retire.

There's nowhere else to go.

Why go any further than that?

He's a throwback.

when people fought the very best.

what boxing fans have always wanted
Floyd to do.

Just out of the blue?

you was fighting at 1 05 pounds?

Once again, Bob Arum is

about my fighter.

When it's time, it's time.

1187
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:27,347
You know, the thing is,
l went overboard

1188
01:10:27,432 --> 01:10:28,932
and l pay for that now.

1189
01:10:29,017 --> 01:10:32,769
So the thing is, when it's time,
l will tell Manny,

1190
01:10:32,854 --> 01:10:34,813
and he will...

1191
01:10:34,898 --> 01:10:38,609
l'm almost 99% sure
he will listen to me,

1192
01:10:38,693 --> 01:10:40,861
because we have great rapport
with each other,

1193
01:10:40,945 --> 01:10:43,196
and he knows l'm an honest person,

1194
01:10:43,281 --> 01:10:46,241
and l would never tell him
something that wasn't true.

1195
01:10:46,326 --> 01:10:49,745
So, if l see him slowing down
or slipping,

1196
01:10:49,871 --> 01:10:52,372
the first time l see that,
l'll say it's over.

1197
01:10:52,457 --> 01:10:55,083
Well, in his talks with me,

1198
01:10:55,168 --> 01:11:01,173
he's given me a date in 201 3,
where he's gonna hang it up.

1199
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:04,468
And so l expect that
after this Bradley fight,

1200
01:11:04,552 --> 01:11:07,387
that he'll probably have about three
more fights,

1201
01:11:07,472 --> 01:11:09,222
and that'll be the end.

next biggest thing in boxing, and...

boxing, I'll still be with Manny.

As long as he wants me to be around,
I'll be there.

in the Philippines,

01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:42,673
even when he's not boxing.

1211
01:11:42,799 --> 01:11:45,384
What I want
and what I am striving for is

1212
01:11:45,468 --> 01:11:48,011
I want to be in a position

1213

to supplement Manny's income
so he can sustain the same lifestyle,

1214
01:11:51,849 --> 01:11:55,477
after we're not making 60, 70 million
dollars from boxing a year.

1215
01:11:56,270 --> 01:11:58,522
For him and his family.

you know what I mean?

1217
01:12:00,775 --> 01:12:03,443

being used,

1218

and do his own thing.

1219

And do what he feels that he wants
to do.

1220

and focusing on his political career
