1
00:02:55,329 --> 00:02:58,623
Madam, your son told me
he is bringing a guest.

2
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:02,127
- A guest?
- Yes. A girl ...

3
00:03:16,726 --> 00:03:18,977
So, we have Gratieni
and his wife here,

4
00:03:21,063 --> 00:03:22,230
Betta and Gregorio ―

5
00:03:25,484 --> 00:03:27,194
probably ... here.

6
00:03:28,362 --> 00:03:31,698
- Between Edo and Delfina.
- Yes.

7
00:03:31,866 --> 00:03:34,993
She should sit next to Edoardo.

8
00:03:35,161 --> 00:03:37,245
She doesn't know anyone.

9
00:03:42,793 --> 00:03:45,503
- Is Edo back?
- Not yet.

10
00:03:48,132 --> 00:03:50,967
- Any news on the race?
- He came in second.

11
00:03:51,135 --> 00:03:52,636
Second?

12
00:03:52,803 --> 00:03:56,264
The snow, Grandpa's birthday,
Edo losing a race ...

13
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,809
Three events in just one day!

14
00:04:06,234 --> 00:04:08,985
Maybe this year we'll 
be spared Edo's dish.

15
00:04:09,153 --> 00:04:11,196
What do you say, Betta?

16
00:04:11,364 --> 00:04:13,865
Your sister's in a bad mood today.

17
00:04:14,909 --> 00:04:18,495
- What's for breakfast?
- Thanks, Ida.

18
00:04:31,008 --> 00:04:35,345
He's never this late.
He must really like this girl!

19
00:04:35,513 --> 00:04:37,472
Hi, Anita.

20
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,850
- Good morning, Ida.
- Good morning, Edoardo.

21
00:04:41,018 --> 00:04:43,812
- Good morning, Liliana.
- Good morning, Mr. Edoardo.

22
00:04:55,366 --> 00:04:58,618
Here you are, my love.

23
00:04:58,786 --> 00:05:03,081
- Thanks for the soup, Mama.
- I have to add some saffron.

24
00:05:03,249 --> 00:05:05,583
- Who is she?
- Be nice to her, she's really shy.

25
00:05:05,751 --> 00:05:08,753
Her name is Eva.

26
00:05:08,921 --> 00:05:11,089
Ida is a little jealous.

27
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:41,202
Edo lost the race today.

28
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:44,205
He'll have more time
to concentrate on work.

29
00:05:44,373 --> 00:05:46,791
Good morning, Madam.
Good morning, Sir.

30
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:50,503
- How are you, Ida?
- Very well, thank you. And you?

31
00:05:50,671 --> 00:05:53,340
- You look well.
- Thank you.

32
00:05:56,344 --> 00:05:58,386
Happy birthday.

33
00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:03,183
- Good morning.
- How are you?

34
00:06:03,351 --> 00:06:06,186
Very well, Madam.
And you?

35
00:06:06,354 --> 00:06:08,772
We've been through happier times.

36
00:06:16,781 --> 00:06:19,032
Look how they've grown.

37
00:06:22,495 --> 00:06:24,329
Grandpa!

38
00:06:24,497 --> 00:06:27,457
Elisabetta, how are you?

39
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:28,792
Fine.

40
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:31,461
- Nothing for me?
- Happy birthday, Grandpa.

41
00:06:38,094 --> 00:06:40,095
They are here.

42
00:07:02,284 --> 00:07:03,952
When did you get back?

43
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,745
I was a little late.

44
00:07:05,913 --> 00:07:07,831
Who did you lose to today?
Gregorio?

45
00:07:07,998 --> 00:07:11,835
No, to a guy I don't know.
I didn't lose, we tied.

46
00:07:12,002 --> 00:07:16,172
Why didn't you challenge
the judge's ruling?

47
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,633
He deserved the victory.

48
00:07:21,011 --> 00:07:24,889
I spoke to your brother this morning.
It's a pity you weren't there.

49
00:07:29,937 --> 00:07:32,689
Your grandfather's in an 
excellent mood today.

50
00:07:32,857 --> 00:07:36,151
- Is this Eva from the Ugolini family?
- Yes, the poor side.

51
00:07:36,318 --> 00:07:40,613
Gianluca, you're even more 
of a snob than your father.

52
00:07:40,781 --> 00:07:42,907
More than your grandmother!

53
00:07:44,034 --> 00:07:45,493
Hello, Grandpa. Happy birthday.

54
00:07:49,206 --> 00:07:51,249
It surprises me ...

55
00:07:51,417 --> 00:07:56,254
that Tancredi gave it to 
Emma as a wedding gift.

56
00:07:58,507 --> 00:08:02,844
Tell me, how did you manage
to lose today's race?

57
00:08:03,012 --> 00:08:07,682
It was fixed. They wanted 
him out of the running.

58
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:10,226
I don't think so ...

59
00:08:10,394 --> 00:08:12,520
- I was up against someone stronger.
- Impossible!

60
00:08:12,688 --> 00:08:14,814
- The Recchis are unbeatable.
- That's right.

61
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:24,869
The doctor said we shouldn't worry.

62
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:27,663
He is fighting with all his strength ...

63
00:08:27,831 --> 00:08:30,625
and his heart is responding well.

64
00:08:36,006 --> 00:08:38,049
He has decided.

65
00:08:42,304 --> 00:08:44,931
I'm glad you lost the race.

66
00:08:46,433 --> 00:08:50,436
From now on you won't have
any further distractions.

67
00:08:50,604 --> 00:08:53,231
I want to go to London
to see Herzog and De Meuron.

68
00:08:53,398 --> 00:08:56,192
- Who?
- They designed the new Tate Gallery.

69
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,194
The Tate Gallery?

70
00:08:58,362 --> 00:09:00,863
I want to give them the scaffolding
covers for the next project.

71
00:09:01,031 --> 00:09:05,076
- It'd guarantee years of work.
- Are you sure?

72
00:09:43,949 --> 00:09:46,450
- Madam, you look beautiful.
- Thank you.

73
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,839
- How are we doing here?
- Well.

74
00:10:55,062 --> 00:10:57,521
Is everything all right?

75
00:11:01,943 --> 00:11:06,739
Betta, Eva works in Atellani's,
the bookshop on Corso Magenta.

76
00:11:06,907 --> 00:11:10,117
The one below Grandpa's house?
I've never seen you there.

77
00:11:10,285 --> 00:11:14,080
I've not been there long.
I'm in the art department.

78
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,800
- Where is Pierluigi?
- He's coming.

79
00:11:30,347 --> 00:11:31,764
Thank you.

80
00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:46,779
Not Edo's ukha dish again!
Enough!

81
00:11:47,781 --> 00:11:51,200
No, it's fabulous! "Ton sur ton."

82
00:11:51,368 --> 00:11:52,993
You're right, Andrea.

83
00:11:53,161 --> 00:11:56,997
"Ton sur ton"
is better than "con sur con"!

84
00:12:00,168 --> 00:12:04,171
Eva, how did the race go?
You were there, right?

85
00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:06,924
The guy who beat Edo is a chef.

86
00:12:07,092 --> 00:12:09,176
- Do you know him?
- No.

87
00:12:09,344 --> 00:12:11,846
But his restaurant is in a 
building owned by my family.

88
00:12:12,973 --> 00:12:16,517
- Beaten by a chef?
- It wasn't fair.

89
00:12:16,685 --> 00:12:19,645
- Edo won.
- If you say so ...

90
00:14:15,595 --> 00:14:17,012
Shall we go?

91
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,934
- Can I see it?
- Together with the others.

92
00:14:22,102 --> 00:14:23,435
Thanks.

93
00:14:26,273 --> 00:14:27,565
Let's go.

94
00:14:43,999 --> 00:14:47,418
May I have your attention?

95
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:52,089
I have all of my granddaughter's
drawings on a wall.

96
00:14:52,257 --> 00:14:57,011
When she becomes a famous painter,
I'll have people pay to see them.

97
00:15:10,483 --> 00:15:12,192
What is this?

98
00:15:14,321 --> 00:15:17,781
I took it at the Hanbury Gardens.
You took me there.

99
00:15:19,075 --> 00:15:21,410
I want to move into photography now.

100
00:15:24,122 --> 00:15:25,998
I like it. It's beautiful.

101
00:15:28,001 --> 00:15:31,962
Yes, I like it too.

102
00:15:33,673 --> 00:15:36,342
I'm just thrown by novelties.

103
00:15:36,509 --> 00:15:39,178
I don't think he likes it.

104
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:44,308
You still owe me a drawing.

105
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:46,226
Come here.

106
00:15:51,858 --> 00:15:53,734
I like it. It's wonderful.

107
00:15:53,902 --> 00:15:56,695
Really.

108
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:24,640
Thank you.

109
00:16:27,185 --> 00:16:28,686
For you.

110
00:16:31,189 --> 00:16:32,815
Thank you.

111
00:16:45,578 --> 00:16:47,579
My dear friends,

112
00:16:48,623 --> 00:16:50,416
I don't want to die ...

113
00:16:53,378 --> 00:16:54,503
and I won't ...

114
00:16:55,755 --> 00:16:58,590
as long as the business
carries on ...

115
00:16:58,758 --> 00:17:01,135
in the same spirit ...

116
00:17:01,302 --> 00:17:05,139
in which I created it.

117
00:17:09,019 --> 00:17:13,355
Our family's fortune
is built on the factory.

118
00:17:13,523 --> 00:17:16,817
Every brick, every man,

119
00:17:16,985 --> 00:17:19,153
every piece of material ...

120
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:22,322
is living proof ...

121
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:26,368
of what we have been.

122
00:17:26,536 --> 00:17:31,331
We engraved our name
in our country's history ...

123
00:17:31,499 --> 00:17:34,585
when, both during 
the war and after,

124
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:37,629
we were able to tend to its needs ...

125
00:17:37,797 --> 00:17:41,800
with our factory's constant,
busy activity.

126
00:17:42,802 --> 00:17:47,347
The company was born Recchi,
and Recchi it must remain forever.

127
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,438
The time has come ...

128
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:58,317
for me to retire ...

129
00:17:58,485 --> 00:18:01,987
and name my successor.

130
00:18:07,368 --> 00:18:10,370
My son has always lived up ...

131
00:18:10,538 --> 00:18:12,873
to my expectations.

132
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:16,543
I knew he would from the moment
I first held him in my arms.

133
00:18:18,213 --> 00:18:20,214
Thank you, Tancredi,

134
00:18:20,381 --> 00:18:23,258
for having been the 
son I always wanted ...

135
00:18:23,426 --> 00:18:27,930
and for having created
such a marvelous family.

136
00:18:29,516 --> 00:18:33,102
I see qualities in your children ...

137
00:18:33,269 --> 00:18:37,147
that will lead them
to live intense ...

138
00:18:37,315 --> 00:18:40,943
and fruitful lives, as I have.

139
00:18:42,737 --> 00:18:45,948
Of course, my grandson
had to choose this day ...

140
00:18:46,116 --> 00:18:50,494
of all days to interrupt our 
family's athletic tradition!

141
00:19:00,797 --> 00:19:03,006
Therefore ...

142
00:19:06,344 --> 00:19:08,971
I have decided to leave ...

143
00:19:11,558 --> 00:19:14,393
everything in your hands, Tancredi.

144
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:27,239
And in your son Edoardo's.

145
00:19:36,249 --> 00:19:39,918
It will take two men
to replace me!

146
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:47,301
Here's to Tancredi and Edoardo!

147
00:19:47,468 --> 00:19:49,344
To the Recchis!

148
00:19:55,602 --> 00:19:57,311
Come here, you winner!

149
00:20:03,443 --> 00:20:05,235
Go to the cellar.

150
00:20:05,403 --> 00:20:07,905
Bring two bottles of '49.

151
00:20:25,965 --> 00:20:28,175
Yes?

152
00:20:28,343 --> 00:20:31,136
It's for Edoardo Recchi.

153
00:20:31,304 --> 00:20:34,014
- Can I take it?
- I'd prefer to deliver it myself.

154
00:20:34,182 --> 00:20:36,391
- Who are you?
- Antonio Biscaglia.

155
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,393
One moment.

156
00:20:43,024 --> 00:20:44,483
This way.

157
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:49,196
Follow the path. It'll take you
to the entrance of the villa.

158
00:21:17,725 --> 00:21:19,810
Ida, leave it.

159
00:21:26,484 --> 00:21:28,235
What are you doing here?

160
00:21:29,654 --> 00:21:33,198
That's the chef ―
the one who beat Edo.

161
00:21:33,366 --> 00:21:34,992
Come in!

162
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:40,664
I wanted to bring you a gift.

163
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:43,333
A gift?

164
00:21:43,501 --> 00:21:46,878
For me? I get it. You're no longer
certain of your victory today.

165
00:21:47,046 --> 00:21:50,632
- You put up a good fight.
- Come in.

166
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,301
It's a special night for my family.

167
00:21:52,468 --> 00:21:56,555
I'd rather not, thanks.

168
00:21:56,723 --> 00:21:57,764
As you wish.

169
00:21:57,932 --> 00:22:02,477
I made you a cake.
I'm a chef.

170
00:22:04,731 --> 00:22:06,606
Mama!

171
00:22:06,774 --> 00:22:09,484
I want to show you something.

172
00:22:13,364 --> 00:22:16,950
- This is Antonio.
- Good evening.

173
00:22:17,118 --> 00:22:18,994
Look what he made for me.

174
00:22:19,996 --> 00:22:22,247
Isn't it a work of art? He made it.

175
00:22:22,415 --> 00:22:25,876
He's the guy that beat me today.
That's why he doesn't want to stay.

176
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:29,379
- Please stay.
- It doesn't matter, thanks.

177
00:22:30,381 --> 00:22:32,966
- Are you going to bed, Mama?
- Yes, my love.

178
00:22:41,601 --> 00:22:43,101
Ida!

179
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:49,483
I have to take this bottle
to Grandpa ― don't let him leave!

180
00:22:51,652 --> 00:22:54,154
- Should the cake go in the fridge?
- No.

181
00:22:54,322 --> 00:22:56,073
Please, come in.

182
00:23:38,783 --> 00:23:42,369
SOME MONTHS LATER

183
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:16,528
Good morning, Madam.

184
00:24:16,696 --> 00:24:19,656
- How is your son, Edo?
- Fine, thank you.

185
00:24:19,824 --> 00:24:22,701
- Just the blazer?
- Yes, only the blazer.

186
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:34,296
I've managed to get rid
of those nasty stains.

187
00:24:34,464 --> 00:24:36,131
- It's fine.
- Yes.

188
00:24:44,765 --> 00:24:46,516
This is for you.

189
00:24:46,684 --> 00:24:50,770
Wait, Mrs. Recchi, I found this.

190
00:24:52,315 --> 00:24:56,693
I saved it from the washing machine.
I made it just in time.

191
00:24:56,861 --> 00:24:59,571
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

192
00:25:20,304 --> 00:25:23,848
Being part of a couple is 
as nice as being alone.

193
00:25:24,016 --> 00:25:26,184
We need to be brave.

194
00:25:27,228 --> 00:25:30,480
They are the words of a song
that a friend made me listen to.

195
00:25:30,648 --> 00:25:33,858
She's the one in the photo.
Her name is Angaharad.

196
00:25:36,362 --> 00:25:41,157
Edo, you're the only one
who loves me how I am.

197
00:25:43,369 --> 00:25:45,620
I have been with a girl.

198
00:25:51,752 --> 00:25:55,880
Gregorio keeps on phoning.
He pretends not to understand.

199
00:25:56,048 --> 00:25:57,757
Maybe he doesn't understand.

200
00:26:01,762 --> 00:26:06,266
I don't know if I'll see her again,
it was very beautiful.

201
00:26:07,643 --> 00:26:10,979
But I'm in love with another girl.
I love Angaharad.

202
00:26:14,858 --> 00:26:18,278
I don't know what she thinks 
of me, or if she likes girls.

203
00:26:18,445 --> 00:26:22,073
Does it matter?
Today I managed to make her laugh.

204
00:27:00,738 --> 00:27:02,196
Antonio!

205
00:27:05,284 --> 00:27:06,826
Antonio?

206
00:27:07,828 --> 00:27:10,413
- Hi, Tom!
- You finally made it!

207
00:27:18,505 --> 00:27:21,049
You told me there 
were spectacular views,

208
00:27:22,718 --> 00:27:24,719
but I can't see anything!

209
00:27:48,786 --> 00:27:52,789
You're right, it's lovely here.

210
00:27:53,916 --> 00:27:56,959
- Isn't it a bit too remote?
- Two hours by car.

211
00:27:58,003 --> 00:27:59,587
You're right.

212
00:28:04,551 --> 00:28:06,719
I'm having a party at my house,

213
00:28:06,887 --> 00:28:08,763
for Eva's birthday.

214
00:28:08,931 --> 00:28:11,182
I want to ask her to marry me.

215
00:28:14,895 --> 00:28:17,897
Don't you have anything to say?

216
00:28:18,065 --> 00:28:21,526
- Congratulations.
- A little enthusiasm would be good!

217
00:28:21,694 --> 00:28:24,404
Honestly, I'm happy.
Let's drink to it.

218
00:28:26,073 --> 00:28:27,907
Best wishes!

219
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:36,916
Try this.

220
00:28:37,084 --> 00:28:39,711
It's eggplant and elderflower,

221
00:28:39,878 --> 00:28:42,422
I extracted the essence from here.

222
00:28:42,589 --> 00:28:45,550
If I did this at the restaurant,
my father'd be mad.

223
00:28:45,718 --> 00:28:48,094
He doesn't understand what I do.

224
00:28:48,262 --> 00:28:51,180
He just thinks of the money.

225
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,061
Imagine a restaurant here.

226
00:28:57,229 --> 00:28:59,814
People would have to climb 
up to try my dishes.

227
00:28:59,982 --> 00:29:02,775
The essence of flavors.
As simple as this place.

228
00:29:02,943 --> 00:29:04,068
Do it.

229
00:29:04,236 --> 00:29:07,780
- This is all his, he'd never let me.
- Have you asked him?

230
00:29:08,907 --> 00:29:12,326
He thinks it's madness,
biting off more than I can chew.

231
00:29:12,494 --> 00:29:14,412
He says nobody would come.

232
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:18,583
- I'll convince him.
- It's not that easy.

233
00:29:20,169 --> 00:29:24,172
Come on, give me a hand.
You've become a real wimp.

234
00:29:24,339 --> 00:29:26,924
Did you invite me here to work?

235
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,650
- Oh, how are you today?
- Doing well, thank you!

236
00:29:58,373 --> 00:30:00,792
- Good morning! How are you?
- Fine, Rachele.

237
00:30:00,959 --> 00:30:05,671
- I'm so glad you've stayed with us.
- Me too, Madam.

238
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:09,300
She is in a terrible mood,
despite having won the lottery.

239
00:30:09,468 --> 00:30:12,345
Four straight numbers ...
I should've listened to her!

240
00:30:12,513 --> 00:30:15,097
- You too?
- I keep her company.

241
00:30:16,725 --> 00:30:20,102
As if coming to my husband's 
funeral wasn't enough for her.

242
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:23,731
She wrote that she shares my 
sorrow over Edoardo's death.

243
00:30:23,899 --> 00:30:27,735
Shares what?
My husband was mine alone,

244
00:30:27,903 --> 00:30:30,905
and anything that happened
without me is of no importance!

245
00:30:31,073 --> 00:30:33,825
- Emma!
- Andrea!

246
00:30:36,036 --> 00:30:38,621
She's in a terrible rage!
I have to go.

247
00:30:38,789 --> 00:30:41,916
- Conference call with your husband.
- Goodbye.

248
00:30:44,586 --> 00:30:46,671
Thanks, Emma.

249
00:30:46,839 --> 00:30:49,882
Tancredi called me
from London yesterday.

250
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:52,718
He is making important decisions.

251
00:30:53,804 --> 00:30:56,639
It was like listening to his father.

252
00:30:56,807 --> 00:30:59,225
He gets more like him every day.

253
00:31:01,186 --> 00:31:03,145
Elisabetta?

254
00:31:03,313 --> 00:31:07,859
She never calls. What is she up to?

255
00:31:08,026 --> 00:31:10,987
She likes the school she has chosen.

256
00:31:12,322 --> 00:31:14,532
She's very busy studying.

257
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:19,161
- She wanted to come back today ...
- Do you like her?

258
00:31:19,329 --> 00:31:20,538
Sorry?

259
00:31:20,706 --> 00:31:23,499
Edo's girlfriend, the Ugolini girl.

260
00:31:23,667 --> 00:31:26,586
Eva? She's very nice.

261
00:31:26,753 --> 00:31:29,922
He seems happy with her.

262
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:33,050
I wouldn't be surprised ...

263
00:31:33,218 --> 00:31:36,137
if they made an 
important announcement soon.

264
00:31:36,305 --> 00:31:39,682
The perfect wedding for 
her and her family.

265
00:31:41,852 --> 00:31:46,314
Marriage: Number 36 on the Lotto.

266
00:31:46,481 --> 00:31:47,940
That should be lucky!

267
00:31:53,363 --> 00:31:56,574
Let's carry on the family tradition.

268
00:31:56,742 --> 00:31:57,909
Give it to her from me.

269
00:31:58,076 --> 00:31:59,619
Thank you.

270
00:32:28,273 --> 00:32:30,566
Ida, it's bustling!

271
00:32:30,734 --> 00:32:34,445
We're almost done, Madam.
The chef's been cooking for two hours.

272
00:33:07,896 --> 00:33:09,105
Mama!

273
00:33:10,774 --> 00:33:12,525
Why are you here?

274
00:33:14,111 --> 00:33:17,321
Remember Antonio?
You met on Grandpa's birthday.

275
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:20,241
Yes.

276
00:33:25,998 --> 00:33:27,873
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Madam.

277
00:33:28,041 --> 00:33:29,709
Excuse me.

278
00:33:31,003 --> 00:33:34,296
Since I tried his cooking,
I fell in love with him.

279
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:36,841
Did you prepare all 
this on your own?

280
00:33:37,009 --> 00:33:38,801
No, Franco helped me.

281
00:33:40,262 --> 00:33:42,013
Russian salad ...

282
00:33:44,182 --> 00:33:47,768
- Why don't you try?
- I don't know how ...

283
00:33:47,936 --> 00:33:52,273
- She's a great cook. Go on, Mama!
- Give it a go. It's not difficult.

284
00:33:57,154 --> 00:33:59,864
- It looks dangerous.
- It isn't.

285
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:03,409
Be brave.

286
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,954
I'll help you.

287
00:34:10,417 --> 00:34:13,794
- Hi, Franco.
- Good evening.

288
00:34:25,015 --> 00:34:27,767
- Perfect, isn't it?
- Perfect!

289
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:24,406
Mama ...

290
00:35:24,574 --> 00:35:26,575
Were you sleeping?

291
00:35:31,706 --> 00:35:33,457
Good idea.

292
00:35:33,625 --> 00:35:35,543
You won't get any peace tonight.

293
00:35:43,301 --> 00:35:45,845
Do you miss Russia?

294
00:35:46,012 --> 00:35:47,596
Sometimes.

295
00:35:54,271 --> 00:35:56,647
You know ...

296
00:35:56,815 --> 00:35:59,525
great things are happening there.

297
00:35:59,693 --> 00:36:01,819
Sweetheart ...

298
00:36:01,987 --> 00:36:04,029
Bye.

299
00:37:22,692 --> 00:37:25,986
- How is the party going?
- Very well, Madam.

300
00:37:31,076 --> 00:37:33,118
Are you tired, Ida?

301
00:37:34,371 --> 00:37:38,457
No, we've had tougher ones.
Anyway, Edo is so happy.

302
00:37:39,584 --> 00:37:43,671
Please sit with me.
Tell me what's going on.

303
00:37:43,838 --> 00:37:45,965
Edo has spent all evening with Eva.

304
00:37:46,132 --> 00:37:48,592
He left her only to try and take ...

305
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,178
his chef friend away 
from the kitchen.

306
00:37:51,346 --> 00:37:53,222
He thinks very highly of him.

307
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:56,183
Luckily, Mr. Tancredi is in London.

308
00:37:56,351 --> 00:38:00,271
He doesn't really like 
evenings like these.

309
00:38:24,296 --> 00:38:26,588
- Shall I close the curtains?
- Yes, thanks.

310
00:38:40,687 --> 00:38:43,605
Did you see the wonderful dish
your son's friend sent you?

311
00:38:54,534 --> 00:38:57,369
The party cost more 
than we'd agreed.

312
00:38:57,537 --> 00:39:00,414
It was a lovely evening.

313
00:39:00,582 --> 00:39:02,541
Edo was so happy.

314
00:39:02,709 --> 00:39:04,835
A shame you weren't there.

315
00:39:05,003 --> 00:39:07,463
Do you think he wants to marry her?

316
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:11,467
Your mother is convinced.

317
00:39:11,634 --> 00:39:13,510
Elisabetta thinks so too.

318
00:39:15,096 --> 00:39:17,097
How is Betta?

319
00:39:17,265 --> 00:39:20,100
I thought she looked well;
maybe a bit sad.

320
00:39:20,268 --> 00:39:22,519
I think she wants to 
get back with Gregorio.

321
00:39:22,687 --> 00:39:25,689
She told me you're 
picking her up tomorrow.

322
00:39:25,857 --> 00:39:28,400
Yes, after lunch with Rori.

323
00:39:28,568 --> 00:39:32,696
I have to admit I was wrong. Going to
London was the right thing for her.

324
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:36,408
She likes it there.
She seems more motivated.

325
00:39:38,244 --> 00:39:41,872
I don't think she will 
go back to Gregorio.

326
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,375
She doesn't love him.

327
00:39:44,542 --> 00:39:45,834
Ida?

328
00:39:48,004 --> 00:39:49,922
Here.

329
00:39:51,758 --> 00:39:53,801
What does that mean?

330
00:39:58,681 --> 00:40:01,183
What does Edo think of selling?

331
00:40:01,351 --> 00:40:04,019
He is slowly coming 
to terms with it.

332
00:40:04,187 --> 00:40:06,939
He can't remain anchored 
to the past.

333
00:40:07,107 --> 00:40:10,734
Gianluca thinks that selling
is the only sensible option.

334
00:40:10,902 --> 00:40:14,238
And what do you think
about his restaurant idea?

335
00:40:14,406 --> 00:40:15,781
It's his money!

336
00:40:19,327 --> 00:40:22,788
You know what I think
about my father's decision?

337
00:40:22,956 --> 00:40:25,332
Edo isn't at all ready ...

338
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,085
to make decisions
about the company.

339
00:40:28,253 --> 00:40:31,463
He still needs a lot of guidance.

340
00:40:41,266 --> 00:40:44,726
Edoardo's mother has confirmed
three people for one o'clock.

341
00:40:44,894 --> 00:40:46,603
Yes, I know.

342
00:40:46,771 --> 00:40:48,730
- What's she like?
- Who?

343
00:40:48,898 --> 00:40:51,567
Mrs. Recchi.
Is she a nice person?

344
00:40:52,902 --> 00:40:54,611
She's nice.

345
00:40:57,615 --> 00:40:59,408
Can I have the press?

346
00:41:01,911 --> 00:41:03,036
Thanks.

347
00:41:16,634 --> 00:41:19,344
What are you charging 
Edo for the party?

348
00:41:19,512 --> 00:41:21,930
It was my gift to him.

349
00:41:28,438 --> 00:41:32,524
Leghorn-style cod.
This goes onto the menu.

350
00:41:32,692 --> 00:41:34,526
We did it!

351
00:41:42,788 --> 00:41:47,459
1995 Bergheim Riesling Altenberg.

352
00:41:47,627 --> 00:41:49,211
Excellent.

353
00:41:50,379 --> 00:41:53,965
The first time my 
son mentioned Emma ...

354
00:41:54,133 --> 00:41:56,927
was when we were at La Scala,
on St. Ambrose's feast day.

355
00:41:57,094 --> 00:41:59,262
You were still in Russia.

356
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:04,017
Tancredi said, "Mama, I'm marrying
a woman more beautiful than you."

357
00:42:04,185 --> 00:42:06,478
Naturally, I didn't believe him.

358
00:42:10,525 --> 00:42:12,609
To the Recchi wives!

359
00:42:18,991 --> 00:42:21,535
Coming here today 
was a great idea.

360
00:42:21,702 --> 00:42:24,788
Edo is right to believe
in his friend.

361
00:42:24,956 --> 00:42:26,581
He's a real talent.

362
00:42:26,749 --> 00:42:28,500
I'm worried they're 
pushing it a bit.

363
00:42:30,461 --> 00:42:33,838
The idea of the restaurant
was rather rushed.

364
00:42:34,006 --> 00:42:38,468
Too much enthusiasm can cause 
one not to think straight.

365
00:42:38,636 --> 00:42:41,596
Edoardo is an intelligent man.

366
00:42:41,764 --> 00:42:43,598
He knows what he's doing.

367
00:42:44,892 --> 00:42:48,895
Marinated egg yolk, pea cream
and zucchini flowers;

368
00:42:49,063 --> 00:42:53,733
prawns with ratatouille
and sweet-and-sour sauce;

369
00:42:53,901 --> 00:42:56,152
and mixed fish with 
crunchy vegetables.

370
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,238
Enjoy your meal.

371
00:43:02,493 --> 00:43:04,911
Where would you like to live?

372
00:43:05,079 --> 00:43:07,497
I wouldn't mind London.

373
00:43:07,665 --> 00:43:11,167
I know a law firm where 
I could be an apprentice.

374
00:43:11,335 --> 00:43:13,336
I love the city ...

375
00:44:02,053 --> 00:44:04,054
Welcome, ladies.

376
00:44:04,221 --> 00:44:07,724
Antonio, this is Edo's grandmother.
You already know Emma.

377
00:44:07,892 --> 00:44:11,019
- How do you do?
- An excellent meal.

378
00:44:11,187 --> 00:44:14,105
I heard of your project
with my grandson.

379
00:44:14,273 --> 00:44:17,942
I'd be happy to give my opinion
regarding the furnishing.

380
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:21,029
Thank you.
And thanks for coming.

381
00:44:27,536 --> 00:44:30,246
They seemed happy.

382
00:44:30,414 --> 00:44:32,791
I think so.

383
00:44:32,958 --> 00:44:35,210
I made prawns for your mother.

384
00:44:39,882 --> 00:44:42,884
I know my father
only listens to you,

385
00:44:43,052 --> 00:44:44,969
but I'll try and tell him.

386
00:44:50,101 --> 00:44:52,185
Rori, excuse me a moment.

387
00:44:58,859 --> 00:45:01,277
Am I interrupting?

388
00:45:01,445 --> 00:45:05,281
- I'd like to thank you. 
You are great. │- Thanks.

389
00:45:05,449 --> 00:45:08,368
The risotto, the prawns,
the vegetables ...

390
00:45:08,536 --> 00:45:10,120
they were exquisite.

391
00:45:10,287 --> 00:45:13,081
- I grow the vegetables myself.
- Really? Where?

392
00:45:13,249 --> 00:45:15,709
Near Sanremo, in the countryside,

393
00:45:15,876 --> 00:45:18,712
where your son and I plan
to set up our restaurant.

394
00:45:18,879 --> 00:45:21,673
How will you manage not being here?

395
00:45:21,841 --> 00:45:25,969
Hey, Franco, let me do that.

396
00:45:26,137 --> 00:45:27,303
Good evening, Madam.

397
00:45:27,471 --> 00:45:29,347
I'll go on Thursdays
when we are closed here,

398
00:45:29,515 --> 00:45:32,142
and between shifts 
whenever I can.

399
00:45:33,936 --> 00:45:37,063
- See you soon.
- With pleasure.

400
00:45:37,231 --> 00:45:38,690
Here I am!

401
00:46:50,513 --> 00:46:52,931
Mama! Grandma!

402
00:46:54,475 --> 00:46:56,601
How wonderful to see you.

403
00:47:01,857 --> 00:47:04,317
- How was the trip?
- Fine.

404
00:47:07,738 --> 00:47:09,948
- How are you?
- Very well.

405
00:47:12,201 --> 00:47:14,160
Betta!

406
00:47:22,211 --> 00:47:25,004
Why did you come?

407
00:47:25,172 --> 00:47:28,258
What do you mean, why?
What have you done?

408
00:47:28,425 --> 00:47:30,635
- Goodbye.
- What?

409
00:47:30,803 --> 00:47:32,387
Shall we go?

410
00:48:04,753 --> 00:48:08,381
I'm sorry I missed Eva's party.

411
00:48:08,549 --> 00:48:12,969
Edo's crazy about Antonio, right?
They want to open a restaurant.

412
00:48:13,137 --> 00:48:15,763
He wants me to stop off
on my way to Nice.

413
00:48:15,931 --> 00:48:18,099
- For your exhibition?
- Yes.

414
00:48:22,563 --> 00:48:25,732
- Can I tell you something?
- Of course.

415
00:48:35,701 --> 00:48:38,202
I left Gregorio for her.

416
00:48:39,413 --> 00:48:41,956
It's not a passing 
thing, I'm sure.

417
00:48:47,504 --> 00:48:49,380
Do you like her?

418
00:48:49,548 --> 00:48:52,133
She's beautiful.

419
00:48:52,301 --> 00:48:54,052
Very beautiful.

420
00:48:55,179 --> 00:48:58,056
I don't want to tell 
dad, or Gianluca.

421
00:48:58,223 --> 00:49:00,099
They wouldn't understand.

422
00:49:03,938 --> 00:49:07,106
Here, she looks amazing.

423
00:49:07,274 --> 00:49:08,691
Why don't you come 
to Nice with me?

424
00:49:13,989 --> 00:49:17,992
- I might.
- We can be together.

425
00:49:46,814 --> 00:49:49,774
Can I offer you 
something to drink?

426
00:49:49,942 --> 00:49:52,026
Why don't you come with me?

427
00:49:52,194 --> 00:49:54,862
We can look for a space
for my exhibition.

428
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:58,825
We'll leave on Tuesday,
Sanremo to Nice.

429
00:49:58,993 --> 00:50:01,077
What will you do when 
we're all in London?

430
00:50:01,245 --> 00:50:05,415
I grow the vegetables 
myself, near Sanremo.

431
00:50:05,582 --> 00:50:07,959
Her name's Angaharad,
she's my teacher.

432
00:50:08,127 --> 00:50:11,337
Edo can't stay anchored
to the past, things change.

433
00:50:42,536 --> 00:50:44,537
Edo, darling ...

434
00:50:44,705 --> 00:50:46,414
I'm out of town.

435
00:50:46,582 --> 00:50:49,208
I've decided to go 
to see Betta in Nice.

436
00:50:51,211 --> 00:50:52,462
But don't tell her.

437
00:50:56,175 --> 00:50:57,967
I'll call you later.

438
00:53:14,229 --> 00:53:16,939
- I'll be right with you, Madam.
- Thank you.

439
00:54:00,734 --> 00:54:03,152
Mrs. Recchi!

440
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:05,154
How come you're here?

441
00:54:05,322 --> 00:54:08,532
I'm going to visit Betta.

442
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:10,451
Oh, the exhibition in Nice.
Edo told me about it.

443
00:54:12,329 --> 00:54:15,581
- How about you?
- The restaurant is closed today.

444
00:54:15,749 --> 00:54:17,792
Right, it's Thursday ...

445
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:19,877
the countryside ... the vegetables.

446
00:54:20,879 --> 00:54:23,673
If you aren't too busy,
why don't you come with me?

447
00:54:24,925 --> 00:54:27,176
It's just a slight detour.

448
00:54:27,344 --> 00:54:29,971
I'll show you where Edo and I
will open the restaurant.

449
00:54:30,138 --> 00:54:31,889
He's already been 
there a few times.

450
00:54:32,933 --> 00:54:34,600
Okay.

451
00:54:35,602 --> 00:54:37,436
My truck's there.

452
00:55:13,765 --> 00:55:17,310
- Were you born here?
- No, my father's from here.

453
00:55:18,770 --> 00:55:23,107
The land is my grandfather's.
I started cooking here as a child.

454
00:55:24,526 --> 00:55:26,193
I love cooking,

455
00:55:26,361 --> 00:55:28,738
but I'm not as good as you.

456
00:55:28,905 --> 00:55:31,991
Edo tells me the opposite.
He always talks about you.

457
00:55:32,159 --> 00:55:33,576
And he talks to me about you.

458
00:55:34,953 --> 00:55:39,123
He'll be happy you came.

459
00:56:48,777 --> 00:56:52,029
Take a little walk around.
I'll be back in a bit.

460
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:54,881
Something smells good, Ida.

461
00:59:55,049 --> 00:59:57,759
I made spelt soup.

462
01:00:14,527 --> 01:00:17,321
Why don't you dine
with me this evening?

463
01:00:17,488 --> 01:00:20,407
It's strange being 
in an empty house.

464
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:24,411
Thank you, Madam,

465
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:27,372
but you know I have my ways.

466
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:29,625
- They could change.
- No ...

467
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:38,508
- Your son called.
- What did he say?

468
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:42,179
He asked if you'll pass by the factory
to say goodbye, before he leaves.

469
01:01:33,272 --> 01:01:35,565
Bye, see you in half an hour.

470
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:38,694
How are you, Eva?

471
01:01:54,252 --> 01:01:56,169
We fired too many workers.

472
01:01:56,337 --> 01:01:59,423
We had responsibilities 
towards them.

473
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:01,049
Think of their families.

474
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:03,510
Grandpa wouldn't have done this.

475
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:07,514
Yes, he would. He always did
what was best for the company.

476
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:08,849
That's not true.

477
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:13,061
Respect for the name, traditions
and values is what matters.

478
01:02:15,773 --> 01:02:18,275
There.

479
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:22,404
Don't be a hypocrite.
You know it's not like that.

480
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:25,282
Grandpa had no qualms about 
dealing with the regime,

481
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:28,076
acting as if nothing was going on ...

482
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:31,747
while he exploited Jewish workers.

483
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:33,248
That's what we are.

484
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:35,792
That's what we Recchis are.

485
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:38,420
We'll talk about 
this again in London.

486
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:41,757
Too many things are heading
in the wrong direction.

487
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:46,928
I'm always so happy to come here.

488
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:49,931
I came here with Grandpa as a kid.

489
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:54,644
He brought me here into the canteen
and sat amongst the workers.

490
01:02:54,812 --> 01:02:57,272
He enjoyed making them 
believe he was one of them.

491
01:03:00,234 --> 01:03:03,653
Time moves on. Things change.

492
01:03:28,387 --> 01:03:30,138
Mama, at last!

493
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:33,975
We've finished. Everything
is being sent to London today.

494
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:35,894
Are you coming to say goodbye?

495
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:38,355
Pity ...

496
01:03:38,523 --> 01:03:41,107
Never mind, it's nothing.
How are you, though?

497
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:54,598
Antonio!

498
01:05:10,031 --> 01:05:12,157
I wanted you to have 
it before I leave.

499
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:17,954
Your father has signed.

500
01:05:18,122 --> 01:05:22,542
He's granted us half of the land
and permission to open the restaurant.

501
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:27,797
You don't seem very happy.

502
01:05:36,557 --> 01:05:40,352
Tell you what, 
I'll look at the papers ...

503
01:05:40,519 --> 01:05:41,561
and we'll talk when you get back.

504
01:05:43,689 --> 01:05:45,690
If you aren't sure, just tell me.

505
01:05:45,858 --> 01:05:47,859
Sorry.

506
01:05:48,027 --> 01:05:50,987
You know how I am, certain 
things embarrass me.

507
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:09,589
We're hosting a big dinner.
My father wants you to handle it.

508
01:06:09,757 --> 01:06:12,133
It's an important business dinner.

509
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:15,136
My mother will call you
with the details.

510
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:18,556
Once you've read it, call me.

511
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:09,607
Do you like this CD?

512
01:08:22,139 --> 01:08:23,807
How are you?

513
01:08:23,974 --> 01:08:26,684
Good morning. A Chinotto please.

514
01:08:26,852 --> 01:08:28,353
Thanks.

515
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:35,652
So, for the dinner ...

516
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:39,948
What do you suggest?

517
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:42,575
Ligurian dishes?

518
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:50,708
You left this in the truck.

519
01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:34,247
Once, Edo told me about 
a dish you make for him.

520
01:11:34,415 --> 01:11:36,916
He said it's difficult to make.

521
01:11:37,084 --> 01:11:38,876
Ukha.

522
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:46,759
You need someone to catch

523
01:11:46,927 --> 01:11:51,431
a great deal of fish from a river ...

524
01:11:53,017 --> 01:11:55,018
lots of different kinds.

525
01:11:58,731 --> 01:12:01,149
The most important thing is ...

526
01:12:03,402 --> 01:12:08,031
that the broth must be clear.

527
01:12:09,783 --> 01:12:12,493
You must be able 
to see through it.

528
01:12:25,632 --> 01:12:30,261
When I moved to Milan,
I stopped being Russian.

529
01:12:30,429 --> 01:12:32,889
There was too much of everything,

530
01:12:33,057 --> 01:12:35,516
in the streets, in the shops ...

531
01:12:35,684 --> 01:12:39,562
I learned to be Italian.

532
01:12:41,148 --> 01:12:45,777
Tancredi collected art. He came
to Russia in search of treasure.

533
01:12:46,862 --> 01:12:49,906
My father was a restorer.

534
01:12:50,074 --> 01:12:52,617
Tancredi used to come 
to our house.

535
01:12:52,785 --> 01:12:55,912
One day he asked me out.

536
01:12:56,080 --> 01:13:00,041
He was shy and sweet.

537
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:02,043
We couldn't be seen in public,

538
01:13:02,211 --> 01:13:04,754
so we rode in a cab until dawn ...

539
01:13:04,922 --> 01:13:07,382
and then made love.

540
01:13:07,549 --> 01:13:10,093
He brought me to Milan ...

541
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:13,471
and I haven't been 
back to Russia since.

542
01:13:15,682 --> 01:13:18,393
If I got homesick, I cooked.

543
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:23,064
One day I made a soup that 
my grandmother taught me.

544
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:25,650
Ukha.

545
01:13:25,818 --> 01:13:29,487
Edo, who was six then,
liked it so much ...

546
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:32,323
he kept asking me to make more.

547
01:13:33,575 --> 01:13:36,661
Edo loves my being Russian.

548
01:13:40,582 --> 01:13:44,836
Emma ...

549
01:13:45,003 --> 01:13:49,132
Emma is not my real name.

550
01:13:49,299 --> 01:13:51,926
Tancredi gave it to me.

551
01:13:53,595 --> 01:13:55,972
What is your real name?

552
01:13:57,224 --> 01:13:59,267
I no longer know it.

553
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:07,358
At home ...

554
01:14:07,526 --> 01:14:09,694
they all called me Kitesh.

555
01:14:12,865 --> 01:14:14,657
Say it.

556
01:18:58,570 --> 01:19:00,112
Sell.

557
01:19:42,822 --> 01:19:47,242
Your grandfather was a great man,
but we have to look to the future.

558
01:20:13,144 --> 01:20:15,270
Papa!

559
01:20:15,438 --> 01:20:16,980
What, Edo?

560
01:21:26,759 --> 01:21:29,136
Gianluca took me to the Atlantique.

561
01:21:29,304 --> 01:21:33,140
I thought I'd get him back by
taking him to an Electrelane concert.

562
01:21:34,225 --> 01:21:36,059
But he loved it!

563
01:21:36,227 --> 01:21:40,188
Being among a crowd
of ecstatic lesbians!

564
01:21:48,907 --> 01:21:51,658
Betta, it's done. We're selling.

565
01:21:51,826 --> 01:21:54,912
We'll be even richer.

566
01:22:07,133 --> 01:22:08,467
Come here.

567
01:22:18,728 --> 01:22:21,480
Thanks, if it weren't for you ...

568
01:22:21,648 --> 01:22:24,942
You mustn't thank me.
I did it out of selfishness.

569
01:22:27,070 --> 01:22:29,613
I'm happy knowing you're happy.

570
01:22:32,033 --> 01:22:36,828
Happy? "Happy" is a word
that makes one sad.

571
01:22:44,504 --> 01:22:46,964
Why aren't you happy?

572
01:23:11,823 --> 01:23:14,866
Edo, what's wrong?

573
01:23:25,962 --> 01:23:28,422
- Can you give this to Mama?
- Yes, sure.

574
01:26:12,670 --> 01:26:15,380
You look nice with short hair.

575
01:26:20,970 --> 01:26:23,763
Did you speak to Edoardo?

576
01:26:23,931 --> 01:26:28,059
When we got back,
I found him relieved.

577
01:26:28,227 --> 01:26:30,187
It's important for us 
all to stick together.

578
01:26:33,691 --> 01:26:36,985
- Sorry, were you watching it?
- No, don't worry.

579
01:26:37,153 --> 01:26:38,945
I'm tired.

580
01:27:14,815 --> 01:27:16,608
- Liliana!
- Yes?

581
01:27:16,776 --> 01:27:19,402
They're here. Go and help them.

582
01:27:22,406 --> 01:27:24,824
Good morning, Madam.
Can I help you?

583
01:27:24,992 --> 01:27:26,034
Thank you.

584
01:27:36,170 --> 01:27:38,463
You disappeared without telling me.

585
01:28:10,496 --> 01:28:12,289
Good evening.

586
01:28:35,479 --> 01:28:38,690
Mama, let me introduce 
you to Shai Kubelkian.

587
01:28:39,817 --> 01:28:42,694
Good evening, I'm Rori.

588
01:28:42,862 --> 01:28:45,071
- Beatrice Tavecchia.
- Good evening.

589
01:28:59,211 --> 01:29:01,338
- Sorry?
- Tancredi told him you're Russian.

590
01:29:13,434 --> 01:29:14,601
Thanks.

591
01:29:28,574 --> 01:29:30,450
Can I talk to you?

592
01:29:36,290 --> 01:29:40,043
- I want to see you happy.
- I am happy.

593
01:29:40,211 --> 01:29:43,380
Thanks to you, to Antonio,
to my mother,

594
01:29:43,547 --> 01:29:46,424
and to him, or her.

595
01:29:50,054 --> 01:29:51,638
Excuse me.

596
01:29:51,806 --> 01:29:53,598
Mama!

597
01:30:52,867 --> 01:30:55,702
Does Edo know you 
prepared his soup?

598
01:30:55,870 --> 01:30:57,495
No, he doesn't.

599
01:30:57,663 --> 01:30:59,247
He'll be pleased.

600
01:31:59,186 --> 01:32:01,771
- You have wonderful children.
- Thanks.

601
01:33:09,673 --> 01:33:11,299
Darling ...

602
01:33:12,509 --> 01:33:13,759
Thank you, Mama.

603
01:33:15,262 --> 01:33:17,305
I'll go, you stay here.

604
01:33:22,060 --> 01:33:26,188
Please forgive us. You've now seen
an example of Russian temper.

605
01:33:27,816 --> 01:33:29,483
Edo and his mother ...

606
01:33:46,251 --> 01:33:48,085
Wait!

607
01:33:50,380 --> 01:33:52,214
Wait for me!

608
01:33:55,260 --> 01:33:57,094
Listen to me!

609
01:34:00,682 --> 01:34:02,725
Let's talk.

610
01:34:08,649 --> 01:34:11,233
I beg you, look at me and listen!

611
01:34:14,738 --> 01:34:17,531
- You're lying.
- What?

612
01:34:17,699 --> 01:34:20,117
- You're just like the others.
- What do you mean?

613
01:34:20,285 --> 01:34:22,620
You're just like Gianluca,
Papa, Antonio.

614
01:34:22,788 --> 01:34:26,290
You even gave him our ukha.

615
01:34:26,458 --> 01:34:29,627
I wanted to tell you something
important, but no ...

616
01:34:29,795 --> 01:34:32,630
I don't want anything to do 
with you, you're nothing to me.

617
01:34:32,798 --> 01:34:37,134
Trust me, Edo!

618
01:34:37,302 --> 01:34:38,344
Don't touch me!

619
01:35:54,337 --> 01:35:55,921
Good evening.

620
01:36:05,599 --> 01:36:07,391
I don't have good news ...

621
01:36:08,602 --> 01:36:12,062
Your son suffered a head injury ...

622
01:36:12,230 --> 01:36:15,483
which caused a hematoma
that pressed against his brain.

623
01:36:15,650 --> 01:36:18,903
So we removed it.

624
01:36:19,070 --> 01:36:24,158
But the fall also caused
a more serious hemorrhage.

625
01:36:29,372 --> 01:36:31,874
He never regained consciousness.

626
01:36:32,042 --> 01:36:34,794
I don't think he suffered.

627
01:36:36,838 --> 01:36:39,006
I'm sorry.

628
01:36:39,174 --> 01:36:41,383
I'll take you to him.

629
01:40:58,558 --> 01:41:00,476
Kitesh ...

630
01:41:03,354 --> 01:41:04,855
Emma!

631
01:41:32,175 --> 01:41:34,009
Madam.

632
01:41:40,934 --> 01:41:43,018
You have to wake up.

633
01:42:54,507 --> 01:42:56,383
Our Lord Jesus Christ,

634
01:42:56,551 --> 01:42:59,261
who after resting three 
days in the sepulcher ...

635
01:42:59,429 --> 01:43:03,140
gave assurance of resurrection ...

636
01:43:03,308 --> 01:43:06,560
to those who believe in You,

637
01:43:06,728 --> 01:43:11,023
let our brother Edoardo
rest in peace ...

638
01:43:11,191 --> 01:43:15,944
until the day You, the 
Resurrection and the Life,

639
01:43:16,112 --> 01:43:19,781
will illuminate him with the 
splendor of Your vision ...

640
01:43:19,949 --> 01:43:23,827
so that he may see the glory
of Your Kingdom,

641
01:43:23,995 --> 01:43:27,247
You who live and reign eternally.

642
01:43:27,415 --> 01:43:29,499
Amen.

643
01:43:31,336 --> 01:43:32,794
Give him everlasting rest ...

644
01:43:32,962 --> 01:43:34,546
and eternal peace ...

645
01:43:34,714 --> 01:43:38,675
in the glory of Your light. Amen.

646
01:47:50,761 --> 01:47:53,889
Emma ...

647
01:48:16,537 --> 01:48:21,211
You no longer know who I am.

648
01:48:32,848 --> 01:48:36,184
Darling, please.

649
01:48:36,352 --> 01:48:39,229
We mustn't go out of our minds.

650
01:48:40,648 --> 01:48:43,066
We have to carry on.

651
01:48:46,487 --> 01:48:48,905
Together.

652
01:49:37,788 --> 01:49:40,623
I love Antonio.

653
01:50:17,286 --> 01:50:20,246
You don't exist.

654
01:51:25,854 --> 01:51:34,779
Madam!

655
01:53:52,668 --> 01:53:56,128
Gianluca?

656
01:53:56,296 --> 01:53:57,922
Rori?

657
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:18,359
Betta?

658
01:54:27,619 --> 01:54:29,245
Mama?
