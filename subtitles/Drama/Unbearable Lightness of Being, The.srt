Tomas?

186
00:26:08,747 --> 00:26:10,681

from Geneva.

187

They are still
offering you that job.

Why should I go
to Geneva?

won't interfere?

They couldn't.
The world wouldn't allow it.

with a human face.

back to your farm.

Is sleeping with your mother
the same sort of crime?

with his mother...

he couldn't bear
the sight of what he'd done.

He plucked out
his own eyes and left.

He did not feel innocent.

01:53:51,505 --> 01:53:53,439
Tomas.

1026
01:53:53,507 --> 01:53:56,067
Tomas.

1027
01:53:57,477 --> 01:53:59,570
Oh...

1028
01:53:59,646 --> 01:54:01,910
Oh!

1029
01:54:01,982 --> 01:54:04,917
Oh...

1030
01:54:04,985 --> 01:54:08,079
Oh...

1031
01:54:16,029 --> 01:54:18,930
I really
don't like to do this.

1032
01:54:18,999 --> 01:54:20,694
I shouldn't
have to do this.

1033
01:54:20,767 --> 01:54:25,170
You remember the article you wrote
about King Oedipus?

1034
01:54:25,238 --> 01:54:28,730
How communist leaders
should have put out their eyes?

1035
01:54:28,808 --> 01:54:32,005
Yes, I'd almost forgotten.

1036
01:54:33,747 --> 01:54:36,147
Well, they haven't.

1037
01:54:39,252 --> 01:54:41,686
They've prepared
this little letter...

1038
01:54:41,755 --> 01:54:43,689
sort of retraction.

1039
01:54:43,757 --> 01:54:45,725
Say you got it wrong,

1040
01:54:45,792 --> 01:54:48,090
you really
didn't understand...

1041
01:54:48,161 --> 01:54:50,356
You sign. That's all.

1042
01:54:51,798 --> 01:54:54,062
Don't misunderstand.

1043
01:54:54,134 --> 01:54:57,228
They're not asking for
a public declaration.

1044
01:54:57,304 --> 01:54:59,704
They're just
prudent bureaucrats.

1045
01:54:59,773 --> 01:55:01,832
They've given me
their word.

1046
01:55:01,908 --> 01:55:05,139
They won't
publish anything.

1047
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:10,543
I need you, Tomas.

1048
01:55:11,885 --> 01:55:14,581
I hope I can keep you.

1049
01:55:14,654 --> 01:55:18,317
You're not a writer,
savior of the country.

1050
01:55:18,391 --> 01:55:20,951
You're a doctor.
A scientist.

1051
01:55:23,363 --> 01:55:27,299
This article's so terribly
important to you?

1052
01:55:29,302 --> 01:55:31,065
It couldn't be
less important.

1053
01:55:56,378 --> 01:55:57,777
Hi, Tomas.

1054
01:55:57,847 --> 01:55:58,939
Hi.

1055
01:56:06,388 --> 01:56:08,322
Tomas.

1056
01:56:08,390 --> 01:56:09,789
Hello, Jiri!

1057
01:56:09,859 --> 01:56:12,327
It's nice to
see you back.

1058
01:56:12,394 --> 01:56:13,793
How are you?

1059
01:56:13,863 --> 01:56:15,956
Thanks, fine.

1060
01:56:16,031 --> 01:56:21,469
So...are you going to sign
the...thing?

1061
01:56:21,537 --> 01:56:23,232
What thing?

1062
01:56:23,305 --> 01:56:26,297
Mmm...your, um...

1063
01:56:26,375 --> 01:56:28,468
retraction.

1064
01:56:30,412 --> 01:56:33,711
What do you know
about my retraction?

1065
01:56:35,384 --> 01:56:37,318
Have you read it?

1066
01:56:37,386 --> 01:56:38,853
No.

1067
01:56:38,921 --> 01:56:41,981
But you know
how things work.

1068
01:56:44,894 --> 01:56:48,990
Who told you I had agreed
to go along with it?

1069
01:56:55,437 --> 01:56:56,927
See you.

1070
01:56:57,006 --> 01:56:58,997
Ha ha ha ha...

1071
01:57:19,428 --> 01:57:21,862
I suppose
a lot of them

1072
01:57:21,931 --> 01:57:23,899
have signed
these letters.

1073
01:57:23,966 --> 01:57:25,900
They're kept
on file.

1074
01:57:25,968 --> 01:57:29,369
They know they can be published
at any moment,

1075
01:57:29,438 --> 01:57:31,872
so they
keep quiet, see?

1076
01:57:31,941 --> 01:57:34,375
They can't say
anything anymore.

1077
01:57:34,443 --> 01:57:37,207
They accept
everything.

1078
01:57:40,449 --> 01:57:44,545
Cowardice slowly becomes
a rule of life.

1079
01:57:46,455 --> 01:57:48,889
Yes, I have
the feeling

1080
01:57:48,958 --> 01:57:52,894
that everyone would be
very happy to see me sign.

1081
01:57:52,962 --> 01:57:55,055
Everyone...
everyone but me.

1082
01:58:41,510 --> 01:58:44,604
So...what can
I do for you?

1083
01:58:46,015 --> 01:58:50,884
There is nothing you can do
for me, Doctor.

1084
01:58:50,953 --> 01:58:54,753
I represent
the Ministry of the Interior.

1085
01:58:58,694 --> 01:59:02,528
Everybody at the Ministry
regrets seeing you here.

1086
01:59:02,598 --> 01:59:06,591
You are one of our best
brain specialists.

1087
01:59:06,668 --> 01:59:08,101
Just between us--

1088
01:59:08,170 --> 01:59:10,604
maybe I shouldn't
say it--

1089
01:59:10,672 --> 01:59:14,608
we don't all agree
with the drastic tactics

1090
01:59:14,676 --> 01:59:20,114
that are removing our top specialists
from their posts.

1091
01:59:21,417 --> 01:59:24,784
One can only be sorry
about all this.

1092
01:59:27,222 --> 01:59:28,621
May I?

1093
01:59:28,690 --> 01:59:30,282
Please.

1094
01:59:33,195 --> 01:59:36,130
You had a very good
position in Geneva,

1095
01:59:36,198 --> 01:59:38,632
and you came back
to our country.

1096
01:59:38,700 --> 01:59:41,669
We very much appreciate
your having returned,

1097
01:59:41,737 --> 01:59:44,672
but your place is at
the operating table.

1098
01:59:44,740 --> 01:59:46,799
I couldn't agree more.

1099
01:59:46,875 --> 01:59:48,638
Everybody agrees.

1100
01:59:48,710 --> 01:59:51,975
Then...
tell me, Doctor...

1101
01:59:52,047 --> 01:59:54,140
do you really think

1102
01:59:54,216 --> 01:59:58,516
that communists should pluck out
their own eyes?

1103
02:00:00,222 --> 02:00:03,157
You, who have healed
so many people?

1104
02:00:03,225 --> 02:00:05,193
That wasn't what I meant.

1105
02:00:05,260 --> 02:00:07,660
But that's how everyone
understood it.

1106
02:00:07,729 --> 02:00:10,664
And we can
only regret it.

1107
02:00:10,732 --> 02:00:13,667
How can you
let people think

1108
02:00:13,735 --> 02:00:15,703
that you,
a doctor,

1109
02:00:15,771 --> 02:00:20,504
want to deprive human beings
of their right to see?

1110
02:00:23,345 --> 02:00:25,279
Maybe someone
inspired this article?

1111
02:00:25,347 --> 02:00:26,939
No, no one.

1112
02:00:27,015 --> 02:00:28,949
Did you know
the publishers?

1113
02:00:29,017 --> 02:00:29,984
No.

1114
02:00:30,052 --> 02:00:31,451
You never spoke?

1115
02:00:31,520 --> 02:00:35,456
Once, they asked me over
to discuss the article.

1116
02:00:35,524 --> 02:00:38,015
Who was it
you talked to?

1117
02:00:38,093 --> 02:00:40,220
One of the editors.

1118
02:00:40,295 --> 02:00:42,354
What was his name?

1119
02:00:53,775 --> 02:00:57,006
I don't remember.

1120
02:00:57,079 --> 02:00:59,104
I've no idea.

1121
02:01:01,817 --> 02:01:04,980
What did he look like?

1122
02:01:05,053 --> 02:01:06,816
I can't remember.

1123
02:01:06,889 --> 02:01:10,222
Tell me
the truth, Doctor.

1124
02:01:12,828 --> 02:01:14,728
He was tall...

1125
02:01:14,796 --> 02:01:18,391
with...short, blond hair.

1126
02:01:25,340 --> 02:01:27,900
A little stooped, hmm?

1127
02:01:28,844 --> 02:01:30,243
Perhaps.

1128
02:01:30,312 --> 02:01:34,009
And how did he react?

1129
02:01:34,082 --> 02:01:36,243
What did
he say exactly?

1130
02:01:36,318 --> 02:01:39,754
He asked me
to make some changes.

1131
02:01:39,821 --> 02:01:41,789
So...

1132
02:01:41,857 --> 02:01:47,420
you might have been
manipulated, Doctor.

1133
02:01:48,830 --> 02:01:50,263
Used.

1134
02:01:50,332 --> 02:01:52,800
Whether you
meant to or not,

1135
02:01:52,868 --> 02:01:55,029
your article
contributed to

1136
02:01:55,103 --> 02:01:57,435
the anti-communist
hysteria.

1137
02:01:59,241 --> 02:02:03,940
Nobody requires a doctor
to understand politics.

1138
02:02:09,418 --> 02:02:15,357
Of course, we can't allow
a politically suspicious man

1139
02:02:15,424 --> 02:02:17,949
to operate on brains.

1140
02:02:21,897 --> 02:02:25,958
We have here
another declaration.

1141
02:02:28,870 --> 02:02:31,964
I would
advise you to sign.

1142
02:02:39,381 --> 02:02:41,474
"This temporary error...

1143
02:02:43,385 --> 02:02:47,481
due to bad influences from
so-called intellectuals...

1144
02:02:48,890 --> 02:02:51,825
doesn't in any way
put in doubt

1145
02:02:51,893 --> 02:02:54,862
my faithfulness to
the Communist party

1146
02:02:54,930 --> 02:02:58,366
or my admiration
for the Soviet Union."

1147
02:02:58,433 --> 02:03:01,368
Of course, Doctor,
it's only a proposition,

1148
02:03:01,436 --> 02:03:02,835
a first draft.

1149
02:03:02,904 --> 02:03:05,873
If there is something
you want to change...

1150
02:03:05,941 --> 02:03:08,501
after all,
it's your statement.

1151
02:03:10,912 --> 02:03:13,847
Just a paper
to keep in their files.

1152
02:03:13,915 --> 02:03:15,405
It's nothing.

1153
02:03:15,484 --> 02:03:17,850
Just in case
someone reproaches them

1154
02:03:17,919 --> 02:03:20,513
for letting you
work here.

1155
02:04:42,003 --> 02:04:45,097
Good evening,
Excellency.

1156
02:04:53,515 --> 02:04:55,949
Why do they call him
Excellency?

1157
02:04:56,017 --> 02:04:59,817
He was an ambassador
in Vienna...before.

1158
02:04:59,888 --> 02:05:01,116
Oh.

1159
02:05:16,037 --> 02:05:18,130
Give me a cognac.

1160
02:05:21,042 --> 02:05:22,976
Ah. Ha.

1161
02:05:23,044 --> 02:05:24,944
Are you 18?

1162
02:05:25,013 --> 02:05:25,911
Yes.

1163
02:05:25,981 --> 02:05:30,145
May I see
your identification card?

1164
02:05:34,556 --> 02:05:35,488
Haaa.

1165
02:05:35,557 --> 02:05:37,149
Ugh! Drunk.

1166
02:05:38,827 --> 02:05:40,886
Give me a drink.

1167
02:05:43,098 --> 02:05:45,362
Give me a drink.

1168
02:05:48,036 --> 02:05:50,596
All right.

1169
02:05:50,672 --> 02:05:53,163
You have
beautiful legs!

1170
02:05:54,576 --> 02:05:57,977
I watched you
in the street.

1171
02:06:08,123 --> 02:06:09,249
Ugh.

1172
02:06:23,104 --> 02:06:24,071
Ow!

1173
02:06:24,139 --> 02:06:27,131
Stay here.
I want to look at you.

1174
02:06:27,209 --> 02:06:28,870
I love you!

1175
02:06:28,944 --> 02:06:30,878
Ohhh!

1176
02:06:32,047 --> 02:06:34,311
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

1177
02:06:56,037 --> 02:06:57,470
Madame.

1178
02:06:57,539 --> 02:07:01,839
You have no right
to serve alcohol to minors.

1179
02:07:01,910 --> 02:07:03,741
That was lemonade.

1180
02:07:03,812 --> 02:07:06,576
Do you think
I did not see

1181
02:07:06,648 --> 02:07:09,378
what else you put
into his lemonade?

1182
02:07:09,451 --> 02:07:11,612
What are you
talking about?

1183
02:07:11,686 --> 02:07:15,087
I've been watching you
for some time now.

1184
02:07:15,156 --> 02:07:18,091
Then be grateful
you're watching a beauty,

1185
02:07:18,159 --> 02:07:20,127
and keep your mouth shut.

1186
02:07:20,195 --> 02:07:22,095
You stay
out of this.

1187
02:07:22,163 --> 02:07:25,257
What business
