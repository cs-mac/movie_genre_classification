1
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:46,740
They make cushions for the knees
but not for the ass?

2
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,170
I told you this wouldn't work.

3
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,010
Good drummers are
hard to find anywhere.

4
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:05,560
Two, three, four--

5
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,810
Just a minute!

6
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,670
Your necklace.

7
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,940
-What are you, deaf? The necklace!
-I'd like to keep it.

8
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,820
You'll get it back in a few days.

9
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:28,530
-You got a plane to catch?
-What do you mean?

10
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,790
You're playing like you're in a hurry
to get somewhere.

11
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,730
I agree.

12
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:36,100
-I'm not pushing it. You're too slow.
-I'm too slow?

13
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,830
I'm too slow?

14
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,240
-Luna!
-What?

15
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,210
If she's too fast
and you're too slow...

16
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,870
maybe you could both play
a medium tempo.

17
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,780
-A nun telling me how to rock.
-"Medium"?

18
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,320
Listen, baby.
There's no "medium"tempo.

19
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,480
There's only one tempo...

20
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:56,110
and it's mine
and this fucking isn't!

21
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,380
Go to hell!

22
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:02,290
The Minister for Internal Affairs
called an hour ago.

23
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,030
She wants you to play
at the Policeman's Ball.

24
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,970
A classy idea.
Right before the elections.

25
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,710
Provided, of course, I ensure that...

26
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,330
there will be no problems.

27
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:22,450
-Can I?
-You can trust my ladies.

28
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:24,610
There's a first time for everything.

29
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,230
Hey! Where are you going?

30
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:42,100
I don't need this shit from you!
Besides, I'm getting out in two days.

31
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:52,040
-Wrapping airline utensils-- so boring.
-What should I write on the napkin?

32
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,510
"Warning! Bomb on board!"

33
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:57,780
"You're eating this?
No wonder you're fat!"

34
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:01,020
"The pilot is screwing your wife."

35
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,350
"Your dog is dead in cargo."

36
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,530
"To Otto."

37
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:18,470
Oh, shit! Now I have to do them
all over again.

38
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,470
Where will you find the time?

39
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:26,710
Hello. I'm Angel.

40
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,490
That's Marie. She's a little--

41
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,990
She's been in here for a million years.
But she can fly.

42
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,630
Marie, what are you doing?

43
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,250
What are you staring at?
You got a problem?

44
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,780
No, I don't.

45
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,720
Nothing I'd discuss with you, anyway.

46
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,420
Oh, really?

47
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,060
And why not?

48
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,050
I wouldn't expect you to understand.

49
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,000
-That was an insult, right?
-Yep.

50
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:36,050
And that's Luna.

51
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,690
"Only you, you, you--"

52
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:18,020
"You have to cross seven bridges--"

53
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:23,590
-"Resi, I'm comin' for the tractor."
-I'm not singing that German shit.

54
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,760
Look, we wait for the cops
to get drunk...

55
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,360
then we can play anything we want.

56
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,940
Is that the sheet music?

57
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,210
No.

58
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,840
I can't read music anyway.

59
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:39,240
It's from Gold Records.

60
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,350
-A rejection.
-Big surprise.

61
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,420
They're not interested
in people like us.

62
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,890
We'll try again.

63
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:52,390
-What about the Policeman's Ball?
-Who gives a fuck?

64
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:57,290
One, two, three.
One, two--

65
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,570
Emma, you don't take part
in recreational activities.

66
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,770
You don't go to church.
You don't talk to the other women.

67
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,900
I have no leisure time.
I don't believe in God.

68
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,070
And I hate to talk.

69
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,510
Time passes slowly in prison.

70
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:20,710
- You can't just wait for years.
- Sure, I can.

71
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,460
For what?

72
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,620
For the sunset in Guyana.

73
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,860
It says on your record
that you were a musician.

74
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,130
The band is looking for someone
to play drums...

75
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,110
for the Policeman's Ball.

76
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,840
Would you be interested in that?

77
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:51,750
Well, then, what would you rather do?

78
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,660
You fucking pricks! Hurry up!
Damn it!

79
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:10,900
You're sure taking your time,
you stupid pigs. Come on!

80
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:15,310
Wake up!
I know you can hear me, goddamn it!

81
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:19,570
Hey! Wake up!

82
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:31,390
Damn it!
It's that stupid old bitch again!

83
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,150
Quiet!

84
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:42,040
You're letting her die,
you stupid fucks!

85
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,700
Alert the sick ward
before she bleeds to death!

86
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,430
-Can't you hurry it up?
-Just shut up!

87
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,800
What a mess!

88
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,980
Marie!

89
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,560
Appeal denied.
This decision is final, huh?

90
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,390
Yes.

91
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:08,690
So I'll be 42 then.

92
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:15,300
-Didn't they submit the photos?
-I'm sorry.

93
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,840
You'll probably be out
in only seven years.

94
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,410
That's comforting.

95
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:28,140
- Sorry.
- Wait a minute.

96
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,840
Yesterday you said three of a kind
was better than a straight.

97
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:32,920
That was before I had a straight.

98
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:38,890
What about a full house?

99
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:42,090
-That's cheating!
-No, it's "bluffing".

100
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,890
Hey... Hey, that was really--

101
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,960
I thought that was... wow!
I mean, that was through the roof!.

102
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,400
That was beautiful.

103
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:32,240
Wait, hold on five minutes!
One minute! A second!

104
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:34,870
Say something.

105
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:38,820
-Boy, you play pro ball, huh?
-Angel, get out of her way.

106
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,690
Tell her, Luna.

107
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,150
It was okay.

108
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,090
Okay? What do you mean, okay--

109
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,120
Aw, man!

110
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:57,660
Come on. Drummers always sit
in the back anyway.

111
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,400
What's the matter? You scared?

112
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,980
Everybody out! Now!
Everybody out!

113
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,890
Legs apart!

114
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,850
Just shut up
and get against the wall!

115
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,720
If we don't find the stuff,
you're all in trouble. Got it?

116
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,070
If I were a little birdie

117
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:33,640
Shut up!

118
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:37,970
And I had two little wings

119
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,210
- I'd fly to you--
- I said shut up!

120
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,540
But since that won't come true

121
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,180
But since that won't come true

122
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:53,780
I'll stay right here

123
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:59,260
If I were a little birdie
And had two little wings

124
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:01,130
I'd fly to you

125
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,860
But since that won't come true

126
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:07,940
I'll stay right here

127
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:31,720
Okay. "Pearls Before Swine,"
"Masturbation"...

128
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:34,300
"Crazy Motherfuckers"
or maybe just "Motherfuckers."

129
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,390
Or "Kill, Kill, Kill."

130
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,630
-Perfect.
-That's no name for a band.

131
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:42,640
Okay, I've got "Jailbirds,"
"Angel and the Banshees"...

132
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:45,710
or just "The Angels."

133
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:49,310
-"Jailbirds" isn't bad.
-"Bandits."

134
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:53,950
-"Bandits."
-"Band" and "tits"--

135
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:56,420
Why didn't I think of that?

136
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:00,960
-Luna?
-"Bandits." Fine. Fuck it.

137
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:04,660
Okay, then. Put down "Bandits."

138
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,870
Hold it!

139
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:14,270
Let's get one thing straight.
I do the counting.

140
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:18,070
Fine. If you can count that high.

141
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,710
- One, two--
- Three, four.

142
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:49,400
For that special occasion.

143
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,730
Bring some cute cops back
with you!

144
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:21,490
-I want one with a moustache!
-No problem!

145
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,740
I have to work this weekend
because of you stupid bitches.

146
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:13,410
Hey, Angel, you play trumpet, right?

147
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:17,580
Give me a blowjob, loosen those lips.
Do us both good.

148
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,360
Go play with your dick, Rick.

149
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,430
And so it's my pleasure to present...

150
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:38,380
this medal
to Inspector Robert Schwarz...

151
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,510
in honor of his outstanding work...

152
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,510
for the Criminal Investigation Division.

153
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:03,870
Nobody's here. They're probably
getting drunk already.

154
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:05,730
Go in and tell them we've arrived.

155
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,770
So... what are you going to play?

156
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,610
"A Good Man is Hard to Find"
and all that shit?

157
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,640
What was it you were singing
at rehearsal?

158
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:27,180
I'd do anything for you

159
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:29,920
'Cause I'm a filthy little bitch

160
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,630
So how does that feel, huh?

161
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,230
Luna! What are you doing?

162
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:12,200
They're gonna kill us for this!
I mean, really kill us!

163
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:14,270
You've got no clue, man! No clue!

164
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,740
Hey, Luna. The key!

165
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:24,240
Unlock 'em!
Unlock our handcuffs!

166
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,330
These women deserve a chance.

167
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:43,430
In fact, it is our duty
to integrate these women...

168
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,940
back into society.

169
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,780
Shit!

170
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,400
-Move it!
-Damn it! Where's reverse?

171
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,340
Watch out!

172
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,550
Sorry about that.

173
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,520
- Drive much?
- Pull over! I'm gonna throw up!

174
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,180
-Not now!
-Yes, now!

175
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,800
Oh, God.
I changed my mind.

176
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,630
Drive!

177
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,540
So I hope...

178
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,300
we all have a wonderful evening
listening to--

179
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:26,970
-What are they called again?
-Escape attempt!

180
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:31,620
A wonderful evening with...

181
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,020
"Escape Attempt"!

182
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,640
Get that car out of the way!

183
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,040
-Turn on the blues!
-Are you nuts?

184
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:01,540
Where's the goddamn switch?

185
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:03,840
Hello?

186
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,650
Leave it on!

187
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:26,100
-I don't see any police.
-I'm not complaining.

188
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:29,970
I can't believe we actually lost them!
With this piece-of-shit van!

189
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,550
Pull over.
Now I really gotta throw up.

190
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:45,110
Imagine their fat faces when
they realize the band didn't show up!

191
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,200
Hey, relax. Everything's cool.

192
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:01,470
Cool?

193
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:04,340
Excuse me,
but I don't think any of this is cool.

194
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:08,140
Luna, they're gonna put us away
in solitary for this stupid joyride!

195
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:11,650
They'll shave our heads!
And everything else.

196
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,280
And it's all her fault!

197
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:17,210
I was getting out soon.
Now I'll be as old as Marie!

198
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:20,690
There's a phone. Call the police.

199
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:23,190
Say it was a mistake. Go on.

200
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:27,730
- Maybe they'll forget it if we go back.
- What are you, nuts?

201
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:31,700
I'm out and I'm staying out.
I don't think I'll miss the nun.

202
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:33,740
But we have no money...

203
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,930
these clothes aren't exactly hip...

204
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,600
and that ugly van--

205
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:39,680
Know what your problem is, Angel?

206
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,180
You're a dope.

207
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:46,550
-Better a dope than dead.
-I'd like to go home.

208
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:50,110
-What are we gonna do?
-Don't ask me!

209
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,920
Think for yourself for once.
Shit!

210
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:56,590
Come on.
We're all in the same canoe.

211
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:01,300
Hey, Marie! Marie!

212
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,630
-"Boat."
-Huh?

213
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:09,300
-"Boat." We're all in an identical boat.
-You mean, the "same."

214
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:11,210
-What?
-The same boat.

215
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:13,040
Smart-ass!

216
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:15,480
-Cigarillo, madame?
-No, thank you.

217
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:18,550
-Yes, please.
-Any leads so far?

218
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:20,480
Afraid of not being re-elected?

219
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:24,550
Just out of curiosity...

220
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,650
why were four felons let out of jail?

221
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:32,060
Our latest concept for reintegrating
prisoners into society...

222
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:35,730
encourages them to develop
and put to use their unique abilities.

223
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,470
Sounds like that's exactly
what they're doing right now.

224
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,940
Let me put it this way:

225
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,100
If one person in that lovely band
of yours...

226
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:48,940
endangers one of my colleagues,
they're dead meat.

227
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:51,180
Got it, Dr. Roth?

228
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:56,850
-How long before you can catch them?
-I've never had a case that lasted...

229
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,430
longer than a pack of cigarillos.

230
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,060
Fast enough for you?

231
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,690
Marie, you can't get on board
without papers.

232
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:08,100
Sure. Nobody cares where you're from.

233
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,900
Just what kind of music you play.

234
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,700
- One word: "Harry."
- He's an old friend of mine.

235
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:15,540
Works for a shipping company.
Very discreet.

236
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:19,080
Five hundred marks
and he gets you on the ship.

237
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:23,470
Thanks, Marie.

238
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,880
I'll write you a postcard.

239
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:28,980
-Where shall I send it?
-I'm staying here.

240
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,720
All I want...

241
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:32,860
is to go see Otto.

242
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:36,900
Marie Irgang poisoned her husband
with arsenic.

243
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,900
Over two years' time. A little dose
every day. Schizophrenic tendencies.

244
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,230
Suicidal.

245
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:45,540
Ludmilla Nabiba. Armed robbery,
repeat offender.

246
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:49,500
Extremely violent.
Low threshold for frustration.

247
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,910
Angelika Kleinschmidt.

248
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:09,720
Several convictions, bigamy, fraud.
Quite an achievement for a 23-year-old.

249
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:14,060
Cooperative.

250
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:18,930
Emma Moor. Played in a jazz band
once. Even got offers from the U.S.

251
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,170
Guy in the band couldn't handle it.
Allegedly beat her.

252
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,400
-Until she shot him.
-Slight tendency to overreact, huh?

253
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:28,450
The court ruled out self-defense.

254
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:33,420
So where's the child now?

255
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,390
I want to know
who they called from prison...

256
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:38,180
when, what they discussed
and for how long.

257
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:41,190
Who came to see them?
Who were they hot for?

258
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:43,350
All of it! Get to work!

259
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,490
I'm going to Guyana.

260
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,790
South America.

261
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,700
- You're leaving? I mean, that far?
- With a ship's band.

262
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,170
-And you?
-Beats me.

263
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:01,040
But I won't be playing guitar
on the goddamn Love Boat.

264
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:12,160
Say, can I go with you?

265
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:15,090
That's up to you, Angel.

266
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,760
I gotta pee.

267
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:23,600
Hey, not so hard. Don't blame
the poor vending machine.

268
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,030
For what?

269
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,300
That you're too dumb to crack it.

270
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:29,270
You've got a problem with that?

271
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:32,780
I'm sorry! I'm really sorry!

272
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,750
They shot the little dog.

273
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:47,460
-Whose turn is it?
-I'm up next.

274
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:51,520
Go ahead. Let one of 'em loose.

275
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:53,460
I'd reconsider if I were you.

276
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,400
Yes?

277
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:03,180
You still haven't found the van?

278
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,210
Are we the police
or the Braille Institute?

279
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:10,580
Actually, 20% of female fugitives
return on their own.

280
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:16,710
It's 1 8 feet long,
9 feet high, and has 4 wheels.

281
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,850
And it's green. Got it? Green!

282
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:25,860
Hey, I'm in the mood
for some yogurt.

283
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:10,700
They did what?

284
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:12,210
Made 'em strip...

285
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:14,940
and rub dog shit all over themselves.

286
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,980
Okay, I get the picture.
License number?

287
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,580
HR HR 123. Thanks.

288
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:23,490
-At least they have a sense of humor.
-Harry?

289
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:28,530
No. No, I'm out.

290
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:30,860
Oh, I guess things could be worse.

291
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,530
I'm gonna visit Otto. Hello?

292
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:39,900
Harry? We're talking about
the MS Ikarus, right? Tell me:

293
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:44,140
Will this plan work, or am I insane?
When's it leave? And how much?

294
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:48,440
10,000 marks. Per person?

295
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:51,810
-Yell it a little louder.
-You need money? Hit a bank.

296
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,890
-Forget it.
-Why not? I've done it lots of times.

297
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:56,480
Piece of cake.

298
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:58,490
That's why you keep ending up
in the pen.

299
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:02,250
- There has to be a legal way.
- Legal?

300
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,260
Angel has 1 00,000 stashed away.

301
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:10,500
Are you crazy?
That was a secret.

302
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:14,740
Besides, it's for my future.

303
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,140
-Well, we have to respect that.
-No, we don't!

304
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:22,370
Turn down that fucking TV!

305
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,680
Is "fuck"the only word you know?

306
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,910
There are other ways
to express things.

307
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:30,480
Excuse me.
I didn't know you were a poet.

308
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:32,490
Pardon me, we'd really like to talk.

309
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:35,580
-Could you turn down the TV?
-No!

310
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,790
What is this?
"The Customer Is An Asshole"week?

311
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:42,600
We don't want people like you
in here anyway!

312
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,230
...successful escape.

313
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:47,430
The spectacular prison break
Saturday night--

314
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,060
They're gonna show our pictures.

315
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:52,510
André Roder and Herbert Rahn,
both serious repeat offenders...

316
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:55,340
convicted of murder
in the death of a banker...

317
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:56,850
escaped from Frankfurt Prison.

318
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:59,680
A large-scale manhunt is underway.

319
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,580
Now, the weather.

320
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:05,650
-Not a word about us.
-What the fuck is that all about?

321
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,090
Don't we count?
I mean, we broke out too.

322
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,630
This is the best thing
that could happen to us.

323
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:14,290
They only want them.

324
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,230
But I want them to want me.

325
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,400
I want someone to look for me,
for a change.

326
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,610
I don't believe this.

327
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:31,650
Hello? Listen, dick, how come
you put those jerks on TV but not us?

328
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:35,210
After all I went through.
I almost got a necklash.

329
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,750
"Whiplash," idiot.

330
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:40,260
-Don't call me an idiot!
-What? What?

331
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:42,690
Hello!

332
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:48,660
He wants to meet with us.

333
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:51,640
- Think he'll make us undress on camera?
- I told him you'd give him a blowjob.

334
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:54,330
Very funny. What'll we talk about?

335
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,340
-We'll think of something.
-Talk with whom?

336
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,570
We didn't even make the newspaper.
What does it take to get written up?

337
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:06,280
Just die. Then they'll put you
on the back page. Right, Marie?

338
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,950
Now you've totally lost it.

339
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:23,360
-Okay, so you broke out of prison.
-Good start.

340
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:25,440
Aren't you afraid of getting caught?

341
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:29,300
We're afraid of so many other things.

342
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,480
-For example?
-Super Glue.

343
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:42,180
If you get it in your eyes,
you can't open them. Right?

344
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:52,650
You'd just have to look
through your lids.

345
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:56,060
-All I can see is black.
-All you ever see is black.

346
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:58,300
That's not my fault.

347
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:07,240
So what are you gonna do next?
Disappear? Hide out?

348
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:10,650
I'd like to be carried away
like a queen. All the way to Gu--

349
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:14,510
Could you lend us some money?

350
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:22,150
Think we have a chance?

351
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:38,110
I wish I could fly.
Aw, erase that--

352
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,180
-We make music.
-We're a band.

353
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:51,760
-"Bandits."
-Rock and roll. You know?

354
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:00,920
Blitz TV with an exclusive interview.

355
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:04,160
Described by police
as extremely dangerous...

356
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:07,210
the fugitives call themselves
"Bandits. "

357
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:10,940
We don't know
where they're going...

358
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,940
but we can assure you--

359
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,010
Aren't you afraid of the police?

360
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:28,120
Police? What police?

361
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:30,490
I don't see any police around here.

362
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,430
You seriously don't know
where they are?

363
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:36,160
I told you. They called me.

364
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:39,200
-84% of all prisoners--
-Anyway, I met them there.

365
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:43,840
Next time, you take us with you,
is that clear?

366
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:46,610
You've heard of aiding and abetting
criminals, right?

367
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:47,780
Sure.

368
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:50,310
Welcome to the team.

369
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:58,240
Sentimental shit.

370
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,740
-Agreed.
-What's that mean? You don't like it?

371
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,280
As a matter of fact, I do.
Very much.

372
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,420
How deep did you bury this shit?
Damn it!

373
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:20,830
Maybe it was another tree.

374
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:24,330
You've been saying that for two hours!
You want to dig up the whole forest?

375
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:28,270
The man at the hardware store
told me aluminum doesn't rust.

376
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:31,710
- It's a real waste hazard.
- I found something.

377
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:34,280
-I found something!
-Really?

378
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,610
It sounds like metal.

379
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:41,710
-What's that?
-An unexploded bomb.

380
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,310
What?

381
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:46,020
A dud. From World War II.

382
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:48,790
-Can it explode?
-Not anymore.

383
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:52,260
Only if you keep pounding on it!

384
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,130
Shit!

385
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:01,970
Get out of here! Run!

386
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:04,030
Hurry up!

387
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,390
I told you nothing would happen.

388
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:21,120
So what do we do about money now?

389
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,850
I really did leave it here.

390
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:30,060
I swear.

391
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,700
Yeah, right.

392
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,940
Stop lying, Angel.

393
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:45,250
Where are you all going?

394
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:48,050
This next song will appeal
to your criminal instincts.

395
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:52,060
"Puppet on a String"
by your favorite fugitives, "Bandits."

396
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,660
That's our song.

397
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,500
That's my song.

398
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:20,040
That's our song.

399
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:23,890
-But they rejected it.
-I knew it. I knew it was good.

400
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,550
Don't they have to get
our permission?

401
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,720
What can we do? Sue 'em?

402
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:30,990
-What?
-Exactly.

403
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,030
Listen! My solo.

404
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,130
Be careful. That rug is Nepalese silk.

405
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,400
Very sensitive to stains.

406
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:42,940
- A little present from Phil.
- Phil who?

407
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,140
Collins.

408
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:48,150
Listen, buddy, if you want
to play our song on the radio--

409
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:50,110
I was just test-marketing it.

410
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:53,050
I'd like to help you, but I don't know
how best to do it.

411
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:55,480
Forty.

412
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:58,720
-Forty what?
-Thousand.

413
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:03,720
Forty thousand to test-market
your song?

414
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:06,060
But I haven't made a cent yet.

415
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:10,570
I get a funny feeling
you're trying to rip us off.

416
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:12,800
What do you need forty grand for?

417
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:17,340
- A quick getaway?
- Come on, you won't even miss it.

418
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,440
-You won't get far on 40,000.
-So give us more.

419
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:25,950
Who do you think you are?

420
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,580
The Rolling Stones?

421
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:32,680
You're just four losers from prison...

422
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:35,690
who make a lousy excuse for music.

423
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,030
The only reason you'd sell at all
is because the police are after you.

424
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:41,530
He who lives for money
gets nothing but money.

425
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:42,460
What?

426
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:44,260
He who lives for money--

427
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:48,500
Listen, there's a million musicians
out there.

428
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:51,340
And they're a thousand times better
than you!

429
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:57,040
But we're the only ones who make
big coffee stains.

430
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:58,840
What are you doing?

431
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,810
Oh, so sorry.

432
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,450
Are you all crazy? Stop it!

433
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,320
Forty thousand
or we start on the walls next.

434
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:12,300
- Okay, okay. Thirty thousand.
- Didn't I just say forty?

435
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,420
I'll give you thirty,
but on one condition:

436
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,800
You all sign this.

437
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:25,470
Our names are already on it.

438
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:27,550
It's just a formal agreement...

439
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:30,440
that I can keep testing the song.

440
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:33,520
-Fifty thousand.
-You got it!

441
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:53,340
- Oh, no.
- Fuck!

442
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,910
- Where?
- Oh, no!

443
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:56,800
- Oh, yes!
- Now what?

444
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:58,600
Sunglasses.

445
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:03,940
All I heard was an explosion,
and when I got here, they were gone.

446
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:06,280
They dug up the whole forest.

447
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:08,290
What did he say? His accent--

448
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:10,860
Something about digging up
the forest, sir.

449
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,550
-Big groundhogs around here.
-Wow!

450
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:18,990
I suppose they could have buried
money here once.

451
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,400
Think they found it?

452
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:25,100
- I have no idea.
-They have to get money somewhere.

453
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:31,200
-Maybe someone owes them a favor.
-Right. Go on.

454
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:34,580
Someone who can help them
get out of the country.

455
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,670
What makes you so sure
they'll leave the country?

456
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:40,150
Statistically, 68% stay inside
the federal borders--

457
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:44,350
Schneider, do you quote statistics
even when you fuck?

458
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:46,580
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

459
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:49,720
-Ludwig.
-Anytime I can help the police.

460
00:42:49,830 --> 00:42:51,730
-God bless.
-My pleasure.

461
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:53,090
Thank you.

462
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,530
They found the Land Rover
near Frankfurt.

463
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:57,500
Sounds like they're heading north.

464
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:00,940
I swear, it's going to be a hit.

465
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:05,200
Even their worst song
is sure to be a hit.

466
00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:08,800
And I have the rights for just fifty.

467
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:13,380
I hate to interrupt, but--

468
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,680
"Fuck you. Come fly with me.
Elvis. Fucking coffee."

469
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:47,180
What a lovely place. It's so red.

470
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:03,120
Hey, what's wrong?

471
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:09,040
I always wanted to be a clue
in the "Bravo" crossword puzzle.

472
00:44:10,310 --> 00:44:12,300
So?

473
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:16,010
They don't run
the crossword puzzle anymore.

474
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:25,490
I need a mark-- now.

475
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:43,000
When you're dead,
you get eaten up by worms.

476
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,870
I don't want to be eaten up.

477
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:50,550
-I want to burn.
-Whatever you say, Marie.

478
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:03,450
Hey, bartender! Vodka!

479
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:15,100
We're gonna take little break.

480
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:19,490
-So, shall I come up for some coffee?
-Yes.

481
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:29,230
Yes?

482
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:30,540
Where?

483
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:35,550
What's more important to you:
sex with me or your career?

484
00:47:37,550 --> 00:47:39,210
Sex with you.

485
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:43,050
I know a better way
to get an orgasm. We've got 'em!

486
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:33,900
Luna!

487
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,310
-What?
-Luna, the cops!

488
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:43,470
Ladies and gentlemen,
sorry to interrupt.

489
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:46,420
Inspector Schwarz, CI D.

490
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:48,280
I hate to disturb
your musical interlude...

491
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:50,690
but these ladies are under arrest.

492
00:48:50,790 --> 00:48:52,810
Stay where you are.
You're surrounded.

493
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,620
-Keep calm.
-What do we do?

494
00:48:54,730 --> 00:48:57,520
We should take a hostage.

495
00:49:00,030 --> 00:49:01,900
Okay, who wants to come along?

496
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:05,900
-Everybody stay put!
-Nobody move!

497
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,230
-Drop the gun!
-Let's take the blond guy.

498
00:49:08,370 --> 00:49:11,140
-No, that one.
-Make up your mind.

499
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:13,400
-Don't move!
-Him!

500
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:16,580
Come here!

501
00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:25,980
You're Emma, right? Emma, calm down.
Everything's all right.

502
00:49:26,090 --> 00:49:27,750
Drop it! You can't get away.

503
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:31,730
-Oh, yeah?
-Emma, let him go.

504
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:35,160
-Nice to meet you. I'm Emma.
-Hi. West.

505
00:49:39,970 --> 00:49:42,630
Drop your guns! No guns!

506
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:44,710
Just let us through!

507
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:48,310
We'll let you go,
but let's talk first.

508
00:49:48,410 --> 00:49:51,210
Don't buy it. Want us to blow
his pretty head off?

509
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:52,840
Let me help you.

510
00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:56,850
-Then call your men back!
-I'll let you go if you let him go.

511
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,420
I give you my word.

512
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:06,590
-Drop your guns.
-Let's go!

513
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:10,100
-Emma, take me instead!
-Go fuck yourself!.

514
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:13,100
-Out of the way!
-Where's your car?

515
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:18,370
They're heading for the VW van.
Attach a transmitter to it.

516
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:22,140
-If I see one squad car, he's dead!
-You can peel him off the sidewalk!

517
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:25,440
We'll give 'em a head start,
then we'll follow 'em.

518
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:32,190
-Well?
-I didn't make it.

519
00:50:32,290 --> 00:50:33,260
Shit!

520
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:36,460
How are you doing?

521
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:42,500
Shit.

522
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:46,660
- I can't believe I just did that.
- Very professional.

523
00:50:46,770 --> 00:50:49,300
Now every cop in the free world
is after us.

524
00:50:56,450 --> 00:50:59,010
We have to call Harry.
We need to go now.

525
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:33,610
Is there anything you wanted to do
but were afraid to?

526
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:36,020
Have a kid.

527
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:37,420
Not a thing.

528
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:40,890
You'd be afraid to kiss someone
if you wanted to.

529
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:42,980
Why would I want to?

530
00:51:55,470 --> 00:51:57,170
Oh, yeah? Nice to meet you.
I'm Emma.

531
00:51:58,610 --> 00:52:01,310
They've vanished into thin air.

532
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:03,570
This tape goes to every news staff...

533
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,910
at every dinky station in the country.

534
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:07,750
I want this shit on the 6:00 news.

535
00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:10,950
Who's the weak link?

536
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:14,460
- Angelika Kleinschmidt.
- Right.

537
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:15,890
So that's the one we go for.

538
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,390
Will you fill it out, honey?

539
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,300
You rarely see couples
stay in Germany for their honeymoon.

540
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,470
We said to ourselves,
"There's no place like home."

541
00:52:27,570 --> 00:52:29,040
Right.

542
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:33,080
-Here you are.
-Thanks. Let's go, dear.

543
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:54,390
Yeah, I know what it costs, Harry.
We already have the money.

544
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:56,560
When does the next ship leave?

545
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,030
Three weeks? Yeah, okay.

546
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:04,200
We'll be there. Call you later.

547
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:19,060
Born April 20. An Aries.

548
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:22,290
How cute!

549
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:25,090
Massachusetts. American.

550
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:29,790
My first time in Germany.
Just wanted to see the sights.

551
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:31,530
A tourist!

552
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:34,610
-I bet he's a good kisser.
-You think?

553
00:53:35,710 --> 00:53:39,370
- You're right.
- Upper body needs some work.

554
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:42,280
Is it true that all Americans
wear boxer shorts?

555
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:44,920
-I'm sure. White?
-Red?

556
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:46,240
-Green?
-With smiley faces?

557
00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:49,220
-I can't remember.
-Let's see for ourselves.

558
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:52,920
You must be getting awfully hot.

559
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,230
Our ship leaves in three weeks.

560
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:08,970
We just have to lie low until then.

561
00:54:09,070 --> 00:54:11,470
You're missing a party.

562
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:30,100
Following a high-speed chase...

563
00:57:30,210 --> 00:57:33,200
Herbert Rahn was killed
in an exchange of gunfire.

564
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:39,780
His accomplice, André Roder...

565
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:42,680
who received
multiple gunshot wounds...

566
00:57:42,790 --> 00:57:44,850
died this morning
en route to the hospital.

567
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:50,260
We live with death our entire life.

568
00:57:51,130 --> 00:57:56,070
Until the moment it actually occurs.

569
00:57:57,970 --> 00:57:59,630
Luna's gone.

570
00:58:00,670 --> 00:58:03,300
Oh, shit! Shit!

571
00:58:25,430 --> 00:58:26,490
Luna.

572
00:58:34,810 --> 00:58:36,360
Kiss my ass!

573
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:40,910
Damn it, Luna.

574
00:58:41,010 --> 00:58:44,570
- Are you asking for them to catch us?
- You mean, to catch you?

575
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:48,040
That's not what I said.

576
00:58:49,450 --> 00:58:51,890
This place really stinks!

577
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:57,480
-It stinks like piss!
-What do you want, anyway?

578
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:02,130
I mean, you don't give a shit
what happens to us.

579
00:59:03,270 --> 00:59:06,000
You're just watching out
for yourself.

580
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:11,730
You wouldn't even notice
if the rest of us were gone.

581
00:59:21,990 --> 00:59:25,920
Tell me what you want from me.

582
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:28,420
I just want--

583
00:59:28,530 --> 00:59:31,220
Oh, get lost.
Like everybody else does.

584
00:59:31,330 --> 00:59:34,590
You know what?
I'm really sick of your self-pity act.

585
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:37,130
You aren't the only one in the world
who's been hurt.

586
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,290
Oh, yeah? Tell me about it.

587
00:59:41,470 --> 00:59:43,370
I don't want to talk about it.

588
00:59:43,470 --> 00:59:47,540
Well, I want to talk about it.

589
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:51,880
For one thing, I'd like to talk about
why you don't want to talk about it.

590
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:55,710
I see. People don't talk
about those things in your circles.

591
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:59,050
Everything's so very discreet.

592
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:03,860
-Don't try to understand me.
-That guy you shot dead--

593
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:06,800
I bet he didn't understand you either.

594
01:00:07,530 --> 01:00:10,520
-I don't want to talk about it.
-Exactly how did it happen?

595
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:14,770
You played together in a jazz band,
right?

596
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,840
And then one day he wasn't
good enough for you anymore.

597
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:21,670
I can just see it.

598
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:25,080
You wanted to ditch him,
and he got pissed off.

599
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:27,240
Then he grabbed on
to your middle-class ass.

600
01:00:27,350 --> 01:00:29,620
Or was it your middle-class tits?

601
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:33,090
But nobody does that to you.
So you snapped, right?

602
01:00:33,190 --> 01:00:37,130
And since Emma here is ruthless,
she shot him dead.

603
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:46,090
I knew someone
who was ruthless once.

604
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:50,240
You know what he did?

605
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:53,170
He beat me.

606
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:58,050
He beat--

607
01:00:58,150 --> 01:01:02,020
He beat the life
right out of my body.

608
01:01:03,790 --> 01:01:07,780
In fact, he tried to beat me to death,
but he didn't succeed.

609
01:01:08,390 --> 01:01:10,520
Oh, God.

610
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:16,120
He only beat me till I passed out...

611
01:01:16,230 --> 01:01:19,640
and then I woke up in the hospital.

612
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:22,500
When I was there--

613
01:01:23,510 --> 01:01:26,840
When I was there,
I wished I was dead.

614
01:01:27,910 --> 01:01:31,140
I wished that he had finished
the job.

615
01:01:34,450 --> 01:01:37,150
That I was the one who was dead...

616
01:01:38,690 --> 01:01:41,220
and not my baby.

617
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:46,530
The child that had grown inside me.
Understand?

618
01:02:06,850 --> 01:02:11,450
I'm sorry.
Sometimes I say things--

619
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:13,920
I just don't know.

620
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:22,720
Yes?

621
01:02:22,830 --> 01:02:25,030
I'm coming with you.

622
01:02:28,370 --> 01:02:30,640
I know. I know.

623
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:42,150
"BANDITS
Now on CD, Cassette and LP"

624
01:02:43,550 --> 01:02:44,920
Oh shit!

625
01:02:48,530 --> 01:02:51,260
Fantastic. It almost looks real.

626
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:52,760
Wonderful.

627
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:55,260
It is real, you idiot.

628
01:03:10,180 --> 01:03:12,150
I'm concerned about the hostage.

629
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:24,350
Perfect timing to have our faces
spread all over town.

630
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:28,660
Great. My mother will be so proud
to buy my record.

631
01:03:28,770 --> 01:03:30,320
Our record.

632
01:03:32,270 --> 01:03:35,240
What's going on here?

633
01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:36,970
Rush hour.

634
01:03:37,070 --> 01:03:39,540
You wouldn't understand, Angel,
You never had to rush.

635
01:03:43,180 --> 01:03:45,710
Hey, aren't you the "Bandits"?

636
01:03:47,550 --> 01:03:48,520
Yeah.

637
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:50,710
Wow! Can I have your autograph?

638
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:52,190
No problem.

639
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:07,660
Are you the hostage?

640
01:04:13,210 --> 01:04:14,910
Don't push. One at a time.

641
01:06:54,940 --> 01:06:57,200
-May I? Sorry.
-That's enough!

642
01:06:57,310 --> 01:07:00,400
Get this shit out of here!
Recycle it.

643
01:07:00,510 --> 01:07:05,110
-Or donate it to the poor.
-Boss, people keep calling in.

644
01:07:05,220 --> 01:07:07,740
15 definite sightings, 20 cranks...

645
01:07:07,850 --> 01:07:10,510
43 complaints, and get this:

646
01:07:10,620 --> 01:07:13,750
1,427 support them.

647
01:07:13,860 --> 01:07:16,880
Sure, they'll cheer on
a bunch of female convicts.

648
01:07:16,990 --> 01:07:21,590
But let them steal their car
and they want a police state.

649
01:07:29,110 --> 01:07:30,540
Great.

650
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:33,770
I'm finally a pop star
and nobody can recognize me.

651
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:36,870
Besides, I'm cold.

652
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:41,110
We can't even play anywhere.

653
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:44,210
Nine more days
and we got it made.

654
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:46,310
I want to go see Otto.

655
01:07:46,420 --> 01:07:48,390
Didn't you say it was too far away?

656
01:07:48,490 --> 01:07:50,120
Not really.

657
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:53,530
Hey, could I take a picture?

658
01:07:53,630 --> 01:07:55,600
Nobody back home will believe this.

659
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:57,060
Sure.

660
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:00,130
I'm partial to this one here.
It's in a no-parking zone anyway.

661
01:08:06,510 --> 01:08:09,810
Can you do it one more time?
I didn't get it.

662
01:08:10,250 --> 01:08:13,240
-Sure. Because it's you.
-West!

663
01:08:15,050 --> 01:08:17,890
I'd really prefer this one.

664
01:08:29,970 --> 01:08:32,530
I bet you can't do it now.

665
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:40,110
What's taking Marie so long?

666
01:08:40,210 --> 01:08:43,540
She said she'd be back in an hour.
It's been almost three.

667
01:08:43,750 --> 01:08:47,110
She's probably got a lot to say
to Otto after thirteen years.

668
01:08:50,150 --> 01:08:52,490
Where does Otto live, anyway?

669
01:09:21,620 --> 01:09:23,210
That's Otto?

670
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:31,350
How long have you known this,
Marie?

671
01:09:33,060 --> 01:09:35,690
A year after I went to prison...

672
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:39,690
he died.

673
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:44,570
I asked if there was any room
for me here.

674
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:46,470
If he'd move over a bit.

675
01:09:48,050 --> 01:09:49,710
And what did he say?

676
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:52,380
Yes.

677
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:11,130
Opening night, my husband Paul
in the first row...

678
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:13,830
and Otto was playing
"Mack the Knife."

679
01:10:13,940 --> 01:10:16,910
And suddenly he raced over...

680
01:10:17,010 --> 01:10:18,800
yanked me
out of the orchestra pit...

681
01:10:18,910 --> 01:10:20,380
and screamed in my ear...

682
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:23,670
"Sing, Marie.
Do you see the moon over Soho?"

683
01:10:23,780 --> 01:10:27,180
And I said, "I see it, love.
Do you feel my heart pounding?"

684
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:29,340
And he said, "I feel it, darling."

685
01:10:29,450 --> 01:10:31,750
And I said,
"I'll go wherever you go."

686
01:10:32,220 --> 01:10:35,160
And he said...

687
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:38,460
"Wherever you may be...

688
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:43,730
I want to be there, too.

689
01:10:45,940 --> 01:10:49,390
Love lasts, or it doesn't...

690
01:10:52,740 --> 01:10:55,210
in this place or another."

691
01:10:56,410 --> 01:10:57,970
Otto.

692
01:11:10,530 --> 01:11:12,150
Hey, Marie! Move over!

693
01:11:15,530 --> 01:11:17,260
Wait for me!

694
01:11:22,470 --> 01:11:24,910
Shit! I think I lost my pants!

695
01:11:25,010 --> 01:11:27,500
Luna! Come on in!

696
01:11:27,650 --> 01:11:29,110
No, I--

697
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:32,680
I don't like swimming.

698
01:11:53,940 --> 01:11:57,400
I'm going to buy us something to eat.
Want anything special?

699
01:11:57,510 --> 01:11:59,530
West?

700
01:12:16,490 --> 01:12:18,460
They didn't even pay the bill.

701
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:20,830
1,476 marks.

702
01:12:20,930 --> 01:12:23,090
-This is every telephone call?
-Yes.

703
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:25,190
-Did we tap that guy?
-Harry?

704
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:27,100
The men are on it now.

705
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:29,240
This isn't too ironic.

706
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:32,310
We slave our butts off day and night...

707
01:12:32,410 --> 01:12:34,780
and they have a party.

708
01:12:46,890 --> 01:12:48,520
We've got 'em.

709
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:49,610
West Frazier.

710
01:12:51,230 --> 01:12:56,460
F-r-a-z-i-e-r.

711
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:01,400
Thanks, Harry.
That's sweet of you. Bye.

712
01:13:41,350 --> 01:13:43,280
-Hello?
-Hello, Angel.

713
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:46,850
Inspector Schwarz here.
I'd say you're in trouble.

714
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:20,650
You have beautiful eyes.

715
01:14:20,750 --> 01:14:22,240
Yeah, right.

716
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:28,350
Just shut up.

717
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:31,530
My dream vacation:
sitting in cow shit in some barn.

718
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:34,440
You got a better idea?

719
01:17:35,310 --> 01:17:37,410
You girls ought to do what I do.

720
01:17:37,510 --> 01:17:40,380
You should use your heads.

721
01:17:41,850 --> 01:17:44,650
Everybody is responsible
for their own actions.

722
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:46,550
So it's okay then if I smack you?

723
01:17:46,660 --> 01:17:50,090
As long as you take responsibility.

724
01:17:54,530 --> 01:17:57,000
-Is anything wrong?
-No. Should there be?

725
01:17:58,100 --> 01:17:59,570
Just asking.

726
01:18:01,540 --> 01:18:03,030
So now you know.

727
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:10,210
-Can I have the paper later?
-I'm not finished.

728
01:18:10,310 --> 01:18:13,010
-I said "later".
-Yeah, I heard you.

729
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:16,350
-I just asked.
-Since when do you ask, anyway?

730
01:18:16,450 --> 01:18:19,790
Just say what's bugging you.
For once.

731
01:18:19,890 --> 01:18:23,790
-I always feel like I'm on a quiz show.
-You're the one who puts on a show.

732
01:18:23,890 --> 01:18:26,090
At least I call things as they are.

733
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:28,760
No fairy tales
about buried treasures.

734
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:31,830
'Cause you've never had any to bury.

735
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:38,270
Shut up!

736
01:19:24,390 --> 01:19:26,250
Are you okay? Should I drive?

737
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:27,880
What?

738
01:19:28,260 --> 01:19:30,490
Should I drive?

739
01:19:49,980 --> 01:19:52,010
Our ship sets sail in exactly
54 hours.

740
01:19:53,780 --> 01:19:55,450
I can see it now.
There's a bar below deck.

741
01:19:56,490 --> 01:19:59,050
Right. And a pool table.

742
01:19:59,890 --> 01:20:02,480
And crew guys with their shirts off.

743
01:20:04,930 --> 01:20:07,160
We have to get out of here.

744
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:09,360
Isn't that what we're talking about?

745
01:20:09,470 --> 01:20:11,870
No, I mean now.

746
01:20:11,970 --> 01:20:14,940
Keep playing, Marie.
That was so nice.

747
01:20:16,710 --> 01:20:19,040
I need to tell you
something important.

748
01:20:20,410 --> 01:20:21,380
But--

749
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:25,780
Marie?

750
01:20:43,670 --> 01:20:45,530
She's not breathing.

751
01:21:03,690 --> 01:21:06,050
Do they still have the hostage?

752
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:08,680
No, it doesn't look like it.

753
01:21:09,630 --> 01:21:11,960
Block off the bridge behind them.

754
01:21:12,060 --> 01:21:14,090
Elbe 1 3 to SEZ. Block off the bridge.

755
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:19,160
This is it.
No more life on the road for me.

756
01:21:37,550 --> 01:21:40,350
Why is there nobody around?

757
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:51,660
Oh, my God--

758
01:22:04,380 --> 01:22:06,540
What's going on, damn it?

759
01:22:08,050 --> 01:22:09,780
Police. Everywhere.

760
01:22:15,630 --> 01:22:17,620
Something's wrong.

761
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:35,370
We're moving in!

762
01:22:40,150 --> 01:22:41,810
Luna, come on!

763
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:44,250
We have to get out of here!

764
01:22:45,290 --> 01:22:48,280
No, I'm not going to leave her alone.

765
01:22:48,390 --> 01:22:51,550
She's dead! You can't help her.

766
01:22:51,660 --> 01:22:53,600
Let me go! I'm not leaving!

767
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:01,600
Listen.

768
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:05,070
Do you remember
what Marie always said about death?

769
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:09,200
Luna, what did Marie always say
about death?

770
01:23:09,310 --> 01:23:11,110
"We live with death our entire life.

771
01:23:12,450 --> 01:23:14,180
Until the moment it actually occurs."

772
01:23:15,590 --> 01:23:16,980
Yeah.

773
01:23:17,090 --> 01:23:20,110
I never understood
what she meant until now.

774
01:23:21,490 --> 01:23:23,820
She's finally where
she always wanted to be.

775
01:23:30,970 --> 01:23:32,590
They're getting closer.

776
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:41,710
You made her a promise.

777
01:24:02,270 --> 01:24:04,560
What are they doing?

778
01:24:59,820 --> 01:25:01,120
Don't shoot!

779
01:26:01,550 --> 01:26:03,540
-Come on, damn it!
-I'm not jumping!

780
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:07,350
I'll hold on to you, okay?

781
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:13,460
See, it's really easy.

782
01:27:03,310 --> 01:27:05,180
Hi. Get her out of here.

783
01:27:10,450 --> 01:27:12,390
You think they survived?

784
01:27:12,490 --> 01:27:14,550
Of course they did.

785
01:27:26,940 --> 01:27:29,560
Marie! Marie!

786
01:27:37,910 --> 01:27:39,540
Need a light?

787
01:28:04,210 --> 01:28:06,330
I have a little theory.

788
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:10,110
Only the dumb criminals
end up in prison.

789
01:28:10,210 --> 01:28:13,880
I consider you the exception.
Intelligent. Talented, no less.

790
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:17,050
I really like your music. Honestly.

791
01:28:17,650 --> 01:28:19,520
I even bought a copy of your CD.

792
01:28:23,790 --> 01:28:26,850
But you have one weakness, Emma.

793
01:28:28,900 --> 01:28:31,870
You align yourself with people
who don't deserve it.

794
01:28:31,970 --> 01:28:34,600
Do I have to sit here
and listen to this guy jack off?

795
01:28:35,740 --> 01:28:37,730
Surely you must have considered that.

796
01:28:38,740 --> 01:28:40,770
Because that's why
you're sitting here.

797
01:28:48,420 --> 01:28:52,220
We weren't on that bridge
by coincidence, Emma.

798
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:56,350
You have two choices.

799
01:28:56,460 --> 01:29:00,160
Tell me where your friends are
and I promise you'll get leniency.

800
01:29:00,260 --> 01:29:01,920
If you don't help me, well...

801
01:29:02,030 --> 01:29:05,260
your two friends might not
make it out of the country.

802
01:29:06,370 --> 01:29:10,000
You wanted to leave the country,
right?

803
01:29:14,610 --> 01:29:16,640
You have until tomorrow morning
to decide...

804
01:29:16,750 --> 01:29:18,480
how important your friends are.

805
01:29:26,290 --> 01:29:28,090
That's too bad.

806
01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:33,090
Do I tell the prosecutor...

807
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:35,160
that these women
are harmless fugitives...

808
01:29:35,260 --> 01:29:37,130
or do I say they pose a danger
to the public?

809
01:29:37,230 --> 01:29:39,000
The difference is 15 years.

810
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:44,330
Would you like to get out of here
at 35 or wait until you're 50?

811
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:13,130
I'm sure she's in some dark cell.

812
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:15,200
High-security wing.

813
01:30:17,910 --> 01:30:19,840
And it's full of cops.

814
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:25,070
-And they're armed, right?
-Of course. With machine guns.

815
01:30:27,320 --> 01:30:30,440
One big security zone.
There's no way in without explosives.

816
01:30:30,550 --> 01:30:33,320
And once you're in,
you'll never get out again.

817
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:44,000
"Pro - 1 , Con - 23"

818
01:31:19,940 --> 01:31:21,960
She's not talking.

819
01:31:22,070 --> 01:31:25,970
All we can do is hope
the others try to contact her.

820
01:31:26,410 --> 01:31:30,240
-Feel like some coffee?
-At my place or yours?

821
01:31:31,680 --> 01:31:35,410
Sorry, I won't be getting it up
till those women are behind bars.

822
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:36,820
Stop.

823
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:02,010
- Let her go!
- Drop the gun!

824
01:32:02,110 --> 01:32:04,240
Careful!
Angel there is a lousy shot.

825
01:32:07,880 --> 01:32:10,910
-See what I mean?
-Okay, drop your gun.

826
01:32:15,860 --> 01:32:18,260
Yeah. And away to the side.

827
01:32:18,360 --> 01:32:21,420
- Kick it away.
- Yeah, kick it!

828
01:32:21,860 --> 01:32:24,360
-You're making a big mistake.
-Just one of many, mister.

829
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,370
One more won't make a difference.

830
01:32:31,210 --> 01:32:32,770
Thank you.

831
01:32:35,980 --> 01:32:37,280
Excuse me.

832
01:32:49,890 --> 01:32:50,820
Good evening.

833
01:32:57,270 --> 01:32:59,730
Want to spend the rest of your life
in the high-security wing?

834
01:33:02,940 --> 01:33:05,240
Angel, you're young.

835
01:33:05,340 --> 01:33:07,240
You're good-looking.
A talented swindler.

836
01:33:07,340 --> 01:33:10,510
-Don't you ever think of your future?
-Shut up!

837
01:33:13,950 --> 01:33:15,920
That thing's pretty heavy, isn't it?

838
01:33:16,020 --> 01:33:18,580
Come on, put it down.

839
01:33:18,690 --> 01:33:20,590
You know I won't do anything...

840
01:33:20,690 --> 01:33:22,820
until my partner returns unharmed.

841
01:33:22,930 --> 01:33:25,020
You can trust me, Angel.

842
01:33:41,640 --> 01:33:44,410
Quiet in there,
or we'll kick your ass!

843
01:33:58,630 --> 01:34:02,290
"Freedom's just another word
for nothing left to lose. "

844
01:34:02,900 --> 01:34:07,030
And you see how far Janis got
with that philosophy of life.

845
01:34:07,770 --> 01:34:09,800
Better dead than a dope.

846
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:19,680
Where'd you get
the fancy suspenders?

847
01:34:19,780 --> 01:34:21,510
From your wife?

848
01:34:23,350 --> 01:34:26,620
-I'm divorced.
-Did she leave or did you?

849
01:34:27,860 --> 01:34:30,120
My wife left me.

850
01:34:31,830 --> 01:34:34,320
Abandoned men are dangerous.

851
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:45,470
Thank you.

852
01:34:47,610 --> 01:34:49,270
My pleasure.

853
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:54,110
Hello, Inspector.

854
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:02,990
It's okay.

855
01:35:13,370 --> 01:35:16,600
It's been quite a nice journey
up until now, hasn't it?

856
01:35:24,450 --> 01:35:28,980
Actually, it was the best time
I've ever had in my entire life.

857
01:35:34,990 --> 01:35:37,460
-Emma?
-Yeah.

858
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:40,890
I need to tell you something.

859
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:47,730
The police didn't show up
on that bridge just by coincidence.

860
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:50,730
Everything's set.

861
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:55,840
-Are you two okay?
-Sure.

862
01:35:55,950 --> 01:35:57,410
Good.

863
01:35:58,280 --> 01:36:01,270
In exactly 36 hours and 20 minutes,
we'll be on our way.

864
01:36:01,380 --> 01:36:03,610
Just imagine:
A bar on a sandy beach...

865
01:36:03,720 --> 01:36:05,350
a glass full of Caipirinha.

866
01:36:05,450 --> 01:36:07,050
Sunshine.

867
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:09,950
Our only worry:
A coconut might fall on our heads.

868
01:36:10,060 --> 01:36:15,360
In a year I'm sure we'll speak
fluent South American, right?

869
01:36:15,460 --> 01:36:16,930
Right.

870
01:36:19,470 --> 01:36:22,200
I wonder what Marie's doing now.

871
01:36:22,300 --> 01:36:24,240
Probably playing piano for Otto.

872
01:36:24,340 --> 01:36:26,210
I hope he likes our songs.

873
01:36:26,310 --> 01:36:27,780
Sure.

874
01:36:28,740 --> 01:36:30,800
Someday I'm going to do it
the same way.

875
01:36:30,910 --> 01:36:34,250
Just decide when it's time to die.

876
01:36:35,050 --> 01:36:39,080
With my luck, I'll be reborn as a rat
in a test lab.

877
01:36:40,120 --> 01:36:43,020
No, you'll be a panther in the jungle.

878
01:36:44,060 --> 01:36:47,360
I want to come back as you.

879
01:36:47,460 --> 01:36:50,090
Honest. Or as you.

880
01:36:50,700 --> 01:36:54,660
Or as me.
But with a little bit more up here.

881
01:36:54,770 --> 01:36:56,760
Or as Marie.

882
01:36:58,970 --> 01:37:02,430
At least then we can be reunited.
Play just like before.

883
01:37:22,360 --> 01:37:25,090
"'Bandits' Outsmart Detectives"

884
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:28,390
"'Bandits' Disappear"

885
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:30,170
"'Bandits': Are They Dead?"

886
01:37:30,270 --> 01:37:32,240
"'Bandits' Spotted In Asia"

887
01:37:37,610 --> 01:37:40,550
They're gone. I'm 1 00% sure.

888
01:37:40,650 --> 01:37:42,280
They're not gone.

889
01:37:56,270 --> 01:37:57,490
"We were here."

890
01:38:01,470 --> 01:38:03,440
I can't believe it.

891
01:38:03,540 --> 01:38:05,630
We haven't heard from them in ages.

892
01:38:05,740 --> 01:38:07,470
And we always did before.

893
01:38:07,910 --> 01:38:11,240
We'll get them
if it's the last thing I do.

894
01:38:11,350 --> 01:38:13,140
They're getting on my balls!

895
01:38:14,820 --> 01:38:18,650
My neighbor asked me
if they ever give another concert...

896
01:38:18,750 --> 01:38:20,350
would I go with her?

897
01:38:29,830 --> 01:38:34,860
Surveillance on every club, bar
and concert hall in the city.

898
01:38:36,370 --> 01:38:38,770
They're crazy.
They're out of their minds.

899
01:38:38,870 --> 01:38:41,100
They just want to bug me.

900
01:41:44,390 --> 01:41:45,860
Yes?

901
01:41:50,470 --> 01:41:51,930
They're playing.

902
01:44:58,420 --> 01:45:02,790
Boss, they just jumped
from the roof, and the people--
