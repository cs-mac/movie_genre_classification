1
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:27,016
CLOSE TO LEO

2
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:39,281
Give me an "acorn" too.

3
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:46,866
- Are the rum babas fresh?
- Give me a break, Leo.

4
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:50,859
I'll take two. That'll be all.

5
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:57,810
Put it on the account. 'Bye!

6
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,803
No more baguettes?

7
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:09,889
What's that?

8
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:11,858
I fancied some cake.

9
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,861
Got any strawberry tarts?

10
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,863
Put them in the fridge.

11
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,164
Catch!

12
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:20,200
Mom said put them in the fridge.

13
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,236
Where the hell have you been?
Tristan was worried.

14
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:26,139
Not at all.
I just asked where he was.

15
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:30,132
We haven't finished the game.

16
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:37,250
So where's the champagne?

17
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,285
Champagne, cakes...

18
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:40,887
What are we celebrating?

19
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,689
Tristan...

20
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:44,190
Ever had sex?

21
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,892
Knock it off.

22
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,561
A first day at work
is worth celebrating.

23
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,663
For a job in a factory, maybe.

24
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:54,667
But in Daddy's shop...

25
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:56,869
Just wait till you find a job.

26
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:59,172
Yours took a lot of finding.

27
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:03,165
No preferential treatment.
Tristan works, like everyone else.

28
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,946
How come you're still up?
It's late.

29
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:10,250
- I want some champagne.
- Don't hold your breath.

30
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,885
Put your pajamas on
and say goodnight.

31
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:14,988
In a minute.

32
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:18,891
Marcel...

33
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:21,628
So how much do you pay him, Dad?

34
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:23,429
Don't tell him.

35
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,631
It's no secret.

36
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:26,699
I don't want him to know.

37
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:29,636
Really? Is that all?

38
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:33,629
Champagne, then?

39
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:06,039
- Since when?
- Never you mind.

40
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:07,373
How'd you get it?

41
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:09,776
What does it matter? You idiot!

42
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:11,778
I'm 20, and I'm a goner!

43
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:15,348
Don't say that.

44
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:19,018
HlV doesn't necessarily
kill you these days.

45
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:20,953
Where are you going?

46
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:23,990
Stay here.

47
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,983
Marcel mustn't know, agreed?

48
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:30,730
Agreed?

49
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:34,000
- Why, are you ashamed?
- That's not what he means!

50
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,969
I've never been ashamed of you.

51
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:39,038
He's too young to understand.

52
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:42,775
- When I'm dead, it'll be too late.
- Stop it!

53
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:46,768
Stop it, Leo.

54
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,422
Goodnight, Dad.

55
00:05:56,422 --> 00:06:00,415
Goodnight, darling.

56
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:04,986
- Goodnight, Tristan.
- See you tomorrow.

57
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:10,559
- Goodnight, Mom.
- Goodnight, love.

58
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:15,397
- Goodnight, Pierrot.
- Goodnight, Marcel.

59
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:49,108
What are you doing?

60
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:51,377
Getting a tan.

61
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:53,379
I'm keeping my trousers on.

62
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:57,372
Why? Are you wearing
Pokemon underpants?

63
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:17,092
What the hell's this?

64
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,619
Anyone got a smoke?

65
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,388
We just had the last one.

66
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:37,457
You mean you did!

67
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:41,450
You don't smoke?

68
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:37,239
Leo, did it sting you?

69
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:47,693
What do we do?

70
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:51,686
It'll go away.

71
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:06,167
Stop being so scared all the time.

72
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:38,033
Hello, Mrs. Shopkeeper.

73
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:43,004
With APS, you have a choice
of 3 different formats:

74
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:46,319
panoramic, large rectangle

75
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:50,312
and small rectangle.
Let me show you...

76
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:53,326
It's easy. Look...

77
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:56,329
- Excuse me, I just wanted a film.
- Marcel!

78
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,698
I didn't recognize you.

79
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:01,934
- Come on, make your mind up.
- Don't rush me.

80
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:05,037
I'll chew it over and call in again.

81
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:09,030
I'd like your father's opinion.
He knows Brigitte.

82
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:13,335
As you please, but I think
this is the one for you.

83
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:18,340
You'll soon be as big
as your brothers.

84
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:26,993
What's wrong with you?
Are you stupid?

85
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:28,861
It was just a laugh.

86
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:31,697
You just blew an 800-franc sale!

87
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:35,690
Calm down, she said she wanted
to see Dad first.

88
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:39,105
You're irresponsible, Marcel!

89
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:41,007
You'll end up like Pierrot.

90
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:41,874
Good!

91
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:44,076
As long as I don't end up like you!

92
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:48,069
A slave in Dad's shop.

93
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,915
That's easy to say.

94
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:53,819
You'll understand when you're older.

95
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:57,812
Asshole!

96
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:06,899
- What's up?
- Screw you.

97
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:10,892
Thanks!

98
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:01,954
It's only us.

99
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:03,956
What are you doing?

100
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:05,391
Waiting for you.

101
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:08,360
What do you want?
I've done nothing.

102
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,764
No need to get nasty.

103
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:15,757
Look, Pierrot and l
had something to tell you.

104
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,804
We wanted to tell you...

105
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:22,141
that some things...

106
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:26,134
Some things prevent you
from growing up.

107
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:30,182
Even for you,

108
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:34,175
things won't always be
as you want them to be.

109
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:38,813
What are you babbling about?

110
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:43,952
I need a hand here.

111
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:48,167
What Tristan means,

112
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:50,936
what he's trying to say...

113
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:54,039
is that till now,
everything's been rosy for you

114
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:57,877
but one day, there may well be...

115
00:12:57,877 --> 00:13:00,112
a disaster.

116
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:03,082
Maybe not a disaster
but something less rosy.

117
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:04,850
See?

118
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:08,843
Is that it?

119
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:13,848
Yeah.

120
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:29,809
People go to mass on Sundays.

121
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,545
That means customers.

122
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:36,538
You think they'll want to buy a film
after mass?

123
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:40,119
I reckon it'll be dead.

124
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:43,889
OK?

125
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:47,882
You should eat a bit.

126
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:51,897
People take photos
on Sunday afternoon.

127
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:55,234
Walking, picnicking,
on the beach, playing sports...

128
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:57,069
At orgies...

129
00:13:57,069 --> 00:13:58,938
Pierrot!

130
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:01,807
I don't care what
they take pictures of.

131
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:05,244
I'll gladly develop them!

132
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:09,237
Either you're a pro or you aren't!

133
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:15,588
Everyone finished?

134
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:16,922
I'll have more!

135
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:20,915
Tough luck.

136
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,863
It ain't raining.

137
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,898
Speak properly.

138
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:27,132
"lt ain't raining"?

139
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:31,125
Ain't raining!

140
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:48,153
Marcel...

141
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:51,957
- Orgy!
- Are you crazy?

142
00:14:51,957 --> 00:14:54,827
- Leave the table immediately!
- Run your bath.

143
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:58,820
It'll calm you down.

144
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:40,205
Your eyes are red.

145
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:44,198
It's the soap.

146
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:54,909
Your brothers set a bad example.

147
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:59,881
It's easy to show off
in front of someone younger.

148
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:10,591
You want to be like them
but you're younger.

149
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:15,240
You're 12.

150
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,233
You don't say "orgy" when you're 12.

151
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:27,241
Do you know what it means?

152
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:33,926
You see?

153
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:37,919
Never use words
you don't understand.

154
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:45,626
I bet Pierrot
doesn't understand it either.

155
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:48,273
He deserves a slap too.

156
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:50,275
Will you give him one?

157
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:53,278
I should.

158
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:55,647
So why don't you?

159
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:59,640
Forget about it.

160
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:06,180
Cut it out!

161
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:10,462
Here's a joke for you.

162
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:12,097
Go on.

163
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:15,267
It's disgusting but you'll like it.

164
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:18,303
What's the definition
of self-confidence?

165
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:22,296
Farting when you've got the runs.

166
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:29,137
Time to sleep.

167
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:37,145
Goodnight.

168
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:49,690
Leave the door open.

169
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:36,597
Are you awake?

170
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:44,138
Move over, Marcello.

171
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:04,425
Move over...

172
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:43,397
OK, you can get dressed.

173
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:59,981
I admit I'm not an expert
in such matters.

174
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:04,919
Leo should consult a specialist
in infectious diseases.

175
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:07,933
There's a good hospital in Brest.

176
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:11,926
Better than the one at Quimper.

177
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:15,741
They'll know how to proceed.

178
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:19,378
Whether to begin treatment
right away.

179
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:23,371
Or do nothing for the time being.

180
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:33,748
It depends on your general health.

181
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:38,986
We should keep an eye
on your swollen glands.

182
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:44,258
But that may have
nothing to do with it.

183
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:50,298
- Can you fix us an appointment?
- Of course. I'll call them.

184
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:53,645
What are you doing at the moment?

185
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:56,248
Revising.

186
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:57,683
Like my daughter.

187
00:21:57,683 --> 00:22:01,676
Exams at the end of the month.
Is it your final year?

188
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:05,023
No, first.

189
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:08,960
Will these tests take long?

190
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,331
They're all done in a day.

191
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:16,324
How about tomorrow?

192
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:23,809
I'll call them from next door.

193
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:27,802
I'll be right back...

194
00:22:57,109 --> 00:23:00,612
I'm not going.

195
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:03,615
We can't just ignore this, Leo.

196
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:05,817
Pretend it hasn't happened.

197
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:09,020
What will you do, then?
You always know best.

198
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,857
Look after you.

199
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:13,825
You regard me as a patient.

200
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:17,818
Just shut up!

201
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:33,672
So where do I stand?

202
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:35,807
I don't know.

203
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,709
Let's think about it.

204
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:39,144
If this is a drag...

205
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:43,137
No, it's not a drag.
Just tell me what to do.

206
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:49,821
We could try there, beside the tree.

207
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:51,523
What do you think?

208
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:53,458
Nothing. I'm no photographer.

209
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:57,451
Let's do it.

210
00:24:57,929 --> 00:25:01,922
Catch.

211
00:25:19,784 --> 00:25:22,187
Look up...

212
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:25,257
The other way...

213
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:29,250
Lower...

214
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:44,776
Happy?

215
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:47,679
With what?

216
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,881
To be behind the lens.

217
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:52,050
Will you do it all your life?

218
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,919
Yeah, I'd like to.

219
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,788
Why do you ask?

220
00:25:56,788 --> 00:25:58,924
It's important.

221
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:00,859
I want you to be happy.

222
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:03,962
I am. Really happy.

223
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:07,955
Well, maybe not at the moment.

224
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:17,231
You're OK, kid.

225
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:21,902
We need a veil.
I could've played the bride.

226
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:30,511
Could you lie down?

227
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:42,000
I'll try a close-up.

228
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,993
You look beautiful.

229
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:47,839
Stop it.

230
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:51,832
Really, I think you're beautiful.

231
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:56,770
You should've told me.
You said you didn't mind!

232
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:01,775
I only said you look beautiful
because you do.

233
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:06,814
What's the point in helping me?

234
00:27:07,692 --> 00:27:11,685
Idiot.

235
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,326
That's life.

236
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:45,319
No, that isn't life.

237
00:27:46,097 --> 00:27:47,766
Just the opposite.

238
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:50,168
It could have happened to any of us.

239
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:51,936
Maybe not any of us.

240
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:55,929
Being a virgin's the best way
to stay healthy.

241
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:58,043
You don't know everything.

242
00:27:58,043 --> 00:28:00,045
I'm not a virgin.

243
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:02,347
As for health...

244
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:03,848
Here's to yours.

245
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,917
Come on, Leo.

246
00:28:05,917 --> 00:28:07,352
I'm stopping.

247
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,054
You've drunk a lot.

248
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:11,389
I'm giving it up tomorrow.

249
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:14,759
No aperitifs over there.

250
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:18,752
Pack a vial of pastis
and hook it up to a drip.

251
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:21,733
You can't beat intravenous hooch.

252
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:24,069
I knew a guy who did that.

253
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:27,405
When he had no smack,
he'd shoot up rum.

254
00:28:27,405 --> 00:28:28,940
Works well, I hear.

255
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:32,043
- Some people are fucking crazy!
- Who was it?

256
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:33,745
Nobody interesting.

257
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:35,880
- Did you try it?
- Shooting up?

258
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,817
No. I knew it was bad.

259
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:42,810
Anyway I didn't like him.
His dick was too small.

260
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:49,828
Shall we hit the sack?

261
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:53,131
Are you crazy? It's my last night.
We're celebrating.

262
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:57,135
Your last night of what?

263
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:59,838
You're a pain.

264
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:01,773
Your tests won't last forever.

265
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:04,909
Hey, brothers, cool it.
I just want a bit of fun.

266
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:07,011
Sing, laugh, go for a swim.

267
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:11,004
Give us a break.

268
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:53,247
What are you doing?

269
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:57,962
How come you're swimming
without me?

270
00:29:57,962 --> 00:29:59,864
Why didn't you tell me?

271
00:29:59,864 --> 00:30:02,467
Marcel, you were asleep.

272
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:06,070
Who's swiped my trunks?

273
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:09,908
I'm sick of being excluded.
You treat me like a baby!

274
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:13,901
Don't get wound up.

275
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:32,486
The water's nice!

276
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:54,041
Come on, get a move on!

277
00:31:38,129 --> 00:31:40,932
Mom, I've got no pajamas.

278
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:44,925
Shut up!

279
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:59,373
Ave mamma!

280
00:32:00,184 --> 00:32:03,221
You know, it's 1 1 :30.

281
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:06,157
Really?

282
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:07,992
Any croissants?

283
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:11,262
Yes, but it's too late
for croissants.

284
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:14,299
Breakfast finishes at 1 1.

285
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:17,235
Oh, go on, Mom.

286
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:21,139
Lunch is in an hour, so get washed.

287
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:23,174
Where are the others?

288
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:25,109
Pierrot's still in bed,

289
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:27,979
Tristan's at the shop

290
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:29,948
and Leo's out with Dad.

291
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,249
Where did they go?

292
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:35,242
Marcel, stop pestering me!

293
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:38,990
Where's Leo?

294
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:41,326
He's gone with Dad.

295
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:43,328
To Brest.

296
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:46,998
He's going to do a course there.

297
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:49,100
That's in July.

298
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,668
This is a trial.

299
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:52,704
For how long?

300
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:55,206
I don't know. He'll be back later.

301
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:59,177
This evening.

302
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:00,912
He didn't say.

303
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:04,905
They called this morning.

304
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:09,176
Now get dressed
before you catch cold.

305
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:12,290
What's with the sheet anyway?

306
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:15,093
Did you wet the bed?

307
00:33:15,093 --> 00:33:17,261
Did you?

308
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:21,254
- Why don't you tell me the truth?
- What truth? Leo's in Brest!

309
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:32,143
Don't worry, everything's fine.

310
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:36,047
It's just that...

311
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:40,040
How about a trip to Quimper,
just me and you?

312
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:47,681
Don't mess about,
I'm not in the mood.

313
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:51,952
Want a croissant?

314
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:56,723
Here's your croissant.
Don't tell Pierrot!

315
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:05,499
- I'm running out of patience...
- Get off!

316
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:35,362
Open this door right away.

317
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:25,156
Why did you lock yourself in?

318
00:35:25,156 --> 00:35:27,191
Answer me, Marcel!

319
00:35:27,191 --> 00:35:30,061
Leave him, he'll get over it.

320
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:34,054
We're not angry, darling,
but you have to come out now.

321
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:38,336
OK?

322
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:42,329
Is that OK?

323
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:11,369
What's up?

324
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:15,362
Your Dad just called.
They're keeping Leo for a while.

325
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,377
Did they say anything?

326
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:21,913
What should I do about Marcel?

327
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:25,850
He hasn't come out?

328
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,252
What do I say?

329
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:30,588
Don't say anything.

330
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:33,424
He'll come out.

331
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:37,417
Yes... he'll come out.

332
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:48,139
Marcel!

333
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:52,132
It's for you.

334
00:37:01,686 --> 00:37:05,223
Did you bring your toothbrush?

335
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,424
You OK?

336
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:09,961
Yvan!

337
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:13,954
Thanks.

338
00:37:15,299 --> 00:37:19,292
Hi.

339
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:22,206
Is your mother on antidepressants?

340
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:23,641
Why do you ask?

341
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:25,643
She never usually invites me.

342
00:37:25,643 --> 00:37:28,379
It was your Mom's idea.

343
00:37:28,379 --> 00:37:29,647
Mine?

344
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:31,582
She wanted you to come.

345
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:33,451
But you called.

346
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:37,444
But your Mom called here first.

347
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:50,991
Stupid bitch.

348
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:07,718
Can I tell you a secret?

349
00:38:07,718 --> 00:38:11,711
A real one.
You must never repeat it.

350
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:14,392
What?

351
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:15,726
Swear first.

352
00:38:15,726 --> 00:38:17,261
I swear. Go on.

353
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:18,696
Swear on what?

354
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:21,265
On your life.

355
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:24,402
Stop it, this is deadly serious.

356
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:27,605
OK, I swear on my mother's life.

357
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:31,598
- Were your fingers crossed?
- No, come on!

358
00:38:32,376 --> 00:38:36,369
It's Leo.

359
00:38:37,281 --> 00:38:39,350
Not Leo. Me.

360
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:43,343
You're bullshitting me.

361
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:46,791
I smashed the neon lights
in the library.

362
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:48,059
Why?

363
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:49,694
It was an attack.

364
00:38:49,694 --> 00:38:50,995
What?

365
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:54,365
You know, an attack.

366
00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:56,434
Did anyone see you?

367
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:58,769
No, I don't think so.

368
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:00,604
It was serious, then.

369
00:39:00,604 --> 00:39:04,597
It was a serious attack.
I could go to jail.

370
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:33,037
I'll never manage it.

371
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:34,839
Never mind. Forget it.

372
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:37,475
No, I have to do it. Like you.

373
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:39,643
We don't have to attack every day.

374
00:39:39,643 --> 00:39:43,636
Shut up!

375
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:09,662
What are you doing?
Come back!

376
00:40:30,394 --> 00:40:32,363
What shall we do with it?

377
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:36,356
Bury it.

378
00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:41,394
Can't we chuck it in the container?

379
00:40:45,709 --> 00:40:47,711
Chickens have a soul too.

380
00:40:47,711 --> 00:40:50,714
If you don't respect its memory,

381
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:54,707
its soul will haunt you
all your life.

382
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:03,850
Wait!

383
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:08,132
Now grab the head.

384
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,500
Sure?

385
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:13,493
Never seen any voodoo?

386
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:19,143
Suck the blood and say,
"I'll never forget."

387
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,744
You too?

388
00:41:20,744 --> 00:41:24,737
No, I didn't kill it.
That would be sacrilege.

389
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:30,743
"l shall remain on earth
to honor your memory.

390
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,557
I swear your life
won't have been in vain."

391
00:41:33,557 --> 00:41:37,550
I shall remain on earth
to honor your memory.

392
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:42,466
I swear your life
won't have been in vain.

393
00:41:42,466 --> 00:41:43,767
Now bury it.

394
00:41:43,767 --> 00:41:47,760
Can I let go of the head?

395
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:23,474
Is that the florist?

396
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:24,842
How may I help you?

397
00:42:24,842 --> 00:42:26,844
I'd like to send flowers.

398
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:28,479
To your mother?

399
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,814
That's right. It's her birthday.

400
00:42:30,814 --> 00:42:33,484
That's a nice gesture.

401
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:35,819
Where are they to be sent?

402
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:39,812
Up your ass!

403
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:46,530
Let's do another one.

404
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:50,234
I love that. "Up your ass!"

405
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:53,270
It's my turn.

406
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:56,574
Let me choose.

407
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:59,543
" Adofil, teenagers' helpline.

408
00:42:59,543 --> 00:43:02,313
Friendship, love, health.
All questions answered."

409
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:03,714
What's the number?

410
00:43:03,714 --> 00:43:07,707
What will you ask them?

411
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:16,749
Are you the telephone prankster?

412
00:43:16,794 --> 00:43:19,930
Because I really
don't find it funny.

413
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:23,923
And Iet me tell you,
I won't put up with it...

414
00:43:28,872 --> 00:43:31,976
It's not funny.
You don't say that to a florist.

415
00:43:31,976 --> 00:43:35,969
Or anyone, for that matter.

416
00:43:41,885 --> 00:43:44,888
I thought you'd grown up a bit.

417
00:43:44,888 --> 00:43:48,881
But no, you're babies.
Rude babies at that.

418
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:55,933
Don't start looking all tragic.

419
00:43:55,933 --> 00:43:59,036
It's too late.

420
00:43:59,036 --> 00:44:00,804
I'm disappointed in you.

421
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:04,797
I thought you were
more sensible than Yvan.

422
00:44:07,778 --> 00:44:09,780
Will you tell my Mom?

423
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:13,350
I don't need your Mom.
This is between you and me.

424
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:17,343
Tell her if you like. I don't care.

425
00:44:18,022 --> 00:44:21,925
No.

426
00:44:21,925 --> 00:44:24,728
I want you to tell her.

427
00:44:24,728 --> 00:44:26,930
That's enough, Marcel.

428
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:30,923
Eat up.
Let's hear no more about it.

429
00:44:35,806 --> 00:44:37,074
What are you doing?

430
00:44:37,074 --> 00:44:39,009
I want my mother to know.

431
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:43,002
Sit down.

432
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:09,362
It'll go away.

433
00:45:34,832 --> 00:45:36,200
Can't you sleep?

434
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,068
I just wanted some water.

435
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:42,061
Be quick, then.

436
00:45:51,148 --> 00:45:52,449
Goodnight.

437
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:56,153
Goodnight, Marcel.

438
00:45:56,153 --> 00:45:58,989
What's wrong?

439
00:45:58,989 --> 00:46:01,158
Tell me.

440
00:46:01,158 --> 00:46:02,893
Leo's going to die.

441
00:46:02,893 --> 00:46:06,886
Stop it, you mustn't say that.

442
00:46:06,964 --> 00:46:09,900
It has to be said. He has AlDS.

443
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,168
He's going to die.

444
00:46:11,168 --> 00:46:12,936
Who told you that?

445
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:16,929
I bet my mother told you.
She didn't tell me.

446
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:19,443
Everyone knows.

447
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:21,211
She will tell you.

448
00:46:21,211 --> 00:46:23,447
Some things are hard to say.

449
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:27,050
Don't say Leo's going to die.
People don't just die.

450
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:31,043
It's a serious illness
but there are drugs now.

451
00:46:31,822 --> 00:46:33,090
Come on.

452
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:37,083
Come here.

453
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:43,133
My brother isn't gay.

454
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:47,126
That isn't important.

455
00:46:47,237 --> 00:46:48,272
Is he gay?

456
00:46:48,272 --> 00:46:51,275
Well? Are you?

457
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:54,011
Have you got a girlfriend?

458
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:57,781
You won't say?
You think it's none of my business?

459
00:46:57,781 --> 00:47:01,774
Well, Leo's private life
is none of yours.

460
00:47:02,052 --> 00:47:04,054
Anyway, I know he's gay.

461
00:47:04,054 --> 00:47:08,047
You're so nosy!

462
00:47:10,027 --> 00:47:14,020
Can you keep a secret?

463
00:47:14,097 --> 00:47:17,968
Not even Yvan knows this.

464
00:47:17,968 --> 00:47:20,170
We're in the same boat.

465
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:24,107
Your brother is sick,
so is my mother.

466
00:47:24,107 --> 00:47:27,344
She's sick?

467
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:30,113
But she's older, so it's different.

468
00:47:30,113 --> 00:47:34,106
It's more common.

469
00:47:41,091 --> 00:47:43,360
You wouldn't be falling asleep...

470
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:47,353
I think so.

471
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:52,859
Aren't you sleepy?

472
00:47:58,242 --> 00:48:02,235
Take me up...

473
00:48:30,274 --> 00:48:33,076
Let's go.

474
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:35,312
Don't I have to sign anything?

475
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:39,305
I signed it. I'm over 18.

476
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:42,986
I wanted to talk to a doctor.

477
00:48:42,986 --> 00:48:44,154
What did they say?

478
00:48:44,154 --> 00:48:48,147
They said I've got AlDS.
Do you need details?

479
00:48:49,893 --> 00:48:53,886
Yes, I want some details.

480
00:48:55,332 --> 00:48:58,902
Primary infection.
I'm on a four-way treatment.

481
00:48:58,902 --> 00:49:02,005
It adds up to more than
15 pills a day.

482
00:49:02,005 --> 00:49:05,998
Will that do? Or do you want
the names of the drugs?

483
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:13,216
Sorry.

484
00:49:13,216 --> 00:49:15,118
I'm sorry.

485
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:19,111
Can we go now?

486
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:50,047
I'm going away for a while.

487
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:51,982
Where to?

488
00:50:51,982 --> 00:50:54,184
Don't ask.

489
00:50:54,184 --> 00:50:56,987
I have to see someone.

490
00:50:56,987 --> 00:51:00,724
And I need to think.

491
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:03,760
I'll take a few days off
and take you, if you like.

492
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:07,753
That's nice of you, but no.

493
00:51:12,135 --> 00:51:16,128
You can't go away on your own.

494
00:51:24,147 --> 00:51:27,117
Let's go.

495
00:51:27,117 --> 00:51:31,110
I want to get home.

496
00:51:32,289 --> 00:51:33,590
Are you OK?

497
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:34,825
Yeah, I won.

498
00:51:34,825 --> 00:51:38,228
No. First to get a kiss off Mom.

499
00:51:38,228 --> 00:51:42,065
- Kiss me!
- Kiss me!

500
00:51:42,065 --> 00:51:43,200
I won't!

501
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,235
It's too late now.

502
00:51:45,235 --> 00:51:48,605
- Have you got your toothbrush?
- Give me a break!

503
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:52,598
Where are you going?

504
00:51:52,843 --> 00:51:54,177
Don't worry.

505
00:51:54,177 --> 00:51:58,170
I'll call you.
We'll be back in a few days.

506
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:04,143
It's not like I'm going to camp!

507
00:53:14,157 --> 00:53:18,150
Is that you, dear?

508
00:53:22,332 --> 00:53:26,325
I'm here, Mom.

509
00:53:27,604 --> 00:53:31,597
When am I ever not here?

510
00:53:52,195 --> 00:53:54,364
Careful, it's hot.

511
00:53:54,364 --> 00:53:55,665
I don't want any.

512
00:53:55,665 --> 00:53:57,734
Oh, stop it.

513
00:53:57,734 --> 00:54:01,204
So who's this guy?

514
00:54:01,204 --> 00:54:03,940
A friend.
It doesn't concern you.

515
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:06,710
Then why bring me along?

516
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:09,646
It's nice to be together.
I'm glad you're here.

517
00:54:09,646 --> 00:54:11,448
Tell me who it is.

518
00:54:11,448 --> 00:54:15,352
It doesn't matter.
We're just going to say hello.

519
00:54:15,352 --> 00:54:17,354
We're on holiday.

520
00:54:17,354 --> 00:54:21,347
You're so full of it!

521
00:54:22,959 --> 00:54:26,952
Anyway, I didn't want
any hot chocolate.

522
00:54:35,972 --> 00:54:39,965
Did you bring any tapes?

523
00:54:42,646 --> 00:54:45,649
We can't sing all the way there.

524
00:54:45,649 --> 00:54:47,984
We can?

525
00:54:47,984 --> 00:54:51,977
I warn you, you won't know
the songs I know.

526
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:51,704
Marcel sends his love.

527
00:55:57,087 --> 00:56:01,080
If you're going to sulk
we'll go straight back to Brittany.

528
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:05,762
I thought you liked Paris.

529
00:56:05,762 --> 00:56:09,755
So why did you want to come?

530
00:56:11,768 --> 00:56:15,472
Driving for 5 hours
in total silence is no fun.

531
00:56:15,472 --> 00:56:19,409
Until I'm told the truth,
my lips are sealed.

532
00:56:19,409 --> 00:56:23,402
What truth? It's just a pal.
Stop going on about it.

533
00:56:24,647 --> 00:56:28,640
You're ill.

534
00:56:28,918 --> 00:56:32,911
Who told you that?

535
00:56:39,362 --> 00:56:43,355
Don't cry.

536
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:47,103
There's no point in being sad.

537
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:49,139
I'm ill, that's all.

538
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:52,942
Let's change the subject.
I'm sick, but I'm still here.

539
00:56:52,942 --> 00:56:54,811
I don't want you to be ill.

540
00:56:54,811 --> 00:56:56,880
I know.

541
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:00,383
Me neither.
I'm doing my best.

542
00:57:00,383 --> 00:57:03,653
Why didn't you tell me?

543
00:57:03,653 --> 00:57:07,646
You're too young.

544
00:57:08,391 --> 00:57:11,795
All right...

545
00:57:11,795 --> 00:57:13,830
I'm...

546
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:16,866
I'm really ill...

547
00:57:16,866 --> 00:57:20,859
And I'm really gay.
Great, huh?

548
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:35,774
- lsn't the Eiffel Tower great?
- That's not the Eiffel Tower!

549
00:57:36,853 --> 00:57:39,756
Don't cry.

550
00:57:39,756 --> 00:57:43,749
I'm not crying,
you're suffocating me!

551
00:57:48,865 --> 00:57:52,858
Let's go get a crepe...

552
00:58:35,945 --> 00:58:38,815
Sure, the Breton cause
has attacked targets

553
00:58:38,815 --> 00:58:42,808
but only ever property,
rarely are there any victims.

554
00:58:43,486 --> 00:58:47,457
It has happened, though.
There are always accidents.

555
00:58:47,457 --> 00:58:50,493
Would you carry out an attack?

556
00:58:50,493 --> 00:58:51,794
Yes.

557
00:58:51,794 --> 00:58:54,831
But I've never infiltrated
any groups.

558
00:58:54,831 --> 00:58:55,932
It's stupid.

559
00:58:55,932 --> 00:58:58,801
You're right. I have to infiltrate.

560
00:58:58,801 --> 00:59:02,794
Finisterian - always.
Breton - maybe. French - never!

561
00:59:03,273 --> 00:59:07,266
Why didn't you tell me before?

562
00:59:07,744 --> 00:59:09,779
I don't know.

563
00:59:09,779 --> 00:59:12,782
We were afraid it'd upset you.

564
00:59:12,782 --> 00:59:14,684
We wanted you to be happy.

565
00:59:14,684 --> 00:59:17,954
I'm going to be unhappy?

566
00:59:17,954 --> 00:59:21,024
I hope not.
You're not going to be unhappy.

567
00:59:21,024 --> 00:59:25,017
Are you unhappy?

568
00:59:25,261 --> 00:59:27,530
I love you.

569
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:31,523
Fuck you!

570
00:59:32,969 --> 00:59:36,962
Is it ready?

571
00:59:45,715 --> 00:59:48,017
So what's the name of this guy?

572
00:59:48,017 --> 00:59:49,118
Aymeric.

573
00:59:49,118 --> 00:59:53,111
Lousy name.

574
01:00:15,311 --> 01:00:18,581
It's raining buckets
on the genius of Iiberty

575
01:00:18,581 --> 01:00:22,018
Of the PIace de Ia Bastille

576
01:00:22,018 --> 01:00:25,321
We walk beneath a grey sky

577
01:00:25,321 --> 01:00:29,314
Soothed by thousands of needles...

578
01:01:31,087 --> 01:01:35,080
Excuse us.

579
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:41,153
- Which room is it again?
- 1 01.

580
01:02:16,165 --> 01:02:20,158
"Active ingredients... "

581
01:02:20,837 --> 01:02:23,239
"Excipients... "

582
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:26,876
"Microcrystalline cellulose... "

583
01:02:26,876 --> 01:02:29,278
"Sodium starch glycolate... "

584
01:02:29,278 --> 01:02:32,181
"Magnesium stearate... "

585
01:02:32,181 --> 01:02:36,174
"Methyl hydroxypropyl cellulose... "

586
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:40,245
"Titanium dioxide... "

587
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:47,096
What are you doi ng?

588
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:51,089
Shall we get ready?
I ' ll take you out.

589
01:03:17,059 --> 01:03:19,195
- You need them.
- I need to be "not sick"'.

590
01:03:19,195 --> 01:03:20,263
OK? Not sick.

591
01:03:20,263 --> 01:03:22,031
But the drugs work.

592
01:03:22,031 --> 01:03:26,024
Don't lecture me. Help me.

593
01:03:34,110 --> 01:03:37,914
Spit them out!

594
01:03:37,914 --> 01:03:40,082
Are you nuts?

595
01:03:40,082 --> 01:03:42,018
I hate you!

596
01:03:42,018 --> 01:03:46,011
Go ahead and die. I hate you.

597
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:01,793
Come here.

598
01:05:15,111 --> 01:05:18,147
OK?

599
01:05:18,147 --> 01:05:22,140
Yeah.

600
01:05:28,357 --> 01:05:30,192
Let's go.

601
01:05:30,192 --> 01:05:34,185
In a moment.

602
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:12,223
Stay there, and don't mess around.

603
01:06:15,671 --> 01:06:18,307
What can I get you?

604
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:20,910
Actually I'm looking for Aymeric.

605
01:06:20,910 --> 01:06:24,380
He'll be back after classes
this afternoon.

606
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:27,383
Thanks. Goodbye.

607
01:06:27,383 --> 01:06:31,376
He's not here?

608
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:38,984
I'll read it out loud
but you mustn't laugh.

609
01:06:42,131 --> 01:06:45,935
"Every evening I recite your words.

610
01:06:45,935 --> 01:06:48,237
"For me,
repeating the words you said

611
01:06:48,237 --> 01:06:51,240
"feels like rubbing stones
in your pocket.

612
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:53,442
"Your words have become secrets,

613
01:06:53,442 --> 01:06:56,979
"Rabbits' feet. Good-luck charms.

614
01:06:56,979 --> 01:06:59,248
"You bring me good luck.

615
01:06:59,248 --> 01:07:01,984
"Not only do I recite your words.

616
01:07:01,984 --> 01:07:04,553
"l know your body by heart too.

617
01:07:04,553 --> 01:07:06,722
"Leo's little body.

618
01:07:06,722 --> 01:07:10,159
"Your little eyes,
your little mouth,

619
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:13,329
"your little...

620
01:07:13,329 --> 01:07:15,131
"and your knees."

621
01:07:15,131 --> 01:07:18,734
"l never expected to fall in love
with someone's knees."

622
01:07:18,734 --> 01:07:21,404
Aymeric sounds a bit stupid.

623
01:07:21,404 --> 01:07:25,241
Speak for yourself.

624
01:07:25,241 --> 01:07:27,176
- Are your knees nice?
- Not really.

625
01:07:27,176 --> 01:07:28,544
Let's see them!

626
01:07:28,544 --> 01:07:29,745
Cut it out!

627
01:07:29,745 --> 01:07:33,738
Let's see!

628
01:07:35,584 --> 01:07:39,321
They're nothing special.

629
01:07:39,321 --> 01:07:40,356
Nice, huh?

630
01:07:40,356 --> 01:07:43,325
- What's special about them?
- Nothing.

631
01:07:43,325 --> 01:07:44,360
And the other?

632
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:46,162
Same.

633
01:07:46,162 --> 01:07:49,198
Let's compare them.

634
01:07:49,198 --> 01:07:52,368
This one's redder.
I was expecting better.

635
01:07:52,368 --> 01:07:54,804
No, it's fine.

636
01:07:54,804 --> 01:07:57,306
Mine are nice.

637
01:07:57,306 --> 01:08:00,209
Yours have a funny bone.

638
01:08:00,209 --> 01:08:02,078
It's weird.

639
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:05,147
Ready?

640
01:08:05,147 --> 01:08:06,215
Are you?

641
01:08:06,215 --> 01:08:09,218
Go on, do my hair.

642
01:08:09,218 --> 01:08:10,553
Do I look good?

643
01:08:10,553 --> 01:08:14,546
Like a prince!

644
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:27,192
Go and play.

645
01:08:42,351 --> 01:08:44,587
What are you doing here?

646
01:08:44,587 --> 01:08:47,056
I dropped by to say hello.

647
01:08:47,056 --> 01:08:50,259
Hello.

648
01:08:50,259 --> 01:08:52,595
So what brings you to Paris?

649
01:08:52,595 --> 01:08:56,588
Like I said, I came to say hello.

650
01:08:57,266 --> 01:09:01,237
What will you have?

651
01:09:01,237 --> 01:09:05,141
Martini.

652
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:07,443
And a Coke.

653
01:09:07,443 --> 01:09:09,845
For my brother.

654
01:09:09,845 --> 01:09:11,680
The kid over there?

655
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:15,673
Marcel.

656
01:09:23,459 --> 01:09:25,628
Can we talk?

657
01:09:25,628 --> 01:09:29,621
- It's a bad time.
- Just for 5 minutes.

658
01:09:39,275 --> 01:09:41,310
Are you with anyone?

659
01:09:41,310 --> 01:09:43,646
Not now, Leo.

660
01:09:43,646 --> 01:09:46,115
Then you are.

661
01:09:46,115 --> 01:09:49,118
Why?
Should I have waited for you?

662
01:09:49,118 --> 01:09:52,388
Well, yeah.

663
01:09:52,388 --> 01:09:55,691
We've been through that.

664
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:58,327
Something's happened.

665
01:09:58,327 --> 01:10:02,298
I don't want to know. Don't bug me.
It's no concern of mine.

666
01:10:02,298 --> 01:10:06,291
I know.
But I needed to talk to someone.

667
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:09,338
Talk about what?

668
01:10:09,338 --> 01:10:11,340
Can't you take a 5-minute break?

669
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:13,676
What are you after?

670
01:10:13,676 --> 01:10:15,711
You haven't called for a year.

671
01:10:15,711 --> 01:10:18,447
You don't answer my letters.

672
01:10:18,447 --> 01:10:20,916
You left me, remember?

673
01:10:20,916 --> 01:10:23,919
You turn up
and expect me to drop everything.

674
01:10:23,919 --> 01:10:27,912
I'm not available.
It's over between us.

675
01:10:30,926 --> 01:10:34,930
I love you.

676
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:38,923
You'd better leave.

677
01:10:46,542 --> 01:10:50,535
We're leaving.

678
01:12:24,273 --> 01:12:28,266
Telephone.

679
01:12:30,779 --> 01:12:32,681
Anything else to drink?

680
01:12:32,681 --> 01:12:36,674
Not if you want something cold.

681
01:12:37,086 --> 01:12:40,522
- No alcohol?
- It's against the rules.

682
01:12:40,522 --> 01:12:42,458
"Against the rules"?

683
01:12:42,458 --> 01:12:44,793
So there may be some around?

684
01:12:44,793 --> 01:12:47,363
We'll have to go through there.

685
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:51,356
That way?

686
01:15:49,912 --> 01:15:51,246
- Wait...
- No.

687
01:15:51,246 --> 01:15:55,239
You're in a hurry.

688
01:16:30,319 --> 01:16:34,122
What are you doing?

689
01:16:34,122 --> 01:16:37,125
Sorry.

690
01:16:37,125 --> 01:16:39,828
What's wrong?

691
01:16:39,828 --> 01:16:41,830
I'd better go.

692
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:43,932
No, stay.

693
01:16:43,932 --> 01:16:47,002
Sorry, I'm going.

694
01:16:47,002 --> 01:16:50,995
You're hard to figure out.

695
01:16:51,306 --> 01:16:52,774
Something wrong?

696
01:16:52,774 --> 01:16:56,767
No, it's me.

697
01:17:05,754 --> 01:17:09,747
Are you OK?

698
01:17:11,593 --> 01:17:13,595
- Let's have a drink.
- I can't.

699
01:17:13,595 --> 01:17:17,588
Come on, don't just leave.

700
01:17:22,137 --> 01:17:25,774
Have a drink with me.

701
01:17:25,774 --> 01:17:29,767
Have a drink with me...

702
01:18:31,807 --> 01:18:34,776
Time to get up.

703
01:18:34,776 --> 01:18:36,211
We're off.

704
01:18:36,211 --> 01:18:38,146
Where to?

705
01:18:38,146 --> 01:18:40,916
You're taking the train home.

706
01:18:40,916 --> 01:18:42,150
Without you?

707
01:18:42,150 --> 01:18:45,087
I've got things to do.
Come on, we're late.

708
01:18:45,087 --> 01:18:46,421
Not unless you come.

709
01:18:46,421 --> 01:18:49,024
You have no say in the matter!

710
01:18:49,024 --> 01:18:53,017
Get dressed and get up!

711
01:19:26,795 --> 01:19:30,788
Hurry, or you'll miss it.

712
01:19:33,201 --> 01:19:37,194
It's a smoking car.
Got your ciggies?

713
01:19:39,975 --> 01:19:43,968
Marcel... wait!

714
01:19:50,919 --> 01:19:54,156
Goodbye, then.

715
01:19:54,156 --> 01:19:58,149
- Shall I get on?
- I can manage without your help.

716
01:20:46,908 --> 01:20:50,901
Do I get a kiss?

717
01:20:55,016 --> 01:20:59,009
Give me a kiss.

718
01:21:04,292 --> 01:21:08,285
I'm counting on you.

719
01:21:09,297 --> 01:21:13,290
Shake things up a bit at home.

720
01:21:18,273 --> 01:21:21,176
Make them get on with it.

721
01:21:21,176 --> 01:21:25,169
Don't let it get them down!

722
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:56,133
Can you spare a ciggie?

723
01:22:08,189 --> 01:22:09,891
It's my first ever.

724
01:22:09,891 --> 01:22:11,393
You'll always remember me.

725
01:22:11,393 --> 01:22:15,386
Yeah.

726
01:23:16,257 --> 01:23:20,250
How about this?

727
01:24:32,133 --> 01:24:36,126
I can't do it!

728
01:25:14,309 --> 01:25:16,611
Are you buying?

729
01:25:16,611 --> 01:25:18,179
No, it's OK.

730
01:25:18,179 --> 01:25:22,172
You're mad, you've got two stations.

731
01:25:27,255 --> 01:25:31,248
OK, Marcel?

732
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:41,870
I get 20,000.

733
01:25:41,870 --> 01:25:45,173
20,000!

734
01:25:45,173 --> 01:25:49,166
Just going to the bog.
