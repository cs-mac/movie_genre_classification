1
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,800
Thanks, Cuma.

2
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,640
Thanks, Cuma.

3
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,240
She's a bit shy but...

4
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,040
Really?
She's very cute.

5
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,800
See you then.

6
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:49,200
Don't run away, Kado!
Don't run away!

7
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,280
What the hell are you doing
with pansies like that?

8
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,680
Who was that guy?

9
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,400
Where did you find that queen?

10
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,560
There's no place for pansies
in our family!

11
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:43,280
Get up!
Move it!

12
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,960
Move it!

13
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,680
Mamo! How come you dumped this stu_?
Where did you go?

14
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,280
Kado must never leave this room.

15
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,000
l caught him outside
with a bunch of pansies.

16
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,040
He'll end up making a murderer of me.

17
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:05,120
l don't understand that boy.

18
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,480
Dad?

19
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,240
Yes.

20
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,560
l don't trust these guys at all.

21
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,920
Captain! Come on!
They should get ready!

22
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,080
Come on! Get ready!
We're going ashore. Move!

23
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:17,720
Necip! Flash the light.

24
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,240
Do it again!

25
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:43,080
Come on! Move!

26
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:54,240
That's it from us.

27
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,640
There's a new life waiting for you.

28
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:02,600
Good luck and all the best to you.

29
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:06,640
Close her up now! Come on!
There we go.

30
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:18,040
Ramo, if they operate on me,
who will look after the kids?

31
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,040
l will. Don't worry.
Just get yourself well.

32
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:36,560
Ramo... If it weren't for Serhat,
would you have taken a second wife?

33
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,880
Mother of my kids! Sunshine of my life!

34
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,360
l have eyes for nobody but you.

35
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:10,840
Mum, we're going out to play.
Should Zelal come with us?

36
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:13,960
OK. But keep close to the house.

37
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,840
All right, mum.

38
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:16,240
Slow down, girls.

39
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,480
Havar, it's your operation today.
Stop working. Come on. Let's go.

40
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:22,400
OK.

41
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,680
Take good care of the kids.

42
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,520
OK, Havar.

43
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,520
Doctor, l entrust my wife
first to God, then to you.

44
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,240
Don't worry, Ramazan Bey.

45
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,960
Open the door! Open the door!
Open the door!

46
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,840
We're going to die in here!
Open the door!

47
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:37,840
Come on, you bastards!
Open the door!

48
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:41,640
We're about to su_ocate!

49
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,200
Delal...

50
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:56,440
You're a big girl now.

51
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,680
You're 1 1.

52
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,560
You're the mother in this house
until your mum gets back.

53
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:08,720
OK, niece?

54
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:09,680
OK.

55
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,280
Lori Lori Lori...

56
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,520
You said 30 minutes
and it's been an hour!

57
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:48,559
Look, my uncle wouldn't lie.
He's coming for sure.

58
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,040
Something must have
happened on the way.

59
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:01,760
We're running late, my friend.

60
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:03,200
Look, he'll be here soon enough!

61
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,080
- Isn't he here yet, son?
- No.

62
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,000
ls this Nomay?

63
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:15,680
No, it's Denmark.
Uncle Nedim is taking us to Nomay.

64
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,320
- Where on earth is he?
- He's not here yet, dad. Honestly.

65
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,400
Hey! Uncle Nedim's here!

66
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,120
Welcome, nephew!

67
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,600
Where have you been, Nedim?

68
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:31,760
Welcome, Davut. Welcome!

69
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:37,800
That's it from us then.

70
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,320
- Goodbye.
- Thanks.

71
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,280
Dad, l'll get the bags.

72
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,600
OK, son.

73
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,720
Nephew...

74
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,680
Welcome, uncle.

75
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:08,160
Nedim, thatjourney did us in.

76
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,480
We came all that way
and there wasn't one police search!

77
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:18,520
That's because Schengen countries
have lifted their borders.

78
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:23,800
ln other words, everyone is free
to go to any country they want.

79
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:27,040
What?
Are you serious, Nedim?

80
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:31,080
We'd get searched a dozen times
just going from the village into town.

81
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,320
Uncle, what are those whirly things
in the water there?

82
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,080
They convert wind energy
into electricity.

83
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,640
So Davut, what's new back home?

84
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:50,480
Nothing but poverty.
Nothing but fighting and bloodshed.

85
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:50,519
Well, if the guys at the
top are always fighting...

86
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:58,280
...you can't expect the
people to live in peace.

87
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,520
There used to be a saying, remember?

88
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:03,880
lf the imam farts,
what can the congregation do?

89
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:04,840
Yes.

90
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:06,920
The guys at the top are only worried
about their seats in parliament.

91
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,640
What have the people
who die in Turkey done wrong?

92
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,120
Some 40 to 45,OOO people have died.

93
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,920
Who are these people
for goodness sake?

94
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,840
We're the people who die.
And we're the people that kill.

95
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,040
You know, l've given up hope, Nedim.

96
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:30,400
Whatever l say, no one can understand
without living there.

97
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:34,000
Don't l know it, Davut?

98
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:34,039
Where else has there been
torture like the torture we faced...

99
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:41,320
...in DiyarbakIrjail back in 1980?

100
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,280
The day l ran from the fascist coup
l was 26.

101
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,600
lt's easy to say
but that was 28 years ago.

102
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,600
And nothing has changed.

103
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,600
lt won't change either.

104
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:03,600
As long as those imperialist countries
continue acting as they do...

105
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:03,639
...as long as people keep
making money out of war...

106
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:08,680
...nothing will change,
nor will the war ever end.

107
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:14,840
No one thinks of the mothers
or the fathers.

108
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:17,040
God damn them all!

109
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:22,920
My handsome son...

110
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:31,200
Delal, if Serhat cries,
give him his dummy.

111
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,560
Dad, l know how to make his food.

112
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,640
Good for you, my love.

113
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:38,480
Delal, don't go out whatever you do.

114
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:42,520
lf you get bored, turn on the TV.
OK?

115
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:43,400
OK.

116
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,360
OK, l'm going.

117
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,800
Come home early, dad.

118
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,560
OK.

119
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,880
Come on, dad.
Mamo, we're leaving.

120
00:12:57,919 --> 00:12:59,400
l'll be right there.

121
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,200
Kado, keep an eye on the kids!

122
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,240
Fuck it!
You miserable shit!

123
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:12,040
Wow, uncle.
Those mountains are so beautiful.

124
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,000
Could they ever take the place
of our snowy mountains?

125
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,960
You like it, nephew?

126
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,880
Yes, a lot, uncle.

127
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,680
There, Nomay's fjords for you...

128
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,960
Don't stay another minute.
Leave the house right now!

129
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,920
Please go away!
Don't let them see you.

130
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,840
Carry on like this
and you'll ruin your life.

131
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:49,920
They'll kill you.

132
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:53,920
Look, you have my number, right?
Call whenever you need to. OK?

133
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:56,240
My brother will kill me
if he finds out l've seen you.

134
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:57,360
Please go!

135
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:58,920
We're not in the backwoods here!
Call me!

136
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:01,840
Uncle, why is this milk all thick?

137
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,120
Give it here. It's gone o_.

138
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,040
What are you doing there?
It's not a toy.

139
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,960
lt's like this 300 days out of 365.
Overcast and rainy.

140
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,080
People here miss the sun.

141
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,200
You rarely ever see the sun here.

142
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:39,480
'Politi'.

143
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:39,600
What?

144
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:42,880
The police. The police.
Don't be alarmed, Davut.

145
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:51,200
Look, thousands of villages
in the region have been evacuated.

146
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:51,240
Hundreds of thousands of people
have been forced to migrate.

147
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:54,560
Try to understand these people.

148
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:59,880
That's Turkey's problem.
There's nothing we can do.

149
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:01,960
We'll have to send you to Oslo.

150
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:52,600
Go and see Cuma, son.
Ask him for help.

151
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,320
Go to the police station.
Do something.

152
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:02,520
OK, dad.

153
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,880
ButterFlies.
That's what we are.

154
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,760
Life is a tightrope for us.

155
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,000
You turn one way,
Iose your footing and whoops...!

156
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,680
You find yourself o_ the bridge.

157
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,320
Don't be a bug or a butterFly.

158
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,280
Get yourself a properjob.

159
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:25,200
l can't work.
l'm not like my brothers.

160
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,360
l've killed the man inside me.

161
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:31,000
Ooh! There's a man in there?!
Where?

162
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,320
Bring him out!
l want to see him!

163
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:36,960
Tansu...
Don't be a bitch!

164
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:41,000
You must earn your own living
like everyone else, girl.

165
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,760
What did you call me?

166
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:46,079
l called you ''girl''.

167
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,680
Hey! Where on earth
did you find this newbie?

168
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:55,480
Dad, didn't mum send
us any messages?

169
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,000
Of course she did!

170
00:17:58,039 --> 00:17:59,120
What did she say, dad?

171
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,600
You know what she said?

172
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,640
Say hello to all my little doves.
And tell them l really miss them.

173
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:08,160
Dad, take us to the hospital too.

174
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,240
To the hospital?

175
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,880
When your mum's a bit better, my love,
l'm going to take you all!

176
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:19,240
The children won't sit still, son.
They're in tears all the time.

177
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:19,279
Don't run around, my love.
Don't make grandpa angry, OK?

178
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,000
Come on, Ramo. We'll be late.

179
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:24,039
Son, check again
with the police station.

180
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,640
OK, dad.
See you this evening.

181
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,960
Twenty horse mackerel...

182
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:45,520
And eight bonito.

183
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,320
Delal, let's go and play.

184
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:01,680
OK. Sure.

185
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:05,160
Sweet Serhat.

186
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,640
My beautiful baby.

187
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:32,400
Zelal, Serhat's pooed in his nappy.
Shall we give him a wash?

188
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,720
Don't cry, Serhat.

189
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,440
You'll soon be clean, sweet Serhat.

190
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,240
Don't cry, Serhat.

191
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,800
Come, Come.
Open the door!

192
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:18,920
ln the name of God...

193
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:23,120
What's going on, children?

194
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,720
Why have you got the
machine working?

195
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,400
Grandpa, we put Serhat in the
machine to wash him.

196
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,760
What?!
You put him in the machine?

197
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:47,680
Take him out! Take him out!
Delal!

198
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,120
Hazal!

199
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:12,640
We can't accept
everyone who comes here.

200
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,160
We're going to have to deport you.

201
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,160
lt was so very hard
for us to come all this way.

202
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:26,000
Please don't.
Don't send us back.

203
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,600
We have to send you back.

204
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,960
There's no alternative.

205
00:22:41,559 --> 00:22:43,880
Sir, can you describe
how the incident happened?

206
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:49,080
We've been caught
bemeen the mo sides for 25 years.

207
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:52,400
Even my own children are divided.

208
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:53,920
One joined the guerrillas and
took to the mountains.

209
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,120
The other is a soldier.

210
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,480
Our situation speaks for itself.

211
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,360
Why did you come to Nomay?

212
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:07,880
Where we lived used to be the
most beautiful place on earth.

213
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,920
But they turned it into a living hell.

214
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,720
l lost the son
who became a guerrilla.

215
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,280
Do you know what it means
to lose a son?

216
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:32,040
What cause can be more
important than human life?

217
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:36,200
What war can be greater than peace?

218
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:38,359
l came here because l want to
live like a human being...

219
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:43,080
...and not keep losing my sons.

220
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,800
You see, my youngest son...
...stepped on a mine.

221
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:51,400
Show them your leg, Azat.

222
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,360
Put this down for the record.

223
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,760
The court rules as follows.

224
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,320
One: that Haydar Altun
and Ramazan Altun be acquitted...

225
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:15,120
...given insu_icient grounds
for sentencing...

226
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:18,920
...under article 2216
of the Turkish Penal Code.

227
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,440
Two: that the five children
in their charge be put in the care...

228
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,480
...of the Social Senrices
and Child Protection Agency.

229
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:28,800
l don't understand.

230
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:33,280
We're taking your children away
so the state can look after them.

231
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,920
The state?

232
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,920
So yes, the state is paying you
10,600 Kroner every month.

233
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:46,920
ln Turkish money that works out
at something like 2000-2500 Lira.

234
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:50,200
Paying us?

235
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,040
Why are they paying us
when we're not even working?

236
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:55,600
Only God gives without taking.

237
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,680
Are you sure
there's no catch involved?

238
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:01,840
We're talking about
a welfare state here, Davut.

239
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:02,640
l've spoken to the asylum o_icer.

240
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,800
As far as Azat's concerned
they've promised to help.

241
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:07,839
So yes, once we're out of here
all that's left to do is...

242
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:14,160
...find a house first, then some work.

243
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:19,840
Tell me, Gülistan,
what sort of house shall we look at?

244
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:26,360
Gülistan, what's happened to you?

245
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:29,560
Why won't you speak?

246
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,920
None of your sister's wounds
have ever healed.

247
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,920
She's been like this for seven years,
ever since the mine exploded.

248
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:43,560
All she thinks about is Azat.
About the children.

249
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,080
l didn't see. l didn't see
what the children were doing.

250
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,080
What a wave of disasters
we've been hit by!

251
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:05,960
May God keep you
from anything worse.

252
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:07,799
lt's best to leave
everything to time.

253
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,360
How many times did l tell you

254
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,760
not to take me away!

255
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:15,799
Patience, Haydar. Patience!

256
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,240
He's right.
There's surely a solution to everything.

257
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:32,040
lt's God that gave you the boy,
and God that took him away.

258
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:13,400
lt wasn't your fault, my love.
It was the machine's fault.

259
00:27:15,319 --> 00:27:16,720
Now my little doves...

260
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:18,720
...you're starting school tomorrow.

261
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:18,759
From now on
you'll all be sleeping there.

262
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:21,079
l've spoken to the headmistress.
They'll be coming to fetch you.

263
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,120
All of us, dad?

264
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,200
Yes, all of you.

265
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,920
l'm not going!

266
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:36,280
l'm not going either, dad.
l'm staying with you.

267
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:41,320
But my love, it was so hard
to get you in there.

268
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:43,560
There's lots of kids at the school.

269
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:44,480
Don't be like this.

270
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:45,800
There are toys.
They play games...

271
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:48,000
...they go on trips, they learn.

272
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:58,000
Now don't cry, my little doves.
No more tears. Don't make me sad.

273
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:19,520
Like l said stick together
once you're there.

274
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:24,040
Work hard at your studies. OK?

275
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:26,040
Now kiss your grandpa's hand.

276
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,680
My little partridges...

277
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,120
My geraniums,
my hyacinths, my violets...

278
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:38,040
Work hard at your studies.
All right?

279
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,280
Let me take the baby.
Let me have him.

280
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,240
Dad, come with us.

281
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:52,519
Don't be like this, my doves.

282
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:56,120
You're going to school and
crying at the same time.

283
00:28:57,079 --> 00:28:58,040
O_ you go now. Go on.

284
00:28:58,759 --> 00:29:00,640
Come on, kids.
Let's get in the van.

285
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,480
The boy's making progress every day.
So is his sister.

286
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,360
Welcome, children.

287
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:32,280
Well, l was expecting you.

288
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:34,080
l'm your head-mother here.

289
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,360
Girls...
Shall we have a wander round?

290
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,840
And you know what?
We have a playroom too.

291
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,400
OK. Let's all go together.

292
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,680
All right?
Come on then.

293
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,680
Thank heavens for that!
She's opened her eyes.

294
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:07,280
isa, you go.
You've got things to do.

295
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:12,240
Ramo, she'll soon get better.

296
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:13,240
lf she doesn't get better,
we'll move to Istanbul too.

297
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:21,600
Zehra and mum will look after Havar.
They'll look after the kids too.

298
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,280
How will we get the kids back?

299
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:25,400
We should think about that.

300
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,520
lf they don't let us have them,
we'll steal them away.

301
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:42,280
Come on.

302
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,320
Go my beautifuls.

303
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:01,840
Ramo.

304
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,440
Are you allright my sun shine?

305
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:13,480
Everywhere aches. Ramo.

306
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:14,800
What?

307
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,160
How are my children?

308
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:18,200
Very good.
May God presenre from evil.

309
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,840
- Really?
- Yes.

310
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:28,360
Bring my children to me.

311
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,600
Children, your head-mother's here!

312
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,720
How are you, children?

313
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:51,759
We're fine, head-mother.

314
00:33:54,279 --> 00:33:57,600
Children, aren't you going to welcome
your new friends?

315
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:00,000
Welcome!

316
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:02,200
Now has everyone brushed
their teeth?

317
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,960
Yes!

318
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Well done!

319
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,560
Hayriye, take the girls o_
so they can get settled.

320
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,720
These are your beds, girls.

321
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,760
Everything happens to the poor.

322
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:30,800
Foist them on the rich again.

323
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:32,679
Take from us.

324
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,160
Embellishment is an excuse.
You know this stu_ right?

325
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,400
Fairy tale!

326
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,440
- Hello.
- Hello, Cuma.

327
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:40,480
There was a lad living round here.
A bit e_eminate.

328
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:43,760
Do you know where he's moved?

329
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:46,840
No idea.

330
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,560
Where can we find him then?

331
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:52,520
Those losers generally hang out
at transvestite bars in Beyoglu.

332
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:54,600
And sometimes they go out to work
in Harbiye.

333
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,640
What work is that?

334
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:58,920
Prostitution. You know?

335
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,440
- OK. Good night then.
- Good night.

336
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,680
Come on. Let's go, Mamo.

337
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:07,680
There's something dodgy there.

338
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:09,040
Hey, come on! Come on!

339
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,120
Run, run.

340
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:25,960
Good evening.

341
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,280
Good evening, hubby.

342
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,640
We're looking for someone called
Can who lives in TarlabaqI.

343
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:32,200
- Can?
- Can.

344
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:32,239
What's this Can like, hubby?
A butterFly or a bug?

345
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,520
He's just plain Can.

346
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:39,239
Are you up for it, hubby?

347
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,680
Buy one, get one free!

348
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:43,440
Fuck o_!
Just fuck o_!

349
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,760
Mamo..!
Mamo!

350
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:58,120
Life brings su_ering
as well as happiness, Davut.

351
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,720
Don't let it get you down.
Haydar will get over this too.

352
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:06,360
How's work?
Do you have an easy time there?

353
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,400
lt's great, thanks, uncle.

354
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:14,080
Uncle, there's something
l can't figure out, you know.

355
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:14,960
Why haven't you been able to
adjust to life here?

356
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:15,880
Well, nephew. Wherever it is,
no place far from home is bearable.

357
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,880
Not even if it were paradise.

358
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,440
Do you know what Cahit SItkI said?

359
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:30,960
''l long for a homeland''

360
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,800
''With skies of blue,
branches of green, fields of gold''

361
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:40,000
''A land of birds and flowers''

362
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:42,560
''l long for a homeland''

363
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:46,640
''Where life, like love,
comes from the heart''

364
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:50,880
''Where if there is cause to complain,
it is because of death''

365
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,800
''l long for a homeland''

366
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:57,960
''Where there is no grief,
nor cause to yearn''

367
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,640
''Where there is an end
to brothers fighting''

368
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:19,480
Here, love. The king's for you.
The queen goes to the king.

369
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:24,080
And here's the jack.
He's for all of us!

370
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:26,680
Newbie!

371
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:30,480
lt's time you went to work!

372
00:37:30,519 --> 00:37:33,400
There's no eating for free
without going out on the game!

373
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,720
Tansu! Don't be a bitch.
Don't make me lose it either!

374
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,080
What's going on, Cansu?
Life is hard for all of us.

375
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:40,360
She has to work
just like all the girls.

376
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:43,440
Just ignore her, love.

377
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,480
Goodbye, head-mother!

378
00:37:55,519 --> 00:37:57,800
Goodbye! Bye!

379
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,560
Do l look nice, head-mother?

380
00:38:02,599 --> 00:38:04,800
Beautiful. Goodbye!

381
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:08,240
The girls haven't recovered
psychologically yet.

382
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,560
They'll be seeing their mother
very soon, doctor.

383
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:18,160
ln all the years l've been here
l've never seen such a devoted father.

384
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,320
Poor thing...
He's been here every night.

385
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,600
Do you know the person in the photo?

386
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,200
Thanks.

387
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:21,080
Sorry sister, do you know
the person in the photo?

388
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:36,600
Don't look at me like that, Tansu!
l haven't done anything wrong!

389
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:36,639
Oh no?! Don't steal my fucks again
or you'll be sorry!

390
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:44,520
Tansu!

391
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,200
Cansu, keep out of this!

392
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:56,320
Excuse me...
Excuse me!

393
00:39:58,159 --> 00:39:59,720
Do you have any 'brunost'?

394
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,840
The kind you put on bread.
l guess not.

395
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:09,280
Berat!
Come and see what the man wants.

396
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,040
l'll be right there, dad.

397
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,520
Hello. Can l help?

398
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:17,040
l want some 'brunost'.

399
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:18,000
Brun..?

400
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:20,400
'Brunost'.
The kind you put on bread.

401
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:26,880
'Brunost'...
Ha! Brown goat's cheese.

402
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:31,200
Over there.

403
00:40:31,239 --> 00:40:32,840
Thanks.

404
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,520
Well done, son.

405
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:37,120
No, dad.
It's a tricky language.

406
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,840
Sorry, sister.

407
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:00,800
Do you know this person?

408
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,600
There, over there!

409
00:42:35,159 --> 00:42:36,120
This way! Come on!

410
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,600
So was that Kadri we were chasing?

411
00:42:58,239 --> 00:43:00,600
Let's ask that camp fellow in the bar.
He'll know.

412
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:04,920
Think carefully. Don't do anything
you regret when you find the boy.

413
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:09,920
ln fact, just forget the whole thing.

414
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:12,800
We'll take care of it now, Cuma.

415
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,720
Ramo and l will figure
something out.

416
00:43:15,719 --> 00:43:18,040
Remember.
l'm always here for you.

417
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:20,240
Thanks, Cuma.
Thanks.

418
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:27,000
Let me talk to him first if that's OK.
And you can examine him aftemards.

419
00:43:27,039 --> 00:43:28,160
Sure.

420
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:34,320
Nephew...
The doctor will measure you first...

421
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,840
...then they'll operate if necessary.

422
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:37,600
OK, uncle.

423
00:43:37,719 --> 00:43:38,560
That's my boy!

424
00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:38,599
Now put your leg up here, nephew.

425
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,080
Now lie down nephew.

426
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:44,200
Well done.

427
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,840
We need to find you
a new place to live.

428
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:53,360
But l don't have anywhere
to go in Istanbul.

429
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,120
ls this some kind of custom or what?

430
00:43:56,679 --> 00:43:58,600
lt's customary to migrate
but this isn't about customs.

431
00:43:59,559 --> 00:44:01,320
My situation's more serious than that.

432
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:04,480
My brothers can't bear me
being like this.

433
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:07,320
They won't rest easy
until they've killed me.

434
00:44:10,199 --> 00:44:13,520
Who gave you that?
Your boyfriend?

435
00:44:16,639 --> 00:44:18,640
No. l brought it from the village.

436
00:44:19,519 --> 00:44:23,400
We call it 'berFin'.
Its Turkish name is 'snowdrop'.

437
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:26,640
The flower has a story behind it.

438
00:44:29,239 --> 00:44:32,880
Only one living thing on earth
is in love with the sun.

439
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,600
And that's the 'berFin'.

440
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,080
The flower is in love with the sun,
but has never seen it.

441
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:44,200
You see, it knows that it'll die
the moment it sees the sun.

442
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,240
All 'berFins' look at the sun
knowing that they're going to die...

443
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,640
...and wilt away that very minute.

444
00:44:55,199 --> 00:44:57,160
Nothing can match the bravery
of a 'berFin'.

445
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,200
Ayyy!

446
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,200
Havar!

447
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:28,880
Are they here, doctor?

448
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:29,800
Yes.

449
00:45:30,559 --> 00:45:32,200
Come on, dear.
Let's go.

450
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:35,440
Careful now.
Don't hurry.

451
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,600
Run, girls.
Run!

452
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,880
Look how pretty you are!

453
00:46:27,559 --> 00:46:30,200
l am giong to stay with you Mum.

454
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,600
Mum, don't leave us!

455
00:46:33,639 --> 00:46:36,560
Don't cry now.
Do you think l'd leave you?

456
00:46:40,159 --> 00:46:46,760
Mum...
Mum... Mum...

457
00:47:00,519 --> 00:47:04,240
Darling, my precious!

458
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,600
Where's Serhat?

459
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:22,600
Dad? Mamo?
Where's Serhat?

460
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,640
Why won't any of you
say anything?

461
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:33,880
Where is he?

462
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,600
Serhat!

463
00:47:49,239 --> 00:47:49,239
How's that, Azat?
All right, son?

464
00:47:51,679 --> 00:47:52,840
Great, dad.

465
00:47:56,199 --> 00:47:58,400
l'm glad we're here, Nedim.

466
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:02,200
We're here, but my mind
is always on the family.

467
00:48:03,199 --> 00:48:03,199
On the wretched people
back home.

468
00:48:05,639 --> 00:48:08,960
l can't stop thinking of our
snowy mountains.

469
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:10,679
Davut, there are contradictions
in those mountains you miss.

470
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:18,240
Terrible contradictions, too.

471
00:48:19,079 --> 00:48:24,600
You have the guerrillas singing,
''Come up to the mountains!''

472
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:28,800
Then there's the army song that goes,
''l'll blow you to pieces, mountains.''

473
00:48:29,719 --> 00:48:29,719
But if only the mountains
could be left to themselves...

474
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:36,800
...left to the birds, to the flowers,
to the bugs and the butterFlies.

475
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,600
lf only they could rest!

476
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:43,200
How wonderFul that would be, Nedim.
How wonderFul!

477
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:49,440
We've seen what a nice life
people have here all together.

478
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:56,000
People are human beings above all,
whatever their language or religion.

479
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,120
Come on now! Tea time!

480
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:03,720
- Here you are, sweetie.
- Thanks.

481
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:31,640
Hey, it's your guys.
Come on! Move!

482
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:37,920
What is this maniac doing?

483
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:40,480
Sorry, sister.

484
00:49:41,239 --> 00:49:42,240
Do you know this person?

485
00:49:43,639 --> 00:49:44,360
What's his name?

486
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,480
lt's Kadri...
Kadri.

487
00:49:50,119 --> 00:49:53,160
l think l know him.
Why are you looking for him?

488
00:49:56,599 --> 00:49:58,680
Find him for us, sister.
We want to talk to him.

489
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:04,280
ln that case, come to
the old Galata Bridge at sunrise.

490
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:06,160
l'll find Kadri and bring him along.

491
00:50:06,639 --> 00:50:07,480
OK then.
Bye.

492
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,320
What happened, sister?
Couldn't you find him?

493
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:37,200
No. l looked everywhere.

494
00:50:37,239 --> 00:50:39,840
Doesn't he have
an address or anything?

495
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,600
Why are you looking for him?

496
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:45,680
He's gone his own way,
made his choice.

497
00:50:45,719 --> 00:50:48,000
lt's his life.
What harm is he to you?

498
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,280
His world is one thing,
yours is another.

499
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:52,800
Don't stay here.

500
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,280
Take your kids
and go back to your village.

501
00:50:56,599 --> 00:50:58,000
Give up looking for Kadri.
Bye-bye!

502
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:04,440
Kado!

503
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:13,320
Turn round to face me, Kado!

504
00:51:58,679 --> 00:52:04,400
Ramo, Mamo,
God made me like this.

505
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:06,400
l know you're going to kill me.

506
00:52:08,039 --> 00:52:11,520
When l die, l'll stand before God
and ask him just one thing.

507
00:52:11,559 --> 00:52:13,400
l'll say,
''Why didn't you make me a woman?''

508
00:52:17,719 --> 00:52:21,680
Go on Mamo...
Shoot me. l'm ready.

509
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:26,920
Mamo...
Just let him go.

510
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:43,600
Come on, Mamo.
Mamo, you know l'm a woman.

511
00:52:43,639 --> 00:52:44,720
Mamo, let him go!

512
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:47,120
l've done everything you can imagine.

513
00:52:47,159 --> 00:52:48,880
On the floor, standing up, in bed.

514
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:50,960
l've had all kinds of sex.

515
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,040
Your brother's a woman!
Accept it!

516
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:55,360
Your brother's a woman!

517
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:56,240
Shut up!

518
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,440
l told you.

519
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:33,680
You didn't listen.

520
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:40,600
lt's beneath us, Kado.

521
00:53:49,679 --> 00:53:50,600
Mamo.

522
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:30,680
Kado...

523
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:34,960
Brother!

524
00:54:58,639 --> 00:54:58,639
Come on, nephew.
Walk for your mother.

525
00:55:00,639 --> 00:55:02,200
But with your head held high.

526
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:19,040
Mum!
Mum!

527
00:55:25,039 --> 00:55:25,760
Mum!

528
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,560
Azat!

529
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:29,720
Dear head-mother
This is Ramazan Alt_n.

530
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:34,040
l'm very grateful to you
for looking after my children.

531
00:56:35,239 --> 00:56:39,440
My wife, the sunshine of my life,
got better in the state hospital.

532
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:41,480
Thanks to the mother state.

533
00:56:43,159 --> 00:56:48,200
But then there's also a father state
that made a big mistake with us.

534
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:52,200
We were pitched into a foreign land
where we couldn't adjust.

535
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,360
We decided to come back.

536
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:59,680
l'm going to carry on raising
my kids in the midst of the fighting.

537
00:57:00,639 --> 00:57:01,440
But how wonderFul it would be...

538
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:04,640
...if people who sing the same songs
people who support the same teams...

539
00:57:04,679 --> 00:57:09,840
...and are brothers in the same land
could embrace one another for once.

540
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:15,840
lt's us men who want war
and the mothers who weep.

541
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:20,560
lt's my belief that only mothers
can put an end to this business.

542
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:24,640
We look fomard to seeing you
if you're ever this way, head-mother.

543
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:27,920
With my greetings and regards...

544
00:57:29,039 --> 00:57:31,360
lN 25 YEARS OF CIVIL WAR IN TURKEY...

545
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:34,680
US_ 350 billion have been spent...
32,OOO guerrillas have been killed...

546
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:39,360
6,OOO members of the security forces
have been killed...

547
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:45,960
5600 people have gone missing...
3200 villages have been evacuated...

548
00:57:46,599 --> 00:57:49,800
2 million people have been
forced to migrate.
