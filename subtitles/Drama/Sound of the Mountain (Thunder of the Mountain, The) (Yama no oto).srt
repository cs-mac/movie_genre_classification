changed us both beyond all reckoning."</i>

7
00:01:49,622 --> 00:01:52,084
This poor boy's from Alabama.

8
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:55,881
- He's a long way from home.
- Thank you.

9
00:01:59,636 --> 00:02:02,599
Why don't them Yanks just attack?

10
00:02:12,657 --> 00:02:14,494
Got any shirts, son?

11
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:20,794
<i>Mm-hm-hm-hm</i>

12
00:02:21,169 --> 00:02:23,424
It's Mo Oakley's boy.

13
00:02:24,173 --> 00:02:27,096
Can't be old enough to fight, can he?

14
00:02:33,187 --> 00:02:35,692
- Good morning.
- Morning, son.

15
00:02:36,693 --> 00:02:39,196
Got some boots and jackets.
You want one?

16
00:02:39,197 --> 00:02:41,826
- Here. You want that?
- Thanks.

17
00:02:43,203 --> 00:02:45,666
I hope these boots can hold up
for 400 miles,

18

Same as us. Seen too much war.

28
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:51,726
Hey, Oakley. Don't worry, son.
Them Yankee boys keep store hours.

They ain't open yet.

30
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:06,623
Close it up.

- Hey, that's fresh breakfast.

- He's mine, Butcher.
- Hey! Hey! Get away!

- Hey, I saw him first.
- Come on!

- I saw it first!
- That's my rabbit! That's my rabbit!

- I call this nail Northern Aggression.

- Damn right.
- I call this nail the Yankee Skulls.

Last time I checked,
the South was a direction.

45

Never figured you
for a Lincoln lover, JT.

46

I tell you,
as soon as I finish this chapel,

47

Whoa, here comes the minister.

Ben, thank you.
Will you assist my daughter?

- Mr. Swanger! Good morning to you.
- Morning, Reverend.

- Miss Monroe.
- Good morning.

- Morning.
- Morning.

60

- Excellent progress.
- Morning.

- Mrs. Swanger, Mrs. Castlereagh.
- Morning, Reverend.

Now, if y'all will excuse me.

63
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:36,354
In Charleston, my congregation would still
be disputing the size of the windows.

64
00:06:36,397 --> 00:06:37,189
It's a chapel.

65
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:40,444
Miss Monroe,
I was just thinkin' about you.

66
00:06:40,485 --> 00:06:44,325
Cold Mountain must feel
like the end of the world.

67
00:06:44,492 --> 00:06:46,996
Not at all.

68
00:06:46,997 --> 00:06:51,462
- It's very beautiful.
- Well, you put us all to shame.

69
00:06:51,503 --> 00:06:54,674
Men up here had a bearing on
what they thought a woman was,

70
00:06:55,009 --> 00:06:58,346
- and then you showed up.
- Oh..

71
00:06:58,514 --> 00:07:00,432
- No, I doubt that.
- Oh, believe me.

72
00:07:00,433 --> 00:07:05,567
If you was to say a word to one of these
fools, I could get my top field cleared.

73
00:07:07,445 --> 00:07:09,781
- Any one?
- No, um..

74
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:12,744
Him in particular.

75
00:07:12,954 --> 00:07:14,705
Up in the rafters.

76
00:07:14,706 --> 00:07:17,503
Won't normally say boo to a goose.

77
00:07:20,715 --> 00:07:24,553
He's been pressin' me
since the day you arrived here.

78
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,774
- Your top field cleared?
- That's right.

79
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:40,162
Good morning, I'm Ada Monroe.

80
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,623
Inman.

81
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:44,001
Inman.

82
00:07:44,002 --> 00:07:45,837
WP Inman.

83
00:07:47,424 --> 00:07:48,925
WP Inman.

84
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:51,722
Repeatin' a thing doesn't improve it.

85
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:56,145
People call me Inman.

86
00:07:58,524 --> 00:08:00,402
How 'bout that? Inman speaks.

87
00:08:00,527 --> 00:08:04,574
If you were to take a glass of cider,
your friends might stop staring.

88
00:08:07,121 --> 00:08:09,123
Inman.

89
00:08:10,626 --> 00:08:15,675
You're just jealous. I'm gonna
take her for a walk at Bishop's Creek.

90
00:08:15,884 --> 00:08:18,554
- Billy, is this frame flush?
- Thank you.

91
00:08:18,555 --> 00:08:22,350
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Thank you, yeah, right.

92
00:08:23,144 --> 00:08:26,274
Richie, I seen your house. There
ain't a square angle anywhere near it.

93
00:08:26,733 --> 00:08:28,568
And what do you do?

94
00:08:28,569 --> 00:08:30,864
I workwood.

95
00:08:31,072 --> 00:08:32,910
Hunt.

96
00:08:34,078 --> 00:08:36,666
Mostly work wood.

97
00:08:39,002 --> 00:08:41,089
Clear fields?

98
00:08:45,012 --> 00:08:47,474
I can clear a field.

99
00:08:48,517 --> 00:08:52,315
Was there something in particular
you wished to say to me?

100
00:08:56,863 --> 00:08:59,493
Not that comes to me.

101
00:09:06,043 --> 00:09:08,797
I'll say thank you.. for the cider.

102
00:10:58,717 --> 00:11:01,513
Move back! Go back! Move back!

103
00:11:01,723 --> 00:11:04,436
Go back! Go back!

104
00:11:04,728 --> 00:11:09,232
They're trapped in the wrong
damn crater. Whole plan backfired on 'em.

105
00:11:09,233 --> 00:11:11,572
Send them Yanks straight to hell.

106
00:11:11,739 --> 00:11:14,743
- Hold it, hold it.
- Let's go. Turn it around.

107
00:11:17,496 --> 00:11:19,999
Damn fools
dug their own grave.

108
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,631
We've got 'em now, boys.

109
00:11:24,508 --> 00:11:28,137
- It's a turkey shoot.
- What?

110
00:11:28,514 --> 00:11:31,852
It's a turkey shoot.
They've run themselves into a hole.

111
00:11:32,019 --> 00:11:34,147
Hell's busted.

112
00:12:35,534 --> 00:12:37,579
Oakley!

113
00:12:49,555 --> 00:12:51,892
Oakley!

114
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,364
Oakley!

115
00:13:27,114 --> 00:13:30,326
- Inman! Inman!
- Oakley!

116
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:35,377

117

- Come on.

118
00:14:06,758 --> 00:14:08,595
Inman.

119
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:13,185
- I've got you.

120
00:14:40,811 --> 00:14:43,438
I got a few.

121
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:46,361
- You saw?
- I saw.

122
00:14:50,158 --> 00:14:52,787
Am I gonna die?

123
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,379
Your folks can be real proud of you.

124
00:15:12,109 --> 00:15:16,951
Son, this fellow says
he'll play whatever you want.

125
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:22,625
What about "Bonaparte's Retreat"?
That's one I play.

126
00:15:28,134 --> 00:15:31,599
No. Play me somethin' sweet.

127
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:34,518
Like a girl's waiting for me.

128
00:15:35,144 --> 00:15:39,151
- You heard him.
- I only know a couple of tunes.

129
00:15:39,152 --> 00:15:41,654
Like when you're at Bishop's Creek..

130
00:15:42,656 --> 00:15:45,618
and you're thirsty..

131
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,582
and the water's so cool.

132
00:15:50,168 --> 00:15:52,380
I don't know what music that is.

133
00:16:17,711 --> 00:16:20,840
I'm reachin' Cold Mountain before you.

134
00:16:58,106 --> 00:16:59,983
Good morning, Sally.

135
00:17:04,698 --> 00:17:08,163
- Well, that's a fine-sounding thing.
- Oh..

136
00:17:09,207 --> 00:17:11,168
My piano.

137
00:17:12,544 --> 00:17:14,630
Oh, I've been missing it.

138
00:17:14,631 --> 00:17:19,346
Thank you, by the way,
Inman's in my top field clearing his debt.

139
00:17:19,555 --> 00:17:21,517
Oh, dear.

140
00:17:25,732 --> 00:17:27,817
And then he had nothing to say.

141
00:17:27,818 --> 00:17:30,322
He was happy.

142
00:17:31,908 --> 00:17:34,079
Really?

143
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,957
Are men so different in Charleston?

144
00:17:39,086 --> 00:17:40,713
Men?

145
00:17:42,092 --> 00:17:44,051
I don't know.

146
00:17:44,343 --> 00:17:50,102
If you're sayin' you might like him,
why not go over and say good mornin'?

147
00:17:50,186 --> 00:17:52,105
I should be gettin' along.

148
00:17:52,106 --> 00:17:54,943
Walk on, quickly.

149
00:17:55,194 --> 00:17:58,197
Come on, Walk on. Slowly.

150
00:17:58,198 --> 00:18:00,077
Walk on.

151
00:18:10,383 --> 00:18:12,847
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

152
00:18:44,687 --> 00:18:47,398
My dear daughter, Ada,

153
00:18:47,691 --> 00:18:54,284
who's given up so much for so long to help
me in my ministry, and upon whom I rely.

154
00:18:56,704 --> 00:19:02,966
Friends, we are both very happy
to have this opportunity tonight..

155
00:19:04,217 --> 00:19:07,013
to thank you from our hearts..

156
00:19:07,721 --> 00:19:12,938
for your kind welcome
and, most of all, such a fine chapel.

157
00:19:14,733 --> 00:19:17,069
So..

158
00:19:17,236 --> 00:19:20,243
thank you, and God bless you.

159
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:29,255
Our house is always open
to any of you at any time.

160
00:19:29,256 --> 00:19:31,757
Welcome.

161
00:19:31,758 --> 00:19:32,803
Esco?

162
00:19:37,269 --> 00:19:39,270
That gentleman - he help build the chapel?

163
00:19:39,271 --> 00:19:42,276
Him? No, that's Teague.

164
00:19:42,277 --> 00:19:46,200
At one time the Teague family
owned the whole of Cold Mountain.

165
00:19:46,283 --> 00:19:50,830
My farm, your farm,
it all belonged to his grandpappy.

166
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,792
Teague wanted this place bad,
and you got it.

167
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:56,589
And he's here sniff in' out an advantage.

168
00:19:58,801 --> 00:20:04,310
There's no advantage here,
except to celebrate a job well done.

169
00:20:04,311 --> 00:20:06,311
And that is a good thing
in these troubled times.

170
00:20:06,312 --> 00:20:09,441
- Miss Monroe.
- Thank you.

171
00:20:14,325 --> 00:20:19,541
- Were you never planning to come inside?
- I'm wetter than a fish.

172
00:20:20,835 --> 00:20:24,131
- There's a good fire going.
- I'm all right.

173
00:20:26,845 --> 00:20:29,766
You're always carrying a tray.

174
00:20:31,852 --> 00:20:35,442
I was going to take some root beer
over to the Negroes.

175
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:46,333
Somebody said you were enlisting.

176
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:50,173
- Are you?
- If there is a war, we'll all fight.

177
00:21:03,901 --> 00:21:07,282
- Did you get a picture made?
- Say again?

178
00:21:07,408 --> 00:21:11,914
A tintype, with your musket
and your courage on display.

179
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:15,920
You're laughin' at me.

180
00:21:17,423 --> 00:21:19,841
I don't know you.

181
00:21:23,432 --> 00:21:26,770
This doesn't come out right.

182
00:21:26,937 --> 00:21:32,488
If it were enough just to stand,
without the words..

183
00:21:34,449 --> 00:21:36,452
It is.

184
00:21:39,457 --> 00:21:41,377
It is.

185
00:21:44,966 --> 00:21:47,260
You.. Look.

186
00:21:47,469 --> 00:21:50,848
Look. Look at the sky now.
What color is it?

187
00:21:52,977 --> 00:21:55,855
Or the way.. a hawk flies?

188
00:21:58,486 --> 00:22:00,989
Or you wake up..

189
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:05,454
and your ribs are bruised
thinking so hard on somebody.

190
00:22:07,001 --> 00:22:09,503
What do you call that?

191
00:22:18,016 --> 00:22:20,019
I'll do that.

192
00:22:21,021 --> 00:22:23,775
I can't get much wetter.

193
00:22:26,529 --> 00:22:30,910
<i>"What if you are killed,
and I'll never see you again?</i>

194
00:22:31,035 --> 00:22:35,877
<i>"You said after a few years
I would barely remember your name.</i>

195
00:22:36,044 --> 00:22:38,546
<i>"Oh, Inman.</i>

196
00:22:38,547 --> 00:22:43,348
<i>It is more than three years,
and I remember your name."</i>

197
00:22:44,056 --> 00:22:46,852
Soldiers. Don't get up.

198
00:22:49,064 --> 00:22:51,193
You are mentioned tonight in my report.

199
00:22:51,568 --> 00:22:56,534
You men from Cold Mountain have
once again been heroes for the cause.

200
00:22:56,575 --> 00:23:00,081
There are Yankees in that stand of trees
between us, stuck there from the retreat.

201
00:23:00,082 --> 00:23:05,922
<i>If they stay there, tomorrow mornin'
they can shoot us down for sport.</i>

202
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,098
Go around.

203
00:23:13,602 --> 00:23:15,395
It's a Reb!

204
00:23:15,605 --> 00:23:16,941
How many of them are there?

205
00:23:17,108 --> 00:23:18,608
I think there's five.

206
00:23:18,609 --> 00:23:21,531
Under the trees.

207
00:23:23,616 --> 00:23:25,619
- We got 'em.
- Let's go, let's go.

208
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:28,207
Butcher's down.

209
00:23:29,126 --> 00:23:33,340
Leave him, leave him.
He's gone. Let's go.

210
00:23:34,634 --> 00:23:37,471
Go, go! Go! Run!

211
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,563
- Go! Go! Go!
- Hold your fire!

212
00:23:42,646 --> 00:23:44,776
What's over by them trees?

213
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,780
It's us! It's us!

214
00:23:50,491 --> 00:23:53,456
I said hold your fire! Hold your fire.

215
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:02,844
Leave him. Leave him.

216
00:24:03,012 --> 00:24:04,805
Agh!

217
00:24:32,056 --> 00:24:34,476
<i>Inman'll get it.</i>

218
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:39,400
Supposed to bring good luck,
a bird caught in a room.

219
00:24:39,567 --> 00:24:44,157
I'm so sorry to have kept you
waiting. She'll just be a few seconds.

220
00:25:49,259 --> 00:25:51,261
- Mr. Inman.
- Reverend.

221
00:25:51,262 --> 00:25:54,098
- What can I do for you?
- I have some sheet music.

222
00:25:54,265 --> 00:25:57,437
It belonged to my father.
No use to me.

223
00:25:57,438 --> 00:25:59,108
Thank you.

224
00:25:59,525 --> 00:26:01,527
- You must come in.
- I should probably get along.

225
00:26:01,528 --> 00:26:04,783
Mr. Inman is more comfortable outdoors.

226
00:26:05,117 --> 00:26:08,705
Perhaps we might..
perhaps we might take a walk.

227
00:26:08,706 --> 00:26:10,666
A splendid idea.

228
00:26:13,629 --> 00:26:16,133
Let me just get your hat.

229
00:26:20,056 --> 00:26:24,730
I dragged my poor daughter 400 miles
from Charleston to Cold Mountain

230
00:26:24,813 --> 00:26:28,818
because my doctors,
they've been sayin' my chest is weak.

231
00:26:28,819 --> 00:26:31,616
So the air's supposed to do me good.

232
00:26:32,826 --> 00:26:35,204
But it's the view I think heals.

233
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:39,835
It's what people say
we're fightin' for. To keep it that way.

234
00:26:39,836 --> 00:26:43,843
I have no plans to preach war
in my church, Mr. Inman.

235
00:26:45,428 --> 00:26:51,147
I imagine God is weary of being called
down on both sides of an argument.

236
00:26:53,192 --> 00:26:55,651
I imagine God is.

237
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,664
Thank you.

238
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:08,255
Now, your father played the piano, did he?

239
00:27:08,297 --> 00:27:10,510
That's right. He was a teacher.

240
00:27:10,802 --> 00:27:13,263
And is your father living, Mr. Inman?

241
00:27:13,305 --> 00:27:15,307
- He is not.
- And your mother?

242
00:27:15,308 --> 00:27:18,605
No, sir. She died when I was born.

243
00:28:15,567 --> 00:28:19,198
- Secession.
- North Carolina left the Union.

244
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:26,376
Whoo!

245
00:28:26,418 --> 00:28:28,922
- We got our war!
- Whoo-hoo!

246
00:28:56,131 --> 00:29:00,720
We got our war! We got it!
We got it! It's about time.

247
00:29:01,138 --> 00:29:03,100
Whoo!

248
00:29:05,228 --> 00:29:07,690
- All right!
- Inman! Inman!

249
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:10,235
Ready to fight, son, ready to fight.

250
00:29:10,236 --> 00:29:11,236
Whoo!

251
00:29:11,237 --> 00:29:13,616
We got our war, man.

252
00:29:13,741 --> 00:29:16,202
Well, you have your war.

253
00:29:17,245 --> 00:29:18,414
Ada.

254
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,544
Ada.

255
00:29:22,755 --> 00:29:25,718
It's a great day for North Carolina.

256
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:29,765
Those who follow Lincoln
or preach abolition..

257
00:29:30,767 --> 00:29:32,769
you best keep one eye open
when you're sleepin'.

258
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:35,900
Ol' boogeyman might get you.

259
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:39,572
Are you the law all of a sudden,
Mr. Teague?

260
00:29:39,781 --> 00:29:41,783
That's right, son.

261
00:29:41,784 --> 00:29:45,749
Home Guard for Haywood County.
And I'm the law from today.

262
00:29:45,791 --> 00:29:50,713
Y'all go fight now.
We'll watch over your sweethearts.

263
00:29:50,797 --> 00:29:53,051
Hey, Teague.
Why ain't you fightin'?

264
00:29:53,301 --> 00:29:55,805
'Cause he's too old.

265
00:29:55,806 --> 00:29:58,060
Yeah!

266
00:29:58,309 --> 00:30:00,063
Whoo!

267
00:30:00,313 --> 00:30:03,360
You might be safer back in Charleston.

268
00:30:07,072 --> 00:30:11,160
- But then who'll be waiting for you?
- Three cheers for North Carolina!

269
00:30:11,161 --> 00:30:13,287
- All right.
- Three cheers for the South!

270
00:30:13,663 --> 00:30:14,957
Hip hip hurrah!

271
00:30:14,999 --> 00:30:17,000
Hip hip hurrah!

272
00:30:17,584 --> 00:30:19,711
Hip hip hurrah!

273
00:30:31,351 --> 00:30:34,270
Inman. It belongs to Inman.

274
00:30:34,354 --> 00:30:36,691
I got it. He's here.

275
00:30:40,695 --> 00:30:45,909
They found that book
you been worryin' about, soldier.

276
00:31:25,749 --> 00:31:27,541
Wait.

277
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:41,266
I found you this book to take with you.

278
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:43,519
William Bartram.

279
00:31:44,853 --> 00:31:47,357
They tell me it's good.

280
00:31:48,358 --> 00:31:52,571
I think he writes about these parts,
the author, so..

281
00:31:53,364 --> 00:31:55,366
Thank you.

282
00:31:56,867 --> 00:31:58,830
And this.

283
00:32:06,879 --> 00:32:09,467
I'm not smiling in it.

284
00:32:12,387 --> 00:32:15,181
I don't know how to do that,

285
00:32:15,389 --> 00:32:17,143
hold a smile.

286
00:32:40,752 --> 00:32:42,755
- Ada.
- What?

287
00:33:05,783 --> 00:33:08,285
- Whoa!
- He'll be back in a month.

288
00:33:10,787 --> 00:33:13,123
Kiss her for me.

289
00:33:20,301 --> 00:33:22,385
Come on, let's go.

290
00:33:27,724 --> 00:33:30,603
I'll be waiting for you.

291
00:34:06,521 --> 00:34:07,980
Lookin' good, Butcher.

292
00:34:08,021 --> 00:34:10,357
Bring home
some Yankee scalps, Swimmer.

293
00:34:10,525 --> 00:34:12,319
Yee-haw!

294
00:34:16,532 --> 00:34:21,705
<i>Look out the window, ladies.
See what these poor fools are dyin' for.</i>

295
00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:26,209
<i>How many would still lose a leg
for the rich man's slave?</i>

296
00:34:27,044 --> 00:34:29,785
Most of these soldiers'll
be dead by morning,

297
00:34:29,798 --> 00:34:32,549
or if they're stubborn,
by nightfall.

298
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:37,055
I've other men outside
in the courtyard waitin' for beds,

299
00:34:37,056 --> 00:34:39,685
so any kind word will be a blessin'.

300
00:34:43,564 --> 00:34:46,065
It's the heat. I'm sorry. They rot.

301
00:34:46,066 --> 00:34:48,570
Pigeon River..

302
00:34:48,571 --> 00:34:51,281
How are you, son?

303
00:34:51,573 --> 00:34:54,577
Cold.. Mountain..

304
00:34:57,079 --> 00:34:59,080
I-I'm sorry.

305
00:34:59,081 --> 00:35:03,462
- You want water?
- Cold.. Mountain.

306
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:07,926
Cold Mountain?

307
00:35:08,593 --> 00:35:10,596
Cold Mountain.

308
00:35:13,683 --> 00:35:19,607
Do you worry when there's no word
from him? From Mr. Inman?

309
00:35:21,191 --> 00:35:23,028
Yes.

310
00:35:25,696 --> 00:35:28,200
But then I've tried countin'
the number of words

311
00:35:28,201 --> 00:35:33,163
which have passed between Mr. Inman
and me - not very many.

312
00:35:33,206 --> 00:35:37,418
But I think about him, Daddy, all the time.

313
00:35:37,794 --> 00:35:41,967
I lost your mother
after 22 months of marriage.

314
00:35:43,885 --> 00:35:46,345
It was enough to fill a life.

315
00:35:52,478 --> 00:35:54,479
That was the last of the ham.

316
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,902
- It was delicious.
- I have to learn how to cook.

317
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:00,446
I was thinking of saying
something in chapel.

318
00:36:00,571 --> 00:36:02,573
Perhaps some of the womenfolk
will volunteer.

319
00:36:02,574 --> 00:36:05,912
I can't have people coming here
and cooking for me.

320
00:36:08,081 --> 00:36:09,456
I so..

321
00:36:09,581 --> 00:36:11,083
I so regret..

322
00:36:11,084 --> 00:36:17,383
I should have raised you less like a
companion and more like a young woman.

323
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:21,595
I'm sorry, Ada.
And for dragging you here.

324
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,557
I'm not sorry.

325
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:29,897
I would have followed you anywhere.

326
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:34,737
- To Mongolia.
- Mongolia.

327
00:36:35,779 --> 00:36:38,416
But with no one left
to work this place,

328
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:41,077
nothing to buy, nothing
left to buy it with..

329
00:36:42,704 --> 00:36:46,668
I just don't know how we're gonna
get through another winter.

330
00:36:49,795 --> 00:36:55,596
Will you play me somethin'? Somethin'
peaceful while I look over my sermon.

331
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,470
It's too damp out here.
You should come inside.

332
00:36:57,471 --> 00:36:59,140
No.

333
00:36:59,557 --> 00:37:01,476
I like it.

334
00:37:16,076 --> 00:37:19,080
Daddy, bring the tablecloth in.

335
00:37:21,583 --> 00:37:24,085
Come inside before you drown.

336
00:38:11,976 --> 00:38:14,145
You have a letter.

337
00:38:14,478 --> 00:38:16,439
North Carolina.

338
00:38:17,982 --> 00:38:20,569
It's come a long way.

339
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:25,782
It's not too recent.

340
00:38:25,991 --> 00:38:28,455
It's written this past winter.

341
00:38:30,998 --> 00:38:33,417
I'm afraid I can't read who it's from.

342
00:38:38,006 --> 00:38:40,426
"Dear Mr. Inman.."

343
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:46,643
<i>"Since you've left, time has been
measured out in bitter chapters."</i>

344
00:38:46,849 --> 00:38:49,520
<i>"Last fall, my poor father died."</i>

345
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:54,151
<i>"Our farm at Black Cove is abandoned."</i>

346
00:38:57,279 --> 00:39:01,324
<i>"Every house in these mountains
touched by tragedy."</i>

347
00:39:03,871 --> 00:39:08,751
<i>"Each day the dread..
of learning who has fallen.."</i>

348
00:39:09,709 --> 00:39:12,713
<i>who will not return from this terrible war.</i>

349
00:39:15,048 --> 00:39:18,010
<i>"And no word from you.</i>

350
00:39:18,052 --> 00:39:20,182
<i>"Are you alive?</i>

351
00:39:20,306 --> 00:39:23,101
<i>"I pray to God you are.</i>

352
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:26,145
<i>"This war is lost on the battlefield</i>

353
00:39:26,229 --> 00:39:30,985
<i>and is being lost twice over
by those who stayed behind."</i>

354
00:39:31,235 --> 00:39:34,657
He ain't comin' back, you know that.

355
00:39:38,745 --> 00:39:41,332
You must know that in your heart.

356
00:39:44,333 --> 00:39:46,461
Look at me.

357
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,134
Look at me.

358
00:39:55,347 --> 00:39:57,976
I'm not nothin'.

359
00:40:00,186 --> 00:40:04,609
<i>"I'm still waiting,
as I promised I would."</i>

360
00:40:07,194 --> 00:40:11,157
<i>"But I find myself alone
and at the end of my wits..</i>

361
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:16,872
<i>too embarrassed to keep taking
from those who can least afford to give."</i>

362
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:21,209
Ada! It's Sally!

363
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,211
Ada!

364
00:40:22,212 --> 00:40:24,506
Look at the state of this place.

365
00:40:24,715 --> 00:40:28,302
Well, set it on the porch.

366
00:40:29,637 --> 00:40:33,184
She let them slaves go free,
and now..

367
00:40:33,643 --> 00:40:38,440
Poor soul, she's got nobody and nothin',
and waitin' on a ghost.

368
00:40:44,657 --> 00:40:46,615
Shoo!

369
00:40:49,161 --> 00:40:51,121
Go away.

370
00:40:56,252 --> 00:40:57,672
Devil!

371
00:41:00,759 --> 00:41:05,305
<i>"My last thread of courage now
is to put my faith in you.."</i>

372
00:41:08,016 --> 00:41:10,770
<i>"and to believe I will see you again."</i>

373
00:41:12,104 --> 00:41:16,527
<i>"So now I say to you, plain as I can.."</i>

374
00:41:18,111 --> 00:41:21,364
<i>"if you are fighting, stop fighting."</i>

375
00:41:22,616 --> 00:41:25,953
<i>"If you are marching, stop marching."</i>

376
00:41:27,622 --> 00:41:30,082
<i>"Come back to me."</i>

377
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:35,924
"Come back to me is my request."

378
00:41:44,142 --> 00:41:46,770
<i>"Come back to me."</i>

379
00:41:48,647 --> 00:41:52,068
<i>"Come back to me is my request."</i>

380
00:41:54,154 --> 00:41:58,074
Wounded men, don't stray
from the hospital grounds.

381
00:41:58,743 --> 00:42:00,703
Hey!

382
00:42:02,747 --> 00:42:04,207
If they send us back to fight..

383
00:42:04,248 --> 00:42:08,172
Hey, get your peanuts now,
from the blind man,

384
00:42:09,755 --> 00:42:13,177
- Hey, your hot goobers here.
- It's a sad day.

385
00:42:17,265 --> 00:42:20,060
Gettin' better, soldier?

386
00:42:20,268 --> 00:42:22,769
Seems that way.

387
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:24,732
I wouldn't hurry.

388
00:42:24,773 --> 00:42:28,777
The war's almost done.
Don't need your help to lose it.

389
00:42:29,945 --> 00:42:35,036
You got ten minutes now, boys. Ten
minutes to get your haircuts and shaves.

390
00:42:35,536 --> 00:42:38,205
I've been meanin' to ask you.
Where'd you take your wound?

391
00:42:38,206 --> 00:42:40,456
Oh, before I was born.

392
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:42,920
Never set eyes on a thing in this world.

393
00:42:42,961 --> 00:42:48,467
Not a tree, a gun or a woman.
Put my hand on all three, though.

394
00:42:50,302 --> 00:42:53,099
- What would you give for that?
- Hm?

395
00:42:53,556 --> 00:42:57,979
- To have your eyeballs for ten minutes.
- Ten minutes?

396
00:42:58,061 --> 00:43:00,314
I wouldn't give an lndian head cent.

397
00:43:00,315 --> 00:43:04,319
- Might turn me hateful.
- That's sure what seein's done to me.

398
00:43:04,736 --> 00:43:07,571
No, that's not the way I meant it.

399
00:43:07,572 --> 00:43:10,076
You said ten minutes.

400
00:43:10,077 --> 00:43:14,499
It's havin' a thing and then
the loss of it I'm talking about.

401
00:43:14,832 --> 00:43:20,462
Then we don't agree. There's not much I
wouldn't give for ten minutes of someplace.

402
00:43:20,587 --> 00:43:24,718
Yeah, someplace.. or someone.

403
00:43:27,431 --> 00:43:30,393
You watch yourself, now.

404
00:43:30,517 --> 00:43:33,478
They're shootin' men
who take themselves a walk.

405
00:44:12,651 --> 00:44:15,653
By order of Zebulon Vance,

406
00:44:15,654 --> 00:44:18,531
governor of this great state
of North Carolina,

407
00:44:19,325 --> 00:44:24,245
any soldier turned deserter
is guilty of treason,

408
00:44:24,246 --> 00:44:27,166
and should be hunted down like a dog.

409
00:44:28,835 --> 00:44:34,258
Any man who takes in a deserter
is likewise guilty of treason.

410
00:44:34,259 --> 00:44:37,396
The Home Guard is powered
to enter any place

411
00:44:37,409 --> 00:44:40,557
it sees fit without
notice or constraint.

412
00:44:41,768 --> 00:44:44,728
Captain Teague needs more volunteers.

413
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:48,775
Any man whose age or infirmity
prevents him from fightin' shall join us

414
00:44:48,776 --> 00:44:53,364
to protect this county from Yankee raiders
and traitors to the cause.

415
00:44:53,781 --> 00:44:55,284
- Is there a letter for me?
- Nothin'.

416
00:44:55,285 --> 00:45:00,123
We've been gettin' no post through at all.
The sooner we lose this war the better.

417
00:45:00,373 --> 00:45:03,458
They say not one boy in ten
is comin' home to these mountains.

418
00:45:03,459 --> 00:45:08,591
Teague and his rabble throwin' their weight
around. They're worse than the Yankees.

419
00:45:09,048 --> 00:45:11,678
Might I speak with you, please?

420
00:45:12,971 --> 00:45:15,515
This was the Reverend Monroe's.

421
00:45:18,645 --> 00:45:21,440
I don't know who would want a watch.

422
00:45:23,651 --> 00:45:25,777
Who can bear to look at the time?

423
00:45:29,157 --> 00:45:32,285
I've got a little salt pork you can have.

424
00:45:33,661 --> 00:45:36,041
Keep your daddy's watch.

425
00:45:37,665 --> 00:45:40,003
Thank you.

426
00:45:42,171 --> 00:45:43,965
I was talkin' to some
of the other womenfolk

427
00:45:44,175 --> 00:45:46,675
about maybe lookin' in on you
at Black Cove. It's hard right now, but..

428
00:45:46,676 --> 00:45:50,514
Oh, no, I manage very well.
Whatever the talk is.

429
00:45:53,185 --> 00:45:55,645
I'm very grateful for the pork.

430
00:45:58,191 --> 00:46:01,320
Which I intend to pay for, of course.

431
00:46:09,788 --> 00:46:12,290
Is everything all right?

432
00:46:12,291 --> 00:46:14,085
Mm-hmm.

433
00:46:28,978 --> 00:46:30,769
Ada.

434
00:46:30,978 --> 00:46:32,773
Ada.

435
00:46:34,483 --> 00:46:38,029
Why, Ada, you are skinny
as a whippet, girl.

436
00:46:38,488 --> 00:46:41,824
- You are comin' indoors with me.
- No, I can't.

437
00:46:41,825 --> 00:46:43,786
I don't..

438
00:46:45,329 --> 00:46:47,246
I can't keep countin' on your kindness.

439
00:46:47,247 --> 00:46:49,251
Now, come on. I'm makin' a stew.

440
00:46:49,585 --> 00:46:54,507
We'd be proud to have you.
Esco's gonna be wantin' his dinner.

441
00:46:55,758 --> 00:46:59,221
I just wanna stop, I tell you. Yeah.

442
00:46:59,263 --> 00:47:03,516
Sit on the porch with Sal,
watch my boys in the fields,

443
00:47:03,517 --> 00:47:07,481
holler "Good job" every hour or so.

444
00:47:07,522 --> 00:47:11,320
That'll be a good day,
when our boys get home.

445
00:47:11,611 --> 00:47:14,696
What about your people in Charleston?

446
00:47:17,617 --> 00:47:20,119
There are no people.

447
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:22,789
And there's no money.

448
00:47:23,123 --> 00:47:27,128
My father had some bonds
and investments.

449
00:47:27,129 --> 00:47:30,800
They're worthless now, of course.
The war..

450
00:47:32,633 --> 00:47:37,558
They're not worth anything.
I don't have anywhere else to go.

451
00:47:43,148 --> 00:47:45,442
I don't wanna go.

452
00:47:47,653 --> 00:47:50,740
- You're waiting on a feller.
- Oh!

453
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:55,662
- Look down our well..
- Esco..

454
00:47:55,663 --> 00:47:57,665
She should.

455
00:47:58,665 --> 00:48:03,964
If you look down our well with a mirror,
you'll see the future. It's what they say.

456
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:07,926
You do it.
She does it.

457
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:11,889
What kind of mirror?

458
00:48:13,183 --> 00:48:16,937
- We'll hold on to you, Esco, you hold on.
- I got her.

459
00:48:17,187 --> 00:48:19,691
- We got you.
- Mm.

460
00:48:21,192 --> 00:48:23,195
See anything?

461
00:48:25,697 --> 00:48:26,865
Uh..

462
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,785
Uh..

463
00:48:29,202 --> 00:48:31,954
- I don't know.
- I tried many a time.

464
00:48:31,955 --> 00:48:35,251
Lookin' for a sign
my boys were comin' home.

465
00:48:35,543 --> 00:48:37,963
I never saw a dickey bird.

466
00:48:52,979 --> 00:48:55,816
- Oh!
- Are you all right? Ada?

467
00:48:55,817 --> 00:48:58,736
What? What happened?

468
00:49:00,738 --> 00:49:03,408
What'd you see? What'd you see?

469
00:49:04,243 --> 00:49:07,580
<i>"Yesterday,
I saw you walkin' back to me.."</i>

470
00:49:08,748 --> 00:49:11,043
<i>"or thought I did."</i>

471
00:49:11,752 --> 00:49:16,174
<i>"I found myself crouching
over Sally Swanger's well.."</i>

472
00:49:21,764 --> 00:49:25,101
<i>".. like a madwoman
staring into its secrets."</i>

473
00:49:27,269 --> 00:49:32,777
<i>"Was it you I saw walking home to me,
or was it your ghost?</i>

474
00:49:32,778 --> 00:49:36,906
<i>"After so long, I know I must learn
to survive on my own</i>

475
00:49:37,281 --> 00:49:40,284
<i>"and accept you will not return.</i>

476
00:49:40,285 --> 00:49:43,664
<i>And yet I cannot. I cannot."</i>

477
00:49:49,213 --> 00:49:51,466
Them cows wants milkin'.

478
00:49:51,632 --> 00:49:54,886
If that letter ain't urgent,
them cows is is what I'm sayin'.

479
00:49:54,969 --> 00:49:57,013
I don't know you.

480
00:49:57,223 --> 00:50:00,225
Old lady Swanger says you need help.

481
00:50:00,226 --> 00:50:03,146
Here I am.

482
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:08,193
I.. I need help but.. I need..
I do need help, but I need a laborer.

483
00:50:08,236 --> 00:50:13,240
There's.. there's plowing and rough work.
I think there's been a misunderstanding.

484
00:50:13,241 --> 00:50:16,120
What's that rake for?

485
00:50:16,579 --> 00:50:17,776
The rake?

486
00:50:17,789 --> 00:50:18,996
Well, it ain't for
gardenin', that's for sure.

487
00:50:18,997 --> 00:50:22,626
Number one, you got a horse?
I can plow all day. I'm a worker.

488
00:50:23,086 --> 00:50:25,547
Number two, ain't no man better'n me,

489
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:29,885
'cause there ain't no man around
who ain't old or full of mischief.

490
00:50:31,096 --> 00:50:34,598
- I know your plight.
- My plight?

491
00:50:34,599 --> 00:50:38,145
Am I hard to hear?
'Cause you keep repeatin' everything.

492
00:50:38,186 --> 00:50:41,817
I ain't lookin' for money. I never cared
for it and now it ain't worth nothin'.

493
00:50:42,190 --> 00:50:45,404
I expect to board and eat,
at the same table.

494
00:50:45,696 --> 00:50:48,700
- I ain't a servant, if you get my meanin'.
- You're not a servant.

495
00:50:48,701 --> 00:50:53,370
People's gonna have to empty
their own night jars is my point.

496
00:50:53,704 --> 00:50:56,207
And I don't expect to work
whilst you sit around and watch, neither.

497
00:50:56,208 --> 00:50:57,335
Right.

498
00:50:57,377 --> 00:51:00,171
Right. Is that a yes or a no?

499
00:51:02,966 --> 00:51:05,968
There's a rooster.
He's the devil, I'm sure of it.

500
00:51:05,969 --> 00:51:08,515
I go near him
and he is at me with his spurs.

501
00:51:08,972 --> 00:51:10,974
He's Lucifer himself.

502
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:14,271
I despise a floggin' rooster.

503
00:51:15,315 --> 00:51:17,315
Oh, no. I wouldn't..

504
00:51:17,316 --> 00:51:20,319
My name's Ruby Thewes.
I know your name.

505
00:51:29,915 --> 00:51:32,376
Let's put him in a pot.

506
00:51:58,364 --> 00:52:00,117
Urgh!

507
00:52:35,408 --> 00:52:39,829
You're my angel, my butterfly.

508
00:52:41,414 --> 00:52:43,917
Come fly away.

509
00:52:46,421 --> 00:52:49,382
My love..

510
00:52:49,425 --> 00:52:52,427
God forgive me for doin' this.

511
00:52:52,428 --> 00:52:54,680
I'm so sorry.

512
00:52:54,930 --> 00:52:57,726
I'm sendin' you to a better place.

513
00:52:59,435 --> 00:53:02,398
You go fly away.

514
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,359
Hey!

515
00:53:04,443 --> 00:53:06,975
Don't do that.

516
00:53:06,988 --> 00:53:09,531
Don't pull that trigger,
I'm a man of God.

517
00:53:09,948 --> 00:53:14,452
- I killed several of them.
- I mean I'm God's minister.

518
00:53:14,453 --> 00:53:18,458
What part of God's business
is throwin' a woman down a gorge?

519
00:53:18,459 --> 00:53:20,753
A slave woman.

520
00:53:20,962 --> 00:53:24,465
Can you see that in this light?
Black as a bucket of tar.

521
00:53:24,466 --> 00:53:27,469
- Is she dead?
- No, I drugged her.

522
00:53:27,968 --> 00:53:29,971
Like you would a butterfly.

523
00:53:29,972 --> 00:53:32,974
And I care for her.
That's the heartbreak of it.

524
00:53:33,976 --> 00:53:36,978
She's got my bastard in her belly.

525
00:53:36,979 --> 00:53:39,482
Come on. Back up.

526
00:53:41,484 --> 00:53:43,986
- I'm beggin' you.
- Git.

527
00:53:43,987 --> 00:53:49,662
It's better you blow out my brains
than return me to this place.

528
00:53:50,495 --> 00:53:53,625
You're gonna put her back
where she sleeps.

529
00:53:55,001 --> 00:53:58,004
I do that, the members will lynch me

530
00:53:58,005 --> 00:54:00,246
for sirin' a bastard while
servin' as their preacher.

531
00:54:00,259 --> 00:54:02,510
We're a strict congregation.

532
00:54:02,511 --> 00:54:06,224
We've churched men
for pickin' up a fiddle on the Sabbath.

533
00:54:06,516 --> 00:54:09,435
So you reckon to kill her?
What, because she's a slave?

534
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:13,523
I.. um..

535
00:54:13,524 --> 00:54:15,943
There's a back door. Have pity.

536
00:54:18,529 --> 00:54:20,530
Thank you.

537
00:54:20,531 --> 00:54:23,201
I was gonna do a grievous wrong.

538
00:54:26,037 --> 00:54:28,958
I think I should go back up to my wife.

539
00:54:30,543 --> 00:54:32,545
She wakes at the slightest noise.

540
00:54:32,546 --> 00:54:34,505
Agh! Ohh..

541
00:54:34,547 --> 00:54:36,550
Where's some paper and a pencil?

542
00:54:48,064 --> 00:54:51,735
Hey, Ada! You up?

543
00:54:53,070 --> 00:54:54,405
Yes.

544
00:54:54,572 --> 00:54:57,075
Wha..? It's still dark.

545
00:54:57,076 --> 00:54:59,828
Tell that to the cows. It's late.

546
00:55:07,087 --> 00:55:09,088
You all set?

547
00:55:09,089 --> 00:55:11,173
Oh, I-I just have to eat somethin'.

548
00:55:11,591 --> 00:55:14,594
Well, then, you got to get up earlier.
What's that?

549
00:55:16,598 --> 00:55:18,598
A novel.

550
00:55:18,599 --> 00:55:21,938
You wanna carry a book,
carry one you can write in.

551
00:55:23,606 --> 00:55:29,863
We got our own story.
It's called "Black Cove Farm: Catastrophe".

552
00:55:30,863 --> 00:55:35,285
I can spell it, too. Learned it the
same place you did, in the schoolhouse.

553
00:55:35,370 --> 00:55:37,872
One of the first words they taught me.

554
00:55:37,873 --> 00:55:43,294
"Ruby Thewes,
you are a c-a-t-a-s-t-r-o-p-h-e."

555
00:55:43,295 --> 00:55:45,966
Three years I was in school,
before my daddy..

556
00:55:46,383 --> 00:55:49,719
Sayin' God rest his soul is like
wishin' him what he had in life.

557
00:55:49,886 --> 00:55:52,683
He lived to rest. He was born tired.

558
00:55:52,889 --> 00:55:55,351
He decided.. better use for me

559
00:55:55,392 --> 00:55:59,149
than havin' me sat all day
in front of a chalkboard.

560
00:56:06,405 --> 00:56:11,828
Number one, lay out a winter garden
for cool-season crops.

561
00:56:11,912 --> 00:56:15,416
Turnips right there, onions, cabbage.

562
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:18,920
Collards.

563
00:56:18,921 --> 00:56:22,550
Number two,
patch the shingles on the barn roof.

564
00:56:22,924 --> 00:56:24,926
Have we got a maul and frow?

565
00:56:24,927 --> 00:56:28,766
- Maul?
- Maul. M-a-u-l.

566
00:56:28,932 --> 00:56:32,103
Number three, clear and turn this field.

567
00:56:38,944 --> 00:56:42,532
No harm done lettin' it go.
Now we'll do well.

568
00:56:43,450 --> 00:56:44,366
Number 15..

569
00:56:44,367 --> 00:56:45,286
16.

570
00:56:45,453 --> 00:56:46,869
- Number 16..
- Number 16..

571
00:56:46,953 --> 00:56:51,418
Put up some gourds for a martin colony.
Keep away these crows.

572
00:56:51,459 --> 00:56:56,591
One thing in abundance on this farm,
and that's crows. Shut the gate.

573
00:57:39,849 --> 00:57:42,477
I'd pay a dollar for an egg.

574
00:57:43,603 --> 00:57:46,189
I've got no quarrel with you.

575
00:57:46,190 --> 00:57:47,692
Hey!

576
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:51,822
Am I near the Cape Fear River?

577
00:58:23,734 --> 00:58:26,780
Home Guard! Get back there!

578
00:58:27,155 --> 00:58:28,824
Runaways!

579
00:58:34,246 --> 00:58:36,207
Come on, boys!

580
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:38,920
Let's get 'em!

581
00:58:39,337 --> 00:58:42,130
They're spreadin' out in the field!

582
00:58:46,345 --> 00:58:48,347
- Come back here!
- They're in the field.

583
00:58:48,348 --> 00:58:50,849
They're in the field!

584
00:59:00,778 --> 00:59:03,155
I can get you outta here.

585
00:59:08,786 --> 00:59:11,789
I daresay that's Home Guard followin' you.

586
00:59:11,790 --> 00:59:15,587
They're out on the road,
huntin' down deserters.

587
00:59:15,796 --> 00:59:18,091
And I don't recommend that way.

588
00:59:18,298 --> 00:59:22,095
You'll meet half the town comin' after me
with a noose, thanks to you.

589
00:59:22,303 --> 00:59:24,805
I should have shot you
when I had the chance.

590
00:59:24,806 --> 00:59:29,227
I know where there's a ferry crossin'.
Or you can stubborn yourself to death.

591
00:59:30,729 --> 00:59:33,429
If this is a trap..

592
00:59:33,442 --> 00:59:36,152
Please yourself. I'm
just bein' a Christian.

593
00:59:36,153 --> 00:59:38,739
- You got any money?
- $5.

594
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:42,869
For $5 I wouldn't give a parched man
a dipper of this river water.

595
00:59:42,911 --> 00:59:44,996
The sign says "Ferry $5."

596
00:59:44,997 --> 00:59:49,919
Nobody crosses these waters
unless they're runnin' from someplace.

597
00:59:50,752 --> 00:59:53,257
You wanna wait for your friends?

598
00:59:53,424 --> 00:59:55,633
I can give you $30 Confederate.

599
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:57,845
Well, all right, let's go.

600
00:59:57,846 --> 00:59:59,805
Whatever that's worth.

601
01:00:04,936 --> 01:00:06,981
They cut off my hair.

602
01:00:08,272 --> 01:00:10,902
That was hard.

603
01:00:11,277 --> 01:00:13,322
I was vain about my hair.

604
01:00:14,114 --> 01:00:16,575
I had curls.

605
01:00:17,367 --> 01:00:20,206
But I deserved it.

606
01:00:20,288 --> 01:00:25,128
I'm the Reverend Veasey.
Have I seen you in church?

607
01:00:25,211 --> 01:00:28,005
No. Not likely to, neither.

608
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:32,428
I'd say these days, the
devil rules the roost.

609
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:37,434
30 more dollars.
We can go over to that cabin

610
01:00:37,643 --> 01:00:40,771
and I can pull this dress over my head.

611
01:00:42,649 --> 01:00:44,983
Have we got $30?

612
01:00:47,070 --> 01:00:50,908
- Get down!
- I got one.

613
01:00:58,834 --> 01:01:00,845
Is there any other
way to cross?

614
01:01:00,858 --> 01:01:02,879
Barge or boat. The
water's full of gators.

615
01:01:04,507 --> 01:01:06,507
What's this wood?

616
01:01:06,508 --> 01:01:09,012
- I don't know.
- In.

617
01:01:10,013 --> 01:01:11,515
- I don't know.
- Pine.

618
01:01:11,516 --> 01:01:15,017
- Locust?
- Pine. Where's north?

619
01:01:15,018 --> 01:01:18,022
North? Uh..

620
01:01:19,022 --> 01:01:21,734
Name me three herbs
that grow wild on this farm.

621
01:01:22,026 --> 01:01:24,529
I can't. I can't, all right?

622
01:01:25,781 --> 01:01:29,161
I can talk about farming in Latin.

623
01:01:29,286 --> 01:01:32,788
I can.. I can read French.

624
01:01:32,789 --> 01:01:35,668
I know how to lace up a corset.
God knows.

625
01:01:36,044 --> 01:01:38,046
I can name the principal rivers in Europe.

626
01:01:38,047 --> 01:01:41,548
Just don't ask me
to name one stream in this county!

627
01:01:41,549 --> 01:01:44,679
I can.. I can embroider
but I can't darn!

628
01:01:45,054 --> 01:01:49,142
I can arrange cut flowers
but I can't grow them!

629
01:01:51,061 --> 01:01:54,023
If a thing has a function,
if I might do something with it,

630
01:01:54,065 --> 01:01:57,527
then it wasn't considered suitable!

631
01:01:59,988 --> 01:02:01,992
Why?

632
01:02:03,910 --> 01:02:07,413
Ruby, you can ask why about
pretty much everything to do with me.

633
01:02:11,418 --> 01:02:15,839
This fence is about the first thing
that I've ever done

634
01:02:15,924 --> 01:02:18,930
that might produce an actual result.

635
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:33,111
So you never wrapped your legs
around this Inman?

636
01:02:34,194 --> 01:02:36,156
Oh!

637
01:02:39,786 --> 01:02:41,746
Come on.

638
01:03:26,423 --> 01:03:28,092
Fine piano.

639
01:03:53,956 --> 01:03:57,710
If we're careful,
now we'll get through winter.

640
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:00,379
I got old man Roy
to give me ten of them sheep,

641
01:04:00,463 --> 01:04:02,424
on account of I said they's so small,

642
01:04:02,465 --> 01:04:06,220
put together they weren't no bigger
than six proper sheep.

643
01:04:06,387 --> 01:04:09,558
My father
always wanted sheep on this farm.

644
01:04:12,896 --> 01:04:15,480
I cut off my hair once for money.

645
01:04:15,481 --> 01:04:21,364
My daddy got $2 for it.
Made a wig for some rich feller in Raleigh.

646
01:04:23,742 --> 01:04:26,828
I'm just sayin'
I'm real sorry you had to lose your piano.

647
01:04:26,829 --> 01:04:28,788
Ruby, it was my idea.

648
01:04:28,830 --> 01:04:31,961
Stobrod liked to call himself a musician.

649
01:04:32,418 --> 01:04:36,921
My daddy.
He could play six tunes on a fiddle.

650
01:04:36,922 --> 01:04:40,429
Got hisself shot dead at Petersburg.

651
01:04:41,428 --> 01:04:43,930
I was like his goat.

652
01:04:43,931 --> 01:04:46,433
Or some critter tethered to a post.

653
01:04:50,438 --> 01:04:53,401
He left me once.
Up in them mountains.

654
01:04:53,442 --> 01:04:55,693
I was eight.
He was gone over two and a half weeks.

655
01:04:55,694 --> 01:04:57,991
He left you?

656
01:05:00,535 --> 01:05:03,704
Uh-huh. I was all right.

657
01:05:04,037 --> 01:05:09,838
My daddy, he'd walk 40 miles for liquor
and not 40 inches for kindness.

658
01:05:11,631 --> 01:05:14,341
I'm so plugged up.

659
01:05:14,634 --> 01:05:18,221
Used to be as regular as morning prayers.

660
01:05:18,222 --> 01:05:21,892
Matter of fact,
I could set my watch by my bowels.

661
01:05:23,479 --> 01:05:30,151
Open my gut now, they'd find turds
stacked up like little black twigs.

662
01:05:31,738 --> 01:05:33,699
Home Guard!

663
01:05:47,422 --> 01:05:49,382
- Hey.
- Shh.

664
01:05:49,424 --> 01:05:52,428
- Look at this.
- Keep your voice down.

665
01:05:53,932 --> 01:05:55,934
Look at this!

666
01:05:57,517 --> 01:06:00,147
- It's a good saw!
- And it's not yours.

667
01:06:01,856 --> 01:06:05,902
You're a Christian.
Don't you know your Commandments?

668
01:06:06,612 --> 01:06:11,576
You'll find the good Lord
very flexible on the subject of property.

669
01:06:12,619 --> 01:06:15,331
We could do a lot with this saw.

670
01:06:15,706 --> 01:06:19,753
Cut down a tree.
Play music with it.

671
01:06:21,213 --> 01:06:23,507
You're gonna thank me for this saw.

672
01:06:23,714 --> 01:06:27,218
I'll say thank you when I've lost you
and I've found some food.

673
01:06:27,219 --> 01:06:29,430
You'll see.
You'll thank me.

674
01:06:41,318 --> 01:06:43,238
Shh.

675
01:06:47,827 --> 01:06:49,829
Good day to you.

676
01:06:56,838 --> 01:07:01,844
My old bull.. wandered off..
and died in this here creek.

677
01:07:01,845 --> 01:07:05,347
Poisonin' up our water
is how I found him.

678
01:07:08,852 --> 01:07:11,646
Thank you.
You are a true Christian.

679
01:07:12,773 --> 01:07:17,403
- That's a rank odor from that animal.
- Been dead a good while, I reckon.

680
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:20,782
This is a tricky one.

681
01:07:23,285 --> 01:07:27,249
You fellers help me out,
my woman'll cook you up a good dinner.

682
01:07:27,791 --> 01:07:30,084
I'm gettin' an idea.

683
01:07:31,295 --> 01:07:33,505
My saw's the remedy.

684
01:07:33,797 --> 01:07:37,302
I believe you need two people,
one on either end.

685
01:07:37,303 --> 01:07:38,802
Yeah.

686
01:07:38,803 --> 01:07:40,806
Give me that saw.

687
01:07:46,812 --> 01:07:48,315
Let's do this in chapters.

688
01:07:48,316 --> 01:07:49,815
- That's right.
- Yeah.

689
01:07:49,816 --> 01:07:52,612
Start at the neck.

690
01:07:53,238 --> 01:07:55,199
Aw..!

691
01:07:57,742 --> 01:08:00,286
Oh, well.. That is unpleasant.

692
01:08:01,915 --> 01:08:04,376
There's my place.

693
01:08:04,417 --> 01:08:08,047
Hope you can stomach
a yard chock full of female.

694
01:08:08,421 --> 01:08:11,425
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

695
01:08:11,426 --> 01:08:12,927
Hallelujah.

696
01:08:12,928 --> 01:08:17,931
Hallelujah! Oh, hallelujah!
The Israelites!

697
01:08:17,932 --> 01:08:19,518
What happened?

698
01:08:19,935 --> 01:08:21,937
He's got a shit comin'.
It's overdue.

699
01:08:21,938 --> 01:08:27,735
The tribes of lsrael are about to flee
from the banks of Egypt!

700
01:08:28,946 --> 01:08:30,446
Good God.

701
01:08:30,447 --> 01:08:33,243
These boys are stoppin' for supper!

702
01:08:39,458 --> 01:08:40,959
Brought my woman home,

703
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:45,463
she showed up with her three sisters,
so-called, and their brats.

704
01:08:45,464 --> 01:08:47,759
That's Mae, Dolly, Shyla,

705
01:08:47,969 --> 01:08:50,805
and the pretty one in
blue is my wife, Lila.

706
01:08:53,474 --> 01:08:55,770
Those are fine examples of the female.

707
01:09:11,996 --> 01:09:15,000
Oh, I'm about to pass out.

708
01:09:15,001 --> 01:09:20,506
My home brew sneaks up on you.
It curdles your durdles.

709
01:09:21,008 --> 01:09:23,509
Oh. Oh, look. He's gone now.

710
01:09:23,510 --> 01:09:25,513
Look. He's gone now.

711
01:09:26,514 --> 01:09:28,514
His eyes, they've gone.

712
01:09:28,515 --> 01:09:31,311
- His eyes are gone.
- What?

713
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:35,607
Gone, gone, gone, gone!

714
01:09:39,028 --> 01:09:42,991
I'm leavin' soon as I'm full.
Y'all havin' too much fun for me.

715
01:09:43,034 --> 01:09:44,869
Really? Goodbye.

716
01:09:45,035 --> 01:09:48,539
Well, yeah.
I got a bunch of traps need visitin',

717
01:09:48,540 --> 01:09:52,169
but I'll be back before..
before dark tomorrow.

718
01:09:52,545 --> 01:09:56,047
- Y'all still be here?
- That's my fervent prayer.

719
01:09:56,048 --> 01:09:59,886
I'll say my goodbyes.
I gotta go.

720
01:10:00,053 --> 01:10:06,561
I got miles and miles and miles and miles
ahead of me before I reach the Blue Ridge.

721
01:10:06,562 --> 01:10:08,814
Blue Ridge? What's the hurry?

722
01:10:09,063 --> 01:10:12,527
- Maybe I will just lie down a moment.
- Yeah.

723
01:10:12,568 --> 01:10:17,073
- This house is on a bit of a tilt.
- Yeah, it is a bit crooked.

724
01:10:21,579 --> 01:10:23,079
Lie down.

725
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:25,083
What about you, Reverend?

726
01:10:26,586 --> 01:10:29,586
I'm headin' for that smokehouse.

727
01:10:29,587 --> 01:10:31,925
And I'm ready
to be washed clean of my dirt.

728
01:10:32,091 --> 01:10:35,093
- Yeah, Mae, you go tend to him.
- Mm-hm.

729
01:10:35,094 --> 01:10:36,096
All right.

730
01:10:36,597 --> 01:10:39,098
Y'all get to bed.

731
01:10:39,099 --> 01:10:41,602
Everybody else got their job.

732
01:10:41,603 --> 01:10:43,604
- Come on, get to bed.
- Now?

733
01:10:43,605 --> 01:10:47,108
Everybody to bed.
Lila, you stay with them kids.

734
01:10:47,109 --> 01:10:49,403
Get on up those stairs.

735
01:10:49,612 --> 01:10:51,487
I'll be seein' you.

736
01:10:52,114 --> 01:10:55,201
Look..

737
01:10:55,618 --> 01:10:59,582
He's mine.
You go rub yourself off on the preacher.

738
01:10:59,624 --> 01:11:03,127
I'm gonna make him hug me till I grunt.

739
01:11:03,128 --> 01:11:06,005
He's purty, ain't he?

740
01:11:06,632 --> 01:11:08,758
Git.

741
01:11:09,134 --> 01:11:12,139
She ain't even supposed to get a man.

742
01:11:14,140 --> 01:11:16,101
Hey.

743
01:11:23,652 --> 01:11:25,654
I know. I know.

744
01:11:27,156 --> 01:11:29,160
I..

745
01:11:30,659 --> 01:11:32,661
How about that?

746
01:11:32,662 --> 01:11:35,666
- What does that favor?
- I..

747
01:11:37,167 --> 01:11:40,337
- ..gotta go.
- Get on.

748
01:11:40,672 --> 01:11:45,010
And ride me all the way to China.

749
01:11:57,691 --> 01:11:59,192
You shy?

750
01:11:59,193 --> 01:12:01,695
- Do you need a hand?
- No. Uh..

751
01:12:01,696 --> 01:12:04,992
Let's have a look
and see what we can muster.

752
01:12:05,701 --> 01:12:08,704
Oh, no.
Look what you made me do.

753
01:12:11,208 --> 01:12:13,126
Slut!

754
01:12:13,210 --> 01:12:15,210
Home Guard!

755
01:12:15,211 --> 01:12:16,921
Cover yourself up!

756
01:12:17,213 --> 01:12:20,011
I told you, you don't touch the money!

757
01:12:25,223 --> 01:12:29,188
I had a special prayer you'd come visit.

758
01:12:29,229 --> 01:12:31,231
- Get up.
- Evenin', Hank.

759
01:12:31,232 --> 01:12:32,899
Evenin', Hank.

760
01:12:33,734 --> 01:12:36,863
- You took your time.
- I said get up!

761
01:12:37,739 --> 01:12:41,743
Get in line.
You fools fall for it every time.

762
01:12:43,745 --> 01:12:46,749
God will judge you, you Judas.

763
01:12:46,750 --> 01:12:50,170
- Thanks.
- God will judge you!

764
01:12:50,253 --> 01:12:54,926
- Move out!
- Our lives are on your rotten soul.

765
01:12:55,259 --> 01:12:56,760
- Mister?
- Your rotten soul!

766
01:12:56,761 --> 01:12:58,764
Shut your mouth!

767
01:13:00,766 --> 01:13:03,603
- Pleasure doin' business with you, boys.
- Judas!

768
01:13:03,770 --> 01:13:05,563
Save your breath.

769
01:13:05,772 --> 01:13:08,440
You got a long walk back to the fightin'.

770
01:13:13,781 --> 01:13:16,783
Ada Monroe and Ruby Thewes,
look at you both.

771
01:13:16,784 --> 01:13:18,203
Look at us both what?

772
01:13:18,286 --> 01:13:20,789
Like a couple of scarecrows
after a thunderstorm.

773
01:13:20,790 --> 01:13:24,961
We need a scarecrow.
Birds done ate up half our winter garden.

774
01:13:25,294 --> 01:13:29,257
For all your kindness, coffee.. and a pie.

775
01:13:29,299 --> 01:13:32,040
Yeah, and that's real coffee.
It ain't chicory and dirt.

776
01:13:32,053 --> 01:13:34,804
Found a sack hid in the larder.

777
01:13:34,805 --> 01:13:35,806
Mmm.

778
01:13:35,807 --> 01:13:37,600
Thank you both.

779
01:13:37,809 --> 01:13:41,774
Ruby, I look forward to this.
We all do.

780
01:13:41,815 --> 01:13:43,481
Esco and me.

781
01:13:44,316 --> 01:13:47,405
- She made it.
- I made it.

782
01:13:48,823 --> 01:13:51,118
Good God in heaven.

783
01:13:51,325 --> 01:13:54,120
I'm still livin'.

784
01:13:54,244 --> 01:13:58,585
Well, I know Esco's
gonna be real sorry he missed you.

785
01:14:10,096 --> 01:14:11,431
Yep.

786
01:14:16,105 --> 01:14:19,024
- Strike you as odd?
- What?

787
01:14:19,107 --> 01:14:23,530
- Stood at her front door.
- I know.

788
01:14:23,614 --> 01:14:27,743
Number one, I knowed that woman all my
life, I never stood outside her house.

789
01:14:28,118 --> 01:14:31,121
She'd let a wolf in if
it knocked at the door.

790
01:14:31,122 --> 01:14:32,875
Perhaps..

791
01:14:33,124 --> 01:14:35,419
I don't know.
Perhaps she was busy.

792
01:14:35,627 --> 01:14:41,132
Number two, old man Swanger's inside
that house. I could smell his pipe burnin'.

793
01:14:41,133 --> 01:14:45,722
- Number three, look at them fields.
- What about them?

794
01:14:46,139 --> 01:14:50,144
We come by here a week ago
and they was waist-high in hay.

795
01:14:50,145 --> 01:14:54,357
You tellin' me
that's work for one old man and his dog?

796
01:15:02,075 --> 01:15:04,203
Yankees! Yankees!

797
01:15:04,661 --> 01:15:07,081
Cavalry! Federal raiders!

798
01:15:07,082 --> 01:15:09,084
Just over that hill.

799
01:15:09,584 --> 01:15:12,546
- Get those sacks of shit up that hill.
- Come on!

800
01:15:19,762 --> 01:15:24,434
Get those horses under cover.
If they see us, we're dead.

801
01:15:25,018 --> 01:15:27,940
Make a move, make a noise..

802
01:16:02,593 --> 01:16:04,886
I'm gettin' out of this.

803
01:16:05,178 --> 01:16:09,594
I'm not gettin' shot again
for some cause I don't believe in.

804
01:16:09,595 --> 01:16:11,427
Come on, let's go.

805
01:16:11,637 --> 01:16:13,554
Come on. They can't shoot.
Come on.

806
01:16:17,470 --> 01:16:19,346
Keep goin'! Come on!

807
01:16:19,389 --> 01:16:22,138
Bayonets.

808
01:16:23,263 --> 01:16:25,140
Come on!

809
01:16:54,604 --> 01:16:59,107
Grab their boots
and rifles! Let's move on!

810
01:16:59,398 --> 01:17:01,356
Let's go!

811
01:17:16,652 --> 01:17:20,319
That scarecrow
ain't gonna frighten off no Yankee.

812
01:17:20,652 --> 01:17:23,568
Or are you tryin'
to make a man for yourself?

813
01:17:23,652 --> 01:17:25,151
No.

814
01:17:27,154 --> 01:17:31,154
I come by.. a few days.

815
01:17:31,155 --> 01:17:33,654
I don't pass by.

816
01:17:33,655 --> 01:17:36,906
- Lookin' out for you.
- I know.

817
01:17:38,657 --> 01:17:40,740
I see you.

818
01:17:41,825 --> 01:17:45,074
- And I don't like it.
- Where's your little servant girl?

819
01:17:45,409 --> 01:17:49,117
Ruby. She tradin' off
more of your daddy's silver?

820
01:17:49,118 --> 01:17:51,617
- Stop it!
- Her nose is in the butter.

821
01:17:51,659 --> 01:17:54,327
Her nose is right in your butter!

822
01:18:04,161 --> 01:18:06,622
This farm's got my name on it!

823
01:18:06,747 --> 01:18:10,414
You listenin', woman?
You're gonna need more than a scarecrow!

824
01:19:39,059 --> 01:19:41,019
Sal.

825
01:19:51,562 --> 01:19:53,562
Afternoon.

826
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:58,147
Don't spread out.
Why are they spreadin' out?

827
01:19:59,023 --> 01:20:01,772
I never seen a man work a field
with a shotgun before.

828
01:20:02,022 --> 01:20:03,063
There's a war on.

829
01:20:03,064 --> 01:20:05,148
Get off my land.

830
01:20:06,314 --> 01:20:09,649
- Your boys come home?
- Ain't seen my boys in four years.

831
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:12,691
They're out fightin' other boys,
not old men and women.

832
01:20:12,858 --> 01:20:15,192
So you won't mind if we look around?

833
01:20:15,193 --> 01:20:17,443
'Cause we think they're here.

834
01:20:17,734 --> 01:20:20,443
We think you've got 'em
hid up somewhere.

835
01:20:20,693 --> 01:20:24,903
What I gotta give you?
Chicken? Lamb?

836
01:20:26,152 --> 01:20:27,863
Sure.

837
01:20:28,155 --> 01:20:31,154
The thing is, you've only got one barrel.

838
01:20:31,155 --> 01:20:34,946
And there's five of us.
That's not a fair fight.

839
01:20:38,864 --> 01:20:40,782
King of kings!

840
01:20:41,491 --> 01:20:42,200
Hey!

841
01:20:44,281 --> 01:20:45,241
What was that?

842
01:20:46,908 --> 01:20:49,410
Aargh!

843
01:20:49,493 --> 01:20:53,450
You're harboring deserters. I could
confiscate this farm and everything on it.

844
01:20:53,701 --> 01:20:56,700
Every plate, every sheep,
every little pellet of chickenshit.

845
01:20:56,701 --> 01:20:58,952
I could confiscate your old lady's asshole.

846
01:20:59,203 --> 01:21:00,828
So don't you offer me no bird.

847
01:21:23,457 --> 01:21:26,333
Come on, boys!

848
01:21:26,458 --> 01:21:28,334
Mama's callin'!

849
01:21:36,169 --> 01:21:37,252
Mama!

850
01:21:37,253 --> 01:21:40,044
No!

851
01:21:40,170 --> 01:21:42,756
Mama! Mama!

852
01:21:44,755 --> 01:21:46,754
No!

853
01:22:23,805 --> 01:22:26,681
Buggery and shit!

854
01:22:26,807 --> 01:22:32,807
If I'da known you were this heavy,
I'da left you in those chains.

855
01:22:50,936 --> 01:22:52,936
Sally!

856
01:22:54,020 --> 01:22:55,770
No!

857
01:22:56,397 --> 01:22:58,313
No!

858
01:22:59,771 --> 01:23:01,230
Oh, God. Sally?

859
01:23:01,314 --> 01:23:02,606
Ada!

860
01:23:04,398 --> 01:23:06,399
All right, all right!

861
01:23:09,232 --> 01:23:11,317
Darlin', what?

862
01:23:12,233 --> 01:23:14,982
She's sayin' "Don't bother"! Go!

863
01:23:19,568 --> 01:23:21,608
Get her neck!

864
01:23:21,651 --> 01:23:24,277
- Sally!
- Get her neck.

865
01:23:28,153 --> 01:23:31,652
This world won't stand long.

866
01:23:31,653 --> 01:23:34,570
God won't let it..

867
01:23:34,653 --> 01:23:37,572
stand this way long.

868
01:23:43,156 --> 01:23:49,157
- How long have I been sleepin'?
- Two days, three days. Not long enough.

869
01:23:49,158 --> 01:23:53,117
- I can't stop here.
- Sit down before you fall down.

870
01:23:53,158 --> 01:23:55,660
I'm a deserter.

871
01:23:55,661 --> 01:23:58,993
If they find me here,
things could be bad for you.

872
01:23:59,159 --> 01:24:01,703
What are they gonna do?
Cut short my young life?

873
01:24:10,663 --> 01:24:14,371
I've learned a person
can pretty much survive off of a goat.

874
01:24:14,663 --> 01:24:17,163
A goat gives you company,

875
01:24:17,164 --> 01:24:18,955
and milk,

876
01:24:19,165 --> 01:24:20,832
and cheese,

877
01:24:20,833 --> 01:24:23,583
and, when you need it,

878
01:24:23,917 --> 01:24:25,707
good meat.

879
01:24:28,417 --> 01:24:30,419
That's my beauty.

880
01:24:30,918 --> 01:24:33,167
There's my beauty.

881
01:24:33,918 --> 01:24:36,501
So you been fightin'.

882
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:41,796
I could be at killin'..

883
01:24:41,921 --> 01:24:43,753
for days,

884
01:24:44,670 --> 01:24:48,132
my feet against the feet of my enemy.

885
01:24:49,171 --> 01:24:51,505
And I always killed him.

886
01:24:55,172 --> 01:24:56,965
He never killed me.

887
01:24:56,966 --> 01:24:58,965
I don't know why.

888
01:25:00,549 --> 01:25:03,633
Gave it a try, to look at ya.

889
01:25:05,552 --> 01:25:07,549
Yeah, I guess he did.

890
01:25:07,550 --> 01:25:09,342
See, I think there's a plan.

891
01:25:09,343 --> 01:25:11,884
There's a design
for each and every one of us.

892
01:25:12,344 --> 01:25:13,844
You look at nature.

893
01:25:13,845 --> 01:25:18,344
Bird flies somewhere, picks up a seed,
shits the seed out, plant grows.

894
01:25:18,345 --> 01:25:22,389
Bird's got a job,
shit's got a job, seed's got a job.

895
01:25:25,390 --> 01:25:28,513
And you've got a job.

896
01:25:28,888 --> 01:25:31,223
You done good, goat.

897
01:25:31,889 --> 01:25:34,224
You were a real beauty.

898
01:25:46,892 --> 01:25:50,726
Sometimes I think I'm crazy
when I'm just hungry.

899
01:25:50,727 --> 01:25:55,436
Now drink this.
It eases the pain, and you'll sleep.

900
01:26:02,355 --> 01:26:06,355
Is she waitin' for ya,
this Ada Monroe?

901
01:26:06,356 --> 01:26:08,565
She was.

902
01:26:08,856 --> 01:26:11,355
I don't know.

903
01:26:11,356 --> 01:26:14,692
Or even if she knows me.

904
01:26:14,859 --> 01:26:17,609
Lie down.

905
01:26:17,859 --> 01:26:19,859
I'm like the boy
who goes for wood in winter

906
01:26:19,860 --> 01:26:23,027
and comes back in spring with a whistle.

907
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:28,694
Like every fool sent off to fight
with a flag and a lie.

908
01:26:31,361 --> 01:26:36,030
That's the laudanum gettin' to ya.
That's good.

909
01:26:36,363 --> 01:26:38,365
Say somethin' more.

910
01:26:42,866 --> 01:26:44,866
She got me a book.

911
01:26:46,364 --> 01:26:48,365
Ada Monroe.

912
01:26:50,867 --> 01:26:53,033
A man by the name of Bartram.

913
01:26:55,366 --> 01:26:57,575
He wrote about his travels.

914
01:26:58,367 --> 01:27:00,825
Sometimes..

915
01:27:00,826 --> 01:27:03,827
just readin' the name of a place..

916
01:27:05,410 --> 01:27:07,411
near home..

917
01:27:11,413 --> 01:27:13,413
Sorell Cove.

918
01:27:15,413 --> 01:27:17,414
Bishop's Creek.

919
01:27:18,913 --> 01:27:22,375
Those places
belonged to people before us.

920
01:27:23,415 --> 01:27:25,415
To the Cherokee.

921
01:27:25,416 --> 01:27:29,418
What did he call Cold Mountain?

922
01:27:31,917 --> 01:27:37,543
How could a name..
not even a real name..

923
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:42,253
break your heart?

924
01:27:46,420 --> 01:27:48,421
It's her.

925
01:27:50,421 --> 01:27:54,089
She's the place I'm headin'.

926
01:27:55,925 --> 01:27:59,840
And I hardly know her.
I hardly know her!

927
01:28:03,924 --> 01:28:07,507
And I just can't seem to get back to her.

928
01:28:11,926 --> 01:28:16,635
<i>"To have traveled so far,
from east to west,</i>

929
01:28:16,927 --> 01:28:19,221
<i>a thousand terrible miles."</i>

930
01:28:19,428 --> 01:28:21,427
I have to close my eyes.

931
01:28:21,428 --> 01:28:24,387
<i>"My feet treadin' all God's surface -</i>

932
01:28:24,429 --> 01:28:28,764
<i>"his ocean, his swamps,
his slopes and ridges -</i>

933
01:28:28,931 --> 01:28:34,889
<i>"to find myself, at last,
a mark in the aching snow,</i>

934
01:28:34,931 --> 01:28:37,432
<i>"from whence I beheld
through a blue haze</i>

935
01:28:37,433 --> 01:28:41,475
a world of mountains
piled upon mountains."

936
01:28:42,433 --> 01:28:44,434
Ada!

937
01:28:45,935 --> 01:28:47,934
Ada!

938
01:28:52,435 --> 01:28:54,144
- It's a man!
- What is?

939
01:28:54,145 --> 01:28:58,687
Raidin' our corncrib!
Got him in the trap! That's him yelpin'!

940
01:29:00,937 --> 01:29:03,437
- Help!
- Here.

941
01:29:03,438 --> 01:29:06,106
Help! Damn.

942
01:29:06,940 --> 01:29:09,022
Listen up!

943
01:29:09,439 --> 01:29:10,940
You got.. Aim!

944
01:29:10,941 --> 01:29:13,316
You got a barrel trained on your rear end!

945
01:29:13,441 --> 01:29:16,482
- Get me outta this dang thing!
- You got a weapon?

946
01:29:16,483 --> 01:29:21,441
No, ma'am, I'm..
My fists are about to drop off.

947
01:29:21,442 --> 01:29:24,235
Unbelievable.

948
01:29:25,318 --> 01:29:28,277
- Stobrod Thewes!
- Ruby?

949
01:29:29,194 --> 01:29:31,653
Agh!

950
01:29:33,779 --> 01:29:36,112
That's my daddy.

951
01:29:37,278 --> 01:29:40,405
Just so's you know,
I can eat while she's doin' this.

952
01:29:40,863 --> 01:29:43,363
Just so's you know,
you ain't eatin' inside.

953
01:29:43,364 --> 01:29:48,324
Number one, they hang people round here
for takin' in deserters.

954
01:29:48,366 --> 01:29:52,449
Number two,
even if they was givin' out prizes,

955
01:29:52,866 --> 01:29:55,367
you'd still eat outside.

956
01:29:55,368 --> 01:29:57,660
- You're scarred.
- I'm what?

957
01:29:57,866 --> 01:30:00,702
Your heart. Scarred.
I did wrong to ya.

958
01:30:00,868 --> 01:30:02,857
You'd be scarred. You'd
be real scarred if I

959
01:30:02,870 --> 01:30:04,869
hadn't wrapped them
trap teeth in sackin'.

960
01:30:04,870 --> 01:30:08,495
- Which was my idea.
- Which was her idea.

961
01:30:09,370 --> 01:30:12,538
- I hurt you.
- Good God.

962
01:30:12,870 --> 01:30:16,080
I made up 50 tunes with you in mind.

963
01:30:16,372 --> 01:30:19,371
Ruby this. Ruby that.
Ruby with the eyes that sparkle.

964
01:30:19,372 --> 01:30:22,164
Hey! Let's agree.

965
01:30:22,374 --> 01:30:26,374
You beat me,
you abandoned me, you ignored me,

966
01:30:26,375 --> 01:30:28,041
then you beat me some more.

967
01:30:28,375 --> 01:30:32,874
And all of that is better'n
"Ruby with the eyes that sparkle."

968
01:30:32,875 --> 01:30:35,669
I'm changed. People change.

969
01:30:35,751 --> 01:30:37,750
War changes people somethin' terrible.

970
01:30:37,751 --> 01:30:40,545
Ruby's told you, I've no doubt,
I wasn't always the best.

971
01:30:40,752 --> 01:30:42,751
You were an asshole!

972
01:30:42,752 --> 01:30:44,794
I can't disagree with that,
I was.

973
01:30:45,753 --> 01:30:49,254
- Would you get him outta here?
- Music's changed me.

974
01:30:49,255 --> 01:30:51,255
I'm full of music, Ruby.

975
01:30:51,754 --> 01:30:53,796
I wish I'd brung my fiddle.

976
01:30:53,921 --> 01:30:55,921
Hey, Ruby. I got a new fiddle.

977
01:30:55,922 --> 01:30:58,641
Oh, it's a beautiful fiddle.
It's full of tunes.

978
01:30:58,654 --> 01:31:01,383
Ruby, I didn't know
I had it in me.

979
01:31:01,425 --> 01:31:04,674
- You're all set.
- I..

980
01:31:12,426 --> 01:31:15,094
Bless you both.

981
01:31:18,177 --> 01:31:20,137
All right, then.

982
01:31:25,179 --> 01:31:27,388
Ain't you got a proper coat?

983
01:31:28,346 --> 01:31:30,606
Aw, darlin', I'm fine, you know.
And you just

984
01:31:30,619 --> 01:31:32,890
say the word, I won't
come back neither.

985
01:31:33,224 --> 01:31:35,723
Don't wanna put you or your mistress here
in any bother.

986
01:31:35,724 --> 01:31:38,516
I'm not Ruby's employer.

987
01:31:38,683 --> 01:31:40,599
Oh. Beg pardon.

988
01:31:40,641 --> 01:31:42,475
Nobody is.

989
01:31:42,809 --> 01:31:44,809
Oh.

990
01:31:52,811 --> 01:31:56,728
You know who really needs a coat, darlin'?
My partner. Fat boy name of Pangle.

991
01:31:56,894 --> 01:31:59,395
We're hidin' up in a cave
with a singer from Georgia,

992
01:31:59,396 --> 01:32:04,354
and Pangle, he feels the cold like a thin
man, but there ain't no coat'll fit him.

993
01:32:08,772 --> 01:32:10,189
I love you, Ruby.

994
01:32:12,649 --> 01:32:16,232
In case the sky falls on our head.

995
01:32:16,650 --> 01:32:19,190
You always were a good girl.

996
01:32:29,403 --> 01:32:34,444
Ooh! He's so full of manure, that man.

997
01:32:34,445 --> 01:32:38,363
We could lay him in the dirt and..
grow another one just like him.

998
01:32:39,446 --> 01:32:42,362
That's medicine, that's goat meat.

999
01:32:43,447 --> 01:32:45,655
And you're sick of both.

1000
01:32:45,947 --> 01:32:49,365
I have a deal to thank you for.

1001
01:32:49,450 --> 01:32:52,199
That's just for show.

1002
01:34:02,382 --> 01:34:04,883
Get on back where you came from!

1003
01:34:05,007 --> 01:34:07,549
- Thank you for my coat!
- Thanks for the food!

1004
01:34:07,592 --> 01:34:10,549
Git!

1005
01:34:10,550 --> 01:34:14,593
I love my coat!

1006
01:34:26,887 --> 01:34:31,638
<i>"My love for Linton
is like the foliage in the woods.</i>

1007
01:34:31,889 --> 01:34:37,307
<i>"Time will change it, I'm well aware,
as winter changes the trees.</i>

1008
01:34:37,390 --> 01:34:42,681
<i>"My love for Heathcliff
resembles the eternal rocks beneath.</i>

1009
01:34:43,224 --> 01:34:46,392
"A source of little visible delight,

1010
01:34:46,726 --> 01:34:48,893
"but necessary.

1011
01:34:50,268 --> 01:34:52,684
"He's always..

1012
01:34:53,769 --> 01:34:55,767
always in my mind."

1013
01:34:55,768 --> 01:34:58,061
She ain't gonna marry Linton, is she?

1014
01:34:58,354 --> 01:35:02,354
You can't say that about Heathcliff
and then marry Linton.

1015
01:35:02,355 --> 01:35:03,814
Hmm.

1016
01:35:03,855 --> 01:35:06,814
We'll find out.

1017
01:35:09,522 --> 01:35:11,564
Tomorrow.

1018
01:35:11,565 --> 01:35:14,982
I'm not waitin' till tomorrow!

1019
01:35:15,565 --> 01:35:17,399
Ruby..

1020
01:35:17,567 --> 01:35:22,108
"A source of.. little visible delight,

1021
01:35:23,567 --> 01:35:26,319
but.. necessary."

1022
01:35:29,568 --> 01:35:32,695
I like that.

1023
01:35:59,617 --> 01:36:03,618
I'm a Confederate soldier..
on furlough.

1024
01:36:03,869 --> 01:36:06,953
I need shelter.. and food.

1025
01:36:17,538 --> 01:36:19,871
I've got a rifle!

1026
01:36:20,956 --> 01:36:22,914
Fair enough.

1027
01:36:23,956 --> 01:36:26,373
I have some beans and corn pone.

1028
01:36:26,457 --> 01:36:28,622
All I got.

1029
01:36:35,959 --> 01:36:37,958
- Thank you.
- I'm alone here.

1030
01:36:37,959 --> 01:36:40,626
As you can see, with my baby.

1031
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:43,669
I need to believe you mean no harm.

1032
01:36:47,461 --> 01:36:48,961
No.

1033
01:36:49,462 --> 01:36:51,461
I don't want it.

1034
01:36:51,462 --> 01:36:55,255
If I had my way, they'd take metal
altogether out of this world.

1035
01:36:55,462 --> 01:36:57,964
Every blade, every gun.

1036
01:37:12,467 --> 01:37:14,552
It's all right.

1037
01:37:14,966 --> 01:37:17,884
You're burnin' up, little man.

1038
01:37:33,973 --> 01:37:35,974
Is your baby sick?

1039
01:37:38,974 --> 01:37:44,349
My man's dead. Took his wound
at Gettysburg and never saw his boy.

1040
01:37:44,473 --> 01:37:45,474
I'm sorry.

1041
01:37:45,475 --> 01:37:49,435
It's pretty much what you'll get
if you knock on any door of this war.

1042
01:37:49,976 --> 01:37:52,768
Man dead, woman left.

1043
01:37:56,977 --> 01:37:58,729
It's mean food, but it's hot.

1044
01:37:58,976 --> 01:38:02,479
There's been no huntin' on the road,
just cress and roots.

1045
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:05,562
I need to try and feed this man.

1046
01:38:05,979 --> 01:38:09,771
Shh. You gotta eat somethin', baby.

1047
01:38:22,984 --> 01:38:25,607
He won't feed.

1048
01:38:25,984 --> 01:38:29,402
I'm Inman, by the way.
That's my name.

1049
01:38:30,986 --> 01:38:33,068
I'm Sara.

1050
01:38:35,485 --> 01:38:37,029
My baby's Ethan.

1051
01:38:38,987 --> 01:38:40,571
Glad to know you both.

1052
01:38:52,990 --> 01:38:56,199
You look about his size.

1053
01:38:56,491 --> 01:38:59,490
He was another man straight up and down.

1054
01:38:59,491 --> 01:39:01,576
Thank you.

1055
01:39:28,497 --> 01:39:30,290
Everything fit?

1056
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,249
These boots are good boots.

1057
01:39:41,500 --> 01:39:44,169
Well, I'll say good night, then.

1058
01:39:45,501 --> 01:39:47,503
Good night.

1059
01:40:21,011 --> 01:40:23,509
- She don't speak?
- Can't speak! I told you.

1060
01:40:23,510 --> 01:40:25,761
Well, is she feeble, then?

1061
01:40:26,012 --> 01:40:28,346
No!

1062
01:40:28,512 --> 01:40:29,846
Never mind him.

1063
01:40:52,518 --> 01:40:54,517
Will you come inside?

1064
01:41:17,524 --> 01:41:23,900
Would you do somethin' for me?
Do you.. think you could..

1065
01:41:24,024 --> 01:41:28,816
Lie here next to me and not..
need to go further?

1066
01:42:40,043 --> 01:42:44,001
- I'll go, I'll go, shall I?
- No.

1067
01:42:44,043 --> 01:42:46,378
I don't want you to.

1068
01:42:52,545 --> 01:42:54,548
Thing is..

1069
01:42:57,547 --> 01:42:59,548
I love someone.

1070
01:43:05,048 --> 01:43:07,549
I love someone very much.

1071
01:43:26,051 --> 01:43:28,052
Try and sleep.

1072
01:44:52,573 --> 01:44:56,032
- Merry Christmas, Pangle.
- Night, ma'am.

1073
01:44:56,073 --> 01:44:58,530
Merry Christmas, Georgia.
Nice to meet you.

1074
01:44:58,574 --> 01:45:01,867
- Merry Christmas, Miss Ada.
- Merry Christmas.

1075
01:45:02,576 --> 01:45:04,574
- Merry Christmas, darlin'.
- Don't sleep here.

1076
01:45:04,575 --> 01:45:07,700
- We won't.
- It's dangerous. Don't sleep here.

1077
01:45:08,076 --> 01:45:12,076
Oh, it's bitter.
They could stop one night.

1078
01:45:12,077 --> 01:45:14,870
They stop one night,
they're gonna wanna stop two.

1079
01:45:15,078 --> 01:45:17,077
I'll be all right.
This coat's warm.

1080
01:45:17,078 --> 01:45:19,454
What about next Sunday?
It'll be New Year.

1081
01:45:19,580 --> 01:45:23,289
- Maybe.
- Gonna be a better one than 1864.

1082
01:45:23,580 --> 01:45:27,580
- This war's over in a month.
- That's what he said a month ago.

1083
01:45:27,581 --> 01:45:30,039
It started off bein' over in a month.

1084
01:45:30,080 --> 01:45:32,833
Night, Miss Sally.
Merry Christmas.

1085
01:45:33,082 --> 01:45:36,167
- Night, Miss Ruby.
- Night.

1086
01:45:37,082 --> 01:45:38,079
- Night, ma'am.
- Night.

1087
01:45:38,080 --> 01:45:40,584
You're stayin' with us tonight, Sally.

1088
01:45:40,585 --> 01:45:43,584
- That's my Ruby.
- She's an original.

1089
01:45:46,586 --> 01:45:52,085
- What kind of name's Georgia?
- It's where he's from. It's not his name.

1090
01:45:52,086 --> 01:45:57,379
Well, I know it's meant to be
the ugliest state under the heavens.

1091
01:45:57,587 --> 01:46:00,337
Why do you care what his name is?

1092
01:46:01,088 --> 01:46:04,381
Hey, what do you call
that cluster of stars right there?

1093
01:46:04,588 --> 01:46:06,589
Right there.

1094
01:46:06,590 --> 01:46:09,089
Uh.. There? That's Orion.

1095
01:46:09,090 --> 01:46:14,341
And that's Gemini,
and that is Orion's big dog.

1096
01:46:14,590 --> 01:46:16,592
Canis Major.

1097
01:46:16,593 --> 01:46:18,717
Listen to her, Sal.

1098
01:46:19,091 --> 01:46:22,425
She's turned into a regular highland girl.

1099
01:46:22,593 --> 01:46:28,179
Nah, I could always name the stars, Ruby.
That was never my problem.

1100
01:46:31,594 --> 01:46:34,095
I love you, darlin',

1101
01:46:34,096 --> 01:46:37,388
in case that big old sky
falls on our heads.

1102
01:46:37,597 --> 01:46:38,888
Aw..

1103
01:46:42,097 --> 01:46:45,724
And I love you too, Sally.
I do.

1104
01:46:48,599 --> 01:46:51,058
Get up!

1105
01:46:51,099 --> 01:46:54,601
Get up! Get out of here, quick!
The Yankees are coming!

1106
01:46:54,602 --> 01:46:56,434
The Yankees, they're here.

1107
01:46:56,601 --> 01:47:00,560
If they find you here,
things'll go bad on all of us.

1108
01:47:00,603 --> 01:47:04,226
- I can try and fight 'em.
- No. My baby. Please, no. Just..

1109
01:47:04,604 --> 01:47:06,603
Please, just git!

1110
01:47:18,606 --> 01:47:22,106
We're Union army!
We're lookin' for food!

1111
01:47:22,107 --> 01:47:24,690
Come on, open up! We're hungry!

1112
01:47:25,107 --> 01:47:27,609
- I got nothin'! I got nothin'!
- We'll see about that.

1113
01:47:30,151 --> 01:47:31,888
There's a baby inside. Get it.

1114
01:47:31,901 --> 01:47:33,649
Please, he's sick.
Don't hurt him, please.

1115
01:47:33,650 --> 01:47:35,611
Please, I got nothin'!

1116
01:47:38,653 --> 01:47:42,194
That's right. Take the chickens.
Take the chickens. They're all I got.

1117
01:47:46,153 --> 01:47:48,153
Says she's only got chickens.

1118
01:47:48,154 --> 01:47:51,696
You lyin' Southern trash.

1119
01:47:52,656 --> 01:47:54,656
We're hungry.

1120
01:47:54,657 --> 01:47:56,156
We got all day.

1121
01:47:57,155 --> 01:48:00,032
See, those birds
won't get you through the winter.

1122
01:48:00,157 --> 01:48:01,658
Please cover up my boy.

1123
01:48:01,659 --> 01:48:04,408
Just tell us where the food is,
we'll pick him up.

1124
01:48:04,824 --> 01:48:07,325
Please, my baby's sick.

1125
01:48:07,326 --> 01:48:09,408
Please, just cover him up.

1126
01:48:09,492 --> 01:48:12,993
Please, I'm beggin' you!

1127
01:48:12,994 --> 01:48:15,703
Please! Have mercy!

1128
01:48:17,994 --> 01:48:20,787
I got a hog!

1129
01:48:20,912 --> 01:48:22,329
I got a hog!

1130
01:48:22,411 --> 01:48:25,954
- He's hid out behind the house!
- Take a look.

1131
01:48:26,913 --> 01:48:29,747
Please!

1132
01:48:31,413 --> 01:48:34,082
Please, sir. Please.

1133
01:48:34,249 --> 01:48:36,249
He's just a baby!

1134
01:48:37,749 --> 01:48:40,208
He's shaking!

1135
01:48:40,250 --> 01:48:43,000
Please, just cover him up.

1136
01:48:43,251 --> 01:48:47,668
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with you?

1137
01:48:49,252 --> 01:48:52,250
I ain't got nothin' else, I swear.

1138
01:48:52,251 --> 01:48:55,170
- That ain't necessarily so.
- Yes.

1139
01:48:55,254 --> 01:48:58,003
Take me inside.
We'll do whatever you want.

1140
01:48:58,255 --> 01:49:02,754
Take my baby inside.
Let's all go inside! Please!

1141
01:49:02,755 --> 01:49:05,671
Please! Please!

1142
01:49:05,755 --> 01:49:08,923
You take that hog!
I'm as good as dead!

1143
01:49:09,257 --> 01:49:12,257
Take that hog 'cause I'm as good as dead!

1144
01:49:12,258 --> 01:49:14,507
Shut up!

1145
01:49:19,758 --> 01:49:22,136
No! Agh!

1146
01:49:28,219 --> 01:49:29,916
You know, he's gettin'
ready to take a fit.

1147
01:49:29,929 --> 01:49:31,637
What do you care?

1148
01:49:46,430 --> 01:49:48,974
Shh.. Shh..

1149
01:49:49,058 --> 01:49:51,517
That's better. Shh. That's better.

1150
01:49:55,057 --> 01:49:57,893
Hey, come on.
Leave some for the rest of us.

1151
01:50:08,563 --> 01:50:11,020
Move away from the baby!

1152
01:50:12,563 --> 01:50:14,689
Towards me!

1153
01:50:15,064 --> 01:50:18,522
Don't shoot.
We just wanted food.

1154
01:50:18,563 --> 01:50:20,897
Take off your boots.

1155
01:50:22,565 --> 01:50:25,941
Take off your pants.
Take off your shirt.

1156
01:50:33,068 --> 01:50:35,068
Don't shoot me, please.

1157
01:50:37,068 --> 01:50:40,067
We're starvin'.
We haven't eaten in days.

1158
01:50:40,068 --> 01:50:44,778
- Come on.
- We're starving. We haven't eaten in days.

1159
01:50:44,944 --> 01:50:46,988
Come on!

1160
01:50:49,821 --> 01:50:52,320
Thanks. Thank you.

1161
01:50:52,321 --> 01:50:54,614
- Now you get runnin'.
- I will.

1162
01:50:54,821 --> 01:50:57,114
- And keep runnin'.
- Thank you.

1163
01:51:57,752 --> 01:52:02,336
- I love the snow.
- I hate the snow, I hate the cold.

1164
01:52:04,254 --> 01:52:07,253
- Come on!
- Fellas, what's the rush?

1165
01:52:07,254 --> 01:52:11,839
If Ruby finds out we've spent the night,
there'll be hell to pay.

1166
01:52:48,514 --> 01:52:51,681
<i>"My love, where are you?"</i>

1167
01:52:52,140 --> 01:52:55,725
<i>"With no hope of reaching you,
I write to you,"</i>

1168
01:52:56,141 --> 01:52:58,100
<i>"as I always do,"</i>

1169
01:53:00,142 --> 01:53:02,477
<i>"as I have always done."</i>

1170
01:53:22,814 --> 01:53:25,939
You reckon we could eat this?

1171
01:53:26,815 --> 01:53:28,315
Hey.

1172
01:53:28,316 --> 01:53:31,984
Well, you know, you cook somethin'
long enough, you can eat anything.

1173
01:53:32,318 --> 01:53:35,317
It's froze.
How long it been there for?

1174
01:53:35,318 --> 01:53:38,234
- You hungry?
- Yeah.

1175
01:53:38,319 --> 01:53:40,402
Not very long.

1176
01:54:17,327 --> 01:54:19,245
Good evenin'.

1177
01:54:19,328 --> 01:54:21,826
Hope we didn't disturb you.

1178
01:54:21,827 --> 01:54:26,079
D'you mind if I warm myself by your fire?

1179
01:54:26,828 --> 01:54:28,579
Name's Teague.

1180
01:54:28,829 --> 01:54:31,330
- Do I know you?
- Stobrod Thewes.

1181
01:54:32,330 --> 01:54:34,581
- That your wife?
- That's a "he."

1182
01:54:34,830 --> 01:54:36,580
Is "he" your wife?

1183
01:54:36,831 --> 01:54:41,332
We're musicians.
He picks a banjo, I got a fiddle.

1184
01:54:41,333 --> 01:54:44,667
Your sweetheart's got
a nice piece of flesh on him.

1185
01:54:44,832 --> 01:54:48,293
- He looks pretty romantic by the fire.
- It's a picture of love.

1186
01:54:54,835 --> 01:54:57,169
You gonna play that fiddle?

1187
01:54:57,337 --> 01:54:58,753
Sure.

1188
01:54:58,836 --> 01:55:00,712
Sure.

1189
01:55:00,837 --> 01:55:02,838
Hey, wake up.

1190
01:55:04,337 --> 01:55:06,338
Evenin', missis.

1191
01:55:07,339 --> 01:55:09,837
- Where's Georgia?
- "Where's Georgia"?

1192
01:55:14,339 --> 01:55:17,841
- Captain Teague wants us to play now.
- Love to.

1193
01:55:17,842 --> 01:55:21,592
We heard there were some deserters
up in these parts hidden out in a big cave.

1194
01:55:21,842 --> 01:55:24,760
- Not come to my ears.
- So you don't know where this big cave is?

1195
01:55:24,843 --> 01:55:26,761
- No, sir.
- You do, Stobs. He means..

1196
01:55:26,843 --> 01:55:28,342
No, right. No, no.

1197
01:55:28,343 --> 01:55:32,095
There is a cave right up near Bearpen
Branch. We played some music up there.

1198
01:55:32,345 --> 01:55:36,844
- Never occurred to me they were outliers.
- It ain't nowhere near Bearpen Branch.

1199
01:55:36,845 --> 01:55:38,678
He's always gettin' lost.

1200
01:55:38,846 --> 01:55:41,762
That cave - we live there.

1201
01:55:41,847 --> 01:55:45,846
I used to freeze up in that cave
till I got gived this new coat.

1202
01:55:45,847 --> 01:55:49,890
Ruby made me this coat.
I like my coat.

1203
01:55:50,348 --> 01:55:53,725
This part belonged to a reverend
and this part belonged to a horse.

1204
01:55:53,848 --> 01:55:58,348
Ruby said - what is it? -
I should pray or neigh, dependin'.

1205
01:55:58,349 --> 01:56:00,601
He don't..
he don't know what he's sayin'.

1206
01:56:00,852 --> 01:56:04,685
He got a mind
no bigger than a pickled walnut.

1207
01:56:04,852 --> 01:56:07,811
It's a good coat.

1208
01:57:44,874 --> 01:57:46,751
Broke my young heart.

1209
01:57:51,375 --> 01:57:53,376
We gonna be here all night?

1210
01:57:55,878 --> 01:57:57,880
Stand over there.

1211
01:58:09,380 --> 01:58:12,880
Ruby, she don't know
one end of the war from the other.

1212
01:58:12,881 --> 01:58:15,881
You don't have to worry yourself about her,
is what I'm sayin'.

1213
01:58:15,882 --> 01:58:19,758
Or Ada, neither.
You know what I'm sayin'?

1214
01:58:19,884 --> 01:58:22,633
You too.
You stand over there.

1215
01:58:25,884 --> 01:58:28,301
We gonna get our tintype made?

1216
01:58:34,886 --> 01:58:36,385
Don't smile.

1217
01:58:36,386 --> 01:58:38,137
- What?
- Quit smilin'.

1218
01:58:38,385 --> 01:58:40,678
He always smiles.
He don't mean nothin' by it.

1219
01:58:40,888 --> 01:58:43,386
I told him, there ain't nothin'
in this world worth a smile!

1220
01:58:43,387 --> 01:58:45,929
Put your hat over your face.

1221
01:58:52,890 --> 01:58:54,932
Cover your face with your hat.

1222
01:59:03,309 --> 01:59:05,226
- Ruby!
- What?

1223
01:59:06,186 --> 01:59:07,810
- Ruby!
- What's wrong?

1224
01:59:07,977 --> 01:59:11,394
- Teague.. The Home Guard..
- What?

1225
01:59:12,436 --> 01:59:14,393
They shot your daddy!

1226
01:59:14,394 --> 01:59:16,479
They shot your daddy, and Pangle too!

1227
01:59:22,814 --> 01:59:26,812
I told Georgia he can stop here.
I told him he can sleep in the barn.

1228
01:59:26,813 --> 01:59:30,689
He's got nothin' inside him.
He'll walk out of here and die in the snow.

1229
01:59:30,814 --> 01:59:34,067
He can milk the cows.
I was worried about that.

1230
01:59:36,608 --> 01:59:40,567
It's five hours' climb from here.
He drew a map.

1231
01:59:40,692 --> 01:59:42,652
I'm ready.

1232
01:59:43,194 --> 01:59:46,027
You know them fools
stayed the night in the mill?

1233
01:59:47,694 --> 01:59:51,695
That's Stobrod Thewes. Can't do
one good thing without addin' the bad.

1234
01:59:51,696 --> 01:59:56,196
Left tracks in the snow all the way up
for the Home Guard to follow.

1235
01:59:56,197 --> 01:59:58,489
- Sign that says "Shoot me."
- Ruby..

1236
02:00:01,697 --> 02:00:03,198
Ruby.

1237
02:00:05,696 --> 02:00:07,866
I'm sorry.

1238
02:00:09,699 --> 02:00:12,616
Every piece of this is man's bullshit.

1239
02:00:12,700 --> 02:00:15,199
They call this war a cloud over the land,

1240
02:00:15,200 --> 02:00:17,584
but they made the weather,
and then they stand

1241
02:00:17,597 --> 02:00:19,992
in the rain and say
"Shit, it's rainin'!"

1242
02:00:25,704 --> 02:00:30,953
If I cry one tear for my daddy,
I stole it off a crocodile.

1243
02:00:34,705 --> 02:00:35,790
All right, then.

1244
02:01:25,259 --> 02:01:27,259
All right, then.

1245
02:01:28,259 --> 02:01:31,260
Dear God.

1246
02:01:35,761 --> 02:01:37,761
Oh, dear God.

1247
02:01:44,264 --> 02:01:46,722
He ain't here.

1248
02:01:46,762 --> 02:01:50,763
Agh! Teague's probably took him.

1249
02:01:50,764 --> 02:01:54,598
They did that with the Swanger boys,
didn't they?

1250
02:01:54,765 --> 02:01:57,724
Strung 'em up, as a warnin'.

1251
02:02:02,893 --> 02:02:05,184
They took his coat.

1252
02:02:05,393 --> 02:02:06,892
Why would they take his coat?

1253
02:02:13,104 --> 02:02:15,562
Daddy? Daddy!

1254
02:02:16,062 --> 02:02:18,060
Daddy!

1255
02:02:23,689 --> 02:02:25,398
Daddy?

1256
02:02:25,729 --> 02:02:28,147
He's still breathin'!

1257
02:02:28,148 --> 02:02:30,567
It's Ruby!

1258
02:02:30,649 --> 02:02:32,397
Don't you die on me again!

1259
02:02:38,942 --> 02:02:42,733
- We gotta get him home.
- He won't make it. He'll die first.

1260
02:02:42,734 --> 02:02:46,151
He's got hardly no blood left in him.

1261
02:02:48,944 --> 02:02:50,944
There it is. I feel it.

1262
02:02:50,945 --> 02:02:51,987
- You got it?
- Yep.

1263
02:02:53,069 --> 02:02:57,570
<i>There's a place close.
Old Cherokee, it used to be.</i>

1264
02:02:57,571 --> 02:02:59,822
<i>It's got shelter, water.</i>

1265
02:03:00,071 --> 02:03:02,738
<i>I used to hide up there
when he'd get a temper goin'.</i>

1266
02:03:02,739 --> 02:03:04,700
God!

1267
02:03:12,241 --> 02:03:16,242
- I'll go look for some food.
- Take the shotgun.

1268
02:03:41,831 --> 02:03:43,540
Goddamn.

1269
02:03:54,292 --> 02:03:56,292
Turn around!

1270
02:03:57,794 --> 02:04:00,336
Go back where you came from!

1271
02:04:02,295 --> 02:04:03,793
Go back!

1272
02:04:07,879 --> 02:04:09,920
Ada?

1273
02:04:10,754 --> 02:04:11,920
Ada Monroe?

1274
02:04:13,880 --> 02:04:16,672
Turn around or I'll shoot!

1275
02:04:45,263 --> 02:04:46,597
Inman?

1276
02:04:47,179 --> 02:04:49,180
Inman?

1277
02:05:02,017 --> 02:05:04,185
Inman.

1278
02:05:36,232 --> 02:05:38,317
You better come with me.

1279
02:05:50,943 --> 02:05:52,905
Ruby.

1280
02:05:53,944 --> 02:05:55,569
This is Inman.

1281
02:06:00,447 --> 02:06:02,905
Oh! Congratulations!

1282
02:06:02,946 --> 02:06:06,488
Oughta send you out with a shotgun
a lot more!

1283
02:06:08,615 --> 02:06:10,697
Looks if he's about to topple over.

1284
02:06:11,615 --> 02:06:14,200
- I may need to.
- You shot or somethin'?

1285
02:06:16,533 --> 02:06:18,118
Not lately.

1286
02:06:29,411 --> 02:06:32,497
- He's asleep.
- I ain't surprised.

1287
02:06:32,578 --> 02:06:36,996
- Your man looked tuckered out.
- I saw him.

1288
02:06:36,997 --> 02:06:41,121
In Sally Swanger's well.
A man like a black smudge in the snow.

1289
02:06:41,122 --> 02:06:44,582
- Well, there you go.
- It wasn't the same, what I saw.

1290
02:06:44,915 --> 02:06:47,082
In the well it was as if he were falling.

1291
02:06:47,165 --> 02:06:48,903
You probably just don't
remember it right.

1292
02:06:48,916 --> 02:06:50,665
I remember it exactly.

1293
02:06:50,666 --> 02:06:52,665
There were crows - black crows.

1294
02:06:52,666 --> 02:06:54,791
They were flyin' towards me.

1295
02:06:55,125 --> 02:06:58,418
Ruby, I thought I was seein' him fall.

1296
02:07:00,626 --> 02:07:03,711
Instead, I was seein' him come back to me.

1297
02:07:06,126 --> 02:07:09,587
I got big plans for that farm.

1298
02:07:13,629 --> 02:07:15,463
I know.

1299
02:07:16,632 --> 02:07:18,129
I know you have.

1300
02:07:18,130 --> 02:07:22,090
I got a vision in my mind
of how Black Cove oughta be.

1301
02:07:26,132 --> 02:07:28,550
I don't know, Ruby.

1302
02:07:28,634 --> 02:07:32,884
All this while
I've been packin' ice around my heart.

1303
02:07:35,634 --> 02:07:38,429
How do I make it melt?

1304
02:07:41,552 --> 02:07:43,013
Hey!

1305
02:07:43,551 --> 02:07:46,013
You about done with my knife?

1306
02:07:47,056 --> 02:07:49,305
We got a bird to cook.

1307
02:07:49,554 --> 02:07:51,389
Just about.

1308
02:07:54,056 --> 02:07:57,889
You're makin' a pig's ear of that job.

1309
02:07:59,557 --> 02:08:01,516
Give it to me.

1310
02:08:07,599 --> 02:08:10,224
Oh, I ain't gonna cut you.

1311
02:08:12,102 --> 02:08:16,353
Can't see that it'd make
a bit of difference if I did.

1312
02:08:26,814 --> 02:08:29,106
You got the right feelings for her?

1313
02:08:29,356 --> 02:08:32,272
Don't turn your head! Tsk.

1314
02:08:36,148 --> 02:08:37,564
I do.

1315
02:09:03,071 --> 02:09:06,155
I'm sorry.
I was tryin' to be quiet.

1316
02:09:12,074 --> 02:09:14,409
Did you get my letters?

1317
02:09:16,575 --> 02:09:18,575
I got three letters.

1318
02:09:19,576 --> 02:09:24,075
I carried them,
I carried them in the book you gave me.

1319
02:09:24,076 --> 02:09:25,743
The Bartram.

1320
02:09:26,579 --> 02:09:30,035
I probably sent 103.

1321
02:09:35,078 --> 02:09:37,579
Did you write to me?

1322
02:09:37,580 --> 02:09:39,371
Whenever I could.

1323
02:09:39,580 --> 02:09:41,872
If you never got them, I can summarize.

1324
02:09:42,081 --> 02:09:44,581
- No. No, no.
- "I pray you are well."

1325
02:09:44,582 --> 02:09:46,915
"I pray I am in your thoughts.

1326
02:09:47,081 --> 02:09:52,375
You are all that keeps me
from slidin' into some dark place."

1327
02:09:52,582 --> 02:09:55,582
How did I keep you?

1328
02:09:55,583 --> 02:09:58,460
We barely knew each other.
It was a few moments.

1329
02:09:58,585 --> 02:10:00,458
A thousand moments.

1330
02:10:03,586 --> 02:10:07,210
They're like a bag..
of tiny diamonds.

1331
02:10:08,587 --> 02:10:12,462
Don't matter if they're real
or things I made up.

1332
02:10:14,588 --> 02:10:16,672
The shape of your neck.

1333
02:10:18,589 --> 02:10:20,591
That's real.

1334
02:10:21,089 --> 02:10:25,050
The way you felt under my hands
when I pulled you to me.

1335
02:10:36,093 --> 02:10:38,719
You were plowing a field.

1336
02:10:40,093 --> 02:10:42,595
You were carrying a tray.

1337
02:10:42,596 --> 02:10:45,344
- You wouldn't come in.
- No, I wouldn't go in.

1338
02:10:45,596 --> 02:10:50,512
So that's why I had to carry a tray.
So I could come out to see you.

1339
02:10:52,597 --> 02:10:55,597
That kiss.

1340
02:10:55,598 --> 02:10:59,183
Which I kissed every day of my walking.

1341
02:11:01,098 --> 02:11:03,184
Every day I was waiting.

1342
02:11:03,600 --> 02:11:05,141
Longing.

1343
02:11:05,598 --> 02:11:08,683
Longing to see your face.

1344
02:11:14,602 --> 02:11:17,937
If you could see my inside..

1345
02:11:18,104 --> 02:11:23,060
Now, whatever you wanna name it -
my spirit? That's what I fear.

1346
02:11:24,103 --> 02:11:26,062
I think I'm ruined.

1347
02:11:26,104 --> 02:11:29,897
They kept tryin' to put me in the ground.

1348
02:11:31,106 --> 02:11:33,606
- But I wasn't ready.
- Inman..

1349
02:11:33,607 --> 02:11:37,025
But if I had.. if I had goodness,
I lost it.

1350
02:11:39,107 --> 02:11:42,317
If I had anything tender in me,
I shot it dead.

1351
02:11:44,108 --> 02:11:47,902
How could I write to you after what I done.

1352
02:11:49,110 --> 02:11:50,109
What I seen?

1353
02:11:50,110 --> 02:11:51,568
Number one,

1354
02:11:51,610 --> 02:11:53,944
shut this door.
It's freezin'.

1355
02:11:54,111 --> 02:11:57,112
Number two, shut that door.
It's freezin'.

1356
02:11:57,113 --> 02:11:59,527
Layin' on my back,
my fingers poked in my ears,

1357
02:11:59,611 --> 02:12:02,447
tryin' to shut out
who's got a bag of diamonds,

1358
02:12:02,612 --> 02:12:04,821
who's carrying a tray..

1359
02:12:05,113 --> 02:12:07,112
If you wanna get three
feet up a bull's ass,

1360
02:12:07,113 --> 02:12:10,699
just listen to what sweethearts
whisper to one another.

1361
02:12:11,115 --> 02:12:16,824
In fact, if y'all gonna wimble-wimble
all night, I'm gonna sleep in with him.

1362
02:12:31,619 --> 02:12:34,911
- I'll say good night.
- No.

1363
02:12:37,621 --> 02:12:39,622
Please..

1364
02:12:40,621 --> 02:12:42,413
don't say good night.

1365
02:13:07,128 --> 02:13:10,836
Wars make some things pointless.

1366
02:13:14,129 --> 02:13:17,463
It's hard to imagine a wedding.

1367
02:13:19,129 --> 02:13:22,422
I think even my father
would recognize that.

1368
02:13:22,632 --> 02:13:25,091
Ada, I wanna marry you.

1369
02:13:26,632 --> 02:13:28,174
If you'll have me.

1370
02:13:29,633 --> 02:13:34,592
Isn't there some religion where you just
have to say "I marry you" three times,

1371
02:13:34,633 --> 02:13:36,592
and you're man and wife?

1372
02:13:37,634 --> 02:13:39,593
I marry you.

1373
02:13:40,636 --> 02:13:42,762
I marry you, I marry you.

1374
02:13:48,138 --> 02:13:50,135
Why is that funny?

1375
02:13:50,136 --> 02:13:55,930
I think it's "I divorce you" three times
and you're not married anymore.

1376
02:13:56,638 --> 02:13:58,597
I can wait for you.

1377
02:13:58,639 --> 02:14:04,099
Oh, Inman.
I marry you, I marry you, I marry you.

1378
02:14:04,140 --> 02:14:06,099
I marry you, I marry you.

1379
02:14:14,142 --> 02:14:17,852
I have so..
I have so many buttons. Sorry.

1380
02:14:21,644 --> 02:14:24,437
Will you turn your back?

1381
02:14:35,648 --> 02:14:37,022
No.

1382
02:14:39,148 --> 02:14:40,608
No, I will not.

1383
02:16:26,382 --> 02:16:29,300
I'll lead the horse
at a pace your daddy can tolerate.

1384
02:16:29,674 --> 02:16:33,172
- You two go ahead now.
- No, I don't wanna do that.

1385
02:16:33,173 --> 02:16:35,884
- No. We can all go together.
- It's safer this way.

1386
02:16:36,259 --> 02:16:38,675
We're deserters.
No one has a quarrel with you.

1387
02:16:38,676 --> 02:16:40,633
He's right.

1388
02:16:40,634 --> 02:16:44,844
I gather I..
I need permission from you, Ruby.

1389
02:16:45,178 --> 02:16:48,305
If I reckon on livin' at Black Cove.

1390
02:16:57,679 --> 02:16:59,097
All right, then.

1391
02:17:02,682 --> 02:17:04,891
You stay on that horse.

1392
02:17:05,182 --> 02:17:08,141
And don't lose it.
Or sell it.

1393
02:17:09,183 --> 02:17:12,100
Gonna need it back on the farm.

1394
02:17:14,686 --> 02:17:16,684
All right, Daddy.

1395
02:17:20,895 --> 02:17:22,644
I don't wanna let you go.

1396
02:17:26,393 --> 02:17:29,605
I'll be with you by nightfall.

1397
02:17:34,564 --> 02:17:36,022
Ugh.

1398
02:17:37,732 --> 02:17:40,107
All right, then.

1399
02:18:10,780 --> 02:18:14,615
Hope that Georgia boy's
been tendin' to the animals.

1400
02:18:14,781 --> 02:18:17,740
- I knew you were thinkin' on him.
- I was not!

1401
02:18:17,783 --> 02:18:19,782
- I was thinkin' on swollen udders.
- Oh..!

1402
02:18:19,783 --> 02:18:24,034
- And before you say "same difference"..
- I'm sayin' nothin'!

1403
02:18:24,284 --> 02:18:28,783
Miss Lovey-Dovey!
Miss Lovey-Dovey!

1404
02:18:28,784 --> 02:18:30,827
Hey!

1405
02:18:31,160 --> 02:18:35,328
- That was a long funeral for your daddy.
- That was a wake.

1406
02:18:35,369 --> 02:18:36,952
That was Irish.

1407
02:18:39,037 --> 02:18:41,037
Now, your friend Georgia here..

1408
02:18:41,038 --> 02:18:44,745
We went down to visit you when
we heard you were harborin' deserters,

1409
02:18:44,746 --> 02:18:48,872
and he told us - after some persuasion -
you were up here.

1410
02:18:48,956 --> 02:18:51,831
We were up and down
this mountain.

1411
02:18:51,956 --> 02:18:53,289
Up and down.

1412
02:18:53,791 --> 02:18:55,625
There will be a reckoning.

1413
02:18:55,707 --> 02:18:58,667
When this war is over,
there will be a reckoning.

1414
02:19:00,250 --> 02:19:02,332
Did you make this coat?

1415
02:19:02,333 --> 02:19:04,335
Helpin' a deserter - that's treason.

1416
02:19:04,709 --> 02:19:09,212
Now, I know
it's half horse and half reverend.

1417
02:19:10,836 --> 02:19:12,794
A reckonin'?

1418
02:19:14,419 --> 02:19:17,545
The reckoning's for your world.

1419
02:19:17,670 --> 02:19:20,339
It's not mine.

1420
02:19:24,547 --> 02:19:27,421
I'll be damned.
He's a hard bastard to kill.

1421
02:19:31,390 --> 02:19:33,687
- No!
- Ruby!

1422
02:19:39,112 --> 02:19:40,655
Inman!

1423
02:19:54,426 --> 02:19:56,262
Captain Teague!

1424
02:20:38,243 --> 02:20:42,292
- Come down from there!
- No, sir. Here is fine.

1425
02:20:42,459 --> 02:20:45,465
I'll just shoot the horse
out from under you.

1426
02:20:45,590 --> 02:20:48,550
- You ridin' Captain Teague's animal?
- I am.

1427
02:20:48,551 --> 02:20:51,722
- He dead?
- I hope so.

1428
02:20:51,974 --> 02:20:56,355
Look, give me your gun and ride on home.
I'm done fightin', I'm sick of it!

1429
02:20:56,356 --> 02:20:58,858
I give you my gun,
you're gonna shoot me dead.

1430
02:20:58,859 --> 02:21:00,027
I will not shoot you,

1431
02:21:00,362 --> 02:21:03,865
but nor am I goin' down this mountain
lookin' over my shoulder for you.

1432
02:21:03,866 --> 02:21:06,078
That's what they call a conundrum.

1433
02:21:10,252 --> 02:21:14,341
- I'll tell you what I got on my side.
- What you got on your side?

1434
02:21:21,228 --> 02:21:23,064
The confidence of youth.

1435
02:21:38,629 --> 02:21:40,799
Inman!

1436
02:22:32,294 --> 02:22:34,257
No!

1437
02:23:10,020 --> 02:23:11,230
I..

1438
02:23:12,023 --> 02:23:14,444
came.. back.

1439
02:23:23,542 --> 02:23:25,920
I love you.

1440
02:23:58,888 --> 02:24:00,891
Baby.

1441
02:24:26,972 --> 02:24:30,436
<i>What we have lost
will never be returned to us.</i>

1442
02:24:31,980 --> 02:24:34,319
<i>The land will not heal.</i>

1443
02:24:34,984 --> 02:24:38,031
<i>Too much blood.</i>

1444
02:24:38,490 --> 02:24:41,995
<i>The heart will not heal.</i>

1445
02:24:41,996 --> 02:24:45,792
<i>All we can do is make peace with the past</i>

1446
02:24:46,001 --> 02:24:48,046
<i>and try to learn from it.</i>

1447
02:24:51,010 --> 02:24:55,558
- What are you doing?
- He died in the night, love.

1448
02:24:57,225 --> 02:24:59,062
Bring him here.

1449
02:24:59,063 --> 02:25:02,193
- Don't kill him.
- I'm not gonna kill him.

1450
02:25:02,526 --> 02:25:06,531
We have to try somethin'
or else he's gonna die too.

1451
02:25:06,532 --> 02:25:09,413
It's all right.

1452
02:25:09,996 --> 02:25:12,499
We're gonna try a little trick.

1453
02:25:12,500 --> 02:25:14,963
Shh.

1454
02:25:34,618 --> 02:25:39,793
<i>There are days now
when I manage not to think of you.</i>

1455
02:25:40,628 --> 02:25:45,635
<i>When the needs of the farm
call with more urgency than my heart.</i>

1456
02:25:46,970 --> 02:25:50,976
<i>This time of year
there's so much life everywhere.</i>

1457
02:25:52,981 --> 02:25:54,941
<i>I find you in all of it.</i>

1458
02:25:56,987 --> 02:25:59,990
<i>As if you were still walking home to me.</i>

1459
02:26:02,996 --> 02:26:07,084
<i>If you could see us now
this Easter day at Black Cove,</i>

1460
02:26:07,085 --> 02:26:10,591
<i>you would know
every step of your journey was worth it.</i>

1461
02:26:28,035 --> 02:26:31,498
Grace Inman, nobody said "Eat."

1462
02:26:44,100 --> 02:26:48,816
For good friends, good food, good family,

1463
02:26:49,109 --> 02:26:52,111
all our blessings, O Lord, we thank thee.

1464
02:26:52,112 --> 02:26:53,490
- Amen.
- Amen.

1465
02:26:53,740 --> 02:26:55,368
- Amen.
- Amen.

1466
02:26:55,493 --> 02:26:58,039
Amen!

1467
02:26:58,122 --> 02:27:01,835
- Sweetheart, there's no cider.
- That's for you.

1468
02:27:01,960 --> 02:27:06,176
Right, I'd best..
I'd best fetch it, I got my orders.

1469
02:27:09,347 --> 02:27:13,272
<i>I looked once more down Sally's well,</i>

1470
02:27:13,354 --> 02:27:17,444
<i>and this time
there was nothin' there to haunt me.</i>

1471
02:27:18,360 --> 02:27:20,323
<i>Just clouds.</i>

1472
02:27:20,364 --> 02:27:24,663
<i>Clouds, and then.. sun.</i>

1473
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:36,000
