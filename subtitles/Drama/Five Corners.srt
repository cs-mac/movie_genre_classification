00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:19,560
♫ There are places I remember ♫

2
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:24,189
♫ All my life Though some have changed ♫

3
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:28,777
♫ Some forever Not for better ♫

4
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:33,574
♫ Some have gone And some remain ♫

5
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:38,537
♫ All these places Had their moments ♫

6
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:43,042
♫ With lovers and friends I still can recall ♫

7
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:47,629
♫ Some are dead And some are living ♫

8
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:52,217
♫ In my life I've loved them all ♫

00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,011
♫ ♫

10

♫ But of all These friends and lovers ♫

11
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:06,231
♫ There is no one Compares with you ♫

12
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:11,111
♫ And these memories Lose their meaning ♫

13
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:15,783
♫ When I think of love As something new ♫

14
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:20,746
♫ Though I know I'll never lose affection ♫

15
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:25,501
♫ For people and things That went before ♫

16
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:30,339
♫ I know I'll often stop And think about them ♫

17
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:35,094
♫ In my life I love you more ♫

♫ ♫♫

19
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:47,940
...will transform the salient
misdeeds of bloodthirsty mobs

20
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:51,693
into the calculated good deeds of orderly citizens.

21
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:54,947
I know there are temptations

22
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:56,865
to turn to physical violence.

23
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,828
I know the temptations that we all face.

24
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:04,123
But let me urge you as we go on in the days ahead

25
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:06,959
to recognize that we have a power

26
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:09,795
greater than guns, greater than ammunition

27
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:13,298
greater than hand grenades, we have a power.

28
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:14,193
Hello, Heinz. Long time no see.

29
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:22,534
Ha. I was in prison.

30
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:23,869
We know.

31
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:25,704
And now you're out.

32
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:28,373
Yeah.

33
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:33,253
Just out.

34
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,714
How much for the pie?

35
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,341
One dollar.

36
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,229
How much is it now?

37
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:53,815
Now?

38
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,359
Now it's nothing.

39
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:20,819
Drop me.

40
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:31,330
Wow. Am I not wonderful?

41
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,669
What is youse doin' now?

42
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,921
Glue.

43
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,507
You've just done pills.

44
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:47,095
Those downs were garbage.

45
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:51,016
Melanie, Melanie, why don't
you sit up here with me, huh?

46
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:55,562
Hey, now, don't mess up my thoughts, Sal. This is hard.

47
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,817
Okay, that's it.

48
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:16,750
I'm flyin', man. I'm flyin' from my friggin' feet!

49
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,468
What a pair of freakin' debutantes.

50
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:31,556
Melanie, you know. Come here, honey. Come here.

51
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:36,603
You got glue all over your friggin' beak.

52
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:39,314
All right, you wanna fly? You wanna fly?

53
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,149
I can fly too, all right?

54
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,609
Let's fly.

55
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,739
I'm flyin', man.

56
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,494
It is not as it should be.

57
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,287
It's beautiful.

58
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,832
There's too much space between the letters.

59
00:06:56,916 --> 00:07:02,087
My eyes cannot see it together as one word.

60
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,005
So, I took two of 'em.

61
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,341
It was like 11 o'clock and nothin' happened.

62
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,510
Hey, you wanna couple of broads?

63
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,679
Que pasa, my friend?

64
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,431
I wanna know if you wanna take

65
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,182
a couple a broads off my hands?

66
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,434
What's wrong with 'em?

67
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,102
Look at 'em. They're ripped outta their gourds.

68
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,271
I'm sick a lookin' at 'em in my rear view mirror.

69
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:20,856
I want them out of the car. Capisce?

70
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,357
You want them or not?

71
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,444
... I can't feel my arms...

72
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:26,945
What is he saying?

73
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,030
He wants us to take these girls.

74
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:32,200
Really? That's marvelous. Isn't it?

75
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,286
Five dollars.

76
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:35,954
Five bucks what?

77
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,873
Five dollars and we'll take the girls.

78
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,624
Look, I'm telling yah, these downs

79
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:42,335
these downs were the most serious kind of-

80
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,046
Okay. Here.

81
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,381
... kind of garbage I ever had.

82
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:50,177
They're all yours. Go. Bye.

83
00:07:58,603 --> 00:07:59,728
Who are you?

84
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,396
Castro.

85
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,815
Where's your beard?

86
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:08,987
You live around here?

87
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:10,822
Yeah, I live around here.

88
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,574
I live all around here.

89
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,093
Where are they now?

90
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,012
Murray, wait a minute, wait a minute.

91
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:35,764
Where is it? What happened?

92
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,182
Oh, no.

93
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:37,849
Our sign.

94
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:40,352
I know, come on. Let's just take the stuff in.

95
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:42,604
It's you who wanted the sign.

96
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:43,688
Save the sign.

97
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,273
You wanted to spend money on a sign.

98
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,442
It's all right, don't worry
about it. Don't worry about it.

99
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,235

Look-look-

100
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,529
I know, I know. It's just a pumpkin. They had some fun!

101
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,373
What are you staring at?

102
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:02,999
So, forgive me, I just caught a flash of

103
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,459
why you kissed me off.

104
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,211
Yeah, who asked ya?

105
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,588
What'd you think? You think I don't think?

106
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,757
I know what's going on here. I
know exactly what's going on here.

107
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:12,592
You don't know nothin'.

108
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:13,385
That's the one I want.

109
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:14,052
No, it ain't.

110
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:16,471
Heinz is back. I just saw him.

111
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,847
Oh, he is?

112
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,057
You're trying to protect me?

113
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,350
No, I ain't.

114
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:22,102
When it's me who should be protecting you.

115
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:24,104
Yeah, like the last time?

116
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:33,113
This fish is a female fish.

117
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:35,824
So I don't want this one. I want that one.

118
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,993
Take the freakin' fish and get off my back, okay?

119
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,828
Go pay my father at the register.

120
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,496
All right.

121
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,123
Dad, I'm gonna take some lunch.

122
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,666
You hold down the fort, okay?

123
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,750
Okay then.

124
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:47,669
James.

125
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,504
James! Look-

126
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,339
you're gonna have to excuse me.

127
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,091
I know I ain't going about this the ideal way-

128
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:54,718
but, like, Heinz tried to rape me

129
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:58,847
you tried to stop him and now you limp.

130
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,308
So what?

131
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:03,768
So Heinz is back and I gotta get some protection.

132
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:04,769
I'll protect you.

133
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,354
You can't.

134
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,231
What, are you gonna go to the police?

135
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,357
They ain't gonna help you. He ain't done nothin'.

136
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,484
No, I ain't gonna go to the
cops. I'm gonna go to Harry.

137
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,445
Harry?

138
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,488
Yeah. That's who stopped him the last time.

139
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:16,990
But don't you know what Harry's
been doing? That was then.

140
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,783
He ain't gonna help you with this.

141
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,660
We'll see about that.

142
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:21,995
Ain't you heard?

143
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,331
Harry's nonviolent now!

144
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,127
...who will support the fight
for democracy around the world.

145
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,962
Vote for the man who believes extremism

146
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,131
in the pursuit of liberty is no vice.

147
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:37,344
Moderation in the pursuit of freedom is no virtue.

148
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:42,849
♫ Don't stand in the doorway,
Don't block up the hall ♫

00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,952
Yeah, Ma?

156
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:06,581

00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,260
He won't cooperate with me.

00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,221
I don't really haven't that much time, Ma-Mother.

161
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:23,598
I'm supposed to be meeting the guy-the gentleman

162
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,726
from SNCC in Harlem this afternoon.

163
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:29,604
Excuse me, Harry, who belongs to this dog?

164
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:30,480
It's my dog.

165
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:34,567
That's right. The Buddha belongs to you.

166
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,903
I cannot walk the Buddha.

167
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:38,822
I cannot do anything with the Buddha

168
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,699
that the Buddha does not want me to do.

169
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,784
Okay, I'll walk him.

170
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,077
Come here, Buddha boy.

171
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:32,083
Hey, Brita.

172
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,251
Brita!

173
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:37,839
Brita.

174
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,758
Oh, I got a headache.

175
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,261
Where are we?

176
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:47,474
I don't know. This ain't my house.

177
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:53,271
This ain't my house either.

178
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,940
Well, whose house is this?

179
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:57,817
What did we do last night?

180
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,444
You were with Sal.

181
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,696
This ain't Sal's house.

182
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:05,950
Wait a minute.

183
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,161
There were some guys.

184
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:10,330
Yeah?

185
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:12,165
Yeah.

186
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:17,962
I ain't wearing no clothes.

187
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,470
I ain't wearing no clothes neither.

188
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:31,976
M rs. Fitzgerald.

189
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,728
Yeah?

190
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:37,398
Hi. Uh, I'm Linda Komkowski. Is Harry in?

191
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:40,151
No, I'm sorry, he's not.

192
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,403
He'll be right back.

193
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,822
Do you want to come in and wait for him?

194
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:45,198
Sure, yeah.

195
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:46,783
Come on.

196
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,792
Hello, Heinz.

197
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,961
Fuck you.

198
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,297
So they let you out.

199
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:46,092
I don't let no hair grow over to
hide this scar you gave me, Harry.

200
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,052
You should. You look like shit.

201
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:50,471
I don't wanna forget!

202
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,600
What? That some goon hit you
over the head with a beer pitcher?

203
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:55,810
It don't seem like no golden memory to me.

204
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,896
Why don't you forget it?

205
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,773
I'm trying to forget it. I'm not proud of it.

206
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:03,818
I had a lot of time to think
when I was in that fucking hole.

207
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:08,072
Yeah, well, it's a shame you didn't use it.

208
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:11,826
Yeah, well-

209
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,331
why don't you go walk your dog?

210
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:20,084
Leave me to smoke my cigarette.

211
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:24,672
Look, Heinz, I-

212
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,674
I wanna say something to you.

213
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,597
I love you.

214
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:38,269
I did a lotta soul searching while you were gone

215
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:41,147
I've had a lot of bad shit happen.

216
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:44,609
And I don't wanna do that caveman stuff no more.

217
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,110
I wanna help people.

218
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,536
You love me?

219
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:56,621
Yeah.

220
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,979
It's funny how things are, you know.

221
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:23,272
How things are set up.

222
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,358
You're the first girl ever
to come here asking for Harry

223
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:28,736
and he's out walking the dog.

224
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,530
You know him from Fordham?

225
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:33,157
No, no, from the neighborhood.

226
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:36,703
It's funny. I figured he'd go to school

227
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:40,748
meet some girl and get married.

228
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,834
And here he graduated in june

229
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:45,086
and he's still as single as he ever was. Right?

230
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,380
Right.

231
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:49,007
Well, I guess so. It's...

232
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:55,179
He got so serious after his father died.

233
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:58,057
His father was a hero cop.

234
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,685
You get to be a hero cop by being killed.

235
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:03,604
Yeah. I know about that.

236
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,231
Why don't you sit down?

237
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:16,117
You with the student nonviolent Negro thing?

238
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,952
No.

239
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:22,457
Harry's got it in his head to be a hero, too.

240
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,960
Harry's gonna go down to M ississippi

241
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:30,048
him and a buncha other heroes.

242
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:36,971
Register Negroes for the vote.

243
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,432
Those hillbilly cops down there

244
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:41,642
with their third-grade educations and their shotguns

245
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,936
and their love of the Negro people-

246
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:46,814
they're gonna welcome Harry the hero, my son

247
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:50,068
make him feel at home.

248
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,611
Maybe I should go.

249
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:54,739
I'm sorry.

250
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:58,910
He's packing his bag. It was just on my mind.

251
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,661
Why do you wanna see Harry?

252
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:06,709
Who's that?

253
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:11,798
Can I help you-

254
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,716
Excuse me. Excuse me, Mrs. Fitzgerald

255
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,510
but Linda's here, right?

256
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,261
james, what are you doing here?

257
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:20,306
I just figured it out. You got a thing for this guy.

258
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,433
This number about protection, that's just smoke.

259
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,268
You're throwing me over so's you can make a play

260
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,353
for Harry Fitzgerald.

261
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,646
Uh, your son.

262
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,189
Excuse me, M rs. Fitzgerald

263
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:28,981
but I'm in love with this girl.

264
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,316
She's pulling a number on me.

265
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,943
I figured it out, Linda. Tell me I'm wrong.

266
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:32,944
You're wrong.

267
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:35,113
Bull-hockey.

268
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:36,405
Maybe you don't understand what's going on.

269
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,490
Shall I explain it to you?

270
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:38,783
I wish you would.

271
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,284
This one here is my girl.

272
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:41,869
Last night she breaks up with me.

273
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,704
I feel bad. You could understand that.

274
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,248
Sure.

275
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:46,332
And she don't tell me why.

276
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:50,128
So today I'm eatin' my heart out
- when I see Heinz.

277
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,879
Heinz?

278
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,631
Hei
- uh, bad boy from way back. He busted my hip.

279
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,466
He tried to rape Linda, et cetera, et cetera.

280
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:57,135
Harry saved the situation.

281
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,679
Iced Heinz completely with a pitcher of beer.

282
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:02,014
So, now she tells me she's breaking up with me

283
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,724
on account of Heinz being back.

284
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,184
You said that.

285
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:06,936
Ah, you didn't contradict me.

286
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,896
And that she's going to Harry for protection.

287
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,690
Now the whole world knows that Harry's

288
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:12,316
out to lunch with this Gandhi thing.

289
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,860
Would you like some coffee?

290
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,528
No, I think a cup of coffee right now

291
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:17,446
would give me a heart attack. Thank you.

292
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:19,115
So when I got a minute to think about it

293
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:21,868
I'm thinking it definitely don't add up.

294
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:24,203
And then, bam, I understand!

295
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:28,541
It must be like she got obsessed for Harry Fitzgerald

296
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:32,712
and that she's using Heinz for smoke to blow on me.

297
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:34,922
Oh, james, please.

298
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,507
But what else could it be?

299
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:37,216
Would you like to sit down?

300
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,886
I can't sit down M rs.
Fitzgerald. I'm a man on the move.

301
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:44,265
Sit down!

302
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,438
What's this?

303
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:54,650
This? This is your life, clown.

304
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:08,539
Bud, hey, come and see me inside in 20 minutes.

305
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,216
Good morning, Maxine.

306
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,717
Good morning.

307
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,135
Busy day, huh?

308
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,641
Why don't you wait a little
while, will ya? They'll turn up.

309
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,018
But neither of their own mothers ain't heard from them.

310
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:31,812
Well, why ain't their own mothers down
here complaining about it then, huh?

311
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,398
Because they got a shitty attitude. Like you.

312
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,609
Oh, yeah? Well why don't you take a lesson from them

313
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:38,236
and just don't worry about it.

314
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,862
How's it going, Phil?

315
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,489
Good, Sully. What'd it look like?

316
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:44,242
Homicide.

317
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,244
Look, you gotta help me find these chicks, all right?

318
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:47,870
I feel responsible for them.

319
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,830
Well, go! Go and find 'em. Go with God.

320
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,791
Just leave me alone, will ya, for cryin' out loud?

321
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,334
Thirty-third Precinct.

322
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:02,843
So, it was really an arrow?

323
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,179
Yeah. Right in the back.

324
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,014
What do you make of that?

325
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,767
I ndians. What happened there? Somebody tag you?

326
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,270
No, it's a pimple.

327
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,855
You know there used to be Indians around here.

328
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,024
Is that right?

329
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:22,113
Sure. This whole area here was I
ndians. It was called Keskeekek.

330
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:23,281
Is that right?

331
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,532
Sure.

332
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:25,616
Well, what happened?

333
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,326
What do you mean?

334
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:29,704
Why ain't they here now?

335
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,998
The neighborhood changed.

336
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:44,844
So who killed this-what was he?

337
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:50,641
Algebra teacher. I don't know.

338
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:53,561
Heinz Sabatino's back on the street, you know.

339
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:56,230
Yeah, I know.

340
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,357
Think it might be him?

341
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:02,903
Maybe, but where did he learn
the art of the bow and arrow?

342
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:07,033
He could've picked it up in the pen.

343
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:08,784
Who from?

344
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:13,998
An I ndian. A camp counselor. I don't know.

345
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:19,378
So, uh, we moved in and the I ndians moved out.

346
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,422
That's right, the I ndians moved out

347
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:24,842
and a Dutch couple moved in.

348
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:26,385
Who were they?

349
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,387
They were the Bronx.

350
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:31,057
Something like John and Katrina Bronc.

351
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:36,103
People used to say, "Let's go over
and visit the Broncs tonight. "

352
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,856
Boy, this is weird.

353
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:45,112
This is, like, the weirdest
thing that's ever happened to me.

354
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,031
It's them.

355
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:48,783
Who? The guys from last night?

356
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:51,952
Hi, Brita. You get some good sleep?

357
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:57,041
He knows my name. And he's French or something.

358
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,959
German.

359
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,128
German, huh?

360
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,755
Is that your apartment?

361
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,882
No, not exactly.

362
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:07,093
This is an apartment over which we have use.

363
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:10,096
Until the superintendent finds out!

364
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,056
Listen, somebody murdered our teacher

365
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,391
so we got the day off.

366
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:18,104
You wanna go for a ride?

367
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:23,567
A ride?

368
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:24,735
All right.

369
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,887
Tweet, tweet, tweet. Tweet.

370
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,681
Tweet, tweet.

371
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:09,447
Someone there?

372
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:12,450
Is someone there?

373
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:13,868
It's me.

374
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:16,412
Heinz? Is that you?

375
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,500
Yeah.

376
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,502
I can't believe it's you!

377
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,907
God, I hate that.

378
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:55,034
I do play it a little loud

379
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:57,244
but it's so beautiful. It makes me feel so good.

380
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:03,167
I got your letters all the time you was gone.

381
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:04,919
I didn't write.

382
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,462
Oh, I know you did.

383
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:07,963
Maybe I didn't get 'em all the time

384
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:09,757
but I know you wrote your mother.

385
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:10,883
How's the asthma?

386
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:16,931
I ain't had asthma since I was twelve.

387
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,766
Yeah, you've been gone a long time.

388
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:21,769
Ooh, what a weird haircut.

389
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:25,814
I'm sure it's the style now.

390
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:29,777
This what I have they call
Corinthian Curls. Ya like it?

391
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,698
I wanna change my clothes.

392
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,200
My clothes still here?

393
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:37,243
Yeah.

394
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:47,586
I want
- I wanna change my clothes.

395
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,296
Where's the bathroom?

396
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,589
Okey doke.

397
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,954
Look, you don't even know he's gonna bother you.

398
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:23,914
When I talked to him today, it was like-

399
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:26,166
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You talked to Heinz?

400
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:29,336
Yeah. And I told him I loved him.

401
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:33,257
You told Heinz Sabatino you loved him?

402
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:36,594
Yeah, I did.

403
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:39,305
This is who you're going to for protection?

404
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:41,265
I'm sorry, Linda.

405
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:42,808
I gotta have a chuckle over this one.

406
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:44,852
This guy's further out than Sputnik.

407
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:47,813
Look, when you want my help, you know where to find me.

408
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:50,858
Harry, all the best in Mississippi.

409
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:54,653
It ain't worth it being jealous with you.

410
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:57,197
You're a wacko and you're leaving town.

411
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:58,991
It ain't worth it.

412
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:03,829
This is not a rival. This is a phenomenon.

413
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:10,002
You gotta excuse him.

414
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:12,129
He's just... he's just kinda nervous

415
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:13,505
about himself, you know?

416
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,883
It's okay.

417
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:18,218
You saved him too, right?

418
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:23,390
I guess that makes him feel kinda weird.

419
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:27,728
He limps around and I, I guess he don't feel like a

420
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:30,564
you know, like enough of a man or something.

421
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,833
Hi, Ed.

422
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:51,502
What do you say?

423
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:54,088
Good afternoon, Esther.

424
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:57,549
Hi, Jimmy.

425
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:58,676
Quiet all day?

426
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:00,761
So far.

427
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:02,012
Ha, how's he doing?

428
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,806
One more, it's a knock.

429
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,522
What you drinking, Esther?

430
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:13,524
Nothing.

431
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:15,359
What was in that glass?

432
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:19,363
Hmmm... let's see.

433
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:24,118
No-that one.

434
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:27,246
Uh, excuse me, Jimmy. I'm lookin' for Melanie.

435
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:30,374
Maybe you seen her?

436
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:32,876
No.

437
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:34,294
Nothing?

438
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,588
Look, I just got on.

439
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:38,340
All right. Thanks.

440
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:45,556
I understand, you got things you gotta do.

441
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:48,267
I'm just scared is all.

442
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:51,645
I guess that's my problem, though, right?

443
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,564
You probably won't even hear from the guy.

444
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:55,566
All that junk was a long time ago.

445
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:58,986
But what if I do hear from him?

446
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,655
All right, if you hear from him, call me.

447
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,449
Thanks.

448
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:05,951
Listen, uh, I'm probably only gonna be around

449
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:07,578
a couple more days

450
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:10,330
and then you're strictly on your own.

451
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,499
He probably won't bother you.

452
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,463
All right, take it easy.

453
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:25,179
She left the bag open for like two hours.

454
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,597
The glue was like a frigging' rock.

455
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:27,514
What a shame.

456
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:28,766
Okay.

457
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,434
Okay what?

458
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:31,477
Whatnot Willie?

459
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:32,936
Whatnot.

460
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:34,605
This is a whatnot.

461
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:36,190
What's it for?

462
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:38,150
Watch. We're on the tenth floor, right?

463
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:39,777
Right.

464
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:42,654
So I push nine and
- can you hold this?

465
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:43,989
This?

466
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:45,949
Yeah. And-

467
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,039
I put this here.

468
00:29:58,671 --> 00:30:01,131
Come on. This is the ride I promised you.

469
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,674
This one is for us.

470
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:04,802
Oh there?

471
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:06,136
Come on. It's a goof.

472
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:14,061
After you.

473
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,152
Come on. Don't be afraid.

474
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,159
Sit down.

475
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,673
So, what do we do now?

476
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:44,341
Now we wait.

477
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:52,099
Oh. They're gone.

478
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:54,434
They'll be back.

479
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:01,733
Melanie, dig this. It's like outer space!

480
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:04,486
Yeah, it's like that down here too.

481
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:55,495
Hi!

482
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:58,749
Bye!

483
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:54,388
What you want, dear?

484
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:56,181
He don't want nothin', Nancy.

485
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:58,141
He's just crazy, right?

486
00:32:58,184 --> 00:33:00,227
I'm meeting a couple friends.

487
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:05,190
Shoot. Ain't nobody got no friends in here, Sonny.

488
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:07,651
Hey, gimme a dollar-

489
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:11,363
I may be able to get you outta here alive.

490
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:14,658
Hello, Arthur.

491
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:16,159
Hello, Brother Harold.

492
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:18,245
Sit down.

493
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:21,081
We haven't met, have we, uh
-?

494
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:23,834
You're not sure?

495
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:27,671
Um, I'm Harry Fitzgerald.

496
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:30,257
This is Brother Samuel Kemp.

497
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:33,844
He's been down in Mississippi
for us for a long time now.

498
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:36,930
He's been working with Brother Stokely Carmichael.

499
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:39,182
Can I get you something?

500
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:47,107
Yeah, I'll have coffee, too. Black.

501
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:51,278
The purpose of the M ississippi Project is to, uh

502
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:53,697
get rich white kids working down there

503
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:56,616
beside those of us Negroes who've been beaten up enough

504
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:59,411
to satisfy a lifetime in the cause of The Movement

505
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:02,581
without the population up North getting upset about it.

506
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:05,959
Now, we figure if we can get these rich white kids

507
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:09,087
to get beat up in the cause of The Movement

508
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:11,965
that'll get the TV cameras rolling real good.

509
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:17,262
Here you go.

510
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:19,056
Thank you.

511
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:23,393
I, uh, I want you to like me, M r. Kemp.

512
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,901
I don't like you.

513
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:35,655
I don't like the idea of you.

514
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:40,327
What I mean is I want you to,
uh, approve me for this project.

515
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,954
I want to be on that bus-

516
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:45,082
the day after tomorrow.

517
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:48,251
Why should I approve you?

518
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:52,339
Why should Brother Arthur here approve you?

519
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,466
Look at you.

520
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:57,427
You look to me like you're made out of sweet butter

521
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:00,347
and when that Mississippi sun lands on you

522
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:03,016
you're gonna melt down to nothing but grease.

523
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:07,270
They got State Troopers down there waiting for you, uh

524
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:11,024
Harvard types with a knife and fork.

525
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:15,362
Now, why don't you go home?

526
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:21,034
I can understand if you don't like me, M r. Kemp.

527
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,871
I can. I, uh

528
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:28,708
I might not like you.

529
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:32,045
I don't know. Yet.

530
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:35,966
But lemme set you straight on a couple things.

531
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,635
I'm not rich.

532
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:40,512
I didn't go to Harvard.

533
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:43,306
I went to Fordham, which ain't Harvard.

534
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:47,894
And I come from a place in
the Bronx called Five Corners.

535
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:52,357
Now, The Movement has, has not been to this place.

536
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:56,153
If a Negro, if you, for instance

537
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:59,531
were to walk through Five Corners

538
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:01,158
before you'd gone one block

539
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:02,701
people would come outta their houses

540
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:05,537
and stomp your ass into the ground.

541
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:08,832
Now, two years ago, I woulda been one of those people

542
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:11,084
but something happened-

543
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:15,422
And.. I.. I had a change of heart.

544
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:19,092
You see, my, uh-

545
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,722
my father was killed, my father was shot.

546
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:27,726
He was, he was a cop and he was shot by some kid

547
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:31,897
some crazy kid, and, uh

548
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:34,524
when I was sitting home with my mother

549
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:38,445
watching the news about it on TV

550
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,530
the next thing they showed after that

551
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,782
was Dr. Martin Luther King speaking.

552
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:48,622
And he was talking about the power of love

553
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:52,626
in the face of senseless cruelty and violence.

554
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,045
I heard him, Mr. Kemp.

555
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:59,049
I guess something knocked the wax outta my ears

556
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:03,470
'cause I heard him loud and clear.

557
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:05,472
And that's why I am sitting here now.

558
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:14,064
Was this, uh-

559
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:19,611
kid who killed your father black?

560
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:21,404
You know, I don't remember.

561
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:25,492
Hey!

562
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:26,493
Hey, you two!

563
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:27,410
What's up?

564
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:29,913
Hey. Come over on this one. We'll all be on one.

565
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:30,997
Yeah!

566
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,582
All right.

567
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:35,669
Come on, Melanie.

568
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,587
Oh, no.

569
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:38,672
I ain't walkin' around in here.

570
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,674
Don't be a chicken-ass,
Melanie. It's like the sidewalk.

571
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,634
Come on.

572
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:46,554
Come on.

573
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,815
Oh, shit.

574
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:59,818
Uh, hurry up. Come down now. Come down.

575
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:02,862
just step down. Go on hurry. Quickly. Go on.

576
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:05,949
Come on, Melanie, just jump down. come on.

577
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:07,784
Come on now-you just step down. Come on.

578
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:10,912
All right. All right. All right. All right. Jesus.

579
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,168
That's it.

580
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:18,044
All right.

581
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:20,714
That's it.

582
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,132
All right, Melanie.

583
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,805
Come on.

584
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:31,850
Come on. That's it.

585
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:33,018
just a little more.

586
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:37,814
Oh my God!

587
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:39,316
Oh my God.

588
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:40,483
What a disaster...

589
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:52,329
Oh, man.

590
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:54,039
Shit.

591
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,593
I think I'm gonna throw up.

592
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:08,511
No! Don't, don't throw up!

593
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:10,263
Help me down!

594
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:13,266
Oh, my God.

595
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,524
Oh my God, I am horribly sorry for having offended Thee

596
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,443
and I detest all my sins because I dread

597
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,528
the loss of heaven and the pain of hell.

598
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,120
Let go.

599
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,789
I ain't lettin' go.

600
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:37,374
Hurry up before it moves!

601
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:40,293
Hey, Melanie, just jump, man. Fuck it!

602
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,212
Why don't you jump off something

603
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:44,589
if you're so freakin' hot to jump?

604
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:48,635
Melanie, I'll give you five dollars if you jump.

605
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,304
I know where you got that five dollars!

606
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,098
So I'm offering it to you.

607
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:57,102
You can take it and shove it up the guy's nose.

608
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:03,900
Well, are you just gonna stand there

609
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:12,242
or are you gonna help me down?

610
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:14,244
I got you.

611
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:17,664
I'm saved.

612
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:18,998
Wonderful.

613
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,917
It's moving.

614
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:23,294
Oh, I think I broke a nail.

615
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:37,267
He said that the Democrats would enforce

616
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:39,853
the recently enacted civil rights laws which

617
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:43,690
were initiated by Kennedy and his martyred brother.

618
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:46,192
johnson, quoted from the Oval Office

619
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,611
declared that Senator Goldwater's policies

620
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:53,867
would lead the U.S. into a
hopeless land war in Southeast Asia.

621
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:55,702
In Neshoba County, Mississippi

622
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,495
the bodies of three civil rights workers-

623
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,208
Hello?

624
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:46,211
Hello, Linda?

625
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:48,046
Hi, Heinz.

626
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:50,757
Did you know I was back?

627
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:53,593
Uh-yeah, yeah I did.

628
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:57,263
Oh you did, huh?

629
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:00,934
Listen, listen, I got you a present.

630
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:02,936
Uh, guess what it is.

631
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,395
I don't know. What?

632
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,855
I said guess.

633
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:08,107
Uh-flowers?

634
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:11,236
No.

635
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,530
You're wrong.

636
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:16,032
Listen, listen, I want you to meet me

637
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:19,285
at twelve o'clock at the Oval Fountain.

638
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:23,957
No, I don't meet nobody at midnight nowhere.

639
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,625
You'll meet me.

640
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:26,709
Or what?

641
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:28,795
You'll meet me

642
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,755
because if you don't meet me-

643
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:36,427
I don't know, something might happen.

644
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:40,723
How's your friend, uh, what's his name?

645
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:43,726
I ain't even going out with him anymore. We broke up.

646
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:49,274
Oh, yeah? Well, maybe you
won't mind if I pay him a visit.

647
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:51,651
All right. I'll meet you.

648
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:52,777
Don't be late.

649
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:54,070
Yeah, I'll be there.

650
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:55,321
Goodbye, Linda.

651
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:01,244
...last few weeks of uncertainty

652
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:04,497
has ended in the knowledge of the murder of our son

653
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,833
Andrew Goodman...

654
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:10,503
and his companions james Chaney and Michael Schwerner.

655
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:15,425
Hope, slim though it was, has passed away

656
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:18,595
and a painful certainty has come.

657
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:22,932
Our grief, though personal

658
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:25,435
Hello, Harry?

659
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:29,439
Um, oh, I guess Harry's not there then, huh?

660
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:31,608
Who is this?

661
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:33,818
It's Linda. Do you know when Harry'll be home?

662
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:35,820
I don't know when he'll be back.

663
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:37,822
Well, could you just tell him that I gotta meet Heinz

664
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:40,658
at the Oval by the fountain at 12 o'clock?

665
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:42,785
And I'd-I'd feel a heck of a lot better

666
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:44,871
if Harry was there too.

667
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:46,372
Will you tell him that?

668
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:47,790
All right, I'll tell him.

669
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,251
Okay. Um, goodnight.

670
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:58,801
...people who might go to Mississippi

671
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:02,472
they will go because many believe

672
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:05,475
and I have received hundreds
of letters from young people

673
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:08,895
all over the country expressing this belief.

674
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:11,898
And if they go, if they choose

675
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:15,693
to fight for equality along
with the other young people there

676
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:17,320
they have my heart

677
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:18,821
and they have my strength-

678
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:33,378
Trick or treat.

679
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:37,423
Harry? Where you been?

680
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:40,051
Been out walking.

681
00:44:40,135 --> 00:44:42,845
You want a drink?

682
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:45,181
Come on.

683
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:46,349
All right.

684
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:54,190
Guess it didn't go so well, huh?

685
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:58,528
Why you say that?

686
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:02,198
'Cause you haven't said yes
to a drink in about a century.

687
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:03,783
Well, you're right.

688
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:06,536
It didn't go great. Went okay.

689
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:15,586
Where's the Buddha?

690
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:17,588
I got him locked in the kitchen.

691
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:20,550
Ma, why'd you lock him in the kitchen?

692
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:22,385
You're lucky I didn't send him out after you.

693
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:24,262
I told you not to lock him in the kitchen.

694
00:45:24,346 --> 00:45:26,472
Harry, you've been gone eight hours.

695
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:29,142
I've been gone six and a half hours.

696
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:31,310
All right, six and a half hours.

697
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:34,480
Six and a half hours is a very long time in Harlem.

698
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:38,818
Mother, you worry too much.

699
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:40,486
You know what happened today?

700
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,155
No, what happened?

701
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:44,157
You know those three kids in M ississippi?

702
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:46,117
Yeah, Goodman, Chaney and Schwerner, what about 'em?

703
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:49,328
They're dead.

704
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:51,122
I know they're dead, Ma.

705
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:52,498
What do you mean, you know they're dead?

706
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,292
Their parents just found out.

707
00:45:54,376 --> 00:45:57,086
Everybody knows they've been dead for weeks.

708
00:45:57,129 --> 00:45:59,338
What do you mean, everybody?

709
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:37,835
I woulda gotten a strike, but
without my thumbnail, I'm no good.

710
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:42,048
Listen, did we do anything last night?

711
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:43,800
Whaddaya mean?

712
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:47,804
I mean I woke up with no clothes on.

713
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:50,348
No, I didn't do anything.

714
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:54,727
Good.

715
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:00,066
Excuse me.

716
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:02,652
Where the hell you been?

717
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:05,071
I've been through three friggin' neighborhoods

718
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:05,822
lookin' for you.

719
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:08,991
Where you been? You been all your time with these guys?

720
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:10,243
Where have I been?

721
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:12,328
Yeah.

722
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:15,665
Excuse me if I don't feel like
explainin' that to you, Sal.

723
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:20,711
I got a five-dollar bill that
you gave these guys, ya big shot!

724
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:22,004
What?

725
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:26,175
What! What! Don't gimme that "what" shit.

726
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:30,930
Oh, boy. Your mother is like insane.

727
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:32,265
She don't know where you are.

728
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:33,850
She's sittin' by the phone, staring at the phone

729
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:35,560
like it was a crystal ball or some shit, Melanie

730
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:37,353
but it don't ring, 'cause you don't call.

731
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:38,563
Shut up about my mother!

732
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:41,107
Don't you mention my frigging' mother to me.

733
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:42,900
They're engaged.

734
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:47,530
You'd swear ta God they was already married.

735
00:47:47,614 --> 00:47:49,740
Where'd you sleep last night?

736
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:52,577
That's none of your goddamn business!

737
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:55,454
Thank you.

738
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:58,124
I'm engaged, too.

739
00:47:58,208 --> 00:47:59,959
Really?

740
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:02,086
Yeah.

741
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:04,463
To her brother, Ronny. He's in the Navy.

742
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:06,382
Well, you never wanna do nothin'.

743
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:07,300
Whaddaya mean, I don't wanna do nothing?

744
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:10,553
Oh, are you gonna give the guy some money?

745
00:48:10,637 --> 00:48:17,226
Oh, oh, I gotta pay this guy's date. Oh, that is rich.

746
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:19,270
That guy's like takin' me dancin' tonight.

747
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:21,480
We'll see about that

748
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:24,108
'cuz I think you got a few things to apologize about.

749
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:26,193
Come on.

750
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:28,738
I gotta apologize to you? For
selling me for five dollars?

751
00:48:28,822 --> 00:48:30,740
I'm worth 25!

752
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:04,565
Hi, Heinz.

753
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:26,671
How you been, huh?

754
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:29,131
I've missed you.

755
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:31,717
You did, huh?

756
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:32,969
Yeah.

757
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:36,389
Outta the whole world

758
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:38,391
you were the only one I missed.

759
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:42,144
Thanks. That's nice.

760
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:44,563
I brought you a present.

761
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:47,149
Yeah?

762
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:48,901
Turn your back.

763
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:52,905
Why?

764
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,907
'Cause it's a surprise!

765
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:58,452
Okay.

766
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:08,170
Don't turn around until I say.

767
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,547
I won't.

768
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:21,267
I really tried to think of somethin' you'd like.

769
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:25,021
Thanks, that's nice.

770
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:29,066
'Cause I want you to like me.

771
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:31,569
I like you, Heinz.

772
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:59,972
Okay. You can turn around now.

773
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,606
I don't see nothing.

774
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:14,236
'Cause you're not lookin' in the right place.

775
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:15,696
Look in the water!

776
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:36,675
Huh, they're so cute!

777
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:41,097
I wanted to get you a present.

778
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:44,433
I tried to think a somethin' that you'd like.

779
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:47,812
They're unbelievable. Where'd you get 'em?

780
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:51,357
From the zoo.

781
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:53,275
You stole 'em outta the Bronx Zoo?

782
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:57,113
Yeah. I climbed over the fence with a bag.

783
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:59,782
It was easy. No, you know, no big thing.

784
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:01,450
They keep 'em outside.

785
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:03,327
You gotta take 'em back, you know.

786
00:52:03,411 --> 00:52:05,204
What?

787
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:08,207
Otherwise they'll die. They need special stuff.

788
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:10,292
They're a present.

789
00:52:10,335 --> 00:52:12,878
Yeah, I know, but serious now, you gotta take 'em back.

790
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:16,048
I thought you'd like 'em, 'cause you like animals.

791
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:18,300
I do like 'em, but that a... that ain't the point.

792
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:20,010
But, then you take 'em, then.

793
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:23,013
I can't, Heinz. I mean, it won't be right.

794
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:25,641
They're like
- they're like wild things, you know

795
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:27,643
they, they ain't like dogs or some shit.

796
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:31,355
They belong in a zoo. In a zoo, right?

797
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:37,403
You know?

798
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:39,572
You don't want my present?

799
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:41,615
No.

800
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:05,139
God.

801
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:25,201
It's all right.

802
00:53:25,243 --> 00:53:27,703
It's all-it's all right.

803
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:33,250
It's just that when somebody gives you a present

804
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:36,921
you should take it, that's all.

805
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:38,923
It's all right.

806
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:43,636
There's another one over there.

807
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:47,932
I'll give you that one...

808
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:51,477
and this time you'll take it, right?

809
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:53,687
All right.

810
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:07,451
Come here.

811
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:31,850
Now, here's your present, Linda.

812
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,143
Take it.

813
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:39,942
What do you say?

814
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:41,277
Thank you.

815
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:45,114
You're welcome.

816
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:48,492
Are you gonna give me something?

817
00:54:48,576 --> 00:54:52,037
Whaddaya want?

818
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:53,872
A thankâ€you kiss.

819
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:04,967
That's good. That's good.

820
00:55:05,051 --> 00:55:07,136
I better be gettin' home. I...

821
00:55:07,178 --> 00:55:08,721
Oh no, no, not yet.

822
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:10,097
Yeah. I gotta get home. My-

823
00:55:10,181 --> 00:55:11,974
my father ain't feelin' good.

824
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:13,642
And I've got-I gotta take care of your present.

825
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:15,894
I gotta fix him up with water and stuff.

826
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:21,233
All right-gimme, uh, gimme another kiss.

827
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:49,386
Gin.

828
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:52,514
I'm going to bed.

829
00:55:52,557 --> 00:55:54,475
If you want another drink, make it yourself.

830
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:56,852
No, I gotta get up early. Arthur's calling me tomorrow.

831
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:58,520
Arthur the Negro?

832
00:55:58,605 --> 00:56:00,856
Yeah, Ma, Arthur the Negro's gonna call me

833
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:02,858
and gimme the verdict whether I go or not.

834
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:05,194
Not that it didn't seem pretty clear, like I said.

835
00:56:05,278 --> 00:56:07,363
Speaking of calls, you got a call.

836
00:56:07,405 --> 00:56:09,198
I did. Who?

837
00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:10,616
That girl, what's her name-she was here today?

838
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:13,369
Linda called? What'd she say?

839
00:56:13,411 --> 00:56:17,081
Oh, you know-something like this afternoon.

840
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:18,374
You already said no.

841
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:21,293
Be more specific, please.

842
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:23,879
Don't play the cop with me, sonny boy.

843
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:25,881
What did she say?

844
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:29,385
She hadda meet Heinz somewhere and she was scared.

845
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:30,969
Where?

846
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:34,765
The Oval, at the fountain at midnight.

847
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:37,101
Why didn't you tell me?

848
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:39,478
You already said no.

849
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:40,896
Why didn't you tell me?

850
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:43,816
Figure it out!

851
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:47,069
You're so determined to kill
yourself, one way or the other.

852
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:49,071
If they won't let you go to M ississippi

853
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:52,157
then you'll go out and lock
horns with some nutcase here!

854
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:54,410
You're just like your goddamn father

855
00:56:54,452 --> 00:56:57,830
Lord have mercy on his dumbass hero soul!

856
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:59,081
I'm going to bed!

857
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:00,207
I'm going out.

858
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:01,250
Take the Buddha.

859
00:57:01,334 --> 00:57:02,793
What?

860
00:57:02,877 --> 00:57:04,169
Take the Buddha. He needs the walk.

861
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:05,838
Christ Almighty!

862
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:07,047
Buddha!

863
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:12,052
Bye.

864
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:28,193
It's open.

865
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:35,784
You gotta help me do something.

866
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:36,827
Come on.

867
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:07,816
I wanna leave this penguin with you, james.

868
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:08,901
Oh, no.

869
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:11,695
Yeah. You gotta take care of this penguin for me.

870
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:13,238
Why don't you
- why don't you take him to your shop?

871
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:14,823
You've got the cages and everything.

872
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:16,241
I can't go back there.

873
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:18,827
Heinz could be waiting for me.

874
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:20,913
I don't know, why, why don't you go to the police?

875
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:22,414
Police? What's that gotta do?

876
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:24,249
Why, 'cause he murdered a penguin?

877
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:25,751
How much time you think he's gonna get for that?

878
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:27,753
Oh, I gotta get some sleep.

879
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:29,838
I could go stay at my Aunt Pam's house.

880
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:31,757
Oh, she don't give a shit if I stay out late.

881
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:33,675
We could figure about all this tomorrow.

882
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:37,012
But, uh, that means you gotta, you gotta take care

883
00:58:37,096 --> 00:58:40,182
of this penguin for me tonight. Okay?

884
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:42,851
Okay?

885
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:44,102
Okay.

886
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:45,270
All right.

887
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:54,947
No, Millie, I will not hit the kid.

888
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:56,114
I don't care what he did.

889
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:56,782
Excuse me, sir.

890
00:58:56,866 --> 00:58:57,699
Hold on.

891
00:58:57,742 --> 00:58:58,742
Yeah, I just don't believe

892
00:58:58,826 --> 00:59:00,118
in hitting my own kid, will ya.

893
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:00,994
Excuse me-

894
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:01,745
There's plenty of other guys down here to hit

895
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:04,748
if I wanna hit somebody. All right?

896
00:59:04,832 --> 00:59:06,041
Hey!

897
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:19,930
Uh, excuse me.

898
00:59:20,014 --> 00:59:22,057
Can I help you?

899
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:24,059
I need help.

900
00:59:24,143 --> 00:59:26,395
Did you explain your problem
to the Sergeant at the desk?

901
00:59:26,437 --> 00:59:27,563
Hey.

902
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:32,317
You look just like Ed Fitzgerald, may he rest in peace.

903
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:33,986
I'm his son.

904
00:59:35,488 --> 00:59:38,323
Did anybody ever tell you he saved my life?

905
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:40,409
You Bigfoot Sullivan?

906
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:45,914
The very same.

907
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:49,042
Listen, I need help now, fast.

908
00:59:59,053 --> 01:00:00,596
Come on, kiddo.

909
01:00:00,638 --> 01:00:02,431
There we go. Yeah.

910
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:08,687
That outta hold you.

911
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:09,813
You got any fish?

912
01:00:09,897 --> 01:00:11,440
Fish?

913
01:00:11,524 --> 01:00:14,192
Yeah, I thought he might be hungry.

914
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:16,778
No, I don't have any fish.

915
01:00:16,821 --> 01:00:19,656
We'll just have to hope he likes beer.

916
01:00:19,741 --> 01:00:20,782
Thanks, James.

917
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:44,723
I don't wanna walk into the neighborhood.

918
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:46,892
Why not?

919
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:49,227
I told ya my Aunt Pam's only
two stops away on the trains.

920
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:50,979
We could take the trains.

921
01:00:51,022 --> 01:00:53,148
Huh. We?

922
01:00:53,232 --> 01:00:56,485
Absolutely. Look, I'm protecting you now.

923
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:03,992
No, wait a minute.

924
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:08,246
What?

925
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:09,498
Linda...

926
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:11,750
What?

927
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:17,172
You gotta kiss me about, uh, six times right now.

928
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:20,258
Oh, come on. We're in a hurry.

929
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:21,927
No, there's got to be time for this.

930
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:23,261
Well, what if I don't want to, huh?

931
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:24,680
You gotta. It's your duty, okay?

932
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:26,556
It's like a medical emergency.

933
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:34,356

One-two-

934
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:37,150
three-

935
01:01:37,235 --> 01:01:39,069
four-

936
01:01:39,153 --> 01:01:40,112
five-

937
01:01:40,196 --> 01:01:41,279
six.

938
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:57,170
Come on, chucklehead.

939
01:02:05,596 --> 01:02:07,723
What is it?

940
01:02:07,765 --> 01:02:09,516
I think your dog sees something.

941
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:14,938
It's a bird.

942
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:18,567
It's a big dead bird.

943
01:02:18,609 --> 01:02:20,986
I thought it was a bloody foot or some shit.

944
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:23,155
But it's just a big dead penguin.

945
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:25,323
So some nutcase killed a bird.

946
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:28,410
That's bird blood over there. It's just bird blood.

947
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:30,662
I think it's a penguin.

948
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:32,622
So where's Linda?

949
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:35,167
Probably where we outta be. Home in bed.

950
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:44,509
What did you call me?

951
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:46,136
Chucklehead.

952
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:46,762
You want to stay pretty?

953
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:50,015
You like birdbrain better?

954
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:51,600
Yeah, birdbrain. That's, uh

955
01:02:51,642 --> 01:02:53,351
that's way up there.

956
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:57,481
Yeah, yeah, it's right up there with geekface.

957
01:02:57,565 --> 01:02:58,607
Hi, Linda.

958
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:03,361
No!

959
01:03:05,323 --> 01:03:06,323
Shit!

960
01:03:08,409 --> 01:03:10,702
Leave her alone!

961
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:12,162
Get away from her!

962
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:20,629
Get away from her!

963
01:03:25,218 --> 01:03:26,259
Get away!

964
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:29,721
Get off her!

965
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:33,308
Heinz! Heinz! Heinz! Look at me!

966
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:34,976
Look at me!

967
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:37,479
Get the fuck off her!

968
01:03:42,026 --> 01:03:44,903
Linda!

969
01:03:52,578 --> 01:03:54,204
No!

970
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:40,250
Who's he calling?

971
01:04:40,334 --> 01:04:46,756
He's callin' the girl's house to see if she's there.

972
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:47,966
Penguin.

973
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:50,302
Yeah.

974
01:04:50,386 --> 01:04:53,221
Who'd kill a penguin?

975
01:04:53,264 --> 01:04:56,141
An Eskimo might. For food.

976
01:04:56,225 --> 01:04:58,768
An Eskimo, huh?

977
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:00,812
Ain't no Eskimos around here.

978
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:06,484
No, but an Eskimo is a kind of I ndian.

979
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:08,486
You trying to pin this on the Indians too?

980
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:10,322
Oh no.

981
01:05:10,406 --> 01:05:13,491
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no.

982
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:16,953
No, this was Heinz.

983
01:05:17,038 --> 01:05:21,833
There ain't no Eskimos in the Bronx...yet.

984
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:24,002
She's not there. She never got home.

985
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:28,590
Call in, okay? See if anything's been reported.

986
01:05:28,633 --> 01:05:30,467
Hell of a dog. St. Bernard, right?

987
01:05:30,551 --> 01:05:32,010
Yeah.

988
01:05:32,094 --> 01:05:33,678
He acts like a friggin' bloodhound.

989
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:35,722
Yeah, well, they're rescue dogs, you know.

990
01:05:35,806 --> 01:05:37,140
They use 'em for findin' people
that get lost in the Alps.

991
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:40,602
Okay, we'll be right in!

992
01:05:40,686 --> 01:05:44,314
Hey. They just brought in a guy we should see.

993
01:05:48,277 --> 01:05:49,778
Did you see where he went?

994
01:05:49,862 --> 01:05:51,863
No, they were gone. This is all I found.

995
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:53,365
Somebody check on Heinz's mother?

996
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:55,033
We sent a patrolman over there

997
01:05:55,117 --> 01:05:56,326
but the mother said she ain't seen him.

998
01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:57,953
Did the patrolman stay?

999
01:05:58,037 --> 01:05:59,955
No, but I sent over a plainclothes.

1000
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:02,123
Good.

1001
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:06,962
Then let's go. I think we
both had the same stupid idea.

1002
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:21,393
Hey, I seen Sullivan just going.

1003
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:23,061
He travels with a dog now, huh?

1004
01:06:23,145 --> 01:06:25,188
Yeah, he's a regular Sergeant Preston.

1005
01:06:29,610 --> 01:06:30,735
33rd Precinct.

1006
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:31,403
Sully?

1007
01:06:31,487 --> 01:06:33,989
Sullivan? No, he just left.

1008
01:06:34,073 --> 01:06:35,448
I'm just checking to say that I'm here.

1009
01:06:35,533 --> 01:06:36,324
Stakeout?

1010
01:06:36,409 --> 01:06:37,325
Yeah.

1011
01:06:37,368 --> 01:06:38,785
You see the apartment?

1012
01:06:38,869 --> 01:06:39,744
Ah, I'm looking up there right now.

1013
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:40,620
Any action?

1014
01:06:40,705 --> 01:06:42,789
Nah. Nothing's going on.

1015
01:06:42,873 --> 01:06:44,249
All right. Check in on the hour.

1016
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:45,500
And don't fall asleep.

1017
01:06:45,584 --> 01:06:46,918
Right.

1018
01:06:49,588 --> 01:06:50,672
Call you tomorrow.

1019
01:06:50,715 --> 01:06:53,174
All right.

1020
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:57,012
Now, ready to sit up here with me?

1021
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:08,189
Happy?

1022
01:07:08,232 --> 01:07:10,358
You know, Melanie

1023
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:14,070
I don't like it, your always
sittin' in the back seat with Brita.

1024
01:07:14,155 --> 01:07:16,364
I can't believe that I broke this nail.

1025
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:19,117
I'm talkin' to you. I'm talkin' to you.

1026
01:07:19,201 --> 01:07:21,870
And, and you're all the time getting high.

1027
01:07:21,954 --> 01:07:23,872
Tonight is the first time

1028
01:07:23,956 --> 01:07:26,458
I seen you and Brita straight at one and the same time

1029
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:30,920
in like, I don't know, forever.

1030
01:07:31,005 --> 01:07:32,047
Sal...

1031
01:07:32,089 --> 01:07:33,423
What?

1032
01:07:33,507 --> 01:07:35,258
Would you please take me home?

1033
01:07:35,342 --> 01:07:37,052
I'm very tired.

1034
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:48,313
Look, what's the dog's name?

1035
01:07:48,397 --> 01:07:49,397
The Buddha.

1036
01:07:49,482 --> 01:07:51,316
Buddha.

1037
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:55,111
All right. Give the Buddha the sweater to smell.

1038
01:07:55,196 --> 01:07:56,738
Listen, I don't know if this is gonna work

1039
01:07:56,822 --> 01:07:58,782
you know, this ain't exactly the Alps.

1040
01:07:58,866 --> 01:08:00,700
I don't know why you drafted this nutcase

1041
01:08:00,785 --> 01:08:03,953
to do your job in the first place, Officer Dragnet.

1042
01:08:04,038 --> 01:08:06,081
Hey, look, you.

1043
01:08:06,165 --> 01:08:09,959
I got a All Points out for Heinz right now.

1044
01:08:10,044 --> 01:08:12,921
I got his apartment staked out.

1045
01:08:12,963 --> 01:08:14,589
Now that's about all that I can do

1046
01:08:14,673 --> 01:08:16,299
that makes any real sense.

1047
01:08:16,383 --> 01:08:18,426
But that's not enough for me, all right?

1048
01:08:18,469 --> 01:08:22,347
So I'm down here in the friggin'
subway with a St. Bernard

1049
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:24,140
doin' somethin' that, like as not

1050
01:08:24,225 --> 01:08:26,184
back at the Precinct is gonna get me nominated

1051
01:08:26,268 --> 01:08:28,645
for Hoople of the Year!

1052
01:08:28,729 --> 01:08:30,855
Now I can live with that, but please

1053
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:34,776
don't make me think about it too much.

1054
01:08:34,819 --> 01:08:36,903
Now this guy is here because he owns a dog.

1055
01:08:36,987 --> 01:08:38,947
I'm not gonna start askin' why you're here

1056
01:08:38,989 --> 01:08:44,285
unless you start bustin' my hump. All right?

1057
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:46,121
So give the stupid dog the stupid sweater to smell

1058
01:08:46,205 --> 01:08:48,540
and let's see what happens!

1059
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:58,299
He's smellin' it.

1060
01:08:58,384 --> 01:09:03,179
I think he's eatin' the friggin' thing!

1061
01:09:03,264 --> 01:09:04,889
I think he's doing it.

1062
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:06,683
I think he picked up the trail.

1063
01:09:06,767 --> 01:09:08,685
Okay. I guess we follow the dog.

1064
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:52,247
Look, I'm sorry

1065
01:10:52,331 --> 01:10:54,082
I gave you such a hard time before.

1066
01:10:54,124 --> 01:10:55,667
I appreciate what you're doin'.

1067
01:10:55,751 --> 01:10:57,252
Is she your girlfriend?

1068
01:10:57,336 --> 01:11:00,630
Yeah... nah... you know, it's on and off.

1069
01:11:00,714 --> 01:11:02,090
Don't worry about nothin'.

1070
01:11:02,174 --> 01:11:04,676
Guys like this Heinz, they get wound up real good

1071
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:06,511
then they bust like a two-dollar watch.

1072
01:11:08,514 --> 01:11:10,598
Stay with Sullivan! I'll get him!

1073
01:11:10,641 --> 01:11:12,600
Let's go-but don't get ahead of me!

1074
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:34,455
All right, my friend, don't move, please!

1075
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:04,444
Linda's in there!

1076
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:31,179
Mazola!

1077
01:12:31,263 --> 01:12:32,930
Yeah?

1078
01:12:33,015 --> 01:12:35,558
Are you dead?

1079
01:12:35,642 --> 01:12:39,103
No. Is Heinz dead?

1080
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:41,564
No.

1081
01:12:41,648 --> 01:12:45,693
Then-the night's over for me

1082
01:12:45,778 --> 01:12:47,612
but not for you.

1083
01:12:47,696 --> 01:12:52,450
I'll have you in Jacobi Emergency in ten minutes.

1084
01:12:52,534 --> 01:12:54,577
That's it for you guys.

1085
01:12:54,661 --> 01:12:57,372
From here on in it's strictly O. K. Corral time.

1086
01:13:01,585 --> 01:13:06,047
All right, I'm sorry. Okay? I apologize.

1087
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:12,220
Well, that's very sweet, but I do not accept.

1088
01:13:12,262 --> 01:13:14,555
Come on, Melanie.

1089
01:13:14,598 --> 01:13:18,434
What do you want me to say? I'm sorry, I said.

1090
01:13:18,519 --> 01:13:20,812
Don't do this to me, Melanie.

1091
01:13:20,896 --> 01:13:22,647
I've been sick about doin' what I did, okay?

1092
01:13:22,731 --> 01:13:24,607
I've been sick about it.

1093
01:13:24,691 --> 01:13:27,985
But you've been fucked up all the time and I...

1094
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:32,782
I figure one day we're gonna have kids.

1095
01:13:32,866 --> 01:13:35,159
I don't want want their mother in the back seat

1096
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:37,286
poppin' pills with Brita.

1097
01:13:59,393 --> 01:14:01,811
You all right?

1098
01:14:01,895 --> 01:14:02,854
What?

1099
01:14:02,938 --> 01:14:03,813
You all right?

1100
01:14:03,897 --> 01:14:06,524
Yeah. You?

1101
01:14:06,608 --> 01:14:09,735
Yeah. What was that?

1102
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:12,530
I dunno. Some friggin' total maniac.

1103
01:14:14,408 --> 01:14:16,701
♫ I n Dublin's fair city ♫

1104
01:14:16,785 --> 01:14:20,121
♫ Where the girls Are so pretty ♫

1105
01:14:25,377 --> 01:14:27,837
♫ Had a wheelbarrow ♫

1106
01:14:27,921 --> 01:14:30,798
♫ Through the streets Broad and narrow ♫

1107
01:14:32,593 --> 01:14:35,470
♫ Crying cockles and mussels ♫

1108
01:15:14,635 --> 01:15:16,427
Who is it?

1109
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:20,264
It's me!

1110
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:22,600
Maybe you should come back in the morning

1111
01:15:22,684 --> 01:15:24,852
and we can have a nice breakfast.

1112
01:15:24,895 --> 01:15:27,021
Open the fuckin' door!

1113
01:15:31,944 --> 01:15:33,528
Oh, you brought home a friend.

1114
01:15:33,612 --> 01:15:36,531
Yeah. I brought home a girlfriend.

1115
01:15:36,573 --> 01:15:39,242
A girlfriend. That's nice.

1116
01:15:39,326 --> 01:15:42,370
You'll probably be getting
married soon and leave the nest.

1117
01:15:42,454 --> 01:15:43,621
Should I put on some music?

1118
01:15:43,705 --> 01:15:46,207
No. No music.

1119
01:15:46,291 --> 01:15:50,044
Would your friend like something to eat?

1120
01:15:50,087 --> 01:15:51,128
A sandwich?

1121
01:15:51,213 --> 01:15:54,590
No.

1122
01:15:54,675 --> 01:15:56,801
She's tired, ain't she? Let her sleep.

1123
01:15:56,885 --> 01:15:58,302
I'll put a blankie on her.

1124
01:15:58,387 --> 01:15:59,762
No, I said no!

1125
01:15:59,846 --> 01:16:01,973
Okay.

1126
01:16:02,057 --> 01:16:04,392
Oh I was havin' the most beautiful dream

1127
01:16:04,476 --> 01:16:06,102
when you rang the bell.

1128
01:16:06,186 --> 01:16:07,812
Your father was still alive

1129
01:16:07,896 --> 01:16:12,275
and, and we was eatin' fish.

1130
01:16:12,359 --> 01:16:13,943
You're dreamin' right now.

1131
01:16:14,027 --> 01:16:15,653
Me? No.

1132
01:16:15,737 --> 01:16:18,406
I'm awake now, Heinz. Can I play some music?

1133
01:16:18,448 --> 01:16:20,908
No. You're sleepin'.

1134
01:16:20,993 --> 01:16:22,243
No. I'm not.

1135
01:16:22,286 --> 01:16:25,746
Wake up. Wake up, Ma!

1136
01:16:25,831 --> 01:16:27,748
I'm not sleepin'.

1137
01:16:27,833 --> 01:16:30,418
Look at me.

1138
01:16:30,460 --> 01:16:33,337
Look. At. Me.

1139
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:36,465
What do you see?

1140
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:38,676
My boy, my little boy.

1141
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:41,012
Wake up. I'm tellin' you!

1142
01:16:41,096 --> 01:16:42,597
What was that?

1143
01:16:42,639 --> 01:16:44,098
Oh, no!

1144
01:16:50,564 --> 01:16:52,273
The cops been here?

1145
01:16:52,357 --> 01:16:54,400
A policeman came and asked about you before

1146
01:16:54,484 --> 01:16:56,777
but I told him you wasn't lost, you was just out.

1147
01:16:56,820 --> 01:16:59,155
Listen!

1148
01:16:59,239 --> 01:17:00,990
I'm gonna die tonight, Ma.

1149
01:17:01,074 --> 01:17:04,619
No. Let me, let me play some music...

1150
01:17:04,661 --> 01:17:07,371
I'm gonna die tonight, Ma.

1151
01:17:07,456 --> 01:17:10,541
Just once-just once

1152
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:14,962
before I die-

1153
01:17:15,047 --> 01:17:16,881
I'd like ya ta see me.

1154
01:17:16,965 --> 01:17:18,883
I see you.

1155
01:17:18,967 --> 01:17:20,843
Who am I?

1156
01:17:20,927 --> 01:17:22,511
You're my little Heinz.

1157
01:17:22,596 --> 01:17:24,722
Where have I been?

1158
01:17:24,806 --> 01:17:26,390
I don't know.

1159
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:28,184
I've been in jail, Ma.

1160
01:17:28,268 --> 01:17:29,393
No.

1161
01:17:29,478 --> 01:17:32,063
I've been in jail.

1162
01:17:32,147 --> 01:17:34,065
And now I'm out and the cops are comin' for me again.

1163
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:35,900
And they're gonna kill me.

1164
01:17:35,984 --> 01:17:37,568
No. I'm-I'm-
I'm gonna go.

1165
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:39,070
What's my name?

1166
01:17:39,154 --> 01:17:40,988
Heinz.

1167
01:17:41,073 --> 01:17:43,074
Who am I to you?

1168
01:17:43,158 --> 01:17:45,409
You're my boy.

1169
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:48,996
And what's your boy gonna do tonight?

1170
01:17:51,917 --> 01:17:56,337
Tell me.

1171
01:17:56,421 --> 01:18:00,007
Tell me!

1172
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:01,175
He's gonna die.

1173
01:18:11,019 --> 01:18:23,656
Thank you.

1174
01:18:36,002 --> 01:18:37,169
Thank you, ma.

1175
01:18:40,382 --> 01:18:42,633
Oh, Heinz!

1176
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:44,218
Heinz!

1177
01:18:46,138 --> 01:18:48,013
Holy shit.

1178
01:18:52,227 --> 01:18:53,394
Watch this dog.

1179
01:18:57,941 --> 01:18:59,358
Call an ambulance!

1180
01:19:07,659 --> 01:19:08,951
Linda, you in there?

1181
01:19:11,246 --> 01:19:12,788
Linda!

1182
01:19:12,873 --> 01:19:14,457
Be quiet!

1183
01:19:34,895 --> 01:19:36,103
Hey, hey, hey.

1184
01:19:36,188 --> 01:19:37,521
Yeah, I'll be right there, sir, just a minute.

1185
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:38,606
Where the hell's the stakeout?

1186
01:19:38,690 --> 01:19:40,191
Under that mess.

1187
01:19:55,415 --> 01:19:56,832
The woman on the sidewalk's dead.

1188
01:19:56,917 --> 01:19:58,667
Neighbors say it's Heinz's mother.

1189
01:19:58,752 --> 01:20:01,378
What happened?

1190
01:20:01,463 --> 01:20:02,421
Let's go in.

1191
01:20:02,506 --> 01:20:03,422
He's got a gun.

1192
01:20:03,673 --> 01:20:04,965
I don't care. We gotta get her.

1193
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:05,591
But he's got a gun.

1194
01:20:05,675 --> 01:20:07,551
I don't care! I don't care!

1195
01:20:07,636 --> 01:20:08,552
James.

1196
01:20:08,637 --> 01:20:10,346
James!

1197
01:20:10,430 --> 01:20:12,515
You know, forget about the gun, Harry.

1198
01:20:12,599 --> 01:20:15,976
I could just kill myself bangin'
into this door over and over!

1199
01:20:30,826 --> 01:20:33,577
I want the two of you to go cover the fire escape.

1200
01:20:37,707 --> 01:20:39,834
And I want you on the front door, all right?

1201
01:20:39,918 --> 01:20:41,001
Yes sir, you got it.

1202
01:20:43,338 --> 01:20:44,338
He's on the roof.

1203
01:20:58,687 --> 01:20:59,895
He's going to throw her off.

1204
01:20:59,980 --> 01:21:01,772
No, he won't.

1205
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:04,608
Sully, we've got a guy up on the roof over there.

1206
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:06,110
Where, here?

1207
01:21:06,194 --> 01:21:07,862
No, right behind ya, next door.

1208
01:21:07,904 --> 01:21:08,988
Let's go.

1209
01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:14,535
Let's rush him. We'll knock him right off.

1210
01:21:14,619 --> 01:21:16,036
No, no violence.

1211
01:21:16,079 --> 01:21:18,789
No
- What are you, nuts?

1212
01:21:18,874 --> 01:21:20,749
You save that shit for M ississippi.

1213
01:21:57,621 --> 01:21:58,621
Heinz.

1214
01:22:05,295 --> 01:22:06,670
Let her go.

1215
01:22:06,755 --> 01:22:08,881
You still love me?

1216
01:22:10,091 --> 01:22:11,300
Yeah.

1217
01:22:15,639 --> 01:22:16,639
Come here.

1218
01:22:19,059 --> 01:22:20,809
Come here to me.

1219
01:22:20,894 --> 01:22:25,022
I'm not going to lift a finger to you, Heinz.

1220
01:22:25,106 --> 01:22:26,941
Those days are gone for me.

1221
01:22:32,989 --> 01:22:36,158
Just let me take the girl off
the ledge before she falls.

1222
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:43,040
Do whatever you want to me.

1223
01:22:43,124 --> 01:22:45,668
Just let me take the girl off the ledge.

1224
01:22:45,752 --> 01:22:49,546
If you get a clear shot, take
him down. He's a cop killer.

1225
01:22:49,631 --> 01:22:52,257
I'll try, but one nudge and the girl's dead.

1226
01:22:59,808 --> 01:23:02,017
You don't want to hurt her now, do you?

1227
01:23:18,785 --> 01:23:19,827
Taking him out.

1228
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:34,758
Sullivan, there's too much goin' on here.

1229
01:23:34,843 --> 01:23:36,301
I ain't gonna risk another shot.

1230
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:58,615
Let her go! Let her go, you bastard!

1231
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:00,617
Run!

1232
01:24:00,702 --> 01:24:02,619
Are you all right?

1233
01:24:02,704 --> 01:24:03,704
Linda!

1234
01:24:03,788 --> 01:24:04,872
You look at me!

1235
01:24:04,914 --> 01:24:05,914
Linda!

1236
01:24:06,916 --> 01:24:08,167
Go hide.

1237
01:24:40,909 --> 01:24:42,326
Come on! Come on!

1238
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:43,869
Come on!

1239
01:24:44,788 --> 01:24:45,913
Come on!

1240
01:25:38,633 --> 01:25:42,052
Sorry.

1241
01:25:51,771 --> 01:25:53,897
Harry...

1242
01:25:53,982 --> 01:25:56,859
I know you, Harry.

1243
01:25:56,943 --> 01:26:01,071
You've always been good, and I've always been bad, huh?

1244
01:26:01,156 --> 01:26:04,491
Ain't that right, Harry?

1245
01:26:04,534 --> 01:26:06,994
You love me?

1246
01:26:07,036 --> 01:26:10,247
You ain't got the right.

1247
01:26:10,331 --> 01:26:14,835
If I let you go, would you kill me now?

1248
01:26:14,919 --> 01:26:17,671
If I gave you the shot

1249
01:26:17,755 --> 01:26:19,840
would you throw my ass off this roof, huh?

1250
01:26:19,883 --> 01:26:21,884
Please?

1251
01:26:21,968 --> 01:26:23,510
No.

1252
01:26:25,847 --> 01:26:31,185
Then, good boy, you tell me this.

1253
01:26:31,227 --> 01:26:34,688
What good are you to me now?

1254
01:26:47,243 --> 01:26:48,327
Okay.

1255
01:27:58,106 --> 01:28:02,359
Maybe there are I ndians in the friggin' neighborhood.

1256
01:28:05,863 --> 01:28:10,492
Hey. Better have somebody take a look at that.

1257
01:29:09,177 --> 01:29:11,928
Fell? He threw her out the window.

1258
01:29:12,013 --> 01:29:13,847
Such a cheerful woman.

1259
01:29:13,890 --> 01:29:16,183
She had a screw loose.

1260
01:29:16,225 --> 01:29:17,768
Pst. Still.

1261
01:29:17,852 --> 01:29:20,062
I saw the stain on the sidewalk.

1262
01:29:20,146 --> 01:29:22,314
Sad. Sad.

1263
01:29:24,984 --> 01:29:27,277
Excuse me.

1264
01:29:27,362 --> 01:29:29,196
Hello.

1265
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:31,031
Oh, my.

1266
01:29:31,115 --> 01:29:33,075
Could you tell me which way is Leland Avenue?

1267
01:29:33,159 --> 01:29:36,411
Two blacks-blocks

1268
01:29:36,496 --> 01:29:37,788
that way.

1269
01:29:37,872 --> 01:29:39,456
Thank you.

1270
01:29:46,923 --> 01:29:49,549
You know, uh-

1271
01:29:49,592 --> 01:29:52,219
someone who I intend to work with once told me

1272
01:29:52,303 --> 01:29:54,971
that a Negro couldn't walk through this neighborhood.

1273
01:29:55,056 --> 01:29:57,974
You ever heard anything so absurd?

1274
01:29:58,059 --> 01:29:59,893
Thanks for directions.

1275
01:30:23,876 --> 01:30:26,461
Excuse me, is this the Fitzgerald residence?

1276
01:30:26,546 --> 01:30:28,004
Yeah, it is.

1277
01:30:28,089 --> 01:30:29,256
Is Harry home?

1278
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:30,757
Yeah.

1279
01:30:30,842 --> 01:30:33,176
I'm Samuel Kemp, here to see him.

1280
01:30:33,261 --> 01:30:35,637
It's nice to see you, Samuel.

1281
01:30:35,721 --> 01:30:36,930
Come on in.

1282
01:30:40,309 --> 01:30:41,351
Go on.
