1
00:00:58,851 --> 00:01:00,937
The forensic service is here,
hurry up.

2
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,920
She bled yet...

3
00:01:09,563 --> 00:01:11,163
It's so clean.

4
00:02:09,724 --> 00:02:12,578
(Episode 19: No one knows)

5
00:02:12,602 --> 00:02:15,398
I won't buy back the company.

6
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:21,664
There's no one left by my side
who can run the company.

7
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:25,695
Then I have no choice but to sell
it to a different group.

8
00:02:47,398 --> 00:02:49,598
You should go back home, Mr. Ahn.

9
00:02:51,953 --> 00:02:53,553
What a sad life.

10
00:03:11,367 --> 00:03:12,929
<i>I...</i>

11
00:03:12,938 --> 00:03:14,343
<i>Died.</i>

12
00:03:18,148 --> 00:03:19,555
(The day after Park Bok-ja's death)

13
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:21,079
Detective Lee.

14
00:03:21,102 --> 00:03:22,805
We checked with the security company.

15
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:25,921
They said someone voided
their contract 15 days before.

16
00:03:25,945 --> 00:03:27,117
Who voided it?

17
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:28,617
It says Park Joo-mi.

18
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,968
Park Joo-mi?

19
00:03:30,992 --> 00:03:33,125
It's the oldest daughter-in-law.

20
00:03:33,695 --> 00:03:36,335
So we can't check the security
camera footage?

21
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,445
She's definitely been murdered.

22
00:03:41,469 --> 00:03:42,930
But what's up with this will?

23
00:03:42,954 --> 00:03:45,546
This is her call records from
her cellphone company.

24
00:03:47,188 --> 00:03:50,656
Park Joo-mi is the last person Park
Bok-ja talked to before she died.

25
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,992
Before that, Park Bok-ja spoke to Cheon
Bang-soon for a minute and 30 seconds.

26
00:03:53,016 --> 00:03:54,890
She's accused of stealing
by Park Joo-mi.

27
00:03:54,914 --> 00:03:57,749
The last text message in her inbox
says, "Mrs. Cho's daughter is"

28
00:03:57,773 --> 00:04:00,304
in a hospital in Gyeonggi-do."

29
00:04:00,523 --> 00:04:02,117
Mrs. Cho?

30
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:03,257
The one who ran away?

31
00:04:03,281 --> 00:04:04,414
Who sent the text?

32
00:04:04,438 --> 00:04:05,578
Here.

33
00:04:06,124 --> 00:04:07,796
Here, Pungseok-jung.

34
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,420
Pungseok-jung?

35
00:04:12,912 --> 00:04:14,859
Oh, welcome!

36
00:04:22,227 --> 00:04:23,827
Let's talk for a bit.

37
00:04:38,242 --> 00:04:42,414
Park Bok-ja came and ordered the pufferfish
porridge personally for Mr. Ahn?

38
00:04:44,422 --> 00:04:45,765
Yes.

39
00:04:45,789 --> 00:04:49,189
Father did really love pufferfish porridge
from here.

40
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:52,773
He never had any problem from it.

41
00:04:54,297 --> 00:04:57,296
But why did he have such a serious
stomach issue from it this time?

42
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,828
He could've died if things
got any worse.

43
00:05:01,953 --> 00:05:03,499
I'm sorry for what happened.

44
00:05:03,523 --> 00:05:05,507
I thought I was careful when I was
making it.

45
00:05:07,063 --> 00:05:09,000
You expect me to believe that?

46
00:05:09,359 --> 00:05:11,406
What kind of a place is Pungseok-jung?

47
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:15,421
You don't even accept money for food if
there's even a piece of fish bone.

48
00:05:15,445 --> 00:05:16,757
However...

49
00:05:16,773 --> 00:05:19,624
You didn't get rid of poison in pufferfish
and made porridge out of it?

50
00:05:19,632 --> 00:05:21,280
And it was a mistake?

51
00:05:21,304 --> 00:05:21,960
Ma'am.

52
00:05:21,984 --> 00:05:24,851
Were you really trying to kill Park Bok-ja?

53
00:05:27,836 --> 00:05:30,140
What are you saying? I...

54
00:05:30,242 --> 00:05:32,366
I don't mess around with food.

55
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:35,187
You didn't think Mr. Ahn
would eat it, right?

56
00:05:35,211 --> 00:05:37,477
You didn't know that he came back.

57
00:05:39,164 --> 00:05:42,497
Is our conversation being
recorded right now too?

58
00:05:44,843 --> 00:05:47,828
Go and give a thorough testimony
at the police station.

59
00:05:47,852 --> 00:05:52,288
Otherwise, I'll make sure the entire world
knows that you've been selling

60
00:05:52,304 --> 00:05:55,085
every information about people
who live in Gangnam.

61
00:05:56,906 --> 00:05:58,506
Ma'am, please don't!

62
00:05:59,343 --> 00:06:01,010
That'll be the end of me.

63
00:06:02,492 --> 00:06:04,225
Why'd you do such a thing?

64
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:05,975
I just...

65
00:06:07,351 --> 00:06:10,007
I just wanted to make her suffer a little.

66
00:06:10,695 --> 00:06:14,007
I know how much poison it takes
to kill someone or just cause

67
00:06:14,023 --> 00:06:15,632
a bit of a stomach.

68
00:06:15,656 --> 00:06:17,389
I just wanted to show her.

69
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:21,694
"If you mess with me, you can
get hurt,"

70
00:06:21,718 --> 00:06:24,185
was the warning I wanted to give her.

71
00:06:24,983 --> 00:06:27,866
It's the only type of power I have.

72
00:06:41,804 --> 00:06:43,404
<i>Ah-jin.</i>

73
00:06:44,296 --> 00:06:46,257
<i>Are you suspecting me too?</i>

74
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:50,837
<i>I was going to live like
a good and kind person.</i>

75
00:06:52,062 --> 00:06:53,351
<i>But always!</i>

76
00:06:53,359 --> 00:06:56,132
<i>Something bad always happens.</i>

77
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:04,592
<i>It's the food from Pungseok-jung.</i>

78
00:07:04,616 --> 00:07:10,421
<i>She's been recording all the conversations
the maids of Gangnam would have.</i>

79
00:07:10,445 --> 00:07:13,772
That's what Park Ji-young said to
Woo Ah-jin via text.

80
00:07:13,906 --> 00:07:15,413
Recording? No way!

81
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:18,421
Many different types of people
go in and out of that place,

82
00:07:18,445 --> 00:07:20,445
it's a ridiculous speculation.

83
00:07:20,789 --> 00:07:23,304
You should come and investigate
for yourself.

84
00:07:23,531 --> 00:07:25,731
We'll just leave it at that then.

85
00:07:27,812 --> 00:07:30,796
You made pufferfish porridge
for Mr. Ahn, and

86
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,546
a little bit of poison was found in it?

87
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:33,272
Yes.

88
00:07:33,296 --> 00:07:34,101
But...

89
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:36,624
Park Ji-young isn't the one who
gave you the order?

90
00:07:36,984 --> 00:07:38,124
Right.

91
00:07:39,742 --> 00:07:42,742
Cheon Bang-soon gave a testimony
about that.

92
00:07:42,898 --> 00:07:46,298
She said it must've been ordered
by Park Ji-young.

93
00:07:47,156 --> 00:07:49,210
Why would she do such a thing?

94
00:07:49,234 --> 00:07:53,030
Probably because once Mr. Ahn died,
Park Ji-young would get even more

95
00:07:53,046 --> 00:07:55,313
of his possessions as inheritance.

96
00:07:56,414 --> 00:07:59,347
Anyhow, I was never asked for
such a favor.

97
00:08:00,242 --> 00:08:01,741
Last February 28th...

98
00:08:01,765 --> 00:08:04,432
Where were you at the time of her death?

99
00:08:16,593 --> 00:08:18,660
What do you think you're doing?

100
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,508
What?

101
00:08:20,921 --> 00:08:21,687
What?

102
00:08:21,703 --> 00:08:23,303
You...

103
00:08:23,812 --> 00:08:25,398
Were you trying to kill me?

104
00:08:25,414 --> 00:08:27,014
You didn't die.

105
00:08:29,023 --> 00:08:33,241
Mr. Ahn passed out after
eating that porridge of yours.

106
00:08:35,194 --> 00:08:36,593
Mr. Ahn ate it?

107
00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:41,507
What do you think is faster, to tell people
that someone ate your food and passed out?

108
00:08:41,531 --> 00:08:45,812
Or that you've been recording all the
conversations about people

109
00:08:45,836 --> 00:08:47,749
of Gangnam? That you've been
eavesdropping?

110
00:08:47,773 --> 00:08:49,188
Or...

111
00:08:49,212 --> 00:08:52,694
Tell everyone both of those things,
one stone with two birds?

112
00:08:55,148 --> 00:08:59,187
I'm not sure how powerful some of
your clients are...

113
00:08:59,484 --> 00:09:03,718
But you've been using them to
get out of trouble so far.

114
00:09:04,265 --> 00:09:09,265
You must know someone really high up
to dodge a tax evasion investigation.

115
00:09:09,921 --> 00:09:11,521
But it's all over.

116
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:15,352
Go turn yourself in to the police.

117
00:09:16,015 --> 00:09:17,530
Before I call the police first.

118
00:09:17,554 --> 00:09:20,874
You didn't know that one of my clients
is the head of all the prosecutors?

119
00:09:22,539 --> 00:09:27,093
I'll make sure to mention that too,
so the head prosecutor will be in

120
00:09:27,117 --> 00:09:28,632
a difficult position as well.

121
00:09:28,656 --> 00:09:32,796
An illegal establishment that's been
dodging paying taxes is involved

122
00:09:32,804 --> 00:09:35,233
with the head prosecutor?

123
00:09:54,234 --> 00:09:55,726
Last February 28th...

124
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,023
Where were you at the time of her death?

125
00:09:59,507 --> 00:10:01,107
I was sleeping at home.

126
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,397
Eat it with ramen you guys work
overnight shifts.

127
00:10:05,421 --> 00:10:08,382
Hey, take this with you! You can't
give me stuff like this.

128
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:10,334
Man, what is this?

129
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:16,304
Ahn Tae-dong was not at the hospital
at the time of Park Ji-young's death.

130
00:10:16,328 --> 00:10:18,128
I met with the nurse there.

131
00:10:18,249 --> 00:10:19,444
What?

132
00:10:23,343 --> 00:10:26,577
It says that you were in the emergency room
at the time of Park Ji-young's death.

133
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:29,304
You had fainted after eating
a pufferfish porridge.

134
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,987
That's how it's recorded.

135
00:10:31,218 --> 00:10:32,585
Yes.

136
00:10:32,945 --> 00:10:37,145
Did you think Park Ji-young gave you
that porridge on purpose?

137
00:10:40,866 --> 00:10:42,132
Yes.

138
00:10:42,953 --> 00:10:44,553
Then...

139
00:10:44,836 --> 00:10:46,702
You must've been very angry.

140
00:10:53,484 --> 00:10:55,751
To the point I wanted to kill her.

141
00:10:57,171 --> 00:10:58,272
So then?

142
00:10:58,296 --> 00:11:00,140
I woke up at a hospital.

143
00:11:00,257 --> 00:11:01,265
So...

144
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:09,882
Kim the Driver, it's me.

145
00:11:09,906 --> 00:11:11,483
I need to get home.

146
00:11:11,507 --> 00:11:13,441
Come to the hospital at once.

147
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:20,658
So I went to the hospital, but
Mr. Ahn wasn't there.

148
00:11:21,093 --> 00:11:22,819
I looked for him for a long time.

149
00:11:24,156 --> 00:11:25,756
Mr. Ahn!

150
00:11:26,414 --> 00:11:28,014
Mr. Ahn!

151
00:11:32,062 --> 00:11:34,226
Mr. Ahn! I'm here, where are you?

152
00:11:34,242 --> 00:11:36,468
He said he'll just stay
at the hospital.

153
00:11:36,617 --> 00:11:38,101
So I just returned home after.

154
00:11:38,718 --> 00:11:40,318
I'm at the hospital.

155
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,920
Just go home.

156
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,490
Father.

157
00:12:10,851 --> 00:12:12,718
Why do you think she did it?

158
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,835
Why did she try to kill me?

159
00:12:16,281 --> 00:12:17,881
It's not like that.

160
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:21,538
She was trying to protect you, actually.

161
00:12:25,001 --> 00:12:27,640
(The day of Park Bok-ja's death)

162
00:12:35,734 --> 00:12:38,163
We need to talk, now.

163
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:52,662
Ah-jin.

164
00:12:53,562 --> 00:12:55,562
Are you suspecting me, too?

165
00:13:02,562 --> 00:13:04,162
I see.

166
00:13:06,289 --> 00:13:07,889
I...

167
00:13:09,461 --> 00:13:12,866
I did come here to seduce Mr. Ahn.

168
00:13:13,984 --> 00:13:16,366
I planned it all out to approach him,

169
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:19,441
and I came to this house
following that plan.

170
00:13:22,546 --> 00:13:24,413
In my entire life...

171
00:13:25,046 --> 00:13:26,646
When would I...

172
00:13:29,336 --> 00:13:33,312
Live in such a nice and fancy house?

173
00:13:37,468 --> 00:13:39,530
When I was little,

174
00:13:40,187 --> 00:13:43,210
we were incredibly poor.

175
00:13:44,101 --> 00:13:47,968
We'd eat dukbokgi after
leaving in it in the water for a while.

176
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:50,791
When you put it in water,

177
00:13:51,961 --> 00:13:54,027
dukbokgi that was only this big

178
00:13:54,945 --> 00:13:56,983
would get this big.

179
00:14:04,265 --> 00:14:05,865
I really...

180
00:14:07,062 --> 00:14:09,640
Wanted to live like a normal human being.

181
00:14:12,475 --> 00:14:14,275
Live a fancy and rich life.

182
00:14:15,617 --> 00:14:17,883
Say boldly whatever I want to say.

183
00:14:18,945 --> 00:14:21,145
Show off to people about my life.

184
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,170
Ride in a nice car.

185
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,120
Be mean to people at times.

186
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,850
Why must a person...

187
00:14:31,492 --> 00:14:33,158
Live like a cow or a pig?

188
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:37,983
Why should people be born with
their level of class seared on their backs?

189
00:14:40,789 --> 00:14:42,389
For me...

190
00:14:44,429 --> 00:14:46,096
I just wanted to erase it.

191
00:14:47,968 --> 00:14:50,374
The seared mark of the level of class.

192
00:14:54,312 --> 00:14:57,163
It was already yours even if you
didn't run away with it.

193
00:14:57,351 --> 00:14:59,327
Why did you run away then?

194
00:15:01,585 --> 00:15:04,318
I thought someone might steal it from me.

195
00:15:08,554 --> 00:15:10,154
In my entire life...

196
00:15:11,382 --> 00:15:13,523
People always stole from me.

197
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:15,764
Even my parents.

198
00:15:16,014 --> 00:15:18,866
God stole them from me.

199
00:15:21,242 --> 00:15:23,663
I was kicked out even after
I was adopted.

200
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,210
I never stole anything but...

201
00:15:29,211 --> 00:15:31,507
people would blame me for it.

202
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:37,876
My life was full of misfortune,
one after another.

203
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,100
That's why I ran away.

204
00:15:47,062 --> 00:15:49,257
I was afraid someone might
steal it all from me again.

205
00:16:01,734 --> 00:16:03,934
But I did feel bad about Mr. Ahn.

206
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:06,279
His children...

207
00:16:07,921 --> 00:16:11,654
Only think of their old father
as a bag full of money.

208
00:16:12,648 --> 00:16:15,030
That's why I...

209
00:16:19,257 --> 00:16:20,857
This time, I...

210
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:26,141
I wanted to take care of Mr. Ahn
and live a good life with him.

211
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:32,170
But...

212
00:16:35,015 --> 00:16:36,615
But then...

213
00:16:38,281 --> 00:16:39,881
But then...

214
00:16:51,671 --> 00:16:55,015
I thought she fed me that
to kill me.

215
00:16:55,421 --> 00:16:58,429
I thought all she wanted was money.

216
00:16:59,007 --> 00:17:03,327
I thought she was after my inheritance
after I die, that she only saw me

217
00:17:03,351 --> 00:17:05,249
as a bag full of money.

218
00:17:06,195 --> 00:17:07,819
Father.

219
00:17:07,843 --> 00:17:10,726
She doesn't wish for your death.

220
00:17:18,031 --> 00:17:22,366
Then it is possible that it was all a part
of Park Bok-ja's plan to

221
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:24,976
kill Mr. Ahn and take all his possessions.

222
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,116
No.

223
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,940
She has no reason to do so.

224
00:17:28,257 --> 00:17:29,857
What do you mean?

225
00:17:30,031 --> 00:17:33,976
She signed a prenup before
she married Mr. Ahn.

226
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:36,303
It's clearly stated there.

227
00:17:36,968 --> 00:17:41,702
In case of Mr. Ahn's death, she gives up
all rights as the legal heir.

228
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:45,790
There's nothing for her to take
if he were to die.

229
00:17:47,078 --> 00:17:50,413
Was Ahn Tae-dong aware of that fact?

230
00:17:51,578 --> 00:17:55,844
He didn't mention anything like that
during his testimony here.

231
00:17:56,812 --> 00:17:58,412
He learned after.

232
00:18:11,961 --> 00:18:14,094
I forgot all about this.

233
00:18:16,859 --> 00:18:18,659
I forgot this even existed.

234
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:30,679
<i>Mr. Ahn was not at the hospital
at the time of Park Ji-young's death.</i>

235
00:18:33,242 --> 00:18:38,632
Only people with legitimate alibis
are just you two, you and Ahn Jae-suc.

236
00:18:42,828 --> 00:18:47,726
The first person who reported
Park Bok-ja's death was Cho Gyung-ja.

237
00:18:47,898 --> 00:18:50,298
She went by "Mrs. Cho" at your home.

238
00:18:50,414 --> 00:18:51,593
Yes.

239
00:18:51,617 --> 00:18:57,374
We got her testimony, and she is under
a theft charge, separately from this case.

240
00:18:57,617 --> 00:19:00,217
But she brought back all that she took.

241
00:19:00,711 --> 00:19:03,077
Did you check what she brought?

242
00:19:04,164 --> 00:19:06,085
Yes, I've checked.

243
00:19:06,718 --> 00:19:08,318
I'm sorry, Ma'am.

244
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,920
I have nothing to say.

245
00:19:12,187 --> 00:19:14,054
Why did you do such a thing?

246
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:18,374
My daughter is sick, and I needed
money.

247
00:19:19,265 --> 00:19:21,882
I was told that your family
is now ruined.

248
00:19:22,023 --> 00:19:23,623
It just happened.

249
00:19:24,937 --> 00:19:26,537
I apologize.

250
00:19:27,226 --> 00:19:29,026
Then why did you come back?

251
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,296
Park Bok-ja called the hospital
my daughter is in.

252
00:19:40,843 --> 00:19:45,443
She said she'd pay for the hospital
fees, and asked me to come back.

253
00:19:48,515 --> 00:19:53,116
She said all will be forgiven
if I just come back.

254
00:19:54,406 --> 00:19:56,272
That's why I came back here.

255
00:20:01,539 --> 00:20:03,139
But...

256
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:41,672
Please take good care of Father.

257
00:20:42,453 --> 00:20:44,253
- I'll get going.
- Ma'am.

258
00:20:45,742 --> 00:20:47,342
But...

259
00:20:47,742 --> 00:20:50,773
I have something to tell you.

260
00:21:13,664 --> 00:21:15,264
Is that true?

261
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:17,170
Yes. I saw her.

262
00:21:17,796 --> 00:21:19,396
I clearly saw her.

263
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:21,225
Did you tell the police?

264
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,569
No.

265
00:21:23,593 --> 00:21:25,193
Why didn't you?

266
00:21:26,312 --> 00:21:27,912
It's just...

267
00:21:30,093 --> 00:21:31,693
Should I?

268
00:21:37,015 --> 00:21:39,765
I'm sure it's not her.

269
00:21:44,546 --> 00:21:48,343
Woo Ah-jin and Ahn Jae-suc must have
alibis at that hour.

270
00:21:48,367 --> 00:21:50,726
Yes, legitimate alibis.

271
00:21:56,487 --> 00:21:58,804
(One hour before Park Bok-ja's death)

272
00:21:59,054 --> 00:22:01,460
What are you doing?
Go and help her!

273
00:22:01,765 --> 00:22:03,365
I can help her?

274
00:22:03,484 --> 00:22:05,084
I guess it's up to you.

275
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:08,874
But in the eyes of a third-person,
it's the right thing for you to do.

276
00:22:08,898 --> 00:22:10,624
You're not a third-person here,
you're a second-person.

277
00:22:10,648 --> 00:22:12,858
If I'm the second-person,
are you the first-person?

278
00:22:12,882 --> 00:22:15,327
Wait, are you talking about you and me?

279
00:22:15,351 --> 00:22:16,951
Ah-jin.

280
00:22:17,116 --> 00:22:20,679
Don't be so distant, you feel
like a complete stranger these days.

281
00:22:21,531 --> 00:22:25,007
Mr. Ahn Jae-suc, pack your bags and
leave first thing tomorrow.

282
00:22:25,031 --> 00:22:27,164
But the third-person is leaving!

283
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:32,088
Then the first-person, me, and
the second-person, you, should stay!

284
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:35,553
I can't believe this, how can you
be so thick-skinned?

285
00:22:35,577 --> 00:22:39,788
Don't you know that I never take back
what I say or revert my decisions?

286
00:22:39,812 --> 00:22:41,412
Don't be like this, Ah-jin.

287
00:22:46,812 --> 00:22:48,412
Go!

288
00:22:52,476 --> 00:22:53,788
Are you OK?

289
00:22:54,046 --> 00:22:55,483
Hold on a second.

290
00:23:00,514 --> 00:23:05,218
But it's because of my wife you get to
have an exhibition in New York and stuff.

291
00:23:05,242 --> 00:23:06,569
Don't hate me too much.

292
00:23:06,671 --> 00:23:08,271
You're a piece of trash.

293
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:10,490
What? Trash?

294
00:23:10,507 --> 00:23:12,030
You...

295
00:23:12,054 --> 00:23:13,858
You were just playing with me,
weren't you?

296
00:23:14,242 --> 00:23:15,999
You were just trying to
get me into bed.

297
00:23:16,007 --> 00:23:17,421
That was all, wasn't it?

298
00:23:17,445 --> 00:23:19,045
What do you take me for?

299
00:23:19,468 --> 00:23:22,507
I'm letting you go like this because
I have to protect my family.

300
00:23:22,531 --> 00:23:24,797
But my feelings for you were true.

301
00:23:25,859 --> 00:23:27,459
I did love you.

302
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,694
What?

303
00:23:28,718 --> 00:23:29,835
Love?

304
00:23:30,656 --> 00:23:32,256
I don't believe this.

305
00:23:32,867 --> 00:23:36,334
You're the most selfish bastard
in the whole world!

306
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:38,882
You love me and you love
your wife too?

307
00:23:38,906 --> 00:23:41,116
You should've been born into a noble
family centuries ago.

308
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,477
I know, right?

309
00:23:42,501 --> 00:23:45,476
I did come to the conclusion that
I don't fit this modern era.

310
00:23:45,789 --> 00:23:47,429
It's all my fault.

311
00:23:47,453 --> 00:23:48,305
I'm sorry.

312
00:23:48,329 --> 00:23:49,929
You...

313
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:51,705
Let me just hit you once.

314
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,320
What?

315
00:23:56,562 --> 00:23:57,944
You're bleeding.

316
00:24:01,828 --> 00:24:03,428
Not there...

317
00:24:03,593 --> 00:24:05,193
It's from your nose.

318
00:24:06,913 --> 00:24:08,513
Nose bleed?

319
00:24:09,586 --> 00:24:12,586
I never got a nose bleed
from anyone before!

320
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:15,210
Do you know how much I hate
violence?

321
00:24:20,045 --> 00:24:21,530
What is this...

322
00:24:22,224 --> 00:24:24,624
My life is ruined!

323
00:24:25,273 --> 00:24:27,554
I can't believe I used to
like a guy like him.

324
00:24:33,648 --> 00:24:35,179
A guy like him...

325
00:24:36,906 --> 00:24:39,506
This is why my love for you
grew cold!

326
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:43,374
I hate violent women the most!

327
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:45,816
I'm bleeding!

328
00:24:46,273 --> 00:24:48,806
I've never even donated
blood before!

329
00:24:55,492 --> 00:24:58,124
But why do you keep saying that
she's the one who did it?

330
00:24:58,148 --> 00:24:59,748
It's this case itself...

331
00:25:00,312 --> 00:25:01,655
It's very strange.

332
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,132
It's all tangled.

333
00:25:03,367 --> 00:25:08,718
It's strange that she's still so involved
in that family matter after her divorce.

334
00:25:08,742 --> 00:25:10,233
That's no reason to suspect her.

335
00:25:10,257 --> 00:25:11,999
I just... Feel that way.

336
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:14,882
You spread the wanted flyer
for Gu Bong-cheol?

337
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:16,727
And asked other departments
to help?

338
00:25:16,751 --> 00:25:18,265
Yes, of course.

339
00:25:18,289 --> 00:25:19,960
But what about Cheon Bang-soon?

340
00:25:19,984 --> 00:25:21,976
Why did she call Park Ji-young first?

341
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,593
She asked for money, but Park Ji-young
refused.

342
00:25:24,617 --> 00:25:25,999
How much did she ask for?

343
00:25:26,023 --> 00:25:27,507
I forgot to ask.

344
00:25:28,195 --> 00:25:31,405
There's a lot more to go over still
about that woman.

345
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:39,866
Cheon Bang-soon.

346
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:42,077
Come out, it's time for your investigation.

347
00:25:45,117 --> 00:25:48,593
You're put under arrest because
you might run away.

348
00:25:48,617 --> 00:25:50,077
But why only me?

349
00:25:50,101 --> 00:25:51,578
She ran away too.

350
00:25:51,602 --> 00:25:52,546
How about Mrs. Cho?

351
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:54,770
She gave back all that she stole.

352
00:25:55,046 --> 00:26:00,710
She'll still be punished, but she's
just not put under arrest.

353
00:26:02,968 --> 00:26:06,491
What did you talk to Park Ji-yong about
when you called her last?

354
00:26:07,187 --> 00:26:08,757
I already told you.

355
00:26:08,781 --> 00:26:10,304
I asked for money.

356
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,617
How much did you ask for?

357
00:26:11,641 --> 00:26:13,241
A million dollars.

358
00:26:13,671 --> 00:26:15,491
A million dollars out of nowhere?

359
00:26:15,515 --> 00:26:17,115
What's that based on?

360
00:26:19,194 --> 00:26:20,794
<i>Where the heck are you?</i>

361
00:26:21,367 --> 00:26:24,718
<i>You should turn yourself in
before the police finds you first.</i>

362
00:26:24,742 --> 00:26:26,194
Give me money.

363
00:26:26,218 --> 00:26:29,812
I'm gonna tell everyone you used
to work at a bar.

364
00:26:29,836 --> 00:26:32,171
You took 75 million dollars and took off?

365
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:35,530
I think you can give me at least
a million dollars.

366
00:26:36,492 --> 00:26:38,733
What did you tell me when you
brought me into this?

367
00:26:38,851 --> 00:26:40,890
You said I won't feel sorry for this.

368
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,600
Hey, Cheon Bang-soon.

369
00:26:42,859 --> 00:26:46,866
I knew you'd be like this, that's why
I threw you away.

370
00:26:48,085 --> 00:26:51,132
You're gonna tell people that I
worked at a bar?

371
00:26:53,132 --> 00:26:55,593
Sure, do as you wish.

372
00:26:57,781 --> 00:27:00,156
You need to clean out your past
completely if you want to

373
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,780
move up to the high class.

374
00:27:01,804 --> 00:27:04,515
You're gonna live the rest of your life
as a former bar hostess?

375
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:07,569
<i>You think people will believe that?</i>

376
00:27:10,179 --> 00:27:12,379
You don't know how great money is.

377
00:27:13,711 --> 00:27:17,593
All the truth and lies you say...

378
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:21,648
Money can resolve all of them.

379
00:27:22,038 --> 00:27:24,554
You just don't know because you never
had any money.

380
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:26,630
Cheon Bang-soon.

381
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:28,585
It's very possible that

382
00:27:28,609 --> 00:27:30,858
you'd be in jail for libel.

383
00:27:31,148 --> 00:27:33,757
Park Bok-ja! I'll never forgive you!

384
00:27:36,257 --> 00:27:39,007
Come back and bring all the stuff
you stole.

385
00:27:39,031 --> 00:27:41,546
Then I'll forgive you.

386
00:27:43,007 --> 00:27:45,546
<i>I'm home now.</i>

387
00:27:46,929 --> 00:27:48,529
I came back.

388
00:27:54,718 --> 00:27:56,318
So...

389
00:27:56,476 --> 00:27:57,968
You went back there?

390
00:27:57,992 --> 00:27:59,592
No.

391
00:28:00,054 --> 00:28:01,654
I didn't go back there.

392
00:28:02,046 --> 00:28:03,038
Why not?

393
00:28:03,054 --> 00:28:04,654
Just...

394
00:28:05,187 --> 00:28:07,320
I just didn't trust her anymore.

395
00:28:09,929 --> 00:28:14,023
Aren't you sad that Park Ji-young's dead?

396
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:21,671
If no one else killed her,
I would've.

397
00:28:24,187 --> 00:28:25,187
Why?

398
00:28:26,593 --> 00:28:28,193
She's just...

399
00:28:28,336 --> 00:28:30,736
Nothing, she's nothing in the world.

400
00:28:31,281 --> 00:28:33,081
But she'd show off so much!

401
00:28:35,828 --> 00:28:39,905
She used to pour drinks for the customers
at the bar and sold her body too.

402
00:28:40,382 --> 00:28:42,182
She was that girl, Cho-hee.

403
00:28:43,148 --> 00:28:44,948
She's no different from me.

404
00:28:49,492 --> 00:28:53,046
What if you did go back home?

405
00:28:53,171 --> 00:28:56,905
What do you think Park Ji-young would've
done with you?

406
00:29:04,882 --> 00:29:06,482
What a fool.

407
00:29:10,726 --> 00:29:13,126
You shouldn't have followed me here.

408
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,726
It's me.

409
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:27,616
I came back home.

410
00:29:28,296 --> 00:29:32,296
I'll pay you for all the jewelry
Cheon Bang-soon stole.

411
00:29:32,421 --> 00:29:36,148
Drop your suit against her.

412
00:29:45,976 --> 00:29:48,671
I'm on my way to the police station
to give my testimony.

413
00:29:50,093 --> 00:29:52,108
Your phone rang several times.

414
00:29:52,687 --> 00:29:54,319
The police ordered me to come in.

415
00:29:55,078 --> 00:29:57,585
Don't dodge it, they'll suspect
you even more.

416
00:29:57,609 --> 00:30:00,585
- I'll talk to them first.
- I'm thinking about it.

417
00:30:00,796 --> 00:30:03,063
I'm thinking about how to testify.

418
00:30:03,414 --> 00:30:04,601
What do you mean?

419
00:30:04,625 --> 00:30:10,291
Should I start lying about the fact that I
went to her hotel room to take her money?

420
00:30:11,015 --> 00:30:13,483
Where do I start? I'm not so sure yet.

421
00:30:13,765 --> 00:30:16,819
She's already dead, it doesn't
matter.

422
00:30:17,539 --> 00:30:19,139
Say whatever you want.

423
00:30:19,726 --> 00:30:21,326
How about Father?

424
00:30:21,648 --> 00:30:23,248
Is he doing alright?

425
00:30:23,617 --> 00:30:26,671
Let's go back home. It's our home again.

426
00:30:28,539 --> 00:30:30,139
She's dead now.

427
00:30:37,507 --> 00:30:40,663
So you're saying... You came back home
from your mother's, and Park Ji-young

428
00:30:40,687 --> 00:30:41,694
was back?

429
00:30:41,718 --> 00:30:42,616
Yes.

430
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:46,140
There's a record of you and Park Ji-young
talking on the phone before she died.

431
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:47,444
What did you talk about?

432
00:30:47,468 --> 00:30:51,905
She just told me that she'd pay for
the jewelry Cheon Bang-soon stole.

433
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:56,460
Where and with whom were you
at the time of her death?

434
00:30:56,804 --> 00:30:58,404
I was with my husband.

435
00:31:00,929 --> 00:31:02,596
You reported him missing.

436
00:31:02,836 --> 00:31:04,491
I did.

437
00:31:04,515 --> 00:31:07,819
But I got in contact with him a few
days before she died.

438
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,913
Where had Jae-gu been that whole time?

439
00:31:11,664 --> 00:31:13,140
Hunting is his hobby.

440
00:31:13,164 --> 00:31:15,616
He said he was at a cabin
he frequents while hunting.

441
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,882
Then...

442
00:31:16,906 --> 00:31:19,179
Where is Ahn Jae-gu now?

443
00:31:27,984 --> 00:31:30,147
It's a members-only resort
called "Leo."

444
00:31:30,171 --> 00:31:33,140
My family members take a break from
time to time here.

445
00:31:34,921 --> 00:31:36,593
Then...

446
00:31:36,617 --> 00:31:38,468
Where's Ahn Jae-hee?

447
00:31:41,664 --> 00:31:43,124
Who is it?

448
00:31:44,546 --> 00:31:45,741
It's me.

449
00:31:52,476 --> 00:31:53,874
Why did you come here?

450
00:31:53,898 --> 00:31:56,319
Jae-suc told me where you were.

451
00:31:56,499 --> 00:31:57,921
Why are you looking like this?

452
00:31:57,945 --> 00:32:00,351
Jae-gu... I'm terrified.

453
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,343
I'm so scared!

454
00:32:02,367 --> 00:32:03,967
Scared about what?

455
00:32:04,328 --> 00:32:06,328
- What do I do?
- About what?

456
00:32:07,211 --> 00:32:08,811
I...

457
00:32:09,132 --> 00:32:10,732
- Saw it.
- Saw what?

458
00:32:11,906 --> 00:32:13,506
The murderer!

459
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,046
What?

460
00:32:16,156 --> 00:32:17,632
That day...

461
00:32:17,656 --> 00:32:19,722
I dozed off for a bit upstairs.

462
00:32:22,648 --> 00:32:25,048
I was thirsty, so I went downstairs.

463
00:32:25,593 --> 00:32:27,265
But...

464
00:32:27,289 --> 00:32:28,289
There...

465
00:32:43,421 --> 00:32:45,021
I saw Park Bok-ja dead!

466
00:32:46,078 --> 00:32:48,249
Mrs. Cho was standing there before.

467
00:32:48,656 --> 00:32:50,789
I got so scared, and I ran away.

468
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:52,592
So...

469
00:32:52,616 --> 00:32:54,788
It was Mrs. Cho who killed her?

470
00:32:55,374 --> 00:32:56,452
Yeah.

471
00:32:58,453 --> 00:32:59,852
What do I do?

472
00:32:59,876 --> 00:33:02,101
I better tell the police, right?

473
00:33:02,226 --> 00:33:03,249
Of course.

474
00:33:03,273 --> 00:33:04,812
But...

475
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:08,437
I already lied about being there
at that hour.

476
00:33:08,836 --> 00:33:10,921
Really? Why'd you lie?

477
00:33:11,609 --> 00:33:14,142
I just didn't want them to suspect me.

478
00:33:14,507 --> 00:33:18,015
Cho Gyung-ja, the first person who saw
Park Bok-ja dead, called the police

479
00:33:18,031 --> 00:33:19,631
at 9:17 AM.

480
00:33:20,336 --> 00:33:24,796
That's when Ahn Jae-hee happened to walk
downstairs to find Cho Gyung-ja.

481
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:25,890
Yes.

482
00:33:25,914 --> 00:33:30,038
And Mrs. Cho mistook Ahn Jae-hee
for the murderer from seeing her run.

483
00:33:30,195 --> 00:33:33,702
These two are testifying that each other
is the murderer.

484
00:33:33,726 --> 00:33:38,335
At the time of Park Bok-ja's death, Cho
Gyung-ja was at her daughter's hospital.

485
00:33:38,445 --> 00:33:39,874
She has a clear alibi.

486
00:33:39,898 --> 00:33:42,231
- And Ahn Jae-hee?
- She was home.

487
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:44,858
She was the only one home when
Park Bok-ja died.

488
00:33:44,992 --> 00:33:47,562
- But then?
- She lied and said she wasn't.

489
00:33:47,586 --> 00:33:51,757
She's not making any sense, she said that
she saw Cho Gyung-ja, yet

490
00:33:51,781 --> 00:33:53,381
she wasn't home.

491
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:55,725
All the children are a little strange.

492
00:33:55,749 --> 00:33:59,663
I feel like that's why the father gave all
his possessions to the caregiver instead.

493
00:34:00,515 --> 00:34:02,101
The oldest son hasn't come in yet?

494
00:34:02,125 --> 00:34:03,991
He said he's coming in soon.

495
00:34:04,664 --> 00:34:06,304
Let's get the murderer quickly.

496
00:34:06,328 --> 00:34:07,647
Who do you think it is?

497
00:34:07,671 --> 00:34:09,271
But...

498
00:34:10,703 --> 00:34:12,303
We found this will.

499
00:34:14,421 --> 00:34:17,819
We compared it to Park Ji-young's
handwriting, and she didn't write it.

500
00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:20,960
We also looked through her belongings.

501
00:34:21,187 --> 00:34:23,788
We found this in her wallet.

502
00:34:27,609 --> 00:34:32,273
The handwriting on the will is the same
as the handwriting on this note.

503
00:34:33,125 --> 00:34:35,191
What is this, and what is this?

504
00:34:37,671 --> 00:34:39,780
You're going to be
in the fourth grade soon?

505
00:34:39,796 --> 00:34:41,108
Yes.

506
00:34:41,132 --> 00:34:43,937
You said the new house is closer
to your school?

507
00:34:43,961 --> 00:34:44,968
Yes, Grandpa.

508
00:34:44,992 --> 00:34:46,413
I can even walk to school.

509
00:34:46,945 --> 00:34:48,749
That's so nice!

510
00:34:50,038 --> 00:34:51,155
Grandpa.

511
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:52,054
Yes?

512
00:34:52,078 --> 00:34:54,093
You changed a lot.

513
00:34:54,802 --> 00:34:56,402
Changed? I did?

514
00:34:56,505 --> 00:34:57,679
Yes.

515
00:34:57,703 --> 00:34:58,772
How?

516
00:34:58,796 --> 00:35:02,937
You got younger than before,
and you speak more nicely too.

517
00:35:03,046 --> 00:35:04,749
Your face looks brighter too.

518
00:35:04,773 --> 00:35:06,483
You don't yell anymore either.

519
00:35:07,179 --> 00:35:08,779
- Me?
- Yes.

520
00:35:10,312 --> 00:35:13,218
I'm glad to hear that, it makes me
feel good.

521
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:17,827
You've been this way
since you met... Grandma.

522
00:35:21,351 --> 00:35:23,015
Let's go, Ji-hoo.

523
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:25,163
Father, we'll get going now.

524
00:35:25,593 --> 00:35:26,976
Please take care.

525
00:35:26,992 --> 00:35:28,483
Ah-jin.

526
00:35:28,507 --> 00:35:29,460
Yes.

527
00:35:29,484 --> 00:35:31,960
Give her a nice funeral.

528
00:35:32,859 --> 00:35:34,218
You should come.

529
00:35:34,328 --> 00:35:35,928
I'm not.

530
00:35:37,929 --> 00:35:41,460
Ji-hoo, can you stay in your cousin's
room for a bit?

531
00:35:41,484 --> 00:35:42,523
OK.

532
00:35:50,218 --> 00:35:54,624
Someone from our family killed her.

533
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,890
I did so many things wrong.

534
00:36:00,875 --> 00:36:02,475
Please don't say that.

535
00:36:03,562 --> 00:36:05,851
I killed her.

536
00:36:08,718 --> 00:36:10,785
It's the same as if I killed her myself.

537
00:36:11,742 --> 00:36:15,542
I can't lift up my face and watch
her go at her funeral.

538
00:36:17,335 --> 00:36:19,296
Take care of her alone.

539
00:36:21,468 --> 00:36:22,468
OK.

540
00:36:22,492 --> 00:36:24,092
I will do as you say.

541
00:36:24,836 --> 00:36:26,436
Live a good life.

542
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:28,670
I was thankful for you.

543
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:34,726
Though I'm now a stranger to Jae-suc,

544
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:36,350
I'll come and visit you.

545
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:40,726
I was happy.

546
00:36:42,453 --> 00:36:44,786
I was happy while I lived with her.

547
00:36:46,015 --> 00:36:47,272
I see.

548
00:36:47,296 --> 00:36:48,896
Yes, you were.

549
00:36:49,093 --> 00:36:50,693
I know.

550
00:36:53,375 --> 00:36:55,483
You know, life...

551
00:36:55,507 --> 00:36:57,774
Now that I lived to be this old...

552
00:36:58,914 --> 00:37:02,991
It's just about eating what you
want to eat,

553
00:37:03,007 --> 00:37:05,788
going to places you want to go,

554
00:37:05,812 --> 00:37:09,616
and meeting people you like to meet.
That's all there is to it.

555
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:15,380
It makes you angry if you can't,
and makes you feel good if you can.

556
00:37:16,281 --> 00:37:19,288
And you just get old throughout
the process, that's life.

557
00:37:20,257 --> 00:37:23,327
While I was living with her, I was...

558
00:37:26,304 --> 00:37:27,904
I was happy.

559
00:37:34,882 --> 00:37:38,233
But where's the young grandma?
Did she go somewhere?

560
00:37:38,257 --> 00:37:39,857
Yes, she did.

561
00:37:40,187 --> 00:37:41,787
To where?

562
00:37:42,046 --> 00:37:44,046
- Overseas.
- Overseas where?

563
00:37:44,757 --> 00:37:47,194
You're gonna attack me
with all these questions now?

564
00:37:47,218 --> 00:37:48,818
Overseas where?

565
00:37:50,343 --> 00:37:53,351
- France.
- France? Why?

566
00:37:56,046 --> 00:37:57,647
She wanted to study art.

567
00:37:57,671 --> 00:37:58,991
Study art?

568
00:37:59,015 --> 00:38:01,530
Yeah. Her dream is to be an artist.

569
00:38:02,156 --> 00:38:03,756
Ah, I see.

570
00:38:03,937 --> 00:38:07,179
I knew it, she just had that vibe.

571
00:38:08,046 --> 00:38:10,312
Hm? What do you mean?

572
00:38:10,476 --> 00:38:12,076
Have you seen her eyes?

573
00:38:13,397 --> 00:38:14,155
Her eyes?

574
00:38:14,179 --> 00:38:16,483
A person's eyes cannot lie.

575
00:38:17,171 --> 00:38:19,571
Her eyes were... How can I say it...

576
00:38:20,084 --> 00:38:22,429
Her eyes were always dreaming something.

577
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,920
Dream?

578
00:38:26,187 --> 00:38:27,819
<i>Dream...</i>

579
00:38:27,843 --> 00:38:29,515
<i>Desire.</i>

580
00:38:29,539 --> 00:38:33,072
<i>What is the difference between
a dream and a desire?</i>

581
00:38:33,523 --> 00:38:36,194
<i>Maybe the kid is right.</i>

582
00:38:36,765 --> 00:38:38,365
<i>Maybe...</i>

583
00:38:38,742 --> 00:38:41,187
<i>I should've just kept dreaming.</i>

584
00:38:47,312 --> 00:38:49,379
If I ever get to be born again,

585
00:38:50,023 --> 00:38:51,623
I want to be a painter.

586
00:39:07,101 --> 00:39:09,434
You're leaving from Ah-jin's place?

587
00:39:09,656 --> 00:39:10,656
Yes.

588
00:39:12,054 --> 00:39:14,387
It's OK for artists to be a little
promiscuous.

589
00:39:14,554 --> 00:39:17,913
I just had a problem with the fact that
it involved someone I'm close to.

590
00:39:19,062 --> 00:39:24,523
First check the guy's social life
before starting dating your next guy.

591
00:39:25,234 --> 00:39:26,834
It's a small country.

592
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:29,812
Maybe it'll get a little bigger
after North and South Korea unify.

593
00:39:29,836 --> 00:39:32,390
Before that happens, everyone
knows each other somehow.

594
00:39:35,562 --> 00:39:37,937
You need to prepare for your exhibition.

595
00:39:37,961 --> 00:39:39,897
Yes, how many paintings are needed?

596
00:39:39,921 --> 00:39:42,321
I need to talk to Ah-jin about that.

597
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:46,503
You heard Park Bok-ja's dead?

598
00:39:47,015 --> 00:39:51,140
Yes, I gave my testimony and proved
Ah-jin and Jae-suc's alibis.

599
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:53,296
Try painting that, "death."

600
00:39:55,820 --> 00:40:00,413
I think that exhibition will change after
this year into a bi-annual event.

601
00:40:00,586 --> 00:40:06,429
It'd only show really colorful paintings
about hope and vision and things.

602
00:40:06,718 --> 00:40:09,640
Rather than a utopia, try depicting
a dystopia.

603
00:40:09,664 --> 00:40:11,483
Try that direction instead.

604
00:40:11,906 --> 00:40:14,593
Would such a dark concept work
for the exhibition?

605
00:40:15,453 --> 00:40:19,890
"War II" was the most impactful painting
you produced.

606
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:24,499
Isn't it inspiring? "Park Bok-ja's death."

607
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,499
She had a very sad life.

608
00:40:28,265 --> 00:40:29,999
I always felt bad for her.

609
00:40:30,804 --> 00:40:33,515
She did taste a moment of bliss
before she died.

610
00:40:34,117 --> 00:40:36,117
But her festival was so short.

611
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:37,850
<i>Someone dies.</i>

612
00:40:38,218 --> 00:40:42,444
<i>And that death just becomes
someone else's topic of gossip.</i>

613
00:40:43,078 --> 00:40:46,858
<i>But if my death can become
a painting...</i>

614
00:40:47,304 --> 00:40:49,851
<i>Life can be so ironic.</i>

615
00:40:50,148 --> 00:40:53,215
<i>Yet there's something so consistent
about it.</i>

616
00:40:56,132 --> 00:40:58,085
Five compasses...

617
00:41:02,609 --> 00:41:04,226
Where's my will?

618
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:05,358
Your will?

619
00:41:05,382 --> 00:41:06,982
Yeah, it's this thing...

620
00:41:07,195 --> 00:41:08,663
Ah-jin.

621
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:10,085
Here.

622
00:41:18,905 --> 00:41:21,100
It's pretty, isn't it?

623
00:41:21,773 --> 00:41:24,148
Yes, it came out really well.

624
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:28,634
It's sad that it came out so pretty.

625
00:41:30,343 --> 00:41:34,085
It's now sewn yet, but I guess
she never got to wear it.

626
00:41:36,476 --> 00:41:38,076
She'd look good in it.

627
00:41:40,726 --> 00:41:44,259
<i>Daesung Pulp has been bought
by Gangil Group today.</i>

628
00:41:44,578 --> 00:41:49,241
<i>Daesung Pulp was sold as soon as
its vice chairperson received</i>

629
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:52,366
<i>all the stocks from the founder, Ahn
Tae-dong, last year.</i>

630
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:54,866
<i>It had gained much public attention
because of it.</i>

631
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:58,327
<i>But as Park Ji-young was murdered
last February 28th,</i>

632
00:41:58,351 --> 00:42:01,054
<i>there are many questions left
unanswered.</i>

633
00:42:01,078 --> 00:42:07,225
<i>The police said that they found
solid evidence left at the scene of murder.</i>

634
00:42:07,249 --> 00:42:10,983
<i>It also said that it's getting closer
to finding the murderer.</i>

635
00:42:14,586 --> 00:42:20,218
It seems that the murdered struck
her twice, which caused her death.

636
00:42:21,718 --> 00:42:24,015
No footprints anywhere in the house.

637
00:42:24,039 --> 00:42:26,705
No fingerprints or bodily fluids either.

638
00:42:26,975 --> 00:42:29,288
Just the fingerprints of the family.

639
00:42:29,312 --> 00:42:30,897
So a family member did it?

640
00:42:30,921 --> 00:42:33,765
Someone who knew the front door pass code.

641
00:42:33,789 --> 00:42:36,460
Someone who knew Park Ji-young as home.

642
00:42:36,476 --> 00:42:41,819
And more than anything, the ones with
the clearest motive to kill are...

643
00:42:41,843 --> 00:42:43,443
The family.

644
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:46,015
And...

645
00:42:46,039 --> 00:42:49,038
The most conclusive evidence is this.

646
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:52,054
I think we have a suspect.

647
00:42:55,679 --> 00:42:58,079
How was going to the police station?

648
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:01,327
It was fine of course, I gave
my testimony.

649
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,293
I hate going to the police station.

650
00:43:05,656 --> 00:43:07,765
I'll distribute the money tomorrow.

651
00:43:07,789 --> 00:43:09,989
I signed for 120 million dollars.

652
00:43:10,116 --> 00:43:11,849
So 4 million dollars each.

653
00:43:16,703 --> 00:43:18,913
Are you guys into something these days?

654
00:43:18,937 --> 00:43:21,070
What's with the looks exchanged?

655
00:43:22,031 --> 00:43:23,085
Are you guys dating?

656
00:43:23,109 --> 00:43:24,976
Stop being ridiculous again.

657
00:43:28,304 --> 00:43:32,093
I'm going to the bathroom, you can
have your secret talk now.

658
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,663
What happened?

659
00:43:38,687 --> 00:43:40,569
The branch manager was so upset.

660
00:43:40,593 --> 00:43:43,233
I guess Park Ji-young had friends
who were journalists.

661
00:43:43,257 --> 00:43:45,960
She fed them information that
MK Capital swindled her.

662
00:43:45,984 --> 00:43:47,054
I know.

663
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,866
We'd be in big trouble if we're caught!

664
00:43:49,890 --> 00:43:51,490
They might kill us!

665
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:55,562
Why do I have to be so scared
just over 10 million dollars?

666
00:43:55,586 --> 00:43:57,624
Let's split it 6 to 4.

667
00:43:58,140 --> 00:43:59,608
Think about all the work I did.

668
00:43:59,632 --> 00:44:01,304
You bastard, don't do this again!

669
00:44:02,359 --> 00:44:03,959
I got blood on my hands!

670
00:44:06,218 --> 00:44:07,818
Did you really...

671
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:09,740
Kill her?

672
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:11,740
It was you?

673
00:44:12,039 --> 00:44:13,538
No, right?

674
00:44:13,562 --> 00:44:19,960
<i>People who've tasted money are not
ashamed about lies or deception.</i>

675
00:44:20,421 --> 00:44:25,835
<i>And they never consider people's lives
more valuable than money.</i>

676
00:44:27,048 --> 00:44:28,421
(Transfer of corpse)

677
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:36,858
The body's been sent to Gangwon Hospital.

678
00:44:37,265 --> 00:44:38,054
OK.

679
00:44:38,078 --> 00:44:42,030
I hope you get through the funeral fine,
and I ask you to return here testify.

680
00:44:42,257 --> 00:44:43,857
I understand.

681
00:44:54,789 --> 00:44:56,922
With this dress, please.

682
00:45:00,281 --> 00:45:03,547
<i>We worry about being unhappy
while we are happy.</i>

683
00:45:03,562 --> 00:45:06,762
<i>And we hope for happiness
while we are unhappy.</i>

684
00:45:07,375 --> 00:45:13,483
<i>More than anything, we live our lives
desiring for something we do not have.</i>

685
00:45:13,937 --> 00:45:17,069
<i>There's more sadness than joy.</i>

686
00:45:17,804 --> 00:45:23,257
<i>A life is filled with pains that are
even greater than sadness.</i>

687
00:45:24,109 --> 00:45:27,624
<i>But I should've been thankful
for life itself.</i>

688
00:45:28,030 --> 00:45:29,233
"Thank you."

689
00:45:29,242 --> 00:45:30,842
"And I love you."

690
00:45:31,867 --> 00:45:36,133
"The life I've lived and all those I got to
meet in my life..."

691
00:45:38,538 --> 00:45:40,835
What is this will?

692
00:45:48,554 --> 00:45:55,023
You went to look for Park Ji-yong at
Saint Palace Hotel last January 23rd.

693
00:45:55,125 --> 00:45:57,725
Then you were stopped by her bodyguard.

694
00:45:58,226 --> 00:46:00,426
Tell me what happened after that.

695
00:46:01,039 --> 00:46:04,155
Park Ji-young felt unsafe from
unending threats from him.

696
00:46:04,179 --> 00:46:05,780
So I took him somewhere else.

697
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:07,546
Why didn't you call the police?

698
00:46:07,570 --> 00:46:09,637
My client didn't wish for it.

699
00:46:09,851 --> 00:46:11,651
I only did what I was told.

700
00:46:11,953 --> 00:46:13,944
Park Ji-young told you to do it?

701
00:46:13,968 --> 00:46:15,116
Yes.

702
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:16,740
So?

703
00:46:16,757 --> 00:46:18,357
Then what happened?

704
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:21,671
I explained it to him so he can
understand.

705
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,030
Then I let him go.

706
00:46:23,054 --> 00:46:24,124
What?

707
00:46:24,148 --> 00:46:27,101
That was also ordered by my client.

708
00:46:30,249 --> 00:46:31,726
But that makes no sense!

709
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:35,550
Ahn Jae-gu's reported missing, no one
knows where he is!

710
00:46:36,359 --> 00:46:38,827
He probably went hunting.

711
00:46:39,101 --> 00:46:40,640
That's what he told me.

712
00:46:40,664 --> 00:46:42,077
He said he's going hunting.

713
00:46:42,086 --> 00:46:43,686
I don't understand this.

714
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:49,460
I'd think he would just go back
to Park Ji-young and threaten her again.

715
00:46:51,023 --> 00:46:54,062
But Park Ji-young is the one who
told you to release him?

716
00:46:54,304 --> 00:46:55,904
Yes.

717
00:47:08,351 --> 00:47:09,772
Yes, Mr. Han.

718
00:47:09,796 --> 00:47:12,194
I caught him and I put him
in a motel nearby.

719
00:47:12,343 --> 00:47:14,655
That's good then, just leave.
It's their family's problem.

720
00:47:14,843 --> 00:47:16,910
No need for us to get involved.

721
00:47:17,257 --> 00:47:19,046
We just do what we need to do.

722
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:20,670
OK, got it.

723
00:47:25,617 --> 00:47:27,350
Did you really go hunting?

724
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:29,280
Yes.

725
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:32,310
Why didn't you go back?

726
00:47:32,937 --> 00:47:36,843
You didn't go back home nor did
you go back to Park Ji-young.

727
00:47:38,031 --> 00:47:39,631
That's because...

728
00:47:39,945 --> 00:47:43,671
I didn't want to pester Park Bok-ja
anymore.

729
00:47:44,968 --> 00:47:46,568
That's all, just...

730
00:47:47,773 --> 00:47:50,053
I just felt like nothing mattered anymore.

731
00:47:50,077 --> 00:47:52,210
Around 2 AM on February 28th,

732
00:47:53,148 --> 00:47:55,681
you were with your wife at Leo Resort?

733
00:47:56,296 --> 00:47:57,241
Yes.

734
00:47:57,265 --> 00:48:00,741
I checked all the security camera
footage that day.

735
00:48:00,765 --> 00:48:06,866
But unfortunately, there was no footage
of your going into your room that day.

736
00:48:06,882 --> 00:48:09,343
I stayed in my room starting the 24th.

737
00:48:09,367 --> 00:48:11,593
I never left the room since.

738
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:14,577
- Where were you that day?
- I was at Leo.

739
00:48:19,687 --> 00:48:21,287
This...

740
00:48:21,796 --> 00:48:23,396
Belongs to you, no?

741
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:30,452
It's the knife you used when you
attempted to kill Park Ji-young before.

742
00:48:31,789 --> 00:48:36,132
You dropped it at the scene of murder.

743
00:48:38,811 --> 00:48:40,744
You didn't realize it, right?

744
00:48:40,765 --> 00:48:42,365
What?

745
00:48:45,375 --> 00:48:47,241
This was found at the scene?

746
00:48:49,921 --> 00:48:54,499
You had a deep hatred towards
Park Ji-young, who's now dead.

747
00:48:55,108 --> 00:48:57,288
You planned to kill her many times!

748
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:59,307
But you failed each time.

749
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:03,858
You learned that she returned home.

750
00:49:04,375 --> 00:49:08,430
And this was on top of how you
mistakenly believed that she tried to

751
00:49:08,454 --> 00:49:11,116
poison your father to death.

752
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:14,304
I'm sure your hatred and anger toward
her were at their extreme.

753
00:49:24,445 --> 00:49:26,046
After you killed her,

754
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:28,390
you immediately left the house.

755
00:49:30,523 --> 00:49:33,952
Then you saw that there were muddy
footprints you left from the rain.

756
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:37,233
So you thought to clean them up.

757
00:49:38,218 --> 00:49:39,818
Then...

758
00:49:45,632 --> 00:49:49,437
You dropped this jack knife
at the front door.

759
00:49:55,757 --> 00:49:57,357
What are you doing here?

760
00:49:57,953 --> 00:49:59,553
Did you really...

761
00:49:59,812 --> 00:50:01,412
Do it?

762
00:50:02,062 --> 00:50:03,491
It wasn't me.

763
00:50:03,515 --> 00:50:05,851
I wasn't in Seoul that day
on February 28th.

764
00:50:06,015 --> 00:50:07,615
I was in Leo.

765
00:50:07,734 --> 00:50:11,523
Boss, please pay me including
the 28th.

766
00:50:17,538 --> 00:50:20,718
Do you think I killed her?

767
00:50:35,070 --> 00:50:36,343
It's all done.

768
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:37,967
Good job.

769
00:50:39,257 --> 00:50:42,324
Go to a sauna or something
and get some rest.

770
00:50:49,586 --> 00:50:52,812
Whom do you think the police suspects
of killing her about now?

771
00:50:53,781 --> 00:50:56,247
Why do you think I let Ahn Jae-gu go?

772
00:50:56,593 --> 00:50:59,187
I wanted him to take care of Park Bok-ja.

773
00:50:59,211 --> 00:51:00,811
That's why I let him go.

774
00:51:00,968 --> 00:51:02,568
So he'll kill her.

775
00:51:02,843 --> 00:51:04,952
But he did something else instead.

776
00:51:04,968 --> 00:51:06,568
What did he do?

777
00:51:55,084 --> 00:51:56,684
Did the funeral go well?

778
00:51:58,467 --> 00:51:59,841
Yes.

779
00:51:59,865 --> 00:52:03,193
What did you do with her belongings?

780
00:52:05,639 --> 00:52:09,287
The things she wanted to have so badly...

781
00:52:11,217 --> 00:52:13,550
I wanted her to take them with her.

782
00:52:14,529 --> 00:52:16,729
The smell of leather's burning...

783
00:52:16,858 --> 00:52:18,810
It was so terrible.

784
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:20,663
What a waste.

785
00:52:20,687 --> 00:52:22,654
You burned such expensive things.

786
00:52:22,678 --> 00:52:24,278
And...

787
00:52:25,795 --> 00:52:29,826
I burned the last gift to send her.

788
00:52:30,670 --> 00:52:32,068
What was it?

789
00:52:38,311 --> 00:52:42,107
- You like paintings?
- I just like looking at them.

790
00:52:42,475 --> 00:52:44,529
Especially because life is so tough.

791
00:52:45,045 --> 00:52:46,779
When I look at paintings...

792
00:52:46,803 --> 00:52:48,662
I feel like I'm being healed.

793
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:50,870
If I ever get to be born again...

794
00:52:51,397 --> 00:52:52,997
I want to be an artist.

795
00:53:03,850 --> 00:53:07,373
We found this from her belongings.

796
00:53:09,170 --> 00:53:11,357
I wrote this.

797
00:53:12,186 --> 00:53:13,060
What?

798
00:53:13,084 --> 00:53:14,630
To explain...

799
00:53:14,654 --> 00:53:18,988
It was homework for the members
at a mind-training class I'm in.

800
00:53:19,365 --> 00:53:21,170
We were supposed to write a will.

801
00:53:24,053 --> 00:53:26,927
But why was it in Park Ji-young's
possession?

802
00:53:29,092 --> 00:53:31,693
I must've dropped it at that house.

803
00:53:34,662 --> 00:53:36,262
Then...

804
00:53:36,279 --> 00:53:38,326
Does this belong to you, too?

805
00:53:38,733 --> 00:53:43,342
(Thank you for doing my laundry.
Please always be happy, wherever you are.)

806
00:53:48,296 --> 00:53:50,029
It seems like an old note.

807
00:53:52,116 --> 00:53:53,716
Yes.

808
00:53:54,530 --> 00:53:56,130
It seems so.

809
00:53:56,975 --> 00:53:58,342
So then...

810
00:53:58,366 --> 00:54:02,803
You said you first met Park Bok-ja,
or Park Ji-young, when you

811
00:54:02,827 --> 00:54:04,787
interviewed her as a caregiver.

812
00:54:04,811 --> 00:54:08,319
But it was long before that, based
on our investigation.

813
00:54:10,124 --> 00:54:14,756
You and Park Ji-young first met
in no other than...

814
00:54:15,132 --> 00:54:18,670
The place where she was staying
as a long-term guest after

815
00:54:18,694 --> 00:54:20,494
she ran off with the money.

816
00:54:21,046 --> 00:54:22,646
It was that hotel.

817
00:54:24,444 --> 00:54:26,100
You really can't remember?

818
00:54:26,124 --> 00:54:27,724
Saint Palace Hotel.

819
00:54:28,311 --> 00:54:29,911
The suite room.

820
00:54:32,679 --> 00:54:34,967
I do... Remember.

821
00:55:12,874 --> 00:55:14,474
But...

822
00:55:16,069 --> 00:55:17,736
I'll be good from now on.

823
00:55:18,858 --> 00:55:20,458
Do you believe me?

824
00:55:21,725 --> 00:55:23,030
I do.

825
00:55:24,218 --> 00:55:25,818
You...

826
00:55:28,147 --> 00:55:31,498
I was always thankful for you.

827
00:55:45,155 --> 00:55:46,755
Here.

828
00:55:48,819 --> 00:55:51,530
I must've left it here, I've been
looking for it.

829
00:57:31,874 --> 00:57:33,178
Hello.

830
00:57:33,202 --> 00:57:37,402
I think I lost my wallet here early
morning of February 28th.

831
00:57:38,132 --> 00:57:40,397
Can I check your security camera footage?

832
00:57:40,421 --> 00:57:42,021
Not right now.

833
00:57:42,202 --> 00:57:44,002
The boss has to approve it.

834
00:57:44,530 --> 00:57:46,530
Can you come tomorrow morning?

835
00:58:10,311 --> 00:58:11,911
Hello, Driver Kim?

836
00:58:14,421 --> 00:58:16,021
I'm at the hospital.

837
00:58:16,929 --> 00:58:18,529
Just leave.

838
00:59:33,425 --> 00:59:35,069
(Woman of Dignity)

839
00:59:35,372 --> 00:59:38,803
We must be destined to meet!
I love Matisse, too.

840
00:59:38,827 --> 00:59:43,834
I do prefer Manet over Matisse.

841
00:59:43,944 --> 00:59:48,366
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have gotten her
into the house.

842
00:59:50,276 --> 00:59:50,647
I'm sorry.

843
00:59:50,865 --> 00:59:55,881
I introduced that painter to you.

844
00:59:56,069 --> 01:00:00,089
I introduced that woman to Father, too.

845
01:00:00,113 --> 01:00:01,713
That's not your fault.

846
01:00:02,011 --> 01:00:04,011
It's the fault of the people
who made those choices.

847
01:00:04,035 --> 01:00:07,456
There are things you can't help,
even though you know.

848
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:11,190
I liked her a lot.

849
01:00:11,355 --> 01:00:12,651
I'm going to the police.

850
01:00:12,675 --> 01:00:14,511
Blame everything on Park Bok-ja.

851
01:00:14,535 --> 01:00:16,135
She's already dead!

852
01:00:16,582 --> 01:00:18,698
Bong-cheol! Gu Bong-cheol!

853
01:00:18,722 --> 01:00:20,229
You have an alibi?

854
01:00:20,253 --> 01:00:22,862
My husband and I will prove
each other's whereabouts.

855
01:00:22,886 --> 01:00:24,987
Joo-mi told me to kill her.

856
01:00:25,011 --> 01:00:26,611
Why did it happen?

857
01:00:26,932 --> 01:00:30,550
Let's do our best for them to consider
your extenuating circumstances.

858
01:00:31,370 --> 01:00:36,300
Tomorrow... Is another day.
