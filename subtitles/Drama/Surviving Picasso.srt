1
00:00:47,713 --> 00:00:48,712
Good morning.

2
00:00:48,714 --> 00:00:50,246
Good morning.

3
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:57,385
Please.

4
00:01:16,134 --> 00:01:17,733
Let's see.

5
00:01:17,735 --> 00:01:19,067
Here.

6
00:01:19,602 --> 00:01:20,834
Cezanne.

7
00:01:20,836 --> 00:01:21,835
A masterpiece.

8
00:01:21,837 --> 00:01:23,336
You like that?

9
00:01:23,338 --> 00:01:24,337
No.

10
00:01:24,339 --> 00:01:25,137
No?

11
00:01:25,139 --> 00:01:26,138
Pointillist.

12
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,439
What? What?

13
00:01:27,441 --> 00:01:28,239
Pointillist.

14
00:01:28,241 --> 00:01:29,840
My version of it.

15
00:01:29,842 --> 00:01:30,841
"Pointillist."

16
00:01:30,843 --> 00:01:32,008
Pointillist.

17
00:01:35,246 --> 00:01:36,845
They are your parents?

18
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:38,713
No.

19
00:01:38,715 --> 00:01:40,181
No.

20
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:43,384
Why, do you paint like this?

21
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,720
Why do you paint like this?

22
00:01:46,722 --> 00:01:47,554
Well...

23
00:01:47,556 --> 00:01:49,522
I'm sorry. That's not mine.

24
00:01:49,524 --> 00:01:52,525
That's, my friend braque, George braque.

25
00:01:52,527 --> 00:01:55,728
It's hard to tell the
difference sometimes.

26
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:57,663
It's all so long ago.

27
00:01:57,665 --> 00:01:59,064
What is it called?

28
00:01:59,066 --> 00:02:02,267
<i>Guitar, bow tie, and fruit bowl.</i>

29
00:02:02,269 --> 00:02:04,602
There's the bow tie...

30
00:02:04,604 --> 00:02:05,469
Good.

31
00:02:05,471 --> 00:02:07,604
But, where is the fruit bowl?

32
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,005
There.

33
00:02:11,007 --> 00:02:12,007
Good.

34
00:02:13,009 --> 00:02:15,409
It is all, fantasy?

35
00:02:15,411 --> 00:02:17,010
All fantasy from up here.

36
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:18,644
This is also by braque.

37
00:02:18,646 --> 00:02:20,045
Matisse, Henri Matisse.

38
00:02:20,047 --> 00:02:21,479
Matisse.

39
00:02:22,482 --> 00:02:23,681
This...

40
00:02:23,683 --> 00:02:26,283
What is the value
you would put on all this?

41
00:02:26,285 --> 00:02:27,851
It's hard to say.

42
00:02:27,853 --> 00:02:29,686
Unfortunately, nobody wants to
pay me much for any of this.

43
00:02:29,688 --> 00:02:31,888
Why don't you make me a reasonable offer?

44
00:02:33,091 --> 00:02:35,291
My wife would have something to say to me

45
00:02:35,293 --> 00:02:36,992
if I brought home a woman like that

46
00:02:36,994 --> 00:02:38,626
to hang on our wall.

47
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:40,628
What about you?

48
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,530
No, I think not. No.

49
00:02:47,302 --> 00:02:48,901
Good evening, sir.

50
00:02:48,903 --> 00:02:49,902
Good evening.

51
00:02:49,904 --> 00:02:51,403
Here we are again.

52
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:52,904
Dora.

53
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:54,906
Pierre.

54
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:56,307
My friends.

55
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:58,309
Friends? Who are they?

56
00:02:58,311 --> 00:02:59,910
They admire you very much.

57
00:02:59,912 --> 00:03:01,511
Of course they do.

58
00:03:01,513 --> 00:03:02,513
Good.

59
00:03:07,517 --> 00:03:08,517
Good. Yes.

60
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:10,317
<i>Bon soir.</i>

61
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,518
Great pleasure.

62
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,519
<i>Bon soir.</i>

63
00:03:12,521 --> 00:03:13,520
My dear.

64
00:03:13,522 --> 00:03:14,522
<i>Bon soir.</i>

65
00:03:16,057 --> 00:03:17,723
Bosches.

66
00:03:17,725 --> 00:03:19,524
I showed them everything.
Matisse...

67
00:03:19,526 --> 00:03:20,391
Here, boy.

68
00:03:20,393 --> 00:03:21,992
Rousseau, braque, everything.

69
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:23,460
I showed them some early
drafts of<i> guernica.</i>

70
00:03:23,462 --> 00:03:25,128
Last year they ransacked my house,

71
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:27,930
and they walked off with my linen
and left my paintings behind.

72
00:03:27,932 --> 00:03:29,364
How insulting.

73
00:03:29,366 --> 00:03:31,899
Preferring my towels and
my sheets to my paintings.

74
00:03:31,901 --> 00:03:33,333
Kazbec! No!

75
00:03:34,669 --> 00:03:36,702
No, no! Bad boy!

76
00:03:36,704 --> 00:03:38,737
How many times do you have to be told?

77
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:40,939
You know very well what your doctor said.

78
00:03:40,941 --> 00:03:41,973
Begging? I'm ashamed.

79
00:03:41,975 --> 00:03:43,341
Who are your friends, Pierre?

80
00:03:43,343 --> 00:03:44,942
Francoise. Genevieve.

81
00:03:44,944 --> 00:03:46,543
What do you do?

82
00:03:46,545 --> 00:03:47,944
I'm a painter.

83
00:03:47,946 --> 00:03:49,545
Painter? Like me. And you?

84
00:03:49,547 --> 00:03:50,379
Painter.

85
00:03:50,381 --> 00:03:52,080
Share the same studio?

86
00:03:52,082 --> 00:03:53,748
Who's your favorite painter?

87
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,615
Van gogh.

88
00:03:54,617 --> 00:03:56,183
Van gogh? Yeah, he's all right.

89
00:03:56,185 --> 00:03:57,184
Yours?

90
00:03:57,186 --> 00:03:58,186
I don't know.

91
00:04:01,023 --> 00:04:02,422
Who are your friends?

92
00:04:02,424 --> 00:04:04,290
Francoise and Genevieve.

93
00:04:04,292 --> 00:04:06,225
They're painters.

94
00:04:06,227 --> 00:04:07,826
What do they paint...

95
00:04:07,828 --> 00:04:09,561
Besides their fingernails?

96
00:04:10,564 --> 00:04:13,164
He's going through his usual routine.

97
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:14,765
"So you're painters.

98
00:04:14,767 --> 00:04:15,966
"I'm a painter, too.

99
00:04:15,968 --> 00:04:18,902
"Come to my studio,
I'd like to show you my work.

100
00:04:18,904 --> 00:04:20,303
"I know your face so well.

101
00:04:20,305 --> 00:04:22,071
I painted it before
you were even born."

102
00:04:22,073 --> 00:04:24,640
You must come to my studio sometime.
I'll show you around.

103
00:04:24,642 --> 00:04:27,576
You know, I've painted your
face before you were born.

104
00:04:27,578 --> 00:04:29,578
No one stops you on the street

105
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,179
and says you're a Picasso?

106
00:04:31,181 --> 00:04:32,847
No? Never?

107
00:05:52,491 --> 00:05:55,492
We have an appointment
to see monsieur Picasso.

108
00:05:55,494 --> 00:05:57,860
He told us to come.

109
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:02,063
To see his work.

110
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:14,408
"That spread over a
sky dripping with herring,

111
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:17,144
"fished out of
a ploughed-over ocean,

112
00:06:17,146 --> 00:06:19,546
broiling under a myriad sun."

113
00:06:19,548 --> 00:06:21,147
"Torso and testicle,

114
00:06:21,149 --> 00:06:23,149
"where's the party you promised

115
00:06:23,151 --> 00:06:25,551
"with fiery men of eternal erections

116
00:06:25,553 --> 00:06:27,553
"rising out of flaming bushes

117
00:06:27,555 --> 00:06:30,155
"to heat up our cold caves?

118
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:31,823
"At least get the soup,

119
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:33,825
so I can warm my feet
in its noodles."

120
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:35,693
"My aunt had a
cat that swallowed a parrot

121
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:38,996
and cried out all day long in a
voice as dulcet as yours..."

122
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:40,831
"Food, food, food!"

123
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,666
"Food! Food!"

124
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:43,466
"Food!"

125
00:06:43,468 --> 00:06:44,667
"Food! Food!"

126
00:06:44,669 --> 00:06:45,768
Good. On.

127
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:48,103
"Lie down, my sweet
turtle, and"... lie down.

128
00:06:48,105 --> 00:06:50,839
"And let me walk your starry planet

129
00:06:50,841 --> 00:06:53,508
with my 6-toed feet
of pliant rubber."

130
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,109
"We're respectable, licensed whores,

131
00:06:55,111 --> 00:06:56,910
"so hold your filthy tongue

132
00:06:56,912 --> 00:06:59,712
and supply us with
your sturdier organ."

133
00:06:59,714 --> 00:07:02,047
"At your service, madame."

134
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:13,189
"They leap over a tub in which
sea urchins are boiling

135
00:07:13,191 --> 00:07:15,925
in an orgasm
of frenetic excitement."

136
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:18,460
"Bubbling water
scalds the lovers..."

137
00:07:18,462 --> 00:07:22,063
Kind of you to spare me the time.

138
00:07:22,065 --> 00:07:23,664
Are you cold?

139
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,600
The other night the water
froze in the fish bowl,

140
00:07:27,602 --> 00:07:29,468
so my goldfish is dead.

141
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:31,470
Imagine, a cold-blooded
creature like a fish

142
00:07:31,472 --> 00:07:34,473
couldn't survive the arctic
climate of my apartment.

143
00:07:34,475 --> 00:07:36,741
Come, let me show you around.

144
00:07:37,477 --> 00:07:39,477
My print room.

145
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:42,746
This is where I print my engravings.

146
00:07:48,486 --> 00:07:51,152
You're now in the labyrinth
of the minotaur.

147
00:07:52,488 --> 00:07:55,088
Aren't you afraid you'll never get out?

148
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,489
No?

149
00:07:57,492 --> 00:07:59,892
You must know that the minotaur perishes

150
00:07:59,894 --> 00:08:03,695
if he doesn't devour at least
2 young maidens a day.

151
00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:07,698
That's my press.

152
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,032
Help me.

153
00:08:11,102 --> 00:08:13,035
That's good.

154
00:08:16,106 --> 00:08:17,405
So, you're painters?

155
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,806
Who is your teacher?

156
00:08:18,808 --> 00:08:20,774
Genevieve is visiting from montpellier

157
00:08:20,776 --> 00:08:22,942
where she's a pupil of maillol.

158
00:08:22,944 --> 00:08:24,176
Maillol.

159
00:08:25,112 --> 00:08:27,045
And who is your teacher?

160
00:08:27,047 --> 00:08:28,446
I don't have one,

161
00:08:28,448 --> 00:08:30,514
but I'm very much a painter.

162
00:08:30,516 --> 00:08:31,915
Really?

163
00:08:32,918 --> 00:08:35,518
Maillol is a very good teacher for you.

164
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,220
When do you go back to montpellier?

165
00:08:38,222 --> 00:08:39,788
The day after tomorrow.

166
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,523
So soon?

167
00:08:41,525 --> 00:08:43,791
You'll be lonely when she's gone.

168
00:08:43,793 --> 00:08:45,125
No.

169
00:08:45,127 --> 00:08:46,626
Come and see me.

170
00:08:46,628 --> 00:08:49,528
But come because you like me...

171
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:52,497
Not as if you're visiting
the holy shrine of Fatima,

172
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:54,665
all right?

173
00:08:57,936 --> 00:09:00,637
Let's go. He's not going
to show us any paintings.

174
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:01,638
Of course he will.

175
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,640
Why else did he invite us?

176
00:09:03,642 --> 00:09:05,908
Don't pretend to be so naive.

177
00:09:21,658 --> 00:09:23,924
After Genevieve left for montpellier,

178
00:09:23,926 --> 00:09:27,427
I didn't return to Picasso's
studio for several weeks.

179
00:09:27,429 --> 00:09:29,529
I deliberately held myself back,

180
00:09:29,531 --> 00:09:33,732
perhaps because I sensed that if I
let myself come too close to him,

181
00:09:33,734 --> 00:09:36,134
my whole life would be totally changed.

182
00:09:36,136 --> 00:09:39,337
It was what happened to everyone
whose life was touched by his.

183
00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:42,006
No one could ever remain the same.

184
00:09:42,742 --> 00:09:45,142
They come once a week to see his papers.

185
00:09:45,144 --> 00:09:48,411
Once a week I tell them, let alone
his parents and his grandparents,

186
00:09:48,413 --> 00:09:51,180
even Picasso's great-grandparents
are not Jewish.

187
00:09:51,182 --> 00:09:52,581
30 for the groceries.

188
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,349
They're thieves.
How much was the wine?

189
00:09:54,351 --> 00:09:55,350
20.

190
00:09:55,352 --> 00:09:56,417
Must be German.

191
00:09:56,419 --> 00:09:57,885
Just change the wine merchants.

192
00:09:57,887 --> 00:10:00,354
You said to bring her straight
in whenever she comes.

193
00:10:00,356 --> 00:10:01,955
Well, she's come.

194
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,759
Good afternoon.

195
00:10:06,761 --> 00:10:09,361
But the poor girl is all wet.

196
00:10:09,363 --> 00:10:10,762
Look at this, sabartes.

197
00:10:10,764 --> 00:10:12,363
Her hair is all wet.

198
00:10:12,365 --> 00:10:13,764
Ines, get me a towel.

199
00:10:13,766 --> 00:10:16,032
I must dry it for her.

200
00:10:16,034 --> 00:10:17,366
Soaking wet.

201
00:10:17,368 --> 00:10:19,501
I had a feeling when I woke up

202
00:10:19,503 --> 00:10:21,503
that you would come today.

203
00:10:21,505 --> 00:10:23,171
It may even have been a dream.

204
00:10:23,173 --> 00:10:25,173
Poor girl comes here drenched to the skin

205
00:10:25,175 --> 00:10:27,175
and in mortal danger
of catching pneumonia,

206
00:10:27,177 --> 00:10:29,377
the least we can do
is dry her hair for her.

207
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,244
Come with me.
I'll do it for you.

208
00:10:33,381 --> 00:10:34,847
This is Ines.

209
00:10:34,849 --> 00:10:35,848
Hello.

210
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:36,648
Hello.

211
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,916
Here. Sit down.

212
00:10:38,918 --> 00:10:41,518
You could even have a bath.

213
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,919
Look. Hot water.

214
00:10:42,921 --> 00:10:44,921
No, don't! It's too hot.

215
00:10:44,923 --> 00:10:46,923
How many places in Paris today

216
00:10:46,925 --> 00:10:48,524
where there's hot water?

217
00:10:48,526 --> 00:10:51,527
So come have a bath any time.

218
00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:54,396
Let's see how good I am
at drying you off.

219
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,399
Good?

220
00:10:57,401 --> 00:10:59,000
Better?

221
00:10:59,002 --> 00:11:00,935
You do it.

222
00:11:23,423 --> 00:11:25,089
Well?

223
00:11:26,425 --> 00:11:27,824
Well, what?

224
00:11:27,826 --> 00:11:30,026
You're not angry with me?

225
00:11:30,028 --> 00:11:31,360
No.

226
00:11:32,963 --> 00:11:35,630
If you don't even push me away,

227
00:11:35,632 --> 00:11:38,966
I might get the idea I could
do anything at all with you.

228
00:11:38,968 --> 00:11:41,835
If you were a properly
brought-up young lady,

229
00:11:41,837 --> 00:11:43,236
you would feel insulted.

230
00:11:43,238 --> 00:11:46,439
Here I am, an artist of some reputation,

231
00:11:46,441 --> 00:11:48,641
and you're an innocent
young girl come to visit,

232
00:11:48,643 --> 00:11:50,142
and what do I do?

233
00:11:50,144 --> 00:11:52,344
I take advantage of you.
I insult you.

234
00:11:52,346 --> 00:11:53,945
I don't feel insulted.

235
00:11:56,448 --> 00:11:58,814
Would you let me do it again?

236
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:02,883
If... if you like.

237
00:12:07,188 --> 00:12:08,754
No.

238
00:12:08,756 --> 00:12:11,123
No, under such conditions...

239
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:14,126
What pleasure is there
in seducing anyone?

240
00:12:14,128 --> 00:12:16,328
Is that what's happening?

241
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:18,263
You're seducing me?

242
00:12:18,265 --> 00:12:20,865
You think you're very
sophisticated, don't you?

243
00:12:20,867 --> 00:12:22,867
But I tell you you don't know anything.

244
00:12:22,869 --> 00:12:24,468
What you looking at?

245
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:25,469
Nothing.

246
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:28,170
Yes, well...

247
00:12:29,473 --> 00:12:31,473
This modern cult of free sex

248
00:12:31,475 --> 00:12:33,475
doesn't interest me at all.

249
00:12:33,477 --> 00:12:36,478
One might as well go for a haircut

250
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,480
or eat a ham sandwich.

251
00:12:38,482 --> 00:12:41,382
There's nothing serious in it.

252
00:12:42,485 --> 00:12:43,485
So...

253
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,920
Shall we do something serious?

254
00:12:46,922 --> 00:12:48,154
Yes.

255
00:12:49,223 --> 00:12:50,855
OK.

256
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:53,457
I'll show you my etchings.

257
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,790
After the liberation of Paris,

258
00:13:30,792 --> 00:13:33,192
Picasso, who was already
a world-famous artist,

259
00:13:33,194 --> 00:13:36,195
also became a hero
of the French resistance...

260
00:13:36,197 --> 00:13:38,797
not that he had
done anything very heroic.

261
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:41,199
He said, "it wasn't that I behaved well",

262
00:13:41,201 --> 00:13:43,401
but that others behaved badly."

263
00:13:43,403 --> 00:13:44,802
From the wild west?

264
00:13:44,804 --> 00:13:46,203
No, I'm from New York.

265
00:13:46,205 --> 00:13:48,805
My mother got that in Times Square.

266
00:13:48,807 --> 00:13:50,406
Picasso's secretary sabartes

267
00:13:50,408 --> 00:13:52,207
claimed that after the war,

268
00:13:52,209 --> 00:13:54,409
tourists only came to Europe

269
00:13:54,411 --> 00:13:56,411
to see the pope, Pompeii,

270
00:13:56,413 --> 00:13:57,812
and Pablo Picasso.

271
00:13:57,814 --> 00:13:58,813
Careful, Pablo.

272
00:13:58,815 --> 00:13:59,814
Cheese.

273
00:13:59,816 --> 00:14:02,149
Yee-hee! All right!

274
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,229
Meanwhile,

275
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,397
I was having my own liberation.

276
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:20,831
For the last few years

277
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:22,833
I'd been wanting to give up my studies

278
00:14:22,835 --> 00:14:24,234
and just paint full time,

279
00:14:24,236 --> 00:14:26,703
but I hadn't dared
mention this to my father.

280
00:14:26,705 --> 00:14:28,104
Not till I met Picasso.

281
00:14:28,106 --> 00:14:31,440
My father had worked hard
to form my character,

282
00:14:31,442 --> 00:14:32,841
to make me like himself...

283
00:14:32,843 --> 00:14:34,442
tough and afraid of nothing.

284
00:14:34,444 --> 00:14:37,244
But when I grew up, I began to
have my own ideas and desires,

285
00:14:37,246 --> 00:14:39,279
and if they were opposed to his,

286
00:14:39,281 --> 00:14:42,482
he'd go wild and become
completely irrational.

287
00:14:42,484 --> 00:14:44,917
I knew that this would
take all my courage.

288
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:47,185
What's the matter with you?

289
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:49,953
Listen...

290
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:51,955
I've made up my mind.

291
00:14:51,957 --> 00:14:54,424
I'm going to study painting full time.

292
00:15:03,467 --> 00:15:05,600
You must be mad.

293
00:15:05,602 --> 00:15:07,768
I am responsible for myself.

294
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:11,872
You will finish your degree in the
humanities and then go on to law school.

295
00:15:11,874 --> 00:15:13,406
I tried all that,

296
00:15:13,408 --> 00:15:15,875
but I found it doesn't suit<i> me.</i>

297
00:15:15,877 --> 00:15:17,877
I'm not going on to law school,

298
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:19,812
but I shall try and be a painter!

299
00:15:19,814 --> 00:15:22,214
I'll give you half an hour.

300
00:15:22,216 --> 00:15:24,683
Go to your room and think it over,

301
00:15:24,685 --> 00:15:27,285
and in half an hour, come back
and tell me you've been a fool.

302
00:15:27,287 --> 00:15:29,086
I don't need to think anything over.

303
00:15:29,088 --> 00:15:31,221
I'm giving you this one chance.

304
00:15:31,223 --> 00:15:32,021
That's all.

305
00:15:32,023 --> 00:15:33,889
If you don't take it,

306
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:36,157
I'll make my own decision for you.

307
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:38,893
I'll have you committed...

308
00:15:38,895 --> 00:15:41,295
Because you are mad.

309
00:15:54,508 --> 00:15:56,274
Is grandma home?

310
00:16:22,532 --> 00:16:23,998
Don't you dare touch me.

311
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,199
Don't dare?

312
00:16:25,201 --> 00:16:27,267
I dare!

313
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:28,268
I dare!

314
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,102
No!

315
00:16:29,104 --> 00:16:32,138
I'll teach you to say no to me!

316
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,507
No one says no to me!

317
00:16:34,509 --> 00:16:36,542
No one says no to me!

318
00:16:36,544 --> 00:16:38,544
No one in this world!

319
00:16:38,546 --> 00:16:39,545
Francoise?

320
00:16:39,547 --> 00:16:40,746
Francoise!

321
00:16:40,748 --> 00:16:42,147
From now on,

322
00:16:42,149 --> 00:16:45,350
you beg for your bread in the streets.

323
00:16:45,352 --> 00:16:46,150
What...

324
00:16:46,152 --> 00:16:47,951
She did it to herself.

325
00:16:47,953 --> 00:16:49,752
He's lying. He did it.

326
00:16:49,754 --> 00:16:51,754
Don't believe her. She's crazy.

327
00:16:51,756 --> 00:16:53,622
I believe her.

328
00:16:53,624 --> 00:16:55,523
It's you who are crazy.

329
00:16:55,525 --> 00:16:56,690
Here, child.

330
00:16:56,692 --> 00:16:59,826
And in<i> my</i> house.
Aren't you ashamed?

331
00:16:59,828 --> 00:17:01,360
Please leave.

332
00:17:01,362 --> 00:17:02,761
Leave.

333
00:17:02,763 --> 00:17:05,463
Leave,<i> leave</i> my house.

334
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:08,165
Francoise will stay with me.

335
00:17:08,167 --> 00:17:09,766
Let her stay with you.

336
00:17:09,768 --> 00:17:11,768
You're welcome to each other...

337
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:13,770
Because I've finished with you.

338
00:17:13,772 --> 00:17:15,438
Both of you!

339
00:17:16,374 --> 00:17:17,706
Finished!

340
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:18,708
There.

341
00:17:24,046 --> 00:17:26,079
Now, you didn't paint the war

342
00:17:26,081 --> 00:17:28,114
because you're not that kind of painter,

343
00:17:28,116 --> 00:17:30,649
but, it is there, just the same.

344
00:17:30,651 --> 00:17:32,050
People were hungry,

345
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:34,652
so I painted sausages and leeks.

346
00:17:34,654 --> 00:17:36,487
Even a casserole can scream.

347
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,700
Do you have an appointment?

348
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:52,402
Yes.

349
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:55,505
He told me to come for a lesson
in engraving this afternoon.

350
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:56,839
Listen...

351
00:17:58,309 --> 00:18:00,909
It will be better for you to go home.

352
00:18:00,911 --> 00:18:02,911
Why?

353
00:18:02,913 --> 00:18:05,046
I'm doing you a favor.

354
00:18:05,048 --> 00:18:06,914
Thank you...

355
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:08,916
But I don't want to anger him

356
00:18:08,918 --> 00:18:11,151
by being late for my lesson.

357
00:18:11,153 --> 00:18:12,585
Excuse me.

358
00:18:12,587 --> 00:18:15,788
So, we are agreed on this and this?

359
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,589
Haven't agreed on anything yet.

360
00:18:17,591 --> 00:18:19,857
Francoise!
This is monsieur kahnweiler.

361
00:18:19,859 --> 00:18:21,258
He's my oldest dealer.

362
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,459
Mademoiselle.

363
00:18:22,461 --> 00:18:23,393
Hello.

364
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:25,061
That is to say that,

365
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:27,863
he shamelessly has exploited
me longer than anyone else.

366
00:18:27,865 --> 00:18:30,265
He gets whatever he wants out of me

367
00:18:30,267 --> 00:18:31,766
by sheer persistence.

368
00:18:31,768 --> 00:18:34,502
He sits there like a big stone
on his German buttocks.

369
00:18:34,504 --> 00:18:36,270
I'd do anything to be rid of him.

370
00:18:36,272 --> 00:18:38,272
I'll send the packers this afternoon.

371
00:18:38,274 --> 00:18:39,606
I haven't said yes.

372
00:18:39,608 --> 00:18:41,007
Shall we say at 4:00?

373
00:18:41,009 --> 00:18:42,775
Look, this may interest you.

374
00:18:44,044 --> 00:18:45,676
I did it in 1902.

375
00:18:45,678 --> 00:18:48,412
Read what I wrote on the bottom there.

376
00:18:48,414 --> 00:18:52,115
<i>"Quando tengas
ganas de joder, jode."</i>

377
00:18:52,117 --> 00:18:53,116
Translate it.

378
00:18:53,118 --> 00:18:54,484
No, no.

379
00:18:54,486 --> 00:18:55,785
Go on.

380
00:18:55,787 --> 00:18:57,787
Well, if you're too coy...

381
00:18:57,789 --> 00:18:59,555
You translate it.

382
00:19:01,292 --> 00:19:02,891
Good-bye,
mademoiselle.

383
00:19:02,893 --> 00:19:05,293
"When you feel
like fucking, fuck."

384
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,897
Why are you wearing this dress

385
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:12,698
for an engraving lesson?

386
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:17,501
Well, one has to dress up
a bit to visit Picasso.

387
00:19:17,503 --> 00:19:19,503
Well...

388
00:19:19,505 --> 00:19:21,171
Yeah.

389
00:19:21,907 --> 00:19:23,806
I want to show you something.

390
00:19:23,808 --> 00:19:25,207
Come with me.

391
00:19:25,209 --> 00:19:26,908
You're a very lazy dog.

392
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:28,309
You're always sleeping.

393
00:19:28,311 --> 00:19:29,910
Maybe he's dead.

394
00:19:31,313 --> 00:19:33,146
I'll come up behind,

395
00:19:33,148 --> 00:19:35,148
catch you if you fall.

396
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:37,350
Don't let anyone in.

397
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:51,329
Well...

398
00:19:53,933 --> 00:19:56,199
Here.

399
00:19:58,536 --> 00:20:00,202
Go on.

400
00:20:08,912 --> 00:20:10,912
Nice view?

401
00:20:11,848 --> 00:20:14,781
Would you like to stay here?

402
00:20:17,085 --> 00:20:18,551
Up here?

403
00:20:18,553 --> 00:20:19,552
Yes.

404
00:20:19,554 --> 00:20:20,553
Alone?

405
00:20:20,555 --> 00:20:21,487
Yes.

406
00:20:21,489 --> 00:20:24,957
I'd bring you food twice a day and...

407
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:27,359
At night we'd go out together

408
00:20:27,361 --> 00:20:29,961
in disguise like the<i> Arabian nights,</i>

409
00:20:29,963 --> 00:20:33,364
and, you'd be my secret.

410
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:35,632
My secret captive.

411
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:41,370
I'd like to be alone and paint all day.

412
00:20:41,372 --> 00:20:44,373
I wouldn't mind losing
my liberty for that.

413
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:48,643
But then you'd have to
lose some of yours, too.

414
00:20:49,379 --> 00:20:52,580
And I'm not so sure you'd like that.

415
00:21:29,417 --> 00:21:31,817
I thought you would be rather androgynous

416
00:21:31,819 --> 00:21:34,286
under all those clothes you always wear.

417
00:21:34,288 --> 00:21:36,154
But you're not.

418
00:21:36,156 --> 00:21:38,689
You're definitely not a boy.

419
00:21:39,425 --> 00:21:41,491
Thank God who made you.

420
00:21:41,493 --> 00:21:45,694
For once he got it absolutely right.

421
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:49,563
Yes.

422
00:22:05,981 --> 00:22:08,781
It's ridiculous the 2 of us
living in different places.

423
00:22:08,783 --> 00:22:09,982
True.

424
00:22:09,984 --> 00:22:12,651
You should be with him
in the grands-augustins.

425
00:22:13,487 --> 00:22:15,653
Give me a good reason why not.

426
00:22:15,655 --> 00:22:16,453
She's young.

427
00:22:16,455 --> 00:22:18,455
You've got to give her time.

428
00:22:18,457 --> 00:22:20,056
I don't have much time.

429
00:22:20,058 --> 00:22:21,457
That's true, too.

430
00:22:21,459 --> 00:22:23,258
What do you mean by that?

431
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,459
I...

432
00:22:24,461 --> 00:22:26,260
You can tell your grandmother today

433
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:29,062
that you're moving out and coming
to live with me, or I'll tell her.

434
00:22:29,064 --> 00:22:31,064
Please, don't say anything.

435
00:22:31,066 --> 00:22:32,465
Why not?

436
00:22:32,467 --> 00:22:34,867
What, is she some sort of an ogre?

437
00:22:34,869 --> 00:22:37,469
Anyway, I'm not scared
of anyone's grandmother.

438
00:22:37,471 --> 00:22:39,270
He's had 100 lives already.

439
00:22:39,272 --> 00:22:43,473
And the whole world knows how
many women he's destroyed.

440
00:22:43,475 --> 00:22:47,076
I couldn't bear it for you, darling.

441
00:22:47,078 --> 00:22:48,877
Do you really think

442
00:22:48,879 --> 00:22:52,480
I'd let myself be destroyed by
a man, even if he is Picasso?

443
00:22:52,482 --> 00:22:55,483
Well, I... I don't
understand you.

444
00:22:55,485 --> 00:22:58,486
It's going against nature.

445
00:22:58,488 --> 00:23:01,822
You are so young.

446
00:23:01,824 --> 00:23:03,924
And he's old.

447
00:23:05,494 --> 00:23:08,027
It's as if you've taken a wrong turning.

448
00:23:08,029 --> 00:23:09,028
No.

449
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,429
For the first time,

450
00:23:10,431 --> 00:23:12,497
I feel that everything is right,

451
00:23:12,499 --> 00:23:14,232
that I'm turned in the right direction.

452
00:23:14,234 --> 00:23:15,733
I'm sure. I'm so sure.

453
00:23:15,735 --> 00:23:18,935
I've never been so sure of
anything in my whole life.

454
00:23:22,272 --> 00:23:24,938
Then it doesn't matter what I say.

455
00:23:26,007 --> 00:23:27,873
Except...

456
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:29,674
I love you.

457
00:23:30,543 --> 00:23:32,743
And whatever happens...

458
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,544
I love you.

459
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:38,547
Good night.

460
00:23:39,816 --> 00:23:42,316
Don't go and live with him, francoise.

461
00:23:42,318 --> 00:23:44,951
Remember these years
won't come back again.

462
00:23:44,953 --> 00:23:46,886
If you waste them...

463
00:23:46,888 --> 00:23:48,520
They're gone.

464
00:23:50,891 --> 00:23:52,690
It's perverse for...

465
00:23:52,692 --> 00:23:55,993
A young girl to live with
her grandmother as you do.

466
00:23:57,096 --> 00:24:00,297
I suppose she's warned you against me?

467
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:02,299
Who needs to be warned?

468
00:24:02,301 --> 00:24:05,001
Your life is not exactly a secret.

469
00:24:05,003 --> 00:24:08,304
Well, there have been a few
women in my life, yes.

470
00:24:08,306 --> 00:24:09,905
Would you stop doing that?

471
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:11,706
Stop it. Don't do it.

472
00:24:11,708 --> 00:24:14,308
Don't... I can't help it
if my hair's falling out.

473
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:16,109
Stop it! Stop it.

474
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:24,716
In fact, there have been several women.

475
00:24:24,718 --> 00:24:26,317
Hundreds, thousands of them.

476
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:27,618
I've lost count.

477
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:30,320
I can't remember how
many of them there are.

478
00:24:30,322 --> 00:24:31,921
So many.

479
00:24:31,923 --> 00:24:33,855
Now there's only you.

480
00:24:35,725 --> 00:24:38,192
I love you more and more every day.

481
00:24:38,194 --> 00:24:40,594
You mean everything to me.

482
00:24:40,596 --> 00:24:42,796
"You mean everything to me.

483
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:44,130
"If I am sad,

484
00:24:44,132 --> 00:24:47,333
"it is because I cannot be with
you as I would like to be.

485
00:24:47,335 --> 00:24:50,336
"I would give anything
for you to be happy.

486
00:24:50,338 --> 00:24:52,738
"My own tears would mean nothing to me

487
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:55,941
"if I could stop you
from shedding even one.

488
00:24:55,943 --> 00:24:57,609
I love you."

489
00:24:58,345 --> 00:25:00,611
Papa loves us, Maya.

490
00:25:01,347 --> 00:25:03,747
Then why doesn't he live with us?

491
00:25:03,749 --> 00:25:06,750
Why does he only come on Sundays?

492
00:25:06,752 --> 00:25:09,352
Well, he's very busy all week.

493
00:25:09,354 --> 00:25:11,354
Everyone wants his paintings,

494
00:25:11,356 --> 00:25:14,023
so he has to work terribly hard.

495
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:17,625
He's doing it for us.

496
00:25:18,961 --> 00:25:21,161
To earn money for us.

497
00:25:22,831 --> 00:25:26,666
Picasso had met Marie-therese
when she was 17 years old.

498
00:25:26,668 --> 00:25:29,101
She was so simple that
she'd never even heard of him.

499
00:25:29,103 --> 00:25:32,237
He had to show her his
photograph in a popular magazine

500
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:34,239
to prove to her that he was famous.

501
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:35,707
His paintings of Marie-therese

502
00:25:35,709 --> 00:25:37,608
are all about making love.

503
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:40,544
They are full of
sensuality, of sexuality.

504
00:25:40,546 --> 00:25:42,646
But I suppose she wasn't very intelligent

505
00:25:42,648 --> 00:25:44,047
and he got bored with her.

506
00:25:44,049 --> 00:25:47,016
And that was when
dora maar entered his life.

507
00:25:48,185 --> 00:25:51,519
His early portraits of dora
were as tender and lyrical

508
00:25:51,521 --> 00:25:54,388
as those of Marie-therese
when he first loved her,

509
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:56,056
though in much stronger colors,

510
00:25:56,058 --> 00:25:58,691
black hair glistening
with blues and Greens

511
00:25:58,693 --> 00:26:01,593
to express dora's
much stronger character.

512
00:26:01,595 --> 00:26:04,963
But within a few years, he had
tortured dora out of shape

513
00:26:04,965 --> 00:26:07,065
and turned her into the weeping woman

514
00:26:07,067 --> 00:26:09,734
with bulging eyes and swollen nostrils

515
00:26:09,736 --> 00:26:12,470
and lashes that had become teardrops.

516
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:21,611
She lived around the corner from him,

517
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:24,747
and he showed up at her studio
whenever it suited him.

518
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:27,883
So she spent her days
and nights waiting for him.

519
00:26:27,885 --> 00:26:30,086
She was psychologically his prisoner,

520
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:32,755
and once he actually
painted her behind bars

521
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:35,390
with a crust of bread and a jug of water.

522
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:37,091
That picture no longer exists.

523
00:26:37,093 --> 00:26:38,792
He painted over it.

524
00:26:38,794 --> 00:26:40,460
But her misery remained.

525
00:26:40,462 --> 00:26:42,128
More insects for you.

526
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:45,597
This is how you wake up
one morning, like kafka.

527
00:26:46,866 --> 00:26:48,665
What has happened to you?

528
00:26:48,667 --> 00:26:50,066
I was attacked.

529
00:26:50,068 --> 00:26:52,201
A man attacked me and stole my bicycle.

530
00:26:52,203 --> 00:26:53,202
When was this?

531
00:26:53,204 --> 00:26:54,403
Just now.

532
00:26:54,405 --> 00:26:56,405
He attacked me and stole my bicycle.

533
00:26:56,407 --> 00:26:57,606
We must inform the police.

534
00:26:57,608 --> 00:26:58,840
I told them,

535
00:26:58,842 --> 00:27:01,075
but they said the assailant is within.

536
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:02,276
He's you.

537
00:27:02,278 --> 00:27:03,277
You're my assailant.

538
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:04,278
Pull yourself together.

539
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,312
You may be a great painter,

540
00:27:05,314 --> 00:27:06,279
but morally you're worthless.

541
00:27:06,281 --> 00:27:07,480
You live an evil life.

542
00:27:07,482 --> 00:27:08,581
You have contaminated the whole world.

543
00:27:08,583 --> 00:27:09,682
That's exactly what my critics say.

544
00:27:09,684 --> 00:27:11,316
Who have you been reading?

545
00:27:11,318 --> 00:27:12,550
I'm thinking of you and your salvation.
You have to be saved.

546
00:27:12,552 --> 00:27:13,350
Well, you save me.

547
00:27:13,352 --> 00:27:14,617
No, don't you see?

548
00:27:14,619 --> 00:27:16,652
I can't. Corruption
is eating me up, too.

549
00:27:16,654 --> 00:27:18,220
I'm like a rotted tooth in your mouth.

550
00:27:18,222 --> 00:27:19,221
It's not your fault.

551
00:27:19,223 --> 00:27:20,222
It's not my fault...

552
00:27:20,224 --> 00:27:21,323
it's God's fault. No!

553
00:27:21,325 --> 00:27:23,291
Ask to be forgiven. We
must pray together.

554
00:27:23,293 --> 00:27:24,325
If we don't pray,

555
00:27:24,327 --> 00:27:25,759
we are doomed, doomed together.

556
00:27:25,761 --> 00:27:29,095
Don't you understand? We
are one soul before God.

557
00:27:29,097 --> 00:27:29,962
Pray together.

558
00:27:29,964 --> 00:27:32,097
One soul, and we'll be redeemed.

559
00:27:32,099 --> 00:27:33,098
Slow, slow, slow.

560
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,633
Slow down!

561
00:27:40,105 --> 00:27:43,239
Just calm down.

562
00:27:43,241 --> 00:27:44,640
Calm.

563
00:27:44,642 --> 00:27:46,041
There.

564
00:27:47,911 --> 00:27:49,310
We'll go see Dr. Lacan.

565
00:27:49,312 --> 00:27:51,178
Don't make me leave you!

566
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:54,314
No, I'll take you.
Of course I will.

567
00:27:54,316 --> 00:27:58,317
I'll take you. You just need
some rest, that's all?

568
00:28:00,688 --> 00:28:01,953
Not without you.

569
00:28:01,955 --> 00:28:04,422
No, no, no, I'm going with you.

570
00:28:04,424 --> 00:28:06,657
I'm going with you.

571
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,725
Dora's weak.

572
00:28:08,727 --> 00:28:09,959
She cracked under the strain.

573
00:28:09,961 --> 00:28:11,627
Under the strain of you.

574
00:28:11,629 --> 00:28:12,995
You should be helping her,

575
00:28:12,997 --> 00:28:14,529
not hurting her more.

576
00:28:14,531 --> 00:28:15,897
It's only human not to peck

577
00:28:15,899 --> 00:28:17,265
a weaker person to death.

578
00:28:17,267 --> 00:28:19,133
No. What is human is to
be strong and survive.

579
00:28:19,135 --> 00:28:20,934
The rest is sentimental rubbish.

580
00:28:20,936 --> 00:28:23,403
Anyway, there's nothing
between dora and me anymore.

581
00:28:23,405 --> 00:28:25,938
She'll tell you herself.

582
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,372
Come on. It's not much further.

583
00:28:27,374 --> 00:28:28,373
I don't want to go.

584
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:30,308
She's expecting us.

585
00:28:31,244 --> 00:28:32,943
I thought you felt
so terribly sorry for her.

586
00:28:32,945 --> 00:28:34,911
Exactly. That's why
I don't want to go.

587
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:38,814
My God, what's the matter with you?

588
00:28:38,816 --> 00:28:39,815
I'm doing this for you,

589
00:28:39,817 --> 00:28:40,816
don't you understand?

590
00:28:40,818 --> 00:28:42,250
I'm a man of deep feelings.

591
00:28:42,252 --> 00:28:44,619
You have no feelings. You
know nothing about love.

592
00:28:44,621 --> 00:28:45,853
You're as cold as a fish.

593
00:28:45,855 --> 00:28:48,288
I'll throw you in
the sea and warm you up.

594
00:28:50,858 --> 00:28:51,890
What's the matter with you?

595
00:28:51,892 --> 00:28:53,725
An exaggerated sense of humor.

596
00:28:53,727 --> 00:28:55,393
"I don't want to go."

597
00:28:58,564 --> 00:28:59,829
Come. "I don't want to go."

598
00:28:59,831 --> 00:29:01,511
"I don't want to go."
"I don't want to go."

599
00:29:08,405 --> 00:29:09,670
The tension between negative

600
00:29:09,672 --> 00:29:12,472
and positive shapes is...

601
00:29:12,474 --> 00:29:14,574
Very strong.

602
00:29:14,576 --> 00:29:16,642
She's intelligent, isn't she?

603
00:29:16,644 --> 00:29:18,510
I really like intelligent women.

604
00:29:18,512 --> 00:29:19,611
Sometimes.

605
00:29:19,613 --> 00:29:21,446
Of course, I like stupid ones, too.

606
00:29:25,185 --> 00:29:26,884
I take it you've come for something other

607
00:29:26,886 --> 00:29:28,452
than to study my paintings.

608
00:29:28,454 --> 00:29:29,820
That's right. The point is,

609
00:29:29,822 --> 00:29:30,987
I'm trying to make francoise
come and live with me,

610
00:29:30,989 --> 00:29:32,509
but she says she won't because of you.

611
00:29:36,859 --> 00:29:38,725
What do I have to do with it?

612
00:29:39,461 --> 00:29:40,726
Exactly.

613
00:29:41,729 --> 00:29:42,761
You heard it yourself.

614
00:29:42,763 --> 00:29:44,028
She has nothing to do with it.

615
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:46,230
Because there is nothing
between her and me.

616
00:29:46,232 --> 00:29:47,864
Tell her.

617
00:29:48,733 --> 00:29:51,733
No, absolutely nothing.

618
00:29:53,603 --> 00:29:54,868
Then that's settled.

619
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:57,437
Everyone knows where they stand.

620
00:29:57,439 --> 00:29:58,805
Yes.

621
00:29:58,807 --> 00:30:01,808
Everyone always knows where
they stand with you.

622
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:05,011
She's not going to last
15 minutes with you.

623
00:30:05,013 --> 00:30:07,713
Perhaps she thinks
you'll immortalize her.

624
00:30:07,715 --> 00:30:09,214
Don't raise her hopes.

625
00:30:09,216 --> 00:30:11,583
Picassos may turn out
to be no more immortal

626
00:30:11,585 --> 00:30:15,986
than the skeleton of some
extinct bird of prey.

627
00:30:18,657 --> 00:30:20,256
Come and have dinner with us.

628
00:30:20,258 --> 00:30:22,191
You should be glad that
I'm in a good mood again

629
00:30:22,193 --> 00:30:23,158
and in love.

630
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,193
You've never loved anyone in your life.

631
00:30:25,195 --> 00:30:26,561
Psst!

632
00:30:26,563 --> 00:30:28,195
You even hate yourself.

633
00:30:28,197 --> 00:30:30,163
Dora is quite a psychologist, you know.

634
00:30:30,165 --> 00:30:31,497
Come on, I'll take you to lipp

635
00:30:31,499 --> 00:30:34,166
and feed you Sauerkraut.

636
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:53,050
So, where are you going this summer?

637
00:30:53,052 --> 00:30:55,052
If you're not going to
menerbes, we might.

638
00:30:55,054 --> 00:30:56,253
You'll like menerbes.

639
00:30:56,255 --> 00:30:57,354
It's on a cliff.

640
00:30:57,356 --> 00:30:59,923
It belonged to one of
Napoleon's generals.

641
00:30:59,925 --> 00:31:01,457
It belongs to me.

642
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:02,524
That's right.

643
00:31:02,526 --> 00:31:04,058
I gave it to dora.

644
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,592
The owner wanted a painting of mine,

645
00:31:05,594 --> 00:31:07,193
so we made an exchange.

646
00:31:07,195 --> 00:31:08,694
His house for my painting.

647
00:31:08,696 --> 00:31:11,229
The owner's wife was
killed in a car crash.

648
00:31:11,231 --> 00:31:13,431
That's why he couldn't
bear the place anymore.

649
00:31:13,433 --> 00:31:15,633
I think it's haunted
by that poor dead woman.

650
00:31:15,635 --> 00:31:18,068
Don't say these things.

651
00:31:19,037 --> 00:31:20,436
Anyway, if you're not
going there this summer,

652
00:31:20,438 --> 00:31:22,871
we might. Francoise and I.

653
00:31:22,873 --> 00:31:24,706
But if it's dora's house, then I...

654
00:31:24,708 --> 00:31:26,674
it's a present.
I gave it to her.

655
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:28,208
Tell her, dora.

656
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:30,343
Yes, it's my house which he gave to me,

657
00:31:30,345 --> 00:31:31,410
as his present to me.

658
00:31:31,412 --> 00:31:34,045
It's full of scorpions
as you'll find out.

659
00:31:34,047 --> 00:31:35,546
Shake out your shoes in the morning

660
00:31:35,548 --> 00:31:36,813
before putting them on.

661
00:31:37,816 --> 00:31:38,915
Little scorpions...

662
00:31:38,917 --> 00:31:41,050
Zzzz. Ch ch ch.

663
00:32:02,835 --> 00:32:04,601
Look at that, look!

664
00:32:04,603 --> 00:32:06,803
I love wild cats.

665
00:32:06,805 --> 00:32:10,172
They're always pregnant because
they think of nothing but love.

666
00:32:12,276 --> 00:32:15,377
All these cats
ever get to eat is lizards.

667
00:32:15,379 --> 00:32:18,113
Then the lizards eat them from inside.

668
00:32:18,115 --> 00:32:21,216
That's why they are so thin.

669
00:32:26,422 --> 00:32:27,421
Francoise!

670
00:32:27,423 --> 00:32:30,090
Francoise, look!

671
00:32:30,092 --> 00:32:31,224
Watch!

672
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,563
Look, look, look!

673
00:33:47,494 --> 00:33:50,027
That was the sort of scene he loved:

674
00:33:50,029 --> 00:33:53,030
Only men with scarcely a woman in sight.

675
00:33:53,032 --> 00:33:55,232
It was the only bastille day
I had ever seen

676
00:33:55,234 --> 00:33:56,933
where there was no dancing at all.

677
00:33:56,935 --> 00:33:59,135
"Thank God for that," Picasso said.

678
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:00,803
He hated dancing.

679
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:02,771
To sleep with as many women as possible,

680
00:34:02,773 --> 00:34:04,039
that was fine.

681
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:05,974
But to dance with them...

682
00:34:05,976 --> 00:34:07,642
That was immoral.

683
00:34:13,716 --> 00:34:14,781
Thank you.

684
00:34:25,026 --> 00:34:26,392
From grandma?

685
00:34:28,295 --> 00:34:29,727
What does she want?

686
00:34:40,304 --> 00:34:42,237
From Marie-therese, I suppose?

687
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,972
Yeah, she's so sweet,

688
00:34:43,974 --> 00:34:45,707
writing to me every day.

689
00:34:46,676 --> 00:34:50,144
"There's only one you, my
wonderful, terrible lover.

690
00:34:50,146 --> 00:34:53,847
"No one else in the entire
world, not even Maya.

691
00:34:53,849 --> 00:34:57,584
I live for you
with every breath."

692
00:34:57,586 --> 00:34:59,152
You would never write to me like that.

693
00:34:59,988 --> 00:35:01,320
No, I wouldn't.

694
00:35:01,322 --> 00:35:03,055
Marie-therese really loves me.

695
00:35:03,057 --> 00:35:05,389
She's a real woman.

696
00:35:06,658 --> 00:35:07,723
Look above you.

697
00:36:08,084 --> 00:36:10,984
Hey! What are you doing?

698
00:36:10,986 --> 00:36:12,585
I'm hitchhiking to marseilles,

699
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,587
and from there I'm going to Algeria.

700
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,121
Algeria.

701
00:36:16,123 --> 00:36:17,222
Another madwoman.

702
00:36:17,224 --> 00:36:18,990
Get in the car!

703
00:36:18,992 --> 00:36:20,257
No, I've made up my mind.

704
00:36:20,259 --> 00:36:21,258
Get in the car!

705
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:24,461
Hey, get in the car! Come on!

706
00:36:24,463 --> 00:36:25,528
Stop!

707
00:36:26,864 --> 00:36:27,863
Stop!

708
00:36:27,865 --> 00:36:29,130
Francoise!

709
00:36:29,132 --> 00:36:30,197
Francoise!

710
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:31,765
I'm not going back to that house.

711
00:36:31,767 --> 00:36:32,766
Come here!

712
00:36:32,768 --> 00:36:34,000
Come back!

713
00:36:34,002 --> 00:36:35,134
Francoise!

714
00:36:35,136 --> 00:36:37,202
I am not going back to that house.

715
00:36:37,204 --> 00:36:39,337
Wh-what's wrong?

716
00:36:39,339 --> 00:36:40,338
You can't do this to...

717
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,339
you can't, mademoiselle.

718
00:36:41,341 --> 00:36:42,707
Monsieur needs you.

719
00:36:42,709 --> 00:36:43,741
L-let me go!

720
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:44,742
Get into the car!

721
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:45,743
Let me go!

722
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:46,744
Get into the car!

723
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:47,811
Let me go!

724
00:37:15,506 --> 00:37:18,206
I wish I could wrap you
up in one of those tents

725
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:20,942
that Muslim women wear.

726
00:37:20,944 --> 00:37:24,512
In Spain we believe that the
eye is like a sexual organ

727
00:37:24,514 --> 00:37:27,915
and looking at a woman can be rape.

728
00:37:27,917 --> 00:37:30,751
Rape with the eye.

729
00:37:34,456 --> 00:37:37,123
I want you to swear

730
00:37:37,125 --> 00:37:39,058
that you will love me forever.

731
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:41,460
Swear before God.

732
00:37:41,462 --> 00:37:43,061
But you don't believe in God.

733
00:37:43,063 --> 00:37:44,595
Not in here.

734
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:53,135
Kneel.

735
00:37:53,137 --> 00:37:54,970
Come on, kneel.

736
00:37:54,972 --> 00:37:56,471
Kneel down.

737
00:37:58,608 --> 00:37:59,540
Now, say it,

738
00:37:59,542 --> 00:38:04,044
"I, francoise, swear to love Picasso

739
00:38:04,046 --> 00:38:06,112
"and only Picasso

740
00:38:06,114 --> 00:38:08,080
"forever and ever.

741
00:38:08,082 --> 00:38:09,815
Amen."

742
00:38:09,817 --> 00:38:14,286
"I, francoise, swear to love Picasso

743
00:38:14,288 --> 00:38:16,154
"and only Picasso

744
00:38:16,156 --> 00:38:18,789
"forever and ever.

745
00:38:18,791 --> 00:38:19,589
Amen."

746
00:38:19,591 --> 00:38:20,723
Good, now you've sworn it.

747
00:38:20,725 --> 00:38:21,890
You can never run away from me again.

748
00:38:21,892 --> 00:38:23,024
Now, you swear, you swear.

749
00:38:23,026 --> 00:38:25,126
Why did you run away?

750
00:38:25,128 --> 00:38:26,560
Aren't you happy with me?

751
00:38:26,562 --> 00:38:27,961
You can't pretend to be

752
00:38:27,963 --> 00:38:30,563
the easiest person in the
world to get along with.

753
00:38:31,332 --> 00:38:33,165
I'm a perfectly straightforward character

754
00:38:33,167 --> 00:38:34,599
with all my cards on the table.

755
00:38:34,601 --> 00:38:35,967
But there are so many cards,

756
00:38:35,969 --> 00:38:37,969
and some of them are
under the table, too.

757
00:38:37,971 --> 00:38:40,504
And then suddenly they pop
up like Marie-therese,

758
00:38:40,506 --> 00:38:43,106
and now who knows who
else is going to appear.

759
00:38:43,108 --> 00:38:44,740
You think too much up here.

760
00:38:44,742 --> 00:38:45,941
You shouldn't think up there,

761
00:38:45,943 --> 00:38:48,810
you should feel down there.

762
00:38:48,812 --> 00:38:49,610
You should have a child.

763
00:38:49,612 --> 00:38:50,612
You should have my child,

764
00:38:50,613 --> 00:38:52,045
then you'd learn how to feel.

765
00:38:52,047 --> 00:38:53,980
You'd be a real woman.

766
00:38:53,982 --> 00:38:56,048
You'd be my woman.

767
00:39:18,571 --> 00:39:21,204
The exhibition's on the fourth.

768
00:39:21,206 --> 00:39:23,072
I have to have my answer today.

769
00:39:23,074 --> 00:39:24,273
I must tell my printer.

770
00:39:24,275 --> 00:39:25,540
Who knows what this day will bring

771
00:39:25,542 --> 00:39:28,209
before the sun will set on it?

772
00:39:28,211 --> 00:39:29,710
I've been here every day this week,

773
00:39:29,712 --> 00:39:31,812
and every day I hear the same thing.

774
00:39:31,814 --> 00:39:33,446
Well, perhaps tomorrow will be different.

775
00:39:33,448 --> 00:39:35,347
Where there is life, there's
always hope, my friend.

776
00:39:35,349 --> 00:39:36,349
Hope is green and eternal.

777
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:37,382
Look, look, look,

778
00:39:37,384 --> 00:39:38,516
I'm neither green nor eternal.

779
00:39:38,518 --> 00:39:39,750
I-I don't know about
everybody else,

780
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:41,118
but I must get back to New York.

781
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,120
I have a business to run.

782
00:39:42,121 --> 00:39:43,253
And so have I.

783
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:44,954
My business is called Picasso.

784
00:39:44,956 --> 00:39:47,356
I have to see him today.

785
00:39:47,358 --> 00:39:48,790
It's imperative.

786
00:39:48,792 --> 00:39:49,590
Imperative?

787
00:39:49,592 --> 00:39:51,491
Imperative, that's right.

788
00:39:51,493 --> 00:39:55,027
Why don't you try and get up?

789
00:39:57,097 --> 00:39:58,563
No, no, don't.

790
00:39:58,565 --> 00:39:59,363
Try!

791
00:39:59,365 --> 00:40:00,630
Don't torture me! Go away.

792
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:02,931
I can't stand it, I can't
stand it any longer.

793
00:40:02,933 --> 00:40:04,432
Of course not, without
your coffee and brioche.

794
00:40:04,434 --> 00:40:05,566
What were you thinking of?

795
00:40:05,568 --> 00:40:07,000
The man has to eat.
Yes, he's human.

796
00:40:07,002 --> 00:40:08,201
Don't put it on the bed.

797
00:40:08,203 --> 00:40:10,369
I'm... I'm going away, I must.

798
00:40:10,371 --> 00:40:11,503
There's no other way out.

799
00:40:11,505 --> 00:40:12,504
No, you'll feel better in a minute.

800
00:40:12,506 --> 00:40:15,707
I can't stand it any longer.

801
00:40:15,709 --> 00:40:18,342
You know this is no life.

802
00:40:18,344 --> 00:40:20,477
What am I doing here?

803
00:40:20,479 --> 00:40:22,879
You know very well
I'm not doing anything.

804
00:40:22,881 --> 00:40:25,781
Every day I work worse
than the day before.

805
00:40:25,783 --> 00:40:27,783
And today you'll do something you like.

806
00:40:27,785 --> 00:40:29,551
Just get up and start
work and you'll see.

807
00:40:29,553 --> 00:40:31,686
We've lit the stove.
The studio's all warm.

808
00:40:31,688 --> 00:40:35,222
What makes you think today will
be any better than yesterday?

809
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:37,123
But yesterday was wonderful.

810
00:40:37,125 --> 00:40:40,226
You finished your whole
series on the Pont Neuf.

811
00:40:40,228 --> 00:40:42,394
Yeah, but is it any good?

812
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:44,529
Go and see for yourself.

813
00:40:44,531 --> 00:40:46,531
No. It would only depress me.

814
00:40:46,533 --> 00:40:47,999
But it's wonderful!

815
00:40:48,001 --> 00:40:51,435
Kootz says he has to see you today.
It's imperative.

816
00:40:51,437 --> 00:40:54,438
He said it was imperative yesterday.

817
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,006
He said it was imperative the day before.

818
00:40:56,008 --> 00:40:56,973
He's making my life hell.

819
00:40:56,975 --> 00:40:58,174
He says he has to get back to America,

820
00:40:58,176 --> 00:40:59,708
and kahnweiler is there, too.

821
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:02,277
They're sitting side
by side in the salon.

822
00:41:02,279 --> 00:41:03,544
But they loathe each other.

823
00:41:07,016 --> 00:41:08,015
Well, you go and tell them.

824
00:41:08,017 --> 00:41:09,149
Tell them what?

825
00:41:09,151 --> 00:41:10,283
I don't know.

826
00:41:10,285 --> 00:41:12,285
Tell them Picasso has a stomachache.

827
00:41:12,287 --> 00:41:14,420
Well, it's true, I have a stomachache.

828
00:41:14,422 --> 00:41:15,687
Every time I inform my doctor,

829
00:41:15,689 --> 00:41:17,555
he just shows me his grandson's drawings.

830
00:41:17,557 --> 00:41:20,424
If you get up, you'd feel better.

831
00:41:20,426 --> 00:41:21,958
Why don't you try?

832
00:41:23,795 --> 00:41:25,861
I hate it when people try to bully me.

833
00:41:25,863 --> 00:41:28,463
It's particularly ugly
in a woman, francoise.

834
00:41:32,734 --> 00:41:33,734
Hey!

835
00:41:34,535 --> 00:41:35,534
Good morning.

836
00:41:35,536 --> 00:41:36,535
Good afternoon.

837
00:41:36,537 --> 00:41:37,536
Want a light?

838
00:41:37,538 --> 00:41:38,537
<i>Por favor.</i>

839
00:41:38,539 --> 00:41:39,905
Don't you have any matches?

840
00:41:39,907 --> 00:41:41,773
No.

841
00:41:41,775 --> 00:41:42,974
Sorry to keep you waiting.

842
00:41:42,976 --> 00:41:44,108
Monsieur.

843
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:46,043
How do you do?

844
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:47,277
<i>Bonjour, maitre.</i>

845
00:41:47,279 --> 00:41:48,811
<i>Señor.</i> Hello.

846
00:41:48,813 --> 00:41:50,579
<i>Buon giorno.</i> I'm honored.

847
00:41:50,581 --> 00:41:52,047
Jean-Claude, are you
here again today?

848
00:41:52,049 --> 00:41:53,048
Madame.

849
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:54,449
Hello. Monsieur.

850
00:41:54,451 --> 00:41:56,050
Pablo. Monsieur.

851
00:41:56,052 --> 00:41:57,551
Madame, hello.

852
00:41:57,553 --> 00:41:58,552
Kootz, what are you doing here?

853
00:41:58,554 --> 00:41:59,653
No one told me.

854
00:41:59,655 --> 00:42:00,854
Why didn't you tell me he was here?

855
00:42:00,856 --> 00:42:03,590
Francoise, keeping
Mr. Kootz waiting.

856
00:42:03,592 --> 00:42:04,924
Come with me. I have
something to show you.

857
00:42:04,926 --> 00:42:05,925
Good. Finally.

858
00:42:05,927 --> 00:42:07,159
I'll be back.

859
00:42:07,161 --> 00:42:09,728
Of course he didn't even see me.

860
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:12,163
Mr. Kootz has come all
the way from New York.

861
00:42:12,165 --> 00:42:16,667
The only reason kootz is
in Paris is to buy picassos.

862
00:42:16,669 --> 00:42:18,935
He goes nowhere else, sees no one else.

863
00:42:18,937 --> 00:42:21,003
He doesn't even go to the louvre.

864
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:25,273
He says it isn't abstract enough for him.

865
00:42:25,275 --> 00:42:26,841
Do you,

866
00:42:26,843 --> 00:42:28,576
do you think Picasso
will sell him something?

867
00:42:28,578 --> 00:42:30,511
What? What will he sell him?
What has he got?

868
00:42:30,513 --> 00:42:32,646
I'm sure he'll show you very soon.

869
00:42:51,931 --> 00:42:55,365
Now, in New York I can sell
everything that you give me

870
00:42:55,367 --> 00:42:56,632
in 5 minutes. Just like that.

871
00:42:56,634 --> 00:42:57,633
How much?

872
00:42:57,635 --> 00:42:59,134
For.

873
00:42:59,136 --> 00:43:01,269
For more than any painter alive today.

874
00:43:01,271 --> 00:43:02,937
More than Matisse?

875
00:43:05,608 --> 00:43:07,274
More, more.

876
00:43:08,577 --> 00:43:10,543
This is too...
this is wonderful.

877
00:43:10,545 --> 00:43:12,645
You still have this?

878
00:43:12,647 --> 00:43:13,646
It's a braque.

879
00:43:13,648 --> 00:43:16,615
I've had it for 30 years.

880
00:43:18,752 --> 00:43:22,153
Well, m-Matisse has sent
a lot of new work,

881
00:43:22,155 --> 00:43:23,487
but I keep telling them in New York,

882
00:43:23,489 --> 00:43:25,489
"wait till you see the new picassos,

883
00:43:25,491 --> 00:43:26,857
wait till you see
the new picassos."

884
00:43:26,859 --> 00:43:29,292
I've got them all steamed up.

885
00:43:29,294 --> 00:43:31,494
So, all this, all this is new?

886
00:43:31,496 --> 00:43:32,827
Well.

887
00:43:40,902 --> 00:43:42,901
How many were you thinking of?

888
00:43:44,504 --> 00:43:45,503
9.

889
00:43:45,505 --> 00:43:48,272
He wants 9 pictures.

890
00:43:48,274 --> 00:43:51,375
If wishes were horses,
beggars would ride.

891
00:43:51,377 --> 00:43:54,411
Sabartes loves old proverbs.

892
00:43:54,413 --> 00:43:55,912
He's such an old woman.

893
00:43:57,382 --> 00:43:58,581
9's impossible.

894
00:43:58,583 --> 00:44:01,283
7? I... I can't go home
with less than 6.

895
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:04,585
What about my other dealers?

896
00:44:04,587 --> 00:44:05,586
What about kahnweiler?

897
00:44:05,588 --> 00:44:06,753
Kahnweiler?

898
00:44:06,755 --> 00:44:08,588
Kahnweiler is still
on pre-war prices,

899
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:09,922
pre-world war I prices.

900
00:44:09,924 --> 00:44:16,127
I am here to make a serious offer.

901
00:44:18,865 --> 00:44:20,197
Kahnweiler's my oldest dealer.

902
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:22,499
He bought when no one
else would spit at me.

903
00:44:22,501 --> 00:44:25,635
Yes, but great art can't
be bought with sentiment.

904
00:44:25,637 --> 00:44:29,371
You need something more substantial.

905
00:44:30,574 --> 00:44:31,573
I like your necktie.

906
00:44:31,575 --> 00:44:32,574
Thank you.

907
00:44:32,576 --> 00:44:34,075
Is it American? Yes.

908
00:44:34,077 --> 00:44:36,477
New York? Saks fifth Avenue.

909
00:44:42,383 --> 00:44:44,049
Are you interested?

910
00:44:44,051 --> 00:44:47,185
Am I interested?

911
00:44:47,187 --> 00:44:48,252
I would...

912
00:44:48,254 --> 00:44:51,321
I would have it shipped the moment that,

913
00:44:51,323 --> 00:44:54,423
it was finished.

914
00:44:55,592 --> 00:44:57,725
A painting can never be finished.

915
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:58,992
Well, of... of course,
that's... that's what I meant.

916
00:44:58,994 --> 00:45:00,059
Art is always in process.

917
00:45:00,061 --> 00:45:02,294
I did... I didn't
mean to imply...

918
00:45:03,997 --> 00:45:06,797
To finish a painting means to
destroy it, to rob it of its soul.

919
00:45:06,799 --> 00:45:10,534
To give it the<i> puntilla,</i>
the coup de grace.

920
00:45:10,536 --> 00:45:13,837
No, my friend, the day I finish a
painting, that day I'm finished.

921
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:15,205
I really like that necktie.

922
00:45:15,207 --> 00:45:18,507
Then it would be my
pleasure to give it to you.

923
00:45:21,411 --> 00:45:22,576
Here.

924
00:45:23,712 --> 00:45:25,111
Thank you.

925
00:45:28,548 --> 00:45:31,081
Mr. Kahnweiler,
you're still here.

926
00:45:31,083 --> 00:45:34,684
I'm so sorry. I can't think
what happened today,

927
00:45:34,686 --> 00:45:36,218
why you've been kept waiting so long.

928
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:39,354
Well, it amuses him to think
of me sitting out here,

929
00:45:39,356 --> 00:45:42,290
wondering what he might be
selling to other dealers.

930
00:45:42,292 --> 00:45:44,659
It's been his favorite game with me

931
00:45:44,661 --> 00:45:46,661
for the past 35 years.

932
00:45:46,663 --> 00:45:48,896
OK. See you tomorrow.

933
00:45:48,898 --> 00:45:51,632
Well, I can change the reservation time.

934
00:45:51,634 --> 00:45:53,767
Kahnweiler, what are you doing here?
No one told me you...

935
00:45:53,769 --> 00:45:55,568
why didn't you tell me
Mr. Kahnweiler was here?

936
00:45:55,570 --> 00:45:57,169
He's my old friend.
How are you?

937
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:58,937
Do you like my tie? Kootz gave it to me.
It's from New York.

938
00:45:58,939 --> 00:46:00,238
I think it looks nice on you.

939
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,006
Saks fifth aven... is it saks?
Yes.

940
00:46:02,008 --> 00:46:05,442
How are... why didn't you tell
me he was here, you silly...

941
00:46:05,444 --> 00:46:06,709
so, s... listen...

942
00:46:06,711 --> 00:46:07,976
I'll show you something.

943
00:46:07,978 --> 00:46:09,510
You have a good journey.

944
00:46:09,512 --> 00:46:10,544
Well, thank you...

945
00:46:10,546 --> 00:46:11,578
good. You happy?

946
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:12,979
Well, I hope to be. I...

947
00:46:12,981 --> 00:46:13,980
good.

948
00:46:13,982 --> 00:46:15,047
Bad.

949
00:46:20,587 --> 00:46:21,787
Think he'll sell him anything?

950
00:46:21,788 --> 00:46:23,154
Did he sell you anything?

951
00:46:23,156 --> 00:46:26,056
He told me to come back tomorrow.

952
00:46:26,058 --> 00:46:27,724
Why did you give him your necktie?

953
00:46:27,726 --> 00:46:29,392
He said he liked it.
What could I do?

954
00:46:29,394 --> 00:46:31,627
I've got such a pain right here.
I... have you?

955
00:46:31,629 --> 00:46:33,061
Can change my reservation,

956
00:46:33,063 --> 00:46:35,296
because he told me they were all booked.

957
00:48:26,908 --> 00:48:30,442
Don't you get tired
standing all that time?

958
00:48:30,444 --> 00:48:33,144
You've been working for nearly 9 hours.

959
00:48:33,146 --> 00:48:36,313
While I work, I leave my
body outside the door,

960
00:48:36,315 --> 00:48:38,281
the way muslims take off their shoes

961
00:48:38,283 --> 00:48:40,283
before they enter the mosque.

962
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,727
I love these spotlights.

963
00:48:51,729 --> 00:48:54,462
I even prefer them to natural light.

964
00:48:56,933 --> 00:49:00,667
They set off every object.

965
00:49:00,669 --> 00:49:01,834
There.

966
00:49:01,836 --> 00:49:04,036
You'll find the deep shadows they make

967
00:49:04,038 --> 00:49:05,237
in most of my still lifes,

968
00:49:05,239 --> 00:49:07,572
because they were painted at night.

969
00:49:07,574 --> 00:49:11,208
Painting is stronger than I am.

970
00:49:11,210 --> 00:49:15,612
It makes me do what it wants.

971
00:49:15,614 --> 00:49:17,080
It holds the brush.

972
00:49:17,082 --> 00:49:19,148
It doesn't seem to obey my brain,

973
00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:22,084
but something else over
which I have no control.

974
00:49:25,389 --> 00:49:27,756
Now, look at this.

975
00:49:27,758 --> 00:49:29,691
Obviously, it's a woman.

976
00:49:29,693 --> 00:49:33,227
It's you in your long black dress.

977
00:49:33,229 --> 00:49:35,696
But you seem to be turning into a...

978
00:49:35,698 --> 00:49:39,433
A bouquet of flowers or a lilac bush.

979
00:49:39,435 --> 00:49:42,602
Very mysterious...

980
00:49:42,604 --> 00:49:44,971
I think I've painted one
thing, and it's another.

981
00:49:44,973 --> 00:49:46,372
I've become so fatalistic,

982
00:49:46,374 --> 00:49:48,273
I think, well, if it's
blue, it must be a woman,

983
00:49:48,275 --> 00:49:51,376
if it has a beard, it must be a man.

984
00:49:51,378 --> 00:49:54,512
I make a lot of mistakes,
and so does God.

985
00:49:54,514 --> 00:49:59,583
He makes a dachshund and then an
elephant and a squirrel and a whale.

986
00:49:59,585 --> 00:50:01,051
Like me.

987
00:50:01,053 --> 00:50:03,185
He's tried everything, like me.

988
00:50:05,022 --> 00:50:07,222
We have no style.

989
00:50:07,224 --> 00:50:09,657
Style only comes after you're dead.

990
00:50:09,659 --> 00:50:12,926
There are painters who make
themselves a little cake mold,

991
00:50:12,928 --> 00:50:15,461
and then they bake cakes.

992
00:50:15,463 --> 00:50:17,863
Always the same cakes.

993
00:50:17,865 --> 00:50:20,065
You can try anything in painting,

994
00:50:20,067 --> 00:50:22,167
provided you never do it again.

995
00:50:22,169 --> 00:50:23,735
Don't sell yourself anything.

996
00:50:23,737 --> 00:50:26,003
Don't become your own connoisseur.

997
00:50:44,222 --> 00:50:45,553
Now!

998
00:50:53,462 --> 00:50:55,428
What are you going
to call him? Pablo?

999
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:57,463
Or Paulo, like your other son?
How old is Paulo now?

1000
00:50:57,465 --> 00:51:00,898
Why not Pablo?
Another Pablo Picasso.

1001
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:15,974
Doesn't he look exactly like me?

1002
00:51:15,976 --> 00:51:17,909
An authentic Picasso.

1003
00:51:17,911 --> 00:51:20,645
He certainly has the same hair.

1004
00:51:20,647 --> 00:51:22,046
What ugly flowers.

1005
00:51:22,048 --> 00:51:23,313
Aren't they?

1006
00:51:23,315 --> 00:51:26,249
Prime example of my taste for bad taste.

1007
00:51:26,251 --> 00:51:27,917
I have excellent taste
in women and children.

1008
00:51:27,919 --> 00:51:30,552
Let me see him.

1009
00:51:30,554 --> 00:51:32,353
Hold his head!

1010
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:38,426
Every Thursday and
Sunday, he would disappear.

1011
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:41,061
Those were the days he spent
with his other family,

1012
00:51:41,063 --> 00:51:42,729
Marie-therese and Maya.

1013
00:51:42,731 --> 00:51:45,765
She was the only person
allowed to cut his nails,

1014
00:51:45,767 --> 00:51:46,966
a dangerous procedure,

1015
00:51:46,968 --> 00:51:48,233
because if the parings

1016
00:51:48,235 --> 00:51:49,534
were to fall into the wrong hands,

1017
00:51:49,536 --> 00:51:52,169
they could be used
against him as black magic.

1018
00:51:52,171 --> 00:51:54,004
The same with his hair clippings.

1019
00:51:54,006 --> 00:51:56,473
All of these were kept
and dated carefully,

1020
00:51:56,475 --> 00:51:59,275
just like every scrap he ever drew.

1021
00:52:00,945 --> 00:52:03,111
Do you want me to cut your hair today?

1022
00:52:03,113 --> 00:52:05,213
Is there anything left to cut?

1023
00:52:10,286 --> 00:52:11,918
Yes. Look at this.

1024
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,219
So soft. Beautiful.

1025
00:52:13,221 --> 00:52:14,920
No, it's... look,
do you like this?

1026
00:52:16,056 --> 00:52:17,221
Shall I cut it?
Want to see me bald?

1027
00:52:17,223 --> 00:52:19,256
Give me the scissors. No.

1028
00:52:19,258 --> 00:52:21,524
Come on, give me the scissors.

1029
00:52:25,295 --> 00:52:27,161
Right, hold it there.

1030
00:52:32,634 --> 00:52:34,266
Good.

1031
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:38,202
Finished?

1032
00:52:39,338 --> 00:52:46,809
There, papa's a bald old man now?

1033
00:52:46,811 --> 00:52:49,278
Do you like it?

1034
00:52:52,316 --> 00:52:54,482
Kiss me on the head.
You like it?

1035
00:52:54,484 --> 00:52:55,282
Yes.

1036
00:52:55,284 --> 00:52:56,816
You like it? And another.

1037
00:53:01,021 --> 00:53:02,186
I've had such trouble

1038
00:53:02,188 --> 00:53:04,288
with the electricity bill.

1039
00:53:04,290 --> 00:53:06,323
They say you have to pay it first,

1040
00:53:06,325 --> 00:53:09,225
and then they'll investigate
and give you a refund.

1041
00:53:09,227 --> 00:53:10,693
Come here.

1042
00:53:15,633 --> 00:53:19,835
Maya and I will have to go
shopping for a new coat for her.

1043
00:53:19,837 --> 00:53:21,569
She's growing so fast.

1044
00:53:24,974 --> 00:53:26,373
Money is such a worry for you,

1045
00:53:26,375 --> 00:53:29,376
and Maya and I try not to spend too much.

1046
00:53:33,447 --> 00:53:36,247
Without you and Maya, my life would be...

1047
00:53:36,249 --> 00:53:39,216
A desert waste.

1048
00:53:39,218 --> 00:53:40,450
And from now on,

1049
00:53:40,452 --> 00:53:42,919
I want you to write me twice a day.

1050
00:53:42,921 --> 00:53:44,453
Every day, you understand?

1051
00:53:45,756 --> 00:53:48,456
Twice a day, because I'm sick
if I don't hear from you.

1052
00:53:48,458 --> 00:53:51,792
Really sick.
Miserable and lonely.

1053
00:53:56,431 --> 00:53:58,197
After our son was born

1054
00:53:58,199 --> 00:54:00,132
we spent less and less time in Paris.

1055
00:54:00,134 --> 00:54:02,200
Picasso decided that
children need sea air,

1056
00:54:02,202 --> 00:54:03,834
and as soon as it was spring,

1057
00:54:03,836 --> 00:54:06,503
we went to golfe Juan and stayed
right through the autumn.

1058
00:54:06,505 --> 00:54:08,671
But, of course, wherever Picasso went,

1059
00:54:08,673 --> 00:54:11,240
his assorted families went, too,

1060
00:54:14,345 --> 00:54:17,346
why don't you let me
teach you how to swim?

1061
00:54:17,348 --> 00:54:19,681
I swim very well up to my knees.

1062
00:54:19,683 --> 00:54:21,816
I can make love underwater, remember?

1063
00:54:21,818 --> 00:54:23,017
Are you cold?

1064
00:54:23,019 --> 00:54:24,685
Yes, I'm freezing.

1065
00:54:29,591 --> 00:54:31,557
You know what I think would be nice?

1066
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:32,891
What?

1067
00:54:32,893 --> 00:54:35,827
If you would let Marie-therese
and Maya come and visit us.

1068
00:54:35,829 --> 00:54:37,395
Why?

1069
00:54:37,397 --> 00:54:41,298
Why not? Give me
one good reason.

1070
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:43,199
You don't understand
these things yourself.

1071
00:54:43,201 --> 00:54:45,701
I understand that
Claude has a half-sister,

1072
00:54:45,703 --> 00:54:48,036
and I would like him to meet her.

1073
00:54:48,038 --> 00:54:49,537
For a middle-class girl,

1074
00:54:49,539 --> 00:54:51,639
you have very little sense of propriety.

1075
00:54:51,641 --> 00:54:53,774
You were very badly brought up.

1076
00:54:54,777 --> 00:54:56,710
Very badly. Go away.

1077
00:55:02,450 --> 00:55:04,183
Claude was saying whole sentences

1078
00:55:04,185 --> 00:55:06,018
by the time he was 18 months.

1079
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:07,019
Yeah.

1080
00:55:07,021 --> 00:55:08,754
When did he start walking?

1081
00:55:08,756 --> 00:55:10,122
He must've been...

1082
00:55:10,124 --> 00:55:11,656
3 days.

1083
00:55:11,658 --> 00:55:12,723
15 months.

1084
00:55:12,725 --> 00:55:13,757
I shouldn't.

1085
00:55:13,759 --> 00:55:15,859
Maya walked before she was a year old.

1086
00:55:15,861 --> 00:55:18,528
Girls are usually quicker than boys.

1087
00:55:18,530 --> 00:55:20,563
But I didn't wean her till 14 months.

1088
00:55:20,565 --> 00:55:23,132
I started Claude on
solid food at 4 months.

1089
00:55:23,134 --> 00:55:24,867
4 months? Imagine.

1090
00:55:24,869 --> 00:55:27,169
He did very well with bananas and cereal.

1091
00:55:27,171 --> 00:55:28,670
And beef steaks.

1092
00:55:28,672 --> 00:55:29,937
Beef steaks?

1093
00:55:29,939 --> 00:55:31,238
Before he had teeth?

1094
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:33,240
He was born with teeth.

1095
00:55:33,242 --> 00:55:35,709
Strong teeth, like mine.

1096
00:55:35,711 --> 00:55:39,045
I used to mash the yolk of
an egg for him in milk.

1097
00:55:42,049 --> 00:55:44,949
You haven't finished your tea.
It will get cold.

1098
00:55:46,285 --> 00:55:47,884
Thank you.

1099
00:55:59,831 --> 00:56:01,897
Don't hope that you can
ever take my place.

1100
00:56:01,899 --> 00:56:03,498
Of course not.

1101
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:05,766
Others have tried and failed.

1102
00:56:05,768 --> 00:56:09,803
I shall always be the first
and most important with him.

1103
00:56:15,043 --> 00:56:16,942
That is all I wanted to say.

1104
00:56:18,812 --> 00:56:21,245
He was very
disappointed with this meeting.

1105
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:23,547
"You're not a real woman," he accused me.

1106
00:56:23,549 --> 00:56:26,483
A real woman would have fought
over him, physically fought,

1107
00:56:26,485 --> 00:56:28,650
like dora maar did
with Marie-therese.

1108
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:33,453
It happened while
he was painting<i> guernica,</i>

1109
00:56:33,455 --> 00:56:36,055
that great human cry against aggression

1110
00:56:36,057 --> 00:56:37,956
and hate between man and man...

1111
00:56:37,958 --> 00:56:39,790
And woman and woman.

1112
00:56:41,927 --> 00:56:44,160
This man is the father of my child.

1113
00:56:44,162 --> 00:56:46,262
You have no right to be here.

1114
00:56:46,264 --> 00:56:47,830
It's true I haven't got a child,

1115
00:56:47,832 --> 00:56:50,866
but I think he finds me
equally, if not more amusing,

1116
00:56:50,868 --> 00:56:54,469
without one.

1117
00:56:54,471 --> 00:56:55,470
Make up your mind.

1118
00:56:55,472 --> 00:56:57,371
Which one of us do you want?

1119
00:56:57,373 --> 00:57:01,407
I like you both. I have
no complaints at all.

1120
00:57:01,409 --> 00:57:04,076
You must fight it out between yourselves.

1121
00:57:55,256 --> 00:57:57,089
And this.

1122
00:57:57,091 --> 00:57:58,590
And this.

1123
00:58:17,510 --> 00:58:21,410
Hey!

1124
00:58:21,412 --> 00:58:23,311
Garbageman!

1125
00:58:23,313 --> 00:58:24,945
Don't look at her.

1126
00:58:24,947 --> 00:58:25,946
Who's that?

1127
00:58:25,948 --> 00:58:27,113
Completely crazy.

1128
00:58:27,115 --> 00:58:29,849
When I was married to you,
you were an artist.

1129
00:58:29,851 --> 00:58:33,852
What are you doing now?
Collecting garbage.!

1130
00:58:33,854 --> 00:58:34,919
Who is that?

1131
00:58:34,921 --> 00:58:36,987
A garbageman.
Artist to garbageman.

1132
00:58:36,989 --> 00:58:38,421
Olga my wife.

1133
00:58:38,423 --> 00:58:39,655
That's Olga?

1134
00:58:39,657 --> 00:58:43,125
They call you "king
of the rubbish dump."

1135
00:58:43,127 --> 00:58:44,926
King of the rubbish dump.

1136
00:58:44,928 --> 00:58:47,395
That's the only kind of king you are.

1137
00:58:47,397 --> 00:58:51,665
Who is this one he has got with him?

1138
00:58:55,136 --> 00:58:58,237
Who is she?

1139
00:58:58,239 --> 00:59:01,506
Where did he find her?

1140
00:59:01,508 --> 00:59:02,507
Go away. Go home.

1141
00:59:02,509 --> 00:59:04,675
I'm his wife.

1142
00:59:06,979 --> 00:59:08,778
His wife.

1143
00:59:09,747 --> 00:59:13,215
I am the only madame Picasso.

1144
00:59:13,217 --> 00:59:14,482
Where's your son?

1145
00:59:14,484 --> 00:59:15,749
My son? Yeah.

1146
00:59:15,751 --> 00:59:19,220
He's your son.
Every bit of him.

1147
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:21,355
He does no work,

1148
00:59:21,357 --> 00:59:23,190
he spends all of my money,

1149
00:59:23,192 --> 00:59:25,192
and then he asks for more.

1150
00:59:25,194 --> 00:59:27,861
He's going from bad to worse, like you.

1151
00:59:27,863 --> 00:59:31,531
Nothing but drink and girls,

1152
00:59:31,533 --> 00:59:32,899
exactly like his father.

1153
00:59:32,901 --> 00:59:34,600
I don't drink.

1154
00:59:34,602 --> 00:59:37,102
Have you heard of Rembrandt?

1155
00:59:37,104 --> 00:59:38,269
Francoise?

1156
00:59:39,639 --> 00:59:41,338
Have<i> you...</i>

1157
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:44,107
Heard of Rembrandt?

1158
00:59:44,109 --> 00:59:48,277
If you were like him,
you would be a real painter.

1159
00:59:48,279 --> 00:59:50,078
Have you heard of Beethoven?

1160
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:52,080
He is a great genius.

1161
00:59:52,082 --> 00:59:55,516
You, you are nothing.
Nobody. Garbage.

1162
00:59:55,518 --> 00:59:59,052
That goes very well with your trousers.

1163
00:59:59,054 --> 01:00:01,187
I eat caviar...

1164
01:00:04,525 --> 01:00:07,325
Picasso had met Olga in 1917.

1165
01:00:07,327 --> 01:00:09,794
She was with diaghilev's <i>ballet russe.</i>

1166
01:00:09,796 --> 01:00:11,662
Diaghilev chose his dancers

1167
01:00:11,664 --> 01:00:13,263
either because they were good dancers,

1168
01:00:13,265 --> 01:00:15,398
or because they had
good social connections

1169
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:17,666
and could be useful to him.

1170
01:00:17,668 --> 01:00:21,136
Olga fell into the latter category.

1171
01:00:21,138 --> 01:00:22,504
Who's the dancer?

1172
01:00:22,506 --> 01:00:24,506
That is Olga koklova.

1173
01:00:24,508 --> 01:00:25,907
She can't dance,

1174
01:00:25,909 --> 01:00:28,676
but her father is a general
in the Russian army.

1175
01:00:28,678 --> 01:00:30,778
You better be careful.

1176
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:33,113
Of her or the general?

1177
01:00:33,115 --> 01:00:35,148
You start something with a Russian woman,

1178
01:00:35,150 --> 01:00:36,149
that's it.

1179
01:00:36,151 --> 01:00:37,984
You marry her.

1180
01:00:51,698 --> 01:00:54,465
No, she really can't dance.

1181
01:00:54,467 --> 01:00:56,300
But my peacocks are good.

1182
01:01:05,978 --> 01:01:09,145
Olga and Picasso were married in 1918.

1183
01:01:09,147 --> 01:01:12,581
Their son Paulo was born in 1921,

1184
01:01:12,583 --> 01:01:14,449
the same year as I was.

1185
01:01:17,854 --> 01:01:20,321
Paulo came in second at
the monte Carlo rally.

1186
01:01:20,323 --> 01:01:21,989
Imagine?

1187
01:01:21,991 --> 01:01:24,291
With all those professionals.

1188
01:01:24,293 --> 01:01:25,592
<i>Iviva Paulo!</i>

1189
01:01:25,594 --> 01:01:28,027
That's all he's good for,
riding that stupid motorcycle

1190
01:01:28,029 --> 01:01:29,461
I was stupid enough to buy him.

1191
01:01:29,463 --> 01:01:30,895
Playing boules with you.

1192
01:01:31,731 --> 01:01:33,130
You're a bad influence on him...

1193
01:01:33,132 --> 01:01:35,599
well, everyone Paulo meets
is a bad influence on him.

1194
01:01:35,601 --> 01:01:37,968
He's a good son. He's
very proud of you.

1195
01:01:37,970 --> 01:01:39,035
Isn't that so, mademoiselle?

1196
01:01:39,037 --> 01:01:41,370
Stop calling her mademoiselle.

1197
01:01:41,372 --> 01:01:43,004
Here she is with a child.

1198
01:01:43,006 --> 01:01:45,773
Well, 2 children, including
that lump up there.

1199
01:01:58,017 --> 01:01:59,750
It's all right, everything is fine...

1200
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:03,019
No! Let me go!

1201
01:02:05,289 --> 01:02:06,688
Pull her up at once!

1202
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:08,322
Up you come!

1203
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:11,992
It's disturbing the peace.

1204
01:02:11,994 --> 01:02:15,728
Such behavior is inadmissible.

1205
01:02:15,730 --> 01:02:17,262
Get Paulo.

1206
01:02:17,264 --> 01:02:18,496
Go get Paulo.

1207
01:02:18,498 --> 01:02:20,130
Fortunately for all concerned,

1208
01:02:20,132 --> 01:02:21,131
he's your son,

1209
01:02:21,133 --> 01:02:23,066
and as commissioner of police,

1210
01:02:23,068 --> 01:02:25,968
I can take that into
consideration for a time,

1211
01:02:25,970 --> 01:02:28,637
but you must put a stop to it, monsieur.

1212
01:02:28,639 --> 01:02:30,705
I'll put a stop to it, all right.

1213
01:02:30,707 --> 01:02:31,972
Bring Paulo, I said!

1214
01:02:31,974 --> 01:02:33,807
I'm not going in there alone!

1215
01:02:33,809 --> 01:02:35,441
He doesn't even want me in!

1216
01:02:37,778 --> 01:02:39,778
You son of a white Russian!

1217
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:41,212
Lowest form of animal life!

1218
01:02:41,214 --> 01:02:44,582
And you! You're responsible, too!
Do you hear me?

1219
01:02:44,584 --> 01:02:47,484
He's my son, you're my wife,
so he's your son also!

1220
01:02:47,486 --> 01:02:48,785
Of course.

1221
01:02:48,787 --> 01:02:50,052
It's unbelievable!

1222
01:02:50,054 --> 01:02:52,788
Throwing a woman out of the window!
Idiot!

1223
01:02:52,790 --> 01:02:54,422
Just having some fun, papa.

1224
01:02:54,424 --> 01:02:55,790
Yes.

1225
01:02:55,792 --> 01:02:57,792
Your fun is costing me too much money.

1226
01:02:57,794 --> 01:03:01,662
I'm sick of paying your debts.

1227
01:03:01,664 --> 01:03:03,764
I don't know what's to become of you.

1228
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:06,633
I never heard of such a thing.

1229
01:03:06,635 --> 01:03:08,668
I had plenty of women,
but never in my life

1230
01:03:08,670 --> 01:03:10,202
did I throw one out of a window.

1231
01:03:10,204 --> 01:03:13,438
I won't do it again,
papa. I promise.

1232
01:03:14,607 --> 01:03:16,006
Well...

1233
01:03:16,008 --> 01:03:17,340
I suppose you can't help it.

1234
01:03:17,342 --> 01:03:19,241
You're a Russian. It's
all from your mother.

1235
01:03:19,243 --> 01:03:21,409
She's mad, so you were born mad.

1236
01:03:21,411 --> 01:03:22,777
I suppose I'm to blame.

1237
01:03:22,779 --> 01:03:24,011
I should never have married her

1238
01:03:24,013 --> 01:03:25,712
or had a child with someone like that.

1239
01:03:25,714 --> 01:03:27,813
Well, then I wouldn't be here, papa.

1240
01:03:30,616 --> 01:03:32,749
I should never have married her.

1241
01:03:32,751 --> 01:03:35,318
I was warned, but I didn't listen.

1242
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:44,226
Out of a window?

1243
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:48,063
When they were first married,

1244
01:03:48,065 --> 01:03:50,765
Picasso was amused
by the smart social circles

1245
01:03:50,767 --> 01:03:52,333
to which Olga introduced him.

1246
01:03:52,335 --> 01:03:55,002
They even had a chauffeur
with white gloves,

1247
01:03:55,004 --> 01:03:57,938
the same marcel
whom I met 15 years later,

1248
01:03:57,940 --> 01:04:00,740
only without the white gloves.

1249
01:04:00,742 --> 01:04:03,976
It didn't take Picasso long to
tire of all the snobbish parties,

1250
01:04:03,978 --> 01:04:06,178
and by the 1930s, his paintings of her,

1251
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:08,847
always the surest
indication of his feelings,

1252
01:04:08,849 --> 01:04:10,849
no longer showed a radiant dancer,

1253
01:04:10,851 --> 01:04:12,951
but a prematurely aged and shrewish wife

1254
01:04:12,953 --> 01:04:14,819
whom he had come to detest.

1255
01:04:14,821 --> 01:04:16,320
Isn't it strange?

1256
01:04:16,322 --> 01:04:18,722
I have never seen you paint before.

1257
01:04:18,724 --> 01:04:20,790
Why strange? I also make love.

1258
01:04:20,792 --> 01:04:24,059
Have you ever seen me do that before?

1259
01:04:27,397 --> 01:04:29,764
Monsieur, I could do
something very good for you.

1260
01:04:29,766 --> 01:04:31,632
Lean over here.
Let me show you.

1261
01:04:33,002 --> 01:04:35,335
Would you like curls, or a wave...
Or a fringe?

1262
01:04:35,337 --> 01:04:37,603
Or would you like a
little parting, or all?

1263
01:04:38,906 --> 01:04:40,805
There, a little frieze, little bumps...

1264
01:04:40,807 --> 01:04:41,806
A little lace.

1265
01:04:41,808 --> 01:04:45,509
How beautiful...

1266
01:04:45,511 --> 01:04:47,878
Look.

1267
01:04:54,886 --> 01:04:57,186
I am madame Picasso.

1268
01:04:59,290 --> 01:05:01,055
I'm his wife.

1269
01:05:03,692 --> 01:05:05,425
You can push as many prams

1270
01:05:05,427 --> 01:05:10,196
with as many little bastards
in them as you like,

1271
01:05:10,198 --> 01:05:15,534
but there is only one madame Picasso.

1272
01:05:15,536 --> 01:05:17,969
Me!

1273
01:05:17,971 --> 01:05:19,503
Olga Picasso!

1274
01:05:19,505 --> 01:05:20,737
He has killed her,

1275
01:05:20,739 --> 01:05:24,273
and you're being haunted by her ghost.

1276
01:05:24,275 --> 01:05:26,174
Picasso!

1277
01:05:26,176 --> 01:05:29,110
Could you sleep?
Leave you alone?

1278
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:33,613
No, this is not right.

1279
01:05:33,615 --> 01:05:36,649
This is my home. I live here.

1280
01:05:36,651 --> 01:05:38,283
You hear what I say?

1281
01:05:38,285 --> 01:05:40,318
Please, this is not his child.

1282
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:41,919
No, madame... no,
no, madame, enough.

1283
01:05:41,921 --> 01:05:42,953
His child is Paulo!

1284
01:05:42,955 --> 01:05:44,387
Enough, madame, please.

1285
01:05:44,389 --> 01:05:45,221
Only Paulo.

1286
01:05:45,223 --> 01:05:46,422
Please, you must not do this.

1287
01:05:46,424 --> 01:05:47,890
Please, I live here with my husband!

1288
01:05:47,892 --> 01:05:49,092
It is no good. This is no good.

1289
01:05:49,093 --> 01:05:51,158
Please let me go in! Please!

1290
01:05:53,262 --> 01:05:54,928
My dear.

1291
01:05:54,930 --> 01:05:58,298
How your husband has made you suffer.

1292
01:06:17,850 --> 01:06:20,217
Come on, Claudio.

1293
01:06:20,219 --> 01:06:22,819
Every time someone annoys your mother,

1294
01:06:22,821 --> 01:06:24,821
you go,

1295
01:06:24,823 --> 01:06:25,988
Pa-pa...

1296
01:06:29,259 --> 01:06:30,791
I want to find another house

1297
01:06:30,793 --> 01:06:33,093
and move out of the villa pour toi.

1298
01:06:33,095 --> 01:06:35,395
Why do we have to live
in the middle of town?

1299
01:06:35,397 --> 01:06:37,096
Mo... ho... move?

1300
01:06:37,098 --> 01:06:38,497
Move? Don't be ridiculous.

1301
01:06:38,499 --> 01:06:40,999
If I had to move every
time women fought over me,

1302
01:06:41,001 --> 01:06:42,767
I'd be... eternally packing

1303
01:06:42,769 --> 01:06:44,568
and unpacking all the time.

1304
01:06:44,570 --> 01:06:46,636
I'm not fighting over you.

1305
01:06:47,872 --> 01:06:48,971
Besides...

1306
01:06:48,973 --> 01:06:50,939
We'll need more room next year.

1307
01:06:50,941 --> 01:06:53,241
Did you hear what I said?

1308
01:06:53,243 --> 01:06:54,875
What?

1309
01:06:54,877 --> 01:06:58,378
I'm going to have another baby.

1310
01:06:58,380 --> 01:06:59,912
Another one?

1311
01:06:59,914 --> 01:07:01,245
Like that?

1312
01:07:03,983 --> 01:07:05,615
When?

1313
01:07:05,617 --> 01:07:06,616
When?

1314
01:07:06,618 --> 01:07:07,618
Next year.

1315
01:07:11,188 --> 01:07:13,221
Why don't you take these?
Hey,<i> these!</i>

1316
01:07:13,223 --> 01:07:15,289
Why don't you take them yourself?

1317
01:07:21,863 --> 01:07:23,996
Can you help?

1318
01:07:23,998 --> 01:07:25,397
It wasn't my idea.

1319
01:07:25,399 --> 01:07:28,299
It was you who wanted to move.

1320
01:07:28,301 --> 01:07:31,735
Will... will you show some
more respect for my work?

1321
01:07:31,737 --> 01:07:33,169
Francoise?

1322
01:07:39,009 --> 01:07:41,242
Come upstairs.

1323
01:07:48,650 --> 01:07:50,750
Close the door!

1324
01:07:54,288 --> 01:07:56,154
Why don't you keep
your money in the bank,

1325
01:07:56,156 --> 01:07:58,189
like everybody else?

1326
01:07:58,191 --> 01:08:01,292
Banks are always crashing.

1327
01:08:01,294 --> 01:08:04,261
Ruined millionaires jump out of windows.

1328
01:08:04,263 --> 01:08:06,029
I prefer to have some ready cash.

1329
01:08:06,031 --> 01:08:07,764
Now put those into denominations:

1330
01:08:07,766 --> 01:08:09,599
Hundreds, fifties, twenties...

1331
01:08:09,601 --> 01:08:11,434
In all the years we were together,

1332
01:08:11,436 --> 01:08:13,302
Picasso gave me no money at all,

1333
01:08:13,304 --> 01:08:15,437
and I never asked him for any.

1334
01:08:15,439 --> 01:08:18,706
It was one more thing for my
grandmother to hold against him.

1335
01:08:18,708 --> 01:08:22,109
She knew I had to provide
for myself and for Claude,

1336
01:08:22,111 --> 01:08:24,411
and soon there would be the new baby.

1337
01:08:24,413 --> 01:08:26,179
I'd like to say that my grandmother

1338
01:08:26,181 --> 01:08:28,214
came to the midi to enjoy the sea air,

1339
01:08:28,216 --> 01:08:29,448
but the truth is

1340
01:08:29,450 --> 01:08:31,183
she enjoyed the casino more.

1341
01:08:31,185 --> 01:08:32,717
She was a great gambler,

1342
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:36,086
and unlike other gamblers,
she usually won.

1343
01:08:37,656 --> 01:08:38,721
Francoise?

1344
01:08:38,723 --> 01:08:39,788
I can't...

1345
01:08:39,790 --> 01:08:41,656
no. I know he gives you nothing

1346
01:08:41,658 --> 01:08:43,457
for you or the child.

1347
01:08:43,459 --> 01:08:45,492
The man's a multimillionaire.

1348
01:08:45,494 --> 01:08:47,961
It's supposed to be a test of character.

1349
01:08:47,963 --> 01:08:50,463
How to survive on nothing.

1350
01:08:56,870 --> 01:09:00,438
Fortunately, I was
beginning to earn with my own work.

1351
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:02,440
Picasso didn't directly influence me,

1352
01:09:02,442 --> 01:09:04,008
but I was surrounded by him

1353
01:09:04,010 --> 01:09:05,542
as if he were an element,

1354
01:09:05,544 --> 01:09:08,611
as in an element...
say, water... I swam,

1355
01:09:08,613 --> 01:09:11,246
but he wasn't teaching me how to swim.

1356
01:09:11,248 --> 01:09:12,680
He said, "painting can't be taught."

1357
01:09:12,682 --> 01:09:14,448
It can only be found."

1358
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:17,584
"Don't try to be Picasso.

1359
01:09:17,586 --> 01:09:19,118
Be yourself."

1360
01:09:36,169 --> 01:09:40,237
How many paintings
could you let me have a year?

1361
01:09:40,239 --> 01:09:42,505
I might be able to give
you a show in the spring,

1362
01:09:42,507 --> 01:09:44,406
and we could talk then about
a contract on future works.

1363
01:09:44,408 --> 01:09:46,241
No. I'll do the talking.

1364
01:09:46,243 --> 01:09:47,475
To be under contract to kahnweiler

1365
01:09:47,477 --> 01:09:50,578
is the surest way to starve to death.

1366
01:09:50,580 --> 01:09:52,646
No, no, no.

1367
01:09:52,648 --> 01:09:56,383
The, news from America is not so good.

1368
01:09:56,385 --> 01:10:00,553
Matisse is all right. His
prices are rising, but...

1369
01:10:00,555 --> 01:10:04,123
They are not buying picassos.

1370
01:10:04,125 --> 01:10:07,792
Why not? Because I joined
the communist party?

1371
01:10:09,462 --> 01:10:10,494
Good.

1372
01:10:10,496 --> 01:10:11,294
Fine.

1373
01:10:11,296 --> 01:10:12,662
I'm satisfied.

1374
01:10:12,664 --> 01:10:15,398
You wouldn't understand this, kahnweiler,

1375
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:17,666
but it's only since I
joined the communist party

1376
01:10:17,668 --> 01:10:21,669
that I feel once again
I am among my brothers.

1377
01:10:22,805 --> 01:10:25,806
You'll see. They'll be
strikes and troubles.

1378
01:10:25,808 --> 01:10:29,409
They'll be marching and
singing in the streets...

1379
01:10:29,411 --> 01:10:33,413
And you'll be hanging from a lamppost.
Ack-ck-ck-ck!

1380
01:10:36,618 --> 01:10:38,017
Comrades...

1381
01:10:38,019 --> 01:10:39,318
Stalin.

1382
01:10:40,421 --> 01:10:41,953
Stalin! Stalin! Stalin! Stalin!

1383
01:10:41,955 --> 01:10:43,220
Stalin! Stalin! Stalin! Stalin!

1384
01:10:44,623 --> 01:10:45,622
Picasso.

1385
01:10:45,624 --> 01:10:47,857
Picasso! Picasso!
Picasso! Picasso!

1386
01:10:47,859 --> 01:10:49,091
Thank you.

1387
01:10:49,093 --> 01:10:50,826
In joining the communist party,

1388
01:10:50,828 --> 01:10:53,795
Picasso had followed many other
artists and intellectuals

1389
01:10:53,797 --> 01:10:57,431
for whom communism was a new theology,

1390
01:10:57,433 --> 01:10:59,433
with God replaced by Stalin.

1391
01:10:59,435 --> 01:11:02,702
Taking along his chauffeur
marcel for company,

1392
01:11:02,704 --> 01:11:06,072
Picasso attended a party
conference in Poland.

1393
01:11:06,074 --> 01:11:07,473
It is our duty...

1394
01:11:07,475 --> 01:11:09,441
They hated his art,

1395
01:11:09,443 --> 01:11:10,942
but they loved his name

1396
01:11:10,944 --> 01:11:14,645
and knew what a useful
propaganda tool he was for them.

1397
01:11:14,647 --> 01:11:16,213
Anarchy in his art,

1398
01:11:16,215 --> 01:11:21,751
which places the individual
outside the masses.

1399
01:11:27,424 --> 01:11:29,323
Thank you, comrades...

1400
01:11:29,325 --> 01:11:30,924
The international proletariat...

1401
01:11:30,926 --> 01:11:35,261
It is a great honor for me to
be here with you this evening,

1402
01:11:35,263 --> 01:11:36,862
a very great honor.

1403
01:11:36,864 --> 01:11:40,665
However, I must take exception
to my good comrade's remarks

1404
01:11:40,667 --> 01:11:42,867
when he uses the word "anarchy"

1405
01:11:42,869 --> 01:11:44,268
in connection with my work.

1406
01:11:44,270 --> 01:11:46,470
I am not an anarchist,
and I never have been.

1407
01:11:47,940 --> 01:11:49,739
My work is a constructive one.

1408
01:11:49,741 --> 01:11:52,341
I am building, not tearing down.

1409
01:11:52,343 --> 01:11:54,276
Anarchy... anarchy in art

1410
01:11:54,278 --> 01:11:56,678
is a petit-bourgeois concept,

1411
01:11:56,680 --> 01:12:00,514
which condemns the artist to mediocrity,

1412
01:12:00,516 --> 01:12:04,551
incapacity, and malfeasance.

1413
01:12:04,553 --> 01:12:07,920
Your impressionist, surrealist style...

1414
01:12:10,391 --> 01:12:12,957
comrade, if you...
if you must insult me...

1415
01:12:14,894 --> 01:12:16,693
At least...

1416
01:12:16,695 --> 01:12:19,028
Get your terminologies straight.

1417
01:12:19,030 --> 01:12:20,996
Monsieur Picasso!

1418
01:12:26,902 --> 01:12:28,101
Picasso!

1419
01:12:32,973 --> 01:12:36,541
Pierre, I can't let you photograph
here without his permission.

1420
01:12:36,543 --> 01:12:40,310
Of course. Everything has to
be done with his permission.

1421
01:12:40,312 --> 01:12:42,312
I'm sorry.

1422
01:12:42,314 --> 01:12:44,314
When's he back?

1423
01:12:44,316 --> 01:12:47,917
He said he'd be gone 3 days,

1424
01:12:47,919 --> 01:12:49,952
and he's been gone 3 weeks.

1425
01:12:53,590 --> 01:12:55,656
Do you ever hear from Genevieve?

1426
01:12:55,658 --> 01:12:56,456
Yeah.

1427
01:12:56,458 --> 01:12:57,590
Is she still in montpellier?

1428
01:12:57,592 --> 01:12:59,558
She comes to Paris sometimes.

1429
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:02,360
Don't you see her anymore?

1430
01:13:04,731 --> 01:13:08,999
He doesn't like me to
have friends of my own.

1431
01:13:10,736 --> 01:13:14,337
Every day I get this
telegram from Poland.

1432
01:13:14,339 --> 01:13:17,340
"Hugs and kisses,
from Picasso."

1433
01:13:17,342 --> 01:13:19,241
Hugs and kisses...

1434
01:13:19,243 --> 01:13:21,142
That's not Pablo.
That's marcel.

1435
01:13:21,144 --> 01:13:26,947
He must have told marcel, "send
her a telegram every day."

1436
01:13:26,949 --> 01:13:28,748
Keep her quiet."

1437
01:13:32,119 --> 01:13:33,618
Francoise!

1438
01:13:37,556 --> 01:13:38,688
What?

1439
01:13:42,392 --> 01:13:45,493
That's for the hugs and kisses.

1440
01:13:54,369 --> 01:13:56,335
Francoise?

1441
01:14:06,547 --> 01:14:09,748
See what I've brought you from Poland.

1442
01:14:09,750 --> 01:14:10,949
Francoise?

1443
01:14:30,401 --> 01:14:31,400
Look...

1444
01:14:31,402 --> 01:14:33,402
I bought it for you.

1445
01:14:33,404 --> 01:14:35,069
Here you are.

1446
01:14:37,406 --> 01:14:38,805
Open it.

1447
01:14:49,918 --> 01:14:51,050
Olá.

1448
01:14:56,123 --> 01:14:58,389
Put it on.

1449
01:14:59,725 --> 01:15:02,926
He was brilliant at coaxing a woman,

1450
01:15:02,928 --> 01:15:06,296
changing her mood, treating her as a pet.

1451
01:15:06,298 --> 01:15:07,930
He loved pets.

1452
01:15:07,932 --> 01:15:10,532
He didn't care for people so much.

1453
01:15:10,534 --> 01:15:13,535
People could be difficult
and give him trouble.

1454
01:15:18,941 --> 01:15:21,942
Our daughter
was called Paloma: The dove.

1455
01:15:21,944 --> 01:15:25,278
She was a model baby who slept
practically round the clock.

1456
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:26,912
Picasso was delighted with her,

1457
01:15:26,914 --> 01:15:29,915
especially as she never
disturbed him at night.

1458
01:15:29,917 --> 01:15:31,950
She'll be a perfect woman:

1459
01:15:31,952 --> 01:15:36,020
Passive and submissive,
as all girls should be...

1460
01:15:36,022 --> 01:15:37,688
And their mothers.

1461
01:15:42,293 --> 01:15:43,292
Claude.

1462
01:15:43,294 --> 01:15:44,960
Look.

1463
01:15:46,029 --> 01:15:47,028
Look.

1464
01:15:47,030 --> 01:15:48,429
Where are we going?

1465
01:15:48,431 --> 01:15:49,696
Look.

1466
01:15:53,368 --> 01:15:58,437
He loved being with the
children for short periods of time.

1467
01:15:58,439 --> 01:16:01,706
He spent most of his days away from us,

1468
01:16:01,708 --> 01:16:03,974
assembling his pieces of scrap metal,

1469
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:05,976
arranging what he called,
"the chance meeting

1470
01:16:05,978 --> 01:16:10,380
on a dissecting table of a
sewing machine and an umbrella."

1471
01:16:10,382 --> 01:16:13,983
He would turn an old radiator
into an accordion player

1472
01:16:13,985 --> 01:16:18,720
and explain it as a metaphor to
fool not the eye, but the mind.

1473
01:16:21,591 --> 01:16:22,590
<i>Dominus vobiscum.</i>

1474
01:16:22,592 --> 01:16:26,125
<i>Et cum spiritus tou.</i>

1475
01:16:29,029 --> 01:16:31,729
<i>Benedictat vos omnipotens deus,</i>

1476
01:16:31,731 --> 01:16:35,998
<i>pater et filius et spiritus sanctus.</i>

1477
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,599
Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.

1478
01:16:37,601 --> 01:16:39,567
<i>Ita mista est.</i>

1479
01:16:39,569 --> 01:16:41,936
<i>Deo gratias.</i>

1480
01:16:56,619 --> 01:17:00,220
All this is typical of Matisse.

1481
01:17:00,222 --> 01:17:03,022
There is no terror in him.

1482
01:17:03,024 --> 01:17:05,224
Of course, compared with me,

1483
01:17:05,226 --> 01:17:07,025
Matisse is a young lady.

1484
01:17:07,027 --> 01:17:10,628
I don't know how he can do all this

1485
01:17:10,630 --> 01:17:13,230
and not believe what it represents.

1486
01:17:13,232 --> 01:17:14,764
It's morally wrong.

1487
01:17:14,766 --> 01:17:18,434
You don't believe, but you made<i> me</i> swear.

1488
01:17:18,436 --> 01:17:21,737
Do you remember how you made
me swear to love you forever?

1489
01:17:21,739 --> 01:17:23,171
He should have built a market,

1490
01:17:23,173 --> 01:17:25,873
then he could paint his
usual fruit and vegetables

1491
01:17:25,875 --> 01:17:28,642
and his pretty flowers
instead of all this.

1492
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:29,976
Why don't you swear now?

1493
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:33,212
Why don't you swear to love
me and the children forever

1494
01:17:33,214 --> 01:17:35,747
or at least the children?

1495
01:17:35,749 --> 01:17:38,082
What are you talking about?

1496
01:17:39,752 --> 01:17:41,351
You don't believe...

1497
01:17:41,353 --> 01:17:43,853
So it wouldn't mean anything...

1498
01:17:43,855 --> 01:17:45,855
And it might help us.

1499
01:17:45,857 --> 01:17:50,826
What's the matter with you?

1500
01:17:50,828 --> 01:17:55,030
The only time I've ever seen
Picasso put himself out for anyone,

1501
01:17:55,032 --> 01:17:57,532
except when he was wooing a new woman,

1502
01:17:57,534 --> 01:18:01,768
was when we visited Matisse
at the hotel Regina in nice.

1503
01:18:01,770 --> 01:18:05,171
Matisse tended to treat
Picasso like a favorite son

1504
01:18:05,173 --> 01:18:07,072
of whom he couldn't quite approve.

1505
01:18:07,074 --> 01:18:10,108
They exchanged paintings, but
they were always on their guard,

1506
01:18:10,110 --> 01:18:12,110
each speculating about the other's work

1507
01:18:12,112 --> 01:18:14,112
and asking, "what's he doing?"

1508
01:18:14,114 --> 01:18:18,015
But Picasso said, "finally,
there is only Matisse."

1509
01:18:18,017 --> 01:18:22,618
When he goes, there will be
nothing left to say to anyone."

1510
01:18:22,620 --> 01:18:24,386
Henri, Lydia...

1511
01:18:24,388 --> 01:18:25,787
This is francoise.

1512
01:18:25,789 --> 01:18:27,388
Monsieur Matisse.

1513
01:18:27,390 --> 01:18:28,655
Hello.

1514
01:18:30,191 --> 01:18:32,991
These are very special
dates from Madagascar.

1515
01:18:32,993 --> 01:18:33,992
Take one.

1516
01:18:33,994 --> 01:18:35,393
No. No.

1517
01:18:35,395 --> 01:18:36,394
No?

1518
01:18:36,396 --> 01:18:38,529
Please.

1519
01:18:38,531 --> 01:18:39,530
Lydia?

1520
01:18:39,532 --> 01:18:40,864
Thank you.

1521
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:43,699
You're wearing my colors:

1522
01:18:43,701 --> 01:18:45,200
Mauve and olive green.

1523
01:18:45,202 --> 01:18:47,068
I told you to wear them.
It was my idea.

1524
01:18:47,070 --> 01:18:51,538
No. You told me
to wear mauve and pink.

1525
01:18:51,540 --> 01:18:55,741
Whatever I say, francoise is
assured to say the opposite.

1526
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:58,744
I live in a perpetual
climate of contradiction.

1527
01:18:58,746 --> 01:19:00,278
I feel very sorry for you.

1528
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:04,414
You always did have a bad time
with beautiful young women.

1529
01:19:04,416 --> 01:19:06,215
But whoever had the idea...

1530
01:19:06,217 --> 01:19:10,219
I would like to paint
francoise in those colors.

1531
01:19:10,221 --> 01:19:15,023
Her hair would be blue,
her cheeks light green,

1532
01:19:15,025 --> 01:19:19,260
but of course her eyebrows
would rhyme with her ears.

1533
01:19:19,262 --> 01:19:23,029
I suppose you could send francoise
around to pose for me?

1534
01:19:23,031 --> 01:19:25,231
Certainly...

1535
01:19:25,233 --> 01:19:28,834
If you send Lydia
in exchange to pose for me.

1536
01:19:28,836 --> 01:19:31,102
Probably Lydia wouldn't like that.

1537
01:19:31,104 --> 01:19:33,437
Did you know that women
in Paris curse each other,

1538
01:19:33,439 --> 01:19:34,738
"may you be painted by Picasso,

1539
01:19:34,740 --> 01:19:37,974
the eyes and the ears,
the nose and the mouth"?

1540
01:19:37,976 --> 01:19:39,842
Now that I do not get out very much,

1541
01:19:39,844 --> 01:19:43,845
I've made myself a little
garden to walk in.

1542
01:19:43,847 --> 01:19:47,448
Everything is here...

1543
01:19:47,450 --> 01:19:48,449
Fruit...

1544
01:19:48,451 --> 01:19:49,450
Flowers...

1545
01:19:49,452 --> 01:19:50,517
Leaves...

1546
01:19:50,519 --> 01:19:52,452
A few birds.

1547
01:19:56,590 --> 01:19:58,723
My own swimming pool.

1548
01:20:00,526 --> 01:20:02,192
You like to swim?

1549
01:20:05,263 --> 01:20:07,963
We went to see your chapel in vence.

1550
01:20:07,965 --> 01:20:13,467
And I expect you found
plenty to criticize.

1551
01:20:13,469 --> 01:20:15,902
No. I thought it was beautiful.

1552
01:20:15,904 --> 01:20:17,236
Except the choice of subject matter.

1553
01:20:17,238 --> 01:20:20,005
What do these symbols mean to you?

1554
01:20:21,274 --> 01:20:26,543
If we don't pray, we have
no right to portray prayer.

1555
01:20:26,545 --> 01:20:28,278
But we do pray.

1556
01:20:29,281 --> 01:20:32,482
When we are working we are praying.

1557
01:20:32,484 --> 01:20:34,150
You know that yourself.

1558
01:20:35,486 --> 01:20:37,285
No...

1559
01:20:37,287 --> 01:20:42,489
I've no religion in
the conventional sense,

1560
01:20:42,491 --> 01:20:44,423
yet I believe.

1561
01:20:46,493 --> 01:20:49,894
There's a zen saying...

1562
01:20:49,896 --> 01:20:52,096
"We have two suns:

1563
01:20:52,098 --> 01:20:56,700
"The one outside in the sky,
and the other inside here.

1564
01:20:56,702 --> 01:20:59,636
"As the one outside fades for us, so...

1565
01:20:59,638 --> 01:21:03,906
The other raises up
more and more."

1566
01:21:03,908 --> 01:21:05,908
Since my last illness,

1567
01:21:05,910 --> 01:21:09,911
I feel I carry a sun with a
thousand rays inside me.

1568
01:21:11,347 --> 01:21:12,412
Yes.

1569
01:21:13,515 --> 01:21:15,915
So you've...

1570
01:21:15,917 --> 01:21:18,918
Made for yourself a little harem,

1571
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:23,188
an assortment of beautiful women

1572
01:21:23,190 --> 01:21:26,924
awaiting your every pleasure.

1573
01:21:26,926 --> 01:21:28,325
The older I get,

1574
01:21:28,327 --> 01:21:31,928
the younger and more ardent
is my imagination.

1575
01:21:31,930 --> 01:21:37,332
Of course, when I was 25,
I did not need imagination.

1576
01:21:37,334 --> 01:21:40,201
You've loved women even more than I have,

1577
01:21:40,203 --> 01:21:41,769
but you haven't hated them at all.

1578
01:21:41,771 --> 01:21:43,470
I leave that to you.

1579
01:21:48,109 --> 01:21:50,409
I have a present for you.

1580
01:21:50,411 --> 01:21:51,376
For me?

1581
01:21:51,378 --> 01:21:53,244
As soon as I saw it, I thought of you.

1582
01:21:53,246 --> 01:21:54,578
A present for me.

1583
01:21:54,580 --> 01:21:58,547
Lydia, bring in our funny new
friend to meet Mr. Picasso.

1584
01:22:00,551 --> 01:22:05,152
Monsieur Matisse has been waiting
for you to come and claim it.

1585
01:22:05,154 --> 01:22:07,754
Put it in monsieur Picasso's car.

1586
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:09,155
Unfortunately, there's
no room in the car.

1587
01:22:09,157 --> 01:22:10,756
It's full of francoise's mess.

1588
01:22:10,758 --> 01:22:12,258
I'll send marcel for it tomorrow.

1589
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:13,859
Put it over your head.

1590
01:22:13,861 --> 01:22:15,260
What is it?

1591
01:22:15,262 --> 01:22:17,862
Well, go on. It won't hurt you.

1592
01:22:17,864 --> 01:22:19,263
It's a ceremonial headdress

1593
01:22:19,265 --> 01:22:21,465
used for magical invocations.

1594
01:22:21,467 --> 01:22:22,866
Yeah. That's right.

1595
01:22:22,868 --> 01:22:26,735
It is from the nevinbumbaau
Vanuatu tribe.

1596
01:22:26,737 --> 01:22:28,336
He likes it!

1597
01:22:29,272 --> 01:22:31,839
Isn't it exactly Picasso?

1598
01:22:31,841 --> 01:22:34,474
I don't see why he
should give me such a...

1599
01:22:34,476 --> 01:22:35,875
An ugly thing.

1600
01:22:35,877 --> 01:22:37,877
He thought you'd like it.

1601
01:22:37,879 --> 01:22:38,878
Yeah?

1602
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:40,479
He's very fond of you.

1603
01:22:40,481 --> 01:22:41,480
Really?

1604
01:22:41,482 --> 01:22:42,481
Really.

1605
01:22:42,483 --> 01:22:43,882
You think so?

1606
01:22:43,884 --> 01:22:45,884
You think he likes me?

1607
01:22:45,886 --> 01:22:47,285
Monsieur Matisse loves you, monsieur.

1608
01:22:47,287 --> 01:22:49,587
Go get the idol tomorrow, then.

1609
01:22:54,359 --> 01:22:56,959
This time, we double the stakes.

1610
01:22:58,495 --> 01:22:59,894
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1611
01:22:59,896 --> 01:23:01,896
I've already dealt the cards.

1612
01:23:01,898 --> 01:23:04,899
Well, I told you to wait for me.

1613
01:23:04,901 --> 01:23:06,101
Double the stakes, by the way.

1614
01:23:17,245 --> 01:23:18,177
Hey!

1615
01:23:18,179 --> 01:23:20,812
How do you like my woman?

1616
01:23:20,814 --> 01:23:22,046
You're jealous now?

1617
01:23:22,048 --> 01:23:23,180
What did you say?!

1618
01:23:23,182 --> 01:23:25,582
She wants to sleep with me!

1619
01:23:25,584 --> 01:23:28,318
You haven't slept with a real chauffeur?

1620
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:29,319
Wha!

1621
01:23:29,321 --> 01:23:31,521
She's a good driver?

1622
01:23:31,523 --> 01:23:34,023
Marcel, look out!

1623
01:23:37,895 --> 01:23:39,594
Marcel!

1624
01:24:00,849 --> 01:24:02,215
You're late.

1625
01:24:03,551 --> 01:24:05,217
Where's my car?

1626
01:24:06,553 --> 01:24:08,252
Where's my car?

1627
01:24:08,254 --> 01:24:10,687
Monsieur, there's been a little accident.

1628
01:24:10,689 --> 01:24:11,821
A little?

1629
01:24:11,823 --> 01:24:13,222
Scratch? Fender bent?

1630
01:24:13,224 --> 01:24:16,225
I warned you the next time you get drunk

1631
01:24:16,227 --> 01:24:17,826
and there's as much as a
scratch on my car, you're out.

1632
01:24:17,828 --> 01:24:19,961
Now, tell me, where is it?!

1633
01:24:19,963 --> 01:24:21,963
It's in a ditch.

1634
01:24:21,965 --> 01:24:23,397
My new car's in the ditch?

1635
01:24:23,399 --> 01:24:25,365
You two drunken sods have
left my car in the ditch?

1636
01:24:25,367 --> 01:24:26,566
See, what happened was...

1637
01:24:26,568 --> 01:24:27,433
I know what happened.

1638
01:24:27,435 --> 01:24:28,600
You were sitting in Chez Jacques,

1639
01:24:28,602 --> 01:24:30,301
getting drunk on your eternal pastis!

1640
01:24:30,303 --> 01:24:32,136
Well, this is it. My car is
finished, and so are you.

1641
01:24:32,138 --> 01:24:33,370
You're not fit to be my chauffeur.

1642
01:24:33,372 --> 01:24:34,971
You're only fit to
lead this idiot astray.

1643
01:24:34,973 --> 01:24:36,205
He's my son.

1644
01:24:36,207 --> 01:24:38,106
Unfortunately, I can't get rid of him.

1645
01:24:38,108 --> 01:24:39,373
He's around my neck
for the rest of my life,

1646
01:24:39,375 --> 01:24:40,640
but you, you're finished!

1647
01:24:40,642 --> 01:24:41,807
But you can't.

1648
01:24:41,809 --> 01:24:43,275
Who asked you?

1649
01:24:43,277 --> 01:24:45,577
Monsieur, I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.
It was my fault.

1650
01:24:45,579 --> 01:24:47,979
You take the next train to Paris.

1651
01:24:47,981 --> 01:24:51,382
Tell sabartes what is due on your wages

1652
01:24:51,384 --> 01:24:55,385
after deducting the cost
of the damages to my car.

1653
01:24:55,387 --> 01:24:58,254
I don't ever want to see you again.

1654
01:24:58,256 --> 01:24:59,588
Monsieur, I'm very sorry.

1655
01:24:59,590 --> 01:25:00,789
It was my fault,

1656
01:25:00,791 --> 01:25:03,258
but I've been with you all
these years, 25 years.

1657
01:25:03,260 --> 01:25:04,392
25 years too long.
Bring that upstairs.

1658
01:25:04,394 --> 01:25:05,693
You mean after all this time...

1659
01:25:05,695 --> 01:25:06,894
what?

1660
01:25:06,896 --> 01:25:08,795
After everything I've been
to you, you'd fire me?

1661
01:25:08,797 --> 01:25:11,597
Yes, I'm firing you.

1662
01:25:11,599 --> 01:25:13,999
I should have known.

1663
01:25:14,001 --> 01:25:15,600
I warn you...

1664
01:25:15,602 --> 01:25:17,401
The day will come

1665
01:25:17,403 --> 01:25:20,604
and you will have no one left,

1666
01:25:20,606 --> 01:25:22,005
not even francoise.

1667
01:25:22,007 --> 01:25:23,039
You'll see.

1668
01:25:23,041 --> 01:25:24,306
One day she'll have had enough.

1669
01:25:24,308 --> 01:25:27,676
She'll walk out on you.

1670
01:25:49,032 --> 01:25:53,033
Picasso had begun making
ceramics at the vallauris potteries,

1671
01:25:53,035 --> 01:25:56,036
and his work there
was playful and pretty.

1672
01:25:56,038 --> 01:25:57,437
Some said too pretty.

1673
01:25:57,439 --> 01:26:00,440
He protested, "they want to be shocked",

1674
01:26:00,442 --> 01:26:02,842
and if I smile,
they're disappointed."

1675
01:26:02,844 --> 01:26:05,845
Besides the fascination
of working in a new medium,

1676
01:26:05,847 --> 01:26:09,448
the potteries held another
fascination for him.

1677
01:26:53,359 --> 01:26:56,360
You see, to make a woman...

1678
01:26:56,362 --> 01:27:00,564
You first have to wring her neck.

1679
01:27:15,113 --> 01:27:17,513
He says, "to make a woman",

1680
01:27:17,515 --> 01:27:20,516
you have to wring
her neck first."

1681
01:27:20,518 --> 01:27:23,519
To me, he said that about a dove.

1682
01:27:23,521 --> 01:27:26,121
It's all the same to him.

1683
01:27:26,123 --> 01:27:27,722
A thing's a thing.

1684
01:28:37,790 --> 01:28:39,189
Olá.

1685
01:28:39,191 --> 01:28:41,490
Sleep well, papa!

1686
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:44,025
Olá.

1687
01:28:54,803 --> 01:28:56,803
Why aren't you asleep?

1688
01:28:56,805 --> 01:28:58,805
I was waiting for you.

1689
01:28:58,807 --> 01:29:01,807
Were you spying on me?

1690
01:29:03,210 --> 01:29:07,611
Look, I come and go how and when I want.

1691
01:29:07,613 --> 01:29:09,813
I didn't say you couldn't.

1692
01:29:09,815 --> 01:29:11,214
I was worried.

1693
01:29:11,216 --> 01:29:13,816
Paulo might have had too much to drink

1694
01:29:13,818 --> 01:29:15,083
and smashed up the car.

1695
01:29:15,085 --> 01:29:16,417
Who knows? Anything
could happen.

1696
01:29:16,419 --> 01:29:18,218
In front of my friends, embarrassing me.

1697
01:29:18,220 --> 01:29:19,219
Your friends?

1698
01:29:19,221 --> 01:29:20,220
Yes!

1699
01:29:20,222 --> 01:29:22,222
I saw only one friend.

1700
01:29:22,224 --> 01:29:24,023
So, what business is it of yours

1701
01:29:24,025 --> 01:29:28,093
if there was one friend
or a hundred of them?

1702
01:29:28,095 --> 01:29:31,663
I go where I want.
I see who I want.

1703
01:29:31,665 --> 01:29:34,532
Yes, and I sleep or don't
sleep with who I want.

1704
01:29:38,037 --> 01:29:39,836
Why didn't you go to bed,

1705
01:29:39,838 --> 01:29:41,904
where you should have been hours ago?

1706
01:29:41,906 --> 01:29:44,506
You look tired.

1707
01:29:44,508 --> 01:29:47,509
Well, it's hardly worth it now.

1708
01:29:47,511 --> 01:29:50,645
It's almost time for you
to go and light the stove

1709
01:29:50,647 --> 01:29:54,548
in the studio, or it
won't be fit to work in.

1710
01:29:54,550 --> 01:29:59,386
It's one damned annoyance
after the other for me.

1711
01:30:12,834 --> 01:30:16,669
Picasso could never
keep a new affair a secret

1712
01:30:16,671 --> 01:30:19,405
because as soon as he
had a new woman in his life,

1713
01:30:19,407 --> 01:30:22,941
a new face began to appear
in his paintings.

1714
01:30:22,943 --> 01:30:25,944
Now it was jacqueline from
the vallauris potteries,

1715
01:30:25,946 --> 01:30:27,946
but, as always, when
he changed directions,

1716
01:30:27,948 --> 01:30:31,549
as when he changed
from Marie-therese to dora,

1717
01:30:31,551 --> 01:30:33,951
there was a certain
ambiguity in his work,

1718
01:30:33,953 --> 01:30:38,088
maybe expressing a general
restlessness and discontent.

1719
01:30:41,560 --> 01:30:43,760
He had appointed Paulo
to be his chauffeur.

1720
01:30:43,762 --> 01:30:49,398
He said, "let him be useful for the first
and probably the last time in his life."

1721
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:50,966
They would spin around the midi,

1722
01:30:50,968 --> 01:30:53,568
and reports would reach me
via obliging friends

1723
01:30:53,570 --> 01:30:57,705
of where Picasso had been
seen and with whom.

1724
01:31:36,744 --> 01:31:39,010
I still don't see why
we can't go with you.

1725
01:31:39,012 --> 01:31:42,213
I told you. The air in Paris
is no good for the children.

1726
01:31:42,215 --> 01:31:43,614
They're much better off here.

1727
01:31:43,616 --> 01:31:45,215
What about the things I told you to do,

1728
01:31:45,217 --> 01:31:49,385
like supervising him so he doesn't
break all my best pieces?

1729
01:31:55,025 --> 01:31:58,026
Don't you want us to be with you?

1730
01:31:58,028 --> 01:31:59,027
Yeah.

1731
01:31:59,029 --> 01:32:01,863
Don't you think we ought to be together?

1732
01:32:01,865 --> 01:32:05,032
We are together.
We're always together.

1733
01:32:07,102 --> 01:32:08,433
Hey!

1734
01:32:10,470 --> 01:32:11,669
Big boy!

1735
01:32:11,671 --> 01:32:12,836
Hey!

1736
01:32:54,010 --> 01:32:55,275
Hello?

1737
01:32:55,277 --> 01:32:56,576
Hello?

1738
01:32:56,578 --> 01:32:58,411
Is that francoise?

1739
01:32:58,413 --> 01:32:59,879
Yes?

1740
01:32:59,881 --> 01:33:00,813
Father.

1741
01:33:00,815 --> 01:33:03,882
I have something to tell you...

1742
01:33:06,019 --> 01:33:07,084
What?

1743
01:33:11,890 --> 01:33:13,289
Pierre...

1744
01:33:13,291 --> 01:33:16,292
My father telephoned.

1745
01:33:16,294 --> 01:33:19,295
My grandmother's had a stroke.

1746
01:33:19,297 --> 01:33:20,729
She's paralyzed.

1747
01:33:20,731 --> 01:33:24,565
I haven't seen or spoken to my father

1748
01:33:24,567 --> 01:33:25,799
since I walked out of his house.

1749
01:33:25,801 --> 01:33:27,967
You can catch the 11:45 train.

1750
01:33:27,969 --> 01:33:29,935
I'll take you to the station.

1751
01:33:29,937 --> 01:33:33,038
How can I go to Paris?
He'll be furious.

1752
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:34,272
Who'll be furious?

1753
01:33:34,274 --> 01:33:37,809
Picasso. He's left me with
a million things to do.

1754
01:33:37,811 --> 01:33:39,010
Get the children ready.

1755
01:33:39,012 --> 01:33:42,413
I'll pick you up at the house in an hour.

1756
01:33:42,415 --> 01:33:44,415
You have to go.

1757
01:33:44,417 --> 01:33:46,417
You don't know what he's like

1758
01:33:46,419 --> 01:33:48,552
if anyone goes against his orders.

1759
01:33:48,554 --> 01:33:52,222
This isn't the francoise I used to know.

1760
01:33:52,224 --> 01:33:56,425
A hundred picassos
couldn't order her around.

1761
01:33:56,427 --> 01:33:58,894
Go and pack.

1762
01:34:02,032 --> 01:34:03,297
Go.

1763
01:34:27,990 --> 01:34:29,122
Father!

1764
01:34:35,863 --> 01:34:38,363
She died last night.

1765
01:34:45,538 --> 01:34:46,937
I was waiting for you

1766
01:34:46,939 --> 01:34:49,773
before deciding on the
funeral arrangements.

1767
01:35:30,915 --> 01:35:32,314
I'm sorry,

1768
01:35:32,316 --> 01:35:35,784
but the number you dialed
has been disconnected.

1769
01:35:40,790 --> 01:35:42,156
Hello?

1770
01:35:42,158 --> 01:35:45,125
Hello. May I speak to
madame berthier, please?

1771
01:35:45,127 --> 01:35:46,526
Who is this?

1772
01:35:46,528 --> 01:35:47,927
You don't know me.

1773
01:35:47,929 --> 01:35:50,529
I'm the granddaughter of
a great friend of hers.

1774
01:35:50,531 --> 01:35:53,532
Madame berthier died 3 years ago.

1775
01:35:53,534 --> 01:35:56,535
I'm so sorry.
I had no idea.

1776
01:35:56,537 --> 01:35:57,802
Good-bye.

1777
01:36:25,964 --> 01:36:27,897
All her friends are gone.

1778
01:36:27,899 --> 01:36:30,099
I can't find a soul.

1779
01:36:30,101 --> 01:36:35,037
Well, when you live to a ripe
old age, that's what happens.

1780
01:36:35,039 --> 01:36:39,040
There's no one left
to come to your funeral.

1781
01:36:41,644 --> 01:36:43,443
When this is all over,

1782
01:36:43,445 --> 01:36:47,046
we have a lot of financial
business to discuss.

1783
01:36:47,048 --> 01:36:48,947
There's only you and me now.

1784
01:36:48,949 --> 01:36:51,516
We must talk about the
children, about their schools.

1785
01:36:56,656 --> 01:36:59,056
Is there really no one else?

1786
01:36:59,058 --> 01:37:00,657
No.

1787
01:37:00,659 --> 01:37:02,458
Have a look.

1788
01:37:07,064 --> 01:37:10,665
What about all of those old boyfriends?

1789
01:37:10,667 --> 01:37:12,800
Stop it.

1790
01:37:25,080 --> 01:37:28,081
Pierre sent me a telegram.

1791
01:37:28,083 --> 01:37:30,683
He thought you might need me.

1792
01:37:30,685 --> 01:37:32,685
Genevieve!

1793
01:37:40,293 --> 01:37:41,525
Pablo's in Paris.

1794
01:37:41,527 --> 01:37:44,928
I've got to tell him about
my grandmother's funeral.

1795
01:37:44,930 --> 01:37:47,330
Why? Was he your
grandmother's friend?

1796
01:37:47,332 --> 01:37:51,100
No, but he's the father of my children,

1797
01:37:51,102 --> 01:37:52,701
her great-grandchildren,

1798
01:37:52,703 --> 01:37:55,503
not that I expect him to come.

1799
01:37:55,505 --> 01:37:58,706
He didn't even go to
his own mother's funeral.

1800
01:37:58,708 --> 01:38:02,109
He so abhors any idea of mortality,

1801
01:38:02,111 --> 01:38:04,377
of his own mortality.

1802
01:38:17,324 --> 01:38:18,723
So she said...

1803
01:38:20,126 --> 01:38:23,393
She said, "I want you
to paint my portrait."

1804
01:38:37,575 --> 01:38:38,575
Those?

1805
01:38:39,610 --> 01:38:40,609
Papa!

1806
01:38:40,611 --> 01:38:42,644
What are you doing here? Hey.

1807
01:38:43,747 --> 01:38:46,347
Hey, where's your mother?

1808
01:38:46,349 --> 01:38:48,349
Where is she?

1809
01:38:48,351 --> 01:38:50,084
Where's your mother?

1810
01:38:51,754 --> 01:38:55,088
What are they doing up here?

1811
01:38:56,357 --> 01:38:57,556
Francoise?

1812
01:39:10,770 --> 01:39:13,103
Why have you come here to Paris?

1813
01:39:13,105 --> 01:39:15,105
Who's there to supervise Pierre

1814
01:39:15,107 --> 01:39:18,241
and everything else I told you to do?

1815
01:39:19,377 --> 01:39:21,176
There's no one...

1816
01:39:21,178 --> 01:39:24,445
Not one human being I can rely on.

1817
01:39:26,782 --> 01:39:30,649
You came here against my express orders.

1818
01:39:30,651 --> 01:39:33,184
Yes, against your orders...

1819
01:39:33,186 --> 01:39:36,187
Because my grandmother died.

1820
01:39:36,189 --> 01:39:39,022
Was that against your orders, too?

1821
01:39:40,191 --> 01:39:43,058
Francoise, why didn't you tell me?

1822
01:39:43,060 --> 01:39:45,060
You knew I was here.

1823
01:39:45,062 --> 01:39:47,462
We could have been together.

1824
01:39:48,398 --> 01:39:49,463
Come here.

1825
01:39:54,269 --> 01:39:55,501
Francoise?

1826
01:40:03,610 --> 01:40:07,678
I want to stay here in
Paris with the children.

1827
01:40:07,680 --> 01:40:09,946
Yes?

1828
01:40:09,948 --> 01:40:11,681
Without you.

1829
01:40:11,683 --> 01:40:14,083
Just for a time.

1830
01:40:17,221 --> 01:40:19,287
Is there someone else?

1831
01:40:20,823 --> 01:40:23,323
No. There's no one else.

1832
01:40:23,325 --> 01:40:25,958
Is that all you can think of?

1833
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:27,492
All right, if there's no one else,

1834
01:40:27,494 --> 01:40:28,493
you must...

1835
01:40:28,495 --> 01:40:29,827
Stay here.

1836
01:40:29,829 --> 01:40:31,628
I need you.

1837
01:40:34,232 --> 01:40:37,233
If that were true, I would stay,

1838
01:40:37,235 --> 01:40:39,435
but I know that it's not.

1839
01:41:09,934 --> 01:41:12,301
It's that friend of yours, Genevieve...

1840
01:41:12,303 --> 01:41:14,536
Putting these ideas in your head.

1841
01:41:14,538 --> 01:41:15,670
Why is she here?

1842
01:41:15,672 --> 01:41:18,105
Who called her to make you
even more hysterical?

1843
01:41:18,107 --> 01:41:20,607
How do you know she's here?

1844
01:41:33,888 --> 01:41:39,390
I suppose it wouldn't make any
difference to you if I left.

1845
01:41:39,392 --> 01:41:41,692
People come and people go.

1846
01:41:41,694 --> 01:41:46,296
And you will always stay,
under all circumstances?

1847
01:41:46,298 --> 01:41:49,499
I stay. That's my life.

1848
01:41:49,501 --> 01:41:51,400
I stay.

1849
01:41:54,171 --> 01:41:57,472
And what a life for me and my wife,

1850
01:41:57,474 --> 01:41:59,340
but most people don't
even know I have a wife.

1851
01:41:59,342 --> 01:42:00,874
We even have a place of our own,

1852
01:42:00,876 --> 01:42:03,476
where he sometimes permits me
to spend a few hours.

1853
01:42:03,478 --> 01:42:05,377
Don't ask me what sort of a place...

1854
01:42:05,379 --> 01:42:09,580
what sort of a garret we can
afford on the salary he pays me.

1855
01:42:09,582 --> 01:42:11,381
And there are my other expenses as well,

1856
01:42:11,383 --> 01:42:12,849
like when he summons me to vallauris...

1857
01:42:12,851 --> 01:42:17,385
paying my own fare, of course,
my own train ticket.

1858
01:42:17,387 --> 01:42:19,186
Third class.

1859
01:42:21,657 --> 01:42:24,057
And his promises...

1860
01:42:27,195 --> 01:42:29,228
His promises.

1861
01:42:29,230 --> 01:42:31,463
In 1901 he painted my portrait.

1862
01:42:31,465 --> 01:42:33,264
He said, "this is yours,
my present to you,"

1863
01:42:33,266 --> 01:42:36,734
and when I asked him for it, he'd given
it away to a cabaret in Barcelona.

1864
01:42:36,736 --> 01:42:40,104
For 50 years he's been painting my
portrait, and always, "this is yours,"

1865
01:42:40,106 --> 01:42:44,541
and always I have to
remind him and beg for it.

1866
01:42:44,543 --> 01:42:46,142
Beg like a dog...

1867
01:42:46,144 --> 01:42:48,444
But still I stay.

1868
01:42:48,446 --> 01:42:50,078
But why?

1869
01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:51,412
Because if I left,

1870
01:42:51,414 --> 01:42:52,780
every time I came here
I'd have to ring the bell

1871
01:42:52,782 --> 01:42:54,815
and be admitted by some
other idiot of a sabartes

1872
01:42:54,817 --> 01:42:57,250
and wait just like everyone else
for my crumb of friendship.

1873
01:42:57,252 --> 01:42:59,685
Besides, if I'm not here,
he has to look around,

1874
01:42:59,687 --> 01:43:03,254
"Where the hell is sabartes?"

1875
01:43:03,256 --> 01:43:06,523
With me by his side...

1876
01:43:06,525 --> 01:43:10,492
He doesn't need to think about me.

1877
01:43:12,262 --> 01:43:15,729
Even Olga was lyrical and serene.

1878
01:43:15,731 --> 01:43:17,464
When was this?

1879
01:43:17,466 --> 01:43:18,698
1917.

1880
01:43:18,700 --> 01:43:21,300
1917.

1881
01:43:21,302 --> 01:43:23,635
A few years later, she's a monster.

1882
01:43:23,637 --> 01:43:28,038
A monster mouth,
full of jagged teeth, to bite,

1883
01:43:28,040 --> 01:43:30,040
and a tongue to nag and nag and nag.

1884
01:43:30,042 --> 01:43:33,276
Then there's dora.

1885
01:43:33,278 --> 01:43:37,179
What could I do about dora?

1886
01:43:37,181 --> 01:43:40,382
It wasn't sadism, it was, a...

1887
01:43:40,384 --> 01:43:44,618
A vision of hers imposed itself on me.

1888
01:43:45,921 --> 01:43:50,956
Only francoise the flower
woman remains herself

1889
01:43:50,958 --> 01:43:53,525
without being distorted.

1890
01:43:53,527 --> 01:43:56,794
It is she who has distorted me.

1891
01:44:02,935 --> 01:44:04,668
I'll show you. Look.

1892
01:44:08,240 --> 01:44:11,574
It is a cockerel lying bound to a table

1893
01:44:11,576 --> 01:44:13,976
with a knife that has
just cut its throat.

1894
01:44:13,978 --> 01:44:17,546
It's dripping blood into a bowl.

1895
01:44:17,548 --> 01:44:20,881
I am that cockerel with his throat cut...

1896
01:44:23,151 --> 01:44:25,650
And she is the knife.

1897
01:44:27,453 --> 01:44:31,521
This is her latest. She's going
to leave me, abandon me.

1898
01:44:31,523 --> 01:44:34,423
It's all right. I can speak
out before kahnweiler.

1899
01:44:34,425 --> 01:44:35,991
He's my friend.

1900
01:44:35,993 --> 01:44:38,526
He has feeling for me.

1901
01:44:38,528 --> 01:44:42,263
She's dreaming of some
mythical life of her own,

1902
01:44:42,265 --> 01:44:45,766
as if she could ever
have one apart from me.

1903
01:44:45,768 --> 01:44:51,304
You think people will care
this much for your work?

1904
01:44:51,306 --> 01:44:55,774
You have a schoolgirl's facility.

1905
01:44:55,776 --> 01:44:57,942
That's all.

1906
01:45:02,114 --> 01:45:03,713
The day you leave...

1907
01:45:03,715 --> 01:45:09,017
That day kahnweiler will
cancel his contract with you.

1908
01:45:09,019 --> 01:45:13,021
Because you will tell him to.

1909
01:45:33,008 --> 01:45:35,074
Dora.

1910
01:45:35,076 --> 01:45:36,475
Do you remember me?

1911
01:45:36,477 --> 01:45:39,845
You've changed.

1912
01:45:39,847 --> 01:45:42,681
I knew you would.

1913
01:45:42,683 --> 01:45:44,816
Picasso is an agent of change,

1914
01:45:44,818 --> 01:45:48,986
a catalyst to blow everything
inside you to bits.

1915
01:45:48,988 --> 01:45:50,287
Yes, if you let him.

1916
01:45:50,289 --> 01:45:53,923
This is my friend Genevieve
from montpellier.

1917
01:45:53,925 --> 01:45:57,426
You don't look like someone
who lives in Paris.

1918
01:46:01,898 --> 01:46:03,163
And you...

1919
01:46:03,165 --> 01:46:05,732
You look like someone

1920
01:46:05,734 --> 01:46:09,335
who's been breathing in the
air of Picasso's studio.

1921
01:46:09,337 --> 01:46:11,503
Peculiar air.

1922
01:46:11,505 --> 01:46:13,838
Sometimes it seems like poison gas,

1923
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:16,707
but then you find you can't
breathe in any other.

1924
01:46:16,709 --> 01:46:19,910
That is not at all
the case with francoise.

1925
01:46:23,181 --> 01:46:25,681
I don't like cats,

1926
01:46:25,683 --> 01:46:30,284
but when my dog died, he gave me a cat.

1927
01:46:30,286 --> 01:46:32,452
I still have it.

1928
01:46:32,454 --> 01:46:35,588
It's called moumoune.

1929
01:46:35,590 --> 01:46:38,891
He gave it that name.

1930
01:46:38,893 --> 01:46:41,660
It's a very vicious cat.

1931
01:46:41,662 --> 01:46:42,927
Look.

1932
01:46:45,731 --> 01:46:47,731
He'll leave you when he's ready.

1933
01:46:47,733 --> 01:46:52,001
Even then, you won't be free of him,

1934
01:46:52,003 --> 01:46:58,139
and after him, without
him, there is nothing.

1935
01:46:58,141 --> 01:47:01,375
After Picasso...

1936
01:47:01,377 --> 01:47:04,511
Only God.

1937
01:47:07,782 --> 01:47:10,082
And moumoune...

1938
01:47:12,486 --> 01:47:16,020
That cat just won't die.

1939
01:47:49,455 --> 01:47:52,355
You think anyone will care
this much for you?

1940
01:47:52,357 --> 01:47:55,858
You have no existence apart from me.

1941
01:47:55,860 --> 01:47:57,893
Without me, you are nothing.

1942
01:47:57,895 --> 01:48:01,062
People will see you as nothing.

1943
01:48:01,064 --> 01:48:03,431
They'll forget you.

1944
01:48:06,569 --> 01:48:09,903
I'm having a heart attack.

1945
01:48:09,905 --> 01:48:13,139
It's your fault.

1946
01:48:13,141 --> 01:48:14,940
Call Paulo.

1947
01:48:21,280 --> 01:48:23,513
Paulo.

1948
01:48:40,898 --> 01:48:42,631
Why?

1949
01:48:43,567 --> 01:48:47,268
Why do you leave me
alone with this woman?

1950
01:48:47,270 --> 01:48:49,703
Look what she's done to me.

1951
01:48:49,705 --> 01:48:51,738
Call Dr. Gutmann.

1952
01:48:51,740 --> 01:48:54,507
It's too late for the doctor.

1953
01:48:54,509 --> 01:48:57,942
I never want to see you again.

1954
01:48:57,944 --> 01:49:00,277
Go! Get out!

1955
01:49:00,279 --> 01:49:02,746
Get... get out.

1956
01:49:05,183 --> 01:49:06,782
Papa, please.

1957
01:49:06,784 --> 01:49:09,050
Come on, for my sake.

1958
01:49:12,355 --> 01:49:15,356
All you need is peace and quiet.

1959
01:49:15,358 --> 01:49:18,325
Nothing is worth it.

1960
01:49:18,327 --> 01:49:20,693
No one wants another episode.

1961
01:49:23,197 --> 01:49:24,829
See what she's doing?

1962
01:49:24,831 --> 01:49:29,199
Tell her we're...
we're going to vallauris.

1963
01:49:29,201 --> 01:49:31,434
Tell her she can come with us.

1964
01:49:31,436 --> 01:49:34,236
Put jacqueline on the train.

1965
01:49:34,238 --> 01:49:37,072
Why don't you pick some
of your favorite toys

1966
01:49:37,074 --> 01:49:40,542
and put them in this basket for me?

1967
01:49:47,717 --> 01:49:51,085
Papa says we're going back
to vallauris today,

1968
01:49:51,087 --> 01:49:55,689
and he wants you and the
children to come with us.

1969
01:49:55,691 --> 01:49:57,857
I'll drive very carefully.

1970
01:49:59,093 --> 01:50:01,493
Please come.

1971
01:50:01,495 --> 01:50:03,695
He'd like it.

1972
01:50:03,697 --> 01:50:05,463
I'd like it, too.

1973
01:50:05,465 --> 01:50:07,898
It's not the same without you.

1974
01:50:07,900 --> 01:50:12,802
Claude, why don't you go
and see if the car's here?

1975
01:50:14,806 --> 01:50:18,841
Paulo, I only want some time to myself.

1976
01:50:18,843 --> 01:50:21,844
I'll bring the children
during their summer holidays.

1977
01:50:21,846 --> 01:50:26,448
Until then, I'm going to stay in Paris.

1978
01:50:26,450 --> 01:50:28,983
Let's call it an experiment.

1979
01:50:28,985 --> 01:50:32,019
You're lucky you can
make such an experiment.

1980
01:50:32,021 --> 01:50:34,921
Well, so could you if you wanted to.

1981
01:50:34,923 --> 01:50:36,389
What can I do?

1982
01:50:36,391 --> 01:50:39,458
You've heard papa say often
enough how useless I am.

1983
01:50:39,460 --> 01:50:41,593
Yes, I've heard him say it,

1984
01:50:41,595 --> 01:50:45,196
but I don't believe it,
and neither should you.

1985
01:50:45,198 --> 01:50:49,366
I'd drive you if he'd
let me have the car.

1986
01:50:49,368 --> 01:50:51,468
It's all right.

1987
01:50:51,470 --> 01:50:53,269
My father sent his car,

1988
01:50:53,271 --> 01:50:57,840
but you could help me with
these bags if you want to.

1989
01:51:20,730 --> 01:51:23,963
You'll come running back in a week.

1990
01:51:25,833 --> 01:51:27,899
You really believe that?

1991
01:51:27,901 --> 01:51:30,635
No one leaves a man like Picasso.

1992
01:51:33,840 --> 01:51:39,310
I don't think you know
the first thing about me.

1993
01:51:44,183 --> 01:51:47,817
Won't you say good-bye
to the children?

1994
01:52:12,810 --> 01:52:15,343
Mademoiselle?
Is she in the house?

1995
01:52:15,345 --> 01:52:16,544
Mademoiselle is not here.

1996
01:52:16,546 --> 01:52:18,078
But is it true she's left Picasso?

1997
01:52:18,080 --> 01:52:19,546
Is she staying in Paris permanently?

1998
01:52:19,548 --> 01:52:20,580
What about the children?

1999
01:52:20,582 --> 01:52:21,714
She's not in.

2000
01:52:21,716 --> 01:52:22,981
Wait, wait.

2001
01:52:22,983 --> 01:52:24,415
Hey, what's your name?

2002
01:52:24,417 --> 01:52:25,749
Claude.

2003
01:52:25,751 --> 01:52:27,684
That's a nice name,
Claude what? Claude Picasso?

2004
01:52:27,686 --> 01:52:29,185
Where's your mom?

2005
01:52:29,187 --> 01:52:30,985
Wait, wait.

2006
01:52:33,189 --> 01:52:34,388
No more questions!

2007
01:52:34,390 --> 01:52:35,889
Wait!

2008
01:52:44,132 --> 01:52:45,698
Didn't you say you couldn't leave him,

2009
01:52:45,700 --> 01:52:48,033
he's an historical monument?

2010
01:52:48,035 --> 01:52:50,635
Why are you and the child...

2011
01:52:50,637 --> 01:52:51,769
historical monument?

2012
01:52:51,771 --> 01:52:54,338
Are you going back to visit him?

2013
01:52:54,340 --> 01:52:57,574
She is taking the children
to visit their father.

2014
01:52:57,576 --> 01:53:00,109
Is that so difficult to understand?

2015
01:53:00,111 --> 01:53:02,611
4, 5, 6,

2016
01:53:02,613 --> 01:53:05,547
7, 8, 9, 10.

2017
01:53:05,549 --> 01:53:08,483
1, 2, 3,

2018
01:53:08,485 --> 01:53:10,251
4, 5,

2019
01:53:10,253 --> 01:53:13,354
6, 7, 8,

2020
01:53:13,356 --> 01:53:15,389
9, 10, 11,

2021
01:53:15,391 --> 01:53:17,090
12, 13, 14,

2022
01:53:17,092 --> 01:53:19,725
15.

2023
01:53:19,727 --> 01:53:21,960
Good. Fine.

2024
01:53:38,611 --> 01:53:41,378
Somebody changed these hooks.

2025
01:53:41,380 --> 01:53:42,980
Yes, I did,

2026
01:53:42,982 --> 01:53:45,281
to make it fit me.

2027
01:53:47,585 --> 01:53:50,085
He told me to wear it.

2028
01:53:50,087 --> 01:53:52,020
He said he had given it to you,

2029
01:53:52,022 --> 01:53:54,155
that it was a present from him.

2030
01:53:54,157 --> 01:53:57,158
So it was perfectly all right
for him to give it to you.

2031
01:53:57,160 --> 01:53:58,726
That sounds familiar.

2032
01:53:58,728 --> 01:54:01,628
Well, you left him.

2033
01:54:01,630 --> 01:54:04,330
And you stepped in very fast.

2034
01:54:04,332 --> 01:54:05,264
Yes,

2035
01:54:05,266 --> 01:54:07,366
and now I am here to look after him

2036
01:54:07,368 --> 01:54:10,402
to serve him with the last
breath in my body.

2037
01:54:10,404 --> 01:54:13,571
Be careful. He may
take you at your word.

2038
01:54:13,573 --> 01:54:17,141
He loves to turn his
friends into his slaves.

2039
01:54:17,143 --> 01:54:22,111
I don't care this much for myself.

2040
01:54:22,113 --> 01:54:25,547
I'm here for him, and for him alone.

2041
01:54:30,753 --> 01:54:32,986
I'm making a whole series,

2042
01:54:32,988 --> 01:54:35,788
all about a ludicrous little painter

2043
01:54:35,790 --> 01:54:39,690
and his gloriously beautiful young model.

2044
01:54:39,692 --> 01:54:43,060
He loves her. She despises him.

2045
01:54:43,062 --> 01:54:44,628
Why shouldn't she?

2046
01:54:44,630 --> 01:54:48,031
He's only an ugly old monster.

2047
01:54:48,033 --> 01:54:51,100
I'm giving her a pet
monkey to kiss and fondle

2048
01:54:51,102 --> 01:54:55,003
and make the little old
man sick with jealousy.

2049
01:54:56,473 --> 01:54:59,040
Doesn't it make you laugh?

2050
01:54:59,042 --> 01:55:02,910
Yes, it's funny.

2051
01:55:02,912 --> 01:55:05,646
So funny, it makes me weep.

2052
01:55:05,648 --> 01:55:07,781
Why should you weep?

2053
01:55:07,783 --> 01:55:10,850
It is I who should weep.

2054
01:55:10,852 --> 01:55:14,886
What wouldn't I give to be like you.

2055
01:55:14,888 --> 01:55:17,989
30 years old, even 40.

2056
01:55:17,991 --> 01:55:20,391
Settle for 40,

2057
01:55:20,393 --> 01:55:25,362
but in these matters, there's
no one to make a deal with.

2058
01:55:25,364 --> 01:55:29,265
There's been no fun
in my life since you left.

2059
01:55:29,267 --> 01:55:32,034
No one makes me laugh anymore.

2060
01:55:32,036 --> 01:55:34,536
I suppose you're having
all the fun in Paris.

2061
01:55:35,539 --> 01:55:36,539
Yeah.

2062
01:55:37,941 --> 01:55:39,106
Is someone listening?

2063
01:55:39,108 --> 01:55:41,475
No. Hinge needs oiling.

2064
01:55:41,477 --> 01:55:44,077
See, no one does anything since you left.

2065
01:55:44,079 --> 01:55:45,912
Why don't you come back?

2066
01:55:46,781 --> 01:55:48,580
I didn't call you.

2067
01:55:48,582 --> 01:55:52,182
I... I brought some more
kindling for the stove.

2068
01:55:52,184 --> 01:55:53,650
Well, leave it there.

2069
01:55:53,652 --> 01:55:54,784
I'll wait, monseigneur.

2070
01:55:54,786 --> 01:55:58,087
I'll call you when I need you.

2071
01:56:03,027 --> 01:56:05,961
"Monseigneur," no less?

2072
01:56:05,963 --> 01:56:09,964
Jacqueline treats me with proper respect.

2073
01:56:09,966 --> 01:56:11,498
Not like you.

2074
01:56:11,500 --> 01:56:15,335
For you, respect means to be your slave.

2075
01:56:15,337 --> 01:56:17,670
You were glad enough
to be that when you loved me.

2076
01:56:17,672 --> 01:56:19,038
Yes, when I loved you.

2077
01:56:19,040 --> 01:56:21,507
I was a slave to love, not to you.

2078
01:56:21,509 --> 01:56:24,576
You think you can throw
a life away just like that?

2079
01:56:24,578 --> 01:56:26,177
All these years.

2080
01:56:26,179 --> 01:56:28,312
Our cup full of memories.

2081
01:56:28,314 --> 01:56:31,315
That you and I have drunk together?

2082
01:56:31,317 --> 01:56:33,183
Francoise.

2083
01:56:33,185 --> 01:56:35,084
No.

2084
01:56:35,086 --> 01:56:38,653
All right. At least
let's be friends.

2085
01:56:39,722 --> 01:56:41,455
I want you to do something for me.

2086
01:56:41,457 --> 01:56:42,456
What is it?

2087
01:56:42,458 --> 01:56:43,557
I want...

2088
01:56:43,559 --> 01:56:46,259
if I don't stoke it now,
the stove will go out.

2089
01:56:46,261 --> 01:56:47,526
All right, do it, then.

2090
01:56:47,528 --> 01:56:50,529
Yes, they're having
a bullfight in my honor

2091
01:56:50,531 --> 01:56:54,466
in vallauris on the 30th, and...

2092
01:56:54,468 --> 01:56:58,369
I want you to perform the opening
ceremony for me on horseback.

2093
01:56:58,371 --> 01:57:00,838
But I don't have a
trained horse down here.

2094
01:57:00,840 --> 01:57:02,873
We'll find one for you in nice.

2095
01:57:02,875 --> 01:57:03,874
That's impossible.

2096
01:57:03,876 --> 01:57:05,642
Why?

2097
01:57:05,644 --> 01:57:08,478
Francoise mustn't ride into the arena
to open the bullfight, she can't.

2098
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:09,479
Why not?

2099
01:57:09,481 --> 01:57:11,714
It's immoral.

2100
01:57:11,716 --> 01:57:13,749
What will the newspapers say?

2101
01:57:13,751 --> 01:57:16,051
Let the papers say what they want,

2102
01:57:16,053 --> 01:57:18,520
and I'll do what I want.

2103
01:57:20,891 --> 01:57:24,525
Of course you are right.
I was stupid.

2104
01:57:32,300 --> 01:57:34,566
Monseigneur.

2105
01:57:34,568 --> 01:57:36,134
Quiet.

2106
01:57:41,007 --> 01:57:47,410
On the whole, I prefer a woman
with not too much sense of humor.

2107
01:57:47,412 --> 01:57:51,780
Yeah..

2108
01:57:51,782 --> 01:57:53,181
Yeah.

2109
01:58:43,265 --> 01:58:47,567
This was my own
personal homage to Picasso.

2110
01:58:47,569 --> 01:58:51,570
Our children, our years together...

2111
01:58:51,572 --> 01:58:55,674
for all I'd learned from being with him.

2112
01:58:55,676 --> 01:59:03,148
Now, at 74, he was starting a new
life with, of course, a new woman.

2113
01:59:11,357 --> 01:59:13,757
But I was grateful to him for everything,

2114
01:59:13,759 --> 01:59:16,559
and most of all because
he had made me strong...

2115
01:59:16,561 --> 01:59:19,128
strong enough to do anything,

2116
01:59:19,130 --> 01:59:23,132
even to survive 10 years
of living with him.
