1
00:02:10,094 --> 00:02:11,561
Yeah, you know
how pumped they get

2
00:02:11,562 --> 00:02:12,796
over the sports interviews.

3
00:02:12,797 --> 00:02:14,437
- Tom Brady has everything, right?
- Yeah.

4
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,500
So, what Mike Wallace
says to him is...

5
00:02:16,501 --> 00:02:18,334
he says, "here you are,
youngest quarterback

6
00:02:18,335 --> 00:02:19,870
"to ever win three super bowls,
three MVPs,

7
00:02:19,871 --> 00:02:21,338
"absolute top
of your profession.

8
00:02:21,339 --> 00:02:23,941
How does it feel to have
all your dreams come true?"

9
00:02:23,942 --> 00:02:25,909
And so he said,
"when it all happened,

10
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,678
"I said to myself,
'is this really it?

11
00:02:27,679 --> 00:02:30,280
There's got to be something
more than this, right?'"

12
00:02:30,281 --> 00:02:31,917
wow. That hit you,
clearly, big.

13
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:33,484
What are you doing?

14
00:02:33,485 --> 00:02:34,785
Getting a granola bar.

15
00:02:34,786 --> 00:02:37,221
You're stealing a granola bar.
We haven't bought these yet.

16
00:02:37,222 --> 00:02:38,755
- Can I have a piece?
- I'm not stealing it.

17
00:02:38,756 --> 00:02:40,691
- She's not stealing it.
- Mom would let me have it.

18
00:02:40,692 --> 00:02:42,692
- You're gonna buy them.
- Mom would let you do this?

19
00:02:42,693 --> 00:02:44,928
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm gonna have a little chat with mom.

20
00:02:44,929 --> 00:02:46,563
- You just go and you...
- I'm not stealing it.

21
00:02:46,564 --> 00:02:48,798
You are eating something
you haven't paid for yet.

22
00:02:48,799 --> 00:02:50,267
- Come on.
- That's kind of like...

23
00:02:50,268 --> 00:02:52,335
if you look up what stealing is,
that's what stealing is.

24
00:02:52,336 --> 00:02:55,539
She was just about to take
a shot, and then she threw up.

25
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,475
Oh, my God. And you weren't
there to see this one?

26
00:02:58,476 --> 00:03:00,844
No, no, it's the one
that I missed.

27
00:03:00,845 --> 00:03:02,181
- Wow.
- Get your thing.

28
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,381
- Yeah.
- Man.

29
00:03:03,382 --> 00:03:05,182
I wish... hey, will you
do me a favor

30
00:03:05,183 --> 00:03:07,216
and tell me the next time
someone's gonna barf

31
00:03:07,217 --> 00:03:08,918
- all over the ice?
- Yeah, that would be nice.

32
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:10,355
Hey, when is the funeral?

33
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:11,823
Um, Friday, I think.

34
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:13,025
You think Dave's gonna come?

35
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,591
I don't know, man.

36
00:03:14,592 --> 00:03:16,393
I haven't talked to him.
Have you talked to him at all?

37
00:03:16,394 --> 00:03:17,960
No, I haven't talked to him
in like a year.

38
00:03:17,961 --> 00:03:19,163
You talk to him more than I do.

39
00:03:19,164 --> 00:03:22,132
Sam, pull over here, will you?

40
00:03:22,133 --> 00:03:23,800
All right. Sure.

41
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:26,504
Yeah.
I feel like walking.

42
00:03:26,505 --> 00:03:28,038
Bye, banana head.

43
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:31,208
- Yeah.
- I'll see you later.

44
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:05,042
What do you mean,
you're gonna quit the boat?

45
00:04:05,043 --> 00:04:06,243
What are you gonna do for work?

46
00:04:06,244 --> 00:04:08,547
I don't know.
I'll figure something out.

47
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:11,081
Don't worry about it, mom.

48
00:04:11,082 --> 00:04:13,450
Yeah, okay, I won't,
but I do, all right?

49
00:04:13,451 --> 00:04:15,218
I do worry about it, yeah.

50
00:04:15,219 --> 00:04:17,721
I mean, most people
would have lined up a job

51
00:04:17,722 --> 00:04:20,289
before they even think about
quitting something.

52
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:22,192
Well, you know
I'm not most people.

53
00:04:22,193 --> 00:04:23,392
Yeah, but guess what.

54
00:04:23,393 --> 00:04:25,161
The basement
is rented out, so...

55
00:04:25,162 --> 00:04:26,930
I'm not gonna be
in the basement.

56
00:04:26,931 --> 00:04:28,267
I did that for two weeks.

57
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,167
No. Maybe like two months.

58
00:04:30,168 --> 00:04:32,235
It was two weeks
five years ago.

59
00:04:32,236 --> 00:04:34,007
You haven't stopped
giving me shit about it.

60
00:04:35,007 --> 00:04:37,173
And when does Davey
get to town?

61
00:04:37,174 --> 00:04:39,810
I don't know.
I haven't talked to him.

62
00:04:39,811 --> 00:04:40,611
But I assume soon.

63
00:04:41,012 --> 00:04:43,581
- He's coming.
- I assume he is, yeah.

64
00:04:43,582 --> 00:04:46,551
"I assume."
It's his father's funeral.

65
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:48,051
He's coming, right?

66
00:04:48,052 --> 00:04:49,686
Yes, he's coming.

67
00:04:49,687 --> 00:04:51,255
Okay. Well, then you bring him
around for dinner when he comes.

68
00:04:51,256 --> 00:04:54,424
- Okay. I will.
- Okay. Okay.

69
00:04:54,425 --> 00:04:58,862
That's good.
I sent flowers from us.

70
00:04:58,863 --> 00:05:00,931
- Oh, nice.
- Hi.

71
00:05:00,932 --> 00:05:02,132
Hey, Sara.
How are you?

72
00:05:02,133 --> 00:05:03,332
I'm all right.
How are you?

73
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm sorry I missed the show.
How'd it go?

74
00:05:05,001 --> 00:05:06,202
- Oh, it's all right.
- Yeah?

75
00:05:06,203 --> 00:05:07,738
- I sold one piece, but...
- You did?

76
00:05:07,739 --> 00:05:08,938
- I did.
- Oh, congratulations.

77
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:10,373
- Thank you very much.
- That's awesome.

78
00:05:10,374 --> 00:05:11,774
- I'm good.
- I'm gonna come by.

79
00:05:11,775 --> 00:05:12,976
- You should.
- Yeah.

80
00:05:12,977 --> 00:05:14,510
- See for yourself.
- Friday, right?

81
00:05:14,511 --> 00:05:15,614
You gonna buy something?

82
00:05:16,014 --> 00:05:17,384
- I hope so.
- Uh-huh.

83
00:05:19,384 --> 00:05:20,785
What?

84
00:05:20,786 --> 00:05:23,820
- She is a sweet girl, that Sara.
- I know she's a sweet girl.

85
00:05:23,821 --> 00:05:25,122
- Yeah, she is.
- Yep, she is.

86
00:05:25,123 --> 00:05:27,091
- She has a cute ass, too.
- Oh, my God.

87
00:05:27,092 --> 00:05:28,626
- What?
- Seriously.

88
00:05:28,627 --> 00:05:31,094
- What? I'm just saying.
- Will you stop, please?

89
00:05:31,095 --> 00:05:32,995
I'm not... what?
I'm just saying that...

90
00:05:32,996 --> 00:05:34,664
will you stop checking out
girls' asses?

91
00:05:34,665 --> 00:05:36,500
You're the checker-outer-er,
whatever.

92
00:05:36,501 --> 00:05:38,067
- I got to go.
- Anyway, I just...

93
00:05:38,068 --> 00:05:40,503
you know, I would like to have
a grandchild at some point.

94
00:05:40,504 --> 00:05:42,171
I know you would. You should
have had more kids, though.

95
00:05:42,172 --> 00:05:43,473
- What do you want me to do?
- I know.

96
00:05:43,474 --> 00:05:44,877
I really should have,
maybe 5, 10, 20.

97
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:46,076
Right. Exactly.

98
00:05:46,077 --> 00:05:47,379
Where are you going?

99
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,313
You know where I'm going.

100
00:05:49,314 --> 00:05:51,550
- I told you.
- Oh, right. Be happy.

101
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:53,885
You're hilarious.

102
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:56,187
- I love you.
- Love you, too.

103
00:06:07,064 --> 00:06:09,800
Okay, okay, we're gonna
do the chicken dance.

104
00:06:09,801 --> 00:06:11,868
You guys remember
the chicken dance?

105
00:06:11,869 --> 00:06:13,135
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Okay.

106
00:06:13,136 --> 00:06:14,771
You know Chet.
That's his favorite.

107
00:06:14,772 --> 00:06:17,408
Let's get in...
hands right in there like that.

108
00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:18,677
Yep...

109
00:06:20,512 --> 00:06:23,915
Really make eye contact
with each other, guys.

110
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,818
Everybody!

111
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:27,619
Everybody, drop!

112
00:06:29,687 --> 00:06:33,191
Let's get together
to do the chain gang, okay?

113
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:35,558
Get your head
on someone's stomach, everybody,

114
00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:38,630
and then someone's gonna
put their head on your stomach.

115
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:39,830
Here we go. Ha!

116
00:06:39,831 --> 00:06:41,732
- Ha ha.
- Ha ha.

117
00:06:41,733 --> 00:06:42,934
Ha ha.

118
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:45,872
Ha ha.

119
00:06:47,872 --> 00:06:50,976
Get in that belly.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

120
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:58,616
If you start doing it, you'll
start feeling it, right? Right?

121
00:06:58,617 --> 00:07:00,918
That's it, guys.
That's it.

122
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,889
Very nice.

123
00:07:06,091 --> 00:07:08,123
That was terrific.
I love you guys.

124
00:07:08,124 --> 00:07:11,497
You guys are so great.
There's so much love in here.

125
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:14,064
I love it.
Thank you. Thank you.

126
00:07:14,065 --> 00:07:18,736
Good job... our new...
our new people, too, today.

127
00:07:18,737 --> 00:07:21,405
Really good work.
Really good work.

128
00:07:21,406 --> 00:07:26,076
Bye, guys. We'll see you
next week. Thank you.

129
00:07:26,077 --> 00:07:27,677
Oh!

130
00:07:27,678 --> 00:07:30,881
You're so great.

131
00:07:30,882 --> 00:07:32,183
Hey.

132
00:07:32,184 --> 00:07:33,382
- Hi.
- How are you?

133
00:07:33,383 --> 00:07:35,252
- Oh, my God.
- So good to see you.

134
00:07:35,253 --> 00:07:36,786
I'm so surprised to see you.

135
00:07:36,787 --> 00:07:39,055
That was fun.
You're a great teacher.

136
00:07:39,056 --> 00:07:40,259
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

137
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,260
It's... yay.

138
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:44,761
So fun.
Thank you so much again.

139
00:07:44,762 --> 00:07:46,663
Thank you, Theresa. It's always
so great to see you.

140
00:07:46,664 --> 00:07:47,664
You have a good day.

141
00:07:47,665 --> 00:07:49,701
- See you.
- Your people love you.

142
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:50,902
Oh.

143
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:52,437
No, I mean, you really seem like
the people really...

144
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:54,072
- Hey.
- Hey.

145
00:08:03,682 --> 00:08:06,115
- How are you?
- It's so good to see you.

146
00:08:06,116 --> 00:08:08,050
It is really good to see you.

147
00:08:08,051 --> 00:08:10,322
- Yeah.
- That trip was... was long.

148
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,556
Yeah, a few weeks.

149
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:13,125
- It was amazing.
- Yeah?

150
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:16,494
We took alpacas, like,
down the mountains and...

151
00:08:16,495 --> 00:08:18,162
but just the whole time,

152
00:08:18,163 --> 00:08:22,134
all I could think of was the
laughter that I brought with me

153
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:24,302
really just affected everyone.

154
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:26,304
It just made a great trip.

155
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:27,938
- Chet has come a long way.
- Really?

156
00:08:27,939 --> 00:08:30,507
When he came in here, just...
he was a sourpuss.

157
00:08:30,508 --> 00:08:32,043
- You're kidding me.
- Yeah.

158
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:33,411
This guy?

159
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:35,047
- Yeah. Wouldn't believe it, right?
- This guy.

160
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:36,446
This is Jon.

161
00:08:36,447 --> 00:08:38,817
Yeah. I already laid
on your belly, so...

162
00:08:39,817 --> 00:08:42,185
Beautiful.
It's a beautiful thing.

163
00:08:42,186 --> 00:08:44,255
It was so good
to see you again.

164
00:08:44,256 --> 00:08:45,623
Yeah. Cool.

165
00:08:45,624 --> 00:08:48,090
- Great to see you.
- Well, it's good seeing you.

166
00:08:48,091 --> 00:08:49,595
Yeah, nice to meet you.

167
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:51,629
Have a good night.

168
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,298
- I'm glad you liked it.
- It was fun.

169
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:54,965
It was a lot of fun.

170
00:08:54,966 --> 00:08:56,666
I thought maybe you were gonna
be a little freaked out by it.

171
00:08:56,667 --> 00:08:58,669
Oh, I was completely
freaked out by it, but...

172
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,104
It was cool.

173
00:09:00,105 --> 00:09:01,304
- You did good.
- Really?

174
00:09:01,305 --> 00:09:02,707
- Yeah.
- I was terrible.

175
00:09:03,841 --> 00:09:05,344
I had fun the other night,
too, hanging out.

176
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:07,845
That was fun,
wasn't it? Yeah.

177
00:09:07,846 --> 00:09:09,412
Yeah.
I mean... hi.

178
00:09:09,413 --> 00:09:11,619
- Um, yeah, it was cool.
- Yeah.

179
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:15,786
Do you meditate ever?

180
00:09:15,787 --> 00:09:17,955
Uh, no.

181
00:09:17,956 --> 00:09:21,291
I've always wanted to, but
I just haven't had the time.

182
00:09:21,292 --> 00:09:22,292
You haven't had the time?

183
00:09:24,229 --> 00:09:25,998
- My life's very busy.
- Yeah.

184
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:29,566
- Yeah.
- Come on.

185
00:09:29,567 --> 00:09:30,901
What?

186
00:09:30,902 --> 00:09:32,236
- Right now?
- Yeah.

187
00:09:32,237 --> 00:09:34,839
We gonna meditate now?

188
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,839
- Yeah.
- Okay.

189
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,409
Just leave your car.
We'll take mine.

190
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,378
Oh. All right.

191
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:42,647
Did you have trouble finding...

192
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:44,580
It's not an openness
like sleeping around.

193
00:09:44,581 --> 00:09:45,381
It's just an openness
with your partner,

194
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:48,820
just being completely honest
about everything.

195
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:50,220
Like, everything?

196
00:09:50,221 --> 00:09:53,323
Yeah, everything, you know, any
desires or impulses, anything...

197
00:09:53,324 --> 00:09:55,057
you know,
you're attracted to somebody,

198
00:09:55,058 --> 00:09:57,826
you tell them instead
of not... not telling them.

199
00:09:57,827 --> 00:10:00,162
It's just keeping it open
and honest,

200
00:10:00,163 --> 00:10:01,730
a communication, basically.

201
00:10:01,731 --> 00:10:03,700
So, do they get annoyed
if you're constantly, like,

202
00:10:03,701 --> 00:10:05,234
telling them, like,
"that person's hot"?

203
00:10:05,235 --> 00:10:06,869
No, because I don't do that.

204
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:09,638
I'm not like, "oh, that guy's
so hot," you know?

205
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:11,474
- I'm still respectful.
- Right.

206
00:10:11,475 --> 00:10:13,977
And I do it more
out of honoring that person.

207
00:10:13,978 --> 00:10:17,313
If I feel it's important enough
to say something, I will.

208
00:10:17,314 --> 00:10:19,081
- Right.
- But you really think hard

209
00:10:19,082 --> 00:10:21,316
about if you actually do
want to sleep with that person.

210
00:10:21,317 --> 00:10:23,585
- Right.
- 'Cause you're gonna tell them about it.

211
00:10:23,586 --> 00:10:24,423
- Sure.
- You know?

212
00:10:25,023 --> 00:10:26,555
But what if it, like,
happens spontaneously and...

213
00:10:26,556 --> 00:10:28,090
you can't really do that,
right,

214
00:10:28,091 --> 00:10:30,261
'cause you got to
tell the other person?

215
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:31,595
Yeah, that's...

216
00:10:31,596 --> 00:10:33,365
you know,
there's some loopholes.

217
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:34,764
No.

218
00:10:34,765 --> 00:10:37,801
No, I mean, it's...
if it happens, it happens,

219
00:10:37,802 --> 00:10:40,670
and then you can
talk about it afterwards,

220
00:10:40,671 --> 00:10:42,238
- you know, too, but...
- Yeah.

221
00:10:42,239 --> 00:10:45,208
When you call them from the
other person's, like, bedroom?

222
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:46,709
"I'm here.
It's looking good.

223
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,478
I feel like
it's gonna happen."

224
00:10:48,479 --> 00:10:49,279
Does that work out?

225
00:10:50,014 --> 00:10:52,348
No. Somehow,
it hasn't happened like that.

226
00:10:52,349 --> 00:10:53,650
You know, it's not like

227
00:10:53,651 --> 00:10:55,118
I'm walking around
with my pants down.

228
00:10:55,119 --> 00:10:56,753
Like, I'm not trying to get laid
all the time, you know?

229
00:10:56,754 --> 00:10:58,220
Right. Sure.
Yeah. No. No. No.

230
00:10:58,221 --> 00:11:01,690
So, how many people
have you been with at one time?

231
00:11:01,691 --> 00:11:02,531
- At one time?
- Yeah.

232
00:11:03,028 --> 00:11:05,261
- Like...
- No, no, no, not like...

233
00:11:05,262 --> 00:11:06,465
how many guys?
Next.

234
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:07,965
Yeah, exactly.

235
00:11:07,966 --> 00:11:10,599
No, but, like, how many people
have you dated at once?

236
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,070
- I think two.
- Oh, yeah?

237
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:13,838
Yeah.

238
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,273
And they both
knew about each other?

239
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:16,474
Yeah.

240
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:18,208
Yeah. And they were cool
with it?

241
00:11:18,209 --> 00:11:19,575
- Yeah.
- That's awesome.

242
00:11:19,576 --> 00:11:21,277
I've... I've been
at the point where I'm like,

243
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:23,813
"I really care about both
of these people," you know?

244
00:11:23,814 --> 00:11:26,248
Yeah, no, I mean, I love all
this because, like, for me,

245
00:11:26,249 --> 00:11:28,618
I've never felt right
in any kind of normal,

246
00:11:28,619 --> 00:11:30,487
structured relationship,
you know?

247
00:11:30,488 --> 00:11:31,887
But I always just thought

248
00:11:31,888 --> 00:11:33,890
that there was something wrong
with me, so...

249
00:11:33,891 --> 00:11:35,525
Right. And there's nothing
wrong with you.

250
00:11:35,526 --> 00:11:38,296
You're just being true
to yourself, you know?

251
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:40,330
Right. That's cool.

252
00:11:40,331 --> 00:11:41,532
Yeah, it is.

253
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:43,233
It's a cool way
to look at it. Yeah.

254
00:11:43,234 --> 00:11:46,770
I don't know if I could handle
it, but it sounds awesome.

255
00:11:46,771 --> 00:11:49,206
Don't know until you try,
you know?

256
00:11:49,207 --> 00:11:50,408
That's true.

257
00:11:52,277 --> 00:11:54,176
- Okay. Enough.
- All right.

258
00:11:54,177 --> 00:11:55,177
- Here we go.
- All right.

259
00:11:56,014 --> 00:11:57,214
Are you ready?

260
00:11:57,215 --> 00:11:58,649
- I am so ready.
- Good.

261
00:11:58,650 --> 00:11:59,850
- Yeah.
- Okay.

262
00:11:59,851 --> 00:12:01,552
Okay, just shake it out.

263
00:12:01,553 --> 00:12:03,488
- Shake it out.
- Bl-bl-bl-bl-bl.

264
00:12:05,389 --> 00:12:07,690
- Okay.
- Just be totally relaxed.

265
00:12:07,691 --> 00:12:10,227
- All right.
- And just put your hands on your knees.

266
00:12:10,228 --> 00:12:11,427
- Okay.
- Okay?

267
00:12:11,428 --> 00:12:12,996
- This is cool.
- That's it.

268
00:12:12,997 --> 00:12:15,632
Okay. I'm gonna close my eyes
with you, so don't worry, okay?

269
00:12:15,633 --> 00:12:17,067
Okay.
That'll help me.

270
00:12:17,068 --> 00:12:18,302
Yes.
Don't worry.

271
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:20,205
- I'm not gonna be staring at you.
- Okay.

272
00:12:23,707 --> 00:12:27,111
Deep breath in.
Deep breath out.

273
00:12:28,846 --> 00:12:33,817
Just focus on your breath,
watching it go in and out.

274
00:12:33,818 --> 00:12:36,653
Just notice your thoughts.

275
00:12:36,654 --> 00:12:38,522
They're just gonna come up,

276
00:12:38,523 --> 00:12:41,027
but you can just watch them
drift by like clouds.

277
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:44,128
Just pass on by.

278
00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:48,331
Okay.
Keep breathing.

279
00:12:48,332 --> 00:12:49,734
Keep your eyes closed.

280
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:51,034
Your eyes are open.

281
00:12:51,035 --> 00:12:53,704
I know, but I'm...
I'm the instructor.

282
00:12:53,705 --> 00:12:55,070
- Oh. Sorry.
- It's okay.

283
00:12:55,071 --> 00:12:56,591
I'm just gonna
put my hand right there.

284
00:12:57,008 --> 00:12:58,210
Okay.
That's good.

285
00:12:58,211 --> 00:13:00,109
Now just... okay.

286
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:02,513
That feels really good.

287
00:13:02,514 --> 00:13:06,316
Good. Good.
Just breathe into it.

288
00:13:06,317 --> 00:13:08,792
Just let it all go.

289
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:15,326
- Jon?
- What?

290
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:17,728
- What are you doing?
- What?

291
00:13:17,729 --> 00:13:19,796
- We're meditating, okay?
- I know. It's awesome.

292
00:13:19,797 --> 00:13:23,366
- I love meditating.
- Okay. Well, it's actually supposed to be

293
00:13:23,367 --> 00:13:24,868
- on your own, okay?
- Oh, okay.

294
00:13:24,869 --> 00:13:26,169
Okay, so...
it's okay.

295
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:28,405
This connection
that we're feeling...

296
00:13:28,406 --> 00:13:29,940
Yeah.

297
00:13:29,941 --> 00:13:31,773
...is great, but it doesn't
always have to be sexual, okay?

298
00:13:31,774 --> 00:13:33,510
Oh, no. Yeah.
No. Absolutely.

299
00:13:33,511 --> 00:13:36,615
Okay, cool.

300
00:14:04,408 --> 00:14:06,042
Thank you.

301
00:14:06,043 --> 00:14:07,878
What's up, man?

302
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:12,181
Your beard.
Look at your beard.

303
00:14:12,182 --> 00:14:14,764
Wow!

304
00:14:26,764 --> 00:14:29,700
- Here. Take this.
- Yeah?

305
00:14:29,701 --> 00:14:31,468
Younger than us,

306
00:14:31,469 --> 00:14:32,269
and he's accomplished more
than any other quarterback

307
00:14:33,004 --> 00:14:34,637
in the history of the game.

308
00:14:34,638 --> 00:14:36,805
So, when Mike Wallace
asked him, like,

309
00:14:36,806 --> 00:14:39,275
how it felt to have
all his dreams come true,

310
00:14:39,276 --> 00:14:42,344
he said he thought to himself,
like, "is this really it?

311
00:14:42,345 --> 00:14:44,980
There's got to be something
more than this."

312
00:14:44,981 --> 00:14:46,715
- Yeah.
- Isn't that crazy?

313
00:14:46,716 --> 00:14:48,884
Like, he's got
a supermodel wife,

314
00:14:48,885 --> 00:14:50,585
he's got four super bowls,

315
00:14:50,586 --> 00:14:51,954
and he's not satisfied
with his life?

316
00:14:51,955 --> 00:14:53,323
No, I get it.
He's a quarterback.

317
00:14:53,324 --> 00:14:54,958
You used to be a quarterback.
You're into it.

318
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,858
No, I mean... it's just...
I don't know.

319
00:14:56,859 --> 00:14:58,227
I thought it was interesting.

320
00:14:58,228 --> 00:15:00,069
What should I fucking care about
tom Brady for?

321
00:15:01,131 --> 00:15:03,432
I don't care about
tom Brady, either.

322
00:15:03,433 --> 00:15:05,102
- I'm just saying.
- The fort!

323
00:15:05,103 --> 00:15:06,135
Yep.

324
00:15:06,136 --> 00:15:07,637
Oh, man,
I can't believe I'm here.

325
00:15:07,638 --> 00:15:09,772
I know. I was surprised
you showed, actually.

326
00:15:09,773 --> 00:15:11,509
I didn't think I was gonna.

327
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,710
Really?

328
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:13,912
I was driving today
to the club.

329
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:17,348
I was like...
"I should go," you know?

330
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:19,349
And I was like... I just fucking
went right to the airport.

331
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:20,983
I got to borrow more shit
from you if I can.

332
00:15:20,984 --> 00:15:23,888
Oh, yeah, you can
borrow whatever you want.

333
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:25,822
It's fucking cold as hell.

334
00:15:25,823 --> 00:15:27,055
- I'll tell you that.
- I know.

335
00:15:27,056 --> 00:15:28,623
Ain't like this
in Vegas, right?

336
00:15:28,624 --> 00:15:30,126
- I'm not there anymore.
- What?

337
00:15:30,127 --> 00:15:31,960
Yeah, I told you that.
I'm in Arizona, in Phoenix.

338
00:15:31,961 --> 00:15:33,262
The last time I talked to you,

339
00:15:33,263 --> 00:15:35,498
you were working
at that casino in Vegas.

340
00:15:35,499 --> 00:15:36,965
No, no, I'm running the club.

341
00:15:36,966 --> 00:15:38,568
- Yeah, heaven.
- I had no idea.

342
00:15:38,569 --> 00:15:39,768
- I told you that.
- No, you didn't.

343
00:15:39,769 --> 00:15:41,103
Yeah, I went there with a girl.

344
00:15:41,104 --> 00:15:42,738
Dude, I haven't talked to you
in four years.

345
00:15:42,739 --> 00:15:44,073
What do you mean,
you told me that?

346
00:15:44,074 --> 00:15:45,710
I was down there
with her. We moved in.

347
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:47,478
Who's the girl?

348
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:48,911
We're not together anymore.

349
00:15:48,912 --> 00:15:50,646
She's just a fucking cunt.

350
00:15:50,647 --> 00:15:52,616
- Let's get high.
- All right.

351
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:57,753
I bet you haven't thought about
Trish Dowling in a while.

352
00:15:57,754 --> 00:15:59,090
She was amazing, man.

353
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:01,691
You had those, man.

354
00:16:01,692 --> 00:16:03,526
- You had them.
- Yes, I did.

355
00:16:03,527 --> 00:16:06,530
How did you get her?
Like, how did that happen?

356
00:16:06,531 --> 00:16:07,797
What did you do?

357
00:16:07,798 --> 00:16:09,732
Did you fucking...
did you bribe her?

358
00:16:09,733 --> 00:16:11,533
- Yeah, I did.
- How did you do that?

359
00:16:11,534 --> 00:16:14,070
What, you don't think my charm
and good looks was enough?

360
00:16:14,071 --> 00:16:15,838
No, I definitely
don't think so, man.

361
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,274
No. She looks good,
though.

362
00:16:17,275 --> 00:16:18,475
Does she?

363
00:16:18,476 --> 00:16:20,177
Who else do you see?

364
00:16:20,178 --> 00:16:22,779
Nobody.
I see, like, Sam.

365
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,748
Right.
He's good?

366
00:16:24,749 --> 00:16:26,984
He's good. He's happy?

367
00:16:26,985 --> 00:16:29,419
I mean,
I wouldn't go that far, but...

368
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:32,121
I just burned the shit
out of my finger.

369
00:16:32,122 --> 00:16:33,790
- You all right?
- Yeah.

370
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,692
- You high?
- I'm really high.

371
00:16:35,693 --> 00:16:37,427
It's good weed, right?

372
00:16:37,428 --> 00:16:38,629
It is good.

373
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,931
Arizona's finest, man.

374
00:16:40,932 --> 00:16:42,034
Arizona's finest.

375
00:16:44,034 --> 00:16:46,235
I see Kate once in a while.

376
00:16:46,236 --> 00:16:47,503
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

377
00:16:47,504 --> 00:16:49,774
- How's she doing?
- She's all right.

378
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:51,808
She got remarried, you know.

379
00:16:51,809 --> 00:16:54,945
Yeah?
Who'd she remarry?

380
00:16:54,946 --> 00:16:59,450
Um, this guy Steve
from Mattapoisett,

381
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:01,618
older guy, like 55.

382
00:17:01,619 --> 00:17:03,153
- 55?
- Yeah.

383
00:17:03,154 --> 00:17:06,890
Wow.

384
00:17:06,891 --> 00:17:09,160
- It's fucking dead.
- Is it tapped out?

385
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:10,360
Yeah.

386
00:17:10,361 --> 00:17:12,262
Do you think that's a little old
for her or what?

387
00:17:12,263 --> 00:17:13,463
What, for her?

388
00:17:13,464 --> 00:17:15,064
Yeah.
Does Sam hate him?

389
00:17:15,065 --> 00:17:16,186
I mean, he doesn't hate him,

390
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,671
but I think it's hard
for Sam, you know?

391
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:21,137
Yeah.

392
00:17:21,138 --> 00:17:24,142
I mean, he's not like dating
anyone else or... you know?

393
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:26,509
Really?
How long has that been?

394
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:30,980
Been like, whatever, five, six
years now, something like that?

395
00:17:30,981 --> 00:17:32,915
- That's too long.
- Yeah.

396
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:35,485
No, we got to take him out
while you're here

397
00:17:35,486 --> 00:17:36,751
and just get him laid.

398
00:17:36,752 --> 00:17:38,890
You guys don't fuck around,
you and Sam?

399
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:43,361
Get the fuck out of here.

400
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:45,962
You still got it?
I still got it.

401
00:17:45,963 --> 00:17:47,764
Get the fuck out of here.

402
00:17:47,765 --> 00:17:49,066
You fuck.

403
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:51,468
You writing a lot?

404
00:17:51,469 --> 00:17:52,935
Yeah. Always.

405
00:17:52,936 --> 00:17:56,008
You know,
always got something going.

406
00:17:57,008 --> 00:17:58,741
- Yep.
- Yeah.

407
00:17:58,742 --> 00:18:00,242
So, you like it out there,
though?

408
00:18:00,243 --> 00:18:02,044
I fucking love it, man.
You got to come over, man.

409
00:18:02,045 --> 00:18:03,979
- You got to come visit.
- No, I want to.

410
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,950
We've been wondering
about you, though.

411
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:09,185
Surprised not to hear from you
for a while.

412
00:18:09,186 --> 00:18:11,220
It's fucking freezing here.

413
00:18:11,221 --> 00:18:13,856
Let's get the fuck out of here.

414
00:18:13,857 --> 00:18:16,193
- Yeah? Come on.
- Yeah, it's freezing.

415
00:18:21,165 --> 00:18:23,865
Right. This is the one
on Windsor terrace.

416
00:18:23,866 --> 00:18:25,636
- Look at him.
- What is he doing?

417
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:27,203
He's in there.

418
00:18:27,204 --> 00:18:28,871
Go through it, and I think
it'll be clear on... right.

419
00:18:28,872 --> 00:18:31,940
No, I think that... I think
it's not gonna be a problem.

420
00:18:31,941 --> 00:18:33,409
It's just...
they just didn't know.

421
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:35,311
- They weren't fully...
- Hey, rose.

422
00:18:35,312 --> 00:18:37,380
They think that we've already
done the inspection, obviously.

423
00:18:37,381 --> 00:18:39,217
And that was just a little bit
of a miscommunication

424
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:40,217
on our part.

425
00:18:40,617 --> 00:18:42,617
And... yeah.

426
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:44,721
Well, no, that's what we can...

427
00:18:44,722 --> 00:18:46,088
look at the suit.

428
00:18:46,089 --> 00:18:47,991
And I'm on your s...
you know, there's been...

429
00:18:49,327 --> 00:18:50,127
no, I think that's something
we can clear up.

430
00:18:51,028 --> 00:18:52,295
- You want us to come back, man?
- I'm on your side.

431
00:18:52,296 --> 00:18:54,729
Can you just give me
like two minutes?

432
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:56,265
Rose, this is our friend Dave.

433
00:18:56,266 --> 00:18:57,866
He's in from out of town.

434
00:18:57,867 --> 00:19:01,069
- Enchanted.
- Okay, well... right. Right. Sorry.

435
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,773
And Mr. George
is over there.

436
00:19:03,974 --> 00:19:07,710
All right. Okay.
5:30. Thanks. Davey!

437
00:19:07,711 --> 00:19:08,946
Look what I brought in.

438
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:11,882
- What's up?
- Oh, it's good to see you.

439
00:19:11,883 --> 00:19:13,283
Good to see you.

440
00:19:13,284 --> 00:19:15,053
- When did you get in?
- Like an hour ago.

441
00:19:15,054 --> 00:19:16,053
Jesus.

442
00:19:16,253 --> 00:19:17,786
Yeah, we went to the fort.

443
00:19:17,787 --> 00:19:19,356
I got that...
I got that picture.

444
00:19:19,357 --> 00:19:21,791
- Yeah.
- Let's go outside.

445
00:19:21,792 --> 00:19:23,594
Okay.
Hey, rose.

446
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:25,229
Um...

447
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,331
Oh, God.
I'm so high.

448
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:30,100
- I'm sorry.
- What is happening?

449
00:19:30,101 --> 00:19:31,969
What's going on, man?

450
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:38,674
- Good to see you.
- Wow, so you guys have already... clearly I missed...

451
00:19:38,675 --> 00:19:43,347
I missed the, uh, the overture
to this little event.

452
00:19:44,548 --> 00:19:45,348
Dude, I love you.

453
00:19:46,017 --> 00:19:47,985
♪ When you say forever ♪

454
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:50,219
It's not like open like, you know, you're
fucking around with so many other people.

455
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,721
Right, but you're cool with it
if she fucks another guy.

456
00:19:52,722 --> 00:19:54,192
- It's open.
- Um, yeah.

457
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,525
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

458
00:19:55,526 --> 00:19:58,363
But it's more like open
like we're gonna be open

459
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,797
about what's...
what's happening.

460
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:02,165
So, if there's like...

461
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:04,066
she fucks other girls. No.

462
00:20:04,067 --> 00:20:05,836
Well, then she's not open.

463
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,605
No, but it's not even
open like that.

464
00:20:08,606 --> 00:20:12,476
It's like... like,
how she puts it is that, like,

465
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:13,976
if you love somebody
unconditionally,

466
00:20:13,977 --> 00:20:15,411
wouldn't you just want them
to be happy,

467
00:20:15,412 --> 00:20:17,515
even if that means they're gonna
be with somebody else

468
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:18,714
or not with you?

469
00:20:18,715 --> 00:20:20,181
But it's good, though.

470
00:20:20,182 --> 00:20:22,987
You know, it's like everyone
in this town is so the same.

471
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:24,254
She was different,

472
00:20:24,255 --> 00:20:26,288
and I think that's
what I need right now.

473
00:20:26,289 --> 00:20:27,823
- Hey. How are my boys?
- We're good.

474
00:20:27,824 --> 00:20:29,357
Do you know what you want?

475
00:20:29,358 --> 00:20:31,192
We are good. Yes, I'm gonna
have surf and turf, as you know.

476
00:20:31,193 --> 00:20:33,062
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna get the, uh...

477
00:20:33,063 --> 00:20:35,597
You should get surf and turf.
It's really good.

478
00:20:35,598 --> 00:20:37,165
Hey. How's your mom doing
with everything?

479
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:39,168
Oh, she's good, Maddy.
Thanks for asking.

480
00:20:39,169 --> 00:20:40,670
Yeah.
It's a hard time, huh?

481
00:20:40,671 --> 00:20:43,439
Just get the surf and turf,
man. It's good.

482
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,507
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

483
00:20:44,508 --> 00:20:46,976
Hey, did, uh,
did, uh, my baby tell you

484
00:20:46,977 --> 00:20:49,144
that he is quitting
his fishing job?

485
00:20:49,145 --> 00:20:50,347
- He did.
- Yeah.

486
00:20:50,348 --> 00:20:51,347
He's a writer.

487
00:20:51,915 --> 00:20:53,982
- Okay. All right.
- I'm proud of this guy.

488
00:20:53,983 --> 00:20:55,418
Well, that makes one of us.

489
00:20:55,419 --> 00:20:56,951
- Good for him.
- Look at that.

490
00:20:56,952 --> 00:20:58,653
Yeah. Mr. Hemingway needs
more time for his writing.

491
00:20:58,654 --> 00:21:00,922
Oh, thanks for the support, mom.
That's great. Yeah.

492
00:21:00,923 --> 00:21:02,857
I'll get the... let's do
two surf and turfs.

493
00:21:02,858 --> 00:21:04,427
Two surf and turfs.
Okay.

494
00:21:04,428 --> 00:21:06,094
- Yeah. I miss you.
- Yeah. I miss you.

495
00:21:06,095 --> 00:21:07,662
You know,
you talk some sense into him?

496
00:21:07,663 --> 00:21:09,498
I'm gonna smack some sense
into this guy.

497
00:21:09,499 --> 00:21:11,202
I'm gonna fix him up right now.

498
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:13,569
- Thanks, mom.
- She's fantastic.

499
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:14,938
Sorry.

500
00:21:14,939 --> 00:21:17,073
Hey, man,
these new-age chicks...

501
00:21:17,074 --> 00:21:18,540
I had a bunch of those.

502
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:20,642
I don't think she's that
new-agey, to tell you the truth.

503
00:21:20,643 --> 00:21:21,777
I mean, maybe she...

504
00:21:21,778 --> 00:21:23,345
I don't know her that well,
but... you know,

505
00:21:23,346 --> 00:21:25,413
it's not like she goes
to burning man every year

506
00:21:25,414 --> 00:21:27,382
- or something.
- When you're fucking her,

507
00:21:27,383 --> 00:21:29,220
does she light candles
and stuff?

508
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:30,586
I mean, not while...

509
00:21:30,587 --> 00:21:32,854
she doesn't light the candle
while I'm fucking her.

510
00:21:32,855 --> 00:21:34,256
No, I'd hope not 'cause...

511
00:21:34,257 --> 00:21:36,426
that would be dangerous.
But I like candles.

512
00:21:36,427 --> 00:21:39,429
Like a candle around each,
you know, area.

513
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:40,497
Yeah.

514
00:21:40,498 --> 00:21:42,299
You know what I'm hearing
from you?

515
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,566
What?

516
00:21:43,567 --> 00:21:47,437
That you finally
found the ass of a lifetime.

517
00:21:47,438 --> 00:21:48,771
I might have.

518
00:21:48,772 --> 00:21:51,273
You got to be careful
of these new-agey broads, man.

519
00:21:51,274 --> 00:21:52,807
They'll fuck with your head.

520
00:21:52,808 --> 00:21:54,075
I've had it happen to me.

521
00:21:54,076 --> 00:21:55,510
In Vegas, a couple of them...

522
00:21:55,511 --> 00:21:57,546
they wear these flowing dresses
and they chant

523
00:21:57,547 --> 00:21:59,215
and they fucking
light candles and incense

524
00:21:59,216 --> 00:22:00,482
and they fuck with you.

525
00:22:00,483 --> 00:22:01,717
They fuck with you.
Just be careful.

526
00:22:01,718 --> 00:22:03,719
Sounds like you know
what you're doing.

527
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,335
I can't wait to meet her.
Does she have friends?

528
00:22:17,335 --> 00:22:21,837
You know, at some point
in our lives we should take...

529
00:22:21,838 --> 00:22:26,075
take a boat out
and just never come back, man.

530
00:22:26,076 --> 00:22:27,778
- Really?
- Yeah.

531
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:30,146
Where would we go?

532
00:22:30,147 --> 00:22:32,114
I don't know.

533
00:22:32,115 --> 00:22:35,050
Me, you,
and a bunch of broads on a boat.

534
00:22:35,051 --> 00:22:37,921
That sounds good.

535
00:22:37,922 --> 00:22:39,023
What are we gonna do?

536
00:22:40,023 --> 00:22:42,225
We got to do something.

537
00:22:42,226 --> 00:22:43,626
I don't know.

538
00:22:43,627 --> 00:22:45,361
There's not much to do
in this town, as you remember.

539
00:22:45,362 --> 00:22:47,964
Yeah. I wasn't gonna
come at all, man.

540
00:22:47,965 --> 00:22:49,199
I know.

541
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,932
I was surprised
when I got your call.

542
00:22:50,933 --> 00:22:54,806
I kind of felt like I should
do it for my mom, you know?

543
00:22:54,807 --> 00:22:56,272
Yeah.

544
00:22:56,273 --> 00:23:00,443
Like, do you and your mom
talk on the phone and stuff?

545
00:23:00,444 --> 00:23:01,611
We try.

546
00:23:01,612 --> 00:23:04,347
It's hard to fucking talk
with her, you know?

Come on. We got to go.
Let's go.

558
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,320
But it's not her turn.

559
00:24:18,321 --> 00:24:20,025
Cara, please do not
give me a hard time

560
00:24:21,025 --> 00:24:22,527
about this right now, okay?

561
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:25,795
- I'm not.
- Why does mom get two turns?

562
00:24:25,796 --> 00:24:28,764
Hey, trey, can you just keep
them busy for like 20 minutes?

563
00:24:28,765 --> 00:24:30,285
I got to drop Cara off
at Kate's, okay?

564
00:24:31,001 --> 00:24:32,268
Thanks.

565
00:24:32,269 --> 00:24:33,568
Why does mom get two turns
in a row?

566
00:24:33,569 --> 00:24:35,504
She does not get two turns
in a row, okay?

567
00:24:35,505 --> 00:24:37,640
I promise you
I will come back and get you

568
00:24:37,641 --> 00:24:39,775
after I show these people
the house.

569
00:24:39,776 --> 00:24:42,145
You will wake up here
tomorrow, okay?

570
00:24:42,146 --> 00:24:44,214
- Fine.
- Thank you.

571
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:47,416
Bless you.

572
00:24:47,417 --> 00:24:49,118
It was a cough.

573
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:51,787
- That was a cough?
- Yeah.

574
00:24:51,788 --> 00:24:54,659
Hey,
bunny-boo.

575
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,060
Hey, mom.

576
00:24:58,061 --> 00:24:59,295
Hey. Long time no see.

577
00:24:59,296 --> 00:25:00,498
Thanks again for doing this.

578
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,231
Couple hours, tops.

579
00:25:02,232 --> 00:25:03,599
Sure.
It's not a problem.

580
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,866
She can stay here tonight,
if it's easier for you.

581
00:25:04,867 --> 00:25:06,468
No, she's got
the hockey thing tomorrow.

582
00:25:06,469 --> 00:25:07,670
I'll come back.
It's good.

583
00:25:07,671 --> 00:25:09,073
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

584
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:10,539
Here's Gemmy.

585
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,541
Gemmy.

586
00:25:12,542 --> 00:25:14,743
- And that is all.
- Okay.

587
00:25:14,744 --> 00:25:18,748
Oh, hey, uh, by the way,
David's back in town.

588
00:25:18,749 --> 00:25:21,884
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, for a little while.

589
00:25:21,885 --> 00:25:24,720
His dad died...
A couple days ago.

590
00:25:24,721 --> 00:25:26,122
Oh, no.

591
00:25:26,123 --> 00:25:27,025
Yeah. It was like Monday or
Tuesday or something like that.

592
00:25:28,025 --> 00:25:30,661
- I thought you'd want to know.
- I do. Thank you.

593
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:32,362
- All right.
- Hey, Sam.

594
00:25:32,363 --> 00:25:33,997
Hey, Mr. Steve.

595
00:25:33,998 --> 00:25:35,731
How are you, man?

596
00:25:35,732 --> 00:25:36,967
Good to see you.

597
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:38,567
Yeah.
You too.

598
00:25:38,568 --> 00:25:42,137
It's good to, uh... okay.
All right.

599
00:25:42,138 --> 00:25:45,307
Call me later
if you change your mind,

600
00:25:45,308 --> 00:25:47,042
if you decide you want her
to spend the night.

601
00:25:47,043 --> 00:25:48,244
It's really not a problem.

602
00:25:48,245 --> 00:25:49,650
Okay.

603
00:25:53,984 --> 00:25:55,526
Can we eat now?

604
00:26:02,526 --> 00:26:04,295
So, it's all original woodwork,

605
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:08,530
built in the late 1800s,
and six bedrooms.

606
00:26:08,531 --> 00:26:10,298
It's everything you guys
are looking for.

607
00:26:10,299 --> 00:26:11,734
Oh, great. And this
is the kitchen?

608
00:26:11,735 --> 00:26:13,703
Yeah. Go ahead.
Take a look.

609
00:26:13,704 --> 00:26:14,703
Okay, great.

610
00:26:14,704 --> 00:26:16,704
Thank you.

611
00:26:19,977 --> 00:26:21,177
Where's Sammy?

612
00:26:21,178 --> 00:26:26,082
He's got the kid tonight.

613
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:29,686
I want to see some ass.

614
00:26:30,688 --> 00:26:33,456
Where's the spot to go, man?

615
00:26:33,457 --> 00:26:36,359
- I know where we can go.
- Where?

616
00:26:38,529 --> 00:26:43,566
That's amazing.
Whoa!

617
00:26:43,567 --> 00:26:45,602
That's got to hurt, right?

618
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:47,336
Wow.
That's amazing.

619
00:26:47,337 --> 00:26:49,439
The girls in this town, man.

620
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,575
- Like... That.
- They're bad-ass.

621
00:26:51,576 --> 00:26:53,344
They are.
You forgot.

622
00:26:56,012 --> 00:26:57,854
Oh, my God.

623
00:27:03,854 --> 00:27:05,393
Hey, man.

624
00:27:11,695 --> 00:27:15,068
I fucked around with Kate.

625
00:27:18,068 --> 00:27:19,268
What?

626
00:27:19,269 --> 00:27:22,404
No, you didn't.

627
00:27:22,405 --> 00:27:24,207
I did.

628
00:27:24,208 --> 00:27:28,411
You kidding me?

629
00:27:28,412 --> 00:27:32,716
No, it was like
a million years ago.

630
00:27:32,717 --> 00:27:35,952
I'm sure Sam... he wouldn't even
fucking care at this point.

631
00:27:35,953 --> 00:27:37,386
Wait, when was this?

632
00:27:37,387 --> 00:27:38,787
Right before I left.

633
00:27:38,788 --> 00:27:41,257
Remember they had that break?

634
00:27:41,258 --> 00:27:42,459
Yeah.

635
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:46,863
It happened a bunch of times.

636
00:27:46,864 --> 00:27:50,467
You think I'm an asshole?

637
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:52,902
Hey, boys.

638
00:27:52,903 --> 00:27:54,570
- Hey.
- Hey.

639
00:27:54,571 --> 00:27:56,605
How's it going?

640
00:27:56,606 --> 00:27:58,475
Good. How are you?

641
00:27:58,476 --> 00:28:00,342
Good. Jonny,
you want a lap dance?

642
00:28:00,343 --> 00:28:01,809
No, man. Go ahead.
Go for it.

643
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:03,213
You sure? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

644
00:28:03,214 --> 00:28:04,948
How about you?

645
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:07,317
Yeah, I'd love one.

646
00:28:27,404 --> 00:28:30,900
♪ I'm ready for
action, I'm tired of watching ♪

647
00:29:01,672 --> 00:29:03,605
Let's get out of here, man.

648
00:29:03,606 --> 00:29:05,808
Just give it another minute.

649
00:29:05,809 --> 00:29:07,844
Are you serious?
Come on.

650
00:29:07,845 --> 00:29:09,679
- It's nice.
- It's nice?

651
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,047
I want to
show her appreciation.

652
00:29:12,048 --> 00:29:14,784
What's wrong with you?

653
00:29:14,785 --> 00:29:16,852
Nothing. I just want to
get out of here.

654
00:29:16,853 --> 00:29:18,554
You thinking about
the hippie chick?

655
00:29:18,555 --> 00:29:21,722
No. I'm thinking about the bomb
you dropped on me about Kate.

656
00:29:21,723 --> 00:29:23,158
Oh, I shouldn't have
told you that shit.

657
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:25,195
- Just forget about it.
- How do I forget about that?

658
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:26,595
Hold on a second.

659
00:29:26,596 --> 00:29:28,330
Hey. What's going on?
Great dancing tonight.

660
00:29:28,331 --> 00:29:30,865
We just... we're big fans.
We wanted to say it was awesome.

661
00:29:30,866 --> 00:29:32,100
- Thank you.
- All right, guys.

662
00:29:32,101 --> 00:29:33,701
Time for you to go,
though, guys.

663
00:29:33,702 --> 00:29:34,503
No, it's okay, Jeff.

664
00:29:35,005 --> 00:29:36,645
Yeah, it's okay, Jeff.
We're just talking.

665
00:29:37,007 --> 00:29:38,776
- Yeah.
- Always the little guys, huh?

666
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,043
Easy, tiger.

667
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:41,777
Excuse me? What did
you say to me?

668
00:29:41,778 --> 00:29:43,111
What, do I fucking stutter?

669
00:29:43,112 --> 00:29:44,846
- Hey. No, no, no.
- Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.

670
00:29:44,847 --> 00:29:46,614
- We're fine here.
- It's all good. It's all good.

671
00:29:46,615 --> 00:29:48,316
These guys are my friends.
It's okay.

672
00:29:48,317 --> 00:29:50,554
These are your friends? You need
to pick some better friends.

673
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:51,754
They're fine.

674
00:29:51,755 --> 00:29:53,488
You're sure
you're gonna be okay?

675
00:29:53,489 --> 00:29:54,957
I'm fine. Thank you.
Go inside.

676
00:29:54,958 --> 00:29:57,094
I'll stand near the door
until they go.

677
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:59,495
- All right.
- Wow.

678
00:29:59,496 --> 00:30:01,263
- Very protective.
- Yeah, he is, huh?

679
00:30:01,264 --> 00:30:02,631
Is that your boyfriend?

680
00:30:02,632 --> 00:30:04,365
No, we've just had
some trouble with folks

681
00:30:04,366 --> 00:30:05,901
hanging around after the show.

682
00:30:05,902 --> 00:30:07,803
- Oh, I'm sorry. We were just...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

683
00:30:07,804 --> 00:30:09,537
We just wanted to say
you're a great dancer

684
00:30:09,538 --> 00:30:11,672
- and we loved your stuff.
- Phenomenal. Yeah. Really good stuff.

685
00:30:11,673 --> 00:30:12,975
Thanks, guys.
That's really nice.

686
00:30:12,976 --> 00:30:15,913
What's going on tonight?
Where's the party?

687
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:18,314
I don't know.
I'm going to bed.

688
00:30:18,315 --> 00:30:20,449
- Going to bed?
- Yeah. I'm tired.

689
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:22,316
- Really?
- I just got off work.

690
00:30:22,317 --> 00:30:25,086
Listen, I don't go
to strip clubs that much, but...

691
00:30:25,087 --> 00:30:26,824
and correct me if I'm wrong,

692
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:29,358
but did we have
a real connection

693
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:31,393
going on in there or what?

694
00:30:31,394 --> 00:30:32,595
Yeah?

695
00:30:32,596 --> 00:30:34,464
- Yeah.
- Uh... You're right.

696
00:30:34,465 --> 00:30:35,664
See?

697
00:30:35,665 --> 00:30:37,367
You don't go
to strip clubs much.

698
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:38,567
- Oh.
- Ohh!

699
00:30:38,568 --> 00:30:40,169
- Wow.
- Cute, though.

700
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:41,903
Oh, she said you're cute.

701
00:30:41,904 --> 00:30:44,340
- Where you going?
- I'm going home.

702
00:30:44,341 --> 00:30:48,979
Why?
It's early.

703
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,747
I mean, that's...
he's a football player, okay,

704
00:30:51,748 --> 00:30:53,347
but, like,
he's been there, right?

705
00:30:53,348 --> 00:30:55,584
And he's saying,
"it's not what you think it is,

706
00:30:55,585 --> 00:30:58,786
- and this is life," you know?
- Yeah, you can't get what you want.

707
00:30:58,787 --> 00:31:01,256
- It's... that's how it is.
- No, but that's not what I'm saying.

708
00:31:01,257 --> 00:31:03,892
I'm saying that, like, there's a beauty
that you can't get what you want.

709
00:31:03,893 --> 00:31:05,459
- Right. Yeah.
- Right?

710
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:08,296
That's... but I don't think
we're seeing the beauty of it.

711
00:31:08,297 --> 00:31:09,698
Do you know what I mean?

712
00:31:09,699 --> 00:31:10,968
- No. I get it.
- You do?

713
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:12,501
Yeah.
Yes!

714
00:31:12,502 --> 00:31:13,583
I'm just not sure you're...

715
00:31:14,003 --> 00:31:16,672
I think
you're just being nice now.

How are you?
It's so beautiful here.

764

Yeah. Thanks. Yeah.

765

It's amazing.
Did you hear the geese?

766
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:04,774
I-I did hear...
oh!

767
00:34:04,775 --> 00:34:05,775
You.

768
00:34:06,009 --> 00:34:07,741
- So amazing.
- Thank you.

769
00:34:07,742 --> 00:34:10,545
Well, it's... yeah,
it's night, nighttime.

770
00:34:10,546 --> 00:34:12,113
So the geese
are probably sleeping.

771
00:34:12,114 --> 00:34:13,916
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry to wake you up.

772
00:34:13,917 --> 00:34:15,151
It's okay.

773
00:34:15,152 --> 00:34:16,450
Were you sleeping
with the geese?

774
00:34:16,451 --> 00:34:18,054
No, I was just...
I was like half asleep.

775
00:34:18,055 --> 00:34:21,189
Oh, my God. I forgot
how beautiful it is.

776
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:24,061
Yeah. What were you doing
out there?

777
00:34:25,661 --> 00:34:27,997
I was about to do a threesome

778
00:34:27,998 --> 00:34:31,268
with a buddy of mine and some
coke-infested stripper.

779
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:34,403
It was crazy.
It was really insane.

780
00:34:34,404 --> 00:34:35,672
Why would you leave?

781
00:34:35,673 --> 00:34:37,205
I know.

782
00:34:37,206 --> 00:34:38,773
- It sounds good, right?
- Yeah.

783
00:34:38,774 --> 00:34:40,643
That guy freaks me out!
What is that?

784
00:34:40,644 --> 00:34:42,044
Is that your dad?

785
00:34:42,045 --> 00:34:44,378
I told you that's a photograph
of my dad my mom took.

786
00:34:44,379 --> 00:34:46,815
Oh, my God. Thank God
I didn't do that.

787
00:34:46,816 --> 00:34:48,583
Thank God I didn't do that.

788
00:34:48,584 --> 00:34:50,152
I just wanted to come here.

789
00:34:50,153 --> 00:34:52,753
You're like the oasis
in the desert for me.

790
00:34:52,754 --> 00:34:54,722
- Me?
- You look really pretty.

791
00:34:54,723 --> 00:34:56,827
How did you wake up so pretty?

792
00:34:56,828 --> 00:34:59,060
You're really funny.

793
00:34:59,061 --> 00:35:01,061
How do you do it?

794
00:35:01,097 --> 00:35:04,267
- Seriously.
- Jon, look at me.

795
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:05,301
What?

796
00:35:05,302 --> 00:35:08,370
All right,
I'm a little fucked up.

797
00:35:08,371 --> 00:35:09,452
You are a little fucked up.

798
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:11,505
- Yeah.
- It's okay, though.

799
00:35:11,506 --> 00:35:12,706
Where are your hands?

800
00:35:12,707 --> 00:35:14,443
They're in...
in sleeves.

801
00:35:14,444 --> 00:35:20,582
- There they are.
- Those are nice hands.

802
00:35:20,583 --> 00:35:22,518
Thank you.

803
00:35:24,253 --> 00:35:26,988
Sounds like
you had a fun night.

804
00:35:26,989 --> 00:35:28,591
No.
It wasn't fun.

805
00:35:28,592 --> 00:35:31,028
It was a little fun
but not a lot of fun.

806
00:35:32,028 --> 00:35:33,562
This is more fun.

807
00:35:33,563 --> 00:35:34,763
- Oh.
- Yeah.

808
00:35:34,764 --> 00:35:36,799
This is such a soft sweater.

809
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,533
Thanks.

810
00:35:38,534 --> 00:35:39,734
Really soft.

811
00:35:39,735 --> 00:35:41,403
- Feel free to...
- Can I just...

812
00:35:41,404 --> 00:35:42,637
Jon, just...
yeah.

813
00:35:42,638 --> 00:35:44,673
I'm gonna let you
go back to bed in a second.

814
00:35:44,674 --> 00:35:45,943
- I just...
- You are?

815
00:35:45,944 --> 00:35:47,209
- Yeah.
- Um...

816
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:49,443
I'm just gonna stay
right here for a minute.

817
00:35:49,444 --> 00:35:51,412
- Okay.
- It's a beautiful sweater.

818
00:35:51,413 --> 00:35:53,782
- Thank you.
- And you're beautiful.

819
00:35:53,783 --> 00:35:56,119
And the geese
are really beautiful.

820
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,523
You're so cute.

821
00:36:00,523 --> 00:36:08,598
You're like the wild geese...
And the stars and your snow...

822
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:16,138
And the ocean...
The ocean circling downward...

823
00:36:16,139 --> 00:36:21,477
Finding the call
of the geese...

824
00:36:21,478 --> 00:36:28,484
Swimming, flying,
daring into nothingness...

825
00:36:28,485 --> 00:36:32,793
Until the breath of trees
stirs them...

826
00:36:36,793 --> 00:36:40,500
...until they're gone.

827
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:46,269
That's not my best work,
but, you know...

828
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:48,037
Look at me.

829
00:36:48,038 --> 00:36:50,706
...I could give it
a little time to...

830
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:56,444
you're gonna be good.

831
00:36:56,445 --> 00:36:59,348
- You're great.
- Thank you.

832
00:36:59,349 --> 00:37:02,752
And I really like that poem.

833
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:05,722
You are such a good liar.

834
00:37:20,936 --> 00:37:24,711
I'm not lying.

835
00:38:58,268 --> 00:39:00,200
You know I'm not a fisherman.

836
00:39:00,201 --> 00:39:01,869
What is this,
the writing business?

837
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:03,170
Yeah, it is the writing.

838
00:39:03,171 --> 00:39:04,673
Yeah. So, what are you
gonna do for money?

839
00:39:04,674 --> 00:39:06,241
How you gonna live?

840
00:39:06,242 --> 00:39:08,012
- I got some money saved.
- Yeah?

841
00:39:09,012 --> 00:39:11,079
I got to give it a shot now,
you know?

842
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,447
- It's now or never.
- Yeah?

843
00:39:12,448 --> 00:39:14,449
Well, you help me
get a replacement,

844
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:17,086
and then you go go
write "Moby-dick," all right?

845
00:39:17,087 --> 00:39:20,689
- That sounds fair.
- Yeah?

846
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:23,058
Jonny Melville, huh?

847
00:39:23,059 --> 00:39:24,593

00:39:52,222 --> 00:39:53,590
You working tonight?

862
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:59,528
All right, well, maybe we'll
stop by and check you out.

863
00:39:59,529 --> 00:40:00,529
Good.

864
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:04,300
All right.
Have a good day.

865
00:40:42,838 --> 00:40:45,107
Oh. Oh.

866
00:40:45,108 --> 00:40:47,509
Hey, ma.

867
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:52,382
Oh, it's so good to see you.

868
00:40:55,351 --> 00:40:57,819
Come in. Come in.

869
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:00,055
Come in. Come in.

870
00:41:00,056 --> 00:41:02,491
Where's your stuff?

871
00:41:02,492 --> 00:41:06,328
Uh, this is it.
This is all I got.

872
00:41:06,329 --> 00:41:07,730
Oh. Okay.

873
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:08,929
- It's good.
- Mm.

874
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:10,132
It's really good, ma.

875
00:41:10,133 --> 00:41:11,734
Thank you.

876
00:41:11,735 --> 00:41:15,504
You're welcome.

877
00:41:15,505 --> 00:41:19,010
I miss...
I miss your quahogs.

878
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:23,712
Well, you're in luck...

879
00:41:23,713 --> 00:41:24,712
Hmm?

880
00:41:24,713 --> 00:41:26,313
...because I made a bunch
for tomorrow.

881
00:41:26,314 --> 00:41:28,318
I'll give you some
to take back.

882
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:34,290
Lorraine is, you know,
organizing everything,

883
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:36,659
and I felt it's not
really my place to,

884
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,560
you know, get in her way.

885
00:41:38,561 --> 00:41:41,497
- Not really your place?
- Mnh-mnh.

886
00:41:41,498 --> 00:41:44,299
You were married to him, too.

887
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:49,837
I know, but... They had
the three girls, you know?

888
00:41:49,838 --> 00:41:52,409
They're all doing a lot
to help out, so...

889
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:54,542
And you're okay with that?

890
00:41:54,543 --> 00:41:55,678
I am.

891
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:58,081
Yeah, they're letting me
have the reception here,

892
00:41:58,082 --> 00:41:59,281
so that's good.

893
00:41:59,282 --> 00:42:01,383
They're letting you?

894
00:42:01,384 --> 00:42:04,919
Wow, that's really nice
of them.

895
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,023
They're letting you.

896
00:42:07,023 --> 00:42:09,764
That's unbelievable.

897
00:42:15,764 --> 00:42:18,936
I wish you'd got to see him.

898
00:42:20,936 --> 00:42:22,269
Yeah.
I've been busy.

899
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:24,512
I just... I couldn't
get back, you know?

900
00:42:29,512 --> 00:42:32,882
What are you gonna do?

901
00:42:39,956 --> 00:42:42,936
He loved you.

902
00:42:52,936 --> 00:42:55,916
He did.

903
00:43:07,916 --> 00:43:11,886
Why didn't you tell me?

904
00:43:11,887 --> 00:43:16,091
He had a whole other life
with a whole other family,

905
00:43:16,092 --> 00:43:17,426
and here you are.

906
00:43:17,427 --> 00:43:19,030
You're still sticking up
for him.

907
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:22,896
I have to go find out
from other people, you know?

908
00:43:22,897 --> 00:43:25,001
I had to... I mean, I wish
you were there that day.

909
00:43:26,001 --> 00:43:27,368
Oh, please.

910
00:43:27,369 --> 00:43:28,604
I don't know.

911
00:43:28,605 --> 00:43:30,070
I don't want to do this
with you.

912
00:43:30,071 --> 00:43:32,775
I don't want to
fucking do this with you.

913
00:43:34,143 --> 00:43:36,376
This is why... this is why
I didn't want to come back.

914
00:43:36,377 --> 00:43:37,878
This is why
I stay away from you.

915
00:43:37,879 --> 00:43:40,050
This is why I stay away
from this fucking house

916
00:43:40,051 --> 00:43:44,319
and this fucking town
and this...

917
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:47,355
Why wouldn't you tell me, mom?

918
00:43:47,356 --> 00:43:51,893
I have to hear about it
from my fucking friends?

919
00:43:51,894 --> 00:43:54,902
Why?

920
00:43:58,902 --> 00:44:03,907
Because I didn't want to put
you through what I went through.

921
00:44:10,679 --> 00:44:13,018
You were so little.

922
00:44:49,018 --> 00:44:50,585
Cara!

923
00:44:50,586 --> 00:44:51,787
- Cara!
- Yeah?

924
00:44:51,788 --> 00:44:53,921
Are you ready?
We got to go!

925
00:44:53,922 --> 00:44:54,722
I'm coming!

926
00:44:55,023 --> 00:44:56,858
Your mom's coming
in like 10 minutes!

927
00:44:56,859 --> 00:44:58,825
- Okay!
- Yo, what's up with Jon?

928
00:44:58,826 --> 00:45:00,829
He's not picking up the phone.

929
00:45:00,830 --> 00:45:02,765
Yeah, he's...

930
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:04,501
he's in therapy
till 7:00.

931
00:45:04,502 --> 00:45:05,901
What?

932
00:45:05,902 --> 00:45:08,668
He's been going to a fucking
shrink like two months.

933
00:45:08,669 --> 00:45:10,070
Really?
What's wrong with him?

934
00:45:10,071 --> 00:45:12,074
I don't know what the fuck
is wrong with him.

935
00:45:12,075 --> 00:45:13,375
He's feeling it?

936
00:45:13,376 --> 00:45:14,977
He's got a lot
of feelings inside of him.

937
00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:17,112
He's feeling all of it,
getting all of it at once.

938
00:45:17,113 --> 00:45:20,047
- Give me.
- You're a dad.

939
00:45:20,048 --> 00:45:21,649
Fucking weird.

940
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:24,218
You like being a dad?

941
00:45:24,219 --> 00:45:25,820
Yeah, I like being a dad.

942
00:45:25,821 --> 00:45:28,054
I mean, I hate parts
of being a dad,

943
00:45:28,055 --> 00:45:29,295
but mostly, I like being a dad.

944
00:45:31,027 --> 00:45:32,827
You better get fucked up
tonight.

945
00:45:32,828 --> 00:45:35,228
- You gonna get fucked up?
- Dad, I can't find my other shoe.

946
00:45:36,032 --> 00:45:38,132
I'm gonna
get fucked up tonight.

947
00:45:38,133 --> 00:45:39,454
You do not need
to worry about me.

948
00:45:40,003 --> 00:45:41,903
You don't need
to worry about shoes.

949
00:45:41,904 --> 00:45:43,606
I'm gonna find shoes.
Say hi.

950
00:45:43,607 --> 00:45:45,506
I'm gonna find your shoe!

951
00:45:45,507 --> 00:45:47,744
Hi, Cara.
What do you got there?

952
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:51,312
- Giraffe.
- Giraffe? Can I see?

953
00:45:51,313 --> 00:45:53,948
Wow.
What's his name?

954
00:45:53,949 --> 00:45:56,186
Or is it a her or...
what is it?

955
00:45:56,187 --> 00:45:57,585
- Gemmy.
- Gemmy?

956
00:45:57,586 --> 00:45:58,986
What's up, Gemmy?

957
00:45:58,987 --> 00:46:02,191
You guys partying
up there or what?

958
00:46:02,192 --> 00:46:03,424
- No.
- No?

959
00:46:03,425 --> 00:46:05,893
What do you got
going on tonight?

960
00:46:05,894 --> 00:46:09,564
Going to my mom's house.

961
00:46:09,565 --> 00:46:12,433
That's got to be cool, right?

962
00:46:12,434 --> 00:46:15,337
- Yeah.
- What are you guys doing?

963
00:46:15,338 --> 00:46:17,876
Play games.

964
00:46:20,876 --> 00:46:23,445
Do people tell you
you look like your mom a lot?

965
00:46:23,446 --> 00:46:24,645
I don't know.

966
00:46:24,646 --> 00:46:28,482
- Cara!
- I'm coming.

967
00:46:28,483 --> 00:46:30,056
Hey.

968
00:46:33,056 --> 00:46:35,425
Do you have
your stuff with the...

969
00:46:35,426 --> 00:46:36,924
- yes.
- Okay.

970
00:46:36,925 --> 00:46:39,028
So, were you upset that
he didn't tell you about it?

971
00:46:40,028 --> 00:46:41,230
No.

972
00:46:41,231 --> 00:46:43,464
No?

973
00:46:43,465 --> 00:46:45,835
No. I mean, I wasn't upset
that he didn't tell me about it.

974
00:46:45,836 --> 00:46:49,037
I guess I'm just, like,
a little thrown.

975
00:46:49,038 --> 00:46:50,272
Yeah?

976
00:46:50,273 --> 00:46:54,442
'Cause it kind of changes
my whole idea of, like,

977
00:46:54,443 --> 00:46:55,909
what we all were to each other,

978
00:46:55,910 --> 00:46:57,512
like we were these brothers
or something, you know,

979
00:46:57,513 --> 00:46:59,580
which just isn't true, so...

980
00:46:59,581 --> 00:47:01,183
- Yeah.
- That's fine.

981
00:47:01,184 --> 00:47:03,219
That's just the way it is.
People are out for themselves.

982
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:04,752
Mm-hmm.

983
00:47:04,753 --> 00:47:09,091
It's like I'm still trying
to hang on to this... Thing

984
00:47:09,092 --> 00:47:13,428
that, like, just never existed
to begin with.

985
00:47:13,429 --> 00:47:15,763
- Mm. Mm-hmm.
- Sam?

986
00:47:15,764 --> 00:47:18,834
Hey, I'm telling you...
tie your shoe.

987
00:47:18,835 --> 00:47:20,368
Cara?

988
00:47:20,369 --> 00:47:21,837
Are you ready to go?

989
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:24,139
- We'll be right down.
- Kate.

990
00:47:27,409 --> 00:47:29,449
Hi.

991
00:47:34,449 --> 00:47:36,451
- How you doing?
- I'm okay.

992
00:47:36,452 --> 00:47:38,621
- How are you?
- How do I look?

993
00:47:38,622 --> 00:47:41,391
Hey.

994
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:49,364
I'm really sorry
to hear about your dad.

995
00:47:49,365 --> 00:47:52,466
How you holding up?

996
00:47:52,467 --> 00:47:53,570
Good.

997
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:56,772
You look good.

998
00:47:56,773 --> 00:47:59,442
I don't look good.
I look tired.

999
00:48:00,842 --> 00:48:05,680
- Your eyes got bigger.
- Let me see. Let me see you.

1000
00:48:05,681 --> 00:48:07,848
You look exactly the same.

1001
00:48:07,849 --> 00:48:09,451
- I do?
- Yep.

1002
00:48:09,452 --> 00:48:11,386
I got grays in here.

1003
00:48:11,387 --> 00:48:13,555
Yeah.
It suits you.

1004
00:48:13,556 --> 00:48:14,756
So...

1005
00:48:14,757 --> 00:48:17,125
What's going on with you?

1006
00:48:17,126 --> 00:48:18,626
You know I got married again.

1007
00:48:18,627 --> 00:48:19,961
Yeah, I heard.
Jon told me.

1008
00:48:19,962 --> 00:48:21,496
Yeah?
What'd he tell you?

1009
00:48:21,497 --> 00:48:25,600
Uh, he told me that the guy
has a Walker? Is that...

1010
00:48:25,601 --> 00:48:27,234
you're such an asshole.

1011
00:48:27,235 --> 00:48:29,338
- Yeah, I heard that.
- Did you do that?

1012
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:30,538
You get married?

1013
00:48:30,539 --> 00:48:32,072
No, no kids, no marriage.

1014
00:48:32,073 --> 00:48:35,110
I don't believe in that
institution, I don't think.

1015
00:48:35,111 --> 00:48:39,881
I had this... I was living
with this girl, but it didn't...

1016
00:48:39,882 --> 00:48:43,887
- Work out?
- Not the one.

1017
00:48:44,887 --> 00:48:48,189
What are you looking at me
like that for?

1018
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:49,825
I'm just looking at you.

1019
00:48:49,826 --> 00:48:51,826
Come on.
Don't do that.

1020
00:48:51,827 --> 00:48:53,128
- What?
- Don't do that.

1021
00:48:53,129 --> 00:48:55,635
- Don't do what?
- Don't do that.

1022
00:48:59,635 --> 00:49:01,267
I wanted to keep in touch
with you.

1023
00:49:01,268 --> 00:49:03,403
I just thought, um, that you
didn't want to keep in touch.

1024
00:49:03,404 --> 00:49:05,271
I was just trying
to leave you alone, so...

1025
00:49:05,272 --> 00:49:07,208
It's not that I didn't want
to keep in touch.

1026
00:49:07,209 --> 00:49:08,842
I didn't know
where to find you, Davey.

1027
00:49:08,843 --> 00:49:10,177
Yeah, I didn't know
where to find me,

1028
00:49:10,178 --> 00:49:11,880
and I still don't know
where to find me.

1029
00:49:11,881 --> 00:49:15,216
Put on...
put on your...

1030
00:49:15,217 --> 00:49:16,685
You look good.

1031
00:49:16,686 --> 00:49:20,221
When's the service
for your dad?

1032
00:49:20,222 --> 00:49:21,223
Uh, Friday.

1033
00:49:21,224 --> 00:49:23,324
You gonna do it
at St. Bart's?

1034
00:49:23,325 --> 00:49:25,992
That's what they say,
yeah, St. Bart's.

1035
00:49:25,993 --> 00:49:28,329
- What time?
- Oh, don't... don't come.

1036
00:49:28,330 --> 00:49:29,563
It's gonna be quick.

1037
00:49:29,564 --> 00:49:32,365
That's nice of you, but...
that's good. It's...

1038
00:49:32,366 --> 00:49:35,603
it would really mean a lot to me
if I could be there.

1039
00:49:35,604 --> 00:49:37,572
Well, then we'll see you there.

1040
00:49:37,573 --> 00:49:38,774
Mom!

1041
00:49:38,775 --> 00:49:42,181
That's me.

1042
00:49:46,181 --> 00:49:47,650
Yes, sweetheart?

1043
00:49:50,186 --> 00:49:51,819
Where's your jacket?

1044
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:53,288
Dad's got it.

1045
00:49:53,289 --> 00:49:54,522
- Hey.
- Hey.

1046
00:49:54,523 --> 00:49:56,259
Turn around.
There we go.

1047
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:57,591
Here's this.

1048
00:49:57,592 --> 00:50:02,531
Uh, it's art things,
and then there's drawings, too.

1049
00:50:02,532 --> 00:50:04,966
They're a little bit unruly.

1050
00:50:04,967 --> 00:50:06,201
No, they're not.

1051
00:50:06,202 --> 00:50:07,802
Yeah. Well,
they're like rolled up...

1052
00:50:07,803 --> 00:50:09,869
- it's like a poster-sized thing.
- Okay. Go get it.

1053
00:50:09,870 --> 00:50:11,405
It's like butcher paper
or something.

1054
00:50:11,406 --> 00:50:13,106
What do you mean,
it's in a scroll?

1055
00:50:13,107 --> 00:50:15,309
I don't know. It's like a...
what's-her-name's class.

1056
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:17,278
- Oh, miss Gibbs.
- Miss Gibbs' class.

1057
00:50:17,279 --> 00:50:19,947
Yes, miss Gibbs and her
unorthodox art projects.

1058
00:50:19,948 --> 00:50:21,282
- She's fucking weird.
- Do you still design?

1059
00:50:21,283 --> 00:50:22,883
- Do you still do that stuff?
- Yeah.

1060
00:50:22,884 --> 00:50:24,485
Oh, you got to see her stuff.
It's amazing.

1061
00:50:24,486 --> 00:50:26,119
She's still doing amazing stuff.
She's got her own place now.

1062
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:27,554
- Sam.
- Oh, good for you. That's great.

1063
00:50:27,555 --> 00:50:28,923
He's really
over-selling it.

1064
00:50:28,924 --> 00:50:30,657
Yeah, it's like a shop
on route 6.

1065
00:50:30,658 --> 00:50:34,697
- It's amazing.
- It's really... it's not all that great, but thank you.

1066
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:36,865
- Thanks.
- I think it's good.

1067
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:41,003
So, uh, what are you guys
doing tonight?

1068
00:50:42,003 --> 00:50:46,107
Uh, we are gonna see if
the caplog will still let us in.

1069
00:50:46,108 --> 00:50:47,669
- Caplog? Wow.
- Yeah. You want to come?

1070
00:50:48,010 --> 00:50:49,512
You should come with us.

1071
00:50:49,513 --> 00:50:50,712
- No.
- What?

1072
00:50:50,713 --> 00:50:52,146
- No, I am not coming.
- Why not?

1073
00:50:52,147 --> 00:50:53,427
'Cause I've got,
you know, plans.

1074
00:50:54,016 --> 00:50:56,182
- You too good for us?
- Not too good for you.

1075
00:50:56,183 --> 00:50:57,717
I just have other plans.

1076
00:50:57,718 --> 00:50:59,854
She's good. The...
the old man she's got.

1077
00:50:59,855 --> 00:51:01,088
Oh, yeah, yeah.
No. You have plans.

1078
00:51:01,089 --> 00:51:02,423
He's not an old man.
He's 47 years old.

1079
00:51:02,424 --> 00:51:04,224
No, you got to plan out
his meals.

1080
00:51:04,225 --> 00:51:05,492
- It's really not that funny.
- You got to make sure

1081
00:51:05,493 --> 00:51:06,961
that everything
is chewable, soft, soft.

1082
00:51:06,962 --> 00:51:08,162
- Change his diapers.
- You guys are awful.

1083
00:51:08,163 --> 00:51:09,530
- Cara!
- Chew foods for him.

1084
00:51:09,531 --> 00:51:11,231
- Shut up!
- Do you put diaper cream on his...

1085
00:51:11,232 --> 00:51:12,900
- be quiet.
- How many teeth are still good?

1086
00:51:12,901 --> 00:51:14,137
Hey, sweetheart.
Come on.

1087
00:51:14,138 --> 00:51:17,272
- Where's your backpack?
- I'll get it.

1088
00:51:17,273 --> 00:51:19,313
See you at the service.

1089
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:30,284
It's, uh... I think, like,
if someone will get it,

1090
00:51:30,285 --> 00:51:32,621
then, like,
I can stop talking about it.

1091
00:51:32,622 --> 00:51:34,256
Yeah. Mm.

1092
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:36,055
But it's like... it's not that
I'm obsessed with tom Brady.

1093
00:51:36,056 --> 00:51:37,657
It's just like...
you know,

1094
00:51:37,658 --> 00:51:39,527
because he was the quarterback
like me, and he was the...

1095
00:51:39,528 --> 00:51:41,929
you know, that was the guy
you wanted to be or whatever.

1096
00:51:41,930 --> 00:51:44,898
And not that I'm gonna be
tom Brady, but...

1097
00:51:44,899 --> 00:51:47,235
Well, why don't you
just try to be you?

1098
00:51:47,236 --> 00:51:49,971
I love how you always say that.

1099
00:51:49,972 --> 00:51:51,805
But it's true.

1100
00:51:51,806 --> 00:51:53,375
I know.

1101
00:51:53,376 --> 00:51:55,675
But I don't even know what
that even means, like, being me.

1102
00:51:55,676 --> 00:51:59,282
I feel like I've been trying
to be other people for so long

1103
00:51:59,283 --> 00:52:02,450
that I wouldn't even know
how to be me.

1104
00:52:02,451 --> 00:52:05,760
You could try being you
right here.

1105
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:13,630
Right in this moment.

1106
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:17,799
That doesn't feel good.

1107
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:21,468
It doesn't have to.
It's whatever it is.

1108
00:52:21,469 --> 00:52:25,207
No, I just...
I don't want to do that.

1109
00:52:25,208 --> 00:52:28,910
- What else have you got?
- I don't know.

1110
00:52:28,911 --> 00:52:30,945
I just...
I don't want to do that.

1111
00:52:30,946 --> 00:52:32,880
I want something else,
you know?

1112
00:52:32,881 --> 00:52:34,347
- Like what?
- I don't know.

1113
00:52:34,348 --> 00:52:36,652
- Anything, anything else.
- Such as...?

1114
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:39,187
Like, anything besides this.

1115
00:52:39,188 --> 00:52:43,924
It just doesn't feel...
it doesn't feel right, you know?

1116
00:52:43,925 --> 00:52:46,361
- I'm just sick of it.
- Yeah.

1117
00:52:46,362 --> 00:52:49,063
I'm sick of all the bullshit,
all the fucking bullshit,

1118
00:52:49,064 --> 00:52:51,331
just trying to let go...
"I'm trying to find myself."

1119
00:52:51,332 --> 00:52:53,467
You know? Why do I have to
be that guy, you know?

1120
00:52:53,468 --> 00:52:56,371
I don't want to
be him anymore, all right?

1121
00:52:56,372 --> 00:52:58,473
Like, I'm fucking sick of it.

1122
00:52:58,474 --> 00:53:01,614
I don't want to be him anymore!

1123
00:53:07,483 --> 00:53:09,317
I'm sorry.

1124
00:53:09,318 --> 00:53:11,657
I'm just...

1125
00:53:15,657 --> 00:53:17,027
Stupid.

1126
00:53:18,027 --> 00:53:21,930
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm... I'm sorry.

1127
00:53:21,931 --> 00:53:23,598
I'm ridiculous.

1128
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:25,898
I just
feel ridiculous right now.

1129
00:53:25,899 --> 00:53:27,402
There's nothing
to be sorry about.

1130
00:53:27,403 --> 00:53:32,407
That's how
you were feeling just now.

1131
00:53:38,914 --> 00:53:40,547
Hey, Jonny,

1132
00:53:40,548 --> 00:53:42,418
you finally get
the ass of a lifetime?

1133
00:53:42,419 --> 00:53:44,052
Jonny!

1134
00:53:45,887 --> 00:53:47,922
How you feeling?

1135
00:53:49,224 --> 00:53:51,557
Do you enjoy any of the
new things that you...

1136
00:53:51,558 --> 00:53:54,297
Yeah. No. I enjoy everything.
I enjoy it all.

1137
00:53:54,298 --> 00:53:55,830
Jonny!

1138
00:53:55,831 --> 00:53:58,700
You got some feelings up there!

1139
00:53:58,701 --> 00:54:02,005
- Talking it out?
- Jon, is your therapist okay? Is she hot?

1140
00:54:03,005 --> 00:54:06,005
I think that's my ride.

1141
00:54:06,041 --> 00:54:08,343
I think it's about time,
anyhow.

1142
00:54:08,344 --> 00:54:11,513
Oh, there he is.
Oh, yeah, tell him.

1143
00:54:11,514 --> 00:54:12,513
Coming.

1144
00:54:12,514 --> 00:54:14,114
Hi, Jonny.

1145
00:54:14,115 --> 00:54:15,382
Unbelievable.
You guys are unbelievable.

1146
00:54:15,383 --> 00:54:16,849
- You feel better?
- Yeah. That's great.

1147
00:54:16,850 --> 00:54:18,452
- Is everything better?
- Yeah, everything's better.

1148
00:54:18,453 --> 00:54:19,887
Did she tuck you in tonight?

1149
00:54:19,888 --> 00:54:21,155
- Get the fuck away from me.
- Here you go.

1150
00:54:21,156 --> 00:54:22,655
- This will make you happy.
- Jesus Christ.

1151
00:54:22,656 --> 00:54:24,425
You sure you don't
want one, Sammy?

1152
00:54:24,426 --> 00:54:26,262
No. I'll have one
in like four minutes.

1153
00:54:27,762 --> 00:54:29,229
Can we please get away
from my therapist's office?

1154
00:54:29,230 --> 00:54:30,731
Promise me you'll get
fucked up tonight.

1155
00:54:30,732 --> 00:54:31,972
- It's left. Go left.
- Go left?

1156
00:54:32,001 --> 00:54:33,333
- Go left. No, left. Left.
- Go left. Go...?

1157
00:54:33,334 --> 00:54:35,170
Left. No. Straight,
straight, straight.

1158
00:54:39,842 --> 00:54:42,275
Hey, Tommy, is this is Shehee
in this picture here?

1159
00:54:42,276 --> 00:54:44,146
Oh, yeah. Yep.
He's still around.

1160
00:54:44,147 --> 00:54:45,546
Mark Shehee?

1161
00:54:45,547 --> 00:54:48,850
- Yeah. Look at this.
- Really?

1162
00:54:48,851 --> 00:54:51,285
He's still fucking ugly.

1163
00:54:51,286 --> 00:54:53,555
- Oh, my God!
- Right?

1164
00:54:53,556 --> 00:54:57,225
He looks like
he's 10 years old.

1165
00:54:57,226 --> 00:55:00,761
It's like a fucking
time machine in here.

1166
00:55:00,762 --> 00:55:02,061
Is he around anymore?

1167
00:55:02,062 --> 00:55:04,430
He's still here.
He's kicking around.

1168
00:55:04,431 --> 00:55:07,934
I haven't seen in maybe like
a year, but... He's around.

1169
00:55:07,935 --> 00:55:09,635
He works at the drugstore.

1170
00:55:09,636 --> 00:55:11,204
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

1171
00:55:11,205 --> 00:55:12,606
- All set, guys.
- I got this. I got this.

1172
00:55:12,607 --> 00:55:14,441
- Thank you. Thank you.
- All right, here's to you, man.

1173
00:55:14,442 --> 00:55:16,978
- Great to see you.
- Good to see you guys.

1174
00:55:16,979 --> 00:55:18,978
Fuckers.

1175
00:55:19,014 --> 00:55:20,415
- Whoo!
- Ohh!

1176
00:55:20,416 --> 00:55:21,783
Ugh.

1177
00:55:21,784 --> 00:55:23,184
♪ Wait for me, babe ♪

1178
00:55:23,185 --> 00:55:24,986
♪ no, it's gonna take... ♪

1179
00:55:24,987 --> 00:55:26,721
Oh!
Fucking come on.

1180
00:55:26,722 --> 00:55:30,091
That's all right, Sammy.
I'm sorry.

1181
00:55:30,092 --> 00:55:32,093
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1182
00:55:32,094 --> 00:55:34,596
- You sorry?
- Get the fuck off me.

1183
00:55:34,597 --> 00:55:36,095
We're gonna go 11 out of 20.

1184
00:55:36,096 --> 00:55:37,430
It was a good game.
It was...

1185
00:55:37,431 --> 00:55:39,501
yeah, it was a great game.
You had a great game.

1186
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:43,273
Also, go fuck yourself.

1187
00:55:45,273 --> 00:55:46,675
It's on, Sammy.

1188
00:55:48,411 --> 00:55:50,779
- Good-looking shot.
- Can you...

1189
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:54,583
have you not won enough
without fucking hitting my hand?

1190
00:55:54,584 --> 00:55:56,618
What are you talking about?

1191
00:55:56,619 --> 00:55:58,919
- What does that mean?
- Oh, no!

1192
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:01,090
- What'd you hear?
- I remember...

1193
00:56:01,091 --> 00:56:03,691
I was just saying
I liked it rough.

1194
00:56:03,692 --> 00:56:05,224
- Oh!
- I like it rough.

1195
00:56:05,225 --> 00:56:06,427
It wasn't me.
It was not me.

1196
00:56:06,428 --> 00:56:07,927
- I like to pull hair.
- Yeah, yeah.

1197
00:56:07,928 --> 00:56:09,128
- You started it?
- No.

1198
00:56:09,129 --> 00:56:10,563
- My goodness, no.
- "My goodness."

1199
00:56:10,564 --> 00:56:13,200
Look at this hair, this fucking
red hair... beautiful.

1200
00:56:13,201 --> 00:56:14,637
Yeah.
He likes redheads.

1201
00:56:14,638 --> 00:56:15,770
Wow. Does he?

1202
00:56:15,771 --> 00:56:17,237
Yeah. It's this little thing
that he has.

1203
00:56:17,238 --> 00:56:18,671
Oh, I thought I was special.

1204
00:56:18,672 --> 00:56:20,307
No, no, no, you are special.

1205
00:56:20,308 --> 00:56:22,077
You're the most special redhead
I've ever seen.

1206
00:56:22,078 --> 00:56:23,578
- Yeah.
- Whatever.

1207
00:56:23,579 --> 00:56:28,316
I had a friend...
Who was on a date with a guy...

1208
00:56:28,317 --> 00:56:31,218
Who she didn't like at all.

1209
00:56:31,219 --> 00:56:32,719
And he went
to kiss her good night

1210
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:33,954
and he pulled her hair

1211
00:56:33,955 --> 00:56:36,423
and asked her if she wanted
to take a shower.

1212
00:56:36,424 --> 00:56:37,827
- And because...
- Are you serious?

1213
00:56:38,027 --> 00:56:40,594
Yeah. Because he pulled her
hair, she said okay.

1214
00:56:40,595 --> 00:56:42,229
That's great.
Wait. What?

1215
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:43,996
- It was about the hair-pulling.
- Really?

1216
00:56:43,997 --> 00:56:45,432
Yeah, I've been with
a bunch of girls

1217
00:56:45,433 --> 00:56:46,666
that like their hair pulled.

1218
00:56:46,667 --> 00:56:48,601
- That was her thing.
- She liked it.

1219
00:56:48,602 --> 00:56:50,470
- Is that, like, a thing?
- I've never heard, but she liked it.

1220
00:56:50,471 --> 00:56:52,842
Do you need another drink?
Write that down.

1221
00:56:52,843 --> 00:56:54,042
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1222
00:56:54,043 --> 00:56:55,343
"Must pull hair."

1223
00:56:55,344 --> 00:56:56,709
But I think that
if you did that 100 times,

1224
00:56:56,710 --> 00:56:59,481
- 99 times it would work.
- Right there.

1225
00:57:01,650 --> 00:57:04,986
Ready? Sammy?
Beautiful, baby.

1226
00:57:04,987 --> 00:57:08,089
Here we go.

00:57:16,965 --> 00:57:19,173
Sammy.

1231
00:57:25,173 --> 00:57:27,275
It just went bang.

1232
00:57:55,503 --> 00:57:58,273
Hey!
What'd you say?

1233
00:58:00,708 --> 00:58:04,708
Sorry.

1234
00:58:08,250 --> 00:58:09,650
She's a very lovely young lady.

1235
00:58:09,651 --> 00:58:11,751
- Let's get out of here.
- Yeah, we should.

1236
00:58:11,752 --> 00:58:13,186
Where we going?
Great plan.

1237
00:58:13,187 --> 00:58:14,387
What?
What's the plan?

1238
00:58:14,388 --> 00:58:15,755
Grab your coats.
Grab your coats.

1239
00:58:15,756 --> 00:58:18,224
Tommy, we're out of here.
We all paid up?

1240
00:58:18,225 --> 00:58:23,162
- Yep, all paid up.
- You'll love it. It's a surprise. It's gonna be great.

1241
00:58:23,163 --> 00:58:24,363
- Okay, guys.
- Tommy.

1242
00:58:24,364 --> 00:58:26,133
- See you soon.
- See you later.

1243
00:58:26,134 --> 00:58:27,633
Hey. Be safe.
Night, guys.

1244
00:58:27,634 --> 00:58:29,154
Hey, man, it was nice
to see you again.

1245
00:58:30,005 --> 00:58:31,205
Ugh! Goddamn it.

1246
00:58:31,206 --> 00:58:32,607
Where's my coat? Oh.

1247
00:58:32,608 --> 00:58:34,576
It's warmer inside.

1248
00:58:34,577 --> 00:58:39,546
I promise.
That's it. That's it.

1249
00:58:39,547 --> 00:58:42,684
After you, Sammy.

1250
00:58:48,556 --> 00:58:50,325
- Wah!
- Go inside.

1251
00:58:50,326 --> 00:58:51,658
Just go inside.

1252
00:58:51,659 --> 00:58:53,962
Go inside.
It's warm.

1253
00:58:53,963 --> 00:58:55,964
Whose is it?

1254
00:58:55,965 --> 00:58:57,497
Is this your boat?

1255
00:58:57,498 --> 00:59:00,969
No, it's not mine.
It's my boss' boat.

1256
00:59:15,317 --> 00:59:17,050
I mean, it was kind of awful.

1257
00:59:17,051 --> 00:59:19,922
He... they... we switched
all of their license plates.

1258
00:59:19,923 --> 00:59:23,625
Just to...
are we moving right now?

1259
00:59:23,626 --> 00:59:26,727
No, we're drifting.
We're anchored.

1260
00:59:26,728 --> 00:59:29,864
Sammy, you dancing down there?!

1261
00:59:31,065 --> 00:59:32,065
Party!

1262
00:59:32,534 --> 00:59:34,300
What the fuck are they doing?

1263
00:59:34,301 --> 00:59:36,036
I don't know what the fuck
they're doing.

1264
00:59:36,037 --> 00:59:37,239
What the fuck is anybody...

1265
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,439
- Sammy!
- Yeah?

1266
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:40,608
- You want to dance?
- I'm... I'm good.

1267
00:59:40,609 --> 00:59:42,377
Thanks, Davey.
I'm good.

1268
00:59:42,378 --> 00:59:43,844
You want me to come up?

1269
00:59:43,845 --> 00:59:46,045
- No, I don't.
- No. Are you okay?

1270
00:59:46,046 --> 00:59:47,615
- What's that?
- Is she okay?

1271
00:59:47,616 --> 00:59:49,615
She's perfect.

1272
00:59:49,784 --> 00:59:51,717
What are you doing up there?!

1273
00:59:51,718 --> 00:59:53,722
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
Let's remember...

1274
00:59:53,723 --> 00:59:55,390
Yep.

1275
00:59:55,391 --> 00:59:56,591
Well...

1276
00:59:56,592 --> 00:59:58,326
♪ You're gone ♪

1277
00:59:58,327 --> 00:59:59,245
♪ you're gone ♪

1278
01:00:00,195 --> 01:00:01,297
♪ oh ♪

1279
01:00:03,297 --> 01:00:06,001
Sorry.

1280
01:00:23,418 --> 01:00:24,617
- She does like him.
- Yeah.

1281
01:00:24,618 --> 01:00:25,952
How long have you known Sammy?

1282
01:00:25,953 --> 01:00:27,586
How did that happen?
I missed that.

1283
01:00:27,587 --> 01:00:28,954
No, no, I saw that coming.

1284
01:00:28,955 --> 01:00:30,759
- You saw that happening?
- I saw that happening.

1285
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:34,300
It was... it was...
it was beautiful.

1286
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:40,936
Okay.

1287
01:00:41,936 --> 01:00:43,538
Hold on. Hold on.

1288
01:00:43,539 --> 01:00:45,473
Wait.
Mnh. Mnh.

1289
01:00:45,474 --> 01:00:48,978
- Wait. Ah.
- Oh.

1290
01:00:50,978 --> 01:00:54,147
I'm... I...

1291
01:00:54,148 --> 01:00:59,021
Did you... did you...?

1292
01:01:00,021 --> 01:01:01,955
Um... Sorry about that.

1293
01:01:01,956 --> 01:01:05,360
No, it's fine.
It's, um, like...

1294
01:01:07,628 --> 01:01:10,098
Sorry about that.

1295
01:01:10,099 --> 01:01:13,201
Hey, it's...

1296
01:01:13,202 --> 01:01:15,803
it's okay.

1297
01:01:15,804 --> 01:01:20,540
Been a little while for me.

1298
01:01:20,541 --> 01:01:24,946
Hey... It's...
it's okay.

1299
01:01:24,947 --> 01:01:26,881
It's fine.

1300
01:01:26,882 --> 01:01:28,851
It's fine.

1301
01:01:31,018 --> 01:01:32,193
It's fine.

1302
01:02:33,614 --> 01:02:37,884
You all right?

1303
01:02:37,885 --> 01:02:41,421
Yeah. What happened
with the girl?

1304
01:02:41,422 --> 01:02:43,290
She's cute, right?

1305
01:02:43,291 --> 01:02:45,593
Yeah.

1306
01:02:45,594 --> 01:02:49,063
She's good for you.

1307
01:02:52,099 --> 01:02:55,703
Like her?

1308
01:02:55,704 --> 01:02:57,141
I...

1309
01:03:00,141 --> 01:03:03,211
What's tomorrow night?

1310
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:09,049
This town, man...
I got to...

1311
01:03:09,050 --> 01:03:13,425
It's beautiful from far away.

1312
01:03:17,425 --> 01:03:19,694
Are you pissed at me?

1313
01:03:19,695 --> 01:03:21,900
Pissed at you?

1314
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:26,806
Sometimes.

1315
01:03:30,806 --> 01:03:38,650
I-I know you're pissed at me
about... about Kate.

1316
01:03:41,650 --> 01:03:43,749
I just can't believe
you never told me that.

1317
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:45,452
I shouldn't have told you
'cause I...

1318
01:03:45,453 --> 01:03:47,493
no. I mean, why didn't you
tell me when it happened?

1319
01:03:48,023 --> 01:03:49,789
I was trying
to protect you, man.

1320
01:03:49,790 --> 01:03:52,063
I didn't want to
get you involved, so, I mean...

1321
01:03:57,599 --> 01:04:00,667
I shouldn't have told you that.

1322
01:04:00,668 --> 01:04:02,469
You've been giving me
fucking an attitude

1323
01:04:02,470 --> 01:04:03,737
ever since I told it to you.

1324
01:04:03,738 --> 01:04:05,237
Well, what do you expect?

1325
01:04:05,238 --> 01:04:07,342
You fucking dropped a bomb on me
that you fucked Kate?

1326
01:04:07,343 --> 01:04:08,542
It's like...

1327
01:04:08,543 --> 01:04:10,343
Okay.
Well, deal with it.

1328
01:04:10,344 --> 01:04:11,779
Like it's nothing.

1329
01:04:11,780 --> 01:04:14,146
Like, you said it like
it was fucking nothing.

1330
01:04:14,147 --> 01:04:16,583
I didn't say it like
it was nothing.

1331
01:04:16,584 --> 01:04:17,883
That's how I heard it.

1332
01:04:17,884 --> 01:04:19,719
- Like it was nothing?
- Yeah.

1333
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:22,655
Well, fuck you, Jon.
It's something to me, okay?

1334
01:04:22,656 --> 01:04:24,456
- Yeah?
- It's none of your fucking business.

1335
01:04:24,457 --> 01:04:25,793
Yeah, it is
my fucking business.

1336
01:04:25,794 --> 01:04:28,596
Do you ever
think about another person?

1337
01:04:28,597 --> 01:04:31,164
You think about what your
fucking actions do to people?

1338
01:04:31,165 --> 01:04:33,099
'Cause I got out of here,
you're fucking mad at me?

1339
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:34,967
- That has nothing to do with it.
- Get out, then. Get out.

1340
01:04:34,968 --> 01:04:36,869
- Why does it always...
- Go work on a fucking fishing boat.

1341
01:04:36,870 --> 01:04:38,505
Why does it come back to that?
I don't want to get out.

1342
01:04:38,506 --> 01:04:41,376
- It's not my fucking fault.
- Maybe I don't want to get out.

1343
01:04:42,376 --> 01:04:44,746
Why do you assume everybody
wants to get out like you?

1344
01:04:44,747 --> 01:04:48,549
Everyone wants to
fucking run away?

1345
01:04:48,550 --> 01:04:49,917
I get it.

1346
01:04:49,918 --> 01:04:54,622
I'm sorry I'm not a...
I don't go to therapy, okay?

1347
01:04:54,623 --> 01:04:55,855
I'm sorry.

1348
01:04:55,856 --> 01:04:59,426
Is that
what I'm saying right now?

1349
01:04:59,427 --> 01:05:00,860
I don't know
what you're saying.

1350
01:05:00,861 --> 01:05:02,095
Why don't you fucking listen
for once in your life?

1351
01:05:02,096 --> 01:05:03,595
You're so much better than me.

1352
01:05:03,596 --> 01:05:04,930
- Yeah.
- Yeah. 'Cause you meditate.

1353
01:05:04,931 --> 01:05:06,566
'Cause I don't
dick my friends over

1354
01:05:06,567 --> 01:05:08,034
and fucking hightail it
out of town.

1355
01:05:08,035 --> 01:05:09,869
I take responsibility
for my fucking life.

1356
01:05:09,870 --> 01:05:11,271
I don't just
leave a fucking trail

1357
01:05:11,272 --> 01:05:13,039
and run away
from my whole fucking life.

1358
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:14,740
You want to go upstairs
and tell him?

1359
01:05:14,741 --> 01:05:16,275
- You want to go?
- No, it doesn't matter.

1360
01:05:16,276 --> 01:05:18,085
You fucking did it.
Why should I tell him?

1361
01:05:23,085 --> 01:05:24,719
Fuck you.

1362
01:05:40,735 --> 01:05:44,805
Sure you're gonna go on
to greener pastures, you know?

1363
01:05:44,806 --> 01:05:47,207
You're gonna
leave that situation

1364
01:05:47,208 --> 01:05:48,374
and you're gonna go

1365
01:05:48,375 --> 01:05:50,242
and you're gonna
find someone else quickly,

1366
01:05:50,243 --> 01:05:53,016
but, you know,
first you have to wait for...

1367
01:05:54,016 --> 01:05:57,484
for some of that situation
to burn off,

1368
01:05:57,485 --> 01:05:59,854
and then you go out and...

1369
01:05:59,855 --> 01:06:02,455
you know, responsibilities.

1370
01:06:02,456 --> 01:06:04,825
I've got Cara, and I...

1371
01:06:04,826 --> 01:06:08,129
Eventually,
I think you just forget

1372
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:12,469
that you even want someone.

1373
01:06:15,469 --> 01:06:17,071
I don't know.

1374
01:06:17,072 --> 01:06:20,741
And you haven't met anybody?

1375
01:06:20,742 --> 01:06:22,375
No.

1376
01:06:22,376 --> 01:06:28,348
But if you might
consider sometime

1377
01:06:28,349 --> 01:06:34,755
maybe going out
to a... Restaurant...

1378
01:06:35,956 --> 01:06:39,225
...or perhaps
to a movie house.

1379
01:06:39,226 --> 01:06:40,493
Movie house?

1380
01:06:40,494 --> 01:06:42,663
A... a cinema.

1381
01:06:42,664 --> 01:06:44,732
I don't know.

1382
01:06:44,733 --> 01:06:49,641
I would... Love that.

1383
01:08:03,844 --> 01:08:07,781
- What?
- This is gonna sound crazy,

1384
01:08:07,782 --> 01:08:11,286
but are you seeing
anybody else right now?

1385
01:08:12,286 --> 01:08:14,955
- No, I'm not.
- You're not. Okay.

1386
01:08:14,956 --> 01:08:16,657
- I'm not.
- All right.

1387
01:08:16,658 --> 01:08:19,360
I just... I've been obsessing
about the whole open thing,

1388
01:08:19,361 --> 01:08:22,328
and I just...
it popped into my mind.

1389
01:08:22,329 --> 01:08:23,364
I don't know why.

1390
01:08:23,365 --> 01:08:25,832
No, it...
it makes total sense

1391
01:08:25,833 --> 01:08:28,068
that would pop into your mind.

1392
01:08:28,069 --> 01:08:30,638
Okay. I just
wanted to check.

1393
01:08:30,639 --> 01:08:32,639
I'm fine.

1394
01:08:32,740 --> 01:08:37,792
- I like you.
- I like you, too.

1395
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:41,975
A reading from
the first letter of St. John...

1396
01:09:41,976 --> 01:09:45,679
"beloved, we receive of him
whatever we ask

1397
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:48,648
"because we keep
his commandments

1398
01:09:48,649 --> 01:09:50,718
"and do what pleases him.

1399
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:52,920
"And his commandment is this...

1400
01:09:52,921 --> 01:09:58,058
"that we should believe in the
name of his son, Jesus Christ,

1401
01:09:58,059 --> 01:10:01,929
"and love one another
just as he created us.

1402
01:10:01,930 --> 01:10:07,468
"Those who keep his commandments
remain in him and he in them.

1403
01:10:07,469 --> 01:10:11,404
"And the way we know
that he remains in us

1404
01:10:11,405 --> 01:10:14,207
"is from the spirit he gave us.

1405
01:10:14,208 --> 01:10:17,577
"Beloved,
do not trust every spirit,

1406
01:10:17,578 --> 01:10:21,881
"but test spirits to see
whether they belong to God

1407
01:10:21,882 --> 01:10:26,021
"because many false prophets
have gone out into the world.

1408
01:10:28,657 --> 01:10:30,990
She's a very nice girl,
and I'm glad that it happened.

1409
01:10:30,991 --> 01:10:32,359
You've said it
like seven times.

1410
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:34,728
I... fuck you.
She's a bartender.

1411
01:10:34,729 --> 01:10:37,664
- No, honestly, I'm happy for you.
- Thank you. I think...

1412
01:10:37,665 --> 01:10:39,831
I've never seen you
glow like this.

1413
01:10:39,832 --> 01:10:41,168
I'm not fucking glowing.

1414
01:10:41,169 --> 01:10:42,803
I'm sweating.

1415
01:10:42,804 --> 01:10:44,202
- I'm not glowing.
- There's a difference?

1416
01:10:44,203 --> 01:10:45,407
- And she's a bartender.
- Hey.

1417
01:10:45,408 --> 01:10:46,806
Hi.

1418
01:10:46,807 --> 01:10:48,208
- How are you?
- I'm good. How are you?

1419
01:10:48,209 --> 01:10:49,209
Good.

1420
01:10:49,210 --> 01:10:51,511
She is a bartender, isn't she?

1421
01:10:51,512 --> 01:10:54,947
Yeah, in Wareham,
and she bartends on Wednesdays,

1422
01:10:54,948 --> 01:10:57,950
- and we'll go and...
- What's the name of the place?

1423
01:10:57,951 --> 01:10:59,154
It's called Moriarty's.

1424
01:11:12,367 --> 01:11:13,567
Hi.

1425
01:11:13,568 --> 01:11:16,636
Hey.

1426
01:11:16,637 --> 01:11:18,471
You okay?

1427
01:11:18,472 --> 01:11:21,742
Yeah, I just...

1428
01:11:21,743 --> 01:11:23,684
I'm just tired.

1429
01:11:29,684 --> 01:11:31,984
Thanks for coming.

1430
01:11:31,985 --> 01:11:33,386
Oh.

1431
01:11:33,387 --> 01:11:39,564
Yeah, I wouldn't have, um,
I wouldn't have missed it.

1432
01:11:42,564 --> 01:11:44,931
I think I had a little bit

1433
01:11:44,932 --> 01:11:48,035
too much to drink downstairs.

1434
01:11:48,036 --> 01:11:50,136
That's good.

1435
01:11:50,137 --> 01:11:51,971
What were you drinking?

1436
01:11:51,972 --> 01:11:53,741
- Bourbon.
- Oh, yeah?

1437
01:11:53,742 --> 01:11:54,943
- Yeah.
- Good.

1438
01:12:29,711 --> 01:12:31,880
How much longer you gonna stay?

1439
01:12:31,881 --> 01:12:33,080
Tomorrow.

1440
01:12:33,081 --> 01:12:36,215
I got to get back.

1441
01:12:36,216 --> 01:12:38,886
Tomorrow? God.

1442
01:12:41,355 --> 01:12:44,268
Yeah.

1443
01:12:53,268 --> 01:12:55,603
It's been really good
to see you, Davey.

1444
01:12:55,604 --> 01:12:58,112
Yeah, it's great to see you.

1445
01:13:04,112 --> 01:13:07,386
You know...

1446
01:13:11,386 --> 01:13:13,353
There's so much

1447
01:13:13,354 --> 01:13:14,921
I want to say to you.

1448
01:13:14,922 --> 01:13:17,056
You know?

1449
01:13:17,057 --> 01:13:19,593
But I, um...

1450
01:13:19,594 --> 01:13:24,203
'Cause I was really mad at you.

1451
01:13:28,203 --> 01:13:29,403
I'm gonna go.

1452
01:13:29,404 --> 01:13:30,871
Hey, wait a minute.

1453
01:13:30,872 --> 01:13:33,341
No, no, I really don't want...
I don't want to. Please...

1454
01:13:33,342 --> 01:13:35,108
hold on a second.

1455
01:13:35,109 --> 01:13:41,247
I left because I thought it was
right for everybody, okay?

1456
01:13:41,248 --> 01:13:43,184
I think about you all time.

1457
01:13:44,385 --> 01:13:47,168
I never stopped.

1458
01:14:11,412 --> 01:14:13,379
Yeah, I think
it's been a long day.

1459
01:14:13,380 --> 01:14:15,113
Sounds like he's sacked out.

1460
01:14:15,114 --> 01:14:16,949
It was nice to see you, though.

1461
01:14:16,950 --> 01:14:18,518
Very nice to see you, too.

1462
01:14:18,519 --> 01:14:20,553
- Yeah. Take care.
- Okay. You, too.

1463
01:14:20,554 --> 01:14:22,073
- Thank you.
- All right. Yeah.

1464
01:14:39,073 --> 01:14:40,306
Hey.

1465
01:14:40,307 --> 01:14:43,911
I'll see you
in the morning, all right?

1466
01:14:43,912 --> 01:14:45,252
Okay.

1467
01:15:05,365 --> 01:15:07,901
- Hey, man.
- What's up, man?

1468
01:15:07,902 --> 01:15:09,102
How you doing?

1469
01:15:09,103 --> 01:15:10,570
Thanks for coming, all right?

1470
01:15:10,571 --> 01:15:11,652
Yeah, of course, of course.

1471
01:15:12,006 --> 01:15:14,507
Look, I'm sorry about
all that shit last night.

1472
01:15:14,508 --> 01:15:16,176
No, no, don't worry about it.

1473
01:15:16,177 --> 01:15:19,412
- That was fucked up.
- It's my fault.

1474
01:15:19,413 --> 01:15:21,881
No.
Look at this guy.

1475
01:15:21,882 --> 01:15:23,250
I know. Right?

1476
01:15:23,251 --> 01:15:26,987
I think he's tired out
from last night.

1477
01:15:26,988 --> 01:15:28,455
Did he get laid?

1478
01:15:28,456 --> 01:15:31,425
- Yeah, he did.
- That's fantastic.

1479
01:15:31,426 --> 01:15:33,193
It's great, right?

1480
01:15:33,194 --> 01:15:36,196
It's good for him.
He needs it.

1481
01:15:36,197 --> 01:15:37,531
Ugh. Fuck.

1482
01:15:37,532 --> 01:15:40,367
So, you psyched
to get out of this snow

1483
01:15:40,368 --> 01:15:43,670
and get back to
the warm weather or what?

1484
01:15:43,671 --> 01:15:45,907
No, it's not that bad.

1485
01:15:47,408 --> 01:15:49,309
Where'd you go last night?

1486
01:15:49,310 --> 01:15:51,144
I just went to Angela's.

1487
01:15:51,145 --> 01:15:52,345
Everything cool?

1488
01:15:52,346 --> 01:15:55,381
Yeah. Fine.

1489
01:15:55,382 --> 01:15:58,751
There he is.

1490
01:15:58,752 --> 01:16:00,890
Ah.

1491
01:16:02,890 --> 01:16:05,426
- It's Davey's last night.
- That's right.

1492
01:16:05,427 --> 01:16:06,426
It is.

1493
01:16:06,761 --> 01:16:09,327
We got to put
our fucking rally caps on.

1494
01:16:09,328 --> 01:16:11,532
- Get out of here.
- I love you, Sammy.

1495
01:16:11,533 --> 01:16:13,300
I love you.

1496
01:16:13,301 --> 01:16:14,599
- Jonny?
- We're gonna do it.

1497
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:16,669
What, we're gonna
fucking not see this guy

1498
01:16:16,670 --> 01:16:18,970
- for 10 more years and...
- No, you'll see me.

1499
01:16:18,971 --> 01:16:20,641
- It's true.
- You'll see me.

1500
01:16:20,642 --> 01:16:22,675
Where we going?

1501
01:16:22,676 --> 01:16:25,412
I happen to know
a bartender in Wareham.

1502
01:16:25,413 --> 01:16:26,880
Why, what's Wareham?

1503
01:16:26,881 --> 01:16:28,647
That's his girl
from last night.

1504
01:16:28,648 --> 01:16:30,116
Oh, I heard about that.

1505
01:16:30,117 --> 01:16:31,549
- Yeah.
- Congratulations.

1506
01:16:31,550 --> 01:16:33,585
It's the end of the world's
longest dry spell.

1507
01:16:33,586 --> 01:16:35,720
- It's not, uh...
- How do you feel?

1508
01:16:35,721 --> 01:16:37,725
I feel better.
I'm not, uh...

1509
01:16:37,726 --> 01:16:39,893
he's like 25 pounds lighter.

1510
01:16:39,894 --> 01:16:43,899
