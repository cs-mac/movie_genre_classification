1
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:17,275
It's due tomorrow.

2
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,909
- What's due tomorrow?
- My paper.

3
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:25,518
What My Dad Does for a Living.
It's due tomorrow.

4
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:26,913
Oh, yeah.

5
00:01:33,726 --> 00:01:37,958
I own a company
that owns a lot of other companies.

6
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:41,259
- What kind of companies?
- Retail mostly.

7
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:47,202
Clothes, shoes, pharmaceuticals,
some high-tech stuff.

8
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:49,864
Okay, but what do you actually do?

9
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:51,135
I make money.

10
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:54,346
And it's difficult to explain
to someone your age.

11
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:40,355
Despite everything...

12
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,887
...I love you, Daddy.

13
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:00,905
Up and at them.

14
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,980
Hey, Jimmy.

15
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:04,974
You're on your way, Dougie.

16
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:06,846
Good luck.

17
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:10,714
Steve.

18
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,380
All right.

19
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:14,054
My man.

20
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:15,353
- Thanks.
- Right, man.

21
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,655
- Good luck.
- Get up, get up. It's Dougie's day.

22
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:21,698
He's getting out. Let's go. Get up.
Hey, Dougie's going. Come on, get up.

23
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,392
Let's go, guys. One, two, three.

24
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,037
Let's go.

25
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:41,682
I don't know why, guys,
but I'm gonna miss you.

26
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:45,590
For about five minutes.

27
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:54,232
Dougie!

28
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:04,634
Later, Dad.

29
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:41,138
Well, you won't be seeing much more
of me anytime soon.

30
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:43,609
- Are you sure?
- That's my girl, man.

31
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:46,149
That karma will come back to you.

32
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,684
- Baby.
- Baby.

33
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:49,185
- Baby.
- Thank you.

34
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:50,481
Hi.

35
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:56,621
I missed you.

36
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:01,764
Baby, before we wear the paint
off the hood of the car...

37
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:04,536
...let's take this somewhere
with a mattress.

38
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:15,438
Oh, baby, this came for you today.

39
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:19,809
Registered mail. Looked important.

40
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:32,931
Baby, what's the matter?

41
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,891
- Hey--
- My father's dead.

42
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:39,928
I thought you were an orphan.

43
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:44,641
Even orphans have fathers somewhere.

44
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:47,405
No, Ma,
I don't care what your landlady said.

45
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,309
What did the--? Ma, what did the--?

46
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:52,178
Ma, what did the doctor say?

47
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,088
Any chance I could talk you
out of a smoke?

48
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:57,882
No chance in hell. Walk away.

49
00:05:58,057 --> 00:06:00,491
Look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mommy.
I'm sorry.

50
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:03,227
You're telling me
that you're going back to a guy...

51
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:07,059
...who's idea of romance
is two-for-one night at the dog track?

52
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:08,962
I'm right here, okay?

53
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:12,229
And I treat you like a goddess.

54
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,696
What do you mean,
"maybe that's my problem"?

55
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:18,537
Hey, I can be a bad boy too
if that's what gets you off.

56
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,736
Hold on, I'm getting another call!

57
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:22,774
No, no, sweetheart, no, no, no.

58
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:25,008
I'm just-- I'm being a bad boy, okay?

59
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:26,583
It was like the role play--

60
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:29,278
Just hold on, I'm sorry. Hold on.

61
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:31,685
Make it quick, okay?

62
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:35,788
What do you mean Rodriguez is gone?

63
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:38,089
Do you mean "gone" gone?

64
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:40,732
Because if that's the "gone"
you're talking about...

65
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,631
...I would appreciate it if you drove
down here and shot me in the face!

66
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:47,932
Because it would be very comforting
for me to be dead right now!

67
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:49,836
- Mikey.
- Hey, Leo, special delivery.

68
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:51,408
Thanks. Look...

69
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:54,705
...Rodriguez is the biggest bail
that I have ever laid out...

70
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:58,647
...in my entire life-sucking,
miserable career and....

71
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,118
Hold on a second.

72
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,892
You know what? It's only money.

73
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:40,021
Come on, buddy, what--?

74
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,952
Son of a--

75
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,598
Jimmy, it's a hit! Get on the floor!

76
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:13,319
-All right, come on. Let's go.
-All right, all right. All right.

77
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:18,294
- Get inside.
- Let's go.

78
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:26,297
Nicely done, boys. Let's giddyup.

79
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:48,184
My God, man.
But you did hit that son of a bitch sweet.

80
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:51,024
But did you have to jack him up
on national TV?

81
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:53,989
- I was frustrated.
- Frustrated?

82
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,430
You look like the poster boy
for bipolar disorder.

83
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:59,298
This guy rapes a 10-year-old
and gets off.

84
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,204
I got a 10-year-old.

85
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:09,715
How I wish you'd have killed him. It would
take the sting out of losing my best cop.

86
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,651
I need your gun, et cetera.

87
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:18,950
I will try to clean this up
and get you back on the job ASAP.

88
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,286
- Sorry, cap.
- Sam, your sister called.

89
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,587
She wanted you to call right back.

90
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:29,030
They expect him to do a lot of reading?

91
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:32,136
Leo, the undertaker thought
it made him look more natural.

92
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:41,078
I can't read it when it's hot.

93
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,572
By the pool on Vegas,
I don't know how they do it.

94
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:50,717
We're talking Baghdad hot
where you're going, old man.

95
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:55,758
- It's a dry heat.
- Will you please show some respect.

96
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:58,892
I need quiet when I read.
He should have plenty of that.

97
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:05,169
- That was funny, kid.
- It wasn't supposed to be funny.

98
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:11,104
- What was your name again?
- Douglas.

99
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,767
Listen to me, all of you.

100
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:17,814
The man that lays here before us
was a very different man in his final days.

101
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:20,612
He changed a great deal for the good.

102
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,913
Yeah, you can tell by the sellout crowd.

103
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:25,455
Then you're gonna have
to take my word for it, Sam.

104
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,025
You'll all get your money
but we stand here quietly!

105
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:30,829
- Okay, okay.
- Pay respect to our father as a family.

106
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:32,589
Understood?

107
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:33,823
- Yup.
- Yeah.

108
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,503
I'm sorry. Okay?

109
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:50,148
I'm sorry.

110
00:10:58,658 --> 00:10:59,989
Don't even think about it.

111
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:21,110
Please.
How much money for you to help me?

112
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,304
Do you understand?

113
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,041
Anything you want.

114
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:30,352
Anything in the world you want
if you help me.

115
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,684
Can you buy me a place in heaven?

116
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,166
Well, we-- Wait, wait.

117
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:44,997
Your father's will reads pretty standard.

118
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:53,505
After a lot of legal mumbo jumbo,
it all boils down to about $3 million.

119
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:56,005
A piece.

120
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:01,050
- What?
- Three million each.

121
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:07,381
Oh, my God, I'm free at last!

122
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,757
Thank you, Lord almighty.
I'm free at last!

123
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:15,767
Substantial estate. I thought he meant,
like, a two-bedroom condo in Boca.

124
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:17,766
A family and money at the same time.

125
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:19,029
What did the old man do?

126
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:23,471
-Did he rob a bank or something?
- It turns out his fifth wife was well-off.

127
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:26,607
Was she sucking on a tailpipe
when he proposed to her?

128
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:29,339
Leo, please.
She loved him very much till she died.

129
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:31,449
The old man's prints were all over that.

130
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:32,811
Oh, good Lord, stop.

131
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:37,115
Daddy left us his money, that's the bottom
line. But there are some contingencies.

132
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:40,190
What contingencies? What are you
talking about? Is it in pesos?

133
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:45,296
Why don't I go get a cup of Joe
and you kids...

134
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:47,728
- ...sort this out.
- Okay.

135
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,560
First of all...

136
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:52,731
...Daddy left me the executor
of the estate.

137
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:55,567
That seems to make a lot of sense.
Somebody we all trust.

138
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:59,108
Yes, because if you give the money
to Leo, he'll piss it away.

139
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:02,545
Look, I know you think
that you're this big, mature man...

140
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:04,580
- ...but I run a business, okay?
- Stop it.

141
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,115
- Stop.
- I'm a business man.

142
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,912
There's more.

143
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:11,183
- Okay.
- You will get the money...

144
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:16,056
...if you work together in a family business
for two years.

145
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:18,258
That's easy.

146
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:30,006
Well.

147
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:32,509
- Douglas, right?
- Yeah.

148
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,838
- Nice knowing you, kid. Have a good life.
- Sam. Oh, Sam.

149
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:37,107
- Nina.
- Sam.

150
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:40,446
I love you very much, Nina,
but this is not funny!

151
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:43,513
Hey, let's open a deli.

152
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:50,887
It was his dying wish
to bring us back together as a family.

153
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:52,587
His dying wish.

154
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:55,063
Doesn't that mean anything to you,
Sam?

155
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:57,862
What are we gonna do together
without killing each other?

156
00:13:58,037 --> 00:13:59,834
- You know your problem?
- I got ideas.

157
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:04,203
You're not a glass-half-empty kind of guy.
You're a shove-the-glass-up-your-ass guy.

158
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:07,868
You figured that this wasn't working
before you even walked in that door.

159
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:10,572
I love family. We haven't
seen each other in 10 years.

160
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:13,377
- We hate each other like it was yesterday!
- Sam, stop it.

161
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:18,216
That reminds me. Just because junior
here is supposedly the old man's seed...

162
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,415
...doesn't mean he's earned a fair share.

163
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:23,653
- He never met the bastard.
- He's Daddy's son, your half brother...

164
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:25,694
...and I have the documents to prove it.

165
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,992
Okay?
You all need this money desperately.

166
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,863
You have alimony,
you have college tuitions up the road...

167
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:34,699
...you are suspended without pay.
And you, you're a bail bondsman, really?

168
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,900
What?
I provide a service to the community.

169
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:40,841
Yeah, in hock up to your eyeballs.
And you, a thief.

170
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:42,708
I'm a good thief.

171
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,578
Like Brad Pitt in Ocean's Eleven.
Maybe you've seen it.

172
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:47,685
I'll be sure to rent the DVD. Thank you.

173
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:50,344
Now I'm not saying
you don't have good reason.

174
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:53,685
But this is a blessing, a second chance
to become a family again.

175
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:59,126
That was his dying wish
and you will honor it even if it kills you.

176
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:02,564
We interrupt this broadcast
for a special report.

177
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,568
Billionaire businessman, Kyle Wills,
was kidnapped today...

178
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,205
... while en route to his office.

179
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:09,432
Eyewitness reports
from shocked onlookers...

180
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:13,840
...described a chaotic scene in which
as many as five armed and masked men--

181
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:16,982
So, what was it like
growing up together, guys?

182
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:22,545
Come on, I grew up in child facilities
and foster homes but had a good time.

183
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:26,552
- You wanna know what it's like?
- Yeah.

184
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:29,091
All right, I'll give you a little taste.

185
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:32,253
You ever played the game
"Got you last"?

186
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,831
- No.
- Oh, it's great, man.

187
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,797
All right, what you do is...

188
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,730
...you hit each other back and forth,
boom, boom, boom...

189
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:42,430
...till one guy gets the other guy
really good.

190
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:46,470
And then you run away
and you say, "Got you last."

191
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:49,910
All right? Then the other guy
chases after you and try to get you back.

192
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:52,516
It starts all over again. Good times.
A lot of fun.

193
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:55,082
Except for when you play it with Sam.

194
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:59,289
Because you know what Sam would do?

195
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,222
I would finally get him once,
real good.

196
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:04,225
And I'd run off.

197
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:06,762
But he wouldn't chase after me.

198
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,601
And then I would live in fear...

199
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:11,793
...for hours, sometimes even days...

200
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:15,429
...wondering when Big Bad Sam
was gonna attack me.

201
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:18,440
And you know what your brother
from another mother would do?

202
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,612
He would set his alarm...

203
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,716
...for 3 a.m...

204
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:27,408
...and walk into my room...

205
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:30,714
...when I was still sleeping
and slap the shit out of me.

206
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:33,991
And I'd be laying there
looking up at this monster...

207
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:38,425
...and he'd lean down
and he'd say, "Got you last."

208
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:41,260
That's the funniest game we played.

209
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:44,561
The rest, I keep between myself
and my therapist.

210
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:48,070
- Grow up.
- Kiss my ass, Sam.

211
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,369
- Got you last.
- You all right?

212
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:57,174
--inside the warehouse,
and then proceeded on their way.

213
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:58,407
A homeless woman...

214
00:16:58,584 --> 00:16:59,608
I'm gonna kill you!

215
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:02,618
...identified Edgar Rodriguez
as one of the Wills kidnappers.

216
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:06,685
According to the FBI,
Rodriguez is an escaped fugitive...

217
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,588
...facing charges for grand theft--

218
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:10,388
That's my bail skip.

219
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:13,326
The Wills family is offering
a 5 million-dollar reward...

220
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:17,435
...for any information directly resulting
in the billionaire's safe return.

221
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:32,408
Take this.

222
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:35,985
Ten mils of Valium.
You'll think you're at Club Med.

223
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:37,520
I don't need this.

224
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:41,284
I'm doing you a favor. Now, take it
or I'll shove it down your throat.

225
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,451
Okay.

226
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:47,190
So all of our communications
with the FBI...

227
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:49,800
...are done through computer.

228
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:53,170
Very high-tech,
you wouldn't understand.

229
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:55,738
You're only good
at destroying computer companies.

230
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,069
Don't know jack shit
about how to use them.

231
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,870
May I talk with my family, somehow?

232
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:03,606
Will you please shut up?
You think I'm some kind of ogre?

233
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:06,816
See the camera? What do you think
I bought that for, numbnuts?

234
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:10,087
They see you, you see them,
everybody cries, beg for mercy...

235
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,745
...et cetera, et cetera.

236
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:15,382
Now, the feds are gonna wanna
make sure that you're alive.

237
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:19,019
So I've rigged a live feed
of the Dow Jones stock ticker...

238
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:20,722
...to run across the screen.

239
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:23,364
That way,
you can read real time stock quotes...

240
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:26,504
...and see just how far
your company's gone in the toilet...

241
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:29,573
...because their leader
is about to die a horrible death...

242
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:31,572
...unless they pay up.

243
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:33,108
It's cool, huh?

244
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:36,608
Okay.

245
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,775
Leo needs a favor.

246
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:44,079
Yeah.

247
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:46,656
I was thinking,
until we figure out what it is...

248
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:49,658
...that we could do
as a "family business," you know...

249
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:52,695
...I've got a little situation
I could use a little help with.

250
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:54,127
How can I help, bro?

251
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:58,096
"Bro?" What are you, 12 years old?

252
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,363
Next, you're gonna be asking me
to high-five.

253
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:03,337
Leo, do you want help or not?
Beggars can't be choosers.

254
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:05,438
Right. Sorry.

255
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:11,607
Turns out, since I won't be getting
at the old man's cut for two years...

256
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:14,183
...I'm in a little bit of a financial bind.

257
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:18,719
See, I posted this bond
on this guy, Edgar Rodriguez...

258
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:22,019
...for $250,000 and he skipped on me.

259
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:24,626
If he doesn't show up
for his trial next week...

260
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:26,559
...I'm on the hook for the $250,000.

261
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:28,962
- This is a nightmare.
- I know. Tell me about it.

262
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:30,601
But the good news is...

263
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:33,431
...it seems Rodriguez is involved
with that kidnapping...

264
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:36,631
...that's all over the news,
so we got that going for us.

265
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:38,833
EcoSummit down 44.

266
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,342
Smith & Yale down four.

267
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,537
Solomon Gold up 16.

268
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:46,241
Volume's light, 630 million shares.

269
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:49,216
Susan, Janson, I'm okay.

270
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:51,356
Janson. Janson, I want--

271
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:57,051
He knows we can trace it.
We'll never get any more than that.

272
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:02,525
The old man's probably laughing
his ass off.

273
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,566
You know this was his plan all along.

274
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:06,067
No, it wasn't, okay?

275
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:09,207
He knew it would take that long.
Especially with you.

276
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:12,207
Sammy the bullheaded,
you're just like him.

277
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:18,640
You're the only one on this planet...

278
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:21,718
...I would let compare me to him.
I want you to know that.

279
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:25,113
What would you do?

280
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:28,953
Slap me around like one of your perps,
huh?

281
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:31,618
Now, wouldn't that bring down
the wrath of God?

282
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,722
You should have been a nun.

283
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,261
Yeah.

284
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:38,426
Cheated on my husband,
ruined my marriage...

285
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:40,572
...and ex-communicated from the church.

286
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:43,140
I got two failed marriages.

287
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:45,970
A kid who barely knows me.
I'm damned to hell for sure.

288
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:48,479
Chips off the old block, huh?

289
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:49,978
That's bogus, though.

290
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:53,481
You know, it's time you grew up
and just stopped blaming him.

291
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:58,348
Now, it's up to us.

292
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,589
I love my brothers...

293
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,457
...unconditionally, even you.

294
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,262
Even the one I just met.

295
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,730
Really? What's his name?

296
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:11,493
Douglas.

297
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:15,231
- He seems very sweet.
- For a juvenile delinquent.

298
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:18,274
Well, you're no prince either
and I still love you.

299
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,775
That's kind of how family works.

300
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:24,507
- You're actually gonna help me out?
- FBI's gonna throw every agent at this.

301
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:27,481
Wills is a huge contributor
to the Republican party.

302
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:29,245
They're gonna find Rodriguez.

303
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:32,652
No, but they're not gonna be looking
for Rodriguez, not just yet.

304
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:36,385
They know this guy is not smart enough
to pull off something this big.

305
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:39,257
He's nothing but a lieutenant
with the cartels in Mexico.

306
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:42,696
So interfere with FBI investigation
and be killed by the cartels?

307
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:45,894
Yeah,
but there's a 5 million dollar reward.

308
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:48,835
But we're not looking for Wills
so there is no 5 million.

309
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:50,599
So we split your bond.

310
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:53,108
That's what, 10 percent on 250 grand?

311
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:57,146
Twenty-five grand split three ways
is 8,333 and change.

312
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,715
No, listen, Einstein.

313
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:02,479
The deal was we work together, okay?
We split the old man's money.

314
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:03,848
That bond is mine.

315
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:06,456
No, no. This counts as part
of our two-year sentence.

316
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,593
The deal was,
anything the company makes...

317
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,456
...gets split three ways. That's the deal.

318
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:14,191
Tell me what you know.

319
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:18,127
Slow down, turbo.
I see the way things are going here.

320
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:21,670
You're snapping out orders
and expecting the two of us to just eat shit.

321
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,640
No. Nina said that we work together
as a team.

322
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:27,802
Oh, well, thank you, John Wooden.

323
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:29,810
I'm a cop. That's what I do.

324
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:33,178
Along the way, I'll figure out what
contribution you make to the team.

325
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,014
- Until then, I'm stumped.
- Please. Please.

326
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:37,821
Listen.

327
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:41,489
Rodriguez was running his mouth off
about this girl that he was dating.

328
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,150
This famous stripper in Mexico.

329
00:22:43,328 --> 00:22:45,387
Know how many strip clubs
are in Mexico City?

330
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:47,589
She's famous, right?
That narrows it down.

331
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:50,428
Angelina. Angelina. That was her name.

332
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:53,298
It was a singular name, like Madonna.

333
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:56,873
Sam, just hear me out, okay?
Hear me out.

334
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,669
If Rodriguez is involved...

335
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:01,335
...he's involved
because of his connections...

336
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:03,037
...to the cartel in Mexico.

337
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:07,049
So it's my guess that
that's where they're hiding Wills.

338
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,759
We're gonna need money to get started.

339
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:19,860
So how much do you need?

340
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:21,966
Fifteen thousand.

341
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:25,365
That will get us started.
I'll call you when we need more.

342
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:28,865
- Fifteen grand?
- Yeah.

343
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:32,373
Well, you know,
I plan running a tight ship, Sam.

344
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:37,038
I do not wanna dip into Daddy's funds
until you've all proven yourself a bit.

345
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:41,779
So 10,000 will have to do, no more.

346
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:46,023
You're being a little tight with 12 million,
don't you think?

347
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,081
It's not our money yet.

348
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,161
The company needs to prove itself,
it has to be successful.

349
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:53,320
I think 10,000 is fair.

350
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:57,732
Okay. You hold the purse strings.
We'll see how it goes.

351
00:23:57,903 --> 00:23:59,097
Okay.

352
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:02,570
Well, you will be careful, won't you?
I mean, you'll look after them?

353
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:04,106
They're grown-ups, Nina.

354
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:08,007
- I'll do my job, I'm not a babysitter.
- No, I know, but they are your family.

355
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,580
I'd keep pushing the money angle
if I were you, kid.

356
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:11,807
I'll see you in a week.

357
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:16,516
Yeah.

358
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:34,095
So, Sam, what's first?

359
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:36,797
We take a little nap
and then we hit the strip clubs.

360
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,739
It's pretty much my normal routine
in every new town.

361
00:24:39,911 --> 00:24:42,072
No. We call every club in town...

362
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:45,580
...and see if they've a famous
one-name stripper, Angelina.

363
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:49,379
Should take about a lifetime. Moron.

364
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:55,382
It might not take as long
as you guys think.

365
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:57,150
Edgar is a very dangerous man.

366
00:25:57,556 --> 00:26:01,617
He would easily kill me
if he thought I was a help to you.

367
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:06,261
I haven't seen him
since he left for America...

368
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:08,024
...over a month ago.

369
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:11,726
Listen, Angelina. You don't have
to be afraid of him anymore, okay?

370
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,427
Because we can protect you.

371
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:16,039
No, we can't.
Don't offer anything you can't deliver.

372
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:19,643
It wouldn't matter. I can't help you.
I'm sorry.

373
00:26:37,128 --> 00:26:38,993
Yeah, get him, Little Joe!

374
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:41,830
No, no, no. Come on.

375
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,298
Listen, Angelina,
I wrote down my cell number.

376
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:48,667
If you ever need anything at all,
don't hesitate to call.

377
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:53,101
Oh, my God.

378
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,303
That was like a bad Bonanza episode?

379
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,038
What is a Bonanza episode?

380
00:26:57,215 --> 00:26:59,775
Oh, man, it's this great television show
about this guy.

381
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:02,044
He had three sons,
all from different mothers.

382
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,279
Very, very relatable to our situation.

383
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:07,755
Sammy and l, we would sit and watch
the reruns when we were younger.

384
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:11,885
And pretty much the only time when we
weren't beating each other up, right?

385
00:27:12,063 --> 00:27:14,031
- A stupid show.
- No, it was a great show.

386
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:18,192
It was classic, iconic television.
I can't believe you've never seen Bonanza.

387
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,338
- They didn't have Nick at Nite?
- No.

388
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:23,035
You would be a perfect
Little Joe, man.

389
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:24,368
- The youngest.
- Yeah.

390
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:27,170
- Who would you be? Hoss?
- No, no. You're Hoss.

391
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:29,210
Big pecs, Popeye forearms. Perfect.

392
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:31,849
Hoss was defined by his stupidity
rather than size.

393
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:33,484
And a middle child, you be Hoss.

394
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,984
- Eat me.
- Thanks for helping me out in there, Sam.

395
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,348
Like a big brother should.

396
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:40,154
Brothers? I'm a cop.
I was stopping a homicide.

397
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:42,559
Wow, you're a dick.

398
00:27:43,194 --> 00:27:45,185
It's cool. It's cool. I don't care.

399
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:49,825
Look, the bottom line is,
we have nothing on Rodriguez.

400
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:53,266
Not necessarily. She gave me
her apartment number, told me to stop by.

401
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:55,463
She said she was having a party.

402
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:06,015
Don't press too hard for information.
She's scared.

403
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,276
Take it nice and easy.

404
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:09,579
Look, you're sending a boy
to do a man's job.

405
00:28:09,754 --> 00:28:11,244
She asked for the kid. Not you.

406
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:14,620
I know, but it's a party.
So I could go up there and I could mingle--

407
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:16,658
Whatever. Anything in that apartment...

408
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:18,887
...anything that gets us closer
to Rodriguez.

409
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:20,088
Okay.

410
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:23,029
All right, I'll do my best.
Wish me good luck.

411
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,192
Yeah, right. Just go.

412
00:28:26,971 --> 00:28:30,907
She's gonna chew him up
and spit him out.

413
00:28:49,594 --> 00:28:51,357
- Hello.
- Hello.

414
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:55,122
- I thought there was a party?
- There is.

415
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,269
- Am I early?
- No.

416
00:28:58,536 --> 00:29:00,197
You are the party.

417
00:30:12,443 --> 00:30:13,967
Thank you.

418
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:15,737
Thank you, Jesus...

419
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:17,609
...for answering my prayers.

420
00:30:17,782 --> 00:30:19,340
Oh, you make too much of it.

421
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:23,419
I've got a certain gift, for sure,
but, yeah, you know.

422
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:35,993
Edgar.

423
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,363
I will kill your young friend...

424
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:40,800
...and make love one last time
before I kill you.

425
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:42,166
Edgar, you said tomorrow!

426
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,035
Because I'm early, this is okay?

427
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:45,506
Edgar, please.

428
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,338
Kill me, but not him.

429
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,173
He's an innocent and blessed by God.

430
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,880
Well, there goes Leo's 200 grand.

431
00:31:00,758 --> 00:31:03,056
Yeah, he's gonna be disappointed.

432
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,504
What happened?

433
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:23,036
- What's going on?
- What did you guys get?

434
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:26,479
Rodriguez's mother lives in a small town
called Vista Del Fuego.

435
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:28,312
Him and her are pretty close.

436
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:31,114
He told Angelina he was going to America
for a big score.

437
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:33,655
Wait. Who told you this?
Was somebody at the party?

438
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:36,123
It's Angelina. She was pretty nice.

439
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:39,229
Wait, I don't get it.
She was all buttoned up at the strip club.

440
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:41,627
- What made her change her mind?
- She was....

441
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:43,858
- Vulnerable.
- What's that supposed to mean?

442
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:45,059
- Leo.
- What?

443
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:46,794
Rodriguez is dead.

444
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:48,302
What do you mean?

445
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:50,464
The kid was in the sack
with his girlfriend.

446
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:52,439
Rodriguez showed up,
I had to shoot him.

447
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:55,807
You were sleeping with the famous strip--
What did you just say?

448
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:59,472
Did you say you shot Rodriguez?
What about my $200,000?

449
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:02,415
We're gonna go after Wills
for the 5-million-dollar reward.

450
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:05,055
All we need is information
leading to his safe return.

451
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:07,487
Rodriguez had to know
where they're hiding Wills.

452
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:09,559
Unfortunately, you shot him.

453
00:32:09,727 --> 00:32:11,820
Pretty fortunate
from where I was standing.

454
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:14,597
Laying. You were laying, Romeo.

455
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,200
Here's his wallet.
See if you can find anything.

456
00:32:17,368 --> 00:32:19,461
We get a lead,
we call the American Embassy...

457
00:32:19,637 --> 00:32:23,073
...we cash in on the $5,000,000,
and we get on with our separate lives.

458
00:32:32,383 --> 00:32:35,147
I have no idea where we are.

459
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:39,286
Headed northeast, this is the only road.
We're gonna make it there eventually.

460
00:32:42,393 --> 00:32:44,088
So, what do you think of the kid?

461
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:46,496
No way he came
from the old man's loins.

462
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:48,022
Why do you say that?

463
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:49,800
He's not a big enough asshole.

464
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:53,230
Are you actually admitting
you're an asshole?

465
00:32:53,404 --> 00:32:55,395
- We're both assholes.
- No.

466
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:57,541
Don't drag me
into your personal nightmare.

467
00:32:57,709 --> 00:32:59,267
I happen to be a very decent guy.

468
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:06,049
Just because a drunk admits he's a drunk
doesn't make him any more sober.

469
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:09,152
Just trying to bond with you, Leo.
I heard misery loves company.

470
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:14,482
It works the same with misery or without.
It just depends on the company, asshole.

471
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:24,864
Leave all your valuables in the truck.

472
00:33:25,036 --> 00:33:27,869
One vacancy
in this entire pissant town?

473
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:30,872
Come on, what is this?
A convention destination?

474
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:34,170
I've slept on bathroom floors
that were bigger than that hotel room.

475
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:37,007
I had a cell in juvie
that was, like, 6-by-6.

476
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:39,411
You have to double up
in a place like that.

477
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:42,712
It was a slow week, thank God.
I had the whole place to myself.

478
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:46,015
- I'm pretty lucky like that.
- Yeah, a regular horseshoe up your ass.

479
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:49,250
There's no way I'm sleeping in a bed
with either one of you guys.

480
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:51,088
- Fine. Sleep in the truck.
- Come on.

481
00:33:51,262 --> 00:33:54,095
I'll take the floor,
you guys take the beds.

482
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:57,092
Listen to him, man. He's a puppy dog.

483
00:33:57,268 --> 00:34:00,533
He's cute, cuddly, chicks dig him,
and he'll sleep on the floor.

484
00:34:04,942 --> 00:34:08,935
Guys, we gotta be careful.
We stick out like sore thumbs in this town.

485
00:34:09,113 --> 00:34:12,446
Man, it's beautiful here.
I wish I spoke Spanish.

486
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:14,676
I wanna immerse myself
in the local culture.

487
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:23,158
How's that for local culture? Dive in.

488
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:25,190
Puppy dog.

489
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,813
Señora Rodriguez?

490
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:49,777
Habla English?

491
00:34:49,954 --> 00:34:51,421
You speak any English?

492
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:54,281
- No.
- Señora Rodriguez.

493
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:02,096
We got a bilingual brother.
That's gonna come in handy here.

494
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:04,234
Now he can get us killed
in two languages.

495
00:35:04,702 --> 00:35:05,828
Excuse me.

496
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:23,845
No, no, no.

497
00:35:27,825 --> 00:35:28,849
See if that helps.

498
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:48,210
Ask about the woman in the picture.
She may be in danger.

499
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:50,279
- Mama.
- Hey, kid.

500
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:16,998
Rodriguez is dead.

501
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,699
They tracked him down here.

502
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:21,344
You gonna sit there
and tell me you had this figured?

503
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,912
Leave them little pieces of cheese
to find us with?

504
00:36:24,081 --> 00:36:25,480
Make it more interesting?

505
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:33,622
An FBI agent was quoted in the article.
The bureau is claiming no responsibility.

506
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:34,883
And you believe them?

507
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:37,554
I worked for them 10 years.

508
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:41,663
They'll consider it a huge failure
if they don't bring Wills back alive.

509
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:44,729
Whoever killed Rodriguez
doesn't give a damn about Wills.

510
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,367
Let me worry about it, will you?

511
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:51,165
Okay. But while you're worrying,
get off my computer.

512
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:53,537
It took me a month
to put in money transfers...

513
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:57,272
- ...and you're gonna crash it playing cards.
- All right.

514
00:36:57,448 --> 00:36:59,382
If feds didn't kill Rodriguez, then who?

515
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:03,611
In the world Rodriguez lives in,
I'm sure the list is endless.

516
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:06,517
It doesn't matter, it's not connected.

517
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:10,422
Yeah. Except now Rodriguez is dead,
we're in the middle of Mexico.

518
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:13,063
We don't have the Mexican
who brought us to the dance!

519
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:16,792
We don't need him anymore.
It's all preset.

520
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:20,301
But you know what? Why don't we send
Bertram and Bermutti into town.

521
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:22,530
See if anyone
has been looking around.

522
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:40,716
Hey.

523
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:43,325
You speak Spanish, you do the talking.

524
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:47,561
What, Sam?
You saying you need me all of a sudden?

525
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:51,793
No. For some reason, you sound smarter
when I don't know what you're saying.

526
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:54,871
Hey, could you teach me?

527
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:57,839
- What?
- Spanish.

528
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:00,309
Yeah, I'll loan you the tapes.

529
00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:04,470
I got it. Thanks.

530
00:38:06,984 --> 00:38:09,509
- Hello.
- Can I help you?

531
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:13,054
Really? You speak English?

532
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:15,488
Theresa,
we're friends with Edgar Rodriguez.

533
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,458
- He said you may be able to help us.
- He's dead.

534
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,959
Did you know
that about your friend Edgar?

535
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:23,857
Are you police?

536
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:27,801
Gee, everybody is just paranoid
about the cops around here, aren't they?

537
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:31,203
- I guess it crosses all borders, right?
- We're not the police.

538
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:33,935
You hear anything
about the kidnapping of the American?

539
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:35,135
I can read.

540
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,012
If you're not police, you should leave.

541
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:41,515
Or my grandfather is going to blow
a hole through this door and ruin it.

542
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:43,313
Yup, in that case, I lied.

543
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:46,687
Just heard
Mexicans are friendly people.

544
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:49,724
I'm half Indian. We're not so friendly.

545
00:38:54,732 --> 00:38:57,929
- I haven't seen Edgar in two years.
- Your picture was in his wallet.

546
00:38:58,102 --> 00:39:01,333
I assure you, you won't find
a picture of him in my wallet.

547
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,973
- You can check.
- No, there's no need.

548
00:39:04,775 --> 00:39:07,539
- She's telling the truth.
- Got a crystal ball up your ass?

549
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:10,010
- How's that fit with the horseshoe?
- I just know.

550
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:12,706
- But I can only do it with women--
- You're not a cop.

551
00:39:12,883 --> 00:39:15,477
No, I'm not a cop.
I'm his brother and his brother too.

552
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:18,144
- She doesn't need to know.
- How do you know Rodriguez?

553
00:39:18,322 --> 00:39:20,517
- We grew up together.
- We don't know anything...

554
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:23,091
...about your country,
but we could use some help.

555
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:26,661
There's a reward for information
leading to the return of the American.

556
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:29,698
- We'll pay an equal share.
- An equal share? Are you crazy?

557
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:32,495
- Ten percent, max.
- I want no part of it.

558
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:36,069
When I found out Edgar died,
I felt nothing.

559
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:42,835
- lf she is lying, she's damn good.
- She's not lying.

560
00:39:44,348 --> 00:39:46,043
It's time for you to leave.

561
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:50,715
See, that's great. Back to square one.

562
00:39:51,455 --> 00:39:52,547
Charmed.

563
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:55,521
Sorry. We're just kind of
out of our place here.

564
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:58,685
- You're very kind. Thank you.
- Thank you very much. Okay.

565
00:40:00,765 --> 00:40:02,995
Thought they take your badge
when they fire you.

566
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:06,227
I wasn't fired, I was suspended.
I keep an old badge just in case.

567
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:07,530
- Hey, kid.
- Yeah?

568
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:11,801
Rule number one in team play:
Never tell anybody anything until we talk.

569
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:14,206
Okay. Would you have
asked her for help?

570
00:40:14,378 --> 00:40:16,471
- No.
- Oh, but it's completely okay...

571
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:19,411
...for you to offer a complete stranger
an equal share.

572
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:22,347
What the hell is that?
You know, there's no I in team, Sam.

573
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:26,115
Yeah, but there's an I in family,
and I'm still the oldest, so shut up.

574
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:33,328
You wanna know what's going on
in a neighborhood...

575
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:34,725
...go to a local bar.

576
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:38,630
This is the type of local bar that you go to
if you wanna get shot for no reason.

577
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:41,533
You speak the language, Leo.
They'll respect that.

578
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:45,505
You bet. How do I beg for my life in
Spanish? Just so-- What are you doing?

579
00:40:45,676 --> 00:40:48,110
This is how you beg for your life
in Spanish.

580
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:51,339
- Good God, Leo. You hunting a bear?
- You got a license for that?

581
00:40:51,515 --> 00:40:54,075
I'm a bail bondsman,
not a kindergarten teacher.

582
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:57,420
Packing that little baby cop peashooters
of yours?

583
00:40:57,588 --> 00:40:59,419
- It will do.
- All right.

584
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:01,080
You got anything you can use?

585
00:41:01,258 --> 00:41:04,318
- I don't care for guns, man.
- You'll make a fine-looking corpse.

586
00:41:04,495 --> 00:41:07,362
Tell you what, just stay here
and keep the engine running.

587
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:08,896
Yeah.

588
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:12,458
Be careful.

589
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:37,288
Yeah, it's a grande mamón.

590
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:40,587
What was that about?

591
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:43,798
You know, see what me
speaking the language does?

592
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:46,730
It turns the whole table around,
puts me in control.

593
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:48,997
And I can see how much you hate it.

594
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:51,835
It's not a competition.
You'll get your head blown off...

595
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:54,876
- ...in a place like this.
- All right, fair enough.

596
00:41:55,246 --> 00:42:00,206
All right, basically, you want me to pretend
like you wanna buy drugs?

597
00:42:01,418 --> 00:42:03,386
- When in Rome.
- Okay.

598
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:05,886
See if you can get something
from the bartender.

599
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:07,515
Hey.

600
00:42:09,493 --> 00:42:10,687
Yeah.

601
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:32,712
Right.

602
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,475
Well....

603
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:43,188
Right? You would.

604
00:42:51,602 --> 00:42:53,001
Okay.

605
00:43:08,552 --> 00:43:10,611
- Crap.
- Gentlemen.

606
00:43:10,788 --> 00:43:13,120
Your friend here was double-parked.

607
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:15,588
- Put your weapons on the bar.
- You heard him.

608
00:43:31,642 --> 00:43:34,167
We think the American, Kyle Wills,
may be hidden here.

609
00:43:34,478 --> 00:43:38,175
- You assume I've something to do with it?
- No. You have no motive.

610
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:41,148
Good.
At least you are not a stupid policeman.

611
00:43:43,754 --> 00:43:46,018
- What then?
- lf Rodriguez was to bring him here...

612
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:48,488
...he'd ask for your permission
out of respect.

613
00:43:48,659 --> 00:43:49,683
Maybe good sense.

614
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:51,953
Rodriguez had no respect,
very little sense.

615
00:43:52,229 --> 00:43:56,495
He worked for me. He wanted to be me.
Can you blame him?

616
00:43:56,667 --> 00:43:58,999
Will the kidnappers be here
without you knowing it?

617
00:43:59,169 --> 00:44:02,161
If they are here, it's because
Rodriguez knew where to hide them.

618
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:05,638
- Where I would have no concern.
- Does that place exist?

619
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:09,301
- Where people aren't afraid of you?
- To know me is to be afraid.

620
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,347
If within a thousand miles in any direction,
they know me.

621
00:44:12,516 --> 00:44:15,314
- Is there a place of no concern to you?
- Simple.

622
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:18,011
A places where the soil is not fertile.

623
00:44:18,188 --> 00:44:19,712
I am a farmer, remember?

624
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,519
- What about Indian land?
- Doubtful.

625
00:44:22,893 --> 00:44:24,690
They have their holy places.

626
00:44:24,862 --> 00:44:27,330
But there, the Indians
would have killed them by now.

627
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:28,897
Maybe the canyons.

628
00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:32,399
If Wills is here, the U.S. government
is gonna bring more heat on you...

629
00:44:32,569 --> 00:44:35,629
...than you can afford.
I wanna find him first. I need your help.

630
00:44:35,806 --> 00:44:39,298
Even if I had something to do with it,
your government cannot prove it.

631
00:44:39,476 --> 00:44:41,410
You'll be dropped off back at your hotel.

632
00:44:41,578 --> 00:44:44,741
If you're not gone in 24 hours,
you will die here.

633
00:44:49,653 --> 00:44:51,177
Hey, hey.

634
00:44:58,729 --> 00:45:01,197
- Who were they?
- I don't know, you pig!

635
00:45:05,602 --> 00:45:08,036
You're gonna tell me,
you're gonna tell me right now.

636
00:45:15,813 --> 00:45:17,610
Father, no!

637
00:45:25,189 --> 00:45:27,555
I'm not getting out of this truck
without my hat.

638
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:29,625
I'm not getting out without it.

639
00:45:29,793 --> 00:45:31,920
Hey! Hey! Is that necessary?

640
00:45:35,132 --> 00:45:37,293
I want my hat!

641
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:40,564
- What do we do now?
- Get out of here.

642
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:43,832
Are you kidding me?
What about my money, huh?

643
00:45:44,007 --> 00:45:47,875
I go back to work in three weeks.
This is ridiculous.

644
00:45:48,045 --> 00:45:49,273
No. No.

645
00:45:49,446 --> 00:45:51,880
Are you really gonna walk away
on this whole thing?

646
00:45:52,049 --> 00:45:53,880
Three million dollars for each of us...

647
00:45:54,051 --> 00:45:59,580
- ...but I don't get my piece without you.
- It ain't worth getting killed over.

648
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:03,958
- It is for me.
- Give it up, Leo.

649
00:46:04,128 --> 00:46:06,096
- I've got nothing left!
- Hey.

650
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:08,458
Hey. Sam.

651
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:13,002
Sam, at least think about it
on your way home, man.

652
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:15,161
Getting a chance to meet my family
meant--

653
00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:17,671
We ain't family!

654
00:46:17,841 --> 00:46:21,800
If there's no money involved in this,
we never meet.

655
00:46:21,979 --> 00:46:23,708
What does that tell you?

656
00:46:24,148 --> 00:46:27,914
I don't care about the money.
I'm just glad to meet you guys.

657
00:46:28,085 --> 00:46:31,054
I just wish I could've met my dad too,
man.

658
00:46:31,221 --> 00:46:33,212
Let me bring you up to speed
on your family.

659
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:34,721
Your dad?

660
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:37,656
An abusive drunk and a sex addict.
Four kids, four mothers.

661
00:46:38,595 --> 00:46:40,028
All right.

662
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:42,659
Did you at least get a chance
to meet your mom?

663
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:44,494
Yeah. Stripper.

664
00:46:44,668 --> 00:46:47,933
Raised me for three years,
put me on a doorstep. See you, bye.

665
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:50,205
All right.

666
00:46:50,707 --> 00:46:51,731
What about Leo's mom?

667
00:46:51,909 --> 00:46:55,640
Cleaning lady for dad's bookie.
Died during childbirth.

668
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:58,714
Don't worry, him and Nina's mom
had a pretty good run.

669
00:46:58,882 --> 00:47:00,543
Three, four years.

670
00:47:00,717 --> 00:47:02,548
They were drunk the whole time.

671
00:47:10,894 --> 00:47:12,191
Hey.

672
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:22,461
- He must have had good qualities.
- Sure.

673
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:26,075
He'd only beat up Leo because he
wouldn't hit a girl and was afraid of me.

674
00:47:26,243 --> 00:47:27,733
Wait.

675
00:47:30,814 --> 00:47:32,372
I rigged the door.

676
00:47:32,549 --> 00:47:35,211
Kids were always sneaking
into your rooms in juvie.

677
00:47:36,987 --> 00:47:39,148
Could be somebody still there,
wired the room.

678
00:47:39,323 --> 00:47:42,383
You gave him a key and told the room
because it's not broken into.

679
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:46,427
Please. Please, a man was here
looking for you, but he's gone.

680
00:47:46,597 --> 00:47:51,057
- Verdugo's men?
- No. No. American. I did not know him.

681
00:48:00,244 --> 00:48:01,734
Open it.

682
00:48:13,957 --> 00:48:15,015
You see?

683
00:48:15,192 --> 00:48:16,352
Nothing.

684
00:48:20,297 --> 00:48:21,628
Wait. Get down!

685
00:48:35,512 --> 00:48:39,107
This your idea of an express checkout,
asshole?

686
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,714
It's the same guys
who kidnapped Wills.

687
00:48:41,885 --> 00:48:44,683
They know Rodriguez is dead
and somehow made the connection.

688
00:48:44,855 --> 00:48:46,254
How did they know it was us?

689
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:50,086
Because we're the only morons
with bull's-eyes on our foreheads.

690
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,887
Do you still need help?

691
00:48:54,498 --> 00:48:55,829
What are you doing here?

692
00:48:57,601 --> 00:49:00,934
These men that worked with Edgar,
Americans...

693
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:04,562
...they came looking for you.
They killed my grandfather.

694
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:08,136
- Man, oh, man.
- I know every trail, road and canyon...

695
00:49:08,312 --> 00:49:09,939
...for a hundred miles.

696
00:49:23,393 --> 00:49:25,088
We're gonna need guns.

697
00:49:34,571 --> 00:49:35,697
Leo, get in the back.

698
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:41,136
Stop here. We're close.

699
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:55,022
It used to be a weapons depot
for the military.

700
00:49:55,192 --> 00:49:56,318
Now Verdugo uses it.

701
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:59,257
- He's gonna kill us anyway.
- How are we gonna get in there?

702
00:49:59,429 --> 00:50:03,160
They gotta have some sort of, like,
security system, or fancy locks--

703
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:07,064
No. Don't worry about it.
You take care of the guards, I'll get you in.

704
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:23,552
Señor.

705
00:50:47,844 --> 00:50:49,869
Don't know why we don't just shoot
the lock.

706
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:52,311
It's gonna be a lot faster
if I just shoot it off.

707
00:50:52,482 --> 00:50:55,110
Yeah. If the gunshot
doesn't bring the whole town down...

708
00:50:55,285 --> 00:50:57,219
...your big mouth is going to. Shut up.

709
00:50:59,089 --> 00:51:01,114
Hey, guys,
you mind giving me some room?

710
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:03,782
- Yeah. Oh, sorry. Yeah.
- Yeah.

711
00:51:04,761 --> 00:51:07,525
- Where did you learn that?
- I met a guy when I was a kid.

712
00:51:07,697 --> 00:51:08,925
We called him Uncle Jimmy.

713
00:51:09,499 --> 00:51:11,364
He's the best B & E man in the country.

714
00:51:12,536 --> 00:51:15,699
He taught me
how to get in and out of anything.

715
00:51:31,521 --> 00:51:33,318
Hey, guys, come in.

716
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:34,752
Oh, my God.

717
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:38,588
This must be what Charlton Heston's
first wet dream looked like.

718
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:41,925
This will definitely do.

719
00:51:42,566 --> 00:51:45,194
Someone is gonna have to show me
how to use one of these.

720
00:51:45,368 --> 00:51:48,804
You know what, kid?
I have absolutely no idea.

721
00:51:48,972 --> 00:51:51,600
But I bet big bad Sammy the cop
will show you.

722
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:53,606
No, sir, only the bad guys get these.

723
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:56,302
Grab a high-powered automatic rifle,
some grenades.

724
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,005
Leo, don't blow yourself up.

725
00:52:08,925 --> 00:52:10,517
How do you feel, boss?

726
00:52:12,863 --> 00:52:14,296
Sorry.

727
00:52:14,898 --> 00:52:15,990
Well.

728
00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:19,431
Well, listen to you.

729
00:52:19,669 --> 00:52:22,832
I do believe that apology is sincere.

730
00:52:23,006 --> 00:52:25,497
I mean, there's nothing
like a peek at mortality...

731
00:52:25,675 --> 00:52:27,836
...to sharpen hindsight, huh?

732
00:52:31,281 --> 00:52:33,681
My life has been about money.

733
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:38,246
I have trouble seeing past it.

734
00:52:38,421 --> 00:52:39,683
Don't tell me.

735
00:52:39,856 --> 00:52:44,725
And now you're wondering
if money is what life is all about, huh?

736
00:52:47,931 --> 00:52:50,161
That's clichéd, man.

737
00:52:51,401 --> 00:52:52,891
But I'm with you.

738
00:52:53,937 --> 00:52:55,837
Because that is the question.

739
00:52:56,473 --> 00:52:58,668
Is the money enough?

740
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:04,814
I mean, is anything less
than blowing your head off enough?

741
00:53:06,316 --> 00:53:09,012
Because that's the thing
about blowing somebody's head off.

742
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:11,848
Oh, boy, it is definitely enough.

743
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:21,056
If you're gonna kill me,
could I say goodbye to my family first?

744
00:53:21,231 --> 00:53:23,699
What? Tell them you love them,
that sort of nonsense?

745
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:29,505
Yes. Please.

746
00:53:30,006 --> 00:53:31,030
Wow, that is touching.

747
00:53:32,976 --> 00:53:34,000
Yes.

748
00:53:38,815 --> 00:53:40,043
Relax, will you?

749
00:53:41,184 --> 00:53:43,709
I couldn't even figure out how to load it.

750
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:46,583
I'm not really a gun kind of guy.

751
00:53:56,499 --> 00:53:58,763
Only one road takes us close
to the canyons...

752
00:53:58,935 --> 00:54:02,063
...and they'll see us coming for miles.
We'll need horses.

753
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:05,731
Wait-- No, no. Horses?
No, I don't do horses, guys. Okay?

754
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:07,574
You any good on a horse, kid?

755
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:10,770
Yeah. I spent a few years
on a work ranch for delinquents.

756
00:54:10,947 --> 00:54:12,847
Heigh-ho, Silver.

757
00:54:13,016 --> 00:54:16,315
The Mennonites have the best horses.
Supplies, clothing also.

758
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:17,778
Mennonites?

759
00:54:17,954 --> 00:54:20,218
My ass hurts already.

760
00:54:31,568 --> 00:54:32,592
Over here.

761
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:34,168
Sir?

762
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:38,301
I'm gonna need a real gentle one.

763
00:54:38,475 --> 00:54:39,942
Like--

764
00:54:40,377 --> 00:54:41,901
I'd like to smell the glue.

765
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:45,479
- Okay.
- The roan is beautiful.

766
00:54:45,649 --> 00:54:48,015
An excellent choice. You know horses.

767
00:54:48,184 --> 00:54:51,483
You got one
where my feet can still touch the ground?

768
00:54:57,727 --> 00:54:59,126
She won't take a saddle.

769
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:04,959
- Yeah. She's been abused.
- Abused?

770
00:55:05,702 --> 00:55:06,930
No.

771
00:55:07,103 --> 00:55:09,094
Some require a firm hand.

772
00:55:12,842 --> 00:55:14,639
Yeah, she's been burnt by the hobbles.

773
00:55:18,014 --> 00:55:19,845
Her ribs are bruised.

774
00:55:20,016 --> 00:55:22,712
Whipped pretty hard on the backside,
and maybe kicked even.

775
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:27,788
- Is that your idea of a firm hand?
- This horse almost killed a man once.

776
00:55:28,258 --> 00:55:29,987
I don't doubt that.

777
00:55:31,695 --> 00:55:32,889
Maybe you can do better.

778
00:55:33,063 --> 00:55:34,257
Yeah.

779
00:55:34,431 --> 00:55:37,332
Well, you don't deserve this horse
or any other. We'll take it.

780
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:40,693
Come here. You stay there.

781
00:55:42,706 --> 00:55:45,539
Yeah. Yeah.

782
00:55:47,744 --> 00:55:48,836
Listen, I got it.

783
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:52,004
I'll let you take care of that, Sam.
Go right ahead.

784
00:55:58,455 --> 00:56:00,047
That's my brother, you know.

785
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:07,553
- You don't seem like brothers.
- Yeah. Tell me about it.

786
00:56:09,232 --> 00:56:11,723
He's pretty good with that horse, though,
ain't he?

787
00:56:11,901 --> 00:56:14,426
I've seen that kind of training before.

788
00:56:14,604 --> 00:56:16,435
Very gentle.

789
00:56:17,307 --> 00:56:18,365
Thattagirl.

790
00:56:19,142 --> 00:56:20,871
Are you a policeman too?

791
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:22,170
No.

792
00:56:22,345 --> 00:56:23,573
No, no, no.

793
00:56:23,747 --> 00:56:26,682
Not me. Just Sam.

794
00:56:28,351 --> 00:56:30,319
Is he a good one?

795
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:33,617
I'm sure he is.

796
00:56:34,324 --> 00:56:36,690
He's good at everything he does.

797
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:39,457
Except people.

798
00:56:47,003 --> 00:56:49,096
Sorry about your grandfather.

799
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:06,748
What do you think of Little Joe now,
huh?

800
00:57:13,229 --> 00:57:15,390
The kidnappers gotta be talking
to the FBI.

801
00:57:15,565 --> 00:57:18,125
There's no phone lines,
no cell phones to trace.

802
00:57:18,301 --> 00:57:21,896
Unless scrambled through a computer.
Wireless phone modems and cell phone.

803
00:57:22,071 --> 00:57:24,562
- E-mails.
- Hold up. Hold up.

804
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:27,574
They're gonna need a generator.
Generators powered by gas.

805
00:57:28,244 --> 00:57:30,678
Only one gas depot
between here and the canyons.

806
00:57:30,847 --> 00:57:33,008
- Can you find it?
- I'm Indian, remember?

807
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:34,514
Like your cowboy movies.

808
00:57:34,684 --> 00:57:38,313
I get down, put my ear to the ground,
smell the horse dung, sniff the wind.

809
00:57:38,488 --> 00:57:40,012
That's all we're good for, right?

810
00:57:42,258 --> 00:57:45,955
What's wrong with Hiawatha?
Wake up on the wrong side of the bedroll?

811
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:50,024
Considering what she's been through,
maybe we could cut her some slack, huh?

812
00:57:50,333 --> 00:57:52,358
Come on. Come on.

813
00:57:52,535 --> 00:57:56,972
Yeah, I guess Little Joe is right.
That was kind of stupid.

814
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:59,506
You know what's stupid?
The whole Bonanza thing.

815
00:57:59,676 --> 00:58:01,075
That's stupid.

816
00:58:03,947 --> 00:58:07,474
You must have cared about him once.
A long time ago.

817
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:10,312
Edgar was like my father.

818
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:14,446
He protected me from the things
he knew I would not tolerate.

819
00:58:14,924 --> 00:58:16,050
You mean he lied to you?

820
00:58:16,359 --> 00:58:18,293
That's what I mean.

821
00:58:19,128 --> 00:58:22,222
When I found out the true nature
of what he did, I left.

822
00:58:22,398 --> 00:58:23,626
Again, like my father.

823
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,859
What is it that your father did?

824
00:58:27,036 --> 00:58:29,004
Verdugo worked for him.

825
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,605
Hey!

826
00:58:31,241 --> 00:58:34,904
How do you get these things to go
if they don't want to?

827
00:58:35,578 --> 00:58:39,036
The gas depot is over the next rise.
About a mile.

828
00:58:39,215 --> 00:58:41,809
All right, we'll rest near here
and we wait for dark.

829
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:55,689
That is one gorgeous woman, ain't it?

830
00:58:56,332 --> 00:58:58,061
Definitely.

831
00:58:59,802 --> 00:59:04,034
Hey, tell me, little brother,
how do you do it, huh?

832
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:05,765
With the ladies, I mean.

833
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:11,336
I'm not asking
because I need pointers or anything...

834
00:59:11,514 --> 00:59:14,950
...but good Lord knows
that I do just fine on my own but--

835
00:59:15,118 --> 00:59:18,281
I'm just asking artist to artist, like....

836
00:59:19,022 --> 00:59:20,353
What's your technique?

837
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:23,851
Well, Leo, I really don't like to talk
about stuff like that.

838
00:59:24,027 --> 00:59:26,086
It kind of kills the magic.

839
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:32,126
Wow,
I wasn't meaning locker room B.S.

840
00:59:32,302 --> 00:59:34,361
I was trying to bond, brother to brother.

841
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:36,932
Apparently, never mind.

842
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:42,271
All right, well....

843
00:59:42,445 --> 00:59:44,845
- You wanna know what the thing is?
- Yeah.

844
00:59:45,014 --> 00:59:48,006
The way I get my joy, my satisfaction...

845
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:51,617
...is how intense and complete
the woman's joy is.

846
00:59:51,955 --> 00:59:54,583
If the woman seems very giving...

847
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:59,126
...it's because I'm acutely attuned
into her every need.

848
00:59:59,996 --> 01:00:01,588
But in reality...

849
01:00:01,898 --> 01:00:04,128
...it's selfishly motivated.

850
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:15,240
I guess that could work.

851
01:00:28,224 --> 01:00:31,284
Leo, stay here with Theresa.
Me and the kid are gonna look around.

852
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:34,191
Wait. Why do I have to stay here?

853
01:00:35,098 --> 01:00:36,998
- She'll protect you.
- Oh, come on.

854
01:00:37,166 --> 01:00:40,795
- I'm the one that speaks Spanish.
- Not gonna talk to them, just look around.

855
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:43,200
Hey, go, Leo, I could stay with Theresa.

856
01:00:43,373 --> 01:00:46,399
- I think we all know where that's going.
- Don't be an idiot, Leo.

857
01:00:46,576 --> 01:00:48,840
Listen to the kid.
Starting to sound like family.

858
01:00:49,012 --> 01:00:50,070
We could all go.

859
01:00:50,246 --> 01:00:53,374
No. I'm gonna go alone.
Less of a change I can get spotted.

860
01:00:53,549 --> 01:00:55,949
No offense, Sam,
but you're pretty easy to spot.

861
01:00:56,119 --> 01:00:57,518
I don't want you getting shot.

862
01:00:57,687 --> 01:01:01,145
And that neon cowboy hat on your fat head
isn't helping either.

863
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:03,622
- What, you're worried about me, Leo?
- No.

864
01:01:03,793 --> 01:01:06,489
I just don't the shot
giving away our position.

865
01:01:56,245 --> 01:01:57,542
Well, if you'll excuse me.

866
01:01:57,714 --> 01:02:01,445
I think this might be a good time for me
to freshen up.

867
01:02:01,684 --> 01:02:07,122
Be careful
because human feces is an aphrodisiac...

868
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:10,282
...for the great brown Mexican grizzly.

869
01:02:11,594 --> 01:02:13,619
Thanks for the tip.

870
01:02:24,207 --> 01:02:26,641
He doesn't have the arrogance
of most men I've known.

871
01:02:28,978 --> 01:02:30,377
Well...

872
01:02:30,847 --> 01:02:32,439
...he can be pretty selfish.

873
01:02:32,615 --> 01:02:34,378
You know, he's just a kid, remember?

874
01:02:38,187 --> 01:02:42,180
Your brother, Sam?
He seems hardened.

875
01:02:42,358 --> 01:02:43,382
Yeah.

876
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:45,925
Yeah. It's because he is.

877
01:02:46,796 --> 01:02:49,924
Hard-nosed, hardheaded...

878
01:02:50,533 --> 01:02:51,830
...hard to get along with.

879
01:02:52,001 --> 01:02:54,765
But you, you are none of those things?

880
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:57,735
Hardened, selfish? Nothing like that?

881
01:02:58,174 --> 01:03:00,233
No. No, it's because I'm a giver.

882
01:03:01,177 --> 01:03:03,737
Give, give, give, always give,
never take.

883
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:06,005
You seem very insecure.

884
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:10,241
What?
Where did you pick that up, huh?

885
01:03:10,419 --> 01:03:13,252
Some psych class at the local Jaycee
or is that all Dr. Phil?

886
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:14,988
Who is Dr. Phil?

887
01:03:16,759 --> 01:03:19,751
You need a satellite
to get Dr. Phil out here.

888
01:03:20,496 --> 01:03:24,455
No, no, no. Hey, it's okay.
Look, it's okay, all right? Just relax.

889
01:03:25,835 --> 01:03:27,769
- Your friends, where they at?
- Yeah?

890
01:03:27,937 --> 01:03:29,268
What friends?

891
01:03:31,674 --> 01:03:34,973
The ones riding the other horses.

892
01:03:35,144 --> 01:03:36,702
I'm a cowboy.

893
01:03:39,782 --> 01:03:40,874
Those are my horses.

894
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:43,951
I ride one son of a bitch to death
and then I got a backup.

895
01:03:45,955 --> 01:03:49,152
Tell me or Bernardo
is going to have to cut your girlfriend.

896
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:52,150
No, no, no. I'm taking her to Verdugo.

897
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:54,319
If you hurt her, he'll kill all of us.

898
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:56,897
Verdugo is the one that sent us.

899
01:04:00,002 --> 01:04:01,469
Last chance.

900
01:04:01,637 --> 01:04:04,333
I mean, if I kill her,
she can't have my kids.

901
01:04:05,908 --> 01:04:06,966
No, no, no, okay.

902
01:04:08,344 --> 01:04:09,538
Okay.

903
01:04:09,712 --> 01:04:11,475
I gave it my best shot.

904
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:13,839
Wait, I'll be honest now, okay?

905
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:17,751
One of my friends
is right behind your partner.

906
01:04:22,825 --> 01:04:24,486
Theresa, you okay?

907
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:26,719
Leo. Leo, you all right?

908
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:30,257
I lost a tooth.

909
01:04:30,433 --> 01:04:31,695
I definitely broke a rib.

910
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:34,029
And my ass really hurts
from that damn horse.

911
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:36,569
But you were cool, man.
You were definitely cool.

912
01:04:36,839 --> 01:04:37,999
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

913
01:04:38,174 --> 01:04:39,539
- You think so.
- Yeah.

914
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:42,772
- You were cool too, brother.
- Who the hell are these guys?

915
01:04:42,945 --> 01:04:45,140
You should've seen Leo.
He wouldn't give us up.

916
01:04:45,314 --> 01:04:47,248
- No.
- Verdugo sent them.

917
01:04:47,416 --> 01:04:51,580
I bet there's more after them. Listen,
I saw a map, a town called Platzcurro?

918
01:04:51,754 --> 01:04:53,221
I got the coordinates.

919
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:57,223
Patzcurro is half a day's ride
on horseback. Maybe an hour by truck.

920
01:04:57,393 --> 01:04:59,861
Then we go now.
Listen, you keep my horse with you.

921
01:05:00,029 --> 01:05:01,758
If that truck is leaving, I'm on it.

922
01:05:01,931 --> 01:05:04,695
What if we run into where they keep
Wills? They'll kill him.

923
01:05:04,867 --> 01:05:08,769
The money, only way they get it
is if they keep him alive. They'll kill us first.

924
01:05:08,938 --> 01:05:13,375
- What if they think we're the FBI?
- The FBI won't come in on horseback.

925
01:05:13,542 --> 01:05:17,376
That's a good point. All right,
so we stick to the plan. We find Wills.

926
01:05:17,546 --> 01:05:22,381
We call the American Embassy,
go home, and wait for our check.

927
01:05:23,185 --> 01:05:26,586
Is that all this is about for you?
The money?

928
01:05:26,989 --> 01:05:30,789
I didn't mean it like-- As long as
we're here, the money is not a bad thing.

929
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,120
We should get ready.

930
01:05:32,295 --> 01:05:34,820
I didn't mean it like that, Theresa.

931
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:36,596
Come on. You meant well.

932
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:42,734
I had a dream last night...

933
01:05:42,905 --> 01:05:45,931
...the guys who killed Rodriguez,
whoever they are...

934
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:48,634
...were just a myth

935
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:53,442
Yeah.

936
01:05:53,616 --> 01:05:58,144
I dreamed you orchestrated the thing,
so we wouldn't have to split the money.

937
01:06:00,589 --> 01:06:02,079
I'm not that clever.

938
01:06:03,259 --> 01:06:04,692
Don't underestimate yourself.

939
01:06:49,772 --> 01:06:51,000
Not much.

940
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:54,306
You understand you habla too much,
I kill you?

941
01:06:56,479 --> 01:06:57,810
Good.

942
01:07:09,492 --> 01:07:12,290
Rise and shine, pumpkin head.

943
01:07:12,795 --> 01:07:14,592
That's what my mother used to say.

944
01:07:14,764 --> 01:07:18,564
If all goes as planned, you should be back
with your pseudo loved ones...

945
01:07:18,734 --> 01:07:20,258
...by happy hour tomorrow night.

946
01:07:20,436 --> 01:07:22,768
At which point,
I will be halfway to handsome.

947
01:07:22,938 --> 01:07:25,031
Before you do
whatever it is you've planned...

948
01:07:25,207 --> 01:07:27,437
...will I be able to talk to my son?

949
01:07:27,777 --> 01:07:29,711
You're sure we're gonna kill you, huh?

950
01:07:30,179 --> 01:07:32,670
- Crossed my mind.
- Well, you're wrong...

951
01:07:32,848 --> 01:07:37,410
...again. You took 50 million from me,
I take 500 million from you.

952
01:07:37,586 --> 01:07:40,851
Which I would've had
if I invested the 50 mil in the first place.

953
01:07:41,023 --> 01:07:43,253
Swear to God. It's an eye for an eye.

954
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:44,890
Biblical, man.

955
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:51,898
- Move in right now!
- Don't let it go!

956
01:08:02,978 --> 01:08:05,674
- No.
- No, no, no.

957
01:08:07,116 --> 01:08:08,811
To relax.

958
01:08:12,955 --> 01:08:14,354
Hello.

959
01:08:14,523 --> 01:08:20,155
I'd like to speak to the agent in charge
of the Lyle Wills kidnapping investigation.

960
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:24,960
Yes, I think I can be of help.

961
01:08:26,368 --> 01:08:27,665
Thank you.

962
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:41,008
- You said a few minutes, goddamn it.
- It's only been a few minutes.

963
01:08:41,484 --> 01:08:44,476
What's the matter?
Is the Iceman having a meltdown?

964
01:08:46,755 --> 01:08:51,749
Got it. I got it, baby.
I'm all set up for the transfer.

965
01:08:51,927 --> 01:08:54,623
Now, we just gotta put our buddy here
online...

966
01:08:57,066 --> 01:08:58,863
...and the party gets started.

967
01:08:59,235 --> 01:09:01,795
Get out of the way.
Move out of the way. Here we go.

968
01:09:05,741 --> 01:09:08,175
I think Sam just pulled up
with the gas truck.

969
01:09:08,544 --> 01:09:10,876
Just look for the guy
with the dorky cowboy hat...

970
01:09:11,046 --> 01:09:14,174
...and with the King Kong shoulders.

971
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:15,874
- See him.
- Yup.

972
01:09:35,137 --> 01:09:37,867
Strato Entertainment,
down four and an eighth.

973
01:09:38,541 --> 01:09:41,169
CoreCell, down a half.

974
01:09:41,677 --> 01:09:44,043
SoloNET, down two and change.

975
01:09:44,213 --> 01:09:48,445
Can you back the hell off please?
I can't even hear myself think here.

976
01:09:53,455 --> 01:09:54,479
Janson.

977
01:09:54,957 --> 01:09:56,049
Yeah, Dad?

978
01:09:57,259 --> 01:10:01,320
I wanted to tell you what I do for a living.
For your report.

979
01:10:02,431 --> 01:10:04,262
I turned it in, Dad.

980
01:10:04,433 --> 01:10:05,661
I made some stuff up.

981
01:10:07,603 --> 01:10:08,763
I'm sorry.

982
01:10:09,905 --> 01:10:11,839
But I'd still like to know.

983
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:13,232
Got it.

984
01:10:13,943 --> 01:10:15,342
Here we go.

985
01:10:15,511 --> 01:10:18,071
All we gotta do is split it up
and we're out of here.

986
01:10:49,878 --> 01:10:51,243
You're insane, Sam.

987
01:10:51,413 --> 01:10:52,778
My God, what just happened?

988
01:10:52,948 --> 01:10:53,972
What was that?

989
01:10:54,283 --> 01:10:56,513
Get out of the way! Get out there!

990
01:10:56,952 --> 01:10:59,386
We split up.
Make them think that there's more of us.

991
01:10:59,688 --> 01:11:01,952
Where--?
My husband, what happened to him?

992
01:11:02,391 --> 01:11:05,417
Jeez, it's not us.

993
01:11:05,594 --> 01:11:07,619
We're headed there now.

994
01:11:07,796 --> 01:11:10,128
The Black Hawks
the Mexican military promised us...

995
01:11:10,299 --> 01:11:12,790
...are both down
with mechanical problems so....

996
01:11:13,168 --> 01:11:16,228
Commercial helicopters are at least
two hours out from Mexico City.

997
01:11:16,405 --> 01:11:18,032
Copy that.

998
01:11:20,075 --> 01:11:22,509
It all starts with an idea, right?

999
01:11:22,678 --> 01:11:25,238
These people come up with ideas.

1000
01:11:25,748 --> 01:11:28,239
Good people, good ideas.

1001
01:11:28,417 --> 01:11:29,941
That's how you start a business.

1002
01:11:47,903 --> 01:11:49,996
Anybody see anything?

1003
01:11:50,572 --> 01:11:53,700
I can see the future. You're not in it.

1004
01:11:54,109 --> 01:11:55,542
Drop it.

1005
01:11:57,279 --> 01:11:58,303
Where's Wills?

1006
01:11:58,580 --> 01:11:59,604
Dead.

1007
01:12:00,249 --> 01:12:01,273
You're late.

1008
01:12:01,450 --> 01:12:03,577
If he was dead,
you would've moved on by now.

1009
01:12:07,189 --> 01:12:09,054
The one with Sam
killed my grandfather.

1010
01:12:23,138 --> 01:12:25,038
You must be the guy
that killed Rodriguez.

1011
01:12:25,207 --> 01:12:27,505
You picked the wrong horse, bubba.

1012
01:12:38,821 --> 01:12:39,845
Kill them both.

1013
01:13:19,194 --> 01:13:20,559
Got it. Done.

1014
01:13:21,196 --> 01:13:22,925
- That's what my company does.
- Done.

1015
01:13:23,098 --> 01:13:25,760
You make it sound like charity work,
you puke.

1016
01:13:25,934 --> 01:13:27,697
- Janson--
- Hey, look, kid.

1017
01:13:27,870 --> 01:13:29,895
Then your old man fires all the people...

1018
01:13:30,172 --> 01:13:33,198
...then brings in teams of lawyers
and private investigators...

1019
01:13:33,375 --> 01:13:34,706
... to ruin everybody's lives.

1020
01:13:34,877 --> 01:13:37,710
Trust me,
I know from firsthand experience.

1021
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:41,441
- That's what your old man does.
- We have to go now!

1022
01:13:42,684 --> 01:13:45,050
- Janson, l--
- Do you do that, Dad?

1023
01:13:48,757 --> 01:13:50,782
Yes. Yes.

1024
01:13:53,228 --> 01:13:55,093
That's what I do.

1025
01:14:08,010 --> 01:14:09,443
Go, go, go!

1026
01:14:23,992 --> 01:14:26,586
Theresa and Leo check the grounds.
I go after the Bronco.

1027
01:14:26,762 --> 01:14:28,889
- Through the mountains.
- Bronco doesn't matter.

1028
01:14:29,064 --> 01:14:31,828
It matters to Theresa.
That guy killed her grandfather.

1029
01:14:32,901 --> 01:14:34,300
Just don't get hurt.

1030
01:14:43,645 --> 01:14:44,771
Hey....

1031
01:14:50,619 --> 01:14:52,052
What?

1032
01:15:11,006 --> 01:15:12,496
Verdugo.

1033
01:15:13,141 --> 01:15:14,733
Crap.

1034
01:15:50,012 --> 01:15:51,104
Señor Wills?

1035
01:15:57,519 --> 01:15:59,578
This. This is unacceptable.

1036
01:16:00,289 --> 01:16:01,688
Are you with the FBI?

1037
01:16:02,090 --> 01:16:06,390
No, no. I'm here to escort you to them.

1038
01:16:08,864 --> 01:16:10,058
You are safe now.

1039
01:16:10,532 --> 01:16:11,692
You are in safe hands.

1040
01:16:23,946 --> 01:16:26,881
All right, before they beat you,
I know you had it in you, okay?

1041
01:16:27,049 --> 01:16:29,108
Now, you show me. Come on! Let's go!

1042
01:18:09,117 --> 01:18:10,607
Hey.

1043
01:18:11,953 --> 01:18:14,649
- Lost a lot of blood there, Little Joe.
- You okay, kid?

1044
01:18:15,323 --> 01:18:17,257
Hey, Sam.

1045
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:19,422
You find Wills?

1046
01:18:23,165 --> 01:18:27,465
Verdugo came and turned him over
to the FBI like a good Samaritan.

1047
01:18:28,737 --> 01:18:30,705
Okay, so, what does that mean for us?

1048
01:18:30,872 --> 01:18:31,930
It means we're broke.

1049
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:34,603
I got to admit, though.

1050
01:18:34,776 --> 01:18:39,236
Seeing that asshole tits up,
that was worth a million bucks, right?

1051
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:45,117
Unfortunately, it doesn't bring
my grandfather back, does it?

1052
01:18:54,396 --> 01:18:58,560
I can't-- I just can't catch a break
with this broad, can l?

1053
01:19:00,001 --> 01:19:02,060
Try keeping your mouth shut.

1054
01:19:14,483 --> 01:19:18,715
Hey, hey. Wait! Wait!

1055
01:19:18,887 --> 01:19:20,047
Wait a minute.

1056
01:19:20,689 --> 01:19:23,920
I didn't come all this way
to die of exhaustion, okay?

1057
01:19:24,359 --> 01:19:27,260
Give me five minutes, okay?

1058
01:19:31,366 --> 01:19:36,167
Well, I guess
this is as good a place as any.

1059
01:19:42,444 --> 01:19:43,741
Hey, get out of my stuff.

1060
01:19:44,212 --> 01:19:46,510
- Sit down!
- What? Hey!

1061
01:19:46,681 --> 01:19:49,946
What are you doing? What--?
Oh, come on, guys.

1062
01:19:50,418 --> 01:19:52,909
Put those down. Come on.

1063
01:19:54,422 --> 01:19:55,616
Is this the backup?

1064
01:19:57,459 --> 01:19:59,051
The backup flash drive, this is?

1065
01:19:59,227 --> 01:20:02,162
That's it. That's all we need.
Come on. Let's get going.

1066
01:20:02,330 --> 01:20:04,264
I don't have to-- I don't have to sit.

1067
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:08,531
Hey, what are you, insane?
What's the matter--?

1068
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:10,534
- Sit down, you pathetic--
- Wait, wait.

1069
01:20:10,939 --> 01:20:12,497
- Okay.
- You were right.

1070
01:20:12,674 --> 01:20:16,132
- Oh, wait.
- I underestimated myself.

1071
01:20:16,511 --> 01:20:19,139
Oh, come on.

1072
01:20:19,548 --> 01:20:20,947
Why didn't I see this?

1073
01:20:21,116 --> 01:20:22,515
Stop talking.

1074
01:20:24,319 --> 01:20:25,843
Please tell my mother--

1075
01:20:28,290 --> 01:20:29,985
That's them.

1076
01:20:30,859 --> 01:20:34,488
I saw them meet-up at the canyon.
It was just too dark to bring them down.

1077
01:20:35,197 --> 01:20:37,222
Only an Indian
could guide them through.

1078
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:42,227
They must have some plan of getting
picked up or transported from there.

1079
01:20:42,671 --> 01:20:44,400
Unless we can get him before sunrise.

1080
01:20:44,573 --> 01:20:48,065
We have maybe four hours before dawn.
After that, they're gone.

1081
01:20:48,243 --> 01:20:49,267
No, what? What?

1082
01:20:49,444 --> 01:20:51,605
What are you guys talking about?

1083
01:20:52,314 --> 01:20:57,308
No, no, no. The guy that killed
your grandfather is already dead, okay?

1084
01:20:57,485 --> 01:21:01,285
We're-- I'm not gonna get my money back.
We have no shot at the reward money.

1085
01:21:01,456 --> 01:21:05,324
Wills is back with his family.
Our job is done here.

1086
01:21:06,661 --> 01:21:09,721
Do you see anybody else out here
that's gonna go after him, Leo?

1087
01:21:10,098 --> 01:21:12,066
What's that got to do with anything,
Sam?

1088
01:21:12,234 --> 01:21:16,193
- I'm a cop. I don't get to walk away.
- You're not a cop. You got suspended.

1089
01:21:16,371 --> 01:21:18,532
I'm not asking you to go.
Stay with the kid.

1090
01:21:18,707 --> 01:21:20,902
- Fine.
- I told you I'm fine. I can go.

1091
01:21:21,243 --> 01:21:24,178
Oh, that's just great.
Now, you're gonna get the kid killed too.

1092
01:21:24,346 --> 01:21:27,281
You know, just when I was starting
to like your dumb ass.

1093
01:21:27,449 --> 01:21:30,009
No, I'm not letting you take him
with you.

1094
01:21:30,185 --> 01:21:33,348
His leg, it's about to fall off.
What are you gonna do? Carry him?

1095
01:21:33,521 --> 01:21:35,785
- Jeez, Leo, shut up!
- No, I won't shut up!

1096
01:21:35,957 --> 01:21:38,118
It's crazy, Sam!

1097
01:21:40,595 --> 01:21:42,495
- You know what, Sam?
- What?

1098
01:21:42,664 --> 01:21:47,533
It baffles me that you're not capable
of walking away from being a cop...

1099
01:21:47,702 --> 01:21:50,569
...yet you're completely fine
with walking out on me...

1100
01:21:50,739 --> 01:21:52,604
...and your little sister.

1101
01:21:55,810 --> 01:21:59,906
- So that's what this is all about, Leo?
- You left us alone with him.

1102
01:22:00,448 --> 01:22:05,613
You have absolutely no idea
how bad it got when you were gone.

1103
01:22:05,787 --> 01:22:09,814
Now, now, Nina, you know her.
She probably forgave you by now...

1104
01:22:09,991 --> 01:22:11,549
...but me?

1105
01:22:13,828 --> 01:22:18,288
You were the one
that was taking care of us, not him!

1106
01:22:19,768 --> 01:22:22,828
I expected nothing from him, but you?

1107
01:22:26,308 --> 01:22:28,435
You know the funny thing?

1108
01:22:30,111 --> 01:22:32,477
Eventually, he sobered up.

1109
01:22:36,117 --> 01:22:38,677
You never came back, Sam.

1110
01:22:38,987 --> 01:22:42,946
It's crazy how much you resent the guy
because...

1111
01:22:44,359 --> 01:22:46,657
...you're just like him, Sam!

1112
01:22:46,828 --> 01:22:48,455
Hey!

1113
01:22:49,130 --> 01:22:50,154
Come on.

1114
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:53,634
I got you last!

1115
01:22:53,802 --> 01:22:57,169
What are you gonna do, huh? Do it!

1116
01:22:57,339 --> 01:22:59,068
Do it!

1117
01:23:01,076 --> 01:23:02,941
Come on!

1118
01:23:09,818 --> 01:23:11,979
I was 17 years old.

1119
01:23:13,488 --> 01:23:15,547
If I'd have stayed, I'd have killed him.

1120
01:23:17,058 --> 01:23:18,525
Sorry.

1121
01:23:48,890 --> 01:23:50,448
Marcus Canton.

1122
01:23:50,625 --> 01:23:53,150
We're going to have to move faster.

1123
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:56,959
- How's the leg, kid?
- It's good enough.

1124
01:24:11,046 --> 01:24:14,709
It will be difficult for the horses
the rest of the way in the canyons.

1125
01:24:14,883 --> 01:24:18,341
- You think they're looking for him?
- I don't know. It's not military.

1126
01:24:22,190 --> 01:24:23,350
Maybe that's his way out.

1127
01:24:23,525 --> 01:24:25,220
Head down in case he doubles back.

1128
01:24:25,393 --> 01:24:28,055
They won't be able to land
at the bottom of the canyons.

1129
01:24:28,229 --> 01:24:30,288
- They're gonna pull him out.
- Right.

1130
01:25:54,716 --> 01:25:57,776
- You okay?
- I'm fine. Go.

1131
01:26:23,178 --> 01:26:24,338
Morning.

1132
01:26:24,779 --> 01:26:27,077
What brings you
to this neck of the woods?

1133
01:26:28,917 --> 01:26:30,145
You're under arrest.

1134
01:26:44,199 --> 01:26:47,032
Never walk out on family, Sam.

1135
01:26:49,337 --> 01:26:51,168
You're absolutely right.

1136
01:26:53,741 --> 01:26:57,677
Nice going. What is it? Horse?

1137
01:26:58,012 --> 01:26:59,570
No, it's Hoss.

1138
01:27:00,748 --> 01:27:04,206
- And I'm not Hoss.
- I can't be Hoss, I'm the oldest.

1139
01:27:04,852 --> 01:27:06,683
By process of elimination, you're Hoss.

1140
01:27:06,854 --> 01:27:12,588
Fine, if only by process of elimination,
then I can live with that.

1141
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:28,300
- Are you sure there's nothing we can do?
- Yeah, I mean, the FBI...

1142
01:27:28,476 --> 01:27:31,934
...they said that we're good
for at least $250,000 of the reward money.

1143
01:27:32,113 --> 01:27:34,843
And in my opinion,
I think you more than earned your share.

1144
01:27:35,016 --> 01:27:37,246
That's 25 percent.

1145
01:27:37,418 --> 01:27:39,943
I mean, I'm assuming
that's okay with you guys.

1146
01:27:40,121 --> 01:27:41,281
- Absolutely.
- Seems fair.

1147
01:27:41,456 --> 01:27:42,753
- Yeah.
- No, please, I'm fine.

1148
01:27:43,524 --> 01:27:44,991
Come on.

1149
01:27:46,461 --> 01:27:47,894
All right, come here.

1150
01:27:48,663 --> 01:27:49,994
- Careful.
- Thank you.

1151
01:27:50,164 --> 01:27:52,598
I'm sorry,
I know it's been a couple of days.

1152
01:27:52,767 --> 01:27:54,325
All right, take care.

1153
01:27:54,502 --> 01:27:56,766
- Thank you.
- Get her, cowboy.

1154
01:27:56,938 --> 01:27:58,337
Take care.

1155
01:28:00,475 --> 01:28:01,669
I'll miss you.

1156
01:28:04,779 --> 01:28:07,179
I'd like to come back to visit
if that's okay.

1157
01:28:07,348 --> 01:28:11,045
Leo is gonna lend me his Spanish tapes,
he says.

1158
01:28:11,219 --> 01:28:13,483
I think I'd like that very much.

1159
01:28:14,956 --> 01:28:16,480
Take care.

1160
01:28:17,425 --> 01:28:18,983
Bye.

1161
01:28:34,876 --> 01:28:38,141
Oh, it was amazing. And this guy,
he's probably going back there.

1162
01:28:38,313 --> 01:28:40,747
- Shut up.
- There was a special girl I might go see.

1163
01:28:40,915 --> 01:28:42,849
I can't believe we made it through alive.

1164
01:28:43,017 --> 01:28:45,349
- Without him, I don't think we would have.
- Yeah.

1165
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:47,715
I wasn't there but you were--
You, walking in...

1166
01:28:47,889 --> 01:28:50,119
- ...and you noticed the cliff.
- Yeah.

1167
01:28:50,291 --> 01:28:52,452
Let's go, let's go.
You're going down there.

1168
01:28:52,627 --> 01:28:54,219
Yeah.

1169
01:28:56,130 --> 01:28:57,529
I wish you could've seen him.

1170
01:28:57,699 --> 01:28:59,963
You gotta give me those tapes.

1171
01:29:04,238 --> 01:29:05,899
There is no money.

1172
01:29:11,379 --> 01:29:13,370
There never was.

1173
01:29:13,548 --> 01:29:16,449
It was the only way
to bring you all together.

1174
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:21,554
Daddy really was a changed man.

1175
01:29:22,423 --> 01:29:25,620
It was his final wish
to bring you all together.

1176
01:29:25,793 --> 01:29:27,317
That much was true.

1177
01:29:31,733 --> 01:29:34,896
There was no other way. I'm sorry.

1178
01:29:35,169 --> 01:29:36,864
You lied?

1179
01:29:38,005 --> 01:29:40,371
You never told a lie in your entire life.

1180
01:29:41,209 --> 01:29:44,770
I mean, me, I lie all the time, and Sam...

1181
01:29:45,213 --> 01:29:46,703
...he's a huge liar.

1182
01:29:46,881 --> 01:29:49,850
Then Douglas, the kid's a thief.
But you?

1183
01:29:50,585 --> 01:29:51,847
I believed you, Nina.

1184
01:29:52,019 --> 01:29:54,920
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I will go to confession.

1185
01:29:55,089 --> 01:29:59,253
Oh, yeah. "Okay, I'll go to confession.
It's all fine now." Are you kidding me?

1186
01:29:59,427 --> 01:30:02,362
- What are you gonna do about us?
- Leo, I'm sorry you're angry.

1187
01:30:02,697 --> 01:30:04,631
But the real question is...

1188
01:30:05,733 --> 01:30:09,032
...does the end justify the means?

1189
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:14,299
I mean, look at you all.

1190
01:30:22,216 --> 01:30:25,208
What about
a private investigation agency?

1191
01:30:26,220 --> 01:30:28,154
I don't follow.

1192
01:30:28,523 --> 01:30:32,755
I'm a cop. Leo, bail bondsman.
We know criminals.

1193
01:30:32,927 --> 01:30:35,555
- The kid is a criminal.
- No. Absolutely not.

1194
01:30:35,730 --> 01:30:38,324
No, I'm not bringing you together
so you can get killed.

1195
01:30:38,499 --> 01:30:40,558
Wait a second.
Are you actually suggesting...

1196
01:30:40,735 --> 01:30:42,999
...that we still go into business together
anyway?

1197
01:30:43,171 --> 01:30:46,106
If you're gonna do something,
you might as well be good at it.

1198
01:30:46,274 --> 01:30:47,298
Yeah, I like it.

1199
01:30:47,475 --> 01:30:48,601
-No.
-I'm in.

1200
01:30:48,776 --> 01:30:51,939
- That is not what Daddy wanted.
- The old man wanted us together.

1201
01:30:52,113 --> 01:30:55,640
Hope that sorry son of a bitch
is rolling over in his grave right now.

1202
01:30:56,818 --> 01:30:57,944
We got him last.

1203
01:31:09,197 --> 01:31:12,997
- Marker.
- Molly, Molly, Molly.

1204
01:31:13,835 --> 01:31:15,359
Grow up.

1205
01:31:15,670 --> 01:31:17,968
Kiss my ass, Sam.

1206
01:31:18,206 --> 01:31:20,231
- Kid.
- My bad.

1207
01:31:20,408 --> 01:31:21,773
It's all right.

1208
01:31:21,943 --> 01:31:25,504
For some reason,
he was really scary-looking that time.

1209
01:31:26,314 --> 01:31:28,714
That way,
you can read real-time stock quotes...

1210
01:31:28,883 --> 01:31:31,408
...and see how far
your company's gone in the toilet...

1211
01:31:31,586 --> 01:31:34,487
...because their leader
is about to die a horrible death.

1212
01:31:34,655 --> 01:31:37,488
Sorry, don't have my glasses on.

1213
01:31:38,059 --> 01:31:39,287
Fuck, close your eyes.

1214
01:31:40,895 --> 01:31:44,262
F-bomb. What the fudge and mustard?

1215
01:31:48,769 --> 01:31:51,101
You don't seem like brothers.

1216
01:31:51,305 --> 01:31:53,569
You ever seen Wild at Heart?

1217
01:31:55,142 --> 01:31:58,703
The two Black Hawks promised us
are both down with mechanical problems.

1218
01:32:00,715 --> 01:32:02,148
You got egg on your face.

1219
01:32:02,316 --> 01:32:04,307
- And cut it.
- I always--

1220
01:32:04,485 --> 01:32:09,218
It seems that my Rodriguez guy
is involved with that Kyle Wills--

1221
01:32:09,390 --> 01:32:12,518
- It seems that that--
- Now you have egg on your face.

1222
01:32:13,494 --> 01:32:15,826
We're gonna need some money
to get started.

1223
01:32:18,633 --> 01:32:20,533
How do you look in heels?

1224
01:32:21,536 --> 01:32:23,902
You, me, a faraway getaway place...

1225
01:32:24,071 --> 01:32:27,097
...some deli meats and a gallon of brandy.
That's fine with me.

1226
01:32:29,677 --> 01:32:31,042
Sam.

1227
01:32:31,212 --> 01:32:33,840
Oh, my God,
he can't hold a straight face over here.

1228
01:32:38,719 --> 01:32:41,552
Did wholesome Amy Smart
just say what I think she said?

1229
01:32:41,722 --> 01:32:43,917
Yeah, I did. I said, fuck.

1230
01:32:44,091 --> 01:32:45,752
And cut it.

1231

- Spit it out, woman!
- Cut. Great, cut.

1241
01:33:49,423 --> 01:33:53,621
