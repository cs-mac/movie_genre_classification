00:03:25.00,00:03:27.95
Manslaughter

00:03:28.88,00:03:33.63
On 1 7 November 1 976[br]you joined the communist party.

00:03:33.84,00:03:38.11
On 31 December 1 978[br]you helped to found the DKPML -

00:03:38.32,00:03:42.23
- and left on 3 July 1 982.[br]Why?

00:03:42.96,00:03:46.95
Why should l discuss it with you?[br]- Then there was 5 March 1 986.

00:03:47.16,00:03:52.23
Your article supporting the political[br]activities of some terrorist groups.

00:03:52.44,00:03:58.19
The organizations l mentioned[br]were not terrorist groups.

00:03:58.40,00:04:01.79
They were oppressed peoples[br]fighting for freedom.

00:04:02.00,00:04:07.51
Pil Andreasen was a pupil[br]of yours from 1 996 to 1 999.

00:04:07.72,00:04:11.55
Yes.[br]- You taught her society studies.

00:04:11.76,00:04:15.15
Was she only a pupil?[br]- What do you mean?

00:04:15.36,00:04:20.27
Did you have sex with her then?[br]- No.

00:04:21.04,00:04:24.82
When did you start?[br]- None of your business.

00:04:25.04,00:04:27.47
When did you last see her?

00:04:31.52,00:04:34.19
A week ago.

00:05:14.92,00:05:17.38
You are so bloody gorgeous.

00:05:18.24,00:05:22.07
lf history has taught us anything -

00:05:22.28,00:05:26.23
- it's that nobody[br]gives up power voluntarily.

00:05:26.44,00:05:29.39
lf you fight for a better society -

00:05:29.60,00:05:33.99
- you have to accept that people[br]will get hurt; there'll be victims.

00:05:34.20,00:05:38.11
You can't think about it[br]for too long; you have to act -

00:05:38.32,00:05:41.79
- and hope that the result[br]will be an improvement.

00:05:42.00,00:05:44.43
l agree with you.[br]lt's not that.

00:05:44.64,00:05:47.10
lt's easy just[br]to sit around saying -

00:05:47.32,00:05:50.83
- ''But what[br]if things don't improve?''

00:05:51.04,00:05:53.63
The way you do[br]now and then, right?

00:05:53.84,00:05:57.03
OK!

00:05:57.56,00:06:03.82
Acting makes me feel safe. l feel[br]more insecure if l remain passive.

00:06:04.52,00:06:11.15
When society is passive:[br]that's when l feel really scared.

00:06:15.24,00:06:17.51
l love you.

00:06:37.12,00:06:39.15
Have you got the tickets?

00:06:39.36,00:06:42.63
No, didn't you bring them?[br]- Oh, Carsten!

00:06:42.84,00:06:47.03
We can't make it home to get them.[br]- No.

00:06:48.56,00:06:52.91
For goodness' sake ...[br]- Look in the glove compartment.

00:06:53.12,00:06:55.91
There may be[br]some old ones we can use.

00:06:59.56,00:07:02.35
Very funny!

00:07:03.28,00:07:05.11
Ha, ha!

00:07:06.88,00:07:10.19
You're so horrid![br]l'll put them into my bag.

00:07:10.40,00:07:14.23
l think that's a very good idea.[br]A really good idea.

00:07:17.40,00:07:20.99
When did we tell them we'd be there?[br]- A quarter to.

00:07:22.64,00:07:27.15
As long as we make the show.[br]- Going in late is embarrassing.

00:07:31.04,00:07:35.15
We couldn't find anywhere to park.

00:07:37.76,00:07:39.55
How are you doing?[br]- Great.

00:07:39.76,00:07:40.74
Did you read the reviews?

00:07:40.96,00:07:44.63
lt had better be better than Sartre![br]- You're kidding!

00:07:44.84,00:07:48.54
That was so old-fashioned.[br]- lt was totally contempory!

00:07:48.76,00:07:50.47
You can't be serious?

00:08:13.36,00:08:16.23
Shall we just go to bed?

00:08:20.04,00:08:23.91
No, l think l'll stay up for a bit.

00:08:26.76,00:08:30.51
OK, good night.[br]Don't stay up too long!

00:09:52.24,00:09:54.43
Hi, Carsten.[br]- Hi, Poul.

00:09:54.64,00:09:57.51
Did you have a good holiday?[br]- Wonderful. Fantastic.

00:09:57.72,00:10:01.50
23 degrees by day, red wine[br]on the patio in the evening.

00:10:01.72,00:10:04.63
Come and join us next year![br]- We'll do our best.

00:10:04.84,00:10:06.79
Coming on Thursday?

00:10:07.00,00:10:09.91
Yes, Nina is off.[br]We'll be round at 8-ish.

00:10:10.12,00:10:14.19
You can see our photos.[br]- Oh, no! Not too many, then!

00:10:14.40,00:10:21.07
lf we want to put multinational[br]corporations in this table -

00:10:21.28,00:10:24.55
- has anybody any thoughts[br]as to where they belong?

00:10:24.76,00:10:28.83
lf they go into a poor country[br]and create lots of jobs, -

00:10:29.04,00:10:31.07
- injecting lots of capital, -

00:10:31.28,00:10:34.03
- and then one day[br]they decide to pull out, -

00:10:34.24,00:10:37.71
- the country will be[br]just as well off as before.

00:10:37.92,00:10:39.39
He means as badly off.

00:10:39.60,00:10:43.91
Any transnational corporation[br]will go for profits.

00:10:44.12,00:10:48.31
And those profits won't[br]go to the poor country.

00:10:48.52,00:10:52.11
Yes, l meant badly off.

00:10:52.32,00:10:56.91
So where do we want[br]to put the multinationals?

00:10:58.84,00:11:01.55
Minus? Or both sides?

00:11:03.04,00:11:04.83
You're not for real!

00:11:05.64,00:11:07.39
Find it and turn it off.

00:11:15.04,00:11:18.27
Where is it?[br]Come on, find it!

00:11:21.28,00:11:23.47
Oh, no, l'm sorry, l'm sorry!

00:11:28.64,00:11:31.71
l know, l know![br]Sorry!

00:11:31.92,00:11:33.59
Treats all round!

00:11:37.76,00:11:39.95
Sorry.[br]Carry on ...

00:11:43.00,00:11:44.83
Right then ...

00:11:45.04,00:11:47.34
Carsten, it's Pil.

00:11:47.56,00:11:49.94
Have you got a minute?

00:11:50.16,00:11:51.35
What's up?

00:11:51.56,00:11:53.75
l need 20 000.

00:11:54.28,00:11:59.11
l've got to disappear for a while.[br]lt's best you don't know why.

00:11:59.32,00:12:01.83
When do you get off?[br]- Later.

00:12:02.12,00:12:07.99
l'm at your cabin.[br]- Pil, what's going on?

00:12:08.20,00:12:13.95
Can you get me 20 000 or can't you?[br]- But why?

00:12:15.56,00:12:20.83
Because things went badly wrong[br]at Bovar last night.

00:13:11.88,00:13:15.23
Mummy, mummy,[br]there's someone at the door!

00:13:18.24,00:13:22.02
Hi. ls your mum in?

00:13:22.24,00:13:25.43
Lisbeth Norregaard?[br]- Yes?

00:13:25.64,00:13:29.18
Commander Jan Hansen,[br]Precinct 1 , Copenhagen.

00:13:29.40,00:13:32.47
Lars's colleagues;[br]may we come in for a moment?

00:13:32.68,00:13:36.75
Yes, but he hasn't come home yet.[br]Any moment now ...

00:14:00.32,00:14:03.83
The alarm's gone off at Bovar,[br]1 8, lndustry Way.

00:14:04.04,00:14:07.19
Are there any cars in the vicinity?[br]- We'll do it.

00:14:07.40,00:14:12.03
We're not far away.[br]- We'll check on Bovar, over.

00:14:50.04,00:14:51.59
Hey! Stop!

00:15:01.00,00:15:02.63
Stop! Stop!

00:15:03.92,00:15:05.83
Hands up!

00:15:06.64,00:15:10.63
So l can see them!

00:15:12.36,00:15:15.07
Get out of the van.

00:15:22.00,00:15:23.63
Lars!

00:15:55.20,00:15:57.50
He can't be.

00:15:59.52,00:16:02.15
l talked to him last night.

00:16:04.36,00:16:09.19
ls there anyone we can phone?[br]Relatives, a friend?

00:16:38.20,00:16:43.79
Hi, Lars Norregaard speaking.[br]Leave a message; l'll call back.

00:16:44.00,00:16:45.59
Have a nice day.

00:16:56.04,00:16:57.59
No!

00:17:00.56,00:17:02.15
No!

00:17:32.40,00:17:36.55
What the hell are you doing here?[br]- Where's Pil? l must talk to her.

00:17:36.76,00:17:39.87
Do you know Pil?[br]- Yes. Where is she?

00:17:40.08,00:17:42.64
What are you doing here?[br]- Where is she?

00:17:43.20,00:17:45.91
Dingo, how the hell[br]did he get in?

00:17:46.12,00:17:48.71
l don't know ...[br]What are you doing here?

00:17:48.92,00:17:51.19
lt's my house.[br]- Pil, come up here!

00:17:51.40,00:17:54.47
What is it?[br]- What's he doing here?

00:17:54.68,00:17:56.91
Can we have a word?[br]- Yes. Of course.

00:17:57.12,00:17:58.87
How did he know we were here?

00:17:59.08,00:18:01.27
lt's his house.[br]- Did you phone him?

00:18:01.48,00:18:05.95
Chill out! Chill out![br]lt's his house.

00:18:11.16,00:18:13.27
l told you not to come.

00:18:13.68,00:18:15.95
lt was on the radio.[br]He's dead.

00:18:25.08,00:18:27.07
Pil, damn it ...

00:18:29.72,00:18:32.63
Did you understand what l said?[br]- Yes.

00:18:35.20,00:18:37.43
Who was driving?

00:18:39.84,00:18:43.23
When did he die?[br]- Just now.

00:18:44.40,00:18:48.02
You weren't the driver, were you?[br]Who was?

00:18:50.44,00:18:53.35
lt will make a difference.

00:18:53.56,00:18:56.19
The driver will get 1 6 years.

00:18:56.64,00:19:01.03
The others ... you might get off[br]with 6 months for vandalism.

00:19:11.40,00:19:14.47
We're going away.[br]We're going away.

00:19:14.68,00:19:20.39
You can't do that.[br]They'll find you sooner or later.

00:19:23.36,00:19:26.98
lt's no good.[br]You only have two alternatives.

00:19:27.20,00:19:28.75
Carsten!

00:19:28.96,00:19:30.71
Yes?

00:19:30.92,00:19:33.07
l was the driver.

00:19:34.32,00:19:37.15
l was the driver, l said.

00:19:39.84,00:19:41.39
lt was me.

00:20:01.04,00:20:04.87
Where did you get to?[br]- l got held up by a car crash.

00:20:05.08,00:20:07.07
l waited half an hour.

00:20:07.28,00:20:09.07
Yes.

00:20:10.04,00:20:13.63
My mobile was dead.[br]And l thought l'd be in time.

00:20:13.84,00:20:19.31
l kept trying to phone you.[br]- l'd forgotten to recharge it.

00:20:30.48,00:20:33.55
How about a cup of tea?[br]- No, l think l ...

00:20:34.72,00:20:38.15
Good evening.[br]- Good evening.

00:20:38.36,00:20:43.03
Are you Carsten Nielsen?[br]- Yes.

00:20:43.24,00:20:48.03
We've conducted a search[br]as part of a homicide investigation.

00:20:48.24,00:20:49.79
We have a warrant.

00:20:52.88,00:20:56.55
We arrested three people[br]at your cabin this evening.

00:20:56.76,00:20:59.79
Carsten, do you know ...[br]- Please come with us.

00:21:00.00,00:21:04.35
Carsten, what's going on?[br]Carsten? What the hell ...?

00:21:14.96,00:21:20.39
Pil Andreasen was a pupil[br]of yours from 1 996 to 1 999.

00:21:21.24,00:21:24.83
Yes.[br]- You taught her society studies.

00:21:25.64,00:21:29.31
Was she only a pupil?[br]- What do you mean?

00:21:31.72,00:21:35.59
Did you have sex with her then?[br]- No.

00:21:37.12,00:21:40.63
When did you start?[br]- None of your business.

00:21:46.16,00:21:48.99
When did you last see her?

00:21:49.20,00:21:51.99
A week ago.

00:21:53.08,00:21:56.43
Do you know who the driver was?

00:21:57.12,00:21:58.95
No.

00:22:39.56,00:22:42.83
How long have you[br]been seeing her?

00:22:44.52,00:22:48.39
A year ... and a bit.

00:22:50.12,00:22:54.11
You've been seeing her for a year?

00:22:55.00,00:22:56.63
Yes.

00:22:59.16,00:23:01.75
She's an old pupil.

00:23:01.96,00:23:07.99
You've been seeing her[br]for over a year! Damn it!

00:23:08.44,00:23:12.67
l'm really sorry that[br]you had to find out like this.

00:23:12.88,00:23:15.23
l'm really sorry.

00:23:19.56,00:23:23.26
But l thought you knew in a way.

00:23:23.48,00:23:25.15
l knew?

00:23:26.72,00:23:29.35
The way we are now.

00:23:34.76,00:23:40.07
We haven't slept together[br]for over six months.

00:23:42.88,00:23:46.31
And that makes it all right[br]to fuck someone else?

00:23:46.52,00:23:49.83
No, no, it isn't. But ...

00:23:50.04,00:23:52.67
Damn it, Carsten!

00:23:58.40,00:24:02.87
lt's not her.[br]lt's us.

00:24:06.44,00:24:09.39
We are not happy together.

00:24:09.80,00:24:11.35
Are we?

00:24:13.00,00:24:15.83
We don't live any more.[br]We just move around.

00:24:16.04,00:24:20.71
We receive visitors or Tobias comes[br]and we liven up for a moment.

00:24:20.92,00:24:25.71
Our lives ...[br]there is nothing we want.

00:24:25.92,00:24:30.19
We want nothing.[br]We have nothing to fight for.

00:24:30.40,00:24:32.35
What are you saying?[br]- We ...

00:24:33.68,00:24:38.80
We'll end up like our parents.[br]Reading junk mail.

00:24:53.80,00:24:56.31
You must drop her, Carsten.

00:24:56.52,00:24:58.15
l can't do that.

00:24:58.68,00:25:00.43
And especially not now.

00:25:01.76,00:25:05.95
l'm all she's got.[br]l don't want to drop her.

00:25:19.28,00:25:24.75
l think ... l think[br]l'd better move out for a while.

00:25:26.68,00:25:29.51
To the cabin.

00:26:14.64,00:26:19.23
Three arrests have been made[br]after the death of a policeman -

00:26:19.44,00:26:23.87
- in a hit-and-run at[br]the Bovar arms factory.

00:26:24.08,00:26:27.23
The trio refuse[br]to speak about the killing.

00:26:27.44,00:26:30.91
But they admit[br]vandalizing the factory.

00:26:31.12,00:26:33.83
The police say there is no doubt -

00:26:34.04,00:26:39.06
- that one of the three ran[br]the policeman down in cold blood.

00:26:55.72,00:26:59.59
l've come to see Pil Andreasen.

00:26:59.80,00:27:02.47
Straight ahead.[br]lt's on the right.

00:27:19.96,00:27:23.47
Carsten Nielsen[br]to see Pil Andreasen.

00:27:23.68,00:27:29.19
You are not allowed to discuss[br]the case or even refer to it.

00:27:29.40,00:27:32.47
There will be[br]an officer present at all times.

00:27:32.68,00:27:38.07
lf the officer thinks you are[br]using code the visit will terminate.

00:27:51.72,00:27:55.59
You can't take the juice in.[br]We can't search liquids.

00:28:42.76,00:28:45.59
l'm allowed to hold her hand,[br]aren't l?

00:28:59.80,00:29:01.51
Thanks for coming.

00:29:02.44,00:29:03.95
Of course l came.

00:29:12.48,00:29:17.67
You may not be here for very long.[br]What does your lawyer say?

00:29:20.64,00:29:23.47
Remember not to talk[br]about the case.

00:29:33.68,00:29:35.79
Put your blouse on again, Pil.

00:29:36.44,00:29:38.27
You've been beating her.

00:29:40.16,00:29:43.78
You've beaten her up![br]- Put your blouse back on!

00:29:45.60,00:29:47.55
This visit is terminated.

00:29:48.68,00:29:50.19
Majbritt!

00:29:51.76,00:29:54.39
Right, Pil.[br]Come along.

00:29:54.60,00:29:57.11
You will have to leave now.[br]- No!

00:29:57.32,00:29:59.59
That's it for now.

00:30:00.88,00:30:04.50
Take her out.[br]- So you can beat her up again?

00:30:04.76,00:30:08.30
Stop that! Or you won't[br]be able to visit again.

00:30:08.52,00:30:13.15
Look at her![br]You haven't heard the last of this.

00:30:28.28,00:30:30.71
She had been beaten up.

00:30:30.92,00:30:34.87
l advised her not to press charges.[br]But it's up to her.

00:30:35.08,00:30:37.03
She is black and blue all over.

00:30:37.24,00:30:40.78
lt happened during the arrest.[br]Her word against theirs.

00:30:41.00,00:30:46.07
Tactically, it'd be stupid to sue.[br]- You do realize she's innocent?

00:30:46.68,00:30:48.71
That doesn't matter to me.

00:30:48.92,00:30:52.46
My client pleads not guilty.[br]That's what matters to me.

00:30:53.60,00:30:56.19
What matters[br]is whether we win or lose.

00:30:56.40,00:30:59.67
But she will be acquitted, won't she?

00:30:59.88,00:31:03.42
lf they all refuse to speak[br]there are two alternatives.

00:31:03.64,00:31:05.43
They'll all be acquitted.

00:31:05.64,00:31:09.75
Or they'll all be[br]sent down for 1 6 years.

00:31:09.96,00:31:12.55
That's what the prosecution want.

00:31:36.80,00:31:38.35
lnterview time.

00:32:04.92,00:32:07.59
Just tell me[br]who the driver was ...

00:32:11.52,00:32:13.15
l am not going to talk.

00:32:14.24,00:32:16.83
You know he had a wife, right?

00:32:20.56,00:32:22.47
And children?

00:32:26.36,00:32:32.07
This is about your life and a[br]policeman who's been killed.

00:32:34.36,00:32:37.98
And loads of other people.

00:32:38.32,00:32:41.55
But you all ignore them.

00:32:42.36,00:32:44.66
What kind of justice is that?

00:32:47.96,00:32:50.42
How about acting responsibly?[br]- l am.

00:32:50.64,00:32:53.31
So why not tell me[br]who the driver was?

00:32:55.04,00:32:56.83
Don't you ever give up?

00:34:28.68,00:34:31.35
Did you get the books?

00:34:31.56,00:34:33.15
Which books?

00:34:37.12,00:34:40.07
The ones on the list[br]we made last time.

00:34:43.56,00:34:46.59
When was last time?

00:34:47.80,00:34:49.51
On Wednesday.

00:34:51.60,00:34:53.87
l come every Wednesday, right?

00:34:59.68,00:35:02.91
You do remember the last time[br]l came, don't you?

00:35:03.12,00:35:04.63
Yes.

00:35:08.60,00:35:11.87
l keep dreaming[br]l'm banging my head on the wall -

00:35:12.08,00:35:15.86
- but there is no blood,[br]however much l bang it.

00:35:26.08,00:35:29.99
l can't take any more, Carsten.[br]l want to get out of here.

00:35:30.20,00:35:32.76
l can't take any more.[br]- Easy does it.

00:35:32.96,00:35:34.55
l don't want this.

00:35:34.76,00:35:36.87
Pil, try to calm down.[br]- l can't.

00:35:37.08,00:35:40.19
You can.[br]Just relax, all right?

00:35:40.40,00:35:43.51
Or l'll get chucked out.

00:35:45.72,00:35:47.35
Easy now ...

00:35:53.48,00:35:56.15
People think[br]this is cream puff country.

00:35:56.36,00:35:59.07
The police help ducks[br]to cross the street.

00:35:59.28,00:36:02.23
But prisoners are being[br]beaten up in our gaols.

00:36:02.44,00:36:05.98
There is no point in going to[br]the courts, a lawyer tells me.

00:36:06.20,00:36:09.15
So the dead officer's family[br]shouldn't mind?

00:36:10.28,00:36:12.07
The point is ...

00:36:13.52,00:36:16.31
... that when something[br]like this happens -

00:36:16.52,00:36:20.35
- people feel that violence[br]has suddenly entered society.

00:36:20.56,00:36:22.59
Our peaceful little society.

00:36:22.80,00:36:25.91
But our society is[br]already full of violence.

00:36:26.12,00:36:29.23
Companies like Bovar[br]make gun pods for F1 6s -

00:36:29.44,00:36:32.43
- that fly off[br]to kill thousands of people.

00:36:32.64,00:36:37.76
We sign WTO treaties that wage[br]trade wars on millions of poor.

00:36:37.96,00:36:39.75
That's also violence.

00:36:39.96,00:36:42.91
We have a dead police officer[br]on the one hand, -

00:36:43.12,00:36:46.43
- and on the other a child in lraq[br]who gets leukaemia -

00:36:46.64,00:36:49.59
- from the enriched uranium[br]in our warheads.

00:36:49.80,00:36:53.95
Two victims of the same war,[br]a war Denmark is waging.

00:36:54.16,00:36:55.79
Thank you.

00:37:03.64,00:37:08.03
l took his pyjamas out of the tumble[br]drier so l think that's the lot.

00:37:14.32,00:37:17.75
Lisbeth, l'm going now.

00:37:18.08,00:37:20.51
Come on, darling.

00:37:21.36,00:37:24.19
Have a lovely time.

00:37:25.80,00:37:28.91
Are you sure you don't want to[br]come home with us?

00:37:29.12,00:37:30.91
No, thanks, dad.

00:37:33.08,00:37:36.23
Have a lovely time.[br]- Are you sure you won't come?

00:37:36.44,00:37:39.07
Yes.[br]Phone me tonight, all right?

00:37:39.28,00:37:43.23
Phone if there is[br]anything we can do, won't you?

00:38:03.00,00:38:04.51
Hi.

00:38:06.40,00:38:08.03
Hi ...

00:38:12.12,00:38:14.39
Your mail is on the table.

00:38:18.00,00:38:23.55
The estate agent says it'll only take[br]a month or two to sell the house.

00:38:24.68,00:38:28.75
And we can ask for 50 000 more[br]if we finish the painting.

00:38:28.96,00:38:30.91
No, no, no.

00:38:31.12,00:38:33.83
l'm sorry.[br]l haven't got the energy.

00:38:40.80,00:38:42.35
Hi.

00:38:42.64,00:38:44.94
Well, well, well!

00:38:45.16,00:38:48.07
Hi, Mum![br]- Hi!

00:38:51.80,00:38:53.51
Hi! What a surprise!

00:38:57.00,00:39:00.11
Hi, dad.[br]- Hi, son.

00:39:01.16,00:39:05.55
How are things?[br]- Oh, OK.

00:39:07.24,00:39:12.31
l've brought[br]the invitations for the concert.

00:39:14.52,00:39:16.11
Here ...

00:39:16.64,00:39:19.71
Oh, yes, right.[br]- Wonderful!

00:39:22.64,00:39:25.83
l've tried phoning you[br]quite a few times, dad ...

00:39:26.04,00:39:31.83
l'm sorry. l'm not very good[br]at returning calls right now.

00:39:32.04,00:39:33.79
That's OK.

00:39:35.92,00:39:37.75
Are you still seeing her?

00:39:39.92,00:39:43.67
Her name is Pil[br]and yes, l am.

00:39:44.32,00:39:47.43
Tobias![br]- l just don't get it.

00:39:47.64,00:39:50.47
l just don't.

00:39:52.52,00:39:54.31
She's my age, damn it!

00:39:54.52,00:39:59.91
You've done lots of things in your[br]life that l'd have done differently.

00:40:00.12,00:40:03.31
But it's your life[br]and you do what's right for you.

00:40:03.52,00:40:06.59
This is my life[br]and l'm doing what's right for me.

00:40:06.80,00:40:09.91
You're 52 years old[br]and you talk like that?

00:40:10.12,00:40:13.03
You're destroying our entire family.

00:40:15.72,00:40:19.71
l ... l know you're upset.

00:40:23.00,00:40:27.07
So am l. You'd rather[br]we'd been happy together.

00:40:27.28,00:40:32.75
So would l. But we're not.[br]We have not been happy.

00:40:33.24,00:40:37.35
What do you expect us to do?[br]Stay together for your sake?

00:40:37.56,00:40:40.15
What do you mean,[br]''haven't been happy''?

00:40:40.36,00:40:44.83
l am not going to discuss it now.[br]- Why not? l hadn't heard.

00:40:45.28,00:40:50.19
No, because a merry little play[br]is always put on when you walk in.

00:40:51.56,00:40:55.67
Because we're pleased to see you[br]and we forget we're not happy.

00:40:55.88,00:41:00.39
So you hadn't seen it[br]and now you're surprised.

00:41:00.60,00:41:02.23
And l see why.

00:41:10.20,00:41:13.63
Of course all she's done[br]is to commit a murder.

00:41:13.84,00:41:16.03
And you see nothing wrong with it.

00:41:17.68,00:41:20.59
l can't do this.[br]- Tobias!

00:41:21.36,00:41:24.23
Oh, sit down![br]- Mum, l'll phone you.

00:41:24.44,00:41:27.23
Tobias![br]Don't go!

00:41:28.64,00:41:31.02
Talk to you later.

00:41:33.72,00:41:35.87
You've got two weeks.

00:41:36.08,00:41:42.31
Discuss the points in your groups.[br]Use them for a party manifesto.

00:41:44.00,00:41:45.59
Yes?

00:41:47.24,00:41:51.35
Will you pop in to see me later?[br]- Of course.

00:41:53.04,00:41:56.27
Oooh, Carsten's got[br]to see the principal!

00:41:58.64,00:42:02.83
l haven't just[br]asked you in for a chat.

00:42:03.76,00:42:07.03
There is something[br]we have got to talk about.

00:42:10.24,00:42:14.51
l'm being bombarded by parents[br]who saw you on TV.

00:42:15.68,00:42:20.83
They don't want their children[br]taught by a terrorist sympathizer.

00:42:22.12,00:42:24.42
l was going to suggest -

00:42:24.64,00:42:28.95
- that you took leave of absence.

00:42:29.40,00:42:32.15
Are you serious?[br]l'm not going on leave.

00:42:32.36,00:42:38.67
lt's important for you[br]and for the school -

00:42:38.88,00:42:44.07
- that we stop working together[br]for a while.

00:42:44.28,00:42:47.79
Poul, l'm not going on leave.

00:42:48.00,00:42:50.91
l know you have a problem.

00:42:51.12,00:42:53.31
l'm sorry about that.

00:42:53.52,00:42:57.35
You'll have to pull yourself[br]together and stand up to them.

00:42:57.56,00:42:59.91
Saying it's all right[br]for somebody to be killed ...

00:43:00.12,00:43:02.71
l didn't say that![br]- That's how it looks.

00:43:02.92,00:43:05.48
And l can't defend it.

00:43:05.68,00:43:07.59
Of course you can!

00:43:07.80,00:43:10.63
Of course you can defend[br]freedom of speech!

00:43:10.84,00:43:16.55
lt is not about freedom of speech.[br]lt's about the school's image.

00:43:16.76,00:43:20.03
That is precisely what it's about.

00:43:20.24,00:43:23.27
l say something and[br]as a result l am sent on leave.

00:43:23.48,00:43:25.23
lf that's not about[br]freedom of speech ...

00:43:25.44,00:43:29.22
lt's about the future of the school.[br]We don't want the focus -

00:43:29.44,00:43:33.11
- that this talk will[br]attract from the press.

00:43:33.32,00:43:35.07
You're meant to defend me!

00:43:35.28,00:43:37.79
And not just brown-nose[br]a few parents -

00:43:38.00,00:43:42.35
- who're upset about something[br]they haven't even heard!

00:43:42.56,00:43:46.63
There has to be a connection[br]between what you say in private -

00:43:46.84,00:43:49.63
- and what you say from that chair.

00:43:49.84,00:43:54.83
l'm not going on holiday.[br]Or leave. Forget it.

00:43:55.04,00:43:56.71
You have no choice.

00:43:57.48,00:43:59.23
You've got to.

00:44:10.20,00:44:15.19
Hi, Carsten. Pil's been[br]transferred to the hospital wing.

00:44:17.24,00:44:22.10
Hospital?[br]- She tried to cut her wrists.

00:44:26.44,00:44:30.31
But she is all right.[br]No harm done.

00:44:31.20,00:44:34.67
But ... can l see her?

00:44:41.20,00:44:45.11
Do her a favour;[br]get her to say who the driver was.

00:44:46.92,00:44:49.63
Then she'll come out of solitary.

00:44:57.72,00:45:01.19
Pil ... Pil, you mustn't do this.

00:45:17.08,00:45:21.11
l'm going to make a phone call.[br]l'll be back in a moment.

00:45:28.68,00:45:30.23
Pil ...

00:45:31.32,00:45:34.47
You're almost through it.

00:45:35.80,00:45:39.50
They can only remand you[br]in isolation for three months.

00:45:39.72,00:45:42.39
Hang in there!

00:45:43.76,00:45:46.39
lt's nearly over.

00:45:48.20,00:45:52.27
You've almost won.[br]You have.

00:45:53.72,00:45:56.07
No, Carsten, l haven't.[br]- Yes!

00:45:56.28,00:45:58.63
No, l haven't.

00:45:58.84,00:46:02.99
Why not?[br]- l killed a man.

00:46:03.20,00:46:05.07
But it was an accident.[br]- No.

00:46:08.08,00:46:10.91
lt was![br]- lt was no acident.

00:46:16.48,00:46:21.07
Carsten, l saw his wife on TV.[br]And his son.

00:46:23.16,00:46:27.15
Pil, it was an accident.

00:46:27.36,00:46:29.31
Right?

00:46:39.36,00:46:43.51
l wanted him to die.

00:46:43.72,00:46:46.75
l really wanted him to die.

00:46:49.40,00:46:52.19
l wanted to kill him.

00:47:12.84,00:47:14.51
Fuck!

00:47:18.04,00:47:22.55
lt'll grow less and less and less[br]and in the end it'll vanish.

00:47:22.76,00:47:25.06
You'll act it away.[br]- No!

00:47:25.28,00:47:28.90
Yes![br]You must stop saying that.

00:47:36.04,00:47:38.15
Pil, l love you.

00:47:38.96,00:47:43.27
You mustn't fail yourself now.[br]All right?

00:47:46.32,00:47:49.11
l told the priest.

00:47:49.44,00:47:52.59
You what?[br]- l told the priest.

00:47:54.88,00:47:57.95
Your visit is over.[br]Please say goodbye.

00:48:06.60,00:48:09.75
Pil, remember what l said.

00:48:10.64,00:48:13.75
Think it over.[br]Promise?

00:48:31.08,00:48:35.91
Are you Carsten?[br]l'm Jakob, the prison priest.

00:48:42.84,00:48:47.07
You have been talking to Pil?

00:48:47.28,00:48:51.35
Yes. As recently as last night.

00:48:59.84,00:49:02.19
ln confidence?

00:49:02.40,00:49:05.07
Yes, in confidence.

00:49:08.56,00:49:11.83
But l think you should consider ...

00:49:12.04,00:49:17.39
... leaving it to Pil to decide if[br]she can live with her guilt or not.

00:49:17.80,00:49:25.19
What happened last night shows[br]she can't live with concealment -

00:49:25.40,00:49:27.43
- and l think you are in her way.

00:49:28.44,00:49:31.15
Who the hell do you think you are?

00:49:31.36,00:49:36.22
What right have you to approach[br]somebody in deep distress -

00:49:36.44,00:49:39.27
- and tell them[br]to go to prison for 1 6 years, -

00:49:39.48,00:49:42.91
- instead of giving them[br]some sensible alternatives?

00:49:43.12,00:49:47.39
All you talk about is guilt[br]and punishment and ... vomit.

00:49:49.72,00:49:51.67
How would it help her?

00:49:51.88,00:49:55.71
How would[br]1 6 years in prison help her?

00:50:04.28,00:50:08.83
The verdict is due today[br]on the Lars Norregaard murder.

00:50:09.60,00:50:14.87
The three accused chose not[br]to testify regarding the killing.

00:51:24.00,00:51:26.46
The verdict of this court ...

00:51:26.68,00:51:32.51
Peter Jacobsen, Dennis Bak,[br]and Pil Andreasen ...

00:51:34.76,00:51:39.35
... are all acquitted of the unlawful[br]killing of Lars Norregaard -

00:51:39.56,00:51:45.63
- as the identity of the guilty party[br]cannot be established.

00:51:46.68,00:51:51.62
All three are hereby sentenced[br]to 6 months for vandalism.

00:51:51.84,00:51:56.07
As they have been on remand[br]for longer than that -

00:51:56.28,00:51:59.51
- they are free to leave.

00:52:02.32,00:52:03.91
No! No!

00:52:06.28,00:52:08.84
You can't do this![br]- Order in court!

00:52:09.04,00:52:11.75
You killed my husband![br]- Order in court!

00:52:11.96,00:52:15.63
One of them is the murderer.[br]One of you killed my husband.

00:52:15.84,00:52:20.23
The court cannot allow[br]emotional outbursts like this.

00:52:20.44,00:52:23.15
They must be convicted of murder.

00:52:33.00,00:52:36.91
l can't take it.[br]l simply can't take it.

00:52:38.32,00:52:41.11
l'm sorry.[br]l'm sorry.

00:53:21.84,00:53:25.87
lt's the one with the two windows,[br]up there on the second floor.

00:53:33.80,00:53:35.79
Fantastic, eh?[br]- lt's huge!

00:55:33.80,00:55:35.43
What do you want?

00:55:36.92,00:55:39.07
l have come to talk to Pil.

00:55:42.52,00:55:44.03
She isn't here.

00:55:46.20,00:55:48.07
Pil?[br]- Yes.

00:55:54.56,00:55:59.15
l only want to talk to her.[br]- l'm afraid she isn't here.

00:56:12.92,00:56:15.15
Will you give her this?

00:56:19.04,00:56:20.59
Yes.

00:56:25.44,00:56:27.07
Goodbye.

00:57:01.76,00:57:04.51
She won't be back.[br]Baby.

00:57:07.68,00:57:12.70
She can't talk to us.[br]She must find someone else.

00:57:13.92,00:57:17.99
Carsten, it's not going to stop.[br]Do you see?

00:57:22.60,00:57:24.19
Pil ...

00:57:27.48,00:57:30.95
Trust me: it'll stop;[br]it'll grow less; it'll disappear.

00:57:31.36,00:57:36.55
Everything will be all right again.[br]l know it doesn't seem like it.

00:57:36.76,00:57:38.39
But it will.

00:58:36.20,00:58:39.19
When do you finish?[br]- The lecture ends at 2.

00:58:39.40,00:58:43.71
Shall l pick you up?[br]- l'm seeing Peter afterwards.

00:58:43.92,00:58:48.11
But you'll be home for supper?[br]- l don't know. l'll phone.

00:58:48.68,00:58:50.19
See you!

00:59:09.88,00:59:11.39
Hi.

00:59:11.60,00:59:13.23
Hi.

00:59:15.08,00:59:16.83
Hi, Carsten.[br]- Hi.

00:59:21.64,00:59:24.23
Peter came by for a book.

00:59:24.96,00:59:27.75
Oh, did he?[br]- l'll go and find it.

00:59:34.64,00:59:36.39
Pil told me ...

00:59:38.16,00:59:41.15
... that Lisbeth[br]had been to the cabin.

00:59:43.80,00:59:45.35
Yes.

00:59:47.16,00:59:49.03
lt wasn't ... pleasant.

00:59:51.92,00:59:55.91
She's also phoned me[br]once or twice, and sent letters.

01:00:13.84,01:00:15.47
Here it is.

01:00:16.32,01:00:18.47
Thanks.

01:00:18.92,01:00:20.47
l'll phone you.

01:00:20.68,01:00:24.07
OK.[br]Take care, Carsten ... yes.

01:00:25.32,01:00:27.15
'Bye![br]- 'Bye-bye.

01:02:14.08,01:02:18.91
Pil here, l can't answer the phone[br]right now, leave a message ...

01:02:22.56,01:02:24.27
lt's me.

01:02:24.48,01:02:27.15
l can't understand[br]where you've got to.

01:02:28.48,01:02:30.23
Give me a call, all right?

01:03:06.92,01:03:10.43
Yes?[br]- lt's me. Poul.

01:03:12.04,01:03:15.11
What the hell do you want?

01:03:22.96,01:03:25.71
So this is where you're hiding.[br]- What do you want?

01:03:25.92,01:03:30.99
Just to see how you are.[br]- That's none of your business.

01:03:34.68,01:03:36.91
l want you to come back to work.

01:03:42.16,01:03:45.78
Did Nina send you?[br]- She is concerned about you.

01:03:46.00,01:03:50.83
l don't need your concern.[br]Or your help.

01:03:51.04,01:03:53.07
Tell that to Nina, too.

01:04:01.68,01:04:04.31
Hi.[br]- Hi, Pil.

01:04:05.28,01:04:08.47
Where did you get to?[br]- l fell asleep at Peter's.

01:04:14.08,01:04:15.55
Carsten ...

01:04:15.76,01:04:19.07
l hate seeing an old friend[br]cracking up like this.

01:04:19.28,01:04:21.35
l am not your friend.

01:04:21.56,01:04:25.95
Cut it out.[br]And you're not going to help me.

01:04:26.16,01:04:29.91
Sort out your own problems.[br]Stop interfering in mine.

01:04:30.12,01:04:33.66
Do something about your life first.[br]Then we'll talk.

01:04:33.88,01:04:38.82
Do something about the way your[br]wife throws herself at other men.

01:04:39.04,01:04:40.55
Do something ...

01:04:40.88,01:04:46.35
Ask yourself why you're one of the[br]bosses and what you're betraying.

01:04:47.40,01:04:50.27
You have sold out[br]all the way down the line.

01:04:50.48,01:04:52.39
Poul, you're dead.

01:04:53.36,01:04:56.59
l don't want to look at you.[br]Go away.

01:04:56.80,01:05:00.83
You're not the Carsten l once knew.[br]- Goodbye, Poul.

01:05:01.04,01:05:04.23
l've got the message.[br]- No last words. Goodbye.

01:05:04.44,01:05:06.39
Get out.

01:05:52.12,01:05:56.11
Maybe it'd be a good idea -

01:05:56.32,01:05:59.86
- to stop seeing Peter for a while.

01:06:03.32,01:06:05.55
What makes you say so?[br]- Just maybe.

01:06:05.76,01:06:12.19
Maybe it'd be a good thing[br]not to be constantly reminded.

01:06:13.24,01:06:14.99
l feel fine.

01:06:15.88,01:06:18.63
l see my friends.[br]l'm perfectly happy.

01:06:24.20,01:06:26.63
l just think it'd be a good idea.

01:06:29.96,01:06:32.67
Could you just stop[br]checking up on me?

01:06:32.88,01:06:36.23
l don't.[br]- You do!

01:06:37.80,01:06:41.63
What do you mean?[br]- You're always questioning me.

01:06:41.84,01:06:45.87
About where l've been, what[br]l've been up to, and all that crap.

01:06:46.08,01:06:50.19
l don't![br]- Your whole life is about me.

01:06:51.20,01:06:53.99
l ...[br]- What did you do yesterday?

01:06:54.96,01:06:59.47
Why should we talk about that?[br]- What have you done today?

01:06:59.68,01:07:03.51
l've been working.[br]l'm interested in how you are.

01:07:04.72,01:07:06.31
What's the problem?

01:07:06.52,01:07:11.35
The problem is this constant[br]checking up; it is driving me mad.

01:07:11.56,01:07:16.35
Do something else. See your friends.[br]- l'm only trying to help you.

01:07:16.88,01:07:18.55
Coffee?

01:07:18.76,01:07:20.43
No, thanks.

01:07:31.08,01:07:32.79
That was that, then.

01:07:33.60,01:07:35.07
Yes.

01:07:36.48,01:07:38.39
lt was.

01:07:42.40,01:07:44.67
Are you OK, Carsten?

01:07:46.08,01:07:47.63
Yes.

01:07:47.84,01:07:50.07
l've been worried about you.

01:07:50.28,01:07:52.71
l'm fine.

01:07:52.92,01:07:57.27
l have bought a flat.[br]- Oh? Where?

01:07:57.48,01:07:59.67
Just outside the centre.

01:08:00.84,01:08:03.99
Poul is also worried about you.

01:08:04.20,01:08:08.31
l don't want to talk about Poul.

01:08:08.52,01:08:10.51
l am fine.

01:08:10.72,01:08:14.15
l'm a bit pushed right now.

01:08:17.24,01:08:19.70
And l've got to go.

01:08:19.92,01:08:24.31
Not because l don't want to talk.[br]l just have to go.

01:08:26.04,01:08:28.42
See you.[br]- See you, Carsten.

01:09:11.16,01:09:12.67
l miss you.

01:09:16.68,01:09:18.47
l miss the way we used to be.

01:09:21.36,01:09:23.51
l miss talking to you.

01:09:25.36,01:09:27.43
l miss our arguments.

01:09:30.28,01:09:35.27
l want things to be[br]the way they were; not like this.

01:09:39.64,01:09:41.27
We don't need all this.

01:09:42.84,01:09:44.39
We can move on.

01:09:47.20,01:09:48.99
l miss you.

01:10:03.96,01:10:05.59
Yes?

01:10:07.36,01:10:08.91
Hello?

01:10:10.12,01:10:12.50
ls there anybody there?

01:10:14.36,01:10:16.55
Just somebody playing tricks.

01:10:17.88,01:10:20.31
Who's there?

01:10:20.52,01:10:22.23
Pil Andreasen?

01:10:28.04,01:10:29.79
Carsten?

01:10:32.96,01:10:34.87
She's downstairs.

01:10:35.08,01:10:39.15
Come downstairs and tell me[br]who killed my husband!

01:10:40.00,01:10:41.75
She is drunk.

01:10:44.28,01:10:47.51
l'll go and talk to her.[br]- Are you up there?

01:10:53.84,01:10:56.43
You can't hang around here.

01:10:56.64,01:11:00.31
Carsten, l've got to talk to Pil.[br]- You've got to go home.

01:11:00.52,01:11:05.79
Do you know who killed Lars?[br]- You can't hang around here.

01:11:06.00,01:11:08.67
l must know who killed Lars.

01:11:08.88,01:11:12.15
l can't tell you.[br]- ln that case l'll talk to Pil.

01:11:12.36,01:11:15.07
You ...[br]- l want to know what happened.

01:11:15.28,01:11:18.59
You've got to go.[br]- Who was the driver?

01:11:18.80,01:11:22.19
You must go home.[br]- You know who the driver was.

01:11:22.40,01:11:23.99
l don't know a thing.

01:11:26.52,01:11:27.99
Stop that!

01:11:28.20,01:11:30.50
l'm sorry.[br]l'm sorry.

01:11:31.36,01:11:35.14
You'll have to talk[br]to somebody else, not us.

01:11:35.36,01:11:40.51
l can't go on living without[br]knowing who killed my husband.

01:11:40.72,01:11:42.27
Go home.

01:11:42.48,01:11:47.67
l have got to find out because[br]l want to get on with my life.

01:11:47.88,01:11:51.66
What am l to tell Mikkel?[br]- Stop it!

01:11:52.96,01:11:56.35
Go home! See a psychologist![br]You can't stay here.

01:11:56.56,01:11:59.07
What am l to tell Mikkel?

01:12:01.80,01:12:04.67
What am l to tell him?

01:12:04.88,01:12:08.55
That some van or other crashed ...

01:12:08.76,01:12:11.75
... into his dad?

01:12:12.88,01:12:15.31
Some van or other?

01:12:18.48,01:12:20.99
Some van?

01:12:21.36,01:12:24.03
l can't take it any more.

01:12:37.84,01:12:40.30
She's got to learn to stay away.

01:12:43.16,01:12:48.47
You shouldn't have pushed her.[br]- l didn't. She grabbed me.

01:12:48.72,01:12:53.19
You just shouldn't have pushed her.[br]What were you thinking of?

01:12:53.40,01:12:55.91
What are you on about?[br]She grabbed me.

01:12:56.12,01:12:59.66
l didn't mean to push her.[br]- l saw you push her.

01:12:59.88,01:13:02.75
What was l meant to do?[br]- What do you think?

01:13:02.96,01:13:06.95
Yes, you tell me![br]- Talk to her, not push her.

01:13:07.16,01:13:10.11
Of course; ask her up,[br]tell her everything, -

01:13:10.32,01:13:12.31
- and go to prison for 1 6 years.

01:13:12.52,01:13:15.99
l'm talking about[br]a desperately unhappy woman -

01:13:16.20,01:13:19.31
- whom you pushed in the street.

01:13:19.52,01:13:23.91
What the hell were you thinking of?[br]- She can't just talk to me.

01:13:24.12,01:13:26.83
You didn't have to push her.

01:13:27.04,01:13:32.59
Do you think l am trying[br]to protect you for my own sake?

01:13:34.24,01:13:36.67
Oh, give me a break![br]- Give you a break?

01:13:36.88,01:13:39.71
Do you think l'm doing this[br]for my own sake?

01:13:39.92,01:13:44.11
Doing what?[br]- Getting divorced. Fired.

01:13:44.32,01:13:47.47
Losing all my friends.[br]- Don't blame me.

01:13:47.68,01:13:52.59
You made your own choices.[br]Don't try to blame them on me.

01:13:52.80,01:13:54.43
Get out![br]- Yes!

01:13:54.64,01:13:58.83
Get out![br]Get the hell out of my life!

01:14:02.00,01:14:08.39
lt was a lousy idea right from[br]the start; get out, damn you! Now!

01:16:58.32,01:17:01.19
ls there anything l can do?[br]- No.

01:17:05.92,01:17:08.35
l just need to sit here for a moment.

01:17:19.52,01:17:24.71
What can l do?[br]- l'll just sit for a moment.

01:17:28.28,01:17:29.95
lt ...

01:17:31.16,01:17:34.63
lt turned out all wrong.

01:17:35.40,01:17:37.67
l thought ...

01:17:40.08,01:17:45.31
l thought that my life would be ...

01:17:46.96,01:17:48.71
... true.

01:17:50.04,01:17:54.27
But all l did was[br]to build up a new lie.

01:18:01.92,01:18:05.43
l don't know what[br]you're trying to say.

01:18:07.56,01:18:09.07
Because ...

01:18:12.00,01:18:15.99
... they could never have proved ...

01:18:16.60,01:18:20.14
But all the time ...

01:18:20.36,01:18:23.51
... l've known.

01:18:31.20,01:18:32.99
Here you are.[br]- Thank you.

01:18:36.36,01:18:41.19
l think that[br]what l'm trying to say -

01:18:41.40,01:18:43.96
- is that l'd like you[br]back in my life.

01:18:44.16,01:18:48.19
That l made a mistake.

01:18:53.28,01:18:55.71
That it ...

01:18:56.56,01:18:59.59
... it was[br]an incredibly stupid mistake.

01:19:00.20,01:19:03.15
No, Carsten, it wasn't a mistake.

01:19:04.88,01:19:06.51
You were right.

01:19:08.04,01:19:12.43
We had got stuck in a rut.[br]l understand that now.

01:19:12.64,01:19:17.35
l'm pleased about what happened.[br]Pleased.

01:19:21.96,01:19:27.47
Carsten, l am going to New York[br]to work for a year.

01:19:29.64,01:19:32.47
l leave in three weeks.

01:19:49.84,01:19:52.43
Hello?[br]lt's me, Carsten.

01:19:53.32,01:19:56.31
- Pil?[br]She is dead.

01:19:58.32,01:20:02.43
lt's all over the front pages.[br]She killed herself.

01:20:03.68,01:20:05.23
Hey!

01:20:08.40,01:20:09.99
Are you there?

01:20:11.56,01:20:13.55
Yes.[br]- She is dead, Carsten.

01:22:11.88,01:22:13.39
Hi.

01:22:13.60,01:22:15.27
Hi?

01:22:15.48,01:22:18.55
Where did you get to?[br]- What?

01:22:18.76,01:22:21.59
Why did you stand me up?

01:22:22.04,01:22:25.19
What are you on about?[br]- Carsten!

01:22:25.40,01:22:29.07
We were going to clear the[br]last few things from the house.

01:22:29.28,01:22:32.59
l'm sorry.[br]l'll do it tomorrow.

01:22:32.80,01:22:38.19
You can't. The new owners[br]are moving in tomorrow.

01:22:39.80,01:22:44.27
l'll do it today, then.[br]All right?

01:22:46.20,01:22:47.83
Are you ill?

01:22:49.96,01:22:53.07
You look terrible.[br]ls there anything l can do?

01:22:53.28,01:22:55.79
No.[br]- OK.

01:24:19.00,01:24:24.95
Hey, look out, you're on fire![br]Carsten!

01:25:25.04,01:25:26.71
Sorry ...

01:25:28.20,01:25:29.75
Sorry.

01:25:34.88,01:25:38.63
l just came to pick up some stuff.

01:26:16.84,01:26:18.55
Pil!

01:26:49.88,01:26:51.43
Pil ...

01:26:57.08,01:26:59.51
l've ruined everything.

01:27:01.08,01:27:03.87
l'm the one who's ruined everything.

01:27:04.08,01:27:05.63
Twice.

01:27:06.80,01:27:10.39
You were right.[br]- Carsten!

01:27:10.84,01:27:15.96
After you tried to kill yourself l[br]told you to cling onto the cabin ...

01:27:16.16,01:27:18.03
lt will never stop.

01:27:19.68,01:27:23.27
lt will never stop.[br]- Yes, it will.

01:27:23.48,01:27:25.47
We'll have to act.[br]- Carsten.

01:27:25.68,01:27:32.19
l'll take you to the police.[br]- Please go, will you?

01:27:35.04,01:27:36.91
Please go.

01:27:38.12,01:27:41.66
You think you can run away from it.[br]- l am not running away.

01:27:41.88,01:27:46.90
Listen to me! Go![br]- You're not listening to me.

01:27:47.12,01:27:50.39
Go![br]- We're going together.

01:27:50.60,01:27:52.90
No.[br]- Yes ...

01:27:53.12,01:27:57.35
We've got to do this together.[br]- You are not taking me anywhere.

01:27:57.56,01:28:00.83
Yes![br]- No! You must leave now.

01:28:01.04,01:28:06.79
You're not taking me.[br]- l'll visit you.

01:28:07.00,01:28:09.75
Carsten.[br]- l'll take you to the police.

01:28:09.96,01:28:12.91
You'll never be free of it.[br]- Shall l get rid of him?

01:28:13.12,01:28:16.11
Yes.[br]- OK, Carsten.

01:28:16.32,01:28:18.47
She doesn't want to talk to you.

01:28:18.76,01:28:22.51
Stop that![br]What are you doing? Pil! Pil!

01:28:24.88,01:28:28.66
Come on.[br]- l can't stay in that flat.

01:28:30.92,01:28:33.71
Come on! Get out!

01:28:36.76,01:28:39.32
Chill out, Carsten.[br]Beat it.

01:28:39.52,01:28:43.71
She doesn't want to talk to you.

01:29:38.68,01:29:40.31
Hello.

01:29:40.52,01:29:42.87
My name's Carsten.

01:29:43.08,01:29:47.87
l'm the one who was having[br]a relationship with Pil Andreasen.

01:29:48.08,01:29:50.71
One of the three activists who ...

01:29:51.24,01:29:53.87
l know very well who you are.

01:29:58.16,01:30:04.99
l want you to know that it was Pil[br]who ... was driving that night.

01:30:16.20,01:30:19.35
How dare you?

01:30:21.60,01:30:26.75
Have you come here[br]looking for absolution?

01:30:27.08,01:30:32.91
Well, let me tell you[br]you can forget all about that.

01:30:37.24,01:30:43.15
Let me tell you something:[br]l want nothing to do with you.

01:30:43.36,01:30:47.59
Just get out of here.[br]Go away.

01:31:42.76,01:31:45.19
l'm looking for lngelise Bak.

01:31:45.40,01:31:47.59
The last door on the right.

01:32:04.24,01:32:06.51
Pil was driving the van that night.

01:32:10.96,01:32:14.11
She told me.[br]l'm prepared to testify.

01:32:16.72,01:32:18.47
lt's not enough.

01:32:18.68,01:32:23.07
lf you can get Pil to come in[br]and confess, we'll have a case.

01:32:23.28,01:32:26.35
l can't.[br]That's why l've come.

01:32:26.56,01:32:31.42
lt's not enough for the courts.[br]- lt can't be right.

01:32:31.64,01:32:34.99
We can't reopen a case[br]unless new evidence emerges -

01:32:35.20,01:32:36.87
- or someone confesses.

01:32:37.08,01:32:41.27
She confessed to me.[br]There must be some way.

01:32:41.48,01:32:46.42
You people are usually so good[br]at landing people in trouble.

01:32:46.64,01:32:51.66
Why is it impossible all of a sudden?[br]- You've brought me no evidence.

01:32:52.48,01:32:54.63
Just a story.

01:33:01.24,01:33:05.55
Do you remember?[br]Just after Pil's suicide attempt -

01:33:05.76,01:33:07.71
- you visited her.

01:33:09.08,01:33:11.23
l left the room.

01:33:12.16,01:33:15.78
You had a real chance[br]of getting Pil to confess.

01:33:17.48,01:33:19.91
But you persuaded her not to.

01:33:38.96,01:33:42.91
l just don't know[br]how to put an end to it.

01:36:23.16,01:36:25.87
