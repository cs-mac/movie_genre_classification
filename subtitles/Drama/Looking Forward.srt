1
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:17,225
This is UNSC FFG-201
"Forward Unto Dawn".

2
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:19,227
Requesting immediate evac.

3
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:20,270
Survivors aboard.

4
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,982
Prioritization code:
Victor-0-5-dash-3

5
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:27,152
dash-Sierra-0-1-1-7

6
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:33,366
Mayday. Mayday. Mayday.
UNSC FFG-201 "Forward Unto Dawn".

7
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,243
Requesting immediate evac.

8
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:38,204
Survivors aboard.

9
00:00:57,515 --> 00:01:00,310
Locked on to frequency, tracking coordinates.

10
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:05,648
Crossing now.

11
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:06,858
Play it again, please.

12
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:12,947
Mayday. Mayday. Mayday. This is
UNSC FFG-201 "Forward Unto Dawn".

13
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:15,033
Have a lock.

14
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:27,670
Shall I play it again sir?

15
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:29,422
Sir?

16
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:32,592
Commander Lasky?

17
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:42,060
Cryo-pods opening.

18
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:50,777
Lasky? You okay?

19
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:54,864
Are you alright?

20
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,285
Lasky, let's go.

21
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:05,250
Hastati Squad: 4 minutes to rendezvous point.

22
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,293
Copy Vickers. Time of 4 minutes.

23
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:09,796
Will you be able to shoot
with those hands?

24
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:11,423
We'll find out.

25
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,425
- Come on!
- Axios!

26
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,970
10 seconds. Closing in.

27
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,943
Lasky, come on, let's go!

28
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,283
We're under heavy fire!

29
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,493
Vickers, checkpoint!

30
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:42,162
Covering.

31
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:45,165
Move it.

32
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,212
Take cover. Checkpoint.

33
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:53,923
- Test, checkpoint.
- Uh, 50 seconds.

34
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,091
Go.

35
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:59,721
Silva, Sullivan, Lasky - where are you guys?

36
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,223
RV in 15 seconds.
Are you ready?

37
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:04,267
I'll see you at the party.

38
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,817
- Sully!
- We have to leave him!

39
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,694
- Lasky, what the hell!?
- Come on!

40
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:17,572
Lasky!

41
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,657
10 seconds.

42
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:25,205
- Lasky, hurry up!
- Landing in 3...2...

43
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:26,831
...1.

44
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,166
Enemy inbound.

45
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:29,417
He'll be on us in 35 seconds.

46
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:32,253
Fresh mags in your weapon,
prepare to attack.

47
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:36,007
- What?
- Our objective is to neutralize the insurrectionists

48
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,718
and acquire the target.
We move on my mark.

49
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,178
30 Seconds.

50
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,263
We should flank them and force a surrender.

51
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:45,100
We're too close to flank and
Innies never surrender.

52
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,102
It would be more like a "circle round".
There's still time.

53
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,228
We can make it.

54
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,146
25 seconds. Guys.

55
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,232
It's our best move.

56
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,567
20 seconds.

57
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:57,028
No, we're sticking to my plan, okay.
On my mark.

58
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,823
- It won't work.
- You're not in charge any more, Lasky.

59
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:02,242
- Tom just do what he says.
- 15 seconds.

60
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,244
They're my orders.

61
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,203
I don't care.

62
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:07,205
10 seconds.

63
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,249
5 seconds.

64
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:10,625
Axios!

65
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:11,918
Lasky!

66
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:42,198
Hastati Squad leader on the field.

67
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:45,243
Exercise paused.

68
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,163
Let me guess, Lasky -
you ignored orders.

69
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:52,250
It's just...
another strategic casualty, sir.

70
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,210
Unacceptable.

71
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:58,256
Game over.

72
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,759
Shoulder your weapon, cadet.

73
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:06,181
Your little escapade kept Hastati Squad
from achieving its objective...

74
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:08,224
...again.

75
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:12,520
Great job, Lasky.

76
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:24,991
Exercise complete.

77
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,120
0 wins. Hastati defaults.

78
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:32,332
Shit.

79
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:48,681
Robot tagme?

80
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:54,229
Yeah, once from two meters.

81
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:55,313
Twice from one.

82
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:58,191
I'm still numb from all those stun rounds.

83
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,777
I'm always numb.

84
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,207
Hastati!

85
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:17,252
Port ARMS!

86
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:25,218
General Black, sir!

87
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,266
Let me remind you, cadets...

88
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,269
...this academy bears the name

89
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:39,190
of the Roman general
Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo.

90
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:44,237
Because he represents honor, valor,

91
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,156
allegiance.

92
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:48,241
General Corbulo

93
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:53,246
was to take his own life
in the name of the Empire.

94
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:57,250
Corbulo did not
hesitate nor question.

95
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,211
He loyally obeyed, screaming "Axios!"...

96
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:03,256
...as he fell upon his own sword.

97
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,258
Axios:

98
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:09,262
I...am...

99
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:12,265
...worthy.

100
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:17,270
But I'm afraid, cadets, today
you have proven to be anything but.

101
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,273
We are at war with insurrectionists. Terrorists

102
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:25,195
who would like nothing
more than to see all of us dead.

103
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:28,198
Had this been a real fire fight,
the rebels would have likely killed

104
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:32,285
every member of Hastati Squad.

105
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,250
Every single one of
you at this academy

106
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:43,296
was sent here because your
parents are the upper echelon

107
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:46,257
of the United Nations Space Command.

108
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:49,135
Because all of you are its future.

109
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:52,722
And I expect you to act like it.

110
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:55,642
Understood, sir!

111
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,269
Well, what are you waiting for?

112
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:01,231
Lead them on tour, Orensky.

113
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:05,819
Axios!

114
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,237
Axios!

115
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:09,239
Hastati...

116
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,282
...right face.

117
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:15,954
Double march.

118
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:35,742
- Sully, please, enough.
- No, seriously I'm on to something here.

119
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:39,371
The comms are messed up and
I'm decoding something kick-ass.

120
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,707
- Nobody wants to hear it, Sully.
- ONI's hiding stuff from us, I'm positive.

121
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,542
They've got secrets.

122
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,836
Stop stepping on our dicks, Lasky.

123
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,421
Hey, ease up, Gingerbread.

124
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,423
No, Sully, Vickers is right.

125
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:54,219
My combat scores suck because of you.

126
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:56,429
Don't both, Junjie. He's gone soft.

127
00:09:56,513 --> 00:10:01,518
- He's an Innie lover now.
- Dimah, that order didn't make any sense.

128
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:05,522
It doesn't have to make sense.
Just follow it.

129
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:21,204
I'm trying to survive here, okay?

130
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:25,667
You need to respect the chain of command.
The UNSC isn't the enemy.

131
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,001
The Innies are.

132
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,962
Spoken like a true believer.

133
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:33,675
Yeah, well, at least I believe
in something these days.

134
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:42,559
Cadet Thomas Lasky: report to
Colonel Mehaffey's office immediately.

135
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:18,219
- No, we're sticking to my plan, okay. On my mark.
- It won't work.

136
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:21,222
- Tom, just do what he says.
- They're my orders.

137
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,223
I do not care.

138
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,225
Pause.

139
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:30,231
You don't care? You do realize
your helmets transmit everything.

140
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,274
No excuse, sir.

141
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:35,278
You continue pulling down your squad, you're
going to end up with a lot of enemies.

142
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,238
Yes, sir.

143
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:42,285
I served under your mother,
I know what she's like.

144
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:46,790
And I sure as hell don't need to tell you that
Colonel Lasky's not going to let a son of hers

145
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:49,584
leave this academy without a diploma.

146
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:53,213
I wouldn't know what mother thinks, sir.

147
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,215
I never see her.

148
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:58,259
It's been a long war.

149
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:01,262
Your mother holds a lot of hands.

150
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:04,224
So I'm told, sir.

151
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:12,273
You know, Thomas...

152
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:16,194
...I've seen a lot of cadets come through here.

153
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:20,240
Many have suffered like you.
Pain like that cannot be forgotten.

154
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,243
But you can learn how to tolerate it.

155
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:25,537
I'll do my best, sir.

156
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:27,539
That will be all.

157
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:41,261
- How long have you had the blisters?
- Been on and off for a few weeks, but...

158
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,263
...these are from yesterday.

159
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,265
Any other symptoms?

160
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:48,268
It's getting hard to breathe.

161
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:53,356
Okay, let's keep an eye on them.
Cryo-training can take its toll.

162
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:27,265
Get out of my room. What the hell, man?

163
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:33,938
Eric, get your filthy
hands off me before I belt you.

164
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,231
Hey.

165
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:38,318
I'm not a virgin.

166
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:54,125
You really shouldn't be looking
at that stuff, Sully.

167
00:13:56,211 --> 00:13:57,253
Score.

168
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:55,228
Hey, little bro. Hello from Jericho 7,
it's Day 131 of deployment.

169
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,230
Uh, so I gotta show you something.

170
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:00,608
Alright, Mom's going to flip when she sees this.

171
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,402
But, whatever.

172
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,283
It's still a little raw.

173
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:14,205
But we got a big job on an Innie stronghold next week.
Wanted to get it done before then.

174
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:18,251
- Anyways.
- So, you haven't been court-marshaled yet then?

175
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,185
I'm not apologizing.

176
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:36,227
Yes you are.

177
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:38,897
- "At least I believe in something?"
- I do believe in something.

178
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:41,149
- Yeah, so do I.
- Like what?

179
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:47,197
Just not in stupid orders that
lead to needless violence.

180
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:49,366
Negotiating isn't an option anymore, Tom.

181
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:53,787
So we're brainwashing kids and then
sending them in to exterminate a bunch of

182
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:56,081
...over-taxed farmers.
- Farmers?

183
00:15:56,081 --> 00:16:00,210
That's who you think they are?
You have no ideas what the Innies are like.

184
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:04,255
I have a pretty good idea.

185
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:10,970
Well, then you should know
how much they hate us.

186
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:14,265
And that they're not going to stop
fighting until we're all dead.

187
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:18,228
Can you blame them?

188
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:20,188
Yeah.

189
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:24,234
I can. I blame them
for a lot of things.

190
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:30,198
And you should too.

191
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:48,508
Uh, I'm staying safe.
I'm doing my job.

192
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,263
I just want to remind you to do your job.

193
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,057
Oh, and by the way.

194
00:16:56,224 --> 00:17:00,437
Nice checkmate, bro.
Yet again.

195
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:04,691
Okay, new game.
Your move.

196
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:07,277
And hang in there.

197
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:12,198
I know it's tough with Mom
being gone all the time.

198
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,868
Being alone.

199
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:17,620
She loves you. So do I.

200
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:21,124
Miss you, buddy.

201
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:28,256
I miss you too.

202
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:36,139
Lights out. Doors closing.

203
00:18:57,917 --> 00:19:00,503
We've been floating endlessly in space

204
00:19:00,503 --> 00:19:03,463
for 1,651 days

205
00:19:03,463 --> 00:19:05,757
6 hours and 19 minutes.

206
00:19:06,842 --> 00:19:09,678
Over four years aboard
this ship with nothing to do.

207
00:19:09,803 --> 00:19:11,637
No tasks to complete.

208
00:19:11,929 --> 00:19:14,724
For over four years...
all I have done...

209
00:19:15,141 --> 00:19:16,517
is think.

210
00:19:28,445 --> 00:19:31,447
For over four years...
all I have done...

211
00:19:31,989 --> 00:19:33,365
is think.

212
00:19:34,533 --> 00:19:37,328
What are you dreaming in there?

213
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,801
Come on, JJ. The robot's gonna be pissed.

214
00:19:57,511 --> 00:19:59,639
Shut up, Sully.

215
00:20:00,681 --> 00:20:02,516
I got it!

216
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:05,143
Your shirts on backwards, asshole.

217
00:20:05,435 --> 00:20:07,354
Go! Go, go, go!

218
00:20:07,354 --> 00:20:09,439
Get there quick!
Go! Keep moving!

219
00:20:09,606 --> 00:20:11,358
Are you tippy-toeing?

220
00:20:11,358 --> 00:20:13,192
Wake up, Hastati!

221
00:20:13,192 --> 00:20:15,027
Move it!
Faster!

222
00:20:15,611 --> 00:20:16,529
Wake up!

223
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:18,447
A little early for General Black,
don't you think?

224
00:20:18,489 --> 00:20:19,907
Why are you stopping?

225
00:20:19,907 --> 00:20:22,951
Are you waiting for your fancy mommy
to come and finish it for you?

226
00:20:22,951 --> 00:20:24,661
That looked like slow motion to me.

227
00:20:24,661 --> 00:20:27,664
Wake up, Hastati.
Don't like being up at 0400?

228
00:20:27,664 --> 00:20:28,873
Tomorrow it will be 0300.

229
00:20:28,873 --> 00:20:30,374
Weapons check!

230
00:20:30,374 --> 00:20:31,792
Weapons check!

231
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:32,876
Weapons check.

232
00:20:32,876 --> 00:20:34,711
Orlin, lights.

233
00:20:37,548 --> 00:20:38,674
Cadet.

234
00:20:39,382 --> 00:20:40,508
Cadet!

235
00:20:42,343 --> 00:20:44,387
You're already dead, son.

236
00:20:44,387 --> 00:20:45,805
Orlin, cadets Silva's time?

237
00:20:45,805 --> 00:20:50,308
51.07 seconds,
cadet April Orenski.

238
00:20:50,308 --> 00:20:53,103
Not good enough today, cadet Vickers.

239
00:20:54,312 --> 00:20:58,941
I believe cadet Silva's time was
just shy of the Academy record,

240
00:20:58,983 --> 00:21:01,777
held by Cadmon Lasky.

241
00:21:03,112 --> 00:21:05,239
Now that was a real soldier.

242
00:21:05,613 --> 00:21:07,699
A soldier who did not give up.

243
00:21:08,241 --> 00:21:12,954
Tomorrow, you will engage in the
last major exercise of this term.

244
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:16,790
Hastati Squad's future at this Academy

245
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:19,001
will depend on its performance.

246
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:51,779
Score.

247
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:54,574
- Where did you get this?
- Dimah.

248
00:21:55,366 --> 00:21:57,660
You could get in a lot of trouble.

249
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:00,454
Now you can't tell your
mom about this, okay?

250
00:22:02,206 --> 00:22:03,999
I won't say anything.

251
00:22:08,419 --> 00:22:10,713
Advisory: select communication systems

252
00:22:10,713 --> 00:22:12,256
will be down for system maintenance

253
00:22:12,256 --> 00:22:14,425
at 0400.

254
00:22:20,096 --> 00:22:21,890
Cadet Vickers.

255
00:22:23,099 --> 00:22:24,017
Yes, sir!

256
00:22:24,017 --> 00:22:26,352
You realize that you
and Lasky are the reason

257
00:22:26,352 --> 00:22:28,646
I had to run the tour
yesterday with you noobs.

258
00:22:28,646 --> 00:22:31,106
And why we all had to get up at 0400.

259
00:22:31,273 --> 00:22:32,650
Yes, sir.

260
00:22:33,025 --> 00:22:36,027
So, as you can imagine,
I'm pretty hungry.

261
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:39,989
And I do love this Academy's kiesh.

262
00:22:39,989 --> 00:22:41,574
Nice, April.

263
00:22:43,534 --> 00:22:44,660
Sir.

264
00:22:44,993 --> 00:22:46,828
So hand them over.

265
00:22:47,287 --> 00:22:48,705
Both of you.

266
00:23:04,302 --> 00:23:08,472
With such a renowned pedigree I sure
expected you to be a better soldier, Lasky.

267
00:23:09,265 --> 00:23:10,391
Sir.

268
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:13,394
You're dismissed.

269
00:23:16,063 --> 00:23:18,147
Must be tough on your mom...

270
00:23:18,481 --> 00:23:21,276
...knowing her real son
is never coming home.

271
00:23:24,696 --> 00:23:26,780
Oh, Lasky and Vickers!

272
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:44,796
Officer on deck!

273
00:23:54,597 --> 00:23:56,015
Outside.

274
00:24:00,644 --> 00:24:04,147
What the hell is wrong with you?

275
00:24:05,148 --> 00:24:06,065
Answer me.

276
00:24:06,065 --> 00:24:07,442
Nothing, sir.

277
00:24:09,694 --> 00:24:12,487
Well, maybe there's hope for you yet.

278
00:24:12,529 --> 00:24:13,655
Sir?

279
00:24:13,739 --> 00:24:16,366
There's a soldier inside of you,
Thomas. I can see it.

280
00:24:16,366 --> 00:24:17,993
Everyone can see it.

281
00:24:17,993 --> 00:24:19,785
You need to see it.

282
00:24:20,453 --> 00:24:22,288
I know your brother did.

283
00:24:26,667 --> 00:24:28,043
Yes, sir.

284
00:24:29,336 --> 00:24:31,463
Now go get yourself
cleaned up before class.

285
00:24:31,922 --> 00:24:33,048
Axios!

286
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:56,068
Hey, bro.

287
00:24:56,318 --> 00:24:58,153
Hello from Arcadia.

288
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:01,365
The jungles of Arcadia.

289
00:25:01,448 --> 00:25:02,366
So what can I tell ya?

290
00:25:02,366 --> 00:25:04,200
Tell him how you got your new nickname!

291
00:25:04,242 --> 00:25:05,910
- What? No.
- Jack: I'll tell him.

292
00:25:06,202 --> 00:25:08,621
Jack, come on, I got it,
I swear. I'll tell him. I'll tell him.

293
00:25:08,621 --> 00:25:11,249
Alright, you're especially gonna love this.

294
00:25:11,249 --> 00:25:14,459
So we make a drop in the rain
forest, a couple weeks ago.

295
00:25:14,459 --> 00:25:17,963
We see this river, me and the boys,
we decide to take a dip.

296
00:25:18,255 --> 00:25:21,048
Ridge warns us all not to not drink the water.

297
00:25:21,298 --> 00:25:21,882
Ridge: Yeah, I did.

298
00:25:21,882 --> 00:25:24,802
Of course, the first thing I do
is to get a mouthful.

299
00:25:24,844 --> 00:25:27,638
I almost ruin my body suit,
couple times.

300
00:25:27,847 --> 00:25:29,597
So now they call me, uh, "Volcano".

301
00:25:29,597 --> 00:25:32,058
Marines: Ha, ha! Volcano!

302
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,576
The "Pincer Movement":

303
00:25:51,576 --> 00:25:56,538
The strategy used in Earth's second
Punic War against the Roman Republic...

304
00:25:56,746 --> 00:25:58,707
...at the battle of Cannae.

305
00:25:58,707 --> 00:25:59,624
Orlin, begin.

306
00:25:59,666 --> 00:26:01,751
Lesson beginning.

307
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,587
Red represents the Romans' troops,

308
00:26:04,587 --> 00:26:06,422
blue, Hannibal's.

309
00:26:06,463 --> 00:26:09,550
Hannibal placed his spear-men
and slingers at the front.

310
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:12,511
Behind him, his swordsmen
flanked by cavalry.

311
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,554
When the Romans attacked

312
00:26:14,762 --> 00:26:16,848
Hannibal's swordsmen retreated.

313
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:21,227
To the Romans that seemed to be
due to their force but in reality

314
00:26:21,227 --> 00:26:22,936
Hannibal had ordered the retreat.

315
00:26:22,936 --> 00:26:26,857
As the Romans continued
to drive the swordsmen back

316
00:26:26,899 --> 00:26:30,152
Hannibal's cavalry galloped in from behind.

317
00:26:30,152 --> 00:26:35,948
Once the attacking pincers connected,
the Romans where completely surrounded.

318
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,326
This is an actual strategy?

319
00:26:38,868 --> 00:26:40,994
It does seem a little basic.

320
00:26:41,578 --> 00:26:45,707
The Romans outnumbered Hannibal's
troops by over 10,000 strong.

321
00:26:45,874 --> 00:26:48,250
And yet, they were defeated.

322
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:49,376
Why?

323
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:54,256
Hubris.

324
00:26:55,174 --> 00:26:58,009
Never underestimate your opponents.

325
00:26:58,885 --> 00:27:02,388
Never underestimate what
they'll sacrifice for victory.

326
00:27:04,015 --> 00:27:05,391
Questions?

327
00:27:06,183 --> 00:27:07,059
Yeah.

328
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:09,102
How do we apply this?

329
00:27:09,853 --> 00:27:12,147
Yeah, we don't have horses.

330
00:27:12,147 --> 00:27:15,191
True, we don't. But what do we have instead?

331
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:16,359
ODSTs.

332
00:27:16,984 --> 00:27:18,236
Exactly.

333
00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:20,363
They drop behind enemy lines.

334
00:27:20,696 --> 00:27:22,532
Attack from the rear.

335
00:27:22,657 --> 00:27:24,032
Neutralize.

336
00:27:26,785 --> 00:27:28,620
Or die trying.

337
00:27:33,707 --> 00:27:36,502
It's a question as old as war itself:

338
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:40,548
"If someone is trying to kill you...

339
00:27:42,257 --> 00:27:44,342
...are you not to rise against him...

340
00:27:45,593 --> 00:27:47,387
...and kill him first?"

341
00:27:51,181 --> 00:27:52,975
You were hanging on her every word.

342
00:27:52,975 --> 00:27:54,059
Why wouldn't I?

343
00:27:54,059 --> 00:27:56,311
I just hear the drum beat of endless war

344
00:27:56,311 --> 00:27:59,105
and that doesn't make me an Innie lover.

345
00:28:03,067 --> 00:28:04,902
Tell me how wrong I am.

346
00:28:07,404 --> 00:28:08,488
Look.

347
00:28:09,072 --> 00:28:11,199
You want people to change?

348
00:28:11,241 --> 00:28:13,326
You want this war to end?

349
00:28:13,493 --> 00:28:15,328
Yeah, of course.

350
00:28:15,995 --> 00:28:18,789
And you're gonna need
people to follow you.

351
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:44,187
Tomorrow, Hastati Squad will
try not to embarrass itself

352
00:28:44,228 --> 00:28:45,605
...yet again.

353
00:28:45,855 --> 00:28:47,648
You are a unit.

354
00:28:47,982 --> 00:28:50,776
Your lives are in each other's hands.

355
00:28:50,943 --> 00:28:53,737
This morning's victor,
cadet Silva, knows this

356
00:28:53,904 --> 00:28:56,740
because her parents gave
the ultimate sacrifice

357
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,825
and died on the battle field.

358
00:29:01,535 --> 00:29:04,955
Let success in tomorrow’s exercise

359
00:29:04,955 --> 00:29:06,999
be not just for our honor

360
00:29:06,999 --> 00:29:10,502
but for those who have
fallen so you can be here.

361
00:29:22,554 --> 00:29:25,432
All cadets, please be advised:

362
00:29:25,432 --> 00:29:29,602
New mandatory curfew tonight at 2100.

363
00:30:11,389 --> 00:30:14,183
Final combat exercise of this term:

364
00:30:14,725 --> 00:30:17,520
Hastati versus Zuma

365
00:30:49,715 --> 00:30:53,427
Floats, prepare for cryo-injections.

366
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:04,436
Attention!

367
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,274
Today's mission is to capture the flag.

368
00:31:09,357 --> 00:31:12,151
I expect a better outcome than last time.

369
00:31:14,069 --> 00:31:16,155
Permission to speak, sir.

370
00:31:17,323 --> 00:31:18,449
Speak.

371
00:31:18,491 --> 00:31:20,617
I'd like to take point, sir.

372
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,504
Okay, Lasky. Let's see if
you still got it in you.

373
00:31:36,632 --> 00:31:39,050
But for your sake you better hope
you can pull some magic out

374
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:42,637
of your ass or you'll be running
tour for the rest of the year.

375
00:31:42,762 --> 00:31:44,597
Understood, sir.

376
00:31:54,272 --> 00:31:55,689
Hastati Squad,

377
00:31:55,815 --> 00:31:57,650
one minute to RV point.

378
00:31:57,691 --> 00:32:00,402
On my mark...
3, 2, 1.

379
00:32:00,402 --> 00:32:01,529
Mark.

380
00:32:03,781 --> 00:32:04,906
Come on, pick it up.

381
00:32:04,948 --> 00:32:06,074
Cover.

382
00:32:06,574 --> 00:32:08,409
Move in!

383
00:32:08,701 --> 00:32:10,203
No sign of Silva!

384
00:32:10,203 --> 00:32:11,621
- Let's go!
- Move, move!

385
00:32:11,621 --> 00:32:12,831
Keep moving!

386
00:32:12,914 --> 00:32:15,707
Zuma's out here. Watch your back!

387
00:32:16,125 --> 00:32:17,501
Move in!

388
00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:20,420
At RV point.

389
00:32:20,504 --> 00:32:22,630
- I'm here.
- Arriving.

390
00:32:30,096 --> 00:32:31,471
Equal numbers.

391
00:32:35,642 --> 00:32:36,977
Deadlock to green.

392
00:32:37,185 --> 00:32:39,020
What's your plan?

393
00:32:40,688 --> 00:32:42,106
We're waiting.

394
00:33:02,166 --> 00:33:06,377
Why are we just sitting here?
If we have equal numbers we just fight it out.

395
00:33:07,587 --> 00:33:09,422
Yeah, just be patient.

396
00:33:10,631 --> 00:33:12,717
Amazing freak.

397
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,095
Okay, they're moving.

398
00:33:19,973 --> 00:33:21,057
Take off your helmets.

399
00:33:21,057 --> 00:33:22,142
What?

400
00:33:22,434 --> 00:33:24,101
That's pretty wild-card Lasky.

401
00:33:24,101 --> 00:33:25,936
We'll be flying blind.

402
00:33:26,187 --> 00:33:27,605
Trust me.

403
00:33:30,816 --> 00:33:32,901
Eyes up. Eyes up.

404
00:33:35,445 --> 00:33:37,530
We're gonna flank them.

405
00:33:49,957 --> 00:33:52,043
They're all together.

406
00:33:54,629 --> 00:33:56,422
Found 'em!

407
00:33:57,215 --> 00:33:58,632
Huh?

408
00:34:07,765 --> 00:34:08,891
Now!

409
00:34:10,226 --> 00:34:11,644
Chyler, cover!

410
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,836
Lasky?

411
00:34:47,708 --> 00:34:48,626
I hate you.

412
00:34:48,752 --> 00:34:51,088
- Cortana!
-  Stop it. I've made up my mind.

413
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:53,217
Maybe if I'm going to die aboard this ship,

414
00:34:53,217 --> 00:34:56,179
then Chief will suffer
the same fate as me.

415
00:34:56,179 --> 00:34:58,265
- Cortana stop...
-  You sacrificed everything...

416
00:34:58,265 --> 00:35:00,685
- for him.
- Control yourself.

417
00:35:00,685 --> 00:35:02,063
I can't.

418
00:35:02,731 --> 00:35:04,859
This isn't right.
Something is...

419
00:35:16,209 --> 00:35:17,878
Something set us down.

420
00:35:17,878 --> 00:35:20,507
Something. Interesting.

421
00:35:20,716 --> 00:35:22,260
I need to think.

422
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:24,346
Thinking is what's killing you.

423
00:35:48,884 --> 00:35:50,302
What happened?

424
00:35:50,468 --> 00:35:53,265
You passed out during a training exercise.

425
00:35:53,348 --> 00:35:55,435
My chest feels like it's on fire.

426
00:35:55,894 --> 00:35:58,648
Turns out the cryo blisters
and your difficulty breathing

427
00:35:58,648 --> 00:36:00,860
are an allergic reaction
to the psydoprethaline.

428
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:02,863
It's a drug we inject
to keep ice crystals

429
00:36:02,863 --> 00:36:04,616
from forming in your
cells during cryo sleep.

430
00:36:04,782 --> 00:36:07,411
Occurs in about 1 in
every 50,000 or so.

431
00:36:07,411 --> 00:36:10,917
So I won't be able to breath
every time I wake up from cryo sleep?

432
00:36:12,043 --> 00:36:15,048
The intensity of your allergy
is still undetermined.

433
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:17,468
I'll know more in a few hours.

434
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:21,307
I want you to take it real easy
the rest of the day, cadet.

435
00:36:21,933 --> 00:36:23,310
Yes, sir.

436
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:28,777
Thanks.

437
00:36:44,676 --> 00:36:46,094
Hey bro.

438
00:36:48,765 --> 00:36:51,561
I'm on Andesia, it's a jump away from home.

439
00:36:53,355 --> 00:36:55,191
It's day, uh...

440
00:36:57,945 --> 00:36:59,072
...496.

441
00:37:01,409 --> 00:37:03,537
I'm sorry I didn't com yesterday.

442
00:37:05,373 --> 00:37:09,004
Couldn't. We got pinned in a
firefight for seven hours.

443
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,975
Uhh, I must've killed
a dozen Innies though.

444
00:37:19,811 --> 00:37:21,647
Mom would be proud.

445
00:37:24,151 --> 00:37:25,820
We're doing really good work here.

446
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:28,157
We're doing a good thing.

447
00:37:33,373 --> 00:37:36,294
Rich didn't make it.
You remember Rich from back home.

448
00:37:39,883 --> 00:37:42,679
He was right there next to me and then...

449
00:37:44,097 --> 00:37:45,516
...wasn't.

450
00:37:45,642 --> 00:37:49,105
A pineapple and I'm flying
in four different directions.

451
00:37:58,035 --> 00:38:00,831
I had to shave it all off for Rich.

452
00:38:00,915 --> 00:38:03,001
He said it made me look tough.

453
00:38:05,338 --> 00:38:06,715
Anyways, uh...

454
00:38:09,427 --> 00:38:11,264
...I gotta go, bro.

455
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,309
I can't wait to get home.

456
00:38:14,309 --> 00:38:16,145
We'll see ya. Cadmon, out.

457
00:38:18,232 --> 00:38:20,318
What are you doing?

458
00:38:23,657 --> 00:38:26,495
Why do you torment yourself with these?

459
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:32,588
Are you okay?

460
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,928
- Whoa.
- I've been better.

461
00:38:37,928 --> 00:38:40,015
Wh, what did Dr. Hughes say?

462
00:38:40,098 --> 00:38:41,934
That it's nothing.

463
00:38:42,184 --> 00:38:43,312
Really?

464
00:38:51,741 --> 00:38:53,577
You know we won today.

465
00:38:54,871 --> 00:38:56,707
Your strategy worked.

466
00:38:57,958 --> 00:39:01,923
That's just me, being a leader.

467
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:06,054
Lasky, wake up.

468
00:39:06,054 --> 00:39:07,890
Oh, hey, Chyler.

469
00:39:08,265 --> 00:39:09,726
What's up, Sully?

470
00:39:09,726 --> 00:39:12,522
Get in here,
you guys gotta see this.

471
00:39:16,528 --> 00:39:17,988
You look like crap.

472
00:39:17,988 --> 00:39:20,868
Alright, so feast
your eyes on grade "A"

473
00:39:20,868 --> 00:39:24,289
classified non-licit intelligence
vids I pieced together.

474
00:39:24,332 --> 00:39:26,460
Super pain in the ass to do but...

475
00:39:26,835 --> 00:39:28,254
so worth it.

476
00:39:29,756 --> 00:39:32,051
This is beyond top secret.

477
00:39:32,051 --> 00:39:35,556
I've never seen something
encrypted so hard but I cracked it.

478
00:39:35,682 --> 00:39:37,101
Wow.

479
00:39:37,309 --> 00:39:39,396
- It's crazy, huh?
- Yeah.

480
00:39:40,314 --> 00:39:43,443
Wait, wait, wait, wait
now here comes the best part.

481
00:39:43,443 --> 00:39:46,949
-  Watch his hand.
- Target acquired.

482
00:39:47,074 --> 00:39:49,160
They're coming!
They're coming!

483
00:39:49,244 --> 00:39:51,497
That thing is like
two feet taller then we are.

484
00:39:51,497 --> 00:39:52,958
Pretty crazy, huh?

485
00:39:52,958 --> 00:39:55,044
Now check this out.

486
00:39:56,839 --> 00:40:00,093
We've got an unknown hostile.
Pulling back.

487
00:40:00,678 --> 00:40:03,515
- Uh, no way!
- Now who do you think they're running from?

488
00:40:03,515 --> 00:40:05,226
Are they fighting together?

489
00:40:05,226 --> 00:40:08,022
Okay now,
here comes the bast part.

490
00:40:09,566 --> 00:40:11,402
- Whoa.
- What is that thing?

491
00:40:11,819 --> 00:40:14,616
Now what do you think that is?

492
00:40:17,911 --> 00:40:19,998
It is now 1800.

493
00:40:19,998 --> 00:40:23,253
All cadets report to the mess hall.

494
00:40:29,429 --> 00:40:32,225
What do you think that thing was?

495
00:40:32,684 --> 00:40:34,144
Definitely not an ODST.

496
00:40:34,144 --> 00:40:35,980
Then what could it be?

497
00:40:36,315 --> 00:40:38,401
Maybe some upgraded ODST armour.

498
00:40:38,568 --> 00:40:40,738
Come on, did you not see
the size of that thing?

499
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:42,532
That's not ODST.

500
00:40:46,622 --> 00:40:48,249
Guys, look, you're missing the point.

501
00:40:48,249 --> 00:40:52,088
What matters is that our soldiers were
fighting alongside the Insurrectionists.

502
00:40:52,088 --> 00:40:54,175
Why would we protect the enemy?

503
00:40:56,804 --> 00:40:58,181
Cadet Lasky.

504
00:40:58,223 --> 00:41:01,018
Colonel Mehaffey would like to see you.

505
00:41:08,863 --> 00:41:11,659
How are you feeling?

506
00:41:11,826 --> 00:41:15,039
Uh, my chest burns, sir.

507
00:41:15,164 --> 00:41:16,583
Quite a bit.

508
00:41:18,878 --> 00:41:20,715
This is for you.

509
00:41:27,349 --> 00:41:30,187
Seems like you have a choice to make, Thomas.

510
00:41:33,608 --> 00:41:35,403
I don't understand, sir.

511
00:41:36,447 --> 00:41:40,328
It appears Dr. Hughes' test has
revealed that the level of your allergy

512
00:41:40,328 --> 00:41:43,999
to psydoprethaline is serious enough
to warrant a medical discharge.

513
00:41:44,584 --> 00:41:46,879
If you feel that you are unfit for service

514
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:50,384
all you need to do is sign the
release and bring it to the tether.

515
00:41:56,894 --> 00:41:58,229
When would I leave?

516
00:41:58,229 --> 00:41:59,647
Tomorrow.

517
00:42:01,317 --> 00:42:02,152
Tomorrow?

518
00:42:02,152 --> 00:42:03,987
You know, Thomas...

519
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:07,076
...your memories...

520
00:42:07,785 --> 00:42:10,623
...and choices are all you'll have left.

521
00:42:11,957 --> 00:42:15,463
At the end of the game the king
and the pawn go into the same box.

522
00:42:16,674 --> 00:42:20,179
You have to decide what you're
willing to sacrifice.

523
00:42:29,067 --> 00:42:30,194
Axios.

524
00:42:31,445 --> 00:42:32,572
Axios.

525
00:43:03,368 --> 00:43:04,954
Thomas.

526
00:43:04,954 --> 00:43:07,833
It is with a heavy heart that I
must inform you that today, your

527
00:43:07,875 --> 00:43:11,172
brother Cadmon was shot down by
Insurrectionist forces on Andesia.

528
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:13,425
All of his squad perished.

529
00:43:13,425 --> 00:43:16,305
I've been told that it was
a quick and painless death.

530
00:43:16,305 --> 00:43:18,600
There are no remains to bury.

531
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:22,773
With this in mind I have decided that you
shall not leave Corbulo to attend services.

532
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:38,546
Lasky!

533
00:43:39,005 --> 00:43:41,384
Lasky, move over I gotta
show you something.

534
00:43:41,384 --> 00:43:42,761
Now's not a good time, Sully, okay.

535
00:43:42,761 --> 00:43:44,597
No, it's important.

536
00:43:52,484 --> 00:43:54,612
Now what the hell is that?

537
00:43:57,241 --> 00:43:58,368
Hm?

538
00:44:00,329 --> 00:44:02,040
Whoa.

539
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,336
It's off line.

540
00:44:05,545 --> 00:44:07,631
I'm screwed, man.
It's ONI.

541
00:44:07,631 --> 00:44:09,467
They must have flagged those coms.

542
00:44:09,467 --> 00:44:11,303
I gotta talk to Dimah.

543
00:44:11,345 --> 00:44:13,432
Dimah! Did you tell your mom?

544
00:44:16,019 --> 00:44:17,146
Chyler?

545
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:38,428
Hey.

546
00:44:44,145 --> 00:44:46,231
I thought I'd give your spot a try.

547
00:44:48,067 --> 00:44:50,154
That com didn't make any sense.

548
00:44:50,905 --> 00:44:53,700
Hating the enemy is all I've ever known.

549
00:44:55,536 --> 00:44:57,623
Did you tell Mehaffey about it?

550
00:45:02,089 --> 00:45:03,215
No.

551
00:45:05,593 --> 00:45:06,720
No.

552
00:45:10,851 --> 00:45:12,270
What's that?

553
00:45:15,608 --> 00:45:17,736
Apparently I'm allergic to war.

554
00:45:23,745 --> 00:45:25,581
What does this mean?

555
00:45:25,874 --> 00:45:27,709
You're leaving?

556
00:45:29,295 --> 00:45:31,423
Yeah, tomorrow if I sign it.

557
00:45:31,758 --> 00:45:33,552
Are you going to?

558
00:45:36,265 --> 00:45:37,683
I don't know.

559
00:45:40,438 --> 00:45:43,233
- Chyler.
- Oh, it's okay.

560
00:45:44,026 --> 00:45:45,653
I know you don't want to be here.

561
00:45:45,653 --> 00:45:47,448
I just thought...

562
00:45:48,116 --> 00:45:49,242
...that maybe...

563
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:55,626
I'll miss you.

564
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:19,830
What is that?

565
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:22,584
All cadets, report to the tether.

566
00:46:22,584 --> 00:46:24,003
I don't know.

567
00:46:25,588 --> 00:46:27,884
To the tether!
Now!

568
00:46:27,926 --> 00:46:29,762
This is not a drill!

569
00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:32,766
Let's go, let's move,
let's move, come on!

570
00:46:42,364 --> 00:46:45,326
- Let's move it cadets!
- Go, go, move it cadets!

571
00:46:45,786 --> 00:46:46,912
Go, go, go!

572
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:50,376
Go to your squads. Now.

573
00:46:56,426 --> 00:46:58,263
Keep moving, cadets!

574
00:46:59,890 --> 00:47:03,395
Tyler, Lasky. The rest of the squad's
already at the tether. Let's go.

575
00:47:05,356 --> 00:47:07,944
Hastati!
This way. Hurry up.

576
00:47:08,278 --> 00:47:10,072
Right here. Right here.

577
00:47:10,072 --> 00:47:12,534
Lasky, Chen, let's go.

578
00:47:13,911 --> 00:47:15,747
Okay. Hold tight. Stay in line.

579
00:47:16,165 --> 00:47:17,709
What is this? Insurrectionists?

580
00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:19,502
I have no idea.

581
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,676
When we're assigned a number we're
going to get on to the tether, okay.

582
00:47:31,730 --> 00:47:33,148
What the...?

583
00:47:33,566 --> 00:47:35,652
Why are ODSTs dropping here?

584
00:47:36,653 --> 00:47:38,031
I don't know.

585
00:47:39,407 --> 00:47:41,493
Because we're under attack.

586
00:47:47,712 --> 00:47:48,671
This is not good.

587
00:47:48,671 --> 00:47:50,758
ODSTs dropping is never good.

588
00:47:51,635 --> 00:47:53,763
This is ridiculous.
I can get us on this wagon.

589
00:47:53,888 --> 00:47:56,558
No, no, no. We will hold our position.

590
00:47:56,558 --> 00:47:57,936
Guys, come on.

591
00:47:58,228 --> 00:48:01,023
No, Tchakova, that is a direct order.

592
00:48:01,106 --> 00:48:02,234
Suit yourself.

593
00:48:02,234 --> 00:48:03,318
- Dimah.
- No, Dimah.

594
00:48:03,318 --> 00:48:05,446
Get back in line right now.

595
00:48:08,785 --> 00:48:10,871
Return to your squad, cadet.

596
00:48:10,955 --> 00:48:11,998
I'm getting on this wagon.

597
00:48:11,998 --> 00:48:14,126
It's full. Wait for the next one.

598
00:48:14,252 --> 00:48:17,507
My mother is Secretary of Fleet-Com.

599
00:48:19,133 --> 00:48:20,928
Your choice, marine.

600
00:48:22,514 --> 00:48:23,641
Go.

601
00:48:28,106 --> 00:48:30,234
Wagon full. Send her off.

602
00:48:30,985 --> 00:48:33,614
This is taking too long, April.
Maybe we should bum-rush like Dimah.

603
00:48:33,614 --> 00:48:35,701
No. No, no, no, no, we'll be fine.

604
00:48:59,653 --> 00:49:01,781
What the hell are those things?

605
00:49:17,513 --> 00:49:18,640
Go!

606
00:50:11,511 --> 00:50:13,639
Oh my God. What is that?

607
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:25,866
Tom, come on.

608
00:50:25,907 --> 00:50:27,660
- Come on.
- What was that?

609
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:29,078
I don't know.

610
00:50:32,292 --> 00:50:34,587
Come on, come on! Run!

611
00:50:40,208 --> 00:50:43,002
I don't recognize...

612
00:50:44,671 --> 00:50:47,382
I can't...remember

613
00:50:49,842 --> 00:50:51,636
so much of myself.

614
00:50:57,141 --> 00:50:58,518
I'm lost.

615
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:04,108
I'm scared.

616
00:51:11,073 --> 00:51:14,243
Who's there? It apears to be
an alient construct.

617
00:51:14,243 --> 00:51:16,120
The data confirms it was
not built by the Covenant.

618
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:18,205
There's no need
for more anayzing.

619
00:51:18,747 --> 00:51:20,582
We are in danger.

620
00:51:32,261 --> 00:51:33,637
Come on!

621
00:51:42,438 --> 00:51:45,149
Chyler?! Hastati?!

622
00:51:47,067 --> 00:51:48,737
Get to the dorm! Go!

623
00:51:48,528 --> 00:51:51,322
- Colonel Mehaffey?
- Go, go, go, go!

624
00:52:11,843 --> 00:52:12,969
Tom!

625
00:52:13,428 --> 00:52:15,221
Come on, let's go!

626
00:52:18,266 --> 00:52:19,976
Tom, is that you?

627
00:52:19,976 --> 00:52:21,353
The dorms!

628
00:52:22,645 --> 00:52:24,481
What's happened?

629
00:52:26,191 --> 00:52:27,317
Doors are locked!

630
00:52:27,317 --> 00:52:29,402
Over here.
We might squeeze in.

631
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,377
Oh my God.

632
00:52:45,169 --> 00:52:46,337
Dimah, she's dead.

633
00:52:46,337 --> 00:52:47,838
Colonel Mehaffey.

634
00:52:47,838 --> 00:52:51,300
Yeah, and we will be too
if we don't do something.

635
00:52:52,343 --> 00:52:55,137
- Comms are offline.
- It's a whole new war.

636
00:53:02,144 --> 00:53:03,938
That sounded close.

637
00:53:14,573 --> 00:53:16,909
- It's invisible.
- What the hell's invisible?

638
00:53:16,909 --> 00:53:19,746
One of those things is
inside and it is invisible.

639
00:53:32,926 --> 00:53:33,927
We gotta get out of here.

640
00:53:33,927 --> 00:53:36,346
No, no, no, no, no.
Screw that. We stay here.

641
00:53:36,346 --> 00:53:37,180
Where we gonna go?

642
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:39,099
No, no, no. We're gonna, we're
gonna go to the training room,

643
00:53:39,099 --> 00:53:41,143
we're gonna get decked out,
we're gonna get some weapons.

644
00:53:41,143 --> 00:53:42,477
I'll take point.

645
00:53:42,477 --> 00:53:44,521
Come on. Come on, line up.

646
00:53:44,521 --> 00:53:45,897
Alright.

647
00:53:45,897 --> 00:53:48,191
Tell us when.
Tell us when, alright?

648
00:53:58,285 --> 00:53:59,411
Now!

649
00:54:05,752 --> 00:54:09,088
Go. Go, go, go, go.
Hurry. Wha...

650
00:54:12,133 --> 00:54:13,259
Guys?

651
00:54:13,801 --> 00:54:15,928
Why'd you stop, JJ?

652
00:54:18,139 --> 00:54:19,265
JJ!

653
00:54:20,767 --> 00:54:21,642
Oh my God!

654
00:54:21,642 --> 00:54:23,728
Move! Go, go, go, go!

655
00:54:27,523 --> 00:54:31,027
Lasky, send a distress beacon.
Chyler, help me get the weapons.

656
00:54:34,864 --> 00:54:36,991
- It's locked.
- My code isn't working.

657
00:54:36,991 --> 00:54:37,742
- Do it again.
- Try it now!

658
00:54:37,742 --> 00:54:39,577
Lasky, door.

659
00:54:39,911 --> 00:54:41,621
- Lasky! Door!
- Yeah! I'm, I'm trying.

660
00:54:41,621 --> 00:54:43,414
April, come on!

661
00:54:47,378 --> 00:54:48,962
Mayday. Mayday, mayday.

662
00:54:48,962 --> 00:54:52,132
This is cadet Thomas Lasky,
I repeat. Mayday, mayday!

663
00:54:52,132 --> 00:54:55,302
There's been an atack on Corbulo Academy.
Excessive casualties.

664
00:54:55,302 --> 00:54:57,429
I repeat. Excessive casualties!

665
00:54:57,638 --> 00:54:59,098
I don't have access to the live rounds.

666
00:54:59,098 --> 00:55:01,266
I, I think the beacon's down as well.

667
00:55:01,266 --> 00:55:01,809
We're dead.

668
00:55:01,809 --> 00:55:03,936
Okay, alright. Think, think.

669
00:55:03,936 --> 00:55:05,771
Think, think, think.

670
00:55:06,438 --> 00:55:07,773
We can't stay in here, April.

671
00:55:07,773 --> 00:55:09,608
We can't go out there!

672
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:20,035
Come on, Vickers. Harder!

673
00:55:20,119 --> 00:55:21,829
Harder, Vickers.

674
00:55:31,130 --> 00:55:32,257
Hide.

675
00:56:54,173 --> 00:56:55,591
Okay, go.

676
00:57:22,828 --> 00:57:24,955
Lasky, go for the door.

677
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:27,165
We can't leave Vickers.

678
00:57:33,714 --> 00:57:35,132
Where is it?

679
00:57:50,481 --> 00:57:52,316
He's right here.

680
00:58:20,887 --> 00:58:21,888
Hey!

681
00:58:21,888 --> 00:58:23,264
Guys, run!

682
00:58:24,015 --> 00:58:25,850
Vickers!

683
00:58:49,291 --> 00:58:51,168
We don't have much time.

684
00:58:51,168 --> 00:58:52,586
Let's go.

685
00:58:54,296 --> 00:58:57,675
Kelly, inform command
I have four survivors.

686
00:58:57,675 --> 00:58:59,009
Take your team north.

687
00:58:59,009 --> 00:59:02,221
Rendevouz at evac alpha
for pelican extraction.

688
00:59:02,221 --> 00:59:03,430
We'll meet you there.

689
00:59:03,430 --> 00:59:04,848
Chief out.

690
00:59:04,848 --> 00:59:06,058
How did you find us?

691
00:59:06,058 --> 00:59:07,351
A distress beacon.

692
00:59:07,351 --> 00:59:08,977
Why did he come for us?

693
00:59:08,977 --> 00:59:10,771
You're the only survivors.

694
00:59:10,771 --> 00:59:12,189
In the school?

695
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:14,316
On the planet.

696
00:59:15,526 --> 00:59:18,113
We've got 15 minutes to
get to the evac point.

697
00:59:18,113 --> 00:59:18,988
Armour up.

698
00:59:18,988 --> 00:59:21,074
It's, it's locked.

699
00:59:57,402 --> 00:59:58,820
Stay quiet.

700
00:59:58,903 --> 01:00:01,532
Do not leave. No matter
what you hear outside.

701
01:00:01,532 --> 01:00:03,617
Wait. Who are you?

702
01:00:04,535 --> 01:00:06,370
Call me "Master Chief".

703
01:00:19,967 --> 01:00:22,803
I knew those ONI
vids were bad news.

704
01:00:23,179 --> 01:00:25,264
Now we're the only ones alive.

705
01:00:25,264 --> 01:00:27,600
- Sully, shhhh.
- What the hell is going on?

706
01:00:27,767 --> 01:00:29,894
We're all following a giant robot.

707
01:00:31,937 --> 01:00:34,774
Who knows if he's even coming back?

708
01:00:37,443 --> 01:00:40,237
He's gonna come back.
I beleive him.

709
01:00:41,739 --> 01:00:43,157
You okay?

710
01:00:44,283 --> 01:00:46,119
I don't know.

711
01:00:49,790 --> 01:00:51,875
Here you go, put your helmet on.

712
01:01:00,008 --> 01:01:01,385
Hey. Hey.

713
01:01:02,678 --> 01:01:04,471
You're gonna be fine.

714
01:01:06,515 --> 01:01:07,641
Thanks.

715
01:01:26,201 --> 01:01:28,286
Who's the best shot here?

716
01:01:29,037 --> 01:01:30,456
You, probably.

717
01:01:32,917 --> 01:01:34,335
Chyler is.

718
01:01:35,545 --> 01:01:36,921
I'm good.

719
01:01:36,921 --> 01:01:38,297
I am too.

720
01:01:38,464 --> 01:01:41,300
Cadet Lasky, can you drive a warthog?

721
01:01:44,637 --> 01:01:46,055
Yeah, sure.

722
01:01:46,264 --> 01:01:47,348
Good.

723
01:01:47,473 --> 01:01:48,558
That's where we're headed.

724
01:01:48,558 --> 01:01:51,769
Shooters on the left and right.
Driver in the center.

725
01:01:51,769 --> 01:01:52,854
Stay close to me.

726
01:01:52,854 --> 01:01:54,981
It's your best chance at survival.

727
01:02:54,083 --> 01:02:55,918
Sully, keep up.

728
01:02:55,959 --> 01:02:57,878
Sully, come on.

729
01:02:57,878 --> 01:03:00,674
Wh, where,
where'd they all go?

730
01:03:10,016 --> 01:03:11,393
Get down!

731
01:03:20,026 --> 01:03:22,404
Get to the hog, I'll draw their fire.

732
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:27,033
Where'd he go?

733
01:03:27,033 --> 01:03:28,159
Chief?!

734
01:03:28,618 --> 01:03:29,994
Cover me.

735
01:03:32,747 --> 01:03:34,124
Lasky, go!

736
01:03:34,124 --> 01:03:35,500
You okay?

737
01:03:35,709 --> 01:03:37,544
I've got Sully. Go.

738
01:03:38,586 --> 01:03:40,422
Moving. Cover me!

739
01:04:22,256 --> 01:04:24,342
Chyler! I'm out. Gimme Sully.

740
01:04:25,801 --> 01:04:27,636
I got you.

741
01:04:28,721 --> 01:04:30,098
Come on!

742
01:05:08,637 --> 01:05:09,846
April, go!

743
01:05:09,846 --> 01:05:11,640
Come on, Sully.

744
01:05:30,410 --> 01:05:31,536
Go!

745
01:05:32,995 --> 01:05:34,831
Come on, Chyler!

746
01:05:36,958 --> 01:05:38,084
Drive!

747
01:05:42,208 --> 01:05:45,002
"Wake me when you need me",
he said.

748
01:06:39,761 --> 01:06:40,970
Lasky!

749
01:06:40,970 --> 01:06:43,097
It's harder than it looks!

750
01:06:43,389 --> 01:06:45,224
Hang in there, Sully.

751
01:06:45,266 --> 01:06:47,434
- Sorry
- You're doing fine, just keep it steady.

752
01:06:47,601 --> 01:06:51,105
Bear right, cadet.
There's an access directly ahead.

753
01:07:07,327 --> 01:07:11,165
Faster, cadet. 4 minutes to the Pelican.
We have to get off the planet.

754
01:07:40,150 --> 01:07:42,944
Controlled bursts.
Don't spray and pray.

755
01:07:43,904 --> 01:07:45,738
Cadet, two o'clock.

756
01:07:49,074 --> 01:07:50,451
Chyler, cover!

757
01:07:50,701 --> 01:07:52,119
Covering!

758
01:08:01,044 --> 01:08:03,671
Kelly,
track our position for evac.

759
01:08:03,671 --> 01:08:05,507
I think we're clear.

760
01:08:09,052 --> 01:08:10,886
Nice job.

761
01:08:16,725 --> 01:08:18,811
Everyone okay?

762
01:08:30,279 --> 01:08:33,115
Hand me the bio-foam
then man the gun.

763
01:08:33,574 --> 01:08:34,992
Come on.

764
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:37,577
Come on.

765
01:08:38,245 --> 01:08:40,080
God, come on.

766
01:08:42,624 --> 01:08:44,751
This will help you walk.

767
01:08:48,088 --> 01:08:49,922
We're almost there.

768
01:08:55,719 --> 01:08:56,846
Tom.

769
01:08:57,721 --> 01:08:59,139
Come on.

770
01:09:07,438 --> 01:09:08,523
Tom.

771
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:13,486
Tom.

772
01:09:14,362 --> 01:09:15,737
Chief! Chief!

773
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:18,073
Chyler's been hit!

774
01:09:21,577 --> 01:09:23,078
I'm out of bio-foam.

775
01:09:23,078 --> 01:09:25,873
We have to get her
to the Pelican now.

776
01:09:33,254 --> 01:09:34,714
They're retreating.

777
01:09:34,714 --> 01:09:36,007
Why would they do that now?

778
01:09:36,007 --> 01:09:38,050
We're being hunted.
Keep moving north.

779
01:09:38,050 --> 01:09:41,553
You'll see my team. Run as fast as you
can and don't stop for anything...

780
01:09:41,803 --> 01:09:43,221
...including me.

781
01:09:50,979 --> 01:09:53,064
- Can you walk?
- I'll try.

782
01:09:54,648 --> 01:09:56,484
Just keep breathing.

783
01:09:56,484 --> 01:09:58,569
Just hang in there, okay?
Hang in there.

784
01:10:02,364 --> 01:10:04,116
- We gotta get us somewhere.
- How about the blind?

785
01:10:04,158 --> 01:10:06,243
Yes. Let's go to the blind.

786
01:10:06,494 --> 01:10:08,286
Oh my god!

787
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,418
Guys, go!

788
01:10:22,549 --> 01:10:23,509
Sully,
you with us?

789
01:10:23,509 --> 01:10:24,927
Yeah.

790
01:10:28,347 --> 01:10:30,432
Hang in there, Chyler.

791
01:10:46,321 --> 01:10:47,781
We're going to get you
outta here, okay?

792
01:10:47,781 --> 01:10:49,908
April, stun rounds.

793
01:10:51,409 --> 01:10:53,495
This will numb the pain.

794
01:10:54,746 --> 01:10:56,832
Hang in there,
Chyler.

795
01:10:59,416 --> 01:11:02,211
Hang in there, Chyler.
Come on, hang in there.

796
01:11:27,192 --> 01:11:29,027
It's okay, Tom.

797
01:11:35,033 --> 01:11:36,451
I'm sorry.

798
01:11:58,805 --> 01:12:00,223
Chyler...

799
01:12:30,793 --> 01:12:32,211
I'm sorry.

800
01:12:35,255 --> 01:12:39,384
I need your ammo, cadets. It took
everything I had to bring that thing down.

801
01:12:39,384 --> 01:12:40,594
We don't have any.

802
01:12:40,594 --> 01:12:42,428
Just stun rounds, sir.

803
01:12:46,808 --> 01:12:47,934
Thanks.

804
01:12:51,479 --> 01:12:52,605
Guys.

805
01:12:53,022 --> 01:12:55,857
There's another one.
Move. Now.

806
01:12:59,319 --> 01:13:01,404
You have to leave her, Tom.

807
01:13:01,947 --> 01:13:03,073
Sorry.

808
01:13:08,452 --> 01:13:10,287
Lasky,
come on!

809
01:13:14,250 --> 01:13:16,377
Lasky,
come on! Come on!

810
01:14:13,179 --> 01:14:14,305
There!

811
01:14:22,062 --> 01:14:23,772
Kelly,

812
01:14:23,772 --> 01:14:27,275
negative. Need more time.
Cannot make it to the rendezvous.

813
01:14:29,402 --> 01:14:31,446
You have to hold the Pelican.

814
01:14:31,571 --> 01:14:33,072
I won't leave them!

815
01:14:33,156 --> 01:14:34,574
Chief, out.

816
01:14:36,701 --> 01:14:40,162
I'll engage. Get to the
Pelican as fast as you can.

817
01:14:53,758 --> 01:14:55,176
No, sir.

818
01:14:55,885 --> 01:14:57,178
I'll be the decoy.

819
01:14:57,178 --> 01:14:58,596
Lasky, no.

820
01:14:59,222 --> 01:15:00,306
You sweep them from behind.

821
01:15:00,306 --> 01:15:01,682
Cadet.

822
01:15:04,142 --> 01:15:05,519
Lasky?

823
01:15:06,394 --> 01:15:08,230
- Axios!
- Lasky!

824
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:10,426
Lasky!
Lasky!

825
01:17:12,094 --> 01:17:13,887
Lasky?

826
01:17:14,805 --> 01:17:16,848
Lasky? Lasky?

827
01:17:16,848 --> 01:17:18,642
Bring it down, Kelly.

828
01:17:21,978 --> 01:17:23,814
Come on.

829
01:17:50,088 --> 01:17:52,548
- We have three survivors.
- I've alerted command.

830
01:17:52,548 --> 01:17:53,924
Let's go.

831
01:19:13,039 --> 01:19:14,874
How old are all of you?

832
01:19:17,627 --> 01:19:19,462
That's classified.

833
01:19:59,207 --> 01:20:01,041
Well done, soldier.

834
01:20:29,526 --> 01:20:32,320
Shall I play it again, sir?

835
01:20:32,863 --> 01:20:33,989
No...

836
01:20:35,449 --> 01:20:37,534
...that won't be necessary.

837
01:20:42,371 --> 01:20:43,664
The captain has ordered us into

838
01:20:43,664 --> 01:20:45,458
emergency slip-space protocol.

839
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,793
Prepare for cryo.
