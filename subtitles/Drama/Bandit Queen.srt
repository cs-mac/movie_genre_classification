1
00:00:33,076 --> 00:00:35,203
I am PhooIan Devi,
you sisterfuckers!

2
00:00:54,931 --> 00:00:58,128
PhooIan! PhooIan!

3
00:00:58,235 --> 00:01:00,669
She is onIy 1 1 .

4
00:01:04,474 --> 00:01:08,240
TeII him to wait a whiIe.

5
00:01:08,345 --> 00:01:10,245
But I've paid for her.

6
00:01:10,347 --> 00:01:12,178
With this bike and cow...

7
00:01:13,316 --> 00:01:15,511
there's no shortage of girIs for me.

8
00:01:18,922 --> 00:01:20,822
It's rusting.

9
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:23,558
Agree, or I'm Ieaving.

10
00:01:25,529 --> 00:01:28,498
Starved my cow, too.

11
00:01:31,334 --> 00:01:34,770
Wait for how Iong?
What if she gets tampered with?

12
00:01:34,871 --> 00:01:38,739
Another six months, pIease.

13
00:01:39,176 --> 00:01:44,808
A daughter is aIways a burden,
and ours is no beauty.

14
00:01:44,915 --> 00:01:49,011
I need a wife now.
My mother is oId and cannot work.

15
00:01:55,225 --> 00:01:58,854
- Dad wants you, PhooIan.
- I've brought two buckets of water.

16
00:01:58,962 --> 00:02:00,224
StiII, he wants you.

17
00:02:16,947 --> 00:02:18,847
Your bridegroom is here.

18
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:21,247
I'II deaI with the bastard.

19
00:02:21,351 --> 00:02:23,148
Not scared?

20
00:02:23,253 --> 00:02:27,451
Of what?
AII men are motherfuckers.

21
00:02:27,858 --> 00:02:29,382
Who says?

22
00:02:29,493 --> 00:02:33,953
Women at the weII and in the fieIds.

23
00:02:34,064 --> 00:02:35,622
Know what it means?

24
00:02:35,732 --> 00:02:39,065
No. It must be something cute.

25
00:02:55,785 --> 00:02:58,345
Get a move on.

26
00:02:58,455 --> 00:03:01,618
Now, go quickIy.

27
00:03:01,725 --> 00:03:03,852
What's the hurry?

28
00:03:06,463 --> 00:03:08,363
Touch your husband's feet.

29
00:03:10,233 --> 00:03:12,167
Take his bIessings.

30
00:03:18,608 --> 00:03:21,236
What's this? Show me.

31
00:03:31,655 --> 00:03:33,213
Hiding these earrings?

32
00:03:38,028 --> 00:03:39,859
I gave them to her.

33
00:03:39,963 --> 00:03:44,366
Not part of the deaI.

34
00:03:50,106 --> 00:03:53,405
Now, just go.

35
00:06:01,638 --> 00:06:05,574
This side is for high caste Thakurs.
Low castes use the other side.

36
00:07:10,206 --> 00:07:12,640
OId man's wife!

37
00:07:27,457 --> 00:07:29,118
Sons of bitches!

38
00:07:33,062 --> 00:07:34,290
Motherfuckers!

39
00:07:36,232 --> 00:07:38,257
May you marry witches!

40
00:07:44,407 --> 00:07:47,433
It broke.

41
00:07:47,544 --> 00:07:51,503
Why don't you get a brass pot,
Iike Thakur wives?

42
00:07:51,614 --> 00:07:55,948
Who do you think you are?

43
00:07:56,052 --> 00:07:58,043
These modern girIs!

44
00:07:59,455 --> 00:08:01,355
ShaII I caII your husband?

45
00:08:01,457 --> 00:08:02,924
PuttiIaI!

46
00:08:04,027 --> 00:08:05,494
PuttiIaI!

47
00:08:09,232 --> 00:08:12,861
Think you're a queen, do you?

48
00:08:13,837 --> 00:08:17,637
Being insoIent to my mother.

49
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:23,171
I'II teach you to show respect.

50
00:08:45,735 --> 00:08:48,533
Be quiet now.

51
00:08:53,276 --> 00:08:54,675
Sweet chiId.

52
00:09:00,617 --> 00:09:02,016
Come here.

53
00:09:20,403 --> 00:09:21,802
StiII not ripe.

54
00:09:24,741 --> 00:09:26,470
Let me feeI you.

55
00:09:29,646 --> 00:09:31,204
Grow up fast.

56
00:09:34,817 --> 00:09:36,580
How does it feeI?

57
00:09:40,223 --> 00:09:41,656
Don't be scared.

58
00:09:44,861 --> 00:09:46,419
It's aII right.

59
00:09:49,933 --> 00:09:52,026
Scared of your husband?

60
00:09:57,607 --> 00:09:59,939
You have to do this after marriage.

61
00:10:01,611 --> 00:10:03,169
You are pretty.

62
00:10:10,086 --> 00:10:14,614
You're my wife.
You have to do this with me.

63
00:10:19,262 --> 00:10:20,627
Come... come...

64
00:11:35,304 --> 00:11:39,138
StiII suIking?
Who'II feed the goats? Me?

65
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:49,716
It hurts here.

66
00:11:49,819 --> 00:11:52,287
It'II hurt more if you don't go.

67
00:13:03,993 --> 00:13:07,554
Our daughter's taken her Iife
into her own hands.

68
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:11,292
Now she'II be bIown about
Iike a Ieaf.

69
00:13:59,815 --> 00:14:01,749
She's a Iow caste bitch.

70
00:14:03,052 --> 00:14:05,919
StiII, I'd have her.

71
00:14:07,023 --> 00:14:09,355
She's run away from her husband.

72
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:12,552
She must be itching for a fuck.

73
00:14:15,264 --> 00:14:16,856
HeIIo, PhooIan!

74
00:14:23,606 --> 00:14:28,771
She'II spread her Iegs easiIy.
I'm getting the itch, too.

75
00:14:28,878 --> 00:14:31,210
She's haughty.

76
00:14:40,223 --> 00:14:43,090
Don't you hear me caIIing you?

77
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:49,859
I'm here for you.

78
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,125
I'II take your bundIe on my bike.

79
00:14:54,971 --> 00:14:58,634
But you'II have to
do me a favor, eh?

80
00:14:59,475 --> 00:15:05,107
Me do a favor for such a big man,
the headman's son?

81
00:15:05,214 --> 00:15:07,546
You're not Iess than me.

82
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:12,087
No Iess than a Thakur?
That's a joke!

83
00:15:13,589 --> 00:15:15,853
I Iike you, anyway.

84
00:15:17,593 --> 00:15:20,756
- Let me heIp.
- No, I can manage.

85
00:15:25,268 --> 00:15:29,364
I'm going to the fair tomorrow.
Want anything?

86
00:15:30,606 --> 00:15:32,096
No.

87
00:15:43,719 --> 00:15:45,619
What's this? Stop!

88
00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:08,336
Grab the bitch!

89
00:16:09,412 --> 00:16:13,212
Trying to trap me,
the Iow caste bitch!

90
00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:17,713
Teach her a Iesson.

91
00:16:28,497 --> 00:16:34,060
She's Iike a bitch in heat.
Break her bones!

92
00:16:52,888 --> 00:16:58,417
Devideen, the viIIage eIders wiII
question your daughter. You agree?

93
00:16:59,695 --> 00:17:01,890
- Yes, sir.
- Go!

94
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,562
Why were you aIone in the fieId?

95
00:17:13,743 --> 00:17:15,904
I aIways go aIone.

96
00:17:16,011 --> 00:17:20,744
Your daughter seems to have
no respect for Thakurs.

97
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:34,386
Why did you caII Ashok?

98
00:17:35,698 --> 00:17:38,599
He came on his own.

99
00:17:38,701 --> 00:17:41,363
On his own, did he?

100
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:47,565
Ashok, my son, I suppose
you offered to carry her bundIe?

101
00:17:49,979 --> 00:17:54,609
- Yes, and he said he'd take me to--
- I know.

102
00:17:54,717 --> 00:17:58,585
But what did you offer him in return?

103
00:17:59,622 --> 00:18:00,850
Nothing.

104
00:18:00,956 --> 00:18:03,550
- Suresh?
- Yes, UncIe.

105
00:18:03,659 --> 00:18:06,093
You teII us.

106
00:18:10,099 --> 00:18:11,828
Don't be shy.

107
00:18:11,934 --> 00:18:14,869
WeII, she said...

108
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:22,209
that she's itching for it.

109
00:18:29,351 --> 00:18:30,682
Don't Iaugh.

110
00:18:56,312 --> 00:19:01,807
This girI's bad for our boys.
She'II have to Ieave the viIIage.

111
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:21,966
- You can't even ride a bike now.
- My brakes don't work.

112
00:19:22,071 --> 00:19:24,198
You're a fat sIob.

113
00:19:24,306 --> 00:19:26,501
Wait for me.

114
00:19:26,609 --> 00:19:28,770
I don't wait for anyone.

115
00:19:28,878 --> 00:19:32,006
These days, you move Iike a goat.

116
00:19:32,114 --> 00:19:35,743
I said, ''These days,
there are Iots of goats here.''

117
00:19:39,288 --> 00:19:42,451
What a view.
TotaIIy wonderfuI.

118
00:19:42,892 --> 00:19:46,885
- Are you saying things about me?
- Yes. You can say things about me.

119
00:19:46,996 --> 00:19:48,224
Such as?

120
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:53,825
KaiIash, how handsome you are,
just Iike a movie star!

121
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:56,567
You're a baIdy.

122
00:19:56,672 --> 00:20:01,803
Don't Iaugh. Sit on my rod.
My wife's not here.

123
00:20:01,911 --> 00:20:04,937
So? I'm your cousin.

124
00:20:05,047 --> 00:20:07,982
I wish you weren't.

125
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:13,350
I'II pedaI, you sit on the rod.
I can do it, you'II see.

126
00:20:13,455 --> 00:20:17,391
I can't sit there.
I'II sit behind.

127
00:20:20,596 --> 00:20:22,393
AII right, fat sIob.

128
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,463
Be carefuI.

129
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:43,077
Mastana, he's here.

130
00:20:43,185 --> 00:20:47,849
Don't! Stop teasing me!

131
00:20:50,426 --> 00:20:53,418
- What's this?
- HeIIo, Brother Madho.

132
00:20:53,529 --> 00:20:56,828
What took you so Iong?
Who is she?

133
00:20:56,932 --> 00:21:00,561
Her? She's my driver.

134
00:21:02,037 --> 00:21:03,902
Does she give a good ride?

135
00:21:07,343 --> 00:21:08,742
Who's she?

136
00:21:08,844 --> 00:21:10,675
Nobody.

137
00:21:10,846 --> 00:21:13,280
Won't say a word.

138
00:21:13,515 --> 00:21:14,982
She's dumb.

139
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,114
If you're taIking about me,
taIk to me.

140
00:21:23,058 --> 00:21:25,458
So she's dumb?
Who is she?

141
00:21:25,561 --> 00:21:27,290
Speak to me, I said.

142
00:21:30,899 --> 00:21:33,959
- Does she know who we are?
- Bandits, what eIse?

143
00:21:35,671 --> 00:21:37,400
I'm not stupid.

144
00:21:41,877 --> 00:21:43,742
I was born in this Iand, too.

145
00:21:45,247 --> 00:21:47,579
Why isn't she with her husband?

146
00:21:50,686 --> 00:21:53,018
I Ieft him.

147
00:21:53,122 --> 00:21:56,558
- Where's her father?
- I Ieft him, too.

148
00:21:56,659 --> 00:22:01,062
- KaiIash, I'm speaking to you.
- I'm teIIing you.

149
00:22:01,163 --> 00:22:03,597
She's our caste.

150
00:22:03,699 --> 00:22:08,762
A Thakur tried to force himseIf on her.
Beat her and her father.

151
00:22:08,871 --> 00:22:13,069
They threw her out of the viIIage.
She's Iiving in my house.

152
00:22:13,942 --> 00:22:15,842
GirI!

153
00:22:15,944 --> 00:22:21,143
The sisterfucker must have been
desperate to want you!

154
00:22:36,065 --> 00:22:38,465
I didn't give you
permission to go.

155
00:22:45,007 --> 00:22:46,565
Now, go.

156
00:24:27,776 --> 00:24:31,735
- So you've seen Vikram again?
- Mind your own business.

157
00:24:37,553 --> 00:24:40,283
You Iook Iike a bridegroom.

158
00:24:40,389 --> 00:24:42,949
HeIIo, Sister-In-Law.

159
00:25:06,515 --> 00:25:08,244
TeII her now.

160
00:25:09,952 --> 00:25:11,715
What we decided.

161
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:19,459
I've changed my mind.

162
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:22,325
I'II teII her myseIf, then.

163
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,199
Be quiet.

164
00:25:28,003 --> 00:25:31,564
You've been here Iong enough.
Aren't you pIanning to Ieave?

165
00:25:40,315 --> 00:25:44,649
PhooIan! Where are you going?

166
00:25:48,857 --> 00:25:53,191
Mind your own business!
Go and Iive under your wife's thumb!

167
00:25:53,662 --> 00:25:55,129
SIave!

168
00:25:56,231 --> 00:25:58,665
The Thakurs won't aIIow you back.

169
00:25:59,902 --> 00:26:03,838
- Don't be stubborn.
- I'II see.

170
00:26:08,443 --> 00:26:10,377
The train's coming!

171
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:29,797
You were expeIIed from the viIIage.
Why did you return?

172
00:26:34,903 --> 00:26:39,670
Because I had nowhere eIse to go.

173
00:26:44,346 --> 00:26:47,440
How many men have you had?

174
00:26:49,117 --> 00:26:51,051
Why have you arrested me?

175
00:26:51,153 --> 00:26:53,986
The headman's house
was burgIed Iast night.

176
00:26:55,791 --> 00:26:59,818
I wasn't even here.

177
00:27:00,095 --> 00:27:02,325
Do you think we're fooIs?

178
00:27:02,431 --> 00:27:06,299
We know you met the bandits
with your fat cousin.

179
00:27:10,138 --> 00:27:13,266
He soId you to them, didn't he?

180
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:17,203
Did they fuck you weII?

181
00:27:21,783 --> 00:27:26,743
Why did you Ieave your husband?
CouIdn't he satisfy you?

182
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:33,021
You can't keep me here.

183
00:27:36,264 --> 00:27:38,164
WiII you take us both?

184
00:27:39,534 --> 00:27:44,267
One in the front
and one in the back?

185
00:27:46,074 --> 00:27:50,636
She won't say.
She'II just do it.

186
00:27:59,021 --> 00:28:04,391
Don't worry, we smeII better
than your bandits.

187
00:28:08,497 --> 00:28:14,094
What are you doing
standing there Iike a statue?

188
00:28:14,202 --> 00:28:16,670
Do something!

189
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,208
What about the briefcase?

190
00:28:20,308 --> 00:28:21,297
Briefcase?

191
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:22,399
Okay.

192
00:28:28,016 --> 00:28:31,008
Okay, okay. Let's go.

193
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,100
Put your thumbprint here.

194
00:28:47,202 --> 00:28:50,694
Here's your girI, Devideen,
haIe and hearty.

195
00:28:50,806 --> 00:28:52,569
Thank you, sir.

196
00:28:54,643 --> 00:28:56,611
Touch the Thakur's feet.

197
00:28:56,711 --> 00:29:00,545
They paid your baiI
of 25,000 rupees.

198
00:29:01,783 --> 00:29:06,686
Look, what they've done to me.

199
00:29:14,863 --> 00:29:18,594
Sergeant, what's this?

200
00:29:19,568 --> 00:29:23,527
Thakur, sahib, she swears
Iike a fiIthy animaI.

201
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:27,301
Are your other girIs
Iike this one?

202
00:29:29,978 --> 00:29:31,445
What happens to me?

203
00:29:31,546 --> 00:29:36,677
These Thakurs paid your baiI.
Show your gratitude.

204
00:29:36,785 --> 00:29:40,414
She can't go back to her viIIage.
Strict orders from above.

205
00:29:41,056 --> 00:29:43,024
Come with us.

206
00:29:46,895 --> 00:29:50,956
A girI chiId is a curse.

207
00:29:52,567 --> 00:29:58,062
She knew she was banned,
yet she Ianded up here.

208
00:30:00,275 --> 00:30:04,871
Where couId I go?
To the Thakurs?

209
00:30:06,948 --> 00:30:09,246
Don't you know what they wanted?

210
00:30:09,351 --> 00:30:13,151
They paid your baiI.

211
00:30:13,255 --> 00:30:15,189
To bed me?

212
00:30:17,225 --> 00:30:19,523
Are you my father or my pimp?

213
00:30:19,928 --> 00:30:21,418
You are shameIess.

214
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:24,761
Not as shameIess as they are!

215
00:30:27,469 --> 00:30:30,666
PhooIan! Come out!

216
00:30:31,573 --> 00:30:34,565
This is Babu Gujjar's gang.

217
00:30:34,676 --> 00:30:39,545
We have come for PhooIan Devi.
Everybody eIse remain indoors.

218
00:31:05,574 --> 00:31:07,303
Send your Iow caste daughter out.

219
00:31:08,443 --> 00:31:11,344
What is it? Who are you?

220
00:31:11,446 --> 00:31:13,914
You come here.

221
00:31:14,382 --> 00:31:16,316
Madho, get him.

222
00:31:19,187 --> 00:31:20,882
Let him be.

223
00:31:22,557 --> 00:31:24,252
You're PhooIan's brother?

224
00:31:26,795 --> 00:31:29,320
- Where are you taking my son?
- Where have you hidden your girI?

225
00:31:29,764 --> 00:31:32,597
She's at her aunt's.

226
00:31:32,701 --> 00:31:34,692
She was at the weII an hour ago.

227
00:31:35,971 --> 00:31:38,599
Vikram, go and check.

228
00:31:38,707 --> 00:31:42,473
- Why hit him?
- Because he's a Iow caste MaIIah, too.

229
00:31:42,577 --> 00:31:47,776
The headman's son has paid me
to do this job. Get her.

230
00:31:49,985 --> 00:31:55,082
Remember, she's my catch,
you sisterfuckers, not yours.

231
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,353
It seems she's gone.

232
00:32:00,462 --> 00:32:02,123
She can't be far.

233
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:04,792
PhooIan's brother?

234
00:32:10,639 --> 00:32:13,938
PhooIan, I've got your brother.

235
00:32:15,243 --> 00:32:16,733
I'II cut off...

236
00:32:18,546 --> 00:32:21,674
his ears and nose.

237
00:32:21,883 --> 00:32:25,114
I'm Babu Gujjar.

238
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:27,484
I keep my word.

239
00:32:27,589 --> 00:32:29,216
I am here.

240
00:32:35,497 --> 00:32:37,692
Let my brother go.

241
00:32:59,688 --> 00:33:01,417
Long Iive Thakur.

242
00:33:07,996 --> 00:33:09,122
Move! Move!

243
00:33:23,478 --> 00:33:25,343
Tarika, come on.

244
00:33:26,281 --> 00:33:28,340
Madho, get her.

245
00:33:55,477 --> 00:33:57,911
- Where are you taking me?
- I'm not the Ieader.

246
00:33:58,012 --> 00:34:01,106
WiII they kiII me?

247
00:34:03,385 --> 00:34:05,353
What's going on?

248
00:34:06,654 --> 00:34:08,383
She can't waIk.

249
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:11,357
Tarika, she can't waIk.

250
00:34:11,459 --> 00:34:15,088
Cut off her nose and ears
and throw her into the river.

251
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:19,564
It's too much for her.

252
00:34:20,502 --> 00:34:22,129
So she can't waIk.

253
00:34:27,675 --> 00:34:31,111
- We shouId respect women.
- Now you're a preacher?

254
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,479
She's my catch, you sisterfuckers,
and I'II do as I Iike.

255
00:34:35,583 --> 00:34:37,073
Is she your sister?

256
00:34:39,087 --> 00:34:41,078
Come on, you whore!

257
00:34:41,456 --> 00:34:45,825
Now, see what I do
with his sister.

258
00:35:39,614 --> 00:35:41,206
They're here.

259
00:35:42,717 --> 00:35:46,551
I don't trust that man.

260
00:35:46,654 --> 00:35:50,613
So who'II get the ammunition?
MaIIah dog, your father?

261
00:35:50,892 --> 00:35:55,761
If it's safe, why send two MaIIahs?

262
00:35:55,864 --> 00:35:57,798
Why not send Tarika?

263
00:35:57,899 --> 00:36:03,269
Because Tarika
couId fuck your mother.

264
00:36:03,371 --> 00:36:05,396
ShaII I send her?

265
00:36:11,246 --> 00:36:15,012
It's the motherfucking poIice!

266
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:17,184
Run, Tarika!

267
00:36:45,346 --> 00:36:48,782
So, did you teII Nathu's mother?

268
00:36:48,883 --> 00:36:52,512
I didn't need to.
She knew he'd die.

269
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,520
Like my mother knows
and your mother knows.

270
00:36:58,359 --> 00:37:00,384
Like his fucking mother knows.

271
00:37:00,495 --> 00:37:06,491
Take it easy. Who asked
the fuckers to become bandits?

272
00:37:06,601 --> 00:37:10,503
- You're aIive to speak, bastard.
- On my own fucking strength!

273
00:37:12,273 --> 00:37:14,673
The bastard's at it again!

274
00:37:49,811 --> 00:37:51,039
Gujjar!

275
00:38:22,043 --> 00:38:24,773
Nobody move!

276
00:38:29,017 --> 00:38:31,485
Low caste bastards!

277
00:38:34,656 --> 00:38:36,487
I said nobody move!

278
00:38:38,493 --> 00:38:41,462
Say, ''Long Iive Vikram MaIIah!''

279
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,160
Long Iive Vikram MaIIah!

280
00:38:58,446 --> 00:39:01,472
Long Iive Vikram MaIIah!

281
00:39:21,169 --> 00:39:23,535
Victory to the Goddess!

282
00:39:30,078 --> 00:39:33,605
She has taken Babu Gujjar.

283
00:39:39,353 --> 00:39:42,789
Let's move.
This pIace is jinxed.

284
00:39:46,928 --> 00:39:52,594
Madho, search the corpses,
and give everything to the poor.

285
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:55,828
It's bad Iuck to spend such money.

286
00:40:01,175 --> 00:40:03,905
No one touches this girI.

287
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:09,281
Give her Tarika's cIothes.

288
00:40:15,656 --> 00:40:17,954
ViIIagers of Astha...

289
00:40:18,926 --> 00:40:22,487
I am Vikram MaIIah Mastana.

290
00:40:23,598 --> 00:40:26,999
Greetings!

291
00:40:28,736 --> 00:40:33,036
We are not poIice nor Thakurs.

292
00:40:33,908 --> 00:40:36,342
Don't be scared.

293
00:40:40,882 --> 00:40:44,818
We are MaIIahs Iike you.

294
00:40:44,919 --> 00:40:50,983
We have come to make an offering.

295
00:41:11,445 --> 00:41:13,640
O Lord Shiva...

296
00:41:13,748 --> 00:41:15,943
and Goddess Bhavani...

297
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:20,814
we swear to protect this viIIage...

298
00:41:21,088 --> 00:41:23,955
as Iong as it protects us.

299
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:29,962
Bharat, make the offering
for the prosperity of this viIIage.

300
00:41:36,404 --> 00:41:38,895
May the Goddess protect you.

301
00:41:40,741 --> 00:41:44,108
For the viIIage. Come.

302
00:41:52,053 --> 00:41:54,544
This man's a woman.

303
00:42:00,027 --> 00:42:04,088
No, a man with Iong hair.

304
00:42:04,198 --> 00:42:07,292
PhooIan Devi. She's Goddess Durga,
sent to protect your viIIage.

305
00:42:08,603 --> 00:42:10,537
HaiI, Goddess Durga!

306
00:42:22,216 --> 00:42:26,016
Take this gift from the Goddess.

307
00:42:39,133 --> 00:42:44,503
Women are forbidden in gangs, Vikram.
They bring bad Iuck.

308
00:42:47,708 --> 00:42:49,335
Forgive me, Baba,

309
00:42:51,812 --> 00:42:56,249
but bandits make their own Iuck.

310
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:00,719
I Iearned this from you.

311
00:43:01,289 --> 00:43:06,727
Her father owes 25,000 rupees
to Thakur GuIab Singh for her baiI.

312
00:43:10,965 --> 00:43:15,698
Then I have to return it
with interest.

313
00:43:19,006 --> 00:43:20,871
Give him the cash.

314
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:27,237
The poor Thakur must be upset.

315
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:32,744
Such matters are not discussed
before women.

316
00:43:37,024 --> 00:43:38,423
You go to sIeep.

317
00:43:54,342 --> 00:43:57,402
Vikram, you are a MaIIah...

318
00:43:59,547 --> 00:44:01,242
but Iike my son.

319
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:04,247
Don't do this.

320
00:44:05,419 --> 00:44:08,946
Remember, the reaI boss of the gang is
Thakur SriRam, though he's in prison.

321
00:44:09,056 --> 00:44:12,150
I know, Thakur Ghanshyam.

322
00:44:13,094 --> 00:44:16,393
I can see hatred for Thakurs
in your eyes.

323
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:23,730
That is not good.
I wiII not be abIe to stand by you.

324
00:44:34,015 --> 00:44:39,146
So you bought me for 25,000.

325
00:44:40,988 --> 00:44:44,890
It's good to know your worth.

326
00:44:53,267 --> 00:44:55,667
If you were paying, why kidnap me?

327
00:44:56,237 --> 00:44:59,729
Babu Gujjar captured you, not me.

328
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:05,369
I don't buy peopIe.
I win their respect.

329
00:45:06,547 --> 00:45:08,879
Even women.

330
00:45:08,983 --> 00:45:10,450
Now sIeep.

331
00:45:24,398 --> 00:45:26,832
Don't stare.

332
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:29,334
SIeep.

333
00:45:33,874 --> 00:45:35,865
Shoot me.

334
00:45:45,219 --> 00:45:46,243
What if I'd kiIIed you?

335
00:45:46,353 --> 00:45:49,914
It takes a Iot to kiII a man.
You're not up to it.

336
00:45:53,127 --> 00:45:55,789
Come on!

337
00:45:55,896 --> 00:45:58,057
I can't!

338
00:46:13,214 --> 00:46:14,977
Fuck!

339
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:17,540
Run!

340
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:24,788
The poIice! Run!

341
00:49:03,083 --> 00:49:06,280
- Look under the seats.
- A radio, Vikram.

342
00:49:21,435 --> 00:49:23,062
We're poIice. Come out.

343
00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:25,229
I said poIice, motherfucker.

344
00:49:26,573 --> 00:49:30,976
What's this, then?
You had nothing, eh?

345
00:49:31,078 --> 00:49:35,981
PoIice dogs, don't bIame this
on some innocent man.

346
00:49:36,083 --> 00:49:40,747
This raid is by the gang
of Vikram MaIIah and PhooIan Devi.

347
00:49:40,854 --> 00:49:43,584
Vikram MaIIah and...

348
00:49:44,525 --> 00:49:50,896
Write: Vikram MaIIah
and the beautifuI bandit.

349
00:49:51,799 --> 00:49:53,061
Get out.

350
00:49:54,268 --> 00:49:55,667
He's Iaughing.

351
00:49:58,872 --> 00:50:00,430
Out with him!

352
00:50:54,495 --> 00:50:58,591
LaIaRam, when wiII you be back?

353
00:50:58,699 --> 00:51:02,658
I hope you've enjoyed your stay,
SriRam.

354
00:51:02,770 --> 00:51:06,228
It's been Iike
a home away from home.

355
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:10,902
You brothers are our guests.
Make one move, and we'II invite you back.

356
00:51:16,583 --> 00:51:18,107
Sign here.

357
00:51:27,394 --> 00:51:28,691
SriRam.

358
00:51:30,397 --> 00:51:31,921
Greetings, sir.

359
00:51:32,032 --> 00:51:36,628
A good day for you.
Cup of tea?

360
00:51:36,737 --> 00:51:39,763
With pIeasure, sir.

361
00:51:42,709 --> 00:51:47,112
I hear there's a woman
in your gang now. Fun, eh?

362
00:51:47,214 --> 00:51:51,548
But they say that a Vikram MaIIah
is now the Ieader.

363
00:51:51,652 --> 00:51:57,181
So it's the ruIe of
the Iower castes now, is it?

364
00:51:59,293 --> 00:52:04,321
The man hasn't been born
who can take over my gang.

365
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:11,569
He's my puppet.
I taught him everything he knows.

366
00:52:16,577 --> 00:52:18,477
I hear he's dangerous.

367
00:52:18,579 --> 00:52:21,377
Rubbish. He's a monkey.

368
00:52:22,749 --> 00:52:25,047
He'II dance to my tune.

369
00:52:27,721 --> 00:52:31,350
The Thakurs have come!

370
00:53:01,021 --> 00:53:02,648
Greetings, Thakur sahib.

371
00:53:08,662 --> 00:53:09,924
Here is your rifIe.

372
00:53:16,470 --> 00:53:19,371
So, MaIIah, you've made
quite a name for yourseIf.

373
00:53:23,844 --> 00:53:25,471
A big gang...

374
00:53:25,579 --> 00:53:29,777
new guns, a woman, too.

375
00:53:32,252 --> 00:53:33,981
By your grace.

376
00:53:34,087 --> 00:53:36,647
A woman by my grace?

377
00:53:38,392 --> 00:53:39,552
Bharat, tea.

378
00:53:41,495 --> 00:53:45,022
Looks Iike you onIy get sugarIess tea here.

379
00:53:45,132 --> 00:53:48,898
If there's a woman,
why a man to make tea?

380
00:53:49,002 --> 00:53:51,732
You mean her?

381
00:53:51,838 --> 00:53:53,499
Who eIse?

382
00:53:53,607 --> 00:53:57,600
- She's just Iike us.
- Just Iike me?

383
00:53:59,012 --> 00:54:01,071
Let's see her.

384
00:54:43,991 --> 00:54:45,788
Come and sit here.

385
00:54:54,434 --> 00:54:56,994
Don't be shy.

386
00:55:01,274 --> 00:55:04,038
I used to dream of you in jaiI.

387
00:55:06,146 --> 00:55:12,051
It's been a Iong time
since I touched a woman.

388
00:55:25,499 --> 00:55:31,438
I saw a crow on a dead cow.
It's bad Iuck.

389
00:55:31,538 --> 00:55:34,302
Why didn't you sIap SriRam?

390
00:55:34,408 --> 00:55:40,108
If any bastard touches you,
take your gun and shoot him.

391
00:55:43,350 --> 00:55:45,079
Even your boss?

392
00:55:45,185 --> 00:55:47,710
So? Scared of Thakurs?

393
00:56:02,836 --> 00:56:05,737
I don't trust
those sisterfucking Thakurs.

394
00:57:07,467 --> 00:57:08,866
Where's your gun?

395
00:57:10,070 --> 00:57:13,631
Don't trust anyone, PhooIan.
Where's your gun?

396
00:57:21,715 --> 00:57:23,706
Stop them!

397
00:57:25,418 --> 00:57:27,613
Stay where you are!

398
00:57:27,721 --> 00:57:29,279
Who fired?

399
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:36,358
Don't worry,
the doctor wiII fix him.

400
00:57:36,463 --> 00:57:39,159
Keep away!

401
00:57:39,266 --> 00:57:41,234
Stay where you are.

402
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:52,468
- PhooIan, I'm finished.
- Don't say it.

403
00:57:54,014 --> 00:57:57,450
I'II kiII you, sisterfucker!

404
00:58:01,588 --> 00:58:06,287
Bharat, Madho,
coIIect money, aII of it.

405
00:58:07,494 --> 00:58:10,156
He'II have to go to a city doctor.

406
00:58:45,065 --> 00:58:50,367
The buIIet has grazed the bone,
but I couId fix it.

407
00:59:26,106 --> 00:59:28,006
He knows who we are.

408
01:00:24,531 --> 01:00:25,930
How did I fuck?

409
01:00:26,032 --> 01:00:30,992
What did you do?
I did aII the work.

410
01:00:31,104 --> 01:00:35,234
- That's how men do it in the city.
- ReaIIy? It's siIIy.

411
01:00:41,581 --> 01:00:44,812
Let's see you naked.
Just once.

412
01:00:52,625 --> 01:00:54,286
You're fiIthy.

413
01:01:04,037 --> 01:01:07,165
- In the city, they do it naked.
- I'II cry for heIp.

414
01:01:08,174 --> 01:01:13,840
I'm PhooIan Devi!
Vikram wants to fuck me!

415
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:04,423
- Who is it?
- The buIIet doctor sent me.

416
01:02:07,167 --> 01:02:10,500
- What does he want?
- Cash.

417
01:02:10,603 --> 01:02:13,003
- We paid.
- For the dressings.

418
01:02:13,106 --> 01:02:15,666
Now he wants his fee.
His sister's getting married.

419
01:02:17,210 --> 01:02:20,907
The bridegroom wants a scooter.
Six thousand.

420
01:02:21,014 --> 01:02:24,040
- Tomorrow.
- Too Iate.

421
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:28,610
I'II have to fetch the cash.

422
01:02:28,721 --> 01:02:30,052
I'II come with you.

423
01:02:30,156 --> 01:02:34,058
I'II give the doctor his corn,
not show him the fieId.

424
01:02:35,195 --> 01:02:37,425
I'II be back in an hour.

425
01:04:35,615 --> 01:04:41,110
She's caused enough troubIe.
What's she back for?

426
01:04:41,221 --> 01:04:44,281
She's our daughter.
Where eIse wouId she go?

427
01:04:44,390 --> 01:04:46,358
To her husband.

428
01:04:47,393 --> 01:04:51,454
That's where she beIongs.

429
01:04:51,564 --> 01:04:55,398
That's worse than jaiI.

430
01:04:55,501 --> 01:04:57,264
Do you know what--

431
01:05:01,341 --> 01:05:04,310
PhooIan,
peopIe recognize you here.

432
01:05:04,410 --> 01:05:07,345
We'd better Ieave,
or there'II be troubIe.

433
01:05:08,982 --> 01:05:11,280
No offense to you, Vikram,

434
01:05:11,384 --> 01:05:15,753
but a girI shouId Iive
with her husband.

435
01:05:15,855 --> 01:05:17,152
The same fucking shit!

436
01:05:20,093 --> 01:05:22,789
See how she speaks to her father?

437
01:05:24,364 --> 01:05:26,924
Vikram, have I said
something wrong?

438
01:05:27,467 --> 01:05:31,096
She shouId go to...

439
01:05:31,404 --> 01:05:35,306
AII right, I'II go to my husband.

440
01:05:35,408 --> 01:05:39,208
I'II do what you shouId have done
Iong ago.

441
01:05:39,312 --> 01:05:41,246
Let's go, Vikram.

442
01:06:03,269 --> 01:06:08,229
- Come out, PuttiIaI, you bastard!
- Don't beat me, pIease.

443
01:06:18,885 --> 01:06:23,754
What do you want?
I'm a poor man.

444
01:06:26,592 --> 01:06:28,389
I have nothing.

445
01:07:14,574 --> 01:07:18,032
- Forgive me.
- Forgive you?

446
01:07:30,456 --> 01:07:34,256
Write this to the poIice.

447
01:07:35,428 --> 01:07:36,656
What?

448
01:07:36,763 --> 01:07:42,030
Any man that marries
a IittIe girI...

449
01:07:42,135 --> 01:07:44,729
I'II kiII him.

450
01:09:32,305 --> 01:09:35,206
I've never seen that side of you.

451
01:09:36,609 --> 01:09:38,600
Where did you get the strength?

452
01:09:40,046 --> 01:09:44,380
I don't know. I ache aII over.

453
01:09:45,985 --> 01:09:52,288
But I feeI at peace,
Iike after a piIgrimage.

454
01:09:56,228 --> 01:09:57,889
That's good.

455
01:10:01,167 --> 01:10:03,601
The gang wiII meet us here.

456
01:10:03,703 --> 01:10:06,399
- I'II go on the mound.
- And me?

457
01:10:07,673 --> 01:10:09,140
You rest.

458
01:10:11,210 --> 01:10:15,044
You've avenged your honor.

459
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:22,949
Now you're a reaI bandit,
Iike the rest of us.

460
01:10:27,226 --> 01:10:28,352
But remember...

461
01:10:30,696 --> 01:10:33,824
if you kiII, kiII at Ieast 20.

462
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:38,158
- Why?
- KiII one, and they'II hang you.

463
01:10:38,270 --> 01:10:43,731
KiII 20, and you're famous.

464
01:10:43,843 --> 01:10:47,540
They'II beg you to surrender.

465
01:10:48,881 --> 01:10:50,872
Even give you a pension.

466
01:10:56,589 --> 01:10:57,988
Mastana.

467
01:11:01,694 --> 01:11:04,492
Why did you become a bandit?

468
01:11:06,132 --> 01:11:07,963
Not for the name.

469
01:11:10,469 --> 01:11:13,927
I heard... you were married.

470
01:11:22,047 --> 01:11:24,447
I heard you were, too.

471
01:11:31,123 --> 01:11:35,150
Marriage is Iike
how my parents are.

472
01:11:35,928 --> 01:11:38,192
What was I born of?

473
01:11:38,297 --> 01:11:41,892
An act of Iove or of vioIence?

474
01:12:05,191 --> 01:12:10,185
Show yourseIves, you motherfuckers!

475
01:14:02,041 --> 01:14:05,374
- Don't hit me.
- What eIse are you fit for?

476
01:14:06,946 --> 01:14:10,245
Vikram was a fooI to pamper you.

477
01:17:28,814 --> 01:17:30,782
Draw water from the weII.

478
01:17:33,252 --> 01:17:34,947
I'm thirsty.

479
01:18:00,012 --> 01:18:01,673
Now, go Iike this.

480
01:18:08,187 --> 01:18:10,178
Go, or I'II smash you.

481
01:19:21,793 --> 01:19:26,890
Look, this is the queen
of the ravines!

482
01:19:28,233 --> 01:19:33,432
PhooIan Devi,
they caII her a goddess!

483
01:19:37,175 --> 01:19:41,373
This thing caIIed me
a motherfucker!

484
01:19:48,453 --> 01:19:53,618
This is what we do
to Iow caste goddesses!

485
01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:22,346
KaiIash.

486
01:21:03,895 --> 01:21:05,362
PhooIan.

487
01:21:19,878 --> 01:21:21,436
Vikram...

488
01:21:24,383 --> 01:21:26,317
Shh. Someone's coming.

489
01:21:36,094 --> 01:21:37,789
You can have me, too.

490
01:21:39,865 --> 01:21:43,164
Have you gone mad?

491
01:21:51,676 --> 01:21:54,702
You are PhooIan, PhooIan Devi.

492
01:21:57,416 --> 01:22:02,547
Look at me.
I'm just a fat sIob.

493
01:22:03,655 --> 01:22:07,614
Yet the viIIage saIutes me.

494
01:22:07,726 --> 01:22:10,388
Why? Because I'm your cousin.

495
01:22:11,096 --> 01:22:13,360
WiII he heIp me?

496
01:22:16,701 --> 01:22:18,794
Nab Singh was Vikram's comrade.

497
01:22:20,572 --> 01:22:24,201
- I don't trust any man.
- You trusted Vikram.

498
01:22:35,420 --> 01:22:39,447
Baba, I've brought this woman
without your permission.

499
01:22:40,892 --> 01:22:42,723
She wants a favor.

500
01:22:42,828 --> 01:22:47,060
I know of her.
She caIIs herseIf Devi.

501
01:22:52,237 --> 01:22:53,636
Greetings, Baba.

502
01:22:55,173 --> 01:22:57,505
She was Vikram's woman.

503
01:22:58,376 --> 01:23:03,507
I warned Vikram that SriRam and LaIaRam
were poIice informers,

504
01:23:03,615 --> 01:23:06,550
but he wouIdn't beIieve me,
so he's dead.

505
01:23:06,651 --> 01:23:08,585
Not just those brothers.

506
01:23:11,356 --> 01:23:17,659
I have sworn to fight
the whoIe Thakur cIan.

507
01:23:18,797 --> 01:23:21,925
Watch your tongue.
You're a woman, and of a Iow caste.

508
01:23:22,033 --> 01:23:23,830
SiIence.

509
01:23:23,935 --> 01:23:25,960
Bandits know no caste.

510
01:23:26,071 --> 01:23:28,539
Those two caIIed themseIves
bandits, too.

511
01:23:30,242 --> 01:23:32,039
They raped me...

512
01:23:34,045 --> 01:23:36,479
stripped me and...

513
01:23:41,153 --> 01:23:46,250
I know. I am sorry.
But now what?

514
01:23:47,325 --> 01:23:49,919
Your men are mostIy MusIims.

515
01:23:50,028 --> 01:23:52,258
They do not yet beIieve in caste.

516
01:23:54,366 --> 01:23:58,860
But soon the caste thing wiII turn
the whoIe bandit kingdom upside-down.

517
01:24:01,339 --> 01:24:06,003
This woman is troubIe, Baba.
What does she want?

518
01:24:06,111 --> 01:24:11,413
She wants her own gang.
Let's see what support she has.

519
01:24:16,121 --> 01:24:18,954
Who is with this woman?

520
01:24:21,126 --> 01:24:22,354
I am.

521
01:24:25,263 --> 01:24:26,491
And I.

522
01:24:33,872 --> 01:24:35,237
I'm with Man Singh.

523
01:24:42,847 --> 01:24:46,977
Man Singh, you've aIways wanted
your own gang.

524
01:24:47,085 --> 01:24:48,848
You now have a partner.

525
01:24:48,954 --> 01:24:50,819
Go ahead.

526
01:24:55,860 --> 01:24:58,920
What can a woman do?

527
01:24:59,030 --> 01:25:01,794
And a share for my other gun?

528
01:25:05,170 --> 01:25:07,434
An extra gun aIways gets
an extra share.

529
01:25:07,539 --> 01:25:10,997
PoIice uniforms. Twenty-five.

530
01:25:11,843 --> 01:25:15,506
And 16 guns.

531
01:25:15,614 --> 01:25:18,242
- How many don't work?
- Five.

532
01:25:18,350 --> 01:25:21,251
Twenty-five men, sixteen guns,
five duds...

533
01:25:21,353 --> 01:25:25,187
and you want to raid Jangamajpur.

534
01:25:25,290 --> 01:25:30,990
There'II be at Ieast 50 poIicemen.
Even Mushtaquim wouIdn't try this.

535
01:25:33,031 --> 01:25:35,226
Vikram wouId.

536
01:26:31,690 --> 01:26:35,626
PeopIe of Jangamajpur,
Iisten carefuIIy!

537
01:26:36,795 --> 01:26:39,855
This is the Man Singh
and PhooIan gang.

538
01:26:43,601 --> 01:26:46,832
The poor have nothing to fear.

539
01:26:47,105 --> 01:26:53,669
Anyone who tries to stop us
or cIose their shops wiII be shot.

540
01:27:07,592 --> 01:27:11,255
Women and chiIdren, go in,
do not be scared.

541
01:27:39,190 --> 01:27:40,680
Open up!

542
01:27:58,877 --> 01:28:02,574
Out of here, motherfucker!

543
01:28:02,680 --> 01:28:03,806
The poIice!

544
01:28:05,850 --> 01:28:07,147
What?

545
01:28:55,033 --> 01:28:56,728
Run, PhooIan!

546
01:29:01,539 --> 01:29:04,906
The poIice are here!

547
01:29:05,009 --> 01:29:08,240
You want me, bastards?
Here I am!

548
01:29:19,724 --> 01:29:23,057
- What's your name?
- Damayanti.

549
01:29:26,064 --> 01:29:29,227
- What does your father do?
- He drinks.

550
01:29:29,334 --> 01:29:31,325
Want to come with me?

551
01:29:33,471 --> 01:29:37,601
Keep this. For your wedding.

552
01:31:38,029 --> 01:31:39,929
Long Iive PhooIan Devi!

553
01:31:53,945 --> 01:31:57,176
Love Iive Baba Mushtaquim!

554
01:32:22,540 --> 01:32:26,135
Your name echoes
throughout the Iand.

555
01:32:27,512 --> 01:32:30,242
You are considered a terror.

556
01:32:30,581 --> 01:32:32,981
With your bIessings, Baba.

557
01:32:33,084 --> 01:32:34,642
I have news.

558
01:32:37,255 --> 01:32:40,349
- There's onIy one thing I want to hear.
- I know.

559
01:32:40,458 --> 01:32:45,395
SriRam and LaIaRam
wiII be attending a wedding.

560
01:32:45,930 --> 01:32:48,091
- Where?
- Behmai.

561
01:33:01,345 --> 01:33:02,972
Listen.

562
01:33:03,781 --> 01:33:07,410
Don't do anything rash.

563
01:35:22,687 --> 01:35:26,384
PeopIe of Behmai!

564
01:35:27,391 --> 01:35:30,849
We've come for SriRam and LaIaRam.

565
01:35:31,462 --> 01:35:34,954
We know they are here.

566
01:35:35,066 --> 01:35:36,863
Surrender quietIy.

567
01:35:38,336 --> 01:35:43,899
Any resistance
wiII be met with buIIets.

568
01:35:46,711 --> 01:35:50,647
Women and chiIdren need not fear.

569
01:35:53,284 --> 01:35:55,013
We've come for SriRam and LaIaRam.

570
01:35:58,623 --> 01:36:00,682
Find them!

571
01:36:00,858 --> 01:36:03,759
Smash the doors.
Bring every man out.

572
01:36:05,463 --> 01:36:07,658
Don't touch women and chiIdren.

573
01:36:07,965 --> 01:36:11,332
They watched the fun
whiIe I was raped.

574
01:37:14,732 --> 01:37:17,030
Sisterfucking Thakurs!

575
01:37:20,137 --> 01:37:24,005
You took my honor here.

576
01:37:42,193 --> 01:37:44,252
Where is your Ieader?

577
01:37:50,768 --> 01:37:52,736
I don't know.

578
01:37:52,837 --> 01:37:55,704
Where's he hiding?

579
01:37:57,341 --> 01:37:59,366
- Don't know.
- TeII me!

580
01:38:01,612 --> 01:38:04,513
I swear I don't know!

581
01:38:21,232 --> 01:38:23,666
Where's your Ieader, sisterfucker?

582
01:41:02,660 --> 01:41:06,790
What prospect is there of catching
PhooIan Devi and her gang?

583
01:41:06,897 --> 01:41:10,333
She's a woman, Iow caste.
We'II catch her sooner or Iater.

584
01:41:10,434 --> 01:41:13,926
You journaIists are giving her
unnecessary pubIicity.

585
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:08,958
She didn't get SriRam and LaIaRam.
She kiIIed 24 innocent Thakurs.

586
01:42:10,394 --> 01:42:15,058
I, too, have kiIIed,
but not for nothing.

587
01:42:19,770 --> 01:42:25,231
The pIace is crawIing with cops...

588
01:42:25,342 --> 01:42:28,709
Iike Iice in a beggar's bIanket.

589
01:42:31,415 --> 01:42:34,748
Soon they'II set the army on us.

590
01:42:37,388 --> 01:42:41,415
Each of those dead Thakurs wiII have
some fucking reIative in the government.

591
01:42:45,262 --> 01:42:49,198
She'II die a horribIe death.

592
01:42:50,868 --> 01:42:54,429
Worms wiII feed on her corpse.
BIoody bitch goddess.

593
01:44:48,285 --> 01:44:52,244
We've surrendered. Don't shoot!

594
01:45:34,064 --> 01:45:35,895
Where are the others?

595
01:45:35,999 --> 01:45:41,062
PoIice attack... at river...
aII dead.

596
01:45:42,372 --> 01:45:44,135
Speak cIearIy.

597
01:45:44,241 --> 01:45:50,976
Run away. Don't go near water.

598
01:45:51,081 --> 01:45:53,072
Look at this.

599
01:46:01,124 --> 01:46:02,523
You brought buIIets?

600
01:46:07,331 --> 01:46:09,856
He says it's aII over.

601
01:46:11,335 --> 01:46:16,363
So he turns coward
at the first sign of danger.

602
01:46:25,849 --> 01:46:29,148
- I've seen enough corpses.
- Look carefuIIy.

603
01:46:32,289 --> 01:46:33,586
Bharat and Madho.

604
01:46:35,526 --> 01:46:37,585
Shot them from this cIose.

605
01:46:39,930 --> 01:46:44,264
Munna ran. Shot him in the Iegs.

606
01:46:46,637 --> 01:46:48,832
Then a bayonet through his throat.

607
01:46:50,941 --> 01:46:53,432
Girdhari had one buIIet.

608
01:46:54,845 --> 01:46:56,870
Shot himseIf.

609
01:47:01,919 --> 01:47:04,615
The poIice went to Ateek
and SuItan's viIIage.

610
01:47:06,523 --> 01:47:09,424
They were stripped naked
and kiIIed in front of their famiIies.

611
01:47:13,297 --> 01:47:16,960
The poIice say
they wiII kiII us aII...

612
01:47:18,869 --> 01:47:20,996
unIess you surrender.

613
01:48:37,814 --> 01:48:41,113
They've poisoned the water.

614
01:49:47,284 --> 01:49:49,252
KaiIash, have you got guns?

615
01:49:51,588 --> 01:49:52,987
I've got water.

616
01:50:14,511 --> 01:50:19,039
KaiIash, you've come to heIp me,
haven't you?

617
01:50:40,804 --> 01:50:42,328
KaiIash, wait.

618
01:50:48,845 --> 01:50:52,406
My gang wiII come.

619
01:50:54,417 --> 01:50:55,975
WiII you bring them?

620
01:51:00,056 --> 01:51:01,990
Hey, my baIdy!

621
01:51:02,893 --> 01:51:06,192
No one wiII come.
They're aII dead.

622
01:51:06,863 --> 01:51:11,698
I'II form a new gang
or join another gang.

623
01:51:11,802 --> 01:51:16,136
They wiII kiII you... and me, too.

624
01:51:16,840 --> 01:51:21,174
Why, you, my oId baIdy?

625
01:51:22,746 --> 01:51:24,543
I'm your cousin, that's why.

626
01:51:32,355 --> 01:51:34,448
I am PhooIan Devi!

627
01:51:38,094 --> 01:51:40,062
Queen of these ravines.

628
01:51:41,464 --> 01:51:42,988
I wiII stay here.

629
01:51:48,071 --> 01:51:51,336
The ravines wiII hide me
in their womb.

630
01:51:53,777 --> 01:51:56,644
They cannot hide you now.

631
01:51:56,746 --> 01:52:01,206
Come on out.
It's time to be reborn again.

632
01:52:01,318 --> 01:52:05,812
Time to face the reaI worId.

633
01:52:16,933 --> 01:52:20,300
- Dad wants you.
- I've brought two buckets of water.

634
01:52:28,278 --> 01:52:31,076
Come out, you whore!

635
01:52:31,181 --> 01:52:34,673
I can smeII you, fiIthy bitch!
You stink even worse.

636
01:52:44,794 --> 01:52:47,922
I'II give you more pIeasure
than Vikram couId.

637
01:52:53,203 --> 01:52:57,765
We know you are rotting,
you have no buIIets.

638
01:53:02,612 --> 01:53:06,878
The press makes you out to be
some kind of a goddess.

639
01:53:12,055 --> 01:53:14,956
But you're good
for onIy one thing now.

640
01:53:19,396 --> 01:53:21,864
You know what, don't you?

641
01:53:25,402 --> 01:53:27,370
Remember my rod?

642
01:53:32,175 --> 01:53:35,736
You must be Ionging for it.

643
01:53:35,979 --> 01:53:41,815
Lots of peopIe want you naked here,
even more than Behmai.

644
01:53:47,691 --> 01:53:49,591
Motherfucker!

645
01:53:53,396 --> 01:53:58,390
We kiIIed Vikram.
Now Man Singh wiII die because of you.

646
01:54:00,103 --> 01:54:01,570
Let's move on.

647
01:54:31,701 --> 01:54:34,795
Get away! Don't come near me!

648
01:54:37,173 --> 01:54:38,731
Go and surrender!

649
01:54:42,278 --> 01:54:47,341
I'II teII Vikram you're a coward!
He'II beat you!

650
01:54:56,493 --> 01:54:58,825
The goddess is angry with me.

651
01:55:07,937 --> 01:55:12,965
There were buIIets for everyone.
For Bharat, for Madho.

652
01:55:16,112 --> 01:55:18,478
There are no buIIets for me.

653
01:55:28,992 --> 01:55:31,392
I want my mother.

654
01:55:34,431 --> 01:55:36,228
I want my father.

655
01:56:08,631 --> 01:56:11,293
My terms of surrender:

656
01:56:11,401 --> 01:56:14,495
Our famiIies must be protected...

657
01:56:14,604 --> 01:56:18,096
and given Iand to Iive.

658
01:56:18,208 --> 01:56:22,668
After reIease, we shouId be given
gun Iicenses for our security.

659
01:56:29,152 --> 01:56:31,746
AII our chiIdren...

660
01:56:32,689 --> 01:56:35,658

661
01:56:35,758 --> 01:56:41,128

01:56:41,231 --> 01:56:45,895
and her gang wiII surrender...

663
