1
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,131
It's an impressive collection.
You have some very rare editions here.

2
00:05:28,827 --> 00:05:30,566
Are you sure you want
to send them all?

3
00:05:30,784 --> 00:05:33,003
They're of no use to father, not anymore.

4
00:05:33,394 --> 00:05:35,654
Not since he's been this way.

5
00:05:35,874 --> 00:05:38,308
His library was his whole world.
Now it's just...

6
00:05:38,568 --> 00:05:39,918
...a painful memory.

7
00:05:40,093 --> 00:05:41,787
Unbearably painful.

8
00:05:43,658 --> 00:05:44,918
I understand.

9
00:05:46,529 --> 00:05:47,365
Well,

10
00:05:48,093 --> 00:05:51,617
at a rough preliminary estimate

11
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:53,531
you have a collection here

12
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,663
- worth around 600,000 dollars.
- 600,000?

13
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:59,358
Yes, worth that about.

14
00:06:00,663 --> 00:06:02,576
I have picked up one or two volumes

15
00:06:02,577 --> 00:06:04,316
that merit special attention.

16
00:06:04,578 --> 00:06:07,186
This "Persiles", for example,
is important.

17
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:10,014
I'd hang on to that.
It'll never depreciate.

18
00:06:10,233 --> 00:06:12,406
- It's a good investment.
- Valuable?

19
00:06:12,798 --> 00:06:14,060
Very valuable.

20
00:06:14,712 --> 00:06:17,886
As for this "Hypneratomachia di Poliphilo"

21
00:06:18,452 --> 00:06:21,016
by Colonna, Venice, 1545,

22
00:06:22,234 --> 00:06:24,542
I'm sure I can find you a buyer.

23
00:06:24,758 --> 00:06:27,714
But I wouldn't let the rest go
for less than 500,000

24
00:06:27,977 --> 00:06:29,629
under any circumstances.

25
00:06:31,281 --> 00:06:32,978
It may take a month to sort of place them

26
00:06:33,152 --> 00:06:34,980
so in the meantime
I advise you to be patient

27
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,065
A month?

28
00:06:36,239 --> 00:06:38,371
Yes, a month or two, depends on
how much of a hurry you're in, and see,

29
00:06:38,372 --> 00:06:41,023
more hurry, less money.

30
00:06:41,197 --> 00:06:44,894
- Of course.
- Well, that's my advice anyway.

31
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,452
I'm sure you wouldn't
want to rush things

32
00:06:47,454 --> 00:06:49,706
but please feel free
to consult another expert

33
00:06:49,811 --> 00:06:52,071
aand if you have any questions
you know where to reach me.

34
00:06:52,288 --> 00:06:55,594
Incidentally, this
four-volume edition

35
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:59,856
of "Don Quixote" is quite nice,
but not particularly valuable.

36
00:07:00,073 --> 00:07:02,464
Now, I could

37
00:07:02,726 --> 00:07:04,946
take it off your hands

38
00:07:06,032 --> 00:07:07,074
right away.

39
00:07:10,902 --> 00:07:13,164
How much were you thinking of?

40
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,035
Oh, I couldn't go more
than 4,000 - 4,200

41
00:07:17,644 --> 00:07:18,861
Oh, fine.

42
00:07:27,995 --> 00:07:29,300
- You here?
- Hello Witkin.

43
00:07:29,431 --> 00:07:30,516
You didn't waste much time.

44
00:07:30,518 --> 00:07:32,909
Listen, there's a small fortune
in there. Help yourself.

45
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,475
You're a vulture Corso!
A vulture!

46
00:07:35,476 --> 00:07:38,433
- Who isn't in our business?
- You'd stuck to anything.

47
00:07:38,434 --> 00:07:40,738
For a Quixote by Ybarra? You bet I would.

48
00:07:40,739 --> 00:07:43,871
Unscrupulous!
Thoroughly unscrupulous!

49
00:07:44,217 --> 00:07:45,522
Happy hunting.

50
00:08:05,266 --> 00:08:09,096
I've just got on the phone
with Witkin. He's spitting blood.

51
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,747
Really? What's his problem?

52
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:17,793
He said you're a double-dealing
moneygrabbing bastard.

53
00:08:18,925 --> 00:08:23,100
He thought he had that deal sold up.
He said you queered his pitch.

54
00:08:23,142 --> 00:08:25,272
He should have been quicker
and offer them more.

55
00:08:25,577 --> 00:08:28,100
- May I?
- Sure.

56
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:31,362
And he said your evaluation
was way over the top.

57
00:08:31,755 --> 00:08:34,407
And those people coming out in a rash

58
00:08:34,841 --> 00:08:37,973
now they're asking twice
what those books are worth.

59
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:44,888
Let's face it.

60
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:48,409
- You screw it off, that's what it's called.
- That's what it's called.

61
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:51,110
He also said that you snatched the "Don Qui-"

62
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:02,155
Ybarra, "Don Quixote", 1780.

63
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,068
All four volumes.

64
00:09:05,243 --> 00:09:09,070
Son of a bitch.
Fantastic.

65
00:09:09,071 --> 00:09:11,505
Fantastic, you are the best.

66
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,550
That client of yours, the Swiss, d'ya think
he'd still be interested in this edition?

67
00:09:15,767 --> 00:09:18,727
I have Witkin on my ass, I really
told him I had no part in this operation.

68
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,813
Except 10%.

69
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,206
20%. The Swiss is my client.

70
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:25,815
No deal.

71
00:09:26,031 --> 00:09:29,207
- 15, for my children's sake.
- You don't have any children.

72
00:09:29,381 --> 00:09:30,816
I'm still young, give me time.

73
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:32,872
Ten.

74
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:18,222
...and earlier in 1580, in
"De la Dèmonomanie des sorciers"

75
00:10:18,439 --> 00:10:20,266
by the French Jean Bodin.

76
00:10:20,701 --> 00:10:25,512
Bodin was probably the first
to attempt to estabilish a system,

77
00:10:25,577 --> 00:10:29,258
if the term "system" may be
applied to the Middle Ages,

78
00:10:29,603 --> 00:10:32,378
for classifying the contemporary
perceptions of evil.

79
00:10:33,139 --> 00:10:37,620
In Bodin we find one of the first
definitions of the word "witch".

80
00:10:37,836 --> 00:10:39,012
I quote:

81
00:10:40,245 --> 00:10:41,436
"A witch is a person

82
00:10:41,437 --> 00:10:44,144
who, though cognizant in the laws of God,

83
00:10:44,318 --> 00:10:48,274
endeavours to act thorugh the medium
of a pact with the Devil.

84
00:10:48,275 --> 00:10:52,274
To assist them in their work,
many witches kept familiars,

85
00:10:52,624 --> 00:10:55,407
that is to say creatures
such as cats or toads

86
00:10:55,668 --> 00:10:59,931
in which supernatural spirits
or demons were thought to reside.

87
00:11:00,365 --> 00:11:03,410
For those of you, ladies and
gentlemen who wish to dare more deeply

88
00:11:03,584 --> 00:11:05,976
into the controvertial
subject of witchcraft,

89
00:11:06,194 --> 00:11:07,932
a great deal of
relevant information

90
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:10,402
may be found
in the following works:

91
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:13,632
Nicolas Remis "Demonolatriae libri"

92
00:11:13,848 --> 00:11:17,284
and "Compendium Maleficarum",
by Francesco Maria Guazo.

93
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:31,072
I see you were stimulated
by my little talk, Mr. Corso.

94
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:35,899
Did I snore?

95
00:11:36,116 --> 00:11:39,942
Most nice of you to ask.
No, not that I noticed.

96
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,423
Shall we go?

97
00:11:51,164 --> 00:11:53,557
- Don't you sleep nice?
- Like a baby.

98
00:11:53,818 --> 00:11:55,296
Strange.

99
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:57,599
I'd have bet a brace
of Gutenberg Bibles

100
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,559
you spend half the night
with your eyes peeled

101
00:12:00,689 --> 00:12:03,691
You're one of those lean,
hungry restless types

102
00:12:03,733 --> 00:12:05,517
that put the wind up Julius Caesar.

103
00:12:05,689 --> 00:12:08,692
Men who stab their
friends in the back.

104
00:12:12,258 --> 00:12:15,520
Not that I suspect you have
many friends, do you Mr. Corso?

105
00:12:15,521 --> 00:12:17,607
Your kind seldom does.

106
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:19,739
That makes two of us.

107
00:12:27,045 --> 00:12:28,741
You're right, of course.

108
00:12:29,002 --> 00:12:31,525
Your friendships don't
concern me in the least.

109
00:12:31,697 --> 00:12:35,265
Our relations have always been strictly
commercial, and that's the way I like it.

110
00:12:35,439 --> 00:12:38,614
The professional and the personal
should be mutually exclusive.

111
00:12:38,831 --> 00:12:41,964
Listen, I came here to do some
business, not to shoot to breeze.

112
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,965
If you want to expound you personal
philosophies, write another book.

113
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,312
You don't like me, do you?

114
00:12:47,529 --> 00:12:49,965
I don't have to like you.
You're a client and you pay well.

115
00:13:05,231 --> 00:13:07,275
You're a priviledged, Mr. Corso.

116
00:13:07,798 --> 00:13:10,537
Very few people
ever set foot in here.

117
00:13:10,538 --> 00:13:12,668
This is my private collection.

118
00:13:13,451 --> 00:13:17,103
Some bibliophiles specialise
in gothic novels,

119
00:13:17,366 --> 00:13:18,278
others in Books of Hours.

120
00:13:19,627 --> 00:13:22,844
All my own rare editions
have the same protagonist:

121
00:13:23,495 --> 00:13:24,368
the Devil.

122
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:26,891
- May I take a look?
- Yes.

123
00:13:27,151 --> 00:13:28,368
That's why I brought you here.

124
00:13:44,547 --> 00:13:46,024
Beautiful, aren't they?

125
00:13:46,896 --> 00:13:50,244
Their soft sheen,
their superb guilding,

126
00:13:51,158 --> 00:13:54,204
not to mention the centuries
of wisdom they contain.

127
00:13:54,419 --> 00:13:57,030
I know people who would kill
for a collection like this.

128
00:13:58,073 --> 00:13:59,727
The "Ars Diavoli".

129
00:14:00,335 --> 00:14:04,378
You'll never see as many books
on the subject anywhere else in the world.

130
00:14:04,857 --> 00:14:08,120
They're the rarest, the choicest
editions in existence.

131
00:14:08,338 --> 00:14:10,557
It's taken me a lifetime
to assemble them.

132
00:14:10,905 --> 00:14:13,513
Only the supreme
masterpiece was missing.

133
00:14:14,209 --> 00:14:15,252
Come.

134
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:26,460
"The Nine Gates of the
Kingdom of Shadows".

135
00:14:26,692 --> 00:14:30,954
- You're familiar with it.
- Yes, Venice 1666.

136
00:14:31,084 --> 00:14:35,303
The author and printer Aristide Torchia
was burned by the Holy Inquisition

137
00:14:35,607 --> 00:14:36,825
together with all his works.

138
00:14:37,824 --> 00:14:40,522
- Only three copies survived.
- One.

139
00:14:40,828 --> 00:14:43,653
The Catalogue has three copies
surviving, of private ownership:

140
00:14:43,654 --> 00:14:46,174
the Fargas, the Kessler
and the Telfer.

141
00:14:46,175 --> 00:14:49,872
It's true, you know your business.
But you're mistaken nonetheless.

142
00:14:50,134 --> 00:14:52,829
According to my own research,
only one is authentic.

143
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,483
Well, three are known.

144
00:14:55,266 --> 00:14:56,657
That's the trouble.

145
00:14:57,613 --> 00:15:00,789
- Where did you get it?
- I bought it from Telfer.

146
00:15:01,353 --> 00:15:03,834
- Telfer?
- Yes, he fnally sold it to me.

147
00:15:04,094 --> 00:15:06,095
The day before he killed himself.

148
00:15:07,052 --> 00:15:08,574
That's good timing.

149
00:15:17,098 --> 00:15:19,186
"Silentium est aureum".

150
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,100
- Silence is golden.
- Precisely.

151
00:15:24,449 --> 00:15:26,448
Ever heard of the "Delomelanicon"?

152
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:29,580
I have heard of it, yes.
It's a myth, isn't it?

153
00:15:30,102 --> 00:15:32,364
A book reputed to have been
written by Satan himself

154
00:15:32,582 --> 00:15:35,278
No myth. That book existed.

155
00:15:35,582 --> 00:15:37,669
Torchia actually acquired it.

156
00:15:40,976 --> 00:15:46,152
The engravings you are now admiring were
adapted by Torchia from the "Delomelanicon".

157
00:15:46,935 --> 00:15:49,760
They form a kind of satanic riddle.

158
00:15:50,676 --> 00:15:53,305
Correctly interpreted with
the aid of the original text,

159
00:15:53,306 --> 00:15:54,675
and sufficient inside information,

160
00:15:54,676 --> 00:15:58,892
they're reputed to conjure up
the Prince of Darkness in person.

161
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,981
You don't say.

162
00:16:02,677 --> 00:16:04,678
Are you a religious man, Mr. Corso?

163
00:16:04,939 --> 00:16:07,810
I mean, do you believe in the supernatural?

164
00:16:08,071 --> 00:16:10,115
I believe in my percentage.

165
00:16:12,767 --> 00:16:14,681
Aren't you getting
dizzy standing there?

166
00:16:19,162 --> 00:16:21,032
What is it that you
want from me, Balkan?

167
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,468
I want you to go
to Europe and investigate.

168
00:16:29,772 --> 00:16:32,685
The other two copies
are in Portugal and France.

169
00:16:32,686 --> 00:16:35,667
I want you to find some way
of comparing them with mine.

170
00:16:35,668 --> 00:16:38,646
Every page, every engraving,
the binding, everything.

171
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:41,603
I'm convinced only one is authentic
I wanna know which.

172
00:16:41,604 --> 00:16:43,387
That can be an expensive trip.

173
00:16:45,256 --> 00:16:48,649
That's to get you started.
Spend what you need.

174
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,048
What if I find that
your copy's a forgery?

175
00:16:53,215 --> 00:16:54,277
It's quite possible.

176
00:16:55,172 --> 00:16:56,171
Really?

177
00:16:58,087 --> 00:16:59,695
It doesn't appear to be.

178
00:17:02,871 --> 00:17:04,522
Even the paper sounds couture.

179
00:17:04,655 --> 00:17:07,220
Even so, something's wrong.

180
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,350
You mean the Devil won't show up.

181
00:17:12,004 --> 00:17:16,440
If all three copies turn out to be bogus
or incomplete your work will be done.

182
00:17:16,442 --> 00:17:20,877
If, on the other hand, one of them turns out
to be genuine, I'll finance you further.

183
00:17:21,094 --> 00:17:22,442
I want you to get it for me.

184
00:17:23,181 --> 00:17:25,574
At all costs. Nevermind how.

185
00:17:25,661 --> 00:17:27,445
"Nevermind how" sounds illegal.

186
00:17:27,661 --> 00:17:30,532
It wouldn't be the first time
you've done something illegal.

187
00:17:30,533 --> 00:17:33,402
- Not that illegal.
- Hence the size of the check.

188
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:41,014
Do a good job.
I'll double it.

189
00:17:45,015 --> 00:17:47,884
There's gotta be something wrong with it
if you're letting it out of your hands.

190
00:17:47,885 --> 00:17:50,363
I have the outmost faith
in you, Mr. Corso.

191
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:54,714
There's nothing more reliable than a man
whose loyalty can be bought for hand cash.

192
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,515
Good morning. Dean Corso.

193
00:18:57,776 --> 00:19:00,473
I'm terribly sorry to disturb you
at a time like this.

194
00:19:11,867 --> 00:19:16,522
It would be very helpful ma'am
if you could tell me what you know about

195
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:17,870
this book.

196
00:19:26,392 --> 00:19:29,222
- Isn't this one of my husband's books?
- Right.

197
00:19:29,786 --> 00:19:33,571
It was in his collection until very
recently. He sold it to a client of mine.

198
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,528
I'm trying to authenticate it.

199
00:19:35,743 --> 00:19:37,092
He sold it, you say?

200
00:19:37,701 --> 00:19:40,442
How strange, this was one of his
most treasured possessions.

201
00:19:40,529 --> 00:19:43,790
- He never mentioned this sale?
- No, it's news to me.

202
00:19:44,703 --> 00:19:47,835
- Who bought it?
- A private collector.

203
00:19:48,532 --> 00:19:49,880
May I know his name?

204
00:19:51,227 --> 00:19:52,836
I'm afraid that's confidential.

205
00:19:53,272 --> 00:19:56,534
- I suppose he has a bill of sale.
- No problem there.

206
00:19:56,535 --> 00:19:59,795
Is this your job?
Authenticating rare books?

207
00:19:59,796 --> 00:20:01,449
And tracking them down, yes.

208
00:20:02,406 --> 00:20:05,145
- You're a book-detective.
- Kind of.

209
00:20:07,145 --> 00:20:10,278
Do you recall when and where
your husband acquired this book?

210
00:20:12,321 --> 00:20:13,496
In Spain.

211
00:20:14,061 --> 00:20:18,627
We were vacationing at Toledo.
Andrew was very excited.

212
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:21,194
He paid a great deal of money for it.

213
00:20:22,237 --> 00:20:24,238
He was a fanatical collector.

214
00:20:24,499 --> 00:20:25,483
So I gather.

215
00:20:27,412 --> 00:20:28,327
I'll show you.

216
00:20:50,289 --> 00:20:51,724
It's impressive.

217
00:20:51,943 --> 00:20:54,422
Andrew used to spend
many hours in here.

218
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:57,204
Too many.

219
00:20:57,728 --> 00:20:58,901
Did he ever try it out?

220
00:21:00,293 --> 00:21:01,379
I don't understand.

221
00:21:01,988 --> 00:21:02,729
The book.

222
00:21:03,902 --> 00:21:06,577
Did he ever use it to perform
some kind of ritual

223
00:21:06,578 --> 00:21:09,251
intended to produce
a supernatural effect?

224
00:21:09,514 --> 00:21:12,253
- Are you serious?
- Yes, absolutely.

225
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,647
Andrew was a trifle
eccentric, Mr. Corso,

226
00:21:16,691 --> 00:21:18,559
But he wasn't insane.

227
00:21:18,863 --> 00:21:21,081
It's true he'd been acting

228
00:21:22,518 --> 00:21:24,344
strange in those last few days,

229
00:21:24,562 --> 00:21:28,910
he shut himself up in here,
he seldom emerged, except for meals.

230
00:21:29,954 --> 00:21:34,130
That morning I was awoken
by the screams of the maid.

231
00:21:38,609 --> 00:21:39,956
He'd hanged himself.

232
00:21:43,827 --> 00:21:45,428
Whatever he was up to,

233
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:50,353
I certainly can't see him chanting
mambo jambo or trying to raise the dead.

234
00:21:50,354 --> 00:21:55,528
The Devil, Mrs. Telfer.
This book is designed to raise the Devil.

235
00:22:47,631 --> 00:22:50,806
"Sic luceat lux".

236
00:22:52,023 --> 00:22:54,153
"Thus might the light shine".

237
00:25:51,819 --> 00:25:54,602
Son of a bitch.
Where did you get this?

238
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:55,821
Balkan.

239
00:25:56,211 --> 00:25:58,124
He wants me to research it.

240
00:25:58,863 --> 00:26:01,126
Balkan owns a "Nine Gates"?

241
00:26:01,345 --> 00:26:04,257
Recently acquired by
the late lamented Andrew Telfer.

242
00:26:04,474 --> 00:26:05,563
Trust Balkan...

243
00:26:05,781 --> 00:26:09,041
What does he need you for?
I don't suppose he plans to sell it?

244
00:26:09,475 --> 00:26:11,998
He wants me to compare it
with the other two survival copies

245
00:26:11,999 --> 00:26:14,398
which are in Portugal and France.

246
00:26:14,609 --> 00:26:16,437
So I'm off to Europe.

247
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:17,608
Compare it?

248
00:26:18,435 --> 00:26:21,437
Yes. Only one of the three
is authentic, he says.

249
00:26:22,306 --> 00:26:24,483
But this looks genuine enough.

250
00:26:25,177 --> 00:26:29,396
Chrissake, it's gotta be worth
a million. Take care of it.

251
00:26:29,569 --> 00:26:32,743
That's why I'm here.
I need you to stash it for me.

252
00:26:33,572 --> 00:26:35,095
'Cause I'm starting to see things.

253
00:26:35,137 --> 00:26:38,529
- Like what?
- Uninvited visitors, unfamiliar faces.

254
00:26:39,442 --> 00:26:41,791
I don't trust anyone,
not even Balkan.

255
00:26:42,704 --> 00:26:44,356
I come to think I'm not
even sure I trust you.

256
00:26:45,269 --> 00:26:47,597
You know I wouldn't screw you
unless there was a good reason:

257
00:26:48,254 --> 00:26:49,872
money, women, business...

258
00:26:50,012 --> 00:26:51,662
Other than that you can relax.

259
00:26:53,055 --> 00:26:55,447
- I'll take it up on my way to the airport.
- Sure.

260
00:26:57,275 --> 00:26:59,274
These engravings are terrific.

261
00:26:59,666 --> 00:27:01,709
Or horrific, whichever.

262
00:27:02,188 --> 00:27:05,147
Sensational,
absolutely sensational.

263
00:27:48,855 --> 00:27:50,074
May I come in?

264
00:28:00,642 --> 00:28:01,685
Please, sit down.

265
00:28:05,556 --> 00:28:07,601
I've come to talk business.

266
00:28:09,905 --> 00:28:12,602
Yesterday, when you came
to see me about that book,

267
00:28:15,211 --> 00:28:18,127
I was too surprised to react
as I should have done.

268
00:28:18,344 --> 00:28:20,734
I mean it really was one
of Andrew's favourites.

269
00:28:21,473 --> 00:28:22,519
So you said.

270
00:28:22,953 --> 00:28:24,649
I'd like to get it back.

271
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:29,215
- That could be a problem.
- Not necessarily, it all depends.

272
00:28:29,216 --> 00:28:31,870
- On what?
- On you.

273
00:28:32,434 --> 00:28:35,826
I don't understand, Mrs. Terfel.
The book is not mine to dispose of.

274
00:28:45,654 --> 00:28:47,221
You work for money, I take it?

275
00:28:47,395 --> 00:28:48,352
What else?

276
00:28:48,482 --> 00:28:51,049
- I have a great deal of money.
- I'm very happy for you.

277
00:28:51,267 --> 00:28:52,744
You could stage a theft.

278
00:28:52,962 --> 00:28:55,224
I imagine your client
is well insured.

279
00:28:57,784 --> 00:28:57,832
- I'm a professional, ma'am.
- You're a professional mercenary.

280
00:28:58,008 --> 00:29:00,099
Mercenaries work
for the highest bidder.

281
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,964
I could throw in a bonus.

282
00:29:05,706 --> 00:29:09,314
- This has happened before in some place.
- I know, in the movies.

283
00:29:09,315 --> 00:29:11,013
She had an automatic her stocking...

284
00:29:15,491 --> 00:29:17,100
No automatic.

285
00:29:26,841 --> 00:29:29,104
- Would you like a drink?
- Why not?

286
00:31:01,263 --> 00:31:03,046
Okay. Where is it?

287
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:04,915
Where's what?

288
00:31:05,743 --> 00:31:07,614
Don't fuck with me!

289
00:31:09,657 --> 00:31:11,266
I thought I already did.

290
00:31:42,798 --> 00:31:47,364
<i>You have reached "Bernie's Rare Books".
Please leave your message after the beep.</i>

291
00:31:49,017 --> 00:31:50,888
Bernie, you there?

292
00:31:52,715 --> 00:31:53,758
Pick up.

293
00:32:23,464 --> 00:32:25,202
Give me a minute, I won't be long.

294
00:32:25,333 --> 00:32:28,160
- Then you can take me on the "Kennedy"
- No problem sir.

295
00:33:03,911 --> 00:33:05,171
Oh Jesus!

296
00:33:21,654 --> 00:33:23,090
Jesus Christ...

297
00:34:25,154 --> 00:34:26,414
None problem?

298
00:35:03,077 --> 00:35:03,905
Stop.

299
00:35:04,427 --> 00:35:06,167
Stop by that phone booth, pull over.

300
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:07,645
No problem sir.

301
00:35:14,517 --> 00:35:16,735
He isn't available at the time.
May I know who's calling?

302
00:35:17,995 --> 00:35:21,866
- You'd like to leave a message?
- No, I have to talk with him at once.

303
00:35:22,085 --> 00:35:23,251
I'm afraid he is in transit.

304
00:35:23,252 --> 00:35:24,418
If you can give me your number,

305
00:35:24,419 --> 00:35:26,628
I'll have him return it
when he checks us.

306
00:35:26,912 --> 00:35:30,042
No, I'm in a phone booth.
It's an emergency.

307
00:35:30,694 --> 00:35:33,871
I have to speak with him right now.
Right now, do you hear me?

308
00:35:33,872 --> 00:35:34,870
Right now.

309
00:35:36,741 --> 00:35:37,698
One moment.

310
00:35:55,922 --> 00:35:57,488
- Are you there, Mr. Corso?
- Yeah.

311
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:58,791
Ok, I'll put him through.

312
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:05,534
Mr. Corso, what have you got for me?

313
00:36:05,793 --> 00:36:07,316
More than I'd bargained for.

314
00:36:07,663 --> 00:36:09,967
- What do you mean?
- I mean I quit.

315
00:36:10,405 --> 00:36:12,318
I wanna return you the
book. Where are you?

316
00:36:12,535 --> 00:36:16,668
I'm disappointed in you, Mr. Corso.
You never let me down before.

317
00:36:17,057 --> 00:36:18,928
Well, this is different.

318
00:36:19,449 --> 00:36:21,277
Do you remember Bernie Orenstein?

319
00:36:22,563 --> 00:36:23,632
The dealer?

320
00:36:23,736 --> 00:36:25,816
I gave him your book
to stash it for me

321
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:28,104
and now he's dead, murdered.

322
00:36:28,366 --> 00:36:30,888
- Because of the book?
- What else?

323
00:36:32,192 --> 00:36:36,108
Look, I've never said it would be easy.
If it's a question of money...

324
00:36:36,238 --> 00:36:37,847
It isn't the money, I want out.

325
00:36:38,022 --> 00:36:40,631
This matter means a great
deal to me, Mr. Corso.

326
00:36:40,847 --> 00:36:42,760
I'm not an ungenerous man,
you know that.

327
00:36:42,978 --> 00:36:47,284
Proceed as arranged, and you can
tack another zero onto your fee.

328
00:36:48,678 --> 00:36:50,806
What... Hey, where are you?

329
00:37:45,738 --> 00:37:49,174
- Good evening.
- Good evening. Come in.

330
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,349
- You speak English?
- Yes, I do.

331
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:56,089
I would like to get your opinion on this.

332
00:38:07,484 --> 00:38:10,224
What a habit for a book binder...

333
00:38:10,833 --> 00:38:14,443
"The Nine Gates" - superb
edition. Very rare.

334
00:38:15,095 --> 00:38:16,442
The Telfer copy.

335
00:38:17,051 --> 00:38:19,400
Yes. You used to own it, right?

336
00:38:19,443 --> 00:38:21,051
- We used to, yes.
- We sold it.

337
00:38:21,052 --> 00:38:24,445
...when the opportunity
presented itself. It was too good to..

338
00:38:24,446 --> 00:38:26,881
...too good to miss. An excellent sale.

339
00:38:26,925 --> 00:38:29,620
An excellent buying!
Impeccable condition.

340
00:38:29,621 --> 00:38:32,362
Impeccable.
Are you the present owner?

341
00:38:32,535 --> 00:38:34,188
No, A client of mine.

342
00:38:34,622 --> 00:38:38,103
I would never have believed
she would part with it. Never.

343
00:38:38,537 --> 00:38:40,494
- She?
- Mrs. Telfer.

344
00:38:43,322 --> 00:38:46,106
I understood that it was
Mr. Telfer that had bought it.

345
00:38:46,192 --> 00:38:47,453
He'd pay for it.

346
00:38:48,019 --> 00:38:50,112
It was Mrs. Telfer
who made him buy it.

347
00:38:50,113 --> 00:38:52,208
- He didn't seem particularly...
- ...interested.

348
00:38:54,108 --> 00:38:56,369
An exceptional specimen.

349
00:38:56,543 --> 00:38:59,977
- Do you think it could be a forgery?
- Forgery? Hear that, Pablo?

350
00:39:00,064 --> 00:39:03,849
I took you for a professional.
You speak too lightly of forgeries.

351
00:39:03,851 --> 00:39:05,154
Far too lightly.

352
00:39:05,589 --> 00:39:08,415
Forging a book is very expensive.

353
00:39:08,634 --> 00:39:12,939
Paper of the period, right inks,
Too expensive to be profitable.

354
00:39:13,157 --> 00:39:15,505
- Still it can be done.
- Of course.

355
00:39:15,506 --> 00:39:17,897
It requires a great skill,
but yes it can be done.

356
00:39:18,157 --> 00:39:19,985
Do you think that
could be the case here?

357
00:39:20,332 --> 00:39:21,334
What makes you ask?

358
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:25,205
My client wishes to satisfy
himself on the book's authenticity.

359
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:28,552
His name's Balkan.
Boris Balkan of New York.

360
00:39:28,553 --> 00:39:32,162
- All books have a destiny of their own.
- And a life of their own.

361
00:39:32,728 --> 00:39:35,643
Mr. Balkan is a celebrated collector.

362
00:39:35,859 --> 00:39:38,773
He's no fool, he must know
this book is authentic.

363
00:39:39,121 --> 00:39:40,599
- We know it.
- So must he.

364
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,906
- We've had this book for years.
- Many years.

365
00:39:42,948 --> 00:39:45,122
With ample opportunity
to study it thoroughly.

366
00:39:45,731 --> 00:39:47,210
The printing, the binding,

367
00:39:47,211 --> 00:39:50,994
are magnificent examples of
17th century Venetian craftsmanship.

368
00:39:51,082 --> 00:39:55,017
Finest rag-paper.
Resistent to the passage of time.

369
00:39:55,272 --> 00:39:57,766
None of your modern wood-pulp.

370
00:39:58,346 --> 00:40:00,128
Watermarks, ink,

371
00:40:00,344 --> 00:40:01,999
typefaces...

372
00:40:02,302 --> 00:40:03,302
If this is a forgery,

373
00:40:03,303 --> 00:40:07,218
or a copy with missing pages
restored, is the work of a master.

374
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:14,826
Have you studied the engravings? They
seem to have some underlying significance.

375
00:40:14,914 --> 00:40:16,350
But of course.

376
00:40:16,351 --> 00:40:17,567
Here, for example.

377
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:21,199
This one could be
interpreted as a warning:

378
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,571
"Venture too far" it seems to say,
"and danger will descend on you from above".

379
00:40:25,787 --> 00:40:28,485
These types of books
often contain little puzzles.

380
00:40:28,658 --> 00:40:31,703
Especially in the case of
such an illustruous collaborator.

381
00:40:32,181 --> 00:40:33,311
Collaborator?

382
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:36,268
You could have not proceeded,
very far in your research, Señor.

383
00:40:36,966 --> 00:40:38,226
Here. look close.

384
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,097
Don't you see? Only six of the nine
engravings were signed by Aristide Torchia.

385
00:40:43,444 --> 00:40:45,664
Yes. And the other three?

386
00:40:46,359 --> 00:40:47,924
This is one of them.

387
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,796
L, C, F.

388
00:40:52,405 --> 00:40:53,362
Who's LCF?

389
00:40:53,623 --> 00:40:54,493
Think.

390
00:41:01,016 --> 00:41:02,017
Lucifer?

391
00:41:03,712 --> 00:41:06,714
Very perceptive of you, Señor.

392
00:41:07,671 --> 00:41:09,679
Torchia was burnt alive

393
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:12,644
because he wrote this book
in collaboration with someone else.

394
00:41:12,674 --> 00:41:14,454
Come on. You can't honestly believe...

395
00:41:14,456 --> 00:41:18,195
The man who wrote this book
did so in alliance with the Devil

396
00:41:18,325 --> 00:41:20,066
and went to the stake for it.

397
00:41:20,152 --> 00:41:22,894
Even hell has its heroes, Señor.

398
00:43:18,059 --> 00:43:20,366
- I have seen you before.
- Have you?

399
00:43:20,894 --> 00:43:21,815
Yes.

400
00:43:22,497 --> 00:43:26,019
- Are you travelling in this car?
- The next one.

401
00:43:26,105 --> 00:43:29,193
The sleeper... I travel on the cheap.

402
00:43:30,977 --> 00:43:33,889
- Are you a student?
- Something like that.

403
00:43:35,108 --> 00:43:36,500
I like trains.

404
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:40,068
- Trains I'm on?
- Just trains.

405
00:43:43,283 --> 00:43:44,503
What's your name?

406
00:43:45,111 --> 00:43:46,111
Guess.

407
00:43:48,329 --> 00:43:50,374
- Green eyes?
- That'll do.

408
00:43:50,766 --> 00:43:53,112
- What's yours?
- Corso.

409
00:43:53,286 --> 00:43:54,506
Strange name.

410
00:43:55,375 --> 00:43:57,288
Italian, it means "to run".

411
00:43:57,984 --> 00:44:01,941
You don't look like a runner to me.
You're more the quiet type.

412
00:44:06,074 --> 00:44:11,250
Well, give my regards to Balkan.
Tell him I'm doing my best.

413
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:14,728
- Balkan?
- Nevermind.

414
00:44:15,467 --> 00:44:16,816
See you around.

415
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:18,729
Maybe.

416
00:44:20,513 --> 00:44:22,384
I wouldn't be surprised.

417
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:01,752
Yes?

418
00:46:02,632 --> 00:46:04,807
Yes... Dean Corso, Mr. Fargas.

419
00:46:05,111 --> 00:46:10,679
- Corso? Oh yes, please come in.
- Thank you.

420
00:46:15,853 --> 00:46:17,202
Please.

421
00:46:22,725 --> 00:46:24,203
Home sweet home.

422
00:46:28,508 --> 00:46:31,076
You won't say no
to a brandy I take it?

423
00:46:31,424 --> 00:46:32,642
Thank you very much.

424
00:46:46,941 --> 00:46:47,811
Thank you.

425
00:46:49,517 --> 00:46:51,343
What handsome glasses.

426
00:46:51,605 --> 00:46:53,866
They're the only ones I have left.

427
00:46:58,085 --> 00:47:01,086
- It has to have been a beautiful place.
- It was.

428
00:47:01,434 --> 00:47:04,391
But old families are
like ancient civilisations,

429
00:47:04,392 --> 00:47:06,174
they wither and die.

430
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:13,393
There they are, 834 of them.

431
00:47:13,568 --> 00:47:16,611
What a pity you didn't
see them in better times.

432
00:47:16,656 --> 00:47:18,439
I used to have 5,000.

433
00:47:18,657 --> 00:47:20,874
But these are the survivors.

434
00:47:21,047 --> 00:47:23,180
So this is the Fargas collection.

435
00:47:23,831 --> 00:47:25,962
Not quite as I imagined it I must say.

436
00:47:26,312 --> 00:47:27,875
C'est la vie, my friend.

437
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:32,792
But I keep them in perfect conditions,
safe from damp, light, heat, rats.

438
00:47:33,226 --> 00:47:35,226
I dust and air them every day.

439
00:47:40,228 --> 00:47:42,053
These are the occult.

440
00:47:42,751 --> 00:47:45,621
- What do you think?
- Not bad.

441
00:47:45,795 --> 00:47:48,970
Not bad indeed. At least
ten of them are extremely rare.

442
00:47:49,578 --> 00:47:52,580
Here: Plancy, "Dictionnaire Infernal",

443
00:47:53,581 --> 00:47:56,972
first edition, 1844.

444
00:47:59,147 --> 00:48:03,496
Leonardo Fioravanti's
"Compendi dei Secreti", 1571.

445
00:48:09,586 --> 00:48:11,195
And there it is,

446
00:48:11,802 --> 00:48:13,631
in perfect condition.

447
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:20,474
It has travelled the world
for three and a half centuries,

448
00:48:20,475 --> 00:48:22,803
yet it might have been
printed yesterday.

449
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:26,982
Is it in order? I mean you
haven't detected anything unusual?

450
00:48:27,201 --> 00:48:28,635
Unusual? no.

451
00:48:28,721 --> 00:48:32,462
The text is complete, the engravings too,
nine plus the title page's,

452
00:48:32,896 --> 00:48:37,072
as the catalogue states, just like the
Kessler in Paris and the Telfer in New York.

453
00:48:38,117 --> 00:48:40,812
Yes... It isn't the Telfer anymore.

454
00:48:41,245 --> 00:48:42,683
Telfer killed himself.

455
00:48:42,987 --> 00:48:45,719
But he sold his copy
to Boris Balkan first.

456
00:48:46,143 --> 00:48:47,538
Oh, Balkan.

457
00:48:48,121 --> 00:48:51,729
If he sets his eye on a book
no price is too high.

458
00:48:51,948 --> 00:48:55,513
Not that I would ever sell this one.
Not at any price.

459
00:48:57,253 --> 00:49:01,993
It's strange that he should
have sent you here if he...

460
00:49:02,603 --> 00:49:03,601
...already had...

461
00:49:05,863 --> 00:49:07,211
Do you have it here?

462
00:49:08,778 --> 00:49:09,997
May I see it?

463
00:49:28,826 --> 00:49:31,132
Oh, superb.

464
00:49:35,829 --> 00:49:39,788
Beautiful. Identical.

465
00:49:40,005 --> 00:49:42,310
Two of the only three
to escape the flames

466
00:49:42,527 --> 00:49:45,137
reunited for the first time
in over three centuries.

467
00:49:46,876 --> 00:49:48,007
Yes.

468
00:49:48,922 --> 00:49:52,083
Look at this slight imperfection here,
the damaged "S"...

469
00:49:53,009 --> 00:49:55,574
The same type,
the same impression.

470
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,054
Oh, incredible.

471
00:50:00,968 --> 00:50:05,055
As you see if it wasn't for this slight
discoloration on the back of your copy

472
00:50:05,143 --> 00:50:06,837
no one could tell them apart.

473
00:50:07,491 --> 00:50:11,406
If you don't mind I would like to stay
for a while and examine them in detail.

474
00:50:15,059 --> 00:50:17,276
What are you looking for, Mr. Corso?

475
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:19,626
I'm not quite sure.

476
00:50:20,235 --> 00:50:23,583
Some books are dangerous,
not to be opened with impunity.

477
00:50:24,801 --> 00:50:25,933
Very true.

478
00:51:01,248 --> 00:51:03,160
I'll be damned!

479
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:05,899
Hello again.

480
00:54:07,149 --> 00:54:09,700
- You didn't say you were bound for Sintra.
- Neither did you.

481
00:54:09,846 --> 00:54:11,217
What are you doing here?

482
00:54:11,534 --> 00:54:12,360
Reading.

483
00:54:12,957 --> 00:54:14,019
I can see that.

484
00:54:14,188 --> 00:54:17,151
And bumping into people unexpectedly.

485
00:54:17,615 --> 00:54:20,501
Yes, unexpected is right.

486
00:54:21,469 --> 00:54:25,912
Are you on a business trip? Is that
why you always carry that thing around?

487
00:54:31,892 --> 00:54:34,207
- Just part of your course?
- My course?

488
00:54:34,744 --> 00:54:38,538
"Winning friends and influencing
people". You said you're a student.

489
00:54:38,642 --> 00:54:39,439
Did I?

490
00:54:40,338 --> 00:54:42,988
So I am, in a way.

491
00:54:44,595 --> 00:54:47,519
I like books. Do you?

492
00:54:51,177 --> 00:54:53,234
- You been travelling long?
- A while.

493
00:54:54,667 --> 00:54:56,378
I don't suppose you
ever travel by motorbike?

494
00:54:56,379 --> 00:54:59,055
Sir? Excuse me sir.
Phone call for you, sir.

495
00:54:59,661 --> 00:55:03,140
- For me? Are you sure?
- Yes sir. Please sir...

496
00:55:10,231 --> 00:55:12,222
- Yes?
- Mr. Corso?

497
00:55:12,491 --> 00:55:14,475
My God, how did you find me?

498
00:55:14,944 --> 00:55:19,241
- Made any progress?
- Progress? Yeah, you can call it that.

499
00:55:19,402 --> 00:55:20,331
Well?

500
00:55:21,293 --> 00:55:24,634
Look, I can't talk here, I'm in the lobby.
Let me call you back, where are you?

501
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:27,219
Nevermind that. Get them
to transfer it to your room.

502
00:55:27,363 --> 00:55:29,157
- I'll wait.
- Alright.

503
00:55:29,824 --> 00:55:33,741
Señor, pardon me.
Could you send this up to my room?

504
00:55:33,795 --> 00:55:35,124
- Yes.
- Thank you very much.

505
00:55:44,692 --> 00:55:46,361
- Still there?
- Yes.

506
00:55:46,830 --> 00:55:49,615
Alright. I've examined
the Fargas copy.

507
00:55:49,882 --> 00:55:52,262
It's authentic enough,
at least it looks that way.

508
00:55:52,335 --> 00:55:55,213
It's like yours,
but there are discrepancies.

509
00:55:55,481 --> 00:55:56,690
Discrepancies?

510
00:55:58,388 --> 00:56:00,656
The engravings are not identical.

511
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:03,196
Just like keys
in different hands,

512
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:06,479
doorways open in one copy
and bricked up in the other...

513
00:56:06,874 --> 00:56:10,069
- And there's another thing.
- Yes. Yes, go on.

514
00:56:10,872 --> 00:56:15,702
The ones that differ aren't
signed Torchia. They're signed LCF.

515
00:56:18,547 --> 00:56:20,355
- Still there?
- LCF.

516
00:56:20,381 --> 00:56:21,770
Listen, where are you anyway?

517
00:56:21,872 --> 00:56:24,408
I must have that
copy, Mr. Corso.

518
00:56:25,006 --> 00:56:26,298
Get it for me.

519
00:56:27,497 --> 00:56:30,881
The old man wouldn't sell it
to save his life. He said as much.

520
00:56:31,165 --> 00:56:32,259
Did he?

521
00:56:33,988 --> 00:56:37,411
Hello? Hello?

522
00:57:09,166 --> 00:57:10,307
Just a minute!

523
00:57:29,430 --> 00:57:32,151
- What time is it?
- Early, but you have to go.

524
00:57:33,544 --> 00:57:35,762
- Go? Go where?
- To Fargas' place.

525
00:57:35,763 --> 00:57:37,242
I've already seen Fargas.

526
00:57:37,416 --> 00:57:38,763
I think you should see him again.

527
00:57:39,415 --> 00:57:41,791
What is this, some kind of
practical joke? Who are you?

528
00:57:41,895 --> 00:57:45,616
- What do you know about Fargas?
- Get dressed. I'll wait for you outside.

529
00:58:29,317 --> 00:58:31,797
Don't bother. He isn't there.

530
00:58:32,145 --> 00:58:35,449
- Oh really, then where is he?
- Over there.

531
00:59:05,546 --> 00:59:07,026
God Almighty...

532
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:22,509
You want to get inside?

533
00:59:23,421 --> 00:59:24,988
I had thought about it, yes.

534
00:59:48,386 --> 00:59:49,865
You wait here.

535
01:00:14,785 --> 01:00:15,568
Shit!

536
01:00:38,142 --> 01:00:39,836
Well, did you find it?

537
01:00:40,794 --> 01:00:44,055
You know, it's come to my attention
that you know too goddam much.

538
01:00:44,272 --> 01:00:46,662
Why do you keep following me
around? Who are you working for?

539
01:00:46,663 --> 01:00:49,447
You're wasting time asking all
these questions. We better get out of here.

540
01:00:49,448 --> 01:00:52,623
There's a flight from Lisbon to Paris
at noon. We should just make it.

541
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:55,494
- What's with the "we"?
- There are two of us, aren't there?

542
01:00:55,495 --> 01:00:57,060
What happened back there?

543
01:01:03,887 --> 01:01:06,365
The old man caught
someone stealing, I guess.

544
01:01:07,105 --> 01:01:09,890
- And what do you guess happened to him?
- He drowned.

545
01:01:11,021 --> 01:01:13,978
- With a little help from who?
- He's dead, who cares?

546
01:01:13,979 --> 01:01:14,847
I do.

547
01:01:16,022 --> 01:01:17,979
I could easily end up the same way.

548
01:01:18,632 --> 01:01:20,763
Not with me around to look after you.

549
01:01:21,763 --> 01:01:25,198
- Oh I see, you're my guardian angel.
- If you say so...

550
01:01:30,158 --> 01:01:34,116
- Someone is playing a game with me.
- Of course, you're part of it.

551
01:01:35,550 --> 01:01:37,854
And you're getting to like it.

552
01:02:14,435 --> 01:02:15,383
Keep the change.

553
01:02:24,689 --> 01:02:25,661
Hello Gruber.

554
01:02:26,184 --> 01:02:29,229
Hello Mr. Corso.
Delighted to see you again.

555
01:02:29,381 --> 01:02:31,763
We don't have any vacancies, but...

556
01:02:32,925 --> 01:02:35,231
I'm sure I'll be able
to organise something.

557
01:02:38,813 --> 01:02:40,615
- Thank you very much. Please...
- Thank you, sir.

558
01:03:34,627 --> 01:03:36,269
- Excuse me?
- Good morning madam.

559
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:37,960
The Kessler Foundation, please.

560
01:03:37,961 --> 01:03:39,649
- Second floor.
- Thank you.

561
01:04:08,441 --> 01:04:09,486
Good afternoon.

562
01:04:10,053 --> 01:04:13,314
I'm Dean Corso, I have an appointment
with Baroness Kessler.

563
01:04:18,661 --> 01:04:19,532
This way.

564
01:04:29,230 --> 01:04:31,144
You have thirty minutes.

565
01:04:36,842 --> 01:04:38,843
- Yes?
- Monsieur Corso.

566
01:04:39,972 --> 01:04:42,714
Oh yes, Mr. Corso. Come in.

567
01:04:43,279 --> 01:04:45,105
I've heard a great deal about you.

568
01:04:46,801 --> 01:04:49,454
- Nothing good I hope.
- You hoped right.

569
01:04:49,541 --> 01:04:50,671
Thanks, Simone.

570
01:04:50,933 --> 01:04:53,151
Well, I'm reassured,
Baroness, because

571
01:04:53,412 --> 01:04:55,527
in my trade
to be spoken well of

572
01:04:55,573 --> 01:04:58,275
can be professionally disastrous.

573
01:05:00,013 --> 01:05:00,939
My God.

574
01:05:00,979 --> 01:05:04,980
Yes, there it is.
The Kessler Collection.

575
01:05:07,807 --> 01:05:09,633
You know I know your
catalogue almost by heart?

576
01:05:09,746 --> 01:05:11,367
Strange we
haven't met before.

577
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:14,314
Your name is a byword
among dealers and collectors.

578
01:05:15,028 --> 01:05:18,419
But I imagine you know
your own reputation better than I do.

579
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:21,985
Yes, well it does keep the wolf
from the door, so to speak.

580
01:05:22,072 --> 01:05:23,727
I'm sorry Baroness. Where you
in the middle of something?

581
01:05:23,944 --> 01:05:25,640
Of my latest work:

582
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:28,988
"The Devil, History and Myth".
A kind of biography.

583
01:05:29,076 --> 01:05:31,597
It will be published
early next year.

584
01:05:31,858 --> 01:05:34,295
- Why the Devil?
- I saw him one day.

585
01:05:34,512 --> 01:05:38,602
I was 15 years old and I saw him
as plain as I see you now.

586
01:05:38,603 --> 01:05:40,339
It was love at first sight.

587
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:42,486
You know, 300 years ago

588
01:05:42,487 --> 01:05:44,723
you'd have been burned at the
stake for saying something like that.

589
01:05:44,777 --> 01:05:47,211
300 years ago
I wouldn't have said it.

590
01:05:47,776 --> 01:05:50,778
Nor would I have made
a million by writing about it.

591
01:05:51,212 --> 01:05:52,125
Yeah.

592
01:05:52,475 --> 01:05:55,388
What is it you wish
to discuss, Mr. Corso?

593
01:05:56,084 --> 01:05:58,911
There's a book in your collection
I'd like to examine if possible.

594
01:05:59,129 --> 01:06:01,352
It's the book of "The Nine Gates
of the Kingdom of Shadows".

595
01:06:01,353 --> 01:06:04,385
The "Nine Gates"?
An interesting work.

596
01:06:04,739 --> 01:06:06,958
Everyone's been
asking me about it lately.

597
01:06:07,393 --> 01:06:08,132
Is that so?

598
01:06:08,176 --> 01:06:09,262
Follow me.

599
01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:15,785
You truly believe
in the Devil, Baroness?

600
01:06:15,829 --> 01:06:19,352
Enough to devote my life
and my library to him.

601
01:06:20,352 --> 01:06:22,658
Not to mention
many years of work.

602
01:06:23,526 --> 01:06:24,397
Don't you?

603
01:06:24,744 --> 01:06:26,051
Almost.

604
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:30,706
This book demands
a certain amount of faith.

605
01:06:30,747 --> 01:06:33,530
Well, I'm afraid my faith's
in short supply these days.

606
01:06:33,661 --> 01:06:37,575
I know this work extremely well.
I studied it for years.

607
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:39,445
Do you have any doubts
about its authenticity?

608
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:41,924
Not wheresoever.

609
01:06:42,054 --> 01:06:42,881
Are you sure?

610
01:06:42,882 --> 01:06:45,404
My knowledge of
this book is profound.

611
01:06:45,664 --> 01:06:47,360
I wrote a biography of its author.

612
01:06:47,577 --> 01:06:50,667
Yes, I read it: "Aristide Torchia,
the Devil's Apprentice",

613
01:06:50,883 --> 01:06:51,711
Excellent work.

614
01:06:52,145 --> 01:06:53,710
A corageous man.

615
01:06:54,015 --> 01:06:58,320
He died for the sake
of this very book in 1667.

616
01:06:58,407 --> 01:07:01,062
While studying the
Black Arts in Prague,

617
01:07:01,063 --> 01:07:04,105
he acquired a copy of
the dread "Delomelanicon".

618
01:07:04,801 --> 01:07:07,149
This is Torchia's
adaptation of that work

619
01:07:07,150 --> 01:07:09,497
which was written
by Lucifer himself.

620
01:07:10,151 --> 01:07:12,718
After they burned him
at the stake, a secret society

621
01:07:12,719 --> 01:07:15,282
was founded, to
perpetuate its memory,

622
01:07:15,369 --> 01:07:17,411
and preserve its secrets.

623
01:07:17,412 --> 01:07:20,109
"The Order of
the Silver Serpent".

624
01:07:20,762 --> 01:07:21,807
What, a sect?

625
01:07:22,023 --> 01:07:24,109
A kind of witches' coven.

626
01:07:24,111 --> 01:07:27,156
For centuries they've met
to read from this book

627
01:07:27,157 --> 01:07:29,330
and worship
the Prince of Darkness.

628
01:07:29,722 --> 01:07:32,446
Today it's degenerated
into a social club

629
01:07:32,447 --> 01:07:34,810
for bored millionaires
and celebrities,

630
01:07:35,028 --> 01:07:37,334
who use its meetings
as an excuse

631
01:07:37,549 --> 01:07:40,550
to indulge their
jaded sexual appetites.

632
01:07:41,510 --> 01:07:43,161
I myself belonged to the Order,

633
01:07:43,943 --> 01:07:45,029
years ago.

634
01:07:45,031 --> 01:07:47,598
But time is too
precious at my age

635
01:07:47,641 --> 01:07:50,424
besides my orgy
days are over.

636
01:07:50,554 --> 01:07:52,034
I told them to go to the Devil.

637
01:07:54,121 --> 01:07:56,253
You mean it's all about sex or...

638
01:07:56,339 --> 01:07:57,295
Of course not.

639
01:07:57,773 --> 01:08:00,906
They're under the illusion that
they owe their money and success

640
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:02,950
to membership in the Order.

641
01:08:02,951 --> 01:08:04,907
- Do they still meet?
- Every year,

642
01:08:04,952 --> 01:08:07,124
on the anniversary
of Torchia's death.

643
01:08:07,516 --> 01:08:09,342
They'll be meeting
very soon now.

644
01:08:09,604 --> 01:08:12,169
- And you said they read from this book.
- Not this one.

645
01:08:12,386 --> 01:08:16,520
I took mine back when Liana Telfer
acquired the one in Toledo.

646
01:08:16,779 --> 01:08:18,751
Victor Fargas is an unbeliever,

647
01:08:18,780 --> 01:08:23,435
he's always refused to partecipate
so naturally they use the Telfer copy.

648
01:08:23,740 --> 01:08:25,435
Not that it has ever worked.

649
01:08:26,087 --> 01:08:27,653
Did Andrew Telfer ever take part?

650
01:08:27,784 --> 01:08:30,827
Telfer? Oh, no, no...

651
01:08:31,566 --> 01:08:34,960
That creature Liana,
married him for his money.

652
01:08:35,394 --> 01:08:39,049
She comes from an old and
aristocratic French family,

653
01:08:39,050 --> 01:08:41,395
The "De Saint-Martins",
but they were penniless.

654
01:08:41,439 --> 01:08:45,092
So Liana used his dollars
to restore her castle

655
01:08:45,311 --> 01:08:47,180
and buy the "Nine Gates".

656
01:08:47,486 --> 01:08:50,965
If he ever finds out what his wife
gets up to at these gatherings

657
01:08:50,966 --> 01:08:52,704
he'll probably kill himself.

658
01:08:53,617 --> 01:08:57,011
Funny you should say that, Baroness.
He hung himself last week.

659
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:04,837
Who exactly are you
working for, Mr. Corso?

660
01:09:05,186 --> 01:09:07,580
My client's name
is irrelevant, Baroness.

661
01:09:07,581 --> 01:09:09,971
I'm simply trying to
authenticate his copy,

662
01:09:10,057 --> 01:09:12,276
just the one that Telfer
sold him before he died.

663
01:09:12,364 --> 01:09:15,667
How stupid of me!
I should have guessed.

664
01:09:16,582 --> 01:09:20,410
You've out stage
of welcome, Mr. Corso.

665
01:09:20,671 --> 01:09:23,149
I was hoping to examine
your copy in detail.

666
01:09:23,236 --> 01:09:24,411
Certainly not.

667
01:09:25,367 --> 01:09:28,237
Tell your client, who
can only be Boris Balkan,

668
01:09:28,238 --> 01:09:31,934
to come and examinate
himself, if he dares.

669
01:09:32,891 --> 01:09:36,500
Tell him not to send any
more wolves in sheep clothing.

670
01:09:37,675 --> 01:09:40,546
Now kindly leave.

671
01:09:43,416 --> 01:09:47,294
Well, I'm sorry
if I troubled you.

672
01:09:47,399 --> 01:09:48,704
Thank you very much for your time.

673
01:09:48,809 --> 01:09:51,636
You don't know what you're
getting yourself into, Mr. Corso.

674
01:09:53,331 --> 01:09:55,505
Get out before it's too late.

675
01:09:56,290 --> 01:09:59,813
I'm afraid it already is,
Baroness. Good day.

676
01:11:14,575 --> 01:11:15,620
Thanks.

677
01:13:52,014 --> 01:13:53,060
They're broken.

678
01:13:54,756 --> 01:13:56,712
You should be more careful.

679
01:14:12,325 --> 01:14:15,544
- I need a favour, Gruber.
- Certainly, Mr. Corso.

680
01:14:15,762 --> 01:14:17,327
Liana Telfer,

681
01:14:17,674 --> 01:14:21,632
Maiden name De Saint-Martin,
40ish, brunette, dishy,

682
01:14:22,111 --> 01:14:24,243
probably accompanied by

683
01:14:26,374 --> 01:14:29,157
a black gentleman with

684
01:14:30,071 --> 01:14:31,244
closely cropped

685
01:14:31,462 --> 01:14:34,835
platinum blonde hair,
and a moustache.

686
01:14:35,030 --> 01:14:37,466
I wanna know if they're staying
in some hotel here in Paris.

687
01:14:37,552 --> 01:14:38,515
It'll take a little time...

688
01:14:38,516 --> 01:14:41,378
Yes, of course. Start with the
"Five Stars". That's your best bet.

689
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:43,379
- Very well sir.
- Alright.

690
01:14:43,546 --> 01:14:44,959
Are you feeling alright?

691
01:14:46,206 --> 01:14:48,729
I've felt better,
Gruber. Thanks.

692
01:14:49,468 --> 01:14:51,469
Let me know if you locate.

693
01:15:05,169 --> 01:15:06,126
Put this

694
01:15:07,561 --> 01:15:09,648
against the back of your neck.

695
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,436
You were really great
on there by the river.

696
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:26,587
I haven't thanked you for that.

697
01:16:07,713 --> 01:16:09,626
Alright. Look...

698
01:16:10,825 --> 01:16:13,445
I think it's about time you
told me what's going on here.

699
01:16:14,218 --> 01:16:16,763
- Someone's after your book.
- No kidding.

700
01:16:16,819 --> 01:16:18,786
And you? what
do you feed into it?

701
01:16:28,167 --> 01:16:28,960
Yeah?

702
01:16:34,618 --> 01:16:36,663
Can I take it in
the reception please?

703
01:16:38,272 --> 01:16:40,063
Alright. I'll be right down.

704
01:16:54,314 --> 01:16:56,163
- Yes?
- Anything new?

705
01:16:56,628 --> 01:16:58,759
Oh, His Master's voice again.

706
01:16:59,108 --> 01:17:00,484
No, not much,

707
01:17:00,484 --> 01:17:04,062
aside from the fact somene has tried
to take my life a couple of times

708
01:17:04,892 --> 01:17:07,719
Oh yes. Fargas has been murdered.

709
01:17:09,807 --> 01:17:12,088
Murdered? How do you know?

710
01:17:12,442 --> 01:17:14,377
I saw him. And his copy.

711
01:17:14,533 --> 01:17:16,680
Or what was left of it anyway.

712
01:17:17,072 --> 01:17:20,509
Someone had snatched the engravings
and tried to burn the rest.

713
01:17:20,856 --> 01:17:24,171
- What do you make of it?
- It's tragic, it's tragic...

714
01:17:24,423 --> 01:17:27,211
What about Baroness Kessler?
How did you get on today?

715
01:17:27,316 --> 01:17:30,429
- Where exactly are you?
- What about her copy?

716
01:17:30,556 --> 01:17:35,129
No, why do I get the impression that you've
been breathing down my neck the entire time?

717
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:39,467
You're an investment of mine,
Mr. Corso. I'm really looking after it.

718
01:17:42,737 --> 01:17:45,142
The old woman swears
her copy's authentic.

719
01:17:45,302 --> 01:17:47,433
But I didn't get the chance
to examine it closely.

720
01:17:48,129 --> 01:17:51,609
She threw me out as soon as she guessed
that you were behind my visit.

721
01:17:52,348 --> 01:17:55,046
You're not exactly in her
good books, if you know what I mean.

722
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:56,948
You must see her again.

723
01:17:57,254 --> 01:17:59,135
Are you kidding?
Have you seen her secretary?

724
01:17:59,526 --> 01:18:01,324
Try the launch break.

725
01:18:03,689 --> 01:18:04,652
Hello?

726
01:18:33,623 --> 01:18:37,340
- Do you have a photocopy machine back there?
- Yes sir.

727
01:18:37,399 --> 01:18:40,604
- Can I use it?
- Of course, sir.

728
01:18:44,564 --> 01:18:45,737
Thank you.

729
01:21:38,939 --> 01:21:42,975
Yes. Hello, Baroness. It's me,
the wolf in sheep's clothing.

730
01:21:43,671 --> 01:21:47,542
I thought I made myself
bright clear, Mr. Corso.

731
01:21:47,741 --> 01:21:48,564
Well...

732
01:21:49,630 --> 01:21:51,980
I've got something for you, Baroness.

733
01:21:52,241 --> 01:21:56,118
Kind of peace offering.
Will you allow me to give it to you?

734
01:21:56,804 --> 01:21:57,931
Please?

735
01:22:24,342 --> 01:22:26,082
First let me apologise.

736
01:22:26,386 --> 01:22:29,518
I should have told you right away
that I work for Boris Balkan.

737
01:22:30,388 --> 01:22:34,455
It was foolish of me to think that I could
deceive someone as astute as yourself, so

738
01:22:34,563 --> 01:22:35,672
please forgive me.

739
01:22:35,782 --> 01:22:38,784
Flattering will get you
nowhere, Mr. Corso.

740
01:22:39,653 --> 01:22:40,915
Get on with it.

741
01:22:41,614 --> 01:22:42,423
Right.

742
01:22:44,450 --> 01:22:45,834
These

743
01:22:47,786 --> 01:22:49,093
are for you.

744
01:22:51,659 --> 01:22:53,006
What is this?

745
01:22:53,615 --> 01:22:55,531
What is this supposed to be?

746
01:22:56,486 --> 01:23:00,448
You said that your knowledge
of "The Nine Gates" was extensive, but

747
01:23:00,642 --> 01:23:03,049
did you ever compare
your copy with the other two?

748
01:23:03,204 --> 01:23:04,197
No.

749
01:23:04,891 --> 01:23:05,725
Why?

750
01:23:05,820 --> 01:23:07,384
Well, you should.

751
01:23:07,926 --> 01:23:10,952
These are copies of the
engravings in Balkan's book.

752
01:23:11,667 --> 01:23:15,102
- You'll find that some of them differ from yours.
- Differ?

753
01:23:16,540 --> 01:23:19,824
So you question my book's
authenticity, do you?

754
01:23:20,367 --> 01:23:23,299
It that's your peace offering
you can take it and go.

755
01:23:23,369 --> 01:23:25,613
Mine "Nine Gates"
is absolutely genuine.

756
01:23:25,614 --> 01:23:27,458
I don't dispute that, Baroness.

757
01:23:27,589 --> 01:23:30,372
In my opinion all
three copies are genuine.

758
01:23:30,589 --> 01:23:32,981
But the fact remains
they display variations.

759
01:23:33,199 --> 01:23:34,634
Variations?

760
01:23:35,766 --> 01:23:38,724
If that were true
it would be a revelation.

761
01:23:39,202 --> 01:23:40,854
What makes you so sure?

762
01:23:42,464 --> 01:23:44,946
I've already compared these
with the Fargas engravings.

763
01:23:45,727 --> 01:23:46,901
In his book

764
01:23:48,771 --> 01:23:51,686
th keys were in the other hand.

765
01:23:52,860 --> 01:23:55,818
Here the doorway
wasn't bricked up.

766
01:23:56,731 --> 01:24:00,576
And in this one the man
was hanging by the other leg.

767
01:24:17,305 --> 01:24:19,937
- Well?
- Well what?

768
01:24:22,874 --> 01:24:25,179
Look closely, Baroness.

769
01:24:26,658 --> 01:24:27,659
The turrets.

770
01:24:27,963 --> 01:24:31,443
Three in yours,
four in Balkan's.

771
01:24:43,666 --> 01:24:44,623
Amazing.

772
01:24:45,536 --> 01:24:48,450
I'm convinced there'll be
a third one in here somewhere.

773
01:24:49,277 --> 01:24:52,453
Three variations
in three copies makes nine.

774
01:24:53,018 --> 01:24:55,344
Coincidence or something more.

775
01:24:56,063 --> 01:25:00,108
Maybe Torchia hid the secret of
"The Nine Gates" in three books, not one.

776
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:04,632
I must admit I'm impressed.

777
01:25:04,850 --> 01:25:08,206
This puts an entirely different
complexion on the matter.

778
01:25:08,894 --> 01:25:12,592
You have my permission
to investigate further, Mr. Corso.

779
01:25:13,114 --> 01:25:15,158
Take as long as you need.

780
01:25:30,949 --> 01:25:34,984
My permission did not
extend to that, Mr. Corso.

781
01:25:35,820 --> 01:25:38,706
Nobody smokes in my library.

782
01:28:22,877 --> 01:28:23,738
Baroness?

783
01:29:14,401 --> 01:29:15,432
Idiot!

784
01:31:11,842 --> 01:31:14,735
Excuse me. There's something
missing from my room.

785
01:31:14,930 --> 01:31:18,280
- Has anyone been up there while I was out?
- Only your wife, sir.

786
01:31:18,976 --> 01:31:20,759
My wife?
I don't have a wife!

787
01:31:21,535 --> 01:31:22,351
Excuse me sir.

788
01:31:23,064 --> 01:31:25,588
Yes? Yes, he's in front of me.

789
01:31:26,241 --> 01:31:27,196
Alright.

790
01:31:27,457 --> 01:31:29,720
For you sir. Booth nomber two.

791
01:31:35,332 --> 01:31:36,081
Yes?

792
01:31:36,397 --> 01:31:37,506
What news?

793
01:31:39,767 --> 01:31:40,724
News?

794
01:31:41,333 --> 01:31:43,508
Let me see... Well,

795
01:31:44,160 --> 01:31:48,206
yes, the good news is that I got
to examine the old woman's book.

796
01:31:48,858 --> 01:31:51,163
and three of her engravings
were signed LCF.

797
01:31:51,382 --> 01:31:54,165
The bad news is that
someone strangled her

798
01:31:54,470 --> 01:31:57,558
and made a bonfire of her collection.
Now that's tragic, wouldn't you say?

799
01:31:58,152 --> 01:31:59,820
You put the words out of my mouth.

800
01:32:00,429 --> 01:32:03,518
Yes. It's the Fargas story all over again.

801
01:32:03,735 --> 01:32:07,780
I'm of the mind that they tore out the
engravings before they torched the place.

802
01:32:08,171 --> 01:32:09,868
That makes two sets they've got.

803
01:32:10,042 --> 01:32:11,347
And my copy?

804
01:32:12,305 --> 01:32:15,088
Well, I learnt my lesson fortunately.

805
01:32:15,305 --> 01:32:17,493
I don't carry it around
with me anymore

806
01:32:17,841 --> 01:32:19,742
Otherwise it would
have gone up in smoke.

807
01:32:20,340 --> 01:32:22,496
Excellent. Good thinking.

808
01:32:22,569 --> 01:32:26,397
Well, with the two copies gone
that seems to conclude your assignment.

809
01:32:26,615 --> 01:32:28,703
It only remains of you to return my book.

810
01:32:28,919 --> 01:32:31,824
I'm staying at the Ritz.
You can pick up your check at the same time.

811
01:32:32,014 --> 01:32:34,035
Shall we say in half an hour?

812
01:32:35,836 --> 01:32:37,794
There is more bad news.

813
01:32:39,968 --> 01:32:42,326
- I don't have it.
- You don't have it?

814
01:32:43,469 --> 01:32:45,319
Someone lifted it from my room.

815
01:32:49,851 --> 01:32:52,453
Listen to me very
carefully, Mr. Corso.

816
01:32:54,044 --> 01:32:56,367
I think you may
already have some idea

817
01:32:56,585 --> 01:33:00,152
of the length at which I'm prepared
to go when I want something.

818
01:33:01,544 --> 01:33:05,850
Unless you recuperate
my property in double-quick time

819
01:33:07,010 --> 01:33:10,287
you'll discover just
how far that can be.

820
01:33:22,461 --> 01:33:23,251
Where is it?

821
01:33:23,252 --> 01:33:25,033
- Where is what?
- The book. Where is it?

822
01:33:25,703 --> 01:33:28,120
Would I be here if I took it?

823
01:33:28,339 --> 01:33:30,035
You should know better by now.

824
01:33:36,081 --> 01:33:38,764
I must apologise on my
young colleague, Mr. Corso

825
01:33:38,765 --> 01:33:40,483
Was unpardonable.

826
01:33:40,822 --> 01:33:42,040
Is that her?

827
01:33:42,736 --> 01:33:46,911
No sir, she was tall, dark hair,
very chic, very elegant.

828
01:33:46,921 --> 01:33:49,910
Which reminds me sir, I have
the information you wanted.

829
01:33:50,044 --> 01:33:52,144
The lady and gentleman you mentioned

830
01:33:52,351 --> 01:33:55,578
they're staying at the
Plaza Athené Hotel

831
01:33:55,786 --> 01:33:58,649
suite 209-211.

832
01:33:59,370 --> 01:34:02,682
Thank you very much Gruber, I owe
you one. I need a taxi, quick.

833
01:34:02,683 --> 01:34:04,160
<i>A taxi, quick.</i>

834
01:34:05,835 --> 01:34:09,925
Send this to Mr. Balkan
at the Ritz. it's B-A-L-K-A-N.

835
01:34:12,619 --> 01:34:15,193
- Fax it immediately.
- Certainly, sir.

836
01:34:17,230 --> 01:34:19,406
It was a pleasure
to be at your service.

837
01:34:19,666 --> 01:34:20,580
Ain't coming?

838
01:34:41,018 --> 01:34:42,720
What do you plan
to do if you see them?

839
01:34:43,024 --> 01:34:45,112
Probably hide behind you.

840
01:35:39,136 --> 01:35:40,921
Oh, that's them.

841
01:35:44,358 --> 01:35:46,575
We should grab a taxi
before they take off.

842
01:35:48,027 --> 01:35:49,026
Let's go.

843
01:36:07,058 --> 01:36:08,193
They're going.

844
01:36:42,078 --> 01:36:42,818
Coming?

845
01:36:54,605 --> 01:36:56,590
Couldn't you have picked
something a little less conspicuous?

846
01:36:56,694 --> 01:36:58,303
Don't be so picky.

847
01:36:58,477 --> 01:37:00,913
Some people would give
their eyeteeth for driving this.

848
01:37:38,104 --> 01:37:41,062
Listen we can't sit on their tail forever,
they'll bound and smell a rat.

849
01:38:05,899 --> 01:38:07,117
How do I look?

850
01:38:09,205 --> 01:38:10,075
Ridiculous.

851
01:38:18,731 --> 01:38:19,949
Sit tight.

852
01:39:09,307 --> 01:39:10,337
Take your pick.

853
01:39:11,656 --> 01:39:14,065
No, you. You know everything.

854
01:39:14,124 --> 01:39:15,386
If you say so...

855
01:39:29,566 --> 01:39:30,973
We lost them.

856
01:39:31,330 --> 01:39:32,721
No, not at that speed.

857
01:39:33,494 --> 01:39:34,944
They must have gone the other way.

858
01:39:35,095 --> 01:39:36,973
You mean I don't know
everything after all?

859
01:39:38,243 --> 01:39:39,282
Turn around.

860
01:39:53,227 --> 01:39:55,427
30ish, brunette, dishy?

861
01:39:55,984 --> 01:39:58,515
- What was her name again?
- Telfer, Liana Telfer.

862
01:39:58,856 --> 01:40:00,255
No, her maiden name.

863
01:40:02,166 --> 01:40:04,018
- Saint-Martin.
- Look.

864
01:40:45,651 --> 01:40:46,553
Excuse me?

865
01:40:50,776 --> 01:40:53,110
We're looking for the house
of Madame De Saint-Martin.

866
01:40:53,148 --> 01:40:54,522
The castle you mean?

867
01:40:54,541 --> 01:40:55,802
The castle, I knew that.

868
01:40:57,064 --> 01:40:58,546
Where's the castle?

869
01:40:58,780 --> 01:41:00,783
Take the road behind
the Church there.

870
01:41:03,060 --> 01:41:04,658
- Thanks.
- Not at all.

871
01:41:19,713 --> 01:41:20,568
Keep going.

872
01:41:24,364 --> 01:41:25,218
Keep going.

873
01:43:43,995 --> 01:43:45,064
See them anywhere?

874
01:43:49,559 --> 01:43:50,313
No.

875
01:45:19,443 --> 01:45:21,096
Sorry to have to intrude
on you like this.

876
01:45:21,137 --> 01:45:22,708
What are you doing here?

877
01:45:24,479 --> 01:45:26,974
I jumped like to pick up the
book you stole from my room.

878
01:45:26,975 --> 01:45:29,840
- That book is mine.
- We've been through all this before.

879
01:45:30,887 --> 01:45:32,549
My husband gave it to me.

880
01:45:32,727 --> 01:45:34,327
It wasn't his to sell.

881
01:45:34,363 --> 01:45:35,758
He sold it to get back at you?

882
01:45:35,759 --> 01:45:37,703
What happened? Did he
catch you with that albino?

883
01:45:37,704 --> 01:45:38,712
How dare you?

884
01:45:39,719 --> 01:45:40,824
Keep an eye on her.

885
01:45:42,721 --> 01:45:43,490
Don't!

886
01:45:44,331 --> 01:45:45,424
Be careful, she bites.

887
01:45:57,622 --> 01:45:58,462
Hi.

888
01:46:02,289 --> 01:46:05,303
Don't move!
Either one of you.

889
01:46:05,986 --> 01:46:06,987
Get the book.

890
01:46:22,416 --> 01:46:24,628
Don't kill them up here,
you'll make a mess.

891
01:46:25,238 --> 01:46:26,715
Take them downstairs.

892
01:46:28,249 --> 01:46:29,247
You'll go first.

893
01:46:29,937 --> 01:46:30,743
Then you.

894
01:46:43,854 --> 01:46:44,682
Down.

895
01:46:59,949 --> 01:47:01,167
Open the door.

896
01:47:14,434 --> 01:47:15,435
Watch out!

897
01:47:33,547 --> 01:47:35,640
I didn't know you had it in you.

898
01:47:39,074 --> 01:47:44,314
Eight Gates preceed the Serpent
who guards the Word.

899
01:47:44,315 --> 01:47:48,226
<i>We give loyalty to you, Lord.</i>

900
01:47:48,227 --> 01:47:52,282
<i>We devoted our
bodies and souls to you.</i>

901
01:47:52,936 --> 01:47:56,526
<i>The Serpent is a beast
that never sleeps.</i>

902
01:47:56,527 --> 01:48:02,205
<i>A beast whose eyes can
see through the mirror of science.</i>

903
01:48:02,261 --> 01:48:05,782
<i>We give loyalty to you, Lord. We...</i>

904
01:48:06,762 --> 01:48:09,894
Stay here and cover me.
I'm going down.

905
01:48:10,048 --> 01:48:16,234
<i>We won't be afraid of
the noose, or the blade, or the poison.</i>

906
01:48:16,235 --> 01:48:19,372
<i>We give loyalty to you, Lord.</i>

907
01:48:19,580 --> 01:48:23,857
<i>We devoted our
bodies and souls to you.</i>

908
01:48:24,639 --> 01:48:29,852
<i>We'll walk intact through
the lepers and the plague.</i>

909
01:48:30,001 --> 01:48:32,995
<i>We give loyalty to you, Lord.</i>

910
01:48:33,294 --> 01:48:37,063
<i>We devoted our
bodies and souls to you.</i>

911
01:48:37,177 --> 01:48:40,732
<i>The last hidden one
behind which is the Word</i>

912
01:48:40,836 --> 01:48:45,220
<i>is the Ninth one.
Teth, Enneae, Oded.</i>

913
01:48:45,537 --> 01:48:48,647
<i>We give loyalty to you, Lord.</i>

914
01:48:48,891 --> 01:48:52,895
<i>We devoted our
bodies and souls to you.</i>

915
01:48:52,971 --> 01:48:58,212
- Glory to  Eloy, Agla, Zate...
- Mambo Jambo! Mambo Jambo!

916
01:49:06,443 --> 01:49:08,704
Look around you, all of you.
What do you see?

917
01:49:09,487 --> 01:49:12,857
A bunch of buffoons
in fancy dress.

918
01:49:13,589 --> 01:49:15,402
Do you think the Prince
of Darkness would actually

919
01:49:15,403 --> 01:49:17,025
deign to manifest himself

920
01:49:17,056 --> 01:49:20,405
before the lights of you? He
never has and he never will. Never.

921
01:49:22,623 --> 01:49:24,059
You read from his book,

922
01:49:24,450 --> 01:49:27,538
but you have no conception
of its true power.

923
01:49:28,127 --> 01:49:30,105
I alone have grasped its secret,

924
01:49:30,279 --> 01:49:33,452
I alone have fathomed
the Master's grand design.

925
01:49:33,666 --> 01:49:36,287
I alone am worthy to enjoy the fruits

926
01:49:36,574 --> 01:49:41,067
of that discovery: absolute power
to determine my own destiny.

927
01:49:41,068 --> 01:49:42,971
You're insane, Boris.
Give it back to me!

928
01:49:44,278 --> 01:49:46,426
You, Liana de Saint-Martin,

929
01:49:46,982 --> 01:49:49,592
you're even guiltier than
the rest of this pathetic rabble.

930
01:49:50,157 --> 01:49:53,632
You have at least some idea of what
this book can do in the right hands.

931
01:49:53,716 --> 01:49:57,156
Yet you grant yourself
to this farsical proceedings,

932
01:49:57,157 --> 01:49:59,055
to these orgies of aging flesh

933
01:49:59,056 --> 01:50:02,249
conducted in the Master's
name. You're a charlatan!

934
01:50:29,830 --> 01:50:31,867
Don't Corso, don't!

935
01:50:41,268 --> 01:50:42,616
Let it be.

936
01:51:16,805 --> 01:51:17,936
What is it with you?

937
01:51:18,197 --> 01:51:21,415
He just murdered someone
in public. You're off the hook

938
01:51:21,761 --> 01:51:24,498
for the other killings.
You should be grateful.

939
01:51:24,634 --> 01:51:25,591
I'm ecstatic!

940
01:51:25,809 --> 01:51:27,375
You're out of the job, it's over.

941
01:51:27,636 --> 01:51:29,376
- What more do you want?
- You know what.

942
01:51:33,262 --> 01:51:34,267
<i>Wait for me!</i>

943
01:51:56,077 --> 01:51:58,000
Not taking me for a ride?

944
01:51:58,503 --> 01:52:00,246
You were working for him all along.

945
01:52:00,321 --> 01:52:02,178
Funny, I thought you were.

946
01:52:49,180 --> 01:52:50,269
Shit!

947
01:54:31,458 --> 01:54:33,841
- Here you are sir. All's dry.
- Thanks madam.

948
01:54:35,395 --> 01:54:37,073
- Excuse me?
- Yes?

949
01:54:39,505 --> 01:54:41,115
Where is that?

950
01:54:44,160 --> 01:54:46,466
Bernard I need you to
show something to...

951
01:54:55,986 --> 01:54:56,896
Here it is.

952
01:57:01,874 --> 01:57:04,876
<i>Yes, that's it.</i>

953
01:57:09,704 --> 01:57:11,662
<i>Exactly.</i>

954
01:57:12,801 --> 01:57:15,110
<i>One,</i>

955
01:57:15,291 --> 01:57:16,257
four,

956
01:57:16,533 --> 01:57:17,297
three,

957
01:57:18,360 --> 01:57:19,535
six,

958
01:57:20,101 --> 01:57:21,318
seven,

959
01:57:21,840 --> 01:57:23,102
five,

960
01:57:23,449 --> 01:57:26,624
eight, two, nine.

961
01:57:28,104 --> 01:57:31,028
The enigma is solved at last.

962
01:57:32,394 --> 01:57:36,499
"To travel in silence by
a long, unsecured road

963
01:57:36,716 --> 01:57:41,153
to brave the arrows of misfortune
and fear neither noose or fire,

964
01:57:41,371 --> 01:57:43,797
to play the greatest
of all games and win,

965
01:57:43,853 --> 01:57:46,123
forgoing no expense

966
01:57:46,551 --> 01:57:48,217
is to walk the vicissitudes of Fate

967
01:57:48,218 --> 01:57:49,921
and gain at last the key

968
01:57:50,668 --> 01:57:55,499
that will unlock the Ninth Gate ".

969
01:58:00,953 --> 01:58:01,794
Corso?

970
01:58:02,467 --> 01:58:05,207
What were you expecting?
An apparition?

971
01:58:06,919 --> 01:58:09,783
You're not wanted here
Mr. Corso. Leave.

972
01:58:10,761 --> 01:58:13,348
I'm the only apparition
you'll see tonight.

973
01:58:14,172 --> 01:58:16,348
You'll find a check waiting
in my New York office,

974
01:58:16,581 --> 01:58:17,835
payment in full.

975
01:58:18,693 --> 01:58:21,910
You've killed for those.
They're worth more than money.

976
01:58:22,129 --> 01:58:25,960
Infinitely more, but
they happen to be mine,

977
01:58:26,173 --> 01:58:27,158
not yours.

978
01:58:29,132 --> 01:58:31,045
Do you know something, Corso?

979
01:58:32,134 --> 01:58:33,960
In spite of our differences

980
01:58:34,700 --> 01:58:36,788
I have a sort of
bug for you.

981
01:58:37,227 --> 01:58:39,945
- I'm touched.
- We have something in common, you and I.

982
01:58:40,425 --> 01:58:44,793
We share the same passion. You've
developed the same obsession, haven't you?

983
01:58:45,570 --> 01:58:49,280
Unfortunately for you only
one of us is destined to fulfil it.

984
01:58:49,330 --> 01:58:52,057
You're out of your depth.
Kindly go.

985
01:58:53,143 --> 01:58:56,623
- I'm not leaving here empty handed.
- Don't even think about it.

986
01:58:58,343 --> 01:58:59,521
Stand aside.

987
01:59:00,711 --> 01:59:02,509
I credited you with more finesse.

988
01:59:02,764 --> 01:59:05,729
- You heard me? Stand back!
- Put that away, it's not your style.

989
01:59:05,843 --> 01:59:06,916
Don't come near!

990
01:59:28,767 --> 01:59:31,464
Seems you found
your proper niche at last.

991
01:59:32,207 --> 01:59:33,109
I like that.

992
01:59:34,379 --> 01:59:35,379
Now,

993
01:59:37,047 --> 01:59:38,686
you can watch.

994
01:59:47,053 --> 01:59:49,994
I'm entering an uncharted territory.

995
01:59:50,434 --> 01:59:55,171
taking the road that
leads to equality with God.

996
02:00:11,091 --> 02:00:14,526
You can't come with me.
I must travel alone.

997
02:00:14,745 --> 02:00:18,530
But you may look
on me and marvel.

998
02:00:18,791 --> 02:00:21,834
- That's very kind of you.
- Indeed it is.

999
02:00:24,966 --> 02:00:27,925
There have been men
who have been burned alive

1000
02:00:28,142 --> 02:00:31,361
or disembowelled
for just a glimpse

1001
02:00:31,796 --> 02:00:36,102
of what you are about to witness.

1002
02:00:44,193 --> 02:00:46,454
I give you my allegiance, Master.

1003
02:00:46,846 --> 02:00:49,500
I pledge myself to you
body and soul.

1004
02:00:49,716 --> 02:00:53,153
Let me fear neither noose,
nor fire nor poison.

1005
02:00:53,371 --> 02:00:57,503
Erase me from the Book of Life,
inscribe me in the Black Book of Death.

1006
02:00:57,720 --> 02:01:00,896
Admit me to the Ninth Gate.

1007
02:01:01,113 --> 02:01:02,548
Let it be so.

1008
02:01:05,637 --> 02:01:08,335
Let it be so now!

1009
02:01:23,036 --> 02:01:26,778
I feel the power surge through me
like an electric current,

1010
02:01:26,994 --> 02:01:29,038
rendering me
capable of any feat

1011
02:01:29,039 --> 02:01:30,595
of mind or body.

1012
02:01:30,735 --> 02:01:33,860
I'm invulnerable, I'm invincible!

1013
02:01:35,998 --> 02:01:39,783
I can float on air,
I can walk on water.

1014
02:01:45,825 --> 02:01:47,787
I'm plunging my hands in fire,

1015
02:01:48,135 --> 02:01:49,440
I feel no heat!

1016
02:01:50,397 --> 02:01:52,267
This is great,
here's another one.

1017
02:02:04,651 --> 02:02:10,701
Sic dedo me.
Sic exeo me! Sic damno me!

1018
02:02:13,364 --> 02:02:15,190
It's miraculous!

1019
02:02:15,800 --> 02:02:18,496
I feel nothing, nothing at all!

1020
02:05:29,366 --> 02:05:30,496
Is that it?

1021
02:05:31,932 --> 02:05:33,237
Is the game over?

1022
02:05:33,889 --> 02:05:36,586
For Balkan yes.
Not for you.

1023
02:05:36,604 --> 02:05:38,427
Why didn't it work for Balkan?

1024
02:05:38,494 --> 02:05:40,806
The ninth engraving was a forgery.

1025
02:05:44,286 --> 02:05:45,547
Where is the real one?

1026
02:05:47,848 --> 02:05:48,994
I want it.

1027
02:05:52,071 --> 02:05:53,638
You're running low in gas.

1028
02:07:26,078 --> 02:07:30,701
- Hello. Ceniza brothers.
- Sorry?

1029
02:07:31,303 --> 02:07:36,418
- Ceniza brothers?
- Pepe Lopez. Ricardo Herrera.

1030
02:07:37,210 --> 02:07:38,065
Sure...

1031
02:07:39,962 --> 02:07:41,445
Do you speak English?
