1
00:00:08,531 --> 00:00:10,201
- What are they doing?
- Get her.

2
00:00:10,601 --> 00:00:11,700
- What's wrong?
- What is it?

3
00:00:11,701 --> 00:00:13,231
What are you doing?

4
00:00:13,531 --> 00:00:15,470
- Let me go.
- Why are you doing this?

5
00:00:15,471 --> 00:00:16,771
Let go!

6
00:00:19,701 --> 00:00:20,801
Soo Jin!

7
00:00:21,971 --> 00:00:23,031
Soo Jin!

8
00:00:27,431 --> 00:00:28,471
Hey!

9
00:00:33,131 --> 00:00:34,570
That's enough.

10
00:00:34,571 --> 00:00:36,401
Don't mind us and be on your way, Sir.

11
00:00:38,971 --> 00:00:42,671
These jerks are waking
up the beast inside me.

12
00:00:53,471 --> 00:00:56,171
(The morality of our partner
very important to us.)

13
00:00:56,371 --> 00:00:58,230
The morality of our partner
very important to us.

14
00:00:58,231 --> 00:01:00,431
(TQ lost its credit with us.)

15
00:01:00,601 --> 00:01:02,830
TQ lost its credit with us.

16
00:01:02,831 --> 00:01:03,900
I'm sorry, Sir.

17
00:01:03,901 --> 00:01:06,530
The rumors you heard were
made up by our competitors.

18
00:01:06,531 --> 00:01:07,900
(That means you don't have...)

19
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,900
(good relationships with other companies.)

20
00:01:10,901 --> 00:01:13,241
(We think of relationships
as very important.)

21
00:01:14,571 --> 00:01:16,101
That's crazy talk.

22
00:01:16,631 --> 00:01:18,530
So what does he want?

23
00:01:18,531 --> 00:01:20,901
This is an important meeting.
Watch what you say.

24
00:01:21,071 --> 00:01:22,970
(What would you like to say?)

25
00:01:22,971 --> 00:01:27,631
(I was going to withdraw my investment...)

26
00:01:29,301 --> 00:01:30,671
(but I changed my mind.)

27
00:01:30,801 --> 00:01:32,230
Why did he change his mind?

28
00:01:32,231 --> 00:01:33,870
(Why did you change your mind?)

29
00:01:33,871 --> 00:01:39,670
(I'll tell you why later.
First, there are terms.)

30
00:01:39,671 --> 00:01:42,630
I'll tell you why later.
First, there are terms.

31
00:01:42,631 --> 00:01:43,631
What are the terms?

32
00:01:43,632 --> 00:01:46,930
(We can't trust your finance director, )

33
00:01:46,931 --> 00:01:49,570
(so we'll randomly choose
one of your subsidiaries.)

34
00:01:49,571 --> 00:01:51,870
(Then we'll go in and
do a thorough review.)

35
00:01:51,871 --> 00:01:54,401
We'll go in and do a thorough review.

36
00:01:54,831 --> 00:01:57,531
(After the review, we'll
decide whether we'll invest.)

37
00:01:58,771 --> 00:02:02,100
They can't trust our accounting,
so they'll review us.

38
00:02:02,101 --> 00:02:05,670
I'm sorry, but your term
is crossing the line.

39
00:02:05,671 --> 00:02:07,801
(If that's what you think, )

40
00:02:09,201 --> 00:02:10,571
(we'll return to China.)

41
00:02:12,141 --> 00:02:13,571
Okay.

42
00:02:14,771 --> 00:02:15,771
Sit down.

43
00:02:17,501 --> 00:02:18,600
Tell them we'll accept.

44
00:02:18,601 --> 00:02:21,300
Mr. Seo, if we accept
their terms too easily...

45
00:02:21,301 --> 00:02:22,781
If you don't have a solution, shut...

46
00:02:24,071 --> 00:02:26,871
Be quiet. You aren't helping.

47
00:02:27,801 --> 00:02:30,401
(Yes, we'll accept your terms.)

48
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:35,971
(There is one more important term.)

49
00:02:36,301 --> 00:02:38,571
There is one more important term.

50
00:02:40,501 --> 00:02:43,000
You jerks, how dare you forcefully...

51
00:02:43,001 --> 00:02:44,370
drag women?

52
00:02:44,371 --> 00:02:46,100
We're private bodyguards.

53
00:02:46,101 --> 00:02:48,077
We only do as we're told.

54
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:49,331
As you're told?

55
00:02:49,431 --> 00:02:51,700
How can you use violence toward women...

56
00:02:51,701 --> 00:02:53,130
just because you were told?

57
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,571
You should be ashamed!

58
00:02:56,731 --> 00:02:57,900
Are you okay?

59
00:02:57,901 --> 00:02:59,101
Yes, I'm...

60
00:03:00,671 --> 00:03:02,747
Gosh. Wait a minute.

61
00:03:02,771 --> 00:03:04,331
What is it?

62
00:03:08,671 --> 00:03:10,130
I'm okay.

63
00:03:10,131 --> 00:03:11,600
You're not okay.

64
00:03:11,601 --> 00:03:13,631
You look like you have
ketchup on your lips.

65
00:03:16,771 --> 00:03:17,831
Hello?

66
00:03:18,801 --> 00:03:20,031
Yes, Sir.

67
00:03:21,271 --> 00:03:22,370
Take him away.

68
00:03:22,371 --> 00:03:23,800
Take who away?

69
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:25,570
- Hey.
- Come with us.

70
00:03:25,571 --> 00:03:28,900
You jerks! Let go!

71
00:03:28,901 --> 00:03:30,570
Let me go!

72
00:03:30,571 --> 00:03:32,700
Soo Jin, wait here.

73
00:03:32,701 --> 00:03:33,901
Okay.

74
00:03:34,201 --> 00:03:35,900
Let go!

75
00:03:35,901 --> 00:03:38,001
Where are you taking me?

76
00:03:38,971 --> 00:03:41,371
(Yes! That's him!)

77
00:03:45,301 --> 00:03:46,930
- What is he saying?
- Let me go.

78
00:03:46,931 --> 00:03:49,200
I have to go in.

79
00:03:49,201 --> 00:03:51,301
Goodness. Who's in here?

80
00:03:58,931 --> 00:04:01,370
He's here. Tell him to
say the important term.

81
00:04:01,371 --> 00:04:04,530
(We brought him, so tell
us the important term.)

82
00:04:04,531 --> 00:04:07,471
(Include him in the due
diligence preparation team.)

83
00:04:07,701 --> 00:04:10,201
They want him in the due
diligence preparation team.

84
00:04:17,871 --> 00:04:19,630
Do they even know him?

85
00:04:19,631 --> 00:04:21,270
(Do you know him?)

86
00:04:21,271 --> 00:04:22,831
(We do. Seong Ryong.)

87
00:04:24,001 --> 00:04:25,500
(He's the chief of Business Operations, )

88
00:04:25,501 --> 00:04:27,030
(and a righteous man.)

89
00:04:27,031 --> 00:04:28,501
(I saw it on social media.)

90
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,270
He's the chief of Business Operations,

91
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:31,331
and a righteous man.

92
00:04:31,501 --> 00:04:33,471
They saw him on social media.

93
00:04:37,401 --> 00:04:39,947
You're a global celebrity now.

94
00:04:39,971 --> 00:04:42,631
Why does he have to be
included in the team?

95
00:04:43,831 --> 00:04:47,200
(He threw his body to save a person.)

96
00:04:47,201 --> 00:04:49,940
(That means he's honest and dedicated.)

97
00:04:49,941 --> 00:04:52,170
(He won't let his personal feelings...)

98
00:04:52,171 --> 00:04:54,200
(get in the way of assessing his company.)

99
00:04:54,201 --> 00:04:57,231
(I'm sure he'll give a
hard-headed assessment.)

100
00:04:58,801 --> 00:05:01,271
(Because he is a righteous man.)

101
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:03,800
He threw his body to save a person.

102
00:05:03,801 --> 00:05:06,300
That means he's honest and dedicated.

103
00:05:06,301 --> 00:05:08,800
He won't let his personal feelings...

104
00:05:08,801 --> 00:05:10,970
get in the way of assessing his company.

105
00:05:10,971 --> 00:05:13,440
I'm sure he'll give a
hard-headed assessment.

106
00:05:13,441 --> 00:05:15,200
Because he's a righteous man.

107
00:05:15,201 --> 00:05:17,301
He's a righteous man!

108
00:05:17,871 --> 00:05:19,500
- He's a righteous man!
- A righteous man!

109
00:05:19,501 --> 00:05:21,441
- Mr. Righteous!
- Mr. Righteous!

110
00:05:21,701 --> 00:05:23,631
I keep hearing things.

111
00:05:24,171 --> 00:05:26,507
What the heck is he talking about?

112
00:05:26,531 --> 00:05:28,900
Which subsidiary will they choose?

113
00:05:28,901 --> 00:05:29,970
(It's TQ Delivery.)

114
00:05:29,971 --> 00:05:31,431
It's TQ Delivery.

115
00:05:34,231 --> 00:05:35,701
All right.

116
00:05:35,931 --> 00:05:37,800
I'll report to the chairman first.

117
00:05:37,801 --> 00:05:39,430
Then we'll arrange the date.

118
00:05:39,431 --> 00:05:41,570
(He'll report to the chairman first.)

119
00:05:41,571 --> 00:05:44,331
(Then he'll arrange the date.)

120
00:05:44,671 --> 00:05:46,171
I can't do it.

121
00:05:48,371 --> 00:05:50,530
(He says he can't do it.)

122
00:05:50,531 --> 00:05:52,831
(No, he must do it.)

123
00:05:53,801 --> 00:05:56,531
She says he must do it.

124
00:05:56,771 --> 00:05:59,901
He just said he couldn't do it.

125
00:06:00,771 --> 00:06:02,631
The job is too big for me.

126
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,731
Someone who's better than
me should do the job.

127
00:06:06,201 --> 00:06:07,401
Excuse me.

128
00:06:11,801 --> 00:06:13,801
(Why is he leaving?)

129
00:06:19,431 --> 00:06:21,000
I don't think you can leave like this.

130
00:06:21,001 --> 00:06:22,501
That looked really important.

131
00:06:24,631 --> 00:06:26,471
I have a plan.

132
00:06:26,771 --> 00:06:28,131
What plan?

133
00:06:28,801 --> 00:06:31,901
You want them to drop the
charges on Soo Jin, right?

134
00:06:32,731 --> 00:06:33,801
What?

135
00:06:35,131 --> 00:06:37,300
Then wait in the office for a bit.

136
00:06:37,301 --> 00:06:40,401
I'll go back into the waiting room.

137
00:06:44,331 --> 00:06:46,401
He says he doesn't want to do it.

138
00:06:46,571 --> 00:06:49,770
He's not good enough to take that job.

139
00:06:49,771 --> 00:06:51,801
What kind of nonsense are they saying?

140
00:06:52,401 --> 00:06:53,501
No.

141
00:06:54,501 --> 00:06:56,930
I persuaded the executives.

142
00:06:56,931 --> 00:06:58,800
If Chief Kim won't do the job,

143
00:06:58,801 --> 00:07:01,201
this negotiation will be nullified.

144
00:07:03,901 --> 00:07:06,000
This is awkward.

145
00:07:06,001 --> 00:07:08,371
Mr. Seo, from now on,

146
00:07:08,671 --> 00:07:11,031
please use refined language.

147
00:07:14,671 --> 00:07:17,800
That was an unexpected
request, including Chief Kim.

148
00:07:17,801 --> 00:07:21,770
We might find an evidence
during the preparation.

149
00:07:21,771 --> 00:07:25,270
That's possible, but the chances are low.

150
00:07:25,271 --> 00:07:27,600
Instead of doctoring the account books...

151
00:07:27,601 --> 00:07:30,471
I think they're planning
to show the deficit as is.

152
00:07:31,031 --> 00:07:33,100
But just in case,

153
00:07:33,101 --> 00:07:35,101
you should be in the preparation team.

154
00:07:35,471 --> 00:07:36,871
Me?

155
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,670
How can I get in the preparation...

156
00:07:39,671 --> 00:07:41,401
I'll take care of it...

157
00:07:41,531 --> 00:07:43,171
without anyone noticing.

158
00:07:44,701 --> 00:07:45,731
Okay.

159
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:49,371
What do they want?

160
00:07:49,901 --> 00:07:51,270
If it was like our plan, we had to...

161
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:54,201
prepare for the company's
settlement of accounts.

162
00:07:54,331 --> 00:07:57,630
Why did they single out TQ Delivery?

163
00:07:57,631 --> 00:07:59,831
It's a subsidiary which looks
like it is losing money.

164
00:08:00,201 --> 00:08:01,270
They just want to see...

165
00:08:01,271 --> 00:08:03,430
if we will forge its account.

166
00:08:03,431 --> 00:08:05,330
But we have a problem.

167
00:08:05,331 --> 00:08:08,630
TQ Delivery's union is on a
strike since this morning.

168
00:08:08,631 --> 00:08:10,130
They are in front of TQ
Delivery's headquarters.

169
00:08:10,131 --> 00:08:13,130
Then move them before Seoahn
Jangryong Funds sees them.

170
00:08:13,131 --> 00:08:15,170
They will use that to our disadvantage.

171
00:08:15,171 --> 00:08:16,400
We cannot do that right away.

172
00:08:16,401 --> 00:08:19,031
It will take some time for
us to negotiate with them.

173
00:08:20,831 --> 00:08:22,330
Those darned unions.

174
00:08:22,331 --> 00:08:24,831
I will take care of the union
strike as soon as I can.

175
00:08:26,331 --> 00:08:28,370
What should I do with the
chief of Business Operations?

176
00:08:28,371 --> 00:08:30,700
I will persuade Chief Kim one more time.

177
00:08:30,701 --> 00:08:32,800
He threw his life to save a person,

178
00:08:32,801 --> 00:08:35,700
and he wasn't afraid to
hit the chairman's son.

179
00:08:35,701 --> 00:08:38,430
Will he be easily persuaded by you?

180
00:08:38,431 --> 00:08:41,700
Come to think about it, you hired him.

181
00:08:41,701 --> 00:08:43,670
Yes, I did.

182
00:08:43,671 --> 00:08:47,171
You should have controlled him well.

183
00:08:52,701 --> 00:08:56,471
It's about time someone called. Four.

184
00:08:59,571 --> 00:09:01,541
Two, one.

185
00:09:05,601 --> 00:09:07,630
What a perfect timing.

186
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:10,371
How perfect is this?

187
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,541
Hello?

188
00:09:15,971 --> 00:09:17,001
Yes.

189
00:09:18,371 --> 00:09:19,601
Okay.

190
00:09:23,071 --> 00:09:24,931
Why are you saying no?

191
00:09:26,431 --> 00:09:29,170
It's not something that
a mere chief can do.

192
00:09:29,171 --> 00:09:30,571
What do you want?

193
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:33,700
- Pardon?
- Be honest.

194
00:09:33,701 --> 00:09:36,901
I am not at my own interest here, Chairman.

195
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:39,271
I won't get angry.

196
00:09:39,931 --> 00:09:41,301
Tell me.

197
00:09:42,671 --> 00:09:45,070
With all due respect, may I make a request?

198
00:09:45,071 --> 00:09:47,771
You should have brought it up already!

199
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:54,131
You said you wouldn't get angry.

200
00:09:56,401 --> 00:09:59,571
Yes. I am not angry. Okay.

201
00:10:00,431 --> 00:10:01,971
Speak.

202
00:10:03,671 --> 00:10:05,700
I believe my predecessor,
Lee Eun Seok's wife is...

203
00:10:05,701 --> 00:10:07,801
facing a lawsuit...

204
00:10:08,071 --> 00:10:10,900
about how our investment was foundered.

205
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:13,300
- So what?
- I will do my best...

206
00:10:13,301 --> 00:10:15,601
as a part of the preparation
team, so please...

207
00:10:16,201 --> 00:10:17,700
drop the lawsuit.

208
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:19,601
Is that all you want?

209
00:10:20,731 --> 00:10:22,601
Though it is something small,

210
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,931
I do have one more request.

211
00:10:25,631 --> 00:10:27,201
I will personally...

212
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:31,501
make that request to Director Seo.

213
00:10:36,931 --> 00:10:39,571
Tell Ms. Cho...

214
00:10:39,871 --> 00:10:41,931
to drop the lawsuit.

215
00:10:42,201 --> 00:10:45,371
I never want to hear a word...

216
00:10:45,571 --> 00:10:47,830
about Mr. Lee's wife from this day on.

217
00:10:47,831 --> 00:10:49,631
Yes, Sir.

218
00:10:51,831 --> 00:10:54,900
Mr. Seo, if what he asks isn't too much,

219
00:10:54,901 --> 00:10:56,931
make sure you let him have it.

220
00:10:58,001 --> 00:10:59,001
Yes, Sir.

221
00:11:02,501 --> 00:11:03,831
Thank you, Sir.

222
00:11:04,401 --> 00:11:06,131
I will do my best.

223
00:11:11,601 --> 00:11:13,701
Arrange a DF team...

224
00:11:14,201 --> 00:11:17,071
and prepare for due diligence
starting tomorrow.

225
00:11:17,401 --> 00:11:19,730
Everything about this investment is...

226
00:11:19,731 --> 00:11:21,671
in your hands, Mr. Seo.

227
00:11:24,201 --> 00:11:25,601
Are you insane?

228
00:11:26,671 --> 00:11:28,331
I thought I made myself clear.

229
00:11:28,901 --> 00:11:30,330
You should learn to be afraid.

230
00:11:30,331 --> 00:11:33,201
I've been living as a huge coward.

231
00:11:34,201 --> 00:11:38,771
But I felt so bad for Mr. Lee's wife.

232
00:11:40,001 --> 00:11:41,430
She had to sell her house...

233
00:11:41,431 --> 00:11:43,701
to pay for her husband's hospital fee.

234
00:11:44,171 --> 00:11:46,330
She was in a huge debt, too.

235
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:48,430
My goodness.

236
00:11:48,431 --> 00:11:51,000
Are you her brother or something?

237
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,571
I'm not,

238
00:11:52,971 --> 00:11:56,231
but I just felt so bad for her.

239
00:11:57,871 --> 00:11:59,401
Tell me what your other request is.

240
00:11:59,701 --> 00:12:00,981
I know that's your real request.

241
00:12:01,831 --> 00:12:04,001
Can you destroy...

242
00:12:04,801 --> 00:12:06,700
the books you have?

243
00:12:06,701 --> 00:12:08,771
Destroy what?

244
00:12:09,131 --> 00:12:12,171
My books from Deokpo Enterprise.

245
00:12:20,671 --> 00:12:22,000
If you destroy just that,

246
00:12:22,001 --> 00:12:25,100
I am prepared to do everything for you...

247
00:12:25,101 --> 00:12:28,431
without any burden...

248
00:12:29,301 --> 00:12:31,770
on my heart.

249
00:12:31,771 --> 00:12:33,170
I really mean it.

250
00:12:33,171 --> 00:12:34,531
What if I say no?

251
00:12:36,371 --> 00:12:40,131
If you say no, what can I do? I'm a nobody.

252
00:12:40,471 --> 00:12:43,601
But you are in charge of
this investment case.

253
00:12:45,301 --> 00:12:49,800
I could tell the chairman
was counting on you.

254
00:12:49,801 --> 00:12:52,000
I really hope you succeed.

255
00:12:52,001 --> 00:12:54,700
I mean, 78 million dollars are at stake.

256
00:12:54,701 --> 00:12:56,270
Darn you, idiot.

257
00:12:56,271 --> 00:12:59,671
I am just really worried.

258
00:13:01,201 --> 00:13:03,571
You're hurting my armpits.

259
00:13:08,571 --> 00:13:09,571
Fine.

260
00:13:10,171 --> 00:13:12,071
Let's make this work.

261
00:13:12,431 --> 00:13:14,201
Let's make it work for
both of our benefits.

262
00:13:14,431 --> 00:13:16,301
That's what I wanted, too.

263
00:13:19,701 --> 00:13:22,000
Okay, we'll talk more tomorrow.

264
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:24,770
I have to prepare for the due diligence.

265
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:27,830
I really hope you can
take care of this today.

266
00:13:27,831 --> 00:13:30,901
I can work at my best
when my heart is at rest.

267
00:13:42,101 --> 00:13:44,200
I have never had...

268
00:13:44,201 --> 00:13:46,730
such a crazy day since I
started working here.

269
00:13:46,731 --> 00:13:48,430
Seong Ryong is about to be fired,

270
00:13:48,431 --> 00:13:50,430
Mr. Lee's wife is in a trouble,

271
00:13:50,431 --> 00:13:52,500
and Seoahn Jangryong is talking nonsense.

272
00:13:52,501 --> 00:13:55,971
It's as if I'm watching an
Olympics opening ceremony.

273
00:13:56,071 --> 00:13:57,570
World Cup opening ceremonies are better.

274
00:13:57,571 --> 00:13:58,601
You're right.

275
00:13:59,301 --> 00:14:00,930
Why isn't Seong Ryong coming?

276
00:14:00,931 --> 00:14:03,131
He said he has to stop by somewhere.

277
00:14:03,471 --> 00:14:06,600
You know what? It's really awesome...

278
00:14:06,601 --> 00:14:08,871
they dropped the lawsuit against Mr.
Lee's wife.

279
00:14:09,071 --> 00:14:11,430
If you think about it, Chief is...

280
00:14:11,431 --> 00:14:15,100
very smart in a way. He's like...

281
00:14:15,101 --> 00:14:17,470
- Sherlock.
- Like Brad Pitt?

282
00:14:17,471 --> 00:14:19,770
What do you mean, Brad Pitt?

283
00:14:19,771 --> 00:14:23,270
Chief isn't smart. He's
just good at using tricks.

284
00:14:23,271 --> 00:14:25,100
Come on, at this point,

285
00:14:25,101 --> 00:14:27,870
he does deserve some credit.

286
00:14:27,871 --> 00:14:30,670
Of course. He took care of
the case without spending...

287
00:14:30,671 --> 00:14:33,130
a dine when it could've cost
her thousands of dollars.

288
00:14:33,131 --> 00:14:35,000
- That's amazing.
- And...

289
00:14:35,001 --> 00:14:37,130
he joined the due diligence
preparation team, too.

290
00:14:37,131 --> 00:14:41,030
Shouldn't he be considered
as our department's pride?

291
00:14:41,031 --> 00:14:42,571
He's not our pride.

292
00:14:42,831 --> 00:14:45,130
Chief is a lucky man.

293
00:14:45,131 --> 00:14:47,570
He's not our pride. He's just lucky.

294
00:14:47,571 --> 00:14:49,600
He is our pride.

295
00:14:49,601 --> 00:14:51,900
I mean, has anyone here been...

296
00:14:51,901 --> 00:14:53,600
on the due diligence preparation team?

297
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,370
- I...
- What?

298
00:14:55,371 --> 00:14:57,600
Have never been on one, either.

299
00:14:57,601 --> 00:14:59,370
I've been offered the position once,

300
00:14:59,371 --> 00:15:02,570
but my appendix burst at that time.

301
00:15:02,571 --> 00:15:05,700
Didn't you say it burst
during your promotion exam?

302
00:15:05,701 --> 00:15:06,900
You said that's why you failed.

303
00:15:06,901 --> 00:15:08,670
That's the other appendix.

304
00:15:08,671 --> 00:15:12,030
Do you have two appendices?
These aren't kidneys.

305
00:15:12,031 --> 00:15:13,870
Stop asking questions.

306
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:16,170
It's embarrassing to have two appendices.

307
00:15:16,171 --> 00:15:18,031
It's a very rare case.

308
00:15:21,001 --> 00:15:22,571
- Here, Gi Ok.
- Pardon?

309
00:15:22,901 --> 00:15:24,271
Oh, I'm fine.

310
00:15:24,371 --> 00:15:26,400
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

311
00:15:26,401 --> 00:15:28,930
Gi Ok, what's wrong? Eat up.

312
00:15:28,931 --> 00:15:30,100
No, I'm really fine.

313
00:15:30,101 --> 00:15:32,400
Come on. I was the only one who ate.

314
00:15:32,401 --> 00:15:34,200
You should eat. Why won't you eat?

315
00:15:34,201 --> 00:15:35,500
No, I'm really fine.

316
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:37,130
- That's nonsense.
- Yes, Soo Jin.

317
00:15:37,131 --> 00:15:38,670
There is no way you aren't eating. Eat.

318
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,470
Oh, yes. Okay.

319
00:15:40,471 --> 00:15:41,971
I'm really fine.

320
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:01,101
I just received a message
from our legal team.

321
00:16:03,801 --> 00:16:05,501
The company will...

322
00:16:09,971 --> 00:16:11,271
drop the lawsuit.

323
00:16:13,901 --> 00:16:15,301
Thank you.

324
00:16:15,831 --> 00:16:17,571
Thank you very much.

325
00:16:17,931 --> 00:16:19,701
It's nothing.

326
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:21,630
I was wondering what you were up to.

327
00:16:21,631 --> 00:16:22,970
You had a big picture in your mind.

328
00:16:22,971 --> 00:16:25,400
This is barely a big picture.

329
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,700
It's just a tiny picture frame.

330
00:16:27,701 --> 00:16:28,771
I thought...

331
00:16:29,301 --> 00:16:31,800
the world was crashing down on me.

332
00:16:31,801 --> 00:16:33,230
Tell it to crash down.

333
00:16:33,231 --> 00:16:35,801
We will find a way to escape.

334
00:16:37,471 --> 00:16:40,200
At first, it wasn't comfortable
for me to see you...

335
00:16:40,201 --> 00:16:43,670
because you are my husband's replacement.

336
00:16:43,671 --> 00:16:45,270
But that's not the case anymore.

337
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:47,070
To me and Seung Won,

338
00:16:47,071 --> 00:16:48,670
you are a savior.

339
00:16:48,671 --> 00:16:51,801
I wouldn't say I'm a savior. We are here...

340
00:16:53,331 --> 00:16:55,931
to help each other.

341
00:17:03,631 --> 00:17:05,670
Arrange a DF team...

342
00:17:05,671 --> 00:17:08,771
and prepare for due diligence
starting tomorrow.

343
00:17:09,331 --> 00:17:11,531
Everything about this investment is...

344
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:14,431
in your hands, Mr. Seo.

345
00:17:23,571 --> 00:17:24,601
It's me.

346
00:17:24,971 --> 00:17:28,201
Bring Kim Seong Ryong's books immediately.

347
00:17:33,401 --> 00:17:35,071
I want to thank you, too.

348
00:17:35,401 --> 00:17:37,300
You fought for us,

349
00:17:37,301 --> 00:17:39,530
and you dropped the lawsuit, too.

350
00:17:39,531 --> 00:17:41,500
Don't be thankful.

351
00:17:41,501 --> 00:17:43,240
I only fought because...

352
00:17:43,241 --> 00:17:46,001
I just needed a place
to vent out my stress.

353
00:17:46,201 --> 00:17:48,031
What about the lawsuit?

354
00:17:48,571 --> 00:17:50,131
The lawsuit is...

355
00:17:50,371 --> 00:17:52,970
Did you do that to let off steam?

356
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:54,431
Well, I had many reasons.

357
00:17:56,071 --> 00:17:59,301
Come to think of it, I think
you are a righteous man.

358
00:18:02,001 --> 00:18:04,101
Righteous man!

359
00:18:04,771 --> 00:18:07,241
Mr. Righteous!

360
00:18:07,401 --> 00:18:09,270
- Mr. Righteous!
- Mr. Righteous!

361
00:18:09,271 --> 00:18:10,900
- Can't you hear that?
- Mr. Righteous!

362
00:18:10,901 --> 00:18:12,601
- Mr. Righteous!
- Mr. Righteous!

363
00:18:14,331 --> 00:18:15,870
Please don't call me Mr. Righteous.

364
00:18:15,871 --> 00:18:17,741
I'm sick of hearing that.

365
00:18:20,171 --> 00:18:21,701
Mr. Chair.

366
00:18:22,931 --> 00:18:24,531
- Mr. Medical insurance.
- Stop it.

367
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:27,470
- Mr. Doubt.
- Don't do it.

368
00:18:27,471 --> 00:18:28,571
Mr. Righteous!

369
00:18:29,631 --> 00:18:31,371
Don't call me Mr. Righteous!

370
00:18:33,241 --> 00:18:36,331
What's up with Seoahn Jangryong?

371
00:18:37,031 --> 00:18:39,130
When Chinese people get
stuck on something...

372
00:18:39,131 --> 00:18:41,501
they think is important,
they don't back down.

373
00:18:42,401 --> 00:18:44,307
I think...

374
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:47,830
it'll be a huge problem if
we can't get the investment.

375
00:18:47,831 --> 00:18:50,671
I'd hate to have Director
Seo get all the credit...

376
00:18:51,771 --> 00:18:52,771
though.

377
00:18:53,071 --> 00:18:54,531
Still,

378
00:18:55,031 --> 00:18:56,471
we can't let them be.

379
00:18:56,931 --> 00:18:58,701
We need to find an alternative.

380
00:19:00,901 --> 00:19:02,071
An alternative.

381
00:19:09,471 --> 00:19:11,870
Inhumane working environment!

382
00:19:11,871 --> 00:19:14,930
TQ must awaken!

383
00:19:14,931 --> 00:19:17,000
- Wake up!
- Wake up!

384
00:19:17,001 --> 00:19:20,070
No more irrational charges and penalties!

385
00:19:20,071 --> 00:19:22,930
TQ must reform!

386
00:19:22,931 --> 00:19:24,770
- Reform!
- Reform!

387
00:19:24,771 --> 00:19:26,531
Of course, I ate.

388
00:19:27,101 --> 00:19:29,600
Yes, I brought heat packs.

389
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:32,300
If there's going to be a
conflict, don't go in front.

390
00:19:32,301 --> 00:19:33,870
Stay back.

391
00:19:33,871 --> 00:19:36,330
Okay. Don't worry. Go do your work.

392
00:19:36,331 --> 00:19:38,571
You should take care of yourself.

393
00:19:39,131 --> 00:19:41,171
Don't forget your dinner.

394
00:19:42,071 --> 00:19:43,631
Okay, Father.

395
00:19:50,831 --> 00:19:51,971
Chief!

396
00:19:53,171 --> 00:19:56,971
"Mr. Righteous" is lasting a long time.

397
00:19:57,601 --> 00:20:00,500
People might still call
you that until you're 60.

398
00:20:00,501 --> 00:20:03,331
Gosh, that nickname. I
feel like throwing up.

399
00:20:05,931 --> 00:20:07,740
You can't throw up.

400
00:20:07,741 --> 00:20:11,171
It's like a badge of honor.

401
00:20:11,741 --> 00:20:13,240
After you went to the waiting room,

402
00:20:13,241 --> 00:20:15,631
I couldn't eat anything.

403
00:20:18,671 --> 00:20:21,030
Gosh, that's nasty. What's that smell?

404
00:20:21,031 --> 00:20:22,771
That's meat and kimchi.

405
00:20:23,101 --> 00:20:25,240
You ate too much chicken for lunch,

406
00:20:25,241 --> 00:20:26,870
so you took digestive medicine.

407
00:20:26,871 --> 00:20:28,970
You even had red bean porridge for dessert.

408
00:20:28,971 --> 00:20:30,240
I had that yesterday.

409
00:20:30,241 --> 00:20:31,370
It was around noon today.

410
00:20:31,371 --> 00:20:32,800
Why do you lie?

411
00:20:32,801 --> 00:20:35,400
By the way, after conducting due diligence,

412
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,430
TQ Delivery will be fine, right?

413
00:20:37,431 --> 00:20:38,500
What about TQ Delivery?

414
00:20:38,501 --> 00:20:40,870
Well... A friend of mine works there.

415
00:20:40,871 --> 00:20:42,430
It'll be fine.

416
00:20:42,431 --> 00:20:45,300
They're just checking our integrity.

417
00:20:45,301 --> 00:20:46,470
I see.

418
00:20:46,471 --> 00:20:49,700
You didn't eat lunch. You look down.

419
00:20:49,701 --> 00:20:50,800
Is something wrong?

420
00:20:50,801 --> 00:20:52,100
You didn't eat lunch?

421
00:20:52,101 --> 00:20:53,631
It's nothing.

422
00:20:55,801 --> 00:20:56,970
Hello.

423
00:20:56,971 --> 00:20:58,301
How can I help you?

424
00:20:58,471 --> 00:21:00,271
I'm from General Affairs Department.

425
00:21:00,471 --> 00:21:04,130
I heard Chief Kim is preparing
for the due diligence.

426
00:21:04,131 --> 00:21:06,570
- He's here.
- That's me.

427
00:21:06,571 --> 00:21:09,000
I'm sorry, but please
check the attendance...

428
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:11,100
and remaining vacation day data.

429
00:21:11,101 --> 00:21:13,200
My department has so many errors,

430
00:21:13,201 --> 00:21:14,530
so please check them.

431
00:21:14,531 --> 00:21:15,800
I'm only one person.

432
00:21:15,801 --> 00:21:17,370
How can I check all that?

433
00:21:17,371 --> 00:21:20,771
It's an order from upstairs.

434
00:21:22,071 --> 00:21:23,471
I'll go with him.

435
00:21:24,031 --> 00:21:25,700
Thank you.

436
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,631
- I can go, right?
- She can go, right?

437
00:21:28,101 --> 00:21:30,307
Don't talk to me like that.

438
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:31,871
Go ahead.

439
00:21:33,631 --> 00:21:37,201
They always ask things when we're busy.

440
00:21:41,371 --> 00:21:43,870
I checked your wife's call history.

441
00:21:43,871 --> 00:21:45,700
I didn't find anyone unusual.

442
00:21:45,701 --> 00:21:48,770
She could be using two phones.

443
00:21:48,771 --> 00:21:50,730
I checked where she's been since yesterday.

444
00:21:50,731 --> 00:21:53,101
Nothing unusual there, either.

445
00:21:53,571 --> 00:21:56,600
My wife is much more thorough...

446
00:21:56,601 --> 00:21:59,471
and clever than you think.

447
00:22:00,371 --> 00:22:02,631
She must have planted someone.

448
00:22:04,501 --> 00:22:07,971
So you better dig deeper.

449
00:22:08,501 --> 00:22:10,831
Yes, Sir.

450
00:22:11,931 --> 00:22:14,830
Assistant Manager Kang,
Chief Kim, and I will be...

451
00:22:14,831 --> 00:22:16,730
in the DF team.

452
00:22:16,731 --> 00:22:17,831
Good.

453
00:22:18,101 --> 00:22:20,530
It's a simple job. We
don't need a big team.

454
00:22:20,531 --> 00:22:23,700
Also, Assistant Manager
Yoon will be in the team.

455
00:22:23,701 --> 00:22:25,470
Who put her in the team?

456
00:22:25,471 --> 00:22:27,430
The General Affairs Department asked for...

457
00:22:27,431 --> 00:22:30,270
attendance and vacation day data check.

458
00:22:30,271 --> 00:22:32,801
Chief Kim can't do it
alone, so she'll help out.

459
00:22:35,201 --> 00:22:36,431
Should I exclude her?

460
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:39,271
No, keep her in the team.

461
00:22:42,471 --> 00:22:44,801
Did you bring it?

462
00:23:11,201 --> 00:23:12,201
(Deokpo Enterprise)

463
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:19,801
Are you happy?

464
00:23:21,831 --> 00:23:22,901
Director.

465
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:24,630
This isn't all of them.

466
00:23:24,631 --> 00:23:25,831
I only brought half.

467
00:23:26,871 --> 00:23:28,070
Why did you bring only half?

468
00:23:28,071 --> 00:23:29,770
Don't you know the basic rule?

469
00:23:29,771 --> 00:23:32,430
You'll get the rest when the deal is done.

470
00:23:32,431 --> 00:23:34,370
Can't you pay all up front...

471
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:36,570
like how you pay the toll fee up front?

472
00:23:36,571 --> 00:23:38,100
- Forget it then.
- No.

473
00:23:38,101 --> 00:23:39,301
All right.

474
00:23:39,631 --> 00:23:43,100
As long as you keep your promise, I'm good.

475
00:23:43,101 --> 00:23:44,600
I'll keep my promise.

476
00:23:44,601 --> 00:23:46,131
I'm sure you will.

477
00:23:46,671 --> 00:23:49,571
Let me take a moment to say goodbye.

478
00:24:03,371 --> 00:24:04,431
Director.

479
00:24:05,531 --> 00:24:08,371
I'm asking you...

480
00:24:08,831 --> 00:24:11,071
just to be sure.

481
00:24:12,371 --> 00:24:15,030
You didn't make copies, did you?

482
00:24:15,031 --> 00:24:16,031
What?

483
00:24:17,531 --> 00:24:21,300
Well, only the jerks of the jerks...

484
00:24:21,301 --> 00:24:25,000
who's nasty, shameless, deceitful,

485
00:24:25,001 --> 00:24:28,200
dirty, and cheap would do such a thing.

486
00:24:28,201 --> 00:24:29,201
Right?

487
00:24:30,171 --> 00:24:32,231
Gosh. Wait.

488
00:24:42,031 --> 00:24:43,171
Don't get me wrong.

489
00:24:43,771 --> 00:24:46,071
I forgot to give this to you.

490
00:24:46,971 --> 00:24:49,330
Get you wrong? No.

491
00:24:49,331 --> 00:24:50,871
I respect you.

492
00:24:51,731 --> 00:24:53,271
- I'm leaving.
- Sir.

493
00:24:55,171 --> 00:24:57,701
After I finish the work,
give me the other half.

494
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,871
Do your work right first.

495
00:25:09,531 --> 00:25:10,971
There it goes.

496
00:25:12,101 --> 00:25:13,531
It's going.

497
00:25:14,371 --> 00:25:16,431
It's gone!

498
00:25:20,701 --> 00:25:22,700
At least I got half of it.

499
00:25:22,701 --> 00:25:24,701
After the work, I'll be free.

500
00:25:29,871 --> 00:25:31,947
Where is this pub?

501
00:25:31,971 --> 00:25:33,871
How much are the drinks here?

502
00:25:45,431 --> 00:25:46,431
"Don't get me wrong."

503
00:25:46,432 --> 00:25:48,931
"I forgot to give this to you."

504
00:25:54,371 --> 00:25:56,801
Seo Yul is so cute.

505
00:25:58,231 --> 00:26:01,701
How dare he lie to me?

506
00:26:08,471 --> 00:26:10,201
What about dropping the lawsuit?

507
00:26:10,971 --> 00:26:13,301
Did you do that to let off steam?

508
00:26:15,401 --> 00:26:18,401
I couldn't answer her right away.

509
00:26:22,201 --> 00:26:24,647
Was dropping the lawsuit
your first priority...

510
00:26:24,671 --> 00:26:28,070
or was getting the books?

511
00:26:28,071 --> 00:26:29,230
Dropping the lawsuit.

512
00:26:29,231 --> 00:26:32,501
What? That's weird.

513
00:26:33,101 --> 00:26:35,370
It's weird, right?

514
00:26:35,371 --> 00:26:37,370
I don't help people. You know that.

515
00:26:37,371 --> 00:26:40,901
Of course you don't. You're
like a poisonous snake.

516
00:26:41,271 --> 00:26:43,800
I'm like a cobra.

517
00:26:43,801 --> 00:26:47,101
Maybe you're really becoming...

518
00:26:47,601 --> 00:26:49,100
a righteous man.

519
00:26:49,101 --> 00:26:52,400
That's nonsense.

520
00:26:52,401 --> 00:26:54,830
Look what you've been doing.

521
00:26:54,831 --> 00:26:57,531
You've been punishing bad guys.

522
00:26:58,171 --> 00:26:59,401
You're so cool.

523
00:26:59,571 --> 00:27:03,030
It's because they were
doing really mean things.

524
00:27:03,031 --> 00:27:07,301
A righteous man gets angry
at injustice, Chief.

525
00:27:08,271 --> 00:27:11,070
My knee. My leg.

526
00:27:11,071 --> 00:27:13,600
Gwang Sook, don't call me a righteous man.

527
00:27:13,601 --> 00:27:14,900
Do you want to ruin my life?

528
00:27:14,901 --> 00:27:18,230
Chief. Think about it.

529
00:27:18,231 --> 00:27:20,800
Do you want to put on a mask,

530
00:27:20,801 --> 00:27:22,600
wear a cape,

531
00:27:22,601 --> 00:27:24,101
or do you want to wear...

532
00:27:25,631 --> 00:27:27,601
underwear over tights?

533
00:27:27,701 --> 00:27:29,831
Gosh, I'm picturing you in tights!

534
00:27:30,201 --> 00:27:31,201
Goodness.

535
00:27:31,202 --> 00:27:33,101
I'm hanging up. Good night.

536
00:27:34,131 --> 00:27:35,671
That's nonsense.

537
00:27:42,901 --> 00:27:45,401
Be quiet!

538
00:28:01,301 --> 00:28:03,971
Is this true?

539
00:28:07,671 --> 00:28:08,671
Yes.

540
00:28:08,871 --> 00:28:11,670
Mr. Kim requested them
to drop the lawsuit...

541
00:28:11,671 --> 00:28:13,701
in exchange for him to join the DF team.

542
00:28:14,971 --> 00:28:16,100
What should I make of this?

543
00:28:16,101 --> 00:28:18,470
It looks like there is
no problem with them...

544
00:28:18,471 --> 00:28:20,500
preparing for due diligence of TQ Delivery.

545
00:28:20,501 --> 00:28:22,701
If it wasn't for this incident,

546
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:25,331
they would've begun the
accounting fraud already.

547
00:28:25,431 --> 00:28:27,831
It was the perfect moment
to catch an evidence.

548
00:28:28,871 --> 00:28:33,230
However, Mr. Kim has been
showing a different side...

549
00:28:33,231 --> 00:28:36,400
compared to the information I had.

550
00:28:36,401 --> 00:28:40,371
He would reject unacceptable
expense reports,

551
00:28:40,671 --> 00:28:44,031
and he beat up the chairman's son, too.

552
00:28:44,231 --> 00:28:47,701
He is putting on some kind of a show.

553
00:28:49,371 --> 00:28:51,000
I don't think so.

554
00:28:51,001 --> 00:28:53,401
It seemed too real...

555
00:28:53,631 --> 00:28:55,600
for it to be a show.

556
00:28:55,601 --> 00:28:57,231
Too real?

557
00:28:58,031 --> 00:29:00,031
My goodness!

558
00:29:00,301 --> 00:29:02,830
- I'm sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

559
00:29:02,831 --> 00:29:06,571
I will continue to keep my eyes on him.

560
00:29:06,901 --> 00:29:08,801
- Goodbye.
- Hey!

561
00:29:12,801 --> 00:29:15,571
So Mr. Kim had a go with Myung Seok.

562
00:29:15,831 --> 00:29:19,371
Yes. He was almost fired for that.

563
00:29:19,571 --> 00:29:23,807
Myung Seok probably never
faced anything like it.

564
00:29:23,831 --> 00:29:27,131
At this point, I'm confused about Mr.
Kim, too.

565
00:29:27,871 --> 00:29:30,900
He's been doing the things we couldn't do.

566
00:29:30,901 --> 00:29:33,370
I'm sure Mr. Seo hired him...

567
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:35,500
to use him like his puppet.

568
00:29:35,501 --> 00:29:37,400
But I still haven't caught...

569
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:39,601
Mr. Seo using him in any way.

570
00:29:41,171 --> 00:29:43,601
Do you think I'm mistaken?

571
00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:03,171
Let me sleep! Okay? Darn it.

572
00:30:04,671 --> 00:30:07,001
Oh my goodness.

573
00:30:08,201 --> 00:30:09,301
Okay.

574
00:30:09,701 --> 00:30:10,830
Seong Ryong, get a grip...

575
00:30:10,831 --> 00:30:13,230
and live like your old cold-blooded self.

576
00:30:13,231 --> 00:30:16,831
Do not get shaken.

577
00:30:17,431 --> 00:30:20,871
Do not be shaken.

578
00:30:21,601 --> 00:30:22,671
Do not...

579
00:30:23,501 --> 00:30:26,171
What is this? What?

580
00:30:27,301 --> 00:30:29,700
What's going on?

581
00:30:29,701 --> 00:30:31,300
What is this?

582
00:30:31,301 --> 00:30:33,401
What's happening?

583
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:03,701
What do you mean, you need more money?

584
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:07,400
It's already hard enough
to pay for the tuition,

585
00:31:07,401 --> 00:31:08,930
rent, and living expenses.

586
00:31:08,931 --> 00:31:11,401
And now you want lesson fees?

587
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:14,970
No, I'm not frustrated.

588
00:31:14,971 --> 00:31:16,571
It's because I woke up from my sleep.

589
00:31:16,971 --> 00:31:18,831
It's pretty late here.

590
00:31:20,431 --> 00:31:22,031
Okay, then.

591
00:31:22,371 --> 00:31:25,271
Oh, will you come home
during your vacation?

592
00:31:26,031 --> 00:31:30,001
Spending money on airfare isn't a waste.

593
00:31:30,971 --> 00:31:32,900
If you won't come during the vacation,

594
00:31:32,901 --> 00:31:34,801
when can you come?

595
00:31:35,571 --> 00:31:37,630
I mean, we should live like a family.

596
00:31:37,631 --> 00:31:39,471
What is this?

597
00:31:41,201 --> 00:31:42,601
Okay.

598
00:31:43,631 --> 00:31:45,700
And tell Ha Rin to call.

599
00:31:45,701 --> 00:31:48,131
How can she never call me?

600
00:31:51,271 --> 00:31:53,931
Okay, then. Goodbye.

601
00:31:58,031 --> 00:32:01,371
My gosh. I'm losing money again.

602
00:32:02,201 --> 00:32:03,700
Goodness.

603
00:32:03,701 --> 00:32:06,671
How did I make a living
before my promotion?

604
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:17,671
Okay.

605
00:32:18,771 --> 00:32:21,101
Let's go to sleep.

606
00:32:30,831 --> 00:32:32,971
Whatever.

607
00:32:37,701 --> 00:32:40,471
(Chief Kim)

608
00:32:43,771 --> 00:32:45,901
Why is rent so expensive?

609
00:32:46,571 --> 00:32:48,131
Where can I go?

610
00:32:48,671 --> 00:32:50,171
I can't live anywhere in...

611
00:32:51,771 --> 00:32:54,030
My gosh, this world just won't let me be.

612
00:32:54,031 --> 00:32:55,971
Will you look at where... What?

613
00:32:58,031 --> 00:33:00,331
Why are you so surprised?

614
00:33:02,131 --> 00:33:04,630
My gosh, you smell like alcohol.

615
00:33:04,631 --> 00:33:06,131
Did you drink a lot yesterday?

616
00:33:09,031 --> 00:33:10,270
How is your arm?

617
00:33:10,271 --> 00:33:11,930
I'm fine, really.

618
00:33:11,931 --> 00:33:14,431
No, you're not okay.

619
00:33:14,671 --> 00:33:16,900
You should've been more demanding...

620
00:33:16,901 --> 00:33:19,271
to your father about firing me.

621
00:33:19,771 --> 00:33:21,170
I decided to let this pass.

622
00:33:21,171 --> 00:33:22,671
Let what pass?

623
00:33:23,231 --> 00:33:25,271
Guard. Guard? Guard.

624
00:33:25,501 --> 00:33:27,371
Mr. Go.

625
00:33:27,871 --> 00:33:30,701
You should know your enemy
before you pick a fight.

626
00:33:33,901 --> 00:33:36,270
Let's not greet each other anymore.

627
00:33:36,271 --> 00:33:38,130
I won't say anything even if you ignore me.

628
00:33:38,131 --> 00:33:39,501
Greetings?

629
00:33:44,171 --> 00:33:46,501
My goodness, Kid.

630
00:33:46,601 --> 00:33:49,401
There was no use in pulling that kid's arm.

631
00:33:50,931 --> 00:33:54,271
Yes. Yes. I'd like to
take a look at the room.

632
00:33:54,671 --> 00:33:56,231
I'll see you on Saturday.

633
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:57,631
Hello?

634
00:33:58,231 --> 00:33:59,671
Is the ceiling solid?

635
00:34:00,731 --> 00:34:02,001
Yes, okay.

636
00:34:03,831 --> 00:34:05,900
This is 20,000 deposit with 1,200 for rent.

637
00:34:05,901 --> 00:34:08,061
This one is 20,000 deposit
with 1,000 as monthly rent.

638
00:34:09,771 --> 00:34:12,070
You should live in this 1,800
deposit and 1,800 rent.

639
00:34:12,071 --> 00:34:14,201
Who could live in this mess?

640
00:34:15,771 --> 00:34:16,931
Are you moving?

641
00:34:17,071 --> 00:34:18,331
You startled me.

642
00:34:22,031 --> 00:34:25,401
Oh, yes. I can't live there anymore.

643
00:34:25,901 --> 00:34:28,470
You wouldn't believe it,
but the ceiling fell down.

644
00:34:28,471 --> 00:34:29,831
How can this be?

645
00:34:29,931 --> 00:34:31,830
What kind of a house is that?

646
00:34:31,831 --> 00:34:33,500
Wasn't the water supply
cut off the last time?

647
00:34:33,501 --> 00:34:35,401
Exactly.

648
00:34:35,771 --> 00:34:38,431
I'm looking for a place around work,

649
00:34:38,571 --> 00:34:41,071
but everything is just too expensive.

650
00:34:42,931 --> 00:34:45,701
While we're on the subject, Seong Ryong.

651
00:34:46,531 --> 00:34:49,570
Just hear me out first without any burdens.

652
00:34:49,571 --> 00:34:50,800
Yes, I'm listening.

653
00:34:50,801 --> 00:34:55,471
I have an empty room in my apartment.

654
00:34:56,831 --> 00:34:59,470
- So what?
- Well.

655
00:34:59,471 --> 00:35:01,900
The rest of my family lives abroad.

656
00:35:01,901 --> 00:35:04,100
My wife and daughter are in Canada.

657
00:35:04,101 --> 00:35:06,601
That's why you looked like a beggar...

658
00:35:06,971 --> 00:35:09,747
I mean, you always looked tired.

659
00:35:09,771 --> 00:35:11,870
I guess sometimes...

660
00:35:11,871 --> 00:35:14,231
I do look like a beggar.

661
00:35:14,731 --> 00:35:17,001
It's okay. I don't mind.

662
00:35:17,731 --> 00:35:19,231
So, anyway.

663
00:35:19,971 --> 00:35:22,200
Why don't you pay me the monthly rent...

664
00:35:22,201 --> 00:35:23,830
and come live with me?

665
00:35:23,831 --> 00:35:27,200
I don't think that's right.
Even if I do pay,

666
00:35:27,201 --> 00:35:29,100
I don't want to be a burden.

667
00:35:29,101 --> 00:35:31,800
What are you talking about?
It's not a burden.

668
00:35:31,801 --> 00:35:34,801
It's not like we're strangers.

669
00:35:35,931 --> 00:35:37,730
But still, it's weird.

670
00:35:37,731 --> 00:35:41,470
Feel free to come and live with me.

671
00:35:41,471 --> 00:35:43,140
Think of it as your own home.

672
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,870
You don't have to be burdened.

673
00:35:45,871 --> 00:35:47,271
How is 450 dollars per month?

674
00:35:48,731 --> 00:35:50,641
- What?
- Take off 50.

675
00:35:53,471 --> 00:35:57,270
No, this is pretty much
like a charity work.

676
00:35:57,271 --> 00:35:58,471
Take 50 off.

677
00:36:01,171 --> 00:36:02,330
Let's call it off.

678
00:36:02,331 --> 00:36:05,831
I'd rather not do something
that'll be a burden to us.

679
00:36:07,641 --> 00:36:08,641
What a cheap guy.

680
00:36:08,642 --> 00:36:10,430
Did you think I am cheap?

681
00:36:10,431 --> 00:36:13,471
No, you are a smart man, Seong Ryong.

682
00:36:14,141 --> 00:36:16,100
- He has good ears.
- Do I have good ears?

683
00:36:16,101 --> 00:36:18,200
Stop bickering with him,
and let's get ready.

684
00:36:18,201 --> 00:36:19,831
Yes. Let's go.

685
00:36:22,401 --> 00:36:25,801
Financial materials are already
here, so just check it.

686
00:36:26,071 --> 00:36:29,330
We need reasons for our
deficit, how we'll overcome it.

687
00:36:29,331 --> 00:36:33,331
What Seoahn Jangryong wants
is an honest analysis.

688
00:36:34,641 --> 00:36:36,801
I guess that's nothing to worry about.

689
00:36:37,271 --> 00:36:39,931
We have Mr. Righteous with us.

690
00:36:42,831 --> 00:36:45,571
This is an easy task. Let's
finish it within the day.

691
00:36:47,141 --> 00:36:48,171
Let's go.

692
00:36:54,471 --> 00:36:55,731
Don't you have a bag?

693
00:37:23,371 --> 00:37:25,430
- Reform!
- Reform!

694
00:37:25,431 --> 00:37:27,600
Delivery men are human, too.

695
00:37:27,601 --> 00:37:30,830
No more penalties!

696
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:33,030
- No more!
- No more!

697
00:37:33,031 --> 00:37:35,900
Inhumane working environment!
TQ must awaken!

698
00:37:35,901 --> 00:37:37,270
I don't see any police forces.

699
00:37:37,271 --> 00:37:40,671
We'll report them when things get violent.

700
00:37:41,001 --> 00:37:43,670
No more irrational charges and penalties!

701
00:37:43,671 --> 00:37:46,730
TQ must reform!

702
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:48,830
Inhumane working environment!

703
00:37:48,831 --> 00:37:50,830
TQ must awaken!

704
00:37:50,831 --> 00:37:52,900
I think I've seen that guy before.

705
00:37:52,901 --> 00:37:54,331
- Wake up!
- Wake up!

706
00:37:54,431 --> 00:37:56,231
No more irrational charges and penalties!

707
00:37:57,141 --> 00:38:00,400
Sir, they want you to
revise the penalty policy.

708
00:38:00,401 --> 00:38:01,571
What is that?

709
00:38:01,731 --> 00:38:04,670
When a courier misplaces
or damages a parcel...

710
00:38:04,671 --> 00:38:06,641
Look it up yourself.

711
00:38:08,171 --> 00:38:11,000
TQ Delivery fees are often
mentioned on the news.

712
00:38:11,001 --> 00:38:12,471
How do you plan to...

713
00:38:16,641 --> 00:38:19,000
Why is everyone else wearing black...

714
00:38:19,001 --> 00:38:20,771
- when one person...
- Chief Kim!

715
00:38:22,371 --> 00:38:24,140
- Come here.
- The guy in red.

716
00:38:24,141 --> 00:38:26,071
- Is he head of the union?
- Be quiet.

717
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:30,641
Ha Gyeong.

718
00:38:31,071 --> 00:38:33,371
Is the man in red the
head of the labor union?

719
00:38:35,471 --> 00:38:37,100
We'll go ahead and set things up.

720
00:38:37,101 --> 00:38:38,101
Okay.

721
00:38:44,501 --> 00:38:46,200
The Seoahn Jangryong people
will be here tomorrow.

722
00:38:46,201 --> 00:38:48,070
Why are the protesters still there?

723
00:38:48,071 --> 00:38:49,570
I want it to end as well,

724
00:38:49,571 --> 00:38:50,970
but the negotiations are going nowhere.

725
00:38:50,971 --> 00:38:52,870
You should've taken charge from the start.

726
00:38:52,871 --> 00:38:56,071
Don't you know you lose the
upper-hand if you can't?

727
00:38:57,801 --> 00:39:00,170
- End negotiations immediately.
- Pardon?

728
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,200
I'm in charge of this from here on.

729
00:39:02,201 --> 00:39:04,971
Whatever happens now is
none of your business.

730
00:39:08,771 --> 00:39:11,101
(Final Accounts)

731
00:39:20,501 --> 00:39:22,830
Check the accounts of each sales office...

732
00:39:22,831 --> 00:39:24,301
then view the financial statements.

733
00:39:24,401 --> 00:39:27,271
Write up a report based on your findings.

734
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:31,141
(Final Accounts)

735
00:40:18,141 --> 00:40:20,371
Can't they have given us a nicer PC?

736
00:40:21,071 --> 00:40:22,731
Even the power button's stuck.

737
00:40:24,831 --> 00:40:25,871
What's wrong?

738
00:40:32,871 --> 00:40:34,471
What are all these plugs?

739
00:40:42,831 --> 00:40:43,871
What happened?

740
00:40:47,801 --> 00:40:48,801
What's wrong?

741
00:40:55,231 --> 00:40:58,171
Who doesn't mark which plug is for what?

742
00:41:00,471 --> 00:41:01,501
Get out.

743
00:41:01,831 --> 00:41:04,031
- Where to?
- Anywhere but here!

744
00:41:04,601 --> 00:41:07,300
I'm here as a member of the team.

745
00:41:07,301 --> 00:41:09,171
- I...
- Shut your mouth and get out!

746
00:41:15,401 --> 00:41:16,677
I'll be outside.

747
00:41:16,701 --> 00:41:17,831
Call when you're done.

748
00:41:18,231 --> 00:41:19,871
Director.

749
00:41:20,371 --> 00:41:22,641
I can't do all this work alone.

750
00:41:23,571 --> 00:41:24,571
Get out.

751
00:41:25,171 --> 00:41:28,331
Go. Now. Run.

752
00:41:39,201 --> 00:41:41,071
What a horrid temper.

753
00:41:42,401 --> 00:41:44,200
Did I do something that terrible?

754
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:45,800
Did I pull the plug...

755
00:41:45,801 --> 00:41:47,831
when he was fighting the final boss?

756
00:41:51,931 --> 00:41:53,501
(Unite and fight)

757
00:42:02,071 --> 00:42:03,271
Are you...

758
00:42:03,971 --> 00:42:04,971
Hey.

759
00:42:06,101 --> 00:42:07,300
Aren't you Chief Kim?

760
00:42:07,301 --> 00:42:10,300
Aren't you Joon Kwon from
Flower Wagon in Gunsan?

761
00:42:10,301 --> 00:42:12,200
That's me. I'm Joon Kwon.

762
00:42:12,201 --> 00:42:13,670
We meet again.

763
00:42:13,671 --> 00:42:17,100
It's great to see you after so long.

764
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:18,430
What are you doing here?

765
00:42:18,431 --> 00:42:19,971
It's been so long!

766
00:42:21,601 --> 00:42:23,400
(Work environment and charges!)

767
00:42:23,401 --> 00:42:25,000
(TQ is killing its employees!)

768
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:29,070
Seeing you again is
bringing back old memories.

769
00:42:29,071 --> 00:42:31,770
You used to give all us waiters...

770
00:42:31,771 --> 00:42:33,871
some extra pocket money.

771
00:42:34,271 --> 00:42:37,431
Because I knew how much
your boss bugged you.

772
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:40,500
I see you got promoted.

773
00:42:40,501 --> 00:42:41,930
You're head of the union.

774
00:42:41,931 --> 00:42:44,470
Goodness, no. It's no promotion.

775
00:42:44,471 --> 00:42:47,800
The head of any labor union's
a great job in Gunsan.

776
00:42:47,801 --> 00:42:51,201
It's different here. I don't
have that much power.

777
00:42:51,501 --> 00:42:55,070
Do you remember the head of
the port transport union?

778
00:42:55,071 --> 00:42:56,230
His name was Ja Bok.

779
00:42:56,231 --> 00:42:58,900
Everyone in Gunsan knew him.

780
00:42:58,901 --> 00:43:01,701
I thought he was so cool.

781
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:05,000
I asked if I could wear his uniform,

782
00:43:05,001 --> 00:43:06,401
and he slapped me.

783
00:43:08,871 --> 00:43:11,800
Your jacket looks really cool.

784
00:43:11,801 --> 00:43:13,807
Is it a luxury brand?

785
00:43:13,831 --> 00:43:15,830
It's lined with plaid.

786
00:43:15,831 --> 00:43:18,270
Why do I like things like this?

787
00:43:18,271 --> 00:43:19,471
Do you want to try it on?

788
00:43:21,301 --> 00:43:23,330
- No.
- Try it on.

789
00:43:23,331 --> 00:43:24,331
No.

790
00:43:24,332 --> 00:43:26,731
Come on, try it on.

791
00:43:31,431 --> 00:43:32,731
This is how it feels.

792
00:43:33,501 --> 00:43:34,831
I suddenly feel so powerful.

793
00:43:35,031 --> 00:43:38,901
People and honor

794
00:43:39,031 --> 00:43:43,731
Even no names are left behind

795
00:43:44,531 --> 00:43:47,071
You haven't changed one bit.

796
00:43:48,301 --> 00:43:51,531
People and honor

797
00:44:09,331 --> 00:44:10,371
Gi Ok.

798
00:44:10,531 --> 00:44:11,731
Yes, Sir.

799
00:44:11,831 --> 00:44:13,830
Are you watching porn?

800
00:44:13,831 --> 00:44:16,031
No, I'm not.

801
00:44:17,101 --> 00:44:20,000
What's wrong? You've been
weird since yesterday.

802
00:44:20,001 --> 00:44:21,871
Nothing's wrong, Sir.

803
00:44:23,701 --> 00:44:26,300
I didn't mean to eavesdrop,

804
00:44:26,301 --> 00:44:28,607
but I heard you talk on the phone.

805
00:44:28,631 --> 00:44:30,531
Is your family having a tough time?

806
00:44:32,971 --> 00:44:35,401
You don't have to tell
me if you don't want to.

807
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:37,831
I won't be of any help anyway.

808
00:44:38,431 --> 00:44:39,871
No, Sir, it's...

809
00:44:40,401 --> 00:44:43,771
I'm your boss, but I can't
do anything to show for it.

810
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:48,331
The thing is...

811
00:44:50,631 --> 00:44:52,201
It's about my father.

812
00:44:54,401 --> 00:44:56,170
He works at TQ Delivery.

813
00:44:56,171 --> 00:44:58,771
Does he? What about it?

814
00:45:16,401 --> 00:45:19,001
They've been in the red since 2013. Why?

815
00:45:19,301 --> 00:45:22,130
I think it's because
they increased the fees.

816
00:45:22,131 --> 00:45:24,570
Despite that, they maintained
the shipping costs...

817
00:45:24,571 --> 00:45:26,670
without re-negotiating with
large business clients.

818
00:45:26,671 --> 00:45:28,200
The shopping malls refused.

819
00:45:28,201 --> 00:45:30,530
The couriers are demanding
we raise their fees.

820
00:45:30,531 --> 00:45:32,800
If we do, the company will go belly-up.

821
00:45:32,801 --> 00:45:34,400
Why are they so selfish?

822
00:45:34,401 --> 00:45:37,101
I don't think it's just
because of the fees.

823
00:45:37,601 --> 00:45:40,100
We only increased their fees by 12 cents...

824
00:45:40,101 --> 00:45:41,770
since 2013.

825
00:45:41,771 --> 00:45:44,000
In 2014, we stopped covering...

826
00:45:44,001 --> 00:45:46,671
their cell phone bills and gas expense.

827
00:45:47,801 --> 00:45:49,600
The increase in fees...

828
00:45:49,601 --> 00:45:51,971
is much smaller than the
reduction of costs.

829
00:45:52,301 --> 00:45:53,970
If they're still in the red...

830
00:45:53,971 --> 00:45:55,777
Shouldn't you be working on something else?

831
00:45:55,801 --> 00:45:57,071
Why are you on this?

832
00:45:59,401 --> 00:46:01,170
I just had a look.

833
00:46:01,171 --> 00:46:03,171
Don't. Stick to what you're told to.

834
00:46:04,431 --> 00:46:07,330
Put the fee increase as the
main cause of profit loss.

835
00:46:07,331 --> 00:46:08,331
Yes, Sir.

836
00:46:12,801 --> 00:46:14,531
(Unite and fight)

837
00:46:15,031 --> 00:46:17,930
They blame the company's loss on our fees.

838
00:46:17,931 --> 00:46:19,800
That their operations are spotless.

839
00:46:19,801 --> 00:46:23,431
No entrepreneur in Korea would
admit their wrongdoing.

840
00:46:23,671 --> 00:46:26,231
What works is all down to their strategy.

841
00:46:26,401 --> 00:46:27,800
What doesn't is the employees' fault.

842
00:46:27,801 --> 00:46:30,570
Phone bills, gas, compensation
for losses and damages.

843
00:46:30,571 --> 00:46:32,200
We have to pay for all that.

844
00:46:32,201 --> 00:46:35,730
We work 14 hours a day
and make almost nothing.

845
00:46:35,731 --> 00:46:37,870
- 14 hours?
- During peak season,

846
00:46:37,871 --> 00:46:40,071
we even work 18 hours a day.

847
00:46:40,671 --> 00:46:43,370
You must get sick or
injured working that long.

848
00:46:43,371 --> 00:46:44,970
It's physically draining.

849
00:46:44,971 --> 00:46:47,271
They need to try doing what we do.

850
00:46:47,701 --> 00:46:51,801
Only then will they see how absurd this is.

851
00:47:05,631 --> 00:47:06,701
What?

852
00:47:12,271 --> 00:47:13,401
Just a moment.

853
00:47:29,271 --> 00:47:30,671
What do you mean?

854
00:47:31,731 --> 00:47:32,771
What?

855
00:47:36,301 --> 00:47:37,500
Where are you?

856
00:47:37,501 --> 00:47:39,331
Come and tell me face-to-face.

857
00:47:39,801 --> 00:47:43,130
Our lives are almost not worth living.

858
00:47:43,131 --> 00:47:45,000
We're practically delivering machines.

859
00:47:45,001 --> 00:47:47,800
During peak seasons, we
have no time to pee.

860
00:47:47,801 --> 00:47:49,430
Some end up with bladder infections.

861
00:47:49,431 --> 00:47:52,700
Cystitis can be really painful.

862
00:47:52,701 --> 00:47:56,070
Machines get oiled and tweaked.

863
00:47:56,071 --> 00:47:57,230
Even working cattle...

864
00:47:57,231 --> 00:47:58,470
rest at night...

865
00:47:58,471 --> 00:48:00,470
and get to see a vet when they're sick.

866
00:48:00,471 --> 00:48:02,300
We're human beings,

867
00:48:02,301 --> 00:48:04,700
but we get nothing, nothing at all.

868
00:48:04,701 --> 00:48:06,500
The worst days for us...

869
00:48:06,501 --> 00:48:08,901
are Children's Day and Christmas.

870
00:48:09,131 --> 00:48:12,671
We deliver expensive dolls
and robots all day...

871
00:48:13,571 --> 00:48:15,101
and then go home.

872
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:18,571
We can't afford to buy a toy at all.

873
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:21,831
We're practically penniless.

874
00:48:24,901 --> 00:48:25,931
My daughter...

875
00:48:26,931 --> 00:48:28,901
waits at home for her present.

876
00:48:30,071 --> 00:48:33,370
How could the rich businessmen
treat us like this?

877
00:48:33,371 --> 00:48:35,600
We couriers are employees, too.

878
00:48:35,601 --> 00:48:38,771
Why don't they care about us one bit?

879
00:48:40,331 --> 00:48:42,970
It's not just the couriers
they don't care about.

880
00:48:42,971 --> 00:48:46,271
They don't care about human beings, period.

881
00:48:52,671 --> 00:48:53,971
Let's take a break.

882
00:49:04,771 --> 00:49:07,431
Where is he? Why isn't he back yet?

883
00:49:07,601 --> 00:49:09,471
Why don't they care?

884
00:49:17,401 --> 00:49:18,931
It's hard, I know.

885
00:49:21,231 --> 00:49:23,031
Unbelievable.

886
00:49:27,331 --> 00:49:29,031
What are you doing here?

887
00:49:29,531 --> 00:49:30,531
Have a seat.

888
00:49:30,871 --> 00:49:33,401
- Take a seat.
- Sure, thanks.

889
00:49:34,201 --> 00:49:35,401
Hello.

890
00:49:41,471 --> 00:49:43,131
You look like a fisherman.

891
00:49:43,971 --> 00:49:45,231
I do not.

892
00:49:46,571 --> 00:49:49,400
I might make a labor union
in the headquarters.

893
00:49:49,401 --> 00:49:50,831
I could lead it.

894
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:52,570
Over 10 people...

895
00:49:52,571 --> 00:49:54,930
lost their jobs trying to do just that.

896
00:49:54,931 --> 00:49:58,130
Just say the word "union" and
the Evil Witch lists you.

897
00:49:58,131 --> 00:50:00,631
- There's a list?
- Apparently.

898
00:50:01,101 --> 00:50:03,401
A blacklist of employees.

899
00:50:04,831 --> 00:50:07,370
I didn't get to say so earlier,

900
00:50:07,371 --> 00:50:10,130
but my son works at TQ headquarters.

901
00:50:10,131 --> 00:50:12,631
Does he? At which department?

902
00:50:13,131 --> 00:50:16,071
He said it was a financial position.

903
00:50:17,171 --> 00:50:19,401
Financial Management? Accounting?

904
00:50:20,101 --> 00:50:23,301
They're both very respectable departments.

905
00:50:24,931 --> 00:50:27,530
Seeing you both makes me feel extra proud.

906
00:50:27,531 --> 00:50:29,500
My son gets to work in...

907
00:50:29,501 --> 00:50:31,731
an office and not out in the field like me.

908
00:50:32,931 --> 00:50:35,931
- I should get back to work.
- Just a moment.

909
00:50:36,201 --> 00:50:37,400
When you get back,

910
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:39,800
please tell your superiors
about our plight.

911
00:50:39,801 --> 00:50:42,171
Yes, I will.

912
00:50:42,331 --> 00:50:44,100
Call me when you're done.

913
00:50:44,101 --> 00:50:45,731
I have to get my things.

914
00:50:46,201 --> 00:50:49,300
I will. Give the man his jacket.

915
00:50:49,301 --> 00:50:51,601
No. I'll keep it on until we're done.

916
00:50:51,831 --> 00:50:53,130
Bye, then.

917
00:50:53,131 --> 00:50:54,131
- Bye.
- Bye.

918
00:50:54,132 --> 00:50:56,370
- Take care.
- I will, thanks.

919
00:50:56,371 --> 00:50:58,201
- Ha Gyeong.
- What?

920
00:50:58,631 --> 00:50:59,701
Fight.

921
00:51:06,501 --> 00:51:08,130
Prosecutor Han's investigator?

922
00:51:08,131 --> 00:51:10,500
We aren't sure about that.

923
00:51:10,501 --> 00:51:11,830
It could be an investigator,

924
00:51:11,831 --> 00:51:14,431
but we could have an employee
leaking information.

925
00:51:14,671 --> 00:51:18,031
What's positive is that there is a mole.

926
00:51:18,571 --> 00:51:20,670
Prosecutor Han must be behind this.

927
00:51:20,671 --> 00:51:23,530
Someone else seems to be
targeting the chairman.

928
00:51:23,531 --> 00:51:26,630
Who? Do you mean the chairman's wife?

929
00:51:26,631 --> 00:51:28,231
Were you aware of that?

930
00:51:29,431 --> 00:51:32,370
He was a target ever since
he stole her company.

931
00:51:32,371 --> 00:51:34,101
Whoever the leak is,

932
00:51:34,401 --> 00:51:37,231
it's someone very close to home.

933
00:51:37,401 --> 00:51:40,431
I say it's Accounting
or Business Operations.

934
00:51:41,271 --> 00:51:43,600
Screen everyone in both departments.

935
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:45,231
Yes, Sir.

936
00:51:48,301 --> 00:51:49,530
I should go inside.

937
00:51:49,531 --> 00:51:51,471
I'm just a nuisance here.

938
00:51:51,701 --> 00:51:53,800
I'll come by when the negotiations end.

939
00:51:53,801 --> 00:51:57,830
You do that. Let's have
marinated shrimp with soju.

940
00:51:57,831 --> 00:51:58,901
Sure.

941
00:52:02,231 --> 00:52:03,231
Go, go.

942
00:52:04,631 --> 00:52:06,271
Quick march.

943
00:52:06,971 --> 00:52:09,370
- Who are they?
- Who are you?

944
00:52:09,371 --> 00:52:11,601
What are you doing here?

945
00:52:12,301 --> 00:52:14,631
Who are you? What do you want?

946
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:21,631
We're from a security company.
Gather round.

947
00:52:23,301 --> 00:52:25,070
Why should we gather round?

948
00:52:25,071 --> 00:52:26,431
Get out of here.

949
00:52:27,671 --> 00:52:28,701
Joon Kwon.

950
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:31,200
I can tell right away that...

951
00:52:31,201 --> 00:52:33,001
they fight for a living.

952
00:52:33,301 --> 00:52:36,331
What? No, that can't be.

953
00:52:36,531 --> 00:52:38,630
They're experts. Look in their eyes.

954
00:52:38,631 --> 00:52:41,331
They don't care for women,
kids, or the elderly.

955
00:52:42,071 --> 00:52:44,401
They punch anyone. Let's get out of here.

956
00:52:45,201 --> 00:52:46,670
Even if that's the case,

957
00:52:46,671 --> 00:52:48,431
I won't run away.

958
00:52:49,931 --> 00:52:50,971
Attack!

959
00:52:52,701 --> 00:52:55,471
(Reduce work hours and labor intensity!)

960
00:52:57,001 --> 00:52:59,331
Let go! Let go of me!

961
00:52:59,901 --> 00:53:01,571
Who do you think you are?

962
00:53:07,371 --> 00:53:09,501
You can't do this!

963
00:53:10,971 --> 00:53:12,171
Leave us alone!

964
00:53:22,031 --> 00:53:23,101
Let go of me!

965
00:53:29,531 --> 00:53:31,271
(Final Accounts)

966
00:53:37,431 --> 00:53:39,330
(Chief Kim Seong Ryong)

967
00:53:39,331 --> 00:53:40,331
(Calling)

968
00:53:53,631 --> 00:53:55,901
Don't come closer. Stay away.

969
00:53:56,271 --> 00:53:58,301
Don't follow me!

970
00:53:58,431 --> 00:53:59,971
Out of my way!

971
00:54:00,631 --> 00:54:02,100
Stay there!

972
00:54:02,101 --> 00:54:04,330
Why are you following me?

973
00:54:04,331 --> 00:54:06,601
Don't come any closer!

974
00:54:07,471 --> 00:54:10,500
What do you want from me? Leave me alone!

975
00:54:10,501 --> 00:54:13,470
Wait, stop! Timeout!

976
00:54:13,471 --> 00:54:14,531
Stop.

977
00:54:20,031 --> 00:54:21,730
I have the report, Sir.

978
00:54:21,731 --> 00:54:23,270
Send it to General Affairs.

979
00:54:23,271 --> 00:54:25,600
Check again tomorrow
before printing it out,

980
00:54:25,601 --> 00:54:27,630
and tell them to check
the Chinese translation.

981
00:54:27,631 --> 00:54:28,801
Yes, Sir.

982
00:54:33,231 --> 00:54:35,901
Good job, everyone.

983
00:54:37,901 --> 00:54:39,501
Great job.

984
00:54:43,331 --> 00:54:46,231
- What's wrong?
- We have a problem outside.

985
00:54:48,701 --> 00:54:49,801
What problem?

986
00:54:53,101 --> 00:54:55,671
(Work environment and charges!)

987
00:54:56,171 --> 00:54:59,631
Stop! What do you think you're doing?

988
00:55:00,171 --> 00:55:01,271
Help me.

989
00:55:02,301 --> 00:55:04,430
Let go of me!

990
00:55:04,431 --> 00:55:07,071
Let me go! Get your hands off me!

991
00:55:10,731 --> 00:55:12,071
Leave us alone!

992
00:55:12,271 --> 00:55:15,071
Get out of here! Get out!

993
00:55:15,331 --> 00:55:17,231
You can't do this to us!

994
00:55:22,501 --> 00:55:24,130
Why are you after me?

995
00:55:24,131 --> 00:55:25,930
What do you want me for?

996
00:55:25,931 --> 00:55:28,230
Am I your type? Is that it?

997
00:55:28,231 --> 00:55:29,801
Who are you?

998
00:55:30,771 --> 00:55:32,271
Do you like me, too?

999
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:33,931
Wait.

1000
00:55:34,771 --> 00:55:37,670
I'm not going anywhere!

1001
00:55:37,671 --> 00:55:39,100
What do you want?

1002
00:55:39,101 --> 00:55:41,200
I have nothing! Let me go!

1003
00:55:41,201 --> 00:55:43,370
Where are you taking me?

1004
00:55:43,371 --> 00:55:45,000
Put me down!

1005
00:55:45,001 --> 00:55:46,600
Someone call the police!

1006
00:55:46,601 --> 00:55:48,900
I don't work at TQ Delivery!

1007
00:55:48,901 --> 00:55:50,370
Do you know who I am?

1008
00:55:50,371 --> 00:55:52,271
I'm Mr. Righteous!

1009
00:56:01,631 --> 00:56:04,201
Cho Min Young, you've lost your mind.

1010
00:56:05,431 --> 00:56:06,770
Who are those people?

1011
00:56:06,771 --> 00:56:08,431
They're from a private firm.

1012
00:56:09,231 --> 00:56:12,030
Whoever they are, they can't do this.

1013
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:15,301
This is their fight. They'll deal with it.

1014
00:56:16,271 --> 00:56:17,471
Chief.

1015
00:56:19,171 --> 00:56:21,231
Don't go. It's dangerous.

1016
00:56:21,871 --> 00:56:23,130
I have to go.

1017
00:56:23,131 --> 00:56:25,271
Chief Kim's among them.

1018
00:56:43,131 --> 00:56:45,701
Let go! Let go of me, you fools!

1019
00:56:46,031 --> 00:56:47,370
How dare you.

1020
00:56:47,371 --> 00:56:49,600
What are you doing? Let go!

1021
00:56:49,601 --> 00:56:52,031
- Stop this!
- Shoot.

1022
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:54,300
Who are you?

1023
00:56:54,301 --> 00:56:55,771
Freeze!

1024
00:57:00,031 --> 00:57:03,230
How dare you glare at me.
Who do you think you are?

1025
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:04,371
Stop!

1026
00:57:10,201 --> 00:57:11,301
Fall back!

1027
00:57:12,171 --> 00:57:13,530
Come back here!

1028
00:57:13,531 --> 00:57:14,700
- My back...
- Are you okay?

1029
00:57:14,701 --> 00:57:16,270
Don't touch me.

1030
00:57:16,271 --> 00:57:18,031
Can you get up?

1031
00:57:18,331 --> 00:57:20,701
- Yes.
- I hurt all over.

1032
00:57:21,801 --> 00:57:23,230
- Can you walk?
- Are you okay?

1033
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:25,170
- Are you okay?
- Yes, thanks.

1034
00:57:25,171 --> 00:57:26,171
Good.

1035
00:57:27,301 --> 00:57:28,831
Are you okay?

1036
00:57:31,271 --> 00:57:32,601
I can't do this.

1037
00:57:34,771 --> 00:57:38,131
(Couriers are humans! We
want to live like one!)

1038
00:57:44,671 --> 00:57:47,900
(Enforcers)

1039
00:57:47,901 --> 00:57:52,301
Get this thing off me! It stinks!
I'm dying here!

1040
00:57:52,531 --> 00:57:56,271
It smells like it was stuck
up someone's bottom!

1041
00:57:56,701 --> 00:57:58,701
Where are you taking me?

1042
00:58:02,171 --> 00:58:03,801
That's too bright.

1043
00:58:08,501 --> 00:58:09,530
Who are you?

1044
00:58:09,531 --> 00:58:12,401
I'm glad you made it, Mr. Labor Union.

1045
00:58:12,631 --> 00:58:13,730
Mister what?

1046
00:58:13,731 --> 00:58:16,701
You're the head of TQ
Delivery's labor union.

1047
00:58:19,271 --> 00:58:20,331
I'm what?

1048
00:58:21,501 --> 00:58:23,000
(Let me go, jerks!)

1049
00:58:23,001 --> 00:58:24,630
(I'm really scared.)

1050
00:58:24,631 --> 00:58:26,370
(Let me go, jerks!)

1051
00:58:26,371 --> 00:58:28,130
(I'm really scared.)

1052
00:58:28,131 --> 00:58:29,770
(Let me go, jerks!)

1053
00:58:29,771 --> 00:58:31,430
(I'm really scared.)

1054
00:58:31,431 --> 00:58:33,501
(Let me go, jerks!)

1055
00:58:34,801 --> 00:58:37,400
(Hello, Mr. Labor Union. Welcome.)

1056
00:58:37,401 --> 00:58:41,100
(I'm what? No way.)

1057
00:58:41,101 --> 00:58:42,901
(Chief Kim)

1058
00:58:43,301 --> 00:58:46,771
This is a trial of the utmost difficulty.

1059
00:58:48,101 --> 00:58:50,470
- Life is an adventure.
- Chief!

1060
00:58:50,471 --> 00:58:52,570
Take the money and run.

1061
00:58:52,571 --> 00:58:54,300
TQ must apologize!

1062
00:58:54,301 --> 00:58:56,900
We paid off the head of the labor union.

1063
00:58:56,901 --> 00:58:58,930
He took the money and denied it.

1064
00:58:58,931 --> 00:59:00,200
Did you stab us in the back?

1065
00:59:00,201 --> 00:59:02,430
Is this how you both will keep doing this?

1066
00:59:02,431 --> 00:59:03,670
If it weren't for you,

1067
00:59:03,671 --> 00:59:06,170
I wouldn't have been disgraced!

1068
00:59:06,171 --> 00:59:07,270
Where did he go?

1069
00:59:07,271 --> 00:59:10,030
Stop hiring thugs and messing things up!

1070
00:59:10,031 --> 00:59:11,971
I have to get somewhere in a hurry.
