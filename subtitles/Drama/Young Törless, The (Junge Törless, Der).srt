3
00:00:26,722 --> 00:00:27,922
I miss you.

4
00:00:31,822 --> 00:00:34,452
An engineering student can't even fix that?

5
00:00:34,752 --> 00:00:37,022
Give me a minute.

6
00:00:37,122 --> 00:00:38,422
Did you really go to engineering school?

7
00:01:13,522 --> 00:01:14,652
Hello.

8
00:01:15,152 --> 00:01:18,892
I'm sorry. I know it's late, but can you open the door?

9
00:01:23,482 --> 00:01:24,852
What is it?

10
00:01:25,022 --> 00:01:27,652
It's really urgent.

11
00:01:29,752 --> 00:01:31,622
May I get the Wi-Fi password?

12
00:01:35,182 --> 00:01:37,352
- Hurry. - Okay.

13
00:01:40,052 --> 00:01:42,922
There's something wrong with our router.

14
00:01:45,752 --> 00:01:47,282
Hello?

15
00:01:48,352 --> 00:01:49,422
Hello?

16
00:02:04,352 --> 00:02:07,122
I fixed it! Turn it on.

17
00:02:08,052 --> 00:02:09,292
I don't think it'll work.

18
00:02:22,182 --> 00:02:23,352
(Thinking)

19
00:02:25,292 --> 00:02:26,522
(Jung Soo Kyung)

20
00:02:26,982 --> 00:02:29,022
Time's up already. Your session is over.

21
00:02:29,752 --> 00:02:30,952
What about my prescription?

22
00:02:31,922 --> 00:02:34,222
I have a meeting to attend.

23
00:02:34,652 --> 00:02:36,552
My stomach hurts all the time.

24
00:02:36,552 --> 00:02:39,652
If you turn right at the door, that's the washroom.

25
00:02:39,652 --> 00:02:41,852
It's more difficult to sleep these days.

26
00:02:41,852 --> 00:02:43,482
Give me a stronger sleeping pill.

27
00:02:43,722 --> 00:02:45,252
If you can't sleep,

28
00:02:45,252 --> 00:02:46,922
you need to tire yourself out.

29
00:02:47,452 --> 00:02:48,852
Meet your boyfriend.

30
00:02:48,852 --> 00:02:50,222
Isn't it a good time for you?

31
00:02:51,652 --> 00:02:54,822
Dr. Jung, you're not qualified to be a doctor.

32
00:02:54,822 --> 00:02:58,382
What about you? You won't answer any questions.

33
00:02:58,382 --> 00:03:00,222
I asked you to write journals, and you didn't.

34
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:02,082
Do you think you're a qualified patient?

35
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:04,522
If I write journals, will you give me the prescription?

36
00:03:04,522 --> 00:03:07,052
Yes. Write journals.

37
00:03:07,052 --> 00:03:09,082
Start from your happiest moment...

38
00:03:09,082 --> 00:03:12,082
to your worst moment. All of it.

39
00:03:12,782 --> 00:03:14,282
I was 28.

40
00:03:14,282 --> 00:03:17,082
When I quit this hospital which I worked for two years,

41
00:03:17,252 --> 00:03:20,052
I thought I would face a drastic change.

42
00:03:21,882 --> 00:03:23,782
Mending a relationship...

43
00:03:24,482 --> 00:03:26,882
is one of the lies I realized...

44
00:03:28,652 --> 00:03:30,082
while living this life.

45
00:03:39,722 --> 00:03:41,182
A true relationship...

46
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:44,922
is found in the balance between not harming others...

47
00:03:45,652 --> 00:03:47,622
and not getting harmed by others.

48
00:03:50,952 --> 00:03:54,352
I seek for my own type of happiness.

49
00:03:56,052 --> 00:03:57,752
I'm happier by myself.

50
00:03:58,782 --> 00:04:05,482
(Individualist Ms. Ji Young)

51
00:04:10,482 --> 00:04:11,522
Hello.

52
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,252
Hello.

53
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:17,422
Hello, unit 704.

54
00:04:18,682 --> 00:04:20,352
Unit 704. Hello.

55
00:04:23,182 --> 00:04:25,052
Isn't it fun?

56
00:04:25,052 --> 00:04:27,382
It's not fun at all.

57
00:04:29,022 --> 00:04:30,252
Hello, 704.

58
00:04:33,352 --> 00:04:34,382
Ye Jin.

59
00:04:35,922 --> 00:04:36,922
Hello.

60
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:45,952
700...

61
00:04:46,782 --> 00:04:47,782
Okay.

62
00:04:51,052 --> 00:04:52,052
My...

63
00:04:53,522 --> 00:04:54,522
gosh.

64
00:04:55,622 --> 00:04:58,592
This is for unit 705, but can you take it?

65
00:04:58,592 --> 00:05:00,022
- Pardon? - Thank you.

66
00:05:00,322 --> 00:05:01,322
Hey!

67
00:05:09,252 --> 00:05:11,052
(Please leave it with unit 704.)

68
00:05:12,852 --> 00:05:13,852
Hello.

69
00:05:14,552 --> 00:05:16,592
Here. This is for keeping the package for me.

70
00:05:17,282 --> 00:05:19,952
Let's help each other from time to time.

71
00:05:23,522 --> 00:05:26,052
I told you it was important.

72
00:05:26,052 --> 00:05:27,052
Open up.

73
00:05:27,522 --> 00:05:29,522
Why did you ask her to take it for us?

74
00:05:30,422 --> 00:05:33,182
I didn't know she would do that.

75
00:05:34,182 --> 00:05:36,452
I'm sorry. Don't be mad.

76
00:05:36,822 --> 00:05:38,152
- It's not working anymore. - Here.

77
00:05:38,622 --> 00:05:42,852
You're right. We should tell her to pay for it.

78
00:05:43,382 --> 00:05:44,382
Let's break up.

79
00:05:46,082 --> 00:05:47,082
What?

80
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:50,822
What is it all of a sudden?

81
00:05:50,822 --> 00:05:52,222
Did I do something wrong?

82
00:05:52,222 --> 00:05:53,722
Did I make you upset?

83
00:05:53,722 --> 00:05:55,952
Say something at least.

84
00:05:56,722 --> 00:05:59,082
That way I can explain myself or make an excuse.

85
00:06:02,122 --> 00:06:03,222
Ji Young.

86
00:06:19,422 --> 00:06:20,422
Ji Young.

87
00:06:21,182 --> 00:06:22,182
Ji Young!

88
00:06:26,752 --> 00:06:28,682
Ye Jin, don't go! Where are you going?

89
00:06:28,682 --> 00:06:30,452
I'm going to Mom.

90
00:06:30,452 --> 00:06:32,952
- Where? Where is your mom? - She's somewhere.

91
00:06:32,952 --> 00:06:34,722
- What are you talking about? - Ji Young!

92
00:06:35,222 --> 00:06:37,452
- Why are you doing this? - Let go.

93
00:06:37,452 --> 00:06:39,452
- There must be a reason, right? - Don't!

94
00:06:39,452 --> 00:06:41,422
- I should know why. - I just want to end it.

95
00:06:41,482 --> 00:06:42,652
Ji Young.

96
00:06:42,722 --> 00:06:45,152
I'm sick of you!

97
00:06:45,152 --> 00:06:46,182
Ji Young.

98
00:06:46,182 --> 00:06:48,522
Why are you doing this to me all of a sudden?

99
00:06:48,522 --> 00:06:51,082
- Let go. I gave you enough hints. - Ji Young.

100
00:06:51,082 --> 00:06:52,582
It's your fault for being slow.

101
00:06:52,582 --> 00:06:53,952
Please don't go, Ye Jin.

102
00:06:53,952 --> 00:06:55,322
- Let go. - Ji Young.

103
00:06:55,322 --> 00:06:58,282
- I can't eat or do anything without you. - Ji Young.

104
00:06:58,282 --> 00:06:59,752
Gosh.

105
00:07:00,582 --> 00:07:03,252
- Ji Young... - Ye Jin, don't leave.

106
00:07:03,352 --> 00:07:06,182
- Ye Jin. - What's wrong with you?

107
00:07:07,952 --> 00:07:09,082
Ji Young!

108
00:07:10,552 --> 00:07:12,182
Hey, come on.

109
00:07:12,422 --> 00:07:14,722
Ji Young, at least talk to me.

110
00:07:15,582 --> 00:07:16,582
Give it.

111
00:07:16,582 --> 00:07:18,352
- Please. - Give it back.

112
00:07:18,352 --> 00:07:20,182
- Ji Young! - I said, let go!

113
00:07:20,182 --> 00:07:22,952
- Ji Young! - Please forgive me.

114
00:07:22,952 --> 00:07:27,152
I'm leaving. What's wrong with you? You're so annoying.

115
00:07:27,152 --> 00:07:28,382
Don't go, Ye Jin.

116
00:07:28,382 --> 00:07:30,882
Ji Young. Na Ji Young!

117
00:07:31,222 --> 00:07:32,882
Open the door, Na Ji Young!

118
00:07:41,782 --> 00:07:43,482
Don't go!

119
00:07:47,652 --> 00:07:48,922
Open the door!

120
00:07:55,252 --> 00:07:58,482
Are all problems my fault?

121
00:07:59,122 --> 00:08:02,522
Did all of this happen because of me?

122
00:08:04,182 --> 00:08:07,722
If a penalty can be imposed, please go ahead.

123
00:08:07,722 --> 00:08:10,352
It's not like you don't know each other.

124
00:08:10,352 --> 00:08:12,622
Why don't you come to an agreement?

125
00:08:12,622 --> 00:08:14,822
The penalty won't be much anyway.

126
00:08:15,022 --> 00:08:17,422
It won't help the country.

127
00:08:18,222 --> 00:08:20,052
I don't want to.

128
00:08:21,252 --> 00:08:22,582
I don't want to either.

129
00:08:22,852 --> 00:08:23,852
Hey.

130
00:08:24,852 --> 00:08:27,882
What did we do so wrong?

131
00:08:28,222 --> 00:08:31,082
Is it a crime to stop your lover?

132
00:08:31,622 --> 00:08:33,252
Is it a crime?

133
00:08:34,082 --> 00:08:35,622
Trespassing, damage to property,

134
00:08:35,622 --> 00:08:38,022
stalking, concocting fear, and damaging women's rights.

135
00:08:38,552 --> 00:08:40,652
If these are not crimes, what are they?

136
00:08:41,352 --> 00:08:43,052
What are you talking about?

137
00:08:46,222 --> 00:08:48,882
It's not completely wrong.

138
00:08:48,882 --> 00:08:51,222
Right, sir?

139
00:08:55,782 --> 00:08:58,452
She's requesting protective custody,

140
00:08:58,452 --> 00:09:00,052
so you should stay here until tomorrow morning.

141
00:09:00,152 --> 00:09:01,852
Pardon? Tomorrow morning?

142
00:09:02,282 --> 00:09:04,782
But... If I stay until tomorrow morning...

143
00:09:05,082 --> 00:09:07,482
Hey. Ye Jin.

144
00:09:08,022 --> 00:09:10,352
I'm sorry. I deserve to die.

145
00:09:10,852 --> 00:09:12,522
- For what? - For everything.

146
00:09:12,522 --> 00:09:15,052
I'm sorry about everything, so don't go.

147
00:09:15,052 --> 00:09:17,952
Byuk Soo, please stop.

148
00:09:17,952 --> 00:09:20,722
Do you know how suffocating it is to have you chase me?

149
00:09:20,722 --> 00:09:23,922
I feel like I'm being used because of your loneliness.

150
00:09:23,922 --> 00:09:25,692
Hey...

151
00:09:25,692 --> 00:09:29,022
How can you say that I used you?

152
00:09:31,692 --> 00:09:32,692
(Affidavit of Incident)

153
00:09:33,582 --> 00:09:35,322
Hey, Ye Jin!

154
00:09:35,722 --> 00:09:36,782
Ye Jin!

155
00:09:36,952 --> 00:09:39,282
Ye Jin, I'm going to wait for you!

156
00:09:39,722 --> 00:09:41,122
Ye Jin!

157
00:09:41,922 --> 00:09:42,952
Ye Jin...

158
00:09:46,582 --> 00:09:47,652
That plant...

159
00:09:49,152 --> 00:09:50,852
Didn't I give it to you...

160
00:09:50,852 --> 00:09:52,552
for your parents' wedding anniversary?

161
00:09:52,552 --> 00:09:54,222
I didn't get a chance to give it to them.

162
00:09:56,922 --> 00:09:59,322
Then why did you leave it in the hallway to die?

163
00:09:59,422 --> 00:10:01,752
I told you I hate raising things.

164
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:05,552
You need to fix that personality of yours.

165
00:10:07,322 --> 00:10:09,022
Who are you to tell me what to do?

166
00:10:09,022 --> 00:10:10,582
I dated you for three months,

167
00:10:10,582 --> 00:10:12,082
but I never went into your place.

168
00:10:12,082 --> 00:10:13,252
I don't know your birthday,

169
00:10:13,252 --> 00:10:16,382
and you never introduced me to your friends. I...

170
00:10:17,582 --> 00:10:19,622
Was I even your boyfriend?

171
00:10:20,422 --> 00:10:23,052
You never told me that you missed me or loved me.

172
00:10:32,452 --> 00:10:33,882
At least tell me the reason.

173
00:10:34,822 --> 00:10:36,022
Tell me why we broke up.

174
00:10:40,082 --> 00:10:41,722
Then let me ask you something.

175
00:10:42,022 --> 00:10:43,192
On Christmas,

176
00:10:44,282 --> 00:10:46,652
you said you are working. What is your plan?

177
00:10:46,652 --> 00:10:49,122
Do you think you have the right to ask me?

178
00:10:49,722 --> 00:10:52,622
You sneaked through my phone to see my schedule.

179
00:10:52,822 --> 00:10:54,622
What's so bad about checking...

180
00:10:55,252 --> 00:10:56,422
(I had a hard time.)

181
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:57,722
Fine.

182
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:00,882
I went through your texts to see if you were cheating.

183
00:11:00,882 --> 00:11:02,582
That's why I'm asking now.

184
00:11:03,022 --> 00:11:05,822
Who is the person that said they missed you?

185
00:11:06,622 --> 00:11:08,652
Why did you lie to me?

186
00:11:10,022 --> 00:11:11,022
Ji Young.

187
00:11:12,522 --> 00:11:13,752
Na Ji Young!

188
00:11:15,122 --> 00:11:16,382
You should be thankful I dated you...

189
00:11:16,382 --> 00:11:19,152
until now instead of just sleeping with you!

190
00:11:19,422 --> 00:11:21,222
Who'd like someone like you?

191
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:25,052
I hope you live like that forever and die alone!

192
00:11:25,182 --> 00:11:26,752
I hope you do!

193
00:11:37,222 --> 00:11:39,522
It'd be immature to blame someone else.

194
00:11:40,652 --> 00:11:42,622
So I will only complain to myself.

195
00:11:43,882 --> 00:11:46,322
It's because I haven't been careful.

196
00:11:47,022 --> 00:11:48,022
It's my fault.

197
00:11:48,882 --> 00:11:51,182
Could I see Kim Yeon Suk?

198
00:11:51,182 --> 00:11:53,322
Are you his customer?

199
00:11:53,852 --> 00:11:54,852
No.

200
00:11:55,952 --> 00:11:57,582
He's my boyfriend.

201
00:11:57,582 --> 00:11:58,582
Pardon?

202
00:12:00,552 --> 00:12:02,052
He's my boyfriend.

203
00:12:03,082 --> 00:12:05,052
It was so delicious.

204
00:12:05,052 --> 00:12:07,882
- Hey. - Thank you for lunch.

205
00:12:07,882 --> 00:12:09,382
- See you later. - Okay.

206
00:12:12,352 --> 00:12:14,452
What's this? Are you cheating?

207
00:12:15,182 --> 00:12:16,652
She's cute,

208
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:18,182
but she's too high maintenance.

209
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:21,752
So? Do you like your girlfriend because she's not?

210
00:12:21,752 --> 00:12:24,382
Come on. A girl has to be sociable and cute.

211
00:12:24,382 --> 00:12:26,422
That's the fun part of dating.

212
00:12:26,422 --> 00:12:28,382
You should be happy.

213
00:12:28,382 --> 00:12:30,052
"Do this for me. Do that for me."

214
00:12:30,052 --> 00:12:32,022
"Is it me or work?"

215
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,852
"Are your friends more important?" She doesn't do that.

216
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:38,422
On top of that, she has a nice body and a pretty face.

217
00:12:38,422 --> 00:12:41,722
It's good that she doesn't bother me like other girls.

218
00:12:42,122 --> 00:12:45,182
- What is it? Is there a problem? - Something's off.

219
00:12:45,782 --> 00:12:48,282
I feel like I'm dating someone abnormal.

220
00:12:48,652 --> 00:12:52,752
She said she can't see me on Christmas due to work.

221
00:12:53,452 --> 00:12:55,452
I was suspicious, so I checked her phone.

222
00:12:55,952 --> 00:12:57,852
She's not working that day.

223
00:12:58,882 --> 00:13:00,122
- Gosh. - Goodness.

224
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:07,752
People. Relationships.

225
00:13:08,152 --> 00:13:10,922
Social life. Small misunderstandings...

226
00:13:11,022 --> 00:13:12,822
and bothersome emotional disputes.

227
00:13:13,122 --> 00:13:14,922
It's a waste of energy.

228
00:13:14,952 --> 00:13:17,022
People force others out of line.

229
00:13:17,082 --> 00:13:19,382
Selfishness is hidden behind empathy.

230
00:13:20,082 --> 00:13:21,782
Foolish humanism.

231
00:13:22,782 --> 00:13:25,282
None of it is real. It's all hypocrisy.

232
00:13:26,852 --> 00:13:28,922
Today, I succeeded again...

233
00:13:29,552 --> 00:13:31,752
in protecting myself from it all.

234
00:13:31,752 --> 00:13:35,022
Sir. I won't do anything. Please let me go home.

235
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:37,282
I can't sleep unless it's my bed.

236
00:13:37,282 --> 00:13:39,722
I have a stomachache. I need the toilet.

237
00:13:41,182 --> 00:13:42,552
Thank you.

238
00:13:43,552 --> 00:13:46,222
- Where are you running away to? - I'm sorry.

239
00:13:46,222 --> 00:13:47,352
I'm sorry, sir.

240
00:13:47,422 --> 00:13:52,482
There are only two hours left. I really have to leave!

241
00:13:54,022 --> 00:13:55,222
I have to go.

242
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:57,022
What do I do?

243
00:13:58,122 --> 00:13:59,352
Let me out!

244
00:14:03,282 --> 00:14:06,482
Please let me out! Sir!

245
00:14:19,252 --> 00:14:20,322
Hello?

246
00:14:20,922 --> 00:14:23,082
Ji Young, why haven't you picked up?

247
00:14:23,222 --> 00:14:25,882
- Must I use someone else's number... - Excuse me.

248
00:14:26,122 --> 00:14:28,952
Are you sure you want a 12-digit password?

249
00:14:29,482 --> 00:14:31,682
It's safer, but...

250
00:14:32,282 --> 00:14:34,622
- it'd be annoying. - That's okay.

251
00:14:34,622 --> 00:14:35,682
Okay.

252
00:14:36,622 --> 00:14:37,782
One moment.

253
00:14:38,182 --> 00:14:39,882
It's ready. You can set the password now.

254
00:14:40,052 --> 00:14:41,082
Okay.

255
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:50,752
Excuse me. Excuse me.

256
00:14:54,182 --> 00:14:55,922
Don't bother saying sorry.

257
00:14:56,082 --> 00:14:58,322
It's not like that'll make me feel better.

258
00:14:59,052 --> 00:15:00,622
Can you get out of my way?

259
00:15:04,822 --> 00:15:07,152
What? Hey!

260
00:15:07,482 --> 00:15:09,052
Because of you, we...

261
00:15:14,922 --> 00:15:16,182
Gosh.

262
00:15:20,782 --> 00:15:22,752
She should have raised it well.

263
00:15:23,782 --> 00:15:24,952
What a mean person.

264
00:15:34,422 --> 00:15:37,852
He might die. It's room 301 at Nasan Hospital.

265
00:15:39,222 --> 00:15:41,822
(Block number.)

266
00:15:46,352 --> 00:15:48,652
Can humans live without each other?

267
00:15:49,052 --> 00:15:53,022
The desire to be loved is one of the most basic needs.

268
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:55,022
(Business Proposal)

269
00:15:55,652 --> 00:15:58,722
This heart. We often use it for "likes".

270
00:15:58,882 --> 00:16:01,952
It derived from human's basic need to be loved.

271
00:16:02,022 --> 00:16:05,122
Humans cannot live while ignoring the others.

272
00:16:05,822 --> 00:16:08,052
We are in isolation.

273
00:16:08,052 --> 00:16:10,022
(Ye Jin has blocked Byuk Soo.)

274
00:16:12,152 --> 00:16:14,782
(This account is private.)

275
00:16:20,922 --> 00:16:24,752
Mr. Choi. Can I borrow your Instagram ID?

276
00:16:24,882 --> 00:16:27,482
Why? To look at your ex-girlfriend's account?

277
00:16:27,782 --> 00:16:30,552
Just make a new account and request to follow.

278
00:16:33,122 --> 00:16:34,952
She didn't accept it, did she?

279
00:16:42,682 --> 00:16:45,782
- What is it? - She and I don't follow each other.

280
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:48,622
- But... - I have a stomachache. I'll be back.

281
00:16:48,622 --> 00:16:49,752
Mr. Choi.

282
00:16:53,252 --> 00:16:55,722
Mr. Park. I'm sorry,

283
00:16:56,282 --> 00:16:57,752
but can you take care of this for me?

284
00:16:57,752 --> 00:17:00,182
- Sure. Please leave it here. - Thanks.

285
00:17:00,722 --> 00:17:03,182
I have an emergency at home. I'd appreciate it.

286
00:17:03,482 --> 00:17:05,022
I'll take care of it.

287
00:17:05,022 --> 00:17:06,922
- Can you do this? - Sure.

288
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:08,582
Mine too.

289
00:17:08,922 --> 00:17:09,952
Sure.

290
00:17:13,352 --> 00:17:14,392
Mr. Park.

291
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:18,152
- Not again. - I need your year-end tax adjustments.

292
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:21,182
Okay.

293
00:17:28,152 --> 00:17:29,392
Here you go.

294
00:17:32,952 --> 00:17:35,152
- Are you sure you printed it right? - Pardon?

295
00:17:37,152 --> 00:17:41,352
My parents divorced, so it's just my mother's name.

296
00:17:41,652 --> 00:17:43,322
I'm sorry I asked you.

297
00:17:43,682 --> 00:17:45,392
It's okay.

298
00:17:46,522 --> 00:17:48,922
What about income tax deduction form?

299
00:17:50,582 --> 00:17:51,892
I forgot.

300
00:17:52,652 --> 00:17:54,782
I'll bring it to you on Monday. I promise.

301
00:17:55,222 --> 00:17:56,222
Okay.

302
00:17:58,182 --> 00:17:59,652
Gosh, she's so cold.

303
00:18:11,822 --> 00:18:13,782
(Mom)

304
00:18:17,552 --> 00:18:19,122
Hey, Mom.

305
00:18:20,552 --> 00:18:22,682
No, it's nothing much.

306
00:18:24,722 --> 00:18:26,682
I was thinking of visiting you today.

307
00:18:29,392 --> 00:18:33,052
That's true. I'll see you on the weekend anyway. Okay.

308
00:18:33,352 --> 00:18:35,622
Mom? Mom?

309
00:18:36,252 --> 00:18:38,652
Dad. What are you doing today?

310
00:18:38,722 --> 00:18:40,322
You're busy?

311
00:18:40,822 --> 00:18:42,822
No, it's nothing much.

312
00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:45,222
Hey, do you have plans today?

313
00:18:45,682 --> 00:18:49,282
You're busy? You're working late? Okay.

314
00:18:53,452 --> 00:18:56,082
What are you all doing after work today?

315
00:18:57,352 --> 00:18:59,582
Anyone want to drink afterwards?

316
00:19:03,922 --> 00:19:06,222
Warning. He broke up with his girlfriend.

317
00:19:06,322 --> 00:19:08,952
He's so annoying. I hate him.

318
00:19:09,322 --> 00:19:11,782
- What a surprise. - Let's go somewhere expensive.

319
00:19:11,782 --> 00:19:14,682
Okay. Are you paying today?

320
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:19,182
Of course.

321
00:19:20,252 --> 00:19:23,352
- Mr. Park, we love you. - I love you too.

322
00:19:36,952 --> 00:19:38,552
(Ye Jin has accepted your request.)

323
00:19:54,852 --> 00:19:55,952
Hello.

324
00:19:56,822 --> 00:19:58,022
Hello.

325
00:20:00,622 --> 00:20:02,082
What's this?

326
00:20:06,352 --> 00:20:07,952
What was it again?

327
00:20:08,252 --> 00:20:11,892
Don't forget to hand your year-end tax adjustments.

328
00:20:13,152 --> 00:20:14,182
I'm leaving.

329
00:20:17,452 --> 00:20:19,022
She must be mad.

330
00:20:23,582 --> 00:20:25,392
Ji Young.

331
00:20:26,152 --> 00:20:29,182
Do you want to go for beer?

332
00:20:29,722 --> 00:20:30,722
No.

333
00:20:31,822 --> 00:20:36,152
Come on. You're off tomorrow. When else can we drink?

334
00:20:36,422 --> 00:20:37,582
It's annoying.

335
00:20:37,582 --> 00:20:39,522
- Pardon? - I said, it's annoying.

336
00:20:39,522 --> 00:20:41,782
Don't bother me, and go on your own.

337
00:20:42,952 --> 00:20:45,952
Ms. Na, I know you're tired,

338
00:20:46,082 --> 00:20:47,522
but did you just tell us we're annoying?

339
00:20:47,752 --> 00:20:49,452
I won't switch shifts.

340
00:20:52,282 --> 00:20:54,852
Hey, my daughter...

341
00:20:55,122 --> 00:20:58,552
asked Santa that she wants to go to the amusement park.

342
00:20:58,552 --> 00:21:01,482
She wished for it. I don't want her to be sad.

343
00:21:01,752 --> 00:21:05,322
All the other kids will get presents, but not her.

344
00:21:05,322 --> 00:21:07,252
The world won't come to an end...

345
00:21:07,482 --> 00:21:09,022
even if your child knows the truth about Santa.

347
00:21:22,952 --> 00:21:25,622
(Delete pictures.)

348
00:21:25,622 --> 00:21:26,822
(Deleting)

349
00:21:26,892 --> 00:21:28,022
(Delete pictures.)

350
00:21:28,152 --> 00:21:30,822
I'm going to delete it. I'll delete it all!

351
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:32,352
(Delete pictures.)

352
00:21:32,352 --> 00:21:33,552
Delete it...

353
00:21:38,452 --> 00:21:40,852
Mr. Choi, what if I miss her?

354
00:21:40,852 --> 00:21:43,652
I'd at least have to see her pictures.

355
00:21:43,892 --> 00:21:45,752
She started dating another guy right away.

356
00:21:46,352 --> 00:21:49,082
On top of that, it was so quick.

357
00:21:49,082 --> 00:21:52,322
We broke up just two days ago. How can this be?

358
00:21:52,952 --> 00:21:54,952
Could it be? Did she cheat on me?

359
00:21:54,952 --> 00:21:57,082
- Thank you for the drinks. - Thank you.

360
00:22:02,352 --> 00:22:06,522
Mr. Choi. Actually, this isn't the first time.

361
00:22:06,622 --> 00:22:09,882
The one before her. The one before her too.

362
00:22:10,282 --> 00:22:12,382
The one even before that too.

363
00:22:12,952 --> 00:22:14,882
Mr. Park, I'll clear some of the bottles.

364
00:22:19,952 --> 00:22:22,582
Please let's go home now.

365
00:22:24,282 --> 00:22:26,182
I'm going to be alone if I go home.

366
00:22:26,182 --> 00:22:28,082
I don't want to be alone.

367
00:22:28,752 --> 00:22:30,122
Don't leave.

368
00:22:30,122 --> 00:22:32,082
Don't go, Mr. Choi.

369
00:22:32,122 --> 00:22:35,052
Don't go, Mr. Choi.

370
00:22:41,822 --> 00:22:43,852
(409 dollars)

371
00:22:59,052 --> 00:23:00,552
It isn't even midnight.

(Dream Movie Theater)

373
00:23:13,052 --> 00:23:14,622
(I didn't mean it.)

374
00:23:17,282 --> 00:23:18,522
Don't go.

375
00:23:23,482 --> 00:23:24,482
Don't go.

(12th Assistant Deacon)

377
00:24:36,282 --> 00:24:38,522
"Midnight movie". "Late night".

378
00:24:38,522 --> 00:24:40,782
"Horror movie". "Guess whom I'm with."

379
00:24:40,782 --> 00:24:42,352
"Can you guess?"

380
00:24:42,352 --> 00:24:44,382
"If you guess correctly, you get a prize."

381
00:24:44,382 --> 00:24:45,882
- Did you get a girlfriend? - With a ghost?

382
00:24:45,882 --> 00:24:47,522
- You're not alone, are you? - What's the prize?

383
00:24:47,522 --> 00:24:48,522
You have the time.

384
00:24:48,522 --> 00:24:49,522
You look happy.

385
00:24:49,522 --> 00:24:51,282
Theater two is open now. You may go in.

386
00:24:51,282 --> 00:24:52,952
(Did you get a girlfriend?)

387
00:25:04,752 --> 00:25:05,822
Ta-da!

388
00:25:07,722 --> 00:25:09,522
Can you give me a "like"?

389
00:25:09,582 --> 00:25:12,482
Like.

390
00:25:13,582 --> 00:25:14,922
No.

391
00:25:14,952 --> 00:25:17,252
But... Hey.

392
00:25:18,052 --> 00:25:20,782
No one bought a ticket to the showing of...

393
00:25:20,782 --> 00:25:21,952
"12th Assistant Deacon" starting at 12:15am, right?

394
00:25:21,952 --> 00:25:25,282
Well, sorry. There is one person.

395
00:25:25,282 --> 00:25:26,952
Really?

396
00:25:27,952 --> 00:25:30,322
Then give me the seat as far away as possible.

397
00:25:30,322 --> 00:25:31,722
And a popcorn set please.

398
00:25:31,722 --> 00:25:32,722
Okay.

399
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:36,582
We'll be watching together like good neighbors.

400
00:25:37,822 --> 00:25:39,722
I'll cancel the ticket.

401
00:25:39,722 --> 00:25:43,552
It starts in 10 minutes, so you can't cancel it.

402
00:25:54,122 --> 00:25:55,222
Gosh.

403
00:26:19,552 --> 00:26:20,552
Seriously...

404
00:26:38,122 --> 00:26:40,082
Soda. You forgot it.

405
00:26:49,582 --> 00:26:51,252
(Wise soul that trend died long ago.)

406
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,352
No...

407
00:27:24,882 --> 00:27:27,352
Me? I didn't drink it.

408
00:27:28,082 --> 00:27:29,652
I didn't touch your soda.

409
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:35,352
Sorry.

410
00:27:42,722 --> 00:27:43,782
Seriously.

411
00:27:44,552 --> 00:27:45,552
Darn it.

412
00:27:50,222 --> 00:27:51,222
Wait for me.

413
00:27:53,452 --> 00:27:55,152
It's scary at night.

414
00:27:55,152 --> 00:27:58,052
Let's walk together. Why are you going alone?

415
00:27:58,052 --> 00:27:59,682
I said I'd walk with you.

416
00:28:00,482 --> 00:28:02,222
You shouldn't walk around alone...

417
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:04,082
so late at night. What if something happens?

418
00:28:04,522 --> 00:28:05,682
Excuse me.

419
00:28:08,952 --> 00:28:12,282
What the... Why... Why are you like that?

420
00:28:12,282 --> 00:28:14,822
Why? Why? Darn it.

421
00:28:15,452 --> 00:28:17,052
It's so cold.

422
00:28:18,952 --> 00:28:20,422
The door is closing.

423
00:28:26,252 --> 00:28:29,652
Hey. Why did you press close button when I was coming?

424
00:28:33,782 --> 00:28:35,582
Hey. Look.

425
00:28:36,352 --> 00:28:37,582
Don't you see me?

426
00:28:38,052 --> 00:28:39,052
Hey.

427
00:28:40,022 --> 00:28:41,652
Goodness.

428
00:28:41,782 --> 00:28:44,382
Hold the door. I'm going up too.

429
00:28:58,222 --> 00:29:01,022
May I get in?

430
00:29:01,022 --> 00:29:02,582
Of course. Come in.

431
00:29:20,452 --> 00:29:23,052
Why did you put so much on your lips?

432
00:29:27,752 --> 00:29:29,422
What is that flavor?

433
00:29:34,752 --> 00:29:38,582
Wait. Does that mean...

434
00:29:39,622 --> 00:29:42,082
we kissed indirectly...

435
00:29:46,852 --> 00:29:50,082
Is that why you're upset?

436
00:29:50,082 --> 00:29:51,222
It's okay.

437
00:29:51,452 --> 00:29:53,952
I'll pretend I kissed a stray dog.

438
00:29:54,452 --> 00:29:58,452
What are you, a kid? An indirect kiss? Seriously.

439
00:29:58,452 --> 00:30:01,022
If you think I'm interested in you...

440
00:30:03,952 --> 00:30:05,882
I am not!

441
00:30:05,882 --> 00:30:08,722
I was afraid of walking in the dark and wanted to...

442
00:30:09,552 --> 00:30:10,552
walk together.

443
00:30:10,922 --> 00:30:12,752
Okay, I see.

444
00:30:14,952 --> 00:30:16,482
This is the fifth floor.

445
00:30:18,452 --> 00:30:19,582
Going up.

446
00:30:23,182 --> 00:30:25,682
Wait. Why do you watch movies alone?

447
00:30:25,852 --> 00:30:27,282
Do you eat alone too?

448
00:30:27,822 --> 00:30:30,422
Really? You do everything alone?

449
00:30:30,622 --> 00:30:34,222
I'm not someone who can't do anything alone.

450
00:30:34,282 --> 00:30:36,882
Were you an outcast when you were in school?

451
00:30:39,182 --> 00:30:41,622
Don't you realize how extremely rude you are?

452
00:30:41,622 --> 00:30:45,152
You think all the individualists...

453
00:30:45,152 --> 00:30:47,352
have a problem.

454
00:30:47,352 --> 00:30:50,082
I just find people who act like you...

455
00:30:50,082 --> 00:30:51,422
annoying. That's all.

456
00:30:51,422 --> 00:30:54,622
Wow. You actually know how to speak.

457
00:30:54,622 --> 00:30:56,352
I've never seen you say so much before.

458
00:30:56,352 --> 00:30:59,122
I didn't want to talk to you, so I was holding it in.

459
00:30:59,522 --> 00:31:01,422
You'll end up dying alone.

460
00:31:05,152 --> 00:31:07,452
You don't want to die alone, so you get married.

461
00:31:07,552 --> 00:31:09,752
You don't want to die alone, so you have a kid.

462
00:31:09,752 --> 00:31:11,652
Then the wife dies first.

463
00:31:11,652 --> 00:31:14,052
Then your child will send you to a nursing home.

464
00:31:14,052 --> 00:31:17,322
That's how you end up when you're a fool...

465
00:31:17,322 --> 00:31:18,952
who struggles all his life...

466
00:31:18,952 --> 00:31:21,182
because he's afraid of being alone.

467
00:31:21,522 --> 00:31:24,152
How is that better than dying alone?

468
00:31:26,252 --> 00:31:29,952
What... Why are you making up my future?

469
00:31:29,952 --> 00:31:31,682
Because that's reality.

470
00:31:31,682 --> 00:31:33,552
If you have money, confidence and courage,

471
00:31:33,552 --> 00:31:35,722
you can be alone without any problem.

472
00:31:35,722 --> 00:31:38,352
Without being a complete fool like you.

473
00:31:38,352 --> 00:31:40,782
Complete fool... What the...

474
00:31:41,382 --> 00:31:43,422
It's better than being self-centered like somebody.

475
00:31:43,422 --> 00:31:45,482
It's called being individualistic.

476
00:31:45,482 --> 00:31:47,082
Good for you.

477
00:31:47,082 --> 00:31:49,952
Thank you for the compliment.

478
00:31:50,682 --> 00:31:52,682
Go ahead and live well on your own.

479
00:31:52,682 --> 00:31:55,622
I plan to anyway.

480
00:31:57,422 --> 00:31:59,922
Why do you make your life so complicated?

481
00:32:00,352 --> 00:32:04,122
That's right. That woman changes guys frequently.

482
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:07,122
You were the 2nd. Were you the 3rd?

483
00:32:07,782 --> 00:32:08,852
What?

484
00:32:10,882 --> 00:32:13,482
No, I was wrong. Sorry.

485
00:32:13,482 --> 00:32:15,252
Yes. It's not that...

486
00:32:15,252 --> 00:32:17,022
You were the fourth to be exact.

487
00:32:20,322 --> 00:32:22,422
Darn it. Why that little...

488
00:32:46,452 --> 00:32:49,222
I hate people. I hate other people.

489
00:32:49,882 --> 00:32:53,352
I hate them more today than yesterday. This year...

490
00:33:03,882 --> 00:33:06,482
Hello? This is unit 704.

491
00:33:06,552 --> 00:33:09,422
Would you please tell 705 to keep it down?

492
00:33:09,422 --> 00:33:12,122
Yes. Did you just hear that?

493
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:15,782
Who's doing the dishes at this hour?

494
00:33:16,352 --> 00:33:19,622
Please tell her that is absolutely illogical.

495
00:33:21,422 --> 00:33:24,282
Do you hear that? Would you tell him...

496
00:33:24,482 --> 00:33:27,022
to use earphones when it's this late?

497
00:34:07,652 --> 00:34:08,792
You hate me, right?

498
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:11,052
I hate you too.

499
00:34:11,222 --> 00:34:14,552
I feel like I wasted time and energy because of you,

500
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:15,822
so I regret it.

501
00:34:16,222 --> 00:34:20,022
If we run into each other again, let's walk away...

502
00:34:20,322 --> 00:34:22,152
and just ignore each other. Okay, then.

503
00:34:22,482 --> 00:34:23,552
"Okay, then"?

504
00:34:24,482 --> 00:34:27,292
Not "Okay, goodbye," or "Okay, see you later,"

505
00:34:27,822 --> 00:34:28,922
but "Okay, then"?

506
00:34:52,792 --> 00:34:55,882
See? I told you there's no problem.

507
00:34:59,852 --> 00:35:02,052
There's nothing else? This is everything?

508
00:35:02,352 --> 00:35:04,752
- What? - About the guy next door.

509
00:35:05,422 --> 00:35:06,952
He's a perfect fit for you.

510
00:35:07,382 --> 00:35:08,882
He's hilarious.

511
00:35:08,882 --> 00:35:11,482
You confirmed that I'm fine, so prescribe...

512
00:35:11,482 --> 00:35:13,352
Nothing bad happened to you.

513
00:35:13,552 --> 00:35:15,682
There was nothing wrong with your family.

514
00:35:16,292 --> 00:35:18,252
You date well enough too.

515
00:35:19,652 --> 00:35:21,382
So why are you depressed?

516
00:35:21,382 --> 00:35:23,022
What's wrong with depression?

517
00:35:23,652 --> 00:35:25,682
How many people are actually happy?

518
00:35:25,752 --> 00:35:27,722
Why are you so hostile?

519
00:35:27,722 --> 00:35:32,152
I'm not hostile. I react truthfully to how I feel.

520
00:35:33,522 --> 00:35:35,052
Have you ever missed anyone?

521
00:35:35,382 --> 00:35:37,252
Your parents or a boyfriend, perhaps?

522
00:35:40,522 --> 00:35:42,752
Well, sometimes.

523
00:35:43,082 --> 00:35:44,182
That's good.

524
00:35:44,922 --> 00:35:46,682
That longing...

525
00:35:46,852 --> 00:35:49,522
can be felt only if you care about someone.

526
00:35:50,422 --> 00:35:54,122
There are some patients who have never felt that.

527
00:35:55,652 --> 00:35:56,792
It's so sad.

528
00:35:59,292 --> 00:36:02,382
How can you always end my sessions like that?

529
00:36:04,382 --> 00:36:05,452
I...

530
00:36:06,352 --> 00:36:09,852
can't treat someone who isn't honest to herself.

531
00:36:12,222 --> 00:36:13,852
If you know someone who can, go there.

532
00:36:17,022 --> 00:36:19,422
Write that again. Not for someone else,

533
00:36:19,822 --> 00:36:21,222
but for yourself.

534
00:36:42,422 --> 00:36:43,882
Darn it.

535
00:36:47,952 --> 00:36:49,022
Ji Young.

536
00:36:52,482 --> 00:36:55,792
Ji Young. I said things that were too harsh.

537
00:36:57,022 --> 00:36:59,722
Are you sick? You're sweating.

538
00:37:00,052 --> 00:37:01,922
You don't look well. Hold on.

539
00:37:02,222 --> 00:37:04,052
- Listen to me... - Let go!

540
00:37:10,522 --> 00:37:13,452
Are... Are you okay? Get up.

541
00:37:14,682 --> 00:37:17,022
Don't come after me. Leave.

542
00:37:17,222 --> 00:37:19,882
- Go. Please go. - Ji Young!

543
00:37:36,522 --> 00:37:39,652
Ji Young, are you okay? Ji Young!

544
00:37:43,352 --> 00:37:46,122
- Ji Young! - No. Don't come.

545
00:37:48,152 --> 00:37:50,522
Were you an outcast when you were in school?

546
00:38:03,352 --> 00:38:04,422
Ji Young...

547
00:38:16,022 --> 00:38:17,752
What was that?

548
00:38:19,022 --> 00:38:21,082
Was that a thief?

549
00:38:48,522 --> 00:38:50,222
I'm using the bathroom.

550
00:38:50,222 --> 00:38:52,952
Why are you opening the door?

551
00:38:54,822 --> 00:38:58,252
I... I didn't know. I'm sorry.

552
00:38:59,622 --> 00:39:00,882
That's not right.

553
00:39:01,252 --> 00:39:05,082
Why are you using my bathroom?

554
00:39:05,752 --> 00:39:07,052
I can't...

555
00:39:08,222 --> 00:39:09,292
remember...

556
00:39:10,482 --> 00:39:12,352
my door code.

557
00:39:16,852 --> 00:39:18,352
Excuse me. Did you...

558
00:39:19,822 --> 00:39:20,882
In your clothes...

559
00:39:24,252 --> 00:39:25,352
I did not!

560
00:39:31,522 --> 00:39:34,652
Should I report you for trespassing?

561
00:39:34,792 --> 00:39:36,922
You're so mean!

562
00:39:36,922 --> 00:39:39,422
Look who's talking.

563
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:43,182
You just broke the law. Do you realize that?

564
00:39:46,882 --> 00:39:49,852
What's the locksmith's number? I'll get your clothes.

565
00:39:49,952 --> 00:39:53,352
No. Just lend me something of yours. Anything's fine.

566
00:39:54,122 --> 00:39:55,622
Are you kidding me?

567
00:39:56,252 --> 00:39:58,452
My clothes are all expensive.

568
00:39:58,452 --> 00:40:01,152
They aren't clothes you can get stuff on.

569
00:40:01,152 --> 00:40:03,952
You really can't go into my home.

570
00:40:05,052 --> 00:40:07,252
I'll reimburse you, so please...

571
00:40:07,252 --> 00:40:10,652
Whatever! Then I'll just call the cops.

572
00:40:18,252 --> 00:40:22,322
But you can't touch anything else, okay?

573
00:40:22,722 --> 00:40:23,822
You can't.

574
00:40:33,552 --> 00:40:35,582
No wonder she's so skinny.

575
00:40:37,322 --> 00:40:40,292
I know. It's only been a few days.

576
00:40:40,952 --> 00:40:44,152
Should I still make the code 12 digits again?

577
00:40:44,322 --> 00:40:47,522
Just make it 4. Like 1, 2, 3, 4. Something like that.

578
00:40:47,882 --> 00:40:49,082
She'll change it.

579
00:41:22,052 --> 00:41:23,792
It's the same breed as Yang Soon.

580
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:29,482
So she does know how to smile.

581
00:41:32,882 --> 00:41:34,422
Does she have a cat?

582
00:41:35,852 --> 00:41:37,322
Here, kitty.

583
00:41:38,222 --> 00:41:39,822
Here, kitty.

584
00:41:40,822 --> 00:41:42,422
Here, kitty.

585
00:41:52,152 --> 00:41:53,292
She doesn't fit at all.

587
00:42:06,952 --> 00:42:08,552
Didn't I give it to you...

588
00:42:08,552 --> 00:42:10,182
for your parents' wedding anniversary?

(Family member, Seo Yoon Sook)

What's taking him so long?

591
00:42:52,752 --> 00:42:55,052
You could've just gone to work.

592
00:42:56,352 --> 00:42:58,382
How could I leave my home...

593
00:42:58,382 --> 00:42:59,922
with a trespasser inside?

594
00:43:00,852 --> 00:43:02,622
I'll repay you.

595
00:43:10,482 --> 00:43:14,152
I brought it in because I felt bad for it.

596
00:43:16,322 --> 00:43:18,022
It didn't die completely.

597
00:43:18,322 --> 00:43:19,422
Do you want it back?

598
00:43:19,422 --> 00:43:21,952
No. I don't need it.

599
00:43:23,382 --> 00:43:25,882
Look. Why are you so arrogant?

600
00:43:25,882 --> 00:43:27,252
Aren't you embarrassed?

601
00:43:27,252 --> 00:43:28,352
Don't you remember the post?

602
00:43:28,352 --> 00:43:29,352
So?

603
00:43:34,022 --> 00:43:35,452
Your code is 1234.

604
00:43:36,352 --> 00:43:37,552

Why did you do that?

608
00:44:27,222 --> 00:44:29,352
Why did you pay Yun Hee's tuition?

609
00:44:30,582 --> 00:44:34,452
Wow. Did you make all of this for me?

610
00:44:35,082 --> 00:44:36,422
You worked so hard.

611
00:44:36,422 --> 00:44:39,352
I'm just giving you some of what my family eats.

612
00:44:44,782 --> 00:44:47,052
Mom, did you throw away my book?

613
00:44:47,482 --> 00:44:49,822
I thought I could throw away...

614
00:44:49,822 --> 00:44:51,282
things you left behind.

615
00:44:51,282 --> 00:44:52,852
Why? Do you need it?

616
00:44:53,082 --> 00:44:56,252
I have to take that course again.

617
00:44:56,552 --> 00:44:58,382
Why did you throw it away without asking?

618
00:44:58,382 --> 00:45:01,682
How much is that book?

619
00:45:03,752 --> 00:45:06,122
- 50 dollars. - 50 dollars. Okay.

620

While you're at it,

621
00:45:08,682 --> 00:45:10,322
can you give me some spending money too?

622
00:45:10,322 --> 00:45:12,052
Why are you...

623
00:45:12,052 --> 00:45:14,322
What? I'm his little sister.

624

- Right? - Of course. Here.

625
00:45:17,222 --> 00:45:20,452
This is for my little sister since you live alone.

626
00:45:20,922 --> 00:45:23,952
And this is money for your trip next week.

Thank you. Yes!

Do you want to go too?

What? Really?

630
00:45:35,682 --> 00:45:36,882
I can go too? Really?

631
00:45:36,882 --> 00:45:39,322
Of course. Why not? You're family.

632
00:45:39,322 --> 00:45:42,022
Then the three of us should take a family picture.

633

I'll go now, Mom.

Hi, Mom.

637
00:45:59,482 --> 00:46:02,152
What? I brought the wrong containers?

638
00:46:03,582 --> 00:46:05,422
It's the same food anyway.

639
00:46:05,422 --> 00:46:06,882
That's true,

640

as soon as she finds a new place. Okay.

You won't find a place as nice and quiet as here.

Unit 705?

655
00:46:55,552 --> 00:46:58,082
Yes. His roommate moved out,

656
00:46:58,352 --> 00:47:00,282
so it's too big to live in alone.

657
00:47:00,282 --> 00:47:02,352
He said it's to lonely or something.

658
00:47:02,352 --> 00:47:03,922
Then I won't move.

It'll be Christmas soon.

Wait. Didn't you and your boyfriend fight about that?

I was wondering...

664
00:47:37,952 --> 00:47:40,382
Are you really cheating? You have another guy?

Stay out of it.

00:47:51,422 --> 00:47:52,882
I'm going away with my...

670
00:47:54,482 --> 00:47:55,922
My family.

671
00:47:58,152 --> 00:48:01,752
Hey. I told you not to touch my things.

672
00:48:02,152 --> 00:48:05,822
Well... I didn't mean to.

673
00:48:05,822 --> 00:48:07,852
It was all your fault.

674
00:48:08,852 --> 00:48:11,582
My parents are divorced too.

675
00:48:11,682 --> 00:48:13,952
Your family registry looked just like mine.

676
00:48:13,952 --> 00:48:15,152
That's why...

677
00:48:17,952 --> 00:48:21,052
So? Does other people's sadness amuse you?

678
00:48:22,352 --> 00:48:23,822
That's not it.

679
00:48:24,622 --> 00:48:27,252
It's just something we have in common.

680
00:48:27,952 --> 00:48:29,722
You had a cat too, right?

681
00:48:29,722 --> 00:48:31,022
So did I. Yang Soon...

682
00:48:36,582 --> 00:48:37,882
That's...

683
00:48:39,052 --> 00:48:42,552
I opened your drawer and happened to see...

684
00:48:42,952 --> 00:48:44,452
We have that in common too.

685
00:48:45,082 --> 00:48:47,082
I don't care whether your parents...

686
00:48:47,082 --> 00:48:48,852
got a divorce...

687
00:48:48,852 --> 00:48:50,552
or died in a car accident.

688
00:48:53,082 --> 00:48:56,222
Why did you lie to your ex-boyfriend?

689
00:48:56,222 --> 00:48:59,482
There's no need to announce your weakness to strangers.

690
00:48:59,782 --> 00:49:01,052
Not unless you're stupid.

691
00:49:01,052 --> 00:49:02,722
Is your boyfriend a stranger?

692
00:49:02,722 --> 00:49:04,052
Even married couples...

693
00:49:04,052 --> 00:49:06,082
become strangers to each other once they get divorced.

694
00:49:06,422 --> 00:49:07,952
Just like your parents.

695
00:49:09,522 --> 00:49:11,922
Why are you saying such hurtful things?

696
00:49:12,022 --> 00:49:13,922
What did I do that was so wrong?

697
00:49:14,322 --> 00:49:17,682
I just wanted to talk to you...

698
00:49:21,222 --> 00:49:23,452
When a murderer is standing there with a knife,

699
00:49:23,822 --> 00:49:25,552
who would just stay still?

700
00:49:26,022 --> 00:49:27,452
If I don't stab him first,

701
00:49:28,122 --> 00:49:29,382
I'll be the one stabbed.

702
00:49:31,252 --> 00:49:33,382
I told you not to, but you keep stabbing me.

703
00:49:34,682 --> 00:49:36,622
You don't care whether others are stabbed...

704
00:49:36,622 --> 00:49:39,122
as long as you're safe, right?

705
00:49:44,482 --> 00:49:46,052
Here's compensation for last time.

706
00:49:46,052 --> 00:49:48,552
Let's end our relationship here.

707
00:49:48,752 --> 00:49:49,782
Let's end it with this.

708
00:49:51,552 --> 00:49:52,552
Forget it.

709
00:49:58,252 --> 00:50:02,482
Hi, Mom. I'm shopping for stuff for the trip.

710
00:50:04,682 --> 00:50:05,682
What?

711
00:50:08,722 --> 00:50:09,822
I'm sorry.

712
00:50:10,252 --> 00:50:13,752
Yun Hee says she'll be uncomfortable with you there.

713
00:50:13,952 --> 00:50:15,482
Be understanding.

714
00:50:16,282 --> 00:50:17,852
Okay.

715
00:50:21,152 --> 00:50:23,882
Stop being so mean to your brother.

716
00:50:24,382 --> 00:50:26,122
Think of all he does for you.

717
00:50:26,122 --> 00:50:27,882
What? We don't share any blood.

718
00:50:28,422 --> 00:50:30,022
He can do that much after...

719
00:50:30,022 --> 00:50:32,252
being raised in our family where he doesn't belong.

720
00:50:34,922 --> 00:50:38,282
(Mom)

721
00:51:03,952 --> 00:51:07,222
Lovers, friends, and families taking family pictures...

722
00:51:07,222 --> 00:51:10,152
captured unforgettable moments on their cameras.

723
00:51:11,722 --> 00:51:13,052
In order to celebrate...

724
00:51:13,052 --> 00:51:15,322
Four days ago, during the deep freeze,

725
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:18,582
she passed away all alone in her small home.

726
00:51:31,252 --> 00:51:33,182
(Merry Christmas. What are you doing?)

727
00:51:33,182 --> 00:51:34,522
(Want to meet up?)

728
00:51:34,522 --> 00:51:36,522
If you're going to ignore me, don't read it.

729
00:51:37,122 --> 00:51:39,322
If you're going to read it, don't ignore me!

730
00:51:40,382 --> 00:51:42,222
Darn it. Jerks.

731
00:51:55,722 --> 00:51:57,182
Hi, Suk Joon.

732
00:51:58,082 --> 00:52:01,352
You must've heard about me.

733
00:52:01,352 --> 00:52:03,882
Hey, Byuk Soo. Yes, I heard.

734
00:52:03,882 --> 00:52:04,922
How are you holding up?

735
00:52:05,222 --> 00:52:07,082
- Are you alone? - Yes.

736
00:52:08,382 --> 00:52:09,522
Thanks.

737
00:52:10,682 --> 00:52:13,282
You were worried that I'd be alone today.

738
00:52:13,282 --> 00:52:17,182
Sorry, but can you do something for me?

739
00:52:17,582 --> 00:52:20,752
What? Sure.

740
00:52:21,152 --> 00:52:23,852
I have nothing to do anyway.

741
00:52:24,082 --> 00:52:26,352
My grad school professor...

742
00:52:26,352 --> 00:52:29,222
asked me to find some data for him.

743
00:52:44,952 --> 00:52:46,052
I...

744
00:52:46,352 --> 00:52:50,252
can't treat someone who isn't honest to herself.

745
00:53:08,052 --> 00:53:09,252
A family trip?

746
00:53:10,722 --> 00:53:12,182
He must be so happy.

747
00:53:38,152 --> 00:53:40,482
(Delete pictures.)

748
00:53:52,552 --> 00:53:54,352
Hi, it's Byuk Soo.

749
00:53:55,222 --> 00:53:57,182
No. I won't do it!

750
00:53:59,152 --> 00:54:02,422
Hey. You don't want to do it because it's Christmas.

751
00:54:02,422 --> 00:54:03,922
Do you think I would?

752
00:54:04,952 --> 00:54:09,582
And you call only when you have a favor to ask.

753
00:54:10,782 --> 00:54:13,822
Don't call for things like that again.

754
00:54:13,822 --> 00:54:17,382
The person you have reached is unavailable.

755
00:54:17,852 --> 00:54:20,922
Please leave a message after the tone.

756
00:55:00,252 --> 00:55:01,252
What?

757
00:55:02,222 --> 00:55:03,622
She didn't go out?

758
00:55:05,182 --> 00:55:06,622
Excuse me!

759
00:55:08,382 --> 00:55:10,252
Can you please stop?

760
00:55:13,882 --> 00:55:16,822
Darn it. Who cares?

761
00:55:23,252 --> 00:55:24,522
Did she die?

762
00:55:27,722 --> 00:55:29,582
She wouldn't die.

763
00:55:32,582 --> 00:55:33,922
Did she faint?

764
00:55:38,582 --> 00:55:39,682
Excuse me!

765
00:55:40,782 --> 00:55:41,882
Excuse me!

766
00:56:04,582 --> 00:56:07,752
Was it my idea? You're the one that didn't do it.

767
00:56:07,752 --> 00:56:10,722
- Don't blame me. - You mentioned it only once.

768
00:56:10,722 --> 00:56:11,852
You're so thoughtless...

769
00:56:11,852 --> 00:56:14,652
How could I ask you again when I don't see you?

770
00:56:14,782 --> 00:56:16,622
- You need to be home first. - Mommy.

771
00:56:16,682 --> 00:56:18,382
- As in you're not responsible? - Mommy.

772
00:56:18,382 --> 00:56:19,782
- Why are you so arrogant? - The kitten.

773
00:56:19,782 --> 00:56:21,882
Are you saying it's all my fault? Stop that!

774
00:56:22,122 --> 00:56:23,952
Cats are too annoying to raise.

775
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:25,582
There's no Santa.

776
00:56:26,122 --> 00:56:28,622
You start school next year, and you still believe that.

777
00:56:28,782 --> 00:56:30,482
Why are you so stupid?

778
00:56:32,622 --> 00:56:35,922
Santa gave me a dead cat as a gift,

779
00:56:37,252 --> 00:56:39,152
and in exchange,

780
00:56:39,952 --> 00:56:42,722
I cried like the worst kid on Earth.

781
00:56:43,352 --> 00:56:44,482
Ever since,

782
00:56:45,822 --> 00:56:49,552
there has never been a Santa on Christmas for me.

783
00:57:01,582 --> 00:57:04,182
You should raise her since she's a girl. That's best.

784
00:57:04,222 --> 00:57:06,182
I decide what's best or not.

785
00:57:06,182 --> 00:57:08,722
- I'm in no position to raise her! - What about me?

786
00:57:08,782 --> 00:57:11,382
- That great woman... - A child who's grown up...

787
00:57:12,052 --> 00:57:13,852
does not need adults.

788
00:57:15,352 --> 00:57:17,622
Just as Christmas is meaningless to a child...

789
00:57:18,682 --> 00:57:20,922
who doesn't believe in Santa Claus.

790
00:57:22,382 --> 00:57:24,522
No one needs to raise me.

791
00:57:25,652 --> 00:57:27,282
I'll live on my own.

792
00:57:28,322 --> 00:57:32,122
Like that, a child becomes an adult.

793
00:57:43,852 --> 00:57:45,782
To a child who became an adult,

794
00:57:46,522 --> 00:57:48,182
pity is insulting.

795
00:57:48,752 --> 00:57:51,382
A sign that you are not mature enough.

796
00:57:52,082 --> 00:57:54,452
A misconception that you are unstable alone.

797
00:57:55,022 --> 00:57:57,352
Prejudice that you are not fine.

798
00:57:57,952 --> 00:58:00,522
Today again, I hid my face...

799
00:58:01,522 --> 00:58:03,222
to avoid being pitied.

800
00:58:03,822 --> 00:58:06,952
Don't die. Don't die! I'm telling you! Don't die!

801
00:58:07,252 --> 00:58:08,952
Darn it.

802
00:58:17,652 --> 00:58:19,382
What are you doing here?

803
00:58:21,422 --> 00:58:22,952
It's Christmas.

804
00:58:34,582 --> 00:58:35,622
Are you okay?

805
00:58:38,882 --> 00:58:41,082
And what are you doing here?

806
00:58:43,022 --> 00:58:45,282
- It's Christmas. - You didn't go...

807
00:58:46,052 --> 00:58:47,422
on your family trip?

808
00:58:52,152 --> 00:58:53,952
A family trip on Christmas day?

809
00:58:55,352 --> 00:58:57,822
Forget it. I can't stand it.

810
00:59:00,922 --> 00:59:05,152
Still, it's better than being alone.

811
00:59:06,382 --> 00:59:09,052
Why didn't you change your code or put the chain on?

812
00:59:09,322 --> 00:59:10,582
That's not like you.

813
00:59:11,022 --> 00:59:13,952
Why do I make life so complicated?

814
00:59:15,822 --> 00:59:17,852
Why can't I be simple?

815
00:59:19,652 --> 00:59:20,782
That's what I wondered.

816
00:59:22,282 --> 00:59:25,582
Why do you hate me?

817
00:59:26,222 --> 00:59:28,222
It isn't just you.

818
00:59:29,552 --> 00:59:32,022
I hate everyone. That's just me.

819
00:59:32,182 --> 00:59:34,382
People hate me too.

820
00:59:38,552 --> 00:59:40,952
I'm sorry for hating you when you were nice to me.

821
00:59:42,922 --> 00:59:44,022
But you know,

822
00:59:45,182 --> 00:59:46,822
I'll keep being that way.

823
00:59:48,752 --> 00:59:49,822
Whatever.

824
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:54,782
I don't like you either.

825
00:59:58,482 --> 01:00:01,752
Anyway, why did you come in here?

826
01:00:14,622 --> 01:00:15,952
I was watching the news,

827
01:00:16,582 --> 01:00:18,552
and the streets were filled with people.

828
01:00:21,722 --> 01:00:23,722
There are so many people in the world,

829
01:00:25,382 --> 01:00:27,582
but I have no one to be with.

830
01:00:28,222 --> 01:00:29,552
It was too sad.

831
01:00:32,122 --> 01:00:33,922
I have hundreds of numbers in my phone...

832
01:00:35,522 --> 01:00:37,282
and thousands of followers, but...

833
01:00:38,122 --> 01:00:39,222
What?

834
01:00:39,852 --> 01:00:43,952
Don't people like you have a lot of friends?

835
01:00:44,752 --> 01:00:47,682
I worked hard all my life not to be alone,

836
01:00:48,182 --> 01:00:51,252
so why am I alone on a day like this?

837
01:00:51,882 --> 01:00:56,022
Doesn't everyone like people like you?

838
01:00:56,782 --> 01:01:00,422
Aren't you surrounded by love?

839
01:01:04,582 --> 01:01:07,122
For some, love is a given,

840
01:01:10,022 --> 01:01:11,352
but not me.

841
01:01:13,282 --> 01:01:15,582
It's not like people love you...

842
01:01:16,582 --> 01:01:20,182
just because you try hard to be loved.

843
01:01:22,382 --> 01:01:26,482
They use me because I'm easy. That's all.

844
01:01:26,782 --> 01:01:30,852
Still, your family must love you.

845
01:01:39,852 --> 01:01:41,152
I'm not their real son.

846
01:01:42,322 --> 01:01:43,722
I was adopted.

847
01:01:48,382 --> 01:01:50,022
They don't show it,

848
01:01:51,322 --> 01:01:52,952
but they discriminate subtly.

849
01:01:54,152 --> 01:01:55,752
That hurts a lot.

850
01:01:59,852 --> 01:02:02,022
But I have no right to get angry.

851
01:02:02,652 --> 01:02:03,952
Why can't you ask?

852
01:02:04,622 --> 01:02:05,782
Get angry.

853
01:02:06,482 --> 01:02:09,682
Why can't you ask why they do that to you?

854
01:02:10,522 --> 01:02:12,352
Because I don't want to be abandoned twice.

855
01:02:13,752 --> 01:02:15,422
I had my adoption dissolved once before.

856
01:02:18,082 --> 01:02:20,282
It wasn't your fault.

857
01:02:20,952 --> 01:02:23,122
The ones who abandoned you are the jerks.

858
01:02:28,552 --> 01:02:31,152
I did nothing wrong to them.

859
01:02:32,222 --> 01:02:33,752
I never hurt them.

860
01:02:33,752 --> 01:02:35,822
Just because you hurt people less,

861
01:02:36,422 --> 01:02:38,822
it doesn't mean you'll be hurt less.

862
01:02:39,882 --> 01:02:41,122
Are you stupid?

863
01:02:42,382 --> 01:02:44,152
What? Stupid...

864
01:02:46,322 --> 01:02:48,752
Why are you getting so worked up about my life?

865
01:02:48,752 --> 01:02:50,052
You're an individualist.

866
01:02:50,152 --> 01:02:53,652
Exactly. Why are you telling me about your life?

867
01:02:53,652 --> 01:02:57,652
Then what? Should we talk about work?

868
01:02:59,382 --> 01:03:01,422
Just give up as I have.

869
01:03:03,282 --> 01:03:05,152
Don't expect anything at all.

870
01:03:10,122 --> 01:03:11,722
I really want to know something.

871
01:03:15,552 --> 01:03:17,052
What if I give up?

872
01:03:18,822 --> 01:03:20,122
If I don't expect anything,

873
01:03:23,322 --> 01:03:24,382
will I not be lonely?

874
01:03:31,952 --> 01:03:33,022
Oops.

875
01:03:34,852 --> 01:03:37,352
Anyway, happy birthday.

876
01:03:38,422 --> 01:03:40,852
I noticed your unique birthday on the form.

877
01:03:44,652 --> 01:03:47,652
Do you want to come up here?

878
01:03:49,082 --> 01:03:50,082
Sorry?

879
01:03:51,552 --> 01:03:53,452
I'm going to leave.

880
01:03:54,422 --> 01:03:56,352
And that's a single. It's too tight.

881
01:03:57,622 --> 01:04:00,252
It isn't tight if we put them together.

882
01:04:04,322 --> 01:04:05,322
What?

883
01:04:08,282 --> 01:04:11,022
Do... Do you mean it?

884
01:04:14,082 --> 01:04:15,222
I mean it.

885
01:04:28,182 --> 01:04:31,352
(Individualist Ms. Ji Young)

886
01:04:32,052 --> 01:04:33,052
Ji Young.

887
01:04:33,322 --> 01:04:35,452
I don't like easy guys like you.

888
01:04:35,452 --> 01:04:36,652
Do you even like anything?

889
01:04:36,652 --> 01:04:37,652
Me.

890
01:04:38,182 --> 01:04:41,252
If you won't open your heart, I'll just barge in.
