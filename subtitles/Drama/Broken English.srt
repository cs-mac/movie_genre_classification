1
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,560
You guys? Sorry.
Um, I just want to

2
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,399
take a second

3
00:03:36,499 --> 00:03:40,003
to thank everybody for
coming out tonight

4
00:03:40,503 --> 00:03:43,496
to help us celebrate
our fifth wedding

5
00:03:43,596 --> 00:03:44,908
anniversary.

6
00:03:45,008 --> 00:03:48,622
It's not often that,
um, you meet the girl

7
00:03:48,722 --> 00:03:49,913
of your dreams,

8
00:03:50,013 --> 00:03:51,915
much less get a chance
to marry her.

9
00:03:52,015 --> 00:03:52,916
Guests: Aw.

10
00:03:53,016 --> 00:03:56,985
Marriage these days,
um, is-is-

11
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:00,010
as most of you know,
is not any easy thing

12
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:00,924
to get right.

13
00:04:01,024 --> 00:04:05,829
It takes love and humor
and attraction

14
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:09,359
and a real willingness
to really, really

15
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:10,734
let yourself

16
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:12,235
be seen by someone.

17
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:13,751
I know people who have
searched their

18
00:04:13,851 --> 00:04:14,237
whole lives

19
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:16,756
for what we have,
and I'm just glad

20
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:18,158
to have it with you.

21
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,526
I love you, Audrey.

22
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:21,578
Guests: oh. aw.

23
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:23,530
Happy anniversary.

24
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,031
Oh, and wait. Sorry.

25
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:27,709
I want to also thank
our good friend

26
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:28,535
Nora Wilder,

27
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:30,236
who introduced us,

28
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:33,723
and without her there
wouldn't be an 'us. '

29
00:04:34,224 --> 00:04:37,256
May there be many years
of celebration.

30
00:04:37,356 --> 00:04:39,129
Cheers, everybody.

31
00:04:39,229 --> 00:04:40,130
Guests: cheers.

32
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,632
When are you gonna give
us some grandchildren?

33
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,641
Hi.

34
00:04:51,741 --> 00:04:52,642
Oh, hi, baby.

35
00:04:52,742 --> 00:04:53,643
Hi, mom.

36
00:04:53,743 --> 00:04:54,644
You look lovely.

37
00:04:54,744 --> 00:04:56,744
Oh, thank you.
So do you.

38
00:04:56,746 --> 00:04:57,647
Give me a hug.

39
00:04:57,747 --> 00:04:59,749
Hi, Irving.
- Hi.

40
00:04:59,784 --> 00:05:00,650
How are you?

41
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,152
I'm gonna get you a drink.

42
00:05:02,252 --> 00:05:03,153
You want one?

43
00:05:03,253 --> 00:05:04,154
Uh, champagne.

44
00:05:04,254 --> 00:05:05,155
3 coming up.

45
00:05:05,255 --> 00:05:07,722
Thank you.

46
00:05:07,757 --> 00:05:11,261
Oh, I didn't mean
to embarrass you.

47
00:05:11,296 --> 00:05:12,479
Mom: I wish you would have

48
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:13,163
married Mark.

49
00:05:13,263 --> 00:05:14,164
Oh, mom.

50
00:05:14,264 --> 00:05:15,901
He was always so
crazy about you.

51
00:05:16,001 --> 00:05:16,666
You know that.

52
00:05:16,766 --> 00:05:18,168
It would have been perfect.

53
00:05:18,268 --> 00:05:19,169
Good family and friends.

54
00:05:19,269 --> 00:05:20,721
He's so handsome,

55
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,672
and he's successful

56
00:05:22,772 --> 00:05:25,775
he has a terrific trust fund.

57
00:05:26,276 --> 00:05:27,677
Audrey's never gonna have
to work again in her life

58
00:05:27,777 --> 00:05:30,745
if she doesn't feel like it.

59
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,183
You know, I don't know
why they haven't

60
00:05:33,283 --> 00:05:35,785
started a family yet, though.

61
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,785
It's really odd.

62
00:05:38,788 --> 00:05:41,191
You should never have
introduced them.

63
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:42,692
Audrey's my best friend.
Mark's my friend.

64
00:05:42,792 --> 00:05:44,694
They're really happy together.

65
00:05:44,794 --> 00:05:45,695
You know I love Audrey.

66
00:05:45,795 --> 00:05:47,197
She's practically part
of the family.

67
00:05:47,297 --> 00:05:49,764
I'm only saying that, you know,

68
00:05:49,799 --> 00:05:52,802
she knew a good thing
when she saw it.

69
00:05:54,304 --> 00:05:57,698
The good ones get snapped
up so quickly

70
00:05:57,798 --> 00:05:59,798
at your age.

71
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,175
Good afternoon.
Guest relations.

72
00:06:26,275 --> 00:06:27,053
This is Nora.

73
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:29,354
Oh, hi, Mr. Harris.
How are you?

74
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,791
I'm good, thanks.
How can I help you?

75
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:38,665
6 people at 8:00
tonight at Nouveau

76
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,365
might be a little tricky.

77
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:41,367
Is there a backup you'd like?

78
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:44,687
No? Well, let me try to work
some of my magic,

79
00:06:44,722 --> 00:06:47,173
and I'll call you back
with an answer.

80
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:49,225
You're welcome. Bye.

81
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:51,177
Your job is so weird.

82
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:53,277
No kidding.

83
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:56,999
Knock, knock, knock.

84
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:58,885
Hey, Glen. What's up?

85
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:00,486
You weren't answering
your phone,

86
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,620
and Mr. Gable is checking in,

87
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,557
and he's not happy
with his room,

88
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:06,469
and he's being really
high-maintenance

89
00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:06,960
about it,

90
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,161
and I don't know what
to do with him.

91
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,797
I'll take care of it.

92
00:07:10,832 --> 00:07:12,797
Oh, hey, Audrey.

93
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,140
Sorry. I could try another name.

94
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,240
Try Kurt Vonnegut.

95
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:26,429
I'm sorry.
There's nothing.

96
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:30,169
Well, what other name could
I have checked in under?

97
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,185
Try Walt Whitman.

98
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,102
It's not in here.

99
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:35,024
Mr. Gable?
I'm Nora Wilder,

100
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:36,847
manager of guest relations and

101
00:07:36,947 --> 00:07:37,857
special services.

102
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:38,858
Is there a problem?

103
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:39,859
Yeah, there is a problem.

104
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,861
I usually get a room on
the fifth floor.

105
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,863
My assistant or my manager
or someone screwed up,

106
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,648
and now it's apparently not there,

107
00:07:45,748 --> 00:07:48,510
and it's got, like,
arched windows,

108
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:49,452
wood floors.

109
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:50,954
Do you know what
I'm talking about?

110
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:51,684
Yeah. I thought there
might have been

111
00:07:51,784 --> 00:07:51,955
some mix-up.

112
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:53,126
The room you usually stay
in is occupied

113
00:07:53,226 --> 00:07:53,456
right now,

114
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:54,271
but I can show you something on

115
00:07:54,371 --> 00:07:54,741
the seventh floor

116
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:56,841
that's very similar.

117
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:57,961
All right.

118
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:58,962
Yeah?
- Yeah.

119
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:00,463
Great.

120
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:01,659
I don't want to seem like
a pain in the ass

121
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:02,215
or anything, but...

122
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,666
No. It's not a big deal.

123
00:08:03,766 --> 00:08:06,846
Yeah, well, he's making
me feel like a nazi.

124
00:08:08,271 --> 00:08:11,074
Yeah. We'll take care
of it right now.

125
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:15,793
Anyway...

126
00:08:15,845 --> 00:08:17,845
I hope this is good for you.

127
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,478
Yeah. Ok. This is good.
It's cool.

128
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,073
It's better light.
This one I can have?

129
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,173
Yeah.
- Good.

130
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:30,943
Great. Life is so much better.

131
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:32,662
I'll just get someone to
bring up your bags.

132
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,163
Oh, that'd be Rad.

133
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:35,665
Hey, thank you for
being so sweet.

134
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,166
No problem.

135
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:38,668
What do you do here?

136
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:43,272
You just deal with professional
complainers like me?

137
00:08:43,307 --> 00:08:45,351
I deal with V.I.P.s
and their needs

138
00:08:45,451 --> 00:08:46,009
and wants.

139
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:48,126
So I'm a V.I.P.

140
00:08:48,144 --> 00:08:50,144
Of course you are.

141
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,849
So if I need anything,
I can just ask you?

142
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,087
You can ask at the front desk

143
00:08:54,187 --> 00:08:54,834
or the concierge,

144
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:57,535
but I'm in charge of
all that stuff.

145
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,522
How come I've never seen
you here before?

146
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,297
I've taken care of
things for you

147
00:09:01,397 --> 00:09:01,974
in the past.

148
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:03,425
You just didn't know because
there's never

149
00:09:03,525 --> 00:09:03,976
been a problem.

150
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:06,479
Oh. Thanks.

151
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,879
Sure.

152
00:09:09,499 --> 00:09:10,975
Oh, shit.

153
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:12,452
What?

154
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,855
Can I ask you for
one little favor?

155
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,357
Sure.

156
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:19,557
Will you go to dinner with me?

157
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:23,596
Uh...

158
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:26,265
Or do they not let you
do that here?

159
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,554
Sure. I guess so.

160
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,654
Great.

161
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,908
How about tomorrow night?

162
00:09:35,943 --> 00:09:37,310
Yeah.

163
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,811
Sweet.

164
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,398
I'll just call down
and get someone

165
00:09:40,498 --> 00:09:41,414
to bring up your bags.

166
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:43,514
Ok.

167
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:46,936
Good afternoon.
Front desk.

168
00:09:47,036 --> 00:09:47,603
This is Glen.

169
00:09:47,703 --> 00:09:50,071
Hey, Glen.
Could you bring up Mr.

170
00:09:50,171 --> 00:09:51,607
Gable's bags, please?

171
00:09:51,707 --> 00:09:54,490
Woman on tv: Take
a big breath in

172
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,329
and exhale a big sigh.

173
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,431
Women on tv: Ahh.

174
00:09:58,931 --> 00:09:59,371
Did you have a good

175
00:09:59,471 --> 00:09:59,832
time the other night?

176
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:04,402
I guess. Mark did.

177
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:08,391
The whole Andrews family did.

178
00:10:08,426 --> 00:10:10,093
I'm so stupid.

179
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:12,095
I think I'm having
a personal crisis.

180
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:13,880
Woman on tv:... as you exhale,
begin to bend the knees.

181
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,733
A little bit of space
between your hands and thumb.

182
00:10:17,768 --> 00:10:18,608
I haven't slept without a drink

183
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:19,135
or sleeping pill

184
00:10:19,235 --> 00:10:20,486
since I can remember.

185
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:22,622
Join the club.

186
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:25,022
No, really.

187
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,861
I think my marriage
is falling apart.

188
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,062
You don't think it's just p. m.s.?

189
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:32,630
No. He's driving me nuts.

190
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:33,866
All he cares about is recognition

191
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,486
and going to parties
and winning awards,

192
00:10:36,586 --> 00:10:37,991
instead of just doing it because

193
00:10:38,091 --> 00:10:38,905
it makes him happy.

194
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:41,945
I mean, we used to laugh
about that stuff.

195
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,105
I'm sorry.

196
00:10:44,205 --> 00:10:45,912
It's just so depressing.

197
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:48,012
What's going on with you?

198
00:10:49,298 --> 00:10:50,700
I got asked out on a date.

199
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,267
You did? By who?

200
00:10:53,302 --> 00:10:56,680
This guy-Nick Gable,
that actor.

201
00:10:56,715 --> 00:11:00,059
He's the hitman.
He's in the hitman.

202
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,560
That Mr. Gable?

203
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:04,430
You're going out with
a hotel guest.

204
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,432
Are you allowed to
date hotel guests?

205
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:09,635
I don't know.
Do you think that's creepy?

206
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:10,361
Just don't sleep with him

207
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:10,970
on the first date.

208
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,271
Oh, no.

209
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:15,141
That would be so available.

210
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:17,271
I don't think it's like that.

211
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,519
Arigato.

212
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:36,379
Do you live in L.A.?

213
00:11:36,479 --> 00:11:38,648
Yeah. I hate it.

214
00:11:38,683 --> 00:11:39,549
Oh.

215
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:40,550
It's awful.

216
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,952
I mean, it's cool once you find

217
00:11:42,987 --> 00:11:44,581
your little coffee spots,

218
00:11:44,681 --> 00:11:45,638
Blah blah blah.

219
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:47,353
Anyway, I'm gonna be
here for, like,

220
00:11:47,453 --> 00:11:47,773
forever.

221
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,275
What are you working on?

222
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,780
I am working on a movie called

223
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,112
Rain Dancer,

224
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,283
where I play a medicine man,

225
00:11:55,383 --> 00:11:56,315
Anwahatu,

226
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:58,286
who's a member of the choctaw

227
00:11:58,386 --> 00:11:58,734
tribe.

228
00:11:58,834 --> 00:11:59,812
There's actually a whole tribe of

229
00:11:59,912 --> 00:12:00,236
medicine men

230
00:12:00,336 --> 00:12:01,482
that used to basically

231
00:12:01,582 --> 00:12:02,238
travel around

232
00:12:02,338 --> 00:12:04,040
sort of poisoning
the European settlers.

233
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:04,991
Oh, my god.

234
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:06,225
Yeah, I know.

235
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:07,827
He's kind of a villain, I guess.

236
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:09,562
Do you like playing bad guys?

237
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:11,330
Yeah. You know,
it would be nice

238
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:12,401
to take a shot for leading man

239
00:12:12,501 --> 00:12:13,132
every now and again.

240
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,834
Mm-hmm.

241
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:16,836
Don't want to get pigeonholed.

242
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:19,438
I mean, I'm grateful for working.

243
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:21,340
That's so cool.

244
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,241
Thanks.

245
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:25,895
How about you?

246
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,346
Are you interested
in the hotel biz?

247
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:30,049
Yeah. Uh, I've been
working at the hotel

248
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:32,529
for about 6 years,
since it opened.

249
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:36,046
Oh, my god. 6 years.
That's, like,

250
00:12:36,146 --> 00:12:36,856
forever.

251
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:38,457
It's awesome.

252
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:40,349
So is there, like,
a hotel school

253
00:12:40,449 --> 00:12:40,860
for that

254
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,727
or something?

255
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:49,201
No. um, I went to Sarah Lawrence.

256
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:51,201
Oh. Sarah Lawrence.

257
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:52,755
I got a liberal arts degree,

258
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:54,307
and I was an arts major there.

259
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:57,487
I thought I'd do something
in the art world.

260
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,680
So now you do just hotel stuff,

261
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,014
which is cool.

262
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,114
Yeah.
- Yeah.

263
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:06,757
I mean, you can't just say you're

264
00:13:06,857 --> 00:13:07,620
gonna be an actor.

265
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,888
You know, you've got to, like,

266
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:10,523
really dedicate yourself to it.

267
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,025
You've got to, like,
go to school for it.

268
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,527
You can't just walk in and do it.

269
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,028
You got to study,
you know?

270
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,731
I studied for...
6 months.

271
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:20,631
I did, like,
this intensive thing

272
00:13:20,731 --> 00:13:21,534
on 'Melrose Place'

273
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,581
where you just,
from 10:00 to 3:00

274
00:13:23,681 --> 00:13:24,236
every day,

275
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:25,738
you're in there just
doing monologues

276
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:27,239
and doing scenes from tv shows,

277
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:28,741
and it's unbelievable.

278
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:30,242
It's hard work.

279
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:31,394
Yeah. Of course,
I think I'm gonna

280
00:13:31,494 --> 00:13:31,744
just walk

281
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:33,245
into some casting
director's office

282
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:34,730
when I graduate

283
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:35,853
and, you know,
just get some big

284
00:13:35,953 --> 00:13:36,215
huge role

285
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,216
and become a big star.

286
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,352
Oh, definitely.
I know what you mean.

287
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:41,452
Hey, when I was much younger,

288
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,089
I thought that I would be married,

289
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:45,841
I'd have kids, you know,
by the time I was 30

290
00:13:45,941 --> 00:13:48,828
and I'd have the exact
career that I wanted.

291
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:51,448
I still don't know what
I want to be

292
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:53,498
when I grow up.

293
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:57,803
I'm so glad I met you.

294
00:13:57,838 --> 00:13:59,305
Me, too.

295
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:01,071
No, I'm serious.
I think you're

296
00:14:01,171 --> 00:14:02,208
totally refreshing.

297
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:06,110
Yeah.

298
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:08,665
What do you say,
we get out of here?

299
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:11,053
You know what...

300
00:14:11,153 --> 00:14:11,917
says about...?

301
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:15,020
that 3 are too many and
one is not enough.

302
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:15,721
Who says that?

303
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:17,990
Hefner. Hugh Hefner.

304
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:20,926
The guy should talk.

305
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,662
He's only got 19 girlfriends.

306
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:31,602
Do you know how pretty you are?

307
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:33,723
Thank you. I think that
you're really cute

308
00:14:33,823 --> 00:14:35,808
and that you're a really good actor

309
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:38,918
and that you're gonna
be really successful.

310
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:40,613
I think so, too,

311
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,713
about you.

312
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:54,994
I'm sorry.

313
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:58,796
Why? Why?

314
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:00,831
I should have asked you if I

315
00:15:00,841 --> 00:15:02,251
should kiss you.

316
00:15:02,351 --> 00:15:03,883
Oh, don't worry

317
00:15:03,983 --> 00:15:04,503
about it.

318
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:07,072
I'm the special services director,

319
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:10,400
and I want you to know
that I don't just

320
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,211
go around kissing guests.

321
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:16,816
Do you know you are a V.I.P.?

322
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,417
Thank you.

323
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:28,427
Mmm.

324
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:30,527
Mmm.

325
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:48,478
Fuck.

326
00:16:31,891 --> 00:16:33,392
Look who's here-Nora.

327
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,393
Oh, my goodness.

328
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,796
Hey, darling.
Come on in.

329
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,149
You remember Eleanor, don't you?

330
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,150
Nora.

331
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,217
Of course.
How are you?

332
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,669
Sit down, Nora.
I'll get you

333
00:16:44,769 --> 00:16:45,154
a drink.

334
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:49,758
We've just been bragging
about your glamorous life.

335
00:16:49,793 --> 00:16:50,659
You remember Bill,
don't you?

336
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,161
Hello, Nora.
It's good to see you.

337
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:55,229
You, too. You, too.

338
00:16:55,264 --> 00:17:00,977
So is it just exciting,
running that little

339
00:17:01,077 --> 00:17:03,772
chic hotel of yours?

340
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,675
Well, I don't actually run it, but-

341
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:07,676
Mom: Oh, sure, she does.

342
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:09,178
She does everything over there.

343
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,680
She plans all their parties,
all of the special events.

344
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,533
They're a pretty spoiled group.

345
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,802
That's my job.

346
00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:19,003
Nora.

347
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,038
Do you have someone special?

348
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,658
Well, uh, actually,
I have started

349
00:17:25,758 --> 00:17:26,745
to see someone.

350
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:29,715
He's, um-he's an actor.

351
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,816
Anyone we know?

352
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,485
His name is Nick Gable.
He's in The Hitman.

353
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:34,703
Oh, we just saw that last week.

354
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:36,488
It was terrific.

355
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:37,423
I loved that movie.

356
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:41,393
Really? - Yeah.
He's the hitman.

357
00:17:41,428 --> 00:17:42,294
Well, that's wonderful.

358
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:43,929
Well, why don't you
invite him over?

359
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:45,798
We would just love to meet him.

360
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,911
You know, we could
have maybe a little

361
00:17:48,011 --> 00:17:48,667
dinner party.

362
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:49,668
That would be great.

363
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:50,536
Let's have a toast to celebrate

364
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:52,788
Nora having a new boyfriend.

365
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:55,706
Hey-Nick and Nora.

366
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:57,726
Oh, you're dating yourself.

367
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,827
A little bit.

368
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,784
Who's that?

369
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:09,421
I don't know.
Lisa someone.

370
00:18:09,456 --> 00:18:12,024
Some tv actress.
She scares me.

371
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:15,227
She's so tacky.
Look at those lips.

372
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:17,020
It's the only part of her face

373
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:17,930
that can move.

374
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,531
What an idiot.

375
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:20,402
You two are the most
judgmental people

376
00:18:20,502 --> 00:18:20,733
in the world.

377
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,535
Who watches these stupid
entertainment shows?

378
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:25,137
It's better than watching the news.

379
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:27,237
Propaganda nightmare.

380
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,527
Oh, look. Turn it up.

381
00:18:31,562 --> 00:18:33,994
Oh.

382
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,781
People wonder what's inside the mind

383
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:36,982
of a hitman.

384
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:38,744
You know,
these guys are sick,

385
00:18:38,844 --> 00:18:39,385
sick guys.

386
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:41,325
You know, as a result, they spend

387
00:18:41,425 --> 00:18:42,521
a lot of time alone,

388
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,618
so most of my scenes were shot virtually

389
00:18:45,718 --> 00:18:47,493
by myself, you know.

390
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:49,495
I think I'm gonna be ok, though.

391
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:50,696
Ooh.

392
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,397
Woman on tv: Don't feel too sorry

393
00:18:52,497 --> 00:18:53,098
for this guy.

394
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:55,164
He's been dating his sexyhitmancostar

395
00:18:55,264 --> 00:18:55,868
Serena Hill.

396
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,002
Serena. Oh, god.

397
00:18:58,037 --> 00:18:59,138
Oh, Serena-she's a great woman.

398
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:02,040
She's totally refreshing,

399
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,843
and, uh, I'm crazy about her.

400
00:19:04,878 --> 00:19:06,810
What else can I say?

401
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:08,347
That's probably all I should say,

402
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:10,447
you know what I'm saying?

403
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:14,753
What is wrong with me?

404
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:15,955
Why can't I meet someone nice?

405
00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:17,111
There's nothing wrong with you,

406
00:19:17,211 --> 00:19:17,339
Nora.

407
00:19:17,439 --> 00:19:18,702
You just go out with the wrong

408
00:19:18,802 --> 00:19:19,058
people.

409
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,693
Stop dating actors.
They're crazy.

410
00:19:21,728 --> 00:19:23,693
No, that's actresses.

411
00:19:23,796 --> 00:19:26,098
I shouldn't go out with anyone anymore.

412
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:28,198
I'm going home.

413
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,004
Hey, don't feel bad.
That guy's a jerk.

414
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:32,905
I love you.

415
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,773
Me, too.

416
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:36,191
Ok, I'll call you.

417
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:38,291
Ok.

418
00:19:41,797 --> 00:19:42,698
Oh, god.

419
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:44,330
Poor Nora.
She has the worst

420
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:45,200
time with men.

421
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,201
You know,
I love Nora,

422
00:19:46,301 --> 00:19:47,229
but she has no insight when it

423
00:19:47,329 --> 00:19:47,703
comes to men.

424
00:19:47,803 --> 00:19:49,204
She doesn't understand the hunt.

425
00:19:49,304 --> 00:19:50,706
Men like a challenge.

426
00:19:50,806 --> 00:19:52,808
Like a bitch,
like me?

427
00:19:56,812 --> 00:19:58,130
Kinda.

428
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,515
You think I'm a bitch?

429
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,957
Come on, baby.
Don't fight me

430
00:20:02,057 --> 00:20:03,018
all the time.

431
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,520
I think you're great.
I worship you.

432
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,622
I put you on a pedestal.

433
00:20:06,657 --> 00:20:08,023
Like an object.

434
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:10,123
Shut up.

435
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:40,739
Honey, do you feel all right?

436
00:20:40,774 --> 00:20:41,974
You look pale.

437
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,208
I'm ok.

438
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,170
You don't think you should see

439
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:46,945
the doctor?

440
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:48,180
No. No. I'm fine.
Really.

441
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,848
Thank you, though.

442
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:51,050
I've just been working too hard

443
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:54,099
and just drinking too much, smoking

444
00:20:54,199 --> 00:20:54,820
too much.

445
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,539
You know what I heard about your liver?

446
00:20:57,823 --> 00:21:00,159
You should not have anything to drink

447
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,827
two days a week.

448
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,307
They don't have to be consecutive.

449
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:08,534
and of course you know smoking is suicide.

450
00:21:08,569 --> 00:21:10,534
Mm-hmm.

451
00:21:10,719 --> 00:21:13,689
How are things with your boyfriend?

452
00:21:13,724 --> 00:21:15,689
Oh, it's over.

453
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,494
Oh, is that why you're depressed?

454
00:21:23,498 --> 00:21:26,867
No, that's not it.

455
00:21:26,902 --> 00:21:27,854
I just feel like I have the worst

456
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:28,420
luck in the world

457
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,589
when it comes to men.

458
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:36,526
I think I must be doing something

459
00:21:36,626 --> 00:21:37,463
horribly wrong,

460
00:21:37,563 --> 00:21:39,965
but I don't know what it is.

461
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:41,867
What happened?

462
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:45,103
Oh, he has a girlfriend.

463
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:47,103
Oh.

464
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:51,808
You know, I can't quit thinking about

465
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:55,689
how hard it must be for young women nowadays.

466
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:59,535
I mean, on the one hand,
the world is wide open

467
00:21:59,585 --> 00:22:00,052
to you.

468
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,253
All the choices you want.

469
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:03,655
I think there are too many choices, really.

470
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:06,658
It just must be very confusing

471
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:09,761
to try to find a path through all of that,

472
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:12,229
especially with men,

473
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:15,717
though you have had some very nice boyfriends.

474
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:18,635
I know...

475
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,672
but that was college.

476
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:24,309
I don't know what happened.

477
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,915
I feel so closed off,

478
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:32,972
so desperate to find someone to love.

479
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:34,536
Oh, honey.

480
00:22:34,636 --> 00:22:36,396
Even I can't stand the sight of

481
00:22:36,496 --> 00:22:37,556
my own desperation.

482
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:40,459
Honey, hey,
you know what?

483
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:42,558
You're in a funk,
that's all,

484
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:44,224
and there's only one way to get

485
00:22:44,324 --> 00:22:44,897
out of a funk,

486
00:22:44,997 --> 00:22:46,498
and that is to engage.

487
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:48,781
Even if you don't feel like it,

488
00:22:48,881 --> 00:22:49,668
just fake it.

489
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:52,554
Just go out and get the highest heels in town

490
00:22:52,654 --> 00:22:54,857
and some new lipstick and go everyplace.

491
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,198
Smile. Act like you're having the time

492
00:22:58,298 --> 00:22:58,861
of your life.

493
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:01,613
But don't always go with married couples.

494
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:04,513
You're never gonna meet anyone that way.

495
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:08,584
Sure. I'll give it a try, you know.

496
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,659
You know...

497
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:15,561
I could fix you up.

498
00:23:15,661 --> 00:23:16,378
No.

499
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,998
Now, just listen to me for a minute.

500
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:20,866
You know Megan Ross,
my friend.

501
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:22,292
She has a son.
I don't think you've

502
00:23:22,392 --> 00:23:22,868
ever met him.

503
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:26,171
Nice-looking,
successful,

504
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:29,812
and I know he's not seeing anyone

505
00:23:29,912 --> 00:23:31,260
right now.

506
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,261
Are you Nora?

507
00:23:32,361 --> 00:23:33,262
Yes.

508
00:23:33,362 --> 00:23:34,263
I'm Charlie Ross.

509
00:23:34,363 --> 00:23:35,264
Hi.
- Hi.

510
00:23:35,364 --> 00:23:38,103
Nice to meet you.
- You, too.

511
00:23:38,138 --> 00:23:40,843
It's pretty funny that our moms

512
00:23:40,943 --> 00:23:41,770
set us up.

513
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:44,623
You don't know the irony behind it.

514
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,149
I'm glad.

515
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,259
Me, too.

516
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:53,928
I haven't seen this movie in a really

517
00:23:54,028 --> 00:23:54,333
long time.

518
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:55,834
It's one of my favorite films.

519
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,836
Yeah? No, I love this film, too.

520
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:58,837
I've never seen it in a theater, though.

521
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:01,405
Really?
- Yeah.

522
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,559
Uh, should we go in and get seats?

523
00:24:04,594 --> 00:24:06,559
Yeah.

524
00:24:11,566 --> 00:24:15,218
Yesterday,
about 3 p. m.

525
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:17,556
I wanted you to think about it twice, too.

526
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:27,656
I've been looking for someone for

527
00:24:27,706 --> 00:24:29,706
a long time.

528
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:32,321
I love that movie.

529
00:24:32,421 --> 00:24:34,172
It really holds up.

530
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:37,225
Bogart reminds me of my dad.

531
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,627
I met your dad once.

532
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,729
He seemed like a great guy.

533
00:24:40,764 --> 00:24:41,630
I'm sorry about him.

534
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,733
Yeah, me, too.
I really miss him.

535
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:47,636
I feel lucky to have had him at all, really.

536
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:50,606
Now my mom has Irving,
so she's not alone.

537
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:54,052
Yeah. My mom doesn't really date anyone

538
00:24:54,152 --> 00:24:54,643
anymore.

539
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:55,644
She went through a string of them

540
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:56,962
after my parents divorced,

541
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:59,464
but she always drives them away,

542
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:02,215
on purpose, I think.

543
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:05,170
I wonder if we always turn into our parents.

544
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:07,863
I like to think of it as where my

545
00:25:07,963 --> 00:25:09,174
parents left off.

546
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:11,584
That's a great way of putting it.

547
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:17,049
Oh, shit.

548
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:18,333
What?

549
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:18,999
Uh, nothing.
It's just my ex,

550
00:25:19,099 --> 00:25:19,334
Jennifer.

551
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:20,335
She's totally crazy.

552
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:21,336
Is it gonna be ok?

553
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:22,337
Hi, Jennifer.

554
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:23,338
Hello, Charlie.

555
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:24,840
How are you?
This is Nora.

556
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,825
'How are you?' How am I?

557
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:27,684
I'm fucking great, Charlie.

558
00:25:27,784 --> 00:25:28,093
How are you?

559
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,594
And Nora?

560
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:30,595
We're good.
We're good.

561
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,097
We just went to the movies.

562
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:34,599
He took you to see an old romantic movie.

563
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:35,901
It's his signature move, you know.

564
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:37,185
My mom was-

565
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:39,187
Can I talk to you for a minute?

566
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:40,689
Will you excuse me for one second?

567
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:42,190
I'm sorry.

568
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,191
Charlie: Why are you doing this?

569
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:44,192
Jennifer: What are you doing here?

570
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:45,143
What do you mean-

571
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:46,345
I just talked to you this morning.

572
00:25:46,445 --> 00:25:47,229
You said you weren't dating anybody.

573
00:25:47,329 --> 00:25:48,580
Charlie: I'm not dating anybody.

574
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,449
She's the daughter of my mom's friend.

575
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:53,385
I think I brought her here because I...

576
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:55,320
I was missing you,
and this reminded me

577
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,121
of our first date.

578
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:58,973
Don't touch me.

579
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,726
Hey, we're leaving.

580
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,416
Are you ok?

581
00:26:07,516 --> 00:26:08,417
Look, I'm so sorry you had to see that.

582
00:26:08,517 --> 00:26:10,984
What happened?

583
00:26:11,019 --> 00:26:12,421
We haven't been broken up that long.

584
00:26:12,521 --> 00:26:16,239
It's-it's been really hard.

585
00:26:16,274 --> 00:26:20,418
You're actually the first person I've

586
00:26:20,518 --> 00:26:22,848
dated since Jennifer.

587
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,750
I think I'm still in love with her.

588
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:27,556
I'm-I'm so sorry.
This was-it was

589
00:26:27,656 --> 00:26:29,656
too soon.

590
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:34,259
Um, you know, I think I'm just gonna go.

591
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:37,562
I'm just so, you know,
out of it.

592
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:39,965
Is it ok if I just put you in a cab?

593
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:42,065
Yeah.

594
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:47,472
I'm really sorry.
You're so nice.

595
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:05,989
Men hate me.

596
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:07,626
You hate yourself.

597
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:09,361
No, I don't.
Why do you say that?

598
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,242
You've got to stop punishing yourself

599
00:27:10,342 --> 00:27:10,562
all the time

600
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:12,013
for not having a boyfriend.

601
00:27:12,113 --> 00:27:13,398
Everyone else is in a relationship.

602
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:15,000
Why can't I be in one?

603
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,507
You'll meet someone.
Just don't go nuts

604
00:27:17,607 --> 00:27:18,203
next time.

605
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,228
It's like the only thing that matters

606
00:27:19,328 --> 00:27:19,805
is finding this guy.

607
00:27:19,905 --> 00:27:21,706
It doesn't even matter who it is.

608
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,109
Not every guy you meet has to be your

609
00:27:23,209 --> 00:27:23,708
future husband.

610
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,310
Believe me.
Do something else.

611
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:26,711
Go to yoga or something.

612
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,680
You're right.
I'm being a total

613
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:29,114
freak.

614
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:30,315
I have to calm down.

615
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:32,021
I love you.
I don't like to

616
00:27:32,121 --> 00:27:33,218
see you like this.

617
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:36,855
Oh, god. One minute.

618
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:38,857
Yeah. Uh-huh.

619
00:27:38,892 --> 00:27:42,042
Ok.

620
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,478
It's Mark. He'll be here in two minutes.

621
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:44,763
Where was he?

622
00:27:44,863 --> 00:27:48,233
Mmm. Having a meeting with
that actress Caitlin Fox.

623
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,034
Oh, no.

624
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:50,268
Yeah. She wants him to direct her

625
00:27:50,368 --> 00:27:52,020
in a movie about fairies.

626
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,321
Barf.

627
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:55,421
I know.

628
00:27:56,374 --> 00:27:58,677
I don't want to sound like a broken record.

629
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:00,970
I just feel like we're not best friends

630
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:01,480
anymore.

631
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,681
Do you talk about it?

632
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:04,282
Yeah, we have been.

633
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:05,944
He thinks everything is fine and that I'm

634
00:28:06,044 --> 00:28:06,701
just freaking out.

635
00:28:06,801 --> 00:28:08,114
I swear, if he blames it on my hormones

636
00:28:08,214 --> 00:28:08,653
one more time,

637
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:10,255
I'm gonna lose it.

638
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:13,291
He's the one who's hesitant about having kids.

639
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:15,391
Really?

640
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:18,430
I didn't know that.

641
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,777
Yeah, whatever.
I don't want to

642
00:28:19,877 --> 00:28:20,432
talk about it.

643
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,532
Let's just drop it.

644
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:25,905
But I can't believe you're not coming

645
00:28:26,005 --> 00:28:26,438
to Miami with us.

646
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,106
Please come.
Mark will pay.

647
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,206
I just don't feel like it.

648
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,208
I just want to stay here.

649
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:35,380
Ladies. I'm doing the fairy movie.

650
00:28:43,838 --> 00:28:45,240
Woman on tv: I'm Jill Scott.

651
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,861
Hamburgers and hot dogs are a standard for

652
00:28:46,961 --> 00:28:47,659
july fourth weekend,

653
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:49,411
but if you're looking to
spice up your holiday...

654
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:52,264
Joining me now with some new ideas of things

655
00:28:52,364 --> 00:28:53,980
you can cook on the grill
is Anita Lowe from Anita's

656
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:54,382
restaurant.

657
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:56,001
Hi, Anita. How are you?

658
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:56,633
Answering machine:

659
00:28:56,733 --> 00:28:57,602
Hi, it's Nora. Leave a message

660
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:00,972
Hey, Nora, it's Glen from work,

661
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:03,008
and I got my party saturday night,

662
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:05,010
and I want to make sure you know about it.

663
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,611
I left a flier in your mailbox

664
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:09,946
and also stuck one in your purse.

665
00:29:09,981 --> 00:29:13,251
It's gonna be great,
so hope to see you.

666
00:29:13,286 --> 00:29:14,069
Bye!

667
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:17,541
Anita on tv: This is a Japanese version of

668
00:29:17,641 --> 00:29:18,073
buffalo chicken wings.

669
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:21,603
They're marinated with a good...

670
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:23,710
which is a Japanese...

671
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:55,527
Glen on voicemail: Hey, Nora. It's Glen.

672
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,236
I think I called you already.

673
00:29:57,336 --> 00:29:58,029
I'm not sure.

674
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:00,229
I'm just taking a head count-

675
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:38,603
Nora.

676
00:30:38,703 --> 00:30:39,604
Hi.

677
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:41,706
Oh, my god.
What a surprise.

678
00:30:41,741 --> 00:30:43,108
Wow. You look great.

679
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:45,710
Thank you.

680
00:30:45,745 --> 00:30:48,178
Wow. Jeez.

681
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:49,491
I was beginning to feel like the last

682
00:30:49,591 --> 00:30:50,115
person on earth,

683
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:52,533
so I thought I'd come by.

684
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,851
Well, this is the place.

685
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:55,754
It's a nice place,
Glen.

686
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:56,899
Oh, thanks.

687
00:30:56,999 --> 00:30:58,256
I just can't believe

688
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,257
that you're not out of town.

689
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,259
I just didn't feel like it this year.

690
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:04,362
Oh. Well, I'm glad that you're here.

691
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,264
Hey, uh, I'll get you a drink,

692
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,516
and I'll introduce you to some people.

693
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:10,618
This is, um, uh...

694
00:31:10,653 --> 00:31:12,888
Carl.

695
00:31:12,923 --> 00:31:15,123
Hi.

696
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:17,590
You're kind of pretty.

697
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:19,527
Do you, uh-do you work with Glen?

698
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:21,629
Yeah.

699
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,031
Hotel business?

700
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:25,633
Mm-hmm. I have to get my drink.

701
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:29,635
Hot.

702
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:35,608
It's a fine day

703
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:38,646
to escape from a bad dream...

704
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:47,150
Hi. There you are.
Are you having

705
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:48,556
a good time?

706
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:51,159
Yeah. I'm exhausted.

707
00:31:51,194 --> 00:31:52,560
Really?

708
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,561
I'm gonna go.

709
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:54,562
Really?

710
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:55,563
Yeah.

711
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:56,564
Oh, come on. Stay.
Have one drink.

712
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:57,565
I'm so tired.

713
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:58,566
Please? With me.

714
00:31:58,666 --> 00:31:59,651
You know, we never get a chance

715
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:00,068
to do this.

716
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:03,171
I know. Thank you so much for inviting me.

717
00:32:03,206 --> 00:32:05,673
I'm so glad that you came.

718
00:32:05,708 --> 00:32:06,547
Are you sure you

719
00:32:06,647 --> 00:32:07,575
don't want to stay?

720
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:09,077
Come on.
It'll be fun.

721
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:11,079
Please? Just one little drink.

722
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,080
Hey.

723
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,081
Julian!

724
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:15,183
Common ça va? Salut!

725
00:32:15,218 --> 00:32:17,150
Hey, Nora, Nora.

726
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,586
Julian, I want you to meet someone.

727
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:21,189
Nora, this is Julian.

728
00:32:21,224 --> 00:32:22,090
Hello, Nora.

729
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,591
Hi.

730
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:25,692
Is this your fiancee?

731
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:27,693
No. We work together.

732
00:32:27,896 --> 00:32:30,799
Oh. cool. Would you have another drink with me?

733
00:32:30,899 --> 00:32:32,300
Nora has got to leave.

734
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,443
No! Why? Why are you leaving?

735
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:35,810
I'm tired.
I'm exhausted.

736
00:32:35,845 --> 00:32:37,135
It was nice meeting you,

737
00:32:37,235 --> 00:32:37,388
though.

738
00:32:37,488 --> 00:32:38,939
What are you doing?

739
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:40,391
Convincing you to stay.

740
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:43,494
Come on,
for just one drink.

741
00:32:43,529 --> 00:32:45,494
Please.

742
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,500
Ok.

743
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:54,455
Glen: Ha ha ha!
Mon ami.

744
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:56,407
How do you know this guy?

745
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:57,408
Well, I lived for a year

746
00:32:57,508 --> 00:32:58,910
with his family in France.

747
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:01,010
It's a long story.

748
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:09,708
So, um, can I get you guys a drink?

749
00:33:09,743 --> 00:33:12,398
Yeah. I'll have a vodka straight up

750
00:33:12,498 --> 00:33:13,374
with a twist.

751
00:33:13,474 --> 00:33:15,474
Ooh. Et Julian?

752
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:17,927
Yeah, I'll have the same.

753
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:18,763
Ok.

754
00:33:18,863 --> 00:33:20,498
Common ça va?

755
00:33:20,598 --> 00:33:22,183
Yeah, say va.

756
00:33:22,283 --> 00:33:25,403
You know,
I saw you before.

757
00:33:25,438 --> 00:33:26,905
Really? Where?

758
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,005
In a hotel.

759
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,597
You were with a man who had a pillow.

760
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:36,212
Oh, yeah.

761
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:39,267
Hi.

762
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:54,999
You don't speak French?

763
00:33:55,099 --> 00:33:57,200
No.

764
00:33:57,235 --> 00:33:58,898
A little in high school,

765
00:33:58,998 --> 00:34:00,205
but no, not really.

766
00:34:00,305 --> 00:34:03,908
Tu es très jolie,
Nora.

767
00:34:03,943 --> 00:34:05,908
Thanks.

768
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:08,077
You don't believe me?

769
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:09,447
No, I believe you.

770
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:12,094
I just don't think you're probably

771
00:34:12,194 --> 00:34:12,884
that picky.

772
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:14,986
I don't understand.

773
00:34:15,021 --> 00:34:16,821
Forget it.

774
00:34:16,921 --> 00:34:18,323
I'm glad you are here.

775
00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:20,446
One more minute,
and we would have

776
00:34:20,546 --> 00:34:21,626
missed each other.

777
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:25,396
It's fate to see you again, don't you think?

778
00:34:25,431 --> 00:34:27,414
Why do you laugh?

779
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:29,398
You are afraid?

780
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:33,639
You know, your approach is just

781
00:34:33,689 --> 00:34:35,689
really intense.

782
00:34:39,861 --> 00:34:41,262
Do you want another drink?

783
00:34:41,362 --> 00:34:43,362
Yeah.

784
00:34:51,372 --> 00:34:52,273
Oh.

785
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:10,108
So, what are you doing in New York?

786
00:35:10,143 --> 00:35:12,977
I came here to meet you.

787
00:35:13,012 --> 00:35:14,078
No. Really.

788
00:35:14,178 --> 00:35:15,290
No, really,
I came here to do

789
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:15,713
some work

790
00:35:15,813 --> 00:35:17,957
on a project,
on a film.

791
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,101
You're not an actor, are you?

792
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:20,919
No.

793
00:35:21,019 --> 00:35:23,019
Good.

794
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:27,692
You know, once you're calm,

795
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,794
you're not that bad.

796
00:35:29,829 --> 00:35:30,695
Why?

797
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:31,696
Why what?

798
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,197
Why was I bad?

799
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,199
No, I'm saying that you're not bad.

800
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:37,299
Oh. Cool.

801
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,804
Let's go somewhere.

802
00:35:43,674 --> 00:35:44,575
I don't think so.

803
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:46,675
Why not?

804
00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:49,080
I'm not looking for anything.

805
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:49,948
Like what?

806
00:35:50,048 --> 00:35:50,882
Trouble.

807
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:53,600
Trouble?
I'm no trouble.

808
00:35:54,218 --> 00:35:56,218
I'm not looking for trouble.

809
00:36:01,025 --> 00:36:03,025
Where do you want to go?

810
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:08,066
Show me something.

811
00:36:08,101 --> 00:36:09,167
Like what?

812
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:12,170
I don't know.
Something...

813
00:36:12,205 --> 00:36:14,170
very New York.

814
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,758
No.

815
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,825
What?

816
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:39,363
I don't want you to kiss me.

817
00:36:39,398 --> 00:36:40,264
I told you no.

818
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:42,364
Why?

819
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:43,267
Oh.

820
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:44,769
But I just want to kiss you.

821
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,869
No.

822
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:48,773
No.

823
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:49,774
Come on.

824
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,876
No. I'm sorry.

825
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:54,376
Excuse me.

826
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:07,709
Ok, you don't like me.

827
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:09,809
It's more like I don't want

828
00:37:09,817 --> 00:37:10,712
you to kiss me.

829
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:12,812
Why not?

830
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:14,816
I don't know.
Because.

831
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:16,943
I don't know.
We were having

832
00:37:17,043 --> 00:37:17,218
some fun,

833
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:19,003
and you are so beautiful.

834
00:37:19,103 --> 00:37:20,004
I just wanted to kiss you.

835
00:37:20,104 --> 00:37:22,104
Well...

836
00:37:23,608 --> 00:37:24,418
listen, I had a great night

837
00:37:24,518 --> 00:37:25,009
with you tonight,

838
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:26,444
but I just want to go home.

839
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:27,261
Oh, no.
Come on, Nora.

840
00:37:27,361 --> 00:37:29,814
I'm excited to be with you.

841
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,683
It's late.

842
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:34,819
There's nothing to do.

843
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:35,720
I wouldn't know what to do.

844
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,605
But we'll find something.

845
00:37:37,705 --> 00:37:40,208
Come on.
It's a beautiful night.

846
00:37:41,209 --> 00:37:43,209
I promise.

847
00:37:48,716 --> 00:37:49,617
What do you want to do?

848
00:37:49,717 --> 00:37:51,717
Where do you want to go?

849
00:37:51,719 --> 00:37:52,620
We'll go in here.

850
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,720
Here?

851
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:58,676
Nora, dance with me.

852
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:02,280
Oh, no, no.
Break. Break.

853
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,782
Uh, two shots of tequila.

854
00:38:04,817 --> 00:38:05,683
Is that ok with you?

855
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:06,684
Yeah.

856
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:08,784
Ok.

857
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:44,322
All I need is something to drink.

858
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:52,230
Bobby.

859
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,731
Nora.
Hey, baby.

860
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,233
What are you doing here?

861
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,320
I was on tour in Philly.

862
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,235
I had the night off.

863
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,737
I came back.
I had to do a few things.

864
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:01,239
What are you doing?

865
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,369
Actually, I have him with me.

866
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,810
Very nice.

867
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:10,313
So you want to be alone, no?

868
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,728
No. You know what?
This is perfect.

869
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:25,479
Oh, my god.
It's so crazy.

870
00:39:25,514 --> 00:39:26,380
Ay, ay, ay.

871
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,882
And you, Julian.
What are you doing here?

872
00:39:27,982 --> 00:39:29,800
Are you on vacation?

873
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,435
He's working on a movie.

874
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:33,037
He's not an actor, though.

875
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:35,705
Bobby: No?

876
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,740
I came here for a woman.

877
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:40,711
Ay, dios mio.
No, please. Ok.

878
00:39:40,746 --> 00:39:43,095
Tell me. Let's go.

879
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:47,001
She was my girlfriend,
she's an actress,

880
00:39:47,401 --> 00:39:50,805
and she came here to do a movie,

881
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:54,295
so I take a job on the movie so I can

882
00:39:54,395 --> 00:39:55,560
be close to her.

883
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:58,846
But then she leaves me for the actor

884
00:39:58,946 --> 00:40:00,464
in the movie.

885
00:40:04,852 --> 00:40:06,721
That's terrible.

886
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:09,140
So you're no good at love, too, huh?

887
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,143
No. Très mauvais.

888
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:23,287
Ok. Kiddies,
I got to go.

889
00:40:23,322 --> 00:40:24,488
It's getting late.

890
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:25,907
It's so late,
it's almost early.

891
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:26,724
It was a pleasure meeting you.

892
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:28,025
I hope to see you around more.

893
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:30,027
Ok, and thank you for the smoke.

894
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:31,028
Ah.

895
00:40:31,128 --> 00:40:33,128
Ciao.

896
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:37,034
Bobby: Oh.

897
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:39,518
She's a very good girl, ok?

898
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:41,038
Yes. I know.

899
00:40:41,138 --> 00:40:43,174
Ok. Ciao bello.

900
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:17,184
Hi.

901
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:19,628
What are you doing here?

902
00:42:20,237 --> 00:42:21,972
I'm making you coffee?

903
00:42:22,072 --> 00:42:23,708
I thought you left.

904
00:42:23,808 --> 00:42:25,943
No. I'm here.

905
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,547
You have plans for today?

906
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,554
Uh, no. No.
I guess not.

907
00:42:36,589 --> 00:42:38,554
It's ok, then?

908
00:42:40,524 --> 00:42:42,843
Yeah. Yeah.

909
00:42:50,668 --> 00:42:52,668
God.

910
00:42:52,803 --> 00:42:54,803
So, what do you want to do?

911
00:42:55,272 --> 00:42:57,272
I'm angry.

912
00:42:58,776 --> 00:43:00,177
Yeah? About what?

913
00:43:00,277 --> 00:43:02,780
I don't know.
Anything.

914
00:43:03,781 --> 00:43:05,781
What?

915
00:43:05,783 --> 00:43:07,783
I'm angry.

916
00:43:08,285 --> 00:43:10,753
Oh, you're hungry. Oh.

917
00:43:10,788 --> 00:43:12,189
I thought you said you were angry.

918
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:15,758
Oh, no. Never.
Never.

919
00:43:15,793 --> 00:43:17,795
So where do you want to eat?

920
00:43:20,798 --> 00:43:23,549
Food. Manja.

921
00:43:24,301 --> 00:43:26,301
Come on.

922
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:31,542
I had a nice time with you last night.

923
00:43:31,642 --> 00:43:32,510
Really?

924
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,610
Yeah, sure.

925
00:43:37,314 --> 00:43:39,700
Even though we didn't have sex?

926
00:43:39,735 --> 00:43:41,760
Of course.

927
00:43:41,795 --> 00:43:43,785
Why not?

928
00:43:45,823 --> 00:43:47,041
Do you think if you don't have

929
00:43:47,141 --> 00:43:47,725
sex with a man,

930
00:43:47,825 --> 00:43:49,460
he does not like you?

931
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,560
No.

932
00:43:56,217 --> 00:43:58,068
I don't know. Maybe.

933
00:43:58,168 --> 00:44:00,618
I think it just depends on the guy.

934
00:44:01,772 --> 00:44:04,675
You don't have any hang-ups, do you?

935
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:06,494
What is hang-ups?

936
00:44:06,594 --> 00:44:10,080
Problems, fears,
things that scare you.

937
00:44:10,115 --> 00:44:11,916
Like what things?

938
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:13,217
I don't know.

939
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:18,122
Uh, heart attacks,
terrorism,

940
00:44:18,157 --> 00:44:22,091
random acts of violence,

941
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:25,429
worrying about what other people think,

942
00:44:25,464 --> 00:44:27,097
not succeeding in life.

943
00:44:27,197 --> 00:44:30,284
Wow. That's a lot.

944
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:34,462
No. When I was 8 years old,

945
00:44:34,955 --> 00:44:36,955
my mother died,
and my father

946
00:44:37,047 --> 00:44:37,408
told me

947
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:39,875
that life was something short

948
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:42,479
and to always make some value in it.

949
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:46,170
When my father died,
I think I did the opposite.

950
00:44:48,218 --> 00:44:50,218
Is he still alive,
your dad?

951
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:53,641
Yes. He lives in the south of France.

952
00:44:53,676 --> 00:44:55,641
Marseilles.

953
00:44:56,827 --> 00:44:58,827
Marseilles?

954
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:03,000
Come on, Nora.

955
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,100
You've got to go somewhere.

956
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:08,770
I know. You're right.

957
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:17,865
We've been walking a lot.

958
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:18,866
Are you tired of walking?

959
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:19,867
No. It's perfect.

960
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:21,967
Yeah?

961
00:45:31,679 --> 00:45:33,679
I know what we can do.

962
00:45:38,369 --> 00:45:40,369
I love these penguins.

963
00:45:41,972 --> 00:45:43,073
Sometimes when I'm sad,
I come here

964
00:45:43,173 --> 00:45:45,326
and just watch them.

965
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,660
They make me feel better.

966
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:53,665
Come here.

967
00:45:56,887 --> 00:45:58,887
Come here.

968
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:07,179
I want to kiss you.

969
00:46:49,757 --> 00:46:50,658
La pirouette.

970
00:46:50,758 --> 00:46:51,659
La pirouette.

971
00:46:51,759 --> 00:46:52,660
Bien. Pirouette.

972
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:53,644
pwe wet.

973
00:46:53,744 --> 00:46:54,845
pwe wet?

974
00:47:01,218 --> 00:47:02,319
What would you say to a French girl

975
00:47:02,419 --> 00:47:04,355
if you were having sex with her?

976
00:47:04,455 --> 00:47:06,557
I would say, 'Oh! oh!

977
00:47:06,592 --> 00:47:09,002
C'est très bon!'

978
00:47:09,037 --> 00:47:11,412
Ah! Ha ha ha!

979
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:16,915
Are you starting to love me?

980
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:17,818
Ha ha! I'm not ready

981
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:20,858
to give out that information at this time.

982
00:47:22,423 --> 00:47:24,201
Nora, you are the exact

983
00:47:24,301 --> 00:47:26,301
girl that's on my mind.

984
00:47:28,212 --> 00:47:32,349
Shh. Shh. Shh.

985
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:57,939
What are you thinking?

986
00:48:00,277 --> 00:48:02,277
Hey.

987
00:48:04,615 --> 00:48:06,615
Nothing.

988
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:10,064
I was just thinking about how I was telling

989
00:48:10,164 --> 00:48:10,521
my friend Audrey

990
00:48:10,621 --> 00:48:13,123
that I wasn't gonna see anyone.

991
00:48:13,158 --> 00:48:15,891
and I changed your mind?

992
00:48:15,926 --> 00:48:17,828
Are you seeing anyone right now?

993
00:48:17,928 --> 00:48:21,448
No, not now.
Just you.

994
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:24,968
But you do see other women.

995
00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:27,771
If I meet someone I like, yes.

996
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:35,379
Why? What?

997
00:48:35,779 --> 00:48:37,281
Nothing.
Of course you do.

998
00:48:37,381 --> 00:48:39,381
But you don't?

999
00:48:42,986 --> 00:48:44,858
What is this?
What are we

1000
00:48:44,958 --> 00:48:46,090
doing here?

1001
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:47,758
We take a bath.

1002
00:48:47,858 --> 00:48:48,959
Why do you talk about love?

1003
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:49,760
When?

1004
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:53,061
Before.

1005
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:54,198
I'm just trying to figure out

1006
00:48:54,298 --> 00:48:55,799
if this is supposed to mean something.

1007
00:48:55,899 --> 00:48:57,468
I don't know, Nora.

1008
00:48:57,568 --> 00:48:59,336
We have no contract.

1009
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:02,139
We are just meeting each other.

1010
00:49:05,342 --> 00:49:07,071
You're right.
I'm sorry,

1011
00:49:07,171 --> 00:49:09,171
I'm sorry.

1012
00:49:14,234 --> 00:49:16,637
You still didn't tell me what you do.

1013
00:49:16,737 --> 00:49:19,117
I start to record sound on movies.

1014
00:49:19,239 --> 00:49:21,206
Ah. Mystery solved.

1015
00:49:21,241 --> 00:49:22,643
Do you like it?
Is it fun?

1016
00:49:22,743 --> 00:49:24,144
Yes, I like it.

1017
00:49:24,244 --> 00:49:26,430
I like to listen to people,

1018
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:29,833
to hear their voice,
how they feel,

1019
00:49:30,334 --> 00:49:32,334
and I get to travel.

1020
00:49:34,421 --> 00:49:35,322
But there's not only work.

1021
00:49:35,422 --> 00:49:37,040
I also play some music.

1022
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,170
Ugh. I'm so glad I don't have

1023
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:41,220
an acoustic guitar.

1024
00:49:51,104 --> 00:49:53,071
Nora?

1025
00:49:53,106 --> 00:49:54,808
Guy, hi.
How are you?

1026
00:49:54,843 --> 00:49:56,510
I'm great.
How are you?

1027
00:49:56,610 --> 00:49:57,511
Good. How are you?

1028
00:49:57,611 --> 00:49:59,012
I'm great.
I just got back

1029
00:49:59,112 --> 00:50:01,014
from a wedding in Rome last night.

1030
00:50:01,114 --> 00:50:02,516
You know Jim, right?
Yeah.

1031
00:50:02,616 --> 00:50:04,017
Yeah. It was his wedding.

1032
00:50:04,117 --> 00:50:05,018
It was totally insane.

1033
00:50:05,118 --> 00:50:06,320
That sounds great.

1034
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:10,424
Yeah. Hey.
Uh, I'm Guy.

1035
00:50:10,459 --> 00:50:11,825
Sorry.

1036
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:13,925
Hi. I'm Julian.

1037
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:16,330
You, uh, you around this summer?

1038
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:17,831
Yeah. Yeah.
I have no plans.

1039
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:19,333
I'm just working,
you know?

1040
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:21,650
Ok. Well, cool.

1041
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:22,920
Um, I'm here and at the beach,

1042
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:23,921
so I'll give you a call.

1043
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:25,164
Great.
Nice to meet you,

1044
00:50:25,264 --> 00:50:25,422
man.

1045
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:26,423
Nice to meet you.

1046
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:28,523
See you.
Bye.

1047
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:40,953
I'll have, um,
half a dozen

1048
00:50:40,988 --> 00:50:43,390
of the white cookies with the sprinkles

1049
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:45,800
and, um-they're famous for their

1050
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:46,393
cannolis.

1051
00:50:46,493 --> 00:50:48,278
I'll have a half a dozen of those

1052
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:49,196
and, um...

1053
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:02,759
I'm so sorry.
I was so rude.

1054
00:51:02,859 --> 00:51:04,861
I don't know what happened.

1055
00:51:07,297 --> 00:51:08,832
I'm just so stupid sometimes.

1056
00:51:08,932 --> 00:51:10,434
I just got caught off guard.

1057
00:51:10,534 --> 00:51:13,153
I'm just not used to being with someone.

1058
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:15,772
I mean, not that we're together or anything,

1059
00:51:15,872 --> 00:51:17,774
but I'm just not that experienced

1060
00:51:17,874 --> 00:51:21,143
in how to act with a guy.

1061
00:51:21,178 --> 00:51:22,429
It's just so weird you come into my life,

1062
00:51:22,529 --> 00:51:25,032
and-I don't know- you've...

1063
00:51:30,787 --> 00:51:32,817
I have to go to the bathroom.

1064
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:43,500
What are you doing here?

1065
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,600
I'm such a freak.

1066
00:51:48,305 --> 00:51:51,141
I've turned into such a bitch.

1067
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:09,526
Are you ok?

1068
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:11,795
Yeah.

1069
00:52:12,195 --> 00:52:13,297
I'm not mad at you.

1070
00:52:13,397 --> 00:52:16,199
Oh, good.
I'm relieved.

1071
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:19,368
Something wrong?

1072
00:52:19,403 --> 00:52:21,403
I just want to go home.

1073
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:26,843
Hey. I don't think you're ok.

1074
00:52:26,943 --> 00:52:30,180
I'm ok. I just want to go home.

1075
00:52:30,215 --> 00:52:32,180
Do you run from me?
No.

1076
00:52:32,182 --> 00:52:33,583
Do you feel sick?

1077
00:52:33,683 --> 00:52:35,085
Yes, I feel sick.

1078
00:52:35,185 --> 00:52:37,215
I feel like I'm going to die.

1079
00:52:45,128 --> 00:52:46,013
What are you doing?

1080
00:52:46,113 --> 00:52:47,014
Oh, come on, no.
What are you doing?

1081
00:52:47,114 --> 00:52:48,515
No, no!
Give it to me!

1082
00:52:48,615 --> 00:52:49,516
Give it to me!
I'm not gonna kill myself!

1083
00:52:49,616 --> 00:52:51,616
I'm just gonna take one!

1084
00:53:28,438 --> 00:53:30,438
Are you ok?

1085
00:53:32,909 --> 00:53:34,909
I will be.

1086
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:39,850
Is there something wrong with you?

1087
00:53:39,885 --> 00:53:41,850
Yeah. I'm a freak.

1088
00:53:44,654 --> 00:53:46,656
I had an anxiety attack.

1089
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:51,862
Do you want me to stay with you,

1090
00:53:51,962 --> 00:53:55,165
or do you want to be alone?

1091
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,165
You can stay.

1092
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:04,495
I'm not good for a NY action, though.

1093
00:54:17,204 --> 00:54:19,779
That hasn't happened in a really

1094
00:54:19,879 --> 00:54:20,924
long time.

1095
00:54:21,024 --> 00:54:23,024
It's really scary.

1096
00:54:44,648 --> 00:54:46,648
Julian?

1097
00:54:52,722 --> 00:54:54,722
Julian?

1098
00:55:59,973 --> 00:56:00,874
Hi.

1099
00:56:00,974 --> 00:56:04,978
Hey. You came back.

1100
00:56:05,478 --> 00:56:06,880
I'm-I'm very sorry for what I did.

1101
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:09,482
No. I'm sorry.
I'm just an idiot.

1102
00:56:09,517 --> 00:56:10,884
You didn't do anything.

1103
00:56:10,984 --> 00:56:13,603
I just blew things out of proportion.

1104
00:56:13,638 --> 00:56:14,888
We were having so much fun.

1105
00:56:14,988 --> 00:56:16,988
I'm fine now.

1106
00:56:19,993 --> 00:56:22,345
You know, Nora,
I'm leaving tomorrow,

1107
00:56:22,445 --> 00:56:24,511
and I thought maybe we could spend this night

1108
00:56:24,611 --> 00:56:25,549
together if you want.

1109
00:56:25,649 --> 00:56:27,033
Tomorrow?

1110
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:29,133
Yes. Very early.

1111
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:39,112
I had the best time with you, Nora.

1112
00:56:39,529 --> 00:56:42,163
Me, too.

1113
00:56:42,198 --> 00:56:44,084
Come with me.
Come to see paris.

1114
00:56:44,184 --> 00:56:45,585
Come on the plane tomorrow

1115
00:56:45,685 --> 00:56:47,087
and run away with me.

1116
00:56:47,187 --> 00:56:48,088
No. I can't.

1117
00:56:48,188 --> 00:56:49,589
I can't.
Why not?

1118
00:56:49,689 --> 00:56:51,091
A million reasons.

1119
00:56:51,191 --> 00:56:52,040
Like, I couldn't possibly be ready

1120
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:52,592
to do that in time.

1121
00:56:52,692 --> 00:56:55,095
I- I have to work.
I have obligations.

1122
00:56:55,195 --> 00:56:57,597
Those are only some excuses, all right?

1123
00:56:57,697 --> 00:56:58,598
I want you to come.

1124
00:56:58,698 --> 00:56:59,599
What are you gonna do?

1125
00:56:59,699 --> 00:57:01,601
Stay all your life,
do the same thing?

1126
00:57:01,701 --> 00:57:05,705
No. I'm-I'm just being realistic.

1127
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:07,007
We've only known each other

1128
00:57:07,107 --> 00:57:08,108
for a couple of days.

1129
00:57:08,208 --> 00:57:09,609
I can't just pretend that everything

1130
00:57:09,709 --> 00:57:11,111
would just magically work itself out.

1131
00:57:11,211 --> 00:57:13,211
I know better.

1132
00:57:16,216 --> 00:57:17,623
You shouldn't make promises that you

1133
00:57:17,723 --> 00:57:18,118
can't keep.

1134
00:57:18,218 --> 00:57:20,502
Why not?

1135
00:57:20,537 --> 00:57:23,305
I don't know.
Uh...

1136
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:25,091
It's just not what I imagined for myself.

1137
00:57:25,191 --> 00:57:26,876
I'm not like that.

1138
00:57:26,976 --> 00:57:28,812
Why? Because I'm French,

1139
00:57:28,912 --> 00:57:30,180
because I'm younger than you?

1140
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,749
What is it?

1141
00:57:33,149 --> 00:57:35,529
Yeah. You live in another country.

1142
00:57:41,157 --> 00:57:43,397
we've had a really nice weekend.

1143
00:57:46,029 --> 00:57:49,230
You shouldn't feel bad about it.

1144
00:57:49,265 --> 00:57:51,855
I don't want to fight about this now.

1145
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:54,821
I'll come to Paris with you

1146
00:57:54,921 --> 00:57:58,186
and we'll just see how it goes sometime

1147
00:57:58,286 --> 00:57:59,326
in the future.

1148
00:57:59,426 --> 00:58:01,426
You promise?

1149
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:05,563
Yeah.

1150
00:59:00,136 --> 00:59:02,136
Ok, Nora.
I have to go.

1151
00:59:06,192 --> 00:59:08,192
I had a great time with you.

1152
00:59:11,848 --> 00:59:13,848
Don't cry.

1153
00:59:17,287 --> 00:59:19,202
I left my cell phone number next

1154
00:59:19,302 --> 00:59:19,989
to your bed.

1155
00:59:21,691 --> 00:59:24,084
Come here.

1156
00:59:24,477 --> 00:59:26,477
Kiss me.

1157
01:00:17,647 --> 01:00:19,614
What?

1158
01:00:19,649 --> 01:00:21,050
You need to go on a date.

1159
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:23,152
Ugh. No.
Mm-hmm.

1160
01:00:23,653 --> 01:00:25,054
Duty dating.

1161
01:00:25,154 --> 01:00:26,055
What's that?

1162
01:00:26,155 --> 01:00:27,286
There's a theory that you should

1163
01:00:27,386 --> 01:00:27,557
go out

1164
01:00:27,657 --> 01:00:29,058
with guys who ask you out,

1165
01:00:29,158 --> 01:00:30,824
even if you know you don't like

1166
01:00:30,924 --> 01:00:31,561
them in that way.

1167
01:00:31,661 --> 01:00:33,062
For practice.

1168
01:00:33,162 --> 01:00:35,363
That is the saddest thing I think I've

1169
01:00:35,463 --> 01:00:36,065
ever heard.

1170
01:00:36,165 --> 01:00:38,132
No, it's not.

1171
01:00:38,167 --> 01:00:39,869
You need to get out there again.

1172
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:41,371
Otherwise, you're just gonna retreat.

1173
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:43,139
I know you, Nora.

1174
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:45,241
Nobody's asking me out.

1175
01:00:45,276 --> 01:00:46,876
Uh-uh

1176
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:50,847
Steve, you tell Nora you were an architect?

1177
01:00:50,882 --> 01:00:53,017
Yeah. I was doing private homes

1178
01:00:53,067 --> 01:00:54,684
and office buildings.

1179
01:00:54,784 --> 01:00:57,604
I mostly build boutique hotels now.

1180
01:00:57,639 --> 01:00:59,604
I have to say,
it's really

1181
01:00:59,637 --> 01:01:01,391
challenging, you know...

1182
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:03,643
Mm-hmm.
Making each one

1183
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:04,594
different.

1184
01:01:04,694 --> 01:01:06,694
Mm.

1185
01:01:08,298 --> 01:01:09,617
Nora works in a hotel,

1186
01:01:09,717 --> 01:01:10,600
Sullivan House.

1187
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:13,202
Is that right?

1188
01:01:13,237 --> 01:01:14,838
Yeah.

1189
01:01:14,938 --> 01:01:16,938
Do you like it?

1190
01:01:19,742 --> 01:01:21,742
No.

1191
01:01:22,545 --> 01:01:24,545
Not really.

1192
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:37,143
Hi, Nora.

1193
01:01:37,243 --> 01:01:38,428
You got a minute?

1194
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:39,762
Yeah.

1195
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:42,265
I just wanted to talk to you seriously

1196
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:43,967
just for a bit.

1197
01:01:44,067 --> 01:01:46,951
Ok.

1198
01:01:46,986 --> 01:01:49,705
I was wondering, um,
how it's going,

1199
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:52,425
how you're doing with the planning

1200
01:01:52,525 --> 01:01:54,210
of the company picnic.

1201
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:55,845
Oh. That.

1202
01:01:55,945 --> 01:01:59,207
Um, I, uh, haven't really gotten

1203
01:01:59,307 --> 01:02:00,917
around to it yet.

1204
01:02:01,017 --> 01:02:04,086
We've been kind of swamped.

1205
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:07,121
Haven't got around to it yet?

1206
01:02:07,156 --> 01:02:09,433
Uh, Nora, there's only 5 weeks left.

1207
01:02:09,468 --> 01:02:11,711
I mean, there's a lot more to it

1208
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:14,562
than-than just locations alone.

1209
01:02:14,597 --> 01:02:16,583
I mean, you've got food and invites, buses,

1210
01:02:16,683 --> 01:02:18,585
games, employee of the month.

1211
01:02:18,685 --> 01:02:20,618
Have you even voted for the employee

1212
01:02:20,718 --> 01:02:21,604
of the month yet?

1213
01:02:21,704 --> 01:02:23,704
Not yet.

1214
01:02:23,706 --> 01:02:25,622
Well, when were you planning on doing

1215
01:02:25,722 --> 01:02:26,309
all of this?

1216
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:27,997
I don't know.

1217
01:02:28,097 --> 01:02:29,913
I'm sorry. I forgot.

1218
01:02:30,013 --> 01:02:30,889
Look. You know what?
I don't understand

1219
01:02:30,989 --> 01:02:31,231
what's wrong

1220
01:02:31,331 --> 01:02:32,732
with you lately, Nora.

1221
01:02:32,832 --> 01:02:34,799
You were always so reliable,

1222
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:35,985
and now you don't even come around anymore.

1223
01:02:36,085 --> 01:02:38,955
Nobody's seen you.
What's wrong with you?

1224
01:02:38,990 --> 01:02:41,040
Is everything ok?

1225
01:02:41,524 --> 01:02:44,360
Because you cannot go on like this.

1226
01:02:44,395 --> 01:02:45,238
You know what, Perry?

1227
01:02:45,338 --> 01:02:45,862
You're right.

1228
01:02:45,962 --> 01:02:47,530
I can't go on like this.

1229
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:49,332
I've been awful.

1230
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:51,701
I can't do this anymore.

1231
01:02:51,736 --> 01:02:53,202
Do what?

1232
01:02:53,302 --> 01:02:57,056
This! I can't do this anymore!

1233
01:03:45,688 --> 01:03:48,191
I see something in you.

1234
01:03:48,226 --> 01:03:50,158
Huh?

1235
01:03:50,193 --> 01:03:52,853
I can tell you things about your life.

1236
01:03:56,833 --> 01:04:01,120
Your father misses you.

1237
01:04:01,621 --> 01:04:04,324
You were his favorite person in the world.

1238
01:04:08,428 --> 01:04:11,114
He knows how lonely you are,

1239
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:15,518
and he wants me to help you.

1240
01:04:15,553 --> 01:04:17,518
Come inside.

1241
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:25,993
So wait a minute.

1242
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:27,930
You went to a psychic to have

1243
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:29,432
a curse put on you.

1244
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:32,401
Please. I'm humiliated enough as it is.

1245
01:04:32,802 --> 01:04:33,503
She didn't put a curse on me.

1246
01:04:33,603 --> 01:04:35,603
She removed a curse.

1247
01:04:35,621 --> 01:04:36,873
Did you pay her?

1248
01:04:36,973 --> 01:04:38,191
I don't want to talk about it.

1249
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:40,291
No. Please.
I have to know

1250
01:04:40,443 --> 01:04:42,445
so I can understand your insanity.

1251
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:44,547
I don't know.

1252
01:04:44,947 --> 01:04:46,582
I'm going totally crazy.

1253
01:04:46,682 --> 01:04:48,716
You'll be fine.

1254
01:04:48,751 --> 01:04:50,820
No, I won't.
I quit my job,

1255
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:53,988
and I went to a witchdoctor.

1256
01:04:54,023 --> 01:04:56,025
I can't believe you quit your job.

1257
01:04:56,125 --> 01:04:58,109
I know.

1258
01:04:58,144 --> 01:05:00,734
Do you think that was the right thing

1259
01:05:00,784 --> 01:05:02,784
to do?

1260
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,900
Maybe it was.

1261
01:05:08,304 --> 01:05:11,908
Maybe I should have gone with Julian.

1262
01:05:11,943 --> 01:05:14,527
Why didn't you?

1263
01:05:14,562 --> 01:05:17,111
I'm a coward.

1264
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:22,385
So... what are you gonna do about it?

1265
01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:29,508
Is this safe?

1266
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:31,726
It's fine. relax.

1267
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:33,162
we don't even know what's in here.

1268
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:34,163
What if it's drugs?

1269
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:36,165
It is not drugs.
My parents know the guy.

1270
01:05:36,265 --> 01:05:38,134
I can't believe we're doing this.

1271
01:05:38,234 --> 01:05:40,670
Listen. It was the only cheap ticket. I swear.

1272
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:42,455
Oh! I hate Mark.

1273
01:05:42,555 --> 01:05:45,875
He's mad that we're doing this courier shit,

1274
01:05:45,910 --> 01:05:48,277
riding coach. Oy.

1275
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:04,866
Uh, hi.
We're not sure

1276
01:06:04,966 --> 01:06:05,695
where to go.

1277
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:08,035
Um, we need a small,
little hotel

1278
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:11,655
in the middle of town that's not

1279
01:06:11,755 --> 01:06:13,202
very expensive.

1280
01:06:13,302 --> 01:06:15,204
I don't think he understands you.

1281
01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:16,706
Oh, no.
I think he does.

1282
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:18,708
They just pretend not to understand.

1283
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:19,709
Watch this.

1284
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:21,811
Excusez-moi.
Vous comprendre?

1285
01:06:21,846 --> 01:06:25,314
Oui, oui.
I understand.

1286
01:06:25,349 --> 01:06:27,314
Hmm?

1287
01:06:48,454 --> 01:06:50,454
Merci beaucoup.

1288
01:06:51,958 --> 01:06:53,958
Thank you very much.

1289
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:56,963
I hope you find happiness.

1290
01:06:56,998 --> 01:06:58,364
A penis?

1291
01:06:58,464 --> 01:07:00,464
Yes.

1292
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:15,981
Oh...

1293
01:07:15,982 --> 01:07:17,982
Skanky.

1294
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:26,707
Well, at least it has a bathroom.

1295
01:07:26,742 --> 01:07:29,145
This really sucks.
I'm sorry, Audrey.

1296
01:07:29,245 --> 01:07:30,646
Don't be ridiculous.
We're in Paris.

1297
01:07:30,746 --> 01:07:32,148
We're gonna find Julian.

1298
01:07:32,248 --> 01:07:34,150
Let's deliver these packages first,

1299
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:35,651
get it out of the way.

1300
01:07:35,751 --> 01:07:37,153
We're so crazy for doing this.

1301
01:07:37,253 --> 01:07:37,819
I know.

1302
01:07:37,919 --> 01:07:39,155
It's totally crazy.

1303
01:07:39,255 --> 01:07:41,443
You know, we could probably get a map

1304
01:07:41,543 --> 01:07:42,158
downstairs.

1305
01:07:42,258 --> 01:07:44,076
Oh, you're so on it.

1306
01:07:44,176 --> 01:07:45,077
Well, it's probably just easier for me

1307
01:07:45,177 --> 01:07:47,129
to be objective right now.

1308
01:07:47,179 --> 01:07:49,081
When should we meet back here?

1309
01:07:49,181 --> 01:07:49,941
I don't know.
Like an hour,

1310
01:07:50,041 --> 01:07:50,583
an hour and a half?

1311
01:07:50,683 --> 01:07:52,234
But if we get held up,

1312
01:07:52,334 --> 01:07:53,085
let's just call the hotel

1313
01:07:53,185 --> 01:07:55,152
and touch base, ok?
Ok.

1314
01:07:55,187 --> 01:07:57,549
Ok. Now which way is the Seine?

1315
01:07:57,584 --> 01:07:59,911
Because I am going the opposite

1316
01:08:00,011 --> 01:08:02,011
direction.

1317
01:08:09,201 --> 01:08:11,168
Excusez-moi.
Oui?

1318
01:08:11,203 --> 01:08:13,105
Do you speak English?
A little.

1319
01:08:13,205 --> 01:08:14,607
Could you tell me where the Hotel Meurice is?

1320
01:08:14,707 --> 01:08:16,108
Uh, it's just over there.

1321
01:08:16,208 --> 01:08:18,208
Ok. Great.

1322
01:09:03,072 --> 01:09:05,072
Madame Grenelle?

1323
01:09:13,416 --> 01:09:15,416
Madame Grenelle?

1324
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:19,872
Qui est lá?

1325
01:09:19,905 --> 01:09:21,989
Uh, I'm sorry.

1326
01:09:22,024 --> 01:09:24,393
Je ne parlez français.

1327
01:09:24,428 --> 01:09:26,727
Do you speak English?

1328
01:09:26,762 --> 01:09:28,264
Of course I speak English.

1329
01:09:28,364 --> 01:09:31,132
What do you want?

1330
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:33,469
My name is Nora.
I have a package for you.

1331
01:09:33,569 --> 01:09:35,071
The door was open.

1332
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:37,173
Well, bring it to me.

1333
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:45,709
I hope I'm not bothering you.

1334
01:09:47,416 --> 01:09:50,219
It's been a long time.

1335
01:09:50,254 --> 01:09:51,320
Excuse me?

1336
01:09:58,027 --> 01:09:59,428
Mr. Larson?

1337
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:01,530
Hi. I'm Audrey.

1338
01:10:01,565 --> 01:10:03,530
Come in.

1339
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:11,538
Please sit down.

1340
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:20,047
Thank you very much.

1341
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:29,558
I wouldn't entrust this to the regular mail.

1342
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:33,733
But I have to say I didn't imagine

1343
01:10:33,833 --> 01:10:34,964
someone like you

1344
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:37,064
delivering it to me.

1345
01:10:46,876 --> 01:10:49,678
Are you surprised?

1346
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:52,079
Yes.

1347
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:58,003
Are you hungry?

1348
01:11:02,057 --> 01:11:07,730
Um, actually,
yeah, I am.

1349
01:11:07,765 --> 01:11:09,730
Let's go.

1350
01:11:22,778 --> 01:11:26,782
You turned out very pretty.

1351
01:11:26,817 --> 01:11:28,782
Thank you.

1352
01:11:30,736 --> 01:11:35,241
You know, your mother never let me see you much.

1353
01:11:35,276 --> 01:11:38,327
I think she was ashamed of me,

1354
01:11:38,362 --> 01:11:40,327
and she moved to America.

1355
01:11:40,329 --> 01:11:45,134
She was always taking these wild chances,

1356
01:11:45,169 --> 01:11:48,938
and your father was quite handsome.

1357
01:11:52,007 --> 01:11:54,007
Where do you live?

1358
01:11:54,009 --> 01:11:55,411
New York City.

1359
01:11:55,511 --> 01:11:56,912
Are you married?

1360
01:11:57,012 --> 01:11:58,347
No.

1361
01:11:58,447 --> 01:12:00,432
But you want to be.

1362
01:12:00,849 --> 01:12:02,418
Yeah. I guess so.

1363
01:12:02,518 --> 01:12:04,952
Why?

1364
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:06,155
I don't know.

1365
01:12:06,255 --> 01:12:08,222
I, um...

1366
01:12:08,257 --> 01:12:11,727
I guess then I would really know that

1367
01:12:11,827 --> 01:12:13,295
someone loved me.

1368
01:12:13,395 --> 01:12:16,330
Marriage is a contract,

1369
01:12:16,365 --> 01:12:20,536
but to feel love is something else entirely.

1370
01:12:22,938 --> 01:12:25,458
I don't think I've ever really been

1371
01:12:25,527 --> 01:12:25,941
in love.

1372
01:12:26,041 --> 01:12:28,994
You have probably been in love

1373
01:12:29,094 --> 01:12:30,346
lots of times.

1374
01:12:30,446 --> 01:12:35,784
Besides, you are young.
You have time.

1375
01:12:35,819 --> 01:12:38,619
But I'm getting older.

1376
01:12:38,654 --> 01:12:41,357
You will be fine.
You are from good stock.

1377
01:12:41,457 --> 01:12:44,660
Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

1378
01:12:45,060 --> 01:12:47,213
You will get nowhere in this world

1379
01:12:47,313 --> 01:12:49,748
by feeling sorry for yourself.

1380
01:12:53,802 --> 01:12:57,142
So what will happen to you when your friend

1381
01:12:57,242 --> 01:12:58,274
finds this man?

1382
01:12:58,374 --> 01:13:00,374
Depending on how happy he is

1383
01:13:00,424 --> 01:13:01,060
to see her,

1384
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:03,161
either I'll leave on my own,

1385
01:13:03,162 --> 01:13:05,162
or I'll take Nora with me.

1386
01:13:07,082 --> 01:13:09,118
I love being in Paris.

1387
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:12,853
My wife loves it here.

1388
01:13:12,888 --> 01:13:16,056
Sometimes comes with our children.

1389
01:13:16,091 --> 01:13:18,346
and she doesn't mind you taking another

1390
01:13:18,446 --> 01:13:19,261
woman to lunch?

1391
01:13:19,361 --> 01:13:21,013
Not at all.

1392
01:13:21,113 --> 01:13:24,693
Does your fiancé mind you going to lunch

1393
01:13:24,793 --> 01:13:25,334
with me?

1394
01:13:25,434 --> 01:13:27,403
Yeah. I don't think he'd be too crazy

1395
01:13:27,503 --> 01:13:28,888
about me having lunch

1396
01:13:28,988 --> 01:13:32,408
with a handsome stranger in Paris.

1397
01:13:32,443 --> 01:13:33,726
No.

1398
01:13:33,826 --> 01:13:36,076
And he's my husband.

1399
01:13:36,111 --> 01:13:38,747
I just forgot to wear my ring.

1400
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:44,051
Is that terrible?

1401
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:47,689
You know, I think in relationships

1402
01:13:47,724 --> 01:13:51,258
there are things you are honest about

1403
01:13:51,293 --> 01:13:55,097
and things you choose to keep to yourself.

1404
01:13:55,132 --> 01:13:58,901
Are you good at keeping secrets, Audrey?

1405
01:14:03,806 --> 01:14:05,207
I have to call my friend.

1406
01:14:05,307 --> 01:14:08,043
Can I borrow your cell phone, please?

1407
01:14:29,798 --> 01:14:31,798
Sorry I'm late.

1408
01:14:37,589 --> 01:14:40,092
What's going on here?

1409
01:14:40,127 --> 01:14:42,376
What happened?

1410
01:14:42,411 --> 01:14:43,912
Nora, what happened?

1411
01:14:44,012 --> 01:14:46,182
Did we get robbed or something?

1412
01:14:48,417 --> 01:14:50,417
I lost the piece of paper

1413
01:14:50,419 --> 01:14:54,022
with Julian's number on it.

1414
01:14:54,057 --> 01:14:54,723
What?

1415
01:14:54,823 --> 01:14:57,025
I looked everywhere.

1416
01:14:57,060 --> 01:14:59,228
Look at this place.

1417
01:14:59,263 --> 01:15:00,980
It's gone.

1418
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:03,582
Ok. We'll find it.

1419
01:15:04,083 --> 01:15:04,984
You don't understand.

1420
01:15:05,084 --> 01:15:09,136
I looked everywhere 20 times.

1421
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:12,374
Well, I'll look again with fresh eyes, ok?

1422
01:15:12,409 --> 01:15:14,118
What about the phone book

1423
01:15:14,218 --> 01:15:15,144
or information?

1424
01:15:17,246 --> 01:15:20,013
His last name is Durand.

1425
01:15:20,048 --> 01:15:22,851
It's like the Smith of France.

1426
01:15:23,252 --> 01:15:25,224
Then I talked to the concierge

1427
01:15:25,324 --> 01:15:26,555
for, like, an hour.

1428
01:15:26,655 --> 01:15:30,726
I've tried everything.

1429
01:15:31,126 --> 01:15:35,130
I even called Glen.
He wasn't there.

1430
01:15:37,132 --> 01:15:39,132
Are you ok?

1431
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:47,042
Well, I want to feel that way, too.

1432
01:15:47,077 --> 01:15:49,042
All right.

1433
01:15:51,163 --> 01:15:53,630
This.

1434
01:15:53,665 --> 01:15:55,067
I'm gonna go take a shower.

1435
01:15:55,167 --> 01:15:56,485
I'll be back.

1436
01:15:56,585 --> 01:15:58,585
Ok.

1437
01:16:49,671 --> 01:16:53,675
I'm sorry about today.

1438
01:16:53,710 --> 01:16:56,443
You called.

1439
01:16:56,478 --> 01:16:58,478
Tomorrow will be fun.

1440
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:03,285
Thanks for coming with me.

1441
01:17:05,687 --> 01:17:07,889
I love you, Nora.

1442
01:17:08,090 --> 01:17:10,092
I love you, too.

1443
01:17:12,895 --> 01:17:14,895
Good night.

1444
01:17:28,911 --> 01:17:31,179
Good morning.

1445
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:34,616
Whoa. You're pretty chipper today.

1446
01:17:34,651 --> 01:17:37,419
Yeah. This is ridiculous.

1447
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:39,122
I came here to surprise some guy

1448
01:17:39,222 --> 01:17:39,721
I hardly know

1449
01:17:39,821 --> 01:17:42,224
that I can't find,
but so what?

1450
01:17:42,259 --> 01:17:43,325
We're in Paris.

1451
01:17:43,425 --> 01:17:45,327
Yeah. We've always wanted to do this.

1452
01:17:45,427 --> 01:17:47,794
Yeah. So let's just enjoy it.

1453
01:17:47,829 --> 01:17:49,731
It's time I got my sense of humor back.

1454
01:17:49,831 --> 01:17:51,798
Good for you.

1455
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:52,935
I think we should still look around town

1456
01:17:53,035 --> 01:17:54,136
for your mystery man.

1457
01:17:54,236 --> 01:17:55,737
You never know.
We may run into him.

1458
01:17:55,837 --> 01:17:56,810
Yeah. What do I have to lose

1459
01:17:56,910 --> 01:17:57,372
at this point?

1460
01:17:57,472 --> 01:17:58,640
Nothing.

1461
01:17:58,740 --> 01:18:01,143
Plus we can go shopping.

1462
01:18:01,178 --> 01:18:02,244
Right.

1463
01:18:05,547 --> 01:18:08,350
Ohh.
I can't believe

1464
01:18:08,385 --> 01:18:11,118
it's raining in Paris.

1465
01:18:11,153 --> 01:18:13,291
I can't believe I thought I'd find

1466
01:18:13,391 --> 01:18:14,756
Julian in these places

1467
01:18:14,856 --> 01:18:17,359
unless he's into women's clothes.

1468
01:18:20,362 --> 01:18:23,865
Do you want to get a tea or something?

1469
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:25,832
A tea?

1470
01:18:25,867 --> 01:18:26,768
That's funny.

1471
01:18:26,868 --> 01:18:27,769
Ha ha ha!

1472
01:18:27,869 --> 01:18:31,790
Thank you.
Merci.

1473
01:18:32,190 --> 01:18:34,710
Did you see what was in the package?

1474
01:18:36,244 --> 01:18:38,714
Just some business papers.

1475
01:18:38,749 --> 01:18:39,414
What about you?

1476
01:18:39,514 --> 01:18:42,117
No. Nothing too exciting.

1477
01:18:42,317 --> 01:18:44,720
The old lady was really cool.

1478
01:18:47,522 --> 01:18:49,825
She thought I was her granddaughter.

1479
01:18:49,925 --> 01:18:53,128
God. That kind of thing
only happens to you, Nora.

1480
01:18:53,228 --> 01:18:55,429
Ha ha!

1481
01:18:55,631 --> 01:18:57,631
Ahh.

1482
01:18:57,649 --> 01:18:59,649
Mark called this morning.

1483
01:19:01,169 --> 01:19:02,838
He said he missed me.

1484
01:19:02,938 --> 01:19:05,199
Wanted to know if I wanted to work

1485
01:19:05,299 --> 01:19:06,608
on our relationship.

1486
01:19:06,708 --> 01:19:09,511
Do you?

1487
01:19:09,911 --> 01:19:11,912
I suppose.

1488
01:19:11,947 --> 01:19:13,060
I mean, I guess I just shouldn't throw

1489
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:13,599
my marriage away

1490
01:19:13,699 --> 01:19:15,967
without trying.

1491
01:19:16,385 --> 01:19:18,785
I mean, I do really love him.

1492
01:19:18,820 --> 01:19:19,955
Maybe I just shouldn't be so critical

1493
01:19:20,055 --> 01:19:21,156
just because things aren't
in the greatest place,

1494
01:19:21,256 --> 01:19:24,024
you know?

1495
01:19:24,059 --> 01:19:26,089
I think that's great, Audrey.

1496
01:19:36,722 --> 01:19:38,724
Ok.

1497
01:19:40,726 --> 01:19:42,726
Let's do it.

1498
01:19:45,981 --> 01:19:47,998
Audrey...

1499
01:19:48,033 --> 01:19:49,418
I know I'm crazy,

1500
01:19:49,518 --> 01:19:52,320
but I think I'm gonna stay.

1501
01:19:54,573 --> 01:19:56,068
Nora, I am your friend,

1502
01:19:56,168 --> 01:19:57,125
and I love you,

1503
01:19:57,225 --> 01:19:59,535
but this just isn't working out.

1504
01:20:01,663 --> 01:20:05,167
You got to give this up.

1505
01:20:05,202 --> 01:20:07,036
I can't.

1506
01:20:07,071 --> 01:20:08,870
You go.

1507
01:20:08,970 --> 01:20:10,872
I know Mark is waiting for you.

1508
01:20:10,972 --> 01:20:11,967
Nora, you have no sense

1509
01:20:12,067 --> 01:20:12,608
of direction,

1510
01:20:12,708 --> 01:20:14,943
and you are way too shy.

1511
01:20:15,343 --> 01:20:16,445
Do you want me to stay with you?

1512
01:20:16,545 --> 01:20:18,213
Because I will.

1513
01:20:18,313 --> 01:20:22,282
No. I have to do this for myself.

1514
01:20:22,317 --> 01:20:24,219
I have to stop relying on other people

1515
01:20:24,319 --> 01:20:26,319
to make decisions for me.

1516
01:20:28,106 --> 01:20:29,508
You're gonna come home, aren't you?

1517
01:20:29,608 --> 01:20:32,369
Yeah. I have no job and no money.

1518
01:20:32,611 --> 01:20:35,131
I have to come back to reality soon.

1519
01:20:36,114 --> 01:20:37,899
What are you gonna do?

1520
01:20:37,999 --> 01:20:39,999
I don't know.

1521
01:20:40,252 --> 01:20:43,255
Something I feel like doing, I guess.

1522
01:20:43,290 --> 01:20:46,758
Well, I'm really proud of you.

1523
01:20:50,262 --> 01:20:51,163
I got to go.

1524
01:20:51,263 --> 01:20:53,263
I know.

1525
01:20:54,766 --> 01:20:56,766
Ok.

1526
01:21:00,689 --> 01:21:02,924
I'll call you.

1527
01:21:03,325 --> 01:21:05,325
You weirdo.

1528
01:22:53,802 --> 01:22:55,203
I don't speak French.

1529
01:22:55,303 --> 01:22:57,492
Ah. I said,
'it makes me

1530
01:22:57,592 --> 01:22:58,707
want to cry. '

1531
01:22:58,807 --> 01:23:00,807
You are American?

1532
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:04,813
What are you doing in Paris?

1533
01:23:05,313 --> 01:23:06,715
Just looking.
Just looking?

1534
01:23:06,815 --> 01:23:09,317
You like art.

1535
01:23:12,270 --> 01:23:14,272
Ah. I go with my friends.

1536
01:23:14,773 --> 01:23:15,674
We go have a coffee.

1537
01:23:15,774 --> 01:23:17,175
You want to come with us?

1538
01:23:17,275 --> 01:23:18,677
No, thank you.

1539
01:23:18,777 --> 01:23:19,678
Ok. Well, if you change your mind,

1540
01:23:19,778 --> 01:23:22,180
we'll be just across the street, ok?

1541
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:23,017
Ok.

1542
01:23:23,117 --> 01:23:25,117
I'll see you there.

1543
01:23:44,436 --> 01:23:47,439
Ah, si, si.
Eh, come, come.

1544
01:23:52,227 --> 01:23:53,545
Hi.
Hi.

1545
01:23:53,645 --> 01:23:55,046
Sit down,
sit down.

1546
01:23:55,146 --> 01:23:56,548
What's your name?

1547
01:23:56,648 --> 01:23:57,549
Nora.
Nora, hi.

1548
01:23:57,649 --> 01:23:59,050
I'm Guillaume.
- Guillaume.

1549
01:23:59,150 --> 01:24:00,552
This is Sébastien.

1550
01:24:00,652 --> 01:24:01,553
Nice to meet you.

1551
01:24:01,653 --> 01:24:03,054
And that's Karim.
- Enchanté.

1552
01:24:03,154 --> 01:24:05,040
Would you like a glass of wine?

1553
01:24:05,140 --> 01:24:08,208
Yes?

1554
01:24:08,243 --> 01:24:09,144
Let's toast.

1555
01:24:12,247 --> 01:24:13,648
No, no, no.
No crossing.

1556
01:24:13,748 --> 01:24:15,715
Go first.

1557
01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:16,651
And then the others.

1558
01:24:16,751 --> 01:24:17,652
Voilá!

1559
01:24:17,752 --> 01:24:19,154
Is that crossing if I do that?

1560
01:24:19,254 --> 01:24:21,306
No.
No, no. That's fine.

1561
01:24:21,341 --> 01:24:23,273
It's direct line.

1562
01:24:23,308 --> 01:24:25,310
We drink now.
Ha ha ha!

1563
01:24:27,812 --> 01:24:29,714
So what are you doing in Paris, Nora?

1564
01:24:29,814 --> 01:24:30,715
I'm looking for someone.

1565
01:24:30,815 --> 01:24:31,716
And did you find him?

1566
01:24:31,816 --> 01:24:33,218
No. No.

1567
01:24:33,318 --> 01:24:36,037
Well, you're not so bad right now.

1568
01:24:36,072 --> 01:24:38,438
Not bad.

1569
01:24:38,473 --> 01:24:39,724
Are all French guys like this?

1570
01:24:39,824 --> 01:24:40,725
Like what?

1571
01:24:40,825 --> 01:24:43,328
Um, passionate,
interested, uh...

1572
01:24:43,828 --> 01:24:44,729
Mm-hmm.

1573
01:24:44,829 --> 01:24:46,231
Attentive

1574
01:24:46,331 --> 01:24:48,049
but kind of like dogs, too?

1575
01:24:48,149 --> 01:24:49,284
No, no.
Dogs?

1576
01:24:49,384 --> 01:24:51,152
The women-the women are the ones, you know?

1577
01:24:51,252 --> 01:24:52,654
The last time I had a girlfriend,

1578
01:24:52,754 --> 01:24:53,655
all the time we had some fight.

1579
01:24:53,755 --> 01:24:55,651
She tried to jump out of the window

1580
01:24:55,751 --> 01:24:56,424
all the time.

1581
01:24:56,524 --> 01:24:58,293
Yeah. Ha ha!
No.

1582
01:24:58,393 --> 01:24:59,694
That was super-scary.
It wasn't funny, you know,

1583
01:24:59,794 --> 01:25:01,761
especially for me.
Sorry.

1584
01:25:01,796 --> 01:25:03,648
There's one, she tried to stop me.

1585
01:25:03,683 --> 01:25:05,500
Yeah, but that was crazy, you know.

1586
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:07,567
It's true.

1587
01:25:07,602 --> 01:25:08,710
Did you ever think that maybe you were

1588
01:25:08,810 --> 01:25:09,004
the ones

1589
01:25:09,104 --> 01:25:10,772
driving them crazy?

1590
01:25:10,872 --> 01:25:13,392
No, no, no, no.
I don't think so, no.

1591
01:25:13,608 --> 01:25:14,376
Not like this.

1592
01:25:14,476 --> 01:25:15,877
Because I've heard differently.

1593
01:25:15,977 --> 01:25:17,944
Yeah?
- Yeah.

1594
01:25:17,979 --> 01:25:20,079
Because of the French mothers.

1595
01:25:20,482 --> 01:25:21,784
What, uh-what about the French

1596
01:25:21,884 --> 01:25:22,183
mothers?

1597
01:25:22,283 --> 01:25:25,053
They, um, they're in love with their sons.

1598
01:25:25,153 --> 01:25:27,055
And the American mothers are not?

1599
01:25:27,155 --> 01:25:27,939
Not as much.

1600
01:25:28,039 --> 01:25:30,039
I think because of the food.

1601
01:25:53,014 --> 01:25:53,715
Here you go.

1602
01:25:53,815 --> 01:25:55,815
Merci.

1603
01:26:03,458 --> 01:26:05,894
Bartender: Bonsoir, monsieur.

1604
01:26:05,929 --> 01:26:07,962
Bonsoir, mademoiselle.

1605
01:26:07,997 --> 01:26:09,964
Bonsoir.

1606
01:26:10,365 --> 01:26:12,767
Are you American?

1607
01:26:12,802 --> 01:26:14,269
Yes. Why?

1608
01:26:14,369 --> 01:26:15,935
Because you look a very beautiful

1609
01:26:16,035 --> 01:26:16,671
American woman

1610
01:26:16,771 --> 01:26:19,222
sitting alone in this bar.

1611
01:26:19,574 --> 01:26:21,674
Maybe I'm waiting for someone.

1612
01:26:21,976 --> 01:26:24,379
Well, but you look alone.

1613
01:26:24,779 --> 01:26:27,947
No?

1614
01:26:27,982 --> 01:26:29,884
My name is Jean Paul Claremont.

1615
01:26:29,984 --> 01:26:31,086
What's yours?

1616
01:26:31,186 --> 01:26:32,821
Nora Wilder.

1617
01:26:32,921 --> 01:26:33,705
Nice to meet you,
Nora.

1618
01:26:33,805 --> 01:26:35,023
Nice to meet you.

1619
01:26:35,123 --> 01:26:37,058
May I offer you another drink?

1620
01:26:37,158 --> 01:26:39,561
Sure. Well,
after this one.

1621
01:26:41,563 --> 01:26:43,563
Cheers.

1622
01:26:44,365 --> 01:26:47,252
I mean, what were the chances that

1623
01:26:47,352 --> 01:26:49,070
I would find him?

1624
01:26:49,170 --> 01:26:50,672
But, you know,
the funny thing is

1625
01:26:50,772 --> 01:26:53,307
after a while I wasn't even

1626
01:26:53,407 --> 01:26:55,076
looking for Julian.

1627
01:26:55,176 --> 01:26:57,107
I was just doing my own thing,

1628
01:26:57,207 --> 01:26:58,279
and it felt good.

1629
01:26:58,379 --> 01:27:00,618
It's not wrong to want someone

1630
01:27:00,718 --> 01:27:01,883
to love you.

1631
01:27:01,983 --> 01:27:03,485
Most people are together

1632
01:27:03,585 --> 01:27:05,587
just so they are not alone,

1633
01:27:05,987 --> 01:27:09,322
but some people want magic.

1634
01:27:09,357 --> 01:27:12,560
I think you are one of those people.

1635
01:27:12,961 --> 01:27:14,062
Nothing wrong with that?

1636
01:27:14,162 --> 01:27:16,629
Nothing,
but it doesn't

1637
01:27:16,729 --> 01:27:18,967
happen all the time.

1638
01:27:19,367 --> 01:27:22,135
Does it ever happen?

1639
01:27:22,170 --> 01:27:25,373
First, Nora,
you must find love

1640
01:27:25,408 --> 01:27:27,492
and happiness in yourself.

1641
01:27:27,527 --> 01:27:31,112
Do you understand?

1642
01:27:31,513 --> 01:27:33,515
I think so.

1643
01:27:33,915 --> 01:27:37,118
Oh. We are both drunk.

1644
01:27:37,519 --> 01:27:41,122
I will put you in a taxi to your hotel.

1645
01:27:41,157 --> 01:27:43,122
It's time to go.

1646
01:27:51,933 --> 01:27:54,334
Jean Paul: Tomorrow,
you will start

1647
01:27:54,434 --> 01:27:55,437
your life again.

1648
01:27:55,537 --> 01:27:57,514
I don't know why,
but I will never

1649
01:27:57,614 --> 01:27:58,239
forget you.

1650
01:27:58,339 --> 01:28:00,241
I'll never forget you either.

1651
01:28:00,341 --> 01:28:02,341
Never.

1652
01:28:13,621 --> 01:28:14,522
Hello?

1653
01:28:14,622 --> 01:28:15,523
Hey, Nora.
It's me.

1654
01:28:15,623 --> 01:28:16,524
Audrey, hi.

1655
01:28:16,624 --> 01:28:17,525
How's it going?

1656
01:28:17,625 --> 01:28:19,394
Everything's ok.

1657
01:28:19,494 --> 01:28:20,551
I'm just leaving for the airport

1658
01:28:20,651 --> 01:28:21,396
in a couple of minutes.

1659
01:28:21,496 --> 01:28:22,197
Well, did you find him?

1660
01:28:22,297 --> 01:28:23,448
No, I didn't,
but I'm all right.

1661
01:28:23,548 --> 01:28:25,200
Really?
Yeah, I really am.

1662
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:26,434
Ok. Good.

1663
01:28:26,534 --> 01:28:27,635
Listen. I got to go,
but I'll call you

1664
01:28:27,735 --> 01:28:28,837
on the way to the airport, ok?

1665
01:28:28,937 --> 01:28:30,438
Ok. I miss you.

1666
01:28:30,538 --> 01:28:31,256
Oh, I miss you, too.

1667
01:28:31,356 --> 01:28:32,974
Fly safe, ok?
- Ok.

1668
01:28:33,074 --> 01:28:34,175
All right. Bye.

1669
01:28:34,275 --> 01:28:36,275
Bye.

1670
01:29:50,802 --> 01:29:53,054
Hi.

1671
01:29:53,304 --> 01:29:55,271
Nora.

1672
01:29:55,306 --> 01:29:56,207
I can't believe it.

1673
01:29:56,307 --> 01:29:59,275
What are you doing here?

1674
01:29:59,310 --> 01:30:01,830
Well, I'm-I'm going to a sound expo

1675
01:30:01,883 --> 01:30:03,214
at Le Bourget,

1676
01:30:03,314 --> 01:30:05,316
but what are you doing here?

1677
01:30:05,351 --> 01:30:07,318
I- I'm going to the airport.

1678
01:30:14,325 --> 01:30:17,328
What time is your flight?

1679
01:30:17,363 --> 01:30:19,328
In 3 hours.

1680
01:30:20,615 --> 01:30:22,855
They make you get to the airport

1681
01:30:22,905 --> 01:30:24,905
so early now.

1682
01:31:33,604 --> 01:31:35,604
Merci.

1683
01:31:41,763 --> 01:31:45,900
Ok. I just want to ask what you are doing here.

1684
01:31:45,935 --> 01:31:47,900
Did you come to see me?

1685
01:31:48,169 --> 01:31:49,070
Because I don't understand.

1686
01:31:49,170 --> 01:31:50,505
I like you so much,

1687
01:31:50,605 --> 01:31:52,640
and I never hear anything from you,

1688
01:31:52,740 --> 01:31:53,441
and then you are just here

1689
01:31:53,541 --> 01:31:54,792
in front of me now.

1690
01:31:54,892 --> 01:31:56,010
Why?

1691
01:31:56,110 --> 01:31:57,328
It's really complicated.

1692
01:31:57,428 --> 01:31:59,430
Ok, but try to explain.

1693
01:32:03,117 --> 01:32:05,153
I came here to find you.

1694
01:32:07,555 --> 01:32:10,925
Then I lost your number.

1695
01:32:12,944 --> 01:32:14,944
You came here to see me?

1696
01:32:18,132 --> 01:32:20,132
And you never find me?

1697
01:32:22,703 --> 01:32:24,703
But then you find me?

1698
01:32:27,942 --> 01:32:29,942
And now you leave?

1699
01:32:43,424 --> 01:32:45,424
So you like me?

1700
01:32:49,030 --> 01:32:51,030
Yes.

1701
01:32:55,236 --> 01:32:58,106
Would you stay with me for another drink?

1702
01:33:02,310 --> 01:33:05,320
But you know you're gonna miss your flight?

1703
01:33:06,714 --> 01:33:08,714
I know.

1704
01:33:27,301 --> 01:33:29,804
...could have come through?

1705
01:33:32,306 --> 01:33:34,306
Anytime

1706
01:33:35,810 --> 01:33:37,812
Cold, lonely

1707
01:33:39,814 --> 01:33:42,817
puritan.

1708
01:33:43,317 --> 01:33:45,820
What are you

1709
01:33:47,822 --> 01:33:51,325
fighting for?

1710
01:33:51,826 --> 01:33:53,828
It's not my

1711
01:33:55,329 --> 01:33:58,798
security.

1712
01:33:58,833 --> 01:34:02,837
It's just an old war

1713
01:34:02,872 --> 01:34:06,806
not even a cold war

1714
01:34:06,841 --> 01:34:10,845
Don't say it in Russian.

1715
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:16,868
Don't say it in German

1716
01:34:16,903 --> 01:34:29,864
say it in broken English

1717
01:34:39,373 --> 01:34:41,373
lose your father

1718
01:34:43,377 --> 01:34:45,880
your husband

1719
01:34:47,381 --> 01:34:49,383
your mother

1720
01:34:51,385 --> 01:34:53,888
your children

1721
01:34:55,389 --> 01:34:57,391
what are you

1722
01:34:59,894 --> 01:35:01,896
dying for?

1723
01:35:03,397 --> 01:35:05,399
It's not my

1724
01:35:07,401 --> 01:35:10,369
reality.

1725
01:35:10,404 --> 01:35:14,408
It's just an old war

1726
01:35:14,443 --> 01:35:18,377
not even a cold war

1727
01:35:18,412 --> 01:35:22,416
don't say it in Russian

1728
01:35:22,451 --> 01:35:28,690
don't say it in German

1729
01:35:28,725 --> 01:35:41,936
say it in broken English

1730
01:35:42,937 --> 01:35:57,952
what are you fighting for?

1731
01:36:06,961 --> 01:36:09,463
could have come through?

1732
01:36:11,966 --> 01:36:13,968
anytime

1733
01:36:15,469 --> 01:36:17,471
cold, lonely

1734
01:36:19,974 --> 01:36:23,442
puritan

1735
01:36:23,477 --> 01:36:25,479
what are you

1736
01:36:27,982 --> 01:36:30,734
fighting for?

1737
01:36:31,485 --> 01:36:33,487
It's not my

1738
01:36:35,489 --> 01:36:38,457
security

1739
01:36:38,492 --> 01:36:42,496
It's just an old war

1740
01:36:42,531 --> 01:36:46,465
not even a cold war

1741
01:36:46,500 --> 01:36:50,504
don't say it in Russian

1742
01:36:50,539 --> 01:36:54,508
don't say it in German

1743
01:36:55,009 --> 01:37:05,019
say it in broken English

1744
01:37:05,054 --> 01:37:29,543
what are you fighting for?
