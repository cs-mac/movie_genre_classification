1
00:00:07,929 --> 00:00:08,929
Hae Joo.

2
00:00:09,169 --> 00:00:10,929
- Say something.
- Mom.

3
00:00:11,499 --> 00:00:13,069
How could you?

4
00:00:13,569 --> 00:00:15,369
How could you sell our company's design...

5
00:00:15,739 --> 00:00:17,879
to a counterfeiter?

6
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:21,479
- Hae Joo.
- And you're Wid Group's madam?

7
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:23,849
I'm very disappointed in you.

8
00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:33,159
Koo Do Chi lost his position
and is awaiting assignment,

9
00:00:33,389 --> 00:00:35,729
and Son Yuh Ri from the
design team was fired.

10
00:00:37,429 --> 00:00:38,599
Do Young.

11
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:41,029
It's been a while since you did as I say.

12
00:00:42,129 --> 00:00:43,799
I guess he was afraid...

13
00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:45,249
of the company being prosecuted.

14
00:00:47,499 --> 00:00:50,069
Did you hire workers and have
them wait outside as I asked?

15
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:52,879
- I did.
- Okay. Wait outside.

16
00:00:58,149 --> 00:01:00,425
Do Chi and Yuh Ri, stumbling blocks...

17
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:02,619
to Hae Joo's success have been removed.

18
00:01:04,289 --> 00:01:05,389
It's Ji Won's next.

19
00:01:06,619 --> 00:01:09,359
I just need to remove her now.

20
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:16,469
Hae Joo. How could you do this to me?

21
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,839
Anyone who damages the
company's reputation...

22
00:01:19,169 --> 00:01:20,539
cannot be forgiven.

23
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,739
Even if it is you.

24
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:25,909
I'm done talking.

25
00:01:26,139 --> 00:01:27,479
Get out of my sight!

26
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:30,609
Don't do this to me based
just on Do Chi's words.

27
00:01:30,849 --> 00:01:33,379
That recording could've been faked!

28
00:01:34,279 --> 00:01:36,319
We knew you'd keep denying it,

29
00:01:36,449 --> 00:01:38,089
so we brought the witness.

30
00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:39,659
Come in!

31
00:01:49,329 --> 00:01:50,369
This man...

32
00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:53,199
circulated our design in Dongdaemun.

33
00:01:55,139 --> 00:01:57,369
Who's the one who gave you our design?

34
00:01:57,809 --> 00:01:59,729
Who ordered you to sell
our dress at the market?

35
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,819
Tell me. Who is the one...

36
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:12,619
who gave you our design?

37
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,329
This woman.

38
00:02:16,729 --> 00:02:18,159
What? What did you say?

39
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:21,399
Hey, you. Do you know me?

40
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:24,469
Have you seen me before?

41
00:02:24,869 --> 00:02:26,498
When? Where?

42
00:02:26,499 --> 00:02:28,209
I've never seen you before!

43
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:34,709
Who is it? Who told you to blame me?
Tell me!

44
00:02:34,809 --> 00:02:36,679
That's enough! Shut your mouth.

45
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:39,619
Stop denying it.

46
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:42,019
We have a witness.

47
00:02:42,249 --> 00:02:43,865
Denying won't accomplish anything.

48
00:02:43,889 --> 00:02:46,089
I've never met this man before!

49
00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:49,789
Now that we found the culprit,

50
00:02:49,929 --> 00:02:52,329
please cancel Yuh Ri's and
my termination and transfer.

51
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:54,929
That's not right.

52
00:02:55,669 --> 00:02:57,629
The thief isn't the only one at fault.

53
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:01,109
You're also at fault for being careless.

54
00:03:01,369 --> 00:03:02,369
Hae Joo.

55
00:03:02,839 --> 00:03:04,539
It's a premeditated crime.

56
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:06,409
Don't try to blame the victim!

57
00:03:06,779 --> 00:03:09,509
Uncle. Accept the result.

58
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:12,749
Dad. You can't cancel Yuh
and Uncle Do Chi's...

59
00:03:12,849 --> 00:03:14,249
termination and transfer.

60
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:17,759
Dad. Mr. Chairman.

61
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:18,989
That's enough!

62
00:03:19,789 --> 00:03:22,159
For now, the termination
and transfer are on hold.

63
00:03:22,629 --> 00:03:24,159
Now everyone get out!

64
00:03:29,469 --> 00:03:31,599
Ji Won! You stay!

65
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:40,809
Look. Who are you?

66
00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:42,925
Who told you to frame me?

67
00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:43,979
Stop it!

68
00:03:45,649 --> 00:03:48,319
Just how low will you go?

69
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:50,988
Is your head filled only
with conspiracies, schemes,

70
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:52,289
and dirty tricks?

71
00:03:56,289 --> 00:03:59,099
What is this mess?

72
00:03:59,899 --> 00:04:01,399
Hae Joo and Do Chi...

73
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,199
were competing to succeed the
chairman to run Wid Group.

74
00:04:04,329 --> 00:04:06,599
Ji Won gave that man our team's design...

75
00:04:06,999 --> 00:04:09,409
in order to eliminate Do Chi and me.

76
00:04:10,409 --> 00:04:13,609
She made counterfeits of our
dress to fill the market,

77
00:04:14,279 --> 00:04:16,309
in order to hurt Do Chi and me.

78
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:19,449
Ji Won did something like that?

79
00:04:21,689 --> 00:04:22,989
I can't believe it.

80
00:04:23,149 --> 00:04:24,459
I told you.

81
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:27,319
Ji Won is a frightening woman.

82
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:30,029
Don't see her again.

83
00:04:30,329 --> 00:04:32,359
Who knows what she'll do to you?

84
00:04:32,729 --> 00:04:35,569
But why were you at the office?

85
00:04:36,329 --> 00:04:37,329
What?

86
00:04:39,939 --> 00:04:40,939
This is it.

87
00:04:42,069 --> 00:04:43,939
Where I left my baby.

88
00:04:45,179 --> 00:04:46,179
Here?

89
00:04:52,149 --> 00:04:53,219
What's wrong?

90
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,389
Do you remember something?

91
00:04:57,619 --> 00:04:59,089
The thing is...

92
00:05:01,529 --> 00:05:02,559
It's obvious.

93
00:05:02,829 --> 00:05:03,905
You'll say...

94
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:06,659
you wanted to get rid of
Do Chi and help Hae Joo.

95
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:09,528
Even if you did it for Hae Joo,

96
00:05:09,529 --> 00:05:10,605
I can't forgive you!

97
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:12,139
It wasn't my plan.

98
00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:15,309
- Believe me.
- If not you? Then who?

99
00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:16,509
It was...

100
00:05:17,539 --> 00:05:19,409
You've tried my patience.

101
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:21,879
You've crossed the point of no return.

102
00:05:22,349 --> 00:05:24,749
I was patient with you for
Hae Joo's sake until now,

103
00:05:25,019 --> 00:05:26,019
but no more.

104
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:28,289
Pack your things and get out of my house!

105
00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:30,119
No! Why should I?

106
00:05:31,619 --> 00:05:34,489
If it's about the damage the company
incurred, I'll compensate you.

107
00:05:35,659 --> 00:05:37,835
I'll take responsibility for
the products discarded,

108
00:05:37,859 --> 00:05:40,498
and I'll sell the land in my name...

109
00:05:40,499 --> 00:05:42,999
- and compensate...
- This isn't about the money!

110
00:05:43,769 --> 00:05:47,169
I can't let someone like you
remain in our house. Get out.

111
00:05:47,299 --> 00:05:49,339
- Honey.
- If you don't leave,

112
00:05:49,939 --> 00:05:50,939
I'll drag you out.

113
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:07,559
How could you?

114
00:06:08,229 --> 00:06:10,059
How could you sell our company's design...

115
00:06:10,489 --> 00:06:12,699
to a counterfeiter?

116
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:16,229
- Hae Joo.
- And you're Wid Group's madam?

117
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:18,469
I'm very disappointed in you.

118
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,009
Why did Hae Joo suddenly
throw me under the bus?

119
00:06:22,409 --> 00:06:24,709
I did all of this because she asked me to.

120
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:26,139
Ji Won.

121
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:30,809
I'm very disappointed.

122
00:06:31,619 --> 00:06:33,619
Do you see only Hae Joo
and not the company?

123
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:35,889
How could you ruin the company to help her?

124
00:06:35,989 --> 00:06:38,059
I never saw that man before.

125
00:06:38,489 --> 00:06:40,089
And he didn't know what I looked like.

126
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,259
He didn't know what you looked like.

127
00:06:43,559 --> 00:06:46,259
As in, you never met him,

128
00:06:46,729 --> 00:06:49,045
but you admit to giving him
the design, is that it?

129
00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:50,299
I did no such thing.

130
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,409
You must have schemed this
in order to get rid of me.

131
00:06:54,809 --> 00:06:55,839
Dream on.

132
00:06:56,409 --> 00:06:58,239
Once Wid Group becomes Hae Joo's,

133
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:01,509
she'll kick the two of
you out without fail.

134
00:07:08,549 --> 00:07:11,689
That's right. Let's see the
mother and daughter fight.

135
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:13,419
Both of you...

136
00:07:14,089 --> 00:07:15,859
will be kicked out of the company...

137
00:07:16,359 --> 00:07:18,299
and the house. I'll make sure of it.

138
00:07:23,269 --> 00:07:24,399
Did you get to the house?

139
00:07:25,569 --> 00:07:27,239
Okay. I'm busy too.

140
00:07:33,009 --> 00:07:34,685
Hae Joo told you that I was coming, right?

141
00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:36,509
- Yes.
- Where's Ji Won's room?

142
00:07:36,649 --> 00:07:38,179
She's staying in that room.

143
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:41,219
Go in and remove all of her things.
Right now.

144
00:07:41,549 --> 00:07:42,549
Yes, ma'am.

145
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,589
How did it go? Did you catch the culprit?

146
00:07:46,989 --> 00:07:48,659
- We did.
- Yes.

147
00:07:49,329 --> 00:07:52,129
Then the termination and
transfer were canceled, right?

148
00:07:52,729 --> 00:07:55,569
Just because we caught the culprit
doesn't excuse us from all fault.

149
00:07:56,499 --> 00:07:59,398
Regardless, we were
careless with the design.

150
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:02,309
We must change the chairman's
mind about basing his decision...

151
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:04,399
- on who should succeed him on this.
- Of course.

152
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,079
We couldn't compete fairly
because Ji Won cheated.

153
00:08:08,179 --> 00:08:10,979
But wasn't Hae Joo acting strange?

154
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:14,788
Ji Won clearly did it for her,

155
00:08:14,789 --> 00:08:16,249
but she shunned her,

156
00:08:16,589 --> 00:08:18,489
and turned her back to her.

157
00:08:18,689 --> 00:08:21,489
Ji Won could not have acted alone.

158
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:26,199
She couldn't have gotten our
design without Hae Joo's help.

159
00:08:28,369 --> 00:08:29,729
Have you reached Yul Mae yet?

160
00:08:30,569 --> 00:08:32,809
She turned off her phone and
has completely disappeared.

161
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:36,409
What will you do about Angela
Choi pressing charges...

162
00:08:36,509 --> 00:08:37,509
against the two of you?

163
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,485
Now that we found the culprit, we
should explain what happened...

164
00:08:40,509 --> 00:08:42,149
and ask her not to press charges.

165
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:43,885
Let's go see her now.

166
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:45,119
She must be in her apartment.

167
00:08:50,689 --> 00:08:51,719
Ji Won.

168
00:08:52,659 --> 00:08:54,095
Were you living...

169
00:08:54,119 --> 00:08:56,659
in this tiny study in
this palace of a house?

170
00:08:58,359 --> 00:08:59,759
You poor thing.

171
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:02,069
I'm sorry.

172
00:09:02,529 --> 00:09:03,529
Wait.

173
00:09:10,069 --> 00:09:13,479
Is this Do Young's and Ji Won's son?

174
00:09:17,719 --> 00:09:19,279
It's Ji Won when she was young.

175
00:09:20,049 --> 00:09:21,249
Who's this?

176
00:09:21,449 --> 00:09:22,619
It isn't Hae Joo.

177
00:09:26,789 --> 00:09:28,689
Is this the baby that she abandoned?

178
00:09:29,059 --> 00:09:30,459
What are you doing?

179
00:09:33,599 --> 00:09:35,345
What are you doing in my house?

180
00:09:35,369 --> 00:09:37,099
It'll be my house starting tomorrow,

181
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:38,699
so I came to look around.

182
00:09:38,969 --> 00:09:41,469
What are you talking about? Your house?

183
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:45,679
The furniture lacks any sense of style.

184
00:09:45,939 --> 00:09:48,848
But then again, you need to
have seen them growing up...

185
00:09:48,849 --> 00:09:50,679
to develop a taste for them.

186
00:09:50,809 --> 00:09:52,249
I'll have to change them all.

187
00:09:52,419 --> 00:09:55,619
Why are you complaining about the
furniture after trespassing?

188
00:09:58,819 --> 00:10:00,789
I heard you stole my design.

189
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:02,629
Your design?

190
00:10:02,789 --> 00:10:04,959
The design you circulated in Dongdaemun.

191
00:10:06,329 --> 00:10:08,975
It was a collaboration I did with Do Chi...

192
00:10:08,999 --> 00:10:10,399
and Yuh Ri.

193
00:10:11,139 --> 00:10:13,739
I'm the designer Angela Choi!

194
00:10:15,209 --> 00:10:17,409
Angela Choi was you?

195
00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:18,779
While I was gone,

196
00:10:19,239 --> 00:10:21,549
you stole my husband Do Young, and now,

197
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:23,709
you steal my design too?

198
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,649
It must be because you grew up poor.

199
00:10:26,779 --> 00:10:28,389
Stealing is ingrained in you.

200
00:10:29,789 --> 00:10:32,819
You won't be Wid Group's madam much longer,

201
00:10:33,289 --> 00:10:35,159
so enjoy it all you can today.

202
00:10:36,229 --> 00:10:38,729
I'll see you off nicely when you step down.

203
00:10:39,199 --> 00:10:41,199
Ms. Ahn!

204
00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:43,569
Yes, madam.

205
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:45,339
Who let this woman in?

206
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,038
Why are you...

207
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:49,009
letting random people in as you please?

208
00:10:49,239 --> 00:10:50,439
Kick her out right now!

209
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,709
I told her to let her in.

210
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,179
- Hae Joo.
- I called her here.

211
00:10:57,649 --> 00:11:00,179
I called my real mom into my house.

212
00:11:01,319 --> 00:11:03,219
Hae... Hae Joo.

213
00:11:12,299 --> 00:11:14,529
Angela Cho still isn't picking up.

214
00:11:16,469 --> 00:11:19,039
Maybe she's avoiding us because
of the charges against us.

215
00:11:27,009 --> 00:11:29,609
- Hello?
- This is terrible.

216
00:11:30,009 --> 00:11:31,119
What is it?

217
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:35,049
Madam is about to get
kicked out of the house.

218
00:11:35,189 --> 00:11:37,348
I can't reach the chairman,

219
00:11:37,349 --> 00:11:39,289
so I'm calling you instead.

220
00:11:42,029 --> 00:11:43,289
Let's go home first.

221
00:11:43,389 --> 00:11:45,259
Ji Won must be fighting with someone.

222
00:11:47,359 --> 00:11:48,399
Hae Joo.

223
00:11:48,969 --> 00:11:50,499
You were like this earlier too.

224
00:11:50,999 --> 00:11:52,499
Why are you doing this to me?

225
00:11:53,169 --> 00:11:54,169
Is it...

226
00:11:54,509 --> 00:11:56,239
because of Ga Ya?

227
00:11:56,969 --> 00:11:57,979
That's right.

228
00:11:59,079 --> 00:12:00,979
You know, since you've lost a child too.

229
00:12:02,409 --> 00:12:05,049
Just as you can't forgive
Yuh Ri because of Hae Sung,

230
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:07,219
I can never forgive you.

231
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:10,319
It's a completely different
situation than with Yuh Ri.

232
00:12:10,719 --> 00:12:12,919
I did my best to save Ga Ya.

233
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:14,429
There was nothing I wouldn't do.

234
00:12:14,689 --> 00:12:15,759
Had I known...

235
00:12:15,889 --> 00:12:18,675
that Mee Hee was a match with Ga Ya,

236
00:12:18,699 --> 00:12:20,628
I would've looked for her first.

237
00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:22,029
Who would believe you?

238
00:12:22,329 --> 00:12:23,845
Regardless, the results are the same.

239
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:26,299
You're the one who killed Ga Ya.

240
00:12:27,139 --> 00:12:29,609
If you hadn't stopped my
birth mom from meeting me,

241
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,009
Ga Ya would've lived.

242
00:12:31,939 --> 00:12:34,139
I never knew you'd think that way.

243
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:38,119
I had faith that you'd
know how I truly felt.

244
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:40,549
If you understand my pain
even in the slightest,

245
00:12:41,119 --> 00:12:42,489
leave this house quietly.

246
00:12:43,119 --> 00:12:45,189
If you care at all about me,

247
00:12:46,359 --> 00:12:48,429
don't torment me by
making me see your face.

248
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:51,199
Fine.

249
00:12:52,299 --> 00:12:54,219
If that's what you want,
I'll leave for a while.

250
00:12:54,969 --> 00:12:56,229
But...

251
00:12:56,469 --> 00:12:59,899
I was sincere about everything
I've done for you and Ga Ya.

252
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:01,339
Please believe me.

253
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:06,409
Hae Joo.

254
00:13:07,439 --> 00:13:08,609
Do you see this?

255
00:13:09,849 --> 00:13:11,749
- What is that?
- Give that back!

256
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:14,789
The picture of the real daughter...

257
00:13:14,949 --> 00:13:16,149
of the woman you call "Mom."

258
00:13:19,489 --> 00:13:22,489
He had been hiding it very well.

259
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:24,975
She was cherishing this photo...

260
00:13:24,999 --> 00:13:26,958
and probably looked at it all the time...

261
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,399
as she longed for her real daughter.

262
00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:31,999
You were nothing but a substitute...

263
00:13:32,369 --> 00:13:33,568
for the daughter she lost.

264
00:13:33,569 --> 00:13:36,969
That's not true! I never considered
Hae Joo to be her replacement.

265
00:13:37,109 --> 00:13:38,209
Don't try to tear us apart!

266
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,349
You lost that child, right?

267
00:13:42,709 --> 00:13:44,209
If she finds this child,

268
00:13:44,619 --> 00:13:48,019
she'll discard you like yesterday's trash.

269
00:13:50,349 --> 00:13:52,819
You acted like you cared so
much about me to my face,

270
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:54,589
but you were...

271
00:13:55,129 --> 00:13:56,829
longing for your daughter behind my back?

272
00:13:57,029 --> 00:13:59,029
Hae Joo. That's not true.

273
00:13:59,699 --> 00:14:00,759
Get out.

274
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:03,229
Drag her out of here.

275
00:14:03,569 --> 00:14:05,838
Hae Joo! Don't fall for her lies.

276
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,339
You were all I had!

277
00:14:07,439 --> 00:14:09,439
Hae Joo! It isn't true!

278
00:14:09,909 --> 00:14:11,039
Hae Joo!

279
00:14:18,019 --> 00:14:19,019
It's Ji Won.

280
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,749
Angela Choi is with her.

281
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:23,319
- Hae Joo.
- Why is Angela Choi here?

282
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:26,659
Is she fighting with Ji Won?

283
00:14:27,219 --> 00:14:29,459
Hae Joo. Please listen to your mom.

284
00:14:29,589 --> 00:14:32,029
- You have to believe me.
- I don't want to hear it.

285
00:14:33,529 --> 00:14:34,599
Hae Joo.

286
00:14:37,329 --> 00:14:38,999
Put this all over Dongdaemun.

287
00:14:39,239 --> 00:14:40,539
It's a women's clothing design.

288
00:14:42,609 --> 00:14:43,639
Did you...

289
00:14:44,309 --> 00:14:46,639
ask me to circulate the design...

290
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:48,809
in order to get rid of me?

291
00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:53,249
That's right. I'll be honest,
given the circumstances.

292
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:56,819
I can't bear to look at you any longer.

293
00:14:57,219 --> 00:14:58,259
It pains me.

294
00:14:59,019 --> 00:15:02,229
Seeing you reminds me of Ga
Ya, and it drives me crazy.

295
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,299
That's why I want to get
you out of my sight.

296
00:15:12,339 --> 00:15:13,859
I'll send you the rest of your things.

297
00:15:14,269 --> 00:15:15,269
Please leave quietly.

298
00:15:17,469 --> 00:15:18,479
Okay.

299
00:15:19,479 --> 00:15:20,779
If that's how you feel,

300
00:15:21,809 --> 00:15:23,679
I should leave your sight.

301
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:27,479
But don't believe that woman Mee Hee.

302
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:29,219
She left you.

303
00:15:29,389 --> 00:15:32,119
Who's to say she won't abandon you again?

304
00:15:32,359 --> 00:15:33,659
I'll take care of that.

305
00:15:55,549 --> 00:15:56,549
Good job.

306
00:15:57,249 --> 00:16:00,149
You have to be prepared to bleed
this much to get what you want.

307
00:16:00,749 --> 00:16:02,989
We kicked Do Chi and Yuh
Ri out of the company,

308
00:16:03,319 --> 00:16:05,059
and Ji Won from the house.

309
00:16:06,989 --> 00:16:08,329
Leaking my design...

310
00:16:08,529 --> 00:16:10,189
was detrimental to me,

311
00:16:10,459 --> 00:16:12,399
but I'll gladly accept it for you.

312
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:14,629
Let's go in.

313
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,579
Angela Choi is Hae Joo's birth mom.

314
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:28,749
It was all Hae Joo's doing.

315
00:16:30,109 --> 00:16:33,025
She used Ji Won to leak our design,

316
00:16:33,049 --> 00:16:35,348
and used Angela Choi to
press charges against us...

317
00:16:35,349 --> 00:16:36,819
to kick us out of the company.

318
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:40,195
Ji Won was just a pawn.

319
00:16:40,219 --> 00:16:42,329
Hae Joo was the one controlling her.

320
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,799
She used both of her moms
to achieve her goal.

321
00:16:56,409 --> 00:16:59,539
(Love Orphanage)

322
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:14,089
No.

323
00:17:15,729 --> 00:17:18,159
Yuh Ri couldn't be the daughter
that Ji Won abandoned.

324
00:17:19,999 --> 00:17:21,169
Grandpa.

325
00:17:22,129 --> 00:17:24,269
Hi, Bom. What is it?

326
00:17:25,899 --> 00:17:27,539
I drew you.

327
00:17:27,969 --> 00:17:30,469
Wow. Bom.

328
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:33,609
You're a good artist, just like your mom.

329
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:35,949
I'm lucky that I take after Mom.

330
00:17:36,249 --> 00:17:39,749
I think it's because I
had my lucky birthmark.

331
00:17:39,979 --> 00:17:40,979
Lucky birthmark?

332
00:17:43,789 --> 00:17:46,458
I had a birthmark the shape
of a four-leaf clover...

333
00:17:46,459 --> 00:17:48,089
on my waist before.

334
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:52,359
Although we had it removed,
so all I have is a scar now.

335
00:17:52,459 --> 00:17:53,459
A scar?

336
00:17:57,429 --> 00:17:59,539
Let's get surgery once you start college.

337
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:01,639
It looks bad.

338
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:03,145
It wasn't bad enough...

339
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:05,309
that she gave that baby a burn scar.

340
00:18:05,939 --> 00:18:08,849
She left the baby on the cold
floor in the dead of winter...

341
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:10,479
which killed the baby.

342
00:18:10,909 --> 00:18:13,549
So she wailed, punching
herself in the chest.

343
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,349
No.

344
00:18:17,619 --> 00:18:18,719
It couldn't be.

345
00:18:19,889 --> 00:18:21,229
Not Yuh Ri.

346
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:25,499
- We're home.
- Where is everyone?

347
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:28,099
Bom. Mommy and Great-uncle are home.

348
00:18:33,139 --> 00:18:34,169
Bom.

349
00:18:34,969 --> 00:18:37,409
- Welcome home.
- My baby.

350
00:18:39,909 --> 00:18:42,579
Father. Is something bothering you?

351
00:18:43,009 --> 00:18:44,309
You look concerned.

352
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:48,239
Is it because of what happened
earlier at the office?

353
00:18:49,549 --> 00:18:50,549
Yuh Ri.

354
00:18:51,389 --> 00:18:52,959
If I remember correctly,

355
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:55,959
you had a burn scar on your shoulder.

356
00:18:56,329 --> 00:18:57,359
That's right.

357
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:00,259
I had a burn scar on my shoulder
ever since I was a child.

358
00:19:00,729 --> 00:19:01,998
But not anymore.

359
00:19:01,999 --> 00:19:03,669
I got surgery to remove it.

360
00:19:05,069 --> 00:19:06,599
Why do you ask?

361
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:09,839
No, nothing. Never mind.

362
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:12,939
Yuh Ri couldn't be Ji Won's daughter.

363
00:19:14,009 --> 00:19:15,179
There's no way.

364
00:19:29,259 --> 00:19:30,459
Why are you coming from there?

365
00:19:31,999 --> 00:19:33,279
I was looking at the empty room.

366
00:19:33,699 --> 00:19:34,869
Where's your mom?

367
00:19:35,669 --> 00:19:36,829
She left.

368
00:19:37,529 --> 00:19:39,699
Mother left? What do you mean?

369
00:19:40,269 --> 00:19:41,839
I'm tired. I'm going to bed.

370
00:20:00,259 --> 00:20:01,289
What happened?

371
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:03,659
Why did your mother suddenly move out?

372
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:05,759
I kicked her out.

373
00:20:06,529 --> 00:20:09,229
Seeing her face drove me crazy
because it made me think of Ga Ya.

374
00:20:10,029 --> 00:20:11,399
If it weren't for her,

375
00:20:11,939 --> 00:20:13,339
Ga Ya would've lived.

376
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:16,809
What? Even still,

377
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,279
she raised you as her
own for over 30 years.

378
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:23,649
How could you turn your back
on her so coldly like this?

379
00:20:26,219 --> 00:20:28,049
What is it? Tell me.

380
00:20:28,449 --> 00:20:29,919
This isn't just about Ga Ya.

381
00:20:30,049 --> 00:20:31,889
You're hiding something
from her, aren't you?

382
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:35,129
I am not. Stop imagining things.

383
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,369
- Hello?
- I've found him.

384
00:20:44,969 --> 00:20:47,569
The man who was watching
Son Joo Ho for Ms. Koo.

385
00:20:48,739 --> 00:20:50,169
I want to meet him tomorrow.

386
00:20:52,639 --> 00:20:53,679
Hae Joo.

387
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:56,599
There's definitely something there
between you and your mother.

388
00:20:56,879 --> 00:20:57,919
Otherwise,

389
00:20:58,449 --> 00:21:00,619
you couldn't do this to her.

390
00:21:03,989 --> 00:21:04,989
Yul Mae?

391
00:21:06,189 --> 00:21:07,889
I haven't heard from her yet.

392
00:21:09,489 --> 00:21:11,759
Okay. Bye.

393
00:21:15,029 --> 00:21:17,469
What is it? Was it Yuh Ri again?

394
00:21:18,869 --> 00:21:19,869
Yes.

395
00:21:20,199 --> 00:21:23,239
She begged me to call her
if I hear from Yul Mae.

396
00:21:23,539 --> 00:21:25,679
I think something serious is up.

397
00:21:26,809 --> 00:21:28,779
What did she do?

398
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:30,279
Forget this.

399
00:21:32,549 --> 00:21:34,119
The phone has been turned off.

400
00:21:34,249 --> 00:21:36,419
That brat. I can't reach her.

401
00:21:36,549 --> 00:21:37,618
Where is she?

402
00:21:37,619 --> 00:21:39,559
I haven't slept in my own bed for days.

403
00:21:39,959 --> 00:21:41,659
My body feels so stiff.

404
00:21:42,829 --> 00:21:44,659
Should I ask Hae Joo to send me money?

405
00:21:48,129 --> 00:21:50,069
Wait. Over there.

406
00:21:50,629 --> 00:21:53,739
That girl walking with her
behind swaying side by side...

407
00:21:54,239 --> 00:21:55,569
looks like Yul Mae.

408
00:21:56,209 --> 00:21:58,079
Yul Mae! Kim Yul Mae!

409
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:00,809
Mom!

410
00:22:06,019 --> 00:22:07,195
We found Yul Mae.

411
00:22:07,219 --> 00:22:09,789
We're taking her to Ae Nok's store now.

412
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:12,989
Oliver just texted. They found Yul Mae.

413
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:15,129
- Okay. Let's go.
- Okay.

414
00:22:17,459 --> 00:22:18,928
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

415
00:22:18,929 --> 00:22:20,159
Have a nice day.

416
00:22:24,699 --> 00:22:25,999
The public loves it.

417
00:22:26,369 --> 00:22:29,069
The other locations said your design...

418
00:22:29,369 --> 00:22:31,239
is flying off the shelves too.

419
00:22:31,779 --> 00:22:34,725
This is enough to show what
I'm capable of, right?

420
00:22:34,749 --> 00:22:35,749
Of course.

421
00:22:36,349 --> 00:22:37,849
You'll win for sure.

422
00:22:40,249 --> 00:22:42,789
Once I get back to the office,
I'm going to tell my dad...

423
00:22:43,249 --> 00:22:45,259
to make me his successor.

424
00:22:55,099 --> 00:22:57,199
Okay. I'll head there now.

425
00:22:59,439 --> 00:23:00,968
I need to stop by somewhere.

426
00:23:00,969 --> 00:23:02,109
See you back at the office.

427
00:23:13,049 --> 00:23:14,179
I'll get to the point.

428
00:23:14,989 --> 00:23:17,619
You're the one who was
watching Son Joo Ho...

429
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:20,259
- at Haneul Hospital, correct?
- That's right.

430
00:23:20,589 --> 00:23:23,029
Koo Hae Joo, the person who hired you,

431
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:24,259
is my wife.

432
00:23:25,059 --> 00:23:27,845
And I called you here
because I wanted to know...

433
00:23:27,869 --> 00:23:30,469
what you've done for my wife.

434
00:23:36,509 --> 00:23:38,009
This should be enough.

435
00:23:43,449 --> 00:23:44,449
Well,

436
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:46,779
I had to watch Son Joo Ho,

437
00:23:47,419 --> 00:23:49,849
and she had me run some DNA tests.

438
00:23:51,259 --> 00:23:52,559
DNA tests?

439
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:55,389
Whose DNA did you test?

440
00:23:56,759 --> 00:23:59,899
The names were Son Joo Ho, Son Yuh Ri,

441
00:24:00,859 --> 00:24:02,369
and Hong Ji Won.

442
00:24:04,199 --> 00:24:06,399
Who? Hong Ji Won?

443
00:24:07,269 --> 00:24:09,609
Why did she run a DNA test
on Ji Won and Yuh Ri?

444
00:24:10,339 --> 00:24:11,339
For what?

445
00:24:12,779 --> 00:24:15,279
Can you get another copy...

446
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:16,979
of the DNA test results?

447
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:24,919
(Human DNA Testing Center)

448
00:24:37,029 --> 00:24:40,399
Yuh Ri and Ji Won are mother and child?

449
00:24:41,709 --> 00:24:42,909
How?

450
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:45,879
That's why...

451
00:24:46,939 --> 00:24:48,949
Hae Joo turned her back on her mother?

452
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:56,249
Is there a chance that Yuh Ri...

453
00:24:57,319 --> 00:24:59,619
is Ji Won's daughter?

454
00:25:08,069 --> 00:25:09,129
It's me.

455
00:25:09,869 --> 00:25:11,569
Hi. I'm glad you called.

456
00:25:11,999 --> 00:25:14,839
I wanted to meet and ask you something.

457
00:25:16,569 --> 00:25:18,739
Okay. I'll come to you.

458
00:25:19,239 --> 00:25:20,239
Here.

459
00:25:21,749 --> 00:25:25,225
It's the famous Yoon Ki Dong
brand cold bean soup noodles.

460
00:25:25,249 --> 00:25:26,778
Did you remember the hot peppers?

461
00:25:26,779 --> 00:25:29,865
Naturally. I got the hottest ones,

462
00:25:29,889 --> 00:25:31,859
just as you like them.

463
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:34,759
- Here they are.
- Great job.

464
00:25:35,089 --> 00:25:38,199
My husband is the absolute best.

465
00:25:41,629 --> 00:25:43,529
Are you going somewhere?

466
00:25:44,129 --> 00:25:45,539
I need some air.

467
00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:48,269
I thought I'd walk around
again like yesterday.

468
00:25:48,669 --> 00:25:51,138
Why don't you eat first? I
just pulled the noodles.

469
00:25:51,139 --> 00:25:53,309
I'm fine. I'll eat when I get back.

470
00:25:54,139 --> 00:25:55,209
Also,

471
00:25:56,409 --> 00:25:57,649
I think...

472
00:25:58,279 --> 00:26:00,249
I may get my memory back soon.

473
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:02,089
Something very important.

474
00:26:03,849 --> 00:26:06,389
If I do, I'll tell you everything.

475
00:26:06,489 --> 00:26:08,229
Enjoy your lunch.

476
00:26:15,499 --> 00:26:16,499
Ms. Koo.

477
00:26:17,029 --> 00:26:18,469
Here are the sales figures...

478
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:20,499
and the contracts with buyers abroad...

479
00:26:20,639 --> 00:26:22,869
that you asked for.

480
00:26:23,409 --> 00:26:25,785
This is more than enough to make up...

481
00:26:25,809 --> 00:26:28,509
for the loss Yuh Ri's
team caused the company.

482
00:26:29,449 --> 00:26:31,049
- Good job.
- Thank you.

483
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:34,049
Did you see that?

484
00:26:34,449 --> 00:26:36,119
Yuh Ri. You can't beat me.

485
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:39,759
- I'm going to see the chairman.
- Yes, ma'am.

486
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:45,959
I'm going to my dad.

487
00:26:46,259 --> 00:26:48,169
I'll show him how well our team is doing,

488
00:26:48,269 --> 00:26:49,969
and ask that he make me his successor.

489
00:26:50,199 --> 00:26:52,799
- Go with me.
- We need to talk first.

490
00:26:57,809 --> 00:26:59,679
What is it?

491
00:27:00,509 --> 00:27:01,825
Let's talk later.

492
00:27:01,849 --> 00:27:03,209
- I want to...
- Is Yuh Ri...

493
00:27:03,579 --> 00:27:04,919
your mother's daughter?

494
00:27:07,249 --> 00:27:09,689
- Is Yuh Ri your mother's daughter?
- Keep it down.

495
00:27:10,189 --> 00:27:11,689
Do you want the whole world to know?

496
00:27:12,389 --> 00:27:13,389
Answer me.

497
00:27:14,859 --> 00:27:15,859
She is.

498
00:27:16,689 --> 00:27:17,799
Yuh Ri is Mom's daughter.

499
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:19,599
The daughter Mom abandoned.

500
00:27:19,729 --> 00:27:21,329
The daughter Mom thought has died.

501
00:27:22,029 --> 00:27:24,169
Yuh Ri is that daughter.

502
00:27:25,469 --> 00:27:26,639
She isn't related...

503
00:27:27,169 --> 00:27:28,769
to Mr. Joo Ho at all.

504
00:27:30,339 --> 00:27:31,379
Honey.

505
00:27:32,179 --> 00:27:34,879
Is that why you kicked your
mother out so cruelly?

506
00:27:36,009 --> 00:27:37,009
That's right.

507
00:27:37,509 --> 00:27:39,919
I can never forgive my mom.

508
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:43,389
Once I found out that she was
Yuh Ri's mom, she made me sick.

509
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:47,159
I had a hard enough time
holding it in until now.

510
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:50,489
Don't tell me...

511
00:27:51,229 --> 00:27:53,459
you plan to tell Yuh Ri or my mom, do you?

512
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:56,369
Tell me. Whose side are you on?

513
00:27:57,529 --> 00:27:58,539
I told you.

514
00:27:59,169 --> 00:28:00,739
I'm always on your side.

515
00:28:02,439 --> 00:28:03,469
Good.

516
00:28:04,009 --> 00:28:06,539
The two of them must never find out. Ever.

517
00:28:07,609 --> 00:28:09,678
If you and I keep our mouths shut...

518
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:10,679
Mr. Joo Ho.

519
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:12,479
He knows too.

520
00:28:12,579 --> 00:28:14,225
What if he gets his memory back?

521
00:28:14,249 --> 00:28:16,349
I have to do whatever it
takes to silence him.

522
00:28:16,589 --> 00:28:17,889
Whatever it takes.

523
00:28:18,919 --> 00:28:21,129
I'll make my mom and Yuh
Ri, who killed Ga Ya,

524
00:28:21,689 --> 00:28:23,359
pay for their sins.

525
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:27,159
The mother and child...

526
00:28:27,529 --> 00:28:29,169
will end up killing each other.

527
00:28:29,899 --> 00:28:31,339
I'll make sure of it.

528
00:28:34,139 --> 00:28:36,269
These are the sales figures of Team A,

529
00:28:36,469 --> 00:28:38,379
and the contracts with buyers abroad.

530
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:39,939
As you can see,

531
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:42,879
Wid Fashion's stock price
has gone up thanks to that.

532
00:28:43,309 --> 00:28:44,719
I've seen the report.

533
00:28:45,749 --> 00:28:48,265
Father. Don't you think it's time...

534
00:28:48,289 --> 00:28:50,389
to name Hae Joo your successor?

535
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:53,519
Hae Joo. Are you confident?

536
00:28:54,219 --> 00:28:55,359
Naturally.

537
00:28:55,529 --> 00:28:58,659
I know I can grow Wid Group
much better than Uncle can.

538
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,369
Mr. Kim. Call in Koo Do Chi...

539
00:29:04,569 --> 00:29:06,169
and Son Yuh Ri...

540
00:29:06,339 --> 00:29:07,469
to my office right now.

541
00:29:13,179 --> 00:29:14,749
Shut it! Get over here!

542
00:29:15,249 --> 00:29:17,819
You'll pull my ear off, Mom.

543
00:29:18,719 --> 00:29:22,319
How could you stab Yuh Ri
in the back of all people?

544
00:29:22,619 --> 00:29:26,319
If you want to stab someone in
the back so badly, do it to me.

545
00:29:26,459 --> 00:29:27,758
I had no choice.

546
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:30,659
Hae Joo said she'd divorce Moo
Yul if I didn't help her.

547
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:34,259
They had nothing keeping them
together after Ga Ya died.

548
00:29:34,499 --> 00:29:36,769
I couldn't let him get kicked out.

549
00:29:37,129 --> 00:29:38,669
Still, how could you be a mole?

550
00:29:38,999 --> 00:29:40,469
Were you happy doing that?

551
00:29:41,239 --> 00:29:43,409
You can't hide from Yuh Ri forever.

552
00:29:44,269 --> 00:29:46,909
That's right. Confess and
ask for forgiveness.

553
00:29:47,339 --> 00:29:49,909
She wouldn't kill you.

554
00:29:50,449 --> 00:29:52,148
Kill me? No.

555
00:29:52,149 --> 00:29:54,319
I don't want to die. I'm not even married.

556
00:29:54,819 --> 00:29:56,149
I'd rather run away again.

557
00:29:57,319 --> 00:29:58,359
- Yul Mae.
- Yul Mae.

558
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:00,189
Yuh Ri.

559
00:30:00,859 --> 00:30:02,889
Yul Mae. It isn't true, right?

560
00:30:03,159 --> 00:30:05,199
You didn't do something
that frightening, right?

561
00:30:06,499 --> 00:30:07,499
Yuh Ri.

562
00:30:08,129 --> 00:30:09,528
I'm sorry.

563
00:30:09,529 --> 00:30:11,769
Please forgive me.

564
00:30:11,899 --> 00:30:15,469
Hae Joo threatened to divorce
Moo Yul if I didn't do it.

565
00:30:22,049 --> 00:30:23,079
Hello?

566
00:30:24,179 --> 00:30:25,249
The chairman? Now?

567
00:30:25,719 --> 00:30:26,978
Last year,

568
00:30:26,979 --> 00:30:29,395
Choi Mee Hee was engaged to the
French Ambassador in the US,

569
00:30:29,419 --> 00:30:30,849
and recently called it off.

570
00:30:31,689 --> 00:30:34,665
People close to her said she
took a trip for five weeks...

571
00:30:34,689 --> 00:30:36,209
to recover from the broken engagement.

572
00:30:37,059 --> 00:30:39,099
She came to Korea after
the broken engagement?

573
00:30:40,099 --> 00:30:42,169
- Okay. You may go now.
- Yes, ma'am.

574
00:30:46,439 --> 00:30:47,639
Come in, Joo Ho.

575
00:30:51,009 --> 00:30:52,039
What's wrong?

576
00:30:52,609 --> 00:30:54,909
Did you remember something?

577
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:00,779
I need to confirm something...

578
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:02,689
about your missing child.

579
00:31:02,949 --> 00:31:04,819
You do? What is it?

580
00:31:08,889 --> 00:31:09,929
Sit down.

581
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:16,299
Koo Hae Joo's new product is
making groundbreaking sales.

582
00:31:16,669 --> 00:31:18,599
Thanks to that, Wid Fashion's stock...

583
00:31:19,139 --> 00:31:21,309
that had hit bottom, are halfway back up.

584
00:31:21,639 --> 00:31:23,569
The company's image is being restored too.

585
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:26,509
Congrats, Ms. Koo.

586
00:31:26,979 --> 00:31:28,079
Congratulations.

587
00:31:28,209 --> 00:31:30,179
I don't need your lip service.

588
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:34,218
It's true that there were
some shameful things,

589
00:31:34,219 --> 00:31:35,649
but a competition is a competition.

590
00:31:35,749 --> 00:31:36,919
The results are what matters.

591
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:39,159
The winner of this mission...

592
00:31:39,789 --> 00:31:40,959
is Hae Joo.

593
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:48,599
The two of you promised...

594
00:31:48,699 --> 00:31:50,299
to accept whatever the result may be.

595
00:31:51,099 --> 00:31:53,239
Hae Joo is the successor now.

596
00:31:55,639 --> 00:31:57,039
Please give me another chance.

597
00:31:57,269 --> 00:31:58,839
This wasn't a fair competition.

598
00:31:59,939 --> 00:32:02,109
We may have been partly at
fault for the design leak,

599
00:32:02,249 --> 00:32:03,979
but Ji Won cheated.

600
00:32:05,479 --> 00:32:07,989
And behind Ji Won...

601
00:32:08,449 --> 00:32:10,019
was Hae Joo.

602
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:12,319
What do you mean?

603
00:32:12,919 --> 00:32:15,289
Uncle. Don't make things up.

604
00:32:16,129 --> 00:32:18,959
Mom worked alone on leaking your design.

605
00:32:19,199 --> 00:32:20,859
- I wasn't involved.
- That isn't true.

606
00:32:21,729 --> 00:32:24,469
The designer Angela Choi,
who worked with us,

607
00:32:24,939 --> 00:32:26,699
was Ms. Koo Hae Joo's birth mother.

608
00:32:27,169 --> 00:32:30,309
Yesterday, we witnessed
their secret meeting.

609
00:32:30,969 --> 00:32:33,538
Ms. Koo is the one who pressured
Angela Choi to press charges...

610
00:32:33,539 --> 00:32:34,709
against us.

611
00:32:35,609 --> 00:32:37,079
To kick Do Chi out...

612
00:32:37,349 --> 00:32:38,718
and become the successor.

613
00:32:38,719 --> 00:32:39,719
Don't try to frame me.

614
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:42,595
Angela Choi is a professional.

615
00:32:42,619 --> 00:32:45,289
She pressed charges
because she was outraged.

616
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:46,689
I didn't pressure her!

617
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:48,659
If you don't believe us,

618
00:32:48,929 --> 00:32:50,429
we'll prove it.

619
00:32:51,129 --> 00:32:52,459
Prove? Whatever.

620
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:56,829
How could you prove that I was
involved with the design leak?

621
00:32:57,169 --> 00:32:58,839
Yul Mae. Come in.

622
00:33:09,109 --> 00:33:10,109
Yul Mae.

623
00:33:14,049 --> 00:33:16,389
What is it? What's your question?

624
00:33:17,049 --> 00:33:18,589
Did that child...

625
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:22,089
have a unique mark or anything on her body?

626
00:33:23,089 --> 00:33:24,259
Like a birthmark...

627
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:25,959
- or...
- A scar.

628
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:27,969
She had a burn scar.

629
00:33:28,829 --> 00:33:31,399
A burn... A burn scar?

630
00:33:32,639 --> 00:33:35,709
She should have a clear burn
scar on her right shoulder.

631
00:33:35,969 --> 00:33:38,409
I spilled water on her by
mistake while making formula,

632
00:33:38,709 --> 00:33:40,639
and gave her a scar.

633
00:33:42,179 --> 00:33:44,109
Then Yuh Ri...

634
00:33:46,719 --> 00:33:47,749
What's wrong?

635
00:33:48,219 --> 00:33:50,419
Joo Ho. Did you recall something?

636
00:33:51,059 --> 00:33:53,819
Do you remember something
about my daughter?
