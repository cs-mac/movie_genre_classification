00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,510
 Hello?

12
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,951
 Good morning, is your mother in?


14
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,510

15
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,235
 Are your ready?

16
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,712
I need to go now.


19
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,353
Jesus, the son of God...

20
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:11,155
...descended to earth and suffered...

21
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,829
...to pay for our sins.


29
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,039
*You're in danger.

30
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,118
*I don't care
as long as I'm near you.

31
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,078
*I never thanked you for your help.

32
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,396
*It was brave, very courageous.

33
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,830
*I've never seen you so beautiful.

34
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,634
*I think I'm in love with you.

35
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,793
*You'll come with me to the police ?
* No.

36
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,035
*Why?

37
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,629
*I killed Charles Ringan.

38
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,831
*Would you tell the Commissioner?

39
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,438
*Yes, if you ask it.

40
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,993
*I don't want to.

41
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,556
*Listen, I'm very tired, I feel stiff.

42
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,038
*I killed a man and I witnessed
the murder of a poor soul.

43
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,630
*It's all because Geiger sang Carmen.

44
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,595
*If I told, your house would
be invaded by police...

45
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,394
*...before you'd have time to flee.


54
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,751
*Perhaps she'll recover.
I've seen it in the past.

55
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,635
*We'll let your father know about Ringan.

56
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,673
*You forgot something.

57
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,789
*Me?

58
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,596
*What do you have?

59
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,630
*Nothing you can't heal.

64
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,076
OH!


00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,673
"The Slide Whistle Micmacs"

68
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,674
 If I extract the bullet,
he'll be a vegetable.

69
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,475
If I don't extract it,
he'll be living on a knife edge.

70
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,399
 Better to be alive and at risk of dying...

71
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,274
...then to be dead.

72
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,074
 This is closer to philosophy then medicine.

73
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,157
Heads or Tails?

74
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,156
 Heads!

75
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,228
 OK, I'll leave it.
It'll ring the alarms at airports!


79
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,798
 They changed the lock.

80
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,311
 What happened,
did you comb your hair with a tinopener?


81
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,113
 Where's my stuff?

82
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,436
 Initially, in the cellar.
But you know people...

83
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,872
 After 3 days, there was
little more than odd socks.


86
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,309
 That's my hat

87
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,756
Hey...

90
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,114
 My little Bazil...

91
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,516
For you, fell off the back of a truck.

92
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,119
100% cotton.

93
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,759
 You've a job, you'll find accommodation.

95
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,156
 Good morning.
Is Serge in?

96
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,273
 Well! If it isn't Bazil!
You've come back!

97
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,834
 I almost didn't.

98
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,873
 I hope they took the lead
from your head.

99
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,355
 I'm back, faithful to the position.

100
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,200
 But the position was not faithful to you.

101
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,595
I had to replace you.

102
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,992
This is Lola.

103
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,713
Three month trial.

104
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,833
 We just signed a permanent contract .
 Ah...

105
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,759
 Well, we haven't kissed...

106
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,148
 Mister Bazil!

107
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,954
 Don't listen to him.
In fact, I have a boyfriend.

108
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,639
 His name's Ricardo.

109
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,629
 He picks me up every night on his motorbike.

110
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,194
 He always parks there.

111
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,791
 Where you were shot.

112
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,399
 One day, while riding...

113
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,751
 We heard a little noise,
like a pebble stuck in the tire.

114
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,277
Mr Bazil, it was no pebble.

115
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,149
Which hand?

116
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,673
Make an effort.

117
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,954
*She puts her head under her feet
and her toes in her nose

118
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,232
*And then does the splits*

119
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,751
*She spins and
coils like a caterpillar*

120
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,679
*Suddenly, her legs around his neck*

121
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:25,397
*She spins, like ball
And nibbles his knees*

122
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,672
*The rubber woman*

123
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,997
* With her, what fun they can have
Ah, it's crazy*

124
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,352
*It's enough
to make you go funny in the head*

125
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,155
*They search below
And they find it underneath*

126
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,518
*The rubber woman*

127
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,475
 Thank you...

138
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,108
 Have you five minutes?

139
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,831
I spent my life in jail.

140
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,758
So they call me "Closet".

141
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,429
 I'm Bazil.

142
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,517
 I know.
You're a sweet in jar.

143
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,277
You've been on the streets for 2 months,

144
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,358
but you've not submerged, you have a purpose.
What is it?

145
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,394
 I live day to day.

146
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,717
With the bullet,
that can make me trip out anytime.

147
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,198
 Me, the widow maker gave me
this injury.

148
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,710
The guillotine in 59.

149
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,595
The guillotine jammed.

150
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,836
It happened 2 times.
I was pardoned.

151
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,951
Get that bullet out of your head.

152
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,599
 Impossible.
The surgeon said...

153
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,835
Because...

154
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,672
 You follow me.
A family will adopt you.


156
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,356
 Hi.

157
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,789
 Hi!

158
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,311
 That's Max.
Here we're home.

159
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,878
We share our home.
This is our little goose of the Capitol.

160
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,991
If the robber is pointing...

161
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,875
Whistle blasts

162
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,390
Ha! Ha!
Go, go, my little guy.

165
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,637
Come in, don't be shy.


167
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,915
 Wakey...

168
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,474
 Come, let me introduce...

169
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,392
For recruitment,
it's she who decides.

170
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,513
 You collect stray bullets?
 Yes, ma'am.

171
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,835
 Say!

172
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,793
 I'm Tambouille.

173
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,117
 Here stuff is recovered,
we sort and repair it.

174
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,072
 Everybody together.

175
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,759
Even little Pierre.

176
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:30,192
And he's an artist.

178
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,797
 He brings anything we can use.

187
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,869
 59...

188
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,354
42...

189
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,228
104!

190
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,989
 Nickel.

191
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,511
 She's called "Calculator".
Father and motherland unknown.


192
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,950
 He has a compass in his eye.

193
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,959
 The white man
a compass in the eye

194
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,198
...starvation,
begins at the top...

195
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,471
...and goes from cock to the ass.
Yes!

196
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,557
"The compass in the eye".
Note.

197
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,229
 He was a writer in Brazil.

198
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,397
 Fracasso is my name.

199
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,033
I have carbon staples...

200
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,639
...in my throat.

201
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,595
 He lost a lung in a
water bottle explosion

202
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,270
...and also have a cycle Dynamo
in my stomach

203
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,755
...and 3 neck joints
of titanium.

204
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,669
Well, go ahead, tap away.
Go ahead, it's titanium!

205
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,836
Go!
Go ahead!

206
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,556
 Oh!

207
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,354
 He dreams of getting his name
in the Guinness Book of Records.

208
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,115
I already did. in 77!
212 meters: Record for the human-cannonball.

209
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,356
 We never saw
the certificate.

210
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,631
 I was robbed!
I've told you already.


212
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,355
 Hey, you!
Why do you get him upset?


214
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,959
Now that you belong to the
Family...

215
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,552
...get me a small pot of cream
from the fridge.


217
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,833
Further down, boy!

218
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,231
 Aaaahh!

221
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,429
 You want a picture?

222
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,631
 She's a little snappish...

223
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,674
...but she's always the first
to bend for others...

224
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,316
 You're a contortionist?
 No, I am the vegetable crisper!

225
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,079
 She was like that from birth...

226
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,872
At 5, she was already hiding
in the pantry.

227
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,469
 And he remained so long
in the closet...

228
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:28,355
...without laces in his shoes
that he's forgot how to tie them!

230
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:31,910
 Come!

231
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,589
Go to the table, the mash is ready.


234
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,872
*Speaking a Flemish dialect*

238
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,432
 Can I help you?

239
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,632
 Yes, I would like to see Mr. De Fenouillet.

240
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,592
 Of course,
you have an appointment?

241
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,440
 That is to say,
I have something in mind.

242
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,869
It concerns him.

243
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:34,470
 If this is a project or idea,
send an email.

244
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,912
 I could send him a scan,
but I prefer to see him.

245
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,792
 You'll have to leave.

246
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:41,990
 Yes. Warning!

247
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:42,996
Warning!

248
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,316
Warning! Warning!


250
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:55,996
 Boo!

251
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,953
 Show this clown to the street, that's all.

252
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,552
A bullet in the head?

253
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,070
At least he'll remember us!

256
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,675
 Guys, I need someone here!
Go!

257
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,194
*You know we're leaders...

258
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,159
*...in the field of cluster munitions.

259
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,716
*We have quadrupled our sales
in the Gulf countries...

260
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,836
*...decreased by 7 to 9% on collateral damage.

261
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,712
*As you know, we're not monsters.

262
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,150
*We don't want anyone's death.

263
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,953
*We all know well...

264
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,630
*...a wounded soldier is more expensive
than a dead soldier!

265
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:18,471
*Our CBS87 disperses
202 projectiles...

266
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,638
*...and cleans the equivalent
of 4 football fields.

267
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,957
*We have been present in the Gulf, Kosovo...

268
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,992
*...in Afghanistan...
In short, it's time to call...

269
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,431
*...to this forum
the architect of our success.

270
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,393
*Our CEO:
François Marconi!


272
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,749
*Thank you, Thank you.
Thank you very much.

273
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,837
*Tracers...

274
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,993
*...explosives or bullets...

275
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,350
*...ours are the best...

276
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,995
*...the most aggressive and successful.


278
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,951
*Rimbaud started as a poet
finally as an arms dealer.

279
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,674
*Well, I...
I'll do the opposite.

280
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,076
*But until retirement...

281
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,115
*...I will continue to rhyme
ambition with ammunition...

282
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,470
*...Living with dynamite.

283
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,752
*Long live Vigilante Armament!


288
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,032
Goodnight, Mr. President.

289
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,638
General...

290
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,797
Joseph, good night!

295
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,793
 I remind you...

296
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,718
...of the new rule in force.

297
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,515
A landmine was placed under the playing surface.

298
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,030
 Yes, it is a renewed challenge...

299
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,719
...offered by the league.


301
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,189
 The suspense was short lived
 as the frontcenter...

302
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,995
...the visiting team
just payed the price.

305
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:57,351
 You were brilliant tonight.
 Thank you, Georges.

306
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,512
 Arthur Rimbaud was an arms dealer, in history?

307
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:05,509
 Yes, but it didn't prevented him dying
of gangrene, when they amputated his leg.

308
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,272
 Baudelaire, of syphilis?

309
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,754
 Verlaine, delirium tremens...

310
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,837
...Lorca was shot...

311
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,031
...Nerval hanged himself from a lamppost.

312
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:18,835
 I will never encourage my son to
become a poet, sir.

316
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,873
 Tomorrow,
wake me up at 10am

317
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,235
 Yes, sir.

319
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,360
 You've worked for us long?

320
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,709
 30 years next month.

321
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,235
 Ah...

322
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,069
 Why don't we...

323
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,432
...upgrade this place for your 30 years?

324
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,950
With some hightech equipment.

325
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,710
 The old pots make the best soups.

326
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,469
 Hum...

327
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,275
Change is coming.

328
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,796
At least once every 30 years.


335
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,950
 Why can't he sleep at the foot of the bed?

336
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,593
 Stop moaning!

337
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,518
 Birds of a Feather.

338
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,756
*Hey, Grandma?
*Croutons!

341
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,712
 The day went well?

342
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,309
 Yes, papa!
 I was brilliant tonight.

343
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,229
My Speech was fantastic,
I was compared to Rimbaud.

344
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,589
You know who he is?

345
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,359
 Yes, but your not that muscular.

346
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,269
 No, not "Rambo", darling, "Rimbaud".

347
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,632
 Put him to bed.

348
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,955
 Yes, Sir.

356
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,996
*Hello, Yes.

357
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:29,397
*No, wait...
How did you get this number?

358
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,749
Yes, I see.

359
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:34,715
No, not this kind of transaction,
not over the phone.

360
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,911
No! No more...

361
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,872
I prefer a public place.

362
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,912
I know...Say Wednesday...

363
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,634
*...3pm, the sports department
of Galeries Lafayette.

364
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,309
Yes, that's it.

365
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,310
 Waffles...

366
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,476
...d'Brussels!

368
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,672
Don't eat too much, I put rum in the batter.

369
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,154
 Hey, stop!

370
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,512
*Speaking in Flemish dialect*

373
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,159
*She speaks Chinese*


375
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,597
 Hurry, the minots!
They'll be ready soon!

376
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,233
 Mr Fracasse...

377
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,753
Isn't this you, here in the
Guinness Book of Records?

378
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,268
 Yikes!

379
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,913
The 77!

380
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,272
What did I tell you!

381
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,472
What did I tell you...
Ha! Ha!

382
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:47,158
"On July 14, 1977,
Theodore Henri de Montreuil"...

383
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,317
Who is Theodore Henry?

384
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,478
..."beat by 9 meters...

385
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,833
..."the record for human-canonball
established by Mr. Grampee in 66"! Ha!

386
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:59,795
"Beat by 9 meters"!

389
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,276
Yes!

391
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,638
You'll give it me, kid?
 Oh no.

392
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,353
 Ah yes, please, you give me.

393
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,995
 But no...
 If you give me....

394
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,271
 You sign my T-shirt, then.

395
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,555
 "T. Henri"...

396
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,239
Thierry Henri.

397
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,750
Fracasso, I have a job for you.

398
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,917
 I'm not joking...

399
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,589
...but I think
there's a catch.

400
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,075
 You've an idea in mind?

401
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,594
 Mister poses a mystery.

402
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,513
Well, who cares, you're not curious.

405
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,838
 Oh...Oh!

407
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,475
 What time?

408
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:04,196
 Tomorrow, 10am,
opposite the tomb of Sacha Guitry.

410
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,275
 Mister Marconi?

411
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,630
I am the messenger
of Omar Boulounga.

412
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,749
 Omar Boulounga...
The former dictator...?

413
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,919
 The former and the next.
He's preparing a revolution.

414
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,439
 I don't have a polical view.

415
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:45,269
 We require rifles, grenades and mines.

416
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:48,996
 And the DGA, the Export Committee,
the Ottawa Treaty?

417
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,157
 You have the weapons.
In stock.

418
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,193
You don't have an export sector in Zamibia.

419
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,232
We'd like one.

420
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,796
And this should interest me?
 Check us out.

421
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:04,949
We'll give you double the cash and more...
in diamonds if the coup succeeds.

422
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,150
 Continue.

423
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,237
 Mr. Bouloungas' national account...

424
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,953
...the diamond mines...

425
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,198
Don't Sneeze!
 Think of something, fast!

426
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:17,314
Zebras are white with black stripes
or black with white stripes?

427
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,669
Oh, pygmies!

428
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,713
Are there dwarfs among pygmies?

429
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,911
Why do we say "CIA" and not "ifeow"?

430
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,714
Or "fbiouch" and not "FBl?

431
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:27,989
 Think...

432
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:31,192
...but do not delay too much,
we returned to Conakry Monday.

438
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,276
 You!

439
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,909
Yes, You!

440
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,316
I don't know what your shenanigans
are about...

441
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,910
...but either you go and continue
doing everything alone...

442
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,953
...or stay and ask us for help.

443
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,832
Am I clear?

444
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,997
 Some of them want to help me?

445
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,269
 What?

446
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:19,439
 I found the manufacturer of the bullet
that killed my father.

447
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:23,838
I need to do two things at once
- I can't do it alone.

448
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,672
 Stick together...

449
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,197
 They're the watchmen.

450
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,994
Inside is the dealer.

451
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:46,073
The drug's hidden in the mailbox.

452
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,555
That way, if they're ever searched...

453
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,149
...they are white as snow. Let's go!

454
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:05,871
You've already done it for the crash
and whiplash at the same time?

455
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,354
 You're old school.

456
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,436
 Yes?

457
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:16,553
 Asbestos Control. A problem was reported.

458
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,956
 But there's no asbestos here!

459
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,918
 We didn't find asbestos in
the devil vauvert.

460
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,189
From the crack of dawn...

461
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,755
...we dealt with that problem.

462
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,554
So, no need to rock the boat.

463
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,875
 Ah!

464
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,873
 Oh! But...

465
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,230
 The widow told me she'd
never leave.

466
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,671
Wherever I go, it's on my back.

467
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,949
 Hats off!

468
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,469
 And my receipt?

469
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,830
 The more one drinks, the more one is right!


473
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,634
 The boarding hall, please?

474
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:34,431
 My brother, you want a magical necklace?
Get you into heaven.

475
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,792
This powder wards off evil spirits.

476
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,433
But yes! Ha! Ha!

477
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,029
Ah, you're the boss? Commander!

480
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:49,875
 Here!

481
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,912
 It will protect you against the devil...

482
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,315
...and the vagaries of fate.

483
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,478
Incense that'll allow you to contact
 the deceased.

484
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:00,912
 Let the passengers be!
I've told you a 100 times!

485
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,077
This is your last warning. Get away!

486
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:07,433
Sorry, gentlemen.
Wishing you a safe journey.

487
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,076
 Excuse me, please
sir.

488
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,236
 Hello.

489
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,078
 We're seeking the plane to America.

490
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,839
 The departure hall?

491
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,190
 Yes, we go to Manhattan to visit...

492
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,435
...my son.

493
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,830
 You must register your baggage before.

494
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,394
 It's half-sister...

495
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,478
...my son who left in 1989 for New York.

496
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,431
 New York...
You're talking to me?

497
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,314
 In 1988.

498
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,794
On December 12, 1988.


505
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,716
*Last call for Conakry*

506
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,956
*Lufthansa Flight 202*

507
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,916
 The vertebra of Tino Rossi.

508
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,389
Winston Churchills
Fingernail clippings.

509
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,112
The molar of Marilyn...

510
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,668
Monroe.

511
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,749
The foot of Salma Lazarus...

512
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,553
Heart of Louis XVI.

513
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,432
The finger of Matisse.

514
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,196
The eye of Mussolini...

516
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:07,392
It is expected that the DGA launched the study
and called the Saudis...

517
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,389
Yes, it was an individual effort more
than group...rather well done.

518
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,473
Well, they will not provide the
source code.

519
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:19,989
If it works?
Remember the Sarajevo market...

520
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,910
Collateral damage added value
in the media.

521
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,559
But of course...

522
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,350
That's why it kills me to say.

523
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,952
You and me, we work...

524
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,036
...in the defense industry...

525
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,197
...not in the attack industry.

526
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,596
I beg you, dear friend.

527
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:10,030
You are always welcome.

528
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,034
My respects to madame.

532
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:05,475
I'm already 10 minutes late,
hurry!

534
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,555
What was that, Maurice?

535
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,637
 "Etienne", sir.
 Etienne, yes!

536
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:16,037
 We have a puncture, I think.
Sorry, I'll see.

537
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,355
 Peasant!

540
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:41,875
 Hello.

541
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,277
I have a reservation
in the name of De Fenouillet.

542
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,596
 Yes.
You are expected.

543
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,355
 I am the right hand of
Mr. De Fenouillet.

544
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:59,394
He asked me to tell you that the
eye of Mussolini interests him

545
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:03,992
In exchange for Achilles heel and
Adam's apple of...

546
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:11,992
1, 2, 3...test.
1, 2, 3...test.

547
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:15,113
I am the messenger of Omar Boulounga.

548
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,556
 Go ahead, make me an offer.

549
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:35,991
 Do not put the cart
before the horse. It will save us...

550
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,589
...from having 2 feet
in the same hoof.

551
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,911
 If you have the eye of Mussolini...

552
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:45,192
...I'll give you the molar of Marilyn.

553
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:46,390
It's worth it.

554
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:49,389
I've got the finger of Matisse
and fingernails Churchill...

555
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,353
...name the price.
What say you, Mr. Lazarus?

556
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,434
 Mr. Lazarus has had a setback,
he had to leave.

557
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:00,393
Unfortunately,
Mr. Lazarus had to stand you up.

558
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,398
He's returned to his household.

559
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:03,955
 Who are you?

560
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,751
 I am the messenger of Omar Boulounga.

561
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,189
 Boulounga?

562
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:14,190
I thought...
 We were done?

563
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,310
Nay.

564
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,792
 A popular revolution...

565
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,711
 A popular revolution...

566
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,434
...Omar will return where
Omar belongs.

567
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,158
 I'm not interested in politics.

568
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:27,873
 It doesn't feed you bread...

569
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:33,759
Double the cash...

570
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,359
...plus more diamonds...

571
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:36,595
...if the usurper...

572
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,714
...takes to his heels
and we get back Boulounga.

573
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,033
 When, how and where?

574
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:48,153
 Tuesday, 27th, one of your men.
Just one...

575
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:51,910
...will be at the station at 14.45 with the samples.

576
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:55,397
He'll buy a ticket for Crecy-la-Chapelle and leave...

577
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:56,749
...with a deposit....

578
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,075
...of 30% Cash...

579
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:00,555
...dollars and cents.

581
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:06,313
 Well?
 The operator's transferring me.

582
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,353
Marconi?
Omar Boulounga in person.

583
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:12,154
So you thought?
Ha! Ha!

584
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,829
Congratulations, you're now looking at noon to 2pm.

585
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:17,509
I didn't invent sliced bread...

586
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:20,553
...but I don't mistake candles
for lanterns.

587
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:23,115
Well, I want one man
present...

588
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:26,472
...with samples at the
Gare de l'Est tomorrow at 14.45.

589
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:30,070
He'll get a ticket
for La Ferte-Milon.

590
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:33,750
He'll leave with the 1st
installment of the order. ok?

591
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,155
Right. Ok!

594
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,711
 Ready for more, guys?

595
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,029
 Why "guys"?

596
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:50,069
 Well, because there'll be action.

597
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:53,238
 Ah! When there's action, it's not for girls?

598
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:56,436
 Preconception...

599
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,153
Uh...

600
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:01,559
You're not a real...

601
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,435
 Real what?

602
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,795
A real girl! Is that it?

603
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:09,274
 I wouldn't say that.

604
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:10,515
 If that's it.

605
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,394
 No.
 Is it! Is that what you wanted to say.

606
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:14,317
 No.

607
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:18,798
 Did you mean I'm a 'Tomboy'?

608
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:20,479
That's right.

609
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:24,594
When I have to fold into a bag,
I'm in the club!

612
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:50,878
*Ladies and gentlemen,
arms traffickers...*

613
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,913
*...currently waiting in the station.*

614
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,713
*Be vigilant.*

615
00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:00,229
*Don't buy a land mine from
a dealer on the run.*

616
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:03,990
*You risk him using it.*

617
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:06,672
*Thank you for your attention.

618
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,351
 Wow! What's that?

619
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,791
 1 kg 720 steel,
350 grams of polycarbonate...

620
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:43,672
...70 grammes of kevlar.

621
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,270
 And that's not a small Uzi is it?

622
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:52,279
 It is a MAC 10, maybe even 11.

623
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,073
 No, no!

624
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:57,195
You step on it, it'll off your foot!

625
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:58,071
 Oh...

626
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,313
 Or your life, perhaps.

627
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,228
 Hold there!

628
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,795
That's for recycling!
It's not for us.

629
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:16,913
 I didn't recycle it,
it fell off the back of a tank!

630
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,315
 Confiscated!

631
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:20,558
Thurs tomorrow, play naughty!

632
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:23,400
Or is Scarface and his return to Chicago!

633
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:24,510
If I wasn't here...

634
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:28,110
 Ready for Phase 2?
 Strike while the iron is hot!

635
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,630
Let's draw!

636
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:33,391
De Fenouillet, here's Boulounga.

637
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,830
Your man didn't turn up!

638
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:39,635
The deal is obsolete.
Vigilante Armament offered me better.

639
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:44,118
Make a cross on diamonds and
butter in the spinach.

643
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,798
Marconi Boulounga for Omar.

644
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:14,310
 If you could do it a bit more sober.

645
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,670
 Marconi? Boulounga is pissed!

646
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:20,032
Your boy took to his heels.

647
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,833
The deal is dead and gone.

648
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:26,352
Aubervilliers Armaments are
better customers. Goodbye!

656
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,396
 Tambouille,
I have to go out between 1 and 2pm.

657
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:24,432
 Your 2 sharks have taken the bait?

658
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,760
 For now, they're biting.
I'm...

659
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,268
...just going to sweeten the pot!

660
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:33,313
But when it bites, it will be well hooked...

661
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,795
It's big.
 Then I...

662
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:39,595
Then 'We'...
We'll turn the screws.

663
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:42,350
No, not until we see their faces.

664
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,433
Not Gay, Gay.
Lookout!

665
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:49,994
Lookout.

666
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,158
Yes. Oh well...

667
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:56,069
I need volunteers to go on the roofs.
Thank you, calculator.

668
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:59,716
It's good to have people who count.

669
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,030
Good...

670
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,269
Uh...where are you going then?

671
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:12,039
 Well, wherever you go.

672
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,231
 Excuse me, but I must handle a delicate matter.

673
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:18,078
I prefer to go alone.

674
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,075
 Ah, I understand.

675
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:24,234
It's true that in matters of delicacy...

676
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:27,114
...and even subtlety...

677
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,590
...you're an expert.


680
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:50,793
 "The diva of porn",
she'll please you!

681
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:52,991
Something of a pencil sharpener!

682
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:57,355
 Great, but do you own a nightgown.

683
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:58,914
 I sleep naked.

684
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,428
 Hey, Henry...

685
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:02,429
...you spell Henri...

686
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,472
...not with a Y but with an I.

687
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:09,108
 Oh? Are you sure?

688
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,197
Thierry Henri?
 Yeah.

689
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:14,677
It would be wrong, Thierry Henry?

690
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:18,953
 Do not worry, I'm always game
for the Cyclops sneeze.

691
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:21,835
Well, we'll do as you ask?
 Yeah.

692
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:24,877
 Soon.
 This evening.

694
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:32,192
 What?

695
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:33,959
 I thought...

696
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:37,755
...you're fishing for shark,
not cod or herring!

697
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:41,029
 We're not married.

698
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,472
 No, we're not married.

699
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:48,199
Anyway,
perverts are not my thing.

700
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:51,840
Mine's like...
with contortionists.

701
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:55,237
My mother always told me
to distrust twisted...

702
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,279
 I am not twisted.

703
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:04,510
I am a sensitive soul
in a flexible body.

704
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,074
That's not the same

707
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,518
 Hello?
 Listen to me.

708
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:17,710
 You listen to me!

709
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,069
 Camel!

710
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:21,191
I despise your shenanigans!

711
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:23,869
Put the Boulounga diamonds
where you like!

712
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:28,199
Dickless! It appears that the teeth, fingers...

713
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:32,871
...the bones of the Assyrian kings,
the looting of the Baghdad museum...

714
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:35,754
If you want war,
think twice about it!

715
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:39,311
 When one is fortunate to have divorced...

716
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:42,114
*...to advantage, one doesn't choose as a mistress...

717
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:44,555
...the wife of the Prime Minister.

718
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:49,119
I also have the recording at home.

725
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,592
 Well, gotta say...

726
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:00,838
...that Grandpa and Grandma
did it in the dark...

727
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:04,430
 So doing it in front of everyone...

728
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:07,917
...is just a little more dramatic...

729
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:12,273
...a little more creative,
a little more flexible, right?


731
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:16,669
 Bazil! Hey!

732
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:17,870
 Boo!

734
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:22,276
Oh...

737
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:31,910
Let's go.

738
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:49,470
 And, I'm not too much girl to act the alley cat?

739
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:53,157
 No, precisely why we needed a person...

740
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:54,316
 Flexible!

741
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:59,637
 We needed someone like you,
feline and female.

747
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:03,875
 Oh dear...

759
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:45,919
 Marignan?
 1515.

760
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:47,872
 Nagasaki?
 17 kilotonnes.

761
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:49,036
 Kiss?

762
00:59:58,320 --> 00:59:59,435
 Hello, sir.

763
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:03,872
Something happened during the night.
It's most unusual.

766
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:11,673
Sir!

767
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:18,198
 Come on, Maurice.
 "Etienne", Sir.

768
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:38,399
 I have a delivery for
Mr. De Fenouillet

769
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:41,478
 You're out of luck,
he just left.

770
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:42,954
Leave it to me.

771
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:44,958
 It's a bit heavy.

772
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:45,956
 Ah...

773
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:49,715
Go ahead.

774
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:56,875
There.


777
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:36,279
 7 meters, 50 centimeters, 4 millimeters.

778
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:08,993
The same rubber

779
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:11,874
With her, you can go crazy

780
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:15,159
She'll send you funny in the head

781
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,317
It seeks the above

782
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:20,114
And is found below

783
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:25,031
The same rubber

787
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,597
 Pip squeak.

788
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:49,680
 You've washed your hands?
 YES!

789
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:51,789
 Let's see.

790
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:53,752
Hey, you!

792
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:57,638
There is no laughing at the table.

793
01:02:57,920 --> 01:02:59,319
She imitates.

794
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:02,190
Where are you,
with thy merchants of death?

795
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:06,155
 They're hooked! The more they struggle
the more their trapped.

796
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:08,749
 Oh...When I think of
those poor mothers...

797
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:11,554
...who lose their children
because of mines.

798
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:15,352
 You know Tambouille?

799
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:19,552
She had 2 little girls.
One evening at the Foire du Trone...

800
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:21,876
...she saw them enter
the labyrinth.

801
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:23,752
She never saw them come out.

802
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:27,396
For years, she has searched
the streets.

803
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:29,671
Eventually, she became a tramp.

804
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:32,918
And after all that,
She adopted us.

805
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:34,235
 Fifififi...

806
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:36,636
Enough, my lowly masses.

807
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:39,391
What can you see my
little salty?

808
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:42,194
 Fats: 62%, proteins: 4%...
 OH!

809
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:43,316
 Ben who?

810
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:46,114
 A little salty is as it should be...

811
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:48,954
...a black belt
at Cordon Bleu.

812
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:50,673
 Oh, surely not...

813
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:52,916
Even if...oh no.

814
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:55,839
You've got an idea for cooking
your 2 big fish?

815
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:58,998
 Frying.
There's more to roll in flour.


817
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:01,835
 In the flour!

824
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:40,914
 Fracasso, no doubts?
 No! He has no doubts.


826
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:49,755
Go! We will balance the Fracasse!

827
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:51,709
It blows.

829
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:01,675
Calculator!

830
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:03,313
 Distance: 138 meters.

831
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:06,114
Wind Speed: 12 km/h,
Direction South/SouthWest.

832
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:07,839
There.
 Weight of the projectile?

833
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:09,439
 76 kilos.

834
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:12,280
 Add 4.
 It's Tambouilles fault.

835
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:13,913
 OK...say 80.

836
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:15,553
Why did you add more?

837
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:19,150
 Slice: 70 grammes.
Butter: 37 g. Jam...

838
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:21,431
 Okay, okay!
Come on, get ready.

840
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:31,714
 Remington!

841
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:34,437
For the committees approval!

842
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:36,670
*Engine!


844
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:44,114
 It's time to go.

845
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:47,153
 No, it's too early. 59...

847
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:50,473
58...

848
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:52,079
...
57...

849
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:54,070
56...

851
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:57,392
 55 secondes.

852
01:05:57,680 --> 01:05:58,635
 Oh!

855
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:09,274
 Closet, well then?

856
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:13,712
 What? It's recycled!
It's old...

857
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:14,830
Oh!

862
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:28,635
 Closet!

863
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:31,431
You Bastard!

864
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:33,873
 But it's recycled!

875
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:27,036
Fire!

891
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:42,715
 Watchout!

894
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:50,229
Come on, move!

897
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:56,036
Watchout!!

898
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:23,996
 No batteries?!
How?!

899
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:26,191
 It's recycled.
 It's recycled?!

900
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:29,711
I broke the altitude record!
And I had proof!

901
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,069
 One Minute, butterfly!

902
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:32,156
 What?!

903
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:36,718
 I devoted myself to the the filming!
That's the last straw!

904
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,638
No Battery!

906
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:42,638
 It's an unwritten law:
One key to the equipment.

907
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:46,629
It's going to explode.

908
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:49,878
 It's her.
 Code 5, no quarter.

909
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:57,473
 You are Madame Cisse?
 Yes.

910
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:59,239
 Your husband has a problem.

911
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:01,791
 What happened?

912
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:05,831
 Your husband is ashamed:
He lost your residency permit.

913
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:08,238
 Then I only have to request a duplicate.

914
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:11,751
 That's what I did with Edward Mangin...

915
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:13,917
...to my friend the Prefect of Police.

916
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:15,838
But your record as not been found.

917
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:18,556
 But I assure you...

918
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:20,114
Hmmmm?

919
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:22,356
Who are you?

920
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:26,398
I'm part of the company that
employs your husband.

921
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:29,035
You see, our activities relate to...

922
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:30,799
...national defense.

923
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:32,433
At the same time, obviously...

924
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:35,314
...we feel obliged to protect children...

925
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:39,434
I always try to put pressure on my friend Mangin

926
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:41,790
That's good,
I'm seeing him tomorrow night.

927
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:43,957
I know, you know what?

928
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:47,589
Show him.

929
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:51,190
 In all Arsenals, they have the same machine.

930
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:52,993
You see where she is?

931
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:55,316
It's essential, it must be installed with...

932
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:58,114
...bulkhead opening on the outside...

933
01:10:58,360 --> 01:10:59,395
...like that.

934
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:02,797
This has been done to guide the air out...

935
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:04,513
...in case of...

936
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:09,032
...technician activainge the machine
behind the door...

937
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:11,276
Ideally we would proceed...

938
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:14,757
...during lunch, when the machine is paused.

939
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:16,837
 What should I do?
 Almost nothing.

940
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:21,238
You unscrew the small tube here,
you slide the steel ball out...

941
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:23,636
...and that's all.

942
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:26,479
 It's dangerous?

943
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:28,955
 Returning to Somalia...
is dangerous too.

944
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:31,556
 I put it where?
Ah!

945
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:36,116
Do not bother to clean the
dust underneath.

950
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:09,751
 You have a moment?

951
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:15,713
 It's forbidden to park here
with this load.

952
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,070
 Don't worry, I'll be quick.

955
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:11,078
 By God!

958
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:37,714
 It's odd.
Usually, he warns me.

959
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,878
In the time of his father,
you would not have come.

960
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:43,948
There's nothing to sign?
 No.

961
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:45,309
 Thank you very much.

962
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:59,637
 Bazil, this blackmail evidence, what is it?

963
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:01,672
 It may be a video...

964
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:04,713
...tape, envelopes,
photos...

965
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,116
It can be anything
and anywhere.

966
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,149
 Thank's for the clarification.

967
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:11,279
 From there, please.

968
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:14,553
 That slab...

970
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:24,519
 Where's this package?

971
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:27,155
 I understand, it was there.

972
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:28,919
 The nanny has put it away?

973
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:31,475
 No, your son is with his mother.

974
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:33,716
 His mother...
Ah yes, true.

975
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,513
Get me the package.

976
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:38,712
 I assure you...
 Just go.

977
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:42,512
Oh, this'll be sweet...

978
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:52,189
*...this afternoon in Aubervilliers Arsenal...*

979
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:54,596
*...doing extensive damage.*

980
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:56,677
* No casualties were reported.*

981
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:59,872
*An investigation is underway
to determine the causes.*

982
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:03,596
*...recall the CEO
Nicolas Thibault de Fenouillet...*

983
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:06,713
*...has been cited in cases of influence peddling...*

984
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,673
*...but he's not been replaced at this time.*

985
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:11,916
*I defy anyone to make...*
*Rubbish.*

986
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:13,792
*...no tangible evidence!*

987
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:16,036
*It's a scandal!*

988
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:17,958
*Ongoing information on LCI.*

995
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:39,314
 Calm, calm...Breath.

997
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:45,271
Practice:
The key issues.

998
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:47,039
Number 12: Who...

999
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:49,470
...invents jokes?

1000
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:53,594
No. 27: Why is the place we seek on a
map always in the fold?

1001
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:57,236
No. 62: How much erosion is caused by walking?

1003
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:04,314
*The CEO,
Nicolas Thibault de Fenouillet...*

1004
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:07,757
*...has been cited in cases of influence peddling...*

1005
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:10,031
*...and has been fired.*


1007
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:12,469
*Ah! Rubbish!*

1008
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:14,079
*...no tangible evidence!*

1009
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:15,076
*It's a setup.*

1010
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:17,635
*Ongoing information on LCI.*


1012
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:26,191
 So you want war?

1013
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:28,311
It will be the blitzkrieg!

1014
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:30,033
 Sir, We Have a go?

1015
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:31,475
 Go!

1016
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:33,712
 Go.
 Go.

1017
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:35,389
 Go!

1020
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:12,788
 Ah! What now!...

1022
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:33,670
 That's it then?

1023
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:38,278
You thought we'd rot in prison?

1024
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:41,678
You're impressed by our rresolve?

1027
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:53,758
 Exercise # 8: Money...

1028
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:56,952
Dough, cash, money, moola, wonga, lucre, grease...

1029
01:17:57,240 --> 01:17:59,834
...dosh, pennies!

1033
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:16,469
 Yeah!

1043
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:47,276
 No!

1044
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:50,916
 Tut tut tut...Hush.

1046
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:53,955
 Oh...

1054
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:29,675
 Oh! No!

1056
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:40,514
 I came to give you a little lesson...

1057
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:44,873
...but these clowns gave me another idea.

1058
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:49,473
 Oh no...

1060
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,069
 How?

1062
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:56,837
 You'd never take such a risk.

1063
01:19:57,760 --> 01:19:59,034
 What risk?

1064
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:05,270
You refused to sell arms to rebels
who were formenting a coup.

1065
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:07,994
They planted a bomb in Arsenals...

1066
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:10,350
...before coming to attack you!

1067
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:13,279
We rushed to your aid...

1068
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:15,434
Isn't that so, Libarski?

1069
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:17,551
 We arrived a bit too late.

1070
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:20,519
 This is perfect.

1071
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:22,028
 Wait, wait...

1076
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:40,916
 Ah!

1077
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:43,589
 I'll give you the tape with the evidence.

1078
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:46,519
The teeth, fingers, the looting of Baghdad Museum.

1079
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:49,155
You take it and you leave.

1080
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:53,319
 It's not enough.

1081
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:56,433
 Oh, okay,
stop your bullshit!

1082
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:01,354
Ok,
I would not have sabotaged your plant.

1083
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:03,238
But you stole my shells.

1084
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:05,556
 What shells?

1085
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:07,753
 Well...

1086
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:09,879
...the shell truck.

1087
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:12,996
 You stole a shell truck.

1088
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:14,872
We did what?
 No.

1089
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:16,790
 It wasn't us.

1090
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:19,519
The truck, wasn't me.

1091
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:22,189
 It was probably them.

1092
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:25,834
 Yes, it must be them.

1093
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:28,635
 Him...it's him!

1094
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:31,639
He was spotted in the video!

1095
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:33,399
He was disguised as a server!

1096
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:35,716
I thought he worked for you.

1097
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,319
 I thought he worked for you...

1098
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:38,874
...dirty trick number 2.

1099
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:42,152
What madness!
Who do you work for?

1100
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:46,115
 Er...I'm on my own.

1101
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:49,511
 I have a bachelor flat.

1102
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:51,313
We'll question him there?

1103
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:53,272
 My car is outside.

1104
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:55,118
 I'm not too early!

1105
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:58,119
You're late.
The problem is over.

1106
01:21:58,920 --> 01:21:59,750
 That's him.

1108
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,149
 Oh...

1109
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,195
 Aeschylus died after...

1110
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:07,993
...a turtle hit his head.

1111
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:12,512
JeanBaptiste Lully,
died of gangrene.

1112
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:16,952
Barbarossa, by forgetting to remove
his armor to cross a river.

1113
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:21,870
And me, I'm dying stupidly too,
feeling like a jerk.

1120
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:04,675
 Closet, Plan B.

1121
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:09,829
Emergency!

1127
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:28,434
Everyone out!

1130
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:43,479
Come on, jump!

1131
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:53,037
 240, 230...

1132
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:55,072
...220, 210...

1133
01:24:55,840 --> 01:25:00,118
*...200, 190, 180, 170...

1134
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:02,709
*...160, 150...

1135
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:06,392
*...130, 120...

1136
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:09,114
*...110, 90, 70...

1137
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:12,957
And .. and...and...now!

1138
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:14,639
 Drop the trash!

1139
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:25,115
 Slowly.

1140
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:40,279
 Oh shit...

1141
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:42,278
 It picks up garbage!

1143
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:17,678
They're over us...
on the bridge!

1144
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:20,793
The carrots are cooked,
you have drawn a blank!

1146
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:24,153
 Hope you enjoy the sun.

1147
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:26,670
We're paying for your vacation to North Africa.

1149
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:37,160
 Closet, good landing, thank you

1150
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:40,079
 He! He! It's...
 RECYCLED'!!!


1152
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:57,355
 Again!

1153
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:00,989
Again!

1164
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:48,108
 You recognise this?

1165
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:07,672
And you, recognise this?

1168
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:24,392
Shhh! Tut tut tut...

1169
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:25,999
Don't move.

1170
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:28,389
Don't move.

1171
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:45,232
 You want a ransom?!

1172
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:50,589
Demand a price  we can afford it.

1174
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:53,755
 I'm Friends...

1175
01:28:54,040 --> 01:28:55,871
...with the President of the Republic.

1176
01:28:56,160 --> 01:28:59,311
Take away this grenade, it's ridiculous!

1177
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:03,390
We'll call,
you'll see, he will pay

1178
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:05,033
 Articulate, idiot!

1179
01:29:10,240 --> 01:29:11,389
 What do you want?

1180
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:16,317
 Sorry...

1181
01:29:16,600 --> 01:29:18,556
...for the kids.

1182
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:23,318
 Ah yes...
Sorry.

1183
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:24,999
 Apologies to the women...

1184
01:29:25,280 --> 01:29:27,350
...who are raped
in the wars!

1185
01:29:27,640 --> 01:29:30,916
 I sell weapons to people
who stop wars.

1186
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:32,189
 You bastard!

1187
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:34,710
You still sell
Landmines!

1188
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:42,274
I'm for terrorism.
Me too.

1189
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:44,755
 The Boeing 300 who died in Ankara...

1190
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:47,395
The explosive were ours!

1191
01:29:47,680 --> 01:29:50,513
 You were using  I was providing...

1192
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:52,313
...ETA and the IRA.

1193
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:56,195
 And Darfur, where do you think
they get their explosives from?

1194
01:29:56,840 --> 01:29:58,910
 You encouraged the markets?

1195
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:01,111
Kind of pathetic!

1225
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:08,238
*Video traffickers

1227
01:33:20,920 --> 01:33:22,911
 Go to YouTube...

1228
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:25,794
...and type
"arms dealers caught".

1230
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:48,875
 Guys, come see.

1233
01:33:57,240 --> 01:33:59,037
*Mr. Marconi, please!*

1234
01:33:59,320 --> 01:34:01,675
*The price of your shares collapsed.*

1235
01:34:01,960 --> 01:34:05,475
*You may serve 15 years.
What's your defense?*

1236
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:07,637
*We can send you a YouTube link...*

1238
01:34:10,440 --> 01:34:13,796
*Fenouillet dropped by his former political friends...*

1239
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:16,594
*...by the President himself...*

1240
01:34:16,840 --> 01:34:19,035
*...has fled to an unknown location...*

1241
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:23,950
*We expect one day to see the closing
of Arsenals Aubervilliers.*

1244
01:34:37,680 --> 01:34:39,989
 As soon as the 2 merchants of death hit the floor...

1245
01:34:40,280 --> 01:34:44,398
...Bazil, proud as Lucifer,
beat his breast and made amends...

1247
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:51,075
There's no need
to be a genius...

1248
01:34:51,360 --> 01:34:54,397
...to understand that they would
see with eyes of Chimene.

1249
01:34:54,680 --> 01:34:56,193
And it was no secret...

1250
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:59,040
...they get along like a house on fire.


1261
01:39:50,720 --> 01:39:53,280
