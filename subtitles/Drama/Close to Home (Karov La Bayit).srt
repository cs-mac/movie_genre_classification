1
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,050
All of it.

2
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:03,059
X-ray!

3
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,009
X-ray!

4
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,368
To the censor.

5
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,615
X-ray!

6
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:43,411
You need a new I.D. card it's illegible.

7
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,537
Finish the inspection.

8
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:51,177
I got two different sized shoes

9
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,454
at the induction center.

10
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:55,691
- I thought would be better...
- Not now

11
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,136
if you have any question I'll be outside.

12
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:29,455
You can get dressed.

13
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:42,738
Get to the booth and do you job.

14
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,333
- I'm not going in!
- You are going in!

15
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:48,413
- Dana get into the booth right now!
- I can't.

16
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,014
You can. Get into the booth.

17
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:55,457
I can't do it anymore. I can't!

18
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:59,135
Don't you understand? I can't! I can't!

19
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,575
Lower your voice!

20
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:06,179
I want to see a mental health officer!

21
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,979
You know I can't get you one now.

22
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,255
We'll take care of it later.

23
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,537
Now do your job. You have no choice!

24
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,732
Are you going in?

25
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:32,458
I won't undress this woman. I won't do it!

26
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,978
- Can you here?
- Go ahead smoke.

27
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,938
Dana keep your personal opinions at home.

28
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,375
You don't have a choice.

29
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,408
What's going on?

30
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,889
You can home.

31
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,491
Go!

32
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,136
- Why?
- I don't believe in it.

33
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,938
You always get into trouble.

34
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,692
I'll show her an inspection!

35
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,930
Can you tell me what you're doing!

36
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,339
Dana calm down!

37
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:21,890
Everyone come in! You go home!

38
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,379
Go Home! Get out!

39
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,099
- How many are you letting in?
- As I feel like.

40
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:31,208
Everybody stand still.
Take their ID's least.

41
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,098
Everyone go home!

42
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,933
- What are you doing?
- Whatever I have to.

43
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,248
You Idiot! Dubek will screw us!

44
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,489
Dubek my ass!

45
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,332
Go ahead. Go ahead.

46
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,650
Excuse me... Step into the booth.

47
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,129
- Don't go in!
- Go in!

48
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,699
- Step into the booth!
- She's not!

49
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:50,169
The hell with you "step in"!

50
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,854
- What do you care?
- Why do you car!

51
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,770
I care!

52
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,976
Everyone go home! Go Home! Goodbye!

53
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:01,737
Step inside. Everyone go home!

54
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,970
Go home everyone go home.

55
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,732
Go home.

56
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,333
Enough. Go home!

57
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,570
You and you. Everyone go home!

58
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,456
Goodbye.

59
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,734
What's going on here!

60
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:16,450
Excuse me everyone please leave.

61
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:19,498
Go out.

62
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,010
What's going on here?

63
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,571
What's going on here?

64
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,776
I'm waiting for an explanation!

65
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,417
We'll step here all night!

66
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,174
I want answer!

67
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,897
I have no problem...

68
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,129
...having you all court-martialed!

69
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,529
I want to say that I didn't participate.

70
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,178
What?

71
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,892
I didn't do it.

72
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:06,490
What she's trying to say is that I did it.

73
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,255
Everyone get into the booths.

74
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,490
Get into the booths now!

75
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,776
Dana come outside with me.

76
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:32,494
- How was your day?
- Fine.

77
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,378
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

78
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:38,899
- What do you mean nothing?
- It was okay.

79
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:41,130
- Did something happen?
- No.

80
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,132
- Are you sure?
- Nothing happened.

81
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,892
If something happened! I want to know.

82
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,891
Nothing happened!

83
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,891
Then what?

84
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,892
Maybe I should move to another unit.

85
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,210
Wait a while you don't know anything yet.

86
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,450
Give it some time.

87
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:00,259
You thing someplace else will be better?

88
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,410
Maybe you'll make some friends.

89
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,649
What friend?

90
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,696
Not everyone does what he likes

91
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:06,849
...in the army. You mother used...

92
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:07,816
to make tea did she complain?

93
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:11,290
I made tea? I didn't only make tea!

94
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,654
I did other things too.

95
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,696
Why are you getting upset?

96
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,414
I'm not upset. Besides what did you do?

97
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,376
Never mind.

98
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,496
We're not talking about you now.

99
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,810
So what do you want us to do?

100
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,619
Maybe you can help me.

101
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,089
Daddy don't you know anyone?

102
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,533
I don't like it.

103
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:33,010
- What don't you like?
- Pulling strings.

104
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,892
Mom pull up over here.

105
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,733
Why? Are you ashamed of us?

106
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,651
Pull over okay.

107
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:54,699
- Mom Pull over already!
- okay.

108
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:00,450
- When are you coming home?
- I don't know.

109
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:04,852
- At five?
- It's the army how should I know?

110
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,174
okay girls as far as

111
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:12,775
I'm concerned summer camp is over!

112
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,579
Dana is in prison and she won't be back.

113
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,810
You don't realize what happened

114
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,015
at the border crossing.

115
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,658
therefore I have no problem whatsoever

116
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:26,736
to put more girls in jail. Is that clear!

117
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,096
I'm splitting up the old pairs

118
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,899
and I don't want to here a peep.

119
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,132
There'll be new couples now.

120
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:42,219
Rotem and Yedida. Tamer and Ruthie.

121
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,337
Lee and Jeanette. Adi and Nitzan.

122
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,617
Jackie and Ronit. Yifat and Perach.

123
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,931
Michal and Shiri. Tali and Rachel.

124
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:55,649
- What about me?
- Have I finished?

125
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:01,372
You'll join a different couple each time ok?

126
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,337
We forget the new ones.

127
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,092
I haven't finished yet!

128
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,489
I haven't finished talking.

129
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:13,969
Two new soldiers have joined the util.

130
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:18,095
Smader Mirit.

131
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:23,019
Say hello. You'll be patrolling together.

132
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,494
You're screwed.

133
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:49,213
You sector begins where we stared out

134
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,574
and ends over there.

135
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,888
Do you see that yellow pole?

136
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,208
The one with the sign on it.

137
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,131
That's where it ends.

138
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,858
Don't move away from this area.

139
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,896
Don't sit down. Don't lean.

140
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,459
Don't talk on the cell phone.

141
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,098
Don't eat don't smoke.

142
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,648
No no no no!

143
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,174
What do you do? This.

144
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:10,138
- Do you know what to do with this?
- Yes.

145
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,419
there are stores and coffee shops

146
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,616
but they don't exist for you.

147
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,974
- Understand?
- Yes.

148
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,858
- Don't we get a break?
- Have I finished?

149
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:23,532
Between 10:00-10::30 and 14:00-14::30

150
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,496
and you'd better stick to the schedule...

151
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,571
because we check.

152
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,934
I see that...

153
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,533
the problem with your shoes is solved.

154
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,009
They gave me new ones but they're tight.

155
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,172
They'll stretch on patrol.

156
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,774
Go on get to work.

157
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:45,650
Your ass will stretch on patrol.

158
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:07,894
- Shall we go?
- Where to?

159
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,652
To the signpost.

160
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,696
Why the signpost? We can go over there.

161
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,133
I don't care.

162
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,734
If you don't care we'll go to the signpost.

163
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,648
It's good that you put her with the squealer.

164
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,810
What's good about it?

165
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,812
Nothing it's just a feeling.

166
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,653
You don't say. Drive!

167
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:07,574
- Are your shoes tint?
- Yes! Why?

168
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:10,652
No reason. You're walking slowly...

169
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,573
If you don't like my pace...

170
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,378
you can walk faster.

171
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,572
Do they Look like Arabs?

172
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,571
Why are you asking me?

173
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,730
I thing we should go over to them.

174
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,050
Then go.

175
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:51,492
- Excuse me good morning.

176
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,616

179
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,251
It's not here. I can't find it.

180
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,092
Why don't you Look again.

181
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,499

182
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,775

00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,975

00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,334

185
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,933
No he has to show his ID.

186
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,409
- Soldier my bus.
- Let him go.

187
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,219
No he must show the ID.

188
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,250
Sorry sir I must see your ID

189
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,331

00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,419
I also have to check your bag.

192
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,172
- Can I go.
- Yes my bag.

193
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,490

194
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:15,413

195
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,217
Come.

196
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,168
I found it.

197
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:37,776
I'm sorry I...

198
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,860
Why are you sorry?

199
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,977
You're such a moron.

200
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,610
Thank you.

201
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,609
- Where are you forms?
- Mirit has them.

202
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,179
Do we have to hand them in?

203
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,454
What did you thing?

204
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:26,452
Do you want to keep them as a souvenir?

205
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,374
You didn't white anything down.

206
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:38,531
As for tomorrow
we won't accept such forms.

207
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:08,014
- Excuse me!
- What?

208
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:18,457
- It doesn't  good.
- What?

209
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:26,935
It really... really doesn't  good on you.

210
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,170
You don't say?

211
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:55,099
- Will see you when I get back?
- Maybe.

212
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:00,779
- What'll we do?
- We might go to a movie.

213
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:08,294
- Will I see you in ten hours?
- Twelve.

214
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,848
Excuse me.

215
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,658
May I see your ID care please?

216
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,219
Yes.

217
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:05,329
My name is Bashir Hassan abu-Mussa.

218
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:11,929
- From Ram Allah?
- Yes Ram Allah.

219
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,971
Thank you.

220
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:29,137
- Are you cold?
- A little.

221
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:32,815
Why don't we warm up somewhere?

222
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,572
Go.

223
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:43,135
Hey.

224
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,570
- Nice hat isn't it?
- Yes.

225
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:53,254
- Go in and try it on.
- No not now.

226
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:56,298
You like it try it on. We'll keep watch.

227
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,608
It's too expensive.

228
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,656
But you can try it on can't you?

229
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,695
I'm not going to buy

230
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,850
it so I won't just try it on.

231
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,896
Too bad.

232
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,500
Come in come in.

233
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,651
Do you want to try the hat on?

234
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:18,494
- No not now.
- okay.

235
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,608
I'm making some tea.

236
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,460
She makes me nervous.

237
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,376
Don't you want to sit down?

238
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:33,293
No it's okay.

239
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:42,533
Sit down! Let her keep guard.

240
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,970
Julia haven't you finished that sweater?

241
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,459
It's a new one.

242
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,292
What will you do with all of them?

243
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,415
I see them.

244
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,094
- Dose it pay?
- of course.

245
00:21:56,340 --> 00:22:00,731
- Hello.
- Listen Dubek is in the area.

246
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:04,335
C'mon let's go. Inspection!

247
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,172
Move!

248
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:29,258
Give me two bagels please.

249
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:41,253
- Hello.
- Hello.

250
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,729
Dubek is on the way.

251
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,214
Forget the bagel thanks.

252
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,975
- Dubek is on the way?
- What's on the way?

253
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:56,973
C'mon I don't think they'll be back.

254
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,254
That's it I'm going.

255
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,978
- Bye.
- Bye.

256
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,539
- Hello.
- Hello.

257
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:17,054
I'd like to make an appointment.

258
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,209
Why make an appointment?

259
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,972
I'll be right with you.

260
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,778
I only have half an hour...

261
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,976
I'll be done in a minute...

262
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,816
No I don't want a haircut.

263
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,618
I only want to take a Look

264
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,531
I Love these challenges.

265
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,053
In my opinion...

266
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:54,291
we can play with the bangs.

267
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,371
I'll bleach your bangs blonde.

268
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:59,213
when you were your beret

269
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,291
you can put some gel on it.

270
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:04,178
And when you take off the beret

271
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:07,297
it's still sculptured and flowing...

272
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,735
If I'm not mistaken...

273
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,731
someone is Looking at you all time.

274
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:14,778
Don't Look. I'll turn the chair around a bit.

275
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:18,648
What a pain in the ass!

276
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:21,379
She's just like clockwork!

277
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,020
I'll come back some other time.

278
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,328
Why are you following me?

279
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,569
The break is over.

280
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,410
So I'm worried about you

281
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,377
Don't worried about me!

282
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:57,055
Yes.

283
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:02,897
May I speak to you?

284
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,658
Yes?

285
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,212
I don't want to make any trouble maybe

286
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,655
it's too early but I want to know if there's...

287
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:21,619
a chance of moving to another unit?

288
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,292
Sit down.

289
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:28,531
- Is something wrong with our unit?
- No.

290
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:31,214
- Is everything okay on patrol?
- Yes.

291
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,939
- You get along with the girls?
- Yes.

292
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,578
Then why do you want to move?

293
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,457
I don't know I...

294
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:40,213
I asked to be stationed far from home...

295
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,255
but I'm close to home.

296
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,739
Something wrong at home?

297
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:46,290
No... I just wanted a different kind

298
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,699
of army service far from home...

299
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:50,055
- Like what?
- I don't know.

300
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,732
An operation sergeant?

301
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,811
or a tank instructor?

302
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,777
Yes something like that.

303
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,055
You con move to another unit

304
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,858
but only after 6 months.

305
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,010
You can't do much about it now.

306
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,773
But if you'll be okay

307
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,339
and everything works out well.

308
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:09,093
I'll recommend you later on.

309
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:14,737
- So nothing can be done now?
- I'm sorry.

310
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,494
Yes, thank you.

311
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,734
Hi Smadar.

312
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,538
You've already left for the army?

313
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,576
We don't get to talk

314
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,934
we have to set fixed days.

315
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:46,057
Sweetheart I'm sorry I didn't catch you.

316
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,859
Regards from Dad and Ronni

317
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,329
As far as the maintenance fee...

318
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:53,934
I hope you remember to pay the dues.

319
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,534
Kisses. Bye.

320
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:15,331
Girls.

321
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,495
Things here are wrong.

322
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,411
According to your forms...

323
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,775
it Look like the Arabs have vanished.

324
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:25,294
But what's worse is that...

325
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,291
you're not doing your jobs properly.

326
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,689
These forms weren't meant

327
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:33,250
to be taken out for a morning walk.

328
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:37,219
These forms have a very specific purpose!

329
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,291
If there's a terror attack

330
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:43,293
what do you think I can do with such forms?

331
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,416
Here's a random form.

332
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,650
Adi and Nizan.

333
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,093
Erasures illegible handwriting.

334
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,011
Do you understand what's written?

335
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,579
I don't!

336
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:53,888
Let's go on.

337
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,459
Rotem and Yedida.

338
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:58,577
only 5 Arabs are listed in the form?

339
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:01,732
Next. Yifat and Perah.

340
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,378
This is a proper form.

341
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:05,416
This is how a form should Look.

342
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,171
When there are no complaints...

343
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:08,410
I don't complain.

344
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,695
Next.

345
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:13,419
Smader and Mirit.

346
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,855
3 people listen on the form.

347
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:20,855
only 3! What do you say about this?

348
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,890
Go ahead.

349
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,572
They were the only ones there.

350
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:30,697
"The only ones there". okay.

351
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:33,772
- Here's a map of Jerusalem.
- Shut up.

352
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:37,250
Sector 3. The entrance to the old City.

353
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,092
Jaffa Gate Jaffa Street

354
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,659
the entrance to the City.

355
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,776
There are no Arabs in the morning?

356
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:43,929
Nobody goes to work?

357
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:46,659
No more suspects? Everything is okay?

358
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:49,937
- Explain it please.
- I can't explain it.

359
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,659
How do they get into the city?

360
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,776
They fly over this sector!

361
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,293
Find another explanation.

362
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,654
I don't have one.

363
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:00,618
In sector two Yifat and Perah's sector

364
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,019
which is right next to yours

365
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,613
the page is full of names.

366
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,531
Some of the people must have passed

367
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,133
into your sectors.

368
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:09,688
What do you say about that?

369
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:13,056
Maybe I don't know what an Arab Looks like.

370
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:17,249
You don't know...

371
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:21,417
You don't know what an Arab  like?

372
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,536
okay.

373
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:26,256
No problem.

374
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,296
Where are Smader and Mirit today?

375
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,655
on buses.

376
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:37,533
I'll patrol with you today.

377
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:40,851
I'll show what an Arab Look like.

378
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,858
Sit down.

379
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:46,329
You sit on the other side.

380
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:50,214
Look straight ahead.

381
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:24,532
- Go over to him.
- To whom?

382
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:28,454
You know who. Get up and register him.

383
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,656
Get up!

384
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:41,254
Excuse me. I need your ID card.

385
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,976
Yes.

386
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,256
Thank you.

387
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:02,298
Be careful. I suggest you be careful.

388
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:06,578
From today bring your forms directly to me!

389
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:01,974
Don't start with me!

390
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,209
Don't start with me at all!

391
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,449
I'm sick and tired of you

392
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,815
and all your girlfriends!

393
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:07,969
okay I'm sorry.

394
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,937
It's always the same thing...

395
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:12,090
in every bus I take.

396
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,216
Excuse me soldiers.

397
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:14,971
What's the problem?

398
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,733
There's bag by itself
and nobody noticed it.

399
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:20,334
- Where?
- Right here on the seat.

400
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:25,700
Dose this bag belong to anyone?

401
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:29,011
- Let's stop the bus.
- Driver!

402
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,933
This bag happens to be mine.

403
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,897
I'm surprised you didn't see it.

404
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,619
- What?
- This bag belongs to me.

405
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,372
It was on the seat by itself

406
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,018
and no one noticed it.

407
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,170
- That's very serious!
- I'm sorry.

408
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,579
What good dose that do?

409
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:44,934
What do you do?

410
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:48,296
I only want her to understand. That's all!

411
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:50,098
If you all blew up now

412
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,659
her apology wouldn't help us!

413
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:52,650
Leave them alone.

414
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,492
I only want her to understand.

415
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,854
What you understand?

416
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:58,738
Who do you think you are?

417
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:01,732
Do you think we're playing here?

418
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,458
Do you thing we're enjoying?

419
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,450
Give me you ID now!

420
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:06,371
You're disturbing an officer on duty.

421
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,178
- You want my ID?
- Yes.

422
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,329
- Then I want your ID.
- No!

423
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,899
Give me you ID...

424
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,857
No... give me yours!

425
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,453
What is this?

426
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:16,929
What do you mean what is this?

427
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:17,816
You're psychopath!

428
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:20,858
- You're fresh!
- Driver we have to get off!

429
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,660
- What nerve!
- What a psychopath!

430
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:26,891
- You better watch out.
- A psychopath!

431
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,095
I'm dying of hunger.

432
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,613
Haven't you eaten all day?

433
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:35,773
I didn't get a chance.
I'm dying of the cold.

434
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:39,455
Julia come on I'll give you a lift home.

435
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:42,691
I'm coming.

436
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:45,852
Nice bike!

437
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:52,053
- Come no.
- This is so cold.

438
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:24,056
Come no.

439
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:28,491
- Stop it!
- Just a second.

440
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:32,448
I don't want to take just anything.

441
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:35,008
Take something that
you thing I want most.

442
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,852
And I'll take something...

443
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,771
I thing you want most.

444
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:42,569
- Did you here me?
- I hear you.

445
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,775
Look.

446
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,692
Didn't you bring anything sweet?

447
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:12,099
- No.
- I did.

448
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,091
Really?

449
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:18,413
- What's that?
- Nothing special.

450
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,855
Nothing special?

451
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:25,893
- Why did you take it?
- Why did you care?

452
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,618
It has nothing to do with a meal.

453
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:28,735
So what?

454
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:32,574
So why steal it I don't get it?

455
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:35,128
What don't you understand?

456
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:38,337
I needed some get... so I took it.

457
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,738
What's the matter?

458
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:45,699
I don't know I don't like it.

459
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:50,251
- What don't you like?
- That wasn't our plan.

460
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:54,853
We didn't plant our lives either.

461
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,817
I could have also stolen shaving cream.

462
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,572
So why didn't you?

463
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:01,379
Because if I need shaving cream.

464
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,894
I wound have bought it.

465
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:09,011
Why to go! You're really okay!

466
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,819
That's right. I'm really okay.

467
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:15,688
I might be a little boring
but that's how it is.

468
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:18,089
You are boring.

469
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:21,138
I think...

470
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,060
I'll go to sleep.

471
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:27,813
- You know what?
- What?

472
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:30,619
I don't know why I got into this.

473
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,930
- Stealing doesn't excite me.
- I know it.

474
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:36,012
- You're simply boring.
- oh really?

475
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,489
- You're totally fucked up!
- Excuse me!

476
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,969
You're totally fucked up!

477
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:42,413
They told me you were fuck up.

478
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,616
- They told you?
- Yes.

479
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:47,089
Go to whoever told you that...

480
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,579
- ... and tell them they're right.
- Terrific.

481
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,378
- I'm going.
- Go on.

482
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:53,691
Who said that I'm totally fucked up?

483
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,415
- Hello.
- Hi.

484
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:24,139
Is it ok if I sit down and you'll...

485
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:27,178
Yeah it's okay.
I'll keep an eye open.

486
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:30,252
Don't worry. What do I get out of it?

487
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:33,173
- What?
- Do you want anything?

488
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:37,936
okay give me a cream puff.

489
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:45,538
Thank you. Have a nice day.

490
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:47,929
Hi Julia it's Smader.

491
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,772
Is the guy at the kiosk okay?

492
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:52,169
- Did you buy something?
- A Cream puff.

493
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:54,296
- Then it's okay.
- Good.

494
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:55,733
Do you want to do some thing
on the break?

495
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,333
I can't.

496
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:00,457
That's okay. But the kiosk...

497
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,290
Excuse me where are you going?

498
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,371
What?

499
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:06,573
okay bye.

500
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:09,249
Excuse me sir please register with her.

501
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:10,329
But...

502
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:12,729
I ask you to register with her.

503
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:15,618
This is my card.

504
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:22,016
She told me to register with you.

505
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,977
I don't have the forms she does.

506
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:26,858
- Really?
- Really!

507
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,608
The other soldier said...

508
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:36,168
that you have the forms.

509
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:39,374
Come with me, please.

510
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:44,656
Take it! Register him.

511
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:49,131
You can go. Have a good day.

512
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:54,091
Why didn't you register him?

513
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,693
I didn't feel like it!

514
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:58,499
Do you intend to sit here for a Ion time?

515
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:01,013
I haven't decided yet.

516
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,330
When will you decide?

517
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:04,170
I don't know.

518
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:08,173
Excuse me I want to open the shop.

519
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,616
Forget it! I'll do it myself.

520
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,258
Give me the forms.

521
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,170
Give me the forms already!

522
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,649
Take you bloody forms!

523
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:08,049
Where is my bag? I can't find it...

524
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:10,654
My bag...

525
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,860
Where's my bag?

526
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:17,338
I can't fine my bag.

527
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:28,653
I have to go.

528
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:34,538
Come help us will these people...

529
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:38,408
Don't let anyone pass...

530
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:50,489
Mirit help me!

531
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:21,095
Are you Mirit Shimoni?

532
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:23,296
No I'm her friend.

533
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:25,814
Let her pass.

534
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,368
An hysterical woman is Looking for her.

535
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:29,575
Who's Looking for Mirit?

536
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:32,936
- I am!
- Come over here.

537
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,135
Are you Mirit's mother?

538
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,494
Have you seen her?

539
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:37,810
- I saw her she's fine.
- Are you sour?

540
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:38,696
Yes she's fine.

541
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:41,613
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

542
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,056
Mom?

543
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:24,498
No I'm okay. Everything is okay.

544
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:27,140
I wasn't at the bombing...

545
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:29,973
I was nearby.

546
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:34,453
I don't know Mom it was a mess.

547
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:38,699
Stop it Mom I'm okay.

548
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:42,692
it was a mass...

549
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:45,578
I don't remember what happened.

550
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:49,014
I'm not going to any neighbor...

551
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:50,135
and I'm not alone.

552
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:52,575
Who told you that I'm alone.

553
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:58,815
okay I'll call.

554
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:01,490
Mommy...

555
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:05,295
I miss you.

556
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:13,258
okay bye.

557
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:51,890
It's not only because of the bombing

558
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:53,493
Mirit didn't want to beginning that unit

559
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:55,696
form the beginning.

560
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:58,498
Listen sweetie...

561
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:00,377
No problem I'll phone someone.

562
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:03,338
But it takes time have a little patience.

563
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:06,332
He's right.
It's not a good idea to expect things.

564
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:07,535
Forget about it

565
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:09,178
and then one day you'll get a surprise.

566
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:13,936
From my experience the best thing to do

567
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:16,488
is to go to your commander and talk to.

568
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:19,811
I'll like you all to meet my angel.

569
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:21,049
She's the one who told me

570
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:22,414
that Mirit is okay.

571
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:25,378
I brought you your bag.

572
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:28,020
How sweet of you. eat with us.

573
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:29,852
No I only come to bring the bag.

574
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:32,090
Sit next to Mirit.

575
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:35,337
Where did you find the bag?

576
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:38,696
A policeman gave it to me

577
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:42,375
after you left he thought it was mine.

578
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:44,769
- Are you in Mirit unit? -Yes.

579
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:48,375
Poor thing you had an awful day.

580
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:57,017
Have some bread.

581
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:58,499
Maybe she doesn't feel like it.

582
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:01,538
Actually I only dropped by to bring the bag.

583
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:05,374
- People are waiting for me at home.
- Sorry.

584
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:07,530
Maybe you can leave me...

585
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:08,291
your parent's phone number

586
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:09,733
so I'll have someone to talk to...

587
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:11,617
in case something happens.

588
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:13,736
My parents are abroad.

589
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:15,219
They're abroad?

590
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:16,653
They work overseas.

591
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:20,858
So why are you going? Stay overnight.

592
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:31,172
- okay.
- okay.

593
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:47,012
Do you sleep with one pillow or two?

594
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:50,934
I sleep with two but...

595
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:53,974
one.

596
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:58,495
Actually two.

597
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:07,215
You can sleep in these.

598
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:10,053
Choose whatever you like.

599
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:16,571
okay... If you need something I'm...

600
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:22,136
- What's your mother's name?
- Yael.

601
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:25,089
And yours?

602
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:29,253
- Betty.
- Betty.

603
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:34,698
I'm only kidding it's Frieda.

604
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:42,258
Listen to it it's really a nice piece.

605
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:50,696
I like your headband.

606
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:15,572
open ranks for the Co's inspection!

607
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:18,049
open ranks. March!

608
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:20,734
one Close!

609
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:43,976
Smadar Mirit.

610
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:47,211
These girls were at the bombing.

611
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:05,811
The troop will close ranks.

612
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:08,573
ranks. March!

613
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:10,491
one Close!

614
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:13,094
Two three attention!

615
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:14,898
At ease.

616
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:19,735
Girls I know how difficult your job is.

617
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:22,175
It was important for me to come here

618
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:23,852
And to personally tell you

619
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:27,455
that I greatly appreciate your work.

620
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:28,814
Thank you.

621
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:31,289
Thank you really.

622
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:33,132
In view of the last events.

623
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:35,814
I'm escalating the alert level in the city

624
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:37,970
and our presence will be felt everywhere.

625
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:39,698
I am asking every one of you to

626
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:42,374
...open seven pairs of eyes and...

627
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:45,054
to understand the importance of your job.

628
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:48,132
while demonstrating sensitivity and

629
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:52,179
restraint towards the people you inspect.

630
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:54,490
That's all.

631
00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:01,532
I think we can begin the day.

632
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:02,689
Do you want to add something?

633
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:05,738
Actually. You covered what I want to say.

634
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:09,256
I would like to mention the hole puncher.

635
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:11,410
okay girls pay attention.

636
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:12,535
As we said...

637
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:15,293
we have hot alerts on terror attacks.

638
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:17,371
All the girls who work...

639
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:18,210
...on buses pay attention.

640
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:20,336
In order to make sure that...

641
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:22,615
you were there and did you job properly.

642
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:24,577
we decided that from today not only do...

643
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:26,173
you write down the bus number.

644
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:28,455
but you punch' your patrol forms

645
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:31,100
with the bus driver's hole puncher.

646
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:34,968
Everything else as usual.

647
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:55,333
That's the guy who helped me...

648
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:56,978
at the bombing.

649
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:03,853
- He's hot.
- He sure is.

650
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:53,011
That's far enough let's go back.

651
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:55,739
No way! Walk over to him.

652
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:57,014
I can't.

653
00:50:57,100 --> 00:51:01,252
Go ahead he'll be gone soon.

654
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:03,900
What should I do attack him?

655
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:06,699
You don't have to be so aggressive. Say...

656
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:09,613
"Thanks for helping me at the bombing. "

657
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:10,735
Do you want me to go?

658
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:12,936
Cut it out Smadar I can't.

659
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:15,659
He's going!

660
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:17,696
Mirit!

661
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:27,097
Maybe next time.

662
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:28,408
There won't be a next time.

663
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:29,979
You might not see him again.

664
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:31,891
I will I'll see him.

665
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:32,935
Are you going?

666
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:34,135
I won't have time to do this again.

667
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:36,370
Forget it.

668
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:43,055
That's it he's going!

669
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:50,133
of course! What boredom!

670
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:11,498
" Base commander"

671
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:22,498
How many buses were you on?

672
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:27,096
It's all written down.
The bus numbers too.

673
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:30,933
- Did you take a break?
- Yes.

674
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:33,215
For how Ion?

675
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:36,655
Half an hour.

676
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:40,494
- What about you?
- The same.

677
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:49,772
okay that all. see you tomorrow.

678
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:07,098
- Do you want me to give you a ride?
- No!

679
00:53:53,420 --> 00:54:00,610
- Don't miss the game.
- I won't. Bye.

680
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:14,459
- What did that guy buy?
- Cigarettes why?

681
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:17,134
What brand did he buy?

682
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:20,496
- Why?
- No special reason.

683
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:25,973
- Is there a problem?
- No, nothing, really.

684
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:30,496
- okay, never mind.
- okay, I'll tell you.

685
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:32,536
He bought "Camel Light".

686
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:34,338
You know what? It's strange.

687
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:37,059
He usually buys Camel regular.

688
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:39,256
In my opinion,

689
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:41,456
he'll smoke more of the lights.

690
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:47,491
Give me a Camel Light too and a lighter.

691
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:55,095
- How much is it?
-20 shekels.

692
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:59,010
Thanks.

693
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:31,530
Did you notice the prices want down?

694
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:33,019
Really?

695
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:36,012
Why don't you buy a hat

696
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:38,819
and make my day?

697
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:43,690
- That hat is very pretty.
- So buy it.

698
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:48,293
Not now. What if they check up on us?

699
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:51,372
- So don't buy it.
- Don't force her.

700
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:55,533
I'm right here. Where would I go?

701
00:55:57,340 --> 00:56:01,333
I can't go in now.
Someone just went by...

702
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:02,330
and we didn't register him.

703
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:03,853
Don't change the subject.

704
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:06,295
It's like the guy we followed...

705
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:07,335
and you did nothing.

706
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:10,412
It's same with the hat.
Hat and nothing!

707
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,650
Buy the already. Do something!

708
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:14,731
Who said I didn't do anything with the guy?

709
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:15,969
What did you do?

710
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:17,573
I passed by the place.

711
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:20,333
- And...
- I don't know what'll happen.

712
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:22,615
I asked what happened?

713
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:24,179
There's nothing to tell.

714
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:26,649
Did you talk to him?

715
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:28,537
Did he offer you a cup of coffee? What?

716
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:31,180
- Nothing special.
- What do you mean?

717
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:36,050
- We sat down?
- Sat down?

718
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:37,414
Do you want a cigarette?

719
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,730
where did you get a cigarettes?

720
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:43,608
It's his. He forgot them at my place.

721
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:45,338
He smokes " lights" now

722
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:47,695
because of all the muck in his lungs...

723
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:50,135
But I think he smokes more now.

724
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:51,812
He smokes light now

725
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:53,697
but I don't know what you did.

726
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:57,614
You know... since they reduced the prices

727
00:56:57,700 --> 00:56:59,975
I think I'll buy the hat.

728
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:14,574
Smadar? Dubek is in your area. Bye.

729
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:16,575
What's the matter?

730
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:19,493
Hurry up Dubek's in the area.

731
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:21,536
Great!

732
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:24,134
Don't Look back walk normally.

733
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:26,211
Are they on foot or in the jeep?

734
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:28,416
How am I supposed to know?

735
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:31,219
Too bad you didn't ask.

736
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:36,852
Where is she?

737
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:38,737
Maybe she wants to trick us.

738
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:40,538
Good thing,
I registered some in the morning.

739
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:42,531
Look straight ahead!

740
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:44,292
She's not her don't you get it?

741
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:46,098
She must have been here...

742
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:47,738
while we were in the store...

743
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:49,139
and she saw that we were missing.

744
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:51,051
Where can I do?

745
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:53,256
We're screwed.

746
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:56,093
All we need is for her to see us okay?

747
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:57,659
Let's go back to the store.

748
00:57:57,740 --> 00:58:01,096
Maybe she's there.

749
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:21,055
Hi.

750
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:24,177
- Hi.
- Hi.

751
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:30,334
Can we go?

752
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:41,172
okay girls.

753
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:43,330
The Israeli Festival is a head.

754
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:44,899
our unit is participating.

755
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:47,130
Tomorrow morning you'll report...

756
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:48,972
at the Sheraton Hotel.

757
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:51,255
The bands participating in the festival

758
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:52,853
are staying at the hotel

759
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:54,532
and we're securing the place.

760
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:56,451
I want to remind you that these

761
00:58:56,540 --> 00:58:59,657
are foreigners who agreed to come here.

762
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:01,492
So God forbid!

763
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:03,332
God forbid if something happens to them.

764
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:07,015
Is that clear?

765
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:08,533
I want you to be on maximum alert!

766
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:10,815
And of course keep your hair neat...

767
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:15,291
and your uniform ironed.

768
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:16,779
madar and Mirit

769
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:21,012
you'll be at the hotel's main entrance.

770
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:21,976
Yifat and Perach

771
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:25,018
you're at the back entrance. That's all.

772
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:30,493
I hope you'll enjoy the change.

773
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:33,016
She gave up a bonus.

774
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:36,851
- What are you doing now?
- I don't know.

775
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:38,055
You're probably going to meet...

776
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:39,778
your dude aren't you?

777
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:42,420
Yes actually.

778
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:44,972
Do you want a lift?

779
00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:47,858
No I don't remember what
we planned but..

780
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:50,010
I think he's picking me up.

781
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:53,979
- okay.
- okay.

782
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:58,975
- Bye.
- Bye.

783
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:49,376
Excuse me. What time is it please?

784
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:51,690
A quarter to seven.

785
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:02,614
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

786
01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:13,218
- Hi.
- Hi.

787
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:45,250
Thank you.

788
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:58,173
- What's he Looking at?
- You turn him on.

789
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:04,211
I know this not the right moment but

790
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:06,336
would you like to join me
for a little drink?

791
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:07,330
Now?

792
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:12,289
- I'm sorry I can't now.
- I can wait.

793
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:28,057
He's still Looking at you.

794
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:34,534
He's still Looking at you.

795
01:03:39,260 --> 01:03:40,932
Thank you.

796
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:44,657
Well?

797
01:04:13,540 --> 01:04:16,532
I think I'll go with him.

798
01:04:29,060 --> 01:04:33,576
- But only for a short while okay?
- Excellent.

799
01:05:31,620 --> 01:05:33,451
Well?

800
01:05:34,340 --> 01:05:38,811
Good evening Where is Mirit?

801
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:41,016
Good evening.

802
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:45,139
- Where is Mirit?
- In the ladies room.

803
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:49,253
- Is everything alright?
- Yes.

804
01:05:49,340 --> 01:05:51,808
I think we'll wander about for a while.

805
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:56,018
Actually,
they asked us not to wander about.

806
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:59,410
They asked you not to wander about.

807
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:43,458
- What?
- Nothing.

808
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:21,250
That's nice.

809
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:27,854
Excuse us.

810
01:07:27,940 --> 01:07:30,773
I'm sorry I need to go.

811
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:08,936
You're lucky.

812
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:21,213
What's the charge?

813
01:08:21,300 --> 01:08:22,972
Degrading an IDF uniform

814
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:24,015
and abandoning a post.

815
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:27,217
- For how Ion?
- A week.

816
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:31,649
- okay.
- okay.

817
01:08:33,140 --> 01:08:36,769
- She has to come back to me.
- okay.

818
01:08:44,140 --> 01:08:47,257
- Do you need anything?
- No.

819
01:08:48,580 --> 01:08:51,174
I have a request.

820
01:08:51,980 --> 01:08:53,857
I don't want to continue patrolling

821
01:08:53,940 --> 01:08:55,817
with Smadar when I get back.

822
01:08:56,540 --> 01:08:59,452
May I ask why?

823
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:04,208
- No.
- okay.

824
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:05,938
I'll pass on your request

825
01:09:06,020 --> 01:09:08,693
but I don't promise anything.

826
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:36,252
- Hello.
- Hello.

827
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:39,730
You don't know me
I'm Smadar Mirit's friend.

828
01:09:39,820 --> 01:09:42,698
She never told me your name...

829
01:09:42,780 --> 01:09:44,372
...doesn't matter. Dubek, our commander,

830
01:09:44,460 --> 01:09:45,370
you must have hard about,

831
01:09:45,460 --> 01:09:48,020
shoved her into jail and she didn't

832
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:50,739
get a chance to let you know.

833
01:09:50,820 --> 01:09:53,493
It would be nice
if we visit and surprise her.

834
01:09:53,580 --> 01:09:55,730
You're talking to the wrong person.

835
01:09:55,820 --> 01:09:58,129
I'm not confused. It's you.

836
01:09:58,220 --> 01:10:01,451
I have a motorbike but.
Do you have car?

837
01:10:01,540 --> 01:10:02,973
Yes.

838
01:10:03,060 --> 01:10:05,051
okay do you want us to go together?

839
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:07,938
I don't know what you're talking about.

840
01:10:08,020 --> 01:10:10,488
What don't you want? Mirit is in jail.

841
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:12,889
I'm very sorry but who's Mirit?

842
01:10:12,980 --> 01:10:14,652
What do you mean who's Mirit?

843
01:10:14,740 --> 01:10:15,775
You don't know Mirit?

844
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:17,339
No.

845
01:10:19,660 --> 01:10:21,332
She's so Cools!

846
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:23,297
She gave you a different name.

847
01:10:23,380 --> 01:10:24,859
Do you smoke Camel Light?

848
01:10:24,940 --> 01:10:27,693
- Yes.
- So?

849
01:10:31,740 --> 01:10:33,970
There must be some mistake...

850
01:10:34,060 --> 01:10:36,369
You don't know Mirit?

851
01:10:36,460 --> 01:10:37,017
The girl at the bombing?

852
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:39,170
I'm sorry it's not me.

853
01:10:40,420 --> 01:10:44,015
- I'm sorry...
- Bye.

854
01:10:58,380 --> 01:11:00,416
What do you say?

855
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:03,378
Why don't we surprise her anyway?

856
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:05,257
What do you care?

857
01:11:05,340 --> 01:11:06,534
Do you something nice. I'll be cool.

858
01:11:06,620 --> 01:11:07,939
Sorry I don't have the time.

859
01:11:08,020 --> 01:11:09,533
What do you mean?

860
01:11:09,620 --> 01:11:11,576
What do you have to do?

861
01:11:11,660 --> 01:11:12,615
I'm sorry I can't.

862
01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:16,773
It's just that... okay.

863
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:19,215
Fuck you.

864
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:22,815
okay? Go fuck yourself.

865
01:11:35,540 --> 01:11:38,612
Rise and Shine! Good morning.

866
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:41,214
Get up!
You're not at the Regency Palace!

867
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:43,450
- Dana good morning.
- Good morning.

868
01:11:43,540 --> 01:11:44,655
You've got 7 minutes

869
01:11:44,740 --> 01:11:46,537
to get into your fatigues.

870
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:49,738
Get up. Rise and Shine.
Good morning.

871
01:11:49,820 --> 01:11:52,937
- Did you get cigarettes?
- I don't smoke.

872
01:11:53,020 --> 01:11:55,011
From now on you smoke...

873
01:11:55,100 --> 01:12:00,094
and you give me your cigarettes okay?

874
01:12:00,180 --> 01:12:02,569
Good morning wake up!

875
01:12:02,660 --> 01:12:06,335
Get up! Get up!

876
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:10,538
- What's your name?
- Mirit.

877
01:12:11,540 --> 01:12:13,576
Mirit.

878
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:25,254
You don't say? That's great.

879
01:12:25,340 --> 01:12:30,698
I don't know what I'd do... I'd...

880
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:34,409
You're so great.

881
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:39,529
What!

882
01:12:41,220 --> 01:12:43,211
Jusmin!

883
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:46,493
- What's up?
- You don't say.

884
01:12:46,580 --> 01:12:48,616
That's great...

885
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:51,856
No way...

886
01:12:54,660 --> 01:12:57,970
- You Look familiar.
- I don't know...

887
01:12:58,060 --> 01:13:00,290
I'll get right back to you.

888
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:02,894
Dana move it! keep up with the pace

889
01:13:02,980 --> 01:13:03,856
Why it's not fast enough?

890
01:13:03,940 --> 01:13:05,692
- No.
- Why not?

891
01:13:05,780 --> 01:13:07,930
Don't get wise I'm warning you.

892
01:13:08,020 --> 01:13:09,897
What'll you do send me to jail?

893
01:13:09,980 --> 01:13:11,493
What did you say?

894
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:13,377
Nothing.

895
01:13:13,460 --> 01:13:16,770
What are you Looking at?
Keep working!

896
01:13:30,780 --> 01:13:32,691
Hey.

897
01:13:34,220 --> 01:13:37,417
You still don't know where we met?

898
01:13:38,660 --> 01:13:40,378
No.

899
01:13:40,460 --> 01:13:41,893
At the border crossing.

900
01:13:41,980 --> 01:13:44,892
I'm the one who said
" I didn't participate".

901
01:13:44,980 --> 01:13:46,891
oh yeah!

902
01:13:49,860 --> 01:13:50,975
What am I supposed to do

903
01:13:51,100 --> 01:13:53,455
with that information now?

904
01:13:55,460 --> 01:13:57,576
Nothing.

905
01:13:57,660 --> 01:13:59,412
There's nothing you can do with it.

906
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:01,172
Absolutely.

907
01:14:01,340 --> 01:14:02,898
What's going on here?

908
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:04,777
The minute I turn my back...

909
01:14:04,860 --> 01:14:08,489
you start fooling around!

910
01:14:08,580 --> 01:14:11,856
You won't go to sleep tonight!

911
01:14:38,260 --> 01:14:40,091
I thought you weren't coming.

912
01:14:40,180 --> 01:14:42,899
We got Lost on the way.

913
01:14:42,980 --> 01:14:46,097
We brought you a cheesecake...

914
01:14:46,180 --> 01:14:47,010
the kind you like.

915
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:51,696
- Be careful.
- Gently so it doesn't fall apart.

916
01:14:51,780 --> 01:14:54,010
Have are you honey?

917
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:57,490
You don't have much time left
so be strong.

918
01:14:57,580 --> 01:14:59,411
I spoke to Shaul.

919
01:14:59,580 --> 01:15:01,457
He's working on your reassignment.

920
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:03,735
Really?

921
01:15:04,060 --> 01:15:07,609
And we brought you a visitor.

922
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:22,655
Let's go.

923
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:26,891
You poor folk I clung to them.

924
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:28,333
I had to see you.

925
01:15:28,420 --> 01:15:30,217
You left me all alone.

926
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:32,734
I got you something.

927
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:40,060
open it.

928
01:15:43,700 --> 01:15:45,816
Go ahead try it on.

929
01:15:57,460 --> 01:15:59,451
I'm dying to see it on you.

930
01:15:59,540 --> 01:16:03,010
Well It doesn't go too well with green.

931
01:16:05,900 --> 01:16:09,859
Move it sideways a little.

932
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:17,699
A little more... that's it.

933
01:16:17,780 --> 01:16:19,930
Cut it out. This has is just not me.

934
01:16:20,020 --> 01:16:22,488
I think it Look very nice on you.

935
01:16:22,580 --> 01:16:24,411
I mean... maybe not right now

936
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:26,650
Not now or ever.

937
01:16:26,740 --> 01:16:30,415
- But you like it.
- And now I don't like it.

938
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:33,060
- I don't understand.
- Why?

939
01:16:33,140 --> 01:16:36,132
This hat doesn't solve everything.

940
01:16:36,220 --> 01:16:38,290
What's wrong?

941
01:16:39,060 --> 01:16:41,699
I don't think we'll continue together.

942
01:16:41,780 --> 01:16:43,372
What are you talking about?

943
01:16:43,460 --> 01:16:47,135
We'll go to Dubek and fight for it.

944
01:16:52,780 --> 01:16:56,409
I asked them to separate us.

945
01:16:58,420 --> 01:17:00,331
Fine.

946
01:17:01,460 --> 01:17:03,690
obviously!

947
01:17:23,740 --> 01:17:26,493
Easy calm down.

948
01:17:26,580 --> 01:17:28,093
My husband is inside.

949
01:17:28,180 --> 01:17:30,740
All our husbands are inside.

950
01:17:30,820 --> 01:17:32,253
He won't find me.

951
01:17:32,340 --> 01:17:36,333
- It's better that way.
- Let us enter.

952
01:17:36,420 --> 01:17:37,739
If my husband won't find me hoe will...

953
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:38,650
I get home?

954
01:17:38,740 --> 01:17:40,810
Never mind your husband... Enough!

955
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:43,414
We're waiting all day!

956
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:48,939
- You feel like smoking?
- okay.

957
01:18:00,380 --> 01:18:04,134
Let's ask Dubek
if we can patrol together.

958
01:18:04,220 --> 01:18:07,417
But I'm being discharged in days.

959
01:18:07,980 --> 01:18:10,699
That's it. And then I'm leaving.

960
01:18:10,780 --> 01:18:13,374
- Where to?
- To Russia.

961
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:15,969
Why do you think...

962
01:18:16,060 --> 01:18:17,652
I knitted all those sweaters?

963
01:18:17,740 --> 01:18:18,650
I've got everything ready.

964
01:18:18,740 --> 01:18:21,459
I have a ticket I have money.

965
01:18:26,420 --> 01:18:30,538
This is Sasha. I'm going to him.

966
01:18:30,620 --> 01:18:33,088
He's so cute. Who is he?

967
01:18:33,180 --> 01:18:34,693
He's my boyfriend.

968
01:18:34,780 --> 01:18:40,173
- But he's just a kid.
- So what!

969
01:18:40,260 --> 01:18:43,411
This picture is 10 years old.

970
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:46,139
Don't you have a current picture?

971
01:18:46,580 --> 01:18:47,933
He doesn't send any.

972
01:18:48,020 --> 01:18:49,692
He's afraid I'll disappointed.

973
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:53,012
great you opened a coffee shop.

974
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:56,729
Madam come here please.

975
01:18:57,620 --> 01:19:00,054
Sweetheart were you promoted?

976
01:19:00,140 --> 01:19:02,210
No I promotes myself.

977
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:04,768
I can't stay unit 11 p. m.
because of you.

978
01:19:04,860 --> 01:19:06,452
okay.

979
01:19:06,540 --> 01:19:10,010
open the bag. Take everything out.

980
01:19:36,820 --> 01:19:39,459
Throw away the pita.

981
01:19:41,700 --> 01:19:43,611
Why?

982
01:19:43,700 --> 01:19:46,498
Throw away the pita in the garbage!

983
01:19:46,580 --> 01:19:50,129
He hasn't eaten all day Ion.

984
01:19:50,220 --> 01:19:52,176
Do you see what's writing here?

985
01:19:52,260 --> 01:19:54,490
What does it say?

986
01:19:55,140 --> 01:20:02,854
" Do not enter with food".

987
01:20:03,660 --> 01:20:07,016
What's that?

988
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:12,534
Throw the pita into the garbage.

989
01:20:12,620 --> 01:20:15,657
I won't throw the pita into the garbage.

990
01:20:15,740 --> 01:20:17,298
You don't have a choice.

991
01:20:17,380 --> 01:20:18,813
Throw it into the garbage.

992
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:21,289
What's in the pita.

993
01:20:21,380 --> 01:20:22,972
I don't care what's in the pita.

994
01:20:23,060 --> 01:20:25,016
- But what's in it?
- I don't care!

995
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:27,091
What's in the pita?

996
01:20:27,180 --> 01:20:30,570
Cheese a pickle and olives.

997
01:20:30,660 --> 01:20:32,173
Take it out of my face!

998
01:20:32,260 --> 01:20:33,534
What's in the pita?

999
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:37,693
- Go to hell.

- Hello.
- Hello.

1002
01:20:59,220 --> 01:21:03,771
- You don't remember me.
- No.

1003
01:21:03,860 --> 01:21:06,852
You don't remember me
from the bombing?

1004
01:21:06,940 --> 01:21:09,852
I'm the girl you helped.

1005
01:21:09,940 --> 01:21:13,774
- Wait a minute is your name Mirit?
- Yes.

1006
01:21:13,860 --> 01:21:16,055
You were released from prison?

1007
01:21:17,540 --> 01:21:19,371
Yes how do you know?

1008
01:21:19,460 --> 01:21:21,212
Do you remember the soldier...

1009
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:22,528
I told you about?

1010
01:21:22,620 --> 01:21:23,496
No.

1011
01:21:23,580 --> 01:21:25,536
The one who knocked on our door

1012
01:21:25,620 --> 01:21:27,178
and to go with her begged me

1013
01:21:27,260 --> 01:21:30,332
to come asked me with her to visit

1014
01:21:30,420 --> 01:21:31,569
her best friend in prison.

1015
01:21:31,700 --> 01:21:33,816
Did she have black hair

1016
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:35,379
and a light complexion?

1017
01:21:35,460 --> 01:21:37,178
I think so.

1018
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:39,899
Was she short like me
with Ion eyelashes?

1019
01:21:39,980 --> 01:21:41,777
Yes, that's the one.

1020
01:21:41,860 --> 01:21:44,169
Is that the girl she wanted you to visit?

1021
01:21:44,260 --> 01:21:46,820
I think so.

1022
01:21:46,900 --> 01:21:48,458
Would you like to join us?

1023
01:21:48,540 --> 01:21:49,973
No I...

1024
01:21:50,060 --> 01:21:52,699
I just wanted to thank you for helping me.

1025
01:21:52,780 --> 01:21:55,578
I was glad to help.

1026
01:22:13,020 --> 01:22:15,170
Who wants chocolate cake?

1027
01:22:15,260 --> 01:22:17,410

1028
01:22:18,180 --> 01:22:20,250

1031
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:25,131
Julia.

1032
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:39,139
Lucky her.

1033
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:41,290
Commander Liat...

1034
01:22:41,380 --> 01:22:45,009
- Yes Julia?
- I have a gift for you.

1035
01:22:50,740 --> 01:22:52,093
I knit it myself.

1036
01:22:52,180 --> 01:22:54,455
- Really?
- Yes.

1037
01:22:54,940 --> 01:22:58,057
It's beautiful thank you.

1038
01:22:58,140 --> 01:22:59,493
Thank you thank you.

1039
01:22:59,580 --> 01:23:01,571
Girls be quiet for a minute

1040
01:23:01,660 --> 01:23:03,013
I want to say some thing.

1041
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:06,217
Julia is leaving us today...

1042
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:10,335
So I wish her success in her future life.

1043
01:23:10,420 --> 01:23:11,535
Julia I hope...

1044
01:23:11,620 --> 01:23:14,214
that when you Look back at these days

1045
01:23:14,300 --> 01:23:15,289
you'll have...

1046
01:23:15,380 --> 01:23:17,655
a few nice moments to remember.

1047
01:23:20,300 --> 01:23:22,734

1051
01:23:29,660 --> 01:23:32,299
- Good luck Julia.

1052
01:23:32,380 --> 01:23:34,450
Pay attention!

1053
01:23:40,660 --> 01:23:44,778
Girls Julia may have all the time

1054
01:23:44,860 --> 01:23:47,169

1055

01:25:36,740 --> 01:25:37,889
I don't want to.

1076
01:25:37,980 --> 01:25:40,653
- Why not?
- Do you mind not interfering?

1077
01:25:40,740 --> 01:25:41,616
Will you listen to me?

1078
01:25:41,700 --> 01:25:43,691
If she's here I'm out.

1079
01:25:43,780 --> 01:25:45,498

Sit down.

1085
01:25:52,740 --> 01:25:55,129
I apologize. I'm sorry.

1086
01:25:55,220 --> 01:25:56,812
Who's angry anyway?

1087
01:25:56,900 --> 01:25:59,289
So why won't you talk to me?

1088
01:25:59,380 --> 01:26:00,369
Because you don't interest me!

1089
01:26:00,460 --> 01:26:03,258
So why did you go to that guy for me?

1090
01:26:03,340 --> 01:26:04,659
I was bored.

1091
01:26:04,740 --> 01:26:06,332
And why did you buy me the hat?

1092
01:26:06,420 --> 01:26:07,694

1093

1094

1095
01:26:12,780 --> 01:26:14,736
Yes I lied. You liar.

1096
01:26:14,820 --> 01:26:16,412
Maybe I'm a liar but I don't know

1097
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:18,968
why you bought me that hat.

1098
01:26:19,060 --> 01:26:20,493
I don't know okay!

1099
01:26:20,580 --> 01:26:24,368
What do you mean? " I don't know"?

1100
01:26:24,460 --> 01:26:25,734
- Tell me!
- Just because.

1101
01:26:25,820 --> 01:26:27,492
Why did you bring me the hat?

1102
01:26:27,580 --> 01:26:29,730
I don't remember.

1103
01:26:30,100 --> 01:26:32,568
Maybe you've become attached to me?

1104
01:26:34,140 --> 01:26:36,415
Bullshit.

1105
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:39,298
That's it you've become attached to me.

1106
01:26:42,700 --> 01:26:45,658
Let me spoil you. I'll shampoo your

1107
01:26:45,740 --> 01:26:48,493
hair put on a mask for split ends...

1108
01:26:48,580 --> 01:26:50,855
How about it?

1109
01:27:05,700 --> 01:27:08,055
I know...
We haven't registered anyone.

1110
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:09,493
That's right we're way out of line.

1111
01:27:09,580 --> 01:27:11,571
okay we'll do it now.

1112
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:14,016
Who will we register?

1113
01:27:14,100 --> 01:27:17,012
What are you worried about?

1114
01:27:21,780 --> 01:27:23,338
We'll find people.

1115
01:27:23,420 --> 01:27:24,853
We should have done it in the morning.

1116
01:27:24,940 --> 01:27:26,055
If they leave in the morning...

1117
01:27:26,140 --> 01:27:27,255
they come back in the evening.

1118
01:27:27,340 --> 01:27:30,252
It's not the same thing.

1119
01:27:30,780 --> 01:27:32,771
Mirit stop being uptight

1120
01:27:32,860 --> 01:27:35,169

1121
01:27:36,460 --> 01:27:37,939
Come on.

1122
01:27:41,980 --> 01:27:43,971
Excuse me may I have your ID please?

1123
01:27:44,060 --> 01:27:45,857
- We were here first.
- It isn't your area.

1124
01:27:45,940 --> 01:27:47,134
It's not yours either.

1125
01:27:47,220 --> 01:27:48,448
It's closer to us.

1126
01:27:48,540 --> 01:27:49,575
Don't fuck with me.

1127
01:27:49,660 --> 01:27:50,934
We saw him over there.

1128
01:27:51,020 --> 01:27:52,772
Really?

1129
01:27:52,860 --> 01:27:54,578
Excuse me may I please have your ID?

1130
01:27:54,660 --> 01:27:58,653
- Let her go.
- Moron.

1131
01:28:06,060 --> 01:28:07,778
What if don't give it to you?

1132
01:28:07,860 --> 01:28:09,771
What do you mean?

1133
01:28:09,860 --> 01:28:11,896
What will you do if don't give it to you?

1134
01:28:11,980 --> 01:28:16,178
- What will we do?
- Come on give it to us.

1135
01:28:16,260 --> 01:28:21,254
- I refuse.
- You have no choice.

1136
01:28:22,180 --> 01:28:24,375
What will you do to me?

1137
01:28:25,540 --> 01:28:27,576
Come on cut it out.

1138
01:28:27,660 --> 01:28:30,538
Well what will you do me?

1139
01:28:31,580 --> 01:28:33,377
What do you mean?

1140
01:28:33,460 --> 01:28:34,973
I'll report you right now.

1141
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:37,494
They'll arrest you interrogate you...

1142
01:28:37,580 --> 01:28:38,376
Shall I continue?

1143
01:28:38,460 --> 01:28:41,020
You can decide not to report me.

1144
01:28:41,100 --> 01:28:42,931
What do you say?

1145
01:28:43,420 --> 01:28:45,376
What do you say?

1146
01:28:45,460 --> 01:28:46,779
Why don't you say something?

1147
01:28:46,860 --> 01:28:47,815
Excuse me.

1148
01:28:47,900 --> 01:28:50,368
Take your hand put in into your pocket,

1152
01:28:56,820 --> 01:28:57,889

01:29:04,340 --> 01:29:08,015

1164
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:27,855
I don't need your help okay?

1165
01:29:27,940 --> 01:29:31,535
Move back Move back. I can manage.

1166
01:29:31,620 --> 01:29:33,975
Give me your ID.

1167
01:29:34,060 --> 01:29:37,416
Can't you see that I'm meaning?

1168
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:41,129
You weren't here either. Get out here!

1169
01:29:41,220 --> 01:29:45,532
I saw him raise a hand on the soldier.

1170
01:29:45,620 --> 01:29:49,977
- Get back!
- You maniac!

1171
01:29:50,060 --> 01:29:52,130
Get back!

1172
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:58,409
Leave him alone!

1173
01:29:58,500 --> 01:30:02,493
What are you doing?

1174
01:30:02,580 --> 01:30:06,698
Get back! Leave him alone!

1175
01:30:06,780 --> 01:30:09,772
Get back!

1176
01:30:09,860 --> 01:30:11,532
Stop it!

1177
01:30:11,620 --> 01:30:20,449
Leave him alone! Stop it!
