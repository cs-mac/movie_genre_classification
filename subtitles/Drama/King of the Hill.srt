"Six years ago,
on the morning of May 20, 1927,

3
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,431
I was fast asleep
when my bedside phone began to ring.

4
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,160
I looked at my alarm clock.
It was almost five.

5
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,039
I knew there was only one person
in the whole world

6
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,872
who would call at such an hour.

7
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,713
And when I picked up the phone,
I knew I was right.

8
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,077
'Hello,' I said. There was
quite a bit of noise on the line.

9
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,071
'Aaron, Charles Lindbergh here.

10
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,959
I'm calling from
Roosevelt Field on Long Island.

11
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,793
We're doing engine tests.'
'That's OK', I said.

12
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,474
'What can I do for you?'
'Well', he said,

13
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,837
'remember that flight
across the Atlantic?'

14
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,911
I told him I remembered.

15
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,277
He'd been telling me
and made me swear to keep it a secret.

16
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,510
'Here's the situation', Slim said.

17
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,878
'The fact is I'll be shoving off
in a few hours, around ten to eight.

18
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,157
I wanted to ask you about food.'
'Food?' I said.

19
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:42,279
'Yes', he replied. 'I anticipate
the flight to take about 34 hours,

20
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,477
and I wanted your opinion
on what kind of food to bring.'

21
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,757
'Well', I said, 'you can't
go wrong with a cheese sandwich.

22
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,912
And don't forget the mustard.'

23
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,559
He laughed.

24
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,757
'I knew I could count on you.
I'll cable you from Paris.'

25
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,559
'Good luck', I told him,
and hung up the phone.

26
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:04,430
Like everyone else, I listened
to the radio for news about his flight.

27
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,556
I wasn't worried about his safety.

28
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,792
I knew he had
a special lifeboat behind his seat,

29
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,518
in case of emergency.

30
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,277
But when the <i>Spirit of St Louis</i> landed
in Paris, 331/2 hours after take-off,

31
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,193
I yelled so loud the windows shook.

32
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,635
Two days later, I received a telegram.

33
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,076
It said, 'Sorry to disturb your sleep,

34
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,549
but it was good to hear your voice.

35
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,635

[Billy] "I chose John D Rockefeller
as my American hero

he has never forgotten
his humble beginnings.

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,072
Sullivan, see you soon, big boy. Huh?

157
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,629
Come on, Sull.

158
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,951
I don't wanna go!

159
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,954
Don't worry, OK?
I'm gonna earn money and get you back.

160
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,032
- How?
- Well, I'm not sure yet.

161
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,794
But I know Lester'll have some ideas.

162
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,270
Don't worry about Skippy.
I'll take good care of him.

163
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,997
See ya.

164
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,715
[Mom] All right, try me again.

165
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:16,396
True or false: Walter Emmins
had to go to the hospital because

166
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,632
he played with his belly button
so much it got infected.

167
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,711
- They had to operate.
- False.

168
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:25,316
It's true. He's gonna be
out of school for three weeks.

169
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,638
All right, one more.

170
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,159
True or false:

171
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,675
Today, after school,

172
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,877
I snuck into Sportsman's Park
through the bleachers,

173
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,431
and passed by the railing
and saw Pepper Martin going to third.

174
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,798
He saw me,
and threw me a piece of Wrigley's gum.

175
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,636
- True.
- False.

176
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,836
Gotcha.

177
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,116
Well, the trouble with this game

178
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,192
is I have to accept your word
for what's true or false.

179
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,717
- That's true.
- Hmm. [chuckles]

180
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,879
Good night.

181
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,430
[mother coughing]

182
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,152
[boy] You said you were gonna play,
you're gonna play.

183
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,709
- You ain't leavin' until you do.
- Not fair.

184
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,110
Put your marbles
on the ground, or else.

185
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,033
- I ain't got time to argue with you!
- You OK, Billy?

186
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,428
Scram, small fry.

187
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,831
This sissy said he'd shoot
for ten marbles. He's welshing.

188
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,151
- But their marbles are inferior.
- So's your old man.

189
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,471
I'll tell you what.
We'll shoot partners, us against you.

190
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,916
I'll put up five and Billy
will put up five against your ten.

191
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,432
- Sure.
- You bet.

192
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,795
All right, one, two, three, drop.

193
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,311
We'll let you go first.

194
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,471
Go ahead and shoot first, Billy.

195
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,232
OK.

196
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,233
[boy] Damn! How could you miss that?

197
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,158
Excuse me.

198
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,314
Pow!

199
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,475
Pow!

200
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,313
Wow!

201
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,991
Well, gentlemen, the game is over.

202
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,230
You were lucky.

203
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,275
- Sore losers.
- Yeah.

204
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,194
I never played marbles
before I came to Dewey.

205
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,713
No kidding.

206
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,519
Wanna come over
for a soda or something?

207
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,272
Yeah.

208
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:42,036
Oh, look, Billy. There's
that salesman I was telling you about.

209
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,714
- [Billy] Oh, yes.
- [woman] I don't understand.

210
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,077
Who would buy a candle
you can't even light?

211
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,153
[Billy] I was gonna change
into some playclothes.

212
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,311
- If you don't mind.
- [Aaron] Sure.

213
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,477
Criminy.

214
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,599
- This is signed by Pepper Martin?
- Yes. My father got it for me.

215
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,878
I never really used it, but maybe
it will be worth money someday.

216
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,996
Your father must be really nice.

217
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,754
Listen, Aaron,
how are you about birds?

218
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,673
I'm in favour of 'em.
I have a canary at home.

219
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,274
You have a canary? Me too!

220
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,671
How many birds did you say you have?

221
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,070
Well, you know, right now, just the one.

222
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,913
But he'll take a grape from my lips,

223
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,594
and fly to my finger
right when I put it out.

224
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,593
- That's nifty.
- Yeah. Why do you have so many?

225
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,716
I breed them. It's my hobby.

226
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,509
I sell them to Mr Farley
at the shop on Develavere.

227
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,194
You sell them? How much do you get?

228
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,670
- Three dollars a bird.
- Gosh!

229
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,355
Why don't you go into business?
I'll arrange it with Mr Farley.

230
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,512
- Yeah, but I only have Skippy.
- I'll give you a female.

231
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,797
Females aren't worth anything
because they don't sing.

232
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,758
Really? That's all I need?

233
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:35,038
Well, you need a breeding cage
like this one, but any big cage will do.

234
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,509
Then you need a few odds and ends.

235
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:41,434
Here, this is put out by the
Mr Finchbird Company. Tells everything.

236
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,719
- Here's a pretty sexy-looking dish.
- [chuckles]

237
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,990
Hey.

238
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,315
Are you sure you can't stay for dinner?

239
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,909
No, ma'am.

240
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,755
My mother's hosting a mah-jong
tournament, and wanted me to be there.

241
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,956
Hosting a tournament in your house?

242
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,350
Well...

243
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:19,431
...no. You see, we're living in a hotel
until our house is finished being built.

244
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,229
- The tournament is in the ballroom.
- What kind of house?

245
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,631
Just a regular house like this one.

246
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,076
And what does your father do, Aaron?

247
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,474
He flies airplanes.

248
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,393
- Wow!
- My, that's interesting.

249
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,869
So that's how
you know Charles Lindbergh.

250
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,078
Right.

251
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,869
[woman] So,
what kind of flying does he do?

252
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,598
Uh...

253
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:56,031
Well, it's sort of for the government.
And I'm not supposed to discuss it.

254
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,431
- Can't you tell us anything?
- You heard what Aaron said.

255
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,556
It's supposed to be secret.

256
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,918
I'm sure he prefer we didn't
breathe a word of it to anyone.

257
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,115
Isn't that right?

258
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,038
Yes, ma'am.

259
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,478
[Burns] I know you took it, I seen ya.
Now hand it over!

260
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,074
- I don't have no apples!
- I know you took it!

261
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,913
Give it here! Give it here!
Give it here!

262
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,957
- You ain't got no apple, huh?
- No!

263
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,078
Let me tell you something.
This is my street, my corner.

264
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,357
I know everything.
I catch you kiping apples one more time,

265
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,956
and I'll run your chicken ass in!
Now get out of here! Beat it!

Come on!

267
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,871
- What you got in there?
- A canary.

268
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:49,356
- Thought you had a canary.
- Yeah, I do. A male one.

269
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,669
This is a female.

270
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:54,037
I'm gonna breed canaries.
There's big money in canaries.

- What have you got?
- A canary.

275

I thought you already had a canary.

I do, but this one's a female.
I'm gonna breed canaries.

00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,791
We had a canary once.

278
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,918
Canaries are kinda nervous.
Don't you think?

279
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,911
I think I'd rather have a cat.

280
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,548
I'd name her Stephanie.

281
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:26,316
- What are you gonna name your bird?
- I have to... put her in her cage.

282
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,675
OK. See you later?

283
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,478
Yeah, OK. Sure.

- Hi.
- Hello.

286
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,598
- What have you got there?
- Billy Thompson gave me a canary.

287
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,230
- Aaron, we already have a canary.
- I know we have a canary.

288
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,038
This is a female.

289
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,239
Mr Farley at the pet store said he'd
give three dollars apiece for babies.

- Oh, my goodness. Are you sure?
- Yep.

291
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,631
And Billy said the average female
lays about four eggs,

292
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,995
so that's $12.

293
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,310
We can bring Sullivan home.

294
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,471
That would be wonderful.

You're not gonna play, brain.
You're gonna caddy.

311
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,396
I'm in good with the caddy master.
First couple of times,

312
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:39,155
you gotta split your fee.
It's still 50 cents to get you started.

313
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:43,074
- I could use 50 cents.
- Yep. You and all of Missouri.

314
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,435
You know any of the clubs?

315
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,990
- I know the putter.
- Stupendous. All right, easy.

316
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:52,436
You got your woods,
driver, brassie, spoon, cleek.

317
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:56,195
You got irons: 1-iron, mid-iron,
mid-mashie, mashie-iron,

318
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:59,875
spade mashie, mashie-niblick,
pitching niblick, regular.

325
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,229
Sure.

326
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,630
Aaron, it's been brought to my attention

327
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,475
that the address we have for you
in our records is no longer current.

328
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,471
Yes, that's because we moved.

329
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,039
Well...

330
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,919
...when you move,
you need to let the school know.

331
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,640
We might need to get in touch
with your parents.

332
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:58,873
If you've moved out of the district,
you might be going to the wrong school.

333
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,635
It is possible that you should
be going to Clark instead of Dewey.

334
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,872
I know, but we're still
in the same district, I'm sure.

335
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,952
Well, can you tell me
where you're living now?

336
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,918
Yeah. The Carleton Court apartments,

337
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,958
4519 Riley Street.

338
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,432
But if you're gonna send something
there, address it to Donald Miller.

339
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,672
- Donald Miller?
- Yeah.

340
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:28,148
My father works for the government,
and sometimes mail gets stolen.

341
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,880
We think it might be spies,
but we're not sure.

342
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:35,192
So if you put Donald Miller's name
on it, whoever's taking mail lets it go

343
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,193
because they won't know
it's really for my father.

344
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,836
I see.

345
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,353
- Donald Miller?
- Yeah.

346
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,796
It sounds complicated,
but it's the only way to make sure

347
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,632
that my father'll get it.

348

00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,556
Ella hasn't had one in a long time.

467
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,553
- Was it awful?
- Ella?

468
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,710
I think we should
let Aaron be on his way.

469
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,075
I just want to know
if I did anything bad.

00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,875
You were sick,
and now you're better.

471
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,550
It doesn't happen very often.

472
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,756
Just when we run out of medicine.

473
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,918
Well, I have to go back to my room.

474
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:42,039
- Will you come visit me again?
- Sure.

475
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,633
Promise?

476
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,358
Promise.

It's only a formality. I've got

You don't know
what kind of trouble you're in.

517
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,038
You told me your old man
parked his car in a parking lot.

518
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,589
What is that over there?
What do you call that?

Let me tell you something.
That's your father's.

I'm gonna give him a ticket
the size of Texas...

for Iowa, Kansas and Oklahoma.

What about Missouri?

Oh, don't you worry.
I've got it all arranged.

562
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,633
You see, most of the watches
are just display models.

563
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,712
They don't have works inside.
I took two that had works,

564
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:42,112
and I gave one to Manny at the Woodbine,
so that by the end of the day,

565
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:44,555
you walk in
and they give you a big dinner.

566
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,996
It won't be roast beef,
something healthy like liverwurst.

567
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:52,472
The other one I gave to Desot,
and he gave us $17 credit on our bill.

568
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:56,474
As long as we pay a little something,
they won't bother us.

569
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:01,998
And here is 25 cents for spending money.
There you go. Here.

But I have no choice.

all over the map.

- You know when you're gonna be back?
- I just can't tell.

580
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:44,199
But I'll be back as soon as I can
because I'll be very worried.

581
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,751
Is there anyplace I can write to you?

582
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:50,435
What happens if I need to get in touch
with you for something?

583
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,909
I guess there isn't.

00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:56,038
I'll be moving from town to town.

It's bad luck your mother
is sick just now.

586
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:01,513
I should put this off,
but you know how jobs are.

587
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,477
They're not gonna let you leave.

588
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:07,349
Desot said I could take a few things,
as long as I let them inspect it.

589
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,590
After all, I paid them $17.

590
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,797
Hey, walk me over to the car.

591
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,473
The car!

00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,150
Lucky for me, you boys saved the car.

593
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,788
Otherwise, I wouldn't
have been able to go.

594
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,278
Well, I'd drive you back,

595
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:34,671
but I can't let the repossessors see me.

596
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:50,116
Listen to me, Aaron.
You're going to be OK.

597
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,748
You're a smart boy.
You're very smart.

598
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,911
I tell you how smart you are.

599
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:58,675
When you were less than a year old,
your mother was in a sanatorium.

600
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:02,958
You would cry every night. The first few
times I picked you up, you stopped.

601
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:06,510
I realised you wanted attention.
So the next time you cried,

602
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:09,353
I got a glass of cold water
and stood over the crib

603
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:12,478
and said, "This is
a glass of cold water. Stop crying,

604
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:18,078
or you'll be sorry." You kept crying.
I poured the water, you stopped crying.

605
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:21,596
From then on,
when you cried, all I had to do

606
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,877
was to show you the glass of water
and you stopped crying.

607
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,838
That's a smart baby for you. Eh?

608
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:32,830

wanted to see my baby canaries

You've got five females.

Females don't sing,
so there's no market for them. Sorry.

They're not worth anything?
I can't bring them back.

777
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:06,994
- Were they at graduation?
- No, they weren't.

778
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:09,515
Are they away?

779
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:11,875
- Sort of.
- Where?

780
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:14,349
I can't really say.

781
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:17,717
You don't know where they are?
Don't they tell you?

782
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:20,997
Well, they're not able to... exactly.

783
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:23,754
But they could just call, couldn't they?

784
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:26,798
- Or write to you if they...
- They're missing.

785
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:29,235
They're missing?

786
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:31,914
- What do you mean?
- Well,

787
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:35,789
my parents are archaeologists,
and they were on an expedition

788
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:40,238
and nobody's heard from them in a while,
so I guess they're missing.

789
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:42,914
I'm sorry. I hope they're OK.

790
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:46,914
- Are people looking for them?
- Yeah. There's a search party.

791
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:50,117
I'm not that worried.
They've been lost lots of times.

792
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:52,077
Oh.

793
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:56,753
I need to sit down for a moment,
if you don't mind.

794
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:58,478
Sure.

795
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:08,673
[exhales deeply]

796
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:15,038
What's the matter?

797
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:18,909
Aaron just told me his parents
are missing on an expedition.

798
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:23,998
My grades were just as good.

799
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:27,197
Everyone knew they'd give
the award to the teacher's pet.

800
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:30,796
And all the girls feel sorry for him
'cause he's a charity case.

801
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:33,758
What a phoney.
And did you see that outfit?

802
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:37,230
I haven't seen clothes that funny
since the circus was here.

803
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:39,516
They don't even look like they're his.

804
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:42,638
My brother says there's
a poor kid like him every year.

805
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:44,995
They always gets special treatment.

806
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:54,597
[girl whispering] Did you hear about
Aaron's parents?

807
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:59,470
They're lost on an expedition.

808
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:01,792
[boy] Say, Aaron.

809
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:05,873
Walter Emmins said Betty Haskins
said that your parents were captured

810
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:07,871
by natives on a tiger hunt.

811
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:11,271
I thought your father was a pilot
flying for the government.

812
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:15,678
Excuse me.
I have to use your bathroom.

813
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:24,109
- Aaron!
- Aaron!

814
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:26,669
- Congratulations!
- Excuse me.

815
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:47,351
[grunts]

816
01:06:57,360 --> 01:07:01,273
- Did you graduate?
- Yeah.

817
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:07,148
- Got something for you.
- Really?

818
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:14,679
Someday, I'll teach you how to pop.

819
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:22,389
Thanks.

820
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:55,797
But my father said
he paid a $17 credit on our bill.

821
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:58,679
That's true.
But that leaves an unpaid balance

822
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:02,116
of $172.

823
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:04,840
The watch held the bank off
for a week or so,

824
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:08,549
- but now they're gonna take action.
- Three days, Mr Desot.

825
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:11,154
My father's in Kansas.
I don't know where.

826
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:14,630
I understand, but there's
nothing I can do about it.

827
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:17,712
I spent 25 years in this hotel,
started off as a clerk.

828
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:21,111
Now the bank gives the orders.

829
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:22,554
But you could call them

830
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:25,951
and tell them my father has a job
but he's travelling, right?

831
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:29,112
They simply don't care
what I have to say about this.

832
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:33,796
I don't have any power. They wanna
get rid of everyone on the third floor,

833
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:37,748
and just rent rooms to the dancehall
girls. That's where the money is.

834
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:41,877
All they care about is the money.

835
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:46,511
I'd suggest you contact your nearest
relative and see if they can't help.

836
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:48,591
I'm sorry.

837
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:08,598
Hey, Mom?

838
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:10,919
Mom?

839
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:15,157
Is Mrs Kurlander up there?

840
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:17,389
Aaron?

841
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:22,510
- Hi.
- I can't believe it's you.

842
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:26,873
I'm so glad to see you.

843
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:30,112
I miss you.

844
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:35,712
So? How are you?

845
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:43,517
Have you heard anything from Dad?

846
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:46,558
He sent me a postcard from Oklahoma.

847
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:49,749
He said the car broke down.

848
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:53,758
- Why, is everything all right?
- Yeah.

849
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:57,356
You know, everything's fine.
I was just wondering where he was.

850
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:01,595
When do you think you'll be coming home?

851
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:05,036
The doctor said the spot is closing
sooner than he expected.

852
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:07,156
When are they gonna let you out?

853
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:09,595
I don't know exactly.

854
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:11,512
But soon.

855
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:32,752
Hey, Mr Sandoz!

856
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:35,639
Mr Sandoz!

857
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:37,392
It's me, Aaron!

858
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:14,759
[Mungo] I think it's a misconception
that he's totally in love with himself.

859
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:18,469
After all, he did have a girlfriend.
Named Echo.

- I was wondering...
- Come in, come in.

866
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:37,555
You remember Lydia, don't you?

867
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:40,393
- Yeah.
- Put something on!

868
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:46,349
I have something on.
He doesn't mind, do you?

01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:48,715
- See, he likes it.

Where's the corn?

- I'm sorry, we're out of corn today.
- Jesus Christ.

875
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:10,514
- [Woodbine] Cash or credit?
- [Lydia scoffs]

876
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:12,871
I'll sign for it.

877
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:28,474
Perhaps you could spare
one or two bites for young Aaron.

878
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:30,278
Oh, no. Really, I couldn't.

879
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:34,069
When Aaron here works for his meal
the way I did, he can have some.

880
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:37,277
- That wouldn't be feasible.
- With you, who knows?

[clears throat]

882
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:45,078
The reason I came is... I wondered
if you'd buy my cigar band collection.

883
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:48,676
- Your cigar band collection?
- Yeah, you seemed interested.

884
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:52,469
I see, but why the sudden desire
to sell off this possession.

885
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:55,837
Well, I'm kind of low on money, so...

- They're trying to lock me out.
- Who?

888
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:04,159
- The bank that runs the hotel.
- I thought Mr Desot ran the hotel.

889
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:07,232
Well, Mr Desot told me
that if I didn't pay some money,

890
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:10,119
- the bank was gonna lock me out.
- I'll tell you what.

891
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:14,671
Come around tomorrow afternoon,
and we'll have a word with Mr Desot.

- I mean it, Aaron.

- Thank you.
- All right.

01:16:56,320 --> 01:17:00,029
- I'm gonna tell Mr Desot.
- How you gonna do that?

932
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:01,599
Homing pigeon?

933
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:05,036
- Mr Mungo's gonna talk to him.
- Mr Mungo?

934
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:08,715
He can't even get the Woodbine
to bring him food no more.

935
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:11,633
I'd say he's almost
as bad off as you are.

936
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:15,315
You're gonna have to
come out of there eventually.

937
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:20,873
Me, I'll just be out there in my chair,
eating three meals a day, till you do.

938
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:23,349
Unless you wanna surrender right now.

939
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:25,511
No!

940
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:27,796
I'll be seeing you.

941
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:30,235
[footsteps retreating]

942
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:52,949
Hello? Mr Mungo?

943
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:56,152
Hello?

944

01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:50,154
Thank you.

[Ben] How's it going in there?

[urinating]

954
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:58,832
[Aaron] Hello, Billy. Hello, Aaron.

955
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,878
How are you? I'm fine.

956
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:05,077
What did you have for lunch today?

957
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:08,312
- I had filet of sole.
- Oh.

958
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:11,071
What did you have?

959
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:13,151
I had a dinner roll.

960
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:15,038
And some water.

961
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:26,678
Yeah, ham.

962
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,036
Mmm...

963
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:18,676
[shivering]

964
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,118
Bastard.

[knock on door]

971
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:29,472
Uncle Nathan sent me
when he got Dad's letter.

[both sniffling]

- He killed himself?
- Mm-hmm.

974
01:25:55,680 --> 01:25:57,796
Right across the hall.

975
01:25:57,960 --> 01:25:59,359
Gee.

976
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:01,670
And the McShanes moved to Illinois.

977
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:03,990
Mr Sandoz is living in a Hooverville.

978
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:07,436
So you're the only person left?

979
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:09,750
Pretty much.

980
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:17,598
- I have to tell you something.
- What?

[farts]

982
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:25,990
[Aaron] Wait,
put your hand out a little.

983
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,319
Try it.

984
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:30,675
Good.
You kept your hand on the ground.

985
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:34,196
You gotta get your knuckles down.
You gotta twist your arm.

986

[marbles rolling]

987
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:38,436

Aaron!

990
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:48,037
Why do...? Why do...?

991
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:49,838
Sullivan?

992
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:53,788
- Dad!
- Sullivan, what are you doing here?

993
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:58,000
- What are you doing here?
- Uncle Nathan...

994
01:26:58,160 --> 01:26:59,559
It's a long story.

995
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:01,950
Oh, never mind. Tell me later.

996
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:04,270
Oh, it's so good to see you both.

997
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:06,715
I knew you could take care
of yourselves.

998
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:09,792
You know why I came home?
Because I got the WPA job.

999
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:12,997
- I'm a clerk, first-class.
- Great!

1000
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:15,628
You know what's great? It's the salary.

1001
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:18,872
Sixty-five dollars a month.

1002
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:20,792
- Sixty-five dollars!
- Yeah!

1003
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:23,110
Didn't I tell you not to worry?

1004
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:25,794
Let's not sit around.
Let's go get your mother,

1005
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:28,349
and see Donald
at the Carleton Apartments.

1006
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:31,432
- How about that?
- What about all our stuff?

1007
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:34,672
We buy new stuff.
After all, $65 a month.

1008
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:36,159
No!

1009
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:50,388
I'm not leaving my stuff here for Ben.

1010
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:52,630
But I've got it all arranged.

1011
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:55,155
Mom is waiting,
Donald Miller is waiting.

1012
01:27:55,320 --> 01:27:58,153
We could move
into the new apartment right away.

1013
01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:03,836
Aaron, the only way you could
take your things is if I pay the bill.

1014
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:07,470
And I'm not going to pay the bill, OK?

1015
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:11,470
Why is this so important to you?

1016
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:13,710
ltjust is.

1017
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:16,872
- We'll meet you at the Carleton Court.
- We?

1018
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:19,399
You're coming with me.

1019
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:24,431
I'm staying with Aaron.

1020
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:34,513
Well...

1021
01:28:34,680 --> 01:28:36,511
...l'm going.

1022
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:46,434
You'll never get your things past Ben.

1023
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:48,158
Never.

1024
01:28:54,280 --> 01:28:56,191
What are we gonna do?

1025
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:23,357
Back up! I'm gonna drop it.

1026
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:29,153
I'll get the suitcases,
you take the other stuff.

1027
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:30,958
OK!

1028
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:59,074
Who're you looking for there, slick?

1029
01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:02,915
None of your business.

Dressed awful warm, ain't ya?

1031
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:14,237
A friend of mine once said

1032
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:17,437
that you could teach a dog
to walk on its hind legs,

1033
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:19,238
but it's still a dog.

1034
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:33,316
[Burns] What did I tell ya?
Gimme that apple! Gimme that apple!

1035
01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:36,313
I'll put your ass into jail.
Gimme that apple!

1036
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:39,040
- Hey, Big Butt!
- Yeah?

1037
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:41,475
Better watch your step,
you big bohunk.

you're in, you little...

1042
01:32:00,120 --> 01:32:02,111
You little bastard!

1043
01:32:02,280 --> 01:32:03,269
Get out of here!

1044
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:06,868
You son of a bitch!

1045
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:08,553
You!

1046
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:02,877
I can let you boys stay in here
until your parents show up.

1047
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:06,157
Then I'll give the keys to your father.

1048
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:07,878
Oh, thanks.

1049
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:22,994
- What are these?
- Paints.

1050
01:33:23,160 --> 01:33:26,072
- We're gonna deliver them to Mr Sandoz.
- Oh, I get it.

1051
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:29,079
Can you hear me?

1052
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:30,832
Yes!

1053
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,195
Can you hear me?

1054

[Sullivan giggling]

1058
01:34:11,560 --> 01:34:13,869
- Aaron? Sullivan?
- Hello!

1059
01:34:14,040 --> 01:34:15,712
They're here!

1060
01:34:16,440 --> 01:34:18,510
- Hello!
- Mom!

1061
01:34:22,680 --> 01:34:23,669
Hi!

1062
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:28,869
- You've grown a bit.
- I think you're taller.

1063
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:33,678
[Sullivan] Mom,
there's a lot of stuff in here.

1064
01:34:45,200 --> 01:34:47,634
Don't you wanna say hello
to your mother?
