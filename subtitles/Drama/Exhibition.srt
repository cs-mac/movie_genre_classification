<i>The Museum of Contemporary
Art Tokyo, in Koto Ward.</i>

2
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:22,315
<i>During summer 2007,
an exhibition of work...</i>

3
00:00:22,556 --> 00:00:26,220
<i>...by Studio Ghibli's
"image artisan" took place here.</i>

4
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:36,027
<i>His works were framed
for the exhibit.</i>

5
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:40,498
<i>These works were originally
backgrounds and art boards...</i>

6
00:00:40,841 --> 00:00:43,776
<i>...used for scenes in
animated films.</i>

7
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:51,276
<i>No characters appeared
in these images.</i>

8
00:00:51,952 --> 00:00:56,253
<i>Only the background
for that scene was on display.</i>

9
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:18,203
<i>But each day the exhibition
was thronged with visitors.</i>

10
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:22,746
<i>All of them came to see
these "empty" backgrounds.</i>

11
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:26,750
<i>The exhibit ran for 66 days.</i>

12
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:33,818
<i>Over 200,000 people
saw Oga's work during that period.</i>

13
00:01:35,062 --> 00:01:37,895
<i>Visitors included people of all ages.</i>

14
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:43,560
<i>The museum staff
were amazed at the crowds.</i>

15
00:01:56,883 --> 00:02:02,788
<i>Most backgrounds are discarded
after production is finished.</i>

16
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:08,085
<i>But these works found their way to
an art museum, framed for display.</i>

17
00:02:17,204 --> 00:02:20,265
<i>The artist: Kazuo Oga.</i>

18
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:25,872
<i>Did he ever dream his work
would end up in a museum?</i>

19
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:31,107
It never occurred to me.

20
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:36,816
Animation backgrounds and cels
aren't meant to be preserved.

21
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:41,891
They're usually thrown away
after the film is complete.

22
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:49,959
<i>Animation background art
is discarded every day.</i>

23
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:57,034
<i>Background art is the stage
on which the characters interact.</i>

24
00:02:57,978 --> 00:03:03,576
<i>Background art was thought
to have little value in itself.</i>

25
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:08,087
<i>Among the works
on display here...</i>

26
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:12,258
<i>...were many that Oga
himself had saved.</i>

27
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:20,465
<i>Background art rarely survives.</i>

28
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:28,332
<i>But much of this art
captured the hearts of audiences.</i>

29
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:35,647
<i>Kazuo Oga was art director
for such Ghibli films...</i>

30
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,544
<i>...as "My Neighbor Totoro"
and "Only Yesterday".</i>

31
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:46,555
<i>Oga's background art evokes
feelings of nostalgia in audiences.</i>

32
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:54,332
<i>Now his backgrounds, which were
only part of the finished animation...</i>

33
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:59,631
<i>...are drawing attention
as artworks in themselves.</i>

34
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:17,655
<i>Oga works quietly
behind the scenes at Studio Ghibli...</i>

35
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:22,188
<i>...creating backgrounds
that move audiences.</i>

36
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:35,437
<i>Looking back on Oga's
single-minded dedication to his art...</i>

37
00:04:36,243 --> 00:04:40,908
<i>...we decided to call him
Ghibli's "image artisan".</i>

38
00:04:41,248 --> 00:04:44,240
KAZUO OGA GHIBLl'S IMAGE ARTISAN The
Artist Who Made Totoro's Forest

39
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:55,626
<i>1972. Kazuo Oga was 20.</i>

40
00:04:55,962 --> 00:05:00,866
<i>One day he saw a job listing
for "people who like to draw".</i>

41
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,834
<i>And so he joined
Kobayashi Production.</i>

42
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:09,031
<i>It was a company specializing
in animation backgrounds.</i>

43
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:12,568
<i>It was here
that Oga discovered...</i>

44
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:16,772
<i>...the profession of
background artist.</i>

45
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:24,656
<i>At that stage, Oga actually
had almost no training in art.</i>

46
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:25,489
"THE ADVENTURE OF GAMBA"

47
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:29,861
<i>He learned the techniques
as he went along.</i>

48
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:31,297
"THE CHAMPION"

49
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:35,235
It turned out that
the paper for backgrounds...

50
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:40,701
...was about the size of
the sketch pads I used in school.

51
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:46,669
I was doing backgrounds
day after day.

52
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:49,680
I felt pretty lucky.

53
00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:57,485
<i>This is a background from
”The Giatrus, The First Man”.</i>

54
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,752
<i>Art director Shichiro Kobayashi...</i>

55
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:06,095
<i>...designed daringly abstract,
abbreviated backgrounds for the series.</i>

56
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:10,970
<i>The style differs completely
from Oga's recent work.</i>

57
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:17,872
<i>Shichiro Kobayashi is the founder
of Kobayashi Production...</i>

58
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,840
<i>...where Oga started out.</i>

59
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:23,041
<i>Oga regards Kobayashi
as his mentor.</i>

60
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,717
<i>What was his
first impression of Oga?</i>

61
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:35,394
SHICHIRO KOBAYASHI
KOBAYASHI PRODUCTION

62
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:38,956
I suspected he had
potential, that's all.

63
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:44,829
He had a delicate sensibility.

64
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:52,142
It was reflected in the way
he handled straight lines.

65
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:56,749
That stood out
at the time.

66
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:05,417
Not good for much at first,
but I sensed he had huge potential.

67
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:09,590
But he was extremely sensitive.

68
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:16,699
<i>In those days, the company
was very busy with TV animation work.</i>

69
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:20,362
<i>Oga was exposed to
a wide range of techniques.</i>

70
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:32,842
I had to minimize detail
to complete my work quickly.

71
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:38,717
I also learned which things
to emphasize, to minimize detail.

72
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:42,625
The goal is to get the essential
point across effectively.

73
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:46,055
No need to detail
what people will overlook.

74
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:49,559
"THE CHAMPION"
BACKGROUND ART

75
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:54,607
I learned a great deal about
how to eliminate unneeded details.

76
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:58,174
Oga delivered everything
I asked, and more.

77
00:07:58,278 --> 00:08:05,344
The backgrounds he produced
were extremely tidy.

78
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:10,756
His work had
a consistently abstract touch.

79
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:17,887
His approach to images
was efficient and skilled.

80
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:26,038
"HARMAGEDON"
BACKGROUND

81
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:30,601
<i>Art director Takamura Mukuo
invited him to work on "Harmagedon".</i>

82
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:38,677
<i>Oga supplied backgrounds
for several key scenes in the film.</i>

83
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:43,318
<i>He also supplied promotional
artwork for the movie poster.</i>

<i>...and further developed his skills
as a background artist.</i>

87
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:25,627
<i>Boundless blue sky,
white snow.</i>

88
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:33,236
<i>Mighty boulders,
crimson flowers.</i>

89
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:40,579
<i>These backgrounds reflect
Oga's keen powers of observation.</i>

90
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:46,117
<i>They are glimpses of
his future direction.</i>

91
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:50,320
<i>"Barefoot Gen".</i>

92
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:54,559
<i>Oga has accumulated
a decade of experience.</i>

93
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:59,460
<i>Now he will serve as art director
on an animated feature.</i>

94
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:06,365
<i>Oga made numerous trips
to Hiroshima to scout locations...</i>

95
00:10:06,506 --> 00:10:11,945
<i>...and used photographs of prewar
Hiroshima to create his backgrounds.</i>

96
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:17,979
<i>But later, a friend who knew
prewar Hiroshima saw the film...</i>

97
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:23,084
<i>...and told Oga that his
backgrounds were not accurate.</i>

98
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:29,895
I visited Hiroshima and used
photographs of the old buildings...

99
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,098
...as reference
for my backgrounds.

100
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:36,362
The material I had assembled
turned out to be weak.

101
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:43,203
Looking back, I realize that
I should have made more effort...

102
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:49,641
...to consult people who had
clear memories of the prewar city.

103
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:57,146
<i>"Time Stranger" was an animated version
of Taku Mayumura's SF novel.</i>

104
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:03,096
<i>It tells the story of
a boy from the future...</i>

105
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:07,257
<i>...and the teenagers who join
his adventures through time.</i>

106
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:13,533
<i>The story spans
past, present and future.</i>

107
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:19,303
<i>The characters experience
World War II...</i>

108
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:24,677
<i>...the era of the Shogun,
and Japan's ancient civil wars.</i>

109
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:39,489
<i>Oga's many detailed environments
brought the past to life.</i>

110
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:55,680
I thought the backgrounds
would go more smoothly...

111
00:11:55,882 --> 00:12:00,342
...if I worked out
the settings thoroughly first.

112
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,379
I created a lot of images
that weren't needed.

113
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,322
But I had a lot of fun.

114
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:14,801
<i>As art director, Oga created
detailed environments...</i>

115
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:20,338
<i>...based on extensive research
and consultations with experts.</i>

116
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:30,848
<i>In the course of his work,
he worked with many directors...</i>

117
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:34,818
<i>...on a diverse range of
background art styles.</i>

118
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:39,685
<i>During this period, Oga worked on
animated television series...</i>

119
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:42,224
<i>...and many
short-turnaround features.</i>

<i>Permission to display

<i>...was readily granted by the

"MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO" (1988)

128
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:30,940
<i>...was Hayao Miyazaki's
"My Neighbor Totoro".</i>

129
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:40,441
<i>The place: the countryside
outside Tokyo, in the late '50s.</i>

130
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:47,358
<i>An unpaved road
winds through rice paddies.</i>

131
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:52,429
<i>Scenes like this were once
common just outside the city.</i>

132

<i>An art director for "Totoro"
was urgently needed.</i>

135
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:22,258
<i>One day Oga received a call
from director Hayao Miyazaki.</i>

136
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:25,362
Miyazaki had
a close relationship...

TOSHIO SUZUKI
PRODUCER

138

<i>...with an art director
named Nizo Yamamoto.</i>

139
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:34,997
That's how Miyazaki
heard about Kazuo Oga.

140
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,370
Miyazaki assumed
Oga would be suitable.

141
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,938
Miyazaki has this
interesting trait.

142
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:43,647
You see,
if Miyazaki trusts you...

143
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:47,786
...he assumes
he can trust your friend.

<i>So Oga joined the

146

<i>Oga vividly recalls one of
his early exchanges with Miyazaki.</i>

147
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:10,776
Once the storyboard was done,
I set to work on the backgrounds.

148
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:19,350
Miyazaki didn't present me
with any difficult requirements.

149
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:25,823
So I assembled and checked a set of
backgrounds for him to look at.

150
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:30,223
I think it was his first look
at the backgrounds.

151
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:35,997
His reaction was,
"So this is the best you can do?"

152
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:39,935
He wasn't really upset.

153
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:44,736
But for me,
it was quite a shock.

154
00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:53,948
<i>Miyazaki asked Oga to pay
close attention to rural landscapes.</i>

155
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:57,446
<i>To grasses, trees and flowers.</i>

158
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:07,231
<i>Oga had received
such guidance from a director.</i>

159
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:17,101
I decided to go back
and redo everything myself.

160
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:22,976
After that I checked
all the backgrounds very closely.

161
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:30,456
<i>Oga worked hard to capture
every type of foliage...</i>

162
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:36,185
<i>...and the changing face of
the landscape throughout the day.</i>

163
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:41,657
<i>The result was something
rarely seen before in animation.</i>

164
00:16:45,972 --> 00:16:48,373
<i>A clear summer sky.</i>

165
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:53,669
<i>An acorn, through a hole
in a bucket.</i>

166
00:16:56,716 --> 00:17:01,347
<i>The changing faces of clouds,
moment to moment.</i>

167
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:27,236
<i>The house where sisters Satsuki
and Mei and their father will live.</i>

168
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:39,317
<i>The house combines
Japanese and Western elements.</i>

169
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:46,131
<i>This style of architecture
was actually popular at the time.</i>

170

BACKGROUND
(WITH KIYOMI OTA)

171
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:06,308
<i>The earthen-floored kitchen.</i>

172
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:25,765
<i>There is no plumbing.
Water is drawn from a well.</i>

173
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:43,381
<i>Father's library, in
the Western room of the house.</i>

174
00:18:56,669 --> 00:19:01,129
<i>The wood-fired bath,
heated from below.</i>

175
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:13,141
<i>Everything is bathed in
warm light from the kitchen.</i>

176
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:18,052
<i>The scene is empty, but the image
immediately brings to mind...</i>

177
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:21,954
<i>...z'he father and
his daughters taking a bath.</i>

178
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:27,693
<i>The veranda, open
to the outdoors.</i>

179
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:32,162
<i>One can almost feel
the refreshing breeze...</i>

180
00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:34,703
<i>...of a summer afternoon.</i>

181
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:38,841
<i>Someone from the neighborhood
could drop by anytime.</i>

182
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:43,781
<i>These unlocked doors are
a link to another time.</i>

183
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:51,782
<i>Oga based his realistic rendering
on the house of a relative...</i>

184
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:54,723
<i>...in rural Gunma Prefecture.</i>

185
00:19:55,261 --> 00:20:00,665
<i>Oga thought the house matched
Miyazaki's storyboard concept.</i>

186
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:04,867
<i>He had his relative send
photos of the house.</i>

187
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:09,203
<i>The way upstairs
is steep and dark.</i>

188
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:13,872
<i>It looks like the gateway
to another dimension.</i>

189
00:20:21,854 --> 00:20:27,122
<i>Near the house stands
a huge camphor tree.</i>

190
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:39,839
<i>It almost seems supernatural.</i>

191
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:42,766
<i>This is Totoro's home.</i>

192
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,583
<i>And here's the entrance.</i>

193
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:18,409
<i>Inside, the floor is carpeted
with grass and flowers.</i>

194
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,748
<i>Everything is finely detailed.</i>

195
00:21:26,352 --> 00:21:30,687
<i>Oga made the floor
soft and spongy...</i>

196
00:21:30,823 --> 00:21:35,488
<i>...so Mei would not
hurt herself as she falls in.</i>

197
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,911
<i>Nature's face changes
with each change in the light.</i>

198
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:02,944
<i>Depending on the weather
and time of day...</i>

199
00:22:03,189 --> 00:22:06,250
<i>...the same place can take on
a completely different appearance.</i>

200
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:10,855
<i>Oga brilliantly depicts these
changes in mood.</i>

201
00:22:28,147 --> 00:22:30,673
<i>A late afternoon shower.</i>

202
00:22:37,623 --> 00:22:41,389
<i>The bright scenery
is transformed.</i>

203
00:22:50,236 --> 00:22:55,868
<i>When the rain stops,
the once-sunlit landscape...</i>

204
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,436
<i>...becomes a world
of shadows.</i>

205
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:24,799
<i>This background is for a
memorable scene in "Totoro".</i>

206
00:23:25,037 --> 00:23:30,407
<i>Here, the sisters encounter
Totoro and the Cat Bus.</i>

207
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:50,755
<i>Later that evening,
the sky is full of stars.</i>

208
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:04,774
<i>You can almost hear
the crickets in the distance.</i>

209
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:13,478
<i>The most' notable
"To taro " backgrounds...</i>

210
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:17,451
<i>...depict nature's
transformation as night falls.</i>

211
00:24:23,729 --> 00:24:28,098
The aspect of "Totoro"
that impressed me most...

212
00:24:29,101 --> 00:24:33,299
...is the sequence where
Satsuki goes looking for Mei.

213
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:37,774
The backgrounds convey
the passage of time.

214
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:42,473
Without Oga, I doubt that
sequence would have worked.

215
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:45,946
Mei!

216
00:24:48,354 --> 00:24:52,154
<i>Naoya Tanaka is an
art director at Studio Ghibli.</i>

217
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:57,161
<i>Here is his perspective
on Oga's backgrounds.</i>

218
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:02,497
It's as if Oga has
a kind of special filter...

219
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:06,836
NAOYA TANAKA

220
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,136
It's not a naturalistic effect.

221
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,599
He extracts the essence of
important elements of the scene.

222
00:25:13,312 --> 00:25:18,216
Then he augments them
to enrich the image.

223
00:25:18,317 --> 00:25:21,548
Oga is very adept at this.

224
00:25:21,787 --> 00:25:27,521
What this does is change
the landscape from something familiar...

225
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:32,730
...to something that
feels more like déjé vu.

226
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:36,596
The audience shares the experience
with the character.

227
00:25:44,777 --> 00:25:48,771
<i>A landscape already
stored in the mind.</i>

228
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:53,013
<i>The audience feels a
mysterious nostalgia.</i>

229
00:25:56,622 --> 00:25:59,023
<i>After "My Neighbor Totoro"...</i>

230
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:04,162
<i>...Oga becomes an indispensible
part of Studio Ghibli.</i>

231
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:21,173
<i>So what is animation
background art all about?</i>

232
00:26:29,288 --> 00:26:33,691
<i>In the production process,
characters drawn by the animators...</i>

233
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:38,329
<i>...are moved frame by frame
against a background.</i>

234
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:44,233
<i>Before the advent of automated tools,
characters were hand drawn...</i>

235
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:47,601
<i>...on transparent
acrylic sheets called cels.</i>

236
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:54,812
PRODUCTION PHOTOGRAPHY

237
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:59,410
<i>...of cel and background,
photographed with special techniques.</i>

238
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:07,284
<i>Take this vertical background.</i>

239
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:16,361
<i>Can you guess
which scene this is from?</i>

240
00:27:19,505 --> 00:27:22,338
This technique is called
"pan with action".

241
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:25,937
<i>Ashitaka gallops down the cliff
in "Princess Mononoke".</i>

242
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:32,850
<i>For the completed sequence,
foreground leaves are superimposed...</i>

243
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:37,354
<i>...and moved a few millimeters
in each frame.</i>

244
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:48,064
<i>It's over in four seconds.</i>

245
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:55,637
<i>Sliding overlays is another
specialized technique.</i>

246
00:27:55,807 --> 00:28:00,608
<i>Five separate background cels
with different perspectives...</i>

247
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:04,239
<i>...are superimposed over
a background base.</i>

248
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:07,944
<i>The cels are separated
for the exhibit.</i>

249
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:11,785
<i>But during photography
they are in contact.</i>

250
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:18,430
<i>Character cels and background overlays
move at different speeds.</i>

251
00:28:18,764 --> 00:28:21,096
<i>This is the completed sequence.</i>

252
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,896
Quiet your rage,
I beg you!

253
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,364
<i>A mere three seconds!</i>

254
00:28:27,506 --> 00:28:32,376
<i>A tremendous amount of effort
for only three seconds of action.</i>

255
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:41,782
<i>A panoramic background
from "Kiki's Delivery Service".</i>

256
00:28:41,987 --> 00:28:45,116
<i>In this "follow and pan" shot,
the characters move...</i>

257
00:28:45,357 --> 00:28:50,557
<i>...across the field of view
and into the distance.</i>

258
00:29:03,709 --> 00:29:08,943
<i>In e live action film, the camera
just' follows the action.</i>

259
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:14,884
<i>For animation, a correspondingly
long background is necessary.</i>

260
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:32,228
<i>Some panoramic backgrounds
are quite specialized.</i>

261
00:29:32,671 --> 00:29:36,198
<i>This background
from "Only Yesterday"...</i>

262

<i>muses e technique
celled "track up and pen”.</i>

263
00:29:43,849 --> 00:29:48,787
<i>As adult Taeko turns,
the camera pans left.</i>

264
00:29:49,755 --> 00:29:53,316
<i>The camera points
to a scene from the past.</i>

265
00:29:56,061 --> 00:30:01,693
<i>The background is drawn
to simulate a wide-angle shot.</i>

266
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,833
<i>With some simple
camera work...</i>

267
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:08,395
<i>...we jump from
present to past.</i>

268
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:15,645
<i>We can see the distortions
used to achieve this effect...</i>

269
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:18,409
<i>...when we view
the entire background.</i>

270
00:30:18,517 --> 00:30:20,884
<i>These distortions
are carefully calculated...</i>

271
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:25,852
<i>...so the result will appear natural
as the camera moves.</i>

272
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:31,394
Didn't you promise to ask only

<i>Cels and backgrounds
are composited digitally.</i>

277
00:30:54,553 --> 00:30:59,889
<i>But backgrounds are
still produced the same way.</i>

...the look of their work differs
depending on where they come from.

297
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:03,538
The quality of
the air is different.

298
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:08,577
Artists from northern Japan
render air very transparently.

299
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:13,924
With artists from the south,
the air seems mistier.

300
00:33:14,059 --> 00:33:19,691
This probably comes from
their childhood environment.

301
00:33:19,865 --> 00:33:24,462
Takahata is actually from
Mie Prefecture...

302
00:33:24,636 --> 00:33:29,574
...which is more toward
the south of the country.

303
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:35,010
But the truth is, he actually
prefers northern Japan.

304
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:39,477
So he probably likes the
style of northern artists.

305
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:44,385
When Takahata saw "Totoro"
he was very impressed.

306
00:33:44,623 --> 00:33:48,685
So when he began preparing
for "Only Yesterday"...

307
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:51,854
...he wanted Oga
as his art director.

308
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:56,190
<i>"Only Yesterday"
is based on a serial comic.</i>

309
00:33:56,635 --> 00:33:59,798
<i>It tells the story
of little Taeko...</i>

310
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:04,532
<i>mend her experiences
as a child in the late 7.960s.</i>

311
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:05,510
TAEKO (AGE 10)

312
00:34:07,012 --> 00:34:12,473
<i>Takahata created a story
about Taeko as an adult...</i>

313
00:34:12,584 --> 00:34:16,248
<i>...combined with
flashbacks from her past.</i>

314
00:34:16,955 --> 00:34:22,018
TAEKO (AGE 27)

315
00:34:22,027 --> 00:34:23,290
<i>...Taeko feels drawn
to rural Japan.</i>

316
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:28,526
<i>So she goes to visit relatives
in Yamagata Prefecture.</i>

317
00:34:28,867 --> 00:34:33,532
<i>Why did Takahata choose
this location for his story?</i>

318
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:37,873
Oga is actually
a native of Akita.

319
00:34:38,043 --> 00:34:44,608
So Takahata wanted
to use Akita as the setting.

320
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:50,586
But to drive the story, we needed
to find a special local product.

321
00:34:50,689 --> 00:34:55,525
Something distinctive
that would work for animation.

322
00:34:56,561 --> 00:35:01,897
We did a lot of research
and discovered Yamagata's safflowers.

323
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:06,033
Akita didn't have
anything to rival that.

324
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:09,139
So Takahata set
the story in Yamagata.

325
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:15,046
<i>"Only Yesterday" features flashbacks
with pale, simple backgrounds...</i>

326
00:35:15,347 --> 00:35:19,147
<i>...and scenes of today's Yamagata
with rich, detailed backgrounds.</i>

327
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:22,443
<i>The contrast alternates
throughout the film.</i>

328
00:35:25,156 --> 00:35:27,124
<i>Taeko's childhood.</i>

329
00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:32,491
<i>The backgrounds are
somewhat indistinct...</i>

330
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:35,657
<i>...like nostalgic images
stored deep in the memory.</i>

331
00:35:37,936 --> 00:35:42,965
<i>Takahata wanted to emphasize a
feeling of the distance of memory.</i>

332
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:47,472
<i>So Oga's backgrounds were
rendered in pale colors.</i>

333
00:36:01,693 --> 00:36:07,462
<i>The simple lines and pale colors
of distant memories.</i>

334
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:11,492
<i>Unnecessary detail
was to be omitted.</i>

335
00:36:11,703 --> 00:36:15,970
<i>Only the content of memory
would be depicted.</i>

336
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:20,770
<i>Anything not recalled
clearly would not be depicted.</i>

337
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:25,983
<i>The flashback scenes were created
according to this artistic vision.</i>

338
00:36:32,891 --> 00:36:35,519
<i>Backgrounds for the film's
present-day scenes...</i>

339
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,526
<i>...are in complete contrast
to the pale colors of memory.</i>

340
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:48,939
<i>Based on careful research,
these backgrounds are highly detailed.</i>

341
00:36:55,180 --> 00:37:02,644
LOCATION SCOUTING (1990)

342
00:37:02,654 --> 00:37:03,416
<i>...for firsthand experience
in safflower harvesting.</i>

343
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:09,554
<i>Everyone on the
production team went along.</i>

344
00:37:13,031 --> 00:37:16,899
<i>Visiting the actual scene
of the story is essential.</i>

345
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:19,966
<i>So much to see
and experience.</i>

346
00:37:20,105 --> 00:37:24,372
<i>The lessons learned have a
major influence on the film.</i>

347
00:37:27,112 --> 00:37:31,049
Photographs alone can't convey
the atmosphere or the scale.

348
00:37:31,783 --> 00:37:37,722
When you actually go, you see
the way mist rises from the valleys.

349
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:43,556
You have to see the way
the mist looks with your own eyes.

350
00:37:43,695 --> 00:37:46,926
Later you can use
what you've seen...

351
00:37:47,165 --> 00:37:50,829
...as a point of departure
for your creativity.

352
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:57,340
With photos, you can't judge
how conditions change through time.

353
00:37:59,144 --> 00:38:04,605
<i>The staff boarded the same night train
Taeko uses on her journey.</i>

354
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:09,616
<i>They left late at night
and arrived early next morning.</i>

355
00:38:10,555 --> 00:38:14,514
<i>This background
approaches photorealism.</i>

356
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:18,493
<i>It also brings the period
vividly to life.</i>

357
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:42,115
<i>Background artist Yoji Takeshige
also visited locations in Yamagata.</i>

358
00:38:42,453 --> 00:38:45,582
<i>He speaks about
the role of location visits.</i>

359
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:52,586
Actually visiting the locale
helps us do a better job...

360
00:38:52,597 --> 00:38:53,723
<i>'(OM TAKESPHGE</i>

361
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:57,668
...in conveying the
atmosphere to audiences.

362
00:38:57,902 --> 00:39:02,601
Much more so
than with photographs alone.

363
00:39:04,876 --> 00:39:08,244
You have to
see it first hand.

364
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:12,541
The quiet of an
early morning train platform.

365
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:19,684
The look of a car driving along
an empty road before dawn.

366
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:26,529
The silence, the chill
of dew in the morning.

367
00:39:27,966 --> 00:39:30,628
The warmth
of the sun's rays...

368
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:34,396
...as it rises over
a field of safflowers.

369
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:39,408
You have to actually
experience these things.

370
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:41,569
Then what you create...

371
00:39:41,813 --> 00:39:46,375
...will more effectively convey
an impression to the audience.

372
00:39:50,188 --> 00:39:55,718
<i>Like Taeko, the production staff
began picking flowers before dawn.</i>

373
00:39:56,461 --> 00:40:00,523
<i>The thorns of the safflower
are softest in the morning.</i>

374
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:04,032
<i>That's why safflowers
are harvested early.</i>

375
00:40:04,135 --> 00:40:08,003
<i>The lessons learned
from actual participation...</i>

376
00:40:08,106 --> 00:40:12,065
<i>...make for more
convincing backgrounds.</i>

377
00:40:40,505 --> 00:40:44,772
<i>The sun rises over
a majestic field of safflowers.</i>

378
00:40:46,144 --> 00:40:49,512
<i>You can almost
feel the scene physically.</i>

379
00:41:00,425 --> 00:41:05,295
<i>"Only Yesterday" used a number
of animation techniques...</i>

380
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:08,263
<i>...that had hardly
been seen before.</i>

381
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:12,063
<i>For example,
realistic physical movement...</i>

382
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:16,073
<i>...and natural wrinkles
in the faces of characters.</i>

383
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:20,175
<i>What impact did this
detailed character animation...</i>

384
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:22,607
<i>...have on the backgrounds?</i>

385
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:26,881
I didn't consciously plan to make
the backgrounds very detailed.

386
00:41:27,385 --> 00:41:30,821
But I think I ended up
being swept along...

387
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:32,580
...by the animation.

388
00:41:40,398 --> 00:41:44,699
<i>Realistic backgrounds
for realistic characters.</i>

389
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:49,464
<i>The result was minutely
detailed background art.</i>

390
00:41:49,574 --> 00:41:53,306
<i>But Oga learned something
from this experience.</i>

391
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:59,911
I thought the backgrounds
were simply too detailed.

392
00:42:00,051 --> 00:42:04,648
This was a lesson
I've never forgotten.

393
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:11,057
I don't think it was necessary
to include that much detail.

394
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:16,393
The backgrounds
could have been simpler.

395
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:24,340
<i>"Only Yesterday" featured extremely
detailed backgrounds.</i>

396
00:42:25,276 --> 00:42:28,940
<i>They garnered praise
when the film was released.</i>

397
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:35,547
<i>But Oga himself came
to a different conclusion.</i>

398
00:42:36,421 --> 00:42:40,824
<i>The lesson he learned was -
do your research thoroughly.</i>

399
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:45,227
<i>Once you know what
you are doing, you can omit detail.</i>

400
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:52,096
<i>The result will be environments
that audiences find appealing.</i>

401
00:42:53,304 --> 00:42:58,902
<i>In other words,
less is more.</i>

402
00:43:11,389 --> 00:43:16,452
<i>Before and after "Only Yesterday",
Oga worked on background art...</i>

403
00:43:16,461 --> 00:43:19,897
"KIKl'S DELIVERY SERVICE" (1989)
"PORCO ROSSO" (1992)

404
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:28,196
<i>With its European settings
of stone and brick...</i>

405
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:32,936
<i>..."Kiki's Delivery Service" was
completely different from "Totoro".</i>

406
00:43:36,814 --> 00:43:42,184
A former colleague of mine
from Kobayashi Production...

407
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:45,278
...was the art director
on this film.

408
00:43:46,524 --> 00:43:50,893
I really put
a lot of work into it.

409
00:43:54,432 --> 00:43:57,925
But the chance to participate
in the production...

410
00:43:58,169 --> 00:44:00,797
...was very good
for me too.

411
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:05,503
<i>Oga's work in
"Kiki's Delivery Service"...</i>

412
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:09,371
<i>...naturally focused on scenes
filled with flowers and trees.</i>

413
00:44:10,348 --> 00:44:14,945
<i>Miyazaki supplied the concept,
but when Oga was finished...</i>

414
00:44:15,186 --> 00:44:19,919
<i>...Kiki's house was surrounded
with lush greenery.</i>

415
00:44:32,937 --> 00:44:36,931
<i>"Porco Rosso" was also
set in Europe.</i>

416
00:44:37,575 --> 00:44:42,137
<i>Oga says he was not
originally slated to work on this film.</i>

417
00:44:42,547 --> 00:44:45,482
<i>But he decided
to join the project...</i>

418
00:44:45,716 --> 00:44:50,483
<i>...when he heard his friend
Katsu Hisamura would be art director.</i>

419
00:44:51,956 --> 00:44:56,826
<i>Once again, Oga handled many
scenes featuring natural beauty.</i>

420
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:03,596
<i>To depict the beauty
of the Adriatic...</i>

421
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:08,430
<i>...Oga imbued sea and sky
with rich, deep color.</i>

422
00:45:13,744 --> 00:45:17,374
<i>Porco Rosso's hideout.</i>

423
00:45:18,149 --> 00:45:23,519
<i>Steep cliff, ocean inlet
and blue sky contrast sharply.</i>

424
00:45:41,439 --> 00:45:44,807
<i>Chanteuse Gina's secret garden.</i>

425
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:48,938
<i>Beyond the beautiful foliage
spreads the blue Adriatic.</i>

426
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:52,946
<i>Again, contrast is the key
to this background.</i>

427
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:09,932
<i>Oga's next project
was "Pom Poko".</i>

428
00:46:10,334 --> 00:46:14,237
<i>The setting for director
Isao Takahata's film...</i>

429
00:46:14,238 --> 00:46:16,639
"POM POKO" (1994)

430
00:46:16,641 --> 00:46:19,110
<i>...was the rural Tama Hills
district, near Tokyo.</i>

431
00:46:23,114 --> 00:46:26,982
<i>Drawing on his experience
with "Only Yesterday"...</i>

432
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:32,249
<i>...Oga decided not to make
the backgrounds too detailed.</i>

433
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:45,503
I created the backgrounds
for "Pom Poko"...

434
00:46:45,736 --> 00:46:54,008
...based on what I felt was
the right level of detail for the film.

435
00:46:54,912 --> 00:47:00,908
I didn't work on
the basis of what to omit.

436
00:47:01,719 --> 00:47:07,249
I was familiar with the
natural environment of Tama.

437
00:47:07,625 --> 00:47:12,620
I had a sense of
the foliage and the scenery.

438
00:47:12,797 --> 00:47:16,665
I simply created backgrounds
with the level of detail...

439
00:47:16,901 --> 00:47:19,893
...that seemed appropriate
to convey the settings.

440
00:47:21,906 --> 00:47:26,867
<i>In fact, Oga had already moved
to Hachioji City in the Tama area.</i>

441
00:47:27,278 --> 00:47:32,307
<i>This was in 1987,
during production of "Totoro".</i>

442
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:40,886
<i>Oga was excited that
the area where he lived...</i>

443
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:44,052
<i>...had become the setting
for an animated film.</i>

444
00:47:44,628 --> 00:47:47,120
<i>He drew on
first-hand experience...</i>

445
00:47:47,365 --> 00:47:51,962
<i>...to depict the loss of forests
and mountains to development.</i>

446
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:55,804
<i>Along the way, he portrayed
the changing seasons...</i>

447
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:59,408
<i>...with an accuracy
seldom seen in animation.</i>

448
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:12,648
We wanted to show the lives
of raccoons in detail.

449
00:48:12,957 --> 00:48:19,420
So we had to show how
the raccoons lived in each season.

450
00:48:19,597 --> 00:48:21,292
That was the goal.

451
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:26,435
Working on the backgrounds
for "Pom Poko" was a lot of fun.

452
00:48:28,139 --> 00:48:30,733
<i>A construction site
on New Year's Day.</i>

453
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:34,071
<i>A power shovel
stands deserted.</i>

454
00:48:34,178 --> 00:48:39,514
<i>Through the sparkling air,
snowy Mt. Fuji rises in the distance.</i>

455
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:43,918
<i>This background is like
a modern woodblock print.</i>

456
00:48:46,824 --> 00:48:51,057
<i>Naoya Tanaka recalls an anecdote
behind this snowy scene.</i>

457
00:48:53,264 --> 00:48:58,498
One day during production,
there was a rare, heavy snowfall.

458
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:03,737
It was still early, but Oga said
he was leaving to scout locations.

459
00:49:04,308 --> 00:49:07,801
He left everyone else
slaving away.

460
00:49:08,078 --> 00:49:13,312
He said it was a great chance
to get a feel for the snow.

461
00:49:13,584 --> 00:49:16,610
To be honest,
I didn't do any research.

462
00:49:16,754 --> 00:49:21,817
I just wanted to play
in the snow, so I left early.

463
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:28,965
But you know,
it's always good to get out...

464
00:49:29,166 --> 00:49:34,229
...and actually experience
unusual weather conditions.

465
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:49,719
<i>The changing face of the Tama Hills
throughout the season.</i>

466
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:53,715
<i>Natural environments
destroyed by development.</i>

467
00:49:54,992 --> 00:50:00,396
<i>Photographs leave a record,
but there is much they cannot capture.</i>

468
00:50:01,465 --> 00:50:04,867
<i>The smell of a breeze.</i>

469
00:50:05,236 --> 00:50:08,797
<i>And the nostalgia
that is "memory".</i>

470
00:50:11,108 --> 00:50:17,707
<i>Oga's work has the power
to awaken those memories within us.</i>

471
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:38,091
<i>Director Yoshifumi Kondo's
"Whisper of the Heart".</i>

472
00:50:38,102 --> 00:50:43,370
"WHISPER OF THE HEART" (1995)

473
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:50,242
<i>Satoshi Kuroda, who
had long worked under Oga...</i>

474
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:54,113
<i>...was selected to serve
as art director.</i>

475
00:50:55,319 --> 00:51:00,723
<i>The setting was modeled on
Tama City, in the Tokyo suburbs.</i>

476
00:51:01,225 --> 00:51:05,719
<i>The Tama Hills again served
as the backdrop for the story.</i>

477
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:13,161
<i>A major theme was the urban
environment as nostalgic home town.</i>

478
00:51:14,538 --> 00:51:19,305
<i>The question was whether
Ghibli's artists could breathe life...</i>

479
00:51:19,543 --> 00:51:21,671
<i>...into such an environment.</i>

480
00:51:22,846 --> 00:51:28,478
<i>The art staff made trips together
for detailed location scouting.</i>

481
00:51:32,356 --> 00:51:38,420
<i>"Whisper of the Heart" opens
with this panorama of the city by night.</i>

482
00:51:41,332 --> 00:51:46,771
<i>The film ends with the same view,
this time shrouded in morning mist.</i>

483
00:51:47,271 --> 00:51:52,175
<i>It's hard to tell
this is the same city.</i>

484
00:51:52,543 --> 00:51:57,777
<i>Oga was responsible
for both of these key images.</i>

485
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:05,345
This is based on the view from
atop the ski jump at Yomiuri Land.

486
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:14,921
We got permission to enter the park
very early in the morning.

487
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:19,027
I took the first
morning train out there.

488
00:52:19,203 --> 00:52:24,471
I saw the same sunrise
that was depicted in the story.

489
00:52:27,845 --> 00:52:29,176
<i>"Whisper" sensitively portrayed...</i>

490
00:52:29,413 --> 00:52:32,542
<i>...the emotional lives
of middle school students.</i>

491
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:38,218
<i>The final scene is
dedicated to their future.</i>

492
00:53:09,653 --> 00:53:11,917
I wanted you to see this.

493
00:53:18,462 --> 00:53:23,195
"Princess Mononoke".

494
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,295
"PRINCESS MONONOKE" (1997)

495
00:53:28,338 --> 00:53:32,206
<i>This enormous background
forms part of the exhibit.</i>

496
00:53:33,677 --> 00:53:36,874
<i>It was used in
the film's opening scene.</i>

497
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:43,817
<i>This awe-inspiring vista
remains on screen for 26 seconds.</i>

498
00:53:44,421 --> 00:53:48,881
<i>Eight large cels with images
of mountains and clouds...</i>

499
00:53:49,126 --> 00:53:52,096
<i>were photographed
over a large background.</i>

500
00:53:58,569 --> 00:54:05,100
In ancient times the land
lay covered in forest...

501
00:54:05,209 --> 00:54:10,670
...where from ages long past
dwelt the spirits of the gods.

502
00:54:22,192 --> 00:54:27,722
<i>No fewer than five art directors
were assigned to "Mononoke".</i>

503
00:54:28,499 --> 00:54:31,400
<i>This was unheard of.
Why was it necessary?</i>

504
00:54:32,536 --> 00:54:38,270
In "Princess Mononoke",
the hero travels south and west.

505
00:54:38,375 --> 00:54:43,074
Each art director handled
the region he grew up in.

506
00:54:43,881 --> 00:54:46,407
Oga did most of
the northern backgrounds.

507
00:54:47,718 --> 00:54:51,177
<i>A representative scene
from each art director.</i>

508
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:54,153
- <i>The Em/sh/ Village.</i>
- <i>Ash/take's Journey.</i>

509
00:54:54,258 --> 00:54:58,354
- <i>The Iron Works-</i> - <i>Moro's Lair.</i>
- <i>The Deer God's Forest.</i>

510
00:54:58,462 --> 00:55:04,458
<i>With five art directors,
the settings were extremely varied.</i>

511
00:55:08,172 --> 00:55:10,539
<i>Ashitaka's home,
the "Emishi Village".</i>

512
00:55:10,774 --> 00:55:12,242
<i>This was Oga's responsibility.</i>

513
00:55:17,347 --> 00:55:20,442
<i>Oga's village was based
on the Shirakami highlands...</i>

514
00:55:20,684 --> 00:55:23,779
<i>...and the Shizukuishi
area in northern Japan.</i>

515
00:55:30,027 --> 00:55:35,261
<i>While other staff headed south
to scout forest locations...</i>

516
00:55:35,766 --> 00:55:39,669
<i>...Oga traveled alone
to northern Japan.</i>

517
00:55:41,972 --> 00:55:47,138
<i>He saw mountain highlands
and pristine beech forests</i>

518
00:55:47,411 --> 00:55:51,075
<i>The images he brought back
majestically open the story.</i>

519
00:56:18,308 --> 00:56:24,577
<i>Oga was responsible for
many striking images in "Mononoke".</i>

520
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:33,588
<i>The awe-inspiring sunrise
over the Deer God's forest.</i>

521
00:56:47,838 --> 00:56:51,866
<i>The giant Deer God
rises into the night sky.</i>

522
00:57:01,652 --> 00:57:05,145
<i>Life returns
to the ravaged forest.</i>

523
00:57:10,861 --> 00:57:16,425
<i>What did Oga have in mind
when he created this image?</i>

524
00:57:18,669 --> 00:57:21,036
When I was scouting locations...

525
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:25,071
...I saw green shoots coming up
in places where the snow had melted.

526
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:29,769
I used that image
for this background.

527
00:57:42,526 --> 00:57:45,461
<i>During the creation of
backgrounds like these...</i>

528
00:57:45,696 --> 00:57:49,064
<i>...the director provides feedback
at meeting after meeting.</i>

529
00:57:50,067 --> 00:57:52,764
<i>During production of
"Princess Mononoke"...</i>

530
00:57:53,003 --> 00:57:56,132
<i>...one of these meetings
was preserved on video.</i>

531
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:02,578
<i>Studio Ghibli, during
production of "Mononoke".</i>

532
00:58:02,779 --> 00:58:06,340
<i>Oga shows director Miyazaki
one of the backgrounds.</i>

533
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:11,585
<i>Shafts of sunlight illuminate
the lake of the Deer God.</i>

534
00:58:11,822 --> 00:58:14,689
<i>Miyazaki sees room
for improvement.</i>

535
00:58:14,825 --> 00:58:18,193
The light should fall a bit more naturally.

536
00:58:22,666 --> 00:58:24,896
Like it's always that way.

537
00:58:25,369 --> 00:58:28,361
The location was dark, right?

538
00:58:28,605 --> 00:58:31,336
That's how it looked.

539
00:58:31,441 --> 00:58:34,877
If we make it too dark...

540
00:58:34,978 --> 00:58:37,276
...this part will be black.

541
00:58:37,381 --> 00:58:41,648
I think if we just add
a few more rays of light -

542
00:58:41,785 --> 00:58:45,653
This part can be in shade.

543
00:58:45,756 --> 00:58:49,750
But there should be
light falling here and there.

544
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:58,026
The beams of light should be
distributed across the frame.

545
00:58:59,136 --> 00:59:02,800
I kept thinking the light was too bright...

546
00:59:04,674 --> 00:59:07,473
...but I think this is OK.

547
00:59:08,045 --> 00:59:09,535
I don't think...

548
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:12,841
...we have to make this ultra-realistic.

549
00:59:13,617 --> 00:59:15,608
How can I say...

550
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:19,519
...we don't have to make this look real.

551
00:59:19,756 --> 00:59:23,522
I'd like it to have a lot of impact.

552
00:59:23,627 --> 00:59:26,289
Sometimes even real sunlight...

553
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:28,364
...looks very majestic...

554
00:59:28,465 --> 00:59:32,732
...when it shoots down from the clouds.

555
00:59:34,771 --> 00:59:38,298
We need light beams from
more than one place.

556
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:45,507
<i>Based on Miyazakﬂs storyboard,
the art director creates an image.</i>

557
00:59:46,049 --> 00:59:50,043
<i>Seeing the image, the director
further develops his vision.</i>

558
00:59:55,325 --> 01:00:00,286
<i>Using all his skill, the artist
realizes that vision in more images.</i>

559
01:00:00,397 --> 01:00:03,856
<i>This is the role
of the image artisan.</i>

560
01:00:08,939 --> 01:00:16,710
"SPIRITED AWAY" (2001) "HOWL'S MOVING
CASTLE" (2004) "TALES FROM EARTHSEA" (2006)

561
01:00:25,689 --> 01:00:28,624
<i>A residential development
cut into a hill.</i>

562
01:00:29,059 --> 01:00:33,155
<i>This is the opening image
from "Spirited Away".</i>

563
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:42,295
<i>Deep in the forest, a gateway
to a mysterious town.</i>

564
01:00:45,942 --> 01:00:51,108
<i>Oga created this imposing
red gate amid lush foliage.</i>

565
01:01:01,558 --> 01:01:07,258
<i>Chihiro and Haku pass through
this garden of rhododendrons.</i>

566
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:16,466
<i>Here is Oga's background,
rendered with computer animation.</i>

567
01:01:31,788 --> 01:01:36,089
<i>The magical marshes
from "Howl's Moving Castle".</i>

568
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:45,699
<i>A vast expanse of meadows
and flowers of dreamlike beauty.</i>

569
01:01:59,182 --> 01:02:03,710
Of course, each flower had to be
added by hand, one by one.

570
01:02:03,954 --> 01:02:08,790
I can't imagine
how many I painted.

571
01:02:10,527 --> 01:02:14,191
<i>How long did it take you?</i>

572
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:17,264
I don't even remember
how long it took.

573
01:02:22,005 --> 01:02:26,670
<i>The flowers in the foreground
are rendered precisely.</i>

574
01:02:26,876 --> 01:02:29,607
<i>Those in the distance
are less detailed.</i>

575
01:02:30,247 --> 01:02:33,740
<i>This marked contrast between
rough and detailed rendering...</i>

576
01:02:33,984 --> 01:02:36,578
<i>“imparts a feeling
of broad expanse.</i>

577
01:02:50,867 --> 01:02:53,962
<i>Ghib/I artist Na 0 ya Tanaka
sees something special...</i>

578
01:02:54,204 --> 01:02:56,832
<i>...in Oga's depictions
of foreign environments.</i>

579
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:06,515
I think Oga's European
environments are superb.

580
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:10,311
When Oga sets out
to depict a scene...

581
01:03:10,553 --> 01:03:15,457
...that he has not seen personally,
he proceeds slowly and carefully.

582
01:03:15,959 --> 01:03:19,088
He examines reference
photographs very closely.

583
01:03:19,596 --> 01:03:22,258
He looks very
carefully at buildings.

584
01:03:22,766 --> 01:03:26,327
He notes differences in
the style of roofs...

585
01:03:26,569 --> 01:03:28,799
...or the way signs look.

586
01:03:29,306 --> 01:03:33,334
Roads and structures are different
from their Japanese counterparts.

587
01:03:33,843 --> 01:03:36,972
He takes all this
carefully into account.

588
01:03:40,417 --> 01:03:42,909
<i>"Tales from Earthsea"
also contains scenes...</i>

589
01:03:43,153 --> 01:03:46,487
<i>...that are completely different
by night and day.</i>

590
01:03:49,893 --> 01:03:53,056
<i>Oga's backgrounds played
a central role...</i>

591
01:03:53,396 --> 01:03:56,422
<i>...in this tale of the struggle
between light and darkness.</i>

592
01:03:58,868 --> 01:04:02,998
<i>0ga's backgrounds also
impart a sense of majesty...</i>

593
01:04:03,239 --> 01:04:07,369
<i>...to the Ghibli stories
in which they appear.</i>

594
01:04:22,926 --> 01:04:26,920
<i>Art directors often look to Oga
to handle certain scenes.</i>

595
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:30,398
<i>These scenes have
certain special characteristics.</i>

596
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:33,861
<i>What might those be?</i>

597
01:04:34,938 --> 01:04:38,306
<i>Yoji Takes-hiya was
art' director for "Spirited A way".</i>

598
01:04:38,641 --> 01:04:42,009
<i>He offers some insight
into Oga's special strengths.</i>

599
01:04:42,746 --> 01:04:47,343
There are several types
of backgrounds I'd want Oga to handle.

600
01:04:48,084 --> 01:04:51,918
One would be comparatively
soothing backgrounds.

601
01:04:52,021 --> 01:04:56,754
Refreshing or
heart-warming backgrounds.

602
01:04:56,893 --> 01:05:02,093
When I see this kind of
scene in a storyboard...

603
01:05:02,365 --> 01:05:07,030
...I would want Oga's
backgrounds for that scene.

604
01:05:08,004 --> 01:05:11,463
<i>Over 200,000 people
saw Oga's exhibition.</i>

605
01:05:11,641 --> 01:05:18,047
<i>What is so alluring about animation
backgrounds without characters?</i>

606
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:20,580
I think animation backgrounds...

607
01:05:20,817 --> 01:05:24,048
...are very accessible
for the average person.

608
01:05:24,621 --> 01:05:28,114
That's because backgrounds
aren't solely the creation...

609
01:05:28,358 --> 01:05:31,350
...of the artist
who created them.

610
01:05:31,561 --> 01:05:34,394
They were created
to fill a need.

611
01:05:35,365 --> 01:05:41,327
Backgrounds don't express
the artist's inner world.

612
01:05:41,738 --> 01:05:44,867
The viewer can
easily relate to them.

613
01:05:44,974 --> 01:05:49,741
That's a major characteristic
of background art.

614
01:05:59,122 --> 01:06:02,558
<i>Animation backgrounds
are only part of what Oga does.</i>

615
01:06:02,659 --> 01:06:06,152
<i>He is active
in many other areas.</i>

616
01:06:09,232 --> 01:06:11,257
<i>Oga supplied lively illustrations...</i>

617
01:06:11,501 --> 01:06:14,562
<i>...for Soseki Yamamoto's story,
"Mouse Tempura".</i>

618
01:06:17,407 --> 01:06:22,402
<i>In the story, a group of men
try to swindle foxes and raccoons...</i>

619
01:06:22,612 --> 01:06:27,140
<i>...by offering them mouse tempura
in exchange for huge fish.</i>

620
01:06:27,283 --> 01:06:31,982
<i>It's a story replete with natural beauty
and humorous characters.</i>

621
01:06:36,125 --> 01:06:39,584
<i>To transmit the experiences
of atom bomb survivors...</i>

622
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:43,823
<i>...actress Sayuri Yoshinaga produced
a CD titled "Second Movement".</i>

623
01:06:44,033 --> 01:06:48,595
<i>The CD contains poems and recollections
by survivors of the bombing.</i>

624
01:06:57,614 --> 01:07:02,245
"BAREFOOT GEN"
BACKGROUND

625
01:07:02,252 --> 01:07:06,917
<i>...as well as the series
of books based on it.</i>

626
01:07:07,524 --> 01:07:11,290
<i>It was Yoshinaga's strong desire...</i>

627
01:07:11,461 --> 01:07:15,955
<i>...to have Oga
provide the illustrations.</i>

628
01:07:22,272 --> 01:07:26,300
"SECOND MOVEMENT:
FROM NAGASAKI"

629
01:07:41,491 --> 01:07:47,863
<i>Oga's first work as director is
"The Night of Taneyamagahara".</i>

630
01:07:51,634 --> 01:07:56,595
<i>Oga presents Kenji Miyazawa's drama
in traditional story card format.</i>

631
01:08:05,548 --> 01:08:09,212
<i>Filled with heart-warming images,
Oga's retelling...</i>

632
01:08:09,452 --> 01:08:13,650
<i>...is a fresh approach
to this famous story.</i>

633
01:08:14,424 --> 01:08:17,951
He's lonely and can't sleep.

634
01:08:18,461 --> 01:08:21,226
People and birds,
they're no different.

635
01:08:24,133 --> 01:08:28,832
Kisuke and Kakko came already,
and the mowing's done.

636
01:08:32,575 --> 01:08:36,637
<i>Oga's work beyond the realm
of animation backgrounds...</i>

637
01:08:36,879 --> 01:08:40,975
<i>...conveys the same feelings
of peace and nostalgia.</i>

638
01:08:49,258 --> 01:08:54,662
This is something I like
to point out to people.

639
01:08:54,764 --> 01:08:58,997
See here?
Those are dendrobium orchids.

640
01:08:59,469 --> 01:09:03,770
It's a parasitic plant
that grows around Mt. Takao.

641
01:09:03,873 --> 01:09:07,332
You can see them
in May and June.

642
01:09:07,477 --> 01:09:10,674
I just added these on a whim.
But no one notices them.

643
01:09:18,588 --> 01:09:24,584
<i>0ga's orchids are the product of
attention to detail, a playful mind...</i>

644
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:29,295
<i>...and a deep attachment
to the natural world.</i>

645
01:09:45,481 --> 01:09:52,444
<i>These little flowers are the work
of a quintessential image artisan.</i>

646
01:09:53,289 --> 01:09:57,624
What I try to do
is create backgrounds...

647
01:09:57,994 --> 01:10:02,989
...that do justice
to the actual setting.

648
01:10:05,068 --> 01:10:07,002
That includes natural phenomena...

649
01:10:07,236 --> 01:10:11,104
...such as the wind blowing
or snow falling.

650
01:10:11,841 --> 01:10:17,541
I want my backgrounds
to encompass all these things.

651
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:32,687
<i>Kazuo Oga,
Studio Ghibli's image artisan.</i>

652
01:11:36,425 --> 01:11:37,915
<i>Oga has said...</i>

653
01:11:38,161 --> 01:11:43,099
<i>”There are no fixed colors
for plants or natural scenery.</i> ”

654
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:46,492
<i>In animation backgrounds
yet to come...</i>

655
01:11:46,736 --> 01:11:50,502
<i>...who knows what colors
Kazuo Oga will discover?</i>
