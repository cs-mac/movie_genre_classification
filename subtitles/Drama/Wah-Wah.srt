1
00:01:27,584 --> 00:01:30,613
Wake up Grace!

2
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:32,351
Our super engineer

3
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:35,056
Boss, the deadline is noon today!

4
00:01:35,165 --> 00:01:36,428
Where are your drawings?

5
00:01:36,534 --> 00:01:39,028
Sleep is a luxury you can't afford!

6
00:01:39,139 --> 00:01:40,437
It's all your fault!

7
00:01:40,542 --> 00:01:43,514
Those little fingers in your robot...

8
00:01:43,615 --> 00:01:45,174
are impossible to power...

9
00:01:45,284 --> 00:01:47,379
they're too small to fit the wires.

10
00:01:47,489 --> 00:01:51,519
But you're the miracle worker! You're Grace!

11
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,227
You'll find the solution! See you at noon?

12
00:01:54,335 --> 00:01:56,396
See you, bye!

13
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:12,392
You taught me well Courage is the best solution

14
00:02:12,504 --> 00:02:14,838
All problems can be solved

15
00:02:16,478 --> 00:02:19,712
How can a man whistle and brush
his teeth at the same time?

16
00:02:19,818 --> 00:02:22,152
He's brushing his dentures!

17
00:02:22,256 --> 00:02:23,224
Mom

18
00:02:23,325 --> 00:02:27,527
Which is the smallest island in the world?

19
00:02:28,234 --> 00:02:30,204
Asafety island on a busy road!

20
00:02:30,305 --> 00:02:32,332
You're good

21
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:34,675
Mom, how about this one?

22
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,948
Why do birds fly south in the winter?

23
00:02:39,222 --> 00:02:39,848
They don't like the cold?

24
00:02:39,957 --> 00:02:41,722
Nope!

25
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:45,825
Why do birds fly south? Because...

26
00:02:45,936 --> 00:02:47,461
they can't drive?

27
00:02:47,572 --> 00:02:50,237
You're so silly!

28
00:02:50,344 --> 00:02:53,316
Why do birds fly south? I know

29
00:02:53,417 --> 00:02:56,514
the flights are fully booked.

30
00:02:56,623 --> 00:03:00,357
Wrong! All the other parents get it right away!

31
00:03:00,463 --> 00:03:01,590
You must too!

32
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,230
But there're two of them... and I'm all alone!

33
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,537
I'll give you double the time then, bye!

34
00:03:07,644 --> 00:03:08,669
Bye

35
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:09,975
Don't forget to pick me later.

36
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,980
I won't!

37
00:03:15,292 --> 00:03:16,818
Bye

38
00:03:20,002 --> 00:03:21,732
Tinker!

39
00:03:24,477 --> 00:03:26,470
Bye Bye

40
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,636
Hello! Ada, I've got it!

41
00:03:59,745 --> 00:04:00,713
What do you have in mind?

42
00:04:00,814 --> 00:04:03,650
If we use a photo sensor

43
00:04:03,753 --> 00:04:06,486
then reaction speed will be fast.

44
00:04:06,592 --> 00:04:10,031
We won't need so many wires...

45
00:04:10,132 --> 00:04:12,034
problem solved?

46
00:04:12,136 --> 00:04:14,606
Wow! What inspired you?

47
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:18,112
Took a beautiful photo ofTinker just now...
the way the sun lit up her smile

48
00:04:18,382 --> 00:04:19,611
Good! Gotta go! We'll talk later! Bye!

49
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:20,582
Sure! See you later!

50
00:04:20,686 --> 00:04:22,155
Bye Bye

51
00:05:19,501 --> 00:05:21,767
Ma'am! Help me!

52
00:05:23,742 --> 00:05:27,203
I know nothing...

53
00:05:27,482 --> 00:05:29,645
Ma'am! Help me!

54
00:05:29,753 --> 00:05:33,193
I know nothing. Ma'am, please help me!

55
00:05:33,294 --> 00:05:35,160
Maria!

56
00:05:37,268 --> 00:05:42,837
Pleasehelp...

57
00:05:42,946 --> 00:05:45,212
Please don't kill me! Please...

58
00:05:45,317 --> 00:05:48,619
Don't kill me! Ma'am

59
00:07:19,934 --> 00:07:23,499
Help! Help!

60
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,044
Sis!

61
00:09:30,154 --> 00:09:32,625
You wanted to drive your son to the airport
Don't promise if you can't.

62
00:09:32,726 --> 00:09:34,525
We can go ourselves

63
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:35,723
Yes, I know

64
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,433
Sis, I'm at work.
Don't you think I want to be there...

65
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,266
I was really busy just now...

66
00:09:39,372 --> 00:09:41,604
Bob, you've got to take responsibility.

67
00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:44,772
Yourwife's gone. When will you grow up?

68
00:09:45,049 --> 00:09:48,146
We're off to Australia, and you may
not see yourson fora long time.

69
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:49,747
Sis, I was really working!

70
00:09:50,026 --> 00:09:51,689
Please tell Kit to come to the phone

71
00:09:51,796 --> 00:09:54,494
OK! But you've go to the airport
and say goodbye properly

72
00:09:54,601 --> 00:09:58,006
I'll check-in first, but I won't wait long.

73
00:09:59,211 --> 00:10:01,738
Kit, it's your dad.

74
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:04,645
Hello

75
00:10:04,754 --> 00:10:06,485
Kit

76
00:10:06,592 --> 00:10:10,395
Daddy is on the way to the airport

77
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,528
You go with Auntie Jeanie first.

78
00:10:13,638 --> 00:10:15,574
I'll see you there

79
00:10:15,675 --> 00:10:18,044
You're lying again!

80
00:10:18,147 --> 00:10:19,672
You never keep your promises

81
00:10:19,783 --> 00:10:23,051
You said mommy won't leave she left anyway!

82
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:24,420
Daddy swears I'll be there!

83
00:10:24,527 --> 00:10:26,690
Trust me once more, please?

84
00:10:26,797 --> 00:10:29,233
Take yourtime, so daddy can catch up with you?

85
00:10:29,335 --> 00:10:31,464
Let me speak to youraunt

86
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,842
Remember. A promise is a promise!

87
00:10:37,118 --> 00:10:39,554
Yes! I know! I'll be there! Thanks! Bye!

88
00:10:39,656 --> 00:10:41,387
There's nothing left!

89
00:10:41,493 --> 00:10:42,893
Broke again?!

90
00:10:43,162 --> 00:10:46,134
I've given you everything!

91
00:10:47,838 --> 00:10:50,434
There's nothing left!

92
00:10:50,543 --> 00:10:53,413
If I find anything... you're dead!

93
00:10:53,516 --> 00:10:55,918
Stop! He's gone! He doesn't live here any more

94
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:57,747
What are you staring at?

95
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:00,351
What are you doing? I'll kill you!

96
00:11:00,463 --> 00:11:02,329
Stop! Leave me son alone!

97
00:11:02,434 --> 00:11:04,768
He ran away, go find him!

98
00:11:04,871 --> 00:11:07,603
Bitch, listen to me. I'm not leaving
until I get what your husband owes.

99
00:11:07,711 --> 00:11:10,307
Now that he's gone, you'll have to pay up!

100
00:11:10,415 --> 00:11:12,214
You know the rules

101
00:11:12,319 --> 00:11:14,380
Mommy

102
00:11:15,726 --> 00:11:18,219
Let's go! Mommy

103
00:11:27,582 --> 00:11:30,918
Just give me something? Anything of value left?

104
00:11:31,189 --> 00:11:33,853
I can't go back empty-handed

105
00:11:45,818 --> 00:11:46,682
How did it go? Did you collect?

106
00:11:46,786 --> 00:11:48,653
No. She is dead broke

107
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:50,926
Where are my keys?
I've got to get to the airport

108
00:11:51,027 --> 00:11:51,790
Here.

109
00:11:51,896 --> 00:11:54,800
Give me some cash?
I'll need to leave town right now.

110
00:11:54,902 --> 00:11:55,733
What happened?

111
00:11:55,837 --> 00:11:58,034
Long story. This guy is after me

112
00:11:58,308 --> 00:11:59,834
I bought a gun for protection.

113
00:11:59,945 --> 00:12:02,541
Money!

114
00:12:12,503 --> 00:12:14,871
Just my luck, no battery.

115
00:12:15,909 --> 00:12:18,345
Hey, the gun is in your

116
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:36,743
Thank you for calling. Ourcustomer hotline

117
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:40,755
is busy right now, please call again later.

118
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:57,555
Sir, you're such an experienced
detective, any ideas?

119
00:12:59,861 --> 00:13:03,357
The whiff that cures all pain;
the smell of heaven!

120
00:13:03,468 --> 00:13:05,370
Cocaine

121
00:13:05,472 --> 00:13:11,541
This is definitely drug related.

122
00:13:11,818 --> 00:13:14,084
Wait...

123
00:13:21,904 --> 00:13:25,206
The car was set on fire at 3 am. Last night!

124
00:13:25,478 --> 00:13:30,853
West winds last night,
that's why the trunk is completely burnt.

125
00:13:32,024 --> 00:13:33,117
You believe me?

126
00:13:33,226 --> 00:13:33,921
Sure!

127
00:13:34,028 --> 00:13:36,897
Sucker! I'm just bluffing

128
00:13:37,001 --> 00:13:40,029
Hey, what do you think you're doing!

129
00:13:41,943 --> 00:13:45,713
Look! It's Supercop Fai! Salute!

130
00:13:45,817 --> 00:13:47,616
What a coincidence! Fluke Zhang!

131
00:13:47,721 --> 00:13:49,782
Who do you think you're!

132
00:13:49,892 --> 00:13:53,228
I'm Detective Zhang to you!

133
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:58,031
Look at the stars, Tristar Zhang.

134
00:13:58,242 --> 00:14:00,108
Let me introduce everyone

135
00:14:00,211 --> 00:14:04,778
This is Supercop Fai, my old supervisor

136
00:14:04,888 --> 00:14:10,160
He had many stars back then, now
he's directing traffic.

137
00:14:10,265 --> 00:14:12,827
What are you doing here?

138
00:14:13,871 --> 00:14:16,171
Guarding the crime scene

139
00:14:23,758 --> 00:14:27,162
This is evidence, take it back to my office!

140
00:14:27,264 --> 00:14:31,261
Sir, traffic is separatejurisdiction.

141
00:14:31,539 --> 00:14:35,673
I don't mind if I get to go home on time!

142
00:14:35,781 --> 00:14:39,117
Sir, give me an evidence bag

143
00:14:40,557 --> 00:14:42,993
Thanks!

144
00:14:44,932 --> 00:14:47,129
Your initials

145
00:14:48,739 --> 00:14:51,609
Stripping your medals definitely
improved yourtemper!

146
00:14:51,712 --> 00:14:56,882
Serves you right...
for all the hard times you gave me

147
00:14:57,289 --> 00:15:01,059
You begged for it back then

148
00:15:01,732 --> 00:15:04,726
What are you waiting for? Go!

149
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:07,876
I'm off

150
00:15:09,313 --> 00:15:09,904
Let's go!

151
00:15:10,014 --> 00:15:11,107
Yes, sir!

152
00:15:27,815 --> 00:15:29,284
Hello? Hello

153
00:15:29,385 --> 00:15:33,723
Hello! Mister, help!

154
00:15:33,827 --> 00:15:37,163
Help me! I beg you not to hang up!

155
00:15:37,267 --> 00:15:39,829
Miss, please stop with the prank calls,
thanks! Bye!

156
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,840
Mister, please!

157
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:45,279
My name is Grace Wong.

158
00:15:45,383 --> 00:15:47,819
I've been kidnapped

159
00:15:47,921 --> 00:15:50,984
I don't know where I am

160
00:15:51,094 --> 00:15:55,000
It was very difficult to make this connection

161
00:15:55,102 --> 00:15:57,938
I beg you not to hang up

162
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:02,277
Miss, maybe you should call the police instead?

163
00:16:02,383 --> 00:16:04,319
Your kidnappers seem nice enough

164
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,754
They even grant you access to a phone

165
00:16:06,858 --> 00:16:10,297
I'm telling the truth.

166
00:16:10,398 --> 00:16:13,131
They smashed the phone.

167
00:16:13,237 --> 00:16:16,073
It was very difficult to rewire
to get a connection

168
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:21,175
If you hang up,

00:23:30,853 --> 00:23:35,693
Go fetch her now, they're going after her

270
00:23:35,797 --> 00:23:38,063
Let me go to a police station and get help

271
00:23:38,168 --> 00:23:39,660

272

I need to get to the airport

273
00:23:40,873 --> 00:23:43,241
They've left already

274
00:23:43,344 --> 00:23:47,717
If you don't go, she'll die...

275
00:23:48,354 --> 00:23:52,385

276

I'm on my way.

282
00:24:39,287 --> 00:24:42,191
Who are those guys? What happened?

283
00:24:42,293 --> 00:24:43,955
What do they want with your brother?

284
00:24:44,062 --> 00:24:46,089
What did he do to them?

285
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,865
I know he is innocent.

286
00:24:48,972 --> 00:24:52,536
He just graduated from university.

287
00:24:52,813 --> 00:24:55,079
We're just a normal family

288
00:24:55,184 --> 00:24:57,211
I don't understand what's going on...

289
00:24:57,322 --> 00:25:00,419
What about your husband?
Maybe he messed with the wrong people?

290
00:25:00,528 --> 00:25:02,828
My husband is dead.

291
00:25:02,932 --> 00:25:06,963

I can only try to catch upno promises

532
00:41:28,647 --> 00:41:29,945
Don't watch that stuff!

533
00:41:30,049 --> 00:41:32,316
Porn gives you STD!

534
00:41:35,961 --> 00:41:38,397
You fixed my mobile yet?

535
00:41:38,499 --> 00:41:40,025
Yes! A lunatic

536
00:41:40,136 --> 00:41:41,764
Don't drop your phone into the sink again...

537
00:41:41,873 --> 00:41:42,703
attacked the principal...

538
00:41:42,807 --> 00:41:45,040
of a local school today and bit his hand...

539
00:41:45,146 --> 00:41:47,343

540
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:49,214
The man is deranged

541
00:41:49,321 --> 00:41:51,951
He said a student is being kidnapped.

542
00:41:52,059 --> 00:41:55,156
I told him I'm calling the cops

543
00:41:55,265 --> 00:41:58,830
He bit me and ran away

544
00:41:58,973 --> 00:42:01,375
The suspect then went to a mobile service center

545
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:03,447
Mr Tong, can you tell us what happened?

546
00:42:03,548 --> 00:42:05,450
He was very agitated at the time

547
00:42:05,719 --> 00:42:07,348
He was really worked up.

548
00:42:07,456 --> 00:42:09,483
He took out his gun and fired a shot

549
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,989
He paid $500 for a charger...

550
00:42:11,096 --> 00:42:12,998
that costs $199...

551
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:15,093
and told me to keep the change

552
00:42:15,204 --> 00:42:18,768

generous robberwho overtips!

Did he take any cash?

671
00:49:47,917 --> 00:49:49,613
Can you please hurry?

672
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:51,052
Just give me a moment.

673
00:49:51,157 --> 00:49:53,149
7

674
00:49:53,261 --> 00:49:55,162
7

675
00:49:55,264 --> 00:49:57,701
As a professional customer service agent,
my instinct tells me that he's crazy

676
00:49:57,803 --> 00:50:01,401
The suspect turns out to be a
generous robberwho leaves a tip!

677
00:50:40,519 --> 00:50:42,352
Stop! Don't move!

678
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:43,719
Don't move!

679
00:50:43,825 --> 00:50:44,520
Stop!

680
00:50:44,794 --> 00:50:46,161
Don't move! Hands in the air!

681
00:50:46,264 --> 00:50:47,391
Don't move! Police!

682
00:50:47,499 --> 00:50:48,524
Hands in the air!

683
00:50:48,802 --> 00:50:50,031
Stop!

684
00:50:50,137 --> 00:50:51,366
Hands in the air!

685
00:50:51,474 --> 00:50:53,443
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

686
00:50:53,544 --> 00:50:55,913
Don't move!

687
00:50:56,016 --> 00:50:58,282
Stop!

688
00:50:58,387 --> 00:51:00,448
Put your hands behind your head!

689
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:02,118
Don't move! Hands in the air!

690
00:51:02,228 --> 00:51:04,960
Senior Inspector

691
00:51:05,066 --> 00:51:08,801
We're Interpol, sorry about the misunderstanding

692
00:51:11,379 --> 00:51:14,078
What's going on?

693
00:51:14,786 --> 00:51:17,018
Interpol?

694
00:51:20,597 --> 00:51:22,931
What's going on?

695
00:51:23,035 --> 00:51:24,128
They're Interpol

696
00:51:24,237 --> 00:51:26,002
I'm really confused now. Who are the bad guys?

697
00:51:26,107 --> 00:51:30,104
Interpol? That's impossible!

698
00:51:30,549 --> 00:51:33,544
You've got to find my brother We'll know then

699
00:51:33,823 --> 00:51:35,849
Hurry!

700
00:51:39,834 --> 00:51:43,934
7

701
00:51:44,042 --> 00:51:47,537
7

702
00:51:47,650 --> 00:51:51,054
Get up, let's go

703
00:51:53,127 --> 00:51:54,026
What are you doing?

704
00:51:54,129 --> 00:51:56,292
We're friends.

705
00:51:57,335 --> 00:52:02,038
My leg... ouch! My leg!

706
00:52:02,144 --> 00:52:05,014
You're in great danger

707
00:52:05,117 --> 00:52:08,055
Some Interpol or kidnappers
are looking foryou...

708
00:52:08,156 --> 00:52:08,885
Excuse me miss

709
00:52:08,991 --> 00:52:09,685
May I help you?

710
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,930
Where is bed numberone?

711
00:52:12,030 --> 00:52:14,694
Here, talk to your sister
and you'll understand...

712
00:52:17,941 --> 00:52:18,601
Hello?

713
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:20,509
Roy?! Hello!

714
00:52:20,614 --> 00:52:22,914
What!

715
00:52:23,485 --> 00:52:25,352
You're not Roy!

716
00:52:25,456 --> 00:52:28,257
Man, she's looking for Roy!

717
00:52:28,362 --> 00:52:31,061
I don't have a sister.

718
00:52:31,168 --> 00:52:33,331
How can you not have a sister?

719
00:52:33,439 --> 00:52:37,504
You're not Roy Wong? Roy...

720
00:52:37,613 --> 00:52:39,047
Just my luck...

721
00:52:39,149 --> 00:52:40,310
I'm so sorry. I made a mistake.

722
00:52:40,418 --> 00:52:42,719
Total my car last night

723
00:52:42,990 --> 00:52:43,479
Overthere

724
00:52:43,591 --> 00:52:44,422
Thank you

725
00:52:44,526 --> 00:52:46,428
Definitely not my day

726
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:48,500
I don't have a sister...

727
00:52:48,601 --> 00:52:51,698
I've a brother

728
00:52:51,974 --> 00:52:54,639
So what if I don't have a sister...

729
00:53:10,410 --> 00:53:15,044
Yourfriend died horribly
Do you want tojoin him?

730
00:53:16,154 --> 00:53:18,147
Where is it?

731
00:53:18,259 --> 00:53:20,354
I don't know.

732
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:26,333
Do you want your sister and niece

733
00:53:26,441 --> 00:53:28,411
to end up like yourfriend?

734
00:53:28,512 --> 00:53:30,482
Take me to it!

735
00:53:31,418 --> 00:53:32,852
What are you doing? He can't leave yet.

736
00:53:33,121 --> 00:53:35,250
We're Interpol He has information we need.

737
00:53:35,358 --> 00:53:37,487
The police will explain later.

738
00:53:40,168 --> 00:53:42,434
They've got him

739
00:54:21,782 --> 00:54:22,442
Sis!

740
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:23,518
Roy!

741
00:54:23,619 --> 00:54:25,589
Are you OK? Where is Tinker?

742
00:54:25,690 --> 00:54:27,420
I don't know. They took her.

743
00:54:27,527 --> 00:54:30,761
Are you OK? Roy! Sis! Sis!

744
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:37,577
Give me the camera and I'll let your sister go.

745
00:54:38,381 --> 00:54:40,442
I don't know where it is.

746
00:54:40,552 --> 00:54:42,886
I fell and passed out

747
00:54:42,990 --> 00:54:45,962
I need to retrace my steps to find my backpack

748
00:54:47,498 --> 00:54:50,938
Go find it. No funny business.

749
00:54:51,206 --> 00:54:52,674
Now!

750
00:54:52,775 --> 00:54:54,608
Go!

751
00:54:58,587 --> 00:55:00,784
Bob, are you there?

752
00:55:00,891 --> 00:55:02,554
Where is my brother?

753
00:55:02,662 --> 00:55:06,032
They're going up the hill
I'm not sure what they're doing

754
00:55:06,302 --> 00:55:09,274
Are there a lot of people flying planes?

755
00:55:10,677 --> 00:55:11,576
Yes!

756
00:55:11,679 --> 00:55:13,876
He likes flying planes here

757
00:55:13,983 --> 00:55:16,454
Whateverthey're looking for,
it's got to be nearby

758
00:55:16,555 --> 00:55:17,420
You've got to get it first

759
00:55:17,524 --> 00:55:20,690
If they find it, that's the end.

760
00:55:39,466 --> 00:55:41,937
I think it's here

761
00:55:54,429 --> 00:55:56,899
Watch out! My plane is new!

762
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,095
No worries, I'm a pro!

763
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:16,530
Watch out! We're going to crash.

764
00:56:23,418 --> 00:56:25,513
Found it!

765
00:56:35,008 --> 00:56:36,671
Don't move! Come here!

766
00:56:36,778 --> 00:56:38,771
Stand back

767
00:56:46,095 --> 00:56:47,120
Here! Get down!

768
00:56:47,231 --> 00:56:50,671
No! Please don't! Help!

769
00:57:02,962 --> 00:57:05,957
Help! Someone fired a gun!

770
00:58:00,173 --> 00:58:02,143
Honey! I'll love you foreternity...

771
00:58:02,243 --> 00:58:05,010
and protect you always

772
00:58:07,187 --> 00:58:08,348
Hey, hey!

773
00:58:08,622 --> 00:58:10,819
What do you want?

774
00:58:11,728 --> 00:58:13,197
Hey! Hey

775
00:58:13,299 --> 00:58:16,601
Once I get to safety, I'll call you

776
00:58:46,796 --> 00:58:48,993
Bob! Hello!

777
00:58:49,202 --> 00:58:50,363

Someone help!

01:00:21,948 --> 01:00:25,547
Help! Help! Anyone there?

787
01:00:32,569 --> 01:00:34,972
Help me! Help!

788
01:02:38,313 --> 01:02:41,444
(Clear out, leave now)

789
01:03:01,692 --> 01:03:04,391
Police! You're shooting at an officer.

790
01:03:04,498 --> 01:03:08,232
Surrenderyourweapon or I'll have to shoot you

791
01:04:43,958 --> 01:04:46,622
The numberyou dialed is invalid

792
01:04:46,729 --> 01:04:47,992
Please try again.

793
01:04:48,099 --> 01:04:50,592
What are you doing? You little BITCH!

794
01:05:04,197 --> 01:05:05,893
You still wanna play?

795
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,405
Do you want to play?

796
01:05:26,907 --> 01:05:31,007
Sorry, if you don't want to die, don't move!

797

TinkerTinker

798

01:06:18,941 --> 01:06:21,913
Call out to me Tinker!

803
01:06:22,014 --> 01:06:22,982

Mommy has come to rescue you!

815
01:07:12,146 --> 01:07:14,639

Mommy! Mommy they're coming!

819
01:08:44,491 --> 01:08:48,932
Mommy! Let's go!

820
01:09:04,530 --> 01:09:08,264
Hey! Focus on the planes, not me!

821
01:09:08,371 --> 01:09:11,104
What is that?

822
01:09:26,038 --> 01:09:31,140
Tong, pack up the drugs and
dispose of the bodies!

823
01:09:33,988 --> 01:09:35,013
Hey! You!

824
01:09:35,123 --> 01:09:37,024
They saw us! Run!

825
01:09:37,127 --> 01:09:40,223
Hurry! Run! Faster...

826
01:10:00,973 --> 01:10:04,343
(Missed call from Grace)

827
01:10:32,434 --> 01:10:35,372
Who were you talking to?

828
01:10:35,474 --> 01:10:38,377
Astranger. Honest

829
01:10:38,479 --> 01:10:43,114
You told him to intervene!

830
01:10:43,222 --> 01:10:45,419
Please let them go

831
01:10:45,526 --> 01:10:48,794
You can do whatever you want with me.

832
01:10:49,066 --> 01:10:52,129
If you leave now, you still have time

833
01:10:54,544 --> 01:10:56,342
Did you think you can win?

834
01:10:56,447 --> 01:10:58,076
I never play to lose.

835
01:10:58,184 --> 01:11:00,177
I won't kill you

836
01:11:00,288 --> 01:11:03,124
I'll kill those you love.
Forthe rest of your life

837
01:11:03,227 --> 01:11:05,288
you can remember how your
daughterand brother died...

838
01:11:05,398 --> 01:11:10,101
The phone is smashed...
I can't reach him anymore

839
01:11:10,575 --> 01:11:13,843
If a loved one dies,
perhaps you'll do the right thing

840
01:11:17,823 --> 01:11:18,813

844
01:11:29,646 --> 01:11:32,846
I don't know how to find him!

845
01:11:32,952 --> 01:11:36,356
I really don't know how to find him!

846
01:12:04,847 --> 01:12:06,281

847

And you are?

849
01:12:10,726 --> 01:12:11,989
Your father!

850
01:12:12,261 --> 01:12:15,427
It's none of your business
Tell Grace to come to the phone.

851
01:12:16,903 --> 01:12:19,636

852
01:12:19,743 --> 01:12:24,309
I don't want to talk to you!
I want to talk to Grace! Now!

853
01:12:25,788 --> 01:12:27,849
You want your video?

854
01:12:27,959 --> 01:12:30,759
The one shows you killing these people?

855
01:12:31,499 --> 01:12:32,968
Let me talk to Grace.

856
01:12:33,069 --> 01:12:36,063
You're not calling the shots here!

857
01:12:36,342 --> 01:12:40,612
Give me the camera or I'll kill them all

858
01:12:40,717 --> 01:12:45,055
You're not calling the shots either

859
01:12:45,325 --> 01:12:49,060
Tell Grace to come to the phone...

860
01:12:49,333 --> 01:12:51,428
or I'll take the video
to the police right now.

861
01:13:16,420 --> 01:13:17,683
Hello?

862
01:13:17,789 --> 01:13:21,820
Mister, wait a second.

863
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:24,925
Bob, it's me.

864
01:13:25,036 --> 01:13:27,768
Grace? Are you OK?

865
01:13:27,875 --> 01:13:29,037
Thank you

866
01:13:29,144 --> 01:13:32,412
Not yet I'm in a lot of trouble also

867
01:13:32,517 --> 01:13:34,612
The cops are looking for me

868
01:13:34,722 --> 01:13:39,026
I'll tell them to go to take you to the airport
I'll think of something by then.

869
01:13:39,130 --> 01:13:40,963
Got it!

870
01:13:41,067 --> 01:13:43,799
I need a favorfrom you.

871
01:13:45,175 --> 01:13:47,907
If anything happens to me

872
01:13:48,014 --> 01:13:50,645
please tell my son

873
01:13:50,753 --> 01:13:55,217
that for once in my life

874
01:13:55,495 --> 01:13:58,433
I've done what I set out to do.

875
01:14:03,644 --> 01:14:06,445
What next, Mr Hero?

876
01:14:06,550 --> 01:14:10,547
Go to the airport now. I'll call you

877
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:28,515
The doorwas pried open

878
01:14:28,626 --> 01:14:32,156
We found jewelry on the victim

879
01:14:32,735 --> 01:14:36,265
Wow, what happened?! Killing an Interpol agent

880
01:14:36,541 --> 01:14:39,945
How do you plan to explain this?

881
01:14:40,116 --> 01:14:43,611
Sir, someone kidnapped the ownerof this house.

882
01:14:43,722 --> 01:14:45,247
She's probably in great danger

883
01:14:45,526 --> 01:14:49,626
Who do you think you are?

884
01:14:49,834 --> 01:14:54,138
You're not a detective anymore
In fact, you're under investigation!

885
01:14:54,243 --> 01:14:57,545
You've seen the place

886
01:14:57,649 --> 01:15:00,017
Obviously something is wrong.

887
01:15:00,121 --> 01:15:04,083
You WERE my supervisor
Stop telling me what to do.

888
01:15:07,101 --> 01:15:09,902
There must be more of them.

889
01:15:10,007 --> 01:15:11,943
Are you one of them?!

890
01:15:12,044 --> 01:15:13,774
You two broke in to rob the house

891
01:15:13,881 --> 01:15:15,315
Killed the maid

892
01:15:15,584 --> 01:15:19,354
Your partner got greedy so you killed hertoo?
That's my theory

893
01:15:19,625 --> 01:15:25,000
Forold time's sake,
I'm not locking you up, PC2004...

894
01:15:25,303 --> 01:15:29,300
Even if you've nothing to do with this
An off-duty cop trespassing on private property

895
01:15:29,411 --> 01:15:31,381
You'll lose your last medal

896
01:15:31,648 --> 01:15:34,620
You don't have anymore to lose

897
01:15:37,025 --> 01:15:38,426
Take anotherstatement

898
01:15:38,696 --> 01:15:40,723
Make sure it's satisfactory

899
01:15:40,833 --> 01:15:42,233
Yes, sir.

900
01:15:42,336 --> 01:15:44,933
Commander Wong is here.

901
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:46,772
Fool, why not keep him waiting until midnight?

902
01:15:46,879 --> 01:15:49,748
(Abrupt change, go to airport now)

903
01:15:54,426 --> 01:15:56,828
Hello?

904
01:16:01,239 --> 01:16:02,731
Kit!

905
01:16:02,843 --> 01:16:05,143
Daddy! Where are you?

906
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:06,340
Listen...

907
01:16:06,449 --> 01:16:08,442
I need to rescue someone. I'm on my way

908
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:10,849
Wait for me! You understand?

909
01:16:10,958 --> 01:16:15,228
You're lying. You're not going to make it

910
01:16:15,334 --> 01:16:16,859
It's almost time!

911
01:16:16,970 --> 01:16:19,065
I'm on my way...

912
01:16:19,174 --> 01:16:21,303
I'm coming... at rocket speed...

913
01:16:21,412 --> 01:16:24,009
Let me talk to him

914
01:16:25,787 --> 01:16:27,381
No show again?!

915
01:16:27,490 --> 01:16:29,892
I'm giving you five more minutes.

916
01:16:29,995 --> 01:16:33,457
Next time, you'll have to fly out to see him
Bye!

917
01:17:04,329 --> 01:17:05,524
(Message from Michelle)

918
01:17:05,798 --> 01:17:08,098
(I'm off to the airport.
Where should we meet up?)

919
01:17:11,342 --> 01:17:13,369
(Terminal One)

920
01:17:14,081 --> 01:17:15,447
Yes!

921
01:17:18,289 --> 01:17:19,154
Hello?

922
01:17:19,258 --> 01:17:21,125
Little Zhang, Master Fai here...

923
01:17:21,228 --> 01:17:24,496
I thought I told you to file a statement?

928
01:17:35,389 --> 01:17:37,986
You believe me?

929
01:17:38,095 --> 01:17:39,324
You know who's behind all this?

930
01:17:39,430 --> 01:17:42,596
Not yet, but I'd find out soon enough
You believe me?

931
01:17:42,870 --> 01:17:44,065
You've got evidence?

932
01:17:44,172 --> 01:17:46,142
Yes Do you believe me?

933
01:17:46,243 --> 01:17:49,374
I believe you What do you want?

934
01:17:49,483 --> 01:17:52,182
Asalute for Master Fai!

935
01:18:00,204 --> 01:18:01,695
Master Fai

936
01:18:01,974 --> 01:18:03,500
You're an asshole.

937
01:18:03,611 --> 01:18:07,380
Airport. Hurry Don't screw up

938
01:18:07,484 --> 01:18:10,012

01:18:17,538 --> 01:18:19,235
Hello?

940
01:18:19,341 --> 01:18:21,139
You watch your mouth!

941
01:18:21,244 --> 01:18:24,239
If it wasn't me, you'd have nothing.

942
01:18:27,623 --> 01:18:30,220
I think he took the camera.

943
01:18:30,329 --> 01:18:32,390
60397043

944
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:35,438

Hostages?

951
01:19:47,879 --> 01:19:51,876
Of course we brought them
How do you want to do this?

952
01:19:52,154 --> 01:19:56,458
Go to Parking Lot 2, I'll tell you what to do

953
01:19:56,563 --> 01:19:59,660
No problem.

954
01:20:05,781 --> 01:20:09,448
Drive them to parking lot numbertwo.

960

It's time! We've got to go!

961
01:20:31,965 --> 01:20:33,696
Let's do a deal

962
01:20:33,803 --> 01:20:37,264
Tell me how much and I'll see what we can do.

963
01:20:37,376 --> 01:20:39,812
Let's talk about this face-to-face.

964
01:20:39,914 --> 01:20:42,818

01:22:07,551 --> 01:22:09,111
Not yet its confirmed that the suspect is here.

976
01:22:09,388 --> 01:22:10,481
Did you bring a full team?

977
01:22:10,590 --> 01:22:13,060
Relax! Don't do anything without my order!

978
01:22:13,161 --> 01:22:15,154

979
01:22:17,003 --> 01:22:20,407
Tong, you were closest to him
What does he look like?

980
01:22:20,509 --> 01:22:22,638
I was behind him

981
01:22:22,747 --> 01:22:25,617
Chinese, dark hair, glasses,

982
01:22:25,719 --> 01:22:29,215

Satisfied? You spoke with her.

987
01:22:54,508 --> 01:22:58,209
Now give me the camera and I'll release them.

988
01:22:58,483 --> 01:23:00,146
I'm calling the shots!

989
01:23:00,253 --> 01:23:02,246
I'll tell you what to do!

990
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:23,698
You can see the car.

991
01:23:23,799 --> 01:23:28,331
Tell them to turn towards the exit

992
01:23:28,609 --> 01:23:33,107
Roll down the window and I want to see them

993
01:23:33,217 --> 01:23:38,353
Turn the cartowards the exit,
roll down the windows

994
01:23:43,203 --> 01:23:46,175
Search the departure area.
He has a view of the parking lot

995
01:23:46,276 --> 01:23:48,178
Copy! Copy that!

996
01:23:49,048 --> 01:23:51,143

997
01:24:13,329 --> 01:24:18,066

Turn the car around

999
01:24:32,166 --> 01:24:37,130

1000
01:25:08,836 --> 01:25:11,501
Happy now?

1001

Stop jerking me around.

1002
01:25:20,325 --> 01:25:24,060
See the patrol car parked straight ahead.

1003
01:25:24,166 --> 01:25:28,163
Let them go.
Once they get inside, I'll give you your video.

1004
01:25:28,275 --> 01:25:30,404
No deal

1005
01:25:30,812 --> 01:25:32,441
Goods must changed hands at the same time.

01:28:59,451 --> 01:29:01,546
Everything's fine now

1048
01:29:05,430 --> 01:29:07,593
Where's the evidence?

1049
01:29:07,701 --> 01:29:10,969
I hid it in the men's room

1050
01:29:11,507 --> 01:29:15,379
Sorry, police at work, no entry.

1051

1057
01:30:25,017 --> 01:30:27,579

1060
01:30:48,062 --> 01:30:50,794
Must be hard reporting to Zhang?

1061
01:30:50,901 --> 01:30:53,771
Which precinct are you from?

1062
01:30:59,150 --> 01:31:01,678
When did youjoin the force?

1063
01:31:10,239 --> 01:31:12,505

1072
01:32:20,742 --> 01:32:24,876

I'm the one who serves truejustice!

1081

They deserve to die!

1083

01:34:34,401 --> 01:34:38,603
Call me a fluke?!
Why can't youjust let things be?

1085
01:37:33,282 --> 01:37:34,945
Damn!

1086
01:37:39,194 --> 01:37:44,831
This is the heroic death you're looking for

1087
01:37:46,508 --> 01:37:48,842
Die!

1088

Stop!

1091
01:38:00,268 --> 01:38:03,672
Guess this takes us to overtime

1092
01:38:03,775 --> 01:38:05,004
I lose, give it to me.

1093
01:38:05,278 --> 01:38:08,648

It's you! Stand up!

1107

You're under arrest for robbery!

1108
01:41:36,655 --> 01:41:38,215
Turn around!

1109
01:41:38,959 --> 01:41:39,426

1110
01:41:39,694 --> 01:41:40,753

Yes, but I've got to follow protocols...

1114
01:41:47,142 --> 01:41:48,736
What protocols?! Let me handle it...

Thanks for believing in me

No need to thank me. Just doing my job!

1121
01:42:14,929 --> 01:42:19,394
See what you've done
looks like I'd be on along medical leave

1122
01:42:19,505 --> 01:42:22,374
Good business for my doctor

1123

Look, I should thank you

1124

01:42:42,984 --> 01:42:46,013
Thanks for sending the video to the police

1129
01:42:46,124 --> 01:42:47,854
You go bask in the limelight

1130
01:42:47,960 --> 01:42:50,898
I need to run home to cook my wife dinner

1131
01:42:50,999 --> 01:42:55,532
let's not meet again

1132
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:05,858
Hey, one more thing... what do you do?

1133
01:43:07,165 --> 01:43:10,000
I'm a debt collector...

1134
01:43:10,604 --> 01:43:13,940
Batman is a more suitable calling!

1135
01:43:30,075 --> 01:43:33,947
This is a live broadcast from the airport

1136
01:43:34,050 --> 01:43:37,022
According to our sources,
this man has been secretly...

1137
01:43:37,123 --> 01:43:39,593
helping the police since early afternoon

1138
01:43:39,694 --> 01:43:41,288
It's daddy!

1139
01:43:41,398 --> 01:43:47,035
It's daddy! It's daddy!

1140
01:43:47,142 --> 01:43:51,412
Look! It's daddy!

1141
01:44:15,464 --> 01:44:16,693
Hello?

1147
01:45:03,256 --> 01:45:06,752
You won't take my call again, will you?

1148
01:45:10,270 --> 01:45:14,836
If you're calling for help, no thanks!

1149
01:45:15,112 --> 01:45:19,348
If you want dinner,

1150
01:45:19,455 --> 01:45:22,255
I'd consider

1151
01:45:36,555 --> 01:45:38,889

01:45:40,663 --> 01:45:43,634
Daddy! Daddy!

1153
01:45:43,735 --> 01:45:49,475
